Prof. Vlad Binhi must be congratulated for tackling this question. Moreover, he has been careful to use A Scientific View in the subtitle. In so doing he makes a key distinction at the outset, bringing this subject out of the shadows and placing it squarely in a scientific context. For more than 50 years, this area has been the playground for assorted charlatans, nuts, conspiratorialists, and people who simply do not believe the laws of physics. As in most discussions surrounding the potential influence, whether harmful or beneficial, of electromagneti sm on humans, the loud presence of pseudosc ientific fringe elements has made it very difficult for serious workers to be heard. It is therefore very useful to find in Prof. Binhi's book a large source of references on this subject that is free of the usual unfiltered claims one normally has to deal with when it come to matters of mind control. Especially important in this regard are the relevant scientific reports from Eastern Europe, up to now not readily available in the West. There are two questions that those interested in this subject always ask: first, is mind control possible? and, second, is such stuff being practiced by the government? The answer to the first question depends on what is mea nt by mind control. There are many shades to defining how a mind can be manipulat ed. Simply because imbibing too much alcohol can cause a person to lose his inhibitions, if you help someone get drunk, then in effect you are manipulating that person's mind. A certain degree of mind control occurs under hypnosis, albeit in a limited way, closer to somnambuli sm. Mind control of yet another sort can occur in successful advertising campaigns, whether one is selling a new car or a politician. Can electromagnetic fields affect one's decisions in ways similar to what is observed in drunkenness, advertising campaigns or hypnosis? The answer is, very likely, yes. But if one stretches the meaning and takes an extreme position asking"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"vm Foreword whether electromagnetism could allow one individual to \"take over\" someone else's brain, this is another matter. Many people have homed in on this extreme view of electromagnetic neural effects, preferring to imagine what happens in a Grade B horror movie, rather than the less dramatic, but potentially important scientific possibilities. Not that this \"take-over\" scenario lacks a technological basis. It depends on the use of the acoustic response that sometimes occurs when the head is exposed to microwave signals, otherwise called microwave hearing. This microwave ­ induced acoustic response is a very real thing. I once had the good fortune to be flying to New Zealand in First Class in the first row, and noticed that for one particular position of my head, there was a distinct thumping sound, repeated every few seconds. When I asked the steward about this sound, he was very familiar with it, confirming what I already suspected, that it was due to the circulating radar beam in the nose of the 747. Of course, in principle one can modulate a high frequency signal with low frequency patterns that correspond to speech, and even electronically create certain statemen ts. If we were to assume that this was technically feasible, I doubt very much that mind \"take-over\" would ever occur. It is more likely that subjects would simply become greatly distracted, driven out of their minds, or even become suicidal. There are much easier methods to achieve these ends. In the same vein occasionally one hears talk about electromagnetically induced zombie-like effects, allegedly practiced by this or that government on unsuspecting citizens. Presumably, the word zombie is connected to what was popularized in film s like Night of the Living Dead, or The Island of Doctor Moreau, where already deceased victims walk around at night, always after sunset, expressionless, with hands outstretched, mumbling incoherently, while searching out those who are still alive, with murderous intentions. These popular versions of what is meant by electromagnetic mind make it is necessary for the underlying definitions to be clearly stated. I prefer to divide the possibilities into three categorie s: mild effects similar to inducing sleep or losing one's inhibitions, way-out extreme effects, where one's mind is \"taken over\" by another human being or even a smart machine, and finally all the in-between, and probably more interesting, behavioral possibilities. It is well to recognize that devices in the first, or mild, category are already on the market, advertised as electromagnetic means for fighting insomnia. 1 In the middle category, one should be aware that electromagnetically induced changes in key traits such as aggressi veness, memory and learning , have all been observed in ra ts. There is good reason to think that these effects on important behavioral functions can also be made to occur in humans. Thus we think it"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Foreword IX highly feasible that we can induce loss of memory in people, make individuals more fearful or perhaps more willing to take chances, or simply compromise one's ability to make simple decisions. There can be no question that electromagnetic effects like these repre sent extraordinary opportunities for the military, to say nothing of corporate advertising or even political advancement. In the third, most extreme category I know of no experimental evidence to support the claims that one can electromagnetically \"take over\" someone else's mind, or otherwise make human zombies. The main reason driving this possibility is the microwave hearing effect, coupled with speculations, first that this effect can be technically transformed into a device that transmits thoughtful commands, and second that individuals who were unluckily at the receiving end of this device, would necessarily be willing to follow orders. It is one thing to interfere with one's actions, quite another to manipulate them. Looking more closely at the evidence for electromagnetically-induced behavioral effects, many of the most relevant experiments were hidden from view by the Cold War. One contribution to this literature is found in the Project Pandora Report, 2 dealing with the alleged microwave \"attack\" by the Soviet Union on the US Embassy in the 1950s. This report, prepared for the office of the US State Department, came to no clear conclusion. Thus, although the Russian government probably did direct microwave beams at the Embassy on Tchaikovsky Street, to this day the purpose remains unclear as do the consequences. In the US the most important research contributi ons to this area were made by two physicia n/scientists, W. Ross Adey and Robert 0. Becker. Both felt that electromagnetic mind control was inevitable. Adey concentrated on studying calcium effects in animal brain (cats, chicks) exposed to high frequency electromagnetic fields. Becker, working with Dr. Andrew Marino, concentrated on low frequency effects in humans. The seminal experiment 3 by Adey and Bawin showed that radiofrequency electromagnetic fields modulated at selective frequencies can have profound effects on calcium transport in brain tissue. One cannot minimize the lasting importance of this work, which in time came to be known as the calcium efflux experiment. It opened the door to many other findings, by scientists including Blackman, 4 myself,5 and Zhadin, 6 conclusively showing that there are truly remarkable interactions between electromagnetic fields and the brain. When it was first reported in the mid seventies there was great criticism of the experimental results, mainly because the old paradigm held that it was physically impossible to affect the brain with the extremely low electromagnetic intensities that were used."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"x Foreword It is commonly recognized that the laws of physics can be used to set lower limits on the field intensities that can interact with tissue in a meaningful way, that is provide electrical signals that are not swamped by naturally occurring electrical noise within the tissues. At higher intensities there are well recognized thermal effects (e.g., microwave heating). As such, it was difficult for many to believe that nonthermal fields were capable of affe cting brain function, and even harder to believe that such effects were only possible at certain frequencies. One of the by-products of the Ca efflux studies was a series of nonthermal experiments on rats starting in the mid-eighties showing that low frequency magnetic fields, specified according to a set of empirical rules termed ion cyclotron resonance (ICR), will have profound effects on rat behavior. The first of these, 7 by Dr. John Thomas and myself at the Naval Medical Research Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, found that in all cases tested, rats tempora rily lose their short-term memory after just one hour of exposure to ICR fields. Since then, successive experiments8-1 0 have shown that rats exposed to these magnetic field combinat ions can be made to learn either more quickly than controls or less, depending on the field combination that is used. These magnetic fields are also capable of producing greater aggressiveness or greater passivity, again as compared to controls. In effect, the way has been pointed towards selective frequency control of behavior. Further a connection has been hypothesized to explain these effects, connecting these magnetic field combinations to a key enzyme in the brain, the NMDA glutamate receptor. Glutamate has long been implicated by neuroph ysiologists in memory and learning. Given this strong likelihood that the concept is quite feasible, it is reasonable to assume that government would pursue this matter, if for no other reason than to be prepared in the event an unfriendly nation or group were to develop such technology for other than peaceful purposes. To illustrate this point, I recall once being approached by individuals from one of the US security agencies to render an opinion on the abilities of the \"seer\" Edgar Cayce. At first I was shocked by this request, but came to realize that responsible authorities felt it necessary to explore any possibility, no matter how remote from reality, in providing an edge for national security, even if this was something that I regarded as one step away from a side show at a circu s. I certainly think that governments have been actively involved for some time in trying to bring this possibility into reality. The underlying research is likely focused on two very different frequency ranges, first, at extremely low frequencies, from just one or two to several hundred hertz, and second, in the gigahertz region and beyond. It is also highly probable that signals encompassing"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Foreword Xl both frequencies would be of great interest. Even more important, there is every reason to think that additional, as yet untried electromagnetic modalities, other than the resonance techniques mentioned above, will also affect our behavior. In personal conversations with Dr. Becker, even some 25 years ago, he always maintained that both the US and Russian governments were very much involved in such research. But he also felt that there was a delib erate attempt by authorities to cover up these clandestine activities by means of delib erate disinformation tactics. These included weird and bizarre stories that were leaked to the public for one pur pose: to muddy the waters, to make the whole question of mind control seem absolutely unbelieva ble. For this reason alone we should be deeply indebted to Prof. Binhi. His work represents the first scholarly attempt to examine the reality of electromagnetic mind control in stark, scientific terms. In so doing he begins to unmuddy the waters. A. R.

Modem functional neuroimaging makes it possible to visualize and measure different brain functions, enabling one to detect the association of activity in a particular portion of the brain with the specific features of cognitive processes and behavior. The progress in cognitive studies has generated huge scientific, military, and governmental interest in the development and future applications of the neurotechno logies (NRC, 2008). Cognitive neuroscience has also created considerable public interest, which is accompanied by a large amount of pseudosc ientific information and journalistic exaggerati on. People are often concerned about possible use of electromagnetic (EM) 1 fields to read their minds and associate this possibility with the advances in neuroscience and microelectr onics. There are many publications, primarily in newspapers and popular magazines, discussing \"electromagnetic weapons\" and so-called \"electromagnetic mind control.\" This controversial theme originate s from two well-known facts: (i) EM fields and radiations can affect human beings and (ii) the impact of electromagnetic fields occurs invisibly and so it may be used covertly on unwitting people without their consent. Particula rly intriguing is the idea that relatively weak EM fields can affect the human brain causing specific mental processes, conscious or subconscious, which raises the prospect of control of the human mind. 1 Abbreviation s: ac - alternating current, de - direct current, cw - continuou s wave, RF - radiofrequ ency, EEG - electroen cephalogram, EM - electromagneti c, MF - magnetic field, EMF - electromagnetic field, IMS - transcranial magnetic stimulation, MRI - magnetic resonance imaging, QED - quantum electrod ynami cs."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"2 V. N. Binhi In this book, we first consider general questions associated with the concept of EMF control of the human organism and particula rly of the human mind. EM mind control is defined. A brief historical overview will be presented showing the significant milestones of the development of this concept in the USA and in Russia. Then known methods that allow extracting information about brain processes are analyzed. Other methods are reviewed as well, which in contrast allow delivery of information into the human brain, by exposure to EM fields and radiations. Any EM mind control should be based on general principles of EMF interaction with living objects. Therefore , also considered are scientific grounds for possible EM mind control. They include (i) a variety of biological effects of weak MFs and EM radiations, and neurological effects among them; (ii) some theoretical grounds that provide examples of molecula r and subcellular mechanisms validating the effects of weak EMFs, and (iii) technical limitations of the targeted exposure of humans to EM fields and radiations. A comment is given to the microwave hearing effect with regard to its potential for EM mind control. Then, there are observat ions, experiments, facts, where the human mind is not only an object but also the subject of a study. Here, the observations may not be explained within the scientific context. Therefore, the limitations of the scientific method are discussed. It is the interaction of human mind with the surrounding reality that is most vulnerable from the viewpoint of its scientific descrip tion. Finally, conclusive remarks focus on what is possible and what is not possible in the EM mind control area. In particular, based on the review of literature made, we deduce which kind of mind reading is scientifically grounded and in what sense we may speak about mind control. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations in 1948 lists basic human rights that should be guaranteed to all people. One of the most important pri nciples declared is \"freedom of conscience\" and closely bound to it fr eedom of thought. It is the freedom of an individual to hold an opinion, viewpoint, or thought without interferen ce, i.e., regardless of anyone else's view (GAUN, 1948). Two important consequences result from these principles. First, it clearly means that everybody has the right to keep his or her thoughts concealed. Would some person or group of persons or an institution find a method of reading another person's mind, it would be a direct violation of the basic law. Some human rights organizati ons consider any interference in consciousness as an inadmissible and illegal act. Second, in addition to the abovementioned social component, the freedom -of­ thought prin ciple also has an implication, although not obvious, related to the"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Introduction 3 scientific view of the world. With a closer look, it becomes clear that the principle embodies thought as a fundamental category adopted by humankind free of direct social responsibility. For exa mple, hatred is non-punishable unless it was expressed as an action resulting in harm. This means, for example, that no one could be prosecuted for his or her thoughts. Thus, people recognize, by their practical activity and by their legislation, that thought by itself cannot produce action or matter. It is significa nt that science relies on the same postulate. A principle of the scientific method is to separate the object from the subject of study and to take the object as that existing regardless of the subject's mental activity. This principle is in excellent agreement with both general scientific observations and everyday experience. The social aspect of the postulate is even more significant than its scientific counterpart because it originates from the historical human experience. The social law transcends science since it not only includes the latter, but also encompasses the entire human practical informal knowledge. Review of the literature on such a complex subject as \"mind control\" requires clarifying the position with regard to the materialist and idealist standpoints. In what follows, we adhere to natural scientific positivism, according to which, in particular, matter exists independe ntly of the thoughts on it, science deals with phenomena, i.e., replicated events, and new knowledge appears as a generalization of empirical data. The particular case where observati ons of mind control are beyond the scope of science will be specifically discussed. MIND CONTROL It is important to come to an agreement about the meaning of the key term \"mind control.\" The notion of mind control and the extent of its possible influence on individuals have not been conclusively determined. The term is rarely used in scientific literature . Usually, mind control is defined as a general term for a number of controversial theories and/or techniques desi gned to subvert an individu al's control of their own thinking , behavior, emotions, or decisions, or to manipulate the consciousness of a person. The feasibility of such control and the methods by which it might be attained are also in dispute. Social psychology sees mind control as a systematic use of well known communication principles. Under this definition, people who persuade or impose their opinion on others, implement mind control to some extent. Evidently, social psychology does not take into account that an individu al's control of their consciousness might be suppressed not only by the"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"4 V. N. Binhi communicative pr ocesses themselves (conversation, reading, TV, mass media, hypnosis, etc.), but also by non-communica tive external causes. This would include different chemicals, which reduce self control biochemica lly (psychotropic drugs, smells), and physical factors like visual perception of light and hearing of sound patterns, temperature influences, and EM field exposures. Of course, these can be used in a variety of combinat ions. In the problem of mind control, two aspects are very different from a physical viewpoint. First, mind reading per se is a method by which one could secretly obtain or read-out information, the thoughts that an individual is thinking . The second aspect is a method of delivering and embedding information to an individual 's mind. Among all types of mind control technologies, the most intriguing is the technology that uses EM fields and radiations as a delivery vehicle for mind control signals. The dilemma is that EM radiation can be easily organized so as to unexpectedly or even secretly expose large group s of people using relatively distant EM sour ces. Or, under certain conditions, EM radiation can be focused on a local target. Electromagnetic mind control may be understo od in a wider sense, as a technology designed to scan the consciousness and to read mind by means of EM radiations. EM mind control implies the following essential and unique features. It is a remote control technology with the ability to cover a potentially large area of exposure and with a capacity for quick adjustments and tar geting. However, the most important feature of EM mind control is the possibility of a covert EM exposure. The exposed individuals would be unaware of the EM influence and would believe that their actions are under their own control. They would be unaware that some of their thoughts could originate from external sources. Sometime s, ultrasonic sounds are considered as a carrier of hidden information for subliminal perception as well as EMFs. However, EMFs have much higher penetrating power. In accordance with the aim of this study, only electromagnetic mind control and mind reading is considered. MIND READING A few of the general relationships between such concepts as words, phrases, thoughts, and senses should be clarified before proceeding with the subject of mind reading."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Introduction 5 One can understand the sense of the following phrase: \"Aoccdmig to a rscheearer at Cmabrigde Uinervti sy, it deosn't mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoatnt tihng is taht the frist and lsat ltteer be in the rghit pclae. The rset can be a taotl mses and you can sitll raed it wouthit porbelm. Tihs is bcuseae the huamn mnid deos not raed ervey lteter by istlef, but the wrod as a wlohe.\" This is a well-known example showing that the general meaning of a sentence may be communicated in many ways. In other words, there are many ways to say the same thing. Even when the words are scrambled in a phrase, the sense of the latter is still understandable to some extent. This demonst rates that a sense is an independent entity that may be expressed by different means. In addition, creative abilities can also communicate senses, for example, the meaning of artwork. Clearly, a sense exists separately from the form of its expression. What kind of thoughts are behind phrases and senses? It is not yet known. The human mind is able to think without expressing senses, or meaning s, in the form of verbal constructions, words or phrases. Even covert speech does not always accompany the flow of senses. Apparently, humans can think silently without covert words, i.e., they think with an \"inner silence,\" and only when they need to actually transfer their thoughts to others, humans can \"switch on\" a special mental translator, which interprets individual senses in common for all words and phrases. This does not, of course, rule out inner speech, when a human speaks covertly. Even in these cases, the speech reflects the interactions between many different senses. It is reasonable to assume that if mind reading existed, it would consist of receiving the flow of senses. To read a person's mind means to know what that person thinks, and a person thinks by senses. But how it is possible? How do we perceive senses, or thoughts, which are not ours? One way is to read previously written text or contemplate an image; another way is to hear what was spoken. It is practically impossible to understand a sense using other organs of sense such as the sense of taste or smell. Some people believe that some kind of sense or thought, that is to say information, may be perceived by a person who is sensitive to paranormal experiences. However it would be an experience inexplicable in scientific terms. It follows that thoughts cannot be read at least until they are spoken, openly or covertly, or expressed in any other way. Usually, thoughts are considered to be propaga ting excitations of neurons in the brain cortex and their interaction. One could hypothesize that knowing which neurons are \"fired\" at a given moment in time would make it possible to understand what the human thinks. As said above, such a technology would have to convert the distribution of fired neurons into the text with a sense, i.e., first, to"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"6 V. N. Binhi explain the pattern of fired neurons in terms of senses and, second, to interpret the obtained sense using words and phrases. That is, this technology, particula rly a comprehensive computer program, would have to replace the brain in its most enigmatic and subtle function, consciousne ss. It seems impossible even within the physicalist framework . At the level of computational and memory power of the modem computers , one could assume that 101 2 is a likely current limit for a fast memory array. The network of 101 0 human brain neurons involves about 101 4 conjunctions, or synapses, that are necessary to create a thought. A 100-fold difference cannot be overcome here by a mere expansion without a qualitative change. Moreover, a major problem would be to produce the \"initial conditions\" necessary for such a system to be able to function as a brain. If this were somehow achieved, electromagnetic mind reading would also be met by severe physical and technical limitations, which are considered below. EM WEAPONS Anything using EM fields or radiation to damage or destroy including damage of normal psychic or social processes can be referred to as an electromagnetic weapon. Among such weapons are known laser and microwave weapons, which were a part of the Strateg ic Defense Initiative (1983). Reviews on EM weapons may be found in many sources, for example (Liebig and others, 1988). Another known type of powerful EM radiators, which might be used as weapons (Falmer, 1995), is related to the project HAARP, or High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (1993). This is a project aimed to control ionospheric pr ocesses, which might alter the performance of communica tion and surveillance systems (Gordon, 1997). Located in the remote area of Alaska, HAARP antennas, 180 components in all, are organized in a so-ca lled phase array antenna (Figure 1 ). It can focus EM power, a few megawatts in the given case, in a relatively small volume of the terrestrial ionosphere and tempora rily modify its physical properties. This power is about a thousand times smaller than that of a mid-size hydroelectric plant. The possible influences on the biosphere are widely debated. A relatively recent concept of non-lethal weapons is aimed at minimizing civilian casualties (Giri, 2004; Kiss, 2005). These are weapons intended to immobilize rather than to kill or to cause great bodily injury to a living target. Electromagnetic non-lethal weapons use EM radiations to cause pain, fear, or similar reactions in personnel, to influence the perceptions and attitud es of"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Introduction 7 individuals and groups, which finally could disrupt military operations. Such technologies are now considered to be useful in civilian operations to suppress violent, unruly or illegal riots and protests. The most commonly known are microwave guns, which produce pain from the microwave emissions that cause sudden heating of the skin of humans. Current knowledge of biologica l effects from short microwave pulses is very limited; underlying biophysical mechanisms are not identified. However, available results of military funded studies (e.g., Pakhomov et al., 2003) on the effect on neuronal functions in rat brain slices are consistent with the concept of heating of the tissue and provide no indication of any specific effects. EM he ating is the only type of EM biologica l effects, so-called EM thermal effects, that are recognized by most of the scientific community. There are also less known nonthermal EM biologica l effects. In these effects, EM fields and radiations do not appreciably heat tissues; however they carry information which is assimila ted at a biophysica l/biochemical level and leads to a biologica l endpoint. It is these effects that constitute a potential scientific ground for mind control. Therefore, also discussed in literature is the possible use of EM microwave s or RF facilities at low powers that cannot produce perceivable reactions like a pain or fear, but nonetheless directly affect the cognitive aspects of an individu al. Externally applied EM fields are thought to be capable of implanting information in an individual 's brain. Because an EM exposure can be ca rried out secretly, such facilities are of ten associated with a special type of electromagnetic weapons by which secret groups or institutions might control minds of people. Some conspiracy theories are known to be based on the existence of such EM facilities. There is a general term for these in Russia: \"psychotronic weapons\". In the most extreme cases, according to conspiracy theorists, even simple innocuous laboratory EM generators became psychotronic generators that could be operated by a criminally motivated individual and change a person's state of mind or behavior. However, sometimes, it is actually hard to distinguish the truth from conspiracy theory. One more aspect of EM mind control is worth mentioning . The fact is that EM mind control as a method of mind reading, let alone mind intrusion, may not be a capability accessible to all levels of society. Assume for a moment that an efficient mind reading technology really exists. If everyone had access to such technology, it would quickly destabilize a society. Knowing precisely what an individual is thinking would allow the possibility of significant power over their personality. This means that EM mind control is a sort of \"ultimate weapon\" that will probably always be associated either with the unique ability of some esoterics or with extremely secret engineering achievements and technological"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"8 V. N. Binhi breakthroughs. In addition to this problem, relating to the society's viability, a variety of ethical implications to the issue of mind control have been considered in (Moreno, 2006). We can see that science, as a method for discovering and using new knowledge, together with moral and et hics are intricately intertwined with each other thus securing a global society 's stability and development. Figure 1. HAARP antennas geometrically ordered to beam the EM power to a given place in the ionosphere ( www .haar p.alaska.edu). NEURO TECHNOLOGIES Can modem science and technology achieve the ability to read and manipulate the mind? We will look at electromagnetic neurotech nologies below. Electromagnetic mind manipulation, unlike mind reading, appears to be a matter of fact. Electromagnetic neurotechnologies are the technologies focused on the central nervous system, in particular the brain, which use EMFs as a necessary intermediate between the brain and technical sensors or other utilities. There are several types of such neurotech nologies: magnetoencephalogr aphy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and transcranial and standard magnetic stimulation of the human brain."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Introduction 9 In magnetic encephalo graphy, the electrical activity of the brain is recorded by an array of small magnetic sensors arranged close to the head of a human (Presissl, 2005). A computer gathers information from the sensors and converts it into 3D (three-dimensi onal) distribution of the brain activity. At this time, the number of sensors can be as many as a few hundre d, which gives an illustration of the hardware resolution, i.e., how many parts within the brain may be resolved with regard to their activity. The 3D distribution of the brain activity is a pattern that changes in time. Millisecond time slices are available to researchers. MRI utilizes another principle to scan the brain. MRI provides information about tissue structure based on the distributions of the chemical or elemental composition. Here, in a small zone of the brain tissue, external EM fields excite atoms so that they begin to irradiate their own EM radiation. This radiation is captured by special detectors . The zone of excitation sequentially travels throughout the brain. Then a computer reconstructs 3D distribution of a given chemical element in the brain. Biophysical structure s, like vessels, bones, soft tissues, etc. have their own chemical compositions, which also change according to their physiologica l state. Therefore, the elemental distributions provide a great deal of information about the structure of the brain and its functions. Spatial and time resolutions of this method are about a millimeter and a millisecond, varying depending on specialization. For example functional MRI (fMRI), focusing on the fast proce sses of brain excitations, offers the best time resolution at the expense of spatial resolution. Interesting results in neurological effects from exposure to EM fields were obtained with the so-called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a technique that applies short pulses of magnetic energy to stimulate nerve cells in the brain (Cowey, 2005). It is used primarily for localizing various brain functions, because the magnetic field in TMS can be focused in a small area of the brain. Utmost non-uniform MFs are used to achieve a better focusing ability. Currently, TMS is not as widespread as MRI, seemingly because the space resolution here is lower. However, TMS can provide greater energy to brain areas to block their natural activity. The method is promising for use in research, diag nosis, and possibly in treatment of epileptic seizures, depression, and other neuro logical and psychiatric disorders. Standard electromagnetic stimulati on, unlike TMS, uses mainly uniform and much weaker magnetic or electric fields. This method is primarily used for fundamental scientific research aimed at determination of the mechani sms underlying electromagnetic reception. The method is used for its simplicity and ease to monitor all parameters of the EM exposure. The method is so widely used that there is no reason to referen ce a special literature; the books (Bersani, 1999;"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"10 V. N. Binhi Binhi, 2002), which present the designs and results of many original studies and provide a unified viewpoint on the nonthermal EM biological effects would be a reasonable choice for introduction to bioelectromagnet ics. SELECTING LITERATURE Criteria used in selecting scientific and non-scientific literature to review were as follows. 2 All available non-scientific documents on the subject of EM mind control were divided into the following groups: (i) articles from military journals, (ii) declassified security documents showing that governmental agencies were funding investigations into EM weapons and mind control, and (iii) newspaper articles. Of course, the newspaper material was not analyzed and was only referenced in a limited number of cases. As to the military articles and documents, since there is no way to be conclusive with regard to such material, comments were avoided whenever possible. Apparently, before a military research program in a given direction could develop, some prerequisites, or prelimina ry scientific knowledge, should exist in order to generate the military concept, on which the resea rch program can be based. For example, before the first nuclear weapon was created in 1944, there was a long period of open scientific research beginning with the discovery of natural radioactivity in 1896 and of atomic nuclear structure in 1911. A more apparent example is the development of the microwave gun that works as crowd control, using a thermal shock. That RF and microwave EM fields can heat biological tissues has been known for many decades. But only now, when different high-tech technologies have been developed, which allow producing nanosecond microwave pulses at hundreds of megawatt power level, has the creation of a microwave weapon become a reality. Military research may contain secret knowledge, or know-how. At the same time, military research deals mainly with technical realizati ons of known scientific concepts.

Obviously, it is the technology or know­ how rather than the scientific concept that usually contains sensitive information that an institution will classify. Therefore , there are many reasons to expect that publicly available scientific literature would contain explicit evidence that EM fields and radiations are capable of controlling the human mind, in principle. However, direct scientific studies on EM mind control have not been found in public journals. Could they be classified? Forman (Forman, 1987) notes that in 1950 s, i.e., during the period of intense studies of nuclear weapons, the cumulative number of papers published in U.S. physics journals was about 50,000. He then surmises that it was probably only some small percentage of the number of security classified reports in physics and its military technical applications prepared in that decade. The present review only covers the development of unclassi fied and related technologies described in publicly available literature. In pri nciple, studies on EM mind control could be based on existing knowledge of (i) brain interaction with EMFs and (ii) nonthermal biological effects of weak EMFs. Therefore, the methods utilizing EMFs in brain research and also literature on biologica l/neurological effects of weak EM fields and radiations were selected and reviewed. In order to gain an objective view on the progress in these directions, original scientific works have been examined with a special focus on EM powers, frequencies, time parameters, neurological parameters measured, and possible applicability to mind control."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Chapter 2 HISTORICAL OVERVIEW A brief historical overview is given below of the research into EM mind control in the USA, former USSR, and Russia. It should be noted that this review is based mainly on newspaper articles and books that do not go through the peer reviewing process usual for scientific literature. The newspaper articles of our interest provide information that hardly may be examined. Therefore , the information below is for orientation in a general way. In some cases, however, open documents have been found, which confirm the statements made in the review. USA History of EM weapons in the USA is known from many open literature sources, for example (Phillips et al., 2006). 3 A number of facts about the history of EM weapons in USA showing plurality of opinions are presented in (Welsh, 2003). Most often are discussed the following military programs within which the use of EM radiations as the factor of damage or control over people's behavior is supposed or documente d. In the 1950 s, a mind control research project named MKULTRA and grown from the previous projects BLUEBIRD and ARTICHOKE (1951-1953) was launched by the CIA. The activity within MKULTRA was concerned with the research and development of chemical, biological, and radiological materials capable of employment in secret operations to control human behavior. There is only a little evidence that the project involved the use of EMF to alter brain 3 The author of the present book (VB) does not necessarily share the opinions given in this report."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"14 V. N. Binhi functioning (Marks, 1979; MKULTRA, 2007). The project continued until the late 1960s at a gradual reduction of financial support. In the 1970s, after the revelation that the CIA had conducted partly illegal experiments on U.S. citizens, the project received negative ethical value. Based on the declassified document (MKULTRA Subproject 119, 1960), one could state that the CIA had some interest in studying activation of human behavior by remote means. However, there is no evidence that any substantial progress has been reached in controlling an individual through EM mind control techniques within the projects. The \"Moscow signal\" discovered in 1960 caused a great concern of the West military structures. The problem was that the power of the \"signal\" was by orders of magnitude lower than the safe level adopted by the EM safety standard in the USA for that frequency range. Nonethele ss, possible health effects from exposure to weak EM microwave s have been taken seriously. In 1965 the Pentagon launched the Project PANDORA, a secret scientific investigation of behavioral and biological effects of microwave s similar to those used for exposure of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. The project involved the CIA, DARPA, the Army and the Navy. The results were not conclusive, little was learned, interest waned, and PANDORA ended in 1970. There is an opinion concerning PANDORA that the military departments of the USA and USSR were diligently playing the disinformation game, at least at the end of this project, and this game could not continue longer (Riebling, 2004). However, it should be emphasized that the inconclusive results were related to EM mind control rather than to the nonthermal biologica l effects from EMFs. The latter have just been developing since then, and we now have vast evidence for such effects, despite the lack of financing due to the discussed opposition by the manufacturers of mobile communication systems and electric appliances. In 1975, WRA IR (Walter Reed Army Institute of Research) and DARPA initiated research into possible use of the so-called microwave auditory effect for wireless voice transfer (Justesen, 1975). Microwave auditory effect is the hearing of short pulses of EM microwaves irradiating the head of a human. The effect is based on non-uniform thermal expansion of living tissues in the skull which generates sound pulses under pulsed microwave s. Since then, the effect has been thoroughly studied (Lin, 2004) and shown to be effective only at rather high microwave powers, which significa ntly reduces its possible application as a clandestine EM mind control technique. Nonetheless, the Air Force Research Laboratory supported the works on microwave hearing that lasted from 1994 to at least 2002. The work within the SBIR Contract F41624-95-C-9007 was conducted under the title \"Communica ting Via the Microwave Auditory Effect\""},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Historical Overview 15 and the results of that work are still classified, which is known from the US Air Force response to a FOIA request dated 1999. Set out in 2005 by several US institutions and supported by DARPA, the project BICA (Biologica lly Inspired Cognitive Architecture s) aimed to combine knowledge of neuroscientists, psychologists, and computer scientists in order to map and engineer the human mind was cancelled (Coughlin, 2007). Also cancelled was a related project, Architecture s for Cognitive Information Processing, which sought to develop special computer hardware. A possible reason for this is not enough progress in this research. It should be noted that according to the latest open information, military departments and agencies as well as security establishments are rather far from any practical realization of EM mind control. Future novelties discussed in this area are limited by those where military personnel could receive commands and monitor equipment via electrodes implanted in their brains (Hoag, 2003); hundreds of electrodes can be implanted. However, EM mind control is also debated (Sazaki et al., 2004). Among the 10 newest weapon technologies (Hecht, 2006), only three are based on beamed EM radiation: high-energy lasers, high-power microwave bombs, and Active Denial System (microwave guns). All three are high-power technologies, and only the latter one, also-called a non-lethal crowd-control weapon, is to affect people. Microwave beams, about 0.1 THz EMF, may typically be irradiated by a one­ to two-meter antenna powered by a generator mounted on a vehicle, in crowd control situations. Human skin absorbs such a radiation within a few seconds, which results in inten se pain. Serious injury is possible if people delay escaping the radiation. Tests have shown that microwave guns, when used in built-up areas, can produce hotspots due to ref lections off the surface of building s, the ground or water. Then peak power may be several times higher than that of the main beam. Obviously, such EM weapon, causing just the avoidance response, has nothing to do with EM mind control that implies a clandestine influence. However, as is easily seen, technically nothing prevents use of the microwave beams at low powers to insensibly affect the human brain to the extent permitted by physical laws. RUSSIA Data on EM weapons in the former USSR and Russia are less available than those in the USA. Information on this may be found in newspapers and on the"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"16 V. N. Binhi Internet. The number of journal articles is limited. Unlike scientific data, information of this sort could hardly be tested for its correct ness. It would require a separate study. Here some facts and short comments based in particular on the book (Kandyb a, 1995) and the personal experience of the author (VB), are presented. In 1853, A. Butlerov, a prominent Russian chemist of the time, put forward a hypothesis that \"neural currents\" of an organism are identical to the electrical currents in conductors and assumed that brains of different humans may communicate via propaga ting signals of electrical nature. Yu. Okhorovich and V. Bekhterev developed this hypothesis m 1877 and 1910-1920s, correspondingly. Bekhterev has established, for the first time in the world, the Institute on Research into Brain and Psychic Activity. In 1913, Prof. V. Pravdich­ Neminsky records the first EEG in a dog (Pravdich-Neminsky, 1913). 4 In 1920, acad. P.P. Lazarev considers an electromagnetic nature of mental influences. In 1923, B. Kazhinskii, a researcher in an academic institution, proposed a device reproducing the EM oscillations similar to natural brain waves, i.e., an \"artificial thought\", and raises the question about distant control on humans, hence, EM weapons (Kazhinskii, 1963). Since 1932, have L. Vassiliev and S. Turlygin continued the studies on mental hypnosis, its physical nature, and the role of EM radiations in it. S. Turlygin assumed that brain waves were EM waves of 1.8-2.1 mm in wavelength ; however, he noted that brain radiation differed from EM radiations in some aspects. In 1959, there appeared the book Mysterious Phenomena of the Human Mind by L. Vassiliev and the newspaper article \"Radiotran smission of Thoughts\" in Komsomolska ya Pravda dated November 15. Technologies for long-distant mental information transfer were studied in the 1960s at The Moscow Scientific and Technical Society for Radioengineering , Electronics and Communication (I. Kogan, V. Kaznacheev) and at The Institute of Automation and Electroener getics, Siberian Division of the USSR Academy of Sciences, Novosibirsk (V. Perov). In 1962, an effect of \"cutaneous vision\" had been registered: R. Kuleshova, suffering from epilepsy, demonstrated her ability to read printed texts by touch balls and to perceive the images enveloped into optically opaque materials (Bongard and Smirnov, 1965a; Bongard and Smirnov, 1965b; Romanovskii, 2004). One of the hypotheses tested was that EM radiations underlay this striking effect. 4 In the U.K., an early work on an electrical activity in animal brain was reported by: CATON, R. (1875) The electric currents of the brain. British Medical Journal, 2, 278. The first EEG in human was recorded in Germany: BERGER, H. (1929) Ober <las Elektroen kephalogramm des Menschen . Archiv fur Psychiatrie und Nervenkrankheiten, 87, 527-570."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Historical Overview 17 In this regard, it is interesting to note that some organisms have regular arrays of photoreceptors on their surface that can serve as an additional optical warning system (Aizenberg et al., 2001). Some humans are able to discern the spectral composi tion of light incident on their skin. The possibility of the human brain to process \"optical\" signals from skin was studied in (Bekhtereva et al., 2002). However, this ability could not be enough to confirm the possibility of cutaneous vision, because a lens is also needed to convert the image to be read into one on the skin for further perception. Not commenting on the scientific merit of those early studies, which were the product of their time, it is important to emphasize their historical value and to pay a tribute to the pioneers of EM neurotechnology. Many research projects into medical applications of RF EMFs and their biological effects were carried out in the USSR in the 1930s in the All-Union Institute of Experimental Medicine and in the State Institute for Physical Therapy. In the 1950s and 1960s, the work to standardize EMFs was under way in research institute s of occupational hygiene and diseases (Moscow, St. Petersburg , Kharkov, Gorky), and in institute s of general and communal hygiene (Kiev, Moscow). The metho dologica l principle of hygienic standardization which was used in the USSR included the following studie s: (a) short-term studies on laboratory animals exposed to high and low-intensity EMFs; (b) long-term experiments with low intensities; and (c) hygienic and clinical-ph ysiologica l investigat ions of the public he alth under respective occupational conditions both on volunteers and with the population in the areas near EMF sources. In the USSR, the first standard, the Provisional Sanitary Rules of Work with Centimeter Wave Generators (no.273-58), was approved and enforced by the Ministry of Public Health of the USSR in 1958. The standard incorporated the standardized levels of EM fields in the frequency range of 300 MHz - 30 GHz, and of 100 kHz -300 MHz for occupational exposures."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"18 V. N. Binhi Figure 2. Experimental stand to study the EMF biological effects in the Occupational Medicine Institute of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences. Comprehensive experiments were staged to justify the permissible EMFs for the general public at the Institute of Occupational Hygiene and Diseases of the Academy of Medical Sciences of the USSR (now the Occupational Medicine Institute , Figure 2) in Moscow; at the All-Union Research Institute of Labor Protection of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions (Leningrad), and at the All-Union Institute of Standardization in Machine Building (Moscow). These general works on EM safety levels have brought out clearly and indisputably that weak EM radiations affect humans and that one of the most vulnerable physiological systems is a nervous system. In the United States, the first national standard of electromagnetic safety in the radio frequency range was issued in 1966 by the U.S. National Institute of Standards (USAS C9 5.l-66). The EM safety levels adopted by the USSR and the USA standards differed by about a thousand. The western standard permitted exposure of humans to much more powerful EM radiations. This indicated the lack of knowledge concerning the theoretical fundamentals of the phenomenon and the difference in scientific approaches to it. This misbalance continues existing even now. Historically, Russia remains one of the central places for studying the nonthermal biological effects of EMFs. For example, the Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Biophysics and the Institute of Cell Biophysics of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Puschino Scientific Center (www.psn.ru/english), study mechanisms of EMF effects on biological systems as"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Historical Overview 19 one of the basic areas of research, and the majority of their publications in this area relate to the nonthermal effects. A powerful impetus for resea rch into biologica l effects of EM radiations was given by the school of N.D. Devyatkov in the former USSR that developed EM microwave generators (the millimeter range) in the 1960s. These works were reproduced abroad. From the very beginning, it became clear that the microwave s had marked biologica l effects (Devyatkov, 1973). Of special interest was the fact that the microwave power was frequently too low to cause an appreciable he ating of tissues. At the same time, a quantum of radiation energy was two orders of magnitude smaller than the characteri stic energy of chemical transformations. Moreover, microwave effects were observable only at selected frequencies, which suggested their nonthermal nature. The effects also depended on low-frequency modulat ions. Thus, researchers obtained a tool with the help of which it became possible to study biologica l effects of the shorter EM waves that had a potential of affecting the human mind. As was discussed in literature, in the 1960s the U.S. embassy in Moscow was being bombarded by low-level microwave EM radiation, with estimated exposures 5-18 μW/cm 2 , see for example (Wade, 1979; Goldsmith, 1997) and the reference to the \"Lilienfeld Report\" therein. It is interesting that the power density of the radiation was a thousand times smaller than the maximum safe exposure level adopted by U.S. safety standards in 1966 (Steneck et al., 1980). Even so, the \"Moscow signal\" has entailed marked worldwide growth of mil itary research into microwave weapons. In 1970, a state commission of scientific experts on mental hypnosis was appointed at the direction of the Secretary of Central Committee of the CPSU. In the 1970s, leading research centers studying brain radiations were located in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Novosibirsk, Minsk, Rostov, Alma-Ata, Gorki, Perm, and Sverdlovsk. In Kiev, technical solutions were developing at the factory \"Arsenal\" ('/. Kandyba) and fundamental questions at the scientific production association \"Otklik\" (S. Sit'ko). The latter was established by a governmental regulation of Council of Ministers of the USSR. Many experiments were conducted with participation of N. Kulagina, who displayed the ability to mentally affect physical measurement instrumenta tion. Many noted scientists in different institutes have repeatedly documented these effects in their studies. Electromagnetic nature of those effects was discussed. Since approximately 1973, the works in this direction have been classified. In 1973, the first installation was constructed and tested, which induced sleep in humans exposed to a microwave EM radiation (radiosleep ). The work was conducted by the Institute of Radioelectronics of the Academy of Sciences of the"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"20 V. N. Binhi USSR and some effective results were reported after experiments made together with a military department. Some conclusions are possible from analyzing the facts about microwave ­ induced sleep. Scientific literature includes only a limited number of such studies, despite their potential significance. Direct EMF-induced sleep has been observed under RF EMF exposure (Subbotina et al., 2004)5 and under ELF EM fields (Ban'kov, 1972; Wang et al., 19 97). Many studies have been conducted in which only indirect influences of EMFs on sleep have been found, see for example (Akerstedt et al., 1999; Borbely et al., 1999; Altpeter et al., 2006). At the same time, a variety of sleep disturbances under EMF exposures are discussed much more often (Mann and Raschke, 2004; Huber et al., 2003; Hung et al., 2007). It is interesting that nothing prevented researchers from changing frequencies, powers, or modulations of the microwave s they used to find those inducing sleep. However, this has not been done evidently. This of course would be done if the effect existed. The only microwave s ina ccessible to civil researchers were high­ power microwave s. Most likely, such EMFs have been examined in the above mentioned semi-military research of radiosleep in 1973. Such microwaves heat a body not only on its surface but also over a significant depth of the organism. This confounds the organism's physiological responses and might cause sleep. Another scenario involves microwave auditory effect, since the information on that research mentioned the microwave -induced acoustic oscillations in the brain; this is possible also only at high powers. At any rate, high-power microwaves are of thermal influence and have a little to do with the subject of this book. There was an approximately 10-year interval during which Kiev coordinating research center \"Otklik\" had been financially secured. Judging from available open literature , the main achievement of this center could be presented by the patent (Sit'ko, 1996). The invention relates to a method of medical treating a series of functional disturbances by ex posure of biologica lly active points to a very weak microwave radiation. There were multiple observations of nonthermal biological effects from microwaves including such effects from noise microwave radiations. No other outstanding results are known. In 1982, the State Institute of Problems of Physics and Technology was established by the Ministry of Instrument Engineering . Judging from the contents of the books published by the Institute , it was engaged in studies of biologica l effects of EM fields and radiations, see for example (Lupichev, 1989). At that time, the author of this book was affiliated with a theoretical department of the Institute and was searching physical mechanisms that could explain biologica l EMF reception. A few collections of works of the Institute , which were published 5 The author of the present book (VB) has managed to find the only publica tion on this subject."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Historical Overview 21 during 1989-2001, show that there was no significa nt insight in the nature of those effects, neither theoretical nor experimental . Now the Institute IS significantly reduced and IS no longer a center for research m bioelectromagnet ics. 6 In 1982, there was established a laboratory for research into the human and organisms radiations. After a few years of intensive research, the results were published reporting no other radiations except those known to modem physics (Gulyaev and Godik, 1983; Gulyaev, et. al., 1984; Godik and Gulyaev, 1991). In 1989, the USSR State Committee on Science and Technology (SCST) issued the Regulation No.724 \"on appointment of the Center of Non­ Conventional Technologies of the SCST USSR.\" This institution was aimed to coordinate research into the so-called \"torsion field\", its theory and practical implicat ions. The existence of such a field followed the idea that all objects that have mass produce a gravitational field, and those having electric charge produce an electromagnetic field. Many elementary particles also have a spin, something like a rotation. Consequently, rotation of matter should allegedly generate a specific field of its own, the torsion field. A great amount of money, approximately hundreds of millions of rubles, 7 was planned to be spent on this program . However, the program has never been started because of the strong opposition of academic establishment and vulnerable position of the Soviet government before the dissolution of the State Union. Later in 1991, the Center was formally disbanded. Actually, it was reformatted into the Inter-branch Scientific and Technical Center for Venture Non-Conventional Technologies (ISTC VENT) with a status of a non-state enterprise. This structure has been receiving minor support from the Military until the dissolution of the USSR and some time after that (Alexandrov and Ginzburg , 1999). In 1996, the International Institute for Theoretical and Applied Physics (IITAP) was established under the aegis of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences, a civil society organization that united many noted scientists (not to be confused with the official Russian Academy of Sciences). The number of workers in the Center and the Institute varied between 3 and 30 depending on the available financial support. The main goal of all these institutions, which were headed by the late Dr. A.E. Akimov, was to investigate into the torsion fields and related technologies. The author (VB) was signed up by the SCST in 1990 and had been working there and then in the daughter institutions until 2000, i.e., for about 10 years. 6 Disbanded in 2008. 7 Late in 1989, that would be about tens of millions dollars."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"22 V. N. Binhi These institutions, particula rly ISTC VENT, are of ten noted on the Internet, in newspapers, books, and popular journals as a leading institution where (i) the so-called psychotronic generators have been developed and (ii) a large amount of research has been deployed into psychotr onics (Tsygankov and Lopatin, 1999). In those notes, far too much attention has been drawn to the fact itself that such studies took place and nothing was said about the results of these studies. However, the results were more disappoi nting than satisfying, at least to the author of the present book, who was one of the top researchers at these institutions. No special physics has been placed behind the generators proposed personally by Akimov. Their interior arrangements were inspired just by intuition. The generators of a few different constructions have been replicated in some dozens of copies; an example of a torsion field generator is shown in Figure 3. They were distributed by A.E. Akimov mainly among researchers in non­ academic institutions to research into possible effects of torsion fields, or more precisely, into possible effects caused by the generators of a given design. Many such studies reported that the generators induced measurable effects in physical, chemical, or biological systems (Zarubin, 2007). However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the academic institutions have found any effects from exposure to the supposed fields of these generators. And no replication academic studies have been organized. As well, there is no reliable information about any industrial production of such generators or about research and development into mind control effects of torsion fields. Generato rs, similar to the aforesaid generators by their declared abilities, are known also from the works of many other inven tors, both in the former Soviet bloc countries and the Russian Federation. For example, the report (Maire and LaMothe, 1975) provides information about such psychotronic generators. However, the description is far from a scientific one. Apparently, torsion fields as an object of experimental study should be completely out of normal science due to the lack of their scientific observati ons. Torsion generators were not a deception of Akimov: he actually believed in what he did. But it was a bright example of pseudoscience. A firm belief instead of doubt, which is a pivotal methodologica l principle, kills science, making fiction instead of making knowledge. In general, torsion fields are known as a mathematical object since Cartan's time. They are related with a geom etric property of space-tim e. The gravitational fields describe the space-time curvature. Similarly, the torsion fields describe another geometric property, the space-time torsion. In standard gravitational field theories, the effects of torsion fields were calculated to be extremely small as"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Historical Overview 23 compared to the gravity: torsion fields should not be observed. However, some novel theories, in particular (Shipov, 1998), predict the opposite; admittedly, the torsion field here is not exactly the same as usual torsion. Figure 3. A \"psychotronic\" generato r. The box of matches in the foreground is a scale element. It is interesting that in this theory, the well-known fundamental fields and their equations emerge as some limiting cases of more general equations, in accordance with the requirement of scientific method. So the theory deserves attention. At the same time, this theory is not without difficulties (Rubakov, 2000). In any case, until the ontological status of the torsion field is clear, one should consider it an unscientific area of study, precisely an area having no connection to the material world. In Shipov (1998), torsion fields are considered to be a \"phy sical basis\" for the paranorm al. Because both torsion fields and paranormal are out of science, nothing prevents acceptance of the statement. Science deals with objective reality, i.e., with the world that exists independently and before any cognizing subject. Out of the scientific worldview, where thing s depend on consciousness, all is possible, at least at first glance, what contradicts scientific observations."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"24 V. N. Binhi However, common sense says science is not the only source of true knowledge. There are many other forms of comprehen sion and cognition beyond science: art, intuition, mysticism, etc. At least as a heuristic conjecture we should admit that science is not omnipotent and hence miracles 8 can happen. Of course, in any case, because of their irregular character, there is no possibility of their practical use. What is interesting is that some people insist that would be possible. Hypothetical weapon technologies based on different paranormal phenomena have been discussed for many decades (Alexander, 1980). This latter article comments on the results of a few unclassi fied studies (actually, it just lists these studies) in a sense that the \"phenomena\" described-t elepathy, precogmtlon, telekinesis, out-of-b ody experience, etc.-are real effects, probably of electromagnetic origin, that could be used for military needs. Referencing the old declassified report (Maire and LaMothe, 1975), Alexander writes: \"The reality of paranormal events has been accepted by Soviet researchers, and theories have been developed to explain and study those events. The Soviets have further developed techniques to control and actively employ their knowledge of parapsychology . . . The amount of information scientifically verified by the Soviets is voluminous\". These categorical statements do not actually reflect the state-of-art. It is, of course, strange that the author could not see a variety of different opinions among former Soviet scientists regarding paranormal studies and their results. The overwhelming majority of researchers would dispute the existence of such effects. This situation has not changed since then and now the Russian Academy of Sciences stands aside from paranormal studies as well as in the past (Ginzburg , 1999). As is discussed below, the reason for this is that the paranormal is out of science by methodological grounds. 8 By definition, miracle is a divine interferen ce into natural laws and human affairs."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 BRAIN CONTROL We will now survey modem neurotech nologies, in which EM fields play a crucial role. Any technology focused on the central nervous system, in particular the brain, is referred to as neurotechnology. Neurotechnology approaches are often classified into a few general categor ies: invasive versus noninvasive or passive imaging versus active manipulat ion. Neurote chnologies may be viewed either as a real-time technique, directly displaying neural pr ocesses, or as a technique , averaging and storing incoming signals for future use. Averaging over time or space implies collecting useful information to exceed a noise level. With regard to EM mind control, naturally, we will only consider the noninvasive methods with a little attention to the time character, bearing in mind the terms \"brain reading\" or \"brain mapping\" for passive imaging and \"brain stimulation\" for active manipulat ion. Therefore , the following methods and technologies will be addressed: magnetic resonance imaging , magnetoencephalogr aphy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, standard magnetic stimulation, microwave auditory effect, and brain-machine interface. The latter neurotechnology may be thought of as a noninvasive method in the future. We will not consider positron emission tomography (PET), a medical technique, which also produces 3D images of functional processes in the human body, since their use is based on introducing radioactive chemicals into the body.

It produces high quality images of the inside of"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"26 V. N. Binhi the human body. There are a variety of modem MRI devices produced by different manufacturers (see Figure 4). MRI is based on the physics of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Figure 4. Typical MRI scanner. The bed lifts a human, and then the slider moves the body through the magnet. The basic principles of NMR are those of a spin motion. Substance consists of atoms. Any atom has an electronic shell and a nucleus. Some nuclei having at least one unpaired constituent subparticle (proton or neutron) have a magnetic moment, like a compass needle. In a de MF, nuclear magnetic moments behave like spinning tops in the gravity field, i.e., they precess. The frequency of precession, proportional to the de MF strength, is called NMR frequency. When an additional ac MF of that frequency excites the magnetic moments they begin to emit a RF EM radiation. The MFs of other frequencies cannot cause the moments to emit. Therefore , this effect is a resonance, hence NMR. A basic description of the physics that MRI scanners utilize, is as follows. The de MF slightly changes over the scanned ob ject. Consequently, at the NMR frequency of the ac MF, the resonance conditions are fulf illed just in a small area of the object, usually a narrow nonplanar slice of it. Weak RF radiation emitted"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Brain Control 27 by the nuclei of this slice is picked up by a special coil antenna and passed to a computer. Then the de MF changes so that the resonance conditions are fulfilled within the next neighboring slice. After scanning the object in three directions, a computer program reconstructs a 3D distribution (MRI images) of the radiation emitted by the nuclei (Figure 5). The more the density of atoms and molecules carrying the emitting sort of nuclei, the more the radiation intensity is. Actually, modem devices are based on more complex protocols with repetitive trains of radiofrequency MF pulses. The resonance frequency of a magnetic nucleus is sensitive to the presence of other magnetic nuclei in its vicinity, because the latter generates additional MFs around them. A special type of MRI called \"magnetic resonance spectroscopy\" is based on this effect and is capable of noncontactly detecting biochemica l molecules that contain many specifically arranged nuclei. Not all magnetic nuclei are suitable for MRI. It can only be performed on naturally abundant nuclei. Most widely used are hydrogen nuclei 1 H which are present in water molecules H 2 0 and in most other biologica lly significa nt molecules. Also used in MRI studies are 1 3 C, 1 4 N, 19F, 2 3 Na, 3 1P, 1 2 9Xe, and others. The distributions of these elements over tissues bring much information. However, their content in the human body is not high. For example, the number of sodium atoms is less than that of hydr ogen atoms by a factor of about 1500. The wide practical use of 1 H MRI is explained by the large concentration of 1 H nuclei in living tissues, which secures a high signal-to-noise ratio of the output signal and consequently a good resolution. A better resolution is possible with use of special contrasting agents introduced into the human tissues. The MRI signal quality depends on the so­ called spin-lattice, or longitudinal, or T 1 , relaxation time: the shorter the time, the higher the rate of the repetitions of RF MF pulses may be chosen. This allows accumula ting the useful signal on the background of thermal noise; hence the quality of the signal becomes better. Contrasting agents shorten the relaxation time. Usually, contrasting agents are molecules that carry the paramagnetic gadolinium ion. It has relatively large magnetic moment 7.6 μB that produces a rather high nonuniform MF around it, about 10 mT at a distance of 1 nm (10 A). Thermal perturbations randomly change the field direction. In such a field, the precession of nuclear spins quickly loses its regular character, which means the shortening of spin relaxation time and increasing of the output signal quality."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"28 V.

To detect fast changes in an organ, like those in brain areas during their functioning at cognition, quick scans are needed. However, it is clear that the faster the scan the worse the resolution. The only way to improve the resolution is to increase the de MF magnitude, since the radiation intensity of nuclei rapidly, as the fourth power, grows with the MF strength . Therefore, strong magnetic fields, usually of a few Tesla in magnitud e,9 are used in functional MRI studies. Time resolution in such devices is in the order of seconds and less and spatial resolution is about 1 mm and less. For these reasons, fMRI has become very popular in brain research: signals from local brain regions may be collected within milliseconds, which is enough to study their specific functions. 9 Such fields are called strong fields because they are million times greater than the level of the natural geomagnetic field, about 50 μT."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"30 V. N. Binhi Two of the most powerful fMRI machines working at 9.4 T are at the University of Illinois (Chicago) and at the University of Minnesota. The weight of their magnets is hundreds of tons. Probably, wide use of such machines will be limited by their high cost and possible health problems for patients. Though there are no immedia te side effects from MRI scanning (Schenck, 2005), opinions on its long-term health consequences are diverse (McCann et al., 1998; Ikehata et al., 1999; Takashima et al., 2004; Miyakoshi, 2006). It is reported that these new MRI machines can track brain neurons. But this is a metaphor. Since the number of neurons in a human brain is about 1011, to track a single neuron in such a multitude of neurons would require resolution on about 0.01 mm that is now impossible. Evidently, it is brain areas bound with neurons rather than the neurons them selves that could be tracked. At the same time, brain mapping can provide much information. Even if only n= 12 parts of the brain are being monitored with regard to their activity, and only two possible states of each, activated or not activated, are taken into account, there is as many as exp(2n/3 )hr, i.e., about a thousand possible brain states that could be distinguished. Since the resolution of brain mapping technique is somewhat higher and it increases constantly, the perspective of brain mapping is great. If it were not for ethical reasons, it could find numerous practical applications besides medicine. However, there are severe physical constraints for MRI applications other than scientific or medical screening s. For example, brain-mapping devices set in airports could screen passengers' brain patterns to detect those typical to terrorists (Pasternak, 2000). But we should remember that modem MRI devices use strong static magnetic fields of the order of Tesla and mainly take minutes to scan a human head in a fixed position. The stronger the magnetic field and the longer the time of signal accumula tion, the better the resolution. Even at that, it needs to remove all metal thing s and to dispose the head in close proximity to the apparatus. All this makes it hopeless to scan a brain without a person being informed and specially prepared. But if individuals knew about the fact of screening , who knows what kind of thoughts they would prepare for a brain reading machine? The physical constraints indicated (strong MF, order-of -minute scanning time, immobilized object) are of principle character; these could not be overcome in the course of technical improvemen ts."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Brain Control Figure 7. An advanced laser magnetometer will probably be a complem entary tool for brain studies. 31 However, one new magnetometry method is developing, with no need for a strong MF (Savukov et al., 2006). Partially supported by DARPA, the method is promising for MRI-like scanning (Savukov et al., 2005) (Figure 7). It also could make scans distantly, as it uses laser beams for gathering information. But this technique now is in its infancy. Another new imaging approach can do MRI not using a strong MF: the geomagnetic field is sufficient. It uses superconducting sensors to measure the spatial distribution of the pre-pola rized and so emitting nuclear spins (Zotev et al., 2008). The space resolution of this imaging system is about 3 mm; however, it takes hours to scan a brain. Even with these advanced high-tech solutions, it would not be possible to read thoughts in the direct sense. What is possible now is only to distinguish between pre-given thoughts or senses. With regard to EM mind control, we are interested in the sense of thoughts rather than in their locations in neurons or any"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"32 V. N. Binhi other space-time ordering . Apparently, senses are distributed between many neurons, and will remain inaccessible for screening by the scientific methods for a long time. In this regard, interesting insights into the possibility to determine what others see or think, by means of fMRI, were recently published in the leading scientific journals, Nature and Science. In (Kay et al., 2008), the authors first recorded fMRI scans of two persons while they were looking at different photographs showing animals, building s, food, etc. There were a total of 1750 photographs and corresponding dynamical images. A special computer program called \"brain model\" was calibrated using those photographs and images. Then, the persons looked at another 120 photographs while being scanned by fMRI. After that, researchers were able to determine, with accuracy of about seven to nine hits per ten tries, which one of these new photographs each person had been looking at, based on just their fMRI scans treated by that computer model. They suggest that it is, in principle, possible to reconstruct the visual content of personal dreams and imagery from measurements of brain activity alone. Figure 8.

It has been demonst rated that they could correctly determine the noun, from the list of 60 nouns, that a subject was thinking , three out of four times. There are limitations: verbs cannot yet be identified, nor can the context of the thoughts be determined. However, the work has shown that there is a commonality in how different people's brains represent the same ob jects, which is promising for further exploratory studies. Apparently, some simple thoughts, linked with perception, that can be mapped out in the brain space, could be deciphering in principle. But complex thoughts linked with cognition of the meaning of statements would be impossible to get hold of without such a powerful \"computer\" as the human brain . Though reading thoughts may still be science fiction, there is a joke that MRI stands not for \"Magnetic Resonance Imaging ,\" but rather for \"Mind Reading Interface.\" l\\fAGNE TOENCEPHALOG RAPHY Magneto encepha lography, or MEG, has its starting point in the so-called SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) technique. SQUID enables one to measure MFs as small as of the order of 10-15 T. It is billions of times less than the natural geomagnetic field, about 5 x 10-5 T, and thousands of times less than the level of geomagnetic fluctuati ons. Electrically active nerves in the brain produce MFs some three orders higher than the SQUID limit, which makes measurements of their magnetic fields possible. Usually, the magnetic activity of a brain is recorded by an array of SQUIDs arranged in many points, or channels, within the special helmet on the head (Hamalainen et al., 1993). This makes it possible to reconstruct 3D distribution of electric currents of brain activity. The signals from SQUIDs are recorded by a computerized data acquisition system and pr ocessed by the so-called source localization techniques. It is software algorithms to disentangle contributi ons of various active brain areas in the signals. Then the data are displayed, and may be interpreted by trained personnel. Compared to EEG, MEG has higher resolution and sensitivity. The most advanced system has 510 SQUIDs and up to 306 MEG channels at 5 kHz sampling rate (Figure 8). At present, MEG is regarded as the most efficient and sophisticated method for tracking brain activity in real-time. When focusing on the highest resolution, complica tions of interpreting MEG data are encountered that relate to the necessity of knowing the anatomical"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"34 V. N. Binhi peculiarities of an individual 's head (Knosche et al., 2005). This requires the combination of MEG with other mapping methods, like MRI or NMR (Volegov et al., 2004). In general, the source localization technique is model-based and is an ambiguous procedure . This sets a natural limit on the accuracy of the computed spatial distribution of the brain activity (Lutkenhoner, 2003). However, this does not prevent MEG analysis of brain activity associated with hand movements (Takahashi et al., 2004), human syntax processing (Kubota et al., 2003; Halgren et al., 2002), audio pitch processing (Krumbholz et al., 2003; Lutkenhoner et al., 2006), exposure to visual and auditory stimuli (Sokolov et al., 2004), and others (Knosche et al., 2005). Apparently, the MEG technique is presently close to the ability of discerning between preselected mental activities caused by stimuli of different nature. It is very interesting that MEG patterns allow detecting neural responses associated with linguistic modifications of phrase structure. At the same time, no indications have been found in scientific literature that one could determine, by MEG, different thoughts or intentions of an individual which were not selected in advance. Hence, in this manner, no mind reading in its direct sense is possible yet. It should be noted also that spatial resolution and sensitivity of MEG crucially depends on the close proximity of the SQUID sensors to the human head. Simple physical constraints dictate no MEG would be possible at a distance greaterthan about 0.5-1 m. The report (Pinneo and Hall, 1975) is sometime cited to support the possibility of mind reading by EEG analysis. It was shown that EEG responses for covert speech mimic those of overt speech for the same subject, electrode and spoken word. Since thoughts accompanied by covert speech are known to induce muscle activity somewhat similar to that of the overt speech, principal possibility exists of detecting such thoughts by analyzing EEG patterns. The authors of the above referenced work had no journal publications following the report; so we might guess that they had failed to realize their idea at that time. However, now, with rapid development of accurate physical measurements, the idea is reviving . NASA scientists have learned to detect silent reading using nerve signals in the throat that control covert speech. In prelimina ry experim ents, small sensors placed on the neck could convert nerve signals and transmit information to a computer, which translated the signals into words with a special program (Bluck, 2004). On the other hand, some simple parameters of the covert speech and human vision are now detectable by fMRI, as is studied in (Huang et al., 2007; Kamitani and Tong, 2006). One might assume that a combination of these two techniques could bring something similar to mind reading.

Figure 9. The electromagnet generate s pulses of magnetic field, which induce eddy electric currents spatially localized in a small region of the brain. TRANSCR ANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION Transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, as described by its name, is a stimulation of the brain tissues by external magnetic fields from outside the cranium . It is a simple and inexpensive method that allows selective influence on the brain regions During the TMS procedure , an MF inductor is placed beside the cranium, practically on the head surface. The inductor is connected to the source of electric current pulses and consequently generate s the pulses of MF. MF passes through the skin and cranium into the brain without distortions, because all these tissues are diamagnet ic. Then, MF pulses induce closed electric currents (eddy currents) During TMS, an electromagnet, or inductor, is positioned close to the skull (Figure 9). The inductor is energized by a pulsed electric current, which generates a magnetic pulse. The MF gets into the brain through the skull freely, without being distorted. Pulses of the MF induce closed electric currents (eddy currents)"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"36 V. N. Binhi in the brain tissue under the inductor. The position of the inductor determines areas where the maximum of the current density takes place. In these areas, the induced electric field depolarizes neuron membranes and thus changes the passage of neural signals. In other words, here the electric current can \"fire\" or block neurons. In this way, it is possible to excite or, in opposite, suppress the activity of different brain regions and activate or block certain mind functions. For example, one can cause a human to \"see\" light flashes without light actually entering the eyes (phosphenes) with magnetic stimulation of the visual cortex in the occipital lobe. Electric pulses induced in the motor cortex are accompanied by corre sponding involunta ry muscle contract ions. The stimulation of the prefrontal cortex responsible for thinking causes unconscious changes in memory and mood, in the level of attention and anxiety, and in other cognitive functions. An advantage of TMS in comparison with other methods of brain activation is in that this method does not involve implanted electrodes. No surface electrical contacts with the surface of the head are needed to interfere with human brain functions, as well. At the same time, spatial resolution of this method is not high as compared to MRI. However, in some cases, researchers could achieve the resolution about 1 mm, reducing the pulse intensity to a value a little above the motor threshold. Usually, special figure-8 -shaped loop inductors , of a few centimeters in size, are used. As compared to ordinary ring-shaped inductors, 8-shaped inductors generate more nonuniform MF and so have better focusing on a given brain area. The MF under the inductors is a highly non-uniform single or repetitive MF pulse of about 0.1-0.2 ms duration and of a few teslas in magnitude. The induced electric field pulses in the brain are of the order of 100 V /m, which is enough to trigger action potentials of underlying cortical neurons. There is anecdotal evidence that MF pulses with magnitude as small as of the order of pT also affect human brain functions (Anninos et al., 2006), but these results cannot be explained in scientific terms. In some cases, large ring-shaped inductors or even the Helmholtz exposure systems are used for stimulation of the deep brain areas to lower depression levels in some patients. However, this type of stimulation, in fact, makes no relation to TMS, because it lacks the basic characteri stic feature of TMS, locality of the action. By (i) stimulating different cortex areas and (ii) recording caused reactions, one can map the functional brain activity and study the functions of these areas depending on experimental conditions. Unlike fMRI and MEG, TMS can only provide two-dimensiona l scalp maps of the associative links to be analyzed,"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Brain Control 37 because the electric currents induced by an MF pulse reach a maximum just near the cranium . The best magnetic focusing is achieved for the brain regions close to the inductor, i.e., for the cerebral cortex. It is a wrinkled 2-4 mm layer on the brain surface under the cranium that plays a key role in many brain functions. Among them are attention, perception, thinking , and consciousn ess. TMS­ modulation of cortical processes is used to evaluate memory, language, vision, sensory-motor functions, etc. (Devlin and Watkins, 2007; Kluger and Triggs, 2007). Mapping of the brain with use of TMS is of highest time resolution. It enables one to study the speed of nerve pulse propagation in var ious body systems at neuropat hology. Simultaneous or time-shifted stimulation of different cortex areas makes it possible to study local neur ochemica l abnormalit ies. Different brain regions are known to be interdependent: suppression of the brain activity in one region can cause activation of another region. This allows regulating some brain functions changing the activity in those areas that are accessible to TMS. At present, TMS is examined as a method of treatment of psychic abnormalities due to an organic lesion, i.e., various neuropsychia tric disorders (Wassermann et al., 2008). The potential use of TMS is also discussed for treatment of individuals suffering from brain functional disorders like epilepsy, depression, attention deficit, and migraine (Fregni et al., 2005; Clarke et al., 2006). There are two types of TMS: one using single pulses and one using repetitive pulse trains. At that, the rate of pulse repetition is in the range of about 1-10 Hz, the pulse train dura tion is 1-10 s, and the session duration is 5 to 30 minutes. In case of long-lasting sessions, appreciable aftereffects appear which depends on the stimulation parameters : the localization of action, the inte nsity and repetition rate of pulses, and the session duration. This important fact is used to develop effective protocols for the treatment of the above mentioned diseases. In addition, modulating the excitability of cortical areas, TMS permits study of the mechanisms of those diseases that usually cause the similar changes. It is known that TMS by repetitive pulses results in the sensation of discomfort or slight pain and is capable of initiating seizures. Therefore , the questions of safety at TMS, including possible remote consequences, are in the scope of attention of both scientists and state institutions. Use of TMS devices in definite conditions and with definite purposes is regulated by corresponding bodies, for example, by FDA in the U.S., and remains under the control of institutional commissions on the ethics in science. The possibility of noninvasive excitation and suppression of cerebral cortex areas is a new method in neuro science research (Cowey, 2005; Kobayashi and"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"38 V. N. Binhi Pascual-Leone, 2003; Verdon et al., 2004). The method has been developing since the 1980s (Barker et al., 1985; Ueno et al., 1988 ), and there are no obvious reasons why it had not been used before. The potential of scientific, diagnostic, and therapeutic applications of TMS is particula rly wide and continues growing at the expense of combined usa ge with other methods of functional diagnostic s. TMS is a technique that implies positioning of a magnetic inductor directly on the head. Therefore, it is impossible to remotely control mind in this manner. STANDARD MAGNETIC STIMULATION In order to distinguish a general type of magnetic stimulation that significantly differs from those relatively complex magnetic stimulati ons that were described above, a term \"standard magnetic stimulation\" is used below. With the standard magnetic stimulati on, a brain is exposed to a uniform MF, the source of which, usually a Helmholtz pair of coils, is greater in size than the head. With this type of stimulation, all parts of the brain are exposed to the same MF so that no mapping information is possible. Standard stimulation is used mainly in scientific purposes focused on the general effects of EMFs on biologica l systems. In these effects, the fundamental mechanisms underlying biomagnetic reception are of primary interest. Since the fundamental mechanisms are associated with the properties of yet unknown targets for the MF in a biologica l tissue, and such targets are assumed to be of molecular or subcellular size, the position of these targets in the brain or in other tissues is immaterial . Then, the use of uniform MFs, which are easily controllable, is justified. In that way, standard magnetic stimulation enables a researcher to eliminate a possible independent factor of biologica l influence, the magnitude of the heterogeneity of EMFs that could affect organisms in its own way. As well, standard stimulation can simulate well the natural electromagnetic conditions featured by the sources of EM fields and radiations that are relatively far from humans. At the same time, providing rich information about molecular and chemical processes under EM exposure in general, standard magnetic stimulation gives nothing like a space distribution of those processes. The information appears to be space-averaged. The laboratory systems of the standard magnetic exposure are usually from half-a-meter to a meter in size. Sometimes, larger systems are used, like that"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Brain Control 39 shown in Figure 10, when a whole-body EM exposure m a non-magnetic environment is preferred. It should be noted that standard magnetic stimulation is the only type of brain magnetic stimulation that can be organized as a remote noncontiguous influence. The exposure system in this case should not necessarily be the Helmholtz-like system of coils: it may be designed as a lengthy wired construct. MICROWAVE AUDITORY EFFECT The microwave auditory phenomenon, or the microwave hearing effect, first observed in 1940s (Elder and Chou, 2003), is the hearing of short pulses of EM microwave s incident on the head of a human or an animal (Frey, 1961; Guy et al., 1975; Lin, 1978). For exa mple, single 10-μs pulses of 2.45 GHz microwave energy may be heard as clicks at rather high peak powers corresponding to energy flux densities above 4 W/cm 2 or at SAR of greater than 1.6 kW/kg (Lin, 2004b). A series of pulses can be heard as an au dible tone at a frequency corresponding to that of the pulse repetition rate. The more the power, the louder the clicks are. It is clear, therefore , that, depending on the modulation signal, modulated microwave s were found to produce sounds, which seemed to emanate from within the head (Justesen, 1975). This latter work indicates that with the pulse-rate modulation it was possible to transmit even some words; however, it has never been verified in scientific literature . In (Justesen, 1975), the level 10 mW/cm 2 of a mean microwave power density is cited as a threshold for this effect, and the work (Guy et al., 19 75) gives 100 times less value for he aring of separate clicks and \"chirps\". It essentially depends on the microwave or RF pulse paramete rs. One would think the auditory effect might be used in communicat ions. However a high power, which is necessa ry to cause it, makes it hazardous to one's health. Even if a signal with audio quality as low as within the band 500 Hz modulates the repetition rate of microwave pulses with the above paramete rs, the average microwave energy flux density is about 20 mW/cm 2 . It is high enough to cause heating of the head structures and it exceeds known human safety standards (ICNIRP , 1998). Exposure to such microwave s may be dangerous to human health: it is known to be accompanied by dizziness, headache s, and other long­ term effects (Belyaev, 2005). There is a note on the Internet that research by NASA in the 1970s showed microwave he aring occurs even at low power density, however neither the power level nor the source of information has been provided."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"40 V. N. Binhi Figure 10. Studies in General Physics Institute RAS. Standard magnetic stimulation by weak MFs and electric fields alters cognitive functions (Binhi and Sarimov, 2008). An important result of numerous theoretical and experimental studies of the microwave auditory effect (Lin, 1990) consists in the following. The effect does not arise from an interacti on of microwave s directly with the auditory nerves or neurons of the CNS. Being absorbed by soft tissues in the head, the microwave pulses initiate thermoelastic waves of acoustic pressure that travel to the inner ear where they excite cochlear receptors , as usual sound waves do. According to the review (Elder and Chou, 2003) effective frequencies for the effect range from 2.4 MHz to 10 GHz, and the fundamental frequency of the induced sounds is independent of the EMF frequency and dependent upon head dimensions and individual particula rities. For these reasons, it is hardly possible to transfer words or phrases to the brain in this way. Obviously, physical reasons prevent generation of sounds with wide spectrum, which severely impedes brain identification of words or voice recognition.

BRAIN WAVE MONITORING A number of patents are usually referenced by those who insist microwave hearing may be used for EM mind control. Another modality for impla nting information into the human mind was connected with a widespread but rather naive idea that mind activity may be exhaustively characterized by the brain electrical activity observed, for example, by EEG in the form of so-called brain waves. Accordingly, as was assumed, electric stimulation of the brain by modulated signals similar to brain waves could transfer information into the mind. Some patents, which are often cited, should be investigated now with a focus on the extent of their consistency, either with physics or with the subject of this study. There is a huge amount of ill-founded speculations around the mind control theme. It is often that irrelevant information is presented to readers as conclusive evidence for this or that the sis.

Descripti ons of these documents are available at http://patft.uspto.gov/. Table 1 contains the numbers of the patents, their titles, and brief comments. It is interesting to comment on a few other patents with more deta ils. USP395 l134 \"Apparatus and method for remotely monitoring and altering brain waves\". A method for remotely monitoring \"brain waves\" is suggested. High frequency, of the order of 100 MHz, transmitters radiate EM energy that is directed to the brain of a test subject. The radiated signals of different frequencies penetrate the skull of the subject and mix in the brain to yield an interference wave. In this way, the power of the wave may be focused on a desired area of the brain. Then, two signals, transmitted simultaneously, combine in the brain to form a resultant wave of frequency equal to the difference in frequencies of the incident signals, which enables one to separate it effectively . This interference wave is assumed to be modulated by radiations from the brain's natural electrical activity. Then, the modulated interference wave is re-transmitted by the brain and received by an antenna at a remote station. After it is demodulated and processed, it provides a profile of the subject's \"brain waves\". However, this idea suffers several serious physical flaws: (i) the wavelength of a 100-MHz wave is about 1 m, in the order of magnitude, which is far not enough to focus on a certain place in the brain; (ii) to produce the reflected signal at the difference frequency, brain tissue has to have nonlinear impedance, which is possible only at EM powers far exceeding thermal threshold; and (iii) natural electrical activity of the brain, if measured in the same units as the incident waves, is many orders lower than the natural noise of these incident waves: attempt to extract the brain signal from the reflected wave is hopeless. The author has no works indexed by the PubMed database, which indicates failure of this project.

According to the patent, many video display terminals, when displaying pulsed images with frequencies near 0.5 or 2.4 Hz, emit pulsed EM fields sufficient to cause a sensory reaction of the skin; it is therefore possible to manipulate the nervous system of a subject by pulsing images displayed on a nearby monitor. The method is based on the statement that \"Physiological effects have been observed in a human subject in response to stimulation of the skin with weak electromagnetic fields that are pulsed with certain frequencies\". No convincing evidence for this has been given by the author. Despite a biologica l effect from exposure to a weak EM field of those frequencies could be real, its informational charge is poorly compared with that of the images displayed, so one could hardly speak of EMC. If the effect existed, it would be much easier to generate such a weak EM field without any VDTs. USP4858612 \"Hearing device\". It is hypothesized that the mammalian brain generates and uses EM microwave s as an integral part of the functioning of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Based on this, it is assumed further that"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Brain Control 45 simulating the microwave radiation which is allegedly produced by the auditory cortex, and introducing these simulated brain waves into the region of the auditory cortex, could provide for intelligible sounds recognition. It should be stressed that completely speculative character of this suggestion is based only on anecdotal evidence (Bise, 1978). USP395 l134 \"Apparatus and method for remotely monitoring and altering brain waves\". In this proposal, EMFs are beamed to the brain of a subject in which they are modulated by the subject's brain waves and re-transmitted by the brain to a receiver. If this method were real, it would provide the information similar to EEG or MEG, at best. However, it is absolutely hopeless for technical reasons. The author has not addressed the physics of the processes of RF absorption, reflection and interference, nor the level of the brain generated EMFs. Any signal-to-noise analysis would immediately disclose physical inconsistency of this proposal. USP5935054 \"Magnetic excitation of sensory resonances\". The nervous system of a subject is suggested to be influenced by a weak externally applied magnetic field with a frequency near 0.5 Hz that can excite the known physiologica l effect causing a somnolence. Within the framework of thermal-like mechanisms, a 0.5-Hz MF could cause a physiological reaction just at rather high amplitudes, when the MF induce eddy currents comparable with natural biocurrents in their density. This is a milliTesla level that significa ntly exceeds known safety standards and may be applied only as a medical treatment under strict professional control. At the same time, we know that nonthermal mechanisms of biologica l effects from MFs are not prohibited by physics, and these mechanisms may explain biologica l effects of slowly varying MFs of the order of 100-200 nT. However, such effects are seldom observed and even in this case would have no relation to mind control, at least not the effect the patent claims. There are also patents that have clear and reasonable implication concerning the subject of mind control. USP4877027 \"Hearing system\" (1989). It is supposed that high frequency EM radiation is projected to the head of a human being and the EM radiation is modulated to create signals that can be discerned regardless of the hearing ability of the person. Sound is suggested to be induced in the head of a person due to the microwave hearing effect. The microwave radiation is in the range 0.1-10 GHz, below about 3 mW/cm 2 in mean power density, and presents a series of bursts. The rate of bursts is modulated by the audio input to create the sensation of hearing in the person whose head is irradiated."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"46 V. N. Binhi USP6587729 \"Apparatus for audibly communica ting speech using the radio frequency hearing effect\" (2003), in which a special modulating signal is claimed. The modulating signal is the result of a frequency cut-off and a nonlinear distortion of the initial audio signal. This is to make the demodulation due to RF hearing effect intellig ible. One could see that a number of the above patents, cited by specialized mind control sites, are mostly irrelevant or not suitable for realizing EM mind control. The technical feasibility of a few relevant patents/met hods remains undecided. As was said above, there are physical constraints significa ntly impeding voice recognition through the RF auditory effect. However, the patents preceding and following the USP4877027 are common in that they claim a specific type of the microwave modulation that would secure not only the hearing effect but voice recognition through hearing effect as well. Unfortunately, there are still no published scientific articles validating this way of communicat ion. The authors are not in PubMed. The only indication is that corresponding military research is classified. However, this would not be a crucial argument for the existence of such mind control technology . BRAIN-MACHINE INTERFACE Implanted electronics can give a significant impetus to the development of EM mind control, because special microdevices can be embedded directly into the brain. After the first works on electric brain stimulation by implanted electrodes (Delgado, 1952), many studies have shown that behavior of experimental animals can be changed in a controllable way. Using incentive signals applied to different brain areas through electrodes, the researchers can train animals to perform certain tasks. The level of complexity of reactions increases with the number of electrodes. Now it can be of approximately several hundred or more. The possibilities related to direct communication between the brain and an outer controlling system are discussed as \"brain-machine interface\" (Hoag, 2003; Lebedev and Nicolelis, 2006). They are also referred to as \"brain-computer interface,\" because a computer is usually needed to process the electrical signals between the brain and \"machine.\" With this type of EM mind control, there is no necessity of positioning sensors and inductors close to the brain. The current level of micro- and nanoelectr onics allows wireless neural data acquisition chips as small as 2 mm for a few hundred neural channels (Olsson and Wise, 2005). The same microelectrode arrays can be used both for reading brain signals from many"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Brain Control 47 neurons and for stimulating these by outer commands (Nam et al., 2006; Hofmann, et al., 2006). A difficulty is that invasive neurochips are prone to initiate the process of scar-tissue formation around them, because the organism reacts to a foreign object in the brain. This causes the signal trunsduction between the chip and neurons to become weaker with time or stop completely. However, rapid growth of nanotech nologies in different areas makes it possible to produce bioelectrodes, having enhanced biocompa tible features. Microarrays of hundreds of electrodes with sizes in the micrometer range is a fact now as well. Nanotechnology is crucial here to minimize weight and power consumption of the array integrated electronic circuits. At present, microelectrode arrays, desi gned to be implanted into the cerebral cortex and in peripheral nerves, provide means for improving injured visual, auditory, and motor systems. It has been shown that the spatial organization of sensorimotor areas in the brain cortex can be changed in response to training . The term \"brain plasticity\" is used for this brain ability of neuronal reorganizati on. Brain plasticity provides the condition, in which a person with the implanted neurochip can be trained to control information coming from the outer world. For example, a neurochip implanted into the visual cortex of a human brain and a digital camera connected to the chip formed a system of artificial vision (Dobelle, 2000). Researchers consider the possibility of \"bioskin,\" a material with embedded receptors that will provide tactile sense. Neurochips can also convert a personal will, or mental effort, into electrical signals controlling biomecha nical prostheses. In such cases, the term \"neuroprosthet ics\" is used. Neuropro sthetics is aimed at restoring sight, hearing, movement, and some cognitive functions. For example, monkeys could learn to directly, without moving their limbs, control the movements of an artificial arm by using a brain-machine interface driven by approximately one hundred cortical neurons (Lebedev et al., 2008). A paralytic could use neural control through a microelectrode array implanted in the primary motor cortex to perform simple actions with a prosthetic hand (Hochberg et al., 2006). From the viewpoint of mind control, most interesting would be noninvasive brain-machine interfaces. Known for today are those that use EEG, MEG, and fMRI as methods to acquire primary information from the neurons. In the latter case, it was even possible to arrange a game similar to ping-pong that two trained persons could play in real time using just the power of their minds (Peplow, 2004). Though these possibilities are interesting by themselves, they all require"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"48 V. N. Binhi practically contact interaction with a subject and, therefore, could not be used for remote monitoring of a human mind. Evidently, EM mind control via implantable nanoelectr onics is not the EM mind control in its direct sense. Since it requires brain surgery, it is impossible to think about implantable transceivers in a human brain, except for some obvious cases of medical illnesses and abnormalit ies. In the future, the growth of the quantity of implanta ble nanosensors, their biocompa tibility, and of the power of computers and information processing may provide a new quality resulting in technological effects that we cannot imagine now."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 EXPERIMENTAL GROUNDS FOR EM MIND CONTROL Are there physical grounds to assume that EM mind control is possible? As was said above, any EM mind control should be based on general principles of EMF interaction with living ob jects. Mankind relatively recently began to use EM communication technologies in so dense a way. Therefore , the long-term consequences of such a Janus-like progress are not yet known. Researchers have not had enough time to empirically observe the possible chronic EM effects. This partly deprecia tes the significance of any negative EM epidemiologica l studies. Laboratory studies regarding nonthermal biologica l effects arising from exposure to weak EM fields are difficult to replicate . However, this does not necessarily mean the absence or insignificance of those effects. For example, many epidemiologica l studies examined a possible cancer risk from the background EM fields of power frequency. Some of them revealed a correlation between the rate of childhood leukemia incidence and exposure to power-frequency MF of a few hundred nT (Ahlborn et al., 2001). This made the Internati onal Agency for Research on Cancer classify magnetic fields as a possible carcinogen to humans. The nature of the processes underlying this association remains unclear. Many social, ethical, and health problems arisen around nonthermal EM biological effects are discussed in (Slesin, 2007). Bioelectromagnetics and magneto biology are fields of great social significance. Recent list of books devoted to bioelectromagnetics include approximately 40 publications (Berg, 2004), and the body of papers amounts to a few tens of thousands."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"50 V. N. Binhi The power and frequency of electromagnetic waves are similar to the brightness and color of the optical radiation that human eyes discern. The eye sees the world colored, not gray. There is a great deal of scientific evidence that points to the \"color perception\" of the electromagnetic waves by the human body. This means that EM fields of close but different frequencies can cause different effects in organisms. The nature of such effects, called \"nonthermal effects\", is absolutely different than in the opposite case of thermal effects. Thermal effects originate from he ating of tissues by the absorbed EM radiation. Nonthermal effects can occur at exposure levels that exclude any appreciable he ating; experimental and theoretical grounds for the nonthermal effects are considered below. There is a controversy among scientists on the possible role of the non thermal EM effects in human life because they are difficult to replicate in independent laboratory studies. Why don't we observe those effects always and everywhere in laborator ies? Many reasons have been discussed in literature . Primarily, it is non­ reproducibility of the physical conditions of the EM exposure and physiologica l conditions of the organisms tested. It is also a relatively small magnitude of the nonthermal effects in general. Observation of a stable 10% nonthermal EM effect in a laboratory study is mo stly considered to be a rare case of luck; greater effects are also known. Probably, 1 % is what would be reasonable to expect here. But it would actually be very problematic to detect a 1 % effect in any biological study, given the great variance inherent to biological and epidemiological studies. Yet, such EM effects, being real, can entail great social consequences. EM fields may be less evident but not less insidious than smoking. The EM safety standards proposed by WHO and different national institutions may vary more than 100-fold, depending on the frequency range. The strict standards adopted in Russia are based on the observed biologica l effects under chronic EM exposures, while the most EM safety standards in the world are based on calculated thermal effects. It indicates the lack of theoretical knowledge in this area. Indeed, there is no recognized physical theory of the EM nonthermal effects. At the same time, there is a great body of evidence in laboratory experim ents. In biology and biophysics of non-ionizing radiations, low-frequency magnetic fields of the order of the geomagnetic field, about 50 μT, and microwave radiations below 0.1-1 mW/cm 2 are usually called weak EMFs because they do not cause biologica lly significant heating of biological tissues. There are many works in scientific literature reviewing biological effects of such EMFs (e .g., Binhi, 2002; Volpe, 2003; Belyaev, 2005). However, they are not"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Experimental Grounds for EM Mind Control 51 considered here. Instead, what will be addressed are the effects caused by the EMFs of even much lower intensitie s. A body of experimental evidence is gradually taking shape that testifies to biological activity of superweak MFs, lesser than 1 μT. The mean intensity of an ac MF in those observations is much lower than the level of a loca l de field. Such experiments form a sep arate group because mechanisms for biological effectiveness of superweak fields seem to be different from those for the action of fields at the geomagnetic level and higher. The physical nature of biological effects from EM microwa ves below thermal level, about 0.1 mW/cm 2 , is also unknown at this time. Particula rly paradoxical are effects of superweak EMFs with power density less than 1 μ W/cm 2 . ELFMFs Earlier experimental evidence for the biologica l detection of superweak variable magnetic signals, up to 1 nT, is given in (Presman, 1970). Changes in peroxidase activity in leukocytes of peripheral blood in rabbits upon a 3-h exposure to superweak MFs of 8 Hz were observed in (Vladimirskii et al., 1971). In these experiments MF strengths were 0.02, 0.2, 1, and 2 nT. At all of these field values, they observed changes in cytochemical activity of neutrophiles as compared with controls. The changes varied from about 9±2 % at 0.02 nT to 72±23 % at 2 nT. The authors believe that this could bear witness to living systems being directly affected by geomagnetic storms. Delgado et al. studied changes in morphologica l parameters of chicken embryo growth upon a 48-h exposure to pulsed MFs (Delgado, et. al., 19 82). The body of evidence is insufficient to construct amplitude or frequency spectra; however a statistically significant effectiveness of regimes 0 .12 μ T 100 Hz and 1000 Hz has been shown. Chick embryos were exposed in (Juuti lainen, et. al., 1987) to sinusoidal 50 Hz MF during their first 2 days of development. The percentage of abnormal embryos was statistically significant, about 30% at 1.2 and 1.7 μT MFs, approximately twice as that in the sham-ex posed control groups. In the study (Liburdy et al., 19 93) authors investigated whether a 60 Hz MF can act on cancer cells. The results showed that ac MFs can enhance breast cancer cell proliferation by blocking melatonin's natural oncostatic action. The effect had a threshold between 200 and 1200 nT. This data was confirmed in (Ishido et al., 2001) and challenged in (Dees et al., 19 96)."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"52 V. N. Binhi (Rea et al., 1991) reported that 16 humans they had studied showed a sufficient sensitivity to an EMF to sense the switching on of a weak MF. Volunteers were exposed to an inhomogeneous MF, which varied from 2.9 μT in the region of their feet to 0.35 μT near their knees, and to 70 μT near their heads. The influence of a 0.05-5 Hz, 100-nT sine -wave field on the pulsed activity of neurons in a mouse cerebellum section was observed in (Agadzhanian and Vlasova, 1992). The assays were conducted in a chamber shielded from external magnetic interferences. Kato et al. (1994) determined the action of a circula rly polarized 50-Hz, 1-μT MF on the level of nocturnal melatonin density in mouse blood. Controls were animals placed in a similar exposure chamber with a residual field of less than 20 nT. By the end of a six-week exposure in both chambers, melatonin density was in controls 81.3± 4.0 pg/ml, and in ex posed groups 64.7±4.2 pg/ml. This difference disappeared when measurements were made a week after the exposure. Obviously, division into control and case groups here is fairly conditional, since exposure in fields of such a low intensity is in itself not ind ifferent to anim als. In any case, however, the studies have demonst rated the effectiveness of fields at a level of 1 μT. The work of Novikov (1996) and Fesenko et al. (1997) are devoted to investigations into the molecula r polycondensa tion reaction of some amino acids in solutions exposed to a vari able MF of about 20 nT parallel to a local de MF of about the geomagnetic field. The MF had a frequency of several hertz, which corresponded to characteri stic cyclotron frequencies of amino acid molecules. The very fact of MF being effective at such a low level was shown quite convincingly. There is evidence on the confirmation of those interesting assays in independent laboratories (Pazur, 2004; Comisso et al., 2006; Alberto et al., 2008). Blank and Soo (1996) determined the sensitivity limit for the activity of Na,K-ATPase enzyme in a medium with microsomes in relation to power­ frequency MFs. The sensitivity level was 200-300 nT. It was found in (West et al., 1996) that when a JB6 cell culture of mouse epidermis was exposed for several days to a 60-Hz, 1-μT MF against the background of a static laboratory MF, the number of cells grew by a factor of 1.2-2.4 as compared with controls. Akerstedt et al. (1999) studied the effect of nocturnal exposure to a 50-Hz, 1- μT MF on various physiological characteri stics of human sleep (with 18 volunteers). They found that such an MF drastically curtailed the so-called slow sleep phase. It was found in (Harland and Liburdy, 1997; Harland et al., 19 99) that a 60- Hz, 0.28-1.7 μT MF suppressed the inhibitory action of melatonin and tamoxifen."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Experimental Grounds for EM Mind Control 53 Melatonin at a physiologica l conc entration 10-9 M and tamoxifen at a pharmacologica l conc entration 10- 7 M were used to inhibit the growth of MCF-7 cancer cells in humans. The evidence was of importance since it pointed to a potential hazard of even very weak fields, and so the research was reproduced in another laboratory by other workers (see Blackman et al., 2001). In all the cases, the results appeared to be the same with inhibitory effects declining in a statistically significa nt manner by tens of percent. The effect of exposure to combined ac MF 100 nT and de MF 65 μ T at 3-10 Hz on the production of tumor necrosis factor in macropha ges of mice with experimental tumors was studied in (Novoselova et al., 2001). It was found that exposure of mice to the MF enhanced the adaptive response of the organism to the onset of tumor growth: the production of tumor necrosis factor in macropha ges of exposed mice was higher than that in unexposed mice. The results (St-Pierre and Persinger, 2003) suggested that complex MFs with temporal parameters corre sponding to that of normal biochemical processes, can permanently alter the development of the rat brain. The brains of adult ra ts, exposed prenatally to MFs between 30 nT and 180 nT, exhibited significant anomalous organizations of cells within the hippocampal formation. Female Lewis rats were ex posed in (Persinger, 2000) to weak, 7-Hz MFs with a computer-generated waveform , whose amplitude varied from 15 to 60 nT every 6 to 12 sec. The MF was presented for 6 min every hour overnight. The rats exposed to the MF, against sham controls, displayed statistically significant 55% suppression of the sy mptoms of experimental allergic encephalomyeliti s. The effect was frequency dependent (Cook and Persinger, 2000). Seized rats were continuously exposed to a frequency-modulated MF of 7 to 500 nT in (McKay and Persinger, 2006). After 14 days of exposure, the rats exhibited markedly slower response durations than rats in controls. Effect of whole-body MF exposure on the glucose and cortisol hormone levels in Guinea pigs was studied in (Zare et al., 2005). Thirty six Guinea pigs were exposed to sinusoida l 5-Hz 13 nT and 50-Hz 207 nT MF, 2 and 4 h/day during 5 days. MF exposure under 207 nT caused 30-50% decrease in the level of the hormones atp<0.05.

A body of observational evidence was great even before the 1980s (Dubrov, 1978). Here we discuss briefly more recent findings. Magnetic storms are the disturbances of the Earth 's magnetosphere caused by solar flares, i.e., enormous eruptions of plasma from the Sun's visible surface. The mechanism of magnetic storm formation involves many cosmic and terrestrial phenomena. The Earth generate s its own magnetic field-the geomagnetic field-that declines from the magnetic poles to the magnetic equator from about 70 to 40 μT, the geomagnetic field vector in the north hemisphere pointing down. It is widely accepted that it is a result of hydrodynamic flow within the Earth 's liquid core. 56600 60 B (nT) 56400 40 20 56200 0 56000 -20 55800 0 6 12 18 24 Time (hour) Figure 11.

The geomagnetic field forms the magnetosphere, a complex system of electromagnetic fields and charged particles including the solar wind, which is mostly a flux of protons and electrons. The magnetosphere is compressed by the solar wind on the diurnal side and ext ended on the nocturnal side. Therefore , the geomagnetic field experiences diurnal variations, normally about a few tens of nanoteslas. At the same time, the solar wind is subject to random fluctuati ons due to the solar flares and so the magnetosphere reacts to the flares by abrupt and relatively strong variations, of the order of hundreds of nanoteslas, called magnetic storms (Figure 11 ). Some medical researchers and practicing physicians warn that magnetic storms may be dangerous for those afflicted with cardiovascular illnesses and for"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Experimental Grounds for EM Mind Control 55 healthy people too. Regular geomagnetic activity forecast is being published by many Russian newspapers and in broadcasting as well. Surprisingly, the nature of the correlation between magnetic storms and biologica l observables is not clear. Magnetic storms are single random events; they have unique time-course changes of their paramete rs. Therefore, they cannot be exactly reproduced. However, what is well reproduced is a correlative association between the magnetic parameters of the storms and different biological measurable quantities. Associations have been observed with human biorhythms (Chemukh et al., 1982), morphine analgesia in mice (Ossenkopp et al., 19 83), DNA-related biochemi stry (Vogl et al., 19 91; Hoffmann et al., 1991), EEG mapping (Ruhenstroth -Bauer, et. al., 19 93) and EEG spectra (Schienle et al., 2001), capillary blood flow (Gurfinkel et al., 1995), functional status of the human brain (Belisheva et al., 1995), memory and attention in humans (Tambiev et al., 19 95), morphofunctional status of cell cultures (Belisheva and Popov, 1995), pigeon homing (Domfeldt, 1996), melatonin production (Rapoport et al., 1997), arterial blood pressure in humans (Ghione et al., 1998) and hemodynamic index in rabbits (Gmitrov and Ohkubo, 1999), baroreflex sensitivity (Gmitrov, 1999), heart rate variability (Otsuka et al., 2000; Oinuma et al., 2002; Delyukov et al., 2001), cardiovascular parameters (Stoupel, 2002; Dimitrova et al., 2004b; Dimitrova et al., 2004a; Gmitrov and Ohkubo, 2002; Gurfinkel et al., 1998), motivation (Starbuck, et. al., 2002), suicide rate (Ashkaliev et al., 19 95; Gordon and Berk, 2003), rate of development of schizophrenia (Kay, 2004), blood cell counts (Dasso et al., 2004), psychic activity (Booth et al., 2005), metabolism in rat tissue (Podkovkin and Gribkova, 2005), myocardial infarctions and sudden death (Villoresi et al., 19 95, Rapoport et al., 2006), etc. A thorough discussion of the quality of the methods used and the coherence of the structure behind these studies seems to be right. However, this would not be relevant, for the book has other purposes. Therefore , merely listing these studies, we should emphasize an exceptional diversity of the biological processes that correlate with geomagnetic disturbances. This suggests that the geomagnetic field is invisibly involved into the life of the biosphere. Particula rly dramatic is the correlative link between geomagnetic storms and social phenomena like money emissions (Chibrikin et al., 19 95a), criminal activity (Chibrikin et al., 1995b ), and the probability of air crashes (Sizov et al., 1997). These point out the hypothetical possibility of a large-scale MF control on social processes by virtue of slight but specially organized magnetic disturbances. Recent reviews analyze many other observations. The functional status of the human organism under the geomagnetic variations is discussed in (Oraevskii et al., 1998), perceptual and motor skills in (Houtkooper et al., 1999), the"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"56 V.

It should be emphasiz ed: what is actually observed in the days of magnetic storms is that some measurable characteri stics are changed. It may be psychoph ysiologica l characteri stics of a human organism or behavioral characteri stics in groups of people. The correlative link between these observable characteri stics and geomagnetic storms does not necessarily mean that slow variations in MF during geomagnetic disturbances can directly affect organisms. There could be other factors, like radon concentration, infralow-fre quency sounds, static electric fields, etc., reviewed in (Binhi, 2002), and the microwave radiation of the ionosphere (A vakyan, 2005), which also change in the days of magnetic storms. Such changes could also in tum cause biological reactions. At present, the direct magnetic effect remains a hypothesis; however, many laboratory investigations do support it (Agadzhanian and Vlasova, 1992; Kashulin and Pershakov, 1995; Ruhenstroth -Bauer et al., 1994; Tiasto et al., 1995; Dupont et al., 2004; Del Seppia et al., 2006; Persinger et al., 2005) and also does a correlation analysis (Mikulecky and Michalkova, 2003). Some contradictory data is known as well (Schnabel et al., 2003). Another, though also indirect, evidence that very small quasistatic MFs are capable of significa ntly affecting organisms is the established fact of the so-called magnetic navigation. Many migratory birds and other animals annually travel thousands of miles and accurately find the locations of their seasonal habitats. The reason for this is not completely understo od in spite of the established involvement of terrestrial magneti sm (Kirschvink et al., 2001). In the case of birds, known explanations involve either incorporation of naturally grown nanoscale crystals of magnetic mineral, magnetite fe 3 Q 4 , in a bir d's brain or scull (Walker et al., 2002; Wiltschko and Wiltschko, 2005), or magnetosensitive chemical reactions in a bird 's eyes (Ritz et al., 2004; Johnsen and Lohmann, 2005). In both cases, to navigate a bird needs to percept infinitesimal changes of the geomagnetic field vector components, which are closely bound to the Earth surface in a large scale. Perceptible changes should be about 100 nT and even orders less (Binhi, 2006). In this regard, we should stress that magnetic nanopart icles have also been found in the human brain (Kirschvink et al., 19 92; Dobson, 2002) and other organs.

The effect was nonlinear, i.e., it did not occur at the EMFs of greater powers, 2 and 5 mW/cm 2 . What is important is that modulating signal alone, as an electric field as weak as 10 V /m, but not 100 V /m, was also effective. Often cited work (Bise, 1978) reports that cw mode EMFs 10- 6 nW/cm 2 at several frequencies within the range 130 to 960 MHz caused marked changes in the EEG patterns and in behavior characteri stics. The antenna was a 1 m wire rod monopole placed 1 m from the head. This was a pilot study that tested 10 human subjects only. The study contained methodologica lly imp erfect ideas like the existence of interference patterns from standing wave s within the skull. Many people were excited about the apparent possibility of mind control, and many patents have appeared suggesting a variety of technical implementations for this idea, unfortunately without due scientific backgrou nd. The results (Bise, 1978) have never been replicated anywhere else. 1 0 However, the fact itself that extremely weak RF EMFs are capable of affecting biology has found a few confirmat ions. In some works, biologica l effects of EM microwave s of very small intensity were observed. The possible effects of RF radiation, TV and FM-radio broadcasting frequency range, at power densities between approximately 0.2 μ W/cm 2 and 1 μ W/cm 2 on prenatal development in mice has been investigated in (Magras and Xenos, 1997). Newborns were collected, measured, and examined macro- and microscopi cally. Some association between RF radiation and infertility and developmental parameters was discussed. Based on the available epidemiologica l studies, the so-called \"Moscow study\" and community studies in the vicinity of large FM and TV broadcasting facilities, a conclusion was made in (Goldsmith, 1997) that there seems to be some evidence that ex posures as low as 2 μ W/cm 2 may have long-term health effects. To be unbiased, we should note that according to (Wade, 1979), those epidemiologica l studies were inconclusive. In (Pyrp asopoulou et al., 2004), GSM-like pulsed RF microwave s, with a pulse length of 20 ms and a pulse repetition rate of 50 Hz, at a frequency of 10 All known publication s of W.L.

The power flux was 5 μ W/cm 2 . The results suggested that the EM radiation interfered with gene expression during early gestation and led to aberrations in a protein expression. It is shown in (Gapeyev et al., 1996), that low-intensity electromagnetic radiation of extremely high frequency 41.8-42.05 GHz in near field zone modifies the activity of mouse peritoneal neutrophils on a resonance-like manner. 10% effect at 41.95 GHz was observed at 1 μ W/cm 2 and 5% at 70 n W/cm 2 . In (Novoselova et al., 2004), it was observed the effect ofrepeated treatment with weak microwaves 8.15-18 GHz, 1 μW/cm 2 , 1.5 h daily on production of tumor necr osis factor in macropha ges and T lymphocytes of healthy and tumor­ bearing mice. Prolonged treatment of mice to MW decreased tumor growth rate and increased overall animal longevity. It was demonst rated in (Agafonova et al., 1998) that ex posure of living insects labeled with radioactive phosphorus 3 2 P to 42.2-GHz microwave radiation with energy flux density 0.5 μ W/cm 2 changed the rate of 3 2 P accumulation in the insects' antennas. The maximum effect was about 200%, and it took only about 2- min of exposure. An influence of a pulse-mod ulated 915-MHz RF EMF of power density 10 μ W/cm 2 and modulation frequencies 2 to 20 Hz on the deamination activity of the enzyme monoamine oxidase in rat brain has been shown in (Dolgacheva et al., 2000). 10-min exposure of the rats resulted in maximally 160% effect observed in the brain preparat ions. Production of cataracts in the bovine eye lens was observed in (Aarholt et al., 1988) under exposure to 55 MHz, 10 nW/cm 2 EM radiation. Irradiation experiments (Grundler and Kaiser, 1992) with growing yeast cells during two generations resulted in the following. The cell growth rate depended on frequency in the studied range 41.689-41.707 GHz and either increased or decreased by 10-20% in a resonance-like manner. The shape of the resonance curve depended on the radiation intensitie s: the width of the resonances grew with the inten sities. This indicated a molecular origin of the effect observed. The lowest effective power flux was 5 p W/cm 2 . The resonance effect of 51.755 GHz EM microwave s on the conformational state of genom in E.coli cells persisted at the attenuation of the microwave power flux to 10- 6 pW/cm 2 at a few MHz bandwidth (Belyaev et al., 19 96). Yeast culture S. cerevisiae was exposed to 7. 1-mm microwaves within a wide range of powers in (Kuznetsov et al., 19 97). There was a response that consisted in the emergence in a synchronous cell culture of a proliferation process, such that the temporal dependence of the density looked like a step function. Such a"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"60 V. N. Binhi response appeared some time t after the beginning of the ex posure, and that time depended on the microwave power. The dependence was close to a linear one (from power log arithm) within t=5 min at 1 m W/cm 2 and t=240 min at 10- 6 p W/cm 2 . The power density of the thermal EM radiation by a living tissue over a MHz bandwidth at physiological temperature is about 10-1 2 W/cm 2 , i.e., a picowatt per squared centimeter. In this regard, observati ons of biologica l effects at power densities of the order of 10- 6 pW/cm 2 should be associated with a paradox. There are also many other works devoted to nonthermal biologica l effects of EM fields and radiations, reviewed in (Hyland, 2000; Belyaev, 2005), which adjoin the discussed observations of biological ef ficacy of superweak fields and radiations. In these works, a variety of biologica l effects were observed under the exposure to laboratory RFs within the inte nsity range 1 to 100 μ W/cm 2 or to mobile phone radiations at low energy flux densities that could not heat biological tissues. In (Koldaev, 1987) the results of almost 20-year studies in the field of acute microwave effects on different living objects and tissues were reported. In these studies, mostly microwaves of near thermal energy flux density have been used. Despite the fact that such radiations may cause heating of biological tissues, the author concluded that besides thermal effects there is also a nonthermal one that could not be explained by heating. The physical nature of biologica l effects of weak variable MFs (about the geomagnetic one) remains unclear. We should hold the same conclusion about nonthermal biological effects of RF EMFs. In this regard, experimental data on biological reception of MFs many orders of magnitude weaker than the geomagnetic field, look of course, quite challenging . Biological effects of pT MFs and of pW/cm 2 RF EMFs, where they are confirmed by independent laborato ries, present a paradox that is still awaiting its solution. The body of that evidence is not large so far, but knowledge is being gleaned. NEUR OLOG ICAL EFFECTS OF EMFS Neurological effects of ELF MFs and RF EMFs have been studied for decades. There are many reviews on this subject, both relatively old (Lai, 1992; Lai, 1994) and recent (Cook et al., 2002, Sienkiewicz et al., 2005). Many reviews devoted to neurological effects of RF EMF s may be found in special issues of the jo urnal Bioelectromagnetics, Volume 24, Issue S6 and Volume 26, Issue S7."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Experimental Grounds for EM Mind Control 61 The brain and nervous systems are considered particula rly vulnerable to EMFs because their functioning is based on transfer of nerve impulses, which involve electrical processes within and in between nerve cell membra nes. Many laboratory animal and human studies have been conducted to investigate the possible effects of weak EMFs on the nervous system including cognitive , neurobehavioral and neuroendocrine functions. Neurobehavioural studies, reviewed in (Sienkiewicz et al., 2005), include the effects of the direct stimulation of nerves and nerve tissues, and the effects on CNS functions. A recent review of the research into EMF effects on brain tissues, starting from pioneering works by W.R. Adey, is given in (Blackman, 2006). The effects are shown to feature amplitude and frequency selectivity, hence it is nonthermal effects. Neurological effects of the EMFs have been repeatedly reviewed by many institutions: National Research Councils, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (U.S.), International Agency for Research on Cancer, Internati onal Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, WHO and others. In general, there are many different field-induced responses. Some of them are well established; others are small in magnitude and inconclusive. Most studies investigating cognitive function and brain activity under acute exposure to EMFs were conducted to determine possible physiological or behavioral impairment, or health effects. In general, the available evidence is not sufficient to draw a clear conclusion. However, the existence of a variety of neurological effects from EMFs is indubita ble. In view of many reviews, which describe EM neurological effects in details, we will just indicate those of the effects that are caused by relatively weak MFs: (Rea et al., 19 91; Agadzhanian and Vlasova, 1992; Akerstedt et al., 19 99; McKay and Persinger, 2006; Keeton et al., 1974; Ruhenstroth-Bauer et al., 1993; Schienle et al., 2001; Belisheva et al., 1995; Tambiev et al., 19 95; Dornfeldt, 1996; Starbuck et al., 2002; Ashkaliev et al., 1995; Gordon and Berk, 2003; Kay, 2004; Booth et al., 2005; Chibrikin et al., 1995b ). General information about these works is given above. It is interesting that most neurological effects of weak fields have been observed in the low-frequency range."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Chapter 5 CAN SUPERWE AK EM FIELDS AFFEC T ORGANISMS? The nature of biologica l effects of weak electromagnetic fields remains unclear, despite numerous experimental data. The difficulty in explaining these effects is usually associated with the fact that an energy quantum of the low­ frequency EMF is essentially less than the characteri stic energy of a chemical conversion, about dozens of kT, where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature. It is generally recognized that this fact reveals a paradox and even allegedly proves the impossibility of magnetobiologica l effects. This problem is known in the literature as the kT problem. For the first time, the kT problem seems to have been formulated in the 1960s, in the broad sense, with respect to the biological effects of EM microwa ves. At that time, millimeter waves were discovered to cause different biologica l effects at rather small energy flux densities of the order of 0.1 mW/cm 2 , well below the thermal limit (Devyatkov, 1973). Though the energy quantum of such EM fields was 1-3 orders lower than kT, some physical mechanisms have been developed that take into account collective excitations in biological structure s (Frohlich, 1968; Pokorny and Wu, 1998). Particula rly effective were modulated microwa ves, with a modulating signal in the low frequency range (Bawin et al., 19 73). Later, it was found that the modulating signal itself, as a weak magnetic field signal, can affect the state of an organism appreciably (Liboff et al., 1984). Since then, a body of evidence has been accumulated showing that weak static and low frequency MFs cause a variety of biologica l effects (Volpe, 2003). The kT paradox is especially dramatic in such cases of low-frequency fields, as their energy quantum was 11 to 12 orders of magnitude less than kT."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"64 V. N. Binhi We will consider the kT problem with regard to the EMFs of low frequency. Unlike RF or microwave fields, here there are no technical difficult ies related to the non-uniform absorption or reflection. Then consideration of the interaction between low-frequency EMFs and biological targets becomes particula rly clear. We will specify that the MFs in question, in the low-frequency range from units to hundreds of hertz, are below the level of the geomagnetic field and do not cause any essential inductive heating. They still can cause biologica l effects; the effects are often called \"magnet obiologica l effects.\" Historically the first nonthermal concept of biologica l effects from exposure to weak EMFs appeared in (Liboff, 1985). This concept was focused on the similarity of biologica lly effective frequencies of magnetic exposures and the cyclotron frequencies of biologica lly relevant ions. Many hypothetical mechani sms of biologica l effects of weak extremely-lo w-frequency MFs have been suggested since then. A brief review of the mechanisms may be found in (Berg, 1999; Binhi and Savin, 2003) and the detailed examination in (Binhi, 2002). Most researchers often discuss the following hypothetical physical targets for MF action in magnetobiological phenomena: (i) iron-bea ring magnetic nanopart icles growing in biologica l tissues, (ii) spin-correlated radical pairs, in some biochemical reactions, interacting with magnetic field by their spin magnetic moments, and (iii) long-lived rotational states of some ions and molecules inside protein structure s, which interact with MF by their orbital magnetic moments. The basic problem is that the interaction energy of biologica lly active molecules in the MFs at the level of the geomagnetic field Hgeo is very small. It is by many orders of magnitude smaller than the energy of thermal fluctuations kT ;:::; 4x 10-1 4 erg at physiologica l temperature s: μH « kT, where μ is the molecular magnetic moment. Obviously, magnetic effects cannot exist here! It is the essence of the most heated arguments raised by the opponents of the idea that weak MFs, of the order of the geomagnetic field and lesser, can affect organisms (Binhi, 2007). At the same time, there are an ever-growing number of experimental observations that demonstrate biologica l effects of weak and superweak MFs and require attentive and careful theoretical study. Apparently, to explain observed biological effects of weak magnetic fields one needs to equalize the inequality μH « kT: either the magnetic moment μ of a suggested target in an organism should be sufficiently large, or the effective temperature T of the target should be sufficiently small. The former possibility is used in the mechanisms based on magnetic nanopart icles (Kirschvink and Gould, 1981) found in tissues of many organisms including the human brain tissues (Kirschvink et al., 1992; Mikhaylova et al., 2005). Magnetic energy of such"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Can Superweak EM Fields Affect Organisms? 65 particles may exceed kT by many times and cause a biological response. In a recent work (Binhi and Chemavskii, 2005), as small MFs as of 200 nT were shown to significa ntly change nonlinear stochastic dynamics of the particles. On the other hand, the above inequality relies on the implicit assumption that a target is in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding medium. Evidently, one could overcome the kT problem also having found possible targets whose effective temperature differs from that of the medium, so that the inequality would no longer be valid. Hence, no fundamental limitations would be placed on the possibility of observing biologica l effects of weak MFs that interact with such targets. Reactions involving free radical pairs give a clear example of the case where the inequality fails. Magnetic processes based on spin dynamics of the radicals develop so quickly that the thermodynamic equilibrium has no time to be established. This means spins move coherently and no tempera ture of spins exists within these small time intervals. Another example where the inequality fails is the molecula r gyroscope model (Binhi and Savin, 2002). In this model, a small biologica lly active molecule bound within a protein cavity is well isolated from the surrounding thermal perturbations. Interacting with the MF, it can coherently rotate for a long time. This makes the notion of tempera ture inapplicable to this type of molecula r targets as well. To look at the kT problem more closely, it clearly contains three implicit assumption s: (i) primary magnetoreception occurs at the atomic or molecula r level, (ii) the interaction of an ac MF and a molecula r target is a single-quantum process, and (iii) the interaction of the field and the target occurs under thermal equilibrium conditions. However, an analysis made in (Binhi and Rubin, 2007) shows that these postulates are not completely correct: (i) besides molecular targets, relatively large particles with almost macr oscopic magnetic moment may be found in organisms. As regards molecula r targets, (ii) their interaction with a low-frequency magnetic field is of multiple-quantum character and (iii) may develop in the absence of thermal equilibrium . SUBMICRON LEVEL OF MAGNETORE CEPTION In many organisms, magnetic nanoscale particles consisting of magnetite crystals were found. Magnetic moment μ of these particles exceeds the elementary one by 7-9 orders. The energy of their tum in the weak magnetic field H is significantly greater than the energy of thermal fluctuati ons kT."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"66 V. N. Binhi Of particular interest are magnetite particles found in brain tissues of many animals and humans (Figure 13). They proved to have a biogenic origin, i.e., they form as a direct result of the crystallization in brain matter. Particles of biogenic magnetite are often called \"magneto somes.\" The content of magneto somes in a human brain is about 10 6 -108 crystals per gram (Kirschvink et al., 19 92) and about 50 ng/g on average (Dobson, 2002). A natural limitation on the MF magnitude capable to affect biochemical system through magneto somes is about 1-2 μT. However, as was shown in (Binhi and Chemavskii, 2005), the biologica lly detectable level of the MF may be even tenfold less if magneto somes rotate in double-well energy potential . Figure 13. Magnetic nanoparti cle, about 40 nm in size, extracted from human brain. Adapted from photography in (Kirsch vink et al., 19 92). As proved today, such effects as precise orientation of many biological species during their seasonal migrations are based on the MF interaction with magneto somes (Walker et al., 2002) and their nonlinear stochastic dynamics may be a mechanism underlying the phenomenon of biological reception of MF variations as small as the geomagnetic variations, of the order of a hundred nanoteslas (Binhi, 2006)."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Can Superweak EM Fields Affect Organisms? 67 The magnetic nanoparticles have either natural biogenic ongm from intracellular ferritin or appear in cells due to exogenous contamination by widely spread iron oxide nanopart icles. The MF produced by magneto somes is rather intensive and is of the order of 0.1 T in the vicinity of the magnetosome surface. This is thousands of times greater than the level of biologica lly natural MF, the geomagnetic field. The magnetic field of magneto somes gradually decreases to the geomagnetic field level at the distance of about 0.5 micron. Near a magneto some, the MF gradient can reach as much as 10 7 that of a usual MRI magnet and be close to that of the electron spin magnetic moment, at a characteri stic distance of about 1 nm. A unique situation is that, unlike a single spin, a magnetosome nonuniform MF covers much greater space. It is interesting that the MF nonuniformity around nanopart icles makes the basis for an additional mechani sm, by which magneto sensitive reactions, known in spin chemi stry, can react to MF. Therefore , magneto some rotations can distinctly affect the rate of these free-radical reactions in biological cells containing such part icles. If a cell contains a magnetic particle, even as small as a few nanometers across, a significa nt part of the cell is covered by the MF of that particle, so that the average rate of free radical formation may increase by a few percent (Binhi, 2008). The severity of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer and Parkinson, has been found to correlate with the amount of magnetite in the human brain, e.g., Bartzokis et al. (1997). A well-known link between excessive iron content in the brain and neurodegenerative diseases is explained in the literature by both direct influence of toxic ferrous ions, by catalyzing free radical formation, and by indirect influence through biogenic magnetite Fe 3 Q 4 (Hautot et al., 2007). Magnetic nanopart icles in brain tissues can provide the sensitivity of animals and humans to weak MFs. However, the research into this area is still in its infancy. MAGNETIC FIELD INTERA CTION WITH MOLECULAR TARGET As often suggested, the MF interaction with a molecular target is a single­ quantum process. The question is closely related to the method of the EM field description, i.e., a classical or quantum mechanical one. As is known from quantum electrodynamics, or QED, low-frequency EMFs may be described as a classical field, i.e., in terms of the amplitude rather than the number of quanta of that field. However, QED allows a most general description and describes EMF"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"68 V. N. Binhi states close to the classical states by means of the so-called coherent states, which minimize the quantum uncertainty. The coherent states are multiple-quantum field excitations. Therefore, the interaction with the classical field is a multiple­ quantum process. It is clear now that the absorption of a single quantum of a low­ frequency field is just a speculative process. Thus, such a process cannot be the real basis to assert the possibility or impossibility of the biological effects of weak low-frequency MFs. As is shown in (Binhi, 2002), general physics principles practically do not limit the sensitivity of possible targets to EMFs. The fundamental sensitivity limit is defined by the lifetime of the quantum state s of a molecula r target. The sensitivity of real systems, including biophysical targets, also depends on the probability to absorb EMF quanta. It is significantly lower than the fundamental limit. However, the probability for EMF quanta to be absorbed is determined by a specific target structure only. Thus, interaction of an ELF MF with a molecula r quantum target is a multiple quantum process; the conventional formulation of the kT problem and its consequences are not valid for such pr ocesses. The primary principles of physics impose virtually no limitations on the sensitivity limit. The microscopic structure of a MF bioreceptor and the lifetime of its states control the level of the sensitivity in any special case. It is important that the lifetime may be great if the state of the target is far from thermal equilibri um. This means higher sensitivity. An example of such molecular target, a gyroscopic molecula r rotator, has been discussed by Binhi and Savin (2002). Generally speaking, the use of such notions as number of quanta of EMF, as well as energy states of a quantum system, implies that the field and the quantum system are sufficiently isolated from each other. This means their interaction energy is significa ntly less than the energies of quantum jumps between the state s of the field or between those of the quantum system, correspondingly. For example, in the case of the interaction of optical radiation of a labor atory HeNe­ laser with an atom, we have eEr /hQ � 10-1, hQ � �£. Here eEr is the interaction energy of an electron of charge e of an atom of the size r with an electrical field E, Q is the circular frequency of the radiation, and �£ is the energy difference between atom's quantum states. That is why the approach based on the field quanta and atom energy level notions appears to be effective. In other words, the states of the whole system \"field-atom\" are reduced to the combination of the states of the atom and field separately."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Can Superweak EM Fields Affect Organisms? 69 In another case, when an atom interacts with weak low-frequency MF, all three energies are of the same order of magnitu de. The interaction energy11 practically coincides both with the Zeeman splitting M1c (Qc =eHgeolmc is the cyclotron frequency) and with the quantum of the ac MF hQ. In this case, the interaction energy is not a small parameter. It means that the presentation of the state of the whole system \"field-atom\" in the form of a combination of the state s of atom and field taken sep arately is not fully true. QED may provide a more reliable description. There is also another reason to think that a QED description is necessa ry to explain weak MF effects on biosystems. Usually, a field-atom interaction is reduced to the scenario, in which EM radiation causes quantum jumps between an atom's energy levels that changes the population of these lev els. With regard to the possible mechanism of the primary magnetoreception, this scenario is not quite perspective since the changes in populations of the state s, which are very close in their energy (by the order of a field quantum), could hardly affect a chemical reaction. Even in some hypothetical ideal conditions, if the energy of the field quanta was pumped to increase the energy of a quantum oscillator, this would take too long a time, about a year, to accumulate the energy of the order ofkT. It is more realistic to suggest a scenario, where the populations of the target states remain constant, but an interference pattern of their space distribution changes. In this scenario, a quantum system or an \"atom\" with an orbital magnetic moment is placed, for simplicity, in a uniaxial MF. The latter is varied just in magnitu de. In such MF, following a quantum mechanical description, the atomic energy does not change at all. But what is changed here, in a resonance­ like manner, is the space distribution of the density of the atomic quantum state. As a result, different orientati ons appear where the probabilities to find the atom are significantly distinct from each other. This redistribution of the probability density may inf luence the rate of a chemical process (Binhi, 2002; Binhi and Savin, 2002). However, in this scenario, as was shown above, the energy of an atom does not change. Therefore, it is not possible to estimate the sensitivity of the system, following the quantum mechanical and semiclassica l approac hes. In this case, a quantum description should be used also for an alternating (ac) MF, i.e., for the low-frequency EMF. Obviously, within this description it is not possible to consider EMF quanta separately, since changes in their number do not correspond to any change in the energy of an atom, which remains constant. In this 11 It is the energy μBH of the magnetic moment μB � eh/2mc of an orbital motion in a magnetic field H; m and c are the electron mass and the speed of light; CGS units."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"70 V. N. Binhi description, just the whole field-atom system has the stationary states, but not the atom and the field taken separately. At these stationary states, dynamical states of the atom and field may be distinguished, having no definite energies. The stationary states of the system differ by populations of the quantum states of the field oscillators, or, that is the same, by the amplitudes of the field oscillations, on the one hand, and by corresponding amplitudes of the oscillation of the interference pattern, or the phases of atom states, on the other hand. Note that here the term \"field amplitude\" appears, since in the ELF range, multiple­ quantum states are adequate, thus allowing to consider amplitudes. It should be stressed again that it is not correct to consider the number of quanta absorbed by an atom in the MF that changes only its magnitu de. The states with different numbers of quanta are stationary states of the EMF; however, there are no atomic stationa ry states that could match them: the states of an atom with different phases are not station ary states, i.e., they all have the same energy. It follows, that an atom and weak MF present an integrated system that cannot be divided into an isolated field and atom without demolishing the holistic entity of the system. At first sight, this statement might seem to be in contradiction with everyday scientific evidence. There are many methods to measure atomic states, and usually nothing happens when MF is slightly changing , of course unless special magnetometry methods are used. However, such methods are destroying methods. In order to measure the state of an atom, such a method has to bring another observable system into interaction with the atom, but the energy of this measuring interaction is greater than that of the original field-atom interacti on. In other words, these methods first isolate an atom from a weak field and only then measure its properties. As a result, what is measured has nothing to do with the properties of the original field-atom system. How to measure the state of a molecular target without destroying its quantum state that is common for both the target and the field? Probably, some particular biophysical structures with long living molecula r rotational states, similar to molecula r gyr oscopes, perform quantum non-demolition measurements that fix just the transfers between those common states. Then variations in MF superimposed on a constant MF might cause the system field-atom to transfer between its stationary states, which would change the results of the measurements of the target state."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Can Superweak EM Fields Affect Organisms? 71 NON-EQUILIBRIUM STATES AND BIOLOG ICAL SENSITIVITY TO EMFS The conventional formulation of the kT problem brings about skepticism with regard to the plausibility of the observed biological effects of weak EM fields and, as it is, does not provoke any efforts to overcome the paradox. Therefore , we believe it is useful to concentrate on two aspects of the paradox: (i) what is the mechanism of the weak MF signal conversion into a (bio )chemical signal and (ii) why such mechanism could be efficient on the background of thermal disturbances of the medium? It is worthwhile to bear in mind two points. First, the notion of kT itself comes from statistical ph ysics. This notion is justified for the systems, which are near thermal equilibrium . Indeed, in such syst ems, neither a single quantum nor many quanta corresponding to a weak low-frequency MF can practically change the mean energy of dyn amical degrees of freedom. However, in the systems just weakly bound to the thermal environment, or the thermostat, the process of thermalization is relatively slow so that such systems may remain for a long time far from the equilibrium . Then an MF can bring about a great relative change in energy of some dynamical variables, the energy of which may be low due to some reason. In other words, the notion of the temperature itself, in its traditional thermodynamic meaning, is not applicable to some degrees of freedom if the thermalization time of these degrees of freedom is greater than the characteri stic lifetime of the system. It follows there is no sense to compare changes in their energy with kT at the absorption of EMF quanta. An example of the non-equilibrium processes is a functioning of some proteins: their relevant degrees of freedom have no time to therm alize. This may happen also in other biophysical nanost ructures. We suggest that weak MFs may change the state of such nonthermalized degrees of freedom and thereby affect the functioning of proteins. Second, the interaction energy of a weak MF with a molecula r target is rather low. It takes at least one year for the energy of an ideal molecula r or ion oscillator to change by the amount of kT even under magnetic resonance conditions. It follows, that MF may play a role of a controlling signal rather than a power factor. Therefore, specific mechanisms are possible, where MF controls the probabilities of the processes to proceed in one or another direction rather than triggers the processes themselves. In this regard, non-equilibrium, or metasta ble, state of a target and probabilistic character of the weak MF signal conversion into a biochemica l"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"72 V. N. Binhi response are necessary properties for the molecular mechanism of magnetor eception. Reactions involving free radical pairs give a clear example of an MF target in a metastable state. An idealized magneto sensitive chemical reaction may be depicted as AB +--+ A* *B +--+ A* + B *, where the intermediate A* *B is a spin­ correlated radical pair in a virtual cage formed by the molecules of the surrounding viscous medium; A* and B* are free radicals. It is known that the rate of recombination A* *B ----> AB and so the rate of free radical formation may change depending on the MF value. Magnetic processes based on spin dynamics of the radicals develop so quickly that the thermodynamic equilibrium has no time to be established. This means spins move coherently and no temperature of spins exists within these minor intervals, usually 1-10 ns. Normally, spins are bound with magnetic moments and so are capable of interacting with MF. The MF dephases coherent spin motion and changes the probability of the pair recombinat ion. Yet, this radical pair mechanism does not provide a firm explanation for biologica l effects of EMFs. It is limited by values of relative changes about 0.1 % in MFs similar to the geomagnetic field, though there is a hypothesis that this could be much greater (Ritz et al., 2004; Ponoma rev et al., 2004). One more example of a non-equilibrium molecular target is the molecula r gyroscope mechanism (Binhi and Savin, 2002). This theory allows one to calculate frequency spectra and other dependences of the reaction probability on any parameters of the EM exposure. In particular, the theory predicts a specific MF dependence for those MBEs that feature resonance like frequency spectra in combined parallel ac/dc MFs. A biological effect should then vary approximately as the squared Bessel function of the argument -the ratio Hac!Hdc of the ac and de MF components. Indeed, theoretical calculations and experimentally observable dependences show a good agreement (Figure 14 ). Yet another example of a metastable molecula r target is water medium. The suggestion that water medium may be a mediator in the MF signal transduction at the biological level was made by many scientists. There are theoretical and experimental works to support this idea, for example (Preparata, 1995; Belov et al., 19 96). In this case, the target is loca ted not inside the protein molecule, but surrounds it and interacts with its surface. The state of water can influence the protein conformation changes and, consequently, its activity. Elementary targets in water matrix are most likely the magnetic moments of protons, which are in long-living metastable states, forming the hydr ogen bonds in water (Binhi and Rubin, 2007). Concerted simultaneous MF effect on the magnetic moments, and thus on the proton spin states, affects hydrogen bond rearrangements owing to the"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Can Superweak EM Fields Affect Organisms? 73 Pauli Exclusion Principle for spins.

Adapted from the data anal yzed in (Binhi, 2002). Many ingenious mechanisms have been suggested to explain magnetobiologica l effects of weak EMFs; they are reviewed and analyzed in (Binhi, 2002). Only a few of them discussed the kT problem in part. Possible mechanisms of EMF biological effects, which directly address the kT paradox and demonst rate its misleading character, include (i) stochastic nonlinear dynamics of magneto somes in biologica l tissues, (ii) interference of the angular modes of long-living molecula r states, (iii) radical pair mechanism, and (iv) proton-exchange mechanism related to the metastable states of the proton subsystem in liquid water. The main principles that underlie these mechanisms are probabilistic character of magnetic effects and non-equilibrium state of weak MF molecula r targets. This unequivocally shows that biological effects of weak low-frequency magnetic fields are not at variance with physical laws and they may be explained in terms of classical and quantum physics. As is seen, the effect of weak EMF s on the elementary acts of (bio )chemical reactions gradually finds an explanati on. It is a good basis for searching what this"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"74 V. N. Binhi primary effect leads to at the next levels of the biological hierarchy, for example, at the level of nerve pulse propagat ion. It is worth commenting on the other argument used by the partisans of the thermal EMF effects on biology. They argue that the biologica l effects of weak EMFs are poorly reproducible and so have no scientific or social significa nce. Indeed, some 10-20% of the recent publications report failed attempts to observe such effects. Given a lengthy and uncontro llable process of transforma tion of an EMF signal into a biological response, there is nothing extraordinary that the effect is absent in a specific experiment. Many researchers emphasize that the effect may develop only when an EMF affects a biological system in a proper physiologica l state. The time factor is of importance also, because the system is capable of responding to EMF within a relatively narrow time window. In the majority of experiments, their success depended on a rare happy coincidence of suitable EM and physiologica l conditions. In addition, there are individu als, a few percent in the human population, probably as well as in other biological species, that are less or more sensi tive to EMFs (Hillert et al., 1999; Markova et al., 2005; Schrottner et al., 2007). In a laboratory study (Binhi and Sarimov, 2008), only a few of 40 tested people have shown remarka ble 12-17% cognitive reactions to a zero magnetic field, while the mean level of all the people was statistically significant 1.5%. At that, different groups of the persons showed opposite magnetic effects. Collectively, these and other limitations account for the difficulty to reproduce the results of low-field experiments in bioelectromagnet ics. Many of them await confirmation by independent laborator ies. It follows that the biological effects of EM fields and radiations, where they are nonthermal effects, are of proba bilistic character. Epidemiological studies show, on the whole, rather low association between various disease incidences and the level of occupational or residential exposures to EMFs (Ahlborn et al., 2001 ). Should we rely on these results and agree that EMF effects on humans are socially insignificant? Note that epidemiologica l studies are averaged by definition, but an EM effect on an individual may be significant. How do we react when human rights are broken even with respect to one person? Precisely the same attitude should be adopted towards hypersensitive persons, because their social rights can be violated by the use ofEMFs."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Chapter 6 DISC USSION There is a great difference between brain control and mind control or between brain mapping and mind reading. Brain magnetic manipulation does not necessarily give rise to mind manipulat ion. Does EM mind control exist? What could be proof of this? By definition, it is technology or methods that would be able to have control over the mind of a person. At that, both the technologies and theoretical knowledge behind them should satisfy the criterion of science. Otherwise, as was said above, we are not on firm ground. What does it mean? First, EM mind control principles should be physically feasible; they should not be at variance with the well known general laws of physics, chemistry, etc. Second, a socially significant volume of evidence should exist that such technologies have been used by this or that group or institution. In what follows, we will discuss whether these criteria are fulfilled. EM TARGETING Information appears from time to time about people who believe the government is beaming \"voices\" into their minds and the Pentagon has pursued a weapon that can do that (Weinberger, 2007). Indeed, it should be taken as a well established fact that some people hear another's speech in their heads without any apparent cause. They are called in literature \"voice-to-skull\" persons, or V2K, and \"targeted individua ls,\" or Tis. Usually, the individuals hearing such voices ascribe this to high-tech devices intentionally designed to control people. However, good sense suggests that there are a few possible causes. The effect might be the consequence of either (i) a high-tech science or (ii) a mental illness"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"76 V. N. Binhi or (iii) a kind of personal experience. In all the cases, the verbal signals are real to these persons and deserve respectful consideration. The two cases distinctly differ in their social significance. While mental illness mainly isolates the person in itself, scientific facilities are potentially aimed at society at large and so are potentially dangerous. In the latter case, the \"voice\" evidence is one of the main reasons to think that a hidden electronic or similar technique exists as mind control engineering . The other essential reason to think in this way is continuing military attempts to take hold of the control of the human mind. By no means can the dramatic reports of V2K persons and Tis be indications of EM mind controlling, since there is no way to understand whether the reports themselves reflect physical reality or medical pathology, a mental illness or an occasional personal experienc e. Neither similarities between Tis' experiences, nor the failures of drugs to fix their problem s, can serve as a proof of real deliberate electronic surveillance or harassment as well as the facts that some institutions have been engaging in studies around EM mind control actually prove nothing definite. Attempts to search for new effects to overcome limits set by modem technical knowledge have always existed and will continue to exist. However, the results of such studies are far from always positive. This study is not addressing probable causes of mental illness of Tis and other like persons. It would be an are a of medicine or psychology. Despite the fact that some experts assume voice-hea ring people suffer auditory hallucinations or schizophrenia, and others consider some of the reports about \"mind control experiences\" as likely reflecting delusiona l beliefs (Bell et al., 2006), there are reasons to examine possible technical sources of those verbal signals. The material presented in the previous sections of this book provided specific scientific evidence of what is possible and what is not possible from a technical viewpoint. What pros and cons exist regarding EM mind control? CON ARGUM ENTS Social Insignificance On the request \"electromagnetic mind control,\" Google returns approximately three thousand links. Is it many or few, is it a socially significant number? For comparison, that of a more general term \"psychotronic weapons\""},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Discussion 77 that include high-power technique gives tens of thousand links and \"mind control\" scores up to millions links. It is interesting that the scientific program of the Third international interdiscipli nary congress ''Neuroscience for Medicine and Psychology\", which included 16 sections and approximately 150 original works, did not contain reports that could be associated with EM mind control. The program of the Fourth European Symposium on Non-Lethal Weapons, Germany, May 2007, does not mention the word \"mind\" or \"brain.\" As we can see above, the highest level brain-controlling technique that could, in pri nciple, be used as a necessary constituent of even imperfect mind reading technology is very expensive. There are no evident reasons for a government to use such an expensive facility, assuming it exists, to control minds of rather usual inhabitants that Tis are. Failure to Prove Of course, evidence reported by Tis cannot be taken as a proof of existence of EMC. As is stated in Weinberger (2007), \"it's reasonable to assume that if the defense establishment could develop mind-control or long-distance ray weapons, it almost certainly wou ld.\" There are reasons to share this conclusion. Nuclear weapons are a matter of fact. Therefore, we know outra geous facts of its war application; we can track many nuclear tests, crashes, etc. The same is true with regard to chemical and biologica l weapons, but not to EM mind control weapons. The main weakness of almost all publications on EM mind control is in a clear bias, which is the prejudication that either secret EM mind control technology already exists, or such technology is not possible in principle. In both cases, it immediately makes the material unsuitable for anal ysis, since facts are being organized so as to draw pre-given conclusions. Until now, there are no scientific works examining and studying physical aspects of the problem, besides its possible medical aspects. Technical Lack Technically, in order to perform microwave targeting at a given person who is free to move anywhere, two arrangements must be done. First, the position of the person should be detected. In principle, a global positioning and tracking system might be used for locating and targeting an EM radiation beam at the"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"78 V. N. Binhi person. GPS systems are very exact and can locate a target at an accuracy of about 1 meter, which would be well enough to target EM radiation by a phase array microwave antenna. However, such a targeting might be effective only in conditions of open country. The conditions of an area would make microwave targeting ineffective due to multiple reflections, absorptions, and scattering at any substanc es. Hence, targeting by EM radiation at a person moving over streets, shops, transport vehicles, etc. would be impossible. Analyzing known brain magnetic stimulation technique, we could not see indications that even transcranial magnetic stimulation-alm ost contact and rather strong influence-was able to induce verbal signals or specific ideas in tested humans. Second, microwave auditory effect is also hardly possible because of the high power required to induce hearing and because of expected low speech discrimination and low phrase intelligibility. Where low-frequency MFs and nonthermal effects are supposedly used to affect an individual, the following difficulties must be addressed. (i) Targeting is impossible since a low-frequency MF source necessarily covers large areas. (ii) Known nonthermal effects are of proba bilistic character; it is difficult to get a nonthermal effect even in laboratory conditions, since its appearance depends on too many physiological parameters , which always vary, and physical parameters, such as static MF, static electric field, polarization, etc. They unpredictably vary in non-laboratory conditions. (iii) There are no known scientific studies, where low-frequency MFs were able to transfer sensible information or to induce a sort of thoughts, even in laboratory conditions. Remote EM Mind Reading not Possible The number of neurons in a human brain is about 101 0 , each one being connected with approximately 10 3 other neurons. There are also neurons connected to 10 4 -105 other neurons. These communication connections between neurons, called synapses, do form a giant neuronet. Figure 15 illustrates such a net. The number of the connections, which perform thinking and carry thoughts is then about 101 4 , in order of magnitu de. Now, we can roughly estimate the number of different thoughts that might be produced by the net, suggesting, very speculatively, that a thought may be represented, on average, by a thousand excited connections. This quantity is enormously1 2 large: about 1011 43 0 . It is more than the hundredth power of the Googol, the large number, 101 00 , that exceeds the 12 The number of combinations of size k from a set with n elements can be approximated by the formula ( en/k)k/(2rck) 1 1 2 , for n> >k."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Discussion 79 number of all particles in the known Universe. This example well illustrates boundless opportunities of our minds to generate thoughts. Generally speaking, to know thoughts one should know the state of a significant part of neuron connections. De spite the fact that only a small part of neurons may take part in thinking , the number of their connections is still enormous enough to make hopeless the attempts of reading a single thought. Short range technique, like that used for brain mapping with fMRI and magnetic encepha lography, allows one to watch for activity in a particular part of the brain and correlate it with what someone is telling or thinking . It is of course, very far from actual mind reading, since space/time resolution is not enough to monitor the state of each neuron and the states of its connecti ons. However, the resolution is enough to discern types of though ts, which are known to correlate with pattern-like space distributions of excited parts of the brain. As for today, the technique provides patterns consisting of hundreds of elements. This enables one to distinguish certain thoughts among several pre-given thoughts that intentionally reflect rather different types of thinking . Beside the stationary facilities, under discussion in literature now are \"cognitive feedback helmets\" that would allow remote monitoring of a human mental state. However, as is seen, these modem technologies require many sensors to be located on the surface of a human head. The possibilities of the MRI technologies are also space-con strained, as was discussed above. No technology, able of remotely gathering data on the brain activity, could be conceived of being real for purely physical reasons. Figure 15. A tiny part of a net formed by interacting neurons in the brain. The black nodes portray neurons."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"80 V. N. Binhi PRO ARGUM ENTS EM mind control, if it existed, would have a great potential of violating human rights when used without due supervision. This means that it is socially significant, even in its present state of a hypothetical possibility. Natural scientific ground for EM mind control is non thermal biological effects of weak EMFs. There is a widespread opinion that such nonthermal effects of weak MFs are not possible as they are allegedly in conflict with physics. The same is even more insisted on with regard to biological effects of superweak EM radiations. However, it is not true: as we saw, there are both direct experimental evidence and theoretical grounds for believing these effects are real. A prejudice should be avoided at least until full scientific knowledge is obtained for the EM biological effects. As was seen above, targeting humans with directed EM fields or radiations for a long time, which would be necessa ry to cause a reaction, is hardly possible. Only large populated areas are possible for EMF exposure. Probably not all people are sensitive to weak EMFs (Leitgeb and Schrottner, 2003), though it is not an ultimate fact yet (Rubin et al., 2006). Then only a small part of humans covered by EM fields or radiations would react; this looks like the effects of targeted radiation. From published experim ents, we know the technical parameters of those EM fields and radiations that may cause biologica l reactions in human organisms. Using these paramete rs, one could estimate whether it is technically real to expose large groups of people by EMFs in a clandestine way. From the observations cited above, there is evidence, though limite d, that nonthermal biological effects may be induced by microwave s at a power flux 10- 4 to 1 o- 18 W/cm 2 . Taking the log mean value p = 10-11 W/cm 2 and the power of a microwave source P = 1 W only, we can calculate that this source would cover areas at distances up to r= (P/4 n p)1 12 ;:::; 1 km, with omnidirectional radiation. Low-frequency MFs as low as 10- 6 to 10-1 2 T were shown above to be able to cause biologica l responses. Again, taking the log mean value B = 10-9 T, i.e., 1 nT, the size of a magnetic dipole about 1 m, and the feeding current 10 3 A (a thousand-tum wire coil fed by 1-A electrical current) one could calculate that this source can produce 1-nT MF at a distance about 60 m. In another embodiment, a distributed one-tum closed wire contour of about 1 km in size and energized by 1- A current would generate the same 1-nT MF. An artificial magnetic storm of about 100 nT, imitating a natural geomagnetic storm, could then be produced by 5-A current passing through a 60-m contour."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Discussion 81 What is apparent is that a brain might be remotely exposed to EMFs only as a single whole. Only relatively large parts of the brain could be in different EM conditions under the exposure to an EM radiation, when a certain orientation of the head regarding the source of the radiation is kept fixed. However, this makes no connection to localized brain stimulation like in TMS. So, what we could expect in the future is a modification of a human brain by a special EM radiations or fields, which could expose a whole brain and work like specific drugs making a human mind vulnerable to an intelligent speech or command s. No specific thought induction by remote EM exposure would be possible. It is interesting that drug -based methods of mind control are also somewhat problemat ic. The drugs that have an effect on the brain can be divided into known categories: sedative-hypnotics, tranquilizers, stimulan ts, narcotics, and hallucinoge nics. However, among these there were no drugs known in the 1960s that would have any usefulness in the control of the mind (Berger, 1967). The above EMF sources, both the microwave and the compact low-frequency ones, would be easy to install in a usual apartment, even if they were 10-fold more powerful. At that, an important question is raised why the EM signals as small as 10-11 W/cm 2 or 1 nT generated by those particular sources should cause specific biological effects on the much stronger natural background produced by a lot of home or municipal electric appliances and technique, like mobile communicat ions, lighting units, power lines, transportation, etc. We have to conjecture that it is the human mind that should somehow hear or see only the \"useful\" signal and be immune to the noise EM backgrou nd. It is a sticky problem awaiting a solution. Well-known geomagnetic storms that of ten occur in the days of acute health conditions in some people make this problem quite urgent. Sometime s, loca lized delivery of EMFs to individuals or groups of people is considered to be realized through the available electric wiring or by means of mobile phones (Grigoriev et al., 2006). The work (Havas, 2006), devoted to the so-called \"dirty power,\" confirms that home electric wiring might be used as a way to incorporate malicious signals into home life. Usage of mobile phones to affect human minds when mobiles are on line is assumed to be through cell­ phone-vir uses, on the analogy of the computer viruses. In that way, phone wearables might be caused to change the generated code so as to reach a maximum link to brain tissues. However, in view of the technical and principal physical difficulties considered above, these latter con jectures seem to be too speculative. It is worth remembering here that some people have magnetic iron oxide nanopart icles in their brain that have grown naturally or penetrated from the outside as an occasional contamina tion. A hypothetical possibility could then be"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"82 V. N. Binhi easily suggested that a number of magnetic particles occupy the brain center for anxiety and fear, as a purely individual particula rity. Such persons could actually react to EM fields and radiation by feeling anxious, for the particles mediate the energy transfer from an EM field to brain neurons. Sooner or later, they would associate this anxious state of mind with its real reason-the sources of EM fields and radiations-gener ating the only conceivable explanation, a delib erate action that is targeted on them personally. Under the principles discussed, with all the pros and cons, most likely there is presently not even one good example of what we could consider a technology for remote EM mind control. However, this does not mean such examples could not appear tomorrow. Science quickly becomes more and more powerful and the results move to levels never imagined. Scientific methodology is also developing so as to envision possible contribution of the consciousness of a researcher who performs a study, into the results of the study. Such a contribution raises another important question about the role of consciousness in the above discussed voice­ hearing evidence."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Chapter 7 BEYOND SCIENCE From the above information, it becomes more or less clear that there are serious physical constraints for EM mind control as a kind of objective remote control. Remote EM mind reading is not possible in general. Remote EM implanting information into the human mind is limited by two possibilities. The first one is the microwave auditory effect. The second possibility is chemical-like modulation of the physiological state of the human brain by means of a plain EM stimulation. The second possibility implies further inf luence on mind by any usual communica tive means. None of these two ways is for subliminal transfer of intelligible information. At that, both ways are hyp othetical and are related to future technical achievements rather than to up-to-da te technology. However, facts are inexorable: some people really hear another's speech without an acoustic source. This might be understo od in terms other than EM transmission of informati on. Traditionally, such unusual means for information transmission or extrasensory perception are associated with psi- or paranormal phenomena, or with \"fields of consciousness\" of unknown nature, that might allegedly be produced by the human mind. The main difficulty here is that science does not know such fields. A basic postulate of modem science is that there are only four kinds of fundamental interactions: the gravitati onal, EM, weak and strong short-range nuclear ones. This postulate is in perfect agreement with a number of experiments in physics. But we are also aware that just very recently, a hundred years ago, physics knew only two kinds of interactions; and who knows how many new ones will be discovered in the next hundred years. However, it is not a very compelling argument. Scientists of past centuries had in front of their eyes many obvious and spectacular phenomena, which were awaiting a scientific explanati on. The attraction and repulsion exhibited by amber,"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"84 V. N. Binhi the mysterious interaction between some stones and bits of iron, \"falling apples,\" lightning , sun radiation, alchemical conversions, the life , etc.: all the phenomena did comprise natural electricity, gravity, specific atomic behavior, and radioactivity. At that, they were available for observation by everyone, in principle. Quite another story is the paranorm al. Such observations are extremely rare and occasional; most people have never experienced paranormal events. Parascience is defined in the Oxfo rd English Diction ary as \"the study of phenomena assumed to be beyond the scope of scientific inquiry or for which no scientific explanation exists.\" This situation finds its expression in the following opinions of the majority of the scientific community on the one hand, and of those involved in the paranorm al, on the other hand. One opinion: paranormal effects do not exist because they are not possible in terms of modem science. The other opinion: the paranormal is a fact of life and science will adopt it later as it is developing. It is interesting to support a compleme ntary view: The paranormal is a reality, but science is severely limited in its ability to know what to do with it. This viewpoint reconciles the above incompatible opinions and gives some space to continued research. The basic idea, which underlies this viewpoint, is that introducing consciousness in an experiment does not allow interpreting the results of the experiment. Consciousness may either be the constituent of the object of a study, or belong to a subject of the study, the knowing subject. Where consciousness is intended to be the object and the subject of study simultaneously, one goes beyond the scientific method. Therefore , paranormal experience will ever be out of science, - however, probably, not absolutely. In what follows it is discussed, where the paranormal could be combined with a legitimate scientific inquiry. LIMITATIONS OF THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD At present, science has come closer to the limits of its epistemologica l/methodologica l possibilities. In increasing frequency, scientific journals have begun publishing studies devoted to a particular role of the consciousness of the knowing subject in a process of getting new knowledg e. In these studies, it is stated that the role of consciousness cannot be reduced to a purely cognitive activity, i.e., to contemplating, comprehending , etc. The idea that consciousness could play a specific role in physics, precisely in quantum measurements, has been discussed since the time of its birth (Schrodinger, 1959). Consciousness is assumed to be able to actively change the physical"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Beyond Science 85 characteri stics of a studied object itself, or at least the results of their measurements. As is accepted, this area of research is assoc iated with so-called parascience that studies the paranormal. A by far not complete list of such interesting studies could include the following wor ks: (Targ and Puthoff, 1974; Puthoff and Targ, 1981; Jahn and Dun ne, 1986; Stapp, 1994; Stapp, 2001; Bekhtereva et al., 2002; Targ and Puthoff, 2005; Menskii, 2005; Dunne and Jahn, 2005). We intentionally omit a huge volume of publications in the specialized parapsychological journals, wishing to stay within the framework of physics, because the paranormal is mo stly a physics problem. Even being limited by only the ontological aspect in discussing the paranorm al, a risk is high to be accused of the lack of judiciousne ss. There is a serious medical research that considers paranormal beliefs to be a sign of an abnormality (Wisema n and Watt, 2006). In the above references, the authors, who are recognized authorities in their fields, shy away from the term \"paranormal,\" preferring inconspicuous \"consciousness effects.\" This is caused, in addition, by the circumstance that most often parascience is referred to as pseudoscience, of which the following examples are notoriously known: astrology, alchemy, occultism, etc. Pseudos cience only mimics science, ignoring the scientific method and, therefore , it is unable to provide new knowledge. One should distinguish between parascience in a wide sense, as a social activity opposed to science, and parascience in a narrow sense, as almost usual scientific activity that deviates only little from what is prescribed by strict science, dealing with the involvement of consciousness, usually weak or insignifica nt involvement, in the results of labor atory experimen ts. It is intuitively clear that mind control is \"genetically\" close to paranormal effects such as remote viewing or extrasensory perception, in general, because of the crucial role of consciousness in all these phenomena. Why not assume that reported events of the remote mind reading were actually paranormal effects? To understand it better where we could stay on firm ground, the basic principles of the scientific method are outlined below. Science is a social human activity aimed at mining new knowled ge. Knowledge is one of the most general philosophical categories, for which the precise definition is not possible. There are many formal definitions in terms of different philosophy teaching s, which elucidate this or that aspect of this notion. Here, it is convenient to define knowledge in the spirit of natural scientific positivism. Knowledge is what expands the boundaries of our being in time and space. What does \"to know\" mean? Alwa ys, when we say we know something, we implicitly have in mind the following. First, what we are speaking about, an"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"86 V. N. Binhi object, is an element of the group of similar objects. Second, this object as well as the group, existed for some time before, and will exist for some time forward . And third, the behavior of any such ob ject is governed by a regularity that, as well, was, is, and will be for some time in the future. It is this relative stability of the regularity, in particular, its independence from mental contemplation or the acts of cognition, that is the basis of knowledge. Knowledge is a right idea about the regularity. Knowledge, formulated in accepted scientific terms and arranged within the present theoretical structure of science, is a theory. Thus, knowledge gives a true insight on past and future, expanding the boundar ies of our being. What does knowledge have to do with? We will look into the variety of events constituting the reality. One should first define what is an event. An event is a motion that takes place at a given moment in time and at a given point in space. That is, an event is the idealization where duration of a motion is neglected and where the motion is considered to be a fact that has occurred at some point in space-time. The real world consists of the events. It consists principally of the nonrecurring events. There are also those that, in a way, recur, or replicate . Such events form a physical phenomena available for measurements. The multitude of phenomena is much narrower than the world of events. It is phenomena and not the events that science, aimed at getting new knowledge, has to do with. In this way, the scientific method relies on the assumption that the object exists by itself and that regularity exists, which drives the object's appearance as a chain of recurring events. In other wor ds, it is assumed that regularities exist in them selves without regard to the fact that someone studies them. Thus, science asserts that an object may be studied and the regularity, or the law, may be established. However, the scientific method cannot be used for studying the paranormal, that is, in the cases where consciousness is included into experiment. This might be eas ily shown in the following way. As has been already said, the scientific method is based on isolating the object of study from the knowing sub ject. It is adopted that the object exists by itself regardless of the consciousness of the subject. But obviously, the very existence of the object means the existence of consciousness itself, because they constitute a dialectical pair. Consciousness may also be an ob ject of study. In both cases, it presents an independent entity, or independent self-reality. Then, to define consciousness as something existing objectively, one needs to use entities, or things, which are independent of consciousn ess; otherwise the definition would be impossible. It is this order that is adopted by science. However, if to assume consciousness is able to change entities, the very possibility of defining consciousness as such, as an obj ect, will be lost. But then,"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Beyond Science 87 the other entities are also indefinable as objects. The world appears here as a single whole, as a holistic substance where all depends on all; and even more, there is no these all, the multitude of things, since each one is indefina ble. It is the other world view, which is close to the Eastern mysticism (Capra, 2000). Here, perceiving the world, one cannot analyze, i.e., divide the reality into ob jects. One might just contemplate and try to understand the world intuitively, by irrational perception. It follows, that the notion of consciousness is of double meaning : It may present both subject and object of study. It should be emphasized that it is this subjective cognitive aspect of consciousness that is meant when they speak about the paranormal. It is seen from the circumstance that cognitive activity is a manifestation of will, but it is the dependence of matter on will that is the essence of the paranorm al. In that way, it is not possible to study the paranorm al; it is not a scientific object. It may only be taken as is. There is much to be done, of course, regarding the arrangement of the paranormal in philosophical theory, because now it is in the best consistency only with the least popular and least acceptable teaching-sub jective idealism. In the above reasoning, we managed to do without using general philosophical notions of idea and matter, though it is almost obvious that idea as the product of consciousness should be a relevant term to explain the relation between the paranormal and scientific reality. In this regard, a remark is appropriate that the material and ideal forms of being are both constituents of reality. It is well known that some ideal constructs of the human mind are very real in that general and common meaning that they do not depend on individual thinking . Individual mind can be thought only as a passive interface between these two forms of reality; although dialectical materia lism assumes the ideal is a product of the evolution of the collective human mind (objective idealism says ideal entities are of divine origin). The paranormal may be thought as a way of the direct idea-to-matter connection induced by an individual will. Then the paranormal is not objective and goes beyond science. This statement, or truth, can be shown in many other ways and expre ssed in different terms. However, there is a substantial nuance. It addresses the criteria used to determine that a set of observations has enough quality and one may speak about new scientific knowledge."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"88 V. N. Binhi REPRODUCIBILITY One of the most essential criteria is the criterion of reproducibility. The results of a scientific experimental study should be reproduced regardless of who makes the experiment, where , when and by which instruments the experiment is made. This means the results would be of objective character. But there are no generally accepted prescriptions as to how many times the experiment should be successfully reproduced. Here, all depends on the specificity of the given scientific area and on hands-on experience. In this way, sufficient reproducibility is determined by the human practice in general. It is interesting that the paranorm al, in some cases, demonst rates quite a good level of reproducibility and, based on this, might be considered scientific. Only the fundamental and extraordinary character of the conclusions that could be drawn from such experiments makes the majority of scientific community to display skepticism and to demand higher and higher levels of reproducibility. Could statistics sink the paranormal (Bosch et al., 2006)? It seems that paranormal observati ons acquire or lose scientificity depending on their reproducibility. With all that, it is understandable that just a limited number of paranormal observations show enough reproducibility, and most of them feature a unique irreproducible character. Practically however, there is no distinct boundary between science and the paranorm al. Where consciousness affects matter only in an insignificant measure, in some sense, the effects are rather well reproducible and may be a subject of a quite usual scientific research, described, for example, in (Jahn, 1986; Radin and Nelson, 1989; Radin et al., 2006). At that, the more strong the effects and the less number of people who could demonst rate them, the farther from science these effects are. For exa mple, only a few individuals can demonstrate extraordinary paranormal abilities of their minds (Geller, 1975), if any. Such clear paranormal effects are even considered as the basis for new ways of warfare (Puthoff, 1996). Though the CIA closed the remote viewing program in 1995, with a conclusion that the results were disappoi nting (Moreno, 2006), studies are going on (Steinberg, 2005). There are mind technologies based on collective meditation technique worked out by different psychotechnology schools, for example Maharishi University (TMP, 2007). This latter technique, called transcendental meditation, or TM, seems to cause real individual effects, judging on statistical data (Walton et al., 2004). The TM technique was proposed by Mahari shi Mahesh Yogi, an expert on the ancient Indian tradition. It is a simple psychophys iological 20-min twice-a-da y procedure taught by trained instructors . During the meditation, a"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Beyond Science 89 reduction in mental and physical activity occurs as a result of experience of a state different from usual waking, dreaming , or sleep states. People practicing it have beneficial health effects. What is surprising is that TM, when it is practi ced by a large group of people, or by a smaller group but simultaneously (TM-Siddhi technique), causes an effect that might be thought of as paranorm al. It is a social effect caused by a collective meditation. Statistically significa nt improvement of the quality of life was measured in cities, countries, and even in geopolitical regions, where more than 1 % of the population were practicing TM, see (TMP, 2007) and references therein to social research studies. Even less meditating people were required with the TM-Siddhi technique, about square root of that 1 %, to affect the social proce sses appreciably. Measured indexes were associated with the following social indicators : traffic accidents; crime rate; terrorism and international conflicts; social stress; unemployment and economic indices, alcohol, nicotine, and drug abuse, etc. The way in which statistics has been used in these studies was argued in (Schrodt, 1990); it is therefore difficult to conclude on the scientific quality of those studies. However, it is worth mentioning the volume of research performed concerning the effect: over 600 studies at more than 200 research institutions in 35 countr ies during the past 40 years. Possibly, the Mahari shi effect is a part of reality, but certainly, it is neither a part of a physical, nor a part of the ideal world, for it necessarily involves their direct connection. In any way, social effects of TM imply that many people meditate more or less synchronously, and so TM technique could not be used for improper purposes and be considered a mind control technique. Proponents of the paranormal mostly do not raise the question of the physical nature of it. It is clear why. There is no possibility to explain these phenomena, because they are beyond science. It means, for example, that the question about the physics of the carrier of the paranormal information transmission is meaningless. The same is valid with regard to the energy transfer: no energy transfer occurs and the energy conserva tion law breaks in the paranorm al. The paranormal appears out of ph ysics. It is the reason why paranormal observations are principally irreproducible: there is no objective reality behind them. Some researchers, however, think the paranormal could find an explanation within an advanced physical theory. There is a long history of attempts to interpret paranormal observations within the context of the physical theories (Beichler, 2001 ). Mainly, researchers look into quantum mechanics, more accurately, into quantum metaphysics, to find a place for human consciousness and explain the effects of mind on matter (Schrodinger, 1959; Penrose, 1994; Stapp, 2001; Josephson, 2003; Menskii, 2005)."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"90 V. N. Binhi This position is based on a belief that consciousness transcends the material world. On the other hand, quantum mechanics is not reduced to just physics. At a closer view, it poses very profound questions about the relationship between the observable reality and an observer. It turns out that some properties of matter do not exist before an observer observes them. It is this aspect of quantum mechanics called quantum metaphysics that is so attractive for explaining the consciousness­ related phenomena (Bohm, 2002). It is interesting to point out another theory that develops the general relativity theory and pretends to high scientific status. In this theory, the well-known equations of the fundamental fields- gravitati onal, EM, and quantum fields­ appear as some limiting cases (Shipov, 1998), i.e., the theory satisfies the basic requirement of scientific methodology. One of the most senior experts in general relativity theory, M. Carmeli, professor in theoretical physics at Ben Gurion University, write s: I find the work of Dr. Shipov quite original and creative. His ideas about \"Universal Relativity\" and \"Phys ics Vacuum \" are greatly interes ting, and are excellen tly de veloped by him to a theory, which seems as a continuation of Einstein 's work (Carmeli, 2005). Other experts dismiss the theory because its development was not accompanied by publications in specialized journal periodicals, which would be a normal process in the scientific community (Rubakov, 2000). A specific object of this theory is the fields of space torsion, which is associated with the known geometric properties of space-time. Being \"primary,\" torsion fields suppose dly have very unusual properties, which might be a basis for the paranorm al. As for today, torsion fields remain a hypothesis due to the lack of experimental evidence. In finalizing this section, one could suppose that many strange events that the involved individuals incline to identify as an electronic harassment are actually only bright manifestations of the paranorm al. It would be rather difficult to study such observati ons in a scientific manner. As was assumed above, scientific method is applicable to the paranormal only at small values of the effects, which in tum requires large stati stics. This would be hardly possible for that sort of observations. It is only a matter of time that the facts of verbal signals induced in some people's heads will either become an area of science or will not. This, however, does not mean that these facts do not dese rve attention. They are real facts that are worth being taken into attentive consideration."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Chapter 8 CONCLUSION To the best knowledge available, among EM facilities, only SQUID magnetomet ry, MRI devices, and TMS inductors can noncon tactly map the brain electrical activity. Even in this case, the absence of electrodes is rather conditional: sensors should be placed in the very proximity to the head in order to obtain information at an acceptable signal-to -noise ratio. There is no scientific information about the hypothetical possibility of EM scanning brain activity remotely, even in laboratory conditions, when the head of a human can be fixed with regard to a scanning facility. As well, there is no evidence that TMS or standard stimulation could induce any intelligible information flows in the mind of a treated individu al. The author of the present book thinks EM mind reading is not possible as a phenomenon. There are no natural scientific prerequisites for that to be possible. There are neither well-established facts of EM mind reading, nor experimental and theoretical grounds that could secure the existence of this sort of mind control. Difficulties are related to simple physical constraints. The resolution of brain-mapping devices drastically decreases with the distance to the brain surface. As to the possible influence of EM fields and radiations on the human mind, specific technical aspects of EM targeting and the probabilistic character of the nonthermal EM interaction with biological systems set certain limitations making mind control somewhat problematic as well. However, there are no physical reasons to assert that EM mind control is not possible. Under the inf luence of a remote source of EMF, the brain is exposed to the EMF as a whole. Therefore , one could expect that the EM impact would be similar to that of chemicals, which do not carry information but can induce particular states of mind. The human mind in such a state could be sensitive to verbal suggestions transmitted by usual communication tools. Then, it could be in fact a weapon where EM fields and radiations really cause significant chemical-like effects. But, though nonthermal"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"92 V. N. Binhi EM biologica l effects have been observed in laborator ies, their social significance remains questiona ble. As well, there is no complete clarity yet regarding the potential use of the microwave auditory effect, provided the physical constraints discussed above. Weak EM fields can be delivered to individuals or to the groups of people secretly. For example, large-scale wire coil, of about the size of a building or even a city, can produce MFs similar to the geomagnetic storms. There are no principal obstacles that might block the development of such weapons. Overall, possible scientific grounds for EM mind control look rather unconvmcmg . At the same time, much non-scientific information about EM mind control mainly is a meld of fact and fiction. The associations of sensitive individuals exist, which claim attention and insist that they are subjected to electronic surveillance and harassment by means of EM radiations. Two factors prevent us from recognizing Tis' personal testimonies as substantial data: (i) their subjective character and (ii) uncontro lled conditions of their gathering . It is precisely why everyday knowledge differs from the scientific one. And if the first limitation could be avoided by a suitable statistical approach, as it ta kes place for example in medicine, the second one is an insuperable hindrance. However, such a state of affairs is not hopeless. Scientific experiments might be conducted with the participation of Tis. The experiments would not be expensive; they require only the good will of the potential victims and a minimal set of radio equipment. Of course, \"he that won't be counseled can't be helped\" (B. Franklin). However, a part of Tis might be wishing to clarif y their cases scientifically, taking part in experiments specially designed to find a cause, or at least to rule out some causes they see probable, primarily, the EM hyp othesis. What could be done then? One might think about passive and active methods to test Tis. Passive shielding from the electric and magnetic fields are the most simple. On the other hand, ELF MFs or RF radiations can be modulated by signals carrying audio information. Under exposure to such EMFs, Tis would either hear or not hear modulating audio signals, which might be easily determined. Tis are probably the best choice for research into mind control as they are aware of what kind of mental signaling they should recognize. There is some strange connection between altered states of consciousness and MFs. On the one hand, when during meditation, consciousness is capable of producing extra MF (Seto et al., 1992; Hisa mitsu et al., 1996) of about 100 nT in the order of value. These MFs could not be explained as generated by natural body electric currents, which produce no more than 1 nT. On the other hand,"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Conclusion 93 people with epilepsy, which might be considered as m altered state of consciousness, demonst rate the highest sensitivity to MFs (Anninos et al., 2003) of the order of 10 pT. This connection is only speculative though, because all those experimental findings look impossible in terms of physics and need rigorous validation by independent researchers. It is interesting to suppose the essential role of the paranormal in the considered hearing experience. In this case, some people in an altered state of their consciousness could get information through the extrasensory perception. As was discussed above, in some irregular and therefore non-scientific cases, consciousness significa ntly contributes to the results of observations. We have to state that in such cases the object of a study and the knowing subject do present in a way a holistic entity unable to be analyzed. Finally, does EM mind control exist, or does it constitute a scientific regularity? There is no criterion other than common human pract ice. The social criterion for a hypothetical regularity to be an actual one, i.e., that it belongs to the area of science, states that it should be replicated in different places/laborator ies, in different times, and by different people, or scientific teams. However, there are no generally accepted norms about the quantitative measure of that replicability. Recognition of a supposed phenomenon as an obj ectively existing phenomenon is a long social process that provides for wide discussion by the scientific community. EM mind control is a real phenomenon just for a very limited number of people, though they constitute a social organism: \"there is a big subculture that believes that their brains are being manipulated by insidious forces\" (Moreno, 2006). For the time being, it is far from correspondence to the criteria of scientific knowledge. At the same time, there are no fundamental constraints to realization of remote EM control over the human brain with the goal to bring the mind into obedience of the will or another vulnerable state. Uncontro lled use of such a technology would pose a certain threat for society. For this reason, it would be important to continue research into nonthermal biologica l effects of weak EMFs from the viewpoint of their possible antisocial use. Whether there is a classified project of the EM mind control cannot be determined from open literature. However, the socia l significance, experimental facts, and theoretical evidence support that EM mind control should be investigated further as a possible future threat, even though there is not enough scientific proof of its existence at this time. In a recent book (Moreno, 2006), articles in Nature (Hoag, 2003; Rizzuto et al., 2003; Nat. Editorial, 2003; Rudolph , 2003) and in other journals (Gusters on, 2007; Fins, 2007) the ethical and social issues of possible \"mind wars\" are raised. They urge scientists to"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"94 V. N.
