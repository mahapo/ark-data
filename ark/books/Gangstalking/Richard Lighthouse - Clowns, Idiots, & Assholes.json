Does this seem odd? It only makes sense if the builder and property owner happen to be the Government, and your boss is the CIA. This short ebook documents the continuing fraud, waste, and abuse of public funds that is occurring at the CIA. In 2005, many newspapers carried a story stating the CIA's Domestic Operations were relocating to Denver. This sounded very odd as well. Just like “Animal Farm” book, the CIA continues to believe they are entitled to special treatment and special privileges. “All animals are created equal, but some are more equal than others.” The CIA provides the funding to the Air Force Space Command for the Targeted Individuals program, which includes using microwave satellite weapons on civilians. A new Wing Commander recently discussed his concern about the increasing suicide rate among Air Force personnel in Colorado Springs. This may explain how these military personnel are dealing with the orders to attack U.S. civilians using these microwave weapons. Treason is defined in the U.S. Constitution. Article 3, Section 3, of the U.S. Constitution states, “treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.” Based on this provision in the Constitution, U.S. law – 18 U.S. Code § 2381 – states that “whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere” is guilty of treason. Those found guilty of this high crime “shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.” The CIA employees in Aurora have been provided luxury housing and accommodations as a form of bribery for their silence. They are fully aware of the criminal activities of the CIA, including the microwave targeting. Pictures and examples are provided. “The CIA and FBI are behind most, if not all terrorism,” - Ted Gunderson, former FBI Chief. Introduction There is a significant amount of fraud, waster, and abuse of public funds that is occurring at the CIA. They continue to hide this corruption behind a fake wall of “national security.” The misspent funds are being used to provide perks and fringe benefits for CIA agents, that they would not otherwise be entitled to It is basically a bribe to purchase their silence about many"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"of the illegal activities of the CIA. I have personally seen new homes up to $850,000 provided to CIA agents in Houston (Camp Logan neighborhood, 77007), and memberships to the Houstonian private exercise club at $25,000 provided to young agents. (The agent that received the most expensive home in Camp Logan, was a war vet that lost an arm, and then went to work for the CIA. That still does not justify fraud and abuse of taxpayer funds.) For the agents that were not interested in exercising, they were provided with other perks of equal value, like a covered backyard pavilion with a large screen TV, for drinking beer and smoking. It is nothing less than a bribe. I have seen the local CIA manager provided with a new Mercedes SUV, and two homes – one used as a residence and the other used as an office (6417 Westcott). The Russian embassy is a few miles away at 1333 West Loop South. There are about 50 to 100 CIA agents provided with these luxury accommodations at taxpayer expense, and this now appears to be common where ever the CIA sets up shop. Even Senators, Congressman, and Federal Judges, are not provided homes like this. In January 2015 and January 2016, I wrote many letters to Senators and Congressmen about this fraud. While living in Camp Logan, my home was broken into many times. The CIA has continued this practice of bribing employees in Aurora, Colorado, which is the new Headquarters for the CIA's Domestic Operations. It also keeps them close to their prized program of satellite targeting of individuals from the underground city in Colorado Springs, at Schriever Air Force Base. See the video by Dr Bill Deagle, M.D.: www.disclosurecolorado.com/dr-bill-deagles-experiences-at-schriever-air-force-base-co/ The community housing in Aurora, used for CIA and Air Force officers, are a similar style to the housing that is provided on Peterson Air Force Base, for the senior officers. It appears to date around 2010. It is possible that these communities in Aurora were actually developed and constructed under a contract to the U.S. Government. The community names are Serenity Ridge, Tallyn's Reach, etc – zip code 80016. It appears this area was chosen because it is close to the park and the lake, Aurora Reservoir. I knew to look for this pattern, from my experience living in Camp Logan. However, the main difference in Aurora, is that hundreds and possibly thousands of government employees are being provided these ridiculous perks and bribes at taxpayer expense. In my opinion, this is the real reason the CIA moved to Colorado, because the obvious extravagance would not set well in Washington D.C. It was the house of an Air Force officer that tipped me about it, Colonel Jacob E. Middleton, living at 26042 E Geddes Circle. His home was valued substantially higher (zillow.com) than any of the other Colonels working at Air Force Space Command. He was also the only one that lived an hour's drive away. In my opinion, he is an Air Force Officer and also reports to the CIA, just like Mr Scott M. Anderson. (Keep in mind, the CIA is hacking and altering zillow.com, and I have previously reported this.)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Figu re 1. zabasearch.com Figure 2.

The city of Aurora extends to the propert y limit of Denver International Airport. There have been many rumors about an underground city beneath the airport.

The rumored underground buildings of the CIA at Denver International Airport. Constructed by Bechtel, at a cost over-run of $2 billion dollars. I found an example of a new Wing Commander's introductory speech discussing the increasing suicide rate in the Air Force. If these enlisted personnel are committing suicide, then it might explain how they are dealing with their orders to attack U.S. civilians using microwave satellite weapons. These attacks are even carried out against children and elderly women. That is how sick and disturbed the CIA and Air Force have become. Treason is defined in the U.S. Constitution. Article 3, Section 3, of the U.S. Constitution states, “treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.” Based on this provision in the Constitution, U.S. law – 18 U.S. Code § 2381 – states that “whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere” is guilty of treason. Those found guilty of this high crime “shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.” In my opinion, the CIA continues to be engaged in its primary mission against the United States – it is nothing less than Treason, and they continue to take orders from the Council on Foreign Relations."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The whole \"intelligence community\" cost about $53 Billion per year, including the CIA, NSA, and NRO. One estimate from 2013: http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/national/2013-us-intelligence-budget-additional- resources/421/ According to this document, the number of personnel for FY 2013 for the CIA is 22,206. So we can state that moving the CIA's domestic operations to the Denver area, involved the relocation of thousands of employees. Buckley Air Force Base is home of the 460th Space Wing and the 140th Wing Colorado Air National Guard, is Aurora's largest employer. Some of the largest employers: - Buckley Air Force Base 12,100 - Raytheon Company 2,200  Northrop Grumman 920  Lockheed Martin Corporation 810 On July 20, 2012, Aurora was the site of the third largest mass shooting in terms of number of casualties in United States history, and the second-deadliest shooting in Colorado after the 1999 Columbine High School massacre. In my opinion, it is not a coincidence that the CIA's move preceded the Aurora mass shooting. Under a CIA program called MK-Ultra, Dr Ewen Cameron, performed grisly electroshock experiments on patients, demonstrating that it is possible to turn someone into a mass murderer. This became the background for the book and movie - “The Manchurian Candidate”. For details, see the book by Dr Colin Ross, M.D., “The CIA Doctors.” With the Aurora theater shooting, the CIA criminals were too lazy to go far from their own backyard. Sleep well, CIA criminals.

Note Figure 63. Dr Wood spent many years researching this and filed suit against the US Government, along with Dr Morgan Reynolds. Jet fuel does not burn through concrete and steel. The cookie-cutter holes were made by a high-powered laser that rapidly ages material - and turned the concrete and steel into dust in seconds. Note Figure 38(a) here: http://drjudywood.com/articles/DEW/StarWarsBeam3.html ...Watch the steel beam turn into dust while standing vertically. This laser operates at a harmonic of the blinking frequency - which causes rapid aging. Readers are also advised to see the book and movie \"Unackowledged\" by Dr Steven Greer, M.D. It is available for on Netflix, where it is the #1 documentary, and to watch the youtube videos by the Honorable Paul Hellyer, former Canadian Minister of Defense. He has a book titled, “The Money Mafia.” For more than 5 years, this author has been stalked, harassed, and threatened by US Government agents from the CIA, FBI, and NSA - because of the content of these ebooks. My home has been broken into, repeatedly. In May 2014, my girlfriend was drugged and kidnapped from LaGuardia airport. This is not a joke. My computer, phone, and alarm system have been hacked, including those of my friends and family. It is truly sad and pathetic, these agencies have become criminal organizations. If something happens to me (disappearance, false criminal charges, sudden accident, etc. - my readers can be certain that the FBI and CIA were involved. See my related ebooks identifying the murders of Gary Webb, Michael Hastings, Phil Schneider, William Colby, Dr Eugene Mallove, Stan Meyers, and others. In my opinion, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) is behind these criminal acts; David Rockefeller was the CEO and Chairman for many years. For future reference, I would never deliberately do something that would harm or hurt myself. This goes against my beliefs and against the teachings of Seth. This needs to be stated because the CIA and FBI have proven many times, they are willing to use “staged suicides” to silence whistleblowers. See the recent murder of Mikhail Lesin, founder of Russia Today (RT.com) in Washington DC – clearly a staged suicide. Phil Schneider went public with his information after 8 of his coworkers were murdered using staged suicides. And then he was murdered."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Figure 7.
