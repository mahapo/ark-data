In A-to-Z form, it is mainly a guide to good usage of English, the American variety, contrasted with some 2 , 000 quoted examples of misusage and ques- tionable usage. It does the job of “illumi- nating many traps and pitfalls in English usage” (as my editor puts it). I have sought to provide clear explanations in plain language. This book is designed for general readers as well as those who work with words. The examples were drawn from the popular press, broadcasting, books, and a variety of other sources, mostly in the latter eighties and the nineties. Each entry devoted to a specific word or phrase contains one or more of those quotations. The troublesome forms are contrasted with the proper forms (which are emphasized by italics ) and defini- tions are given. Entries on general topics are pre- sented too; they deal with matters of grammar, punctuation, style, and so on. A list of them, with further description of the two types of entry, appears under “General Topics,” following this intro- duction. With few exceptions, the examples have determined the choices of word entries. Thus the book in part amounts to an informal survey of contemporary problems in English usage. Both perennial problems and new ones come up. Of the misuses discour- aged by earlier books on English usage, some persist; others have not turned up, but, as though to take their place, new offenses against the language have emerged. Here are some hints for finding your way around the volume: • Main entries, headed in boldface, are arranged alphabetically, letter by letter. • Many entries are divided into sections, which are numbered and titled. The sections of an entry are arranged alphabetically, and their titles are listed at the beginning, after the main title. Some sections contain subsections, distinguished by letters and titles. • There are numerous cross- references, some standing alone and others within entries. For instance, in the C ’s under Comma it says See Punctuation, 3, referring the reader to the entry. Many entries refer to related entries. Alphabetical order is used in listing any series of cross- references and various other series. last entry vii introduction Watching Our Words 00-FM_4 10/22/02 10:28 AM Page vii"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Viewpoint This work could be viewed as an anti- dote to laissez-faire lexicography and anything-goes grammar. The doctrine that whatever emerges from people’s lips is the language and that many verbal wrongs make a right is not advocated here. Nor is the cliché of English as “a living language” dragged in to justify bad English. On the contrary, I do not hesitate to distinguish between right and wrong usage when the difference is clear. My inclination is to question deviant forms, challenge innovations to prove them- selves, and resist senseless fads. (See also the final section of this introduction.) I thereby risk being labeled a “purist” by some critics—as though impurity were desirable. Perhaps in a long-range, philosophi- cal sense there is no verbal right and wrong. But that view does not help you and me in choosing our words and putting together our sentences clearly and properly according to the educated norms of society. Those holding the per- missive views follow most of the norms themselves. They do not say or write, “Them guys hasn’t came,” or “I ain’t did nothin nohow,” although some people are apt to do so. For the most part, the laws of grammar have not been re- pealed. Not that one should be pedantic either. The book does not flatly condemn split infinitives, prepositions at the end of sentences, conjunctions at the begin- ning, sentence fragments, or phrases like “It’s me.” But it does value precision over fashion, logic over illogic, and grammatical correctness over “political correctness.” (In my view, those who mutilate our language for political motives do wrong.) At times the difference between cor- rect and incorrect usage is hazy. English has an abundance of words,* more than any other language, and multiple ways to express almost any idea. Our lan- guage is so complex that nobody ever learns it all and that even its leading authorities occasionally stumble. They disagree and one finds fault with an- other. Their differences concern both specific points and standards of strict- ness or looseness in the use of words and grammar. Some loose uses of words or phrases and some slang that may pass harmlessly in informal conversation are inappropri- ate when transferred to serious writing or even serious speech. This book will help the reader to make sound choices. Examples Samples of sentences that clearly fall into the wrong category follow. The first few are (alternately) by professionals of broadcasting and journalism. A correc- tion follows each quotation. (Each comes up in the main text.) “There were roofs completely tore up.” Torn up. “I like to serve it with croutons . . . that is flavored with olive oil.” Are fla- vored. “Police said ——— and ——— built the bombs theirselves.” Themselves. “It would be more racism showing it’s ugly head again.” Its. “There is a way to empower your viii introduction * The Oxford English Dictionary, seeking to record all English words, says it covers more than 500,000 words and phrases in its twenty volumes.

(Headline:) “Be Happy She Prys.” Pries. Additional slip-ups, by people in other fields, include these: (Advertising:) “I always wanted to loose weight.” Lose. (Book publishing:) “Allow someone else to proofread [edit?] it . . . who will not be affraid to be biased in their opin- ion.” Afraid to be unbiased in his opin- ion. (Diplomacy:) “It is quite clear that the crisis has reached a critical point.” Better: the dispute or the situation. (Education:) “Me and my kids live in a dormitory.” I and. (Law:) “No one is free to flaunt the tax laws.” Flout. (Medicine:) “We’re obligated to do that biopsy irregardless of the physical findings.” Regardless. (Psychology:) “Their child don’t look so good.” Doesn’t look. The book debunks some widespread misbeliefs. If we do not fully understand the meanings of certain words or if we accept some clichés on their faces, we may believe that fury rages in the “eye” of a storm; a “fraction” is a small part; the character “Frankenstein” was a monster; to “impeach” an official is to oust him from office; a jury can find a defendant “innocent”; pencils contain the metal “lead”; a “misdemeanor” is not a crime; prostitution is the “oldest profession”; an exception “proves” a rule; the Constitution guarantees “the pursuit of happiness”; and so on. The criticism of any extract does not negate the overall merit of the work that is quoted.* Clarity Clarity is a leading theme of this book. More than 100 entries deal with the problem of ambiguity (noun): the state of being ambiguous (adjective), able to be interpreted in two or more dif- ferent ways. Consider this sentence: “When P—— was hired by H——, he had a criminal record.” Which one is “he”? (That example is from Pronouns, 1.

Clear expression requires clear think- introduction ix *Of 2 , 000 -odd examples of misusage or questionable usage, almost half originated with newspapers, news agencies, or magazines; about a fifth each with broadcasters and books; and a tenth with people in many other fields or miscellaneous sources, described in the text. A few appeared in other reference works. The single most frequent source of examples was The New York Times (usually the national edition), which occasionally is quoted here approvingly too. Newspapers distributed in the San Francisco Bay area and TV and radio broadcasts heard there were significant sources. Dozens of other newspapers, from most regions of the country, yielded examples too. So did 120 books, mostly nonfiction. Some correct or incorrect examples, not counted above, were composed where fitting. The sources of the quotations are not usually identified by name. Space did not permit the publication of a list of such sources (although it had been contemplated). But a variety of ref- erence works consulted as sources of information are listed in the back of the book. 00-FM_4 10/22/02 10:28 AM Page ix"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"ing. It helps also to be versed in the dis- tinctions among words and in the ele- ments of grammar, including tense, number, mood, parts of speech, sentence structure, and punctuation. Even so, clarity may not survive hastiness, inabil- ity to express ideas simply, intentional hedging, lack of facts, language that is too pompous or too slangy, obscurity of ideas or terms, overloading of sentences, overlooking of double meanings, stingi- ness in using words or punctuation, too little thought, or too much abstraction and generality without concrete exam- ples. Then, too, muddiness and confusion can overcome our best efforts. Writers on the English language often compare it with other languages and glory in its complexity, variety, and subtlety. Yet the language is so complex, with varieties of expression so vast, subtleties so fine, and such a proliferation of word meanings, that it can trap any of us at some time or other. Unqualified praise helps no one. Let us be aware of the difficulties and try to overcome them. Greater efforts to write and speak clearly, accurately, and sensibly would mean more understanding, something that society needs. Wounded Words One of the problems is that English is being deprived of the benefit of many distinctive words as looser meanings develop. The addition of the new mean- ings renders some of the words ambigu- ous. I call them wounded words. Examples of those words and their strict meanings follow; loose meanings are in parentheses. Which meaning a writer or speaker has intended is not always plain from the context. A fabulous story is one that is charac- teristic of a fable (or a good story). An impact is a violent contact (or an effect). A legendary figure is mythical (or famous). One who is masterful is dicta- torial (or skillful). To scan a document is to examine it carefully and systemati- cally (or quickly and superficially). If a scene is a shambles, it shows evidence of bloodshed (or disorder). If an incident transpired this year, this year is when it became known (or happened). When an ultimatum is given, a threat of war is issued (or a demand is made). That which is viable is able to live (or feasi- ble).* Many loose or questionable uses are widespread. Does that mean we have to follow suit? Of course not. Save the Language New words continually appear. Those that fill needs are generally desirable. What ought to be questioned or resisted are the watering-down of distinctive words that we already have, the creation of ambiguity and fuzziness, the break- down of grace and grammar, and irra- tional verbal fads. Change characterizes the history of English; but whereas innovations in the main language used to be tested slowly by time, and street slang usually stayed there, they are now both thrust upon the public almost instantly by the media of mass communication. x introduction *Among words in similar condition are these: accost, alibi, anticipate, bemuse, brandish, bru- talize, burgeon, careen, classic, cohort, compendium, connive, cool, culminate, decimate, des- ecrate, destiny, dilemma, disaster, effete, eke, endemic, enormity, erstwhile, exotic, fantastic, formidable, fortuitous, fraction, gay, idyllic, incredible, increment, internecine, jurist, literal, livid, marginal, mean (noun), minimize, neat, obscene, outrageous, paranoid, pristine, quite, sure, travesty, unique, utilize, verbal, virtual, vital, weird, wherefore, willy-nilly.

The choice of using a or an before a word depends on the sound of the word. Use a if the next word be- gins with a consonant: a daisy, a good egg. Use an if the next word begins with a vowel: an ape, an easy victory. The wrong choice showed up in three newspapers. A federal official was quoted (or misquoted) as saying, “We are concerned any time there is a allega- tion of serious wrongdoing. . . .” In an- other news story, an investor “filed a $ 800 million lawsuit.” In a column, a presidential candidate drove “a M- 1 tank.” Corrections: It is “ an allegation,” be- cause allegation begins with a vowel sound. It is “ an $ 800 million lawsuit,” because eight begins with a vowel sound. (The number phrase would be pronounced as eight-hundred-million- dollar. ) And it is “ an M- 1 tank”: Al- though m normally is a consonant, the letter as such is pronounced em. A precedes the sound of the y conso- nant, even if the initial letter is usually a vowel: a European, a ewe, a uniform. The use of an before such a word is not standard. An precedes a word starting with a silent h: an hour, an honorable man. Us- ing an before a pronounced h, in a word whose h was once silent, like historic or humble, is an uncommon practice in the U.S.A. but more common in Britain. It is observed by a few American writers and speakers, such as an anchor woman who said, “NASA today called off an historic space mission.” The foregoing rules assume that one needs a or an (indefinite article) and not the (definite article). A or an goes before a word or phrase denoting a person or thing (noun) but not a specific one. The person or thing is usually singular but sometimes plural: a few good men, a great many people. A or an is properly omitted from some common constructions. One vari- ety contains no followed by an adjective: “no better time” / “no more beneficial discovery” / “no such animal.” Another contains kind, sort, type, species, or the like: “that kind of gem” / “this sort of thing” / “some type of evergreen.” Meaning can hinge on the presence or absence of a or an. “A novelist and poet spoke” suggests one person. For two persons, an extra a is necessary: “A nov- elist and a poet spoke” (although “ both spoke” makes it clearer). “The zoo will acquire an apteryx, or kiwi”—two alter- native names for the same creature. But “The zoo will acquire a koala or a wom- bat”—one or the other. In writing certain phrases that con- tain a, particularly a lot and a hold, some people erroneously affix the a to the noun.

See also THE. Abbreviation. 1. Code letters. 2. Three forms. 1. Code letters A newspaper article uses the initials “APS” eleven times but never says what they stand for. In the same issue, another article mentions “WIPP” twice without explaining it. Another newspaper men- tions “North Carolina A&T State Uni- versity” three times in an article, never informing the readers (mostly non- Carolinians) what “A&T” stands for. A piece by a news agency cites a “DOE study done by Aerospace Corp. of Los Angeles.” The context indicates that the research did not involve female deer. But the uninitiated reader has no way to relate those three letters to “En- ergy Department,” which is mentioned several paragraphs before and after “DOE.” Unless initials are as widely known as U.S., C.O.D., M.D., and the letters of the broadcasting networks, the full name or phrase should be used at first. If the initials will be used thereafter, the full name may be linked to them in this way: “Albuquerque Public Schools (APS)” or “Department of Energy (DOE).” Often initials are unnecessary. In sub- sequent references it may be clearer to refer, for example, to the schools or the department. Better yet, repeat the full name, if it is not too long. Even when initials are explained at the start, they can challenge one’s mem- ory if there are too many of them. A book on international law contains statements like this: “. . . The remaining 40 NNNS parties to the NPT had still not . . . [concluded] a safeguards agree- ment with the IAEA.” One chapter uses such forms some 300 times. A reader needing a reminder has to go back and hunt for it. In telling of the bags O. J. Simpson took to “LAX,” was a television re- porter lax in assuming that everyone knew the airline industry’s code for the Los Angeles airport? San Francisco newscasters continually spell out “SFO,” never identifying it as their air- port’s code. It has at least eighteen other meanings. One of those newscasters said on the radio, “There will be no water rationing this year for East Bay MUD [pro- nounced “mud”] customers.” Some lis- teners may have heard of the East Bay Municipal Utility District. Others may wonder who would want to buy mud. 2. Three forms Technically, three main condensed forms may be distinguished, though all three are often lumped under the word abbreviation. An abbreviation, strictly speaking, is a short version of a word or phrase in writing, such as Rep. for Representative and etc. for et cetera. An acronym is pronounced like a word; it is formed from initials or parts of a name or phrase. Examples are AIDS from acquired immune deficiency syn- drome and LORAN from long-range (aid to navigation). An initialism is composed of initials that are spelled out in pronunciation, let- ter by letter, such as FBI for Federal Bu- reau of Investigation and cc for cubic centimeter(s).

To abide something usually means to endure it, to tolerate it. “Can you abide such hot weather?” It can also mean to await it. A columnist thinks that the press has treated a certain local politician too kindly. The politician “has succeeded in making himself the personification of the city.” An attack on him therefore be- 2 abbreviation 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 2"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"comes an attack on the city “and no one can abide by that.” It should be “and no one can abide that.” Omit “by.” To abide by something is to comply with it, conform to it. “I abide by the law.” / “I’m a law-abiding citizen.” The past tense and past participle of abide is abode or abided. ABOUT TO. See NOT ABOUT TO. Absolute constructions. See Modi- fiers, 1D. Abstract noun. See Nouns, 1. ACCEPT confused with EXCEPT. See EXCEPT and EXCEPTING; Homo- phones. ACCORDING TO. According to is a common phrase that is used in sen- tences like these: “A promising discovery in the fight against flat feet was made this week, according to a local professor.” / “According to the sect, the world will come to an end next Thursday.” It tells us that the statement is made on the authority of the one quoted. It im- plies that the writer does not vouch for the veracity or sense of the statement or may even question it. Thus it should be used with caution. News people sometimes append “ac- cording to” to what should be matters of objective fact. For example: According to the administration, Contra aid will run out September 30 . Will it or won’t it? If the writer has any doubt, he should find out for himself. Some statements are too obvious to need any attribution, let alone the “ac- cording to” form. This item is no scoop: Many Jewish students at SF State will not be attending class today due to Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, according to A—— S——, Di- rector of Programs of the Northern California Hillel Council. [ See also DUE TO. ] Is the reporter so afraid of sticking her neck out that she requires the weight of authority behind an announcement of a holiday? ACCOST. To accost is to approach and speak to someone first. A panhan- dler and a person seeking directions ac- cost people on the street. Some have the mistaken idea that it means to assault or attack. A news report on national television said that several friends were “accosted by a white mob.” Probably attacked should have been used instead of “ac- costed.” A city official, speaking about assaults on parking officers, referred to “their chances of being accosted.” He meant assaulted. Accuracy and inaccuracy. See Num- bers, 5; Quotation problems, 1; Reversal of meaning. Accusative case. See Pronouns, 10 A. ACCUSED, ALLEGED, RE- PORTED, SUSPECTED. 1. Ac- cused in the news media. 2. Two adverbs. 1. Accused in the news media “An accused mass murderer finally gets his day in court,” it was announced on local television. This would have been a better way to phrase it: “A man accused of mass murder finally. . . .” What the newscaster essentially called him was a mass murderer who had been accused. Such misuse of the participle accused has become fairly common among news people. They assume that it protects them from any libel suit. When they de- scribe someone as an “accused thief,” accused, alleged, reported, suspected 3 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 3"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"for example, they mean he is not defi- nitely a thief, just one who has been ac- cused of being a thief. But to call someone an “accused thief” is still call- ing him a thief. “Accused” modifies “thief”; it does not mollify it. Similarly an “accused doctor” or “accused lawyer” is a doctor or lawyer who has been accused. The misuse of alleged, as a synonym for “accused” in its objectionable sense, has long been established among jour- nalists. An example: “Dazed and bleed- ing from a vicious assault . . . Laurie M—— pleaded with alleged attacker David A—— to take her to a hos- pital. . . .” Alleged normally means de- clared as such without proof. But the sentence essentially says the accused man committed the crime; “alleged” scarcely mitigates the nastiness joined to his name. A fairer phrasing would be: “. . . Laurie . . . pleaded with her at- tacker—alleged to be David . . . —to take. . . .” Suspected is apt to be treated in the manner of the other two questionable words. The comments about accused hold for suspected. A “suspected as- sailant” is an assailant who is suspected, according to the literal meaning of the words. In stating that “serious damage has been done to national security by convicted or suspected spies,” two news- paper by-liners show that they regard “suspected spies” the same as convicted spies. ( See Guilt and innocence, 3. ) The word reported often is used in a similar grammatical way. Although usu- ally applied to incidents, rather than people, its presence can raise questions. For instance, when a news story men- tions a “reported crime,” is it referring to a crime that has been reported to the police, or is it just using “reported” in its vague, journalistic sense, as a supposed hedge against legal action, or as if to say: “We’re not sure that it happened, but we were told that it did”? Writers and editors should be aware that none of the four words in question will protect them against suit. It is not enough to say “There really was an ac- cusation”—or “allegation” or “report” or “suspicion”—if its substance was false or erroneous. As a rule of thumb, avoid charged prose if there is no charged defendant. 2. Two adverbs Allegedly and reportedly (a later ar- rival) occupy the domain of the news media, and there they should be con- fined. They are used in this way: “The accused man allegedly [or “reportedly”] struck the victim.” In grammatical terms, the selected adverb modifies the verb, struck. Someone ought to explain in what manner the accused person struck the other when he “allegedly” struck him or “reportedly” struck him. During our Persian Gulf war, a banner in an American newspaper cried: “Hus- sein reportedly asks for asylum in Alge- ria” (referring to President Hussein of Iraq). The “report” came from a French newspaper, which cited no source. No more was heard of it. We need not pon- der the unimaginable act of “reportedly asking”; a larger question is involved: When an editor finds a story so shaky that he must qualify its headline with “reportedly,” should he not think twice before running it at all? ACRONYM. See Abbreviation. ACROPHOBIA. See HOMOPHO- BIA. “ACROSS FROM.” These two sen- tences, which appeared in newspapers in Texas and New York, raise questions: “The farm is across from the plant.” / “. . . This man’s brother was across from the President’s house with a gun. . . .” Across what? The tracks? The street? The park? Use of the slang term “across 4 acronym 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 4"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"from” requires that the topographical entity in the way be obvious. Active voice and passive voice. An announcer broadcast the following sen- tence, and in a sense he spoke with two voices. If you’re in the market for high- quality furniture, this sale should not be missed. Notice how weak the sentence gets after the comma. It starts out in the active voice and finishes in the passive voice. It would have more punch if it followed through actively: “. . . don’t miss this sale” or “you should not miss this sale.” The inconsistency as much as the relative weakness of the passive voice impaired the announcement. Voice is the form of a verb that indi- cates whether the subject of a sentence performs the action or receives the ac- tion. The two sentences that follow ex- press the same thought in two ways. • “Matilda found a chinchilla” is in the active voice. The subject (Matilda) performed the action. • “A chinchilla was found by Matilda” is in the passive voice. The subject (a chinchilla) received the action. The active voice is more direct and usually more forceful than the passive. Nevertheless, the passive has a place. You may want to emphasize the doing and play down the doer. The identity of the doer may be obvious, unknown, in- significant, or indefinite: “Letterpress printing is not used much now.” / “Flags are being lowered to half-mast.” / “The package was delivered yesterday.” / “It just isn’t done.” A book on world history says, “The Neolithic stage in culture is character- ized by the following important innova- tions:” Five numbered paragraphs fol- low. Such a format lends itself to the pas- sive. Too much passive can get dull. Scien- tists load their writing with it. If you read research papers, you can get the idea that scientists never do anything. Somehow everything is done, as though by magic. Take the following description of an experiment, from a biology annual (emphasis added). Stock suspension of normal eryth- rocytes were prepared from freshly heparinized rat blood. . . . The plasma and buffy coat were removed, and the cells were washed. . . . The super- natant of the first washing was discarded, and the cells were resus- pended and diluted. . . . NACl dis- solved in 10 ml sodium buffer, at the appropriate Ph, was chosen for the preparation of the hypotonic solu- tions. . . . The required standard 50 % hemolysis was reached by adjustment of the NACl concentration. The combining of voices can produce a sentence that is not just weak but also ungrammatical. It happens when a verb in the active part does not agree with anything in the passive part . Such a sen- tence appears in the foreword of a gener- ally admirable dictionary. The sentence preceding it says the editors do not give merely the essence of a definition. Instead, the reader is given the neces- sary additional connotative informa- tion, even if it means devoting a good deal of space to doing so. . . . The sentence is passive up to the second comma; thereafter it is active. That fact alone does not spoil it. The trouble is that the words “doing so” do not refer to anything. If, for instance, the sentence began (in an active voice ) “Instead, we insist on giving the reader the active voice and passive voice 5 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 5"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"necessary . . . ,” doing so would fit. An- other way to correct the sentence is to make the second part “. . . even if it re- quires a good deal of space.” Double passives can be awkward. This is acceptable (though not an illus- tration of energetic reporting): “The sus- pect was said to be wanted in three states.” This, however, is too clumsy for publication: “The peak was again at- tempted to be climbed.” Better: “An- other attempt was made to climb the peak.” A passive believed, reported, said, or thought will tolerably combine with another passive. Many others will not: attempted, begun, forgotten, pro- posed, sought, and so on. AD and ADD. See Homophones. ADAPT and ADOPT. To adapt something is to adjust or change it so as to make it suitable for one’s purpose. Hollywood writers often adapt novels to the screen. To adopt something is to accept or take it as one’s own—unchanged—as one would adopt a child. An anchor man who referred to “the platform that the Democrats adapted in Atlanta” chose the wrong word. It should have been adopted. By the way, adopted children have adoptive parents. Adjectives and adverbs. 1. In gen- eral. 2. Placement. 1. In general An adjective describes someone or something. (In terms of grammar, it modifies a noun or pronoun.) Examples of adjectives are green, wet, and Euro- pean. An adverb describes an action, or it further describes a description. (It modi- fies a verb, an adjective, or another ad- verb.) Examples of adverbs are thinly, probably, and increasingly. It seems as though every piece of writ- ing about improving one’s English has to contain some mistake. (The book you are now reading is probably no excep- tion.) So a newspaper article on legal En- glish indirectly quotes a judge “who advises lawyers to write like good news- paper reporters: simple and straightfor- ward.” And ungrammatically? You may write a simple piece or write a piece that is simple— this word is an adjective only. But you write simply— this word is an adverb only. Unlike simple and simply, straightfor- ward may be used either as an adjective or as an adverb. Among other words that serve both as adjectives and as adverbs are down, far, fast, first, little, much, same, straight, very, and well. They have one form only. (They are sometimes called flat adverbs. ) The following are more examples of words that double as adjectives; used as an adverb, each has an alternative form ending in -ly, the form of most adverbs: bright, cheap, loud, quick, sharp, slow, strong, sure, and tight. Some writers consider the -ly form —brightly, cheaply, etc.—more formal or fancy. In some cases, adding -ly changes the meaning. Each of these is a combined adjective and adverb: hard, high, late. And each has an -ly form with a different meaning: hardly, highly, lately. Hyphens should never be attached to adverbs ending in -ly: “a strongly worded letter” / “the rapidly moving train.” (Some adjectives end in -ly and are subject to hyphenating when at- tached to participles. See Punctuation, 4D. ) Sometimes an adjective is erroneously used for an adverb and vice versa. An at- torney general said, “We take it very se- rious”—instead of seriously, the adverb. A psychologist said, “You’ve done all of those things that sound wonderfully”— instead of wonderful, the adjective. ( Sound is a linking verb. See Verbs, 1F. ) 6 ad and add 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 6"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Descriptive terms ought to be stinted, used only when needed to paint a pic- ture.

Placement An adjective may go just before the noun it modifies, as in “A yellow bird appeared” (an attributive adjective ); or it may follow a linking verb, as in “The bird was yellow ” (a predicate adjective ). Contrary to the syntax of many lan- guages, in English we would not be likely to speak of “a bird yellow.” Nor- mally an adjective does not immediately follow the noun it modifies. Exceptions are found in poetry, for instance: “thy spirit . . . With its life intense and mild. . . .” See also “PROOF POSI- TIVE.” Where to put adverbs often perplexes people. Typically an adverb goes just be- fore a simple verb: “They often bring flowers.” It may go at the beginning of a sentence or clause or at the end, particu- larly if it gets emphasis: “ Unfortunately she failed.” / “The river is rising rapidly. ” The placement of an adverb can dras- tically affect the meaning of a sentence, such as this one: “A plan for reducing the work force slowly has been pre- pared.” The sentence is ambiguous. Does it refer to “A plan for slowly reduc- ing the work force” or does it mean that the plan “has slowly been prepared”? If an auxiliary is helping the verb, it is perfectly proper for the adverb to go be- tween them: “We will soon know the re- sults.” / “His support would quickly vanish.” Some writers have the mistaken notion that an adverb cannot split a verb phrase, such as will know or would van- ish. That notion seems to stem from the concern about split infinitives. A news story said “her family’s home badly was damaged.” The sentence structure has a Germanic flavor. Telling the story orally, the writer would proba- bly say “her family’s home was badly damaged.” Similarly, a news story in another pa- per said “the stadium measure heavily was favored.” Better: “the stadium mea- sure was heavily favored . ” An author wrote, “I have no great ob- jection to . . . its [Cockney] being denied officially the status of a dialect.” Better: “being officially denied. . . . ” If a verb has more than one auxiliary, it gets complicated. The adverb normally goes after either the first or second auxil- iary, depending on what it is supposed to modify. • “You will always be welcome in our house.” Here the adverb applies to the whole compound, will be welcome, and follows the first auxiliary, will. • “He will be sharply reprimanded.” Here the adverb specially applies to the main verb, reprimanded, and goes right before it. When in doubt, one can play by ear. If it sounds right, it is likely to be right. An adverb made up of a number of words often follows a verb phrase. “I have said it again and again. ” When it comes at the beginning, an adverb can modify an entire sentence or clause. “ Usually she arrives early and bakes the bread.” Usually applies to both arrives and bakes. It is a mistake to adjectives and adverbs 7 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 7"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"overlook the effect of the adverb on the second verb, in this manner: “ Skillfully he concluded the difficult operation but collapsed from exhaustion.” Make it “He skillfully concluded” to avoid say- ing, literally, that he skillfully collapsed.

Acknowledgment. 2. ADMISSION and ADMITTANCE. 1. Acknowledgment When it does not have anything to do with entry, admission is acknowledg- ment that a statement is true, a state- ment that reflects more or less unfavorably on the one making the ac- knowledgment. Admission can range in seriousness from a trivial concession for the sake of argument to a confession of a crime. It can be used in a general sense (“Taking the Fifth Amendment is not admission of guilt”) or specifically, applying to some- thing acknowledged (“His admission that he took an illegal drug did not pre- vent his election”). Your acknowledgment of a fact that does not reflect upon you, except per- haps favorably, is not an admission. The word does not fit this sentence, from an article by a news service: A new 13 -city survey finds Phila- delphia diners, by their own admis- sions, to be the most generous tippers of the lot. . . . The finding may be based on their own accounts, figures, numbers, reports, re- sponses, statements, statistics, or words. But it is not based on their own “admis- sions,” because being a generous tipper is not usually considered something to be ashamed of, at least in American soci- ety. 2. ADMISSION and ADMITTANCE Now for the kind of admission that does have to do with entry: it is the act or fact of being allowed to enter, the right to enter, or, loosely, a charge for en- tering. In the sense of entry, admittance is similar. It too means the act or fact of be- ing allowed to enter or the right to enter. However, admittance usually is limited to literal entry into a specific place. (“A locked gate prevented our admittance to the garden.” / “Admittance to the kitchen is restricted to employees.”) Admission often has the added impli- cation of a privileged entry, as into a group, a profession, or a place of enter- tainment. (“Your admission to the soci- ety has been approved.” / “What is the cost of admission to the show?”) More- over, admission may be used figuratively. (“The judge permitted the admission of her testimony.”) For both nouns, the usual adjective is admissible, meaning able to be accepted or admitted. (“Hearsay generally is not admissible evidence.” / “Only those with tickets are admissible.”) Admittable is rare. See also ADMIT. ADMIT. 1. “ADMIT TO.” 2. Han- dled without care. 1. “ADMIT TO” A main headline in a California news- paper identifies a politician who “Quits Senate, Admits to Corruption.” And an Oregon newspaper reports on a broker in trouble: “. . . he denied today ever ad- mitting to the $ 18 , 619 in missing funds.” Admit, when used in the sense of ac- knowledge or confess, should not be fol- lowed by “to.” English idiom allows admits wrongdoing or admitting a mis- take but not “admits to” or “admitting to” an action. (Just omitting the “to” will not rescue the second sample. He denied admitting, not “the $ 18 , 619 ,” 8 admission 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 8"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"but the disappearance of it. Or he denied admitting that $ 18 , 619 was missing. ) Admit to is proper when the meaning is to permit one to enter a group or pro- fession: “She was admitted to the club” or “The state admits to the bar only those who pass the examination.” Admit to is correct also in the sense of permit- ting physical entrance: “The gate admits to the house.” / “The guards will not ad- mit to the plant anyone lacking proper identification.” 2. Handled without care One of the meanings of admit is to confess wrongdoing. The word is so commonly used in that sense that it must be handled with care when a more neu- tral use is intended. Admit (as a transi- tive verb) can mean also to concede the truth of a trivial allegation or to ac- knowledge a shortcoming that is quite innocent: “I admit I’ve been slow to an- swer my mail lately, but I’ve been busy.” The word tempts headline writers by its brevity and can mislead them and their readers. A headline read, “Mon- toya Admits Forgeries.” It seemed to say a U.S. senator had confessed crimes, but the text said something much different: While acknowledging that a campaign finance report of his filed in New Mex- ico bore false signatures of two cam- paign officers, he said he was shocked to learn of it. A safer headline—perhaps “Forgeries ‘Shock’ Montoya”—would have avoided the incriminating juxtapo- sition. See also ADMISSION; CONFESS. ADMITTANCE. See ADMISSION, 2. ADOPT and ADAPT; ADOPTED and ADOPTIVE. See ADAPT and ADOPT. “ADULT.” See EXOTIC. Adverbs. See Adjectives and adverbs. ADVERSE and AVERSE. See Con- fusing Pairs. ADVICE and ADVISE. Advice is the noun, meaning an opinion on what to do about a problem. “I’m going to the lawyer for advice.” Advise is the verb, meaning to recommend or to give ad- vice. “The lawyer will advise me.” All that is common knowledge, is it not? Maybe not. A sign in a window of- fers “TAROT CARD READINGS BY MISS GLORIA” and “ADVISE ON ALL PROBLEMS.” (One problem is her name. A sign on a wall calls her “ Mrs. Gloria.”) Some authorities object to the use of advise to mean inform, notify, say, state, or tell. It is common in business— “Please advise which model is de- sired”—and can suggest business jargon when used elsewhere. One who advises is either an adviser or an advisor. The press customarily in- sists on the e spelling. The o spelling is in line with the adjective advisory, which is spelled only that way. ADVOCATE. The verb advocate means to recommend or promote (a cause). It is a transitive verb only. That is, it must transmit its action to an ob- ject. You advocate something. It was misused in these press quota- tions: “Herlihy . . . has been advocating for the name change. . . .” / “The new or- ganization . . . is advocating for a one- year moratorium. . . .” Omit each “for.” The man “has been advocating the name change.” The group “is advocating a one-year moratorium.” If “advocating” were changed, say, to arguing, pleading, pressing, or pushing, both quoted sentences could accept for. All four verbs are intransitive (not need- ing an object) as well as transitive. One can also argue an issue, plead a case, press charges, or push a broom. A policeman used advocate unid- iomatically in another way: “They advo- advocate 9 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 9"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"cated other people to violate the law.” He may have been thinking of another word: “They encouraged other people to violate the law.” An advocate (noun) is one who pro- motes a cause or who pleads someone’s cause, perhaps as an attorney. “The sen- ator is an advocate of lower taxes.” / “She acted as his advocate at the hear- ing.” As a verb, advocate is pronounced AD-vuh-kate. As a noun, it may be pro- nounced the same way, but more often it is pronounced AD-vuh-kit. AFFECT and EFFECT. 1. AFFECT: the more common verb. 2. EFFECT: the noun to remember. 1. AFFECT: the more common verb To affect is to influence or make a change in (something). A newspaper ar- ticle used the wrong verb: It [the Senate] is also a position of power, an opportunity to effect one’s world. A senator can affect the world, not “ef- fect” it. Similarly, “effecting” should be affect- ing in this sentence, from an editorial in another paper: Until these cases are resolved, suspi- cion will hang over the White House like a noxious plume, effecting every- thing that goes on beneath. [Watch out for noxious feathers!] Another meaning of the a verb is to feign or give the appearance of (some- thing). For example: “Actors ably affect accents.” To effect is to bring about, carry out, or accomplish (something). Example of the e verb: “Each executive effected economies.” It is used much less often than the other verb. Instead of “affect,” this headline should have used effect: “How to affect a peaceful overthrow.” 2. EFFECT: the noun to remember As nouns, the two words are easier to choose between. You will probably want to use effect, the result of a cause. Affect refers to emotion or feeling. Only psychologists seem to have affec- tion for affect. It is pronounced with em- phasis on the first syllable, unlike the other noun and the two verbs. In both of these press examples, “af- fect” should be effect: Texaco Inc. has announced a deal that seems certain to set off a major debate in the United States about its affect on energy security. . . . The Justices Are People[;] Climate of Their Era May Have an Affect Another newspaper got both the noun and the verb wrong in the same article: . . . It’s not clear what affect the nomi- nations will have on the polls. . . . “The PRI has tried to effect social policy by driving away poor fami- lies. . . .” Change “affect” to effect and change “effect” to affect. See also IMPACT. AFTER. After (preposition) is some- times replaced by subsequent to, a correct but pretentious synonym. “Sub- sequent to dinner” is no improvement over “after dinner.” The modest after is a useful word on all levels of English, though sometimes overused. After (conjunction) is a well-worn tool of the press, used to string episodes together in reverse chronological order. As shown by the newspaper excerpt be- low, the word is not limited to one use per sentence. A state supreme court af- firmed a robber’s conviction, finding that 10 affect and effect 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 10"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"a revolver taken from his car without a search warrant was valid evidence. C—— is serving a five-year sen- tence after pleading no contest to the charge that he robbed a gas station mini-market in Long Beach, after brandishing a revolver. [ See BRAN- DISH. ] The sentence is overstuffed with ideas and its double after runs the sequence of events backward. Better: “C—— had used the revolver to rob a gas station mini-market in Long Beach. Charged with the robbery, he pleaded no contest and received a five-year sentence, which he now serves.” Some authorities prefer after to fol- lowing (as a preposition): “He spoke af- ter [not “following”] dinner.” One grammarian accepts that use of follow- ing only when the two events are related by more than time: “Following the riot in Union Square yesterday, six men will appear in Circuit Court today.” See also CONDITION, 1. AGGRAVATE. To aggravate is to make an undesirable condition worse; for instance, “A chill aggravates the flu.” An aggravation is ( 1 ) a worsening of that condition, or ( 2 ) the thing that makes it worse. A trouble or burden, not a per- son, is aggravated. The extracts, from three metropolitan newspapers, illustrate none of those meanings, only the loose use of the words to signify annoy(ance), vex- (ation), stir(ring) up, or the like. Such use is common in colloquial speech and ca- sual writing; it is out of place in more formal media. The measures apparently were cali- brated to be harsh enough to undercut pressure from Congress for additional sanctions but not so harsh as to aggra- vate Beijing into a deep breach in the Chinese-American relationship. . . . The gas men returned in the nick of time, but the aggravation led the Brooklyn woman to ponder the frag- ile dependency of modern life. Usually when world leaders make state visits, the local population is un- interested at best, or perhaps slightly aggravated by the inconveniences, such as rerouted traffic and disrupted schedules at the airport. The first could have used provoke; the second, annoyance, irritation, or vexa- tion; the third, annoyed, irritated, or vexed. AGORAPHOBIA. See HOMO- PHOBIA. Agreement in number.

Why “ain’t”? Was it humor of some kind or verbal slumming? Is not or isn’t or is no would have fit the sentence and spared the writer the appearance of ig- norance. “ain’t” 11 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 11"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The same questions may be addressed to the scientific author who titled a chap- ter “Black Holes Ain’t So Black.” His reason for avoiding the proper Are Not or Aren’t is equally obscure. The American Heritage Dictionary has called the word “beyond rehabilita- tion.” Only 1 to 6 percent of its usage panel ( 105 – 166 members) has approved of its serious use in writing; 16 to 19 per- cent, in speech. Merriam-Webster has viewed it differ- ently: The word is “used orally in most parts of the U.S. by many cultivated speakers. . . .” That comment in Web- ster’s Third New International Dictio- nary provoked ridicule; one wag wondered “where Webster cultivated those speakers.” “Ain’t” is common in the most casual of colloquial speech as a substitute for am not, are not, is not, have not and has not. It may be suitable for writing when the writer is quoting someone or simu- lating spoken slang. It appears in many songs, like “It Ain’t Necessarily So.” “Say it ain’t so” (plus a name) has be- come a cliché. Its legendary origin in a boy’s challenge to an arrested baseball player is well known. So when a newspa- per corrected the expression in a head- line—“Say it isn’t so, Joe” (about a football star’s lawsuit against another newspaper)—it looked wrong. See also “AREN’T I?” ALIBI. Alibi is a legal term. It is a de- fense in which a defendant contends or tries to prove that he was somewhere else than at the scene of a crime when it was committed. In Latin, the word’s source, alibi means elsewhere. An alibi may be truthful or not, as any other type of defense may be. Unfortunately, that noun has come to be used conversationally to signify an excuse for a misdeed, often an excuse that rouses suspicion or is downright spurious. Outside of the legal commu- nity, the popular misuse casts a shadow on the legitimate use of the word. An associate of a peace foundation recommended that Washington outline criteria for Russian admission to the In- ternational Monetary Fund to “offer the Government some alibi for unpopular austerity measures.” Change “alibi” to excuse or justification. ALIVE. See LIVE, 1. ALLEGED, ALLEGEDLY. See AC- CUSED, ALLEGED (etc.). ALL NEW. The bombardment for generations by “new” products, “new” services, and “new” entertainment may have desensitized the public to novelty. Now many advertisers and TV networks seem to feel that anything new has to be announced as “ all new” just to get any- one’s attention. So on four networks we hear these an- nouncements: “the all-new Mazda truck” / “an all-new ‘Simpsons’ ” / “the all-new Mitsubishi Galant” / “Herbie’s back with an all-new adventure.” The items are not brand-new in all respects. Each is just a new model or new episode, but evidently the writers of the commer- cials do not consider that new enough. ALLOT. See LOT. ALL READY. See ALL TOGETHER and ALTOGETHER (etc.). ALL RIGHT. Many people seem un- aware that all right is composed of two simple words, all and right. The phrase is frequently misspelled, sometimes as “allright” but usually in this manner: “Henry took a turn for the worse al- right.” Putting it in a quotation (that one was in a medical book for the layman) does not 12 alibi 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 12"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"absolve a writer. And the fact that some permissive dictionaries condone the mis- spelling is no excuse as long as it is widely viewed as a sign of ignorance. All was not right with Henry. The in- tended meaning there was certainly. That is the meaning in the odd sentence below (another quotation, this one in a leading newspaper). “Virginia has made history, alright, all right, but race is still very much some- thing that has to be contended with.” Perhaps an editor inserted the right ver- sion but forgot to delete the wrong one. In addition to that meaning and the literal meaning of entirely right, all right embraces a variety of other, more or less informal meanings: adequate, agreeable, correct, good, O.K., permissible, safe, satisfactory, uninjured, well, yes. It is both an adjective and an adverb. It should be placed after the word it modifies. “This restaurant is all right.” Placed before the noun—“This is an all- right restaurant”—it becomes slang. “Alright” may have been hatched by analogy with already. But “alright” and all right have the same meanings and the same pronunciations; the two syllables get about equal stress. Already and all ready, however, have different meanings and different pronunciations. Already stresses the first syllable, whereas all ready gives the first and second syllables even stress. See also ALL TOGETHER and ALTOGETHER, -READY, -MOST. ALL THAT. See Anachronism, 4; THAT, ALL THAT. ALL-TIME RECORD. See RECORD. ALL TOGETHER and ALTO- GETHER, -READY, -MOST. An author erroneously wrote that people “came altogether” instead of “came all together. ” All together (adjective phrase) means in a group: “At last our family is all to- gether. ” Altogether (adverb) means en- tirely, all told, or on the whole: “The rumor is altogether false.” / “Altogether 107 were present.” / “How was the show altogether?” Similarly all ready, meaning com- pletely prepared (“The group is all ready to go”), differs from already, meaning by this or that time (“but the plane has al- ready taken off”). An editor dictated a letter that should have said, “Your comments are all most heartening.” Instead of all most, his sec- retary typed “almost,” suggesting that the addressee’s comments were not quite heartening.

Placement. 3. Synonyms. 4. Wrong use. 1. Adverb, not conjunction Also, an adverb, should not be forced to do the work of a conjunction, or con- nector—at least in writing. That is the consensus of grammatical authorities. For instance: “He carries nickels, dimes, and quarters, also half-dollars.” Tacking on an afterthought to a written sentence in that manner is considered juvenile. Af- terthoughts in impromptu speech cannot be helped. Some of those authorities object to starting a sentence with also: “I was run- ning to escape the rain. Also I didn’t want to be late for work.” Better: “I was running to escape the rain and also to get also 13 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 13"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"to work on time.” The “also” could even be omitted. To start a sentence with also is a jour- nalistic peculiarity. This is typical: “Also named were. . . .” A more idiomatic start might be: “ Others named were. . . .” 2. Placement The placement of also, like that of some other adverbs, can substantially af- fect the meaning of a sentence. These two sample sentences are the same ex- cept for the location of also: • “He was also charged with theft.” (It was one of multiple charges against him.) • “He also was charged with theft.” (He as well as another person was charged with that offense.) The misguided belief that compound verbs may not be split sometimes leads a writer or editor to choose the second form when the first is right. A news agency reported a prison sentence for a man paid to influence an attorney gen- eral. The next paragraph: E. Robert ———, a legal consultant for Wedtech, also was fined $ 250 , 000 for misrepresenting the funds he re- ceived from the company. Inasmuch as no one else was fined $ 250 , 000 , make it “was also fined . . .” A quotation from a magazine illus- trates the opposite error: The new Central Park Zoo will also have an underwater window to see their polar bears. Also would have been in the right place if the magazine’s previous sentence had described other features planned for the new zoo. Actually that sentence de- scribes an underwater window to see po- lar bears at a zoo in another city. “The new Central Park Zoo also will have” one. (The sample has another fault: “their” should be its. See Pronouns, 2B. ) See also Adjectives and adverbs, 2. 3. Synonyms Too, likewise, in addition, and besides are synonyms for also and can be more precise at times. But use one at a time. Warning of the danger of winds’ knocking over trees, a city park official said redundantly, “Nature’s pretty but it’s also dangerous too.” The sentence can take either also or too but not both. 4. Wrong use A different misuse of also, as well as other faults, is illustrated by this passage (dispatched by a news agency two years before the collapse of the U.S.S.R.): The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee says Soviet Presi- dent Mikhail S. Gorbachev appears to be carrying out his pledge to make sizeable cuts in Soviet Forces in East- ern Europe. But Rep. Les. Aspin, D-Wis., added that Soviet forces have also increased artillery strength in Eastern Europe. If the first of the two sentences told of, say, increased infantry strength, “also in- creased” would pass muster. As it stands, only artillery is increased, so “also” makes no sense. By “also,” the writer may have meant at the same time. That is not what also means. See 3. The passage illustrates another jour- nalistic peculiarity: The first sentence mentions “The chairman” and the sec- ond sentence mentions “Aspin,” but nothing ties the two together.

A computer book says, in explaining a desktop publishing program, “The total amount of hyphens appearing in one paragraph can also be determined.” “Amount” should be number. The following colloquy helps to explain the use of the two words. “How much are lemons?” “A dollar a pound.” (The amount of money.) “How many are in a pound?” “Four or five.” (The number of items.) “How much fruit will I need for half a gallon of lemonade?” “About a pound.” (The amount of fruit.) Use amount when you are interested in “how much”—how much money, fruit, labor, or anything else. It pertains to a singular noun. Use number when you are interested in “how many”—how many lemons, people, hyphens, or other items. It per- tains to a plural noun. A.M., P.M., NOON, MIDNIGHT. “The shoot-out took place right after 2 A.M. this morning,” a newscaster an- nounced redundantly. In his sentence, “A.M.” and “morn- ing” meant the same thing: the period from immediately after midnight to im- mediately before noon. He could have said “right after 2 A.M. today” or “right after 2 o’clock this morning.” A.M. stands for the Latin phrase ante meridiem, meaning before noon. An En- glish adjective with the same meaning is antemeridian. P.M. stands for the Latin phrase post meridiem, meaning the same as the En- glish adjective postmeridian: after noon. It represents the period from immedi- a.m., p.m., noon, midnight 15 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 15"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"ately after noon to immediately before midnight. In referring to the stroke of 12 , you can say 12 noon or 12 midnight, or just noon or midnight. To avoid confusion, do not abbreviate. Sometimes “ 12 M.” (meridian) is used for noon and “ 12 P.M.” for midnight. But the “M.” can be misinterpreted as an abbreviation of “midnight” and people may not know what to make of the “P.M.” Midnight ends a day. So “midnight Wednesday” is the end of Wednesday, not the beginning of Thursday. A.M. and P.M. are spelled also with lower-case letters (a.m., p.m. or a.m., p.m. ) or small capitals ( A . M ., P . M .). AN. See A and AN. Anachronism. 1. Historical revision. 2. Illogical captions. 3. Retroactive reti- tling. 4. Untrue dialogue. 1. Historical revision In 1867 Secretary of State William H. Seward signed a treaty “to purchase Alaska from the Soviet Union”—at least that is what the hostess on a national ra- dio show said ( 111 years later). Various commentators have called Seward ahead of his time; he would have had to be fifty years ahead to deal with the Soviet Union, which came into existence in 1917 . The treaty was with Russia. That is an example of an anachro- nism, a verbal or graphic misplacement in time, a chronological error. Chronol- ogy shares with anachronism the root khronos, Greek for time. ( Ana- means backward. ) Sometimes anachronism is used erroneously in place of anomaly or contradiction, but time is the key. We are concerned here mainly with the distortion of history by the intrusion of things that came later, particularly names, terms, and expressions. Anachro- nisms are inevitable in fiction represent- ing the future: 1984 turned out differently from 1984 (a fact that does not detract from the eminence of Or- well’s book). An almanac anachronistically stated that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was “founded in 1862 .” It was so named in 1953 as a new identity for the Bureau of Internal Revenue. A television interviewee said Al Capone, the gangster, was arrested for “IRS violations.” Make it tax violations. Capone died in 1947 . This statement was made in a TV doc- umentary about the search for the miss- ing link by archaeologists in Africa: Tools were first recognized by Louis Leakey, when he came to this remote corner of Tanzania in 1931 . Leakey went to Tanganyika. Tanzania was formed in 1964 (from the union of Tanganyika and Zanzibar). 2. Illogical captions Captions of photographs published in the popular press are apt to juxtapose past and present illogically, as this cap- tion in a Sunday paper does: UNDER THE GAZE of a mannequin Saturday, Steve C—— . . . tries sal- mon sausage . . . at the Pittsburg Seafood Festival, which continues to- day. “Saturday,” yesterday, he “tries” it? “Tries” should be tried. The writer has forced upon the present tense the impos- sible task of representing the past as well as the present (the festival “continues to- day”). Having set an action in the past, a sentence cannot bring in the present tense to represent that action. To write that “strawberries await buyers Thursday at Whole Foods market . . .” would normally imply that buyers could expect them next Thursday. But the quotation is the caption of a picture taken yesterday, Thursday, and pub- 16 an 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 16"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"lished today, Friday. It should have ( 1 ) left out the day, or ( 2 ) said “strawberries awaited buyers Thursday . . . ,” or ( 3 ) said “strawberries are pictured [or “ are shown ”] awaiting buyers Thursday. . . .” Then the present tense would not be forced into a role it could not fulfill. See also Tense for discussion of the proper and improper mixing of time ele- ments. 3. Retroactive retitling This sentence was attributed to a news service: Time magazine reported Sunday that independent counsel Donald Smaltz is investigating a charge made by a for- mer pilot for Tyson Foods that he helped convey cash payments from the company to President Clinton while Clinton was governor of Arkansas. Impossible. No “payments from the company to President Clinton” could have been made while he was governor of Arkansas. He held those offices at two different times. Change “President” to Bill. Anyone who does not know that Bill Clinton was elected president would not be likely to read the story. One could speak also of now President Clinton, al- though such use of now, as an adjective, is uncommon. (The allegation has not been proved. The statement involves sev- eral layers of hearsay.) See also FOR- MER. 4. Untrue dialogue In portrayals of historical eras on tele- vision, the dialogue is liable to contain expressions that did not come into vogue until later. Sometimes loose grammar of the future is thrust into characters’ mouths. By a decade or two, three series por- traying the past anticipated such con- temporary expressions as “That’s for sure” / “Give me a break” / “I don’t be- lieve this” / “I love it!” / “We’re [or “I’m”] out of here” / “all that” (“She wasn’t here all that long. . . . I didn’t think it was all that serious”). AND. 1. Excess. 2. Lack. 1. Excess Among pedagogic rules that went too far was the one that forbade anyone to start a sentence with And. Few if any pupils thought to say, “But the Bible does it.” An occasional use of And to begin a sentence can be beneficial: It can associ- ate that sentence with a related one when putting them together in one sen- tence would be unwieldy. There is less justification for starting a paragraph with And. The purpose of a new paragraph is to separate its idea from what preceded. But on rare occa- sions such use of And may be warranted as a stylistic device. Some journalists seem to be reacting vigorously to that pedantic shall-not by going to the other extreme: And the trend toward greater special- ization . . . also adds to costs. And Dr. Sidney Wolfe says costs rise because patients do not have to worry about the bills—the govern- ment and insurance companies do it for them. And Wolfe cautions that with more doctors now owning a share in new testing equipment, there is an increas- ing incentive for them to order extra tests. And the number of physicians clearly is growing. All of the four quoted sentences—three of which start paragraphs—come from and 17 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 17"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"one newspaper story. One in every seven sentences begins with “And.” 2. Lack And (a conjunction: it connects words, phrases, etc.) can mean also, in addition, plus, together with, and as a result. Sometimes and is incorrectly re- placed by “but” or “plus.” See BUT, 1; PLUS. Having more than one and in a series, or enumeration, is not wrong and may be necessary. An irrational avoidance of and results in a common mistake. See Se- ries errors. AND THAT, AND WHICH, AND WHO. See THAT, 3; WHICH, 3; WHO, 2. ANECDOTE and ANTIDOTE. An anecdote is a short, often amusing, account of an incident. An antidote is a medicinal substance that counteracts a poison. (Both words are Greek in origin. The first is from anekdotos, unpub- lished, from an-, not; ek-, out; and dotos, given. The second is from antido- tos, antidote, from anti-, against, and the same dotos. ) Occasionally the two words are mixed up. This dialogue was said to have taken place in a university class: [Instructor:] If a person gets poi- soned, what do you do? [Coed:] Give him an anecdote. Laughter may be a good medicine, but you can carry it too far. ANNIVERSARY. One television newscaster said of Romania, “This weekend is the six-month anniversary of the revolution.” Another said the Czechs “were marking the one-month anniver- sary of the bloody police crackdown.” From a book: “As the unprecedented prior restraint reached its two-week an- niversary ....” They all spoke nonsense. Anniversary stems from the Latin anniversarius, which means returning yearly. The pre- fix, anni-, originated in annus, year, out of which developed the English words annual and annuity. The suffix, -versary, came from the Latin vertere, to turn. So an anniversary is the yearly return of the date of an event, or an observance or celebration of the event on that date in a later year. “Today is the tenth an- niversary of” an event is enough. “Ten- year anniversary,” as some are saying, is redundant. A lesser period than a year may be commemorated in other ways: “It is six months since . . .” or “one month since . . .” or “As two weeks passed since the unprecedented prior restraint was imposed. . . .” If enough people deem it important to commemorate an event of a recent month, possibly a new word would be useful. I nominate lunaversary. It allows us to say, “Today is the first [or sixth] lu- naversary of” the given event. The prefix is from luna, Latin for moon. Two-week commemorations are not common. ANOTHER. Another (adjective and pronoun) is paradoxical, at times em- phasizing similarity, at other times em- phasizing difference. It can mean ( 1 ) one more of the same kind (“I’ll have an- other portion”) or ( 2 ) one that is differ- ent (“They speak another language”). Sometimes it can suggest ( 3 ) resem- blance (“This city is becoming another Manhattan”) or ( 4 ) variations on a theme (“We’ve had one problem after another”). Although a flexible word, it is not a general substitute for additional, more, or others. Some question its use with un- equal numbers. It is correct to say, “We’re giving a $ 100 bonus to Betty and another $ 100 to Charlie.” Another em- phasizes the likeness. What is question- able is a use like this: “The Yanks scored four runs in the first inning and another 18 and that, and which, and who 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 18"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"three runs in the second.” The “an- other” serves no function there but would be useful if the Yanks scored “an- other four. ” Make it “and three runs in the second” or, for emphasis, “and three more runs in the second.” “Another” does serve to prevent am- biguity in this sentence: “Five people were treated at the hospital and another three were admitted”; but a better phras- ing is “and three others were admitted.” This sentence, from a book about the English language, has more than one de- fect: The number of words in use with full entries in the OED is 171 , 476 , plus another 47 , 156 which are obsolete. Omit “another”; the second number does not match the first. Nor does the second category match the first: The 47 , 156 words are not part of “The num- ber of words in use.” This is a possible revision (with the appropriate parallels and pronouns): “The number of words with full entries in the OED is 218 , 632 , comprising 171 , 476 words that are in use plus 47 , 156 words that are obso- lete.” A related problem concerns other. “Of eleven men questioned, five were charged with gambling and the other six were cleared.” The first set does not have six, so it is not technically right to speak of “the other six.” The six others would be proper. Better yet, just delete “the other.” See also NOTHER. ANTE- and ANTI- prefixes. See Homophones. Antecedent. See Pronouns, 1; THIS, 2; WHICH, 1; WHO, 3. ANTICIPATE. The Latin verb antici- pare means to take action beforehand. That is the primary meaning of its En- glish offspring anticipate (verb, transi- tive). It is to act in advance of an event, either to forestall it or to meet it with the appropriate preparation. “He is a great chess player and anticipates his oppo- nent’s moves long in advance.” / “They anticipated the crash by selling most of their stocks.” Usually, however, it serves merely as a fancy, four-syllable synonym for expect. “We anticipate visiting our in-laws this holiday.” So common has that use been, it may not be easy to tell if someone is using the word loosely or strictly. U.S. Attorney William ——— said here last night he anticipates dropping the local case and deferring the prose- cution to San Diego. Does it simply mean he expects to do those things? Or does it mean that he is making the necessary preparations? An- ticipate is a wounded word. (Another trouble with the sample is the shift in tense: “said [past] he anticipates [pre- sent].” See Tense, 2. ) ANTIDOTE and ANECDOTE. See ANECDOTE and ANTIDOTE. ANXIOUS. To be anxious is primar- ily to feel anxiety or anxiousness; that is, apprehension, concern, foreboding, or uneasiness of mind. “I’m anxious about the verdict.” / “The people are anxious for the war to end.” / “She’s anxious to get the test over with.” This adjective comes barely changed from the Latin anxius, meaning distressed. The word often is watered down, par- ticularly in informal conversation, so that the main idea behind it—the anxi- ety—is lost. “I’m anxious to see the Yan- kees play,” Joe tells his friend. Pleasant, not worrisome, anticipation, is all that his “anxious” implies. He might find ea- ger, the pedagogue’s alternative, too fancy for him. One of these, however, should express his meaning and keep him grammatical to anyone’s satisfac- anxious 19 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 19"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"tion: “I can hardly wait to see” / “I want very much to see” / “I’m excited about seeing” / “I’m keen on seeing” / “I’m looking forward to seeing. . . .” Although the use of anxious in those carefree senses is widespread in collo- quial speech, authorities are divided as to its propriety. One who is writing has more resources and less cause to take lib- erties with the word than conversing friends have. A book says: There is a tendency among Euro- peans to romanticise the nomads, which I was anxious to avoid. There was no cause for anxiety. The au- thor could write what he wanted. If he did not want to romanticize the nomads (or romantici s e them, using the British spelling), he did not have to do so. In- stead of anxious, one of these phrases would have served him well: “deter- mined to avoid” / “eager to avoid” / “hoping to avoid” / “inclined to avoid” / “seeking to avoid” / “desirous of avoid- ing” / “intent on avoiding.” ANY. 1. In general. 2. With BODY or ONE. 3. With MORE. 4. With PLACE. 5. With TIME. 6. With WAY. 1. In general It is a mistake to think that any must always be joined to body, one, place, time, or way whenever the two words appear next to each other. In general, any- combined with the other element stresses just the any in meaning and speech; as separate words, both get stress, in meaning and speech. Any and more should not always be joined either, even though more is stressed in anymore. Each pair will be considered in the sections below. Anyhow, anything, and anywhere are invariably single words. Anywhere should have no s attached. “Anywheres” is substandard. Any and all, as in “Any and all viola- tors will be prosecuted,” is legalese and redundant. Pick any or all— or neither. Sometimes any is wrongly used in a comparison, such as “The Acme widget has more features than any widget on the market.” Any other. As it stands, Acme illogically remains in the same class as all the others; other would set it apart. The use of any with a superlative, e.g., “the biggest ears of any animal,” bothers some critics, who would prefer “of all animals. ” Others defend the expression as idiomatic and established. You may choose. Any as an adjective has these mean- ings: one, of several, no matter which one (“Any brand will do”); some (“Have you any mangoes?”); even a bit of (“I don’t have any wool left”); and every (“Any child knows that”). Any can be an adverb, meaning at all (“I can’t make it any tighter”). When it does not precede a comparative adjective (“It can’t hurt any”), it is regarded as in- formal. Furthermore, any can be an indefinite pronoun (“I don’t have any of those books”). As a pronoun, any may be con- strued either as singular, in the sense of any one (“ Is any of these pictures to your liking?”); or as plural, in the sense of some (“ Are any of them for sale?”). See also Double negative; ONE as pronoun, 3. 2. With BODY or ONE Anybody and anyone have the same meaning. As a single word, each is a pro- noun meaning any person. “Anybody [or “anyone”] can do it.” / “Does any- one [or “anybody”] have a knife?” The choice depends on personal preference. If rhythm or conciseness matters, the ad- ditional syllable and letter in anybody can make a difference. In the pronuncia- tion of either word, the first syllable is stressed. 20 any 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 20"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Occasionally the adjective any is sepa- rate from the noun, body or one. Any and body are kept separate when both words are important and both are stressed when spoken, as in mentions of any (human) body or any body of water. Any and one are kept separate when the meaning is any single thing or person and both words are stressed when spo- ken: “Pick any one.” / “Any one of them can do the job alone.” Some critics consider it unreasonable to combine a superlative with anyone in an expression of this order: “He is the smartest person of anyone I know.” They would replace anyone with all or omit “of anyone.” Others consider the combination a time-honored idiom. It is your decision. See also ONE as pronoun, 3; Pro- nouns, 2C. 3. With MORE The writers of these sentences wrongly connected any and more: “If I never get anymore, I’m happy,” she says, explaining her fear of be- coming an obsessed collector. ...T ravis said, “Come ON, Dad, we’re not gonna see anymore trees, are we?” You cannot go wrong keeping any and more separate. Some authorities in- sist on any more in all uses. When any more means an indefinite additional amount, degree, or number (serving as an adjective)—the meaning in the sentences above—its words must be kept separate. When it concerns time (serving as an adverb)—when it suggests from now on, since a certain time, or now—it is either anymore or any more. Then it goes in a more or less negative statement (“He promised not to do it anymore ” or “ any more ” / “I hardly go there anymore ” or “ any more ”) or a question (“Do you visit her anymore? ” or “ any more? ”). And note that it always ends a thought. In some regions “any more” is used colloquially in positive statements as a synonym for now. An example comes from a radio talk show, whose host asked, “Has the ——— Church gotten so out of touch with reality that it’s just a big joke any more?” Sometimes it even starts a sentence: “Any more we don’t see them.” Such uses are not standard. 4. With PLACE An architectural critic was quoted as saying, “I’d never seen anyplace so beau- tiful” (as San Francisco in the forties). It should be: “I’d never seen any place so beautiful.” ( Any serves as an adjective, place as a noun.) As one word, anyplace (adverb) means at, in, or to any place. It shares that meaning with anywhere, although anyplace is more informal. Some author- ities scorn anyplace or any place used as an adverb. Insofar as anyplace is acceptable, it is interchangeable with anywhere, as in the sentence “I’ll go anyplace for a good job.” You cannot substitute anywhere for “anyplace” in the opening quotation. 5. With TIME Any time is preferably used as two words. The one-word form has not gained general acceptance. A critic writes, “The one-word anytime is non- existent in the English language”; yet dictionaries list it: “ adv . at any time.” Britain does not use anytime . Street signs say, “No Parking Any- time.” Telephone books say, “You can call it [an information line] anytime.” Those uses can pass; but any time or, strictly, at any time is better, allowing time due emphasis. As a rule, anytime is tolerable when at any time can be sub- stituted. any 21 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 21"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The words unquestionably must be kept detached in this sentence: “I can’t find any time for my hobby nowadays.” There any serves as an adjective; time is the noun that it modifies. The single word must be an adverb. 6. With WAY As a word (adverb) anyway means nevertheless or in any event. “Aware of the risks, they embarked on the expedi- tion anyway.” / “He probably didn’t do it, and anyway there’s no law against it.” As a phrase (adjective and noun), any way means in some manner, no matter which. “Make the repair any way you can.” (Some dictionaries confusedly give such a definition for the single word.) Anyway should have no s attached. “Anyways” is substandard. APE and MONKEY. When a movie character calls a chimpanzee “bad mon- key!” and a pair of movie reviewers re- peatedly refer to it as a “monkey,” someone ought to speak up for the de- graded creature. Let it be said here that a chimpanzee is not a “monkey.” It is an ape, one of the great apes at that. Apes do not have tails; monkeys do. Apes have more complex brains and can stand and walk nearly upright. They are our closest relatives in the animal kingdom. Other great apes (family Pongidae ) are the bonobo, gorilla, and orangutan. The gibbon and siamang are lesser (smaller) apes (family Hylobaeidae ). The so-called Celebes black ape and Barbary ape (of Gibraltar) are really macaque monkeys, misnamed in the be- lief that they lacked tails; their tails are tiny. Both ape and monkey belong to the order Primates; so do the lemur and man. The designation of all nonhuman primates as “monkeys” is a hoary collo- quialism; note the sobriquet of the Scopes (“Monkey”) Trial of 1925 . See also PRIMATES. Apophasis. See Verbal unmention- ables. Apostrophe. See Punctuation, 1. APPARENT, APPARENTLY. Ap- parent (adjective) has two nearly contra- dictory meanings. It can mean open to view (“The damage to the building was immediately apparent”) or obvious (“It is apparent from these figures that our fi- nancial situation is perilous”). The word can also mean seeming, based on ap- pearance but not necessarily so. (“The apparent art treasure has turned out to be a fake.”) Dictionary definitions of apparently (adverb) include plainly or obviously, but now its most common meaning is seemingly. (“The magician apparently sawed a woman in half.”) News media use apparent or appar- ently often. Its purpose is not always ap- parent. This is from a nine-sentence news story: Two men were apparently killed in separate shooting incidents, one oc- curring Tuesday night and the other Wednesday morning. . . . A driver had apparently lost control and crashed his vehicle. . . . Police are investigating the apparent homicide. “Apparently killed” is absurd. If the “apparently” was meant to apply to something else (“separate” or “shoot- ing”?), it was misplaced. (Incidentally, “one occurring” and “the other” are un- necessary.) The other “apparently” and “apparent” are acceptable. “Apparently” was misplaced and mis- leading in another story: Tenant power apparently defeated Proposition E, which would have lifted rent controls. . . . “Apparently defeated” implies doubt that the proposition was defeated. Per- 22 ape and monkey 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 22"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"haps this was meant: “What appeared to be tenant power defeated Proposition E. . . .” A police chief and a victim of a purse snatcher both died “of an apparent heart attack.” Such journalistic use of the word has been called ambiguous. It could signify that the diagnosis was ob- vious; that the fatal ailment merely gave the appearance of being a heart attack; or that a heart attack was evidently, probably, or possibly the cause of death. Evident or evidently applies to that which facts point to. It stresses evidence, whereas apparent or apparently stresses appearances. Probable or probably ap- plies to that which is likely to be true; possible or possibly, to that which may or may not be true. A news service reported that William Colby, a former CIA director, was “miss- ing and presumed drowned in an appar- ent boating accident” in Maryland. That he had gone canoeing on a river would have been a more accurate detail than a conjecture about an accident, even though qualified by “apparent.” After the body was found, a medical examiner determined that Colby had drowned fol- lowing a heart attack. APPENDIX. See Plurals and singu- lars. Apposition, appositive. See Nouns, 1; OR. APPRAISE and APPRISE. To ap- praise is to evaluate or estimate as to worth or quality. “The house was ap- praised at a million dollars.” To apprise is to inform or notify. Of- ten of follows. “We must apprise the president of this news.” A woman said in a television inter- view about her divorce, “I was not ap- praised that our marriage was having some rocky points.” A man calling a ra- dio advice program said, “He was dying and I never was appraised of this.” The word needed in each instance was ap- prised. APT. See LIABLE. “AREN’T I?” This expression enters casual remarks and profound writings alike: “. . . Porter said with a grin, ‘I guess I am a little detail-oriented, aren’t I?’ ” / “Aren’t I equally determined by the grand unified theory?” Many people who never would say “ain’t I?” are drawn to “aren’t I?” To point up the absurd character of that genteelism, let us turn the phrase around, making a declarative sentence out of it: “I aren’t.” Or let us expand the contraction: “Are I not?” In the declara- tive form: “I are not.” In short, I and are do not mix. Until the widely maligned “ain’t” ac- quires respectability or amn’t (a contrac- tion of am not, used colloquially in Scotland and Ireland) gains general ac- ceptance, our best recourse may be the phrase am I not?— and what is wrong with that? “I guess I am a little detail-oriented, am I not? ” “ Am I not equally determined by the grand unified theory?” See also “AIN’T.” ARGUE. See ADVOCATE. AROMA. An editorial complains about panhandlers at rail stations: Some obstruct the passageways; others are ag- gressive. “And sometimes in the halls and entrances there is the aroma of hu- man waste.” “Aroma” does not describe what the writer is talking about. An aroma is a good smell. It may be spicy or pungent, but it is never bad. Any of four other words could have been chosen: Smell and odor can be good or bad or neither.

While Wan is not seriously ill and cut short a U.S. trip for political and not medical reasons, as was stated last week, he too is said to be receiving medical treatment, for a heart condi- tion. We are forced into a guessing game. What “was stated”: ( 1 ) everything be- fore “as,” ( 2 ) that Wan “cut short a U.S. trip for political and not medical rea- sons,” or ( 3 ) “medical reasons”? (The third choice seems the most plausible, but “medical reasons” and “was stated” do not go together.) And who “stated” it: ( 1 ) someone in a foreign government, ( 2 ) the writer, or ( 3 ) somebody else? The best repair for such a defective sentence is rewriting. Put each idea into a separate sentence. A possible revision follows. (We are guessing what the facts are.) Wan too is said to be receiving medical treatment, for a heart condi- tion. Last week a spokesman in the Chinese government stated that Wan had cut short a U.S. trip for medical reasons. Actually the reasons were po- litical. Wan is not seriously ill. “As was,” seen in the initial sample, is a form that looks artificial and invites ambiguity. So is any phrase combining as and a misplaced verb, like “as are” or “as did.” A news story described a pro- gram drafted by an African political party. It refers to the party as the vanguard “of the Mozambique people” rather than “the worker-peasant alliance” as did the program approved at the pre- vious party congress. The previous program “did” what? “Did” does not hook up with any verb. Perhaps the writer was trying to reuse “refers,” but “did refers” would not be grammatical.” Here is first-aid: “. . . as the program approved at the previous party congress referred to it. ” That would still leave a double use of “as” and a complex sentence. Again we turn to the two-sentence solution. The quoted sentence could end with “people.” A sec- ond sentence could read as follows: The program approved at the previ- ous party congress called Frelimo [the party’s short name] “the worker- peasant alliance.” It can be uncertain whether as is in- tended to mean because or at the same time that: “As the rain began falling, I went inside.” Rephrasing is needed, e.g., 24 around 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 24"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"“The rain began falling, so I went in- side” (cause); or “I went inside just as the rain began falling” (time). ( As is used as a conjunction in the ex- amples above. It is also classified as an adverb, pronoun, and preposition.) 2. Excessive use A mere two letters long, as is a workhorse in the press. In journalese it is a favorite conjunction for stringing to- gether ideas, related or unrelated. News- paper writers do not restrict themselves to just one as per sentence: The assessment was borne out by youthful protesters today as they sur- veyed wrecked banks as plumes of cobalt-blue tear-gas smoke rose in the narrow streets. Why does everything need to be packed into one sentence? Try chopping the sen- tence in two. The assessment was borne out by youthful protesters today. They sur- veyed wrecked banks as. . . . The message becomes less unwieldy. (Let us pretend that we know what “The as- sessment” is.) 3. Lack of a pair One as is usually not enough when a sentence likens two things in a simile or contrasts them in a comparison. Idiom calls for an as . . . as pair: “as happy as a lark” or “twice as high as last year’s price.” A television newscaster told what re- searchers knew about left-handedness: They do know that men are three times as likely to be left-handers than women. “As . . . than” is wrong. A correction: “. . . men are three times as likely as women to be left-handers.” It replaces “than” with as and moves those being compared closer together. Several words must sometimes sepa- rate the first as and the second. This is from another TV program: Costs of health plans are climbing nearly twice as much at midsized companies than at larger companies. Change “than” to as. (The sentence needs more fixing. Just what it means to climb twice as “much” is unclear. Fast or high, depending on the facts, would be clearer.) See also THAN, 2A. Another problem is the faulty “as . . . or . . . than” construction. It is il- lustrated by a business executive’s re- mark that the decisions made by workers can be “as good or better than” the decisions made by management. The necessary second as is missing: “as good as or better than. . . .” It may be clearer to put the or phrase at the end of the sen- tence: “as good as the decisions made by management, or better. ” Another possi- ble correction: “at least as good as. . . . ” Similarly, a history book says: The new law would permit the com- pany to send its tea directly to Amer- ica from India, and sell it at a tax of but three cents a pound, making this American potable as cheap, or cheaper, than smuggled tea. The sentence can be fixed in either of two ways: ( 1 ) “as cheap as smuggled tea or cheaper”; ( 2 ) “as cheap as or cheaper than smuggled tea.” (All of the commas except the second one are unnecessary. Commas are acceptable in this way: “as cheap as, or cheaper than, smuggled tea.”) The examples above each lacked the second as of the as . . . as pair. In the ex- ample below, the first as is missing. It may be hard to imagine Walken—often as not a slick villain in as 25 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 25"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"his movie roles—tromping around in farmer’s boots and overalls. Change the phrase in dashes to “ as often as not. . . .” The sentence appeared in a newspaper’s television review. Was the omission of a two-letter word meant to save space? Plenty of it remained at the end of the paragraph. Sometimes the as . . . as pattern is copied when it is not needed: “As hot as it was, I shivered.” The opening “As” is unnecessary (and archaic). There is no simile or comparison here. The second as means though. “As best as” is not a legitimate form. See AS BEST. A personal pronoun following as . . . as can be subjective or objective: “He is as big as I ” (that is, as big as I am ). But “They pay Sam as much as me ” (that is, as much as they pay me). See also Pronouns, 10E. A sentence may need only a single as if one of the two things being compared came up in a previous sentence. “It sells for $ 1 , 500 . The competing product is twice as expensive” or “just as expen- sive.” Just as appears to be the model for redundancies in the press like “equally as speedy.” Equally speedy would be correct. 4. With NOT In a negative comparison, switching to so . . . as is an option. You can say ei- ther “Charles is not as tall as his sister” or “Charles is not so tall as his sister.” A few grammarians prefer the latter form. A construction that can be confusing goes as follows: “The line-item veto is not an economy device, as a number of reformers think.” Do they think it is or it is not? Literally the sentence is express- ing the negative, but that may not be the intended meaning. Similarly, a lexicogra- pher writes: ...Orm had not used unntill (as the editors of the work and of the OED believed) but its northern variant inn- till. . . . Literally the parenthetical clause says the editors believed the negative, although the context suggests the reverse. A clearer wording would be “the editors . . . believed that he had done so.” (What follows “but” does not make grammatical sense. Either add a verb, e.g., “but had used its northern variant,” or place “not” after “used.” See BUT, 6. ) This was stated in a news broadcast on a radio network: The VA considers alcoholism willful misconduct, not a disease, as most of the medical profession does. “Does” ties in with nothing; but since the only other verb in the sentence is “considers,” the second clause seems to say that most of the medical profes- sion also considers alcoholism willful misconduct. An opposite message may have been intended, although there was no explanation. Whatever the message was should have been in a separate sen- tence. 5. With WELL The phrase as well as has primarily meant and not only. Though forced to bear the extra sense of and in addition, it has not fully adapted itself to that role. Classified as a conjunction, it is consider- ably weaker than the conjunction and. This is an example of its distinctive use: “Gertrude, as well as I, is going to the meeting” (not “are” going or “am” going). The number of the verb remains singular, and the person of the verb con- forms to the main subject. As well as im- plies the addition of a new fact (that Gertrude is going) to a fact already known (that I am going). A dictionary’s sole example is “skill- ful as well as strong,” which illustrates the newer use, that of simple addition. 26 as 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 26"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The phrase becomes merely a drawn- out replacement for and. Sometimes one cannot tell which meaning was in- tended. When as well as is put between two verbs, the verb form is the same. In this sentence, from a biography, one word could well be changed: In the three days they covered at least fifty miles as well as climbing two mountains of around 3000 feet. To match covered, change “climbing” to climbed. Besides would go with climb- ing. The grammarian H. W. Fowler took it on himself to “come to the rescue of the phrase as well as [a conjunction] . . . be- ing cruelly treated” like the preposition besides. Among examples: “His death leaves a gap as well as creating a by- election in Ross”—make “creating” cre- ates, or replace “as well as” with besides. “You were there as well as me”—make “me” I. Both should not go with as well as. See BOTH, 2. As well, without the second as, can mean in addition (“He wins the money and a car as well”) or with similar effect (“We might as well give up”). It should not open a sentence, as it did on the ra- dio: “As well we’ve got another [road] closure.” Although unnecessary, “as well” would have been more idiomatic at the end of the sentence. AS and LIKE. 1. Confusion. 2. In- comparability. 1. Confusion Like is proper in this sentence: “Sometimes I feel like a motherless child.” Or this one: “He looks like you.” It conforms to the rule: Like (a preposi- tion) may be followed by a noun or pro- noun that is not allied to a verb. As (a conjunction) introduces a clause, a group of words with a subject and verb. Like is not acceptable in these sen- tences, from radio and daily press: Tonight it will cool off, like it al- ways does. Like they did last week before the Assembly Judiciary Committee, judges were expected yesterday to ask for a delay in legislative action. . . . He looked like he had put on some of the weight he had lost. In the first and second of the three sam- ples, change “like” to as. In the third, change “like” to as if or as though. The “like”—after “likes”—looks even worse in the sample below, from a book. Change “like” to as. At other times, he likes to produce spectacular effects, like when he puts an imposing beret made of crumpled paper onto his picture of The Student with a Pipe. . . . Sometimes when like is needed, people who have become afraid of it substitute “as.” Comprehension can suffer: “Harold, as his brother, appeared in a movie.” If the message is that both were in movies, not that Harold portrayed his brother, change “as” to like. One may reasonably take issue with the rule, on grounds of literary history. Shakespeare and other celebrated, long- gone writers did not avoid like with verb. Nor do most people in colloquial speech. Some authorities defend such us- age. But after generations of insistence by grammarians, editors, and teachers, a writer or careful speaker today emulates Shakespeare et al. at the risk of having his literacy questioned. 2. Incomparability Simply following the rule will not res- cue an error in logic. When you liken as and like 27 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 27"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"one thing to another, they must be com- parable.

AS BEST. “As best as could be deter- mined, no dailies failed to print . . .” (from a report on a flood, in a magazine for the newspaper industry). “As best as” should be removed from one’s vocabulary. No superlative, such as best, longest, happiest, or bravest, belongs in the as . . . as form. A phrase like “as brave as a lion” expresses the degree of a quality, but a superlative per se expresses that; the degree is the highest. No one would say, “He was as bravest as a lion.” The sample could well begin “ As far as ” (and, to be still more idiomatic, “ it could be determined” or “ anyone could determine . . . ”). The error typically appears in this form: “She painted as best as she could.” It can be corrected in any of three ways: ( 1 ) change “best” to well; ( 2 ) change “as best as” to the best; “She painted the best she could”; ( 3 ) omit the second “as”: “She painted as best she could.” The single as there means in the manner that (she could paint best).

ASSURE, ENSURE, and INSURE. 1. The differences. 2. More about AS- SURE. 1. The differences To assure is to make (someone) sure of something, to give confidence, or to promise confidently. Usually the word is directed at people, not things; and it im- plies the use mainly of words, not deeds, to set one’s mind at rest. “We assured them of our support for this worthy cause.” To insure is to make (something) sure or certain, to guarantee, to make safe or secure, to protect (against), or to agree to pay money in the event of loss. Usually this word is directed at things, not people; and it implies deeds, rather than mere words, to make something certain or secure. “We must observe our budget strictly to insure that we stay solvent.” Except in the sense of indemnify, when insure is the only verb to use (“The company insures my property against fire” or, intransitively, “The company in- sures against fire”), ensure has the same meaning as insure and usually is pro- nounced the same (in-SURE). The spelling of ensure is less common. The British prefer ensure in every sense except the financial, but almost no American authorities insist on such discrimination. The related nouns are assurance and insurance. Again, it is a matter of words and deeds. “You have our assurance that 28 as best 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 28"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"the product is safe.” / “The scrupulous testing we do is the best insurance of our product’s safety.” Life assurance is a term traditionally used by British insurance companies. Life insurance is the American term, notwith- standing the Equitable Life Assurance So- ciety of the United States, whose archaic name insures its distinction. 2. More about ASSURE You assure a person or a group. ( As- sure is a transitive verb). You do not just “assure” in general, contrary to the be- lief of a reporter. This statement is both unidiomatic and misleading: “The Presi- dent had assured the troops would not be sent into the city.” At first it looks as though he “assured the troops” of some- thing. The sentence should have read something like this: “The President had assured the senator that the troops would. . . .” (The journalistic avoidance of that contributed to the trouble.

More than twenty years later, a spokesman for major league baseball said, upon announcing a concession to end a strike, “We are happy to have this done at this point in time.” And a motor vehicles dealer said, in commenting on the settlement of a trade dispute with Japan, “At this point in time we’ve all got a lot more cars than we need.” Before Watergate, they might have used at this time or at this point or, if in- clined toward plainer talk, now or right now or no adverb at all. Just leaving out “at this point in time” would give such messages more punch and not impair them any. Obviously the time is the pre- sent. A variation came from an ex- congressman: “I think at that point in time that I admitted I broke the House rules.” At that time or simply then would be a good replacement. (The sec- ond “that” would make more sense after “think” but could be omitted.) ATTORNEY and LAWYER. “The parents’ lawyer, . . . a Corte Madera at- torney who specializes in suits against school districts said. . . .” The writer has reversed the two terms. The sentence ought to read, “The parents’ attorney, . . . a Corte Madera lawyer who. . . .” Attorney often serves as a pompous synonym for lawyer. In its narrower sense, however, attorney means a person who has been appointed or empowered to act for another in a legal or business matter. One who acts as an attorney is usually—but not necessarily—a lawyer. A lawyer is a person whose profession is the practice of law. Smith, a lawyer, is Brown’s attorney. Brown, a layman, is Smith’s client. Each is an attorney or a client in relation to the other person. Lawyer may be used in the more specific sense too: Smith is Brown’s lawyer. A lawyer in a trial is often spoken of as counsel. “In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the assistance of counsel for his de- fense” (Sixth Amendment, U.S. Consti- tution). Counsel can be singular or plural. The judge in a trial often ad- dresses a lawyer as counselor. See also Titles, 3. Attributive adjective.

Some have the notion that whenever they find the words a and while next to each other, they must stick them together as one word, regardless of meaning. Not so. Awhile means for a period of time. It is an adverb, not what the four samples below need. Each should have been given the indefinite article a with the noun while, meaning a period of time. (Three are from daily newspapers; the fourth is from an annual book for writers.) It was awhile before Mr. Pietsch, who is from Ohio, the son of a minister, en- tirely recovered his sense of humor. “After awhile it becomes easy to know things. . . .” Once in Awhile, First Time Can Be a Charm For most writers it takes awhile to get the knack. Change each “awhile” to a while. For example, let us correct the first sentence: “It was a while before Mr. Pietsch en- tirely recovered his sense of humor.” (What does his Ohio origin or his kin- ship to a minister have to do with his sense of humor? See Modifiers, 2. ) Never write “for awhile.” For is part of the meaning of awhile. Each of the following three samples contains that error. Awhile can stay in each, but not preceded by “for.” (They are by a colum- nist, a news service, and a history book respectively.) Koppel let it slide for awhile, but fi- nally he whacked Bush with it. “So she played the slot machines for awhile, then got a bite to eat.” In Virginia the assembly actually gained the upper hand for awhile. Omit each “for”: e.g., “let it slide awhile.” As an alternative, keep the “for” but sever a and while: “let it slide for a while. ” In the sample below (by an- other columnist) “awhile” cannot stay; make it “For a while. . . . ” For awhile, victory would seem within his grasp. 30 auxiliary verbs (helping verbs) 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 30"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"A while is not often used adverbially, in the manner of the final sample (from another book for writers).

A movie review said, “William Hurt plays Graham Holt, a male spinster who shocks neighbors when he decides to adopt a 10 -year-old.” “Male spinster” is as contradictory as “female bachelor.” A spinster is a female by definition: She is a woman beyond the usual age for marrying who has not been married. (In some contexts, like British law, age is not relevant. Neither is sex on rare occasions: in a primordial use of spinster as a professional spinner of fiber.) The actor described in the movie re- view plays a bachelor. Numerous dictio- naries define bachelor as “an unmarried man.” That definition is incomplete. The word often implies that the man ( 1 ) is of the usual age for marrying, or be- yond, and ( 2 ) has never been married. At least two dictionaries recognize bach- elorette and the synonymous bachelor girl. Of course a college graduate of ei- ther sex may be a bachelor of arts, sci- ence, or some special field. But only a male can be a plain bachelor. One who is unmarried as a result of divorce is a divorcée (woman) or divorcé (man), pronounced dih-vaur-SAY either way. A divorced person, without regard to sex, is a divorcee, pronounced dih- vaur-SEE. One who has been bereaved of a spouse and who has not remarried is either a widow (woman) or a widower (man). Any unmarried status is com- monly called single, although the Bureau of the Census has long defined single as “never married.” BACK(-) prefix and pairs. A news article described a drug trial in Florida and added, “Locally it took a backseat to news of the crack cocaine epidemic in Jacksonville. . . .” When used as a noun, the term back seat consists of two words: “Locally it took a back sea t...” or “The passenger sat in the back seat.” The two words are hyphenated when used as an adjective, usually in back-seat driver. (The article’s joining of the phrase contradicted the newspaper’s own style rule.) The same goes for back room: two words as a noun (“Come into the back room ”), hyphenation as an adjective (“It was a back-room deal”). It has to do with pronunciation. Unifying the words would indicate that the first syllable should be stressed. Actually, each sylla- ble gets about equal stress in back seat, and the same is true for back room. It is also true for the two-word nouns back road and back yard. The latter is often spelled “backyard,” although the noun front yard is always two words. The Associated Press understandably calls for back yard as a noun, backyard as an adjective. In a phrase like backyard barbecue, the stress shifts to the first syl- lable. As nouns, back door and back stairs 32 bachelor and spinster B 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 32"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"give the syllables about equal stress. As adjectives, when each initial syllable is stressed, they become single words: backdoor, backstairs. Both adjectives can mean secret or underhanded, in ad- dition to their literal meanings. The lat- ter has an alternate form: backstair. These twenty nouns are all single words, stressing the first syllable: back- ache, backboard, backbone, backcourt, backdrop, backfield, backfire, back- ground, backhand, backlash, backlog, backpack, backrest, backside, back- space, backspin, backstop, backstroke, backwash, backwater. Backstretch and backwoods, which stress the syllables about equally, are anomalies. Generally either backward or back- wards may be used as an adverb (“The car went backward[s]”), though some press organizations avoid the latter. Only backward serves as an adjective (“a backward glance”). BACK (time). See FORWARD and BACK (time). Backward writing. 1. Looking-glass syndrome. 2. Some causes and cures. 3. “Upcoming”: Germanisms. 1. Looking-glass syndrome Backward run often sentences. Turvy topsy turned are idioms. Reversed are phrases. Journalese is it. The compulsion to write backward is not known to reach such an extreme, ex- cept in Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking Glass, but newspapers from coast to coast are replete with sentences like these: Suspected are cadmium, nickel, cop- per, mercury and hydrocarbons. Affected were eggs, vegetables, sugar and pork—the staple meat in the Chi- nese diet.

Fishing for trout with Baker during the week of the July 18 Democratic conclave in Atlanta will be veteran California political consultant Stu Spencer . . . and Rep. Richard Cheney of Wyoming. The normal sequence of a declarative sentence is ( 1 ) subject, or noun, and ( 2 ) predicate, or verb. All of the samples above reverse the normal sequence. Inversions, as they are called, are nec- essary in questions (“Where am I?”). They suit the Bible (“Blessed are the meek”), poetry (“While follow eyes the steady keel”), and old-style prose (“To the victors belong the spoils”). They are found in exclamations (“How forceful are honest words!”), commands (“Get thee to a nunnery”), and hypothetical clauses (“Had I only known”). An inver- sion can provide a transition between thoughts (“Next comes the matter of fi- nances”), emphasize a negative idea (“Never . . . was so much owed by so many to so few”), and set a scene (“In a village of La Mancha . . . there lived . . .”). Reasonable inversions of other types appear now and then, formed with style, in idiomatic English. The idiom sampled earlier is quintessential journalese. Not only does the sentence structure appear awkward and depart from the standard manner of speech, but also it may shift the emphasis away from that which is most important. In the fourth example, is “Fishing for trout” more significant than the meeting of three politicos? Often the first part of a sentence is a normal quotation, direct or indirect, but the attribution that follows is inverted: “. . . charges a supervisor” / “. . . pointed out Eve” / “. . . explains Bunny.” The backward writing 33 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 33"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"people are not being charged, pointed out, or explained; they are performing the actions. Simple, unambiguous phrases like “said Tom” or “replied Mrs. Green” are tolerable when not overused. 2. Some causes and cures The persistence and ubiquity of in- verted writing may have several causes: perhaps widespread imitation of a Time magazine idiosyncrasy, perhaps a belief that distorting sentences helps to make writing readable. Another explanation is that journalists often see the distorting as the solution to a problem: In a typical case, a reporter has the names and individual details of people caught in a police raid. His problem is to put them in a coherent sentence. Rather than start with a tedious list and end with the words “were booked,” he be- gins with “Booked were” and then gives the list. But he could start with a phrase like Those booked were and not have to contort the sentence at all. Our first two examples can be re- paired easily by preceding “Suspected are” and “Affected were” with short phrases: “ The chemicals suspected [of toxicity] are cadmium, nickel, copper, mercury and hydrocarbons” and “ The foods affected [by price rises] were eggs, vegetables, sugar and pork. . . .” An effort to crowd too much into one sentence is often a factor. Our third quo- tation in section 1 is brief but abridged; the sentence in the newspaper was fifty words long. Instead of putting forty-five words ahead of “is trying for a come- back,” the reporter wrote: “Trying for a comeback is Maurice Ferre, a polished Puerto Rican businessman who. . . .” A better course would be to turn that in- verted structure right-side up and add a sentence: “Former Mayor Maurice Ferre is trying for a comeback. He is a polished Puerto Rican businessman who. . . .” In an article about attitudes toward divorce, a paragraph begins this way: “Comments Marion Solomon, a West- wood therapist and author of. . . .” The title and subtitle of her book and the name of its publisher intervene before we get to read her comment. The re- porter could have written something like “Marion Solomon, therapist and author, comments: . . .” and postponed the de- tails. 3. “Upcoming”: Germanisms Sometimes a simple phrase containing a verb and an adverb is twisted around, joined together, and used in a manner that is more Germanic than English. Ex- amples are “ongoing” and “upcoming” used as verbs in place of going on and coming up. See ONGOING; OUTPUT; PLAY DOWN and DOWNPLAY; UP- COMING. See also “PROOF POSITIVE” —not Germanic but an expression that re- verses the normal positions of adjective and noun. BACTERIA and BACTERIUM. Bacteria is a plural word, denoting two or more of the microscopic, single-celled organisms that cause disease, putrefac- tion, and fermentation. In speaking of just one specimen of those organisms, that is, one cell, use bacterium, the singu- lar. It is New Latin, from the Greek bak- terion, small stick. The excerpts are from a television fea- ture, an article by a news agency, and a statement by a biologist, respectively. One resistant bacteria can become sixteen million in twenty-four hours. It should start: “One resistant bac- terium. ” ...Any met hod that sets the white and causes the yolk to begin to con- geal will kill the bacteria unless it’s present in high numbers. “It’s” should be they’re or they are. 34 bacteria and bacterium 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 34"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"For this bacteria . . . there’s practically no effect on any of them. “For these bacteria . . .” We may also speak of a single strain (or form or colony ) of bacteria: “A new strain of bacteria has caused the out- break of influenza.” BAD and BADLY. A local reporter and a Senate leader made essentially the same mistake on television. The first was following up a crime; the second was de- scribing reaction to a change in the pres- ident’s budget policy: Merchants and residents feel badly about what happened. Some Democrats who want to play politics and not address the issues feel badly. Change “badly” to bad. One who is ill or unhappy feels bad, not “badly.” And people, or things, may look bad, not “badly.” Feel or look (a linking verb) links the person or persons (the subject) to bad (adjective) and is not modified by it. Similarly, one feels sad, not “ sadly. ” Theoretically someone could feel badly if he lost his sense of touch. Then feel (verb) would be modified by badly (adverb). This is more likely: “My foot hurts badly. ” Badly, this time meaning intensely, modifies hurts (verb). To say “My foot hurts bad” would be as un- grammatical as saying “I feel badly.” Ei- ther remark would be enough to make a grammarian or English teacher feel bad. See also FEEL. BAIL and BALE.

Being a trademark, it should not be written in lower case, the way it appears in a book of English instruction for newcomers. In sample dialogue, a pharmacist asks a customer, “Do you need any band- aids?” Capital B, capital A. Competitors call their products adhesive bandages. BASE and BASS. See Homophones. BATHROOM. Calling a room with no facility for baths a “bathroom” is not a serious shortcoming. It is common in conversational speech, less so in the press: The mother of two young sons, she usually finds herself having to take them into the women’s public bath- room while shopping. The east wing will be radically al- tered and will contain two movie the- aters, . . . bathrooms and a coat check room, among other conveniences. But bathroom is more specifically ap- plied to the type of room that contains a bathtub or shower or both, a sink, and a toilet. The public place that everyone seeks at some time is often called a rest room (although few go there to rest) or a men’s or ladies’ room (less often a gentlemen’s or women’s room ). The ladies’ room is also a powder room. Even though frankness, if not vulgar- ity, generally abounds these days in the media of mass communication, Ameri- cans remain squeamish in referring to that type of room. Our standard terms are all euphemistic. In American culture, unlike the con- vention in some other cultures, it is not considered refined to call the public room a “toilet.” But it is proper to use toilet in speaking of the plumbing device as such. Toilet itself used to be a eu- phemism. It once meant dressing table. bathroom 35 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 35"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Some use lavatory, literally a washing place.

Who is talking? 1. Ambiguity Because needs to be handled with care in a sentence containing more than one idea. Take this sentence, from a newspa- per: Only 20 percent of Californians would vote to re-elect Senator Alan Cranston because of his involvement in the Lincoln Savings and Loan scan- dal, a new California Poll shows. It could be interpreted as saying that only 20 percent of Californians would vote for the senator “because of his in- volvement . . .” and that others would do so for other reasons. The context sug- gests that the sentence would be better recast in this way, separating two ideas: A new California Poll shows that only 20 percent of Californians would vote to re-elect Senator Alan Cranston and that his support is so small be- cause of his involvement in the Lin- coln Savings and Loan scandal. The word causes particular confusion af- ter a negative clause. The witness said that the case was not brought before the committee be- cause of the incident the night before. Did the witness testify that as a result of “the incident” the case was not brought before the committee? Or did he deny that “the incident” caused the case to be brought before the committee? We do not know. Another quotation illustrates the haz- ardous use of because after a negative and, secondarily, the ungainly use of be- cause twice in one sentence. In a trade journal for the newspaper industry, an article tells of a British newspaper that increased its circulation by cutting its price. The writer comments: This cheers me up because it sug- gests that circulation is not declining because readers are morons who don’t care. By itself, the sentence is ambiguous. One could rationally interpret it in either of these ways: 1 . The information suggests that circula- tion is not declining, the reason being that readers are morons, who don’t care how bad their newspaper is. Thus I am cheered. 2 . The information suggests this: The reason that circulation is declining is not that readers are morons, who fail to appreciate how good their newspa- per is. I am cheered to know that it is another reason. The context points to the second inter- pretation. (The message is that the indus- try has no control over the intellect of its 36 bazaar and bizarre 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 36"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"readers, but it can control price, quality, and marketing.) Either way, the readers do not come out very well. 2. Incompatible pairs Because is teamed up at times with the wrong partners. “The reason is because” is a redundant partnership. See REA- SON, 1. “Why . . . because” is another. “Why the alarm sounded was because a fire broke out on the ninth floor.” Omit “why” and “was” (“The alarm sounded because a fir e . . .”) or change “because” to that (“Why the alarm sounded was that a fire . . .”). Otherwise it is like say- ing “The reason that . . . was for the rea- son that.” See also REASON, 2. Because normally is a conjunction. It should not be used as though it were a noun, e.g., “Because he’s the boss gives him the right to boss us around.” These are incompatible: “because . . . gives.” Change ( 1 ) “Because he’s” to Being, or ( 2 ) “gives him” to he has, following a comma, or ( 3 ) “Because” to That. 3. Who is talking? The lead paragraph of a newspaper article will follow. Not avowedly an edi- torial, it is identified as “ NEWS ANALY- SIS. ” ZAGREB, Crotia [sic]—In twice bombing Serbian positions around the Muslim enclave of Gorazde, the United States and its Western allies have wagered that force will bring the Serbs back to the negotiating table be- cause force is the one thing Serbian soldiers in Bosnia understand. It is not necessary to delve into the sub- stance of the final clause, introduced by “because.” Some readers will recognize it, recycled from past wars, hot and cold. The point is that the writer, whatever his intention, is expressing that opinion. It is attributed to no one, although later in the article he refers vaguely to “One Ameri- can official” (the one who fed it to him?). The conjunction because means for the reason that, not “on the supposed grounds that.” Unless it is qualified— e.g., “because, in the words of one American official, who refused to be identified”—the writer or speaker is li- able to be stuck with what follows. BED as verb. See CHAIR, 2. BEFRIEND. From its looks, one might assume that the verb befriend means to be friendly with somebody. A book on advertising advises any reader who is confused about scheduling radio spots: “Call the media rep you be- friended in Chapter Three.” That chap- ter discusses dealings with radio salesmen. To befriend is not merely to be friendly with someone or even to be someone’s friend. It is to act as some- one’s friend in time of need. A family that takes in a war refugee is befriending the person. BEGET. It is a poetic verb (transitive), literally meaning to be the father of. It can be used figuratively, meaning to cause something to exist, e.g., “Hunger begets crime.” But do not forget the lit- eral meaning, as a politician did when she wrote in an op-ed essay, “Teenage pregnancies beget teenage pregnancies. Welfare mothers beget welfare moth- ers.” The normal past tense of beget is be- got. An archaic past tense, found in the Bible, is begat. A headline over a letter to the editor erroneously said, “Violence begats more violence.” Begets— there is no “begats.” See also SIRE. BEGIN, BEGAN, and BEGUN. The past tense of the verb begin, to start, is began: “It began to rain.” The past participle is begun: “Construction has begun.” A reputable newspaper used one for begin, began, and begun 37 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 37"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"the other: “The ‘night float’ began in most New York State hospitals as a gru- eling rite of passage ended.” Begun would be right. (Commas or dashes should precede it and follow “passage” to set off the explanatory matter. By the way, “night float” was a thirty-six-hour shift for new doctors.) BELLY. See STOMACH. BEMUSE, BEMUSED. Some writ- ers confuse “bemuse” with amuse. The meanings of the two words are not at all similar now, although they once were. The -muse part of each can be traced to the Medieval Latin word for snout, musum. Bemuse (verb, transitive) means ( 1 ) to daze or muddle someone, or ( 2 ) to cause one to muse or be deep in thought. It may take the form of bemused (past tense and past participle) and bemusing (present participle). Examples: “He blamed the alcohol for bemusing his head.” / “Bemused by his equations, the professor paid no heed to the bell.” Amuse (verb, transitive) now means to entertain or appeal to one’s sense of humor. At one time it meant to beguile or bemuse. An autobiography describes a gen- eral’s reaction to a barroom brawl. Gunfighter must have noticed that several of his officers sported shiners, bruises, and puffed lips. He said noth- ing. But I detected on his seamed face a bemused smile. Could it have been “an amused smile”? Another book of recollections tells of a motor trip in Africa. To get fuel to cross the Sahara, the author willingly de- toured for several days. I thought, bemused, of the times in my pre-Africa life I had fumed and ranted over late planes and traffic jams. Was he really so deep in thought or just amused by the thought? In a similar book, another author re- calls a visit to an oil company’s camp in the Sahara during a choking dust storm. The Europeans working there asked whether we would like showers and then some lunch. Such questions were almost bemusing after weeks in the desert. Later he describes the privation after weeks of desert travel and adds: Then there is a town; and the abun- dance of everything is almost bemus- ing. “Bemusing” fits neither context. Amus- ing fits each. In the excerpt below, from a financial newspaper, the meaning is not clear. “You can’t find anyone to bribe here,” says a bemused American de- veloper, Joseph T——, who is negoti- ating to build a hotel on the Red Sea and apartment blocks in Asmara. The context gives no reason why the de- veloper should be stupefied or en- grossed. Was he amused, confused, surprised—or what? BESIDE and BESIDES. See Confus- ing pairs. BESIDES and AS WELL AS. See AS, 5. BEST. See AS BEST; BETTER and BEST (etc.). BETTER and BEST, WORSE and WORST. The rule is simple, though often disregarded in conversations and by ring announcers who say “May the best man win”: When the merits of two things are compared, one thing is better 38 belly 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 38"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"and one is worse (unless they are equal in merit). Only when there are three or more items for comparison can one be the best and another the worst. Thus these sentences, uttered by a political candidate and by a senator (who used to be a journalist) are wrong: Which of the two candidates for your nomination is best qualified to be president of the United States? The policies of the president are the best of the two [sets of policies]. Correction: “is better qualified” / “are the better of the two.” See also AS BEST; Comparative and superlative degrees. BETWEEN. 1. AMONG and BE- TWEEN. 2. “BETWEEN EACH” or “EVERY.” 3. “BETWEEN . . . OR” or “TO.” 4. “BETWEEN YOU AND I.” 1. AMONG and BETWEEN In school many of us were taught to distinguish between the prepositions be- tween and among: The former applies only to two things, the latter to more than two. That is so in a good many cases. “It was a conversation between Tom and Dick.” / “The two talked only between themselves.” But “It was a con- versation among Tom, Dick, and Harry.” Each converser addressed the other two. The Constitution authorizes Congress “To regulate commerce . . . among the several States. . . .” The rule is too sweeping, however. There are exceptions, and our educators may have considered them too subtle for us. Between applies to three or more things when the relation is essentially be- tween pairs. For instance: “Conferences are going on between Canada, Mexico, and the United States to consider future migration.” That means three separate two-party conferences are taking place. But when “A conference is going on among Canada, Mexico, and the United States,” all three are meeting together. Similarly, one may have many pieces of cheese to sandwich between many slices of bread. The bread slices are con- sidered as pairs. The same sandwich principle permits “He paused between sentences” and “Commercials are broadcast between innings.” (But see 2, below.) Between can refer to the combined possession of two people or other enti- ties. “John and I had fifty dollars be- tween us.” Use among when speaking of three or more. A TV newscaster was talking about three baseball-playing brothers: “Between them the Alou brothers played forty-seven major-league seasons.” Change “between” to among. 2. “BETWEEN EACH” or “EVERY” Although it is fairly common in collo- quial use to pair between with “each” or “every,” it is absurd from a logical standpoint. That such a combination ap- pears occasionally in serious literature does not make it any more sensible. Ex- amples: “He paused between each sen- tence” and “Commercials are broadcast between every inning.” Something cannot be “between” one thing. Between generally applies to two, sometimes to more than two. Each and every are singular words, meaning one of a group considered individually. In the examples, change each “between” to af- ter; or follow “each sentence” or “every inning” with and the next; or use plural forms ( see 1, above). 3. “BETWEEN . . . OR” or “TO” When between is followed by two specified things, only and can connect them. Sometimes between is combined with “or,” pitting a dual word and a sin- gular word: “It’s a choice between right or wrong.” Right and wrong, or else a choice of. The words choose, decide, and decision also lead people astray. From goes with to, just as between between 39 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 39"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"goes with and. Sometimes those idioms are carelessly confused. “Between 10 to 15 percent of the population is believed to be affected by the disease.” Either change “Between” to From or change “to” to and. A variation of that error is to use “between” with an en dash: “He ruled between 664 – 600 B . C .” Make it “ from 664 to 600 B . C .” Merely changing the dash to and would correct the gram- mar but leave the meaning uncertain. ( See also Punctuation, 4C. ) 4. “BETWEEN YOU AND I” In speaking confidentially, no one is likely to say “between I and you.” The common version, with the pronouns switched around, is essentially the same mistake, a form of overrefinement. As the object of a preposition, any personal pronoun following between must be in the objective case: between you and me; between him and her; between us and them. ( You can be either subjective or objective.) See also Prepositions, 1; Pro- nouns, 10. BEVY. A bevy of quail is a hunter’s term for a flock of those birds. This noun is also applied to larks, roe deer, and some other groups. It may once have meant a drinking group, after the Old French noun bevee, an act of drinking. Writers habitually mate bevy with the phrase “of beauties” in picture captions and television continuities pertaining to displays of young females. In two install- ments of an entertainment news series, co-hosts (female and male) referred to “this year’s bevy of beauties” at the Miss Universe pageant and said “James Bond’s back with a bevy of beauties.” BI- and SEMI- prefixes. The prefix bi- indicates two, double, or twice, de- pending on the word it begins. It comes from the Latin bis, meaning twice, and is used in that very form as a musical in- struction. Bi- is part of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Some are general words: bicycle, a pedal vehicle with two wheels; bifurcate, to separate into two parts or branches; bilingual, pertaining to two languages. Some are technical: bicuspid, having two points, and a tooth of that sort; bifocal, having two different focal lengths, and a lens ground that way; bi- valve, having two hinged shells, and a mollusk of that sort. The chief problems with bi- lie in des- ignations of frequency. Bimonthly (ad- jective and adverb) means appearing or taking place every two months. A bi- monthly is a periodical published every two months. Biweekly means appearing or taking place every two weeks. A bi- weekly is a fortnightly, a periodical pub- lished every two weeks. Semimonthly is twice a month; semi- weekly, twice a week. At times “bi-” words have been used instead. “Loosely,” said The Random House Dictionary, first edition. “Nonstandard” was the label in The American Heritage Dictionary, first edition. Later editions of those dictionaries and Webster’s Third contain no such labels. By including among their definitions of bimonthly and biweekly “twice a month” and “twice a week” without qualification, they foster confusion. “The ambiguous usage is con- fusing,” The Oxford English Dictionary says. It offers semi-monthly, semi-weekly, etc. (preferring hyphenated forms). Biennial (adjective) means taking place every two years or lasting two years. Biennially (adverb) is every two years. A biennium (noun) is a two-year period. Twice a year is semiannual(ly) or semiyearly. ( The Oxford gives half- yearly. ) Two other bi- words related to year cause confusion and could well be aban- doned: biannual, which is commonly de- fined as twice a year; and biyearly, which is sometimes defined as every two years and sometimes as twice a year (depend- ing on the dictionary). All this can be perplexing.

While it may seem verbally expensive to speak of, say, “the meeting that is held every two years” instead of just “the bi- ennial [or “biyearly”] meeting,” it avoids misunderstanding. Similarly, a bi- weekly or bimonthly does well to ex- plain that it is published “every two weeks” or “every two months.” Semi-, as in “the semiannual meet- ing,” should not cause any problem in the context of time. Latin for half, semi- can mean half ( semicircle, semiquaver ) as well as twice during a given period. More often it means partly ( semiauto- matic, semiclassical ). BIBLE.

Big time is a colloquial noun for the highest status in any busi- ness, occupation, or competitive field: “My athletic friend has made the big time.” The phrase came out of vaude- ville, where it denoted performances in the big cities, which offered relatively high pay for few performances. A related adjective, big-time, means successful or important or pertaining to the big time: “That contractor is a big- time operator.” In recent years it has become a faddish phrase, used in still another way: as an adverb. The lead paragraph of a newspa- per’s main story, about police powers, said: As fear of crime continues to grip the public mind, there’s new evidence that a key tactic of the get-tough-on- crime campaign is paying off—big time. What does “time” contribute to the sen- tence, except the superfluous message that the writer knows the latest slang? Not a fragment of information would have been lost if he had saved a word (and an unnecessary dash) and written: “. . . a key tactic . . . is paying off big.” Better yet: “. . . a key tactic . . . is paying off.” The same expression, hyphenated, ap- peared in a banner headline about the success of a young Hollywood per- former: “Actor’s success now flowing big-time.” The use of the word “flow- ing” is understandable in view of the ac- tor’s then latest film, A River Runs Through It. One might expect the stream image to continue; for example, “Actor’s success now flowing in torrent. ” To introduce instead that ex- pression from the vaudeville stage is al- most to mix metaphors. BIKE, BIKER. Bike is primarily a col- loquial shortening of bicycle, meaning (noun) the pedal-operated, two-wheeled vehicle or (verb, intransitive) to ride a bi- cycle. Biker is the corresponding term for bicyclist or bicycler, one who rides a bicycle. As a comparable term, motorcycle and motorbike riders have borrowed bike for either of their motor-driven two- wheelers and biker for one who rides it. A problem arises when someone uses bike (noun or verb) or biker without making it clear which vehicle is meant. A news broadcast told of a gathering of “ 100 , 000 bikers,” repeatedly using that word and never once explaining that they were motorcyclists. Bicyclists may gather in groups too. See NOT TO MENTION for a similar example. BILLIARDS and POOL. The scut- tling of a “plan to locate a pool hall” in a mostly residential neighborhood was summarized in the lead of a newspaper story. The second paragraph said “the billiard parlor would have replaced a neighborhood restaurant.” Loath to re- peat “pool hall,” the reporter chose “bil- liard parlor” as a synonym. billiards and pool 41 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 41"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Many owners of pool halls or pool- rooms, apparently aware of the seamy reputation of those places, prefer the terms “billiards” and “billiard parlor,” even though they may own no billiard tables, only pool tables. Both games use hard balls, rods called cues, and oblong, green-felt-covered tables with raised, cushioned edges. But pool usually has six pockets and sixteen balls, whereas billiards —or three-cushion billiards, the favorite version—has no pockets and three balls. What the industry calls pocket billiards, players call just pool. BILLION. Billion can be ambiguous, especially in the United Kingdom. To Americans, it is a thousand million, or 1 , 000 , 000 , 000 , or 10 9 . It is the unit that congressmen often toss around when discussing the federal budget. But a British billion is traditionally a million million, or 1 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , or 10 12 — what Americans call a trillion. What is called a billion in the United States is a milliard in the United Kingdom. In a book, a cosmologist, physicist, and professor of mathematics presents the theory of inflation in the early uni- verse, “an increase by a factor of at least a billion billion billion. . . .” Later in the book he suggests the possibility of the universe’s “recollapsing in a hundred bil- lion years or so.” The book was pub- lished in the United States by an American publisher for American read- ers, but the author is British and his dis- cussion of the future of the universe is taken from a lecture at the University of Cambridge, England. Unless the book version was edited for American readers, they may not be receiving exactly the in- tended message. Under such confusing circumstances, it is well to specify which billion is meant, for example “a hundred billion (U.K.) years . . .” or “ 1 . 7 billion (U.S.) sales.” Fortunately the particular exam- ple of ambiguity is not critical; a confu- sion between a hundred billion and a hundred trillion years is not likely to af- fect life on earth to any measurable ex- tent. The earliest use of billion quoted in The Oxford English Dictionary was by John Locke, 1690 . The dictionary says that billion, trillion, and quadrillion were purposely formed in the previous century to denote the second, third, and fourth powers of a million respectively. French arithmeticians later redefined the words so that billion represented a thou- sand million, trillion a thousand thou- sand million, and so on. In the nineteenth century, the United States adopted the French system, and in 1948 France adopted the British system. In later decades there has been a trend to- ward use of the U.S. values in Britain, es- pecially in technical writing. See also NANO- prefix. BIT. See MUCH. BIZARRE and BAZAAR. See Ho- mophones.

Blame ON and blame FOR The moving of industrial plants to Mexico is “a factor Democrats blame on the nation’s unemployment,” in the words of a local television newscaster. He got it backward. Nobody says U.S. unemployment causes plants to move to Mexico. You blame something for an ill. But you blame an ill on something, or, as an alternative, place the blame for the ill on something. (Something or someone, that is.) Thus, “The moving of plants to Mex- ico is a factor Democrats blame for the nation’s unemployment.” Or they “ blame the nation’s unemployment in part on the moving of plants”; 42 billion 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 42"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"or they “ place some blame for the na- tion’s unemployment on the moving of plants. . . . ” (Changing “the nation’s un- employment” to unemployment in the United States would clarify the identity of the nation.) A few critics do not want the verb blame to be followed by on. They com- plain that a construction like “He blames the disease on an insect” mis- places the blame. They would approve of “blames the insect for . . .” or “puts [or “places”] the blame for the disease on. . . .” Only 18 percent of the usage panel of The American Heritage Dictio- nary objected to the blame . . . on con- struction. It is doubtful that anyone would misunderstand a sentence like “Don’t blame it on me.” 2. BLAME or CREDIT? To blame is to place responsibility for a fault or a mistake, not for something good or laudable. This was said on a medical talk show: Asian women have the lowest rate of cancer in the world and we have blamed it on their lower fat consump- tion. Change “blamed it on” to credited it to or attributed it to. See also CREDIT; THANK, THANKS. BLITZKRIEG. Blitzkrieg is a Ger- man word adopted by English. It means lightning war, from blitz, meaning light- ning, and krieg, meaning war. It was used by Hitler to describe a sudden, mas- sive attack, designed to conquer a coun- try swiftly. It can also denote a sudden, swift, massive attack of a nonmilitary nature. Seeking an exciting noun, a writer chose blitzkrieg for a story in a metropolitan newspaper. Was she right? But in his 18 years of defending the industry, Walker Merryman has never seen anything like the current blitz- krieg against cigarettes and people who smoke them. She was grammatically correct but factu- ally incorrect. The story described sev- eral, separate antismoking actions that had taken place within several weeks: enactment of laws by states and cities, bans by restaurant chains, and federal measures. The “blitzkrieg” later became a mere “assault” and still later just a “movement” that “appears to have gathered momentum in recent weeks.” Furthermore, “it has been several years in the making and is the result of a com- plex set of pressures and events.” So it could not veritably be described as a lightning war, however metaphorically. BLOC and BLOCK. A book dealing with Britain’s acquisition of destroyers from the United States in 1940 quotes the minutes of Churchill’s war cabinet in this way: It might well prove to be the first step in constituting an Anglo-Saxon block or indeed a decisive point in history. Did those minutes (which, presumably, indirectly quoted Prime Minister Churchill) actually read “Anglo-Saxon block”? Bloc was then and is now the normal spelling of the word in the sense of a group of nations, parties, legislators, or individuals of different loyalties allied in a common cause. In politics of conti- nental Europe, a bloc is a group of polit- ical parties that support the ruling government. The k and no -k versions of the word are used interchangeably in the phrase bloc vote or block vote. It has two mean- ings: ( 1 ) the vote of a substantial number of people voting as a group; ( 2 ) a method of voting at a convention or con- ference in which a delegate’s vote is weighted according to the number of bloc and block 43 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 43"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"members he represents. In dozens of other senses (as noun and verb), the word is spelled only block. BLOND and BLONDE. Yellowish, golden, or flaxen hair is blond (adjective) when it is used in a general sense or per- tains to a male, blonde (adjective) when it pertains to a female. A man or boy with blond hair is a blond (noun); a woman or girl with blonde hair is a blonde (noun). Among four people advertising in the “Personals” one day for companions of opposite sex, two men identified them- selves as 40 , 6 ′ 1 ′′ , blonde hair, blue eyed, slen- der. . . . ...T all, trim, attractive blonde, 32 . The other two were women who identi- fied themselves as SWF, 26 / Slim, blue-eyed blond. . . . Petite blond, big brown eyes, 40 s. . . . Each of the four used the wrong gender. Apropos to the genders of hair words: brown hair is brunet (adjective) in a gen- eral sense or pertaining to a male, brunette (adjective) pertaining to a fe- male. A male with brunet hair is a brunet (noun); a female with brunette hair is a brunette (noun). As adjectives, blond and brunet are often used for females. “BLOW YOUR MIND.” This ex- pression is a relic of the hippie era. Re- cent examples follow. [A promotion for a TV drama:] Their dreams will blow your mind. [A student suffering a disease:] It still kind of blows my mind. [A doctor who saw someone driving while reading:] Does that blow your mind? It certainly blows my mind. Minds are not blown. The expression is overdue for retirement. Substitute a verb like amaze(s), as- tound(s), or overwhelm(s) (you, me, etc.) or, in the example below, an adjective like amazing, astounding, or over- whelming. [An astronomer, on the process of hu- mans’ acquiring extraterrestrial atoms:] I find the process completely mind-blowing. BOIL, BOILED. In dealing with eggs, food writers customarily avoid hard-boiled or soft-boiled, believing that we boil just the water and “cook” the eggs. If the rest of us have any qualms about eggs, they are more likely to con- cern dietary usage than English usage. Hard-boiled egg is a common phrase, which gave rise to the colloquial adjec- tive hard-boiled, meaning tough and cal- lous, applied to a person. A leading cookbook gives instructions for cooking “Soft-Cooked Eggs” and “Medium-Soft-Cooked Eggs” and “Hard-Cooked Eggs.” But it does not avoid boiled beef, boiled potatoes, and New England boiled dinner. “Cooked” is less informative. The verb cook in- cludes all methods of preparing food for eating by the application of heat. Water will boil (verb, intransitive) at 212 degrees Fahrenheit or 100 degrees centigrade; that is, it will reach an agi- tated, bubbling state in which it vapor- izes. A person is said to boil when greatly excited. And to boil (verb, transi- tive) a liquid is to heat it to the boiling point. One can also boil a solid: subject it to the heat of a boiling liquid.

In the fourteenth century, Chaucer wrote in the prologue to The Canterbury Tales: “A Cook they hadde . . . To boille the chiknes [chick- ens] with the marybones [marrow bones]. . . .” Thinking of all those victuals, dare we consider the unappetizing sense of boil (noun) as a skin infection? BORE, BORNE, and BORN. Tw o erroneous substitutes for borne ap- peared in two issues of a newspaper. The 40 -year-old Cambodian woman . . . has bore a child and lived for 10 years here in a thatched hut. . . . “Has bore” is wrong. Make it “has borne. ” Borne is a past participle of the verb bear. The past tense is bore. To use bore in that sample sentence, relocate “has” in this way: “ . . . bore a child and has lived for 10 years here in a thatched hut. . . .” Asked whether the building had ever born any nameplate, Mr. For- manek replied, “No, the secret police have always been very modest.” In the second sample, “born” should be borne. Born also is a past participle of the verb bear but is used only in the sense of given birth and only passively; e.g., “She was born abroad.” A little-used noun that sounds the same is bourn, spelled also bourne. It is ( 1 ) a brook or small stream; ( 2 ) a bound- ary, destination, or realm, used in po- etry: “The undiscover’d country from whose bourn No traveller returns”— Shakespeare, Hamlet. BORN with name. An almanac says “William J. Clinton was born William Jefferson Blythe III in Hope, Ark., on August 19 , 1946 .” Not exactly. He was probably just baby Blythe before being christened William Jefferson. An infant at birth normally has only a surname. See also NEE. BOTH. 1. BOTH . . . AND. 2. BOTH with words of togetherness. 3. Other principles. 1. BOTH . . . AND Sentences that contain both with and are not always constructed as carefully, neatly, and logically as they should be. For instance, the editor of a local weekly wrote: We recently added Elizabeth P—— to our pool of critics—both because we like her writing and her perspec- tive. That is illogical and ungrammatical. Following the “both” there is a clause: “because we like her writing.” One should expect to find a comparable clause after the “and,” for example: “be- cause we agree with her perspective.” In- stead only the phrase “her perspective” appears. The sentence could be corrected also by relocating the “both,” as follows: “because we like both her writing and her perspective.” The main point is that when both is combined with and (forming a pair of correlative conjunctions), what follows one must match grammatically what fol- lows the other. If a clause follows the both, a similar clause must follow the and. A phrase must be paralleled by a similar phrase, a verb by a verb, a noun by a noun. This sentence, from a news story, falls short: Mr. Wan is believed to be caught in a difficult position by the power strug- gle in China. For he is both a close friend of Mr. Deng—sometimes serv- ing as Mr. Deng’s bridge partner—and both 45 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 45"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"is a leading exponent of China’s changes in recent years. Omit either the third “is” or the “both.” 2. BOTH with words of togetherness Both, adjective or pronoun, means the one and the other. For instance (as adjec- tive), “Both buses go downtown,” or (as pronoun) “Both go downtown.” Both indicates that an activity or state that could apply to only one (thing or person) applies to two. Therefore both should usually not go with any descrip- tive word or phrase or any verb that ap- plies only to two or more. Two such words are alike and same. One cannot be alike, and one cannot be the same. In “Both dogs look alike,” change “Both” to The. In “The books are both the same,” delete “both.” Words of that sort include agree, be- tween, equal(ly), joint(ly), meet, and to- gether; phrases include along with, as well as, combined with, each other, and to have in common. It takes two or more to be equal, to be together, and so on. “Both” does not belong in “The brothers have both been united.” In “Both agreed on the wording of the con- tract,” they should replace “Both.” In “I did both my work in addition to his,” change “in addition to” to and. Al- though “both” could be omitted too, it is useful for emphasis. A federal cabinet officer spoke of pay- ments to “both HMOs as well as skilled nursing facilities.” Either do without “both” or change “as well as” to and. 3. Other principles A. BOTH with OF Both often goes with of when a pro- noun follows: “Give me both of them.” You would not say “Give me both them.” But “The referee penalized both them and us” is correct. Otherwise, of is generally optional. A dictionary prefers either “both girls” or “both the girls” to “both of the girls” in formal usage. But “both the girls” might bring to mind “and the boys,” whereas “both of the girls” is unambiguous. B. Possessive constructions Whether both can go with a posses- sive pronoun gets a yes and a no. One authority accepts “both our fathers” (re- ferring to two fathers). Another dislikes “both their mothers,” preferring “the mothers of both”; but the former seems to be an established construction: “a plague on both your houses.” When what is possessed is singular, there is no such disagreement. Of both is often necessary. Either of these will do: “It is the belief of both” or “It is both men’s belief.” These are wrong: “both’s belief” / “both their belief” / “both of their belief.” C. Replacing EACH; errors in number In “Both praised the other,” change “Both” to Each. An alternative wording is “They praised each other.” “I see a bus stop on both sides of the street” erroneously places one stop on two sides. Either change “a bus stop” to bus stops or change “both sides” to each side. D. THE with BOTH Some authorities object to the before both. It is at least unnecessary in “She scorns the both of them” and strained in “The both men were disappointed.” In each instance, either omit “the” or change “both” to two. E. Two only Both applies only to two things, ac- tions, or qualities, not to three or more. In the sentence “He is both tall, dark, and handsome,” leave out “both.” BOUGH and BOW. See Homo- phones.

BRING and TAKE. “Please take this money and claim check to Tom’s Repair Shop and bring me my lamp.” In the sense of physical movement, illustrated by that sentence, the verb bring indicates movement toward the speaker or writer, or toward a place associated with him; the verb take indicates movement away from the speaker or writer, or other movement that is not toward him. It was announced on the radio that a police bomb squad had picked up a sus- picious device and “they’re getting ready to bring it out of the building.” Better: take it out. The movement was not nec- essarily toward the speaker; and anyway, in the sense of physical removal, take out is idiomatic. BROADSIDE. POPLAR BLUFF, Mo.—A Union Pacific train slammed broadside Sun- day into a station wagon driven into the path of the 73 -car train, cutting the automobile in half. . . . The train probably did not slam “broad- side” into the station wagon. Unless it leaves its track, a train is not likely to hit anything “broadside.” Broadside (when used as an adverb, as it is used above) means with a broad side facing a given object; that is, a broad side of whatever is performing the action. If an automobile skids sideway on an icy street and hits a parked truck (any part of the truck), we can say that the car hit the truck broadside. A newspaper turned the word into a hyphenated verb of uncertain meaning: . . . His wife, on her usual biking route, was broad-sided only a few blocks from their Twin Peaks home by a drowsy 20 -year-old running a stop sign. Nothing was said about a motor vehicle. Maybe the 20 -year-old was running. BROKE and BROKEN. See Tense, 5A. BRUTALIZE. The primary meaning of brutalize is to make (a person or ani- mal) brutal or like a brute, an animal. That meaning of the verb (transitive), brutalize 47 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 47"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"from about 1700 , is particularly useful, for it is not duplicated by any other sin- gle word. Another sense of brutalize (transitive), from the latter 1800 s and lately popular, is to treat (one) like a brute or with bru- tality. That use tends to render the word ambiguous. An article said the prison system “brutalizes inmates.” Does the system make inmates brutal or treat them brutally? Even when not ambiguous, the word is apt to serve nowadays as a fuzzy sub- stitute for more informative verbs, such as batter, beat, club, kick, mug, pommel, punch, rape, torture, or whip. Or it be- comes a fashionable replacement for various idioms: An article said “a group of them brutalized [attacked?] the woman jogging through the park.” A movie reviewer commented on TV, “This monster feels himself like a brutal- ized [an abused?] child.” A nearly obsolete sense of the verb (intransitive) is to live or become like a brute. BUCK NAKED. See ON, 3. BUCOLIC. Bucolic (adjective) means rural, pastoral, pertaining to the coun- tryside. Therefore it was redundant for the narrator of a documentary on rail- road travel to say, “As the train nears Portland, the bucolic countryside gives way to signs of civilization.” Either omit “bucolic” or change “countryside” to a word like scenery. See also IDYLLIC. Bullet. See DUM-DUM BULLET; Se- ries errors, 5. BURGEON, BURGEONING. To burgeon is to put forth new buds, leaves, blossoms, etc.; or to begin to grow. Bur- geoning, used as an adjective (“the bur- geoning tree”) means budding or sprouting or putting forth new buds, leaves, blossoms, etc. The verb or adjective may be used fig- uratively or poetically (“The child’s artistic talent burgeoned in kinder- garten”) as long as it refers to that which is newly emerging. Too often burgeon or burgeoning is used loosely instead of in- crease or increasing, expand or expand- ing, or any of numerous synonyms. These two passages (from a syndicated column and an editorial respectively) il- lustrate the loose use: The congressional flag service sprouted in 1937 . . . . By 1955 the de- mand was so heavy that there was a three-year waiting list. This prompted Congress to establish a more elabo- rate system to meet the burgeoning demand. The burgeoning demand for physi- cian services is reflected in a new study. . . . Strictly speaking, if the flag service “sprouted” in 1937 , that is when the de- mand for flags burgeoned; and the de- mand for physician services probably burgeoned thousands of years ago. The next two sentences (from news stories) are ambiguous: . . . The legislation would authorize spending more than $ 1 . 5 billion . . . to provide birth control information in an effort to slow the demand for fossil fuels in burgeoning nations. Hungary is growing adept at focus- ing world attention on its burgeoning refugees. “Burgeoning” could be interpreted ei- ther in the loose way to mean expanding or in a stricter way to mean newly emerging. The latter sentence is doubly troublesome: People do not “burgeon,” except perhaps at birth. BURGLARY.

Question of pronouns. 5. With “HOWEVER” etc. 6. With NOT. 1. BUT or AND? But (as a conjunction) introduces a contrast. Something that was just said will be contradicted or an exception to it will be given. The “but” is unwarranted in this headline bank: Labor got little from Clinton and De- mos, but things look worse now Where is the contrast? Let us assume that labor had got much, instead of “lit- tle.” A but would have been called for. As it stands, what follows the “but” is not very different from what precedes it. Thus the conjunction needed is and. Al- ternatively, replace the comma and “but” with a semicolon: “Demos; things.” Similarly, “but” should be and in this sentence from television news. The part after the “but” offers no contrast, just more of the same. Hong Kong is already one of the most crowded places on the planet, but the population is expected to dou- ble. . . . The opposite error, using “and” in- stead of but, comes from a television in- terview with a woman in public life. As a teacher, she taught girls “never to raise their hands and interrupt.” It seems to mean that she taught them to be quiescent. “And” implies more of what precedes, carrying the negative force of “never” to “interrupt.” How- ever, the context indicates that what she taught them was really the reverse: “never to raise their hands but to inter- rupt.” 2. “BUT THAT”; “BUT WHAT” When a phrase such as “no question but that” or “no doubt but that” is used in place of no question that or no doubt that, “but” is at best unnecessary. At worst, “but” produces a double nega- tive, thereby reversing the meaning of the sentence. On a television talk show, a politician said: There is no question but that we are in serious economic trouble in this country. But can mean except, other than. So if there is no question “but” that we are in serious economic trouble, one can say with logic that the only question is whether we are in serious economic trou- ble. Omitting “but” corrects the sample sentence: “There is no question that we are in serious economic trouble. . . .” “But what” does not improve on “but that.” A member of the press said, in a forum on television: I don’t think there’s any doubt but what Congress will permit the aid to continue. The speaker had no doubt that Congress would approve the aid. Such replace- ment of that with “but what” is unac- ceptable to most authorities (even to some who condone “but that”). See also THAT, 3. 3. Further double negatives But (as an adverb) means only, no more than. A negative should not pre- cede but, used in that sense. In both of these sentences, the “wasn’t” or “won’t” plus the “but” amounts to a double negative: “The child wasn’t but five years old.” / “We won’t have but a day to spend in the city.” If the intended meanings are that the child’s age was only five and we can spend only a day in the city, change the sentences to “The child was but . . .” and “We will have but. . . .” but 49 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 49"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"This sentence is fairly clear: “We can but hope that peace will come soon.” It suggests that we can do no more than hope. This one is ambiguous: “We can- not but hope that peace will come soon.” Is it intended to mean the same as the other sentence—in which case the “-not” is wrong—or does it mean that just hoping is inadequate? See also Double negative. 4. Question of pronouns A tricky question of pronouns arises when but is used to mean except. Do we say that “everyone attended class but she ” or “but her ”? Authorities differ. (Some consider but a preposition, to be followed by a pronoun in the objective case. Others consider but a conjunction that precedes an elliptical clause—e.g., “she did not”—and calls for a pronoun in the subjective case.) A working rule is to make the pro- noun I, we, she, he, or they (subjective case) before the verb; but make it me, us, her, him, or them (objective case) after the verb. Thus “Everyone but she at- tended,” however “Everyone attended but her. ” 5. With “HOWEVER” etc. But can be the equivalent of however, nevertheless, and yet. Normally none of those words should go with but. Some- times carelessness produces a sentence like this: “But we must look ahead to the future, however.” “But . . . however” is redundant. Se- lect one or the other. 6. With NOT “But” is mistakenly used in place of as in an essay: “He was not so much a comic actor . . . but a real comedian.” What we see is not so much a contrast as a comparison. “But” should be dropped from this sentence: “It is not an evergreen . . . ; but its leaves fall in the autumn. . . .” The statements are compatible, not contrast- ing. This is a proper but sentence: “It is not an evergreen but a deciduous tree.” Another defective form goes like this: “They did not get as far as the city but its suburbs.” It is defective because the im- plied clause that follows but lacks the service of a verb. The only verb in the sentence is “did not get,” which does not apply to “its suburbs.” The simplest cor- rection is to insert a verb after but: “but reached its suburbs.” This similarly flawed sentence may be corrected in two ways: “We have not seen the document but the news.” Either place “not” after “seen” or follow the but with a verb: “but have seen the news.” It can be argued that the original sentences are clear enough. Nevertheless, adding balance and logic can strengthen them. See AS, 4, for another illustration. 50 but 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 50"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"CAME.

Thus, “Can you lift this barbell?” asks whether one is physically able to do it. “May I speak?” asks permission; ob- viously anyone orally asking that ques- tion can speak. “You may kiss the bride” gives permission; plainly the bridegroom can do it. In informal conversation, can is often used in place of may, particularly in neg- ative questions or statements. “Why can’t I speak?” / “You can’t” or “You cannot.” When a customer asks a store- keeper, “Can I see that watch?” the lat- ter would do well to say, “Certainly”—not “You can, if you have eyesight.” The writer of “Repair Information” in a telephone directory seemed bewil- dered by the two words, using each twice: If you have a problem with your in- side wiring, you have several repair options: a.

CAPITAL and CAPITOL. An arti- cle called Katmandu “the capitol of Nepal.” Make it capital, not “capitol.” The Capitol is the building in which the Congress of the United States meets. A comparable building in which a state legislature meets is a capitol. A capital is a city or town that serves as the official seat of government of a country, state, or province. A capital, or capital letter, is a large letter like A, B, or C, used to start sentences and proper names. Capital (with no article) is a noun denoting assets, investment money, wealth, or those possessing them; and capital is also an adjective pertaining to those things or meaning fa- tal, first-rate, or foremost. Will this help? O nly o ne building in the United States is the Capitol and o nly o ne building in each state is a capitol— with o in the third syllable.

When it does not ap- ply to investment and the financial kind of capital, the term capitalization con- cerns the use of capital letters in writing and printing. Which words start with capitals (up- per-case letters) and which start with small letters (lower-case letters) has been decided by custom in most instances, al- though differences on many points exist. Questions can often be resolved by a dic- tionary. (But some dictionaries are not helpful. The otherwise authoritative Ox- ford English Dictionary capitalizes all entries. Webster’s Third capitalizes al- most none, running such entries as “kansas city” and “saint patrick’s day” while noting that they are “usu cap”; when are they not? The capitalization scheme for entry titles in our book is de- scribed under General Topics, near the front.) Sometimes one’s personal preference decides, although in the interest of read- ers, it ought not to be followed to an ex- treme. At one extreme is the shunning of all capitals, a quirk of two literary per- sonages of the past; at another is the ar- bitrary capitalization of words for emphasis, which was common centuries back. A condensed excerpt from the Declaration of Independence follows. The first letter of every noun deemed im- portant is a capital. . . . All men are created equal . . . with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.—That to secure these rights, Governments are insti- tuted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the gov- erned,—That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People . . . to institute new Govern- ment . . . to effect their Safety and Happiness. Some current principles of capitaliza- tion follow. 1. Beginning of a sentence. The first letter of every sentence starts with a cap- ital. So does a sentence fragment that stands alone. “Her answer was brief. ‘Yes.’ ” 2. Colon. A sentence fragment follow- ing a colon is not usually capitalized: “I’m eating only three times a day: morning, noon, and night.” Whether to capitalize a complete sentence after a colon is up to each writer or publication. 3. Days, times of the year. Days, months, and holidays are capitalized: Thursday, November, Thanksgiving. Seasons are usually not: winter, summer. 4. Derivatives of names. Most adjec- tives derived from people’s names or other proper nouns are capitalized: Eu- clidean geometry, Georgian architecture, Shakespearean plays, Machiavellian ethics, Roman numerals. Many are not: pasteurized milk, roman type, italic type, french fries, venetian blinds. 5. Heavenly bodies. They are usually capital: Saturn, Milky Way, the star Sir- ius. The Earth and the Sun may be capi- tal in the context of astronomy, small in general contexts: the greatest show on earth; soaking up the sun. 6. Historical events and eras. They are often capitalized: The Industrial Revolu- tion. World War II. But there is disagree- ment; it is “the battle of Hastings” in one work, “The Battle of Hastings” in another. 7. Initialisms and acronyms. Most ini- tialisms and acronyms, such as M.D. and AIDS, are all capitals. Doctor of phi- losophy becomes Ph.D. Abbreviations, like com. for committee and secry. for secretary, do not need capitalizing. 52 capitalization 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 52"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"8. Names. Capitalize the name of a person, city, state, country, business, or- ganization, religion, language, national- ity, specific institution, trademark, or government body: John Brown, Atlanta, South Dakota, Bank of America, Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., Bulgarian, Purdue University, Pepsi-Cola, the Supreme Court. Institutions or groups referred to in a general sense are not usually capital- ized: the medical profession, the middle class. 9. Personification. In poetic usage, common words put in human terms are capitalized: “the lute of Hope . . . the voice of Love . . . the wand of Power.” 10. Press differences. Some newspa- pers will not capitalize the categorical part of names; they will write, for in- stance, “Elm street” and “Washington school.” The press has been getting away from that “down style.” Styles of head- lines vary. Some are like titles, the initial letter of each word capitalized (“Cops Catch Robbers”); others are like ordinary sentences (“Cops catch robbers”); a few are all capitals (“COPS CATCH ROB- BERS”). The Associated Press and many papers following its style do not capital- ize president unless it precedes a name. The New York Times always refers to the U.S. chief executive as President. 11. Quotations. A quotation within a sentence typically starts with a capital when the quotation is set off by some introductory words: “Emerson said, ‘Life is a series of surprises.’ ” When the quotation blends with the rest of the sen- tence, some authorities start the quota- tion with a small letter: “Emerson said that ‘life. . . .’ ” Others insist on a capital if the original text began with a capital: “Emerson said that ‘Life. . . .’ ” All agree that a fragment of the original after the beginning needs no capital when blended with the rest of the sentence: “Emerson called life ‘a series of sur- prises.’ ” 12. Sacred names. The name of God in all its forms—Allah, Jehovah, the Lord—is always capitalized. A deity in a general sense—the Roman god of war— is not. Sacred terms in any religion are capitalized. Modern Bibles do not capi- talize he and his when referring to God. The adjective referring to the Bible may be either Biblical or biblical. 13. Sentence within a sentence. A sen- tence enclosed in parentheses or dashes within another sentence is commonly uncapitalized: “The accusations (remem- ber that he denied them all) were exten- sive and damaging.” Whether to capitalize a question within a sentence is up to the writer: “I thought, Why am I here?” / “I thought, why am I here?” 14. Titles. In the titles of books, shows, works of art, and so on, generally all words are capitalized except articles ( a, an, the ), some conjunctions such as and and short prepositions such as in and of. A small word is capitalized too when it is the first word of the title: Riders of the Purple Sage but The Outline of History and A Little Night Music. Official titles are capitalized before a name (Secretary of State Robert Smith) but not after a name (Robert Smith, sec- retary of state). See also 10. 15. Two words always capitalized. The words I and O (without an h, as in “O God”) are always capitalized. 16. Verse. Traditional verse capitalizes the first word of every line: “We whirl, singing loud, round the gathering sphere, / Till the trees, and the beasts, and the clouds appear / From its chaos made calm by love, not fear.” CARDINAL NUMBERS.

To careen (verb, intransitive) is to tilt or lean to one side, or to toss from side to side, or to turn a ship on its side in dry dock.

It originates in the Latin ca- rina, a ship’s keel. To career (verb, intransitive) is to rush or move at high speed, perhaps wildly. In a description of a market scene in Niger, a book of true adventure contains an ex- ample of the strict use of career: A man trying out a camel careered out of control, much to the amusement of the crowd. The word is no longer used often. We are more likely to hear something like this on our television sets: Cable Car Thirteen careened almost out of control down one of the steep- est hills in San Francisco.

Apart from cars: an editorial warned of “careening” comets; TV news de- scribed roller-coaster fans who “careen the curves”; and in press items, bandits “careened” from a crime scene and a senator “careened around the world.” But The New York Times used the au- thentic word in a story about new legs for war veterans: Within seconds, the two men were skipping, lurching, careering forward. . . .

All of us have been caught in the rain and caught in traffic. Not long ago it became popular to en- cumber that simple verb with a superflu- ous adverb. A network anchorman and two local radio broadcasters provide the examples: “What happens when the tele- phone company gets caught up in its own web?” / “They got caught up in yes- terday’s strong earthquake.” / “In your case, you’ll be going early, so you won’t be caught up in the 8 : 30 dinner crush.” To catch up has long meant to come from behind through speed or effort: “The Braves were losing to the Twins by two runs but caught up in the ninth in- ning.” Another meaning of caught up, used only in the passive, adds the implication of gradualness or unwittingness to caught: “Many who came to listen to the speech were caught up in the mob hyste- ria.” / “She did not intend to abandon New York but was caught up in the glamour of Hollywood.” That adapta- tion of the phrase is useful. In the contexts of the broadcast sen- tences, however, “up” contributes noth- ing. All it tells us is that the speakers are caught in the web of a fad. See also UP. CAUSATIVE, CAUSE. See FAC- TOR, 1.

Celebrated suits a person or thing that has been publicly honored or praised. It comes, of course, from celebrate, one of whose meanings is to honor or praise someone or something publicly. Who would want to celebrate a murder case or a “child molesting case”? In describing a newly published set of cards, a writer for a suburban weekly mischose the first word in this sentence: Celebrated killers like cannibal Jeffrey Dahmer, Charles Manson, Vietnam War criminal Lt. William Calley (con- victed of killing 22 Vietnamese in the Mai Lai [ My Lai ] massacre) and Bon- nie and Clyde all appear amid the blood-splattered graphics. If the writer felt that he absolutely had to place an adjective before killers, he could have used infamous or notorious. But could any adjective enhance the ef- fect of a plain enumeration of those killers? CENSOR and CENSURE. The two verbs are pronounced somewhat differ- ently, SEN-sir and SEN-shur respec- tively. They have considerably different meanings, though they both originate in the same Latin root, censere, to judge, rate, or assess. To censor a written or dramatic work is for someone in authority to ex- amine it and remove passages that he considers objectionable before it is pub- lished or presented. Military censors have censored news stories at battle fronts, studying them and cutting out or blacking out whatever they do not want to be made public. Such activity is cen- sorship. Banning a work as a whole or refusing to sponsor something is not truly “censoring” or “censorship,” al- though such designations are often bandied about. To censure someone is to reprimand or express strong disapproval of him, particularly in an open or formal man- ner by a person or body in authority. For example, the U.S. Senate has censured several members for misbehavior. The words get mixed up. While ex- pressing distaste for a rap act that was being banned as obscene, a TV pan- elist asked, “Should it actually be cen- sured?” He probably meant censored, although that word would be question- able too. On another TV panel show, the mod- erator reported that a baseball club owner was “reprimanded and censored in the strongest terms” for racial slurs. Doubtless he meant censured. A supporter of a senator charged with sexual harassment said of his private conduct, “If it’s inappropriate behavior, then let them censor him.” Censure was the word she needed. Two nouns pronounced the same as censor are sensor, a device that reacts to a particular stimulus of energy (light, motion, etc.), and censer, a vessel in which incense is burned. CENSUS.

CHAIR and CHAIRMAN A chair is furniture; a human being is not furniture. The statement would be too obvious to make if not for published sentences like these: Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., the chair of the Judiciary Committee, has had a mixed record on abortion. . . . Eva has served as president and mem- bership chair. Currently she is the Chair of the Board of Directors of Magic Years Day Care. . . . Correction: the chairman of the judiciary committee, membership chairman, and chairman of the board of directors. Although widely used in some circles, chair as a substitute for chairman is proper only in the jargon of parliamen- tary procedure; e.g., “I appeal from the ruling of the chair.” In general prose, chair may signify a chairmanship or an academic office, but not an individual holding the office; for example, “The chair is vacant,” but not “He was ap- pointed chair.” Chair and chairman should be in lower case, except when the latter is af- fixed to a proper name (e.g., Chairman Mao ). In the second sample, Eva is both a small “chair” and a big “Chair.” A male chairman is formally ad- dressed as Mister Chairman, a female chairman as Madame Chairman. Avoid the ungainly barbarism seen in a headline: “Republicans select their chairpersons.” A newspaper editor nor- mally seeks brevity in headlines, so it is surprising that one would choose a seven-letter suffix, “-persons,” instead of a three-letter suffix with the same mean- ing, -men. The New York Times style manual properly instructs staff members to use chairman and chairmen for both men and women. “Do not use chairlady, chairwoman or chairperson. ” It explains that “chairman (like foreman, spokesman and some similar terms) suf- fices for both sexes.” The Associated Press, while approv- ing of “chairwoman,” rejects “chairper- son,” unless it is an organization’s formal title. But a story dispatched under its name contained a similar barbarism: “Glamour was supplied by the dinner’s chairpeople.” 2. CHAIR as verb As a verb (transitive) meaning to place in a chair or to install in a chair of office, chair is long established though little used nowadays. The modern press often uses chair as a verb meaning to serve as a chairman. A few authorities object to such use, at least in formal writing. The Times style manual says to avoid it. The examples are from two other newspapers. . . . Assemblyman Richard Rainey failed to win the chairmanship of the Public Safety Committee . . . but . . . he’s happy to settle for chairing the Local Government panel. . . . Assem- blyman Curt Pringle . . . will chair the Appropriations Committee. [Testimony was heard by] a House Government Operations subcommit- tee chaired by Rep. Mike Synar. . . . Utilizing an item of furniture as a verb is not out of the question. To table is to put (something) on a table; especially to put (a legislative measure) on the table, i.e., postpone indefinitely. To bed is to furnish (someone) with a bed, or to put (someone) to bed, or to go to bed. On the other hand, no one is likely to say, “A new governor will desk the state ad- ministration” or “A vast empire was throned by the queen.” 56 chair 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 56"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"CHARACTER. This noun has many legitimate meanings, among them in- tegrity; reputation; distinguishing quali- ties or features; a fictional person; and a symbol. Yet it is often used unnecessar- ily: “glue of a strong character,” instead of strong glue; or “the charming charac- ter of the painting,” instead of the charm of the painting. In phrases like “an event of this character,” kind or sort is more fitting. A colloquial sense of character is an eccentric person. The reporter who put it in the item below was not neces- sarily wrong but seemed to be short of facts. Clarence ———, otherwise known as Filmore Slim, a long-time San Fran- cisco character, pleaded guilty to one count of ——— in a plea bargain with the district attorney’s office yesterday. CHARITY. See MERCY and PITY. CHAUVINISM. Chauvinism (pro- nounced SHOW-vin-izm) is extreme pa- triotism, militant glorification of one’s country; or, by extension, excessive de- votion to any cause or group. It came from Chauvin, the name of a French sol- dier who was a fanatical admirer of Napoleon. Male chauvinist has been a common pair since the sixties. Some think that chauvinism or chauvinist has to do with opposition to or disparaging of a group, particularly women, and they omit the modifier. A topic on a TV quiz show was “chauvinist terms for women”: broad, dame, doll. They are slang terms, per- haps demeaning terms—far removed from chauvinism. CHECK OUT and CHECK-OUT. A software company advertises, in a magazine, “Checkout our Web Site. . . .” As a verb, check out consists of two words. In the context of the ad (transi- tive), it means examine or investigate. In another context (intransitive) it can mean to be proven authentic. “His story checks out.” To check out (verb, transitive) is also to account for a departure (especially of a guest from a hotel, a customer from a store, or a book from a library). Hotel guests check out (verb, intransitive); or they check out of, say, the Grand Hotel. Check-out (noun) is the process or act of departing from an establishment, or a time that a hotel sets for the end of a day. In addition it is a counter where cus- tomers pay in a self-service market, also called check-out (adjective) counter. The noun, as a single word, checkout, is instruction or training given to an air force pilot to familiarize him with a par- ticular aircraft. See also Punctuation, 4D, for an ex- ample of inconsistent use of check-out and check-in, the process or act of arriv- ing at an establishment. CHIEF JUSTICE. Misnaming the nation’s highest judicial office is a com- mon error, albeit a minor one. A front-page news summary said, “Died: Warren Burger, 87 , retired Supreme Court chief justice.” This was reported on a television net- work: “Warren Burger served as chief justice of the Supreme Court for seven- teen years. . . .” His successor, William H. Rehnquist, became “the sixteenth Chief Justice of the Supreme Court,” a book blurb said. The book itself, by Rehnquist, had it right. Federal law says: “The Supreme Court of the United States shall consist of a Chief Justice of the United States and eight associate justices. . . .” Each of the eight is a “Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.” The erroneous appellations often can pass. But surely some occasions, like the chief justice 57 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 57"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"ones referred to above, call for the offi- cial title to be dusted off.

It does concern an effect of an enforcement action, prose- cution, enactment, ruling, policy de- cision, crisis, or other occurrence, according to some critic or commentator. Seldom is heard a discouraging, imped- ing, inhibitory, or retardant word. More often the word is “chilling.” A few exam- ples follow; many more could be offered. [TV news of a crackdown on pornog- raphy in Alabama:] What worries civil libertarians is the chilling effect this might have on the people who make movies, even good movies. [An article on Christian Scientists: A medical ethicist] said that the prosecu- tions already are having a chilling ef- fect. [A TV “magazine”: Virginia’s re- moval of a physician’s medical license] had a chilling effect on doctors throughout the country. [An article about federal policy on scholarships:] . . . Mr. Wilder said Mr. Williams’s ruling would have “a chill- ing effect on all minority-targeted programs. . . .” CHINESE (language). Under “Chi- nese” (noun), at least three dictionaries offer “the language of China” as their second definition. In a strict sense, the language of China is a written language only and does not exist as a tongue. One speaks a Chinese language. An al- manac’s statement that “Chinese is the mother tongue of more than 1 billion people” is imprecise. So are a father’s words in a newspaper article about bilin- gual education: “I see people using lan- guage as a refuge, not mixing with other people who don’t speak Chinese.” China has various spoken languages of the Sino-Tibetan group, including Mandarin, Cantonese, Wu, Min, Hakka, and others. Sometimes they are called “dialects,” but they differ among them- selves as much as the Romance lan- guages of Europe do and people from one part of China often cannot compre- hend speech from another part. Man- darin is the official and most prevalent language of China. An uncommon error appeared in a picture caption related to the news story quoted above: “A blackboard in Chor Pang’s class at Key elementary shows in- structions in both English and Can- tonese characters.” Make it Chinese characters. One array of characters ex- ists for all of China, although there are a few variations in the way some charac- ters are assembled. The written language has no alphabet and no rules for pronunciation. Charac- ters and their meanings must be memo- rized. One must learn about 4 , 000 characters to read a Chinese newspaper. Scholars may know ten times as many. The characters are pronounced accord- ing to the words in one’s spoken lan- guage. CHORD and CORD. See Homo- phones. CHRISTEN. To christen (verb, tran- sitive) used to mean to make (someone) Christian. Now to christen an infant is to bring it into a Christian church by baptism; also to give it a name at bap- tism. By extension, to christen also means to name and dedicate (usually a vessel or structure) in a ceremony; or, loosely, just to name (anything).

(There was no ceremony, religious or otherwise.) CIRCUM- prefix. The prefix circum- comes from the Latin circum, around, and means around, surrounding, or on all sides. Sometimes different circum- words are confused. A high school freshman rose in his civics class to contrast the days of Mag- ellan, when it took three years to go around the world, with contemporary times, when “the world can be circum- cised in a few days.” Silent pause. The teacher said, “You mean circumnavi- gated, don’t you?” / “Yes.” Actually I had meant circumscribed. That would not have been the right word either. To circumnavigate the world, or an is- land, means to pilot a ship or airplane all around it. To circumscribe something is to encircle, restrict, or draw a line around it. To circumcise someone is to excise a certain genital part of him or her. The three verbs stem from circum plus the Latin verbs meaning to sail, to write, and to cut, respectively. A news agency said that many promises made to a Brazilian who paci- fied Indian tribes were “circumnavigated by the government. . . .” In that context, a better verb would have been circum- vented. To circumvent something, say a law, is to go around it figuratively, to keep it from happening, especially by craft or tricky maneuvering. The word originates in circum plus the Latin verb meaning to come. Three other well-known circum- words are the nouns circumference (a line or distance around a circle) and cir- cumstance (surrounding facts or condi- tions) and the adjective circumspect (prudent, cautious). They come from cir- cum plus the Latin verbs meaning to carry, to stand, and to look, respectively. The accent falls on the third syllable in circumnavigate, the second syllable in circumference, and the first syllable in the other five circum- words. CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE. It is a pervasive myth that circumstantial evidence is flimsy evidence. Often “mere” or “only” precedes “circumstan- tial.” A biographer wrote, concerning the evidence against two brothers charged with a fatal bombing: It would only be circumstantial evi- dence, and it was difficult to hang men on circumstantial evidence. On the contrary, circumstantial evidence can be just as strong as, or stronger than, the other type of evidence: direct evi- dence. And men have been executed on the basis of circumstantial evidence. Circumstantial evidence is informa- tion used in court to prove a contention indirectly. Rather than dealing with the main issue head on, it relies on reason- able inference from the surrounding cir- cumstances. Direct evidence deals with the main issue directly. A man is accused of burglarizing a home. No witness saw the crime being committed. The evidence against the de- fendant is solely circumstantial: The vic- tims’ valuables were found in his possession and his fingerprints were found at the crime scene. It is convincing evidence. A witness in a murder trial testifies that he saw Mr. Cain shoot Mr. Abel. Such evidence is direct. The defense then brings Mr. Abel into court, alive and well. That too is direct evidence. CLASS. See FACULTY; KIND OF, 1, 2; TYPE, 1. CLASSIC.

Now we seem to have instant “classics,” if advertisers can be believed. “The critics love Disney’s newest classic,” a TV announcer said. A book blurb hailed a man who had founded a record company “to churn out hundreds of classic records. . . .” What he recorded were not works by Mozart or Beethoven but rock ’n’ roll songs. And a review of a movie musical said, “The tunes . . . —including ‘Lola Wants’ and ‘Shoeless Jo From Hannibal Mo’—are classics.” A popular song that remains in the repertoire is a standard. Any writer who does not know the dif- ference between popular and classical music may do well to choose some other topic. Clause. A clause is a group of words with a subject (the doer of an action) and a predicate (the verb, the action). Some definers stop there. They would consider the simple sentence “Snow fell” a clause. Others would consider it a clause only in a sentence containing at least two clauses: “Snow fell and streets became slippery.” In the latter example, each clause (connected by and ) is an independent clause. Each could stand alone as a sepa- rate sentence. A dependent clause (also called a sub- ordinate clause) cannot stand alone. In “I love this ring, which my mother gave me,” the part up to the comma is an in- dependent clause and also the main clause of the sentence; the part starting with which is a dependent clause. CLAUSTROPHOBIA. See HO- MOPHOBIA. CLEAN and CLEANSE. See Con- fusing pairs. CLEMENCY. See MERCY and PITY. Cliché clash. By that term we mean a jarring mixture of clichés. Typically it turns up when an impromptu speaker gets confused between two expressions. For instance, when you do not want to confront a problem, do you sweep it under the rug or do you put it on the back burner? “After the campaign, it’ll be swept right back on the back burner,” said a senator on the drug problem. Each of eight samples here contains or hints at two well-known expressions. In the first seven, delivered on the air, the expressions are metaphors or combined parts of metaphors. A TV network reporter and panelist ridiculed reporters who had said that George Bush lost the Republican nomi- nation: “Where are those reporters to- day? They’re eating humble crow.” (Note to gourmets: Combine humble pie with crow—and voilà!) In a press conference, President Bush commented on the government of Panama. He could not seem to decide whether to use a clock or a board game as a metaphor, so he used them both: “You get the distinct feeling that the clock is not going to be set back to square one.” A man on the street was chosen for a sound bite in an election story on a TV network. Explaining why he was voting against an incumbent, he did not say “A leopard can’t change its spots” or “You can’t teach an old dog new tricks.” He said, “You can’t change spots on an old dog.” Do you prefer to play poker with wild cards or with a joker? Interviewed on the radio, a South African commentator said about white rightists in his government, “They are a wild joker in the package.” Another question is whether to give the economy a boost or a shot in the arm. A congressional leader theorized that a tax decrease was “giving the econ- omy a boost in the arm.” A panelist said on a television pro- gram of news commentary: 60 clause 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 60"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"We really have no evidence that Bill Clinton is going to step up to the plate in his first hundred days and really take the bull by the horns.

Her husband, Roger, freaks out but the party has momentum enough to keep going and just about everyone, it seems, has enough carnal knowledge of Ros to make her, posthumously, an even better conversation piece than she was in life. [Emphasis is added.] There is a place for hippie slang, just as there is for King James’s English—but they are not the same place. Clichés. The character of Big Brother was an exciting, new idea in George Or- well’s novel 1984. Used repeatedly as a metaphor in discussions and articles (for instance, as the subtitle of a column about new technology to snare violators of federal laws), the appellation loses most of its thrill, although it makes a point. All clichés were original and fresh ex- pressions at one time but now, by defini- tion, are trite, commonplace, and frequently imitated. That reality does not mean we should always avoid them. It depends on the cliché and the circum- stances. This volume contains many ex- amples of expressions considered overused, if not unworthy of use; al- though admittedly the merit of a particu- lar expression is subject to difference of opinion. A trite expression need not necessarily be banished, as long as ( 1 ) it is needed to convey the desired meaning, ( 2 ) it is cho- sen thoughtfully and makes sense, and ( 3 ) it is used correctly and, if a quota- tion, is quoted accurately. These are examples of oft misquoted sayings: “Power tends to corrupt and ab- solute power corrupts absolutely” (not “Power corrupts”)—Lord Acton. “For the love of money is the root of all evil” (not money itself)—Bible, 1 Timothy 6 : 10 . “Music hath charms to soothe a savage breast” (not “beast”)—Con- greve. “A foolish consistency is the hob- goblin of little minds” (not just consistency)—Emerson. “To gild refined gold, to paint the lily” (not “gild the lily”)—Shakespeare, King John. The expressions as a matter of fact, by the same token, in the final analysis, to all intents and purposes, and when all is said and done have meanings but are rather windy and probably not essential. Some other expressions are irrational, inaccurate, or almost meaningless. ( See “BLOW YOUR MIND”; “COULD CARE LESS”; “EXCEPTION PROVES THE RULE”; “IDEA WHOSE TIME HAS COME”; “OLDEST PROFES- SION”; “RINGING OFF THE HOOK”; “YES, VIRGINIA” ). On the other hand (that is a cliché), to tell hikers “It’s five miles as the crow flies but double that on the road” swiftly im- parts useful information; and “ the bur- den of proof is on the plaintiff” carries legal significance. All of the following fifty clichés also convey ideas succinctly, even though all those ideas might be ex- pressed differently: Break the ice, call the tune, clear the air, dark horse, fait accompli, give and take, happy ending, heaven on earth, in the same boat, labor of love, law and or- der, lethal weapon, lion’s share, make ends meet, make good, mean(s) well, miscarriage of justice, moral victory, more or less, mutual attraction, neck and neck, needle in a haystack, now and then, odds and ends, on the fence, open secret, patience of Job, pay the piper, per- sona non grata, place in the sun, pyrrhic victory, rags to riches, rank and file, sav- clichés 61 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 61"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"ing grace, see eye to eye, smell a rat, stab in the back, stitch in time, supply and de- mand, sweetness and light, sword of Damocles, take pot luck, tilt at wind- mills, tip of the iceberg, tit for tat, under a cloud, under the aegis of, vicious circle, wear and tear, wishful thinking. English is indebted to French for cliché in the sense of a printing stereo- type (an electrotype plate in traditional printing). A figurative cliché can be con- sidered a figuratively stereotyped expres- sion; i.e., one that is fixed, conventional, and unoriginal. The word is pronounced klee-SHAY. CLIMACTIC and CLIMATIC. See Confusing pairs. CLINCH. “Giants clinch,” a streamer cried. And there on the front page was a picture of baseball players hugging one another. To clinch something (transitive verb: it has an object) is to make it secure or settle it conclusively. The San Francisco team had clinched the championship of the National League’s western division. But just to clinch (intransitive verb: no object) means, in slang usage, to em- brace. In boxing, to clinch (intransitive) is to hold one’s opponent so as to avoid getting punched. A clinch (noun) is the act of clinching. Except for certain nautical and indus- trial senses, do not confuse clinch with clench, meaning (noun) a tight grasp or (verb, transitive) to grasp or bring to- gether tightly. Clinch and clench are used interchangeably when they denote (noun) a particular knot or a secure fas- tening device, especially a driven nail with its point beaten down, or (verb, transitive) to grip with one of those de- vices. COCA and COCOA. A press col- umn related a scheme to use caterpillars to eat the plants that yield cocaine. The heading said, in part, “The drug war- riors try ‘scientific’ fix: Bug cocoa fields.” Was an innocuous drink a target in the drug war? Cocoa powder, like chocolate, is made from the seeds of the cacao tree. It appears that an editor had confused cocoa with coca, the tree or shrub whose leaves are the source of cocaine. (The text had it right.) Another plant of similar spelling is the coco, also known as coco palm or co- conut palm or coconut tree. The plural of coco is cocos. COHORT. This sample sentence, from The New Republic, is entirely cor- rect in its usage: When Robert Bork’s Supreme Court nomination went down in flames, his candidacy vanquished by a well-funded cohort of liberal pressure groups, conservatives deplored the tactics used to defeat him. In the next sample, from a newspaper, a word that was treated properly in the magazine is put to questionable use. Looming above the throng at the huge CBS window is the elder states- man of the media, Walter Cronkite, hand over heart as a Metropoli- tan Opera baritone belts out the na- tional anthem, while his younger cohort, Dan Rather, stands respect- fully back. . . . In words like co-worker and coau- thor, the prefix co- indicates one who works jointly with another. So is it not reasonable to assume that a cohort is an associate of a “hort”? The trouble is that there is no such thing as a “hort.” Co- hort comes from the Latin cohors: enclo- sure, military company, or multitude. ( Court, courtesy, and curtain also stem from that Latin word.) The most specific meaning of cohort is 62 climactic and climatic 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 62"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"that of an ancient Roman military divi- sion, comprising 300 to 600 soldiers, a tenth of a legion. Cohort has been ap- plied also to any body of warriors. It can denote also any group or band joined in a struggle or common cause. That is the meaning of cohort in the opening sam- ple. The other samples illustrate the loos- est use, in which the word is applied to individuals. Often its tone is derogatory: What other operations beyond those already known were planned or executed by Mr. North and his co- horts in the enterprise? The youth . . . is accused of coerc- ing four children . . . into becoming his cohorts in the burglary and torch- ing of an apartment. . . . . . . Assistant U.S. Atty. John Gor- don . . . prosecuted Browning and 21 alleged cohorts. . . . The crime story represented by the last example shared an issue of a metropoli- tan newspaper with an obituary contain- ing this sentence: . . . Monroe and his cohorts gave movement to Bugs Bunny. . . . Such lax use of “cohort(s)” is not gen- erally acceptable, though it is usually condoned in casual speech. If a word like associate, colleague, companion, co- worker, or fellow-worker is meant, it should be used. For an implication of wrongdoing, one can choose accomplice, confederate, gangster, partner in crime, or ring member. (Occasionally confeder- ate is used in an innocent sense too.) COKE. See Trademarks. Collective nouns. 1. Group: singular or plural? 2. NUMBER OF, AVERAGE OF. 3. Quantities, measures. 1. Group: singular or plural? This question deals with the type of noun that is a collection of people, crea- tures, or things—a crowd, a team, a committee, a jury, a company, a herd, a flock, an array, or other group. When it is the subject of a sentence or clause, should we treat it as singular or as plu- ral? It may depend on whether we empha- size the group as a whole or its members. “The crowd was roaring,” but “A crowd of fans were fighting one another in the grandstand.” Any doubts are customarily settled in favor of the singular in the United States. Britons have leaned toward plural con- struction. A frequent mistake is to construe a subject as both singular and plural within a sentence or clause. The mis- taker is likely to choose a singular verb but a plural pronoun. In the following quotations, from metropolitan newspa- pers on two coasts, emphases are added to point up inconsistencies. Protests have been going on at the weapons station since June 10 when a group of demonstrators was arrested after they successfully caused a train to stop. “Was . . . they” protesting? No, they were protesting. “Was” is singular; “they” is plural. The two words do not mix. Most users of English have no trouble with simple sentences such as “The demonstrator was arrested” and “The demonstrators were arrested.” Noun and verb match in number: singular with singular, plural with plural. But compli- cate a sentence with an equivocal sub- ject, a clause or two, and a pronoun— then trouble arises. Is “a group of demonstrators” singu- lar or plural? Presumably the writer fixed on “group” and thought that it had collective nouns 63 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 63"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"to be singular: “was arrested.” So why did she not stick with her decision and write “after it . . . caused a train to stop”? Aware that the demonstrators were arrested as individuals, she must have felt a sense of plurality to switch tracks and write “they . . . caused.” But then the sentence called for “ were arrested.” (It never needed “success- fully.”) When a group is a formal body, the American custom is to construe it as sin- gular: “Congress has agreed. . . .” In Britain it is often construed as plural: “Parliament have agreed. . . .” This pas- sage, from an American newspaper, has it both ways: The first way around the wall proved to be in Hungary last August, when the reformist-minded Budapest government decided to take down its own barbed-wire fence with Austria and later dropped their objections to East Germans crossing from Austria into Hungary. “Its . . . fence” and “their objections” are inconsistent. “Their” ought to have been its. (A factual correction: the Germans were crossing from Hungary into Aus- tria.) When a group is informal, the writer or speaker often has a choice. Here, again, a press sentence is inconsistent: A team of California psychologists has developed a sense-of-humor test that they believe may eventually shed light on the fundamental nature of hu- man personality. If the team of psychologists is singular and “has” developed something, then it believes. But if “they believe,” the team of psychologists, being plural, have de- veloped something. Other options are repeating part of the subject (“a sense- of-humor test that the team be- lieves . . . ”) and rephrasing the subject and a verb (“ Five California psycholo- gists have developed . . .”). The final example in this section illus- trates two defects: A gang of robbers has been charged with holding up 31 banks . . . using the subway for their getaway. . . . If the gang is singular and “has been charged,” the pronoun representing “gang” also must be singular: Change “their” to its. However, if the gang, as plural, made “their getaway,” keep the plural pronoun but change “has” to have. Better yet, change “A gang of rob- bers has” to “ Five men have. ” They are not “robbers” until they are convicted. See also COUPLE; FACULTY; Nouns, 3; PAIR; STAFF. 2. NUMBER OF, AVERAGE OF The word number often throws writ- ers and speakers off course when it is part of the subject of a sentence. A growing number of researchers is trying to teach former crack addicts to stay away from . . . cues that will make them crave the drug. . . . “A growing number of researchers are trying. . . .” The number is not perform- ing the action; the researchers are. They are separate individuals. “A growing number of” merely qualifies “re- searchers.” If the number of researchers were ten, the writer would not have written “Ten researchers is trying. . . .” It should not make any difference that their number is growing. If the subject were, let us say, a group of researchers, a case might be made for “researchers is,” as grating as the phrase is. What is the reader or listener supposed to focus on? In the quoted sentence, the “researchers” obviously take the spot- light. Another sentence could start simi- larly but place its emphasis elsewhere: “The growing number of researchers in 64 collective nouns 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 64"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"America is attributed to an improvement in science education.” Here the emphasis is on the growing number. As a rule of thumb, a subject starting with “ a number of” takes a plural verb; a subject starting with “ the number of” takes a singular verb. Other phrases that can be misleading as part of a subject are an average of, a majority of, and a total of. Using them is more complicated than using a number of. It is grammatically correct to say “An average of 186 million eggs were pro- duced daily in the country last year.” The focus there is on eggs, a plural. It is equally correct to say “The average of 186 million was lower than . . .” or “The average . . . takes into account. . . .” Gen- erally “ the average” focuses on the aver- age as such. “An average of $ 5 . 50 is paid” and “An average of two pounds of sugar is needed” are correct too; the items would be singular without any mention of an average. See also MAJORITY, 2; TOTAL, 2. 3. Quantities, measures Measures of distance, money, weight, volume, and so on are commonly treated as singular, even though plural in form. They take singular verbs: “Twenty-two miles is a long walk.” / “About $ 3 . 7 mil- lion is owed.” / “Six feet, four inches was Abe’s height.” / “A hundred pounds more makes a ton.” / “Twelve gallons of gasoline fills my tank.” See also AMOUNT and NUMBER; FEWER and LESS; MANY and MUCH; Numbers; Verbs, 3. Colon. See Punctuation, 2. COME and CAME. The basic form of the verb come is the same as its past participle: “Come inside.” / “She has come a long way.” The past tense is came: “The rains came.” In a situation comedy, the star deliv- ered this line: “I don’t understand why I just couldn’t have came here and got my stuff on my own.” In a television inter- view, a military cadet said, “At any time they could have came to me.” And a caller to a radio talk show said, “He could’ve came to his co-workers and said, ‘How do you feel about this?’ ” In each instance, the past tense was mistak- enly used instead of the past participle; “have come ” would have been correct. The three would have had an excuse for the error if they had looked up come in a certain general dictionary. It erro- neously indicates that “came” is the past participle as well as the past tense. See also COME and GO. COME and GO. Considered sepa- rately, the two sentences in the quoted passage (from a front page of a renowned newspaper) are correct. But they are inconsistent—in more than their different lengths, which is a desirable in- consistency. Organizers of the second Take Our Daughters to Work Day estimated that about 3 million American girls, most of them between the ages of 9 and 15 , took off a day from school yesterday to go to work with their parents or other adults and get a closer look at opportunities awaiting them in the real world of work. And some boys came along this year. Why did girls “go” to work while boys “came” to work? Although the distinction between come and go blurs at times and each word has many meanings, you should know whether you’re coming or going. (That principle did not apply to Grou- cho Marx, who liked to sing, “Hello, I must be going.”) In a sentence like “Come to papa” or “Come to me, my melancholy baby,” the verb to come means to advance toward the one speaking. To come is also to ap- come and go 65 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 65"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"proach a particular place: “. . . Behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem. . . .” Another meaning is to appear, to move into view: “The fog comes on little cat feet.” Still another meaning is to follow: “Come with me.” It can mean also to be a native or resi- dent of a place (“She comes from Spain”), to happen or take place (“The time will come”), to reach a total (“That comes to exactly ten dollars”), and to ar- rive at a certain result or condition (“We came to an agreement and the meeting came to a halt”). The verb to go often means to depart, to move away from this place: “She has gone already.” / “Go and sin no more.” To go can mean also to travel to a place: “I must go down to the seas again.” / “We’re going home.” It can mean also to be in operation or to move: “The motor is going.” / “The car started to go.” Among other meanings are to disappear (“The dictatorship must go!”), to be in particular circumstances (“The people often go hungry”), to have a certain ten- dency (“This state usually goes Republi- can”), to be known (“He goes by Bubba”), to result (“How did the game go?”), to start (“Wait till I say ‘go’ ”), and to be compatible or sociable (“They go together”). Each of the two verbs figures in nu- merous expressions. A come idiom and a go idiom may have a word in common but differ completely in meaning. For in- stance, to come along can mean to ad- vance or proceed toward success: “She has really come along in her studies”; to go along can mean to cooperate: “When they offered him a lot of money, he went along with their plans.” Some other words similarly in common are about, by, down, into, off, on, and out. One sentence (and certainly a pair of sentences) can encompass both coming and going; this one does. Other exam- ples: “The cat comes and goes” (arrives and departs). “The sun comes and goes” (appears and disappears). But note that each subject has two contrary activities. In the passage about the girls who missed school to go to work with their parents and the boys who went along, two subjects did essentially the same thing. See also COME and CAME. COMFIT and COMFORT. See DISCOMFIT and DISCOMFORT. Comma. See Punctuation, 3. COMMISERATION. See MERCY and PITY. COMMIT, COMMITTED. 1. Missing objects. 2. Recommit. 1. Missing objects Something is missing from both of these sentences, extracted from a televi- sion newscast and a book about business mistakes: There isn’t the same pressure on Presi- dent Bush as there was on President Kennedy when he first committed to putting a man on the moon. If the U.S. firm had committed to a more direct form of involvement such as equity participation, it could have earned greater profits. President Kennedy “committed” what or whom? The country? The govern- ment? Himself? And what should “the U.S. firm” have “committed”? Itself? Its planning and resources? A quarter of its assets? In all its meanings—obligate, entrust, consign, refer, perpetrate, and so on— the verb commit is transitive. That is, it must transmit the action to an object. Each sample sentence lacks an object. Headlines need to be terse, yet they are not absolved from the requirements 66 comfit and comfort 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 66"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"of grammar. This one appeared on a front page of a metropolitan daily: “Syria Commits to Talks, Baker Says.” Use of the past participle, committed, would have avoided the misuse with- out being wordy: “Syria [is] Committed to. . . .” At one time, commit was used in an intransitive way (with no object) in the sense of perpetrating an offense. Such use is obsolete. No longer may one say, for instance, “This man has committed. ” One may say, “Many people who should know better commit grammatical of- fenses.” 2. Recommit To recommit is to commit again. This verb too is transitive only. It comes up mainly in the context of legislative ac- tion, in which it means to send a pro- posed measure back to a committee: “The Senate decided to recommit the bill.” The main article in an issue of a na- tional daily bore a headline that used the verb as though it were intransitive: “PLO Recommits to Peace, but Reins in Arafat.” The headline could be chal- lenged on both grammatical and factual grounds. (The story said the Palestine Liberation Organization, critical of its leader’s failure to gain wider Palestinian self-rule, “set specific conditions for the continuation of talks with Israel.”) A re- placement: “PLO Sets Terms for Peace Talks, Reins in Arafat.” Common nouns. See Nouns, 1. COMMON SENSE. Common sense may be defined either as ordinary sound judgment or as the assumptions people are liable to make without special knowledge. “For millennia a flat earth was common sense.” Originally com- mon sense was supposed to be a master sense that gathered and interpreted the five senses. In practice, the term fre- quently stands for whatever point of view the user expresses. When Congress favored declaring Communist China a most favored na- tion, a spokesman for capitalist groups said, “We see it as a vote for common sense.” A talk show host said, “You [women] can’t have it all. It’s just common sense.” A (male) colleague of his said later, fa- voring higher prices for women’s hair- cuts than for men’s, “Let’s try to use some common sense on this”; and favor- ing compulsory auto insurance, “It’s just common sense.” A competitor prefaced a discussion of Cuba by saying, “I’m go- ing to give you the kind of common- sense logic that you don’t get in most of the media these days.” In a headline, a weekly presented a point of view as “Commonsense Drug Policy. . . .” Used as an adjective in that way, the term should be hyphenated: common-sense. COMMUNIST, COMMUNISM. See SOCIALIST, SOCIALISM. COMMUTE. To commute (as an in- transitive verb) means to travel between home in one community and work in an- other. Another common meaning of the verb (transitive) is to change a penalty or debt to a lesser one. For instance, when a governor changes a convict’s sentence from life imprisonment to ten years, he commutes it. It is the penalty that is commuted, not the person on whom it was imposed. This is wrong: Mao’s widow was sentenced to death, later commuted to life imprisonment, for heading the so-called Gang of Four, blamed for the worst excesses of the 1966 – 1976 Cultural Revolution. Not the woman but her sentence was commuted. commute 67 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 67"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Comparative and superlative de- grees. Many an adjective or adverb has three forms, or degrees (that is, degrees of comparison ): the positive, compara- tive, and superlative. 1 . A word in the positive degree de- scribes something—say, as soft, high, fast, sweet, or good— without com- paring it with something else. 2 . The comparative degree indicates that something exceeds something else. It is softer, higher, faster, sweeter, or bet- ter. 3 . The superlative degree is the most ex- treme: softest, highest, fastest, sweet- est, or best. Something is in the top order or surpasses all others in some respect. Use the superlative only when what you describe is among three or more of its kind. If it is one of only two, use the comparative. “This melon is the largest of the three” but “This melon is the larger of the two.” It is a common mistake to use the su- perlative instead of the comparative; for instance, to say that someone is the “tallest” of two. See BETTER and BEST (etc.). A talk show host made the oppo- site mistake: “The three networks were fighting to see who would get the bigger piece of the pie.” One network would get the biggest piece. (And “who” should be which. See WHO, THAT, and WHICH, 1. ) A book about business mistakes makes a verbal mistake: The firm encountered legal problems in West Germany, however, because German law dictates that superlatives are not permitted. One product can- not be called better (or stronger) than another. Better or stronger are not “superlatives.” They are comparatives.

Two other problems. 1. Similarities and contrasts Each of these four sentences contains one wrong word: . . . Detective Tom Lange . . . asked him to bring the glove found outside Simpson’s mansion into the middle of the crime scene so it could be com- pared to the glove found near the bod- ies. Typically, community college part- timers earn about half the hourly pay of full-time teachers—$ 28 . 38 com- pared to $ 53 . 36 . . . .

Each “to” should be with. When we compare something to something else, we are likening the two things or pointing out similarities. (“The streaks on Mars used to be compared to our canals.” / “People have compared Castro to Stalin.”) When we compare something with something else, we are either contrasting the two (“$ 28 . 38 compared with $ 53 . 36” ) or examining them to look for differences or similarities (“studies that compared the drug with placebo or fake pills”).

The “to” seems to imply that the detective wanted to make the two gloves look like a pair—probably not what ei- ther he or the writer had in mind. With would have suggested that the detective wanted an objective comparison of the two gloves. 2. Two other problems The sentence below (from an edito- rial) illustrates two other points. Four in 10 black men over the age of 20 smoke, compared to only 32 per- cent of white men. The grammarian Wilson Follett would have challenged compared, as well as to, in the last sentence, had he lived to read it: The black men would smoke even if not compared with the white men; the two facts are independent and belong in separate independent clauses or sen- tences. He railed at length against “gra- tuitous comparison,” the statement of independent facts as if they were depen- dent. Note also that one of those two statis- tics was presented on a scale of one to ten and the other on a percentage scale. While some readers may have had no trouble converting “four in 10 ” to forty percent, or “ 32 percent” to about three in 10, the writer’s zeal for synonymizing may have obscured the message for other readers. Comparison. 1. “More” or “less” than what? 2. What are we comparing? 1. “More” or “less” than what? In the mythical realm of advertising, the advertiser’s product customarily is “better,” gives you “more,” and costs you “less.” What it is better, bigger, and cheaper than is left to the imagination. The veracity or mendacity of such vague claims cannot easily be checked. A copy- writer is interested in sales, not facts. Informative writing has to make more sense. When something is said to be big- ger, smaller, quicker, more beautiful, less crowded, or the like, one needs to know what the thing is bigger than, smaller than, and so on. The word than does not always have to be in the sentence. (“John weighs 300 pounds. His wife is even heavier.”) And the comparison is implied in certain expressions, such as higher ed- ucation and the upper classes. In general, though, when more or less or an -er word in the comparative degree is used, it must be made completely clear what is being compared to what. This sentence fails to make it clear: While residents in the San Francisco metropolitan area—including San Mateo and Marin counties—spent less on food last year, they still rank ninth in total restaurant sales and tops in per capita spending. They “spent less on food” than what? Than on clothing? Than anyone else? Even if the reporter had written, for in- stance, “spent less on food last year than they spent in the previous year, ” the sen- tence still would have raised questions and contained inconsistencies. (How could the spending of “residents” be dis- tinguished from that of visitors? If the spending was for “food,” why are only restaurants mentioned, not food stores? Was “per capita spending” just in restau- rants too? On what scale were the resi- dents measured? They were “ninth” or “tops” out of how many units, of what nature, in what geographical category?) See Comparative and superlative de- grees and its references for some gram- matical problems. 2. What are we comparing? To be compared, things must be com- parable. They have to fit the same gen- eral category. You do not compare apples with orangutans. Apples and or- anges at least are both fruits. comparison 69 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 69"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"The discussion here deals with logic and style, not the verity of the premise expressed in the newspaper sentence be- low. . . .

He seems to be comparing a time in the past with three governors. What he probably meant to say and should have said was of this order: “In contrast to the governors of their states 40 years ago, the Governors today . . .” or “ Unlike their counterparts 40 years ago, the Governors today. . . .” A columnist, writing about quartet singing, got into double trouble: Barbershop was big in the ’ 50 s, as big at any time since its Golden Era in the early years of the century. To insert a second as— “as big as ”— would help but not completely rescue the sentence. It seems to be comparing size with time. A complete correction: “. . . as big as it was at any time . . .” Although the examples above are not worded logically, at least we know the essential points of similarity or contrast that the writers have tried to express. In the example below, the essential message is not clear: Contrary to popular belief, children account for 15 % of the homeless pop- ulation. What is the “popular belief”? Contrary to popular belief usually implies that the adjoining statement is the opposite of the belief. The statement here, a statistic, has no clear opposite.

A book is subtitled “A Com- pendium of Source Material to Make Your Speech Sparkle.” An article refers to “ ‘Outrageous Animation,’ a feature- length compendium of cartoons. . . .” In both cases “compendium” is used as though it meant collection. A compendium is a summary, abridg- ment, or outline of a work. That is one meaning of the word in Latin, its source. Perhaps the comp-, as in compilation or comprehensive, fools people. Compendium (noun) is related to compendious (adjective), meaning sum- marized, containing all the essentials succinctly. Noah Webster’s first general dictionary, 1806 , was titled A Compen- dious Dictionary of the English Lan- guage. He meant that it was concise. When a lexicographer sought “to pro- duce a work that would be as compen- dious as Webster’s Third, ” did he want it to be as concise? Other comments of his (references, in an essay, to “The sheer 70 compassion 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 70"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"quantity and range of the material” and “the inclusiveness of this huge new dic- tionary”) indicate that he meant as inclu- sive or as comprehensive. COMPLAINANT. The chairman of a Senate committee asked a witness at a prominent hearing three times whether the “conduct of a complaintant” could be relevant to a rape case. A person who complains, particularly in the sense of filing a formal complaint in a legal case, is a complainant, spelled with just one t. One who complains, but not in a formal sense, can also be called a complainer, with no t. There is no “com- plaintant.” Complement. As a term of grammar, complement is used in varying ways. In the broadest sense, it is a word or group of words that completes a grammatical construction. Usually the word or group of words goes with a verb in the predi- cate of a sentence ( see Verbs, 1D ) and makes the meaning of the verb or its ob- ject complete. A complement may be a direct object (“Jack built the house ” / “I met him ”) or an indirect object (“Give the boy his money” / “I will send her a letter”). See Verbs, 1E. More often complement refers to a subjective complement or an objective complement. A subjective complement (or subject complement ) accompanies a linking verb and identifies or qualifies the subject. If the complement is a noun, it is called a predicate noun (or predicate nomina- tive ). (“That bird is a gooney. ”) If it is an adjective, it is called a predicate adjec- tive. (“They seem happy. ”) See Verbs, 1F. An objective complement (or object complement ) completes the meaning of a direct object. (“His friends call him Red. ” / “Mining made them rich. ” / “John got the clock to run. ”) See also FACT- words, 2 ( factitive ). COMPLEMENT and COMPLI- MENT. An advertisement for an apartment complex included this sen- tence: “Beautiful shade trees compliment these garden apartments and beautifully landscaped grounds.” If trees could talk, they might “compliment” the apart- ments and grounds on their appearance. As it is, the writer should have used the other word, complement. To compliment (verb, transitive) someone is to pay the person a compli- ment (noun): an expression of admira- tion, congratulation, or praise. (Think of beautiful i ’s.) To complement (verb, transitive) something is to add, or serve as, a com- plement (noun) to it. A complement is that which makes something whole or brings it to perfection or completion. (Complete this word with e ’s.) A savings bank displayed a sign say- ing, “ASK ABOUT OUR COMPLE- MENTARY MORTGAGE ANALYSIS.” If the intended meaning was that the mortgage analysis would be provided free of charge as a courtesy or compli- ment, complimentary should have been the adjective chosen. Complementary means acting as a complement, complet- ing what is lacking. COMPOSE. See COMPRISE, 1. COMPOUNDS (chemicals). See SILICON and SILICONE. Compounds (words). See Plurals and singulars, 2B; Punctuation, 4D. COMPRISE. 1. “COMPRISED OF.” 2. “INCLUDE, CONTAIN.” 3. The whole and the parts. 1. “COMPRISED OF” To comprise (verb, transitive) is to consist of, to be composed of —of is part of the meaning. In four press samples, the word’s past comprise 71 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 71"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"participle, comprised, is misused as though it meant “composed.” (In the first two, it opens an appositive phrase. In the latter two, it serves as a main verb.) The special panel, comprised of seven senators on the Judiciary Committee and two from Foreign Relations, also meets privately. The author will develop the plot in consultation with the committee, comprised of Mr. Clarke and two other lawyers. “Comprised of” is wrong. Changing it to comprising would correct both sen- tences: “comprising seven senator s...” / “comprising Mr. Clarke and. . . .” An- other way is to change “comprised” to consisting, composed, or made up, keep- ing of. The court is comprised of eight ac- tive judges. ...Our r esearch team was com- prised of women. To fix those two sentences, change “is comprised of” to comprises (“The court comprises eight active judges”) and re- duce “was comprised of” to comprised (“Our research team comprised women”). There are other ways: “The court consists of” and “Our research team consisted of” / “The court is com- posed of” or “ made up of” and “Our re- search team was composed of” or “ made up of.” (We assume that the com- position of each group was given in its entirety.) 2. “INCLUDE, CONTAIN” At least three dictionaries mislead- ingly give as one of their definitions of comprise “To include, contain.” The meanings are not the same. Using comprise implies that all the items making up the court or team or other body are being enumerated. (“A water molecule comprises two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.”) But using include implies that not all the items are being enumerated. (“A water molecule includes one atom of oxygen.”) Contain can have either meaning, de- pending on the context. (“This can con- tains only tomatoes. That one contains salt and spices.”) 3. The whole and the parts The whole comprises its parts, not the other way around. Congress comprises two houses. Two houses do not “com- prise” Congress. This passage appears in a medical dic- tionary, under “fat”: Three fatty acids, oleic acid . . . stearic acid . . . and palmitic acid . . . com- prise the bulk of fatty acids present in neutral fats found in body tissues. A correction that keeps the word com- prise is as follows: “The bulk of fatty acids present in neutral fats found in body tissues comprise three fatty acids: oleic acid” etc. An alternative correction is to change “comprise” to make up: “Three fatty acids . . . make up the bulk,” etc. Concrete noun.

If anyone really concludes from such reports that accidents bring about physi- cal fitness, blame a combination of two journalistic locutions: ( 1 ) reversal of the chronological order of events, often with after, in an effort to update the news; and ( 2 ) use of condition in a special sense, that of a medical prognosis, a prediction of a patient’s chance of recov- ery. A patient who is sore, bruised, and hurting may not feel in “good”—let alone “excellent”—condition, but that is what the reporter got from his medical source. Sometimes the word condition or a synonym is omitted from a headline dealing with someone’s health, and read- ers may be told that the person “is criti- cal” or “serious” or “good.” The result may be an ambiguity or, at least, a temp- tation to wags. See also AFTER; CRITICAL. 2. Contradictory meanings Condition (noun and verb) has dozens of meanings. Two of its popular mean- ings are contradictory: To be in or get into condition refers to physical fitness or good health, but to have or suffer a condition refers to an ailment or disease. Neither application is suitable in writ- ings on scientific or medical topics. In “He suffers from a heart condition,” the last word would bother many editors, even in the popular press. Its use is your choice. Conditional sentences. See Subjunc- tive; WAS and WERE. CONDOLENCE. See MERCY and PITY. CONFESS. The primary meaning of confess is to acknowledge or admit one’s crime, misdeed, or fault. The implication is that what is confessed is bad or faulty, or so perceived. The only perceptible fault in the fol- lowing sentence, the lead of an article, is its final word: “Four times they asked me to play Kate, and four times I refused,” Car- ole Shelley confessed. What is so bad about turning down a part in a play that an actress has to “con- fess” it? In colloquial speech, confess and ad- mit often are used interchangeably. When a formal, written confession of a crime is made, confess is more precise. In the sense of acknowledging wrong- doing, confess is both a transitive verb (“He confessed the burglary”) and an in- transitive verb (“He confessed”). In that sense, admit is transitive only. With the sanction of several dictionaries, one may either confess a crime or confess to a crime. Some grammarians consider “confess to” clumsy and not idiomatic. In religion, confess can mean to de- clare one’s faith or belief, or to make one’s sins known to a priest; the priest is said to confess someone. See also ADMIT. CONFIDENT. See SURE. Confusing pairs.

CONNIVE. This verb stems from the Latin connivere: to close the eyes. The strict meaning of connive is to pretend not to see a wrong or evil, thereby tacitly consenting to it. It goes with at. For in- stance, “The president connived at the crimes of his men.” The word (in the form of a gerund) was not used strictly when a broadcaster said the movie Wall Street conveyed the message that “lying, cheating, and con- niving are bad things.” Nor was its use (as a verbal adjective) strict in an article about a lottery winner, whose “conniv- ing relatives . . . tore his work clothes to shreds to keep him at home. . . .” “Connive” is often used loosely in place of contrive or conspire, “conniv- ing” in place of contriving, conspiring, or cunning. Popular confusion probably arose from the words’ superficial similar- ity. Their roots (Old English for cunning, Latin for the others) differ completely. CONSECRATE, CONSECRA- TION.

A question for two critics and a reporter follows these ex- cerpts: Here is a man [Scorsese] who, by gen- eral consensus is the best American di- rector of the last twenty years. When the Chicago group played New York last fall, the general consen- sus . . . was that the dancers did a swell job. But there has always been a general consensus of some kind of Mafia in- volvement in the crime. . . . What other kind of consensus is there? It is general by definition: general agree- ment. Sometimes consensus is defined as unanimity, although it can describe also a collective view or majority agreement. The phrase “consensus of opinion” is common. Various authorities frown on it, considering “of opinion” redundant. Some others justify a consensus of opin- ion, particularly when it needs to be dis- tinguished from a consensus of authority, of evidence, of faith, of taste, of testimony, and so on. In any case, “consensus of” does not go with “some kind of Mafia involve- ment” (in the third example). You can test the sentence by substituting agree- ment for “consensus.” Among possible corrections: change the first “of” to that there was or change “consensus of” to belief in. Consensus sometimes is misspelled “concensus” and occasionally is confused with “census.” Consensus, like consent, originates in the Latin consentire, to agree. It has nothing to do with census, an official counting of inhabitants, which comes unchanged from Latin. CONSENT. See CONSENSUS. CONSUL, COUNCIL, and COUNSEL. See Homophones. CONTAIN. See COMPRISE, 2. CONTINUAL(LY) and CONTIN- UOUS(LY). Continuous (adjective) or continuously (adverb) means without in- terruption; going on steadily, either in time or in space. “The dam provides us with energy continuously.” / “I use a continuous roll of paper in my printer.” For centuries continuous was the meaning of continual, and dictionaries still include the former as one of the defi- nitions of the latter. In modern times, though, a useful distinction between the two arose. Continual (adjective) or con- tinually (adverb) now means frequently repeated, taking place again and again. “Old Faithful’s continual spraying of water and steam into the air fascinates visitors to Yellowstone.” / “Our neigh- bors are continually playing music loudly.” To substitute “continuous” or “continuously” would change each meaning. Sometimes the words are mistakenly or carelessly interchanged, as in this pair of examples: In the Arctic in December “it is dark continually.” / “A continuous use of ‘miracle’ to describe any coinci- dence or amazing happening is vulgar.” Make it continuously in the first sentence (the darkness persists without interrup- tion), continual in the second sentence (the use is repeated, not steady). “Our goal at any given time is to strive continually to be ‘the best,’ ” the director of an institute wrote. She proba- bly meant continuously strive, rather than strive only at intervals. ( See also Quotation problems, 3. ) Contractions. 1. Errors in number. 2. Informality. 3. Quotation. 4. Perplexity. 1. Errors in number A contraction is a shortened version of a word or phrase, such as can’t in place of cannot or it’s in place of it is. Its use does not relax any grammatical requirement. Subject and verb must still 78 consensus 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 78"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"agree in number, just as if no contraction were used. Both samples below contain errors in number. There’s even gossip, advice columns and TV listings [in a Polish weekly]. “There’s” is meant to contract there and is. But is does not go with the enumer- ated features. Change “there’s” to There are. Scientists say it’s “usually impossi- ble” to predict when an earthquake occurs but there’s been “tremendous advances” in predicting where one oc- curs, said Gore. This time “there’s” purports to contract there and has. But has (singular) dis- agrees with “advances” (plural). Change “there’s” to there have. See also DON’T and DOESN’T. 2. Informality Usually contractions are acceptable in spoken English. They may also fit writing that is informal or that aims at simulating speech. They are standard in some ex- pressions, “ It’s a boy.” / “It can’t happen here.” / “ Aren’t we all?” / “ Isn’t it time?” An -n’t in a question is especially com- mon and often desirable, e.g., “ Won’t you come home?” (rather than “Will you not come home?”). But eloquence may call for the complete not: “If you prick us, do we not bleed?” (rather than “don’t we bleed?”). Except where speakers are quoted us- ing them, contractions can stand out conspicuously in formal writing or ac- counts of grave events, weakening the writing and giving it an inappropriate in- formality. Two examples from the press follow. He’s accused of trying to blow up his disabled parents and grandmother by rigging a natural-gas leak in the base- ment of their Russell Street home. Witnesses reported tank movements Monday, but the reports couldn’t be officially confirmed. Why “He’s” and “couldn’t” instead of he is and could not? Did the reporters think a chatty style fit those stories? The latter sentence would be particularly un- suitable for oral delivery, in which “-n’t” is not always articulated. 3. Quotation Contractions may or may not be war- ranted in quotations. If a speaker did not utter any contraction, its use can border on misquotation. The excerpt below is from a published account of a rally in Moscow. “The agenda’s already been de- cided,” said Boris N. Yeltsin, the pop- ular maverick deputy-elect. “ It’s been prepared by the apparat. . . . If we al- low ourselves to be dictated to by the apparat, we will sink into a morass that we’ve only now begun to climb from,” he said. [Emphases are added.] Yeltsin spoke in Russian, a language with few contractions. It has nothing like “agenda’s” / “It’s” / “we’ve.” What do they contribute to the report that agenda has, It has, and we have would not? Far from putting fanciful contractions in their quotations, some writers go to the opposite pole and eliminate contrac- tions that were uttered. President Nixon was widely quoted as saying, “I am not a crook.” His precise words were, “Well, I’m not a crook [emphasizing “not”]. I’ve earned everything I’ve got.” Note the three contractions. 4. Perplexity Contractions can be confused with possessive forms. Even professional writ- ers sometimes mix them up. See ITS and IT’S; Punctuation, 1; WHOSE, 2 (confu- sion with who’s ). During the national Democratic con- contractions 79 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 79"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"vention in San Francisco, a newspaper there ran a banner with this phrase: “Mondale’s halfway home.” Was the paper running an exposé of a term spent by the vice-president in a house for reha- bilitation? The headline raised that ques- tion in my mind. But no; the story underneath said he had acquired half the delegates needed to win the presiden- tial nomination. The apostrophe -s meant is. If contractions can confound those of us who are native to English, pity the newcomers and foreign visitors trying to decipher them. The contractions in these three passages are emphasized: What’s puzzling is that Mrs. Cheney, who’s performed ably in her job, applauds the Public Library’s “considerable success in recent years in achieving increased support. . . .” But if the people who make up America’s work force are more di- verse than ever before, it’s men who are still in charge—and who’ll stay that way if they heed Felice S——. . . . . . . W—— is one of about 20 young- sters with cancer—or who’ve had can- cer—camped at Monte Toyon. . . . Readers of English must know the possessive -’s. They may also know that -’s can stand for is when attached to a noun or, sometimes, a pronoun. Those who are unfamiliar with American con- versational speech may not realize that -’s can also stand for has or us (“Let’s eat”). And they may not know what to make of some creations—like “who’ll” and “who’ve,” in which half of will and half of have are expunged for no obvious reason. CONTRARY TO POPULAR BE- LIEF.

Convince deals with con cepts. It is to cause (someone) to believe something. Persuade deals with per formance. It is to cause (someone) to do something. If “We convinced the governor of Smith’s innocence” or “We convinced him that Smith was innocent,” only the governor’s belief changed; the man was not yet freed. If, however, “We per- suaded him to pardon Smith” or “He was persuaded to pardon Smith,” ah, then there was action. Note that convince (verb, transitive) may be followed by of or that, never by “to.” Persuade (verb, transitive) is com- monly followed by to. Literature of the past shows also persuade into or unto plus noun. In practice, the two words are often interchanged. In a typical mixup, an an- chor man said on network television: He has convinced the Food and Drug Administration to change the food- additive laws. He, a doctor, has persuaded the FDA to change the rules. One could also say the doctor has convinced the FDA that it should change the rules. However, the persuaded phrasing is terser and makes it clear that rules—not just minds—have been changed. COOK. See BOIL. COOL.

The issue is not whether one can cope with something but whether one can just cope— with nothing in par- ticular. An example is excerpted from a journal of business and finance: Faced by the pent-up demand created by neglect during Ethiopian rule, barefoot doctors from the front lines couldn’t cope. “Cope” with what? With anything? With everything? With all the medical problems of the civilian population of Eritrea? Cope (verb, intransitive) came to En- glish from the Old French couper, to strike, which came from coup, a blow. Usually cope is followed by with, in a phrase meaning to struggle with or con- tend with, (something) either with some success or on fairly even terms. Cope without with, meaning to deal with or manage some situation or other, is a relative innovation, described as “colloq.” by the Oxford English Dictio- nary. It did well in the title of a musical show, Don’t Bother Me, I Can’t Cope, but its use in more formal contexts meets with objections from various writers, speakers, and editors. Three-fourths of the American Heritage Dictionary ’s us- age panel found it unacceptable. Omitting the with phrasing shrinks the word’s informative value. Unless the context makes it clear, such use of cope generates questions. Copula or copulative verb (linking verb). See BAD and BADLY; FEEL; GOOD and WELL; Pronouns, 10D; Verbs, 1F.

COUPLE. 1. Inconsistency in number. 2. Plural construction. 3. Use as modi- fier. 1. Inconsistency in number The journalists who wrote the four sentences below seem unable to make up their minds. The couple . . . was the crown prince and princess of Sweden . . . on their honeymoon. . . . The couple has agreed to annul their stormy marriage. . . . . . . The couple wants to demolish a unique contemporary home on their property. Couple enjoys reclusive life on their mountain. What the writers cannot decide is whether to regard husband and wife as one or two. In each sentence, couple is regarded as both singular and plural. The verb, such as “was” or “wants,” is singular while the pronoun, “their,” is plural. Any logic behind such inconsis- tency fails to emerge. An old editors’ tale holds that couple must be singular. If you wish to follow that path, at least do so all the way through a sentence. Accordingly, “their” becomes its in each of the four samples. When you construe couple as singular, be prepared to say, “The couple was on its honeymoon.” Does the phrasing look or sound odd? Then try a plural con- struction. 2. Plural construction In general, the noun couple denotes two of the same kind, whether closely re- lated or not. It may be treated as singular or plural, depending on the kind. When it refers to a man and woman who are united in some way, couple is more likely to be plural. Most of the time you can- not go wrong with sentences like the fol- lowing; they are corrections of the four samples: The couple . . . were . . . on their honeymoon. . . . The couple have agreed to an- nul their stormy marriage. . . . . . . The couple want to demolish a . . . home on their property. Couple enjoy reclusive life on their mountain. If the man and woman are named, of- ten they can replace “the couple.” 3. Use as a modifier As a modifier, couple is usually pre- ceded by a and followed by of: “a couple of kids.” An article said “there are a cou- ple ways” to reduce the state’s liabilities. Make it “a couple of ways.” When a couple precedes certain adjec- tives, including more and less, no of fol- lows: “a couple more oranges.” A couple means two of something.

COVET. To covet is to crave or long for something. It may imply craving something that belongs to another. The Ten Commandments say that one shall not covet a neighbor’s wife and goods. Covet is a verb (transitive and intransi- tive), pronounced KUV-it. The news media frequently use cov- eted, the past participle, along with award or prize in the manner of these ex- cerpts: “Solectron . . . won the coveted Malcolm Baldridge National Quality Award in 1991 .” / “Now we hear that Dilbert and his hapless colleagues are up for a coveted Reuben Award. . . .” The award is often one that most people have never heard of. Who is do- ing all that coveting? Creatures, plural. See Plurals and sin- gulars, 2C. CREDIBLE and CREDITABLE. See Confusing pairs. CREDIT. A three-column headline over a letter to the editor of a large daily said, “Credit Reagan for Destroying So- cial Programs.” From the standpoint of grammar and not politics, the verb should be blame, not “credit.” If the let- ter writer had opposed social programs (which was not so), credit might have been appropriate. (Then it would have been more idiomatic to “Credit Reagan With the Destruction of Social Pro- grams.”) In both financial and nonfinancial senses, credit (noun) is positive, not neg- ative. To credit a financial account is to add to one’s credit: the amount in one’s favor. To credit a person with something is to give him credit, in the nonfinancial sense: worthy approval, commendation, honor, or praise. Another large daily made a wildly in- appropriate use of credit as a noun in a main headline: “Bomb Rips Apart Israeli Bus, Kills 22 ; ——— Takes Credit.” One takes credit for, say, founding an institu- tion or creating an invention, not for committing a massacre. Accepts Respon- sibility would have been right. (The headline named the group, thereby granting it the notoriety it craved. Just “Group” would have been preferable.) See also BLAME, 2. CREDITOR and DEBTOR. A na- tional television show devoted to the try- ing of monetary claims should be able to distinguish a creditor from a debtor. Yet its announcer said about a woman who was sued for money, “She is accused of dodging a debtor.” If she owed the debt, she was the debtor. The one seeking pay- ment was the creditor. A weekly paper said that someday Iraq’s “bank accounts will be unfrozen and it will have to pay its debtors.” Creditors. CRESCENDO. No one with a knowledge of music is likely to have written any of these passages: Clark’s mounting annoyance with the witness reached a crescendo in redirect questioning. But with cocaine, dopamine is not ab- sorbed and continues to excite nerve cells. The result is that the nerve stim- ulation rises to a crescendo with no relief, causing the feeling of euphoria. When troubled at home, seek so- lace—and photo opportunities— abroad. President Nixon offered a prototypical example with his jaunt to Egypt in 1974 , as Watergate reached a crescendo. Crescendo does not mean a high point. It is a musical term that means (as an adjective or adverb) gradually getting louder or (as a noun) a gradual swelling crescendo 83 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 83"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"of volume or a passage that gradually gets louder. Crescendo tells us nothing about the sound level, only about the process of increasing it. In musical scores, crescendo usually is expressed by a symbol ( < ) or an abbreviation ( cresc., cres., or cr. ). To say that a piece of music “reached” or “rises to” a crescendo would be meaningless. A crescendo may, however, reach a forte, a loud passage; a fortissimo, a very loud passage; or even a piano, a soft passage, if the music is very soft at the start. The opposite of crescendo is diminuendo or decrescendo, meaning gradually getting quieter. Crescendo in Italian means increasing. All of the italicized words were adopted, full blown, from Italian. Crescendo may be used figuratively, in a nonmusical sense, to mean an increas- ing or intensifying, not a peak of inten- sity: “the market’s crescendo of activity as the morning progressed.” Two television networks made the same kind of mistake on the same evening in reporting the same speech. Describing the increasing support for Bill Clinton for president, one newscaster said: It reached a kind of crescendo with Mario Cuomo’s speech. The anchor man on the other network said about that speech: Particularly did Cuomo do a good job of building to a crescendo. The sentence below does have a dy- namic crescendo, but one word needs to be omitted. The Reagan administration, amid a rising crescendo of questioning about the U.S. role in policing the sea lanes of the war-torn gulf, strove to adopt a business-as-usual posture. . . . “Rising” is redundant. Rising is what makes a crescendo. CRIME, MISDEMEANOR, and FELONY. The title of the Woody Allen movie Crimes and Misdemeanors reflected the popular notion that a “mis- demeanor” is not a “crime.” The misde- meanor is one of the two main categories of crime, the less serious category. The more serious one is the felony— the kind we worry about. A misdemeanor is usually punishable by a fine or a term of less than a year in a county jail or both. The punishment for a felony is usually a term of a year or more in a penitentiary, but in some juris- dictions the maximum can be death. Larceny or theft, which is stealing (without personal contact or forcible en- try), can be either a misdemeanor or a felony, depending on the value of the loot. Statutes, varying in the fifty states, determine which category a crime fits. (In some places, traffic or other minor misdeeds are variously categorized as in- fractions, offenses, or violations. They bring only fines and often are not consid- ered crimes.) In popular usage—and even in some formal contexts—“crime” means felony. Any talk about “the crime issue” or “crime on the streets” or “a life of crime” is not likely to concern the com- mission of misdemeanors. Just be aware that crime and misdemeanor are not op- posites. The U.S. Constitution uses the term high crimes for what are usually called felonies. It requires the removal from of- fice of any federal officer impeached for and convicted of “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” So misdemeanors are in infamous com- pany.

MAYHEM, MURDER, and MANSLAUGHTER. 5. TREASON and ESPIONAGE. 1. ASSAULT and RAPE If Joe tries to strike Mary but misses or if he merely threatens to hurt her physically and Mary has a reasonable fear that he will carry out the threat, he has committed assault. If he actually strikes her, he has committed assault and battery. Unlawful sexual intercourse imposed by a male on a female against her will or without her consent is rape. It is rape also if the female, willing or not, is under an age specified by law. (In some states, forcible sodomy on either sex also is considered rape. ) The press long avoided that word, substituting various imprecise terms, like “assaulting” and “molest- ing.” Readers in modern times usually, but not always, get more precision. This is from the lead paragraph of a news story: At an emotional hearing Friday, a 36 -year-old Los Angeles man dubbed the “Flat-Tire Rapist” was sentenced to 113 years and seven life terms for assaults on 11 women. . . . To say that a man who forcibly copu- lated with eleven women committed “as- saults” is at best a gross understatement. Nobody would be sentenced to a lifetime in prison for simply assaulting people. The next paragraph recounts the man’s conviction on “ 36 counts of kidnaping, robbing and attacking women. . . .” Kid- napping (also spelled kidnaping ) and robbery are criminal charges. “Attack- ing” is not a criminal charge. Although its use as a euphemism improves upon “assaulting,” which carries a legal mean- ing, consistency and precision would have been best. The writer braced up ini- tially to mention the culprit’s sobriquet but otherwise seemed to be too squeam- ish to display any form of rape in the ar- ticle’s seventeen paragraphs, so he let “attack” and “assault” fill in five times. 2. BLACKMAIL and EXTORTION “When to Stop Oil Blackmail: Now.” A headline over an editorial in a promi- nent daily so declared. “There isn’t any question that there was blackmail,” the governor of Wyoming said about his state’s raising the drinking age from 19 to 21 to avoid losing federal highway funds. “The only reason we’ve got any speed limit at all is Federal blackmail, pure and simple,” a Montana state senator said. “It is blackmail, pure and simple,” the host of a news commentary program said of the so-called Unibomber’s de- mand for publicity. In each case, no “blackmail” had been committed. Strictly speaking, blackmail is not just any kind of pressure or coer- cion. It is not limiting oil production to raise prices. It is not using federal funds to induce states to enact certain laws. It is not threatening violence to exact a payment or an action. Blackmail is an attempt to obtain money by threatening to disclose infor- mation about someone. Jane commits blackmail when she demands $ 5 , 000 from John for not telling his wife about his double life. The payment too can be called blackmail. A popular synonym is hush money. People often loosely use “blackmail” when they are talking about extortion. The exact meaning of extortion varies from state to state. It may be limited to an official’s misuse of his position or power to obtain money or property, or it may encompass any person’s obtaining of payment through coercion, intimida- tion, or threat. Some states use the term blackmail only when the threat of disclo- sure is in writing; when it is oral, the crime is considered a form of extortion. crimes (various felonies) 85 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 85"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Related verbs (transitive) are to black- mail (someone) and to extort (money from someone). 3. BURGLARY, ROBBERY, and THEFT All of these excerpts from news stories show the same confusion: . . . Two of those patrons were police officers in search of a burglary sus- pect. . . . [They] later found out the robbery call was a phony. LIMA, Peru—Slum dwellers tied a man accused of burglary to a 40 -foot wooden cross. . . . A—— had been caught robbing a home . . . the report said. . . . While she and her husband were away from home . . . burglars entered their house. . . . In the previous month there had been 32 similar robberies in just that one suburban neighborhood. The search for a “burglary suspect” would not be prompted by a “robbery call.” The Peruvian “accused of bur- glary,” even if guilty, had not engaged in “robbing.” And if the “burglars” had committed similar crimes, the crimes were not “robberies.” It is a common mistake to call a burglary a “robbery” or to say “I’ve been robbed” when one’s home has been burglarized and no rob- bery has been committed. If someone breaks into your house or apartment with intent to commit a crime, he is committing a burglary, which is a felony. Depending on the state, breaking into a commercial estab- lishment also may constitute burglary. The standard verb (transitive) is to bur- glarize. To burgle (verb, transitive and intransitive), a relative newcomer, has been used mostly in humorous contexts, such as the title of a novel by P. G. Wode- house, Do Butlers Burgle Banks? Robbery, another felony, is theft from a person, or in one’s presence, by vio- lence or the threat of violence. If a crimi- nal steals someone’s money or property by striking the victim or threatening to harm him, with or without a weapon, he has committed a robbery. A perpetration that begins as a burglary can become a robbery as well if the culprit confronts an occupant of the building he has en- tered and threatens or harms him. A person or place is robbed; that which is taken is stolen. If robbers prey on a bank, for example, they rob the bank and steal a sum of money. The bank is robbed of the money. If the cul- prits are armed, they can be said to hold up an establishment or a person. It or he is held up; there has been a holdup or hold-up. Slangy synonyms are stick up (verb) and stickup or stick-up (noun). What go up are victims’ hands. Another example shows the two crimes confused in another way. On Hal- loween a sign at a convenience store re- quested that customers not wear masks when entering. A television newscaster tried to explain: “They want to make sure that burglars don’t take advantage of the holiday.” Robbers, not “burglars.” “What you’re about to see is robbery in broad daylight,” a television reporter said. What he showed was not a “rob- bery” but a pocket-picking. As long as force is negligible, it is a form of larceny, which is common stealing or theft. If the pickpocket jostles his victim or uses other substantial force, the crime be- comes a robbery. In some states, the term larceny or theft includes more elaborate schemes for stealing, such as embezzle- ment, obtaining property by false pre- tenses, and swindling. Larceny or theft is usually divided into two grades, depend- ing on the value of the property stolen: grand, a felony, and petty (or petit ), a misdemeanor. A mugging is an unexpected, violent attack on a person with the intent of committing robbery. To mug someone is to assault and batter the person with in- tent to rob. It is not a synonym for rob, 86 crimes (various felonies) 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 86"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"as it was misused in a news story: “The students and parents . . . told tales of be- ing . . . mugged of the chocolate they were selling as a school fund-raiser. . . .” They could be robbed of the chocolate. However, one is not “mugged of” any- thing; and the story did not say if a sur- prise attack preceded the robbery, making for a mugging. 4. MAYHEM, MURDER, and MAN- SLAUGHTER In a preview of a local news telecast, an announcer spoke of criminals’ “anger at society exploding in murderous may- hem.” Then a newspaper columnist de- scribed violence on New Year’s Eve and commented that “this kind of mayhem” could not be blamed on freedom. Next, readers of an editorial were told, “Sense- less mayhem is no monopoly of the Japanese cult” (as though there could be sensible mayhem). Last, a reporter on national television, outdoing others in alliteration, said the Colombia drug car- tel dealt in “money, murder, and may- hem.” The newscasts, the column, and the editorial told of no case of mayhem; no one seemed to know what it meant. Although some use it vaguely instead of words like havoc, violence, or destruc- tion, mayhem is a particular felony. It is the act of intentionally depriving a per- son of a bodily member or function, or otherwise crippling, disfiguring, maim- ing, or mutilating him. For instance, one who willfully blinds another is guilty of mayhem. The crime may become murder if the victim dies as a result of the attack. Murder is the malicious and unlawful killing of a human being with intent to kill, or without intent to kill but done during the commission of another felony, such as robbery. It makes no dif- ference if the one killed was not the in- tended victim. An unlawful killing, even if it is inten- tional, is not murder but manslaughter if the perpetrator had reasonable provo- cation and felt no malice toward the victim. An unintentional killing is man- slaughter if it is committed in the course of a misdemeanor, say the disregarding of a traffic signal. Homicide is the killing of one human being by another, whether unlawful or lawful. The term takes in murder, manslaughter, and legally justifiable killings. Statutes condone homicide when it is committed in self-defense, or by an insane person, or as a necessary duty by a law-enforcement officer. (Of course, all those definitions pertain to American law. Military acts have to do with jungle law.) 5. TREASON and ESPIONAGE A columnist quoted a senator, who was challenging a nominee for secretary of defense: “He knew the confidential negotiating positions . . . right after he got through [participating in arms control negotiations], he immediately went to work for defense contractors.” I put that latest charge to John Tower after Sunday’s televised broad- sides: Did he sell that confidential in- formation about fallback positions to clients, as Senator Nunn clearly im- plied? “That would be treason,” said Mr. Tower sharply. For an American to sell confidential U.S. military information to American mili- tary contractors would not be “trea- son.” Treason is an act of armed revolt or wartime betrayal. If an American sold such information to a foreign representa- tive, either in wartime or in peacetime, he could be charged with espionage, a form of spying. In another incident, the Central Intel- ligence Agency discovered that one of its spies was also a spy for the Russians. A television interview with a newspaper re- porter specializing in intelligence matters produced this dialogue: crimes (various felonies) 87 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 87"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"[Host:] Why don’t they execute him? [Guest:] We don’t have a death penalty for treason. “Treason” had nothing to do with it. Es- pionage was the crime. The statement is also wrong on a second score: The maxi- mum penalty for treason is death, under a federal statute. Another such statute provides a maximum penalty of death for espionage too, but only when the in- formation obtained has been delivered to a foreign government. Two network news women, within three months in 1997 , made the erro- neous statement that Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were “executed for treason” in 1953 . Actually the couple were con- victed of espionage, not “treason.” The alleged deed was the passing of atomic secrets to the U.S.S.R., when it was an ally of the U.S. (One speaker was prefac- ing an interview with a one-time mem- ber of the Soviet spying agency, who said that no atomic secrets were passed and that Ethel was not a spy.) Espionage is the obtaining—and often the delivery to a foreign government as well—of secret American military or de- fense information with intent to injure the United States. In many a country, “treason” or its linguistic equivalent is whatever the ruler says it is. In the United States, treason is what the Constitution says it is: only “levying war against them” (the United States) or “adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort.” Convic- tion, under the Constitution, requires “the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act” or “confession in open court.” Despite the constitutional prescrip- tion, those seeking to stain adversaries sometimes apply the “treason” brush with broad strokes. Senator Joseph R. McCarthy once accused the Democratic Party of “twenty years of treason.” A former federal administrator called American lawyers for foreign drug cartelists “traitors.” A letter in a news- paper termed the campaign of the reli- gious right “treason.” Protesters against President Clinton carried signs accusing him of “treason” for actions concerning China. Treason has to do with war. In miscel- laneous decisions, courts have ruled that all these circumstances are essential for conviction: ( 1 ) a person either takes up arms against the United States or sup- ports the enemy after a war formally be- gins; ( 2 ) in the latter event, he both takes the side of the enemy and gives the enemy aid and comfort; ( 3 ) the aid and comfort is in an overt act; ( 4 ) he in- tends to betray this country; ( 5 ) he is a U.S. citizen; and ( 6 ) the war formally begins with a declaration of war by Congress. CRISIS. See CRITICAL. CRITERIA and CRITERION. The noun criteria is a plural form of cri- terion, a standard or rule on which one bases a judgment or decision. An alter- native plural is criterions. It is incorrect to speak of “a criteria” or say “the crite- ria is.” Thus it was a mistake to report on a radio network that “the Chinese have a very strict criteria for what they want” in trade. Depending on the meaning in- tended, the reporter should have either omitted the “a” (“the Chinese have very strict criteria”) or used criterion (“the Chinese have a very strict criterion”). When a TV panelist said, about a ban on discrimination by some New York clubs, “I think the criteria is 400 mem- bers,” unquestionably “criteria” should have been criterion. Criterion comes from Greek and re- tains the Greek plural ending. See also Plurals and singulars, 2E. CRITICAL. 1. Concerning crises. 2.

Concerning crises A mayor was shot in Japan, and a story in a New York newspaper included this sentence: The Mayor, Hitoshi Motoshima, was reported in critical condition but out of danger tonight after two hours of surgery. If he was in “critical” condition, how could he be “out of danger” at the same time? Critical in such a context normally means dangerous; it pertains to a crisis, a crucial point when the course of a dis- ease—or anything else—can turn in ei- ther a favorable or an unfavorable direction. Could the report have lost something in translation? 2. Concerning criticism etc. Critical (adjective) has an assortment of other meanings, among them crucial, decisive, perilous, and referring to im- portant products or materials that are in short supply. In the sense of judging, critical is not necessarily negative. It can mean charac- terized by careful and objective judg- ment or it can pertain to formal criticism. Popularly it is more often con- strued as judging unfavorably or in- clined to judge unfavorably. A Nevada newspaper ran the headline “Man is critical after car goes into canal.” The text beneath it indicated that the only person in the car was a woman. Maybe that critical man was the owner. See also CONDITION. CRY. See -Y ending. CULMINATE. To culminate means to reach the highest point or the climax of something. How not to use this verb is illustrated by a press excerpt. The razing of the International Hotel . . . culminated a crisis that eventually touched virtually every agency. . . . Change “culminate” to ended. The ex- ample is wrong on two scores: To culmi- nate does not mean to end or to be the outcome. Moreover, it is an intransitive verb, not transitive; one does not “cul- minate” something. Although culminate(d) does belong in the sentence below, the preposition that follows it is not idiomatic. ...A gr owing body of scientific evidence on the dangers of so-called secondhand smoke has culminated with an influential Environmental Protection Agency report declaring environmental smoke a “Class A Car- cinogen.” . . . Make it “culminated in. ” The verb is normally followed by in, not “with.” CUM. Cum, Latin for with, appears in hyphenated combinations in this man- ner: “En route, don’t miss St. Francis Fountain, a Mission landmark lunch- counter-cum-candy shop, founded in 1918 .” It becomes a high-flown substi- tute for together with or simply and, mystifying many readers who would un- derstand “lunch counter and candy shop.” (The piling up of two modifiers as well as the compound further compli- cates the sample. See Modifiers, 4. ) The u in cum may be pronounced the short way—inviting confusion with come —or like the oo in book. CUSTOM. As an adjective, custom means specially made for an individual customer (a custom suit) or doing work to order (a custom tailor). A label and a leaflet accompanying a mass-produced blanket say the product was “CUSTOM LOOMED” by a cer- tain manufacturer. As used in commerce, the word is usually empty puffery. custom 89 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 89"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Danglers. See Modifers, 1. DARING. A radio network broadcast this phrase: “A daring escape from a medium-security facility outside of Pueblo.” It lacks Colorado and a verb. ( See Sentence fragment ). The main trou- ble, though, is that daring is a word of praise; it commends one’s adventurous- ness, initiative, boldness, and fearless- ness in a risky endeavor. Take the “daring young man on the flying trapeze,” the subject of song since 1868 . Although no adjective was really needed, a better one would have been brazen or imitative. (The method of es- cape, by helicopter, had been used before and, still earlier, portrayed in a movie.) In a comparable nonsentence, “A dar- ing daylight robbery on a busy San Fran- cisco street” was reported on local television. The same crime was “a dar- ing holdup” on local radio. And when criminals stealthily murdered a guard and wounded two people before rob- bing a bank, a newspaper described “a daring holdup.” If those crimes required an adjective, ruthless would have been preferable, but why did the facts have to be embellished at all? Dash. See Punctuation, 4. DATA. A historian is quoted, by a book critic, on newly revealed records of the erstwhile Soviet Union: “On the other hand, the data in the archives doesn’t reveal the sense that there’s a broad plan afoot to take over Eastern Europe.” Is the sentence right or wrong? As a Latin plural, data traditionally was strictly a plural in English. Thus “The data in the archives don’t reveal . . .” Data are pieces of information, particu- larly raw facts or figures used as the ba- sis for conclusions or judgments. Many educated people, particularly in the United States, now use the word as a collective singular (as the historian uses it); many do not. You cannot go wrong construing data as plural, partic- ularly in any formal use. The traditional singular of data is da- tum, which is used much less often than circumlocutions like an item in the data. “A data” will offend many pairs of eyes or ears. And “this data” can be ambigu- ous: Does it mean one item or all the items? Fact or figure usually will do for a singular. If you do choose to use data as a col- lective singular, at least be consistent. These two sentences appear in two con- secutive paragraphs in a scientific jour- nal: The demographic data obtained from the present updated sample is very consistant with that found in the initial reports. . . . 90 danglers D 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 90"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"These data represent a two-edged sword.

She [Princess Pauahi] saw native Ha- waiians literally decimated—reduced in number from 400 , 000 to 40 , 000 . If Hawaiians had been “literally deci- mated,” as a speaker said on television, they would have been reduced in num- ber from 400 , 000 to 360 , 000 . The literal meaning of decimate is to destroy a tenth part of something; specif- ically, in Roman times, to kill one in ev- ery ten of an army or a group, each victim having been selected by lot. The word comes from Latin, in which dec- imus means tenth. Decimal has the same source. If the word “literally” and the num- bers had been left out, decimated could have been used in a looser sense: to de- stroy a substantial part of something measurable by number. This appeared in a letter to the editor: The shortsighted exploitation of a rain forest like that of Sarawak—a 160 -million-year-old ecosystem that has been decimated by 50 percent in only a few decades and will be gone forever in another 10 years—is not the right of any country. In the light of its origin, decimate should not go with a number—unless used liter- ally to mean eliminate 10 percent. Nu- merous other verbs are available in place of “been decimated” in the second sam- ple: diminished, dwindled, been cut, been reduced, been halved (omitting “by 50 percent”), and so on. A senator wrote a colleague that the latter’s “wish to decimate the bill by an additional 20 percent cut in acreage is unacceptable.” Perhaps weaken or en- feeble was meant. Decimate should not be used in lieu of annihilate or demolish or modified by completely, totally, or the like; nor should it be applied to something ab- stract or incalculable. To “decimate his argument” or “decimate their enthusi- asm” is meaningless. Declarative sentence. See Backward writing; (-) EVER, 1. DECRESCENDO. See CRES- CENDO. DEER, plural.

A writer does not consciously aim to dehumanize someone in writing but can do so through fuzzy thinking that equates a human being with an abstraction or a statistic. The ex- ample is from a newspaper column: Smith, by the way, was the first en- dorsement under the new POA policy of polling all of the station houses be- fore making a decision. A person is not an “endorsement.” The sentence can be improved: “Smith, by dehumanization 91 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 91"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"the way, was the first person endorsed under . . .” or “ Smith’s endorsement, by the way, was the first under . . .” This is from a front-page news story in another paper: He was the 14 th homicide of the year in the crack-ridden 34 th precinct. “He was the 14 th homicide victim of the year . . .” or “ His killing was the 14 th homicide of the year. . . .” A victim is not a homicide. Homicide is the killing of one human being by another. (General dictio- naries contain a secondary definition of homicide as a person who kills another, a meaning that is nearly obsolete.) In an autobiography, a general draws on military jargon to describe plans for a bombing attack on Baghdad: The hour was also selected to mini- mize collateral damage, since most Iraqis would be at home. . . . By “collateral damage” he means the killing of civilian people. See also DETERIORATE; FATAL- ITY; FEWER and LESS, 2. DELUGED. See INUNDATE, IN- UNDATED. DELUSION and ILLUSION. See Confusing pairs. DEMOCRACY, FREEDOM, and INDEPENDENCE. The three words are not synonymous, contrary to the im- plication of this sentence, from an edito- rial: Students in communist China sought a bit of independence and democracy and paid with their blood to learn that freedom is not in a dicta- tor’s dictionary. The part of the sentence about “free- dom” does not follow reasonably from the part about “independence and democracy.” Three concepts have been confused. Democracy, in theory, is a political system in which the people rule. The term also denotes a system of govern- ment by elected representatives of the people. Freedom means the state of being free from restraints or being free from official oppression or being able to do what one wants. Independence means complete auton- omy, nationhood, not being under for- eign rule. The world has many independent dic- tatorships. Citizens of some autocracies have a degree of freedom, perhaps eco- nomic or religious, without democracy. Citizens of some politically free coun- tries may lack certain democratic rights, such as the control of foreign relations. And sometimes people democratically decide to curb some freedoms, say, for certain businesses or offenders. DEMOCRAT and DEMOCRA- TIC. It is ungrammatical to use the noun in place of the adjective, yet it is frequently done intentionally. A rhetori- cal question posed by a Republican leader in the House of Representatives is typical: “When did we start signing on to any Democrat agenda?” Democratic. The adjective ends in ic, whether we use democratic (with lower case d ), per- taining to democracy, or Democratic (with capital D ), pertaining to the Democratic Party. The word democrat is a noun only, meaning one who believes in democracy; the name Democrat is a noun only, meaning one who adheres to the Democratic Party. In the fifties, certain Republican politicos began mangling the name of the opposition party by referring to the “Democrat Party” or the “Democrat candidate,” on grounds that no one should think of it as the only democratic party. So far the Democrats have not re- 92 deluged 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 92"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"ciprocated the suffix-scrapping by speak- ing of the “Republic Party.” The silliness has persisted and spread beyond Republican politics. A headline in a national newspaper read, “Demo- crat Sluggers Are Benched.” There was enough space to add two letters, so the newspaper had no excuse for truncating the proper adjective. The normally non- partisan moderator of a news forum on television wrongly referred to a “Demo- crat plan” instead of a “ Democratic plan” or a “plan by Democrats. ” Actually, Americans give scant thought to any meaning behind the names Republican and Democratic, which offer no clue as to current ideo- logical differences. Both parties favor a democratic republic. The party that is now Democratic was called Democratic Republican in our republic’s youth, when such terms had more meaning. DEMOLISH. When you demolish an object, you tear it to pieces, burn it up, or knock it into a shapeless mass. A qualification like “entirely,” in the fol- lowing sentence, or “completely” or “to- tally” is superfluous; it is implied in demolish(ed). “The front end of his car is reported to be entirely demolished.” Demolish (verb, transitive) implies vi- olent destruction; destroy, completeness of ruin or wreckage and the ending of something’s usefulness, if not existence; raze, leveling to the ground; and ruin, spoiling and badly damaging but not an- nihilating. Demolition (noun) is a demolishing, a destruction. A synonym, less common, is demolishment. See also DEVASTATE, DEVASTAT- ING; RUIN and RUINS. DEPRECATE and DEPRECIATE. See Confusing pairs. DESECRATE, DESECRATION. The Latin sacrare, to make sacred, or holy, is the root of this word. Prefixed by de, removal or reversal, desecrate (verb, transitive) literally means to divest of sa- cred character or to use in a profane way that which is sacred. A church has been desecrated if it is turned into a private house. A religious emblem has been des- ecrated if it becomes a T-shirt design. To treat with sacrilege, or lack of reverence, also is to desecrate. A man who wears a hat in a church (or no hat in a syna- gogue) could be accused of desecrating it. So could one who burns it. The opposite of desecrate is conse- crate, to establish as sacred. The related nouns are desecration and consecration, respectively. When Congress discussed a proposed constitutional amendment that would authorize legislation “to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States,” it was essentially consid- ering the physical consecration of that flag, its establishment as a sacred object. One can desecrate only that which is sa- cred. Probably what the sponsors had meant was the malicious destruction or damaging of an American flag. DESERT and DESSERT. Desert is the sandy wasteland, pronounced DEZ- urt. When we insert an s, we get dessert, the sweet end of a meal. It is pronounced dih-ZURT, the same as the verb desert, meaning to abandon. The words are mixed up sometimes. In a manual of English for newcomers, this was printed: “ Waitress: What would you like for desert?” (The answer could have been “sand tarts” but was not.) Later, a celebrated anchor man an- nounced that Gerald Ford, newly retired as president, was visiting Southern Cali- fornia’s warm “dessert country.” (It was not announced whether Ford was given an executive sweet.)

Literally, one cannot choose, control, or decide one’s destiny. Nor can destinies be withheld or changed. A book quoted a professor as saying, “We have been de- nied our Polish destiny” ( heritage? ). A big headline proclaimed “HONG KONG’S NEW DESTINY.” (There was new rule, predetermined by two na- tions.) By definition, destiny is one’s in- evitable lot; or, in a broader sense, a pre- determined course of events or a power that predetermines events. (Explaining the meaning of destiny does not imply that there really is such a thing.) Synonyms for destiny are fate and for- tune. However, they have additional meanings that bypass the question of pre- determination. Fate, like destiny, often is used loosely to signify merely an out- come or final result or future; sometimes it specifically means an unfavorable out- come. Fortune often denotes good or bad luck, particularly the good; it can also mean financial success or wealth. The verb destine (transitive), usually used in the passive, destined, can imply predetermination, or it can suggest no more than intend(ed) for a particular end or head(ed) for a particular destina- tion. Destination occasionally means a predetermined end or a destining. More often it is merely a place toward which a traveler or a moving object is headed. See also INEVITABLE. DESTROY. See DEMOLISH. DETERIORATE. The verb deterio- rate, meaning to make (something) worse or to become worse, has five sylla- bles (pronounced dih-TIER-ee-uh-rate). The adjective deteriorating, becoming worse, has six syllables (dih-TIER-ee-uh- rate-ing). Omitting the o syllable and the r sound is a fault of some speakers: On TV, a visitor to a zoo said “it started to deteriate” years ago and a senator said about the North Koreans, “They are a deteriating economy.” (They are not an economy. Better: “They have a deterio- rating economy.”) Deterioration, noun (dih-tier-ee-uh- RAY-shn), is the process of deteriorating or the condition of having deteriorated. DEVASTATE, DEVASTATING. “A devastating earthquake on Guam,” a newscaster announced on television (in a nonsentence of the type so beloved by newscasters). “Nobody was killed and nobody was left homeless,” she added. To devastate (verb, transitive) is to lay waste. Devastating (adjective) means ut- terly destructive. The two words imply widespread ruin and desolation. If an earthquake took no lives or houses, how could it be “devastating”? It was announced on another televi- sion program: “An American city has been totally devastated.” A qualification such as “totally” or “entirely” is super- fluous; it is implied in devastated.

The preposition that follows When a preposition follows different, normally it is from.

Tragedies . . . have led many South Africans to suspect that the new South Africa is no different than the old. Change “than” to from in both state- ments (uttered by network television re- porters). Than generally follows only comparative words —bigger than, faster than—and different is not one of them. It is a positive adjective, except in rare cases. Grammatically, you cannot go wrong with different from. Yet some writers and grammatical authorities have found different than acceptable under certain circumstances, perhaps even preferable from the standpoint of style. They allow than when a clause or implied clause fol- lows and when using from properly would result in a more complicated sen- tence. For example: “The practice of medicine takes a different form in Japan than [it takes] in the United States.” In- stead of than, you could substitute “from that which it takes,” or something of that sort, remaining technically cor- rect but complicating the sentence. The choice is not just between from and than. The message can always be ex- pressed differently. “Japanese physicians do not practice medicine in the same way that American physicians do.” Few disagree that when we differenti- ate individual nouns, noun phrases, or pronouns—“Meteors are different from meteorites” or “Big cats are much differ- ent from little cats”—the only preposi- tion to use is from, except in Britain, where “different to ” sometimes is used. The adverb differently is likewise fol- lowed by from: “Canadians do not speak much differently from Ameri- cans.” In listing differences between British English and American English, two En- glish lexicographers present “different from or to” as the British way and “dif- ferent than” as the American way. It is not the standard American way. 2. Unnecessary use Sometimes “different” contributes nothing. Omitting it from an advertise- ment for a newspaper, posted on the side of transit vehicles, might have strength- ened the message: It takes over a million different people over a million different places every day. Different emphasizes unlikeness: “The French and the Germans are much dif- ferent people.” If multiplicity is to be emphasized, many, several, various, or a number, like nine or a million, probably is a better adjective to use: “Many knights attempted to slay the dragon,” not “different knights. . . .” Digits spelled out. See NO WAY, 1; Numbers, 11. DILEMMA. A dilemma is a situation that requires a choice between two equally unpleasant alternatives. The word was borrowed from Greek, di- meaning double and lemma meaning proposition. Where is the dilemma in the following sentence? The social dilemma of teenage pregnancy is growing in Wyoming while the state ranks third in the na- tion, according to a study initiated by Wyoming’s Commission for Women. Neither that sentence nor the rest of the article it is extracted from presents us with a “dilemma.” Teenage pregnancy may be a question, predicament, plight, problem, or social ill, but the writer fails to explain why it is a “dilemma.” (Nor does he explain in what way Wyoming ranks third in the nation.) dilemma 95 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 95"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"The paragraph below does present a true dilemma, one faced by a political party in Israel, although the paragraph has other troubles.

When you dine, you eat dinner. When you eat breakfast, lunch, or sup- per, you breakfast, lunch, or sup, as the case may be. In a magazine article about British tea drinking, this sentence ap- peared: Anna, the seventh Duchess of Bed- ford, typically dined on a huge break- fast, virtually no lunch, and then again at about eight o’clock. One cannot “dine” on breakfast and lunch, let alone “virtually no lunch.” (The sentence also contains a faulty se- ries: “breakfast . . . lunch [both nouns], and then again [adverbial phrase]. . . .” And then again what? The misshapen sentence breaks off, and we have to guess whether another oversized repast or another bird’s portion was in store for the duchess. See Series errors. ) DISASSEMBLE and DISSEMBLE. See Confusing pairs. DISASTER. A disaster is a great mis- fortune, such as a destructive earth- quake, famine, or flood. It is a happening, typically sudden and unex- pected, that causes extraordinary loss of life or property. A news magazine’s treatment of an at- tempted coup in Moscow reduced the word to triviality. It said of a press con- ference by the conspirators, “Their per- formance was a disaster.” It was a failure or fiasco or an inept or bungling per- formance or, in colloquial terms, a flop or a dud. The article perfunctorily added, “Three demonstrators were left dead. . . .” A book comments on an airline com- pany’s change of name: “It was widely greeted as a disaster.” If that was an air- line “disaster,” the word has lost its meaning. Its loose use to describe any failure may be harmless in informal con- versation but is inappropriately trans- ferred to serious writing or discussion. Disaster (from the Old French desas- tre, from the Old Italian disastro ), re- flects a faith in astrology. Latin provided the negative dis- and astrum, from the Greek astron: a star. See also TRAGEDY. DISCHARGE. See LAY OFF and LAYOFF; LET GO. DISCOMFIT and DISCOMFORT. Inasmuch as the two verbs look similar and sound similar, it is not surprising that people confuse discomfit and dis- comfort. But the words have different meanings and different Latin roots via the old French desconfire, to defeat (past participle: desconfit ), and desconforter, to discomfort. Originally discomfit (verb, transitive) meant to defeat (an enemy) completely in battle. Its strictest use today is still to defeat completely, though not necessar- ily in battle. It can also mean to frustrate (some- 96 diminuendo 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 96"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"one), to foil one’s plans. Such an action is likely to leave a person disconcerted, perplexed, dejected, or humiliated. Opinions diverge on whether ( 1 ) the de- feat or frustration is essential to the meaning or ( 2 ) the mental state alone is enough. At the loosest level we find “discom- fit” used as a mere variation of the verb “discomfort.” You be the judge of whether the latter d- word in this excerpt from a book has any special reason for being: While most buyers of literature don’t think twice about ads that appear in magazines, they find the same ads dis- comfiting in books. Discomfort (verb, transitive) means to make uncomfortable, either physically or mentally; to distress mildly. It is also a noun: an uncomfortable or mildly dis- tressing condition or feeling. The oppo- site is comfort (verb, transitive): to make comfortable, to soothe; and (noun): a comfortable or soothing condition or feeling, or that which produces it. The noun related to the verb discomfit is discomfiture: a state of being discom- fited or, sometimes, the act of discomfit- ing. In Shakespeare’s day the noun also was discomfit. (This is from Henry VI, Part 2: “. . . Uncurable discomfit / Reins in the hearts of all our present parts.”) Comfit is not the opposite of discomfit but a type of confection, a sugared fruit or vegetable. DISCREET and DISCRETE. See Homophones. DISHONOR. See HONORABLE, HONORARY, HONORED. DISINGENUOUS and INGENU- OUS. Ingenuous (adjective) means candid, straightforward, unsophisticat- edly frank. Two talk show hosts, intending to im- pugn statements made in a murder case, used that word instead of its antonym. A TV host called a remark “a little bit in- genuous,” and a radio host said of an- other remark, “That was ingenuous.” Both needed disingenuous: not can- did, not straightforward, insincere. Perhaps the in- (which can mean in as well as not in Latin) is a source of confu- sion. Ingenuous comes from the Latin ingenuus, meaning native, free-born, no- ble, or frank. Ingenuous has been confused with in- genious, which means clever or cunning and originates in the Latin ingenium: in- nate ability. DISINTERESTED and UNIN- TERESTED. What do a book on old Flemish painting and a situation comedy have in common? He [Brueghel] rejected literal imita- tion of the Italians, ignored their sub- ject matter, was disinterested in idealized beauty, had no more taste for nudes than for palatial architec- ture. No matter how disinterested I am, the driver won’t stop yapping away. The answer is the wrong use of “disin- terested.” Change it to uninterested (or, in the first instance, to not interested ): “He . . . was uninterested in idealized beauty . . .” (or “He . . . was not inter- ested . . . ”). / “No matter how uninter- ested I am . . .” The prefixes dis- and un- both mean not. Both adjectives, disinterested and uninterested, mean not interested. But two different meanings of interested ap- ply: 1 . The interested following dis- means possessing a financial interest or a share or seeking personal gain or advan- tage (in or from something, either stated disinterested and uninterested 97 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 97"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"or implied). “All interested parties at- tended the hearing on the proposed re- zoning.” 2 . The interested following un- means having a fascination or curiosity or being concerned or absorbed (for, about, or by something). “She is inter- ested in antique collecting.” These are typical sentences using dis- interested and uninterested: “Members of a governmental board must be disin- terested in its affairs.” / “She is interested in antique collecting, but her husband is uninterested.” A synonym for disinterested is impar- tial. A synonym for uninterested is indif- ferent. For 500 years indifferent meant impartial. Now it commonly means apa- thetic, not caring—which disinterested meant in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. We change the quotations again: “He was indifferent to idealized beauty.” / “No matter how indifferent I am. . . .” Indifferent can also mean mediocre: “Was the movie good, bad, or indifferent?” The noun related to interested is inter- est. It has the meanings of both ( 1 ) finan- cial or personal involvement and ( 2 ) fascination or concern. The noun related to disinterested is disinterest, meaning lack of interest in the first sense. “Disin- terest is an essential quality in a judge.” A noun meaning lack of interest in the second sense is indifference. “Our con- gressman displays indifference to his less affluent constituents.” DISMISS.

A TV panelist said an appointee to a seat on the state supreme court had “received a ‘disqualified’ rating” from the state bar. Actually the bar’s rating was unqualified; the governor was not obligated to observe it and did not. Disqualified means rendered unfit, de- clared ineligible, or deprived of legal right or power. (One is disqualified from entering a contest by being related to the sponsor. A prejudiced juror may be dis- qualified from service.) Unqualified, as used above, means lacking proper or necessary qualifications. In another con- text, it can mean not modified or with- out limitation ( unqualified support) or complete or downright ( unqualified suc- cess). Disqualified is the past participle of disqualify (verb, transitive). Unqualified (adjective) has no corresponding verb. Its antonym is qualified (adjective). DISSEMBLE and DISASSEMBLE. See Confusing pairs. Division of words. The division of a word between lines slows down a reader a bit. With few exceptions, it should be resorted to only in typesetting or callig- raphy and only when the division is nec- essary to justify the right-hand margin (that is, to make it straight) without big gaps in a line. In manuscripts for publication it is best not to divide words at all, lest it be unclear whether the hyphens belong in print or not. To indicate that a hyphen at the end of a line should be printed, an editor underlines the hyphen. Sometimes grotesque divisions are seen in print. A newspaper divided boot- straps into “boots-” and “traps.” One line should have contained boot- (the first syllable plus a hyphen) and the next line straps. Nowadays words are usually divided automatically by computers. An editor can correct a bad division or dis- regard it. No one corrected that one. Another newspaper divided probe into “pro-” and “be.” A one-syllable 98 dismiss 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 98"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"word should never be divided. The divi- sion can throw readers off track, partic- ularly when the pieces have other meanings, as pro- and be do. Any word should be kept intact if di- viding it might mislead readers. When isolated, a part of a word like hasten and often tends to form a word in itself with a different pronunciation ( has-ten and of-ten ). A hyphenated compound, such as hang-up or send-off, should be divided at the hyphen and nowhere else. Yet one was published as “han-” and “gup” and the other as “sen-” and “d-off” in two newspapers. A solid compound, such as nearsighted or woodpecker, is divided between the two words of which it is composed. Two-syllable words should be divided between the syllables. However, a single letter is not split off from the rest of a word. A word like adroit should never be divided, inasmuch as its two syllables are a and droit. One newspaper divided that word into “adr-” and “oit.” The rules, and their exceptions, go on at length, dealing with prefixes, suffixes, consonants, vowels, and double letters. And the American and British systems vary. Words divided according to pro- nunciation in the former ( knowl-edge, democ-racy ) are divided according to derivation in the latter ( know-ledge, demo-cracy ). General dictionaries show possible di- vision points by means of centered dots. The dictionaries do not always agree on where those points are, sometimes because pronunciations differ. It is hi • er • o • glyph • ic in one dictionary, hi • ero • glyph•ic in another; tel • e • phone in the first dictionary, tele • phone in the other. One dictionary makes it gon • a • do • trop • ic, a second go • na • do • tro • pic, a third gonado • trop•ic, and a fourth go • nad • o • trop • ic. Any division of abbreviations, initials, or figures can be confusing and should be avoided. See Numbers, 3. DIVORCÉ, DIVORCÉE, and DI- VORCEE. See BACHELOR and SPINSTER. DO, DID, DONE. The catch phrase “I dood it” belonged to the comedian Red Skelton. Much later, a big-city po- lice chief said, “I think I’ve did a good job,” and a restaurant reviewer said, about meat that one could cut with a fork, “I know because I’ve did it.” Nei- ther man was being funny. Each proba- bly made a slip of the tongue and knew the correct form, “I’ve done it,” meaning I’ve performed it or carried it out, and all these forms of the verb do: Present tense: I, you, we, they do; he, she, it does. Past tense: I, you, etc. did. Future tense: I, you, etc. will do. Perfect tenses: I, you, we, they have or had done; he, she, it has or had done. A helping verb (such as has or is ) usu- ally precedes the past participle done. This broadcast sentence, “What he done was impossible to do”—instead of “What he did ” (dig out of an avalanche)—is ungrammatical. It is also contradictory; what is impossible cannot be done. When it is not ambiguous, done is ac- ceptable as an adjective meaning com- pleted: “My work here is done.” However, in a sentence like “The work will be done next month” it can be un- derstood to mean performed; so if com- pleted or finished is meant, it is better to use one of those words. A facetious term for a mystery tale is a whodunit. This slang noun was coined from the ungrammatical phrase “Who done it?” Had the coiner been more scrupulous about his grammar, people might be reading or watching whodidits.

Don’t is the contraction of do not. It agrees with all plural nouns and with the pronouns I, you, we, and they. “I don’t want” is correct in each quotation, for it is like saying “I do not want.” Similarly you, we, or they don’t want it, just as an- telopes, the Browns, or congressmen don’t want it. The contraction of does not is doesn’t. It agrees with all singular nouns and with the pronouns he, she, and it and other singular pronouns except I and you. So “that [feeling] doesn’t mean.” And there is an “idiot that doesn’t know.” Similarly, he, she, or it doesn’t know, just as an antelope, Mr. Brown, or a congressman doesn’t know. Of course, the full does not may be used instead of each doesn’t. The psychologist said, in a later broadcast, “their child don’t look so good.” Doesn’t or does not.

In choosing words and expressions, beware of the danger of double meaning. A sentence can be inter- preted in a way that was not intended. Even when nobody actually misunder- stands it, the result can sometimes be lu- dicrous, as in the illustrations below. They include boners by seven newspa- pers, three advertisers, two television networks, and others. Among the words in double trouble are appeal, cut, crash, dog, liquidate, poach, spot, and spawn. The trouble may amount to an unperceived coinci- dence, the lurking of a literal meaning behind a figurative use, an overambi- tious metaphor, the intrusion of a differ- ent meaning for the same word, an unfortunate juxtaposition, a metaphoric contradiction, or the emerging of a true meaning from a corrupted meaning. Take the contemporary newspaper headline that said: “U.S. Grant Will Help Vets in State Get Jobs.” How much help can he give? He has been out of of- fice since 1877 . A banner headline in another newspa- per told of “Governor’s Plan to Cut Gas Lines.” It appeared during a gasoline shortage, when motorists were lining up at service stations. But one could visual- ize the governor, a critic of the gas com- pany, wielding an ax and whacking away at the company’s pipes. Telling of a $ 20 million show in New York conducted by General Motors, the automobile maker, a TV network re- porter said, “GM went on a crash pro- gram to put this one on fast.” It is doubtful that the company appreciated his use of the word “crash.” After John DeLorean’s car company had run up a $ 50 million debt, some 400 creditors petitioned for liquidation. One newspaper’s coverage of the story in- cluded a picture of the gentleman and a headline reading: “Judge asked to liqui- date DeLorean.” Shades of Stalinism! The main headline in another newspa- per read: “PLO appeals to U.S.” But probably few in the U.S. found the Pales- tine Liberation Organization very ap- pealing.

There is something magical in the ‘act’ of taking a wide vari- ety of ingredients and—voilà!—later pulling from the oven a rabbit that bears a remarkable resemblance to an exquisitely broiled fish or a thoroughly forbidding dessert.” A broiled rabbit that resembled a fish and could pass for a dessert would be remarkable indeed, even to a nonaddict. What did the Japanese prime minister report and why did an American news- paper insult him? It ran a four-column headline: “ ‘Womanizing’ reports dog Uno.” A news service reported that a five- inch-long egg, laid by a condor at the Los Angeles Zoo, “was spotted early Easter Sunday morning”—with colorful polka dots for the day’s festivities? In reporting on teenage pregnancy in Wyoming, a newspaper told of activities of the state’s Commission for Women: “Conferences like the one in Riverton have spawned other action in Lovell, Cody, Riverton and Thermopolis.” Was the commission prepared for all that spawning? An article by an Alaskan senator protesting the catching of salmon off North America by fishermen from the Far East was headed: “Save the Salmon From Poachers.” It raised an obvious question to gourmets: What’s wrong with poached salmon? Another headline said, “Official rips textbooks under review.” One could imagine her sitting at a desk and tearing pages from a pile of school books. This was heard on a national TV newscast: “In the forefront of women’s golf, fame is the name of the game.” I thought the name of the game was golf. Within several days, three com- mercials for motor vehicles treated the television audience to an unusual demonstration of truth in advertising. An announcer said 2 , 000 Dodge vans were for sale, “but they won’t last long.” He did not state the precise life ex- pectancy of each vehicle. Another man, speaking for Acura, forecast an “old- fashioned, year-end blowout,” though presumably the tires would hold for most of the year. And a third said, “Chrysler Corporation announces an in- credible lease opportunity on the Chrysler Concord.” Some commercial claims are indeed incredible. See also Metaphoric contradiction. Double negative. 1. ANY, NO, NOTHING. 2. Carelessness. 3. Un- sound effects. 1. ANY, NO, NOTHING In some languages double negatives are considered proper. For instance, “I have no money” in Spanish is Yo no tengo ningún dinero. The literal transla- tion is “I don’t have no money,” which in English is considered ungrammatical; to make it grammatical, either scrap the “don’t” or change “no” to any. The English-speaking tradition is that a double negative is vulgar and im- proper, unless the speaker wants one negative to cancel the other and thereby produce a positive. A sentence like the sample above can have only one nega- double negative 101 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 101"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"tive: either before the verb or before its object. Thus a radio host, wanting listeners to stay tuned, erred by saying, “Don’t go no where,” instead of any where. An investigative correspondent was in error when he told a television audience that the cause of a plane crash did not appear to be mechanical; there was “no distress call, no ‘mayday,’ no nothing.” Two decades earlier, Jimmy Carter had made a similar mistake during a debate with President Ford: If the Arab countries ever again de- clare an embargo . . . I would not ship . . . [them] anything—no weapons, no spare parts . . . no oil pipe, no nothing. In both instances, the last “no” should have been scrapped. (Another mistake is in mood. Either make “declare” de- clared or change “would” to will. See Subjunctive; Tense, 4C. ) Carter’s gram- mar did not noticeably hurt him; he was narrowly elected. Ford’s verbal blunders had been worse. H. L. Mencken wrote: “Like most other examples of ‘bad grammar’ en- countered in American, the compound negative is of great antiquity and was once quite respectable.” Chaucer used it freely. It appears in some Shakespeare plays. ( Romeo and Juliet: “I will not budge for no man’s pleasure.”) Mencken had kind words for it: Obviously, “I won’t take nothing ” is stronger than either “I will take noth- ing ” or “I won’t take anything. ” And equally without doubt there is a pic- turesque charm, if not really any extra vigor in the vulgar American . . . “She never goes hardly nowhere ” [a triple negative] . . . and “ Ain’t nobody there. . . .” Note that Mencken’s own negative is properly singular. Despite his finding of strength and charm in the multiple nega- tive, it is significant that he did not use it in his own writing. See also BUT, 2, 3; NEITHER, 2. 2. Carelessness The double negative is sometimes a result of carelessness or hastiness, hence understandably more common in speak- ing than in writing. A television weatherman said, “I wouldn’t be a bit surprised if we didn’t find some anomalies there.” The literal meaning of the sentence is that complete normality (in the weather) would not surprise him at all. Probably he meant the opposite: “I wouldn’t be a bit sur- prised if we found some anomalies there,” or “I would be surprised if we didn’t find some anomalies there.” This was heard in television coverage of rural fires: “No smoking bans were in effect.” It was ambiguous. If the “no” applied to “smoking bans,” the sentence meant that no bans on smoking were in effect. If the “no” applied just to “smok- ing,” there was a “ ‘no-smoking’ ban,” which, logically, would be the opposite of a smoking ban. The newscaster prob- ably meant to say, “Bans on smoking were in effect,” which would have avoided the double negative of “no” and “bans.” A university’s journalism dean was criticized for hiring a prominent person as a teacher. A newspaper trade magazine quoted the dean on his hiring practices: We do not pay our outsiders nowhere near what they are worth and in somewhat different amounts. “Not” and “nowhere” together make a double negative. Furthermore, the “not” carries over to “in somewhat different amounts,” negating the phrase. Omit- ting the “not” (or, better, “do not”) cor- rects both problems. Alternatively, change “nowhere” to anywhere; and af- ter “and,” insert we pay them. See also NOT, 1G. 102 double negative 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 102"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"3. Unsound effects A newspaper story (about computer interviews) carried the headline “I can’t get no interaction.” Perhaps the writer of the headline knew better and was try- ing to achieve some kind of effect, be- sides the effect of making the newspaper seem illiterate and causing hundreds of English teachers to grimace in pain. A two-word sentence fragment with two negatives was put in a column and a book. (The column complained about the poor quality of television “pool” coverage of the U.S. invasion of Panama. The book looked askance at the popular use of a word.) Amateur photographers subbing for the big guys? Not hardly. I’m sure you are (it is, they will, etc.). Is the sayer really sure? Not hardly. Hardly would have been enough, for in such contexts it means probably not. Pre- ceding it with “not” doubled the negative. Not all sentences with multiple nega- tives are no good; the present one is grammatical though graceless. “We are not unmindful of your problem, but . . .” is not so much graceless as heartless. A brave, bleeding athlete re- marks, “It’s nothing,” and his coach re- sponds correctly, “It’s not ‘nothing.’ ” And an old song that went “No, no, a thousand times no!” got the negative message across effectively. Even when used correctly, perhaps as a device for deliberate understatement, a sentence with multiple negatives may not be instantly comprehensible. “I would not be unhappy if the people did not en- dorse his leadership” is more clearly ex- pressed in a positive way. “I would try to remain cheerful if the people rejected his leadership,” or other words to that effect, would be easier to grasp.

He was also a philosopher, politi- cian, and theologian, and in the 1760 s he wrote The Rudiments of English Grammar. In clear prose that holds to this day, he pointed out an accepted anomaly of English usage: In some cases we use both the genitive [possessive] and the preposition of, as, this book of my friend’s. Sometimes, indeed, this method is quite necessary, in order to distinguish the sense . . . . This picture of my friend, and this pic- ture of my friend’s, suggest very differ- ent ideas. . . . Where this double genitive, as it may be called, is not necessary to distinguish the sense, and especially in grave style, it is generally omitted. The double possessive, also known as the double genitive, remains idiomatic. Literally the ’s in a phrase like that cat of his sister’s is redundant, inasmuch as the of has already indicated possession, and a few writers on usage look askance on the form. Roy H. Copperud advises those finding a friend of my uncle neater and more logical than a friend of my un- cle’s to use the former even though the latter is long-established idiom and not considered wrong. Nobody minds when the possessive is a pronoun instead of a noun: friends of mine and a dress of hers. Nobody is likely to say “friends of me ” or “a dress of her. ” In writing, ( 1 ) an opinion of the doc- tor and ( 2 ) an opinion of the doctor’s have two different meanings. First, the opinion concerns the doctor; second, the opinion is held by the doctor. In speak- ing, the possessive form would be am- biguous, “the doctor’s” sounding like “the doctors.” Better: an opinion held by the doctor. In the view of Eric Partridge, scrupu- double possessive 103 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 103"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"lous writers avoid that form when the possessive is a noun, especially a plural noun; they remember “the very sound rule that a piece of writing should be as clear to a listener as to a reader”; at least a writer or speaker must be sure that the context makes the reference clear. Doubling of letters. See Spelling, 3B. DOWN. See Numbers, 1. “DOWNPLAY.” See PLAY DOWN and “DOWNPLAY.” DRAFT. Draft or draught (British spelling) comes from the Old English dragan, meaning to draw, pull. When ap- plied to a beverage, draft is the drawing of liquid from its receptacle, as beer or ale from a cask. The beverage is avail- able on draft. “GENUINE DRAFT” as seen on beer cans and in ads is meaningless. To see a genuine draft, go to your nearest tavern. By definition, draft beer is not bottled or canned. Draft has another connection with fluid: Among many other meanings (like an air current, a check for money, mili- tary conscription, a preliminary text, etc.), it is a swallowing or the portion of liquid swallowed. DRAGGED and “DRUG.” The past tense of drag is dragged. A television interviewer said two competing presi- dential candidates went to Dallas, Texas, and “drug along a bunch of advisers.” His “drug” use was dialectal. DRAMA, DRAMATIC, DRA- MATICALLY. 1. “Drama” every- where. 2. Alternatives. 1. “Drama” everywhere A drama is primarily a stage play, or a literary composition that tells a story through dialogue and action. Drama or the drama is (a) the art or profession dealing with plays, (b) the theater as an institution, or (c) plays collectively. By metaphoric extension, drama or a drama can mean either the nature of a play or a set of events like a play in action, con- flict, excitement, or story progression. Dramatic (adjective) means pertaining to drama (noun) or having its character- istics. Dramatically (adverb) means in a dramatic way or from the standpoint of drama. For example, conflict between characters is a dramatic device; a court trial sometimes is more dramatic than a stage play; the show last night was thought-provoking but dramatically in- adequate; he orated and gesticulated dramatically, like an old-time Shake- spearean actor. “Dramatic” verbiage has proliferated of late. That it does not take a drama critic to find things “dramatic” will be amply illustrated below. First comes a set of extracts from a book by a leading judge. The country had changed dramati- cally indeed from the time during the Civil War. . . . The income of individ- ual farmers rose dramatically. . . . The stock-market crash . . . dramatically slowed down industrial expansion. . . . In the short run the effect of the change in membership on the Court’s decisions was immediate, dramatic, and predictable. . . . When I moved . . . I was delighted with the dramatic change in my view. . . . Fi- nally, both the commercial activity and the population of the United States continued to increase dramati- cally. [Emphasis is added.] Within eight days, television reported that a woman’s illness had “dramatically worsened,” that local test scores had “dramatically increased from last year,” that “a dramatic shift in wind direction” could imperil aircraft, that prosecutors 104 doubling of letters 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 104"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"in a murder case had “unveiled some dramatic photos,” that Miami had “cut crime against tourists dramatically,” and that people could “dramatically reduce their risk of heart attacks.” In an ensuing week, there came television reports that test scores in the nation’s schools had “improved dramatically,” that a reser- voir had “dropped dramatically,” that a woman with the AIDS virus who took the drug AZT could “dramatically re- duce the chances of her baby getting AIDS,” and that chicken was found to be “dramatically better than ham- burger” in leanness. 2. Alternatives In most contemporary uses of “dra- matic” or “dramatically,” one can either eliminate the word without detriment or substitute a more accurate description. Two lists that follow offer fifty replace- ments. You may think of more. Adjectives: big, considerable, danger- ous, drastic, encouraging, extreme, great, high, huge, large, marked, mighty, noteworthy, precipitous, public, radical, remarkable, serious, sharp, significant, stark, steep, striking, stunning, substan- tial, vast. Adverbs: considerably, dangerously, drastically, encouragingly, extremely, far, greatly, highly, hugely, markedly, might- ily, much, precipitously, publicly, radi- cally, remarkably, seriously, sharply, significantly, starkly, steeply, stunningly, substantially, vastly. Saying that something is dramatic or done dramatically does not make it so. If it is so, such a label may be superfluous. Sometimes the right choice of verb makes any allusion to “drama” unneces- sary. For instance, “the rate dramatically increased” is a cumbersome way of say- ing the rate soared. A more precise way is to use a number, if it is known: the rate doubled or increased 69 percent. These seven words made up a para- graph in a newspaper: “The child language field has dramatically mush- roomed.” Would the field be any worse off if it just mushroomed? DROVE. Drove is the past tense of drive (verb, transitive and intransitive). A drove (noun, from the same source, the Old English drifan, to drive) is a group of animals being driven as a herd or flock. Someone probably saw the re- semblance between the moving animals and a moving crowd of people, for at times drove is applied to the latter. Typi- cally the word applies to cattle or sheep. “Mice appear to be flocking out of the area in droves.” That was heard on a news-radio station. To flock is to gather or travel in a flock or crowd, so flocking would suffice to get across the idea of multiplicity without “in droves.” “DRUG” and DRAGGED. See DRAGGED and “DRUG.” DUAL and DUEL. See Homo- phones. DUE TO. When to use the phrase due to and when not to use it can be confus- ing, although the publisher who wrote the sentence below should have known better. This price increase has become nec- essary due to the new state sales tax on newspapers and the increasing costs associated with producting the IJ. All grammarians approve of due to when it means caused by or attributable to and is helped by a form of the verb to be: “His back injury was due to a fall from a cliff.” However, when due to means because of and follows a clause, it is considered taboo. “He suffered a back injury due to a fall from a cliff.” Among acceptable phrases in this type of sentence are as a due to 105 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 105"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"result of, because of, on account of, and owing to. The grammarians have never satisfac- torily explained this rule. (They say that due is an adjective and should modify a noun. In the taboo form of sentence, it introduces an adverbial phrase, which modifies the verb. But owing also is an adjective and owing to gets their ap- proval in the same type of sentence.) Careful writers and speakers generally accept the rule, whatever its rationality. As for the opening quotation: one should expect a publisher to be careful enough to avoid a “due to” snare (and delete an unneeded “t” from producing ) before he publishes a statement explain- ing why a paper is worth more money. DUM-DUM BULLET. A newspa- per quoted a public official who had re- turned from the Middle East: “I saw older men and women who had been beaten and had suffered from dumb-dumb bullets.” To avoid that dumb-dumb error, realize that the dum-dum bullet, an outlawed, soft-nosed bullet that expands on im- pact, originated in Dum Dum, India, a town near Calcutta. Another spelling of the place is Dumdum and of the bullet is dumdum, never “dumb-dumb.” 106 dum-dum bullet 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 106"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"EACH AND EVERY. See Twins, 1. EACH, EACH OF. Each can be ei- ther an adjective, meaning every (“We follow each clue”); or a pronoun, mean- ing every single one (“To each his own”). Either way, singularness is the essence of each. When the subject of a sentence is or starts with each, the subject is consid- ered singular. “Each has a car” or “Each person has a car.” Note that the verb (has) is singular too and so is the object (car). The same is true when the subject is each of followed by a plural noun or pronoun. Both of the sentences below are in error. The first was part of a televi- sion commentary; the second formed a large newspaper headline. Each of these ladies this evening are going to be doing such difficult rou- tines. Each of us should know and love our cholesterol level In the first, change “are” to is and “diffi- cult routines” to a difficult routine. In the second, just change “our” to his. An alternative is his or her, which may be impractical for a headline. There is another way: When the sub- ject of a sentence is plural and each fol- lows the subject immediately, merely modifying or explaining it, the verb and any following object are plural. “The boys each own cars.” / “We each should know our cholesterol levels.” (The arti- cle beneath the headline did not say to “love” them.) See also BETWEEN, 2; Nouns, 3; Pronouns, 2. EACH OTHER. Although each alone is singular, the phrase each other (a reciprocal pronoun) is considered plu- ral. The following sentence, from a large ad by a government, goes astray in that respect and has four other flaws. Recently, the British Government which has a similar law [concerning drugs], agreed with the Bahamian government for the reciprocal en- forcement of forfeiture orders in each others’ country. The last word should be plural: coun- tries. In addition, the apostrophe goes before the s in each other’s. ( See Punctu- ation, 1. ) “Reciprocal” is redundant; ei- ther it or the last four words should be deleted. A comma belongs before “which.” ( See THAT and WHICH. ) Fi- nally, the two governments deserve the same kind of G or g.

Some say to use each other for two, one another for three or more: “Agnes and John love each other.” / “The three friends visit one an- other’s homes.” H. W. Fowler saw nei- ther utility nor history on the side of such differentiation. Anyhow the use of each other for more than two is not com- mon. Using one another for two is more common. One another’s is the possessive form. EAGER. See ANXIOUS. EATEN and ATE. See Tense, 5A. ECLECTIC. Variety is the essence of this adjective. A descendant of the Greek eklegein, to select, eclectic means choos- ing or chosen from a variety of sources, subjects, methods, points of view, or the like. “He was an eclectic student, with broad interests.” / “The museum’s col- lection is eclectic.” Eclectic says nothing about merit or quality and does not mean discriminating, as some people seem to think. In a newsletter, the director of an in- stitute wrote about a series of educa- tional programs that “have featured a variety of eclectic programs. . . .” Either “a variety of” or “eclectic” should have been discarded. EFFECT. See AFFECT and EFFECT. EFFETE. Effete (adjective, pro- nounced like a FEAT ) is one of those useful words that have been devalued by misuse and rendered often ambiguous. Primarily it means no longer able to pro- duce offspring or fruit. It can also mean depleted of vitality, exhausted of vigor. An article about Thomas Jefferson says, “Theodore Roosevelt thought he was effete.” The adjoining sentences (telling of others’ views of Jefferson) shed no light on the writer’s meaning. Other sources suggest that incapable and visionary (Roosevelt’s own words) would have been more informative than “effete”; so would ineffective or timid. A review of a joint Russian and Amer- ican art exhibit says, “The American painting, on the contrary, looks effete. It’s so well-made that its life is gone.” This time the passage offers a clue. By “effete,” the writer appears to mean life- less in creation, not depleted of life but stillborn. At times decadent, effeminate, fop- pish, soft, weak, or even elite has been loosely replaced by effete. Spiro Agnew used it to describe the press corps. It is seldom clear exactly what the user has in mind. Effete came from the Latin effetus, that has produced young (from ex-, out, and fetus, giving birth—the source of the English fetus ).

As a conjunction Either fits four categories. In the sen- tences below, from two restaurant re- views, it is meant as a conjunction, or connecting word, but it is misused. Dessert is either vanilla ice cream, spumoni or a respectable caramel cus- tard for $ 1 . 50 more. . . . Other meals [include] . . . meat- sauced rice and country salads and ei- ther five-spice chicken, imperial rolls, or shish kebobs. . . . As a conjunction, either means one or the other of two possibilities. Each sam- ple sentence, however, tells of a choice 108 eager 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 108"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"between three. Omit “either” or else change it to a choice of. The either . . . or form connects two grammatically equal portions of a sen- tence. ( Either and or are called correla- tive conjunctions. Other such pairs are neither . . . nor and both . . . and. ) It is correct to say, “You may choose either soup or salad”—a noun follows the ei- ther and a noun follows the or. Sometimes the either is misplaced, like this: “You may either choose soup or salad.” Although you will understand her when a waitress says it, the sentence is not logical: a verb and its object follow the either while a noun follows the or. Either tends to grab the next word or phrase. “You may either choose”—here it makes sense—“or have the choice made for you.” This excerpt, from a book on art his- tory, is ill-balanced: Nowadays, Bosch is either consid- ered a surrealist, a painter of re- pressed desires and human solitude, or a fiery mystic with esoteric inclina- tions. . . . It says that the artist “is either con- sidered [verb] . . . or a fiery mystic [noun]. . . .” The sentence can easily be repaired by interchanging “either” and the verb, “considered”: Nowadays, Bosch is considered ei- ther a surrealist [noun] . . . or a fiery mystic [noun]. . . . An alternative solution is to insert a verb after or. Example: Nowadays, Bosch is either consid- ered [verb] a surrealist . . . or consid- ered [or called, verb] a fiery mystic. . . . The problem can be more subtle: “He is either fibbing or has forgotten.” He is is followed sensibly by fibbing (present participle) but not so by has forgotten (auxiliary verb and past participle). These are three alternative repairs: “He is either fibbing or forget- ting.” / “He either is fibbing or has for- gotten.” / “Either he is fibbing or he has forgotten.” When each noun is singular, any verb that follows has to be singular too: “Ei- ther a hurricane or an eruption comes every few years”—not “come.” When each noun is plural, any verb that fol- lows must be plural: “Either hurricanes or eruptions come every few years”— not “comes.” It becomes more complicated when the nouns differ in number. Make the verb plural if it is closer to the plural noun than to the singular noun: “Either Presley or the Jacksons are on that record.” If the verb is closer to the singu- lar noun, what then? Some grammarians would permit “Either the Jacksons or Presley is . . . ,” but a better procedure is to put the plural noun second, as in the previous example; or to revise the sen- tence, for example: “The Jacksons may be on that record, or it may be Presley.” See also NEITHER; OR. 2. Other functions Either serves as three other parts of speech: adjective (“Either entree is satis- factory”); pronoun (“Either is satisfac- tory”); and adverb, which follows a negative statement (“If you don’t want to eat, I won’t either”). Either, as an ad- jective, sometimes means each, one and the other (“She wears a bracelet on ei- ther arm”). As an adjective or pronoun, either goes with a singular verb, singular noun, or singular possessive, as the case may be: “Either of them is capable of playing the role” —not “are capable.” / “No more copies were available at either the downtown or the uptown store” —not “stores.” / “Either woman will do her best” —not “their best.” either 109 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 109"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"3. Pronunciation H. W. Fowler wrote that EYE, “though not more correct,” was replac- ing EE as the pronunciation of the first syllable of either in England’s educated speech. EYE-thur seems to be making progress in America too. Imitation of the British practice or a belief that it is more high-class than EE-thur may help to ac- count for this development. EKE. In The Outline of History H. G. Wells describes the raising of livestock by Neolithic people and credits them with the discovery of milking. Then he correctly writes, “They eked out this food supply by hunting.” To eke out something is to supplement it, to add to it what it lacks. That which is eked out is the original thing (the food supply), not what is added and not what results. That is the primary meaning of the verb (tran- sitive). A later but now common meaning, disapproved by some critics, is to earn with difficulty. Land pressures are in- tense in El Salvador, a newspaper says, “because so many people are trying to eke a living out of so small a country.” In this sense, that which is eked out is what results (a living). Which sense is intended may not al- ways be clear. In the following sentence, what is the person’s occupation? “John eked out his living by selling clothing.” We do not know. If we construe the sen- tence according to the more traditional sense, John’s selling merely supplements his income. According to the later sense, sales are John’s livelihood. Eke alone, now archaic, meant to in- crease or enlarge (something); another meaning was also. An Old English ver- sion was spelled ecan, ycan, etc. So tradi- tionally eke or eke out is associated with the idea of adding. Contemporary users sometimes have in mind the opposite sense: subtracting, or squeezing out. These are from a newspaper and a book on law respectively: Once a company reneges on its half of the bargain, it will have trouble ek- ing out those sacrifices from its work- ers. Every grant to the President . . . was in effect a derogation from Congres- sional power, eked out slowly, reluc- tantly. . . . Still another sense of eke out, found in contemporary dictionaries if not often in use, is to make (a supply) last through economy. ELECT, ELECTED, ELECTIVE, ELECTORAL. 1. ELECTED and ELECTIVE. 2. ELECTORAL. 1. ELECTED and ELECTIVE To elect (verb, transitive or intransi- tive) is to choose. Politically, it is to choose an official by vote. A person so chosen is elected (past participle). The office so filled is elective (adjective); that is, filled by election. A telecast had an er- ror: He told ABC that he is not a candi- date for any elected office. “. . . Any elective office,” not “elected.” ( See also Tense, 2. ) The words can be used in nonpolitical contexts. “He elects to throw a curve ball.” / “I elected a science course.” / “It’s an elective course.” Elective here means optional, not required. Elect (adjective), in combination with the name of an office, e.g., president - elect, denotes one who has been elected but whose term has not yet begun. It can mean given preference: an elect group. In theology it means divinely picked for sal- vation. Those so picked are the elect (noun). 110 eke 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 110"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"2. ELECTORAL Elective can be a synonym for elec- toral (adjective), pertaining to selection by vote or having the authority to elect. The latter is pronounced i-LEK-tur-ul, not (as mispronounced by the host of a TV quiz show) “i-lek-TAUR-ul.” The Electoral College is not an educational institution but the body that formally elects the U.S. president. Its members are electors. A State Department spokesman ex- pressed hope that the Nicaraguan leader was not “trying to derail the electorial process.” The word is electoral. There is no “electorial.” ELEMENT. See SILICON and SILI- CONE. ELEMENTAL and ELEMEN- TARY. See Confusing pairs. ELLIPSE. See OVAL. Ellipsis. There are two kinds of ellip- sis. In grammar it is the omission of a word or words that would make a sen- tence more complete but that can be un- derstood from the context. In punctuation it is the set of dots used when part of a quotation is omitted. Only the first kind concerns us right now. ( See also Punctuation, 5. ) One need not, and should not, repeat the is in this sentence: “The boy is 5 , the girl 4 .” The single verb suffices for both nouns. “I’ll be ready when you are.” That sentence could end with another ready, but it is not necessary. Sometimes a writer or speaker leaves out too much, perhaps a necessary word. As a result, the sentence sounds awk- ward or even leaves us guessing. A news story in a prominent daily said: The Senate’s current version calls for spending $ 2 . 6 billion for drug en- forcement that the House does not. “Does not” what? Want? Match? Agree with? “Does not” relates to nothing that was said or that is obvious. Whatever the meaning is, the sentence would be far clearer if it were divided into two sen- tences. End the first with “. . . drug en- forcement.” Begin the second like this: “The House’s version provides . . .” or “does not provide. . . .” A passage in a book on law and gov- ernment is even more puzzling: Having survived the legal maze, where have we ended up regarding the 1973 bombing of Cambodia? Still in something of a mess, because every time Congress authorized the bomb- ing a number of its members said that they weren’t. “Weren’t” what? “Weren’t aware that it had ” would be an adequate ellipsis—if that was the intended meaning. Or per- haps the author meant hadn’t and wrote “weren’t” by mistake. (Neither contrac- tion suits the grave topic. See Contrac- tions, 2. ) In an ellipsis, it is enough work for the reader or listener to silently repeat a word or phrase without having to change its form. Any word or phrase to be supplied should be exactly the same as one that has just been used. This is from the daily quoted above: The companies include . . . the United Coconut Planters Bank, whose dispo- sition could determine the shape of the coconut industry, one of the coun- tries largest. “Largest” does not connect with any other word in the sentence. If the co- conut industry is “one of the country’s largest industries, ” why not say so? (A careless transformation of country’s also mars the sentence.

A newspa- per article said that courts had upheld a Minnesota law under which a man was charged with “fetal homicide” as well as murder. Allegedly he had shot a preg- nant woman, killing both her and her one-month-old “fetus.” A woman who is one month pregnant carries an embryo, not a “fetus.” An em- bryo is an incipient animal or human be- ing. It is in the early stages of development, unlike a fetus, which is in the middle or late stages. Interpretations differ somewhat. For the human species, some draw the line at two months, oth- ers at three months. Embryo comes from the Greek em- bryon, embryo, fetus, or that which is newly born. Fetus traces to Latin, in which it means fetus, progeny, preg- nancy, or a giving birth. EMERITUS. Emeritus (adjective) means being retired from service but keeping the title one held. As part of a ti- tle, it commonly follows the original ti- tle: “Professor Emeritus John J. Doe.” Otherwise it can follow or precede the original title: “He is an emeritus profes- sor of law.” It is mainly applied to those retired from colleges and universities, oc- casionally to others retired from white- collar positions. In ancient Rome emeritus (past par- ticiple of emereri, to earn by service) re- ferred to a man who had served his term as a soldier. The term is never applied to a former or retired member of the U.S. armed forces. To use emeritus indiscriminately in describing a former job can be ludicrous. The lead sentence of a newspaper’s main article applied it to a professional politi- cian who had not retired but had been unseated from his last office by a term limitation. Assembly Speaker Emeritus Willie Brown continues to hold a slim lead over Mayor Frank Jordan among vot- ers as next month’s mayoral election nears. . . . An emeritus (noun) is one who is emeritus (adjective). The plural is emer- iti. Pronunciations: em-MER-it-us and em-MER-it-tie. One who uses Latinisms strictly will speak of a woman as emerita (adjective) or an emerita (noun). The plural is emer- itae.

A book by a prominent judge describes changes in U.S. population, such as an increase of sixty million in fifty years. Some of this was natural increase, but a good deal of it resulted from emigra- tion. In the forty years between 1860 and 1900 , 14 million people had emi- grated to the United States from for- eign countries. . . . At the same time that emigrants and other settlers were populating the territories in the West, many other emigrants were settling in the large cities of the East and Mid- west. [Emphasis is added.] Change “emigration” to immigration, “emigrated” to immigrated, and “emi- grants” to immigrants. Which family of words to call on de- pends on whether you emphasize mi- grating in, or migrating out. The author emphasizes migrating in. Immigrate originates in the Latin in-, in, and mi- grare, to migrate; emigrate in the Latin ex-, out, and migrare. A form of in- is im- while a form of ex- is e-. That ety- mology explains the double m in the im- migrate words, the single m in the emigrate words. If you need a memory aid, think of import, to bring goods into a country; and export, to send goods out of a coun- try. To immigrate (verb, intransitive) is to enter and settle in a country. Often it is followed by to and the name of the new country. “The Treskunoffs immigrated to the United States ten years ago.” The act or practice of immigrating is immi- gration (noun). One who immigrates is an immigrant (noun). To emigrate (verb, intransitive) is to leave one’s home country with the inten- tion of giving up residence there. Often it is followed by from and the name of the old country. “The Treskunoffs emigrated from Russia ten years ago.” The act or practice of emigrating is emigration (noun). One who emigrates is an emi- grant (noun). Occasionally immigrate and emigrate are used (as transitive verbs) to mean bring in as immigrants or to send out as emigrants. “The company immigrated Chinese to work cheaply as laborers.” EMINENT and IMMINENT. 1. The difference. 2. Related terms. 1. The difference Once, while working as a news re- porter, I looked in on the mayor’s office, where efforts were being made to negoti- ate the end of a labor dispute. As I was telephoning my editor from the ante- room, the mayor walked in and told me, “The settlement of the bus strike is emi- nent.” I said, misquoting him, “The mayor says the settlement of the bus strike is imminent.” (We had a scoop.) The mayor knew his business, but what he did not know is that eminent (adjective) means prominent, outstand- ing, or noteworthy, whereas imminent (adjective) means impending or soon to occur; sometimes, threatening: said of a danger or misfortune. Some writers do not know that either. A weekly’s review of a Shakespearean play contained this sentence: “Best of all, the language, while still Bard-ese, is im- minently comprehensible.” In this case, “imminently” should be eminently (ad- verb), meaning to a remarkable degree or in an outstanding way. Note that eminent ( ly ) has one m while imminent ( ly ) has two m ’s. The words originate in Latin, in ex-, out, and in-, in, respectively ( e- and im- are forms of them) plus minere, to project. 2.

Pre- ceded by his or your, it is a title of honor for a cardinal in the Roman Catholic Church. Imminence (noun) is the condition of being imminent; or something that is im- minent, particularly impending danger or evil. A superficially similar word, not so common, is immanent (adjective). Stem- ming from the Latin in, not, and manere, to remain, it means existing or remain- ing within, particularly within one’s mind. In theology, it pertains to the doc- trine of immanence (noun), under which God dwells everywhere in the universe. EMPLOY. See UTILIZE, UTILIZA- TION (end). ENDED and ENDING. The Times Poll . . . interviewed 1 , 618 American adults by telephone for three days ending Sunday night. Such use is common. But some authori- ties prefer ended, rather than “ending,” when the period is over. (It is completely ended, not just in the process of ending. ) Some others accept either word. (Present participles sometimes apply to past events.) All agree that ending is the word to use when the terminal date is in the fu- ture. ENDEMIC. “The problem is the kind of violence that’s now becoming en- demic to Mexico,” a panelist on a televi- sion forum said. He spoke in the wake of a revolt and a political assassination in Mexico. That which is endemic to a place is re- stricted to it or particularly prevalent there. The kangaroo is endemic to Aus- tralia, the apteryx to New Zealand. Po- litical violence, alas, is a global phenomenon. Thus the panelist’s state- ment was not accurate, particularly if the violence was just “now becoming” com- mon in Mexico. The main article in a newspaper de- scribed economic shortcomings in Shanghai, adding: Meanwhile, tax evasion in the Shanghai private sector became en- demic, increasing an income gap between state employees and free- market entrepreneurs that has aggra- vated social tensions. If the writer wanted to say that tax eva- sion had become a phenomenon peculiar to Shanghai (a dubious proposition), en- demic would be appropriate. But if he sought to bring out the rapid and exten- sive spread of tax evasion there, the word to use would be epidemic. ENDING. See ENDED and END- ING. “END OF AN ERA.” See ERA, 2. ENDS JUSTIFY THE MEANS. Having gone to Somalia, Africa, to feed the people, U.S. and allied forces were shooting some of them instead. A TV news correspondent said the question was “whether these drastic means justify the humanitarian end.” He had it backward. The question was “whether the humanitarian end jus- tifies these drastic means.” Normally the means do not justify the end; that is a matter of language. The end may or may not justify the means; that is a matter of opinion. ENERGIZE and ENERVATE. See Confusing pairs. ENORMITY.

Either they are used to being close to nature, he said, or “the enormity of what’s happened to them hasn’t yet sunk in.” Unless he was saying that the hurri- cane was outrageously immoral, he mis- understood the meaning of enormity. He may have confused it with enormous- ness, although magnitude or gravity might have been a better choice of nouns. Enormity denotes monstrous evil or a monstrously evil act. A nonhuman phenomenon like a hurricane is amoral, unless one ascribes it to the devil or an evil spirit. Flying from England to Cameroun, an author observed the Sahara below. “Hours later, still above the desert, we began to appreciate its enormity.” Al- though some travelers in the desert have found it to be a hell, vastness or immen- sity would fit the context better. On a TV show about famous athletes, a narrator said of a baseball player, “Now, two decades later, the enormity of his accomplishments can be appreci- ated.” Surely the TV man did not intend to associate Hank Aaron’s accomplish- ments with monstrous evil, yet that is lit- erally what he did by using “enormity” when he could have used greatness. A book (of mine) said, “. . . The enor- mity of the cocktails took them out of the ‘social’ category.” Although some have described alcohol as a wicked de- mon, in this instance the word should have been immensity or hugeness. Some dictionaries offer such words among the definitions of enormity with- out mentioning that many critics scorn its application to mere size. A source of criticism is American Heritage Dictio- nary; 93 percent of its usage panel re- jected “The enormity of Latin America is readily apparent from these maps.” At one time enormous meant mon- strously wicked. It and enormity both trace to the Latin enormis, meaning out of the ordinary, huge. -EN, -REN plurals. See Plurals and singulars, 1, 2D. ENSURE and INSURE. See AS- SURE, ENSURE, and INSURE. ENTHUSE, ENTHUSED. If the colloquial “enthused” ever is acceptable, it is assuredly out of place in a grim arti- cle about “the fratricidal carnage” of revolutionary France: Baron Armel de Wismes, who puts on a black tie of mourning on the an- niversary of Louis XVI’s execution, is not enthused about the festivities marking the 200 th anniversary of the French Revolution. The appropriate adjective is enthusiastic, meaning ardently interested in some- thing. At times “enthuse” is used as a verb. Most dictionaries call “enthuse(d)” colloquial, informal, or popular, and few writers, speakers, or educators show en- thusiasm (noun) for it. “The majority leader enthused over his party’s gains,” instead of became or waxed enthusiastic, was disapproved by 76 percent of The American Heritage Dictionary ’s usage panel. “He was con- siderably less enthused by signs of fac- tionalism,” instead of enthusiastic over, was disapproved by 72 percent. The panel did not consider the verb in a tran- sitive sense, for which a case could be made: “Professor Marshall enthused his students,” instead of roused enthusiasm in or made . . . enthusiastic.

Definition; pronunciation An era is a division of time that is (a) reckoned from a notable historical event, as the Christian era is; (b) distinctive in its character, events, conditions, or lead- ers, like the Roman “era of the adven- turer generals” (H. G. Wells) or the nineteenth-century American “era of good feeling”; or (c) fundamental in geo- logic history, like the Mesozoic era. Its customary pronunciation has long been EAR-uh. Many now pronounce it like error without the final r, possibly risking misunderstanding. Modern dic- tionaries give both pronunciations. 2. When will it end? The news media, with a notable sense of history, inform us of all the various eras that we pass through—but only when the eras end; they are perpetually ending. These were press headlines: “Era in Houston Ends As Chronicle Is Sold” / “Christmas at B. Altman: the End of an Era . . .” / “An era ends: Johnny [Car- son] says goodbye.” Broadcasters reported “the end of an era” when a navy yard was shut down, a military base was closed, a gorilla died at a zoo, a hotel was demolished, and an- other navy yard closed. A news service applied the same phrase to a bookstore’s closing. When the baseball player Jose Can- seco was traded, an era did not end; it merely relocated. A main story in a Cali- fornia daily began, “A’s general manager Sandy Alderson sent an era to Texas.” EROTIC. See EXOTIC. ERR, ERROR. Opening a segment on movie mistakes, a network television program displayed the title “TO ER- ROR IS HUMAN” on the screen. The network staff itself was in error, mis- quoting the ancient, proverbial saying “To err is human.” Error is a noun only. It means, of course, mistake. It can also mean wrong- doing, an act or example of deviation from what is right, or any of various de- fensive misplays in baseball. The related verb is to err, which can mean to make a mistake, to do some- thing wrong, or to go off course. (“The captain chose to err on the side of cau- tion.” / “I’m afraid that I have erred in my calculation.”) Err rhymes with her and sir. “To err is human” goes back at least to the Roman philosopher and dramatist Seneca ( 4 ? B . C .– A . D . 65 ). Many others repeated that thought in one form or an- other, in numerous languages. The ver- sion by Alexander Pope, the English poet ( 1688 – 1744 ), “To err is human, to for- give divine,” is particularly famous. ERRANT and ARRANT. See Con- fusing pairs. ERSTWHILE. Erstwhile (adjective) means former. It is a literary word, not a word to be used regularly in conversa- tion or frequently in writing. When it does surface in casual talk or informal writing, its users often seem unsure of what it means. In a discussion on television, a pan- elist wondered whether the vice presi- dent’s involvement in a controversy over election-campaign financing would af- fect his presidential ambition. She asked: Does this hurt him? Does this make his erstwhile opponents lick their chops? She was literally asking about his former opponents. “Erstwhile” should have been would-be.

See Crimes, 5. ESTIMATE, ESTIMATED. 1. An estimated what? 2. Estimated by whom? 3. Pronunciation; other forms. 1. An estimated what? “An estimated” followed by a num- ber and a plural noun is a well-worn pat- tern in the popular press, although four specimens in one news story is unusual. The story dealt with reactions to China’s Tiananmen Square massacre. On Sunday . . . an estimated 3 , 000 students and sympathizers rallied at Miyashita Park in Tokyo’s Shibuya district. . . . An estimated 2 , 000 Chinese stu- dents held similar demonstrations Sunday and yesterday outside Chinese consulates in Osaka, Fukuda and Nagoya. . . . Major travel agencies reported that an estimated 500 Japanese are touring in China. . . . There are an estimated 3 , 100 Japa- nese residents . . . in Beijing. Nonjournalists are less likely to say “an estimated 5 , 000 were there” than “ about [or around or approximately or roughly ] 5 , 000 were there.” No one would say or write, for in- stance, “an 8 , 000 marchers.” The “esti- mated” is supposed to make it right. It has been said that “total of” is under- stood. The New York Times chose to in- sert the two words, properly, in an article about Yugoslavia in the 1940 s. An estimated total of 1 , 700 , 000 Yu- goslavs were killed, both in combat and in atrocities and reprisals by and against civilians. The Far Eastern article could have said, for instance, “An estimated total of 2 , 000 Chinese students. . . .” The same thought can be expressed in some other way: A group estimated at 2 , 000 ; or a crowd estimated (or said or believed ) to number 2 , 000 ; or simply about or ap- proximately or roughly 2 , 000 . Around is colloquial. 2. Estimated by whom? When “estimated” is used in a vague sense, one is entitled to ask: “estimated” by whom? It does not tell us much unless we know who has done the estimating. If, for instance, the police make an esti- mate of the size of the crowd attending a rally, it may differ wildly from an esti- mate made by the sponsors or by jour- nalists. It is best to state clearly, “The police estimated that 5 , 000 attended” or “The sponsors estimated that 15 , 000 at- tended.” If the word estimate or estimated is used, a true estimate— that is, an ap- proximate calculation—ought to have been made. Sometimes the figure is just a guess, but one never reads in the news- paper or hears on the air, “A guessed 10 , 000 supporters attended.” 3. Pronunciation; other forms As a noun, meaning an approximate calculation, estimate is pronounced ES- tim-mit. As a verb, meaning to calculate something approximately, estimate is pronounced ES-tim-mate. Estimated, the past tense and past estimate, estimated 117 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 117"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"participle of the verb estimate, is com- monly used as an adjective in the press. The adjective presented in dictionaries is estimative: pertaining to estimating or serving as an estimate. (“The 3 , 000 is only estimative.”) Estimation can be an act of estimat- ing; a judgment made as a result; a valu- ation of merit; or esteem, repute. A few critics object to the phrase “in my esti- mation.” Roy H. Copperud writes, “ Es- timate is the judgment, estimation the process of forming it.” Raising no such objection, The American Heritage Dic- tionary illustrates estimation by quoting Thoreau: “No man ever stood the lower in my estimation for having a patch in his clothes.” ET AL. See ETC., ET CETERA, 2. ETC., ET CETERA. 1. And the rest. 2. ET AL. 1. And the rest In Latin et means and and cetera means the rest. As adapted to English, the phrase et cetera is the equivalent of and so on or and so forth. Often it is ab- breviated: etc. Its user avoids listing all the items in a category. “They hunt small animals: rabbits, squirrels, etc.” The etc. indicates others in the same category (like gophers and chipmunks, in this in- stance). Sometimes the two words are com- bined in the noun etcetera ( s ). “The sen- tence ends with a lazy etcetera.” / “I packed the main items and let the etceteras go.” Inasmuch as and is what the et means, “and” or “&” should not precede et cetera or etc., although &c. is an op- tional abbreviation. A broadcaster spoke of “alcohol, tobacco, and et cetera” and, in another redundancy the next day, ended a series “et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.” A variant spelling is et caetera. How- ever it is spelled, it is pronounced either et-SET-uh-ruh or et-SET-ruh. Occasion- ally someone mispronounces the et “ex” or misspells etc.: A printed sign in a store window said, in advertising animals made from plant parts, “Everything is Natural . . . Eyes, Nose, Tail, Ect.” Usage critics have taken aim at etc. One called it amateurish and slovenly in literary prose. To another, etc. suits com- mercial or technical writing but its use elsewhere can make a writer seem lazy or ignorant. While accepting those pronounce- ments as caveats, we can temper them: etc. can either stunt or tighten a sen- tence; it is a matter of judgment. If etc. seems too curt, alternatives are to spell out et cetera or follow the series with and so on or another indication that the examples given are not exhaustive. Yet if conciseness is desired, particularly when the listing is parenthetical or tabular, etc. may be preferable, as long as it is clear what etc. is meant to suggest. When, in highly concise fashion, only one item precedes the etc., a comma need not intervene: instead of “rabbits, etc.,” make it rabbits etc. 2. ET AL. A phrase of similar meaning, used of- ten in legal writing, is et al. It is an abbre- viation of the Latin et alii, meaning and others, or et alius, meaning and another. For instance, a case may be titled John Smith v. Harry Robinson et al., indicat- ing that there are other defendants be- sides Robinson. ETERNITY. It is forever. It is time without end. (To state the definition of this noun is not to take any stand on the implicit cosmological question.) Some- times eternity is used metaphorically to describe an extremely long time.

FOREVER, FOR EVER. 4. HOW- EVER. 5. WHYEVER, WHY EVER. 6. With RARELY, SELDOM; definitions. 1. Apart or together?—the W-words Two words or one word? That is the question here, whether to write what ever, when ever, where ever, and who ever or whatever, whenever, wherever, and whoever. The answer is brief: one word in a statement, two words in a question. A book departs from that rule: What ever method you use, however, should be checked out with the local postal officials in your area. “ Whatever method you use” would be right. The excerpt is a declarative sen- tence, a statement. All the four w- words should be treated the same. “We visit them when- ever we can.” / “He goes wherever they send him.” / “Whoever did that must have been mad.” In sentences like these, however, the w- root and the ever part company: “What ever made him do such a thing?” / “When ever will that check come?” / “Where ever did you hear that?” / “Who ever said such nonsense?” In an interrogative sentence, that is, a question, ever intensifies the basic word but is not essential to it. The separate ever is roughly equivalent to conceivably, possibly, on earth, the heck, and in the world. For example, “What ever made him . . . ?” and “Who ever said . . . ?” mean almost the same as “What con- ceivably made him . . . ?” and “Who on earth said . . . ?” The w- word and the ever need not be next to each other: “ Where was it ever written that I have to support your brother?” is similar to “Where the heck was it written . . . ?” The rule was essentially enunciated by H. W. Fowler, although he restricted the interrogative ever to sentences reproduc- ing highly informal spoken speech. (Even then, who could not come next to ever; he wanted “ Who could ever . . . ? ” instead of “ Who ever could . . . ?” To his reviser, Sir Ernest Gowers, the former was merely “better.”) Wilson Follett sanctioned the sepa- rated, interrogative ever for any “com- mon use” but not for a “grave style.” He wrote that the adverbs “whatever, who- ever, whenever, wherever, however, and whyever are rhetorically equivalent and should be treated alike.” Follett’s ap- proach is recommended. (He noted that dictionaries separated some words, kept some joined, and disagreed on which words to give each treatment. Their un- ruliness persists.) Speakers need not worry about a dif- ference between the two forms, although they do tend to give an interrogative ever more emphasis than a declarative -ever. 2. EVER and EVERY Ever so is a colloquial phrase meaning very, to an extreme degree or extent: “The sea is ever so calm today.” Ever so often means very often or repeatedly: “It’s been raining ever so often lately.” Ever so often should not be confused with every so often, which means now and then or once in a while: “Every so often someone hits the jackpot.” Some- times the “ever” phase is used mistak- enly when the every phrase is meant. 3. FOREVER, FOR EVER Forever is infrequently written as two (-)ever 119 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 119"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"words, for ever, an older style. Either way, it means eternally or continually. See FOREVER. 4. HOWEVER However requires special caution, un- like the two-word form, how ever, whose use in questions is clear: “How ever did you accomplish it?” The one-word form, however, used in declarative sentences, bears a dual mean- ing. It can mean (as an adverb) no matter how or by whatever means: “However you travel, make sure to arrive on time.” It can also mean (as a conjunction) but or in spite of that: “I didn’t get the job, however they said they would keep me in mind.” However can be ambiguous, as in this sentence: “I want to sail how- ever the winds rage.” Is the speaker fear- less or fearful? 5. WHYEVER, WHY EVER Whyever is rather rare. Why ever is more common. “He must be punished whyever he did it.” But “Why ever did he do it?” 6. With RARELY, SELDOM; definitions Ever means, among other definitions, at any time. “Does he ever do any work?” Popularly used in this way: “He seldom [or “rarely”] ever does any work,” it is considered redundant by The American Heritage Dictionary and its usage panel and by Roy C. Copperud, although the expression has been around since the mid-eighteenth century. One may use seldom if ever or seldom or never (substituting rarely as needed) or just leave out the “ever.” Presumably the critics are concerned that time is built into the words rarely and seldom. Not so hardly; it is perfectly all right to say, or sing, “He’s hardly ever sick at sea!” Ever can also mean always (“We must be ever vigilant”), by any chance (“If there ever was damage, you would be protected”), or repeatedly (“The neigh- bors are ever throwing parties”). Collo- quially it is also an intensive, comparable to very: “Was that dinner ever good!” EVERY.

Similarly, no- body and no one have the same mean- ing: no person. So do somebody and someone: some person. All are pro- nouns. (A somebody is a colloquial noun meaning an important person.) In each pair, one word is not necessar- ily better than the other, and the choice is a matter of personal preference. Sometimes, when rhythm or concise- ness is important, the fact that one word of the pair has an additional syllable and an additional letter can make a differ- ence. Everybody has four syllables and nine letters, everyone three and eight. The second e is silent. Everyone should not be confused with every one. See EVERY ONE and EV- ERYONE. 2. “EVERYONE’S TALKING ABOUT” The expression “everyone [or “every- body”] is talking about” with a mention of a new establishment, product, publi- cation, service, show, or other thing is a promotional device aimed at making us jump on the bandwagon. If everyone were really talking about something, it would be unnecessary to advertise it. But the expression is rarely true.

Exaggeration Everybody and everyone are often gross overstatements. The question in what group? ought to be answered, at least implicitly, unless the pronoun rep- resents every person there is. An article in the sports section of a na- tional newspaper opened this way: One word sums up the NFL draft: need. Everybody talked about it, ev- erybody thought about it, everybody drafted based on it. There may have been a few people in the world who did not talk, think, or do anything about the need for football players. See also Run-on sentence, 2. “Everybody does it,” or words to the same effect, is a common rationalization for a questionable action. An entertainer said, concerning a risqué photograph of him and a woman on a record cover: “When girls see it they go, ‘Oh, that’s nasty.’ But everybody does the same stuff behind closed doors.” Speak for yourself, please. 4. Number Both everybody and everyone are sin- gular. Any pertinent noun, possessive, or verb must be singular. “Has everyone here received a pam- phlet? ” / “ Everybody pulled his weight.” / “ Everyone in these units is well pre- pared.” See also PRONOUNS, 2. EVERY DAY and EVERYDAY. Just because the words every and day come close to each other is no cause to unite them. These three quotations have the same error. [By a news agency:] “Everyday he’s feeling better.” [By a columnist:] “Editorials like that aren’t written every- day.” [On the TV screen:] “Kids ride free everyday.” Every day must be kept separate when each day can be substituted. Corrections: “ Every day he’s feeling better.” / “Edito- rials like that aren’t written every day. ” / “Kids ride free every day. ” In such in- stances, when the pair serves as an ad- verb, there is no more reason to unite the two words than to unite every hour or every week. However, the unitary form, everyday, is correct as an adjective, e.g., “Her everyday activities are vigorous.” Two companies made the opposite slip. In a magazine ad, a chain of computer stores promised “EVERY DAY LOW PRICES!” Signs in the windows of a thrift and loan company urged the pub- lic to “LOOK AT OUR EVERY DAY HIGH YIELDS!” In both sentences “EVERYDAY” would have been right. In pronouncing every day, we empha- size both ev- and day. In pronouncing ev- eryday, we emphasize just ev-. EVERY ONE and EVERYONE. Just as every day should not always be unified, neither should every one, al- though the rules are different. The first example is from a weekly publication. “Everyone of our 1 , 500 personnel should have a flashlight—with extra batteries and extra lights.” In quoting an oral statement, the writer mistakenly united every one. ( See also PERSONNEL. ) A form letter to clients from a securi- ties group contained the same type of er- ror. every one and everyone 121 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 121"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"With the holiday season upon us, we . . . would like to extend our warmest greetings of friendship and thanks to each and everyone of our clients. . . . Only when everybody can be substi- tuted is everyone right. It means each person. It never applies to things or ani- mals, and it can never be followed by of. “Everyone needs a home.” / “Everyone must eat” / “Everyone in our house has voted.” In speech, the first syllable is em- phasized: EV-re-won. Every one places more importance on the one. It means every single member of a particular group, which can comprise people, things, or animals. Often of fol- lows, as in “every one of our 1 , 500 ” and “each and every one of our clients.” The of and its object may be absent but im- plied: “Twenty mice were tested and ev- ery one proved to be disease-free.” When every one is spoken, both the ev- and the one are emphasized. Both every one and everyone are sin- gular and any ensuing verb or pronoun must be singular: “ Every one of the con- testants gives her all.” / “ Everyone looks out for himself. ” See also EVERYBODY, EVERYONE; NOT, 1A; Pronouns, 2C. “EVERYTHING FROM.” See Range, true and false, 4. EVIDENCE and PROOF. Although loosely used as synonyms, they are not the same. Evidence is not necessarily proof, but it takes evidence to establish proof. In general, the first is tentative; the second is conclusive. Evidence means data that help to es- tablish a factual conclusion or that are meant to lead to a judgment. In a legal case, testimony of witnesses, documents, and objects typically serve as evidence that opposing sides present in efforts to demonstrate opposite contentions. Proof means evidence that is sufficient to prove something, i.e., to establish a fact or to show the truth of a proposi- tion. In a legal case, proof means evi- dence that convinces those standing in judgment that a contention is true. When a chimpanzee was found to have the human immunodeficiency virus, a telecaster introduced the news this way: “There’s proof today that AIDS came from chimps.” It was prema- ture to describe a preliminary piece of evidence as “proof.” Better news reports said the disease “most likely came” or “may have come” from simians. EVIDENT, EVIDENTLY. See AP- PARENT, APPARENTLY. EVOKE and INVOKE. An art gallery says a certain artist’s paintings “invoke a sense of continuum. . . .” They evoke it. ( Verbosity has further quota- tion.) To evoke is to elicit, bring forth, or produce (typically a response, feeling, or image). According to a news story, a litigant “evoked” an obscure law. He invoked it. To invoke is to appeal to a deity or higher power for help, to call upon a source of authority, or to conjure (a spirit) by incantation. EXACERBATE and EXASPER- ATE. A hill was crumbling, threaten- ing a house on top. When a television reporter spoke of the events that had “exasperated the problem,” was she cor- rect or should she have used exacerbated instead? At least five dictionaries vindicate her, approving of the interchangeable use of exacerbate and exasperate (verbs, transi- tive). In common usage, though, the words are restricted in this way: Exacerbate: to make (an illness or other unsatisfactory condition) more in- tense. Exasperate: to make (someone) angry or highly annoyed.

EXCEPT and EXCEPTING. Ex- cepting in place of except is out of style. The -ing serves no function in this press excerpt: A number of small parties have emerged . . . but none of them, except- ing Civic Forum, appears to have the strength or organizational muscle to challenge the . . . Communist Party. As normally used (as a preposition) excepting follows a negative: “All politi- cal groups in the city, not excepting [not excluding] the Klan, have been invited.” In that context “not except” would be erroneous. When except (used as a preposition) is followed by a personal pronoun, the pronoun takes the objective case: “All the members voted for it except [other than] him and me, ” not “he and I.” See Pronouns, 10. Except can have other nuances. (As a conjunction:) “I would stay except that [if not for the fact that] my time is short.” / “He never goes out of town ex- cept [for any other purpose but] to gam- ble.” (As a verb:) “The costs of living are not high if you except [exclude] real es- tate and rent.” When spoken, the verb except ( s ) can be confused with “accept,” and except- ing with “accepting.” See Homophones. “EXCEPTION PROVES THE RULE.” As it is commonly used, this cliché contradicts scientific logic. Yet those invoking it assume that it bolsters their points of view: A book presents a rule that job pro- motion “is determined by pull” and a section headed “An Exception That Proves the Rule.” A TV commentator stated a rule that caucus winners lose elections and added, “Jimmy Carter, the exception that proves the rule, won Iowa in 1976 .” A movie reviewer wrote, “Italy is simply not a warlike nation. . . . Mussolini was the exception that proved the rule.” In another book, a conductor says making concert suites out of movie scores never works and “Prokofiev’s Nevsky or Walton’s Henry V . . . are the exceptions proving the rule.” How can an exception “prove” a rule? Shouldn’t the exception dis prove it? The answer lies in an archaic meaning of prove: to test, originating in the Latin probare, same meaning. It survives in some special fields, including mathemat- ics, minerals, and weapons. A scientist may test a rule (or theory, principle, etc.) by seeking an exception; finding one is reason to discard, or at least modify, the rule. Users of the cliché, unaware of its true meaning, cite it as authority to keep the rule despite the exception. Some rules, in grammar and spelling for instance, are not strict and have ex- ceptions. But those exceptions devaluate the rules rather than validate them. Exclamation point. See Punctuation, 6. EXECUTE. To execute someone is to impose capital punishment on him, to put him to death in accordance with a sentence legally imposed by a court of law. When criminals, terrorists, or other lawbreakers kill, it is homicide, if not murder, never “execution.” So it is when political leaders, government officials, or police kill outside of the judicial system, or when the military kills outside of a battle in war. See also Crimes, 4. After Peruvian soldiers had stormed an embassy to rescue hostages, a news story reported accusations that military commandos had executed some of the guerrillas who had tried to surrender. . . .

Speculation that some rebels were executed . . . have been increasing. [Emphasis is added.] Execute ( d ) is at best a euphemism in such a context, and it can suggest a de- gree of legal justification that may not exist. In the sample, it could well have been replaced by kill ( ed ) or slay or slain, with the qualification that the victims were captured rebels. Another meaning of execute, an ear- lier meaning, is to carry out or put into effect (a law, a plan, an order, etc.). See also SLAY, SLAIN, SLEW. EXERCISE and EXORCISE. Ex- orcise, also spelled exorcize, means to drive out (an evil spirit). It should not be mixed up with the three -e verb exercise, meaning to exert, perform, do exercises, and so on. Some dictionaries offer the option of pronouncing the two words the same; others would enunciate the or in exorcise, a practice that could help to prevent confusion. When one “Jesus Christ Satan—a lo- cal street character” showed up in court, jingled bells, and began to speak in protest against a ruling canceling a spe- cial election, the judge cut him off. Thereupon this headline appeared in a newspaper: “J. C. Satan exercised.” Al- though Mr. Satan may have been exer- cised, in the sense of worried or upset, or possibly had worked out in a gymna- sium, a more likely explanation for the headline is a copy editor’s trying to be clever but not succeeding. EXOTIC. An exhibition of landscape art elicited a review containing this sen- tence: “Another theme that turns up re- peatedly is the exotic foreign locale.” To speak of “the exotic foreign locale” is al- most like saying “the foreign foreign lo- cale.” Foreign is the original meaning of exotic, which comes from the Greek word for outside. The sense of intro- duced from abroad and then the senses of strange and rare branched from that original meaning. Later, implications of aesthetics, charm, excitement, or fasci- nation overworked exotic further. That adjective is a frequent eu- phemism in the field of “adult” (i.e., sex- ual) entertainment. An “exotic dancer” may have spent her entire life in the United States and not learned any for- eign dance, as long as she is an alluring young woman who dances partly or wholly nude. What may explain the choice of “exotic” is that it looks so much like erotic. EXPECTED. It is hard enough for a reporter just to report the facts without trying to predict the future. Note this front-page headline: “C.I.A. Nominee Expected to Win Senate Backing.” But senators’ opposition to the nomination caused it to be withdrawn. Similarly a story telling what President Reagan was “expected” to tell the nation was not borne out, nor was a story telling how voters in Washington State were “ex- pected” to vote. Expected in such a context (the past participle of the transitive verb to expect ) means considered very likely or practically certain. Of what value was that word? And by whom was each event “expected”? Expletives. These amount to verbal appendixes. They are words or phrases that fill out sentences but have little meaning in themselves. In its popular sense, an expletive is an oath or swear word, like hell or damn or the obscene variety of four-letter word. In a grammatical sense, an expletive is a word or phrase that, while not neces- sary or even very meaningful, may serve a stylistic, rhythmic, or syntactical func- tion. It is and there is ( are, was, were ) are common expletives. When the pronoun it does not repre- 124 exercise and exorcise 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 124"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"sent a particular noun and the adverb there does not refer to a place, each word may start a sentence or clause without being the subject. Examples: “It is time now to talk business.” / “There’s a full moon out tonight.” The real sub- jects there are time and moon. It and there in such sentences are called antici- patory subjects or dummy subjects. Id- iom generally accepts them, although the ideas may be expressed in other ways; e.g., “Now is the time to talk business” or “A full moon is out tonight.” Many teachers and editors have long objected to expletives, considering their use weak, clumsy, or superfluous. Some- times it can be so: “There were six other specimens found” is better rewritten as “Six other specimens were found” or, still better, as “We found six other speci- mens.” Writers of impersonal letters are apt to write, e.g., “It is thought . . .” to avoid “I think. . . .” Scientists like to write impersonally, so it is not surprising that three studies on the same topic (passive smoking) by different researchers say in summaries, “There was a statistically significant dif- ference . . .” / “There was no evidence of any trend . . .” / “There was no associa- tion. . . .” Yet eminent literature contains many quotable examples: “It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done . . .” (Dickens). “Behold, there come seven years of great plenty . . .” (Bible, Genesis). “To every thing there is a season . . .” (Bible, Ecclesiastes). It and there fit the rhythm of many song lyrics and poems: “It was down in old Joe’s barroom . . .” / “’Twas [it was] the night before Christmas . . . When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter. . . .” Note that there may be accompanied by a singular or plural verb, depending on the noun that follows. “There is a lizard in my living room” but “There are two lizards in my kitchen.” To say “There were a cake and two pies on the table” is strictly correct but it may sound strange to some ears. Some writers would accept “There was a cake and two pies . . . ,” however ungrammatical. The dilemma may be resolved by putting the plural item first: “There were two pies and a cake . . .” It as an expletive is always followed by a singular verb: “It seems they lost their way.” / “It’s [it is] good we’re to- gether again.” In a construction like “It is the showers that bring [not “brings”] the flowers,” the verb following that agrees with the real subject (“showers”), not with the dummy subject it. ( See also WHO, 3. ) The purpose of that construc- tion is to emphasize the subject. An arti- cle said, “It’s their specific traits and biography—their background, their de- meanor—that is supposed to make us tune in.” That are. EXTORTION. See Crimes, 2. EYE (of a storm). The eye of a hurri- cane or other tropical cyclone is a fairly calm place. It is an approximately circu- lar area of rather light winds and com- paratively fair weather in the center of the storm. The narrator of a documentary film said, “At the eye of the hurricane, the wind can exceed 200 miles an hour.” He, or the writer, was wrong. In the eye, “winds diminish to something less than 15 knots” (about 17 statute miles per hour), a weather almanac says. That meteorological term is some- times misused in a figurative way when a person in the center of a controversy or furor is said to be “in the eye of the storm.” eye (of a storm) 125 01-A-E_4 10/22/02 10:29 AM Page 125"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"FABULOUS. Fabulous (adjective) primarily means pertaining to a fable or of the nature of a fable. That which is mythical, legendary, or imaginary may be described as fabulous. “Baron Mun- chausen was a real man, but his tales were fabulous.” The word came to have an additional meaning, describing something that is real but so marvelous that it would seem imaginary if you did not know it was real. “The fabulous notion of a trip to the moon became reality in 1969 .” In later years it entered popular speech as a slang synonym for very good, well done, impressive, successful, or any of numerous other terms of ap- proval. “The dinner was fabulous.” / “He did a fabulous job.” Such mundane use has become so widespread that it threatens to bury the specific meanings of fabulous. How is the word used in this sen- tence? On almost every other page, we find a classic California painting, such as William Alexander Coulter’s horrify- ing yet fabulous view—from the Bay—of San Francisco burning in “San Francisco Fire, 1906 .” Whether the writer meant that the scene was imaginary or that it was well painted is not certain. Contemporary speech has so watered down fabulous that when someone does use the word precisely, we may not know it. See also FANTASTIC; INCREDI- BLE. FACT. 1. Definition. 2. “The FACT that.” 3. Modifiers. 4. Synonyms. 1. Definition A fact is a statement that is known to be true or that has been proven to be true, whether by observation, research, or reliable testimony. Fact, as distinguished from fancy, fal- sity, fiction, or supposition, denotes ac- tuality, reality, or truth. 2. “The FACT that” The phrase the fact that often is used colloquially, and wrongly, for what is not fact. The expression sometimes ap- pears in serious writing (occasionally without “that”), for instance: “The lat- est deployment may reflect the fact that the government is thinking of launching a military attack.” It is speculation, not fact. Change “reflect the fact” to indi- cate. A radio talk show produced this dia- logue: [Hostess:] If your son made a girl pregnant, would you help her to get an abortion? 126 fabulous F 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 126"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"[Man calling:] I think I would. . . . [Hostess:] I’m surprised by the fact that he would help a girl of another family get an abortion. What surprised her was not a “fact” but an offhand response to a hypothetical question. Leaving out “by the fact” would have sharpened the sentence and not relinquished any meaning. A week later another man calling the program was questioned: [Hostess:] Your source for the fact that the Russian army is not being fed is what? The very question indicated her doubt that his statement was a fact. 3. Modifiers In a book about the book business, we read: It turns out that the researcher pro- vided his coauthor with incorrect facts. No, he provided him with incorrect statements or with misinformation. In strict usage, there cannot be “incorrect facts” or “false facts.” It is a contradic- tion. Superfluous adjectives like “correct” or “true” should not team up with facts either. [A prosecutor, as quoted in a newspa- per:] I only want to see the true facts presented. [An ex-senator on TV:] Americans in poll after poll, when informed of the true facts [about Medicare], say “Let’s fix it.” “True facts” is redundant. A fact is true by definition. While I was in the CIA [an ex-agent said in a magazine piece] I also helped prepare briefings for Congress for Mr. Colby. . . . Very few of the facts in these briefings were true. Then there were very few facts. Either re- place facts with another noun, like state- ments or details; or place an adjective, like supposed or purported, before facts. Such an adjective is almost implied in a popular expression: to get one’s facts (that is, one’s supposed facts) right or wrong or straight. Fact ( s ) can be legitimately modified in many ways. One may speak of a surpris- ing fact, a scientific fact, encouraging facts, all the facts, and so on. 4. Synonyms Fact in some contexts is interchange- able with actuality, reality or truth. The preposition in may precede any of those nouns, but the meanings are not neces- sarily the same. For instance, in fact of- ten serves merely to intensify the statement that is coming, whereas in re- ality is more apt to contrast the truth of what is to come with that of a previous statement. Information can be used as a syn- onym for facts, knowledge, or learning. It can be used in a neutral way also, to denote something that is told or a telling of something, regardless of the truth or falsity of what is told. If the information is wrong, it can be called misinforma- tion. A statement is an act of setting forth in words; also something stated or said, an account of something. Because it may not be true, it is not the same as a fact. Truth, the state or quality of being true or in accordance with fact or reality, can pertain to a particular statement (“Can you verify the truth of that state- ment?”) or to a generality (“When war is declared, truth is the first casualty”).

Special meanings. 1. General meaning A medical dictionary says about can- cer: There are probably many causative factors, some of which are known: for example, cigarette smoking is associ- ated with lung cancer, radiation with some bone sarcomas and leukemia. “Causative” is unnecessary. A factor is causative; that is, functioning as a cause. “There are probably many factors. . . .” When it is not used in a biological, commercial, or mathematical sense, a factor essentially is a cause. It is a cir- cumstance, condition, or element that contributes to an effect or a result. The meanings of cause and factor overlap, but only cause will do if an effect is known to have a single cause; factor im- plies one or more additional causes. The general sense of factor is a figura- tive use of its mathematical sense defined in 2. Factor is stuffed in innumerable sen- tences, either unnecessarily or impre- cisely. “Causative” and “causal” are among unnecessary modifiers. Another appears in the phrase “contributing fac- tor.” Factors contribute. “We have to think of the cost factor” probably can be shortened to “We have to think of the cost.” Touching on the difficulty in unscram- bling bad English, an essayist asks rhetorically: “And what about the time factor?” Could “factor” not be omitted, perhaps replaced by spent or wasted? Often factor is used when a more ap- propriate word would be circumstance, component, consideration, element, fact, feature, force, ingredient, or phase. In “Let’s review the factors leading up to this crime,” circumstances would be an apt replacement for “factors.” 2. Special meanings In biology, factor indicates an antigen, gene, or substance; the word is com- bined in terms such as Rh factor. This is an antigen discovered in red blood cells of rhesus monkeys and most people. Blood containing it is incompatible with blood lacking it. Factor has several commercial mean- ings. Often it is a person or company that makes loans secured by accounts re- ceivable or, sometimes, that purchases the accounts. An older sense is that of a commission merchant, an agent for the sale of goods. In mathematics, a factor is one of two or more quantities that form a specified product when multiplied together: 5 and 3 are factors of 15 . A related verb (tran- sitive) is factor, meaning to separate (a product) into factors. A synonym is fac- torize. An obsolete meaning of the noun fac- tor is one who does or makes something, its meaning in Latin. FACT- words. 1. Concerning facts. 2. Not concerning facts. 1. Concerning facts When an academic said on television, “The level of facticity has dropped on the part of both of the candidates,” was she using a recognized word? The noun facticity is defined in The Oxford English Dictionary as “The quality or condition of being a fact; fac- tuality.” It dates at least from 1945 . So the speaker used a word recog- nized by the most reputable dictionary, if not by her entire TV audience. A simpler phrasing: “Both candidates are getting away from facts.” The Oxford lists three related nouns. 128 facticity, faction, factious, factual, etc. 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 128"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"(The dates represent the dictionary’s ear- liest quotations.) • Factuality: “The quality of being factual; factualness” ( 1887 ). • Factualness: “The state of being factual; factuality” ( 1906 ). • Factualism: In philosophy, “A predominant concern with facts or natural consequences, especially in moral matters . . .” ( 1946 ). The common adjective factual means pertaining to, containing, or made up of facts; “a factual report.” In some con- texts it implies that something is real, not fabricated, at least in essence; “The movie is factual.” A less common adjective is factful: well acquainted with facts (said of a per- son) or full of facts (said of a literary work). Faction in the sense of fiction based on fact is a fairly new noun, not to be confused with its homonym below. 2. Not concerning facts Several words that begin with fact- have nothing to do with facts. Let us list them. • Faction (noun): a clique or a subgroup of a country, government, party, organization, etc.; also conflict or dissension within such an entity. “The city council has conservative and liberal factions. It is hampered by faction.” • Factional (adjective): pertaining to a faction or characterized by faction. • Factious (adjective): producing or causing faction; also, pertaining to or characterized by faction. “This factious election campaign is almost over.” / “The Vietnam conflict was especially factious.” • Factitious (adjective): unnatural, artificially produced by effort. “Sales, which had been slow, boomed when Madison Avenue set off a factitious demand for the product.” Factitious should not be confused with fictitious, which means written as fiction or created by the imagination and can, but need not necessarily, imply falsity and intent to deceive. (In the context of advertising, the confusion would be understandable.) • Factitive (adjective): in grammar, pertaining to a type of transitive verb. Its direct object takes a complement, and typically a making or rendering is described. In “They made him their leader,” made is a factitive verb. A journalist described a political party as “factionalized.” If he meant it was characterized by faction, either factional or factious would have expressed that meaning more economically. FACULTY. A faculty is a staff of an educational institution. It is the entire body of teachers in a college or univer- sity (“the faculty of Yale”) or in one of its departments (“the mathematics fac- ulty”). Some dictionaries broaden the definition to take in any type of school, and some include administrators as well as teachers. The writer of a main article in a uni- versity newspaper could not decide whether the word was plural or singular. In some sentences he made it plural: Some faculty . . . fear and loathe student evaluations of their teaching. . . . Many faculty thought the evalua- tion process was fine as is. . . . Faculty were not given enough research time. . . . Most faculty are expected to teach the equivalent of four classes per semester. In other sentences, intermingled with those above, he construed the word dif- ferently: faculty 129 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 129"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"The survey asked 78 faculty members questions. . . . Those faculty members eligible for tenure . . . must have their teaching evaluated by students. . . . Many had feared those faculty mem- bers might move on to greener aca- demic pastures. . . . The plural construction of the first set is not customary. Faculty is usually re- garded as singular. “The faculty was not given. . . .” / “Many faculty members thought. . . .” The second set is standard, although the inconsistency was worse than the errancy. Faculty is a collective noun compara- ble to class. No one says “Some class drop out” and “The class are many” in- stead of “Some class members drop out” and “The class is large. ” See also Collective nouns; STAFF. FANTASIA. See FANTASTIC. FANTASTIC. When a state’s educa- tion chief called on school districts to toughen academic requirements, the president of a parent-teacher association commented that “talk about higher stan- dards is fantastic.” And a member of the U.S. House of Representatives said about its speaker, “He’s making fantastic efforts on behalf of the American people.” Were they implying that talk of high standards and the House speaker’s ef- forts were bizarre, capricious, fanciful, grotesque, illusory, imaginary, odd, strange, or unreal? Fantastic primarily means pertaining to or characterized by fantasy, and it has those associated meanings. The contexts showed that each was using “fantastic” in a nonstandard sense to mean something like admirable, capi- tal, great, noteworthy, remarkable, splendid, superb, or any of dozens of re- lated words. A reviewer talked on the radio about the movie Titanic. “Only one word can describe it,” he said. Is the word titanic? No. “It is fantastic. ” That meant the film was characterized by fantasy, untrue to life, if he was speaking strictly. He prob- ably was not. In music, a fantasia is a free-form composition of nontraditional structure, emphasizing fancy over form. It may ei- ther stand alone or serve as the prelude for a fugue. Before playing a piano rendition of a Bach toccata and fugue on a radio pro- gram, a musician described some of its technicalities and called it a “fantastic” piece. In the context in which it was used, the word could have meant charac- teristic of a fantasia. At the end, how- ever, when he remarked, “It’s a fantastic thing,” it became apparent that his use of the word was not authentic. (But then neither was the music, which Bach had composed for the organ.) See also FABULOUS; INCREDIBLE. FAR. Discussing car thefts, in a radio interview, a police chief said of the Toy- ota, “It’s a very popular item as far as stripping the inside of the vehicle.” Strip- ping the as far as construction of is con- cerned (or another appropriate verb) is unfortunately becoming popular too. When the meaning is to the extent that or to the degree that, the noun that follows as far as or so far as must be fol- lowed by a verb: “As far as cats are con- cerned, the law is silent.” / “He is not a great actor as far as comedies go. ” The same rule applies to the phrase in- sofar as, or in so far as (as it is sometimes spelled), also meaning to the extent that or to the degree that. The noun that fol- lows it must be followed by a verb: “In- sofar as business grows, dividends will rise.” When as far as is followed by a noun representing a place, it may need no verb: “They rode as far as the border.” Nor does a verb have to follow when as 130 fantasia 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 130"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"far as or so far as indicates a limit of progress: “He went to school as far as the sixth grade.” As far as or insofar as often can be replaced, partly or entirely, by one small word or another: “As for cats . . .” / “. . . Actor in comedies” / “ If business grows. . . .” Two physicians and a congressman made these statements in three broad- casts: As far as frozen embryos, it’s amazing how good they are. As far as short-term toxicity, they’ve given human beings up to 6 , 000 mil- ligrams every night. As far as the loan, it raises questions. None of the three sentences accepts the “as far as” phrasing. In each, as for makes more sense. FARTHER and FURTHER. Do we go further or go farther? Each is a comparative form of far. Each is both adjective and adverb. Many careful writers and speakers observe a useful rule: Limit farther to the meaning of more far in the sense of ac- tual, physical distance that can be mea- sured (“I live farther from my office now”). Use further for other, more figu- rative meanings (“He went further into debt”). Further thus means more distant or distantly in degree, quantity, or time. The distinction should be encouraged to prevent ambiguities like this one, from an art review: The farther Cézanne got from the object in front of him, the more trou- ble he had. The sentence seems to say that the artist had trouble seeing and could not stand too far from the object he was painting. But the next sentence suggests that the reviewer is not to be taken literally. (“His allegories . . . are not remarkable paintings.”) Evidently he means that the more Cézanne departed from reality, the worse were his pictures. In that case, fur- ther should have been used, not “far- ther.” In both examples just below, it is clearer that measurable distances were not in the writers’ minds. Each “farther” should be further. . . . Britain . . . had already gone farther than its community partners by withdrawing its entire diplomatic staff from Teheran. . . . But as the would-be rebels were soon to be reminded, the farther Mr. Kohl is pushed, the more terrible is his recovery. Here is an example of a “further” that should be farther. A measurable distance is exactly what the writer had in mind. Novosibirsk, the largest city in the vast expanse of eastern Russia known as Siberia, is more than 1 , 500 miles southeast of Moscow and even fur- ther west of Vladivostok. . . . Change “further” to farther; or, better, change “even further” to more than 2,000 miles. The superlative forms of far bear the same relationship as the comparative forms. Farthest is most far in a literal sense: “Of the nine planets, Pluto is the farthest from the Sun.” Furthest is most far in a figurative sense: “Of the paint- ings on display, those by Dalí are the fur- thest from reality.” Those cool to the idea of distinguish- ing the words point to their interchange- able use at times by prominent writers. It is also a fact that neither word originally pertained to far. Further once was a farther and further 131 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 131"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"comparative of fore and meant more for- ward. Farther came later as a variation of further, having nothing to do with far. More far was farrer, which became ob- solete and was replaced by farther. Of the two words, only further is a verb (transitive), meaning to advance or assist: “They want to further our cause.” Another distinctive sense of further, as an adjective, is that of additional: “We need further help.” FATALITY. A fatality is ( 1 ) an occur- rence that results in death, or ( 2 ) a death resulting from an unexpected occur- rence. The word is misused in the ex- cerpts below, from news items and (the third) an editorial. Authorities said Patrick P——, of Kalamazoo, became the first hunting fatality of the season on Thursday when he accidentally shot himself in a cornfield while trying to unclog snow from his rifle. The unfortunate man fell victim to a hunting fatality, or a hunting fatality ended his life, or he became the first fatal victim of the hunting season. But the man himself could not become a “fatal- ity.” A 58 -year-old New York woman who died of the disorder in September is the first confirmed fatality in the outbreak, and several other deaths are still under investigation. . . . The driver of the Mercury became the 26 th fatality on Highway 37 in the past five years. In each case, the death was the fatality, not the person who died. Changing “fa- tality” to victim or fatal victim would be preferable to the present wording, which tends to convert human beings into statistics. See also Dehumanization. FATE. See DESTINY. FAUN and FAWN. Arthur Fiedler once conducted a symphony concert ti- tled “Pops Family Night at the Zoo.” The program included Carnival of the Animals, Tiger Rag, Under the Double Eagle, and Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun. That last selection seemed out of harmony with the zoo theme. Debussy’s faun— not to be confused with fawn, a baby deer—was an ancient Roman deity, part man and part goat. To the best of my knowledge, no zoo has ever had one. FAZE and PHASE. A woman was learning to fly a little airplane and enjoy- ing the experience, except for one thing. She wrote in a book: The only thing that phased me was when David [the instructor] demon- strated that Pegasus [the plane’s name] had pendular stability and could right herself from any twist; he swung the bar and she dived and soared. Correction: it fazed— not “phased”— her. Faze and phase (verbs, transitive) are pronounced the same but have different meanings and origins. ( See also WHEN, WHERE in definitions. ) To faze is to daunt, disconcert, or dis- turb one. It is used more often in the neg- ative than the positive. “Winter never fazes the Eskimos.” The word has pro- gressed from American dialect to collo- quial use, to standard use. It began as a variation of feeze (or feaze ), which came from the Old English fesian, to drive away (someone or something). To phase is to plan, schedule, or carry out something in phases or stages or as needed. It came from the Greek noun phasis, appearance or phase of the moon, which itself came from the verb phanein, to show. 132 fatality 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 132"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"To phase in or phase out something is to introduce it or eliminate it in phases or stages. A phase phrase can be useful, but it carries the flavor of bureaucratic or corporate jargon. If the idea is to gradually introduce or gradually elimi- nate something, it may be better to say so. Phase as a noun is a state of develop- ment or a temporary form of behavior or an event in a cycle of events. It can also be the way the moon, or another celes- tial body, or other body whose appear- ance changes periodically, appears at a certain time. FEATURE. To feature (verb, transi- tive) is to present as a prominent attrac- tion, display conspicuously, or publicize (a person, thing, topic, etc.). A music reviewer wrote, “The con- cert . . . featured an interminable inter- mission. . . .” The concert featured a noted pianist. It had or included an intermission or, the critic could say, was unduly stretched out by it; but the intermission was never presented as a prominent attraction. ( See also INTER- MINABLE. ) “The current issue features space travel” is a straightforward use of the verb. Occasionally someone reverses the subject and object, so that “Space travel features the current issue.” If one is de- termined to lead off with the highlighted topic, a way to do it sensibly is to replace “features” with a passive form, is fea- tured in. FEEL. A businessman admitted that he had made a $ 300 , 000 political contribu- tion in return for a meeting with the president. Thereupon a television com- mentator asked, “How are voters sup- posed to feel except incredibly cynically about the process?” Cynical (adjective), not “cynically” (adverb), would have been correct. When feel means to experience an emotion or perceive one’s own condi- tion, an adjective follows: “She feels happy,” not “happily”; and “I am recu- perated and feel strong now,” not “strongly.” ( Feel then serves as a linking verb. It links the subject, she or I, to the adjective, happy or strong. ) Feel itself is only occasionally modi- fied, for example: “We feel strongly that he is the best man for the country.” There the adverb strongly is right; “strong” would be incorrect. Some editors and critics have objected to feel in the sense of hold an opinion or take a stand. That common use need not be wholly abandoned, although feel can be wishy-washy when the import is “We declare ” or “My position is ” or “The Court finds. ” Feel suits an attitude, con- viction, or opinion tinged with emotion and vagueness, as opposed to reason and clarity.

FESTOON, FESTOONED. To fes- toon (verb, transitive) is to decorate with, or make into, or join, by means of a festoon. A festoon (noun) is a garland or string of flowers, leaves, ribbons, etc. hanging in a curve or loop between two points. A representation of such a hang- ing garland, say carved in furniture, may also be called a festoon. Does either of the samples (from a magazine and a newspaper) describe either kind of fes- toon? The walls all around Slonimsky’s work table are festooned with a festoon, festooned 133 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 133"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"gallery of ghoulish nonsense—bizarre tabloid headlines, M. C. Escher co- nundrums, a reproduction of an 1853 painting. . . . The walls may be adorned, decked, dec- orated, embellished, or merely covered with those things but are probably not truly festooned. (The sentence contains two other questionable uses: “ghoulish,” meaning fiendish, horrible, or loath- some, to describe the headlines and pic- tures; and “conundrums,” riddles whose answers are puns, applied to Escher’s pictures.) Mr. Krasilnikov said the city will still be festooned on holidays with cel- ebratory slogans and multistory por- traits of Lenin. Conceivably a slogan could be formed by letters joined on a festoon (although a slogan sign pictured with the excerpted news story was not festooned ), but it is difficult to imagine the festooning of multistory portraits. FETUS. See EMBRYO and FETUS. FEWER and LESS. 1. The differ- ence. 2. Exceptions. 1. The difference “We now have 200 , 000 less students in the state university system.” A candi- date for governor said that in a question- and-answer segment of a television news show, erroneously using “less” instead of fewer. A legal commentator and a network spokesman made essentially the same er- ror in broadcasts. The first said, concern- ing a criminal trial, “You’re going to see less and less objections.” The second said, about a reorganization of his com- pany, “It’s fair to say that there will be less jobs.” An article similarly erred: Employers like a hospital’s day care for ill children “because it means less days out of work for their employees.” As a rule of thumb: less goes with a singular; fewer goes with a plural. (Ex- ceptions are coming.) Less means not so much. It is a smaller quantity of a substance (“less he- lium”) or type of object (“less fruit”) or a smaller amount or degree of an ab- stract thing (“less excitement”) or de- scriptive quality (“less brilliant”). Fewer means not so many. It is a smaller number of objects (“fewer co- conuts” or “fewer heavenly bodies”) or other things that can be counted and that are considered individually (“fewer pleasures” or “fewer challenges”). See also MANY and MUCH. 2. Exceptions Even if a word is in plural form, less applies if the thing represented is consid- ered as a unit. We commonly regard an amount of money, a period of time, or a measure of weight or distance as a unit. In the sentence “The book costs less than $ 20 ,” we think of a single sum, not of individual dollars. In the sentences “She is less than six months old” / “The machine weighs less than nine pounds” / “The station is less than two miles from here,” we think of a single period of time, a total weight, and a total distance, not of months, pounds, and miles con- sidered individually. The distinction is not always clear- cut. Grammatical authorities have not agreed on where to draw the lines. H. W. Fowler favored “ less troops or clothes, ” finding such plurals “really equivalent to singulars of indefinite amount.” After “ less, ” his reviser, Sir Ernest Gowers, in- serted “(or fewer ).” A book on word usage quotes this anonymous sentence and says that “less” should be fewer: “The nation’s traffic death toll . . . was 377 —thirteen less than the . . . pre-holiday estimate.” 134 fetus 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 134"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"But the anonymous writer had regarded the toll as a unit: it “was 377 .” Had he thought of the human victims repre- sented by that figure and written that “ 377 people died in traffic accidents,” fewer would clearly need to follow “thir- teen.” Perhaps his shortcoming was less grammatical than philosophical.

Other issues and uses. 1. FINE, FINELY, and FINE-TUNE You may finely chop onions but not “fine” chop them. A news agency made such an error: On May 6 , the treaty’s 75 ratifiers are expected to meet at The Hague to fine tune its management and enforce- ment provisions. The simplest correction is to insert the hyphen that belongs in the verb fine- tune. As an alternative, change “fine tune” to refine or change “fine” to finely. Finely is an adverb, meaning in a fine manner. Fine as an adverb (“She sings fine”) is acceptable in conversation or casual writing but never before the verb. Fine is mainly an adjective. Its mean- ings include tiny ( fine particles); thin ( fine thread); sharp ( fine edge); subtle ( fine distinctions); pure or up to a stan- dard ( fine gold); and, colloquially, in good health (“I’m fine—how are you?”). 2. Other issues and uses Fine in the sense of admirable or ex- cellent (“a fine poem”) used to draw some objections, but it is widely ac- cepted now. If anything, it is weakened from overuse. People toss off “fine” in conversation when other words—some- times merely all right or O.K.— would be more fitting. Among its uses, fine (noun) is a mone- tary punishment or (verb) to impose it. In music scores, fine does not describe the music: it is Italian for the end (and pronounced FEE-nay). Fine once meant that in English. Fire. See FLAMMABLE (etc.). FIRE (verb). See LAY OFF and LAY- OFF; LET GO. FIRM. Each of these paragraphs, from newspapers, contains a contradiction: Apple Computer Inc. is expected to unveil its much-heralded “Lisa” per- sonal computer model today. . . .

Maxwell put up $ 30 million for an 18 percent share of Teva Pharma- ceutical Industries Ltd., one of Israel’s largest and most profitable firms. The contradiction is that each company is incorporated—as indicated by “Inc.” or “Corp.” or “Ltd.”—but called a “firm.” Being a corporation, it is not a “firm.” A firm is a partnership. It is “a busi- ness or professional association of two or more persons as distinguished from an incorporated company” ( Encyclope- dia of Banking & Finance ). Partners of a firm may be sued as individuals if dam- ages are claimed from the business. That is not so for officers of a corporation. firm 135 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 135"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"The law treats a corporation as if it were a separate person.

A synonym is inflammable, which used to be a more common word. Those con- cerned with fire safety have promoted the use of the adjective flammable, be- cause some people think that the other word means nonflammable or noncom- bustible. The in- in inflammable does not mean “not”; the word originates in the Latin inflammare, to kindle, the origin of the English verb inflame. A manufacturer of woolen products stated in a leaflet, “Wool is . . . light, soft, non-flamable and durable.” The state- ment contains errors in spelling and fact: Nonflammable, has a double m. (The hyphen is optional.) And, while wool is considered flame-resistant, it can burn. FLAUNT and FLOUT. Addressing television cameras, a senator said the U.S. administration in its foreign policy “has spent seven years flaunting the law”; a prosecutor said, “No one is free to flaunt the tax laws”; and a journalist said “She [a hotel owner] thought she could flaunt the law. . . .” All were wrong. To flaunt is to show off. (“He became rich and flaunted his wealth.” / “She profits from flaunting her body in pub- lic.”) Flout, meaning to show contempt for or to scoff at, or flouting (the present participle), is what should have been used by each speaker. The two verbs (transitive) are poles apart. None of the flouters would flaunt their flouting. FLOCK, FLOCKING. See DROVE. FLOODED. See INUNDATE, IN- UNDATED. FLOUNDER and FOUNDER. The main headline in a daily newspaper said, “S.F. kids flounder in math on state test.” Could the copy editor have been floundering and grasping the wrong f- word? The story reported that many public school youngsters in San Fran- cisco had done poorly in the mathemati- cal portion of a statewide academic test. In other words, they had foundered in that part of the test. To flounder (verb, intransitive) is to move clumsily, to plunge about awk- wardly, or to speak or act in a confused way. Lexicographers are uncertain of its origin. Some assume that it came from founder. They do not trace it to the fish, although a snared flounder certainly flounders; so does a cod, trout, etc. when caught, but if the fish helps one to re- member the word, good for it. 136 fiscal and physical 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 136"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"To founder (verb, intransitive) is to fail, to collapse, or to break down. It can also mean (for ships) to sink, (for horses) to fall or become lame, or (for buildings or land) to cave in. Founder (verb, tran- sitive) can mean to cause (something) to founder. The verb comes from the Old French word fondrer, to sink, which stemmed from the Latin word fundrus, bottom. There is a noun flounder, besides the fish, meaning the act of floundering. The noun founder can mean the act of foundering; or soreness in a horse’s foot. It has two additional meanings unrelated to the verb founder: one who founds in the sense of establishing (e.g., a college) and one who founds in the sense of cast- ing metal. FLOUT.

FORBID, FORBADE. 2. PRO- HIBIT; BAN. 3. PROHIBITION; BAN. 1. FORBID, FORBADE A narrator on a national TV “maga- zine” said, “FDA regulations at that time forbid using that blood.” He used the present tense; he needed the past. The past tense of forbid is either forbade (pronounced for-BAD or for-BAYED) or forbad (pronounced for-BAD). When a problem with forbid arises, more often it is not in the verb itself (transitive) or its forms but in what fol- lows it. For example: Luzhkov demonstrated his muscle in 1994 when he forbade the federal government from privatizing large in- dustries located in Moscow. Nobody is forbidden “from” doing any- thing. The preposition that commonly follows any form of forbid is to. Thus “They forbid us to enter.” / “You’re for- bidden to smoke there” or “Smoking is forbidden there.” / “. . . He forbade the federal government to privatize large in- dustries. . . .” 2. PROHIBIT; BAN The verb prohibit (transitive) is often followed by from: “They prohibited the company from selling the product” (not “prohibited . . . to sell”). Forbid and prohibit have substan- tially the same meaning: to order a per- son or persons not to take certain action; or to make a rule against some action. Prohibit, however, has a ring of legality to it. A parent tells a child, “I forbid you to leave the house tonight” or “I forbid your leaving the house tonight.” An or- dinance “prohibits motorists from park- ing” or “prohibits parking” itself or says that “parking is prohibited” at a certain location. The verb ban (transitive) is similar to prohibit and means to proscribe some action or some thing, especially by law or religious authority. Ban implies a strong condemnation of that which is proscribed. “They banned the book.” / “He was banned from entering the coun- try.” 3. PROHIBITION; BAN Ban is also a noun, meaning an offi- cial disapproval, decree, or sentence, aimed at preventing or outlawing some- thing. It can be also a condemnation or excommunication by church authorities, and it can be a curse. A noun related to prohibit is prohibi- tion. One speaks of “the prohibition of alcohol” but “the ban on alcohol. Nouns related to forbid are forbid- forbid, prohibit, and ban 137 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 137"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"ding and, a rare one, forbiddance. A re- lated adjective is forbidden, as in “for- bidden fruit.” It is also the past participle of the verb: “They have forbidden him to enter the country.” Forbidding has a much different meaning as an adjective: repellent owing to an appearance of danger or unpleas- antness. A music critic wrote of a com- poser’s “distinguished and forbidding reputation,” thereby praising and dis- praising him in the same phrase. FORCEFUL and FORCIBLE. See Confusing pairs. FOREVER. The quotation is from an author’s account of a flight over Mali. Is anything wrong? “I could ride east from there for miles, the sands went on for ever.” One problem lies in the adverb “for ever.” It is not the division of for and ever, an older style that is just as valid as the union of the two components in for- ever if used consistently. It is that forever, or for ever, pertains to time, not space. It means ( 1 ) for eternity, for all time (“The universe will last forever”), or ( 2 ) inces- santly, continually (“That dog is forever barking”). The title and title song of the musical play On a Clear Day You Can See Forever, an anomaly that alluded to a character’s ability to foresee the future, may have helped to spread the wrong idea. The meaning of the quotation can be expressed in many ways: “The sands went on and on” / “seemed endless” / “stretched to the horizon” / “lay as far as the eye could see,” et cetera. (Another mistake in the sample is the improper fusion of two sentences. Either change the comma to a colon or semi- colon, or change it to a period and let The start a new sentence. See Run-on sentence, 2. ) FOREWORD and FORWARD. The foreword of a small book is headed, in large letters, “FORWARD.” No one literate in English should mix up the two words; their confounding is a blunder in- deed for an author to make and an edi- tor to overlook. (Perhaps it is poetic license. The book is a rhyming dictio- nary.) Another book (this time a cookbook) combines part of each word in “FORE- WARD.” Foreword (noun), a front note in a book, is made up of two fairly obvious four-letter words. As commonly used, it represents a nineteenth-century Angli- cization of the German word for preface, vorwort, which combines vor, fore, and wort, word. It should not be confused with for- ward (adjective and adverb), whose suf- fix is -ward, meaning in a certain direction. The prefix has the same mean- ing in both words, fore or front, though forward lacks an e. This word descended from the Old English foreweard. “FOR FREE.” See FREE, 1. FORMER. Former (pronoun) is the opposite of latter. The former refers to the first of two things—only two—that have been mentioned. “Their ham and eggs are good, particularly the former.” Often it is clearer to repeat a word or phrase: “particularly the ham.” When three or more items are enu- merated—“We saw zebras, giraffes, and lions” —former cannot be used. It is best to repeat the first item: “The zebras were especially plentiful.” If it is too long, the first or the first-named or the first of those are possibilities. Former (adjective) can mean previous, past, taking place earlier, or coming be- fore in order. The meaning is not always immedi- ately clear. Confusion can enter when former refers to something that is men- tioned first but came later in time. A book on international law tells of the founding of the Permanent Court of Ar- 138 forceful and forcible 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 138"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"bitration in 1899 and a proposal in 1907 to supplement it with a Court of Arbitral Justice: The CAJ was . . . designed to . . . coex- ist with the PCA. . . . The implication was clear that states would quickly grow to prefer adjudication over arbi- tration since the former institution supposedly more nearly coincided with their vital national security inter- ests. . . . Inasmuch as the 1907 event came later, the Court of Arbitral Justice should have been repeated by name, or initials, in- stead of described as “the former institu- tion.” Another temporal problem is illus- trated by a sentence from a news item. The statement cannot be true: Haynsworth was nominated for the U.S. Supreme Court by former President Nixon on Aug. 18 , 1969 , but the Senate later rejected the nomi- nation on a 55 -to- 45 vote. No one can be nominated to the Supreme Court by a “former” president. It would be enough to say, “Hayns- worth was nominated . . . by President Nixon. . . .” Anyone who read the story (years after the famous resignation) would almost certainly have known that Nixon was no longer president. If in doubt, the writer could have made it per- fectly clear by writing, “Haynsworth was nominated . . . by then President Nixon. . . .” See also Anachronism, 3; ERST- WHILE; LATTER. FORMIDABLE. Formidable (adjec- tive) originates in the Latin formido, meaning fear. Dictionaries in the past generally stuck to the ideas of ( 1 ) arous- ing fear or dread of any encounter; ( 2 ) being alarming or forbidding in appear- ance, difficulty, strength, etc. They essen- tially agreed also on the pronunciation: FOR-mid-a-bull. In recent decades some users have stretched the word nearly to meaning- lessness, without a trace of its original el- ement of apprehension. It has been used in place of big and impressive. One dic- tionary even gives “admirable” as a meaning. While a television documentary pic- tured Jidda, Saudi Arabia, a narrator commented, “It’s the formidable face of a booming economy.” Impressive? Handsome? Whatever he meant, aside from empty alliteration, omitting “formidable” would not have hurt. He pronounced it for-MID-a-bull, a non- standard pronunciation heard at other times from a U.S. senator and three broadcasters. FORSAKE. The Los Angeles Police Department “forsaked its officers,” a lawyer said on television, using a non- word. Forsook is the proper past tense of the verb (transitive) forsake. In the context above, forsake means to abandon or desert (someone or some- thing). It can mean also to renounce or give up (something). Its other forms: “She has forsaken me” (past participle), “They are forsaking us” (present partici- ple), and “He forsakes you” (present tense, third person, singular). “FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT.” See REASON, 3. FORTUITOUS. Fortuitous (adjec- tive) means coming about by accident or by chance or without plan. A newspaper article told about a hos- pital’s new, state-supported program to provide schooling for juvenile patients. The head of the pediatrics department was quoted. “This program was fortuitous be- cause just in the last 30 days we got new hospital accreditation guidelines fortuitous 139 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 139"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"that state that, if we provide treat- ment for infants and children, we must provide for their education if they are hospitalized for long periods of time,” E—— said. The administrator was mixed up and the reporter probably was too. They may have confused “fortuitous” with a com- bination of felicitous, meaning apt or ap- propriate, and fortunate, meaning lucky. Either word would have been a better choice than “fortuitous.” That which is fortuitous may be inter- preted as appropriate or inappropriate, lucky or unlucky. Natural disasters are fortuitous. Like felicitous, it is a four- syllable word beginning with f and end- ing with -itous. It shares the first five letters of fortunate. Otherwise fortuitous has little in common with the other two adjectives. The Latin equivalents and an- cestors of fortuitous and fortunate are fortuitus and fortunatus, which in the distant past evidently had a common root in fors, chance, luck. A book by two scientific writers ap- pears to suggest that accident and uncer- tainty pervade the universe. The components of such a universe could truly be called fortuitous. In the follow- ing example, no problem appears up to the second comma. For some people, the exceedingly fortuitous arrangement of the physi- cal world, which permits the very spe- cial conditions necessary to human observers’ existence, confirms their belief in a creative Designer. In this example, felicitous would itself be more felicitous than “fortuitous.” Fortu- nate also would pass muster. A similar problem appears in another book, by a traveler telling about car trouble in Africa. Within a few moments, the engine fired. The mechanic danced a few steps and doffed his hat just as the boy on the bicycle returned holding up a tube triumphantly. Never had so many fortuitous omens graced us at once. This time “fortuitous” would well be re- placed by favorable. An adverb related to fortuitous is for- tuitously. A related noun is fortuitous- ness. FORTUNATE. See FORTUITOUS. FORTUNE. See DESTINY. FORWARD and BACK (time). When daylight-saving time arrives in the spring, we are advised to move our clocks “forward” one hour; that is, move them in the direction in which clocks automatically move. Turning the clock “back,” say from 2 a.m. to 1 a.m., is what we are advised to do in the fall when standard time returns. The mne- monic “Spring forward, fall back ” does not help some people, who misunder- stand those adverbs and arrive at places two hours late or two hours early. An announcing of a shift in time re- quires caution. The new hour or date needs to be stated precisely. The manager of a television station decided to start its network programs at 7 p.m. instead of 8 p.m. A newspaper re- ported that she was “moving prime time forward one hour.” Sometimes forward (as an adjective) can indeed mean early: “A forward con- tingent is on its way.” But forward (as an adverb) can refer also to the future: “From this day forward” / “I look for- ward to the party.” Similarly, back can suggest an earlier time to some (“Think back to your school days”), a later time to others (who may recall the movie Back to the Future ). If a meeting originally scheduled for May 3 is postponed, or put off, to May 10 , is it moved “ahead” one week?

All three words stem from the Latin fundus, bottom, yet their meanings are not all similar. The writer of this sentence did not know that fundament bears only su- perficial resemblance to fundamental: “That event was the fundament of Polish nationalism.” Foundation, meaning base, basis, or founding, would have been a better choice of nouns. Fundamental is a basic principle or (as an adjective) basic or es- sential. Take away -al and we have fun- dament, meaning anus or buttocks. FOUNDER. See FLOUNDER and FOUNDER. FRACTION. When the anchor man for a television network placed President Gorbachev’s salary at $ 30 , 000 a year and remarked, “It’s a mere fraction of the $ 250 , 000 that President Bush makes,” was he saying anything wrong? Strictly speaking, any number below one is a fraction. Nine-tenths or even 99 / 100 is a fraction and it is not small and not subject to the modifier “mere” or “only.” (In mathematics, any number with a numerator and denominator can be called a fraction, even if it exceeds one; for example, 3 / 2 .) On the other hand, one-twentieth could be described as a small fraction of something, one- thousandth a tiny fraction. Therefore it is not reasonable to re- strict fraction to a small part, a little piece, or a minute fragment. Neverthe- less such use is entrenched in popular speech. That fact may acquit the tele- caster of verbal malfeasance but not of verbosity. Obviously $ 30 , 000 is a frac- tion of $ 250 , 000 . Had he made a calcu- lation and reported, “It’s a mere 12 percent of the $ 250 , 000 ,” at least he would be imparting information. A press example also deals with Rus- sia: . . . The total of about 7 , 000 work- ing churches is only a fraction of the 54 , 000 that existed before the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. A replacement for “is only a fraction of” might have been “is only 13 percent of” or (if the writer could not handle the arithmetic problem) “ contrasts with. ” Another example is in Gerund, 3A.

He writes that the public distrusts science, adding: This distrust is evident in the cartoon figure of the mad scientist working in his laboratory to produce a Franken- stein. Nobody produces a Frankenstein (ex- cept, perhaps, Mr. and Mrs. Franken- stein). Frankenstein in Mary Shelley’s 1818 novel of that name was not the monster but its creator, Victor Franken- stein. The monster, which ultimately killed him, had no name. The term Frankenstein’s monster or Frankenstein monster may be applied to any creation that escapes from the cre- ator’s control and threatens to, or actu- ally does, crush him. “Nuclear energy is Frankenstein’s monster,” or “In develop- ing nuclear energy, man created a Frankenstein monster.” frankenstein 141 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 141"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"“FREAK ACCIDENT.” No news story of a distinctive accident is complete unless the reporter drags in this phrase. It is never a freakish or freaky accident, to use a bona fide adjective, but a “freak” one. Sometimes the happening is not even very freakish, freaky, or “freak.” For in- stance, a network anchor man described “a freak accident” in which a tree was blown down upon a van. And a newspa- per reported “a freak accident” in which debris on a highway stopped a truck, causing it to be hit from behind by an- other truck. FREE. 1. FREE and “FOR FREE.” 2. FREE and FREELY. 1. FREE and “FOR FREE” Two news magazines, which normally prize conciseness, ran the following two sentences, each containing a useless word. Perry planned to lease the planes to Jordan for free. . . . Soldiers, trying to build good will, cut hair for free [in China]. “For” serves no purpose in those sen- tences or in these two, found in newspa- pers: Since Oct. 1 , Capital Metropolitan Authority patrons have been riding city buses for free. . . . The company has grown from 300 outlets in 1980 in part on its boast it would deliver the pizza for free if its drivers were late. People are being offered the planes, the haircuts, the bus rides, and the pizza free or free of charge or for nothing, but not “for free.” Free serves as an adverb, whereas nothing is a noun. The preposi- tion “for” makes no more sense with free than with the adverb expensively. Whether the illegitimate phrase origi- nated in a mistaken analogy with for nothing or in a conscious attempt at cuteness is not known. (The last quoted sentence, while con- taining a surplus word, omits a desirable word after “boast”: the conjunction that. ) See also Prepositions, 7. 2. FREE and FREELY Freely is an alternative to free as an adverb meaning in an unrestrained or unlimited manner. The horses run freely or free.

It means not just full, but dis- tastefully so; offensive to the senses, es- pecially by being excessive or insincere: “Belshazzar’s fulsome feast” / “Castro’s fulsome promises.” Although in Middle English fulsom meant simply full or abundant, it took on a negative connotation. Perhaps ful suggested foul. Anyway, in modern En- glish it combines the idea of abundance with the idea of excess or insincerity. 142 “freak accident” 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 142"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"One of those fooled was a TV net- work’s chief anchor man. He said, in de- scribing Robert Dole’s last day in Congress: And so the senator leaves the Senate with the most fulsome praise ringing in his ears. The broadcaster probably did not intend to describe the praise as excessive or in- sincere, but that is essentially what he said. Although some opposing partisans may have secretly agreed with such an assessment, another expression would have been preferable, say a lavish chorus of praise. (That corrects the misuse and ties in with the ear-ringing theme.) FUN. The first time I heard someone say anything like “It’s so fun,” I was in Europe and appreciated that the woman talking to me could speak my language at all. But for an American television re- porter to speak of “the career that had looked so fun and so glorious” could not be easily condoned. A substitute for “so fun” would have been like such fun or so full of fun or so enjoyable. Fun is properly a noun, usually mean- ing enjoyment or merriment, or a source of it. “We had fun.” / “This game is fun.” (As a noun, it is modified only by an adjective—e.g., “ great fun” or “ some fun”—not by an adverb. In a sentence such as “It seems so enjoyable” or “ so funny,” so is an adverb, modifying a predicate adjective.) Fun is partially accepted as an adjec- tive before the noun (attributive adjec- tive). Informally people may speak of “a fun trip” or “a fun city.” In a superlative misuse, a departing talk show host said, “It was probably the funnest two years I ever spent.” FUND. In the sense of money avail- able for use, funds is a plural noun. A company reported to stockholders: For the three months ended June 30 . . . funds from operations was $ 45 , 521 , 000 . . . . Revenues . . . were $ 62 , 173 , 000 . . . . Funds from opera- tions for the six months ended June 30 . . . was $ 85 , 990 , 000 . . . . Rev- enues . . . were $ 12 , 500 , 000 . . . . “Funds . . . were, ” just as “revenues were.” A singular phrasing would be “ income from operations was $ 45 , 521 , 000 .” A fund, singular noun, is a supply of money set aside for a specific purpose (the emergency fund ); or a supply of something else (a fund of knowledge). FUNDAMENTAL and FUNDA- MENT. See FOUNDATION, FUN- DAMENTAL, and FUNDAMENT. FURIOUS, FURIOUSLY. See FUROR and FURY. FUROR and FURY. Fury (noun) is violent action or violent rage: “the fury of the battle” / “the storm’s fury.” A tabloid headline screamed, “FURY OVER CLAIM IKE KILLED 1 M GER- MAN POWs.” The article did not bear out the headline. A book about Eisen- hower was not met with “fury” (as The Satanic Verses was, for instance). How- ever, on the basis of the article, the book could be said to have created a mild furor. Furor can range in intensity from harmless to violent. It can be a fad, a public commotion or uproar, a state of high excitement, a frenzy, or violent anger or fury. ( Furore is a variation in the sense of a fad. It is mainly British, an import from Italy.) Both words have the same Latin root, furere, to rage. Furious (adjective) and furiously (ad- verb) can mean full of or with fury, im- plying violence; or it can mean fierce(ly) furor and fury 143 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 143"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"or vehement(ly) without the implication of violence.

A chess maneuver in which a player sacrifices a pawn or piece to try to gain an advantage is a gambit. Usu- ally it occurs at the beginning of a game and involves a pawn. Gambit or open- ing gambit may be used figuratively, outside of chess, to denote an early con- cession, as in diplomacy or business ne- gotiation. Looser uses of that noun in place of opening move, opening remark, maneu- ver, move, strategy, have become wide- spread, dulling the word. Magazines have described a remark to initiate a conversation as a “conversational gam- bit” and a move in Congress as a “leg- islative gambit.” Those uses omit the main element of a gambit: the sacrifice. GAMBLING and GAMING. To bet or risk money on the outcome of a contest or of a game of chance is gam- bling (noun). A euphemism for it is gam- ing, used by those who advocate or play a role in legal gambling. The word gambling was scarcely used in an initiative measure to make it easy to put gambling devices and games of chance on Indian reservations in Califor- nia, but “gaming” appeared hundreds of times. The Nevada Gaming Control Board regulates gambling casinos in that state. The word gambling has had disrep- utable associations; gaming, like games, sounds clean and recreational. General dictionaries consider them synonyms. GAMUT. See GANTLET and GAUNT- LET, 2. GANTLET and GAUNTLET. 1. The difference. 2. GAMUT. 3. More meanings. 1. The difference Confusion between these two words is rampant. The main use of either is in a common expression. The historian Francis Parkman wrote: They descended the Mississippi, run- ning the gantlet between hostile tribes. A radio newscaster said, referring to gun battles between drug dealers: Residents have to run a gauntlet just to get to their front door. And this was in a news agency’s dis- patch: [Kenneth Starr] must run a daily gant- let of reporters and cameras just to leave his driveway. gantlet and gauntlet 145 G 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 145"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Is it “gantlet” or “gauntlet”? Ameri- can tradition leans toward the former. The latter, a British import, has become more common in colloquial use. Both are corruptions. Originally one ran the gantlope. A gantlope, from the Swedish gatlopp, was used in a punishment of thieves and then of soldiers. It consisted of two rows of men facing one another and holding such objects as sticks and knotted cords. The offender was stripped to the waist and forced to run the gantlope as the others struck him. It was not long before people began confusing gantlope with a then familiar word, gauntlet, a type of glove, of which gantlet was a variant. The first quotation of gantlope in The Oxford English Dic- tionary is from 1646 ; fifteen years later “run the gantlet” appears; afterward we see both gauntlets and gantlets as well as gantlopes. The phrase was used almost from the start in both a literal and a figurative sense. Today it is nearly always used fig- uratively, meaning to suffer attacks, par- ticularly from two sides; to risk perils; or even to endure any series of troubles. Literally “run the gauntlet” is like saying “run the old glove.” A gauntlet was an armored glove of medieval times. A man who cast his gauntlet to the ground was issuing a challenge to fight. If another picked it up, he was accepting the challenge. The custom gave rise to the expressions throw down the gauntlet and take up the gauntlet, meaning to is- sue or accept a challenge. To run the gantlet is favored by four works on English usage and the manuals of the Associated Press and The New York Times. It was the preferred term in American dictionaries through 1960 . Later dictionaries have offered both spellings for each sense. The books have never agreed on pronunciation. The sug- gestion here is to pronounce the words as they are spelled, GANT-let and GAUNT-let, and to use the former for running and the latter for throwing down. All sources agree that only the gauntlet is thrown down. 2. GAMUT Gamut (noun), which appears in the expression run the gamut, usually means the complete range or extent of things; for instance, “The chefs ran the gamut of flavors.” It is sometimes confused with the other g- words. This was from a news re- port: “Prisoners were forced to run a gamut.” Gantlet would be right, not “gamut.” The host of a talk show said, “Once someone has served as president, he has run the full gauntlet of accom- plishment.” Gamut, not “gauntlet.” “A complete gamut of colors,” a dic- tionary’s example, unnecessarily modi- fies gamut. A gamut is complete. Gamut (from gamma and ut, me- dieval musical notes) denoted the musi- cal scale in medieval times. It has since been applied to the whole series of rec- ognized musical notes or, sometimes, to just the major scale. 3. More meanings Gantlet is also a railroad term. It is a section where two tracks overlap, en- abling a train from either line to pass in a narrow place. Gauntlet for glove is not wholly obso- lete. Certain types of work and dress gloves and glovelike athletic devices are known as gauntlets. GAS. 1. Confusion. 2. Definitions. 1. Confusion An automobile company was selling a low-pollution van, “powered by natural gas instead of gas,” a news agency re- ported. On its face, the quoted phrase seems to part with logic. Natural gas is a gas. No doubt the writer meant gasoline, for 146 gas 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 146"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"which “gas” is a common, colloquial American term. Displayed in serious writing, it does not fare well. When it is being contrasted with the real gas, “gas” is particularly ill-chosen. It can perplex those who are unaccustomed to informal Americanisms and do not recognize it as the British petrol. A newspaper article used the phrase “gas tax” eleven times (counting the headline), never once spelling out the topic: the federal gasoline tax. Even Americans are not always sure what is meant by, say, “I smell gas.” 2. Definitions Gas is a substance that is neither solid nor liquid and is characterized by very low density and readiness to expand and fill its container. The Flemish chemist J. B. van Helmont ( 1577 – 1644 ), who dis- covered carbon dioxide and distin- guished gases from liquids and solids, coined the word, basing it on the Greek khaos, chaos. In colloquial use, gas means gasoline; in slang use, empty or boastful talk. Gasoline is a flammable, liquid mix- ture of hydrocarbons, obtained in the distillation of petroleum and used as a fuel in internal-combustion engines. Natural gas is a mixture of gaseous hydrocarbons, mainly methane, found in the earth in oil deposits and used as a fuel. Petrol, the British term for gasoline, is pronounced PET-trull. GAUNTLET. See GANTLET and GAUNTLET. GAVE and GIVEN. See Tense, 5A. GAY. 1. History. 2. The press. 3. Two meanings. 1. History Gay is an adjective that, for seven cen- turies, has primarily meant joyful, light- hearted, merry, or mirthful. Chaucer, for instance, wrote that a pilgrim “iolif [jolly] was and gay.” It can also mean bright or showy. Tennyson: “when all is gay with lamps.” Probably of Teutonic origin, the word came to Middle English from the French gai. The use of gay in the above senses dates back at least to 1310 , antedating Chaucer, The Oxford English Dictio- nary indicates. Records of its occasional euphemistic use to mean a man “of loose and immoral life” begin in 1637 ; a woman, 1825 . Its use as a euphemism for the adjective homosexual did not be- come popular until close to 1970 , al- though rare uses dating from the 1880 s are documented. Used in the sense of homosexual, the adjective gay used to be considered slang but now is accepted as standard by all dictionaries. Gay as a noun, meaning a homosexual person, has been so ac- cepted by American dictionaries but is considered slang by the Oxford. 2. The Press The publicly sold style manual of The New York Times disapproves of gay for homosexual, although in 1987 the staff was told that the adjective was accept- able. ( Gay could describe both sexes, but lesbian was preferred in specific refer- ences to women.) However: The noun will continue to be homo- sexual ( s ). Thus we’ll write gay author, but not “a gay”; gay men (or homo- sexuals ) but NOT “gays.” The distinction made grammatical sense. If someone can be “a gay,” can someone else not be “a sad” or “a tall”? Most of the press had been quicker to adopt gay in the sexual sense, particu- larly in headlines, where news essences must be squeezed into small spaces. Be- ing able to replace a ten-letter word with a three-letter word pleases a typical edi- gay 147 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 147"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"tor. So to see a headline in 1990 in a San Francisco newspaper saying “Homosex- ual rights law challenged” was surpris- ing, particularly when the text of the article said: Federal courts have found that gays are not protected against bias by the U.S. Constitution. Gov. Deukmejian vetoed a bill in 1984 to give gays equal rights under state law. [A mis- placed prepositional phrase produces “bias by the U.S. Constitution.” See Modifiers, 3. ] The same paper ran the headline “A GAY BASHER ASKS: WHY?” Was he a basher who was gay? No, but that sense results from the adjectival use of a noun adopted from an adjective. Homosexuals themselves have em- braced gay, as adjective and noun, al- though many originally resisted it. Some of them annually celebrate “Gay Pride Day.” No one has explained why a eu- phemism is needed for that which one takes pride in. 3. Two meanings Harper Dictionary ( 1985 ) reported that only 36 percent of a usage panel of 166 members accepted the modern sense of gay. Some expressed anger. Isaac Asi- mov: “This use of ‘gay’ has killed a won- derful word. . . .” Erich Segal: “It robs our language of a lovely adjective. . . .” While gay in the traditional sense, that of merry or bright, can at times be mis- understood—“It was a gay party” per- mits two interpretations—reports of its demise have been exaggerated. Anyone who wants to use the word in that way has a perfect right to do so but should see that the context makes the meaning clear. It was clear in a 1990 article in the The New York Times: But today the only people walking in Red Square were tourists who had come to ogle the gay domes of St. Basil’s Cathedral. See also HOMOPHOBIA. GENDARME. Americans who use the word gendarme think it is French for policeman. They are partly right, as right as a European would be in using “con- stable” or “sheriff” for an American po- liceman. A movie guide book describes the plot of the 1963 film Irma la Douce: “A gen- darme pulls a one-man raid on a back street Parisian joint and falls in love with one of the hookers he arrests.” The lead- ing actress recalled in a TV documen- tary: “I played a prostitute and Jack played a young gendarme who tried to rescue me from the street.” Jack (Lemmon) did not play a “gen- darme.” One French-English dictionary defines gendarme as a policeman “ in countryside and small towns. ” Another defines it as a “member of the state po- lice force,” approximately equal to a “police constable.” It is possible to speak of a Parisian po- liceman without dragging in “gen- darme.” GENDER and SEX. Gender is a term of grammar. It is the classification of certain words as masculine, feminine, or neuter. In English those words are nouns and pronouns, the great majority of them neuter, like table, song, it, its. Among masculine words are man, boy, he, his. Among feminine words: woman, girl, she, her. In English, gender for the most part is natural. That is, most words of mascu- line or feminine gender represent sexual, or at least human, qualities. But the word gender is not synonymous with sex. In various languages it often has nothing to do with sex—or with any- thing else. In the Romance languages, grammar 148 gendarme 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 148"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"arbitrarily decrees nouns to be masculine or feminine, regardless of any sexual qualities. Thus, in Spanish el día, the day, is masculine, while la noche, the night, is feminine. In French la plume, the pen, is feminine, while le crayon, the pencil, is masculine. Even in English, the feminine pro- nouns she and her are often applied to such neuter things as ships and coun- tries. His in a phrase like to each his own, while masculine in gender, is used in a neuter sense. In recent decades an increasingly pop- ular use of gender has been as a eu- phemism for sex, meaning the classification of human beings and ani- mals as male or female. It is not obvious why sex, in such an innocent sense, needs a euphemism. Thus, a magazine chart lists library visits by demographic categories, includ- ing “AGE . . . INCOME . . . EDUCA- TION” and “GENDER.” On another page, an essayist criticizes “double stan- dards that have the effect of . . . pitting race against race, gender against gen- der.” Sex, rather than “gender,” would be quite fitting in both instances and in the newspaper sentences below. Prosecutors and defense lawyers may not bar a potential juror from serving in a criminal trial solely be- cause of the person’s gender. . . . [Under a proposed bill] a man could sue a woman for a violent attack, ar- guing it was based on his gender. Not even an editor’s normal penchant for short words in headlines overcomes the squeamishness toward sex. The first news story was headed “Potential Jurors Can’t Be Barred Because of Gender, Court Rules.” While gender has increasingly usurped the role of sex in genteel use, the casual use of sex as a noun denoting coitus or any sexual activity has become more common. For instance, the mes- sage that “We had sexual intercourse” is more likely to take the form of the “slept together” euphemism or “We had sex.” Strictly speaking, all of us have sex all the time. It is either male or female. Genitive (possessive). See Double possessive; Gerund, 4; Possessive prob- lems; Pronouns, 1, 2, 9, 10A; Punctua- tion, 1. Germanisms.

Gerund or infinitive? 4. Pos- sessive with gerund. 1. Definition When the -ing form of a verb is used as a noun, it is called a gerund. It serves every function of a noun. It may be a subject (“ Laughing makes me happy”), a direct object of a verb (“Jane loves kissing ”), the object of a preposi- tion (“By oversleeping, John missed the plane”), or a subjective complement (“His goal was finding the missing link”). Many -ing words are not gerunds. “Reinforcements are coming. ” / “The senator delivered a stinging rebuke.” / “ Laughing hysterically, he could barely resume the broadcast.” In those exam- ples coming, stinging, or laughing is a present participle. It is a verb form that expresses present action (in relation to the tense of the finite verb) and can serve as an adjective. Do not confuse a gerund with a pre- sent participle. It appears that an editor did so in program notes for a recording: A music critic “reproached Beethoven for the absence of a great vocal fugue gerund 149 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 149"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"considered traditional in every musical, setting of a religious drama. . . .” A comma does not belong in musical set- ting but fits this sentence, in which set- ting does act as a present participle: “He strode inside, setting the statuette on the floor.” (A comma should follow “fugue.” See Punctuation, 3C. ) 2. Errors of omission One who uses a gerund carelessly and fails to indicate the subject of an action can create a dangler. The result may be an awkwardly ungrammatical sentence and worse: the gerund may link with a wrong part of its sentence and produce an unintended meaning. This sentence is typical: “The whales can be protected only by being ever vigi- lant.” It seems to be calling on the whales to take action. The trouble is that “being” is a dangling participle. Preced- ing it with our would make it a gerund and indicate the intended meaning. Although a similar grammatical error did not obscure the meaning of an edito- rial, it is not what the newspaper tradi- tionally considers fit to print: It costs only $ 500 to provide an ex- pectant mother with adequate prena- tal care. Yet treating a low-weight infant can cost $ 180 , 000 even before leaving the hospital. “Treating,” a gerund and the subject of “can cost,” seems to take over—sense- lessly—as the subject of “leaving” too because the writer failed to indicate any other subject. “Leaving” is a dangling participle. To precede it with a pronoun, “ its leaving,” thereby making it a gerund, would be a correction; it leaves would be better still. The final example in this section, quoted by Punch of England, originates in a column of personal items. Gram- matically the only subject is the “Muske- teers.” The result is hardly what the writer intended. Grateful thanks to the three Muske- teers who carried Mrs. Pride home af- ter breaking her leg on Wednesday. The magazine commented, “Least they could do.” See also Modifiers, 1. 3. Gerund or infinitive? A. Examples Some people who use our language lack a command of idiom. They do not always know whether a particular con- struction calls for an infinitive, that is, the basic form of a verb; or a gerund, that is, the -ing form used as a noun. The resulting errors are excusable when committed by foreigners who are unfamiliar with English. A Japanese- owned jewelry store displayed a sign that said, “PLEASE GET AN AP- POINTMENT BEFORE GO IN.” When advised that the sign could stand improvement, especially by inflection of the verb “GO,” the management re- placed it. The new sign said, “PLEASE MAKE AN APPOINTMENT BEFORE GOING THANK YOU.” Such errors are less tolerable when committed by an English-speaking per- son, particularly one whose regular job is to communicate information to the public. An example is provided by a news service: There were 299 rapes, assaults and murders last year on campuses of the UC system, which devotes a fraction of its $ 6 billion yearly budget to pro- tect students. [ See FRACTION. ] The verb devote does not go with an in- finitive, such as “protect.” Protecting would be right. The two made-up exam- ples below will help to explain. 150 gerund 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 150"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"• “The university devotes most of its budget to salaries, buildings, and protecting students.” That is, it appropriates funds for certain purposes; each purpose is a noun (“salaries, buildings”) or a gerund (“protecting students”). Here to introduces the ultimate recipients of the action. • “The university’s police try to protect students.” The verb try, unlike devote, can go with an infinitive: the police try to do something (“protect students”). This time to indicates the infinitive. Erroneous analogies may account for some misuses. A book says “the decision . . . contributed notably to re- dress the constitutional balance. . . .” The unidiomatic “contributed . . . to redress” parallels served to redress, which would be correct. “Contributed” can stand if the infinitive is changed to the gerund: “contributed . . . to redress- ing. . . . ” Here the to does not indicate an infinitive; rather it points to that which benefited from the action. There is no general rule, except that a writer or speaker needs to be secure in his knowledge of any verb’s properties before using the verb.

Lists It would be impractical to try to list all the many other words that could pose similar problems of idiom. Here are sixty such words: nouns, verbs, and ad- jectives.

Examples are the nouns chance ( of or to ) and intention ( of or to ), verbs fail ( at or to ) and think ( of or to ), and adjec- tives sorry ( about or to ) and sure ( of or to ). 4. Possessive with gerund Just as nearly every noun may be pos- sessed (“He took his suitcase ” / “They pledged their love ”), so may a gerund: “She was shocked at his winning the money.” His modifies the gerund win- ning. It would not be strictly correct to say “. . . at him winning the money.” Not “him” but his winning shocked her. A similar example: “Children’s drink- ing vexes the councilman.” Note the apostrophe -s. Children’s modifies the gerund drinking. “ Children drinking vexes . . .” is wrong, the grammarian H. W. Fowler would say: What would be the subject of the sentence, “Children”? But vexes is singular. Making it “vex” would be of no help. The children do not trouble the councilman; only their drink- ing does. Could the subject be “drink- ing”? That would leave “Children” hanging there without any grammatical purpose. Omitting the possessive produces a form that Fowler condemned for “rapidly corrupting English style”: a fused participle, “a compound notion” resulting from the fusion of a noun or a pronoun in the objective case and a par- ticiple. He did not invent the concept of possessive with gerund, which went back several centuries, but did introduce the name for the questionable form (with his brother in The King’s English, 1906 ) and publicize it (in his famous Dictionary of Modern English Usage, 1926 ). The four examples below come from a book of true adventure, an editorial, an article from a Hong Kong newspaper, and an ad for an aquarium respectively. Corrections are inserted in brackets. ...A search and rescue situa- tion . . . could end up in me [ my ] being charged half a million pounds. He blamed Democrats last year for Susan Smith [ Smith’s ] drowning her two young children in South Car- olina. This [Chinese protest to a U.S. visit by Taiwan’s leader] is despite Mr Lee [ Lee’s ] indicating he would not be travelling abroad for some time to come. See sharks without it [ its ] costing an arm and a leg. Sometimes the possessive form does not work. We look at three examples that are technically flawed according to the principles stated above. (Each fused participle is emphasized:) A. “He wouldn’t hear of that being pos- sible . . .” (Dickens). You would not say “that’s being possible.” The sen- tence is best let alone. B. “I hate the thought of any son of mine marrying badly” (Hardy). You would not say “son’s” or “mine’s.” Besides, as a colloquial sentence, in a novel, it is tolerable. C. “ This state’s metropolis undergoing chaos is an unhappy sight.” If said aloud, “metropolis’s” would sound like a plural. Anyway, how desirable are a double possessive and all those esses? The sentence needs rewriting. In two instances, Fowler’s own cure seems worse than the disease: He would “deny the possibility of anything’s hap- pening” and would not mind “ many’s having to go into lodgings.” Writers on grammar have generally accepted a possessive pronoun with a gerund ( my being charged ) or a proper noun with a gerund ( Lee’s indicating ) in 152 gerund 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 152"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"a simple sentence. But they have found numerous exceptions, particularly in complicated sentences. Some grammari- ans (not quoted here) have justified the fused participle as a valid alternative in any sentence. Not even Sir Ernest Gowers, the sym- pathetic reviser of Fowler’s dictionary, could accept the pure precept. He agreed that “upon your giving” was undoubt- edly more idiomatic than “upon you giv- ing.” But he found that a more complicated sentence could make a pos- sessive impossible, for example: “We have to account for the collision of two great fleets . . . ending in the total de- struction of one of them.” He would waive the possessive also when it was possible but “ungainly.” (“ Anything’s happening”?) In literature, the grammarian George O. Curme found, the possessive has been ( 1 ) most common when the gerund’s subject is a pronoun; ( 2 ) rendered useless by modifying phrases or clauses (“Have you heard of Smith, who used to be pitcher, being injured?”); and ( 3 ) avoided for an emphatic subject (“She was proud of him doing it”) or contrast- ing subjects (“We seem to think nothing of a boy smoking but resent a girl smok- ing”). The final example is drawn from a rel- atively recent book about words. Ironi- cally, the author is praising Fowler, who railed against just such usage: Too often a name is legendary without many people knowing about the person. Fowler would have insisted on people’s. You may decide for yourself whether it would be an improvement. ( See also LEGEND, LEGENDARY. ) GHOULISH. See FESTOON, FES- TOONED. GIRL. See GUY. GIVE AWAY and GIVEAWAY. A printed election poster attacked a local ballot proposition as “The $ 100 Mil- lion-a-Year Give Away!” From a techni- cal standpoint, it was in error. For one thing, “Give” and “Away” should have been united. Give away, in two words, is a verb phrase meaning ( 1 ) to present (some- thing) as a gift; ( 2 ) to disclose (informa- tion): “Don’t give away our secret”; or ( 3 ) to ceremonially transfer a bride from her family to her husband: “Mr. Green gave his daughter away.” Uniting the words yields the informal noun giveaway, which means ( 1 ) some- thing given away or the act of giving away: “Vote against the giveaway”; or ( 2 ) that which discloses: “His finger- prints were a giveaway.” A giveaway show is a quiz program, usually on tele- vision, in which prizes are given away.

Has, have, or had does not mix with “went.” Went is the past tense of the verb go. The past participle of go is gone. Therefore a correction of the first exam- ple is either “The drug activity went down . . .” (in the past tense) or “The drug activity has gone down . . .” (in the present perfect tense).

GOOD and WELL. A Polish leader was toasting the American president in Warsaw. A metropolitan newspaper in the United States quoted him, in part, this way: What is more, we were able to meet in a friendly atmosphere. And I believe we have felt well together. The defect can easily be forgiven if the Pole was speaking in English. It is more serious if he was speaking in Polish and this was an English translation. A correction: “we have felt good to- gether,” that is, happy, content, or opti- mistic. In the context of feeling, well usually pertains only to health. On rare occasions it pertains to touch or the abil- ity to feel things. “I feel well” means I suffer no sign of illness. ( Feel is not modified by well. Feel acts there as an intransitive verb, also as a linking verb: It links the subject, I, to the verb’s complement, the adjective well. Or, in the sentence “We felt good,” it links we to the adjective good. See FEEL. ) In the sense of health, “I feel good” is quite informal; “she’s not good” is di- alectal. One is well or feels well. A baseball umpire said, in an inter- view on a radio sports program, “We cover the games pretty good.” Change “good” to well. Here it means properly or skillfully. (In this context cover is modified by well. This time well is used as an adverb. Cover is a transitive verb. “Good,” not being an adverb, cannot modify a verb. Usually good is an adjec- tive, which modifies a noun: good boy; the food is good. ) Interviewed on a television “maga- zine,” a designer of military aircraft said about one of his planes, “It worked as good or better than we expected.” A partial correction: “It worked as well. . . . ” ( Well, an adverb, modifies worked, an intransitive verb.) A further correction: “as well as or better than we expected” or “as well as we expected or better. ” See AS, 3. An essayist on that program said later, referring to a supposed winner of two monetary prizes, “Mary’s doing pretty good.” She is doing well (adverb), not “good.” If she were performing charita- ble deeds, one could say “She is doing good. ” ( Good would be used as a noun. There would be no place for “pretty.”) Still later, a reporter on the same pro- gram correctly used both words in the same sentence: “Before he did well [be- came successful], he did good [per- formed altruistic acts].” GO OFF and GO ON. Occasionally the phrase go off is ambiguous. It can mean the same as go on— even though off and on are opposites, as anyone who has flipped an electric switch knows. Go off can have these contradictory meanings: ( 1 ) to take place (“The show went off as planned”) and ( 2 ) to discon- tinue or go away (“The show went off the air”).

A television newscaster announced, “Prison officials are proceeding as though the execution will go off.” Did he mean “as though the execu- tion will go on ” (or “ take place ”) or “as though the execution is off ” (or “will not take place )? Probably he meant the former, although the “prison officials” did not explain what good a Supreme Court review would do if the prisoner were dead. By the way, the newscaster said that the Supreme Court had issued a “writ of certiori.” He left out a syllable. It is cer- tiorari (sir-she-a-RARE-ee), an order from a higher court to a lower, request- ing the records of a case for review. GRAFFITI and GRAFFITO. Graf- fiti is a plural word. It denotes crude in- scriptions, drawings, or scrawlings, often on walls, meant to be seen by the public. One such marking is a graffito. The two quotations are from a news agency’s dispatch and an editorial re- spectively: Stylized graffiti was even scrawled on a sign—the “z” on the Hollywood Freezway ice cream parlor—for a hint of hometown believability. The city of Dublin is discussing a five-day graffiti-removal program on the theory that the longer graffiti re- mains, the more publicity it gives the gang that did it. Both sample sentences are ungrammati- cal in their mixing of plural and singular. The first sentence refers to only one marking, so change “Stylized graffiti was” to “ A stylized graffito was.” If there had been two or more markings, graffiti were would be correct. A correc- tion of the second sentence is “The longer graffiti remain, the more publicity they give the gangs that make them. ” Originating in the Greek graphein, to write, graffito and graffiti come to us from Italian. They used to have archeo- logical and, later, political connotations. Now the words, more commonly graf- fiti, popularly connote the defacing of structures and vehicles by callow van- dals. GRAZE. A restaurant reviewer tells readers: “Graze on skewers of grilled food—the list spans 27 —in this noisy yet convivial yakitori bar.” Animals such as cows and horses graze. To graze (verb, intransitive) is to feed on growing grasses and similar plants. The verb came from the Old En- glish grasian, from graes, meaning grass. Sometimes graze is humorously ap- plied to the eating of raw, leafy vegeta- bles. Applying it to the eating of barbecued meat, however, is far-fetched. Farmers and ranchers use graze (verb, transitive) in a variety of ways: to feed on (a type of herbage or the herbage of a particular pasture), to put (animals) out to feed, to tend (feeding animals), and so on. Graze (verb, transitive and intransi- tive) means also to scrape, rub, or touch lightly in passing. “The bullet grazed his skin”). The way bees or butterflies skim along the grass of a field could conceiv- ably have suggested this sense. GREAT. This adjective, of Old En- glish lineage, primarily expresses magni- tude: being large in size, area, amount, number, importance, or other attributes. The Great Lakes and the Great Plains are aptly named. That traditional sense of great can conflict with a newer, informal sense. Talking about cars, a syndicated radio host asked, “Why are prices so great?”—leading some of his audience to assume that prices were high. His own answer was that foreign competition had caused prices to be low. They were “great”—that is, very good—for the consumer. great 155 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 155"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"GRIEVOUS, GRIEVOUSLY. A mistake that some speakers make in uttering grievous and grievously is in- serting an extra syllable. The words are pronounced GREE-vuss(-lee), not “GREE-vee-uss(-lee).” Sometimes they are misspelled “griev i ous(ly),” with an extra “i.” A newscaster on a radio network said a bill to ban certain abortions made an exception “to save the life of the mother and to prevent grievious harm to her.” He got grievous wrong. A congressman said on television, concerning the issuance of rubber checks by colleagues, “There are some people here who may have been griev i ously wounded.” Grievously. Grievous (adjective) means ( 1 ) serious or grave; or ( 2 ) causing or expressing grief. It has two syllables, not three. Grievously (adverb) means ( 1 ) seri- ously or gravely; or ( 2 ) in a way that causes or expresses grief. It has three syl- lables, not four. GRISLY, GRIZZLY, and GRIZ- ZLED. 1. GRISLY and GRIZZLY. 2. GRIZZLED. 1. GRISLY and GRIZZLY While pronounced the same (GRIZ- lee), these two adjectives have different meanings and histories. A newspaper ad mixed the words up. Warning against selling a house without an agent, it said, “The stories are grizzly.” A frightening story is grisly. (It could possibly be a “grizzly” story if it dealt with bears.) Grisly (from the Old English grislic, terrifying) means gruesome, horrifying, or terrifying. Grizzly (from the Old French gris, gray) means gray or grayish. The grizzly bear was named for its grayish coloring, not for its fearfulness. The misspelling or misuse of grisly may be less frequent than its unnecessary use. Technically it was not used wrong in the lead sentence of a news story, quoted here: A family member was being held Friday for suspicion of murder in the wake of a grisly stabbing that left four other family members dead. . . . What fatal stabbing is not “grisly”? 2. GRIZZLED Writing in a magazine about the frus- trations of his job, a news reporter com- plained that he had become “a cynic” and “a curmudgeon.” One paragraph said: Another sign I’m become more grizzled, I suppose, is I used to call my wife excitedly to tell her I’m on a breaking story. Now I call and say, “Damn it, I can’t get away.” If he thought that grizzled meant any- thing like cynical or ill-tempered, he was mistaken. Grizzled (adjective) means gray or streaked with gray, or gray- headed. A picture of the reporter showed a rather young man with an abundance of dark hair. (The sentence is otherwise defective. “Another sign . . . is” heralds a noun or nounal phrase, such as “my re- action to a breaking story.” Instead, we get the clause “I used to call my wife ex- citedly. . . .”) Grizzled is related to the verb grizzle, meaning (transitive) to make gray or (in- transitive) to become gray. In British En- glish, grizzle can mean to worry or fret. GROUP OF. See Collective nouns. GROW. The farmers grow artichokes. Hilda grows kumquats. Wilbur grew a beard. As a transitive verb, grow means cultivate or raise (a plant or crop) or cause (something natural) to arise.

So was the headline “Netanyahu promises to grow West Bank settlements.” A better verb was in the story, which said he would build there. Other usable verbs: enlarge, expand. A financial company boasts of “help- ing to grow the future of America.” Per- haps people could brighten or insure or secure its future, but the future does not “grow.” Guilt and innocence. 1. Civil vs. criminal. 2. Guilty vs. not guilty. 3. In- nocence presumed. 4. Pleas and charges. 5. Some words to watch. 1. Civil vs. criminal The difference between civil and crim- inal cases escapes some people who are supposed to inform others about such matters. Prop. 51 , the only initiative on the ballot, would change court rulings that now require someone who is par- tially responsible for an accident to pay all the victim’s damages if the other guilty parties have no money. That statement confuses civil and crimi- nal law. The proposition (on the Califor- nia ballot) that the news story cites deals wholly with civil actions. Nobody is found “guilty” in civil trials, which mainly settle lawsuits in private disputes. Guilt is a concept in criminal prosecu- tions, which are meant to enforce public laws by bringing their violators to jus- tice. The newspaper writer properly used responsible but quickly traded it for an incorrect adjective. An announcer invited television view- ers to “Join Judge Wapner in his struggle to separate the guilty from the inno- cent.” The program being promoted was “The People’s Court,” an unofficial imi- tation of a small claims court and strictly civil. A small claims judge does not “sep- arate the guilty from the innocent” but settles disputes about modest amounts of money and property. A network newscaster announced: “A jury has found Carroll O’Connor not guilty of slander. . . .” He was not re- sponsible for it. The trial was civil. Ver- dicts of “guilty” and “not guilty” were not options. 2. Guilty vs. not guilty Under the American system of justice, nobody needs to prove himself innocent. Unless convicted, a person accused of a crime is presumed to be innocent. The prosecution has the burden of proving him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If he is not found guilty, the verdict must be not guilty. The latter is no synonym for “innocent” but means that the prose- cution has failed to prove the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. There is no other verdict. President Clinton showed misunder- standing of that legal principle when he said, “Some of these [aliens] are found guilty and some innocent of the crimes with which they are charged.” He may have got the idea from news items like the following. In an ironic turn of court proce- dure, a young man pleaded guilty Tuesday to a drug-trafficking charge in the same courtroom where jurors in 1988 found him innocent of murder- ing his mother. Three former candidates for Sweetwa- ter County public offices were found guilty and one was found innocent of failing to file campaign financial re- ports in time. guilt and innocence 157 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 157"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Members of the jury had said they found the former automaker innocent because they felt government agents had lured him into illegal activity. Nobody is found “innocent” in Ameri- can courts. Nor is there such a plea—ex- cept in the news media: Marine in Spying Case Enters Plea of Innocent Suspect pleads innocent in deadly shooting spree Every “innocent” should be not guilty. Now let us explain the reason for the distortion. A hoary newspaper superstition has it that if anyone ever is reported to be “not guilty,” terrible things will happen: Maybe the “not” will disappear or the t in “not” will change to a w, the person on trial will sue, and the paper will go out of business. The odds against such a procession of events must be huge. The news media should consider whether the perpetua- tion of that superstition is worth the dis- torted picture of our judicial system that it fosters. (As for the incident reported in the first sample: was it “an ironic turn of court procedure” or “an ironic turn of events ” or not very ironic at all? See IRONY, IRONIC, IRONICALLY. ) What is worse than using an imprecise term is changing the term in mid sen- tence. B—— was found innocent of invol- untary manslaughter in the deaths of two other patients and not guilty of five counts of dereliction of duty. Some readers may have wondered about the difference between being found “in- nocent” and being found “not guilty.” 3. Innocence presumed The presumption of innocence is a principle that some journalists have yet to learn. A criminal charge is far from a conviction. A suspicion is further re- moved yet. In the last 18 months, serious damage has been done to national security by convicted or suspected spies in the CIA, the NSA, the Navy’s antisubma- rine warfare program and Navy com- munications and Middle East intelligence operations. Lumping together as “spies” both those who have been convicted in court of spy- ing and those who have merely been sus- pected of spying, the writers (the story has two by-lines) in effect find them all guilty and declare that all have done “se- rious damage . . . to national security.” (Style fares no better than substance in that passage. The listed items are jum- bled. There appear to be five, but it is hard to tell. Inadequate punctuation and perhaps an unnecessary “and” befog the series. See Series errors, 7. ) 4. Pleas and charges Two additional points are illustrated by each of these two samples (each the lead paragraph of a fourteen-paragraph news story): A former soldier from Pearl was sentenced to 30 years in prison Mon- day after pleading guilty to kidnap- ping a Jackson teenager and shooting at a police officer who tried to arrest him. Michael D—— . . . pleaded guilty yesterday to having engaged in bogus stock transactions with a British bro- ker to evade Federal laws requiring brokers to maintain minimum amounts of capital. 158 guilt and innocence 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 158"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"First, one does not plead to a crime. One pleads to a charge of a crime or a count of an indictment. Second, in any criminal proceeding, someone is accused of violating the law. Which law? Neither article tells us ex- actly. The first alludes to two charges (in stating the penalty for “kidnapping” and “assault”). The second refers to “Federal laws” without specifying them. A sum- mary of the charge might be something like “violation of the Securities and Ex- change Act by failing to maintain ade- quate net capital and by falsifying records.” Another news story says, “He has been charged with setting a dynamite bomb that caused extensive structural damage” to an abortion clinic (identified by name and address). That is typical; the story details what the arrested man is supposed to have done but not what law he is charged with having broken. A news service report tells about a po- lice chief who “was arrested for allegedly taking cocaine from the police depart- ment evidence room to support his 5 - year-old addiction.” The sixteenth and last paragraph says, “If convicted” the chief “could face more than 20 years in prison.” If convicted of what crime? The report fails to say. A possible charge might be “unlawful possession of co- caine,” but a reader must guess. 5. Some words to watch A possessive pronoun can be incrimi- nating, as in the sentence “Doaks has de- nied his guilt.” The pronoun “his” juxtaposed with “guilt” seems to imply that the man is guilty. (Of course, “her” or “their” would have the same effect.) Conversely, “Doaks proclaims his inno- cence” displays an apparent bias in his favor. An impartial version is Doaks has denied the charge or Doaks insists that he is innocent. A network television reporter identi- fied a man who had not been arrested but who was being investigated in con- nection with a bombing in a park. The reporter said, “J—— continues to deny his guilt.” It would have been far better to say, “He denies any involvement” or “He says he had nothing to do with the bombing” and to leave out the name as long as the man was not charged with a crime. In the end, he was exonerated and compensated by news companies for slander and libel. The preposition for can appear preju- dicial in a context like this: “Doaks was arrested for robbing the First National Bank on May 1 .” The “for” juxtaposed with “robbing” links him to the crime. This is impartial: Doaks was arrested on a charge of bank robbery. The police al- lege . . . (or an indictment alleges . . . ). Some news media justifiably forbid any combination of for and a legal charge or complaint. “Police said” and “police reported” are two of the most common phrases in crime reporting. A multitude of misstate- ments have followed. Such attributions do not shield news media against claims of defamation, particularly if no formal charges have been filed.

Guy became a noun for an odd-looking or strangely dressed man, also a verb meaning to jeer at or ridicule. In the United States it began to be used in the nineteenth century as a slang synonym for chap, fellow, or man.

We know why. It’s the same logic that says women look sexy and cute in a man’s shirt, but did you ever try your silk blouse on your husband and send him to the deli? It’s the same mentality that holds that anything male is worthy (and to be aspired toward) and any- thing female is trivial. Maybe. Or perhaps some women turned to the male term because it was more terse and colloquial than ladies or women and they perceived girl ( s ) and its colloquial variation, gal ( s ), as taboo by feminist rules.

But “a half a” is never right. A restaurant review said a shrimp plate contained a garnish of shredded cabbage and carrots “and a half a sliced strawberry.” The “a” before “half” was superfluous. Better: “and half a sliced strawberry.” Half is part of some terms, like a half brother or a half-life. You do not nor- mally speak of “half a brother” or “half a life.” Nor do you put half immediately before an adjective (as in “a half-sliced strawberry”) unless half applies to the adjective (“sliced”). Either half a dollar or a half-dollar is correct; either half an hour or a half- hour; either half a portion or a half- portion. When half adjoins a noun, the use or nonuse of a hyphen is often a matter of personal preference. Some terms are usually hyphenated, some usually unhy- phenated; dictionaries differ on others. 2.

Hardy means able to resist hardship, robust (“Astronauts must be hardy souls”), or, said of garden plants, able to get through the winter without special care. It is used in error here: Cooler weather and football season make a perfect time for hardy food. Hearty is closer to the mark. In the con- text of food, it means ample, nourishing, and satisfying (“a hearty dinner”) or re- quiring plenty of food (“a hearty ap- petite”). Food aside, it can mean cordial, genial (“a hearty greeting”). The two words have different ances- tries. Hardy is traced to the Old High German hartjan, to make hard. Hearty is composed of heart, from the Old English heorte, plus the common suffix -y. The sample sentence led an article on condiments in the food section of a large newspaper. Nothing more was said about football, and just how it was perti- nent is not obvious. HAREBRAINED. To be harebrained (adjective) is to have or reflect the brains of a hare (e.g., “a harebrained idea”). Some people mistakenly spell it “hair- brained.” Webster’s Third Dictionary le- gitimates the misspelling, making it an entry. One who displays no more intelli- gence than that long-eared animal can be called a harebrain (noun). Hare-brained and hare-brain are op- tional spellings. HAVE, HAS, HAD. 1. Ambiguity. 2.

How do we in- terpret have in the following sentence of a radio broadcast? Half the mothers who have abused children were abused themselves as children. That “have” can be a synonym for are parents of (if “abused,” a past participle, is construed as an adjective modifying “children”). However, “have abused” can be construed as a verb phrase, as in the sentence “You have abused your power.” (There have functions as an auxiliary verb, abused as a main verb, in the present perfect tense.)

Changing the sec- ond “had” to held or possessed or could produce would have eliminated the am- biguity. (Splitting that unwieldy sentence into two sentences also would have aided comprehension. The second sen- tence: “He said he held falsified time cards to support his argument.”) The sense of the sample below is eas- ier to conjecture than the two previous samples, yet the sentence has faults. It deals with the detention of a Dutch visi- tor with AIDS. Mr. Verhoef, who is 31 years old, was detained Sunday after Customs officials learned he has acquired im- mune deficiency syndrome when he stopped over at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. Because “has” and “acquired” adjoin, they tend to form a verb phrase, as in the sentence She has acquired money. One who knew that AIDS stood for acquired immune deficiency syndrome could backtrack and reinterpret “has” as de- noting possession. (Those misinterpret- ing the sentence might be fooled further by the placement of the phrase “when he stopped over at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport,” which could make it appear that the visitor acquired the disease when he stopped over at the airport. See Modifiers, 3. The tense would be wrong, but the tense is ques- tionable however the sentence is inter- preted: “learned [past] he has [present] . . .”? See Tense, 1, 2. ) Here is one way to rephrase the sentence (omit- ting one phrase): Mr. Verhoef was detained Sunday when he stopped over at the Min- neapolis-St. Paul International Air- port and Customs officials learned that he suffered from acquired im- mune deficiency syndrome. (The phrase “who is 31 years old” was irrelevant to the essential message of the sentence. One could wonder what the age had to do with the detention. A bet- ter location for that phrase, or for just the number 31, was four paragraphs ear- lier in the story, when the man was iden- tified.) See also TENSE, 5, concerning the perfect tenses, which use have, has, or had as an auxiliary verb. 2. Corruption Following the auxiliary verb could, may, might, must, should, or would, sometimes the have is wrongly replaced by “of”; for instance, “I could of gone fishing” and “They would of beaten us” (in place of have gone and have beaten ). The misuser may be confusing “of” with the contracted have, as in could’ve and would’ve, which is acceptable in collo- quial speech. In another corruption, the have turns into an “a” attached to a helping verb: “Sheila shoulda come” and “Monty musta seen it” (instead of should have come and must have seen ). 3.

The subjects do not cause the action; it is thrust upon them. The passive use of the verb have is not new; it is found in the writings of Shake- speare and Dickens. An old Webster’s Dictionary gave as one definition of have (verb, transitive) “to suffer or experience from an exterior source.” Its example was “he had his leg broken.” Sentences like that and “He broke his leg” have drawn ridicule from pedagogues, news- paper editors, and some grammarians. A critic deplored such use of have as a “counterfeit” of the causative have, more feeble than the true passive. Among “depraved” examples: “The Newark team . . . had six . . . games rained out last spring.” The suggested correction: “Six . . . were rained out”— scant improvement. The passive have has some reputable defenders. One found the meanings clear and the objec- tions erroneous and pedantic. Another called the critics “lint pickers” but fa- vored the rewriting of any ludicrous sen- tences. A sentence like this does demand rewriting: “While she had her hair done, she had her car smashed by a truck.” The second had is absurd; although it is supposed to have a different meaning, it parallels the first had. 4. With TO Two sentences, from a folder issued by a hospital and from an essay by a po- litical scientist, each misuse to. (In addi- tion, both err in their pronouns.) Every patient receiving general anes- thesia or medication must have a re- sponsible adult to accompany them home. He [President Jefferson] wished, he said, to have Congress, who “exclu- sively” had the power, to consider whether it would not be well to au- thorize measures of offense. In the first sentence, omit “to.” In the second sentence, omit the second “to.” When have is causative—when you have someone do something—“to” does not follow idiomatically. “I’ll have [or “I had ”] the plumber fix the sink”—not “to fix.” / “Have an adult accompany him home.” / “Have Congress authorize measures of offense.” (The other errors: [ 1 ] referring to a singular subject, “Every patient,” with a plural pronoun, “them”; and [ 2 ] repre- senting a thing, “Congress,” by “who.” See Pronouns, 2; WHO, THAT, and WHICH, 1. ) Have may go with to in other con- texts. “I have a key to get inside” is cor- rect. There have indicates possession and to indicates purpose. And have to is a proper phrase indicating obligation or necessity: “I have to [or “She has to ”] go home.” See also TO. HAVOC.

Hawaii seems to be a foreign country to the copy editor who wrote a headline reading “Amfac [a conglomer- ate] says ‘aloha’ to U.S. divisions to fo- cus on Hawaii” and a caption reading “Amfac will shed domestic units to stay in Hawaii.” Some people remain unaware that Hawaii has been the fiftieth U.S. state since 1959 , the Aloha State. ( Aloha is Hawaiian for goodbye, hello, or love. ) A former kingdom, it was annexed by the United States in 1898 and became a U.S. territory in 1900 . 164 havoc 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 164"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"It is composed of the Hawaiian Is- lands, once called the Sandwich Islands, a chain some 2 , 000 miles southwest of San Francisco. Hawaii is the most southerly state of the United States. It is not the most westerly; Alaska is. Hawaii is properly pronounced Ha- WHY-ee—never Ha-WHY-uh, which some dictionaries condone; and never Ha-VIE-ee, which some people mistak- enly believe is authentic. Its main islands are Hawaii; Kauai (cow-EYE); Maui (MAO-wee); and Oahu (owe-AH-who), on which the capital city, Honolulu (ha- no-LOO-loo), is situated. A person lives in Hawaii, if you are re- ferring to the State of Hawaii. One could live on Hawaii, i.e., on what is locally known as “the Big Island,” the largest of the Hawaiian Islands in area, but it is better to specify “the Island of Hawaii” to avoid confusion. Hawaii residents never call themselves “Hawaiians” unless they are descen- dants of the original Hawaiians, mem- bers of the Polynesian race. (“Race” is not a common word there; the people prefer “nationality.”) Few pure Hawai- ians survive, but many islanders are con- sidered “part Hawaiian.” To call anyone else a “Hawaiian” is to betray one’s un- familiarity with the islands. The mainland’s mass media seem in- capable of dealing with Hawaii without sticking in the “paradise” cliché. Articles in two newspapers and a magazine were typically headed “Hawaii: Pint-size par- adise” / “Debate in Paradise—Who’s Hawaiian” / “Hawaii: Telecommuting from Paradise.” The use of that word to describe the Hawaiian Islands goes back at least to 1888 , when a magazine called Paradise of the Pacific was founded in Honolulu. (It would last seventy-eight years.) Par- adise means the kingdom of heaven, the abode of eternal bliss; and understand- ably that scenic, flowery, subtropical kingdom suggested it to some. Notwithstanding the one-sided pic- ture presented in travel promotions, Hawaii residents complain of many of the same problems that beset other Americans: problems concerning the en- vironment, health, the law, living costs, population pressures, and so on. Then there are some distinctive troubles. A volcanic eruption on one of the is- lands was the subject of TV news on the mainland. An anchor woman said, “There is more trouble in paradise tonight. Another home went up in flames on the Island of Hawaii.” Isn’t it odd that a land where lava consumes houses should remind her of heaven and not of the other place? HEAD ON and HEAD-ON. See Joining of words; Punctuation, 4D. HEADQUARTERS. Headquarters, meaning a center of operations, usually is treated as a plural noun. Below it is construed as singular. But already now, even while the Civic Forum searched for a headquar- ters and Mr. Adamec looked for new ministers, the faint outlines of the fu- ture were taking shape. . . . The article “a” is not necessary. Yet few would flatly declare a singular construc- tion of headquarters to be incorrect. What is more disputable is using the word, sans s, as a verb. Nine-tenths of The American Heritage Dictionary us- age panel rejected “The European corre- spondent will headquarter in Paris” and “The magazine has headquartered him in a building that houses many foreign journalists.” The use of the past partici- ple has become a fairly common collo- quialism, especially in the passive (“is headquartered”).

The difference The two adjectives are not synonyms. The -al makes a difference. An event that is famous or important in history—such as Columbus’s discov- ery in 1492 or the first trip to the moon, in 1969 —may be called historic. Some- times the word is used more loosely to describe a contemporary event that one thinks or hopes will prove historic. That which pertains to the topic of history or contributes to the record of history—a society, a document, etc.—is historical. So is a book, a show, etc. based on historic events. Dickens’s story of the French Revolution, A Tale of Two Cities, is a historical novel. However, in referring to the academic subject, history usually serves as an adjective: a history teacher, course, or textbook. When an indefinite article precedes ei- ther word, it is usually a, as in “a historic voyage” or “a historical movie.” See also A and AN. 2. HISTORIC news? The word historic is used freely in the press. There it often pertains, not to an event of long ago, but to a current event, usually one that has been anticipated. A main headline proclaimed a “His- toric Global Trade Pact.” Another, in a second newspaper, announced: “His- toric anti-crime bill passed by the Sen- ate.” Did the editors possess a deep knowledge or sense of history? Or was it just their way of letting readers know that the issues those events resolved—af- ter prolonged and prominent debate— were important? The historical importance of a “his- toric” current event is open to argument. This was broadcast: “NASA today called off an historic space mission.” To apply “historic” to something that does not even happen may be going too far. HOBSON’S CHOICE. A Hobson’s choice is a take-it-or-leave-it offer. It is the choice of taking either that which is offered or nothing at all. All three quota- tions misuse the term. [A news magazine:] King Fahd . . . faced a Hobson’s choice: he could go it alone, leaving his small and scat- tered army to answer Iraq’s battle- hardened troops, or he could call in the U.S. and lay bare his ties. [A talk-show host on the choice be- tween a child and a career:] A lot of women have to make that decision and it’s like a Hobson’s choice, isn’t it? [A poll taker, as quoted in a newspa- per:] “Both candidates appear to be highly flawed. . . . For Democrats, it’s a real Hobson’s choice.” Each statement describes a dilemma, not a “Hobson’s choice.” The expression is said to have origi- nated in the practice of Thomas Hobson, of Cambridge, England, who died in 1631 . He let horses and required each customer to take the horse nearest the stable door or none. See also DILEMMA. HOLD. Hey, voters, get ahold of yourselves Get what?

The first para- graph of an article deals with “homes”; the second, with “houses.” Then “homes” are mentioned several times more. Low mortgage interest rates and a smaller supply of homes for sale in the last six months helped break what had been a free fall in Alameda County home prices. Houses in a few neighborhoods even increased in values since the last survey. . . . Livermore has a stock of relatively smaller and older three-bedroom homes [and so on]. What is the difference? Not much to the writer, who has largely accepted the word pushed by real estate people (al- though the second paragraph may indi- cate a twinge of journalistic conscience). They prefer to call a residential house for sale a “home,” bare and unoccupied though it may be, thereby helping to convey the notion that they sell security, comfort, happiness, and the like. To Edgar A. Guest, there was a good deal of difference between the two words. He wrote in his poem Home: “It takes a heap o’ livin’ in a house t’ make it home.” People have made their homes in other than houses— in caves, cliff dwellings, hogans, huts, igloos, lake dwellings, lean-tos, pueblos, tepees, wickiups, wigwams, yurts, and of course apartments. On the other hand, a house in which nobody lives is nobody’s home. On national television one saw flames consuming houses in Glendale, Califor- nia. Firemen in helicopters dropped chemicals on what a voice called “the homes.” They were now hardly “homes.” Homographs and homonyms. See Homophones. HOMOPHOBIA. The Greek pho- bos, a fear, is the origin of the noun pho- bia, a morbid, or unhealthy, fear; an intense, persistent, irrational dread of a thing, being, or situation. The suffix -phobia is part of many words that indi- cate types of morbid fear, such as acro- phobia, fear of heights; agoraphobia, fear of being in a public place; and claus- trophobia, fear of being in a confined place. A dictionary of psychology defines homophobia as ( 1 ) “A morbid fear of homosexuality” and ( 2 ) “A morbid fear of mankind.” (The combining form homo- is from the Greek word homos, meaning same; while Homo, the genus including mankind, is from the Latin homo, meaning man.) An encyclopedia of phobias defines homophobia as “Fear of homosexuality or becoming a homo- sexual.” An approximate antonym is heterophobia, “Fear of the opposite sex. . . .” The common element in all the defini- tions is fear, yet that element is often lacking in the current use of the word, as in an editorial: Who cares who Ellen is sleeping with? . . . Those rock-ribbed Ameri- cans who’d sooner puke than applaud Ellen’s lesbianhood. . . . This show . . . will just harden their homophobia to tensile strength. 168 hold up, holdup, hold-up 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 168"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"When the meaning is a dislike of homo- sexuals or opposition to homosexual practices and there is no fear, let alone phobia, it is better to explain what is meant than to miss the mark with homo- phobia. If a lone noun is needed, a possi- bility is antihomosexuality (adjective antihomosexual ); another, which would fit the editorial, is simply hatred. Homophones. The English language contains an abundance of words (or lin- guistic units) that are pronounced or spelled like other words but have differ- ent meanings. Let us define three such categories: • Homographs, words that are spelled alike but pronounced differently (e.g., wind, moving air; and wind, to coil or turn). • Homonyms, words that are spelled and pronounced alike (e.g., bear, an animal; and bear, to carry or withstand). • Homophones, words that are spelled differently but pronounced alike. In the following examples, writers have absent-mindedly replaced correct words with their homophones. According to a news item, an editor “said he hoped the former aide to Richard Nixon would right an after- word” for a book by Nixon. Plainly write (to compose sentences) was con- fused with “right” (which also can be a verb, e.g., to right a wrong). A famed lexicographer wrote in a let- ter that he had sunk “waste deep” in snow in the Alps. He meant waist (the narrow part of the torso), not “waste” (refuse or an act of wasting). Under a proposal by the president, “overall Federal spending would be held constant accept for inflation.” Someone at a newspaper confused except (a preposition meaning other than) with “accept” (a verb meaning to take some- thing offered). The pronunciations differ slightly. An op-ed piece about telephone solici- tors said “their ought to be a law.” Make it there (the adverb), not “their” (the possessive pronoun). Sometimes they’re, the contraction of they are, is confused with one or the other. A movie review said “he crawls into a construction sight. . . .” Site (a place) would be right, not “sight” (a view). A third word that sounds the same is cite, to quote, refer to, or officially summon or mention. Forty other groups of homophones are listed below in boldface, a pair or triplet in each paragraph. They are ar- ranged alphabetically and briefly de- fined, many with illustrations of use. Additional homophones are dealt with in other entries, listed after this list. See also Confusing pairs.

Senator and Mrs. Richard Roe is right. “Hon. and Mrs. Richard Roe,” as used sometimes, deprives him of his title. Honorable is an adjective only, liter- ally meaning characterized by, possess- ing, or worthy of honor. “Brutus is an honorable man.” ( See also REV- EREND. ) The related adverb is honor- ably. “You performed honorably.” 2. HONORARY; HONORARIUM Usually honorary (adjective) describes either ( 1 ) a title or position granted as an honor with no payment, duties, or privi- leges, as honorary chairman, or ( 2 ) something else given solely as an honor without any actual utility, such as an honorary degree conferred by an educa- tional institution (sometimes to honor the institution more than the official honoree). Honorary originally meant of honor or conferring honor, the word’s meaning in Latin; e.g., “The simple crown of olive, an honorary reward” (in ancient Greece). A word that sounds similar but has a much different meaning is honorarium (noun), a voluntary payment to a profes- sional person for special services when no fee is set or legally required. 3. HONORED IN THE BREACH A custom or rule that is more honored in the breach than in the observance is one for which a person deserves more honor for breaking than for observing. A book on English usage says a cer- tain grammatical rule “is honored now more in the breach than in the obser- vance.” The intended meaning is that the rule is broken more often than it is kept. This illustrates a common misapplica- tion of the saying. The source is Shakespeare’s Hamlet, in which Hamlet, the Prince of Den- mark, says, “it is a custom / More honor’d in the breach than the obser- vance.” The reference is to the custom of wassail, revelry with spirituous toasts to health. ( See also Prepositions, 4, end.) 4. TIME-HONORED “Negative campaigning is a time- honored tradition in this country,” a net- work broadcaster said. A story that followed described political mud- slinging since the days of Jefferson, tend- ing to disparage it. Perhaps he meant “time-honored” as irony. The practice of defaming one’s po- litical opponents is commonly dishon- ored, not honored. To honor (verb, transitive) something or someone is to treat it or him with honor (noun): es- teem, regard, respect, or reverence. To dishonor something is to insult it or treat it with disrespect, as the broadcaster did to mud-slinging. Anyway, “time-honored tradition” was redundant. One dictionary’s defini- tion of tradition is “A time-honored practice. . . .” Time-honored means hon- ored, observed, or carried on because of antiquity or long continuation. HOPEFULLY. Nobody denies that the adverb hopefully can mean in a hopeful manner, showing hope, feeling hope, or with hope. “Striding hopefully to the betting window, I slapped down my twenty-dollar bill.” However, a controversy goes on be- tween those who would restrict the word to its primary meaning and those who would allow it to serve as a synonym for “I hope” / “let us hope” / “it is hoped” / or “we can hope.” Such use has become increasingly popular since the sixties. A radio newscaster tells of a standstill 172 hopefully 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 172"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"at the airport and adds, “The fog is lift- ing and hopefully things will be return- ing to normal.” The “things” are not doing any hoping. Then who is? The newscaster is, but she is not in the sen- tence. Her “hopefully” modifies noth- ing. It just dangles there. Hopefully may eventually be admitted to the elite society of absolute construc- tions, words and phrases that are per- mitted to dangle; but its time has not yet arrived. See Modifiers, 1D. HOUSE. See HOME and HOUSE. HOW. How (adverb) means in what manner or way (“How did the accident happen?”), by what means (“I wonder how he does that trick”), in what condi- tion (“Tell me how she is”), or to what amount, degree, extent, etc. (“How ex- pensive and how good a car do you want?”). It can be used as an intensive or as part of an exclamation (“How sweet!”) and colloquially it can amount to why? (“How so?”) One thing it is not, at least in standard usage, is a substitute for that. Such use of “how,” or sometimes the phrase “as how,” is highly informal or regional. So is the phrase “being as how” or “seeing as how” in place of because or inasmuch as. An urban daily newspaper devoted a front-page article to a family’s display of wooden sheep on a hillside. It has something to do with how K—— once kept live sheep there and how he and his wife, J——, are ex- pecting their second child. The article says nothing about the man- ner in which he kept live sheep (e.g., loose on a hillside, watched by a shep- herd) and nothing about the manner in which the couple are expecting their child (e.g., cheerfully with monthly cele- brations).

Some people use the two words inter- changeably, encouraged by some dictio- naries. That is how a certain book on English usage uses the words (emphases added): Among the various other theories concerning the alphabet are the hy- potheses that the alphabet was brought by the Philistines from Crete to Palestine, that the various ancient scripts of the Mediterranean countries developed from prehistoric geometric symbols [etc.]. . . . Another hypothe- sis, the Ugaritic theory, evolved after an epoch-making discovery. . . . Among “theories” are several “hypothe- ses”? Another “hypothesis” is a “the- ory”? The writers seem more intent on avoiding repetition of a word than avoiding confusion among readers. Those who want to be precise or sci- entific distinguish between the two words in this way: A hypothesis is much more tentative. It has much less evidence to support it or no evidence at all. It is an unproven proposition, supposition, or plain guess that is accepted tentatively to explain some facts or to serve as the basis for study, investigation, or experimentation. A theory is bolstered by a good deal of evidence and usually is more elaborate. hypothesis and theory 173 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 173"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"It is a system of principles to explain cer- tain phenomena that have been ob- served; the principles have been at least partially verified.

Example: [From a lecture:] Mind-body medi- cine is an idea whose time has come. Or, put in the past: [From a book:] But book clubs were an idea whose time had come. It amounts to a fancy way of saying that the idea is or was popular. (For those taking the cliché literally, questions arise: Does every idea, even a trivial one, have a “time”? What determines it? What about conflicting ideas, wrong ideas, bad ideas?) In 1943 a circular from The Nation attributed this sentence to Victor Hugo’s diary: “There is one thing stronger than all the armies in the world; and that is an idea whose time has come.” Its origin was probably Histoire d’un crime by Hugo: “An invasion of armies can be re- sisted; an invasion of ideas cannot.” (Source: The Home Book of Quota- tions. ) Some still combine Hugo’s thought about the invincibility of ideas with the timeliness notion. In an article about the Romanian revolution of 1989 , a profes- sor of political science wrote: The luminous courage of [the Rev. Laszlo] Tokes and his supporters proved, yet again, that no force can resist an idea whose time has come. “idea whose time has come” 175 I 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 175"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"The particular idea discussed was that of political freedom.

Modifiers An author describes a visit to a remote village in Niger, Africa. Looking at the young men, all of pure blood, I noticed their faces were in- deed somewhat identical. “. . . Their faces were indeed similar ” would make more sense. “Somewhat identical” is impossible. Somewhat (adverb) means rather, or to a limited extent or degree. Identical can mean the very same or exactly alike. Either way, identical cannot be dimin- ished by modifiers like “a bit” / “rather” / “slightly,” and “somewhat,” any of which contradicts it. Some modifiers, such as almost or completely, which leave the second sense at least mostly in- tact (“The two paintings are almost identical”), are acceptable. Identical in the first sense (“He is the identical man who robbed us”) may not be modified at all. 2. Prepositions Is this picture identical with that pic- ture? Or is it identical to it? Grammari- ans have disagreed. Theodore Bernstein would accept ei- ther preposition. Wilson Follett would not use to: “a thing [has] identity with, not to, another.” That is so, and that is the British tradition, but American idiom accepts either, and you may choose. 3. Related words Words related to the adjective identi- cal include the adverb identically, the nouns identicalness and identity, and the verb identify. All are traced to the late Latin identitas, identity. In mathematics, an equation that is satisfied for all values of its symbol(s) is called an identical equation. In logic, a proposition whose subject and predicate amount to the same thing (“Nonexistence is not existence”) is an identical proposition. In poetry, an identical rhyme uses words or syllables that have the same sound, such as beat and beet. Identical twins are siblings who devel- oped from the same ovum and look the same. Identic is an archaic version of identi- cal as well as a diplomatic term. It may be defined as the same in form and sub- stance though not the same in wording; for example, identic communiqués is- sued by the United States and Russia. IDLE and IDOL. See Homophones. IDYLLIC. Idyllic means rural, natu- rally charming or picturesque, or suit- able for an idyl (also spelled idyll ), a pastoral poem. What is idyllic here? . . . His friends believed that the youngest of the Elliotts spent an idyl- lic childhood: growing up with his fa- ther, his mother, Lee, one brother and three sisters in Manhattan. . . . If the boy had grown up in, say, the Catskills, his childhood could have been described as idyllic. The adjective hardly seems appropriate when associated with modern Manhattan. An author writes about his experi- ences: The days had been idyllic and made for strolling, for sitting at sidewalk cafes, for sipping wine under a canopy. The author was in Paris, a metropolis of some two million people and, however 176 identical 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 176"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"pleasant, no more idyllic than New York City. In response to a suggestion that youngsters be taught to ride motorcycles properly, the host of a talk show said on television: That’s a great idea in an idyllic world, but that’s not the way we live. Did he really think that motorcycles would improve a pastoral setting? People often use “idyllic” mistakenly in place of ideal, a word that would fit all three quotations. The two sentences that follow do have pastoral elements, but they are overwrit- ten. Still, if The Avalanche [a Texas newspaper] mostly reflects an idyllic rural life style, it’s also a revealing in- dicator of change. It [an anti-American poster in Mos- cow] has been replaced by a new poster with drawings of a young American boy and a young Soviet girl in an idyllic, pastoral scene. “Idyllic rural” and “idyllic, pastoral” are both redundant.

A grammar says, “The indefinite pronouns are one, someone, anyone . . . and others of this same hazy ilk.” If you must use ilk in that way, at least never do so in Scotland, and leave out “same.” Same was the original meaning of ilk, in the Middle Ages, and remains its meaning in Scotland, at least in a nar- row way. As an adjective, ilk used to ap- pear in a phrase like this: the ilk night, meaning the same night. In modern times, ilk serves mainly to identify someone. It is used in a phrase like Macduff of that ilk, meaning of that same ( name is understood). It signifies that the person has the same name as the place he owns or comes from. It is like saying Macduff of Macduff. In the United States and England too, ilk is used loosely —The Oxford English Dictionary says “erroneously”—as a noun meaning class, kind, or family. It is usually meant to be facetious or deroga- tory. A comedian said in an interview, “It’s an unwritten rule among people of the same ilk.” The same ethnic group? (The “rule” presumably is that they may de- ride their group while outsiders may not.) ILLUSION and DELUSION. See Confusing pairs. IMMANENT, IMMANENCE. See EMINENT and IMMINENT. IMMEMORIAL. A candidate had accused an opposition party of dirty tricks. The leveling of such a charge is “a method that has been tried since time immemoriam,” a commentator said on television.

The latter is a Latin phrase used in epitaphs and obituary notices, meaning in memory. IMMIGRATE and EMIGRATE.

A forceful noun. 2. IM- PACT as a verb. 3. IMPACTED, an ad- jective. 1. A forceful noun. A forceful word is being enfeebled. Blame the increasingly sloppy and pre- tentious ways in which people who ought to know better are tossing it around these days. An impact is a violent contact or a striking of an object against another, or the force or shock of that contact or striking together. Too often it serves as a fancy synonym for effect, importance, influence, result, or the like. Interviewed on television, an econo- mist was asked about the effect of Mid- western floods on prices. He answered that it would have “a very small impact, almost unnoticed by the consumer.” Strictly speaking, “a very small im- pact” is a contradiction. If an effect is so small that one can hardly notice it, “im- pact” is not the word to choose. Use impact to suggest violence or power in the way things come together. When a giant meteor struck the earth, there was an impact. When two speeding cars collide head on, there is an impact. When a leaf falls gently to the ground, or when we talk about an economic effect, there is no impact. A television reporter made the follow- ing statement. (Emphasis is added to it and the ensuing examples.) Zebra mussels have already had a great impact on ways of doing busi- ness. Until scientists control their numbers, that impact will continue to grow. Those passive, immobile mollusks liter- ally have no “impact” on anything (with the possible exception of minute organ- isms that enter their systems). Even if a creative commentator could devise a way in which zebra mussels entered into a figurative “impact,” that “impact” would not “continue to grow.” An im- pact does not grow. The popular press is as accountable as anyone for the enfeeblement of the word. These are excerpts from three suc- cessive paragraphs of a news story: Other press analysts argued that re- porters’ party registration had no im- pact on the fairness of coverage. . . . Even inside journalism’s most influen- tial institutions there are sharp divi- sions on the impact personal views may have on coverage. . . . He [an edi- tor] said he feared political affiliations “could have an impact on coverage.” A learned professor of political sci- ence used the noun “impact” 100 times in an otherwise illuminating, 289 -page book. He used “impact” 4 1 ⁄ 2 times as of- ten as the combination of effect and in- fluence, two words that he could well have substituted throughout. Collectively, they [elements of the en- vironment] have a substantial impact on the Court’s decisions, an impact that merits examination. . . . It is likely that Congress has exerted a sub- tle impact on the Court’s policy choices. . . . Of course this kind of subtle impact is difficult to ascertain. . . . An impact is not “subtle.” It is force- ful. More examples from the same book: We can gain a fuller sense of the Court’s impact on society and the forces that shape that impact by look- ing at a few areas of the Court’s activ- ity. These examples provide reminders that the Court’s impact is complex. 178 imminent, imminence 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 178"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":". . . Until the late 1980 s it generally gave them [civil rights laws] expansive interpretations that enhanced their potential impact. There is evidence that the federal laws against employ- ment discrimination have had a signif- icant impact on the economic status of black citizens; this impact can be ascribed primarily to the other branches. And so on and on. 2. IMPACT as a verb Now that impact has been weakened, the next step in its ruination is the misuse of it as a verb. Two newspaper examples follow. So the question on many people’s mind is how will the downtown/wa- terfront ballpark impact our already congested streets and roadways? She expressed concern about how providing the initial medical treat- ment service . . . might impact other services at the hospital. Change each “impact” to affect. (In the former sample, also change “mind” to minds and the virgule, or slash, to a comma and space.) The writers not only used “impact” in the wishy-washy sense but further misused it as a verb. The noun and the verb express considerably different ideas and are pronounced dif- ferently. Impact (noun), a violent contact, was discussed in the first section. It is pro- nounced IM-pact. To impact (verb, transitive) is to squash something or to press things to- gether tightly, the way a garbage truck impacts garbage. It is pronounced im- PACT. The writers must have gone to school. What accounts for such slovenly En- glish? An article quoted a Massachusetts superintendent of schools turning the word in question into an intransitive verb. As a teacher, she had tried to tame an unruly little pupil, and “the time I had spent with him impacted on the other children.” She may have meant it affected them. It probably did not squash them. This example is from a form letter to bank customers: From a customer’s perspective, this general decline in interest rates has fa- vorably impacted mortgage interest rates, which are at their lowest level in many years. Does the letter contain metaphor—a vi- sion of interest rates being squeezed down—or merely a piece of roundabout prose? 3. IMPACTED, an adjective Impacted (adjective), pronounced im- PACT-ed, means jammed together, packed tightly in, or firmly wedged. It is used correctly in this sentence from a book, concerning an airplane flight in northern Africa: The firmest sand for our runway was the impacted Land-Rover track. Impacted has technical meanings in dentistry and medicine, denoting teeth or fractured bone ends that are abnormally wedged, or trapped dejecta. A dentist may say, “You have an impacted tooth,” perhaps speaking of a wisdom tooth that is firmly wedged in its socket and cannot emerge through the gum. An impacted condition is an impaction (noun). This is from a book on marketing: Any purchase is basically made on im- pulse, and response levels can be seri- ously impacted if the potential respondent does not act within a short time span. impact 179 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 179"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"The author presumably means that sales may be few if ad readers do not act soon.

See DISINTERESTED and UNINTERESTED. IMPEACH, IMPEACHMENT. A news announcement on a radio network and a headline in a newspaper reflected a popular misconception that “impeach- ment” meant removal from office: The Senate impeached him [a federal judge] on charges stemming from a perjury conviction—kicked him off the bench. Hatch predicts Senate won’t vote to impeach “Impeached” and “impeach” should have been convicted and convict. The Senate does not “impeach” anyone. The Constitution says: The House of Representatives . . . shall have the sole power of impeach- ment. . . . The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments. To impeach a public official is to pre- sent him with official charges of wrong- doing in office. Following impeachment, he goes on trial. If he is a federal official of the United States, the Senate tries him. If the Senate convicts him, in a two- thirds vote, the penalty cannot exceed re- moval from office and disqualification to hold a federal public office, although the convicted person remains liable to prose- cution elsewhere. The House of Representatives im- peached two presidents: Andrew John- son in 1868 and William J. Clinton in 1998 . The Senate tried both but con- victed neither. In 1974 President Richard M. Nixon avoided impeachment, for which the House Judiciary Committee had voted, by resigning as president. To impeach (verb, transitive) in a gen- eral sense is to discredit or impugn (a person or his motives, testimony, etc.). Imperative. See Mood; Subjunctive, 1. IMPLICATION. See IMPLY and IN- FER. IMPLY and INFER. The difference between these two words is like the dif- ference between saying and thinking. A speaker or writer implies. A listener or reader infers. To imply (verb, transitive) is to say in- directly, to hint or suggest. “The writer implies that the mayor is crooked.” To infer (verb, transitive or intransi- tive) is to conclude from evidence, to rea- son on the basis of something known or assumed. “From the facts in the article, a reader infers that the mayor is crooked.” At times “infer” is used by mistake when imply is meant. Misunderstanding can result. “He inferred that Charlie was the culprit” indicates that he drew such a conclusion from evidence. “He implied that . . .” indicates that he made a sug- gestion that may not have been backed by evidence. The second edition of Webster’s Dic- tionary gave as the (fifth) meaning of in- fer: “Loosely and erroneously, to imply.” Webster’s Third substitutes “to give rea- son to draw an inference concerning: HINT.” That is a meaning of imply.

This phrase en- ters accounts of meetings and other gatherings; for example: Responses to a four-page questionnaire given to those in attendance . . . will be taken into consideration in de- veloping the education reform pack- age. . . . “In attendance” is not wrong but some- what stilted and drawn out. Present or even attending would be crisper in that example. One writer seems fond enough of the phrase to use it three times in one article: Those in attendance last night . . . might have been years removed from the segregated world that Robinson challenged. . . . [ See also MAY and MIGHT. ] Branch Rickey III . . . was in attendance. . . . Also in attendance were Sandy Koufax, Lou Brock and Reggie Jackson. Chaucer had no need for “in atten- dance” when he wrote “A Shipman was ther” / “A good Wyf was ther,” and so on. “About 100 were in attendance at the meeting” can be simplified to “About 100 were there ” or “ 100 at- tended ” or “ 100 were at the meeting.” IN A WORD. This sentence appears in a book by a law professor: In a word (though requiring many qualifications), the laws and policies of the federal government are made by the Congress (even if largely, now, on Executive initiative), are carried out and enforced by the President, and applied by the courts in particular cases. A word? Forty words follow “in a word.” The phrase can make sense when used by a person of few words: “How was the show?” / “In a word, lousy.” One who is verbose can render it ludicrous, as in the sample sentence. (That sentence has an- other failing: an inconsistent series. Ei- ther leave out the second “are” or insert a third are just before “applied.” See also Series errors, 9. ) INCIDENCE and INCIDENT. The nouns incidence and incidents sound alike. They confused a congress- man, who said, in a widely broadcast speech to the Senate, “she related these incidences”—instead of incidents. An incident is a particular occurrence or happening, sometimes relatively triv- ial (“There was an amusing incident at work today”), sometimes troublesome (“A border incident could set off a war”). It can also be an episode in a liter- ary work. (“The final incident in the play comes as a surprise.”) Those who use in- incidence and incident 181 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 181"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"cident without qualification as a eu- phemism for a criminal, violent, or other unpleasant event (“Opponents booed the marchers, but there was no inci- dent”) may be overstretching the word. Incidence can mean occurrence in general or in the sense of extent, range, or manner of occurring. (“The incidence of the disease is widespread in this area.” / “I’m surprised at the incidence of this species so far north.”) It can also mean a falling on or striking, or the way in which something falls on or strikes something else. (“The angle of incidence was 45 degrees.”) The word is not usu- ally made plural. Two adjectives are incident, meaning likely to occur in connection with (“the dangers incident to a fireman’s life”), and incidental, occurring or likely to oc- cur by chance or as a minor result of something (“incidental expenses”). A re- lated adverb is incidentally, meaning in an incidental way, apart from the main matter, or by the way. The spelling inci- dently is obsolete and now usually con- sidered wrong. INCLUDE. See COMPRISE, 2. Incomplete sentence. See Sentence fragment. INCREDIBLE. If an announcer shouts about an “incredible offer,” take him at his word and don’t believe it. In- credible (adjective) primarily means not believable. It is from the Latin incredi- bilis, based on in-, not, and credibilis, credible, from credere, to believe. Many people came to use the word in a second way, to express not skepticism but amazement. Thus one might call a strange story or sight incredible, finding it hard to believe but still believing it. Still looser lips have diluted the word to an insipid slang sense, far removed from that of unbelievable. When a broadcaster said, “These are some of the authors that are incredible,” his inten- tion was to recommend their works. “In- credible” to him probably meant very good, great, superb, or any of dozens of synonyms. Yet he was literally condemn- ing their veracity. See also Double meaning (end); FAB- ULOUS; FANTASTIC; INCREDU- LOUS. INCREDULOUS. Incredulous (ad- jective) means skeptical, disbelieving, or unable to believe. That meaning applies only to people. “Despite his aggressive sales talk, she remained incredulous.” Incredulous can also refer to something one does to express disbelief: “With an incredulous wave of the hand, she left the show room.” Incredulous should not be confused with incredible, meaning not believable, which applies either to things or to people. The use of incredulous to mean incredible is obsolete and now generally considered erroneous. The defendant in a prominent lawsuit had just testified. Emerging from the courtroom, a man commented on televi- sion, “It was totally incredulous, every- thing he said.” Correction: “It was totally incredible [or “ unbelievable ”] . . .” or “ I was totally incredulous about ev- erything he said.” The word is barely changed from the Latin incredulus, from in-, not, and credulus, credulous. See also INCREDIBLE. INCREMENT. Sharing the first five letters of increase and its basic idea as well, increment derives from the Latin incrementum, meaning growth or in- crease. The quotations, from newspa- pers, show some skewed uses of our word.

The first sentence seems to use “incre- ment” to mean point; the second, to mean installment. Increment (noun) does not mean either. It is an increasing, or something that is added, or the amount of gain, or the amount by which something is growing. The idea of in- crease goes with increment. Increment as a verb (transitive and in- transitive) is not used often. A technical manual says: The line feed counter will be incre- mented one count for each line ad- vance. The word is used there correctly, al- though “be incremented” is a round- about way to say add. INDEPENDENCE. See DEMOC- RACY, FREEDOM, and INDEPEN- DENCE. INDESCRIBABLE, UNDESCRIB- ABLE. In the wake of a hurricane on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, a televi- sion reporter was on the scene. “It really is undescribable,” he said. Somehow he managed to describe it anyway, having been sent there to do so. On another program, a historical doc- umentary, the narrator said “the storm swept down with a grandeur and power that are indescribable.” She was thereby describing it. Undescribable is not wrong, although it is much less common than indescrib- able. They are paradoxical. It is hard to think of anything that is impossible to describe—perhaps some of the ultimate secrets of the universe?—yet that is what those adjectives mean. Nevertheless, when either is used, it is liable to accom- pany some kind of description. Even “in- describable joy” is a description. A synonym is inexpressible, less often unexpressible (adjectives), not subject to expression. An inexpressible (noun) is something that cannot be expressed. At one time inexpressibles applied to trousers. So did unmentionables (noun), which denoted underwear also and occa- sionally is still so used, in a jocular way. An unmentionable is that which should not be mentioned. Unmentionable (ad- jective) means unfit to be mentioned. Another synonym is unspeakable (ad- jective), meaning beyond speech, unfit to be spoken, or extremely bad or objec- tionable. See also Verbal unmentionables. INDIAN (AMERICAN).

Part of a main story in an eminent newspaper said: After the legislation had staggered under its own weight and the wither- ing attacks of Republicans and insur- inevitable 183 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 183"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"ance interests for months, Senator George J. Mitchell, the majority leader, bowed to the inevitable and announced that Congress would not pursue the issue any further this year. “The inevitable” seems to have been as- cribed supernatural power and station: One bows to it. The supporters of the bill (dealing with health care) probably did not know that it had been doomed by that mystic force, so they tried for months to pass it. The writer would have saved them all that trouble by informing them earlier of its fate. That which is inevitable (adjective) is certain to take place. It cannot be avoided, evaded, or prevented. Few events in society are like that. An example of the fallacy of attribut- ing inevitability to past events is a state- ment in a paper written by a collegiate freshman. Upon researching the Populist movement of the 1890 s, I penned the vacuous sentence “It was inevitable that the farmers would revolt.” Think of all the oppressed people of the world who do not “revolt.” Decades later, a network broadcaster commented, “It was probably inevitable that Hollywood would team up with Michael Jordan.” At least the “proba- bly” left some room for doubt, but think of all the sports stars with whom Holly- wood has not teamed up. Applying inevitable to future human events is especially dubious. (Some schools of thought deny the existence of free will, but who can predict the future with certainty?) The word was part of an exhortation to Congress and radio listeners by Presi- dent Franklin D. Roosevelt on December 8 , 1941 : With confidence in our armed forces, with the unbounded determination of our people, we will gain the inevitable triumph, so help us God. That “inevitable triumph” was condi- tioned upon two variables, those of “confidence” and “determination.” Yet even their fulfillment must not have en- sured inevitability; otherwise why was God entreated to “help us”? In a historical documentary on televi- sion, a narrator made the statement “But American participation in the war [World War I] was inevitable.” In place of “was inevitable,” came in 1917 or was declared by Congress or almost any other pertinent fact would have been more informative. During the height of the so-called Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, one often heard the sentence “War is inevitable,” anticipat- ing an atomic war between the two na- tions. Such a war did threaten on many occasions, but now that the Soviet Union is no more, the speakers of that phrase are proved wrong. Nevertheless, it was a dangerous phrase, fostering as well as re- flecting a grim fatalism. See also DESTINY. INEXPRESSIBLE. See INDESCRIB- ABLE, UNDESCRIBABLE. INFER, INFERENCE. See IMPLY and INFER.

It is identical with the imperative form, go or help; also with the form of the ordinary present tense in the third person plural, they speak or they walk, 184 inexpressible 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 184"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"and in the first person singular (except for I am ), I think or I see. Usually an infinitive is indicated by to: “He wanted to know. ”/ “She needs to leave. ” Infinitives without to regularly follow some verbs, such as can, let, may, might, must, and should (“The man can run ” / “You should try ”), and appear in certain constructions (“A crowd watched them fight ” / “I will quit rather than move ”). To plus infinitive may act as a noun, either in the subject (“ To build is a noble art”) or in the predicate (“Maria loves to sing ”). It may also act as an adjective (“John has an ambition to fly ”) or as an adverb (“They came to help ”). One to normally suffices for multiple infinitives of similar construction: “I want to finish my work and go home ”— the second to is understood. But a subse- quent to may be desirable for emphasis: “I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.” The use of to to indicate the infinitive (“I want to buy a pig”) should not be confused with any other use of to, e.g., to indicate direction or purpose (“I’m going to town to buy a pig”). See TO. See also Verbal, 3; Verbs, 1. 2. Gerund versus infinitive When to use the gerund and when to use the infinitive puzzles some writers and speakers. It is the difference between seeing and to see, between laughing and to laugh. The first is the -ing form of a verb when it serves as a noun. The sec- ond is the basic form of a verb, preceded by to. For instance, a broadcaster said: Not all dry cleaners share Robin B——’s enthusiasm to protect the en- vironment. A more idiomatic phrasing would be “enthusiasm for protecting the environ- ment.” Some other nouns would go with the infinitive: e.g., “ desire to protect” / “ wish to protect.” Still other nouns would go with the gerund: e.g., “ concern for protecting” / “ idea of protecting.” An infinitive is needed in this sen- tence, by a news agency: HELSINKI—President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia yesterday acknowl- edged his failure in winning President Clinton’s promise that no former So- viet republic will ever be allowed to join NATO. “In winning” should be to win. A cor- rect example of the former: “She is en- couraged by her success in winning the tournament.” There are no rules pointing to one form or the other. It is a matter of idiom and knowing how each verb is used. Dic- tionary examples can be instructive. See also Gerund, 3. 3. Perfect infinitive A form that borrows the term infini- tive but should not be confused with the form defined in 1 is the perfect infinitive. Examples are to have gone, to have made, and to have sung. Using to have and a past participle, it normally ex- presses action that is, was, or will be completed before another action or event indicated in the same sentence. “I’m happy to have won your confi- dence.” / “The office seemed to have been ransacked.” / “They plan to have built the house by the end of the year.” Sometimes the perfect infinitive is un- needed, as in this sentence from a novel: “He would have liked to have hugged his father.” Probably at that moment he would have liked to hug his father. Another example of a misuse of the perfect infinitive: “I planned to have moved.” It reverses the logical time se- quence. Make it “I had planned to move ”; the planning had to precede the moving. “He wants to be the first to have infinitive 185 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 185"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"bought a ticket” can be trimmed to “He wants to be the first to buy a ticket.” 4. Split infinitive To walk typifies the normal infinitive form. To quickly walk is a split infinitive. It is an infinitive form in which to and the verb are separated by a modifier (an adverb in the preceding example). Grammarians differ on the matter. One writes, “Don’t split your infinitives. They’d rather remain intact” (Karen E. Gordon). Another writes that “the split infinitive is an improvement of English expression” (George O. Curme). Split infinitives can be awkward, esp- cially when separated by more than a word or two. They can also be helpful at times in communicating one’s meaning. The two quotations that follow con- tain awkward splits. A radio announcer said, about the temperature, “It’s sup- posed to Sunday night drop lower.” The end of the sentence would have been a better place for “Sunday night.” Worse yet: in a sentence from a book, telling the author’s purpose, fourteen words sepa- rate to and the verb. (Those two words are emphasized here.) Its main idea is to historically, even while events are maturing, and di- vinely—from the Divine point of view —impeach the European system of Church and States. On the other hand, the fear of split- ting infinitives results in ambiguities like this: Some of the stones . . . failed com- pletely to melt before they reached the ground. It was quoted by Sir Ernest Gowers, whose comment cannot easily be im- proved upon: Did the hailstones completely fail to melt, or did they fail to completely melt? The reader has to guess, and he ought never to have to guess. In a book on lexicography, a seeming effort by its authors to avoid a split in- finitive has resulted in something worse: General lexicographers were com- monly content to use the Dictionary as a mine, without attempting greatly to extend its limits, at least until Richardson and Webster. Did the lexicographers make no great at- tempt or did they not attempt a great ex- tension? That is, which verb was the adverb “greatly” meant to modify: “at- tempting” or “extend”? More likely the authors intended the latter but wanted to steer clear of to greatly extend. They could have written “to extend its limits greatly, ” if they did not mind giving greatly more emphasis. . . . Linguistic stiffness . . . is a factor [in air accidents] that the NTSB inves- tigators, because of their own verbal awkwardness, have been unable quite to recognize. The writer of a magazine article failed to recognize the verbal awkwardness of “quite to recognize” instead of “ to quite recognize.” The style books of The Associated Press and The New York Times call for generally avoiding split infinitives but sometimes making exceptions. The latter condones “He was obliged to more than double the price” but forbids “ to clearly show. ” In the following sentence, from a Times article, an infinitive has been justi- fiably split in the manner of the forbid- den example (emphasis added): A special prosecutor said in court pa- pers made public today that she would urge the Supreme Court to quickly overturn a Federal appellate 186 infinitive 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 186"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"decision Friday that struck down the Federal law on special prosecutors. Where else could the adverb go? “To overturn quickly . . . a decision” would separate verb from object, in Germanic fashion. “She would urge the Supreme Court quickly ” could be misleading. Sometimes a split infinitive is hard to avoid: “ to half surmise the truth” (Robert Browning); “his fortune being jeopardized, he hoped to more than re- trieve it by going into speculations” (Theodore Roosevelt); “I’ve heard enough to about do for me” (Willa Cather). Furthermore, it can contribute to poetic rhythm. In his grammatical treatise, George O. Curme devoted five pages to examples of split infinitives by such writers as the po- ets Burns (“to nobly stem tyrannic pride”), Wordsworth (“to still further limit the hours”), and Byron (“To slowly trace the forest’s shady scene”). Curme said that inserting an adverb between to and the infinitive was a six-century-old practice that “cannot even in the strictest scientific sense be considered ungram- matical.” Yet he drew the line in some cases: “Almost everybody, however, puts not before the to of the infinitive. . . .” For example, “He promised not to do it again,” rather than “ to not do it again.” His explanation: not is felt as modifying, not the verb, but the infinitive phrase as a whole, to do it again. One writer seemed unable to decide between splitting and not splitting nega- tive infinitives, so she split the difference: Once called the loneliest man in America because of his agreement to not only integrate the major leagues but agree not to lash back at those who assailed him, he knew the impor- tance of his task. Make it “ not only to integrate.” (In ad- dition, omit “agree,” which is redun- dant; and substitute also, which is miss- ing. See NOT ONLY. A question of style is whether the twenty-nine words before the comma belong with the seven words after.) The splitting of infinitives, by adverbs and also by pronouns, goes back to the fourteenth century. A Biblical translation by John Purvey in 1388 said, “It is good to not ete fleisch and to not drynke wyn.” (The Revised Standard Version says, “. . . It is right not to eat meat or drink wine. . . .”) The practice, not common over the centuries, spurted in the nineteenth cen- tury; it was then that grammarians drummed up opposition to the form. Their knowledge of the classical lan- guages of Greek and Latin, in which the infinitive is a single word, may have in- fluenced them. The term split infinitive came later, near the end of the nine- teenth. The infinitive was a single word in Old English. It was a verbal noun (what the gerund is today), indicated by the suffix -an (or -ian ); for instance, “Ongan he writan ”: he began to write. The to go- ing with the infinitive originally meant toward. Thus to do in the sentence “Anger drove him to do it” would be construed as toward the doing of. Nowadays the to that goes with the infinitive, while categorized as a prep- osition, often is not felt as a preposition and serves merely as a signpost pointing to the infinitive word or phrase. Yet many consider it to be part of the infini- tive. The reality today is that the unsplit infinitive remains the norm, and doubt- less there are more than a few people who find the split kind somewhat dis- comforting. But you need not avoid splitting an infinitive if you have good reason to split it. A good reason is that it either expresses your meaning more clearly or sounds more natural. Bear in mind that a phrase like “ to be infinitive 187 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 187"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"adequately financed” or “ to have slightly misjudged” is not a split infinitive. It is not wrong for an adverb ( adequately ) to separate an auxiliary verb ( be ) from a main verb ( financed ). Grammatical au- thorities agree on that. An excessively finicky British official wrote, “They appeared completely to have adjusted themselves to it.” He had evidently put the adverb in that abnor- mal position in the belief that “ to have completely adjusted” would split an in- finitive. It would not. The infinitive would have been split by “ to completely have adjusted.” INFLAMMABLE. See FLAMMA- BLE, INFLAMMABLE, and NON- FLAMMABLE. Inflected and uninflected forms.

When a radio an- nouncer said “There’s been a lot of new innovation in the area of laser surgery,” she was using a redundant new. All inno- vation is new. Innovation (noun) is something that is newly introduced; a change in method, device, or mode of doing things; or the act of innovating. To innovate (verb, in- transitive) is to introduce something new or change that which is established. IN NO WAY, IN NO WISE. See NO WAY. IN ORDER TO. See TO, 2 (end). IN PERSON. See PERSON, 2. INSECT. The word insect properly applies only to a minute animal with six legs in the class Insecta. A book on first aid uses it loosely when it says: Insect bites and stings are not usu- ally dangerous except from the black widow spider, the brown recluse spi- der, and the scorpion. A spider, scorpion, tick, or mite is an arachnid, in the class Arachnida; each has eight legs. Popular speech often lumps all tiny creatures together as “insects” or “bugs.” A news magazine reported, un- der an article titled “INSECT ASIDES,” that “all sorts of bugs are making news.” Its first example concerned Japanese panic over an infestation of spiders — arachnids. A bug is a crawling insect or, more specifically, a type of crawling insect with a mouth adapted for piercing and sucking. INSIDE. See INTO, 1. INSOFAR AS, IN SO FAR AS. See FAR. INSTINCT. A book by a lexicogra- pher says, “We can all, by instinct, con- struct sentences more or less effortlessly.” By “instinct”? Although definitions vary, most sources agree that what the term instinct concerns is essen- tially inborn rather than learned. One learns a language. Perhaps this is what 188 inflammable 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 188"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"the author meant: “We can all construct sentences without much conscious ef- fort.” Instinct is often loosely used when ap- titude, impulse, intuition, reflex, skill, or the subconscious is meant. The Random House Dictionary ably defines instinct primarily as “an inborn pattern of activity or tendency to action common to a given biological species.” A migratory pattern of a bird or a mat- ing pattern of a fish may be termed an in- stinct. The tendency to act in such a manner or even the presumed force be- hind that tendency is also at times called an instinct. The choice of behavior is in- nate, although environmental events may trigger it and modify it. Related words are instinctive (adjec- tive) and instinctively (adverb). A news- paper article said: The driver of the Redman car in- stinctively braked when he saw the boulder flying toward them. . . . “Instinctively” should have been dropped or perhaps changed to reflex- ively. A reflex is an involuntary response to a stimulus. INSURANCE and ASSURANCE, INSURE and ENSURE. See AS- SURE, ENSURE, and INSURE, 1. INTER- and INTRA- prefixes. See Confusing pairs. INTEREST, INTERESTED. See DISINTERESTED and UNINTER- ESTED. INTERMINABLE. Interminable (adjective) literally means not ter- minable, unending, lasting forever. Few things last forever, if anything does. One could strictly speak of the interminable universe, although some cosmologists believe that even the universe will end eventually. The word can be extended to mean unending for practical purposes (“the sun’s interminable energy”) or seeming to last forever (“the country’s inter- minable fiscal troubles”). However, it does not make sense to apply it to some- thing that plainly has an end, as a college teacher did: Moving up the state’s presidential primary would only lengthen the al- ready interminable period of presi- dential selection. Logically, that which is interminable cannot be lengthened. Anyway, to apply that word to a period of presidential se- lection is absurd. The period terminates on the day that a president is elected. A critic called a film a “brain- numbing barrage . . . that lasts nearly two hours,” and he ridiculed a scene at “the end of this interminable picture.” It terminated after nearly two hours. “The end of this interminable picture” is a contradiction. A music reviewer wrote of a sym- phonic concert with “an interminable in- termission.” The conductor “filled the second half of the concert with . . . extro- verted tone painting. . . .” Inasmuch as the concert had a second half, the inter- mission was not interminable. See also ETERNITY. IN TERMS OF. 1. Legitimate and il- legitimate uses. 2. Need for another preposition. 3. Need for rewriting or re- thinking. 1. Legitimate and illegitimate uses The phrase in terms of is encountered often in speech and writing, and usually it is empty verbiage. It has a legitimate use; it introduces a translation to an- other language, jargon, or way of speak- ing: in terms of 189 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 189"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"“The buyer must beware—or, in terms of Latin, caveat emptor. ” / “In terms of baseball, our fund drive enters the ninth inning and to win we need a home run with the bases loaded.” / “To win back her love, you have to start talk- ing in terms of endearment.” More often its use is either a slovenly way of tying together two dissimilar ideas or a pretentious substitute for a simple word or phrase that is more to the point. Frequently one of these will do the job better than “in terms of”: about, as, as for, as to, by, concerning, of, and regarding. Even the three-word phrases with regard to and with respect to may be preferable. 2. Need for another preposition Expressing something in other terms through mathematical equation is what science does continually. Yet the loose use of “in terms of” is not absent from scientific writing. In a book on contemporary physics, the authors use “in terms of” three times in as many pages. (Emphasis is added to the excerpts.) Though we have described the pro- cess of electron scattering in terms of the exchange of a single photon be- tween two charged particles, there is also the possibility that two, or more, photons will be exchanged. These [nuclear] forces each have their associated fields, which can be de- scribed in terms of messenger parti- cles, analogous to photons. The existence of similar descrip- tions of all three forces—electromag- netic, weak and strong —in terms of messenger particle exchanges has en- couraged the belief that a common unified description of the forces might be found. In the first and third sentences, they could have replaced “in terms of” with as; in the second sentence, with as ex- changes of. Again, there are valid uses for in terms of. The authors explain forces and fields in terms of quantum electrodynamics. Occasionally all one needs to do is leave words out. A medical researcher is explaining the close relationship be- tween human immunodeficiency virus and simian immunodeficiency virus: “ In terms of the target cells they en- ter, in terms of the known modes of transmission, and in terms of the dis- ease caused, they are very similar.” Except for the first “In,” the emphasized words could be scrapped with no sacri- fice to the message. 3. Need for rewriting or rethinking Sometimes no first aid will help; the sentence must be recast or the ideas must be rethought. This newspaper sentence concerns a breaking and entering at a political campaign office in Washington, D.C.: Last night’s “vandalism,” the word preferred by Martin D. Franks, ex- ecutive director of the committee, according to Mr. Johnson, was so in- substantial, in terms of what were termed “sensitive files” that remained locked in undisturbed cabinets, that the committee denied permission to- day for photographs. “. . . In terms of” is bad enough. “. . . In terms of what were termed” compounds the trouble. The sentence could have been patched up by replacing “in terms of” with inasmuch as and throwing out the first “that.” Other faults would re- main, however. (The story mentions “Mr. Johnson” four times, never saying who he is. Moreover, by the placement 190 in terms of 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 190"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"of the phrase “according to Mr. John- son,” it tends to apply only to the “word preferred” phrase. And the clause about photographs is almost a non sequitur.) So the story was revised for a later edi- tion: “Vandalism” was the word pre- ferred by Martin D. Franks, executive director of the committee, to describe last night’s incident, according to Mark Johnson, the campaign com- mittee’s press secretary. . . . What he described as “sensitive files” were still safely under lock and key, he said. The revised story (saying nothing about photographs) is an improvement. (But “What he described as” is unnecessary, inasmuch as “sensitive files” is in quota- tion marks and the sentence ends with “he said.”) The passages below are from a biog- raphy. Nothing but thorough recasting of the sentences could help them. In terms of the prosecutor’s future philosophy, there seemed not to be one word in the controversy about the freedom of the press provided under the First Amendment. In terms of professional memberships, moreover, nothing succeeded like suc- cess, as Black himself noted in an in- terview published after his death—“I was trying a lot of cases against cor- porations, jury cases, and I found out that all the corporation lawyers were in the Klan. . . .” Sticking an “in terms of” into a sentence is no replacement for clear thinking. No one can be expected to speak in terms of a future philosophy or otherwise foresee the future. (Besides, there cannot be one word about press freedom; it takes at least two words.) The first sample sen- tence from the biography could be rewritten this way: The prosecutor’s arguments did not foreshadow his future philosophy. There seemed to be nothing in the controversy about. . . . The latter quotation from the book is unwieldy and obscure, somehow tying professional memberships to the cliché about success and tacking on a quota- tion with still another idea. A rescue at- tempt would be futile. INTERNECINE. Internecine (pro- nounced inter-NIECE-sin, among other ways) is a useful adjective in the sense of mutually destructive. It comes from the Latin internecinus, meaning murderous. A word so derived should be expected to bear the concept of deadliness. Indeed internecine originally meant character- ized by bloodshed or slaughter. It came to mean deadly to both adver- saries in an armed conflict. This is a use- ful interpretation, for no other single word expresses the idea. Still later, it was given another twist. Evidently assuming that the first six let- ters came from internal, some began ap- plying internecine to internal conflicts, e.g., “America’s internecine struggle of the 1860 s.” Now we often find the element of deadliness, the essence of internecine, slighted or forgotten altogether and the word serving merely as a synonym for internal in connection with verbal, polit- ical, or other harmless disagreements within a group. In a TV forum, a newspaper publisher was discussing South Africa’s leadership: Botha and his successor, de Klerk, are apparently having internecine war- fare. internecine 191 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 191"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"They were not actually shooting at each other; they simply disagreed on policy. This is from a prominent newspaper: The prospect of a Warner defection in two years could shatter the party unity . . . and throw Republicans into an internecine war.

Interrogative sentence. See (-)EVER; Punctuation, 9. INTO. 1. IN and INTO. 2. IN TO and INTO. 3. Slang use. 1. IN and INTO The preposition in indicates position, location, or condition. Among its vari- ous senses, it means inside; within the area or confines of (the house, the city, the deal, etc.). The preposition into indicates mo- tion, direction, or change in condition. It often means to the interior of (a place); from the outside to the inside of (the place). “The children are jumping into the pond” clearly indicates their movement from the banks to the water. “The chil- dren are jumping in the pond” is less clear; they may have already been in the water when they started jumping. “We walked into the house” clearly indicates that we entered the house. “We walked in the house” is less clear; we may have already been in the house when we decided to tour the place. Some contexts in which into is right allow in as an option. “They let him into [or “in”] the country.” / “Throw the peel into [or “in”] the trash can.” The verb put goes with either in or into. (“Put the dishes in [or “into”] the cupboard.”) But idiom dictates the com- panionship of the verb place and in. (“Place the dishes in [not “into”] the cupboard.”) Into can also mean against (“The truck crashed into a utility pole”), to a certain form or condition (“The vase broke into little pieces” / “Matter can change into energy”), to an occupation (“She is going into real estate”), or toward (“We must look into the fu- ture”). 2. IN TO and INTO When in, serving as an adverb, comes in contact with the preposition to, a writer may erroneously unite them. The resulting “into” can grossly distort the meaning. Such a mistake could cause alarm. “The ship came in to the pier” simply means that it docked. “The ship came into the pier” means that it crashed. The mistake could cause just mirth. “A man wanted as an army deserter for fifteen years turned himself into the sher- iff’s office last night.” Unless the reporter was describing a magical transforma- tion, the in and the to should have been separate. 3. Slang use “Fred is in sales” indicates that selling is his occupation. “Fred is going into sales” indicates that he intends to enter that occupation. The era of “flower chil- dren” and “Do your own thing” brought the use of into in the sense of a continuing participation in a vocation or avocation. One would say “I’m into painting,” instead of “I do painting” or simply “I paint.” The term persisted, and a daily paper said a designer of science exhibits was “so into tornadoes” that his contribu- tion to a testimonial dinner was a choco- late tornado. “Into” was a columnist’s slangy substitute for absorbed in, con- 192 interrogative sentence 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 192"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"cerned with, enthralled by, interested in, or taken by.

Did the writer of this headline (ten years after the Watergate scandal) intend to convey a double meaning? “Why Nixon Is Still Intriguing.” Intriguing can mean plotting intrigue. Intrigue as a noun means secret or un- derhanded scheme or scheming. It can also denote a secret love affair (one thing that Nixon was not accused of). The verb intrigue, in its most settled mean- ings, means (intransitively) to engage in intrigue and (transitively) to plot, to cheat, or to achieve or get through in- trigue. The present participle is intrigu- ing. Commonly the verb intrigue (transi- tive) is used as a synonym for enchant, excite, fascinate, interest, make curious, mystify, puzzle, or perplex; intriguing as an adjective meaning enchanting, excit- ing, fascinating, etc. Such use is not ac- cepted by all. H. W. Fowler pooh-poohed it as a Gallicism (it came from the French tran- sitive verb for puzzle, intriguer ) “confus- ing the sense of a good English word.” His reviser, Sir Ernest Gowers, wrote that a reason for its popularity was that it could convey the meanings of two words at once; he cited puzzle and fasci- nate. “But,” he went on, “it is still true that intrigue is often used in place of a simpler and better word. . . .” Theodore Bernstein found the verb turned into “a fuzzy, all-purpose word” in place of various precise words. Just 52 percent of The American Heritage Dic- tionary ’s usage panel approved of the popular use of the verb. On the liberal side, Roy H. Copperud called such use “well established . . . despite carping by some pedants.” These are excerpts from a book by the editors of a news magazine: What made Gorbachev a truly in- triguing Man of the Year was that . . . so little was known about him. . . . This reassuring rhetoric was in- triguingly . . . similar to what liberal Western strategists had accepted as conventional wisdom for decades. . . . But Gorbachev’s choice [of a con- stituency] was intriguing. . . . Eco- nomic stagnation and political torpor [under Brezhnev] seemed to hatch corruption and intrigue in the highest places. Following the contestable use of intrigu- ing twice and intriguingly (adverb), fi- nally intrigue is used strictly in the last quoted sentence. INUNDATE, INUNDATED. While television cameras focused on a huge fire in southern California, a re- porter called attention to some houses “just about to be inundated by the flames.” Not burned, consumed, or de- stroyed, but “inundated.” His choice of verb could hardly have been further from the mark. To inundate is to flood, to cover with water in the manner of an overflowing river. Drought and water shortage had contributed to the fire dis- aster. Inundated can equal deluged, flooded, or swamped. Used figuratively, any of those words is drenched with metaphor. When the moderator of a forum said, “At this point in time, the American people are completely inundated with polls,” he overdid it. Scratch “com- pletely.” ( See also “ AT THIS POINT IN TIME. ”) inundate, inundated 193 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 193"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"The pronunciation is IN-nun-date(d) or, less often, in-NUN-date(d).

When a boy in a situation comedy said, “I got a special invite [pronounced IN-vite] tonight to a dance at Hamilton High,” he was perfectly in character. The word is most informal though. Its use was questionable when a broadcaster on a specialized news program boasted of an “exclusive invite” to a TV wedding. A courteous request for a person to attend an event or to participate in an activity is an invitation. So is a note used in extending it. To extend an invitation is to invite (someone), pronounced in- VITE. INVOKE. See EVOKE and INVOKE. Iran. A factual error mars this passage, from a newspaper: The [Persian Gulf] crisis has shaken the Mideast regional power balance. Egypt has moved to the forefront, and Syria and Iran have moved toward the Arab mainstream. Iran is not “Arab.” Its official and pre- dominant language is not Arabic but Farsi, which uses the Arabic alphabet plus four additional letters. Formerly Persia, this sizable southwest Asian country has its own culture and tradi- tions. It does share the Muslim religion with the Arab countries, like Egypt and Syria, although Iranians mostly belong to the Shiah sect whereas the Sunni pre- dominates in most Arab countries. Iran is pronounced either ih-RAN or, more authentically, ee-RON. IRONY, IRONIC, IRONICALLY. 1. Contrast essential. 2. SARCASM, SATIRE. 1. Contrast essential Upon reporting that a maritime colli- sion had cost a company a vessel, a newscaster told the television audience: Ironically it’s the same company that lost a boat in a collision ten years ago. There was nothing ironic (adjective) about it. The two incidents were parallel. Contrast is the essence of irony (noun). Ironically (adverb) would have been an appropriate word if, for example, the maritime company had been known for ads promoting safety afloat but then caused a collision. Irony can be a noteworthy incon- gruity of events, a glaring contrast be- tween what one could have reasonably expected and what actually happens. Irony is also a literary style, a rhetorical figure, or a humorous device. The con- trast then is between the apparent mean- ing of words that are written or spoken and a far different meaning beneath the surface. 2. SARCASM, SATIRE Sarcasm is similar to irony in the con- trast between literal meaning and in- tended meaning, but sarcasm implies overt ridicule or taunting; irony is milder and subtler. Related words are sarcastic (adjective) and sarcastically (adverb). “This is a fine time to be telling me!” is a sarcastic remark. Satire (noun) is a literary or dramatic style using irony to attack or ridicule something held to be wrong or foolish. Related words are satirical (adjective) and satirically (adverb). A writer of clas- sic satire was Jonathan Swift, best known for Gulliver’s Travels. 194 inversions 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 194"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"“ IRREGARDLESS.” See REGARD- LESS.

Dryden wrote also, “Whatever is, is in its causes just.” The poet Ella Wheeler Wilcox wrote that “whatever is—is best.” This is a translation from Hegel: “Everything that is, is reasonable.” A more recent example is President Clin- ton’s reply to a question in testimony, “It depends upon what the meaning of the word is is.” Usually, however, as the following quotations from television suggest, the echoed word is not the product of thought. A member of Congress: “The fact is is that there’s nothing there” (in an investigation of the president). An as- tronomer: “The problem is is that we’ve got an enormous amount of work to get done right now.” An appraiser: “The good news is is it’s worth three to five thousand dollars.” A writer and TV pan- elist: “The fact of the matter is is that he [the president] is in deep trouble.” Each second “is” was superfluous.

The letters slant to the right (and use fewer serifs than roman, the common book type). Writers and editors underline those words in manuscripts that they want to be italic. Thus this is a sample becomes this is a sample. Among other functions, italics indi- cate that a word is not playing its usual role, that of contributing to meaning, but is being considered as a word. For instance, this book discusses me and I. It deals also with and and but. Names of books, dramatic works, works of art, publications, and genera and species go in italics: Moby-Dick by Melville; The Glass Menagerie by Williams; Leonardo’s Mona Lisa; Mozart’s opera The Marriage of Figaro; an article in Time; the lion, Felis leo. ( See also Punctuation, 10. ) Italics serve also to distinguish foreign words or phrases that are not also con- sidered part of English, such as semper fidelis and et tu, Brute!; introduce new terms: “ Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is developing . . .”; and enumerate points, principles, or questions that an author wishes to stress. Italics call attention to a particular word or phrase. It may be one that would be emphasized if the sentence were spoken: “When I use a word,” Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, “it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less.” The highlighted word may be one that is not usually emphasized, as in this exam- ple from a book on economics: The discovery that man needs stimu- lation as well as comfort is not new. After all, the ancient Romans clam- ored for bread and circuses. It may be an unexpected word: “Are the wages of sin wealth ?” Or two words may be contrasted: “If he will not do it, she will.” Italics are effective when used in mod- italic(s) 195 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 195"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"eration. A few writers overdo them, itali- cizing passages here and there in efforts to gain readers’ attention. The word italic (adjective and noun) is so named because it first appeared in an Italian book (an edition of Virgil printed in Venice in 1501 ). The word italics (noun) is often construed as plu- ral, sometimes as singular. Styles of italic go with the various ro- man styles. When a word in an italic pas- sage needs emphasis, it may be printed in roman. Another device for emphasis is the heavy form of type known as bold- face. Italics and boldface are sometimes combined in boldface italics. IT, anticipatory. See Expletives. “IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING.” See OF COURSE, 3. IT IS I (HE, SHE) and IT’S ME (HIM, HER).

Colonize is accepted now as a standard word. Customize, featurize, sanitize, and manhattanize have reached acceptance at least as jargon. Mencken later, in the first supplement to his work, listed forty more that had been coined “in recent years.” By then, he had learned that -ize words dated to the Middle Ages, and he no longer called them “monstrosities.” But we can be glad that few of them sur- vive. Those on his list that have been generally accepted (excluding trade names) are glamorize and publicize; two others, finalize and moistureize (now without the first e ), have reached the sta- tus of jargon. Many seem attracted to -ize because it appears impressive, official, or technical. But it is often weak and unnecessary, and the multiplication of -ize verbs adds monotony to the language. “Finalize,” for instance, serves more often as a bureaucratic and pretentious synonym for complete, finish, or end than as a necessary verb. “Moisturize” essentially says dampen or keep moist, although it can imply the use of a com- mercial product. A candidate for district attorney said in an election statement: We must prioritize the prosecution of violent, repeat offenders. “Prioritize” is no fist-pounding verb.

Did “maximize” exceed extend, pro- long, spread, or stretch in clarity or just in pomposity?

Jew denotes either a descendant of the Hebrews or one who adheres to the Judaic religion, whether through birth or conversion. The name comes from the Hebrew yehudi, origi- nally a member of the tribe of Judah. Two critiques, in a reference book and an editorial, bear criticism them- selves. Each contains an unacceptable word. An author objected to careless use of the terms Jew and Jewish in connection with Israel: Although that nation is closely identi- fied with the Jewish race and religion, the expressions Israeli and Jewish are not interchangeable. An “Editorial Board” expressed reservations about a presidential candi- date that it was endorsing: We don’t endorse anti-Semitism of any kind, and we’re not happy about some of Jackson’s racial slurs and in- sensitivity toward Jews. In the first sample, the objectionable word is “race.” (A good substitute would have been people. ) In the second sample, the word “racial” should have been scrapped. When there are African Jews, Chinese Jews, and Jews of just about every race, it makes no sense to refer to Judaism in racial terms. Contrary to Hitler’s doc- trine, there is no Jewish race. The point made in the book about the separateness of Israeli and Jewish is valid. It is incorrect to speak of the Is- raelis as “the Jews,” the way some ad- versaries of Israel have done. Only about 30 percent of the world’s 14 mil- lion Jews live in Israel, and about 18 percent of the Israelis—that is, the citi- zens of the State of Israel—are non- Jews, mostly Moslems. Jew is a noun only (e.g., “Jesus was a Jew”). The related adjective is Jewish (“a Jewish temple” / “a Jewish woman”). Using “Jew” in its place is derogatory. Hebrew is the name of a language and an ancient people. It is not “in mod- ern usage interchangeable with Jew, ” contrary to a dictionary’s statement.

The average newspaper ed- itor is unlikely to put unemployment compensation in a headline when he can save space with “jobless pay,” even though “jobless” misses the mark in that phrase. An unemployed person can be called jobless; it is not the “pay” that lacks a job. Joblessness is comparable to unemployment, but the press does not use the former often; it saves only one letter. “Jobless” has branched out from the headlines into the bodies of news stories and into newscasting. A news agency re- ported: Blue-chip stocks fell in subdued trading Tuesday as investors stood on the sidelines waiting for Friday’s key jobless numbers for September. A TV newscaster announced a “jump in jobless claims.” Another reported that “the number filing jobless claims dropped. . . .” Still another: “California’s jobless rate has also dropped slightly.” So far the word has not entered the vernacular. A laid-off worker is likely to say, “I got my unemployment [not “job- less”] check today.” Joining of words. Some writers feel compelled to join pairs of words that are perfectly comprehensible when left sepa- rate. The result can be misleading. A newspaper item said an ex-president had thanked “the secret serviceman credited with saving his life after an assassination attempt. . . .” Although an intelligence agent in the armed services could possi- bly be described as a “secret service- man,” the recipient of the thanks was a Secret Service man. Usually the reader is unlikely to be ac- tually misled by unwieldy fusions, such as “Assemblymember” for Assembly member, “autoworkers” for auto work- ers, or “eightmillion” for eight million. More likely such behemoths will just look like mistakes and stop the reader momentarily. Because two words often go together, the writer may think they are wedded. The phrase damn yankee has been so common in the South that some people have thought it is a single word. Printed works can be inconsistent in their choices of words to unite. This is from an autobiography: “We were intro- duced to the great military thinkers and their ideas—Mahan on sea power, Douhet on airpower. . . .” Another author practices ortho- graphic discrimination by writing, in a book of reminiscences, “Blackamericans are different from white Americans.” Phrases that have been published in fused form include these thirty-five: ad writers, auto maker, best seller, break even, business folk, cab driver, care givers, catch phrases, child care, com- mon sense, decision making, dining room, down payment, drug war, face down, front lines, full text, fund raising, good will, hard cover, home care, house cleaning, job seeker, market share, news writers, night watchman, park land, phone book, round trip, trap doors, word games, word play, work force, working women, work station. The innumerable “-person” and “-people” monstrosities can be added to the list. See PEOPLE as a suffix; PER- SON. Sometimes hyphenated adjectives like cold-blooded; head-on; hour-long, month-long, etc.; long-time; short-lived; small-town; and worn-out are divested of their hyphens and jammed together. A restaurant announces “HOMESTYLE COOKING” on its sign and “Home Style Cooking” on its menus. The adjec- tive is home-style.

Each of these nine phrases gives somewhat more emphasis to the second word; joining the two words obscures that fact: best seller, common sense, down payment, front lines, full text, good will, night watch- man, round trip, and trap doors.

The popular press gener- ally misunderstands. . . . The incident raised questions about whether K—— had violated a judge’s rule that says a jurist “should not lend the prestige of his office to advance the private interests of oth- ers.” The rule applied to a judge; it said noth- ing about a “jurist.” Evidently the re- porter, thinking it was a synonym for judge, used “jurist” to avoid repeating “judge.” In another newspaper, a columnist ap- peared to do the same thing: . . . The Senator, himself a former ju- rist, wondered out loud if Judge Bork was really a true conservative. . . . If the senator is a “former” jurist, he must have forgotten what he knew about law. Here is a similar example but with a little puzzle: who is the “jurist”? Neither California nor U.S. judicial rules of misconduct appear to apply to a questionable $ 1 million legal fee awarded lawyer E—— W—— by a San Francisco judge before the jurist’s appointment to the federal bench. Either man could be a “jurist.” The con- text verifies that the judge was the one. There is nothing wrong with “the judge’s appointment.” If the writer found the prospect of repeating a word too dread- ful, he could have written “the latter’s appointment.” A reappearance of “the jurist’s,” six paragraphs later, could eas- ily have been avoided: jurist 201 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 201"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":". . . The time limit to investigate a matter of alleged impropriety for a sit- ting judge is six years prior to the start of the jurist’s current term. Replace “the jurist’s” with his. (And make those “judicial rules of miscon- duct” the Code of Judicial Conduct. ) Another story indirectly quoted a judge on the reinterpretation of princi- ples by “successive generations of ju- rors.” The writer probably knew the difference between judges and jurors, members of juries, but mixed up his j- words. The examples above come from gen- eral newspapers. One might think that the staff of a newspaper for the legal profession would know better than to run anything like “Review Calendar Forces Jurist to Do Double Duty” (head- line) and “the assignment has passed to several jurists” (text underneath).

An example, “These kind of birds live . . .” instead of Birds of this kind live or This kind of bird lives. Kind itself may be made plural, in representing more than one class or vari- ety: Many kinds of fruit grow / All kinds of tools are sold. In these examples, fruit is regarded as an abstract category; tools are regarded as concrete items. The grammarian H. W. Fowler for- gave irregular uses of kind of just “in hasty talk.” Confusion is common, even in more careful use. A U.S. president spoke publicly of “those kind of tests,” instead of tests of that kind. To use a word like all, many, some, these, or those with kind and a plural noun and verb used to be generally ac- ceptable. Wyclif wrote: “. . . Alle kynd of fishis gedrynge” (gathering); Shake- speare: “These kind of knaves I know” and “To some kind of men . . .”; and Flatman: “Such kind of Pamphlets work wonders with the credulous Multitude.” The Oxford English Dictionary says of the amalgam of kind of and plural: “This is still common colloquially, though considered grammatically incor- rect.” The Random House Dictionary, pointing out the objections to that form, offers the historical explanation that kind once was an unchanged plural noun like sheep and that the s- plural de- veloped later. The usage panel of The American Heritage Dictionary rejected “Those kind of buildings seem old-fashioned” ( 90 percent) and “that kind of buildings seem” ( 75 percent) for formal writing but approved “What kind of books are these?” ( 76 percent). A question begin- ning with what or which is a more ac- ceptable deviation. Although the second edition of Web- ster’s Dictionary said kind of was used with a plural “incorrectly,” Webster’s Third accepts the disputed forms with- out qualification or mention of any ob- jections.

Properly used with A or AN Kind of in another sense may go with a. Being a kind of or a sort of critic, poet, vagabond, or something else can be the same as being something of a critic etc. It often implies that the person possesses the characteristics of the specified class to a certain extent but not fully. “She’s a kind of butterfly.” / “George is a sort of expert.” The same goes for kind of a (or an ) or sort of a (or an ). “My boss is kind of a tyrant.” / “They say Fred is sort of an animal at home.” Either way, a second indefinite arti- cle—“ a kind of a ” or “ a kind of an ”—is redundant.

Replacing RATHER or SOMEWHAT Kind of is used colloquially (as an ad- verb) to mean rather, somewhat, in a way, or to some extent: “We were kind of surprised by the news.” / “The weather is kind of brisk today” / “I kind of miss her.” Sort of is used similarly. Neither is suitable for careful writing. 5. Used “vulgarly” The of in kind of is “vulgarly” slurred (the Oxford ’s label). The result may be spelled “kind o’ ” / “kind a’ ” / “kinda” / “kinder,” or otherwise. Dickens put “Theer’s been kiender a blessing fell upon us” in a character’s mouth. The same is done to the of in sort of, producing “sorta” and so on. KISS OF DEATH. See WHICH. KNOT. When a mariner speaks of a ship’s going, say, forty knots, he is indi- cating speed, not distance. A knot is one nautical mile per hour. Television narrators said, over films of ships, “The cruising speed is fifty knots per hour” and “The Starship will do twenty knots an hour on the open ocean.” With knots, “per hour” or “an hour” is superfluous. A phrase like “fifty nautical miles per hour” would be ac- ceptable—at least for landlubbers. A nautical mile, also known as a geo- graphical, sea, or air mile, is used by ships and aircraft. It equals one minute of a great circle of the earth, about 6 , 076 feet, or about 1 . 15 statute miles. A statute mile, also known as a land mile, is the ordinary mile, about 5 , 280 feet. KODAK. Kodak is a trademark, origi- nally the name of a popular camera, now more often associated with camera films and photocopying machines. Old dictionaries contain two words derived from the camera’s name: the verb kodak, to take a snapshot, and the noun, kodaker, one who takes snap- shots. H. L. Mencken called them, along with kodak fiend, “familiar derivatives.” All are now obsolete. He repeatedly used Kodak and other trade names in lower case, but they should be capitalized. George Eastman coined the name of the camera he invented, registering it in 1888 . He said the name was arbitrary. It has not been tied to Kodiak island or the Kodiak bear. The K probably came from his mother’s maiden name, Kilbourn. KUDOS. This noun originated as Greek for glory and fame.

Laszlo is his last name. What we do not know is his surname, or family name. In Hungary a citizen’s surname comes first; his given name comes last. If that fact surprises some people who know some- thing about Hungary, it is because writ- ers in English switch the names around. For instance, the composer known as Béla Bartók was really Bartók Béla. The practice is so pervasive, it may be futile to try to change it. Just do not call his surname his “last name.” In China and Japan too the surname comes first, then the given name. In En- glish writing, names of Chinese are usu- ally left in the traditional order (Mao Tse-tung), but names of Japanese are usually reversed (Akira Kurosawa). Most immigrants to the United States adopt its customary order of names. LATIN(-)AMERICAN. 1. LATIN AMERICA and SPANISH AMERICA. 2. LATINO, HISPANIC, SPANISH, MEXICAN, and CHICANO. 1.

What do Spanish speakers have to do with Haiti? The Haitians speak French. Latin America is by no means syn- onymous with Spanish America.

This has given way to a use of the Spanish word latino, capitalized. In Spanish it primarily means of the Latin language (adjective) or a scholar in the Latin language (noun). It is often used in the United States to mean a person here with any ethnic tie to Latin America. It is used also as an (attributive) adjective, “this country’s Latino population,” an un- Spanish form. (Spanish would say la población latina. ) Another popular term, older and somewhat more formal, is Hispanic. As an adjective, it has long meant Spanish, in the sense of pertaining to or originat- ing in Spain. In the popular use of His- panic, the adjective includes Spanish America and the word serves also as a noun, meaning a person with ties to ei- ther place. A Spanish person is one from Spain and nowhere else, although a Spanish- speaking person may be from anywhere else. It is incorrect to use the adjective “Spanish” in lieu of Mexican, although such use has sometimes been quietly en- couraged by Americans of Mexican ori- gin as a response to discrimination. In recent decades they have more promi- nently used Chicano to describe them- selves (from an elision and dialectal pronunciation of Mexicano, meaning Mexican); however, some Mexican- Americans object to the term. LATTER. 1. As adjective. 2. As pro- noun. 3. With number. 1. As adjective The latter refers to the second of two things or persons mentioned. The com- parable term for the first of the two is the former. Latter is used correctly as a compara- tive adjective in this way: After two choices have been offered, one might say, “The latter choice is more practical.” Or, if one has been asked to choose between two paragraphs: “I prefer the latter para- graph.” The word is used incorrectly to refer to the last of three or more things. Fur- thermore, its use can have other draw- backs. An article enumerates six local politi- cal meetings that took place in one night and adds: “It was the latter event that drew the most political luminaries.” Last, not “latter,” would be grammati- cally correct; so would last-mentioned or last of those events. But any of the terms could slow down readers by sending them back to find out what it pertains to. Although the writer did not need to re- peat the thirty words used to describe the particular event, he could have made a capsule reference to it: “The birthday dinner drew the most political luminar- ies.” The “latter” device, aimed at verbal economy, sometimes brings verbosity.

The latter attribute may not seem very important un- less, like me, you once had your nerves . . . shattered daily by the jack- hammer clanking of a dot matrix or daisy wheel printer. Last instead of “latter attribute” would be correct but still roundabout. If the au- thor had replaced “latter attribute” with quietness, he would have been correct, saved a word, and avoided a conspicu- ous circumlocution. latter 207 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 207"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"This passage is from an article in a fi- nancial newspaper: The quarry gang was the macho crew. They never wore shirts, vied for the deepest tans, walked with a dis- tinctive “strut,” and clinched their belts unbelievably tight to accentuate a “Scarlett-O’Hara”-type waistline. (This latter habit the camp physician believed to be at least partially re- sponsible for the four cases of appen- dicitis during the year I spent at Henryville.) Changing “latter” to last would improve the third sentence but not completely fix it. A “habit” is a noun, whereas the pre- vious sentence enumerated a series of verbs. Better: “The camp physician be- lieved the belt-tightening habit to be. . . .” Latter can also mean later, in time or sequence. It should not pertain to an ear- lier event. There should never be any doubt what latter refers to. See FOR- MER. 2. As pronoun The latter may be used without a noun; so may the former. An illustration of correct usage (though bad poetry): “Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water. The former fell down and broke his crown, and the latter came tumbling after.” Latter denotes the second of two things. It should not be used in the man- ner of the following passages. In ensuing weeks, Mr. Momper won from the environmentalists an agreement on three basic principles— the presence of the allies, legal ties to West Germany and the government’s monopoly on the legal use of force. The latter was a singularly West Berlin issue. If there are three principles, the third is not “the latter” but the third, or the last or the last of those or something similar. Among the items kept there are the diary of Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebels, an X-ray of Adolph Hitler’s skull and the first edition of Pravda, the newspaper of the Soviet Communist Party. The latter is so rare that even Soviet officials don’t have an original; they had to photocopy the Hoover Institu- tion’s edition. Change “latter” to last or last of those or—best of all —newspaper. (Two names are misspelled: Goebbels and Adolf. And “edition” at the end should be copy. ) Latter is commonly used—or mis- used—to avoid repeating something. Many journalists are averse to repeti- tion. But repetition is not necessarily bad. There is nothing wrong with re- peating a word or short phrase to be clear or grammatical. D’Amato owns [?] the Republican, Conservative and Right to Life lines, and the latter got more than 130 , 000 votes in the 1978 gubernatorial elec- tion, displacing the Liberals as the fourth strongest party in the state. Replacing the erroneous “latter” with last-named or the like would correct the error. A better solution is to turn the sen- tence into two sentences. End the first with “lines.” Start the second: “The Right to Life Party got. . . .” The writer of the next sample seems baffled by grammar as she switches chaotically between the comparative and the superlative in a book on calligraphy: It [vermilion] is obtainable in sev- eral shades—in vermilion, scarlet ver- milion, orange vermilion and Chinese vermilion; this latter, being the deepest shade, is considered the more reliable. 208 latter 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 208"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Change “latter” to last and “more” to most. 3. With number Use of the latter implies the existence of the former, in the same category. If you speak of the latter choice, you are implicitly distinguishing it from the for- mer choice. Similarly, if you speak of the latter three (days, games, etc.), there must be the former three. This passage, from a news article, contains an illogicality: . . . He [President Bush] would permit abortion only in cases in which a con- tinued pregnancy would threaten the life of the mother, or when a preg- nancy results from rape or incest. But he has also said that he opposes the use of federal funds in the latter two cases. “The latter two cases” would be proper if one could speak of “the former two cases,” but only three categories are mentioned altogether. The writer would have done well to grit his teeth and re- peat three words: “in rape or incest cases.” LAUDABLE and LAUDATORY. See Confusing pairs. Law, courts, legal terms.

LAY and LIE. You lay your pen down. You lie in bed. The verb lay is transitive. (That is, it transmits the action from subject to ob- ject; and the object is essential for the verb to have full meaning.) The verb lie is intransitive. (It does not transmit the action. Just the subject par- ticipates in the action.) Thus a U.S. president spoke ungram- matically when he declared that “a new world of freedom lays before us.” It lies before us. A manual said incorrectly that envelopes “should lay flat.” They should lie flat. A newspaper columnist was wrong to write, “I was laying on my back. . . .” She was lying on her back. Lying was needed also in radio and TV reports of a truck “laying there on its side” and a crime victim “laying in the street.” There are a few exceptions to the rule that lay is a transitive verb. A hen can lay and a sailor can lay aft, for example. But lie is always intransitive. The past tense of lay is laid; the par- ticiples are laid (never “lain”) and lay- ing. Examples: I laid my pen down yesterday. I have (or had) laid it down often. I am laying it down now. Lie becomes lay, lain (never “laid”), and lying. Examples: I lay down last evening. I have (or had) lain on the bed occasionally. I am lying on it now. “He lied down,” a radio host said in- correctly. He lay down. Lied is the past tense of lie (verb) in another sense: to tell a lie, a falsehood. LAY OFF and LAYOFF. “. . . Man- agement still planned to layoff Teamster delivery drivers”; so said an article (by two writers quoting “sources” quoting a union representative quoting a manage- ment negotiator). It was in error: man- lay off and layoff 209 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 209"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"agement would not “layoff” anyone. The correct verb is lay off, two words. Layoff as a single word is a noun only, for example: “The layoff of workers will start next week.” The verb (transitive) has two words: “The company will lay off workers starting next week” or “Workers will start being laid off next week.” To lay off someone is to suspend or discharge him from employment for an impersonal economic reason. To discharge, dismiss, or fire an em- ployee is to stop employing him, usually for cause, such as performance on the job. In that sense, fire is an informal verb, probably originating in a humor- ous analogy with discharge; both also mean to shoot a gun. A layoff used to occur typically during a slow period for an industry or at a troubled time for a particular company, and it was often temporary. Now its only reason may be to save money, and it is usually permanent. When not describing lingerie, pink slip is a colloquial term for a notice of layoff, dating from the 1920 s. See also LET GO. LEAD (noun). While the television screen depicted a group of miners at work, an announcer remarked that for a century “Idaho has been producing lead for pencils or whatever else lead is used for.” He thereby publicly announced his ignorance of the difference between a pencil’s graphite, a form of carbon that is colloquially called “lead,” and the real lead, a metal used in alloys, bullets, pip- ing, printing type, and so on. Both are elemental substances and both are pro- nounced LED, but the similarity ends there. A writer for a metropolitan newspa- per also confused the two: What if they come out with a study that claims the best way to fight cholesterol is to pump more lead in your diet? Pretty soon people would be toss- ing their oat bran in the trash and chewing on No. 2 pencils. At a time when warnings about lead and health are common, the first sentence leads us to thoughts of the metal. Only when we read to the last word of the sec- ond sentence do we realize that the writer had a different “lead” in mind. (Among shortcomings is an inconsis- tency in mood. Either change “come . . . claims . . . is” to came, claimed, and was [subjunctive], or change “would” to will [indicative]. See Mood; Subjunctive. By the way, why would people necessarily pick the No. 2 pencils? I prefer the No. 1 .) See also LEAD (verb) and LED. LEAD (verb) and LED. An other- wise tightly written novel contains this sentence: “Pierce Bascomb lead the way up a slight hill and then down another.” Bascomb “ led the way.” The past tense of the common verb lead— pronounced LEED and meaning to direct, go first, or be the head of—is led and only led, pronounced LED. The same goes for the past participle: She has led the cause for years. He had led the army to defeat. An article in a legal newspaper quotes a lawyer as telling the Supreme Court that “jurors could be mislead by the anti-sympathy instruction.” Evidently a thought of lead, the metal, pronounced LED, misled the writer. There is an uncommon verb lead, pro- nounced LED and meaning to put lead in or on; or, in traditional printing, to create spaces by placing lead strips be- tween lines of type. Its past tense and past participle is leaded. See also Homophones; LEAD (noun). LEAP, LEAPED, LEAPT.

LECTERN and PODIUM. The stand for a speaker’s notes or papers is a lectern. In a broadcast, an autobiogra- phy, and a grammar, it was confused with something else seen in an audito- rium: We want to return to the podium for this evening’s featured speakers. . . . When I walked into the audito- rium . . . to meet the press for the first time, I noticed that the thirty or so mi- crophones on the podium left me no room for my notes. . . .

LEGEND, LEGENDARY. 1. Ambi- guity. 2. Before and after. 3. Other meanings. 1. Ambiguity The trouble with the contemporary practice of applying “legend” or “leg- endary” to real people or activities is that it has created ambiguity and threat- ened a distinctive pair of words. Now we cannot always be sure whether a user is talking about fact or fiction. A book (which purports to clarify words) tells us that “Too often a name is legendary” while few people know about the person. The same book says: It was a legendary television talk- show host who once said of his nightly performance, “I just keep talk- ing until I have something to say.” . . . The British upper-class stam- mer (or traulism) is a legendary man- nerism. Does “legendary” imply that the person, the story, and the stammer are of doubt- ful authenticity? Or is “legendary” sim- ply the author’s synonym for famous? 2. Before and after In the BC era—before corruption — legendary (adjective) primarily pertained to a legend (noun): a traditional story, usually about a famed personage, that was popularly believed to have a factual basis but could not be accepted as histor- ical fact. It might be partly true or wholly fictional. Examples are the leg- ends of Don Juan, Saint Nicholas, and King Arthur. Longfellow wrote: “Listen to this Indian legend / To this Song of Hi- awatha!” Then someone was described as being so famous that he was “a legend in his own time.” A strikingly fresh phrase at first, it became a cliché. After a while “in his own time” began to be dropped. When a baseball player changed teams, a big headline said “A legend de- parts.” A blurb for a book on science called one of its authors “a teaching leg- end,” and the author wrote that “leg- endary chefs of the past have gone to thirteen doublings” (of dough in making noodles). The introduction of another science book said, “Stephen Hawking was a legend even then.” On TV news: “His [David Packard’s] story is leg- endary and it all began here. . . .” A mag- legend, legendary 211 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 211"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"azine said, “Senator Robert Byrd . . . is legendary for directing wasteful spend- ing in West Virginia.” To another maga- zine, “ ‘Louie, Louie’ . . . is one of the most legendary songs in music history.” And a newspaper told “a story that be- came an instant Broadway legend” (about a Sondheim show). The language has plenty of synonyms for famous and famous person. It cannot afford to lose legendary and legend. 3. Other meanings A legend is also an inscription on an object like a coin or monument; a tablet or identification accompanying an ex- hibit or picture; or a key to symbols used in a map or chart. Legend, not preceded by an article, denotes a body or collection of popular stories handed down from earlier eras; or myth or traditional story in general; or popular belief as distinct from fact or scholarship. In the distant past, a legend was sup- posed to represent historical truth. It was a medieval story of the life of a saint; a collection of stories about saints or other admirable figures; or in general an ac- count or history of a person’s life. LENIENCY. See MERCY and PITY. “LEPT.” See LEAP, LEAPED, LEAPT. LESS. See FEWER and LESS. LESSER, LESSOR, and LESSEE. See Homophones. LET GO. As a verb phrase meaning to terminate employment, let go suits infor- mal contexts, unlike an article in a news- paper’s normally staid financial section. It reported that the news division of a broadcasting company, to cut costs, “let many senior people like Mr. P—— go.” Obviously they did not want to go. To say they were “let” go when they were ousted from their jobs is euphemistic. See also LAY OFF and LAYOFF. The main standard meanings of let go are to release from confinement (“Let my people go”), to release one’s hold (“He let go [or “let go of”] the rope”) and to abandon or relinquish (“Ah, take the cash and let the credit go”). LET, LET’S. 1. LEAVE and LET. 2. “LET’S DON’T.” 3. With pronouns. 1. LEAVE and LET The chorus of a once-popular song presents the words “leave me alone” a dozen times. It reflects a widespread us- age. To leave one alone commonly means to refrain from disturbing the per- son. But some strict writers and speakers apply let alone to such a sense. For them, the meaning of leave alone is to go away and leave one in solitude. To say, for instance, “She wants to be left alone” instead of “ let alone” is not incorrect, but it can be ambiguous. Does she want to be alone or does she just want to be undisturbed? Unless the con- text makes it clear, distinguishing be- tween let and leave (or left, its past tense and past participle) can be useful. Leave, aside from its companionship with alone, should never be substituted for let in the sense of allow or permit. “Leave” is improper in such sentences as “Let us be merry” / “Let me go” / “Let it cook” / “Let John speak.” 2. “LET’S DON’T” A letter to the editor of a financial newspaper was headed “Let’s Don’t En- danger the Truth.” To demonstrate why “Let’s Don’t” is bad English, we expand the contractions, producing “Let Us Do Not.” The editor who wrote the head- line could have either omitted the “Let’s” (“Don’t Endanger the Truth”) or changed the “Don’t” to Not (“Let’s Not Endanger the Truth”) without endanger- ing the English language. 212 leniency 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 212"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"Sometimes the first two words are switched around: “Don’t let’s take a chance.” It suits only casual conversa- tion. Let us not or let’s not is the pre- ferred phrase. 3. With pronouns No one is likely to say, “Let I decide.” Mistakes are liable to enter when an- other noun or pronoun is introduced. After the verb let, any personal pronoun has to be objective, not subjective (nomi- native): “Let Agnes and me [not “I”] fin- ish it.” / “Let you and him [not “he”] make the arrangements.” / “Let him and her [not “he and she”] know.” See also Pronouns, 10. These are right: “Let us walk” / “Let’s walk” / “Let you and me walk” / “Let’s all walk.” But “Let’s you and me walk” and “Let’s all of us walk” are redundant sentences. LIABLE. This adjective primarily means legally bound or responsible, or obligated by law: “One who lies under oath is liable to prosecution.” / “The jury found the driver liable for Smith’s injuries.” / “Parents are liable for the support of minor children.” In addition, liable means susceptible to something undesirable; or likely to do, experience, or be exposed to it. “Ac- cidents are liable to occur in this storm.” / “Your house is liable to be flooded.” / “We’re liable to get complaints.” In its first edition, The Random House Dictionary said, “LIABLE should not be used to mean ‘probable’ ” in place of “the true meaning, susceptibility to something unpleasant, or exposure to risk.” The second edition says “LIABLE is often interchangeable with LIKELY . . . where the sense is that of probability.” Its example is “The Sox are liable (or likely) to sweep the series”—but liable would be wrong on the basis of the re- striction in the first edition; likely would be right. Likely does mean probable or proba- bly going (to be, do, have, happen, etc.). It does not in itself suggest unpleasant- ness; its context may or may not. Likely is more general than liable or apt and can often substitute for either. Apt is similar to liable. It suggests not only that unpleasantness is likely but also that a bent or characteristic of the subject is contributing to the outcome, and it carries a hint of apprehension by the speaker. “He’s apt to pick a fight” but “She’s likely to receive a big ova- tion.” / “The old tire is apt to blow out soon” but “This new tire is likely to last for years.” LIBEL and SLANDER. An untrue communication about someone that in- jures his reputation or holds him up to hatred, contempt, or ridicule is a defamation. When the defamation is ex- pressed in writing or print, it is libel. When it is spoken, it is slander. Journalists should know all that. Yet a newspaper headline read, “Hughes ru- ined me—Maheu tells libel jury.” The jury found that Howard Hughes had de- famed his former assistant in a news conference conducted by telephone. The suit was not for “libel” but for slander. See also ACCUSED, ALLEGED (etc.); Guilt and innocence, 5; Quotation prob- lems, 1. LIE. See LAY and LIE. LIFE EXPECTANCY and LIFE SPAN. It is a fairly common miscon- ception that a long life span is a modern phenomenon and that in past centuries people did not live to ripe old ages. A statistical misunderstanding and a con- fusion of terms both appear to be at the bottom of it. It is written that two centuries ago the average life expectancy, at least in some countries, may have been in the thirties. Some forget that such an average in- life expectancy and life span 213 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 213"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"cludes a high infant mortality rate and deadly childhood diseases. One who sur- vived the first decade might expect a half-century more of life. Some individu- als lived even longer. In the fifth century B . C . the Greek writer Sophocles lived to about ninety when the average life ex- pectancy was probably in the twenties. This passage by a prominent writer of popular science, who must have under- stood the statistics, uses the term “life span” loosely: . . . Until the coming of modern medicine human beings did not have a long life span on the average. Most people, even in comparatively good times, were dead of violence or infec- tious disease before they were 40 . . . . . . . The average human life span has reached 75 , in many parts of the world. . . . Change “span” to expectancy. Students of longevity distinguish between life ex- pectancy and life span. Life expectancy is the number of years that a newborn or an individual of a given age in a particular population is expected to live, based on statistical probability and the likelihood of mortal illness or trauma. Life span is the maximum number of years that a human being or animal can live under ideal conditions, in the ab- sence of illness or trauma. The human life span is not known, but one authority estimates it to be 120 . See also Numbers, 10E. LIGATION and LITIGATION. A woman calling a radio talk show said that mothers on welfare should be forced to have “tubal litigation.” Litiga- tion, pronounced lit-ih-GAY-shun, is a legal action or the carrying on of legal action. Although intending to sic the doctors, not the lawyers, on the hapless mothers, the caller put an extra syllable in ligation. Pronounced lie-GAY-shun, it means an act of binding, a state of being bound, or a thing that binds. In medicine it is the application of a ligature, LIG-a- choor, any material that is tied around a blood vessel or other structure to con- strict it. To so tie the part is to ligate it, LIE-gate. Tubal in the context of ligation pertains to the Fallopian tubes. A word that looks similar is legation, lih-GAY-shun, a diplomatic establish- ment in a foreign country, below the sta- tus of an embassy; also a mission on which an envoy of the pope is sent. LIGHTENING and LIGHT- NING. See Confusing pairs. LIGHT YEAR. What is wrong with this statement (by a national press ser- vice)? On Aug. 23 , the telescope’s faint- object camera took an image of super- nova 1987 a, a star that exploded about 160 , 000 light years from Earth in February 1987 . The latter half of the statement is impos- sible. It takes about 160 , 000 years for light to reach us from that distance. If the “star . . . exploded” in 1987 , nobody would know about the explosion until approximately the year 161 , 987 . It is more likely that 1987 was simply the year in which telescopes picked up the event. In that case, it must have occurred about 160 , 000 years before, in approxi- mately the year 158 , 013 B . C . A light year, or light-year, is the dis- tance that light travels through space in a year, at its speed of about 186 , 000 miles per second: about 5 . 878 trillion ( 5 . 878 × 10 12 ) miles.

Depending on the answer, one might either (a) change “like” to unlike or (b) place “Like his predecessor” first, followed by a comma. An alternative way to correct the exam- ple is to change the comma to a period and start a new sentence: “His predeces- sor was. . . .” See also NOT, 1C, E. A fear of misusing like leads occasion- ally to an ambiguous use of as. See AS and LIKE, 1. 2. Incomparability Like primarily likens one thing to an- other. The things need to have a similar- ity, albeit not the equivalence of a mathematical equation. A weekly’s review of a recording pur- ports to equate a voice with certain people: Like all great hip-hop MCs, Keith’s voice has natural personality. It seems to say that the man’s voice is like masters of ceremony. They are not com- patible ideas. Change one or the other; for instance: A. “Like the voices of all great hip- hop MCs, Keith’s voice has natural personality.” Here voice is like voices. B. “Like all great hip-hop MCs, Keith has a voice with natural person- ality.” Here person is like persons. A news story of a (revised) theory by two geochemists about a prehistoric col- lision is headed: Asteroid once rocked Earth like 10 , 000 megatons of TNT The headline seems to say that what an extraterrestrial body did (verb) equaled an explosive force (noun). The ideas are at odds. Among possible corrections: “ Force of asteroid crash was / like . . .” Now one force is likened to another. An alternative: “Asteroid hit Earth with force / of 10 , 000 megatons of TNT.” A large daily almost gets it right but appears to go astray: Like most of the other successful farmers on formerly Mfengu land, he struggled at first and later was di- vorced by his wife during the hard times. It is right through “he struggled at first.” End the sentence there—unless most of the man’s colleagues were divorced by their wives too—and start a new sen- tence: “His wife divorced him. . . .” See also AS and LIKE, 2; UNLIKE. 3. Sense and senselessness Like, while a legitimate word, is per- haps used more often in a slang sense or senselessly. In standard usage, like, as a preposi- tion, means similar to (“She’s like a doll”), similarly to (“He worked like a horse”), in the usual manner of (“It’s just like him to joke about it”); desirous of (“I feel like eating”), or indicative of (“It looked like rain”). Like, as an adjective, means equal or similar (“three pounds of potatoes and a like amount of carrots”); as a noun, something similar (with the: “squirrels, chipmunks, gophers, and the like”); or, as a verb, to be fond of (“I like Mike”). Like, the preposition, can also mean for example, for instance, or such as. Sometimes it is redundantly used with one of those expressions. A columnist in a television panel spoke of the weighty issues that the president was attending to, “like, for instance, the poison gas treaty.” Either like or for instance would have been enough. While not a conjunction in strict us- age, like often is casually used in place of as or as if. A correction is inserted in each of these remarks: “Like [ as ] I told the team, ‘Keep gnawing at ’em. . . .’ ” / like 215 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 215"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"“It was like [ as if ] she had been picked up and put there.” The distinction is covered in AS and LIKE. Like figures in various informal ex- pressions: “like a bat out of hell,” very fast; “like crazy,” wildly or violently; “like hell,” never, not at all, strongly, or rapidly; “like a hole in the head,” not at all (needed); “like a million bucks,” very good (looking); “like there’s no tomor- row,” avidly; and so on. On a still lower level, it substitutes for approximately (“It lasts like three hours”), for example (“They have like steaks there”), perhaps (“They went, like, to the store”), and unfortunately (“I accidentally, like, broke the dish”). The word serves also as a verbal crutch, in the manner of a pause or a grunt. (“Mary doesn’t want to, like, come.” / “He was, like, terrific.”) Like undergoes further maltreatment in a faddish replacement of I think, I thought, she said, he said, etc. An actress displayed minimal artistry when script- less in a television interview: I just came from a big dinner and I’m like I shouldn’t have had that wine. . . . He said, “How much?” I’m like okay. And a university student showed limited grasp of his language in a magazine in- terview: There are days where I’m like, “Oh, my God, I’m so happy I’m living the life I’m living.” . . . And I’m like, “What if they offer me this job?” . . . To my dad, I’d be like, “I gotta find myself. . . .” “Like” could have been removed from each of the following remarks without any loss of meaning: [The student again:] OK, like, here’s the deal. . . . Like, how can I start working when I don’t know who I am yet[?]. [A man praising a car for a commer- cial:] You are [able to go] from zero to like sixty in no time.

One word does not be- long in the following sentence, from a book: Gelett Burgess, who invented the word “blurb” and was the creator of the limerick about “the purple cow,” once tried to smuggle “huzzlecoo,” a word he coined, into English. “The Purple Cow” by Burgess is a qua- train, a verse, a nonsense poem—but not a “limerick.” Here it is: I never saw a purple cow, I never hope to see one; But I can tell you, anyhow, I’d rather see than be one! A limerick is not just any humorous verse, but one with five lines and a strict form. Many are ribald. This one is not: A flea and a fly in a flue Were imprisoned, so what could they do? Said the flea, “Let us fly!” Said the fly, “Let us flee!” So they flew through a flaw in the flue. (Technically, the first, second, and fifth lines of a limerick have three feet each; the third and fourth lines have two feet each.

To limp (verb, intransitive) is to walk unevenly, haltingly, or as one walks with a lame leg or foot: favoring the other. The first time some writer tried out the word in describing a disabled ship or airplane, it may have been an effective metaphor. Now that innumerable craft have been limping about in the press for decades, it has turned into a lame cliché. A newspaper’s use is typical: Later, planes limped back from a dozen secret arms drops inside Nicaragua on one engine, with smoke and oil spewing behind. In the following passage, from a book of true adventure, the word is turned into a transitive verb. . . . As I hurtled along at full power into lift-off, the motor spluttered and one cylinder conked out. . . . We limped the plane back to the apron.

LITERALLY. Picture the amazing sight described by this headline: Literally waltzing on air Jesse Winchester comes to town A television commentator described another weird phenomenon. We’ve seen in this election Ronald Reagan literally change his spots in front of our eyes. Maybe Mr. Reagan’s special-effects de- partment was responsible for that. Any- way, as president he discovered that people were starving in national parks. When we took office, we found that . . . the funding for the maintenance and upkeep of our parks had been lit- erally a starvation diet. One day a gunman invaded the Senate and demanded the approval of stopgap funds before midnight. A senator was quoted as saying on the Senate floor: We are literally here today with a gun to our heads. The senators acquiesced and were spared. But another culprit (we learn from TV news) was not at all merciful. . . . He literally made a killing in oil and real estate stocks. How he perpetrated the deed was not spelled out. Possibly he smothered his victim in a mound of stock certificates. Because all those things happened lit- erally, you could see them actually hap- pen. No metaphor was intended. No imagination was shown. Words were used in their strictest senses. literally 217 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 217"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Had people been speaking poetically or metaphorically or with imagination, they would not have said literally. And, if they had any concern that their figura- tive statements would be taken as literal truth, they might have explained that they meant “figuratively a starvation diet” or “figuratively here today with a gun to our heads” or “figuratively made a killing.” Poets do not require such explanation for their metaphors, like this one: “Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player / That struts and frets his hour upon the stage.” Shakespeare had no need for fig- uratively or, heaven knows, for “liter- ally.” LITIGATION.

Adjective: LIVE and ALIVE The adjective live (rhyming with dive ) is not interchangeable with alive, al- though both primarily mean possessing life. “These are live flowers” but “The flowers are alive. ” In that sense, live goes before the noun; alive goes after the noun. In certain, technical senses, live may either precede or follow the noun: “This is a live broadcast” or “The broadcast is live, ” meaning it is being made now, not transmitted from a recording. “It’s a live wire” or “The wire is live, ” meaning it is carrying electric current. 2. Verb: LIVE with IN This section deals with the verb live, rhyming with give. An editor wrote, “So it might be the one place I’ll ever live that hasn’t been ‘discovered.’ ” You do not live a place. You cannot live Chicago but can live in it. Correction: “place I’ll ever live in ” or “place in which I’ll ever live.” The verb live is intransitive in the sense of reside and in most other senses. It is transitive when it means to spend (one’s life) in a particular way or to carry out (something) in one’s life: “He lived a celibate life” / “They live their religion.” LIVID. Bluish in the shade of a bruise or in any other dull hue is the primary meaning of livid, just as it was of lividus in Latin. Some people mistakenly identify livid with another primary color, red, and the second Random House Dictionary rub- ber-stamps that misunderstanding. This odd distortion of recent years may have come about in these steps: from blue to grayish-blue, to gray, to pale-faced, to pale with anger, to very angry, to flushed with anger, to red. Livid in the sense of very angry is termed colloquial by The Oxford En- glish Dictionary. It is common in the news media. A four-word paragraph in a newspaper: “Environmental groups were livid” (when Congress refused to support a desert preserve). A quotation from a recording-academy president, in another paper: the trustees “were just livid about the situation” (the discovery that a prize-winning duo did not sing). LOATH and LOATHE. A com- puter magazine was discussing desktop publishing programs: PageMaker users who find their pro- gram to be simple will be loathe to tread in new waters. “Loathe” was wrong. Adding e to loath (presumably by the article’s two writers) was a mistake. Loath (adjective) means reluctant, un- willing. You should be loath to add an- other letter to it. (Sometimes a letter is 218 litigation 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 218"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"taken away: loth is found in some old lit- erature.) To loathe (verb, transitive) is to hate intensely, to abhor, to detest. This one has the e— as in e nemy. The words appear to have in common an ancient, Teutonic root meaning to hate. LONGSHOREMAN. See STEVE- DORE and LONGSHOREMAN. LOOSE and LOSE. The (transitive) verbs loose and lose sometimes are con- fused. The former, pronounced LOOS, means to let loose, to release, or to make less strict. “Did he loose the boat from its moorings?” The latter, pronounced LOOZ, means to suffer the loss of, to be deprived of, or to be defeated. “Don’t lose your ticket.” A passage from a book about books is followed by part of a testimonial for a gymnasium in a published ad: A bright, colorful, attractive cover can only increase the sales of a publica- tion. A poorly designed cover will loose sales. I always wanted to loose weight and become stronger. “Loose” is almost the reverse of what both excerpts need: lose. The past tense and past participle of loose is loosed; of lose is lost. A verb sim- ilar to loose is loosen, meaning (transi- tive) to make looser; past tense and past participle: loosened. (The three verbs have intransitive senses also.) LOOT. A radio report said, regarding the theft of money from a truck wrecked in an accident, “Attempts are ongoing to identify others who helped themselves to the loot.” To the money. It was not “loot” before it was stolen. ( See also ONGOING. ) To use “loot” as slang for money or valuables is not advisable, unless in pri- vate conversation. The owner may ob- ject to seeing or hearing what he owns associated with a word for stolen goods. The noun loot, acquired directly from Hindi, originally meant the booty or spoils of war or pillaging. Now it can also be any goods or money stolen or ap- propriated dishonestly: “The burglars hid their loot in the cellar.” It can also be the act of plundering: “He was accused of the loot of the treasury.” Loot is also a verb (transitive and in- transitive), meaning to plunder. “The army looted the town.” LOSE. See LOOSE and LOSE. LOT. 1. Meaning MANY or MUCH. 2. Two words. 1. Meaning MANY or MUCH Using a lot (of) to mean much or many used to be generally considered just colloquial, and some writers still avoid it in serious writing, although oth- ers use it without hesitation. The same is true of lots (of), a synonym. A reporter said on national television, alluding to statements by Republican election campaigners: A lot of people is saying, “We’re talk- ing about matters of trust.” “People is saying”? The reporter would probably not announce that “many people is saying.” A “lot” is not speak- ing; people are. In that context a lot (of) means many. A lot (of) can mean much. “A lot of money is invested in the project.” The verb is singular because “money” is sin- gular. Similarly, lots (of) can mean many or much. In other senses, a lot is a piece of land; an object used for random choosing, as lot 219 02-F–L_4 10/22/02 10:30 AM Page 219"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"in, “We’ll draw lots”; and a number of people or things considered as a group, as in “They’re a sorry lot” and “How much for the lot?” One’s lot is one’s for- tune in life. 2. Two words “There’s no need for ice or a glass, you can buy it almost anywhere, and it’s the kind of thing you want to drink alot of,” Sousa added. The first time you see that four-letter anomaly in a newspaper, you can dismiss it as a typesetter’s error. Perhaps he for- got to put a space between the a and lot in a lot. But in the next paragraph, it ap- pears again, twice: “Although wine is also cheap, if you drink alot of wine, you are called a wino; but if you drink alot of beer, you’re just a big macho,” Sousa said. After three appearances of the bar- barism, it becomes apparent that the re- porter did not know any better. If an editor examined the copy at all, he did not know enough to correct it. Possibly a vague memory of the word allot (verb), meaning to apportion, had played a part in the muddling. The interviewed man would deserve sympathy if he were not an advertising executive who probably welcomed the free publicity for his client, notwithstanding a lot of errors. LTD., LIMITED. See FIRM.

MAJORITY and PLURALITY An error in word usage can amount to a factual error, as in this passage from a local newspaper: All that was needed to win the elec- tion to replace Horcher was a simple majority and, according to tallies, the top vote-getter was Republican Gary Miller, who will take office immedi- ately upon certification of the elec- tion. . . . Miller . . . garnered 18 , 304 votes, or 40 percent, in the field of six candi- dates. If Miller won with 40 percent, he did not have a “simple majority”—or any other majority. He had a plurality. A majority is at least half of the votes cast plus one. If three or more candi- dates run and none gets more than 50 percent of the total vote, the highest number of votes is a plurality. Under many election laws, a plurality is enough to win. Others require a ma- jority to win, and if no candidate gets it in the main election, those with the two highest totals compete in a run-off. 2. Singular or plural? A network’s chief anchor man was re- porting from South Africa, using a verb inconsistently: The vast majority of black students “is” undereducated. The majority of blacks “are” under twenty- one. “Is” is incorrect. Are is correct. If majority signifies a particular num- ber or a numerical superiority as such, it gets a singular verb. “The majority was only three votes.” If majority signifies the larger of two groups, the verb may be singular or plu- ral. It depends on what the speaker or writer has in mind. When the group’s unity is emphasized, the verb is singular. “The majority stands solidly behind the bill.” But when majority refers to most individuals in a category, the verb is plu- ral. “The vast majority of black students are undereducated.” This passage is from a special article in a financial newspaper: Many middle-ranking Chinese offi- cers have expressed fears of a civil war because recent events have in- creased the divisions within the army. But the majority believes that the re- sult will be not an army split, but an army controlled by the hard-lin- ers. . . . majority 221 M 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 221"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Change “believes” to believe. “Many . . . officers” foresee a split.

The combining form -man- means human being. It is found in words like mankind and manslaughter, as a prefix; and freeman and woman, as a suffix. The plural of the suffix is -men. Woman came from the Old English wifman, from wif, meaning female or woman, and man, meaning human be- ing (the meaning of manu in Sanskrit). The other meaning of man, that of an adult male, developed later. The sense of man as human being or humanity is reflected in the Biblical line So God created man in his own image . . . male and female created he them. and in a passage by the philosopher David Hume: There is in all men, both male and fe- male, a desire and power of genera- tion more active than is ever universally exerted. Similarly, Jefferson’s line in the Declara- tion of Independence that “all men are created equal” refers to all people. Man retains that meaning to this day. Man cannot live by bread alone. Man’s inhumanity to man. Man’s best friend. The dawn of man. God or man. Man or beast. Man overboard! That millennia-old syllable was threatened in the sixties and seventies when a radical movement arose to fix what was unbroken and break what was fixed. The mistaken belief that -man- meant male, coupled with the perverse notion that masculinity was ipso facto bad, gave rise to several circumlocutions. They pollute the language to this day. One of them has been to substitute other words, no matter how unidiomatic or lu- dicrous the result. Taking politic license, a book reviewer wrote: It’s a visiting firefighter type that drew understandable derision from Safer and other correspondents sta- tioned in Saigon at the time .... “Firefighter” stands out embarrassingly. Although that word may be an accept- able job title, the expression that the re- viewer corrupted is visiting fireman. It means a visitor who is catered to because of his importance or money. Some have chosen to change mankind to the windier humankind, unaware that human derives from the Latin homo, meaning man or a man. Another circumlocution has been to drop -man: to give a chairman the name of a piece of furniture, a “chair.” ( See CHAIR. ) Then there are the “person” and “people” monstrosities, in which the of- fending monosyllable in almost any word is replaced with a disyllable. For example, manhole gets corrupted to “personhole,” airman to “airperson,” and congressmen to “congresspersons” or “congresspeople.” ( See PERSON; PEOPLE as a suffix; SPOKESMAN. ) Turning woman into “woperson” has even been suggested. Unfortunately for male-haters, person has a -son. A few choose to misspell woman “womyn,” as if to fool the English-speakers of the world. The words virtual, virtue, and virtu- oso do stem from the Latin word for a male, but thus far there has been no movement to resist them. See VIRTUE. MANNER and MANOR.

MANY and MUCH. “You won’t get much extra sales if you throw in a pencil with every purchase of a car,” says a book on marketing. Change “much” to many: “many extra sales. . . .” Use much when you talk about a large amount of something (“much money”) or a large degree (“much wisdom”) or a large extent (“much devastation”). It goes with a singular noun. Use many when you talk about a large number of things (“many trees” / “many people” / “many sales”). It goes with a plural noun. Occasionally, in a more or less poetic vein, many is followed by a or an and a singular noun. “And many an eye has danced to see that banner in the sky.” The meaning of many remains the same: a large number of things, though repre- sented by one thing. In that construction, any verb should be singular, e.g., “ has danced.” The nar- rator of a travel series on television erred in saying, “Many an amusing anecdote have been born” on a railway. It has been born. In a more common construc- tion, the verb is indeed plural: “Many amusing anecdotes have been born” / “Many brave hearts are asleep in the deep.” See also MUCH. MARGINAL, MARGINALLY. In general, marginal (adjective) pertains to a margin (noun). A margin is an edge or border of something. It can be literal, as the margin of a page; or figurative, as a margin for error or the line between be- ing able or willing to carry out an activ- ity and not. The terms are used in various ways in business and economics. We may regard margin as the line between being in the black and being in the red. A marginal business barely meets its costs. The re- ceipts for a marginal product barely cover the cost of production. A producer in that situation operates marginally (ad- verb). Writers and speakers in the popular media often use “marginal(ly)” when all they mean is small, slight(ly), a little— or any of numerous synonyms. Perhaps they think that it has a more learned ring to it. A columnist wrote: Mr. Marchais has presided over a de- cline of the French Communists’ vote by well over half, from a powerful force that blocked alternating politics to a marginal role on the national scene. If she meant a small, slight, or modest role, she could well have said so. Here is a part of a news dispatch from Luxembourg: . . . Appreciation of the United States is overshadowed these days by ner- vous talk of sabotage and snubs in this bucolic land, which is marginally smaller than Rhode Island. “Marginally smaller” is better changed to “ somewhat smaller” or “ a little smaller.” A still better way is to be spe- cific: “ 18 percent smaller.” A report said that ten staff members of a university had found a management training program to be “a beneficial ex- perience, but only marginally so.” That roundabout wording—apparently laud- atory at first but reversing course mid- way—could perhaps have been boiled down to “a slightly [or “ barely ”] benefi- cial experience.” MARIJUANA. Marijuana, some- times spelled marihuana, is a complex drug produced from the Cannabis sativa plant and used illicitly, usually by smok- ing, for its intoxicating effect. It consists of any part of the plant that has been prepared for smoking, primarily by dry- marijuana 223 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 223"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"ing. Containing at least 426 compounds, it produces thousands more when burned. These headlines distorted the facts: U.S. OK’s marijuana pills Legal marijuana capsules on way to 4 cancer victims The first story described the contents of the pills as “synthetic marijuana,” which is impossible. The second described the contents as “federally grown mari- juana,” which was erroneous. The pills contained no marijuana. Their active in- gredient was synthetic THC (delta- 9 - tetrahydrocannabinol). THC is the principal mind-affecting ingredient in marijuana but it is just one of the 426 compounds. Headlines like these went further in disseminating misinformation: Pot—a New Prescription for Cancer? Pot for cancer available “Pot,” which is slang for marijuana (as is “grass” / “weed” / “dope” / “herb” / “tea” / and “Mary Jane”), does not cure or ameliorate cancer and never has been used to treat cancer. Its smoking pro- vides no medical benefit that is recog- nized by the medical profession or the federal government and, according to thousands of scientific studies, causes many injurious effects. These effects in- clude transportation accidents, lung ail- ments, and probably cancer. Marijuana cigarettes and, more often, synthetic THC in capsule form were tried out as an antiemetic, a drug for curbing nausea and vomiting, in some patients taking anticancer drugs. The THC was found to be effective. In 1986 the federal government approved the commercial production, not of mari- juana, but of the encapsulated THC in an oil base (under the trade name Mari- nol) and its dispensation by prescription to cancer patients unresponsive to con- ventional antiemetics. MARSHAL. This word traces to the Old High German marahscalh, meaning horse servant. Originally a marshal was a groom, one who took care of horses. Later marshal was applied to the master of horses in a medieval royal household, then to the official in charge of military affairs for a sovereign. In various coun- tries today, a marshal is the highest ranking military commander or a com- mander of a particular military branch. In the United States, officers of different kinds bear the title marshal: one who carries out federal court orders; a munic- ipal functionary, such as a fire marshal; and the head of a parade. The verb marshal means (transitive) to arrange in order (“marshal the troops”); to direct as a marshal; to lead, someone, ceremoniously; to enlist and organize for action; or (intransitive) to take up positions in proper order, partic- ularly in military formation. The past tense or past participle is marshaled and the present participle is marshaling. The British prefer marshalled and mar- shalling. Whatever the meaning, the noun or basic verb marshal is properly spelled with one l and should not be confused with the name Marshall (as borne by two Supreme Court justices, a vice- president, and a general and statesman). Confuse them is what Webster’s Third Dictionary has done, indicating that the spelling is “also marshall. ” It is if you are a grade-F speller. Marshal is pronounced the same as martial, warlike or related to war. This adjective derives from the Latin mar- tialis, of Mars, the god of war. MASTERFUL and MASTERLY. When a political party spokesman told a 224 marshal 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 224"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"television audience that the president “has handled this crisis in a very master- ful fashion,” he was saying in effect that the president had acted in a very dictato- rial, arbitrary, domineering fashion, as a master acts toward a servant. Being of the same party as the president, the spokesman would not have uttered such a verity on purpose. Perhaps, had he known better, he would have used the word masterly, meaning like a master of a skill or discipline; possessing or ex- hibiting the ability, knowledge, or skill of a master. Centuries back, masterful and mas- terly were both used in either sense. The distinction between the two was a useful development, but there has been retro- gression. Now “masterful” is mistaken for masterly so often that modern dictio- naries have rubber-stamped the misuse and accepted it as a secondary meaning without comment, thus contributing to confusion rather than to clarity. Masterful is an adjective; masterfully is the related adverb. Masterly is both an adjective and an adverb. From an autobiography: “He gave a masterful speech, greeted by a thunder- ous ovation.” Befitting a foreign dictator, the sentence actually was meant to praise a U.S. president (another one). MATERIAL and MATERIEL. See Confusing pairs. MAXIMIZE. See -IZE ending, 1. MAY and MIGHT. 1. Fact versus supposition. 2. Other distinctions. 1. Fact versus supposition A comment by a government official that “The accident at St. Louis may have been prevented” was a mistake on its face. May have deals with fact, with what was possible. The speaker needed might have to express what was hypo- thetical, a supposition contrary to fact. To say “He may have won all four” tournaments, as a golf authority said of the late Ben Hogan, is tantamount to saying “I’m not sure if he won all four or not.” The intended meaning was “He might have won all four” had he played in them. The opposite error enters this sen- tence (from an article): Those in attendance last night, as well as a national cable audience, might have been years removed from the segregated world that Robinson chal- lenged in such a public, yet lonely, fashion. “Might” should be may, expressing what is possible. These two sentences illustrate correct uses of may and might with have: • “I may have attended the meeting, but I don’t remember if I did.” It discusses a question of fact, something that could have happened. • “I might have attended the meeting if my health permitted.” It deals with the hypothetical, presenting a supposition contrary to fact. See also Subjunctive. 2. Other distinctions These are some other distinctions be- tween the two words (used as auxiliary verbs): A. May, expressing permission in the pre- sent tense, as in “The boss says we may take the holiday off,” becomes might in the past tense: “The boss said we might take the holiday off.” B. May, expressing possibility in the pre- sent tense, as in “The Browns say they may buy a house,” becomes might in the past tense: “The Browns said they might buy a house.” may and might 225 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 225"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"C. Might can be used to express possibil- ity in the present tense: “She might sue him.” When it is used in that way, it is less forceful than may: “She may sue him”; the likelihood is greater here. D. May can express a purpose or result, in a clause beginning with that or so that: “I work hard so that my children may be cared for.” Might expresses a more forlorn hope: “We struggle that someday our people might be free.” E. Might in a courteous request as in “ Might I say something?” is weaker and hence more humble than may. MAYHEM. See Crimes, 4. MEAN (adjective). Mean in the sense of inhumane, malicious, or unkind often gets a tail these days, as in this snip from a movie review: “She is a mean- spirited, dishonest, highly judgmental in- dividual. . . .” Followers of the fad would not be satisfied to call Simon Legree mean; he was “mean-spirited.” The “-spirited” is not wrong, just often unnecessary. So far the appending has not extended to mean in the sense of humble, low- grade, paltry, or petty. MEAN (noun). Three books on word usage misleadingly define the sta- tistical term mean as “the midpoint” or “the middle point.” In addition, a book on press style calls mean “a figure inter- mediate between two extremes.” It gives 45 as the “mean temperature” between a high of 56 and a low of 34 . In a general sense, the noun mean does denote a middle point or medium. In a statistical sense, a mean, also known as an arithmetic mean or arithmetical mean, is what people commonly call an average. It is the sum of a set of figures di- vided by the number of figures in the set. The definitions coincide only for a set of two figures. The mean of 56 , 36 , and 34 is 42 . A statistical term in which the middle point is essential is median. It is a figure midway in a set of figures arranged in or- der of size. In the set of three just above, the median is 36 . (When the number of items is even, the median is the mean of the two figures in the middle.) Techni- cally, the mean and the median are both averages. ME and I. See Pronouns, 10. ME and MYSELF.

They are media of mass com- munication—and people in those media should know that, but not all of them do: [Radio:] They pulled it off secretly [setting a killer free on parole]. No media was on hand. [Television:] How well does the news media cover the story? [Newspaper:] However, in this gener- ation, the media is not so meek.

When bitten, the media has a habit of biting back. The quoted sentences may be corrected as follows: “No media were on hand” or “No news medium was on hand.” / “How well do the news media cover the story?” / “. . . The media are not so meek.” / “. . . The media have become too powerful . . . the media are fair . . . the media have a habit of biting back.” Media is a plural of medium. Except in sentences like that one and this one, media is improper in the singular. There is no such word as “medias.” Agencies of mass communication have become known as the mass media. Those agencies in general, or at times just the news media, are colloquially called the media. A talk show host used media wrong and right in the same sentence when a listener complained about excessive in- terest in O. J. Simpson. To some extent the media is responsi- ble, because they’re covering all of this. Make it “the media are responsible. . . .” They’re is correct. This sentence appears in a book, an- other mass medium: Direct marketing is not restricted to any one media. There cannot be “one media.” Make it “one medium. ” 2. Other MEDIUMS Mediums is another plural of medium and the only plural of the word when used in the sense of a person claiming the power to communicate with the de- ceased. “She is superstitious and has gone to fortune-tellers and mediums.” The use of media rather than medi- ums is more common in designating agencies of mass communication. A medium is also a means or instru- mentality through which an effect is pro- duced; an environment in which something exists and functions; or a nu- tritive substance in which organisms can grow. On a television news program, a physician tried to use the word in that last sense. It’s the water in the ear that makes a nice media for bacteria to grow. “Media” should have been put in the singular: “a nice medium. ” A medium is also something that is in- termediate between two extremes. It is like the more common medium (adjec- tive—the others are nouns), meaning in- termediate or average, as in “small, medium, and large sizes.” The last two mediums resemble the Latin medium, meaning middle, which English adopted. MEDIAN. See MEAN (noun). MEMORANDA and MEMO- RANDUM. A U.S. senator at a hear- ing kept referring to a written record as “a memoranda.” It was a memorandum. A participant in a television forum said, “North drew up memoran- das. . . .” They were memoranda or memorandums. Because memoranda is plural, “a memoranda” and “memorandas” are wrong. MERCY and PITY. Heavy rains had swelled streams and caused widespread flooding. When the deluge subsided, a banner headline across a newspaper’s front page read, unidiomatically: “Rivers take mercy.” It looked as though a confused editor had combined a part mercy and pity 227 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 227"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"of two common phrases: take pity and have mercy. Sometimes a creative writer departs from idiom, but a serious head- line calls for communication more than creativity, and the humanizing of rivers is literary license enough.

It can suggest ( 1 ) an extraordinary act of kindness, possi- bly toward someone whom one is in a position to harm; ( 2 ) compassionate treatment, such as the relief of suffering; or ( 3 ) an inclination to be kind, to for- give, or to pity. Often pity (noun) is less active. It denotes a feeling of sorrow, sympathy, or compassion for another’s misfortune or suffering. It may imply an attitude of condescension toward some- one considered inferior or weaker. Some words associated with mercy are charity, alms-giving, benevolence, or tolerance in judging one; clemency, a re- prieve or lenient act by someone in au- thority; and leniency, mildness in dispensing justice or administering rules. Some words associated with pity are compassion, sorrow for one’s suffering with a desire to help; commiseration, a feeling or expression of sympathy with a person in distress; condolence, an ex- pression of such sympathy; and sympa- thy, an understanding of and a sharing in one’s grief, pain, or other feelings.

Metaphoric contradiction. Instead of saying “What bad luck I’m having!” a poetically minded person might say “I am drowning in a sea of trouble.” The statement would be a metaphor, a figure of speech in which one thing is likened to another. Often a concrete object (e.g., the sea) is used to describe an abstraction (trouble). If that poet’s main trouble is a drought that has dried up his vegetable garden, his metaphor is compromised— or it does not hold water, to use another metaphor. If it stirs mirth in his listeners or readers, he has defeated his purpose. Thus one needs to think of the literal meaning of a metaphor before using it for a particular purpose. A newspaper story about health risks in restaurants pointed out that “a diner does not always know how long food has been sitting unrefrigerated” and it quoted thus a Food and Drug Adminis- tration spokesman: “If it’s lukewarm, they’re just playing with fire.” Calling for a vision of lukewarm fire, the metaphor fizzled. A news story about the tunnel under San Francisco Bay bore this lead: “BART will pull out all the stops today to try to locate the spot where water is still leaking into the trans-Bay tube at the rate of eight gallons an hour.” It made one want to dash into the offices of the Bay Area Rapid Transit and shout, “Wait! Don’t pull out the stops! Do you want to flood the tube?” The topic on a national TV news pro- gram was skin cancer. A physician said, when asked about the safety of the tan- ning salon: “If people use it, they should use it with their eyes open.” The inter- viewer missed a chance to ask: “Wouldn’t people be safer using it with their eyes closed?” Metaphors can be single words, just as they can be phrases. The same admo- nition applies. The task may be harder, inasmuch as the words are often used without regard to their literal meanings. A few examples: • Bottleneck— “The biggest bottleneck in housing” fails as a metaphor. Its purpose is to describe the worst 228 metal and mettle 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 228"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"problem, so an analogy would be the narrowest, most constricting bottleneck, not the biggest. • Breakdown— “The breakdown of patients by . . . departments . . . should be strictly followed.” / “The houses should be broken down into types.” Nobody is accused of promoting patient breakdowns in a hospital or broken-down houses in the real estate business, but classification or classified would have been preferable. • Depression— A board was urged to promote industrial development before “a depression . . . arises.” Literally a depression is a sunken area; to arise is to move upward. A related contradiction is the use of “as much as” together with “less.” See Numbers, 2 (end). • Inundate— Someone or something may be figuratively inundated, or flooded, but not by flames. See INUNDATE, INUNDATED. • Spawn— A newspaper reported that one conference had “spawned” (that is, prolifically given birth to) others throughout the state. The conferences dealt with the prevention of teenage pregnancy. See Double meaning. Two metaphoric words or expressions that are close by may contradict each other, even if they are individually satis- factory: “This is a virgin field, pregnant with possibilities” (a pregnant virgin?). “We must not allow ourselves to be stampeded into stagnation” (no place for a stampede). Additional examples of ludicrous metaphors are in BEGET; Cliché clash; LITERALLY. METEOR, METEORITE, and METEOROID. A television news man described sightings of a blue, scintil- lating object in the sky, attributing to the National Weather Service that “it proba- bly was a meteorite and it probably fell into the ocean.” Meteorites are not seen in the sky. A meteorite by definition is a body from space that has survived the trip to earth. While it was traveling through the earth’s atmosphere, it was a meteor. The term is applied also to the luminous streak produced by the meteor’s friction with the atmosphere. Before reaching the atmosphere, the object was a meteoroid, a small body that travels through outer space. A newspaper’s science writer was imprecise in writing: More precise radioactive dating methods have fixed the age of the old- est meteorites orbiting the Sun at about 4 . 53 billion years. Those bodies are meteoroids, not “mete- orites”—except in the loosest of lan- guage, unbefitting a science column. MIDNIGHT. See A.M., P.M., NOON, MIDNIGHT. MIGHT. See MAY and MIGHT. MILE. See KNOT.

To minimize something is to reduce it to a minimum (“We must minimize our cost”) or to place it at the lowest or smallest estimate (“I mini- mized my estimated tax”) or to make it appear as small or trifling as possible (“Smith, the attorney, minimized his client’s responsibility for the accident”). Minimize (verb, transitive) is an abso- lute term, several authorities agree. It is not properly qualified by adverbs like minimize 229 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 229"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"considerably, greatly, or somewhat. They can qualify a verb such as belittle, dimin- ish, reduce, or underrate, none of which is the meaning of minimize. Even when used properly, the word can be misunderstood. In isolation, this press sentence permits two interpreta- tions: In his session with the Tower com- mission, McFarlane said he had ac- quiesced in a White House effort to minimize the president’s role in the af- fair. Was the effort ( 1 ) to make sure that the president would play as small a role as possible or ( 2 ) to make the president’s past role appear as small as possible in the eyes of the public? The context shows that it was the second. A related adjective is minimal, the least possible (cost, tax, role, etc.). MISCHIEVOUS, MISCHIEVOUS- NESS. Discussing a case of sexual harassment on the job, the host of a na- tionally televised talk show said, “It really seems that it went from a kind of mischeviousness to a much more mali- cious acting out.” “Mischevious” or “mischeviousness,” with the emphasis on the second sylla- ble, is not a legitimate word. It is a dis- tortion of the proper word mischievous (adjective) or mischievousness (noun), pronounced MISS-chuh-vuss (ness). Mischievous means causing mischief; mischievousness, the inclination to cause mischief. Mischief is vexing action or conduct, or its result. Depending on the context, it can vary from a child’s imp- ishness to destruction or violence by a miscreant or nonhuman agent. A related word is mischievously (adverb), in a mis- chievous way. MISDEMEANOR. See CRIME, MISDEMEANOR, and FELONY. MISINFORMATION. See FACT. MISLEAD and MISLED. See LEAD (verb) and LED. MISNOMER. A guest on a TV inter- view show said that Henry Kissinger was born in the United States, not in Ger- many as many people thought. “It’s a common misnomer,” he said. An incorrect idea may be a misbelief, a misconception, or a mistake, but it is not a “misnomer.” A misnomer is a name or epithet that is wrongly or inap- propriately given to a person or thing; or an error in a name, particularly in a legal document. For instance, the term Indian when applied to an aborigine of the New World could be called a misnomer. Columbus was said to have used it for natives of the Bahamas in the erroneous belief that he was in India. (As for Mr. Kissinger’s country of birth: five reference books say Germany.) Misquotation.

One might think that the topic was fe- male abuse rather than drug abuse. The 230 mischievous, mischievousness 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 230"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"sentence, from a book about cannabis, literally says that the women were “widely used by the men.” It is an example of a dangler, a phrase that does not fit the rest of a sentence and does not accomplish what the writer thinks it does. It may apply to the wrong person or thing or to nothing. As a rule, modifiers adjoin the words they modify. ( See Modifying. ) In the ex- ample above, the writer wanted a phrase at the beginning of the sentence to mod- ify the word at the end, “cannabis.” The placement of the phrase and its lack of subject and verb encourage its bonding with the nearby subject of the sentence, “Bashilange women.” Here is a possible correction: “Bashilange women were rarely allowed to smoke cannabis, al- though it was widely used by the men.” In each of the four examples coming next, the noun that is supposed to be modified is not even there; it exists only in the mind of the writer or speaker. The dangling phrase affixes itself to the sub- ject that is there. A news report on national television about a car accident included this sen- tence: Severely burned and nearly an invalid, her lawyer expects that any agreement with General Motors will require se- crecy. If any who heard it sympathized with the lawyer, blame the opening phrase. Grammatically it applies to the subject, “her lawyer.” The description could have been placed in another sentence: “ The girl is severely burned and nearly an invalid. Her lawyer expects ....” This was on the radio: After being hit by the spray, the offi- cers called the fire department and an ambulance. Anyone who had just tuned in could rea- sonably gather that officers had been hit by spray. Just before that, the newscaster had announced that it was a seemingly drunk man who had been pepper- sprayed. Change the opening phrase to “After hitting the man with the spray” or “After the man was sprayed .” A newspaper example follows. The writer had escaped an earthquake. Now, finally, overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge, tears started to fall, tears of gratitude. This seems to say that the falling tears overlooked the bridge, a senseless state- ment unless “tears,” the subject, is a metaphor for rain. Change “overlook- ing” to as we overlooked, or else change “tears started to fall” to we started to shed tears. A dangler can appear at the end of a sentence. The example is from an article about alcoholic policemen. Termination is recommended if found drunk on the job. The subject is “Termination,” which of course cannot be “found drunk” though the sentence literally suggests otherwise. After “if,” insert an officer is. The examples above illustrate what textbooks and teachers call the dangling participle and have derided for genera- tions. Whoever coined the term evi- dently visualized a participle dangling precariously from a sentence. H. W. Fowler called them unattached partici- ples. As he saw them, they were not even dangling. They have been called also confused, disconnected, misrelated, sus- pended, and wrongly attached partici- ples. ( See Participle for a definition.) B. Some other danglers The problem goes beyond participles. Danglers come in different varieties, such as adjectival, adverbial, and nounal phrases. Examples follow, first a caption modifiers 231 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 231"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"that appeared under a picture of a car- toon character. At 52 , the feisty little black duck’s star may finally be on the rise. The subject is the duck’s “star,” which, we are literally told, is 52 (young for an astronomic object). If that is the duck’s age (an advanced age for a fowl), one way out of the dangling would be to scrap “At 52 .” A sentence could be added after “rise”: Daffy Duck is 52. (That pile-up of adjectives is dubious too. Commas would help: “The feisty, little, black duck’s. . . .”) This was broadcast on a national ra- dio news program: Travelers checks may protect you against thieves while on vacation. It seems to imply that traveler’s checks, if not thieves, are on vacation. After “while,” insert you are . Up to now, the examples all have con- tained phrases applying to the wrong words. But sometimes a phrase just dan- gles there, applying to nothing in the rest of the sentence. This example is from a restaurant review: More culinary independence was shown with what the menu called “Pork, Chicken and Veal Spiedini” ($ 7 . 50 ) with Polenta. Basically a grilled brochette, there was no chicken anywhere in sight. The latter sentence makes no sense. The first part of it has nothing to do with the second part grammatically or logically. Splitting it into two sentences helps to correct it: “It was basically a grilled bro- chette. There was no chicken anywhere in sight.” C. Journalistic danglers There is a similar type of dangler, so common in newspapers that it might be called the journalistic dangler. It is a de- scriptive noun phrase that comes at the end of a sentence and bears no grammat- ical relationship to the rest of the sen- tence. Often it deals with a precedent or a record. It may follow a dash. Five illus- trations from the press follow. By the time the last valve is in place, the tunnel’s price tag is expected to to- tal $ 5 billion—the most expensive project financed by the city. The phrase following the dash does not connect with anything. One expects it to modify “$ 5 billion,” for it immediately follows it. Now “$ 5 billion” is an amount, a cost, or a sum, but it is not a “project.” Change the phrase to some- thing like this: “—the highest sum for any project ever financed by the city.” Sister Francis Russell has co- founded a home for needy men, women and children, resettled Cam- bodian refugees in Denver, Cubans in Cheyenne, and recently received the Social Worker of the Year award from the National Association of Social Workers—the first recipient to have been active in the anti-nuclear move- ment. The phrase following the dash ought to modify the “award,” but “the first recip- ient . . .” does not do it. Either make the phrase a separate sentence (“She is the first recipient of the award . . .”) or rephrase it (“—the first such award pre- sented to someone active i n . . .”). By the way, the sentence has other faults, in- cluding a bad series and confusing punc- tuation. (Omit the comma after “Denver” and substitute and. Change the commas after “children” and “Cheyenne” to semicolons. See Punctua- tion, 11; Series errors. ) For a while it appeared that the parties would simply be canceled, 232 modifiers 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 232"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"a multibillion-dollar disaster for Tokyo’s hotels and restaurants. What does “a multibillion-dollar disas- ter” modify? Nothing visible. Preceding it with a verb, say causing, rescues the sentence. A newspaper and a news agency cov- ered the same event, and the lead para- graphs of both stories contained journalistic danglers of similar wording: Residents of Sacramento, Calif., voted Tuesday to shut down their util- ity’s only nuclear power plant, the first time voters have decided to close a working reactor. Residents of the capital area have voted to shut down the trouble- plagued Rancho Seco nuclear power plant, the first time such a facility has been closed by voters. What does “the first time” modify? Not the nearest noun, “plant”; not “Resi- dents”; not anything obvious. Again, the dangling phrase may be placed in a sepa- rate sentence, for instance: “This is the first time. . . .” Or else: “For the first time, voters have decided to close a working nuclear reactor. Residents of the Sacramento area voted Tuesday to shut down. . . .” (It was the first time where?— in the world, in the U.S.A.? Neither story explained.) D. Absolute constructions Some expressions resemble danglers, yet they have won the right to exist alongside their grammatical cousins. They are absolute constructions. A word or phrase in that category is not gram- matically connected with the sentence it appears in. Referring to no specific thing or person, it modifies a thought in a gen- eral way. Here are some examples: “ Strictly speaking, the stomach is an organ of di- gestion.” The opening phrase is very common, and nobody will think that the stomach is speaking. “Let’s play one more game, winner take all. ” There the unconnected phrase comes at the end. “ The storm having ended, we set sail on the third of May.” / “ My secretary being ill, I hired a temporary employee.” That form is well established, though consid- ered artificial by some. One difficulty is that someone may be tempted to insert a comma, incorrectly, after the first noun ( storm or secretary ). Absolute constructions include ad- verbs, such as admittedly, conceivably, happily, and thankfully; participles, as- suming, barring, concerning, consider- ing, failing, following, given, granted, judging, provided, and regarding; par- ticipial phrases, all things considered, de- pending on, generally speaking, and speaking of; and other phrases, after all, by and large, on the whole, in the long run, in the final analysis, to be frank, and to be honest. This is acceptable: “ Considering the era, it was a remarkable accomplish- ment” Considering is not connected with the subject. But this is a dangling participle: “ Considering his merits, my cat deserves to win the contest.” The cat seems to be engaged in an intellectual pursuit. E. Danglers that dangle Let us end our discussion of danglers with a couple of sentences from news stories (about the Amazon Basin and Kennedy Airport) in which things are said to really dangle. As the boats swerved among palms, rosewood and wild fruit trees, the rescue team kept ducking to avoid vines and aerial roots, dangling like dangerous nooses overhead. A cigarette dangling from his mouth, he said he wanted to sit down with the Port Authority management to modifiers 233 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 233"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"discuss his “plan” to legalize Smarte Carte hustling. To keep the rescue team from “dan- gling,” make it which dangled. And to avoid equating the man at the airport with a dangling cigarette, precede the latter sentence with With. See also Gerund, 2 (more dangling participles). 2. Extraneous The newspaper article quoted below is referring not to four governors (the diminutive governor, the conservative governor, etc.), but to only one. Mr. Mecham’s decision . . . pro- voked a constitutional confrontation between the Legislature and the first- term Republican Governor .... After his statement, the 63 -year-old Governor agreed to answer questions posed by the committee. . . . The diminutive Governor arrived at the hearing dressed in a powder blue suit. . . . The recall campaign and a boycott of the state by many convention groups began almost as soon as the conservative Governor took office. This illustrates a peculiar journalistic practice. Instead of devoting a sentence or paragraph to a description of a per- son, the writer sticks in descriptions at irrelevant places. Sometimes an extraneous modifying phrase interrupts a sentence: “Marceca, a civilian Army employee, refused to tes- tify at a Senate hearing Friday.” At times it starts a sentence: “ Born in . . . Aus- tralia . . . , Mr. Mitchell served as a Royal Canadian Air Force pilot. . . .” / “ A West Point graduate from Bridgeport, Conn., Mr. Mucci ran unsuccessfully for Congress. . . .” Neither of the forms rep- resented by the quotations is necessarily wrong. Either is acceptable when the facts are related: “Murphy, an amateur astronomer, discovered a comet last year.” / “ A corporate executive, he is well to do.” See also HAVE, HAS, HAD, 1; WHO, 2. 3. Misplaced A. Ludicrous placement This sentence appeared in a restaurant “guide” in a neighborhood newspaper: Enjoy Scallops Provencal or fresh salmon cooked to order while watch- ing football. If the fish’s last request is to see the Super Bowl on TV, the phrase “while watching football” is in the right place. More likely, it belongs at the beginning of the sentence. A modifier tends to bond with a nearby word or phrase. When the modi- fier is placed too far from what it is sup- posed to modify, the result can be ludicrous, like the example above or the four examples that follow. The moderator of a television forum ended the program by saying, “Thank you all for watching very much.” Was he thanking people for watching very much television? More likely the phrase “very much” was misplaced, belonging imme- diately after “all.” Interviewed on television, a lawyer told families of homicide victims: You have the right to recover, the same as if someone ran over your little girl in the street who was drunk. He was not implying that they would give their small daughters booze. Again, the final phrase was misplaced. Here is where it should have been: “. . . the same as if someone who was drunk ran over ....” A heading in a postal brochure reads: 234 modifiers 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 234"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"Let everyone know you’re moving ahead of time. Literally it says to announce a premature move. To make it say what was in- tended, put “ahead of time” ahead of “you’re moving.” This message seems to be a fixture on so-called noncommercial television: With twelve billion dollars in annual sales, your broker knows McKesson. No doubt he would love to do that much business. The phrase preceding the comma belongs after “McKesson.” Excerpts from a newspaper and a magazine are reminiscent of Groucho Marx’s tale of the time “I shot an ele- phant in my pajamas.” Police said he was convicted . . . of a misdemeanor . . . after he was stopped by police in a stolen truck. Face and hands greasepainted gold, . . . he collects a hefty amount of money from European tourists in a gold can. Groucho wondered what the elephant was doing “in my pajamas.” We can wonder what the police were doing “in a stolen truck” and what the European tourists were doing “in a gold can.” B. Ambiguous or misleading placement As absurdly as the above examples are worded, their meanings are nonetheless understandable. The six press quota- tions below illustrate that separating a modifier from what it is supposed to modify can obscure or transform the message. We start with three headlines; in each the modifying phrase was wrongly placed last. Readers of the headline “North learned he was fired from TV” could reasonably deduce that North had worked in TV. But the story under the headline said he had learned from TV that the President had announced his dismissal as a staff member of the Na- tional Security Council. The phrase from TV needed to modify learned, not “fired.” “Torture Is Depicted in Turkey” im- plies that someone in Turkey has de- scribed the matter in pictures or words. Actually the description took place in England, where a group (Amnesty Inter- national) had issued a report that ac- cused Turkish authorities of harming political prisoners. “Torture in Turkey Is Depicted” would have been right. The phrase in Turkey needed to modify To r - ture, not “Depicted.” “Children gather to celebrate life at Mount Zion Hospital” boosts the hospi- tal. But the story said that former pa- tients in the intensive care nursery had attended a party “to celebrate the gift of life,” not life at the hospital. The head- line’s last four words need relocation, as in this version: “Children gather at Mount Zion Hospital to celebrate life.” The rest of the city relies on Staten Is- land mainly as a garbage dump; more than three-quarters of the city’s garbage is disposed of in a vast landfill on the island known as Fresh Kills. A reader might wonder: is “the island known as Fresh Kills” off the coast of Staten Island, or did the writer put the phrase “known as Fresh Kills” in the wrong place? A possible editing: “. . . a vast landfill, known as Fresh Kills, on the island.” This excerpt deals with a concert in Prague: Mr. Neumann, who conducted with a large Civic Forum button in his lapel, was joined on the stage after the last movement, the “Hymn to Joy,” by Vaclav Havel, the playwright who modifiers 235 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 235"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"is the Forum’s leader and presidential candidate. Havel would not have appeared to get credit for a Beethoven composition if the sentence had begun, “After the last movement, the ‘Hymn to Joy,’ Mr. Neu- mann. . . .” This one deals with health records of nuclear weapons workers: Last month, the Department of En- ergy halted an agency letter from be- ing sent to the group that officially denied its request. Taken alone, the sentence seems to say that a certain “group that officially de- nied” a certain request of the depart- ment almost received some kind of letter. A study of the context suggests this rein- terpretation: The Department of Energy had pre- pared to send the group a letter that officially denied its request, but the department decided last month not to send it. This version, bringing the letter and its message together, would have averted the confusion (and left no one wonder- ing what an “agency letter” was and how it differed from any other letter). C. Unidiomatic placement Adverbs can get misplaced in unneces- sary efforts to avoid split infinitives or the division of verb phrases. See Adjec- tives and adverbs, 2; Infinitive, 4; Verbs, 4. D. Intrusion between THE and noun The, the definite article, pertains to what is already known. A common de- fect in the press is to intrude an adjective with new information between the and its noun. See THE, 2C. 4. Piled up The practice of piling up modifiers on top of a noun is a journalistic practice that results from an effort to be terse. In a typical example, a press item identified a man as “South Oklahoma City Cham- ber of Commerce executive vice presi- dent Jim Crosby.” The standard construction would be “Jim Crosby, ex- ecutive vice president of the South Okla- homa City Chamber of Commerce.” The writer’s purpose seemed to be to save the space of of, the, and a comma. It can get more confusing, as in this item from a magazine: What was O. J. Simpson white knight Johnnie Cochran doing popping into the fraud trial of Robert Maxwell’s sons in London recently? [Emphasis added to modifiers.] At first the item seems to be about Simp- son. While the style saves a minute amount of space, it may waste a bit of the reader’s time by obliging him to reread a passage to understand it. Seven words, a figure, and an initial- ism intervene between “purchase” and “buses” in this sentence from a newslet- ter: In January 1996 , the Golden Gate Bus Transit Division got the go ahead to purchase 30 newly designed Motor Coach Industries (MCI) “Commuter Special” buses. [Emphasis added.] A neater and clearer sentence would get to “buses” sooner, deferring part of that description (and putting a hyphen in go- ahead ). To avoid a mere two-letter word, someone writes, “Police arrested him on receiving stolen goods charges,” instead of “charges of receiving stolen goods.” Then there are the strings of hyphenated nouns used as adjectives, such as “the workers’ 50-cents-an-hour wage- 236 modifiers 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 236"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"increase demand,” instead of “The workers’ demand for a wage increase of 50 cents an hour.” See also Nouns, 5; Prepositions, 6; Ti- tles, 1; UNLIKE, 1. 5. Restrictive This is the last paragraph of a crime story distributed by a national news ser- vice: After Mr. L—— was arrested, he confessed to the Monday burglary. On reading the sentence above, one might wonder if there was a Sunday bur- glary, a Saturday burglary, and so on. Slipping in the word “Monday” tends to restrict the meaning. It implies that bur- glaries were committed on more than one day but that the arrested man con- fessed only to the one on Monday. That is not the case; only one burglary was under investigation. The essential fact is that the man confessed it. Four paragraphs above, the story mentions that the man was arrested on a Tuesday. That might have been a good place to make known that the arrest came a day after the crime. Instead, the writer waited until the end to stick the fact about Monday in a place where it did not belong. Here is a similar example, by a news- paper writer: The patient was reported in stable condition after the 7 : 30 a.m. opera- tion. The qualifier “ 7 : 30 a.m.” could make a reader wonder if there was, say, a noon operation or a 6 : 45 p.m. operation too. Three paragraphs earlier, the story says that the operation lasted more than six hours. That would have been an ideal place for the time. Two variables becloud the sentence below, broadcast on network television. Of the several special-education stu- dents aboard the bus, only one suf- fered minor injuries from flying glass. A person who had tuned in late and heard that sentence alone might reason- ably wonder: Did the others suffer major injuries from flying glass? Minor injuries from other causes? Major injuries from other causes? The problem lay in the modifiers of the noun “injuries” that the telecaster had jammed into the sentence. Those modifiers, “minor” (adjective) and “from flying glass” (prepositional phrase), tended to restrict the meaning. One who had heard the whole piece, of which the above excerpt is the final sen- tence, might guess that this message was intended: . . . Only one suffered any injuries. They were minor wounds, caused by flying glass. Here each fact is isolated, not confused by any other fact. 6. Senseless Announcements like this make one want to talk to the television set: We will be back two weeks from tonight. Until then, this is Dan Rather. Who will you be then, Dan? “Until then” made no sense and could easily have been left out. Phrases of that sort often conclude broadcasts, their purpose evidently being to connect sentences and provide smooth transitions. They have little or no meaning. Radio disc jockeys typically utter lines like this: “You’re listening to KAZOO, Zanyville, where the time is 7 : 39 a.m.” What time is it elsewhere in town? Modifying. To modify in grammar is to qualify or limit or alter the sense of (a modifying 237 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 237"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"word or group of words). In “the red mill,” for instance, the adjective red modifies the noun mill. In “They run fast,” the adverb fast modifies the verb run. A modifier is a word or word group that modifies another word or word group. It may be an adjective, an adverb, a participle, a phrase, etc. See Modifiers for a catalogue of misused varieties, such as danglers. MOISTURIZE. See -IZE ending, 1. MOM, MAMA, MA. Mom origi- nates in baby talk. It is short for mama, also spelled mamma and momma, which is a doubling of ma. Ma is an infantile utterance that is common internation- ally. Such terms are expected in children’s vocabulary and among the appellations by which adults address their mothers. They appear increasingly in other collo- quial speech. Except in quotations, none of them has any place in more formal speech or writing, particularly in an oth- erwise solemn piece like an obituary: K——’s mom said he loved to surf so much that he will have a surfer’s fu- neral with an ocean ceremony off Stinson at sunset on Friday ....

MONKEY. See APE and MONKEY. Mood. The word mood as used in grammar is a set of verb forms. It does not have anything to do with the happy or sad type of mood. The grammatical mood is just a variation of mode. It shows the mode, or manner, in which a speaker or writer wants to represent an action, whether factually, command- ingly, or otherwise. Grammarians call the moods indica- tive, imperative, and subjunctive. By far, the most frequently used one is the indicative mood. It is the ordinary verb form. It suggests that one is present- ing a fact or asking a question about fact. Every sentence in this entry up to now is in that mood. In the imperative mood, one gives a command or tells someone to do some- thing. Examples of sentences in that mood are “Come here” / “Stop, look, and listen” / “Friends, Romans, country- men, lend me your ears.” The subjunctive mood is for various statements or questions in which the ac- tions are doubtful, hypothetical, condi- tional, or otherwise not factual. It is the mood that is used least often. See Sub- junctive. MORAL and MORALE. See Con- fusing pairs. MORE and MOST. It is a rather common error to use “most” in place of more. A news article produced the ex- ample. Foreign analysts here are undecided over which version [of events in China], the official or the foreign, is most believed. “Most” should be changed to more, be- cause only two versions are mentioned. The rule is that when just two things are compared, more (comparative) is the word to use; and when three or more things are compared, most (superlative) is the word.

See OVER and MORE THAN. MORE THAN ONE. Although a logical case could perhaps be made for its plurality, the phrase more than one is usually treated as singular. “More than one union claims jurisdiction.” / “There is more than one way to skin a catfish.” ( One draws the next word, the subject noun [ union or way ], into its singular sphere of influence; and the predicate verb [ claims or is ] agrees with the noun.) It is different when the phrase more than one is split up. “More unions than one claim jurisdiction.” / “There are more ways than one to skin a catfish.” (The plural implication of more makes the subject noun that follows it [ unions or ways ] plural; the predicate verb [ claim or are ] agrees with the noun.) In the journalistic sample below, the trouble transcends the question of singu- lar versus plural. More than one out of five Hispanics in HISD [Houston Independent School District] drops out of school. If the statement had said that “one out of five Hispanics in HISD drops out . . . ,” it would not be arguable. But the “ more than one” phrasing is an absurdity. More than one person is at least two persons; you cannot have, say, a person and a half. Presumably the writer meant not two (or she would have said so) but something like “ 22 percent of Hispanics” or “more than one-fifth of Hispanics.” MORE with comparative. More does not go with the comparative form of any descriptive word. The radio speakers who slipped up as follows probably knew that elementary rule. Sometimes it [purple asparagus] can be a little more sweeter than the green asparagus. There is a way to empower your chil- dren and make them far more better and powerful students. ...You have canker sores and that’s going to let the organism get in a little more easier. In the first quotation, omit “more.” In the second, relocate it (“far better and more powerful”). In the third, keep it but change “easier” to easily (“a little more easily ”). More and the -er ending, which means more, are redundant together. One speaking standard English does not normally say “more sweeter” / “more better” / “more easier,” and so on. (Speakers of Hawaiian pidgin do say such things.) “More preferable” is another redun- dancy. “More” is usually superfluous, because preferable is a comparative form.

An article about selecting meat appeared with this mistake (or shall we say “mis-steak”?): “The filet mignon, he said, is the most tenderest but also has the least flavor.” You may say that something is the most tender or the tenderest but not that it is the “most tenderest.” Most (as an adverb) does not go with any word con- taining the suffix -est, which means the same as most. Someone can be the most clever or the cleverest, the most happy or the happiest, the most silly or the silliest, and so on. Certain superlatives take only the most form. Most regularly precedes ad- jectives and adverbs of three or more syl- lables (such as astounding and terribly ) and sometimes those of fewer syllables (such as dreadful and aptly ). most with superlative 239 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 239"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"Some other adjectives and adverbs take only the -est form (for example, few and fast, which become fewest and fastest ).

MUCH. 1. “A BIT MUCH.” 2. “MUCHLY.” 1. “A BIT MUCH” The contemporary cliché represented by these press excerpts seems a bit con- tradictory: “His IRA penalties seem a bit much” / “Houseman says the success of his S-B ad has become a bit much” / “The Government began to fear that the reaction was a bit much.” When “bit” and “much” are juxta- posed, the idea of smallness or modera- tion clashes with the idea of largeness or notableness. Such a clash occurred also when “a little” became the modifier, in a televi- sion forum: “To be shocked that this is going on [charging people money to dine with the president] is a little much.” Too much means an excessive amount, degree, or extent. That amount etc. may be only slightly excessive: a lit- tle too much or a bit too much. To omit the too is to create a contradiction. In the first example, a headline, there is also a conflict between the plural “penalties” and the singular “much.” See MANY and MUCH. 2. “MUCHLY” Occasionally someone attaches a su- perfluous -ly to much, either mistakenly or facetiously (“Thank you muchly”). H. W. Fowler dismissed “muchly” as worn-out humor in 1926 , and it has not grown funnier since then. Centuries back it was used seriously and deemed proper. Much is now the standard adverb. “We don’t depend much on the government” is synonymous with “We don’t depend greatly on the government.” Much can be an adjective (“It gives me much pleasure”). It can also be a noun, meaning a large amount or quan- tity (“Did you find much”?) or a great thing (“The job is not much”). MUNCH. Dictionaries do not agree on how munch originated. Some say it was an imitation of chewing. Others say it came from the French manger, to eat, plus the English crunch by way of the Middle English munchen. To most of them, munch suggests the sound of chewing. The chewing is at least ample and vigorous and perhaps steady. Is munching really going on in the press ex- amples below? Wednesday evening at the Opera House, Dance Theater of Harlem in- vited the community to munch on a bit of birthday cake. [Only “a bit of” cake for the whole community?] The streets of the city still are filled with people of money munching bran muffins as they push their way through the crowd. [A strange por- trait of San Francisco.] Too late for a prime table, they seemed to be happy in a tiny corner spot[,] munching on steak sandwiches and beer. You munch raw carrots and crisp toast, not a typical, fluffy birthday cake. A bran muffin is not likely to be munched either. Sandwiches on toast may require munching, but how on earth does any- one munch beer? MURDER. See Crimes, 4.

NANO- prefix. Nano- is a combin- ing form meaning billionth (in the American sense: one part in 1 , 000 , 000 , 000 ). It is used in scientific contexts. A nanocurie is one billionth of a curie. A nanogram is one billionth of a gram. A nanometer is one billionth of a meter. A nanosecond is one billionth of a second. Although it is a theoretical unit and brief beyond perception, it has been seized by nonscientists for displays of verbal extravagance. A journalist said, in a TV forum, that a political adviser had worked for a can- didate, not for a day or a week, but “for a nanosecond.” The host of a radio talk show said, “Anyone who can think for more than a nanosecond knows how specious that whole line of argumenta- tion [for natural birth control] is.” A headline in a full-page, full-color maga- zine ad for an employment service read, “Opportunity Knocks Every Other Nanosecond In Silicon Valley.” Perhaps the company felt that “Every Nanosec- ond” would be overdoing it. Still, a hint of 500 million jobs every second depre- ciated the ad’s credibility. Nano- was drawn from the Latin nanus, which came from the Greek nanos. The words mean dwarf. See also BILLION.

The title “Feeling Nauseous” flashed on the television screen several times to an- nounce a forthcoming report on motion sickness. Nauseated was needed. “Nau- seous,” although common in conversa- tion, is improper for more formal use. Nauseated (adjective) means suffering from nausea (noun), a feeling of sickness in the stomach. “I feel nauseated.” That which is nauseous (adjective) produces nausea. “It’s a nauseous gas.” A synonym is nauseating. A person can be nauseated without being nauseous in the same way that a person can be endangered, periled, or poisoned without being dangerous, per- ilous, or poisonous. To nauseate (verb, transitive) some- one is to produce nausea in the person. “The gas nauseates me.” / “The rough sea has nauseated us.” Less common rel- atives are nauseation and nauseousness (nouns) and nauseatingly and nau- seously (adverbs).

A seedless orange that bears a depres- sion resembling a navel is called a navel orange. The navel (noun) is the mark on the abdomen representing the place where the umbilical cord was connected to the fetus. Naval (adjective), as in naval officer, pertains to a navy.

The incident may be described as a near-accident, a near- disaster, or a near-tragedy, but it was an actual miss. When near is tied to the noun with a hyphen, it implies that the accident, dis- aster, tragedy, or other incident almost occurred. It came close to occurring but was barely avoided. The miss was not avoided. What should have been avoided was the hyphen—or, better yet, the whole phrase. What about these two headlines, with no hyphen?—“Near Miss for Elizabeth Dole” and “Near Miss Reported in Smoke.” Near can also mean narrow. As an example, at least four dictionaries give “near escape.” So we cannot con- demn whoever wrote those two head- lines. But why use an expression that can be confusing? Some readers may not know whether a “near escape from prison” was an escape or not. As for lis- teners: oral reports have no punctuation. There are better ways to express the idea of a narrowly averted air accident, or other mishap, as in the following ex- amples. An article was headed, “Planes Just Miss Collision Over Sea.” One sen- tence of the text said, “Both crews planned to file official near-collision re- ports with the F.A.A.” The Dole story said that a plane carrying her “was in- volved in a near-collision with another aircraft.” NEAT. Nothing is wrong with a neat home, desk, or person—one that is spick-and-span, orderly, uncluttered. A neat trick or job is performed with adroitness, deftness, precision. And if you drink whiskey neat, undiluted, you can get drunk quickly. On the other hand, “neat” in the juve- nile sense is slang: like “cool,” an all- purpose adjective of approval, synonymous with “keen,” “groovy,” and “swell” from earlier eras. Adults have been perpetuating the childish use of “neat.” In response to a news report of a robot designed to save lives by destroy- ing land mines, a young woman at a TV anchor desk made this penetrating com- ment: “That’s pretty neat.” On the same day, also on TV, a noted critic expressed his discerning appraisal of the Theremin, the electronic musical instrument: “It sounds neat.” A book instructs computer users that a certain program “has a neat way to change text” and that “you can do all kinds of neat things with headers ....” See also COOL. NEE. Nee or née, pronounced NAY, means born, as it does in French.

This quotation is aberrant: In a news conference, the Pravda editor, Ivan T. Frolov, also vowed that under his direction Pravda would nei- ther cater to conservatives nor radi- cals. . . . The sentence is not logical. It says that Pravda would neither “cater” (verb) nor “radicals” (noun). “Neither” and “nor” are followed by different parts of speech. The simplest way to fix the sentence is to exchange the positions of “neither” and “cater to,” thereby equating noun and noun: “. . . Pravda would cater to neither conservatives [noun] nor radicals [noun]. . . .” Another way is to exchange “neither” and “cater” and add another to to the “nor” side, thereby equating prepositional phrases: “. . . Pravda would cater neither to conservatives nor to radicals. . . .” Neither does not go with “or.” How- ever, if nor introduces two closely related nouns, or may connect them: “Neither Bennett nor Johnson or his wife was in the house when the fire broke out.” See also NOR. 2. Negativity Neither without nor means not either (adjective) or not either one (pronoun). Respective examples: “She selected nei- ther suitor” and “She selected neither.” Inasmuch as neither carries a negative meaning, it is wrong in a sentence like this, which has another negative: “I didn’t go neither.” Use either to avoid a double negative. Two dialogues from a situation com- edy follow. Each response has two words, both wrong. [Elaine:] I haven’t been eating any- thing different. [Jerry:] Me either. [Mother:] I’ve never seen your arm move like that. [Father:] Me either. The negative does not carry over from the first speaker to the second. The latter needs his own negative, whether neither or another n -word. Among correct re- sponses that could have been put in the script are “I neither” / “Neither have I” / “Nor have I” / Jerry: “I haven’t either” / 244 needless to say 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 244"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"Father: “I’ve never seen it either.” (“Me either” might at best be defended as an ellipsis, or a short form, for a sentence that nobody would be likely to utter: “Me haven’t been eating anything differ- ent either” or “Me have never seen it ei- ther.” Maybe Tarzan could get away with “Me” instead of I for the subject of a sentence, but native speakers of English should know better. See Pronouns, 10. ) 3. Number and person Neither without nor is construed as singular. A verb that follows must be sin- gular: “Only two of the suits are left and neither fits me” (not “fit”). Any object of the verb also is singular if it would normally be singular for an individual subject. This is from a news article: Neither of the women, who were said to be babysitting the children, was wearing seat belts. . . . The verb, “was wearing,” is correctly singular; but the object is inconsistently plural: “seat belts.” Neither was wearing a seat belt. (The material between the commas is irrelevant to the main thought and belongs in another sen- tence.) Neither without nor pertains to only two things or two persons, not to three or more. “Neither of the two boys” / “neither of the couple” / “neither of the pair” are correct. “Her feelings were very hurt that neither of the three of us showed up” (said by a caller to a radio psychologist) is incorrect. See NONE, 1. The neither . . . nor construction sometimes applies to more than two things or two persons: “Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night stays these couriers. . . .” Note that nor is repeated for each item. This excerpt from a book is not idiomatic: . . . Neither the President, Congress as a whole, nor either of its houses may constitutionally defeat action by the rest of the government to meet the country’s responsibilities abroad. When nouns that immediately follow neither and nor are singular, the verb is singular: “Neither Jim nor Al earns much money” (not “earn”). When both nouns are plural, the verb is plural: “Neither gems nor precious metals were found in the wreckage.” When the nouns differ in number, should the verb be singular or plural? If the plural noun is nearer to the verb than the singular noun, the verb should be plural: “Neither his wife nor his sisters like his politics.” But if the singular noun is nearer, a problem arises. In the sen- tence, “Neither his sisters nor his wife ———his politics,” some authorities would allow likes, others like. The ad- vice here is to place the plural noun (“sisters”) second, as in the former ex- ample, or to recast the sentence, e.g.: “His wife and sisters dislike his politics.” Any possessive pronoun that follows nor also must agree in number with the verb: “Neither Charles nor Susan owns his or her own home” (not “their”). A final puzzle concerns the verb fol- lowing a personal pronoun. An author- ity lets the nearer subject govern the verb: “Neither he nor I am at fault.” / “Neither I nor he is at fault.” But revi- sion may be better: “He is not at fault, and neither am I.” See also EITHER. NEVER MIND. A weekly’s front page contained the headline “Never- mind the English” (referring to competi- tion from New Zealand in popular music). In a column in a daily, one read, “Nevermind that I had repeatedly been warned . . .” (not to lean too far back in a chair). Never mind is a phrase of two words: the adverb never, meaning at no time or not at all; and the verb mind, meaning to never mind 245 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 245"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"pay attention to or care about someone or something (transitive) or to take no- tice or be concerned (intransitive).

Those who were born in Japan should not be called “Nisei.” An immigrant to the United States from Japan is an Issei; the word is Japanese for first generation. Nisei, meaning second generation, refers to a U.S.-born child of those immigrants. A U.S.-born grandchild of the immi- grants is a Sansei, which means third generation. Each term may be used un- changed as a plural, or s may be added: Isseis, Niseis, and Sanseis.

Two scientists at the University of California School of Medicine were being honored for a dis- covery concerning cancer cells. “Today they won the Nobel Peace Prize for Medicine,” a newscaster announced on television. She was confused. The Dalai Lama of Tibet won the Nobel Peace Prize that year. His activities had nothing to do with medical discoveries, and the research of the scientists, Bishop and Varmus, had nothing to do with the pro- motion of peace. The peace prize is decided and awarded in Norway; the prize in medicine or physiology, in Sweden along with separate prizes for accomplish- ments in chemistry, economics, litera- ture, and physics. A bequest of Alfred B. Nobel, Swedish chemist and the inventor of dynamite, established the Nobel Prizes in five fields. They were first awarded in 1901 . The Bank of Sweden added the economics prize in 1969 . Win- ners get money and medals. NOBODY. See Pronouns, 2C. NO CHOICE. A restaurant may of- fer no choice of soups. A dictatorship may offer no choice in an election. But “I had no choice”—or “We have no choice” or a variation on that theme—is also a hoary excuse for gory acts. Hitler said, on launching World War II, “I have no other choice” than to fight Poland. In the United States, “We have no choice” was Theodore Roosevelt’s ra- tionale for the nation’s asserting its power abroad. At a time of supposed peace, a na- tional newspaper reported that U.S. planes had attacked Serbian planes. Its explanation was that the Serbs had 246 nevertheless 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 246"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"flown contrary to the United Nations’ wishes, leaving the Americans “little choice but to blow them out of the sky” (a non sequitur). “Little choice”?

See THAT and WHICH. NONE. 1. Number. 2. Other uses. 1. Number None (pronoun) may be construed as singular or plural or either, depending on its meaning in a sentence. A pedagogic and journalistic rule has long held it to be singular only. Indeed its original ver- sion, in Old English, nan, meant not one: it was a fusion of ne, not, and an, one. Yet most authorities accept both con- structions, and literature records both. In the Bible we find both “trouble is near and there is none to help” and “none come to the appointed feasts.” Dryden wrote that “none but the brave deserves the fair” and Tennyson, “I hear a voice, but none are there.” None may mean not one, emphasiz- ing singularity: “I asked each person, and none was aware of the problem.” Instead of none, however, using not one or not a single one may be a stronger way to make the point. Unquestionably none is singular when it means not any amount or part: “None of the merchan- dise is domestic.” / “She says none of the advice helps her.” None may be plural when it means not any (people or things): “Of all the people in our town, none appear more industrious than the Lees.” At times it must be plural: “None of these con- tenders have much fondness for one an- other.” Using “has” would conflict with “one another,” which is plural. “None of the troops were completely prepared for their mission abroad.” Nobody would be speaking of one “troop.” At times none may be regarded as ei- ther singular or plural. “Of the models advertised, none suits me” or “none suit me.” Singularity is possible in this sen- tence: “None of the houses is for sale.” But “houses are ” has fewer s ’s, a consid- eration if the sentence is to be spoken. Whichever construction is selected, any related verb and pronoun must agree in number. “None of the machines still works as well as it used to” or “ work as well as they used to” / “None of the men has his orders yet” or “ have their orders yet.” ( See also Pronouns, 2. ) Whether you deem none to be singu- lar or plural in a particular sentence, stick with your decision. The quotation is from a short story in a magazine. None of these players was over 18 , and they were trying too hard either for the $ 100 prize or to impress the girls gathering behind them. Were should replace “was,” which is inconsistent with “they were” and “them.” None meaning not any applies to three or more people or things, not to two.

The phrase none the less or word nonetheless means nevertheless or however. “Small in stature, he was none the less [or “nonetheless”] skilled in basketball.” • None the plus comparative. In a sentence like “They were none the wiser,” none means not at all or to no extent. • None too. In its understatement, this phrase serves as mild sarcasm.

How it is used Nor (conjunction) often serves as the negative version of or. It is most com- mon in the construction neither . . . nor: “This is neither fish nor fowl.” In such a construction, nor is always right. It is no more correct to say “neither . . . or” than to say “either . . . nor.” Nor, like or, links alternatives. When the alternatives make up the subject of a sentence and each alternative is singular, the verb too must be singular. Example: “Neither Dan nor Tom speaks French” (not “speak”). When the alternatives are plural, the verb is plural. When the alter- natives differ in number, complications arise. See NEITHER, 3. A sentence without neither may still take nor. Example: “The telephone has not rung, nor has any mail arrived.” Such a sentence contains two thoughts, or ideas, and the negative force of the not would not carry over to the second thought without help. Nor furnishes that help. (Some may find this construction difficult to master or too formal for their tastes. The second clause may be ex- pressed in other ways, e.g., “and no mail has arrived.”) “Will you condemn him . . . who shows no partiality to princes, nor re- gards the rich more than the poor . . . ?” In that Biblical example, the no unaided would have no effect on the idea about the rich and the poor. Nor negates the action of the verb regards. “Or” would not do it. See also NEITHER, 1, 2. 2. NOR and OR A rather common error is to use “nor” redundantly in place of or.

A better phras- ing is “didn’t have a rudder or a tailplane.” The sentence is simple, and the one negative (“didn’t have”) fits each item (each aeronautic part). An alternative phrasing is “didn’t have a rudder, nor did it have a tail- plane.” The sentence no longer is a sim- ple one (a clause has been added), and no longer does the one negative cover it all. Under those circumstances, nor is the conjunction to use. In another book we read: “His son’s literary success would never cheer Lord Auchinleck nor improve relations be- tween them.” Change “nor” to or. The sentence is simple, and the first negative (“never”) fits each item (“cheer” and “improve”). Some grammarians would condone the use of nor in each excerpt as a way of stressing a difference between the two items. It conforms with the practice of some past writers, including Shake- speare and Shaw. Except for those who fancy themselves in that class, the safest course is to follow the rules. See also OR. NORMALCY. A myth that “Presi- dent Harding coined ‘normalcy’ from ig- norance of ‘normality’ ” has been perpetuated since the twenties. Two au- thors of a handbook for writers repeated it (in the above quotation). So did a his- tory teacher of mine in high school. It dates at least from 1929 , when a writer alleged in a tract of the Society for Pure English: If . . . ‘normalcy’ is ever to become an accepted word it will presumably be because the late President Harding did not know any better. The Oxford English Dictionary traces normalcy to a mathematics dictionary published in 1857 —eight years before Harding was born. It is the persistent objection to nor- malcy, not the use of the word, that is based on ignorance. The word is a valid alternative to normality, but be advised of that objection. The statement below was uttered in 1920 by the man who occupied the White House from 1921 to 1923 . It is technically impeccable, perhaps too slick; it has the earmarks of a speech writer. America’s present need is not heroics but healing, not nostrums but nor- malcy, not revolution but restoration. NORTH POLE and MAGNETIC POLE. At a national meeting of math- ematics teachers, a salesman was selling compasses. “These compasses draw cir- cles; they won’t point to the North Pole,” a columnist wrote. The magnetic compass, the type of compass that he probably was alluding to, does not point to the North Pole. It points to the North Magnetic Pole (or Magnetic North Pole ). The location of the latter varies from time to time, but atlases published in the 1990 s place it amid the Queen Elizabeth Islands in the waters of northern Canada, some 800 miles from the true North Pole. (There is another type of navigational compass, the gyroscopic compass, used on large ships, which does point to the true North Pole, although no one would ex- pect it to be for sale at a teachers’ con- vention.) Just as the earth has two poles, north and south, it has two magnetic poles, north and south. Either end of a magnet also is called a magnetic pole. north pole and magnetic pole 249 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 249"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"NOT. 1. Ambiguity. 2. Problems of placement. 1. Ambiguity The use of this adverb requires care. Usually not is definite in its meaning: negation, refusal, in no way, to no de- gree, no. Yet in some contexts, as indi- cated below, not can permit widely varying interpretations. A. NOT ALL and ALL . . . NOT Not all . . . are is different from all . . . are not. The latter invites confu- sion. Normally the place for not is im- mediately before the word or phrase that it qualifies. These two sentences do not have the same meaning: • Not all lawyers are truthful. • All lawyers are not truthful. The first means that some are untruth- ful. The second means that all are un- truthful; that is the literal meaning, although it may not be the intended meaning. The problem is essentially the same when not is separated from every plus noun, everyone, or everything. “Not ev- ery applicant is qualified” (some are un- qualified) is far different from “Every applicant is not qualified” (literally, all are unqualified). A book says (about writing an arti- cle): “Everything that will go into it is not in your notebook.” The authors meant: “ Not everything that will go into it is in your notebook.” B. NOT TOO The standard meaning of not too is not excessively. It can be confused with a colloquial meaning: not sufficiently. “That chinaware is not too fancy for a holiday dinner,” says Gertrude. Does she approve or disapprove of the dishes? The standard meaning is that they are not excessively fancy. The colloquial meaning is that they are not sufficiently fancy. Fred, a farmer, says, “We haven’t had too much rain this year.” (Of course -n’t is a contraction of not. ) He could be ei- ther pleased or displeased by the weather. If rain was excessive last year and flooded his farm but has been nor- mal this year, Fred may be speaking liter- ally and expressing his relief. On the other hand, if there is a drought, “haven’t had too much” may be his way of saying “haven’t had enough. ” See also TOO. C. NOT with AS It can be confusing to follow not with as, in the manner of this example: “Columbus was not the first European to discover America, as many people be- lieve.” Do “many people” believe that he was or that he was not ? Rephrase it. Depending on meaning, you might either begin with the phrase “Contrary to pop- ular belief, . . .” or end the sentence with “America” and add a sentence: “Many people now believe that other Europeans arrived earlier.” See also AS, 4. D. NOT with BECAUSE etc. Whether not applies just to the next word or to more can be a puzzle. The sentence is apt to include because. “He was not hired because of his background.” Was he hired for another reason? Or was he turned down, and, if so, was the reason something in his background? In either case, rephrasing is desirable. For example: “He was hired, not because of his background, but be- cause . . .” or “He was not hired, and the reason was his background.” If a sentence has two ideas, they should be clearly distinguished. An explanatory phrase without be- cause can create a similar ambiguity. 250 not 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 250"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"“The bill was not introduced for politi- cal reasons.” / “We did not file at Grant’s request.” Does “not” modify all that fol- lows or just the verb (“introduced” or “file”)?

See also LIKE, 1; UNLIKE, 1. F. Omission of NOT The fear of omitting not leads the press to misrepresent legal proceedings. It usually reports pleas and verdicts of not guilty as “innocent.” Not is infre- quently forgotten; Reversal of meaning, 1, gives examples. See also Guilt and innocence, 2. G. Superfluous NOT In a complicated sentence, not is sometimes introduced unnecessarily, producing a double negative. “. . . He had found nothing to make him doubt that H—— was not rightly convicted.” In other words, he firmly be- lieved that the person was wrongly con- victed. That is the opposite of the intended meaning: Actually he believed that the conviction was justified. But a not was erroneously slipped into the sen- tence, canceling the negative effect of doubt and reversing the meaning. Omit not, or rephrase the sentence; for in- stance: “. . . He had found no reason to question H———’s conviction.” See also Double negative. H. Uncompleted NOT Sometimes it is unclear what not per- tains to. Whatever that is has been omit- ted. “The Senate’s current version calls for spending $ 2 . 6 billion for drug enforce- ment that the House does not.” The House “does not” what? The writer has left out a necessary verb. See also Ellipsis. 2. Problems of placement Referring to the two sides in a labor dispute, a television reporter said, “They have been not making any progress.” The statement is clear, but “have not been making” would be more idiomatic. Perhaps he was under the erroneous im- pression that splitting a verb pair, like have been, was wrong. Putting not in the wrong place can throw a sentence out of kilter; witness this complex example from a newspa- per’s front page: It was an attempt not to change President Bush’s mind, which the or- ganizers of the march consider im- probable if not impossible, or to persuade Congress to pass a law, which they deem unnecessary. Better: “It was not an attempt to change. . . .” Thus not modifies “was an attempt.” The news writer misplaced “not,” modifying “to change”; a reader could at first think the organizers at- tempted to avoid changing the presi- dent’s mind. The “which” clauses (with unclear antecedents and four negatives, including a second “not”) contribute to the muddiness. When a sentence has multiple verbs, it may not be clear which one not modifies. It takes some effort to interpret this press example correctly: Defense attorney Nancy G—— asked the court to dismiss that charge because the ruling involved a third party who struck a pregnant woman, not the mother herself [emphasis added]. Does the emphasized phrase contrast with “involved a third party” or with not 251 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 251"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"“struck a pregnant woman”? A reader at first could reasonably think it refers to the latter, because “woman” immedi- ately precedes “not.” However, the story suggests that the other interpretation is correct. It would be less ambiguous to say that “the ruling involved, not a preg- nant woman, but a third party who struck a pregnant woman.” (The writer encouraged confusion by following “pregnant woman” with “the mother,” instead of repeating “pregnant woman.” One could take them to be two people, for a pregnant woman is not necessarily a mother. See Synonymic silliness. ) A fad based on a disconnected “not” appears to be fading away, fortunately. Someone first makes an outlandish state- ment; for example, “The President has ditched his wife and moved in his girl friend.” After a pause, the single word “not” follows, supposedly canceling the fib. If a listener does not stick around for the “not” or fails to recognize it when so grossly misplaced, a rumor can take wing. Not goes before the to of an infinitive: “She swore not to reveal their secret,” instead of “to not.” See Infinitive, 4. Among entries dealing with not are BECAUSE, 1; BUT, 6; Contractions, 2; Double negative; NOT ABOUT TO; NOT ONLY; NOT TO MENTION; PROOFREAD, PROOFREADING (ex- ample); Reversal of meaning, 1; THAT, ALL THAT; WHICH, 1 (example). NOT ABOUT TO. The subtitle of a magazine article about hotel maids was a long one: If they were going to clean rooms, they were going to be well paid—so they struggled for their union. And they’re not about to give it up. The phrase “not about to” in the sense of determined not to or unwilling to (do something) is colloquial and regional. It was curious to find it displayed promi- nently in a reputedly sophisticated publi- cation representing a city where that expression was alien. The standard meaning of about to is ready to or soon to (do something). In the negative, the encroachment of the nonstandard meaning brings problems of ambiguity. “He is about to leave for home” is fairly clear. “He is not about to leave for home,” as broadcast nationally, is ambiguous. Does it mean that he will not leave soon (the standard meaning) or that he is determined not to leave at all (the nonstandard meaning)? Even when the meaning is clearer, the nonstandard phrase is not appropriate in writing, unless the writer’s intent is to re- produce colloquial, regional speech; and it can be risky. In the press sample below, a foreign correspondent used the phrase in the nonstandard way (the context in- dicates), using it inappropriately and— as it turned out—inaccurately: But the reaction by the authorities indicated that the Czechoslovak [Communist] leadership is not about to take the path chosen in East Ger- many. The leadership in Czechoslovakia was indeed “about to take the path chosen in East Germany.” Four weeks after the ar- ticle appeared, it resigned. NOT ALL THAT. See THAT, ALL THAT. “NOT HARDLY.” See Double nega- tive, 3. NOTHER. As a legitimate variation of other, nother is obsolete. It is now di- alectal and nonstandard.

The n is needed only when the indefinite article adjoins the o. See A and AN. NOT JUST, NOT MERELY, NOT SIMPLY. See NOT ONLY. NOT ONLY. In using the phrase not only, watch out for three pitfalls. This sentence (from a book on marketing) il- lustrates them: The franchise not only buys train- ing, but a recognized brand name. 1 . Misplacement of not only. The word only tends to attach itself to whatever immediately follows. In the sample, the word following “only” is “buys.” The writer did not intend to empha- size “buys,” but that is what he has done. He meant to emphasize “train- ing.” ( See also ONLY. ) 2 . Grammatical imbalance. Not only and but also are sister (correlative) conjunctions. The grammatical struc- tures following them must match. In the sample, the phrase following “not only” is a verb and its object (“buys training”) whereas what follows “but” is a noun phrase (“a recognized brand name”). The phrases do not match grammatically. 3 . Omission of also (or a synonym). A sentence like the following does not need also (or a synonym): “Today I choose not steak but lobster.” An item is substituted for another. However, the next sentence needs the also: “To- day I choose not only steak but also lobster” (or “ but lobster too ” or as well or in addition ). An item is added to another. We correct the quotation by inter- changing “not only” and “buys” and by inserting also: The franchise buys not only train- ing but also a recognized brand name. Now noun matches noun, and also (ad- verb) announces an addition. (The comma is not necessary.) “The franchise not only buys training but” would be acceptable if followed by another verb and its object, e.g., “ buys a recognized brand name also.” The next (newspaper) example prop- erly contains “also,” but it too misplaces “not only,” producing a grammatical imbalance. The fact that the army fired on Chi- nese citizens not only shocked the Chinese people but also large seg- ments of the army .... Again “not only” is followed by a verb and its object (“shocked the Chinese people”) whereas “but” is followed by a noun phrase (“large segments of the army”). The sentence may be corrected most simply by interchanging “not only” and “shocked”: . . . shocked not only the Chinese people but also large segments of the army. This way, noun matches noun. Occasionally not only does not need to be followed by but or by also (or syn- onym): • But is unnecessary if the contrast that it expresses is indicated in another way; for instance: “Protecting the environment is not only good public policy: It can be good business too.” • Also (or synonym) is unnecessary when what follows the but does not add something substantial but merely intensifies what came before; for instance: “He was not only a poet but a great poet.” not only 253 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 253"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"The principles that apply to not only apply also to similar phrases, like not just, not merely, and not simply. “What helps agriculture benefits not just farm- ers but the nation as well.” NOTORIETY, NOTORIOUS. A person who is notorious (adjective) is well known for something bad or objec- tionable. “The accused is notorious for his drug dealing.” / “He’s a notorious liar.” The condition of being notorious is notoriety (noun). A Wall Street analyst was introduced on television as “one man who has achieved some notoriety for his predic- tions.” Fame, prominence, or repute would probably have expressed the meaning intended by the host, without insulting his guest. The featured words should not be confused with other words beginning with not-: A person of note has achieved some notice or notability (nouns), that is, distinction, eminence, or importance, but not “notoriety.” The person is no- table or noteworthy (adjectives) but not “notorious.” The implication of badness may or may not apply to inanimate objects: “a notorious gambling house” / “a notori- ously [adverb] soft metal.” NOT REALLY. See REALLY. NOT THAT. See THAT, ALL THAT. NOT TO MENTION. Should we mention this expression at all? It was used as follows in a telecast and a news- paper: These were bikers [motorcyclists] for Dole, not to mention it was a great day to go biking. One of the many oddities in this bat- tered capital is that a son of Gen. Mo- hammed Farah Aidid, the Somali fac- tion leader who humiliated the United States in 1993 , was a naturalized American citizen, not to mention a United States marine. Another oddity is the expression “not to mention.” If one is not to mention some- thing, why does one mention it? At times the phrase is a colloquial substitute for and by the way (which would have suited the first example) or let alone. At other times its purpose is unclear; the item or point that it intro- duces might better be joined to the main idea by and or or. The second example could have said the son “was a natural- ized American citizen and a United States marine.” A book on word usage says of an adverb: . . .

Definition. 2. Noun cre- ations. 3. Number. 4. Omission. 5. Us- ing nouns as adjectives. 1. Definition A noun is the name of something or someone. These are the main kinds: • Proper noun (also called proper name )—the name of a specific person, place, or thing, spelled with an initial capital (Gertrude, Chicago, Acme Laundry). • Its opposite: common noun (also called common name )—a name that represents no specific thing, place, person, etc. but rather a category 254 notoriety, notorious 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 254"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"with multiple specimens (antelope, planet, noise). • Abstract noun— the name of an idea, quality, or state (patience, length, merriment). • Its opposite: concrete noun— the name of an object that one’s senses can perceive (apricot, robin, telephone). • Collective noun— the designation of a group of things or people (team, gang, army). Besides being single words, nouns may be hyphenated words or groups of words (will-o’-the-wisp, human being, scarlet fever). Among other uses, nouns may be sub- jects (“ Rain is falling”), objects (“He hit the target ”), complements (“That lady is her mother ”), and appositives (“Jim, the guide, has arrived”). An appositive is a word or group of words in apposition, i.e., placed beside another to identify or explain it. ( Guide is a noun in apposition with Jim. See also Punctuation, 3A, on commas.) Some words, like love and set, are classified both as nouns and verbs. Other words, although not classified as nouns, can serve the function of nouns. In the sentence “I love eating, ” the last word is a gerund, a verb form acting as a noun. ( See Gerund. ) A word or group of words that serves the function of a noun, whether it is a true noun or its equiva- lent, is called a substantive. 2. Noun creations Using an adjective as a noun in place of a legitimate noun is a contemporary fad, illustrated as follows. A commercial for a shampoo said, “You really can feel the clean.” Asked what an R movie rating meant to him, a child said, “It means in some ways more intense. We like intense.” Perhaps one cannot expect an adver- tiser to care about using the noun clean- ness or cleanliness properly or a ten- year-old to know the noun intensity. However, a radio psychologist should know politeness. She advised a caller to “Just turn on the polite.” And a stand- up comedian should know humility (even if he does not practice it): He called Parisians arrogant and added, “If you want humble, go to Paris, Kentucky.” Those who put on situation comedies are guilty of similar distortions, such as a comedienne’s comment, “It’s not about cute. It’s about pitiful.” Could she and her writers all have been ignorant of the nouns cuteness and pitifulness? Another comedienne said, “I think there are dif- ferent types of pretty”—instead of pretti- ness or beauty. Her counterpart on another show instructed sonny in the different types of “proud.” She needed pride. A supporting actor on still an- other show said, “If you want common, you name a kid John.” The noun is com- monness. Clean, intense, polite, humble, cute, pitiful, pretty, proud, and common are all adjectives, modifiers of nouns but not nouns themselves. Some words that are primarily adjectives legitimately double as substantives; the nouns they would modify are understood: a commercial (announcement); a musical (comedy); the rich and the poor (people). One may speak of the humble, but not of wanting “humble.” The nouns are ripped more painfully from some adjective-noun phrases, in- cluding classified ads, personal ads, and gay man; and the adjectives are dubi- ously made plural: “classifieds” / “per- sonals” / “gays.” ( See also GAY, 3. ) News people create some nouns of their own. In traffic reports, “the road- way is blocked by an overturn” (instead of overturned vehicle ) and “we do have a stall on Highway 24 , eastbound” (not a place for a horse but a substitute for stalled vehicle ). “There are more layers of pretend in nouns 255 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 255"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"‘Waiting for Guffman’ than in most movies,” a critic wrote. “Pretend” is a verb. Pertinent nouns include pretense, pretending, and make-believe. Nouns are sometimes forced into ver- bal roles. See Verbs, 2. 3. Number An elephant has a trunk. Two ele- phants have two trunks. Who could dis- agree? Yet the choice between singular and plural nouns seems to baffle some people, who figuratively attempt to force two elephants to accept one trunk. For example: Both were from Central America and had a visa, but they didn’t have a work permit. A newspaper erred. Two visitors would not share one visa or one work permit. They had visas. They lacked work per- mits. The thing possessed would be sin- gular if the subject of the sentence were singular; for instance: “Each man had a visa but neither had a work permit.” An- other paper made a similar mistake: SEG Technologies Inc. in Philadelphia even invites people to watch their PC being assembled. Just one “PC” for all to share? Make it “their PCs. ” A number of people have a number of the devices, which are, after all, personal computers. A newscaster said, “Cats seem to have a mind of their own.” There is no collec- tive feline mind. “Cats seem to have minds of their own” or “ A cat seems to have a mind of its own.” An author believes that “editors should be required to write a novel.” They would not all collaborate on the same novel. Either “editors should . . . write novels ” or “ an editor should . . . write a novel.” The rule that plural subjects possess plural things has exceptions: • Individuals that constitute a subject may possess something in common: “The Smiths had a lease.” / “Agnes and John met at their college.” • If what is possessed is not a concrete item but an abstract quality, the singular will do: “The cars gained speed.” / “The boys’ anger subsided.” Propriety of number is more than a matter of tidiness. It makes a difference whether Tom and Mary are looking for apartments or an apartment. A grammar rightly points out a bad shift in pronouns: “. . . A [job-seeking] person who interviews a company is more successful . . . than one who waits for a company to interview them. ” This is given as correct: “. . . People who inter- view companies are more successful . . . than those who wait for a company to in- terview them. ” But the second “com- pany” should be made plural too. Two statements on the radio exem- plify an occasional mistake: “We can provide that [neutering] service for dog and cats.” / “Doctors have more bag of tricks. . . .” Dogs and cats. Bags of tricks. Making the final noun plural is not enough. See also Collective nouns; ONE OF, 3. 4. Omission In a complicated sentence telling of multiple actions, sometimes it is not im- mediately clear who or what is perform- ing one of the actions. The writer or speaker has left out a subject (the doer of an action), either a noun or a pronoun, leaving a disconnected predicate (the part of a sentence or clause that tells about the subject).

Using nouns as adjectives Nouns often serve as adjectives: fire insurance; snow removal; spring clean- ing. Such use is not necessarily objection- able. What can be criticized are uses like these: • “The Senate consent to the treaty and its rejection of four amendments . . . was a disappointment to conservatives . . .” (from a news dispatch). “Senate” should be possessive —Senate’s— just as its is possessive. “Senate consent” is headline language. • “She displays both dramatic and music skills.” Dramatic ought to be matched by musical. A standard adjective does not mix well with a noun-adjective. • “. . . Exotic species invasions” / “the biggest selenium discharger” / “a multimillion-dollar aid package” (by two men of science and a news service). Better: invasions of exotic species / discharger of selenium / package of aid. See also Modifiers, 4; Prepositions, 2, 4. NOW. See Anachronism, 2; PRES- ENTLY. NO WAY. Years ago I asked a former flame if she cared to renew our relation- ship. “No way!” she exclaimed. I re- sponded, “Where there’s a will, there’s a way.” She amended her answer: “No will.” At least I had the satisfaction of winning her concession on a point of En- glish usage. In popular use, “No way” often sub- stitutes for a more straightforward nega- tive like no or not. At times it stands alone as an interjection. At other times it is stuck onto sentences crudely—often inaccurately as well, for frequently there is a way. The form in which the expression reached my ears at the start of the seven- ties was “in no way.” Before long, the “in” was being dropped and the uttering of “no way” became a fad. The example is from a restaurant review: No way am I hungry after this meal; not for at least 8 hours. An improved version, “ In no way am I hungry after this meal for at least 8 hours,” adds in and deletes “not.” ( See Double negative. ) A still better version scraps “no way” and relocates three words: I am not hungry after this meal for at least eight hours. [Most publica- tions spell out the digits.] The following sentence opens a news brief: There’s no way Reagan will accept an invitation by leaders of South Africa’s neighboring black states to visit the region in an attempt to end the violence. To keep the first three words but make the sentence minimally grammatical, ex- tra words are needed to connect the noun phrase “no way” to the verb “accept”; for instance: “There’s no way in which Reagan will accept . . .” or “There’s no way to get Reagan to accept. . . .” But was there truly no possible condition un- der which he would accept? The best so- lution might be to toss out the first three words and insert not: no way 257 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 257"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"Reagan will not accept an invita- tion by leaders of South Africa’s neighboring black states. . . .

Noway or noways is an old adverb, meaning in no manner or by no means and pronounced with stress on no-. The two-word version either stresses way or gives the two words about equal stress. These are correct examples from The Oxford English Dictionary: “They were tied up and could noways appear” ( 1702 ). “I have lived a virgin and I noway doubt I can live so still” ( 1875 ). A synonym of noway is nowise or, more commonly, in no wise. NUCLEAR. Nuclear is pronounced NOO-klee-urr. Sometimes it is mispro- nounced “NOO-kyuh-lurr,” and some of the mispronouncers are people who should know better: a secretary of de- fense was heard uttering it the latter way seventeen times in one interview. Presi- dent Eisenhower was said to have habit- ually given the word the same twist. (Maybe there ought to be a law saying that nobody shall have any control over weapons that he cannot pronounce.) Nuclear, in the sense of pertaining to weapons and energy, its predominant sense, is now more common than its syn- onym, atomic, the original term. Basi- cally nuclear (adjective) pertains to a nucleus (noun): a center or core around which things are collected. The nucleus, in biology, is a body of protoplasm within an animal or plant cell that is es- sential to such functions as growth and reproduction. In chemistry and physics it is the central part of an atom, includes protons and neutrons among its parts, and makes up nearly all the atom’s mass. Either nuclei or nucleuses serves as a plu- ral. Two terms that look and sound rather similar but have significant differences are nuclear fission, the principle of the atomic bomb and civil atomic energy, and nuclear fusion, the principle of the hydrogen bomb. In fission, the nuclei of atoms are split; in the process, part of their mass is converted to energy. In fu- sion, the nuclei of atoms fuse into heav- ier nuclei (e.g., tritium, or heavy hydrogen, into helium), but the total mass is less and the balance is converted into energy.

Tree, woman, and this are in the singular number, whereas trees, women, and these are in the plural number. A subject and its verb must agree in number; for instance, “ A tree stands in the yard” but “ Two trees stand in the yard.” Among entries dealing with number in a grammatical sense are the following: AMOUNT and NUMBER; BE- TWEEN, 2; Collective nouns; Contrac- tions, 1; COUPLE; EACH, EACH OF; EACH OTHER; EITHER, 1, 2; EVERY- BODY, EVERYONE, 4; EVERY ONE and EVERYONE; Expletives; FEWER and LESS; LATTER; LOT, 1; MAJOR- ITY, 2; MANY and MUCH; MORE THAN ONE; NEITHER, 3; NONE, 1; NOR; Nouns, 3; ONE OF; OR; PER- SONNEL; PLUS; Pronouns, 2; STAFF; TOTAL, 2; TRIO; Verbs, 3; See also Plurals and singulars with ref- erences listed in 2L.

Ambiguity “Building permits were down six point eight percent in October,” a news- caster announced. “Down” from what? Were they down from what they had been in September, or were they down from what they had been in October of the previous year? The newscaster, on network television, failed to say. Further- more, was she referring to the total num- ber of permits or to the total of esti- mated costs? We do not know. The “six point eight percent” hinted at a precision that was not there. When comparisons are made, it must be clear what is being compared to what. When totals are presented, it must be clear what items have been added up. See Comparison, 1. A man saw “between four and five hundred people” at a place. What was the smallest number of people he saw there at any time? It is plausible that if he was the fifth to arrive, he saw four there at first. The context, in a biography, indi- cates that the writer meant four hundred but omitted hundred. This was heard on television news: “Estimates range from 250 to 400 , 000 .” This time we cannot figure it out. We must guess. It is likely that the speaker meant 250 thousand but omitted thou- sand. To save one word, the author and the news man each risked misinterpretation. 2. Contradiction It is a serious problem when numbers contradict their interpretation, as in the two press examples that follow. . . . The southwestern neighborhoods rejected the ballot measure 9 , 323 votes against to 17 , 251 in favor. The number of marriage licenses is also down in Louisiana, the only other state that requires premarital AIDS testing. In the first quarter of 1988 776 marriage licenses were is- sued in New Orleans, the only parish monitored by the State Department of Health, as against 628 the previous year .... In the first excerpt, the figures contradict “rejected.” The second excerpt shows the figures going up, not “down.” (It has three lesser flaws: For one thing, running numbers 259 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 259"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"two successive figures risks confusion; this year could have replaced the date. Then too, “the previous year” is not usu- ally used for last year. Anyway, it lacks a qualification, like during the correspond- ing period. ) It is equally troublesome when two numbers contradict each other, as in the next two extracts. An article attributes a number to “in- dustry analysts” and a second number, ten paragraphs later, to “some esti- mates”: They estimate, however, that there are fewer than 20 , 000 fax machines in American homes. . . . By some estimates, there are more than 20 million people working at home with a facsimile machine .... The two estimates differ by a factor of more than 1 , 000 . Yet we are offered no explanation of that remarkable discrep- ancy (let alone how 20 million people can share “a facsimile machine” —see Nouns, 3 ). Where was the copy editor when the following passage went into the paper? A 31 -year old man fell six stories from a window ledge down a light well while attempting to gain access to his apartment early yesterday. San Francisco Police said that T—— G——, 27 , of 250 F—— Street either locked himself out or had been locked out by his roommate. The four-year discrepancy is glaring, granted that a harrowing experience can age one. (By the way, a hyphen is missing after “ 31 -year.” And we may wonder why a news story has to begin with such an insignificant detail, particularly when the very next sentence includes that de- tail. A far more important fact, the vic- tim’s “guarded condition,” was relegated to the third paragraph.) Although the final example does not leave us readers puzzled, the way it is ex- pressed may be questioned. In addition, Mr. Dukakis’s adminis- tration announced last week that tax revenue would be as much as $ 77 mil- lion less than anticipated, creating a potential deficit in the nearly $ 11 bil- lion budget for 1988 . “As much as” lifts us. “Less than antici- pated” drops us. That roller-coaster ef- fect could have been avoided, for instance by changing “would be as much as” to could fall to or by simply chang- ing “much” to little. 3. Division between lines When a figure and a word together represent a number, particularly a dollar amount (like $ 3 billion), both elements should go on the same line, unlike these two examples: By last month, more than $ 2 million of this fiscal year’s $ 2 . 5 million overtime budget had already been paid out. . . . . . . He does not know how much of a subsidy the east hotel would get but it would not be “significantly less” than the $ 17 million awarded to the Hilton. Separating “$ 2 ” or $ 17 ” from “million” is likely to impede readers. See also Division of words. 4. Impossibility The statements quoted below cannot literally be true. They imply calculations that are impossible. First an excerpt from a news article: ...T ests of apple products from two education department ware- houses showed that they contained 260 numbers 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 260"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"levels 400 times lower than federal limits. . . . Some tests showed the products at 1 , 000 to 10 , 000 times lower than allowable limits. Inasmuch as one time lower is zero, “ 400 times lower” defies the imagina- tion, let alone “ 1 , 000 to 10 , 000 times lower.” Could the levels (of a pesticide) found in the tests have been one four- hundredth of the limits, one thousandth of the limits, and so on? A magazine ad for a computer com- pany (not Apple) makes a similarly im- possible claim: . . . Our latest microprocessor tech- nology requires each transistor to be 100 times thinner than a human hair. The statement is corrected by a caption elsewhere in the ad: “ 1 / 100 th the thick- ness of a human hair.” A book on science says that a film of oil was “on average ten or twenty times thinner” than gold leaf. One-tenth or one-twentieth as thin? Later the spacial separation of atomic layers of gold is judged to be “two dozen times less than the minimum thickness we found so eas- ily for an oil film upon water.” One twenty-fourth as large? (The consistency of “on average” [a mean?] and “ten or twenty” [a range?] is a lesser question.) A well-known anchor man an- nounced to the nation the incredible news that “U.S. farm exports declined more than 300 percent last year” (pre- sumably from the year before). If farm exports had declined 100 percent, all farm exports would have ceased. Could someone have typed an extra zero in the copy that he read? 5. Inaccuracy What we see in print is not necessarily so. Most of us know that and still tend to trust the printed word. Like everyone else, a professional writer can get a fact or figure wrong. Usually a copy editor reviews his work, but errors do sneak by, particularly those that cannot be cor- rected without specially researched background information. The cause of a mistake may be absent- mindedness, carelessness, faulty mem- ory, haste, ignorance, inadequate research or thought, miscalculation, mis- understanding, repetition of another’s error, slip of the keyboard, or a combi- nation of the foregoing. It may be “just one of those things” and truly “everyone makes mistakes,” as we often say. What- ever the reason, it does not justify infect- ing readers with misinformation, which can be passed on to others in viral fash- ion. A news service circulated a factual mistake far and wide: Syria, along with Egypt and Jor- dan, lost territory to Israel in the 1967 seven-day war and was known to have adopted a hard line on getting the lost ground back. The Israelis fought the war in six days, hence the well-known appellation the Six-Day War. (On the seventh day they rested.) The same news service reported this startling intelligence: “Seven out of every ten married Italians commit adultery.” It based its report on a survey of 1 , 000 families by the weekly magazine L’Euro- pea showing that “ 49 percent of the men and 21 percent of the women” admitted the sin. The service was wrong, even if we assume that the survey was reliable, that it represented all Italians, and that half of them were men and half women. Adulterers then would make up 35 per- cent of married Italians, or seven out of twenty. Evidently someone had simply added 49 and 21 , forgetting that 100 percent of each sex made up only 50 per- cent of the total. numbers 261 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 261"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"A newspaper item told of nuns with a convent at the scene of the former Auschwitz death camp, “where they pray for the thousands who died in the Nazi Holocaust.” How could any writer or editor on the staff of a large metropolitan daily be ignorant of the fact that the Nazis murdered millions? The sentence below is extracted from an earlier issue of the same newspaper. What the writer apparently lacked (and his copy editor failed to provide) was not factual knowledge but the ability to di- vide sixty-five by six. There are about six phones per 100 persons in the Soviet Union, which is less than one-fifth the American ratio of 65 per 100 . But then they probably surpassed us in arithmetic. See also 10B . 6. Inanity Some writers can find no other way to compare figures than to state the obvi- ous. The first example deals with Nicaragua. . . . The country’s per capita gross domestic product has fallen to roughly $ 300 a year. That figure is less than the comparable figure of $ 330 a year for Haiti, long the hemisphere’s poorest nation. Industrial accidents in the Soviet Union killed 14 , 377 people last year. . . . That’s more than the 13 , 833 troops the Soviets say they lost in eight years of fighting in Afghanistan. Can there possibly be any reader who does not know that $ 300 is less than $ 330 or that 14 , 377 is more than 13 , 833 ? See also FRACTION. 7. Incomparability The quoted sentence, from a well- known work, purports to compare the incomparable. Among the browsers, for example, was the Diplodocus carnegii, which measured eighty-four feet in length. The Brachiosaurus was still more colossal—it had a live weight of about fifty tons! We could compare the two dinosaurs in length if we knew how long the Bra- chiosaurus was. We could compare them in weight if we knew how much the Diplodocus weighed. All we have is the length of one and the weight of the other, and how can these be compared? In the following example, from a press article, the problem may lie in the writing, rather than in the data. . . . U.S. postal employees handle an average of 190 , 000 pieces of mail per year, compared to just 50 , 000 pieces of mail per employee in West Ger- many. It appears that U.S. pieces “per year” is being compared with German pieces “per employee.” A year and an em- ployee are incomparable. Probably the writer intended to compare the number of mail pieces per U.S. employee per year with the number of mail pieces per Ger- man employee per year. But he did not say so. When numbers are to be compared with one another, it must be made clear that they are in the same category. One should not assume that the reader or lis- tener will make the proper assumptions. See also AS and LIKE, 2; Comparison, 2; LIKE, 2; UNLIKE, 2. Anyhow, the 190 , 000 cannot be com- pared “to” the 50 , 000 . See COM- PARED TO and COMPARED WITH, 1. 262 numbers 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 262"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"8. Incompleteness Percent, or per cent, as it is also writ- ten, or %, as it is symbolized, means parts of 100 . In any pie chart, or its equivalent in prose, all 100 parts must be accounted for. Someone in an edito- rial office should have performed a little simple arithmetic: Already 76 percent of Bergen’s land is covered by private and public devel- opment. With 15 percent preserved as golf courses and public parkland, only 5 . 9 percent, or 9 , 000 acres, remains in private hands, still open to either de- velopment or preservation. Those percentages total 96 . 9 . Nothing is said about the remaining 3 . 1 . (The paragraph is otherwise unclear. “. . . Only 5 . 9 percent . . . remains in pri- vate hands” produces confusion. Part of the 76 % is land in private hands too. This may be what the writer meant: “. . . Only 5 . 9 percent, 9 , 000 acres in private hands, remains open to either develop- ment or preservation.”) An editor doubtless did not intend to put a misleading headline on a front page: “ ‘Friendly fire’ killed 1 in 5 GIs in gulf war.” It suggests that about 100 , 000 of the approximately half a million U.S. servicemen in the war died at the hands of their comrades. It fails to indicate that “ 1 in 5 ” is a fraction of U.S. battle deaths, said to total 148 . This is one of many possible amendments (taking up no additional space): “U.S. fire hit 1 in 5 GIs slain in gulf war.” The ranking of entities as first, second, ninth, and so on can be too short of ex- planatory facts. See Comparison, 1. 9. In lawsuits In filing lawsuits, lawyers routinely in- flate the damages. They do not seriously expect to win the full amounts re- quested. They know that a judgment for the plaintiff or a settlement almost al- ways sharply cuts the amount sought in the complaint. News reporters and editors generally do not know this. They tend to rate the importance of a suit according to the sum of money requested. So ordinarily the best way for a lawyer to get a suit in the news is to ask for absurdly exorbi- tant damages. The amount of the suit will appear in the opening sentence of the story—each of the sample sentences below—and often in the headline as well. Dr. Sam Sheppard’s former wife has filed a $ 10 million lawsuit against the National Broadcasting Co. over the television network’s dramatization of her husband’s murder trials. A Marina service station operator filed a $ 20 million damage suit against Texaco Inc., accusing the oil company of coercing him into selling only Texaco products. Financier J. William Oldenburg has filed a $ 400 million suit against three newspapers . . . alleging libel. . . . Real estate investor Richard Traweek, his legislative attempts to convert 720 apartments to condo- miniums blocked, filed a $ 800 million lawsuit against San Francisco yester- day. [ See also A and AN. ] The point here is not that any suits are unjustified or justified but that journal- ists are dupes for lawyers. 10. Misinterpretation A. Percentage of increase An editorial said, erroneously: Carousel expenditures will soon go up 400 percent. . . . The 25 -cent ticket would be eliminated for children, who numbers 263 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 263"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"would pay the same dollar fare as their moms. When an item costing a quarter doubles in price, it rises another quarter, or one time, or 100 percent. When it triples in price, it rises 50 cents, or two times, or 200 percent. A 25 -cent ticket that in- creases to a dollar goes up 75 cents, or three times, or 300 percent—not “ 400 .” (Incidentally, the writer seems uncertain whether it “will” [definitely] or “would” [maybe] go up. See Mood; Subjunctive. See also MOM, MAMA, MA. ) The same erroneous percentage ap- peared in a periodic column: The current fee for a basic, minimum plumbing permit is now $ 15 . 75 . The fee, starting Sept. 4 , will be $ 65 . 25 , and up—a 400 percent increase. When a fee of $ 15 . 75 goes up $ 49 . 50 , the increase is 314 percent—not “ 400 .” B. Comparison Henry earns $ 500 a week. Wendy earns $ 1 , 500 . These are two ways in which one may compare the two num- bers: • Contrast the totals, figuring the number of times $ 500 goes into $ 1 , 500 . (“Wendy earns three times as much as Henry earns” or “His earnings are a third of hers.”) • Emphasize the difference, $ 1 , 000 . (“Wendy earns two times more than what Henry earns” or “Her earnings are 200 percent higher than his.”) X times more or bigger, higher, greater, etc. ( than ) is not the same as X times as many or as big, as high, as much, etc. ( as ). Either type of description is valid if used consistently and accu- rately. The defective example below is from a newspaper’s main story. . . . The Bush proposals would re- quire the Warsaw Pact to destroy eight times more planes and four times as many helicopters [as NATO]. The proposals called for the destruction of 4 , 850 and 577 planes respectively. One bloc would destroy 7 . 4 times more planes than the other, or roughly seven times—not “eight” times. The helicopter part was correct. More means greater in number, amount, etc. Thus X “times more planes” deals only with the times that are greater than one time. In the example above, the 577 NATO planes amount to one time. The first 577 planes of the other side are numerically the same, not “more,” so they should not be counted. As many implies that the larger num- ber has been divided by the smaller num- ber. A proposed NATO destruction of 419 helicopters goes into the other side’s figure of 1 , 700 about four times. So the latter would indeed destroy “four times as many helicopters” or four times the number of helicopters or would be bound to a fourfold destruction of heli- copters compared with NATO’s obliga- tion. An advertisement for a silver medal- lion said: The standard American Eagle weighs merely one troy ounce. . . . “Silver Ea- gle” is an astonishing 16 times heav- ier . . . ( 16 Oz. Troy . . .). Correction: 16 times as heavy but 15 times heavier. The moderator of a television forum said, and it was simultaneously dis- played on the screen, that Indonesia was “Three times bigger than Texas” in land area. Correction: Indonesia, with about 741 , 000 square miles, is about 1 . 8 times bigger than Texas, with about 267 , 000 square miles. Indonesia is about 2 . 8 times as big as Texas. 264 numbers 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 264"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"This sentence, from a book of popular astronomy, is inconsistent in its terms (and contains several other errors): Uranus is 15 times as far from the sun as the Earth; Neptune, 17 times; and Pluto is 50 times farther. The sentence uses “as far as” twice and then switches to “farther.” Is there a rea- son for the switch, or is the writer simply unaware of the distinction? A reader cannot tell. (Anyway, all the numbers are wrong. On the average, the three planets are 19 , 30 , and 39 times as far from the Sun as the Earth is. An is after “Earth” is desirable to clarify that only distances from the outer planets to the Sun, not to the Earth, are being compared. An “is” after Pluto is superfluous when no “is” follows Neptune. See also Series errors, 9; STAR and SUN. ) C. CHANCES, PROBABILITY, ODDS Does the retired general who is quoted here approve or disapprove of the operation? I would have rated Desert One’s chances of success at a hundred to one. . . . He seems to be estimating a hundred chances of success to one chance of fail- ure. But the sentence concludes by call- ing the chances foolhardy odds for a military opera- tion. He meant to have rated the chances of failure at a hundred to one (chance of success), or the chance of success at about one in a hundred. The context in the following sentence, by a scientist, explains what he had in mind, although literally the sentence says the opposite. The probability of all the gas mole- cules in our first box being found in one half of the box at a later time is many millions of millions to one, but it can happen. The probability of winning the state lot- tery is one (chance) in millions. The probability that the sun will come out tomorrow somewhere in the world is many millions of millions (of chances) to one (chance that it will not)—the same as the probability of gas molecules being in both halves of the box. The meaning in the sentence below is harder to discern. First of all, the sen- tence makes no sense grammatically. Changing “were” to at would help the grammar. But something more is wrong. He [a state criminalist] also testified that the combined test results put the odds that the blood on socks found in Simpson’s bedrooms [sic] was not that of his ex-wife were 21 billion to 1 , up from the 9 . 7 billion to 1 odds Cotton gave last week. Odds means probability, likelihood, or chances of a given event happening or a given thing being. If the chances of the blood not being his ex-wife’s were “ 21 billion to 1 ” (chance of its being his ex- wife’s), it would seem to be almost cer- tain that the blood was someone else’s. Contrasted with previous testimony, it would mean improved odds for Simp- son. But the source of the figures was tes- timony for the prosecution, and the headline read “State’s odds against O.J. keep growing.” Here is one way to revise the sentence: ...T est results put the likelihood that the blood . . . was not that of his ex-wife at only one chance in 21 bil- lion—less than half of the one chance in 9 . 7 billion that Cotton estimated last week. In other words, the proba- numbers 265 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 265"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"bility that the blood came from the murdered woman appeared even greater now. The chances, probability, or odds of one’s misunderstanding numerical infor- mation of this sort are high enough to warrant a cautious treatment by the writer or speaker. D. The superlative It pays to think twice before describ- ing a number by a superlative, like the biggest, the smallest, or the highest. Adding a modifier like “ever” or “of all time” is especially risky. Too often some- one comes along to point out something bigger, smaller, higher, etc. A main headline described an action in the House of Representatives: “As- sault Weapons Ban OKd By the Narrow- est of Margins.” The narrowest of margins would be one vote. The story re- ported a tally of 216 to 214 . Thus the winning margin was two votes—twice as large a margin as the “Narrowest.” E. AVERAGE Average in a numerical sense does not mean typical. Average (noun) is the com- mon term for what is, more precisely, a mean (also called an arithmetic mean or arithmetical mean ): the result of adding two or more quantities and dividing the sum by the number of quantities added. It does not necessarily resemble any individual quantity. If four employees out of five are paid $ 25 , 000 a year each and the fifth is paid $ 100 , 000 , the aver- age (adjective) or mean salary is $ 40 , 000 , an amount unlike the salary of any employee in the company. That sta- tistical reality is not always grasped by those interpreting numerical facts. See also LIFE EXPECTANCY (etc.); MEAN (noun). 11. Spelling out When should numbers be represented by words, when by figures? To answer that question and others, the press has style rules that aim at consistency, but their mindless enforcement can lead to inconsistency. This is from an account of a baseball game: Twenty-seven Dodgers came up, 27 Dodgers went down. There were 17 groundouts, five strikeouts, two foul outs, and only three fair balls hit out of the infield. It seems that the Dodgers came up as words but went down as figures. The ex- planation lies in an age-old press rule: Do not start a sentence with a figure. No rationale for that rule is ever advanced. Headlines often start with figures; for ex- ample: “ 36 hours of work piled on aver- age desk.” The second “ 27 ” and the “ 17 ” are ex- pressed in figures, the remaining num- bers in words, because of another style rule, common among newspapers: It re- quires figures for numbers above nine (except at the start of sentences) and words for numbers of nine and under. The rule includes both cardinal numbers (nine planets, a family of 10 ) and ordinal numbers (the fourth dimension, the 18 th hole). Exceptions are made for decimal numbers (a 3 . 7 average), sums of money ($ 8 ), statistical tables, and so on. Book editors often follow The Chicago Manual of Style, which calls for figures for 100 or more but also rejects them at the start of sentences, giving no reason. When spelled out, compound num- bers through ninety-nine and fractions commonly take hyphens: “Three hun- dred forty-seven residents” / “About two-thirds of all animals.” See also HALF. When a hundred or a thousand serves as an adjective—“a hundred yards” / “a thousand clowns”—it should be spelled out. “A 100 ” or “a 1 , 000 ,” as writers 266 numbers 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 266"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"sometimes put it, is the equivalent of “a one-hundred” or “a one-thousand.” Apart from the use of numbers, the first sentence of the baseball quotation is defective. It contains the makings of two sentences (two independent clauses) divided by a comma, an inadequate punctuation. ( See Run-on Sentence, 2. ) Below, we fix the punctuation, strengthen the message by expressing it in parallel sentences, and still observe the initial-number rule: Twenty-seven Dodgers came up. Twenty-seven Dodgers went down. (There is still another inconsistency in the passage. While “groundouts” and “strikeouts” take one word each, two words are allotted to “foul outs.” In an adjoining box, tabulating the statistics of the game, it is “foulouts.”) numbers 267 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 267"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"Object(ive) complement.

While the courts have labored over the precise meaning of obscenity and the definition has determined whether people are sent to jail, the mass media, some public offi- cials, and others have been stretching their constructions of the word to the point of inanity. A banner headline proclaimed “An ‘obscene’ state deficit.” The story under- neath quoted a state treasurer: “The ‘ob- scene surplus’ I spoke of four years ago has turned into an ‘obscene deficit’. . . .” An interviewer asked people on the street for “An Example of Obscene Wealth.” A legislator said that revenues should not accumulate to “obscene lev- els.” A columnist wrote of “obscene profits” from drugs, and another colum- nist wrote that “total compensation of top execs at some corporations is so large it borders on the obscene.” In the examples above, “obscene” was forced to serve as a general pejora- tive for a variety of monetary condi- tions. But money or the lack of it is not “obscene” (even though people may speak of “filthy lucre”). Nor is, say, theft, although it may be bad, wrong, evil, vicious, or vile. In the pair of examples below, “ob- scene” and “obscenely” are made to deal with people’s ingestion of sub- stances. To a food writer, being “ob- scene” seems to be a good thing: She credited an intensified flavor and sweet- ness of homemade jam to “the obscene amount of sugar that goes into its mak- ing.” In a discussion of vitamins, a radio doctor asked, “Are we doing any good by taking obscenely large amounts of the chemicals?” A television exposé of fake going-out- of-business sales included this comment: “What made it a sham was that the sale ran an obscene length of time, almost eleven months.” The o- words have nothing to do with money, consumption, or time. Obscen- ity (noun) is that which is obscene (ad- jective): offensive to generally accepted standards of modesty or decency; in par- ticular, filthy, disgusting, or indecent in representing sexual or excretory parts or functions by word, deed, or illustration. Obscenely (adverb) means in an obscene way or to the point of obscenity. Exactly where the lines are drawn and what is placed within them and by whom are up to the judiciary. You can be accused of “obscenity” even if you do nothing.

Two nouns associated with obscenity are vulgarity, meaning coarseness, poor taste, impropriety, or an act or expres- sion with those characteristics; and pro- fanity, strictly speaking, irreverence to that which is sacred, or an instance of such irreverence, popularly used as a synonym for obscenity. OBSESS, OBSESSED, OBSES- SION. To obsess someone is to be- siege, beset, dominate, haunt, or trouble the person. Nowadays it always pertains to the way a persistent feeling, idea, thought, or the like can act on the mind. Often it is in the passive voice: “Gertrude was obsessed with guilt.” / “Edison was obsessed by the vision of his lamp.” It may be in the active voice too, as in this press example: . . . The show looks at how the con- cept of stardom can inspire or obsess an artist. . . . One thing the verb obsess may not be is intransitive, as it was forced to be on two national television programs: [News:] BBC viewers are obsessing about something else [besides the Bea- tles: Princess Diana]. [Drama:] It’s that dog he’s been ob- sessing about. Change “obsessing about” to obsessed by or with. The verb is transitive. Some- thing obsesses one, or (more often) one is obsessed by or with something. One does not “obsess” any more than one “besieges.” Obsess once meant besiege in a literal sense. It came from the Latin obsessus, past participle of obsidere, to besiege or beset. The noun is obsession: the action of obsessing (someone) or the state of being obsessed; or the influence of the persis- tent idea etc.; or the idea etc. itself. “His obsession with presidential politics en- dured for decades.” / “Fashion obses- sions afflict many girls.” OCCUR. See HAPPEN, OCCUR, and TAKE PLACE. OCTOPUS. See Plurals and singulars, 1. OCULIST, OPHTHALMOLO- GIST, OPTICIAN, and OP- TOMETRIST. All are concerned with eyes. Oculist is an old term for an ophthalmologist, a medical doctor who specializes in treating eye disorders. An optometrist is not a physician but a per- son holding the degree of Doctor of Op- tometry (O.D.) who tests the eyes for vision problems and prescribes eye- glasses. An optician makes or sells opti- cal products. A dispensing optician deals in prescribed eyeglasses. The Greek word for eye, ophthalmos, gave rise to numerous technical terms. Medical dictionaries contain more than fifty of them, including ophthalmia, se- vere inflammation of the eye; oph- thalmic, pertaining to the eye, e.g., the ophthalmic nerve; ophthalmology, the science and medical specialty of the eye and its diseases; and ophthalmoscope, an instrument for examining the interior of the eye. Note that all have at least two h ’s. (A few, like the twenty-letter disease ophthalmoblennorrhea, have three h ’s.) The first one was missing from ophthal- mologists in an op-ed article of mine. The editor had knocked the h out of it. OD.

OD (noun or verb, which looks odd but is pronounced OH-DEE) means overdose in police and medical jargon, not in standard English. OD’ing means overdosing. The Random House Dictionary oddly fails to include any definition under overdose (which it dates from the seven- teenth century); instead it refers readers to OD ( 1955 to 1960 ) and defines that. OD as an abbreviation (often with dots) can stand for many things, includ- ing doctor of optometry, officer of the day, Old Dutch, ordnance department, outside diameter, overdraft, overdrawn, and the right eye (from the Latin oculus dexter, used on prescriptions). -ODD.

Draw- back. 3. Other expressions. 1. Benefit Sometimes a statement seems obvious but needs to be stated anyway. The com- mon phrase of course lets us state the ob- vious without sounding pedagogic or preachy or insulting anyone’s intelli- gence. What is stated may be a fact or truism that puts things into perspective or leads up to one’s main point: “He made his discovery in 1776 , which of course was the year of our Declaration of Indepen- dence.” / “Of course, you shouldn’t put all your eggs in one basket. Farnsworth did so and this is what happened to him.” Using of course in that way tells the reader or listener, “You’re smart enough to know this, but it is helpful to the dis- cussion if I mention it anyway.” 2. Drawback Occasionally, instead of avoiding in- sult, the use of “of course” produces it. A listener asks a speaker a question; the answer should be “yes,” but the speaker answers “of course,” as though to say: “You’re a dummy for asking.” Or a writer attaches an “of course” to an ob- scure fact or arguable proposition, thereby implying to a number of readers that they are dolts for not knowing what the writer knows. The three quoted statements that fol- low, from three books, are scarcely the epitome of everyday conversation. None gives any clue as to why it warrants “of course.” First, a traveler describes an Al- gerian repast of which he partook: “We started with dates, of course, and drank milk.” (Why must a meal start with dates?) A musicologist tells the general public, “. . . Berlioz, of course, made lib- eral use of the instrument,” the harp. (Why is that presumed to be an obvious fact?) Last, a cosmologist writes about a theory of multiple universes: Only in a small number, with condi- tions and parameters like our own universe, will it be possible for intelli- gent life to develop and ask the ques- tion, “Why is the universe as we observe it?” The answer, of course, is that if it were otherwise, there would not be anyone to ask the question. It is unclear why that answer should be accepted as a matter of course. Maybe 270 -odd 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 270"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"the question could be answered in an as- tronomic, rather than philosophic, way.

Other expressions There are some other phrases that are similar to “of course” in patronizing character but less useful, if indeed they should be used at all. One of them ap- pears in a renowned book. (Emphasis is added to the excerpts below.) The English, as everyone knows, usu- ally put a comma after the street num- ber of a house, making it, for example, 34, St. James’s Street. If everyone knew it, would the author have felt it necessary to give the exam- ple? Related phrases are “as everybody knows” and “as is well known.” Another expression in a similar vein is found in a widely used manual for au- thors and editors: It goes without saying that author- date citations in the text must agree exactly with the list of references. If something really “goes without say- ing” or, to use a related expression, is “needless to say,” why say it? What the manual says, however, seems worth say- ing. See Verbal unmentionables. Two other expressions of a compara- ble, patronizing character are “for the simple reason that” and “it stands to reason.” See REASON, 3. OFF and “OFF OF.” A talk show host objected to giving driver’s licenses to anyone illiterate in English. What if you can’t read the signs on the freeway and “don’t know what exit to get off of?” In his comment, he displayed less than full proficiency in English himself. The “of” should have been at. “Off of” is a substandard phrase. “Of” is superfluous; its sense is included in off. The “of” intrudes often in conver- sations and at times in broadcasting and print. A reporter on a TV network said, “Moving people into jobs and off of wel- fare demands that there be jobs to go to.” The “of” was wrong; off welfare would have been right. The mistake glared in a front-page headline: “Gingrich wants wealthy re- tirees off of Medicare.” Off Medicare needed no “of.” Nor should “of” have intruded in this sentence, from a dis- patch by a news agency: “That [infusion with carbonate grains] would have hap- pened during the impact that knocked the meteorite off of Mars.” Off Mars. The four extracts below from newspa- pers all contain the same error: “Mar- tinez’s car hit the rear of one car, glanced off of it and struck another car.” / “That limits the number of objects off of which radar energy can bounce.” / “Mr. Courter’s campaign, coming off of a tough primary . . . , suffered from poor organization. . . .” / “The Department . . . added staff to help General Assistance clients get off of local welfare rolls. . . .” In every instance, off is enough: “. . . glanced off it . . .” / “. . . objects off which . . .” / “. . . coming off a tough primary . . .” / “. . . get off local welfare rolls. . . .” The final example, from a column, is a bit different: “Gabbert broadcasts off of Mount San Bruno south of The City. . . .” Change “off of” to from. (And insert a comma after “Bruno.” As for the capital T in “The,” not the writer but a quirk of his newspaper was to blame.) OFF and ON.

It made typi- cal appearances in announcements of two television programs to be shown and in an argument by the host of a ra- dio talk show: “plus a new look at the world’s oldest profession, prostitution” / “a provocative look at the world’s oldest profession . . .” / “The idea of trying to outlaw the world’s oldest profession is ridiculous.” Is there any truth in the “oldest pro- fession” cliché? First of all, prostitution, the selling of sexual services, is not a pro- fession in the standard sense: a vocation requiring much advanced study and training, in the practice of which one is relied on for one’s knowledge and judg- ment. The professions once meant theol- ogy, law, and medicine. That leaves the question, What is the oldest vocation or occupation? Writings in anthropology suggest that the earliest beings that walked upright subsisted by scavenging, gathering, and hunting. Fishing and animal husbandry entered at some points, tillage later. Prostitution was not in the running. Anyway, could prostitutes have gone into business if there were not men who had earned the money to pay them? ON. 1. Missing. 2. Superfluous. 3. Uni- diomatic. 1. Missing The preposition on gets pushed around: left out when it should be in, put in when it should be out, and over- worked when another preposition would do a better job. To omit on, as newspapers are apt to do, can make a sentence unclear: “He met Billy Sunday.” / “He hired his man Friday.” If we are referring to days and not people’s appellations, precede each day with on. A press example follows. State court Judge Lawrence Weiss Friday sentenced Mr. B—— to 10 years in state prison. . . . “ On Friday” would clarify that “Fri- day” is not the judge’s last name. The sentence would read still more smoothly if it began “ On Friday .... ” On would suit the start of the following press sen- tence too. His first day as principal of South Boston High School, Jerome W—— received a poetic greeting from white residents opposed to desegregating their neighborhood’s school. The meaning is clear, but it would be more idiomatic to say “ On his first day. . . .” Without the on, the reader could start out on the wrong track, ex- pecting something like “His first day as principal was exciting.” On does not always need to precede a day or date, but it cannot hurt. “He came Thursday” or “He came on Thurs- day.” / “The fiscal year ends June 30 ” or “The fiscal year ends on June 30 .” A faddish expression at this writing is “Get a grip.” A grip on what (on a prob- lem? on oneself?) is not explained. It is literally telling someone to obtain a suit- case. 2. Superfluous The needless appearance of “on” plays a part in contemporary slang. Up often gets “on” added when up would be enough by itself. A column of letters to the editor was headlined “U.S. Should Stop Beating Up on Cuba.” And this was said in a tele- vised documentary: “Orson constantly picked up on those things [reports of his genius] and accepted them as true.” In each case, on could have been dropped with no detriment to the meaning.

There was no need for “on to.” A witness was quoted: “He was wait- ing on every second for the police to ar- rive. He couldn’t wait to see them.” Dropping on would help the first sen- tence. (But if “he was waiting,” how is it that “He couldn’t wait”?) Seeking a home for a cat, a humane society ran an ad that began, “Cat lovers should count on their blessings.” Count their ( our, your, etc.) blessings is the ex- pression. “On” was ill chosen. To count on is to depend on (something or some- one). 3. Unidiomatic On has become a highly popular tool of the press, usurping functions that most of us would reserve for other prepositions. In headlines it is nearly an all-purpose preposition. Take this head- line, across a page: Shelley backs off on Brown’s ballot measure Off and “on” seem contradictory. A more normal preposition with back off (meaning to retreat) is from. Here are five more headlines (with possible replacements in brackets): U.S. to take Russia to task on [for?] Chechnya RUSSIA TELLS NATO IT ACCEPTS OFFER ON [OF?] A FORMAL LINK Wilson backs floor fight on [over?] abortion Ruling lets activists pursue warning on [of?] mercury fillings Ex-Klansmen to Take Classes on [in?] Civil Rights Space limitation only partly explains the press’s fondness for on. In print it is slightly longer than of and in, two prepositions that it sometimes supplants. Reliance on on seems to be habitual with some copy editors, easier than having to select the best preposition. Equally unid- iomatic “on” phrases are sometimes found in other media. This is from a scholarly book: [E]vans said its [a dictionary’s] pur- pose was to give the reader help on spelling, pronunciation, and the meaning and proper use of words. Would we not want “help in spelling” et cetera? To stand or wait on line is a regional idiom of New York City, seen in writing produced there. Most of the country speaks of standing or waiting in line. A certain actress “has never before been ‘butt naked’ onscreen,” an article said. On and screen do not require union. (And buck [stark] naked is the colloquial expression.) See also 2 (end); GO OFF and GO ON; ONGOING; ONTO; Prepositions, 7; SPEAK TO, TALK TO; WAIT FOR and WAIT ON. ONE ANOTHER. See EACH OTHER. ONE as pronoun. 1. The indefinite ONE. 2. The I ONE. 3. Some other ONEs. 1. The indefinite ONE One serves as a pronoun, most often legitimately, sometimes less so. It is ac- ceptable to let one stand for a person in general or any of us or an average per- son: “One must earn a living.” / “One needs to watch one’s weight.” In this use, one as pronoun 273 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 273"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"which we may call the indefinite one, in- consistency is a problem that crops up fairly often. A sentence written for a newspaper by a dietitian will illustrate: . . . When one is occupied with good food, you don’t miss some of the foods you thought you would. The “one” that appears early in the sen- tence soon shifts to “you.” Inasmuch as “you” shows up three times, the simplest correction would be to change “one is” to you are or you’re. Anyway, keeping the first “one” would require “one” three more times (“one doesn’t miss” etc.) and the sentence would look stilted. A sentence from a magazine article also shifts from “one” to “you”: It [Vancouver] is compact and one has little need of a car if you are staying in one of the downtown hotels. It should all be either in the second per- son, “. . . and you have little need of a car if you are staying . . .”; or in the third person, “. . . and one has little need of a car if one is staying. . . .” If the latter is chosen, another improvement would be to change “one of the downtown hotels” to “ a downtown hotel. ” It is not just a matter of conciseness: When the indefi- nite one is used, it is best to avoid one in another sense. An excerpt from an op-ed article about telephone solicitors contains a glaring error and two subtle defects. Such calls were always intrusive, but when one receives one or two of them almost daily (or nightly), I really begin to think, “Their ought to be a law.” “Their,” of course, should be there. An- other mistake is the shift from third per- son to first person—“one . . . I.” A better way would be either “when I receive one or two . . . I really begin to think” (first person); or “when you receive one or two . . . you really begin to think” (sec- ond person). The indefinite one does not suit this sentence, which uses one in an- other sense (“when one receives one”). See 3 (end). See also Pronouns, 7. 2. The I ONE A less legitimate use of the pronoun is what we call here the I one but could as well call the coy one. Some people treat the word as a substitute for I, out of coy- ness, modesty, evasiveness, or affecta- tion. Its other forms are “one’s” in place of my and “oneself” in place of myself. A few quotations with translations: “His accounts . . . are the best one has seen”—the best I have seen. “. . . One’s efforts will now be more fully and adequately supported” —my efforts will. “. . . One was almost beside oneself with joy . . .” —I was almost beside myself with joy. This mannerism is associated mainly with British writing, although it is not rare among Americans. A “presidential spokesman” was quoted as saying: We have not solved problems re- lated to discrimination in the work- place and sometimes one wonders whether those who advocate abolish- ing affirmative action understand that clearly. Which “one” wonders? The forthright course would be to say “ I wonder . . . ” or “ the president wonders. ” But to be forthright is not the function of a presi- dential spokesman. 3. Some other ONEs The pronouns anyone, everyone, and someone need to be distinguished from the phrases any one, every one, and some one. The three pronouns refer only to people and mean any person, every per- 274 one as pronoun 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 274"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"son, and some person. (“ Anyone can en- ter the building.” / “I wish everyone a happy holiday.” / “ Someone is at the door.”) Each of the three phrases is made up of an adjective and the pronoun one, can refer to either things or people, and em- phasizes a single item or person. (“Any one of the jurors can thwart a convic- tion.” / “Every one of the envelopes con- tains a bill.” / “The check is in some one of the drawers.”) No one does not present such a prob- lem. It is always a two-word phrase. The common reflexive form of the in- definite one is oneself, with only one s and no apostrophe (“College study is a way to advance oneself”), although one’s self is its meaning and its variation. The pronoun one can represent a per- son or thing of a kind or group men- tioned or understood. “Sing one of the songs.” / “I’ve seen those machines and plan to buy one.” / “That one should fit you.” / “Give me the blue one.” / “Is this the one you want?” See also ANY, 2; EVERYBODY, EV- ERYONE; EVERY ONE and EVERY- ONE; Pronouns, 2C.

Similarly: “About one out of every six adults is a college graduate.” / “One in every forty children displays the symp- toms.” / “Only one in a thousand wins a prize.” See also MORE THAN ONE. 2. ONE OF THE, IF NOT THE, etc. The desire to avoid repetition is at the root of this problem, an example of which goes: “She was one of the best, if not the best, teacher I had.” It takes many forms, such as the form of this quotation, attributed to a medical inves- tigator: “It is one of the, if not the [,] most egregious case I’ve ever seen.” If the parenthetical phrase in each ex- ample is removed, neither sentence makes grammatical sense. The “one of the” part does not go with the singular noun: “one of the best . . . teacher” / “one of the . . . most egregious case.” Making the singular noun plural would add no sense; the pronoun and first verb, both singular, would not go with it: “She was . . . the best teachers.” / “It is . . . the most egregious cases.” This is a solution: Tell what group the individual or item is “one of,” before you consider that one as a lone superla- tive. And do not worry about a little rep- etition. “She was one of the best teachers, if not the best teacher, I had.” / “It is one of the most egregious cases, if not the most egregious case, I’ve ever seen.” Even limiting the parenthetical phrase to “if not the best” or “if not the most egregious” would be preferable to the original version: It is easier for some- one to mentally extract a part of a word that has been mentioned ( teacher from teachers, or case from cases ) than to imagine something that is not there. Another option is rewriting; for in- stance, “This case is as egregious as any I’ve seen in ten years, perhaps more so.” The rewritten version might be an im- provement. Those “if not” sentences can get repetitious themselves. 3. ONE OF THE . . .

What is the man one of? “. . . The five who get away.” What is the diary one of? “. . . The few Gilbert diaries that survive. . . . ” What is the pride one of? “. . . Six prides that live here.” An obituary opens with a singular noun that should be a plural noun: “Ju- dith Somogi, one of the first women to become a conductor, died . . . Wednes- day morning.” She was not the first woman to become a conductor but “one of the first women to become conduc- tors. ” Here is a similar error, the failure to use a plural pronoun and noun: their husbands. The erroneous sentence (from network TV news) can be interpreted whimsically. She [the princess] is one of the few Japanese women who will have her husband home for dinner at night.

Several dictionaries de- fine ongoing as an adjective that means progressing, evolving, or growing. More often it is used as a synonym for continu- ing, as in “the ongoing operation.” Ongoing or on-going came out of the nineteenth century. It appeals to those of our contemporaries with taste for bu- reaucratic jargon. Use it if you will (as an adjective before the noun), but not as a substitute for going on, in the Germanic manner in which it was used below (as a verb following an auxiliary verb). [A metropolitan mayor:] It [an inves- tigation] is ongoing as we speak. [A journalist in a TV forum:] There’s a Justice Department investigation ongoing. [A newspaper:] . . . He said negotia- tions with the developer were ongo- ing. [A news service:] . . .

In general Normally only affects the word or phrase that immediately follows. “Only time will tell.” / “The only thing we have to fear . . . .” (When exceptions will arise, “God only knows.”) The meaning of a sentence can hinge on the location of only. To illustrate, let us put it in different places in four other- wise identical sentences. A. Only he sells watches in town. (No- body else sells them here.) B. He only sells watches in town. (He does not make or fix them.) C. He sells only watches in town. (They are his sole merchandise here.) D.He sells watches only in town. (He sells them nowhere else.) Only is classified as ( 1 ) an adjective, meaning sole or single one in a category; ( 2 ) an adverb, meaning merely, solely, or exclusively; and ( 3 ) a conjunction, meaning but or except that. Some dis- parage that third function; 85 percent of The American Heritage Dictionary ’s us- age panel found this sentence unaccept- able in writing: “They would have come, only the automobile broke down.” 2. Misplacement A sign in a window of a clothing store announced: “Large Assortment of 100 % silk ties only 2 for 14 . 90 .” It seemed to be emphasizing that customers could have “only 2 ” ties (not three or four) at that price. Most people probably under- stood the offer, despite the misplacement of “only”; but “ 2 for only $ 14 . 90 ,” clearly emphasizing the price (with the $) would have presented it better. A developer planned to turn a historic farm into a village in Princeton Town- ship, New Jersey, a newspaper reported. However, Princeton zoning permit- ted only houses on three-acre sites on the White Farm.

In that case, only belonged else- where: “. . . permitted houses only on three-acre sites. . . .” The wording could be still clearer: “However, on the White Farm, Princeton zoning permitted houses only on sites of [at least?] three acres each.” The writer of an opinion piece told newspaper readers that he would have loved Ronald Reagan if the president only 277 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 277"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"had kept all of his campaign promises of 1980 .

ON and ONTO The relation between these two prepositions resembles that between in and into. On indicates position or location. Among its many senses, it means in con- tact with (a surface), e.g., a fly on a wall; or above and supported by (a surface), a dish on a table. Onto signifies motion to a position on (a surface). A frog hops from a tree onto the grass, then hops along on the grass. Sometimes on can fill the role of onto without confusion (Snow dropped on our heads); at other times, it cannot. If children throw a ball on the roof, they may be up there themselves; they are not if they throw the ball onto the roof. Onto is unequivocal. Among the early uses of onto was this by Keats, 1819 : “Please you walk forth Onto the terrace.” Since the sixteenth century, the preposition had been treated as two words, on to, a use that persisted in Britain into the modern era. 2. ON TO and ONTO When on, serving as an adverb, ad- joins the preposition to, the two words should not be joined. These are correct examples: “I walked on to the next vil- lage.” / “Take one copy and pass the rest on to your neighbor.” / “Hold on to the rope.” / “We’ll fight on to victory!” In each instance on is an adverb, closely re- lated to the verb. This is an erroneous use from a con- temporary book of essays: “I’d given this company, a bank, all my money to hold onto for me until I needed it.” Make it “hold on to for me . . .” or simply “hold for me . . .” To be on to something like a plot or scheme is an informal term meaning to be aware of it. The Oxford English Dic- tionary quotes an old editorial comment as an example of an erroneous joining of on and to: “It is a very pretty game, gov- ernor, but the people are onto it.” Two other dictionaries present that term as “onto” without identifying it as a mis- spelling.

Thackeray wrote in the 1850 s, “He opined that the rich should pay.” An ar- ticle in a daily paper praises a work of print and television even though it “pours fuel on the smoldering elec- tion-year rage of the middle class,” USA Today opined. A magazine article says of a performer’s supposed bodily insecurities: “I think . . . she looks in the mirror and sees a girl with big thighs,” opines [the] Striptease director ....

A columnist criticized passive verbs, remarking: If your doctor or lawyer write that way to other doctors or lawyers, fine. If a writer uses a singular subject with a plural verb in a column on word usage, it is not so fine. Change “write” to writes. Whenever the subject of a sentence or clause consists of two or more alterna- tives—that is, words or phrases linked by or or nor— and each alternative is sin- gular, the verb too must be singular. Example: “Either Mary or Jane has the key”—not “have.” It is held by one person, either this one or that one. The subject expresses oneness, and so must the verb express it. Any related pronoun also is singular: “Abe or Charles, whichever one goes, will have to pay his own way”—not “their.” Whenever or links plural alternatives in a subject, the verb is plural. It gets complicated when the alternatives differ in number. See EITHER, 1. Using or, like using nor, shows us some limitations of English. Which form of the verb goes in the following sen- tence? “Settle your quarrel before you or Joe get[s] hurt.” Both “you . . . gets” and “Joe get” are ungrammatical. A number of grammarians tolerate whichever verb goes with the nearer noun or pronoun, in that example “gets.” If the sentence is to be written, one can usually rephrase it, evading the dilemma; e.g., “Settle your quarrel before you get hurt or Joe does” / “. . . before someone gets hurt” / “. . . before you two get hurt.” Rephras- ing may be the best option. Instead of an alternative, or may in- troduce an appositive, an explanatory word or phrase. When it does, a comma precedes or: “The bird is a rock dove, or pigeon.” See also NOR; Series errors, 6.

It means the quantity of a product turned out in a given period of time, or the amount of energy or power that a device can produce, or the data that come out of a computer. The verb output flowered in the four- teenth to seventeenth centuries with sev- eral general meanings, and it persisted as output 279 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 279"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"jargon for produce or put out: “to out- put coal” or to “output some 1 , 200 tons of flour per day.” Computer technology assigned output another sense: to give out, print, or transfer processed data. No one objects to the technical use of a technical term. Adapting such a term to general use, however, may not be necessary. A common word or phrase may bring out the meaning as well or better. A boy doing poorly in school was de- scribed, in a newscast, as handicapped in “his ability to output the information” he was taught. To express it? To recall it? To write it down? Let that Germanic-sounding verb re- main a technical term in computing and industry, not replacing common words or phrases like put out. If we are lucky, nobody will ever “output” a fire, “out- put” a batter, “output” to sea, or “out- put” the cat. See also Backward writing, 3. OUTRAGEOUS, OUTRA- GEOUSLY. The adjective outrageous (and its adverbial relative outrageously ) can mean disgraceful(ly), harmful(ly), immoral(ly), indecent(ly), offensive(ly), shocking(ly), or violent(ly). Those mean- ings apply to criminal or other antisocial deeds. (“We’ve got to curb that drug lord’s outrageous activities.”) Does a sin- gle one apply to the event described be- low? More than 17 million visitors were attracted to the 1939 Golden Gate Exposition, held on man-made Trea- sure Island, dredged from the Bay bot- tom to house the outrageously spectacular exhibition. . . . Just why the writer thought he was im- proving on “spectacular” is murky. The producer of a computer show ad- vertised “OUTRAGEOUS DEALS UN- DER ONE ROOF!!” Was that a warning? OVAL. Oval (adjective and noun) originates in ovum, Latin for egg. En- glish adopted ovum in the sense of egg cell, female reproductive cell. From the foregoing, one could reasonably assume that oval has something to do with eggs, and so it has. Oval means (as an adjec- tive) egg-shaped, whether solidly or planely; or (as a noun) an egg shape. What is the shape of an egg? Anyone who has ever seen a common hen’s egg is probably aware that it is rounded and somewhat elongated, with one end broader than the other. The disparity be- tween egg ends is likely to be impressed on the minds of those who have read Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels and recall the violent ideological conflict in the empire of Liliput: It pitted the Big-Endians, the heretics, who broke their eggs at the big ends, against the Little-Endians, the or- thodox egg-breakers. Oval may be distinguished from ellip- tical (adjective) and ellipse (noun). An el- lipse is an elongated circle, the shape of the numeral 0 . (More technically, it is a symmetrical closed curve, the path of a point that moves in a way that the sum of its distances from two fixed points is constant.) A planet’s orbit is sometimes called its ellipse, inasmuch as the plane- tary orbits are approximately elliptical. An American football is an ellipsoid, a solid object whose plane sections are all ellipses or circles. The adjective is ellip- soid or ellipsoidal. More often than not, the public con- fuses an oval and an ellipse. Usually an ellipse is called (an) “oval.” Occasionally it is the other way around. A number of modern dictionaries have legitimated the misemployment, thereby contributing further to it. A national TV “magazine” broadcast a portrait of a tycoon in the chicken in- dustry. After visiting the White House, he redesigned his office to look like the president’s. But instead of “oval,” he calls it “egg-shaped.” 280 outrageous, outrageously 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 280"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"That is exactly what oval means. (Ex- actly what the shape of each office is, we do not know.) Scientists do not necessarily use the terms with any more precision than lay- men. The quotation is from a book on cosmology and pertains to a theory of cosmic history. Other regions, which did not happen to pick up a rotation, would become oval-shaped objects called elliptical galaxies. It contains a contradiction. If the galax- ies are elliptical, they are not “oval,” at least in strict usage—and if a scientist is not strict in his usage, who is? Anyway, “shaped” is redundant; it is part of the meaning of the adjective oval. OVER and MORE THAN. “Over 50 years in business,” says an ad for an auto painting company. Is the phrase “over 50 years” correct? People who work in the mass media frequently avoid over in that sense. An editor of mine insisted that over could only mean above in a literal, geometric sense: “I see the balloon over the build- ing.” (He expressed no such objection to under. ) Many an editor, despite a pen- chant for conciseness, will omit the word over in a sentence like “Over 2 , 000 at- tended” and change it to the two-word phrase more than. More than is perfectly proper, but it has been one of the mean- ings of over since the Middle Ages. The Oxford English Dictionary offers eight quotations, from the fourteenth century on, to illustrate that over can mean “In excess of, above, more than (a stated amount or number).” What caused the odd aversion to phrases like over a ton, over a million, and over 50 years after all those cen- turies of use? The only visible answer is a little book from 1909 called Write it Right by Ambrose Bierce. He subtitled it “A Little Blacklist of Literary Faults,” and one item was “ Over for More than. ” He gave an example, “A sum of over ten thousand dollars,” but no rea- son for his stricture. Bierce also damned such uses as “ Over for About, In, or Concerning ” (e.g., “Don’t cry over spilt milk” and “He rejoiced over his acquittal”) and “ Over for On ” (“The policeman struck him over the head”), uses that are gener- ally accepted. Although Bierce did not say anything about over in the sense of across (“Let’s walk over the bridge”), some others have condemned it. The Oxford, again, supports such use, offering quotations dating from the ninth century. For better or worse, over has numer- ous meanings and it has had them for centuries. The Random House Dictio- nary gives sixty-one definitions of the word, as preposition, adverb, adjective, noun, verb, and interjection (in radio communication, as in “Over and out”). OVERLY and OVER- words. 1. Is OVERLY unnecessary? 2. Misuse of OVERLY. 1. Is OVERLY unnecessary? Several grammarians have objected to any use of overly as superfluous, con- tending that the over- words have taken its place. They would, for instance, say overcautious and reject “overly cau- tious.” The Random House Dictionary lists about 1 , 500 over- words. The Oxford English Dictionary has 83 pages of over- words, many of which it prefers to hy- phenate, over-cautious, for instance. Such a word is a little more concise than an overly phrase and usually just as good. Overly is an “Americanism” to Britons, although the Oxford traces it back to A . D . 10 . (It was oferlice in Old English.) Before burying the word, let us consider two points: overly and over- words 281 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 281"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"• The language is full of synonyms. That the same idea may be expressed in two ways is not a strong reason to discard one of them. Overly means excessively (a word preferred in British English), yet the critics are not advocating the latter’s elimination. • On a few occasions overly can contribute to clarity or grace. It outdoes over- in this sentence: “The fight was over money and overbrutal.” Overly overt beats “overovert,” although too overt may be the best choice. And a behemoth like overgesticulative or overindividualistic may not suit a particular sentence, speaker, or writer. In a poem titled “The Second Voyage,” Kipling wrote: “Yet caring so, not overly we care / To brace and trim for every foolish blast.” Was he expected to force “overcare” into his iambic pentameter? 2. Misuse of OVERLY Overly is not misused often, but a columnist did wrongly insert it in an opening sentence: When an overly weight man came into my office wanting a notary I no- ticed his shoe was untied. The phrase “overly weight” is wrong. Change it to overweight or some other over- adjective. Alternatively, to keep “overly,” change “weight” to an adjec- tive referring to the man’s avoirdupois: overly heavy, overly stout. (The sentence also could use a comma after “notary.”) Overly is an adverb, a word that mod- ifies an adjective, a verb, or another ad- verb. It cannot modify a noun, such as “weight.” (The anecdote was leading to a histor- ical sketch: The portly one could not bend enough to tie his shoe; he would not have faced such a problem when the region was a ranch and men wore lace- less boots.) OWING TO. See DUE TO. OXYMORON. A panelist in a politi- cal discussion on television probably in- tended this question to be rhetorical: “If a ‘paid volunteer’ is not an oxymoron, what is?” The answer is that an oxymoron is a figure of speech in which contradictory words or ideas are intentionally com- bined. The striking effect produced by the juxtaposition of incompatibles is de- signed to make a point. Some popular examples are agreeing to disagree, deaf- ening silence, and killing with kindness. The oxymoron was a favored device in Latin and Greek literature. The word en- tered English from the Greek oxumoron, literally meaning pointed foolishness. If the contrariness of the terms is acci- dental or unintentional, other words can describe it. If a bureaucrat comes up with a phrase like “paid volunteer”; a novelist writes that “they had found in- creasingly little to talk about”; or a diplomat remarks, “The situation in Iraq is clearly very confused,” there may be a contradiction, an incompatibility, or a paradox. The word oxymoron should be reserved for the figure of speech. 282 owing to 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 282"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"PACHYDERM. See Synonymic silli- ness, 1. PADDY. Paddy is rice. It comes from the Malay padi, meaning rice in the husk, and in the strictest sense paddy de- notes such rice, whether it is growing or has been harvested. By extension, the word can also mean rice in general. Used loosely, it means rice field. Describing an Egyptian oasis, a book explains that the growing of rice there is forbidden for fear of malaria, because “mosquitoes thrive in paddy fields.” Paddy is used admirably. On the con- trary, these press samples show no un- derstanding of it: Across the rice paddies, several hundred men from leftist organiza- tions carried red banners. . . . The dilapidated brick villages and bright green rice paddies in this cor- ner of southern China sometimes seem as American as chop suey. Many Cambodian houses are built on stilts near the rice paddies that line the road. “Rice paddies” is redundant. Change all the “paddies” to fields, or at least omit “rice.” Rice is totally absent in a piece about Maui, Hawaii, by a travel editor: “White-haired old men and women re- turn from their taro paddies, their legs spackled with mud.” The people work in taro fields. Taro is an edible plant that has nothing to do with paddy. (More- over speckled is misspelled and “old” is superfluous editorializing.) PAIR. Pair (noun), like couple, con- cerns two of the same kind. Pair, how- ever, often stresses their close association, perhaps their mutual depen- dence: a pair of pants, a pair of scissors. Pair, like other collective nouns, may be either singular or plural. It depends on which gets the emphasis: the group as a unit or its individual members. If you say, “A blue pair of pants does not go with a brown pair of shoes,” you are emphasizing the oneness of each pair. But “A pair of soldiers were guard- ing the entrance to their post.” To say “was guarding . . . its” post would be ridiculous. When pair refers to people, it is normally plural. A nature film depicted two dangerous animals of Africa, the cape buffalo and the hippopotamus. The narrator said, “When the pair clashes, the outcome is uncertain.” The two clash. They could not do so if they were one. Besides, pair has special meaning when applied to an- imals: it denotes two that are either mated or yoked for labor. pair 283 P 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 283"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"A news story said: “In a rare finding, a pair of twins has been shown to have dif- ferent fathers.” Make it either “ have been shown to have different fathers” or “has been shown to have two fathers.” That which is one unit cannot differ from itself.

One physician spoke about another on a tele- vision “magazine” program and made what may have been a slip of the tongue: “The doctor palpitated a mass, but noth- ing was done to rule it out.” The “it” that the speaker referred to was cancer, but he should have ruled the “-it-” out of “palpitated.” The word he needed was palpate, to touch a part of someone’s body for medical diagnosis. To palpitate, said of the heart, is to beat unusually fast or intensely or with abnormal flutter. The two words have a relationship. They come from different forms of the Latin verb palpare, to touch. PANTS. See PAIR; Plurals and singu- lars, 1; Verbal unmentionables. PARADISE. See Hawaii. Paragraph. Almost every piece of writing is divided into paragraphs. They are orderly collections of sentences. The main function of a paragraph is to group related points, ideas, or statements. A new paragraph says in effect, “Here comes something a bit different.” The eye recognizes it because each paragraph starts on a new line and is commonly in- dented (begun a little distance in from the margin), except that publishers often do not indent the first paragraph of a book chapter, magazine article, etc. A paragraph may have one sentence, if its message stands alone; or multiple sentences, if they all go together in se- quence. But it should not have too many. A secondary purpose of a paragraph is to give the reader a momentary rest, a chance to absorb a particular point be- fore moving on to the next point. Some- times a paragraph, though properly homogeneous, is too long. It may then need to be divided more or less arbitrar- ily, for the brain can weary of overlong blocks of writing. An extreme example is seen in Webster’s Third Dictionary, where paragraphs reach lengths of some four thousand words ( take and turn ). Newspapers often go to the opposite extreme. Journalists know that the usual newspaper column, being narrow, does not lend itself to long paragraphs. Many turn nearly every sentence into its own paragraph, thinking that they are fur- thering readability. They are hindering it, failing to fully organize the material, and defeating the main function of a para- graph. PARAMETER and PERIMETER. See Confusing pairs. PARANOIA, PARANOID. Pa ra - noia (noun) is a psychosis characterized by a delusion of persecution or grandeur or both. Usually the delusion centers on one theme that is elaborated with logic, and the person is otherwise rational and intelligent. Paranoid (adjective) means character- istic of, relating to, or exhibiting the psy- chosis. Often “paranoid” and sometimes “paranoia” are used loosely to refer to a feeling or showing of worry, fear, dis- trust, or suspicion. Who among us has never had real cause for such thoughts? A book says to “trust your agent— don’t get paranoid if you don’t receive an instant response.” Was distrustful or fearful meant?

A woman had been convicted of murder- ing a well-known singer. Jurors now were deliberating on the penalty. “They could decide on a penalty ranging from parole to life in prison,” a radio news re- port said. “Parole” was wrong. Proba- tion would have been right (from the standpoint of English usage). The penalty, by the way, turned out to be life in prison. Parole is the conditional release of an imprisoned convict. One who is on pa- role must exhibit good behavior and fol- low certain rules during the period of parole. Probation is the conditional freedom that sometimes is allowed a convicted person instead of imprisonment. The sentence of someone on probation is sus- pended as long as he behaves well and fulfills any conditions that the court sets. A parolee or probationer is under the supervision of his parole officer or pro- bation officer and may be imprisoned for violation of his conditions for freedom. Laws governing parole differ from state to state. A term of parole may be fixed and follow each completed prison term; or it may be determined by a pa- role board, vary with each convict, and reduce prison time. Participle. A participle is a word that is derived from a verb, has the properties of both verb and adjective, and can go with an auxiliary— has, had, is, was, or the like—to indicate tense. Two types are past participle, such as fallen and thrown; and present partici- ple, such as falling and throwing. Some examples of use: “The city has fallen to the rebels.” / “He was hit by a thrown ball.” / “I see a falling star.” / “They’re throwing darts.” General dictionaries customarily list a verb’s infinitive, past tense, past partici- ple, and present participle, in that order, e.g.: ring, rang, rung, ringing. If the past tense and past participle are the same, they parsimoniously allot one word be- tween them: make, made, making. Occasionally participles are ambigu- ous. An article about gambling on In- dian reservations was headed “Cheating Indians.” Did the present participle de- scribe Indians who were cheating or mean that some people were cheating In- dians? (Probably the latter.) Combining have with a past participle sometimes creates an ambiguity. A news report dealt with “mothers who have abused children.” Did it mean simply that the mothers were parents of abused children or was it alleging that the moth- ers themselves have abused children? See HAVE, HAS, HAD. The combination of having and a past participle forms a perfect participle. “ Having done the work, I went home.” Among entries that consider partici- ples are BEGIN, BEGAN, BEGUN; COME and CAME; DO, DID, DONE; Gerund, 1; GONE and WENT; Infini- tive, 3; LAY and LIE; Modifiers, 1A (dangling participles); SLAY, SLAIN, SLEW; TEAR, TORE, TORN; Tense, 5; THINK, past participle; Verbs, 1B.

Pa y has nautical senses (transitive): to let out (a line) and to coat with a water- proof material. The past tense in those senses is payed. PEACOCK. “Why do peacocks— male peacocks—have such beautiful tails?” A radio host asked listeners that question, as part of a short discussion of natural selection. “Male peacocks” is a redundant phrase. The peacock is male. It is a male peafowl (plural peafowl or peafowls ), a type of pheasant of either of two species, native to southern Asia but widely domesticated. The female is a peahen, which lacks the peacock ’s spec- tacular tail. A vain person may be called a pea- cock, and sometimes the word is used as a verb (intransitive): to peacock is to dis- play oneself vainly. PEDAL and PEDDLE. See Homo- phones. PENCHANT and PENSION. A book describes a Briton’s sculptures of the royal family: Art lovers admired his rendering of the queen’s expression but found the figures to be dressed like tramps, for “his pension did not run to the sort of garb in which Royalty is nor- mally kitted out.” Instead of “pension,” the word should be penchant, a persis- tent liking or a strong inclination. Pen- sion is a retirement benefit or a European boarding house. (We should not be too critical of the book, inasmuch as it is The Incomplete Book of Failures: The Official Handbook of the Not- Terribly-Good Club of Great Britain. ) PEOPLE and PERSONS. An article on labor problems in London said, “More than 150 people were injured, mostly police officers, and 67 persons were arrested.” Why were the injured called “people” and the arrested called “persons”? Either one would have been acceptable, but using both raises that question. When in doubt, you will probably not go wrong using people as the plural of person. Persons, especially popular with lawyers and journalists, can seem stilted at times, although it has a proper use. Persons emphasizes individuals. It ap- plies to a specific but not large number: “The group honored seven persons.” People can be used in that way too; but, of those two words, only people is cor- rect in referring to human beings in gen- eral, or in a large group, or indefinitely. No one should remark that “persons are funny,” speak for “the American per- sons,” or sing about “persons who like persons.” PEOPLE as a suffix. People is a word, a noun. It is not a suffix, though it has been rudely forced into that role of late. Some of the outlandish creations are less informative than the legitimate words they replace. Two reviews on one tabloid page re- ferred to “waitpeople” at restaurants, not saying whether they were waiters or waitresses or both. A national-parks functionary seeking funds was quoted as saying, “I hope people will write their congresspeople.” There are no such officials.

PERPETRATE. “He joined with Chief Justice Warren and perpetrated a revolution in the fifties and the sixties.” The intention of a TV moderator was probably to honor Justice Brennan, not to condemn him. Yet one could draw the opposite conclusion from “perpetrated.” To perpetrate (verb, transitive) some- thing is to commit or carry it out; usually it is a felony or immoral deed, but it can be a repugnant action that is not felo- nious or immoral, say a blunder or hoax. Although a descendant of the Latin per- petrare, to accomplish, perpetrate is not a neutral word and no vehicle for praise. PERQUISITE and PREREQUI- SITE. A perquisite (noun) is a benefit that goes with a job in addition to money, or a privilege expected by virtue of one’s office. “Use of a mansion is a perquisite of the governorship.” A collo- quial short form is perk or perq. A prerequisite (noun) is a prior condi- tion that must be fulfilled before some- thing that one desires is available. “A high school diploma is a prerequisite of college admission.” Prerequisite (adjec- tive) means required in advance. “Latin 1 is prerequisite to Latin 2 .” Note that of follows the noun and to the adjective.

Few words so innocuous have figured in as much linguistic pollution as person. The harm is done when the word is tacked to some other word, usually out of ignorance. Misunderstanding of the origin and meaning of -man has led to various circumlocutions, of which -person is one. See -MAN-, MAN. So far, it appears, nobody has sought to re- place the -son in person. A columnist criticized a candidate for “congressperson from the Fifth Dis- trict,” and a big ad protesting against a foreign leader said to write “Your Con- gressperson.” There is no such official.

Presumably males did not qual- ify as “-persons.” A column referred to the “hostessper- son” at a restaurant, in case anyone might think the hostess was not a per- son.

Meanings Person now is a bland synonym for human being, but its ancestral meaning had little humanity in it. It comes, via Old French, from the Latin persona, lit- erally a mask used in Roman drama, also a character or role. The sense of a mask did not make it into English, but that of character or role did. The import of person has varied from one of distinction to one of inferi- ority. Person was used contemptuously for some time. It stood for a lower-class man (“a person in the trade”) and for a young woman. It has also denoted a liv- ing body or bodily form, appearance, or presence. Person has had special meanings in re- ligion, where it is one of the three mani- festations of the Trinity; in philosophy, a rational being or human personality; in law, an individual or an organization; and in grammar, a classification of pro- nouns and corresponding verb forms. See ONE as pronoun, 1; Pronouns, 7. In person, meaning physically pre- sent, can be a useful phrase. In “The ac- tor will appear in person,” it emphasizes that the appearance will be bodily, not pictorial. But it is probably unnecessary in “The president cannot attend in per- son.” Attendance is in person. See also PEOPLE and PERSONS; PERSONAL. PERSONAL. Personal (adjective) means of or pertaining to a certain per- son; private; intimate; bodily; or like a person. A book on English usage reproves the use of personal to qualify words that can be nothing else: mainly charm, friend, and opinion. Yet elsewhere it says, “The comments in this article reflect a per- sonal opinion. . . .” One can assume that the writer’s opinion is personal. A “personal opinion” may occasion- ally be valid in distinguishing it from an official opinion. So may “Personally, my view is. . . .” However, the adverb is su- perfluous in “I cannot attend person- ally.” See also PERSON, 2.

Strictly speaking, personality is an abstract noun that usu- ally pertains to a person’s pattern of traits or to one’s character: “a dual per- sonality” / “her pleasant personality.” To say “She has personality” without de- scribing it is a colloquial use, not very in- formative except to imply that the speaker likes her personality. Everyone has it. In a news story, the word served as a nondescript tag for a television per- former: . . . The evening’s host, “Entertain- ment Tonight” personality Mary Hart, presented 14 distinguished ser- vice awards for Holocaust remem- brance in the performing arts. . . . Using personality as a job title is quite in- formal and not suitable for a straight news account of a rather somber ban- quet. If the writer did not know the woman’s function on the show (co-host), he could have written “Mary Hart of ‘Entertainment Tonight.’ ” (It would have improved the awkward form too.

They do not answer, but he does carry on a two-way conversation with Sleep; Dawn instructs her children, the Hours; Indignation answers Pity; and a crowd vows allegiance to Anarchy as it rides by, crowned and sceptered. To regard nonhuman things as people is a time-honored poetic device. Their in- vestment with human attributes but not full human status is a closely related de- vice and equally reputable, though dis- paraged by John Ruskin as the “pathetic fallacy.” A prose example is the caption of a cartoon by James Thurber: “It’s a naive domestic Burgundy without any breeding, but I think you’ll be amused by its presumption.” Those devices are less honored in mat- ter-of-fact writing or speaking. A news photo showed private vehicles using a lane meant for buses; meanwhile, a cap- tion said, “One bus chose to use an adja- cent lane.” The power of choice belonged to the driver, not to the bus. News stories telling of the suffering of vehicles or buildings in mishaps are dis- putable too. See SUFFER; SUSTAIN. A woman tells what cars think, in LIKE (last quotation). Sympathetic rivers are headlined in MERCY and PITY. To apply the pronoun she or her to a country or ship is a traditional personifi- cation. It or its is an acceptable alterna- tive. What is unacceptable is mixing those treatments: “Japan . . . accepts re- sponsibilities . . . which it cannot aban- don; her frontier is no longer the sea.” Change either “it” to she or “her” to its.

The word may also, as a noun, denote a department or office concerned with employees (“Mr. Carey is the head of personnel”) or, as an adjective, refer to employees or the managing of employees (“Please get me these personnel files”). 2.

The first is pronounced PER-son-null, the second per-son-NELL; and note the second n and second e in personnel. Sometimes the two words are indeed confused, even by those who should know better, and the fact that both come from the Late Latin person- alis, meaning personal, is no excuse.

A student on a hir- ing committee said to her, “Tell me about your personal experiences.” She assumed that he was inquiring about her experiences in the personnel field, not her religious or sexual experiences, “oth- erwise I could have sued them for ha- rassment.” PERSONS and PEOPLE.

A phenomenon is ( 1 ) an ob- servable occurrence or circumstance, ( 2 ) a scientifically notable natural event, or ( 3 ) an extraordinary, prodigious, or mar- velous thing or occurrence. Phenomenon is singular. Of Greek origin, it has a Greek plural, phenomena. “Earthquakes and tsunamis are related phenomena.” Two talk show hosts on a radio sta- tion used the wrong form: “I don’t know if this [fading interest in disasters] is uniquely American or if this is an inter- national phenomena. . . .” / “The Ameri- can Revolution was in large part a minority phenomena.” On television, a gerontologist, a journalist, and a news- caster respectively did likewise: “It’s the most complex biological phenomena that we know.” / “We had this strange phenomena of the president speaking but his mike turned off.” / “Geologists say that what they see is a new phenom- ena.” Every “phenomena” should have been phenomenon. Phenomenons is an alternative plural of phenomenon in the third sense (ex- traordinary thing etc.). The adjective phenomenal commonly applies to phe- nomenon in that sense.

These mics will not pickup as much noise and radio frequency interference (RFI) as high impedance microphones will. . . . Microphones pickup everything, to greater and lesser degrees, within their directivity patterns. Change each “pickup” to pick up. In the context of recording or broad- casting, to pick up is to take sound or light into the system, for conversion into electrical energy. Pickup is the process or the apparatus. The primary meaning of pick up is lift up. It has several other meanings, among them to accelerate, to acquire or learn casually, to improve, and to stop for and take along. Pickup has about as many meanings: acceleration, the act of picking up pas- sengers or objects, a phonograph arm, a pickup truck, and special senses in the jargons of agriculture, broadcasting, journalism, and music. In slang, it is a stranger met casually with the aim of lovemaking. (Two minor points: The logic of shortening microphone before spelling it in full is obscure. And the pet name is better spelled mike, if it is to rhyme with like and not tic. ) 2. Unneeded hyphen and preposition Sometimes a hyphen is placed be- tween pick and up. For the noun, it is unnecessary, though not objectionable: “This car has good pick-up.” For the verb, it is erroneous. A sign in a national park tells people to “pick-up” their dogs’ dirt. They should pick up the stuff. See also Punctuation, 4C (near end). An article in a Mississippi newspaper said about high school dress codes: “Some schools are already picking up on new fashion trends.” Picking up is enough.

PLAY DOWN and “DOWN- PLAY.” To play down something is to make little of it or to minimize its impor- tance. “The press played down the event.” A Germanic-sounding inversion of it is “downplay,” which probably origi- nated in telegraphic messages between correspondents and editors. By reversing and combining two words, a journalist saved the cost of a word. Such jargon was not intended for use in any newspa- per story: “Hospital officials down- played the investigation.” / “The counties also allege the industry fraudu- lently misled the public . . . by down- playing the potential health risks.” Nor was it meant for a broadcast in- terview: “The Administration had downplayed any real prospects” (of Rus- sia’s agreeing to an expansion of NATO). Or a forum: “I don’t want to downplay what they’re doing” (referring to academics’ criticism of the news me- dia). Or an almanac: “Over time . . . fas- cist elements were downplayed” (in the Franco regime). John Chancellor, the late broadcaster, and Walter R. Mears, journalist, wrote that “the news business has coined its share of dreadful nonwords. Take ‘downplay.’ . . . It does not save words, and it ought to be banned.” We need not go so far as to criminalize nonwords, but play down and “downplay” 291 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 291"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"a case can be made for putting that one on the most-unwanted list for speakers of English.

Principles and problems. 1. Errors A circus menagerie included lions, tigers, and “rhinoceri,” a radio reporter said. And at a zoo “the approach of the rhinoceri did give us a start,” a TV host said. Perhaps they deemed an “i” ending for rhinoceros an elegant Latinism. They were wrong. The plural is rhinoceroses or just rhinoceros. The word came from rhinokeros, Greek for nose-horn. Some swear that the plural of octopus is octopi, in Latin fashion. But not all Latin -us singulars change to -i plurals, and anyway the word came originally from Greek, in which oktopous meant eight-footed. One is on firmer ground using octopuses or, to be fancier, oc- topodes (pronounced oc-TOP-a-deez ), even though dictionaries condone the misconception. A common mistake is to use an exotic plural as a singular: e.g., “a criteria” / “a memoranda” / “a stimuli.” Another mis- take is to add s to one of them, produc- ing a double plural: “criterias” / “memorandas” / “stimulis.” In a re- gional idiosyncracy, s or es is added to common plurals: “folkses” / “lices” / “oxens” / “sheeps” / “geeses.” In dealing with plurals and singulars, affixing the wrong ending is one pitfall; another is omitting the right ending. When “The Ultimate Pant” flashed on television screens, it was not referring to someone’s last gasp. It purported to ad- vertise a particular brand and style of pants. The word has no singular when applied to an article of clothing. People have been known to omit the plural endings of calves, corps, hooves, measles, and summons, thinking that “calv” / “corp” / “hoov” / “measle” / “summon” are singular. Appendix (a singular whose plural is appendices or appendixes ) has been turned into “ap- pendic.” Other nonstandard colloquialisms are singulars used as plurals (“many bushel” / “foot” / “mile” / “pair” / “year”) and plurals used as singulars (“a woods” / “grounds” / “stairs” / “ways”). 2. Principles and problems A. Basic The principle is simple for most nouns: To turn a singular into a plural, add s or es. Add the es if the word nor- mally ends in a sibilant (a ch, j, s, sh, x, z, or zh sound). The s is voiceless after a voiceless sound ( cats ) but pronounced z after a voiced sound ( dogs ). The es is pro- nounced iz (as in foxes ). Problems lie in the minority that are irregular nouns. B. Compounds What to do about hyphenated words, like mother-in-law, or sets of words, like consul general, is a common puzzle. The traditional principle, increasingly disre- garded, is to assign the plural ending to the part that is normally a noun; or, if there are two nouns, to the more impor- tant one. Thus these are plurals: adjutants gen- eral, aides-de-camp, attorneys general, daughters-in-law, men-of-war, mothers- 292 play up 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 292"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"in-law, consuls general, courts martial, notaries public, sergeants major, and tugs of war. The noun goes first in each of those; it goes second in these: judge advocates, lieutenant generals, major generals. Many compounds that do not end in nouns get simple s endings, partic- ularly if they are single words: break- throughs, forget-me-nots, knockouts, ne’er-do-wells, takeoffs, and words end- ing in -ful, like cupfuls and spoonfuls. C. Creatures; peculiarities English has a variety of peculiar changes to perplex newcomers. Louse and mouse change to lice and mice. Blouse and house become blouses and houses, but the s sound in house changes to a z sound in the plural. You have one goose or two geese, but mongoose be- comes mongooses, and moose remains moose. Fish remains fish for individual speci- mens but becomes fishes for different types. Many fishes and beasts have sim- ple s plurals, but sometimes the singular is treated as a plural, particularly by fish- ermen and hunters: two flounders or flounder; three pheasants or pheasant. Other creatures are unchanged in the plural, except for different types or vari- eties. John buys two salmon or studies the different salmons of North America. I saw two deer and wondered which deers inhabit this region. Coffee, fruit, silk, steel, tea, wheat, and wool are treated as singular except when different types or varieties are considered; then s is affixed and it becomes plural. An or- chard produces lots of fruit and five dif- ferent fruits. D. -EN, -REN The -en and -ren forms are descended from Old English. They turn brother, child, ox, man, and woman into brethren (the archaic version of broth- ers), children, oxen, men, and women. E. Foreign derivations Some words preserve the forms of the foreign languages they were derived from. As in Latin, the singular words ad- dendum, alumnus, datum, genus, minu- tia, ovum, stimulus, and stratum change to the plural addenda, alumni, data, gen- era, minutiae, ova, stimuli, and strata. As in Greek, analysis, criterion, ellipsis, phe- nomenon, and thesis change to analyses, criteria, ellipses, phenomena, and theses. Other words adopted from foreign languages present a choice between the original plural and an Anglicized plural. Beau may become either beaux (French) or beaus. Cactus: either cacti (Latin) or cactuses. Carcinoma: either carcinomata (Greek) or carcinomas. Cherub: either cherubim (Hebrew) or cherubs. Curricu- lum: either curricula (Latin) or curricu- lums. Formula: either formulae (Latin) or formulas. Index: either indices (Latin) or indexes. Libretto: either libretti (Ital- ian) or librettos. Matrix: either matrices (Latin) or matrixes. Nucleus: either nu- clei (Latin) or, occasionally, nucleuses. Opus: either opera (a possibly confusing Latinism) or opuses. Radius: either radii (Latin) or radiuses. Virtuoso: either vir- tuosi (Italian) or virtuosos. F. -F ending Words that end in the f sound in the singular may have a -ves ending in the plural. Calf, half, knife, leaf, life, thief, self, wife, and wolf become calves, halves, knives, leaves, lives, thieves, selves, wives, and wolves. But wharf may become either wharfs or wharves and hoof either hoofs or hooves. Roof be- comes only roofs. And still life becomes only still lifes. G. -ICS ending Words that end in -ics may be con- strued either as singular or as plural. It depends on meaning. Considered as sciences, subjects, or occupations, acoustics, acrobatics, ath- letics, ethics, mathematics, physics, poli- tics, statistics, tactics, and so on are usually treated as singulars. Considered plurals and singulars 293 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 293"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"as qualities or activities, they are usually treated as plurals.

Miss becomes Misses or misses (with no name). Ms. has no plural. ( See Titles, 2. ) I. No plurals Most words that represent abstrac- tions, generalizations, or qualities, rather than concrete items, are singular only. Examples are amazement, courage, eat- ing, fondness, happiness, ignorance, learning, nonsense, and vindication. J. -O ending Add s to any word ending in o after a vowel: patios, radios, stereos, studios and tattoos. Most words ending in o after a conso- nant also take s ( altos, egos, pianos ), but several take -es ( echoes, heroes, pota- toes, tomatoes ). Several others go either way: buffaloes or buffalos, cargoes or cargos, dominoes or dominos, zeroes or zeros. K. -S ending Some nouns that normally end in s may be considered either plural or singu- lar: alms, barracks, corps, forceps, means, scissors (also pair or pairs of scis- sors ). Some other nouns that end in s are plural in form though singular in mean- ing: blues (music), checkers, overalls, measles, pants, remains, tongs, trousers. Chess, kudos, and news are singular only. The plural of lens is lenses. The plural of gallows is either the same or, occasionally, gallowses. Names ending in s add es: Barnes— the Barneses. Davis— the Davises. Jones— the Joneses. L.

See also Number (grammatical) with a list of references. PLUS. Plus is not always a synonym for and. The sentence “Talent plus luck accounts for his success” correctly has a singular verb. But “Talent and luck ac- count for his success” correctly has a plural verb. Plus, meaning added to or increased by, is a preposition, like with. It is not a conjunction, a connecting word, like and. “Four plus three equals seven” is right. Each number is construed as sin- gular, so the total is singular. In that con- text and is synonymous with plus. “Four and three equals seven” is idiomatic. “The potato plus the apple costs fifty cents,” but “The potatoes plus the apple cost a dollar.” In the latter sentence, the verb, cost, is plural because potatoes is plural, not because of the plus. That brings us to an item about a fa- ther’s concern that his son is close to driving age. The Vice President’s Observatory Hill mansion grounds have private roads on which the teen-ager can learn to drive. “Plus you have a police car in front,” Quayle said, “and a concrete 294 plus 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 294"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"wall around the place and an ambu- lance following behind. . . .” Usually “plus” does not start a sentence or clause, except in the most casual speech.

The phrase is not impartial. It suggests that what is pointed out is true. Unless the information is clearly fac- tual (“He pointed out a defective leg of that chair”) or you are prepared to vouch for its truth (“Let me point out my client’s long record of altruism”), use a more neutral word or phrase. A TV newscaster’s announcement that a utility company “points out that Proposition 9 is not needed” in effect supported the company’s position. Re- placing “points out” with says or con- tends would have maintained the impartiality of the television station. POOL. See BILLIARDS and POOL. POPULIST.

The Populist party nominated James Weaver of Iowa for president in 1892 .... Four years later the Populist party fused with the Democratic party.... The party was the People’s Party. A sup- porter of that party, but not the party it- self, was called Populist. Weaver, for instance, was a Populist. The farmer’s movement of that era was known as the Populist movement or Populism.

Possessive pronouns. 5. Various questions. 1. Can a thing possess something? A grammatical tradition has it that the possessive ending in ’s applies only to animate beings. An extreme view re- serves the ’s possessive to human beings, with few exceptions. Thus a grammarian holding that view rejects “Florida’s gov- ernor.” It would have to be the governor of Florida. Presumably the governor’s signature would be acceptable. But the exceptions that have become standard are many and getting more nu- merous. They are in innumerable com- mon expressions: a day’s work; for heaven’s sake; in harm’s way; my mind’s eye; my wit’s end; a stone’s throw; to- day’s paper. Literary uses abound: A Midsummer Night’s Dream / “the dawn’s early light . . . the twilight’s last gleaming” / “the pangs of despised love, the law’s delay” / “the wheel’s kick and the wind’s song” / “The world’s great age begins anew.” The extreme view is not recom- mended here. Nevertheless, the use of ar- possessive problems 295 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 295"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"tificial possessives in the news business has long been rampant. Some, like the nation’s capital in place of the national capital, have become familiar. Others are unidiomatic combinations such as “Spain’s King Juan Carlos” instead of King Juan Carlos of Spain, designed to save minute amounts of space. One typi- cal paragraph in a news magazine con- tains phrases like “the group’s new leader . . . the group’s founder . . . Jihad’s representative in Tehran warning that Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Intelligence believes. . . .” Let inanimate objects or animals pos- sess things, if they can do so gracefully. Few will complain about “The town’s only theater” / “The value of Apple’s stocks” / “a dog’s age” / “horses’ hoofs.” But let no one speak of “the century’s turn,” write that “I’m having my life’s time,” or wish anyone the “morning’s top.” 2. Multiple possessives “Your and my boss are friends” and “My and her children play together” sound strange, because in each instance the first possessive pronoun is separated from the noun. Placing one possessive pronoun before the noun and the other after the noun solves the problem: “Your boss and mine . . .” / “My children and hers. . . .” If we have something in com- mon, there is no problem: “our build- ing” / “our country.” How to make two nouns possessive depends on whether possession is sepa- rate (“The plaintiff ’s and the defendant ’s attorneys”) or joint (“Laurel and Hardy ’s films”). See Punctuation, 1E. 3. Possessive or not? Whether a noun is possessive or merely acting as a modifier can be a sub- tle distinction. One can write about the United States’ population and a new United States citizen or about General Motors’ plants and the General Motors Building. Note that it is never “United State’s” or “General Motor’s.” The names of organizations are highly variable in their use or nonuse of the apostrophe. It is the Boys’ Clubs of America but the Girls Clubs of America; the International Backpackers’ Associa- tion but the National Campers and Hik- ers Association; the Sheet Metal Workers’ International Association but the Transport Workers Union of Amer- ica; the National Sheriff’s Association but the Music Teachers National Associ- ation. The apostrophe is necessary in Chil- dren’s Aid Society and Women’s Chris- tian Temperance Union. Without an apostrophe, it makes no sense to add an s to children or women. The same is true for any other word that is plural without an added s. The apostrophe is traditional in phrases like ten years’ imprisonment and thirty days’ notice. Some critics would omit the apostrophe in such phrases. No one would want possession in such vari- ations as a thirty-day notice or notice of thirty days. It would be a thousand dol- lars’ worth or, in figures, $1,000 worth. 4. Possessive pronouns Let nobody tamper with a word like hers, his, our, ours, your, or yours. It takes no ’s, no apostrophe. It is already possessive. Sometimes “her’s” and “our’s” and “your’s” are seen, and they are wrong (although they were deemed correct centuries back). So is “his’n” or “hisn,” a dialectal version of his, which is heard or seen in some regions. A word like his, hers, etc. may be re- garded as a personal pronoun in the pos- sessive case. There are two types: • The type that goes before the noun (e.g., “This is her house”). It takes in the singular words my, your, his, her, and its and the plural words our, your, and their. 296 possessive problems 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 296"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"• The type that goes after the noun (“This house is hers ”): the singulars mine, yours, his, hers, and its and the plurals ours, yours, and theirs. (Words of the first type are known also as possessive adjectives. Some gram- marians assign that name to my, your his, her, etc. because they go before nouns, as adjectives do: “This is a fra- grant flower.” But adjectives too follow nouns: “This flower is fragrant. ”) The indefinite pronoun is a class of pronoun that can be made possessive, e.g., anybody’s, anyone’s, either’s, every- body’s, everyone’s, nobody’s, one’s, somebody’s, and someone’s. 5. Various questions Is this correct? “I have Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, the soprano’s, records.” What is made possessive when an appos- itive, or an explanatory word or phrase, follows a person’s name? The appositive is. That example is correct, and so is this one: “They showed Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.’s, first film.” But “records of Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, the soprano” and “the first film by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.” are smoother ways to express the same thoughts. How is a compound noun like broth- ers-in-law and attorneys general made possessive when it already has a plural s? Add an apostrophe and another s. “Guess what my brothers-in-law’s occu- pations are.” / “He spoke at the attor- neys general’s meeting.” Which is right, “They ask for our first name” or “names”? The latter; we have separate names. But “John and Agnes are selling their house, ” if they own it jointly. See Nouns, 3. Is it “the painting of my daughter” or “the painting of my daughter’s”? It is the first if the picture shows her; the second if it was painted by her. Some critics find the double negative illogical, however old and established. Nobody objects to it when the possessive is a pronoun: “a col- league of mine.” See Double possessive. What is the genitive case? It is the pos- sessive case, the form of a noun or pro- noun that indicates someone’s or something’s possession, characteristic, product, etc. See also Pronouns, 10A.

This sentence was part of a statement to the voters of a city from its legislative body: Every time San Franciscans face the possibility to enact candidate spend- ing reform, hired gun campaign con- sultants and weak-willed candidates try to snow the voters. “The possibility to enact” is not id- iomatic. Make it “the possibility of en- act ing. . . . ” (And insert a hyphen after “candidate.”) See Gerund, 3. POUR and PORE. See Homo- phones. PRACTICABLE and PRACTI- CAL. See Confusing pairs. PRECEDE and PROCEED. See Confusing pairs. PREDECESSOR and SUCCES- SOR. A magazine publisher, leaving to take another job, wrote to his readers, “I . . . know you will be as kind and thoughtful to my predecessor as you were to me.” Someone’s predecessor is one who preceded him, one who served earlier in the same capacity. The oppo- site word was needed: successor, one who succeeds another. “My successor” is the person who will take my job when I leave. Predicate.

The ABC’s of prepositions The preposition is a deceptive part of speech, simple on the surface while trou- bling to learners of English and some- times to native speakers as well. It is everywhere; it appeared in the last sen- tence five times. It includes some of the shortest words —at, by, in, of, on, to, up— but properly choosing and using it can be illogical, dictated by idiom. A preposition shows the relation of a word or phrase in a sentence to a noun 298 pour and pore 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 298"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"or pronoun in that sentence. In the sen- tence “She lives in Providence,” the preposition in relates the verb lives to the noun Providence. In “The cat came to me,” the preposition to relates the verb came to the pronoun me. A preposition may relate an adjective to a noun (“young at heart”), one noun to another (“the sound of music”), one pronoun to another (“Are you with him?”), and so on. The choice of a preposition can deter- mine the meaning of a sentence. “He ran into the building” and “He ran from the building,” though differing by only one word, have opposite meanings. In many cases idiom, not meaning, dictates which preposition to use. “Visi- tors are forbidden to enter” but “prohib- ited from entering.” ( See FORBID, PROHIBIT, and BAN; Gerund, 3. ) Depending on how it is used, the same word may go with different preposi- tions. “Twelve is equivalent [adjective] to a dozen” but “Twelve is the equiva- lent [noun] of a dozen.” / “I agree to the deal” but “I agree with you.” (The first agree means to give approval; the second means to concur.) More examples ap- pear in 7. Prepositions are not all tiny words; they include against, around, between, during, through, toward, without, and some that comprise more than one word, such as according to, because of, by means of, in regard to, and on ac- count of. The noun or pronoun (or other sub- stantive) that the preposition pertains to is called the object of the preposition. A pronoun that serves as the object takes the objective case. “The town stood be- hind him, ” not “he.” ( See Pronouns, 10. ) The preposition plus the object (and any modifier of it) is a prepositional phrase, e.g., behind him in the last exam- ple and the following emphasized words: “Violin with guitar makes a pleasant sound.” / Under that tree is a good place to rest.” The phrases are acting as ad- verb, adjective, and noun respectively. 2. Ambiguity One might expect the little preposi- tions of and for to be clear in meaning, and usually they are. But each has many meanings and can become cloudy in cer- tain contexts. “ ‘They have a valid complaint,’ said Dawis of the squatters.” Was Dawis one of the squatters? “Of” could mean from or belonging to. However, the context (a news story) indicates that about was meant; it would have been a more suit- able preposition. A book on words mentions “ achthronym, a word H. L. Mencken used for an ethnic slur . . . .” Those unfa- miliar with the combining form -onym, used in classifying words and names, could get the idea that the writer Mencken used the word as a slur against an ethnic group. “For” could give that impression. To mean or to denote, a verb, would be more precise. An almanac says that Boris Yeltsin urged fast reform and “championed the cause for national reconstruction. . . .” Was “the cause” reform? It was proba- bly “national reconstruction,” but the for is ambiguous; it could mean in the in- terest of. “. . . The cause of ” would be clearer and more idiomatic. The headline “Guards Use Rifles in Quentin Killing” suggests that prison guards shot someone to death. Actually, one inmate stabbed another, whereupon a guard fired at and wounded the at- tacker. The copy editor evidently had a peripheral role for “in” in mind; instead, it drags the using of rifles smack into the “Killing.” He probably avoided any- thing as straightforward as “San Quentin Inmate Is Fatally Stabbed” be- cause a competing paper got the news first. See also 6. prepositions 299 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 299"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"3. Ending with a preposition The word preposition, a relative of the Latin praepositus, meaning placed in front, should not be taken literally. Sometimes a preposition goes at the end of a sentence. A newspaper quotes an eyewitness as saying on Israeli radio: “Everybody was hysterical, and nobody knew where the bullets would come from.” There is nothing wrong with the quoted sentence (as long as it was quoted and translated correctly). Anyone who says you cannot end any sentence with a preposition does not know what he is talking about. He would probably change the foregoing to “. . . does not know about what he is talking.” The notion was called by H. W. Fowler a once “cherished superstition” and by Winston Churchill “an arrant pedantry up with which I will not put.” It originates in the Latin language. Placing a preposition at the end may weaken a sentence, strengthen it, or do neither. It depends on the sentence. “. . . Nobody knew from where the bul- lets would come” is a weakened version of the opening sample. Many great writers have ended sen- tences with prepositions. Shakespeare wrote: “It is an honor that I dream not of” ( Romeo and Juliet ) and “It would be spoke to” ( Hamlet ). Prepositions end various common ex- pressions, such as to have or not have “a leg to stand on” / “to be reckoned with” / “that’s what ——— are for” / “where I come from.” 4. Insufficient prepositions One preposition may or may not be enough for a compound predicate; that is, a predicate with more than one verb. (The predicate is the part of a sentence that expresses the action.) One preposi- tion is enough in this compound sen- tence: “He ranted and raved about his wife’s alleged unfaithfulness.” The next one, from a telecast, has one correct preposition but lacks a second: He was treated and released from a nearby hospital. Released goes with from but “treated” does not. A person is treated at or in a hospital, not “from” a hospital. This is one possible correction: “He was treated at and released from a nearby hospital.” Better: “He was treated at a nearby hos- pital and released.” Two similar sentences, from newspa- pers, are likewise inadequate: Another victim was transported to St. Francis Memorial Hospital, where he was treated and released for minor in- juries. Mike K——, 38 , was treated and released from Marin General Hospital for smoke inhalation and first- and second-degree burns on his head. . . . The first sentence of that pair says the victim was “released for” injuries, an ab- surd juxtaposition. Here is a correction: “Another victim was transported to St. Francis Memorial Hospital, treated there for minor injuries, and released.” In the second of the pair, “treated” does not go with “from” and, again, “re- leased” does not go with “for.” Try this: “Mike . . . suffered from smoke inhala- tion [etc.]. . . . He was treated at Marin General Hospital and released.” H. W. Fowler called attention to what he labeled “CANNIBALISM,” a sad practice in which “words devour their own kind.” For instance: The most vital problem in the etymo- logical study of English place-names is the question as to what extent per- sonal names occur in place-names. 300 prepositions 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 300"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"“As to” and “to what” need separate to ’s, but one to is missing—swallowed by the other one, as Fowler would say. A sentence by Fowler himself evi- dences a swallowed preposition: . . . It means, beyond a doubt, a cus- tom that one deserves more honour for breaking than for keeping. . . . A for has been swallowed, so to speak, immediately after honour (the British spelling of honor ). If for for is not to one’s liking, an alternative correction is to change “that” to for which. ( See also HONORABLE [etc.] 3. ) More examples appear in TO, 1. 5. Misplacement An adjective and a preposition that commonly go together, like similar to or different from, should not be split apart. This sentence, from a computer book, splits them apart: . . . The Toolbox has its own title bar and System menu, with similar properties to the publication title bar and System menu. A correction is “properties similar to the publication. . . .” (The sentence needs more fixing, for it compares unlike things. Make it “properties similar to those of the publication. . . .”) Prepositions are liable to be misplaced in sentences containing correlative con- junctions like both . . . and and ei- ther . . . or. “The bill has been passed both by the Senate and the House of Representatives.” Make it by both. “He has no faith either in the Democrats or the Republicans.” Make it in either. Now in each sentence the preposition ( by or in ) affects both nouns, not just the first; and we uphold the rule of correla- tive conjunctions: The same grammati- cal form that follows the first conjunction of the pair must follow the second, somewhat in the manner of a mathematical equation. See also BOTH, 1; EITHER, 1; NEITHER, 1; NOT ONLY. 6. Omission The casual speaker or writer some- times omits on and of when they are needed and sticks them in when they are not needed. “ On the first day” and “a couple of kids” are typical phrases in which prepositions are subject to omis- sion, contrary to idiom. See ON, 1; COUPLE, 4. This sentence, from a book of travel adventure, omits another idiomatic preposition: Mid-afternoon we passed a ruined hamlet of stone and shortly after it reached an ancient and revered mosque. It would improve the sentence to start it with In. Adverbs representing times of day do not usually open sentences. (An- other improvement would be to drop “it,” which tends to fuse with “reached.”) A similar omission impairs a sentence by a food critic: Multiply your weight times 13 to get a rough idea of how many calories you can consume a day. Divide the total by 4 , and that’s how many fat calories you can handle. You can “consume a day” repairing your house or operating your computer. As for the sample sentence, it would be improved either by “how many calories you can consume in a day” or by “how many calories a day you can consume.” An a or an may be enough when sand- wiched between the nouns denoting units and time. But the preposition in should precede a when units and time are further apart. The statistical preposi- prepositions 301 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 301"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"tion per fits either context: “calories per day” or “calories you can consume per day.” Prepositions, especially of, are often omitted in efforts to be concise. The re- sult can be ambiguity. “A small sculpture collection” could mean either “a collec- tion of small sculptures” or “a small col- lection of sculptures.” A more complicated example: “The curbing of public meetings and the publication of newspapers eliminated most opposition to the regime.” As it stands, “the curbing of public meetings” and “the publication of newspapers” may appear to be paral- lel factors. But if “curbing” controls the latter phrase (a more likely assumption), precede the phrase by of: “The curbing of public meetings and of the publication of newspapers . . .” If the meaning is clear, omission of prepositions is tolerable in headlines, such as the following, which appeared in one newspaper edition: “Police seek Ne- tanyahu indictment” / “Oil industry fights gas additive ban” / “Group urges tough rules for hydrofluoric acid use” / “Panel OKs flood aid package.” In texts, clarity and grace call for “ . . . indictment of Netanyahu / “. . . ban on gas addi- tives ” (or, better, “ gasoline additives”) / “ . . . use of hydrofluoric acid” / “ . . . package of flood aid.” 7. Selection of a preposition Learning which preposition goes with each verb, adjective, noun, or pronoun is a daunting task for the foreign student of English, sometimes for the native speaker too. The choice of preposition often depends on idiom, rather than logic. The same word may go with two prepositions, depending on meaning: Agree to means to consent to or ap- prove something; agree with means to be of the same opinion as, or to be suitable for. Belong to means to be a member of; belong with means to deserve being clas- sified among. Capacity for means apti- tude for; capacity of means the most that can be contained in. Compare to means to liken to; compare with means to con- trast with. ( See COMPARED TO and COMPARED WITH, 1. ) Concur in means to express approval of (an opin- ion or joint action); concur with means to agree with (someone). Correspond to means to match; correspond with means to exchange letters with. Differ from means to be unlike; differ with means to disagree with. In behalf of means in the interest of; on behalf of means as the agent of. Liable for means responsible for; liable to means apt to. (In) sympathy with means in agreement with; sympa- thy for means compassion for. Wait for is to be inactive and in anticipation of; wait on is to serve (someone food or drink). ( See WAIT FOR and WAIT ON. ) Even when the meaning does not change much, the preposition may vary with context. A conversation between two people is a conversation among three. ( See BETWEEN, 1. ) A patient is cured of a disease but cured by a treat- ment. One is grateful for a benefit but grateful to a person. One may intervene in a dispute but intervene between those disputing. A buyer is in the market for a product; a product is on the market. Someone gains mastery of a skill or sub- ject; a ruler or regime gains mastery over a country or people. A report of an acci- dent appears in the paper; the govern- ment submits a report on the economy. One may speak on a subject but speak to a person. ( See SPEAK TO, TALK TO. ) In the press on often assumes func- tions that would be better served by other prepositions. ( See ON, 3. ) In news items about arrests, for can be prejudi- cial. ( See Guilt and Innocence, 5. ) An occasional error in the choice of prepositions goes like this (numbers added): “He will be in the best possible position for [ 1 ] getting the most out of the land and of [ 2 ] using it to the best possible advantage.” Although for 302 prepositions 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 302"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"would apply to both 1 and 2 , the writer chose to precede the second phrase with an extra preposition to be clearer; but in- stead of repeating for, which would make sense, he carelessly copied “of,” the last preposition he saw. See also 1, 2; DIFFERENT, 1; Gerund, 3B; INTO, 1; RALLY; WITH PREJUDICE (etc.). 8. Superfluous preposition A newspaper ran the headline “Regu- lators’ beef with selling milk for cheap.” The “for” was unnecessary and unid- iomatic. “. . . Selling milk cheap” (or cheaply ) is enough. You do not say “moving for quick” or “coming for soon.” That is an example of a superfluous preposition, one that is used unnecessar- ily with a particular word. Some promi- nent examples include “for” before free, “of” after off, and “from” before whence. A series may be marred by an extra preposition, as in this extract from a news story: Its history has been reconstructed from ticket stubs found on the floor, dressing room graffiti and from inter- views with older black residents of Athens. . . . The first “from” covers all the three items enumerated. The other “from” is superfluous, inasmuch as no preposition precedes the second item, “dressing room graffiti.” See also Series errors, 9. In numerical ranges, prepositions are liable to pile up: “A high temperature of from 70 to 75 degrees is forecast.” Omit from. “The gadget is priced at between $ 40 and $ 50 .” Omit at. This example is similar in its causes to the one at the end of 7: “It could be done without unduly raising the price of coal or of jeopardizing new trade.” Omit the second of; no preposition belongs there at all. See also ADVOCATE; FREE, 1; OFF and “OFF OF”; ON, 2; WHENCE and “FROM WHENCE”; WISH; WITH. PRE- prefix. The prefix pre- means before, beforehand, early, in advance of, or in front of. An example appears in the noun prefix itself (originating in the Latin prae-, before, and figere, to fix). Other examples are adjectives, such as preadolescent (youngsters), precancer- ous (lesions), prefabricated (houses); verbs, to predominate, to prejudge; and more nouns, prescription, preview. If such a meaning is obvious without it, pre- is probably unnecessary. These sentences are redundant: “Advance pay- ment of the initiation fee and the first year’s dues is a precondition of member- ship.” / “We won’t begin operations without careful preplanning.” / “On January 2 all students must preregister for courses.” / “Before buying the car, have a mechanic pretest it.” Radio commercials for two respected automotive brands have offered “pre- owned models” and “certified preowned automobiles.” The merchandise is what most Americans call used cars. A sign at a bookstore: “PREVIOUSLY READ BOOKS & MAGAZINES.” When the prefix pre- is followed by e, many publications separate the two e ’s with a hyphen. It indicates that the long vowel sound in pre- (PREE) is followed by a short vowel sound: pre-eminent, pre-emption, pre-existing. ( Pre- has a short vowel in some words, including preliminary and preserve. ) A hyphen is necessary when the second element starts with a capital letter: pre- Columbian. The Associated Press hy- phenates pre-convention, pre-dawn, and any combinations that are not in a cer- tain dictionary. PREREQUISITE and PERQUI- SITE. See PERQUISITE and PRE- REQUISITE. prerequisite and perquisite 303 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 303"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"PRESCRIBE and PROSCRIBE. An article says a federal law “proscribed that the tax on capital gains be the same as the top rate on incomes.” The sen- tence says the opposite of what its writer intended. “Proscribed” should be pre- scribed. To pr e scribe something is to e s- tablish it as a rule. To pr o scribe something is to o utlaw it. The law estab- lished that tax rule; it did not outlaw it. PRESENTLY. The meaning of presently seemed to slow down over the centuries. It used to mean now until that meaning became obsolete, except for di- alects, some three hundred years ago. Later it came to mean immediately; still later, soon. “The queen is expected to ar- rive presently.” / “The small gathering presently grew into a huge crowd.” The original meaning, now, has been revived. But several authorities prefer to restrict presently to the meaning of soon, before long, or in a short time, so as to avoid any confusion from a second meaning. They would not look with fa- vor on these press uses: “[His] yearly salary is . . . presently the highest in the country . . . .” / “. . . The group is presently about $ 30 , 000 in debt.” / “Presently, a few Monterey pines . . . grow on the block-long site.” In those sentences “presently” plainly means now, but the meaning can be blurred: “I believe presently the venture will be profitable.” Does “presently” re- fer to the speaker’s belief or to the fu- ture? One can sidestep the issue, saving two syllables at the same time, by replacing “presently” with now when that is the meaning. Those who scorn now because a little monosyllable does not seem im- portant enough can draw upon cur- rently, at present, or at this time. For those wishing to drag it out still further, a phrase associated with Watergate is available: See “AT THIS POINT IN TIME.” Even now or a synonym is often un- necessary in sentences that are in the pre- sent tense. Delete “presently” from the three press quotations and it remains ob- vious that the time is the present. Now or a synonym is useful for em- phasis or for contrasting the present with the past or the future. “ Now she tells me!” / “He’s sorry now, but what of the future?” / “I used to be married, but I’m not at present.” Present tense. See Tense. PRESS (verb). See ADVOCATE. PRESUMPTIVE and PRESUMP- TUOUS. See Confusing pairs. Preterit, preterite (past tense). See Tense. PREVENT. To prevent (verb, transi- tive) is to avert or thwart; to keep (some- one or something) from doing something; or to keep (something) from happening. All of these constructions are id- iomatic: ( 1 ) “Run the water slowly to prevent overflowing”; ( 2 ) “ . . . prevent it from overflowing”; ( 3 ) “ . . . prevent its overflowing.” What is unidiomatic is “to prevent it overflowing.” From or a possessive form ( see Gerund, 4 ) should precede the -ing word. Neither of them does in this press sentence: The challenge facing the two sides in South Africa is to find a formula which incorporates some of these ele- ments into a constitution which will prevent South Africa going the same way as the rest of Africa. It should be “prevent South Africa from going . . .” or “prevent South Africa’s going. . . .” (For more clarity, the first “which” should be that; it is used restric- 304 prescribe and proscribe 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 304"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"tively. Whether the reporter meant to use the second “which” in the same way is uncertain. See THAT and WHICH. ) PRIMATES. A caption under a pho- tograph of two chimpanzees says, “Pri- mates are much more vegetarian in their diet than humans,” which is something like saying that rodents run faster than mice. Humans are primates. Primates is an order of animals, the most highly devel- oped order. It comprises man, ape, mon- key, lemur, loris, and tarsier. As a taxonomic order, Primates is capitalized, singular though ending in s, and pro- nounced pry-MAY-tease. A member of the order is a primate, pronounced PRY- mate. An item deals with a “toddler who fell into a Chicago zoo’s gorilla pit and was rescued by a 160 -pound primate. . . .” The last word is neither wrong nor pre- cise (I have been a 160 -pound primate myself) but a synonym obviously chosen to avoid repeating gorilla. See also APE and MONKEY. PRINCIPAL and PRINCIPLE. A political consultant was quoted as say- ing, “It was a credible message, based on very broad philosophical principal.” The last word amounted to a misquotation. A newspaper reporter had heard it right but spelled it wrong. One speaks of a philosophical princi- ple (except in some rare instance of a school principal who is a philosopher). This noun denotes a law of nature, a ba- sic truth or postulate, a cause to which one is dedicated, an essential element or quality, or a rule of conduct. (It might aid one’s memory to note the -le ending in both rule and principle. ) The noun principal denotes the head of a school, or a main participant, or the amount of a debt or investment without the interest. As an adjective, principal means first in rank or importance, pri- mary, primal. (Note the -al ending in both primal and principal. ) PRIORITIZE. See -IZE ending. PRIOR, PRIOR TO. Using “prior to” as a genteel synonym for before, in the manner of this press example, serves no useful purpose: “Officer Malcom M—— said prior to last month, the last vehicle to go over the cliff was in 1978 ....” In formal writing, prior to (adverb) may be used to emphasize that one event is a prerequisite to the other: “Citizens must register prior to voting.” Prior (adjective) without the to is more useful. It can mean preceding in importance, in order, or in time: “a prior consideration” / “his prior choice” / “my prior appointment.” (As for the press sentence: “said that ” would be clearer, unless the officer said it “prior to last month.” See THAT, 2. The month should have been stated; the story appeared on the first.) PRISTINE. A television screen de- picted a suburban park. Now it is “pris- tine” wilderness, but it used to be the site of explosives manufacturing, the narra- tor said. He was nearly contradicting himself. If it was an industrial site, it is no longer “pristine,” although it could have returned to a state of wilderness. Pristine (adjective) describes an early period, predating the touch of man; or an original, unspoiled condition. It comes from the Latin pristinus, former. On a radio talk show, a commentator on popular culture spoke of television’s “very pristine image” of the police and “pristine image of doctors.” Perhaps he thought it meant pure. A TV newscaster may have had that idea too; he said the study of Lake Tahoe began four decades ago when the water was “relatively pris- tine.” To qualify pristine with “very” or “relatively” is dubious; something either pristine 305 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 305"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"is pristine or it is not. In each instance it was not. Probability. See Numbers, 10C. PROBABLE, PROBABLY. See AP- PARENT, APPARENTLY. PROBATION. See PAROLE and PROBATION. PROBE. A probe is an instrument used by physicians in examining wounds, cavities, or sinuses. Often made of silver, usually thin and flexible with a blunt end, it serves to determine the depth and direction of those depressions. To probe (verb, transitive and intransi- tive) is literally to examine with a probe. Originating in the Latin probare, to test (the origin of prove ), the English noun dates at least to the sixteenth cen- tury; the verb, to the seventeenth. A figu- rative meaning of the verb, to search into with the aim of exploring or discovering, developed almost at the same time as the literal. The sense of interrogating closely came out of the nineteenth century. In the mid-twentieth, probe became associated with congressional hearings. Headlines used it freely, as both verb and noun; the thirteen letters of investigation could not compete with the five letters of probe. Though inquiry was not much longer, it never caught on. Writers and speakers too adopted that headline word for general use. Within several days, the national TV audience heard on a newscast that the Senate planned “to launch a widespread probe of voter fraud” in Louisiana; on a news feature program that a “task force conducted a lengthy probe” into cus- toms corruption; on one discussion pro- gram that the Louisiana election was “now being probed” and an indepen- dent counsel was needed “to probe the White House scandal”; and on another discussion program that “Hillary was the central figure in a probe. . . .” At The New York Times, a creditable standing rule has been “Do not use [ probe ] for inquiry, investigation or in- vestigate. ” The rule does not prevent specialized use, as in space probe.

For instance, “Stand beside her and guide her ” substitutes for “Stand be- side America and guide America ” in a famous song. Pronouns are handy de- vices, enabling us to avoid having to re- peat names, words, or whole phrases all the time. ( See also Pronouns’ classifica- tion. ) Usually, if a pronoun is not to do more harm than good, it must be clear just what it is replacing. Because of de- fective phrasing or organization, it can be unclear which noun a given pronoun represents (i.e., which is its antecedent ) 306 probability 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 306"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"or the pronoun can literally apply to the wrong noun. Sometimes it is better to use no pronoun and repeat the noun. The first sample statement is by a well-known reporter on a TV “maga- zine” program. It is not clear which per- son was “he.” When P—— was hired by H——, he had a criminal record. The following sentence, a paragraph in itself, is from a news agency’s dis- patch. Another witness, Drazen E——, testified that he had participated in the slaughter of up to 1 , 200 Sre- brenica Muslims in one day. It seems to say that the witness admitted participating in the crime. But the con- text indicates that “he” was meant to apply to someone else, an army general identified earlier in the story. Read in iso- lation, the sentence defames the witness. Its only subjects are the proper noun and the personal pronoun. Hence it is rea- sonable for a reader to assume that the pronoun represents the noun. Instead of “he,” the general or the general’s name should have been used. The succeeding illustrations come from newspapers in five cities. Rules were changed to open up the nominating process after the 1968 convention, in which Chicago Mayor Richard Daley and other bosses deliv- ered the nomination to Hubert Humphrey while his police beat heads outside the convention. In “his police,” to whom does “his” re- fer? The meaning suggests that it refers to Daley, but the “his” tends to cling to “Humphrey” because they are so close. The sentence would be improved by changing “his” to the mayor’s. A report on the origin of Arabian aid for the Nicaraguan Contras quoted the president, described a congressional in- vestigation into the matter, and followed with excerpts from the testimony of Robert C. McFarlane. Emphasis is added to the questionable pronoun, at the end. Sen. William S. Cohen (R-Me.) said he was troubled by “the definition of solicitation” of funds. Although he has talked of Reagan’s meeting with Fahd, McFarlane on Wednesday refused to term any dis- cussion of the contras’ needs a solici- tation of aid. “It seems to me that we have been engaged in this exercise of trying to define how many foreign leaders can be made to dance on the head of the President’s contra program without calling it a solicitation,” he said. Who said? Since McFarlane was the last name mentioned, a reader can reason- ably assume that McFarlane is the man now being quoted. But the essence of the message has changed. Actually “he” is Senator Cohen. (I wrote to him and he confirmed that he made the statement.) It would have avoided confusion to in- terchange the first and second para- graphs. The existing order presents a confusing “he” in the second paragraph too: A reader may at first take it to be Senator Cohen, the person last men- tioned, but that “he” is McFarlane. Here is an excerpt from a news story about speeches made by Jesse Jackson during his second campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination: He termed Mr. Dukakis’s proposals “very conservative, very cautious, very inadequate.” Today Mr. Jackson said, in refer- ence to Mr. Dukakis, “a cautious ap- proach without commitment will not pronouns 307 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 307"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"satisfy our basic needs.” About his proposals, he added, “Democrats in Atlanta will rejoice at this budget.” Whose proposals are “his” proposals? Since “Mr. Dukakis’s proposals” were mentioned just two sentences ago and since the story says Mr. Jackson is speak- ing “in reference to Mr. Dukakis,” it is plausible to assume that “his” refers to Mr. Dukakis. Yet it would not make sense for a candidate to predict rejoicing over a rival’s proposals, unless the candi- date is speaking ironically. The context indicates that “his” probably means Mr. Jackson’s. If so, the confusion could have been avoided by the insertion of a three-letter word: “About his own pro- posals. . . .” This is from an article on the prosecu- tion of parents who depend on faith healing for their children: Over the years, Christian Science lobbyists have succeeded in either drafting or playing a significant role in the wording of religious exemption statutes in the child welfare codes of 47 states. And while they insist that the statutes were designed to protect them from exactly the legal nightmare they now face, prosecutors argue that the laws do not cover manslaughter or other serious crimes. Who are “them” and “they”? If the sec- ond paragraph is considered alone, those pronouns seem to stand for “prosecu- tors,” but such an interpretation would not be reasonable. The first “they” could reasonably apply to the “lobbyists” mentioned in the previous paragraph, but “them” and the second “they” could not; the lobbyists would not be likely to argue that the statutes were designed to protect the lobbyists. “Them” and the second “they” probably apply to no- body mentioned in either paragraph. The writer should have discarded the first two pronouns and used nouns, per- haps in this manner: “And while the lob- byists insist that the statutes were designed to protect Christian Scientists from. . . .” The W——s are the Long Island couple cited by Eugene police last month after they offered University of Oregon students money to engage in sex with Nancy W——, 44 . Because “they” soon follows “police,” a reader may think that “they” represents “police,” although further reading of the article will correct such an interpreta- tion. Instead of a muddy pronoun, the couple’s surname should have been re- peated. Meeting reporters later after chang- ing out of her prison clothes, Morgan said her daughter was better off than she was when her mother started the jail term. Was “Morgan” imprisoned along with her mother? The parallel phrasing of “her daughter” and “her mother” seems to suggest that. However, the full story says nothing about a grandmother being locked up. Probably “her mother” means “Morgan,” but another “Mor- gan” would be awkward. The best solu- tion is to rephrase part of the sentence: “. . . better off than she had been when the jail term began.” By noon, Rosie—surrounded by her mom and dad . . . —had her mare. And this morning when she wakes up, she can run out to her own corral and watch her own horse in her new home.

Nothing is said in the article about Rosie’s moving, how- ever, so the fifth “her” seems to be the horse. It would have forestalled the con- fusion to put the horse in the neuter gen- der: “ its new home.” Ambiguity in the use of relative pro- nouns comes up in THAT and WHICH; WHICH, 1; WHO, 1. How misunder- standing can occur when such a pronoun ( that ) is not placed immediately after its antecedent is illustrated in Modifiers, 3B (end). 2. Disagreement in number A. An individual gets a singular pronoun This is all about grammar. A spokesman for a group supporting what it called a woman’s right to choose (abortion) was quoted in the press as saying, “This is all about an individual’s right to make a choice about their indi- vidual lives.” Plainly “an individual” is singular. What can be more singular? It does not agree with “their . . . lives,” which is plural. It would, however, agree with her . . . life, which is singular. Hav- ing erroneously associated “individual” with “their,” the speaker proceeded to give that individual a number of “lives.” Disagreement between a noun (such as “individual”) and a pronoun pertain- ing to it (such as “their”) is a common mistake in grammar. Usually the mis- taker tries to represent a singular noun by means of a plural pronoun. A book of popular psychology says: It’s as if we’re waiting for permis- sion to start living fully. But the only person who can give us that permis- sion is ourselves. A “person” is not “ourselves.” One is singular, the other plural. “But the only person who can give you that permission is you ” would be grammatically correct. Yet the excerpt is part of a paragraph that uses we, us, or our twenty-one times; a version consistent with all the plurality is this: “But the only persons [or “the only ones ”] who can give us that permission are ourselves.” (Still more proper: “ are we. ” See 10D. ) Further examples are taken from a book about English words, a state’s tax form, and two news articles: For the dedicated dictionary browser a new edition is a great joy, but sometimes their pleasure in dis- covering new words is tempered by the loss of the old. Did you live with any other person who claimed you as a dependent on their income tax return? The study . . . found that the older a person is, the faster their infection progresses to AIDS diseases. . . . if a suggestion is made to an anesthetized patient to make a specific gesture in an interview days later, they will probably make the gesture, al- though they will not be aware what they have done or why they have done it. Changing “their” to his would correct the first three examples. In the fourth, change “they” to he four times and “have” to has twice. Singulars will then match singulars. A browser, a person, or a patient is singular, as is an aviator, the dentist, Aunt Fifi, an infant, the president, Cap- tain John Smith, a thespian, a zoo keeper, or anyone else. Their is plural. So is they or them. Each of those th words pertains to more than one person or thing. It is a long-standing rule of grammar that a pronoun referring to a singular pronouns 309 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 309"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"noun must be singular; a pronoun refer- ring to a plural noun must be plural. Personal pronouns referring to one person, aside from you and me, are he and she (in the subjective case); him and her (in the objective case); and his, her, and hers (in the possessive case). It and its are considered in B. See also ONE as pronoun. What if we do not know if the person is male or female, or what if the sex does not matter? He, him, or his then repre- sents a person of either sex. The editor and grammarian Patricia T. O’Conner writes in Woe Is I that she cringes when she hears a sentence like “Somebody forgot to pay their bill” in- stead of “pay his bill.” She perceives good intentions but bad grammar. “The pronouns he and his have been used since time immemorial to refer to people in general.” That a pronoun in the masculine gen- der can represent any person when sex is immaterial or unknown has been long established in law as well as grammar. Black’s Law Dictionary says he is “usu- ally used . . . to include both sexes as well as corporations” and his too “may refer to a person of either sex.” Oxford’s A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage says: . . . The traditional view, still to be ob- served in the most formal contexts, is that the masculine pronouns are generic, comprehending both male and female. Thus cumbersome pairs such as he or she and his or her are usually unnecessary. Such a pair can be unwieldy in a sen- tence with several pronouns (like the one about the anesthetized patient). And it can be conspicuous unless the matter of sex is pertinent or, as in the example be- low, both male and female are men- tioned. A college advertised: The alternative to night school: Week- end College. The least disruptive way for a working man or woman to re- turn for their degree. A “man or woman” is singular. ( See OR. ) Thus “their” should be his or her or simply a. (We will overlook the lack of a complete sentence.) While English has riches, it has some shortcomings; it lacks, for instance, a multipurpose possessive pronoun like the Spanish su. (In Britain, as Shake- speare indicates, some used an unac- cented a or a’ in lieu of he, she, they, it, or I. ) Nevertheless, for anyone who in- sists on reading sexual significance into his pronouns, there is always the option of rephrasing a thought, e.g.: for dedi- cated dictionary browsers / on an in- come tax return / the faster an infection progresses / the patient will probably make the gesture, without being aware of it / pay the bill. It is a better answer to the limitations of our language than childish barbarism. The errors can be droll. A book on first aid warns of danger from the black widow spider, brown recluse spider, and scorpion, and it says: If a person is bitten by any of the three, have them lie down and not walk. But what if the creatures don’t want to lie down? B. IT, ITS: pronoun in the neuter gender A book of travel adventure says: If one has never seen a grand African river their beauty comes as a wonder- ful surprise. River is singular. “Their” is plural; it should be its (preceded by a comma). As a rule, an inanimate, nonliving, or 310 pronouns 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 310"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"abstract thing takes the singular, neuter pronoun it or its. Traditionally she and her have been applied to a ship or coun- try—“Aye, tear her tattered ensign down”—but it and its will do for either.

(The possessive cannot apply to “PINEAPPLE,” which is serving as an adjective. If the label said “CHUNKS OF PINEAPPLE,” then “PINEAPPLE” as a noun could possess “ITS OWN JUICE.”) It or its may be used for a baby, par- ticularly if it represents babies in general: “A newborn needs its mother.” An article about children’s learning of language quotes a linguist: Dr. C—— concludes that “a 1 1 ⁄ 2 - year-old knows a lot about containers and surfaces, but they don’t know the words ‘on’ or ‘in.’ ” “A 1 1 ⁄ 2 -year-old” is singular and conflicts with “they,” which is plural. The final clause may be corrected this way: “. . . but it doesn’t know the words. . . .” An alternative correction would start out plural: “ 1 1 ⁄ 2 -year-olds know a lot. . . .” (In either case, change “or” to and; that will produce a plural to agree with words. See OR. ) It or its applies also to an animal, un- less its sex is known and material. A radio physician advised a caller, “Take the dog to the doctor and give them the penicillin.” The dog has no choice, but what if the doctor resists? C. (-)ONE words and phrases; -BODY words; EACH; EVERY A school principal might be expected to know the grammatical rules that are taught to children. One principal said, in a speech acknowledging his winning of the title of “educator of the year,” it is the job of educators to insure “that every one of those children know more than they knew the year before.” This educa- tor may not be up to the job, unless he knows more than he knew at the time of that speech. Obviously one is singular. So is any phrase ending in one, including any one, each one, every one, and no one. So is any word ending in -one, including any- one, everyone, and someone. So are the -body pronouns: anybody, everybody, nobody, and somebody. We say “Every- body knows, ” not “know”; and “Every- one is here,” not “are.” Each also is singular, particularly as a subject. ( See EACH, EACH OF. ) A possessive that refers to any of the pronouns just men- tioned should be singular, just as the re- lated verb should be singular. Similarly the adjective every makes what it modi- fies singular. Examples: “Is anyone missing his keys?” / “Everyone must buy her own dress.” / “I see everybody brought his or her spouse.” / “Somebody sends her re- gards.” / “Every man for himself.” / “To each his own.” (Nobody sings “To each their own.”) Two news stories and a book about pronouns 311 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 311"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"English (quoted earlier) display the same kind of mistake: The state Elections Code requires anyone who raises more than $ 500 to disclose their finances.

A congressman being interviewed on television was partly right and partly wrong: Each candidate has to make his or her own decision on how they play this [the issue of impeachment]. He recognized the singularness of “each candidate” by correctly saying “his or her own decision” but failed to follow through: “on how he or she plays this.” If he wanted to express the same mes- sage more concisely, he could have said “his own decision on how he plays this.” Sometimes there is disagreement in number even when the subject is plainly female or male. In an editorial column, a sentence appeared that should have been deemed unfit to print. A new publisher had just taken over the newspaper, and here was his first statement. Referring to his predecessors—his grandfather, uncle, and father—he wrote: Each of these men, in their message upon being named Publisher, quoted the pledge Mr. Ochs made when he took the helm of the Times: To give the news impartially, without fear or favor, regardless of any party, sect or interest involved. Had the copy gone unedited? If it had been edited, did the copy editor miss the offending “their” in place of his or was he afraid to correct the boss? (The pub- lisher added a pledge that the paper would continue to adhere to its tradi- tional “high standards of journalism and business.” Its standards of grammar used to be high too.) See also EVERYBODY, EVERYONE, 4; EVERY ONE and EVERYONE; ONE as pronoun. 3. Lack of reflexive A pronoun misses the mark in each of these passages (by a lawyer, an anchor man, and two journalists respectively): “I ultimately refused to go, thereby depriving me of the ability to partici- pate. . . .” What did one man do to land him in court? Mr. McCain, for example, must stand for re-election . . . giving him less time to recover. A . . . motorist . . . lost control of her car and slammed into two oncoming cars, killing her instantly .... Change “me” to myself, each “him” to himself, and the second “her” to herself. Each of the emphasized words is a re- flexive pronoun. The action that the sub- ject performs is done to the subject; it reflects back onto him or her. The suffix -self or -selves indicates reflexiveness. Other pronouns of that type are the singular words itself, oneself, and your- self and the plural words ourselves, themselves, and yourselves. Often a -self pronoun is used when it should not be. “Myself,” in place of me, is the most common one. See 4. Some- times a nonstandard form, like “their- selves,” is used. See 5. (In the third example, “stand” is dubious. See RUN and STAND. ) 312 pronouns 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 312"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"4. Needless use of -SELF Many people are reluctant to use the simple word me, possibly fearing that they will be considered ungrammatical or immodest. Their concern may hark back to school days and a confusion about “I” versus “me.” So they use “my- self,” thinking wrongly that it is a safe word. Two books furnish our first pair of examples: In late 1965 , the Chicago Zoologi- cal Park . . . sent an expedition to Mexico consisting of myself and pho- tographer Alan ———. Special tools were cut by myself [to bind a book]. “Myself” should be me in both excerpts: “consisting of me ” and “cut by me. ” In the latter instance, “ I cut special tools” would be still better. The suffix -self or -selves in a pronoun serves either of these two functions: 1 . It makes the pronoun reflexive. A re- flexive pronoun turns the action back upon the subject (the performer of the action). Examples: “She talks to herself.” / “The boy doesn’t know what to do with himself.” / “We gave ourselves raises.” / “The cat is wash- ing itself.” / “I cut myself.” / “They blame themselves.” / “Do yourself a favor.” 2 . It gives emphasis to the subject. “In- stead of calling the plumber, Agnes fixed the sink herself.” / “He called for law and order when he himself was a crook.” / “Jack himself says he’s unqualified for the job.” / “No one helped, so I did it all myself.” The “-self” in the following sample serves neither function. Dr. Lowery said plans for the classes were not finished but they . . . would probably include two one-hour sessions with himself and other black leaders. Change “himself” to him. There is no reason for the “-self”: it has no effect on the subject of the clause in which it ap- pears. That subject is “they,” referring to plans for the classes. A TV news correspondent in Moscow was reporting on a violent revolution and an author was describing an African trip: Myself and other members of the press were pinned down. . . . Henry, Ann, myself and Joseph were in the little Renault 12 station wagon. If no one else had been present, neither narrator would say “Myself was pinned down” or “Myself was in the little Re- nault.” Each would say “ I was.” Bring- ing in others as part of the subject makes no difference in the use of the pronoun. Change each “myself” to I. 5. Nonstandard -SELF or -SELVES words In California a man and a woman were injured by explosives and then ar- rested on suspicion of illegal possession of (the same) explosives. A TV news- caster reported the happening and named names. “Police said ——— and ——— built the bombs theirselves,” she announced. Later the two were released for lack of evidence, notwithstanding what “police said.” Aside from other misfortune, they had been subjected to the indignity of being defamed with atrocious English. “Theirselves” is not a legitimate word. The proper pronoun is them- selves. It is the plural of himself or her- self. Some illegitimate relatives that occa- sionally pop up are “hisself” / “theirself” pronouns 313 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 313"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"/ “themself” / “ourself.” They are not ac- cepted as English words. The plural of myself is properly ourselves. 6. Omission A. Isolation of verb In a complicated sentence it may not be clear who is performing some of the action. A verb seems to lack a subject. The forty-five-word sentence below of- fers a good illustration. Grasping all of its meaning calls for more than the usual effort by the reader. A party spokeswoman, Brigitte Zimmerman, told reporters that an- gry citizens recently tried to storm the secret police offices in the city of Er- furt to keep documents from being taken away, and warned of “anarchy and chaos” from “people taking the law into their own hands.” Who “warned”? That verb lacks an ob- vious subject. We need to figure it out. The previous action in the sentence was by the “angry citizens,” so they seem to be the subject. But it would be out of character for them to issue a warning of “anarchy and chaos.” We skip back- ward. “A party spokeswoman, Brigitte Zimmerman,” evidently was intended to be the subject of “warned.” Inserting one little pronoun would have forestalled all that effort. Make it “. . . and she warned. . . .” Better yet, start a new sentence with “She warned . . .” (after changing the third comma to a period and omitting the “and”). It needs to be obvious who or what is the subject of a verb; that is, who or what is performing the action. That sub- ject may not be obvious when a clause intervenes between it and the verb and when the clause’s subject (“angry citi- zens”) threatens to take over the verb (“warned”). In such a case, the verb re- quires its own subject, either noun or pronoun. The comma does not help; it just sets up another barrier. In the next two samples, the meaning may be easier to figure out, but why stint pronouns? In 1983 he sued The Review for libel after it published an article criticizing him, but dropped the suit two years later. He was foreclosed from the Bush ticket because both men have a Texas voter registration, and probably hoped that Bush would clear the decks for the next GOP generation by choosing an older running mate. Better: “. . . but he dropped . . .” / “ . . . but he probably had hoped. . . .” ( See BUT, 1; Tense, 5B. ) See also Nouns, 4; Punctuation, 3E. B. Synonym instead of pronoun It is a journalistic mannerism to use a synonym for the subject instead of a per- sonal pronoun; for instance: “Mr. Gore’s opponents had criticized the Tennessee senator about the secrecy surrounding the loans. . . .” Although readers who did not know that Mr. Gore was “the Tennessee senator” could probably guess it, him would be clearer and more natu- ral. See also JURIST; Synonymic silli- ness; THE, 2B. The avoidance of pronouns in that manner can produce outright confusion. See Synonymic silliness, 2, for examples. 7. Shift in person Much as a ball player must have a particular position, a writer or speaker needs to express a sentence from a par- ticular standpoint—the first person, the second person, or the third person. Straying could mean bungling a play, or a thought. A rather common error is the mixing of the indefinite one with “you” or an- 314 pronouns 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 314"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"other personal pronoun. This is typical: “One loses track of the time when you’re having fun.” One errs when one tries to have it both ways. Either change “One loses” to You lose (second person) or change “you’re” to one is (third person). See also ONE as pronoun, 1. A radio psychologist said, in reply to a mother who had caught her small daughter drinking beer, “I would just keep your eyes open.” The psychologist did not mean that she would literally keep someone’s eyes open; the trouble was her switch from first person to sec- ond person. The pronouns are consis- tently in the first person in this sentence: “I would just keep my eyes open” (if I were you). Alternatively, the second per- son could be chosen: (You should) “Just keep your eyes open.” Within a single paragraph, a book’s point of view shifts wildly from “we” to “one” to “you” and to “my.” (Emphasis is added to the pronouns:) To look more intimately at sand as a substance, we may seek the aid of a magnifier .... Under the lens one can see black grains, pink grains, and clear, whitish grains. Here and there you can notice even at a distance that waves and wind have somewhat sorted the diverse grains of sand by motion on a larger scale than in my hand. Although the meaning is understand- able, the vacillating style can be unset- tling. A book deals with the future of the universe: . . . The present density is very close to the critical density that separates recollapse from indefinite expansion. . . . So I am in the well- established tradition of oracles and prophets of hedging my bets by pre- dicting both ways. The tradition of oracles and prophets is that of hedging their bets, not “my” bets. A syndicated radio host said to a caller, “Jeff, you are somebody who doesn’t like to pay your taxes.” Some- body— third person—doesn’t like to pay his taxes. Why would somebody want to pay Jeff’s taxes? A news story about a senator’s ouster from a committee contained the sentence below. It swings from third person to first person and back again as the quota- tion marks come and go. “Life goes on,” he said drily, adding, “I have a fair amount of things I’ve been following for 1 , 000 years” to keep him busy. A sentence must hold together grammat- ically, even if part of it is a quotation. “ ‘ I have . . . things’ . . . to keep him busy” literally means that I will keep someone else busy. If the second quotation was obscure enough to require an explana- tion, the writer would have done well to paraphrase it all. (A paraphrase might have avoided “amount of things” in- stead of “ number of things.” See AMOUNT and NUMBER. By the way, drily is a variation of dryly. Just how illu- minating was its use?) 8. Superfluous apostrophe Its, the possessive (“Our team did its best”), should not be confused with it’s, the contraction of it is or it has (“ It’s only a penny” / “It’s been fun”). And your, the possessive (“Is that your house?”), should not be confused with you’re, the contraction of you are (“ You’re looking well”). People continu- ally mix up each homophonic pair, often inserting apostrophes in the possessive words, incorrectly. The pronouns hers, ours, theirs, and yours have no apostrophes. (“The money is hers. ” / “It’s ours. ” / “It’s pronouns 315 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 315"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"theirs. ” / “It’s yours. ”) Often someone sticks an apostrophe in. See also Possessive problems, 4; Punc- tuation, 1; ITS and IT’S; WHOSE, 2; YOUR and YOU’RE. 9. Superfluous pronoun Occasionally a sentence contains a su- perfluous pronoun, a word that con- tributes as much to meaning as a benign tumor to bodily functioning. The first example is from the press. . . . No one foresaw the firestorm of . . . criticism . . . that would descend on Oakland—the last school district left in California where a majority of its students are black. Better: “. . . the last school district . . . where a majority of students are black.” The unneeded word is “its.” It is plain from “the last school district . . . where” that the “students” are its. The chairman of a political party said, when queried about allegedly illegal do- nations: If you’ve done something you can’t do that, I don’t want you part of my responsibility. “That” serves no purpose. (Another fault of the sentence is its apparent il- logic: How can you do something you can’t do? Either change “can’t” to shouldn’t or insert legally before “do.”) 10. Wrong case A. “Me and them”—right or wrong? A teacher competing in a TV quiz contest said, “Me and my kids live in a dormitory . . . .” Can “me and my kids” or “me and them” or “me and him,” or the like, ever be right? The answer is yes, although it was wrong in the example. The contestant chose the wrong case for the pronoun representing himself. It should have been I. Case is the form of a pronoun or noun that expresses the word’s relation to other words in a sentence; mainly it marks the word as a subject or object. The pronoun I in the sentence “I and my kids live in a dormitory” is correct be- cause it is part of the subject; that is, the doer(s) of the action. Hence it is in the subjective case (also called the nominative case). I is strictly subjective, and so are the pronouns we, he, she, they, and who. In the sentence “They evicted me and my kids,” me is correct because it is an object; it (along with my kids ) is the re- ceiver of the action of the verb, evicted. Hence it is in the objective case (also called the accusative case). Me is strictly objective, and so are the pronouns us, him, her, them, and whom. You can be either subjective or objec- tive. (If you think the rules are fussy now, hark back to about 1150 – 1500 . Whereas we have only you for the sec- ond person, speakers of Middle English had the subjective forms thou, singular, and ye, plural; and the objective forms thee, singular, and you, plural. Making it more complicated, during that period the use of the plural ye or you as a polite singular developed; thou or thee became the familiar singular.) Another case is the genitive (or pos- sessive ) expressing the ideas of posses- sion, origin, characteristic, measure, etc.; e.g., George’s shirt, their novels, the voice of the turtledove, a friend of hers. ( See 1, 2, 9; Double possessive; Gerund, 4; Possessive problems; Punctuation, 1. ) Case is used in a wholly different sense in upper case, meaning capital let- ters, and lower case, small letters. The terms come from the cases in which the old-time printers kept their type. B. “And I” or “and ME”? At some time in the dim past, many of us said something like this: “Jimmy and me are going to the park.” A correction followed: “No, no. You should say 316 pronouns 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 316"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"‘Jimmy and I are going.’ ” The lesson must have been incomplete or indi- gested. Its upshot is sentences like these: [From a magazine article:] Being forced to operate “differently” has given Judy and I the privilege of pub- lishing whatever we enjoy reading. [From a situation comedy:] I just know things got better for Jill and I. [By a TV weather man:] This weather comes as a surprise to you and I. In every instance, “I” should be me. No one would have erred if “Judy” / “Jill” / or “you” had been excluded. No one would have said “. . . has given I the privilege . . .” / “. . . things got better for I” / or “. . . comes as a surprise to I.” It would have sounded too bad. The extra person in each sentence seemed to steer each speaker or writer off course. Per- haps the phrase “and I” acted as a false beacon, although the linking of the pro- nouns by or instead of and did not pre- vent a similar error, by the hostess of a radio talk show: There are only about five minutes left for you or I, Robert. Again “I” should be me. Her competitor, a host on another radio station, erred the other way: We have revised the plan, just you and me. It should be “you and I, ” merely rephrasing the subject, “We.” A similar mistake, though a more obvious one, was made on TV by a prominent critic: Halfway into this screenplay even you and me had questions. The objective case includes not only a direct object of a verb, but also: • An indirect object (which tells for whom [or for what ] or to whom [or to what ] the action is done), for instance, “has given Judy and me the privilege.” (Some consider these forms a separate case, the dative. ) • An object, or goal, of a preposition: “for Jill and me ” / “to you and me ” / “for you or me. ” • An object of a verbal: “Jack loves visiting her. ” / “The court trying him has adjourned.” / “The doctors want to test me. ” (Gerunds, participles, and infinitives are verbals. See VERBAL, 3. ) C. “Between HE and . . .” or “between HIM and . . .”? Just as an unmastered grammar lesson of long ago could have led to the “and I” error shown above, it could explain overgrammatical efforts of the “he” or “she” kind. Nobody would be likely to say “I gave he the key” or “They elected she,” instead of him or her respectively. Con- fusion arises with more complicated sen- tences, particularly when the pronoun is linked with someone or something else. Let us quote a television newscast and a newspaper caption. Rose said he was glad that all legal ac- tion between he and the league was over. The legal action was between “ him and the league.” They are objects of the preposition between. The Princess of Wales, with Henry A. Kissinger and Gen. Colin L. Powell, was undeniably the center of attention last night at a reception following an awards dinner honoring she and the retired general. The awards dinner honored “ her and the retired general.” They are objects of the participle honoring. pronouns 317 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 317"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"The newscaster and writer would say, “It’s just between us, ” not “we” / “Stop harassing her, ” not “she” / “Helen works for him, ” not “he” / “Pay them, ” not “they.” The pronoun would have to be in the objective case. That the object has an extra component should not make any difference in the choice of case: “It’s just between us and the league.” / “Crowds kept surrounding her and her family.” / “John gave the packages to him and his wife.” / We pho- tographed them and the neighbors.” D. “It’s I” or “It’s ME”? / “HE” or “HIM”? A traditional rule of grammar decrees that the subject of a linking verb and any pronoun linked with that verb be in the same case. The linking verb (called also a copula ) most often is a form of the verb be, and the problem usually boils down to something like this: Which is right, “The winner was he ” or “The winner was him ”? The traditional answer would be he, on the grounds that the pronoun represents the same entity as the subject. Actually it depends on whether the statement is to be written or spoken. When your friend or relation re- sponds to your knock with “Who’s there?” you will probably not reply, “It is I.” You are more likely to respond, “It’s me”—and so you should. Gram- marians are on your side. A phrase like It wasn’t me being collo- quial, “such a lapse is of no impor- tance,” H. W. Fowler wrote. Sir Ernest Gowers, his reviser, went further: In col- loquialisms like that and It’s me, the use of me is “perhaps the only successful at- tack made by me on I ”; moreover, That’s him has won “the status of idiomatic spoken English.” Wilson Follett wrote that writers and others devoted to sound grammar were “firm in believing that the colloquial It’s me is acceptable in speech and in writing when the tone is not ele- vated.” Such usage is far from new. A ten- dency in popular speech to use the objective case for a pronoun that com- plements a linking verb “has persisted since the sixteenth century,” George O. Curme wrote. He found examples even among “good authors of serious style.” He quoted Churchill: “It is not me he misjudges.” Jonson: “Here be them haue beene amongst souldiers.” Shakespeare: “And damn’d be him that first cries, ‘Hold, enough!’ ” Marlowe was quoted (elsewhere): “Is it him you seek?” and “ ’Tis her I esteem.” Despite literary examples to the con- trary, most authorities advocate follow- ing the rule in formal writing. But Roy H. Copperud says flatly: “The nomina- tive (‘It’s I’) is stilted and thus avoided.” E. “Than I” or “than ME”? A pair of reviewers rejected a movie, although, one of them said on television, “Roger liked it a little more than me.” Literally the remark was tantamount to saying, “Roger liked the movie a little more than he liked me.” That may have been Roger’s sentiment, but more likely the other reviewer was comparing their attitudes toward the movie. Thus he should have said “more than I. ” It would be an elliptical, or shortened, ver- sion of “more than I liked it,” in which I would be the subject of the clause “I liked it.” He would never say “more than me liked it.” Understandably, new- comers to the language sometimes make the mistake of using the objective case as a subject, e.g., “Me Tarzan.” Native speakers of English lack their excuse. The context may have made the meaning clear to all the television watch- ers, but in some similar constructions the wrong choice of case can change the meaning or render it ambiguous. “Do you see Jack more often than I? ” asks whether you see him more often than I do. “Do you see Jack more often than me? ” asks whether you see him more of- ten than you see me. 318 pronouns 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 318"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"The principle is the same in this exam- ple: “Helen loves chocolate as much as he ” means they are equally fond of it. “Helen loves chocolate as much as him ” means her affection is divided. F. “WE people” or “US people”? The preamble to the Constitution starts out, “We the people of the United States. . . .” Perhaps with that phrase in her mind, the wife of a presidential can- didate told a gathering in New Hamp- shire that her husband stood for “more freedom for we the people.” Change “we” to us. An object of the preposition for, the pronoun should be in the objec- tive case. “We the people” is not an im- mutable phrase. In the Constitution we essentially is the subject. The phrase the people of the United States is in apposi- tion to it (that is, explains it). A comma often precedes appositive phrases (“Mr. Wilson, the chairman . . .”) but not nec- essarily. Similarly “we” should have been us when a radio announcer said, advertis- ing a wine, “This name is not too diffi- cult for we Americans to say.” A teacher in North Carolina publicly objected to “pay that is not encouraging to we people who have decided to stay in education.” Again change “we” to us. It is an object of the preposition to. She could have got by with we as the subject of a sentence, like this one: “We people who have decided to stay in education need the encouragement of better pay.” The reverse error used to appear in ads showing a man supposedly saying, “Us ——— smokers would rather fight than switch.” As the subject of the sen- tence, we, not “us,” would be grammati- cal. The advertising agent who wrote the slogan probably knew that. See also WHO and WHOM. Pronouns’ classification. Pronouns are customarily classified in eight cate- gories. ( See Pronouns for an enumera- tion of problems.) 1. Demonstrative pronouns point out. They include this and that, these and those. “This is the forest primeval.” / “These are the times that try men’s souls.” ( See THIS; THESE and THOSE. ) 2. Indefinite pronouns represent no par- ticular person or thing. “ Everybody loves a baby.” / “Take it easy.” / “ One never knows.” Among them are all, another, any, anybody, anyone, any- thing, each, everything, everyone, few, many, most, nobody, no one, none, several, some, somebody, someone, and something. ( See ANY; EACH, EACH OF; EVERY ONE and EV- ERYONE; ONE as pronoun; Pro- nouns, 2C. ) 3. Intensive pronouns end in -self or -selves and give emphasis to personal pronouns. “I built it all myself. ” / “He himself has said it.” ( See Pronouns, 4, 5. ) 4. Interrogative pronouns ask questions. “ What did the president know?” / “ Whose undergarments are these?” Which, who, and whom are others. ( See WHO and WHOM; WHOSE. ) 5. Personal pronouns represent particu- lar persons, sometimes things. “ I now pronounce you husband and wife.” / “ You don’t scare me. ” Personal pronouns change form depending on case (subjective, objec- tive, or possessive); gender (mascu- line, feminine, or neuter); number (singular or plural); and person (first, second, or third). Personal pronouns in the subjective (or nominative) case are I, you, he, she, and it, singular; and we, you, and they, plural. Pronouns in the objective case are me, you, him, her, and it, sin- gular; and us, you, and them, plural. ( See Possessive problems, 4, on the possessive case. See Pronouns, 2, on number; 7 on person; and 10, mainly on the subjective and objective cases.) 6. Reciprocal pronouns show ex- changes. “The three brothers joshed pronouns’ classification 319 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 319"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"one another. ” / “Romeo and Josephine despise each other. ” ( See EACH OTHER. ) 7. Reflexive pronouns bounce the ac- tions taken by subjects back on the subjects. Like intensive pronouns, they end in -self or -selves. “Hortensia hurt herself. ” / “Make yourselves at home.” ( See Pronouns, 3, 4, 5. ) 8. Relative pronouns commonly include that, which, who, whom, and whose. “The creature that lives there is a bandicoot.” / “This cheese, which comes from Belgium, smells delight- ful.” Generally a relative pronoun (a) stands for a particular noun ( creature or cheese ); (b) connects the noun to a dependent clause that modifies it (“ that lives there” or “ which comes from Belgium”); and (c) introduces that dependent clause, serving as the subject of its verb ( lives or comes ). ( See THAT and WHICH; WHO, THAT, and WHICH. ) PROOF and EVIDENCE. See EVI- DENCE and PROOF. PROOF OF THE PUDDING. The proverb about proof and pudding per- plexes people. Some, it seems, would search through the pudding for the proof, however messy it would be to do so. A senator, contrasting the president’s promises and performance, said, “The proof’s in the pudding.” A TV reporter, summarizing a city official’s remarks about proposed transit improvements, said, “The proof will be in the pudding.” No, the proof is not in the pudding. Nor is it in anything as complicated as the following. A chief justice was writing about the problems in drafting a Supreme Court opinion: Here again, we do the best we can, recognizing that the proof of the pud- ding will be the reaction of those who voted with the majority at conference when they see the draft Court opin- ion. “The proof of the pudding is in the eat- ing.” That is all there is to the proverb. Proof means test in that context. A good cook tastes and hence tests his food. See also “ EXCEPTION PROVES THE RULE. ” “PROOF POSITIVE.” English syn- tax calls for the adjective first, noun sec- ond, as in positive proof. Nevertheless, a network anchor man said the Nixon tapes offered “proof positive that he knew there was a widespread criminal conspiracy.” And an article in a health magazine contained this sentence: The fact that Asian populations eat a great deal of soy foods and have lower rates of breast cancer is not proof pos- itive that soy is protective. . . . The reversal may stem from a series of cigarette ads and commercials in the days when they were broadcast. A com- pany claimed to offer “proof positive” of the salutary benefit of its product, thus turning truth as well as syntax topsy-turvy. See also Adjectives and adverbs, 2. PROOFREAD, PROOFREAD- ING. The fact that proofread and proofreading are each spelled in two dif- ferent ways in the excerpts below (from a book that purports to instruct writers in self-publishing) is not the main prob- lem. The author evidently did not know what the terms meant. . . . Rough grammar or duplication of information . . . can be corrected later during the proof reading session. ... . . .

Once you have finished all the proof-reading of this draft copy and made any changes you wish to make, you should retype your draft copy .... Now, finish writing your book and proofread it. . . . A proof is a test print of material that has been set in type and is to be pub- lished. It permits one to correct typo- graphical errors before the material goes to press. To proofread is to check the proof against the manuscript, that is, the pages from the writer and editor, and to make any corrections on the proof. One who works at proofreading is a proof- reader. It is not necessarily wrong to spell each term as a hyphenated word or as two words, provided that the chosen style is used consistently. Proofreading differs from copy- editing (also spelled copy editing and copyediting ), which is done before type is set. To copy-edit (sometimes spelled copyedit ) is to edit copy, that is, any manuscript to be published, making cor- rections or otherwise preparing the copy for typesetting. One who does such edit- ing as a livelihood is a copy editor (some- times spelled as one word). In newspaper offices the task is often called copyread- ing and the editors copyreaders. Those who read copy there also write head- lines. (The sample could have stood some copy-editing. The second paragraph alone has six defects: Change “proof read” to copy-edit or edit; omit “who”; change “will” to should; omit the extra “f” in “affraid”; change “biased” to un- biased; and change “their” to his. ) Proper nouns (names).

We see evidence of that fact constantly in home- made signs, notes, and other writings throughout the country. Even profes- sional writers sometimes misuse this mark, sticking it in where it does not be- long and leaving it out where it does be- long. Notwithstanding all the misuse, the punctuation 321 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 321"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"proper use of the apostrophe is not usu- ally very difficult. The mark has two main purposes: • It indicates possession—for nouns mostly. Usually an apostrophe and s are added to a singular noun or to an irregular plural, e.g., girl’s, Jack’s, men’s. Only an apostrophe, no s, is added to a plural noun that ends in s, e.g., birds’, friends’. ( See also Possessive problems. ) • It takes the place of a missing letter or letters when a word or phrase is shortened in a contraction, e.g., can’t for cannot and that’s for that is. ( See also Contractions. ) B. Common types of confusion It’s, the contraction of it is as in “It’s a boy,” is often mixed up with the posses- sive its as in “The bird has spread its wings.” There tend to be similar mix-ups of who’s, the contraction of who is as in Who’s Who, with whose as in “Whose car is this?”; and you’re, the contraction of you are, as in “You’re welcome,” with your, as in “Bring your lunch.” ( See also ITS and IT’S; Possessive problems, 4; Pronouns, 8; WHOSE, 2; YOUR and YOU’RE. ) Many who understand the possessive function of the apostrophe are uncertain whether to put it before or after the s. This is the procedure: • When a singular noun that does not end in s is made possessive, the apostrophe always goes before the s, never after. An ad for “One of the citys’ 10 best restaurants” misplaced the apostrophe. City’s is the right way. A plural that does not end in s also gets an apostrophe followed by s: “the children’s hour” / “the geese’s wings.” • When a plural noun with an s ending is made possessive, it is followed by an apostrophe and no extra s: “the Twin Cities’ finances” / “the doctors’ offices.” See G for words ending in s, a complicated topic. C. Forgotten apostrophes A national newspaper promised to run, among other information, “Each teams first pick. . . .” Team’s, possessive, needs an apostrophe. Another prominent newspaper later omitted a needed apostrophe from a plu- ral noun in a main headline: CANDIDATES CLASH OVER TRADE ISSUES HEADING INTO VOTE The first word should have been CAN- DIDATES’. Without the apostrophe, “CLASH” is read as a verb—“CANDI- DATES CLASH / OVER TRADE IS- SUES”—and the third line does not make sense. With the apostrophe, “CLASH” would be read as a noun and the third line would be comprehensible. The same publication described the coconut industry of the Philippines as “one of the countries largest.” This time, a plural, “countries,” erroneously re- placed the possessive, country’s. ( See also Ellipsis. ) An apostrophe is omitted also in a book about marketing problems: The firm encountered additional problems in Italy when it tried to in- troduce the ladies electric shaver. Logically it should be “the ladies’ electric shaver.” The masculine equivalent would be the gentlemen’s or men’s (not “gentlemen” or “men”) electric shaver. And one would speak of children’s (not “children”) toys. D. Intrusive apostrophes Some people seem to think that any word ending in s gets an apostrophe. 322 punctuation 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 322"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"Even press professionals, who know bet- ter, sometimes put apostrophes in simple plurals. A headline over a man-in-the-street column asked, “Tell About Parent’s By Their Kids?” and one answer began, “Kid’s are usually a lot different than their parents.” Let “Parent’s” be Parents and let “kid’s” be kids. One could justify leaving a mistake intact in a quotation (“different than” instead of “different from ”) but not adding a mistake. On the next day, an article in the same newspa- per said, “As a matter of public policy, attorney’s have a higher duty to the client’s cause. . . .” A possessive form was erroneously used instead of the plu- ral. Make it attorneys or, better yet, the attorney has. E. Multiple possessives In making two or more words posses- sive, here is a rule of thumb: If there is joint possession, use an apostrophe and s only after the final word: “Black & Decker’s factory” / “Tom and Jerry’s an- tics” / “Peter, Paul, and Mary’s music.” If possession is separate, however, use an apostrophe and s after each word: “Rus- sia’s and China’s representatives” / “men’s and boys’ clothing” / “Carson’s and Leno’s comedy.” F. Possessives of possessives To have consecutive words with the possessive s can be awkward and usually is avoidable. “Jack’s mother’s friend” is better rephrased “a friend of Jack’s mother.” This was in a news story: But Francis ———, president and chief operating officer . . . , filed a re- port with the network’s affiliate’s board president. . . . Either “the network affiliate’s” or “the board president of the network’s affili- ate” would be an improvement. G. Sibilant endings Most words or names ending in s are made possessive by adding an apostro- phe and s: boss’s, James’s, duchess’s, Gladys’s. An older practice was to add only an apostrophe. Some publishers continue that practice, particularly for poetry and multisyllabic words: duchess’, Gladys’. Either way, when the word is read aloud, the s sound is pro- nounced twice. If a final s is silent, most publishers will add s: Arkansas’s, Illi- nois’s. Those who prefer to add s will not usually do so when two s or z sounds precede the apostrophe: princess’, Moses’, Jesus’. Similarly, plural words ending in two s or z sounds get an apos- trophe only: misses’ and dresses’. Excep- tions are made also for some expressions in which the word following the apos- trophe begins with s: for goodness’ sake, for appearance’ sake. When pro- nounced, such an expression usually gets only one hiss. By any standard, an s belonged after the apostrophe here: • 23 percent believed Marx’ phrase, “From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.” It is Marx’s phrase. Although Marx sounds like Mark’s, an x does not replace an s. An apostrophe without an S made no more sense in a leading tabloid’s main headline that screamed about “LIZ’ HUBBY’S DRUG BUST.” LIZ’S would be right. A Z does not replace an S. (From the standpoint of the tabloid, maybe the only S that counts has two lines through it.) H. Special uses The apostrophe is used with s to make plurals of letters, numbers, and symbols: The Oakland A’s; two SOS’s; three B-2’s. Omitting the apostrophe and using just s punctuation 323 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 323"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"in such cases is now preferred by many. When the meaning is unmistakable, as in the 1700s or in her 50s, it is acceptable. But in some cases it can be confusing to omit the apostrophe. For instance, an apostrophe is needed in A’s to keep it from turning into the word As. The plural of a word cited for its grammar, typography, or the like, takes apostrophe -s. For example, “Some writ- ers stint in their and’s. ” If, however, the meaning of the word is important, use only s and no apostrophe: “The policy has too many buts. ” I. The other APOSTROPHE The word apostrophe is used in an- other sense: words addressed poetically to a person, thing, or deity as a digres- sion in a speech or literary piece. See 6. 2. Colon A. Functions: mechanical and optional Essentially, the colon (:) gives notice to the reader to expect something. It has both cut-and-dried uses and optional uses. In the first category, it follows a for- mal salutation in a letter ( Dear Sir: ); it punctuates clock times and racing speeds ( 8:30 p.m. and 3:59 ); it divides a main ti- tle and a subtitle in a reference to a book or other work ( Words: The New Dictio- nary ); and it introduces quotations, espe- cially those that are relatively long (as shown throughout this book), and lists (as illustrated below). Combine in a skillet: 1 ⁄ 4 cup olive oil 1 tablespoon curry powder 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 1 ⁄ 8 teaspoon cayenne If the victim is conscious while you wait for help to arrive: a. Keep the victim warm . . . and ly- ing down. b. Give the victim nothing to drink or eat. . . . In the second category, the colon can put the reader on notice that an elabora- tion or explanation is coming (as in sub- heading A ); or it can separate a set of one-two punches: When a statement consists of two parts, and the first leads to the second, a colon may well separate the two. In that function it substitutes for e.g., i.e., or viz. or the equivalent, for example, that is, or namely respectively. (Incidentally, the letters stand for the Latin words exempli gratia, for the sake of example; id est, that is [to say]; and videlicet, to see is permitted.) The two examples below, both proper, come from a book on economics. (In the first, the colon separates an inde- pendent clause and a phrase. In the second, the colon separates two indepen- dent clauses.) In addition, our economy provides a much more powerful antidote to the rule of the rich: the economies of scale. Here we have a dilemma: we must choose between pleasure at some sac- rifice of comfort and more complete comfort at the sacrifice of pleasure. In the latter example, the two clauses could be two wholly separate sentences, but the colon clearly relates the first to the second. Views differ on whether or not the second statement should start with a capital letter if it amounts to a complete sentence. It is a matter of style. The lower-case “we” is valid, though the book you are reading would use We. (So would The Associated Press and The New York Times. The Chicago Manual of Style would allow the “we.” But it fol- lows a colon with a capital letter when the colon introduces more than one sen- tence, a formal statement, a quotation, or a speech in dialogue.) B. Interrupted sentences Unless a sentence is meant to be inter- rupted, a colon should not separate a 324 punctuation 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 324"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"verb from its object or complement. A newsletter and a newspaper do interrupt their sentences: We’re pleased to welcome: Lynn B . . . Margaret H . . . Vivian K [etc.]. . . . The nine inductees are: Donald B . . . Maurice C . . . Dick M [etc.]. . . . A writer probably would not insert the colon if only one name followed. “We’re pleased to welcome: Mary Richards.” / “The inductee is: John Tyler.” / “They call me: Mimi.” The additional names should not matter. An interruption may be appropriate if the ensuing enumeration or quotation is long or formal; if it goes in a separate paragraph or paragraphs; or if the intro- duction heralds the approach of the ma- terial. “The president’s four main points are the following:” / “The text of the an- them goes as follows:” / “The ten lead- ing companies in the field are these:” / “The pope’s full statement said:” C. Verbless writing The use of sentence fragments in which colons take the places of verbs is a technique associated with journalism, particularly news magazines. One of them ran this paragraph: Year Edison and his aide invented the Kinetoscope: 1889 ; reason Edison was slow to develop the technology: He thought interest in movies would quickly fade; year he began marketing his own projector: 1896 It takes the same number of words to convey the same message in complete sentences: Edison and his aide invented the Kine- toscope in 1889 . Edison was slow to develop the technology because he thought interest in movies would quickly fade. He began marketing his own projector in 1896 . Using colons instead of verbs is not necessarily wrong, but it can be over- done. The device appears in three succes- sive paragraphs of a Sunday magazine section. Are and is are the words that have been replaced by colons. The villains: The out-of-towners, a Newport Beach suburban office devel- oper .... The victim: Robert D . . . sailor and idea man who three years ago. . . . And the mystery man: Arthur C . . . physician and swing vote on this question. . . . Some 110 words go by with three sub- jects and no predicates. The style is ques- tionable. (So is the capitalized “T” in the second “The,” inasmuch as only a frag- ment of a sentence follows the colon.) 3. Comma A. Department of commas The comma (,) provides a bit of sepa- ration or a brief pause. Some uses are mechanical: “New York, NY” / “July 4 , 1776 ” / “$ 4 , 507 , 000 .” Many uses are discretionary, helping to make sentences clear. The modern trend is to use fewer commas. In 1789 this was high style; the commas would not have been used to- day: “The enumeration in the Constitu- tion, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others re- tained by the people.” But in modern times an abundance of writing without needed commas suggests that the trend may be going too far. Commas can be indispensable for clarity. Take this sentence: “Jack, said Sam, took the money.” Removing the commas changes the meaning com- punctuation 325 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 325"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"pletely: “Jack said Sam took the money.” And “Fruit, trees, and flowers” are not the same as “fruit trees and flowers.” And it might be confusing to read this one without commas: “According to my brother, George, Washington apples are best.” Commas have many functions. They set off attributions, definitions, explana- tions, elaborations, and identifications. They divide three or more items in a se- ries. ( See Series errors, 7. ) Often they separate phrases. And they indicate pauses in thought. Their function of setting off part of a sentence resembles that of dashes and parentheses. ( See 4, 7. ) In general, com- mas least interrupt the flow of the sen- tence. When the set-off matter comes amid a sentence, as in this very sentence, a pair of commas is needed. “They moved to Charleston, West Virginia, last month.” / “At last, men felt, the ranks of diplo- macy were broken. . . .” The second comma of such a pair should not be overlooked. Sometimes it is overlooked, particularly in attributions: “Soon after midnight, police said the blast took place.” If that was when it happened, not when they said it, commas are needed both before and after “police said.” A comma or pair of commas sets off a which clause or a nonrestrictive who clause. “Sam’s Restaurant, which was my favorite, has gone out of business.” / “Do you know Edith Bunker, who used to work here?” ( See THAT and WHICH, 1; WHO, THAT, and WHICH, 2. ) A comma or pair of com- mas can indicate whether a category has only one member or more than one member: “I’m taking my daughter, Matilda” implies that I have just one daughter; the name is incidental to the main message. “I’m taking my daughter Matilda” implies that I have more than one daughter; the name is an integral part of the message. When a subordinate clause opens a sentence, a comma normally follows: “If you have a loss, check the box that de- scribes your investment.” Many phrases are treated similarly: “Having delivered this blow, he departed on the pacific cru- sade. . . .” Commas separate many other clauses or other parts of sentences, par- ticularly when they diverge in meaning: “He has eyes, yet he cannot see.” / “Make love, not war.” When a series of adjectives modify the same noun, commas may or may not fol- low them. They do if each adjective has an equal effect on the noun, as in “the dark, threatening sky” or “a soft, sweet, juicy fruit.” The test is whether and can sensibly go between each adjective; if so, a comma can. One can say, for instance, “the dark and threatening sky.” But in “a gray alley cat” or “a pleasant mas- querade party” the adjectives are un- equal; and or a comma would not go between them. The first adjective (“gray”) modifies the second adjective combined with the noun (“alley cat”), two words that function together as a noun. When used in place of a colon or dash, a comma can be misunderstood: “He received a dollar, a half and two quarters.” The total he received could have been either $ 1 or $ 2 . If “dollar” is a total and not just an item in a series, a comma is not the right mark to set it off. Commas in place of semicolons can be misunderstood too: “We met Harris, the chairman, the treasurer, and the secre- tary.” How many did we meet? If three, change the second and third commas to semicolons. A comma does not belong between two independent clauses; that is, what could be two complete sentences: “I haven’t heard any objections, nobody here has complained.” The comma does not do an adequate job of either separat- ing the clauses or uniting them in that published example of what is called a comma fault or a comma splice. A pe- 326 punctuation 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 326"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"riod (followed by a capital N ) would separate them into two sentences. A semicolon or a colon would properly unite them. (So would a conjunction, and, but the passage is quoting some- one.) See also 2, 8, 11; Run-on sentence, 2. B. Missing commas: ambiguity The lack of a comma sometimes dis- torts the meaning of a sentence. When the comma’s job of separation is not per- formed, separate thoughts may appear to be one thought. An epilogue is summing up the main themes of a book: “In the third essay on mapping the world, another theme en- ters.” It seems to imply that three essays on mapping the world have been pre- sented. Actually the third essay is the only one on that subject. There needs to be a comma after “In the third essay,” indicating that “on mapping the world” is separate information and not part of the first phrase. In each of the two press quotations below, the absence of a comma restricts the meaning. The result probably was not intended by the writer. House Democrats who’ve pushed through $ 93 . 6 billion in income tax hikes vowed to fight for some of those provisions over the weekend. Did only those House Democrats who did the pushing do the vowing? That is what the sentence suggests now. If the writer regards all the House Democrats as a unit, the sentence needs a pair of commas: “House Democrats, who’ve pushed through $ 93 . 6 billion in income tax hikes, vowed to fight. . . .” (The “who’ve” instead of who have is ques- tionable too. See Contractions. ) Some plasma cells join to cancer cells forming hybrid cells able to reproduce indefinitely. If the plasma cells and not just the cancer cells are “forming hybrid cells,” insert a comma after “cancer cells.” The lack of a comma can result in am- biguity when words meant to be sepa- rate form unexpected units. Four days into the hearing the real estate agent and co-defendants reached an out-of-court settlement with buyers paying an undisclosed sum and taking back the house. Who paid the sum and took back the house? “. . . Buyers paying” suggests that it was they. But if the writer ne- glected to put a comma after “buyers,” it was the other parties that acted. From the context, the latter seems to be so. The defendants reached a “settle- ment with buyers, paying an undisclosed sum. . . .” C. Missing commas: pauses skipped Hundreds of uses of the comma can be summarized this way: It indicates a slight pause. It tells the reader, whether reading silently or aloud, to hesitate or slow down a trifle. Thus it helps commu- nicate the writer’s meaning. Let us list a few of the normal points of pause. The illustrative sentences, from books and newspapers, lack commas and are fol- lowed by corrections. • After an initial phrase that is absolute or contrasting: . . . Neither of us being expert we were well splattered. Somewhat cruel and ambitious he was nevertheless a strong leader .... Commas after “expert” and “ambi- tious” would be desirable. • Where the main thought meets a participial phrase: punctuation 327 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 327"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"[A critic] reproached Beethoven . . . for the absence of a great vocal fugue considered traditional. . . . . . . The Postal Service still turns a slight profit making daily deliveries. . . . ...I hauled on my paddle and the in- fant did his part back paddling with a broken blade. Put a comma after “fugue,” after “profit,” and after “part” (and hyphen- ate “back paddling”). A comma in the second sentence would have avoided the false phrase “profit making.” • Before a phrase of negation or contradiction: . . . Scarce resources . . . are rationed not by price . . . but by [corrupt] offi- cials. . . . . . . This is only bad prose not bad pollution. Insert commas after “rationed” and “prose.” • After a phrase ending in a negative. Adding to the new government’s problems is the confusion about what is state property and what is not fol- lowing 10 years of secretive Sandin- ista rule. A comma after “not” would keep it from fusing with the next word. • Where the scene abruptly shifts, often just before then: He was suspended for 30 days with- out pay then dismissed after he re- quested a transfer. A comma should follow “pay.” And note this pair of sentences: Some researchers believe a baby forms concepts about the world and then matches the words it hears to those concepts. Others think a baby hears the words first then matches concepts to those words. The latter sentence needs a comma be- fore “then”; the former does not, be- cause a conjunction, “and,” bridges the gap. • Before and often after a parenthetical identification, explanation, or appellation. “Don’t be scared baby.” . . . Payne, a legal consultant for Risk Management said . . . the state could reduce the need to pay for judg- ments. . . . Put a comma after “scared,” just as you would put one in “Won’t you come home, Bill Bailey?” One comma is enough when the set-off matter ends a sentence; otherwise a pair of commas is necessary, just as a pair of parentheses is. The latter sentence lacks the second comma of the pair, after “Manage- ment.” D. Needless commas Unnecessary commas occasionally produce as much confusion as the ab- sence of necessary commas can. The commas do so by isolating words or phrases that should not be isolated. This example is from a column: Although they produced solid evi- dence that some Temple members, and others who lived outside the city, had voted, it was never proved that their votes made a difference in the outcome. Two commas set aside “and others who lived outside the city,” tending to distin- 328 punctuation 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 328"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"guish that group from the Temple mem- bers. If both groups were outsiders, clar- ity requires removing those commas. (A better treatment would be rewriting. “Although they produced solid evidence that people who lived outside the city, both Temple members and others, had voted. . . .”) Unnecessary commas can make a por- tion of a sentence appear to be unessen- tial when it is really essential. A noted book on language says: Two years earlier the Scottish physi- cian, Alexander Hamilton, traveling along the Hudson, found an immense number of colonels. The comma after “the Scottish physi- cian” makes the ensuing name seem just an elaboration, unessential to the previ- ous phrase. The implication is that Scot- land had only one physician. Removing the comma distinguishes the Scottish physician Alexander Hamilton from all the other Scottish physicians. (But see THE, 2A, end.) A comma generally should not be placed between a subject and its verb. Delete the commas in the two press sen- tences: . . . The seller’s only obligation with- out a written warranty, is to sell you a car that is capable of providing basic transportation. . . . . . . The established way to prove a statistically significant improved sur- vival rate in the patients who have taken the drug, is for a certain number in the control group to die. To place a comma immediately after is in either of those sentences (and thereby separate the auxiliary verb from the rest of the verb phrase) would also be a mis- take, yet some make such a mistake. See Verbosity (artist) for an example. Nor should a comma follow the sub- ject of an absolute construction. “Man- goes, being cheap, I bought a bunch of them.” Delete the first comma. See Mod- ifiers, 1D. Normally two items in a series of two in a simple sentence need not be sepa- rated by a comma. ( See Series errors, 8, for the rules in longer series.) Delete the commas in these two samples, from news stories: Police said the dead were four con- struction workers, and the driver of the school van. Hungarians were denied jobs, and ar- rested in inordinate numbers. Those commas are just unnecessary, slightly impeding communication. Occa- sionally such a use can mislead. A memo says, “Joe: Tell Fred to draw up the con- tract, and see me in my office.” If Fred is the one to visit the office, the comma is unwanted; it seems to herald an indepen- dent clause, in which “see me” is an or- der to Joe. A more complicated version of that problem comes from a magazine article, which advises parents: . . . Insist that your child never give out personal information—home ad- dress, phone number, school name— on-line without first asking your permission, and never agree to meet someone in person without a parent being present. At first, the comma may seem to divide the sentence into two independent clauses, in which you, the parent, are told to ( 1 ) “insist that . . .” and ( 2 ) “never agree to. . . .” Actually, “never agree” is not an imperative but a present subjunctive; it is subordinate to “insist that your child,” just as “never give out” is. Readers can figure out the meaning, but the comma is momentarily mislead- ing. (For emphasis and clarity, the main punctuation 329 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 329"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"points could be numbered or even given their own paragraphs.) E. Too few and too many Missing and needless commas are not mutually exclusive. Each of the follow- ing passages (from three newspapers and a book) calls for a comma or two while containing an uncalled-for comma. Sometimes, the snow swirls low across the road drifting in from the forests. The world is pine and white prairie, entirely. A comma is lacking after “road,” if it is the snow that drifts in and not the road. The commas after “Sometimes” and “prairie” are unnecessary. The Senate passed the bill, but later passed another version requiring that fewer palladium coins be minted. That one lacks a comma after “version,” preceding a separate thought. The comma after “bill” tends to isolate the subject, “The Senate,” from the second verb, “passed.” ( See also Pronouns, 6. ) The former self-proclaimed em- peror, who ruled this landlocked dia- mond-rich black African state from 1966 – 79 , returned home unexpect- edly, in October 1986 .... In stringing together a series of four ad- jectives without a comma, did the writer intend to restrict the sentence so much (distinguishing this state only from non- landlocked diamond-rich black African states)? If not, commas are lacking. A reasonable punctuation gives us “. . . landlocked, diamond-rich, black African state . . .” (treating three adjec- tives equally but “African state” as a unit). While withholding commas from the adjectives, the writer used an unnec- essary comma after “unexpectedly.” (And “from 1966 – 79 ” is a faulty mix- ture. See 4C. ) I have almost total recall, every face is there, every hill and tree and color, and sound of speech and small scenes ready to replay themselves in my memory. A comma fault follows “recall.” ( See 3A, end.) The third comma would be better after “scenes.” (And scene and itself [in lieu of “themselves”] would agree with “every . . . is . . . every.”) 4. Dash and hyphen A. The difference The public often confuses the dash (—) and the hyphen (-). Occasionally the press mixes them up too. Both punctua- tion marks are horizontal lines, but a hy- phen is very short; a dash is longer. When a typewriter or word processor is used, one stroke of the key to the right of the zero (unshifted) makes a hyphen. Two strokes of that key make what rep- resents a dash. They have largely opposite functions. A dash separates words. A hyphen unites words, although it may separate sylla- bles of a word. In the sentence below, from the press, dashes would have been appropriate. In- stead, hyphens were used by mistake. The Egyptian army has been trying hard-albeit unsuccessfully-to prevent PLO terror squads from crossing the Sinai into Israel. Hyphens are found in words like hard- boiled and lean-to. The hyphens in the sample sentence unite words that should have been separated and create the mon- strosities “hard-albeit” and “unsuccess- fully-to.” It makes more sense this way: The Egyptian army has been trying hard—albeit unsuccessfully—to pre- 330 punctuation 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 330"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"vent PLO terror squads from crossing the Sinai into Israel. The phrase “albeit unsuccessfully” is a thought within a thought. The two dashes set off that phrase. Dashes resemble commas (,) and parentheses ( ) insofar as they all set off words and phrases. Dashes tend to give them prominence, however, whereas commas often play them down and parentheses play them down further. Parentheses always come in pairs, whereas a comma or dash may be used singly when the set-off material ends a sentence. A dash or a pair of dashes may set off an explanation or expansion of the pre- ceding thought: “. . . T chaikovsky omit- ted the bass instruments—cellos, double basses, trombones, tuba—as well as trumpets.” / “The Gothic—early, mid- dle, and late—extended over cen- turies. . . .” Or it may set off a contrast or contradiction: “People wanted to laugh, and weep—and could do nei- ther.” Or a summary of a series: “Rare, medium, or well done—these are such personal preferences. . . .” And dashes may serve mechanically in lists: Originally, the four main castes seem to have been: The Brahmins—the priests and teachers; The Kshatriyas—the warriors; The Vaisyas—herdsmen, money- lenders. . . . Hyphens, besides uniting certain words (e.g., left-handed, five-and-ten, Spanish-American War ), mark the divi- sion of words between lines ( see E ), indi- cate combining forms ( -ing, anti- ), simulate stuttering or halting (“K-K-K- Katie”), and suggest the spelling of words letter by letter (“M-i-c-k-e-y”). When two hyphenated compounds are used together, a hyphen suspends part of the first compound (“ one- and five- dollar bills ”). B. Problems with dashes Sometimes a writer squeezes too much stuff between a pair of dashes, and it may not even be pertinent to the rest of the sentence. Writers at times treat dashes as handy devices to dispose of facts that they don’t otherwise know what to do with. In the following sentence, from a newspaper, the use of dashes is not wrong per se, but the twenty-nine-word clause flanked by the two dashes awk- wardly separates the subject (“dinner”) from its verb (“was described”). Dinner—where they were joined by Mr. Marvelashvili; Georgi Gordodze, who heads the board of the Ministry of Trade in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi; an interpreter and two Ameri- cans—was described to the visitors as a “typical Russian dinner,” complete with folk music and dancing. It would be better to dispense with the dashes and place the information now jammed between them in a second sen- tence: “They were joined by ....” In the excerpt below, from a law book, the material sandwiched between the dashes below is even longer, fifty- four words. It adds a confusing element: separate sentences within a sentence. There have been at least five other perplexing constitutional questions— Who can start a war? When is a war “over,” and who is to end it? What are the war powers of Congress, and to what extent may they be delegated to the President? How independent of the Supreme Court are courts-martial and presidential military commis- sions? What are the President’s pow- ers in conquered areas?—that the Court has been begged to answer with some show of finality. punctuation 331 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 331"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"The first ten words, “There have been at least five other perplexing constitutional questions,” appear to complete a thought. So after five complete sentences go by, the reader is utterly unprepared for the tail end: “that the Court has been begged to answer.” The divided sentence should first be connected, then the five questions introduced. You cannot keep a sentence going if another sentence stops it. To avoid confusion, no more than one single dash or one pair of dashes should be used in a sentence (except for special purposes; see C ). Dashes, like other forms of punctuation, should help to bring out meaning; the four dashes in the passage below do more to obscure it. The Republican Party was created out of the remnants of the old Whig Party and the dissenters from the Democratic Party who called them- selves Independent Democrats. It was the first party which, for half a century, proclaimed—and cam- paigned on—a body of “principles,” and its victory in 1860 marked it as the first—and the last—new party which has won a presidential election. The second sentence would benefit by (among other things) a slicing into two or more sentences and an isolation of each main point; specifically, the firsts should not be confused with the later history. A possible revision: The Republican Party was the first party to proclaim and campaign on a body of “principles”—which it did for half a century. Its victory in 1860 marked it also as the first new party to win a presidential election—and it has been the last new party to do so. “The dash,” as a professor of mine used to say, “is a dashing form of punc- tuation.” Overused, as it is by some writers, it is like too much of any good thing. A dash may adjoin the words it sepa- rates—in this manner. But some publica- tions, especially newspapers, will sandwich a dash between two small spaces — thus. A hyphen never needs space around it. Often someone will type a hyphen with space to the left and right, in the mis- taken notion that to do so makes the hy- phen a dash. Such an error was made in a newspaper and a magazine: The couple got $ 17 , 000 for the bungalow - $ 20 , 000 more than the asking price. . . . Hassam began . . . among his most important late works - a unique series of powerful, patriotic images. . . . Hassam created around 30 flag paintings in prints, oils, and watercol- ors - all set in mid Manhattan .... Corrections: “. . . bungalow—$ 20 , 000 . . .” / “ . . . late works—a unique series . . .” / “. . . watercolors—all set. . . .” Elsewhere a peculiar headline looked like this: Rosh Hashana- the Jewish New Year is a time for new beginnings The hyphen (peculiarly adjoining a word to the left and a space to the right) needs to be a dash. But one dash is not enough to set off a thought amid a sentence. It should be Rosh Hashana—the Jewish New Year—is. . . . The usual computer keyboard has ev- ery important punctuation mark except a dash. Some programs enable the user to evoke a dash by means of a special code. Otherwise it is necessary to type two successive hyphens to simulate a dash, the way one does it on a type- writer. 332 punctuation 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 332"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"C. Types of dashes Compositors and printers have tradi- tionally had a variety of dashes besides the ordinary dash, or em dash (—), dis- cussed above. The two-em dash is used to indicate missing or omitted letters: “She blurted out, ‘Oh s——!’ ” It may also suggest unfinished sentences or conspicuous pauses: Mr. Dawson: You’re referring there to the backgrounders that Poindexter and Regan have in advance of the November 18 —— Mr. McFarlane: I believe that’s right. “Does——the one——that wins ——get the crown?” she asked, as well as she could, for the run was putting her quite out of breath. The three-em dash indicates absent words: “Police said ——— and ——— built the bombs. . . .” In a bibliography it means the author is the same as in the preceding paragraph. The shortest dash, shorter than the em dash, is the en dash, used between dates, times, and page numbers. For example, “ 1914 – 17 ” stands for “from 1914 to 1917 (inclusive).” The shortened form is mainly suitable for lists, tables, notes, and parenthetical mentions. A mistake associated with it is illustrated by these two excerpts from articles: In six decades, Horowitz had four periods when he gave up public con- certs: from 1935 - 38 , 1953 - 65 , 1969 - 72 and 1983 - 85 . Wyman and the former president were married from 1940 - 48 . The mistake of both sentences is not the use of the hyphen, a common substitute when the en dash is not available. It is that “from” does not go with the short- ened form, in which “from . . . to . . .” is implied. Anyway, the latter sentence is better expressed fully: “from 1940 to 1948. ” The en dash has another, subtle func- tion. It is used in a compound adjective (that is, an adjective made up of multiple words) in which at least one element consists of two or more words or a hy- phenated word. Examples: “He grew up in the post–World War I era.” / “She de- scribed her half-Hawaiian–half- Caucasian background.” Contemporary writers do not usually follow a dash with a comma. This shows an exception: “ ‘But——,’ he started to say. . . .” (To follow a dash with what- ever punctuation would be there in the absence of a dash is an older style, fa- vored by H. W. Fowler. An example: “If I have caused a problem—and I may have—, I am sorry.”) D. Problems with hyphens Hyphenation has some rules, al- though many exceptions exist. In case of doubt, consult a general dictionary. Bet- ter yet, consult two; dictionaries do not always agree. One says vice-president and co-worker while another says vice president and coworker. When that hap- pens, you take your choice. “. . . A German-born immigrant . . . built the 14 -room mansion.” The sen- tence illustrates a correct use of the hy- phen: to join the components of a compound adjective. It appeared in a New Mexico newspaper. Note that the phrase New Mexico does not get a hy- phen, because it is an established unit as two words. Some compound expressions are established in hyphenated form. Ex- amples are cold-blooded, law-abiding, one-horse (town), and ten-gallon (hat). Such expressions may have multiple hy- phens: out-and-out, dyed-in-the-wool, will-o’-the-wisp. A phrase may or not be hyphenated, depending on its position in a sentence. punctuation 333 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 333"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"“It was a head-on collision” but “The collision was head on. ” / “I like small- town life” but “I like life in a small town. ” / “The state set a 55-mile-an- hour limit” but “The state set a limit of 55 miles an hour. ” / “Why is an upside- down car in the street?” but “Why is a car upside down in the street?” Hyphen- ated before the noun, the same phrase gets no hyphen after the noun. Hyphens are never affixed to adverbs ending in -ly, regardless of position. Thus “The happily married couple possessed a closely guarded secret.” Adjectives com- bined with participles are hyphenated— “a funny-faced comedian” / “the shy-looking girl.” That is so even for ad- jectives that end in -ly: “that heavenly- sounding music” / “a costly- looking car.” While -ly adverbs derive from ad- jectives ( happy, close ), -ly adjectives de- rive from nouns ( heaven, cost ). Certain prefixes normally adjoin hy- phens, in compounds such as all- powerful, ex- mayor, great- grandson, no- fault, post- bellum, and self- made. Suffixes that adjoin hyphens appear, for example, in president -elect, mother -in- law, thirty -odd, and show -off. A hyphen is essential in re-form, meaning to form again, to distinguish it from reform, meaning to correct defects. Similarly, a hyphen distinguishes re-creation, to create again, from recreation, playing. While not essential, a hyphen is useful in a word like co-operate or de- emphasize or anti-intellectual and is pre- ferred by a number of publications and writers. It keeps the two like vowels from appearing to fuse into oo or ee or ii. Typically a publication nowadays closes up a word like antiterrorist or progovernment but hyphenates, say, anti-European or pro-American to sepa- rate the lower-case prefix and the capi- talized name. Some writers prefer to hyphenate both forms. They are not wrong, just using an older style. A person who is a secretary-treasurer performs two roles, united by a hyphen; but secretary general, which amounts to general secretary, is a single role. A con- struction such as “vice president-general manager” is confusing; replace the hy- phen with and. In the phrase “Japanese American sol- diers of the 442 nd and the 100 th” (from an article) a hyphen is missing: it is Japanese-American. A combination of ethnic labels, used as either an adjective or a noun, normally calls for a hyphen (although sometimes an exception is made for French Canadian as a noun). Meaning can depend on a hyphen. A chance to make a sizable profit may be a big business opportunity, whereas a chance to deal with large corporations may be a big-business opportunity. A beneficial activity by the federal govern- ment may be a good government pro- gram, whereas an organization’s plan to reform official abuses may be a good- government program. The hyphens in many compound ad- jectives, such as man-eating, are neces- sary to prevent ambiguity or, at least, absurdity. A newspaper that resisted the use of hyphens ran a headline that said, “Man eating piranha sold as pet fish.” It prompted The New Yorker to ask, “Did he look like a fish?” Similarly, two words need to be joined by a hyphen in each of the two examples that follow, from a newspaper and an encyclopedia. David was born without any infection fighting blood cells and is suffering from Severe Combined Immunity De- ficiency. To avoid suggesting that an infection should be fighting blood cells, hyphenate “infection” and “fighting.” The sentence will read: “David was born without any infection-fighting blood cells. . . .” The order contains two families; the small rodent like pikas . . . ; and the rabbits and hares. 334 punctuation 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 334"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"Is “the small rodent” one of the families and “pikas” an example of that family? No, “pikas” is the family, but someone neglected to make that fact clear by plac- ing a hyphen between “rodent” and “like.” A correction: “the small, rodent- like pikas. . . .” (The comma clarifies that small and rodent-like equally mod- ify pikas. See 3A. ) Half a loaf may be worse than none when it comes to hyphens. A newspaper reported that the secretary of state, visit- ing Bolivia, had condemned what he re- garded as “anti-civilized society.” The target of his rebuke was not a society that was anti-civilized but an action that defied civilized society: a bombing. Therefore the phrase needed a second hyphen: “anti-civilized-society.” Using a hyphen or hyphens is not the way to join phrases. A news story re- ferred, twice, to “the Christian Demo- cratic-Free Democratic” coalition running West Berlin. The writer did not intend to suggest that the coalition was free of democracy, but the hyphen tended to do so by joining the words “Democratic” and “Free.” Extra hy- phens would not help here. An en dash in place of the hyphen would clarify the names of the two parties, although a bet- ter solution would be to recast the phrase, perhaps in this manner: “the coalition of the Christian Democrats and the Free Democrats.” The press sometimes is inconsistent in its use or nonuse of hyphens, as in this example: The Travelodge, near the Dallas Market Center, began its 24 -hour flexible check-in and checkout at the beginning of the year after a three- month test. Inasmuch as check-in has a hyphen, it is hard to justify the omission of the hy- phen in its parallel, check-out. ( See also CHECK OUT and CHECK-OUT. ) So much for the omission of necessary hyphens. Writers are known to insert them unnecessarily too. In an article about educational de- cline, two writers decried “a seeming re- luctance by educators to tackle the problems head-on.” It should be head on (an adverb, modifying the verb tackle ). Compare it with “The cars were in a head-on collision.” (Here head-on is an adjective, modifying the noun collision. ) Hyphens are unnecessarily stuck into two-word verbs in the two press exam- ples that follow. They almost never picked-up the phone to tell a supervisor’s office what they thought about a law .... The writer of that sentence had never picked up the correct verb. The related noun is pickup. Neither has a hyphen. ( See also PICK UP and PICKUP. ) Voters . . . turned-down the idea of demolishing the freeway .... It should be turned down, with no hy- phen. A book describes someone as a soft-spoken man who did not mince his words and could put them on pa- per in a literate, easy-to-read-and- digest style. Soft-spoken is correct. The problem lies in the five-word compound, which is properly punctuated but awkward. All that information does not have to pre- cede style; an alternative: “a literate style that was easy to read and digest.” E. Use of hyphens to divide words The most common use of the hyphen is to indicate the division of a word be- tween two lines in printed material. A word of two or more syllables that is too long to fit on a line is apt to be di- vided. The line ends with a syllable and hyphen together ( sam- ). The line below punctuation 335 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 335"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"begins with the next syllable ( ple ). See Division of words. 5. Ellipsis A. Its legitimate use The function of the three dots known as an ellipsis or ellipsis points ( . . . ) is to show that a writer has left something out of a quotation. As an example, here is an unabridged quotation from a governmental report: “Despite disagreement—both within the Administration and with the Congress— the policy continued apace.” Now here is an abridged version: “Despite dis- agreement . . . the policy continued apace.” The three dots indicate an omis- sion of words from the original sentence. What if your sentence ends with such an omission? It is a common procedure (followed by this book) to add a fourth dot, a period, to mark the end of the sen- tence. “We hold these truths to be self- evident, that all men are created equal. . . .” The dot following the last word is the period. An alternative, when an ellipsis comes at the end of your sentence, is to use just the three dots and no period: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal . . .” Several authorities in the four-point school present optional refinements. They call for just the three dots if your sentence ends with a quotation that is grammatically incomplete. Amendment IV: “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures . . .” A further refinement prescribes a period if your own words blend with the quoted fragment to make a grammatically com- plete sentence. The Fourth Amendment protects “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures. . . .” It can be perplexing at times to pursue those distinctions. Whether it is worth the effort is up to you. Other authorities call for a period at the end of your sentence, full sentence or not. “The only thing we have to fear ....” If you are quoting multiple sentences, the ellipsis can mark an omission of any intervening matter, whether phrases, sen- tences, or paragraphs. Each of the first two ellipses below represents the omis- sion of whole sentences (from a passage in Hamlet ); the third ellipsis represents the omission of the latter part of a sen- tence. Be thou familiar, but by no means vul- gar.... Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice. . . . Neither a borrower nor a lender be. . . . An ellipsis may open a sentence, indi- cating that some preceding matter ap- peared in the original sentence: “. . . Government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from the earth,” said Lin- coln. Here is that quotation preceded by an at- tribution. Some authorities would omit the ellipsis. (A colon may be used instead of a comma for more formality.) Lincoln said, “. . . Government of the people” [etc.]. What precedes the quotation, notably that, may make the ellipsis unnecessary by blending with the quotation: 336 punctuation 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 336"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"Lincoln said that “government of the people” [etc.]. Any other punctuation found in the original quotation may be placed before or after the ellipsis. “Was this the face . . . ?” A period would be excessive in addition to the question mark. An- other example is the following verbatim excerpt from an official report; the colon and dash are unnecessary, though not wrong. (The ellipsis is in the report.) “At this meeting, Mr. McFarlane, as instructed by the President, stated that: . . . —the U.S. could under no circumstances transfer arms to Iran in exchange for hostages.” Any number of dots other than three or four, such as . . (used by the Oxford English Dictionary ) or . . . . . , is non- standard, except that in poetry the omis- sion of any lines of verse is indicated by a line of dots, about the length of a printed line of verse. An ellipsis should not be broken at the end of a line of type, although an ellipsis may be separated from a period. Some printing fonts and computer fonts have ellipses as units. In printing, small spaces may separate the dots, or asterisks, from the words or any adjoining punctuation or each other. Occasionally three asterisks are used, rather than three dots. Again from the report (ellipses unchanged): “I think it was * * * the 18 th * * * ” Asterisks go above the line, dots on the line. A very short quotation that is obvi- ously incomplete needs no ellipsis: Washington warned his countrymen against “permanent alliances.” The word ellipsis is also used in a gen- eral sense to mean the omission of words that would be part of a fully expressed sentence but that are not essential to un- derstanding. An example is if necessary instead of if it is necessary. That topic is covered under Ellipsis. B. Varieties of abuse Ellipses are abused in a variety of ways. The examples presented here ap- peared in print with the ellipses that are shown. A feature article quotes a foreign offi- cial. He was asked to provide a picture of his flag so that it could be copied and displayed: “Well . . . I’m not sure I can do that, but we bring Byelorussian constitu- tion. Flag described there!” Seeing the ellipsis in that quotation, we assume that something has been omit- ted. Has it? Later in the article, a sen- tence that is not a quotation starts out the same way: Well . . . it was just a thought. Too many writers use the ellipsis thoughtlessly as all-purpose punctua- tion. In the two sample sentences above, it replaces what should be a comma (,). In the one below, it replaces what should be a comma or dash (—). Decisively, Mr. Bush said he sup- ported it . . . with reservations. Here the ellipsis usurps the function of a dash (—): Binoculars, camera, compass and map, field guides to flora and fauna, pedometer, walking stick, telescoping fishing rod, portable games . . . all these things can make your outing more enjoyable. One writer seems to think that the purpose of an ellipsis is emphasis. The dots bog down his sentence. punctuation 337 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 337"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"But here in a glass-fronted grotto off Columbus Avenue, the damned ig- nored nature to find exhilaration in . . . coffee. Using italic or boldface type would be a wiser means of emphasis than separating a preposition from its object with a mis- applied punctuation mark. Some newspaper columnists use el- lipses to separate unrelated items placed in a common paragraph instead of indi- vidual paragraphs. “Three-dot journal- ism” is what one of them called it. The purpose of the ellipsis in the pas- sage below is obscure. A simple period or a new paragraph would do. Mr. Wagner, the former Pentagon official, said another reason for the Administration’s inaction was a ten- dency to focus on what turned out to be a much lesser problem, assuring supplies of plutonium for new bombs . . . Plutonium, a radioactive metal, decays very slowly; tritium de- cays at a rate of 5 . 5 percent a year. Merely eliminating the ellipsis would make the next sentence smoother: Few low[-]budget publications in the history of American journalism have approached its effective- ness . . . or its popularity. The article in which it appears uses el- lipses three times more, in quotations like this one (set off, as explained in 10 ): You know when you start writing a book at 78 .... At first, the ellipsis suggests that the quo- tation was cut short. But the context suggests another interpretation: that the speaker did not finish the sentence. The writer should have used a long dash, in- stead of an ellipsis (and a comma after “You know”). A manual for authors and editors con- dones the use of ellipses, even in quota- tions, to indicate “faltering speech” with “confusion or indecisiveness.” Such ad- vice invites indecisiveness by writers and confusion by readers, who may be un- able to tell whether a quotation is com- plete or not. Commas and dashes can handle the task without creating the am- biguity. Some writers omit parts of direct quo- tations without inserting the necessary ellipses. They seem to think that it is enough to insert their own words in parentheses or brackets. It is not. See 7B. 6. Exclamation point The exclamation point (!) exclaims. It screams. It symbolizes emotion, excite- ment. It may climax a cry of pain or shock, a fervent demand, or an uproari- ous laugh. An exclamation point can change the character of a word or phrase. “No” may just be providing information, whereas “No!” may be expressing shock or vehement refusal. “Oh” may just be acknowledging information; “Oh!” may be indicating surprise. “How big?” merely asks a question; “How big!” ex- presses surprise or awe, and it would make no sense to end such a phrase with a period. We use a play by Shakespeare to illus- trate some defensible uses of the excla- mation point: in an apostrophe, a hailing, a dictate, an alarm, an excited announcement, an expression of grief, an outcry, and an urgent entreaty. O valiant cousin! worthy gentle- man! . . . All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis! . . . Methought I heard a voice cry ‘Sleep no more! . . .’ Awake, awake! . . . Murder and trea- son!

Fowler sought to restrict the ex- clamation point to “what grammar rec- ognizes as exclamations”: interjections (“Golly!”), sentences with the exclama- tory what or how (“What a difference it makes!”), wishes (“God forbid!”), emo- tional ellipses and inversions (“If only I could!” and “A fine friend you have been!”), and apostrophes (“You little dear!”). He would not permit the mark in statements (“You surprise me”), ques- tions (“How dare you?”), and com- mands (“Don’t tell such lies”). Most authorities today do not set such strict limits but leave the use of ex- clamation points to the writer’s judg- ment. Nevertheless, they would probably agree that writings of the im- mature or inexperienced are likely to overuse the mark. The writer imposes it on an unexciting sentence in the belief that it adds excitement, or he appends it to a joke (with or without the “ha ha”) lest the reader fail to recognize it as such. He does not realize that understatement can be a stronger device than overstate- ment. A presidential candidate tried to make himself seem more exciting by putting an exclamation point after his name, but “Lamar!” failed to excite the voters. The musical show Oklahoma! did excite the public, but it probably would have done so without the punctuation. Some have the notion that using mul- tiple exclamation points, side by side, multiplies the excitement. A real estate ad advertises “RICHMOND DESIR- ABLE DEVELOPMENT SITE!!” A sign in the window of a restaurant says, “TRY OUR IRISH BREAKFAST!!!” Electric signs at train stations flash, “ATTENTION SAN FRANCISCO- BOUND PASSENGERS!!!! NO DI- RECT SERVICE . . . ON SUNDAY.” Appending those extra points is like la- beling the notice “unprofessional.” It is sloshing gold paint over the lily. Authors vary markedly in their readi- ness to resort to the exclamation point. F. Scott Fitzgerald was quoted as telling his ladylove, “Cut out all those exclama- tion points,” as he deleted them from a radio script that the public would never see. “An exclamation point is like laugh- ing at your own joke.” At the other ex- treme, a theoretical scientist employed it fifty times in a 198 -page book. Some ex- cerpts follow: To their great surprise, they found they were exactly the same! . . . Our sun, for comparison, is a mere eight light-minutes away! . . .

We shall not bridge that gap with particle accelerators in the fore- seeable future! Sometimes we find parentheses, which tone down a statement, combined with an exclamation point, which amplifies it.

For those of lesser prominence, re- straint is advisable, to afford the mark full value in the relatively few cases in which it is needed. Overuse can amount to a frivolous cry of “wolf!” See also 9D. 7. Parentheses and brackets A. Functions of these marks Parentheses ( ) are dropped into a sen- tence to set off an explanatory or inci- dental word, phrase, notation, figure, or abbreviation. Dashes or commas may be used in- stead for that purpose. Dashes, though, tend to give prominence to the inserted word etc. whereas parentheses play it down. Commas are intermediate in prominence. Brackets [ ] serve the same function as parentheses but are used inside direct quotations. The use of brackets indicates that the person doing the quoting, not the one who is quoted, has inserted the word or phrase. The first example indicates the correct use of parentheses and brackets. This and the examples in the next section are all quoted precisely; nothing has been added. Sen. David Pryor (D-Ark.), chair- man of the Senate Aging Committee, said in a letter to King that “a lengthy delay [in halting collection of the pre- miums] will create a firestorm of protest.” “D-Ark.” (Democrat from Arkansas) is in parentheses. The writer’s explanation of what is meant by “delay” is enclosed by brackets because it is inside a quota- tion. A pair of parentheses or brackets is used to append something to a sentence. Being an appendage, the enclosed matter does not replace any part of the sen- tence. The sentence must be complete without it and in no way depend on it. The use of brackets cannot substitute for any part of a direct quotation. If something is left out, an ellipsis ( . . . ) must be put in its place. A quotation must always be accurate apart from any matter in brackets. Parentheses do not go inside paren- theses, and brackets do not go inside brackets. When you need a parenthetical word etc. within a pair of parentheses, place it in brackets. For example: “( The Pittsburgh [Pa.] Press ).” When you need the parenthetical matter within a pair of brackets, place it in parentheses: “[ The Pittsburgh (Pa.) Press ].” The British have different terminol- ogy. Sir Ernest Gowers used the term parenthesis to include any of the four de- vices for inserting extra matter into a sentence: commas, dashes, “round brackets” ( ), and “square brackets” [ ]. B. Mishandling of quotations Four pairs of brackets appear in the press quotation below. All but the sec- ond pair are obviously misused. “The public is so panicked that [government] is trying to take away their means of defense that they are buying nationwide in record num- bers,” Kohn said. “I’ll probably lose a considerable percentage of business [because of the ordinance], but that’s not involved here. [The city] is tram- pling on the rights of law-abiding citi- zens for emotional appeal and political mileage.” Alan C——, an NRA member who repairs guns at a Van Nuys shop, said he will defy the new law because “I think what [the city] did was illegal.” Using four sets of brackets in four suc- cessive sentences may be overdoing it. More important, the writer has obvi- ously tampered with the speakers’ words, discarding some and substituting his own words three times. When we omit what he has appended, someone is 340 punctuation 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 340"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"quoted nonsensically as saying, “The public is so panicked that is trying to take away their means of defense”; a sentence begins “is trampling on the rights”; and another reads, “I think what did was illegal.” If the speakers did not say “government” and “the city,” what did they say and why are their words omitted? And why are there no el- lipses at the points of omission? ( See 5. ) Some newspapers go a step further in the mishandling of quotations by avoid- ing brackets entirely. “At no time did the consulate- general approach the (Foreign Min- istry) with a request to send an envoy,” said Iaan Basson, a spokes- man for the consulate-general. If he did not say “Foreign Ministry,” what did he say and why was it left out? And, again, why is there no ellipsis at the point of omission? The quotations below do not have words missing. They may have words added. “I must acknowledge that when I look at those figures (tax increases), I see that some of those businesses are going to have to restructure,” said Glenn Davis, district director in Kansas City for the Small Business Administration. . . . “The small businessman is in a vi- cious Catch- 22 ,” Jameson said. “If you eat it (the tax increase), the busi- ness has a very slow and painful death.” Using parentheses instead of brackets within quotations raises uncertainty whether the parenthetical words belong to the speaker or the writer. C. Other errors A New York publisher, in listing a se- ries of art booklets, indicates that the reader will find “Volume numbers in brackets.” What follows are forty-four pairs of parentheses: “( 14 ) . . . ( 36 ) . . . ( 13 )” and so on. It is obscure whether the editor who put the list into print was British and neglected to make the correc- tion for American readers or was Ameri- can and just did not know any better. The main part of a sentence must be grammatically independent of any par- enthetical matter. A general dictionary erred in this definition of vivisect: To dissect (an animal) while living, with a view to exposing its physiolog- ical processes. “Its” lacks an antecedent in the main part of the sentence; instead it refers to “an animal,” which is a mere parentheti- cal phrase. (The sentence is additionally defective in containing a dangler: It is only “while living” that one does any- thing. “. . . While an animal is living” would fix both defects. See Modifiers, 1, about danglers.) The parenthetical material should be in a particular sentence for a good rea- son. In the next sample, the statement in parentheses is irrelevant. The writer evi- dently did not know where else to put it. Napoleon’s conversations with Bertrand and Moncholon (it is unfor- tunate that there are several misprints in the book) are a skillful blending of record and pastiche. A parenthetical insert may fit smoothly into the rest of the sentence or be a virtual sentence itself. If it is the lat- ter and the insert is too long or too far- fetched, it may tear the message asunder and make readers backtrack. Below, the narrative is interrupted by the abrupt quotation in parentheses in addition to the parenthetical matter between the commas. It is now an accepted fact that Taney, old and worn as he was, or perhaps punctuation 341 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 341"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"because he was old and worn and had little to fear (“I was ever a fighter, so—one fight more, the best and the last!”), went from Washington to Bal- timore for the specific purpose of en- tertaining Merryman’s application. Three messages intervene between “Taney” and “went.” Putting them into another sentence or two might have im- proved them all. Parentheses and brackets should al- ways come in pairs. The use of one parenthesis is not standard, except at the Internal Revenue Service: You must include in your income dif- ficulty-of-care payments received for more than: 1 ) 10 children under age 19 , and 2 ) 5 individuals age 19 or older. A comma or semicolon that coincides with a parenthetical or bracketed pas- sage follows the closing parenthesis or bracket: “Although Mercury’s year is only one-fourth the length of ours ( 88 earth days), its day is 59 times as long as ours.” See also 8. 8. Period The single dot called a period (.) goes at the end of nearly every sentence that does not end with a question mark (?) or an exclamation point (!); those two marks have built-in periods. (Infre- quently a sentence ends with a dash, in- dicating an unfinished sentence. See 4C. ) Periods go only at the end of sentences (or sentence fragments), except in abbre- viations or initialisms. Within a sen- tence, even a complete thought gets no period: “I think perhaps—it’s just specu- lation—he was advised that maybe some of the money was being diverted.” If four dots follow a sentence, the first dot is a period; the next three make up an ellipsis. See 5A. In the United States, a period goes be- fore a closing quotation mark: “Let our drums strike.” In Britain, a period—or full stop, as it is known there—goes after a closing quotation mark: ‘Let our drums strike’. See 10. Periods are not used in isolated titles, headlines, and subheads, except in the manner of the 8 at the head of this sec- tion. No additional period is needed when one used in an abbreviation or initialism ends a sentence. Two dots do not nor- mally go together. Periods are customarily used in some initialisms, particularly when they spell words without the periods (U.S., A.D., A.M.). The trend, however, is away from them (NY, AMA, YMCA). They are used in abbreviations (Dr., Mr., Lt. Gen., Rt. Rev.) but not in acronyms (AIDS, DOS, NATO). ( See Abbreviation, 2. ) When part of a sentence appears in parentheses or brackets and it ends the sentence, the period goes after the clos- ing parenthesis or bracket, not before. The period is misplaced here: “Peanut oil . . . often can be used for flavoring (I prefer it for stir frying.)” Reverse the or- der of parenthesis and period: “. . . stir frying).” The period goes before the closing parenthesis or bracket when the paren- thetical or bracketed passage forms an independent sentence: “Peanut oil . . . of- ten can be used for flavoring. (I prefer it for stir frying.)” 9. Question mark A. Missing What is missing in the following sen- tence (from a New York newspaper)? The artist had a show in the spring at Farleigh-Dickinson University in Madison, and 20 of the Empire State Buildings are on display in, where else, the lobby of the Empire State Building at Fifth Avenue and 34 th Street. 342 punctuation 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 342"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"The answer is—what else?—a question mark after “where else.” The phrase is a question, so the mark (?) must follow. (However, the question would be set off better by dashes or parentheses than by commas.) Although the question mark com- monly goes at the end of a sentence, it may be more appropriate elsewhere. When a question ends before the end of its sentence, the mark can go at the end of the question; it should not be left out, as it was in the excerpt below from a book of criticism. How are computers going to make craniums smaller—unless, of course, they turn the brain into a recessive or- gan. Insert a question mark after “smaller.” ( See also OF COURSE, 1. ) A rhetorical question is still a ques- tion, albeit meant to emphasize a point, not to obtain information. The two quo- tations above and the one following il- lustrate that type of question. A column on an editorial page quotes an official on a goal of U.S. foreign policy and says: “What’s wrong with a goal like that.” What’s wrong with the sentence is the lack of a question mark instead of the period. “But the sentences can be under- stood,” someone will say, and it is so. But unsweetened lemonade can be drunk; it is about as complete and satis- fying as sentences like those. Sometimes meaning hinges on the presence or absence of a question mark. “Throw it away” gives instruction. “Throw it away?” seeks instruction. “This is a comedy” gives information. “This is a comedy?” expresses doubt. “What?” asks for information. “What!” expresses surprise. Question mark is sometimes called in- terrogation mark or interrogation point. B. Needless When a direct question is affixed to a statement, the question gets the mark: “ ‘What is in the box?’ she asked the spirit.” Or “She had to know—What is in the box?” But a statement that pre- sents a question indirectly does not get a question mark: “She had to know what was in the box.” Thus the song title “I Wonder Who’s Kissing Her Now?” should not have the question mark it was given (although the title phrase got no question mark in the text of the song). It is making a state- ment, not asking a question. A question would be “Who’s kissing her now?” The noun question has several mean- ings besides a query or interrogation, which is a sentence or phrase that tends to call for a reply. Question can denote an issue, a point under consideration, a problem, a proposal to vote on, a query expressed indirectly, a subject for debate, or uncertainty. Calling an expression of any of these other meanings a question does not make it one in the sense of an interrogation. A book relates a historical episode: During the court-martial, Flipper’s attorney had put the question squarely: “Whether it is possible for a colored man to secure and hold a po- sition as an officer of the Army?” The clause in quotation marks is a sum- mary of a question in the sense of a problem or an issue. It should get no question mark, inasmuch as it is a declarative statement, not an interroga- tion. It would be an interrogation if it began Is it instead of “Whether it is.” To use more than one question mark, side by side, does not make a phrase or sentence any more of an interrogation. It does make it amateurish. A magazine ad for a computer company bore this head- line: punctuation 343 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 343"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"?????? Should - Should Not . . . . . . Invest in a Computer ?????? All twelve question marks could not turn that phrase into a proper question, such as “Should I, or should I not, invest in a computer?” (Nor could the spacious hy- phen or the sextet of dots contribute anything, neither being bona fide punc- tuation.) C. Two opposing views Does a request or statement in the form of a question call for a question mark? Grammarians differ. H. W. Fowler argued the affirmative. Among his examples: “Will you please stand back?” and “Will it be believed that . . . ?”—presenting an incredible fact of sizable length. Because each is in the grammatical form of a direct question, each should end with a question mark, even though it is equivalent in sense to a request or statement. Theodore M. Bernstein took essen- tially the opposite view, that no question mark should be used when an answer is not expected or when the writer is merely making a request. He gave as re- spective examples: “May we have the pleasure of hearing from you soon” and “Would you please send us a duplicate copy of your invoice.” Fowler would stick question marks at the end of those two. So would I. They look incomplete, and a writer of each would want a response, though not a yes or no answer. The Chicago Manual of Style wants no question mark at the end of any “request courteously disguised as a question.” But why give up the dis- guise—and the courtesy—prematurely? D. With other punctuation When a question mark does not end a sentence, may a comma follow? Most authorities think not. They approve of this form: “Do you choose to run?” they asked. A few others approve of this form: “Do you choose to run?,” they asked. Some sentences may be followed ei- ther by question marks or by exclama- tion points, depending on the meaning to be conveyed. If an answer is sought: “How common is that mistake?” If the sentence is exclamatory or rhetorical: “How common is that mistake!” The writer of a music textbook made a choice between the two marks, in de- scribing Beethoven’s attitude toward Napoleon: A conqueror himself—did he not once declare, “I too am a king!”—he un- derstood the Corsican. The author chose the exclamation point. He attributed it to Beethoven, for it lies within the quotation marks. Thus the author’s question is left without punctu- ation. It would have been preferable to omit the exclamation point and add a question mark: . . . Did he not once declare, “I too am a king”? . . . If the author knew that the exclamation point was part of the quotation and deemed it important, both marks could have appeared: . . . Did he not once declare, “I too am a king!”? . . . Note that the question mark follows the closing quotation mark when the ques- tion is that of the writer. 10. Quotation marks Quotation marks are primarily used to quote what people say or write. “Well, I’m not a crook.” / “Hail to thee, 344 punctuation 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 344"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"blithe Spirit!” The words enclosed in the marks are expected to reproduce the original words exactly; otherwise the marks should be omitted. Anything left out is replaced by an ellipsis ( . . . ). See 5. Anything inserted goes in brackets [ ], not parentheses ( ). See 7. A magazine is interviewing a painter. Amid a long paragraph devoted entirely to a direct quotation of his, this sentence appears: She read me Malory’s “Le Morte d’Arthur” and made it understand- able. The entire passage is enclosed, correctly, by double quotation marks (“ ”). There- fore the marks around Le Morte d’Arthur should be single quotation marks (‘ ’). If the magazine were pub- lished in London, instead of New York, the procedure would need to be re- versed: single quotation marks would go on the outside, double quotation marks on the inside. It is wrong to put double marks within double marks, or single marks within single marks. Customarily the names of long liter- ary, dramatic, or artistic works go in ital- ics, also called italic type. This is it. When that type is unavailable or not de- sired for some reason, it is not wrong to put the names in quotation marks in- stead. ( See Italic[s]. ) In quoting someone who is quoting someone else, use double quotation marks for the main quotation and single quotation marks for the interior quota- tion. (In Britain reverse the procedure.) If the interior quotation marks are left out, the meaning may be unclear, as in the following press passage. “He” refers to the vice president. “He said Dave Keene called me a lap dog,” said Mr. Dole, referring to one of his campaign aides. A reader’s first impression is that “me” refers to Mr. Dole. That interpretation would not fit the context, however. Inte- rior quotation marks should have been inserted as follows: “He said ‘Dave Keene called me a lap dog,’ ” said Mr. Dole. . . . When a comma or period is needed at the end of a direct quotation, the con- ventional American practice is to put it inside the quotation marks. (“But,” he said——) This is done for an aesthetic reason, whether or not the comma or pe- riod is part of the quotation. Some choose, on logical grounds, to put it out- side the quotation marks unless it is part of the quotation. (“But”, he said——) That practice is common in Britain. When a colon or semicolon is needed at the end of a direct quotation, placing it after the closing quotation mark is gen- erally favored by both nations (“. . . my land”; it is——), although a few publica- tions have rules to the contrary. A quotation that goes into more than one paragraph gets an opening quota- tion mark at the beginning of each para- graph; a closing quotation mark goes only at the end of the entire quotation. These are typical mistakes: On an edito- rial page, an isolated quotation is two paragraphs long and the second para- graph lacks an opening quotation mark. Elsewhere, an article begins by quoting three lines of a song in three paragraphs, of which the second and third lack open- ing quotation marks. We do not add quotation marks to the examples that are set off typographically in this book and so are obviously quota- tions (often the longer ones). We do add the marks to quotations that run in the main text, to words and phrases taken from those quotations, and to typical sentences that illustrate usage. In addi- tion, quotation marks go around certain words or phrases to indicate that the en- punctuation 345 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 345"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"closures, though used, are nonstandard or questionable. Examples are the entry titles “AIN’T” and “LET’S DON’T.” Newspaper copy editors in the United States follow the British tradition in one respect: using single quotation marks for quotations in headlines. (What Americans call quotation marks, the British call inverted commas, a term that is not precise. In a traditional type style, with curved quotation marks, only the opening mark of a pair of single quotation marks looks like an inverted comma [‘]. The closing mark looks like an apostrophe, which can be described as an elevated comma [’]. Typewriters have straight, vertical quotation marks; in this respect, most computers are no improvement.) See also Quotation problems; QUOTE and QUOTATION; Tense, 3; THAT, 4. 11. Semicolon A. Weak period Do not take the name literally. The semicolon (;) is not half of the colon (:), nor does it have anything to do with the colon. At different times, the semicolon acts as a weak period and a strong comma. Just as a period does, the semicolon can end a complete thought. However, it links that complete thought—an inde- pendent clause— with another, closely re- lated in meaning or form. “Three men went to bat; three men went down swinging.” / “Money itself is not a root of evil; the love of money is.” / “He came; he saw; he conquered.” In that way, the semicolon performs the linking function of a conjunction, like and or but. A writer might choose to use no semicolon and instead insert a conjunction (“He came, he saw, and he conquered”) or to use neither and make each independent clause a separate sen- tence. (“He came. He saw. He con- quered.”) B. Strong comma Offering a stronger division than a comma, the semicolon is particularly useful in dividing a sentence into cate- gories when the sentence already has commas. Even when a conjunction connects in- dependent clauses, a writer may choose to put a semicolon between them to show the division clearly. It is particu- larly desirable to do so when a clause contains a comma or is lengthy. This is a correct example from a book on world history: To many authorities it appeared at first incredible that a sub-man with a brain no larger than that of an ape could manufacture tools, crude in- deed but made to a fairly standard and recognizable pattern; but the newest evidence leaves little room for doubt. In that sentence, what follows the comma is parenthetical; what follows the semicolon is a main thought, and the semicolon so indicates. Not only clauses benefit from the semicolon. It is needed to separate items in a series when any item is subdivided by a comma. “The club elected George Watkins, president; John Anthony, vice- president; and Theresa Jennings, secre- tary-treasurer.” The lack of semicolons jumbles the se- ries below, from an autobiography. Readers could have trouble associating the names with the descriptions. John Major greeted me, my executive assistant, Colonel Dick Chilcoat, the British secretary of state for defense, Tom King, and my counterpart, British chief of defense staff, Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir David Craig, in a sitting room at 10 Down- ing Street. Replacing the first, third, and fifth com- mas with semicolons (and inserting the 346 punctuation 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 346"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"after the sixth) would have made the sentence more readily understandable. C. Inconsistency Newspapers are liable to be inconsis- tent in their use of semicolons in a series, and this is an example: Among the Americans at the Moscow forum were Norman Mailer, Gore Vidal and Bel Kaufman, the writers; John Kenneth Galbraith, the economist; Gregory Peck and Kris Kristofferson, the actors; several sci- entists, including Frank von Hippel, a Princeton physicist, and more than a dozen businessmen. After the third semicolon, the system ends, permitting two chances for misun- derstanding. Literally the message con- veyed is that “several scientists” include all those mentioned thereafter. Dismiss- ing businessmen from the scientific ranks, the reader could plausibly place “a Princeton physicist” in a separate cat- egory. If patient, the reader might suc- ceed in deciphering the confused list, maybe even in diagnosing the problem: a missing semicolon after “physicist.” The writer is not to blame; an inexpli- cable rule of his newspaper (shared by various other papers) has instructed him to use a comma where the final semi- colon belongs. But a comma does not perform the function of a semicolon. If the writer, economist, actor, and scientist categories need to be separated from one another by semicolons, does not the sci- entist category need to be separated from the businessman category by a semicolon? 12. Virgule This / is a virgule (pronounced VUR- gyool). It is also known as a slash or solidus (SOL-uh-duss). Sometimes it is called a slant, diagonal, bar, or shilling. The mark has specialized uses, partic- ularly in technical, legal, and business writing. It is less suited to general prose than the marks of punctuation discussed in preceding sections. The virgule is an alternative to a hori- zontal line in separating the two parts of a fraction, such as 13 / 16 . It replaces per in such terms as miles/hour and feet/sec- ond. In science and medicine, mg/km, for instance, is an economical way to ex- press milligrams of dosage per kilogram of body weight. When lines of poetry are written in regular text, the virgule indi- cates each new line: “On a battle- trumpet’s blast / I fled hither, fast, fast, fast, / ’Mid the darkness upward cast.” This book uses virgules to separate quo- tations when they are run successively in regular text. The mark often represents or, notably in the term and/or, meaning either and or or as the case may be. Lawyers make use of it. A typical contract uses the term this way: Company and/or its insurer shall have the right to select counsel and to settle any claim upon the terms and condi- tions it and/or its insurer deems satis- factory. A computer manual contains such headings as “Paper Size/Type” and “Short/Long Document Names,” in which the virgule presumably means ei- ther and or or. A computer program has an option called “Move/Rename File,” in which the virgule substitutes for or. The pro- gram also has a table explaining that if the user presses “Up/Down Arrow” (meaning either the up arrow or the down arrow ), the curser will move to “The top/bottom of the screen” (mean- ing the top or bottom of the screen re- spectively). This \\ is a back slash, or backslash; it is used for certain computer commands, and so is the regular slash. In business, the mark in a combina- tion like vice president/labor relations punctuation 347 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 347"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"can replace in charge of. For the general public, the full term is more widely un- derstandable. Virgules have been increasingly used of late instead of traditional punc- tuation and even instead of words. The substitution may be no improvement: Take “secretary/treasurer” instead of secretary-treasurer or “bacon/tomato sandwich” instead of bacon-tomato sandwich. An original use of a virgule in lieu of a verbal description can even be ambiguous: Diners cannot be sure whether the virgule means and or or in a menu’s “steak/lobster plate.” Some general writers seem to find the virgule stylish. One dispenses with commas and conjunctions to describe someone as a “writer/painter/photogra- pher” and later writes, “She has this phobia/quirk/fatal flaw. . . .” PUPIL and STUDENT. An elemen- tary-school child is a pupil. Anyone who takes personal instruction from a teacher also may be called a pupil. “Beethoven was Haydn’s pupil.” One who attends an institution of learning above elementary school is a student. A student is also anyone who studies or investigates a particular sub- ject, perhaps “a student of prehistory” or “a student of the drug problem.” A news story said: The alleged victims [of abuse] were two boys, ages 3 and 4 , both students at the S—— . . . Pre- & Elementary School. . . . Three- and four-year-old “students”? It was not explained just what they would or could be studying. Elsewhere a photo depicted a cluster of diminutive moppets for whom the designation of “Students at the primary school in Portalesa, Brazil” hardly seemed fitting. And an ar- ticle about an Indiana elementary school used the unsuitable noun a dozen times: Students [range] from kindergartners to fifth graders. . . . The school . . . [encourages] students to think across subject lines. . . . Students play with board games and puzzles [and so on]. “Students” should have been pupils in each instance. A child attending school used to be called a scholar. Now a scholar usually is an advanced academic specialist or a person who is learned in the humanities. Sometimes a school child is described as “a good scholar” or “a bad scholar.” Schoolboy and schoolgirl are sometimes used, less often than they used to be. PURPORT, PURPORTED. 1. An odd verb. 2. Other uses. 1. An odd verb Purport is a strange verb, for two rea- sons: • Although it has the form of an active verb, it has the meaning of a passive verb. It means is— or are or was or were—supposed (to be) or represented (to be). The sense of is etc. is built into purported, and therefore is etc. should not be used with it. It is wrong to say, “The signature on the letter is purported to be genuine.” Change “is purported” to purports. • Its subject normally is not a person. A sentence like “He purported to tell investigators the whole story” is wrong. Changing “purported” to professed, or another appropriate verb, corrects the sentence. (One may say, “Miranda purports to protect a constitutional right.” Although a subject may not be a person considered as such, the subject here really is a thing, a legal rule named after a person.) 348 pupil and student 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 348"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"The three excerpts below fall short on both scores. Each uses “is” or “was” with “purport” and makes a person the subject. The first two are from books. . . . Jackson is purported to have said, “John Marshall has made his deci- sion; now let him enforce it.” Wellington is purported to have writ- ten to the British Foreign Office in London: “We have enumerated our saddles, bridles, tents and tent poles.” A replacement for each “purported” could be supposed or believed. In the sentence below, from a news story, “pur- ported” could be changed to professing or pretending. Mr. Brucan said also that he had learned for the first time this after- noon that Mr. Munteanu was pur- porting to speak for the council on Monday mornings. . . . 2. Other uses Purport is also a noun. It denotes the supposed significance or meaning of something: “the purport of his speech was that. . . .” Purported may be used as an adjective, meaning supposed. Purport and purported— verb, noun, and adjective—do not confirm or deny the authenticity of anything (for exam- ple, a document or antique) but mildly question it. Without this element of modest doubt, purport (ed) is not the word to use. Some people use “purport” (noun) instead of purpose or purview. They do so either mistakenly, thinking that the similarity of sound carries over to the meaning; or intentionally, seeking a fancy synonym. That some dictionaries support the confusion should be no sur- prise. PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. Mil- lions listening on radio and television heard a prosecutor in a murder case tell the jury that he had read the Constitu- tion the previous night and it said the two victims had the right to liberty and life and more: “It said they had a right to the pursuit of happiness.” Not so. Earlier, an anchor man wrongly stated on a television network: “The Constitu- tion guarantees us life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” Had he substi- tuted property for “the pursuit of happi- ness,” he would have been right. The true word would have been irrelevant for the prosecutor. The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution says that no person shall be deprived of “life, liberty, or property” without due process of law. The Fourteenth Amendment echoes that principle, prohibiting any state from de- priving any person of “life, liberty, or property” without due process of law. The Constitution says nothing about happiness or its pursuit. The document that does mention it is the Declaration of Independence, whose second sentence reads: We hold these Truths to be self- evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Lib- erty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. While of historical, philosophical, and literary interest, the Declaration of Inde- pendence has no legal significance. PUSH. See ADVOCATE. PUT. See INTO, 1. PUTSCH.

An impromptu, witty remark may be called a quip (noun). To make it is to quip (verb, in- transitive). It is probably rare that real wit or hu- mor needs to be labeled as such, but the press seems to disagree. In typical fash- ion, a reporter added “he quipped” to a judge’s remark, about how people mis- pronounced his name; and a columnist quoting a talk by a mayor explained that one remark was made “jokingly” and another was “quipped.” None of the quotations displayed recognizable wit or humor, and the labels failed to rescue them. Crack(ed), gag(ged), jest(ed), and joke(d) are among the terms that have been so used. QUITE. This adverb can be ambigu- ous: “He was quite truthful.” Was he scrupulously truthful or just generally so? “The place is quite big.” Is it im- mense or just sizable? Does “quite good” describe a superb show or a fairly enjoyable one? Used strictly, quite means completely, extremely, or really. Used informally or casually, it means somewhat, rather, or considerably. In the casual vein, quite followed by a or an can suggest an indef- inite number or amount (“quite a few”) or something notable (“quite an array”). If quite is interpreted in the strict way, “quite complete” is redundant and “quite similar” is contradictory. Few critics insist on strictness under informal circumstances. In a more formal con- text, a vague quite can be deadwood. A book uses it strictly at first: The viola is not an outsize violin. Its proportions are quite different and its tone is quite distinctive. Then casually. See whether “quite” makes any useful contribution here: There are quite a number of falla- cies regarding musical design which need to be exploded. Quotation marks.

Accuracy and inaccuracy Quotations, particularly direct quota- tions—those in quotation marks—are supposed to present what people have said or written. But not all writers and editors are scrupulous about quotations. A linguistics professor in Arizona compared twenty-four newspaper arti- cles with tape recordings of interviews, meetings, and speeches. Only 8 percent of 132 quoted sentences came out com- pletely right. Most were compatible with the original, but some were dead wrong: “People from Spain” turned into “Mexi- cans” and “He has so impressed all five of us” became “He has so impressed us as interim county manager.” Stories written by reporters who used tape recorders were not more accurate than those by reporters who just took notes. Few American journalists know short- hand. Inaccurate quotations may represent unintentional error, inadequate skill or memory, lack of respect for quotation marks, doctoring of statements suppos- edly to improve them, or outright fabri- cation. The Columbia Journalism Review quoted three New York re- porters who admitted making up quota- tions. Instead of interviewing parents whose children had died, “I made the quotes up,” one said. Another put words in the mouth of a baseball manager. A third pretended to quote a bystander at a parade. Six others knew of imaginary quotations in newspapers and maga- zines. A writer or editor is not obligated to quote anyone directly. A quotation that is important enough to use but improper, too long, poorly worded, or otherwise unsuitable as it is may be reworded, in whole or part, without quotation marks. Editors have been known to put such in- direct quotations in quotation marks. It is a hazardous practice. Deliberately altering a quotation can not only be unethical: the Supreme Court has said that it can be libelous— that is, false and defamatory—if it “re- sults in a material change in the meaning conveyed by the statement” ( 1991 ). For the misquoting of sayings, see Clichés; THAT and WHICH, 4. See also LIBEL and SLANDER. 2. Inconsistency in person and tense Quotation marks are presumed to en- close the exact words that someone has used. The exact words quoted in this passage from a historical book are un- likely to have been uttered: A Senator . . . was so overwhelmed by the implications of the crisis that he “feels that the Executive has not gone so far as to justify” the attack on Pen- sacola. Delivering a speech in the Senate, he probably did not say “I feels.” He is more likely to have said “I feel.” Even so, the sentence shifts awkwardly from past tense to present tense. The non- quoted and quoted parts need to fit to- gether: [Example:] A Senator was so over- whelmed by the implications of the crisis that he said, “I feel that the Ex- ecutive has not. . . .” If the exact words of the speaker are un- certain (perhaps the author is quoting a contemporary account of the speech in the third person), it is best to omit the quotation marks: [Example:] A Senator was so over- whelmed by the implications of the crisis that he said he felt that the Exec- utive had not. . . .

Unnecessary quotation marks Quotation marks are often used un- necessarily. When nobody is being quoted, the marks can cast doubt upon a word or phrase. Four examples follow. [Magazine:] First we’ll separate the volunteers into two groups: a treat- ment group and a “control” group. [Newsletter:] Our goal at any given time is to strive continually to be “the best”. [Notice at a bank:] . . . we will close our “teller counter service” at 5 p.m. [Picture captions in an ad for a cos- metic surgeon:] “NOSE” BEFORE . . . “NOSE” AFTER Control is a legitimate word, and the best is a legitimate phrase; neither needed quotation marks. The marks did not express confidence in the bank ser- vice. And there was no doubt that a woman pictured in the surgeon’s ad had a nose. (The second example follows a closing quotation mark with a period, in British style, although the publication is American. See Punctuation, 10. See also CONTINUAL[LY] and CONTINU- OUS[LY]. ) 4. When is the quotation over? A congressman made a speech in which he read a quotation. As heard on the radio, the quotation seemed to go on and on. Finally it became plain that he had finished his quoting but failed to say “end of quotation” or “so said ———” or “the words of ———” or even the dubious “unquote.” ( See QUOTE and QUOTATION. ) Whichever term is chosen, a speaker who quotes someone or something should indicate when the quotation has ended, unless it is well known and short. Otherwise listeners may not know when the speaker’s own words have resumed, especially if they cannot see him. Even to a viewing audience, the transition may not be obvious if the speech is read from a paper or a prompting screen. QUOTE and QUOTATION. Quote is properly a verb (transitive and intran- sitive). To quote is to repeat someone’s words, usually acknowledging that they are another’s words. You might quote a sentence, quote (a passage from) a book, quote (words of) Shakespeare or the pope, or quote from a magazine or a speech, saying “I quote.” Although it may pass in informal speech, using the verb as a noun is not appropriate in more formal media: “A frontispiece quote set the tone: ‘All wholesome food is caught without a net or a trap.’ ” / “Drexel liked the quote so much that one of its investment bankers framed it.” / “Reporters simply go out and lazily round up quotes to fit the poll results. . . .” The newspaper, news service, and news magazine quoted above should have used the noun quotation or quota- tions. Use of “quote” to mean quota- tion, or “quotes” to mean quotations or quotation marks, is part of the jargon of editors, reporters, and writers. The jargon includes “unquote,” often used by speakers in lieu of end of quota- tion. It was created as an economical form in telegrams from news correspon- dents, not as a bona fide word. A book publisher protested on na- tional television that a magazine had published a derogatory “misquote” and that to do so was sloppy. A neater word is misquotation. Occasionally a quotation is accompa- nied by an incomplete phrase, in this manner: “ ‘It’s not true,’ the Governor was quoted.” It should be “was quoted as saying. ” See also Punctuation, 10; Quotation problems. 352 quote and quotation 03-M–Q_4 10/22/02 10:32 AM Page 352"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"RACE and NATIONALITY. 1. The difference. 2. Races of the U.S.A. 3. Who is colored? 1. The difference Race (noun) has often been mixed up with other terms, including nationality. Race is a category of mankind distin- guished by physical characteristics that are genetically transmitted, such as skin color, shape of head, type of hair, and fa- cial features. Nationality concerns the nation one belongs to and is based on politics, geography, or culture. Racial and national (adjectives) mean pertain- ing to, or based on differences in, race or nationality. A newspaper confused the terms: All along the border the population is a strange mix of people and tongues: Polish, German, Czech, Hungarian, Romanian, Ukrainian and Russian—typical of the racial mix that Russia has throughout its far-flung country. “Polish, German, Czech,” etc. do refer to “people and tongues,” that is, nation- alities and languages. None of them are racial groups, so they are not “typical of the racial mix” in Russia, which extends to the Orient and does contain different races. 2. Races of the U.S.A. Citizens of the United States share a common nationality while comprising many national origins and several races. Three leading racial divisions of the world are represented in this country: the Caucasoid, Negroid, and Mon- goloid. Members of the first two groups are commonly known as white or black, respectively (nouns or adjectives), al- though nobody has skin that is really white or black. They are informal terms and need not be capitalized. A somewhat more scientific alterna- tive to white is Caucasian, though tech- nically there are brown-skinned Cauca- sians. The corresponding term for black is Negro, which fell out of popularity in the late sixties but survives in the United Negro College Fund. (The word should always be capitalized and pronounced like KNEE-grow, even though Webster’s Third Dictionary enters “negro” and condones the rather derogatory NIG- ruh. Eighteen of its entries use “nigger.” Insulting terms of that sort appear with the qualification “usu. taken to be offen- sive.”) Black, which had been consid- ered derogatory, became the accepted word. In the eighties African-American caught on as a formal term. It has less utility, covering only Americans; it would not include, say, a black Con- golese. Nor would it include a natural- ized American who was one of the race and nationality 353 R 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 353"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"nearly 200 million nonblack natives of Africa. Mongoloid or Mongolian to denote a racial division that includes Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, Mongolians, Ti- betans, and others is usually restricted to scientific writing. Yellow used to be the popular adjective, even though no one is really yellow. It was supplanted by Ori- ental. Then Asian took over (its syn- onym, Asiatic, is offensive to some), even though the Indian subcontinent and the Middle East are part of the Asian conti- nent and Japan is not. Indian has long been used to refer to any aboriginal group of the Americas. Its use is said to date back to Columbus, who mistook San Salvador Island for In- dia. Those in the United States are Amer- ican Indians. In recent years that term has come to trouble some people (mainly non-Indians—many American Indian groups call themselves that), who foster “Native American” as a synonym. Users of that term exclude most native-born Americans and several indigenous peo- ples under the American flag: Aleuts, Es- kimos, Hawaiians ( see Hawaii ), Samoans, and aboriginal inhabitants of other U.S. island possessions. American Indians used to be commonly considered the red race, although of brown skin, not red. In summary, styles in racial designa- tion come and go, and few of them make total sense. See also 3. It suffices to use a term that many members of a group prefer. Not all mem- bers agree on any given term. 3. Who is colored? The term “colored” is nearly obsolete, though it survives in the National Asso- ciation for the Advancement of Colored People. It is odd that some who would consider it backward to call someone a “colored” person now have no qualms about calling him a person “of color.” It can be a euphemism for nonwhite or for black. A large headline over a newspaper story about suburban minorities an- nounced “Greener Pastures for People of Color.” An article in another paper about a tribute to Jackie Robinson re- ferred to the “obvious presence of such people of color. . . . ” Users of that term should explain why they do not regard any tint of pinkish tan as a color. Here is a paradox, brought up by a physics professor and later by the host of a radio talk show: From the standpoint of physics, black is colorless, being the absence of light, while white contains all frequencies of light. Therefore, if any people were literally black, they would be devoid of color; and if any people were literally white, they would be as colored as anyone could get. RACK and WRACK. In writing that “the Palestinian uprising . . . had wracked the occupied lands since 1987 ,” did a writer mean to say that it had ru- ined them? Probably the right word would have been racked, without the w. To rack (verb, transitive) is literally to torture (someone) on the rack; more broadly to torture or torment with phys- ical or mental pain, or to strain, espe- cially by violence or oppression. The rack was a medieval instrument for tor- turing people by stretching their bodies. Two expressions are racked with pain ( or illness etc.) and rack one’s brains ( or memory etc.). To wrack (verb, transitive) is to de- stroy, ruin, or wreck (something). It is archaic and poetic. Wrack (noun) is vio- lently caused damage or destruction, or wreckage of a ship cast ashore. The main use of the noun nowadays is in the ex- pression (to bring to) wrack and ruin. Think of wreck, which also has a w. Rack and wrack are pronounced the same. They come from separate Middle English words, which in turn may be traced to separate Middle Dutch words.

An obituary of a rather prosperous “bag lady” quoted an acquaintance: “She looked like a little rag muffin, like she didn’t have a dime to her name.” Ragamuffin is the term, and it has nothing to do with muffins. It does have something to do with rags. The word comes from Ragamoffyn, the name of a demon in a fourteenth-century religious play, Piers Plowman, attributed to William Langland. Demons often were described as ragged, in the sense of shaggy. At first ragamuffin referred to a man who was disreputable as well as ragged. It came to describe any poorly clothed and dirty person. Now it is usually re- served for an ill-clothed, unkempt, or dirty child. RAIN, REIGN, and REIN. See Ho- mophones. RALLY. Was a TV panelist’s use of ral- lies right? “When he sees one of his friends is in trouble, he rallies around that person.” The verb was right. The preposition was wrong. Make it “he rallies to that person.” Two meanings of the verb rally (intransitive) were mixed up. It can mean to come to help, the meaning the panelist intended; or it can mean to get together for a common purpose, some- thing one person cannot do: “Let’s rally round the flag, boys.” The same verb can also mean to re- cover from a setback (“The patient ral- lied” or “Stocks rallied on Wall Street”) or, in tennis, to exchange several strokes. Rally (transitive) means to call together for a common purpose (“He rallied his troops”) or to bring back to activity (“She rallied her strength”). RAN and RUN. See Tense, 5A, B. R AND R. A U.S. Army general “said he was trying to arrange ‘R and R,’ rest and relaxation tours, inside and outside the kingdom.” Reporting from Arabia, a newspaper got the expression R and R right but its meaning wrong. It is not “rest and relaxation.” Neither is it “rest and recreation,” a popular interpreta- tion. By U.S. Army regulations, it stands for rest and recuperation. That is the def- inition of R & R in all the U.S. armed services, the Dictionary of Military Ab- breviations says. Another general writes in an autobi- ography: Soon after I joined the headquar- ters staff, I flew to Hong Kong for rest and recreation. For some GIs, R and R in this indulgent city meant wall-to- wall sex. For others, Hong Kong meant a shopping spree. An enumeration of his purchases fol- lows. Range, true and false. 1. As a noun, numerical and other senses. 2. As a verb, numerical sense; RANGE or RANG- ING used. 3. RANGING implied. 4. Stale expression: “EVERYTHING FROM.” 1. As a noun: numerical and other senses The numerical sense is what mainly concerns us first. In statistics a range is the difference between the highest and lowest in a set of figures. If the highest is 15 and the lowest is 5 , the range is 10 . In ordinary use, it is the extent to which a series of numbers vary: “The price range is $ 10 to $ 20 .” / “The range in their ages is 13 to 17 .” An appraiser said of an antique chair, “We would value it to be in the $ 3 , 000 range.” As he used it, “range” had no meaning. No other figure was given. Range would be meaningful if he had placed the value, for instance, “in the range, true and false 355 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 355"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"$ 2 , 000 -to-$ 4 , 000 range.” The value of a single figure can be expressed in many ways; for instance, “We would value it at about $ 3 , 000 .” A range (noun) can also be an extent or scope of activity or existence (“the range of our weapons” / “the range of possibilities”), a region in which an ani- mal or plant lives (“the range of this species”), an open area for livestock (“home on the range”), a place for the test firing or flying of weapons or rockets (a rifle range, a missile range); or the variation in pitch of a musical instru- ment or voice (“She has a range of three octaves”). 2. As a verb, numerical sense; RANGE or RANGING used In a numerical sense, the verb range (used intransitively) is strictly expressed in the following pair of examples: Women’s cycles also tend to be less ex- pensive than men’s, ranging from $ 1 , 000 to $ 4 , 000 . . . . The Communities’ list of languages to foster ranges from Ladin, a neo- Latin spoken by about 30 , 000 moun- tain Italians, to Catalan, which has around 7 million speakers. Used in that manner, to range means to vary within specified limits, or extremes. The limits may be, for example, prices of $ 1 , 000 and $ 4 , 000 ; about 30 , 000 and 7 million speakers; 147 and 160 pounds; first and sixth grades; Maine and Florida; adagio and vivace—or more subjective ones: Chicken dishes range from satisfy- ing—morsels sautéed with garlic and wine—to dreadful, such as the special chicken with sausage and peppers in a gelatinous sauce. . . . The limits in that sentence are “satisfy- ing” and “dreadful.” There is a top and a bottom. It is clear how they vary. But what is the nature of the limits in the ex- ample below, and in what way do items vary within them? They [items auctioned] ranged from unpublished pinup-style photographs of Marilyn Monroe, taken in 1945 , before she became a movie star, to a gold record awarded the Beatles in 1964 for the million-selling single “I Want to Hold Your Hand.” From the context, we cannot say that the items “ranged” in age or “ranged” in value between the photographs and the record. Then what was the essence of the limits and how did the items range within them? We can only guess. To complicate the guessing game, writers will often add a third supposed limit, or more. . . . For months the company had con- sidered more than 200 new names, ranging from U.S.S.A. and Amcor to Maxus. Do U.S.S.A. and Amcor together consti- tute some limit? Or is Amcor some no- table landmark on the way to Maxus? If the names extended, say, from “Amcor to Zilch,” the range would be clear. Now it is muddy. Extra limits may appear on the “to” side: These [problems] have ranged from high costs to traffic problems, a lack of police cooperation, antiquated equipment and a dearth of studio space. Or the limits may be equally divided be- tween the “from” and “to” sides: The company began a program to teach workers English—a step also taken by many other employers rang- ing from nursing homes and resort 356 range, true and false 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 356"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"hotels to insurance companies and manufacturers. Or any extra one may get its own “to”: Taking part . . . are prominent church figures from many countries, ranging from top Vatican officers to evangelist Billy Graham to the Arch- bishop of Canterbury. If things or people “range,” ask how? The last five preceding examples, from press articles, leave us wondering. The monstrous sentence below, from a book, seems to give the reader five pairs of lim- its to puzzle over. What makes any of them a “range”? As one examined the impressive range of Nixon’s initiatives—from his ap- propriation of the war-making power to his interpretation of the appointing power, from his unilateral determina- tion of social priorities to his unilat- eral abolition of statutory programs, from his attack on legislative privilege to his enlargement of executive privi- lege, from his theory of impoundment to his theory of the pocket veto, from his calculated disparagement of the cabinet and his calculated discrediting of the press to his carefully organized concentration of federal management in the White House—from all this a larger design ineluctably emerged. What if one could not examine that “range,” because its limits were hope- lessly obscure? Then, I guess, the larger design would not ineluctably (inevitably) emerge. If what follow “from” and “to” are arbitrary, if it is not obvious how things or people “range” within them, the de- vice has no reason for being. Often it can easily be replaced by a term like such as or including or among them and a series of examples. Such usage would have suited the second sentence of the news- paper passage below. Since East Germany’s founding, ad- vancing in the party hierarchy has meant access to a variety of privileges denied average citizens. At this point, a phrase like These have included or Among these have been would be useful. Instead, the old “range from” device is trotted out (in the wrong tense and with other peculiarities). These ranged from special housing, special stores where higher quality goods and foodstuffs were sold at lower prices to party members and Western goods could be ordered by mail, freedom to travel abroad, as well as use of Western luxury cars. By the end of the sentence, the beginning of the sentence is forgotten. We are never told what anything ranges to. 3. RANGING implied The word “range” or “ranging” often is left out but implied by “from . . . to . . . ,” as in this sentence from a schol- arly book: The eighteenth century was an age of dictionaries—dictionaries of all kinds, from horsemanship to mathematics. How do “all kinds” of dictionaries go “from horsemanship to mathematics”? Dictionaries normally go from A to Z. He used references from Michael Jackson to the Sundance Kid. . . . Why those two? Or does it mean that he (the president) quoted Michael Jackson referring to the Sundance Kid? Vice Mayor Han Boping told a news conference that prices of 1 , 800 non-staple foods from canned goods to steamed dumplings will rise. If any government decreed that “foods from canned goods to steamed range, true and false 357 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 357"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"dumplings shall rise in price,” there would be chaos in the land. Three variations follow. His commercial work . . . has ap- peared in reproduction in just about every graphic form imaginable, from billboards and calendars to album covers and playing cards. He [Aristotle] wrote on almost all subjects, from physics to literature, from politics to biology. Would it make any less sense if the first said “billboards and album covers to calendars and playing cards” and the second said “from physics to politics, from literature to biology”? Almost all seeds of economic impor- tance to man—from corn to cabbage to cowpeas—sit frozen in the Na- tional Seed Storage Laboratory’s room-sized freezer vaults. The function of the third “to” and whether only those seeds beginning with c are deemed of economic importance to man are among the questions raised by that journalistic aberration. 4. Stale expression: “EVERYTHING FROM” Once upon a time, a writer wrote a sentence like this: They dined on everything from cru- dites to cream puffs. It did not make sense—could you list “everything” between them?—but it was cute. “Everything from . . . to . . .” got to be a cliché, no longer cute and still sense- less. A variation might appear; according to a dictionary of English usage, jazz “used attributively . . . may be applied to anything from language to stockings” (but not to words from a to k and t to z? ). Within a twelve-day period, six writ- ers (three on one newspaper) wrote: ...A long list of speakers criticized everything from the party leadership to the organization of the conference. . . . Correspondents prepare stories on everything from Soviet tank battal- ions to the roots of the Russian Or- thodox church.

Meanwhile a U.S. president said in an address: These microcomputers today aid the design of everything from houses to cars to spacecraft. That should cover everything. RAPE.

Upon consuming some for dessert (not customarily the course in which they are served), a restaurant reviewer wrote that the “exquisite apricot raviolis and poppy-seed ice cream invariably hook you for a revisit.” Drop the s in “ravio- lis.” The noun ravioli already is plural. It comes from an Italian dialect in which ravioli is the plural of raviolo, meaning little turnip. Inasmuch as people do not commonly buy, cook, or even eat just one of them, the singular is not needed often. If it is needed, a piece of ravioli is preferable to “a ravioli.” Spaghetti, a plural word, should be treated similarly. RAZE. See DEMOLISH. REALLY. The adverb really deserves respect. It has a real meaning: actually, in fact, in reality, in truth. Instead, it was treated as an empty locution in a Sunday travel article about a place in Thailand. It’s another world really—a misty, mountainous and mysterious land of hill tribes, rice paddies, superb arti- sans, opium, flowers and beautiful women even Thais find remote and enchanting. Adding “really” to an obviously untrue statement ruined what would have been a passable metaphor. Another world really is a quarter-million miles away at the closest and not yet a topic for travel writers. Besides, is any of the enumer- ated features too exotic for the world we all know? ( See also PADDY. ) Informally, really can substitute for in- deed, serving as an intensive: “It has really been a pleasure.” Advertising makes liberal use of it. A pants maker has a farmer say: “They fit really good, feel really comfortable, and work really hard.” It does not use really wrong, just puffily. (What is bad is “good.” See GOOD and WELL. ) Those with modest vocabularies find the word useful, sometimes in tandem. In a radio program, a restaurant re- viewer said about a cheese cake: “It’s really really light. It’s really really good.” The phrase not really can be meaning- ful, contrasting reality with semblance: “It’s not really a lake that you see. It’s a mirage.” It can also be misleading ver- biage: Jack asks, “Has the package ar- rived?” Jill replies, “Not really.” All she may mean is no, but the response can sound equivocal.

As a trademark, Realtor ought to be capitalized, although some dictionaries and newspapers give it in lower case. Of- ten we do not know whether a writer or speaker is using the designation the strict way or loosely as a synonym for real es- tate broker. The difference can be signifi- cant, inasmuch as an objective of the association is the protection of the public from dishonest practices. realtor, realty 359 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 359"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"Taken from the noun realty, meaning real estate, or landed property, Realtor was coined by C.

Therefore a case can be made against pairing “reason” with why. It is like saying “the reason for the reason for which.” An example comes from a television forum. That’s one of the reasons why Dole might have plateaued out a bit. “Why” can be replaced with that: “That’s one of the reasons that Dole. . . . ” Often there is a choice. If you prefer 360 reason 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 360"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"to use the reason, it can be accompanied by that. “What is the reason that you sent me a new bill?” (not “the reason why”). / “Tell me the reason that she left so soon” (not “the reason why”). If you prefer to use why, “the reason” has no place: “Why did you send me a new bill?” / “Tell me why she left so soon.” Dictionaries differ on this point, and so do grammarians. While some consider “the reason why” redundant, some oth- ers call it an accepted colloquialism with a long history. But inasmuch as the phrase is not essential to the expression of any thought, it can easily be discarded (except in quoting those who have used it). In his poem “The Charge of the Light Brigade,” Alfred Lord Tennyson may have unwittingly encouraged the use of the phrase by writing: “Theirs not to make reply, / Theirs not to reason why, / Theirs but to do and die.” Note that he used reason as a verb, meaning to think through logically; not in the question- able way, as a noun, meaning explana- tion or justification. “The reason why . . . is because” com- pounds the redundancy. Example: “The reason why I can’t go to work today is because of my back injury.” Omit “The reason why” and “is.” Other redundant “reason” phrases are “the reason is due to” and “the rea- son is on account of.” Examples: “The reason for the price increase is due to higher costs” (omit either “The reason for” or “due to”) and “The reason that the game was called was on account of rain” (omit either “The reason that . . . was” or “on account of”). 3. “SIMPLE . . .”; “IT STANDS TO . . . ” “For the simple reason that” is a ques- tionable phrase. It may be unnecessary for those who find the reason obviously simple. Yet the “simple” can offend someone who did not know the reason, implying “You’re a dope for not know- ing this.” A book on language says: Nor can we read any Indo- European writings, for the simple rea- son that not a scrap exists. Although the explanation is “simple” in its brevity, the fact presented may not be obvious to the reader. Later the book says: English grammar is so complex and confusing for the one very simple rea- son that its rules and terminology are based on Latin—a language with which it has precious little in com- mon. This time the reason, though twice as long as the last one, is “very simple”; but the information is no more obvious. Another dubious expression is “It stands to reason.” With “that” added, it introduces the writer’s or the speaker’s opinion. It will sit well with the readers who agree with the opinion. To others, it can appear arrogant. See also OF COURSE, 3. 4. Superfluous “REASONS”? “I am resigning for personal reasons” is a satisfactory sentence. “The staff is being reduced for econ- omy reasons” is less satisfactory. Unlike personal, an adjective, economy is a noun; and although a noun can serve as an adjective if it has to, “for reasons of economy” would be a more normal ex- pression. Moreover, reasons is not essen- tial; the sentence makes sense without it. A comparable example: “We are keeping this information confidential for national security reasons.” Better: “. . . for reasons of national security.” Still better: “. . . for national security.” (Our concern here is only style, not sub- stance.) REBUT and REFUTE. To rebut is to oppose a statement or argument with contrary evidence or argument. “The rebut and refute 361 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 361"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"chair will allow the lady five minutes to rebut the gentleman’s statement.” Using rebut (verb, transitive and intransitive; pronounced rih-BUT) does not imply a judgment of who is right or wrong. To refute something is to prove it wrong or false. “The Ptolemaic theory of Earth as the stationary center of the uni- verse was refuted by Copernicus and Galileo.” Using refute (verb, transitive; pronounced rih-FYOOT) declares in ef- fect that the original statement, belief, or allegation has been proven wrong or false. An almanac misused the word: The “character issue” stemmed from allegations of infidelity, which Clinton ultimately refuted in a television inter- view in which he and Hillary avowed their relationship was solid. It may reasonably be said that he rebut- ted the allegations but not that he “re- futed” them. In that interview, he denied a woman’s statement that they had en- gaged in an affair. Six years later, in sworn testimony, he admitted having had an affair with the woman. RECOMMIT. See COMMIT. RECORD. “You’re well on your way today to setting new records,” a televi- sion quizmaster told three contestants, who had amassed substantial scores. If records will be set, we can assume they will be “new” records. One might speak of a new record when comparing it with an old record. “All-time record” is often redundant, although it might be apt in contrast with, say, “a modern-day record” or “a record for the century.” RE-CREATION and RECRE- ATION.

When we consider that generations of teachers have been instructing youngsters that regardless is correct and “irregardless” is incorrect, even illiterate, it is somewhat surprising to find an occasional educated person using the substandard word. A physician said on a television news program, “We’re obligated to do that biopsy irregardless of the physical find- ings.” Of course regardless was the word to use. A minister said on a radio talk show, about a sectarian movement in the news, “We have to voice our opinion, irregard- less of some of the positive things that are going on.” Regardless. “Irregardless” should be shunned for good reason. It has two negatives. The prefix, “ir-,” tends to cancel out the suf- fix, “-less.” See Double negative. Nowadays regardless is commonly used as an adverb. Often, with of follow- ing, it means without regard for or in spite of. This sentence is typical: “I will have it regardless of the high cost.” It would not be wrong to end that sentence with regardless if the high cost was un- derstood from the context. Regardless as an adjective is found in old literature. It might mean showing no regard, heedless, or careless; for exam- ple, “With a book he was regardless of time” ( Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen). It might also mean paid no re- gard, that is, no notice or attention; or shown no regard in the sense of consid- eration or respect. 362 recommit 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 362"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"REGULATION, STATUTE, and L AW. Although a governmental regu- lation and a statute both have the force of law, they should not be confused, as they were in an article: ...A Federal Communications Commission regulation . . . says any- one in a region where an area code overlay exists is required to dial the area code for all local calls. . . . It is not surprising that Nynex is itself seeking relief from an onerous statute. If it is an FCC regulation, it is not a statute. The first is a rule issued by a public administrative agency. The sec- ond is a law enacted by Congress or a state legislature and approved by the president or a governor. A statute may present the basic principles of a law and leave the fine details —regulations— to a particular agency. The Food and Drug Administration adopted a regulation (to be enforced by states) that required identification for to- bacco purchasers looking younger than twenty-seven. A newspaper reported the news without telling of a new regulation. The text called it an FDA “crackdown.” The headline said, “Teen Smokers Strike Out Under New Law.” Neither was wrong in essence, but neither was pre- cise. To speak of a law is customarily to speak of a statute, rather than a regula- tion. There are both federal and state laws; a municipal law is called an ordi- nance. Law or the law may be used in a gen- eral sense to mean the official rules that govern people. The law of the United States consists of the Constitution, acts of Congress, treaties, and court rulings. The law of each state is its constitution, legislative acts, and court rulings. Regulation may be used in a general sense to mean governmental direction or control (e.g., “regulation of utilities”). RELATE. To relate, as a transitive verb, is to tell (“She related an anec- dote”) or to bring into a reasonable as- sociation (“He related ancient history to current events”). As an intransitive verb meaning to have a connection or relationship (to something), relate goes back about four centuries. (“The critic eye . . . examines bit by bit: How parts relate to parts, or they to whole”—Pope.) What is rather new, and questionable, is the popular adoption of a jargonistic use of the in- transitive relate. To psychologists and social workers, it has meant to get along, interact, have similar ideas, and so on. (“Alice does not relate well with her classmates.”) A newspaper column described an er- roneous change made in an author’s work and commented, “Not pointing any fingers, but your columnist can re- late.” To end there, without indicating the relationship, is to be parsimonious with information. REMAP. To map an area, feature, or journey is to represent it or chart it on a map. To remap it is to map it again. It is a word that the general public has little need for. Headline writers need it as a synonym for reapportion or reappor- tionment. It has slopped over into the bodies of articles. A political report said state sen- ators of one party wanted “to keep the legislative primary in June, when the new remap plan would be ready” (rather than switch to March and run in old dis- tricts, favoring the other party). Except for headlines, there is no ex- cuse for remap instead of reappor- tion(ment). The two are not the same; as any cartographer knows, changing a map need have nothing to do with changing the distribution of legislative seats. REMUNERATION and RENU- MERATION.

It was the wrong noun. Remuneration, pronounced re- myoon-uh-RAY-shun, is compensation, reward, or pay for work, service, loss, etc. A related adjective, remunerative, means providing remuneration, prof- itable. Think of money. Renumeration, re-new-muh-RAY- shun, a word that is seldom used except by mistake, means a new numeration. A numeration is a numbering, counting, or calculation, or a system of numbering. Think of numbers. Repetition and its avoidance.

REPORT, REPORTED, REPORT- EDLY. See ACCUSED, ALLEGED (etc.). RESPECTABLE and RESPECT- FUL. In a network telecast from New Hampshire, a news reporter said, “The Cuomo campaign has got to break into the double digits to be respectful.” The last word should have been the adjective respectable meaning worthy of respect or having a good reputation. The other adjective, respectful, means showing or characterized by respect or deference. “The boy was respectful to his elders.” RESPECTIVE, RESPECTIVELY. Respectively is useful in this sentence: “Mr. Graham and Miss Harrison teach boys and girls respectively.” It tells us that Mr. Graham teaches boys and Miss Harrison teaches girls. Without respec- tively one could suppose that each teacher teaches both boys and girls. Re- spectively indicates that each one in a se- ries pertains, in the same order, to a particular one in another series. In a column on presidential politics, two series that are supposed to jibe “re- spectively” do not: Earlier, senators Estes Kefauver and Eugene McCarthy and Robert Ken- nedy helped retire Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson, respectively, with primary fights. The first series contains three names. The second series contains only two. Those who are not versed in the appropriate political history cannot know how to match them. The sentence should have been reworded, without “respectively,” perhaps like this: Earlier, Senator Estes Kefauver helped retire Harry Truman with a primary fight, and Senators Eugene McCarthy and Robert Kennedy did the same to Lyndon Johnson. The sentence below would make sense without respectively. It makes no sense with it. The first quarter and third quarter re- spectively are the best seasons for tele- vision response, just as they are for print and mail. What the author (of a book on market- ing) meant to convey is obscure. The quarters seem to be equated. Nor does respective serve any clear function in the next sentence, uttered by a mayor. This is a private-public partnership, benefits to flow to each one of the re- spective parties. 364 repetition and its avoidance 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 364"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"Writers sometimes use respectively (adverb) or respective (adjective) when the respectiveness is obvious: “Michael and Alice will play the parts of Romeo and Juliet respectively.” / “The ambas- sadors from Britain and France returned to their respective countries.” Examples of more informative use: “Mr. and Mrs. Palmer serve as the chair- man and treasurer respectively.” / “The two defense attorneys are conferring with their respective clients” (not collec- tively).

Reverend is a description, an ad- jective meaning worthy of reverence. Of course, not all clerics are so worthy, but we traditionally give them the benefit of the doubt. Reverend is comparable to the Hon- orable (or Hon. ) that is often affixed to the names of public officials. Neither word is properly a noun. Just as a public official is not an “honorable,” a clergy- man is not a “reverend.” ( See also HONORABLE, HONORARY, HON- ORED, 1. ) A magazine and a newspaper were wrong: The reverend spoke only for a mo- ment. . . . But the reverend himself in- sists the young candidate . . . is now on his own. The only person who offered him any help was a big-bellied reverend. . . . The New York Post ran a front-page photograph of the roly-poly reverend under a hair dryer. Call him a churchman, a clergyman, a cleric, an ecclesiastic, a minister, a pastor, a preacher, a priest (if he is Catholic or Episcopal), or any of several other desig- nations, depending on his faith, but do not call him a “reverend” if you want to be proper. In referring to him, use Reverend or, better, the Reverend, only with a full name or title; for example, the Reverend Joseph Cole, not “the Reverend Cole.” We would not speak of a senator as “the Honorable Adams,” nor would we ad- dress him as “Honorable Adams.” In writing, the Rev. may be used as an ab- breviation. After the first mention, it is correct to use the Reverend (or the Rev. ) Mr. Cole or the Reverend Dr. Jones (if he is a doc- tor of divinity) or simply Mr. Cole or Dr. Jones, for instance. He may be addressed as Mr. or Dr. Some clergymen may be re- ferred to and addressed as, e.g., Father Williams or Pastor Robinson. It was improper to say that “the Rev- erend Jackson has been able to broaden his base” or to write that “he disputed the time frame recalled by the Reverend Sparks. . . . ” Correction: “the Reverend Mr. Jackson” and “the Reverend Mr. Sparks.” Another correct way is exem- reverend 365 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 365"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"plified by a New York Times article that referred to “The Rev.

What is wrong with “ Mr. Jackson”? The minister who tells us, “I’m Reverend Brown,” instead of, “I’m Mr. Brown, the minister,” or “I’m Pastor Brown,” lacks both humility and (worse yet) verbal propriety. It distressed a pastor’s wife that people addressed him too informally in their correspondence. She wrote to a syndicated etiquette columnist, who ad- vised using note cards printed with the heading “The Reverend and Mrs. William Smith.” But that would be wrong, for Mr. Smith’s title would then be left out. “The Reverend Mr. and Mrs. William Smith” or “ Pastor and Mrs. William Smith” would suit a letterhead. Being an adjective, Reverend properly has no plural, unlike the noun Mister or Mr., whose plural is Messrs. Disregard “Revs. Brown and Smith.” Reversal of meaning. 1. Negatives. 2. Other examples. 3. Reasons. 1. Negatives Sometimes a writer, speaker, or editor does not say what he intended to say. He may say the very opposite. Negatives—too many or too few—are among the sources of danger. A news agency’s dispatch from Cleve- land, about an indictment of guardsmen in an infamous case, appeared this way in print: The grand jury charged the eight defendants willfully assaulted and in- timidated the student demonstrators by firing weapons in their direction, violating their constitutional right to be deprived of liberty without due process of law. The sentence affirms a “right to be de- prived of liberty.” To invoke the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, insert not before “to be deprived.” A court of appeals reversed a decision in a civil case, and then a newspaper re- versed the appellate decision by leaving out one word: In finding that The Post did commit libel, the court rejected a number of arguments raised by Mr. Tavoular- eas’s lawyers. “Did commit” should be “did not com- mit. . . . ” (The mistake was not crucial, inasmuch as the headline and lead para- graph summarized the decision. See also NOT, 1F .) In a statement attributed to an Egyp- tian official, a positive form is mistaken for a negative form. He promotes popu- lation control, but some citizens are une- ducated: “So what I propagate falls on deaf ears. . . . We have a problem with the literate and semi-literate.” The quotation has him saying in effect that those who read and write pose a problem. No doubt “literate” should be illiterate. The speaker may have had dif- ficulty expressing himself in English. The reporter could well have paraphrased the statement and corrected it, unless the error escaped him too. That a reporter quoted someone accu- rately is no excuse for the publication of a topsy-turvy statement. Regardless of origin, it reflects on both the quoter and the quoted. If one is not careful, something and nothing can be confused.

He asked rhetorically: Isn’t that why you go to a doctor, to make sure that small chance that it’s nothing awful? The simplest correction would replace “small” with large or good. Better: “. . . to exclude that small chance that it’s something awful?” The next sentence was part of a stock market report on the radio: No one appeared panicky, predicting this is just a small glitch in a bull mar- ket. No one is the subject of both appeared (verb) and predicting (present partici- ple). The speaker literally reported “No one . . . predicting. . . . ” Better: “No one appeared panicky. The prevailing view was that. . . . ” (Aside from the problem of the negative subject, “predicting this is” is dubious. To predict is to foresee the future, not to describe the present.) The final example in this section is a rhetorical blunder by Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago. After a riot near the Democratic national convention, he held a press conference to defend the police against allegations of brutality toward protesters. The confrontation was not created by the police. The confrontation was cre- ated by the people who charged the police. Gentlemen, get the thing straight, once and for all. The police- man isn’t there to create disorder. The policeman is there to preserve disor- der. He probably wanted to say “preserve or- der. ” Instead he emphasized the wrong word and repeated the negative “dis-.” The possibility of reversing one’s meaning inadvertently by using two or more negatives in a sentence is treated in Double negative, 2. These are some other hazards: • “And” instead of but following a negative. See BUT, 1. • As with a negative. See AS, 4. • But with “that” or with a negative. See BUT, 2, 3. • Not with another negative, e.g., not or un-. See NOT, 1G; PROOF- READ, PROOFREADING. • Which used vaguely following a negative. See WHICH, 1. 2. Other examples A congressman is indirectly quoted here on the subject of drugs in public housing projects. However, Representative Charles B. Rangel . . . said many drug dealers were known to the tenants but were intimidated by them. As published, the statement says the drug dealers were intimidated by the ten- ants. Changing the end of the sentence yields a more plausible message: “. . . but intimidated them” or “. . . but the tenants were intimidated by them.” A newspaper headline said, “Assem- bly barely defeats bill easing water pollu- tion.” In announcing that a majority of state assemblymen had declined to alle- viate water pollution, the headline re- versed the meaning of the news story underneath it. The defeated bill would have relaxed a statute against polluters of state waterways. “Assembly barely defeats bill to ease pollution law ” would have been accurate (and fit the space available for the headline).

To write a headline saying “Cuomo Can Blame America’s New Slavery On the Republicans’ Neglect of the Poor,” an editor probably had to be ( 1 ) igno- rant of who William F. Buckley was and ( 2 ) unable to grasp irony and mockery. (Let us charitably discount the possibil- ity of bias.) In answering a pro- Democratic speech delivered at Gettysburg, Buckley asked rhetorically in a column: Whose fault is the new slavery? You guessed it: It is the fault of the Re- publican Party. From which it follows, does it not, that if Abe Lincoln were alive today, he would be a Democrat? After stating the neglect-of-the-poor charges, most of the column presented statistics meant to show the poor im- proving economically. Changing “Can” to Can’t and putting quotation marks around “New Slavery” would have patched up the headline. But proper por- trayal of the columnist’s views required a rewrite, such as this: “Poor People Are Faring Better, Despite Cuomo’s ‘New Slavery’ Talk.” Television showed a demonstration against Senator Dole during his presi- dential election campaign. A newscaster said the protesters objected to “Dole’s backing of a ban on assault rifles.” A factually correct version would have been “Dole’s backing of a bill to repeal the ban on assault rifles.” 3. Reasons To offer a general explanation for such reversals would be guessing. Are they caused by absent-mindedness, care- lessness, haste, inattention, lack of thought, misunderstanding, or a mis- chievous goblin? The first section deals with trouble- some negatives. The second displays three patterns. First, a passive verb is confused with an active verb. Then a crucial noun is left out: law or decision. Last, ignorance of the views of a person- age, Buckley or Dole, is displayed.

Its grandfather was the Latin revertere, a product of re-, back, and vertere, turn. Back is implied in revert. To revert to old ways, a former belief, a past situation, or a topic that came up before is to go back to it. In law, revert applies to property or money; it means to go back to a former owner. 368 reverse 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 368"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"In television programs, a member of a panel and an interviewer had these ques- tions: “What’s going to happen when Hong Kong reverts back to China?” And when youths go home to hostile lands after camping together, “Don’t they simply revert back to who they were?” Revert(s) without “back” would have been enough each time. REVOLT and REVOLUTION. When Boris Yeltsin ordered the Russian parliament disbanded, some members and sympathizers rebelled and were crushed by forces loyal to Yeltsin. A newspaper’s main headline read, “Bloody end to latest revolution in Rus- sia.” “Revolution” was the wrong word. A revolution is an overthrow of a political system, or a forcible replacement of a ruler or ruling group, or the seizure of power by a militant group, in each case by forces within the country involved. (In a broader sense, any great social change may be called a revolution; for example, the industrial revolution. ) The French Revolution, the American Revo- lution, the Russian Revolution (in 1917 )—those were indeed revolutions. Power was seized; the old regimes were overthrown; new governments were set up. In Russia in 1993 , rebels failed in their attempt to overthrow Yelsin’s rule, therefore no “revolution” took place. To be sure, there was a revolt, a rebellion, an insurrection, an uprising. Each noun denotes a violent attempt to overthrow a government. (Those terms, most commonly revolt, are used at times to describe nonviolent opposition move- ments. “California’s Proposition 13 rep- resented a revolt by taxpayers.”) Of course, any such violent attempt at an overthrow may succeed; at that point the revolt, rebellion, etc. may be called a rev- olution. Two related words are coup d’état (pronounced coo-day-TAH), a violent overthrow that is sudden, unexpected, and brought about by a small military group; and putsch (pronounced some- thing like push but with a t in the mid- dle), an attempted coup d’état.

When cowboys round up cattle, they bring the animals together in a herd. Round up in two words is a verb. The process or act of herding the cat- tle is a roundup. (In ranching, the herded cattle also are called a roundup, and so are the cowboys and horses used in the process.) Roundup in one word is a noun. The terms are not limited to ranch ac- tivity. The police may round up suspects. Legislators may be rounded up for vot- ing. Any act of rounding up animals or people could be called a roundup. In writing a headline saying “Israelis flatten guerrilla base; roundup Shiite males in Tyre,” a copy editor wrongly chose the noun, “roundup,” instead of the verb, round up. RUIN and RUINS. Ruins can usu- ally be seen. They are the remains of something that was built but now is de- stroyed or decayed. “They discovered the ruins of an ancient temple.” / “The temple is in ruins.” The singular, ruin, may describe the same thing as ruins, that which is de- stroyed or decayed. “The town is now a ruin.” / “The mansion has gone to ruin.” Often, though, it is used in a more ab- stract sense. Ruin can refer to the cause (“Fire was its ruin”) or to the action, condition, or process (“They witnessed the ruin of the economy”). The singular would have been more idiomatic in a column: “. . . Both [sena- tors] had good reputations[,] now on the verge of ruins.” Make it ruin. If the de- struction were complete, “now in ruins ” would be an acceptable metaphor. An al- ternative to ruin in the more abstract sense is ruination. Ruin is pronounced either ROO-in or ROO-n. See also DEMOLISH. RULE, RULING. In a legal sense, to rule is to decide judicially, and a ruling is an official decision by a court or judge or an authorized body. The words are used inappropriately in the excerpts below. This is from a daily newspaper: The city attorney ruled that the council could not be bound in the fu- ture by its current intent to put char- ter reform on the . . . ballot. A weekly in another city asked whether the city attorney there would receive a vote of confidence despite his recent high-handed . . . rulings?. . . . [He] has ruled in seemingly contradic- tory ways at various times. [And so on. “Ruled” or “ruling(s)” appears six more times.] Unlike a judge, an attorney for either a public or private entity does not “rule” or make “rulings.” He gives opinions. A court may rule otherwise. Some commissions rule too, but their staffs do not. A dispatch by a news agency began loosely: The staff of the Federal Communi- cations Commission ruled in favor of CBS yesterday on a complaint by five major Protestant churches. . . . The next paragraph summarized what was fitly termed a “staff opinion.” Rule (verb, transitive and intransitive) can also mean to decree, govern, or dominate. RUN and RAN.

The Ameri- can verb is run, not “stand.” Unless the writer was new to the United States and unfamiliar with its idiom, her motivation for a usage so strange to American eyes and ears is obscure. See also Pronouns, 3. RUN AWAY and RUNAWAY. A newspaper’s TV guide listed, among scheduled programs, “Runaway With the Rich and Famous.” If the program had dealt with a child fleeing from home, runaway (noun) might be right. How- ever, inasmuch as the program urged watchers to run away (verb), the two words should have been kept separate. RUN-OFF. See MAJORITY, 1. Run-on sentence. 1. Classical run- ons. 2. Comma faults. 1. Classical run-ons A computer company climaxed a magazine ad in this way: “They build more than computers they build rela- tionships.” Signs throughout vehicles of a city’s transit system say, “PLEASE HOLD ON SUDDEN STOPS NECESSARY.” Those are run-on sentences. A run-on sentence is like two (or more) sentences glued together, end to end. Each is an in- dependent clause; that is, it has a subject and verb and could stand alone as an in- dependent sentence. Right now the two are illegitimately paired, neither separate nor properly joined. They should be ei- ther granted full independence as two sovereign sentences or united by means of due punctuation. A semicolon (;) or a dash (—) would unite them properly. Separated: “They build more than computers. They build relationships.” / “PLEASE HOLD ON. SUDDEN STOPS NECESSARY.” (Better: “SUD- DEN STOPS ARE NECESSARY.”) Joined: “They build more than com- puters; they build relationships.” Or “They build more than computers—they build relationships.” A colon (:) could be used for punctuation instead. Any of those marks would fit the transit notice. 2. Comma faults A common form of run-on (which some classify as a separate defect) is the comma fault, also known as the comma splice. It purports to make a comma the punctuation between two independent clauses. A comma cannot handle the job. It neither separates nor joins the two clauses adequately. The first example is from a main news story: In 1949 Gov. Alfred E. Driscoll, a Republican, offered him a seat on the New Jersey Superior Court, he grate- fully accepted. One way to correct the example is to change the third comma to a period and make the last three words a separate sen- tence. A second way is to change that comma to a semicolon. A third way is to substitute a conjunction, namely and. Similarly, the comma is inadequate in this snippet from a magazine article: Catholics didn’t sing, everyone knew that. Split it into two three-word sentences or swap the comma for a semicolon or dash. run-on sentence 371 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 371"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"The failure to stop a sentence properly can produce ambiguity: “I just can’t stand the noise, from seven in the morning until quitting time it’s driving me crazy,” said Dee. . . .

SAHARA. “When I awoke we were above the Sahara Desert,” an author wrote. Another wrote, “. . . Imagine yourself engaged in an amateur archaeo- logical dig somewhere in the Sahara Desert.” That is the popular name that speakers of English give to the largest desert on earth, comprising 3 . 5 million square miles in northern Africa. It is not a serious lapse to use the phrase, though some find it redundant. Sahara is not a typical geographical name, like Bering (Sea) or Falkland (Is- lands), imposed on a particular feature to distinguish it from others of its kind. It never had a special name. Sahara means desert in Arabic. (Arabs stress the sa or ra, depending on regional dialect. We stress the ha. ) Inasmuch as most of us English speakers consider it just a name and few of us know Arabic, “Sahara Desert” should not offend many ears or eyes. No one seems to object to “Gobi Desert,” though gobi is a Mongolian term for a desert. But those who wish to be scrupu- lous in referring to the Sahara—or the Gobi—may omit “Desert.” Similarly, “River” and “Mountains” may be omit- ted from mentions of the Rio Grande and the Sierra Nevada in recognition of the Spanish terms. ( Río: river. Sierra: rocky mountain range.) And “Mount” need not preface Fujiyama, in Japan, though Mount Fuji will do. Sometimes sahara, in lower case, means a desert in general: “If the soil is not cared for, fertile farm land can turn into a sahara.” Used in that way, sahara is certainly enough.

In a television program on rescues, a policeman told of “a child who had been scolded by hot water.” Sorry, Officer; you got it wrong. The child was scalded. To scald (verb), rhyming with called, is to burn someone with hot water or steam (transitive) or to be burned by it (intransitive). To scold (verb, transitive and intransitive), rhyming with told, is to criticize adversely and angrily. A scald (noun) is an injury caused by scalding. A scold (noun) is one who scolds often. SCAN. Using and interpreting scan (verb, transitive) requires caution, for it has two contradictory meanings. Its strict meaning is to examine closely, carefully, and systematically; to scruti- nize. This is correct: Astronomers scanning the sky through the Hubble Space Telescope have detected and photographed an object far beyond our solar system that appears to be a runaway giant planet. . . . A modern, popular meaning of scan is to look at or read quickly and superfi- cially: “I bought the paper, but I’ve only had time to scan the headlines.” That is one meaning of skim (verb, transitive and intransitive). Perhaps whoever started using scan in that way was con- fusing the two words. Trouble can arise when the context does not indicate which meaning of scan is intended: “Harris, scan this report and tell me what you think of it.” Whether the boss wants his employee to study the report or glance at it is not clear. The strict meaning of scan harmo- nizes with a technical sense: to beam electrons, light, or sound in a systematic pattern for transmission, reproduction, or reflection. Scan also means to analyze the meter and rhythm of verse. That is the oldest sense of the word; pertinent quotations in The Oxford English Dic- tionary begin with one from 1398 using scanne. (In those last two senses, the verb can be transitive or intransitive.) The Oxford does not recognize the newer, popular use. Webster’s Third does.

SECOND. A second of time is a 60 th of a minute or a 3 , 600 th part of an hour, strictly speaking. One learns not to take that noun literally all the time, perhaps after someone on the telephone has is- sued an order to “hold on a second.” Using the word for a moment, a short while, minutes, or hours can be absurd, particularly when a more exact unit of time is specified. In a TV discussion, this was said: “Apparently at the last second, hours before the [scheduled] announce- ment, the president changed his mind” (about giving needles to drug addicts). The panelist would have done well with- out “at the last second.” SEEING EYE. Seeing Eye is a trade- mark and therefore should be capital- ized. Often it is not; a syndicated column refers vaguely to “an outfit that trained seeing-eye dogs. . . . ” The only outfit that has ever trained Seeing Eye dogs is The Seeing Eye, Inc., of Morristown, New Jersey. That institu- tion is the best-known trainer of dogs to lead blind people. If a dog has been trained elsewhere for the job or if you do not know whether such a dog is a Seeing Eye, then call it a guide dog or a dog guide or any doggone thing that describes it except “seeing-eye dog.” SEEN and SAW.

Hundreds of hyphen- ated words are formed with self-, a com- bining form that has to do with the self, oneself, or itself. A few legitimate examples are the nouns self-control, self-defense, self-government, self- preservation, and self-service; and the adjectives self-confident, self-conscious, self-employed, self-reliant, and self- taught. When pertaining to inanimate objects, as in self-cleaning, self-closing, self-locking, self-loading, and self- sealing, the combining form means auto- matic or by itself. Self- is sometimes superfluous, notwithstanding dictionary definitions. It contributes nothing to the meaning when a man is described as “a self- confessed war criminal.” Omit “self-” and see if anything is lost in self- collected, self-conceited, self-poise, and many other combinations, some of them absurd: “His clan elders [in Soma- lia] . . . selected the same 33 -year-old son . . . to become the new president of Mr. Aidid’s self-proclaimed republic.” If it was proclaimed by Mr. Aidid, it was not “self-proclaimed,” i.e., proclaimed by itself. -SELF, -SELVES endings.

Senior and seniority stem from the Latin senex, old. So do senile and senil- ity, and in past centuries they merely meant aged and old age; moreover, they could be used approvingly: Writers re- ferred to “senile Maturity of Judge- ment” ( 1661 ) and “vigorous senility” ( 1822 ). In the mid-nineteenth century, dis- eases of lung, heart, and head began be- ing prefixed with senile: for instance, senile dementia. Eventually senile (adjec- tive) and senility (noun) took on a pejo- rative cast, pertaining to the infirmities thought to inevitably accompany old age, particularly mental incompetence. Today it is known that different indi- viduals age differently, that senility in the sense of mental deterioration is not an inevitable concomitant of aging, that some so-called senile behaviors are re- versible, and that some younger people suffer symptoms associated with aging that some extremely aged individuals do not. George Bernard Shaw and P. G. Wodehouse were writing plays and nov- els respectively in their nineties. The co- median George Burns lived to 100 and was entertaining the country nearly to the end. Sentence fragment. 1. In writing. 2. Verbless newscasts. 1. In writing Isolated phrases can be effective at times, particularly in belles-lettres and drama. This is from Romeo and Juliet: O lamentable day! . . . O woful time! . . . Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day! . . . O woe! O woful, woful, woful day! Turning those phrases into complete sen- tences (e.g., “It is a lamentable day”) would weaken, not strengthen, them. But most of Shakespeare’s writings ad- here to the norms of English sentence structure; and that is usually the best course for a writer, particularly in infor- mative prose. In general, nonfiction writers should strive to be clear, not to be literary. The information must flow smoothly from author to reader. An aborted sentence cuts off the flow. Sometimes newspapers and more of- ten newscasters use pieces of sentences, either through slovenliness or intention- ally for some kind of effect. The effect usually is to hinder, not help, the reader or listener. This is from a daily: About a half-hour had passed when police finally noticed that the paddy wagon was empty. Except for a fifth guy who just sat there staring at the hole. First we read that the wagon was empty—period. Then comes a sentence fragment telling us, in effect, that the previous message was untrue. The two pieces sorely need unification: “. . . the paddy wagon was empty, except for. . . . ” Normally a complete sentence has a subject (the doer of the action) and a predicate (what the subject does). But a subject and predicate may not be enough to make sense. A pair of authors wrote in an instruction manual for a computer program: Whereas the Exactly as typed option will save the word exactly as you in- put it. Selecting Remove takes the dis- played word out of the dictionary. Again two pieces cry for union. The opening fragment makes no sense alone; the conjunction “whereas” indicates that a more or less contrasting passage 376 sentence fragment 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 376"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"will follow later in the sentence. Change the first period to a comma and continue with “selecting. . . . ” A sentence fragment is also known as a phrase (particularly when it lacks a subject or a predicate), an incomplete sentence, and a cut-short sentence. It is roughly the opposite of a run-on sen- tence. Whereas the writer of the run-on does not know when to stop, it seems that the writer of the fragment does not know enough to go. ( See Run-on sen- tence. ) 2. Verbless newscasts Each of these four excerpts from radio newscasts has the same fault: “On Wall Street the Dow Jones up. . . . ” / “An un- manned rocket set to lift off at the Cape Canaveral Air Force station this evening.” / “A Fairfield police officer clinging to life after five hours of surgery.” / “A hostage situation continu- ing in the San Bernardino area.” Each lacks a verb, at least an auxil- iary. ( See Verbs. ) The thoughts as broad- cast are incomplete; listeners may be thrown off track, prepared for such completed sentences as these: “An un- manned rocket set to lift off at the Cape Canaveral Air Force station this evening has burned up ”; or “A Fairfield police officer clinging to life after five hours of surgery has lost his fight. ” Numerous additional examples of sloppy, verbless newscasting could be cited. A simple is would rescue each of the four samples from fragmentation: “. . . The Dow Jones is up. . . . ” / “An unmanned rocket is set. . . . ” / “A Fair- field police officer is clinging. . . . ” / “A hostage situation is continuing. . . . ” Other verbs could strengthen those sentences: “the Dow Jones rose . . . ”; the “rocket lifts off . . .”; the “officer clings to life . . .”; the “hostage situation con- tinues. . . . ” A newscaster announced on a radio network: “Jeffrey Dahmer, convicted of murder three years ago, murdered him- self in a Wisconsin prison.” The an- nouncement was momentarily puzzling, raising the question of how someone could murder himself. The newscaster (or writer) had left out was or has been before “murdered”; it took over as an active verb, creating an absurdity. See also Punctuation, 2C (colons and verbless writing).

Finding such a question on an intelligence test, most writers and editors would have no problem with it. Yet we constantly read or hear series just as il- logical as that one. Take this sentence, from a syndicated column: She studied English, Yiddish, He- brew, and married a man who had money. That is typical. The writer enumerates a series of nouns (such as languages that someone studied) and then—without properly concluding the series—switches abruptly to a verb (an action of hers). Sometimes a series of adjectives shifts to a verb, or a series of verbs shifts to a clause, or a series is inconsistent in some other way. Let us define a series as an enumera- tion, a list, or a set of grammatically series errors 377 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 377"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"equal words or phrases. (The plural form of the word is the same: many se- ries. ) Within a sentence, a conjunction, like and, commonly appears before the final item in a series. When we read or listen to an enumeration of items, and leads us to expect one more item. Thus, the sample sentence is corrected in this way: “She studied English, Yid- dish, and Hebrew and married. . . . ” The added and ties the languages to- gether. They make up a series of nouns. More precisely, the nouns may be con- sidered a subseries; the main series con- sists of the verbs “studied” and “married,” linked together by the sec- ond “and.” (The marriage part remains irrelevant, but at least the sentence now is grammatical. The third comma be- comes superfluous.) This is a warning on cigarette pack- ages: Smoking Causes Lung Cancer, Heart Disease, Emphysema, And May Complicate Pregnancy. The notice enumerates three maladies (nouns) that smoking causes. Seeing “And,” we expect a fourth and last mal- ady, e.g., “Complications of Pregnancy.” Instead, the verb “May Complicate” ap- pears. It can stay if we end the series of nouns right: “. . . Heart Disease, And Emphysema. . . . ” (Why All The Capi- tals?) This is from a prominent newspaper: State court Judge Lawrence Weiss Friday sentenced Mr. B—— to 10 years in state prison, 18 months in county jail and fined him more than $ 46 , 000 . . . . The “and” leads us to expect that one more comparable item will follow: “. . . 10 years in state prison, 18 months in county jail, and a fine of more than $ 46 , 000 . . . . ” The writer started out enumerating punishments (nouns), then switched to what a judge did (verb). To keep the final part of the original sen- tence, the series of nouns must be duly concluded: “. . . 10 years in state prison and 18 months in county jail. . . . ” ( See also ON, 1. ) The derailment of a series ranks high among the most common errors found in print. The main cause of it is the fear of repetition, even the repetition of so in- offensive a word as and. The little con- junction intimidates many writers. They seem to think they are rationed to one and per sentence. Just what cataclysmic events do they think would ensue if they transgressed that limit? Repetition in the pursuit of clarity is no vice. The detriment from avoiding the and far outweighs any conceivable ad- vantage. A disorderly series is as discom- forting as an ill-fitting garment. What is worse: it can be confusing, as we will see in 2. B. More shifts of nouns Four more examples of a nouns-to- verb switch (from another prominent newspaper) follow below. The simplest way to repair the sentences is to replace each comma with and. . . . He has brought shame to himself, scandal to his industry and shattered the legend of a man whose financial skills seemed invincible. Mr. Itsuki . . . has sold 20 million singles, 4 million LP’s and has a 15 , 000 -member fan club. . . . . . . One must do 20 pull-ups with the feet never touching the ground, 80 sit- ups in two minutes with the feet held down and run three miles in 18 min- utes. Below we have a shift from one cate- gory of nouns to another. “And” already 378 series errors 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 378"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"appears twice. The thought of a third may be too much for an and- fearing writer. . . . The report was based on informa- tion from archives in the United States, Yugoslavia and “submissions and documents provided by Mr. Waldheim.” The main series consists of “information from archives . . . and ‘submissions and documents. . . . ’ ” Neither “and” has anything to do with the and needed in the subseries ensuing from “archives in.” The subseries is “the United States and Yugoslavia.” Amid the 1 , 550 largely impeccable pages of a general dictionary, under past participle, we find the sentence below, in which a series of nouns shifts to a prepo- sitional phrase. The meaning is clear, but the lapse stands out in a dictionary that normally is strong in matters of grammar. It is used as a verbal adjective in phrases such as finished work, baked beans, and with auxiliaries to form the passive voice or perfect and plu- perfect tenses in constructions such as The work was finished and She had baked the beans. Replace the first comma with and. The second comma may then be deleted. C. Shift of adjectives to verb He’s capable, honest, intelligent, dull and tries too hard. That press example and the four below display the same, incorrect form. There is a series of two verbs: an auxiliary verb (“is” or “was”) and an active verb (e.g., “tries”). They are connected by “and.” The first verb goes with a subseries of adjectives (“capable” etc.), which abruptly shifts to the second verb. To correctly complete the enumera- tion of things that the subject is or was, insert and before “dull” in the example above; in the four below, replace each comma with and. The and needed to connect the adjectives has nothing to do with the existing “and” that connects the verbs. He was jobless, strapped for cash and owed $ 12 , 000 to friends and rela- tives. ...Am eche is charming, gracious and still sports the pencil-thin moustache. . . . . . . It was modern, very well con- structed and enjoyed a panoramic Bay view. . . . The weapon is six inches long, bat- tery-powered and can deliver a charge of up to 40 , 000 volts. D. Skewed verb series One phrase is out of place in this sen- tence (from a New York newspaper): The House provisions would re- strict American nuclear tests, weapons production, ban anti- satellite tests in space and curb money for the President’s ‘Star Wars’ research program. . . . The three verbs, “restrict . . . ban . . . curb,” all pertaining to “would,” are in- consistent with the noun “weapons pro- duction.” The noun hangs there senselessly, although it was meant to per- tain to “restrict.” Either insert a verb— e.g., “ hold back weapons production” —or insert an and to complete the sub- series “nuclear tests and weapons pro- duction.” In addition, “American” is illogically applied to only one item; any- way it is unnecessary in a story about bills in the American Congress. (The series errors 379 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 379"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"quotation marks around “Star Wars” should be double. Single marks would be right in a British publication. See Punctu- ation, 10. ) In each of the examples below (from the same newspaper and two books), an enumeration of verbs abruptly shifts to an independent clause (that is, a part of a sentence that could be a sentence itself). Place and in front of “pays” and “bank” and the first “put.” The job of mayor carries little in the way of patronage, pays only $ 5 , 000 a year and the incumbent . . . is always under political pressure. To stay alive, you have to be able to hold out against equilibrium, main- tain imbalance, bank against entropy, and you can only transact this busi- ness with membranes in our kind of world. He [Johnson] read these [books], un- derlined words, put initials in the margins as cues, and his copyists put the words and the sentences in which they occurred on slips of papers. Again, the single “and” is not enough. Its only function is to connect the inde- pendent clause (beginning “the incum- bent is” or “you can only transact” or “and his copyists put”) to the rest of the sentence. Another and is still needed to complete the series of things that “the job of mayor” does or that “you have to be able to” do or that Johnson did. The next sentence begins enumerating verbs and suddenly shifts to nouns: . . . The metal can damage the central nervous system, cause hearing loss, lowered intelligence, and irritabil- ity. . . . The main series comprises “damage . . . and cause. . . . ” The final example in this section fails to separate passive verbs from an active verb. He will make “Biko” . . . about the controversial black leader (Steven Biko) who was arrested, imprisoned and subsequently died in jail. “Was” applies only to “arrested and im- prisoned.” The and needed to join that subseries of two passive verbs has noth- ing to do with the “and” linking it to the active verb, “died.” Verbs, 5, deals with a shortage of ob- jects, which may be accompanied by a shortage of conjunctions, in a verb se- ries. 2. Confusion and distortion It [epinephrine] is employed therapeu- tically as a vasoconstrictor, cardiac stimulant, and to relax bronchioles. If a lay reader of that excerpt from a medical dictionary concludes that two purposes for the drug have been enumer- ated, it is understandable. The writer should have replaced the first comma with and, omitting the second comma. Using a comma instead of a needed con- junction can make it appear that the sec- ond item is part of or explaining the first when it is really separate from the first. In the next quotation, the lack of an and in the right place distorts the mean- ing. The phrases in question are all nouns. Without mentioning Democratic pres- idential nominee Michael Dukakis by name, Bush attacked his opponent’s lack of foreign policy experience, op- position to a missile defense program and U.S. aid for anti-communist in- surgencies, such as the Nicaraguan Contras. By logic and grammar, the sentence seems to be saying that Bush attacked 380 series errors 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 380"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"Dukakis’s aid for insurgencies. One who had not been following the issues could have so concluded with good reason. Af- ter all, a conjunction heralds the end of a series, and here is an and just before the last of three grammatically equal items, all apparently coming under “his oppo- nent’s.” Actually, there are only two main items: ( 1 ) “Lack of foreign policy experience” and ( 2 ) “opposition to a missile defense program and U.S. aid. . . . ” Place and between those two main items to rescue the sentence. For extra clarity, you could elaborate: e.g., “ and Dukakis’s opposition both to a missile defense program and to U.S. aid. . . . ” The next example is inconsistent in more than one way. In attempting to avoid repetition at all costs, the writer became mired in confusion. Between 1983 and 1985 , the town fined Ocean Spray $ 7 , 800 , $ 6 , 600 in 1986 and will receive a a bill for $ 10 , 000 for 1987 . A correct sentence could say: “The town fined Ocean Spray $ 7 , 800 between 1983 and 1985 and $ 6 , 600 in 1986 and will give the company a bill of $ 10 , 000 for 1987 .” Presumably that is the meaning. The context provides no reason for the town’s giving the company money. Fur- thermore, starting the sentence with the phrase “Between 1983 and 1985 ” leads one to expect that it will carry over to other parts of the sentence. “The town,” the sentence’s subject, is what ought to carry over to other parts, specifically to a series of two verbs: one telling what the town did—“fined”—and the other telling what it “will” do. Under “fined” comes a subseries: “ 7 , 800 . . . and $ 6 , 600 .” 3. Inconsistency, unrelated to conjunc- tions In the example below from a quar- terly journal, the trouble does not lie in a conjunction. An enumeration of nouns is marred by the introduction of an adjec- tive. Terminology may vary slightly, but the news dimensions/attributes are generally agreed to be timeliness, proximity, prominence, impact, con- flict, magnitude, oddity and visual. Following seven nouns, from timeliness to oddity, the adjective “visual” is out of place. Instead, a noun, such as color or pictorialness (or whatever the writer had in mind) would have been appropriate. See also 5. 4. Labeling It should be unnecessary to point out that when a series is numbered ( 1, 2, 3, etc.) or lettered ( A, B, C, etc.), the same system must be followed throughout. Yet here is what a TV network news man said on a radio talk show; he was stating his objections to Republican ef- forts in Congress to balance the federal budget: A, they’re moving too fast; and sec- ond, they’re meddling in social issues. 5. Multiple paragraphs Sometimes the items in a series are listed in separate paragraphs. When they are, no conjunction is needed. A mark precedes each paragraph, unless a num- ber or letter precedes it; the mark usually is a bullet, a black circle or square. The example below, from an article, is defec- tive. The film features more than 12 minutes of computer effects from ILM . . . including: • A stampede of three-dimensional elephants, rhinos and zebras. . . . • A playful band of monkeys messing up the kitchen of a . . . mansion. . . . • The mansion is also invaded by a snarling lion and a thundering herd of rhinos. The three bullets indicate three items in the series. As in any series, all of its items must be grammatically alike. The writer series errors 381 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 381"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"has set out to list various computer ef- fects included in a film; the word “in- cluding” needs to fit each item. It does fit the first two items, which are noun phrases, but not the third item, which is a complete sentence. “Including” would fit the third too if it said, for instance: “ An invasion by a snarling lion and a thundering herd of rhinos.” To make the second item more compatible, begin it with a noun representing the action, comparable to “A stampede,” for in- stance: “A messing of the kitchen of a . . . mansion by a playful band of mon- keys.” 6. OR shortage What applies to the conjunction and in earlier discussions can apply to the conjunction or. This is from a book about the book business: . . . Not all authors are promotable, well spoken, or have books that lend themselves to promotion. After “promotable” insert or. (And omit the commas.) The “or” that joins the verbs, “ar e . . .” and “have . . . ,” has nothing to do with the or needed to join the adjectives, “promotable” and “well spoken.” The following sentence is more com- plicated. It is from a government circular explaining that names, titles, and short phrases may not be copyrighted. This is true even if the name, title, phrase, or expression is novel, distinc- tive, or lends itself to a play on words. The sentence has three series. The first, consisting of four nouns, is perfectly proper. There is also a series of verbs, consisting of the second “is . . .” and “lends. . . . ” Under the second “is,” a subseries of two adjectives needs to be joined by a conjunction: “novel or dis- tinctive.” 7. Punctuation In a series of two, the items are not or- dinarily separated by a comma. In a longer series, you will find the last two items sometimes separated by a comma, sometimes not. It depends on what you are reading. The Chicago Manual of Style, used by book editors, favors the comma and so does this book. The style of nearly all newspapers is to leave out the comma, on the grounds that a con- junction takes its place. The book style goes “blood, toil, tears, and sweat.” The newspaper style goes “blood, toil, tears and sweat.” The argument for omitting the comma is disputable, for both theoretical and practical reasons. A comma and a con- junction have different functions. A comma separates items; a conjunction joins them. If it is important to separate blood and toil and tears from one another, it should be just as important to separate tears and sweat from each other. The comma does so. The conjunction does not; it links all the four items into a series. A related practice of many newspa- pers is odder yet: After using one or more semicolons to separate some items in a series, a writer turns to a comma to separate the last two items. Just as a comma does not have the function of a conjunction, it does not have the func- tion of a semicolon. Both practices can lead to confusion. Consistent punctuation is indispensable in a complicated series. It enables readers to mentally separate the different cate- gories and place everything in the right category. An article deals with “spies in the CIA, the NSA, the Navy’s antisubmarine warfare program and Navy communica- tions and Middle East intelligence opera- tions.” After “NSA” the boundaries get murky. To clarify them, follow “pro- gram” and “communications” with commas and delete the first “and” (as- suming that five items are listed).

Repeated conjunctions For emphasis or extra clarity, a con- junction may follow each item of a se- ries. Excerpts from the Magna Carta (with emphasis added) will illustrate.

Superfluous word The problem with the sentence below, from a computer book, is not that it needs an extra conjunction but that it contains an extra article. Given the indicators in the status bar, you can tell the document number, page number, line number, and the po- sition of the cursor. The “the” just before “document num- ber” covers all the four items enumer- ated. Omit the “the” just before “position of the cursor.” An unneeded pronoun, the second “she,” appears in the next sentence, by a news agency. The first she is the subject for all the verbs. She stood alone in backing the 1986 U.S. bombing raid on Libya; fol- lowed Washington out of UNESCO in 1985 ; was the first to deploy U.S. cruise missiles in Europe in 1983 ; and last year, when the superpowers agreed to remove the missiles, she put aside her reservations and gave the deal a ringing endorsement.

The sun, cement, and setters set. People, courts, and most ob- jects sit. “Set” in place of sit is dialectal and nonstandard—with some exceptions: clothing and setting hens set or sit. There is no exception in the sentence below, from an article: Are your mirrors secured to the wall, or are they setting on a bureau leaning against the wall ready to come down in a shower of glass? Change “setting” to sitting. (And insert commas after “bureau” and “wall” to make it clear that the bureau is not lean- ing against the wall and the wall is not ready to come down.) SET UP and SETUP. Set up is a verb (transitive) meaning to establish, begin, create, assemble, or place (something or someone) in a high or upright position. “He set up the business ten years ago.” / “Can you set up the tent?” Informally it means to make (someone) appear guilty. “The police set him up.” Setup is a noun designating a plan, ar- rangement, or organization or the way in which something is set up. “The dia- gram describes the setup of our agency.” Informally it denotes a supposed contest in which the outcome is known in ad- vance. “This fight is a setup.” A note printed on software envelopes says, “You may setup your software on your new computer if you delete it from your old computer.” Change “setup” to set up.

The word took on the meaning of a slaughterhouse. Usually s would be added at the end, but the word might be construed as either singular or plural. By extension, shambles became a scene of carnage or extensive bloodshed. In Shakespeare’s King Henry VI, Part III, the king says: “Far be the thought of this from Henry’s heart, / To make a sham- bles of the parliament-house!” It was probably a fresh metaphor in Eliza- bethan times. The meaning of a literal slaughter- house is obsolete. If you wish to use shambles in its purest extant form, you can still use it to describe a scene of widespread bloodshed. For instance, “Tribal enmity has made Rwanda a shambles.” Whether you will be under- stood is uncertain, for casual use has wa- tered down the word’s common function to the point of triviality. The element of bloodshed is rarely present anymore. Sometimes the word is applied to exten- sive destruction. More often it is used to describe mere disarray or confusion, in the manner of the following examples. [From a news agency:] The apartment was a shambles, with drawers open, clothes strewn around, “all the flat- ware on the floor, all the silverware out. . . .” [A music review:] The second move- ment in “Jupiter” is outlandishly fast, while the finale is reduced to a manic shambles as the players audibly strug- gle to get in all the notes. [A form letter:] . . . The Enforcement Division—perhaps EPA’s most impor- tant arm—is a shambles. [A headline:] His life a shambles, De Lorean faces a maze of legal troubles There is no bloodshed, no destruction. Applied to those scenes, even ruin would be an extravagance. They might display chaos, confusion, disarray, or disorder, but is there “a shambles” anywhere? To Sir Ernest Gowers, using “sham- bles” to describe a “mere muddle and disorder that is wholly bloodless is a SLIPSHOD EXTENSION emasculating 384 sex and gender 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 384"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"the word.” More grammatical authori- ties condone the looser uses than con- demn them. But you may choose. SHE and HER. See Pronouns, 10. SHEAR. 1. SHEAR and SHEER. 2. SHEAR OFF. 1. SHEAR and SHEER In reporting that a bank “has sheered its permanent employee roster by a chunky 11 , 000 ,” a weekly paper showed that it was just as capable of mixing up words as a daily was. The verb that should have appeared was sheared. To shear is to cut (something) with shears or as if with shears, to cut from, or to remove by cutting. To sheer is to swerve, to deviate, to turn away from a course (“The ship sheered off its course to rescue the survivors”), or to cause to swerve or deviate. The two verbs (each transitive and in- transitive) are pronounced the same; and sheer may have begun as a form of shear, which goes back to Old English. Nowa- days, however, you do not sheer and shear alike. See also Homophones. 2. SHEAR OFF It is an aging cliché of the news busi- ness. A reporter is apt to choose “shear off” before cut off, detach, sever, tear off, or fall off. And it is seldom a sheep that is sheared or shorn. A television reporter said, twice, that branches were “sheared off” in a Louisiana hurricane. Another reported that an aviation mishap in New York had “sheared off one of the aircraft’s en- gines.” Using the verb in an odd, intransitive way, an article dealt with the inability of an airliner’s pilots to know—until the plane landed, safely, in Florida—that one of the three engines “had sheared off and plummeted 35 , 000 feet.” Evidence indicated that frozen water from a leaky lavatory might be the reason that the en- gine had fallen off or severed. But “shear off” can perhaps be misleading in a story about an air accident, suggesting wind shear, a sudden change in wind, as the cause. SHIMMER and SHIMMY. To shimmer is to shine with a quivering or flickering light. It evolved from the Old English scimrian (spelling varied), which probably originated in Greek. To shimmy is to wobble or shake ab- normally or to do the shimmy, a dance popular in the 1920 s. Also called the shimmy shake, the dance featured rapid shaking. Shimmy is a corruption of chemise, a woman’s undergarment. A travel writer, telling about a volcano, wrote: “Heat rays wavered, making the distant trees shimmy incan- descently.” The wavering heat rays and the adverb “incandescently” imply that she had seen the trees shimmer, not wob- ble or dance.

Silicon is the basic material in semi- conductor devices used in computer cir- cuits and various electronic products. Pronounced SILL-lick-con and symbol- ized by Si, it is an element: that is, a basic substance, not dividable into any other substance by normal means. It is the sec- ond most plentiful element on earth, al- though not found in pure form. The only element more plentiful is oxygen, which is combined with silicon as silica (SiO 2 ) in sand, rocks, and quartz. A silicone, pronounced SILL-lick- cone, is a compound: that is, a substance composed of elements that are chemi- cally combined and so lack individual identities. Silicones make up a large group of synthetic, polymeric com- pounds of silicon, oxygen, and hydro- gen.

Promoting a forthcoming pro- gram about Queen Elizabeth II, a woman announced on television, “She sired children who have shaken the crown of England to its very core.” Put aside any doubts about the metaphor and the image it conjures of someone shaking the jewels and gilding off a royal crown. The main problem lies in the choice of the word “sired.” Any of these would have been a better choice: gave birth to, bore, bred, brought forth, produced. To sire is to father. It usually applies to four-legged animals. A stallion or bull is a sire; the opposite parent is a dam; and applying any such word to the queen of England is a dam shame. See also BEGET. SIT and SET. See SET and SIT. SITE confused with SIGHT. See Homophones. SITUATION. The noun situation is not always necessary when used in the sense of a state of affairs or a set of cir- cumstances. For example, a booklet de- scribes six crises: In this they were similar to numerous instances over the years in which Pres- idents have sent U.S. armed forces overseas without congressional au- thorization, in crisis situations. The sentence could end in crises. It does not need “situations.” Similarly, the use of “situation” (twice) seems superfluous in the excerpt below from a study in a quarterly journal.

A book al- ludes to the shooting of a duck for din- ner: “The shell was fetched, the duck slayed.” To slay, meaning to kill, usually violently, is an acceptable verb in the context. No “slayed” exists, however. The past participle of slay is slain: “. . . the duck [was] slain.” The past tense of slay is slew: “Little David was a shepherd boy / Who slew Goliath and jumped for joy.” The verb comes from Old English. From Irish Gaelic we get slew, also slue, a colloquial noun meaning a large number or amount. Slue, also slew, means (verb, transitive and intransitive) to rotate and (noun) rotating. Its origin is uncertain; it has a nautical history. Both spellings are pronounced SLOO. SLEW, SLUE. See SLAY, SLAIN, SLEW. SMELL. See AROMA. SNEAKED and “SNUCK.” From TV accounts of an attempted coup in Moscow and rescues from the Polish ghetto: “Gorbachev and his son-in-law snuck into a closed room . . .” / “a friend snuck him in to see the children.” Sneaked should have been used in each instance. It is the proper past tense and past participle of sneak (verb, transitive and intransitive), meaning to move quietly and stealthily so as not to be ob- served, or to act in a secret or under- handed manner. One dictionary describes “snuck” as chiefly dialectal, another as nonstan- dard. If chosen at all, it should be re- stricted to a frivolous context. SOCIALIST, SOCIALISM. The president was quoted in support of eco- nomic reforms in noncapitalist coun- tries: “Even the Socialist world is beginning to see that Socialism isn’t just another economic system—it’s the death of economics. . . . ” Mr. Bush went further in his speech today, saying that reform efforts in the Soviet Union, China and other Social- ist countries were part of “an exciting trend. . . . ” A capital S does not belong in “Social- ist” or “Socialism” unless it is part of the name of a party or movement (e.g., the Socialist Party) or is in a title. The capi- talized term needs to be distinguished from general references to an economy or a political idea: socialist or socialism, with a lower-case s (a socialist economy). The Soviet Union was run by Com- munists, with a capital C, who consid- ered their economic system to be socialism or a socialist system. It is a sys- tem in which the means of production and distribution are owned and con- trolled by the state. In their theory (and it was theory in the most hypothetical sense) socialism would ultimately de- velop into communism (adjective com- munist ), an ideal system of economic equality in which the state became un- necessary. Under any theory, the regime could be described as Communist, with a capital socialist, socialism 387 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 387"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"C, in the sense that it was led by Com- munists: members of the Communist Party.

Before a number. 2. SOME PLACE and SOMEPLACE. 3. SOME TIME and SOMETIME. 1. Before a number Some in front of a round number means approximately or about. Thus “some 5 , 000 people” implies a rough count, above or below the exact total. “Some” does not go with a number that is or appears precise, as in this sentence: . . . The company, in a newspaper ad- vertisement, promoted a supposed $ 149 fare to London from New York in type size some 136 times larger than the note, which indicated that the fare was “each way” of a required round-trip purchase. Omit “some.” A phrase like “some 100 times” would be a normal place for it. But the number 136 is or appears to be exact. Odd is a similar term, when con- nected to a round number, except that it indicates only an excess, never a short- age. “I estimate that 500 -odd people were present.” Remember the hyphen, unless you are describing “odd people.” Some and -odd should not go together (“some 40 -odd executives”). Neither is necessary if a figure is described in some other way as an approximation or an es- timate. Finally, some or -odd goes with a sizable number, not with a small digit. 2. SOME PLACE and SOMEPLACE Someplace (adverb) means at, in, or to some place. It is more informal than somewhere, which has the same mean- ing. Some critics scorn someplace in writing even when it is used correctly. An editor used it incorrectly: Is it possible for someplace peaceful and nice and affordable . . . to be pre- served from greed and specula- tion . . . ? Correction: “for some place that is peaceful and nice and affordable” or “for some peaceful and nice and afford- able place. ” If someplace is acceptable at all, it is interchangeable with somewhere, as in “Let’s go out someplace.” Somewhere is no substitute for “someplace” in the press quotation. The American Heritage Dictionary termed someplace informal, and 83 per- cent of its usage panel rejected as a writ- ing sample “an unspecified target someplace between Inchon and Seoul.” 3. SOME TIME and SOMETIME Distinguishing some time, an adjec- tive and noun, from sometime, an ad- verb, can be confusing. • Some time usually means an indefinite period of time: “They plan to spend some time in Nepal.” • Sometime means at an indefinite point in time: “Come up and see me sometime.” / “He lived sometime during the Tang Dynasty.” However, some time can have the sec- ond meaning when next to certain words: “I’ll come back at some time in the future.” / “The troupe appeared here some time ago. ” As a test, omit some time or some- time: If the sentence makes no sense, use the phrase.

After spending $ 28 million of his own money in an unsuc- cessful campaign for a Senate seat, a can- didate futilely tried to undo the election on grounds of electoral fraud and irregu- larities. A newspaper editorial attacked his claims as “an expensive case of sour grapes.” Something that a person would like to have but pretends to dislike because he cannot have it is sour grapes. The term can also apply to the disparagement of the prize. Inasmuch as the losing candi- date had nothing ill to say about the of- fice of senator, “sour grapes” was not relevant. A rewrite: “the last resort of a sore loser.” The Aesop fable of the fox and the grapes gave rise to the expression. A fox desired some high-hanging grapes but failed to reach them in several leaps. He walked away, remarking, “They are sour!” Translations from ancient Greek disagree on whether the fox spoke in jest or in seriousness, and they disagree on what the moral was. SPANISH AMERICA and LATIN AMERICA. See LATIN(-)AMER- ICAN. SPAT and SPATE. “A spat of wet weather is causing problems. . . . ” It was said on a TV news program. The noun spat has several meanings: a minor quarrel, a partial shoe covering, a sound like that made by rain, and an im- mature oyster. None fits the quotation. Spate is the noun that was needed. It is a sudden, heavy rain; or an unusually large rush or outpouring of something; or, in Britain, a flash flood. Conceivably a couple frustrated by in- ability to play golf or tend a garden could engage in “a spat of wet weather,” but that was not the televised story. SPEAK, SPOKE, and SPOKEN. See Tense, 5A. SPEAK TO, TALK TO. To “speak to” a motion, meaning to comment on it, is part of the jargon of parliamentary procedure. To adapt it to general use introduces an element of ambiguity to the language. It makes a good deal of difference whether “The president will speak about Congress” or “ to Congress.” Besides, the little preposition to is overworked enough as it is. Nevertheless, an anchor man said, “House members stayed open all night to speak to this issue,” the flag. A coun- terpart of his found a presidential debate “talking to issues the people wanted to hear about.” A flowery newspaper story speak to, talk to 389 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 389"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"about a tribute to a late baseball player said, “And Ralph Branca and Joe Black could speak to the vulnerable yet un- bending man who lived a career so com- pelling” (etc.).

See Confus- ing pairs. Spelling. 1. Errors. 2. Irregularity and tradition. 3. Principles. 1. Errors Vice President J. Danforth Quayle was responsible for the most prominent misspelling of an English word in recent history when he miscorrected a school child’s spelling of potato by placing an “e” at the end. The plural, potatoes, has the e, not the singular. Similarly a tomato becomes tomatoes in the plural. Spelling in English is hazardous. Er- rors appear in books, periodicals, and the best newspapers. One newspaper in that category hap- pened to misspell expel in its main story on the front page: “Keep the foreigner away from your holy shrines so we will all stand as one to expell the dark- ness. . . . ” (Saddam Hussein of Iraq was being quoted. Americans have often con- sidered him a villain, but making him out a bad speller as well may be going too far.) The same paper has also printed mis- spellings of such words as advisory (mis- spelling it “advisery”), interference (“interferance”), minuscule (“minis- cule”), mobile (“mobil”), prerogative (“perogatives”—several times), and war- rant (“warrentless”). Headlines in several other newspapers have contained these misspellings: achieve (“acheives”), catastrophic (“cat- astropic”), indecisiveness (“indecicive- ness”), minuscule (“miniscule” again), optometrist (“optomitrists”), psychiatric (“psyciatric”), scrapping (“scraping”), and sufferers (“suffers”). A banner reads “Protestors want officers fired,” using an old “-or” variant instead of the custom- ary protester(s). See WHOSE, 2, for a worse mistake. Apologize (“apoligize”), delegate (“delagate”), ingenious (“ingenius”), and prosthesis (“prothesis”) have been misspelled in books dealing with the mu- sic industry, famous people, English us- age, and medicine, respectively. A cookbook misspells four words: cayenne (“cayene”), coarsely (“coarsley”), fore- word (“foreward”), and pomegranate (“pomegranite”). See also FOREWORD and FORWARD. A book instructing would-be book publishers misspells four other words: afraid (“affraid”), bulge (“buldge” twice), rivet (“rivit”), and simplest (“simplist”); and it disconnects a fifth: whatever (“what ever”). It also confuses lose with “loose.” A lexicographer misspells resistible (“resistable”) in a book dealing with the English language. Some copies of two general dictionaries misspell millennium (“millenium”) and vichyssoise (“vichy- soisse”). Webster’s Third Dictionary gives sev- eral misspellings as variants, thereby tending to encourage the errors. It con- dones spelling harebrained as “hair- brained,” marshal as “marshall,” nickel as “nickle,” prophecy and prophesy as each other, restaurateur as “restauran- teur,” and therefore as “therefor.” Writers are not always responsible for the misspellings that appear under their names. Editing and typographical mis- 390 specie and species 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 390"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"spellings occur, especially the latter. Ty- pographical misspelling may reflect the pressing of wrong keys or the transposi- tion or omission of letters. Some out- landish combinations are obviously errors and the easiest to notice before publication. (At first I typed “thekr” in- stead of their in the first sentence of this paragraph.) Mistakes by writers or edi- tors tend to be more plausible; often the misspelling can be pronounced the same as the correct word. Someone simply spelled it wrong. On many occasions, words that I spelled correctly in my copy turned up in print misspelled, usually by a typesetter, sometimes by an editor. For instance, framers (of the Constitution) came out “farmers” and pastime was changed to “pasttime.” See also OCULIST (etc.). Here is an alphabetical list of other words that I have found to be publicly misspelled, mostly in newspapers but also on the television screen and in cor- porate and governmental printings. The style of the examples above is repeated; first the correct spelling appears, then in parentheses the misspelling: academy (“accademy”) accommodations (“acomodations”) acquiescent (“acquiscent”) alley (“alee”) bawdy (“baudy”) benefiting (“benefitting”) cabaret (“caberet”) commitment (“committment”) competitive (“competative”) deceit (“deceipt”) depositor(s) (“depositers”) entirety (“entirity”) ideology (“idealogy”) irreverent (“irreverant”) nonsense (“nonsence”) observer(s) (“observors”) phonetically (“phoneticly”) repetition (“repitition”) stretched (“streched”) supersede(s) (“supercedes”) transmogrify (“transmorgrify”) vegetarian (“vegeterian”) wait (“wate”) weird (“wierd”) In the collection for this book, the most common spelling mistakes are the substitution of letters (e.g., an “i” for the first u in minuscule ) and the omission of letters (a c and an m in accommoda- tion ). Less common mistakes are the ad- dition of letters (a “t” in pastime ) and the transposition of letters (the e and l in coarsely ). Those four kinds of error are further illustrated respectively in the en- tries SHEAR; LEAP, LEAPED, LEAPT; MARSHAL; NICKEL.

The main problem in the pairs of words listed in Confusing pairs, such as adverse and averse, is not misspelling as such but the mixing up of words, which can amount to misspelling. Likeness of sound in a pair such as right and write or accept and except ac- counts for some lapses. See Homo- phones. A few contractions are confused with possessives and vice versa.

Irregularity and tradition Critics of English spelling complain about its irregularity, its many ways of representing a sound. For instance, the a sound in day appears also in aim, cabaret, exposé, gauge, great, lake, mat- ing, nee, obey, veil, and weigh. The sh sound in ash is also in appreciate, crescendo, machine, motion, ocean, pas- sion, schnauzer, and sure. Approaching it from a language like Spanish, with almost entirely regular, phonetic spelling and one basic sound per vowel, English may seem totally chaotic. But compared with written Chi- nese, which has no alphabet and thou- sands of characters to learn, written English is tolerably phonetic. Its twenty- six letters do represent sounds, at least in combination. It has its rules for spelling, and most spellings follow regular pat- terns. Unfortunately, the rules all have exceptions, and many of the irregular words are frequently used. Good spellers keenly sense how words sound and (to handle irregularity) how they look. Spelling in English reflects a multicul- tural history and includes patterns of Old English, French, Greek, Latin, and other languages, mainly the Romance. To begin with, English had fewer charac- ters than sounds, requiring combina- tions of letters to represent many sounds. The written language failed to keep up with sound changes, such as the silenc- ing of the k and e in knave. Significant episodes included respelling by French scribes after the Norman conquest; changes by early printers, many of them foreign, who often justified (evened) lines by adding or subtracting letters; and a sixteenth-century fashion of imi- tating Latin and Greek forms—even, for instance, putting the s in i(s)land, a word of Old English origin, in the misbelief that it came from the Latin insula. En- glish in North America reflects to some extent the aboriginal, immigrant, and Latin-American traditions. Since the nineteenth century, move- ments have arisen to reform spelling and thereby make learning easier for children and improve the spelling of the general public. They won the support of such lu- minaries as Charles Darwin and Alfred Tennyson. Andrew Carnegie financed a simplified-spelling board, which faded away. George Bernard Shaw’s will cre- ated a new alphabet, of forty letters, which never caught on. The Chicago Tri- bune once attempted innovations like “telegraf” and “frate” but then returned to customary spellings. Readers may have thought the phonetic spellings were mistakes. “Words should be spelled as they sound,” many people have said, un- aware of hazards. A rapid and radical change to a wholly phonetic system might quickly render obsolete centuries of literature and considerable knowl- edge. Some books would be revised, but the mean techniques of much modern book manufacturing might not permit them to endure. It could be confusing if, say, the homophones sew and sow were spelled the same as so. And if speech de- termined spelling, speakers of English from different places might have trouble reading one another’s writings. In England, a request of mine for di- rections to Bath was met with a stare un- til I thought to pronounce it BAHTH. Much earlier, an old record on which a baritone sang of a place where flying fishes PLY and the dawn comes up like thunder out of China ’cross the BY gave me my first lesson in Australian English. American pronunciations too vary by re- gion. Take the word court, which a New Yorker or Bostonian is apt to pronounce CAUT and a Southerner COAT while many to the west say CORT.

Principles A. The best rule The rules of spelling and their excep- tions are so extensive that we can only hint at them here. Many spellings have to be learned, one by one. Rules will not help in distin- guishing the words ending in -able such as peaceable from those ending in -ible such as feasible. Nor will rules help in segregating -ant words ( defendant ) from -ent words ( dependent ); -or words ( in- spector ) from -er words ( invader ); or words with -seed sounds from one an- other ( precede, proceed, supersede ). When in doubt, look it up. That is the best rule. B. Doubling; suffixes; prefixes The last letter of a word is often dou- bled when a suffix is added: for example, fit becomes fitting and begin becomes be- ginner. (A suffix is a word part affixed to the end of a basic word to alter the meaning.) At the end of a one-syllable word or a word accented on the last syl- lable, a single consonant is apt to be doubled before a suffix starting with a vowel. In the two examples above, the suffixes added are -ing and -er. Other ex- amples are bag, baggage / deter, deter- rent / remit, remittance / ship, shipped. The last letter of the basic word, or root word, is not doubled if adding the suffix shifts the accent to a previous syl- lable: con-FER, CON-fer-ence and pre- FER, PREF-er-ence (but con-FERRED, pre-FER-ring, etc.). At the end of a word accented on a syllable besides the last, a single conso- nant is usually not doubled before a suf- fix starting with a vowel. Examples are develop, developing and happen, hap- pening, but an exception is handicap, handicapped, handicapping. A final l is retained before a suffix be- ginning with l: cruel, cruelly / formal, formally / national, nationally. Other- wise, suffixes do not usually double l endings in America ( dial becomes dialed, dialing and marvel becomes marveled, marveling ) but do in Britain ( dialled, di- alling and marvelled, marvelling ). Al- most conversely, -ll endings stay double in America when prefixes are added ( roll, enroll ) but are made single in Britain ( enrol ). And double letters in combat(t)ing, worship(p)ing, and other words are more common in Britain. In America, affixing a prefix does not usually vary the spelling of the parts, even when the last letter of the prefix and the first letter of the root word are the same: Mis- plus state gives misstate. Over- plus run gives overrun. (A prefix is a word part affixed to the beginning of a basic word to alter the meaning.) A word ending in c requires the addi- tion of k before an e, i, or y suffix if a hard pronunciation of c remains: mimic, mimicked / panic, panicky / traffic, traf- ficking. In music, musician and toxic, toxicity the pronunciation of c becomes soft. C. I before E? The misspeller of achieve seems to have forgotten the old pedagogic mnemonic, or memory aid, “ I before E, / Except after C. ” Unfortunately, the mis- speller of weird seems to have remem- bered it. Scores of words use ei, including caf- feine, counterfeit, either, foreign, forfeit, height, heir, leisure, neither, plebeian, protein, seize, stein, and veil; various -ing words like being and seeing; and words with the prefix re-, like reinstate and reiterate. Even the exception in the rhyme has exceptions: Conscience, fi- nancier, omniscient, prescient, science, and species are all cie words. spelling 393 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 393"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"Some have been taught an extra verse to the mnemonic, “Or when sounded like a / As in neighbor or weigh, ” which may be more useful than the main verse. D. Silent E The silent e generally makes a short vowel sound long; for example, turning can into cane, rot into rote, and sit into site. The silent e is usually omitted before a suffix starting with a vowel: adore, ador- ing; debate, debatable; mate, mating; quote, quotation; write, writing. Among the exceptions are some words that would be transformed if the e were re- moved: dye, dyeing / hoe, hoeing / shoe, shoeing / singe, singeing. Many words that end in -ce or -ge are exceptions too when the e preserves the soft sound: change, changeable / encourage, encour- agement / grace, graceful; but i suffixes are an exception to the exception and do drop the e: changing, encouraging. The e is usually retained before a suf- fix starting with a consonant: careless, lately, statement. But some words ending in -le do drop the e before the suffix -ly ( gentle, gently and simple, simply ). E. Spelling checkers Most word-processing programs for computers have features to help users verify and correct the spelling of words in their documents. They are called spelling checkers, spell checkers, spellers, or the like. Useful devices, they often save the users from mistakes in spelling or slips of the keyboard by highlighting words considered wrong and suggesting alternatives. They will not rescue slips in grammar or word selection as long as every word typed is a recognized word. They will find nothing wrong if you type bake in- stead of brake, complement instead of compliment, loathe instead of loath, phrase instead of phase, or them instead of theme (a mistake I made). And having been devised by human beings, they are not infallible even within their province. One popular program disapproved of ads, em, exposé, and wracked; approved of checkouts but not checkout and coworkers but not coworker; and sug- gested that afterword be “afterward,” temblor be “tumbler,” backdoor be “bookstore,” and obvious be “obi” (a Japanese sash or a type of sorcery).

A recording tells callers to a city library, “All of our staff are helping others.” It is not wrong, though it has a British flavor. Staff is would be the more customary way in the United States. Staff is a collective noun meaning the employees, assistants, or officers who carry out the work of a particular enter- prise or organization. The plural in that sense is staffs. A staff is also a flagpole, walking stick, or rod; or the set of five parallel lines that music is written on. In those senses, the plural is either staffs or staves. A musical staff is sometimes called a stave. An informal term for a member of a staff is a staffer. Regarding that word, The New York Times tells its own staff, “Do not use for staff member(s) or mem- ber(s) of the staff. ” See also Collective nouns, 1; WHO and WHOM, 1. STAND and RUN.

The discovery of a distant galaxy prompted a news agency to issue this dubious statement: “The core apparently contains at least 30 , 000 closely packed suns. . . . ” No more precision characterizes a dis- cussion of galaxy clusters in a book of popular astronomy: “But not even our galaxy, with its 100 billion suns, is inde- pendent and self-sufficient. . . . ” In both instances, stars would be preferable to “suns.” A star is a celestial body that emits its own light. A sun is a star that is the center of a system of plan- ets, the way the Sun, the star closest to us, heads our solar system.

The intended meaning is that those forms are often used by people of all classes, including laborers and execu- tives. That is not the literal meaning. A stevedore is a type of executive. Many people, lexicographers among them, misconceive him to be a laborer who loads and unloads ships. That is not the way a stevedore is likely to use the word. He sees himself as a contractor who ar- ranges the loading and unloading of ships. He does not do the actual labor- ing; he hires men to do it. The working- men call themselves longshoremen. Note the difference between the names of the companies, such as Steve- doring Service of America and Metropolitan California Stevedore Co., and the names of the labor unions: the International Longshoremen’s Associa- tion (in the East) and the International Longshoremen’s and Warehousemen’s Union (in the West). STINT. “Quayle says he’s healthy now despite two recent stints in the hos- pital,” a newscaster announced over a radio network. The former vice presi- dent did not become a hospital worker; he was a hospital patient. The broad- caster wrongly used “stints” when stays would have been a better choice of words. A stint (noun) is usually an allotment of work or piece of work. For instance, “He finished his daily stint at the fac- tory.” A stint can be also a limitation, of- ten an undue limitation. To stint can mean to limit or restrict one (verb, transitive) or to limit or re- strict oneself, to get along on a trifling al- lowance (verb, intransitive). STOMACH. The host of a radio talk show spoke of a woman’s “carrying that baby in her stomach.” And a movie re- viewer wrote that a character resented that he had to “share his woman with that baby in her stomach.” The stomach is an organ of digestion. Unless each woman had been emulating the dining behavior of a mythological monster, the anatomical reference in each instance was misplaced. If neither the radio man nor the movie reviewer had the stomach for womb or uterus, each could have got by with abdomen, belly, or middle. Of those three nouns, abdomen, the part of the trunk between the chest and the pelvis, is the most sci- entific; middle is the vaguest. Belly is a standard word, but much of the public feels that it is unrefined. Tummy is baby talk for stomach. As a synonym for the abdomen, “stomach” is suitable only for casual conversation, if that. It is best to avoid using one organ as a synonym for an- other organ, particularly when talking to one’s physician. An old saw has it that “the way to a man’s heart is through his stomach.” If you believe it, don’t think of being a sur- geon. STRAIGHTFORWARD. See Ad- jectives and adverbs. STUDENT.

For gener- ations, writers on language have been declaring the subjunctive “moribund” / “almost disappeared” / “just about dead.” As long ago as 1860 , a writer found “good reason to suppose that it will soon become obsolete altogether.” While the subjunctive has declined over the centuries, it stubbornly refuses to ex- pire. Most English-speakers handle the subjunctive at some time or other. Every- one does who has scrawled “Wish you were here” on a postcard; sung “If I Were a Rich Man” or used a variety of other sentences containing if; uttered or understood such idioms as be that as it may, come what may, heaven forbid, and perish the thought; or attended formal meetings, which commonly make use of expressions like “I move that members be notified. . . . ” Whereas the indicative mood deals with facts or supposed facts and the im- perative mood directly commands a sec- ond person, the subjunctive mood essentially concerns ideas. It presents an action or state of being as a mental con- ception, not as a fact. More specifically, it expresses contingencies, desires, ex- hortations, hypotheses, impossibilities, orders (indirectly), prospects, requests, suppositions, and wishes. The subjunctive (from the Late Latin subjunctivus ) was so named because it was considered suitable for subjoined clauses; that is, subordinate clauses. To subjoin is literally to append. See also Mood. 2. Forms of the subjunctive The subjunctive mood may be compli- cated in some respects, but its conjuga- tion of verbs is simple: A verb does not change with the person, whether first, second, or third, singular or plural. Verbs have three forms in the subjunc- tive. (They resemble and therefore are named after tenses in the indicative mood, but the term tense would be mis- leading in the subjunctive, which lacks clear time distinctions.) We list the three verb forms (A, B, and C) followed by a number of common auxiliary verbs that also express the subjunctive mood (D). A. The so-called present subjunctive uses the root, or basic version, of a verb. It appears in clauses following the verbs advise, ask, beg, demand, insist, order, recommend, request, require, sug- gest, urge, warn, and so on. Often such a clause contains the word that. “The boss ordered that she work late tomorrow.” / “The committee recommended that the bill pass. ” / “Is it necessary that the office be closed?” / “We request that the audi- ence remain standing.” / “I suggest he think twice about it.” Clauses containing lest use that form. “We must strengthen the levee, lest the river flood us again.” The same form is found in many Bib- lical passages, like the following. (Sub- junctive verbs are emphasized.) “. . . I fear him, lest he come and slay us all. . . .” / “For there is hope for a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again. . . . Though its root grow old in the earth, and its stump die in the ground, yet at the scent of water it will bud. . . . ” B. The so-called past subjunctive uses what in the indicative mood would be the past tense. But the verb be takes were for all persons. Often would appears in the sentence. The past subjunctive appears in clauses that follow the verb wish. “I wish I had a million dollars.” / “She wishes she lived in Paris.” It is also found in poetic sentences expressing the mean- ing of wish in other ways: “Would God I were the tender apple blossom.” / “O, that I were a glove upon that hand. . . . ” It appears also in many conditional sentences: those sentences in which one action depends on another. Such sen- 398 subjunctive 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 398"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"tences may contain if and would. The if- clause may be contrary to fact, hypothet- ical, impossible, or unlikely: “If George Washington returned today, he would be shocked.” / “I wouldn’t do that if I were you.” A conditional sentence in which the if- clause expresses a possibility may use that pattern (although it does not have to): “If an emergency arose tomorrow, we would be ready.” / “Would you keep it confidential if I told you a secret?” As an option, such a sentence may be cast in the simple future tense of the indicative mood. “If an emergency arises tomor- row, we will be ready.” / “ Will you keep it confidential if I tell you a secret?” C. The past perfect subjunctive is the only one of the three forms to pertain to time. The time is the past. Resembling the past perfect tense of the indicative mood, it uses had and a past participle. Its use implies that what is said about a past action or condition is contrary to fact. “If he had run just a bit faster, he would have escaped.” / “I wish that Wintergreen had won the election.” / “ Had we bought the land then, we would be rich today.” D. Various auxiliary verbs can also express the subjunctive mood. Among them are could, ought, may, might, must, should, and would. The action or condition that one of those auxiliary verbs pertain to may be either contrary to fact or possible. “I could have danced all night.” / “She ought to have said no.” / “The dog may be a biter.” / “It seemed for a while as though the argument might get violent.” / “You must have been a beautiful baby.” / “If you should get lost, give me a call.” / “We would need to pay more.” See also MAY and MIGHT; WAS and WERE. 3. Mistakes The Stephen Foster song “Dixie” and the folk song “Cindy”—which say “I wish I was in Dixie” and “I wish I was an apple”—demonstrate a common de- viation from subjunctive form. We will not try to revise those famous old songs. Just be aware that to say “I wish it was better news” or “I wish I was in his posi- tion”—instead of “it were ” and “I were ”—may be judged at best colloquial and at worst illiterate. Furthermore, the meaning can hinge on the choice of mood. The consequence of choosing the wrong one can be misun- derstanding. Let us illustrate through two similar sentences. A. “She suggested that he attend meetings regularly.” Using the subjunc- tive, the sentence means that she sug- gested (proposed) his presence at the meetings. B. “She suggested that he attends meetings regularly.” Using the indicative, the sentence implies that he goes to the meetings already, a fact disclosed by her suggestion (hint). The following two examples come from a book of travel reminiscences. (They are taken out of context deliber- ately to demonstrate the grammatical er- rors in both.) Both use the past tense when they should use the present sub- junctive. I suggested we flew along. . . . But he had insisted they tried again. . . . Each sentence seems to say that the sub- ject made a factual statement about something that had already happened: that we had flown along and that they had tried again. The context shows the meaning that was intended; in each case the subject was making a proposal for future action: “I suggested [proposed that] we fly along. . . . ” / “But he insisted [urged that] they try again. . . . ” (The “had” was unwarranted.) The sentence below, from an autobi- subjunctive 399 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 399"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"ography, contains a similar error in the choice of verb form, although the mean- ing is not compromised. ...I got a call from Senator Sam Nunn’s secretary telling me to make sure that on the next afternoon I watched C-Span, the cable TV chan- nel. . . . It should be “to make sure that . . . I watch C-Span. . . . ” The secretary was recommending future action, not bring- ing up past action. Each of the following three sample sentences, from news reports, seems to be part subjunctive and part indicative. Such switching of moods within a thought will not do. OTS Director Ryan imposed mild restrictions that would apply to Bush if he again becomes a director of a bank or savings and loan. President Clinton made his opposi- tion clear and the measure would face almost certain veto if it passes the Sen- ate in its present form. Newly elected Prime Minister So- suke Uno said today that he was deeply concerned that China could be isolated internationally if it does not move to end the violence. In the first sentence, change “becomes” to became. In the second sentence, change “passes” to passed. (As an alter- native, make each sentence wholly in- dicative: “restrictions that will apply to Bush if he again becomes . . .” and “the measure will face almost certain veto if it passes. . . . ”) In the third sentence, change “does” to did. The following sentence contains es- sentially the same error: disagreement in mood. The fact that part of it is a quota- tion makes no difference. If an adult picks up their lingo, “teen- agers would consider it contaminated and stop using it,” Chapman says. Change “picks” to picked. (An alterna- tive is to change “would” to will but ex- clude it from the direct quotation: “If an adult picks up their lingo, teen-agers will ‘consider it contaminated. . . . ’ ”) The appended attribution, “Chapman says,” does not affect the main thought. The error in the following example is a superfluous word. It’s recommended that the elderly and those having trouble should stay in- doors. Omit “should.” Alternatively, keep “should” but omit “It’s recommended that.” Using the subjunctive in place of the indicative is a relatively uncommon er- ror, one that is found in a book on word usage. It’s in the very nature of oral com- munication between human beings that much of it be tentative, inexact, finding its way. The statement is presented as a fact. It has none of the elements that call for the subjunctive. Change “be” to is, thereby recasting the sentence in the indicative mood. After the auxiliary verb could, may, might, must, should, or would, some- times the have is erroneously replaced by “of.” See HAVE, HAS, HAD, 2. See also Tense, 4C. SUBSEQUENT TO. See AFTER.

Adjective, adverb; SUCH A. 2. Pronoun; AS SUCH. 3. SUCH AS. 1. Adjective, adverb; SUCH A This sentence is correct: “There is no such thing as a ghost.” After no such, the article “a” or “an” is not needed. Such is usually an adjective, as in the preceding example. It has acquired an adverbial use too. “I never before saw such tall peaks” and “saw peaks so tall” are now equally idiomatic. Some people use such adverbially in sentences like this one, which to others may seem incomplete: “I had such a good meal at that restaurant.” It be- comes complete when we add, for in- stance, “that I intend to go there again tomorrow.” 2. Pronoun; AS SUCH The use of such as a pronoun is re- sisted by grammarians, though it goes back centuries. Among Biblical uses: “and of such [livestock] shall be my hire [wages]” and “Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such [any adulter- ess] should be stoned. . . . ” The critics are vague in scorning “Such is life” or “They serve pizza, spaghetti, ravioli, and such.” One finds it too casual, another too formal. The strongest objection is to such in place of ordinary pronouns, particularly personal pronouns. Accordingly in “I have all- spice and often use such in cooking,” change “such” to it. In “We have a cat and a dog and love such,” change “such” to them, or perhaps just add ani- mals, depending on meaning. This is one of two uses of as such: “The situation is a hot potato and we should treat it as such.” Some critics would replace “as such” with one or that. Others would accept it as id- iomatic. As such is unquestionably an id- iomatic phrase when it means in itself, as in “He craves power as such.” 3. SUCH AS The phrase such as precedes an exam- ple. It is superfluous to add “for exam- ple” / “for instance” / “and the like” / “and so on.” A book says, “The power bases in the music business aren’t con- centrated in any one group (such as, for example, the major agencies . . .).” Delete “for example” and the two com- mas. Such as normally introduces a noun, not a preposition: “They have per- formed in leading cities of Europe, such as in Paris and Rome.” Delete the second in. Another faulty use goes this way: “I brought only such tools that I needed for the job.” Make it such . . . as or change “such” to the. Modern idiom rejects the pairing of such with “that” (or “which” or “who” or “where”) in that type of construction. But such that is proper here: “The rigors were such that most contestants failed to finish.” In the first instance, such precedes the noun; in the second, such follows the noun and a linking verb. SUFFER. That which lacks feeling cannot suffer. Only a living person or creature can suffer. Despite that truism, we hear on the news: A nuclear submarine has suffered some kind of accident in the Norwe- gian Sea. A vessel, even when moving and called “she,” is not animate. Find a substitute for “suffered” (such as been in or had ) or restructure the sentence. (“Some kind of accident has happened to . . .” or “has befallen. . . . ”) From the North Atlantic theater, we move to northern California, where a victim of earth movement “showed city engineers the damage his house has suf- fered” and a temblor struck two play- houses: suffer 401 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 401"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":". . .

SULTRY. Oppressively hot, swelter- ing weather, days, or air may be de- scribed as sultry, particularly if humid. Sultry is applied also to figurative heat, such as feverish passion or temper. That adjective serves loosely in other ways, such as a euphemism for sexy. A movie reviewer so used it: “Jessica . . . looks and sounds so sultry . . . that Roger and Eddie find her equally alluring.” A restaurant reviewer turned to it for help in expressing her fervor for an Ital- ian appetizer: “The sultry eggplant was especially good with the fresh sourdough bread dipped into the marinade.” A flowery writer might metaphorically pic- ture some Mexican or Asian foods as sultry, but the bland eggplant?

Supportive has been an established adjective. It means pro- viding support or help; e.g., a supportive group. Now we hear the faddish phrase “supportive of.” A mayor of New York wrote, “I have always felt very supportive of civil rights.” Before such a circumlocution be- came a popular habit, he might have written simply, “I have always supported civil rights.” The phrase is wishy-washy at best and grammatically dubious. It is like “Lord, be helpful of us” instead of “Lord, help us.” More illustrations follow. John A—— . . . called the book “a pioneering effort. I’m very supportive of the book.” John should have ended with “support- ive” and left out the rest. McCarthy . . . was supportive of this proposal. . . . The rest of the board of direc- tors . . . has been supportive of Mr. A——. . . . The editor of the Hindustan Times, a paper generally supportive of the Government, said. . . . Tightened versions would say, “Mc- Carthy supported this proposal” / “. . . The rest of the board of direc- tors . . . has supported Mr. A——” / “a paper generally supporting the Govern- ment.” Possibly using “supportive of” as a model, some writers have brought forth the abnormity below.

A community had prohibited a demon- stration by a racist group and a come- dian was proposing a compromise: “Any white supremist who wants to enter the square should first be able to spell the word ‘supremist.’ ” The trouble with his joke was that no such word existed. He needed the word supremacist. A supremacist is one who believes in the supremacy of one race or social group or either of the sexes. A common example is that of the white supremacist, a believer in white supremacy; that is, the leading role of the so-called white race. Changing one letter in supremacist gives us suprematist, an adherent of suprematism, an artistic movement em- phasizing abstract, geometric forms. The Russian painter Kazimir Malevich started it in 1913 . He was best known for his painting “Suprematist Composi- tion,” consisting of a white square on a white background. Except for the coinci- dental emphasis on whiteness, supremacists have nothing to do with suprematists. SURE. Being sure (adjective) means having no doubt that something is true or will come about. Thus it was a con- tradiction for a national TV reporter to say (about the possibility of lawsuits that claim discrimination based on looks), “I hope we don’t have these lawsuits, but I’m sure we will.” If he was sure that something would happen, how could he reasonably hope that it would not? A woman called a radio doctor to ex- press fear about possible thyroid cancer. Recommending an examination, he re- marked, “I’m sure it’s not gonna turn out to be anything, but you always want to be sure.” His “sure” was not so sure as hers would be. If he was really sure of her symptom’s benignity, there need not have been any “but.” Uttered by loose lips, “sure” can amount to little more than guessing. Whether it is used strictly or frivolously may not be apparent, so enfeebled has the word become from misuse. To em- phasize certainty, a more reliable adjec- tive may be certain, which implies that one’s conviction is based on evidence or experience. If it is based on faith, con- sider using confident. Sure and secure both originate in the Latin securus, free from care, safe. SURNAME. See LAST NAME and SURNAME. SUSPECTED. See ACCUSED, AL- LEGED etc. SUSTAIN. To sustain a loss or injury is to endure it or experience it. An inani- mate object does not endure or experi- ence anything. Therefore “sustained” does not suit this sentence: Hundreds of San Francisco build- ings may have sustained hidden dam- age in Tuesday’s temblor. . . . ” Better: “. . . may have received ” or “ Hidden damage may have been done to hundreds. . . . ” Some authorities shun sustain, even for people, in the sense of suffering a spe- cific injury. “He sustained a broken arm” is a modern, journalistic locution. They would reserve sustain for a special, traditional meaning: to bear up under, to stand against without yielding; e.g., “An explorer had to sustain hardship.” / “His troops sustained the siege for a month.” Accordingly, to “sustain” an injury is contradictory when it is fatal. sustain 403 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 403"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"Sustain (verb, transitive) has other senses: to maintain, prolong, support, or uphold as valid; e.g., “She sustains my faith in humanity.” / “I had no desire to sustain the conversation.” / “He sustains himself by odd jobs.” / “Objection sus- tained.” See also SUFFER.

Fowler called it “elegant varia- tion,” probably in sarcasm. Usually more silly than elegant, it is a conspicu- ous introduction of synonyms, stemming from the misbelief that repetition per se is undesirable and repeating a word in a sentence or paragraph (or other unit) is an evil. It is characteristic of journalists but not restricted to them. Six newspa- pers, a magazine, and a book supplied the examples in this section. Fifth-seeded Todd Martin beat 10 th-seeded Mark Philippoussis 6 – 3 , 7 – 5 . . . . Sixth-seeded Michael Stich overwhelmed Andrei Medvedev 6 – 4 , 6 – 1 . . . . Defending champion Jana Novotna ousted Anke Huber 6 – 4 , 6 – 4 . In the absence of any clear-cut distinc- tions among the beating, the overwhelm- ing, and the ousting, we must conclude that the three tennis victories were func- tionally equal. As concert halls became bigger, and audiences larger, music became gradu- ally more and more difficult to under- stand at first hearing. Similarly, “bigger” does not appear to differ substantially from “larger” in that excerpt, from a magazine article. On the East Coast, cocaine supplies are dwindling and prices are jumping. On the West Coast, the white powder is readily available but prices have rocketed. In a story about precipitation in the win- ter, “the white powder” may be snow. In the excerpt above, it is probably cocaine. The writer just could not bear to repeat the word. Note too that on the East Coast prices jump, while on the West Coast they rocket. Hernandez said all ivory revenue must go toward the conservation of elephants and development programs for communities whose crops, homes and lives are threatened by the world’s largest land mammal. The writer’s substitute for elephant(s) was “the world’s largest land mammal,” but he could have used them. (Some writers’ favorite elephant substitute is “pachyderm,” a term that includes the hippopotamus, the rhinoceros, and other thick-skinned beasts.) The paragraph below is the fifth in a news story about Suffolk County, New York. At a news conference here, Mr. Halpin said that the bill would cost the county on eastern Long Island businesses millions of dollars for addi- tional worker benefits—principally for eye care—and that it had already discouraged many new companies from settling in Suffolk and made sev- eral existing ones consider relocating. The writer had used the name “Suffolk” three times. He wanted to refer to Suf- folk businesses but felt that he simply 404 swamped 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 404"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"had to find a substitute for Suffolk. So he found it, a phrase of six words, and heedlessly stuck it into a sentence that would be long and complex even with- out it. “Suffolk” appears later in the sen- tence anyway. If the writer had inserted his six-word synonym there, it might be tolerable. As it is, the readers read that “the bill would cost the county on east- ern Long Island businesses,” and they soon have to retrace their steps. Rabies caused the death of a 13 -year- old boy, the first human in San Fran- cisco to die of the rare disease in nearly half a century, health officials have reported. The victim . . . died Dec. 15 but was not diagnosed as having the rare disease until several days later. . . . The writer wanted to avoid repeating “rabies” but seemed to have no qualms about repeating “the rare disease,” which is more conspicuous than the name of the disease and probably unnec- essary, given the frequency. Similarly, in the passage below, “AIDS” conspicuously becomes “the deadly disease” twice and then “the fatal disease.” CHICAGO—Companies must ed- ucate employees about AIDS to pre- vent “groundless hysteria” when a co-worker contracts the deadly dis- ease, the U.S. surgeon general said Tuesday. . . . Koop said company education pro- gram should tell employees how the deadly disease is spread. The fatal disease has no cure. A book of popular science asks, in re- ferring to the change in weight of a ra- dioactive object, “Would not its surface dust off a little, or corrode that much?” The (two) authors appear to have intro- duced “that much” to avoid repeating “a little.” The phrases are almost oppo- sites. In broadcasts, Hawaii has repeatedly become “paradise”; the John F. Kennedy household, “Camelot”; Mars, “the red planet”; Microsoft, “the software gi- ant”; the New York Stock Exchange, “the big board”; Elvis Presley, “the king”; and the U.S. Supreme Court, “the high court.” 2. How it causes confusion The drive to avoid repetition and find a synonym at all costs can result in more than just ungainly expression. The dan- ger of confusing the reader or listener is far more serious than the danger of bor- ing him. In telling what is new, if the writer varies not only that which changes but also that which remains constant, the readers may have trouble grasping what is new. Three press examples follow: Shorter work shifts for young doctors replaced the customary 36 -hour shifts for medical interns and residents. Did hospitals replace “medical interns and residents” with “young doctors” when reducing the work shifts? Probably not; one phrase is probably the writer’s synonym for the other. But if the staff members did not change, why change what we call them? It was not even nec- essary to use nouns twice. A pronoun would have worked: “Shorter work shifts for medical interns and residents replaced their customary 36 -hour shifts.” When a topic is unfamiliar or exotic, readers (or listeners) may not realize that two terms are supposed to mean the same thing.

It is reasonable for readers to think at first that “the substance” is the enzyme. But the context indicates it is alcohol. The writer was just synonymizing and never thought to use the pronoun it. This is about an election in Japan: It also is the first time since the Liberal Democratic Party came into existence in 1955 that the ruling con- servatives face a parliamentary elec- tion as the underdogs. The story never explains outright that the Liberal Democratic Party is the “rul- ing conservatives.” American readers who are uninitiated to Japanese politics and unaccustomed to finding liberals de- scribed as conservatives may be excused if they mistake them for two different parties.

The country had heard many tributes to the late Justice Thur- good Marshall but nothing else quite like a statement by the moderator of a television forum: “His funeral this week marked the end of his life.” It was a type of tautology, a statement that is undeniable but uninformative and usually characterized by the repeti- tion in essence of a thought. It may con- tain contradictory elements, as in a sentence from a well-known book: “This uncertain change toward warmth may go on or it may not.” An American general exhibited tauto- logical mastery. As secretary of state, he addressed the Organization of American States and imparted this intelligence about the Falkland Islands: “It is quite clear that the crisis has reached a critical point.” Later, in a so-called presidential debate, he said, “There are finite limits to what Europe can do,” as though dis- tinguishing them from infinite limits. That last quotation illustrates another meaning of tautology: the unnecessary repetition of a word, phrase, or sen- tence, or its meaning; or an example of such repetition. A synonym is redun- dancy (noun). That which is unnecessar- ily repetitious is redundant (adjective). A term with similar meaning is pleonasm, the use of more words than are neces- sary to express an intended meaning; or an example thereof. (The words are pronounced taut-TOL-uh-gee, re-DUN- dense-see, re-DUN-dent, and PLEA-uh- nazm.) Repetition per se is not wrong; it can be beneficial when it aids clarity. More confusion results from efforts to avoid repetition than from repetition. Here, however, we consider unneces- sary repetition. It may be obvious: “This evening ABC will have a special Prime Time special.” Usually it is somewhat more subtle. When a participant in a televised talk show called a detective in a murder case racially prejudiced, the host jumped in, informing all, “It’s an alleged allega- tion.” No one asked him, “What other kind of allegation is there?” Interviewed on television about a kid- naping, a policeman said, “We’ve had a canine dog in the area, trying to locate the suspects.” The interviewer failed to tautology 407 T 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 407"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"ask him, “What other kind of dog is there?” An anchor woman announced in a national news program, “Washington has been expecting Russia to expel an American diplomat, but so far that hasn’t happened yet.” The sentence did not need both “so far” and “yet.” In a report on a straw poll at a con- vention in Florida, a TV man said, “Each one of those votes cost him [Sena- tor Dole] about $ 1 , 800 apiece.” Either “Each one of” or “apiece” could have been discarded. This is from a newspaper: “The legal defense group’s report said women in particular are being singled out for ha- rassment” (in the military). They “in particular” are being picked on if they are being “singled out.” Another newspaper said the “Party of the Democratic Revolution . . . will likely choose . . . its two-time presidential also- ran in 1988 and 1994 ” to run for mayor of Mexico City. The paper could have left it to the readers to add one and one. Still another paper said a man was convicted of making a “false misrepre- sentation in the sale of a security”—as distinguished from a true misrepresenta- tion? Three hosts of talk shows on a radio station uttered these remarks: (In sup- port of car travel rather than public tran- sit to save time:) “Forty-five minutes is forty-five minutes.” (On commitments made by news media:) “Off the record is off the record.” (Of the president and his aides:) “To the extent that they should be held accountable, they should be held accountable.” Most of us, authors included, are oc- casional tautologists. A book about books tells us, “Every book is a book yet each one is an individual combination of author, content, publisher, timing” (etc.). It is indisputable that a book is a book, a rose is a rose, boys will be boys, business is business, a deal is a deal, and that’s that. See also Twins; Verbosity; and the cross-reference Repetition and its avoid- ance. TEAM OF. See Collective nouns. TEAR, TORE, TORN. A hurricane in Florida was being described for a na- tional radio audience: “There were roofs completely tore up.” “Tore” was wrong. It is standard En- glish only as the past tense of the verb tear: “He tore the book.” The past par- ticiple of tear is torn, which should have been used: “There were roofs completely torn up” (or, better, “Roofs were com- pletely . . .”). Other examples: “He has torn the book” and “The book is torn. ” TEMBLOR and TREMBLER. A temblor is an earthquake. A trembler is someone or something that trembles. To tremble is to shiver or quake, so the words are close enough to be easily con- fused. In commenting on a terrorist attack on U.S. servicemen in Saudi Arabia, a panelist on a television forum sought a picturesque metaphor. U.S. forces were “in a deep fault between the twentieth century and the eleventh century,” he said. “This was a trembler.” He meant it was a temblor. Both words seem to have originated in the Latin tremulus, trembling. But tem- blor came via Spanish, in which it means a tremor or shiver; while tremble(r) came via French, in which trembler means to tremble. Tense. 1. Definitions. 2.

Tell the story in the past or present, not both. 1. Definitions Tense is a form of a verb that indicates the time of an action: past, present, or 408 team of 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 408"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"future. It usually says something also about the completion or continuation of the action. Mistakes in tense are rife in print, let alone speech. We will turn to illustrations in later sections, headed by suggestions for the orderly use of tenses. Here we list the main tenses and some typical uses. A. The past tense (also called the preterit or preterite ). It indicates that an action occurred in the past (“She went home an hour ago”) or that a state or condition existed in the past (“It was the best of times”). B. The present tense. It indicates that an action occurs now (“The earth revolves around the sun” / “He is here”) or occurs customarily (“I go to work daily”) or that something exists now (“The house still stands”). C. The future tense. It indicates that an action is going to take place. (“A courier will deliver the letter.” / “I’ll be there.”) D. The perfect tenses. Perfect in grammar indicates when an action was, is, or will be completed. Three are as follows: • The past perfect tense (or pluperfect )—the action was completed before a given time in the past or before a certain other occurrence. (“They had fled Germany by the time the war started.”) • The present perfect tense—the action is completed now. This tense links the past with the present. It may refer to an action or actions that began in the past, continuing or recurring until the present. (“Business has been good.” / “Man has hunted since prehistoric times.”) Or it may refer to a past action that affects the present. (“They have given the police clues.”) • The future perfect tense—the action will be completed in the future, whether or not it has already started. (“The staff will have totaled all the receipts by tomorrow noon.”) E. The progressive tenses (or pro- gressive forms ). They indicate that an action was, is, or will be continuing. (“I was running.” / “The Lees are vis- iting us.” / “He will be singing.” Some general principles, quotations, and commentary follow. The discussions here concern the indicative mood; that is, the ordinary verb form for communi- cating information. For other forms, consult Mood; Subjunctive. The basic form of a verb is discussed under Infini- tive, which includes 3, the perfect infini- tive. See also Verbs. 2. Don’t swap tenses in the middle of a sentence It seems that the writer of the follow- ing sentence, a columnist, could not de- cide whether to tell his story in the past tense or the present tense, so he used both. He then took off at breakneck speed and as I zoomed down the road at 60 mph this guy pulls alongside and points at the laundry. The passage is fairly clear but untidy. It is as though the writer wore one black shoe and one white. He should have cho- sen one tense or the other and stuck to it, at least for the duration of the sentence. (A comma after “ 60 mph” would have helped also.) The quotation below should have been entirely in the past tense. It is not plausible the way it stands. ...W illiam Lowe, president of I.B.M.’s entry systems division, said earlier this year that the company is investing as much in future RISC- based products as it has put into its PS/ 2 personal computer line. tense 409 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 409"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"“Earlier this year,” when he talked about then current spending, he “said . . . that the company was investing” as much in the future products “as it had put into” the personal computer line. We do not know what the company “is invest- ing” now or has invested since “earlier this year.” Such shifting from past to present or to future is common in the popular press, and it is not always a product of ignorance. On one newspaper, the city editor told us staff members that it was considered ungrammatical to write that way, but he instructed us to do it any- how. In a normal sentence, if the main verb is in the past, the verb of a dependent clause also goes in the past. “He said [main verb] that he did [dependent verb].” In the present, “He says that he does ” is correct. “He said that he does ” is incorrect and illogical. A book mixes the past and the pre- sent: Supper of desert survival rations, de- hydrated stew and rice, was delicious when you’re hungry. “Was” clashes with the contracted are in “you’re.” Make it either “ is delicious when you’re hungry” or “was delicious when you were hungry.” The following passage adds an awk- ward mixture of plural and singular to its shift from past to present. But all five books became best sell- ers. And while the chain stores even- tually jumped aboard the sales bandwagon, it was independent bookstores that are responsible for their success. Better: “. . . it was the independent bookstore that was responsible . . .” or “independent bookstores were responsi- ble. . . . ” (And change “their” to the books’ so that no one thinks “their” refers to “the chain store.”) Here an adverb pertaining to the pre- sent purports to modify a verb in the past: Currently, 30 people on Death Row nationwide committed murder when they were under 18 . Opening the sentence with “currently” sets the scene in the present for the whole sentence. Therefore the main verb cannot be “committed” or any other verb in the past. Place “currently” after “people,” or else revise the rest of the sentence. One possible revision adds two words: “Currently, 30 people who com- mitted murder when they were under 18 are on Death Row nationwide.” An attribution, like he said or she said, parenthetically inserted in a sen- tence, usually does not affect the other verbs. This excerpt is acceptable: “To- ward that end, she explained, DHS is working with . . . universities. . . . ” While generally favoring consistency in tense, most authorities would make an exception for supposed timeless truths: “He said that the universe is fi- nite,” rather than “ was finite.” / “It showed that crime does not pay,” rather than “ did not pay.” Some, more conser- vative, would not make that exception. You may decide for yourself. See also 6; Anachronism, 2. 3. Fit quoted and nonquoted parts to- gether Parts of a sentence must fit together grammatically, whether or not some of it is a quotation. In the second sentence below, the quoted part does not match the non- quoted part. The passage is from a his- tory book. No one, Tory or Whig, could design a British victory out of what had hap- 410 tense 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 410"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"pened at Lexington and Concord. Nor had the peasants “ran for their lives.” The two halves of the second sentence do not jibe. It starts out in one tense (pluperfect) and finishes in another (preterit). You may not say the peasants “had . . . ran. . . . ” A change like this would put the whole sentence in one tense, yet keep the quotation intact: Nor was it true that the peasants “ran for their lives.” An alternative would be to keep the first half of the sentence but change the quo- tation, making it indirect: Nor had the peasants run for their lives. The quotation marks must be removed because the quotation no longer is exact. (Anyway, the book fails to indicate who is being quoted.) 4. Look to the future grammatically A. WILL and SHALL The modern use of the future tense is fairly easy. Will with an infinitive usually does the job. “When will they ever learn?” / “I will be there with bells on.” / “You will do fine.” In colloquial speech only half of will may be needed: “I’ll be seeing you.” The present can indicate the future in some constructions: “He per- forms here tomorrow.” So can a progres- sive tense: “He will be performing here” or “He is going to perform here” (which becomes, in loose colloquial speech, “He’s gonna perfor m . . .”). Shall usually implies determination or legal requirement. “We shall overcome.” / “It shall be unlawful to. . . . ” Now and then shall is otherwise needed: “Shall we dance?” / “Shall I draw up the papers?” (The formal use of the two words, now obsolete in the United States and even disappearing in England, prescribed shall for the simple future in the first per- son and for determination, obligation, inevitability, etc. in the second or third person. Will was used the other way: for the simple future in the second or third person and for determination etc. in the first person.) B. Dependent clauses Two types of recurrent mistakes con- cern a dependent, or subordinate, clause: • Repeating will in a dependent clause instead of using the present tense. “The administration of Mayor Harris will end at noon tomorrow when John Bradley will take office as mayor.” The second “will” is superfluous. Change “will take” to takes. • Using will in a dependent clause when the main verb is in the past tense. “Edison predicted that he will perfect the incandescent lamp.” Inasmuch as predicted is in the past tense, will has to go in the past tense too; its past tense is would. “Edison predicted that he would. . . . ” It is the future from his standpoint, years ago. “Will”—the future from our standpoint—makes no sense. Similarly, “. . . Smythe . . . was told that he will be sent back to . . . Maze Prison” needs correction: “was told that he would be sent back.” The same principle holds when the future is suggested in other ways: “K—— said he plans to present the case to the district attorney.” / “M—— said she plans to fight the denial in court if necessary.” Change “plans” to planned. We know their plans at the time they were interviewed, but their plans may have changed by now. Expect, forecast, intend, look forward to, tense 411 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 411"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"and predict are among other verbs that suggest the future. C. Conditional sentences Another problem concerns the condi- tional sentence: a sentence in which a fu- ture action depends on something else happening. The problem takes two forms: • Mixing “will” and some verb in the past subjunctive, which are incompatible: But the assistance will be sus- pended late in November if any of the major Congressional commit- tees dealing with the money ob- jected to its continuation. Either change “objected” to objects or change “will” to would. The latter gives us the subjunctive mood. ( See Mood; Subjunctive. ) Such use of would should not be confused with would as the past tense of will in the indicative mood, the ordinary verb form. • Mixing the subjunctive “would” and some verb in the indicative, which are incompatible: The government estimates that Hong Kong . . . would lose as many as 20 , 000 jobs if Bush doesn’t extend the trading agree- ment. This time, “would” should be will. An alternative is to change “doesn’t” to didn’t or did not. D. Distortion of meaning More than grammatical tidiness may be involved. Confusion of tenses made the two excerpts opaque and misleading. The directors of the Nicaraguan Re- sistance, the Contra alliance, said at Sapoa they will present the govern- ment with a list of prisoners that they had wanted liberated yesterday. To be compatible with “said,” which is in the past tense, “will” should go in the past tense: would. “Will” says some- thing is going to happen. In actuality, the presentation of the list may be com- pleted already. A further correction (this foreshadows section 5 ) is to omit “had.” It wrongly implies that the directors’ de- sire for a liberation preceded the Sapoa event, five days ago, and then ended. The tenses below are so badly con- founded that the time of the main action is not apparent. Upon completion of that term, [Judge] Jackson put him on super- vised probation for a year, meaning that he must report regularly to a pro- bation officer and be subject to peri- odic drug tests. It seems to be saying that two events oc- curred in the past; that after the convict finished serving his term, the judge put him on probation. That is not the in- tended meaning. The phrase “Upon completion of that term” should have been followed by a clause like this, in the future tense: “he will be on supervised probation.” Instead, the phrase is fol- lowed by the irrelevant clause “Jackson put him . . . ,” which falsely unites with it. 5. Perfect your perfect tenses A. Be sure of the participle and use it with an H-word The past perfect tense uses ( 1 ) had and ( 2 ) the past participle of a verb. (“They had eaten, so they were not hun- gry.”) The present perfect tense uses ( 1 ) have or has and ( 2 ) the past participle of a verb. (“I have worn this suit for years.” / “She has shown courage.” 412 tense 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 412"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"H. L. Mencken listed over 100 past participles (or “perfect participles”) that he found misused in “common” or “vul- gar” American speech. Often they were used in place of the past tense; for in- stance, “I been” and “I done” instead of I was and I did. He said such misuse was an old practice, common in other En- glish dialects but particularly well marked in the American dialect. The opposite, the use of the past tense in place of the past participle, is another old practice. At one time, Mencken wrote, “even the best writers were ap- parently unconscious of its inelegance”: Shakespeare’s plays contain such forms as “I have wrote ” / “I am mistook ” / and “he has rode. ” ( Written, mistaken, and ridden are now standard.) Such lapses are rare in published ma- terial nowadays but not in oral speech. In broadcasts a Washington state legisla- tor and a Washington, D.C., correspon- dent for a newspaper muffed has run and have run respectively: “The fact that the child has ran away could be for any number of reasons.” / “He [Gingrich] would never have ran for president.” The sentences below were uttered by members of the general public and heard on the air. (Correct forms are in brack- ets.) “I must have ate [eaten] lunch with fifteen MPD patients.” / “It shouldn’t have broke [broken] like that.” / “Maybe they should have gave [given] him some treatment program.” / “She had just took [taken] her car to the car wash.” Each speaker wrongly used a past tense in place of a past participle. Another erred the opposite way: “I looked over to the left and I seen [saw] a tornado.” Sometimes an incorrect participle gets into print: Egypt’s chief religious official has also spoke on behalf of Abu Zeid, say- ing he could not be ordered to di- vorce. . . . Although “spoke” was accepted as the past participle of speak from the four- teenth to eighteenth centuries, now it is spoken. Spoke is the past tense. A travel book leaves out the participle altogether: but it is quite possible thousands of F-M listeners have or will hear it from this exact spot. “Have” does not go with “hear.” A cor- rection: “have heard or will hear. . . . ” (A hyphen in FM is unnecessary.) See also Participles. B. Do not confuse the sequence of events A sequence of events is subject to con- fusion in the press. When a writer fails to make it clear which events came first, second, and third, the problem may amount to shortcomings in the use of the perfect tenses. An account of a shooting rampage contains this passage: Bobby S——, 20 , was in fair condi- tion at Denver General Hospital. He escaped from the restaurant and ran to nearby apartments to call police. The escape and the run took place before his stay in the hospital. Therefore the past perfect (not the past ) is the tense to use: “He had escaped from the restau- rant and run. . . . ” (Following that sen- tence, if a still earlier event was described, the past perfect tense would be used again; for instance, “He had been cleaning the kitchen when the shooting began.”) Conversely, the next sentence uses the past perfect tense unnecessarily in lieu of a simple past tense. His client and the two cops were yelling and cursing when the lieu- tenant on duty showed up. Incredibly, less than a minute later, the lieutenant tense 413 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 413"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"had hauled off and punched W—— in the face. The punching followed the yelling and cursing. Therefore it is most clearly de- scribed in the past tense. For example: “Incredibly, within a minute, the lieu- tenant hauled off. . . . ” Next, the sequence of two events is mistakenly reversed by the use of the present perfect instead of the past per- fect: The Mohajir group called the strike to demand the release of more than 100 of its workers it says have been kidnaped by members of the Pakistan Students Federation. . . . The alleged kidnaping came first; then the Mohajir group called the strike and talked. So change “have been kidnaped” to “ had been kidnaped.” (Still better: “. . . 100 of its workers who, it said, had been kidnaped”—adding the relative pronoun and placing the talking with the striking.) C. Mind your P’s and H’s The press often shows misunderstand- ing of the perfect tenses and their rela- tion to the past and present. Sometimes the problem is the intrusion of a certain word or phrase. F.B.I. officials have previously ac- knowledged that the agency recruited an informer . . . to join Cispes. The present perfect tense is functionally equivalent to the present tense. Its have or has does not mix with “previously” or “in the past.” Here are three alterna- tive ways to repair the sample sentence: 1 . Omit “previously,” using the present perfect correctly: “F.B.I. officials have acknowledged. . . . ” (They made the acknowledgment at an indefinite time before this moment.) 2 . Omit “have” and insert had before “recruited”: “F.B.I. officials previ- ously acknowledged [they did so in the past ] that the agency had recruited an informer. . . . ” (The phrase had recruited is in the past perfect. The agency had done the recruiting be- fore the officials did the acknowledg- ing.) 3 . Change “have” to had and insert had before “recruited,” using the past per- fect twice: “F.B.I. officials had previ- ously acknowledged that the agency had recruited. . . . ” (Again the recruit- ing preceded the acknowledging. The officials had done the acknowledging before something else happened: viz. the latest news was made public.) “Previously” is unnecessary with the past perfect but may be used for extra clarity. To combine have or has with “pre- viously” or “in the past” creates a monstrous nontense. (Dare we dub it the highly imperfect? ) A favorite of writers of scientific papers, it has stum- bled its way into the popular press as well. Contra spokesmen have previously stated they use Claymore mines. . . . Omit “previously.” As an alternative, omit “have” and put “use” in the past tense: “Contra spokesmen previously stated they used. . . . ” The private meeting, which hasn’t been disclosed previously, could cre- ate additional political and legal prob- lems for the embattled attorney general. . . . In the past, Mr. Meese has main- tained he had an “extremely limited” role with the pipeline. . . . In the upper sentence, “previously” could well be changed to until now. In the lower, leave out “In the past.” 414 tense 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 414"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"Mr. Dukakis, displaying more hu- mor and emotion than he has in the past, poked fun at the criticism of his lack of charisma. The sentence is doubly wrong. The aux- iliary verb “has” should be changed to had. Even so, it is not enough. What verb links up with it? Not “displaying.” Make it “. . . than he had displayed. . . .” D. Stay in the right time frame The three press sentences below make essentially the same mistake: shifting back in time from the present perfect tense. It is functionally equivalent to the present tense. The chorus of critical statements about Colonel North, largely from Administration officials, has reached such a crescendo that Elliott Abrams, the Assistant Secretary of State for In- ter-American affairs, was moved to offer a spirited defense. Change “was moved” to “ has been moved.” The action started in the past, but it has continued until approximately the present, and the present cannot affect the past. ( See also CRESCENDO. ) MGM-UA has produced few films lately while its controlling share- holder . . . sought a buyer. Make it “ has sought. . . . ” The two ac- tions have gone on at about the same time. . . . The group tried to restore order after a demonstration on Saturday night got out of control, and had later provided safe escort for endangered Americans. Scrap “had.” The escort was provided later, not earlier; so the past perfect is un- warranted. The present perfect tense in the first clause of the second sentence below does not belong there. The past tense is used elsewhere throughout the passage, from a newspaper story. For a while it appeared that the par- ties would simply be canceled. . . . But as the Emperor’s blood pressure has risen and fallen in twice-daily read- ings, a consensus slowly emerged. Parties were all right, as long as no one had too much fun. The consensus “emerged” in the past “as”—at the same time that—the Em- peror’s blood pressure rose and fell in the past. There is no reason here to link the action of the past to the present, which is what the present perfect tense does. Similarly, the present perfect is unwar- ranted in this sentence, from a book of essays: . . . Nearly all the linguistic tendencies of the present day have been displayed in earlier centuries. . . . Change “have been” to were, in the past tense. “Earlier centuries” are history. E. Watch out for a change in meaning In the sample below, an excerpt from a newspaper story about an election in Haiti, the use of a wrong tense reverses the meaning intended to be conveyed. “The election process was great,” Carter said, playing down the techni- cal glitches as not surprising in a country that has never had a totally free election. “. . . Has never had” indicates that the country never had a totally free election up to the time that the sentence was written. It was written on the day after an election was held. Therefore one could logically conclude from the ex- cerpt that the election was not totally free. But the context suggests the oppo- tense 415 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 415"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"site. A correction is in order. Omit “has,” so that the action is in the past tense; and, to leave no doubt as to the meaning, put in a qualifying word or phrase: “. . . a country that never before had a totally free election” or “. . . a country that never had a totally free elec- tion until yesterday.” A television reporter’s sloppy use of tense risked creating misunderstanding in an inflammable international atmo- sphere. He spoke of a recently negoti- ated agreement to provide access to all sites in Iraq for weapons inspection, “something Iraq has refused to do.” Us- ing “has”—the present perfect —incor- rectly implied a current refusal by Iraq, contrary to its agreement. Using had — the past perfect —would have correctly indicated Iraq’s refusal before the agree- ment was reached. 6. Tell the story in the past or present, not both Even when individual sentences are grammatical, a passage may be stylisti- cally flawed when tenses shift from sen- tence to sentence. Three books provide examples. (Emphasis is added.) The paragraph below vacillates from past to present, from present to past, as though the author could not make up his mind. During the first period of the renais- sance madrigal . . . the principal lead- ers were the Flemish musicians who had settled in Italy. The composer’s chief concern at this stage is to give pleasure to the performers. . . . In its middle phase . . . the renaissance madrigal becomes a conscious art form. . . . Both Lassus and Palest- rina . . . enriched the literature of the form during these years. [ See also THESE and THOSE. ] The historical present —that is, the present tense used to tell of past events— is an established rhetorical device. It suits not only historical accounts but also descriptions of books and sum- maries of dramatic and literary plots. If chosen, it is generally best to continue it till the story is over. Another author shifts from future to present (acceptable) to past (unaccept- able) in one sentence. The course we will follow begins just before World War I; it was the recog- nition of the discontinuous behavior of the atom, the quantum theory. Change “was” to is. Either present or past —but not both—would be appropriate in the final example. Wagner in “The Ring” employs six harps; and Berlioz, of course, made liberal use of the instrument. [ See also OF COURSE, 2. ] Change either “employs” to employed or “made” to makes. TESTAMENT and TESTIMONY. A testament is a will. In modern use it is relegated to the legal phrase last will and testament, which is redundant but well established. Testimony is evidence, particularly a statement made by a witness under oath in a court. It can be used figuratively: “This gift bears testimony of my love.” The two words have significance in Biblical theology. Testament: a covenant, a promise by God to man; hence the Old Testament and New Testament. Testi- mony: the decalogue or other precepts of God. Both originating in the Latin testis, a witness, they have been differentiated over the centuries but sometimes con- fused in contemporary times. Occasion- ally “testament” is used when testimony is meant, and some dictionaries condone the mix-up. On network television a reporter de- 416 testament and testimony 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 416"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"scribed the scene of a ship accident at New Orleans. For now it is wedged between a pedestrian playland and a busy com- mercial route. There it sits, a glaring testament that a river offers the best of both worlds and shows no mercy when those worlds collide. Her use of “testament,” in lieu of testi- mony, was either a lapse or an instance of poetic license. THAN. 1. Confused with THEN. 2. With various words. 1. Confused with THEN The mistake in both of these pub- lished sentences would not have been considered a mistake a few centuries ago: “. . . Women have smaller brains then men by an average of 10 percent.” / “Time and his genius for bureaucracy taught him . . . to be a monarch rather then a representative.” The writers (of articles condemning an anthropology professor and an FBI director respec- tively) probably know better; inadver- tence or typographical error could be to blame. Than has been spelled differently from then since about 1700 . Here are other differences between the words: • Than is a conjunction, a connecting word, in a sentence expressing comparison (“John is faster than Fred”), preference (“I would rather be right than be president”), or difference or exception (“He said nothing, other than his name, rank, and serial number”). • Then can be a noun, meaning a particular time (“Until then, let’s keep in touch”). Then can be also an adverb, meaning at a certain time in the past (“She was thinner then”), next (“Then he drew his sword”), in that case (“Then why should I go?”), or moreover (“These shoes fit well, and then they’re comfortable”). In careful speech, they are pro- nounced differently, than rhyming with can; and then rhyming with pen. Speak- ing hastily, people often pronounce both like then. 2. With various words A. “AS” A comparison using as and a compar- ison using than do not mix. The idioms are confused in these grim statistical items from television news: “The rate of crib deaths is twice as high for black in- fants than for whites.” / “. . . A child is fourteen times as likely to die of gunshot wounds in this country than in Northern Ireland.” Each “than” should be as: “as high . . . as” / “as likely . . . as. ” Than would be right in a construction like this: “Ford grew richer than Croe- sus.” Or this: “It’s more popular than any other novel in print.” Than com- monly follows ( 1 ) an adjective with the suffix -er or ( 2 ) the adverb more or less plus an adjective. See also AS, 3. B. “DIFFERENT” Phrases like brighter than and louder than are proper, containing compara- tives. It is incorrect to say, “Donkeys are different than mules.” Different from is the accepted idiom. Different is not a comparative. See also DIFFERENT, 1. C. Personal pronouns A common puzzle is the choice be- tween than I and than me, between than we and than us, and so on. The choice of pronoun depends on its function in the than clause. In “Myrtle plays better than he does” no one disputes the he; it is the subject of the verb does. Now what if that verb is dropped? Though unexpressed, it is un- derstood. The sentence “Myrtle plays than 417 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 417"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"better than he” (that is, than he does ) construes he as the subject of that unex- pressed verb. In “The company rewarded nobody more than him” (that is, than the com- pany rewarded him), him is construed as an object of an unexpressed subject and verb. See also Pronouns, 10, especially E. D. RATHER; “PREFER” “Rather” sometimes is superfluous before than: “I’m more concerned with affirming a principle rather than settling the case.” Being a comparative, more goes with than. “Rather,” a comparative adverb, becomes redundant. At times rather than is correct but a verb form that follows is questionable: “We will depend on our own staff, rather than turning [?] to the national of- fice.” Change “turning” to turn. As a conjunction, than ordinarily links paral- lel elements: “Johnny is playing rather than studying.” / “He runs rather than walks.” / “I slept rather than worked.” / “They chose to call rather than write [or “to write”]. There is a trend, however, toward treating rather than as a preposi- tion, in the manner of this book excerpt: “James delivered the address himself, rather than falling [fell?] back on inexpe- rienced theological students.” Some grammarians accept the -ing form as id- iomatic, especially at the start of a sen- tence: “Rather than getting fired, I quit my job.” Prefer should not be followed by than or rather than. Normally you prefer one thing to another: “I prefer chocolate to vanilla.” E. SOONER; “HARDLY” or “SCARCELY” Than often follows a comparative ad- jective or adverb: “He looks bigger than you.” / “It goes faster than any other car.” Sooner is a comparative adverb, of- ten followed by than. Here the earliness of two actions are being compared, cor- rectly: “No sooner had we arrived than the show started.” To substitute “when” is an error. Confusion with hardly or scarcely, neither of which is a compara- tive, appears to be at the root. This is correct: “Hardly [or “scarcely”] had we arrived when the show started.” To substitute “than” is an error. THAN ANY. See ANY, 1. THANK, THANKS. The president of Bolivia was quoted (although in which language and under what circum- stances he spoke was not stated): Bolivia’s unemployment rate stands at 23 percent, thanks to the currency devaluation and other “brutal” eco- nomic reforms imposed on the coun- try by the World Bank to reduce the country’s roughly $ 4 billion foreign debt, Zamora says. No one is likely to offer thanks for an unemployment rate of 23 percent, unless one’s intention is bitter sarcasm or the hiring of cheap labor. Neither accounts for the statement, judging from the con- text and the word “brutal” (rather than, say, “kindly”). You would not expect anyone to offer thanks for the collapse of a road either. A television announcer said in a preview of the news, “Highway number 101 col- lapses near Salinas, thanks to the floods of ’ 97 .” At least three dictionaries define thanks to as “thanks be given to.” For a secondary definition, they offer such phrases as “on account of,” “owing to,” and “as a result of.” But plainly it is not always appropriate to replace them with thanks to. Thanks (noun, plural) is an expres- 418 than any 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 418"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"sion of gratitude. To tell someone thanks (interjection) is to say thank you infor- mally. To thank (verb, transitive) is to ex- press gratitude (to someone or some- thing). Occasionally it can mean to blame, when used in a sarcastic sense: “We have ourselves to thank for the de- feat.” One dictionary’s alternative defini- tion of thank as “blame”—with no mention of its special, sarcastic mean- ing—can be misleading.

Anti-THAT prejudice; unidiomatic sentences Some publications and press services harbor an irrational prejudice. They are that- haters. They consider that (as a con- junction or relative pronoun, introduc- ing a clause) to be usually unnecessary. In their style books, they instruct their writers to do without it whenever possi- ble. Sometimes it may indeed be possible to omit that; for instance, after said and a few other verbs: “She said the money was safe.” / “He thinks the car is defec- tive.” Some clauses of other construction may hold together idiomatically without that: “This is the school I attended.” On the other hand, unless one has orders to the contrary, it usually cannot hurt to put it in: “This is the house that Jack built.” Often the mass media print or broad- cast sentences that are unidiomatic with- out that. Although the meaning is understood in the following four sen- tences, the clauses in each do not hold together gracefully. An asterisk indicates the spot where one would normally con- nect them with that. [A movie criticism on television:] He is jealous * she has made a new male friend. [A television report:] For those who died [on the U.S.S. Iowa ], the thought * it was not an accident only deep- ened the tragedy. [A newspaper item:] . . . She arrived at court for a jury trial on charges * she slapped a Beverly Hills motorcycle cop. [A newspaper column:] . . . Their [Democrats’] lone window of oppor- tunity is the voters’ sense * they’re be- ing left out. See also THAT and WHICH; WHO, THAT, and WHICH. 2. Errors of omission: wrong road, am- biguity The absence of that is more serious in certain sentences in which a verb, such as believes or reported, has a clause as its direct object. Omitting that after the verb can make a fragment of the clause falsely appear to be the direct object. The reader may be sent down the wrong road and have to start the sentence again. The first two of three press examples are from a newspaper that is not one of the that- haters and cautions its staff members against just this sort of thing. At the same time, he said, he believes the people he has met since coming to the United States last week have been surprised at “our openness, our friendliness and our desire to bring peace to the entire world.” The company reported 47 percent of those who had taken the test had failed because of admitted transgres- sions or attitudes. that 419 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 419"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"Although acknowledging New Mexico, like most states, offers a “fair reporting privilege” shield from libel lawsuits, the judge said the privilege did not apply because the Journal was reporting on a statement it itself had made. In the first example, “believes” seems at first to have “the people” as its object. “He believes the people he has met since coming to the United States last week” forms a false thought—one that is plau- sible until “have been surprised” comes along. Following “believes” with that would have prevented the problem. In the next two examples, “The com- pany reported 47 percent of those who had taken the test” and “Although ac- knowledging New Mexico” also form false thoughts. “Reported” and “ac- knowledging” should each be followed by that. Omitting that can render a sentence ambiguous when time is an element: “The Governor said on June 30 the state’s debt stood at $ 57 million.” If (a) he was telling what the size of the debt was on that day, follow “said” with that. But if (b) that was the day when he said it, follow “ 30 ” with that. (Another way to correct the sentence is to to put “on June 30 ” [a] at the end or [b] at the be- ginning.) See also ASSURE (etc.), 2. 3. Need for a pair; AND THAT, BUT THAT A single that may not be enough in a sentence containing a series of compara- ble clauses. Doctors say that some home remedies help but others may be harmful. Who is saying “others may be harmful”? If it is the doctors, follow “but” with that. If it is the person speaking, make that fact clear; e.g., “But evidence shows that others. . . . ” When the phrase but that or and that does begin a clause, normally the that parallels a that in the previous clause. Each of these two sample sentences omits the first that: Mr. Bush said “no specific mission” was under discussion, but that Mr. Reagan was being kept informed. . . . He said the imagery of the Pales- tinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip had inspired some Jordanians and that other pres- sures were at work. “. . . Said that ” would balance each sen- tence better. Although the meaning may be understandable without that, a tidier sentence could be easier to read. This is particularly true for sentences that are longer and more complicated: Mr. Bush said the arrangement, which follows months of delicate ne- gotiations with Japan, would safe- guard sensitive computer software and that American companies would be guaranteed roughly 40 percent of the production work on the new jet fighter. Some readers probably glanced back to see what “and that” referred to. “Mr. Bush said that ” would have helped them. How could it have hurt? A book on relativity fails to put ele- ments of a sentence in proper relation. Two hypothetical space ships reach rela- tive speeds of light. . . . Observers on each ship would think the other ship had shrunk to zero in length, acquired an infinite mass, and that time on the other ship had slowed to a full stop! To follow “think” with that would begin to improve the sentence. (It contains a defective series. Replace the first comma with and.

Unnecessary THATs That is usually unnecessary before a direct quotation that is complete or starts at the beginning: Shakespeare wrote, “Neither a bor- rower nor a lender be; For loan oft loses both itself and friend, And bor- rowing dulls the edge of husbandry.” Before a fragment of a direct quota- tion, that may be desirable: Shakespeare wrote that “borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.” Take care, however, that the that is not inside the quotation marks. This is wrong: Shakespeare wrote “that borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.” Sometimes a second “that” is erro- neously inserted in a sentence when its function is already performed by the first that: The party contends that as long as the present government remains in power that the nation will not mend its shat- tered economy. “. . . Contends that” includes everything that follows, because all of it is one thought. A second that is superfluous. See also THAT, ALL THAT. THAT, ALL THAT. This is a British import of recent decades, an illogical col- loquialism that should dispel any notion that the best English must come from England. It is the slovenly use of “that”—often preceded by a meaning- less “all”—usually after a negative. When used properly as an adverb, that means to the extent or degree stated or indicated. For instance, “The paper says 5 , 000 people attended, but I don’t think that many were there.” A columnist told of people’s fears dur- ing a gale and added, “There weren’t that many people using umbrellas.” How many people are “that many”? The preceding paragraphs did not state or indicate any number, so “that” did not refer to anything. It should have been discarded. A book of popular science says, “. . . The actual telescopic effect is not that difficult to discover” and “Our daily understanding of our actions is not that far from a scientific account.” Noth- ing was said about difficulty of discov- ery. Nothing was said about distance from science. “That” could have been omitted both times without sacrificing any meaning. No standards of coldness, difference, time, or harm had come up when a net- work newscaster said illogically, “It wasn’t warm, but it wasn’t that cold”; a columnist wrote, “In my opinion, men and women are really not that differ- ent”; and an article said: . . . It didn’t take that long [for a pres- idential candidate to use a slanderous rumor]. . . . The last week’s events may not have been that harmful. Where were the editors to ask: How harmful? How long? How different? How cold? How far? How difficult? Some of them were putting vague that ’s of their own into headlines: “For Corn Belt Farmers, Oat Bran Isn’t That Chic.” Placing “all” before a misused “that” just adds another superfluous word, one that can sometimes be misleading. The two words were paired legitimately in a question asked by a television reporter, “Why would he want to give Democrats that, all that 421 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 421"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"all that money?” All (adverb), meaning the entire amount (of), modified that (adjective), referring to a sum previously mentioned. The two words together modified money (noun). But “all that” was superfluous in an editorial: “Voters do not always take elections for the European Parliament all that seriously. . . . ” And an autobiogra- phy could have omitted the phrase five times; examples: “. . . The old man had not done all that badly. . . . I was not all that distressed. . . . ” “All that” contradicted a previous statement in each of three articles. One reported layoffs and declining profits at a television network and then added: And according to . . . a media consult- ing firm, . . . the outlook is not all that bright. If the writer had painted a bright picture but wanted to introduce some ominous fact, he could reasonably say “the out- look is not all that bright.” These are contradictory excerpts from a movie review and a record review: . . . Dodge is a fairly boring guy and his co-workers aren’t all that in- teresting either. Sales have slumped in recent times, owing partly to poor-quality sound. Most of his recordings did not sound all that good when newly made in NBC’s drably dry Studio 8 H. The expression introduces another opportunity for misunderstanding to the language. A headline dispensed a vague message: Air bags not all that safe, studies say. If “not all,” are some? And how safe is “that safe”? A review of a television se- ries compared it with other series and said, “These guys aren’t all that much fun.” Are some of them? And this is from a news story: A 69 -year-old enthusiast of more rapid liberalization, Mr. Zhao had not been all that popular recently. . . . The story did not say anything earlier about popularity; thus it provided no standard for gauging what “all that” meant. Had Mr. Zhao not been very popular? Had he not been popular at all? Was his popularity down to 35 per- cent? We have to guess. (We have to guess also what his age or liberalization policy has to do with his popularity. See Modifiers, 2. ) What has become popular is the sub- stitution of “that” or “all that” for fac- tual information. People holding a casual conversation or even the writer of a subjective column on some trivial sub- ject may get away with it. It stands out sorely in a sober presentation of news or other facts. The newspaper last quoted has run a periodic column by a maven in word us- age, who should be expected to set us straight. This is an excerpt: “What, then, do you do when strong becomes pejora- tive and weak is not all that bad?” A book by a self-styled word wizard uses an empty “that” term six times. In the example, a study on frequently used words is discussed: The front-runners, whatever their order, should not be all that different today or any day. Our English, writ- ten or spoken, doesn’t change all that much. The author is evidently unaware of at least one change: the spread of a faddish expression that he uses twice in one paragraph. Its insidious effects are manifested 422 that, all that 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 422"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"four times in a compilation by a writer known for his sophisticated vocabulary: “. . .

The jokes in the book are not in the main that great, not all that creative.” How the terms differ and just what they mean are anyone’s guess. In a book for writers and editors, the problem is somewhat different; a stan- dard for comparison is given: “Com- pared to a number of other professions, editing hasn’t really been around all that long.” Drop “all that.” The opening phrase makes another comparative mod- ifier redundant. ( See also COMPARED TO and COMPARED WITH, 1; REALLY. ) The final quotation is from a maga- zine essay by a professor of English, protesting the lowering of standards of behavior: “. . . Common decency has not been all that common for long stretches of human history.” May one also protest the lowering of standards of English usage and all that fuzziness? THAT and WHICH. 1. The differ- ence. 2. Indiscriminate WHICH; mix-up of THAT and WHICH. 3. “THAT” in place of WHICH. 4. Versions of a fa- mous phrase. 1. The difference Two book titles, The Light That Failed and The Mouse That Roared, help to illustrate the distinction between that and which (used as relative pro- nouns). That seemed to the authors to be the natural word to use. The books were not called The Light Which Failed and The Mouse Which Roared. The titles would have appeared stilted had they contained “Which.” Furthermore, to many readers That firmly ties Light to Failed, and Mouse to Roared. “Which” would suit a sentence like this: “The light, which failed only once, has long been a reliable beacon for sea- farers.” The clause within the commas is not essential to the main thought, so it starts with which. In contrast, take this sentence: “We need to replace the light that failed, but the other lights serve us well.” That failed is an essential clause, hence that. The that clause is called a restrictive clause (or, in Britain, a defining clause ). No comma precedes it. The which clause is called a nonrestrictive clause (or, in Britain, a nondefining clause ). Commas set it apart. Sometimes the meaning of a sentence depends on the proper choice between the two pronouns. It makes a difference whether the boss tells his new employee ( 1 ) “Get the widget, which we always use for this type of work” or ( 2 ) “Get the widget that we always use for this type of work.” Just what the new employee is to get depends on a single pronoun. If we assume that the boss knows his gram- mar, the first sentence implies that he has only one widget; the second sentence im- plies that he has more than one widget and insists on a particular one and that the newcomer had better find out which one. Writers began consciously making the distinction between those two pronouns in the relatively recent past. In the book The King’s English, first published in 1906 , brothers H. W. and F. G. Fowler took a notable step toward increased clarity when they wrote: . . . That, when possible, is the appro- priate relative for defining and which for non-defining clauses. . . . It would contribute much to clearness of style if writers would always make up their minds whether they intend a defini- tion or a comment and would invari- ably use no commas with a defining clause and two commas with a non- that and which 423 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 423"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"defining. [But the call for an invari- able use of two commas was a mis- take. The “non-defining” clause, or nonrestrictive clause, may come at the end of a sentence and need only one comma to set it apart.] Practices in earlier centuries were chaotic. Literature suggests that some writers sensed differences between the two pronouns while others did not; of- ten which was forced to serve both func- tions. The principle enunciated by the Fowlers had a good deal of influence in both Britain and the United States. By no means was there rapid or even general conformity. Numerous writers contin- ued to favor a restrictive which. Empha- sis is added in this 1920 passage from a work by H. G. Wells (and in the exam- ples that follow): . . . These nine main language groups . . . are the latest languages, the sur- vivors, which have ousted their more primitive predecessors. There may have been other . . . ineffective centres of speech which were afterwards overrun by the speakers of still surviv- ing tongues, and of elementary lan- guages which faded out. We find strange little patches of speech still in the world which do not seem to be connected with any other language about them. The first which seems to be nonrestric- tive; the other three seem to be restrictive and, under the Fowler principle, replace- able by that. We cannot be positive of an author’s intent when he uses which in both ways; at least he should precede each nonrestrictive which with a comma. Wells apparently has done so. Seven pages later, the word appears four times in one sentence. The alternation of settlement, no- madic conquest, refinement, fresh conquest, refinement, which is charac- teristic of this phase of human history, is particularly to be noted in the re- gion of the Euphrates and Tigris, which lay open in every direction to great areas which are not arid enough to be complete deserts, but which were not fertile enough to support civ- ilized populations. The first which and the second seem to be nonrestrictive; the latter two seem to be restrictive. Again, a comma correctly precedes what appears to be each nonre- strictive use. Still, we cannot be positive of the meaning of which when it is used in both ways. Such usage persists to the current day among many writers, al- though many others do observe the dis- tinctions between that and which. 2. Indiscriminate WHICH; mix-up of THAT and WHICH Some writers who use “which” in re- strictive clauses at least set off nonre- strictive clauses with commas. Others seem totally baffled by the grammar and the punctuation and either (a) use “which” without the comma for both types of clause or (b) use “that” and “which” interchangeably. Trying to de- termine exactly what a writer intended can be an insoluble puzzle for a reader. There are writers who think that is more “colloquial” and which is more “liter- ary.” Nonsense. Each word has a clear function. In the following passage, a newspaper writer uses “which” restrictively in his first sentence; in his second, he correctly chooses which for a nonrestrictive clause but fails to precede it with a comma. . . . Increasing civil suit judgments against city, county and state govern- ments are being caused by several factors, including . . . a court rul- ing which allows governments to be sued. . . . 424 that and which 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 424"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"The legislature in 1976 passed the Tort Claims Act which allows citizens to sue the government. . . . In the first sentence, “which” should be that. In the second, a comma belongs af- ter “Act” to make it clear that what comes after the comma is explanatory and not an integral part of what comes before. A card listing postal rules contains two restrictive clauses using “which.” Both are wrongly separated from the main sentence by commas. Mail, which is properly addressed to a post office box or caller service num- ber, will be delivered through that post office box or caller service. . . . Any information on the application, which changes or becomes obsolete, must be corrected by promptly updat- ing the Form 1093 on file. . . . Not all mail will be delivered; not all in- formation must be corrected. Each “which” clause is essential to the main idea of the sentence. Thus all the com- mas should be deleted and each “which” should be that. The sample sentence that follows, from a book criticizing American educa- tion, contains both that and which with no comma, used in a roughly parallel way. The precise intent of the author is uncertain. But there is one dangerous new trend that threatens to wreak havoc upon our educational system—a new thrust which can kill America’s traditional enthusiasm for constantly improving the nation’s schools and colleges. . . . See also PREVENT. 3. “THAT” in place of WHICH “That” appears to be used nonrestric- tively, and therefore erroneously, in both of the following examples. Maximus is in the early stages of the program that, when it hits full stride, could be processing 100 , 000 recipi- ents [of welfare payments]. TV Guide is the nation’s largest selling weekly magazine, with a circulation of more than 17 million, that earned an estimated $ 75 million profit last year. In both of the examples, “that” appears to be used nonrestrictively. In the former example, “that” ought to be which and preceded by a comma. The clause “ which . . . could be processing 100 , 000 recipients” is a nonrestrictive clause; the information it adds could be tossed out without damage to the first part of the sentence. The article talks of only one program. If there were another program, “that” might properly be used restric- tively, distinguishing the program “ that could be processing 100 , 000 recipients” from another program. In the latter example too, “that” in- troduces a nonrestrictive clause, so it ought to be which. The clause “ which earned” etc. merely gives supplementary information. An exception to the restrictive -that principle is customarily made to avoid a double that, as in “That that I see I be- lieve.” Rather than follow that (demon- strative pronoun) with another that (relative pronoun), you can make the second word which: “That which I see. . . . ” But technically the double that is not wrong. 4. Versions of a famous phrase The final passage is out of the ordi- nary. A columnist erred by inadvertently improving the grammar of a historic per- sonage. (The emphasis is the columnist’s.) President Franklin D. Roosevelt did not say that Dec. 7 , 1941 , was “a day that and which 425 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 425"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"that will live in infamy.” He said it was “a date that will live in infamy.” Not exactly. The item was headed “You Could Look It Up.” It was a good idea. Three books of quotations did match the columnist’s version in toto. But three others gave “a date which will live in in- famy,” a quotation confirmed by reprints of the speech in three more books and, conclusively, by a sound recording of the speech. A booklet accompanying the recording was the least accurate: “Franklin D. Roosevelt declared it a ‘day that will live in in- famy’. . . . ” The popularity of the “that” version, which paradoxically is the more gram- matical, should at least hearten adher- ents to the Fowler principle. THAT, WHO, and WHICH. See WHO, THAT, and WHICH. THE. 1. Generalities. 2. Intrusion. 3. Omission. 4. Pronunciation. 1. Generalities The definite article, the, is the most common word in English. It usually in- troduces a particular thing or individual or group, one that was mentioned before or whose existence is known or pre- sumed to be known. ( See A and AN for a discussion of the indefinite article.) Typically, something or someone that is preceded by a or an when first men- tioned is later preceded by the (if not re- placed by a pronoun): “One of the people I met there was a professor from St. Louis . . . . The professor said. . . . ” The may precede a noun on first men- tion if the noun is specific and known. “ The country is behind him,” but “He was a man without a country.” / “ The hats [specific ones] look good on you,” but “Hats [in general] look good on you.” We may speak of “Thomas Edison, the inventor” because of his fame but “Joe Doaks, a store clerk.” In addition, idiom calls for the definite article in various expressions and con- structions. It must go in a superlative (“It’s the biggest”) but not often in a comparative (“This one is bigger”). “She is in the hospital.” (In England one is simply “in hospital.”) “I took the bus,” but “I went by bus.” / “They read the papers,” but “They read books.” / “ The evening is my favorite time of day,” but “Evenings are for relaxation.” A single the can serve for multiple nouns when the nouns pertain to one person or idea: “the lord and master” / “the vice president and general man- ager” / “the pain, pleasures, and satisfac- tions of life.” More than one person or idea gets a separate the: “the chairman and the president” / The Prince and the Pauper / “the star and the planet.” The may occasionally be repeated for empha- sis when not essential to the meaning: “Here she is: the one, the only ....” Besides serving as an article, the can be an adverb, used with a comparative adjective and meaning to that extent or by that. “The more the merrier.” / “They are none the wiser.” See also A and AN. 2. Intrusion A. Of THE Too many journalists have the habits of omitting the article the where it be- longs ( see 3 ) and sticking it in where no article belongs or where a or an would be more appropriate. In the following excerpts from three press stories, each intrusive “the” is em- phasized; it does not apply to anything that was mentioned before or that any reader would already know about.

Of noun; of editorial opinion A front-page story in a Nevada news- paper shows that ( 1 ) the intruder can be the noun that follows the and ( 2 ) the can intrude a point of view in a supposedly unbiased piece. Houston Police Chief Lee Brown . . . wants Bush to set up a national crime commission. The panel would exam- ine the root causes of crime and drug abuse—including urban joblessness and poor education. The first sentence mentions “a . . . com- mission.” The second mentions “the panel.” We can guess that they are the same, but why should we have to? If “a . . . commission” is correct, the sec- ond reference should be to The commis- sion or simply It. See also Pronouns, 6B; Synonymic silliness. The second “the” poses another prob- lem. It implies that “the” root causes of crime and drug abuse have been deter- mined and are commonly known. If that was the chief’s opinion, it should have been made clear. Otherwise a more ob- jective phrase than “the root causes” was needed; examples: alleged causes / some possible causes / social ills that some say cause. C. Of modifier Often the noun following the does not change but new information is sand- the 427 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 427"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"wiched between them. This passage is from a book of travel reminiscences: On the way we stopped to pick up a lone white figure walking along the road. . . . The tall, bearded figure got in the car. . . . Were there two figures? Probably not, inasmuch as the latter sentence is the first to introduce a “tall, bearded figure.” Therefore to precede the entire phrase with “The” is unwarranted. Normally the applies only to something that has been stated or is well known, not to new information. The only thing in common between “lone white figure” and “tall, bearded figure” is figure. Thus the sec- ond sentence can properly speak of The figure and the adjectives should be placed elsewhere; for instance: “The fig- ure, tall and bearded, got in the car. . . . ” (A comma after “lone” in the former sentence is desirable too.) These in essence are the first two sen- tences of a news story: ...A city-financed apartment building . . . will officially open to- morrow in Queens. The 14 -story building in Flushing includes a medical center, social ser- vices, emergency alarms . . . and closed-circuit television. . . . The opening sentence says nothing about a 14 -story building. It mentions only “a city-financed apartment build- ing.” The second sentence would be ti- dier by kicking out the “ 14 -story” intruder and uniting the natural couple, “The” and “building.” Among various possible rewordings: “The building has 14 stories and includes a medical center, social services. . . . ” (In the first sentence Flushing, Queens would help those un- familiar with the geography of New York City.) Another news story mentions “the ap- pointment of a commission of inquiry” in Israel. The next sentence says, “The three-man commission ruled yesterday that. . . . ” Readers can assume that just one commission is involved, but a neater story would put The together with com- mission. Either mention the three men in the first sentence or reword the second to put the modifying phrase elsewhere, e.g., “The commission, made up of three men, ruled yesterday that. . . . ” Still another news story mentions the governor of Louisiana by name and title in the lead sentence. Below, the article refers to “the one-time cotton farmer and Harvard Business School graduate” (with no identification), and later it quotes “the 45 -year-old conservative Democrat” (with no identification). Un- less different people are being described, connect those descriptive phrases to the governor (by name or title or both) and change each “the” to a. ( See also Modi- fiers, 2. ) There is more justification for a re- porter’s designations of Andrei Sakharov, a world-famed Russian, as “the physicist” (twice), “the physicist and human rights campaigner,” and “the longtime human rights campaigner.” (That last one may be on the borderline.) 3. Omission A peculiarity of more than a few jour- nalists when writing is to omit a word that they would not think of omitting when speaking: the definite article, the. They will not leave it out every time, only sometimes: at the beginning of a sentence, for instance. A newspaper col- umn tells of a parade in Massachusetts: Focus was dedication of the restored home of Katharine Lee Bates, the lady who wrote “America the Beautiful.” Would the columnist speak like that: “Focus was . . . ”? Certainly not. If he 428 the 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 428"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"used focus at all, he would precede it with the. He would probably even put another the before “dedication.” Notice that the sample sentence uses the three times. If it were consistent, it would say “dedication of restored home of Katharine Lee Bates, lady who wrote ‘America Beautiful.’ ” (Such a sentence is not recommended either, of course.) This is from a caption for a picture of a well-known bridge: Spanning San Francisco Bay, the land- mark was world’s longest until 1961 . The logic that permits one definite article (before “landmark”) but omits another, just as desirable (before “world’s”), is obscure. What accounts for those odd omis- sions? Is it rationing of definite articles by the newspapers; or is it an idiosyn- cratic newsroom rule of yore, perpetu- ated and varied by generations of journalists imitating the mannerisms of other journalists? A newspaper editor of mine forbade staff members to start any story with an article, definite or in- definite. “It’s weak,” he explained. If the writings gained anything, it was circuity, not strength. A newscaster said a kidnaping victim “made her escape and was able to call police.” A press service reported that a gunman’s victim “ran to nearby apart- ments to call police.” Observe that jour- nalists “call police.” Most others “call the police”; this is idiomatic when police is construed as singular (a department), which is commonly the case, rather than plural (policemen). 4. Pronunciation Before vowel sounds, the is usually pronounced THEE. Examples: the ap- ple, the ooze, the M-1. Before consonants, the is pronounced THUH, voiced, with almost no vowel: the car, the watermelon, the yellow. In a dialectal variation, some pronounce the that way before vowels as well. The is pronounced either way before the long e sound, as in the easel. THEE, THOU, and YE. See Pro- nouns, 10A. THEFT. See CRIME, MISDE- MEANOR, and FELONY; Crimes, 3. THEIR. See Homophones; Possessive problems, 4; Pronouns, 2. “THEIRSELF” or “THEIR- SELVES.” See Pronouns, 5. THEM and THEY. See Pronouns, 10; Pronouns’ classification. THEM and THOSE. Let the griz- zled prospector of story exclaim, “There’s gold in them hills!” Were his English corrected, it would not ring true. It behooves the rest of us to speak of those hills, those fruits, or those days. Those and them are pronouns (noun substitutes). Those is also an adjective (a modifier of a noun). Them is not. You can either “forgive those who sin” or “forgive them who sin” (or not forgive at all). But a radio host who said that many suicides in Iran “are due to them kind of laws” was dead wrong. “Those kind” would not be right either, combining a plural adjective and a sin- gular noun. Any of these work: those kinds of law or that kind of law or laws of that kind. See also KIND OF, 1; Pronouns, 2 (misuse of them ); THESE and THOSE. THEMSELVES and “THEM- SELF.” See Pronouns, 5.

Thermos is a trademark for a portable container that keeps liquid or food hot or cold by means of a partial vacuum between the outer and inner walls. A problem is exemplified by a statement in a theater review that “ac- tors balance thermoses in the sand” and by suggestions for take-out meals in a cookbook: Put one of the sauces . . . in a small, wide-mouthed thermos and use as a dip. . . . Put your favorite soup in a thermos. . . . Take [instant soup] in thermos. If it is a Thermos, it gets a capital T; if an imitation, it may be called a vacuum bot- tle, vacuum jar, or the like.

Both words refer to the thing or per- son mentioned or understood. Whether the thing or person is here or there deter- mines which word to choose. When re- ferring to something near, in space or time (or, sometimes, thought), use this; to something relatively far, use that. The words may be used in comparing two things, one close and the other more dis- tant: “Isn’t this melon bigger than that one?” See also THESE and THOSE. When something is about to be stated, this is suitable. (“This poem expresses my sentiment:” / “This above all: to thine ownself be true”). Often that is clearer in referring to what was already stated. (“Our review validates the current National Security Council Sys- tem. . . . That system is properly the president’s creature. . . . Having said that. . . . ”) For a few decades, this has tended to encroach upon the province of that. A modern book says, “This year Boswell went again to London, once more beset by the anxiety of departure.” Customar- ily this year refers to the year we are now in. The author is referring to 1773 , men- tioned six sentences back in the previous paragraph. “ That year” would have been preferable. At the same time, this has tended to usurp the functions of nouns and other pronouns, including it, he, and she, and its use has swelled. The excerpt that fol- lows is from a government memoran- dum. It uses this, the pronoun, in three consecutive sentences. Alternative sug- gestions are offered in brackets. (Empha- sis is added. In an omitted passage after the first sentence, the speaker praises Iran for its supposed cooperation. Our concern here is solely verbal.) “Regarding the commitment of the U.S. to turn a page, this [it?] is ex- pressed by my presence on behalf of the President . . . . This [That?] spirit, if it had been present in our first en- counter, would have made clear we could reach some agreement. Unfor- tunately, we have reached this point after a year and three efforts, where we thought we have an agreement. This [The delay, frustration?] has af- fected the President’s view of our abil- ity to reach an agreement . . . . This [It?] affected his faith in our ability to work together.” The next section contains several ad- ditional examples of the overuse of this, emphasizing the serious matter of com- prehension. 2. Vague THIS A companion to the excessive depen- dence on this is the absence of any clear antecedent. An antecedent is the noun that a pronoun represents. It is hazy or nonexistent in the excerpts to come. . . . Quayle is among 51 senators who signed a letter urging Mr. Shultz not to issue a visa for Mr. Arafat. This would make it even more diffi- cult for a Bush Administration to re- lax American conditions for dialogue with the P.L.O. . . . What is the antecedent of “this”? The letter? Something else? Something not explicitly mentioned, such as Mr. Shultz’s nonissuance of a visa? We must guess. I rejoice when European countries throw off tyranny through the will of the people, and I wonder whether this could have prevented the Nazi scourge. What is “this”? The will of the people? The will of the German people, had it been different? The collective will of Eu- this 431 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 431"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"ropean people to intervene during the thirties? A vague “this” is no replace- ment for adequate thought. In the book excerpt that follows, “this” appears three times in five sen- tences. The first time, the antecedent may be phenomenon. The second time, the pronoun it might have been a better choice. The third is more conjectural; re- placing “This” with a noun would have made the meaning clearer. (Emphases and parentheses are in the book. Brack- ets are added.) “And this occurs in the case of opaque surfaces”; the hues depend on the na- ture of the reflecting body. Here Leonardo deals with the point or sheet of light that is reflected on smooth and polished surface. This [It?] is one aspect of what is called riverberazione in Manuscript A. Prop- erly speaking, lustro is separate from reflection ( riflesso ) in which a specular image is produced. This [?] is impor- tant insofar as it involves the transfer of a neighboring color on the local tint of a given object. Initially, the last “This” seems to stand for “reflection,” the phenomenon men- tioned last. But the context suggests that lustro, or luster, is a better guess. A little later, the following passage appears. It was the moment of sfumato— of grace, of ambiguity—that for Leonardo tended more and more to become integrated in the finality of the painting. This [?] was all the more faithful to its vocation since it was ca- pable of impressing upon the con- science the strangeness of the real that it had to explore. “Ambiguity” (not “grace”) sums it up.

Thus, meaning accordingly, therefore, or in this (or that ) way, is an adverb. To append “-ly,” as these ex- tracts do, adds nothing to the meaning and an inane cuteness to the style. Democratic pollster Peter Hart yes- terday described the problems facing Dukakis and Jackson thusly: “We have one candidate who . . .” [etc.]. Salisbury’s reasoning—advanced in vivid detail in his book—goes thusly: The American Establishment, as it evolved . . . [etc.]. “Thusly” fits no serious discussion, if anything. It should have been stripped of its suffix and turned into thus, or re- placed by a synonym such as in this way or as follows. TILL and “’TIL.” A caption for a lo- cally televised news report (on damaged freeways) read “CLOSED ’TIL SPRING.” Soon after, an episode in a national television series was titled “’Til Death Do Us Part” (concerning the killing of husbands). Later a motion pic- ture titled ’Til There Was You came to theaters. Till, with two l ’s, is the word that was needed. It takes no apostrophe, because it is not a contraction. Meaning until, it is a bona fide word and may be used in all writing, formal and informal, al- though until is more common as the first word of a sentence. As a preposition, each means either up to the time of (“I worked till [or until ] midnight”) or, with 432 those and them 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 432"},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"a negative, before (“The game doesn’t start till [or until ] 8 ”). As a conjunction, each means up to the point that or up to the time of (“He stayed till [or until ] the job was done”). “Up till” or “up until” is redundant. There is a word til, with no apostro- phe, which comes from Hindi and de- notes the sesame plant, particularly as used in India, for food and oil. Other meanings of till are (noun) a money con- tainer, glacial drift, and (verb, transitive) to prepare land for farming. Time. See A.M., P.M.

Titles. 1. Imitation titles. 2. Social ti- tles. 3. Titles of office. 1. Imitation titles It is a journalistic peculiarity to stuff a description or job title in front of some- one’s name as though it were a formal ti- tle of respect. The beginning of this quotation will illustrate: Outgoing Deputy Chief of Staff for Public Affairs Selma ——— said in a news release Friday that [Governor] Carruthers was informed of her resig- nation and those of Mike ——— and Bruce ——— a week ago. Imagine calling up a governor’s staff as- sistant and asking, “Is this ‘Outgoing Deputy Chief of Staff for Public Affairs Smith?’ ” That mouthful (without the “Outgoing” and the name) might consti- tute her formal job title, but it is not a ti- tle that normally precedes a name, in the manner of a social title or a title of office. If it followed the name, it would be just as informative and not nearly so cum- bersome: “Selma ———, deputy chief of staff for public affairs.” (All those capi- tal letters are unnecessary. So is “Outgo- ing.” If the woman has submitted her resignation, of course she is going out.) To suspend a name pending a long de- scription is usually too awkward for broadcasting but habitual in the press. Some short, bona fide titles, such as Sen- ator, may precede names. (See 2 and 3.) And “the actress Jane Roe” and “a plumber, John Doe” are idiomatic forms. What smacks of journalese is “Actress Jane Roe” or “Plumber John Doe.” In its style book, The Associated Press condones “astronaut John Glenn, movie star John Wayne, peanut farmer Jimmy Carter.” It gets worse when a long job title is piled up in front of a name. Further ex- amples follow below. Perhaps the writers thought they were being terse. The first saves no words from the piling-up; each of the others saves two small words. (Smoother wordings are in parentheses.) “Supervisor of Correctional Educa- tion Bill Lane” (Bill Lane, supervisor of correctional education); “California En- ergy Commission Chairman Charles Im- brecht” (Charles Imbrecht, chairman of the California Energy Commission); “Youth Guidance Center chief probation officer Fred Jordan” (Fred Jordan, chief probation officer of the Youth Guidance Center); and “former deputy staff chief and now Transportation Secretary An- drew Card” (Andrew Card, former deputy chief of staff and now secretary of transportation). Note that there is no “staff chief” or “Transportation Secre- tary”; the terms are chief of staff and sec- retary of transportation. The practice is not new. A monstrous specimen was attributed to a dispatch re- ceived in a newspaper office from a wire service, probably in 1939 : titles 433 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 433"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"VICE-PRESIDENT-IN-CHARGE- OF-EVAPORATED-CONDENSED- AND MALTED MILK-CHEESE- MINCE MEAT-AND-CARAMELS ARTHUR W.

The habit extends to fictional people and includes the creating of descriptions. A movie review said, “Carrey plays slick Los Angeles lawyer Fletcher Reede.” A more natural phrasing might be “Carrey plays a slick lawyer of Los Angeles, Fletcher Reede.” The idea, or at least popularizing, of imitation titles has been ascribed to Time in its early years. The magazine still dis- plays phrases like “Asian-American fund raiser John Huang” and “GOP virtue- crat William Bennett.” (The latter used to be called “drug czar William Ben- nett.”) Even figures from the past may get such treatment in the press. A caption re- called the appointment of “Presbyterian elder and Warren G. Harding campaign manager Will Hays” in 1922 as presi- dent of an organization to protect Holly- wood’s reputation. Fortunately, historical authors are not ready to write of “Italian Navigator and Discoverer of the New World Christo- pher Columbus,” or of “Commander of the Continental Army in the American Revolution and Father of His Country George Washington.” See also Modifiers, 4. 2. Social titles During the Reagan administration a newspaper item said: Reagan will address the grandpar- ent-volunteer group at . . . Epcot Cen- ter [on a drug topic]. . . . Reagan plans to return to Washington on Wednesday afternoon. To most Americans, the subject of each sentence could be only one person, Presi- dent Ronald Reagan. It was not. The story was about Nancy Reagan. Nobody meeting her would address her as “Reagan.” She would be “Mrs. Reagan” even to her worst enemy. But the particular newspaper had a style rule that everyone must be called by his or her last name on the second reference, with no title. So the staff followed it, re- gardless of the resulting absurdity. Two administrations later, a contro- versy arose over a newspaper’s publica- tion of private comments by Hillary Clinton. An article about the matter ap- peared in a magazine (for the newspaper industry). The first sentence apparently suggests that President Clinton had stuck up for his wife: Clinton was said to be furious her remarks were publicized. . . . This was the second time Clinton dined with women feature writers at the White House. . . . One man who was once asked to the White House for a tête-à-tête with Clinton is . . . [etc.]. The person repeatedly called “Clinton” was not President William J. Clinton but Mrs. Clinton. The practice of omitting the social titles of women had become widespread, and the magazine was fol- lowing it too. It can be confusing, as we see. It does not reflect the norm of civil behavior— would you call her “Clinton”?—though the press professes to mirror society. And it can be considered degrading to deprive women of their titles. To deprive men of their “Mr.” has long been commonplace among American newspapers. Even children get the icy, surname- 434 titles 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 434"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"only treatment. A story about a malprac- tice suit said: Hospital staff failed to electroni- cally monitor Chan’s fetal heart tone . . . [while] her mother was in la- bor. . . . As a result, Chan suffers from cerebral edema and seizures [etc.]. Who, outside the press, would refer to a fetus and a girl of five that way? Some publications grant social titles only to the subjects of obituaries. Others will not have them even then. This is typ- ical of more than one daily: “Howard died June 10 , days before her 80 th birth- day.” Broadcasting has picked up that rude style. An anchor woman repeatedly referred to the late actress Audrey Mead- ows as “Meadows.” Though called “ Miss Meadows” in life, in death she was not afforded the respect of a title. The Associated Press (AP) will not re- fer to a man as Mr. unless it is combined with Mrs., as in Mr. and Mrs. John Smith. AP does use social titles (it calls them courtesy titles) for women. It prefers a woman’s own full name and no title on the first reference: Mary Smith; on the second reference, the form is Mrs. or Miss or—if she prefers —Ms. Smith or just Smith. Allowing both sexes social titles is get- ting rare in the press. In second and later references, The New York Times will usually put Mr., or another bona fide ti- tle, before a man’s surname. Its general policy has long been to use the full name and no social title for a woman on the first reference in a news story, thereafter to use the title Miss or Mrs. with the sur- name. In 1986 , the newspaper amended its policy: It would use Ms. when the woman preferred it or when her marital status was not known. Earlier, Ms. “had not passed sufficiently into the language to be accepted as common usage. The Times now believes that ‘Ms.’ has be- come a part of the language. . . . ” In practice, it seems to be the paper’s female title of first resort. Ms. may be traced at least to the 1950 s. A leaflet on letter writing by an association of office managers suggested its use to solve a problem: how to ad- dress women of uncertain marital status. And a manual for secretaries recom- mended: “If in doubt about ‘Miss’ or ‘Mrs,’ use ‘Miss’ or ‘Ms’ (meaning either ‘Miss’ or ‘Mrs.’).” Promoted by feminists and assigned the pronunciation MIZ, Ms. became common in the seventies. The traditional Miss and Mrs. were said to be discrimi- natory—although polls suggested that most women favored them and disliked Ms. For instance, betrothed maidens ob- jected to the society pages’ raising doubt about their marital status. Business has accepted Ms. An execu- tive says, “I myself find it very useful, of- ten having occasion to address letters to women whose marital status is unknown to me and not easily discovered.” News people have cause to like it, just as they like leaving out titles altogether. By using “Ms. Smith,” they need not take the trouble to find out if a woman is Miss Smith or Mrs. Smith. And if they can say just “Smith,” they may not even have to find out if a person is a woman or a man. (Some first names, including Dale, Lee, Leslie, Marion, Robin, and Toby, are of dual gender, and foreign names may be puzzling.) Mr. and Mrs. are abbreviations of mis- ter and mistress, which for centuries has usually been pronounced MISS-iz when referring to a married woman. Unlike them, Ms. is an artificial entity that repre- sents no single word and has no plural. ( See Plurals and singulars, 2H. ) Nor does it have a distinctive pronunciation; it bor- rows from musty, regional dialect, in which Mrs. is pronounced MIZ. At least one clerk of a law court, announcing names of jury panelists, regularly pro- nounced it “EM ESS,” like the abbrevia- titles 435 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 435"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"tion of master of science, multiple sclero- sis, millisecond, manuscript, missile sys- tem, or Mississippi in postal code. Miss is still used, with a surname, in addressing or referring to a girl; or a woman who has not married; or a woman by her professional name, even if she is married and has a different per- sonal name. (In a news story, Elizabeth Taylor was called just “Taylor” twice and then, in a flash of civility, “Miss Tay- lor.”) Miss or madam is used without a surname to address a female stranger. (“Miss, you dropped your purse.”) Traditional etiquette decrees that when Mrs. precedes a full name, it shall not be the woman’s own name (“Mrs. Agnes Cooper”) but her husband’s (“Mrs. John Cooper”). To say “I am Mr. Doaks,” instead of “I am Joseph Doaks,” is considered im- modest, unless one is addressing schoolchildren. And this is a matter of word usage rather than etiquette, but it is not correct to say “His name is Mr. Edwards”; rather, “ He is Mr. Edwards” and “His name is George L. Edwards.” See also REVEREND. Mr. and Mrs. with a name are always abbreviated. It is never “Mister Doaks.” But they are never abbreviated when used as words: “Hey, mister, do you have a match?” / “I have to call the mis- sis” (or “missus”). Publications that use social titles have exceptions. The Times omits them from sports stories and from references to fa- mous people who are no longer living. An eastern newspaper that I worked for excluded Mr. from the names of arrested men. When I asked why, the city editor replied, “Any son of a bitch that gets himself arrested doesn’t deserve to be called mister.” 3. Titles of office Some job titles may precede names, and they are short: President, Governor, Senator, Representative ( or Rep. for short ), General, Colonel, Dean, Profes- sor, etc. A title that precedes a name be- gins with a capital. That goes only for an official title, not a pseudo title like “Drug Czar” or “Rock ’n’ Roll King” or “Cherry Blossom Queen.” (For citizens of a republic, we seem remarkably fond of royal appellations.) Dr. is another title that may precede a name, when the doctorate is earned and not just honorary. It is superfluous when the degree follows a name. Frank A. Robinson, M.D., or George B. Sanders, Ph.D., is enough. No other title should precede Dr. “Su- perintendent of Schools Dr. Ambrose Walker” goes too far. Better: Dr. Am- brose Walker, superintendent of schools. Nor should any other pair of titles be combined, as in “County Supervisor Mrs. Frederick J. Van Buren.” The office can go after the name. An official position or office men- tioned in a general sense does not merit an initial capital: “He has decided to run for governor.” When the word identifies a particular holder of the office, it may reasonably be capitalized: “The Gover- nor has signed. . . . ” Another reasonable style is that of The Associated Press. It calls for all titles to be in lower case when not affixed to a name: “The pope gave his blessing” but “Pope John Paul gave. . . . ” An article, attributed to AP, was inconsistent: ...He. . . became the first Virginia mayor to lose his seat in an election on recalling him from office. . . . The City Council can pick a member to serve as Mayor, go outside . . . for a Mayor, or do nothing. In each instance, mayor is used in a gen- eral sense; it does not refer to a particu- lar person, so no capital M is warranted. An official title of modest length is customarily capitalized before the name: “Attorney General Janet Reno said. . . . ” But it needs no capitals after the name: “Janet Reno, the attorney gen- eral, said. . . .” Sometimes a lawyer in no 436 titles 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 436"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"official position is called, for instance, “Attorney Roger U. Nelson.” There is no title of “attorney,” hence no com- pelling reason to put it in front of a name, particularly with a capital A. ( See also ATTORNEY and LAWYER. ) When the name of a person is intro- duced in any writing or talk, an identify- ing title or description normally is necessary, unless the person is famous enough to need none—Jefferson and Lincoln come to mind. A book about travels in Africa tells an anecdote in which “Bokassa” is mentioned three times with no title. The fourth time, he is “Emperor Bokassa” (the ruler of the Central African “Empire”—now Repub- lic—until 1979 ). The first mention would be a better place for the title, in case the name of that tyrant is unfamiliar to any reader. In a long piece with a sizable cast of characters, one identification per person may not be enough. Reading “O’Brien said . . . ,” readers may strain to remem- ber him if he was identified twenty para- graphs back and other names have since been introduced. Let memories be refreshed: “Dr. O’Brien, the director, said. . . . ” Then no one need search, guess, or give up. Once a person has left a public office in which he held a prominent title, such as President, Senator, Judge, or Ambas- sador, continuing to attach that title to his name is no longer necessary, if it makes any sense at all. Yet there is an American tradition of doing just that. People will persist in addressing a one- time Senator Scott that way, even though he has legally been Mr. Scott for many years. The Honorable honorific has stay- ing power too. See HONORABLE (etc.). For titles of books, etc., see Capital- ization; Italics; Punctuation, 10. TO. 1. Missing. 2. Overworked. 1. Missing In light of the many functions of to, its appearance more than once in a sentence should disconcert nobody. Yet some- times a single to is left to handle a double load. A notice offering a reward for infor- mation about the perpetrators of a crime said: IN CASE OF A DUPLICATION OF INFORMATION OR DISPUTE, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS . . . WILL BE THE SOLE JUDGE AS TO WHOM THE REWARD SHALL BE PAID OR AS TO THE MANNER IN WHICH THE REWARD MAY BE DIVIDED. The first “TO” is part of the phrase “AS TO.” But the writer evidently expected the same “TO” to perform double duty in the phrase “TO WHOM,” something it could not do. Another TO could be slipped in next to the first one, but “AS TO TO WHOM” looks strange. A better way is to follow “SHALL BE PAID” with the additional TO. A further improvement is to replace each “AS TO” with a sharper preposition: “. . . THE SOLE JUDGE OF WHOM THE REWARD SHALL BE PAID TO OR OF THE MANNER IN WHICH THE REWARD MAY BE DIVIDED.” In another statement, “as to” and “to which” get only one to between them: As to which additional commodities the guaranteed price should be ap- plied, Mr. Gaitskell said. . . . “. . . Applied to. . . . ” See also Prepositions, 4. 2. Overworked Each of two dictionaries enumerates twenty-seven meanings of to, mostly as a preposition. A frequent function is to indicate the infinitive of verbs (to go, to eat). In that capacity to has no meaning itself and does not fulfill the normal function of a preposition, though classified as one. to 437 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 437"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"To can also indicate accompaniment (“dance to the music”), addition (“adding insult to injury”), agreement (“to my liking”), benefit (“It goes to a good cause”), contact (“a blow to the jaw”), direction (“I’m going to town”), extent or result (“It’s burned to ashes”), limit (“We stayed to the end”), posses- sion (“It belongs to us”), purpose (“I work to support my family), ratio (“The odds are two to one”), and many other things. To occasionally is an adverb meaning toward something implied or under- stood (“They kept the ship to” [the wind]) or to a point of contact (“She soon came to” [consciousness]). This two-letter word is overworked as it is. It ought not to be loaded with still more tasks: “The best present for the person on your list who has everything is . . . a gift membership to the . . . Insti- tute.” In that sentence, from a newslet- ter, the idiomatic preposition would be in. The star of a situation comedy was di- rected to say, “One night I came home to find my ex-husband having sex with three hookers in my lingerie.” Perhaps nobody in the audience would seriously remark, “There must be a better reason to go home,” but that construction does mimic to used in the sense of purpose. Better: “I came home and found. . . . ” Similarly: “ABC put two of its better dramas . . . on Saturday nights only to see them squashed” and “Students . . . demonstrated in support of the protest- ing workers, only to feel let down when the strikes did not spread. . . . ” Probably few if anyone would take such sentences literally and think that the network or the students showed masochistic ten- dencies; nevertheless “only to” is a pecu- liar form. The same points would be made concisely with “ and saw them squashed” and “ and felt let down. . . . ” An established use of to is to indicate a compulsion to perform an action: “You are to report for work tomorrow morning at 8 .” Headline writers have converted that to a simple future: “State to appeal judge’s ruling,” meaning that the state will appeal. Except in headlines, a construction like “The rainy season is to begin soon” is no substitute for the simple future: “ will begin soon.” To has so many meanings that it can easily be misinterpreted when used care- lessly, conveying a distorted message. For instance: “George Fox . . . defied Oliver Cromwell to found the Society of Friends in the seventeenth century.” A reader who thinks “to found” serves there as an infinitive can interpret the sentence as saying that Fox dared Cromwell to found the society—which is historically wrong. Either by founding or in order to found would eliminate the ambiguity. Although several critics con- demn the phrase in order to as a usually excessive replacement for to alone, it need not be avoided when, occasionally, it makes the meaning clear.

Used in the first sense, too should not start a sentence, but then too may. To o has several colloquial uses. Some- times it is merely an intensive, used in contradicting someone. “He is too the best player.” So could be used instead.

Such use is sometimes unnecessary, illogical, or, worse yet, ambiguous. A book says that ( 1 ) “Not too much light can be shed” on the origin of cer- tain words and ( 2 ) “Addison wasn’t too appreciative of” word games. A new- comer to colloquial English might be puzzled. Why would we want “too much” light instead of just enough light? And why should Addison have been “too appreciative” as long as he was ap- preciative enough? The contexts indicate that the “too” is unnecessary in each case. In the first sentence, “Not much light . . .” would have communicated the message. The second sentence might be justified as a touch of irony, although “Addison did not appreciate . . .” would be more straightforward. In those excerpts, “too” is just an il- logical colloquialism. It can be down- right ambiguous: “Your dress is not too good for the party.” Literally someone is being told that she is not overdressed. According to the colloquial sense, how- ever, she can get the message that she is wrongly dressed. Another example of ambiguity: “I can’t regard this book too highly.” The speaker may consider the book to be the ultimate in brilliance or not good enough to merit much regard. With some modifiers —all too, but too, and only too— it can mean regret- tably or unfortunately. “The rumors are all too true.” / “They’re only too eager to take your money.” In modern use, only too is often a mere intensive, equiv- alent to very (a use deplored by Sir Ernest Gowers). “We’re only too pleased to be of service.” To o can be part of a hyphenated ad- jective, such as “a too-familiar com- plaint” or “the too-trusting visitor.” See also NONE, 2. 2.

The adjectives tortuous and torturous share a Latin root and are often con- fused, yet they have different meanings in English. Torturous, as it suggests, pertains to torture or great pain (“a torturous inqui- sition”). It is pronounced TORE-chur- us. Tortuous means twisting, not straight- forward, or very complex (“the tortuous trails”). It is pronounced TORE-chew- us. A lawyer said his client’s plea of guilty to an assault charge was made under a “very torturous set of circumstances.” He probably meant tortuous. Webster’s Third Dictionary gives tor- tuous as one of the meanings of tortur- ous, thereby encouraging the confusion. Both adjectives, and the related ad- verbs tortuously and torturously, trace to the Latin torquere, to twist. So do the verbs torture and torment, the noun tort (injury in a legal sense), and the adjective tortuous and torturous 439 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 439"},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"tortious (TORE-shus, pertaining to a tort). TO SAY NOTHING OF. Discuss- ing lexicographical tradition, two au- thors write: Inevitably, Webster and Richardson, to say nothing of Webster and Wor- cester, disliked one another. If the authors intended to say nothing of Webster and Worcester, why did they say anything of them? “To say nothing of” is one of several peculiarly contradictory expressions and words. See NOT TO MENTION; Ver- bal unmentionables. See also INEVITABLE. TOTAL. 1. “A TOTAL OF.” 2. Singu- lar vs. plural verb. 1. “A TOTAL OF” In an enumeration such as “two owls and a hen, four larks and a wren—a to- tal of eight birds,” a total of is a useful phrase; it denotes a sum of the items. The phrase “a total of” frequently starts sentences like these in the press: A total of 60 police and protesters were injured in the scuffles. . . . A total of 402 Iowans who said they would definitely or probably attend the state’s precinct cau- cuses . . . were interviewed. . . . A total of 143 nations . . . joined in approving two resolutions challeng- ing the closing of the observer mis- sion. . . . What is the need for “a total of” when only one figure is mentioned? Obviously someone has counted the injured people, the Iowans, or the nations and come up with a total. The usual purpose is to get around a journalistic and literary taboo on start- ing a sentence with a figure. “ 143 na- tions,” or the like, is never supposed to be written. When, as a young reporter, I asked an editor why, he said only, “It would look strange.” Maybe so at first, because the rule has precluded initial fig- ures, at least in texts. Headlines may start with figures. Even if we accept the rule, “A total of” is usually a superfluous beginning. “Sixty police” is easy to write and read. “One hundred two Iowans” is not too hard. “One hundred forty-three na- tions” is just a little harder. An article contained the pair of sen- tences below. The latter is particularly awkward. A total of 167 delegates will be se- lected from the state’s 34 assembly districts. . . . A total of 2 , 081 of the 4 , 161 delegates will be needed to win the nomination. Is the 4,161 not the total? Better: “Of the 4 , 161 delegates, 2 , 081 will be needed. . . . ” See also Numbers, 11. 2. Singular vs. plural verb A subject starting with “ the total of” ordinarily takes a singular verb. “ The to- tal of 1 . 7 million votes was the highest ever recorded in the state.” But a subject starting with “ a total of” often takes a plural verb. “ A total of 1 . 7 million votes were cast in the state.” The first example emphasizes the total as a statistic. The second emphasizes the votes that were cast. Some writers fix on total and make every verb singular, however unid- iomatic: votes “was” cast. See also Collective nouns, 2. TO, TOO, and TWO.

A trademark, also spelled trade-mark, is a distinctive name, design, picture, symbol, or other device on goods offered for sale. It distinguishes the goods of a particular manufacturer or seller from similar goods produced or sold by others. Technically, a brand name, such as Pepsi-Cola or Sunkist, is a trademark; while a distinctive name of a business such as Kmart Stores or Bank of Amer- ica, is a trade name (usually two words). Often, especially in popular usage, trade name is applied to the product too. Registration of either at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or a corre- sponding state office is not essential, but it affords legal protection in case of in- fringement. In preventing unauthorized use of a mark or name, the law not only protects ownership but also helps to pro- tect the public from deception. The name of a product that is a trade- mark should always begin with a capital letter. It is accurate usage; besides, it helps keep the name from going into the public domain, losing its precise mean- ing, and penalizing the owner for its suc- cess. Aspirin, escalator, and yo-yo are among former trademarks. Manufacturers advertise and take other steps to encourage capitalization of such trademarks as the Coca-Cola nickname Coke, which contrasts with coke, a coal product and slang for co- caine. After Webster’s Third Dictionary came out, G. & C. Merriam Co. had to revise some 300 entries when owners of trademarks like Kleenex and Frigidaire threatened suit over the lack of initial capitals. Every product has a generic name— soda pop, facial tissues, refrigerators, and so on—that can be used in lieu of a brand name. Some publications take pains to avoid mentioning the commer- cial names of products except in adver- tisements. “But if a trade name [trademark] is pertinent to a story, use it,” The New York Times tells staff members. Its example: “The robbers es- caped in a white Cadillac sedan.” See also BAND-AID; JELL-O; KO- DAK; SEEING EYE; THERMOS; VASELINE; XEROX. TRADITION. See HONORABLE, HONORARY, HONORED. TRAGEDY. Tragedy signifies a seri- ous play with a very sad ending, or a play of that sort as a genre. It is a drama depicting a character’s struggle with an overpowering adversary through a series of solemn, pathetic, or shocking events, ending in calamity. Typically the protag- onist’s passion or character flaw leads to his undoing. When it does not pertain to drama, tragedy (noun) suggests an event or se- ries of events characterized by or ending in calamity or great suffering and usually death. Tragic (adjective) means pertain- ing to or having the character of either a dramatic tragedy or a general tragedy; it can mean calamitous or disastrous. Tragedy or tragic is frivolously in- voked at times to describe a state of af- fairs that is merely disagreeable or undesirable but involves no calamity or great suffering. A book speculates on the tragedy 441 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 441"},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"loss to English literature if Joyce, Shaw, Swift, and other literary masters of Ire- land had written in Gaelic: Their works would be as little known to us as those of the poets of Iceland or Norway, and that would be a tragedy indeed. That might be unfortunate (if “that” refers to unfamiliarity with the works of the Irishmen), but why would it be a “tragedy”? How would our ignorance of a literature cause us—much less the readers of that literature—calamity or great suffering? (The analogy is imper- fect. The Irish literati included non- poets; and our ignorance of Norwegian does not preclude our familiarity with the dramas of Ibsen. An Icelander and three Norwegians, including the poet Bjørnson, won the Nobel Prize for litera- ture.) In another book, the absence of a tragedy is perversely labeled a “tragedy.” For a man with Theodore Roosevelt’s need for personal fulfillment, it was a sort of tragedy that he had no war— not even a Whiskey Rebellion. The author seems to imply that war, with its killing and suffering, is of no moment if it brings a president “per- sonal fulfillment.” See also DISASTER. Transitive and intransitive verbs. See Verbs, 1. TRANSPIRE. To use “transpire” in- stead of happen or occur or take place is loose and pompous. The pomposity of “transpired” clashes with the informal styles of the movie review and book that are quoted here. See if anything would be lost by replacing “transpired” with, say, happened.

He said to you, ‘Thank you,’ but now, several days pass, nothing has changed.” This was precisely what had tran- spired. The loose use tends to devaluate a valuable word. To transpire (verb, tran- sitive or intransitive) is literally to give off vapor, moisture, odor, etc. through a body, plant, or other surface. Used figu- ratively about information, to transpire (verb, intransitive) is to leak out, to be- come known, or to come to light. For ex- ample, “The committee made its decision three months ago, but the facts did not transpire until yesterday.” No other single word expresses that mean- ing. TRAVESTY. A travesty is a type of burlesque or satire. It is a piece of litera- ture or drama that ( 1 ) ridicules its genre or ( 2 ) treats a serious work or lofty theme absurdly, grotesquely, or ironi- cally. Travesty is used figuratively, usually with justice, to suggest a grotesque or distorted imitation. The phrase “travesty of justice,” describing an unfair law or legal decision, has become a cliché since Edith Wharton used it in 1923 in A Son at the Front: “. . . It’s an iniquitous law, a travesty of justice” (that permits France to conscript an American). If a figurative meaning is intended, “travesty” alone is apt to make no sense: A newspaper article reported that Israeli leaders opposed blanket compensation for Palestinians claiming damages from 442 transitive and intransitive verbs 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 442"},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"Israeli army actions during the intifada, or uprising.

You can no more “commit” a travesty than you can “commit” a comedy or a satire. An article in another paper dealt with a school board’s approval of educational materials on the Sino-Japanese conflict. However, some who worked on the original curriculum proposal say that the administrators’ revision of the ma- terials omits the context and images necessary to convey the travesty’s im- pact. Was it a mistyping of tragedy or a dis- play of ignorance? To call the killing of millions a “travesty” is bizarre. Travesty entered England in 1648 , as a French verb, in the title of Le Virgile Travesty en Vers Burlesque, Virgil traves- tied in burlesque verses, by Paul Scarron. Meaning to disguise, travestir was an adaptation of the Italian travestire, from the Latin trans-, across, and vestire, to clothe. TREAD. The past tense of tread (verb, transitive and intransitive) is trod. “We took our packs and trod the path for three hours.” To use trod in a present sense is an error. Webster’s Third Dictio- nary tends to sanction the error, uncriti- cally quoting, “The eccentric is forced to trod a lonely way.” Make it tread. The past participle is trodden or trod. “The boy has trodden [or “trod”] this road often.” The other forms are regu- lar: treading, treads. In archaic times the past tense was trode. Among the meanings of tread are to walk, step, or dance on or along; to trample; to oppress; and to pump the feet (in water). TREASON. See Crimes, 5. TREMBLER and TEMBLOR. See TEMBLOR and TREMBLER. TRILLION. See BILLION. TRIO. A trio is a group of three singers or musicians, or a musical com- position for three voices or instruments. In a more general sense, a trio can be a group of three people who are connected in some joint action or at least closely as- sociated. The Three Stooges might qual- ify, but not three strangers who happen to be in an elevator at the same time. It is a journalistic cliché to use the word for any three people. An article concerning the Salvadorian civil war says, “The trio was cooking spaghetti and beans when a knock at the door came at 10 : 45 p.m.” The three people were not three musicians or three cooks at a restaurant but a woman and two friends of hers who came, sepa- rately, seeking refuge. To call them a “trio” stretches the word thin. Better: “The three were cooking. . . . ” Having linked them into a unit (“The trio was cooking”), the writer evades the gram- matical snare (“when it heard a knock”) and never again mentions the group in the remaining thirteen paragraphs. TRIUMPHAL and TRIUM- PHANT. The difference between these adjectives is subtle. Triumphant means victorious, also elated over victory. “The army is triumphant.” / “Their tri- umphant feeling was short-lived.” Using the word to mean triumphal is obsolete. Triumphal goes with something com- memorating or honoring a triumph: “We walked under the Triumphal triumphal and triumphant 443 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 443"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"Arch.” / “The band played Verdi’s Tri- umphal March.” Webster’s Third Dic- tionary promotes confusion of the two words by giving “TRIUMPHANT” as a meaning of triumphal. The related adverbs are triumphantly and triumphally. Triumph (noun) is vic- tory, conquest, or distinguished achieve- ment. To triumph (verb, intransitive) is to be victorious. TROOPER and TROUPER. See Homophones. TROOP, TROOPS, and TROUPE. Paraphrasing a bill in the U.S. Senate, a television panelist said it would put the president on notice that “you’re going to require prior congressional approval be- fore you send one troop into Haiti.” “One troop” sounded odd. The speaker may have meant one serviceman or one soldier. The singular, troop, de- notes a unit of Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts and, sometimes, a nondescript group of people or animals. In the military sense, a troop technically is a subdivision of a cavalry regiment; otherwise the plural, troops, is nearly always used, meaning armed forces collectively or any body of soldiers prepared to fight: “Troops have been shipped to Haiti.” A number may precede troops when the idea is to refer, impersonally, to a group; but not when the idea is to refer to individuals. Thus, “They have some 300 troops at the border” but not “The five troops described their experiences.” Troop is not to be confused with troupe, pronounced the same, meaning a group of entertainers. “TRUE” or “FALSE” FACTS.

A televi- sion panelist said of a presidential candi- date, “He wants to try and get out as many Republicans as he can.” Was “try and” correct or should it have been try to? It passed muster. The consensus of au- thorities is that try and is a colloquial id- iom that need not be avoided when it seems natural in speech, although some find it too casual for careful writing or even for the heights of oral eloquence. None impugn the good standing of try to. The two phrases are not identical in meaning. “Let’s try to stop them” and “Try to remember where you put the keys” literally call for attempts. On the other hand, “Try and stop me” is not a literal instruction but an expression of determination, and “Let’s try and win” offers encouragement. “We will try to reach our goal next month” implies res- olution, while “We’ll try and repair it soon” implies “Don’t count on it.” TUMMY.

Some twins, like flotsam and jetsam, jot or tittle, and spick and span, are in- separable. Anyone using an isolated alack, betwixt, fro, or main (noun) is not likely to be understood nowadays but might have been in past eras. One of the words may provide an ad- ditional shade of meaning or it may be just an empty synonym in legal style. Cranny does supplement nook, as kith does kin.

Noun: followed by OF As a noun, type usually means either (a) a category or class or (b) a person, creature, or thing with the features of the category or class. “What type of animal is it?” / “A baboon is a type of monkey.” / “The guiro is an instrument of the per- cussion type.” When type is followed by the name of the category or class, of should inter- vene.

The noun type can also denote printed characters (“The manuscript has been set up in type”) or the metallic blocks producing them in traditional printing. Type can serve as an adjective when it pertains to printing, as in type style and type faces, or when it is united with a technical term, as in Type AB blood.

This noun, along with the adjective ultimate, stems from the Medieval Latin ultimatus, meaning final. An ultimatum is the ultimate demand or proposition or statement of terms pre- sented by the government of one coun- try to the government of another country before launching war or using force. The threat of hostilities is ex- pressed or implied in the statement. Ulti- matum is too important a word to be treated in the casual way it often is. “Iran issued an ultimatum to Britain,” a newscaster announced on television. Iran’s demand, that Britain ban a book, was backed by the threat of severed relations but not hostilities. Therefore calling it an “ultimatum” is not a precise use of the word. At least the demand had an element of finality. Not so in the next instance, reported in a newspaper article: When city officials discovered that [an unauthorized street clock] last month, they issued an ultimatum to the restaurant’s owners. If you want permission to erect the clock . . . you must first remove it. There “ultimatum” is evidently sup- posed to be humorous, so its irrelevance to international relations does not alone preclude its use. However, the officials’ proposition carried no threat of forceful action and was not final. The next sen- tence says, “But discussions that began last week produced a less severe solution yesterday.” So no “ultimatum” was is- sued, even stretching the word to the bursting point. The South Korean government issued a statement asking the United States to clarify news reports of official spying on the Korean president. A story about the statement starts out with a contradic- tion: “The State Department yesterday rejected another South Korean ultima- tum, the second in two days.” Aside from the Koreans’ obvious reluctance to wage war on the United States, the fact is that they made two successive de- mands, so the first cannot be truly recorded as an “ultimatum.” A front-page headline: “Vatican Is- sues an Ultimatum. . . . ” According to the story, the Vatican’s envoy to Panama “delivered an ultimatum” to General Manual Noriega, the Panamanian leader, during the U.S. invasion: His sanctuary at the embassy would expire. What the envoy delivered was more like an eviction notice. The idea of the small- est state in the world threatening mili- tary violence is ludicrous. UNDESCRIBABLE.

UNIQUE. “It is absolutely the most unique place in the world,” a secretary of the interior said about the Grand Canyon. A scientist said about mam- moths, “They were very unique ani- mals.” An orchestral manager was quoted as saying, “Ojai is something so unique among festivals.” Unique (adjective), from the Latin unicus, only or single, means being the only one of its kind or without an equal. The Sun, as a star, is unique in the solar system but not in the universe. To call something or someone “the most unique” is as meaningless as calling it “the most only one.” Uniqueness can- not vary in degree. So adverbial quali- fiers like “most” / “very” / “so” / “rather” / “more” / “somewhat” cannot apply to unique. Some of them may ap- ply to weaker adjectives such as excep- tional, extraordinary, outstanding, rare, remarkable, or unusual. A very rare bird has a few specimens; only the final speci- men will be unique. It is possible to qual- ify unique with adverbs like truly, really, nearly, most nearly, or more nearly, which do not purport to change the de- gree of unique. But the speakers quoted above are not in the word business. Those in the mass media should know better, should they not? On television a newscaster said, “The budget bill was rather unique,” and an announcer described “America’s most unique travel adventures.” A magazine said that “the most unique mail order items” were not the most expensive. And the word appeared twice in a news story about a tribute to a baseball player: [Jackie Robinson] lived a career so compelling and unique its retelling once again riveted. . . . The obvious presence of such people of color un- derscored the unique relationship baseball has had with minorities since 1947 . . . . Robinson’s career was unique —not “so” unique, though so unusual, so extraordi- nary, etc. would be correct. The second sentence is grammatically sound, though the aptness of “unique” may be debated. Minorities are in other sports. Journal- ism need not ape the advertising indus- try, which tries to persuade us that every product is “unique.” (Another error in the first sentence is the intransitive use of “riveted.” Rivet is a transitive verb: “its retelling riveted the audience. ” See also RACE and NATIONALITY, 3. ) Surely an educator should be expected to know the proper usage of words. A high school supervisor in the Southeast told a television interviewer that not ev- eryone was capable of teaching. “It takes a very unique individual. . . . ” (One who speaks properly?) UNLESS AND UNTIL. The phrase “unless and until” befits a legal docu- ment. Separately, unless and until have different meanings. Together, they are usually excessive in normal prose. The conjunction unless means if not, or except when. The conjunction until means up to the point that, or up to the time of. When combined in “unless and until,” they add up to an overblown phrase. Usually one word or the other, depending on the context, can be scrapped with no loss of meaning. This sentence, from a book, illustrates the two words in combination: Those laws [governing matter un- der very extreme conditions] are im- 448 unemployed, unemployment 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 448"},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"portant for understanding how the universe began, but they do not affect the future evolution of the universe, unless and until the universe recol- lapses to a high-density state.

The addition of “and until” is unnecessary and more legalistic than scientific. Sometimes “or” replaces “and,” yielding the phrase “unless or until.” The result is the same. A comparable phrase is “if and when.” If means in the event that. When means at the time that. Here too one word or the other, depending on context, usually can stand alone. A variation of the phrase is “when and if.” Such phrases can be left to lawyers. See also Twins. UNLIKE. 1. Clarity. 2. Comparability. 1. Clarity Unlike can be clearer than not . . . like: “Campbell is not a college graduate, like his predecessor, Morgan.” Was Morgan graduated from college or not? If he was, a better way to begin is “ Unlike his predecessor. . . . ” But if he was not, a better way is “Like his prede- cessor. . . . ” See also LIKE, 1; NOT, 1E. Users of unlike must make it clear just what they are contrasting. The con- trasted elements need to be isolated and not obscured by modifiers. In this sen- tence from a newsletter, nine modifying words precede the noun “lift”: Unlike other GGT buses, the new Flx- ible buses features an Americans with Disabilities ACT (ADA) approved front door wheelchair lift which al- lows for a 45 -seat bus capacity. The extent of the difference between the buses is blurred by the pile-up of modi- fiers and the ambiguous “which.” See Modifiers, 4; THAT and WHICH. (An- other mistake is a noun-verb disagree- ment in number: It should be “buses feature. ” Flxible is a brand, not a mis- take.) 2. Comparability The prepositions unlike and like are opposite in meaning but alike grammati- cally. Whereas like likens one thing to another, unlike contrasts one thing with another. Either way, the things need to be comparable to make complete sense. In the use of unlike, we encounter the same problem of false comparison that was shown in the use of like. This remark was made on a national telecast: “Unlike thirty years ago, we now have sunscreens to shield us from daily exposure.” A time in the past and what we now have belong to different categories. “Unlike what we had thirty years ago . . .” is a correction. Unlike occasionally serves as an ad- jective: “the unlike duckling.” See also LIKE, 2. UNMENTIONABLE. See Verbal unmentionables. UNQUALIFIED.

Anything you can conceive is conceiv- able.

When all four pan- elists in a television discussion agreed that U.S. withdrawal from Saudi Arabia was “unthinkable” (a word suggested by the moderator), they all thought of it. The proposition might have been called unacceptable, undesirable, unfeasible, or unreasonable (or a good idea, had pan- elists been selected who did not all think alike), but was it really “unthinkable”? The same two dictionaries offer an identical second definition: “Not to be thought of or considered.” That one is more tenable. There may be certain con- cepts that, though they can be thought, should not be thought. In that sense, dic- tators regard democracy as unthinkable; and, in promoting their product, cigarette companies regard the danger to health as unthinkable. Normally you can think what you want in our society. Our laws restrict only what you do; thought- control is generally unacceptable. It is verbal profligacy to use “unthink- able” just to express disagreement with a proposition, unless it is horrible or evil beyond contemplation. To use it to de- scribe something that actually exists or has already been done (“the administra- tion’s unthinkable actions in Latin America”) is preposterous. See also Verbal unmentionables. UNTIL.

As a verb As a verb, up is more or less colloquial and not for all occasions. Using it in the (transitive) sense of raise or increase—to “up prices” or “prices were upped”—is scorned by some critics, one of whom calls it “jour- nalese.” At least one expression of that sort has become established: to up the ante, meaning to increase the stakes, par- ticularly in a poker game. To up (intransitive) is also to rise or get up, or to act unexpectedly or sud- denly: “She upped and walloped him on the jaw.” 2. In phrases When added to a number of verbs, up (adverb) forms distinctive phrases, in which up does not bear its literal mean- ing: higher or the opposite of down. Make up, for instance, can mean to put together, form, arrange, complete, compensate for, become friendly again, or put on (cosmetics). We bring up (chil- dren or topics), get up (in the morning), keep up (an activity or appearance), look up (information in a reference book), and turn up (something lacking). Up may intensify verbs, adding an ele- ment of completeness or thoroughness. Treasure-hunters dig, hoping to dig up riches. To dress is less formal than to dress up. To tear a book damages it; to tear up the book destroys it. Clean up and tie up are somewhat intensified ver- sions of clean and tie in literal senses, and they have respectively the additional meanings of make a lot of money (collo- quial) and delay or immobilize. Nevertheless, up goes unnecessarily with some other verbs, making no differ- ence in their meanings. Two professors wrote that “some of the resources freed up by pruning military outlays should permit Democrats to advance the ‘pock- etbook issues’. . . . ” No one is likely to miss “up” if it is removed from a sen- tence like that or phrases like these: “end up” (the meeting), “light up” (a cigar), “finish up” (the job), “head up” (a com- mittee), “make up” (the beds), “match up” (cloths), “open up” (the gate), “pay up” (the money), “write up” (an article). 450 until 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 450"},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"The “up” in “hurry up” / “join up” / “wait up” adds nothing to hurry, join, wait. Instead of telling someone just to lis- ten, it is fashionable (at this writing) to tack on the appendage “up.” On a radio news network, the remark “Listen up, Steven Spielberg” prefaced a broadcast of a computer-generated portrayal of a dinosaur cry. Up is the first word in sundry phrases. Among useful ones are up against, meaning confronted with; up for, pre- sented for (election, trial, etc.); up to, oc- cupied in, capable of, or equal to; and up to date, current. (“These accounts are up to date ” or “These are the up-to-date ac- counts.”) The “up” is redundant in “up until” or “up till,” inasmuch as until or till means up to a point or time. See also CAUGHT and CAUGHT UP. 3. Prefix and suffix Up- is joined as a prefix in many words. Some of them, accenting the up-, are upbeat, upbraid, upgrade, upkeep, upright, uprising, uproar, upshot, up- start, and upward. Others, such as up- heaval, uphold, upholster, and uproot, accent the second syllable. Still others give about equal stress to both syllables: upside ( down ), upstairs, upstream, and uptown. The stress may vary, as in upset: the noun is UP-set, the verb up-SET; the adjective goes either way. Dictionaries disagree on the pronunciation of some other up- words. Up is hyphenated in the adjectives up- and-coming, meaning advancing toward success; and up-and-down, meaning fluctuating in direction or vertical. As a suffix, -up may or may not be joined by a hyphen. Examples are the nouns breakup, buildup, holdup, setup, windup, close-up, make-up, and shake- up (all accenting the first syllable). As verbs, each of the root words would be separate from up. Dictionaries do not agree what to hyphenate, and several dictionaries show no pattern behind their choices. For instance, one book runs wind-up, shakeup, and a choice be- tween make-up and makeup. Another spells them windup, shake-up, and makeup. A usable rule of thumb for words with up suffixes (suggested by Roy H. Copperud) is to follow the root word with a hyphen if it ends in a vowel. See also UPCOMING; PICK UP and PICKUP; ROUND UP and ROUNDUP; SET UP and SETUP. UPCOMING. Upcoming dates back to the fourteenth century. For about 500 years it was solely a noun, meaning the action of coming up; for instance, “From the hill, we watched their upcoming.” Then it began to be used also as an ad- jective, in a similar sense, e.g., “the up- coming travelers.” Its adjectival use as a synonym for an- ticipated, approaching, coming, or forth- coming, as in “the upcoming election,” began still later. The Oxford English Dictionary can trace that “chiefly U.S.” application only as far back as 1959 . In its newest sense, upcoming has not won general acceptance. Use it if you have to, but never as a replacement for coming up, the way a telecast of enter- tainment news misused it: “With the new season upcoming, optimism is high.” The flavor is German, not En- glish. Change “upcoming” to coming up or just coming. A predecessor of the original upcom- ing, by about three centuries, was up- come, a rare verb meaning to come up. See also Backward writing, 3.

Past should be pre- sent and present should be past. “ ‘What did your name used to be?’ this reporter couldn’t resist asking.” Change “used” to use: “ ‘What did your name use to be?’ ” “I use to like people for what I could get out of them.” Change “use” to used: “I used to like people. . . . ” Used to, indicating a former state or a former activity, often is correct. But when did goes with a verb, it takes over the job of casting the verb’s action in the past. In that way, use is no different from other verbs. We say, “When did she leave? ” (not “left”) or “I did not sleep ” (not “slept”). The fact that used to and use to sound so similar can account for the confusion. In the negative, two constructions are possible. One may say either “He did not use to drink much” or He used not to drink much.” The first is more com- mon, especially in speech. The meaning of use to may be expressed in other ways: “He did not drink much in the past” or “in past years” or “in those days.” Used to can mean accustomed to. “I am used to hard work.” / “We were used to walking barefoot.” That sense em- ploys only used, the past participle, and only in the passive. UTILIZE, UTILIZATION. Utilize, often conscripted as a high-flown syn- onym for use (verb, transitive), has its niche. It implies putting to practical use something that has not been practical so far, or making something more produc- tive or profitable by finding a new use for it. These are appropriate examples: “Many companies would like to utilize the natural resources of the Antarctic.” / “Silicon was utilized in the computer revolution.” In the examples below (from a book and a newspaper), “uti- lize” is used loosely. You should be able to boost your usual weekly or monthly sales figures from time to time by utilizing one of the more popular promotional tech- niques. If the techniques are already in popular use, using will do in place of “utilizing.” To avoid becoming a rape victim, there are several precautions to follow as well as a variety of defenses to uti- lize if assaulted. Again, use is enough. Utilize would be the right word in speaking, for instance, of “a variety of common objects to uti- lize as defenses.” ( See also Crimes, 1. ) A related noun is utilization, which at times is forced to serve as a pretentious synonym for the noun use. In a dictio- nary article, a linguist describes a mil- lion-word sample of American writing containing 61 , 805 word forms. As already suggested in our discussion of the frequency of words of different length, word utilization in actual use varies enormously. The sentence would be improved by changing “word utilization in” to their. Another synonym for use is employ (verb, transitive), which has its own nu- ance: to apply or devote to an activity. “She employed her time and energy in helping the poor.” Of course employ also means to hire or to use the services of an employee. 452 utilize, utilization 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 452"},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"VASELINE.

See Confus- ing pairs. VENUE. Venue is a legal term. It is the locality in which a crime is commit- ted or the cause for a civil suit occurs. It is also the political division from which a jury is called and in which a trial is held. When a lawyer requests a “change of venue,” he wants the trial moved else- where. Lately it has been used as a highfa- lutin synonym for a variety of simple words, which would generally be quite adequate and often be more specific. It has been particularly common in show business, but some in other fields too are forcing it into service. This is from a book about marketing (emphasis added): Still, consider if this [a newsletter] is a good venue for you. . . . But particularly for consultants whose strong suit is not the written word, it [use of a newsletter service] is a plausible venue. Before “venue” began circulating pre- tentiously outside the legal community, the writer might have used medium (first sentence) and course (second sentence). A weekly newspaper chose to use “screening venue” rather than movie theater. A restaurant reviewer preferred “lunch venue” to lunchroom. A radio commercial for language instruction used “venues” in place of schools. And a notice posted at a legitimate theater an- nounced “EVENTS AT OUR OTHER VENUS” (sic). VERBAL. 1.

Oral and verbal A lawyer did not write this sentence, which is looser than it may seem. A written, detailed contract has the virtue of specifically spelling out terms and mutual obligations, but it also binds a lot tighter than a verbal agree- ment. The opposite of a written contract is an oral contract; that is, one that is spoken rather than written. All contracts or agreements are verbal, because they have to do with words, whether or not the words are written down. Verbal (adjective) pertains to words. It can have any of these senses: A. In words or through the use of words. Songs communicate in both musical and verbal ways. B. Emphasizing words as such, without regard to the ideas or facts that they convey. This is purely verbal criticism, not substantive. C. Word for word. A verbal translation is literal, rather than literary. Verbal and oral both come from Latin, in which verbum means word and oris means mouth. Oral has other mouth-related mean- ings. An oral vaccine is one that is swal- lowed. Oral hygiene is health care for the mouth. The adverbs related to verbal and oral are verbally and orally. 2. Popular definition “Verbal” often serves in popular speech as an antonym for written. Gen- eral dictionaries offer that loose use among their definitions. But why choose a fuzzy word when using a precise one is so easy? The Random House Dictionary adds a note defending the use of “verbal” to mean spoken: The practice dates from the sixteenth century; it rarely produces confusion; one can tell the meaning from the context. Contrarily, The American Heritage Dictionary (first edition) cautioned against the application of verbal to terms such as agreement, promise, commit- ment, and understanding; it can mean what is written, while oral cannot. Ver- bal (says the third edition) “may some- times invite confusion,” as in this example: Does “modern technology for verbal communication” refer to devices like radio and telephone or those like telegraph and fax? Webster’s second edition said, in the main text under verbal, that “by confu- sion” it was taken to mean spoken. Web- ster’s Third drops that qualification. 3. Technical meanings In grammar, verbal has some technical meanings. Verbal (adjective) means per- taining to a verb, or having the function of a verb, or used to form verbs (such as the verbal suffix -ize ). A verbal (noun) is a word or phrase formed from a verb that is used as a noun or adjective. Gerunds and at times infinitives and par- ticiples may be called verbals. Verbal unmentionables. Unmen- tionables is a euphemism for underwear, little used now, except in an attempt to be humorous. It was once applied to trousers. We are assigning the designa- tion of verbal unmentionables to a cate- gory of paradoxical expressions or words. What distinguishes each is that it seems to discourage any reference to the very thing it is used to refer to. If taken literally, it might not be used at all. Expressions include it (or that ) goes without saying, needless to say, not to mention, not to say, to say nothing of, and words cannot describe. Single words include inconceivable, indescribable, in- effable, inexpressible, unimaginable, un- mentionable, unsayable, unspeakable, unthinkable, and unutterable. This quirk in our language is far from new.

Using many words or too many words, either in writing or in speaking, is verbosity or wordiness. Usu- ally it means using more words than are necessary to communicate one’s mean- ing. Verbosity (pronounced vur-BOS-ih- tee) can in addition imply an instance of speech or writing that is obscure, pompous, or tedious; or a tendency to- ward such speech or writing. A noun with similar meaning is pro- lixity (pronounced pro-LIX-ih-tee), the quality of or tendency toward such ex- cessive length or elaboration in speech or writing as to be tiresome. The related adjectives are verbose (vur-BOAS), wordy, and prolix (PRO-lix or pro-LIX). Nouns pertaining to unnecessary rep- etition are pleonasm, redundancy, and tautology. See Tautology. The prose of government, academia, art, science, business, and other fields can be verbose, jargonal, or just windy. An official in southern California re- ported that an earthquake was mild by saying, “We have not activated the disas- ter mode.” To announce that an epi- demic was going away, the director of a federal health agency said, “There is a downslope on the curve of occurrence.” A Tennessee school board considering curricula decided that “pre-assessment, post-assessment, learning alternatives and remediation will be an integral part of instructional modules within the framework of program development.” A collegiate dean in Wisconsin said she had worked at “conceptualizing new thrusts in programming.” An artist wrote this of her abstract paintings: “A strong frontal progressive image of light through the layers declares the present, which is, life existing in the now.” ( See Punctuation, 3D. ) A plaque in an art gallery said of another abstract artist, “Through the use of layering, her paintings invoke a sense of continuum, a present tense portrayal that reveals a connection to our past as well as prepar- ing ground for the future.” ( See EVOKE and INVOKE. ) The beginning of a study by two pro- fessors in a scientific journal is quoted below.

In general, research on concurrent choice has concentrated on steady- state relations between the allocation of behavior and independent variables that are associated with reinforcement or aspects of responding. The devel- opment of quantitative models de- scribing stable-state choice has been successful, and is exemplified by the generalized matching law (see Davi- son & McCarthy, 1988 , for a review), which provides a description of the re- lation between behavior-output ratios and reinforcer-input ratios when two variable-interval (VI) schedules are concurrently available.

Recent decades have brought many roundabout expressions, such as “I am supportive of him” instead of I support him; “at this point in time” instead of now; “in terms of” and “all that” used unnecessarily; “for” free and listen “up”; and “person” and “people” as suffixes.

A verb is typically a word of action. It tells what someone or something does. “The boy works. ” / “This monkey howls. ” / “Paris fell on that day.” The person, creature, thing, or ab- straction—that is, the subject— need not act overtly. The subject may just exist in some way, or something may happen to the subject. The verb tells us that. “I am the captain.” / “They live in Detroit.” / “The city was besieged for two years.” B. Verb phrase A verb may consist of more than one word, usually termed a verb phrase. “The dog has eaten my manuscript.” / 456 verbs 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 456"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"“The kettle is whistling. ” / “I will re- turn. ” In each example, has or is or will serves as an auxiliary verb (also called a helping verb or just an auxiliary ). It com- bines with the main verb (the word that expresses the main action), e.g., the par- ticiple eaten or whistling or the infinitive return, in a verb phrase. Many ( composite or phrasal ) verbs have adverbial tails: burn down, check in, hold up, and so on. C. Transitive and intransitive verbs Verbs fall into two main categories: transitive and intransitive. •A transitive verb needs an object to complete the meaning. An object is that which (or one who) receives the action or is affected by it. In “He makes money,” makes is the verb; money is its object. In “Jenny plays the harp,” plays is the verb; the harp is its object. • An intransitive verb completes its meaning without needing an object. “Jesse ran. ” / “I hope. ” / “Stop!” (The subject, you, is implied.) A given verb may fit both categories or just one of them. In most general dic- tionaries, an abbreviation like v.t. (verb, transitive) or v.i. (verb, intransitive) indi- cates whether or not a verb’s particular meaning needs an object to complete it. (Some verbs that are commonly tran- sitive [requiring objects] are used intran- sitively [without objects] in legal writing. A book on law says, “The owners . . . defended on the ground that . . .”; and later, “The Supreme Court affirmed.” That is, the owners defended themselves against an accusation; and the Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the lower court. Another book says, “The Court of Appeals, after a careful review of the record, reversed.” Inasmuch as the latter book is for laymen, reversed the judgment, a transitive use of the verb, would be more idiomatic. Reverse has also a general intransitive sense: “The machine reversed.”) Confusion between the two categories comes up in ADVOCATE; CLINCH; COMMIT, COMMITTED; CULMI- NATE; LAY and LIE; LIVE, 2; OBSESS (etc.). D. Predicate Another important term is the predi- cate, the part of a sentence (or clause) that tells about the subject. It consists of the verb and any object, modifier, or complement it may have. In the sentence “Yankee Doodle went to town, riding on a pony,” everything after “Yankee Doo- dle” is the predicate. E. Objects, direct and indirect An object like dams in “He built dams” is a direct object. It tells what or who receives the action. A transitive verb may have an indirect object too. It tells to whom (or what) or for whom (or what) the action is done. In “I gave my love a cherry,” my love is the indirect ob- ject; a cherry is the direct object. F. Linking verb A special type of intransitive verb is a linking verb (also known as a copula or a copulative verb ). It links the subject with a word that identifies or qualifies it: “Tubby is a cat. ” / “We became fat. ” / “She seems happy. ” Is links Tubby with cat. Became links we with fat. Seems links she with happy. Note that it is not “happily.” The linking verb is not modi- fied. (The subjective complement, the word linked to the subject, may be a noun, adjective, or pronoun.)

Creation from nouns A group that declares its opposition to pollution says in a brochure, “Our staff attorneys and scientists . . . watchdog government and corporate actions. . . . ” The staff members may watch those ac- tions, but watchdog is a noun. They can no more “watchdog” actions than singers can “songbird” melodies. The Weather Service announced on the telephone, “Please selection the ex- panded menu for weather information.” Selection is a noun. Just as we cannot “adoption” or “perception,” neither can we “selection.” We can adopt, perceive, or select. This is not to say that a verb should never come from a noun, but those sup- posed verbs are longer than the regular verbs, fill no need, and just repeat the nouns. Some verbs formed from nouns have gained full acceptance. Among them are diagnose from diagnosis; donate from donation; edit from editor; and scavenge from scavenger. Not everyone is com- fortable with burgle from burglar, emote from emotion, and enthuse from en- thusiasm. Most accept orate, from ora- tion, in a contemptuous sense. Surveil, from surveillance, is fairly new to dictio- naries. A verb like those is called a back- formation, a word that seems to be the parent of another word but really devel- oped from the latter. Escalate, a back-formation from esca- lator, came out of the Vietnam era. Meaning to heighten (the war), the verb served a purpose. It has a shortcoming that limits its value, however. Escalators go down as well as up. Similarly, when a television reporter said, describing a traffic accident, “The car was accordioned,” how promising was that makeshift verb? An accordion may be either pulled out or squeezed in. During telecasts of the Olympic games, commentators like to say, for in- stance, “I think she has great chances here to medal”—instead of win a medal. They may find such a verb useful, but its general use should be discouraged. Sounding just like meddle, it has an in- herent potential for misunderstanding. A reporter spoke of the need “to inert fuel tanks” in airplanes. Did insert mis- lead her? Or is a national telecast an oc- casion for experimenting with verbs that have not entered the dictionaries? A columnist wrote, “If he doesn’t in- come average, Mr. Lucky’s federal in- come tax alone will be $ 456 , 400 .” We will probably not see much of that purported verb again, fortunately, for in- come averaging has since been abol- ished. 3. Mistakes in number It is an elementary rule that a singular subject takes a singular verb; a plural subject takes a plural verb. Sometimes people find it tricky to interpret or just slip up. The essential noun of the subject con- trols the number of the verb. Do not be distracted by any intervening words. That noun and its associated auxiliary verb are emphasized in these correct ex- amples: “The information about the ar- rests was released yesterday.” / “This book of new poems has just been pub- lished.” In the next example, also cor- rect, the essential noun is plural and it follows a qualifying phrase that fools some writers: “A total of 1 . 3 million votes were cast for both candidates.” See TOTAL. A cooking columnist and a news re- porter should have known better but may have been distracted by irrelevant, singular nouns: I like to serve it [a French fish dish] with croutons on top that is flavored 458 verbs 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 458"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"with olive oil and crushed black pep- per. The layoffs, which trimmed the party’s paid staff to 35 , was just the latest indication of tough times for California Democrats. The “croutons . . . are flavored. . . . ” The “layoffs . . . were just the latest. . . . ” This was reported in a radio newscast: Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, is among senators who is opposed to calling witnesses. Yes, he “is among senators,” but those senators “ are opposed.” See ONE OF, 3. Usually a subject made up of two or more nouns or pronouns (or both) that are connected by and demands a plural verb. “Frankie and Johnny were lovers.” An exception is made when the nouns or pronouns express just one idea or iden- tify just one person: “The hue and cry over this issue surprises me.” / “Our vice-president and general manager is here.” The two examples that follow call for no exception. A university president wrote that col- lege applicants need, not prestigious in- stitutions, but “the firm knowledge that their education and growth as human beings depends on themselves alone.” Change “depends” to depend. Educa- tion and growth are two ideas. Another president—of the United States this time—said, “Democracy and freedom is what the concept of the new order is about.” Make it “Democracy and freedom are. . . . ” They are two ideas. See DEMOCRACY, FREEDOM, and INDEPENDENCE. Contractions do not excuse errors in number. “Here’s the pitching probables for the three-game series against the Pi- rates . . . ,” a sports item said. “Here’s,” a contraction of “Here is,” should be Here are. See Contractions, 1. Traditionally a phrase or clause intro- duced by the expression along with, as well as, in addition to, together with, or just with does not affect the number of the verb. By that view, the expression ei- ther is not a part of the subject or is a subordinate part. (Grammarians give varying explanations.) For instance, “The farm, as well as the house, is up for sale.” A few critics allow a plural verb if the items are supposed to get equal em- phasis or if a plural feeling prevails. Nouns with exotic endings account for many errors. A common error is to mistake a plural, like media or phenom- ena, for a singular. See Plurals and singu- lars, which lists many pertinent entries. At times a group may be either singu- lar or plural, but a sentence should not treat it in both ways. See Collective nouns. The functions of many common words and phrases are often misunder- stood. They include each, every, either, neither, or, and nor and words and phrases with ( - ) one. These examples (like all those following in this section) are correct: “Each of the athletes is vy- ing . . .” / “Neither he nor I was cho- sen.” / “Everyone in these parts knows everyone else.” / “He’s one of the few people who live here.” See Number ( grammatical ) for a list of many perti- nent entries. Placing the verb before the subject does not change the need for agreement: “In this square stand the county’s first residence and the original courthouse.” When a fraction is followed by a prepositional phrase, the latter deter- mines the number: “One-fourth of our taxes go to support government waste.” / “Two-thirds of the county lies under water.” 4. Problems in using auxiliaries Sometimes it works: letting two auxil- iary verbs (helping verbs) help one main verb. “We can and must win,” for in- stance, avoids repeating “win.” But sometimes this locution turns into verbs 459 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 459"},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"a trap: “The fair shows what our county can and is accomplishing.” To say “can . . . accomplishing” is wrong, even with the two words in between. A simple correction presents the main verb twice, in the two forms needed: “. . . can ac- complish and is accomplishing.” A similar example: “This department may—and occasionally has—looked outside for its leadership.” To say “may . . . looked” is wrong. A correction fin- ishes one idea before turning to the sec- ond: “. . . may look outside for its leadership, something it has occasionally chosen to do.” Several decades ago there arose a false doctrine that declared a verb phrase to be an indivisible unit; no auxiliary verb might be separated from a main verb; any adverb must go outside that unit. By that rule, instead of saying “The facts have long been known” (correct), one had to say “The facts long have been known” (questionable). And not “The vehicle is slowly gaining speed” (correct) but “The vehicle slowly is gaining speed” (questionable). The second sen- tence of each pair is less idiomatic than the first, though clear. It may not be as clear if instead of say- ing “He appears to have partly recov- ered” (correct), one says “He appears partly to have recovered” (incorrect). Which verb the adverb belongs to may not be immediately apparent. Even conservative grammarians have no sympathy for that doctrine, which seems to have developed from the fear of splitting infinitives. It is not only permis- sible to split verb phrases but desirable when idiom and meaning so demand. Splitting infinitives is not necessarily wrong either. See Infinitive, 4. See also WHO, 3, concerning the per- son of a verb following I who or you who. 5. Shortage of objects Multiple verbs in a sentence may have the same object: “She buys, cooks, and serves food.” Buys, cooks, and serves share one object: food. If another word or phrase follows the object, the verbs may or may not share the object. Here the verbs do: “We in- vited and welcomed Ben in.” Both in- vited and welcomed fit both Ben (the object) and in. This faulty sentence is another story: “He insulted and threw the people out.” Only the second verb accepts the object ( the people ), because only that verb ac- cepts the tail word ( out ). Threw and out go together; the people is locked up be- tween them, unavailable to insulted. The defect may be fixed by relocating the noun and inserting a pronoun: “He in- sulted the people and threw them out.” A defective sentence in a biography presents four verbs that are supposed to be transitive. Only the last has an object ( them ). For the younger ones, Emma was their mother-figure, who fed, dressed, bathed, and put them to bed. The verb put goes with to bed. The ob- ject, them, is locked up in between. It is unavailable to the other three verbs, which do not go with to bed. A correc- tion is to insert another and and another them: “who fed, dressed, and bathed them and put them to bed.” VERTEBRA and VERTEBRAE. A vertebra is any one of the thirty-three bones of the spine. It is pronounced VUR-tuh-bruh. Vertebrae is plural, using a Latin form. It is pronounced either VUR-tuh- bree or VUR-tuh-bray. An alternative plural is vertebras, VUR-tuh-bruz. Said on a television news program: “She has a broken vertebrae” (-bray). Correction: “She has a broken vertebra, ” designating one of the bones, not more than one. The spine is known also as the back- bone, spinal column, or vertebral col- umn. 460 vertebra and vertebrae 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 460"},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"VERY. 1. Limitations. 2. Overuse. 1. Limitations Very is a very common word and a le- gitimate one, classified as both an adverb and an adjective. Its use as an adverb is limited and the subject of divided opin- ion. Bearing the sense of extremely or truly, very easily modifies words that are solely adjectives: large, strong, brightest. Hardly anyone would try to say, “The medicine very helps him” or “The speak- ers very praised her.” Very does not modify verbs, even though modifying verbs is a normal activity of adverbs. But may we say, “He is very helped by the medicine” or “She was very praised by the speakers”? In other words, may we use very before a past participle, which is a verb used as an adjective? Those with easy-going ears and eyes would say yes. Those who are more par- ticular would probably give a qualified no and disapprove of those examples. Such critics have included seven-eighths of The American Heritage Dictionary ’s usage panel, which rated “She was very disliked by her students” unacceptable in writing but approved “He seemed very worried.” The difference is that dis- liked— like helped and praised— is not in common use as an adjective. People do not usually speak of “the disliked teacher” any more than “the helped pa- tient” or “the praised woman.” But wor- ried, as in “the worried parents,” is considered to be a full-fledged adjective as well as a past participle. When in doubt, a writer should re- word the thought. A participle may be properly intensified in several ways, with or without very. “He is very much helped” or “ greatly helped.” / “She was very highly praised” or “ profusely praised.” When very serves as an adjective, the often precedes it, but not invariably. The adjective can mean actual (his very words), identical (this very spot), mere (the very thought), necessary (the very solution), precise (the very center), or ut- ter (the very bottom). 2. Overuse An episode in an old comedy series on television depicted an intellectually defi- cient anchor man straining to write a thoughtful essay. He could get no further than “Freedom of the press is very, very good and very, very important.” Inexperienced writers indeed tend to resort to very too freely. Speakers too, both amateur and professional, are known to overdo it. A restaurant critic on the radio described a county’s restau- rants, “some of them very, very small but all of them very, very good.” A TV re- porter said, at the scene of a search for a missing person, “The bushes get very, very thick. It would be very, very easy to lose someone out here.” A second very says nothing that the first does not say. And if one very is inad- equate, perhaps what is needed is an al- ternative adverb—or a stronger adjective and no adverb. For instance, an alterna- tive to “very, very small,” is extremely small or tiny. VIABLE. Viable (adjective) means ca- pable of living. A human fetus or a new- born is viable when it has developed to the stage at which it can survive outside the womb. Usually at twenty-eight weeks it reaches the stage of viability (noun), the capacity to live and grow. A viable seed is one that is capable of taking root and growing. The adjective or noun may be used figuratively for something that does not possess life or its potential, just as born and live may be so used: “Many doubted that the new country could survive, but it proved its viability.” The essential idea is the capability of existing and surviving. Where is that sense in the passage below, from an en- cyclopedia? viable 461 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 461"},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"The invention of the semi-conductor device known as the transistor in 1947 . . . ushered in what many have called the second industrial revolu- tion.

If the device could exist for a decade af- ter its invention and 1947 was the year of its invention, 1947 was when it be- came viable. It seemed to be viable enough then to start a revolution. If commercial, durable, effective, feasible, practical, practicable, or usable was meant, the writer should have used it. A retired appellate judge, who used to be expected to use words judiciously, said of the jury system, “I’m beginning to wonder about its viability.” How can one doubt the viability of a system that has existed for centuries? If the speaker meant advantage, benefit, usefulness, value, workability, or worth, he should have said so. Whether the age of a president mat- tered to voters was a question on a tele- vision panel. A panelist quoted Richard M. Nixon: He said he thought that the baby boomers, having seen Clinton in there, would decide that was no longer viable to have somebody [like] that. In “viable,” the panelist seems to have meant nothing more than desirable. For the four following uses, one could substitute feasible, practical, promising, or a comparable adjective. Television: “For an engineer, the standard is whether it works or whether it’s com- mercially viable.” / An editorial: “The voters . . . instructed our city officials to develop a viable plan for the water- front.” / An article: “. . . Switching to computer programming is not a viable option.” / A headline: “Private fire dept. may not be viable.” Feasibility, practicality, or a compara- ble noun could have replaced “viability” in an article: “. . . Giving the [Internet] system a new purpose has unearthed fundamental problems that could well put off commercial viability for years.” The English language adopted the French viable, likely to live, derived from vie, life, which came from the Latin vita, life.

Virtual (adjective) means being so-and-so in ef- fect or in essence, though not in actual fact or name. This is a strict use: Gorbachev . . . has calmly accepted the dissolution of what had been a vir- tual Soviet empire of Communist satellites in Eastern Europe. . . . While it was never officially called any- thing like the “Soviet Empire,” it amounted to that. Often “virtual” or “virtually” (ad- verb) becomes just a fancy way of saying near or almost. Almost would be prefer- able to “virtually” as loosely used twice in this passage: . . . Samuels has major expenses and virtually no income. . . . “Virtually everybody who knows about this has called to volunteer”. . . .

Then she would be the virtual candidate. The husband would be the official candidate, perhaps a pup- pet candidate, but not a “virtual” candi- date. In computer applications, the adjective is used for simulated: “virtual reality.” See also VIRTUE. VIRTUE. Virtue usually denotes ei- ther good moral quality (in a person) or merit (in a thing). It can also mean effi- cacy, effective force, especially the power to strengthen or heal: a drug’s virtue.

It’s available everywhere.” He was talking about the “virtue” of using the particular explosive that blasted the World Trade Center in New York. Bet- ter: “To the terrorists, the benefit of that stuff is. . . . ” An obsolete meaning of virtue is that of manly merit, courage, or strength. Those are meanings of the Latin virtus, the source of virtual and virtuoso as well as virtue. Virtus stems from vir, a man or male, the source of virile.

See -MAN-, MAN. VITAL. Vital (adjective), stemming from the Latin vitalis, of life, has essen- tially the same meaning in English: relat- ing to life, characteristic of life, essential to life, imparting or renewing life, or liv- ing. We speak of vital statistics, vital en- ergy, the vital organs, vital fluid. “When I have pluck’d the rose, I cannot give it vital growth again” (Shakespeare). In creation “the Spirit of God . . . vital virtue infused and vital warmth Throughout the fluid mass” (Milton). By figurative extension, vital is used to mean essential or indispensable to the life or existence of something. “Water is vital to agriculture.” But the word is de- graded when it replaces needed, wanted, important, significant, or less substantial adjectives. Those in the news business, enamored of short and exciting words, have long overused and trivialized vital. A copy ed- itor will choose it for a headline over needed, if not important, as a matter of course. One TV reporter called Egypt “a vital American ally” and another said, “Helicopters are vital to modern military operations”—meaning that the U.S. could not survive without Egypt or fight without helicopters? The following samples, from a head- line and two articles, may illustrate the ultimate degradation of that word of life: its application to devices for the mass de- struction of life. “How a Vital Nuclear Material Came to Be in Short Supply” / “The shortage of tritium, a vital material for nuclear weapons, arrived right on schedule.” / “The Savannah River Plant, near Aiken, is the nation’s only source of tritium, a perishable gas vital to thermonuclear warheads.” All the blame cannot be placed on the news business.

WAKE, AWAKE, AWAKEN, WAKEN. 1. First choice: WAKE (UP). 2. The other verbs. 3. Past tense; participle; other forms. 1. First choice: WAKE (UP) When the alarm clock rings in the morning, do you wake, wake up, awake, awaken, waken, or go back to sleep? The ( a ) wake ( n ) verbs, Old English de- scendants, all mean to arouse from sleep or a state like sleep, or to come out of that state. The distinctions in usage are complicated. In general, wake is the util- ity tool, good for most everyday use. The other words are substituted in figu- rative or poetic use, in the passive voice, or for the sake of formality or meter. Wake is the only one that goes with up. The up does not affect the meaning. You cannot go wrong with it. Tagging it onto wake is common and idiomatic when wake is used as an intransitive verb, especially so in the imperative and the present tense: “Wake up!” / “We wake up at 7 a.m.” In the past tense, up is optional: Either “I woke up at dawn” or “I woke at dawn” is acceptable. When wake is used as a transitive verb, it is just about as common and id- iomatic with the up as without it: “We should wake him” or “We should wake him up.” / “Don’t wake the baby” or “Don’t wake up the baby.” Unlike the other three words, wake has the additional sense of be or remain awake. It is commonly expressed in the phrase waking hours. 2. The other verbs In figurative and poetic senses, the verbs starting with a—awake and awaken— are favored: “They awakened wake, awake, awaken, waken 465 W 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 465"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"to the danger.” / “The country has awaked.” / “Awake! for morning in the Bowl of Night Has flung the Stone that puts the Stars to Flight.” Sometimes, however, the other words are so used: “Wake up, America!” In the passive voice, the words ending in n—awaken and waken— are often chosen: “The world was awakened by the event.” / “They were wakened by the bell.” Although each of those verbs has been used both transitively and intransitively, usually awake is intransitive—“She fi- nally awoke to the problem”—and awaken and waken are transitive: “Re- vere awakened the town.” / “The rooster wakens us each morning.” 3. Past tense; participle; other forms The past tense of wake is woke, and the past tense of awake is awoke. For the past participle of wake or awake, simply add d: “She had waked [or “waked up”] at 5 a.m.” / “The world has awaked.” For either the past tense or the past participle of awaken or waken, just add -ed: awakened, wakened. When a political party spokesman said on American television that “the country has woken up,” he used a par- ticiple that would have been more ac- ceptable in Britain. In the U.S. it is has (or had ) waked. In saying that “Africa . . . has awoken to life a second time,” the translator of a book used an obsolete participle. Has (or had ) awaked is the modern style. A policeman said (about the victim of an intruder), “She wasn’t positive how she became awoken.” Make it “how she became awake ” (adjective) or “how she was wakened ” (past participle). The gerund of wake —“WAKING”— is the title of Chapter XI of Lewis Car- roll’s Through the Looking Glass. The title could have been “AWAKENING,” but then it would not have rhymed with the title of Chapter X, “SHAKING.” WANT and WISH. See WISH. WARRANT. A warrant is a written authorization. A warrant of arrest, or ar- rest warrant, is a court order, usually to a law enforcement officer, to arrest some- one for a particular reason and bring him before the court. When a television newscaster an- nounced, “The FBI has issued arrest warrants for two young white men,” he was confused and inaccurate. The Fed- eral Bureau of Investigation makes ar- rests. It does not issue “warrants” for those arrests. Only a judge or magistrate may issue an arrest warrant or a search warrant. A search warrant directs a law en- forcement officer to search a person, place, or thing for property or evidence needed for a criminal prosecution and bring it before the judge or magistrate. WAS and WERE. An article said that Congress was cutting the Pentagon’s budget requests for a defense program. It commented: But even if the “Star Wars” pro- gram was not running into budgetary problems, there would be other doubts about [it]. . . . “Was” should be were. The were form (the past subjunctive of the verb be ) is used in clauses describing situations that are purely hypothetical or plainly con- trary to fact. More examples are “I wish that I were rich” and “He acted as though he were king.” When the situation is not hypothetical or contrary to fact but merely uncertain or conditional, was is the form to use (for the verb be in the third person): “She looked out to see whether it was raining.” / “He promised to cut spending if he was elected.” / “If that nugget we saw was real gold, the man struck it rich.” See also Mood; Subjunctive. 466 want and wish 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 466"},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"WATCH and WATCHDOG.

Combining singular and plural words, it is not acceptable in strict usage.

This adjective has been watered down in popular speech, particularly that of juveniles, to describe what is merely different from the norm, out of the ordinary, unconventional, or un- usual. In a TV cartoon, a husband says, “Your guitar teacher looks pretty inter- esting, and by ‘interesting’ I mean weird.” (No, he means unconventional. ) The wife replies, “Well, she is weird.” The word’s ancestor was the Old En- glish noun wyrd, meaning fate or des- tiny.

In Shakespeare’s Macbeth, the three witches call themselves “the weird sis- ters.” WELL. See AS, 5; GOOD and WELL. WENCH and WINCH. “Were you alone on the boat or was there a crew milling about with wenches and jibs and such?” The host of a television show probably was not trying to be funny when he asked that question. A wench is an archaic term for a young woman. It could refer particularly to a country girl, a maidservant, or a prostitute. Today it is used, if at all, in a humorous or facetious way. The word intended by the host was probably winch, a machine for hoisting. It has either a motor or a hand crank that winds a rope or a chain around a drum as a load is lifted. WEND and WIND. Seeing the high- way blocked by earthquake damage, Los Angeles motorists proceeded to “wind their way” either northward or south- ward. So said a newscaster on television, possibly aiming for wend but missing. To wend is to direct (one’s way) or to go. Still, if the road was a winding one, “wind” (long i, as in find ) could be ac- ceptable. A similar use was questionable in a ra- dio report on “the Chinese New Year’s parade, which is continuing to wind its way down San Francisco streets.” Wend its way ( his way, her way, etc.) is the ex- pression. The route did not wind. Some of the participants, however, carrying along stylized Chinese dragons, did pro- ceed in a twisting or curving manner, so perhaps they were winding their way. WENT.

WHEREFORE and WHEREOF. A radio host recommended a far-off restaurant. Having been there, “I know wherefore I speak,” he said. If he meant “I know what I’m talking about” and was intent on making his point through archaic language, the word to use was whereof (adverb). It can mean of which, of whom, or whence. What he said in ef- fect was “I know why I’m talking.” Wherefore (adverb) means for what, for which, or why. Shakespeare’s Juliet asks, “O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?” Wherefore is not just an elegant synonym for “where,” contrary to the belief of some. The moderator of a television forum titled a sequence, about shortcomings in the economy, “Where- fore Art Thou, Rosy Scenario?” Wherefore can also be a noun mean- ing cause or reason, as in “Never Mind the Why and Wherefore” (from Gilbert and Sullivan’s H.M.S.

Most of us probably would stick in the or not automatically, whether or not English grammar figured in our occupa- tions. Perhaps the writer of the quoted sentence gave a vague thought to the matter: Somewhere in his past, some edi- tor had instructed him that “whether” alone was enough, that “or not” was su- perfluous. At times, it is true, whether alone is enough. That is so when whether, intro- ducing an indirect question, can be re- placed by if. For example: “I asked whether [or if ] he had bought collision coverage for his car.” In such a sentence, or not is unessential, though it cannot hurt. Otherwise, whether introduces a set of possibilities or alternatives, connected by or. The gist is often that something takes place or exists regardless of other events or conditions. “We will meet whether it rains or not.” / “We will meet whether it rains or shines.” / “I’ll quit af- ter this hand, whether I win or lose.” / “The problem will persist whether one candidate or the other is elected.” In such sentences whether (conjunction) means essentially in either event. It can mean just either: “He intends to get what he wants, whether honestly or oth- erwise.” / “The cabinet was considering whether to enter the war or to remain neutral.” Or may be followed by another whether: “Whether we win or whether we lose, we’ve put up a good fight.” The extra “whether we” is unnecessary but acceptable. There may be more than two possibilities: “Whether we win, lose, or draw. . . . ” Each example below (from a syndi- cated advice column and an authorita- tive law book) contains a redundant pair of words and lacks two needed words.

An occasional expression is whether or no, meaning in any case. “The delega- tion flies home tomorrow, whether or no.” WHICH. 1. Ambiguity. 2. Overuse. 3. Parallels; people; possessives. 1. Ambiguity Everything is clear here: “Come and see the show, which opened last week.” Which (as a relative pronoun) represents the show (a noun) and introduces a clause giving further information about it. Too often, which is meant to represent something other than the normal noun or noun phrase that a pronoun is sup- posed to represent (its antecedent ). For instance: “My neighbors were celebrat- ing boisterously, which kept me up till 2 a.m.” The thing that “kept me up” may which 469 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 469"},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"be inferred, but a sharper sentence would specify it. Which might be changed to and the noise. Can which ever stand for the entire idea of a preceding statement? Maybe. It depends on one’s tolerance for disorder and whether or not the material is am- biguous. “Which” has been applied to amorphous ideas so often that when a noun does precede it, it may not be clear what “which” is meant to stand for. “The job requires her to walk dogs, which she dislikes.” Does she dislike the task or dogs? Changing “which” to ei- ther a task or animals would answer the question. Carelessness about antecedents some- times results in sentences that say the op- posite of what the writers intended. A sentence in an autobiography refers to a general: Norm Schwarzkopf did not suffer fools gladly, which you can get away with in the absolute command envi- ronment of the battlefield. “Which” has no literal antecedent. To “suffer fools gladly” seems to be it, and the “which” clause seems to say that you can do so in the environment of the bat- tlefield. The context suggests the reverse meaning: You can refuse to do so in the environment of the battlefield. This sentence from an article (in a weekly paper) deals with a presidential election campaign: Nor does he [Jerry Brown] have the money to buy TV time, which is the kiss of death in a state like Texas, with its 23 media markets. It says that “TV time . . . is the kiss of death in . . . Texas.” From the context, it appears that the writer meant roughly the opposite: The lack of television expo- sure is ruinous in Texas. (“Kiss of death” describes something that is supposedly helpful though actually harmful. In the quotation, the expression is misleading. Where is the “kiss”?) Which is more liable to cling to the closest preceding noun or noun phrase than to some vague idea in a writer’s mind. See THAT and WHICH for a discus- sion of restrictive and nonrestrictive clauses and how a failure to discriminate between them can cause confusion. 2. Overuse Journalists, with their aversion to rep- etition, are fond of the pronoun which. It permits a writer to avoid repeating a noun after the first mention. The sample below (from a picture caption) illustrates overdependence on the word. There were no injuries in the blaze, which ruined the third floor of the building, which was being remodeled. Presumably the two whiches were in- voked to prevent repetition of “blaze” and “building,” although the writer did not seem to mind the repetition of which. But it was not necessary to repeat both nouns when a personal pronoun could replace one of them. Nor did ev- erything need to be stowed into one, graceless sentence. This is a possible rephrasing: “There were no injuries in the blaze. It ruined the third floor of the building, which was being remodeled.” 3. Parallels; people; possessives A clause starting with and which nor- mally needs to follow a parallel which clause. The same principle applies to but which. See also THAT, 3; WHO, 2. “And” serves no purpose here; either replace it with a comma or insert which is after the first comma: “Acme Corp., the city’s largest employer and which re- cently announced an expansion, has been bought by a Japanese company.” If which is is inserted, the second which be- 470 which 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 470"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"comes optional: “Acme Corp., which is the city’s largest employer and [which] recently announced” etc. The clauses usually need to be truly parallel, if “and” is to make sense. This example mixes a that (restrictive) clause and a which (nonrestrictive) clause: “Buses that run during rush hours and which most passengers take will soon cost more to ride.” Delete “and” and en- close “which most passengers take” in commas. See THAT and WHICH, 1. Which refers to things, not to people. Two relative pronouns refer to people: who and that. See WHO, THAT, and WHICH. Which has two possessive forms: of which and whose.

Verb: person, number. 1. Ambiguity Which name does the “who” repre- sent in this item by a news agency? Bobbie Arnstein, executive secre- tary of Playboy magazine magnate Hugh Hefner, who was appealing a 15 -year drug sentence, was found dead today in a hotel room, an appar- ent suicide victim. The relative pronoun who tends to affix itself to the nearest preceding name or designation. In this instance it is “Hefner.” Three paragraphs later, the story makes it clear that Miss Arnstein, not Mr. Hefner, had been the convict. The clause “who was appealing a 15 - year drug sentence” should have been re- moved and turned into a separate sen- tence, with She in place of “who.” 2. Journalistic stand-by This deals mainly with the overuse of who clauses. ( See also WHO and WHOM; WHO, THAT, and WHICH. ) When a journalistic writer wants to present a fact about a person but cannot think of any logical place for it, he is li- able to put it in a clause beginning with who that he stuffs into some sentence, whether relevant or irrelevant. ( See Modifiers, 2, for other tricks.) These two sentences lead off two con- secutive paragraphs in a news story about a criminal trial: The attacker, who became known as “the South Shore rapist,” was said to have stalked his victims for days, confronted them in their bedrooms as they slept and put a screwdriver to their throats. . . . The defendant, who was ashen faced and expressionless during the announcement of the verdict, faces a maximum of life in prison. A case could be made for the who clause the first time. In the second sentence, it is irrelevant. The defendant’s facial appear- ance has nothing to do with the penalty. Later in the same story, we find these three sentences, two of them consecu- tive: Mr. C———, who spent most of his time in court taking notes, did not take the stand in his own defense. . . . Mr. C———, who was a suspect in a string of similar crimes in Florida, fell under suspicion in the Long Island attacks in November 1986 and was placed under surveillance. Mr. C———, who had served time in jail for stealing a car, was surrepti- tiously taped talking with his parole officer about his broken foot, an Alco- who 471 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 471"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"holics Anonymous meeting and other subjects. Individually the three sentences are pass- able. Each who clause pertains to the rest of the sentence. But the sum of those “Mr. C———, who” sentences does not amount to admirable style. In the last one, it seems plain that the writer re- peated the name just to follow it with “who had served” etc. The normal means of referring to the subject would be the pronoun he. “He had served time . . . and was . . .” or “Having served time . . . , he was. . . . ” In THAT, 3, and WHICH, 3, the point is made that a clause starting with and that or and which normally follows a comparable that or which clause. The principle holds for and who (and but who ): In “Adams, a candidate for mayor and who has served on the City Council for four years, said . . . ,” the “and” serves no function and ought to be deleted. It can stand if “who is” is in- serted after the first comma; if it is, the second who becomes optional: “Adams, who is a candidate for mayor and [who] has served” etc. 3. Verb: person, number In the sentence “He who hesitates is lost,” obviously who represents he (that is, he is the antecedent of who ). There- fore, the verb hesitates is right, agreeing with the subject, the pronoun he. Both words are in the third person, singular. Confusion can enter in the first or sec- ond person, singular. In an English trans- lation of a German comic opera, a man says, “It is I who are honored.” Correc- tion: “It is I who am honored.” Who does not change normal conjugations. The verb agrees with what who repre- sents; above, it represents I, which does not go with “are” or “is.” Similarly, “Is it you who have [not “has”] made the decision?” In the sentence “It is people like her who restore my faith in humanity,” re- store is the right form of the verb. The question to be asked is what who repre- sents. Here it represents certain people. It is the same when that substitutes for who. See also ONE OF, 3. WHO and THAT, WHO and WHICH. See WHO, THAT, and WHICH. WHO and WHOM. 1. The basics. 2. The critics. 3. WHOEVER and WHOMEVER. 1. The basics All speakers of the English language know the meaning of who or whom: what person(s) or which person(s). What many of us do not know is when to use each. It could be the foremost grammati- cal puzzle we face. So difficult can it be, it is no wonder that professional writers, editors, and public speakers mix up the two pronouns perpetually. In brief, who is in the subjective (or nominative) case; whom is in the objec- tive (or accusative) case. Thus the sen- tences “ Who stole my heart away?” and “I saw who slew the dragon” are cor- rect. Who is the subject of the former sentence; in the latter sentence, it is the subject of the clause “who slew the dragon.” And the sentences “I know whom she kissed” and “Never send to know for whom the bell tolls” are also correct. In the former sentence, whom is the object of the verb kissed; in the latter sentence, whom is the object of the preposition for. Often the puzzle gets more compli- cated: “The jurors disagreed on who [or whom? ] they felt had the stronger case.” Who is right; it is the subject of the clause “who . . . had the stronger case”; and the whole clause is the object of the preposition on.

(More likely, some noticed the British-style “Staff Get ” instead of “Staff Gets. ” See STAFF. ) An advertiser in the personal ads was ABANDONED By her boyfriend whom has found other interests of which she is not one of anymore. “Whom” should have been who, the subject of the verb has found, and pre- ceded by a comma. (Among the ad’s faults, “of . . . of” is redundant and “anymore” is not pertinent. Could it be that he scorned her English?) A network anchor man made a simi- lar mistake in the choice between who and whom: You’ll meet the man whom, some say, bears at least some of the blame. “. . . The man who. . . . ” Who is the subject of the verb bears; the phrase “some say” amounts to only a paren- thetical explanation. (Whether the copy that was read really had commas or not is not known, but it does not matter.) Often you can test the choice by re- ducing the sentence or clause to its bare bones and changing the w- pronoun (rel- ative pronoun) into an h- pronoun (per- sonal pronoun). The newspaper sample becomes “They thank him. ” Him is ob- jective; therefore use whom, also objec- tive. The television sample becomes “ He bears blame.” He is subjective; therefore use who, also subjective. Some may be asking, Must we solve a puzzle every time we intend to open our mouths or put pen to paper? Whom ap- pears headed the way of shall, to be re- served for special occasions but no longer of regular utility. Meanwhile, as a rule of thumb, use whom only when you are confident that it is right. When in doubt, use who. 2. The critics The use of “who” in place of a proper whom, at least in popular speech, is met with tolerance by many language au- thorities. They are less tolerant of the use of “whom” in place of a proper who. Writers and speakers so use “whom” not infrequently in the belief that it is the ob- ject of the following verb, the grammar- ian George O. Curme wrote (in the thirties). This incorrect usage was very com- mon in Shakespeare’s time: “Arthur, whom they say is kill’d tonight On your suggestion” ( King John, I, ii, 165 ). Curme could understand the popularity of who, especially at the beginning of sentences: “ Who did they meet?” is not unnatural. A contemporary of his, H. L. Mencken, wrote: The schoolmarm . . . continues the heroic task of trying to make her young charges grasp the difference. . . . Here, alas, the speechways of the American people seem to be . . . against her. The two forms of the pro- nouns are confused magnificently in the debates in Congress, and in most newspaper writing, and in ordinary discourse the great majority of Ameri- cans avoid whom diligently, as a word full of snares. When they employ it, it is often incorrectly, as in “ Whom is your father?” and “ Whom spoke to me?” In 1783 , Mencken noted, Noah Webster denounced whom as usually useless and who and whom 473 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 473"},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"argued that common sense sided with “ Who did he marry?” Theodore M. Bernstein found it un- derstandable that spontaneous speakers, lacking time for the grammatical analy- sis required, would occasionally err. However, he wrote ( 1965 ), “The trans- gressions of the writer, however, are not so easily overlooked.” Within ten years, though, Bernstein was advocating the doom of whom, its banishment from the English language, except in one context. His sole exception was “when it follows immediately after a preposition and ‘sounds natural’ even to the masses.” Examples: “To whom it may concern” / “He married the girl for whom he had risked his life.” He called whom “useless and senseless . . . a complicated nui- sance.” Of twenty-five “experts in En- glish,” fifteen agreed with him; six disagreed; four were in between. On the conservative side, Wilson Fol- lett mocked “some liberal grammarians” who opposed whom in its orthodox uses but who condoned its misuse in such sentences as these: “I know perfectly well whom you are.” [The misuser thinks “whom” is the object of know. The correct pro- noun is who, the subject of are. ] “He resists a reconciliation with his sweet wife, whom he insists is a social butterfly.” [ Who is right; “he insists” is parenthetical, as though within commas.] He suggested that the writers used “whom” wrongly for fear of sounding ignorant and that, in contrast, a histo- rian wrongly used “who” for fear of sounding superior: “M. departed eight days later in hu- miliation as the man who, more than anyone else, the President had repudi- ated.” The “radical grammarian” approves, Follett said, even though who makes you anticipate a clause of which it is the subject and leaves you jolted when you find that this clause is never coming. On the liberal side, Roy H. Copperud found “ Who are you going with?” and “ Who did you invite?” not only correct but preferable to whom. As for the use of “whom” instead of who, he accompa- nied the Shakespearean quotation of Curme’s and other classic lines with this comment: . . . When the critics of such errors must indict the translators of the Bible, together with Keats and Shakespeare, as having known no better, their preachments take on a hollow ring. . . . A century earlier, the grammar in two Biblical passages, Matthew 16:15 and Luke 9:18, had been found wanting. In the King James Version ( 1611 ) they said, respectively: He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? [H]e asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am? The English Revised Version ( 1881 ) changed each “whom” to who; and who remained in the Revised Standard Ver- sion ( 1946 ), amid modernized syntax (“who do you say . . .” / “Who do the people say . . .”). The Oxford English Dictionary finds whom “used ungrammatically for the nominative WHO” by such writers as Shakespeare and Dickens: Tel me in sadnes whome she is you loue.

WHOEVER and WHOMEVER The principles that apply to who and whom apply to whoever and whomever, which mean anyone that or no matter who. A network anchor man said: Whomever does buy the yacht will not be allowed to sail her. Whoever is the subject. A person nor- mally would say, “I wonder who will buy the yacht,” not “whom.” On a television forum, a journalist said (about a political caucus in Iowa): There are going to be stories about it, depending on whomever wins.

The poet (Shelley) could have written “. . . the loftiest tree / The thin leaves of which trembled. . . .” Fortunately he did not. 2. WHOSE and WHO’S Whose, the possessive pronoun, as in “Whose broad stripes and bright stars,” should not be confused with who’s, the contraction of who is, as in “Who’s afraid of the big, bad wolf?” A newspaper’s main story dealt with the closing of a thoroughfare (called the Great Highway) because of sand blown onto it. The headline, nearly across the front page, read: “Great Sandway - who’s fault?” The editor had erro- neously written “who’s” instead of whose. (He had also used a hyphen in- stead of a dash. See Punctuation, 4. ) Later, two magazines similarly confused those words, which are both pro- nounced HOOZ: He’s an astronaut and an older American who’s sixth sense a few years back, led him to search for the places NASA’s work might overlap. . . .

Who suits only people. That also is acceptable for people. See 2. “Who” does not belong in any of the following six excerpts. That should re- place it in the first three examples, which in the next three. (In the former group, each has a restrictive or defining clause; in the latter, a nonrestrictive or nondefin- ing clause.) The first example is a headline in a su- permarket tabloid: “Goat who ate dyna- mite is walking bomb.” A goat gets that, not “who.” (Another, typical headline in that issue: “DOG DRIVES TO HOSPI- TAL AFTER OWNER HAS HEART ATTACK IN CAR.” Would that word usage were the only problem.) Although organized entities, such as companies, unions, associations, and in- stitutions, are made up of people, they are not people. Change each “who” to that in the pair below, from a book and a newspaper. AT&T, a communications giant who never knew true competition un- til deregulation, now embraces the customer loyalty program concept. Unions who represent civil service employees argue that . . . the basic work skills needed are essentially the same. . . . A literal fish story, from a magazine, is quoted next. Sea creatures and birds, like beasts, have no claim to “who.” Unlike birds (and some solitary or pair-forming fish species), who feed or shelter their young, and mammals, who suckle them, schooling fishes abandon eggs and larvae to float away on the currents. “Unlike birds . . . , which feed or shelter their young, and mammals, which suckle them. . . .” Likewise, each “who” should be which in the pair of press sentences be- low. Countries, governmental bodies, and other geographical and political en- tities are not people, although people be- long to them.

Choice in referring to people Just as who should not represent lower creatures and things, which should not represent people. A network anchor man was out of line in telling of “an American couple which went to London” to look for a nanny. Either who or that would have been suitable in place of “which.” Both who and that are used as relative pronouns to refer to people. It is a mat- ter of personal preference. That, if chosen, should introduce only a restrictive (essential or defining) clause. “He was the best pitcher that ever joined our team.” / “The architects that de- 476 who, that, and which 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 476"},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"signed those structures display great imagination.” Who may be substituted in each instance. Further examples of the restrictive use of who have traditionally come up at political party conventions: “. . . a man who achieved . . .” / “. . . a man who represents . . .” and so on. Who (sometimes whom )—never “that” or “which”—begins a nonrestric- tive (unessential or nondefining) clause referring to a person or persons. “Do you know Helen Johnson, who used to work here?” / “The Millers, who live next door to us, came to the office to- day.” Notice that a comma precedes who in a nonrestrictive clause. A pair of commas is needed when the nonrestric- tive clause does not end the sentence. H. W. Fowler, the grammarian, not only condoned the application of that to people: he proposed “the establishment of that as the universal defining relative, with which & who ( m ) as the non- defining for things & persons respec- tively.” If politeness stood in the way, Fowler had a subtle compromise: At least save who for particular persons (“You who are a walking dictionary”) and that for generic persons (“He is a man that is never at a loss”). There has been little movement to- ward applying that to people. Fowler was more successful in getting that ac- cepted as a restrictive (defining) relative pronoun for nonhuman subjects. Con- ceding that his proposal might not win out, he added a caveat that remains im- portant: Failing the use of that as the only defining relative, it is particularly important to see that who defining [restrictive] shall not, & who non- defining [nonrestrictive] shall, have a comma before it.

Willy-nilly (adverb) essentially means without choice, under compulsion. “The soldiers were sent willy-nilly into a perilous land.” It is the remnant of an aged expres- sion: will he, nill he, meaning whether he will it or not will it; that is, whether he is willing or unwilling. Any other personal pronoun could be substituted. Shake- speare used the expression in The Tam- ing of the Shrew: “. . . Your father hath consented / That you shall be my wife; your dowry ’greed on; / And, will you, nill you, I will marry you.” To will, or to desire, is still used. To nill (descended from the Old English nyllan ) is an obso- lete verb, meaning not to will, not to de- sire. Do not confuse nill with the noun nil, nothing (from the Latin nihil ). Willy-nilly (adjective) means being or occurring whether one wishes it or not: “a willy-nilly experience.” Sometimes the word is used loosely as a synonym for indecisive (adjective), (possibly under the influence of shilly-shallying ). Some users wholly misunderstand willy-nilly, projecting sundry meanings into it. The host of a radio talk show said fi- nancial considerations had to moderate expenditures for highway safety: “We can’t just go out and willy-nilly do what- ever we think is going to be helpful.” Any of a number of adverbs would have fit better: at will, exorbitantly, extrava- gantly, freely, limitlessly, unlimitedly, un- restrainedly. Each suggests that the action would be performed willingly. The speaker chose a word with the op- posite sense. The chairman of a Senate committee that was conducting an investigation willy-nilly 477 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 477"},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"said, when asked if the president would be subpoenaed, “You don’t send off sub- poenas willy-nilly.” Certainly you don’t send off subpoenas unwillingly; the re- cipient is the one who must act willy- nilly. The senator may have meant carelessly, hastily, thoughtlessly, or one of the previously mentioned adverbs. WINCH. See WENCH and WINCH. WIND SHEAR. See SHEAR, 2. -WISE ending. They must think that adding a -wise to the word is efficient: • A radio reporter asked a heart- attack specialist, “Where does the future lie technology-wise?” The reporter probably believed she was using language sharply and economically by tacking “-wise” onto the noun instead of having to say “as far as technology is concerned.” But a crisper question would be, “What technology lies ahead?” or “What inventions are needed?” • A lawyer used similarly roundabout language in commenting on a defendant’s performance in court: “Demeanor-wise he’s coming off fine. Testimony-wise he couldn’t be worse.” The lawyer could have said, in a more straightforward way, “His demeanor is fine. His testimony couldn’t be worse.” Although -wise has long been scorned as a suffix taking the place of concern- ing, with reference to, or with respect to, it does have legitimate functions in two other senses. It signifies ( 1 ) direction or manner, as in clockwise and otherwise, and ( 2 ) knowledge or wisdom, as in penny-wise and worldly-wise. In those two functions it roughly par- allels the word wise, meaning (noun) manner, method, or way and (adjective) possessing wisdom, shrewdness, pru- dence, or erudition. The noun is used mainly in the phrases in any wise, in no wise, and in this wise. WISH. A supermarket posted a sign saying, “If you wish for canned SALMON please ask checker at check- stand for it.” To wish for something is to possess or express a longing or deep, heartfelt desire for it. The phrase can ad- ditionally mean to seek to acquire or achieve the thing by supernatural means, through the medium of a genie, fairy, shooting star, wishing well, birthday cake, or chicken bone. “If you wish canned salmon,” omit- ting the “for,” would have been an im- provement, although a number of critics consider the verb wish followed by a simple object to be a genteelism, an ex- cessive refinement. Want is the verb to use in that grammatical context, particu- larly when the desire is so prosaic or transitory. To wish blends well with an indirect object (“I wish you luck”), a clause (“I wish I had a nickel”), or an infinitive (“Do you wish to file a complaint?”). With an infinitive, want works as well or better. Wit. See QUIP, QUIPPED. WITH. 1. Common misuse. 2. Func- tion; meanings; number. 1. Common misuse It is an amateurish practice to fasten an extra thought to a sentence by the use of a nearly meaningless “with.” Yet the practice is habitual in the popular press, even among the best newspapers. A front-page story in a leading daily pro- vides three illustrations. (Emphasis is added.)

An alternative to two separate sentences is two independent clauses, separated by a semicolon: Complexity has become a signifi- cant bottleneck in computing; design- ers find that. . . . (In the third paragraph of the excerpt, “having their product” is questionable. Better: “having its product” or “having products. ”) Another typical example, from the front page of a mainly financial newspa- per, concerns a South African election: But the trend was unmistakable, with the ANC capturing more than 60 % of the vote. The sentence is shorter and plainer than the previous samples, but “with” is just as inane. Take it out and see if the sen- tence needs it. Or follow “unmistak- able” with a colon, semicolon, or dash and “the ANC captured more than 60 % of the vote.” Or follow the comma with “ and the ANC captured ” etc. In the following sentence, “with” is not just wishy-washy; it can send readers down the wrong track. Luaus are still popular on Oahu with everyone eventually succumbing to their lure. “Luaus are still popular on Oahu with everyone” forms a complete thought, but not the writer’s thought. Any of these could replace “with”: a comma; a semicolon and the clause “everyone eventually succumbs to their lure”; a comma and where or and followed by that clause; a period and a new sentence worded like that clause. Journalists often treat repetition like the plague, but the writer of the follow- ing sentence did not seem to mind the “with . . . with.” At the same time, Syria rejected the P.L.O.’s discussion with the United States, with official newspapers declaring that peace in the Middle East “should be taken by force.” When repeating a word helps to make a sentence clear, one need not shun repeti- tion, particularly when the meaning of the word is the same. In the excerpt, however, the first with indicates interac- with 479 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 479"},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"tion; the second has negligible meaning and can mislead readers. After “United States,” a new sentence is desirable: “Of- ficial newspapers declare that. . . . ” (The double “with” in the opening example is less conspicuous.) The “with” form is not restricted to newspapers. A scholarly book uses it six times; for example: And Griswold v. Connecticut ( 1965 ) created a new constitutional right to privacy, with the opinions in the case basing this right on several provisions of the Constitution. Omitting “with the opinions in the case” would sharpen the sentence. Before attaching an extra thought to a sentence, a writer needs to consider how the extra thought relates to the first thought; and whether or not it must be attached; and, if it must, whether or not the connecting word, phrase, or punctu- ation shows the relation. 2. Function; meanings; number Unlike and, with is not a connecting word, or conjunction, the way it is most often misused. It is a preposition, like of, by, and for. ( See Prepositions, 1. ) Its dozens of senses include the fol- lowing: accompanying (“The Smiths are with their children”), agency (“Clean it with soap and water”), association (“Dessert comes with the dinner”), cau- sation (“They wept with joy”), closeness (“She’s sitting with that soldier”), con- trast (“The Earth is tiny compared with Jupiter”), entrusting (“Leave it with the receptionist”), manner (“She sang with feeling”), membership (“Are you with us?”), opinion (“It’s all right with me”), opposition (“He argued with the um- pire”), possession (“Who is the boy with the drum?”), presence (“It’s filled with helium”), and relationship (“He’s friendly with people”). When with has the sense of accompa- nying, does a singular verb remain singu- lar? “The computer with the printer costs [or “cost”?] $ 1 , 900 .” What of along with or together with? “Mr. Far- rell, along with his son, is [or “are”?] ar- riving this evening.” The established view is that the verbs remain singular: costs, is, etc., inasmuch as with is a preposition and not a con- junction. But some grammarians allow a plural verb if the items or individuals get equal emphasis. Despite the many meanings of with, it is sometimes chosen over more appro- priate prepositions. An ad announced a lecture entitled “The Rules” by two au- thors (of a book by that name): “Proven Secrets for dating and marrying Mr. Right with ELLEN FEIN and SHERRIE SCHNEIDER. . . . ” Would that make him a bigamist? Maybe no one really thought so, but by would have been bet- ter than “with.” WITHER and WRITHE. “That person you can see withering in pain . . .”—it should be writhing in pain. An anchor man made the mistake on a national telecast. He confused two verbs (intransitive) that look somewhat similar but have different meanings, pronuncia- tions, and Old English origins. To wither is to dry up, lose freshness, or shrivel. To writhe is to squirm, twist, or contort the body. Each verb has a transitive sense, meaning to cause (some- thing or someone) to have the particular effect. The first word is pronounced WITH-er, the second RYTH (each th voiced as in THE). WITH PREJUDICE and WITH- OUT PREJUDICE. The defense in the O. J. Simpson murder trial made a motion. A radio newscaster said the mo- tion was “that charges against Simpson be dismissed without prejudice, meaning he could not be tried again.” She got it backward. 480 wither and writhe 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 480"},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":"When a legal action is dismissed with- out prejudice, it is as though the case were never brought to court. It means (in a criminal case) that the prosecuting side may try the defendant again on the same charges, or (in a civil case) that the plain- tiff may bring a new suit on the same claim. Conversely, the dismissal of a legal ac- tion with prejudice amounts to a final judgment on the merits of the case. It bars any new prosecution on the same charge or any new suit on the same claim. A defense attorney in any legal case wants the court to dismiss the case with prejudice, for then the defense has won. That was the motion of the Simp- son defense. Those legal uses of prejudice (noun) have little to do with its common use to signify bias. However, witnesses and oc- casionally jurors or judges may be said to harbor common prejudice, either an- tagonism or favoritism. Prejudicial (adjective) is often used in legal contexts to mean harmful to the rights of a party, whether because of bias, emotion, or error. Literally prejudice means prejudg- ment. It originates in the Latin praejudi- cium, same meaning, from prae, before, and judicium, judgment. WOMAN. See -MAN-, MAN. WOOD and WOODEN. A fire was caused by children who put paper towels close to what a radio newscaster called “a wooden stove.” He must have meant a wood stove or wood-burning stove. Obviously you could not have a stove made of wood. Wood is a perfectly good adjective; it means containing, used on, or related to wood, or existing in a wood or forest. Moreover, wood is an alternative to wooden, meaning made of wood; for in- stance, both a wooden bowl and a wood bowl are right. WORDINESS, WORDY. See Ve r - bosity. Words that sound alike.

A television reporter predicted that the traffic pattern on a main thoroughfare during a forth- coming municipal event would “wreck some havoc.” Whether she mistook “wreck” for wreak or simply did not know that the latter should be pro- nounced REEK is not clear. Hurricanes and tornadoes wreak, that is, inflict, havoc. It is not possible to “wreck” havoc, because to wreck is to destroy and havoc is destruction. As for the TV prediction, to wreak havoc would be an overstatement—the traffic pattern would more likely cause confu- sion or something of the sort—unless the reporter foresaw some destructive acci- dents. See also RACK and WRACK. WREST and WRESTLE. “. . . The guerrillas slowly wrestled victory from black Africa’s biggest army,” a front- page newspaper story said.

For a passage about gorillas that really wrestle, see the next entry. WRESTLE, WRESTLING and RASSLE, RASSLING. A sign at a zoo’s gorilla enclosure said, in part: “Through games of chasing and rassling, the bonds of trust and friendship are formed.” The standard noun is wrestling, the standard verb wrestle. “Rassling” or “rassle” is dialectic or very informal, not on the same plane as a fancy phrase like “the bonds of trust and friendship.” Other deviant spellings are rassel, ras- tle, wrassle, and wrastle.

Either use a capital X, if it is indeed the Xerox brand, or call the device a copier, copying machine, photocopier, or the like. Xerox is a trademark. Capital- ize it, just as you would capitalize the name of any similar machine labeled Canon, Kodak, Konica, Minolta, Mita, Panasonic, Ricoh, Royal, Savin, Sharp, or Toshiba. The dry photographic process that the various copiers use is xerography, from the Greek xeros, meaning dry, and graphein, to write. To make a photocopy of a docu- ment is to photocopy it or, if the con- text makes it clear, simply to copy it. “Xerox” as a verb is questionable. The pronunciation is ZEER-ox. -Y ending. 1. Conjugation. 2. Suf- fixes. 1. Conjugation A national advice columnist advised mothers of young children to quiz them on the details of any trips taken with family friends or relatives. The headline, in at least one newspaper, was “Be Happy She Prys.” “Prys” was a misspelling. Pries is right. She or he pries. I, we, you, or they pry. The past tense and past participle of pry is pried, for all persons. The conjugation of a verb ending in y may depend on whether a consonant or a vowel precedes the y. A. Preceded by a consonant. In the present tense, the y is replaced by -ies for the third person, singular (e.g., he or she). In the past and perfect tenses, the y is usually replaced by -ied for all persons. Otherwise the verb is not changed. Thus he, she, or the baby cries (not “crys”). I, we, you, they, he, or she cried, had cried, and have cried. I, we, you, or they cry. Everyone is crying, will cry, and would cry. The forms are similar for the other -ry verbs ( dry, fry, try ); the -fy verbs ( am- plify, beautify, clarify, classify, defy, elec- trify, qualify, and so on); the -ply verbs ( apply, comply, imply, multiply, ply, re- ply, supply, etc.); and miscellaneous -y ending 483 X Y Z 04-R–Z_4 10/22/02 10:33 AM Page 483"},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"other y-ending verbs ( ally, deny, proph- esy, spy ). Fly has its own irregularity in the past tense: You, I, he, or any other person flew. (He flied is right only in baseball.) It is like the other -ry verbs in the present tense: I fly, he flies, and so on. B. Preceded by a vowel. Usually a verb in which the final y follows a vowel is conjugated normally. He or she prays or employs. I, we, you, and they pray or employ. All persons prayed or employed. And so on. For some exceptions, see LAY and LIE; MAY and MIGHT; PAY; SLAY, SLAIN, SLEW. 2. Suffixes There are general rules for adding a suffix to a basic word ending in y. They depend on whether a consonant or a vowel precedes the y. The rules have many exceptions. A. Preceded by a consonant. If a con- sonant precedes the y, usually the y changes to i— unless the suffix begins with i. Some examples are the change of beauty to beautiful and beautify; happy to happily and happiness; and holy to holier and holiest. While cry becomes crier and defy becomes defiant, both re- tain the y when -ing is added: crying, de- fying— the suffix begins with i. Among exceptions are dryness, baby- hood, and ladylike. The change of ac- company to accompanist and the changes of military to militarism and militarize are exceptions to the i- suffix exception. To make a common noun like army, lady, or sky plural, -ies is added: armies, ladies, skies. When a proper noun is made plural, the y remains: Germanys, Marys. The y remains when a possessive ’s is added: anybody’s, everybody’s, Harry’s, Mary’s. B. Preceded by a vowel. If a vowel precedes the y, usually the y remains. Ex- amples are enjoyment, joyous, obeyer, payable, and playful. Among exceptions, day changes to daily; and gluey changes to gluier and gluiest. Adjectives that end in -wy, like chewy, dewy, showy, and snowy, change the y to i: dewier, showiness, etc. To make a noun like d ay, key, or toy plural, add s. But the plural of colloquy is colloquies. As suggested in Spelling, 3: when in doubt, look it up. “YES, VIRGINIA.” If Francis P. Church, the editor of The Sun in New York, had known what his poetic edito- rial was starting, he might have re- sponded differently to the eight-year-old girl who wrote in 1897 to ask, “Is there a Santa Claus?” (Perhaps, “No. Sorry, Virginia, but that’s the way it is.”) Seven words—“Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus”—have become hackneyed. Imita- tors, who may never have read the whole editorial, appropriate from two to five words for conversion to a variety of uses. (An ad for a general store:) “Yes, Vir- ginia, There is an After Christmas SALE.” (A subtitle of a network TV fo- rum:) “Yes, Virginia, there are four can- didates [for governor of Virginia].” (A local TV newscast:) “Yes, Virginia, it can snow in San Francisco.” (A column:) “Yes, Virginia, computers make mis- takes.” (An editorial:) “No, Virginia, there is no incumbent-protection plan.” The writer of the last sentence did not even keep the “Yes.” It is puzzling why he had to drag Virginia into it at all.

The precise modifier would have been Yiddish, pertaining to the language. Jew- ish is not a language and not a synonym for Yiddish, although using it that way is a common mistake, rather than a blun- der. That apparently occurred in Israel. Later in the same book we read: In Jerusalem my counterpart . . . , the Israeli chief of staff, threw a party for me, at which I surprised the guests with some Bronx-acquired Yiddish.

Your and you’re, pronounced alike, should not be confused in writing. Your, as in “To your health,” is the possessive form of the pronoun you.

Or maybe you will. Z. The twenty-sixth and last letter of the English alphabet is pronounced in two ways. The American way is ZEE. The British way is ZED. The pronunciation of z comes up in a book by a scientist. A passage describes a modern theory in physics (unifying the electromagnetic force and the weak nu- clear force): . . . In addition to the photon, there were three other spin- 1 particles, known collectively as massive vector bosons, that carried the weak force. These were called W + (pronounced W plus), W − (pronounced W minus), and Z 0 (pronounced Z naught). . . . The author has told us how to pro- nounce the 0— as naught (NAUT)—but not how to pronounce the Z. He is British. The theory was propounded by two academics, one in the United States and one in Britain. The book was pub- lished simultaneously in the United States and in Canada, where ZED is pre- ferred. See also ZERO and O. ZERO and O. The figure 0 is a zero or cipher or naught (also spelled nought ), the arithmetical symbol for nothing or the absence of any quantity.
