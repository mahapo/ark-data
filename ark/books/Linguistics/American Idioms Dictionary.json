TLFeBOOK"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"vii To the User All languages have phrases or sentences that cannot be understood liter- ally. Even if you know the meaning of all the words in a phrase and under- stand all the grammar of the phrase completely, the meaning of the phrase may still be confusing. Many proverbs, informal phrases, and common say- ings offer this kind of problem. A phrase or sentence of this type is said to be idiomatic. This dictionary is a collection of the idiomatic phrases and sentences that occur frequently in American English. The third edition contains more than one thousand idiomatic expressions not listed in the second edition and a number of new features that provide additional con- venience and simplicity. Using the Dictionary 1. Start by looking up the complete phrase that you are seeking in the dic- tionary. Each expression is alphabetized under the first word of the phrase, except the words a , an , and the . After the first word, entry heads are alphabetized letter by letter. For example, in so many words will be found in the section dealing with the letter i . Entry phrases are never inverted or reordered like so many words, in ; words, in so many ; or many words, in so . Initial articles— a , an , and the —are not alpha- betized and appear in a different typeface in the entry. In the entry heads, the words someone or one stand for persons, and something stands for things. These and other generic expressions appear in a dif- ferent typeface. 2. If you do not find the phrase you want, or if you cannot decide exactly what the phrase is, look up any major word in the phrase in the Phrase- Finder Index, which begins on page 447. There you will find all the phrases that contain the key word you have looked up. Pick out the phrase you want and look it up in the dictionary. 3. An entry head may have one or more alternate forms. The entry head and its alternates are printed in boldface type , and the alternate forms are preceded by “ and .” Two or more alternate forms are separated by a semicolon (;). 4. Many of the entry phrases have more than one major sense. These senses are numbered with boldface numerals. TLFeBOOK"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"0 5. Individual numbered senses may have additional forms that appear in boldface type , in which case the and and the additional form(s) follow the numeral. 0 6. The boldface entry head (together with any alternate forms) is usu- ally followed by a definition or explanation. Explanations are enclosed in angle brackets (< and >), and explain or describe the entry head rather than define it. Definitions take the form of words, phrases, or sentences that are semantic equivalents of the entry head. Alternate definitions and restatements of the definitions are separated by a semicolon (;). These additional definitions are usually given to show slight differences in meaning or interpretation. Sometimes an alter- nate definition is given when the vocabulary of the first definition is difficult. 0 7. Some entries include instructions to look up some other phrase. For example: scarcer than hen’s teeth Go to (as) scarce as hen’s teeth . 0 8. A definition or explanation may be followed by comments in paren- theses. These comments tell about some of the variations of the phrase, explain what it refers to, give other useful information, or indi- cate cross-referencing. 0 9. Some definitions are preceded by additional information in square brackets. This information makes the definition clearer by supplying information about the typical grammatical context in which the phrase is found. 10. Sometimes the numbered senses refer only to people or things, but not both, even though the entry head indicates both someone or some- thing . In such cases, the numeral is followed by “[with someone ]” or “[with something ].” 11. Examples are introduced by a \u0001 or a T and are in italic type . The T introduces an example containing two elements that have been trans- posed, such as a particle and the object of a verb. This is typically found with phrasal verbs. 12. Some entry heads stand for two or more idiomatic expressions. Paren- theses are used to show which parts of the phrase may or may not be present. For example: (all) set to do something stands for all set to do something and set to do something .

For instance, [heart stands still] Go to one’s heart stands still . <....> enclose a description of or explanation about an entry head rather than a definition. For instance, Finders keepers(, losers weepers). <a phrase said when something is found.> \u0001 (a box) marks the beginning of an example. T (a box containing a “T”) marks the beginning of an example in which two elements of the phrase, usually a particle and an object, are trans- posed. and indicates that an entry head has variant forms that are the same or similar in meaning as the entry head. One or more variant forms are preceded by and . entry block is the body of an entry starting with a boldface word or phrase type and running to the next boldface word or phrase. entry head is the first phrase or word, in boldface type, of an entry block ; the phrase or word that the definition explains. go to means to turn to the entry head indicated. see also means to consult the entry head indicated for additional infor- mation or to find expressions similar in form or meaning to the entry head containing the see also instruction. Type Styles Entry heads are printed in boldface type , e.g., Join the club! Variable parts of an entry are printed in condensed type , e.g., just the same (to someone ) . Entry heads being referred to as cross-references are printed in sans serif type , e.g., get the short end of the stick . Variable parts of cross-references are printed in light condensed type , e.g., ease off (on someone or something ) .

NTC’s American Idioms Dictionary x TLFeBOOK"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"xi About This Dictionary NTC’s American Idioms Dictionary is designed for easy use by lifelong speakers of English, as well as the new-to-English speaker or learner. The dictionary uses 14,000 examples to illustrate the meanings of approximately 8,500 idiomatic forms in 7,500 entry blocks. An appendix includes 500 irreversible binomial and trinomial phrases. The dictionary contains a unique Phrase-Finder Index that allows the user to identify and look up any expression in the dictionary from a single key word. This is a dictionary of form and meaning. It focuses on the user’s need to know the meaning, usage, and appropriate contexts for each idiomatic phrase. Specialized knowledge of English lexical and senten- tial semantics and English grammar is not used in indexing, defining, or explaining the idiomatic expressions. English is a highly variable language. American English has dif- ferences that correlate with geographical location, the level and regis- ter of use, and other differences that relate to characteristics of the speaker. To include examples that would represent all kinds of Amer- ican English as spoken by all kinds of speakers is not possible. The kind of American English used in the dictionary is generally what one would expect to hear used by educated, polite individuals representative of the traditional American home, family, and community. It is widely used in the United States and understood by English speakers throughout the country. Idioms or idiomatic expressions are often defined as “set phrases” or “fixed phrases.” The number of idiomatic expressions that are totally invariant is really quite small, however, even when the English proverbs are included in this category. Most such phrases can vary the choice of noun or pronoun and most select from a wide variety of verb tense and aspect patterns. Adjectives and some adverbs can be added at will to idiomatic phrases. Furthermore, the new-to-English user is faced with the difficulty of isolating an idiomatic expression from the rest of the sentence and determining where to find it in a dictionary of idioms. If the user fails to extract the essential idiomatic expression, the likelihood of finding it in any dictionary is reduced considerably. TLFeBOOK"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"In dictionaries that list each idiomatic expression under a “key word,” there may be some difficulty in deciding what the “key word” is. In phrases such as on the button or in the cards , the key word, the only noun in the phrase, is easy to determine if one has correctly isolated the phrase from the sentence in which it was found. In phrases that have more than one noun, such as all hours of the day and night or A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush , deciding on a “key word” may be more difficult. It is even more difficult when the only noun in the phrase is one of the variable words, such as with go around with her o l d f r i ends , go around with J im , an d go around with no one at a l l , which are examples of go around with someone . This dictionary uses the Phrase-Finder Index to get around the problems users face with trying to isolate the complete idiom and try- ing to predict its location in the dictionary. Simply look up any major word—noun, verb, adjective, or adverb—in the Phrase-Finder index, and you will find the form of the entry head that contains the defini- tion you seek. Another important feature for the learner is the use of object placeholders indicating human and nonhuman. Typical dictionary entries for idiomatic phrases—especially for phrasal verbs, preposi- tional verbs, and phrasal prepositional verbs—omit direct objects, as in put on hold , bail out , or see through . This dictionary uses the stand-in forms such as someone , something , some amount , or somewhere for variable objects and other variable forms. These stand-in forms are in condensed type . All of that information is vital to learners of English, although it seems to come perfectly naturally to lifelong English speakers. For example, there is a big difference between put someone on hold and put something on hold , or between bail someone out and bail something out . There is also a great difference between see some- thing through and see through something . These differences may never be revealed if the entry heads are just put on hold , bail out , and see through , with no object indicated. Many idioms have optional parts. In fact, a phrase may seem opaque simply because it is really just an ellipsis of a longer, less opaque phrase. This dictionary shows as full a form of an idiom as possible with the frequently omitted parts in parentheses. For example: back down NTC’s American Idioms Dictionary xii TLFeBOOK"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"(from someone or something ) , be all eyes (and ears) , and (every) once in a while . The dictionary includes numerous irreversible binomials and tri- nomials—sequences of two or three words that are in a fixed order, such as fast and furious , but not furious and fast . These sequences are listed in the Appendix, beginning on page 621, and those that require explanation are cross-referenced to entries in the dictionary. The compiler has included idiomatic phrases drawn from or suggested by Anne Bertram in NTC’s Dictionary of Proverbs and Clichés , NTC’s Dictionary of Euphemisms , and NTC’s Dictionary of Folksy, Regional, and Rural Sayings and Eliza- beth Kirkpatrick in NTC’s English Idioms Dictionary .
