TLFeBOOK"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Introduction NTC’s Pocket Dictionary of Words and Phrases is for persons who are seeking to improve their ability to speak, read, write, and understand American English. It is a small, portable dic- tionary that will help learners with spelling, pronunciation, parts of speech, meaning, irregular forms, and the appropri- ate use of 12,000 common words and phrases. This dictionary defines words using the smallest possible vocabulary, but when it is necessary, additional words are used to define difficult concepts. In many cases, more than one def- inition is given, so the learner has additional help in figuring out the meaning of a word or expression. Phrases are entered in the dictionary in their normal alpha- betical positions. Phrases are also indexed within the diction- ary by means of cross-references. A cross-reference to each phrase is found at the entry of each non-initial, major word in the phrase. Thus, after account we find the cross-references: → cook the accounts → give a good account of oneself → savings account → turn something to good account These cross-references enable a reader who can’t remem- ber an exact phrase to find it just by looking up one of the phrase’s key words. vii 01 7/23/03 8:33 AM Page vii Copyright 2003 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc .

TLFeBOOK"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"How to Use This Dictionary Many of the entry words in the dictionary have more than one sense. Please study all the relevant senses to make sure you have found the right one. Nominals ( n. ) that do not follow the regular spelling or pronunciation rules in the formation of the plural are marked irreg. , and the form of the plural is given in the entry. Verbs ( tv., iv. ) that do not follow the regular rules for the formation of the past tense and past participle are marked irreg. , and the proper forms are given in the entry. The comparative and superlative forms of adjectives ( adj. ) and adverbs ( adv. ) are listed when there are forms—as with red , redder , reddest —that replace, or that exist in addition to, the comparatives and superlatives formed with more and most . After many of the definitions, you will find comments, enclosed in parentheses, containing further information about the entry word. Keep in mind that the goal in using a monolingual learner’s dictionary is not only to find the meanings of specific words, but also to develop the skills needed to acquire new words and senses of words from their actual use in context. ix 01 7/23/03 8:33 AM Page ix Copyright 2003 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc .

Words that have important irregular forms that do not fol- low these rules are identified in the dictionary. Regular Verb Forms Note: Many verbs that have irregular past-tense forms or irregular past participles nevertheless form the present tense and the present participle regularly. For the third-person singular (the form used with he , she , it , and singular nouns) in the present tense: \u0002 Add -s to the bare verb. If the bare verb ends in y preceded by a consonant, change y to ie and then add -s . If the bare verb ends in s , z , x , ch , or sh , add -es . like > Bill likes cry > the baby cries walk > Anne walks buy > the man buys carry > a truck carries fix > she fixes pass > it passes notify > he notifies catch > she catches xi 01 7/23/03 8:33 AM Page xi Copyright 2003 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc .

If the bare verb ends in y preceded by a consonant, change y to i before adding -ed . If the bare verb ends in e , just add -d . walk > walked like > liked judge > judged try > tried carry > carried measure > measured For the present participle: \u0002 Add -ing to the bare verb. If the bare verb ends in a single e preceded either by a consonant or by u , drop the e before adding -ing . If the bare verb ends in ie , change ie to y before adding -ing . judge > judging take > taking ask > asking carry > carrying pay > paying pursue > pursuing hoe > hoeing see > seeing go > going lie > lying Useful Spelling Rules xii 01 7/23/03 8:33 AM Page xii TLFeBOOK"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Doubling of consonants in participles and past-tense forms: \u0002 When -ed or -ing is added to a word that ends in a conso- nant (other than h , w , x , or y ) preceded by a single vowel, and the final syllable is stressed, then the consonant is normally doubled. Thus commit and control , which are accented on the last syllable, become committed and con- trolling , but limit and cancel , which are accented on the first syllable, become limited and canceling . Similarly, stop becomes stopping , but look , in which the consonant is pre- ceded by two vowels, becomes looking . Within the dictionary, forms that do not follow these doubling rules are noted in individual entries. The most typ- ical exceptions to the doubling rules are words with a final c that becomes ck rather than doubling, e.g., picnicking , verbs that are compounds, and verbs with closely related noun senses or more than one pronunciation. Outside the dictio- nary, learners will encounter other exceptions, as well as some variation, because sometimes another option, al- though less familiar in American English, is also correct. Regular Noun Plurals To form the plural of a regular noun: \u0002 If the singular form ends in s , z , x , ch , or sh , add -es . kiss > kisses box > boxes match > matches dish > dishes bus > buses Useful Spelling Rules xiii 01 7/23/03 8:33 AM Page xiii TLFeBOOK"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"\u0002 If the singular form ends in y preceded by a consonant, change y to ie and then add -s . baby > babies library > libraries university > universities butterfly > butterflies \u0002 For nouns ending in o , the regular plural form may be formed by adding -es or by adding -s . For some words, both spellings are possible. In this dictionary, each entry for a noun ending in o specifies the correct plural form or forms for that word. radio > radios potato > potatoes tornado > tornados or tornadoes \u0002 For all other regular nouns, add -s to the singular form to make the plural. table > tables boy > boys television > televisions valley > valleys An Important Note on the English Plural The English plural is something that makes English very dif- ficult for adults to learn.

There are many American English nouns in this dictionary that the learner should not attempt to make plural—ever! See a list of these nouns in List A on page xvii. In addition, there are many nouns in English that can be followed by the plural s that seem to be plural, but really refer to kinds or types of the noun in question. In the following entry, when the word margarine has an s on the end, it refers to different kinds, types, or varieties of margarine . margarine [ \"mar dZ@ rIn ] n. a food made from animal or vegetable fats, used in place of butter; a spread for bread.

The speech represented here is that of educated people, but it is not formal or overly precise. It is more representative of the West and the middle of the country than of the East, South, or upper Midwest. Pronunciation of American English is variable in different regions of the country, but most native speakers of American English can understand one another quite well. The goal of the pronunciation scheme is to provide the stu- dent with one acceptable model of pronunciation for each entry. Where the numbered senses of an entry are all pro- nounced the same way, the phonetic representation follows the main entry word. In entries where even one of the numbered senses is pronounced differently from the rest, all the senses are provided with a phonetic representation. Sounds represented here as [ or ] are often pronounced as [ Or ] in some parts of the East. Similarly, the sequence [ Er ] is often pronounced [ Ar ] in parts of the East. One heavy stress is marked for each word. The dictionary user should expect to hear variation in the pronunciation of most of the words listed in this or any dictionary, but should remain confident that the model provided here is understood and accepted in all parts of the country.
