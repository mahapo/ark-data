TED HAD NOTHING BUT GOOD THINGSTO SAY ABOUT TERI, AND INSTINCTIVELY I KNEW THAT THE BOOK MUST BE WORTHWHILE.TED WONG HAS BEEN A FAMILY FRIEND AND STUDENT OF JKD SINCE BEFORE I WAS BORN. HEIS MY SIFU, AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE PRESERVATION AND TRUTH OF MY FATHER’S ART,THERE IS NO ONE BETTER—NO ONE MORE DEDICATED, KNOWLEDGEABLE, OR THOUGHTFUL. HEIS NOT DRIVEN BY FAME OR FORTUNE OR ACCOLADES. HE IS SIMPLY AN UNFETTERED SOULWITH A PURE HEART, A CLEAR MIND, AND A STEADY BODY. IF HE SAYS SOMETHING ISGOOD, I KNOW I CAN TRUST THAT.AFTER OUR FIRST CONVERSATION ABOUT THE BOOK, TED PRESENTED ME WITH SOME SAMPLECHAPTERS AND INFORMATION ABOUT TERI. AFTER READING HER SAMPLE PAGES (ANDULTIMATELY THE ENTIRE MANUSCRIPT), I WAS IMPRESSED. TERI’S ABILITY TO DELIVERTHE INFORMATION CLEARLY AND CONCISELY WAS INSTANTLY GRATIFYING. THE DEPTH OF HERRESEARCH IS REMARKABLE AND HER INSIGHT INTO THE SUBJECT MATTER SOUND. I KNEWRIGHT AWAY THAT HER GRASP WAS SOLID AND THAT SHE WAS, OF COURSE, A STUDENT OFTED’S. READING HER WORDS HAS DONE MY HEART A LOT OF GOOD. I AM GRATEFUL FOR HERWRITING ABILITY. THE TEXT IS FLUID AND WELL STRUCTURED. IT IS A PLEASURE TOREAD. TERI’S RESEARCH ACTS AS A SOLID BASE UPON WHICH HER INSTRUCTION IN JKD CANSTAND FIRMLY AND SECURELY. HER SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATIONS ARE PURE AND PERFECTLYJUN FAN JEET KUNE DO. I AM DELIGHTED.OVER THE YEARS, A LOT OF DAMAGE HAS BEEN DONE TO BRUCE LEE’S ART OF JEET KUNEDO. MANY PEOPLE HAVE DONE THE ART A DISSERVICE BECAUSE THEY DO NOT TRULYUNDERSTAND IT. JKD IS A SCIENTIFIC, PHYSICAL, AND PHILOSOPHICAL ART OFINDIVIDUAL COMBATIVE EXPRESSION THAT IS, ABOVE ALL THINGS, SIMPLE AND DIRECT.THAT BEARS REPEATING: SIMPLE AND DIRECT. JKD IS NOT AN AMALGAMATION OF MANYDIFFERENT ARTS. IT IS NOT MIXED MARTIAL ARTS. IT IS NOT AN ACCUMULATION OFWEAPONS, BUT RATHER A PARING DOWN AND A FOCUSING. TO BECOME SENTIENT IN YOURMARTIAL WAYS—TO SPRING OUT OF THE VOID AND RETURN TO THE VOID WITH FEROCITY ANDCOLLECTEDNESS—TAKES YEARS OF HONING YOUR SKILLS, NOT THE ACCUMULATION OF ANOVERLOADED ARSENAL. FURTHER, JKD IS NOT A PHILOSOPHY DEVOID OF TECHNIQUE. ONECANNOT DIVORCE THE SCIENCE FROM THE PHILOSOPHY OR DIVORCE THE TECHNIQUES FROMTHE PRINCIPLES. THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF EGREGIOUS MISREPRESENTATION AND TOO MUCHMISINTERPRETATION. AND SO, A BOOK SUCH AS TERI’S THAT IS DESIGNED TO SHED A TRUELIGHT ON MANY IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF JKD, IN PARTICULAR THE STRAIGHT LEAD, FILLSME WITH HOPE AND INSPIRATION. THIS IS A BOOK THAT MAKES AN EFFORT TO PRESENT ITSMATERIAL FULLY AND DECISIVELY, AND SUCCEEDS IN DOING SO. FOR THIS I AM GRATEFUL.IN THE MONTHS TO COME, BRUCE LEE’S IMMEDIATE FAMILY WILL BE WORKING TO FULLYLAUNCH ITS NONPROFIT BRUCE LEE FOUNDATION FOR THE PRESERVATION AND PROLIFERATIONOF BRUCE LEE’S LEGACY, PHILOSOPHY, AND ART. THIS ART WE NOW CALL (AS DOES TERION THE COVER OF HER BOOK) JUN FAN JEET KUNE DO, AS A WAY TO MORE SPECIFICALLYDELINEATE IT AS THE AUTHENTIC ART OF BRUCE LEE AS HE TAUGHT IT IN HIS LIFETIME.1IN THE NEAR FUTURE, ANYONE SEEKING INSTRUCTION WILL BE ABLE TO FIND SOLIDINFORMATION AND REFERRALS ON OUR WEB SITE (WWW.BRUCELEEFOUNDATION.COM[http://www.bruceleefoundation.com]).

THAT WASN’T AN UNUSUAL THOUGHT FOR ME WHEN SPARRING WITHBRUCE LEE. THIS PUNCH WAS ELEMENTAL, POWERFUL, AND FAST—VERY FAST. IT WAS THESTRAIGHT LEAD, A PUNCH ABSOLUTELY BASIC TO LEE’S CONTEMPORARY MARTIAL ART, JEETKUNE DO—OR AS HE REFERRED TO IT, SCIENTIFIC STREET FIGHTING.JKD’S DISCIPLINE IS ONE OF SPECIFICS, THE FOUNDATION OF WHICH BRUCE LEEDEVELOPED NOT ONLY BY DECONSTRUCTING EASTERN MARTIAL ARTS, BUT ALSO BY EXPLORINGTHE HISTORY OF WESTERN BOXING AND FENCING. HE SCOURED HUNDREDS OF BOOKS ON THESCIENCE OF COMBAT, THE LAWS OF PHYSICS, AND THE STYLES OF WESTERN FIGHTING. THEDEPTH AND INTENSITY OF HIS STUDY CAN BE WITNESSED IN THE COPIOUS NOTES, THEUNDERLINED PASSAGES, AND THE WEAR AND TEAR OF THE BOOKS THAT WERE HIS SPECIALSOURCES OF INSPIRATION. IN DISCOVERING THE STRAIGHT LEAD, LEE FOUND A PUNCH TOSERVE AS A KEYSTONE TO HIS FIGHTING FORM. AND HE FOUND THE STRAIGHT LEAD’SIMPRESSIVE EFFECTIVENESS DESCRIBED, MOST NOTABLY, IN THE WRITINGS OF BOXERS JACKDEMPSEY AND JIM DRISCOLL, AND FENCER ALDO NADI.THE ART OF FENCING HELD A PARTICULAR RESONANCE FOR LEE. THE STRAIGHT LEAD’SEXTENSION OF THE ARM IN A SWIFT, DIRECT MOVEMENT OPERATED AS A LINE OF ATTACKCOMPARABLE TO FENCING’S STRAIGHT THRUST— WESTERN SWORD FENCING, WITHOUT THESWORD, WAS HOW LEE DESCRIBED IT. BOTH MOVES CONVEY THE ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLE OFHIS FIGHTING FORM—THE PRINCIPLE OF INTERCEPTION. JEET KUNE DO, MEANING “THE WAYOF THE INTERCEPTING FIST,” IS A PERFECTED SYNTHESIS OF WESTERN FIGHTINGELEMENTS—AND A DISCIPLINE THAT HAS IMPACTED ALL OF MARTIAL ARTS.LEE ONCE ASKED ME WHAT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN A FIGHT. WHEN, AFTER ADOZEN TRIES, I STILL HADN’T FOUND THE ANSWER, HE TOLD ME IT WAS ADAPTABILITY—THEABILITY TO ADJUST, TO FIND YOUR FEET WHEN CONFRONTED WITH CHANGING SITUATIONS.HE EXPLAINED THAT THE TRADITIONAL MARTIAL ARTS, AT WHICH HE WAS ADEPT, HADBECOME LOST IN THEIR TRADITIONS—TRADITIONS THAT PROVED TOO ELABORATE, TOOAWKWARD, TOO SLOW WHEN EXECUTED IN REAL FIGHTING SITUATIONS. LEE ADAPTED. HESPENT YEARS EXPERIMENTING. WHEN HE FOUND AN APPROACH HE LIKED, HE SUBMITTED ITTO AN EMPIRICAL TEST—HE’D FIND OUT IF A PUNCH OR KICK WORKED BY DOING IT. IF ITDIDN’T OPERATE PROPERLY, HE WOULD TRY AGAIN UNTIL ALL OF IT WAS RIGHT—THEINTENT, THE MECHANICS, AND THE SPEED AT WHICH IT ALL COMES TOGETHER. THEDEFINING AND REFINING OF JKD EVOLVED OVER TIME THROUGH LEE’S RIGOROUSEXAMINATION AND PHYSICAL EFFORT. IT REPRESENTS BRUCE LEE’S LASTING LEGACY. TOHONOR THIS LEGACY, JKD MUST BE TAUGHT AND LEARNT THE RIGHT WAY —NOT ANY OLD WAY.[../Images/14a.jpg]FIGURE 1: TED WONG ON THE RECEIVING END OF A STRAIGHT LEAD THROWN BY THE MASTERHIMSELF. (© LINDA LEE CADWELL)AN INSPIRING TEACHER, LEE NEVER FORCED STUDENTS TO LEARN MORE THAN THEY COULDHANDLE. HE TAUGHT IN STAGES, ENCOURAGING EACH STUDENT TO UNDERSTAND AND ABSORBAT HIS OR HER OWN PACE. BY ACCEPTING ONLY A SMALL NUMBER OF STUDENTS, LEE SOUGHTTO GRADUALLY IMPART HIS ART, AN ART THAT WAS NEW AND REVOLUTIONARY FOR ITSTIME—ONE THAT COULD EASILY BE MISINTERPRETED OR SLOPPILY EXECUTED IF NOTCULTIVATED IN THE PROPER WAY. AS A STUDENT AND FRIEND OF BRUCE LEE, AND AS ATEACHER OF JKD FOR SOME THIRTY-FIVE YEARS, I CONTINUE TO ADMIRE THE REALISM,EFFECTIVENESS, AND PHYSICAL AND INTELLECTUAL BEAUTY OF HIS FIGHTING SYSTEM.LEE WAS AN EXTREMELY PRECISE PERSON. IN EVERYTHING HE DID HE PAID ATTENTION,ALMOST OBSESSIVELY, TO DETAIL. THERE’S NO QUESTION THAT HE SAW THE BIG PICTUREIN RELATION TO JKD— WHAT IT REPRESENTED, AND WHAT IT DELINEATED. THIS IS EVIDENTIN HIS WRITING, IN HIS SPEAKING, AND IN THE WAY HE PRESENTED HIMSELF TO THEWORLD. BUT AS WITH ANYTHING NEW AND ORIGINAL, IMITATORS AND PRETENDERS TO THETHRONE ARE RIFE. WITHOUT BRUCE LEE HERE TO COMBAT THEM, THE INTEGRITY OF JKD HASBEEN UNDERMINED OVER TIME.I CHOOSE NOT TO FORGET WHAT IS GENUINE AND TRUE TO BRUCE LEE’S LEGACY—WHAT I WASTAUGHT. WHAT HAS BEEN NEEDED, FOR YEARS, IS A CLEAR-CUT APPROACH THAT CANRECTIFY AND CORRECT THE MUDDLED INTERPRETATION AND UNNECESSARY ADDITIONS TO JKD.A STEP IN THAT DIRECTION IS OFFERED HERE BY TERI TOM WHO, WITH EXACTING CARE,LAYS OUT THE STRAIGHT LEAD—WHERE THE PUNCH CAME FROM, HOW IT OPERATES, AND HOWIT’S CONNECTED TO THE HEART AND SOUL OF JKD. SHE BACKS UP HER INSTRUCTION WITHEXTENSIVE RESEARCH THAT PARALLELS LEE’S OWN.TERI TOM APPROACHED ME ALMOST SEVEN YEARS AGO FOR LESSONS IN JKD. A SLIGHT YOUNGWOMAN WITH NO PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF MARTIAL ARTS, TERI POSED A CHALLENGE. BUT IBELIEVED THAT WITH PROPER INSTRUCTION, THE PRINCIPLES OF LEE’S SYSTEM COULD WORKFOR HER. AT EACH STEP OF THE LEARNING PROCESS, TERI SURPRISED ME AGAIN ANDAGAIN, WITH HER COMMITTED RESOLVE AND PERCEPTIVE APPLICATION OF THE DISCIPLINE.SHE HAS BEEN A DEDICATED STUDENT, LOGGING IN OVER ONE THOUSAND HOURS OFINSTRUCTION, AS WELL AS MANY MORE HOURS OF SPARRING. AND IN THOSE HOURS OFSPARRING, SHE HAS DEVELOPED A PICTURE-PERFECT STRAIGHT LEAD. TRUTHFULLY, I HAVENOT SEEN ANYONE ELSE—WITH THE EXCEPTION OF BRUCE LEE, THAT IS—THROW A LEAD PUNCHTHAT IS AS FUNDAMENTALLY SOUND AND TECHNICALLY REFINED. SHE’S A NATURAL STRAIGHTSHOOTER WITH BOTH THE FRONT AND REAR HAND. SHE ALSO HAPPENS TO PACK A MEAN RIGHTHOOK. WHAT SHE MAY LACK IN PHYSICAL STRENGTH AND SIZE, SHE MAKES UP IN TECHNICALKNOW-HOW.TERI’S PHYSICAL PROWESS IS MATCHED BY AN INTELLECTUAL STRENGTH. SHOWING ASINCERE CURIOSITY ABOUT THE ORIGINS OF JKD, SHE READ AND ABSORBED THE PUBLISHEDWORKS OF BRUCE LEE AND THE AUTHORS WHO INSPIRED HIM. WHEN SHE PROPOSED A BOOK ONTHE STRAIGHT LEAD PUNCH, I ENCOURAGED HER TO TAKE UP THE TASK. I GAVE HER ACCESSTO MY OWN ARCHIVE OF BRUCE LEE MATERIALS, WHICH INCLUDES PHOTOCOPIES OF MANYRARE BOOKS AND NOTES FROM LEE’S OWN LIBRARY—ALL HIGHLIGHTED AND ANNOTATED BY LEEHIMSELF. USING THIS MATERIAL HAS ALLOWED TERI TO SEE HOW HE CAME TO THECONCLUSIONS HE DID REGARDING WESTERN BOXING AND FENCING, AND WHAT ASPECTS HECHOSE TO INTEGRATE INTO HIS UNIQUE FIGHTING SYSTEM.IN RETRACING LEE’S FOOTSTEPS, TERI IS THOUGHTFUL AND CLEAR IN HER WORDS.ALTOGETHER, SHE PRESENTS A TRULY ACCURATE PERSPECTIVE ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESTRAIGHT LEAD, AND A TRULY MEANINGFUL CONTRIBUTION TO THE STUDY AND APPRECIATIONOF JEET KUNE DO AND THE MAN WHO CREATED IT, BRUCE LEE.—TED WONG, OCTOBER 2004"},{"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N[../Images/1.jpg][../Images/16a.jpg]“T H E C O R E O F J E E T K U N E D O”IT MAY SEEM A BIT EXCESSIVE TO DEVOTE AN ENTIRE BOOK TO A SINGLE PUNCH, BUT ASBRUCE LEE HIMSELF DECLARED, “THE STRAIGHT PUNCH IS THE CORE OF JEET KUNE DO.”1TO WRITE A BOOK ON THE JEET KUNE DO STRAIGHT LEAD, THEN, IS TO WRITE A BOOK ONTHE MOST BASIC, FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF JKD. IN FACT, THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE OFTHE ART WAS DESIGNED AROUND THE MOST EFFICIENT AND FORCEFUL DELIVERY OF THESTRAIGHT PUNCH. STRATEGICALLY, YOU MUST HAVE A STRONG LEAD HAND FOR BOTH OFFENSEAND DEFENSE. OTHER WEAPONS—HOOK PUNCHES, REAR CROSSES, UPPERCUTS, AND KICKS—AREOF LITTLE USE WITHOUT A GOOD LEAD HAND TO SET THEM UP.THE CULMINATION OF YEARS OF SCIENTIFIC STUDY, THE STRAIGHT LEAD IS ABIOMECHANICAL MARVEL MAXIMIZING THE POTENTIAL FOR LEVERAGE, ACCURACY,ACCELERATION, AND FORCE PRODUCTION. ONCE YOU HAVE GRASPED THE MECHANICALPRINCIPLES BEHIND THE STRAIGHT LEAD, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO LEARN OTHER JKD PUNCHESAND KICKS WITH GREATER EASE.N O M Y S T I Q U EBY BRUCE LEE’S OWN ADMISSION, THOUGH, THE STRAIGHT LEAD IS THE MOST DIFFICULTTECHNIQUE IN THE JEET KUNE DO ARSENAL, AND OF THE ART ITSELF, HE SAID, “ONLY ONEOF 10,000 CAN HANDLE IT. IT IS MARTIAL ART. COMPLETE OFFENSIVE ATTACKS. IT ISSILLY TO THINK ALMOST ANYONE CAN LEARN IT.”2 AND AS TED WONG HAS SAID OFSTRAIGHT PUNCHING, “IF IT WERE EASY, EVERYONE WOULD BE DOING IT.”3HOWEVER, THE EXCLUSIVITY OF JKD HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH EXOTIC, ANCIENT HOODOOVOODOO. THERE ARE NO MYSTERIOUS SECRETS STEEPED IN MYTHOLOGY OR RIGIDCLASSICISM. NO, THESE ARE THE VERY THINGS BRUCE REBELLED AGAINST. IF ANYTHING,JEET KUNE DO LAID EVERYTHING ABOUT THE MARTIAL ARTS OUT IN THE OPEN. INSTEAD OFBEING SHROUDED IN MYSTERY, ITS PRINCIPLES ARE ROOTED IN THE SCIENCES OFBIOMECHANICS, PHYSICS, AND FENCING STRATEGY.THE SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES BEHIND JKD ARE NOT DIFFICULT TO GRASP, NOR IS THEPHYSICAL CONDITIONING REQUIRED TO PRACTICE IT PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE.WHAT MAKES JEET KUNE DO AND THE STRAIGHT LEAD SO CHALLENGING IS THE PATIENCENEEDED TO TAKE A FEW SIMPLE TECHNIQUES AND STAY WITH THEM—THE PERSEVERANCE TOREFINE, REFINE, REFINE, KNOWING THAT YOU WILL NEVER ACHIEVE TRUE PERFECTION.EVEN SO, THE PROBLEM IS NOT NECESSARILY THAT PEOPLE LACK DISCIPLINE. IN MANYCASES, THEY JUST HAVEN’T BEEN GIVEN THE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION TO CONVINCE THEMTO STICK IT OUT.IN WRITING THIS BOOK, THEN, I AM STATING THE CASE FOR SIMPLICITY AND REFINEMENT.EVERYTHING PRESENTED HERE STARTS WITH BRUCE LEE, AND WHERE POSSIBLE, I HAVEREFERENCED HIS PUBLISHED WORK. BECAUSE OF BRUCE’S UNTIMELY DEATH, HOWEVER, HENEVER LEFT US WITH A COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE TO THE STRAIGHT LEAD, SO WHEREVER ICOULD, I HAVE TRACED BRUCE’S WRITINGS TO THEIR ORIGINAL SOURCES IN THE WORKS OFALDO NADI, JACK DEMPSEY, JIM DRISCOLL, EDWIN HAISLET, ROGER CROSNIER, AND JULIOMARTINEZ CASTELLO. ALL OTHER MATERIAL APPEARING IN THIS VOLUME IS WHAT I HAVELEARNED DIRECTLY FROM TED WONG.4THE PURPOSE OF THIS SOMEWHAT ACADEMIC APPROACH IS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT JEET KUNEDO IS NOT A MERE SMORGASBORD OF STYLES. IT IS TRUE THAT BRUCE WAS HEAVILYINFLUENCED BY WESTERN BOXING AND FENCING, AND, YES, HE INCORPORATED SOMEGRAPPLING TECHNIQUES INTO HIS SYSTEM. BUT HE DID NOT HAPHAZARDLY THROW STYLESTOGETHER, AS SOME WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE. NO, JEET KUNE DO IS ITS OWN SYSTEM,WITH ITS OWN SET OF CAREFULLY RESEARCHED AND HONED TECHNIQUES. AS YOU WILL SEETHROUGHOUT THIS BOOK, THOSE THINGS BRUCE CHOSE TO INCORPORATE EVOLVED FROM AHISTORY OF FIGHTING SCIENCE THAT DATES BACK THOUSANDS OF YEARS.YOU WILL ALSO NOTICE THAT BRUCE DID NOT CHOOSE EVERYTHING. HE WENT WITH THETHUMBS-UP-POWER-LINE PUNCH OVER THE MORE MODERN BOXING JAB, THE REBELLIOUSCOCKED LEFT HEEL OVER THE ORTHODOX GROUNDED HEEL, THE RAPIER OVER THEBROADSWORD. THERE WERE REASONS BEHIND THESE CHOICES. IT IS THE AIM OF THISVOLUME TO REVEAL THOSE REASONS.T H E R O O T S O F J K DNO TECHNICAL JEET KUNE DO BOOK WOULD BE COMPLETE WITHOUT FIRST LOOKING AT WHATBRUCE CALLED THE ROOTS OF JKD. THEY ARE:1.

REMEMBER THE ROOTS, FOR THEY ARE THE FOUNDATION OF ALL JKDTECHNIQUES—NOT JUST THE STRAIGHT LEAD—AND THEY ARE THE GUIDING PRINCIPLES OFTHIS BOOK. WHEN WE SPEAK OF SIMPLICITY AND REFINEMENT, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THEROOTS. WHEN YOU ARE LOST, CONFUSED, OR UNSURE OF YOUR TECHNIQUE, GO BACK TOTHEM. THEY ARE YOUR ROADMAP.A F E W W O R D S O F E N C O U R A G E M E N T STRAIGHT HITTING IS NO SIMPLE TASK. BRUCE SAID SO, AS DID ALL HIS MAJOR BOXINGINFLUENCES— EDWIN HAISLET, JIM DRISCOLL, AND JACK DEMPSEY. “THE ABILITY TO HITSTRAIGHT FROM THE SHOULDER IS NOT A NATURAL ACT,” WROTE HAISLET. “IT CANNOT BELEARNED BY CHANCE AND EXPERIENCE DOES NOT TEACH IT. STRAIGHT HITTING, WITH BODYBEHIND EACH BLOW, IS AN ART THAT TAKES YEARS OF STUDY AND PRACTICE TO PERFECT.”6YEARS. YOU DO NOT LEARN THE STRAIGHT LEAD OVERNIGHT. BEGINNERS OFTEN TRY IT FORA FEW WEEKS, BECOME DISCOURAGED BY THEIR LACK OF POWER, AND GIVE UP, REVERTINGTO THEIR OLD WAYS. THEY LATER WONDER WHY THEIR PROGRESS PLATEAUS, BUT AS THESAYING GOES, THE DEFINITION OF INSANITY IS REPEATING THE SAME ACTION, OVER ANDOVER, EXPECTING DIFFERENT RESULTS. LEARNING THE STRAIGHT LEAD MAY REQUIRE YOU TOSTEP OUT OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE FOR A LITTLE WHILE.YES, SWINGING PUNCHES LOOK SPECTACULAR. YES, THAT MODERN BOXING JAB FEELS MORENATURAL. BUT AS YOU’LL SOON SEE, THERE’S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NATURAL ANDSCIENTIFICALLY EFFECTIVE. WITH THIS VOLUME, I HOPE TO PRESENT ENOUGH SCIENTIFICEVIDENCE AND STRATEGIC ARGUMENTS TO CONVINCE YOU TO STICK WITH THE STRAIGHTLEAD. WEIGH THE EVIDENCE YOURSELF. AS YOU PROGRESS THROUGH THE VARIOUS STAGES OFLEARNING—FROM AWKWARD BABY STEPS OF NEUROMUSCULAR PROGRAMMING TO THE ADVANCEDSTAGES OF COMBATIVE APPLICATION—I ASK THAT YOU TAKE A SMALL LEAP OF FAITH. TRUSTIN THE INSTRUCTION PRESENTED HERE. STAY WITH IT. THE SECRETS THAT ARE HIDDEN NOWWILL SOMEDAY REVEAL THEMSELVES TO YOU.FINALLY, GIVEN THAT WE LIVE IN A FAST-PACED WORLD OF INSTANT GRATIFICATION, IT’SEASY TO SEE WHY STRAIGHT PUNCHING, WHICH TAKES YEARS TO CULTIVATE, HAS BECOMESOMETHING OF A LOST ART. IT’S NICE TO KNOW, HOWEVER, THAT THERE ARE STILL SOMETHINGS THAT MONEY CANNOT BUY. THE STRAIGHT LEAD IS ONE OF THEM. THERE IS JUST NOSUBSTITUTE FOR TIME INVESTED IN ANY ENDEAVOR—FOR PATIENCE, HARD WORK,EXPERIENCE, SWEAT, AND, IN THIS CASE, PROBABLY A LITTLE BLOOD! SO WHILE OTHERARTS MAY FOCUS ON THE ACCUMULATION OF ENDLESS TECHNIQUES, MAY STRESS THE FLASHYOVER THE EFFICIENT, OR EVEN ALLOW THE BUYING OF BELTS, REMEMBER THAT YOU ARE ONA DIFFERENT PATH. STAY ON IT. USE THE ROOTS AS YOUR ROADMAP, AND THE REWARDSWILL PAY OFF BIG, IN WAYS YOU CANNOT IMAGINE.AT TIMES YOU MAY BE DISCOURAGED, AS OTHERS ON THE QUICK AND EASY ROAD SEEM TOPASS YOU BY. YOU MAY BE TEMPTED TO FOLLOW THE CROWD. TO THIS, I OFFER THEFOLLOWING FROM JACK DEMPSEY:> LET ME EMPHASIZE AGAIN THAT YOU WILL FEEL VERY AWKWARD WHEN YOU FIRST TRY THE> MOVES IN LONG-RANGE PUNCHING. I STRESS THAT AWKWARDNESS FOR TWO REASONS: (1)> SO THAT YOU WON’T FIGURE YOU’RE A HOPELESS PALOOKA, AND (2) SO THAT YOU’LL PAY> NO ATTENTION TO WISECRACKS OF FRIENDS OR SIDELINE EXPERTS WHO WATCH YOUR EARLY> FLOUNDERINGS. REMEMBER: HE LAUGHS LAST WHO HITS HARDEST.7IN THE SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY MARTIAL ARTS CLASSIC THE UNFETTERED MIND —A BOOK, BYTHE WAY, THAT RESIDES IN BRUCE LEE’S PERSONAL LIBRARY—TAKUAN SOHO HAD A SIMILARMESSAGE:> IF YOU FOLLOW THE PRESENT DAY WORLD, YOU WILL TURN YOUR BACK ON THE WAY; IF> YOU WOULD NOT TURN YOUR BACK ON THE WAY, DO NOT FOLLOW THE WORLD.8SO WITH THESE WORDS IN MIND, LET’S BEGIN OUR EXPLORATION OF THE JEET KUNE DOSTRAIGHT LEAD.[../Images/2.jpg]N O T E S1 BRUCE LEE, ED.

IN1964, BRUCE LEE WROTE, “THE ART OF STRAIGHT HITTING (PUNCHING IN A STRAIGHT ANDDIRECT LINE) IS THE FOUNDATION OF SCIENTIFIC SKILL. IT IS THE END RESULT OFTHOUSANDS OF YEARS OF CAREFUL ANALYSIS AND THOUGHT.”1 INDEED, THE STRAIGHT PUNCHIS NOT SOMETHING THAT “JUST HAPPENS.” ITS ORIGINS CAN BE TRACED TO THEPRE-OLYMPIC ERA (1500 TO 1000 B. C.).JUDGING FROM ARTWORK AND PICTURES, IT IS BELIEVED THAT BLOWS WERE ORIGINALLYDELIVERED BY SWINGING AND HOOKING. THIS IS A PRIMITIVE FIGHTING METHOD AND ISACTUALLY OBSERVED IN BEARS AND CATS—HENCE, JIM DRISCOLL’S REFERENCE TO SWINGING,UNEDUCATED FIGHTERS AS “BEAR-CATS.”2 IMAGES FROM MINOAN AND GREEK VASES,FRIEZES, AND STATUES FROM THE PRE-OLYMPIC ERA PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT THE GREEKSWERE STARTING TO UTILIZE THE LEFT, OR LEAD, HAND. THE POSITION OF THE LEAD HANDIN THESE PICTURES SUGGESTS THE DEVELOPMENT OF STRAIGHT PUNCHING.THE CAESTUS, THE ORIGINAL BOXING GLOVE, PROVIDES FURTHER EVIDENCE OF STRAIGHTPUNCHING. THE CAESTUS WAS REALLY NOTHING MORE THAN A LEATHER HAND WRAP, WHICHCOVERED ALMOST THE SAME AREAS THAT ITS MODERN-DAY COTTON DESCENDANT DOES. INPARTICULAR, THE CAESTUS PROVIDED PROTECTION OVER ALL FOUR FINGERS, BETWEEN THESECOND JOINT AND KNUCKLE, THE HITTING SURFACE OF STRAIGHT PUNCHES.3HAND PROTECTION FOR STRAIGHT HITTERS WAS LATER REINFORCED DURING THE OLYMPICPERIOD WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF THE “HARD GLOVE,” A THICK LEATHER GLOVE THAT,AGAIN, COVERED THE FOUR FINGERS BETWEEN THE SECOND JOINT AND KNUCKLE, THESURFACE OF ALL STRAIGHT HITTING. EVEN THOUGH FIGHTERS OF THIS ERA WERE STILLSWINGING, THE HARD GLOVE’S HITTING SURFACE IS EVIDENCE THAT THOSE SWINGS WERENOW SHORTENING INTO MORE SCIENTIFIC HOOKS.ALONG WITH THE PROMINENCE OF STRAIGHT HITTING CAME THE BOXING STANCE THAT VERYMUCH RESEMBLES THE MODERN BOXING STANCE. IN GREEK ARTWORK DEPICTING BOXINGSCENES, THE LEFT (LEAD) FOOT IS CLEARLY IN FRONT OF THE RIGHT FOOT, WITH THELEFT HAND HELD STRAIGHT OUT. EVEN THEN, THE LEFT HAND WAS USED AS A DEFENSIVETOOL TO FEND OFF OPPONENTS WITH PESTERING JABS, FROM A STANCE THAT GUARDED THECENTERLINE. THE GREEKS PROBABLY USED THE LEAD HAND AS A GAUGE FOR JUDGINGDISTANCE AS WELL.4WHATEVER PROGRESS THE GREEKS HAD MADE, HOWEVER, WAS SOON LOST WHEN THE ROMANSINTRODUCED THE LEAD-LOADED CAESTUS, WHICH WAS QUITE EFFECTIVE AT SMASHINGSKULLS, ENDING MATCHES SWIFTLY AND SPECTACULARLY, REGARDLESS OF THE CONTESTANTS’SKILL. FOLLOWING IN THE VEIN OF THE LOADED CAESTUS WAS THE MYRMEX, A PICKATTACHED TO THE CAESTUS, INTENDED TO PIERCE BODY PARTS—NASTY, NASTY BUSINESS.BOTH WEAPONS MAY BE BLAMED FOR THE LOSS OF FISTIC ART AND SCIENCE. IN ASITUATION NOT UNLIKE THE ONE WE FACE TODAY, THE DESIRE FOR BLOODY ENTERTAINMENTHAD BROUGHT FIGHTING TO ITS LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR.IT WOULD TAKE 1200 YEARS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF FENCING FOR BOXING TO REEMERGE.AS JOHN V. GROMBACH WROTE IN THE SAGA OF THE FIST:> WHEN BOXING DID COME BACK IN ENGLAND, IT WAS INTRODUCED BY FENCING-MASTERS. AS> A RESULT, THE BOXING STANCE WAS MADE TO APPROXIMATE THE FENCING STANCE AND TO> GOOD EFFECT. BY THAT TIME, FENCING HAD ADVANCED TO THE POINT WHERE THE SMALL> SWORD OR THRUSTING WEAPON WAS PREFERRED TO THE BROADSWORD OR SABRE. THE USE OF> THE STRAIGHT THRUST OR LUNGE AGAINST ANY SIDE SWEEP OR SLASH HAD BEEN> DEVELOPED. THE PRINCIPLES OF ADVANCING, RETREATING, MUCH OF OUR MODERN BOXING> FOOTWORK, AND OUR STRAIGHT PUNCHING CAME FROM FENCING.5THE RAPIER WAS THE WEAPON THAT ESTABLISHED THE SUPREMACY OF STRAIGHT THRUSTINGOVER SLASHING.6 FIRST, THE RAPIER, WITH ITS PINPOINT ACCURACY, WAS MUCH MOREEFFECTIVE THAN THE BROADSWORD IN FINDING THOSE VULNERABLE LITTLE AREAS BETWEENPLATES OF ARMOR. BUT THE MAIN ADVANTAGE OF THE RAPIER OVER THE BROADSWORD ISTHAT THE SHORTEST DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO POINTS IS A STRAIGHT LINE. APPLIED TOFENCING OR BOXING, A STRAIGHT THRUST OR STRAIGHT LEAD WILL REACH ITS TARGETBEFORE A SWING, HOOK, OR SWEEPING SLASH. STRAIGHT MOTIONS IN FIGHTING ARE,THEREFORE, NOT ONLY OFFENSIVE MANEUVERS, BUT DEFENSIVE IN NATURE AS WELL.THIS IS WHAT WE CALL THE “STOP-HIT” IN FENCING. AS NADI NOTED, “THE GREATADVANTAGE OF THE STOP-THRUST OVER THE COUNTERATTACK-PROPER IS THAT IT CAN BEPERFORMED AGAINST FAST, CORRECTLY EXECUTED ATTACKS—STOPPING THEM IN THEIRTRACKS.”7 THE STOP-HIT, EXECUTED MAINLY WITH THE STRAIGHT LEAD, IS SUCH ANIMPORTANT PRINCIPLE OF JEET KUNE DO THAT THIS IS WHERE BRUCE LEE’S ART DERIVESITS VERY NAME. IN CANTONESE, JEET MEANS “INTERCEPTING” OR “STOPPING,” KUNE MEANS“FIST,” AND DO IS “THE WAY.” TRANSLATED IN ENGLISH, JEET KUNE DO IS QUITELITERALLY “THE WAY OF THE INTERCEPTING FIST.”[../Images/2.jpg]N O T E S1 BRUCE LEE, ED.

IN 1964, BRUCE WAS TEACHING MARTIAL ARTS ATHIS OAKLAND SCHOOL. OTHER BAY AREA KUNG FU INSTRUCTORS, DISPLEASED WITH BRUCE’SWILLINGNESS TO TAKE ON NON-CHINESE STUDENTS, DISPATCHED WONG J. MAN FROM HONGKONG TO OAKLAND WITH AN ULTIMATUM: CLOSE THE SCHOOL OR THROW DOWN.THE CHALLENGE, OF COURSE, WAS MET RIGHT THERE ON THE SPOT, AND THE TWO FACEDOFF, BUT A FIGHT THAT BRUCE FELT SHOULD HAVE BEEN OVER MUCH SOONER LASTED ANEXCRUCIATING THREE MINUTES.1 BRUCE HADN’T TRAINED TO DEAL WITH SOMEONE WHO RAN.AFTER THE FIGHT, HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IF HE’D KNOWN SOME WESTERNBOXING, HE WOULD HAVE DISPENSED WITH HIS OPPONENT MUCH SOONER.2WHILE IT’S TRUE THAT BRUCE ORIGINALLY STUDIED AND TAUGHT THE CLASSICAL CHINESEART OF WING CHUN, IT IS NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH JEET KUNE DO. IN A LETTER TOWILLIAM CHEUNG, DATED JANUARY 4, 1969, BRUCE ADMITTED TO HAVING VIRTUALLYABANDONED WING CHUN:> WILLIAM, I’VE LOST FAITH IN THE CHINESE CLASSICAL ARTS—THOUGH I STILL CALL> MINE CHINESE—BECAUSE BASICALLY ALL STYLES ARE PRODUCTS OF LAND SWIMMING, EVEN> THE WING CHUN SCHOOL. SO MY LINE OF TRAINING IS MORE TOWARD EFFICIENT STREET> FIGHTING WITH EVERYTHING GOES, WEARING HEAD GEAR, GLOVES, CHEST GUARD,> SHIN-KNEE GUARDS, ETC.

IN A LETTER TO JAMES LEE DATED JULY 31, 1965, BRUCE WROTE, “I’MHAVING A GUNG FU SYSTEM DRAWN UP—THIS SYSTEM IS A COMBINATION OF CHIEFLY WINGCHUN, FENCING AND BOXING.”4 BY 1969, HE HAD FOR THE MOST PART DROPPED WING CHUNAND THE CLASSICAL CHINESE ARTS. SOON AFTERWARD, HE WOULD BEGIN WRITING WHATWOULD EVENTUALLY BE PUBLISHED AS THE TAO OF JEET KUNE DO AND BRUCE LEE’SCOMMENTARIES ON THE MARTIAL WAY.BECAUSE OF BRUCE’S UNTIMELY DEATH, NEITHER VOLUME APPEARS IN A FORM HE WOULDHAVE INTENDED TO PUBLISH, BUT FROM THESE NOTES, WE CAN SEE THE HEAVY INFLUENCEOF BOXING AND FENCING. ENTIRE PASSAGES ARE QUOTED FROM BOXING SOURCES, MAINLYFROM JACK DEMPSEY AND EDWIN HAISLET, AND THE MAJOR ARGUMENTS FOR USING THESTRAIGHT LEAD CAN BE FOUND IN THE WRITINGS OF JIM DRISCOLL.1PEOPLE HAVE ASSUMED THAT BRUCE LEE TURNED TO FENCING BECAUSE HIS BROTHER WAS AFENCING CHAMPION IN HONG KONG, BUT THIS WAS PROBABLY NOT THE CASE. ACCORDING TOTED WONG, “PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY BRUCE LEE LOOKED INTO FENCING BECAUSE HIS BROTHER’SA FENCER. I DOUBT IT. THERE HAD TO HAVE BEEN SOME KIND OF WRITING THAT CONNECTEDBOXING TO FENCING. DRISCOLL MENTIONED THAT CONNECTION, AS DID HAISLET. I DOUBTTHAT THE MAIN INTEREST IN FENCING CAME BECAUSE OF HIS BROTHER.”6 AS YOU’LL SEETHROUGHOUT THIS BOOK, BRUCE MADE DIRECT REFERENCES TO DRISCOLL AND HAISLET THATCLEARLY EXPLAIN HOW STRAIGHT PUNCHING EVOLVED OUT OF FENCING. IN FACT, IT SEEMSTHAT AT ONE TIME IT WAS COMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT THE BRITISH HAD REVIVED BOXINGBECAUSE OF FENCING.7THE MOST FREQUENTLY CITED FENCING SOURCES IN THE TAO OF JEET KUNE DO COME FROMROGER CROSNIER, JULIO MARTINEZ CASTELLO, AND HUGO AND JAMES CASTELLO. BUT THECRUCIAL STANCE AND MECHANICAL NUANCES COME FROM ALDO NADI AND APPEAR IN BRUCELEE’S COMMENTARIES ON THE MARTIAL WAY. THE THREE MAJOR INFLUENCES ON THESTRAIGHT LEAD SPECIFICALLY ARE JIM DRISCOLL, JACK DEMPSEY, AND ALDO NADI.[../Images/2.jpg]A N G R Y Y O U N G M E NIF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT WITH THE STATUS QUO IS WHAT DROVE BRUCE LEE TO DEVELOPJEET KUNE DO, IT WAS PUGILISTIC REGRESSION THAT PROMPTED DRISCOLL AND DEMPSEY TOWRITE. BOTH AUTHORED BOOKS IN AN ATTEMPT TO PRESERVE THE DYING ART OF STRAIGHTPUNCHING. AND THOUGH NADI’S BOOK WAS FUELED BY HIS INTENSE LOVE OF FENCING, THATFEELING WAS MATCHED BY HIS UTTER DISGUST WITH THE FENCING PRACTICES OF HIS TIME.[../Images/28a.jpg]FIGURE 2: JIM DRISCOLL.P E E R L E S S J I MEARLY 1900S WELSH FEATHERWEIGHT CHAMPION JIM DRISCOLL AUTHORED A SERIES OFBOXING BOOKS, IN AN ATTEMPT TO RECTIFY THE PATHETIC STATE OF BRITISH BOXING.CHIEF AMONG THESE SLIM BUT HIGHLY ILLUMINATING VOLUMES IS THE STRAIGHT LEFT ANDHOW TO CULTIVATE IT —A BOOK THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY FIND ITS WAY INTO BRUCE LEE’SHANDS.DRISCOLL LAMENTED THE DECLINE OF BRITISH BOXING, WHICH HE BLAMED ON“CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE” THAT SUPPORTED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SWINGING PUNCHES.REMEMBER THAT PRIMAL SWINGING MOTIONS ARE OBSERVED IN BEARS AND CATS. DRISCOLLREFERRED TO UNEDUCATED FIGHTERS AS “BEAR-CATS.” IN AN UNFORTUNATE SET OFCIRCUMSTANCES, A SUCCESSION OF BEAR-CATS OUTWEIGHED AND OVERPOWERED A SERIES OFBRITISH BOXERS.IN PARTICULAR, DRISCOLL CITED THE RISE OF THE WILDLY SWINGING FRANK CRAIG, AKATHE COFFEE COOLER, AS THE REASON FOR THE “DECLINE AND FALL OF BRITISH BOXING.”BECAUSE SWINGS ARE EASIER TO SEE AND APPEAR TO HAVE MORE POWER BEHIND THEM,BRITISH SPECTATORS BELIEVED THEM TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE. DRISCOLL ARGUED THAT HADTHE COOLER MET AN EDUCATED FIGHTER, HE WOULD NOT HAVE FARED WELL, AND ALSO DRYLYPOINTED OUT THAT JUST BECAUSE THE COOLER CHEWED GUM WHILE FIGHTING, ASPIRINGFIGHTERS ADOPTED GUM CHEWING TO IMPROVE THEIR FIGHTING ABILITIES.FLYING IN THE FACE OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF FIGHTING SCIENCE, BEAR-CATS SUCH ASTHE COOLER LED THE PUBLIC TO THE WEAK CONCLUSION THAT SWINGING LIKE AN ANIMALWAS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN STRAIGHT HITTING. IN VERY LITTLE TIME, BRITISH FISTICSCIENCE BACKSLID CONSIDERABLY. DRISCOLL KNEW HE NEED LOOK NO FURTHER THAN THEDEVELOPMENT OF THE RAPIER TO ARGUE THE MERITS OF STRAIGHT PUNCHING.8IT IS MOST LIKELY THAT THIS IS WHERE BRUCE LEE GOT MANY OF HIS IDEAS FORAPPLYING THE FENCING STRAIGHT THRUST TO JEET KUNE DO. “IT’S WESTERN SWORDFENCING—WITHOUT THE SWORD,” HE USED TO SAY.9 THE SOURCE OF THAT PRINCIPLE WASJIM DRISCOLL, WHO WROTE:> AND THIS IS WHERE THE STRAIGHT LEFT COMES IN. NOT, AS IS USUALLY SUPPOSED,> MAINLY AS A MODE OF ATTACK, BUT RATHER AS A MORE EFFECTIVE AND VALUABLE MEANS> OF KEEPING AN OPPONENT AT A RESPECTFUL DISTANCE. I HAVE REMARKED ELSEWHERE> THAT THE SCIENCE OF MODERN BOXING AS INSTITUTED BY FIGG AND BROUGHTON WAS, AND> HAS ALWAYS REMAINED, A MATERIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE ART OF FENCING. IT IS> PRACTICALLY SWORD FENCING WITHOUT THE SWORD, AND FOLLOWS IN ALL ITS MOVEMENTS,> OR, RATHER, SHOULD FOLLOW, THE SAME PRINCIPLES.10COMPARE TO THE TAO OF JEET KUNE DO:> LIKE A FENCER’S SWORD THAT IS ALWAYS IN LINE, THE LEADING JAB IS A CONSTANT> THREAT TO YOUR OPPONENT. BASICALLY, IT IS WESTERN SWORD FENCING WITHOUT A> SWORD AND THE PRIMARY TARGET IS YOUR OPPONENT’S EYES.11DURING DRISCOLL’S TIME, AMERICAN BOXING HAD NOT YET DECLINED IN THE WAY BRITISHBOXING HAD, AND DRISCOLL CITED STRAIGHT SHOOTERS SUCH AS JACK DEMPSEY AS MODELFIGHTERS FOR THEIR STRAIGHT HITTING, WEIGHT TRANSFER, AND FOOTWORK.12T H E M A N A S S A M A U L E RIT WOULDN’T TAKE LONG, HOWEVER, FOR AMERICAN BOXING TO SUCCUMB TO THE EVILS OFCOMMERCIALIZATION. IN 1950, JACK DEMPSEY PUBLISHED CHAMPIONSHIP FIGHTING:EXPLOSIVE PUNCHING AND AGGRESSIVE DEFENCE IN AN ATTEMPT TO CORRECT A SITUATIONTHAT, IRONICALLY, HE HAD INADVERTENTLY HELPED CREATE WITH HIS HARD-HITTINGSTYLE. DEMPSEY EXPLAINED HOW HIS POPULARITY RESULTED IN A LOWEST COMMONDENOMINATOR APPROACH TO PUGILISM:> UNFORTUNATELY, MY BIG GATES DID MORE TO COMMERCIALIZE FIGHTING THAN ANYTHING> ELSE IN PUGILISTIC HISTORY. AS A COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE, THE FIGHT-GAME BEGAN> ATTRACTING PEOPLE WHO KNEW LITTLE OR NOTHING ABOUT SELF-DEFENCE. HOPING TO> MAKE QUICK MONEY, THEY FLOCKED INTO BOXING FROM OTHER FIELDS.

OF CHAMPIONSHIP FIGHTING, DEMPSEYTOLD BIOGRAPHER ROGER KAHN, “I WROTE IT BECAUSE THERE IS SUCH IGNORANCE ABOUTBOXING. . . . MOST OF THE BOXING I SEE TODAY IS JUST EMBARRASSING.”14 AMONGDEMPSEY’S TECHNICAL COMPLAINTS REGARDING STRAIGHT HITTING WERE THE FOLLOWING:[../Images/a.jpg] BEGINNERS ARE NOT GROUNDED IN THE FOUR PRINCIPAL METHODS OFPUTTING THE BODYWEIGHT IN FAST MOTION: (A) FALLING STEP, (B) LEG SPRING, (C)SHOULDER WHIRL, (D) UPWARD SURGE.[../Images/a.jpg] THE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT POWER LINE IN PUNCHING SEEMS TO HAVEBEEN FORGOTTEN.[../Images/a.jpg] THE WHOLESALE FAILURE OF INSTRUCTORS AND TRAINERS TOAPPRECIATE THE CLOSE CO-OPERATION NECESSARY BETWEEN THE POWER LINE AND WEIGHTMOTION RESULTS GENERALLY IN IMPURE PUNCHING —WEAK HITTING.[../Images/a.jpg] EXPLOSIVE STRAIGHT PUNCHING HAS BECOME ALMOST A LOST ART,BECAUSE INSTRUCTORS PLACE SO MUCH EMPHASIS ON SHOULDER WHIRL THAT BEGINNERS ARETAUGHT WRONGFULLY TO PUNCH STRAIGHT WITHOUT STEPPING WHENEVER POSSIBLE.[../Images/a.jpg] FAILURE TO TEACH THE FALLING STEP (“TRIGGER STEP”) FORSTRAIGHT PUNCHING HAS RESULTED IN THE LEFT JAB BEING USED GENERALLY AS A LIGHT,AUXILIARY WEAPON FOR MAKING OPENINGS AND “SETTING UP,” INSTEAD OF AS A STUNNINGBLOW.[../Images/a.jpg] NECESSITY FOR THE THREE-KNUCKLE LANDING IS NEVER POINTEDOUT.15[../Images/31a.jpg]FIGURE 3: JACK DEMPSEY.DEMPSEY WAS A MAJOR INFLUENCE ON THE JKD STRAIGHT LEAD. INDEED, IN HIS OWN COPYOF CHAMPIONSHIP FIGHTING, BRUCE HAD UNDERLINED KEY WORDS FROM THE ABOVE PASSAGE.AMONG THEM WERE “PUTTING BODY WEIGHT IN FAST MOTION,” “POWER LINE,” “SHOULDERWHIRL,” “TRIGGER STEP,” AND “THREE-KNUCKLE LANDING.” THESE ARE ISSUES THAT WE’LLSOON ADDRESS IN GREATER DETAIL.T H E B A D B O Y O F F E N C I N GOF THE STRAIGHT LEAD TRIUMVIRATE, I’VE SAVED THE MOST COLORFUL CHARACTER FORLAST: ALDO NADI, FENCING LEGEND AND FOUR-TIME OLYMPIC MEDALIST AT THE 1920ANTWERP OLYMPICS, WHOSE OFFTHE-STRIP ESCAPADES WERE EVERY BIT AS THRILLING ASHIS FENCING TRIUMPHS.LOADED WITH AN ARROGANCE THAT IS JUSTIFIED WHEN ACCOMPANIED BY GENIUS, NADI’SCONTEMPT FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD WAS ALSO DRIVEN BY AN INTENSE PASSION FORFENCING. THESE POLARIZED SIDES OF NADI IMPART A SENSE OF URGENCY TO HIS TREATISEON FENCING. AMONG THE BENEFITS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE FOIL, HE LISTS GENERALHEALTH, INTELLECTUAL ACUITY, BODY COMPOSITION, SCHOLASTIC ACHIEVEMENT, VALUES,AND CHARACTER BUILDING. SIMPLY PUT, “MAN IS HOW HE BEHAVES SWORD IN HAND.”16AND WHILE NADI WAS OBVIOUSLY DRIVEN TO WRITE ON FENCING BY HIS LOVE FOR THESPORT, HE TOO WAS ALARMED BY WHAT HE SAW AS THE DECLINE OF HIS SPORT,PARTICULARLY IN AMERICA. “IN MATTERS OF TRADITION AND PRINCIPLE,” HE WROTE, “IFEAR THE WORD COMPROMISE CANNOT BE FOUND IN MY VOCABULARY, LET ALONE IN MYACADEMY.”17LIKE DEMPSEY, NADI WAS FRUSTRATED BY THE DEARTH OF QUALITY TEACHERS OF HIS ART:> WHAT CONFOUNDS THE QUALIFIED TEACHER IS THAT ANYONE, HERE, CAN PROCLAIM> HIMSELF A FENCING MASTER OVERNIGHT, AND GET AWAY WITH IT. MANY OLD MASTERS> MUST BE TURNING IN THEIR GRAVES; AND IF THEY COULD ONLY JOIN US FOR A WHILE,> THEY WOULD CERTAINLY SAY SOMETHING ON THE SUBJECT. THE HISTORY OF FENCING> TELLS US THAT THIS ART WAS DEVELOPED THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES VIA DEATH AND> BLOOD, AND GRADUALLY MASTERED AS A SCIENCE BY HUNDREDS OF SCHOLARS WHO DEVOTED> THEIR ENTIRE LIVES TO ITS STUDY AND RESEARCH.IT APPEARS THAT MANY AMERICAN TEACHERS TAKE HALF A DOZEN LESSONS (PERHAPS FROMANOTHER SELF-APPOINTED TEACHER), READ HURRIEDLY A TREATISE OF MOST DOUBTFULVALUE, AND QUICKLY OBTAIN A POSITION AT A SUITABLE UNIVERSITY, COLLEGE, OR HIGHSCHOOL. IN A SIMILAR WAY, I MIGHT APPLY FOR A CHAIR OF HIGHER MATHEMATICS, ORSURGERY, IN ONE OF OUR UNIVERSITIES. INSTEAD OF LANDING THE JOB HOWEVER, I MIGHTBE POLITELY ESCORTED TO AN ASYLUM.18[../Images/33a.jpg]FIGURE 4: ALDO NADI (PHOTO BY RUDOLF COURTESY OF LAUREATE PRESS).KNOWN FOR HIS PLAYBOY ANTICS AND APPARENT BITTERNESS, NADI DEVELOPED AREPUTATION AS SOMETHING OF A BAD BOY, AND THIS NATURALLY SPILLED OVER INTO HISAPPROACH TO FENCING TECHNIQUE. HIS RAISED LEFT HEEL, A NADI TRADEMARK ADOPTED BYBRUCE LEE, IS TO THIS DAY CONSIDERED BAD FORM. “ALL FENCING TEACHERS WILL TELLYOU TO KEEP BOTH FEET CONSTANTLY FLAT ON THE STRIP,” HE WROTE. “I SAY—NO.”19TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THIS RULE BOGGLES THE MIND, BECAUSE IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLETO MAINTAIN SPRINGY MOBILITY WHILE TRYING TO KEEP YOUR LEFT HEEL ON THE GROUND.TRY IT SOMETIME. IT’S ALMOST PHYSIOLOGICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO BE FAST AND MOBILEWHILE KEEPING BOTH FEET FLAT. THERE’S A REASON WHY WE CALL SLOWPOKESFLATFOOTED.20IN LINE WITH NADI’S BREAK FROM TRADITION, IT’S NOT SURPRISING THAT BRUCELEE—WITH HIS DISDAIN FOR CLASSICAL, RIGID TRAINING LACKING SCIENTIFICINVESTIGATION—WOULD BE INFLUENCED BY NADI’S ON FENCING. I SUPPOSE THE REASONSTHAT MODERN FENCERS STILL PRACTICE WITH THE HEEL DOWN—EVEN WHILE THEY CLAIMNADI’S FOOTWORK WAS HIS GREATEST STRENGTH—ARE THE SAME REASONS THAT MODERNMARTIAL ARTISTS FAIL TO INVESTIGATE THE ADVANTAGES OF THE STRAIGHT LEAD. BUTWHAT THOSE REASONS ARE REMAINS A MYSTERY.[../Images/2.jpg]N O T E S1 M.

GOING BACK TO OUR ROOTS, REMEMBER THAT THE PHYSICALINGREDIENTS ARE:[../Images/a.jpg] ON-GUARD POSITIONING[../Images/a.jpg] FOOTWORK AND MOVEMENT[../Images/a.jpg] POSTURES IN RELAYING FORCEAND ALWAYS KEEP IN MIND THAT THESE PHYSICAL INGREDIENTS ARE DETERMINED BY THEUNDERLYING INGREDIENTS:[../Images/a.jpg] BALANCE[../Images/a.jpg] ECONOMY OF FORM[../Images/a.jpg] EFFICIENT MECHANICS1IN THE RUSH TO WHALE AWAY ON AN OPPONENT, PEOPLE MAY THINK THAT THE SMALLDETAILS ARE TRIVIAL MATTERS, AND THAT SIMPLY COUPLING APPROXIMATED GROSSMOVEMENTS WITH BRUTE FORCE IS ENOUGH. BUT PRECISION IN EXECUTING THE ROOTS OFJKD IS EVERYTHING. AS BRUCE HIMSELF ARGUED, NOTHING IS MORE FUNDAMENTAL THANGOOD FORM: “GOOD FORM IS THE MOST EFFICIENT MANNER TO ACCOMPLISH THE PURPOSE OFA PERFORMANCE WITH A MINIMUM OF LOST MOTION AND WASTED ENERGY. ALWAYS TRAIN INGOOD FORM.”2GIVEN BRUCE’S EMPHASIS ON FORM, IT’S SURPRISING TO SEE SO MANY PEOPLE FIGHTINGWITH SUCH SHODDILY CONSTRUCTED STANCES. EAGER TO HIT THINGS, THEY GLOSS OVER THEBASICS OF THE STANCE AND LATER WONDER WHY THEIR TECHNIQUE FALLS SHORT. WATCH AGOOD FIGHTER, AND NOTE THE DIFFERENCES. EFFICIENT FIGHTERS WASTE NOTHING. EVERYMOTION IS STREAMLINED, AND THAT MAKES THEM FAST. BETTER FIGHTERS ARE MORE MOBILEAND MORE EFFECTIVE AT TRANSFERRING WEIGHT INTO THEIR PUNCHES. CHANCES ARE THATTHE STANCE OF A GOOD FIGHTER LOOKS A LOT DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF LESSERFIGHTERS.PROPER FORM IN EXECUTING THE PHYSICAL COMPONENTS OF JKD MAKES THE UNDERLYINGELEMENTS—BALANCE, ECONOMY OF FORM, AND EFFICIENT MECHANICS—POSSIBLE. THE REWARDSOF GOOD FORM, AS YOU’LL SOON SEE, ARE INCREASED FORCE PRODUCTION, LEVERAGE,MOBILITY, SPEED, ELUSIVENESS, AND LONGEVITY—TO NAME A FEW.

AS YOU ARE LEARNING THEBASICS OF THE STANCE, THE MIRROR WILL GIVE YOU INVALUABLE FEEDBACK. IN THEBEGINNING, YOU’LL NEED IT TO CHECK YOUR ALIGNMENT, BECAUSE YOUR BODY DOESN’T YETKNOW HOW TO ACHIEVE THE PROPER FORM. WITH THE VISUAL FEEDBACK, THOUGH, YOU’LLPROGRESS MUCH FASTER. AS YOU TRAIN YOUR BODY, YOU’LL BE ABLE TO WEAN YOURSELFAWAY FROM THE MIRROR, AND YOU’LL BE ABLE TO FEEL WHEN YOU’RE DOING THINGSPROPERLY.WHICH BRINGS US TO THE SECOND ADVANTAGE OF VISUAL FEEDBACK. AS YOU BECOME MORETECHNICALLY PROFICIENT, YOU’LL USE THE CUES ACQUIRED FROM MIRROR TRAINING TOVISUALIZE TECHNIQUE. YOU’VE PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT THE WAY ELITE ATHLETES USEMENTAL IMAGERY TO PREPARE FOR COMPETITIVE EVENTS. OUR GREATEST ATHLETESSOMETIMES TALK OF ALMOST STEPPING OUTSIDE THEMSELVES AND SEEING THEMSELVESPERFORM. IF YOU TRAIN IN FRONT OF A MIRROR CORRECTLY, YOUR MENTAL IMAGERYBECOMES THAT MUCH MORE VIVID. MIRROR TRAINING, THEN, IS NOT JUST FOR BEGINNERSBUT FOR FIGHTERS OF ANY LEVEL.4 SEE FIGURE 5.[../Images/40a.jpg]FIGURE 5: UNTIL YOU HAVE PROPER BODY FEEL, CHECKING YOUR TECHNIQUE IN FRONT OF AMIRROR IS THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW YOUR FORM IS CORRECT.T H E F E E TAS I’VE ALREADY MENTIONED, EVERYTHING BEGINS AND ENDS WITH THE ON-GUARDPOSITION.

TO CONSTRUCTTHE STANCE, LET’S START FROM THE BOTTOM, THE FEET.IN THE BEGINNING, YOU’LL WANT TO FIND A SURFACE LIKE A BASKETBALL OR SQUASHCOURT THAT HAS MARKED LINES. OR YOU MIGHT WANT TO USE SOME CHALK OR TAPE TO MAKEYOUR OWN LINES. IT MAY SOUND LIKE SPLITTING HAIRS, BUT BY THE END OF THISCHAPTER, YOU’LL SEE WHY WE’RE SUCH STICKLERS FOR PRECISION.STAND WITH YOUR FEET SLIGHTLY WIDER THAN SHOULDERS’ WIDTH APART.

TO PROPERLY RELEASE THAT ENERGY, THOUGH, THE HEEL MUSTBE RAISED, GIVING SPRING TO THE ARCH OF THE FOOT AND PROVIDING A PUSH-OFF POINTIN THE BALL OF THE FOOT.T H E L O W E R B O D YMOVING UP, WE NOW NEED TO PROPERLY ALIGN THE LEGS. AGAIN, THEY WILL BE A LITTLEWIDER THAN SHOULDERS’ WIDTH APART, KNEES SLIGHTLY BENT. WE’VE JUST DISCUSSEDPOTENTIAL ENERGY IN RELATION TO FOOT POSITION. THE SAME APPLIES TO THE LEGS, FORIT IS THE LEFT LEG THAT WILL EXERT PRESSURE ON THE BALL OF THE FOOT, CAUSING THESPRING SO NECESSARY TO THE STRAIGHT LEAD.BECAUSE YOU WILL WANT TO PROPEL ALL YOUR BODY WEIGHT FORWARD, YOU DO NOT WANT TOWASTE ANY EXTRA ENERGY OVERCOMING UNNECESSARY INERTIA. THIS IS WHY YOU WANT TOFEEL ALL YOUR WEIGHT, ALL YOUR POTENTIAL ENERGY, CONCENTRATED ON THE INSIDE, ORMEDIAL SIDES, OF YOUR LEGS. IF YOUR FEET ARE POSITIONED CORRECTLY, YOU SHOULDALREADY BE FEELING THIS. SEE FIGURE 9.[../Images/43a.jpg]FIGURE 9: LEFT KNEE CORRECTLY TURNED SLIGHTLY INWARD. YOU SHOULD FEEL ALL OFYOUR WEIGHT ON THE MEDIAL SIDES OF YOUR LEGS.IF YOU FEEL SOME OF YOUR WEIGHT ROLLING TOWARD THE OUTSIDE OF YOUR FOOT, YOUWILL BE SLOWER TO INITIATE THE PUSH-OFF. AGAIN, WE WANT TO WASTE AS LITTLEENERGY AND TIME AS POSSIBLE, SO NOT HAVING YOUR WEIGHT CONCENTRATED IN THEOPTIMAL POSITION PRIOR TO THROWING A PUNCH IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE, A BIT LIKERUNNING UPHILL. THIS IS WHY THE LEFT TOE SHOULD BE SLIGHTLY TURNED INWARD. DOINGTHIS MEANS THAT WE’LL HAVE LESS INERTIA TO OVERCOME WHEN TRYING TO SPRINGFORWARD. SEE FIGURE 10.ALSO IMPORTANT TO THE STORING OF POTENTIAL ENERGY IS WHAT BRUCE REFERRED TO ASTHE “SMALL PHASIC BENT-KNEE STANCE,”8 THE BEND IN THE KNEES GIVES YOU GREATERFLEXIBILITY AND MOBILITY, ALLOWING YOU TO SPRING INTO ACTION AT WILL. OBVIOUSLY,IF YOU START FROM A STRAIGHT-LEG POSITION, YOU HAVE NOWHERE LEFT TO SPRING FROM,AND, THEREFORE, NO WAY OF GENERATING POWER. FROM A DEFENSIVE PERSPECTIVE, BENTKNEES ALLOW YOU TO GIVE A LITTLE WHEN RECEIVING PUNCHES, TAKING SOME OF THEFORCE OUT OF A BLOW. AND PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT ADVANTAGE OF A BENT-KNEESTANCE IS THAT IT PLACES YOUR CENTER OF GRAVITY IN THE OPTIMAL POSITION—IN OTHERWORDS, IT ENABLES YOU TO ACHIEVE BALANCE.[../Images/44a.jpg]FIGURE 10: LEFT KNEE INCORRECTLY TURNED OUTWARD.YOUR WEIGHT WILL ROLL OUTWARD, SLOWING YOUR PUNCH.B A L A N C E“CENTER OF GRAVITY” IS SIMPLY DEFINED AS THE POINT AROUND WHICH AN OBJECT’SWEIGHT IS EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED. SUPPOSE YOU WERE TO THROW A BASEBALL BAT. YOUWOULD NOTICE THE BAT WOBBLING AROUND THE FAT END, WHERE THE MAJORITY OF ITS MASSIS LOCATED. THE WOBBLING OCCURS ABOUT ITS CENTER OF GRAVITY. IF, ON THE OTHERHAND, YOU WERE TO THROW A BASEBALL, WHICH IS A SYMMETRICAL OBJECT, IT WOULD NOTWOBBLE, BECAUSE ITS CENTER OF GRAVITY IS LOCATED AT ITS CENTER. THE WAY THEHUMAN BODY IS STRUCTURED DETERMINES THAT OUR CENTER OF GRAVITY IS, FOR LACK OF ABETTER WORD, THE TUSH.POSITION OF THE CENTER OF GRAVITY IS CRUCIAL TO MAINTAINING BALANCE, AND BALANCEIS SOMETHING REPEATEDLY EMPHASIZED THROUGHOUT BRUCE LEE’S NOTES. TO ACHIEVEBALANCE, IMAGINE A LINE DROPPING STRAIGHT DOWN FROM ANY OBJECT’S CENTER OFGRAVITY. IF THAT LINE FALLS WITHIN THE BASE OF THE OBJECT, IT IS BALANCED. SEEFIGURE 11.IT ALSO FOLLOWS, THEN, THAT THE WIDER AN OBJECT’S BASE, THE MORE BALANCED, ORSTABLE, IT WILL BE. THINK OF A PYRAMID, ONE OF THE MOST STABLE STRUCTURES—WIDEBASE, LOW CENTER OF GRAVITY. RAISING AN OBJECT’S CENTER OF GRAVITY DECREASES THEAMOUNT OF FORCE REQUIRED TO TIP IT OFF-BALANCE, OR TO MOVE THE CENTER OF GRAVITYOUTSIDE ITS BASE OF SUPPORT. IN FIGURE 12, THE MODEL HAS A VERY WIDE STANCE, AWIDE BASE OF SUPPORT. IF WE WERE TO DRAW AN IMAGINARY LINE FROM HIS CENTER OFGRAVITY TO THE FLOOR, IT WOULD FALL WITHIN THE BASE DETERMINED BY HIS FEET.NOTICE THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A VERY WIDE STANCE, YOU FEEL AS IF NO ONE CAN KNOCKYOU OVER. YOU FEEL STABLE. SEE FIGURE 12.[../Images/45a.jpg]FIGURE 11: WHEN IN POSITION, YOUR FRONT AND BACK FEET FORM TWO POINTS OF ATRIANGULAR BASE. AN IMAGINARY LINE FROM YOUR CENTER OF GRAVITY TO THE FLOORSHOULD FALL WITHIN THE BASE OF THE TRIANGLE. THIS IS THE DEFINITION OF“BALANCE.”[../Images/45b.jpg]FIGURE 12: THIS STANCE IS TOO WIDE. WHILE EXTREMELY STABLE BECAUSE OF THE LOWERCENTER OF GRAVITY, MOBILITY IS GREATLY COMPROMISED.IF YOUR FEET ARE LESS THAN SHOULDERS’ WIDTH APART, YOU NARROW YOUR BASE OFSUPPORT, DECREASING STABILITY. YOUR CENTER OF GRAVITY IS RAISED. NOTICE HOW MUCHLESS STABLE YOU FEEL. IT WOULD TAKE LESS FORCE TO KNOCK YOU OVER. LIKEWISE, IFYOU CLOSE THE STANCE TOO MUCH BY LINING YOUR FRONT TOE UP WITH THE LEFT TOE,INSTEAD OF THE ARCH, YOU ALSO DECREASE THE BASE AREA AND LOSE STABILITY. SEEFIGURE 13 AND FIGURE 43.[../Images/46a.jpg]FIGURE 13: A STANCE THAT IS TOO NARROW DOES NOT PROVIDE ENOUGH STABILITY BECAUSEOF A RAISED CENTER OF GRAVITY.THE PROPER JKD STANCE, HOWEVER, IS DESIGNED TO KEEP YOUR CENTER OF GRAVITYWITHIN THE BASE DETERMINED BY THE PLACEMENT OF YOUR FEET. YOUR LEAD FOOT, REARFOOT, AND TRUNK FORM THE TRIANGULAR BASE. YOUR FOOT POSITION OFFSETS THE WEIGHTOF YOUR TRUNK. IF WE WERE TO DRAW A LINE FROM YOUR TRUNK TO THE GROUND, THATPOINT ON THE GROUND WOULD BE THE THIRD POINT OF THE BASE. I’LL TALK LATER ABOUTUPPER-BODY POSITIONING, BUT AT THIS TIME, JUST KNOW THAT THE SLIGHT CROUCH KEEPSYOUR CENTER OF GRAVITY WITHIN THE BASE OF SUPPORT. THE WEIGHT ALL AROUND YOURCENTER OF GRAVITY IS EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED. IF WE WERE TO DRAW A LINE FROM YOURCENTER OF GRAVITY TO THE FLOOR, IT WOULD FALL IN THE CENTER OF THE TRIANGLE. SEEFIGURE 14.KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS THE GENERAL JKD STANCE, IN WHICH YOUR WEIGHT ISDISTRIBUTED ABOUT FIFTY-FIFTY BETWEEN THE FRONT AND REAR LEG. WHEN WE GET INTOTHE MECHANICS OF THE STRAIGHT LEAD, YOU’LL ACTUALLY OFFSET THAT BALANCESLIGHTLY. ALSO KNOW THAT WHILE WIDENING YOUR STANCE MAY MAKE YOU MORE STABLE,YOU WILL SACRIFICE MOBILITY IN DOING SO. AGAIN, AIM FOR A LITTLE WIDER THANSHOULDERS’ WIDTH. EXPERIMENT AND STRIKE A BALANCED TRADE-OFF BETWEEN STABILITYAND MOBILITY.[../Images/47a.jpg]FIGURE 14: THE PROPER STANCE STRIKES A BALANCE BETWEEN MOBILITY AND STABILITY.FINALLY, REMEMBER THAT “PHASIC BENT-KNEE”? ONE OF ITS PURPOSES IS TO LOWER THECENTER OF GRAVITY, CONTRIBUTING TO A MORE STABLE STANCE. KEEP THIS IN MIND WHENWE GET TO THE CHAPTER ON MECHANICS. ONE OF THE MOST COMMON PROBLEMS JKD STUDENTSRUN INTO, IN EXECUTING THE LEAD PUNCH, IS THAT THEY OFTEN WILL STRAIGHTEN THEIRLEGS INSTEAD OF ROTATING THEIR HIPS. THIS CAUSES TWO PROBLEMS. ONE, THEIR CENTEROF GRAVITY OVERTAKES THEIR FRONT KNEE. THEIR CENTER OF GRAVITY, THEREFORE, FALLSOUTSIDE THE TRIANGULAR BASE, CAUSING IMBALANCE. TWO, STRAIGHTENING OF THE LEGSRAISES THE CENTER OF GRAVITY, FURTHER CONTRIBUTING TO INSTABILITY. BOTH WILLRESULT IN LESS FORCE PRODUCTION AND IN LACK OF MOBILITY. ALSO KNOW THAT YOURSTANCE MAY SLIGHTLY WIDEN WHEN YOU ARE WORKING AT KICKING RANGES. SEE FIGURE 15.[../Images/48a.jpg]FIGURE 15: ONCE YOUR CENTER OF GRAVITY OVERTAKES YOUR FRONT KNEE, IT FALLSOUTSIDE THE BASE OF THE TRIANGLE. YOU’LL LOSE NOT ONLY BALANCE BUT LEVERAGE ANDPOWER AS WELL.ON THE SUBJECT OF BALANCE AND STABILITY, BRUCE WAS HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY EDWINHAISLET, WHO ARGUED THE IMPORTANCE OF BODY ALIGNMENT. THE GREATEST CONTRIBUTORTO BALANCE, HAISLET ARGUED, IS FOOT POSITION. YOUR FEET, OF COURSE, ARECONNECTED TO YOUR LEGS, WHICH ARE CONNECTED TO YOUR TRUNK, WHICH IN TURN ISCONNECTED TO YOUR ARMS. SO PROPER ALIGNMENT MUST START WITH CORRECT FOOTPOSITION. THE ARM, ACCORDING TO HAISLET, IS MERELY A “VEHICLE OF BODY FORCE.”THE FIST MAY GET ALL THE GLORY, BUT IT’S REALLY ONLY ALONG FOR THE RIDE. YOURBODY DOES ALL THE WORK. AND THIS STARTS WITH THE STANCE. YOU WILL HAVE TOEXPERIMENT TO FIND THE WIDTH OF STANCE FOR OPTIMAL STABILITY AND MOBILITY, BUTALWAYS REMEMBER THAT YOUR CENTER OF GRAVITY MUST FALL WITHIN THE BASE DETERMINEDBY YOUR FOOT POSITION.9T H E U P P E R B O D Y : C A T S A N D C O B R A SA N D G R E A S E D L I G H T N I N GWHEN WE DISCUSS THE JKD STANCE AT REST, THINK OF YOURSELF AS STORING POTENTIALENERGY; AT ANY MOMENT YOU MAY UNCOIL AND LASH OUT WITH TREMENDOUS POWER ANDSPEED. WITH THIS IN MIND, YOU’LL WANT TO HUNCH YOUR BACK A LITTLE, WHICH GIVESYOU MORE SPACE FOR UNCOILING AT THE SHOULDER. THIS SERVES TO DECREASE YOURTARGET AREA AS WELL AND PUTS YOUR RIGHT SHOULDER IN A POSITION TO PROTECT YOURCHIN OR ROLL AWAY FROM PUNCHES. IN DESCRIBING THIS STORING OF ENERGY, BRUCE HADTHIS TO SAY:> SLIGHT CROUCH—BALANCE EVENLY ON YOUR RIGHT FOOT AND THE BALL OF YOUR LEFT> FOOT, WITH YOUR KNEES SLIGHTLY BENT—MORE ON THE ORDER OF A CAT WITH HIS BACK> HUNCHED UP AND READY TO SPRING (EXCEPT THAT YOU ARE RELAXED), OR LIKE A COBRA> COILED IN A RELAXED POSITION. LIKE A COBRA YOU MUST BE ABLE TO STRIKE SO THAT> YOUR TOUCH IS FELT BEFORE IT’S SEEN.10COMPARE WITH NADI:> TO FENCE WELL IS TO BE GREASED LIGHTNING WITH THE POTENTIAL FORWARD SPEED OF A> COILED SPRING. LIKE THE COBRA, A FENCER MUST REMAIN COILED IN A RELAXED> POSITION HAVING AT THE SAME TIME THE POTENTIALITY OF LEAPING FROM ABSOLUTE> IMMOBILITY TO TOP SPEED, POWER AND PRECISION. THE GUARD POSITION IS THE ONLY> POSITION FROM WHICH ONE CAN ATTACK EFFICIENTLY. LIKE THE COBRA, THE FENCER> MUST BE ABLE TO STRIKE (WITH THE POINT OF HIS BLADE) SO THAT HIS TOUCH IS FELT> BEFORE IT IS SEEN.11 SEE FIGURES 16 AND 17.FROM FIGURE 16, YOU’LL SEE THAT THERE IS A SLIGHT BEND AT THE WAIST (BUTREMEMBER TO KEEP YOUR CENTER OF GRAVITY LOW), AND THE BACK IS SLIGHTLY HUNCHED.THE POINT HERE IS THAT YOU WANT BE SLIGHTLY CURLED UP—TO PROTECT YOURSELF BYMAKING YOURSELF A SMALLER TARGET, BUT ALSO TO GIVE YOURSELF MORE ROOM FROM WHICHTO UNCOIL. YOU’RE STORING MORE POTENTIAL ENERGY FROM WHICH TO UNLEASH THAT LEADPUNCH.T H E P O W E R L I N EWHEN WE THINK OF STANCES, WE USUALLY THINK OF A STATIC POSITION, AN AT-RESTPOSITION. BUT WE’VE ALREADY ESTABLISHED THAT THE JKD STANCE IS DESIGNED TOMAXIMIZE MOBILITY AND FORCE PRODUCTION. WE STAND IN THE ON-GUARD POSITION SOTHAT WHEN WE DO HIT, WE’LL BE IN THE MOST FAVORABLE POSITION TO RELAY FORCE.WITH THIS IN MIND, WE NEED TO CONSIDER WHAT PROPER ALIGNMENT WILL LOOK LIKE ATTHE POINT OF IMPACT, AND ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF THE STANCE ATIMPACT IS THE POWER LINE.[../Images/50a.jpg]FIGURE 16: THE SLIGHTLY COILED JKD STANCE. THE BACK IS SLIGHTLY HUNCHED, AND THERIGHT HAND IS COMPLETELY RELAXED.[../Images/50b.jpg]FIGURE 17: SIDE VIEW OF UPPER-BODY COIL.THE POWER LINE IS THE REASON WHY WE PUNCH “THUMBS UP,” AS OPPOSED TO THEPALM-DOWN FIST WE SEE IN MODERN BOXING. IT’S ALSO WHY WE USE THE BOTTOM THREEKNUCKLES AS OUR STRIKING SURFACE INSTEAD OF THE TOP TWO KNUCKLES USED IN OTHERMARTIAL ARTS.THE POWER LINE IS QUITE SIMPLY DETERMINED BY OUR ANATOMY. IF YOU EXTEND YOUR ARMAND MAKE A FIST, YOU’LL SEE THAT THERE IS A STRAIGHT LINE FROM YOUR SHOULDER TOTHOSE BOTTOM THREE KNUCKLES, NOT TO THE TOP TWO KNUCKLES.THE ORIGINS OF THE POWER LINE MAY BE TRACED TO JACK DEMPSEY. CHAPTER 9 OFCHAMPIONSHIP FIGHTING IS HEAVILY UNDERLINED IN BRUCE LEE’S COPY.12 DEMPSEYDEFINED THE POWER LINE AS A STRAIGHT LINE THAT RUNS FROM YOUR SHOULDER AND EXITSAT YOUR BOTTOM FIST KNUCKLE. BECAUSE OF THE WAY WE ARE ANATOMICALLY STRUCTURED,THIS IS THE PUREST, MOST SOLID POINT OF CONTACT. TO USE THE TOP KNUCKLESDISRUPTS THE FOCUS OF THE POWER LINE.13 I DON’T MAKE THE RULES. WE’RE JUST BUILTTHIS WAY.IN ACCORDANCE WITH BRUCE LEE’S ADVOCATING OF KINESTHETIC LEARNING, I RECOMMENDTHAT YOU TRY THE FOLLOWING. STAND IN FRONT OF A WALL IN THE JKD STANCE. EXTENDYOUR ARM AND FIST. REST THE BOTTOM THREE KNUCKLES ON THE WALL. TAKE A MOMENT TOFEEL THE SOLIDITY OF CONTACT. TRY LIGHTLY TAPPING THE WALL AS YOU GO THROUGH THEMOTION OF THROWING A STRAIGHT. THIS IS HOW YOU SHOULD LAND EVERY TIME YOU THROWA STRAIGHT LEAD. SEE FIGURE 18.[../Images/51a.jpg]FIGURE 18: LINE UP AGAINST A WALL TO FEEL THE SOLIDITY OF THE POWER LINE.NOW DO THE SAME THING, BUT WITH THE TOP TWO KNUCKLES RESTING ON THE WALL. DO YOUFEEL HOW YOU’VE DEVIATED FROM THE POWER LINE? INSTEAD OF FORMING A STABLESTRAIGHT LINE FROM YOUR SHOULDER TO YOUR FIST, YOU’VE ACTUALLY CREATED AN ANGLEAT YOUR WRIST WITH YOUR FIST AND FOREARM. FEEL HOW UNSTABLE THIS IS. TRY TAPPINGAGAINST THE WALL. CAN YOU IMAGINE THROWING ALL OF YOUR BODY WEIGHT WITH YOURWRIST IN SUCH A PRECARIOUS POSITION? THIS IS HOW HAND AND WRIST INJURIES OCCUR.SEE FIGURE 19. JUST THINKING ABOUT HITTING WITH THOSE TWO KNUCKLES MAKES MEQUEASY![../Images/52a.jpg]FIGURE 19: INCORRECT USE OF TOP TWO KNUCKLES AT POINT OF IMPACT. USING THE TOPTWO KNUCKLES NECESSITATES A BEND AT THE WRIST, WHICH IS OFTEN THE CAUSE OFINJURIES.NOW COMPARE THIS WITH THE PROPER THUMBS-UP, BOTTOM-THREE-KNUCKLES FIST IN JKD,AS DEMONSTRATED IN FIGURE 20. YOU SHOULD BE FEELING A LOT MORE SOLID.[../Images/52b.jpg]FIGURE 20: CORRECT USE OF BOTTOM THREE KNUCKLES AT POINT OF IMPACT. THERE IS NOBEND AT THE WRIST, AND THE POWER LINE IS NOT DISRUPTED.KEEP IN MIND THAT ONE OF THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES OF THE STRAIGHT LEAD DESIGNIS NEWTON’S THIRD LAW, WHICH STATES THAT WHEN AN OBJECT EXERTS A FORCE ONANOTHER OBJECT, THAT SECOND OBJECT EXERTS AN EQUAL AND OPPOSITE FORCE ON THEFIRST. YOU’VE PROBABLY HEARD IT STATED AS, “FOR EVERY ACTION, THERE IS AN EQUALAND OPPOSITE REACTION.”PHYSICISTS WILL TELL YOU THAT THE APPLICATION OF FORCE IS NOT SO MUCH ONE THINGACTING ON ANOTHER AS IT IS AN INTERACTION BETWEEN TWO OBJECTS. SO IN OUR EXAMPLEOF TAPPING THE WALL WITH THE TOP TWO KNUCKLES, YOU EXERT A FORCE ON THE WALL,AND THAT JARRING YOU FEEL THROUGH YOUR SHOULDER AND ELBOW IS THE WALL EXERTING AFORCE ON YOU.ANOTHER EXAMPLE WOULD BE THE FOCUS PADS. YOU CAN ONLY EXERT AS MUCH FORCE ON THEMITT AS YOUR TRAINER IS EXERTING BACK TOWARD YOU. NOTICE THAT WHEN YOUR TRAINERDOESN’T GIVE YOU MUCH RESISTANCE, YOU CANNOT PUNCH WITH VERY MUCH FORCE. BUT IFYOUR TRAINER GIVES YOU MORE RESISTANCE, YOU PUNCH WITH MORE FORCE (AND HAVE ALOT MORE FUN). AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE, THINK OF TRYING TO PUNCH A PIECE OF PAPER,VERSUS HITTING THE HEAVY BAG. NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY, YOU CAN ONLY HIT THATPIECE OF PAPER SO HARD, BECAUSE IT CANNOT EXERT MUCH FORCE BACK. THE HEAVY BAG,ON THE OTHER HAND, ALLOWS YOU TO HIT MUCH HARDER BECAUSE IT SENDS BACK A MUCHGREATER FORCE.AS YOU CAN SEE FROM OUR EXPERIMENT WITH THE POWER LINE, THEN, THE JKD STANCE ISDESIGNED TO BEST WITHSTAND WHATEVER FORCE IS COMING BACK AT YOU. IT PUTS YOU INTHE BEST POSSIBLE ALIGNMENT TO ABSORB THE FORCE RETURNING FROM YOUR PUNCHES. ONEOF THE BENEFITS, OF COURSE, IS THAT THE POWER LINE MAKES FOR AN EFFICIENT PUNCH.NOTHING IS WASTED. ALL OF YOUR FORCE IS FOCUSED AND CONCENTRATED AND DIRECTEDTOWARD YOUR TARGET. THERE IS NO DISSIPATION AT THE WEAK LINKS AT THE WRIST, ASIS THE CASE WHEN A PUNCH IS INCORRECTLY LANDED WITH THE TOP TWO KNUCKLES. IN APROPERLY CONSTRUCTED JKD STANCE, THERE ARE NO WEAK LINKS.THE SECOND BENEFIT OF THE BOTTOM-THREE-KNUCKLE LANDING IS A “BIG PICTURE”ARGUMENT. SINCE THE STRAIGHT LEAD IS THE MOST FREQUENTLY THROWN PUNCH IN JKD, ITMAKES SENSE THAT WE WANT TO INCUR THE LEAST WEAR AND TEAR ON OUR BODIES FROMTHROWING IT. GOOD FORM IS WHAT WILL KEEP YOU IN JKD FOR THE LONG HAUL. IT IS WHYTED WONG, AT SIXTY-FIVE AS OF THIS WRITING, IS STILL ACTIVELY PRACTICING, WHILEMANY OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES HAVE BEEN SIDELINED WITH INJURIES. HE’LL TELL YOUTHAT HE EVEN HITS HARDER THAN HE DID MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS AGO, AND HEATTRIBUTES THIS TO THE SOUND MECHANICS HE’S HONED OVER THOSE YEARS. AS BRUCEOBSERVED, “THE OLDER ATHLETE REGARDS FORM AS A MEANS OF ENERGY CONSERVATION ANDTHE GREAT ATHLETE SAVES ENERGY BECAUSE HIS EXTRA SKILL MAKES EACH MOTION MOREEFFECTIVE—HE MAKES FEWER NEEDLESS MOTIONS AND HIS CONDITIONED BODY USES LESSENERGY PER MOVEMENT.”14SO IF YOU HAVE ANY INTENTIONS OF PRACTICING JKD FOR A LONG TIME, YOU MUST BEABLE TO FEEL AND UTILIZE THE POWER LINE.R E A R H A N DTHE REAR HAND IS POSITIONED FOR PROTECTION, TO PARRY AND BLOCK BLOWS AIMED ATYOUR HEAD. YOU’LL WANT TO KEEP YOUR LEFT HAND CLOSE TO THE LEFT SIDE OF YOURCHIN. A GOOD LEFT HAND AND JUDGMENT OF DISTANCE CAN MAKE YOU NEARLY IMPOSSIBLETO HIT. PARRYING WITH THE LEFT HAND ALSO GIVES YOU A FEEL FOR YOUR OPPONENT’SRANGE.YOU’LL ALSO WANT TO KEEP YOUR ELBOW CLOSE, TO PROTECT YOUR SIDE. BY SIMPLYTURNING YOUR TRUNK, YOU CAN DEFLECT MOST BLOWS TO THE BODY WITH YOUR LEFT ARM,AS SHOWN IN FIGURE 21.[../Images/54a.jpg]FIGURE 21: WITH A SLIGHT TURN TO THE RIGHT, THE LEFT ARM PROVIDES PROTECTION ASYOU ROLL WITH THE PUNCH.T H E F R O N T H A N DTO CORRECTLY POSITION THE FRONT HAND, STAND IN THE STANCE AS WE’VE DISCUSSED SOFAR, WITH YOUR LEAD HAND EXTENDED AND RESTING AT YOUR SIDE. KEEPING YOURSHOULDER COMPLETELY RELAXED, BEND YOUR ARM AT THE ELBOW AT ABOUT AFORTY-FIVE-DEGREE ANGLE. SEE FIGURE 22.[../Images/55a.jpg]FIGURE 22: CORRECT POSITION OF THE FRONT HAND. THERE IS NO SPACE BETWEEN MY ARMAND MY SIDE. THIS ALLOWS FOR COMPLETE RELAXATION OF THE ARM.[../Images/55b.jpg]FIGURE 23: INCORRECT POSITION OF THE FRONT HAND. THE SLIGHT EXTENSION AT THESHOULDER PLACES UNNECESSARY TENSION ON THE ARM, WHICH WILL SLOW YOUR PUNCH.THERE SHOULD BE LITTLE SPACE, IF ANY, BETWEEN YOUR ARM AND YOUR SIDE. HOLDINGYOUR ARM AWAY FROM YOUR BODY PLACES TENSION ON YOUR SHOULDER, AND YOU’LL BEWASTING ENERGY HOLDING YOUR ARM OUT. THIS WILL SLOW YOU DOWN.SOME PEOPLE INCORRECTLY THINK THAT HOLDING YOUR ARM OUT GIVES YOU A SPEEDADVANTAGE, BY KEEPING THE HAND CLOSER TO THE TARGET, BUT IT WILL ONLY FATIGUEYOUR POOR DELTOIDS, MAKING YOU SLOW. AS WITH OUR PHASIC BENT KNEE, KEEPING THEARM CLOSE GIVES YOU MORE POTENTIAL ENERGY. YOU HAVE SOMEWHERE FROM WHICH TO LASHOUT. IF YOUR ARM IS ALREADY EXTENDED, YOU HAVE A TIRED ARM WITH NOWHERE LEFT TOGO. SEE FIGURE 23.THE GUNSIGHTNOW LET’S BE A LITTLE MORE PRECISE ABOUT POSITIONING THE LEAD HAND. HAVE SOMEONESTAND IN FRONT OF YOU, AND WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND UP, EXTEND YOUR RIGHT INDEXFINGER. WHERE IS YOUR FINGER POINTING? IT SHOULD BE TOWARD THE TARGET, YOUROPPONENT’S NOSE. IF YOU FIND YOURSELF POINTING TOO LOW—SAY, AT YOUR OPPONENT’SFOOT—READJUST YOUR HAND SO THAT YOU’RE POINTING AT THE NOSE. LIKEWISE, IF YOUFIND YOURSELF POINTING AT THE SKY, YOU’RE AIMING TOO HIGH. AGAIN, ADJUST YOURHAND SO THAT YOU’RE POINTING AT YOUR OPPONENT’S HEAD. NOW CLOSE YOUR FIST. THISIS THE CORRECT POSITION OF THE HAND. SEE FIGURES 24 THROUGH 26.[../Images/56a.jpg]FIGURE 24: TO CHECK IF YOUR HAND POSITION IS CORRECT, EXTEND YOUR INDEX FINGER.IT SHOULD POINT DIRECTLY AT YOUR TARGET—IN THIS CASE, MY OPPONENT’S FACE.[../Images/57a.jpg]FIGURE 25: CLOSE YOUR FIST. THIS IS YOUR CORRECT LEAD HAND POSITION.[../Images/57b.jpg]FIGURE 26: FROM THE CORRECT HAND POSITION, SHOOT YOUR FIST STRAIGHT OUT. THIS ISTHE FASTEST WAY TO REACH YOUR TARGET WITH THE LEAD HAND.THINK OF YOUR RIGHT HAND AS A GUNSIGHT. YOU ALWAYS WANT TO KEEP YOUR TARGETWITHIN RANGE OF THIS GUNSIGHT, WHICH IS YOUR CORRECTLY PLACED HAND. THIS WILLINCREASE YOUR ACCURACY, OF COURSE, BUT IT WILL ALSO INCREASE YOUR SPEED, BECAUSEYOUR HAND IS ALREADY POSITIONED TO HIT THE TARGET WITHOUT ANY OTHER ADJUSTMENTS.YOU JUST SHOOT YOUR HAND OUT. NO FUSS, NO MUSS.IF THE HAND IS POSITIONED TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW, YOU’LL HAVE TO LOWER OR RAISEBOTH YOUR HAND AND FOREARM FIRST AND THEN SHOOT OUT. THIS EXTRA MOVEMENT NOTONLY SLOWS YOU DOWN BUT TELEGRAPHS YOUR ATTACK AS WELL. SEE FIGURES 27 THROUGH30.[../Images/58a.jpg]FIGURE 27: IF YOUR FRONT HAND IS KEPT TOO LOW (LEFT), YOU’LL BE POINTING AT YOUROPPONENT’S KNEECAP.[../Images/58b.jpg]FIGURE 28: YOU’LL HAVE TO RAISE YOUR HAND FIRST, BEFORE YOU CAN FIRE A STRAIGHTPUNCH.[../Images/59a.jpg]FIGURE 29: IF YOUR HAND IS POSITIONED TOO HIGH (LEFT), YOU’LL BE POINTING TOWARDTHE SKY.[../Images/59b.jpg]FIGURE 30: KEEPING YOUR HAND TOO HIGH REQUIRES YOU TO LOWER YOUR HAND BEFORE YOUCAN THROW A PUNCH.T R U N K R O T A T I O NI’LL TALK MORE ABOUT MECHANICS AND HIP ROTATION LATER, BUT LET’S TOUCH ON THESUBJECT HERE, IN RELATION TO WHAT PROPER ALIGNMENT LOOKS LIKE AT IMPACT. FROMTHE ON-GUARD POSITION, EXTEND YOUR LEAD ARM AS YOU ROTATE YOUR HIPSCOUNTERCLOCKWISE. AS YOUR HIP ROTATES, YOUR SHOULDER WILL FOLLOW. SEE FIGURES 31AND 32.[../Images/60a.jpg]FIGURE 31: STRAIGHT LEAD FROM CORRECT STANCE[../Images/60b.jpg]FIGURE 32: HIP ROTATION WITH ARM EXTENSION. NOTICE HOW THIS MAKES ME LESS OF ATARGET BY DECREASING THE TARGET AREA. THE CENTERLINE IS VIRTUALLY UNREACHABLE.NOTICE THAT AS YOU ROTATE YOUR HIPS AND SHOULDERS, YOU ACTUALLY BECOME ANARROWER TARGET, MAKING YOU LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO COUNTERATTACKS. PASSAGES IN BOTHTHE TAO OF JEET KUNE DO15 AND EDWIN L. HAISLET’S BOXING16 ADDRESS THISADDITIONAL ADVANTAGE OF THE STANCE. BY THE WAY, THROWING A MODERN-DAY BOXING JABDOES NOT GIVE YOU THIS BENEFIT. THE PALM-DOWN JAB DOES NOTHING TO NARROW YOURTARGET AREA. IT IS ONLY THE STRAIGHT LEAD THAT ALLOWS YOU TO FURTHER PROTECT THECENTERLINE AS YOU LAUNCH AN OFFENSIVE.S T R A I G H T S H O O T E RWE CALL IT STRAIGHT HITTING FOR A REASON. FROM THE ON-GUARD POSITION, YOUR RIGHTHAND SHOULD SHOOT STRAIGHT OUT AND RETRACT ALONG EXACTLY THE SAME PATH. I’VEALREADY TALKED ABOUT HOW KEEPING THE TARGET WITHIN RANGE OF THE GUNSIGHT WILLKEEP YOUR PUNCH STRAIGHT AND IMPROVE ACCURACY. ANOTHER IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTOR TOSTRAIGHT HITTING IS THE POSITION OF YOUR LEAD ELBOW. IT SHOULD BE KEPT CLOSE TOTHE BODY. IF KEPT TOO FAR AWAY, YOUR TARGET WILL BE OUT OF GUN-SIGHT RANGE.NOTICE HOW YOU’LL BE POINTING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.KEEPING YOUR ELBOWS CLOSE ALSO SERVES A DEFENSIVE PURPOSE BY GIVING YOUROPPONENT LESS OF A TARGET. SEE FIGURES 33 AND 34.[../Images/61a.jpg]FIGURE 33: ELBOW POINTING AWAY FROM THE BODY. IF YOU WERE TO EXTEND YOUR INDEXFINGER FROM THIS POSITION, YOU’D BE POINTING DOWNWARD AND OFF TO THE SIDE. INORDER TO THROW A STRAIGHT LEAD, YOU’D FIRST HAVE TO CENTER AND RAISE THE FRONTHAND.[../Images/62a.jpg]FIGURE 34: CORRECT ELBOW POSITION FOR STRAIGHT LEAD. KEEPING THE ELBOW CLOSE TOYOUR BODY ENABLES CORRECT POSITIONING OF THE HAND AND, CONSEQUENTLY, MOREEFFICIENT PUNCHING.[../Images/2.jpg]R E L A X, M A XRELAXATION, BOTH MENTAL AND PHYSICAL, IS SOMETHING REPEATEDLY REFERRED TO IN THETAO OF JEET KUNE DO, AS IT SHOULD BE WITH ALL SPORTS AND MARTIAL ARTS. IN ANYMOVEMENT, WE HAVE SOMETHING CALLED “FORCE-COUPLE RELATIONSHIPS” OCCURRING. THISMEANS THAT MUSCLES—AGONISTS, SYNERGISTS, STABILIZERS, NEUTRALIZERS, ANDANTAGONISTS—ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO CREATE THE MOST EFFICIENT MOVEMENT AROUND AJOINT.17 TO MAXIMIZE EFFICIENCY, WE WANT TO MINIMIZE EXTRANEOUS MOTION ANDUNNECESSARY TENSION.I’VE JUST MENTIONED MUSCLES CALLED AGONISTS AND ANTAGONISTS. AGONISTS ARE PRIMEMOVERS THAT CREATE JOINT MOTION. FOR INSTANCE, WHEN WE THROW OUT A STRAIGHTLEAD, WE ARE PERFORMING A PUSHING MOTION. THE TRICEPS ACT AS PRIME MOVERS.ANTAGONISTS ARE MUSCLES THAT ACT IN DIRECT OPPOSITION TO THE PRIME MOVERS.18 ASWE THROW OUT A LEAD PUNCH, THE BICEPS ARE ANTAGONISTS, BECAUSE THEY ARE INVOLVEDMAINLY IN PULLING MOTIONS. THEREFORE, THEY ACT IN OPPOSITION TO THE TRICEPS. ASWE SHOOT OUT A STRAIGHT, THEN, WE WANT TO ACTIVATE THE TRICEPS WHILE RELAXINGTHE BICEPS.AS WE RETRACT THE HAND, THOUGH, THE OPPOSITE IS DESIRABLE. WHEN WE PULL BACK THEHAND, THE BICEPS BECOME THE PRIME MOVERS—THE AGONISTS—AND THE TRICEPS BECOME THEANTAGONISTS THAT WE MUST RELAX.IF ANTAGONISTS ARE FIGHTING AGAINST THE PRIME MOVERS, YOU WILL BE SLOW—ANDTIRED. IT’S HARD ENOUGH TO FIGHT AN OPPONENT; YOU DON’T WANT TO BE FIGHTINGYOURSELF AS WELL. MAINTAINING UNNECESSARY TENSION WASTES ENERGY. THIS IS WHY WEWANT TO REST THE RIGHT ARM AGAINST OUR SIDE INSTEAD OF HOLDING IT AWAY FROM THEBODY. KEEPING THE ARM AWAY FROM THE BODY REQUIRES UNNECESSARY CONTRACTION OF THEMUSCLES TO HOLD IT UP. YOUR DELTOID HAS TO WORK OVERTIME JUST TO KEEP YOUR ARMIN THAT POSITION. THEN, ALREADY IN A FATIGUED STATE, IT MUST THROW OUT A PUNCH.IF YOU SEE A FIGHTER CONSTANTLY HOLDING THE LEAD ARM AWAY FROM THE BODY, YOUALREADY KNOW THAT HE OR SHE WILL NOT BE FAST WITH THE LEAD HAND.LIKEWISE, BEING IN A GENERAL STATE OF TENSION—MENTAL AND PHYSICAL—WILL ALSO SLOWYOU DOWN. IF THE AGONISTS AND ANTAGONISTS ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY ACTIVATED, THEPRIME MOVER MUST OVERCOME THE COUNTERACTION OF THE ANTAGONISTS BEFORE IT CANPERFORM THE DESIRED MOVEMENT. AGAIN, YOU WILL BE SLOW, SLOW, SLOW.OF COURSE, THIS IS ALL EASIER SAID THAN DONE. TRUE RELAXATION IS ONLY ACHIEVABLEONCE YOU HAVE MASTERED THE MECHANICS. PROPER FORM AND MECHANICAL SEQUENCE HAVEBEEN DESIGNED TO MAXIMIZE AGONIST MUSCLE ACTIVITY WHILE MINIMIZING ANTAGONISTACTIVITY. THIS IS A MATTER OF NEUROMUSCULAR PROGRAMMING, WHICH ONLY COMES FROMHOURS OF PRACTICE. AND MENTAL RELAXATION CAN ONLY BE DEVELOPED FROM EXPERIENCEIN COMBATIVE SITUATIONS.FAILURE TO COMPLETELY RELAX ANTAGONISTS WHILE TRYING TO EMPLOY PRIME MOVERS ISOBVIOUSLY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. SO, AS MY FAVORITE DINAH WASHINGTON SONG GOES,“RELAX, MAX.”[../Images/2.jpg]B O D Y F E E LBEFORE CONCLUDING THIS CHAPTER ON THE STANCE, AND AS WE PREPARE TO DELVE INTOFOOTWORK AND STRAIGHT LEAD MECHANICS, I’D LIKE TO STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF BODYFEEL. THE ADOPTION OF ANY NEW POSTURE (STANCE) OR MOVEMENT REQUIRES A COMPLEXPROCESS OF NEUROMUSCULAR PROGRAMMING.THINK ABOUT ALL THE NEW INFORMATION YOUR BODY MUST PROCESS. THERE’S SENSORYINFORMATION, WHICH INCLUDES BOTH EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL INPUT. EXTERNAL INPUTCOMES FROM THE ENVIRONMENT, SUCH AS THE KIND OF SURFACE ON WHICH YOU’REMOVING—GRASS VERSUS CONCRETE, FOR EXAMPLE. INTERNAL INFORMATION MAY COME FROMSENSORY ORGANS—FOR EXAMPLE, THE MUSCLE SPINDLES IN YOUR MUSCLE FIBERS SENSE THELENGTH OF YOUR MUSCLES AND THE RATE AT WHICH THEIR LENGTH CHANGES.SENSORY INFORMATION MUST THEN BE INTERPRETED BY YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM, TO ALLOWYOUR BODY TO RESPOND APPROPRIATELY. THIS IS YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM’S INTEGRATIVEFUNCTION. THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THEN SENDS THE INFORMATION TO EFFECTORS, MOTORNEURONS IN YOUR MUSCLES, SO THAT YOUR MUSCLES WILL PERFORM THE CORRECT RESPONSE.PRETTY AMAZING, ISN’T IT?AS YOU LEARN A NEW TECHNIQUE, YOUR BODY IS MAKING ALL SORTS OF NEW NEURALPATHWAYS. YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IS PROGRAMMING YOUR BODY TO ASSIMILATE INFORMATIONAND RESPOND IN A SPECIFIC WAY.PERHAPS THE STANCE HAS FELT A BIT AWKWARD SO FAR. THAT’S ALL RIGHT. YOUR BODY ISSIMPLY TRYING TO PROGRAM ITSELF INTO MAINTAINING THAT POSITION. THE REASON THATI STRESS BODY FEEL, HOWEVER, IS THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE PROGRAMMINGCORRECTLY. IT MAKES NO SENSE TO DO THINGS INCORRECTLY, DEVELOP BAD HABITS, HAVETO BREAK BAD HABITS, AND THEN REPROGRAM.IN THE TAO, BRUCE REFERRED TO THIS AS KINESTHETIC PERCEPTION OR “GETTING THEFEEL OF IT.” IT’S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT HE WAS NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT MOVEMENTBUT WAS REFERRING TO “POSTURES”—THE STANCE—AS WELL.19ALL PHYSICAL TRAINING IS KINESTHETIC LEARNING. I EMPHASIZE ITS IMPORTANCEBECAUSE THERE ARE MANY THINGS I DISCUSS IN THIS BOOK THAT WILL BE IMPERCEPTIBLEEVEN TO THE TRAINED EYE. AS WE START PUTTING OURSELVES INTO MOTION FROM THESTANCE, THIS WILL BECOME MORE APPARENT, BUT IT ALL STARTS WITH THE STANCE.DO NOT JUST EMULATE WHAT YOU SEE IN THESE ILLUSTRATIONS. BE SURE YOU ARE FEELINGTHE SENSATIONS THAT I DESCRIBE. IS YOUR RIGHT SHOULDER COMPLETELY RELAXED? DOYOU FEEL ALL OF YOUR WEIGHT AND POTENTIAL ENERGY IN THE MEDIAL SIDES OF YOURLEGS? IS ALL THE PRESSURE CONCENTRATED ON THE BALL OF YOUR LEFT FOOT? DO YOUFEEL THE SOLIDITY OF THE POWER LINE WHEN LANDING WITH THE BOTTOM THREE KNUCKLES?IS YOUR LEFT HEEL RAISED JUST ENOUGH OR TOO MUCH?THE HEEL IS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE. THAT CRITICAL HALF INCH OR INCH TOO HIGH ISSOMETHING YOUR INSTRUCTOR MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO SEE. EVERYONE IS A LITTLEANATOMICALLY DIFFERENT. YOU’LL HAVE TO FEEL IT OUT. IF YOUR HEEL IS RAISED TOOHIGH, YOUR CENTER OF GRAVITY WILL BE RAISED AS WELL, AND YOU WILL LACKSTABILITY. TOO LOW, AND YOU MAY LOSE SPRINGINESS. BRUCE ENCOURAGED THE“[INVESTIGATION] OF ‘BODY FEEL’ TO RELAY DIFFERENT PARTS OF FOOT TOOLS (HEEL,BALL, INSTEP) TO [THE] TARGET.”20 ALWAYS TAKE THE EXTRA TIME TO STOP AND ASKYOURSELF HOW A PARTICULAR ALIGNMENT, POSTURE, OR TECHNIQUE FEELS.SIMPLY GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS IS NOT ENOUGH. THE FACT THAT YOUR FEET AND ARMSARE ALIGNED SIMILARLY TO THOSE IN THE ILLUSTRATIONS DOESN’T MEAN THAT YOU ARECOMPLETELY IN THE CORRECT STANCE. YOU MUST FEEL ALL THAT POTENTIAL ENERGY INYOUR LEFT FOOT. YOU MUST FEEL YOUR CENTER OF GRAVITY STRIKING THE CORRECTBALANCE OF MOBILITY AND STABILITY. AND WHEN YOU HIT IT, WHEN IT FEELS GOOD, TAKENOTE OF IT. REMEMBER IT. LET YOUR BODY REMEMBER IT.RETURNING TO THE ROOTS OF JKD: “REAL KNOWLEDGE BREEDS ‘BODY FEEL.’ SURFACEKNOWLEDGE BREEDS MECHANICAL CONDITIONING.”21 ONCE YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THEBASICS OF THE STANCE, LISTEN TO YOUR BODY. ON THE WAY TO REFINING YOURMECHANICS, YOUR BODY WILL LEARN HOW TO PUT ITSELF IN THE BEST POSITION TOGENERATE FORCE AND TRANSFER IT TO THE TARGET. JKD IS NOT JUST A CEREBRALENDEAVOR. IT’S PHYSICAL. REAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE STRAIGHT LEAD MEANS THAT YOURBODY—NOT JUST YOUR HEAD—UNDERSTANDS.[../Images/2.jpg]S E E F O R Y O U R S E L FWE’VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT BODY FEEL. HERE’S A LITTLE EXPERIMENT YOU CAN TRY THATWILL ENABLE YOU TO FEEL FOR YOURSELF WHAT MAKES THE STRAIGHT LEAD SO EFFECTIVE.FIRST, LINE UP IN THE CORRECT JKD STANCE. HAVE A FRIEND APPLY FORCE BY HITTINGYOUR FIST WITH THE PALM OF HIS HAND. TAKE A MOMENT TO NOTE HOW YOUR BODY ABSORBSTHAT FORCE. SEE FIGURES 35 AND 36.[../Images/65a.jpg]FIGURE 35: CORRECT JKD STANCE.[../Images/65b.jpg]FIGURE 36: APPLY FORCE TO JKD STANCE AND NOTE FEELING AT IMPACT.NOW STAND IN A TRADITIONAL WING CHUN STANCE (SEE FIGURES 37 AND 38), SQUARELYFACING YOUR OPPONENT, FIST EXTENDED AS IT WOULD BE AT THE POINT OF CONTACT.NOTICE HOW YOU FEEL OFF-BALANCE WHEN YOUR PARTNER HITS YOUR HAND. WHERE DO YOUFEEL YOUR BODY TAKING MOST OF THE BLOW? THE SHOULDER? THE ELBOW? THE HIPS?[../Images/66a.jpg]FIGURE 37: WING CHUN STANCE.[../Images/66b.jpg]FIGURE 38: APPLY FORCE TO WING CHUN STANCE AND NOTE FEELING AT IMPACT.NEXT, MOVE FROM YOUR WING CHUN STANCE INTO A MODERN BOXING STANCE (SEE FIGURES39 AND 40). IMAGINE A STRAIGHT LINE POINTING STRAIGHT TO YOUR TARGET. ALIGN YOURRIGHT TOE SO THAT IT FORMS A THIRTY-DEGREE ANGLE WITH THIS LINE. THE ARCH OFYOUR REAR, OR LEFT, FOOT SHOULD BE DIRECTLY OVER THIS LINE WITH THE HEEL DOWN.HAVE YOUR PARTNER HIT YOUR FIST AGAIN. YOU SHOULD FEEL EVEN LESS OF THE FORCE.[../Images/67a.jpg]FIGURE 39: MODERN BOXING STANCE WITH HEEL AND PALM DOWN.[../Images/67b.jpg]FIGURE 40: APPLY FORCE TO BOXING STANCE AND NOTE FEELING ON IMPACT.NOW TRY THIS. MOVE YOUR LEFT FOOT OFF THE LINE AND OPEN UP YOUR STANCE. NOTICETHE LOSS OF STABILITY. SEE FIGURES 41 AND 42.[../Images/68a.jpg]FIGURE 41: STANCE THAT IS TOO OPEN.[../Images/68b.jpg]FIGURE 42: BOXING STANCE THAT IS TOO WIDE, WITH PALM DOWN.NOW TRY NARROWING YOUR STANCE, WITH YOUR RIGHT TOE ALIGNED WITH YOUR LEFT TOE.NOW YOUR STANCE IS TOO NARROW.

NOTICE HOW MUCH LESSSTABLE THIS FEELS.[../Images/69a.jpg]FIGURE 43: STANCE THAT IS TOO CLOSED.[../Images/69b.jpg]FIGURE 44: APPLY FORCE TO NARROW BOXING STANCE AND NOTE FEELING AT IMPACT.NOW LET’S RETURN TO THE JKD STANCE. LINE UP YOUR FEET CORRECTLY, WITH THE TOE OFYOUR FRONT FOOT LINED UP WITH THE ARCH OF YOUR REAR FOOT. RAISE YOUR LEFT HEELSLIGHTLY, AS NADI WOULD INSTRUCT YOU TO DO. REMEMBER THAT THIS IS THE PISTON OFTHE ENTIRE FIGHTING MACHINE! AS YOUR PARTNER HITS YOUR FIST, YOU SHOULD FEEL ANOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE FROM OUR ORIGINAL WING CHUN STANCE. YOU SHOULD FEEL MUCHMORE BALANCED, ABLE TO ABSORB MOST OF THE BLOW WITHOUT ANY STRESS ON JOINTS OROTHER BODY PARTS.WE STILL HAVE ONE FINAL STEP. ROTATE YOUR HIPS, ENABLING FULL SHOULDEREXTENSION. THIS IS THE POINT OF IMPACT FOR A PROPERLY THROWN JKD STRAIGHT LEAD.KEEP YOUR CENTER OF GRAVITY LOW. YOU SHOULD FEEL SOLID AS A ROCK WITH VIRTUALLYNO IMPACT FROM YOUR PARTNER’S FORCE. SEE FIGURE 45.[../Images/70a.jpg]FIGURE 45: BACK TO THE JKD STANCE.REMEMBER NEWTON’S THIRD LAW: WHEN ONE OBJECT EXERTS A FORCE ON A SECOND OBJECT,THE SECOND OBJECT EXERTS AN EQUAL BUT OPPOSITE FORCE ON THE FIRST. APPLY THISLAW TO HITTING THE HEAVY BAG. YOU HIT THE BAG. THE BAG EXERTS AN EQUAL FORCEBACK AT YOU. SOMETIMES YOU DON’T LAND SQUARELY, AND THAT JARRING EFFECT YOU GETIS THE BAG SENDING EQUAL BUT OPPOSITE FORCE AT YOU.THE WHOLE IDEA OF THE JKD STANCE IS TO ALIGN YOURSELF TO RECEIVE THE LEASTAMOUNT OF PUNISHMENT COMING BACK TO YOU. WHEN YOU SEND OUT YOUR PUNCH, YOU AREIN THE BEST POSSIBLE POSITION TO RECEIVE THE EQUAL BUT OPPOSITE RETURNING FORCE.YOU ARE ALSO SENDING OUT THE MOST EFFICIENT AND POWERFUL PUNCH POSSIBLE. YOU AREALIGNED IN SUCH A WAY AS NOT TO LOSE ANY POWER ALONG THE KINETIC CHAIN. IN OTHERWORDS, YOU HAVE NO WEAK LINKS, AND BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT LOSING ANY POWER ALONGTHE WAY, YOU ARE SENDING EVERYTHING IN YOUR OPPONENT’S DIRECTION.THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST ARGUMENTS FOR THE JKD STANCE, OF COURSE, BUT PEOPLEOFTEN OVERLOOK THE FACT THAT PROPER TECHNIQUE IN THROWING A STRAIGHT LEAD CANKEEP YOU IN THE GAME, THANKS TO NEWTON’S LAW. A PROPERLY THROWN STRAIGHT LEADCAUSES THE LEAST WEAR AND TEAR ON JOINTS, TENDONS, LIGAMENTS, AND SO ON. IT’SALL A MATTER OF PUTTING SCIENCE AND PRECISION INTO PRACTICE.22[../Images/2.jpg]N O T E S1 BRUCE LEE, ED.

TO TRULYUNDERSTAND THOSE MECHANICS, WE’LL HAVE TO REVIEW SOME ELEMENTARY PHYSICS ALONGTHE WAY.OVER THE YEARS, I’VE COME TO REALIZE WHAT A TECHNICAL MARVEL THE STRAIGHT LEADIS. IN INVESTIGATING THE DISCIPLINES OF BIOMECHANICS, PHYSICS, AND THE HISTORYOF FIGHTING SCIENCE, BRUCE LEE WAS AHEAD OF HIS TIME, AND JUDGING FROM THE WAYTHAT MANY PEOPLE STILL THROW THEIR PUNCHES, HE’S STILL LIGHT YEARS AHEAD.INDEED, THE STRAIGHT LEAD IS A BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLE OF SCIENTIFIC APPLICATION—THELAWS OF PHYSICS SET INTO POETIC MOTION.[../Images/2.jpg]P R I N C I P L E S B E H I N D T H E S T R A I G H T L E A DAS WE DIVE INTO THIS CHAPTER ON MECHANICS, ALWAYS KEEP IN MIND WHAT BRUCE LISTEDAS “THE ESSENTIAL QUALITIES OF THE LEAD PUNCH”:[../Images/a.jpg] ECONOMY OF FORM[../Images/a.jpg] ACCURACY[../Images/a.jpg] SPEED[../Images/a.jpg] EXPLOSIVE POWER1[../Images/2.jpg]G R E A T E R T H A N T H E S U M O F I T S P A R T SYOU’LL ALSO WANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE END FORCE PRODUCTION OF THE STRAIGHTLEAD IS GREATER THAN THE SUM OF ITS PARTS. THE IDEA IS THAT LESS MOVEMENT EQUALSLESS TIME AND ENERGY. YOU NEVER WANT ANY SINGLE BODY PART TO TRAVEL MORE THAN ITHAS TO. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU THROW AN ARM PUNCH, NOT ONLY WILL YOU HAVE LESSPOWER WITHOUT YOUR BODY WEIGHT BEHIND IT, BUT YOU’LL ALSO BE SLOWER, NOT TOMENTION MORE FATIGUED. IF YOU’RE ONLY USING ONE SET OF MUSCLES, THEY’RE GOING TOGET TIRED A LOT FASTER THAN IF YOU RECRUIT OTHER MUSCLES TO HELP OUT.THAT’S WHY THE FEET AND HIPS ARE SO IMPORTANT IN THE STRAIGHT LEAD. YOUR ARM CANONLY MOVE SO FAST BY ITSELF. BUT IF THE HAND COVERS SOME DISTANCE AND YOUR FEETALSO COVER DISTANCE, YOU’LL GET THERE A LOT FASTER. AND AS YOU’LL SEE SHORTLY,ROTATING THE HIPS WILL GIVE YOU EVEN MORE ACCELERATION, AND MORE ACCELERATIONMEANS ADDITIONAL FORCE.[../Images/2.jpg]T H E K I N E T I C C H A I NTHE PRINCIPLE THAT THE FORCE BEHIND A PUNCH SHOULD BE GREATER THAN THE SUM OFITS PARTS IS WHAT THE WORLD OF BIOMECHANICS REFERS TO AS THE KINETIC CHAIN. WHATI CALL THE “SCIENCE OF HOW TO BEST THROW YOUR WEIGHT AROUND” IS NOTHING NEW TOTHE WORLD OF SPORTS, AND THE SEQUENCE OF HOW TO BEST ACCOMPLISH THIS IS WHAT WECALL THE KINETIC CHAIN. THE KINETIC CHAIN IS THE COORDINATED ACTIVATION OF BODYSEGMENTS IN SUCH A WAY AS TO GENERATE MAXIMUM VELOCITY, FORCE, OR SOME OTHERDESIRED OUTCOME. SEE FIGURE 46.THIS PRINCIPLE CAN BE APPLIED TO ANY ATHLETIC TECHNIQUE: THE FOOTBALL PASS, AGOLF SWING, A BASEBALL PITCH, A VOLLEYBALL SERVE, SOCCER’S INSTEP KICK, AND,YES, THE STRAIGHT LEAD.APPLIED TO THE STRAIGHT LEAD, THE PURPOSE OF THE KINETIC CHAIN IS TO PLACE THEEND SEGMENT, THE HAND, IN THE BEST POSITION TO GENERATE OPTIMUM VELOCITY, WHICHIN TURN, GENERATES MAXIMUM FORCE. THE CORRECT BODY SEGMENT ACTIVATION RESULTS INGENERATION OF A FORCE THAT IS GREATER THAN THE SUM OF ITS PARTS. THIS IS WHY WEDISCOURAGE “ARM PUNCHING.” IT’S AN INEFFICIENT WAY OF THROWING A PUNCH. IT’SSLOWER AND GENERATES MINIMAL FORCE. YOUR ARM CAN ONLY GENERATE SO MUCH FORCE BYITSELF. BUT BY PUSHING FROM THE GROUND UP AND ROTATING THE TRUNK, YOU ARE ABLETO SEND ALL OF YOUR BODY WEIGHT BEHIND YOUR ARM. THIS IS TRUE OF MECHANICS INALL SPORTS.[../Images/2.jpg]T H E S E Q U E N C EWHEN IT COMES TO EXECUTING PUNCHES AND KICKS, JKD TRULY IS THE SCIENCE OF HOW TOBEST THROW YOUR WEIGHT AROUND. PUNCHES SHOULD BE, AS BRUCE NOTED, “NOT JUST ARMPOWER—STRIKE WITH CORRECT TIMING OF FOOT, WAIST, AND HIP, SHOULDER, AND WRISTMOTION.”2[../Images/76a.jpg]FIGURE 46: THERE’S A LOT MORE TO HOOK PUNCHES THAN JUST ARM POWER.NOTE THE PHRASE “CORRECT TIMING.” TO AVOID MERE ARM PUNCHING, WE MUST FOLLOW ANINTRICATE SEQUENCE OF STEPS IN THROWING THE STRAIGHT LEAD. ESSENTIALLY, THESTRAIGHT LEAD CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS SIX SPECIFIC STEPS IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER:1. THE HAND2. THE PUSH-OFF3. HIP ROTATION AND SHOULDER EXTENSION4. CONTACT WITH TARGET5. LANDING OF FRONT FOOT6. LANDING OF REAR FOOT AND HAND RETRACTIONNOW LET’S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT EACH OF THESE STEPS. AT TIMES, WE WILL HAVE TOBREAK THEM UP, BECAUSE CERTAIN STEPS OVERLAP EACH OTHER.S T E P O N E : H A N D B E F O R E F O O T, A L W A Y STHE STRAIGHT LEAD IS THE MOST DIFFICULT TECHNIQUE IN JKD, AND, FITTINGLY, THEVERY FIRST MOTION OF THIS PUNCH IS THE MOST DIFFICULT STEP TO MASTER. THE HANDMUST MOVE BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE, WHICH IS A VERY UNNATURAL MOTION. WHEN WE RUN,FOR EXAMPLE, WE ARE USED TO SYNCHRONIZATION OF OUR ARMS AND LEGS. THIS IS NOTTHE CASE WITH THE STRAIGHT LEAD.3THE CONCEPT OF “HAND BEFORE FOOT” HAS ITS ROOTS IN FENCING. BRUCE TOOK HIS CUESFROM NADI WHO WROTE, “THE ARM MUST EXTEND BEFORE THE RIGHT FOOT MOVES FOR THEEXECUTION OF THE LUNGE—A RULE THAT MUST REMAIN ENGRAVED IN YOUR MIND FOREVER.HAND BEFORE FOOT, ALWAYS.”4 YOU’LL FIND BRUCE’S REFERENCING OF NADI IN THE TAOOF JEET KUNE DO: “ONE IMPORTANT POINT: IN ALL HAND TECHNIQUES, THE HAND MOVESFIRST, PRECEDING THE FOOT. KEEP THIS IN MIND— HAND BEFORE FOOT —ALWAYS.5THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS FOR NADI’S INSISTENCE. THE FIRST IS A MATTER OF SPEED.YOU WILL ALWAYS BE ABLE TO MOVE YOUR HAND AND ARM FASTER THAN YOUR LEGS ORTRUNK, RESULTING IN A PUNCH THAT WILL REACH ITS TARGET SOONER. SEE FIGURES 47AND 48.[../Images/77a.jpg]FIGURE 47: STARTING POINT FROM STANCE.THIS WOULD BE A GOOD TIME TO INTRODUCE NEWTON’S FIRST LAW OF MOTION, WHICHSTATES THAT AN OBJECT AT REST OR MOVING UNIFORMLY AT THE SAME SPEED, IN ASTRAIGHT LINE WILL CONTINUE IN THAT STATE UNLESS FORCES ACT UPON IT. IN JKD,WHEN WE ARE AT REST IN THE STANCE, WE ARE IN A STATE OF INERTIA. MUSCULAR FORCESCAUSE US TO MOVE OUR HANDS AND FEET, SETTING US INTO MOTION AND ENABLING US TOOVERCOME INERTIA.[../Images/78a.jpg]FIGURE 48: THE LEAD HAND SHOULD ALREADY BE IN MOTION BEFORE THE FEET MOVE.NEWTON’S SECOND LAW OF MOTION SAYS THAT AN OBJECT’S ACCELERATION IS DIRECTLYPROPORTIONAL TO THE FORCE ACTING ON IT AND IS INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO ITSMASS. IN OTHER WORDS, THE LESS AN OBJECT’S MASS, THE EASIER IT IS TO ACCELERATETHAT OBJECT. SO, IF WE’RE IN THE JKD STANCE AT REST, IN A STATE OF INERTIA, ITWILL BE MUCH EASIER FOR US TO OVERCOME INERTIA AND ACCELERATE OUR HAND, WHICHHAS LESS MASS THAN OUR LARGER BODY PARTS—OUR TRUNK OR LEGS.NEWTON’S SECOND LAW IS EXPRESSED BY THE FOLLOWING EQUATION:FORCE = MASS X ACCELERATIONTHIS IS A CENTRAL PRINCIPLE OF JKD. AT 5'7\" AND ANYWHERE BETWEEN 126 AND 143POUNDS, BRUCE LEE WAS ABLE TO GENERATE MORE FORCE IN HIS PUNCHES AND KICKS THANMEN OF MUCH GREATER WEIGHT AND BODY MASS. THE EQUATION EXPLAINS HOW BRUCE MADEUP FOR HIS LACK IN STATURE WITH THE ABILITY TO ACCELERATE, TO CHANGE HIS SPEEDFROM ZERO TO GREASED LIGHTNING IN VERY LITTLE TIME.WHILE FOR BEGINNERS, “HAND BEFORE FOOT” MAY FEEL AWKWARD AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE,IT IS ACTUALLY A KEY ELEMENT IN GENERATING FORCE FOR THE STRAIGHT LEAD. GREATERACCELERATION OBVIOUSLY ALSO MEANS A BETTER CHANCE OF HITTING AN OPPONENT. HANDBEFORE FOOT ALSO MAKES THE JKD JAB HIGHLY DECEPTIVE. IF ONLY THE HAND MOVESINITIALLY, IT IS ALREADY HALFWAY TO THE TARGET BEFORE IT CAN BE DETECTED.THWACK! YOUR OPPONENT’S HEAD HAS ALREADY SNAPPED BACK BEFORE HE OR SHE HAS EVENREALIZED YOU’VE GOTTEN A SHOT OFF. THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT OF THE TRUNK ORLEGS—BOTH MADE TELEGRAPHIC BY THEIR LARGER SIZE, GREATER VISIBILITY, ANDDECREASED CAPACITY FOR ACCELERATION—BEFORE THE HAND HAS INITIATED THE PUNCH WILLGIVE YOU AWAY.WHILE HAND BEFORE FOOT IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF THE STRAIGHT LEAD,ATTEMPTING TO MASTER IT CAN BE MADDENING. WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO MOVING HAND WITHFOOT, AS IN WALKING AND RUNNING. IN THE BEGINNING, YOU MAY WANT TO WALK THROUGHTHE STRAIGHT LEAD MOVING YOUR HAND SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH YOUR FEET, GRADUALLYTRAINING YOUR LEAD HAND TO MOVE EVER SO SLIGHTLY BEFORE YOUR FEET. USE A MIRRORFOR VISUAL FEEDBACK. AS YOU PRACTICE, START OUT SLOWLY, TAKING TIME TO NOTE HOWTHE CORRECT SEQUENCE FEELS. EXECUTING TECHNIQUES IN JKD, LIKE ANY PHYSICALENDEAVOR, IS KINESTHETIC. BE PATIENT. LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE, IT’S ONLY A MATTEROF NEUROMUSCULAR PROGRAMMING.BE NONTELEGRAPHICTHE STRAIGHT LEAD IS ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS BECAUSE OF ITS NONTELEGRAPHICPROPERTIES. I’VE ALREADY MENTIONED THE ADVANTAGE OF USING THE LEAD HAND BECAUSEÅΩOF ITS PROXIMITY TO THE TARGET. THIS IS ONLY AN ADVANTAGE, THOUGH, IF IT ISEXECUTED PROPERLY. YOU SHOOT OUT YOUR FIST STRAIGHT AS AN ARROW FROM WHEREVER ITIS AND RETURN THE HAND ALONG THE EXACT SAME PATH. IN REMAINING CONSISTENT WITHTHE ROOTS OF JKD, BRUCE WROTE, “THE PUNCH SHOULD, AND THIS APPLIES TO ALLPUNCHES AND KICKS, START FROM THE READY STANCE WITHOUT ANY UNNECESSARYMOTIONS.”6 THIS MAY SOUND LIKE COMMON SENSE, BUT DEMPSEY SEEMED TO THINK THATBEING NONTELEGRAPHIC WAS A POINT WORTH EMPHASIZING REPEATEDLY.7 AS ALWAYS,STREAMLINING YOUR PUNCHES FROM START TO FINISH MAKES THEM HARDER TO READ ANDGIVES THEM MORE SPEED AND FORCE.S T E P T W O: T H E P U S H - O F FFOLLOWING THE FIST BY MERE MILLISECONDS ARE THE FEET. THIS IS THE PUSH-OFFMENTIONED IN THE CHAPTER ON FOOTWORK. IF A LARGE PART OF JKD IS THE SCIENCE OFHOW TO BEST THROW ONE’S WEIGHT AROUND, THE PUSH-OFF IS WHAT SETS THAT WEIGHTINTO MOTION. YOU’LL FIND NO DESCRIPTION OF THE PUSH-OFF MORE ELOQUENT THANNADI’S.> RAISING THE LEFT HEEL EVER SO LITTLE, YOU COCK THE LEG READY TO PULL THE> TRIGGER AND GO INTO ACTION. YOU TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF ONE OF THE MIGHTIEST> SPRINGS IN ALL CREATION, THE ARCH OF THE FOOT, WHICH IN THE LUNGE RELEASES ITS> TREMENDOUS POWER THROUGH THE PRESSURE EXERTED ON THE GROUND BY THE BALL OF THE> FOOT ITSELF.8SOUNDS A BIT DRAMATIC, DOESN’T IT? THE IMPORTANCE, THOUGH, OF THE LEFT LEG, ANDMORE SPECIFICALLY, THAT RESILIENT LITTLE LEFT ARCH IN JKD CANNOT BEOVEREMPHASIZED. THE LEFT ARCH IS WHAT INITIATES THE PUSH-OFF. IT DETERMINES HOWFAST YOU CAN FIRE OFF A PUNCH AND THE FORCE WITH WHICH YOU WILL FIRE.THERE ARE A FEW THINGS TO REMEMBER THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN ADDRESSED IN THESTANCE CHAPTER. ONE, YOU WANT TO FEEL ALL THE WEIGHT ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LEGS.THAT’S WHERE THE POTENTIAL ENERGY SHOULD BE. MORE SPECIFICALLY, ALL THE WEIGHT,TENSION, AND POTENTIAL ENERGY SHOULD BE DIRECTED TOWARD AND CONCENTRATED IN THEBALL OF YOUR LEFT FOOT. GOING BACK TO NEWTON’S THIRD LAW, THE FORCE YOU EXERT ONTHE GROUND EXERTS AN EQUAL AND OPPOSITE FORCE UP THROUGH YOUR FOOT. THIS IS HOWYOU ARE PUSHED OFF THE GROUND. IN BIOMECHANICS WE CALL THIS GROUND REACTIONFORCE.9IF THE PRESSURE YOU EXERT IS DISSIPATED AND NOT CONCENTRATED—IF, FOR EXAMPLE,SOME OF YOUR WEIGHT IS ROLLING TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE LEFT (REAR) LEG OR FOOT,YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE EXTRA INERTIA TO OVERCOME ON THE TAKE-OFF. IT’LL SLOW YOUDOWN. SEE FIGURE 49.[../Images/80a.jpg]FIGURE 49: PART 1 OF THE PUSH-OFF: LAUNCHING OFF THE LEFT FOOT.TWO, YOU WANT TO HAVE A CONTROLLED PUSH-OFF. AGAIN, BRUCE EMPHASIZED SMALL,CONTROLLED STEPS. YOU NEVER WANT TO SACRIFICE DISTANCE FOR BALANCE. KEEP IN MINDTHAT YOU ALWAYS WANT TO RETAIN THE INTEGRITY OF THE STANCE. YOU ARE ESSENTIALLYMOVING FROM POINT A TO POINT B WITHOUT UPSETTING THE ON-GUARD POSITION.ALSO REMEMBER THAT THE PUSH-OFF IS A TAKE-OFF. YOU ARE UNLEASHING ALL THATPOTENTIAL ENERGY STORED IN YOUR LEFT LEG. NOTE THE POWER TO WHICH NADI REFERREDAND THE “EXPLOSIVE” POWER DESCRIBED BY JACK DEMPSEY, AND LATER, BRUCE.IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE ACCELERATE THE LEAD HAND, WE WANT TO ACCELERATE OURENTIRE BODY WEIGHT TO GENERATE POWER. TO DO SO, INTENSITY AND EXPLOSIVENESS AREREQUIRED, STARTING FROM THE GROUND.A SLIGHT LEAN: CHEATING INERTIABEFORE WE MOVE ON TO HIP ROTATION IT’S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THERE’S MORE TOTHE PUSH-OFF THAN JUST THE ACTUAL PUSH. REMEMBER FROM NEWTON’S FIRST LAW, WENEED TO OVERCOME INERTIA IN ORDER TO LAUNCH INTO THE STRAIGHT LEAD. IN GENERAL,YOUR WEIGHT IS DISTRIBUTED 50-50 BETWEEN YOUR RIGHT AND LEFT LEG. BUT WHEN YOUARE POISED TO THROW A STRAIGHT LEAD, YOU ACTUALLY CHEAT INERTIA A LITTLE BYSHIFTING YOUR WEIGHT EVER SO SLIGHTLY TO THE LEAD LEG, AND YOU’LL REQUIRE LESSFORCE TO PROPEL YOUR BODY WEIGHT INTO THE PUNCH.THE SHIFT IS ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE. THERE IS A SLIGHT TURN AT THE LEFT HIP, ANDWITH THIS TURN COMES A TINY EXTENSION OF THE LEFT KNEE. THE LEFT HEEL WILL BERAISED AN ADDITIONAL INCH OR TWO. THIS OPENS UP THE STANCE AND SHIFTS THE WEIGHTFORWARD. AGAIN, IT IS ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE, BUT WITH YOUR WEIGHT ALREADY SHIFTEDIN THE DIRECTION YOU PLAN TO MOVE, IT WILL BE A LITTLE EASIER TO OVERCOMEINERTIA AND PROPEL YOUR BODY FORWARD. SEE FIGURES 50 THROUGH 53.THIS TINY SHIFT IS LIKE COCKING A GUN. YOU EMPLOY IT ONLY WHEN YOU’RE JUST ABOUTREADY TO FIRE. ALSO NOTE THIS SHIFT IS JUST ENOUGH TO GIVE YOU AN EDGE OVERINERTIA BUT NOT SO MUCH AS TO UPSET YOUR BALANCE.YOU’LL FIND EVIDENCE FOR THE SLIGHT LEAN IN THE TAO OF JEET KUNE DO IN WHICHBRUCE MENTIONS MAINTAINING A “SLIGHTLY FORWARD CENTER OF GRAVITY.”10[../Images/81a.jpg]FIGURE 50: STARTING FROM THE STANCE.[../Images/82a.jpg]FIGURE 51: THE SLIGHT LEAN. THE LEFT HEEL IS SLIGHTLY RAISED, CAUSING YOURWEIGHT TO SHIFT FORWARD.[../Images/82b.jpg]FIGURE 52: STARTING POSITION.[../Images/83a.jpg]FIGURE 53: WHEN YOU LEAN FORWARD, YOU’LL ALSO TURN SLIGHTLY TO YOUR RIGHT. THISSLIGHTLY OPENS THE STANCE AND GIVES YOU MORE ROOM FOR HIP ROTATION.WAYS TO DIRECT MOTIONNOW WOULD BE A GOOD TIME TO DISCUSS THE THREE DIRECTIONS OF MOTION INVOLVED INTHROWING ANY PUNCH. FIRST, WE HAVE LINEAR HORIZONTAL MOTION, MOTION ALONG ASTRAIGHT-LINE PATH. IN JKD, THIS MEANS MOVING FORWARD OR BACKWARD. THE SECONDDIRECTION IS LINEAR VERTICAL MOTION —IN THE SIMPLEST TERMS, UP AND DOWN RELATIVETO THE EARTH’S SURFACE. JUMPING UP AND DOWN IS AN EXAMPLE OF VERTICAL MOTION. SOIS THE LEGWORK INVOLVED IN THROWING AN UPPERCUT. FINALLY, WE HAVE ROTATIONALMOTION, DEFINED AS CIRCULAR MOVEMENT ABOUT AN AXIS. THINK OF A DOOR SWINGING ONA HINGE.WE’LL COME BACK TO THE PUSH-OFF, DIRECTIONS OF MOTION, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF ACORRECTLY TIMED LANDING SHORTLY. BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT, WE NEED TO DISCUSS HIPROTATION AND SHOULDER EXTENSION.S T E P T H R E E : H I P R O T A T I O N A N D S H O U L D E R E X T E NS I O NFOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE THIRD STEP IN THROWING A STRAIGHT LEAD, I’LL NEED TODESCRIBE A PARTICULAR TYPE OF MOTION THAT PHYSICISTS CALL PROJECTILE MOTION. APROJECTILE IS DEFINED AS ANY OBJECT THAT MOVES THROUGH THE AIR OR THROUGH SPACE,ACTED ON ONLY BY GRAVITY.11 IF WE WERE TO SHOOT AN ARROW STRAIGHT AHEAD, ITWOULD FOLLOW A CURVED PATH DOWNWARD AND WOULD EVENTUALLY HIT THE GROUND. THISDOWNWARD MOTION IS A RESULT OF GRAVITY, WHICH EXERTS VERTICAL FORCE DOWNWARD ONTHE ARROW. IF IT WEREN’T FOR GRAVITY, THE ARROW WOULD CONTINUE FOREVER IN ASTRAIGHT PATH. BECAUSE OF GRAVITY, HOWEVER, IT IS ACTUALLY MOVING IN TWODIRECTIONS—STRAIGHT AHEAD IN A HORIZONTAL PATH AND DOWNWARD TOWARD THE EARTH’SSURFACE. AS IT IS BEING PULLED TOWARD THE GROUND, THE SPEED AT WHICH IT TRAVELSHORIZONTALLY IS SLOWED. WHEN YOU THROW THE STRAIGHT LEAD, YOUR BODY FOLLOWS ASIMILAR CURVED PATH. THE TRAJECTORY OF ANY PROJECTILE IS SHOWN IN FIGURE 54.[../Images/84a.jpg]FIGURE 54: TRAJECTORY OF PROJECTILE MOTION.WHEN THROWING A STRAIGHT LEAD, ROTATION OF THE HIP HELPS TO COMPENSATE FOR THISEFFECT OF GRAVITY. FIRST, IT ENABLES YOU TO INCREASE YOUR ACCELERATION TOWARDTHE TARGET. ONCE YOU HAVE THROWN OUT YOUR LEAD HAND AND PUSHED OFF THE GROUND,GRAVITY IS GOING TO SLOW YOU DOWN AS IT DRAGS YOU TOWARD THE GROUND. BUT THISISN’T WHAT WE WANT! TO GENERATE THE MOST FORCE, YOU NEED TO CONTINUE TOACCELERATE.TO ACHIEVE THIS, YOU ROTATE YOUR TORSO. THIS IS WHERE TED WONG USES THE ANALOGYOF A WAVE. IF YOU’VE EVER WATCHED WAVES AT THE BEACH, YOU’LL NOTICE A WAVE MIGHTSTART OUT BY ITSELF AND THEN JOIN ANOTHER. AND THAT BIGGER WAVE, WHICH WASORIGINALLY TWO, MIGHT JOIN YET ANOTHER AND SO ON. YOU’LL ALSO NOTICE THAT THATONE BIG WAVE CONTINUES TO PICK UP SPEED AS IT APPROACHES THE BEACH. EACH SMALLERONE BRINGS A MOMENTUM AND ACCELERATION OF ITS OWN, ADDING TO THE LARGER WAVE’SACCELERATION. THAT GNARLY BOMBORA GATHERS IN SPEED WITH EACH SMALLER WAVE ITPICKS UP UNTIL IT EVENTUALLY CRASHES ONTO THE SHORE.12THIS IS THE PRINCIPLE BEHIND THE SEQUENCE OF THE STRAIGHT LEAD. WE WANT TO PICKUP SPEED WITH EACH STEP. FIRST, THE HAND SHOOTS OUT. THEN WE PUSH OFF. IN THESECOND HALF OF THE PUSH-OFF, AS WE ARE BEING DRAGGED DOWN BY GRAVITY, A QUICKTURN OF THE HIPS ALLOWS US TO GATHER SPEED JUST BEFORE WE MAKE CONTACT WITH THETARGET.ACCELERATION ISN’T THE ONLY BENEFIT OF HIP ROTATION. ONE OF THE KEY PRINCIPLESOF JKD IS THAT IN ANY PUNCH OR KICK, YOU WANT YOUR HIPS TO MOVE TOWARD THETARGET SO THAT, AT IMPACT, THE HIP IS POINTING TOWARD IT. THIS HAS TO DO, AGAIN,WITH THE SCIENCE OF HOW TO BEST THROW YOUR WEIGHT AROUND. MOST OF YOUR WEIGHT ISLOCATED IN YOUR TRUNK. ROTATE YOUR TRUNK, AND YOU’RE ABLE TO DIRECT MOST OF YOURBODY WEIGHT INTO A PUNCH.THE PRINCIPLE IS TRUE OF JUST ABOUT ANY SPORT. IN BASEBALL, THE FORCE OF YOURSWING DEPENDS LARGELY ON THE TORQUE YOU GENERATE WITH YOUR HIPS. AS TENNISTECHNIQUE HAS BECOME MORE SOPHISTICATED, PLAYERS HAVE SWITCHED FROM A CLOSEDFOREHAND STANCE TO AN OPEN STANCE TO ALLOW FOR GREATER HIP ROTATION. IN JOEMONTANA’S ART AND MAGIC OF QUARTERBACKING, HE DISCUSSES HOW HE USES HIS BODY TOTHROW PASSES AS OPPOSED TO JUST USING HIS ARM. HE GOES ON TO EXPLAIN HOW PROPERMECHANICS SAVED HIS ARM AND LENGTHENED HIS CAREER.13 THE SAME GOES FOR JKD. WENEVER WANT TO ARM-PUNCH. AS DEMPSEY EMPHASIZED THROUGHOUT HIS BOOK, THE KEY TOFORCEFUL PUNCHES IS KNOWING HOW TO USE YOUR BODY WEIGHT.AS SHOWN IN THE CHAPTER ON THE STANCE, ROTATION OF THE HIPS ALSO PUTS US IN THEBEST ALIGNMENT TO ABSORB FORCES COMING BACK TO US, AGAIN, SAVING SOME WEAR ANDTEAR ON OUR JOINTS. AND IF THAT WEREN’T ENOUGH, THAT LITTLE EXTRA HIP TURN GIVESUS A FEW CRITICAL INCHES OF EXTENDED REACH.YOU’LL WANT TO “PUT YOUR SHOULDER” INTO THE PUNCH WHEN YOU ROTATE YOUR HIPS.FULLY EXTEND AT THE SHOULDER, BUT BEWARE. DO NOT ADD EXTRA LINEAR REACH BYSTRAIGHTENING YOUR LEGS. THIS IS A VERY COMMON MISTAKE. PEOPLE TEND TO THINKTHAT BECAUSE THE LEAD PUNCH IS DIRECTED LINEARLY TOWARD THE TARGET, ALL THEPOWER MUST COME FROM LINEAR MECHANISMS. WRONG. THE ROTATION OF YOUR TRUNK ISCRITICAL TO GENERATING FORCE. THE LINEAR PORTION OF THE PUNCH IS MAINLYCONTROLLED BY EXTENSION OF THE HAND AND THE PUSH-OFF.14 SEE FIGURES 55 AND 56.[../Images/85a.jpg]FIGURE 55: DO NOT TRY TO ADD POWER BY STRAIGHTENING YOUR KNEE AND REACHINGFORWARD. WHEN YOUR TORSO OVERTAKES YOUR KNEE, YOU LOSE BALANCE AND LEVERAGE.[../Images/86a.jpg]FIGURE 56: CORRECT HIP ROTATION AND SHOULDER EXTENSION. THE CENTER OF GRAVITY ISKEPT LOW AND IS WELL WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES DETERMINED BY BOTH FEET.SO WHEN ROTATING YOUR HIPS AND EXTENDING THE SHOULDER, MAKE SURE YOU MAINTAINTHE INTEGRITY OF YOUR STANCE. KEEP YOUR CENTER OF GRAVITY LOW, AND MAINTAIN THEBEND AND GIVE IN YOUR KNEES. A TRICK I LIKE TO USE IS TO LOOK AT THE STRIPES ONMY PANTS. THE STRIPES SHOULD TURN WHILE YOUR LEGS REMAIN BENT AT THE KNEES.OTHER THAN A SLIGHT FORWARD LEAN, YOUR TORSO DOES NOT MOVE FORWARD. SEE FIGURES57 AND 58.[../Images/86b.jpg]FIGURE 57: STARTING POSITION. NOTE WHERE MY PANT STRIPES ARE.[../Images/87a.jpg]FIGURE 58: ROTATION WITH SHOULDER AND ARM EXTENSION. MY PANT STRIPES SHOULD NOWBE FACING THE TARGET, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, MY TORSO NEVER OVERTAKES MY FRONTKNEE.ROTATIONAL MOTION PLAYS A MUCH LARGER PART IN OTHER PUNCHES, LIKE THE HOOK, BUTIT IS A CRITICAL ELEMENT IN THROWING ALL PUNCHES, INCLUDING AN EFFECTIVESTRAIGHT LEAD.[../Images/2.jpg]S T E P F O U R : W E H A V E C O N T A C T!T H E S T R A I G H T L E A D A T I M P A C TFROM THE CHAPTER ON THE STANCE, YOU ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THE POWER LINE AND WHYIT’S SO IMPORTANT TO LAND WITH THE BOTTOM THREE KNUCKLES AT IMPACT. YOU’LL NOTONLY ADD MORE FORCE TO YOUR PUNCHES, BUT YOU’LL ALSO GREATLY REDUCE THE RISK OFHAND AND WRIST INJURIES. A FEW THINGS YOU NEED TO KEEP IN MIND AT THE VERYMOMENT OF IMPACT ARE DISTANCE, ACCURACY, AND FOLLOW-THROUGH.LEVERAGEKNOWING HOW TO THROW A STRAIGHT LEAD IS OF LITTLE USE IF WE AREN’T IN THE PROPERPOSITION. OBVIOUSLY, IF WE’RE TOO FAR FROM THE TARGET, WE CAN’T REACH IT. LESSOBVIOUS IS THAT BEING TOO CLOSE IS ALMOST AS BAD. IF YOU JAM YOURSELF, YOU LOSELEVERAGE. AS AN EXAMPLE, CONSIDER THE BENCH PRESS. LIFTING EARLY INTO A SINGLEREP IS HARDER THAN LIFTING THE LAST 3–4 INCHES. AS YOU STRAIGHTEN YOUR ARMS FORTHOSE LAST FEW INCHES, YOU HAVE THE MOST LEVERAGE. THE SAME IS TRUE OF THESTRAIGHT LEAD. YOU’LL WANT TO HAVE ABOUT 3–4 INCHES LEFT TO EXTEND AT THE ELBOWWHEN YOUR FIST ACTUALLY TOUCHES THE TARGET. THIS IS WHERE YOU WILL HAVE THE MOSTLEVERAGE, AND YOU WANT THAT POINT TO BE AT THE VERY MOMENT YOU MAKE CONTACT. TOMAXIMIZE LEVERAGE, THEN, YOU NEED TO MAINTAIN PROPER DISTANCE FROM THE TARGET.SEE FIGURES 59 AND 60.[../Images/88a.jpg]FIGURE 59: CORRECT ARM POSITION AT IMPACT ALLOWS OPTIMAL LEVERAGE.[../Images/88b.jpg]FIGURE 60: YOU SHOULD HAVE JUST ENOUGH BEND IN YOUR ARM AT IMPACT TO ALLOW FOR AFOLLOW-THROUGH OF ABOUT 3 INCHES PAST THE TARGET.ACCURACYUP TO THIS POINT, WE’VE INITIATED THE STRAIGHT LEAD BY SHOOTING THE HAND OUTBEFORE MOVING OUR FEET. WE’VE EXPLODED OFF THE GROUND WITH THE PUSH-OFF. WE’VEINCREASED THE SPEED OF OUR HAND AND LAUNCHED OUR BODY WEIGHT INTO THE PUNCH BYROTATING OUR TRUNK AND SHOULDERS, AND WE’VE PERFECTLY JUDGED OUR DISTANCE. BUTALL OF THIS IS WORTH VERY LITTLE IF WE MISS THE TARGET. TO THROW AN EFFECTIVEPUNCH, YOU MUST DIRECT ALL OF YOUR SPEED, ENERGY, FORM, ALIGNMENT, AND BODYWEIGHT TOWARD ONE LITTLE POINT THAT CULMINATES AT THOSE BOTTOM THREE KNUCKLES OFYOUR HAND.THIS IS WHERE FOCUS MITT DRILLS ARE INVALUABLE. UNLIKE THE HEAVY BAG, WHEN ITCOMES TO ACCURACY, THE FOCUS MITTS DON’T LIE. YOU’LL WANT TO LAND SQUARELY ONTHAT LITTLE DOT—IT’S THERE FOR A REASON—EVERY TIME. NO SKIDDING OFF THE MITT. NOWOBBLING MITTS. YOU’LL KNOW WHEN YOU LAND A GOOD ONE. YOU’LL FEEL IT. OF COURSE,YOU WON’T WANT YOUR EYES RIVETED TO A POTENTIAL TARGET ALL THE TIME. BUT YOU DOWANT TO FOCUS YOUR EYES LIKE A LASER ON THE TARGET DURING THOSE MILLISECONDSPRIOR TO IMPACT.LIKEWISE, YOUR HAND SHOULD BE COMPLETELY RELAXED RIGHT UP TO THE MOMENT BEFOREHITTING THE TARGET. BEING UNNECESSARILY TENSE WASTES ENERGY AND SLOWS YOU DOWN.THINK ABOUT IT. ONCE YOU SEE THE TARGET, YOU HAVE TO OVERCOME THAT TENSION ANDRELAX YOUR MUSCLES FIRST, SO THAT YOU CAN MOVE THEM. YOU CAN ELIMINATE THIS STEPBY BEING RELAXED IN THE FIRST PLACE. EASIER SAID THAN DONE, I KNOW. JUST DON’TFORGET TO WORK ON IT.AS FOR FIST CLENCHING, REMEMBER THAT IT DOESN’T OCCUR UNTIL JUST BEFOREIMPACT.15 AS IS ALWAYS THE CASE—MUSCLES SHOULD ONLY BE ACTIVATED WHEN THEY ARENEEDED. OTHERWISE, YOU WASTE ENERGY AND RESTRICT YOUR ABILITY TO MOVE QUICKLY.FOLLOW -THROUGHTHE FINAL STAGE OF MAKING CONTACT WITH A TARGET IS FOLLOW-THROUGH. HERE, BRUCEWAS INFLUENCED BY HAISLET:> A BLOW IS NEVER HIT AT A MARK. IT IS DRIVEN THROUGH A MARK. FOLLOW-THROUGH IS> JUST AS IMPORTANT IN FIGHTING AS IT IS IN ANY OTHER SPORT AND FOLLOW-THROUGH> CAN ONLY BE OBTAINED BY PUNCHING THROUGH AND BEYOND THE POINT OF ATTACK.16THROWING A FOOTBALL, BASEBALL, SHOT PUT, OR FRISBEE. THE GOLF SWING. TENNISSERVE, BACKHAND, FOREHAND. THEY ALL END WITH FOLLOW-THROUGH. THE STRAIGHT LEADIS NO DIFFERENT. ALWAYS KEEP IN MIND THAT YOU’LL WANT TO PUNCH THROUGH THETARGET ABOUT 3–4 INCHES PAST THE POINT OF CONTACT.THIS IS WHERE MOMENTUM COMES INTO PLAY. I’LL DEFINE AND DISCUSS MOMENTUM IN MOREDETAIL IN THE NEXT SECTION. FOR NOW, JUST KNOW THAT WE DON’T WANT TO DECREASEOUR MOMENTUM BEFORE CONTACT. WE WANT TO MAXIMIZE USE OF THAT BODY WEIGHT AT THEPOINT OF CONTACT. YOUR MOMENTUM WILL CARRY YOU INTO FOLLOW-THROUGH.S T E P F I V E : L A N D I N G O F T H E F R O N T F O O TWHAT GOES UP MUST COME DOWN: THE SECOND HALF OF THE PUSH -OFFROTATION OF THE HIPS IS CONSIDERED THE FINAL STEP BEFORE CONTACT WITH THETARGET, BUT AS THIS OCCURS, YOU WILL BE IN MID-AIR, ON YOUR WAY BACK DOWN TO THEGROUND IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE PUSH-OFF.RECALL THAT THE FIRST HALF OF THE PUSH-OFF SETS THE BODY IN TWO OF THESEDIRECTIONS—HORIZONTALLY (LINEAR) AND VERTICALLY (UPWARD). THE HORIZONTALLYLINEAR ASPECT OF THE PUSH-OFF IS VERY MUCH LIKE A FENCER’S LUNGE, PROPELLING THEBODY FORWARD IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TARGET. INTUITIVELY, THIS MAKES SENSE. ANOBJECT COMING TOWARD US IN A STRAIGHT LINE, SAY A FIST, CARRIES A CERTAIN FORCEWITH IT, AND WE ARE GOING TO GET OUT OF ITS WAY!LESS WELL UNDERSTOOD, HOWEVER, IS THE ROLE THAT VERTICAL MOTION PLAYS IN THESTRAIGHT LEAD AND HOW THE PUSH-OFF MAKES THIS VERTICAL MOTION POSSIBLE. AGAIN,WE TURN TO SCIENCE—AND, AGAIN, THE SCIENCE OF PROJECTILE MOTION. REMEMBER, APROJECTILE IS DEFINED AS ANY OBJECT THAT MOVES THROUGH THE AIR OR THROUGH SPACE,ACTED ON ONLY BY GRAVITY. RECALL THE CURVED PATH OF A CANNONBALL AS IT IS PULLEDTOWARD THE EARTH’S SURFACE BY GRAVITY.TO COMPENSATE FOR THIS GRAVITATIONAL EFFECT, WE SOMETIMES UPWARDLY LAUNCHPROJECTILES AS IN THE CASE OF AIMING A CANNONBALL OR THROWING A JAVELIN. NOTETHAT THE MORE UPWARDLY A PROJECTILE IS LAUNCHED, THE LESS HORIZONTAL DISTANCE ITCAN COVER. SO IT’S IMPORTANT TO FIND THE MOST EFFECTIVE VERTICAL LAUNCH FOR THEPUSH-OFF. IN THIS CASE, IT IS JUST A SLIGHTLY UPWARD LAUNCH. MORE THAN THAT, ANDYOU WILL SACRIFICE THE LINEAR DISTANCE YOU ARE ABLE TO COVER.IN THE CASE OF THE PUSH-OFF, YOUR BODY IS ESSENTIALLY A PROJECTILE AS YOUR LEFTLEG LAUNCHES YOU BOTH IN A LINEAR AND UPWARD DIRECTION. FOR PRACTICAL PURPOSES,WE MUST LAUNCH OURSELVES SLIGHTLY UPWARD BECAUSE MERELY MOVING IN A LINEARDIRECTION WOULD MEAN THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO SLIDE TOWARD OUR OPPONENT, AND THEFRICTION OF THE GROUND WOULD SLOW US DOWN, REDUCING OUR ACCELERATION, AND, THUS,FORCE—NOT TO MENTION SEVERELY SCUFFING OUR SHOES.BUT THE PUSH-OFF SERVES A LESS OBVIOUS PURPOSE IN THAT IT IS AN ADDITIONAL MEANSOF GENERATING FORCE FOR THE STRAIGHT LEAD. IF THE INITIAL HALF OF THE PUSH-OFF,THE LAUNCH, COMES FROM NADI AND THE FENCING LUNGE, THE LATTER HALF OF THEPUSH-OFF, THE LANDING, HAS ITS ROOTS IN OLD-TIME FISTIC SCIENCE.THE FALLING STEPWHILE YOU WON’T FIND MANY DIRECT JACK DEMPSEY QUOTES IN THE TAO OF JEET KUNE DOOR BRUCE LEE’S COMMENTARIES ON THE MARTIAL WAY, DEMPSEY’S INFLUENCE ON THESTRAIGHT LEAD WAS ENORMOUS—FROM THE THUMBS UP FIST, THREE-KNUCKLE LANDING, ANDPOWER LINE TO THE HAND-BEFORE-FOOT LANDING AND FALLING STEP. IN HIS OWN COPY OFDEMPSEY’S CHAMPIONSHIP FIGHTING: EXPLOSIVE PUNCHING AND AGGRESSIVE DEFENCE,BRUCE HAD MARKED ENTIRE PASSAGES THAT WOULD BECOME MAJOR INFLUENCES ON JEET KUNEDO.17ONE OF DEMPSEY’S MAIN ARGUMENTS WAS THAT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF BODY MASS ANDGRAVITY COULD INCREASE PUNCHING FORCE. BECAUSE OF GRAVITY, WHAT GOES UP MUSTCOME DOWN. AND SO WITH THE PUSH-OFF: ONCE YOU HAVE LAUNCHED YOURSELF SLIGHTLYUPWARD, YOU MUST EVENTUALLY COME DOWN. THIS IS THE PRINCIPLE BEHIND THE FALLINGSTEP.REMEMBER THE EQUATION FOR FORCE PRODUCTION IS EXPRESSED AS:FORCE = MASS X ACCELERATIONPOWERFUL PUNCHES, THEN, ARE THE PRODUCT OF SETTING YOUR BODY WEIGHT INTO “FASTMOTION”—IN OTHER WORDS, ACCELERATING BODY MASS. IN A PASSAGE HEAVILY UNDERLINEDBY BRUCE LEE, DEMPSEY STATED:> THERE ARE FOUR WAYS OF SETTING THE BODY-WEIGHT IN MOTION FOR PUNCHING: (1)> FALLING FORWARD; (2) SPRINGING FORWARD; (3) WHIRLING THE SHOULDERS BY MEANS OF> THE POWERFUL BACK MUSCLES, ASSISTED BY SHIFTING WEIGHT FROM ONE LEG TO THE> OTHER, AND (4) BY SURGING UPWARDS, AS IN DELIVERING UPPERCUTS. EVERY PUNCH> COMBINES AT LEAST TWO OF THOSE MOTION-METHODS.18WHAT DEMPSEY HAS DESCRIBED HERE ARE THE THREE DIRECTIONS OF MOTION DISCUSSEDEARLIER. FALLING FORWARD WOULD BE A COMBINATION OF VERTICAL AND LINEAR MOTION.SPRINGING FORWARD WOULD BE LINEAR. “WHIRLING” IS A ROTATIONAL MOTION. AND“SURGING UPWARDS” IS MOVEMENT IN A VERTICAL DIRECTION.DEMPSEY ARGUED THAT EVERY PUNCH COMBINES AT LEAST TWO OF THESE MOTIONS. PART OFWHAT MAKES THE STRAIGHT LEAD SO DIFFICULT IS THAT IT INVOLVES ALL OF THEM. IWILL DISCUSS “WHIRLING,” OR ROTATIONAL MOTION, LATER, BUT LET’S GET BACK TO THEPUSH-OFF. I’VE ALREADY NOTED THAT THE PUSH-OFF IS A COMBINATION OF “SURGINGUPWARDS” AND “SPRINGING FORWARD.” WHAT WE HAVEN’T DISCUSSED IS WHAT DEMPSEYLISTED AS THE FIRST METHOD OF SETTING THE BODY IN MOTION, “FALLING FORWARD.” YOUMIGHT SAY THAT THE FIRST HALF OF THE JKD PUSH-OFF—MOVING UPWARD AND FORWARD—ISNADI INFLUENCED, AND THE SECOND HALF OF THE PUSH-OFF—MOVING DOWNWARD ANDFORWARD—COMES FROM DEMPSEY.REMEMBER OUR DISCUSSION OF PROJECTILE MOTION AND THE CURVED PATH A PROJECTILEMUST TAKE AS IT IS ACTED ON BY GRAVITY? THE UPWARD LAUNCH OF THE PUSH-OFF IS THEFIRST HALF OF THAT CURVED PATH. AS A PROJECTILE APPROACHES THE GROUND, THESECOND HALF OF THAT CURVED PATH IS WHAT DEMPSEY REFERRED TO AS “THE FALLINGSTEP.”ESSENTIALLY, WHAT WE ARE DOING WITH THE FALLING STEP IS MAKING GRAVITY WORK FORUS. IF GRAVITY IS GOING TO EXERT A FORCE ON US ANYWAY, WHY NOT USE THAT EXTRAFORCE AND REDIRECT IT TOWARD OUR TARGET? DEMPSEY DEDICATED AN ENTIRE CHAPTER TOILLUSTRATING THE FALLING STEP, WHICH HE CALLED “THE GEM MOVEMENT OF STRAIGHTPUNCHING.” ACTUALLY, THE FALLING STEP AT THE END OF THE PUSH-OFF IS VERY MUCHLIKE WALKING. WALKING IS REALLY A SERIES OF FALLS. YOU LIFT ONE FOOT UP AND AREUNSTABLE FOR A MOMENT UNTIL YOUR FOOT HITS THE GROUND. GRAVITY IS WHAT COMPELSYOU TO PUT YOUR FOOT ON THE GROUND, AND IF YOU DIDN’T PUT THAT FOOT DOWN, YOU’DBE DOING A WHOLE LOT OF STUMBLING.19THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WALKING AND PUNCHING IS THAT BY EXTENDING YOUR FIST, YOUFOCUS MUCH OF THAT GRAVITATIONAL FORCE TOWARD THE TARGET. SO, THE NEXT STEP ISTO HARNESS THAT GRAVITATIONAL FORCE AND CHANNEL IT INTO YOUR PUNCHES. SEE FIGURE61.[../Images/92a.jpg]FIGURE 61: THE STRAIGHT LEAD AT IMPACT. I’VE MADE CONTACT WITH THE TARGET WHILESTILL IN THE AIR. THIS WAY, I REDIRECT GRAVITY’S DOWNWARD PULL INTO THE PUNCHAND NOT INTO THE GROUND. MY ARM IS BENT JUST ENOUGH TO ALLOW FOR 3–4 INCHES OFFOLLOW-THROUGH. THIS IS ALSO THE FIRST PART OF THE THREE-POINT LANDING.REDIRECTING DOWNWARD FORCEAS YOU MAY RECALL FROM HIGH SCHOOL PHYSICS, THE VELOCITY OF AN OBJECT HAS BOTHMAGNITUDE AND DIRECTION. IN PHYSICS, THESE TWO QUALITIES ARE REPRESENTED INDIAGRAMS BY ARROWS CALLED VECTORS. I DON’T WANT TO GO INTO TOO MUCH DETAILREGARDING VECTORS HERE, SO WE’LL JUST COVER THE BASICS. AS YOU ALREADY KNOW, ANOBJECT MAY TRAVEL ALONG A PATH COMPRISING MORE THAN ONE DIRECTION. IN THE CASEOF COMING DOWN FROM THE PUSH-OFF, WE WOULD BE TRAVELING BOTH TOWARD THE TARGETAND TOWARD THE GROUND. A SEPARATE VECTOR WOULD REPRESENT EACH DIRECTION. THE SUMOF TWO OR MORE VECTORS IS CALLED THEIR RESULTANT.THE DIAGRAM BELOW ILLUSTRATES HOW VECTORS REPRESENT THE DIRECTION OF APROJECTILE. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CURVE, THE PROJECTILE IS MOVING BOTH UPWARDAND HORIZONTALLY. THE DIAGONAL VECTOR IS THE RESULTANT. AT THE END OF THE CURVE,THE PROJECTILE IS MOVING BOTH DOWNWARD AND HORIZONTALLY. AGAIN, THE DIAGONALVECTOR IS THE RESULTANT. SEE FIGURE 62.[../Images/93a.jpg]FIGURE 62: PROJECTILE TRAJECTORY AND ITS CONSTITUENT VECTORS.TO DETERMINE THE RESULTANT OF TWO VECTORS THAT AREN’T ACTING IN THE SAME OROPPOSITE DIRECTION, WE USE THE PARALLELOGRAM RULE BY APPLYING THE GOOD OL’PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM EXPRESSED AS:[../Images/93b.jpg]TO USE A PARALLELOGRAM, WE TAKE THE SUM OF THE SQUARES OF THE VERTICAL ANDHORIZONTAL VECTORS. THEN WE TAKE THE SQUARE ROOT OF THIS SUM, WHICH TELLS USWHAT THE DIAGONAL VECTOR IS. FOR YOU GEOMETRY WHIZZES, YES, THAT’S THEHYPOTENUSE. SEE FIGURE 63.[../Images/93c.jpg]FIGURE 63: FINDING THE RESULTANT.ENOUGH MATH? DON’T WORRY. THERE WON’T BE A POP QUIZ. JUST KEEP THESE CONCEPTS INMIND, THOUGH, AS YOU TRY TO MASTER THE STRAIGHT LEAD. IN TERMS OF THROWING APUNCH, LET’S LOOK AT HOW VECTORS ARE INVOLVED. DURING THAT SECOND HALF OF THEPUSH-OFF, YOU ARE TRAVELING IN TWO DIRECTIONS—LINEARLY TOWARD THE TARGET ANDVERTICALLY DOWNWARD TOWARD THE EARTH. THE RESULTANT IS THE FORCE YOU BRINGTOWARD THE TARGET.THE CONCEPT OF VECTORS IS MORE EASILY UNDERSTOOD IN LESS ABSTRACT TERMS INDEMPSEY’S EXAMPLE OF A BOY SLEDDING DOWN A SLOPE. THE SLED IS ACTUALLY MOVING INTWO DIRECTIONS— DOWNWARD AS IT IS PULLED TO THE EARTH BY GRAVITY AND LINEARLY.THIS IS BECAUSE THE SLOPE IS AT AN ANGLE, DOWN A SLOPE. AT THE BOTTOM OF THEHILL, HOWEVER, ALL THAT DOWNWARD FORCE IS REDIRECTED LINEARLY, AND THE SLEDMOVES WITH INCREASED SPEED ON LEVEL GROUND.20THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE RELAY OUR BODY WEIGHT TO A TARGET WITH THESTRAIGHT PUNCH. AS WE RETURN TO THE GROUND AFTER PUSHING OFF, WE ARE ALSOSHOOTING OUT THE LEAD HAND. BECAUSE THE PUSH-OFF INVOLVES SOME UPWARD VERTICALMOTION, THE LANDING, IN TURN, INVOLVES SOME DOWNWARD VERTICAL MOTION DUE TOGRAVITY. THAT DOWNWARD FORCE OF OUR BODY WEIGHT BEING PULLED TO THE EARTH BYGRAVITY MUST BE TRANSFERRED TO THE TARGET BEFORE WE ACTUALLY TOUCH THE GROUND.BY DOING SO, WE ARE ABLE TO REDIRECT MORE OF THAT DOWNWARD FORCE AND USE IT TOOUR ADVANTAGE. SEE FIGURE 64.[../Images/94a.jpg]FIGURE 64: FOLLOW-THROUGH AND LANDING.S T E P S I X : C O N T A C T A N D R E T R A C T I N G T H E H A N DIN MANY MARTIAL ARTS, A PUNCH ENDS ONCE IT LANDS THE TARGET, BUT THIS IS NOT THECASE IN JEET KUNE DO, WHERE RETRACTION OF THE HAND IS EVERY BIT AS IMPORTANT ASLAUNCHING THE HAND FROM THE ON-GUARD STANCE. TO UNDERSTAND WHY, ONCE AGAIN,WE’LL TURN TO THE LAWS OF PHYSICS.MOMENTUM AND IMPULSERECALL NEWTON’S FIRST LAW OF INERTIA: AN OBJECT AT REST OR IN MOTION IN ASTRAIGHT LINE AT A CONSTANT SPEED WILL CONTINUE IN THAT STATE UNLESS ACTED UPONBY A FORCE. WE DEFINE MOMENTUM AS INERTIA IN MOTION—AN OBJECT TRAVELING IN ASTRAIGHT LINE AT A CONSTANT SPEED. THE EQUATION FOR MOMENTUM IS:MOMENTUM = MASS X VELOCITYALSO REMEMBER FROM THE STUDY OF VECTORS THAT WE DEFINE VELOCITY AS SPEED ANDDIRECTION. FROM THE EQUATION FOR MOMENTUM, WE KNOW THAT A SMALL OBJECT, SUCH ASA BULLET, CAN HAVE TREMENDOUS MOMENTUM BECAUSE WHEN FIRED FROM A GUN, IT TRAVELSAT AN INCREDIBLY HIGH SPEED. CONVERSELY, A LARGE OBJECT, SUCH AS A BOULDER, MAYHAVE NO MOMENTUM IF IT IS AT REST. ROLL THAT BOULDER DOWN A STEEP HILL, THOUGH,AND IT WILL HAVE QUITE A BIT OF MOMENTUM BECAUSE OF ITS VELOCITY ROLLING DOWNTHE HILL.NOW LET’S CONSIDER ANOTHER SCENARIO IN WHICH WE HAVE AN OBJECT WHOSE MASSREMAINS THE SAME BUT CHANGES IN VELOCITY. THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. WE HAVE AGOLF BALL AT REST. WHACK IT WITH A FIVE IRON, AND IT CHANGES ITS VELOCITY—ITSSPEED AND/OR DIRECTION CHANGES. OBVIOUSLY, THE OBJECT’S MOMENTUM HAS CHANGEDBECAUSE MOMENTUM IS A FUNCTION OF VELOCITY.BUT THERE’S SOMETHING ELSE WE MIGHT WANT TO MEASURE—THE TIME IT TAKES TO CAUSE ACHANGE IN MOMENTUM. AND WHAT CAUSES A CHANGE IN MOMENTUM? REMEMBER MOMENTUM IS ASTATE OF INERTIA, AND TO OVERCOME INERTIA, WE MUST APPLY FORCE. THE PRODUCT OFFORCE AND THE TIME DURING WHICH THAT FORCE IS APPLIED TO AN OBJECT IS CALLEDIMPULSE. MATHEMATICALLY, IT IS EXPRESSED AS:IMPULSE = FORCE X TIMESOMETHING TO CONSIDER WHEN DISCUSSING IMPULSE IS THAT THE SAME IMPULSE IS ALWAYSREQUIRED TO BRING AN OBJECT TO REST (DECREASE MOMENTUM). WHAT MAY VARY, THOUGH,ARE THE FORCE AND TIME. LET’S CONSIDER THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ROLLING WITH APUNCH AND RUNNING INTO ONE. WHEN WE ROLL WITH A PUNCH, WE INCREASE THE TIME OVERWHICH FORCE IS APPLIED, AND AS A RESULT, THE FORCE OR IMPACT IS DECREASED. IF WERUN INTO A PUNCH, THE TIME IT TAKES TO CHANGE THAT FIST’S MOMENTUM TO ZERO WITHOUR FACE IS GREATLY DECREASED. THEREFORE, FROM THE EQUATION, WE KNOW THE FORCEIS INCREASED. THAT’S WHY WE ROLL AWAY FROM PUNCHES INSTEAD OF RUNNING INTO THEM.LET’S TRY ANOTHER EXAMPLE. CONSIDER THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIGHT GLOVES ANDTRAINING GLOVES. WE ALL KNOW THAT WE’D RATHER FACE SOMEONE WEARING TRAININGGLOVES. WE FEEL LESS OF OUR OPPONENT’S PUNCHES. WHY? TRAINING GLOVES ARE MOREHEAVILY PADDED THAN FIGHT GLOVES. THE EXTRA PADDING EXTENDS THE LENGTH OF TIMEIT TAKES OUR FACE TO STOP A PUNCH. THAT FIST HAS TO WADE THROUGH ALL THATPADDING FIRST. MORE TIME MEANS LESS FORCE. IF WE’RE FACING FIGHT GLOVES, THOUGH,WE DON’T HAVE THAT EXTRA PROTECTION. A STIFFER GLOVE MEANS LESS IMPACT TIME. OURFACE BRINGS THAT FIST TO A HALT INSTANTLY. NOT PRETTY.SNAPPING AND JKDSO, WHAT DOES ALL OF THIS HAVE TO DO WITH THE FINAL STEP IN THROWING A STRAIGHTLEAD? RETRACTING THE HAND IS OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT GETS US BACK INTOPOSITION TO THROW THE NEXT PUNCH. BUT WHAT ISN’T COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD IS THAT HOWYOU RETRACT THAT HAND CAN GREATLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE DAMAGE YOU DO.FROM OUR DISCUSSION ABOUT IMPULSE, YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT THE FORCE OF YOUR FISTWILL BE MUCH GREATER WHEN THE TIME OF CONTACT WITH A TARGET IS VERY SHORT. THEMOMENTUM OF YOUR FIST IS DECREASED CONSIDERABLY WHEN YOU HIT, FOR EXAMPLE, AFOCUS MITT. AND THE LESS TIME YOUR FIST IS IN CONTACT WITH THAT FOCUS MITT, THEGREATER THE FORCE OF IMPACT. A SIMILAR EXAMPLE IS THAT OF CATCHING A BASEBALL.IF YOU MOVE YOUR HAND FORWARD TO MEET THE BALL, IT’S GOING TO HURT A LOT MORETHAN IF YOU MOVE YOUR HAND BACK AS YOUR GLOVE MAKES CONTACT WITH THE BALL. THEIMPULSE REQUIRED TO DECREASE THE BASEBALL’S MOMENTUM REMAINS THE SAME. BUTINCREASING THE TIME THE FORCE OF THE BALL IS APPLIED TO YOUR GLOVE DECREASES THEFORCE.NOW REMEMBER THAT SO FAR WE’VE DISCUSSED BRINGING OBJECTS IN MOTION TO REST BYDECREASING MOMENTUM. ALSO REMEMBER THAT VELOCITY IS DETERMINED BY BOTH SPEED ANDDIRECTION. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU ACTUALLY CHANGED DIRECTION OF YOUR FIST BYBOUNCING OFF THE FOCUS MITT AND RETRACTING THE HAND?BY CHANGING THE DIRECTION OF YOUR HAND, YOU ACTUALLY INCREASE THE IMPULSE,THEREBY INCREASING THE FORCE REQUIRED TO CHANGE DIRECTION. THINK ABOUT IT.STOPPING YOUR FIST REQUIRES A CERTAIN IMPULSE. CHANGING DIRECTION AFTER STOPPINGYOUR FIST ACTUALLY REQUIRES ADDITIONAL IMPULSE. AND IF THE TIME OF CONTACT, ORTIME DURING WHICH YOU APPLY FORCE, IS KEPT TO A MINIMUM, THE FORCE AT IMPACTWILL BE EVEN GREATER.THIS IS WHY BRUCE ALWAYS STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF “SNAPPINESS” TO PUNCHES ANDKICKS. IT’S NOT JUST THAT SNAPPING YOUR HAND BACK INTO THE STANCE PUTS YOU INTOBETTER POSITION TO GET THE NEXT SHOT OFF. IT DOES. BUT SNAPPING AT THE END OF APUNCH ALLOWS YOU TO RETRACT YOUR HAND MORE QUICKLY, ALLOWING YOU TO SNAP ORBOUNCE, AND BOUNCING OFF A TARGET, BECAUSE OF WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT IMPULSE, WILLGIVE MUCH MORE FORCE TO YOUR PUNCHES.THIS ISN’T TO SAY THAT YOU DON’T “GO THROUGH” THE TARGET AS DISCUSSED IN THEPREVIOUS SECTION ON MAKING CONTACT WITH THE TARGET. PENETRATING THE TARGET IS AVERY IMPORTANT PART OF DOING DAMAGE WITH THE STRAIGHT LEAD. AS BRUCE WROTE, “ALLPUNCHES SHOULD END WITH A SNAP SEVERAL INCHES BEHIND THE TARGET. THUS, YOU PUNCHTHROUGH THE OPPONENT YET END THE PUNCH WITH A SNAP.”21YOU MUST GO THROUGH THE TARGET. BUT OUR ARMS ARE ONLY SO LONG. AT SOME POINT,YOU WILL HAVE TO DECREASE YOUR MOMENTUM TO STOP YOUR HAND. THE FASTER YOUREVERSE DIRECTION AND BRING YOUR HAND BACK AFTER IT HAS STOPPED, THOUGH, THEMORE FORCEFUL THE IMPACT AS COMPARED TO THE IMPACT IF YOU’D JUST LET YOUR HANDDANGLE OUT THERE AND THEN SLOWLY RETRACTED IT. SNAPPING YOUR PUNCHES IS THEDIFFERENCE BETWEEN A DEVASTATING BLOW AND AN INNOCUOUS PUSH.THE MECHANICS OF RETRACTING THE HANDWE KNOW THAT MINIMIZING THE TIME OF CONTACT WITH A TARGET AND THEN RETRACTINGTHE HAND SWIFTLY GREATLY INCREASES FORCE. BUT HOW DO WE GO ABOUT DOING THAT?ONE OF THE MOST COMMON MISTAKES WHEN IT COMES TO RETRACTING IS DROPPING THE HANDONCE IT’S HIT THE TARGET. THE REASON WE DON’T WANT TO DO THIS IS SIMPLE. THESHORTEST DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO POINTS IS A STRAIGHT LINE. IN BOXING, EDWINHAISLET STRESSED, “THE ARM MUST TRAVEL A STRAIGHT LINE AND RETURN IN A STRAIGHTLINE.”22 IF WE DROP OUR HAND, WE ARE ACTUALLY MOVING IN A CIRCULAR MOTION, ANDTHIS SLOWS US DOWN. THE HAND WILL HAVE TO TRAVEL A FURTHER DISTANCE TO GET BACKINTO POSITION. NOT ONLY WILL YOU LOSE THE SNAP THAT COMES FROM SNAPPING YOURHAND BACK IN A STRAIGHT LINE, YOU WILL ALSO LOSE PRECIOUS TIME. YOU WILL NEVERBE ABLE TO FIRE EFFECTIVE DOUBLE AND TRIPLE JABS THIS WAY. NOR WILL YOU BE READYTO GET ANY SHOT OFF IF YOU ARE STILL OUT OF POSITION BECAUSE OF A SLOWRETRACTION.REMEMBER, EVERYTHING BEGINS AND ENDS WITH THE STANCE. YOU WANT TO GET BACK ASSOON AS POSSIBLE TO ON-GUARD. IF ANYTHING, YOUR RIGHT HAND SHOULD RETRACT FASTERTHAN IT SHOOTS OUT.DROPPING THE HAND ON ITS WAY BACK TO THE ON-GUARD POSITION ALSO SIGNIFICANTLYREDUCES YOUR PUNCH’S EFFICACY AT IMPACT. INSTEAD OF DIRECTING ALL YOUR FORCE ATAND THROUGH THE TARGET, YOU WILL SKID OFF THE FOCUS MITT. HENCE, THE NAME FOCUSMITT. YOU WANT TO FOCUS ALL OF YOUR PUNCH TOWARD THE TARGET. YOU DISSIPATE SOMEOF THAT FORCE WHEN YOU DROP YOUR HAND. SKIDDING OFF THE MITT SPLINTERS THATFORCE AND INCREASES THE TIME OF CONTACT WITH THE TARGET, WHICH AS YOU’LL RECALLFROM THE DISCUSSION OF IMPULSE, DECREASES THE DAMAGE YOUR PUNCH WILL CAUSE.THE SECOND MOST COMMON MISTAKE MADE WHEN GETTING BACK INTO POSITION IS ANALOGOUSTO THE PITFALLS OF ARM PUNCHING. REMEMBER THE KINETIC CHAIN. YOU WILL BE MUCHFASTER AND LESS FATIGUED IF YOU AVOID OVERTAXING ANY SINGLE BODY PART. A VERYCOMMON PROBLEM IS FAILURE TO ROTATE THE HIPS WHEN RETRACTING THE HAND. IF YOURARM COVERS ONLY HALF THE DISTANCE AND YOUR ROTATING HIPS COVER THE OTHER HALF,YOU WILL BE TWICE AS FAST THAN IF YOU WERE TO MOVE ONLY YOUR ARM.THE THREE -POINT LANDINGTHE FINAL STEP IN EXECUTING THE STRAIGHT LEAD IS WHAT TED WONG REFERS TO AS THETHREE-POINT LANDING. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, IF THERE IS A SEGMENT OF THE STRAIGHTLEAD THAT MIGHT BE CALLED “EASY,” THIS IS IT, FOR IF YOU HAVE PERFORMED ALL THEOTHER STEPS PERFECTLY AND IN THEIR CORRECT SEQUENCE, THIS FINAL STEP LITERALLYSHOULD FALL INTO PLACE.THE FIRST POINT OF THE THREE-POINT LANDING SHOULD BE YOUR FIST ON THE TARGET.YOU NEVER WANT EITHER THE LEAD OR REAR FOOT TO HIT THE GROUND BEFORE YOUR HANDLANDS THE TARGET. WHY? REMEMBER FROM THE DISCUSSION OF VECTORS AND PROJECTILEMOTION THAT YOU WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE DOWNWARD GRAVITATIONAL FORCEACTING ON YOUR BODY MASS. ALSO RECALL DEMPSEY’S EXPLANATION OF REDIRECTING THESLED HORIZONTALLY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SLOPE.WHAT YOU’RE DOING BY HITTING THE TARGET BEFORE YOUR FRONT FOOT HITS THE GROUNDIS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE SECOND, DOWNWARD HALF OF PROJECTILE MOTION ANDREDIRECTING THE FORCE OF YOUR BODY WEIGHT TOWARD THE TARGET. IF YOUR FOOT LANDSBEFORE YOU HIT THE TARGET, ALL THAT FORCE GOES INTO THE GROUND AND IS WASTED.REGARDING THE MECHANICS OF THE FRONT FOOT LANDING, YOU’LL WANT TO LAND ON THEHEEL FIRST AND THEN LET THE REST OF THE FOOT TOUCH THE FLOOR. THIS IS TO ENSUREA STABLE LANDING. LANDING ON YOUR TOES, FOR INSTANCE, WILL RESULT IN A LOSS OFBALANCE. AGAIN, WE WANT TO MAINTAIN THAT POTENTIAL ENERGY ON THE INSIDE PORTIONOF BOTH LEGS WHICH ENABLES QUICKER, MORE EXPLOSIVE MOVEMENT. SEE FIGURE 65.[../Images/98a.jpg]FIGURE 65: FOR MAXIMUM STABILITY AND CONTROL, THE LANDING STARTS WITH THETOUCHING DOWN OF THE FRONT HEEL. THIS IS PART TWO OF THE THREE-POINT LANDING.LANDING OF THE REAR FOOT IS THE LAST OF THE THREE POINTS. AFTER INITIATING THEPUSH-OFF, THE LEFT LEG GETS A WELL-DESERVED REST AND MERELY GOES ALONG FOR THERIDE. THE HAND HITS THE TARGET, THE LEAD FOOT RESTS HEEL FIRST ON THE GROUND,AND THE REAR FOOT FOLLOWS. AS YOUR HAND RETRACTS AND YOUR FRONT FOOT LANDS, THEREAR FOOT COMPLETES THE RETURN TO THE ON-GUARD POSITION. AT THE END OF THEPUNCH, YOU SHOULD BE RIGHT BACK IN THE STANCE, FEET SLIGHTLY WIDER THANSHOULDERS’ WIDTH APART, WITH NO ADJUSTMENTS, NO MATTER HOW SMALL, REQUIRED TOFIRE OFF ANOTHER PERFECT STRAIGHT. SEE FIGURE 66.[../Images/99a.jpg]FIGURE 66: PART THREE OF THE THREE-POINT LANDING: TOUCHING DOWN WITH THE BACKFOOT.DRAWING INIF YOU’VE SPENT ANY TIME IN A GYM LATELY, YOU’LL KNOW THAT THERE’S A LOT OF TALKTHESE DAYS ABOUT SOMETHING CALLED “CORE TRAINING.” THE CORE REFERS TO THAT PARTOF THE BODY THAT INCLUDES EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE ARMS AND LEGS. IN ANATOMICALTERMS, WE CALL THIS THE LUMBO-PELVIC-HIP COMPLEX.THE CORE COMPRISES TWO MUSCLE SETS. THE FIRST GROUP MAKES UP THE MOVEMENT SYSTEMAND INCLUDES SUPERFICIAL MUSCLES THAT HELP MOVE THE RIBS, ARMS, AND LEGS. THESEMUSCLES INCLUDE THE LATISSIMUS DORSI, ERECTOR SPINAE, ILIOPSOAS, HAMSTRINGS,ADDUCTORS, RECTUS ABDOMINUS, AND EXTERNAL OBLIQUES.THE SECOND GROUP CONSISTS OF STABILIZERS. THESE ARE DEEP MUSCLES THAT CONNECTTHE VERTE-BRAE OF THE LUMBAR SPINE, PELVIS, AND SACRUM AND INCLUDE THETRANSVERSE ABDOMINUS, INTERNAL OBLIQUE, LUMBAR MULTIFIDUS, PELVIC FLOOR MUSCLES,AND DIAPHRAGM. THESE MUSCLES DO NOT ACTUALLY PRODUCE MOVEMENT, BUT ALL MOVEMENTREQUIRES THEIR RECRUITMENT.23AND THIS GOES BACK TO THE EARLIER DISCUSSION OF BODY FEEL. YOU CANNOT ACTUALLYSEE THE ACTIVATION OF THE DEEP MUSCULATURE OF THE CORE. YOU HAVE TO FEEL IT.TRAINERS REFER TO THIS AS THE “DRAWING-IN” MANEUVER. YOU WILL FIND REFERENCES TOIT IN MANY INSTRUCTIONAL SPORTS BOOKS. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT IN HEALTHYPEOPLE, ACTIVATION OF CORE MUSCULATURE OCCURS BETWEEN 30 AND 110 MILLISECONDSBEFORE OUTER MUSCLE ACTIVITY. FROM GOLF SWINGS AND TENNIS SERVES TO CHESTPRESSES AND LAT PULL-DOWNS, ACTIVATION OF THE CORE MUSCLES IS NECESSARY FOREFFICIENT FORCE PRODUCTION. THE STRAIGHT LEAD IS NO EXCEPTION.AGAIN, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CANNOT SEE. IN THE SIMPLEST TERMS, YOU MIGHTDESCRIBE “DRAWING IN” AS A SLIGHT TENSING OF THE MUSCLES IN THE ABDOMINAL AREAJUST PRIOR TO MAKING A MOVE.TO PRACTICE IT, TAKE A DEEP BREATH. THIS ACTIVATES THE DIAPHRAGM, WHICH WORKSSYNERGISTICALLY WITH THE TRANSVERSE ABDOMINUS. YOUR RIB CAGE SHOULD NOT BEELEVATED. EXHALE. NOW DRAW IN YOUR NAVEL, BUT DO NOT “SUCK IN” YOUR BELLY.DRAWING IN IS A MUCH SUBTLER MUSCLE ACTIVATION THAN SUCKING IN YOUR GUT, AND ITSHOULDN’T APPEAR AS IF YOU’RE SUCKING IT IN. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THISWITHOUT MOVEMENT OF THE TRUNK, SHOULDERS, HEAD, OR SPINE. REMEMBER YOU AREPREPARING YOUR BODY FOR MOVEMENT BY STABILIZING YOUR CORE. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHEDBY DRAWING IN, WHICH ACTIVATES THE RECTUS ABDOMINUS AND EXTERNAL OBLIQUES.24ACTIVATION OF THE CORE IS IMPERATIVE, FOR IT IS THE FOUNDATION OF ALL MOVEMENT.EVEN IF THE MOVEMENT SYSTEM—ARMS AND LEGS—IS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING FORCE INISOLATION, OVERALL FORCE PRODUCTION WILL BE GREATLY DIMINISHED WITHOUT A STRONGCORE FOUNDATION, FOR IT IS THE CORE THAT PROVIDES INTERNAL STABILITY. IT IS THESTABLE FOUNDATION ON WHICH THE MOVEMENT SYSTEM IS BUILT.ON A MORE IMPORTANT NOTE, A STRONG CORE LEADS TO FEWER INJURIES. IF THE CORE ISNOT ADEQUATELY ACTIVATED BEFORE THE MOVEMENT SYSTEM, THE SPINE IS NOTSTABILIZED, LEAVING IT VULNERABLE TO FORCES ACTING ON THE INTERVERTEBRAL DISCSAND JOINTS. A WEAK CORE AND/OR FAILURE TO ACTIVATE CORE MUSCLES ARE LEADINGCAUSES OF BACK INJURIES.AGAIN, YOU NEED TO FEEL THE DRAWING-IN MANEUVER. DRAWING IN, BY THE WAY, IS VERYCLOSELY RELATED TO YOUR MENTAL STATE. THAT PREPARATION OF YOUR BODY JUST PRIORTO SHOOTING STRAIGHT SHOULD BE IN SYNC WITH YOUR MENTAL PREPARATION. EVERY TIMEYOU THROW A PUNCH, YOU SHOULD FEEL THAT TENSION IN YOUR ABDOMINAL AREA JUSTBEFORE DOING SO. TO THROW A HARD AND FAST STRAIGHT RIGHT, YOU MUST FIRSTSTABILIZE THE CORE.“THE LAST MOMENT OF ACCELERATION ”IN DISCUSSING THE SEQUENCE OF STRAIGHT LEAD MECHANICS, I’VE DIGRESSED TO EXPLAINTHE UNDERLYING PHYSICS AND BIOMECHANICS OF EACH STEP AND WHY THEY’VE BEEN PLACEDIN THIS PARTICULAR ORDER. SO, LET’S REVIEW THE SEQUENCE ONE MORE TIME.THE MECHANICAL STEPS OF THE STRAIGHT LEAD OCCUR IN THIS PARTICULAR ORDER WITHTHE AIM OF CULMINATING IN THE GREATEST POSSIBLE HAND ACCELERATION AT THE POINTOF IMPACT.25 SEE FIGURES 67 THROUGH 72.[../Images/101a.jpg]FIGURE 67: STARTING POSITION FROM THE STANCE.

IT WAS JOE MONTANA’S FOOTWORK THAT CAUGHT THE EYE OF BILLWALSH FOR THE 1979 NFL DRAFT. LISTEN TO JOHN MCENROE’S COMMENTARY. WHEN HE COMESACROSS A PLAYER HE LIKES, THE FIRST THINGS HE RAVES ABOUT ARE “BIG, STRONG LEGS”AND “GREAT FOOTWORK.” ANDRE AGASSI TOLD CHARLIE ROSE THAT INCREASED FOOTWORKPRECISION HAS BEEN KEY TO HIS TENNIS LONGEVITY. MANY BELIEVE NADI’S GREATESTSTRENGTH WAS HIS FOOTWORK, AND SUGAR RAY LEONARD3 SAID THAT HE LEARNED MUCH OFHIS FOOTWORK BY STUDYING BRUCE LEE’S FILMS.BRUCE HIMSELF SAID, “FOOTWORK CAN BEAT ANY ATTACK, AND A PROPERLY MAINTAINEDDISTANCE WILL BAFFLE ANY SKILLED OPPONENT.”4 IF IT MEANS BEATING ANY ATTACK,ISN’T IT WORTH DEVELOPING?WITH SO MANY ELITE ATHLETES ARGUING THE IMPORTANCE OF FOOTWORK, IT AMAZES METHAT IT IS SO UNDERSTUDIED, OVERLOOKED, AND OUTRIGHT NEGLECTED. MARTIAL ARTISTSMAY BE THE WORST PERPETRATORS. I’VE ACTUALLY HEARD INSTRUCTORS TELL THEIRSTUDENTS TO JUST APE THE INSTRUCTOR’S UPPER BODY MOVEMENTS AND THE FEET “WILLJUST FOLLOW.” WRONG. TO THROW AN EDUCATED PUNCH, YOU NEED TO HAVE EDUCATED FEET.TRUE, SOME BOXERS HAVE A NATURAL APTITUDE FOR FOOTWORK, BUT YOU CAN TRAIN TODEVELOP AND IMPROVE IT. THAT MANY DO NOT IS INSANITY.THIS IS ONE SUBJECT THAT MADE ALL THREE OF OUR ANGRY YOUNG MEN—DEMPSEY,DRISCOLL, AND NADI—WELL, SO ANGRY. THEY ALL EXPRESSED DISSATISFACTION WITH THELACK OF HIGH-QUALITY INSTRUCTION REGARDING FOOTWORK. “[ALL THE REAL CHAMPIONS],”DRISCOLL OBSERVED, “ARE MEN WHO HIT STRAIGHT, USE THE LEFT HAND AS IT SHOULD BEUSED, ARE FULLY AWARE OF THE FACT THE FEET ARE AS IMPORTANT AS THE HANDS IN THEBOXING GAME.”5OF FOOTWORK, NADI COMPLAINED, “OF ALL THE TEACHERS I HAVE SEEN AT WORK I HAVEYET TO SEE ONE TRAIN HIS PUPILS IN THIS ESSENTIAL WORK. THEY SIMPLY LET THEMFIND OUT FOR THEMSELVES. IN THE BEST CASES THIS MEANS A TREMENDOUS LOSS OF TIMEBEFORE THE PUPIL FAMILIARIZES HIMSELF WITH COMBAT TACTICS.”6RECALL THE WAYS IN WHICH DEMPSEY DECLARED BOXING WAS “BEING TAUGHT WRONG NEARLYEVERYWHERE.” FOUR OF THOSE REASONS INVOLVE FOOTWORK:[../Images/a.jpg] BEGINNERS ARE NOT GROUNDED IN THE FOUR PRINCIPAL METHODS OFPUTTING BODY WEIGHT IN FAST MOTION: (A) FALLING STEP, (B) LEG SPRING, (C)SHOULDER WHIRL, (D) UPWARD SURGE.[../Images/a.jpg] XPLOSIVE STRAIGHT PUNCHING HAS BECOME ALMOST A LOST ARTBECAUSE INSTRUCTORS PLACE SO MUCH EMPHASIS ON SHOULDER WHIRL, THAT BEGINNERS ARETAUGHT WRONGFULLY TO PUNCH STRAIGHT WITHOUT STEPPING WHENEVER POSSIBLE.[../Images/a.jpg] FAILURE TO TEACH THE FALLING STEP (“TRIGGER STEP”) FORSTRAIGHT PUNCHING HAS RESULTED IN THE LEFT JAB BEING USED GENERALLY AS A LIGHT,AUXILIARY WEAPON FOR MAKING OPENINGS AND “SETTING UP,” INSTEAD OF AS A STUNNINGBLOW.[../Images/a.jpg] BEGINNERS ARE NOT WARNED THAT TAKING LONG STEPS WITH HOOKS MAYOPEN UP THOSE HOOKS INTO SWINGS.7[../Images/2.jpg]N O T J U S T C O V E R I N G D I S T A N C EA COMMON MISCONCEPTION IS THAT FOOTWORK IS ONLY ABOUT GETTING FROM POINT A TOPOINT B. MANY INSTRUCTORS GLOSS OVER FOOTWORK, THINKING IT BENEATH THEM TOMASTER THE FUNDAMENTALS. THEY FIGURE ALL THE ACTION TAKES PLACE FROM THE TORSOUP. SO, THEY GALLOP INTO BATTLE AND THEN WONDER WHY THEIR PUNCHES ARE SOPOWDERPUFF.DEMPSEY KNEW FOOTWORK WAS THE ANSWER. THE FALLING STEP, LEG SPRING, SHOULDERWHIRL—YES, EVEN SHOULDER WHIRL—AND UPWARD SURGE TO WHICH HE REFERRED ARE ALLASPECTS OF FOOTWORK. WHAT PEOPLE OFTEN DO NOT REALIZE IS THAT FOOTWORK IS SOMUCH MORE THAN JUST COVERING DISTANCE. PUNCH MECHANICS ARE DETERMINED BYALIGNMENT, AND ALIGNMENT STARTS FROM THE GROUND. HOW YOU POSITION YOUR FEETDETERMINES THE ALIGNMENT OF YOUR LEGS. YOUR LEGS ARE ATTACHED TO AND DETERMINETHE POSITION OF YOUR TRUNK. AND YOUR ARMS ARE ATTACHED TO YOUR TRUNK. FOR SOMEPUNCHES, LIKE THE HOOK AND THE UPPERCUT, THE ARM IS REALLY JUST ALONG FOR THERIDE. IT’S THE BODY THAT DOES ALL THE WORK, BECAUSE THAT’S WHERE ALL YOUR WEIGHTIS. IF YOU WANT TO AVOID BEING AN ARM PUNCHER, YOU NEED TO THROW YOUR WEIGHTINTO YOUR PUNCHES. AND TO DO THAT, YOU NEED FOOTWORK.THE SAME IS TRUE OF DEFENSIVE MOVES. TO REMAIN IN BALANCE FOR STABILITY ANDMOBILITY, YOU CANNOT RELY ON MOVING ONLY FROM THE WAIST UP. YOU MUST CORRECTLYPOSITION YOUR CENTER OF GRAVITY, AND TO DO THAT WHILE IN MOTION, YOU NEEDFOOTWORK.A LOT OF ESSENTIAL FOOTWORK IS ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE TO THE UNTRAINED EYE. WHENYOU SHIFT YOUR WEIGHT FROM ONE LEG TO ANOTHER—AS IN A HOOK PUNCH OR BOBBING ANDWEAVING—THAT’S FOOTWORK. KEEPING YOUR LEFT HEEL OFF THE GROUND, NOT TOO HIGH ANDNOT TOO LOW, THAT’S PRECISE FOOTWORK. WHEN MAKING TINY ADJUSTMENTS—A MATTER OFINCHES—WHILE MAINTAINING THE FIGHTING MEASURE, THAT’S FOOTWORK. IF YOU WATCH THEFOOTAGE OF BRUCE DEMONSTRATING THE STRAIGHT LEAD AT THE INTERNATIONAL KARATETOURNAMENT IN 1967,8 YOU’LL SEE HIM THROWING THAT PUNCH FROM A SEEMINGLYSTATIONARY POSITION. TRUE, HE MAY NOT BE COVERING ANY DISTANCE, BUT THERE’S ALOT OF FOOTWORK GOING ON THERE. THERE’S THE PUSH-OFF AND A TREMENDOUS TRANSFEROF WEIGHT FROM THE LEFT LEG TO THE LEAD RIGHT LEG.PEOPLE HAVE BEEN BAFFLED BY BRUCE’S LEGENDARY 1-INCH PUNCH AND WHAT HAYWARDNISHIOKA REFERRED TO AS A PUZZLING “TWITCH” OF THE HIPS. WHAT THEY MAY NOTREALIZE IS THAT THERE’S A HECK OF A LOT OF PUSH-OFF COMING FROM THE REAR LEG ANDA TRANSFER IN ENERGY TO THE LEAD LEG THAT MAKES THAT HIP TWITCH POSSIBLE. YOUMAY HAVE TO LOOK CAREFULLY TO EVEN NOTICE THAT HE IS COMING OFF THE GROUND ATALL, BUT IT’S THERE. THAT’S THE PUSH-OFF IN PLACE, AND IT MAKES ALL THEDIFFERENCE. AS YOU’LL FIND IN HIS NOTES, BRUCE DID NOT DESCRIBE FOOTWORK ONLY INTERMS OF COVERING DISTANCE. “FOOT WORK CAN ADD WEIGHT AND POWER TO A PUNCH OR AKICK,” HE WROTE.9 THIS IS BECAUSE FOOTWORK CONTRIBUTES TO FORCE PRODUCTION BYDETERMINING YOUR WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION. FOOTWORK IN JKD SERVES AS MUCH MORE THAN AMERE TRANSPORT SYSTEM. IT’S THE KEY TO ALIGNMENT AND LEVERAGE.SPEAKING OF HIPS, WE TALK A LOT ABOUT USING THE HIP AS A GUIDE TO OUR MECHANICS.WE ALWAYS WANT TO MOVE IN A WAY SO THAT THE HIP WILL BE POINTING TOWARD THETARGET, WHETHER THAT BE PUNCHING OR KICKING MECHANICS. ALWAYS REMEMBER, THOUGH,YOU CANNOT GET YOUR HIPS IN THE PROPER POSITION WITHOUT FIRST MOVING YOUR FEET.THIS IS WHAT DEMPSEY WAS GETTING AT. THE FALLING STEP, LEG SPRING, AND UPWARDSURGE MAY NOT INVOLVE COVERING ANY DISTANCE, BUT THEY ARE ALL IMPORTANT ELEMENTSOF FOOTWORK. AND THE SHOULDER WHIRL TO WHICH HE REFERS IS IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUTFOOTWORK. TO MOVE YOUR SHOULDERS, YOU MUST MOVE YOUR TRUNK. TO MOVE YOUR TRUNK,YOU NEED TO MOVE YOUR LEGS. AND TO MOVE YOUR LEGS, YOU NEED TO MOVE YOUR FEET.ALL PUNCHES REALLY DO START FROM THE GROUND UP.[../Images/2.jpg]T H E F I G H T I N G M E A S U R EIT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT IN ORDER TO SUCCESSFULLY LAND A BLOW, YOU MUST FIRSTMOVE TOWARD YOUR OPPONENT. A FORCEFUL PUNCH MEANS LITTLE IF YOU ARE NOT INPOSITION TO THROW IT. OF COURSE, IF YOU’RE CLOSE ENOUGH TO LAND A BLOW, THENYOU’RE ALSO CLOSE ENOUGH TO GET TAGGED YOURSELF. THIS IS WHY MAINTENANCE OF THEFIGHTING MEASURE IS SO IMPORTANT. ACCORDING TO CROSNIER, THE FIGHTING MEASURE ISTHE DISTANCE AT WHICH A FENCER CANNOT HIT OR BE HIT WITHOUT A FULL LUNGE. ONE OFTHE MAIN PURPOSES OF PLAYING WITH DISTANCE IS TO MAKE YOUR OPPONENT MISJUDGETHAT FIGHTING MEASURE BY LURING OR TRICKING HIM INTO YOUR STRIKING DISTANCE.10THE FIGHTING MEASURE—OR JUDGMENT OF DISTANCE—IS CRUCIAL. WITHOUT IT, YOU WON’TBE ABLE TO REACH YOUR TARGET. EVEN WORSE, YOU CAN EXPECT TO TAKE A LOT OF SHOTS.AND HOW DO YOU MAINTAIN THE FIGHTING MEASURE? FOOTWORK. SEE FIGURE 73.[../Images/111a.jpg]FIGURE 73: FOOTWORK MAKES MAINTAINING THE FIGHTING MEASURE POSSIBLE.IT’S WORTH NOTING HERE THAT CROSNIER WAS A STICKLER FOR GOOD FORM AND THEFUNDAMENTALS OF THE ON-GUARD POSITION. WITHOUT GOOD FORM, GOOD FOOTWORK ISIMPOSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE. THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE WAS UNDERLINED IN BRUCE LEE’S COPYOF CROSNIER’S FENCING WITH THE FOIL:> THE FENCER PRACTICING HIS FOOTWORK WILL FIND THAT HIS MOBILITY WILL BE GREATLY> HANDICAPPED IF HIS ON-GUARD POSITION IS NOT PERFECT. AN INCORRECT DISTRIBUTION> OF WEIGHT WILL MEAN THAT HE WILL HAVE TO SHIFT HIS BODY FORWARD, OR BACKWARD,> IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO FREE THE LEG THAT IS CARRYING THE EXTRA BURDEN WHEN HE> WISHES TO MOVE IT. HE WILL READILY APPRECIATE, THEN, THE NECESSITY OF PAYING> ATTENTION TO HIS BASIC STANCE AND POSITION ON GUARD.11WE’LL COME BACK TO THE FIGHTING MEASURE WHEN WE DISCUSS HOW TO APPLY THESTRAIGHT LEAD. FOR NOW, THOUGH, KNOW THAT MAINTENANCE OF THE FIGHTING MEASURE ISWHERE YOU ARE SAFE AND THAT IT IS ACHIEVED THROUGH FOOTWORK, FOOTWORK, FOOTWORK.[../Images/2.jpg]T H E L E F T F O O T D I C T A T E S D I S T A N C EBEFORE WE GET INTO THE MECHANICS OF FOOTWORK AS IT RELATES TO THE STRAIGHT LEAD,REALIZE THAT IT IS THE LEFT FOOT THAT IS YOUR DISTANCE REGULATOR. THE PUSH-OFFFROM YOUR LEFT FOOT IS WHAT ENABLES YOU TO REACH AN OPPONENT—NOT YOUR UPPER BODYOR ARM REACH. A COMMON MISTAKE IS OVERREACHING WITH THE RIGHT HAND AND UPPERBODY. IN THIS CASE, YOUR CENTER OF GRAVITY—AS DISCUSSED EARLIER—WILL OVERTAKEYOUR FRONT LEG, TAKING YOU OUT OF YOUR BASE OF SUPPORT AND THEREBY UNBALANCINGYOU. THIS WILL PUT YOU IN A PRECARIOUS POSITION TO WARD OFF COUNTERATTACKS, WILLHAMPER YOUR RECOVERY TO THE STANCE, AND COMPROMISE YOUR PUNCHING FORCE.12TO REACH YOUR TARGET, THEN, YOU MUST USE YOUR FEET. THE MOVEMENT FROM YOUR UPPERBODY SHOULD BE CONSISTENT. YOU WILL ROTATE AT THE HIPS, SLIGHTLY LEAN FORWARD,AND EXTEND YOUR RIGHT ARM TO THE SAME DEGREE EVERY TIME YOU THROW THAT STRAIGHTLEAD. WHAT CHANGES THEN? THE DISTANCE YOU COVER WITH YOUR FEET—MORESPECIFICALLY, THE DISTANCE YOU COVER WITH THE PUSH-OFF.YOU CAN PRACTICE THIS BY VARYING THE DISTANCE YOU COVER WITH THE PUSH-OFF.SOMETIMES AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE FOOTAGE OF BRUCE’S 1-INCH PUNCH, YOU WILL PUSHOFF IN PLACE AND NOT COVER ANY DISTANCE. OTHER TIMES, YOU WILL NEED TO PUSH OFFFROM LONG RANGE TO REACH YOUR TARGET. BE CAREFUL, THOUGH. DO NOT INCREASE THEDISTANCE YOU COVER WITH THE PUSH-OFF UNTIL YOU HAVE ACHIEVED SUFFICIENT CONTROLAT A SHORTER DISTANCE. PRECISION AND CONTROL SHOULD BE YOUR CHIEF OBJECTIVES.I’LL TALK ABOUT HOW TO ACHIEVE THIS SHORTLY.T Y P E S O F F O O T W O R KAT ITS MOST BASIC LEVEL, FOOTWORK INVOLVES MOVING IN ONLY FOURDIRECTIONS—FORWARD, BACKWARD, LEFT, AND RIGHT. MAYBE THAT DOESN’T SOUND TOOEXCITING, BUT THE VARIATIONS OF HOW YOU MOVE IN THOSE FOUR DIRECTIONS, THEPHYSICS AND PRECISION INVOLVED, MAKE THOSE FOUR DIRECTIONS INFINITELY COMPLEX.THERE’S SIDESTEPPING LEFT AND RIGHT. THERE’S ALSO PIVOTING LEFT AND RIGHT.THERE’S PIVOTING ON THE BOUNCE, THE HALF-BEAT, OR WITH A BOB AND WEAVE. YOU CANSTEP AND SLIDE BACKWARD, PUSH STEP BACKWARD, OR PENDULUM STEP BACKWARD. YOU CANPENDULUM STEP WHILE COMING OUT OF A PIVOTING BOUNCE! THE COMBINATIONS AREENDLESS.AND THEN THERE’S THE STEP THAT SEEMS TO GIVE GUYS FITS IN TED WONG’SSEMINARS—THE “FANCY STEP,” AS HE CALLS IT, WHICH IS SOMETHING OF A CROSS BETWEENA SIDEWAYS JUMPING JACK AND A SIDESTEP. YOU’LL SEE OSCAR DE LA HOYA AND A NUMBEROF OTHER BOXERS USE THIS ONE WHENEVER THEY NEED TO CHANGE DIRECTIONS QUICKLY.NOW IMAGINE BEING ABLE TO FIRE OFF A STRAIGHT LEAD—OR A VARIATION OF ASTRAIGHT—OFF OF ANY OF THESE STEPS NO MATTER WHERE YOUR WEIGHT IS DISTRIBUTED.MOST ARTS REQUIRE YOU TO “COMPLETE” A STEP BEFORE YOU ARE IN POSITION TO FIRE ASHOT. YOU STEP WITH ONE FOOT AND THEN MUST LAND WITH THE OTHER. AND THEN YOU CANTHROW A PUNCH. IF YOU’VE STUDIED MUSIC OR DANCE AT ALL, YOU CAN THINK OF THIS ASONE WHOLE BEAT. THE STEP WITH THE FRONT FOOT IS THE FIRST BEAT. LANDING OF THEBACK FOOT IS THE “AND” OF THAT BEAT. THEN YOU’RE READY TO STEP AGAIN. THAT’S THESECOND BEAT. LANDING WITH THE REAR FOOT IS THE “AND” OF THE SECOND BEAT.MOST ARTS ONLY ALLOW FOR PUNCHING “ON THE BEAT.” WITH GOOD FOOTWORK, THOUGH, YOUCAN PUNCH ON THE “AND”—OR THE HALF-BEAT.13 THIS IS WHAT MAKES FOR EDUCATED FEET.SINCE MOST ARTS DON’T TRAIN TO INCORPORATE THE HALF-BEAT, THIS GIVES YOU ADEFINITE TACTICAL ADVANTAGE. WHILE YOUR OPPONENT’S STILL SETTLING INTO POSITION,SETTING UP FOR THE NEXT BEAT, YOU’VE ALREADY POPPED HIM ON THE HALF-BEAT.WORKING WITH HALF-BEATS EXPONENTIALLY EXPANDS YOUR OPTIONS. PLAYING WITHDISTANCE AND TIME MAKES YOU UNPREDICTABLE, KEEPS YOUR OPPONENT GUESSING. YOU CANSET HIM UP BY CREATING PATTERNS AND THEN BREAKING THEM—TRICK HIM INTO COMINGWITHIN YOUR STRIKING DISTANCE. ALL OF THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH FOOTWORK.AND IN JKD, YOUR STRAIGHT IS THE MAIN WEAPON WITH WHICH YOU’LL BE SETTING UPYOUR ATTACKS. TO BE ABLE TO USE THOSE HALF-BEATS, THEN, YOU’LL NEED TO BE ABLETO THROW THAT LEAD PUNCH FROM ANYWHERE. THE WINDOW OF STRIKING OPPORTUNITYCLOSES IN A MATTER OF MILLISECONDS. GOOD FOOTWORK ALLOWS YOU TO TAKE ADVANTAGEOF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. YOU CAN THROW A LEAD FROM THE ON-GUARD POSITION, WHILEYOUR FRONT FOOT IS STILL IN THE AIR, WITH YOUR WEIGHT DISTRIBUTED MOSTLY IN YOURFRONT FOOT, OR BEFORE YOUR REAR FOOT HAS LANDED. WITHOUT FOOTWORK, NONE OF THISIS POSSIBLE.TO INCLUDE A COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE TO FOOTWORK IS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THIS BOOK.WHAT I’LL COVER HERE WILL ONLY ILLUSTRATE THE WAYS OF ADVANCING FORWARD WITH THESTRAIGHT LEAD. BUT KEEP IN MIND THIS IS ONLY A TINY GLIMPSE OF WHAT EDUCATEDFOOTWORK IS ALL ABOUT.T H E S T E P A N D S L I D ETHE STEP AND SLIDE IS THE MOST BASIC AND MOST FREQUENTLY USED FOOTWORK STEP.IT’S NOT USED TO LAUNCH AN OFFENSIVE, BUT IT’S CRUCIAL AS A DISTANCEREGULATOR.14, 15, 16 THE STEP AND SLIDE IS HOW WE MAINTAIN THE FIGHTING MEASUREAND PLAY WITH IT IN ORDER TO CREATE SETUPS. I CALL IT “STALKING FOOTWORK.”TO EXECUTE THE STEP AND SLIDE, AS ALWAYS, YOU’LL START FROM THE ON-GUARDPOSITION. YOUR WEIGHT SHOULD BE DISTRIBUTED EVENLY BETWEEN BOTH FEET. LIFT YOURRIGHT FOOT AND STEP NO MORE THAN 6 INCHES FORWARD. YOUR WEIGHT SHOULD STILL BEABOUT 50-50, EVEN AS YOUR RIGHT FOOT IS ABOVE THE GROUND. JUST LET GRAVITY DOITS THING AND GENTLY LAND HEEL FIRST. AS YOUR RIGHT HEEL IS LANDING YOUR LEFTLEG SHOULD BE SLIDING FORWARD THE SAME DISTANCE THAT YOUR RIGHT FOOT ADVANCED.IT SHOULD LAND JUST AFTER THE FRONT FOOT DOES. YOU CAN SPOT EXAMPLES OF BRUCELEE’S STEP AND SLIDE IN RETURN OF THE DRAGON SCENES WITH CHUCK NORRIS. YOU’LLSEE HIM USING IT AS A DISTANCE REGULATOR AS HE’S JUDGING WHEN TO INTERCEPTCHUCK’S ATTACKS.A NOTE ABOUT THE WORD “SLIDE”—THIS DOES NOT MEAN YOUR FOOT DRAGS ALONG THEGROUND. YOUR LEFT FOOT SHOULD JUST GLIDE UP THE SAME DISTANCE THAT YOUR RIGHTFOOT MOVED. IN BOTH CASES, YOU LIFT YOUR FEET JUST ENOUGH TO CLEAR THE GROUND.REMEMBER FOOTWORK MUST BE ECONOMICAL.WHEN PRACTICING THE STEP AND SLIDE YOUR MAIN OBJECTIVE SHOULD BE PRECISION. YOUWANT TO BE IN THE STANCE AT ALL TIMES. IF YOUR RIGHT FOOT MOVES 2 INCHESFORWARD, YOUR LEFT SHOULD FOLLOW BY 2 INCHES. IN THE BEGINNING, CHECK YOURSTANCE AFTER EVERY STEP. ARE YOU ALIGNED PROPERLY? DID YOUR STANCE END EXACTLYTHE WAY YOU STARTED? IF NOT, MAKE THE REQUIRED ADJUSTMENTS AND TAKE THE TIME TOGET THE FEEL OF THE CORRECT STANCE. TRY AGAIN. WITH PRACTICE, YOU WILL SOON LANDIN THE ON-GUARD POSITION WITHOUT HAVING TO MAKE ANY ADJUSTMENTS. SEE FIGURES 74AND 75.[../Images/114a.jpg]FIGURE 74: THE STEP AND SLIDE FROM THE ON-GUARD POSITION.[../Images/115a.jpg]FIGURE 75: WHATEVER DISTANCE THE RIGHT FOOT ADVANCES, THE LEFT FOOT MUST FOLLOWUP AN EQUAL DISTANCE SO THAT THE INTEGRITY OF THE STANCE IS MAINTAINED.T H E P U S H S T E PTHE PUSH STEP IS A QUICKER WAY OF ADVANCING THAN THE STEP AND SLIDE. THE STEPAND SLIDE IS A TWO-STEP PROCESS. FIRST YOU STEP, AND THEN YOU SLIDE. THE STEP ISINITIATED WITH THE FRONT FOOT.THE PUSH STEP, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS INITIATED WITH THE LEFT FOOT. YOU AREPUSHING OFF THE GROUND WITH THE BALL OF YOUR LEFT FOOT. COMPARED TO THE STEP ANDSLIDE, THERE IS MUCH LESS TIME BETWEEN THE LANDING OF THE RIGHT HEEL AND THEBALL OF YOUR LEFT FOOT. YOU GENERATE MORE FORCE WITH THE PUSH STEP, AND,THEREFORE, IT IS THE PUSH STEP—NOT THE STEP AND SLIDE—THAT IS USED FOR QUICKERADVANCES AND EVASIONS.17AS IS ALWAYS THE CASE WITH FOOTWORK, PRECISION IS PRIORITY. EVERY TIME YOU PUSHSTEP, YOU SHOULD FINISH IN THE STANCE—JUST AS YOU STARTED. IT’S IMPORTANT TOREMEMBER THAT EVEN THOUGH THE PUSH STEP IS EXPLOSIVE, IT NEEDS TO BE CONTROLLED.IT’S A QUIET MOTION THAT REQUIRES A CLEAN LANDING. MY STUDENTS HAVE ALL KINDS OFDESCRIPTIONS FOR THE PUSH-OFF. EVERYTHING FROM BUNNY HOPS TO CRICKET JUMPS TONINJA-LIKE, BUT MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE DESCRIPTION IS THAT OF A RAT PISSING ONLINT COTTON! A BIT GRAPHIC, BUT YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THAT’S GOTTA BE PRETTY QUIET.PUSH -OFF VERSUS PUSH STEPWE’VE DISCUSSED THE PUSH-OFF IN DETAIL IN CHAPTER FOUR. I’D JUST LIKE TO DRAW ABIT OF A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE PUSH STEP AND THE PUSH-OFF. THE PUSH-OFF MIGHTBE CONSIDERED THE PUSH STEP TAKEN TO THE NEXT DEGREE. THIS IS WHERE YOU’LLGENERATE THE EXPLOSIVENESS NEEDED TO LAUNCH PUNCHES. THINK OF THE DIFFERENCE ININTENSITY BETWEEN A FEELER JAB AND A STIFF ONE. YOU WOULD PROBABLY USE THE PUSHSTEP FOR THE FEELER AND THE PUSH-OFF TO FIRE A STIFF JAB.I CAN’T OVEREMPHASIZE THIS NOTION OF EXPLOSIVENESS. I’VE ALREADY REFERENCED NADIAND BRUCE’S DESCRIPTIONS OF THE LEFT FOOT: PISTON, COBRA, SPARK PLUG, ENGINE,AND MY FAVORITE—“ONE OF THE MIGHTIEST SPRINGS IN ALL CREATION.” THERE’S GOODREASON FOR SUCH VIVID AND SEEMINGLY DRAMATIC DESCRIPTIONS. THE INTENSITY ANDPOWER OF EXPLOSIVE PUNCHING ORIGINATE FROM THE PUSH-OFF.T H E P I V O T S T E POBVIOUSLY, IN A FIGHT YOU DO NOT MOVE ONLY ALONG A LINEAR PLANE. YOU DON’T JUSTMOVE FORWARD AND BACKWARD AS FENCERS DO ALONG THE STRIP. THE PIVOT STEP ALLOWSYOU TO MOVE AT AN ANGLE AND IS OFTEN VERY USEFUL FOR DELIVERING BLOWS WHILEMOVING OUT OF HARM’S WAY.18TO PIVOT RIGHT, LIFT YOUR RIGHT FOOT JUST ENOUGH TO CLEAR THE GROUND. USE YOURRIGHT TOE AS A ROUGH POINTER. ONCE YOU ARE ALIGNED WITH THE TARGET, LET YOURRIGHT FOOT REST ON THE GROUND. THEN BRING YOUR LEFT FOOT AROUND SO THAT YOU AREBACK IN THE ON-GUARD POSITION.LIKEWISE, TO PIVOT LEFT, LIFT YOUR LEFT FOOT FIRST. SWING YOUR LEFT LEG AROUNDAND LET YOUR BODY TURN WITH IT. WHEN YOU’RE ALIGNED WITH THE TARGET, LET YOURLEFT FOOT REST ON THE GROUND. PICK UP YOUR RIGHT FOOT AND ANGLE IT UNTIL YOU AREIN THE CORRECT POSITION.AGAIN, YOU ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS WANT TO MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF THE STANCE.WHAT YOU ARE ESSENTIALLY DOING IS TAKING THE STANCE AND MERELY CHANGING YOURANGLE SO THAT YOU CAN MOVE WITH A MOVING OPPONENT AND KEEP HIM WITHIN STRIKINGDISTANCE. REMEMBER THE GUNSIGHT? YOU ALWAYS WANT TO MOVE TO KEEP YOUR OPPONENTWITHIN THE GUNSIGHT. SEE FIGURES 76 AND 77.[../Images/116a.jpg]FIGURE 76: PIVOT STEP STARTING FROM THE ON-GUARD POSITION.[../Images/117a.jpg]FIGURE 77: TO WHATEVER DEGREE YOUR FRONT FOOT PIVOTS, THE BACK FOOT MUST SWINGAROUND ENOUGH SO THAT YOU ARE ALIGNED WITH THE TARGET IN THE PROPER STANCE.THE PIVOT STEP CAN BE TRICKY IN THE BEGINNING. THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OFANTICIPATION, DISTANCE, AND MUSCLE MEMORY THAT MUST GO INTO PIVOTING WITHOUTHAVING TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS. IN THE BEGINNING, YOU WILL MOST LIKELY HAVE TO MAKEMINOR ADJUSTMENTS. JUST KNOW THAT THIS IS NATURAL AND THAT PRECISION WILL COMEWITH ENOUGH TIME AND PRACTICE.ALSO REMEMBER THAT THE DIRECTION IN WHICH YOU PIVOT IS ALWAYS THE FOOT THATCOMES OFF THE GROUND FIRST. SO, IF YOU WANT TO PIVOT TO THE RIGHT(COUNTERCLOCKWISE), YOU’LL PICK UP YOUR RIGHT FOOT FIRST. THEN THE LEFT (REAR)FOOT SWINGS AROUND SO THAT YOU ADJUST BACK INTO THE STANCE.IF YOU ARE PIVOTING LEFT (CLOCKWISE), PICK UP YOUR LEFT (REAR) FOOT FIRST, SWINGYOUR LEFT LEG AROUND, AND ADJUST BACK INTO THE STANCE BY PIVOTING YOUR RIGHT(FRONT) FOOT. ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT WHEN YOU PIVOT YOU WANT TO WIND UP IN THESTANCE WITH YOUR OPPONENT WITHIN YOUR GUNSIGHT. REMEMBER OUR IMAGINARY LINE FROMTHE STANCE CHAPTER? YOU ALWAYS WANT THAT LINE THAT RUNS FROM YOUR RIGHT TOE ANDUNDER YOUR LEFT ARCH TO BE IN LINE WITH THE TARGET.YOU’LL SEE QUITE A BIT OF PIVOTING IN RETURN OF THE DRAGON AS BRUCE MOVES AROUNDCHUCK NORRIS, EVADING, DUCKING, AND COUNTERING. YOU’LL NOTICE THAT PIVOTINGALLOWS HIM TO GET OUT OF THE WAY WHILE STAYING CLOSE ENOUGH TO DELIVER ANOFFENSIVE. YOU’LL ALSO SEE SOME OF THE VARIATIONS OF PIVOTING. AS I’VE JUSTMENTIONED, YOU CAN ADD UPPER BODY MOVES, SUCH AS DUCKING AND WEAVING, TO THEPIVOT STEP. BUT THERE ARE ALSO COUNTLESS FOOTWORK COMBINATIONS INVOLVING PIVOTSTEPPING. BY COMBINING PIVOTING WITH HALF-BEAT FOOTWORK, YOU GIVE YOURSELF MOREANGLES AND TIMING OPTIONS THAN MANY OTHER ARTS DO.A D V A N C E D F O O T W O R KTHE PUSH-OFF IS THE STARTING POINT FOR THROWING THE STRAIGHT LEAD, BUT IN THEHEAT OF BATTLE, YOU DON’T ALWAYS HAVE THE LUXURY OF SETTING UP IN THE STANCE INITS PUREST FORM. MAYBE YOU’RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A STEP AND SLIDE WHEN A STRIKINGOPPORTUNITY OPENS UP. OR YOU MIGHT BE MOVING BACKWARD. IN SUCH CASES, HOW DO YOUMANAGE TO FIRE OFF A STRAIGHT LEAD? AS IS USUALLY THE CASE, FOOTWORK IS THEANSWER.AGAIN, WE JUST CAN’T ADEQUATELY COVER THE TOPIC OF FOOTWORK HERE, BUT I WILLTOUCH ON A FEW STEPS TO GIVE YOU A SNEAK PREVIEW OF HOW THE STRAIGHT LEAD WORKSWHILE YOU ARE IN MOTION. IN AN ACTUAL FIGHTING OR SPARRING SITUATION, THEDIMENSION OF YOUR FOOTWORK CHANGES SO DRASTICALLY THAT THE MOST BASIC STEPS—THESTEP AND SLIDE, THE PUSH STEP, AND THE PIVOT—ACTUALLY TAKE A BACK SEAT. THEYBECOME THE SUPPLEMENTAL FOOTWORK, AND THE MORE ADVANCED STEPS— BOUNCING,HALF-BEATS, AND THE STEPS WE’LL DISCUSS SHORTLY—TAKE CENTER STAGE. THERE’S JUSTNO TIME IN A REAL FIGHT FOR WHOLE-BEAT FOOTWORK, SO THE BASIC STEPS BECOMEALMOST UNRECOGNIZABLE AS THEY ARE LINKED TO AND BLENDED WITH MORE ADVANCEDFOOTWORK.W E I G H T U P F R O N TWHEN YOU STEP AND SLIDE, EVEN THOUGH YOU STRIVE TO DISTRIBUTE YOUR WEIGHT 50-50,THERE IS A VERY BRIEF MOMENT WHEN YOUR WEIGHT IS SLIGHTLY SHIFTED TO YOUR FRONTFOOT, WHILE YOUR OTHER FOOT IS IN THE AIR ON ITS WAY TO TOUCHING THE GROUND. YOUNEED TO BE ABLE TO FIRE OFF A SHOT AT THE INSTANT AN OPPORTUNITY PRESENTSITSELF.IN SUCH CASES, YOU WILL MERELY TOUCH THE GROUND WITH YOUR RIGHT FOOT. THIS ISDIFFERENT FROM A REGULAR LANDING WHEN YOU ACTUALLY LET THAT WEIGHT SETTLE INTOTHE GROUND BEFORE ALLOWING THE LEFT FOOT TO LAND. NO, YOU WANT TO GET A SHOT OFFAS YOUR RIGHT FOOT IS ON THE GROUND. YOU CAN, BUT YOU MUST NOT ALLOW YOURSELF TOPUT YOUR WEIGHT INTO THAT FRONT FOOT. LIGHTLY TOUCH THE GROUND—JUST ENOUGH FORBALANCE—WITH YOUR FRONT FOOT SO THAT YOUR REAR FOOT CAN LAND, AND THENIMMEDIATELY PUSH OFF FOR AN ATTACK.P E N D U L U M S T E PTHE PENDULUM STEP IS A GREAT DEFENSIVE COUNTER. AS YOUR OPPONENT ADVANCES, YOUCAN DELIVER A STRAIGHT LEAD WITHOUT JAMMING YOURSELF, ALLOWING YOU TO MAINTAINLEVERAGE. THE PENDULUM IS OFTEN USED TO AVOID KICKS, BUT IT’S GOOD FOR WARDINGOFF ATTACKS IN GENERAL.19 TO EXECUTE THIS STEP FROM THE STANCE, YOU’LL SWINGYOUR LEAD LEG BACKWARD AS YOUR REAR LEG SWINGS IN THE SAME DIRECTION. YOU WILLPLACE YOUR RIGHT FOOT WHERE YOUR LEFT FOOT WAS. SOMETIMES WE REFER TO THIS AS A“REPLACEMENT” STEP. SEE FIGURES 78 AND 79.YOU’LL SEE BRUCE PENDULUM STEP ALL THE TIME IN HIS FILMS—AT THE BEGINNING OFENTER THE DRAGON WITH SAMMO HUNG, IN BATTLE WITH CHUCK NORRIS, AND IN THE GAMEOF DEATH FIGHT SEQUENCES.[../Images/119a.jpg]FIGURE 78: PENDULUM STEP FROM ON-GUARD POSITION.[../Images/119b.jpg]FIGURE 79: SWING YOUR FRONT LEG BACK AND LET GRAVITY DO THE WORK. YOU CAN USETHIS STEP TO EVADE KICKS OR THROW DEFENSIVE JABS.S T E A L I N G S T E PSOMETIMES YOU NEED A LITTLE EXTRA OOMPH TO BRIDGE THE GAP TO YOUR OPPONENT. YOUCAN GIVE YOURSELF A LITTLE EXTRA PUSH WITH WHAT WE CALL THE STEALING STEP. YOURLEFT FOOT WILL SLIDE FORWARD—QUICKLY—NO MORE THAN 3 OR 4 INCHES AND THEN YOUTAKE OFF. THIS LESSENS THE DISTANCE BETWEEN YOUR LEFT AND RIGHT FOOT AND GIVESYOU A LITTLE EXTRA LEVERAGE FROM WHICH TO PUSH OFF. THE VERY MOVEMENT OF THELEFT FOOT ALSO GIVES YOU A LITTLE EXTRA MOMENTUM. IT’S A VERY FAST, SUBTLEMOVEMENT—THINK HAIR TRIGGER. IT’S ALSO NOT SOMETHING YOU WOULD USE FROM ASTATIONARY STANCE BECAUSE THAT LITTLE EXTRA MOVEMENT TELEGRAPHS YOUR PUNCH. BUTIF YOU ARE ALREADY IN MOTION OR IN HOT PURSUIT, THE STEALING STEP CAN GET YOU ALITTLE MORE EXPLOSIVENESS AND DISTANCE AND MAKES FOR A MUCH MORE PENETRATINGATTACK. SEE FIGURES 80 THROUGH 82.[../Images/2.jpg]A P E E K A T O T H E R V A R I A T I O N SWE’VE ONLY COVERED A FEW WAYS TO LAUNCH A STRAIGHT LEAD MOVING EITHER FORWARD ORIN REVERSE. JUST KNOW THAT THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER WAYS TO USE FOOTWORK AND THELEAD HAND. YOU CAN SIDESTEP, CURVE, AND PIVOT, ALLOWING YOU TO ANGLE YOURPUNCHES. YOU CAN USE WHAT WE CALL THE “FANCY STEP” TO CHANGE DIRECTIONS QUICKLYAND WITH LITTLE EFFORT WHILE THROWING OUT A STRAIGHT. THESE STEPS ARE ALL LINKEDWITH BOUNCING AND HALF-BEAT STEPS. THE SKIP STEP GIVES YOU AN OPTION TO HITSHOULD YOU BE CAUGHT WITH ALL OF YOUR WEIGHT IN THE FRONT FOOT. THE STUTTER STEPIS A WAY TO PLAY WITH MOMENTUM AND TIMING.AND SPEAKING OF TIMING, THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF WAYS TO CREATE, BREAK, ANDSYNCOPATE RHYTHM TO CONFUSE YOUR OPPONENT. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGHFOOTWORK.S M A L L S T E P STHERE’S AN ENTIRE SECTION IN COMMENTARIES ON THE MARTIAL WAY THAT IS DEVOTED TOFOOTWORK AND THROUGHOUT IT YOU WILL FIND BRUCE’S EMPHASIS ON SMALL STEPS.FIRST, SMALL STEPS ARE EASIER TO CONTROL. A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK IF THEY COVERMORE DISTANCE WITH ONE STEP, THEY ARE BEING EFFICIENT. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS,THOUGH, IS THAT THE LONGER YOUR STRIDE, THE MORE TIME YOU SPEND IN A VULNERABLE,OFF-BALANCE POSITION. THE LARGER THE STEP, THE MORE YOU DEVIATE FROM THEON-GUARD POSITION. THIS WILL TAKE YOUR CENTER OF GRAVITY OUTSIDE THE FOUNDATIONBASE, SETTING YOU OFF-BALANCE. YOU WILL ALSO CREATE MORE MOMENTUM, MAKING ITDIFFICULT TO STOP ON A DIME, AND NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO REVERSE DIRECTIONS.IN ADDITION TO LACK OF CONTROL, LARGER MOVEMENTS TAKE YOU FURTHER OUT OFPOSITION FOR FOLLOW UPS OR COUNTERSTRIKES. IT COSTS YOU PRECIOUS TIME WHEN YOUDEVIATE UNNECESSARILY FROM THE STANCE.[../Images/121a.jpg]FIGURE 80: STEALING STEP FROM THE ON-GUARD POSITION.[../Images/121b.jpg]FIGURE 81: THE BACK FOOT ADVANCES NO MORE THAN A FEW INCHES GIVING YOU EXTRALEVERAGE. FROM THERE, YOU LAUNCH INTO THE PUSH-OFF...[../Images/122a.jpg]FIGURE 82:... AND LAND BACK IN THE STANCE.SMALL STEPS CONTRIBUTE TO EFFICIENCY. IT’S BETTER TO TAKE SEVERAL CONTROLLEDSMALL STEPS THAN ONE BIG STRIDE. SUPPOSE THAT YOU HAVE TO CHANGE DIRECTIONS. YOUCAN DO SO WITH SMALL STEPS. BUT IF YOU’RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT BIG STEP, YOU’LLHAVE TO WAIT LONGER TO COMPLETE IT SO YOU CAN TAKE ANOTHER ONE.ONE FINAL NOTE ABOUT SMALL STEPS—IT DOESN’T MEAN AIMLESS BOUNCING. SOME PEOPLEMISTAKE FOOTWORK FOR PURPOSELESS MOVEMENT. IF YOUR OPPONENT IS JITTERBUGGING INFRONT OF YOU AT A SAFE DISTANCE, FINE, LET HIM WEAR HIMSELF OUT. YOU DON’T HAVETO JOIN HIM. RELAX. YOU BOUNCE ONLY WHEN YOU NEED TO—WHEN YOUR OPPONENT’S ABOUTTO CLOSE IN, WHEN YOU NEED TO REGAIN SOME BALANCE OR CHANGE DIRECTION QUICKLY.BUT YOU JUST DON’T BOUNCE IN PLACE FOR THE SAKE OF BOUNCING.REMEMBER ECONOMY IS ONE OF THE JKD ROOTS:“ECONOMICAL FOOTWORK IS THE SOUNDEST KIND, AND THE JEET KUNE DO MAN’S AIM SHOULDALWAYS BE TO MOVE AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE.”20[../Images/2.jpg]S U P P L E M E N T A L T R A I N I N GONE OF THE MOST USEFUL TOOLS FOR GETTING LIGHT ON YOUR FEET IS THE JUMP ROPE.SKIPPING NOT ONLY DEVELOPS THE ENDURANCE YOU NEED—ESPECIALLY IN THOSE ARCHES—BUTIT IS ALSO A GREAT TRAINING TOOL FOR BODY CONTROL. NOTHING GETS YOU LIGHT ONYOUR FEET FASTER THAN SKIPPING. YOU’LL LEARN HOW TO NEGOTIATE YOUR BODY WEIGHTIN MOTION, WHILE DEVELOPING MUSCULAR AND CARDIOVASCULAR ENDURANCE.21, 22[../Images/123a.jpg]FIGURE 83: SKIPPING ROPE IS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO SUPPLEMENT YOUR FOOTWORKTRAINING.[../Images/2.jpg]N O S U B S T I T U T E F O R T H E R E A L T H I N GOF COURSE, THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO GET GOOD AT SOMETHING THAN BY DOING THEACTUAL THING. ALL THE RUNNING AND LEG PRESSES IN THE WORLD AREN’T GOING TORESULT IN GOOD FOOTWORK, BECAUSE YOU NEED TO DO THE NEUROMUSCULAR PROGRAMMING.THERE’S JUST NO WAY AROUND THIS. YOU HAVE TO PRACTICE FOOTWORK.AND ONCE YOU FEEL PRETTY COMFORTABLE ON YOUR FEET, THE NEXT STEP IS TO ADD THEUPPER BODY INTO THE EQUATION BY SHADOWBOXING. TED WONG STRESSES THAT THIS IS THEBEST THING YOU CAN DO FOR YOUR FOOTWORK23 BECAUSE IT’S CLOSER TO WHAT YOU’DACTUALLY BE DOING IN A FIGHT. IF YOU THROW OUT A STRAIGHT LEAD, YOU’LL NEED TOPROPERLY RECOVER BEFORE YOU CAN SHOOT OUT ANOTHER. YOU ALSO NEED TO LEARN THEFOOTWORK THAT’S GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO FIRE A STRAIGHT LEAD COMING OUT OF ASHOULDER ROLL, BOB, OR WEAVE. AND IF YOU’RE CHASING AN OPPONENT, YOU NEED TOKNOW HOW FOOTWORK WILL ENABLE YOU TO BRIDGE THE GAP. SHADOWBOXING MAKES ALL OFTHIS POSSIBLE.THIS IS WHERE YOUR BODY GETS TO EXPERIMENT. YOU’LL LEARN HOW TO BEST ADJUST YOURBODY WEIGHT WHILE IN MOTION. I’VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT BODY FEEL IN THEDISCUSSION OF THE STANCE. SHADOWBOXING IS WHERE YOU ACQUIRE BODY FEEL IN MOTION.HAVE FUN WITH IT. ACQUIRING NEW SKILLS SHOULD BE AN ENJOYABLE PROCESS,ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU START TO FEEL BALANCED AND IN CONTROL OF YOUR BODY. THERE ISA CERTAIN SATISFACTION AND POWER YOU SHOULD DERIVE FROM THAT KIND OF CONTROL.[../Images/124a.jpg]FIGURE 84: EVEN WHEN HITTING THE BAG, FOOTWORK SHOULD BE YOUR FIRST PRIORITY.[../Images/2.jpg]P R E C I S I O NWHEN PRACTICING FOOTWORK, PRECISION IS THE NAME OF THE GAME. ALWAYS AIM TOMAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF THE STANCE. IF YOU STEP FORWARD 3 INCHES WITH THERIGHT FOOT, MAKE SURE YOUR LEFT FOOT SLIDES UP 3 INCHES. IN THE BEGINNING, EVERYTIME YOU TAKE A STEP, STOP. CHECK YOUR ALIGNMENT. IS THAT IMAGINARY LINE THATTOUCHES YOUR RIGHT TOE PASSING UNDER THE ARCH OF YOUR LEFT FOOT? IF NOT, YOUNEED TO CORRECT THE POSITION OF YOUR FEET.THIS MAY SOUND A BIT OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE, BUT REMEMBER THAT WHEN LEARNING NEWTECHNIQUES, ALL SORTS OF NEUROMUSCULAR CONNECTIONS ARE BEING MADE. IF YOURPRACTICE IS SLOPPY, YOU WILL BE PROGRAMMING INCORRECTLY. AND UNLEARNING ANDCORRECTING BAD HABITS IS MORE DIFFICULT AND TIME-CONSUMING THAN LEARNING ATECHNIQUE RIGHT THE FIRST TIME AROUND.FOOTWORK IS ANYTHING BUT BORING. THIS IS WHERE YOU CULTIVATE BODY FEEL. THIS ISWHERE IT ALL STARTS—WHERE YOU LEARN TO SHIFT YOUR WEIGHT SO THAT YOU FEELCOMFORTABLE AND BALANCED IN MOTION. AS I’VE DISCUSSED, PUNCHES ARE GENERATEDFROM THE GROUND UP. ALIGNMENT STARTS WITH THE FEET. YOU CANNOT EXPECT TOGENERATE FORCEFUL PUNCHES WITH SLOPPY FOOTWORK. BEFORE YOU CAN MOVE ON TOPUNCHING, SPEED AND MORE ADVANCED FOOTWORK, YOU NEED TO START WITH THE BASICS.CHECK YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR, DRAW LINES WITH CHALK, USE THE PATTERNS ON YOURKITCHEN LINOLEUM—WHATEVER YOU CAN IN THE NAME OF PRECISION. WHAT WE ARE TRYINGTO DO IS PROGRAM THOSE NEUROMUSCULAR PATHWAYS SO THAT IT WILL BECOME SECONDNATURE. SOON YOUR BODY WILL KNOW WHEN IT’S IN CORRECT ALIGNMENT. AND AFTER THAT,IT WILL KNOW HOW TO GET THERE WITH FEWER AND FEWER ADJUSTMENTS UNTIL NO MOREADJUSTMENTS ARE NEEDED. THAT’S THE KIND OF EFFICIENCY YOU SHOULD STRIVE FOR.THIS ISN’T JUST FOR BEGINNERS EITHER. YOU CAN NEVER BE TOO PRECISE.A MATTER OF AN INCH OR TWO MAY NOT SEEM LIKE MUCH, BUT REMEMBER HOW MUCH OF ADIFFERENCE IT MADE IN OUR EXPERIMENT WITH THE STANCE. YOUR ALIGNMENT MAY NOT BESPOT ON IN COMBAT, BUT THE CLOSER YOU ARE, THE BETTER YOU’LL BE. YOU’LL HAVETHAT MUCH MORE ADVANTAGE OVER YOUR OPPONENT. YOU MAY THINK I’M SPLITTING HAIRSHERE, THAT FOOTWORK IS BORING, AND THAT I’M A BIT OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE ABOUTPRECISION, SO I’D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO CLOSE THIS CHAPTER WITH A FEW WORDSFROM BASKETBALL GREAT, COACH JOHN WOODEN:> THESE SEEMINGLY TRIVIAL MATTERS, TAKEN TOGETHER AND ADDED TO MANY, MANY OTHER> SO-CALLED TRIVIAL MATTERS BUILD INTO SOMETHING VERY BIG: NAMELY, YOUR SUCCESS.> > YOU WILL FIND THAT SUCCESS AND ATTENTION TO DETAILS, THE SMALLEST DETAILS,> USUALLY GO HAND IN HAND, IN BASKETBALL AND ELSEWHERE IN YOUR LIFE.> > WHEN YOU SEE A SUCCESSFUL INDIVIDUAL, A CHAMPION, A “WINNER,” YOU CAN BE VERY> SURE THAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT AN INDIVIDUAL WHO PAYS GREAT ATTENTION TO THE> PERFECTION OF MINOR DETAILS.24I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT BRUCE LEE PAID ATTENTION TO THOSE DETAILS, AND I’M SURE HEWAS NEVER BORED WHEN PRACTICING FOOTWORK.

NOW IT’S TIME TO ADDRESS THE WHYS OF THE STRAIGHT LEADAND DELVE A LITTLE INTO FIGHTING SCIENCE. IN THIS CHAPTER, THERE’LL BE A BIT OFOVERLAP WITH THE EARLIER DISCUSSION OF MECHANICS AND WITH THE NEXT CHAPTER,WHICH DEALS WITH APPLICATION.IN HIS COPY OF EDWIN HAISLET’S BOXING, BRUCE LEE OUTLINED SOME OF THE ADVANTAGESOF THE STRAIGHT LEAD:1. FASTER—THE SHORTEST DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO POINTS IS A STRAIGHT LINE2. MORE ACCURATE—LESS CHANCE OF MISSING AND IS SURER THAN OTHER PUNCHES3. GREATER FREQUENCY OF HITS—MORE DAMAGE CAN BE DONE4. BALANCE IS LESS DISTURBED—SAFER5. SAFER, SURER, AND EASIER6. LESS INJURIOUS TO ONE’S HAND1, 2, 3[../Images/2.jpg]F A S T E RLET’S START WITH THE FIRST ITEM ON BRUCE’S LIST. THE STRAIGHT LEAD IS THEFASTEST POSSIBLE PUNCH FOR SEVERAL REASONS, THE FIRST OF WHICH IS A SIMPLEMATTER OF GEOMETRY—THE SHORTEST DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO POINTS IS A STRAIGHT LINE.A STRAIGHT PUNCH WILL ALWAYS BEAT A CURVING, HOOKING, OR SWINGING PUNCH.YOU’LL FIND REMINDERS OF THIS BASIC FACT REPEATED OVER AND OVER FROM JKD’S MAJORBOXING INFLUENCES—DEMPSEY, DRISCOLL, AND HAISLET.4 AS DRISCOLL DRYLY STATED:> THERE IS SURELY NO NEED TO REFER TO EUCLID FOR CONFIRMATION OF THE OBVIOUS> FACT THAT THE SHORTEST DISTANCE BETWEEN ANY TWO POINTS MUST OF NECESSITY BE> THE STRAIGHT LINE BETWEEN THEM. EVERY BOXER, NO MATTER HOW SMALL HIS> INTELLIGENCE OTHERWISE, MUST AT ONCE ADMIT AS MUCH—WITH, OF COURSE, THE> NATURAL SEQUEL THAT A STRAIGHT PUNCH MUST ALWAYS GET HOME BEFORE A ROUND ARM> SWINGING ONE, PROVIDED, OF COURSE, THAT BOTH START AT THE SAME TIME.5TO THIS I’D LIKE TO ADD THAT A SKILLED EXECUTOR OF THE STRAIGHT MAY EVEN LAND ASHOT BEFORE A SWINGING PUNCH EVEN IF IT IS INITIATED AFTER THE SWING, PROVIDEDTHAT TIMING, ACCURACY, AND SOUND MECHANICS ARE ALL IN PLACE. SEE FIGURE 85.[../Images/129a.jpg]FIGURE 85: THE STRAIGHT ALWAYS WINS. HERE, TED WONG’S CORKSCREW HOOK (AVARIATION OF THE STRAIGHT LEAD) WILL LAND LONG BEFORE MY HOOK WILL.DEMPSEY MADE A SIMILAR ARGUMENT ALSO NOTING THAT A STRAIGHT PUNCH FROM EITHERTHE FRONT OR REAR HAND WOULD BEAT A PUNCH WITH AN ARC.6, 7 THE STRAIGHT-LINEARGUMENT MAY BE COMMON SENSE, AND IN DEMPSEY’S DAY, THIS WAS CONSIDERED COMMONKNOWLEDGE, BUT IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN AMONG TODAY’S LESS EDUCATEDPUNCHERS.IT ISN’T JUST THE STRAIGHT LINE THAT MAKES THE LEAD PUNCH FAST. WHEN YOU ALIGNYOURSELF PROPERLY IN THE STANCE, YOUR LEAD HAND IS CLOSER TO THE TARGET. ASBRUCE OBSERVED, “IT IS A POTENT OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE WEAPON BECAUSE OF ITSADVANCED POSITION—IT IS HALFWAY TO THE TARGET BEFORE STARTING.”8AND WHILE DEMPSEY’S ORTHODOX STANCE WAS SET UP WITH THE STRONG (RIGHT) HAND INTHE BACK, HE STRESSED THE MORE IMPORTANT ROLE THAT THE LEAD HAND PLAYS, MAINLYBECAUSE OF ITS PROXIMITY TO THE TARGET.9 THE COMBINED EFFECT OF HITTING IN ASTRAIGHT LINE AND WITH THE HAND THAT IS IN AN ADVANCED POSITION NOT ONLY ENABLESYOU TO THROW THE LEAD PUNCH FASTER—IT TAKES LESS EFFORT TO DO SO. SO WHILE WE’REON THE SUBJECT OF ECONOMY OF MOTION, LET’S SKIP TO ITEM NUMBER FOUR ON OUR LISTOF STRAIGHT LEAD ADVANTAGES.[../Images/2.jpg]B A L A N C E I S L E S S D I S T U R B E DWE’VE ALREADY ESTABLISHED THE SOLIDITY OF THE JKD STANCE. WE’VE DISCUSSEDNEWTON’S LAW OF ACTION AND REACTION, AND WE’VE TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OFBALANCE AND CENTER OF GRAVITY AND HOW TO MAINTAIN BALANCE WHILE IN MOTION.LOOKING AT THE BIGGER PICTURE, THOUGH, IT’S IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT THE STANCEIS ACTUALLY SET UP FOR THE STRAIGHT LEAD. THE JKD ON-GUARD POSITION ISCONSTRUCTED SO THAT WE CAN THROW THE STRAIGHT LEAD WITH THE LEAST DEVIATION FROMTHE STANCE.BECAUSE THE LEAD HAND HAS LESS DISTANCE TO TRAVEL TO THE TARGET, THE STRAIGHTLEAD GIVES US THE ADVANTAGE OF “ECONOMY OF TIME AND BALANCE.”10, 11, 12 ASHORTER DISTANCE TO THE TARGET MEANS LESS DEVIATION FROM THE STANCE, LESSRECOVERY TIME, AND FASTER FOLLOW-UP PUNCHES. AND, OF COURSE, LESS DISRUPTION OFBALANCE MEANS BETTER MOBILITY, SUCCESSFUL EVASION AND COUNTERS, AND THE ABILITYTO GET OFF MORE SHOTS.AS DRISCOLL NOTED, “IF ONE MISSES WITH A HUGE SWING, OR “HAYMAKER,” AS THEAMERICANS TERM IT, ONE IS PRACTICALLY CERTAIN TO BECOME UNBALANCED, ANDCONSEQUENTLY AT THE MERCY OF ONE’S OPPONENT.”13 I SUGGEST YOU TRY THIS OUT WITHA LITTLE FOCUS MITT DRILL. THE MITT HOLDER SHOULD OCCASIONALLY CAUSE THE PUNCHERTO MISS STRAIGHT LEADS AND HOOKS. EVEN IF YOU ARE THROWING YOUR STRAIGHT LEADSAND HOOKS CORRECTLY, YOU SHOULD NOTICE THAT IT TAKES MUCH MORE EFFORT TO RECOVERFROM A MISSED HOOK.[../Images/2.jpg]N O N T E L E G R A P H I CIT’S NOT ON BRUCE’S LIST, BUT ECONOMICAL PROPERTIES OF THE STRAIGHT LEAD GIVE USAN OBVIOUS COROLLARY: THE STRAIGHT LEAD IS THE LEAST TELEGRAPHIC PUNCH IN THEJKD ARSENAL. LESS DISTANCE MEANS LESS EFFORT, LESS DEVIATION FROM THE STANCE,AND LESS TIME. LESS TIME MEANS LESS WARNING. YOUR OPPONENT LITERALLY WILL NEVERKNOW WHAT HIT HIM.BOTH DEMPSEY AND BRUCE HAD A LOT TO SAY ABOUT BEING NONTELEGRAPHIC.14, 15DRISCOLL WROTE THAT NOT ONLY IS A SWINGING PUNCH SLOWER TO REACH A TARGET, IT’SVIRTUALLY ONE BIG TELEGRAPH.16 EVEN IF A FIGHTER’S MOST FORCEFUL PUNCH IS ASWINGING ONE, WHAT GOOD IS IT IF HIS OPPONENT CAN SEE IT COMING A MILE AWAY?THAT LEAVES YOUR OPPONENT PLENTY OF TIME TO GET OUT OF THE WAY, OR WORSE, SEND ADEADLY COUNTER.IT’S NOT JUST THAT THE SWINGING PUNCH MUST TRAVEL A GREATER DISTANCE THAN THESTRAIGHT. THE ANGLE FROM WHICH THE STRAIGHT ORIGINATES MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULTTO DETECT. THINK ABOUT IT. A SWINGING PUNCH MUST TRAVERSE FROM LEFT TO RIGHT ORVICE VERSA ACROSS YOUR FIELD OF VISION. SIMILARLY, WITH AN UPPERCUT, YOU’LL SEEAN ARM AND A FIST MOVE VERTICALLY. ALL YOU SEE WHEN FACING A STRAIGHT LEAD,THOUGH, IS A FIST FROM A CERTAIN DISTANCE—AND THEN A FIST IN YOUR FACE!SEE FIGURES 86 THROUGH 89.[../Images/131a.jpg]FIGURE 86: THE STRAIGHT GIVES NO WARNING. FIRST THERE’S A FIST AT A DISTANCE...[../Images/132a.jpg]FIGURE 87:... THEN THERE’S A FIST IN YOUR FACE.[../Images/132b.jpg]FIGURE 88: IN CONTRAST TO STRAIGHT PUNCHING, HOOK PUNCHING REVEALS MUCH MOREACROSS YOUR FIELD OF VISION.[../Images/133a.jpg]FIGURE 89: YOU WILL ACTUALLY SEE YOUR OPPONENT’S FIST MOVE LEFT OR RIGHT, GIVINGYOU MORE TIME TO EVADE OR COUNTER.[../Images/2.jpg]A C C U R A C YGETTING BACK TO BRUCE’S LIST, THE STRAIGHT LEAD GIVES US MORE CONTROL ANDACCURACY THAN OTHER PUNCHES. ALL THE ISSUES OF BALANCE, RECOVERY, TELEGRAPHING,AND DISTANCE CONTRIBUTE TO GREATER ACCURACY OF THE STRAIGHT LEAD. THE STRAIGHTALSO ALLOWS FOR FULL EXTENSION OF THE ARM.17 AS I’VE ALREADY NOTED, THE RELATIVESLOWNESS OF ARCING PUNCHES GIVES YOUR OPPONENT TIME TO RECOGNIZE THE PUNCH ANDGET OUT OF THE WAY, AND IF YOUR OPPONENT IS MOVING AWAY, THE SHORTER REACHAFFORDED BY A HOOK OR SWING MAKES A SUCCESSFUL LANDING LESS LIKELY.18IT’S HELPFUL HERE TO REMEMBER THE ANALOGOUS EVOLUTION OF SWORD FIGHTING AND THEEVENTUAL PREFERENCE OF THE RAPIER OVER THE BROADSWORD. ACCURATE THRUSTINGTHROUGH THE SMALL VULNERABLE SPOTS BETWEEN PLATES OF METAL ARMOR PROVED MUCHMORE EFFECTIVE THAN TRYING TO SLASH THROUGH ARMOR.19 DRISCOLL ARGUED THAT THEEVOLUTION OF THE STRAIGHT LEAD HAD FOLLOWED IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE RAPIER:> THE “BEAR-CAT” BRIGADE ARE BLUDGEON FIGHTERS, WHO DISDAIN THE USE OF THE> RAPIER, FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT THEY ARE UTTERLY IGNORANT OF THE FINER> POINTS OF THE GAME. YET THE WHOLE HISTORY OF SINGLE COMBAT REFUTES THEIR> ARGUMENT. MAN DID NOT ABANDON THE CLUB AS A WEAPON BECAUSE HE PREFERRED THE> RAPIER AS A PARLOUR PASTIME, BUT BECAUSE THE SWORD PROVED ITSELF TO BE THE> MORE USEFUL WEAPON. AND IT WAS A SIMILAR PROCESS OF DISCOVERY THAT THE AXE,> WHICH HAD SUPERSEDED THE CLUB, GAVE WAY TO THE SWORD AND THE BUCKLER, THEN TO> THE CASE SWORDS, UNTIL EVEN THE BROADSWORD AND SABRE WERE ABANDONED IN FAVOUR> OF THE RAPIER.20DRISCOLL ARGUED THAT UNEDUCATED SPECTATORS WERE ATTRACTED TO THE DRAMA OF THESWINGING PUNCH AND THE BROAD STROKES OF THE SABER. THE SAME COULD BE SAID OFTODAY’S BLOODY BRAWLERS AND STAGED FILM FIGHTS. SWINGS ARE EASY FOR PEOPLE TOSEE. THEY LOOK GOOD FOR THE CAMERA. BUT IN A COMPETITIVE OR MORE REALISTICSITUATION, YOU DON’T WANT YOUR OPPONENT TO SEE YOU! YOU DON’T WANT HIM TO KNOWWHAT HIT HIM.GETTING BACK TO THE SUBJECT OF ACCURACY, A SWINGING PUNCH IS MUCH HARDER TOCONTROL, AND THEREFORE, MUCH HARDER TO AIM ACCURATELY. WHEN YOU THROW A HOOK,IT’S VERY HARD TO CHANGE DIRECTIONS. ONCE YOU’VE COMMITTED TO MOVING, SAY, LEFTOR RIGHT, THAT’S IT. ALSO REMEMBER HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO RECOVER TO THEON-GUARD POSITION FROM A SWINGING PUNCH. BUT THE COMPACTNESS OF THE STRAIGHTLEAD AND ITS STRAIGHT-AS-AN-ARROW TRAJECTORY MAKE IT EASIER TO CHANGEDIRECTIONS, EVEN IN MID-PUNCH. BY USING FOOTWORK, YOU CAN MAKE MINOR ADJUSTMENTSAND STILL HIT A FAST-MOVING TARGET.AND WHILE A STRAIGHT LEAD MAY HAVE SLIGHTLY LESS FORCE THAN A HAYMAKER, WHATGOOD IS HAVING A HAYMAKER IF YOU CAN NEVER LAND ONE? OF COURSE, MISSING AHAYMAKER LEAVES YOU IN A VERY VULNERABLE POSITION FOR COUNTERS. A PERFECT,STIFF, STRAIGHT LEAD, ON THE OTHER HAND, DELIVERS MORE THAN ENOUGH FORCE TO GETTHE JOB DONE, AND IT CAN DO SO MORE OFTEN (SEE FIGURE 90). WHICH LEADS TO THENEXT ITEM ON THE LIST....[../Images/2.jpg]G R E A T E R F R E Q U E N C Y O F H I T SBUILDING ON WHAT I’VE ALREADY DISCUSSED, A FASTER, NONTELEGRAPHIC, MOREACCURATE, AND CLOSER-TO-THE-TARGET PUNCH MEANS THAT YOU’RE GOING TO BE ABLE TOLAND MORE OFTEN, AND AS BRUCE WROTE, “MORE DAMAGE CAN BE DONE.”21 ALSO, THEEFFICIENCY INVOLVED IN DELIVERING THE PUNCH CONTRIBUTES TO FASTER RECOVERY, SOYOU CAN FIRE MORE SHOTS. THE EFFICIENCY DOESN’T ONLY OCCUR IN TERMS OF TIME ANDMOTION. WITH MORE CONTROLLED RECOVERY AND MINIMIZED DEVIATION FROM THE STANCE,COUPLED WITH PROPER MECHANICS, YOU’LL BECOME FATIGUED LESS EASILY. YOU COULDTHROW STRAIGHT LEADS ALL DAY.GREATER FREQUENCY OF HITS GETS YOUR OPPONENT OFF BALANCE, PUTS HIM ON THEDEFENSIVE, AND CREATES MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU TO FINISH HIM OFF.22 OFCOURSE, A PROPERLY THROWN SINGLE STRAIGHT LEAD CAN PACK MORE THAN ENOUGH WALLOPON ITS OWN TO FINISH AN OPPONENT.[../Images/135a.jpg]FIGURE 90: WORKING ON THE FOCUS MITTS IS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO DEVELOPACCURACY.[../Images/2.jpg]L E S S I N J U R I O U S T O O N E ’ S H A N D SI’VE COVERED THIS ALREADY IN THE CHAPTER ON MECHANICS. REMEMBER THE EXPERIMENTWITH DEMPSEY’S POWER LINE AND HOW MUCH MORE STABLE YOUR WRIST WAS WHEN YOU MADECONTACT WITH THE BOTTOM THREE KNUCKLES INSTEAD OF THE TOP TWO. AGAIN, THIS IS ASIMPLE MATTER OF HUMAN ANATOMY. STRAIGHT HITTING WITH THE THUMB UP ALLOWS YOU TOTAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE POWER LINE THAT RUNS FROM YOUR SHOULDER THROUGH YOUR ARMTO THOSE BOTTOM THREE KNUCKLES.23 YOU’LL NOT ONLY HIT WITH MORE FORCE BUT ALSOPREVENT HAND INJURIES BY KEEPING THE WRONG KNUCKLES FROM BEARING EXCESSIVE FORCEON IMPACT.24DRISCOLL ADDED THAT SWINGERS COULD EXPECT SHORTER FIGHTING CAREERS BECAUSE THEYPUT THEIR HANDS AT UNNECESSARY RISK. HE ARGUED THAT THE ACCURACY OF THE STRAIGHTPUNCH INCREASED THE FREQUENCY OF LANDING WITH THE BOTTOM THREE KNUCKLES, PUTTINGTHE BOXER IN THE BEST POSITION TO DISTRIBUTE THE ABSORPTION OF IMPACT. THESWINGING PUNCH, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAS A LESS LIKELY CHANCE OF LANDING SQUARELY,PUTTING THE HAND AT GREATER RISK.IT FOLLOWS, THEN, THAT THE STRAIGHT PUNCH PLAYS A LARGE PART IN CONTRIBUTING TOA FIGHTER’S LONGEVITY. “THE SWINGER’S HANDS OR WRISTS,” DEMPSEY WROTE, “MUST GOIN TIME, AND IN SHORT TIME AT THAT.”25[../Images/2.jpg]S A F E R, S U R E R, E A S I E RGOING DOWN BRUCE’S CHECKLIST SO FAR, WE’VE DISCUSSED HOW THE STRAIGHT IS SURERIN ACCURACY, EASIER IN TERMS OF MECHANICS, DISTANCE, RECOVERY, AND BALANCE, ANDSAFER IN ITS STRUCTURE, WHICH PROTECTS THE STRIKING HAND.LET’S TAKE THIS SAFETY ISSUE ONE STEP FURTHER, THOUGH, AND TALK ABOUT HOW ALLTHE STRAIGHT LEAD ADVANTAGES THUS FAR CONTRIBUTE TO WHAT DEMPSEY CALLED“AGGRESSIVE DEFENCE.”[../Images/2.jpg]“ P U N C H R A N K S F I R S T ”IN THESE TIMES OF BIG-MONEY SPORTS AND PAY-PER-VIEW BLOODBATH EXTRAVAGANZAS,IT’S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS A TIME WHEN BOXING WAS CONSIDERED THE“USEFUL SCIENCE OF DEFENCE.”26 THAT THE ORIGINAL PURPOSE OF BOXING HAD BEENFORGOTTEN WAS WHAT COMPELLED BOTH DRISCOLL AND DEMPSEY TO WRITE THE STRAIGHTLEFT AND HOW TO CULTIVATE IT AND CHAMPIONSHIP FIGHTING: EXPLOSIVE PUNCHING ANDAGGRESSIVE DEFENCE, RESPECTIVELY. IT’S NO COINCIDENCE THAT DEMPSEY INCLUDED THEWORDS “AGGRESSIVE DEFENCE” IN THE TITLE, FOR ITS NEGLECT IS SOMETHING THATINFURIATED HIM.27AT PRESENT, IT SEEMS THINGS HAVEN’T CHANGED FOR THE BETTER, BUT AT LEAST IT’SCOMFORTING TO KNOW THAT DRISCOLL COMPLAINED OF THE SAME THINGS IN THE 1920S,BLAMING “DECADENCE IN BOXING” ON THE LOST ART OF DEFENSE. DRISCOLL WROTE THATOFFENSE AND DEFENSE ARE INEXTRICABLY LINKED BUT THAT THE LATTER HAD BEENFORGOTTEN:> BOXING IS, AFTER ALL, THE ART OF SELF-DEFENCE FIRST, LAST, AND ALL THE TIME,> AND THAT SUCCESS IS ONLY TO BE WON BY REMEMBERING THAT DEFENCE IS NOT ONLY THE> CHIEF THING TO BE CONSIDERED, BUT THAT ATTACK CAN ONLY BE ALLOWED TO COME INTO> THE PICTURE AT ALL WHEN IT IS EMPLOYED AS AN AUXILIARY TO DEFENCE, AND IN THE> OLD SENSE THAT THE STRONGEST FORM OF DEFENCE IS A VIGOROUS ATTACK, CARRIED OUT> MAINLY AND ALMOST ENTIRELY WITH A VIEW TO THE MINIMIZING OF THE RISK, OR THE> REPULSE OF ALL COUNTER ATTACK.28SIMILARLY, DEMPSEY SO BELIEVED IN THE STRAIGHT PUNCH AS A MEANS OF DEFENSE THATHE STRUCTURED HIS BOOK AROUND IT, CHOOSING TO PAINSTAKINGLY DESCRIBE THEMECHANICS OF PUNCHING BEFORE EVER DESCRIBING A SINGLE DEFENSIVE MOVE. HE THENINTRODUCED THE SECTION ON DEFENSE WITH A CHAPTER ENTITLED “PUNCH RANKS FIRST” TOEXPLAIN THAT THE STRAIGHT PUNCH IS THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE.“THE BEST DEFENCE IN FIGHTING IS AN AGGRESSIVE DEFENCE,” HE WROTE. “EACHDEFENSIVE MOVE MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY A COUNTERPUNCH OR BE FOLLOWED IMMEDIATELYBY A COUNTERPUNCH. AND YOU CANNOT COUNTER PROPERLY IF YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW TOPUNCH.” HE WENT ON TO EXPLAIN HOW “FELLOWS” WHO HAVE NO CONFIDENCE IN THEIRPUNCHING ABILITIES DEVELOP “DEFENCE COMPLEXES,” RESULTING IN UNNECESSARYFOOTWORK, BACK PEDALING, PULLED PUNCHES, AND AN OVERALL BAD TIME OF IT IN THERING.29AND ALL THAT RUNNING AROUND IS TIRING! IT’S MUCH MORE EFFICIENT TO STAND YOURGROUND AND STOP A RUSHER IN HIS TRACKS WITH A WELL-TIMED AND WELL-PLACEDSTRAIGHT LEAD. IT’S ALSO A LOT MORE FUN.AS I MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS CHAPTER, THAT STRAIGHT PUNCH WILL ALWAYSBEAT AN ARCED PUNCH INITIATED AT THE SAME TIME—AND SOMETIMES EVEN WHEN THE HOOKOR SWING IS FIRED FIRST. THERE’S AN EXCELLENT ILLUSTRATION OF THIS IN HAISLET’SBOXING, WHERE IT IS ALSO DESCRIBED AS A WAY TO DEFEND AGAINST JABS. IT MAKESSUCH PERFECT SENSE TO USE THE STRAIGHT AS A MEANS OF DEFENSE, HAISLET NOTED THATBOXERS OFTEN USE IT AS SUCH UNCONSCIOUSLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY’VEBE TRAINED TO DO SO.30PART OF WHAT MAKES THE STRAIGHT LEAD SUCH A GREAT DEFENSIVE MOVE IS THE WAY INWHICH IT IS THROWN FROM THE STANCE COMPLETELY PROTECTS YOUR CENTERLINE. IN FACT,UNLIKE THE REAR CROSS OR A CONVENTIONAL BOXING JAB, YOUR TARGET AREA ACTUALLYBECOMES NARROWER AS YOU THROW THE PUNCH. THIS DEFENSIVE PROPERTY OF THE STRAIGHTHAS ITS ROOTS IN FENCING.A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF FENCING IS TO “KEEP THE LINE.” BY THROWING A STRAIGHTLEAD AS A FENCER WOULD, YOU CREATE A DIRECT LINE FROM YOUR SHOULDER TO THE ARM.IT IS THEN VERY DIFFICULT FOR YOUR OPPONENT TO GET AT YOU. YOUR CENTERLINEBECOMES UNREACHABLE AS YOU EXTEND YOUR ARM AND TURN YOUR HIP. YOU BECOME THATMUCH HARDER TO HIT AT THE SAME TIME YOU ARE HITTING. TALK ABOUT A WIN-WINSITUATION. ACCORDING TO DRISCOLL, THE ONLY WAY FOR YOUR OPPONENT TO BREAKTHROUGH YOUR STRAIGHT LEAD DEFENSE IS FOR YOU TO STOP THROWING IT.31IN THIS CHAPTER, WE’VE DIPPED A LITTLE INTO FIGHTING SCIENCE TO EXPLAIN THE MAINREASONS FOR USING THE STRAIGHT PUNCH: SPEED, ACCURACY, FREQUENCY OF HITS,BALANCE, AND SAFETY. IN THE NEXT CHAPTER, I’LL TALK A BIT MORE ABOUT APPLICATIONAND HOW THE STRAIGHT LEAD CAN BE USED. IN THE MEANTIME, JUST REMEMBER THAT BRUCEWROTE, “INTO EVERY JEET KUNE DO OFFENSE, DEFENSE IS ALSO WELDED IN TO FORM WHATI TERM ‘DEFENSIVE OFFENSE.’”32[../Images/2.jpg]“ P O W E R I N T H E P U N C H ”BEFORE FINISHING THIS CHAPTER ON THE ADVANTAGES OF THE STRAIGHT LEAD, I WANT TOBRIEFLY RETURN TO THE SUBJECT OF BIOMECHANICS. WE’VE ALREADY COVERED THEHOW-TO’S AND SCIENTIFIC WHYS RELATED TO THE STRAIGHT LEAD—THE MECHANICS, LAWSGOVERNING PHYSICAL MOTION, AND SO ON. I’D JUST LIKE TO ADD ONE MORE PIECE OFEVIDENCE IN FAVOR OF THE STRAIGHT LEAD.IN 1974, BLACK BELT MAGAZINE REPRINTED HAYWARD NISHIOKA’S STUDY COMPARING THEJEET KUNE DO STRAIGHT LEAD TO THE KARATE PUNCH. ELECTRODES WERE ATTACHED TO THEJOINTS AND THE MUSCLES AROUND THOSE JOINTS. AT THE SHOULDER JOINT, THEPECTORALIS MAJOR, THE ANTERIOR DELTOID, AND LATISSIMUS DORSI WERE MEASURED. ATTHE SHOULDER GIRDLE, THE SERRATUS ANTERIOR, TRAPEZIUS II, AND TRAPEZIUS III WEREMEASURED. AND AT THE ELBOW JOINT, THE BICEPS BRACHII, BICEPS BRACHIALIS, ANDTRICEPS WERE MEASURED. MUSCLE ACTIVITY WAS MEASURED USING AN ELECTROMYOGRAM.THE JEET KUNE DO LEAD REGISTERED HIGHER ACTIVITY FOR ALL THREE MUSCLES AT THESHOULDER JOINT. THE KARATE PUNCH MEASURED HIGHER ON ALL THREE MUSCLES AT THESHOULDER GIRDLE. THE MOST INTERESTING FINDING, THOUGH, WAS AT THE ELBOW JOINT.REMEMBER THE DISCUSSION OF AGONISTS AND ANTAGONISTS AND HOW RELAXATION MINIMIZESTHEIR SIMULTANEOUS ACTIVATION, RESULTING IN A FASTER, MORE EFFICIENT, LESSFATIGUING TECHNIQUE. NISHIOKA FOUND THAT THE KARATE PUNCH ACTIVATED BOTHAGONISTS AND ANTAGONISTS, “NEUTRALIZING THE IMPACT UPON THE PUNCHING GLOVE.” THEANTAGONISTS—LATS, TRAPS, AND BICEPS—CONTRACTED ECCENTRICALLY “LONG BEFOREIMPACT.” ECCENTRIC CONTRACTION IS SOMETIMES THOUGHT OF AS A “BRAKING”CONTRACTION, AND IN THIS CASE, IT CLEARLY DECREASED THE ACCELERATION ANDEFFECTIVENESS OF THE KARATE STRIKE.ON THE OTHER HAND, ANTAGONIST ACTIVITY REGISTERED MUCH LOWER WITH THE JKDSTRAIGHT LEAD, RESULTING IN A FASTER, AND, CONSEQUENTLY, MORE FORCEFUL PUNCH(REMEMBER FORCE EQUALS MASS TIMES ACCELERATION). ALTHOUGH AGONISTS ANDANTAGONISTS WERE ACTIVATED, SIMULTANEOUS ACTIVATION ONLY OCCURRED AT THE POINTOF IMPACT. THIS MAKES SENSE, CONSIDERING THE REASONING BEHIND SNAPPY PUNCHES.JUST AFTER IMPACT IS WHEN WE REVERSE DIRECTIONS AND RETRACT THE HAND, AND THISREQUIRES SOME ECCENTRIC CONTRACTION.33, 34I’VE CONCLUDED THIS CHAPTER WITH NISHIOKA’S STUDY TO REITERATE THAT PROPERTECHNIQUE, FORM, AND RELAXATION RESULT IN THE KIND OF SPEED AND FORCE THAT MAKEALL THE ADVANTAGES OF THE STRAIGHT LEAD POSSIBLE.[../Images/2.jpg]N O T E S1 EDWIN L.

IT’S IMPORTANT TOREMEMBER, THOUGH, THAT WHEN BRUCE LEE SPOKE OF MARTIAL ART AND JEET KUNE DO, HEWAS REFERRING TO THE ORIGINAL DEFINITION OF “MARTIAL.” HE WAS TALKING ABOUTFIGHTING.KEEP THIS IN MIND AS WE DISCUSS HOW TO APPLY THE STRAIGHT LEAD IN COMBATIVESITUATIONS. WE ARE NOT DEALING WITH POINT OR TOUCH SCORING. NOR ARE WEDISCUSSING REHEARSED FORMS AND DRILLS. THERE’S NOTHING WRONG WITH STUDYING INTHIS WAY. THE ATHLETICISM NEEDED FOR KATAS, WUSHU COMPETITION, AND FILMCHOREOGRAPHY IS MIND-BOGGLING. THESE ARTS REQUIRE ELITE-ATHLETE SKILL, ANDANYTHING THAT REQUIRES THAT KIND OF TIME, PATIENCE, AND DISCIPLINE IS AWORTHWHILE ENDEAVOR. THEY’RE JUST NOT CLOSE ENOUGH TO THEIR MARTIAL ANCESTORS TOFULLY APPRECIATE THE COMBATIVE APPLICATION OF THE STRAIGHT LEAD.IN CONTRAST TO THOSE OTHER ARTS, JEET KUNE DO IS NOT FLASHY, AND THERE ARE VERYFEW TECHNIQUES—A FEW PUNCHES AND A FEW KICKS. REMEMBER THE ROOTS. EVERYTHING ISBASED ON EFFICIENCY AND ECONOMY, AND THE STRAIGHT LEAD IS THE EPITOME OFEFFICIENCY. BLINK AND YOU MIGHT MISS IT. THAT’S THE POINT. IN THE HEAT OFBATTLE, THERE’S NO TIME FOR COMPLICATED TECHNIQUES OR WASTED MOTION.[../Images/145a.jpg]FIGURE 91: SPARRING IS THE ONLY WAY TO TRULY APPRECIATE THE STRAIGHT LEAD. HERE,I’VE USED IT TO SET UP FOR THE REAR CROSS.MUCH OF WHAT BRUCE LEE DID ON FILM WAS EITHER AN EXAGGERATED VERSION OF JEETKUNE DO OR, AS IN THE CASE OF WEAPONS, WAS INCLUDED FOR THE BENEFIT OF MAKINGSOMETHING LOOK INTERESTING FOR THE CAMERA. THE TECHNIQUES HE WROTE ABOUT ANDUSED FOR SPARRING AT HOME, HOWEVER, WERE MUCH MORE STREAMLINED THAN HISMOVEMENTS FOR FILM.1THIS BRINGS US TO THE SUBJECT OF SPARRING, WHICH IS ANOTHER TERM THATENCOMPASSES A BROAD RANGE OF DEFINITIONS—FROM ANYTHING-GOES FIGHTING TOCHOREOGRAPHED ROUTINES. IN JKD TERMS, HOWEVER, SPARRING MEANS GETTING CLOSER TOTHE REAL THING. THIS MEANS DONNING TRAINING GLOVES AND HEADGEAR. THERESTRICTIONS AND INTENSITY LEVEL MAY VARY. SOMETIMES YOU MAY TRAIN AT LESS THANYOUR MAXIMUM INTENSITY AS YOU LEARN TO INCORPORATE SPECIFIC TECHNIQUES. AT OTHERTIMES, YOU’LL GET CLOSER TO AN ALL-OUT BRAWL.IN ANY CASE, THE POINT OF SPARRING IS TO TEACH YOU HOW TO APPLY TECHNIQUES INMORE REALISTIC SITUATIONS. HITTING FOCUS PADS IS IMPORTANT, BUT FOCUS PADS DON’THIT BACK. YOU NEED TO LEARN HOW TO HIT A MOVING TARGET AND LAND ACCURATELY.YOU’LL ALSO NEED TO LEARN HOW TO TAKE A HIT AND COUNTER. AS BRUCE HIMSELFPOINTED OUT, THE ONLY WAY TO LEARN HOW TO FIGHT IS TO FIGHT:> THE BEST WAY TO LEARN HOW TO SWIM IS TO ACTUALLY GET INTO THE WATER AND SWIM;> THE BEST WAY TO LEARN JEET KUNE DO IS TO SPAR. ONLY IN FREE SPARRING CAN A> PRACTITIONER BEGIN TO LEARN BROKEN RHYTHM AND THE EXACT TIMING AND CORRECT> JUDGMENT OF DISTANCE.2YOU’LL SEE EMPHASIS ON THESE ELEMENTS OF TIME AND DISTANCE OVER AND OVERTHROUGHOUT FENCING AND BOXING LITERATURE. MASTERY OF THESE VARIABLES IS THEDIFFERENCE BETWEEN DRY-LAND SWIMMING AND DIVING INTO THE WATER.[../Images/2.jpg]“ T H E S T R A I G H T P U N C H I S T H E C O R E O F J E E T K U NE D O ”WE BEGAN THIS BOOK WITH THE STATEMENT THAT THE STRAIGHT LEAD IS THE CORE OF JKD,AND FROM THE LAST CHAPTER ON THE ADVANTAGES OF STRAIGHT PUNCHING IT’S EASY TOSEE WHY. IN THIS CHAPTER, I’LL TALK ABOUT HOW TO STRATEGICALLY USE THE LEADHAND. THE EMPHASIS BRUCE PLACED ON THE LEAD HAND COMES FROM BOXING, WHERE IT IS“THE CENTRAL THEME.”3 ALL OTHER TECHNIQUES ARE SET UP BY OR FOLLOW THE STRAIGHTLEAD, AND THE STANCE THAT I SPENT SO MUCH TIME EXPLAINING HAS BEEN SET UPSPECIFICALLY FOR DELIVERY OF THE STRAIGHT LEAD.[../Images/2.jpg]“ T H E E S S E N C E O F F I G H T I N G I S T H E A R T O F M O V I NG A T T H E R I G H T T I M E ”4S T R A T E G I C V A R I A B L E STHE WAY FIGHTERS PLAY WITH TIME IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE WAY MUSICIANS INTERPRETTIME. YOU CAN PLAY ON THE BEAT, BEHIND THE BEAT, OR SYNCOPATE. STACCATO ORLEGATO. YOU CAN CHOOSE TO PLAY OR LET THE RHYTHM SECTION PASS YOU BY. THE TEMPOMAY VARY FROM ADAGIO (SLOW) TO ALLEGRO (QUICK). TO THE TIME, YOU CAN THEN ADDDYNAMIC VARIATIONS—PIANISSIMO (SOFT), MEZZO FORTE (MODERATELY LOUD), ORFORTISSIMO (VERY LOUD).FIGHTING HAS ANALOGOUS VARIABLES. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NOTES PLAYED STACCATO(RAPID AND CLIPPED) AND LEGATO (SMOOTH AND SLURRED) IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ASNAPPY PUNCH THAT MINIMALLY PENETRATES THE TARGET, BARELY TOUCHING IT, AND ASLOWER POWER PUNCH THAT PENETRATES THE TARGET WITH GREATER DEPTH. YOU CAN THROWOUT A PUNCH AND THEN PAUSE—CHOOSING NOT TO PLAY AND LETTING THE RHYTHM SECTIONPASS BENEATH YOU—AND THEN THROW OUT ANOTHER PUNCH. TEMPO IS SOMETHING THAT ISREFERRED TO AS CADENCE IN THE MARTIAL ARTS, PARTICULARLY IN FENCING. ANDDYNAMICS MAY BE THOUGHT OF AS VARIATIONS IN INTENSITY INSTEAD OF VOLUME. YOUMIGHT THINK OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PIANISSIMO AND FORTISSIMO AS THEDIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FEELER JAB AND A STIFF ONE.AND THEN, OF COURSE, YOU CAN MIX AND MATCH THESE VARIABLES. YOU CAN PLAY ORPUNCH STACCATO AND FORTE. OR ADAGIO AND PIANISSIMO. LEGATO AND FORTISSIMO. THEPOINT IS YOU CAN THROW A SINGLE PUNCH IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS, AND BY DOINGSO, YOU KEEP YOUR OPPONENT GUESSING.P U N C H I N G D E P T HWE JUST TOUCHED ON THE SUBJECT OF VARYING THE DEPTH TO YOUR PUNCHES. BRUCEREFERRED TO THIS AS “SHORT” VERSUS “LONG” PUNCHES.5 SHORT PUNCHES ARE THOSE THATSHOOT OUT QUICKLY BUT BARELY TOUCH OR MINIMALLY PENETRATE THE TARGET. LONGPUNCHES ARE THOSE SLOWER BUT MORE FORCEFUL ONES THAT PUNCH FURTHER THROUGH THETARGET. HAVING CONTROL OVER THE DEPTH OF YOUR PUNCHES, AGAIN, KEEPS YOUROPPONENT GUESSING AND ENABLES YOU TO DISRUPT HIS RHYTHM. IF YOU THROW A SERIESOF SHORT PUNCHES AND THROW IN A LONG ONE, YOUR OPPONENT WON’T EXPECT IT. YOU CANALSO DO THE OPPOSITE: THROW A SERIES OF LONG PUNCHES AND THEN SET HIMOFF-BALANCE AND UPSET HIS RHYTHM WITH A SHORT ONE.6IT’S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT NOT EVERY PUNCH YOU THROW SHOULD BE WITH THE SAMEFORCE OR DEPTH. MIXING IT UP ADDS MORE TOOLS TO YOUR ARSENAL. AND THROWING ASHORT PUNCH IS MUCH FASTER THAN THROWING A LONG ONE. IF IT’S THE DIFFERENCEBETWEEN STINGING YOUR OPPONENT WITH A FAST, SHORT STRAIGHT LEAD OR MISSINGALTOGETHER WITH A SLOW HAYMAKER, I’LL TAKE THAT STINGING JAB.YOU CAN PRACTICE DEPTH CONTROL WITH THE FOCUS MITTS OR THE HEAVY BAG. PRACTICEHITTING WITH VARYING DEGREES OF DEPTH. TRY HITTING AS FORCEFULLY AS YOU CAN,GOING ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE TARGET. THEN TRY BARELY TOUCHING THE TARGET. ORPULL BACK WITHOUT HITTING THE TARGET AT ALL. THAT’S CONTROL.ONE THING TO WATCH FOR HERE IS THAT MANY PEOPLE MISTAKE DEPTH AND FORCE FORSPEED. WHEN ASKED TO BARELY TOUCH THE TARGET, THEY THINK THEY ARE HITTING“LIGHTER” AND SO THEY SLOW DOWN, TOO. DON’T DO THAT! IF YOU INTEND TO DO SOMEKIND OF DAMAGE—I’M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE FEELER JAB HERE—YOU WANT TO HIT WITHTHE SAME SPEED WITH EVERY PUNCH. REMEMBER, FORCE EQUALS MASS TIMES ACCELERATION,SO DO NOT SLOW DOWN.ANOTHER PURPOSE OF VARYING THE DEPTH OF YOUR PUNCHES IS THAT IT ALLOWS YOU TOBRIDGE THE GAP TO YOUR OPPONENT. BY THROWING A SERIES OF SHORT STRAIGHT LEADS,YOU CAN KEEP YOUR OPPONENT ON THE DEFENSIVE AS YOU GET CLOSER TO HIM. EVEN IFYOU FAIL TO REACH HIM, YOU ARE NOW CLOSE ENOUGH TO FOLLOW UP WITH A LONG LEAD OROTHER WEAPONS.7[../Images/2.jpg]T I M I N GB R O K E N R H Y T H MTHE INTRODUCTION OF THE SHORT AND LONG PUNCHES SEGUES NICELY INTO THE SUBJECTSOF TIMING AND BROKEN RHYTHM. AGAIN, THIS IS SOMETHING TAKEN FROM FENCINGSTRATEGY. THE IDEA IS THAT YOU ESTABLISH A RHYTHM WITH THE LEAD HAND BY THROWINGOUT A SERIES OF PUNCHES WITH THE SAME DEPTH AND SPEED, MAYBE AT THE SAME TARGET,FOR IT IS HUMAN NATURE TO BE SET IN A TRANCE BY RHYTHM.8BRUCE ADDRESSED THIS TRANCELIKE STATE AND HOW IT RELATES TO FIGHTING:> A SERIES OF JUDICIOUSLY SLOWED DOWN FEINTS TO THE LEG AND SLOW GAINING AND> BREAKING GROUND MAY BE USED (TO ‘PUT THE OPPONENT TO SLEEP’). A FINAL SIMPLE> MOVEMENT WHICH SUDDENLY ERUPTS AT HIGHEST SPEED WILL OFTEN TAKE HIM UNAWARES.9YOU’LL FIND THE PRINCIPLE OF BROKEN RHYTHM IN JKD HAS ITS ROOTS IN FENCING ANDTHE WRITINGS OF JULIO MARTINEZ CASTELLO:> TIMING CONSISTS OF SELECTING THE OPPORTUNE MOMENT FOR MAKING AN ATTACK OR A> PARRY. THIS OPPORTUNE MOMENT USUALLY HAS TO BE CREATED RATHER THAN DISCOVERED.> . . THE MOVEMENTS OF THE ATTACKING AND DEFENDING BLADES WORK ALMOST IN RHYTHM> WITH EACH OTHER, AND ALTHOUGH THERE IS A SLIGHT ADVANTAGE IN THE INITIATIVE OF> THE ATTACK, IT MUST ALSO BE BACKED BY SUPERIOR SPEED IN ORDER TO LAND> SUCCESSFULLY. HOWEVER, WHEN THIS RHYTHM IS BROKEN, SPEED IS NO LONGER THE> PRIMARY ELEMENT IN THE SUCCESS OF THE ATTACK OR COUNTER ATTACK OF THE MAN WHO> HAS BROKEN THE RHYTHM. IF THE RHYTHM HAS BEEN WELL ESTABLISHED, THERE IS A> TENDENCY TO CONTINUE IN THE SEQUENCE OF THE MOVEMENT. IN OTHER WORDS, EACH MAN> IS MOTOR-SET TO CONTINUE THE SEQUENCE OF THE MOVEMENTS. THE MAN WHO CAN BEAT> THIS RHYTHM BY A SLIGHT HESITATION OR AN UNEXPECTED MOVEMENT CAN NOW SCORE AN> ATTACK OR COUNTER ATTACK WITH ONLY MODERATE SPEED; FOR HIS OPPONENT IS> MOTOR-SET TO CONTINUE WITH THE PREVIOUS RHYTHM, AND BEFORE HE CAN ADJUST> HIMSELF TO THE CHANGE, HE HAS BEEN HIT.10CASTELLO NOTED THAT BY PROPERLY TIMING YOUR OPPONENT WITH BROKEN RHYTHM, YOU DONOT HAVE TO BE PARTICULARLY FAST TO BE EFFECTIVE. SIMILARLY, DRISCOLL SAID THATA PROPERLY TIMED STRAIGHT LEAD MAY DROP AN OPPONENT WITH SEEMINGLY LITTLEEFFORT, PARTICULARLY IF HE’S ADVANCING TOWARD YOU. IN THIS CASE, HE IS BEING HITNOT ONLY WITH YOUR FORCE, BUT THE FORCE OF HIS OWN ADVANCE AS WELL.11 IMPECCABLETIMING IS THE MARK OF AN EDUCATED, SMART FIGHTER, AND TO A CERTAIN EXTENT,TIMING CAN COMPENSATE FOR A LACK IN SPEED AND SIZE.12TRANCELIKE STATE, “PUT TO SLEEP,” “MOTOR-SET.” YOU WANT TO LULL YOUR OPPONENTINTO A STATE OF COMFORT AND THEN SUDDENLY STRIKE. ALSO KNOW THAT YOU CAN DO THISEITHER BY SLOWLY SETTING A RHYTHM OF ADVANCING AND THEN FOLLOWING WITH A QUICKADVANCE. OR YOU CAN SET UP A RHYTHM OF RETREAT AND THEN SUDDENLY STEP FORWARD TOINTERCEPT HIS ADVANCE OR ATTACK. WHICH BRINGS US TO THE SUBJECT OF THE STOP-HIT.T H E S T O P - H I TTHERE ARE REALLY ONLY TWO WAYS TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN YOU AND YOUROPPONENT—EITHER YOU GO TO HIM, OR HE COMES TO YOU. IN THE CASE OF THE STOP-HIT,YOUR OPPONENT IS COMING TO YOU. YOUR OPPONENT PROVIDES THE DISTANCE. WE’VEALREADY TOUCHED ON THE IDEA OF “DEFENSIVE OFFENSE.”13 THE STOP-HIT IS THEHALLMARK OF DEFENSIVE OFFENSE AND IS OFTEN USED AS A WAY TO STOP AN ATTACK DEADIN ITS TRACKS. BUT IT CAN ALSO BE SET UP BY MOTOR-SETTING YOUR OPPONENT AS JUSTDISCUSSED.LIKE MANY KEY ELEMENTS OF JKD, THE STOP-HIT ALSO HAS ITS ROOTS IN FENCING. UPONINTRODUCING THE STOP-HIT, NADI WROTE, “HERE THEN YOU HAVE THE FIRST GLIMPSE OFONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL FENCING DOGMAS, TO WIT, THAT THE BEST MOMENT OF ATTACKFROM IMMOBILITY IS WHEN YOUR OPPONENT ADVANCES TOWARD YOU. ”14DRISCOLL WAS QUICK TO DRAW THE PARALLELS BETWEEN THE FENCING STOP-HIT AND BOXINGSTRATEGY.15 LIKE NADI, DRISCOLL KNEW THAT AN OPPONENT IS MOST VULNERABLE WHENATTACKING AND THAT AGGRESSIVE RUSHERS ARE EASILY DEALT WITH BY A WELL-TIMED,STRAIGHT LEAD STOP-HIT, WHAT HE REFERRED TO AS “THE STOP POLICY”:> PERHAPS THE MOST EFFECTIVE DEFENSIVE STRAIGHT LEFT-HANDED “STOP” IS THAT WHICH> IS, OR SHOULD BE EMPLOYED, AGAINST THE DETERMINED RUSHES OR PERSISTENTLY> ATTACKING OPPONENT. FOR THESE MEN ARE, AFTER ALL, THE EASIEST MEN IN THE WORLD> TO BEAT AT THE BOXING GAME.16ONCE SOMEONE HAS COMMITTED TO AN ATTACK, THERE’S NO TURNING BACK.17 REVERSINGDIRECTIONS DURING AN ATTACK IS NOT RECOMMENDED. THIS PUTS YOUR OPPONENT IN ANEVEN MORE VULNERABLE SPOT. OF COURSE, WITH CORRECT TIMING, YOU’RE GOING TO GETHIM ANYWAY.THREE WAYS TO TIMEIT’S WORTH NOTING THERE ARE REALLY THREE POINTS WHERE YOU CAN TIME YOUROPPONENT. FIRST IS BEFORE HE OR SHE ATTACKS. BRUCE REFERRED TO THIS AS ATTACK ONPREPARATION. THIS IS MORE OF A MENTAL CUE THAN A PHYSICAL ONE, FOR YOUR OPPONENTHAS NOT YET MADE A MOVEMENT TOWARD YOU. YOU MAY CATCH HIM, THOUGH, MENTALLYPREPARING FOR ATTACK, AND AT THIS MOMENT, HIS DEFENSES ARE DOWN.18THE SECOND PLACE FOR YOU TO ATTACK IS DURING YOUR OPPONENT’S ATTACK. THIS WOULDBE THE STOP-HIT. WITH A FAST AND STRAIGHT LEAD PUNCH, YOU MAY BEAT YOUROPPONENT’S ATTACK EVEN IF YOU START YOURS AFTER YOUR OPPONENT’S IS INITIATED.FINALLY, YOU MAY ATTACK AFTER YOUR OPPONENT’S COMPLETED HIS OFFENSIVE AS HE’SRETRACTING HIS HAND. HE IS STILL IN NO POSITION TO RELAUNCH AN ATTACK, AND IFHE’S SLOW TO RECOVER TO THE ON-GUARD POSITION, YOU HAVE EVEN MORE TIME TO GET TOHIM.S T E P - I N, S T E P - O U TANOTHER WAY TO CATCH YOUR OPPONENT IN A STOP-HIT IS BY THE STEP-IN-STEP-OUTFEINT.19 WE’VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT SETTING UP RHYTHMS BY ADVANCING SLOWLY ANDTHEN QUICKLY ADVANCING OR BY RETREATING AND THEN SUDDENLY ADVANCING. THESTEP-IN-STEP-OUT IS A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH. SET UP A PATTERN OF STEPPING TOWARDHIM AND THEN STEPPING AWAY. ONCE YOU’VE LULLED HIM INTO A PATTERN, BREAK IT BYSTEPPING IN AND INSTEAD OF STEPPING OUT, THIS TIME QUICKLY STEP IN AGAIN ANDATTACK.T H E H A L F - B E A TBROKEN RHYTHM, STOP-HITS, TIME THRUSTS, THE STEP-IN-STEP-OUT FEINT, AND OTHERATTACKS AND COUNTERATTACKS ARE ALL MADE POSSIBLE BY WHAT TED WONG CALLSHALF-BEAT FOOTWORK. ONCE AGAIN, THIS HAS ITS ORIGINS IN FENCING STRATEGY. NADIDESCRIBED THE HALF-BEAT AND HOW IT LINKS OFFENSE AND DEFENSE:> ACTUALLY, THESE “PARADOXES” ARE THE BASIS UPON WHICH THE ENTIRE ART AND> SCIENCE OF ARMS IS BUILT. IN COMBAT, WHEN THE FENCER FORSAKES THE ORTHODOX> ATTACK AND PARRY-RIPOSTE FOR THE COUNTERATTACK, HE LITERALLY PUTS THE> HALF-NOTE INTO THE MUSIC OF FENCING, SUPERIMPOSING IT UPON, OR OBLITERATING> TEMPORARILY, THE WHOLE-NOTE CONCEPT AND RHYTHM. IN FACT, THE STRONGER THE> FENCER THE GREATER THE IMPORTANCE OF, AND THE RESULTS OBTAINED BY, THIS> HALF-NOTE. THIS IS SO TRUE THAT THE CHAMPION SUCCEEDS IN MIXING HIS OFFENSIVE> AND DEFENSIVE OPERATIONS TO SUCH A LARGE DEGREE—PASSING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER> SO RAPIDLY—THAT EVEN FOR THE MOST COMPETENT JUDGE IT IS SOMETIMES IMPOSSIBLE> TO ANALYZE HIS INTENTIONS AND ACTIONS CORRECTLY.20WE ALREADY ADDRESSED THE HALF-BEAT IN THE FOOTWORK CHAPTER. AGAIN, A WHOLE NOTECONSISTS OF BOTH THE LANDING OF YOUR FRONT AND REAR FOOT. THAT’S ONE FULL BEAT.MANY MARTIAL ARTS ONLY HAVE WHOLE-BEAT FOOTWORK AND MAY APPEAR VERY RIGID.FIGHTERS OF SUCH ARTS CAN ONLY MAKE ANOTHER MOVE ONCE AN ENTIRE BEAT HAS BEENCOMPLETED.BUT BY BEING ABLE TO REVERSE DIRECTION AND CHANGE FROM DEFENSE TO OFFENSE ON THEHALF-BEAT, FENCERS HAVE MANY MORE VARIABLES TO PLAY WITH. THERE ARE MANY MOREOPPORTUNITIES TO TRICK AN OPPONENT AND SET HIM UP BY DISRUPTING HIS RHYTHM. HEWILL ALWAYS BE GUESSING.IF YOU ARE ABLE TO MOVE ON THE HALF-BEAT IN ANY DIRECTION, YOU BECOMEUNPREDICTABLE AND MUCH MORE MOBILE, EXPONENTIALLY CREATING STRIKINGOPPORTUNITIES. YOU CAN ONLY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE HALF-BEAT AND ITS BENEFITS,THOUGH, THROUGH SOUND, PRECISE FOOTWORK.[../Images/2.jpg]D I S T A N C EAS YOU’LL RECALL FROM THE FOOTWORK CHAPTER, MAINTAINING PROPER DISTANCE—OR THEFIGHTING MEASURE—IS CRUCIAL TO LANDING PUNCHES. OBVIOUSLY, YOU DON’T WANT TO BETOO FAR AWAY FROM YOUR OPPONENT, BECAUSE YOU’LL NEVER REACH HIM. YOU ALSO DON’TWANT TO BE TOO CLOSE, OR YOU’LL JAM YOURSELF AND LOSE LEVERAGE. REMEMBER WEALWAYS WANT TO HAVE ABOUT 3 OR 4 INCHES TO PUNCH THROUGH THE TARGET—NO MORE, NOLESS.WHEN IN AN ACTUAL COMBATIVE SITUATION, THOUGH, WE FIND IT CAN BE PRETTYDIFFICULT HITTING A MOVING TARGET, ESPECIALLY ONE THAT DOESN’T PRESENT MANYOPPORTUNITIES FOR COUNTERING WITH STOP-HITS. THIS IS WHERE THE STRAIGHT LEADCOMES IN. AS MENTIONED BEFORE, THROWING A COMBINATION OF STRAIGHT PUNCHES KEEPSYOUR OPPONENT ON THE DEFENSE, ALLOWING YOU TO GET WITHIN STRIKING RANGE.AGAIN, YOU CAN USE ALL THOSE COMBINATIONS OF SHORT AND LONG PUNCHES. DOUBLEJABS. TRIPLE JABS. YOU CAN ALSO VARY THE TARGETS OF THOSE STRAIGHT PUNCHES.MAYBE SHOOT LOW AND THEN HIGH. OR DOUBLE JAB HIGH AND DROP SHIFT LOW. I’LL GOOVER VARIATIONS OF THE STRAIGHT LEAD LATER, BUT AN EXAMPLE OF USING STRAIGHTLEAD VARIATIONS IS TO THROW A BACKFIST AND STRAIGHT AND THEN FINISH UP WITH ACORKSCREW HOOK. THE POINT IS THAT YOU CAN BE VERY CREATIVE WITH JUST THE LEADHAND, AND THIS ALLOWS YOU TO WORK YOUR WAY IN TOWARD YOUR OPPONENT. THIS IS HOWYOU BRIDGE THE GAP.ALSO KNOW THAT LEAD HAND COMBOS ARE MUCH QUICKER THAN COMBOS USING THE REARHAND. THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE ADVANCED POSITION OF THE FRONT HAND AND THE FACTTHAT THROWING A REAR HAND REQUIRES GREATER DEVIATION FROM THE STANCE. AND MOREDEVIATION FROM THE STANCE MEANS SLOWER RECOVERY TIME AND AN OVERALL SLOWERCOMBINATION. SEE FIGURE 92.[../Images/2.jpg]F I V E W A Y S O F A T T A C KWE’VE GOT SOME NEW TOYS IN OUR STRAIGHT LEAD TOOL BAG NOW. BROKEN RHYTHM, SHORTPUNCHES, LONG PUNCHES, HALF-BEATS, STEP-IN-STEP-OUT FEINTS, STOP-HITS, TIMING,DISTANCE. IF YOU’RE FAMILIAR WITH BRUCE LEE’S WRITINGS, THEN YOU ALREADY KNOWTHERE ARE FIVE WAYS OF ATTACK. I’M JUST GOING TO BRIEFLY TOUCH ON EACH ONE TOEXPLAIN WHERE SOME OF OUR NEW TOOLS FIT IN. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE FIVEWAYS OF ATTACK, BE SURE TO CONSULT THE TAO OF JEET KUNE DO.[../Images/152a.jpg]FIGURE 92: PLAYING WITH TIME AND DISTANCE CREATES STRIKING OPPORTUNITIES.S I M P L E A N G L E A T T A C K (S A A)THE SIMPLE ANGLE ATTACK IS A ONE-MOTION ATTACK. IN MOST CASES, IT’S THE STRAIGHTLEAD, ALTHOUGH KICKS AND OTHER PUNCHES MAY BE USED FOR SAA AS WELL. THIS IS AONE-SHOT DEAL, AND SO IT IS THE MOST DIFFICULT METHOD OF ATTACK, REQUIRINGPRECISE DISTANCE, TIMING, AND LIGHTNING SPEED. YOU MUST BE IN OPTIMAL POSITIONTO EXECUTE A SIMPLE ANGLE ATTACK, AND THIS IS ALWAYS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGHFOOTWORK. 21, 22A T T A C K B Y C O M B I N A T I O N (A B C)ATTACK BY COMBINATION IS EXACTLY AS IT’S NAMED. A COMBINATION OF PUNCHES ARETHROWN— OFTEN TO MORE THAN ONE LINE—IN AN ATTEMPT TO CREATE AN OPENING FOR AFINISHING BLOW.23 MOST OF THE TIME, SUCH COMBINATIONS LEAD WITH THE STRAIGHTPUNCH (SEE FIGURES 93 THROUGH 96). HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES:[../Images/a.jpg] STRAIGHT RIGHT/LEFT CROSS/RIGHT HOOK[../Images/a.jpg] STRAIGHT RIGHT/STRAIGHT RIGHT/CORKSCREW HOOK[../Images/a.jpg] STRAIGHT RIGHT/LEFT UPPERCUT/RIGHT HOOK[../Images/a.jpg] STRAIGHT RIGHT DROP SHIFT/RIGHT HOOK TO THE HEAD[../Images/a.jpg] STRAIGHT RIGHT/RIGHT HOOK LOW/RIGHT HOOK HIGHYOU GET THE IDEA. YOU CAN THEN START ADDING THE ELEMENTS OF TIME AND BROKENRHYTHM TO THIS. VARY THE DEPTH OF YOUR PUNCHES. ADD STUTTER STEPS AND PAUSESBETWEEN SHOTS. EVEN WITH ONLY A FEW PUNCHES, THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS.TO EXPERIMENT WITH TIME, TRY ONLY THROWING TRIPLE STRAIGHT LEADS AND VARY YOURCOMBINATIONS BY TIME AND DEPTH ONLY:[../Images/a.jpg] SHORT/SHORT/LONG[../Images/a.jpg] SHORT/LONG/SHORT[../Images/a.jpg] SHORT/SHORT/SHORT[../Images/a.jpg] LONG/SHORT/SHORT[../Images/a.jpg] LONG/LONG/SHORT[../Images/a.jpg] LONG/LONG/LONG[../Images/a.jpg] LONG/SHORT/LONG[../Images/a.jpg] SHORT/SHORT/PAUSE/LONG[../Images/a.jpg] LONG/PAUSE/SHORT/SHORT[../Images/a.jpg] SHORT/PAUSE/LONG/LONGAGAIN, THE COMBINATIONS ARE ENDLESS. ALWAYS KEEP IN MIND THAT YOU DO NOT NEED ALOT OF TECHNIQUES TO KEEP YOUR OPPONENT GUESSING. IT’S NOT HOW MANY TECHNIQUESYOU HAVE IN YOUR TOOL BAG, IT’S WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH THOSE TOOLS. AGAIN, KNOWINGTHE INS AND OUTS OF A FEW TECHNIQUES IS PREFERABLE TO ONLY SUPERFICIALLY KNOWINGAN ENTIRE CATALOG OF TECHNIQUE.[../Images/154a.jpg]FIGURE 93: THE STRAIGHT LEAD IS THE BEST WAY TO SET UP COMBINATIONS.[../Images/154b.jpg]FIGURE 94: FOLLOW THE STRAIGHT WITH A REAR CROSS.[../Images/155a.jpg]FIGURE 95: AND THEN A HOOK KICK...[../Images/155b.jpg]FIGURE 96:. . . OR A SIDE KICK.P R O G R E S S I V E I N D I R E C T A T T A C K (P I A)THE PROGRESSIVE INDIRECT ATTACK IS SOMETIMES THOUGHT OF AS “ATTACK BY FRAUD,”BECAUSE IT IS BEGINS WITH A FEINT OR FAKE OR UNCOMMITTED STRIKE, MAKING THIS ANINDIRECT ATTACK. THE PURPOSE OF THE PIA IS TO BRIDGE THE GAP, TO COVER DISTANCEAGAINST AN OPPONENT WHO IS UNREACHABLE WITH A SINGLE DIRECT ATTACK. VARYING YOURPUNCHING DEPTH IS AN EXAMPLE OF PIA. YOU MAY THROW TWO SHORT PUNCHES KNOWINGFULL WELL THAT YOU WON’T REACH YOUR OPPONENT, BUT THOSE SHORT PUNCHES ALLOW YOUTO BRIDGE THE GAP. THEY ALLOW YOU TO WORK YOUR WAY IN AND THEN DELIVER A BLOW.HENCE THE NAME “PROGRESSIVE.” BRIDGING THE GAP IS A PROGRESSION OF STEPS TO GETTO THE OPPOSITION.THE FEINT, FAKE, OR UNCOMMITTED JAB DRAW YOUR OPPONENT’S ATTENTION, ALLOWING YOUTO WORK INTO STRIKING DISTANCE. I’LL DISCUSS THIS LATER IN THE CHAPTER, BUTREMEMBER THAT YOU CANNOT USE PIA EFFECTIVELY WITH A WEAK STRAIGHT LEAD. IF YOUROPPONENT THINKS YOUR STRAIGHT IS POWDERPUFFERY, HE OR SHE WON’T FALL FOR YOURFAKES OR FEINTS. AND IF YOUR OPPONENT KNOWS THAT YOUR LEAD HAND POSES NO THREAT,HE OR SHE WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO COUNTER YOUR EVERY MOVE.A T T A C K B Y D R A W I N G (A B D)ATTACK BY DRAWING IS ACTUALLY A SECONDARY ATTACK. YOU ARE TRICKING OR LURINGYOUR OPPONENT INTO LAUNCHING AN ATTACK SO THAT YOU MAY COUNTER, USUALLY WITH ASTOP-HIT. YOU SET HIM UP. REMEMBER, YOUR OPPONENT IS AT HIS MOST VULNERABLE ONCEHE HAS COMMITTED TO AN ATTACK. MENTALLY, HE IS NOT THINKING ABOUT DEFENSE.PHYSICALLY, ANY OFFENSIVE MOVEMENT IS GOING TO LEAVE AN OPENING FOR YOUSOMEWHERE. ALSO REMEMBER HOW DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS IT IS TO TRY TO CHANGEDIRECTION IN THE MIDST OF AN ATTACK.THE BEST PART OF ABD, THOUGH, IS THAT BECAUSE YOU ARE SETTING UP YOUR OPPONENT,YOU CAN EASILY PREDICT HIS ATTACK AND COUNTER SAFELY. ABD IS DEPENDENT ONDISTANCE AND TIMING. YOU DELIBERATELY MAKE YOURSELF OPEN AND APPEAR VULNERABLE.HOW YOU DO THIS, AGAIN, ALLOWS YOU TO PREDICT WHAT HE WILL DO. BY GIVING YOUROPPONENT WHAT APPEARS TO BE A PARTICULAR OPENING, YOU ACTUALLY CONTROL THEATTACKS HE MIGHT CHOOSE WHILE ELIMINATING OTHER POSSIBILITIES.AGAIN, THE SUCCESS OF ABD IS ALMOST ENTIRELY CONTINGENT ON TIMING AND DISTANCE.YOU MUST HAVE PRECISE CONTROL OF DISTANCE, KNOWING JUST HOW MUCH SHOULD BEENOUGH TO SAFELY LURE THE OPPOSITION. AND WHEN HE MAKES AN ADVANCE, YOU MUST BEABLE TO TIME HIM. THE HALF-BEAT, THE STOP-HIT, AND THE STEP-IN-STEP-OUT FEINTARE ALL TOOLS FOR IMPLEMENTING ABD. WHEN WE DISCUSS THE VARIATIONS OF THESTRAIGHT LEAD, YOU’LL SEE HOW POSITION OF THE LEAD HAND CAN BE USED TO LURE YOUROPPONENT AS WELL.H A N D I M M O B I L I Z A T I O N A T T A C KWITH HAND IMMOBILIZATION ATTACK, YOU IMMOBILIZE YOUR OPPONENT BY FORCE BYTRAPPING. IN JKD, THIS IS ONE OF THE LAST VESTIGES OF WING CHUN AND EVEN THEN,IT IS USED LESS THAN THE OTHER METHODS OF ATTACK. AS WITH EVERYTHING ELSE INJKD, TRAPPING TECHNIQUES MUST BE KEPT SIMPLE TO BE EFFECTIVE. IT’S BEYOND THESCOPE OF THIS BOOK TO REALLY DISCUSS TRAPPING, BUT KEEP IN MIND THAT WHATEVERTRAPPING TECHNIQUES YOU USE MUST ALSO BE ACCOMPANIED BY APPROPRIATE FOOTWORK.THIS IS WHAT SET LEE’S TRAPPING TECHNIQUE APART FROM OTHERS.24REMEMBER, AS DISCUSSED EARLIER, THAT IN THE LATTER STAGES OF JKD DEVELOPMENT,BRUCE HAD COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT MORE TRADITIONAL FIGHTING ELEMENTS, LIKETRAPPING, WERE NOT THAT EFFECTIVE IN ACTUAL COMBAT. IT WAS ESSENTIALLY THESHORTCOMINGS OF TRADITIONAL TECHNIQUES THAT PROPELLED HIM TO DEVELOP JKD. WINGCHUN, FOR EXAMPLE, REQUIRES BOTH FIGHTERS TO SET UP SO THAT THEIR ARMS ARETOUCHING. THE SYSTEM IS BASED ON TOUCH SENSITIVITY. BUT IN A REAL SITUATION,IT’S UNLIKELY THAT SOMEONE IS GOING TO LEAVE HIS ARM OUT FOR YOU SO YOU CAN SETUP PROPERLY. IF THE OTHER GUY’S UNWILLING TO PLAY YOUR GAME, YOU’RE OUT OF LUCK.BRUCE MAKES A STATEMENT ABOUT TRADITIONAL STYLES IN HIS FIGHT SCENE WITH BOBWALL IN ENTER THE DRAGON. THE TWO SQUARE OFF IN A TRADITIONAL POSITION WITHTHEIR FOREARMS TOUCHING. BUT INSTEAD OF ENGAGING IN A LOT OF BLOCKING ANDUNNECESSARY MOVEMENT, WHAT DOES BRUCE DO? BAM! HE THROWS A STRAIGHT LEAD ANDWHACKS BOB—TWICE. WHY WASTE TIME WHEN YOU CAN LAUNCH THE MOST DIRECT ATTACK?IT’S NO MISTAKE THAT THE TWO START FROM A CLOSE COMBAT SET UP EITHER. BRUCE ISPROVING THAT HE CAN BEAT THE TRAPPERS AT THEIR OWN GAME WITHOUT HAVING TOACTUALLY ENGAGE IN TRAPPING. KNOWING A FEW SIMPLE TRAPPING TECHNIQUES MAY BEUSEFUL IF YOU CHOOSE TO PLAY THE GAME, BUT THE STRAIGHT LEAD GETS THE JOB DONEQUICKER.OF COURSE, AS NADI EMPHASIZED, TO EXECUTE THE SIMPLEST, MOST DIRECT ATTACKREQUIRES TREMENDOUS SPEED, AND THIS IS WHAT EVENTUALLY ENABLED BRUCE TO ABANDONWING CHUN. TO REALLY APPRECIATE THE SCENE FROM ENTER THE DRAGON, YOU’LL HAVE TOWATCH IT FRAME BY FRAME, BECAUSE BRUCE WAS SO INCREDIBLY FAST. YOU’LL SEE THATTHE STRAIGHT LEAD IS DECEPTIVELY SIMPLE. IT TAKES YEARS TO DEVELOP THE NECESSARYMUSCLE MEMORY, ALIGNMENT, FOOTWORK, AND MECHANICS THAT COLLECTIVELY CONTRIBUTETO SPEED AND POWER. IT TAKES YEARS TO HONE SOMETHING THAT IS, FOR THE MOST PART,IMPERCEPTIBLE TO THE UNTRAINED EYE. SEE FIGURES 97 THROUGH 99.[../Images/158a.jpg]FIGURE 97: PLAYING THE TRAPPING GAME. I THROW OUT A FINGER JAB THAT IS BLOCKEDBY MY OPPONENT.[../Images/158b.jpg]FIGURE 98: AS I’M BEING BLOCKED, I IMMEDIATELY TRAP HIS ARM AND THROW A STRAIGHTLEAD.[../Images/159a.jpg]FIGURE 99: EVEN IN CLOSE QUARTERS, I’VE USED FOOTWORK TO BRIDGE THE GAP ANDPROPERLY EXECUTE THE PUNCH. THE ALIGNMENT AND MECHANICS ARE THE SAME. THE ONLYDIFFERENCE IS THE DISTANCE COVERED, WHICH IS REGULATED BY MY BACK FOOT.[../Images/2.jpg]H I T F I R S T, H I T H A R D, H I T O F T E NTHE FIVE WAYS OF ATTACK ARE OF LITTLE USE TO US IF WE DO NOT IMMEDIATELYESTABLISH THE VALIDITY OF THE STRAIGHT LEAD. YOU MUST LET YOUR OPPONENT KNOWFROM THE GET GO THAT YOUR LEAD HAND IS DANGEROUS, A THREAT. MAKE HIM RESPECTYOU. POP HIM A FEW TIMES RIGHT OFF THE BAT WITH THAT RAPIER-LIKE STRAIGHT LEAD.ONCE HE KNOWS YOU CAN HIT HIM—AND FROM A DISCONCERTING DISTANCE—THE REST IS APIECE OF CAKE. FROM THAT MOMENT ON, HE WILL REACT, EVEN FLINCH, WHENEVER YOUMAKE A MOVE. IF YOU FEINT, HE’LL FALL FOR IT. IF YOU THROW A SHORT JAB, HE’LL BEPUT OFF BALANCE IN ANTICIPATION OF A MORE DAMAGING BLOW. THEN HE’S A SITTINGDUCK FOR WHATEVER PUNCH WITH WHICH YOU CARE TO FOLLOW UP.BUT YOU CAN ONLY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS IF YOU HAVE A STRONG LEAD. THIS IS WHYIT’S SO IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE MECHANICS DOWN. YOU’VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO GENERATEFORCE AND LET THE OPPOSITION FEEL IT. AS DEMPSEY WROTE, THE TIMID, LIGHT LEADJAB, IS OF LITTLE VALUE IN THE RING:> ANY TIME YOU EXTEND YOUR LEFT FIST FOR A TAP OR FOR AN ALL-OUT PUNCH, YOU’RE> TAKING A GAMBLE ON BEING NAILED WITH A COUNTER-PUNCH. . . AN OPPONENT WHO IS> DEFENDING ONLY AGAINST TAPS AND SLAPS WILL BE MUCH MORE ALERT TO COUNTER THAN> WILL AN OPPONENT WHO IS BEING BOMBED.25SO, REMEMBER WITH THE STRAIGHT LEAD WE WANT TO BOMB. DRISCOLL HAD A SIMILARTHEORY REGARDING THE STRAIGHT. IT MUST BE TECHNICALLY SOUND AND DAMAGING BEFOREIT CAN BE USED STRATEGICALLY:> FOR NO MATTER HOW STRAIGHTLY IT MAY BE USED, NOR HOW FREQUENTLY IT MAY SHOOT> OUT, THE LEFT PUNCH IS OF PRECIOUS LITTLE USE AS AN OFFENSIVE WEAPON, AND EVEN> ABSOLUTELY USELESS AS A DEFENSIVE ONE UNLESS IT IS CAPABLE OF CHECKING AN> ATTACK AND EVEN OF STOPPING MOST ATTACKS. I WOULD GIVE THE SAME ADVICE TO> BOXERS AS THAT WHICH LORD FISHER LAID DOWN AS THE RULE TO BE OBEYED IN ALL> NAVAL COMBATS, VIZ., TO HIT FIRST, HIT HARD, AND HIT OFTEN, WITH THE ADDENDUM> THAT THEY SHOULD ALWAYS, OR PRACTICALLY ALWAYS, “HIT STRAIGHT.”26THE PROGRESSIVE INDIRECT ATTACK AND CERTAINLY THE SINGLE DIRECT ATTACK ARE ONLYPOSSIBLE WITH A DEADLY LEAD HAND.27[../Images/2.jpg]T H E P A R A D O X O F S I M P L I C I T YWE’VE JUST DISCUSSED THE MORE ADVANCED CONCEPTS OF TIMING AND DISTANCE, BUT I’DLIKE TO REITERATE THE EMPHASIS BRUCE PLACED ON SIMPLICITY, BECAUSE NOW WE ARETALKING ABOUT APPLICATION. WHEN YOU ARE PLACED IN AN ACTUAL COMBATIVE SITUATION,THE ABSTRACT CONCEPT OF SIMPLICITY BECOMES GLARINGLY CONCRETE. I NEVER FULLYAPPRECIATED THE STRAIGHT LEAD UNTIL I STARTED TO SPAR. ITS DESIGN, MECHANICS,AND HOW IT LENDS ITSELF TO INSTINCTUAL USE SUDDENLY MADE PERFECT SENSE.NOW I UNDERSTAND WHEN BRUCE WROTE, “WHEN THE STUDENT BEGINS TO SPAR, THEN HEWILL STOP SEARCHING FOR THE ACCUMULATION OF TECHNIQUES; RATHER HE WILL DEVOTETHE NEEDED HOURS OF PRACTICE TO THE SIMPLE TECHNIQUE FOR ITS RIGHT EXECUTION.”28FOR SO-CALLED JKD PRACTITIONERS WHO INSIST ON THE ENDLESS ACCUMULATION OFTECHNIQUES, I CAN ONLY GUESS THAT THEY DO NOT SPAR. FOR IN THE HEAT OF BATTLE,THERE IS NO TIME TO THINK. THE MORE STEPS NEEDED FOR AN ATTACK, THE MORE TIME ISWASTED IN THOUGHT. THE FLASHIER THE TECHNIQUE, THE MORE TIME IS WASTED MAKINGEXCESS MOTION.ACCORDING TO BRUCE, SIMPLICITY IS WHAT MAKES AN ATTACK UNBEATABLE: “THERE IS NOEFFECTIVE TRICK TO STOP A PROPERLY TIMED SIMPLE ATTACK, AND ALWAYS REMEMBER THEBEST TECHNIQUE IN OFFENSE OR DEFENSE IS THE SIMPLE ONE PROPERLY PERFORMED.”29 NOWAY TO STOP A GOOD SIMPLE ATTACK. AND THERE IS NO SIMPLER ATTACK THAN POPPINGYOUR OPPONENT WITH A SINGLE STRAIGHT LEAD. SEE FIGURE 100.[../Images/161a.jpg]FIGURE 100: IT DOESN’T GET ANY SIMPLER THAN THIS. AS YOUR OPPONENT MOVES IN TOATTACK, THROWING A PERFECTLY TIMED STRAIGHT IS, ALL AT ONCE, BOTH THE PERFECTDEFENSIVE AND OFFENSIVE MOVE.THE IRONY, OF COURSE, IS THAT THE SIMPLEST PUNCH IS ACTUALLY THE MOST DIFFICULTTO MASTER. AS NADI WROTE, “THE SIMPLEST OF ALL ATTACKS IS THE STRAIGHT THRUST.BECAUSE OF ITS SIMPLICITY, THIS ATTACK IS THE MOST DIFFICULT TO EXECUTE INCOMBAT. TO BE SUCCESSFUL, IT REQUIRES PERFECT TIMING, EXACT DISTANCE, ANDTREMENDOUS SPEED.”30THIS IS THE PARADOX OF SIMPLICITY. THE SIMPLER YOUR ATTACK, THE MORE CRUCIAL THEELEMENTS OF TIMING AND DISTANCE BECOME. AND AS WE’VE ALREADY SEEN, ACHIEVING THENECESSARY SPEED, WHICH REQUIRES MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY, DEPENDS ON EXCELLENT FORMAND PRECISE MECHANICS. THIS IS WHAT BRUCE LEE MEANT WHEN HE SPOKE OF “DAILYDECREASE.” YOUR AIM SHOULD NOT BE TO COMPLICATE EXISTING TECHNIQUES OR ACQUIRENEW ONES. TRUE MASTERY IS A PROCESS OF CONSTANT REFINEMENT, AND AS YOU APPROACHTECHNICAL PERFECTION, YOU APPROACH ABSOLUTE SIMPLICITY.[../Images/2.jpg]N O T E S1 IN CONVERSATION WITH TED WONG, MARCH 18, 2004.2 BRUCE LEE, ED.

THE INITIALSPEED OF THE BODY SHOULD, THEREFORE, BE IN DIRECT PROPORTION TO THE SIMPLICITYOR COMPLEXITY OF THE ACTION.”1 AS WE’VE STRESSED IN THE LAST CHAPTER, THESTRAIGHT LEAD, AND MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE SINGLE DIRECT ATTACK, IS THE SIMPLEST,AND THEREFORE, MOST DIFFICULT OF ALL ATTACKS. ITS SIMPLICITY MAKES ITPARADOXICALLY THE ATTACK THAT CALLS FOR THE HIGHEST SKILL LEVEL, AND SPEED IS ATTHE TOP OF THE LIST OF SKILLS REQUIRED. THE SUBJECT OF SPEED, THEN, WARRANTSHAVING ITS OWN LITTLE CHAPTER.BRUCE LEE WROTE THAT THE TWO MAIN COMPONENTS OF SPEED WERE RECOGNITION ANDREACTION. HE THEN FURTHER BROKE IT DOWN INTO FIVE SEPARATE COMPONENTS:PERCEPTUAL, MENTAL, INITIATION, PERFORMANCE, AND ALTERATION.2[../Images/2.jpg]P E R C E P T U A L S P E E DTHIS IS ESSENTIALLY HOW FAST YOU CAN RECOGNIZE A MOVEMENT OR STRIKINGOPPORTUNITY. IT IS, FOR THE MOST PART, VISUAL, ALTHOUGH AUDITORY CUES MAYSOMETIMES BE HELPFUL. PERCEPTUAL SPEED IS HOW FAST YOU CAN SEE OR RECOGNIZE ANATTACK TO SPEEDILY EVADE OR HOW FAST YOU CAN SEE AN OPENING GIVING YOU THEADVANTAGE WHEN STRIKING. TED WONG REMARKED THAT BRUCE WOULD JUST WATCH PEOPLE TODEVELOP HIS SKILLS OF PERCEPTION—HOW THEY RUN, WALK, SWING THEIR ARMS, EVEN HOWTHEY’D HOLD A FORK.3 TRAINING FOR PERCEPTUAL SPEED IS TRAINING YOUR EYE TO SEETHINGS QUICKLY.[../Images/165a.jpg]FIGURE 101: THE SIMPLER THE PUNCH, THE GREATER THE REQUIRED SPEED.VISION AWARENESS CAN COMPENSATE, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, FOR A SLOW DELIVERY, ANDTHE GOOD NEWS IS THAT IT’S SOMETHING YOU CAN CULTIVATE.4 ONE HELPFUL HINT IS NOTTO FOCUS ON ANY ONE AREA OF THE TARGET. I DON’T KNOW WHERE THIS MYTH CAME FROMABOUT FIXING YOUR GAZE ON YOUR OPPONENT’S EYES. MAYBE A QUICK GLANCE, BUT YOUROPPONENT’S NOT GOING TO HIT YOU WITH HIS OR HER EYES! INSTEAD USE YOURPERIPHERAL VISION TO TRY TO GET A SENSE OF THE POSITION OF YOUR OPPONENT’SENTIRE BODY. TAKE IN YOUR OPPONENT FROM HEAD TO TOE WITHOUT FOCUSING ON ANY ONEPOINT. “A HABIT OF DIFFUSING THE ATTENTION OVER A WIDER AREA,” BRUCE WROTE,“HELPS THE OFFENSIVE PASSER TO SEE OPENINGS MORE QUICKLY.”5 BY DOING SO, YOU’LLBE ABLE TO DETECT BOTH KICKS AND PUNCHES AND FROM WHICH SIDE THEY’LL ORIGINATE.A SHOULDER TWITCH. A SLIGHT WIND-UP. TRAIN YOUR EYES TO DETECT THE SMALLESTMOVEMENTS, AND YOU’LL BE ABLE TO ANTICIPATE AND COUNTER YOUR OPPONENT MUCH MOREEFFECTIVELY.[../Images/2.jpg]M E N T A L S P E E DTED WONG BELIEVES THAT 70 PERCENT OF SPEED IS MENTAL, AND ONLY 30 PERCENT ISPHYSICAL. MENTAL SPEED, ACCORDING TO THE TAO, IS HOW QUICKLY YOUR MIND CHOOSES APARTICULAR MOVEMENT.6 THE IRONY HERE, THOUGH, IS THAT AT THE HIGHEST SPEEDS,THERE IS NO MENTAL EFFORT BEING EXERTED. OR WE SHOULD SAY, THERE IS NO CONSCIOUSMENTAL EFFORT. THE HIGHEST STAGE OF ANY ART IS THAT STATE OF “NO MINDEDNESS.”TO ACHIEVE THIS, THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS THAT MUST BE IN PLACE. FIRST, YOU MUSTKEEP YOUR ARSENAL OF WEAPONS TO A MINIMUM. AS I MENTIONED IN THE LAST CHAPTER,THE FEWER CHOICES YOU HAVE TO RIFLE THROUGH, THE FASTER YOU WILL BE. TAKE A FEWOF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WEAPONS, AND KEEP IT SIMPLE. THE STRAIGHT LEAD OR THRUST,AS DRISCOLL AND NADI HAVE MENTIONED, IS THE SIMPLEST ATTACK OR COUNTER. WHEN ITHAS BEEN LEARNED PROPERLY, ITS SIMPLICITY LENDS ITSELF TO INSTINCTUAL USE.REMEMBER:> SPEED OF PERCEPTION IS SOMEWHAT AFFECTED BY THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE OBSERVER’S> ATTENTION—FEWER SEPARATE CHOICES, FASTER ACTION. WHEN THE CUE TO BE RECOGNIZED> IS LIKELY TO BE ONE OF SEVERAL, EACH OF WHICH REQUIRES A DIFFERENT RESPONSE,> THE TIME IS LENGTHENED. CHOICE REACTION TAKES LONGER THAN SIMPLE REACTION.> THIS IS THE BASIS FOR TRAINING THE TOOLS IN TERMS OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL> ADJUSTMENT TOWARD INSTINCTIVE ECONOMY. INSTINCTIVE MOVEMENT, BEING THE> SIMPLEST, IS THE QUICKEST AND MOST ACCURATE.7YOU MUST ALSO TRAIN YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM. WE’VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUTNEUROMUSCULAR PROGRAMMING. WITH HOURS OF PROPER PROGRAMMING, YOU WILL REACH ASTATE WHERE YOU DO NOT HAVE TO THINK ABOUT FORM, OR SEQUENCE, OR EVEN DISTANCEAND TIMING. YOUR BODY WILL KNOW.THIS GOES HAND IN HAND WITH FORM AND MECHANICS. AS BRUCE WROTE, “MANY FIGHTERSFAIL TO APPRECIATE HOW MUCH TRUE SPEED DEPENDS ON ECONOMY OF MOTION (I.E., GOODFORM AND GOOD COORDINATION).”8 REMEMBER THE STANCE ITSELF WAS DESIGNED FOROPTIMAL SPEED AND MINIMAL DEVIATION WHEN MAKING A MOTION. THIS ALSO WHY WE PUNCHSTRAIGHT. IT REQUIRES LESS DISTANCE TO REACH THE TARGET, AND THEREFORE, LESSTIME. A SWINGING PUNCH MUST TRAVEL A GREATER DISTANCE AND TAKES MORE TIME.ONCE YOU’RE IN THE PROPER STANCE, REMEMBER THE SEQUENCE OF MOVEMENT ANDMECHANICS. IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO PERFORM THESE CORRECTLY, YOU WILL SACRIFICE AGREAT DEAL OF SPEED. REMEMBER WHEN PRACTICING—DO NOT SKIP STEPS OR GLOSS OVERMECHANICS. YOU WILL BE PROGRAMMING YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM INCORRECTLY, AND IT TAKESMUCH MORE TIME TO DEPROGRAM YOURSELF THAN IT DOES TO GET THE TECHNIQUE RIGHT THEFIRST TIME AROUND. GO SLOWLY. TAKE THE TIME TO LEARN THINGS CORRECTLY, AND THISWILL PAY OFF. SOMEDAY, WHEN YOU NEED IT, THAT TECHNIQUE AND SPEED WILL BE ATYOUR FINGERTIPS, AND YOU WON’T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT. REMEMBER WHAT BRUCE SAIDIN ENTER THE DRAGON: “I DO NOT HIT. IT HITS ALL BY ITSELF.” THIS IS HOW WEDEFINE MENTAL SPEED.DON’T FORGET THAT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MENTAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO SPEEDIS RELAXATION. RELAX, MAX! FIRST, BEING PHYSICALLY RELAXED KEEPS YOU FROMUNNECESSARILY TENSING MUSCLES NOT USED IN THE TECHNIQUE. IF YOU’RE TENSE, UPONPERCEIVING AN OPPORTUNITY, YOU MUST FIRST RELAX THE TENSED MUSCLES BEFORE YOUCAN MOVE. YOU LOSE VALUABLE MILLISECONDS, OR EVEN SECONDS, THAT WAY.SECOND, MENTAL TENSION MAY CLOUD YOUR HEAD, BECAUSE YOU’RE CONSCIOUSLY THINKINGTOO MUCH. FOR YOUR STRAIGHT LEAD TO “HIT ALL BY ITSELF,” YOU CANNOT BE THINKING.[../Images/2.jpg]I N I T I A T I O N S P E E DINITIATION SPEED IS HOW QUICKLY YOU CAN OVERCOME INERTIA. THE STANCE ISESPECIALLY IMPORTANT HERE, BECAUSE, AS DEFINED BY BRUCE, INITIATION SPEEDREQUIRES “ECONOMICAL STARTING FROM THE RIGHT POSTURE.”9 WHEN WE THINK OF SPEED,WE GENERALLY THINK OF SOMETHING MOVING REALLY FAST EXTERNALLY. BUT TO TRULYUNDERSTAND SPEED, WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE. TO THROW A FASTSTRAIGHT LEAD, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU MUST FIRST PUSH OFF THE LEFT LEG. TO PUSH OFFWITH MAXIMUM ACCELERATION, YOU MUST START FROM THE PROPER STANCE.REMEMBER OUR DISCUSSION OF BODY FEEL. AGAIN, THIS IS SOMETHING YOU CANNOT SEE.BUT YOU NEED TO FEEL ALL OF THAT POTENTIAL ENERGY BOTTLED UP. YOU SHOULD FEELTHE POTENTIAL ENERGY STORED ON THE MEDIAL SIDES OF YOUR LEGS, CONCENTRATED ONTHE BALL OF YOUR LEFT FOOT. FEEL YOUR UPPER BODY COILED AND READY TO WHIP OUT ATTHE HIP. THESE ARE ALL CONTRIBUTORS TO INITIATION SPEED, AND THEY CAN ONLY BEACHIEVED FROM A PROPERLY CONSTRUCTED STANCE. WHEN YOU ARE IN THE STANCE, YOUSHOULD FEEL READY TO UNLEASH A LIGHTNING BOLT AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT.ONCE YOU HAVE GRASPED THE PRINCIPLES OF A CORRECT STANCE AND YOUR BODY IS ABLETO FEEL THEM, I SUGGEST YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE STANCES OF OTHER FIGHTERS. WHATARE THEY DOING RIGHT? WRONG? DO YOU THINK THEY’LL BE FAST? SLOW? WHEN YOU KNOWHOW A PROPER STANCE FEELS, YOU CAN TRAIN YOUR EYE TO SEE SUCH THINGS. YOU’LLHAVE A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT TO EXPECT FROM A FIGHTER JUST BY OBSERVING HIS OR HERSTANCE.[../Images/2.jpg]P E R F O R M A N C E S P E E DPERFORMANCE IS THE ACTUAL MOVEMENT. IF INITIATION SPEED IS LARGELY INTERNAL,PERFORMANCE SPEED IS THE EXTERNAL MOVEMENT THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE. IT GOESWITHOUT SAYING THAT PERFORMANCE SPEED IS DEPENDENT ON PRECISE MECHANICS AND THEPROPER SEQUENCE. EVERY STEP IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT, FROM THE INITIAL PUSH-OFF TOTHE RETRACTION OF THE HAND. I SOUND LIKE A BROKEN RECORD BY NOW, BUT PERFORMANCESPEED IS DEVELOPED BY NEUROMUSCULAR PROGRAMMING—IN OTHER WORDS, PRACTICE,PRACTICE, PRACTICE. THERE’S NO OTHER WAY TO PROGRAM THOSE NEUROMUSCULARPATHWAYS.PERFORMANCE SPEED, BY THE WAY, APPLIES NOT ONLY TO THE SINGLE STRAIGHT LEAD, BUTALSO TO COMBINATIONS AS WELL. TO PERFORM COMBINATIONS EFFECTIVELY, YOU MUSTSMOOTHLY TRANSITION FROM TECHNIQUE TO TECHNIQUE. THIS IS DEPENDENT ONCOORDINATION OF MECHANICS, FOOTWORK, AND WEIGHT TRANSFER.[../Images/2.jpg]A L T E R A T I O N S P E E DALTERATION SPEED IS HOW QUICKLY YOU CAN CHANGE DIRECTION IN MID-MOTION. YOUALREADY KNOW THAT IT’S INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT, IF NOT DOWNRIGHT DANGEROUS, TO STOPA PUNCH ONCE YOU’VE COMMITTED TO THROWING IT. THIS IS WHY FIGHTERS ARE SOVULNERABLE TO COUNTERS. ALTERATION SPEED REQUIRES A GREAT DEAL OF SKILL. YOUNEED IT TO THROW COMBOS AND TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL THE STRATEGIC TOOLS LIKEBROKEN RHYTHM, THE STOP AND GO, THE STEP-IN-STEP-OUT FEINT. TO CHANGE UP SPEEDAND/OR DIRECTION REQUIRES AN EXTREMELY HIGH LEVEL OF COORDINATION, FOR ANYEXCESSIVE MOTION WILL SLOW YOU DOWN. SWING TOO WIDE AND YOU HAVE THAT MUCH MOREDISTANCE TO RECOVER BEFORE YOU’RE READY TO FIRE AGAIN. AS WITH THE OTHER TYPESOF SPEED, YOU MUST THINK PRECISION AND ECONOMY, ECONOMY, ECONOMY.[../Images/2.jpg]N O T E S1 ALDO NADI, ON FENCING, (BANGOR, ME: LAUREATE PRESS, 1994), P. 151.2 BRUCE LEE, TAO OF JEET KUNE DO (SANTA CLARITA, CA, OHARA PUBLICATIONS, INC.,1975), PP. 56–59.3 IN CONVERSATION WITH TED WONG, MARCH 8, 2004.4 LEE, TAO OF JEET KUNE DO, P. 54.

THIS IS THE BACKBONE OF JKD AND IS THEPUNCH YOU WILL THROW MOST OFTEN, BUT IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS, IT WILL BE MOREAPPROPRIATE TO THROW A VARIATION OF THE STRAIGHT. THOSE VARIATIONS INCLUDE THECORKSCREW HOOK, BACKFIST, AND SHOVEL HOOK.THERE ARE, OF COURSE, OTHER PUNCHES IN JKD THAT ACT AS SUPPORTING PLAYERS LIKETHE HOOK, UPPERCUT, AND REAR CROSS. AS I’VE SAID BEFORE, THERE ARE VERY FEWPUNCHES IN JKD. IN FACT, I’VE LISTED THEM ALL ALREADY—THE STRAIGHT, CROSS, HOOK,UPPERCUT, BACKFIST, CORKSCREW, SHOVEL HOOK. BUT ONCE AGAIN, SIMPLICITY ISDECEPTIVE. BETWEEN A PURE STRAIGHT AND A PURE HOOK LIES AN ENTIRE CONTINUUM OFPUNCHES THAT INCLUDES A BLEND OF BOTH. WE WON’T BE ABLE TO GO INTO TOO MUCHDETAIL WITH THIS CONTINUUM, BUT THIS CONCEPT SHOULD HELP YOU TO UNDERSTAND THEFIRST VARIATION OF THE STRAIGHT, THE CORKSCREW HOOK.[../Images/2.jpg]T H E C O R K S C R E W H O O KTHERE ARE A COUPLE OF INSTANCES WHEN IT IS BETTER TO THROW A CORKSCREW HOOKINSTEAD OF A PURE STRAIGHT LEAD. THE FIRST IS IF YOUR TARGET CIRCLES TO YOURLEFT SIDE (COUNTERCLOCKWISE). TO HIT HIM IN TIME, BEFORE HE CAN MOVE AGAIN, YOUWILL HAVE TO PIVOT STEP TO GET TO HIM.TO THROW A CORKSCREW HOOK, START FROM THE REGULAR ON-GUARD POSITION. AS YOUSHOOT OUT, THOUGH, YOU WILL ACTUALLY RAISE YOUR ELBOW AND TURN YOUR PALM OVER.REMEMBER, YOU DO NOT DO THIS WHEN A TARGET IS DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF YOU. THAT’SWHEN YOU USE A STRAIGHT. THE CORKSCREW IS USED WHEN THE TARGET IS TO YOUR LEFT.YOUR ELBOW SHOULD BE UP, GIVING YOU EXTRA TORQUE INTO THE TARGET AND A DOWNWARDTRAJECTORY AS WELL. AND ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS LAND THE TARGET WITH THE BOTTOMTHREE KNUCKLES.[../Images/171a.jpg]FIGURE 102: KEEPING THE FRONT HAND LOW IS NOT THE FASTEST WAY TO THROW ASTRAIGHT LEAD, BUT IT GIVES YOU MORE OPTIONS TO THROW OTHER PUNCHES AND KEEPSYOUR OPPONENT GUESSING.THE PIVOT STEP, WHICH CAN BE TRACED TO DEMPSEY’S BOOK, IS CRUCIAL TO THECORKSCREW, BECAUSE YOU WILL NEED TO REDIRECT YOUR BODY WEIGHT TOWARD THE TARGET,WHICH IS NOW TOWARD YOUR LEFT. REMEMBER, YOU ALWAYS WANT YOUR HIP POINTINGTOWARD THE TARGET, BECAUSE THAT MEANS THE MAJORITY OF YOUR BODY WEIGHT, YOURTRUNK, IS HEADED IN THE DESIRED DIRECTION.1 SEE FIGURES 103 THROUGH 105.BECAUSE YOU ARE ANGLING TO YOUR RIGHT (COUNTERCLOCKWISE), YOUR POWER LINECHANGES, SO YOU WILL ACTUALLY HIT WITH THE PALM DOWN. YOU CAN TEST THIS THEORYWITH THE HEAVY BAG. TRY THROWING A STRAIGHT WITH THE THUMB UP AS YOU CIRCLE THEBAG TO YOUR RIGHT. FEELS PRETTY AWKWARD, RIGHT? NOW TRY PIVOTING TO THE RIGHTAND THROW STRAIGHTS WITH YOUR PALM DOWN. YOU SHOULD FEEL MUCH MORE SOLID WITHYOUR ELBOW UP AND PALM DOWN. THIS IS THE ONLY CASE WHEN IT IS ADVANTAGEOUS TOLAND A BLOW WITH THE PALM DOWN, AND THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE ANGLE AND YOUR BODYSTRUCTURE.2[../Images/172a.jpg]FIGURE 103: THE CORKSCREW HOOK FROM ON GUARD.[../Images/172b.jpg]FIGURE 104: AS YOUR HAND SHOOTS OUT, YOU MUST ALSO PIVOT STEP.[../Images/173a.jpg]FIGURE 105: AT IMPACT, YOUR PALM IS DOWN AND YOUR ELBOW SHOULD ANGLE UP.SO, AGAIN, ONE INSTANCE IN WHICH YOU WOULD USE THE CORKSCREW WOULD BE TO HIT ATARGET THAT IS HIGH AND SLIGHTLY TO YOUR LEFT. THE OTHER WOULD BE IF YOU WERETOO CLOSE TO THE TARGET TO THROW AN EFFECTIVE STRAIGHT. THE PURE STRAIGHT LEADIS A LONG-RANGE PUNCH USED FOR A ONE-SHOT DEAL OR TO BRIDGE THE GAP TO THEOPPOSITION. IT MUST BE THROWN FROM AN OPTIMAL DISTANCE TO BE EFFECTIVE. IF YOUARE TOO CLOSE TO THE TARGET, YOU LOSE LEVERAGE AND END UP PUSHING INSTEAD OFFORCEFULLY STRIKING. TO MAINTAIN LEVERAGE AT CLOSE RANGE, THEN, YOU CAN THROW ACORKSCREW HOOK. RAISING YOUR ELBOW ALLOWS YOU TO “ANGLE UP,” IN THIS WAY, YOUOPTIMIZE YOUR LEVERAGE AND AVOID JAMMING YOURSELF. SEE FIGURES 106 AND 107.THERE ARE VARYING DEGREES OF ANGLING UP. AT ITS MOST EXTREME, YOU ARE ALMOSTTHROWING A HOOK, SO THE CORKSCREW MAY BE USED WHEN YOUR HAND IS POSITIONEDSLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT OF WHERE IT WOULD BE IN THE NORMAL STANCE. AT THE OTHEREND OF THE SPECTRUM, YOU MAY NEARLY THROW A STRAIGHT WITH A SLIGHT CORKSCREWTWIST. THE CORKSCREW LIES SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE ON THE STRAIGHT-HOOKCONTINUUM.[../Images/174a.jpg]FIGURE 106: SIDE VIEW OF CORKSCREW HOOK FROM THE STANCE.[../Images/174b.jpg]FIGURE 107: SIDE VIEW OF PIVOT STEPPING AND ANGLING UP FOR THE CORKSCREW HOOK.[../Images/2.jpg]T H E B A C K F I S TIF YOU USE THE CORKSCREW WHEN YOUR OPPONENT IS MOVING TO YOUR LEFT OR WHEN YOURHAND IS SLIGHTLY TO THE OUTSIDE (RIGHT) OF THE STANDARD STANCE POSITION, THENYOU USE THE BACKFIST IN THE OPPOSITE APPROACH—WHEN YOUR HAND IS SLIGHTLY TO THELEFT OF ITS NORMAL POSITION OR WHEN YOUR OPPONENT IS JUST TO YOUR RIGHT.UNLIKE ANY OTHER PUNCH IN JKD, THE LANDING SURFACE FOR THE BACKFIST IS THE BACKOF THE BOTTOM THREE KNUCKLES. IT MAY BE ARGUED THAT THE BACKFIST IS THE FASTESTPUNCH IN JKD, FOR IT LENDS ITSELF TO AN EASY WHIPLIKE MOTION, BUT YOU DO NOT GETAS MUCH POWER WITH IT AS YOU DO WITH THE PURE STRAIGHT. YOU JUST CANNOT GENERATEAS MUCH FORCE COMING FROM THIS ANGLE AS YOU DO SHOOTING YOUR HAND STRAIGHT OUT.STILL, A FAST, STINGING BACKFIST CAN CERTAINLY DO DAMAGE.FINGER JABS ARE OFTEN INCORPORATED INTO THE BACKFIST MOTION. THIS PUNCH CAN ALSOBE COMBINED WITH THE STRAIGHT LEAD BY STARTING OUT WITH A BACKFIST MOTION ANDTHEN LANDING WITH THE SAME SURFACE AREA AS YOU WOULD A REGULAR STRAIGHT LEAD.(FRONT AS OPPOSED TO BACK OF THE BOTTOM THREE KNUCKLES). FOOTWORK FOR THEBACKFIST IS THE SAME AS FOR THE REGULAR STRAIGHT LEAD. SEE FIGURES 108 THROUGH110.[../Images/175a.jpg]FIGURE 108: THE BACKFIST FROM A MODIFIED JKD STANCE. NOTICE THAT THE ELBOWPOINTS OUTWARD AND IS NOT TUCKED IN CLOSE TO THE BODY AS USUAL.[../Images/176a.jpg]FIGURE 109: HAND SHOOTING OUT FOR BACKFIST.[../Images/176b.jpg]FIGURE 110: THE BACKFIST AT IMPACT.[../Images/2.jpg]S H O V E L H O O KTHE SHOVEL HOOK GIVES YOU AN OPTION TO THROW A LOW-LINE VERSION OF THE STRAIGHT.ITS HOOKING RELATIVE IS THE UPPERCUT. WHEN YOU MOVE INTO A CROUCH, USUALLYACCOMPANIED BY A SLIGHT WEAVE TO THE RIGHT, YOU WILL BE IN POSITION TO THROW ASHOVEL HOOK. THIS IS OFTEN WHERE YOU COME OUT OF AN EVASIVE MOVE, SO THE SHOVELHOOK MAKES A GOOD COUNTER. WHEN YOU MOVE OUT OF THE REGULAR STANCE INTO A CROUCHAND WEAVE, YOUR HAND AUTOMATICALLY TURNS OVER INTO A PALMS-UP POSITION. FROMTHERE, YOU SIMPLY SHOOT OUT YOUR LEAD HAND WITH THE PALM UP, AGAIN, LANDING WITHTHE BOTTOM THREE KNUCKLES. AS WITH ALL JKD PUNCHES, YOU MUST ROTATE YOUR HIPS SOTHAT YOUR RIGHT HIP POINTS TOWARD THE TARGET. TO BOTH FACILITATE AND MAXIMIZEROTATION, THE SHOVEL HOOK IS USUALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A PIVOT STEP. SHOVEL HOOKSARE ESPECIALLY USEFUL FOR SOLAR PLEXUS AND KIDNEY SHOTS. SEE FIGURES 111 THROUGH114.[../Images/177a.jpg]FIGURE 111: SIDE VIEW OF SHOVEL HOOK. THE FRONT HAND IS POSITIONED SO THATEXTENSION OF THE ARM MAKES THIS A LINEAR, OR STRAIGHT, PUNCH.[../Images/178a.jpg]FIGURE 112: SIDE VIEW OF UPPERCUT. POSITION OF THE HAND IN THIS CASE MAKES THEUPPERCUT A VERTICAL PUNCH, NOT A STRAIGHT PUNCH.[../Images/178b.jpg]FIGURE 113: FRONT VIEW OF SHOVEL HOOK, A VARIATION OF THE STRAIGHT LEAD, ATIMPACT.[../Images/179a.jpg]FIGURE 114: FRONT VIEW OF UPPERCUT, WHICH IS NOT A STRAIGHT PUNCH, AT IMPACT.[../Images/2.jpg]T H E D R O P - S H I F TANOTHER LOW-LINE VERSION OF THE STRAIGHT, THE DROP-SHIFT IS A GREAT WAY TOREMAIN UNPREDICTABLE. YOU CAN SHOOT LOW WITH A DROP-SHIFT AND THEN HIGH OR VICEVERSA. THE DROP-SHIFT IS ONE OF YOUR SAFER OFFENSIVE MOVES, SINCE YOU CAN CHANGEBOTH YOUR HEIGHT AND ANGLE. YOUR OPPONENT WILL HAVE A HARDER TIME COUNTERING.THE DROP-SHIFT MAY BE THROWN WITH EITHER HAND. WHEN THROWN WITH THE LEAD HAND,YOU WILL HAVE TO TURN YOUR PALM DOWN. AS WITH THE CORKSCREW, THIS HAS TO DO WITHTHE ANGLE AND YOUR POWER LINE. TO EXECUTE A DROP-SHIFT, DROP INTO A CROUCHEDPOSITION. THIS DOES NOT MEAN JUST YOUR UPPER BODY. BEND AT THE KNEES. THE LEADHAND DROP-SHIFT IS USUALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A SIDE STEP THE TO THE LEFT OR A PIVOTTO THE RIGHT. AGAIN, YOU ARE ABLE TO ALTER BOTH YOUR HEIGHT AND ANGLE, MAKINGYOU MORE ELUSIVE.3 WHEN FACING A JABBER, THE DROP-SHIFT IS A GOOD COUNTERINGOPTION.4 SEE FIGURES 115 AND 116.[../Images/180a.jpg]FIGURE 115: SIDE VIEW OF THE DROP-SHIFT.[../Images/180b.jpg]FIGURE 116: THE FRONT VIEW OF THE DROP-SHIFT.[../Images/2.jpg]H A N D P O S I T I O NIF YOU’VE STUDIED ANY FOOTAGE OF BRUCE LEE ON FILM, THEN YOU KNOW THERE WAS SOMEVARIATION IN THE WAY HE HELD THE LEAD HAND. AGAIN, TO THROW A PURE STRAIGHT, THEFASTEST POSSIBLE LEAD PUNCH, WE START FROM THE STANCE—ELBOW BENT, TARGET WITHINTHE GUNSIGHT. THIS GIVES US THE LEAST DISTANCE TO TRAVEL TO THE TARGET.WHEN WE SPAR, HOWEVER, WE’RE DEALING WITH DIFFERENT RANGES, ANGLES, PUNCHES, ANDCOMBOS. LOWERING YOUR HAND CAN BE USED TO BAIT YOUR OPPONENT INTO LAUNCHING ANATTACK THAT YOU CAN PREDICT AND THEN COUNTER. HOLDING YOUR FRONT HAND LOW ALSOGIVES YOU MORE OFFENSIVE OPTIONS. YOU CAN MIX IT UP TO KEEP YOUR OPPONENTGUESSING. SEE FIGURES 102 AND 117. ACCORDING TO TED WONG, BRUCE USUALLY SPARREDWITH THE LEAD HAND HELD LOW:> WHEN WE SPARRED, HIS HAND WAS USUALLY DOWN. THAT’S JUST THE WAY HE SPARRED. SO> RELAXED. HE WAS FAST. BRUCE LEE IS BRUCE LEE! HE’S GOING TO BE FAST NO MATTER> WHERE HIS HAND IS. THE REASON HE HELD THE HAND DOWN, THOUGH, WAS TO DRAW YOU> IN. THE FRONT HAND DOWN IS LESS THREATENING. IT ALSO GIVES YOU MORE CHOICES.> HE SAID, “WITH THE HAND DOWN, I CAN THROW AN UPPERCUT. I CAN THROW A HOOK. IF> YOUR HAND’S UP, YOU CAN ONLY THROW FROM THAT REGION.” BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT> TO BE FAST, YOU GO TO THE GUN SIGHT PRINCIPLE. IT MAKES THE DISTANCE SHORTER.> KEEPING THE HAND DOWN ALSO MAKES YOU MORE MOBILE. YOU’RE MORE BALANCED.5[../Images/181a.jpg]FIGURE 117: VARIATION OF THE JKD STANCE WITH LOW FRONT HAND.THE NEXT TIME YOU’RE SPARRING, I SUGGEST THAT YOU TRY KEEPING YOUR HAND LOW FORA LITTLE WHILE. YOU’LL HAVE TO BE EXTRA PRECISE IN YOUR JUDGMENT OF DISTANCE TOAVOID BEING HIT. AND KEEP THAT LEFT HAND UP! BUT YOU SHOULD NOTICE (1) MUCHGREATER MOBILITY AND (2) THAT YOU HAVE SO MANY MORE OPTIONS. YOU CAN SET UP APATTERN OF HOOKING HIGH AND THEN SUDDENLY UPPERCUT FROM BELOW. OR SET UP APATTERN OF STRAIGHT LEADS AND THEN SUDDENLY HOOK. ALSO SEE IF YOUR OPPONENT ISMORE LIKELY TO ATTACK WHEN YOUR HAND IS LOW, GIVING YOU MORE OPPORTUNITIES TOATTACK BY DRAWING.AS I’LL DISCUSS IN CHAPTER ELEVEN, YOU CAN SEE THIS VARIATION OF THE STANCE INACTION IF YOU GO TO BRUCE’S FILMS.[../Images/2.jpg]N O T E S1 JACK DEMPSEY, CHAMPIONSHIP FIGHTING: EXPLOSIVE PUNCHING AND AGGRESSIVE DEFENCE(NEW YORK: PRENTICE HALL, INC., 1950), PP. 97–98. IT’S LIKELY THE TERM “PIVOTSTEP” CAME FROM DEMPSEY. HERE, HE DESCRIBES ITS USE WITH THE CORKSCREW HOOK:“YOU’LL STEP IN MOST WITH THE LEFT CORKSCREW.

IN SOME CASES,THEY HAVE TAKEN CERTAIN ARTS—SOUTHEAST ASIAN ARTS LIKE KALI AND ESCRIMA, FOREXAMPLE—AND MISREPRESENTED THEM AS JKD. THIS IS DISRESPECTFUL NOT ONLY TO BRUCELEE BUT ALSO TO MASTERS OF THESE OTHER ARTS. NOWHERE IN BRUCE LEE’S WRITINGSWILL YOU FIND NOTES ON KALI OR ESCRIMA TECHNIQUES. IN FACT, NOWHERE IN BRUCELEE’S PRIVATE NOTES WILL YOU FIND AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF ANY ARTS OTHER THANWESTERN FENCING AND BOXING, AND IN EARLIER YEARS, WING CHUN.1JKD IS NOT KALI. IT IS NOT ESCRIMA. AND IT IS MOST CERTAINLY NOT, AS SOMESO-CALLED JKD INSTRUCTORS HAVE DESCRIBED IT, A CLUTTERED MESS OF “27 ARTS.” NOPROOF FOR THIS CLAIM CAN BE FOUND IN ANY OF BRUCE LEE’S PUBLISHED OR PRIVATENOTES. IF HE ONLY BRIEFLY MENTIONED OTHER ARTS, IT WAS TO UNDERSTAND THEIRSTRENGTHS AND SHORTCOMINGS, SO THAT HE COULD FIND WAYS TO DEFEAT THEM. IN ANACTUAL FIGHT, THERE IS NO TIME TO “FLOW” IN AND OUT OF 27 DIFFERENT ARTS. THEREIS NO SUCH THING AS “JKD BLEND,” AS IT IS SOMETIMES CALLED.BASING ALL THE TECHNIQUES OF A SINGLE SYSTEM ON THE SAME PRINCIPLES OF BOXINGAND FENCING, THE LAWS OF PHYSICS, AND THE MECHANICS OF THE HUMAN BODY, IS QUITEDIFFERENT FROM HAPHAZARDLY COLLECTING TECHNIQUES FROM A DOZEN OTHER ARTS. IT ISDOUBTFUL THAT THE CREATORS OF A “STYLE” THAT BORROWS FROM SO MANY OTHER ARTSHAVE INVESTIGATED EACH TECHNIQUE SUFFICIENTLY TO PROVE THEIR SCIENTIFICVALIDITY. THEIR INSTRUCTION IS OFTEN A LONG LITANY OF, “FIRST YOU DO THIS, ANDTHEN YOU DO THIS AND THEN YOU DO THIS, AND THEN YOU DO THIS.” AND AS BRUCEHIMSELF SAID, “WHILE YOU ARE REMEMBERING ALL THE ‘ AND THENS’ THE OTHER GUY ISKILLING YOU”2 —PROBABLY WITH THE STRAIGHT LEAD. AGAIN, IN BRUCE LEE’S WRITINGS,THE ONLY TECHNIQUES GIVEN ENOUGH CONSIDERATION FOR ACTUAL APPLICATION ANDINCORPORATION INTO JKD COME FROM THE SAME THREE ARTS— FENCING, BOXING, AND,THOUGH EVENTUALLY DISCARDED, WING CHUN.[../Images/2.jpg]I T ’ S N O T W I N G C H U NJKD IS NOT A MODIFIED VERSION OF WING CHUN AS SOME HAVE MISREPRESENTED IT. ASI’VE DISCUSSED THROUGHOUT THIS BOOK, THE INADEQUACIES OF THE TRADITIONAL ARTSARE WHAT FORCED BRUCE TO ADOPT THE PRINCIPLES OF WESTERN FENCING AND BOXING INTHE FIRST PLACE. YES, HE INITIALLY STUDIED WING CHUN. AND, YES, HE WROTE ABOUTAND PRACTICED IT. BUT REMEMBER, THIS WAS EARLY IN HIS DEVELOPMENT AS A FIGHTER.AS ANYONE WHO’S SEEN BACKYARD TRAINING FOOTAGE OF BRUCE KNOWS, BY THE LATE1960S, HE’D TRADED IN HIS WING CHUN DUMMY FOR THE HEAVY BAG.IN A LETTER TO WILLIAM CHEUNG THAT WE’VE ALREADY REFERRED TO, BRUCE HAD STOPPEDPRACTICING WING CHUN BY 1967. WHILE MUCH OF BRUCE’S RESEARCH ON TRADITIONALMARTIAL ARTS IN THE EARLY 1960S HAS BEEN PUBLISHED, ANYTHING HE WROTE AFTER 1967SHOULD BE CONSIDERED JKD RESEARCH. SOME WING CHUN INSTRUCTORS LIKE TO CLAIM THATWING CHUN IS THE FOUNDATION OF JEET KUNE DO AND THAT BRUCE LEE MERELY EXPANDEDON IT. WRONG. HE HAD ALL BUT ABANDONED IT. ITS SHORTCOMINGS ARE WHAT FORCED HIMTO LOOK FOR A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY OF FIGHTING. IT’S DIFFICULT TO COMPREHENDWHERE THIS MISUNDERSTANDING ORIGINATES, BECAUSE IT IS SO CLEARLY DOCUMENTED INBRUCE LEE’S LETTER TO CHEUNG. HOW MUCH MORE CLEARLY CAN YOU SAY, AS BRUCE DOESIN THE LETTER, “I’VE LOST FAITH IN THE CHINESE CLASSICAL ARTS”? HE GOES ON TOSAY THE “REASON FOR MY NOT STICKING TO WING CHUN [IS] BECAUSE I SINCERELY FEELTHAT THIS STYLE [JKD] HAS MORE TO OFFER REGARDING EFFICIENCY.”3, 4[../Images/2.jpg]W E S T E R N S T R U C T U R ESO, FROM A TECHNICAL POINT OF VIEW, LET’S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THAT JKDEFFICIENCY. STRUCTURALLY, THE STANCE AND MECHANICS OF JKD ARE COMPLETELYDIFFERENT. AS SHOWN IN FIGURE 118, THE TRADITIONAL STANCE IS A VERY OPEN,SQUARED OFF STANCE. THE JKD STANCE, MUCH LIKE A FENCER’S STANCE IS MORE CLOSEDAND CLOSES EVEN FURTHER WHEN THE LEAD PUNCH IS THROWN, PROVIDING FURTHERPROTECTION OF THE CENTERLINE. THE OPEN STANCE, ON THE OTHER HAND, REMAINS JUSTAS OPEN AT REST AS IT DOES WHEN A PUNCH IS THROWN.THE STANCE AND MECHANICS OF THE STRAIGHT LEAD ALSO PROVIDE GREATER REACH TO YOUROPPONENT AND, IN MANY CASES, WILL ALLOW YOU TO HIT WITHOUT BEING HIT. A MOREOPEN STANCE DOES NOT ALLOW FOR HIP ROTATION AND RESTRICTS REACH. ON THE OTHERHAND, THE HIP ROTATION AND SHOULDER EXTENSION OF THE JKD STRAIGHT LEAD PUTSNON-JKD PRACTITIONERS WITHIN YOUR STRIKING RANGE. AND EVEN AGAINST OPPONENTS WHOARE MUCH TALLER WITH GREATER ARM LENGTH, YOU WILL STILL BE OUT OF THEIR REACH.[../Images/186a.jpg]FIGURE 118: AS YOU CAN SEE, THE STRUCTURE OF THE JKD STRAIGHT LEAD (RIGHT) ISENTIRELY DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE TRADITIONAL, OPEN-STANCE PUNCH (LEFT). EVENTHOUGH YOUR OPPONENT MAY HAVE A GREATER WINGSPAN, THE STRUCTURE OF THE JKDSTANCE AND THE MECHANICS OF THE PUNCH MAY STILL ALLOW YOU TO REACH YOUR OPPONENTWHILE HE OR SHE IS UNABLE TO REACH YOU.[../Images/2.jpg]F O O T W O R KPERHAPS THE MOST GLARING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JKD AND WING CHUN IS IN THE FOOTWORKOF EACH SYSTEM. WING CHUN IS ALMOST PURELY LINEAR IN ITS MOVEMENT. THERE’SFORWARD AND BACK, TURN TO THE LEFT, TURN TO THE RIGHT. THAT’S IT. ON THE OTHERHAND, AS DISCUSSED EARLIER, JKD HAS THE PIVOTING, CURVING STEP THAT ALLOWS AFIGHTER TO COVER DISTANCE AND CHANGE ANGLES SIMULTANEOUSLY. THIS OPENS UP AVASTLY GREATER RANGE OF ANGLES, MUCH LIKE THOSE EMPLOYED BY BOXERS AT CLOSERANGE.5TIMING-WISE, WING CHUN IS, LIKE MOST EASTERN ARTS, A WHOLE-BEAT ART. THEFOOTWORK DOES NOT ALLOW FOR DIRECTION CHANGE OR OTHER MOVEMENT ON THE HALF-BEAT.WITH ITS HEAVY FENCING INFLUENCE, JKD, ON THE OTHER HAND, ALLOWS FOR ATTACK OREVASION AT ANY TIME. WE’VE ONLY TOUCHED ON THE FOOTWORK POSSIBILITIES IN THISVOLUME. AGAIN, THE FOOTWORK THAT IS THE FOUNDATION OF JKD COULD BE THE SUBJECTOF AN ENTIRE BOOK ITSELF. SUFFICE TO SAY THAT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIRE A SHOTAT ANY TIME—WHOLE BEAT OR HALF-BEAT—FROM ANY ANGLE, NO MATTER WHERE YOUR WEIGHTIS DISTRIBUTED—ON THE FRONT FOOT, THE BACK FOOT, IN THE AIR. TRUE JUN FAN JEETKUNE DO FOOTWORK ALLOWS FOR THIS.[../Images/2.jpg]I T ’ S N O T B O X I N GWHILE BRUCE MAY HAVE DISCARDED WING CHUN FOR THE WESTERN ARTS OF FENCING ANDBOXING, JEET KUNE DO IS NOT A SIMPLIFIED VERSION OF THOSE ARTS EITHER. TO THEUNTRAINED EYE, IT MAY APPEAR AS THOUGH JEET KUNE DO IS NOTHING MORE THAN A FANCYNAME FOR BOXING OR KICKBOXING. THIS IS A COMMON MISCONCEPTION NOT HELPED BY THEFACT THAT, FOR YEARS, CERTAIN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TEACHING WHAT IS ESSENTIALLYBOXING AND PASSING IT OFF AS JKD. SO, LET’S REVIEW A FEW POINTS TO CLARIFY.[../Images/2.jpg]S T R O N G S I D E F O R W A R DALTHOUGH BRUCE TOOK MANY OF THE TECHNICAL NUANCES OF THE STRAIGHT LEAD FROMDEMPSEY AND DRISCOLL, REMEMBER THAT IN JKD, WE PLACE THE STRONG HAND (THE RIGHTHAND FOR MOST PEOPLE) IN FRONT. THE STANCE IS CONSTRUCTED FOR OPTIMAL DELIVERYOF THE LEAD PUNCH. THE SET UP FOR BOXING IS THE REVERSE. THE BOXING STANCE ISCONSTRUCTED AROUND DELIVERY OF THE REAR HAND. WHILE THE LEFT JAB IS USED TO SETUP THE RIGHT CROSS IN BOXING, THE BOXING STANCE IS DESIGNED FOR OPTIMAL DELIVERYOF THE REAR HAND.WHEN TUTTLE PUBLISHING RELEASED ITS VOLUMES OF THE BRUCE LEE LIBRARY IN THE LATE1990S, THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF CONFUSION. STUDENTS LEARNING FROM SUPPOSED JKDPRACTITIONERS HAD BEEN TAUGHT TO FIGHT IN BOXING STANCES WITH THE LEFT, ORWEAKER SIDE, IN FRONT. WHAT THEY WERE READING IN BRUCE LEE’S OWN WORDS WASCONTRADICTORY. A WHOLE LOT OF HEAD SCRATCHING AND BACKPEDALING FOLLOWED.JUST A SIDE NOTE HERE—IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A JEET KUNE DO INSTRUCTOR, THEREARE CERTAIN FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS THAT MUST BE IN PLACE. CHIEF AMONG THESEELEMENTS IS THAT THE STRONG HAND BE IN FRONT. EVEN IF THE INSTRUCTOR KNOWSNOTHING ELSE, ANY JKD PRACTITIONER SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE THE STRONG HAND AS THELEAD. IF THE INSTRUCTOR DOESN’T KNOW THIS, HE OR SHE IS NOT ONLY UNFAMILIAR WITHTHE MOST BASIC ASPECTS OF JKD BUT ALSO OBVIOUSLY HASN’T EVEN BOTHERED TO READBRUCE LEE.[../Images/2.jpg]T H E S T A N C ETHE LONG-RANGE JKD STANCE FROM WHICH YOU WILL DELIVER THE STRAIGHT LEAD IS ALSODIFFERENT FROM BOXING IN ITS FOOT PLACEMENT. IN AN ORTHODOX BOXING STANCE, EVENTHOUGH ONE FOOT IS STILL IN FRONT OF THE OTHER, YOUR SHOULDERS ARE SQUARED OFFTO YOUR OPPONENT. EVEN IN THE MORE MODERN BOXING STANCE, YOU ARE STILL MORESQUARED OFF THAN IN THE JKD ON-GUARD. IN THE MODERN BOXING STANCE YOUR FRONT TOEIS ALIGNED WITH THE HEEL OF YOUR REAR FOOT. REMEMBER IN THE JKD STANCE, YOURFRONT TOE IS ALIGNED WITH THE ARCH OF YOUR REAR FOOT.THIS DIFFERENCE SERVES TO NARROW YOUR TARGET AREA. IT IS MUCH MORE OF A FENCER’SSTANCE. WHEN YOU GO TO DELIVER THE STRAIGHT LEAD, THE AREA YOU REVEAL TO YOUROPPONENT AS A TARGET ACTUALLY DIMINISHES. YOU ARE BOTH MORE DEFENSIVE ANDOFFENSIVE AT THE SAME TIME. IN BOXING, ON THE OTHER HAND, NOTHING CHANGES AS YOUTHROW THE FRONT HAND, BECAUSE THE BOXING JAB DOES NOT HAVE FOOT PLACEMENT THATALLOWS FOR THAT EXTRA TURN OF THE HIP THAT WOULD MAKE YOU A NARROWER TARGET. ATTHE END OF THE BOXING JAB, YOU REMAIN FACING YOUR OPPONENT AS SQUARELY AS WHENYOU STARTED.REMEMBER FROM OUR EXPERIMENT AT THE END OF THE STANCE CHAPTER THAT THE ALIGNMENTOF THE JKD LEAD PUNCH WAS DESIGNED TO BEST ABSORB IMPACT OF THE EQUAL ANDOPPOSITE FORCE EXERTED BY THE TARGET. ALSO REMEMBER FROM THIS EXPERIMENT THATTHE BOXING JAB WAS NOT AS EFFECTIVE IN ABSORBING THOSE FORCES.THERE ARE TIMES, OF COURSE, WHEN YOU WILL HAVE TO ENGAGE IN INFIGHTING THAT WILLREQUIRE YOU TO SQUARE OFF A BIT MORE TO ALLOW FOR BETTER LEVERAGE AT CLOSERANGE. AND AT THIS RANGE, YOU WILL CEASE TO THROW PURE STRAIGHT LEADS.BUT THE WHOLE IDEA OF BEING ABLE TO THROW THE JKD LEAD IS THAT IT GIVES YOUADDED RANGE. IN A FIGHT, YOU WANT TO HIT AND NOT GET HIT. STRAIGHT PUNCHINGMAKES THIS POSSIBLE.[../Images/2.jpg]T H U M B S U PTRUE, YOU MIGHT CALL THIS ELEMENT OF THE STRAIGHT LEAD A VESTIGE OF OLD TIMEYBOXING. BRUCE DREW FROM THE BOXING LITERATURE BEFORE HIS TIME. DEMPSEY,DRISCOLL, AND HAISLET ALL THREW THEIR LEAD HANDS THUMBS UP. RECALL THE REASONFOR THIS IS WHAT DEMPSEY CALLED THE POWER LINE. IT IS A MUCH MORE STABLE PUNCHTHAT SENDS MORE FORCE IN YOUR OPPONENT’S DIRECTION AND PUTS YOU AT LESS RISK FORHAND AND WRIST INJURIES. WHILE THIS JKD ELEMENT COMES FROMEARLY-TWENTIETH-CENTURY BOXING, IT IS SOMETHING YOU ALMOST NEVER SEE TODAY.[../Images/2.jpg]G R E A T E R R A N G EPART OF WHAT GIVES THE JEET KUNE DO LEAD A UNIQUE ADVANTAGE OVER OTHER ARTS ISTHAT IT AFFORDS CRUCIAL INCHES OF ADDITIONAL STRIKING RANGE. AS YOU CAN SEE FROMFIGURE 119, THE STRUCTURE OF THE STANCE AND THE HIP-TURN MECHANICS ENABLE YOU TOCOVER PRECIOUS EXTRA DISTANCE. THIS IS WHAT DRISCOLL MEANT WHEN HE TITLED ONE OFHIS BOXING TEXTBOOKS OUTFIGHTING OR LONG RANGE BOXING.6 HOW REASSURING IT IS TOKNOW THAT AGAINST A NON-JKD PRACTITIONER, OR AN INCORRECTLY TRAINED ONE, THATYOU CAN HIT AT WILL WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT BEING HIT YOURSELF?.[../Images/189a.jpg]FIGURE 119: THE STANCE AND MECHANICS OF THE JKD STRAIGHT LEAD ALLOW FOR GREATERRANGE THAN THE STANCE AND MECHANICS OF THE BOXING JAB. EVEN WITH MY SHORTERWINGSPAN, I AM STILL ABLE TO REACH MY OPPONENT WITH THE JKD LEAD, WHILE HE ISUNABLE TO REACH ME WITH A BOXING JAB.[../Images/2.jpg]T H E F E N C I N G C O N N E C T I O NJEET KUNE DO MAY LOOK A BIT LIKE BOXING SIMPLY BECAUSE WE THROW PUNCHES AND WEARBOXING GEAR WHEN WE SPAR, BUT OF THE TWO WESTERN INFLUENCES ON JKD, FENCING ISACTUALLY THE MORE PREVALENT. IT IS MOST LIKELY THAT BRUCE LEE FIRST RESEARCHEDBOXING LITERATURE FROM EARLIER DECADES WHEN IT SEEMED TO BE COMMON KNOWLEDGETHAT ENGLISH BOXING HAD EVOLVED OUT OF FENCING. AS WE’VE SEEN, BOTH HAISLET ANDDRISCOLL DREW MANY PARALLELS TO FENCING—THE STRAIGHT THRUST, THE STOP-HIT, THEFIGHTING MEASURE.7IT IS FROM THIS BOXING LITERATURE, THAT BRUCE PROBABLY GOT THE IDEA TO DELVEINTO FENCING AND THE WORK OF NADI, CASTELLO, MARTINEZ, AND CROSNIER.8 SO MANY OFTHE STRATEGIC VARIABLES IN JKD COME FROM FENCING. CADENCE, BROKEN RHYTHM, THEFENCING MEASURE. THE NAME “JEET KUNE DO” ITSELF, IS ESSENTIALLY ANOTHER WAY OFSAYING “STOP-HIT.”SO, IF ANYONE TELLS YOU JKD IS MERELY BOXING, CORRECT HIM OR HER AND EXPLAINTHAT IT IS REALLY FENCING. OR AS BRUCE SAID, “IT IS WESTERN SWORDFENCING—WITHOUT THE SWORD.”9[../Images/2.jpg]E V I D E N C E O N F I L MAS I’LL DISCUSS IN THE NEXT CHAPTER, THE EASIEST WAY TO SETTLE THESE ISSUES ISTO SEE FOR YOURSELF. WATCH BRUCE ON FILM—EITHER IN HIS THEATRICAL RELEASES ORPRIVATE TRAINING AND SPARRING FOOTAGE—AND YOU’LL SEE THAT UNLIKE BOXERS, HEPLACES THE STRONG SIDE, HIS RIGHT SIDE, IN FRONT. WHEN HE THROWS A STRAIGHTLEAD, IT’S WITH THE THUMB UP, NOT PALM DOWN. LOOK AT HIS STANCE. HAVE YOU EVERSEEN BRUCE IN A CLOSED WING CHUN STANCE LIKE THAT? NO, A WING CHUN STANCE ISOPEN AND SQUARED OFF. LOOK AT BRUCE’S FOOTWORK. DO YOU SEE WING CHUNPRACTITIONERS WITH THE SAME BOUNCE AND SPRING OF BOXERS AND FENCERS? OF COURSE,NOT. IN SPARRING FOOTAGE ESPECIALLY, DO YOU SEE BRUCE “FLOWING” IN AND OUT OFDIFFERENT STYLES? NO, HE’S MOSTLY THROWING STRAIGHT LEADS, STOP-HITS, ANDFRONT-LEG KICKS. THAT’S IT. IT’S A FEW SIMPLE TECHNIQUES APPLIED TO PERFECTIONWITH REGARD TO MECHANICS, TIMING, AND DISTANCE.10 I’VE LAID OUT THE PUBLISHEDEVIDENCE FOR YOU HERE, BUT AS ALWAYS, THE BEST EVIDENCE IS BRUCE HIMSELF.[../Images/2.jpg]N O T E S1 YOU WILL NOT FIND A SINGLE MENTION OF KALI OR ESCRIMA IN ANY OF BRUCE LEE’SPUBLISHED NOTES.

EVERYTHING PRESENTED INTHIS BOOK HAS ITS ORIGINS IN BRUCE’S WRITINGS—AND THEIR ORIGINAL SOURCES—AS WELLAS INSTRUCTION FROM TED WONG, WHO HAS SHARED MUCH OF THE FIRSTHAND INSTRUCTIONHE RECEIVED FROM BRUCE.OVER THE YEARS, CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS HAVE USED THE NAME JEET KUNE DO TO PROMOTETHEMSELVES, OTHER ARTS, AND TECHNIQUES THAT HAVE NO FOUNDATION IN BRUCE LEE’SWORK—OR BASIC LAWS OF SCIENCE, FOR THAT MATTER. TO MAKE THINGS EASY, THOUGH,IT’S NOT A MATTER OF “HE SAID, SHE SAID.” IT’S A MATTER OF SCIENCE. I HOPE THATTHE ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THIS BOOK HAVE AT LEAST SHED SOME LIGHT ON WHY BRUCELEE MADE THE TECHNICAL CHOICES THAT HE DID. AGAIN, HE DIDN’T THROW JUST ANYTHINGINTO THE MIX. AFTER YEARS OF RESEARCHING FIGHTING SCIENCE, HE CHOSE THETHUMBS-UP, STRONG-SIDE-FORWARD LEAD PUNCH. HE DIDN’T THROW IN THE LEFT-HANDED,PALM-DOWN BOXING JAB, TOO, JUST BECAUSE HE COULD. HE MADE A CONSCIOUS CHOICE TOINCLUDE CERTAIN ELEMENTS, TO THE EXCLUSION OF OTHERS. THESE ARE SCIENTIFICALLYBASED CHOICES.IF PEOPLE CHOOSE TO ADD TO THEIR MARTIAL ARTS REPERTOIRE, FINE. IF THEIRADDITIONS ARE TRUE IMPROVEMENTS, EVEN BETTER. BUT THEY SHOULD NOT MISREPRESENTTHOSE ELEMENTS AS JEET KUNE DO. OTHERWISE, IT BECOMES IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW WHATELEMENTS TRULY CAME FROM BRUCE LEE. AND IF THOSE ADDED, NON-JKD ELEMENTS HAVEPROVEN TO BE SO EFFECTIVE, WHY NOT TAKE CREDIT FOR IT? WHY HIDE UNDER THE NAMEOF JEET KUNE DO? THOSE WHO HAVE PRACTICED OTHER DISCIPLINES OR THEIR OWNINVENTIONS BUT CALLED IT JEET KUNE DO ALL THESE YEARS HAVE SLOWLY ERODED BRUCELEE’S ART. IT’S TIME TO RECLAIM IT.THIS WILL TAKE SOME TIME, BECAUSE THERE’S A LOT OF STUFF OUT THERE MASQUERADINGAS JEET KUNE DO. THERE’S AN EASY WAY AROUND THIS, THOUGH, AND ALL IT TAKES IS ALITTLE COMMON SENSE. GO TO THE SOURCE.[../Images/2.jpg]S E E B R U C E M O V ETHERE ARE LIMITATIONS TO THE WRITTEN WORD AND STILL PICTURES. I COULD TALK ATYOU ALL DAY, BUT A BOOK ALONE IS NOT GOING TO GET YOU A PERFECT STRAIGHT LEAD. ICAN DESCRIBE SOME THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT ON YOUR OWNFROM OBSERVATION, AND SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATIONS SHOULD INCREASE YOUR UNDERSTANDINGOF WHAT’S HAPPENING—AND, MORE IMPORTANT, WHY — WHEN YOU THROW THE LEAD PUNCH.BUT AS BRUCE SAID, “THE ESSENCE OF FIGHTING IS THE ART OF MOVING.”1 YOU’VE GOTTO KNOW WHAT THE LEAD PUNCH LOOKS LIKE IN MOTION.THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO WHEN TRYING TO DIFFERENTIATE THE IMPOSTERS FROM THEREAL THING IS TO WATCH THE REAL THING. WATCH BRUCE. SO, LET’S GO OVER SOMEACCESSIBLE EXAMPLES OF BRUCE ON FILM DEMONSTRATING THE STRAIGHT LEAD. ONE WORDOF CAUTION BEFORE WE GET STARTED: THE MAN WAS FAST! I RECOMMEND TAKING THEREMOTE TO YOUR DVD PLAYER AND WATCHING THESE SCENES FRAME BY FRAME TO FULLYAPPRECIATE BRUCE’S ARTISTRY. I’VE INCLUDED THE TIMES AT WHICH THESE SCENESOCCUR, BUT BE AWARE THAT AS DVDS ARE REISSUED OR RELEASED IN OTHER COUNTRIES,THE TIME CODES VARY SLIGHTLY.[../Images/2.jpg]B R U C E L E E: A W A R R I O R ’ S J O U R N E Y1 - I N C H P U N C HBASED ON WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE STRAIGHT LEAD AND JEET KUNE DO’S UNDERLYINGTHEMES OF EFFICIENCY AND ECONOMY OF MOTION, IT’S NOT SURPRISING THAT SOME OF THEBEST VISUAL EXAMPLES CAN BE FOUND, NOT IN BRUCE LEE’S FILMS, BUT IN THEDOCUMENTARY BRUCE LEE: A WARRIOR’S JOURNEY. THE FEW SECONDS OF HOME ANDDEMONSTRATION FOOTAGE GIVE US AN IDEA OF WHAT JKD LOOKS LIKE IN A FORM LESSSTAGED FOR FILM.AT 29 MINUTES AND 35 SECONDS INTO THE DVD, YOU’LL SEE BRUCE DEMONSTRATE HISFAMOUS 1-INCH PUNCH AT THE 1967 INTERNATIONAL KARATE TOURNAMENT. WHILE IT IS NOTEXACTLY THE STANDARD LEAD PUNCH WE HAVE DISCUSSED THROUGHOUT MUCH OF THIS BOOK,THE 1-INCH PUNCH IS THE STRAIGHT IN MICROCOSM, ESSENTIALLY THE STRAIGHT LEAD ATTHE POINT OF IMPACT. IT DEMONSTRATES HOW CONSTRUCTION OF THE STANCE AND PROPERMECHANICS GIVE US MAXIMUM LEVERAGE AND FORCE PRODUCTION AT THE POINT OF IMPACTWITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF WIND-UP OR MOMENTUM.THE HAND IS POSITIONED 1 INCH AWAY FROM THE TARGET. NOTICE HOW BRUCE’S ARM ISBENT JUST ENOUGH TO ALLOW FOR ABOUT 3 INCHES TO PUNCH THROUGH THE TARGET.REMEMBER, THIS IS WHERE A PUSHING MOTION WOULD HAVE THE GREATEST LEVERAGE. BRUCEGOES THROUGH THE MOTIONS OF HIP ROTATION. PRIOR TO THE ACTUAL PUNCH, YOU’LL SEEHIM HUNKER DOWN A LITTLE, GIVING HIM THE “SMALL PHASIC BENT KNEE” DISCUSSEDEARLIER. AGAIN, THAT BENT KNEE GIVES HIM ROOM FROM WHICH TO PUSH. IF HIS LEGSWERE ALREADY STRAIGHTENED, HE’D HAVE NOWHERE LEFT TO GO, AND BECAUSE HE IS NOTCOVERING ANY DISTANCE WITH HIS FEET, HE’LL NEED THE EXTRA VERTICAL FORCE, ORGROUND REACTION FORCE, TO GENERATE POWER. THE POSITION OF HIS LEGS AND FEET JUSTPRIOR TO DELIVERING THE PUNCH IS EXACTLY WHERE YOURS WOULD BE BEFORE PUSHING OFFFOR A REGULAR STRAIGHT LEAD.YOU PROBABLY WOULDN’T EXPECT TOO MUCH FOOTWORK FROM A PUNCH DELIVERED FROM ONLY1 INCH AWAY, BUT LOOK CLOSELY. AS HE SETTLES DOWN BEFORE STRIKING, YOU’LL SEEHIS LEFT HEEL COME UP. AS HIS HIPS ROTATE, YOU’LL SEE HIM TRANSFER HIS WEIGHT,CHANGING FROM A 50-50 DISTRIBUTION ON BOTH FEET TO PLACING MORE OF HIS WEIGHT INTHE FRONT LEG. THE LEFT FOOT PUSHES OFF THE GROUND. HIS FIST HITS THE TARGET.THE RIGHT FOOT READJUSTS, COMING SLIGHTLY OFF THE GROUND TO ACCOMMODATE FOR THEWEIGHT TRANSFER. THE REAR FOOT LANDS. VOILÀ. A PUSH-OFF AND THREE-POINT LANDING,ALL IN PLACE. THE LESSON HERE IS THAT EVERY PUNCH IN JEET KUNE DO REQUIRESFOOTWORK, EVEN IF YOU’RE NOT COVERING DISTANCE.ALSO NOTICE THAT BRUCE’S CENTER OF GRAVITY NEVER OVERTAKES HIS FRONT LEG. EVENTHOUGH HE IS TRANSFERRING HIS WEIGHT FORWARD TO THE FRONT FOOT, HIS CENTER OFGRAVITY NEVER FALLS OUTSIDE THE BASE DETERMINED BY HIS FOOT POSITION. THIS ISHOW BALANCE IS MAINTAINED.THE STRAIGHT BLASTAT THE 29 MINUTE AND 8 SECOND MARK, YOU’LL FIND A VARIATION OF THE STRAIGHT LEADIN THE STRAIGHT BLAST, WHICH IS A SUCCESSION OF STRAIGHT RIGHT AND LEFT HANDBLOWS. IN THIS CASE, BRUCE IS THROWING A STRAIGHT BLAST AT THE HEAVY BAG. THEPUNCH IS DELIVERED FROM A LOW LINE, MAKING IT VERY CLOSE TO BEING A SHOVEL HOOK.WHAT I WANT YOU TO NOTICE IN THIS EXAMPLE IS THE WEIGHT TRANSFER. ALL THREEDIRECTIONS OF FORCE ARE ACCOUNTED FOR HERE. THERE IS ROTATION AT THE HIPS. WITHEACH PUNCH, HE IS ALSO PUSHING OFF WITH TREMENDOUS GROUND REACTION FORCE.FINALLY, HE IS SENDING HIS WEIGHT TOWARD THE BAG BY HITTING THROUGH IT.RESOURCESAT 20 MIN 13 SEC, WE GET A PEEK AT BRUCE’S OWN COPIES OF ROGER CROSNIER ANDEDWIN HAISLET’S BOOKS, WITH BRUCE’S METICULOUS NOTES WRITTEN IN THEM. AND AT 31MINUTES AND 8 SECONDS, WE SEE THE FIRESIDE BOOK OF BOXING, WHICH AS YOU MAYRECALL CONTAINS AN EXCERPT FROM CAPTAIN GODFREY’S BOOK, THE FIRST PUBLICATION TOCREDIT FENCING FOR THE RESURGENCE OF BRITISH BOXING.THE STOP -HITI’VE SAVED THE BEST FOR LAST. TWO PERFECT EXAMPLES OF THE STRAIGHT LEAD APPLIEDTO A COMBATIVE SITUATION. THE FIRST CAN BE SEEN AT THE 21 MINUTES AND 16 SECONDSMARK. IT’S THE 1967 INTERNATIONAL KARATE TOURNAMENT, AND BRUCE IS SPARRING.FIRST, NOTICE HOW INCREDIBLY RELAXED BRUCE IS AND THE VARIATION IN POSITION OFHIS LEAD HAND. MOST OF THE TIME IT IS LEFT DOWN AT HIS SIDE. IN THIS FIRSTEXAMPLE, AS HIS OPPONENT RUSHES IN ON HIM, BRUCE USES TWO OF THE SIMPLEST FORMSOF OFFENSIVE DEFENSE. FIRST, HE THROWS OUT A FRONT LEG OBSTRUCTION TO COUNTER AKICK, AND THEN HE SHOOTS A STRAIGHT LEAD TO HIS OPPONENT’S HEAD.2 THE TIMING ANDDISTANCE HAD TO BE PERFECT TO PULL OFF THESE COUNTERS.THIS IS ABOUT AS SIMPLE AND UTTERLY UNGLAMOROUS AS IT GETS. THERE IS ABSOLUTELYNOTHING FLASHY ABOUT THESE COUNTERS. AS SOON AS HIS OPPONENT SO MUCH ASTWITCHES, HE’S THROWN OUT THAT LEAD HAND AS STRAIGHT AS CAN BE. IF YOU BLINK,YOU’LL MISS IT. COMPARE THIS TO THE MORE EXAGGERATED AND BUSIER MOVEMENTS OFBRUCE IN HIS FILMS. THIS IS ONE I REALLY SUGGEST YOU FREEZE AND THEN WATCH FRAMEBY FRAME.A FEW SECONDS LATER AT THE 21 MINUTES AND 23 SECONDS POINT, WE GET ANOTHER GREATEXAMPLE OF THE STOP-HIT. BEFORE HIS OPPONENT CAN EVEN GET HIS KICK OFF THEGROUND, BAM! BRUCE HAS ALREADY POPPED HIM WITH THE STRAIGHT LEAD. REMEMBER, THEHAND AND ARM WILL ALWAYS MOVE FASTER THAN THE FOOT AND LEG.THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF FOOTWORK. BRUCE USES THE STEP ANDSLIDE, AND SMALL, CONTROLLED PUSH-OFFS TO MAINTAIN THE FIGHTING MEASURE. HEBACKS UP ONCE WITH A STEP AND SLIDE—ONE WHOLE BEAT. THIS SETS HIS OPPONENT UPFOR WHAT FOLLOWS. BRUCE COMPLETES THE FIRST HALF OF ANOTHER STEP BACKWARD, BUTON THE HALF-BEAT, HE REVERSES DIRECTION AND TAGS HIS OPPONENT AGAIN. SO, HERE WEHAVE THE MAINTENANCE OF DISTANCE, TIMING, AND THE SET UP ALL ACHIEVED THROUGHFOOTWORK.JUST AS DRISCOLL OBSERVED WITH MOST STRAIGHT LEADS, IT DOESN’T EVEN SEEM AS IFBRUCE THROWS A VERY HARD PUNCH HERE. HE DOESN’T NEED TO. HIS OPPONENT’S OWNWEIGHT AND MOMENTUM WORKS AGAINST HIM ONCE HE RUNS INTO THE STOP-HIT. ACORRECTLY TIMED STOP-HIT SHOULD BE ALMOST EFFORTLESS.AGAIN, PRETTY SIMPLE STUFF. BRUCE’S OPPONENT MAY NEVER HAVE SEEN THE PUNCHCOMING, AND IT ALL HAPPENS SO QUICKLY ON FILM. HAVE THAT REMOTE READY FORFRAME-BY-FRAME VIEWING. PERHAPS THIS IS WHY WE DON’T HAVE A TEXTBOOK EXAMPLE OFTHE PURE STRAIGHT LEAD IN A BRUCE LEE FILM. IT’S NOT THE EASIEST THING FOR THEUNTRAINED EYE TO PERCEIVE. IN FILM, YOU WANT THE AUDIENCE TO SEE THE ACTION. INA REAL FIGHT, YOU WANT YOUR OPPONENT NEVER TO KNOW WHAT HIT HIM.E N T E R T H E D R A G O NBACKFIST VARIATIONTHE MARTIAL ARTS IN ENTER THE DRAGON ARE QUITE A BIT MORE THEATRICAL THAN WHATBRUCE WOULD USE FOR SPARRING, OR WHAT I’D CALL BACKYARD JKD, BUT THERE ARE STILLA COUPLE OF REALLY GOOD EXAMPLES HERE. BRUCE FACES OFF IN THE TOURNAMENT WITHBOB WALL. THIS SCENE APPEARS AT 61 MINUTES AND 35 SECONDS INTO THE FILM.THE PUNCH REALLY IS TOO FAST TO SEE, LET ALONE FULLY APPRECIATE. SLOW IT DOWNAND YOU’LL SEE THE MECHANICS THAT MAKE IT SO INCREDIBLY FAST. FIRST, THIS IS ABACKFIST, NOT A PURE STRAIGHT LEAD. REMEMBER, THE BACKFIST, THOUGH LACKING THEPOWER OF A STANDARD STRAIGHT, IS THE FASTEST PUNCH IN JKD. AND SOME OF THAT LOSTPOWER CAN BE COMPENSATED FOR BY SPEED BECAUSE FORCE EQUALS MASS TIMESACCELERATION. AS A BACKFIST, THE HAND STARTS TO THE LEFT (BRUCE’S LEFT) OF THECENTER LINE, WHIPS OUT, AND THEN RETURNS TO THE LEFT OF THE CENTER LINE. AND IFYOU REALLY LOOK CLOSELY, YOU’LL SEE WHAT HE’S ACTUALLY THROWING IS A FINGER JAB.ASIDE FROM THE TRAJECTORY OF THE HAND, THOUGH, EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT THIS PUNCHIS EXACTLY THE SAME AS IT WOULD BE FOR A PURE STRAIGHT LEAD. THE HAND MOVES EVERSO SLIGHTLY BEFORE THE FEET. WHAT FOLLOWS IS A BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLE OF THE PUSH-OFFAND THE THREE-POINT LANDING. BRUCE LAUNCHES OFF THE LEFT LEG. HE SMACKS BOBWALL’S FACE. THAT’S LANDING NUMBER ONE. THE RIGHT FOOT LANDS ON THE GROUND.THAT’S TWO. THE LEFT FOOT HITS THE GROUND. THREE. AS WE’VE LEARNED FROM DEMPSEY,YOU REDIRECT THE DOWNWARD GRAVITATIONAL FORCE OF YOUR BODY HURTLING TOWARD THEGROUND BY HITTING THE TARGET BEFORE THE FRONT FOOT LANDS. THAT WAY, MOST OF YOURBODY WEIGHT GOES TOWARD THE TARGET AND NOT INTO THE GROUND.THE SECOND EXAMPLE OCCURS AT 61 MINUTES AND 50 SECONDS, GIVING US ANOTHER ANGLE,A DIFFERENT LOOK, AT THE SAME PUNCH.I’D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THE TEXTBOOK ILLUSTRATION OF THE PUSH-OFF HERE, ESPECIALLYIN THE FIRST EXAMPLE. NOTE THE DEPTH, POWER, AND INCREDIBLE EXPLOSIVENESS. IDON’T KNOW IF BRUCE WAS TRYING TO MAKE A STATEMENT HERE, BUT BY PLACING THE TWOCHARACTERS IN A WING CHUN SET UP WITH THEIR TWO FOREARMS TOUCHING, HE CERTAINLYSHOWED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A JKD STRAIGHT PUNCH OVER TRADITIONAL ARTS. NO OTHERART HAS A PUNCH LIKE THIS, AND THE FOOTWORK, ITS SHEER POWER AND SPEED, IS WHATSETS THE JKD STRAIGHT LEAD APART.THE SET UPIN HIS FINAL SHOWDOWN WITH HAN (SHIH KIEN) AT THE 93 MINUTES AND 27 SECONDSMARK, THERE’S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW TO USE THE LEAD HAND FOR SET UPS. HAVINGALREADY BEEN PEPPERED BY BRUCE’S LEAD KICKS, HAN IS RIPE FOR FLINCHING. BRUCEFEINTS HIGH WITH THE LEAD HAND, THEN FAKES LOW, AGAIN WITH THE FRONT HAND. HAN,POOR SAP, FALLS FOR BOTH, LEAVING HIM A SITTING DUCK FOR GETTING A SIDEKICK INTHE EAR. AND THEN BRUCE REALLY GETS MAD. WRRRAAAAAAGH!R E T U R N O F T H E D R A G O NACCORDING TO TED WONG, RETURN OF THE DRAGON HAS MORE JKD ELEMENTS THAN ANY OTHERBRUCE LEE FILM:> OH, HE WAS VERY EXCITED BECAUSE THAT WAS THE MOVIE THAT HE WAS REALLY PROUD> OF. HE HAD WRITTEN IT, HE HAD DIRECTED IT, AND HE WAS THE STAR OF IT. IT WAS> HIS BABY. I THINK THAT MOVIE HAD MORE JKD IN IT THAN ANY OTHER MOVIE HE DID.> IT REALLY REPRESENTED HIS THINKING, HIS WAY OF MARTIAL ART.3THE FINAL SHOWDOWN IN THIS FILM WITH CHUCK NORRIS IN THE COLISEUM DOES HAVE ITALL—FOOT-WORK, STOP-HITS, SETUP’S, BROKEN RHYTHM, YOU NAME IT. LET’S START WITHTHE FOOTWORK. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FIGHT (83 MINUTES AND 30 SECONDS INTO THEFILM),4 BRUCE AVOIDS CHUCK’S KICK WITH A PENDULUM STEP. THEN AT 84 MINUTES AND51 SECONDS, THERE’S A FANTASTIC SLOW-MO SEQUENCE. YOU’LL SEE BRUCE PIVOTING,CIRCLING, CIRCLING LEFT. NOTICE THE SMALL STEPS. THEN AT 85 MINUTES AND 3SECONDS, HE PIVOTS RIGHT. WE’VE ONLY TOUCHED ON THE MOST BASIC FOOTWORK IN THISBOOK, BUT NOTICE THE PIVOTING WITH THE BOUNCING AND HALF-BEAT FOOTWORK. ALL OFTHIS KEEPS BRUCE MOBILE, ALWAYS IN BALANCE, AND READY TO SEIZE ANY STRIKINGOPPORTUNITY. THERE ARE ALSO GREAT EXAMPLES OF COORDINATION BETWEEN THE UPPER ANDLOWER BODY. AGAIN, BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THIS BOOK, BUT THESE ARE GREAT DEFENSIVEMOVES.HOWEVER GREAT THESE EXAMPLES ARE, THOUGH, YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEENTHIS STAGED FIGHT AND THE FOOTAGE OF BRUCE ACTUALLY SPARRING IN BRUCE LEE: AWARRIOR’S JOURNEY. AS TED WONG NOTES, WHEN SPARRING, BRUCE WAS ACTUALLY QUITESTILL. HE DIDN’T BOUNCE AROUND NEARLY AS MUCH AS HE DOES IN THIS FILM AND ONLYDID SO WHEN THE SITUATION CALLED FOR IT.5MOVING ON, LET’S LOOK AT AN EXAMPLE OF THE STRAIGHT AS A COUNTERATTACK. CHUCKTHROWS A PUNCH. BRUCE SLIPS AND PARRIES. CHUCK THROWS ANOTHER PUNCH. BRUCE PULLSBACK AND THEN ON THE HALF-BEAT, REVERSES DIRECTION AND COUNTERS WITH A STRAIGHTLEAD. IT’S A SHAME THAT YOU CAN’T SEE BRUCE’S FEET IN THIS SHOT. HIS HAND, ASUSUAL, IS HELD LOW AND AS RELAXED AS CAN BE BEFORE WHIPPING OUT A GREASEDLIGHTNING STRAIGHT.THIS ENTIRE FIGHT AT THE END OF RETURN OF THE DRAGON CERTAINLY IS THE BEST MOVIEREPRESENTATION OF JEET KUNE DO TACTICS. WE’RE ONLY GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW THEYRELATE TO THE STRAIGHT LEAD, BUT KNOW THERE’S A HECKUVA LOT GOING ON HERE WITHKICKS AND OTHER WEAPONS AS WELL. AT 86 MINUTES AND 27 SECONDS, WE HAVE AFANTASTIC EXAMPLE OF A SET UP USING THE STRAIGHT LEAD. HAVING ALREADYESTABLISHED THE THREAT OF THE LEAD HAND IN THE COUNTERATTACK EXAMPLE JUSTDISCUSSED, BRUCE IS FREE TO USE THE STRAIGHT PUNCH FOR PROGRESSIVE INDIRECTATTACKS. HE FEINTS HIGH. CHUCK’S CHARACTER FLAILS HIGH. BRUCE THEN GOES LOW. AT86 MINUTES AND 33 SECONDS, BRUCE REPEATS THE SAME SCENARIO. HE FEINTS HIGH, THENFAKES LOW. HE’S ESTABLISHING A PATTERN, ATTEMPTING TO LULL CHUCK INTO AMOTOR-SET MODE. NOTICE THAT IN BOTH INSTANCES, BRUCE HAS HIS HAND LOW. THEFEINTS AND FAKES START WITH HIS HAND IN THIS LOW POSITION. AFTER TWOREPETITIONS, CHUCK’S CHARACTER EXPECTS MORE OF THE SAME AND NEVER SEES THAT HIGHHOOK THAT THWACKS HIM ON THE SIDE OF THE HEAD. THIS IS THE BEAUTY OF KEEPING THEFRONT HAND LOW. YOU CAN THROW UPPERCUTS, HIGH HOOKS, LOW HOOKS, SHOVEL HOOKS,CORKSCREWS, AND, OF COURSE, THE STRAIGHT LEAD FROM THIS POSITION. IT’S MUCH MOREDECEPTIVE THAN KEEPING BOTH HANDS UP ALL THE TIME.FINALLY, AT 86 MINUTES AND 55 SECONDS, WE HAVE A TEXTBOOK EXAMPLE OF THE STOPHIT. BUT FIRST WE MUST SET A PATTERN. CHUCK KICKS. BRUCE BACKS AWAY. CHUCK KICKSAGAIN. BRUCE BACKS AWAY. CHUCK STARTS TO KICK ONCE MORE. THIRD TIME’S A CHARM.ON THE HALF-BEAT, BRUCE MOVES IN TO INTERCEPT WITH THE STRAIGHT THEN FOLLOWSWITH A CROSS, A HOOK, ANOTHER CROSS, AND ANOTHER HOOK. NOT PRETTY. IT’S ALL DOWNHILL FOR CHUCK’S CHARACTER AFTER THAT.[../Images/2.jpg]O T H E R S O U R C E SIF YOU WANT TO SEE SOMEONE IN THE FLESH PROPERLY EXECUTING JEET KUNE DOTECHNIQUES, I’D RECOMMEND THE MAN WHO SPENT MORE TIME THAN ANYONE ELSE INPRIVATE INSTRUCTION WITH BRUCE HIMSELF, TED WONG.6 IF YOU CAN, ATTEND ONE OF HISSEMINARS. IF NOT, THERE ARE SOME GOOD VIDEO SOURCES. THOUGH DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN,TAPED SEGMENTS FROM THE ANNUAL BRUCE LEE SEMINARS HELD BY THE JUN FAN JEET KUNEDO NUCLEUS IN THE LATE 1990S WERE MADE AVAILABLE FOR A LIMITED TIME. THERE’SALSO A VIDEO PRODUCED BY BLACK BELT MAGAZINE FEATURING TED WONG AND RICHARDBUSTILLO. THERE ISN’T MUCH EXPLANATION OF THE STRAIGHT LEAD, BUT YOU CAN ATLEAST OBSERVE TED WONG’S TECHNIQUE, HIS STANCE, AND FOOTWORK, ALL OF WHICH ARECONSISTENT WITH THE TEACHINGS AND WRITINGS OF BRUCE LEE.FINALLY, AT THE 2003 BRUCE LEE CONVENTION IN BURBANK, SOME FOOTAGE OF BRUCESPARRING WAS SHOWN. AT THE TIME OF THIS WRITING, PLANS ARE UNDER WAY TOEVENTUALLY RELEASE THIS FOOTAGE IN WHICH BRUCE LANDS STRAIGHT LEAD AFTERSTRAIGHT LEAD. PERHAPS BY THE TIME THIS BOOK IS PUBLISHED, IT WILL BE AVAILABLETO THE PUBLIC.[../Images/2.jpg]P R O P E R I N S T R U C T I O NIT ALWAYS AMAZES ME THAT PEOPLE PAY GOOD MONEY TO LEARN JEET KUNE DO FROMINSTRUCTORS WHO SUPPOSEDLY TEACH BRUCE LEE’S ART BUT MOVE NOTHING LIKE BRUCE.THAT’S FINE IF YOU LIKE WHAT YOU’RE LEARNING, BUT IF YOU WANT TO THROW ASTRAIGHT LEAD, THEN YOU’D BE BETTER OFF WITH REPEATED VIEWINGS OF THE CLIPS I’VEJUST MENTIONED. I’M NOT SAYING YOU HAVE TO FIND SOMEONE WHO MOVES EXACTLY LIKEBRUCE. BUT THERE ARE SOME FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS THAT SHOULD BE THERE, THINGSWE’VE OUTLINED IN THIS BOOK THAT CAN BE FOUND IN BRUCE LEE’S OWN WRITINGS—THESTRONG SIDE FORWARD, PROPER ALIGNMENT, THUMBS-UP LEAD HAND, SNAPPYFOLLOW-THROUGH, CORRECT MOVEMENT SEQUENCE, AN EXPLOSIVE PUSH-OFF, AND LIGHT ANDPRECISE FOOTWORK.FINALLY, IF YOU’RE GOING TO LEARN SOMETHING FROM SOMEONE, DOESN’T IT MAKE SENSETHAT HE BE ABLE TO PERFORM THE TECHNIQUE HE’S TRYING TO TEACH? AGAIN, SOUNDSLIKE COMMON SENSE, BUT YOU’D BE SURPRISED. BEFORE YOU FOLLOW ANYONE’SINSTRUCTION, YOU NEED TO SEE FOR YOURSELF. CAN THIS PERSON HIT? MOVE? EVENBETTER, HOLD THE FOCUS PADS FOR THE INSTRUCTOR. YOU SHOULD FEEL ACCURACY ANDFOCUSED, EXPLOSIVE FORCE IN EVERY PUNCH. IT WOULD ALSO MAKE SENSE THAT HE SPAR.FOR HOW ELSE COULD THE INSTRUCTOR KNOW HOW TO APPLY THE TECHNIQUES HE IS TRYINGTO TEACH YOU?IF YOU’RE STILL NOT SURE, GO BACK TO THE CLIPS I’VE JUST DISCUSSED. EVEN IFYOU’RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK WITH A GOOD INSTRUCTOR, YOU SHOULD STILL BE SPENDINGHOURS WITH THOSE CLIPS, WITH BRUCE. WATCH THEM. ANALYZE THEM. REMEMBER THEM. THEANSWERS ARE THERE.[../Images/2.jpg]N O T E S1 LEE, TAO OF JEET KUNE DO, P. 143.2 AS BRUCE MENTIONED ON THE SHOW LONGSTREET, HE USES HIS LONGEST WEAPON, THESIDEKICK, AGAINST THE NEAREST TARGET, HIS OPPONENT’S KNEECAP.3 TED WONG WITH JOHN LITTLE, “AN INTERVIEW WITH TED WONG,” BRUCE LEE: THEOFFICIAL PUBLICATION & VOICE OF THE JUN FAN JEET KUNE DO NUCLEUS, FEBRUARY 1998,P. 12.

REALKNOWLEDGE BREEDS ‘BODY FEEL’ AND PERSONAL EXPRESSION. SURFACE KNOWLEDGE BREEDSMECHANICAL CONDITIONING, IMPOSES LIMITATIONS, AND SQUELCHES CREATIVITY.”1OVER THE YEARS, SOME HAVE MISINTERPRETED BRUCE’S WORDS REGARDING PERSONALEXPRESSION TO MEAN “ANYTHING GOES”—THAT BY TAKING A LITTLE BIT OF THIS AND ALITTLE BIT OF THAT FROM MANY DIFFERENT ARTS MEANS THEY ARE PRACTICING JKD.IRONICALLY, THIS LEADS TO THE VERY SURFACE KNOWLEDGE AND MECHANICAL CONDITIONINGTHAT BRUCE WAS RAILING AGAINST. JEET KUNE DO IS NOT THE POINTLESS ACCUMULATIONOF KNOWLEDGE. SIMPLY TAKING ELEMENTS FROM OTHER ARTS AND PLACING THEM OUTSIDETHE CONTEXT OF THEIR ORIGINAL SYSTEMS IS NOT ONLY ILLOGICAL. IT’S ALSODISRESPECTFUL. BASTARDIZING OTHER ARTS WITH NO RHYME OR REASON LEADS TO THE MOSTSURFACE AND SHALLOW LEVELS OF UNDERSTANDING. DOES THE PERPETRATOR KNOW THEUNDERLYING MECHANICS AND PRINCIPLES BEHIND A PILFERED TECHNIQUE? DOES HE KNOWHOW TO USE IT IN A COMBATIVE SITUATION?TRUE UNDERSTANDING MEANS KNOWING A PARTICULAR TECHNIQUE FROM ALL ANGLES—ALL THEADVANTAGES, ALL THE DISADVANTAGES, WHEN AND WHEN NOT TO USE IT. IT MEANS KNOWINGTHAT TECHNIQUE INSIDE AND OUT AND BEING ABLE TO EXPLAIN THE WHYS BEHIND THEBIOMECHANICS. A TECHNIQUE SHOULD NOT BE INCORPORATED INTO ANY SYSTEM UNTIL THESEQUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED.[../Images/2.jpg]X A N D YREMEMBER, BRUCE DID NOT CHOOSE EVERYTHING FOR HIS FIGHTING SYSTEM. HE CHOSECERTAIN THINGS—THE THUMBS-UP FIST, THE RAISED HEEL, THE RAPIER—TO THE EXCLUSIONOF OTHERS—THE PALM-DOWN FIST, THE GROUNDED HEEL, AND THE BROADSWORD. WE HAVESPENT MUCH OF THIS BOOK EXPLAINING BRUCE’S REASONING BEHIND HIS CHOICES.BOXING HAS BEEN CALLED THE SWEET SCIENCE, AND IF JKD IS A SCIENCE AS WELL—AND ITIS—THEN THERE ARE CERTAIN LAWS OF SCIENCE THAT MUST BE FOLLOWED. THESE ARE NOTJUST STRATEGIC, FIGHTING SCIENCE LAWS, BUT LAWS OF PHYSICS, THE EFFECTS OF WHICHWE EXPERIENCE EVERY DAY. THESE ARE RULES OF GRAVITY AND MOTION THAT GOVERN THEPHYSICAL WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE.WHILE BRUCE MAY HAVE SAID JEET KUNE DO IS “ONLY A NAME,” MAKE NO MISTAKE. IT ISITS OWN SYSTEM. TO PRACTICE SOMETHING ELSE AND STILL CALL IT JEET KUNE DO, TOMISREPRESENT JEET KUNE DO, IS TO DENY ITS VERY EXISTENCE. WHETHER COMMITTED OUTOF MALICE OR IGNORANCE, TO DO SO DESECRATES BRUCE LEE’S NAME.FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE STILL NOT CONVINCED, YOU NEED ONLY TURN TO PAGE 50 OFBRUCE LEE’S COMMENTARIES ON THE MARTIAL WAY:[../Images/a.jpg] X IS JEET KUNE DO.[../Images/a.jpg] Y IS THE STYLE YOU WILL REPRESENT.[../Images/a.jpg] TO REPRESENT AND TEACH Y ONE SHOULD DRILL ITS MEMBERSACCORDING TO THE PREACHING OF Y.[../Images/a.jpg] THIS IS THE SAME WITH ANYONE WHO IS QUALIFIED AND HAS BEENAPPROVED TO REPRESENT X.[../Images/a.jpg] TO JUSTIFY BY INTERFUSING X AND Y IS BASICALLY THE DENYING OFY—BUT STILL CALLING IT Y.[../Images/a.jpg] A MAN, AS YOU PUT IT, IS ONE WHO IS NOBLE TO STICK TO THE ROADHE HAS CHOSEN.[../Images/a.jpg] A GARDEN OF ROSES WILL YIELD ROSES, AND A GARDEN OF VIOLETSWILL YIELD VIOLETS.2FOR MANY YEARS NOW, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PRACTICING Y AND CALLING IT X.

THE TALE OF XAND Y, BY THE WAY, IS TAKEN FROM A LETTER FROM BRUCE TO HIS STUDENT JERRYPOTEET, WHO WANTED TO MIX JKD DRILLS WITH KENPO KARATE. OBVIOUSLY BRUCEOBJECTED.3THE STRONGEST EVIDENCE AGAINST THE IDEA THAT JKD IS ANYTHING YOU WANT IT TO BECOMES FROM BRUCE HIMSELF:> IN ANY PHYSICAL MOVEMENT THERE IS ALWAYS A MOST EFFICIENT AND ALIVE MANNER TO> ACCOMPLISH THE PURPOSE OF THE PERFORMANCE FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL. THAT IS, IN> REGARD TO PROPER LEVERAGE, BALANCE IN MOVEMENT, ECONOMICAL AND EFFICIENT USE> OF MOTION AND ENERGY, ETC. LIVE, EFFICIENT MOVEMENT THAT LIBERATES IS ONE> THING; STERILE CLASSICAL SETS THAT BIND AND CONDITION IS ANOTHER.4THERE IS A CRUCIAL DISTINCTION HERE. IT IS ONE THING TO FOLLOW THE LAWS OFSCIENCE. IT IS QUITE ANOTHER TO BLINDLY FOLLOW WHAT IS POPULAR “KNOWLEDGE.” WEUSED TO THINK THE EARTH WAS FLAT, BUT IT HAS SINCE BEEN SCIENTIFICALLY PROVENTHAT IT IS NOT. THAT DOESN’T MEAN WE NOW REVERT TO DECLARING THAT IT’S FLAT JUSTBECAUSE WE FEEL LIKE IT.THE SAME SHOULD APPLY TO JKD. WE USED TO THINK THROWING A JAB ONE WAY WASEFFECTIVE. OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF EVOLUTION AND WITH BRUCE LEE’S RESEARCH,WE WERE INTRODUCED TO A MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE FIGHTING SYSTEM AND A BETTER WAY TOTHROW A PUNCH. UNFORTUNATELY, INSTEAD OF BUILDING ON AND REFINING WHAT BRUCE LEEDEVELOPED, THERE ARE THOSE WHO SAY— AGAIN, WHETHER OUT OF MALICE ORIGNORANCE—THAT ADDING UNTESTED AND UNRELATED TECHNIQUES OR TECHNICALEMBELLISHMENTS MEANS THEY ARE IMPROVING JKD. WRONG.WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS ANTI-JKD IN TWO WAYS. FIRST, THEY ARE DEVIATING FROM THEVERY SCIENTIFIC, PHYSICAL LAWS ON WHICH THE ART WAS BUILT. TWO, ADDINGTECHNIQUES IS ALSO PHILOSOPHICALLY ANTI-JKD, FOR AS BRUCE HIMSELF WROTE, “IT ISNOT HOW MUCH ONE LEARNS BUT HOW MUCH ONE HAS ABSORBED IN WHAT HE HAS LEARNED.THE BEST TECHNIQUES ARE THE SIMPLE ONES, EXECUTED CORRECTLY.”5 ONCE AGAIN, GOBACK TO THE ROOTS.AND OF HIS STUDENTS, BRUCE SAID, “[THEY] WILL REALIZE THE FUTILE SEARCH FOR MOREAND MORE NEW TECHNIQUES. RATHER THEY WILL DEVOTE THE NEEDED HOURS TO PRACTICINGTHE CORRECT EXECUTION OF SIMPLE TECHNIQUES.”6 UNFORTUNATELY, THIS HAS NOT ALWAYSBEEN THE CASE. INSTEAD OF SPENDING THE REQUIRED TIME ON REFINING AND PERFECTINGTHE FUNDAMENTALS—STANCE, MECHANICS, FOOTWORK—SO-CALLED JKD PRACTITIONERS SKIPSTEPS, ADD TO TECHNIQUES WITHOUT INVESTIGATING, AND NEVER EVER GRASP THE MOSTFUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES ON WHICH THE ART WAS BUILT. WORST STILL, THEYMISREPRESENT THEIR MISH-MASH AS JKD.IF SOMEONE WANTS TO ADD A TECHNIQUE TO HIS ARSENAL OR EMBELLISH ON AN EXISTINGJKD TECHNIQUE, FINE. BUT DO NOT CALL IT JEET KUNE DO. AND HE SHOULD BE PREPAREDTO BACK UP THE VALIDITY OF ITS USE WITH SOUND, SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE.PUBLICLY, HE MAY HAVE SAID HE DIDN’T BELIEVE IN STYLES, BUT BRUCE LEE CLEARLYSAW JKD AS SOMETHING THAT STANDS APART FROM OTHER SYSTEMS. “MY JKD,” HE WROTE INA LETTER TO A FRIEND, “IS REALLY SOMETHING ELSE. . . MORE AND MORE I PITY THEMARTIAL ARTS THAT ARE BLINDED BY THEIR PARTIALITY AND IGNORANCE.”7[../Images/2.jpg]“H A V I N G N O F O R M ” V E R S U S H A V I N G “N O - F O R M ”OVER THE YEARS, MANY HAVE MISINTERPRETED BRUCE LEE’S WORDS REGARDING “NO WAY ASWAY.” THEY PRACTICE AND TEACH WHATEVER THEY WANT AND THEN CALL IT JEET KUNE DO,AND AS A RESULT, THE ACTUAL TECHNIQUES THAT BRUCE LEE DEVELOPED ARE BEING LOST.REMEMBER, BRUCE WAS QUESTIONING THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF CLASSICAL MARTIAL ARTSTRAINING. WE NEED TO PLACE HIS WORDS IN THEIR PROPER CONTEXT. AT THAT TIME, HEREALIZED CLASSICAL ARTS HAD NOT PROGRESSED AND THAT THEIR TECHNIQUES WERE BASEDON TRADITION, NOT SCIENCE.TODAY, HOWEVER, THE PENDULUM HAS SWUNG TOO FAR IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. MUCHOF WHAT MASQUERADES AS JKD IS UNDISCIPLINED, UNSCIENTIFIC, AND UTTERLYDISORGANIZED CHAOS. IT SEEMS THAT BRUCE DID, IN FACT, ANTICIPATE THISMISCONCEPTION WHEN HE WROTE THE FOLLOWING:> PEOPLE OFTEN MISTAKENLY [BELIEVE] THAT JKD IS AGAINST FORM. I DON’T THINK I’LL> GO INTO DETAIL ON THAT, AS OTHER PARAGRAPHS WILL CLARIFY THAT. ONE THING WE> MUST UNDERSTAND: THAT IS, THERE IS ALWAYS A MOST EFFICIENT AND ALIVE MANNER TO> CARRY OUT A MOVEMENT (AND THAT THE BASIC LAWS OF LEVERAGE, BODY POSITION,> BALANCE, FOOT-WORK, AND SO FORTH, ARE NOT TO BE VIOLATED). HOWEVER, ALIVE,> EFFICIENT FORM IS ONE THING; STERILE CLASSICAL SETS THAT BIND AND CONDITION> ARE ANOTHER. ASIDE FROM THE ABOVE MENTIONED, ONE MUST ALSO DISTINGUISH THE> SUBTLETY BETWEEN “HAVING NO FORM” AND HAVING “NO-FORM.” THE FIRST IS> IGNORANCE, THE SECOND TRANSCENDENCE.8THERE IS A CRUCIAL DISTINCTION BEING DRAWN HERE. AS STATED ABOVE, THE “BASICLAWS,” THE LAWS OF SCIENCE ARE “NOT TO BE VIOLATED.” NOT TO BE VIOLATED. FAILURETO MASTER THE BASICS IS WHAT BRUCE REFERRED TO AS “HAVING NO FORM.” THIS ISSIMPLY IGNORANCE.“NO-FORM,” IN CONTRAST, IS THAT LEVEL OF SKILL AT WHICH THE BASICS HAVE BEENMASTERED TO THE DEGREE THAT THEIR USE IS PURELY INSTINCTUAL. THIS DOESN’T MEANTHAT THERE ISN’T A CORRECT WAY OF DOING THINGS. OBVIOUSLY, FROM THE PASSAGEABOVE, BRUCE BELIEVED THERE ARE RIGHT AND WRONG WAYS OF PERFORMING TECHNIQUES.“NO-FORM” IS THAT LEVEL OF EXECUTING THOSE TECHNIQUES TO SUCH PERFECTION THATDOING SO NO LONGER REQUIRES THOUGHT.9 THIS IS TRANSCENDENCE, BUT IT CAN ONLY BEREACHED ONCE THE BASICS HAVE BEEN HONED AND PERFECTED.[../Images/2.jpg]J U N F A N J E E T K U N E D O V E R S U S J E E T K U N E D ONOW WOULD BE A GOOD TIME TO ADDRESS THE TITLE OF THIS BOOK, WHICH USES THE TERMJUN FAN JEET KUNE DO INSTEAD OF JEET KUNE DO. BECAUSE OF BRUCE LEE’S UNEXPECTEDDEATH, OWNERSHIP OF THE NAME JEET KUNE DO WAS NEVER CLAIMED, AND THOSE WHO HAVESINCE CAPITALIZED ON THIS SITUATION HAVE NEARLY DESTROYED HIS ART. TRAGICALLY,THEY HAVE RENDERED THE NAME JEET KUNE DO MEANINGLESS.TRUE, BRUCE LEE BELIEVED IN PROGRESSION AND IMPROVEMENT, BUT THE CONFUSION ANDMISREPRESENTATION OF JKD OVER THE LAST THREE DECADES HAS MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FORFUTURE GENERATIONS TO DETERMINE WHAT INFORMATION ACTUALLY ORIGINATED FROM BRUCELEE HIMSELF.AFTER MUCH LEGAL WORK, THE BRUCE LEE FOUNDATION HAS RECLAIMED THE NAME JUN FANJEET KUNE DO TO REPRESENT THE AUTHENTIC TEACHINGS OF BRUCE LEE. “JUN FAN,” LEE’SCHINESE NAME, HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE ORIGINAL NAME JEET KUNE DO TO DIFFERENTIATEBETWEEN BRUCE LEE’S ART AND THAT OF THOSE WHO WOULD MISREPRESENT IT.THE PURPOSE OF THIS BOOK HAS BEEN TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT, NOT ONLY BYREFERRING TO LEE’S OWN WRITINGS, BUT ALSO BY GOING ONE STEP FURTHER AND TRACINGTHOSE SOURCES THAT HAD INFLUENCED HIM. IN THE SERVICE OF BREVITY, WE’VE USED THEORIGINAL TERM JEET KUNE DO, BUT THE MATERIAL PRESENTED THROUGHOUT THIS VOLUME,AS INDICATED BY THE TITLE, DOES FALL UNDER THE NAME JUN FAN JEET KUNE DO.DESIGNATION OF SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIAL AS JUN FAN JEET KUNE DO MUST BEAPPROVED BY THE BRUCE LEE FOUNDATION. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE NAME JUN FANJEET KUNE DO AND WHERE TO FIND ACCURATE INSTRUCTION AND INFORMATION ON THE ARTOF JUN FAN JEET KUNE DO, VISIT THE OFFICIAL SITE OF THE BRUCE LEE FOUNDATION ATWWW.BRUCELEEFOUNDATION.COM [http://www.bruceleefoundation.com].[../Images/2.jpg]P H Y S I C A L W O R L DALL OF THE CONFUSION AND CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING JKD TODAY, OF COURSE, STEMSFROM THE FACT THAT BRUCE LEE’S UNTIMELY DEATH MEANT THAT WE WERE NEVER LEFT WITHA DEFINITIVE TEXTBOOK ON THE MOST ADVANCED STAGES OF JKD. THE NOTES THAT BECAMETHE TAO OF JEET KUNE DO AND BRUCE LEE’S COMMENTARIES ON THE MARTIAL WAY WERENEVER INTENDED TO APPEAR AS THEY DO IN THEIR PUBLISHED FORMS. WHAT WE GOT WERE,AT BEST, ROUGHLY OUTLINED NOTES THAT MAKE LIMITED TECHNICAL SENSE WITHOUTSTEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTION.WITHOUT A TECHNICAL CORE FROM WHICH TO DRAW, PEOPLE HAVE FIXATED ON THEPHILOSOPHICAL PRINCIPLES OF JKD. BUT MERELY SPOUTING PHILOSOPHY DOES NOT MAKESOMEONE A JKD PRACTITIONER.WE BEGAN OUR JOURNEY WITH SOME WORDS FROM TAKUAN SOHO, SO IT’S ONLY FITTING THATWE SHOULD END IN THE SAME WAY:> THERE IS SUCH A THING AS TRAINING IN PRINCIPLE, AND SUCH A THING AS TRAINING> IN TECHNIQUE.> > PRINCIPLE IS: WHEN YOU ARRIVE, NOTHING IS NOTICED. IT IS SIMPLY AS THOUGH YOU> HAD DISCARDED ALL CONCENTRATION.> > IF YOU DO NOT TRAIN IN TECHNIQUE, BUT ONLY FILL YOUR BREAST WITH PRINCIPLE,> YOUR BODY AND YOUR HANDS WILL NOT FUNCTION. TRAINING IN TECHNIQUE, IF PUT INTO> TERMS OF OUR OWN MARTIAL ART, IS IN THE TRAINING THAT IF PRACTICED OVER AND> OVER AGAIN MAKES THE FIVE BODY POSTURES ONE.> > EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW PRINCIPLE, YOU MUST MAKE YOURSELF PERFECTLY FREE IN THE> USE OF TECHNIQUE. AND EVEN THOUGH YOU MAY WIELD THE SWORD THAT YOU CARRY WITH> YOU WELL, IF YOU ARE UNCLEAR ON THE DEEPEST ASPECTS OF PRINCIPLE, YOU WILL> LIKELY FALL SHORT OF PROFICIENCY.> > TECHNIQUE AND PRINCIPLE ARE JUST LIKE THE TWO WHEELS OF A CART.10FOR SEVERAL DECADES NOW, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO ROLL THEIR JKD CART WITH ONEWHEEL. IT IS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THIS BOOK TO ADDRESS THE PHILOSOPHICAL SIDE OFJKD, AND BESIDES, IT IS MORE THAN ADEQUATELY ACCOUNTED FOR BY JOHN LITTLE’SEXCELLENT CATALOGUING OF BRUCE LEE’S OWN WORDS.11WHAT I’VE GIVEN YOU HERE IS A PART OF THE OTHER WHEEL, IF YOU WILL—THE TECHNICALWHEEL. THIS DOCUMENTATION OF THE HOWS AND WHYS OF THE STRAIGHT LEAD IS ANATTEMPT TO RECOVER SOME OF WHAT HAS BEEN LOST THROUGH MISINTERPRETATION,MISREPRESENTATION, AND THE AMBITION AND PERSONAL ADVANCEMENT OF CERTAININDIVIDUALS. AS TED WONG TOLD BLACK BELT MAGAZINE, “YOU HAVE TO PRESERVE [BRUCELEE’S] ART AT SOME POINT TO PREVENT IT FROM COMPLETELY DISAPPEARING. OTHERWISE,HE’S JUST A NAME; HE DIED AND HE’S GONE. SO RIGHT OR WRONG, THAT’S MY DESIRE—TOPRESERVE BRUCE LEE’S JEET KUNE DO. I’M [SHARING MY KNOWLEDGE] TO HONOR HIM.”12AND SO THE PURPOSE OF THIS BOOK—ITS ULTIMATE AIM—HAS BEEN TO HONOR BRUCE LEE.[../Images/2.jpg]N O T E S1 BRUCE LEE, ED.

AS BRUCE LEE’SPERSONAL DAYTIMERS REVEAL, WONG WAS BRUCE LEE’S PRIVATE STUDENT FROM JULY 27,1967 TO OCTOBER 14, 1971 AND SPENT MORE TIME IN PRIVATE INSTRUCTION WITH BRUCETHAN ANY OTHER INDIVIDUAL. THE DAYTIMERS SHOW THE TWO HAD A MINIMUM OF 122SEPARATE APPOINTMENTS TOGETHER.1, 2 WONG RECEIVED JEET KUNE DO CERTIFICATIONDIRECTLY FROM BRUCE LEE HIMSELF.AS M. UYEHARA WROTE IN BRUCE LEE: THE INCOMPARABLE FIGHTER:> I STILL THINK BRUCE CONSIDERED TED WONG AS HIS PROTÉGÉ BEFORE HIS DEATH. WONG> WAS HIS CONSTANT COMPANION FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS. BESIDES WORKING OUT ON> WEDNESDAY NIGHTS, WONG ALSO CAME TO SEE BRUCE ON WEEKENDS. WHEN BRUCE NEEDED A> SPARRING PARTNER, IT WAS WONG HE SELECTED.3BUT RECORDS AND TESTIMONIAL ASIDE, ONE NEED ONLY OBSERVE TED WONG DEMONSTRATEJKD TECHNIQUES TO SEE THAT NO ONE ELSE MOVES MORE LIKE BRUCE. THAT HE IS STILLPERFORMING THOSE TECHNIQUES WITH MORE SKILL, PRECISION, AND POWER THAN HE DIDOVER THREE DECADES AGO IS A TESTAMENT TO THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF JEET KUNEDO.COULD YOU EXPLAIN HOW BRUCE CAME TO LOOK INTO BOXING AND FENCING LITERATURE ASINFLUENCES ON JKD?I DON’T KNOW EXACTLY WHEN HE STARTED TO LOOK INTO DEMPSEY AND NADI. BACK IN 1963HE HAD AN ALTERCATION WITH THE KUNG FU ARTIST FROM CHINA. THAT WAS THE BIRTH OFJEET KUNE DO. HE REALIZED THAT WHAT HE HAD LEARNED WAS NOT THAT FUNCTIONAL. AFIGHT THAT SHOULD HAVE TAKEN A FEW SECONDS TOOK HIM THREE MINUTES TO FINISH.AFTER THAT HE REALIZED HE WAS NOT REALLY IN SHAPE AND STARTED TO LOOK FOR A WAYTO CONDITION HIMSELF. AND IT FORCED HIM TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX. I WOULD SAYTHAT’S THE BIRTH OF JEET KUNE DO. THAT ONE INCIDENT CAUSED HIM TO LOOK ELSEWHEREAND FORCED HIM TO LOOK INTO A BETTER WAY TO TRAIN. I THINK HE LOOKED INTO BOXINGBEFORE THAT, BUT HE REALLY LOOKED INTO BOXING AND FENCING AS A WAY TO EDUCATEHIMSELF.DID HE MENTION DRISCOLL AND DEMPSEY WHILE YOU WERE TRAINING WITH HIM?I REMEMBER HE SHOWED ME A PICTURE OF JIM DRISCOLL. (SEE FIGURE 121.) I DIDN’TEVEN KNOW WHO DRISCOLL WAS, BUT HE LOOKED INTO DRISCOLL’S BOOKS, I WOULD SAY,AROUND 1968. I WAS AT HIS HOME AND HE MENTIONED DRISCOLL. ACCORDING TO BOXINGHISTORIANS, HE THREW THE PUREST, STRAIGHTEST LEAD HAND. HE KNOCKED PEOPLE OUTWITH THE JAB. I THINK BECAUSE OF THE STRUCTURE, HIS ALIGNMENT. WHEN HE THREW APUNCH, HE REALLY TRANSFERRED ALL THE WEIGHT INTO IT. NO BOXER HAS THROWN A PUNCHLIKE THAT. BRUCE SHOWED ME THE PICTURE OF DRISCOLL AND SAID YOU TURN SIDEWAYSAND LINE UP LIKE THIS TO THROW THE LEAD PUNCH. YOU KNOW, NO BOXING JAB IS THROWNLIKE THAT NOW. IT’S ALWAYS SQUARED OFF. DRISCOLL REALLY GAVE HIM THE IDEA OF HOWTO THROW THE LEAD HAND. WING CHUN DOESN’T THROW THAT WAY. BOXING DOESN’T THROWTHAT WAY. SO DRISCOLL GAVE HIM THE IDEA OF HOW TO UTILIZE THE LEAD HAND. ANDALSO FENCING. I WOULD NOT SAY THE LEAD HAND CAME FROM ONLY DRISCOLL, OR ONLYDEMPSEY, OR ONLY FENCING, BUT THE THOUGHT—THE IDEAS—CAME FROM THEM. AND EVEN INBOXING, THEY DO NOT REALLY TELL YOU THE MECHANICS— THE WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION, THESTRUCTURE. HOW YOU STRUCTURE YOUR STANCE DETERMINES HOW YOU DELIVER YOUR PUNCH.THE STRUCTURE OF JEET KUNE DO, THE STANCE, IS MORE LIKE A FENCER’S STANCE. SO,WHEN YOU DELIVER THE FRONT HAND, IT’S MORE LIKE A SWORD THRUST. ALL THE MOVEMENTAND MOBILITY, THE TACTICS, HOW TO BRIDGE THE GAP, THE SPEED, HOW TO DELIVER THELEAD PUNCH, THE STRATEGY ALL COME FROM FENCING.DID HE MENTION NADI TO YOU?NO.HOW DID YOU KNOW TO GO TO HIM?IN HIS LIBRARY, I NOTICED ON FENCING WAS HERE. LATER ON, I TRACED SOME OF BRUCELEE’S NOTES TO IT. A LOT OF THE TAO IS NOTES THAT COME FROM BOXING AND FENCING.YOU CAN TRACE THE NOTES—SOME EVEN WORD FOR WORD FROM CERTAIN BOOKS. LIKE NADI’SBOOK, DEMPSEY, A LOT FROM HAISLET. LATER ON, WHEN I STARTED TO COLLECT BOXINGBOOKS, I KNEW THAT HE HAD COPIES OF THESE BOOKS, TOO. SO BY READING THEM ANDCOMPARING NOTES, LITTLE BY LITTLE, I REALIZED WHERE THINGS WERE COMING FROM.THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS COMING FROM OTHER BOOKS, TOO— NOT JUST HAISLET.[../Images/208a.jpg]FIGURE 120: BRUCE LEE AND TED WONG (© LINDA LEE CADWELL).[../Images/209a.jpg]FIGURE 121: THE PICTURE THAT BRUCE LEE SHOWED TED WONG TO ILLUSTRATE STRAIGHTPUNCHING. ACCORDING TO WONG, LEE POINTED TO THIS PHOTO AND SAID, “YOU THROW THESTRAIGHT LEAD LIKE THIS.”IN THE TAO, THERE’S A LOT OF CASTELLO. IS THERE A LOT OF CASTELLO IN THESTRAIGHT LEAD?YEAH, THE WAY HE DELIVERED THE LEAD HAND. VERY FEW BOXERS DELIVERED THE LEADHAND LIKE DEMPSEY. DEMPSEY WOULD TALK ABOUT THE THUMBS UP. AND THE WAY DRISCOLLTHREW THE STRAIGHT IS VERY MUCH LIKE THE WAY [BRUCE] WOULD DELIVER THE LEADHAND.DURING THE TIME THAT HE WAS WORKING WITH YOU, DID HE MENTION DEMPSEY?HE MENTIONED DEMPSEY, DIFFERENT BOXERS, THE OLD TIMERS. IN FACT, SOMETIMES HEWOULD ASK ME IF I KNEW OF CERTAIN BOXERS FROM THE ‘40S THROUGH THE ‘60S LIKESUGAR RAY ROBINSON AND ROCKY MARCIANO, JACK JOHNSON. EVEN BEFORE I TOOK UPMARTIAL ARTS, BOXING WAS ONE OF MY INTERESTS. I DIDN’T PRACTICE IT, BUT I READ ALOT ABOUT IT. I’D READ MARCIANO’S BOOK. I BOUGHT EVERY ISSUE OF RING MAGAZINE.SO, WHEN BRUCE WOULD ASK ME IF I KNEW OF CERTAIN BOXERS, I WOULD KNOW, SO HE WASKIND OF SURPRISED. THAT’S WHY HE OPENED UP TO ME WHEN DISCUSSING BOXING.DID HE DISCUSS SPECIFIC THINGS FROM DEMPSEY THAT HE WAS INCORPORATING?SEE BRUCE LEE PRETTY MUCH KEPT A LOT OF THINGS TO HIMSELF. EVEN IN A LETTER HEWROTE TO WILLIAM CHEUNG, HE SAID NOT TO SHARE WITH ANYBODY—KEEP IT TO YOURSELF.OCCASIONALLY HE’D TELL ME SOMETHING, BUT WHAT I LEARNED FROM HIM—HALF WASTHROUGH INSTRUCTION. THE OTHER HALF WAS THROUGH OBSERVATION. MAYBE I’M ONE OFTHE LUCKY FEW WHO WAS ABLE TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH HIM TRAINING. A LOT OFTIMES, HE USED ME AS A SPARRING PARTNER. SO, I COULD WATCH HIS MOVES. THE WAYHE’D MOVE. THE TIMING, THE FOOTWORK. SO, I LEARNED A LOT FROM HIM THROUGHOBSERVATION. IF I DIDN’T HAVE THAT KIND OF TIME WITH HIM, I’D NEVER, NEVER HAVELEARNED FROM HIM.SO, IN TERMS OF MECHANICS, WHAT KIND OF THINGS DID HE ACTUALLY SHOW YOU?THE ROTATIONAL MOVEMENT, THE ALIGNMENT, HOW TO TRANSFER THE WEIGHT THUMBS UP.HOW TO PUT THE HIP INTO IT. THE STRUCTURE OF THE STANCE. HE EXPLAINED ONLY ALITTLE BIT. LATER ON, I STARTED COLLECTING THE BOOKS MYSELF AND THEN I WOULD SEETHAT ALL OF THOSE THINGS WERE COMING FROM CERTAIN BOOKS. EVEN THINGS LIKE THEHAND BEFORE FOOT WAS NOT BEING TAUGHT AT THE SCHOOL. THAT WAS SOMETHING HESHOWED US AT HIS HOME. MOST OF THE TIME IT WAS JUST HIM AND ME, OR HERB JACKSON[ANOTHER STUDENT OF BRUCE LEE’S WHO ALSO BUILT MUCH OF LEE’S CUSTOM TRAININGEQUIPMENT] AND ME AT HIS HOME. EVERY WEDNESDAY. SOMETIMES SUNDAY WITH A GROUP.BUT WITH A GROUP IT WAS JUST BASICALLY A WORKOUT. I THINK AT THAT TIME HE WASSTILL SORT OF EXPERIMENTING.SO, YOU GOT TO SEE A LOT OF THAT EXPERIMENTATION?YEAH. BUT AT THAT TIME, HE WOULDN’T ALWAYS FULLY EXPLAIN WHAT HE WAS WORKING ON.HE MIGHT JUST SAY TURN THE HIP INTO IT, THUMBS UP, HAND BEFORE FOOT, BUT HEWOULDN’T GO INTO A LOT OF DETAIL.AND YOU ALSO HAVE PHOTOCOPIES OF HIS BOOKS WITH HIS NOTES IN THEM?OH YEAH. SEE, NOBODY HAS THOSE NOTES. YOU CAN BUY THE BOOKS, BUT BRUCE LEE HADWRITTEN NOTES IN HIS COPIES, UNDERLINED THINGS.WHAT DID HE SHOW YOU IN TERMS OF FOOTWORK?HALF THE FOOTWORK HE JUST SHOWED ME HOW TO PERFORM. THE OTHER HALF I LEARNED BYLOOKING AT HIM. THE WAY HE MOVED AND TRANSFERRED THE WEIGHT. AND THEN I WAS ABLETO PUT THEM TOGETHER LATER ON, A LITTLE BIT AT A TIME. MOST OF THIS STUFF IDISCOVERED. ALL OF THE LITTLE DETAILS I LEARNED LATER ON. THE MOVEMENT, THEUNDERSTANDING THROUGH OBSERVATION. THE REALLY INTRICATE MOVEMENT, GAININGINSIGHT INTO EACH MOVEMENT, AND THE REASON BEHIND EACH ONE—I BASICALLYDISCOVERED THROUGH YEARS OF PRACTICE, OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AND THEN A LITTLE BITAT A TIME, I STARTED TO UNDERSTAND WHY.LIKE THE STEALING STEP?YEAH, A LOT OF THINGS I DIDN’T UNDERSTAND AND I COULD NOT DO, I COULD NOT EVENPERFORM, AT THE BEGINNING. BUT NOW I CAN. IT’S STILL THE ORIGINAL FOOTWORK. I’MNOT ADDING THINGS TO IT. I CAN SHOW YOU A CERTAIN PUNCH. BUT WITHOUT FOOTWORK,YOU CAN ONLY DO IT A CERTAIN WAY. YOU’RE ONE-DIMENSIONAL. FOOTWORK MAKES YOUTHREE-DIMENSIONAL, GIVING YOU MORE OPTIONS. WITH FOOTWORK, YOU CAN THROW THESAME PUNCH BUT IN ANY DIRECTION. WITHOUT FOOTWORK, YOU CAN ONLY THROW A PUNCHONE WAY. WITH FOOTWORK, YOU CAN THROW CLOCKWISE, COUNTERCLOCKWISE, WHILE MOVINGFORWARD, MOVING BACKWARD.DID THE FOOTWORK HE SHOWED YOU AT THE SCHOOL DIFFER FROM WHAT HE SHOWED YOU INTHE BACKYARD?THE FOOTWORK IN THE CHINATOWN SCHOOL WAS MORE LIKE ONE-BEAT FOOTWORK. THERE’S NOBOUNCE, NO HALF-BEAT, VERY LITTLE CURVING. WE CALLED IT STEP-THROUGH CURVING ORPIVOTING. THE FOOTWORK HE TAUGHT ME AT HIS HOUSE WAS MUCH MORE IN DEPTH AS FARAS APPLICATION. HE TALKED ABOUT THE BOUNCE, THE HALF-BEAT. THOSE THINGS MAKEFOOTWORK MORE ALIVE.WERE YOU THE ONLY PERSON HE SHOWED THAT TO?HERB WAS THERE, TOO. OTHER THAN THAT, I DON’T KNOW.DID YOU SEE A PROGRESSION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE STRAIGHT LEAD WHILE YOU WERESTUDYING WITH HIM?OH YEAH. AT THE BEGINNING, I SAW THAT WHEN HE’D THROW A LEAD HAND, THERE WAS ALITTLE CURVING OR ARCING, ESPECIALLY ON RETRACTING THE HAND. LATER ON, IT WASMUCH MORE STRAIGHT, STRAIGHT IN AND STRAIGHT OUT—MUCH MORE COMPACT AND MOREPROTECTION OF THE CENTER LINE. SO NOWADAYS, I STILL SEE PEOPLE THROWING WITH THECURVING ARC, SHOWING THAT THEY LEARNED THE LEAD PUNCH FROM HIM EARLIER ON.WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE THE BEST EXAMPLES OF THE STRAIGHT ON FILM BECAUSE THEREWAS A LOT OF DEVELOPMENT OF THAT PUNCH BETWEEN THE TIME OF THE BIG BOSS AND GAMEOF DEATH.I DO HAVE THE FOOTAGE OF THE BACKYARD TRAINING SESSION, BUT HE DOESN’T REALLYTHROW MANY THERE. JUST THE STRAIGHT BLAST. LAST YEAR AT THE BRUCE LEE CONVENTIONIN BURBANK THERE WAS SOME INCREDIBLE FOOTAGE OF BRUCE SPARRING THROWING STRAIGHTLEAD AFTER STRAIGHT.4IF YOU WERE TO LOOK AT ALL THE MOVIES, PROBABLY THE BEST EXAMPLE WITH THE MOSTJKD IN IT IS RETURN OF THE DRAGON WITH CHUCK NORRIS. I THINK THAT MOVIE HAS MOREJKD IN IT THAN ANY OF HIS OTHER FILMS. HE DOES A LOT OF INTERCEPTING KICKING ANDPUNCHING. OF COURSE, IT’S SET UP TO BE THEATRICAL, BUT YOU CAN SEE A LOT OF JKDIN THERE.IN THAT FINAL FIGHT SCENE, THERE’S A SEQUENCE THAT’S SLOWED DOWN. HE KEEPS HISHAND PRETTY LOW. IS THAT HOW HE LOOKED WHEN HE SPARRED?BASICALLY WHEN YOU SPARRED HIM, HE WASN’T MOVING LIKE IN THE MOVIES WHERE HE WASBOUNCING AROUND. HE WOULDN’T MOVE THAT MUCH. HE’D STAY IN FRONT OF YOU, NOTMOVING AT ALL. SOMETIMES HE’D MOVE A LITTLE BIT. BUT WHEN HE’D ATTACK, HE WAS SOQUICK. THAT SUDDEN MOTION FROM STILLNESS WOULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR YOU TODETECT OR GUARD AGAINST HIS MOTION. BUT WHEN HE HAD TO MOVE, HE COULD MOVE!THAT’S THE WAY HE’D FIGHT. NOT LIKE IN THE MOVIES. SO, ALL THAT FOOTWORK, YOUDON’T USE IT UNTIL THE SITUATION CALLS FOR IT. YOU DON’T BOUNCE UNNECESSARILY.HE’D MOVE AND THEN STOP, CHANGE THE TEMPO. HE WAS ALWAYS DOING SOMETHING TOCHANGE IT UP A LITTLE, BUT NOT LIKE THE MOVIES WHERE HE WOULD BE MOVING, MOVING,MOVING.IN ENTER THE DRAGON, THERE’S A LOT OF WIDE MOTION. A LOT OF SWINGING. THE SCENEWITH BOB WALL IS A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW TO HIT WITHOUT TELEGRAPHING. WE DIDTHAT A LOT AT HIS HOME JUST LIKE A GAME. IT’S A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE PUSH-OFF.YOU REALLY HAVE TO COME IN, BECAUSE WHEN YOUR HAND IS CROSSED WITH YOUROPPONENT, YOU’RE STANDING FURTHER AWAY FROM EACH OTHER. SO IF YOU WERE TO EXTENDYOUR HAND, YOU’RE NOT GOING TO REACH HIM. SO, YOU HAVE TO PUSH OFF TO GO BEYONDTHE TARGET. THE HAND HAS TO MOVE FIRST AND COME BACK WITHOUT YOUR OPPONENTTOUCHING YOU. THE HAND HAS TO MOVE FIRST. THE SAME IS TRUE OF TRAPPING. SEE, ALOT OF PEOPLE TRAP FIRST AND THEN HIT. THEY THINK TRAPPING IS PRIMARY, ANDHITTING IS SECONDARY. IN JEET KUNE DO, HITTING IS PRIMARY. TRAPPING ISSECONDARY. SO, TRAPPING IS JUST BASICALLY TO REMOVE THE BARRIER.DID HE TALK ABOUT NEWTON WITH YOU?OH YEAH, ACTION AND REACTION. THE SAME WAY WE DO. HE’D LINE YOU UP AND THEN TAPYOUR FIST.OH, DID HE DO THAT SAME TEST THAT YOU DO?5NOT AT THE SCHOOL. BUT AT HIS HOME, WHEN HE FIRST STARTED TO TEACH ME, HE’D HAVEME PUT MY FIST ON THE WALL LIKE IN THE DEMPSEY BOOK. OR WHEN WE’D DO PUSH-UPS.HE’D HAVE US TRY IT WITH THE BOTTOM THREE KNUCKLES OR THE TOP THREE KNUCKLES.AND THEN WE’D CHANGE THE WAY WE’D LINE UP. THIS WASN’T BEING TAUGHT AT THECLASS, BUT AT PRIVATE LESSONS.DID HE TALK AT ALL ABOUT WAYS TO STRATEGICALLY INCORPORATE THE STRAIGHT LEAD?HE TALKED ABOUT HOW WHEN YOU THROW A STRAIGHT LEAD, YOU COVER THE CENTERLINE. HEALSO SAID IT’S QUICKER TO RECOVER FROM. HE SAID A GOOD PUNCH DEVIATES AS LITTLEAS FROM THE ON-GUARD AS POSSIBLE. YOU SHOULD ALSO RETURN TO ON-GUARD AS QUICKLYAS POSSIBLE. ANY PUNCH THAT MEETS THAT CRITERIA IS A GOOD PUNCH. ANYTIME YOUDEVIATE FROM THE STANCE, YOU OPEN UP THE CENTER. HE ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THESTRAIGHT CAN BE USED FOR OFFENSE AND DEFENSE. YOU CAN USE IT TO KEEP YOUROPPONENT AT BAY. IT’S THE QUICKEST PUNCH AND ALSO ENABLES YOU TO APPLY FORCE,NOT LIKE A BOXING JAB. THIS ALLOWS YOU TO SET THINGS UP. OR YOU CAN USE IT AS ASINGLE DIRECT ATTACK, BECAUSE THE STRAIGHT LEAD IS A POWER PUNCH. ONCE YOU HAVEA GOOD SINGLE DIRECT ATTACK, THE REST IS EASY IF YOU’RE GOING TO USE PIA. THESTRAIGHT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO SET UP THE OTHER WAYS OF ATTACK. IF YOU DON’T HAVETHAT, THE REST WILL BE KIND OF DIFFICULT FOR YOU. ON JEET KUNE DO, THE STRATEGYIS BUILT AROUND THE LEAD HAND.DID HE DISCUSS HOW THE STRAIGHT CAN BE USED FOR SETUPS?WHEN WE WERE SPARRING HE DID EXPLAIN THAT. AND ALSO WHEN I WAS SPARRING WITHHIM, I’D SEE WHAT HE DID TO ME, SO I’D UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE THE LEAD HAND. BUTMOST OF THE TIME, HE DIDN’T EXPLAIN TO ME IN DETAIL. ALL THOSE SMALL DETAILS IDISCOVERED LATER ON. DRISCOLL TALKED ABOUT THE FOUR HITS—HIT FIRST, HIT HARD,HIT OFTEN, HIT STRAIGHT. FOR SETUP’S THE FRONT HAND IS SO IMPORTANT. IT’S THEQUICKEST. THE WAY WE THROW IT, YOU HAVE POWER. IT MAY NOT BE THE MOST POWERFULPUNCH, BUT IT’S MORE POWERFUL THAN A BOXING JAB. THE BOXING JAB DOESN’T COMPAREIN TERMS OF POWER. YOU ALSO HAVE EXTRA REACH WITH THE JKD LEAD. WHAT MAKES THEJKD PUNCH SO EFFECTIVE IS THAT THE WAY WE STAND IS PRETTY MUCH LINED UP WITH THETARGET. YOU GIVE AWAY VERY LITTLE. AND WHEN YOU MAKE A MOVE, YOU MOVE VERYLITTLE—ONLY TO COVER DISTANCE. WHEN YOU MOVE, THE ROTATION’S SO QUICK. THATCOMBINED WITH THE FOOTWORK ENABLES YOU TO REACH THE TARGET QUICKER THAN ANYOTHER PUNCH. SO, THE LEAD HAND PLUS THE FOOTWORK MAKES THE STRAIGHT THE FASTESTPUNCH. THE BACKFIST IS A LITTLE FASTER, BUT THERE’S A LITTLE LESS POWER, AND YOUFEEL MORE OF THE IMPACT BECAUSE YOU’RE HITTING WITH THE BACK OF YOUR HAND.HOW DOES YOUR TECHNIQUE NOW COMPARE TO THE WAY IT WAS WHEN YOU WERE STUDYINGWITH BRUCE?IT TOOK ME SIX MONTHS TO GET THE FEEL OF IT. AND THEN IT TOOK ME ALL THESE YEARSTO REFINE IT. AT THE BEGINNING, I STILL HAD TO THINK. NOW I DON’T THINK WHEN IHIT. NOW I UNDERSTAND WHAT HE MEANT BY, “I DO NOT HIT. IT HITS ALL BY ITSELF.”IT TAKES YEARS TO UNDERSTAND THE TECHNIQUE, ALL THE SMALL DETAILS, AND HOW TOUSE IT. YOU CAN THROW ALL SORTS OF PUNCHES AGAINST PIECES OF PAPER, MITTS, ANDBAGS. IT WON’T DO YOU ANY GOOD UNLESS YOU CAN JUDGE THE DISTANCE WITH A MOVINGTARGET. THAT SKILL ONLY COMES WITH ACTUAL APPLICATION. THAT’S WHY BRUCE ALWAYSEMPHASIZED SPARRING. THAT’S HOW HE HONED THE TECHNIQUE. AT THE BEGINNING, THEFEELING COMES FROM TWO THINGS. THE FIRST IS THE MECHANICS AND THE SEQUENCE OFMOTION. YOU CAN FEEL EVERY BODY PART MOVING, EVERY JOINT. THAT TAKES A LONG TIMETO LEARN. THE THREE-POINT LANDING, YOU HAVE TO FEEL. THE FIST HAS TO LAND FIRST,THE FRONT LEG, THEN THE BACK LEG. THEN YOU CAN’T REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT UNTILYOU CAN APPLY IT BY SPARRING. WHEN YOU START TO SPAR, THAT’S A WHOLE NEWBALLGAME. BRUCE SAID THAT BEING ABLE TO HIT AN OPPONENT WITH A GOOD COMBINATIONIS SATISFYING, BUT IF YOU CAN HIT THE TARGET WITH ONE SHOT, THEN THAT’S A SIGNOF GREATNESS. THE FRONT HAND LEAD GIVES YOU THAT. YOU NEED TIMING, DISTANCE, TOBE NONTELEGRAPHIC, FOOTWORK.CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THE POSITION OF THE FRONT HAND AND THEVARIATIONS?TO BE FAST, YOU WANT TO USE THE GUNSIGHT. IF YOU WATCH BRUCE LEE’S HAND, IT’SLIKE THIS HERE [DEMONSTRATES]. IF YOUR HAND IS POINTED DOWN, THEN YOUR HAND HASTO COME UP BEFORE YOU CAN AIM AT THE TARGET. SO, IF YOU REALLY WANT TO HITSOMEBODY QUICKLY, YOU WANT TO USE THE GUNSIGHT. BUT THEN AGAIN, YOU NEED TOLEARN HOW TO HIT WITH YOUR HAND UP OR DOWN. IN JKD, WE HAVE THREE RANGES—LONG,MIDDLE, AND CLOSE. LONG RANGE IS LIKE KICKING DISTANCE. THE MIDDLE RANGE ISWHERE YOU THROW THE LEAD AND USE COMBINATIONS. AT CLOSE RANGE, YOU CAN USETRAPPING AND BENT-ARM PUNCHING. AT LONG RANGE, YOU KEEP THE HAND DOWN. YOU MOVEBETTER WITH THAT HAND DOWN, AND YOU CAN SEE YOUR OPPONENT BETTER. ALSO, BRUCEUSED TO SAY IF HIS HAND WAS DOWN HE COULD HOOK, UPPERCUT, THROW LOW OR HIGH.THAT’S WHY HE PREFERRED IT THAT WAY. IT’S ALSO LESS THREATENING, SO IT’S LIKEATTACK BY DRAWING. BUT YOU HAVE TO FIRST LEARN HOW TO THROW A STRAIGHT LEAD WITHTHE HAND UP, FROM WHAT I’D CALL THE STANDARD STANCE. BUT ONCE YOU HAVE MOBILITY,FOOTWORK, AND UPPER BODY EVASION, YOU DON’T HAVE TO KEEP THE HAND UP. THE BETTERBOXERS DO THAT. BOXERS THAT HAVE GOOD UPPER BODY MOVEMENT AND FOOTWORK DON’TKEEP THEIR FRONT HAND UP. KEEPING THAT FRONT HAND DOWN GIVES YOU BETTER BALANCE.IT KEEPS THAT EXTRA WEIGHT LOWER.WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BOXING AND JKD?WHAT MAKES JKD DIFFERENT FROM BOXING IS THE RANGE. IN BOXING THE RANGE IS I CANTOUCH YOU, AND YOU CAN TOUCH ME. IN JKD, IT’S A HALF-STEP BACK. I CAN TOUCH YOU,BUT YOU CANNOT TOUCH ME. WHEN WE ATTACK, THOUGH, WE HAVE TO COVER GROUND WITHTHE PUSH-OFF TO REACH YOU. BUT IF YOU DON’T TRAIN THAT WAY, YOU JUST STEP IN TOCOVER DISTANCE. ALSO THE FRONT HAND LEAD IS MORE LIKE A SINGLE STRAIGHT THRUST.IT’S THE MOST DIFFICULT ATTACK IN FENCING. AND THE STRAIGHT LEAD IS THE MOSTDIFFICULT ATTACK IN JKD. IT’S A VERY UNNATURAL THING TO DO, BECAUSE THE HANDMOVES BEFORE THE FEET. WHEN YOU WALK, THE HANDS AND FEET MOVE AT THE SAME TIME.WITH THE STRAIGHT LEAD, YOU ALSO HAVE TO COVER GREATER DISTANCE, SO YOU HAVE TOHAVE THE FOOTWORK, THE PUSH-OFF.WHY DON’T WE SEE BOXERS STRAIGHT PUNCHING TODAY?GOOD QUESTION. BOXING’S MORE LIKE ENTERTAINMENT NOW. PEOPLE WOULD GET BOREDWATCHING SOMEONE HIT AND NOT GET HIT. THEY WANT TO SEE BLOOD, KNOCKOUTS, TOE TOTOE. IT’S BECOME A STYLE. THEY GOT USED TO TRAINING THE WAY THEY DO. TODAYBOXERS ARE PHYSICALLY STRONGER AND FASTER. THEIR CONDITIONING MAKES UP FOR NOTHAVING THE ADVANTAGES OF A STRAIGHT LEAD. SOME BOXERS, LIKE ALI AND DE LA HOYA,DO HAVE A GOOD JAB, BUT THEY ARE NOT PUNCHING LIKE THE OLD TIMERS—NOT LIKEBRUCE, WITH THE THUMBS UP. YOU CANNOT APPLY THE THUMBS UP STRUCTURE WITH TODAY’SBOXING STANCE, WHICH IS MORE SWING-ORIENTED. THE STRAIGHT LEAD IS A LONG-RANGEPUNCH. THE STRAIGHT LEAD HAS BECOME SOMETHING OF A LOST ART. IT TAKES A LONGTIME TO CULTIVATE. PEOPLE GET FRUSTRATED. THEY DON’T UNDERSTAND THE PRINCIPLE ORTHE STRUCTURE BEHIND IT. STRAIGHT HITTING HAS BECOME A FORGOTTEN ART. IF BRUCELEE WERE ALIVE TODAY, I THINK HE’D AGREE THAT BOXING REALLY HASN’T IMPROVED. INFACT, IT’S REGRESSED. DEMPSEY AND DRISCOLL WERE SAYING THAT IN THE ’20S.WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES THE STRAIGHT SO DIFFICULT? WOULD YOU SAY IT’S THE MOSTDIFFICULT TECHNIQUE IN JKD?YES. LOOK AT NADI’S BOOK. HE SAYS THE SINGLE, STRAIGHT THRUST IS THE MOSTDIFFICULT TECHNIQUE IN FENCING. SO THE TYPICAL FRONT HAND LEAD IN JKD IS,ACCORDING TO BRUCE LEE, THE MOST DIFFICULT TECHNIQUE IN JKD. THE FENCING SINGLE,STRAIGHT THRUST AND THE JEET KUNE DO STRAIGHT LEAD PARALLEL EACH OTHER. IT’SEASY TO THROW A BENT-ARM PUNCH AND SWING. WHEN MEN FIRST START TO PUNCH, IT’SNOT A STRAIGHT PUNCH. THROWING A STRAIGHT PUNCH IS DIFFICULT AND REQUIRES MORESCIENCE TO IT. WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID, AND I WANTED TO FIGHT, THE FIRST THING IDID WAS JUST TO SWING. THE STRAIGHT PUNCH CAME LATE IN FISTIC HISTORY. ITREQUIRED MORE SCIENCE. THAT’S WHY BRUCE LEE LIKED IT. THAT’S WHY IT’S DIFFICULT.IF IT WAS EASY, EVERYBODY WOULD BE USING IT. THE JEET KUNE DO STRAIGHT PUNCH ISAN EDUCATED PUNCH. IT TAKES UNDERSTANDING OF BODY ALIGNMENT, LEVERAGE. SWINGINGIS EASY. EVERYBODY CAN THROW A SWING. BUT TO THROW A STRAIGHT PUNCH TAKESEDUCATION AND UNDERSTANDING.DID BRUCE EVER TALK ABOUT THE DIFFICULTY OF STRAIGHT PUNCHING?OH YEAH, BECAUSE MOST SCHOOLS CANNOT COMPREHEND THE PRINCIPLES OF THAT PUNCH.MOST PEOPLE CANNOT GET A GOOD FEELING THROWING IT. SO WHEN I STARTED TEACHINGIT, PEOPLE WOULD GIVE UP. SOME PEOPLE SAID, “OH, IT WON’T WORK.” THEY THINK THEYCAN’T GET POWER FROM IT. IT TAKES A LOT OF PRACTICE. AS YOU START TO DO ITCORRECTLY, LITTLE BY LITTLE, YOU’LL START TO GET POWER.N O T E S1 TED WONG WITH JOHN LITTLE, BRUCE LEE’S LEAD PUNCH: TED WONG EXPLAINS JUN FANJEET KINE DO’S MOST EXPLOSIVE TECHNIQUE!
