How could he use theword, “Fighting” compatible with “Peaceful Philosophy”?Can “kung fu” be replaced by the words “Justice” “Love” “Peace” “Way” or“Buddha’s Truth”?Anyway, you can see “The Resurrection of the Dragon” in this book.

His father was an actor in Hong Kong and was on tourin San Francisco, U.S. where Bruce Lee was born. Once returning to Hong Kong, hebecame a child actor in Hong Kong movies by the stage name Li Xiaolong. Whileenrolled at the University of Washington, he became fixated on martial artswhich led him to creating his own original form of martial art, Jeet Kune Do.His fighting skills attracted Hollywood’s attention and he became an action starin American TV shows. In 1971, he returned to Hong Kong to act in the movie,Fists of Fury. Afterward, he achieved his dream of acting in a Hollywood movieby starring in Enter the Dragon. However, he was bothered by severe headachesfor an unknown reason and, in July 1973, right before the release of his movie,suddenly passed away.

We would like to summon the spirit of the famous Bruce Lee, the kung fumovie actor.He is still famous worldwide. I knew him in my high school days, and he died in1973. But after his death, he became famous through his movies. Even in Japan, alot of his followers still respect him, especially people who are directing kungfu, martial arts or karate-like area, and actors and actresses. These peoplehave deep, deep respect for him.So today, we must investigate how he has been in the afterlife or spiritualworld. When I wrote The Mystical Laws[2] [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ref_en02] Iwrote that the famous Bruce Lee might have dropped into not the heavenly worldbecause I’ve heard from people that after his death, he appeared as a ghost andthey said at that time, he smelled bad. In the context of Chinese tradition, howgood they smell is very essential. When they smell bad, it means the person isin Hell. But today, we are living in 2017, 44 years from his death. So, is hissituation the same or not? We cannot be sure about it, so we want to check it.But firstly, I must apologize to you. I cannot show the action of Bruce Lee infront of you because of my poor action now. So, it’s difficult for me. It wouldmean my death, so I cannot.Today’s purpose is, we want to know the spirit of Jeet Kune Do. The founder isBruce Lee. So, he has a philosophy regarding kung fu, especially his kung fu.Firstly, he was the disciple of famous Ip Man,[3][../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ref_en03] the grand master of Eishunken [Wing Chun]sector. Ip Man is very famous. Ip Man is Bruce Lee’s shifu [fatherly master],but he was poor at making money and making the name of Eishunken prevail.Contrary to that, Bruce Lee was very good at making money [especially after hisdeath] and he became famous in the world. So, through his famous movies, hebecame the hero of the movie world.Here, I have several movies, for example, The Big Boss; this one is Dragon KikiIppatsu in Japanese [laughs]. Fist of Fury, or Dragon Ikari no Tekken [laughs],The Way of the Dragon, or Doragon e no Michi, Game of Death, or Shibo Yugi, andTower of Death, or Shibo no Tou [see Figure 1].Young people are not familiar with Bruce Lee. [While showing the Blu-ray disccases.] This is his face, what he looks like. I’m sorry I cannot show yousomething. If I’m Dragon Li Xiaolong, I can kick the ceiling of this room[laughs] [but I’m not], so I’m very sorry about that.[../Images/figure01.jpg]HE IS AN ORIENTAL HERO, EVEN NOWRYUHO OKAWA:OK. Is it enough on him? OK, OK, OK. I’ll add an additional one.He learned kung fu, but his original Jeet Kune Do is quite different. Itsconcept is made up from a lot of martial arts, Judo, boxing or things like that.So, the form of Jeet Kune Do is quite contrary to that of common kung fu. Hisshifu, Ip Man, taught him Eishunken. It’s some kind of defensive-type kung fu.But his Jeet Kune Do is an aggressive one. I think so. It seems like kickboxingor something like that.He became famous through his movies, but to our regret, he died at the age of32. He died too young. After his death, maybe Moeyo Doragon [Enter the Dragon]became famous in the world and he became a worldwide star. Before that, heappeared in the U.S. TV series, Green Hornet, as a karate actor for a characterwith a Japanese name, Kato, and became a great star.His death is a riddle now. After his death, several movies regarding his lifestory were made, and even now, people know his famous, how do I say,dragon-bird-like voice, “Acho! Acho!” or [laughs] his nunchaku, so he really isthe origin of the kung fu movie stars. We now have Jackie Chan, Jet Li or peoplelike that, but he’s the first one of the Oriental superstars, and was and is ahero of the Oriental world. I think so.Then, I’ll summon Bruce Lee.He was born in the U.S.A., and of course, he had citizenship of the UnitedStates. But before the age of one, he returned to Hong Kong and in his youngerdays, he acted as a small movie star because his father was an actor of HongKong. After he became 19 years old, he entered the University of Washington andmajored in philosophy, so his Jeet Kune Do kung fu has a philosophical aspect.He has pride in that aspect. So today, we must ask him about his philosophy andwhat he thinks of China, Hong Kong, Japan, or the U.S.A. This is today’ssubject. I think so.I’m not sure if he can speak Japanese or not, but firstly, we’ll start inEnglish and then we can pursue his past life. Is it OK?OK, then, famous actor Bruce Lee.Would you come down here to Happy Science?I am very sorry for making you wait three weeks.You came to meBefore the Tokyo Dome lecture,[4] [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ref_en04]But I let you wait more than three weeks.I’m very sorry.Would you please speak something for us?[About 10 seconds of silence.]BRUCE LEE APPEARS, SHOWING OFF HIS MOVESBRUCE LEE:[Suddenly thrusts right hand forward, turns sideways and sticks up left indexfinger next to face, as if taking a Jeet Kune Do stance.] Tou!!MASAYUKI ISONO:Hello?BRUCE LEE:Acho![Interviewers laugh.]BRUCE LEE:[While slowly making various hand movements.] Oooh … Ko!ISONO:Hello.BRUCE LEE:Huh … Hello!ISONO:Are you Mr. Bruce Lee?BRUCE LEE:Sure.

Bad people of the world.ISONO:Bad people? For example?BRUCE LEE:Hmm?

Ah …ISONO:So, you are still in this world and fighting that kind of evil people?BRUCE LEE:Are you good people?ISONO:Yes, we are.BRUCE LEE:[Points to Sakai.] He is questionable.SAKAI:Good people, good people.BRUCE LEE:Really?SAKAI:Yes.“MY SPIRIT IS MY BODY AND MY BODY IS MY SPIRIT”BRUCE LEE:Oh!

I want to fight him.WADA:I think my father would lose against you. Actually, he is a very big fan. And …[Bruce Lee stands up and throws a kick toward Isono with right leg.] I think youare going to hurt yourself, so please sit down [laughs].BRUCE LEE:OK.SAKAI:Why did you come?BRUCE LEE:Naked is beautiful [gesturing his urge to take off jacket].WADA:The jacket you have on right now is beautiful.SAKAI:Why did you come to our Master?BRUCE LEE:Your Master?SAKAI:Why?BRUCE LEE:Ryuho Okawa is a kung fu master, so …SAKAI:Kung fu master?BRUCE LEE:I came here to fight with him.

Are you OK?ISONO:Yes, I am OK.BRUCE LEE:Do you have a problem in your brain?ISONO:No, not at all.BRUCE LEE:Oh, then it’s OK.ISONO:I asked because you said “to express yourself is your spirit or spirit of JeetKune Do.” That’s why I asked you, “Who do you think you are?” or “Who are you?”BRUCE LEE:“Who are you?” It’s a Zen mondo-like [Zen dialogue-like] question.ISONO:Yeah, it’s kind of like Zen-mondo, but you are a seeker of the Truth, so maybeyou have an answer?BRUCE LEE:Yeah.

Emptiness is the Truth. Vacancy is very important. Never think anything. Beempty!ISONO:You said in the film, Enter the Dragon, or Moeyo Doragon, “Don’t think, feel.”Is that the same meaning?BRUCE LEE:Ah, don’t fear. Don’t think about fear! Oh, yeah, it’s a great enemy. Fear!ISONO:No, no, no, I …BRUCE LEE:Fear! Fear is the entity of the devil!ISONO:Sorry, my pronunciation was bad.BRUCE LEE:Hmm?ISONO:I said, “Don’t think, feel.”BRUCE LEE:Ah!

Hot [fanning himself using the Blu-ray disc case]. Hot, hotter,hottest. India or Thailand. OK, OK. Your question is?WADA:You were talking about the spirit of Jeet Kune Do. I would like to ask about theorigins of your style. I heard it started with street fighting and then youincorporated …BRUCE LEE:Good English!WADA:Thank you, Master Okawa has trained me well.BRUCE LEE:You are like an American speaking English …ISONO:Actually, she is a …WADA:I am American.BRUCE LEE:You are American!? You’re American like me?WADA:Yes. Yes.BRUCE LEE:Oh, OK, OK, OK.WADA:I also lived in San Francisco, so …BRUCE LEE:Oh, OK, OK. San Francisco English is good English. Yeah, it’s OK.WADA:You incorporated traditional martial arts as well as boxing …BRUCE LEE:Oh, good pronunciation!WADA:And fencing …BRUCE LEE:Oh, beautiful, beautiful! [Mimics Wada.] “Martial arts!” Ohoho. Yeah, good!WADA:And also dancing [laughs]. How did you incorporate all these different fieldsinto your martial arts and make it your own style?BRUCE LEE:Hmm … My father was an actor, this is one thing. And traditional Chinese people,since the 19th century, used to learn kung fu to defend their or our country. Wehad been intruded by European people. Kung fu means, for example, Japanese Joi[meaning “expelling foreigners”]. So, at that time, a man of courage must learnkung fu.I was a disciple of famous Ip Man and I made a lot of propaganda of kung fu. Ithad been the pride of the Chinese people, especially the Hong Kong people, andincluding Chinese Americans. I also succeeded in getting a lot of Japanese fans.In the movie world, I overcame karate martial arts or Judo, so kung fu isworldwide through movies.In this point only, we can make great victory against white people. We must havesomething great. We must find some greatness in our traditional culture. Thiswas kung fu.I rebuilt the kung fu tradition and set up a new type of kung fu. It’s Jeet KuneDo. It’s the world’s most beautiful and strongest martial arts, I think. It’salso the strongest one and the most beautiful art of human beings. So, here wecan find real strength and real beauty, and here we can achieve the Truth.What is the Truth? It is the criterion which divides good and evil, or God anddevils. You know? From the standpoint of justice, we must destroy the badpeople. You must be strong. You know? You know? You know? Happy Science and JeetKune Do are almost the same. [Slowly turning around on the chair as he showssome Jeet Kune Do moves.] Woo … Poo. Woo.ON THE STRENGTH, CONFIDENCE, AND JUSTICE OF MARTIAL ARTISTSWADA:You talked about fighting for justice in this world. Would you say that there isa strong relationship between martial arts and religion?BRUCE LEE:Religion is the teaching of the heart. How to shape up a pure mind and how toget spirituality in your life. This is religion, the way of religion. It’s thesame.WADA:I have watched my father practice aikido since I was very young and I alwayswondered what sort of role the martial artists play in this world. What’s theirmission?BRUCE LEE:You mean roll?WADA:Role. Like the martial artists …BRUCE LEE:Oh, San Francisco roll [he may be referring to California roll, a type ofsushi]?WADA:Like the mission of a martial artist.BRUCE LEE:Mission? Mission. Mission. OK. Mission. To kill … oh, no. To destroy or knockdown evil people. If you’re getting stronger and stronger, you can be confidentin yourself. At that time, you can be stronger and you can keep justice in yourlife.WADA:I watched a documentary about you and you were confident to the point where youseemed a little arrogant. Where does your self-confidence come from? Or, how canwe build self-confidence?BRUCE LEE:That is the way. The true way is nothing. Nothing is vacancy. Vacancy isemptiness. Emptiness is the Truth. Truth is the world. [Spreads arms up in theair, turns around while sitting on the chair, and gradually speaks in an excitedway.] World is peace. Peace is universe …ISONO:Please calm …BRUCE LEE:Universe is, haha, everything! We are in the universe!"},{"pageContent":"3TAOISM AND FREEDOM BELIEVED BY BRUCE LEEASIAN PEOPLE CAN CONQUER THEIR INFERIORITY COMPLEX TOWARD WHITE PEOPLE BYTRAININGWADA:I would like to ask you about your career in Hollywood.BRUCE LEE:[Looks at Wada’s face.] Oh, beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. Miss beautiful.WADA:[Laughs.]BRUCE LEE:Beautiful.WADA:OK. You were a Hollywood actor and I think you said in the documentary that itwas very difficult to get leading roles in movies because of the discriminationor prejudice against Asian people.BRUCE LEE:Asian people. Discrimination against the Asian people.WADA:How did you overcome such discrimination to pursue your career?BRUCE LEE:Martial arts or Japanese bushido. These two ways have one purpose, I mean, theAsian people are smaller than the white people. The white people have much pridein their style, I mean they’re tall and rich in muscle. They think that proboxing is the strongest sport in the world and it’s a symbol of the whitepeople’s strength.But in Asia, we have kung fu or bushido. Bushido is a different one, so forexample, kung fu. If the person who performs kung fu is a small person, or asmall man or woman and a slender person, this kind of small, slender person candefeat a great, big, white champion-like boxer or … as you know, Trump, Mr.Trump, the president. The president is big, but if a small Asian fights withkung fu, Mr. Trump will be knocked down in 60 seconds, I think, one minute orso. It’s the starting point of conquering the inferiority complex of the Asianpeople, I think.The starting point is how to control your mind and how to make discipline everyday, become a confident man or woman and believe in yourself that we havesomething stronger or we have something more important in us than the spirit ofwhite people or the muscle of white people. So, we are equal in this meaning.Training conquers everything. Not by nature, but by training we can win and wecan conquer everything.TAOISM IS THE TRUTH OF THE WORLDISONO:You are a great martial artist and great philosopher, I think.BRUCE LEE:Uh-huh.ISONO:Because you studied philosophy at university and you studied a wide variety ofphilosophies from eastern philosophy like Chinese Lao-tzu or Chuang-tzu …BRUCE LEE:[Performing some moves as he listens, and reacts to the name Lao-tzu.] Lao-tzu,ah, Lao-tzu is good.ISONO:… yes, to western philosophy. What kind of philosophy helped you to succeed?BRUCE LEE:Taoism is good.ISONO:Taoism?BRUCE LEE:Yeah, good. Taoism is good. White is black. Black is white. That is the trueexplanation … that is the Truth of the world. The world’s phenomenon is,something is black while something is white. Black and white make up this world.We cannot live in the white world only or the black world only. We live throughthese two colored worlds. You must know.But choose white. If you look at the black world, but go straight, then afterthat, you can find the white world. In this meaning, “white” doesn’t mean thewhite people. It just means innocent. I mean innocent. Goodness. “Black” meansevil or contaminated. I mean that. People sometimes are contaminated by evilthinking, evil tradition, evil culture, or Hitler-like thinking. But we can bewhite from black. Black sometimes turns out to be white.Taoism is the Truth. It’s the Truth. [While drawing a big imaginary wave withboth hands.] [see Figure 2.] Our life is like the wave, so sometimes we are inthe bottom of the wave and sometimes we are in the upmost point of the wave.Devils usually attack us when we are at the top of the wave. Also, devils attackus when we are in the depths of the wave, but at the same time, angels come tosave us. So, the top of the wave and the bottom of the wave, these two pointshave the truth, in this wavelength, as you know.Can you understand?

Lao-tzu. Lao-tzu.ISONO:Lao-tzu? So, Lao-tzu guided you spiritually?BRUCE LEE:Taoism is my real spiritual parent. I’m the son of Taoism.ISONO:I think you are also influenced by Buddhism.BRUCE LEE:Ah, of course, of course. Lao-tzu and Buddha have almost the same direction ofthinking. Buddha taught us, “We have the chance to become Buddha because we haveBuddha-nature in us. So, we need spiritual training.” Sometimes we need somekind of physical training, even in Buddhism.Taoism is a little different, but Taoism also has training. The training is howyou feel the energy of the universe. [Gesturing with both hands.] Energy of theuniverse, you gather that kind of energy from the universe within you, and berelaxed. After that, you concentrate [stands up] and attack! [Throws a punchtoward Isono. Isono leans back. Bruce Lee sits back down.] That is the Truth.FREEDOM MEANS TO BE FREE FROM PHYSICAL BONDAGEISONO:Thank you for your precious lesson. I would also like to ask, what is trueliberty?BRUCE LEE:Liberty?ISONO:Yes. Freedom.BRUCE LEE:Ah, liberty. Liberty Island.ISONO:No, not Liberty Island [laughs].BRUCE LEE:Liberty. Hmm. Ah, goddess, the Goddess of Liberty [Statue of Liberty]. I know, Iknow.ISONO:Yes.BRUCE LEE:What’s that? What’s the problem?ISONO:No, no.BRUCE LEE:It’s … ah, the Goddess of Liberty. Ah, uh-huh. In that, it’s empty. Emptiness.There is emptiness. Yeah, it’s true.ISONO:So, in your teachings, liberty means empty?BRUCE LEE:No, no.ISONO:No?BRUCE LEE:Freedom first.ISONO:Freedom first?BRUCE LEE:Freedom. Please set your body free. Set your … ah, your spirit. Please set yourspirit free from your bondage, it means your physical condition. This is thetrue you, yourself."},{"pageContent":"4CHINA, JAPAN, AND NORTH KOREA AS ANALYZED BY BRUCE LEEBRUCE LEE SPREAD THE CHINESE SPIRIT TO THE WORLD THROUGH KUNG FUWADA:You seem to have a very philosophical side to you. Why did you pursue a careeras an actor? You were already a prominent figure in the world of martial arts.BRUCE LEE:The Chinese people have a 5,000-year history. They are proud of that history.But since the war between China and Europe, in 1840 or so, we have beendestroyed by European pragmatism. It’s technology regarding war.But the Chinese people need some symbol like a flag. For example, the Americanflag or the flag which was held by the Goddess of Freedom, like that. I’m aflag. I am the flag and I am the symbol. I’m the hero of the Chinese people. Notonly the Chinese people, but also the American people, the Japanese people,other Asian people or European people loved me and admired me a lot. It’s onekind of patriotism dispatched by me, but the Chinese people need some kind ofsymbol.So, I am Paul. Paul-of-Christianity-like existence. I mean, I am Paul of kung fubecause I spread the beautiful side and the strong side of kung fu. It’s a prideof the Chinese spirit, so I spread this kind of Chinese spirit all over theworld.The Chinese people are one-fifth of the world’s population, but for a long time,they have been under, how do I say, “the inferiority complex syndrome.” So, I amthe destroyer of the inferiority complex of the Chinese. I want to be one of theavengers of the U.S.A. As you know, the U.S.A. has several heroes. I want to beone of the heroes of the Americans.But it was a little difficult, even for me. My wife was a real American citizen,but we, the Chinese, like the Japanese people, were discriminated by whiteAmericans. I sometimes said, “American people say that men are equal and we havefreedom and liberty. They say so. But it means equality belongs to white peopleand freedom and liberty also belong to white people.” They despised anddisregarded black people and yellow people. When I got married and had a baby,my mother-in-law said, “Oh, I’m going to have a yellow baby.” She said so. I wasvery sorry. I was born in America, but I was physically from China. They haddiscrimination then.So, I am the representative of the colored people. Chinese people sometimesdislike the Japanese or sometimes dislike the Korean people, but we must befriends on this point. We must say, “Our soul is equal to the white people.” Imean, white, black, and yellow are the same—they all come from God or Buddha.So, we must show something against the superiority of the white people. In mycase, this was kung fu and it got the Hollywood movies involved [see Figure 3 &4]. It’s a very popular way and an effective way for the world. What is the realChinese spirit and what is the strength of the Chinese people? This was mymission.[Speaks to Isono in a joking manner.] You asked if I’m in Heaven. It’s Japanesediscrimination against the Chinese. Please apologize to the Chinese people.[../Images/figure03.jpg]ISONO:No, I don’t mean any evil intention toward you.BRUCE LEE:Really?ISONO:Yes.WADA:It’s a question we ask many spirits regardless of their race.BRUCE LEE:Uh-huh.[../Images/figure04.jpg]MOVIES ARE A NEW WEAPONISONO:You succeeded in spreading the spirit of kung fu all over the world through yourmovies.BRUCE LEE:Uh-huh.ISONO:So, I’d like to ask about the mission of movies. What do you think is themission of movies today?BRUCE LEE:They are a new weapon for the people. I mean, if we want to know somethingthrough newspapers, we must learn how to read or write, or do difficultstudying, but when we just watch TV or movies, we can be relaxed and understandor accept something great. It’s an easy way and a popular way; spreading of theTruth by movie has ten times the power or one hundred times the power if wecompare it to writing a book or something like that, so it’s very convenient.You too, use movies more and more. It’s very convenient, and it’s easy to be ahero through movies. But the reading population cannot be so many, so it’s verydifficult.THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA WILL COLLAPSE WITHIN 10 YEARSWADA:You talked about equality amongst races, but there are many kung fu movies withstrong anti-Japanese sentiment.BRUCE LEE:Anti-Japanese, OK.WADA:Also, in China, there is a strong trend to hate Japanese people. What do youthink about that?BRUCE LEE:In my days, China’s economic power was very small. Japan was the rising sun atthat time, in my days in the 1960s or 70s. At that time, Japan was the sun inthe sky and we were just in the light of the moon.But nowadays, 40 years have passed since then. The Chinese people are gettinggreater in the economy and have military power now. But they are on the way. Ithink so. It is said that the Chinese economy is larger than the Japanese one,but in Japan, there are 10 million … no, no, 100 million people. We have morethan … I don’t know correctly, but ten times as many people as Japan. So, evenif the economic size of China is larger than the Japanese one, it does not meanthat Japan is inferior to China. Japan has an industrious mind or spirit, andJapan has been the icon of the Asian people for the last 150 years.Now, the Chinese people think that we can catch up to Japan and overcome Japanthis time. They think so, but I think it’s a little difficult. Japan is thefirst country of the Asian countries which defeated European countries, so wemust learn something more from Japan. I think so.China, Korea and Japan, these three must be friends. We must keep the friendshipand protect the Asian area from the intrusion of Anglo-Saxon people. China hasbeen intruded many, many times and only Japan could show that power. We mustlearn from each other and make a tie between us. It’s very important, I think.We are not enemies. We must be friends. I think so.SAKAI:About China, what do you think about the Communist Party of China and Xi Jinpingadministration? What do you think about it now?BRUCE LEE:About the communist party, I think China is changing greatly now. I feel a greatwave from Hong Kong and the south part of China. China is a country ofcapitalism now in reality, but they have an illusion that they belong tocommunism. It’s not true. They are living in capitalism.Japan is now going from capitalism to socialism. I think so. Japan is justseeking equality, not the growth of the economy, but equality in the result ofeconomic activity.But look at China. They are seeking wealth and they are working for their ownwealth ardently. Quite different. China is just in the Meiji period of Japan.Changing, changing, changing, changing.So, the Communist Party of China will collapse in the near future, I mean within10 years because the Chinese economic size is a very huge one. It’s competingwith the American economy. It means China will change into a capitalist country,for the Chinese people are living to earn money. As you know, they don’t havemuch intention in spiritual development, but I think, as you know, people needfood and livelihood, I mean food, house and clothes. After that, people can seeka pure spiritual living.China is just moving, so don’t think too rapidly about that. They will become aJapanese-like country and an American-like country in these 10 or 20 years. And,the beginning of capitalism, I mean the culture which allows you to get moneyfrom huge reputation, started from Bruce Lee. I’m the starting point ofcapitalism of the Hong Kong Chinese [laughs].ISONO:OK. Then, I’d like to ask about the current situation in China and Hong Kong,since we are greatly concerned about that. The Chinese government suppresses theliberty of the Chinese people and there is the “one country, two systems” policyin Hong Kong, but the Chinese government invaded and deprived the people of HongKong of their liberty. So, what do you think about the current situation?BRUCE LEE:Then, how about Duterte of the Philippines? He killed a lot because of hispolicy on drugs.ISONO:Hmm.BRUCE LEE:More than China. He killed a lot of people. Maybe seven hundred or eight hundredthousand? I’m not sure, but maybe almost one million people were killed byPresident Duterte because of drug dealers or drug users.[5][../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ref_en05] It’s more than the Chinese government, Ithink. America usually attacks Chinese policies because of the lack of humanity.It means the government puts pressure on weaker people or poor people. But now,even America cannot say like that because America itself has very muchdifference between the richest people and the poorest people. So, America isalmost the same as China.We must think about that seriously, of course. But firstly, there are the peoplewho are talented in something, for example, kung fu, being beautiful, writingbooks, teaching something or showing something, and getting great money. Afterthat, people learn from them and follow them. And after that, social welfaremust remake the country politics. I think so.As you said, China has a lot of problems, but 30 or 40 years ago, I mean in myage, in my period, almost all Chinese people were very poor at that time. Butnow, 20 or 30 percent of the Chinese people are richer than before. It’s gettingbetter and better, so just give them the time.And, a lot of Chinese people have been going abroad, especially to the UnitedStates, studying in the United States universities or getting an MBA from afamous university in the U.S.A., and returning back to China. Now, they arestill not so old; they are 20, 30, or 40 years old. But 10 or 20 years in thefuture, they will get real influence on politics, economy, and education. Then,China will change greatly. I hope so.ISONO:Does that mean you support the current Chinese government’s policies?BRUCE LEE:No. I don’t support. I just said I’m the first one.THERE WILL BE ANOTHER HERO AFTER LIU XIAOBOISONO:So next, the future generations of China will change the government or regime?BRUCE LEE:The Chinese people need a hero, and I am the hero. One part of Chinese cultureis kung fu, but there are other parts of the culture. Other heroes will appearafter me and follow me. They will continue to fight against all systems and theywill finally win. I think so.SAKAI:Do you know who Liu Xiaobo is?BRUCE LEE:I know.SAKAI:He is a hero, I think.BRUCE LEE:Uh-huh.SAKAI:What do you think about him?BRUCE LEE:He’s OK, but he is not Bruce Lee. He is before Bruce Lee. After his death, therewill appear a Bruce Lee, a political performer, and the political reformer willsucceed in the real revolution for freedom. I think so.China selected economy first and politics later. It was made in the 1980s or1990s, around then. So, economy first and politics will follow, I think. XiJinping is not so good at developing the economy, so he is just attacking thepoliticians who get a lot of money by dint of their political power. He says,“We’ll kill tigers and flies, both.”[6] [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ref_en06] Itmeans a man who has great power and a man who has small power, both who commitcrimes will be banished from the Chinese central political position. He insistsso. It’s an old style. I know it’s an old style. It’s maybe a style used beforethe Meiji Restoration, I mean the Edo period, I think. But China is, at thistime, at that level, but after that, they will change. I think so.NORTH KOREA SHOULD ASK JAPAN TO RESCUE THEMWADA:I would like to ask about North Korea.BRUCE LEE:North Korea!? Ah …WADA:Now, Mr. Trump has been threatening North Korea and the relationship between theUnited States, China and Japan is very unstable. How can we resolve this or whatdo you think about this situation?BRUCE LEE:Hmm, very complicated because the emotion of North Korean people and SouthKorean people is very confusing, I mean they are educated to hate Japanesepeople historically. But they are also taught, “America is the new intruder, sobe careful.”Especially, North Korea has no friends. The only friend is China, but China isgreatly changing now. China’s trading amount is … the China-American tradeamount is number one. So, in thinking from the standpoint of trading profit,even Xi Jinping will finally give up on North Korea.They will choose America because America, the United States, will make China awealthier country, but North Korea just says, “Give us money. Give us goods.Give us food.” It’s pity indeed, but as one of the largest countries of theworld, the Chinese top leader, even if it’s Xi Jinping or another person, willchoose what is big and what is small. They can understand the reason why.So, North Korea should change their attitude. They don’t believe that they willbe abandoned by Beijing in the near future, but in reality, Beijing will give upNorth Korea because they are bad in their behavior.Also, they are educated to look down upon Japan. But Japan is a strong countryand a very intelligent country. All over, the Japanese people can read and learna lot of knowledge. People who can read, speak, and hear Japanese language … TheJapanese language guarantees the people to become intelligent as the world’s toplevel.Even the Chinese people and the Korean people are proud that they are good atspeaking English. They are proud of that, but the Japanese people learn fromJapanese books, Japanese news, or Japanese wisdom, how to live and what theirfuture is. The Japanese people are quite contrary to the European people andother Asian people. Japan is another civilization, I think. This is very strongand a very excellent one.So, North Korea will lose two points. I mean, first, the support of Beijing.And, they must learn from Japan a lot, but they dislike it and they will losethe chance to save themselves. Japan can save North Korea, of course, but theirbehavior is very bad. So, Japan doesn’t work.The last question is, when will the United States attack North Korea, or willthey not attack? Japan is just observer-like people, but North Korea must askfor some rescue from Japan. I think so.ISONO:Thank you."},{"pageContent":"5BRUCE LEE REVEALS HIS PAST LIFE, THE TRUTH OF HIS DEATH, AND THE MISSION OF HISSOUL“I WAS A DRAGON IN EVERY TIME”SAKAI:Another question.

Wereyou able to accomplish everything you were supposed to?BRUCE LEE:No.WADA:How did you die?BRUCE LEE:[Sighs deeply.] I had an accident in my back in my twenties and I did too muchin my movies, so it must have been the direct reason of my young death.Another reason is, I had enemies which could not be seen through my human eyes.I sometimes said devils. Devils were attacking me. Devils don’t like heroes. Ahero is sometimes the assistant of God, so heroes are targeted by devils. It’slike Ryoma Sakamoto, who died too young. He died too young, the same age as whenI died. We are on the verge of losing our lives, every year, every age, andevery period.We have a mind of fushaku shimmyo,[11] [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ref_en11] ofcourse, because we are the destroyers of the old age. So, the people who protectthe old age sometimes kill us and even the devils will give powers to them. Iwas a hero from Heaven, but some devils want to destroy the Chinese new legacy,I mean the hope of the Chinese people.It is the real meaning of my young death. So, I died too young.

The following is the mechanismbehind Master Ryuho Okawa’s spiritual messages.1 — You are a spiritPeople are born into this world to gain wisdom through various experiences andreturn to the other world when their lives end. We are all spirits and repeatthis cycle in order to refine our souls.[../Images/graphic1.jpg]2 — You have a guardian spiritGuardian spirits are those who protect the people who are living on this earth.Each of us has a guardian spirit that watches over us and guides us from theother world. They were us in our past life, and are identical in how we think.[../Images/graphic2.jpg]3 — How spiritual messages workMaster Ryuho Okawa, through his enlightenment, is capable of summoning anyspirit from anywhere in the world, including the spirit world.Master Okawa’s way of receiving spiritual messages is fundamentally differentfrom that of other psychic mediums who undergo trances and are therebycompletely taken over by the spirits they are channeling. Master Okawa’sattainment of a high level of enlightenment enables him to retain full controlof his consciousness and body throughout the duration of the spiritual message.To allow the spirits to express their own thoughts and personalities freely,however, Master Okawa usually softens the dominancy of his consciousness. Thisway, he is able to keep his own philosophies out of the way and ensure that thespiritual messages are pure expressions of the spirits he is channeling.Since guardian spirits think at the same subconscious level as the person livingon earth, Master Okawa can summon the spirit and find out what the person onearth is actually thinking. If the person has already returned to the otherworld, the spirit can give messages to the people living on earth through MasterOkawa.Since 2009, more than 700 sessions of spiritual messages have been openlyrecorded by Master Okawa, and the majority of these have been published.Spiritual messages from the guardian spirits of people living today such asDonald Trump, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chinese President XiJinping, as well as spiritual messages sent from the spirit world by JesusChrist, Muhammad, Thomas Edison, Mother Teresa, Steve Jobs and Nelson Mandelaare just a tiny pack of spiritual messages that were published so far.Domestically, in Japan, these spiritual messages are being read by a wide rangeof politicians and mass media, and the high-level contents of these books aredelivering an impact even more on politics, news and public opinion. In recentyears, there have been spiritual messages recorded in English, and Englishtranslations are being done on the spiritual messages given in Japanese.
