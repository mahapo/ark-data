[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" Kenpo Techniques \"Its not who's right, but who's left.\" Ed Parker Kenpo techniques are groups of basic moves arranged in a pre-planned sequence to illustrate a possible defense for a given scenario. They are taught with the \"Three phase concept\" which views the techniques in 3 stages (phases): Ideal, What-if, and Formulation. In a \"real world\" situation, the Kenpo practitioner isn't expected to complete a whole specific technique. One never knows exactly how an opponent may react to any block, check or strike. For any given technique one can apply the equation formula to fit the reactions of their opponent, or perhaps the practitioner has a comfort level with certain movement and prefers to use the basics with which they are the most capable. Some people believe that the techniques are the heart of Kenpo. They are. Unfortunately, too many people lose sight of why. Always remember, the techniques are vehicles for learning the principles of Kenpo. That is their lesson."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Kenpo Techniques Table of Contents i Table of Contents Concepts ....................................................................................................................... ... 3 The Three Phas e Concept ................................................................................................. 3 Equation Formula ........................................................................................................... 3 Required Techniques For Ye llow Belt ............................................................................... 1 Optional Te chniques ........................................................................................................ 3 Required Techniques For Orange Belt .............................................................................. 6 Optional Te chniques ...................................................................................................... 10 Required Techniques For Pu rple Belt .............................................................................. 14 Optional Te chniques ...................................................................................................... 18 Required Techniques For Blue Belt ................................................................................. 21 Optional Te chniques ...................................................................................................... 26 Required Techniques For Green Belt .............................................................................. 29 Optional Te chniques ...................................................................................................... 33 Required Techniques For Ad v Green Belt ........................................................................ 36 Optional Te chniques ...................................................................................................... 42 Required Techniques For 3rd Brown Belt ....................................................................... 46 Optional Te chniques ...................................................................................................... 54 Required Techniques For 2nd Brown Belt ....................................................................... 56 Required Techniques For 1s t Brown Belt ........................................................................ 63 Optional Te chniques ...................................................................................................... 71 Required Techniques For 1st Black Belt ......................................................................... 74 Optional Te chniqu es ...................................................................................................... 82 "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Kenpo Techniques Concepts ii Concepts The Three-Phase Concept Kenpo techniques are taught with a three phas e formula where the student is expected to learn the technique as written [ in stone of course :-) ], then go on to play with the possibilities. The Three Phases are, in order, the following: Ideal Phase In the Ideal Phase the student learns the techni que \"by the book\". This means the attack is specified, the defense is applied and the attackers reaction is known. What-If Phase In the What-If Phase the studen t(s) experiment with different possible scenarios for the attack and attackers reactions. Formulation Phase With the Formulation Phase the student tears ap art the technique, expl ores its principles and develops alternate, spontaneou s, reactions all with the aid the equation formula. Equation Formula The Equation Formula for fighting was desi gned as a formula to allow fighters to build/design logical and practical fighting techni ques. It states that for any base move (ie punch/kick) or group of moves (technique - ie Delayed Sword) one may modify their intention by: 1. Alter the target area, weapon, or both. 2. Prefix a strike or block with an off angl e body positioning (ie step out of the way of the weapon!). 3. Perhaps Suffix your strike with one or several more. 4. Rearrange the order of a technique. Inst ead of block-chop-punch change it to block- punch-chop (don’t forget to block though :-)). 5. Insert a move, perhaps simultaneously , such as a check of another weapon. 6. Delete a move to prevent unwanted injury to yourself, your oppo nent or to prevent unnecessary time spent engaging and less time leaving! 7. You may wish to adjust the range or angle of the weapon. 8. Regulate your weapons speed or force an d you may get a very different reaction."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Kenpo Techniques Required Techniques For Yellow Belt 1 Required Techniques For Yellow Belt 1.
