Following his usual routine, he dug the pit,stacked the firewood, arranged the rocks, and spread the banana leaves. Thebarbecue’s pyre ascended high over his backyard fence, quickly igniting a flurryof 9-1-1 calls on rotary dials. And like clockwork the Alameda Fire Departmentsent an engine over just as the rich aroma began to pervade Eagle Avenue.Their inspection, however, was little more than a formality. Wally had beenhosting his giant luau parties twice a year for almost a decade now, and thefiremen from nearby Station 3 had long since become accustomed to the massiveHawaiian barbecue that preceded the event.Fire Chief William Hilbish had even become chummy with Wally over the years,noticing that the jujitsu master seemed to exude nothing but humility and goodmanners. For someone with a reputation for tossing grown men about like ragdolls on the mat, Wally appeared to be a gentle soul. Besides, Hilbish’s guyswere always fascinated to see the island-style earth-oven blazing away in aneighborhood yard.“All right, Wally [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt2], we’ll see you in six months,”Hilbish said, as he departed alongside the training studio at the rear of thehouse. “Enjoy your luau.”In the frenzy [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt3] of last-minute preparations at the Jayresidence, the firefighters were hardly noticed. Wally’s wife, Bernice, wasseveral days into self-catering a small mountain of food out of her tinykitchen: huge trays of chicken long rice, ten-gallon pots of poi, platters oflomi lomi salmon, and a tropical orchard’s worth of sliced pineapple. She handedthese dishes off for delivery as soon as they were ready, grabbing whichever oftheir children or students were passing through the kitchen at the time andordering them to load everything into the family station wagon for delivery tothe luau’s venue, at nearby Colombo Hall.Even in the bustle [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt4], Wally remained excited. Hissummer luau was looking to draw upward of a thousand partygoers, and the bigturnout boded well for his judo students and their next excursion to competeabroad. Wally always used the party’s ticket-sale revenue to take his studentsaround the hemisphere for tournaments, tightly packing them all into his stationwagon (at present, loaded heavy with platters of teriyaki lingcod) and drivingthem around North America to compete against whoever invited them out for amatch. His team cleaned up straight through to Vancouver on their trip theprevious spring, and Wally was itching to get them out again.Not that he was surprised by the high ticket sales. Wally knew the second hebooked “Hawaii’s Songbird” Lena Machado to sing at his luau that she would drawa considerable crowd. After her celebrated [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt5]performances at the San Francisco World’s Fair in ’39, her soaring falsetto drewBay Area Hawaiians like an islander incarnation of the Pied Piper.Better yet for Wally [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt6], his buddy James Lee hadarranged for a special martial arts guest to come down from Seattle to perform.And that prospect was shaping up to be every bit as exciting as hearing Machadosing. Over the last few years, the martial arts demonstrations had become a bigpart of the luau entertainment, and this friend of theirs from Seattle . . .well . . . Wally knew the kid to be a showstopper.Leo Fong drove [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt7] south from Vallejo along I-80 in hismetallic green Ford Fairlane, as the late day summer sun glimmered in gold rushhues on the water of San Francisco Bay. Further out toward the horizon, a vastfog was gathering on the Pacific, threatening to move inland and impose itsgrayness on the glow of the Golden Gate. The Bay Area was nothing if notatmospheric, and after growing up in Arkansas, Fong still regularly marveled atthe California scenery.Merging onto 24 toward Oakland, Fong thought of how his parish reassignment fromSacramento to Vallejo had cut down so heavily on his commute times, just as howhis departure from Chinatown to study with James Lee in the East Bay kept himfrom suffering Bay Bridge traffic. Fong had been traveling to San Francisco forkung fu lessons for the past few years, first at Hung Sing off of PortsmouthSquare, and then at Kin Mon, up on Waverly. These days he was making the weeklytrip to practice in James’s garage, out toward the Oakland foothills.Unlike most practitioners of the time, Fong did not derive his martial artsidentity from any one particular school or method. Even as his foundation was inAmerican boxing, Fong had studied jujitsu, taekwondo, and a variety of kung fustyles since moving to California. Still, he felt inclined to keep looking andexperimenting, to continue chasing down some sort of “ultimate” fighting style.It was in this regard that he had found a like-minded mentor in James Lee, whowas almost ten years his senior, but one of the more forward-thinking martialartists he had met. Not only did James share Fong’s interest in various styles,but he was always proactively on the lookout for technique that could proveeffective in a street fight. Whereas Fong grew up beating back the racism ofcorn-fed Ozark boys, James had made a name for himself fighting on theblue-collar streets of Oakland. Different worlds, sure, but they both understoodthe stark and spontaneous nature of real fighting.Fong’s schedule limited him to only a weekly practice session in Oakland, butthe second he arrived James would excitedly convey something new that he hadcome across that week. Like Fong, James didn’t have firm allegiance to aparticular style or system but rather always put the emphasis oneffectiveness—“Does it work?” The new techniques he related were alwayssomething viable, something that could prove worthwhile in a street fight: astreamlined type of kick or a viciously effective choke hold.It was one of those zealous reports from James that now had Fong on the road toOakland for Wally Jay’s luau, though to check out not a fighting technique butan individual fighter. Fong was somewhat indifferent to the invitation at first,but he was won over by James’s enthusiastic descriptions of the guy slated toperform at the luau: some twenty-year-old martial arts dynamo from Seattle.Some kid named Bruce.James Lee held a beer [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt8] and explained why he wasn’tbreaking bricks.In the festive, teetering-toward-rowdy atmosphere of Wally’s luau, James fieldeda stream of lighthearted inquiries about why he hadn’t taken the stage yet tocrush things with his bare hands. A favorite among [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt9]the luau crowd for his past Iron Palm demonstrations, James politely shruggedoff their questions and explained that he was sitting this one out to make roomfor a younger martial artist.The gathering in Colombo Hall [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt10] was in full swing,with the venue decorated top to bottom with island decor and exotic flowers amidthe morphine waltz of island music blaring from the speakers. The luau was ahuge draw for the Bay Area’s Hawaiian community, as well as the smaller thoughequally proud contingent of martial artists within Wally Jay’s orbit.James held the heavy hitters in this latter group in high regard. Not only werethey formidable fighters in their own right, but they understood where martialarts were heading in America.He spoke for some [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt11] time with Ralph Castro and EdParker, the kenpo masters with their own Hawaiian roots. Castro talked about hisplans for expanding his small but dedicated school on Valencia Street in SanFrancisco’s Mission District. He joked that if he took over the lease for thevacant business next door, it might be cheaper to just let his students kickdown the wall that separated the two locations (which they eventually did).Parker operated an ever-expanding network of schools, with his main locationdown in Pasadena. He often traveled up to the Bay Area to confer with hiscolleagues and document martial art performances in Chinatown with his Super 8camera. At the luau he answered the customary questions about how ElvisPresley’s training was going—“The kid is tough [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt12]”—butwas far more excited to talk about his upcoming international martial artsconference later that summer. Parker explained [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt13] thathe had secured a venue in Long Beach. Part showcase, part competition, he saidthat he was hoping to draw heavy attendance from martial artists around theworld.Leo Fong arrived [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt14] shortly after in the greenFairlane, and James Lee invited him to sit with everyone at his table. As aonce-a-week student, Fong didn’t know many of James’s other guys too well. Hedid recognized Al Novak though. A 260-pound [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt15] WorldWar II veteran who had raided Normandy on D-Day, Novak was a muscled beast of afighter. Even the old Chinatown guys—highly dismissive of the idea of Caucasianmartial artists—had to concede Novak’s prowess. James had first met Al at aprevious luau a few years back. The two quickly struck up a friendship and hadbeen training together ever since. Fully aware that martial arts could have vastappeal for a wide audience in America, James eventually ran an action photo ofNovak, a non-Asian, on the cover of a later edition of his first book.As the island revelry [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt16] continued in Colombo Hall,James lit a cigarette and was approached by another guest inquiring why hewasn’t up on stage. James laughed the question off. Just wait and watch the kidabout to perform, he explained with a boozy smile. It would certainly besomething to see.Bruce Lee ignored [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt17] the stairs and just leapt ontocenter stage. Without pause he began to perform a martial arts form, a rehearsedmovement representing specific techniques of a particular fighting style. Atfive feet seven and barely 140 pounds, the young out-of-towner was hardly animposing figure up on stage. Yet the fluidity of his form, along with the zipand pop of his movements, implied something worthwhile, even potentiallyformidable. The crowd watched politely, thinking that the young martial artistshowed promise in his earnestness.Leo Fong, on the [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt18] other hand, watched in completebewilderment. James was suspect of any martial artist that put too much emphasison forms, and Fong couldn’t believe he’d hype up a guy that was only adept inrehearsed movements. Fighting, as they both agreed, was wildly unpredictable,with little room for dance-like choreography. The constant practice of forms wasa key part of where modern martial arts was going astray, they reasoned,producing “locker room” black belts with no sense for (or experience in) a realstreet fight.But then, as if he could hear Fong’s thoughts, Bruce stopped his movements,turned to the crowd, and in a tone that was at once cocksure and condescending,challenged the audience with a simple and defiant question: “How could you[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt19] expect to fight like that?”By the time [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt20] he had agreed to perform at Wally Jay’sluau, Bruce Lee had been giving martial arts demonstrations in America for closeto five years. But by 1964 [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt21] they had taken a far morepointed tone. Whereas he had once demonstrated to merely bring awareness to theobscure Chinese art of kung fu, Bruce now had the specific agenda of advocatingfor a modern and more effective approach to the martial arts, and he pushedtoward this with little regard for the damaged egos that would be left in hiswake.As a result [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt22] Bruce’s reputation was highly polarized.His friends and colleagues found him to be inspiring and infectious, anendlessly energetic individual who kept them thinking and laughing. Theymarveled at his dynamic martial arts ability and gravitated to the logic andpracticality of his viewpoint. For many others, though, he came across as brashand egotistical, an overbearing show-off and a tiresome self-promoter. Acrossthe Bay in San Francisco’s Chinatown, the martial arts community regarded him asa trash-talking troublemaker, with one neighborhood kung fu master dismissinghim as little more than “a dissident with [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt23] badmanners.”When it came to the martial arts in America during the early 1960s, the SanFrancisco Bay Area was the place to be, having benefited from the talent andinfluence of a diverse array of practitioners who had migrated from southernChina, Hong Kong, Japan, and Hawaii. As Al Tracy, a local kenpo teacher andcolleague of Ed Parker at the time, would characterize it: “The real significant[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt24] early development of the martial arts in the UnitedStates was heavily based in the Bay Area. Many of the most important people cameout of the Bay Area, not just for the Chinese but for so much of the martialarts.”By the spring of 1964 [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt25], Bruce had been making regulartrips from Seattle to Oakland for the better part of two years, to collaboratewith James Lee and his colleagues. There in the east bay, Bruce had found themto be a talented group of older and well-seasoned practitioners who wereinclined toward innovation. They embraced him as an equal and indulged hisaround-the-clock fanaticism for the fighting arts. In just a couple months’time, Bruce would fully relocate to Oakland, to further immerse himself in thisunique martial arts laboratory.On the Chinese calendar 1964 was the Year of the Green Dragon. It would be ahard and eventful year for the twenty-three-year-old Bruce Lee. He would dropout [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt26] of college and stare at his career withuncertainty. He would marry [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt27] against the protests ofhis bride’s family and quickly learn that his first child was on the way. Hewould travel [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt28] to Ed Parker’s showcase in Long Beachand defiantly broadcast his dissenting viewpoint to an international audience ofmartial arts practitioners. And before the year’s [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt29]conclusion, he would face Chinatown’s kung fu ace in a behind-closed-doorshigh-noon showdown.Standing on that stage [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt30] in Oakland, Bruce Lee couldhave likely never imagined that he was also less than a year away from his firstforay into American show business, in which he would travel to Hollywood andaudition with Twentieth Century Fox for a role in Charlie Chan’s Number One Son(and be cast, instead, as Kato on The Green Hornet). Furthermore, his bigchallenge [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt31] match in the months ahead would providethe spark for his greatest evolution as a fighter and cause him to begintangibly constructing the new martial arts paradigm that he was alreadybeginning to envision. In this regard 1964 was a pivotal moment for him. TheYear of the Green Dragon would shape his life in profound and long-lasting ways.Bruce Lee’s demonstration [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt32] at Wally Jay’s luauquickly revealed itself to be actually more of a stern lecture. And Leo Fong wasnow puzzled for a whole new set of reasons.“There is no way [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt33] a person is going to fight you inthe street with a set pattern,” Bruce declared from the stage, referring to thechoreography of his initial form. Stepping back toward center stage, he thenworked his way through a Northern Shaolin fighting form. Bruce was impressive inthis rendering as well, launching wide kicks that arced up over his head. Againthough, he was quick with his critique. “Classical methods[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt34] like these are a form of paralysis,” he declared.“Too many practitioners are just blindly rehearsing these systematic routinesand stunts.”A disjointed atmosphere [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt35] spread through the crowd.Much like Fong, the spectators were caught off guard. Martial artsdemonstrations were typically lively affairs with a lot of dynamic ability andmaybe a bit of light humor. Instead, the martial artists within the luau crowdwere being subjected to a young practitioner dressing them down. He waschallenging the worth of what many of the established masters were teaching, anddoing so by emulating their styles and then refuting them. Fong wasn’t surprisedwhen his quick scan of the crowd around him revealed a fair share of red facesand tense expressions. Martial artists, like so many of the Asian cultures theysprang from, were not receptive to boasts or put-downs, particularly fromyounger quarters, and Bruce was dealing heavily in each regard.After concluding his performance—and dismissal—of other fighting styles, Brucebegan to explain the dynamics of the style he taught at his school in Seattle.Here, he explained, the emphasis was on streamlining everything to a tangibleeffectiveness: economy of movement and direct attacks. The focus was on speedand power. No acrobatics, no fancy forms, no excess: the most results for theleast effort.With his peculiar English accent, he began to increasingly punctuate hisdescriptions with quick bursts of punches and advances. “The techniques aresmooth [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt36], short, and extremely fast,” he said beforeletting loose a flurry of fast blasts. “They are direct, to the point and arestripped down to their essential purpose without any wasted motions.”Bruce explained that he liked to think of his approach as “scientific streetfighting [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt37].” His acquaintances in the crowd—Castro,Parker, Novak—knew that he was selling his own brand of the Wing Chun style ofkung fu.Finally, he gave [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt38] a demonstration.Calling up a sizable male volunteer from the front of the stage—“a big football[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt39] linebacker-type,” by Fong’s perspective—Brucechallenged him to block his punch. He explained to the crowd how he would closethe gap between them from a wide distance and successfully strike his opponentwith a tag to the forehead. The entire move was explained; the volunteer and thecrowd knew Bruce’s objective. He asked if the volunteer was ready, and then in atidy blur he was across the stage to tap his opponent an instant ahead of hisblock.The crowd murmured. Bruce’s speed was stunning.“Now, let’s do it [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt40] again.”They reset.“Ready?”Again Bruce moved with blinding speed, like a fencer going for the final point.His opponent tried to compensate with an early move, and Bruce reassessed inmicroseconds, waiting for his block to pass before he tagged him again. Samespot.Bruce left the stage to mixed applause.Fong took stock [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt41]. Despite Lee’s blazing displays ofspeed, much of the crowd was unimpressed. Bruce’s attitude was contrary to theetiquette of both martial artists and Chinese custom, an immediate deal-breakerfor many in attendance. James Lee, on the other hand, didn’t appear fazed in theleast and spent his time after the demonstration gleefully inviting his innercircle over to his house on Monday, for a meeting with Bruce.Fong wasn’t sure what to think. He got in the ring enough to know when someonehad fighting ability, and this kid had speed and coordination like few guys hehad ever seen. Fong also knew where he was coming from philosophically. Brucewas tackling the elephant in the room, putting it front and center for everyoneto consider: Do these skills and techniques really work? Or are they just abunch of fancy routines artfully packaged in Eastern exoticism? For Fong it wasblunt articulation of the same issues and criticisms that he had discussed withJames on numerous occasions.Still, Fong felt uneasy. The kid’s attitude. His attitude was gonna lead totrouble."},{"pageContent":"PART 1 [unp-russo-0007.xhtml#toc]SAN FRANCISCO"},{"pageContent":"1 [unp-russo-0007.xhtml#toc]THE PATRIARCHSan Francisco | March 1959Lau Bun quietly [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt42] lit a cigarette along the top end ofPortsmouth Square, while his senior students conducted class in his nearbybasement studio. He nodded a silent hello to his neighbors as they passed by himalong Brenham Place, and although his emphysema was growing worse, he took histime finishing his smoke.At sixty-eight Lau Bun [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt43] exuded a formidable presencethat belied his years. Slim, with a strong, wiry physique, he possessed piercingeyes under thick-rimmed glasses and hardened features below short gray hair. Hecarried himself with reticence, his only volume amplified through the intensityof his expression.Below him the spacious city park along the lower slope of San Francisco’sChinatown sustained its daily bustle well into the late spring afternoon of1959. Children darted about in dervish-like blurs, as seniors lingered onweathered benches bantering in boisterous Cantonese tones. An anxiousdeliveryman took a swift shortcut through the park, sidestepping clusters ofcasual gamblers who populated the plaza hunched over Old World games embossedwith Chinese characters. Tourists gawked at the neighborhood racket, fascinatedthat the scene was at once so alien and so familiar.The park’s moniker—“the Heart of Chinatown [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt44]”—was apt,yet for reasons far less quaint than the nickname might imply. For all theneighborhood’s success as an exotic tourist destination of unique sights andvibrant flavors, Chinatown was, in many ways, a densely packed ghetto. Most ofits people resided in impossibly cramped quarters, almost barrack-style, withextended families often existing in what were little more than studioapartments, from floor to floor, building to building. In this sense Portsmouthwas really the front porch and sprawling yard of an entire community, providingfresh air and a much-needed reprieve from claustrophobic living spaces teemingwith hyper siblings, down-on-their-luck uncles, and screaming babies.Through the many [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt45] roles he played in the community,Lau Bun was well acquainted with these closely contained quarters. A skilledherbalist and bonesetter, he made house calls to treat injuries and woundsthroughout Chinatown, arriving with his well-worn volume of remedies under onearm and a satchel full of herbs under the other. On occasion he made similartrips, but in a much different capacity, as a “mediator” of disputes for thecommunity orbiting the Hop Sing Tong. The wisdom of his[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt46] years and the physical feats of his youth proved tobe a fitting combination for such a role, and with only a single Chinese officerwithin the ranks of the SFPD, a well-respected figure like Lau Bun was (afterall was said and done) a welcomed alternative to city law enforcement.In a wider sense [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt47] Chinatown had long been its owntightly bound universe within the greater city, hemmed in between the financialdistrict to the south, the dockworkers along the bay to the east, the Italianneighborhood to the north, and the financial elite westward up towering NobHill. For the Chinese the compass had long pointed toward hostility and racismin most directions, making the boundaries of their neighborhood sanctuary welldefined and abrupt, specific even to certain sides of the street. In years pastChinese children who strayed beyond the top end of Broadway Avenue were oftenmet by flying rocks from the kids of North Beach. But those tensions hadsoftened over the past two decades, ever since Pearl Harbor instantly shiftedthe racial scarlet letter on the West Coast from the Chinese to the Japanese.If a curious social [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt48] observation was to be made thereat Brenham Place, it was the fact that Lau Bun and his Chinatown neighbors couldclaim Portsmouth Square for themselves. Not only was the plaza a prime locationin downtown San Francisco, but as its ever-oxidizing memorial plaque testified,the park was flush with U.S. history. Portsmouth was where California was firstdeclared American, courtesy of Captain John Montgomery, who raised stars andstripes over the Mexican customs house that sat on the plaza in 1846. As thecity’s first civic center, it was also where Samuel Brannen, a local businessmanwith a newfound monopoly on mining equipment, first announced the Californiagold rush to everyone within earshot just two years later.The fact then that this park, practically the Plymouth Rock of the west,belonged to a minority of people that the nation scarcely begrudged citizenshipwas certainly no small irony. Though that’s not to say it wasn’t fitting.Chinese immigrants were arriving in San Francisco in the earliest days of thegold rush and had continued to weave integral contributions into the fabric ofthe city (and the American West) through the formative periods to come. Thesewere contributions that, in the face of a century of exclusion and racism, oftenmanifested in ways both silent and unsung.Finishing his smoke, Lau Bun walked the few steps across the narrow street tohis apartment building and quietly descended the steps to assess the end of theevening’s class.Postures became precise, expressions more businesslike, as Lau Bun’s studentsadjusted to his presence before he reached the bottom of the staircase.With more than twenty-five [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt49] years of teaching Choy LiFut kung fu and lion dancing within Chinatown, it was as a teacher—and really,as the neighborhood patriarch—of martial arts that Lau Bun was best known. Andif his reputation in the community was notable, it was legendary among hisstudents. They murmured stories [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt50] of his abilities ontheir short walks home from class: of his enforcer days in the Tong or hisflawless handling of the straight sword. Perhaps it was the tale of the rat thathe killed with a dart . . . at a sizable distance . . . in the dark. Or the mostfrequently told of them all: the “incident” in Los Angeles.Not that Lau Bun’s [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt51] school was swarming withstudents. The size of his classes tended to fluctuate from year to year butalways maintained about a core dozen dedicated students, even as others fell bythe wayside as a result of either too many movies or Lau Bun’s hard-lineinsistence on foundational abilities. Younger students especially interested inhis weapon proficiency—of the straight sword, throwing dart, chain whip, andbutterfly knife—quickly learned that months of horse-stance training came first.Lau Bun’s studio, like much of Chinatown’s spaces, was Spartan. He had a smallburner for cooking beneath the stairs and a tiny adjacent room that was justlarge enough to accommodate a dresser and a bed with little else, opposite acloset-like bathroom. His main room, the studio space for his classes, was notlarge either, barely twelve square feet, but he fit them in well enough. In allthe location cost him forty-five dollars monthly, with a couple of extra dollarsthrown in for utilities. He didn’t have a phone. Prospective students caughtword of him on the streets and descended the steps to inquire. He charged themfifteen dollars a month, and many of them arrived with bags of change, lunchmoney saved over time and more sorely needed for means of defense. Youngarrivals to Chinatown [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt52] quickly learned that hostilitycould come as much from within the neighborhood as without. Native-bornChinatown kids would discriminate heavily against the newcomers, and in adecade’s time this would manifest into serious gang violence. For 1959 it wasstill a matter of fifteen dollars in quarters and dimes, paid to an old masterin exchange for lessons on how to beat someone back on the walk home fromschool. For Lau Bun it was a respectable living and a satisfying way to settleinto old age.In that underground space [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt53], Lau Bun was a hardheadeddrill sergeant, running endless horse-stance exercises, and visibly impatient ifhe had to explain anything more than twice. But he wasn’t without empathy forhis students. He had his own trials on arriving in the United States, anddifficult ones at that. This softer side [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt54] was moreapparent to his older students, not just for their tenure in Lau Bun’s presence,but for the acquired wisdom that within kung fu exists a duality of hard andsoft, a yin yang that applies not just to fighting technique but to theindividual martial artists themselves. Lau Bun’s softer side was apparent in hisbedside manner surrounding his medicine and the serene tones he persuaded out ofhis well-worn butterfly banjo during the school’s quieter moments.Standing beside them [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt55] now, he sized up his class.They held their horse stances firm, legs strong but split. It was their base,their foundation for fighting. Everything stemmed from your jot ma—your horsestance—every advance, every punch. He insisted that they hold that pose forgreat lengths of time, until it was solid, until it was formidable. It was apractice that wore down many newcomers, imposed on them for months and inspiringinternal questions of whether they should have used their lunch money at theschool cafeteria instead. Others just couldn’t endure the monotony of thetraining, having joined expecting a fast track toward the mastery of thestraight sword, or (in high-hope whispers at least) the Ten Thousand Elephantsform.Lau Bun continued [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt56] to inspect his students as theyheld strong in their school clothes. Not bad. Then he settled on a newer studentspread too wide. Lau Bun stood closer, looked him over again, and pushed throughhim till he tumbled to the tiled floor.A weak foundation wasn’t much of anything at all.The history of Chinatown is uniquely intertwined with the origins of SanFrancisco itself, and to understand one is to grasp much of the other as well.In fact, just one block to the west of Portsmouth Square, along the busiestthoroughfare in the neighborhood, is where San Francisco took its first formalsteps to becoming a city, and in turn, where the history of Chinatown begins.At the time of its settlement by eighteenth century European explorers, the SanFrancisco Peninsula was an idyllic seven-square-mile protrusion of coastallandscape dominated by sprawling sand dunes, massive hills, and epic bouts ofsweeping fog. It is positioned between a sizable bay to the east and the coldwaters of the Pacific Ocean to the west. The area’s native people[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt57], the Ohlone, spanned the Northern California coastfor hundreds of miles, with settlements from Big Sur to Mendocino, and thrivedfor millennia in the region’s mild climate and abundant natural resources.The Spanish arrived [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt58] first, seeking to both convertthe natives to Christianity and guard against Russian and British territorialinterests in the area. They developed outposts on the peninsula in 1776 as partof their system of missions that stretched north from Mexico through California,constructing the Presidio as a military installation on the north end of thepeninsula, and then the Mission Dolores along a creek about two miles to thesoutheast. The settlements were as scenic and pristine as they were isolated andremote, existing with little variation for half a century.Shortly after Mexico declared [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt59] its independence fromSpain in 1821, William Richardson, the chief mate of a British whaling vessel,stayed behind to marry into a local family. With an eye on the region’s realestate, he applied for Mexican citizenship and built the first home outside thePresidio and mission in 1832, in the northeast section of the peninsula alongwhat would soon be called Calle de la Fondacion (later known as Dupont Street,and eventually Grant Avenue, Chinatown’s main thoroughfare). One year laterJacob Leese, a merchant from Ohio, built a house just south of Richardson, whosaw the advent of a neighbor as reason enough to begin designing a formal streetplan for what would be a new, though still sparsely populated, community. Evenas Montgomery [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt60] claimed California for the UnitedStates within sight of Richardson’s home some twelve years later, San Franciscowas a sleepy backwater port in the Pacific wilderness barely numbering threehundred inhabitants.Events in the spring [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt61] of 1848 changed the far-flungfrontier town forever. The United States finalized its annexation of Californiafrom Mexico just days after gold was discovered in the distant hinterlands tothe northeast of San Francisco. Within just a few years of Brannen marching intoPortsmouth with profits in his eyes and announcements of gold on his lips, thelocal population would expand to some thirty-six thousand inhabitants, fortunehunters from seemingly every corner of the globe who transformed San Franciscointo a booming rough-and-tumble Pacific port. For the Chinese the promise of SanFrancisco was more than just opportunity—it was fable, spoken of in hopefultones as Gam Saan, the “Gold Mountain.”By the mid-nineteenth [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt62] century many Chinese werealready inclined to test their fortunes abroad. Oppressive taxes imposed in theturbulent fallout of the Qing Empire’s loss in the first Opium War resulted in asystematic bankrupting of China’s peasant farmers.From Havana to Johannesburg [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt63] Chinese communitiesbegan to spring up in cities around the world during the mid-nineteenth century,as the country’s impoverished citizenry looked abroad for opportunity to escapethe dire social conditions at home under the Manchu government.Of the many Chinese who emigrated during this period (some two and a halfmillion from 1840 to 1900), the lion’s share of those traveling eastward acrossthe Pacific to Hawaii and the United States hailed from Guangdong Province, insouthern China. The region, through its [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt64] city ofCanton, already had a long tradition of commercial trade and worker exchangewith foreign nations, and by 1850 was suffering [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt65] atrifecta of catastrophe in the form of widespread rebellion, institutionalcorruption, and disastrous flooding, pushing many to the brink of starvation.With stories trickling back [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt66] across the Pacifictelling of a pristine foreign land abundant with riches, several hundred Chinesegambled on the “golden romance [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt67]” in 1849 and 1850during the prime early years of the rush. When some of these initial adventurerssoon returned home bearing startling newfound wealth—evidence that the fable wasfact—the migrations began in earnest. By 1852 over twenty thousand[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt68] Chinese had traveled to the United States throughSan Francisco, composing almost 10 percent of California’s population at thetime and nearly a quarter of its labor force.The Chinese who arrived [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt69] in San Francisco were quickto set out for gold country, stopping only briefly in their own ethnic enclavealong Sacramento Street, a few blocks south of Portsmouth Square. As fortuneswere made and new districts developed, William Richardson’s old neighborhoodalong Dupont was increasingly abandoned for better quarters (particularly aftermassive fires [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt70] leveled the fledgling city six timesin just eighteen months between 1850 and 1851), allowing the nearby Chinesesettlement to expand northward block by block, into the area that it occupiesstill today.In light of the widespread [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt71] racism that followed,it’s easily lost in the long-term historical narrative that Chinese immigrantswere at first well received in America during the nineteenth century. At thefederal level [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt72], U.S. policy maker Aaron H. Palmersubmitted a plan to Congress during this period advocating for increased Chineseimmigration to America, deeming them a boon to the domestic labor force. In 1852Governor John [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt73] McDougal echoed this line of thoughtby urging that the Chinese immigrants to California be given land grants. In SanFrancisco the Chinese were regarded with tolerance and a quaint affection,perceived as an exotic and hardworking portion of the growing local communitythat was destined for assimilation by Christian missionaries. Chinese migrantsdressed in their traditional silk robes to participate in civic events andholiday celebrations in Portsmouth Square, such as in 1850 when U.S. justiceNathaniel Bennett asserted to them: “Born and reared under[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt74] different governments and speaking differenttongues, we nevertheless meet here today as brothers. . . . You stand among usin all respects as equals. . . . Henceforth we have one country, one hope, onedestiny.” The Alta California newspaper echoed his sentiments when iteditorialized that the Chinese immigrants would “yet vote at the same polls[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt75] . . . as our own countrymen.” Mark Twain laterwrote, “A disorderly Chinaman [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt76] is rare, and a lazyone does not exist. They are quiet, peaceable, tractable, free fromdrunkenness.”This honeymoon proved [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt77] short-lived, particularly asthere was less gold to be found yet more and more Chinese arriving to pursue it.The tone soon grew hostile first in the mining camps of gold country and thenamid the labor struggles of San Francisco, where the Chinese showed littleinterest in assimilation and “Little China” grew into a much-larger “Chinatown.”Calls for the restriction of Chinese rights and citizenship in Americaflourished in the coming years, effectively scapegoating the Chinese as thesource of myriad labor woes in the West, particularly as a severe depression setin during the 1870s. In San Francisco racist newspaper editorials and cartoons,along with demagogue labor organizers and vigilante mobs, echoed city hall’santi-Chinese attitude in the decades following the gold rush. One San Franciscancharacterized the situation by saying, “In 1852 the Chinamen[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt78] were allowed to turn out and celebrate the Fourth ofJuly and it was considered a happy time. In 1862 they would have been mobbed. In1872 they would have been burned at the stake.”By 1882 Congress had passed [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt79] the Chinese ExclusionAct, effectively putting a decade-long moratorium on the immigration of Chineselaborers and prohibiting citizenship for foreign-born Chinese in America. It wasa complete turnaround from the positive view taken by Palmer at the federallevel a few decades earlier and proved a perfect diversion from the much morecomplex issues of labor and unemployment in a burgeoning nation awash inresources. The key labor role the Chinese had played in building the West—in thecities, in the farm fields, and on the railroad lines—were brushed aside assupport for the act proved high. It was extended in 1892 for ten more years,before being extended again and then made “permanent” in 1904.Just a few years later [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt80], the leaders of San Franciscosaw the catastrophic 1906 earthquake, which culminated in the eastern portion ofthe city burning to the ground, as an opportune moment to relocate the Chineseand Chinatown to a remote corner of the city.By the beginning of the twentieth century, it was officially governmentpolicy—nationally and locally—that the Chinese presence would be curbed inAmerica.Among the ranks [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt81] of Chinese adventurers who foundfinancial prosperity in their sojourn in America was Lau Bun’s father, who atthe turn of the century began sending the results of his labor back across thePacific to his family in Toi San, a city along the southern coast of GuangdongProvince in the Pearl River Valley. The wealth offered the young Lau Bunopportunities in education, as well as the chance to study martial arts withlocal masters. He dabbled for a time in a variety of styles, until he witnesseda friend’s dominant display of Choy Li Fut kung fu—a whirling cyclone ofwhipping fists and furious punches—which made the young Lau Bun intent onmastering it.Developed in the early nineteenth century by Master Chan Heung, Choy Li Futcombines elements and techniques of three different southern styles of kung futo form a unique combat approach: angular stances and extended posturesunleashing a barrage of roundhouse punches and elongated uppercuts in a varietyof directions, earning the style a reputation for keen effectiveness in fightingagainst multiple opponents. By 1850 Choy Li Fut had drawn a big following amongthe peasant class, with students of Heung branching out around southern Chinaand forming a network of schools that garnered heavy enrollment. In time thesebranches began taking on their own distinctive personalities and uniqueinterpretations of the style.Lau Bun sought out Yeun Hai, the master of the Toi San school of Choy Li Fut.Retired and settling into his twilight years, Yeun Hai had hailed from the HungSing branch of Choy Li Fut in Fut San, a school known for its combat orientationand aggressive fighting technique. In the tradition of the school branchingoutward, Yuen Hai traveled from the Fut San school to open a new location in ToiSan, where he taught for many years and took a young female martial artspractitioner to be his wife.Persistent and bearing enough resources to be convincing, Lau Bun brokered adeal to take in the aging couple and provide for their room and board in theyears to come in exchange for their tutelage. The proximity allowed Lau Bunprivate and intensive study of the couple’s martial arts knowledge and endearedhim to them as a son. Under Yeun Hai he learned not only Choy Li Fut but alsoChinese herbalism and bonesetting. Before he passed Yeun Hai conveyed to Lau Bunthe formidable Ten Thousand Elephants technique, a highly guarded close combatmaneuver meant to be employed to devastating effect (and named as such to conveythat each finger will strike with the weight of a thousand elephants).As a young adult Lau Bun eventually departed to seek economic fortune in theUnited States, just as his father had done before him. With immigrationsuspended for Chinese nationals, Lau Bun took an alternative route throughMexico (a popular option in light of the now rigid exclusion law) and enteredAmerica through San Diego, before traveling to find kin in Los Angeles. He setup a legal [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt82] identity as a “paper son” under the nameWong On, exploiting—like many other Chinese migrants of the era—an immigrationloophole that arose after the destruction of so many legal records in the 1906San Francisco earthquake and fire. He resided in the Chinese community of LosAngeles for a few years in the late 1920s, when trouble came knocking.In an incident [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt83] that would forever be attached to hisreputation and would shroud his martial arts prowess in legend for years tocome, Lau Bun fought his way out of a raid by federal immigration agents, withnothing more than his kung fu. While versions of the story vary among thetellers (some go as far as saying that Lau Bun took the lives of two agents inthe skirmish), it is typically told that he was cornered in an apartmentbuilding by a group of four immigration agents. Trapped and outnumbered, LauBun—now adept at becoming his own whirling cyclone of whipping fists and furiousassaults—fought his way through them before leaping from a second-story windowand disappearing into the streets of Los Angeles.The event made [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt84] a minor folk hero of Lau Bun in aChinese community that was constantly under threats and harassment fromimmigration officials. It also caught [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt85] the attentionof the Hop Sing Tong, which, in a recruiting effort, proposed to him a mutuallybeneficial arrangement: Lau Bun would be safely relocated out of Los Angeles tothe Tong’s San Francisco branch, and in return he would teach kung fu to itsmembers and their children. Furthermore, with a resurgence of tong rivalries inChinatown, his talents would be put to good use as a bodyguard and an enforcer.As Chinatown grew in San Francisco, the neighborhood structured itself aroundvarious types of community groups and neighborhood organizations. Among theirmany roles these groups provided assistance in the acclimation of new arrivalsfrom China, protection against anti-Chinese hostility, and aid in theirbrethren’s eventual return to their homeland (even if it was in a casket).Others groups were purely social. The organizations often took shape accordingto regional origins and familial affiliations from China and, in many ways, werethe governing bodies of Chinatown itself.The tongs were modeled [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt86] after the secret societiesand underground rebellious groups that quietly formed in Guangdong during thenineteenth century to foment the overthrow of Manchu rule and advocate for thereturn of a Chinese-led dynasty. By the 1880s the tongs in San Francisco hadveered sharply toward organized crime (causing the up-and-up communityassociations to add the prefix “Benevolent” to their own title as adistinction), and it was as part of this dynamic that Chinese martial artistswere first woven into the social fabric of life in the New World during thenineteenth century. In what was hardly an athletic or social endeavor, earlyChinese martial artists in America trained tong soldiers for combat surroundingthe governance of vice. It is partly within this context that the martial artsgarnered a peculiar status in the community. Unlike the respect and prestigethat the martial arts held in Japanese culture as national sport and tradition,in the Chinese community these fighting skills were suspiciously regarded as thecovenant of eccentrics, troublemakers, and gangsters.In its early years [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt87] San Francisco’s Chinatown was ahighly law-abiding neighborhood (particularly in contrast to the utter depravityof the red light district to its immediate east, the Barbary Coast). Yet asanti-Chinese [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt88] hostility peaked in the 1870s and callsfor exclusion manifested into federal policy, the lawful leaders of Chinatownlost traction to a rising tide of crime-oriented tong organizations thriving offgambling, opium, and prostitution. The law-abiding residents of Chinatown weresoon caught in the crossfire as the tongs competed against one another for thesemarkets, sowing rampant violence throughout Chinatown at the end of the century.The proliferation of murder and vice within the tong wars only inflamed callsfor a permanent exclusion act, even as the current policy only furtherdisenfranchised the established leadership in Chinatown. It was a vicious cyclethat spilled into the early years of the twentieth century, until the situationwas abruptly curbed through extraordinary circumstances.On the morning of April 18 [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt89], 1906, the city of SanFrancisco experienced a massive 8.3 magnitude earthquake that purportedly lastedforty-eight seconds. The earthquake damaged the city’s underground water mainsand left firemen ill-prepared to battle the raging blaze that developed from itsdestruction. In the following days an epic inferno consumed the entire easternside of the city. Chinatown was reduced to ashes. The brothels and opium denswent with it.City leaders perceived [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt90] a unique opportunity torelocate the Chinese to a more remote southeast corner of the city (and evenorganized an official subcommittee for doing so). The leaders of Chinatown[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt91], on the other hand, wasted little time in quicklyrebuilding in the same location and effectively outmaneuvering efforts ofremoval. The plan was simple and had already been in the works in the yearsprior: Chinatown needed to have a contributing effect to the city, and thiswould be best accomplished by way of transforming it into a tourist mecca and aneconomic boon to city coffers. The new Chinatown was then strategically rebuiltin a style that would evoke the Orient, with a pioneering style of architecturethat was unprecedented anywhere else in the world, combining Western structureswith Asian accents: sturdy brick apartment buildings with pagoda roofs, curvedbalconies, and gilded exteriors. The San Francisco Real Estate Board applaudedthe early results and began encouraging that all new structures in theneighborhood follow a similar approach. Plans for relocation fell by thewayside.The level of blatant vice that existed in San Francisco was no longer openlytolerated by the city, neither in Chinatown nor in the Barbary Coast. In theyears immediately following the earthquake, the city effectively stamped out thelast vestiges of the Barbary for good, while the tongs in Chinatown turnedtoward political organizing and less visible forms of criminal activity. Opiumnever flourished again, but gambling and extortion remained just under thesurface. Tong muscle never needed to take the shape of such formal soldieringagain, but neither was it obsolete. Lau Bun taught Choy Li Fut for many years tomembers of the Hop Sing Tong, while also working as an enforcer for theorganization.In the Depression-era economic climate leading up to World War II, employmentoptions for Chinese Americans were particularly narrow, and, as one sociologistpointed out [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt92], could essentially be grouped into justfour categories: chop suey restaurants, gift shops, native grocery stores, andChinese laundries. Lau Bun unknowingly entered into a new category when he founda small space on Clay Street to operate as a more formal practice studio. Hecalled it the Wah-Keung (meaning the “strong Chinese”) Kung Fu Club of Choy LiFut and opened to interested neighborhood residents. It was a quiet transitionof martial arts from the tongs to the public, though it really represented a seachange in how the Chinese martial arts would be both practiced and perceived intwentieth-century America. And unlike the gift shops and chop sueyrestaurants—which played to Western notions of Chinese culture—Lau Bun wasdealing in the real thing.However, in a mind-set [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt93] that descended from thetongs’ secretive inclinations toward authority as well as their protectivenature of the community in a foreign land, martial arts instruction was not onlystrictly limited to Chinese people; it was also not meant to be flaunted aboutin public but rather displayed quietly and with reservation, as if one werehandling a concealed weapon. This was a deeply entrenched tong code developedover many generations, from the secret societies of Guangdong to the advent ofanti-Chinese mobs in San Francisco during the 1870s, and Lau Bun was a staunchproponent of this insular philosophy.Even still, he was also known to allow occasional exception.The din of the nearby street noise softened with the evening hour as Lau Bunpoured himself some tea and sat quietly in his basement studio. He left the doorat the top of the stairs open a while longer, listening for signs of hisstudents’ return.Lau Bun had settled nicely into his humble lifestyle there on Brennan Alley. Hemade an adequate income and had a spacious outdoor park at his doorstep. Betteryet, his school had now lasted a full two decades, with new students regularlywandering down his stairs. With his change of location from Clay Street yearsearlier, he’d replaced the name Wah-Keung with Hung Sing, to align his schoolwith its origins of his teacher Yuen Hai and their particular branch of Choy LiFut. He had experienced some hard times and tense moments since his youth in ToiSan, memories that were a stark contrast to the tranquility of his subterraneanquarters at that moment, there in the oldest part of his strange New World city.Footsteps echoed down from the stairwell, breaking his introspection, as a groupof his senior students descended into the studio at an anxious pace. Theyquickly removed their shoes at the base of the stairs and bowed to acknowledgetheir teacher, their sifu. Lau Bun put down his teacup and rose to stand beforethem. Their adrenaline was still palpable, and their expressions (as well astheir lack of bruises) suggested that they had been successful in theirendeavors this evening.He had sent them southeast [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt94], to test their kung fuskills in a Latino section of the city’s Mission District. It wasn’t a difficultplace for them to pick a fight, and the prospect of police involvement wasminimal. He had dispatched them with few instructions, and they had left withzeal.For all of his relentless insistence on horse-stance drills and rugged practicetime, Lau Bun knew that there was a level of training that couldn’t be acquiredin the studio. He had observed (through close proximity) enough tong incidentsto know that the real testing grounds for a fighter were on the streets, and heintended to keep his students—his dedicated, long-term senior students—in tune.They learned a lot from these skirmishes, and for all of Lau Bun’s stoicism, hetook pride in their victories.“Boys,” he said [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt95] to them in Cantonese, “how did we dotonight?”"},{"pageContent":"2 [unp-russo-0007.xhtml#toc]NATIVE SONSan Francisco | May 17, 1959Bruce Lee stood near the deck railing with a group of fellow passengers as theocean liner finally entered San Francisco Bay. It had been almost three[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt96] weeks since the President Lines ship had departedHong Kong, since Bruce nervously said good-bye to his family and awkwardlyboasted to his friends that he would “become famous in America[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt97].”The voyage across the Pacific [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt98] had been long buthardly arduous. Although he was quartered in third class, Bruce passed the timesocializing with first-class passengers and giving them dance lessons eachevening in the ship’s ample ballroom. Bruce was the life of the party, and manyof his nights aboard the USS President Wilson turned into a blissful sort oflimbo as he sailed toward an uncertain future.With their seafaring revelry now concluded, his fellow travelers took turns[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt99] posing for photographs with Bruce along the railing,producing a quick memento to remember their dynamic teenage dance instructor.They were all dressed sharp for their arrival, and Bruce was no exception,wearing a dark suit, light tie, and sunglasses that complemented his boyish goodlooks.As the passengers prepared to disembark, Bruce felt that same mixture of anxietyand optimism that had nagged him since his departure. While the dance floor hadprovided a frequent reprieve, he had been deeply introspective[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt100] throughout the trip, mindful that he was teeteringbetween chapters of his life.With his childhood abruptly concluded behind the Pacific horizon, he settled hisattention on the American landscape that stretched out before him. San Franciscowas the city of his birth, and now eighteen years later, it would also serve asmidwife to his adulthood. The years that transpired [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt101]in the interim had, in many ways, proven auspicious. Bruce was a successfulchild actor of the Hong Kong cinema, appearing in numerous films and gainingincreasing fame through the recent success of his first starring role, in TheOrphan. Tenacious and ferociously motivated, Bruce was a high school boxingchampion and promising student of venerated Wing Chun kung fu master Ip Man.Charismatic, social, and seemingly hyperactive, he was also Hong Kong’s reigningnational cha-cha dance champion.His present trip to America [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt102], however, was not basedon these youthful achievements but rather as a solution to his ever-increasingappetite for teenage mischief. Bruce had been immersed in the contentiousstreet-fighting culture of Hong Kong, and his most recent scrape caught theattention of the local authorities, who admonished his mother and warned that hewas a step away from being arrested. In turn, she suggested to her husband thatit was an opportune moment for their son to take advantage of his Americancitizenship, an idea that Bruce’s father all-too-readily embraced.And now weeks later, exiled to the opposite side of the Pacific, Bruce washolding a suitcase in the shadow of the Golden Gate Bridge, while his classmatesin Hong Kong prepared for their graduation.San Francisco’s Chinatown was a colorful cacophony of bright neon signs andrichly painted buildings. An intermingling frenzy of tourists and residentsplayed out in a riotous street-level scurry amid local grocery stores, chop sueyrestaurants, gaudy gift shops, and ornate theaters. The neighborhood wassimultaneously a genuine Chinese community and a consciously orchestratedtourist destination, a unique piece of a vibrant city that had manifested inways that even the earthquake-era leaders could have scarcely imagined.Bruce soaked it all in, basking in its newness yet taking comfort in itsfamiliarity. He had been met at the immigration office by his godfather, QuanGing Ho, a close friend and colleague of his father, who greeted him with greataffection before shuttling him off to Chinatown. Mr. Quan, a playwright, poet,and integral member of Chinatown’s opera scene, had agreed to put up his godsonfor the next few months before Bruce moved to Seattle to resume his education inthe fall.His apartment, on the lower [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt103] slope of Chinatown at654 Jackson Street, was as simple as it was cramped, offering Bruce a single bedtightly packed between other pieces of furniture in the corner of the main room.The bathroom and kitchen were located down a narrow hallway and shared with theresidents of the other units. For Bruce, who had grown up fairly affluent inHong Kong, attended to by his family’s servants, the space was as depressing asit was claustrophobic, a clear reminder that his current circumstances werepredicated more on necessity than opportunity.Before his young guest could dwell on the space, Mr. Quan hustled Bruce back outonto the street for a whirlwind tour of the neighborhood. There was much forBruce to see in Chinatown, especially since much of his own personal history wasintertwined with the community. Mr. Quan hurried him up to Grant Avenue, where along banner stretched high over elaborate lamp posts, proclaiming, “The LargestChinatown [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt104] in the World.” After just a moment’s walkfrom Mr. Quan’s apartment, the two were now standing before the ornate entrywayto the Sun Sing Theater. Bruce knew before Mr. Quan [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt105]had even said it that this was the theater where his father had performed.In the autumn of 1939 [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt106], Bruce’s parents, Lee HoiChuen and Grace Hoi An, had traveled to the United States on tour with HongKong’s Cantonese Opera. Hoi Chuen was a well-known and very successful Chinesecomedic actor of both stage and screen. His wife, Grace, a beautiful woman witha quarter European ancestry, accompanied him on the trip as a wardrobe manager.For a Chinese couple in the era of exclusion laws, it was a rare opportunity totravel to America, and not long after their visas were extended, they learned ofGrace’s pregnancy.Mr. Quan explained how the [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt107] Sun Sing was originallyknown as the Mandarin Theater and that his father’s time performing there was agreat success. Having spent many youthful hours on film sets and in theaters,Bruce was well aware of both his father’s stage talents and the adoration hereceived from audience members. Yet his own relationship[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt108] with his father seemed perpetually strained by aterse and distant dynamic that played out throughout his childhood right upuntil the moment he had boarded that steamship for America. In truth Hoi Chuen’srigidness with his son was hardly exceptional but rather typical of Chinesetradition, where a father’s authority must eclipse his affections. And Bruce’steenage years had certainly caused ample opportunity for Hoi Cheun’s affectionto get wholly lost in the shuffle.Mr. Quan continued speaking, explaining how the rich tradition of the Cantonese[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt109] opera not only went back centuries in southernChina but was a fixture of San Francisco’s Chinatown since the days of the goldrush. Bruce examined the entrance to the theater with his father on his mind,knowing full well that his recent troubles had done little to alleviate thetension between them.As they walked back along Grant, Mr. Quan maintained his role as gleeful tourguide, pointing out random bits of neighborhood color in the late-afternoonsidewalk bustle. He gestured to a newspaper clipping taped up in a window of astreet-level storefront and explained how a girl with the name of Lee had wonthis year’s beauty pageant. The article displayed the face[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt110] of Leona Lee, a twenty-year-old beauty from Hawaiiwho was recently crowned Miss Chinatown USA. The decades-old neighborhoodpageant had recently gone national, requiring organizers to relocate the eventfrom the Great China Theater to the much larger Masonic Auditorium up on NobHill. When the judges asked Leona, “Who is the greatest woman in the world?” shereplied with charismatic nonchalance—“My mother, of course”—and locked up thetop prize.Before Bruce could dwell on Leona’s charms, Mr. Quan gestured north towardBroadway and explained how there was an important bookstore at the end of theblock that had just won a major court case about poetry. A published poethimself [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt111] (his most recent volume, titled TwoContinents, dealt with themes of identity among Chinese immigrants), Mr. Quanwas referring to [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt112] Lawrence Ferlinghetti’s bookstore,City Lights, which had made national news in garnering an obscenity charge forpublishing Allen Ginsberg’s Howl. City Lights was ground zero for the Beatcounterculture in San Francisco, and Ginsberg had written his iconic poem justone block to the east, in a tiny apartment on Washington Avenue.Bruce had barely begun to make sense of the bookstore topic, when Mr. Quan againshifted gears, pointing to a building across Grant Avenue and explaining how ithoused The Lion’s Den, one of [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt113] the neighborhood’smany great nightclubs. Since the late thirties San Francisco’s Chinatown hadboasted an array of popular venues that showcased Chinese singers and dancers inelaborate floorshows and costumes. Mr. Quan rattled off many of these places forBruce as they crossed the street. Among the best was the Chinese Skyroom,located on the top corner floor of a building at the far end of Grant, whereshows would often end with the house dance troupe—The Wongettes—leading a congaline around the club, while high-stakes poker games would go late into the nightbeyond the back bar. Yet the most notable of all, was Forbidden City, over onSutter, where the gregarious owner, Charlie Low, put on some of the mostambitious floor shows outside of Vegas. The entryway of Forbidden City was stilllined with dozens of photos showing off the celebrities who had come through—thelikes of Gene Kelly, Duke Ellington, Bob Hope—but as spectators, not performers.They came to see the Chinatown talent, like crooner Larry Ching (billed as “theChinese Frank Sinatra”) and Gee Ming, the house magician. There had been manyother locations too—Club Mandalay by Portsmouth Square, the Kubla Khan on Grant,and Club Shangri-La on Bush Street—that had since fallen by the wayside.Ascending Jackson Street’s vertical landscape, the pair passed by a curbsidenewsstand, sporting the Chinese Times, the Chinese Pacific Weekly, and theChinese World. The neighborhood may have been [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt114] onlysix blocks wide, but it had a long tradition of publishing its ownChinese-language newspapers. One of the city’s two [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt115]big English-language dailies, the San Francisco Chronicle, blared a headlineabout the Giants moving into second place in the baseball standings, giving themequal billing with the main headline of President Eisenhower’s latest nuclearmissile talks with Russia. The Giants had arrived [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt116]from New York just the year before after being wooed by San Francisco’sambitious Republican mayor George Christopher. The city embraced the team—andits dynamic centerfielder Willie Mays—from the get-go, filling the old stadiumat Sixteenth and Bryant while a new one was being constructed at CandlestickPoint. (Ironically, Mays had gone [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt117] 3 for 5 inyesterday’s game yet continued to get booed by hometown fans, on account ofpopping up a ball-four pitch in a key spot earlier that week.) Although the teamhadn’t even settled into a stadium, Bay Area fans already sensed a championshipin their newly acquired ball club (and while the Giants would indeed face theYankees in the 1962 World Series, it would be almost four more decades beforethey actually wore the crown).Jackson Street seemed to ascend infinitely upward. Crossing Stockton Street, Mr.Quan pointed to a large white stone building with curved pagoda-styled roofingat the top, “And this,” he explained [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt118], as he finallycame to a stop on the sidewalk, “is where you were born.”It was a handsome building [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt119], particularly for ahospital. Bruce’s parents had told him the story, but it was fascinating tofinally see it in person. Mr. Quan explained how the hospital—built threedecades earlier on community fund-raising—was a cornerstone of the neighborhoodand for a long time was the only medical facility in the city that would attendto Chinese patients.Inching up the block, Mr. Quan shifted his attention past the hospital. “Yourparents lived here [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt120], on the alley,” he said,pointing toward Trenton Street, which ran through the middle of the block. “Whenyour mother was ready, we just walked her across the street.”Hoi Cheun was performing [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt121] a series of engagements inNew York City’s Chinatown when Grace went into labor during the last week ofNovember 1940. Her son was born early on the morning of the twenty-seventh, inthe Year of the Dragon at the Hour of the Dragon. The name she chose—Lee JunFan—carried specific meaning. As his family would later explain, “The truemeaning of Bruce’s name [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt122]—JUN FAN—was ‘to arouse andmake FAN (the United States) prosperous.’ The gut feeling of many Chinese atthat time, who felt suppressed by and inferior to foreign powers, was that theywished to outshine the more superior countries and regain the Golden Age ofChina. Bruce’s parents wanted Bruce to have his name shine and shake the foreigncountries.” At the Chinese Hospital [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt123] the attendingphysician, Dr. Mary Glover, had suggested that the boy also needed an Americanname, to which one of the nurses proposed “Bruce.” The American name would later[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt124] confound Hoi Cheun, who admitted he just couldn’tpronounce it (more interesting still, Bruce would be entirely unaware[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt125] of his English name until his early teens). Thefamily remained in San Francisco for four more months with their newborn son, asHoi Cheun finished his remaining shows on the West Coast and Grace made certainher son’s citizenship was in order.As they turned back down Jackson Street, Mr. Quan pointed across to theGrandview Theater, which housed another of Bruce’s early beginnings. Beforedeparting the United States [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt126], Hoi Cheun had arrangedhis son’s first foray into show business, with a small role—a prop really—as anewborn baby in the film Golden Gate Girl. It was made by pioneering Chinesefemale director Esther Heng and had proved to be one of her most successfulfilms. In this regard Bruce’s show-business career had really begun before hecould crawl, and it was just one more facet of his history along thesestreets—from the Mandarin Theater to Trenton Alley—which did little to lessenthe introspective mood that had enveloped him during his trip from Hong Kong.Ducking into a nearby restaurant for dinner, it occurred to Mr. Quan that Brucehardly seemed like an unruly adolescent. Rather, he was quiet, polite, andsurprisingly shy. He appeared outwardly proud of being Chinese and seemed toexpress genuine interest in the points of history around the neighborhood. Mostsurprising to Mr. Quan [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt127], however, was that Bruceseemed far less interested in talking about his film career than about hispassion for martial arts. More than just some teenage hobby, Bruce characterizedit as the main interest in life, and he was entirely serious when he told Mr.Quan that he would like to express to the entire world the greatness of theChinese martial arts.After dinner the two stopped to inspect the fourteen-foot statue of Sun Yat-senthat stood tall over the small neighborhood park opposite St. Mary’s Cathedral.The “Father of Modern China” [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt128] (or, as somehistorians characterize him—“China’s George Washington[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt129]”) Sun Yat-sen was instrumental in orchestrating the1912 overthrow of the Qing Dynasty and the toppling of China’s last emperor.While in exile during [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt130] the years leading up to therevolution, Sun Yat-sen had spent time in San Francisco’s Chinatown raisingmoney via the Ghee Kung Tong on Spofford Alley to fund the rebellion at home.Bruce was familiar with [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt131] the historical figure,knowing that his mother’s side of the family—a greatly influential Hong Kongclan—also worked to support Sun Yat-sen’s revolution.For many other residents of [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt132] San Francisco’sChinatown, the statue had a more recent significance. Mr. Quan explained howthis was where Madame Chiang Kai-shek came when she visited Chinatown, and thatthe city received her like royalty.After many decades of [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt133] experiencing hostility andexclusion, the Chinese in America were quickly embraced—literally overnight—ascomrades-in-arms in the face of the Japanese attacks on Pearl Harbor. MadameChiang had traveled [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt134] to the United States on agoodwill tour in March 1943, at the height of the war, to drum up support forChina’s struggle against Japan. To say that she was received like royalty was anunderstatement. Rather, she was treated like a beloved female heroine who hadmagically stepped from one of history’s epic sagas, like some Asian amalgamationof Scarlett O’Hara and Joan of Arc. Educated in America and evoking the Westernideal of exotic Eastern beauty, Madame Chiang captivated audiences around theUnited States during the length of her tour. In Washington her address toCongress was met with a booming ovation and beaming press, while in Los Angeles,she drew a capacity crowd to the Hollywood Bowl for a glitzy affair beset byA-list movie stars. In San Francisco her tour [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt135]stopped traffic across multiple neighborhoods as thousands of spectators packedentire city blocks to get a glimpse of her at the Civic Center and in Chinatown.Although she never spoke about [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt136] the ChineseExclusion Laws while in America, President Roosevelt rescinded them months later(while, for all practical purposes, restriction on Chinese immigration stayed ineffect until 1965 and didn’t fully resume until a few years later).From a more behind-the-scenes [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt137] historical viewpoint,her visit was hardly pristine. By the end of her tour she was drawing increasedcriticism for lavish shopping trips at a time when her countrymen were literallystarving. FBI director J. Edgar Hoover suspected that she was embezzling largeamounts of the money she was raising, and Americans who hosted her weretypically appalled by the overly entitled behavior of her entourage. Yet thisundercurrent was mostly lost in the applause. Madame Chiang’s visit heavilyaltered American attitudes toward Chinese people, as the sum total of herintellect and beauty proved the perfect equation for reshaping viewpoints withinthe current historical circumstances.However, this change in perceptions [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt138] that MadameChiang had affected was hardly all-encompassing, as derogatory caricatures ofAsians would still dominate the American media for years to come: stereotypes oflaundry men and rickshaw drivers or conniving villains in the mold of dragonladies and Fu Manchu. Socially, Asians Americans (like other racial minoritiesin the United States) were still widely treated as second-class citizens,lacking voter protections and housing rights. Bans on interracial marriage andimmigration remained in place. In San Francisco the Chinese[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt139] were still relegated to living in Chinatown andlacked any representation in political office.But Bruce was returning to America as the nation’s social landscape was poisedto shift. Recently, the city of San Francisco [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt140] hadsworn in Herbert Lee as the first Asian officer within the ranks of the policedepartment. Nationally, Hiram Fong would soon [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt141] bethe first American of Chinese descent elected to the U.S. Senate, just as DanielInouye [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt142] would be the first Japanese member of theHouse. Yet even as these figures made essential contributions, Asian Americanswould never have a civil rights leader in the vein of Martin Luther King Jr. orCesar Chavez. This would be a curious vacuum that caused heroes and inspirationto emerge from some unexpected places.As they walked back [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt143] toward Jackson Street, Brucelooked again toward the Sun Sing Theater. He could scarcely imagine it at thetime, but the venue would mark his time in Chinatown just as it had hisfather’s. Yet he would not take the stage at the Sun Sing Theater for a fewyears, and much would happen in the interim."},{"pageContent":"3 [unp-russo-0007.xhtml#toc]THE GOOD LONG FISTSan Francisco | 1959Two blocks west of Portsmouth Square, down the steps to the other subterraneankung fu school in Chinatown, the altar within the Kin Mon[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt144] Chinese Physical Culture Studio bore theinscription:To vanquish humiliation and get revengeOne should study the martial arts industriouslyThe proper use of the good long fistIs to punish lawbreakers and to eliminate violenceWong Tim Yuen sat in [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt145] his basement studio at 142Waverly Place as he often did on most afternoons before class, smokingcigarettes and reading the newspaper. Known to some as just “T.Y.,” he looked asmeticulous as ever: neatly pressed shirt and pants, dark tie, suspenders,jet-black hair oiled back. He had well-defined features anchored around wide,inquisitive eyes, and a tall, solid frame that by itself implied proper use of“the good long fist.” The name of his school [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt146], KinMon, translated to mean “the sturdy citizen,” and T.Y. conducted himself as theembodiment of the concept.Kin Mon was located just across from the Hop Sing Tong, where, like Lau Bun,T.Y. was a long-standing member. Although he was almost[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt147] fifteen years Lau Bun’s junior, the two of themrepresented core forces of martial arts in San Francisco’s Chinatown, datingback to the early 1940s. And just as Lau Bun rendered his abilities in numerouscapacities for Hop Sing beyond just teaching, T.Y. made his own contributions aswell. During the war years, when U.S. servicemen on shore leave would frequentlytake their Forbidden City revelry too far on the streets of Chinatown, urgentdistress calls requesting Hop Sing muscle most often fell to T.Y. In an era whenfew Americans had ever heard of—much less personally encountered—kung fu, thedrunken GIs could hardly have suspected what the alleys of Chinatown were poisedto unleash on them.But those incidents were insignificant, nonsense really, compared to theencounters of T.Y.’s youth. On the wall behind him [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt148],through a mild haze of tobacco smoke, was an aged black-and-white photograph ofT.Y. as a teenager at the 1928 national martial arts exhibition in Nanjing,China. At the center of the stage stood his teacher, Leong Tin Chee, with T.Y.and senior student Chew Lung flanking him on either side. The three of them allhold martial poses: the master poised tall at the center of the trio, theacolytes baby-faced, lean, and muscular.Leong Tin Chee spent many [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt149] years at the turn of thecentury as a nomadic master who traveled the Chinese countryside conductingdemonstrations, meeting challenges, and generally seeking out martial artsaround the nation. It was in this context that a teenage T.Y. watched him as aspectator in the crowd, a witness to the makeshift wooden stage tremblingbeneath the deep power of Leong’s horse stance. Dazzled by the display, T.Y.sought out his tutelage and was taken on as his second student. He studied underLeong [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt150] for a decade, traveling China and oftenfighting in his share of brutal le tai competitions, the full-contact platformmatches that ended for many participants in serious injury or maiming. Fromlocation to location T.Y. evolved into a formidable fighter, shaped by the starkviolence of one le tai after the next.Later, during the Japanese invasion [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt151] of China,T.Y.’s father eventually found him passage to America, likely saving him fromthe fate that befell his classmate Chew Lung, who perished from a sniper’sbullet. Upon arriving in San Francisco’s [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt152] Chinatown,the Hop Sing Tong quickly recruited T.Y. for his martial arts prowess, just asit had with Lau Bun years earlier.Yet despite his old-world origin, T.Y. would eventually play a quiet role inushering in a modern and very American era for martial arts. In a grandjuxtaposition to the first photo, an adjacent image on the wall capturedstudents of Kin Mon smiling [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt153] with giddy excitementon the set of the Home show, the popular daytime NBC program with Arlene Francisand Hugh Downs, where the school performed kung fu on television in 1955(presumably for the first time in American broadcast history). It was a curiousshowing in light of the old Tong code—of not exposing martial arts to thenon-Chinese—especially from Hop Sing, of all places. But time and time again thesturdy citizen in T.Y. saw it differently. His viewpoint may have been deeplyburied beneath hard rules and a stern disposition, but in the long view ofmartial arts history T.Y. would be a pioneering force in unraveling the racialexclusion that surrounded the Chinese martial arts.More recently, he began collaborating [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt154] on aninstructional kung fu book with his senior student James Lee, who had pioneeredhis own martial arts publishing company. An English language book by a Chinesemaster was unprecedented and followed on the heels of T.Y.’s decision to allowJames Lee’s close friend and protégé Al Novak to train at Kin Mon on a regularbasis. The hulking Novak was [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt155] the first whitestudent to train within San Francisco’s Chinatown (in 1960), and T.Y. wouldmaintain the trend with a slow trickle of other non-Chinese students throughoutthe decade.Sitting there smoking between those two photographs, between NBC and Nanjing,T.Y. was a conduit linking the still-emerging modern era of martial arts to thedeep origins of old world China. After all, T.Y.’s system was Sil Lum, which inCantonese translates as Shaolin. And, as the saying goes, “All martial artsunder heaven [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt156] arose out of Shaolin.”Or so it would seem.Located along the Songshan [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt157] mountain range inChina’s Henan Province, the Shaolin Temple is one of the most famous Buddhistmonasteries on the planet. Originally constructed at the turn of the fifthcentury, the temple carries great religious significance, marking the arrival ofChan Buddhism (more often known by its Japanese name, Zen Buddhism) from Indiato China. However, Shaolin’s global fame is more readily derived from itsassociation with the Chinese martial arts, through its reputation as a kind ofkung fu Mecca. Majestically situated and mystically oriented, Shaolin isregarded in global popular culture as the storied wellspring from which theChinese martial arts have flowed to the entire world.Yet to really understand Shaolin’s martial arts legacy, it is necessary tounderstand its most notable detractor. Tang Hao was a Chinese historian[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt158] who today is scarcely known beyond a small circleof academia. Beginning with his work in the 1920s, Tang Hao was really the firstmodern historian to examine the origins of martial arts in China. Through thenumerous books and articles that he wrote, Tang Hao dismissed much of theprevailing history surrounding the Chinese martial arts as fanciful folklore,particularly with regard to Shaolin. In drawing sharp lines between mythologyand fact, Tang Hao’s work was met by the Chinese martial arts community not withinterest and gratitude but rather with hostility and outrage.It is in this precarious balance, between the much-celebrated folkloric legacyof Shaolin and the once-unwelcomed scholarship of the ostracized Tang Hao, thatthe history of the Chinese martial arts still teeters. It is a peculiar dynamicwith few parallels in the modern world, especially as Shaolin’s martial artsmythology continues to thrive well into the twenty-first century.The early folklore attributed [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt159] to Shaolin’sconnection to the martial arts is tied to the origins of Chan Buddhism in China.The popular rendering asserts that in the fifth century, the monk Bodhidharmatraveled from India to spread Buddhist teachings, and that his place ofconveyance in China was Shaolin. This made the monastery, in the words ofShaolin historian Meir Shahar, “the symbolic crossing point[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt160] between the realm of the Buddha and China.”The martial arts, as the story [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt161] goes, were abyproduct of this interaction. Noticing the adverse physical effects that longperiods of meditation were having on the monks, the Bodhidharma is said to havepassed along a series of exercises that the monks could perform to cultivatetheir physical health, stimulate their mental state of being, and (if evernecessary) employ for the defense of the monastery. Having an abundance of time,the monks honed these exercises into highly refined fighting techniques.Centuries later, when the monastery was supposedly burned to the ground by theinvading Manchus, it is believed that the handful of monks who escaped laterdisseminated their fighting techniques throughout China. This is said to haveled to the formation of a southern Shaolin Temple, which gave rise to theregional styles of the south. Over time the fighting techniques that emergedfrom Shaolin’s legacy would spread even further, eventually extending wellbeyond the borders of China to the entire world.Tang Hao dismissed much [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt162] of these Shaolin storylines as legend, particularly the notion of the Bodhidharma as the initialsource of kung fu. Through intensive research and reporting, he began theprocess of building an evidenced-based timeline regarding the origin andevolution of the Chinese martial arts that was predicated on historicaldevelopments across China’s social, military, and intellectual landscapes.Ironically, the factual history that emerges from Tang Hao’s scholarship isevery bit as compelling as the folklore.While the monastery’s connection to Chan Buddhism is sound (despite debate overthe actual existence of a Bodhidharma figure), Shaolin military activity[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt163] does not surface in the historical record until theearly part of the seventh century, when the monks successfully defended theirtemple and then their adjacent cropland from bandits. Shaolin fighting techniqueat the time was a far call from the elaborate unarmed hand-combat systems thatthey are now known for, but rather involved a sort of ritualistic black magic[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt164] in which younger monks would fight in the fieldwhile the elders would stay behind and invoke vengeful Buddhist demons toannihilate their foes.Later, when Shaolin did earn [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt165] a reputation formartial methods, it was for its practitioners’ superior aptitude in stafffighting. Under the Ming Dynasty, the Shaolin Monastery became a kind of warcollege, training future officers in a variety of combat skills. The emphasis onpole fighting (more than half the classes at Shaolin specialized in this area)conveyed a core capability for future officers who would have to train theirsoldiers in armed battlefield techniques, such as long-spear combat. Shaolinthrived in this role and gained a reputation throughout China for aspects of itsmilitary training program. However, the emphasis on staff fighting as coretraining eventually shifted around the time of the pioneering military theoriesput forth by a renowned commander.Qi Jiguang was a celebrated [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt166] Ming general, nationalhero, and arguably one of the great military minds in human history. Known forinstilling iron discipline throughout his ranks of soldiers by way of rigoroustraining methods, Qi Jiguang (pronounced gigi-kwan) had considerable impact onmilitary thought at the end of the Ming Dynasty (and on many subsequentgenerations, as well).Beginning in 1560 [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt167], Qi successfully led forces infighting off marauding pirates all along China’s east coast, enlisting peasantfarmers and miners into effective battalions with great success. Where othermilitary leaders proved impotent in dealing with the pirate threat, Qi began toscore a series of victories that, by 1564, would result in the pirateswithdrawing from China. Later he would have a successful tenure overseeing thebolstering of Great Wall defenses in the far north, preventing any Manchuincursions during his watch.Over the course of his [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt168] career, Qi published a pairof books on military strategy that would have considerable impact on traininginstitutions such as Shaolin. In his New Treatise on Military Efficiency, Qidevotes an entire chapter (with the wonderful title “Fist Canon and theEssentials of Nimbleness”) to the topic of unarmed fighting techniques and thebenefits of teaching them among the combat ranks. These skills would be[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt169] not for application on the battlefield, he argued,but for the physical conditioning of troops, and most notably, for theiracclimation to the nature of actual combat.Savvy to the prevailing military currents of the times, Shaolin adapted to thisnew viewpoint and maintained its relevance as a training institute by featuringunarmed fighting techniques as a primary part of its curriculum.As martial arts historian Ben Judkins explains: “The popularity of the unarmed[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt170] martial arts exploded [in China] between 1580 and1640. . . . Already by the 1580s some Shaolin monks were practicing boxing withthe aim of ‘perfecting’ the unarmed arts, much as they had done with the pole.”Most notably perhaps is the unique nature of the period in which these unarmedfighting styles began to emerge during the Ming Dynasty. Historians refer to it[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt171] as Ming syncretism, an era of a specialintellectual atmosphere in China, which saw a harmonious cross-pollination ofthe three great Eastern philosophies and their practices among the educatedclasses: Buddhist religious thought was combined with Confucian doctrine andintegrated with Daoist philosophy.This fostered a unique atmosphere for the Shaolin monks and other upper-echelonsegments of Ming society to contribute to the development of open-hand fightingstyles. (Despite all prevailing story lines, Shaolin wasn’t actually inventingfighting methods at all but rather absorbing them from the peasant class andhoning them in its own fashion). Within this context of Ming syncretism, traitsof Buddhist meditation, Confucian medical practices, and Daoist calisthenics allappear to have had some role in shaping and integrating the Chinese martialarts.Yet away from the elite [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt172] circles and the much betterdocumented segments of dynastic life, the peasant class in China was embroiledin day-to-day currents of violence that, in reality, contrasted profoundly withthe image of orderly dynastic society that the Ming architects were inclined toportray. Widespread banditry and other forms of petty crime, combined withflourishes of rebellion, infused common life with a degree of steady violencethat would have given the martial arts a simple and widespread relevance at thetime. The need for militias and crop-watching units, as well general protectionfor homes, businesses, and individuals was considerable.So it was on the heels of the military theories of Qi Jiguang, during theRenaissance-like atmosphere of Ming syncretism among the elite, and in thesteady and stark violence of peasant life that the unarmed fighting techniquesof the Chinese martial arts began to flourish. Despite all lingering tales ofthe Bodhidharma, this is the historical point at which Shaolin first specializedin the open-hand combat techniques for which it would be famous centuries later.And in a wider sense, it is when kung fu—as we know it in a modern sense—firstbegan to surface in the historical record in China.Throughout history the Chinese martial [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt173] arts havebeen known by many names: wushu (which translates to “martial methods”), kuoshu(“national art”), chuan fa (“boxing method”), Chinese boxing (a reference toopen-hand fighting styles, not Western boxing), and in more recent times, askung fu (meaning “effort” or “hard work”).The list of different styles and schools within the Chinese martial arts islong, varied, and extremely colorful: Tiger Claw, Buddhist Palm, NorthernPraying Mantis, Southern Praying Mantis, Monkey Style, Bear Style, WhiteEyebrow, Drunken Fist, Five Animals, Five Ancestors, Six Harmonies Boxing,Cotton Boxing, Ax-Hitch Boxing, and hundreds more. With different features,approaches, and emphasis, these styles have varying regional and familialbackgrounds and ultimately compose a diverse and expansive field of techniques.Eagle Claw, for instance, is a northern style that is grappling oriented,showcasing joint locks and pressure-point attacks. By contrast, White Crane is asouthern style known for sophisticated hand techniques applied at close rangewith swift striking motions that are derivative of its namesake animal.Conversely, the globally popular and well-known practice of tai chi chu’an isoften described as an internal or soft style of kung fu; the slow movements andmeditative nature of the art typically speaks to a greater emphasis onspiritual, mental, and energy-related concepts, as opposed to a more martialorientation.By the late nineteenth century, the otherwise obscure regional and familialfighting systems around China begin to rebrand themselves in the face of growingpeasant class interest in the martial arts. As historian Ben Judkins explains:During the early 19th century [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt174], China had a hugenumber of local fighting styles. Most of them were very small village or familyaffairs. Many of these styles did not actually have names, though there weresome notable exceptions.They were not studied so much as a particular “style” of fighting. They simplywere fighting. Later in the 19th century as the demand for martial instructionincreased, and the number of reasons it was pursued diversified, it becamenecessary to market these skills on a broader scale than had been undertaken inthe past. Names and shiny new creation myths began to appear as the fightingtechniques of the previous generation were increasingly repackaged as a “martialcommodity.”The martial brands of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries weredeveloped in a similar style to Shaolin’s creation myth of the Bodidharma as theearly source of the temple’s fighting-art tradition. Just as the Bodidharma[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt175] martial arts legend emerged long after the supposedinteraction would have taken place, many of the modern creation myths weredeveloped long after the actual genesis of most styles.As martial arts historian Brian Kennedy writes: “The goal of most martial arts[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt176] systems’ histories is to give that systemprestige—what the Chinese refer to as ‘face.’ Some hope to impress the generalpublic or prove that the system is combat-effective, while others simply aim toinspire students of the system. Still others are concerned only with relatingsome interesting folk tales. ‘Truth’ rarely factors into the equation.” Scholarsrefer to this as “invented tradition [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt177].” Bydeveloping a compelling (and often semimystical) origin story, the school orstyle could draw new students by hooking onto their martial arts imagination.Essentially, it was highly savvy advertising.For Wing Chun [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt178] it was a priestess designing astreamlined defense technique to aid a younger woman fending off a belligerentwarlord. For White Crane it was when the patriarch of a southern family tried toscare off a crane and observed the bird’s sublime movements. For Monkey style itwas when an imprisoned man observed the agile movements of primates in thenearby trees from his cell window. While some martial artists acknowledge thefolkloric nature of these stories, many others, to this day, regard them asfact.It was in an era [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt179] of ever-increasing hyperbole thatTang Hao applied a skeptical eye to the Chinese martial arts. By the late 1920sthe fledgling republican government in China had created the Central GuoshouInstitute as a formal body to promote and organize the Chinese martial arts as apillar of national physical culture. (Indeed, it was the Central GuoshouInstitute that organized the 1928 national competition in which T. Y. Wongfought and performed during his early twenties.) Following an era of widespreadmartial branding, as well as an explosion of fanciful literature, the Chinesemartial arts were ripe for a sober historical assessment. A lawyer by trade andan experienced practitioner of martial arts, Tang Hao was assigned as a leadeditor for the publication division of the Central Guoshu Institute.Like the governmental organization that he worked for, Tang Hao was a reformistwho believed that the martial arts could play a key role in the physical cultureof a modern twentieth-century China. In 1920 Tang Hao published Study of Shaolinand Wudang, in which he tackled the disparity between fact and folklore inChinese martial arts history, taking aim, as Judkins put it, “at as many sacredcows [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt180] as possible.” He dismissed the folkloresurrounding Shaolin and criticized much of the quasi mysticism that had beenattached to the martial arts in his time.Immediately, Tang’s work was received with hostility, and as a friend of hiswould later write in a memorial essay, “some ruthless and self-proclaimed[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt181] practitioners of Wudang and Shaolin made a plan toattack Tang Hao and beat him up.” This was only prevented when a reputable thirdparty intervened on his behalf (and the fact that people[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt182] within the Central Guoshu Institute didn’t defendhim, suggests he may have been insulting people in-house, as well).Later in his career he would continue to write about and promote anevidence-based history of the Chinese martial arts, debunking the highly popularbook Secrets of Shaolin Boxing and disputing the trend of invented traditions.Later, as he endured periods of bankruptcy and near homelessness during a careerthat was hardly lucrative, he continued his studies and published books alongthe same lines for close to two decades.Yet even as Tang Hao was striving to accurately portray the factual historicalorigins of the martial arts in China, these fighting systems (and theirfolklore) were already taking root in foreign nations around the globe."},{"pageContent":"4 [unp-russo-0007.xhtml#toc]THE LITTLE DRAGONOakland, California | 1959A few audience members [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt183] let loose a yelp when Bruceshot out a blast of punches. He did it again—the blur, the pop—and garnered afew more exclamations.Having caught the crowd’s attention with his dancing, Bruce was now taking theopportunity to show off his kung fu skills. He had gotten in the habit ofseizing intermission for his demonstrations (a strategy that he would employ foryears to come), and as he had been learning over the past two months, few peoplein America—even within the Chinese community—had ever heard of Wing Chun. Hiscurrent audience, at the Chinese American Citizen’s Alliance in downtownOakland, was no exception. As a result he gave them a flashy combination ofdifferent styles: “The showmanship, not the killer[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt184],” as his classmates in Hong Kong would have calledit.In the summer of 1959 [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt185], Bruce was slowly learning tonavigate his way in America. Although Mr. Quan had found him a job at the KumHon Restaurant just across from their apartment, Bruce had quickly proved thathe was poorly suited for work in the service industry, and he lasted little morethan a week. Mr. Quan, however, responded with a savvy alternative strategy: ifChinatown was the land of Forbidden City nightclubs, then surely a nationaldance champion could earn some money giving dance lessons.Bruce’s freelance employment as a dance instructor quickly gained momentum asthe local Chinese community offered him many opportunities for work, not just inChinatown but on the other side of the Bay in Oakland as well. He charged onedollar per couple and taught at local dances in the KMT Building, the Claremontand Leamington hotels, and in numerous association halls. He often made as muchas thirty dollars per outing, which, he reasoned, was pretty good money forattending a social affair.Not far from the stage [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt186], George Lee, aforty-year-old machinist from Alameda with a big Buddha-like smile, stood in aweof Bruce’s demonstration at the Citizen’s Alliance lodge. George had learnedkung fu years earlier in China, but none of what he had been taught seemed asfluid or as practical as what this kid on stage was doing. And the speed . . .it was jaw-dropping.Although Bruce appeared half his age, George quickly approached him after thedemonstrations to inquire about lessons, only to learn that Bruce was leavingthe Bay Area soon to attend school in Seattle.“Any chance you’ll come back [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt187] here?” George asked.“Because I can get some people together and you could open a school.”Bruce had already considered the idea while traveling to the United States. Withonly five years’ experience in Wing Chun, he couldn’t have dreamed of teachingin Hong Kong, but in the sparse martial arts landscape of America, it wasappearing increasingly possible. Before Bruce could reiterate the priority ofhis studies in Seattle, George inquired further.“What style were you doing [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt188] on stage, with thepunches?”“It is Wing Chun,” Bruce explained with pride, “from Hong Kong.”Located along China’s southern [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt189] coast, Hong KongIsland sits at the base of the Pearl River Delta eighty miles from Canton in theSouth China Sea. Once a sparsely populated fishing village that England’sforeign secretary dismissed in the early nineteenth century as a “barren island[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt190],” Hong Kong was eventually taken as a Britishcolony in the wake of the First Opium War. Like San Francisco what had startedas a remote port (of only about seven thousand inhabitants at the time ofBritish possession in 1841) would experience a huge influx[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt191] of settlers around 1850, when Hong Kong receivedvast numbers of refugees fleeing the civil war struggle of the TaipingRebellion. In 1860, with Hong Kong’s population surpassing one hundred thousand,China also ceded control of Kowloon, the adjacent mainland peninsula, which wassubsequently integrated by the British into the colony.The place that developed [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt192] over the next century wasoverpopulated, racially diverse, and heavily influenced by geopoliticalcurrents. In time the colony would become a dense metropolis marked by tightlypacked skyscrapers (the most vertical city in the world) as well as an intricatefinance and banking system that would become a key component of the globaleconomy.In the spring of 1941, Hoi Cheun and Grace [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt193] hadreturned home to Hong Kong from San Francisco and introduced their otherchildren, Phoebe, Agnes, and Peter, to their pudgy five-month-old baby brother,Bruce (their youngest child, Robert, would be born years later). They hadarrived home [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt194] during World War II in the tumultuousatmosphere of the Pacific theater, where the Japanese invasion of mainland Chinain the summer of 1937 instituted a brutal campaign against the civilianpopulation and quickly sent waves of refugees into the British colony. In 1938alone half a million people flooded into Hong Kong as Japanese forces sweptthrough Canton and the rest of nearby Guandong Province. The inevitable finallycame on December 7, 1941, when Japanese forces toppled the British colony withlittle resistance during the same offensive that simultaneously launched anattack on the American fleet in Hawaii’s Pearl Harbor. The occupation thatfollowed [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt195] lasted until the summer of 1945 andinvolved widespread food shortages, loss of public utilities, and the generaldisruption of day-to-day society.The Le family weathered [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt196] this period at their homeon Nathan Road in the Kowloon section of Hong Kong, with a Japanese militaryencampment directly across from them. Nonetheless, Hoi Cheun’s wealth from hisacting career got them through the war without incident, and his return to showbusiness in its aftermath afforded his children an affluent upbringing in aplace where rampant poverty was readily on display. With the passing of hisbrother [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt197], Hoi Cheun held firm to tradition by takingin his sister-in-law and her five kids, effectively creating a rambunctious andnoisy home environment swarming with children and pets. For as rigid as he couldbe with Bruce over the years, Hoi Cheun was a generous man who often intervenedfinancially to help friends and family.After becoming smitten with him [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt198] from her orchestraseat at the opera, Grace had eloped with Hoi Cheun at a young age. Althoughraised in Shanghai [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt199], she belonged to the veryprominent and multiethnic Hong Kong family of the Ho Tung-Bosman clan. Hergrandfather, Charles Maurice Bosman, was a prosperous Dutch merchant and consulwith a wide range of business ventures throughout Hong Kong. He married aChinese woman, Lady Tze, and had several children, including Robert Ho Tong, whowould become a well-known philanthropist and businessman and is historicallyregarded as a Hong Kong incarnation of Andrew Carnegie. Grace’s father was HoKom Tong, who in photographs looks noticeably full-blooded Chinese compared tohis very Eurasian-looking siblings, and was likely the offspring of an affairthat Lady Tze had with a Chinese servant.Ho Kom Tong made an already labyrinth-like family tree exceedingly horizontal byhaving seventeen kids with numerous wives and concubines. A recent book writtenby Ho Kom Tong’s great nephew, Eric Peter Ho, on the subject of their familytree, refers to Grace as “the final piece in the jigsaw[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt200] of Ho Kom-tong’s family,” citing her as thedaughter of his mixed-race Shanghai mistress. Yet even as it is typically citedthat one of her parents was German, Grace’s exact racial makeup[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt201] remains ambiguous. In fact, during interviews withU.S. immigration officials prior to leaving San Francisco in 1941, Graceformally stated that her father was Chinese and her mother was English. Whateverthe particulars, Bruce descended from a Hong Kong family in which racialintegration had long been regarded as a nonissue.Grace and Hoi Chuen’s first son [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt202] had died shortlyafter childbirth, a bad omen in Chinese tradition that stoked great fears inthem about displeased ancestral spirits. More than just some casualsuperstition, this would play out in tangible ways over the years. Since thesebeliefs implied that the second child should be a girl, they adopted Phoebe inan effort to put the procession into proper order. With Bruce there existed ageneral concern that the spirits sought to take away Grace’s sons, so in aneffort to confuse them, he was often referred to at home by the female name SaiFan (meaning “Little Peacock”). This gender misdirection played out in colorfulways during his early years with girl’s clothing and an earring right up untilhis ninth birthday, when it was deemed that the spirits had been adequatelyoutmaneuvered.With the 1949 victory [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt203] of the Communist Party inChina, Hong Kong experienced a renewed influx of refugees, this time fleeingtheir own countrymen rather than an invading force. (Oddly enough, Chairman Maoechoed the early British foreign secretaries when he dismissed Hong Kong as “awasteland of an island [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt204].”) With Communist control ofChina, nearly a million Chinese people fled to Hong Kong in this period,overwhelming an already overpopulated area and severely impacting life in thecolony. As Bruce’s childhood friend Hawkins [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt205] Cheungwould later reflect: “Hong Kong in the 1950s was a depressed place. Post–WorldWar II Hong Kong had suffered from unemployment, a poor economy, over-crowding,homelessness, and people taking advantage of each other. Gangs roamed thestreet, and juvenile delinquents ran rampant.” This environment contrastedstarkly [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt206] with the wealth and privilege that HoiCheun provided his family at home. It was a dichotomy that was literally evidentat their front door, where they would often find homeless people sleeping intheir entryway. In this regard Bruce came of age in a curious dynamic of comfortby way of a movie star father set against the looming poverty and strife of hisurban environment. It would shape him in his early years and steer him tomartial arts.As a child Bruce was as bright as he was rambunctious. His family nicknamed himmo si tung, meaning [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt207] “never sits still,” as hisearly years kept his mother constantly occupied. Later, the sum total[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt208] of his mischievous personality, stubborndisposition, and hyperactive body would eventually get him expelled before hewas a teen from the English-language La Salle Intermediate College. His parentsthen rerouted him to the equally prestigious St. Francis Xavier College, whereBruce continued to dig out his share of mischief and trouble.In the Kowloon section [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt209] of Hong Kong in the early1950s, mischief and trouble ran rampant on many fronts. In addition to the largehomeless population fending for itself, many teenagers who failed to pass anentry exam into the colony’s secondary school system were left with merely anelementary-level education in the face of a consistently languid economy. Adriftwith little prospects of employment, they formed juvenile gangs and perpetrateda wide range of petty crimes on the streets. Further exacerbating thisenvironment, Hong Kong had also inherited vast numbers of professional gangsterswho had fled Communist persecution on the mainland, and who now perpetrated afar more serious and organized form of local vice within the colony.Bruce exhibited a tough [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt210] disposition in his earlyyears, often rallying his preteen friends to scrap with the British boys fromthe nearby King George V School. Even still, he had traits that could provemagnetic to bullies: he was physically small and possessed pretty-boy good looksto match his movie-star privilege. Although his family didn’t blink at racialintegration, his mixed heritage was yet another point of contention whennavigating the gauntlet of Kowloon’s streets. It was this constant day-to-daystreet strife that would spark his initial interest in martial arts.Many of Bruce’s classmates [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt211] at St. Francis Xavierwere already studying with a master whose studio was close to the school. Theteacher was known for a style that was modern, easy to learn, and—best ofall—had a reputation for being effective on the streets. Although few of themcould conceive of it at the time, this master would become a martial arts legendin his own right.The combined impact of Japan’s [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt212] 1937 invasion ofChina and the subsequent Communist victory in 1949 caused a widespreaddislodging of the mainland population. Families who had lived in one place forgenerations suddenly had to relocate to other parts of the country or even theworld. In the process China’s martial arts masters were also reshuffled fromtheir places of origin, taking their regionally based styles to areas where theyhad never previously been encountered. Furthermore, in a Marxist effort towardmodernization, Mao banned China’s martial arts practices as an antiquated andsuperstitious tradition. It was in this context that the colony of Hong Kong sawan array of kung fu masters from all over China brought into unprecedentedproximity for the first time.Ip Man arrived [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt213] in Hong Kong in 1950, penniless,widowed, and close to sixty years old. The son of a wealthy merchant, he wasraised in prosperity and privilege on a manor farm in the southern town ofFoshan, where as a teen he studied an obscure southern style of kung fu known asWing Chun. After continuing his training during secondary school in Hong Kong,he returned to an idyllic lifestyle on his family’s estate at the age of twenty.Like many of his countrymen, he found life as he knew it upended in the waryears, as the Japanese invasion of World War II steadily eroded his wealth andsecurity. Having worked as a policeman for the Nationalist Forces, Ip Maneventually fled southern China in the face of the Communist victory and, intime, made a living in Hong Kong teaching his one great skill.Economical, swift, and direct [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt214], Wing Chun has littleof the flare seen in some other kung fu styles. There are no acrobatic forms orgrand, sweeping movements, just stripped down techniques seeking an almostmathematical effectiveness in their application. The emphasis on “in-fighting”positions the practitioner to attack along the opponent’s centerline, oftenusing short kicks and flurries of quick punches in close proximity. In Hong Kongthe simplicity and streamlined nature of the style often proved itself mosteffective during the rapid chaos of a street fight.The folk history attached [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt215] to Wing Chun asserts thata priestess of the southern Shaolin temple had designed the style to be employedby a female peasant who needed to fend off an aggressive suitor. This notion,that the style was developed for females by females, would only add to WingChun’s reputation as a singularly unique incarnation of kung fu.Ip Man’s approach [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt216], like the style he taught, wasall based on minimalism. Unlike many other masters (such as Lau Bun, forinstance), he had no interest in the more peripheral traditions of Chinesemartial arts, such as medicine or Lion Dancing. His art’s purpose was for theboiled-down intention of combat effectiveness, and in postwar Hong Kong, thatwould work just fine.At the time Ip Man was slowly getting his business running in the early 1950s,Wing Chun was an obscurity, and he was one of the last known accomplishedpractitioners of it in China.Bruce had taken up [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt217] Wing Chun with Ip Man in theKowloon section of Hong Kong in 1954 at the age of thirteen and set himself toit with a fanatical ambition. His peers marveled at not only how hard Brucetrained but also how single-minded he became in his devotion to learning. Brucecommitted only sporadic diligence to his studies at St. Francis Xavier each day,but he never skipped a Wing Chun class and put in dedicated hours while he wasthere. Outside class he got into the habit of practicing his punches whileholding dumbbells and filling his walks to school with sharp kicks toundeserving trees along the way. Even while sitting at the dinner table, hewould occasionally throw out a punch to some phantom opponent. His classmatessaddled him with the nickname “Upstart [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt218],” while IpMan’s son referred to him as “fighting crazy [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt219].”However, the atmosphere between students in Ip Man’s studio could be casuallycontentious, as ego and competitiveness drove them to outdo one another. Youngerstudents sought to glean techniques that were above their skill set, so thatthey would have an advantage against their rivals. As Hawkins Cheung put it,“Everyone wanted to be [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt220] top dog.”A core practice [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt221] of Wing Chun training is thesensitivity drill of chi sao (“sticking hands”), in which two practitioners moveinterlocked hands and forearms to develop contact reflex. This exercise seeks toimbue Wing Chun practitioners with keen awareness of the movement and balance ofan opponent, allowing for disruption and the ability to counter any attack. Inclass students engaging in chi sao had the opportunity to best a rival bylanding a solid blow in the process. Like every other aspect of his training,Bruce took to chi sao practice with considerable zeal.But his industriousness was a trait that soon backfired on him, when olderstudents took offense at being bested by a fledgling practitioner during chisao. They responded by pointing [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt222] out Bruce’smixed-race heritage to Ip Man, citing it as a violation of Chinese martial artsetiquette, and urging his dismissal. Ip Man was reluctantly obligated to do sobut found a loophole by allowing two of his most senior students, William Cheungand Wong Sheun Leoung, to continue Bruce’s training on the side. For Bruce theissue of his mixed-race ancestry, as well as this Chinese-only code, wouldsurface again and again for many years to come.In training now with [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt223] the senior students, Bruce wasgiven a more hands-on view of fighting, in which the streets of Hong Kong wereoften employed as the perfect environment for an extended bit of martial artspractice. With the colony housing [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt224] a variety ofinstructors, students would test the legitimacy of what their masters wereteaching against practitioners from other schools. This grew into a culture initself, since many of the gangs on the streets of Hong Kong were affiliated witha particular style of kung fu. As a result a street fight was never hard tofind, and as the challenge culture grew between rival styles, the colony’spolice force began to regard these young martial artists as deviant youth gangsengaging in illegal violence. In response the teens began taking the fights offthe streets and up to the rooftops, where they could find a decent amount ofspace and conduct their showdowns uninterrupted.The “rooftop fights” of Hong Kong in this period became a unique fightingculture all its own, and Ip Man’s Wing Chun students made a name for themselveswithin it. “As he taught us [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt225],” Hawkins explains,“Yip Man said, ‘Don’t believe me . . . Go out and have a fight. Test it out.’”This facet of Bruce’s [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt226] Hong Kong training wouldforever shape his martial arts philosophy as William Cheung and Wong SheunLeoung kept him in firsthand proximity to the hard realities of actual streetfighting. He saw what worked versus what was mere extravagance, and he got asense for the peripheral factors—stamina, instinct, and grit—that transcendedboth fighting technique and theory. In the short term, however, it meantscrapes, black eyes, and calls from the police. As a result Bruce’s teen yearswere marked by navigating the wrath of his father as much as the wrath of rivalgangs. His sister Agnes notes [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt227] that Bruce didn’tcope well with coming out on the losing end of a street clash, and theunbearable anguish of such losses manifested in his drive to train harder andharder. If it was a matter of being unbeatable, Bruce reckoned, he would work tobecome unbeatable.This deep-seated drive [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt228] and ambition began to payoff during some of Bruce’s more innocuous pursuits as well, such as hislate-teen championships in boxing and dancing. While his victories in the ringcould be seen as a convenient extracurricular (and less troublesome) context toapply Wing Chun–style punches, his interest in cha-cha dancing was quite genuineand fit nicely with his social scene at St. Francis Xavier.Bruce also thrived [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt229] in the acting roles that hisfather got him, and beginning from the age of about six, Bruce had over twentyroles in Hong Kong films, billed under the name Lee Siu Loong—Lee Little Dragon.In the face of his street mischief, these more positive accomplishments roundedout the polar extremes of Bruce’s adolescent behavior. He could be gregarious[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt230], charming, and highly motivated. Although never astar in the classroom, he was an avid reader of books and a devoted student ofthe philosophical side of Ip Man’s teaching. Conversely, he could seem arrogantand egotistical, with an antagonistic streak that quickly created enemies. Thesetraits had gotten him expelled from a prestigious school and increasingly placedhim on the radar of local law enforcement. This duality would mark Bruce’ssocial relations for years to come and create both lifelong friends and bitterenemies.“He was a little hyper [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt231], but a lot of fun,” explainshis childhood friend Ben Der. “I liked him a lot; he was very honest and veryhumorous. But if you didn’t know him, you could get the idea that he was toococky and too much of a showoff.”Whatever the exact balance, the sum total of these features would eventuallybring his childhood to an abrupt end. Fellow students assert[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt232] that it was Bruce who picked the particular fightthat would prompt his return to San Francisco. It was a rooftop bout set upagainst a member of a rival Choy Li Fut school and had been arranged by seniorstudents to last two rounds. Bruce took multiple punches to the face during thefirst round, and during the break in between, he urged his classmates to stopthe fight, since he wouldn’t be able to hide his wounds from his dad. Convincedto keep going, Bruce rallied back and beat his opponent to the ground invictory. Shortly afterward the parents of his vanquished foe wasted little timein contacting the police.Popular urban mythology [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt233] asserts that the true issuewith Bruce’s victory was that his opponent was actually the son of a well-knowngangster and therefore Bruce’s departure to the United States was predicated ondire circumstances. Whatever the specifics [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt234], theserun-ins had been serious enough that before Bruce or Hawkins could obtainoverseas visas, their parents were forced to first wrangle with the authorities(purportedly in the form of a bribe) to get their children removed from a listof known local troublemakers.With high school graduation [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt235] approaching, jail wasappearing as likely as college. For Grace and Hoi Chuen, the decision to sendBruce to the United States was not a difficult one.Bruce walked along [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt236] Portsmouth Square in the earlysummer evening, as the sun slumped west behind Nob Hill. Like anyone else inChinatown interested in martial arts, he had been eventually pointed in thedirection of Lau Bun.If Bruce’s time in San Francisco had started with uncertainty and insecurity, hewas now approaching the entrance to Hung Sing with his Hong Kong swagger back inorder. Perhaps it was all the praise he was receiving after his demonstrationsat the local dances. Or maybe the fact that during his last big fight in HongKong, he had been victorious against a practitioner of Choy Li Fut, the stylethat was being taught by Lau Bun at the bottom of the stairs. Whatever the case,he descended those steps far too quickly and with more zeal than humility,clueless not only to the fact that Lau Bun had been teaching longer than even IpMan but that Bruce was hardly the first hotshot to come down with something toprove.“When Bruce came to [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt237] Hung Sing, he didn’t knowanything about San Francisco,” recounts Sam Louie, one of Lau Bun’s seniorstudents at the time. “There were 7 or 8 of us in class. He came down to showoff some hands, and tried to say to us that Wing Chun was the best. So our sifuthrew him out.”Lau Bun could surmise by the heated language coming over the partition that hehad an interloper in Hung Sing. The school had had its share of them over theyears, and in his younger days he may have been more inclined to engage them.(Once, during a particularly contentious incident, he whispered to a seniorstudent, “Don’t worry; if you lose [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt238], I’ll take himout.”)The reputation of the Hong Kong Wing Chun students had preceded Bruce to SanFrancisco’s Chinatown. Long before Bruce had returned to America, Ip Man’steenage students [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt239] were already regarded in SanFrancisco Chinatown as disrespectful, belligerent, and (in the eyes of HungSing, at least) horribly overrated. Lau Bun had governed the Chinatown martialarts culture for years, preventing it from devolving into the sort of unrulyfight culture that had emerged in Hong Kong. He had no intention of thatchanging any time soon.The room went quiet [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt240] as Lau Bun stepped into thepractice studio, and the look of alarm and consequence on the faces of theyounger students quickly conveyed to Bruce the gravity of the situation. Theolder students looked to their teacher for permission.“Don’t bother [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt241],” he barked, in abrupt Cantonese.Lau Bun peered down at Bruce with condescension and hostility from behind thickglasses. He spoke slowly and deliberately.“Did your teacher [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt242] allow you talk like that at hisschool in Hong Kong?”Bruce stammered, realizing now he was in over his head. Lau Bun pressed him.“There is no street talk in here,” he said. “Take your mouth back up to thestreet.”Bruce hesitated. Lau Bun pressed again.“Now!”Bruce stormed back up the stairs. Smirks surfaced on the faces of the olderstudents, as relief emerged on those of the younger ones. In both short- andvery long-term contexts, Chinatown’s martial arts scene would remember thisincident with Bruce . . . among others . . . for years to come.Just as when he was a newborn, Bruce spent only a few months in San Franciscobefore moving on. But he had begun to make a name for himself, for better orworse, in Chinatown . . . and slowly, in Oakland as well. For now he was on hisway to Seattle."},{"pageContent":"5 [unp-russo-0007.xhtml#toc]THE SOFT ARTSSan Francisco | 1960At the start [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt243] of the 1960s, the Asian martial artswere still largely an obscurity in America, though to varying degrees. TheJapanese art of judo had enjoyed some international popularity throughout thecentury, and in many ways was the best known and established of the arts inAmerica. The Okinawan striking art of karate had made inroads among U.S.servicemen stationed overseas during the past two decades and was quicklygaining popularity in recent years. The Chinese martial arts, on the other hand,were almost entirely unknown at the time Bruce Lee returned to America from HongKong in 1959.In San Francisco, Chinatown began the decade with little variation to its ownwell-established structure of the neighborhood’s insular kung fu culture. LauBun’s Hung Sing and T. Y. Wong’s Kin Mon were familiar institutions in thecommunity and were moving into their third decade of local operation. Theirpresence within [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt244] Chinatown was most noticeableduring Chinese holidays, neighborhood festivals, and business openings, whentheir schools would perform lion dance ceremonies as a ritualistic blessing (inwhich “the spirit of the lion [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt245] chases away evilspirits”). This made them not only visible but also essential to the spiritualcustoms and traditions of the community.However, there was a third and final foundation to the neighborhood’s martialarts culture, which was less visible yet every bit as relevant. The Gee YauSeah—“The Soft Arts Academy”—was located down Old Chinatown Lane, a narrow andinconspicuous alleyway along the ascending slope of Washington Street. Known tomany longtime residents as “Horse Stable Alley [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt246],”Old Chinatown Lane extends northward between closely situated apartmentbuildings deep into unseen Chinatown. It was there, in the furthest recesses ofChinatown, that the Gee Yau Seah was located. Far less a formal[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt247] school environment than Hung Sing or Kin Mon, theGee Yau Seah was more a gathering place, a martial arts social club with anemphasis on the soft arts of kung fu. Appropriately enough, it was formed aroundthe same time as the neighborhood’s other two martial arts institutions.In 1939 the Chinese Consolidated [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt248] BenevolentAssociation funded Choy Hak Pang, an accomplished practitioner of Yang style taichi chuan, to relocate from Hong Kong to San Francisco to provide a source ofexercise and recreation for its local members. Choy was a student of celebratedmaster Yang Chengu Fu, and his arrival in San Francisco[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt249] is often heralded as the start of formal tai chiinstruction in the United States.While in Chinatown [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt250] he established the Gee Yau Seah,modeling it on a similar tai chi social club founded years earlier in Shanghai.Choy traveled often to teach in other Chinese communities around the UnitedStates and founded similar clubs in New York and Los Angeles. After close to adecade of instruction within San Francisco (and around America), Choy returnedwith his family to Hong Kong in 1947, where he continued to teach, and where hiscareer took another fascinating turn in the form of a very unexpected student.Gerda Geddes was born [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt251] in 1917 to upper-classsociety in Norway, the daughter of a prominent national politician. As a youngwoman she gravitated toward prewar bohemian life in Oslo, training as a dancerand mingling with the local art world. She studied the teachings ofcontroversial psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich during her time at the University ofOslo and joined the resistance against the Nazis in her midtwenties. With theadvent of World War II, she narrowly evaded the Third Reich after a series ofdramatic encounters. Escaping to Sweden hidden beneath a cart of lumber, shewould have seemed an unlikely (or perhaps perfectly sensible) candidate to oneday play a notable role in spreading Chinese martial arts around the world.Her marriage in the postwar years brought her to Shanghai, where her husbandheld a new business position. Early one morning Geddes became transfixedwatching an old man perform slow dance-like movements in the misty predawn hoursalongside a canal. Like most other Europeans, she had no concept of or exposureto tai chi. At the time Geddes had been exploring ways to merge dancing with heruniversity studies in psychoanalysis to develop a sort of physically orientedmental therapy. Now, watching tai chi in Shanghai, she felt as if she no longerhad to invent it, since the Chinese had already cultivated it for centuries. Sherecalled, “As I watched I had [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt252] a sensation of hotand cold streaming up and down my spine . . . and I remember thinking, ‘This iswhat I have been looking for all my life.’”Held under virtual house arrest in Shanghai for two years following theCommunist victory in China, Geddes and her family were eventually allowed entryto Hong Kong. There in the mid-1950s she approached Choy Hak Pang with aninterest in studying tai chi. When she performed an interpretive dance for Choyand his colleague, her efforts were met with much confusion: “They did not seem[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt253] very impressed,” she said. “In fact, they indicatedthat most of what I did was bad for the body in one way or another.” Despite anymisgivings, Geddes seems to have won Choy over and soon began training with himfive days a week.In the same culture [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt254] and in the same time periodthat a young teenage Bruce Lee was demoted from Ip Man’s school for his mixedracial heritage, the elder Choy’s decision to take a European woman as a studentwas nothing short of revolutionary. Classes were in private[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt255], and there was an unspoken rule of no physicalcontact. Geddes learned under Choy until his death the following year, when shethen began studying under his son, Choy Kam Man, who at first proved verynervous interacting with an older European woman.The younger Choy’s martial [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt256] arts evolution was initself a fascinating trajectory. Engaged in the Hong Kong street-fightingculture of the 1950s as a teen, Choy lifted weights and excelled at SouthernMantis style (learning under local master Yip Shui), but only practiced tai chireluctantly at the insistence of his father. However, he soon began to noticethat the softer arts were benefiting his martial abilities in tangible ways.This awareness culminated in an experience that would shape the younger Choy’scareer, when he had a sort of transcendental experience while practicing tai chialone one afternoon, feeling as if his body had “disappeared[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt257]” in the process. As he committed more time topractice, the experiences continued. He confided not in his father but in otherpractitioners and meditation instructors, who collectively congratulated him forfinding true balance in the yin/yang. Subsequently, the younger Choy felt thathis skills were evolving well beyond petty street fights and weight lifting.Soon he anchored all his martial focus around the perfection of the soft arts.Geddes trained with the younger Choy for a year before returning to England,intent on introducing tai chi to Europe (in 1960 she even had a brief segmentperforming [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt258] on the BBC). However, Geddes wasroutinely met [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt259] with widespread disinterest andbewilderment. She finally found her niche a few years later when she integratedtai chi into her teaching curriculum at the London Contemporary Dance School,where she would teach for the next thirty years.(Interestingly enough, this [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt260] nearly exact scenariohad played out with American-born Sophia Delza just a few years earlier. Born toa liberal and artistically minded family in New York City, Delza studied danceas a young adult and eventually accompanied her husband, a UN diplomat, on hisnew assignment in Shanghai. Like Geddes she successfully sought out a Chinesetai chi instructor. Whereas Geddes learned Yang-style tai chi and returned toteach in London, Delza learned Wu style and returned to teach for years in NewYork City, at the United Nations and Carnegie Hall. It is one of those peculiarhistorical synchronicities without any direct connection.)Meanwhile, the younger Choy [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt261] returned to SanFrancisco, where he took up his father’s legacy in Chinatown within the Gee YauSeah, continuing to teach Yang-style tai chi in America. Handsome and studiousin appearance, Choy Kam Man—or, as he became known around the neighborhood:Master Choy—rounded out the small group of teachers in Chinatown at the start ofthe 1960s. Younger, low-key, and unaffiliated with the Hop Sing Tong, Choy was aquiet contrast to the status quo of Lau Bun and T. Y. Wong. Although Choy was ateacher of tai chi, his martial abilities would leave the rare witness in awe.“Master Choy could fold [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt262] space and time,” explainsformer student Jack Wada. “His movements defied a certain logic. It was as if hecould worm-hole his way with a punch or kick. You might see it start, then itwould be in and you would pick it up on the way out.”Choy lived in a tiny [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt263] apartment on Stockton Streetwith a large family that had a penchant for taking in stray canines. At anygiven point in the day, their home was a cramped riot of screaming children andbarking dogs. Yet Choy never had a proper tai chi studio of his own to retreatto. In addition to the Gee Yau Seah, he taught for years at the YMCA onSacramento Street, where like the other neighborhood masters, his enrollment wassteady, though hardly booming. This changed as the decade picked up momentum,and both martial arts and San Francisco’s youth culture gained prominence. Inthe late sixties, Master Choy would draw a large and loyal following ofnon-Chinese students, young San Franciscans, and recent transplants who didn’tbuy into the era’s well-known subculture gurus but still sought new avenuestoward spirituality, or at least peace of mind.Within the neighborhood [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt264], however, this followingwould eventually earn Master Choy threatening calls in the dead of night,warning him to stop teaching Chinese secrets to other races, almost twenty yearsafter his father first taught Geddes in Hong Kong. Although known as a teacherof soft style, Master Choy would eventually fend off his critics by taking ahard-line stance.A genuine glimpse [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt265] of Old World kung fu could befound with another well-known figure of the Gee Yau Seah, who in his old age hadbecome a legendary figure in early American martial arts circles. Almost twentyyears a senior of his close friend Lau Bun, Mah Sek was a well-respected masterwith a benevolent glow who possessed strange and amazing abilities to match hislong and colorful history. Born in a rural Chinese enclave of the SacramentoDelta region in 1876, Mah Sek was sent back to China at the age of seven to livewith an uncle in Canton. Once a Shaolin monk, his uncle had assumed a newidentity after killing an opponent in a martial arts challenge and becoming afugitive of the law. Mah Sek was trained by his uncle from a young age inold-style Shaolin kung fu, before returning to San Francisco as a young man. Hewatched Chinatown burn in the 1906 earthquake and later worked as an instructorand enforcer for a tong in nearby Stockton. Like his uncle before him, he killeda man in hand-to-hand combat and spent years lying low of the law. Hisopponent’s death weighed heavily on him and spurred him to refute using martialarts for the purpose of fighting.In the years that followed, Mah Sek turned his martial arts abilities inward andused them to showcase feats of the body, becoming a sort of martial arts acrobatand contortionist who would enthrall spectators at demonstrations for years tocome. He was a master of Qi Gong, the internal art of cultivating the humanbody’s intrinsic energy. Long an esoteric concept that dates back to Chineseantiquity, notions of Qi (natural energy or life force) would be integrated intomedicine, religion, and martial arts throughout Chinese history.Mah Sek combined his Qi Gong abilities to his iron body training, the kung fupractice of hardening parts of the body through constant and extremely arduousphysical conditioning. Over time Mah Sek had rendered his body malleable andimpervious, becoming “like a hard rubber ball [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt266]”capable of withstanding any blow. His Iron Shirt [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt267] QiGong demonstrations were legendary in early American martial arts circles, as hewithstood body blows from crushing weights and sharp weapons with no injury.Historically, martial arts [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt268] street performers wereregarded as the bottom rung of the culture’s hierarchy in China, stigmatized asa mixture of charlatans and kung fu circus freaks. Yet they played a key role asprovocateurs of the martial arts imagination. In this sense Mah Sek representedtangible evidence, well into the twentieth century, that perhaps the Old Worldstories were in fact true, that the limits to a true master’s abilities wereseemingly boundless.Yet even as these old masters held sway over Chinatown’s martial arts landscapeat the start of the decade, a more modern era was inevitably set to dawn. Andthe incident—the fight—that would significantly shape martial art’s biggest nameof this coming era would be born of the alleyways of San Francisco’s Chinatown.Yet for all the grit and badass reputation of Lau Bun’s Hung Sing and T.Y.’s KinMon, the showdown would emerge instead from Old Chinatown Lane, from within theGee Yau Seah."},{"pageContent":"6 [unp-russo-0007.xhtml#toc]THREE MOVES OR LESSSeattle, Washington | 1960Bruce let Jesse Glover [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt269] know. Enough was enough. Hewould fight his critic.Deferring to his Hong Kong instincts, Bruce sought to fight on the roof of theschool. Glover talked him away from campus and instead set the fight for thecourtyard of the nearby YMCA.Glover was Bruce’s [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt270] first student in Seattle. Justas George Lee had approached Bruce after his demonstration at the ChineseAmerican Citizen’s Alliance, so too had interested observers begun to shake outof the crowd during Bruce’s showcases up in Seattle, magnetized by the abilityand power of this small nineteen-year-old Chinese kid. Glover was the first toinquire about learning from Bruce. As an African American teen growing up inSeattle, Glover had been brutalized by a drunken police officer. Now in hismidtwenties, he was interested in martial arts for the sole purpose of exactingrevenge on his attacker, and Jesse approached Bruce already having anaccomplished background in judo and boxing.Not long afterward [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt271], James Demile cast a skepticaleye toward Bruce during an Asian heritage festival at Edison Technical School,where they were both completing their high school educations. Demile, ofmixed-race ancestry, went from a hard childhood in an orphanage, to a long listof teenage gang fights, to a stint of boxing while in the air force. He joined acrowd of spectators to watch this sharply dressed Chinese student perform apeculiar physical routine. When Demile heard the student bill the demonstrationas “deadly” Asian fighting techniques [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt272], he was asamused as he was skeptical.“Bruce looked about as dangerous [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt273] as Don Knotts,”Demile recalls. “It was a beautiful performance, sort of a cross between balletand mime, but it sure didn’t look like fighting.”At one point during the festival demonstration, Bruce feared he was losing thecrowd’s interest, so he called Demile—the biggest guy in the crowd—forward sothat he could demonstrate.“You look like you [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt274] can fight,” Bruce stated. “Hitme as hard as you can.”Weighing close to one hundred pounds more than Bruce, Demile (who was actuallyon probation at the time) was half worried he might kill the kid. When hefinally obliged, Bruce moved around him in a blur, locking Demile’s arms againsteach other with the Wing Chun trapping technique of lop sau (the pulling hand),effectively neutralizing any chance for his much larger opponent to land a blow.As Demile would recount years later: “I felt myself being jolted[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt275] as he flicked my jab aside, caught my other arm,and in a flowing motion planted both arms crossed on my chest like I was dead.In an act of panic I tried to leap back and away from him. He was like a badsmell, I could not get away. No matter how I moved, backwards or side to side,he stayed with me while maintaining pressure on my locked arms. I finallystopped when I hit the edge of the stage.” Finally, just to assert his dominanceof the situation, Bruce began tapping on Demile’s head like an older siblingtorturing a little brother on a lackluster Saturday afternoon, asking, “Hello?Is there anybody home? [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt276]” Humbled, Demile quicklyrealized he could learn some things from Bruce.More students soon followed [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt277], like Skip Ellsworth,who grew up as the only white kid on an Indian reservation, fighting NativeAmerican youths on a daily basis amid dismal poverty. Another was Taky Kimura, athirty-six-year-old Japanese American whose self-worth had been adrift since hisinternment during World War II. These men were among the scrappy bunch ofblue-collar street fighters who composed Bruce’s first class in the early 1960s.One by one, they had been thunderstruck after witnessing Bruce’s abilities.At nineteen Bruce would [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt278] never have been allowed toteach back in Hong Kong. Given that Bruce had only five years’ experience andlimited mastery of Wing Chun, the very idea would have been laughable to theaging masters who populated the postwar colony. But on the West Coast in 1960,Bruce arrived unaligned with the Chinese martial arts racial-exclusion code thathe himself had been a victim of while in his teens. Bruce’s younger-generationworldview provided an opportunity for a modern class environment, where therules could be freely rewritten. The result was the most[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt279] racially diverse group of students in the historyof the Chinese martial arts to that point, another evolutionary step forwardfrom the high-water mark of Geddes and the Choy family (among very few others,such as Sophia Delza). When Ruby Chow, the stern [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt280]female restaurant owner who provided Bruce with employment and lodging,expressed disdain for his teaching of non-Chinese students, Bruce didn’thesitate to dispute the issue with her.Bruce was settling nicely [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt281] into Seattle. He waspoised to receive his high school diploma and begin college classes at theUniversity of Washington, where he would study philosophy. Away from school hehoped that his informal martial arts classes (they often practiced in parks,parking structures, and alleyways) could in time develop into a more legitimatebusiness and liberate him from his menial hours bussing tables at Ruby Chow’srestaurant (an arrangement that he regarded as a sort of indentured servitude).Yet more than just teaching, Bruce was tangibly benefiting from the situation aswell. His class of street-tough Seattle students enabled him to acclimate to anentirely new cross section of opponents. As Glover would later put it, “We wereall dummies [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt282] for Bruce to train on.” In this regardhis abilities were progressing as much as those of his own students.Open to drawing on more [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt283] than just classical WingChun, Bruce began to evolve what he was practicing. He did so to adjust to thesize of Western opponents and to achieve progress that was no longer availablethrough traditional study with a teacher such as Ip Man. It was an approach—akind of permanent evolution—that would last the rest of his life, characterizehis own art, and eventually help him create a new paradigm in the field itself.At the moment, however [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt284], Bruce’s credibility wasbeing called into question. He had been harassed lately—at demonstrations, inthe cafeteria, in the hallways—by a Japanese student and karate practitionernamed Yoiche Nakachi, who considered Bruce’s abilities a farce. Once the hotheadwilling to jump at any challenge, Bruce avoided the confrontation, possibly waryof what another expulsion would mean to him at this point in his life. As aresult Bruce was suddenly on the flipside of his own Hong Kong reputation, nolonger the challenging upstart but instead the wary senior.Glover knew of Yoiche’s [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt285] street-fighting reputation,and though it would get lost in the shuffle years later, the guy was known forsome tough fights around town. Yoiche had been formally trained in karate sincethe age of twelve while growing up in Japan (he was now twenty-nine), and had abackground in judo as well. According to Glover, Yoiche was fast, in good shape,and could attach power to his punches and kicks. Most recently Glover heard astory of how Yoiche had disarmed and defeated a knife-wielding opponent in aheated street brawl.The origin of their conflict [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt286] stemmed from one ofBruce’s recent demonstrations, in which he drew distinctions between kung fu andkarate that Yoiche had found offensive. Bruce often highlighted the softer sideof kung fu as a more nuanced approach to fighting and body mechanics. Incomparing this to the hard striking techniques found in karate, he drew Yoiche’sire. It would not be the last time that one of Bruce’s outspoken demonstrationscaused a fight.Standing in the yard [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt287] at the YMCA, Bruce waited,businesslike in street clothes, while accompanied by Glover and a few otherstudents. Yoiche surfaced ready to fight wearing a traditional karate gi, awhite uniform tied at the middle by a well-worn black belt. Bruce, by contrast,just took off his shirt and shoes. Mindful of consequences, Bruce had one pointto clarify with his challenger: “Let’s get this straight[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt288], you’re challenging me, right?”“Yes, I’m challenging you,” his opponent replied confidently.Bruce appeared content now. “That . . . is all I wanted to know.”Back in San Francisco T. Y. Wong’s students were scattered around the room sunkdeep into their individual horse stances, as they were inclined to do just priorto class. Like Lau Bun, T.Y. regarded horse-stance training as the cornerstoneof a fighter’s abilities, and his students would descend the steps before classand set themselves around the room like century-old statues.T.Y. was reading the newspaper at his desk with his reading glasses on as ayoung stranger came down the steps of Kin Mon.“Are you the teacher? [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt289]”“Yes, boy.” (In his broken English T.Y. called all his juniors “boy”). “I amprofessor.”“How would you block this?” the young man asked, slowly stretching a highroundhouse punch with his left fist.T.Y. glanced up, as did his students. These sort of upstart intrusions were rarebut not unheard of. Without letting go of his newspaper, T.Y. lifted his rightforearm up to the theoretical punch. “I block like this, boy.”Now with the right. “How would you block this?”T.Y. shifted up his left, seeming bemused, eyes on the newspaper. “Like this,boy, I block like this.”And then, in an instant, the walkup challenger threw it at him full speed. T.Y.countered quickly, catching the left-hand punch and throwing it across into hisopponent’s own right arm. Letting go T.Y. jabbed stabbing fingers within ahalf-inch of his challenger’s eyes, causing him to whip his head back inretreat.Kin Mon was quiet as T.Y. caught the loose ends of his newspaper and snapped itback up to reading level. His students still populated the room in their frozenhorse stances, slack-jawed as they watched the intruder hustled up the steps,happy to still have his now watering eyes.Silence.And then, nonchalantly from behind his newspaper, T.Y. remarked, “That boy knownothing.”There is a notion [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt290] that often surfaces around kungfu culture about the context of assessing fights: a true master can dispatch hisopponent quickly, in just three moves or less, essentially countering any attackand ending the contest in a brief instance of offense. From parables of elderwarriors to the ambitions of younger practitioners, that is the pinnacle ofvictory and the mark of a true master.In the courtyard [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt291] of the Seattle YMCA, Bruce set aclassic Wing Chun stance, ready to fight, his right palm extended forward andfacing skyward. Yoiche began high and then dipped into a crouch. They held stillfor a moment, before Bruce’s opponent launched the first attack.Yoiche shot a kick out at knee level, which Bruce quickly anticipated, battinghis foot away with his forearm and then—in the words of Glover and otherwitnesses—“drove his opponent [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt292]” across the yard witha furious barrage of straight punches to his face, until Yoiche bounced off thecourtyard’s rear wall and grasped wildly for traction. Bruce sidestepped him,and as his opponent fell to his knees, his white gi already red with blood,Bruce launched a final kick toward his head that caused Glover to yell out inpanic, as the impending knockout blow seemed far more like an execution-stylekill shot. The kick connected hard to Yoiche’s face, leaving the group ofspectators to stare at an unconscious heap.“The man took a long time [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt293] to regain consciousness,”Glover recounted. “I thought he was dead. The left side of his face looked likeit had been hit with a series of baseball bats. Later we found out his skull wascracked all around the eye socket.”Over time it would occasionally be referred to as the “eleven-second fight[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt294],” in which witnesses attest that in addition to theknockout kick, Bruce landed a multitude [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt295] of punchesin a mere eleven seconds. In the high ideal of effective victories, Bruce met achallenge by a formidable opponent and successfully applied his technique toobliterate him in a few short moves. There is scant variation on whattranspired.Bruce’s next fight would also be predicated on the contentious nature of one hisdemonstrations. That fight, however, would be much harder to assess. In fact,half a century later, martial artists would still be arguing about it, debatingwhat they heard from the rumor mill and urban mythology. That showdown was stilla few years in the making, during the first few months of Bruce’s move back tothe Bay Area. It would be a fight that would shape the lives of its participantsfor years to come. Yet it wouldn’t occur in San Francisco but rather eastward,where Bruce would find some of his closest colleagues, on the other side of theBay."},{"pageContent":"PART 2 [unp-russo-0007.xhtml#toc]OAKLAND"},{"pageContent":"7 [unp-russo-0007.xhtml#toc]THE INNOVATOROakland | 1962James Lee’s reputation was built on his physicality. His legacy, by contrast,would be based around his intellect.The brick breaking [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt296] didn’t help to clarify thisparadox. Steadying himself in the quiet solitude of his two-car garage, Jamesfocused on the short vertical stack of carpenter’s bricks that were arranged onthe table before him. A seasoned practitioner of Iron Palm technique, James haddeveloped a knack for pulverizing dense objects with his bare hands. It was animpressive sight, though one that probably failed to accurately convey the fullextent of his mental acumen.In an instant he struck down with his left hand, the impact rendering a soundthat was percussive and blunt, like the heavy thump of a well-swungsledgehammer. As the broken pieces fell away at their center, James stepped backto catch his breath. His upper body was rugged [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt297] andmuscular beneath a white tank top, with powerful arms that implied an imposingforce well beyond his mere five feet seven inches. At forty-two his physique notonly belied his age but gave testimony to the achievements[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt298] of his youth, as a bodybuilder, a gymnast, and astreet fighter.James arranged a new stack of bricks, feeling their friction as they pressedtogether atop one another. A welder by trade [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt299], hehad fashioned his own custom “breaking table” of appropriate height and width tohandle his Iron Palm practice, just as he had employed the skills of his day jobto invent other types of equipment to suit his training needs. These odd-lookingdevices populated his garage, such as the spring-loaded punching board, thechoke-hold training device, and his homemade incline bench. Collectively, theseinventions gave the workout space a peculiar air, hints of a mad scientist’slaboratory.James spent a lot of time down there in his garage training studio below hisfamily’s home on Monticello Avenue. After dinners with[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt300] his wife and two children, he’d descend the stepsto put in dedicated hours lifting weights and perfecting his fightingtechniques. In the process he had a lot of time to think, quiet moments when hegot his blood pumping and contemplated his latest plans for new contraptions,training strategies, and books to write.Though an unlikely candidate [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt301] to run his ownpublishing company, James began producing his own titles after realizing thatthere were scant few martial arts books available to enthusiasts. A few yearsback he had published his first work, Modern Kung Fu Karate: Iron, Poison HandTraining; Brick Break in 100 Days. He advertised it in the classified sectionsof national men’s magazines, such as Popular Mechanics and The Ring. In shortorder, packages [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt302] and envelopes began arriving fromall over the country (and the world) with payments for his book, solidifyingJames’s opinion that the obscurity of martial arts in America was poised to giveway to a substantial popularity.While considering a title [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt303] for his first book, Jameshad done something interesting. He found the term gung fu too unwieldy andhidebound for the Western mind. So he tweaked it by applying the Wade-Gilesstyle of pronunciation, effectively anglicizing it slightly to kung fu, whichresonated more like the term karate, a word that Americans interested in themartial arts were beginning to use with some familiarly. He could hardly haveknown it at the time, but James was playing a key role in bringing the term intothe English lexicon. It was one of the many places where he would quietly puthis mark on the foundations of martial arts in America.Born and raised in [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt304] the city of Oakland, James hadattended the city’s Technical High School, where he excelled in boxing andgymnastics. At the local YMCA he broke weight-lifting records for his age groupand then fell in with a local muscle crowd that pursued bodybuilding withdedicated zeal. Most notable [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt305] was the reputationJames had built for himself as a street fighter, known to be as fast as he wasfearless in using his fists. The rumors and urban legends of these brawls, whichstill persist, put his fight tally north of one hundred.After school he took [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt306] a welding apprenticeship inthe Pearl Harbor Shipyards in Hawaii. It began on December 1, 1941, a weekbefore the Japanese attack. Over the next few years he learned his trade in theurgent atmosphere of repairing the Pacific fleet. In his free time he studiedjudo and jujitsu in the islands’ thriving martial arts scene. He entered theservice toward the end of the war and contracted a case of malaria in thePhilippines so grave that the medical staff moved him into a tent housing thebodies of the recently deceased. The same grit that saw him through so many EastBay street fights somehow got him out of that tent as well.After returning to Oakland [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt307] following the war, Jamesstruck a balance between his hobby and his career, muddling their definitionseven as he found near equal time for the two. Between marriage and kids Jamescontinued his enthusiastic pursuits of martial arts, studying Sil Lum kung fuunder T. Y. Wong in Chinatown. As a star senior student, James eventuallyproposed [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt308] a book project to T.Y. Their resultingcollaboration, Chinese Karate Kung-Fu: Original “Sil Lum” System, for Health andSelf Defense, was among the very first books by a Chinese master in English. Theproject proved [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt309] both groundbreaking and dealbreaking, as James’s relationship with T.Y. quickly went sour after amisunderstanding over publishing costs. James abruptly stormed out of Kin Monand headed back to the East Bay resolved to start his own school.Talking with his close [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt310] friend and business partnerAl Novak after their split from T.Y., the two of them both seemed to know a lotof guys—cops, bouncers, construction workers—who would be interested in a lesstraditional martial arts curriculum. With this in mind James figured he woulddevise a more modern training environment—and would even call it as much: theEast Wind Modern Kung Fu Club—essentially applying a boxing-gym setting tomartial arts instruction. No months upon months of horse stances or forms. Theywould work out hard, they would spar, and his students would be able to handlethemselves in real-world encounters beyond his school. As James would explain[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt311] it, what his students would learn that day, theycould use that day. After trying to make a dilapidated space in Hayward work astheir headquarters, Novak and James retreated back to the two-car garage, wherethey seemed to be the most comfortable anyhow.Poising himself now for the new stack of bricks, James took a deep breath. Witha shift of weight, he snapped a backfist to the bricks. Again the bludgeon-likethud reverberated through the garage as the bricks fell apart.James soon returned upstairs. He had a fair amount of mail to open and orders tofulfill. He also had to put in a call to his friend Allen Joe. The two of them[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt312] had gone to high school together at Oakland Techand still remained close, sharing interests in both martial arts andbodybuilding. Allen was set to take his family to Seattle for the World’s Fair,and James wanted him to look up that Bruce Lee kid and scout him out. Again andagain people were mentioning the guy to James. First, his brother, Robert,[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt313] who took dance lessons with Bruce, and then GeorgeLee, who also caught him a few years back at the Chinese Citizen’s Alliance inOakland. Just recently, his friend [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt314] Wally Jay hadvisited Bruce in Seattle while traveling with his judo team and returned with aglowing impression. Wally was a nice guy, but he wouldn’t gloss up hisassessment of somebody’s martial prowess to James.If a more modern [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt315] approach was what he was seeking,James figured, then maybe this Bruce Lee guy had something to offer. He pickedup the phone and began to dial.Allen Joe ordered [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt316] a single malt Scotch and settledin by the bar at Ruby Chow’s. The hostess told him that Bruce was off for thenight, but was likely to resurface after 11:00 p.m.Allen had spent the day navigating his family through the colossal crowds of theScience Exhibition and Twenty-First Century Pavilion. The entire city of Seattlewas in the midst of world’s fair mania, which included long lines, traffic jams,and sold-out hotels. As luck would have it, the hotel Allen had secured for hisfamily was half a block from Ruby Chow’s restaurant, where Bruce worked as abusboy. This proved conducive for the scouting mission that James Lee had askedof him.Allen had grown up [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt317] with James attending OaklandTech in the late 1930s. Thinking back on those rambunctious days, Allenremembers gathering in a screaming mob—on numerous occasions, actually—to watchJames fistfight after school. The guy was a different kind of tough: not big,just powerful and wholly fearless. His fighting abilities were exhilarating towitness, though fairly unnerving, as well. Little wonder that they elected Jamesto be the student body president.James and Allen had [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt318] come of age at an interestingtime in Oakland, the two of them swept up in the tide of a burgeoningphysical-fitness scene unlike anything else in the country. In 1936 Jack LaLanneopened what is widely considered to be the first modern health club in America,on Fifteenth and Broadway in Oakland. A native of nearby Berkeley (the next townup), LaLanne had suffered acne and mood swings as a junk-food-obsessed teen.Exhausted by his eating habits and erratic behavior, LaLanne’s mother took himto a lecture by nutritionist Paul Bragg, who successfully inspired the teentoward a healthy diet and physically fit lifestyle.After the opening of Jack LaLanne’s Physical Culture Studio, criticism arosefrom the medical community, branding LaLanne a charlatan whose fitness programcould (by their assessment) result in such adverse physical side effects assterility, hemorrhoids, and heart attacks (and that women would suffer agrotesque “musclebound physique”). Later when he began a weekly fitness show onABC, LaLanne not only had to pay for his own airtime but was derided by criticswho gave the program a few weeks at best. Instead, it aired for thirty-fouryears, and LaLanne was proven a visionary, a fitness icon who changed theAmerican lifestyle.But for the East Bay [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt319] around the war years, LaLannewas hardly the lone fitness guru, merely the best know. The “friendlycompetition” that soon arose in the form of other local gyms produced many othernotable figures as a unique (and now, widely forgotten) Northern California“muscle beach” scene began to thrive.Although Allen would eventually become a close colleague with LaLanne (runningthe Fremont location of his fitness chain years later), his mentor during thistime was Ed Yarick, a six-foot-four, 250-pound longshoreman of Swedish descentwho ran a gym on Oakland’s Foothill Boulevard for rugged characters interestedin serious bodybuilding. Yarick would produce four Mr. America winners out ofhis space in Oakland—Steve Reeves (later famous for his silver screen role asHercules), Jack Delinger, Clancy Ross, and Roy Hiligan—not to mention OlympicGold medalist Tommy Kono.Outside the gym, they took to the surf and sand, becoming regular fixtures atlocal swim spots like Sunny Cove and Neptune Beach, where they would pass thetime showing off their physiques with gymnastics and other feats of strength(multiple-person vertical balancing acts were the most popular). Allen’s Asianheritage never mattered within Oakland’s muscle culture. Still outsidersthemselves, they welcomed him in his late teens when he was a scrawny kid stillshy of one hundred pounds. Later, after his service [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt320]in World War II, Allen returned to the scene with gusto, winning Mr. NorthernCalifornia in 1946 within his height division, the first Asian to do so.Working on a second Scotch [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt321] there in Seattle, Allenlooked up to see the hostess pointing a young, well-dressed, and bespectacledChinese man in his direction. That . . . is Bruce Lee? Allen thought to himself,sizing up the guy’s neatly pressed gray flannel suit, the kid looks like afashion model.Allen introduced himself as Bruce came over to his side of the bar. He sensedthat Bruce was suspicious of who was asking for him and quickly tried to put himat ease.“I was told about you [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt322] from Robert and Harriet Lee,they took dance lessons from you in Oakland,” Allen explained. “They said youare pretty good at Gung Fu.”Bruce’s face lit up [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt323] with excitement. Apparentlythose were the magic words.“You practice Gung Fu? [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt324]” Bruce asked with surprise.“Yes, with Robert’s brother [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt325] James,” Allenexplained.And with that . . . Bruce had made a new friend. “Come on, let’s[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt326] get a bite to eat.”The two of them made [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt327] their way down the block to ahamburger joint, with Bruce talking excitedly about his life in Seattle. Bruceexplained how after completing his high school education at Edison Tech, he hadthen transferred to the University of Washington, where he was now studyingphilosophy. He explained the informal martial arts classes he held around townand his plans for opening his own martial arts school, possibly by the end ofthe year. Bruce also recounted his meeting with Wally Jay, expressing admirationfor the jujitsu master.From there Allen clued Bruce into their scene in Oakland, explaining that JamesLee was a serious practitioner who ran his own school, built his own equipment,and even published his own martial arts books. In the meager martial artslandscape in America, these credentials were impressive to Bruce, and the two ofthem began hashing out the possibilities of a meeting.Walking up to the burger place, Bruce stopped Allen on the sidewalk.“Before we go in [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt328],” Bruce told him, “I want you totry to hit me as hard as you can.”A mile east across San Francisco Bay, happily withdrawn from the Pacific fog,the city of Oakland takes up the opposite shore with low-key moxie. Historicallybuilt and populated around opportunities of industry, Oakland—like Chicago orSeattle—is entirely unapologetic in its core identity as a working-class city,particularly as its peacock of an older sister across the Bay aspires to beAmerica’s self-styled version of Paris. There’s a tidy balance to this, to thetwo cities teetering on fault lines along either side of the Bay: Oakland andSan Francisco; small to large, humble and glamorous, east and west.Driving his black Ford [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt329] Fairlane “police car” southalong 580, Bruce was in the final stretch of the twelve-hour drive from Seattle.Although born in the heart of San Francisco, Bruce Lee was poised to discoverhis kindred spirits in the city of Oakland.Allen Joe had returned [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt330] from his family vacation inthe Pacific Northwest and reported his assessment of Bruce to James Lee. He keptit short and simple: “James, the kid is amazing [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt331].”Bruce and Allen had stayed [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt332] up late into the nightback in Seattle, exchanging techniques and talking fitness and philosophy. Backin the Bay Area Allen had successfully connected Bruce and James, who talked viaphone. James invited Bruce to stay at his house in Oakland the next time he wasdown to visit. Now, with San Francisco Bay on his right, Bruce drove south asthe East Bay hills rose on his left.Two hundred years [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt333] earlier those hills had beenoccupied by towering old-growth coastal redwoods. The tallest species of tree onplanet Earth, the redwoods populating the eastern hills of the Bay were so largethey were used as navigation markers by Spanish explorers during their Pacificexcursions from Mexico in the eighteenth century. By the pre–gold rush days,just as the settlement of Yerba Buena was transitioning to becoming the city ofSan Francisco, those same redwoods would begin falling at the hands ofsquatters, deserters, and frontier opportunists who rowed across the water topounce on the local market for lumber.As San Francisco blossomed [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt334] overnight in the wake ofthe gold rush, the price of lumber surged with it. Many workers who hadinitially deserted the lumber camps for the gold fields soon returned, realizingthat a more dependable fortune could be made closer to the Bay. Logging campsevolved into sawmills, and by 1860 the redwoods that had lined the hills werecut clean; only the massive stumps of the old growths provided any proof oftheir existence. As the trees had rapidly fallen, the city of Oakland slowlyrose.Oblivious to the ghosts of ancient trees, Bruce continued south, anxious[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt335] to reach his destination after so many hours behindthe wheel. In the near distance, beyond the Bay Bridge, the Oakland shipyardsbroadcast an industrial identity. Oakland had grown with San Francisco over theyears, maturing in an age of steel and transportation. In 1868 Oakland[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt336] was chosen to be the western terminus of thetranscontinental railroad, a key designation as the nation continued to reviseits spatial boundaries. (At the time there was [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt337] talkof incorporating Oakland into San Francisco as one large and unified Bay Areaentity, yet the water between them ultimately enforced a permanent separation.)With the turn [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt338] of the century, the city’s populationdoubled in size as refugees from the 1906 earthquake departed the San Franciscopeninsula. As Oakland historian Beth Bagwell explains: “There were those whothought [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt339] San Francisco was finished, that Oaklandwould become the main Bay Area city. . . . San Francisco, of course, survived.Before a month passed, there were jubilant plans for resurrection. But noteveryone wanted to go back. Whatever their reasons, tens of thousands decided tostay in Oakland. Businesses came, too; their temporary emergency quarters inOakland became permanent. The U.S. Census figures tell the story. Oakland’spopulation grew from 67,000 in 1900 to 150,000 in 1910.”With the opening [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt340] of the Panama Canal in 1915, theport of Oakland thrived, becoming a major West Coast hub for heavy shipping andshipbuilding. Aeronautics soon followed [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt341], and theOakland Municipal Airport was constructed to feature the largest runway in theworld. (Amelia Earhart operated [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt342] numerousexpeditions in and out of Oakland and held an office downtown at the LeamingtonHotel.) By the 1920s the city [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt343] was being dubbed the“Detroit of the West” as the automotive sector established satellite plants inOakland. The industry and job [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt344] opportunities broughtby World War II brought a new gold rush to California, with Oakland benefitingthe most. The shipyards thrived in this era (at times, running twenty-four hoursa day), and many Americans migrated to Oakland for the work. The sum total ofthis industrial arc not only distinguished Oakland from San Francisco but alsoimpressed upon the city some long-term and very distinguishing features in theform of a highly diverse and multiracial population, as well as a middle-classblue-collar identity.For Bruce the view [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt345] from the eastern shores of theBay out toward the skyline of San Francisco inevitably stoked memories of hischildhood in Kowloon, looking out toward Hong Kong Island. It was a subtle andnearly subconscious affiliation, but one more reason for his comfort in the cityof Oakland.If James Lee was searching [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt346] for a modern take on theChinese martial arts, it was now standing on his doorstep with a nervous smile.Bruce stood there a full two decades younger than James, a college studentsettling into adulthood greeting a family man years into a nine-to-five career.Even still, it was a fateful meeting and the beginning of a fraternalrelationship that would mark the remainder of both of their lives.For Bruce the trip down to the Bay Area was not entirely just martial artswhimsy. Juggling a variety [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt347] of employment—RubyChow’s, his own fledgling martial arts school (still without a physicallocation), and a monotonous gig stuffing inserts into the Seattle Times—Brucealso had standing work offers in the Bay Area to teach dance lessons, includinga fairly lucrative one that had developed with the renowned Arthur Murray DanceCompany. He was planning a trip [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt348] back to Hong Kongin the coming year (his first return since he had left on that ocean liner inthe spring of 1959), and he intended to return home with gifts for his parentsand money for his siblings, a Chinese tradition that would assert his maturationand independent success. In this sense the rich kid who grew up attended to byfamily servants and couldn’t hold the restaurant job his godfather had gottenhim years earlier had developed an admirable work ethic in his early adulthood.All that aside, Bruce [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt349] was anxious to meet JamesLee. Allen Joe had painted Bruce a vivid picture of their Oakland martial artsscene, with stories of bodybuilding, book publishing, and one-of-a-kind trainingequipment. Collectively, it resonated as the sort of martial arts future thatBruce himself had already been envisioning.On Monticello Avenue [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt350] he was greeted with warmth andenthusiasm, and it wasn’t long after meeting James’s wife and children over teain the living room that Bruce was standing in the garage in front of thespring-loading punching board with mischievous intention. “So,” he asked withboyish zeal, “how does this thing work? [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt351]”As the entire house [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt352] began to reverberate from thedrum-like bursts of Bruce and James assaulting the various contraptions in thegarage, not only was a long-term friendship taking shape but a new and formativechapter in Bruce’s life as well.James Lee and his colleagues [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt353] in the Bay Arearepresented a fresh opportunity for him. Already critical of the traditionalmasters, yet anxious to learn from experienced practitioners, Bruce discoveredthe next logical step in his martial arts evolution.Having spent his teen years within Hong Kong’s rooftop fighting culture whilealso studying under Ip Man, Bruce then honed his skills by practicing againstthe raw toughness of Seattle street fighters. The colleagues Bruce was nowdiscovering in Oakland via James Lee represented an entirely new dynamic. Inaddition to being older and formally accomplished, the East Bay camp embodiedthe kind of modern martial arts mindset that Bruce was seeking.“Bruce was smart [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt354],” says James Lee’s son Greglon.“When he’s in his twenties he’s hanging out with guys in their forties, so hecan gain their experience.”Yet they would regard Bruce not as a student but as an equal and a colleague.Collectively, they would immerse themselves in an exchange of ideas that lookedmore to the future of martial arts, than to its past.The following morning James Lee put in a call to his friend Allen Joe, anxiousto report back to him on his time with Bruce. James kept his assessment shortand simple: “Allen, the kid is amazing [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt355].”"},{"pageContent":"8 [unp-russo-0007.xhtml#toc]THE HAWAIIAN CONNECTION (PART ONE)Alameda, California | 1963It was getting late [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt356] on Eagle Avenue, but theconversation only grew more animated with the hour. Wally Jay was hosting alively bunch, and the domestic setting of his living room was at timeschallenged to contain the company.Bruce Lee jumped [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt357] off his chair eager to exhibitsome Northern Shaolin technique, shortly after James Lee had held the floorreexamining the perils of a past street fight. Al Novak was also in attendance,his size and energy akin to a grizzly bear politely attending a cocktail party.Bruce was down from Seattle [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt358] again. His trips to theBay Area had become more frequent as his friendship with James Lee grew and thetwo of them began to collaborate on a new book project together. They arrived atthe Jay household with Novak earlier in the evening, and after dinner theconversation zigzagged in many directions, though always keeping a wide-netapproach to the topic of martial arts. The talk came packaged[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt359] with demonstrations, which not only gave the room ahands-on think-tank type of atmosphere but increasingly resulted in thefurniture getting pushed further and further to the corners of the house(despite the polite suggestions of Wally’s wife, Bernice, urging them to “alljust go out back [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt360]”).On the topic of kung fu [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt361] styles, the group observedhow the Bay Area only showcased southern Chinese fighting systems: Lau Bun withChoy Li Fut and T. Y. Wong with his brand of Sil Lum Fut Gar (like many others,they were unaware that Master Choy was extensively skilled in Southern Mantis).James remarked how there had also been a Hung Gar teacher in Chinatown namedChan Heung, who taught that particular southern style at a small school on RossAlley, but he had passed recently.On his feet now [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt362] Bruce offered to give everyone aglimpse of northern China. He related how during his late teens in Hong Kong hehad traded cha-cha lessons for instruction with a Northern Shaolin master, aworthwhile arrangement, since Bruce picked up the fighting style much fasterthan his counterpart could improve at dancing. (Bruce’s buddy Hawkins[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt363] Cheung had come with him for lessons, but themaster’s dog barked at him incessantly, wearing Hawkins out after just a coupleof sessions.) Bruce explained how [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt364] the acrobaticnature of the Northern Shaolin style provided some visual flash for his kung fudemonstrations, particularly when performing for the uninitiated.Whereas Bruce’s Wing Chun was short and direct, with explosive bursts ofpunches, he demonstrated how Northern Shaolin style was more expansive innature, with particular emphasis on far-reaching kicks. In this regard it waspoorly suited for a nicely furnished living room. Bruce snapped the kicks highand wide, as if he were trying to dislodge the overhead light fixtures. In timeBruce would exhibit [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt365] Northern Shaolin technique notfor its flare but rather as a launching point into his criticisms of overlyextravagant fighting styles.The conversations continued on [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt366] to many othertopics, everything from Novak’s combat experience to the closing techniques offencing practitioners. On the subject of American [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt367]boxing, Bruce expressed a great admiration for Jack Dempsey and Sugar RayRobinson. “Dempsey was out for the kill [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt368],” Brucedeclared. “He was a stalking tiger.” This reference led to an analysis of boxingfootwork—much to Bruce’s considerable interest—which now spurred Wally forward[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt369] to demonstrate. Prior to his jujitsu training[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt370] in Hawaii, Wally had also spent his teen yearstraining as a boxer, first in high school and then later in college.Inevitably then, the topic steered to the kid [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt371]Cassius Clay, and everyone seemed to have a take on the upcoming title fightbetween him and Sonny Liston. As egotistical as he was dynamic, with a stunningpenchant for trash talking, Clay was a polarizing figure who elicited strongopinions. Unsurprisingly perhaps, Bruce expressed a real affinity for the youngchallenger.All debate and differences over Cassius Clay aside, Bruce held the presentcompany [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt372] on Eagle Avenue in very high regard,respectful of both their real-world fighting capabilities and theirforward-thinking approach to the martial arts. Novak would have fit[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt373] in well up in Seattle, with the likes of JesseGlover and James Demile, who shared his sense of street-fighter grit andinstinct. If Novak’s size and abilities weren’t impressive enough, the storiesof his background were like something out of a military adventure novel. Havingbeen stationed in Pearl Harbor during the Japanese attack, Novak soon trainedalongside a young John F. Kennedy on the swift boats and was deployed to theAtlantic (Kennedy went to the Pacific), where he helped invade Normandy onD-Day. Later, he was in the Pacific theater when the atomic bombs were droppedon Japan at the end of the war.Bruce was also becoming [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt374] close with Wally Jay andmade a point of visiting him with each trip to the Bay Area. Bruce relished thefact that Wally was a Chinese practitioner who not only had mastered a Japanesemartial art but was beating Japanese fighters at it in competitions on a regularbasis.More notably though, Bruce felt that he had found another like-minded peer(similar to James Lee) in the way that Wally was always reevaluating his art,constantly pushing for it to evolve beyond its current incarnation. In fact,when Wally’s [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt375] son returned home from college, thefamily’s jujitsu system had evolved so much that it appeared foreign to him.As Bruce was becoming [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt376] an increasingly vocal criticof what he saw as the static and ineffective nature of traditional martial arts,these Oakland practitioners appealed to him as the antidote: tangible examplesof how innovative and modern approaches could be effectively applied asreal-world fighting principles. Conversely, they saw something special in Bruce,not merely in the sense of a talented colleague, but something far greater, asort of profound potential that might just render a one-in-a-billion trajectory.Often over the course [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt377] of the evening, theconversation would shift back to Hawaii. It was where Wally was born and raised,and where James and Novak had spent time in their twenties. The three of themhad all studied martial arts there. And just as the names of Lau Bun and T. Y.Wong constantly surfaced around the topic of San Francisco’s Chinatown, therewere certain figures who came up whenever Bruce’s colleagues spoke about themartial arts culture in Hawaii, names like Mitose, Okazaki, Emperado, Chow.These practitioners, and the stories that surrounded them, impressed upon Brucethe sizable but little-known role of Hawaii as a unique martial arts provingground.In 1922 British heavyweight [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt378] boxer Carl “KO” Morrisarrived in the Hawaiian Islands and extended an open invitation to Asian martialartists to test their mettle against him in the ring. Morris had a reputationfor being openly condescending toward the Asian fighting arts, and his challengewas quickly considered a standing insult to the islands’ large Japaneseimmigrant community.Starting in the mid-nineteenth [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt379] century, the vastemployment opportunities offered by the Hawaiian sugar plantations drew largewaves of Asian immigrants, even though the work itself was particularly harshand the labor contracts that organized it all amounted to indentured servitude.The Chinese came first, during the 1850s, and similar to those who flocked tothe San Francisco gold rush, they mainly arrived from Guangdong Province insouthern China. The American exclusion laws at the end of the century curbedChinese migration to the islands (just as it had done on the main land), thusbeginning a similar process with the Japanese.In the social turbulence [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt380] of modernization in Japanduring the late 1800s, many of its citizens ventured further out into thePacific to seek employment in the Hawaiian cane fields. In fact, by the early1920s the Japanese would compose [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt381] some 40 percent ofHawaii’s population, just before a new federal [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt382] actin 1924 significantly restricted immigration into the United States. Signed intolaw by President Coolidge with little congressional opposition, the ImmigrationAct of 1924 (also known as the Johnson-Reed Act) was a heavy-handed andfar-reaching piece of legislation that severely reduced immigration into theUnited States for the next four decades, in an effort to “preserve the ideal[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt383] of American homogeneity.”Filipinos, who were exempt from [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt384] the newrestrictions as citizens of a U.S. colony, rounded out the last major wave ofAsian immigrants into Hawaii, coming on the heels of the earlier Japaneseinflux. All these migrant groups [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt385] maintained strongties to their native lands, bringing their customs, cuisine, and martial artswith them.“Hawaii was the first great [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt386] melting pot of Asianmartial arts,” explains Dan Inosanto, an eclectic martial arts master who wouldbecome one of Bruce Lee’s closest friends. “It’s where Chinese trained Japanese,Japanese trained Chinese, Chinese trained Philipino, and then Hawaiiansthemselves got involved in all those arts, too.”By the time that Morris [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt387] made his dismissivechallenge in 1922, Hawaii already had a diverse and thriving martial artsculture unlike anywhere else in the world.In seeking out a practitioner [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt388] to represent theirnation in the ring, the Japanese community in Hawaii appealed to a local martialartist who fully embodied the multifaceted nature of the local fight culture. Atthirty-two Seishiro Okazaki was the fourth son in a long family line of samurai,the military aristocracy of Japan for many centuries. Okazaki was born, however,after the sun had set on the samurai class. During the late nineteenth century[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt389], the emperor of Japan abolished the long-held castesystem in an effort toward modernization, which (among other things) resulted inthe disenfranchisement of the samurai. They were stripped of their socialentitlements and could no longer carry swords. Okazaki’s father was one of manysamurai who were unsuccessful at making the transition to more domesticatedbusiness pursuits.During family financial turmoil [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt390], Okazaki set outfor the Hawaiian sugar cane fields in his late teens. He suffered severe healthproblems (and related depression) at the age of nineteen and found his way tojujitsu through a Japanese doctor who advised it as a way to invigorate hisphysical well-being. This proved to be a successful approach, returning Okazakito health and inspiring him toward a lifelong pursuit of both martial arts andhealing practices.Living in the Hilo [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt391] region of the big island,Okazaki spent the next twelve years of his life practicing not just jujitsu (ofwhich he mastered three different styles) but any martial arts that he couldseek out on the islands: kung fu with a seventy-eight-year-old Chinese master inKohala, karate from an Okinawan, Filipino knife fighting, Western wrestling, andthe native Hawaiian martial art of lua. He also spent considerable time studyingrestorative medicine and massage.If there was a fighter [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt392] who could beat the Englishboxer, the Japanese community reasoned, surely it was Okazaki. Upon hearingtheir request, however, he quickly turned them down. When a Japanese black beltnamed Takahashi finally did step into the ring against Morris, the Britishpugilist made quick work of him with a first-round knockout. Again, the Japanesecommunity appealed to Okazaki. After all, it was now, more than ever, a matterof national pride. This time he relented.The fighting method [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt393] of jujitsu is believed to haveemerged from samurai combat techniques around the sixteenth century in feudalJapan. Translated to mean “the art of gaining victory[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt394] by pliancy,” the term jujitsu was eventuallyemployed to describe [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt395] a wide range of grapplingtechniques, in which the practitioner uses throws, chokes, and locks to gainadvantage over an opponent. These methods, with their[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt396] grappling-style emphasis, were originally devisedfor use against heavily armed and armored opponents on the battlefield, in whichopen-hand strikes would be ineffective. Over time, particularly during longbouts of peace in Japan, jujitsu evolved into a more focused unarmed fightingsystem.Later, in an effort [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt397] to create an avenue ofcompetition and sparring that didn’t leave participants with broken bones andother serious injuries, the art of judo was developed in the late nineteenthcentury by Jigoro Kano as a competitive sport, and really a less lethal form ofjujitsu (as one of Wally Jay’s students explains it, “they took all the nastybits out [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt398]”).Whereas the Chinese martial [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt399] arts remainedremarkably insular, judo had spread well beyond Japan by the beginning of thetwentieth century, so much so that President [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt400]Theodore Roosevelt took lessons from a Japanese judo instructor for a time atthe White House. (Roosevelt, in his more overzealous moments, would oftendemonstrate judo techniques on young men visiting the Oval Office.) More so thaneven the Okinawan art of karate (which remained obscure prior to World War II),judo was really the first Asian martial art to cross borders in the West.In preparing for the Morris [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt401] fight, Okazaki wassaddled with the challenge of how to successfully apply his jujitsu training andwider martial arts knowledge to defeat a formidable Western boxer. He spent theweeks leading up to the fight analyzing boxing technique in an attempt to findan approach that would fare better than that of his vanquished predecessorTakahashi. As a result Okazaki developed an especially low fighting crouch, withthe reasoning that boxers had little practice punching downward.On May 19, 1922 [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt402], Okazaki met Morris in the ring fora wild bout. Okazaki quickly had his nose broken in the first round but managedto throw Morris out of the ring twice. Seeing the boxer hang his jab too long,Okazaki drove under his arm and threw him to the mat in a move that appeared tobreak Morris’s arm on the spot, much to the manic delight of the Japanesespectators in attendance. Humble in his victory, Okazaki visited Morris in thehospital and treated his arm (which wasn’t broken but badly injured) with hisown method of massage. Later Morris would study jujitsu in Okazaki’s classduring the remainder of his stay in Hawaii.In 1926 Okazaki returned [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt403] to Japan, and used histime to seek out more martial artists. He traveled to numerous schools aroundthe country, adding a variety of different techniques to his repertoire. When hereturned to Hawaii, he developed his own particular system of jujitsu, aneclectic approach that incorporated elements of kung fu, karate, and many of theother styles he had been exposed to over the years. He called his particularbrand of jujitsu Danzan Ryu, which translates as “Cedar Mountain Style,” areference to the Chinese term for the Hawaiian Islands (as well as anacknowledgment to honor his Chinese kung fu teacher).Photos of his students [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt404] in the years prior to WorldWar II depict classes with very large enrollment, including what would add up tothousands of American servicemen taught over the years at the Honolulu YMCA.Although the local [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt405] Japanese community had embracedhim for the Morris fight—awarding him a gold watch for his victory—they hadlong-running tensions with Okazaki over his willingness to teach Japanesemartial arts to Caucasians (much in the style of the old Chinese tong codesurrounding kung fu). Through many confrontations Okazaki always maintained[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt406] that if Hawaii was a part of America, then he wouldcontinue to freely teach Americans.With the Japanese attack [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt407] on Pearl Harbor on themorning of December 7, 1941, Okazaki grabbed his family’s samurai sword andraced into the streets ready to fight a land invasion that never came. In theaftermath Okazaki was put into an internment camp by American authorities. Hespent three months at the facility in Ewa, before local police, politicians, andjournalists successfully advocated for his release.Born to Chinese immigrants [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt408] on the Hawaiian Islands,Wally Jay started his martial arts training with boxing, before he beganstudying jujitsu at Okazaki’s school in the late 1930s. He trained under seniorinstructor Juan Gomez and worked his way up to a black belt in 1944. In theyears that followed, Wally became close with Okazaki, learning his healingmethods and helping him in personal affairs.Intent on furthering his skills, Wally also studied judo for a time with KenKawachi. As the Hawaiian judo champion for many years, Kawachi was a physicallysmall man who often dominated opponents twice his size. Wally marveled at this,and eventually his studies with Kawachi would become a core component of hismartial arts approach.In 1950 Wally [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt409] moved his family to the Bay Area,where he soon built a small gym behind his home in Alameda and formed the IslandJudo Jujitsu Club, which would host thousands of students over the course of thenext six decades. However, Wally’s evolution [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt410] as amartial artist was heavily influenced by an early failure, when during a heftyloss at a competition in San Francisco, his coaching abilities and his team’sskills were publicly ridiculed by Mits Kimura, the highest ranking judopractitioner in America at the time.The disparaging remarks weighed heavily on Wally and sparked a period ofintrospection and reevaluation. Thinking back to Ken Kawachi’s ability todominate, Wally reexamined what he had learned during his time with Kawachi andsoon developed the Small Circle Theory. He integrated Kawachi’s emphasis onsuperior leverage through a nuanced approach to commanding wrist action. ForWally and his students, this would be the key to their future success.“When we first came [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt411] out here to the U.S., we gotwiped out,” explains Wally’s son Alan. “But the generations after me became muchbetter. As my dad improved, the entire team improved. Soon he had nationalchampions on his squad.”Wally became a popular [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt412] and well-known figure aroundthe United States, as a result of driving his judo team (on funds generated fromhis twice-a-year luau parties) around the country to compete. His openness andpositive disposition made him into a sort of early ambassador of the fledglingmartial arts culture in America. However, in the years after Okazaki’s passing,Wally would field criticism [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt413] from quarters of DanzanRyu for deviating too far from their professor’s model. Knowing that Okazaki wasat heart a modernist and an innovator, Wally stood firm in maintaining that hisprofessor would have encouraged him to continue evolving. This theme—of seekinginnovation over static interpretation—would be a key feature of Wally Jay’scareer and a point of connection with Bruce Lee’s own evolution.“There was a kind of [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt414] two-way admiration betweenthem,” says Dan Inosanto. “Wally had a very high respect for Bruce Lee, and likemost people, Bruce admired Wally Jay. In time, Bruce adapted a lot tactics thatcame from Professor Jay.”Yet Wally Jay was not the only influence out of Hawaii that would shape BruceLee’s career in the days to come."},{"pageContent":"9 [unp-russo-0007.xhtml#toc]THE HAWAIIAN CONNECTION (PART TWO)San Francisco | 1963Bruce shifted his weight with a bounce, poised to advance, “Are you ready?[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt415]”“Ready when you are Bruce.”Ralph Castro steadied himself [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt416] for Bruce’s strike,while James Lee and Ed Parker looked on, half amused and half curious. The fourof them stood inside Castro’s martial arts school on Valencia Street in SanFrancisco’s Mission District, and much like the late night think-tank sessionsat Wally Jay’s home on Eagle Avenue, they were deep into discussing anddemonstrating a wide range of martial arts matters. At the moment Bruce wasready to show off the speed of his lead-hand backfist, charging Castro with thetask of blocking it.Parker and Castro had [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt417] just been introduced to Bruceearlier that evening. He was staying at James Lee’s house while down fromSeattle. Parker was staying with Castro while up from Los Angeles. As he oftendid with other martial artists in his circle, James arranged for everyone tomeet. After dinner in Oakland, the group all put on [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt418]long beige trench coats (at the moment they collectively looked like a bunch ofFBI agents) and braved the inclement weather to travel over the Bay Bridge tovisit Castro’s school on Valencia.As the conversation surged forward about styles, technique, and fightingmechanics, Parker began to warm [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt419] up to Bruce. Atfirst the kid was coming across as too cocksure for his liking, but the morethey talked, and the more he demonstrated, the more Parker could see that Brucecould back up his attitude. Castro was also impressed with the kid, though atthe moment he was confident he could block the impending backfist.Parker and Castro were both [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt420] natives of Hawaii. Thetwo had known each other for a decade now, having spent Coast Guard trainingtogether at the nearby Alameda naval base. Later, on a trip back to the islands,Castro learned that Parker had studied kenpo under the same teacher as he had.These days they were close colleagues, operating their kenpo schools in atight-knit orbit.Castro had a tough [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt421] reputation dating back to hishigh school days in Hawaii. In California his students[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt422] were an intimidating presence at tournaments andmartial arts gatherings. As a Bay Area [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt423] resident,Castro would soon become a regular at those late-night martial arts sessions,exchanging ideas and techniques into the early hours of the morning with Bruce,James Lee, Al Novak, Wally Jay, and Allen Joe.Parker too would fit right into the mix whenever he was in town from SouthernCalifornia, and in time he would play a much larger role in the long-termtrajectory of Bruce’s career.Bruce was ready now [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt424] with his move and in an instantstood still in disbelief. Castro had blocked his backfist clean. Again, theHawaiians were surfacing on Bruce’s radar.The word kenpo translates as “fist law [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt425],” or rather“the method of the fist.” It is a broad [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt426] term—like“martial arts” or “self-defense”—that carries a complex and colorful history: itcan be described as a Japanese word for a Chinese concept that was heavilyinfluenced by the Okinawans, and uniquely interpreted by the Hawaiians. Betteryet, kenpo would also be integral to the rise of martial arts culture inAmerica.Kenpo’s origins in Hawaii [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt427] are often linked to JamesMitose, a highly polarizing figure who is still controversial for many martialartists decades after his passing, having spent the last seven years of his lifein Folsom Prison serving a sentence for murder and extortion (charges he deniedto his death). Born in Hawaii, Mitose [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt428] was relocatedas a child to live with his mother’s family in Japan, where he learned hisfamily’s art of kenpo, which contained techniques that bore similarities tojujitsu and Okinawan karate. He returned to Hawaii in 1935 while still in hisearly twenties and soon began teaching his family’s style around Honolulu.Parker and Castro learned kenpo [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt429] in Hawaii yearslater from William Chow, a small, gruff man of pure muscle who at five feet twowent by the nickname “Thunderbolt.” He was known to be[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt430] a volatile character who was rumored to have oftentangled with U.S. servicemen around Honolulu. Chow worked with Mitose for a time(whether as a student or a colleague is a matter of debate) before running hisown school, where he taught a style that was more heavily influenced by hisChinese heritage, conducting classes that were notorious for their starkphysicality. In reflecting on Chow’s teaching style, one student recalled, “Hewas into full-on [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt431] fighting in the classroom ratherthan sparring. I used to get broken ribs. It was bad. That’s how we learned it.”Born into the Mormon [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt432] faith, Parker was raised inthe multiethnic working-class Kahili district of Honolulu, a rough immigrantneighborhood that boasted its fair share of street violence. In his late teenshe studied under Chow for a relatively short period of time before attendingcollege at Brigham Young University in the mid-1950s.Accustomed to the thriving martial arts environment he had grown up around inHawaii, Parker arrived on the mainland [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt433] to realizethat there were only a scant few martial arts schools in America. During thehalftime [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt434] of a Brigham Young–UCLA basketball game in1955, Parker gave a kenpo demonstration and was subsequently met with a hugewave of interest from both students and local law enforcement.He corresponded with Professor [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt435] Chow and gainedpermission to open a school on the mainland. Relocating to Pasadena Californiain 1956, Parker soon opened his first location and quickly began attractinginterest from the Hollywood crowd. Elvis Presley watched one of Parker’sdemonstrations at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in 1960, and the two became closefriends and colleagues until Presley’s death years later. By 1961 Parker hadbeen profiled in Time magazine as the “High Priest of Hollywood’s[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt436] Karate Sect.” Two years later Parker appeared in anepisode of The Lucy Show in which he taught judo to Lucille Ball. Over time hiscelebrity [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt437] students would include the likes ofWarren Beatty, Gary Cooper, and Blake Edwards (who cast Parker in two of hisPink Panther films).Without many years [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt438] of extensive trainingexperience, Parker proved tireless in researching and interpreting a wide rangeof styles, developing his own modified system, and terming it American KenpoKarate. By the time of his meeting with Bruce Lee, while the Asian martial artswere still scarcely known in America, Parker was really just getting started. Healready had a small [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt439] network of schools in place onthe West Coast and possessed a much greater vision for numerous locations aroundthe entire country. More notable still was an event that Parker was planning[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt440] in the coming year, which would draw anunprecedented gathering of martial artists together, and become a cornerstone ofmartial arts culture in America."},{"pageContent":"10 [unp-russo-0007.xhtml#toc]WAY OF THE INTEGRATED FISTOakland | 1963Leo Fong worked the heavy bag in James Lee’s garage on a Friday night, stilltrying to chase down the “the ultimate [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt441].” Or atleast, that’s how he liked to phrase it. Even with his extensive background inAmerican boxing, Fong had spent [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt442] the past few yearsmaking the drive to study at martial arts schools around the San Francisco Bay,looking to expand his repertoire and cobble together some kind of uniquelysublime fighting style.He studied at Hung Sing with Lau Bun, with T. Y. Wong down in Kin Mon, and nowwith Jimmy Lee in his garage on Monticello Avenue in North Oakland. Like a smallbut ever-increasing number of young American men in those days, Fong wascompelled by the allure of Asian martial arts, surmising that there were somesuperior fighting secrets to be unearthed. As a result he was contemplating a“radical overhaul [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt443]” of his martial arts focus,despite his success as a boxer. So in addition to his Bay Area training, Fonghad even clocked time studying tae kwon do and jujitsu in recent years, as well.Fong practiced his main [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt444] boxing combo to keep it intune: drop down for a fake to the body with the right, then lights out up highwith a left hook to the jaw. Jimmy’s garage now echoed with a sharp“pah-pah . . . pah-pah [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt445],” as Fong delivered thetechnique repeatedly to the bag. He had racked up [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt446]eighteen knockouts with that particular move in his college days, and he couldstill throw it with devastating effectiveness.Currently assigned to a church in Vallejo, Fong’s parish duties as a Methodistminister left him with little free time, making Friday nights one of the fewparts of his week that he could dedicate to martial arts. These odd hours[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt447] rendered him an outsider to the typical classstructure, leaving him to work out in quiet, scarcely populated sessions whilethe main class members and senior students were busy with extracurricularweekend pursuits. This suited Fong just fine, who had spent the majority of hislife as an outlier to the groups around him.So with little company beyond the unique contraptions that populated Jimmy’sgarage, Fong worked the heavy bag. Pah-pah . . . pah-pah. Another Friday nightchasing the ultimate. It was the same story throughout Fong’s entire life:always in the ring but forever outside the box.At the age of fifteen [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt448], Leo Fong’s first “smoker”fight was against the high school’s varsity quarterback, a kid named Dave Hodge.As soon as he had been approached with the opportunity to fight, Fong knew thathe was clearly outweighed in the match-up (118 pounds to Hodge’s 175), but theguys setting up the fights minimized the concern and scheduled him anyhow. Inboxing terminology Fong was being set up as a “tomato can,” a fighter who isbeing put in the ring just to fill out the card and lose to a superior opponent.The match was held [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt449] in an abandoned schoolhouse inthe town of Widener, Arkansas. About fifty local men were in attendance,drinking and smoking (hence the “smoker” slang), and betting twenty-five cents afight. The ring was merely a loosely hung rope along three sides. The fourthside was the schoolhouse wall.When the bell (or whatever makeshift apparatus) had rung, Fong aggressivelyraced over to attack Hodge and was met with a few stiff jabs before getting hishead bounced off that schoolhouse wall. The fight lasted a few more lopsidedrounds before the organizers realized they were obligated to intervene. Fongwalked home depressed, wondering why he had lost so badly.The residents of Widener [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt450] had never known what tomake of Fong. They assumed he was Mexican or Native American or maybe African.The sign out front of town read “Population 92[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt451]”—even though in reality there were close to fourthousand African Americans residing there—and few locals had ever actuallyencountered a Chinese person before. The kids at school, however, understoodwhere he was from, and on his first day of school, in 1934, they heckled himwith a “Ching Chong Chinaman–kinda chant [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt452].” Laterthat day Fong [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt453] related the incident to his dad,thinking the boys were praising him. His father had to explain that it wasactually ridicule.Starting the very next morning, Fong got into a lot of schoolyard fights,responding to taunts by hitting kids quickly before they even knew what washappening. This typically resulted in the principal taking a paddle to Fong forhis actions, but it made little difference. Certain slurs were simply fightingwords, paddle or not, and before long his childhood was riddled with these typesof incidents.Fong and his family were the only Chinese for miles, running a local grocery inthe hostile atmosphere of pre–civil rights Arkansas. (“The racism was so deep[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt454],” explains Fong, “you would not believe it.”) Inaddition to the regular [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt455] schoolyard fights, twoother events would shape the remainder of his life. First, he suffered ahorrible fever around the age of eleven, which lasted for close to two weeks. Itwas so severe that it prompted Fong to promise God that he would become aminister if restored to health. He was, and he eventually did. Next, he foundthe book Fundamentals of Boxing [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt456] by former worldchampion Barney Ross. For a kid who already had a way with his fists, Fong’sformal interest in boxing grew with each page, and his fighting abilities werebolstered by the book’s detailed instruction. He would hang a pillow up in hisroom and work on the punch combinations each night as detailed by Ross.So walking home after [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt457] that first smoker fight, theteenage Fong had to wonder where he had gone wrong. Regardless of his opponent’ssuperior size, the loss had taken him unexpectedly. His mistake—namely, hisimpatience in the ring—finally dawned on him late that night.Fong sought out the smoker organizers the next day and requested another fight,much to their surprise. This time around he slowed the pace down, hanging backand hanging back and waiting for his opponent to show a flaw. When he did, Fonglit him up with a one-two straight out of the Barney Ross manual, securing thefirst knockout of his career. He felt right walking home that evening.From there he began fighting in the smokers regularly. He would slip around hisparents on Saturday nights and fight in all kinds of underground venues, ricketybarns and weed-infested backyards. Sometimes the fights would be heavilyattended; other times he would fight in front of ten people in someone’s garage.He was matched against local kids who didn’t have formal training but who were“raw bone strong,” conditioned tough from years of bailing hay and herding cows.Having at one time regarded him as a “tomato can,” the organizers soon hadtrouble finding Fong a willing opponent.Fong pursued boxing formally in college, training under Kirby “KO” Donohoe—theschool’s scrappy-minded coach. Once, after getting battered by an opponentthroughout the first few rounds, Fong asked his coach to throw in the towel, butinstead Donohoe just pushed him back out for another round. Fong won that fightby knockout in the next minute while on the ropes, learning the lesson of “asliding right [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt458]” maneuver against an advancingopponent, shifting his right foot backward even as he threw a punch forward withhis right hand. Yet even with a record [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt459] of 22-3, hislosses in the ring contributed as much to his evolution as his many victories,not unlike his experience with the smoker fights.Later the Methodist Church assigned him to a parish along skid row in Sacramento(one of the few congregations that would take a Chinese minister), relocatinghim out of the American South and over to California in 1954, when he was stillin his twenties. It was around this time that Fong gained exposure to othertypes of martial arts and fighting styles, causing him to wonder if there was abetter approach than boxing. After training at various schools with numerousteachers, Fong walked out of Kin Mon with James Lee in 1962 during the falloutwith T. Y. Wong.Now in Oakland, Fong found common cause with James in trying to distinguish whatworked, what was real, and what was just hype. Fong’s recent trainingexperiences had already provided him with some evidence, even if he struggled toglean what it actually implied. While Fong sparred with his[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt460] prior kung fu classmates, his boxing instinctsimmediately picked up on easy openings in his opponent’s defense, and he taggedthem up with little difficulty. But he never chalked it up to the merits of hisboxing abilities. Instead Fong figured that they were just going easy on him.It was actually Bruce Lee, in the coming year, who would urge Fong todifferentiate between martial arts fact and fiction.There were two notable martial arts books published in 1963. They were extremelydifferent from each other but equally significant in their own way. One wouldgain momentum [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt461] over time and eventually be reprintedfor decades to come, while the other would enjoy [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt462] aninitial popularity before slowly falling into obscurity.After months of enthusiastic [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt463] collaboration, JamesLee published Bruce Lee’s first book, Chinese Gung Fu: The Philosophical Art ofSelf-Defense. Similar to T. Y. Wong’s book a few years earlier, it was among thevery first titles published in English on the Chinese martial arts. Somewhatuncharacteristically [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt464], Bruce played it safe,publishing more of a primer for beginners than something that better reflectedhis far more modern and nuanced outlook. The book opened with[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt465] short author testimonials from James Lee, EdParker, and Wally Jay. In addition to the illustrated instructions (bothdrawings and photographs), Bruce committed space to his philosophicalperspective, emphasizing the concept of yin and yang in the execution of thetechniques. He not only showcased [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt466] some basic stylesand technique apart from Wing Chun but also included some of the “classical”approaches that he was becoming so openly critical of in that period. Comparedto the increasingly confrontational content of Bruce’s demonstrations at thetime, the book itself was straightforward and fairly innocuous.Conversely, Secret Fighting Arts [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt467] of the World, byJohn F. Gilbey, was billed as “a book crammed full [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt468]of secret fighting techniques never before divulged in print.” Gilbey’s bookhopped [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt469] around the globe from chapter to chapter,detailing all kinds of highly unusual fighting styles, such as the “TheLiverpool Nutter” (profiling a British master of the head butt) and the “GangesGroin Gouge” (fairly self-explanatory). A chapter about “The MVD Special”explains how a former Soviet secret service agent (kicked out twice for“over-zealousness”) had perfected an open-hand slap more powerful than awell-thrown fist. In the realm of the Chinese arts, Gilbey chronicles theoft-rumored technique of Dim Mak, “the Delayed Death Touch,” in which a mastercould merely tap an opponent at a certain point on the body during a certainhour to ensure his demise days or even weeks later. The “About the Author”section explains how Gilbey was “an heir to a textile[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt470] fortune” who “knows self defense like no otherman.”If it all sounds a bit ridiculous, it’s because it was—the book was a hoax[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt471]. Gilbey was the farcical pen name of Robert W.Smith, a unique figure and prolific writer in the early days of martial arts inAmerica. Like Gerda Geddes (and at about the same time), Smith was one of thoserare Westerners who through special circumstances became an early student of theChinese martial arts.A World War II veteran [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt472] with a degree in history,Smith spent time in the Red Cross before joining the U.S. intelligence services.In 1959 he was stationed in Taiwan, as a liaison to Chiang Kai-shek’snationalist government. With a background in boxing and judo, Smith spent hisfree time during his Taiwan assignment seeking out local Chinese martialartists. Most notably, he studied tai chi under Chen Man Ching (who likeGeddes’s teacher, Choy Hak Pang, was a student of renowned Yang-style masterYang Cheng Fu). When Smith returned to the United States, he began a longteaching tenure as one of the early tai chi instructors in America and wouldpublish numerous books on the martial arts for many years to come.In its simplest form Smith’s Secret Fighting Arts of the World was the result ofa vivid mind and incredibly wry sense of humor. But the parody[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt473] of it all was actually quite significant. Smithwrote the book as a way of illustrating the many far-fetched and outlandishtales that populate the martial art landscape, as well as the pervasiveinclination for Westerners to wholeheartedly believe them. Unsurprisinglyperhaps, a great number of readers took the contents of Secret FightingArts . . . quite seriously. For years to come Smith would receive lettersaddressed to Gilbey on all manner of peculiar topics seemingly related to hisbook.Anthropologist and martial arts historian Thomas Green remembers encounteringSmith’s book as a college student not long after it was first published: “Whatwe were reading in [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt474] that book was exactly what weall wanted to have. What young man doesn’t want to be invulnerable? And here areall these fantastic secret arts. The book contains such a mix of things thatappear to be accurate, alongside things that are just absolute fantasy, that itkeeps you guessing. I really wanted it to be true, as did my friends . . . andfor a while I ran into it everywhere I went.” Whereas a few decades earlier TangHao had tackled the same issues of folklore and hyperbole in the martial arts,Smith had taken a sly approach, applying a Mark Twain sense of satire to theissue (and as a result, evading blowback from the community).Yet while these two books from 1963 differed in a variety of ways, the authorsshared common [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt475] ground in that they would bothdedicate themselves to the same sort of reformist efforts as Tang Hao had yearsearlier, by conveying candid and often unpopular assessments of trends withinthe world of the martial arts. As Smith would later write in his memoir: “Somuch of what passes [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt476] for the fighting arts inAmerica and Asia is bogus. Except for judo, which has fairly consistentstandards, one is lucky to get the authentic in a sea of chicanery. Always andeverywhere it is hard to distinguish the thing from the version of thing.” Inthe days to come, Bruce would prove unflinching in voicing these sentiments notonly to colleagues like Fong but to a very wide cross section of the martialarts community.At the end of the year [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt477], Bruce made the drive fromSeattle to Oakland with his girlfriend Linda Emery shortly after the Christmasholiday. Emery was a freshman at the University of Washington who had beguntaking lessons with Bruce in Seattle earlier in the year, and while on break,they planned to travel down to Pasadena to watch the Huskies in the Rose Bowl(though really, Bruce just wanted to visit Ed Parker). Upon their arrival inOakland, James presented Bruce [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt478] with a finished copyof his book for the first time. It marked the end of an eventful year.In numerous ways 1963 had been good for Bruce. He had found a location[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt479] for his school in Seattle and given it theeponymous title, The Jun Fan Institute of Gung Fu. The business had enabled himto finally step away from the menial work of waiting tables and stuffing insertsinto newspapers.Over the summer Bruce [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt480] had traveled to Hong Kong forthe first time since he boarded an ocean liner in virtual exile four yearsearlier. It was a triumphant homecoming. Having left beneath a cloud of teenagetrouble, Bruce returned a university student and a business owner, with giftsand money for his family. They marveled at how mature he had become and, mostimportantly, Bruce’s father beamed with pride at his son’s growth intoadulthood.Now, at the year’s end, Bruce had also become a published author, withtestimonial support from a reputable array of modern martial artists. Perhaps itwas the sum total of these successes that would shape Bruce’s tone in the yearto come, when he would so openly air his criticisms of what he saw as the staticand ineffective nature of the martial arts in America.With James Lee, Allen Joe [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt481], and Linda in Oakland, bythe lights of the Christmas tree, Bruce toasted to the year ahead—to the Year ofthe Dragon. It would be one of the most eventful and pivotal years of his life."},{"pageContent":"PART 3 [unp-russo-0007.xhtml#toc]1964"},{"pageContent":"11 [unp-russo-0007.xhtml#toc]YEAR OF THE GREEN DRAGONSan Francisco | 1964The Year of the Dragon arrived in San Francisco’s Chinatown with epic andunprecedented fanfare.

Justover a week later, the celebrations collectively climaxed with the city’s annualChinese New Year parade. It was the largest that San Francisco had ever seen.City coordinators and police [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt482] brass were befuddledmanaging the roughly three hundred thousand spectators who packed the downtownsidewalks along the parade route for blocks on end, from Chinatown straightthrough the financial district. By 6:00 p.m., the crowd had grown so large thatthe rest of the city had devolved into a “monumental[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt483]” traffic jam. Both the Golden Gate[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt484] and the Bay Bridge were at a standstill, and to thesouth, the highway was backed up for miles down to the city of San Bruno.In Chinatown police barricades [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt485] were overrun asrevelers seeking a closer vantage point had narrowed the actual parade route toa mere ten feet across. Above the street level, spectators peered from atopmarquees and out of open windows, while others clung to lampposts, treetops, andfire escapes. SFPD patrolman William Goodwin [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt486], whohad worked the event for the past decade, remarked that he had never seenanything like it.The parade itself was [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt487] the largest ever assembled inthe holiday’s history, with more than two hundred eclectic groups ofparticipants, from high school marching bands to dance troupes to the manyelaborately decorated motorized floats. Mayor John Shelley waved from a vehiclein the parade’s vanguard, while a team of bagpipe players followed close behind.One reporter deemed the procession “a combination of marvelous[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt488] incongruities.”Lau Bun’s Lion Dance [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt489] team from Hung Sing made theirway down Grant Avenue just as T. Y. Wong and his squad[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt490] from Kin Mon roved the parade route further behind.Adorned in their best uniforms, the two teams had been a near-constant presencearound Chinatown throughout the month, performing at numerous banquets, parties,and street celebrations. They now made their way mindfully, careful to conducttheir lions [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt491] with skill, spirit, and properetiquette.As expected, the Forbidden City [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt492] float gainedconsiderable attention, though for unexpected reasons. Coby Yee, the star dancerwho had recently purchased the legendary nightclub from longtime owner CharlieLow, had generated some buzz earlier in the week with the float’s theme: “Aflower boat with [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt493] singing girls comes drifting downthe stream.” It was a line from the popular musical Flower Drum Song, and aconcept expected to be manifested to great effect by the club’s stunning femaledancers. However, the float briefly [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt494] caught fire atthe start of the procession and later completely broke down at the intersectionof Sutter and Grant, leaving “ten saddened beauties[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt495]” stranded in the street while the impaired vehiclewas frantically pushed away from obstructing the parade route.The loss of the Forbidden City dancers was tempered by the steady stream[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt496] of Miss Chinatown winners, past and present. One byone they appeared, waving from open-top convertibles, immaculately dressed andradiant with smiles. The current winner, Shirley Fong of Hawaii, appeared towardthe end of the procession, waving from atop an elaborate float that carried alarge pagoda made entirely of flowers.Amid Chinatown’s neon signs and hanging lanterns, the star of the festivitiesfinally [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt497] emerged into view amid the pop and bang ofmischievously hurled firecrackers and well-struck gongs. The 125-foot Gum Loong,the Golden Dragon, flashed with bright lights and roved the narrow parade routeatop the shoulders of sixty youths who tirelessly animated the silk and bamboocreature to full glory, much to the delight of the diverse crowd of denselypacked spectators. All timetables for what was meant to be a two-hour parade hadbeen abandoned. The celebration had taken on a life of its own, as if Gum Loongwas savoring the adulation of its admirers and proceeding through Chinatown atits own leisure.The next morning the San Francisco Examiner reported, “Parade officials didn’tknow [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt498] whether to boast or weep when it was all over.The crowd, biggest in the celebration’s history, exceeded all expectations.” Thepaper succinctly summed it all up with the headline: “Chinatown’s Greatest Night[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt499].”And so began the Year of the Dragon.Earlier in the month, the San Francisco Chronicle’s much-beloved columnist HerbCaen wrote, “In Chinatown, it’s the Year [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt500] of theDragon, elsewhere it’s the Year of the Beatle.” On February 9 the Beatles[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt501] triumphantly appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show (forthe first of three broadcasts), and youth culture appeared to shift almostovernight, a glimpse of the days and the decade to come. Bob Dylan had already[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt502] asserted as much just a month earlier, with thetitle of his third album, The Times They Are A-Changin’. Andy Warhol, theeccentric genius of the New York art scene, would characterize it by assertingthat 1964 was “the year that everything [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt503] wentyoung.”Many historians agree with Warhol in this regard. For all of JFK’s youthfulness,his presidency is typically lumped by academics into the same period of postwarprosperity as that of Eisenhower. It was Kennedy’s assassination that marked anew era in America, and the turbulence and change of what would be known of as“the sixties” was already surfacing in early 1964.Interestingly enough, one of the year’s (and really, the decade’s) bellwethermoments occurred just two days after Chinatown’s grand New Year celebration,within a boxing ring in Miami, Florida. On February 25 Cassius Clay[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt504] stepped into the ring against heavyweight championSonny Liston for what would be one of the most famous bouts in boxing history.For weeks Clay had been muddling the fight’s narrative with brash behavior and aseemingly unstoppable outpouring of trash talking. Liston had long been deemed avillain. His boxing career had begun in a Missouri penitentiary, where he wasserving time for armed robbery (later he would be incarcerated again forassaulting a police officer). Armed with massive fists “like cannonballs,” hehit with stunning power and quickly found his way to defeating Floyd Patterson[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt505] in a first-round knockout for the heavyweighttitle. Handsome and reserved, Patterson had been a popular champion, a figuregreatly preferred to the glowering ex-convict Liston. As LeRoi Jones (laterknown as Amiri Baraka) would peg it, Liston represented something menacing tomainstream America, calling him “the big Negro in every[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt506] white man’s hallway, waiting to do him in, deal himunder, for all the hurts white men have been able to inflict on his world.”Somehow, Cassius Clay [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt507] managed to make himself evenmore disliked than Liston. Defiantly outspoken and egotistical, thetwenty-two-year-old Clay spent the weeks leading to the fight trumping up hissuperiority over Liston with a loudmouth barrage of schoolyard-style taunts.Then, just prior to the fight, it had been reported that he was meetingregularly with Nation of Islam firebrand Malcolm X and was rumored to be on theverge of converting to the Muslim faith. Between his mouth and his affiliations,Clay soon presented a much greater dilemma for white America.Even though Liston was an 8 to 1 favorite by the night of the fight, Claydefeated him in six rounds, stunning the world. Two days later Clay announcedthat he was joining the Nation of Islam and changing his name to Muhammad Ali.Defending himself before the media (who, with the exception of Howard Cosell andjust a few others, continued to call him Cassius Clay) he asserted: “I don’thave to be who [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt508] you want me to be. I’m free to bewho I want.” It was a sentiment that would speak volumes about the youngergeneration in America in the days to come.Like the change destined to affect America throughout the decade, SanFrancisco’s Chinatown was on the verge of a new era as well. Thelong-established social exclusion, both in policy and perceptions, had begun todissolve in very tangible ways. At the time of the New Year’s celebrations, HerbCaen voiced staunch support for the Chinese as integral members of the Bay Areacommunity. For a writer known for droll metaphors and endless double meanings,Caen penned a column that was unusually earnest and straightforward: “It isunthinkable that anyone [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt509] would discriminate againstthe Chinese in San Francisco; no other group is so much a part of the city’shistory. They have contributed in every way possible, even to the point ofletting themselves become a Tourist Attraction by remaining, for the most part,in a section that has largely remained a ghetto. The suffering they underwent atthe hands of the white supremacists decades ago is part of the city’s shame.”Within a year the federal [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt510] government would rescindthe long-standing restrictions that prevented greater immigration from China.While the 1902 Exclusion Act was repealed by FDR in the wake of Madame Chiang’strip to the United States in 1943, it was actually the repeal of the 1924 actthat finally opened immigration in a full and robust way. This not only broughta new wave of people (and martial artists) to Chinatown but would inflame sometensions as well. The rise of Chinatown youth [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt511] gangsbegan to surface along lines of immigration and native identity. By the late1960s and early 1970s, the Chinatown gangs would engage in a stunning level ofneighborhood violence that harkened back to the Tong Wars of the late nineteenthcentury and would have a considerable effect on Chinatown’s economy.Furthermore, a series of new [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt512] laws throughout thedecade began to establish much-needed rules against discrimination in housing.Soon, as new residential opportunities finally became available for Chineseresidents in other parts of the city, many of the wealthier residents of thetightly bound neighborhood opted to relocate to more spacious quarters.The culture began to change as well. As spirited as Coby Yee’s[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt513] ownership of Forbidden City would be, her tenurecame as the neighborhood’s nightclubs were already in decline. Matters were thencompounded further when just a few blocks away, up on Broadway, local dancerCarol Doda made [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt514] national headlines after sheengaged in the unprecedented act of performing topless at the Condor Club inneighboring North Beach in June 1964. Soon, topless dancing was featured at theclubs all along Broadway Avenue (and were heavily attended when the city hostedthe Republican National Convention in July). It wasn’t long before the elaborateForbidden City floorshows seemed like a thing of the past.The old model of Chinatown’s martial arts community was set to change as well.Lau Bun and T. Y. Wong, along with the soft arts masters of the Gee Yah Sau, hadpresided over the neighborhood for a quarter of a century, and now, with thegrowing popularity of martial arts in America, the landscape was ready toexpand.Bing Chan opened his own [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt515] school on Jackson Streetin 1964. As a well-respected practitioner on the scene for years—first with ChanHeung (the little known Hung Gar master on Ross Alley) and then as one of LauBun’s senior students—Bing immediately began accepting both non-Chinese andfemale students. The timing was right for an evolution beyond the old tong code,and it was reflected in the softening of attitudes within the old guard. T.Y.had taken on Irish [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt516] teenager Noel O’Brien. At HungSing, Lau Bun was teaching Hawaiian [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt517] Clifford Kamagaand not showing open opposition to any of Bing Chan’s students.There was also a notable [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt518] newcomer on the scene.Wong Jack Man arrived from Hong Kong, a dynamic twenty-three-year-oldpractitioner of Northern Shaolin style. Clean cut, with a disciplined expressionthat suited his low-key demeanor, Wong Jack Man’s performances anddemonstrations of the northern arts quickly impressed the local community. Notonly was his style visibly different, but he proved “elegantly athletic[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt519]” in rendering it. He frequented the Gee[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt520] Yau Seah and worked as a waiter at the popularJackson Street Café. Quickly but quietly, he settled in as a new, young, andcaptivating martial artist in Chinatown.At the same time, in a sort of mirror image, another twenty-three-year-old fromHong Kong was dazzling people with his performances, but on the other side ofthe Bay.Bruce had something new to show off. He called it “the one-inch punch[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt521].”James Lee had put [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt522] a meeting together at his home onthe Monday night after Wally Jay’s luau. He assembled many of his currentstudents along with others who might be interested in studying with Bruce: AlNovak, Leo Fong, George Lee, and a few others, including a new student fromStockton named Bob Baker.With Bruce’s contentious showing at Wally’s luau a couple of days earlier freshon his mind, Fong was still uncertain [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt523] what to makeof the young kid from Seattle. George Lee, who had been[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt524] sold on Bruce’s abilities since his demonstrationat the Citizen’s Alliance dance way back in 1959, was thrilled to see himresurface again in the Bay Area.First, James announced [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt525] to everyone that Bruce wasgoing to be moving down from Seattle and that the two of them would be goinginto business on a new school. They had a location scouted on Broadway Avenuealong Oakland’s “Auto Row” and hoped to open in about a month.In deciding to move [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt526] to Oakland (where he wouldreside with James and his family on Monticello Avenue), Bruce had chosen to dropout of the University of Washington and concentrate more on his martial artsbusiness pursuits. (Initially James considered [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt527] theidea of moving his family up to Seattle, but the matter for Bruce to move toOakland was settled on the reasoning that the martial arts culture in the BayArea was far more robust than in the Pacific Northwest.) Taking a cue[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt528] from Ed Parker’s kenpo school model, Bruce was nowexpanding his operation to a second location.Standing in the center of the living room, Bruce talked for a bit[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt529] about his philosophy of martial arts. As he haddone at Wally’s luau a couple of days earlier, Bruce threw around the term“classical mess [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt530],” once again being outwardlycritical of what he saw as the ineffectiveness of what other Chinese teacherswere practicing. In contrast he stressed that his school curriculum with Jameswould emphasis simplicity and practicality. He then made clear that they weretalking about actual street-fighting skills. When he began speaking on theconcept of “explosive power [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt531],” he opted todemonstrate.Bruce moved the coffee table [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt532] to the side of theroom and then grabbed the hefty Oakland phone book and handed it to Bob Baker,one of the taller men in the room. Bruce had Baker stand in front of the couchand then positioned the phone book over his chest. Readying himself, he put astraight hand out, just touching the front of the phone book with his middlefinger, and then curled his hand into a fist, still in close proximity to histarget. The room was quiet, and then with a snap that seemed to reverberate fromhis hip through his wrist Bruce sent Baker over the couch.Fong and the other spectators were startled. “Bruce knocked him[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt533] into the couch,” explains Fong, “and Baker’s legswent straight up and over. I thought he’d go through the living room window.”As everyone settled down [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt534], Bruce explained that thepurpose of the demonstration was to illustrate how the power of a punch shouldcome not just from the arms and the shoulder but from a much greater portion ofthe body. The more the muscles relaxed, he said, the more power they couldgenerate. (It was a point that many of those in attendance had heard James Leemake on the topic of his own brick-breaking abilities.) Gung fu contrasted withharder styles like karate in this regard, Bruce concluded, by emphasizingnotions of softness as integral to the power within a technique.As the point hung in the room, James smiled and gave everyone an update on howthings would proceed. “Until the new school is ready[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt535], we’ll continue practicing in the garage,” heexplained. “Classes resume tomorrow.”The Oakland school would quickly take shape. The few people in attendance[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt536] were impressed, not just with the demonstration butwith Bruce’s perspective and his manner of articulating it. The guy was asalesman. Now, with his second school under way, Bruce was set to take themessage and the demonstration to a much larger audience."},{"pageContent":"12 [unp-russo-0007.xhtml#toc]LONG BEACHLong Beach, California | August 1964At the 1964 Summer [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt537] Olympics, judo was accepted intocompetition for the first time in the history of the games, a milestone formartial arts around the world. Later that summer, Ed Parker sought to[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt538] expand even further the credibility of martial artsas a legitimate athletic endeavor with his Long Beach International KarateChampionships during the first week of August.There had been a few [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt539] previous efforts to hold anational martial arts event: Arizona in 1955, and then Chicago and Washington DCin 1963 and 1964 respectively. These two more-recent competitions in particularwere hampered by widespread disorganization. (“Chicago was a real mess,”[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt540] recalled tournament official George Mattson.) Thisleft Parker striving to pull off a well-run and tightly organized event thatcould successfully draw together martial artists of myriad styles from aroundthe world, while also conveying a sense of athletic legitimacy.Having watched so many of Bruce Lee’s demonstrations, Parker invited him down[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt541] to perform. He was well aware of how potentiallyantagonistic Bruce’s perspective could be, but welcomed it all the same: “He(Bruce) was very [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt542] broad-minded about things—veryanti-classical kung fu: he felt that they were all robots. So I told him that ifhe were to come down to the tournament and demonstrate, people would have abetter cross section of the martial arts world.”Bruce was entirely disdainful [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt543] of the light-contactpoint-based competitions like the one that would be occurring in Long Beach,where judges assessed the quality of the maneuvers. (In fact, Bruce was known torefer to these types of competitions as “organized despair[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt544].”) But the opportunity to demonstrate and voice hismartial arts worldview to such an eclectic group of practitioners was anopportunity he could not pass up.When Bruce arrived [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt545] at Long Beach, Parker assignedDan Inosanto, one of his kenpo students, to drive Bruce around while in town. Atthe age of twenty-eight, Inosanto already possessed an extensive and fascinatingmartial arts background, having studied with an array of notable teachers. As achild Inosanto began his martial arts career learning karate (as well as somejudo and jujitsu) from his uncle. Later, when he joined the service in the late1950s, he studied as a paratrooper under Sergeant Henry Slomanski. In many waysSlomanski had brought [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt546] a Qi Jiquan–like effect tothe U.S. Armed Services, instituting a new emphasis on unarmed combat training.A big and imposing figure who studied karate as a noncommissioned army officerin Japan, Slomanski ran rugged training sessions that became notoriousthroughout the ranks for their no-nonsense physicality.After emerging from the service in 1961, Inosanto studied for a time[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt547] with kung fu master Ark Wong in Los Angeles. Likehis Hop Sing Tong peers, Lau Bun and T. Y. Wong up in San Francisco, Ark Wongwas among the very first Chinese masters to teach in America and was ahead ofthe integration curve when he took non-Chinese student Jim Anastasi as early as1959. From there Inosanto not only clocked time learning jujitsu from Wally Jaybut soon began studying kenpo with Ed Parker as well. Much like Leo Fong or evenBruce himself, Inosanto had a voracious interest in all things martial arts.Inevitably, as Bruce and Inosanto got to talking, the two of them began toexchange some techniques. Inosanto was shocked by the results: “I was completelyflabbergasted [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt548]! He controlled me like a baby—Icouldn’t do anything with him at all. He didn’t really have to use much forceeither—he just sort of body-controlled me. I’d lost to other people before butnot in the way that I lost to him: he was dominating the action completely,calling all the shots like it was a game. I couldn’t sleep that night. It seemedas though everything I’d done in the past was obsolete.” Just as with TakyKimura in Seattle and James Lee in Oakland, Bruce would soon develop a long-termfriendship and business relationship with Inosanto.The night before the tournament [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt549], many of Parker’sstudents and colleagues gathered in a vacant ballroom at their hotel for someimpromptu demonstrations. Dressed in a black leather[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt550] jacket and jeans, Bruce exuded a sort of movie starcool by his appearance alone.Taking the floor to demonstrate, he spared everyone the lecture that evening andjust got down to business, performing his closing-the-gap routine and a colorfularray of Wing Chun techniques, injecting brief ideas on speed and simplicity.In doing so he quickly commanded the attention of those in attendance. Aspioneering karate master Tsutomu Ohshima observed the gathering that evening, hegestured toward Bruce and told a colleague, “That one . . . is the only[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt551] one here that can do anything.”Like Ohshima, many observers in the room [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt552] markedBruce as someone special to watch at the official event the following afternoon.And indeed, the inaugural Long Beach International would be a seminal moment for[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt553] Bruce, for Ed Parker, and for martial arts inAmerica.The turnout at the [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt554] Long Beach Municipal Auditoriumon August 2, 1964, was enthusiastic, diverse, and very large. Dave Hebler, oneof Parker’s early students and a key organizer for the event, asserts that thecompetition alone drew a few thousand participants, an unprecedented turnout fora martial arts gathering in America.“It truly was international [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt555]; we got people from allstyles and all systems together,” Hebler explains. “In addition to being thelargest tournament ever, it was a social event, where martial artists could meetand form new relationships. We had people from all different styles givingdemos. Bruce Lee was one of the minor presenters. He wasn’t even the headliner.”Bruce’s demonstration was slated [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt556] later in the dayduring an unprecedented multicultural showcase of reputable martial artists,which included Jhoon Ree (“the Father of American Tae Kwon Do”), karate mastersRobert Trias and Tak Kubota (who had spent much of 1964 training CIA officers inself-defense), and Filipino Kali master Ben Largusa (who would give what waslikely the first public demonstration in America of the Kali arts).“My dad started the internationals [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt557] to showcase allof the martial arts together,” explains Darlene Parker. “He had reached out toeverybody, because he had so much respect for all of them. The event opened adoor into the martial arts for the rest of the world to see.”There in Long Beach, Ed [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt558] Parker had made history bysuccessfully orchestrating his martial arts congress, essentially applying theHawaiian melting pot dynamic to the culture as a whole. The event would run forthe next half century and marked Parker’s legacy as a visionary architect ofmartial arts culture in America.Bruce took the floor [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt559] in the center of theauditorium during a sluggish part of the afternoon. The air conditioner in thearena was down, and the day was growing long after hours of competitions hadplayed out.Dressed in a black jing-mo [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt560], Bruce was notablyyounger than the other demonstrators. After Parker introduced him as apractitioner of the little-known Chinese art of gung fu, Bruce emerged with TakyKimura as an assistant. Unlike his succinct [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt561]performance the night before, Bruce showed up with a big lecture in mind andintegrated it into a dazzling array of performances. “Bruce was absolutelyelectric [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt562] when he gave a demonstration,” explainsLinda Lee. And Long Beach appeared to be no exception.“I had seen it all [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt563] until I saw Bruce perform withhis philosophies, his concepts of martial arts and his speed and power,” recallsRichard Bustillo, a twenty-two-year-old boxer in the crowd that afternoon whowould later become one of Bruce’s longtime students. “I said . . . ‘This is realmartial arts.’”Bruce performed the Wing Chun [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt564] hand-sensitivitydrill chi sao to a flawless and impenetrable effect against Taky Kimura whilealso lecturing in the process. Then, after sending a volunteer from the audienceflying with the one-inch punch, Bruce got down on the floor to executetwo-finger pushups on each hand.These performances were immediate crowd-pleasers, enthralling many of those inattendance. In time, however, these demonstrations would be retold as if theyencompassed the entirety of Bruce’s showing at Long Beach. But as one of hisbiographer’s points out, Bruce was not just performing stand-alone stunts:“Although they were impressive, Bruce [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt565] was againstsimply doing “tricks” . . . if they had no real point to them. The real purposeof the inch-punch was to show that there is a far more powerful way of strikingsomeone than simply by using the strength of the arm and shoulder muscles.” Inthis regard the content of Bruce’s lecture at Long Beach was every bit asimportant as the demonstrations he employed to convey it. Like his contentiousshowing at Wally Jay’s luau, he took the floor to [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt566]air his criticisms of what he saw as ineffective and unrealistic approaches tofighting, and he intertwined those opinions with his own blazing displays ofspeed and ability. The sum total of his cocksure attitude, young age, andemphatic analysis didn’t jibe with the culture’s code of conduct. So once again,Bruce insulted a lot [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt567] of the established martialartists in attendance that day.“The prevailing attitude [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt568] that I was aware of atthat time,” says Dave Hebler, “was Bruce was kind of considered to be a bit ofan arrogant prick. But he had the right ideas: simple and effective materialthat works . . . and if it doesn’t work . . . don’t do it.”Barney Scollan, an eighteen-year-old competitor in the tournament that morning(disqualified for “kicking a guy in the nuts [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt569]”), wasimmediately compelled by what Bruce was saying. “He got up there and[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt570] began to flawlessly imitate all these otherstyles,” Scollan explains, “and then one-by-one he began to dissect them andexplain why they wouldn’t work. And the things he was saying made a lot ofsense. He even made an absolute mockery of the horse stance.”With this point in particular, Bruce wasn’t just airing criticisms, he was goingfor the jugular. The horse stance is [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt571] a foundationalaspect of numerous Asian fighting styles (from kung fu to karate to tae kwon do)and is drilled into students through long hours of practice, often from day one.Now, in front of an international array of teachers (many of whom were inattendance with their students), Bruce was ridiculing one of the core practicesof their martial arts training as just one more bit “of the classical mess[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt572].” He deemed the horse stance as entirelyimmobilizing for a fighter and a hindrance to generating greater punching power.As he put it, “There’s stability, but [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt573] zeromobility.” By contrast he then [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt574] demonstrated his ownmore fluid stance and the lightning fast punches he could deliver from it. Yetperhaps more than issues of mechanics were the big-picture concepts that Brucehad conveyed, and which, in time, would mark his martial art’s legacy.“He said the individual [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt575] was more important than anystyle or system,” Bustillo asserts. “That’s when I said, ‘I need to train with aman like this.’”On this point Bruce was inverting the equation of the martial arts status quo.“He was heavily into [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt576] personalizing the system,”explains Dan Inosanto, “and most instructors never personalized their systems.If a technique was done a certain way in Japan, then it was expected thateveryone would do it that way. And Bruce saw this as robotic: all thepractitioners had the same look.”This was a popular point [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt577] of discussion at thoselate-night sessions back in Oakland, and a consensus had formed there that thebalance needed to shift away from the system dictating the individual’s martialarts identity. As Leo Fong explains it, “Back then, it was[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt578] ‘I’m Okinawan style. I’m kung fu this style or kungfu that style,” and that was it. You didn’t dare deviate or go outside the box,because if you did, your teacher would say, ‘What the hell are you doing?’”There in Long Beach, before an international audience of martial artspractitioners, Bruce advocated for deviating way outside the box. “Teachersshould never impose [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt579] their favorite patterns ontheir students,” he reasoned. “They should be finding out what works for them,and what does not work for them. The individual is more important than thestyle.”As seemed to always be the case, opinions were split on Bruce and theperspective he was putting forward.Dan Inosanto, still having only just met Bruce, remembers the polarizedatmosphere in the crowd. “There was a high percentage[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt580] of people who were just in awe of him,” heexplains, “but then there is another group who was just really upset.”Clarence Lee, a longtime and well-respected karate teacher from San Francisco,had been a judge during the competitions earlier in the day, and he remembersthat Bruce’s attitude and his demonstration didn’t sit so well with many of themartial artists in attendance: “Guys were practically lining[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt581] up to fight Bruce Lee after his performance at LongBeach.”For others, though, like Scollan and Bustillo, Bruce’s viewpoint resonated in aprofound way. Months earlier Scollan [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt582] had gotteninto a street fight only to find himself hamstrung by his own horse stance,unable to evade the blows of his opponent and dumbstruck as to why the art ofkarate wasn’t proving superior. So while some martial artists at Long Beach wereoffended by Bruce’s criticism of the horse stance, practitioners such as Scollansaw it as a revelation, an assessment that addressed what he had experienced ina real-world fight situation.“Bruce made a number of [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt583] enemies that night,” saysScollan, “as well as a number of followers.”Jay Sebring was the hair [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt584] stylist to the stars.Through his men’s hair salon on Fairfax Avenue in West Hollywood, Sebring wouldalmost single-handedly revolutionize the industry, spurring an evolution fromwhite-coat male barbers to fashionable stylists. Over the course of his career,his clients would include figures such as Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando, JimMorrison, and Dennis Hopper. In time he would have salons around the world, inNew York, London, and San Francisco. At Long Beach, Sebring[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt585] had been one of the many spectators in the crowd atthe Civic Auditorium who was enthralled by Bruce’s demonstration.Sebring’s life was fated [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt586] to a tragic end in thecoming decade. In two months’ time he would meet and fall in love with SharonTate. In five years he would perish with her at the hands of the Manson family.For now in 1964, however, he was a unique Hollywood insider, racing cars onweekends with Paul Newman and hanging out with the likes of Steve McQueen. Hisposition as Hollywood’s premiere hair stylist brought him into an inner ring ofshow business.Not long after Parker’s [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt587] demo, Sebring was cuttingthe hair of William Dozier, an established Hollywood producer who had supervisedshows such as Perry Mason, The Twilight Zone, and Gunsmoke. Dozier was poised toachieve his biggest career success with the campy Batman television series. (Notonly was it Dozier’s [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt588] idea for the show to take sucha slappy tone, but he would be the uncredited narrator that audiences wouldremember for saying, “Same Bat-time, same Bat-channel.”)During haircutting chitchat [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt589] Dozier explained toSebring that he was currently looking to cast his latest project at TwentiethCentury Fox: a new Charlie Chan vehicle titled Number One Son. Sebring, stillfresh from Long Beach, had Bruce Lee come to mind . . . and made a suggestion."},{"pageContent":"13 [unp-russo-0007.xhtml#toc]INCIDENT AT THE SUN SING THEATEROakland | August 1964Barney Scollan couldn’t sign [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt590] up fast enough forBruce Lee’s school in Oakland. Not long after witnessing Bruce’s demonstrationsat Long Beach, Scollan relocated from Sacramento to Berkeley, where he began hisfreshman year at the University of California in the fall of 1964. He wasthrilled to learn that Bruce’s new school was practically down the block.Through vivid retellings of what he had witnessed down in Long Beach, Scollanconvinced two of his college roommates, Dick Miller and Bob Saunders, to attendthe school with him, and together they made the short drive over to BroadwayAvenue to enroll. The three young college students arrived at the Oakland branchof the Jun Fan Institute and waited patiently for Bruce to finish an earlierclass before speaking with him.“So, Bruce [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt591],” Saunders asked, after introductions,“why is your approach to martial arts so special?”Bruce raised an eyebrow, and then in a flash Saunders’s eyeglasses were on theother side of the room. Without ever touching him, Bruce had kicked the glassesoff of his face.“That is why [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt592],” he replied, with a smirk.Like Bruce’s peers up in Seattle, Scollan and his Berkeley[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt593] roommates were part of a generation that existed inan ever-present American street-fighting culture. “I would get into fights[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt594] all the time,” explains Scollan, “which was justreally stupid, but that’s how it was. If you went out to a dance or a movie, theodds were pretty good that you might tangle with some other guys by the end ofthe night.”In this sense the growing [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt595] national interest in theAsian martial arts was likely due in some part to their appeal as a means foryoung men to better navigate street fights. Yet a large portion of that appealappears to have been predicated on the romantic allure of the Eastern world andthe notion that the skills were in fact esoteric fighting arts that containedexotic methods and secret techniques.“There will always be [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt596] the macho thing of needing abetter way of beating up the guy down the street and proving yourself,” sayshistorian Thomas A. Green, “but in this case you’re proving yourself withsecrets. And it’s not doing push-ups or working the bag, it’s a secret techniquethat you have.”By 1964 Bruce was attempting to tackle the mythology of the martial arts headon, much like the Chinese historian Tang Hao had done decades earlier, by“emphasizing practicality and renouncing [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt597]embellishment.” Paradoxically, Bruce was pushing for realism even as he was alsoconstantly stoking the imaginations of observers toward the unrealistic. In thissense—of kicking the eyeglasses cleanly off someone’s face—his feats of speedand agility were not only drawing students to his business but were also weavingtheir own mythology in the process. Bruce’s students would increasingly attestto how he had become virtually “untouchable [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt598]” insparring sessions. George Lee remembers how [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt599] Brucecould snatch a quarter out of someone’s palm and leave a dime in exchange beforethe person could even close his hand. Bob Cook, a well-traveled[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt600] martial artist like Fong and Inosanto, allowedBruce to perform the one-inch punch on him and said it felt like “a hand-grenade[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt601]” going off in his chest. Like his demonstrations inLong Beach, Bruce’s seemingly uncanny abilities would resonate heavily withyoung men compelled toward the martial arts, particularly when presented withBruce’s emphasis on practicality. Even still, it made for a curious mismatch ofperceptions.More notably perhaps, was that Bruce tied his approach together by interweavinghis own sense of philosophy, a blend of classic wisdom he had learned during hisstudies at the University of Washington and insights he gleaned from the widerange of books he was always consuming, including many self-help books of theera. Bruce thought that the martial arts, when combined with these influences,became a means of personal cultivation, a way for the individual to reach his orher best potential. It is a perspective that has long been debated in martialarts circles: are the fighting arts just that—specifically for fighting? Or arethey a gateway to an individual’s improvement and evolution, or—as it iscommonly termed in the debate—self-actualization. In this regard Bruce differedfrom Tang Hao in that he genuinely embraced the philosophical (and almostspiritual) side of the field. And it was with this very point of philosophicalemphasis on the potential of the individual that Bruce would inspire many ofthose around him (and later, many others). Leo Fong, for instance, is just oneof many students who attest to Bruce having a profound impact on his life.By the summer of 1964, Fong’s Friday-night practice session had consistentlyturned into one of those long discussions of all things martial arts that hadbecome so popular with the Oakland camp since Bruce’s arrival. What had oncebeen quiet sessions between James and Fong now took on new dimensions as Brucecontributed his high energy 24/7 approach to those evenings.Fong was still trying to figure out where to land with his martial arts focus.He had a remarkable background in boxing, but in the face of the elaboratestories he heard about various Eastern styles and methods, Fong was questioningthe worth of his pugilism. During a Friday-night workout session, Fong relatedto Bruce his own experiences sparring with other kung fu practitioners, and howhe figured his success resulted from them going easy on him.Bruce laughed it off. “Leo, are you serious, man? [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt602]They just don’t know how to handle your boxing skills.” Finally adding up Fong’shabits, Bruce asked, “Is that why you have been practicing so many differentstyles?”“Yeah, Bruce, I’m [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt603] looking for the ultimate,” Fongreplied.“No, Leo [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt604],” Bruce said, putting his hand on Fong’schest over his heart, “the ultimate is in here. Stick with your boxing Leo, yourboxing is real.”A lot had happened in [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt605] Bruce Lee’s life after theLong Beach Tournament.Bruce had been apart from Linda Emery since he cut short his enrollment at theUniversity of Washington at the conclusion of the spring semester. Anxious tomake something of himself and expand his business into a new region, Bruce hadmoved south to Oakland to open his second school. By August he had returned toSeattle with a wedding ring lent to him by James Lee’s wife, Katherine.Linda’s family caught wind that that she and Bruce were poised to elope andpulled them in for a tense family meeting to register their protests. Theirmixed ethnicities were brought up as a major point of contention, in addition tothe normal family concerns about a young couple set on marrying. Bruce’s family,with their long history of interracial marriage, seemed to mildly prefer that hemarry a Chinese woman but otherwise expressed little opposition. On theseventeenth of August, the two married in Seattle and quickly relocated to livewith James and his family at his Monticello Street home in Oakland, where theywere soon expecting their first child. In the coming weeks[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt606] James’s wife, Katherine, tragically passed fromcancer. Now, living together and supporting each other through their personalbattles, Bruce and James became closer than ever.In the wake of his [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt607] Long Beach performance, Brucereturned home in Oakland one day to find a message waiting for him. “This guy[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt608],” Linda said, “this producer from Hollywood, calledyou and wants to talk with you.” Bruce got on the phone and spoke with WilliamDozier, who explained to him that he was producing a new Charlie Chan show andthat he wanted Bruce to audition for one of the key roles. (“We were both veryexcited [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt609],” Linda recalls.)In the meantime, Bruce went back out [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt610] on the roadfor a different bit of show business, hired to take the stage with the leadinglady of Hong Kong, Diana Chang Chung-Wen, as she toured Chinese communitiesalong the American West Coast. These engagements would bring them to the SunSing Theater in San Francisco’s Chinatown, the very same stage where Bruce’sfather had performed two decades earlier.Originally known as the Mandarin [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt611] Theater (beforebeing renamed in 1949), the Sun Sing had long been one of the premiere venues inChinatown. Situated on one of the busiest stretches of Grant Street, the theaterwas a key location in Chinatown’s opera (and then cinema) culture for manydecades throughout the twentieth century.Built in 1924, the Mandarin quickly eclipsed the aging Liberty Theater onBroadway to become the epicenter of Chinatown’s well-established opera culture.Residents of Chinatown weren’t welcomed in venues anywhere else around town, andmost couldn’t understand the language being used on stage anyhow. As a resultbusiness within Chinatown’s opera houses thrived. In the same period the newlyconstructed Great China Theater opened just one block east, down Jackson Street,to become the Mandarin’s prime competition for many years to come. The twovenues were constantly [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt612] trying to out-bill eachother with top-notch opera talent imported from China. In 1931 the Mandarin[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt613] even brought over Ma Sze-tsang—likely the mostfamous actress in southern China at the time—for an eighteen-month run.It was within this context, that the Mandarin Theater booked Bruce’s[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt614] father, Hoi Cheun, with other members of theCantonese Opera in late 1939. The theater had deep [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt615]enough pockets to post bonds with the Immigration Department for each individualit imported and paid the talent handsomely during their stay. However, by thetime of Hoi Chuen’s arrival to San Francisco, opera’s heyday in Chinatown[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt616] was on the descent. In the week before[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt617] Bruce’s birth at the Chinese Hospital in November1940, the Grandview Theater opened just a block down the hill on Jackson Streetas a state-of-the-art modern movie theater. It also served as the Americanheadquarters of the Grandview production company, which produced films (ofrespectable quality considering the low budgets) for export back to Hong Kong.It was under Grandview [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt618] that Esther Heng made GoldenGate Girl and bestowed a young Bruce with his first role. In time the MandarinTheater would shift [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt619] its own format to host operaperformances during the day and then screen films in the evening. Later OrsonWelles [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt620] shot scenes in and around the theater forthe film The Lady from Shanghai—with his estranged wife at the time, RitaHayworth—in 1946, shortly before it was rechristened as the Sun Sing.Just as the theater had done three decades earlier in securing one of China’spremiere actresses with Ma Sze-tsang, it was now hosting the leading starlet ofHong Kong cinema—“The Most Beautiful Creature [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt621] ofFree China”—Diana Chang Chung-Wen. As Paul Fonoroff, longtime Hong Kong Cinemacritic for the South China Morning Daily, explains it, “Diana Chang’s voluptuousfigure [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt622] and sexy demeanor helped make her a MandarinMarilyn Monroe of the late 1950s and early 1960s.”Born in Hebei Province [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt623] in northern China, Dianaeloped at the age of fifteen during the height of the war in 1941 and fled toTaiwan. Divorced two years later, she entered the film industry in her lateteens under Taiwan’s fledgling Central Motion Picture Corporation (where she hadanother short-lived marriage, to a studio executive).As Fonoroff describes it, her rise to cinematic fame was a colorful one:Diana made her Hong Kong [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt624] debut in Three Sisters(1957), notable for Chang’s rendition of “Chop Suey Roll,” sung to the tune of“Mambo Italiano” but with Chinese lyrics in which the amply endowed starletinvited listeners to partake of her cha shao bao (“roast pork buns”). Herpassionate kiss in the Hong Kong–Thai co-production Flame in Ash (1958) caused asensation, and she proved even more photogenic when filmed in Eastmancolor forCalendar Girl (1959).Diana was one of the busiest actresses in Mandarin pictures in the late 1950s,her credits including such escapist fare as Wild Fantasies (1958), Loves of aModel (1959), and Fire-Breathing Lass (1959) (which was also one of hernicknames).In the fall of 1964 Diana [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt625] embarked on a tour of theU.S. West Coast to promote her new film, The Amorous Lotus Pan. She wasscheduled to appear at Chinatown theaters from Seattle to Los Angeles. Throughhis father’s connections back home, Bruce was hired to accompany her along thetour, as well as dance the Hong Kong cha-cha on stage with her each night (andby some accounts, serve as a low-key bodyguard in the process).During the final days of August, the tour was scheduled for a stop at the SunSing Theater, where Bruce and Diana were told to expect a packed house. As hehad done to great effect for many years, Bruce was intent on seizing[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt626] a down moment in the official program to takecenter stage for a martial arts performance. It would be, after all, a greatopportunity to advertise his new Oakland school before all Chinatown. With TakyKimura and James Lee unavailable, Bruce recruited his new friend Dan Inosanto toserve as a stage partner. The demonstration that ensued would become forevernotorious among the Chinatown martial arts community.Although Bruce carried a small degree of fame—derived from his Hong Kongfilms—his reputation within San Francisco’s Chinatown by August 1964 was highlymixed. While neighborhood students [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt627] of his danceinstruction were very fond of him, members of the local martial arts sceneconsidered him a troublemaker with little respect for his elders. To them hetruly was the negative stereotype of a belligerent [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt628]and egotistical Hong Kong Wing Chun practitioner, and his 1959 run-in with LauBun had only reinforced this type of impudent persona. So while his cha-chaperformance that day may have been welcomed by some segments of the audience,his martial arts demonstration certainly was not by others.Furthermore, in a wider context there is evidence of lingering tensions[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt629] between James Lee and T. Y. Wong after their split,which pointed to antagonistic camps developing between Chinatown and Oakland. Inthis sense Bruce was regarded not as a lone practitioner but as a representativeof a rival faction. Indeed, it was T.Y. [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt630] who hadlabeled Bruce “a dissident with bad manners.”Not long after James left Kin Mon, T.Y. had published his[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt631] own new book on his Sil Lum system of Kung Fu.Toward the end of the book he included a section titled “Soft Hand Stunts[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt632],” in which T.Y. dismisses James Lee’s type of IronHand techniques as mere gimmickry, concluding “Do not waste your time[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt633] practicing this art.” To drive the point home, in anot-so-subtle insult, the final page ran with an image of T.Y.’s smalleight-year-old son mimicking the exact manner in which James had been portrayedbreaking bricks in the previous book, under the headline: “See, I Can Break[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt634] ’Em Too!”Soon afterward, while compiling [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt635] Bruce’s book, Jamesdonned his old Kin Mon uniform for a section of photographs that was meant toillustrate “examples of a slower system [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt636] against themore effective Gung Fu techniques.” In those pages James[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt637] is dismantled by Bruce in a photo-by-photodismissal of specific techniques featured in T.Y.’s previous book. Both titleswere readily for sale in Chinatown, and the slights could hardly have goneunnoticed among local martial artists.(In fact, years later, in the introduction of James Lee’s[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt638] 1972 book Wing Chun Kung-Fu, his language becamefar more blunt: “Wing Chun has made [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt639] a bigdifference in my life. Before taking it up, I studied the sil lum style, whichfeatured such forms as ‘A Dragon and Tiger in Conference’ and ‘Nine Dragons atSea.’ Not once during those years did I see students spar. We were told thatthis type of training would eventually lead to deadly ‘internal strength.’ Irealized later that the whole repertoire was just a time-killing tactic tocollect a monthly fee. In disgust, I quit practicing this particular sil lumstyle.”)James and Al Novak had also developed poor reputations among certain quarters inChinatown. They had made a habit [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt640] of hitting all theneighborhood bars and nightclubs after class at Kin Mon, which likely did notsit well with T. Y. Wong’s “sturdy citizen” mentality. When one of these outings[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt641] devolved into a vicious bar fight, James opened upa local resident’s jaw with a powerful left cross before coming back with asavage backhand that only further dismantled his opponent’s face (according toAl Tracy, this incident was so bad that the Hop Sing Tong demanded James pay forthe victim’s facial surgery). In this context the recent collaborations andbusiness ventures of James, Bruce, and Novak were seen by some as a collusion oftroublemakers.Yet however much these issues and incidents may have added to the tensionsbetween the Chinatown and Oakland martial arts camps, none were as incendiary[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt642] as Bruce’s contentious demonstrations throughout1964, from Wally Jay’s luau to his more recent showing in Long Beach. Stories ofwhat had been said began to trickle around the neighborhood: of Bruce dismissingother styles, criticizing what the masters were teaching as impractical, andasserting the superiority of his own system. Now, in late August 1964, thequestion was whether Bruce would have the nerve to say those same things fromthe stage of the Sun Sing Theater in the heart of Chinatown?Bruce started with a joke [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt643].Mentioning that his new book would be for sale in the lobby afterward, heconveyed a coy observation. “Unlike the Chinese [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt644],”he said, “I’ve noticed that Westerners don’t appreciate what they read.”Referencing the vertical nature of Chinese text, versus the horizontal renderingof English sentences, he said, “When they read in the East, you can see thatthey like it,” he explained, moving his head up and down as if saying yes, “butwhen a Westerner reads, they go like this,” now turning his head side to side,as if disagreeing, “because they don’t really enjoy it.”Getting a brief laugh from the crowd, Bruce motioned for Inosanto[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt645] and prepared to begin. Diana Chang had sung[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt646] a few of the better-known numbers from her filmsand then, as planned, danced the cha-cha with Bruce. Now, in betweenperformances, Bruce announced that he wanted to demonstrate the type of kung futhat he would be teaching at his new school over in Oakland.Bruce worked through [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt647] some basic Wing Chun conceptswith Inosanto as his target, emphasizing the practicality and efficiency of thesystem. He made a point of saying that it was free of so many of the unnecessarywasted motions found in the Chinese martial arts today. Whereas in Long BeachBruce had spanned cultures and styles, here he was talking solely about kung fu,and if he had started nice with some humor, it wasn’t long before he was alreadyusing the term “classical mess [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt648]” to disparage otherstyles. As he had done at the luau, he dipped into a bit of Northern Shaolin,before quickly dismissing the wide kicks as impractical. “Why would you kickhigh [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt649] and leave yourself open,” he said, pausing toallow Inosanto to counter. “Instead you can kick low and punch high,” heexplained while demonstrating each blow.Letting forth a blast of chain punches, Bruce remarked how he had brought hisskills from Hong Kong, and even there in China “80 percent of what they[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt650] are teaching is nonsense. Here, in America, it is90 percent.” This comment drew an uneasy murmur from sections of the crowd. Andthen Bruce really drove it home. “These old tigers[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt651],” he said, presumably referring to Chinatown’s oldmasters, “they have no teeth.”A cigarette butt was [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt652] tossed toward the stage indisgust. More followed. Savvy to the etiquette of stage culture, Bruce knew thisto be no small insult.“Bruce was saying [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt653] these things that were offensiveto the Chinese martial arts,” explains Inosanto, “and they didn’t like that sortof attitude coming from a young sifu.”Toward the far back of theater, a male audience member, seemingly making his wayto the exit, turned to shout, “That’s not kung fu [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt654]!”Bruce smiled, “Sir, would you care [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt655] to come up onstage so I can demonstrate?”The departing spectator shot back as he continued toward the exit. “You don’tknow [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt656] kung fu!”Bruce tried now to salvage his demonstration, asking, “Would anyone else care[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt657] to volunteer?”In the lower-left seats [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt658] facing the stage, a handshot up. Bruce, anxious to gain control over the situation, quickly called thevolunteer up.Sixteen-year old Adeline [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt659] Fong sat with some of herfriends, close to the stage. Born and raised in Chinatown, Fong came from afamily that was deeply involved in the neighborhood’s opera culture (in fact,her “great uncle” operated the Great China Theater on Jackson Street). At theage of eight, a good friend of her older sister—“Auntie” Gwynn—caught herjaywalking and pulled her into Chan Heung’s Hung Gar school on Ross Alley tokeep her out of trouble. Gwynn was a very early and enthusiastic fixture of theneighborhood martial arts scene who in her efforts to keep Fong safeinadvertently started her kung fu training at a young age. Later Fong wouldenroll with Bing Chan and become one of the first females in Chinatown toperform with a Lion Dance team. When her stepfather heard how serious she wasabout her studies, he arranged for her to also train with Lau Bun, essentiallyexposing her to a uniquely wide cross section of what the neighborhood martialarts culture had to offer.Fong attended the Sun Sing that night with a sizable group of students from BingChan’s school. When Bruce asked for a volunteer, her classmate Kenneth Wongdidn’t hesitate to raise his hand, much to the mischievous delight of his peers.“When Bruce called Kenneth [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt660] up, we began cheeringand hollering,” she explains, “egging him on.”Like Bruce, Kenneth was known as a bit of a hotshot.Kenneth Wong ignored the stairs [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt661] and just leapt ontocenter stage. This elicited some howls from his friends in the nearby row, andlaughter from other sections of audience.Bruce thanked him for volunteering and explained the demonstration he wanted toconduct. Instead of the one-inch punch, Bruce set the stage for his typicalroutine of closing the gap and tagging his opponent on the forehead, emphasizingspeed and streamlined footwork. It was the same bit that he had alreadyperformed numerous times, including at Wally Jay’s luau and the impromptugathering the night before the Long Beach tournament. As always he explainedthat he would close from a wide distance of a few feet to deliver a light blowto the volunteer’s forehead. He asked Kenneth to attempt to block him.The two practitioners were ready, even as the crowd remained noisy. Bruce movedin fast. Kenneth blocked the blow clean. The crowd now roared. Bruce steppedback and motioned to go again. The volume in the theater stayed high. Brucebolted in and delivered his blow. Blocked. And again. Blocked.And as the crowd was near frenzy now with cheers and heckles, Kenneth steppedback and shifted to an offensive pose: fists up and outward toward the opponent.And for a brief moment, an explosive tension held heavy over the theater, as ifright there on stage Chinatown’s martial arts culture was finally going tosquare off against its detractor.Realizing that the entire demonstration was completely off the rails and thatthe crowd was quickly going from surly to riotous, Bruce stepped back andsmiled. He then offered an obligatory word, “Thank you for participating[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt662].” The crowd erupted, reveling in his loss. A freshround of cigarettes rained forth.And then, stepping to the edge of center stage, Bruce signed off[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt663] with a comment that is still hotly debated to thisday in Chinatown martial arts circles: “I would like to let everybody[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt664] know that any time my Chinatown brothers want totry out my Wing Chun, they are welcomed to come find me at my school inOakland.”And with that Bruce left the stage, leaving many in the crowd to wonder—did hejust put out an open challenge to all of Chinatown?The neighborhood was abuzz.“Bruce talked about how there were no good martial artists in America,”explained James Wing Woo, a longtime local kung fu practitioner, “and word ofthat went quickly around Chinatown.”Descriptions of the errant demonstration were enthusiastically retold down inHung Sing. At the Jackson Street Café, word reached Wong Jack Man that Bruce hadperformed and dismissed Northern Shaolin on stage. Word trickled into Kin Monduring the evening’s class. Bing Chan heard about the incident and scoldedKenneth Wong for not retaliating against Bruce. Down Old Chinatown Lane membersof the Gee Yau Seah discussed what had occurred.If Bruce’s final statement was being interpreted as a challenge, the questionnow was if anyone would step forward to meet it.In the coming weeks [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt665] a letter was drafted.Wong Jack Man sat down [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt666] at the Jackson Street Caféafter finishing his shift waiting tables, joining David Chin and Bing Chan. Chinwas a regular at the Gee Yau Seah, a young practitioner in his midtwenties whostudied Fut Gar under Mah Sek, the aging Qi Gong master who was widely known forhis fantastical demonstrations.They were also joined [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt667] by Ronald “Ya Ya” Wu, a closefriend of Chin. Wu had little connection to the Gee Yau Seah or martial arts inChinatown. His nickname, Ya Ya, was a reference to his constantly yammeringmouth. One longtime Chinatown resident remembers Wu as “the sort of guy[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt668] that always had to insert himself into things.”The group concerned itself [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt669] with penning a formalnote to Bruce Lee in response to his words at the Sun Sing. Although thecontents of the actual letter have likely long been lost to a wastebasket, thegeneral consensus is that it sought to take Bruce up on his offer to “try out[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt670]” his Wing Chun. By the time the note was draftedand the small meeting at the Jackson Street Café concluded, it was Wong Jack Manwho had signed his name to the letter.Why Wong Jack Man, of all the people in the Chinatown martial arts community,had stepped forward remains a matter of much debate. Chin asserts that Wong[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt671] had stated right there in the Jackson Café that hewas set to open a Northern Shaolin kung fu school in Chinatown, and that beatingBruce Lee would give him immediate prestige. Others saw it as merely[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt672] a macho gesture, spurred on by so much of thepraise that Wong had received after recent demonstrations. Perhaps he wasgenuinely incensed by Bruce’s insulting dismissal of the Northern Shaolin artsand intended to set the record straight by way of his fists. Among the moreprevalent [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt673] perspectives is the idea that Wong hadbeen manipulated into the entire affair, the new kid in town naively lured intoa fight without realizing the stakes.Whatever the case, Chin soon made the trip across the Bay to hand-deliver theletter in Oakland. “I brought the note [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt674] to BruceLee,” Chin says, “and he looked at it and laughed, and said, ‘Okay, set thedate.’”This started a back-and-forth [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt675] over San FranciscoBay that went on for weeks. Bruce seemed unwilling to back down from the fight,but neither did he pursue it. He refused to fight in Chinatown and maintainedthat they would have to come to him instead.As word of an impending showdown spread, anticipation began to build. Leo Fongheard a story that Wong Jack Man possessed a technique called “the vibratingfist [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt676],” in which he could strike an opponentTaser-like, rendering him stunned from the blow. Meanwhile, as Chin traveledbetween the two potential participants, many began to consider him[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt677] more an instigator than a messenger.Regardless of the rumor mill, Bruce held firm to his position: if they wanted afight, they’d have to come over to Oakland to get it.The matter was settled [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt678] on a weekday in November.The weather was sunny and pleasant. A frantic excitement spread around sectionsof Chinatown.Bruce’s childhood friend Ben Der, now living again in San Francisco, caught windof the impending showdown. “The day of the fight [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt679],”he explains, “everybody was talking about it. And everybody in the neighborhoodseemed to favor Wong Jack Man.”Now assigned to a parish in Stockton, Leo Fong got a call from James Lee in thelate afternoon: “It’s all going down [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt680], man. Come onover.” Caught on short notice, Fong couldn’t make the drive in time. Heanxiously told Jimmy to call him back right after the fight and let him knowwhat happened.Sam Louie recalls word [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt681] coming down into Hung Sing,urging the senior students to go over to Oakland with Wong Jack Man. As dislikedas Bruce was within Lau Bun’s school, the affair was beyond the bounds ofconduct that their teacher permitted. For years Lau Bun had prevented the localmartial arts culture from devolving into a Hong Kong–style challenger culture.“We said, ‘It has nothing to do [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt682] with Hung Sing,’”Louie recalls. “And we explained to them, ‘You go into someone’s studio . . .it’s no good. Whether you win or lose . . . it’s no good.’”By then the anticipation [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt683] and adrenaline were toofar along to be curbed. As the sun dipped low to the Pacific, Wong Jack Man gotinto a car and headed east, toward the city of Oakland."},{"pageContent":"14 [unp-russo-0007.xhtml#toc]EXCHANGING HANDSOakland | November 1964James Lee bolted the door [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt684] from the inside, the snapof the lock sending a charge through the already amplified atmosphere.Wong Jack Man had arrived [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt685] at Bruce Lee’s school at4157 Broadway in north Oakland with five other people in tow. The many weeks ofback-and-forth had finally culminated in a showdown.Bruce Lee stood facing [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt686] them at the center of theroom, blaring hostility. Behind him James returned to the rear of the studio tostand beside Linda. Outnumbered and unsure of just how many people were bound toshow up, James kept a concealed handgun in case things spiraled out of control.David Chin had driven [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt687] the Chinatown group over theBay Bridge in his beige Pontiac Tempest (“three sitting up front[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt688] and three in the back”) as autumn twilight fell onSan Francisco Bay. The martial artists had sat clustered in the front seat:Chin, Wong Jack Man, and Chan “Bald Head” Keung. A well-respected tai chi[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt689] practitioner, Keung was a longtime fixture of theGee Yau Seah and was the oldest member of the group, in his midforties.In the backseat [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt690] Ronald “Ya Ya” Wu sat with MartinWong and Raymond Fong. They were all at least a decade older than both Wong JackMan and David Chin and carried the feel of mischievous hanger-on types, peoplewho wanted to feel close to the action (“only there to see[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt691] the hubbub,” as Wong Jack Man would later explain).Yet for all the bluster in Chinatown that day, the ride over was unusuallyquiet.They arrived at the Jun Fan Institute on Broadway Avenue in the early evening,and approached the two-story brick building. Formerly an upholstery[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt692] business, the location’s front door was recessedbetween glass showcase windows, and right inside the entrance a single step leddown to the interior floor. The space was narrow: ten to fifteen feet across andabout thirty feet deep, before another short step that led up to a partitionseparating off the back room. Lee had kept the studio simple and uncluttered. Astudent of his at the time remembers the school as “very unremarkable[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt693].”The Chinatown group stood near the front door, opposite the three Lees furtherinside, the space between them dense with tension. “It was serious business[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt694],” Linda Lee recalls.In time Wong Jack Man [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt695] would try to spin thescenario into a more harmless context, asserting that he merely wanted to engagein a friendly sparring match. Chin, like Linda Lee, dismisses this notion aspure revisionism. “It was not a friendly [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt696]atmosphere,” he asserts. “The challenge was real.”David Chin stepped forward to introduce Wong Jack Man and articulate theirintent. Bruce was having none of it: “Shut your mouth[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt697] . . . you’ve already gotten your friend killed.”The back-and-forth started in English, then hastily shifted in and out ofCantonese. Bruce pressed Wong on whether he had actually been at the Sun Sing,which he admitted he had not. When Chin tried to interject some ground rules,Bruce kept the tone harsh: “You came to my school to challenge me and now youwant to set the rules?”The Chinatown crowd briefly turned inward to confer. Perhaps they had finallybegun to realize that Bruce’s often-cited cockiness didn’t stem from shallowegotism but from a genuine confidence: he really did believe he could beat anyand all challengers. In this regard it was difficult to determine which fighterwas underestimating his opponent.Bruce barked toward their huddle, letting them know that high noon was the wronghour for second guesses. “As far as I’m concerned [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt698],”Bruce shouted, “there are no rules. It’s all out!”However contested the actual reasons for the fight were, the match-up itself hada singularly spectacular symmetry: two highly promising twenty-three-year-oldkung fu practitioners wielding inverse styles of Shaolin and representingopposite shores of the bay.Their appearances alone spoke to the yin-yang-like dynamic that existed betweenthem. At five feet seven and a mere [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt699] 140 pounds,Bruce stood in a tank top and jeans. Like the fight with Yoiche in Seattle, hisopponent had arrived [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt700] formally dressed. At five feetten and about [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt701] the same weight as Bruce, Wong JackMan wore a traditional black jing mo, making him look far more handsome andnaive than formidable or menacing.Although fairly new to the area, Wong had an unassuming and[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt702] low-key personality that quickly endeared him tomany in Chinatown. Bruce, on the other hand [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt703], wasentirely polarizing. He was known by many to be cocky, hyperactive, andoutspoken. His close friends, by contrast, regarded him as charismatic, highlymotivated, and fiercely loyal.If the old boxing adage, “Styles make fights, [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt704]” wastrue, then the impending bout would be stellar. As a practitioner of[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt705] the Northern Shaolin arts, Wong Jack Man’sabilities were expansive, acrobatic, and oriented around long-range attacks. Hewas known for his kicking abilities, which—according to one student—could bedelivered with “blinding speed and crushing power [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt706].”Conversely, Bruce practiced [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt707] a Southern Shaolinstyle—Wing Chun—which was short, linear, and economical. His abilities wereanchored around an uncanny agility of the hands and otherworldly displays ofspeed, manifested in barrages of direct punches. Whereas Bruce had refuted thepracticing of forms as “dry-land swimming [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt708],” Wongwas said to have mastered “close to a hundred of them[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt709] at the time.”Both men had spent [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt710] their early years growing up inHong Kong, learning kung fu from established Chinese masters, beforetransplanting to the Bay Area. Whether intentional or otherwise, Wong Jack Manwas representing the long-established and more traditional martial arts cultureof Chinatown, while Bruce was a member of a very new and modern camp in Oakland.Up until that very [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt711] moment, the two men had actuallynever met.“Step forward [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt712],” Bruce demanded in Cantonese.As Wong Jack Man emerged forth, Bruce was intent on replicating hiseleven-second victory in Seattle from a few years earlier. Like so many other oftheir viewpoints, Bruce shared a similar philosophy with James, who was known tooften articulate these situations in stark terms: “If you get in[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt713] a fight, you’ve got to take the guy out in thefirst ten seconds. You can’t give him a chance. Just destroy him.” So whether itwas this Oakland street-fighter code of quickly putting an opponent down or theold notion of a true master defeating an opponent in three moves or less, Brucesought to end [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt714] the conflict quickly.Now in the late stages [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt715] of pregnancy, Linda Leewatched with detached cool. “I suppose I ought [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt716] tohave been nervous,” she recounted later in a memoir, “Yet, the truth is that Ifelt quite calm and composed under the circumstances. . . . I had no doubt thathe [Bruce] could take care of himself.”Wong stepped into range [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt717], and Bruce took theinitiative. As in the demonstration he so often exhibited, Bruce saw his chanceto quickly close the gap and land a blow. Even in light of his recent failurewith the technique at the Sun Sing Theater, Bruce didn’t hesitate to seize onthe opening and execute it, but instead of a mere tap to the head, he darted inand delivered [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt718] a sharp punch to Wong’s temple, justnarrowly missing his eye. The tone of the fight was set. As Wong would convey toone of his students years later, “He really wanted [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt719]to kill me.”Bruce pressed in, anxious [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt720] for a fast resolution.Wong resorted to defensive maneuvers, sidestepping to avoid Bruce’s straightassaults and using his forearms to deflect the blasts. By Chin’s account[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt721] Bruce employed low kicks to close in and thenadvanced with a flurry of punches. The melee soon [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt722]moved through the building as Wong sought to evade his enraged attacker.Shifting to offense, Wong delivered a wide diagonal blow—“like an ax punch[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt723] coming down”—that narrowly missed Bruce’s chin andinstead caught him across his lower neck. For Bruce, who had been so untouchablein recent years during both chi sao and sparring, the blow stoked his fury evenfurther. Now approaching a frenzy, he pressed in on Wong with blasts of “chainpunches [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt724]”: a rhythmic succession of rapid blows thatkeeps the hands high in defense even as they are used offensively.Despite the seemingly high-quality match-up, opposing a practitioner who hadtaken to calling his martial arts approach “scientific street fighting[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt725]” with a Northern expert known for[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt726] his elegance, the fight was quickly devolving intoa wild and sloppy brawl that spilled across the entire room.Wong sidestepped again as he deflected with his arms. In then backpedaling[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt727] away from Bruce, he stumbled over one of the smallriser steps that came up from the studio floor. Bruce was over him now,relentless with his punches, shouting in Cantonese: “Do you yield[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt728]? Do you yield?” Having lost his feet, Wong hadlittle choice.“From there [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt729],” explains Chin, “he said he gives upand we stopped the fight. The whole thing lasted . . . not more than sevenminutes.”Wong Jack Man and his [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt730] mismatched entourage got backinto Chin’s car and returned to San Francisco. In Chinatown they went upstairsto the Chin Family Association on Washington Street and applied a hardboiled eggto Wong’s eye as a way to reduce the bruising. The mood was sullen.Back in Oakland the atmosphere was far from triumphant. “After the fight, Bruce[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt731] sat down on the stairs in the back of the studio,”explains Linda Lee, “and he told me that he was so disappointed in himself,because the fight lasted way too long, that he couldn’t get him [Wong] downright away, and that he was winded from running around.”Even as Linda would maintain that Wong was “soundly defeated[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt732],” the fight was a far cry from Bruce’s dominantvictory over Yoechi years earlier in Seattle. After expounding all year in frontof so many other martial artists about the ineffectiveness of so manypractitioners and their techniques, Bruce now sat quietly in his school,wrestling with his own shortcomings.The following afternoon Bruce’s childhood friend Ben Der returned to Chinatownanxious to catch word of what had transpired.“The day before, everybody [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt733] was talking about it,”he recalls, “saying how exciting it was gonna be. So I purposefully went down toChinatown the next afternoon to see what everyone was saying. And it was deadquiet. Nobody was saying anything. And that’s how I knew Bruce Lee won thatfight.”"},{"pageContent":"15 [unp-russo-0007.xhtml#toc]AFTERMATHSan Francisco/Oakland | November 1964There had actually been [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt734] an agreement between thetwo camps to keep the incident quiet. However, that pledge of silence[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt735] quickly unraveled on November 26, when a localChinese newspaper reprinted an absurd account of the fight that had recently runin the celebrity gossip column of the Hong Kong Ming Bao Daily, alleging thatthe two combatants had actually been battling over the affections of Diana ChangChung-Wen.This then opened [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt736] the floodgates, sparking a hugewave of gossip around Chinatown about what had actually occurred, and like anygood schoolyard brawl the postfight chatter was heavy on hyperbole. Three weeksafter the initial article, Bruce gave an interview to the local Chinese PacificWeekly, in an attempt to clear up some of the assertions in the originalarticle, particularly its connection to Diana Chang. This then sparked[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt737] its own flurry of published responses, includinganonymous letters to the editor and classified ads that were run like op-eds.Collectively, these missives debated numerous aspects of the incident, from thetangible (how many people were present, how long the fight lasted) to theoutlandish (the manner in which Bruce Lee had fainted).This all played out in a very public way, making the fight a hot topic inChinatown and among the Bay Area martial arts scene not just in the immediateaftermath of the incident but for many years (and really decades) to come.Before long it began [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt738] to sound like dozens of peoplewere actually witnesses to the fight.“Lots of people claim [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt739] that they were there,” statesChin. “I’ve heard all kinds of things: people say they broke up the fight, thatthey were the judge, that they knocked on the door and slipped in to watch. It’samazing how many people love to make these claims, but it’s not true. Theyweren’t there.”Indeed, stories from secondhand sources would attach all sorts of exaggerateddetail to the match, at times straying wildly from the simple narrative of thosein attendance; some insisted that the actual fight went for over twenty[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt740] minutes, that Bruce slammed Wong’s head[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt741] through a wall, or that Wong had Bruce in[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt742] a headlock and was poised to knock him out rightwhen the police showed up. In Hong Kong, Bruce’s mother heard[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt743] that he had been killed in the fight.There was a quality to all this that harkened to the classic Akira Kurosawa film[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt744] Rashomon, which explores issues of truth, memory,and self-interest, amid contradictory accounts given by different characters whoare recounting the very same incident. In this manner the Bruce Lee–Wong JackMan fight can read like a case study in the fickle nature of human memory. Forexample, Ming Lum [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt745], a well-liked veteran member ofthe Chinatown martial arts scene, would recall that he saw Wong Jack Man workingat the Jackson Street Café the very next morning after the fight, with a smallscratch above his eye. Ben Der, on the other [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt746] hand,asserts that Wong Jack Man missed two days at the café before returning to work,and when he finally did he was sporting a massive black eye (“like a panda[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt747].”).As with Rashomon the various accounts can seem to directly contradictory oneanother, though more likely, they are just intentionally selective. David Chin,very frank about the matter decades later, concedes, “I’ve always felt bad[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt748] for Wong Jack Man, so I would tell people it was adraw.”Just as with Wally Jay’s early shortcomings in judo competitions or Leo Fong’sinitial defeat at the smoker fights, so too would the stilted outcome of theWong Jack Man fight have a tremendous influence on Bruce’s evolution as amartial artist. The impact was as tangible [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt749] as itwas immediate.Fong showed up for class in Oakland later that week to find Bruce punching at aboxing glove he had hung on a chain from the ceiling and “bouncing around like[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt750] Muhammad Ali.”After the fight had occurred, James Lee had given Leo[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt751] Fong a call to report back on what had transpired.Eventually the phone was passed to Bruce, who explained to Fong that hisopponent’s evasiveness posed a real challenge for him. Fong responded bysuggesting that Bruce integrate more boxing technique into his repertoire:“Bruce, you gotta get [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt752] some angles, man, straightblasts alone don’t do it. You need to develop some uppercuts, some hooks.”The timing was right. Bruce had already been in the process of synthesizing somany of the influences that he had been exposed to in recent years, from JamesLee’s street-fighter sensibility, to Leo Fong’s boxing aptitude, to Wally Jay’ssense for innovation, among many others. He began formally developing[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt753] a new integrated fighting approach that would bringtogether the best aspects of what he considered the most effective styles andnuanced techniques, yet all integrated around his emphasis of personalizing thesystem to the individual. In this regard the disappointing results in the WongJack Man fight had provided a catalyst to finally enact something new.To begin with, Bruce was resolved to [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt754] take hisphysical conditioning to the next level. After becoming so quickly winded duringhis fight in Oakland, Bruce resolved that fitness could no longer be a secondpriority. And with Allen Joe and James Lee as mentors, he soon took to seriousbodybuilding with his typical zeal.On a conceptual level the fight had made an even bigger impact. As Linda Leewould later write:The fact that the fight [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt755] did not go the way Brucewanted it to go initiated the idea that he should not be stuck on the systemthat he had learned in wing chun. . . . He realized that he had become stuck tothose techniques and that he needed to broaden his array of skills to deal witha situation as it is unfolding. You cannot predict what is going to happen in afight. . . . You just have to react to what is presented to you. And that waspart of Bruce’s broadening, both philosophically and technically.Writing to Taky Kimura shortly after the fight, Bruce informed him: “My mind ismade up to [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt756] start a system of my own.” A few monthslater he would describe it to James Lee, by writing, “This system is acombination [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt757] of chiefly wing chun, fencing andboxing.” In time Bruce would give it the name Jeet Kune Do, which translated as“the way of the intercepting fist.” Being fond of the stop-hit technique infencing (essentially employing an attack as a way of countering an opponent’sattack), Bruce applied a term that emphasized this type of method. Yet Jeet KuneDo would be notable as much for its philosophical underpinnings as for itsdiverse and nuanced sense of technique. With JKD Bruce sought to design anapproach that would transcend stylistic parameters and the dogmatic conditioningthat he felt they entailed.And much as he had done in Long Beach, Bruce placed the emphasis on theindividual: “True observation begins [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt758] when one shedsset patterns, and true freedom of expression occurs when one is beyondsystems. . . . The core of understanding lies in the individual mind. . . .Truth cannot be perceived until we come to fully understand ourselves and ourpotentials. After all, knowledge in the martial arts ultimately meansself-knowledge.”This notion, of Bruce Lee’s advocacy for an individual’s self-awareness,lifelong evolution, and sense of boundless potential, would be at the core ofhis legacy and in time would inspire people well beyond the field of martialarts.Standing there watching him dart and move around the suspended boxing glove,Fong suspected that Bruce was now poised for a bold step in his own personalevolution: “He was popping right jabs [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt759] and followingwith the left, one-two. It was beautiful. He knew how to interpret stuff andintegrate it into what he was doing. And I thought to myself, ‘Man, nobody isgonna touch him now.’”For all the outlandish gossip that would surround the big Oakland showdown,there were a few key points that would remain particularly controversial overthe years. To begin with, there is debate that the opening blow that Bruce[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt760] landed—the most successful of the entire fight—wasdelivered while Wong Jack Man was actually trying to shake hands. There has alsobeen considerable speculation about whether Wong Jack Man was evading Bruce in adefensive posture or simply fleeing from him [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt761] in apanic (the Oakland camp would long refer to Wong Jack Man as “the runner[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt762]”). The fight also provided critics within themartial arts community with perceived evidence of each practitioner’sshortcomings, to the effect that Wong Jack Man could only[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt763] do forms and couldn’t really fight, while Brucelacked [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt764] “knock-out” power and was far more talk thansubstance.Clearly though, the hottest issue surrounding the fight was not the outcome butthe cause. In time the prevailing [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt765] sentiment thatemerged was the idea that the bout had been fought over Chinatown’s oppositionto Bruce and James Lee teaching kung fu to non-Chinese students.This narrative suggests that the original note sent to Oakland via David Chinwas a sort of cease-and-desist letter handed down from the top brass in thetongs reprimanding Bruce for allowing non-Chinese students to study with him. Inthis context Wong Jack Man was sent over in the role of enforcer to drive themessage home with fists, and that the true stakes of the fight were whetherBruce could continue to operate his school.This idea would come to dominate the fight narrative over time (culminating in abizarre Hollywood rendering of the affair decades later) and effectively nestleitself into the iconic and glossy mythos that would shroud Bruce in the years tocome. Yet as tangible as the exclusion code was, martial artists from the BayArea widely express skepticism at the idea of it being the core reason for thatparticular fight.“It was never about that [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt766],” says Leo Fong. “Itreally had to do with Bruce’s personality.” Al Tracy, who asserts that Brucedropped by his kenpo school on Ocean Avenue the following Monday to lay out thewhole story for posterity’s sake, agrees with Fong: “It’s very simple: the fight[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt767] was a result of Lee’s big mouth. The Chinese wantrespect, and when Bruce said, ‘These tigers have no teeth,’ that fight wasinevitable.” Al Novak couldn’t explain the theory either, saying, “I thinkthat’s mostly [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt768] made up.” Clarence Lee dismisses theidea as well and instead explains the fight between the twotwenty-three-year-olds in his typical terse, no-nonsense fashion: “Have you everheard [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt769] of macho bullshit?”Indeed, a survey of the martial arts landscape in Chinatown up to late 1964renders notable examples of non-Chinese students studying with local masters,including Noel O’Brien [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt770] in Kin Mon and CliffordKamaga in [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt771] Hung Sing. T. Y. Wong had not only[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt772] performed on television but had also produced twoEnglish-language books and trained Al Novak as early as 1960. Ed Parker wouldoften [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt773] visit the old Chinatown masters whenever hewas in town and would buy jars of herbal ointment from Lau Bun. The newestschool [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt774] in the neighborhood, Bing Chan’s Lup Mo, hadoffered open enrollment from the get-go. Altogether then there is substantialevidence that the old tong code was well into its final throes by the time ofthe Bruce Lee–Wong Jack Man showdown.However, that’s not to say that the idea should be dismissed altogether. Afterall, the exclusion code was very [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt775] prevalent duringLau Bun’s generation in Chinatown, and Bruce himself dealt with it[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt776] in tangible ways throughout his life, with Ip Man(both as his student and then later during his 1963 trip home), with Ruby Chow,and at times with spectators at his demonstrations.The racial line didn’t have an official clear-cut end date in the Chinesemartial arts, as say, in Major League Baseball when it allowed Jackie Robinsoninto the league as the first African American. And even still, as in the case ofRobinson, integration didn’t mean the complete evaporation of racism andexclusion.In this sense a little-known incident in Chinatown at the end of the decadeprovides an interesting and nuanced postscript to the debate surrounding theOakland fight.By the end of the 1960s [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt777], tai chi master Choy KamMan gained a curious following. Just as his father, Choy Hak Pang, had attractedGerda Geddes as a student in 1950s Hong Kong, Choy Kam Man soon found himselfwith a sizable following of young San Franciscans (“hippies,” by most accounts)learning tai chi with him in Chinatown.Michael Gilman, who would become one of his senior students, vividly remembershow he first encountered Master Choy: “There was a meeting out[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt778] at Winterland in 1968 with a lot of spiritualteachers of the era, Timothy Leary, Alan Watts, and figures like that. Over in acorner away from the stage, I encountered Master Choy with some of his studentsperforming tai chi. I had never seen it or heard of it before, but I wasintrigued. Something struck me about the movements. The fliers for the classescalled it ‘mediation in motion.’ So I signed up and was with him for years.”Soon enough, Master Choy began to draw a huge following to the Chinatown YMCAfor his Saturday tai chi salon. His young following even got him slotsperforming on stage at the Fillmore Auditorium before Grateful[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt779] Dead concerts. It was a curious relationshipspanning both generations and cultures, though strangely fitting for the timesand indicative of the booming popularity of the martial arts that wasmanifesting itself by the end of the 1960s.Around 1972 Choy began to receive threatening phone calls in the middle of thenight, warning him to stop teaching non-Chinese students. This went on formonths, harassing Choy and his family with very grave threats. Choy refused tocave in. Finally, he challenged his anonymous aggressors to meet him to settlethe matter.Choy and Gilman (who, years later, still confesses that he was “scared shitless[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt780]”) ventured to the predetermined site in theneighborhood only to find Choy’s opponents [unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt781] to be ano-show. The calls stopped coming. Gilman asserts that Choy[unp-russo-0031.xhtml#gt782] was positive that the harassment had come fromother martial arts masters within the neighborhood.The incident raises an important point for consideration. If the code couldstill apply to a well-respected insider like Choy as late as 1972, then surelyit could have applied to Bruce—an outsider and perceived troublemaker—yearsearlier.There is, however, another theory [unp-russo-0032.xhtml#gt783] about the originof the Oakland fight, which still quietly persists around Chinatown. In thisscenario Bruce’s demonstration at Sun Sing was not the last straw for theChinatown martial arts community. Yes, it riled everybody, but there is evidenceof an additional incident that was more formally responsible for provoking theconfrontation.Some time in early autumn of 1964, Bruce Lee apparently questioned the abilitiesof the aging Qi Gong master Mah Sek. A long-standing member of the Gee Yau Seahand a close friend of Lau Bun, Mah Sek was a highly respected master (who was inhis late eighties at the time) and was widely known within California martialarts culture for his unique feats of the body. Purportedly, Bruce Lee not onlyexpressed skepticism about Mah Sek’s skills but also boasted that he was goingto personally “try him out.” This was perceived as a sign of immense disrespect,and allegedly when word of this got around, Chinatown had finally had enough.This theory is interesting because it not only explains why the fight took aboutten weeks to happen after the contentious demonstration at the Sun Sing Theaterbut would also account for why members of the Gee Yau Seah (David Chin, WongJack Man, Chan “Bald Head” Keung) were so closely involved. Most notable perhapsis that this perspective implies that Wong Jack Man did in fact go over toOakland with a purpose as handed down from top brass within the community.There is an interesting point of reference to this as well. Later in his careerBruce had an incident where he essentially did “try out” the internal methods ofanother master. As Bruce’s former student Doug Palmer recounted it:Several masters from other schools [unp-russo-0032.xhtml#gt784] were with Bruceon a television show, a benefit for charity, as I recall. At any rate, one ofthe other masters was bragging about his “internal Chi,” his inner power,goading Bruce and challenging him to strike his stomach. The master stood in aready stance, one arm at his side the other pointing at his stomach, insistingthat Bruce hit him there. Because of his internal Chi, he said it was impossibleto hurt him. Bruce approached. The master insisted again. Bruce struck him ablow right on the nose, not that hard but enough to shock him. The master jumpedback, startled and incensed, demanding to know what Bruce was doing. “Any onecan learn to resist a blow he is prepared for,” Bruce said. “A Gung Fu man mustbe prepared for the unexpected.”This is a good example of the kind of behavior that was so upsetting to theChinatown martial artists and suggests what Bruce might have meant when he saidhe would “try out” Mah Sek. Whatever the case, it still speaks to the idea thatBruce’s conduct and personality were ultimately at the root of the fight.Regardless of the actual cause for the Oakland showdown in 1964, the idea thatit was over the right for Bruce to teach non-Chinese students would plague WongJack Man [unp-russo-0032.xhtml#gt785] for years to come, despite the greatvariety of pupils he would teach over the course of his career.By late January 1965 the neighborhood gossip about the fight had gotten sooutlandish that Wong Jack Man finally gave [unp-russo-0032.xhtml#gt786] anaccount to the Chinese Pacific Weekly, in his own attempt to set the recordstraight. The article ran large on the front page alongside a dramatic pictureof him performing a full split atop two chairs while holding a sword steadilyaloft over his head. Like the interview Bruce had given one month earlier, Wongdenied starting or losing the fight.Surprisingly though, Wong went so far as to assert that his trip to Oakland wasoriginally meant to be amicable, or rather “to have a friendly visit[unp-russo-0032.xhtml#gt787].” The article concluded with an interestingsentiment: “[Wong] says that in [unp-russo-0032.xhtml#gt788] the future he willnot argue his case again in the newspaper, and if he is made to fight again, hewill instead hold a public exhibition so that everyone can see with their owneyes.” Although not an exact quotation from Wong, the wording isinteresting—“made to fight [unp-russo-0032.xhtml#gt789]”—and hints at thepopular theory that he had been manipulated into the affair. Ever inclined tointerpret things on the side of a challenge, Chinatown’s martial arts culturewidely regarded Wong’s final sentiments [unp-russo-0032.xhtml#gt790] as a callfor a rematch.Yet by the time this article ran on January 28, Bruce had numerous big thingshappening in his personal life. A second fight with Wong Jack Man was likely thelast thing on his mind.With the Chinese New Year, on February 1, 1965, Linda Lee gave birth[unp-russo-0032.xhtml#gt791] to a baby boy. Their first child, Brandon Lee,arrived at Oakland Hospital, as the Year of the Green Dragon had finally come toan end.Three days later Bruce caught a plane down to Los Angeles, for an opportunity inHollywood."},{"pageContent":"EPILOGUE [unp-russo-0007.xhtml#toc]SCREEN TESTLos Angeles | February 1965As Bruce arrived in Los Angeles, the current issue [unp-russo-0032.xhtml#gt792]of Black Belt Magazine found on newsstands featured local kung fu master ArkWong on the cover, beneath the headline “Special: Ancient Fighting Arts ofChina.”Wong was the first Chinese martial artist ever to appear on the magazine’scover, and for many of the publication’s readers, it would be their first realexposure to the art of kung fu. Most important was Wong’s overt acknowledgmentwithin the magazine that his door was open to every type of student. As a memberof the Los Angeles chapter of the Hop Sing Tong, his published assertion was theclosest thing to an official ending of the old tong segregation code surroundingthe Chinese martial arts.In this sense the Chinese code had run parallel to the American policy ofexclusion. The two had mirrored each other for a long time and then wound downin unison. A new era was beginning. As historian Ben Judkins puts it: “1965 wasa pivotal year [unp-russo-0032.xhtml#gt793] for the traditional Chinese martialarts in North America. Simply put, it was the moment when everything changed.”Lau Bun passed in 1967 [unp-russo-0032.xhtml#gt794], truly marking the end of anera. His career was a bridge to the modern age of the Chinese martial arts inAmerica. As a pioneer who predated much of the martial arts media that surfacedin later years, he is scarcely acknowledged for his foundational contributions.Fifty years after his death, Hung Sing still operates[unp-russo-0032.xhtml#gt795] in San Francisco. It is one of the oldest martialarts schools in the nation.T. Y. Wong relocated [unp-russo-0032.xhtml#gt796] Kin Mon up to SacramentoStreet, where he taught into the midseventies. Amid the many martial artsmasters who claim to be the first to accept non-Chinese students, T.Y.’strailblazing contributions often go unacknowledged.Master Choy taught a diverse [unp-russo-0032.xhtml#gt797] array of students foryears to come throughout Northern California. His family played a key role inthe proliferation of tai chi all over the world.Mah Sek practiced [unp-russo-0032.xhtml#gt798] kung fu into his late nineties,until one afternoon he told his students that his friends and family were allgone and that he was tired of living. He passed just days later.David Chin now teaches Tibetan Hop Gar in North Carolina. His views on themartial arts today echo many of the things Bruce Lee expressed during hisdemonstrations fifty years earlier: “The things Bruce was[unp-russo-0032.xhtml#gt799] saying back then were true. I disagreed with him atthe time, but he was right. And now even today, people still want to bury theirheads in the sand.”After his fight with Bruce Lee, Wong Jack Man distanced[unp-russo-0032.xhtml#gt800] himself from many of the martial artists inChinatown but continued to teach until [unp-russo-0032.xhtml#gt801] hisretirement in 2005. The fight would—quite unfairly—attach itself to hisreputation for the rest of his life.In May 1965 Muhammad [unp-russo-0032.xhtml#gt802] Ali fought Sonny Liston in arematch, and the results would be forever shrouded in controversy. Ali knockedout Liston in the first with a quick right—the “phantom punch[unp-russo-0032.xhtml#gt803]” as it would be known—that had many immediatelyalleging [unp-russo-0032.xhtml#gt804] a fix, inferring that Liston simply took aclumsy dive. Their rematch had played out in front of 2,500 spectators and wasbroadcast on national television, while some of the world’s best sportswriterswere sitting ringside. Even still, the results of just what happened remainhotly contested by historians and biographers some fifty years later. Bycontrast Bruce Lee’s fight with Wong Jack Man happened behind closed doors, withseven witnesses. In this sense it is unsurprising that their fight in Oaklandremains subject to all manner of speculation and hyperbole.With the change in immigration laws, Chinatown saw a fresh[unp-russo-0032.xhtml#gt805] crop of martial artists arrive throughout thedecade and establish their own long-term schools within the neighborhood: YCWong, Brandon Lai, and Kuo Lien Ying were among the new masters who taught formany years and carved out legacies of their own.In Chinatown gangs began [unp-russo-0032.xhtml#gt806] to form among theneighborhood youth, and by the early seventies the ensuing violence aroundChinatown was severe. The wealthier residents took advantage of new housingopportunities and moved to outlying areas. Many of the theaters, nightclubs, andopera houses fell into decline. In a sort of grand social irony, the heyday ofChinatown ended just as true equality for its residents had barely begun.James Lee passed in 1972 [unp-russo-0032.xhtml#gt807]. Like Lau Bun and many ofthe other old masters of Chinatown, his role in martial arts history is oftenunsung. Kenpo master Al Tracy calls James “one of the great missing[unp-russo-0032.xhtml#gt808] pieces of the martial arts in America.”Many of Bruce Lee’s other colleagues around the Bay Area—Wally Jay, RalphCastro, Al Novak, Leo Fong—taught for decades, their students over timecollectively numbering in the many thousands. When asked how many[unp-russo-0032.xhtml#gt809] students Wally Jay had taught in his lifetime, hiswidow, Bernice, takes on a look of wonder, as if asked to unravel a complexalgorithm.Ed Parker’s model [unp-russo-0032.xhtml#gt810] for kenpo karate schoolseventually spread to locations all over the United States. One longtime kenpopractitioner surmises that the influence and infrastructure that Parker firstbegan to lay out in the 1950s would over the years be responsible for millionsof people practicing the martial arts in America.There’s a hint of nervousness [unp-russo-0032.xhtml#gt811] to Bruce Lee as hesits and waits for his screen test to begin. Dressed sharp in a black suit witha black tie and sporting an immaculate haircut, it is little wonder that AllenJoe took him for a male model that night at Ruby Chow’s years earlier.His very presence in Hollywood was no small irony. Despite his time as a childactor in Hong Kong, Bruce never pursued show business upon his return to theUnited States. He never sought an agent, or went to casting calls, or sentaround head shots. Instead, he immersed himself in the martial arts along theWest Coast and in doing so caught Hollywood’s attention.Sitting there with his hands folded, waiting to begin, Bruce was on the cusp ofbeginning to accomplish what he told his godfather about over dinner on hisfirst day back in the United States six years earlier: “I would like to let[unp-russo-0032.xhtml#gt812] the world know about the greatness of the Chinesemartial arts.” It is hard to not consider it in fateful terms.As the film rolls, a clear male voice speaks out from off-camera: “Now Bruce,just look [unp-russo-0032.xhtml#gt813] right into the camera lens right here andtell us your name, your age and where you were born.”Bruce takes a breath and shifts in his seat.“My last name is Lee [unp-russo-0032.xhtml#gt814]. Bruce Lee. I amtwenty-four-years-old. I was born in San Francisco.”"},{"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTS [unp-russo-0007.xhtml#toc]This book and the history it contains are based on a multitude of interviewswith key sources from the era.

The synthesis of martial,therapeutic, and religious goals has been a primary reason for the popularity ofhand combat both in its native land and in the modern West. If modern handcombat is not only a fighting method but also a system of thought, then it isnot surprising that its evolution was partially spurred by intellectualdevelopments. Late Ming syncretism provided a philosophical foundation for theintegration of bare-handed fighting and daoyin calisthenics, permitting Daoistmystics to explore Buddhist-related martial arts and allowing Shaolin monks tostudy Daoist gymnastics.”Yet away from the elite [unp-russo-0013.xhtml#rgt172]: Judkins interview.

The original text runs as follows: “During the early 19th century(before the market reforms of the Republican era) China had a huge number oflocal fighting styles. Most of them were very small village or family affairs. Alot of what they did actually focused on militia training, opera or banditry.Many of these styles did not actually have names, though there were some notableexceptions. Why did so many of these pedagogical systems lack names? They werenot studied so much as a particular ‘style’ of fighting (or in the case ofopera, acting). They simply were fighting (and acting). Later in the 19thcentury as the demand for martial instruction increased, and the number ofreasons it was pursued diversified, it became necessary to market these skillson a broader scale than had been undertaken in the past. Names and shiny newcreation myths began to appear as the fighting techniques of the previousgeneration were increasingly repackaged as a ‘martial commodity.’”Just as the Bodidharma [unp-russo-0013.xhtml#rgt175]: Shahar, Shaolin Monastery,181.“The goal of most martial arts” [unp-russo-0013.xhtml#rgt176]: Kennedy and Kuo,Chinese Martial Arts Training Manuals, 34.“invented tradition” [unp-russo-0013.xhtml#rgt177]: Judkins interview.For Wing Chun [unp-russo-0013.xhtml#rgt178]: Wing Woo interview.It was in an era [unp-russo-0013.xhtml#rgt179]: Kennedy and Kuo, Chinese MartialArts Training Manuals, 38–60.

I highly recommend theseessays for their detail and insight into Bruce’s formative teenage years as wellas the atmosphere of Ip Man’s school. For example, as Cheung explained on thetopic of real fighting experience: “Back in the 1950s, Yip Man trained us tofight, not be technicians. Because we were so young, we didn’t understand theconcepts or theories. As he taught us, Yip Man said, ‘Don’t believe me, as I maybe tricking you. Go out and have a fight. Test it out.’ In other words, Yip Mantaught us the distance applications of wing chun. First he told us to go out andfind practitioners of other styles and test our wing chun on them. If we lost,we knew on what we should work. We would go out and test our techniques again.We thought to ourselves, ‘Got to make that technique work! No excuses!’ Welearned by getting hit. When you are in a real fight, you find out whattechniques are good for you. Just because your technique may work for one persondoesn’t guarantee it will work for you. When you test your techniques on someoneyou don’t know, you experience a different feeling than when training with yourfriends. If you discover through your own experience, it’s much better thanrelying on another’s experience.”His sister Agnes notes [unp-russo-0014.xhtml#rgt227]: Thomas, Bruce Lee, 25:“Bruce’s sister Agnes says, ‘He began to get into more and more fights for noreason at all.

Withinthe nuance of it, however, there are some really fascinating conclusions todraw. In looking at other Chinese martial arts schools in America circa 1960,you would be hard-pressed to find a class as racially diverse as Bruce’s inSeattle. For this reason many of the Seattle students like to joke that theclass looked “like the United Nations.” In this regard Bruce Lee genuinely was apioneering force of the Chinese martial arts in America years before he wasfamous via Hollywood (especially when considering that he was among the first—ifnot the very first—to teach Wing Chun in the United States). Furthermore, andperhaps more notably, as Bruce’s teaching in Seattle become more formal, he hada significant number of female students, which was also very rare at the time.When Ruby Chow, the stern [unp-russo-0016.xhtml#rgt280]: Jesse Glover, in Bax,Disciples of the Dragon, 24.Bruce was settling nicely [unp-russo-0016.xhtml#rgt281]: Thomas, Bruce Lee,35–42; interview with Ed Hart, in Bax, Disciples of the Dragon, 23–24; Gong,Bruce Lee, 17–19.“We were all dummies” [unp-russo-0016.xhtml#rgt282]: Bax, Disciples of theDragon, 49.Open to drawing on more [unp-russo-0016.xhtml#rgt283]: Interviews with TakyKimura (10–11), Jesse Glover (26), and James Demile (28–29), all in Bax,Disciples of the Dragon.

Smith would have been appalled to be lumped together with Bruce Lee onthis point. In fact, the quote, “So much of what passes for the fighting arts inAmerica and Asia is bogus,” is taken from a chapter in Smith’s memoir in whichhe skewers Bruce Lee and his role in the prevailing perceptions of the martialarts. I could write a lengthy article on this topic, and ultimately I wouldconclude that Smith was unable to distinguish what Lee was doing on screen withwhat Lee was doing in the garage on Monticello Avenue in Oakland. By onlyconsidering the former and not the latter, I think Smith assessed Bruceincorrectly. After all, the quote cited above sounds remarkable similar to whatBruce was already saying in the early 1960s.“So much of what passes” [unp-russo-0021.xhtml#rgt476]: Smith, Martial Musings,342.At the end of the year [unp-russo-0021.xhtml#rgt477]: Allen Joe, personalinterview by the author, June 18, 2014; Linda Lee interview.

Noticethe similarities: “I went through the air with the one-inch punch. In JamesLee’s living room. We were skeptical, like, ‘C’mon, one inch?’ And he said,‘Okay.’ So he moved the coffee table out of the way, and he had me stand with apillow from the couch. And I was holding it like this, like in a footballstance. And he went—whap. And I flew, hit the couch, the couch tipped over, andI was almost about to go through the living room window when my roommates caughtme. I outweighed Bruce by like thirty or forty pounds.
