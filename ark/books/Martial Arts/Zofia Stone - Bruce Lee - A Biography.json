Lee was the son of Cantonese operastar Lee Hoi-Chuen. He is widely considered by commentators, critics, media, andother martial artists to be one of the most influential martial artists of alltime, and a pop culture icon of the 20th century. He is often credited withhelping to change the way Asians were presented in American films.Lee was born in Chinatown, San Francisco on November 27, 1940 to parents fromHong Kong and was raised in Kowloon, Hong Kong with his family until his lateteens. He was introduced to the film industry by his father and appeared inseveral films as a child actor. Lee moved to the United States at the age of 18to receive his higher education, at the University of Washington, at Seattle andit was during this time that he began teaching martial arts. His Hong Kong andHollywood-produced films elevated the traditional Hong Kong martial arts film toa new level of popularity and acclaim, sparking a surge of interest in Chinesemartial arts in the West in the 1970s. The direction and tone of his filmschanged and influenced martial arts and martial arts films in the US, Hong Kongand the rest of the world.He is noted for his roles in five feature-length films: Lo Wei's The Big Boss(1971) and Fist of Fury (1972); Golden Harvest's Way of the Dragon (1972),directed and written by Lee; Golden Harvest and Warner Brothers' Enter theDragon (1973) and The Game of Death (1978), both directed by Robert Clouse. Leebecame an iconic figure known throughout the world, particularly among theChinese, as he portrayed Chinese nationalism in his films. He trained in the artof Wing Chun and later combined his other influences from various sources, inthe spirit of his personal martial arts philosophy, which he dubbed Jeet Kune Do(The Way of the Intercepting Fist). Lee held dual nationality of Hong Kong andthe US. He died in Kowloon Tong on July 20, 1973 at the age of 32."},{"pageContent":"Early life & FamilyBruce Lee was born on November 27, 1940, at the Chinese Hospital, in SanFrancisco's Chinatown. According to the Chinese zodiac, Lee was born in both thehour and the year of the Dragon, which according to tradition is a strong andfortuitous omen.Bruce's father, Lee Hoi-chuen, was Han Chinese, and his mother, Grace Ho , wasof half-Chinese and half-Caucasian descent. Grace Ho was the adopted daughter ofHo Kom-tong (Ho Gumtong) and the half-niece of Sir Robert Ho-tung, both notableHong Kong businessmen and philanthropists, and was a reportedly a half-GermanCatholic. Bruce was the fourth child of five children: Phoebe Lee , Agnes Lee ,Peter Lee , and Robert Lee . Lee and his parents returned to Hong Kong when hewas three months old.Lee's Cantonese birth name was Lee Jun-fan . The name homophonically means\"return again\", and was given to Lee by his mother, who felt he would return tothe United States once he came of age. Because of his mother's superstitiousnature, she had originally named him Sai-fon , which is a feminine name meaning\"small phoenix\". The English name \"Bruce\" is thought to have been given by thehospital attending physician, Dr. Mary Glover.Lee had three other Chinese names: Li Yuanxin , a family/clan name; Li Yuanjian, which he used as a student name while he was attending La Salle College, andhis Chinese screen name Li Xiaolong (Xiaolong means \"little dragon\"). Lee'sgiven name Jun-fan was originally written in Chinese as , however, the JunChinese character was identical to part of his grandfather's name, Lee Jun- biu. Hence, the Chinese character for Jun in Lee's name was changed to the homonyminstead, to avoid naming taboo in Chinese tradition.Lee's father, Lee Hoi-chuen, was one of the leading Cantonese opera and filmactors at the time, and was embarking on a year-long opera tour with his familyon the eve of the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong. Lee Hoi-chuen had been touringthe United States for many years and performing at numerous Chinese communitiesthere.Although many of his peers decided to stay in the US, Lee Hoi-chuen returned toHong Kong after Bruce's birth. Within months, Hong Kong was invaded and the Leeslived for three years and eight months under Japanese occupation. After the warended, Lee Hoi-chuen resumed his acting career and became a more popular actorduring Hong Kong's rebuilding years.Lee's mother, Grace Ho, was from one of the wealthiest and most powerful clansin Hong Kong, the Ho-tungs. She was the half-niece of Sir Robert Ho-tung, theEurasian patriarch of the clan. As such, the young Bruce Lee grew up in anaffluent and privileged environment. Despite the advantage of his family'sstatus, the neighborhood in which Lee grew up became overcrowded, dangerous, andfull of gang rivalries due to an influx of refugees fleeing communist China forHong Kong, at that time a British Crown colony.After Lee was involved in several street fights, his parents decided that heneeded to be trained in the martial arts. Lee's first introduction to martialarts was through his father, from whom he learned the fundamentals of Wu-stylet'ai chi ch'uan.The largest influence on Lee's martial arts development was his study of WingChun. Lee began training in Wing Chun when he was 16 years old under the WingChun teacher Yip Man in 1957, after losing several fights with rival gangmembers. Yip's regular classes generally consisted of the forms practice, chisao (sticking hands) drills, wooden dummy techniques, and free-sparring. Therewas no set pattern to the classes. Yip tried to keep his students from fightingin the street gangs of Hong Kong by encouraging them to fight in organizedcompetitions.After a year into his Wing Chun training, most of Yip Man's other studentsrefused to train with Lee after they learned of his mixed ancestry, as theChinese were generally against teaching their martial arts techniques tonon-Asians. Lee's sparring partner, Hawkins Cheung states, \"Probably fewer thansix people in the whole Wing Chun clan were personally taught, or even partlytaught, by Yip Man\". However, Lee showed a keen interest in Wing Chun, andcontinued to train privately with Yip Man and Wong Shun Leung in 1955. Wan KamLeung, a student of Wong's, witnessed a sparring bout between Wong and Lee, andnoted the speed and precision with which Lee was able to deliver his kicks. Leecontinued to train with Wong Shun Leung after later returning to Hong Kong fromAmerica.After attending Tak Sun School ( several blocks from his home at 218 NathanRoad, Kowloon), Lee entered the primary school division of La Salle College atthe age of 12. In around 1956, due to poor academic performance (or possiblypoor conduct as well), he was transferred to St. Francis Xavier's College (highschool) where he would be mentored by Brother Edward, a teacher and coach of theschool boxing team.In the spring of 1959, Lee got into yet another street fight and the police werecalled. Until his late teens, Lee's street fights became more frequent andincluded beating the son of a feared triad family. Eventually, Lee's fatherdecided his son should leave Hong Kong to pursue a safer and healthier life inthe United States. His parents confirmed the police's fear that this time Lee'sopponent had an organised crime background, and there was the possibility that acontract was out for his life. In April 1959, Lee's parents decided to send himto the United States to stay with his older sister, Agnes Lee , who was alreadyliving with family friends in San Francisco.At the age of 18, Lee returned to the United States. After living in SanFrancisco for several months, he moved to Seattle in 1959, to continue his highschool education, where he also worked for Ruby Chow as a live-in waiter at herrestaurant.Chow's husband was a co-worker and friend of Lee's father. Lee's elder brotherPeter Lee would also join him in Seattle for a short stay before moving on toMinnesota to attend college. In December 1960, Lee completed his high schooleducation and received his diploma from Edison Technical School (now SeattleCentral Community College, located on Capitol Hill in Seattle).In March 1961, Lee enrolled at the University of Washington, majoring in dramaaccording to a 1999 article in the university's alumni magazine, not inphilosophy as stated by Lee himself and many others. Lee also studiedphilosophy, psychology, and various other subjects. It was at the University ofWashington that he met his future wife Linda Emery, a fellow student studying tobecome a teacher, whom he married in August 1964. Lee had two children withLinda Emery, Brandon Lee (1965–93) and Shannon Lee (born 1969)."},{"pageContent":"Martial arts careerLee began teaching martial arts in the United States in 1959. He called what hetaught Jun Fan Gung Fu (literally Bruce Lee's Kung Fu). It was basically hisapproach to Wing Chun. Lee taught friends he met in Seattle, starting with Judopractitioner Jesse Glover, who continued to teach some of Lee's earlytechniques. Taky Kimura became Lee's first Assistant Instructor and continued toteach his art and philosophy after Lee's death. Lee opened his first martialarts school, named the Lee Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute, in Seattle.Lee dropped out of college in the spring of 1964 and moved to Oakland to livewith James Yimm Lee . James Lee was twenty years senior to Bruce Lee and a wellknown Chinese martial artist in the area. Together, they founded the second JunFan martial art studio in Oakland. James Lee was also responsible forintroducing Bruce Lee to Ed Parker, American martial artist, and organizer ofthe Long Beach International Karate Championships at which Bruce Lee was later\"discovered\" by Hollywood.At the invitation of Ed Parker, Lee appeared in the 1964 Long BeachInternational Karate Championships and performed repetitions of two-fingerpush-ups (using the thumb and the index finger of one hand) with feet atapproximately a shoulder-width apart. In the same Long Beach event he alsoperformed the \"One inch punch.\" Lee stood upright, his right foot forward withknees bent slightly, in front of a standing, stationary partner. Lee's right armwas partly extended and his right fist approximately one inch (2.5 cm) away fromthe partner's chest. Without retracting his right arm, Lee then forciblydelivered the punch to his partner while largely maintaining his posture,sending the partner backwards and falling into a chair said to be placed behindthe partner to prevent injury, though his partner's momentum soon caused him tofall to the floor. His volunteer was Bob Baker of Stockton, California. \"I toldBruce not to do this type of demonstration again\", Baker recalled. \"When hepunched me that last time, I had to stay home from work because the pain in mychest was unbearable\".It was at the 1964 championships where Lee first met Taekwondo master Jhoon GooRhee. The two developed a friendship – a relationship from which they benefitedas martial artists. Rhee taught Lee the side kick in detail, and Lee taught Rheethe \"non-telegraphic\" punch.Lee appeared at the 1967 Long Beach International Karate Championships andperformed various demonstrations, including the famous \"unstoppable punch\"against USKA world Karate champion Vic Moore. Lee allegedly told Moore that hewas going to throw a straight punch to the face, and all he had to do was to tryto block it. Lee took several steps back and asked if Moore was ready. WhenMoore nodded in affirmation, Lee glided towards him until he was within strikingrange. He then threw a straight punch directly at Moore's face, and stoppedbefore impact. In eight attempts, Moore failed to block any of the punches.However, Moore and grandmaster Steve Mohammed claim that Lee had first toldMoore that he was going to throw a straight punch to the body, which Mooreblocked. Lee attempted another punch, and Moore blocked it as well. The thirdpunch, which Lee threw to Moore's face, did not come nearly within strikingdistance. Moore claims that Lee never successfully struck Moore but Moore wasable to strike Lee after trying on his own; Moore further claims that Bruce Leesaid he was the fastest American he's ever seen and that Lee's media crewrepeatedly played the one punch towards Moore's face that did not come withinstriking range, allegedly in an attempt to preserve Lee's superstar image.In Oakland, California in 1964 at Chinatown, Lee had a controversial privatematch with Wong Jack Man, a direct student of Ma Kin Fung known for his masteryof Xingyiquan, Northern Shaolin, and T'ai chi ch'uan. According to Lee, theChinese community issued an ultimatum to him to stop teaching non-Chinese. Whenhe refused to comply, he was challenged to a combat match with Wong. Thearrangement was that if Lee lost, he would have to shut down his school; whileif he won, then Lee would be free to teach Caucasians or anyone else. Wongdenied this, stating that he requested to fight Lee after Lee boasted during oneof his demonstrations at a Chinatown theatre that he could beat anyone in SanFrancisco, and that Wong himself did not discriminate against Caucasians orother non-Chinese. Lee commented, \"That paper had all the names of the sifu fromChinatown, but they don't scare me\".Individuals known to have witnessed the match include Cadwell, James Lee (BruceLee's associate, no relation), and William Chen, a teacher of T'ai chi ch'uan.Wong and William Chen stated that the fight lasted an unusually long 20–25minutes. Wong claims that he had originally expected a serious but polite bout;however Lee had attacked him very aggressively with intent to kill, straightfrom the beginning of the bout when he had replied to Wong's traditionalhandshake offer by pretending to accept the handshake, but instead turning thathand into a spear aimed at Wong's eyes. Forced to defend his life, he hadnonetheless refrained from striking Lee with killing force when the opportunitypresented itself because it could earn him a prison sentence. The fight endeddue to Lee's \"unusually winded\" condition, as opposed to a decisive blow byeither fighter. According to Bruce Lee, Linda Lee Cadwell, and James Yimm Leehowever, the fight lasted a mere 3 minutes with a decisive victory for Lee. InCadwell's account, \"The fight ensued, it was a no-holds-barred fight, it tookthree minutes. Bruce got this guy down to the ground and said 'Do you give up?'and the man said he gave up\".A couple of weeks after the bout, Lee gave an interview claiming that he haddefeated an unnamed challenger, which Wong says was an obvious reference to him.In response, Wong published his own account of the fight in the Chinese PacificWeekly, a Chinese-language newspaper in San Francisco, with an invitation to apublic rematch if Lee was not satisfied with the account. Lee did not respond tothe invitation despite his reputation for violently responding to everyprovocation, and there were no further public announcements by either, thoughLee continued to teach Caucasians.Jeet Kune DoJeet Kune Do originated in 1967. After filming one season of The Green Hornet,Lee found himself out of work and opened The Jun Fan Institute of Gung Fu. Thecontroversial match with Wong Jack Man influenced Lee's philosophy about martialarts. Lee concluded that the fight had lasted too long and that he had failed tolive up to his potential using his Wing Chun techniques. He took the view thattraditional martial arts techniques were too rigid and formalistic to bepractical in scenarios of chaotic street fighting. Lee decided to develop asystem with an emphasis on \"practicality, flexibility, speed, and efficiency\".He started to use different methods of training such as weight training forstrength, running for endurance, stretching for flexibility, and many otherswhich he constantly adapted, including fencing and basic boxing techniques.Lee emphasised what he called \"the style of no style\". This consisted of gettingrid of the formalised approach which Lee claimed was indicative of traditionalstyles. Lee felt the system he now called Jun Fan Gung Fu was even toorestrictive, and eventually evolved into a philosophy and martial art he wouldcome to call Jeet Kune Do or the Way of the Intercepting Fist. It is a term hewould later regret, because Jeet Kune Do implied specific parameters that stylesconnote; whereas the idea of his martial art was to exist outside of parametersand limitations.Originally, when Lee began researching various fighting styles, he called it JunFan Gung Fu. Not wanting to create another style which would share thelimitations that all styles had, he instead described the process which he usedto create it:I have not invented a \"new style,\" composite, modified or otherwise that is setwithin distinct form as apart from \"this\" method or \"that\" method. On thecontrary, I hope to free my followers from clinging to styles, patterns, ormolds. Remember that Jeet Kune Do is merely a name used, a mirror in which tosee \"ourselves\". Jeet Kune Do is not an organized institution that one can be amember of. Either you understand or you don't, and that is that. There is nomystery about my style. My movements are simple, direct and non-classical. Theextraordinary part of it lies in its simplicity. Every movement in Jeet Kune Dois being so of itself. There is nothing artificial about it. I always believethat the easy way is the right way. Jeet Kune Do is simply the direct expressionof one's feelings with the minimum of movements and energy. The closer to thetrue way of Kung Fu, the less wastage of expression there is. Finally, a JeetKune Do man who says Jeet Kune Do is exclusively Jeet Kune Do is simply not withit. He is still hung up on his self-closing resistance, in this case anchoreddown to reactionary pattern, and naturally is still bound by another modifiedpattern and can move within its limits. He has not digested the simple fact thattruth exists outside all molds; pattern and awareness is never exclusive. Againlet me remind you Jeet Kune Do is just a name used, a boat to get one across,and once across it is to be discarded and not to be carried on one's back.—Bruce LeeThe following are principles that Lee incorporated into Jeet Kune Do. Lee feltthese were universal combat truths that were self-evident, and would lead tocombat success if followed. Familiarity with each of the \"Four ranges ofcombat\", in particular, is thought to be instrumental in becoming a \"total\"martial artist. JKD teaches that the best defense is a strong offense, hence theprinciple of an \"intercepting fist\". For someone to attack another hand-to-hand,the attacker must approach the target. This provides an opportunity for theattacked person to \"intercept\" the attacking movement. The principle ofinterception may be applied to more than intercepting physical attacks;non-verbal cues (subtle movements that an opponent may be unaware of) may alsobe perceived or \"intercepted\", and thus be used to one's advantage. The \"Fiveways of attack\", categories which help JKD practitioners organize their fightingrepertoire, comprise the offensive teachings of JKD. The concepts of \"Stop hits& stop kicks\", and \"Simultaneous parrying & punching\", based on the concept ofsingle fluid motions which attack while defending (in systems such as Épéefencing and Wing Chun), compose the defensive teachings of JKD. These conceptswere modified for unarmed combat and implemented into the JKD framework by Leeto complement the principle of interception.Straight leadLee felt that the straight lead was the most integral part of Jeet Kune Dopunching, as he stated, \"The leading straight punch is the backbone of allpunching in Jeet Kune Do.\" The straight lead is not a power strike but a strikeformulated for speed. The straight lead should always be held loosely with aslight motion, as this adds to its speed and makes it more difficult to see andblock. The strike is not only the fastest punch in JKD, but also the mostaccurate. The speed is attributed to the fact that the fist is held out slightlymaking it closer to the target and its accuracy is gained from the punch beingthrown straight forward from one's centerline. The straight lead should be heldand thrown loosely and easily, tightening only upon impact, adding to one'spunch. The straight lead punch can be thrown from multiple angles and levels.Non-telegraphed punchLee felt that explosive attacks with no telegraphing signs of intention werebest. He argued that the attacks should catch the opponent off-guard, throwingthem off their balance and leaving them unable to defend against furtherattacks. \"The concept behind this is that when you initiate your punch withoutany forewarning, such as tensing your shoulders or moving your foot or body, theopponent will not have enough time to react,\" Lee wrote. The key is that onemust keep one's body and arms loose, weaving one's arms slightly and onlybecoming tense upon impact. Lee wanted no wind-up movements or \"get ready poses\"to prelude any JKD attacks. Lee explained that any twitches or slight movementsbefore striking should be avoided as they will give the opponent signs or hintsas to what is being planned and then they will be able to strike first while oneis preparing an attack. Consequently, non-telegraphed movement is an essentialpart of Jeet Kune Do philosophy.\"Be Like Water\"Lee emphasized that every situation, in fighting or in everyday life, is varied.To obtain victory, therefore, it is essential not to be rigid, but to be fluidand able to adapt to any situation. He compared it to being like water: \"Emptyyour mind, be formless, shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, itbecomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You putit in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow, or it can crash. Bewater, my friend.\" Lee's theory behind this was that one must be able tofunction in any scenario one is thrown into and should react accordingly. Oneshould know when to speed up or slow down, when to expand and when to contract,and when to remain flowing and when to crash. It is the awareness that both lifeand fighting can be shapeless and ever changing that allows one to be able toadapt to those changes instantaneously and bring forth the appropriate solution.Lee did not believe in \"styles\" and felt that every person and every situationis different and not everyone fits into a mold; one must remain flexible inorder to obtain new knowledge and victory in both life and combat. One mustnever become stagnant in the mind or method, always evolving and moving towardsimproving oneself.Economy of motionJeet Kune Do seeks to waste no time or movement, teaching that the simplestthings work best, as in Wing Chun. Economy of motion is the principle by whichJKD practitioners achieve:Efficiency: An attack which reaches its target in the least amount of time, withmaximum force.Directness: Doing what comes naturally in a disciplined way.Simplicity: Thinking in an uncomplicated manner; without ornamentation.This is meant to help a practitioner conserve both energy and time, two crucialcomponents in a physical confrontation. Maximized force seeks to end the battlequickly due to the amount of damage inflicted upon the opponent. Rapidity aimsto reach the target before the opponent can react, which is half-beat fastertiming, as taught in Wing Chun and Western boxing. Learned techniques areutilized in JKD to apply these principles to a variety of situations.Stop Hits\"When the distance is wide, the attacking opponent requires some sort ofpreparation. Therefore, attack him on his preparation of attack.\" \"To reach me,you must move to me. Your attack offers me an opportunity to intercept you.\"This means intercepting an opponent's attack with an attack of one's own insteadof simply blocking it. It is for this concept Jeet Kune Do is named. JKDpractitioners believe that this is the most difficult defensive skill todevelop. This strategy is a feature of some traditional Chinese martial arts asWing Chun, as well as an essential component of European Épée Fencing. Stop hitsand kicks utilize the principle of economy of motion by combining attack anddefense into one movement, thus minimizing the \"time\" element.Simultaneous parrying and punchingWhen confronting an incoming attack, the attack is parried or deflected, and acounterattack is delivered at the same time. This is not as advanced as a stophit but more effective than blocking and counterattacking in sequence. This ispracticed by some Chinese martial arts such as Wing Chun, and it is also knownin Krav Maga as \"bursting\". Simultaneous parrying & punching utilizes theprinciple of economy of motion by combining attack and defense into onemovement, thus minimizing the \"time\" element and maximising the \"energy\"element. Efficiency is gained by utilizing a parry rather than a block. Bydefinition a \"block\" stops an attack, whereas a parry merely re-directs it.Redirection has two advantages, first that it requires less energy to executeand second that it utilizes the opponent's energy against them by creating animbalance. Efficiency is gained in that the opponent has less time to react toan incoming attack, since they are still nullifying the original attack.Low kicksJKD practitioners believe they should direct their kicks to their opponent'sshins, knees, thighs, and midsection, as in Wing Chun. These targets are theclosest to the foot, provide more stability and are more difficult to defendagainst. Maintaining low kicks utilizes the principle of economy of motion byreducing the distance a kick must travel, thus minimizing the \"time\" element.However, as with all other JKD principles nothing is \"written in stone\". If atarget of opportunity presents itself, even a target above the waist, one couldtake advantage and not be hampered by this principle.Four ranges of combat•Punching•Kicking•Trapping•GrapplingJeet Kune Do students train in each of the aforementioned ranges equally.According to Lee, this range of training serves to differentiate JKD from othermartial arts. Lee stated that most but not all traditional martial arts systemsspecialize in training at one or two ranges. Lee's theories have been especiallyinfluential and substantiated in the field of mixed martial arts, as the MMAPhases of Combat are essentially the same concept as the JKD combat ranges. As ahistoric note, the ranges in JKD have evolved over time. Initially the rangeswere categorized as short or close, medium, and long range. These terms provedambiguous and eventually evolved into their more descriptive forms, althoughsome may still prefer the original three categories.Five ways of attackThe original five ways of attack are:•Simple Direct Attack (SDA)•Attack By Combination (ABC)•Progressive Indirect Attack (PIA)•(Hand) Immobilization Attack (HIA)•Attack By Drawing (ABD)CenterlineThe centerline is an imaginary line drawn vertically along the center of astanding human body, and refers to the space directly in front of that body. Ifone draws an isosceles triangle on the floor, for which one's body forms thebase, and one's arms form the equal legs of the triangle, then h (the height ofthe triangle) is the centerline. The Wing Chun concept is to exploit, controland dominate an opponent's centerline. All attacks, defenses, and footwork aredesigned to guard one's own centerline while entering the opponent's centerlinespace. Lee incorporated this theory into JKD from his Sifu Yip Man's Wing Chun.The three guidelines for centerline are:•The one who controls the centerline will control the fight.•Protect and maintain your own centerline while you control and exploit youropponent's.•Control the centerline by occupying it.This notion is closely related to maintaining control of the center squares inthe strategic game chess. The concept is naturally present in xiangqi (Chinesechess), where an \"X\" is drawn on the game board, in front of both players'general and advisors.Combat realismOne of the premises that Lee incorporated in Jeet Kune Do was \"combat realism\".He insisted that martial arts techniques should be incorporated based upon theireffectiveness in real combat situations. This would differentiate JKD from othersystems where there was an emphasis on \"flowery technique\", as Lee would put it.Lee claimed that flashy \"flowery techniques\" would arguably \"look good\" but wereoften not practical or would prove ineffective in street survival andself-defense situations. This premise would differentiate JKD from other\"sport\"-oriented martial arts systems that were geared towards \"tournament\" or\"point systems\". Lee felt that these systems were \"artificial\" and fooled theirpractitioners into a false sense of true martial skill. Lee felt that becausethese systems favored a \"sports\" approach they incorporated too many rule setsthat would ultimately handicap a practitioner in self-defense situations. Hefelt that this approach to martial arts became a \"game of tag\" which would leadto bad habits such as pulling punches and other attacks; this would again leadto disastrous consequences in real world situations.Another aspect of realistic martial arts training fundamental to JKD is what Leereferred to as \"aliveness\". This is the concept of training techniques with anunwilling assistant who offers resistance. Lee made a reference to this conceptin his famous quote \"Boards don't hit back!\" Because of this perspective ofrealism and aliveness, Lee utilized safety gear from various other contactsports to allow him to spar with opponents \"full out\". This approach to trainingallowed practitioners to come as close as possible to real combat situationswith a high degree of safety.Fitness and nutritionAt 173 cm (5 ft 8 in) and 64 kg (141 lb), Lee was renowned for his physicalfitness and vigor, achieved by using a dedicated fitness regimen to become asstrong as possible. After his match with Wong Jack Man in 1965, Lee changed hisapproach toward martial arts training. Lee felt that many martial artists of histime did not spend enough time on physical conditioning. Lee included allelements of total fitness—muscular strength, muscular endurance, cardiovascularendurance, and flexibility. He used traditional bodybuilding techniques to buildsome muscle mass, not overdone as that could decrease speed or flexibility. Atthe same time in balance, Lee maintained that mental and spiritual preparationare fundamental to the success of physical training in martial arts skills. InTao of Jeet Kune Do he wrote,Training is one of the most neglected phases of athletics. Too much time isgiven to the development of skill and too little to the development of theindividual for participation. JKD, ultimately is not a matter of pettytechniques but of highly developed spirituality and physique.According to Linda Lee Cadwell, soon after he moved to the United States, Leestarted to take nutrition seriously and developed an interest in health foods,high-protein drinks and vitamin and mineral supplements. He later concluded thatin order to achieve a high-performance body, one could not fuel it with a dietof junk food, and with \"the wrong fuel\" one's body would perform sluggishly orsloppily. Lee also avoided baked goods and refined flour, describing them asproviding calories which did nothing for his body."},{"pageContent":"Acting CareerLee's father Lee Hoi-chuen was a famous Cantonese opera star. Because of this,Lee was introduced into films at a very young age and appeared in several filmsas a child. Lee had his first role as a baby who was carried onto the stage inthe film Golden Gate Girl. By the time he was 18, he had appeared in twentyfilms.While in the United States from 1959 to 1964, Lee abandoned thoughts of a filmcareer in favour of pursuing martial arts. However, a martial arts exhibition onLong Beach in 1964 eventually led to the invitation by William Dozier for anaudition for a part in the pilot for \"Number One Son\". The show never aired, butLee was invited for the role of Kato alongside Van Williams in the TV series TheGreen Hornet. The show lasted just one season, from 1966 to 1967. Lee alsoplayed Kato in three crossover episodes of Batman. This was followed by guestappearances in three television series: Ironside (1967), Here Come the Brides(1969), and Blondie (1969).At the time, two of Lee's martial arts students were Hollywood script writerStirling Silliphant and actor James Coburn. In 1969 the three worked on a scriptfor a film called The Silent Flute, and went together on a location hunt toIndia. The project was not realised at the time; but the 1978 film Circle ofIron, starring David Carradine, was based on the same plot. In 2010, producerPaul Maslansky was reported to plan and receive fundings for a film based on theoriginal script for The Silent Flute. In 1969, Lee made a brief appearance inthe Silliphant-penned film Marlowe where he played a henchman hired tointimidate private detective Philip Marlowe, (played by James Garner), bysmashing up his office with leaping kicks and flashing punches, only to lateraccidentally jump off a tall building while trying to kick Marlowe off. The sameyear he also choreographed fight scenes for The Wrecking Crew starring DeanMartin, Sharon Tate, and featuring Chuck Norris in his first role. In 1970, hewas responsible for fight choreography for A Walk in the Spring Rain starringIngrid Bergman and Anthony Quinn, again written by Silliphant. In 1971, Leeappeared in four episodes of the television series Longstreet, written bySilliphant. Lee played the martial arts instructor of the title character MikeLongstreet (played by James Franciscus), and important aspects of his martialarts philosophy were written into the script.According to statements made by Lee, and also by Linda Lee Cadwell after Lee'sdeath, in 1971 Lee pitched a television series of his own tentatively titled TheWarrior, discussions which were also confirmed by Warner Bros. In a December 9,1971 television interview on The Pierre Berton Show, Lee stated that bothParamount and Warner Brothers wanted him \"to be in a modernized type of a thing,and that they think the Western idea is out, whereas I want to do the Western\".According to Cadwell, however, Lee's concept was retooled and renamed Kung Fu,but Warner Bros. gave Lee no credit. Warner Brothers states that they had forsome time been developing an identical concept, created by two writers andproducers, Ed Spielman and Howard Friedlander. According to these sources, thereason Lee was not cast was in part because of his ethnicity, but more sobecause he had a thick accent. The role of the Shaolin monk in the Wild West,was eventually awarded to then-non-martial-artist David Carradine. In The PierreBerton Show interview, Lee stated he understood Warner Brothers' attitudestowards casting in the series: \"They think that business wise it is a risk. Idon't blame them. If the situation were reversed, and an American star were tocome to Hong Kong, and I was the man with the money, I would have my ownconcerns as to whether the acceptance would be there\".Hong Kong films and stardomProducer Fred Weintraub had advised Lee to return to Hong Kong and make afeature film which he could showcase to executives in Hollywood. Not happy withhis supporting roles in the US, Lee returned to Hong Kong. Unaware that TheGreen Hornet had been played to success in Hong Kong and was unofficiallyreferred to as \"The Kato Show\", he was surprised to be recognised on the streetas the star of the show. After negotiating with both Shaw Brothers Studio andGolden Harvest, Lee signed a film contract to star in two films produced byGolden Harvest.Lee played his first leading role in The Big Boss (1971) which proved to be anenormous box office success across Asia and catapulted him to stardom. He soonfollowed up with Fist of Fury (1972) which broke the box office records setpreviously by The Big Boss. Having finished his initial two-year contract, Leenegotiated a new deal with Golden Harvest. Lee later formed his own company,Concord Production Inc., with Chow. For his third film, Way of the Dragon(1972), he was given complete control of the film's production as the writer,director, star, and choreographer of the fight scenes. In 1964, at ademonstration in Long Beach, California, Lee had met Karate champion ChuckNorris. In Way of the Dragon Lee introduced Norris to movie-goers as hisopponent in the final death fight at the Colosseum in Rome, today considered oneof Lee's most legendary fight scenes and one of the most memorable fight scenesin martial arts film history. The role was originally offered to American Karatechampion Joe Lewis.From August to October 1972, Lee began work on his fourth Golden Harvest Film,Game of Death. He began filming some scenes including his fight sequence with 7ft 2 in (218 cm) American Basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, a former student.Production was stopped in November 1972 when Warner Brothers offered Lee theopportunity to star in Enter the Dragon, the first film to be produced jointlyby Golden Harvest and Warner Bros. Filming began in Hong Kong in January 1973.One month into the filming, another production company, Starseas MotionPictures, promoted Bruce Lee as a leading actor in Fist of Unicorn, although hehad merely agreed to choreograph the fight sequences in the film as a favour tohis long-time friend Unicorn Chan. Lee planned to sue the production company,but retained his friendship with Chan. However, only a few months after thecompletion of Enter the Dragon, and six days before its July 26, 1973 release,Lee died. Enter the Dragon would go on to become one of the year'shighest-grossing films and cement Lee as a martial arts legend. It was made forUS$850,000 in 1973 (equivalent to $4 million adjusted for inflation as of 2007).To date, Enter the Dragon has grossed over $200 million worldwide. The filmsparked a brief fad in martial arts, epitomised in songs such as \"Kung FuFighting\" and TV shows like Kung Fu.Robert Clouse, the director of Enter the Dragon and Golden Harvest revived Lee'sunfinished film Game of Death. Lee had shot over 100 minutes of footage,including out-takes, for Game of Death before shooting was stopped to allow himto work on Enter the Dragon. In addition to Abdul-Jabbar, George Lazenby,Hapkido master Ji Han-Jae and another of Lee's students, Dan Inosanto, were alsoto appear in the film, which was to culminate in Lee's character, Hai Tien (cladin the now-famous yellow track suit) taking on a series of different challengerson each floor as they make their way through a five-level pagoda. In acontroversial move, Robert Clouse finished the film using a look-alike andarchive footage of Lee from his other films with a new storyline and cast, whichwas released in 1978. However, the cobbled-together film contained only fifteenminutes of actual footage of Lee (he had printed many unsuccessful takes) whilethe rest had a Lee look-alike, Kim Tai Chung, and Yuen Biao as stunt double. Theunused footage Lee had filmed was recovered 22 years later and included in thedocumentary Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey.Apart from Game of Death, other future film projects were planned to feature Leeat the time. In 1972, after the success of The Big Boss and Fist of Fury, athird film was planned by Raymond Chow at Golden Harvest to be directed by LoWei, titled Yellow-Faced Tiger. However, at the time, Lee decided to direct andproduce his own script for Way of the Dragon instead. Although Lee had formed aproduction company with Raymond Chow, a period film was also planned fromSeptember–November 1973 with the competing Shaw Brothers Studio, to be directedby either Chor Yuen or Cheng Kang, and written by Yi Kang and Chang Cheh, titledThe Seven Sons of the Jade Dragon. Lee had also worked on several scriptshimself. A tape containing a recording of Lee narrating the basic storyline to afilm tentatively titled Southern Fist/Northern Leg exists, showing somesimilarities with the canned script for The Silent Flute (Circle of Iron).Another script had the title Green Bamboo Warrior, set in San Francisco, plannedto co-star Bolo Yeung and to be produced by Andrew Vajna who later went on toproduce First Blood. Photo shoot costume tests were also organized for some ofthese planned film projects.PhilosophyLee is best known as a martial artist, but he also studied drama and Asian andWestern philosophy while a student at the University of Washington andthroughout his life. He was well-read and had an extensive library dominated bymartial arts subjects and philosophical texts. His own books on martial arts andfighting philosophy are known for their philosophical assertions, both insideand outside of martial arts circles. His eclectic philosophy often mirrored hisfighting beliefs, though he was quick to claim that his martial arts were solelya metaphor for such teachings. He believed that any knowledge ultimately led toself-knowledge, and said that his chosen method of self-expression was martialarts. His influences include Taoism, Jiddu Krishnamurti, and Buddhism. On theother hand, Lee's philosophy was very much in opposition to the conservativeworldview advocated by Confucianism. John Little states that Lee was an atheist.When asked in 1972 about his religious affiliation, he replied, \"nonewhatsoever\". In 1972, he was asked if he believed in God, and responded, \"To beperfectly frank, I really do not\".PoetryAside from martial arts and philosophy which focus on the physical aspect andself-consciousness for truths and principles, Lee also wrote poetry thatreflected his emotion and a stage in his life collectively. Many forms of artremain concordant with the artist creating them. Lee's principal ofself-expression was applied to his poetry as well. His daughter Shannon Lee said\"He did write poetry, he was really the consummate artist\". His poetic worksoriginally handwritten on paper, later on edited and published. John Littlebeing the major author (editor), for Bruce Lee's works. Linda Lee Cadwell (BruceLee's wife) shared her husbands notes, poems and experiences with followers. Shementioned \"Lee's poems are, by American standards, rather dark-reflecting thedeeper, less exposed recesses of the human psyche\". Most of Bruce Lee's poemsare categorized as anti-poetry or fall into a paradox. The mood in his poemsshow the side of the man that can be compared with other poets such as RobertFrost, one of many well-known poets expressing himself with dark poetic works.The paradox taken from the Yin and Yang symbol in martial arts, also integratedin his poetry. His martial arts, and philosophy contribute a great part to hispoetry. The free verse form of Lee's poetry reflects his famous quote \"Beformless ... shapeless, like water.\""},{"pageContent":"Death and LegacyOn May 10, 1973, Lee collapsed during an ADR session for Enter the Dragon atGolden Harvest in Hong Kong. Suffering from seizures and headaches, he wasimmediately rushed to Hong Kong Baptist Hospital where doctors diagnosedcerebral edema. They were able to reduce the swelling through the administrationof mannitol. The headache and cerebral edema that occurred in his first collapsewere later repeated on the day of his death.On July 20, 1973, Lee was in Hong Kong, to have dinner with James Bond starGeorge Lazenby, with whom he intended to make a film. According to Lee's wifeLinda, Lee met producer Raymond Chow at 2 p.m. at home to discuss the making ofthe film Game of Death. They worked until 4 p.m. and then drove together to thehome of Lee's colleague Betty Ting Pei, a Taiwanese actress. The three went overthe script at Ting's home, and then Chow left to attend a dinner meeting.Later Lee complained of a headache, and Ting gave him an analgesic (painkiller),Equagesic, which contained both aspirin and the tranquilizer meprobamate. Around7:30 p.m., he went to lie down for a nap. When Lee did not turn up for dinner,producer Raymond Chow came to the apartment, but was unable to wake Lee up. Adoctor was summoned, who spent ten minutes attempting to revive Lee beforesending him by ambulance to Queen Elizabeth Hospital. By the time the ambulancereached the hospital he was dead. He was 32 years old.There was no visible external injury; however, according to autopsy reports,Lee's brain had swollen considerably, from 1,400 to 1,575 grams (a 13%increase). The autopsy found Equagesic in his system. On October 15, 2005, Chowstated in an interview that Lee died from an allergic reaction to thetranquilizer meprobamate, the main ingredient in Equagesic, which Chow describedas an ingredient commonly used in painkillers. When the doctors announced Lee'sdeath officially, it was ruled a \"death by misadventure\".Lee's wife Linda returned to her hometown of Seattle, and had him buried at lot276 of Lakeview Cemetery. Pallbearers at his funeral on July 25, 1973 includedTaky Kimura, Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Chuck Norris, George Lazenby, DanInosanto, Peter Chin, and Lee's brother Robert.Controversy surrounding Lee's deathAround the time of Lee's death, numerous rumors appeared in the media. Lee'siconic status and untimely demise fed many wild rumors and theories. Theseincluded murder involving the Triads and a supposed curse on him and his family.Donald Teare, a forensic scientist recommended by Scotland Yard who had overseenover 1,000 autopsies, was assigned to the Lee case. His conclusion was \"death bymisadventure\" caused by an acute cerebral edema due to a reaction to compoundspresent in the combination medication Equagesic.While there was initial speculation that cannabis found in Lee's stomach mayhave contributed to his death, Teare refuted this, stating that it would \"beboth 'irresponsible and irrational' to say that might have triggered either theevents of Bruce's collapse on May 10 or his death on July 20\". Dr. R. R.Lycette, the clinical pathologist at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, reported at thecoroner hearing that the death could not have been caused by cannabis.At the 1975 San Diego Comic-Con convention, Bruce Lee's friend Chuck Norrisattributed his death to a reaction between the muscle-relaxant medication he hadbeen taking since 1968 for a ruptured disc in his back, and an \"antibiotic\" hewas given for his headache on the night of his death.Certified instructorsBruce Lee personally certified only three instructors: Taky Kimura, James YimmLee, and Dan Inosanto. Inosanto holds the 3rd rank (Instructor) directly fromBruce Lee in Jeet Kune Do, Jun Fan Gung Fu, and Bruce Lee's Tao of Chinese GungFu. Taky Kimura holds a 5th rank in Jun Fan Gung Fu. James Yimm Lee held a 3rdrank in Jun Fan Gung Fu. Ted Wong holds 2nd rank in Jeet Kune Do certifieddirectly by Bruce Lee and was later promoted to Instructor under Dan Inosanto,who felt that Bruce would have wanted to promote him. Other Jeet Kune Doinstructors since Lee's death have been certified directly by Dan Inosanto, somewith remaining Bruce Lee signed certificates.James Yimm Lee, a close friend of Lee, certified a few students including GaryDill who studied Jeet Kune Do under James and received permission via a personalletter from him in 1972 to pass on his learning of Jun Fan Gung Fu to others.Taky Kimura, to date, has certified only one person in Jun Fan Gung Fu: his sonAndy Kimura. Dan Inosanto continued to teach and certify select students in JeetKune Do for over 30 years, making it possible for thousands of martial artspractitioners to trace their training lineage back to Bruce Lee. Prior to hisdeath, Lee told his then only two living instructors Kimura and Inosanto (JamesYimm Lee had died in 1972) to dismantle his schools.Both Taky Kimura and Dan Inosanto were allowed to teach small classesthereafter, under the guideline \"keep the numbers low, but the quality high\".Bruce also instructed several World Karate Champions including Chuck Norris, JoeLewis, and Mike Stone. Between the three of them, during their training withBruce, they won every karate championship in the United States. In Japan,Junichi Okada is a certified Japanese instructor in Jeet Kune Do.There are a number of stories (perhaps apocryphal) surrounding Lee that arestill repeated in Hong Kong culture. One is that his early 1970s interview onthe TVB show Enjoy Yourself Tonight cleared the busy streets of Hong Kong aseveryone was watching the interview at home.On January 6, 2009, it was announced that Bruce's Hong Kong home (41 CumberlandRoad, Kowloon, Hong Kong) will be preserved and transformed into a tourist siteby philanthropist Yu Pang-lin."},{"pageContent":"Awards and honours•Lee was named among TIME Magazine's 100 Most Important People of the Century asone of the greatest heroes & icons, as an example of personal improvementthrough, in part, physical fitness, and among the most influential martialartists of the twentieth century.•With his ancestral roots coming from Gwan'on in Seundak, Guangdong province ofChina (, Guangdong Shunde Jun'An), a street in the village is named after himwhere his ancestral home is situated.
