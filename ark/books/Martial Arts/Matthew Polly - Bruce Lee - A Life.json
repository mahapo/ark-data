Asthe appointed hour of 10 a.m. drew closer, their numbers swelled and multiplieduntil over fifteen thousand Hong Kong residents stood behind police barricades,looked down from balconies, or perched precariously on the city’s famous neonsigns to catch a final glimpse of their idol’s coffin. Five days earlier BruceLee had died at the age of thirty-two. Several hundred extra police officerswere detailed to control the crowd. Wearing lime green shorts and short-sleevedshirts, black shoes, knee socks, and billed caps, the cops looked like overgrownBoy Scouts on a summer trip.The South China Morning Post described the scene as “a carnival.” When the crowdspotted one of Bruce’s celebrity friends entering the funeral home, they clappedand cheered. Wearing sunglasses to hide tears, the famous arrived one afteranother to pay their respects to the man who had put Hong Kong cinema on theworld map: Shih Kien, the villain in Enter the Dragon; Nancy Kwan, the star ofThe World of Suzie Wong; Nora Miao, Lee’s longtime costar; pop singer SamuelHui, a childhood friend; even Lo Wei, who directed two of Bruce’s films. One ofthe few famous faces to skip the event was Betty Ting Pei in whose apartment Leehad died. Much to the disappointment of the throng, Betty chose to stay homewhere she was reported to be under heavy sedation. She sent a wreath insteadwith a note, “To Bruce from Ting Pei.” Next to it a tearful six-year-old boydropped a spray of flowers with a simple message, “From a little fan.”“For the scores of fans who had stayed the night, the saddest moment was thearrival of Lee’s wife Linda,” reported The China Mail. A black Mercedes pulledto the curb, and Raymond Chow, Bruce’s business partner and the head of GoldenHarvest studios, opened Linda’s door and gave her a hand. Linda was dressed inall white—the Chinese color for mourning—a white double-breasted long coat downto her knees, white slacks, and a white turtleneck. Her light brown hair was cutshort. Big round sunglasses covered her red eyes. She appeared dangerously thinas if she hadn’t eaten for days. Leaning on Raymond’s arm, Linda was surroundedby a group of Golden Harvest employees who helped push her through the crowdsurrounding the front door. “Outside the crush was tremendous,” Linda latersaid. “I recalled the old newsreel shots of the funeral of Rudolph Valentino.”The five hundred VIP mourners inside the cramped funeral home fell silent as thetwenty-eight-year-old widow entered. At the front of the parlor was an altarwith a movie-poster-sized photo of Bruce wearing sunglasses surrounded by adisplay of ribbons, flowers, and a Chinese banner saying, “A Star Sinks in theSea of Art.”  Three joss sticks and two candles burned in front of his picture.The walls were covered with thousands of tributes—Chinese calligraphy on stripsof white silk.Raymond and Linda bowed before the altar three times before Chow escorted herover to the section reserved for family. Bruce’s older brother, Peter, and hiswife, Eunice Lam, stood solemnly. Linda was helped out of her fashionable longcoat and into a white, hooded, burlap mourning gown per Chinese custom. Her twochildren, eight-year-old Brandon and four-year-old Shannon, were brought in froma side entrance and dressed in white burlap as well. A white bandanna was tiedaround Brandon’s head. Shannon, too young to understand what was happening,played happily while Brandon glared angrily.A Chinese band struck up a traditional funeral song, which sounded like “AuldLang Syne.” Bruce’s HK$40,000 bronze casket was brought into the room. The tophalf of the coffin was opened. Inside was a protective enclosure of glasscovering Bruce’s body to prevent anyone from touching him. Linda had dressed herhusband in the blue Chinese outfit he had worn in Enter the Dragon and liked towear around the house because it was comfortable. Beneath the glass, Bruce’sface looked gray and distorted despite heavy makeup. Friends filed past the opencasket to see him one last time. Press photographers jostled with the invitedguests to get a better angle; many simply raised their cameras above their headsand snapped away furiously. As Linda made her way to her husband’s side, shelooked heartbreakingly close to collapse. Covering her face with a tremblinghand, Linda burst into tears. “It was a frightful time,” she later confessed tofriends.Seeing his hearse begin to depart, Bruce’s fans went wild with grief. Threehundred policemen surrounding the funeral parlor were forced to link arms andform a human chain to hold back the surging crowds. Eventually, reinforcementswere called as women and children were repeatedly plucked clear of the barrierto prevent them from being crushed. Old men wept, young girls fainted, and manypeople were hospitalized for shock and minor injuries. “It was terriblealright,” remembers Peter Lee. For hours afterward, police with loudspeakerswere still patrolling the streets urging people to return to their homes.Many mourners refused to leave because they knew this was the last time theywould be near their hero. The Hong Kong tabloids had angrily reported that Lindaplanned to bury her husband in America, making it nearly impossible for theaverage Chinese fan to visit his grave. Under the headline, “Lee’s Body Flies toAmerica Tomorrow,” the Oriental Daily wrote, “Linda has stuck to her gunsregarding several things about Lee’s death. She is obviously holding some kindof grudge. From the start, Linda wanted to ship Lee’s body back to America forautopsy, but due to legal restrictions, she relented. However, the body will besent to America for burial.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]In life, Bruce Lee sought to straddle East and West. In death, he only had onebody, and his Western widow had to pick a side. She chose her hometown. “Idecided to bury Bruce in the peace and calm of Seattle,” Linda explained. “Ithink his happiest times were spent in Seattle, and I intended to return therewith my children to live.” Seattle was where Linda had grown up, gone tocollege, and fallen in love with Bruce Lee.Her hometown had the added benefit of being a tranquil place for a funeral,unlike the mass mania of Hong Kong. In Asia, Bruce was bigger than the Beatles,but in America, Enter the Dragon had yet to be released. He was an obscure TVactor whose death garnered only a handful of short obituaries, several of whichcontained glaring errors. The Los Angeles Times wrote that Linda was his“Swedish-born” wife and in a shameful they-all-look-alike mistake added thatBruce was “the hero of such films as Five Fingers of Death.” (The popular ShawBros. kung fu movie actually starred Lieh Lo.) To ensure a serene Seattlefuneral, Linda sent a telegram to Warner Brothers executives, insisting on “aquiet and private service with no publicity.”Plane tickets that had been purchased by Warner Bros. to take Bruce and Linda toNew York for his guest appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carsonwere exchanged for the passage of Bruce’s body and the family to Seattle. OnThursday, July 26, Linda and the children went to Hong Kong’s Kai Tak Airportand boarded Northwest Orient Airlines Flight #4. Joining them were Andre Morgan,who, as the representative from Golden Harvest, was tasked with organizing andpaying for the funeral; Charles Loke, a Chinese cameraman, who was recording theevent for a documentary; and Rebu Hui, Linda’s best friend. “She kept me saneand I don’t know what I would have done without her,” says Linda. “I fell asleepimmediately on the plane and slept like an unconscious person—my brain hadfinally shut down.”While Bruce’s older brother, Peter, lived in Hong Kong, the rest of Bruce’simmediate family had followed him to America—his younger brother, Robert, hisolder sisters, Agnes and Phoebe, and his mother, Grace Ho. They were waiting inthe Seattle airport when Linda and the children arrived. Weeping, Grace grabbedLinda and refused to let go.Andre Morgan met with the funeral director of the Butterworth Mortuary on 300East Pine Street. They discussed which plot to buy at the Lake View Cemetery.“Do you want him buried with his kind?” the funeral director asked.“What does that mean?”The funeral director took a deep breath and looked left to right, right to leftbefore whispering, “We have a Chinese section.”“Oh really? Show me.”The Chinese cemetery was a small isolated area next to the equipment shed. TheCaucasian cemetery was, Morgan says, “as big as Arlington.” Andre opted for thelatter, picking out a location under big trees with a nice view of the mountain.“I bought two plots, side by side. One for Bruce, one for Linda,” Morganrecalls. “That afternoon I went and saw Linda at her mother’s home and said, ‘Ihope you don’t mind that I bought two plots.’ ”The funeral in Seattle was held on Monday, July 30, 1973. Unlike in Hong Kong,fewer than two dozen fans and only a couple of reporters were camped outside.Gathered inside were a hundred or so relatives, friends, and former students,including Jesse Glover. As an African American growing up in 1950s Seattle,Glover became obsessed with the martial arts but had difficulty finding anyonewilling to teach a black student. Bruce was the first kung fu teacher in Americato accept students regardless of race or ethnicity. For years, Jesse and Brucehad been as close as brothers. “I was unable to conceal the emotions that surgedto the surface,” Jesse says, “and I broke down and cried like a baby.”A contingent of Bruce’s Hollywood pals had flown up from Los Angeles—Ted Ashley,the chairman of Warner Bros., James Coburn, and Steve McQueen. Everyone wassurprised to see McQueen, who generally shunned funerals. “I cared about Bruce,”McQueen explained. “I felt like saying good-bye to a friend.”During the eulogies, Ted Ashley opined, “In 35 years in the movie-makingbusiness, I have never known anyone who wanted more and tried harder forperfection than Bruce. It could be viewed as a pity that Bruce passed on rightat the beginning of his realization that he would ‘make it big.’ I have a senseof sadness mingling with the realization that, while he may not have gotten upthat ladder, he at least got his foot on it.”Instead of traditional funeral music, Linda chose to play recordings of Bruce’sfavorite songs: Frank Sinatra’s “My Way,”  Tom Jones’s “The Impossible Dream,”and the Blood, Sweat, & Tears version of “And When I Die.” In her eulogy, Lindasaid that the lyrics of the last song spoke to Bruce’s philosophy: “When I dieand when I’m gone, there will be one child born in this world to carry on.”Looking considerably less shaken on her home territory, Linda went on to say,“Bruce believed the individual represents the whole of mankind whether he livesin the Orient or elsewhere. He believed man struggles to find the life outsidehimself, not realizing that the life he seeks is within him. The soul is anembryo of the body of man. The day of death is a day of awakening. The spiritlives on.” Adding her own view, she concluded, “When our day of awakening comes,we will meet him again.”After the service, the mourners made their way to Bruce’s open casket, coveredwith white, yellow, and red flowers making up the Taoist yin and yang symbol.“When I looked into the coffin and saw the pale imitation of what used to beBruce I felt a wild anger and the need to strike out at something,” Jesse Gloverrecalls.Bruce’s gravestone was hand-carved in Hong Kong and shipped over. Per Linda’sinstructions, the stonemason placed a photo of Bruce at the top and etchedbeneath it his name in English and Chinese characters and his birth and deathdates—Nov. 27, 1940–July 20, 1973. Linda also chose to have carved into thestone, “FOUNDER OF JEET KUNE DO.” At the base, the stonemason attached a marblecarving of an open book. On the left page was the Taoist yin and yang symbol; onthe right page were the words, “Your Inspiration Continues to Guide Us TowardsOur Personal Liberation.”The pallbearers were Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Bruce’s assistant Jeet Kune Doinstructors, Taky Kimura and Dan Inosanto, his younger brother, Robert Lee, andPeter Chin, a family friend from Los Angeles. At the gravesite, James Coburnstepped forward and spoke the last words: “Farewell, brother. It has been anhonor to share this space in time with you. As a friend and as a teacher, youhave brought my physical, spiritual, and psychological selves together. Thankyou. May peace be with you.”  Then he dropped the white gloves he had worn as apallbearer into the open grave and the others followed suit.Linda stood up and quickly thanked everyone for coming. Bruce’s mother, GraceHo, wearing a blue button coat and dark sunglasses, was so distraught with grieftwo relatives had to help her walk away. As the crowd thinned and the mournersreturned to their cars, the last person to remain was Jesse Glover. When theworkmen came to fill the grave, Jesse took one of their shovels and shooed themaway. It was a uniquely American moment—a black man in a suit with tears runningdown his face filling a Chinese grave in a white cemetery. Jesse says, “Itdidn’t seem right that Bruce should be covered by strange hands.”"},{"pageContent":"ACT ILITTLE DRAGON“Every talent must unfold itself in fighting.”—Friedrich Nietzsche"},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f0010-01.jpg]Bruce Lee’s parents, Grace Ho and Li Hoi Chuen, circa 1950s.

(David Tadman)"},{"pageContent":"ONESICK MAN OF ASIATen-year-old Li Hoi Chuen stood barefoot on the dirt road outside a corrugatedtin roof restaurant on the outskirts of Foshan City in southern China. He worethreadbare clothes passed down to him from his three older brothers. As urbanpedestrians wandered down the street, Hoi Chuen sang out in Cantonese therestaurant’s specials of the day: “Friends, countrymen, come, come, come and tryour fresh stewed beef brisket, water spinach with fermented tofu, frog legs onlotus leaf, congee with century egg, and sweet and sour pork.” His tender voicerose up and down with each menu item, a dancing falsetto. Among the hundreds ofpeasant boys employed by restaurants across the city to hawk their menus, therewas something special about the way Hoi Chuen sang—a wry, ironic undercurrent.On this particular day a famous Cantonese Opera singer passed by the restaurant,heard the humor in the young boy’s voice, and invited him to become hisapprentice. Bruce Lee’s father ran all the way back to his small village to tellhis parents the good news.The year was 1914. Revolutionary forces had recently overthrown the Qing Dynastyand established a constitutional republic, putting an end to four thousand yearsof imperial rule. The new government had a weak grip on power, various factionsvied for control, popular revolts had erupted in major cities, bandits roamedthe land, and the peasantry struggled to survive.The suffering was particularly intense in the Li household. Hoi Chuen was thefourth of six siblings. His father, Li Jun Biao, suffered so many ill turns offortune neighbors believed he was cursed. A severe fever in childhood damagedJun Biao’s throat to the point where he could barely speak, causing many toassume he was a deaf-mute. He struggled to find enough work to feed his family.Along with a part-time job as a security guard, he was also a fisherman. Heoften took his boys with him to catch supper.Hoi Chuen’s parents were overjoyed that their son would be apprenticed to anopera singer. It meant one less mouth to feed and a potential career for one oftheir children. On the appointed day, Hoi Chuen left his home to begin histraining—an incredibly brutal dawn-to-dusk regimen of acting, singing,acrobatics, and kung fu (also spelled “gung fu”) training. Unlike its more staidEuropean counterpart, Chinese Opera featured extravagant costumes, brightfull-face makeup, falsetto singing, Olympic-class gymnastics, and both weaponand empty-handed stage combat.After years of schooling, Li Hoi Chuen joined the senior actors on the stages ofFoshan. His specialty was comedic roles. In 1928, his opera troupe decided tomove sixty miles south to Hong Kong in search of larger and wealthier audiences.Ever loyal to his family, Hoi Chuen invited several of his brothers to join himin the British colony and helped them find jobs as waiters and busboys. HoiChuen was still supporting his acting career with part-time work in arestaurant.As Hoi Chuen and his opera troupe performed across the colony, their fame grewto the point where they were invited to give a private performance at thepalatial home called Idlewild, of Sir Robert Hotung Bosman, the richest man inHong Kong. It was here that Bruce’s father and mother, Li Hoi Chuen and GraceHo, first laid eyes on each other from across China’s economic, cultural, andracial divide. The maternal side of Bruce’s family was as wealthy andinfluential as his father’s was poor and powerless.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Grace Ho was a member of the Eurasian Bosman-Hotung clan—Hong Kong’s equivalentof the Rockefellers or the Kennedys. Her grandfather was Charles Henri MauriceBosman. Although many have thought Bosman was German Catholic, Bruce Lee’sgreat-grandfather was actually Dutch-Jewish. He was born Mozes Hartog Bosman inRotterdam on August 29, 1839.Mozes joined the Dutch East Asia Company as a teenager and arrived in Hong Kongin 1859. His fortune was made in the coolie trade. He shipped Chinese peasantlaborers to Dutch Guiana to work the sugar plantations after African slavery wasabolished and to California to build the Central Pacific Railroad. His businesssuccess led him to be appointed the Dutch consul to Hong Kong in 1866. Given theanti-Semitism of the time, all of his letters to the Netherlands minister offoreign affairs were signed “M Bosman.”Soon after his arrival in Hong Kong, Bosman purchased a Chinese concubine namedSze Tai. The teenage girl had grown up on Chongming Island, Shanghai, in a goodfamily, as evidenced by her bound feet. (Girls from wealthy families, who didnot need their feet to work, could afford to have them bound.) But when herfather died, her family fell on hard times, and the girl was literally “solddown the river” to settle debts. Sze Tai produced six children. Since the fatherwas from Holland, they were given the Chinese surname “Ho.”Mozes Hartog Bosman fell into serious financial difficulty and went bankrupt in1869. He abandoned his Chinese family, moved to California, and changed his nameto Charles Henri Maurice Bosman. To protect her children, Sze Tai became thefourth concubine to a Chinese cattle merchant, Kwok Chung. He had littleinterest in providing for her Eurasian children and barely gave them enoughmoney to eat, but Sze Tai convinced him to pay for the children’s tuition to theprestigious Central School (now Queen’s College), where they learned English.Robert Hotung was the eldest son of Sze Tai’s six children with Bosman. He grewup to become the comprador (foreign agent) for Jardine Matheson, the largesttrading conglomerate in East Asia. He made his fortune in shipping, insurance,real estate, and opium. By the age of thirty-five, Bruce Lee’s great-uncle wasthe wealthiest man in Hong Kong.To help him with his varied business interests, Robert Hotung hired his youngerbrother, Ho Kom Tong, who quickly became the second-richest man in Hong Kong.Bruce Lee’s grandfather’s two great passions were Cantonese Opera acting (heperformed onstage in support of fund-raising events for charity) and women. HoKom Tong married at the age of nineteen and soon after began taking concubinesuntil he reached twelve in total in Hong Kong. In the household he maintained inShanghai for business, Ho Kom Tong kept his thirteenth concubine, a Eurasianlady named Ms. Cheung. In Shanghai, he also had a secret British mistress, whoprovided him with another daughter, his thirtieth child, in 1911. Her name wasGrace Ho, or Ho Oi Yee in Chinese. Nothing is known about Grace Ho’s Englishmother or why she gave up her little girl, but Grace was raised by Ms. Cheung asher daughter.As the one half English, one quarter Dutch-Jewish, and one quarter Han Chinesechild of an elite Eurasian family in colonial Shanghai, Grace Ho’s upbringingwas very European. Instead of learning to read Chinese characters, she wastaught English and French. As a teenager, she studied Western medicine in hopesof becoming a nurse. She also converted to Catholicism, no doubt attracted toits absolute insistence on monogamy and condemnation of polygamy.Grace saw firsthand how miserable it made her adoptive mother to compete with adozen other concubines for the attention of one man. Grace was determined tolive a very different life. “She wasn’t happy with her father’s traditional,sinful ways,” says Phoebe Lee, Bruce’s older sister. Instead of accepting anarranged marriage as was common for Chinese and Eurasians of her class, Graceran off to Hong Kong when she was eighteen and moved in with her Uncle Robert.Grace became a socialite in Hong Kong, filling her days with fashionable socialgatherings. She was wealthy, independent, and single throughout her earlytwenties—a rarity for a Chinese woman in that era—until the day Li Hoi Chuen’sopera troupe came to Sir Robert Hotung’s Idlewild mansion.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Sir Robert intended the event for his friends, but his niece, Grace Ho, askedher uncle to allow her to attend. She had little experience with traditionalChinese art forms and wanted to see her first Cantonese Opera, which wasconsidered a lowbrow, vaudevillian entertainment for the Chinese masses.Li Hoi Chuen and his troupe rode the Star Ferry from Kowloon to Hong Kong Islandand trekked up to Idlewild at 8 Seymour Road, Mid-Levels. The actors paintedtheir faces with thick makeup, donned their ornate costumes, and tested theirkung fu weapons before marching into the courtyard to entertain this privateaudience of Eurasian elites.Grace was intrigued and delighted by the performances, but the longer shewatched the more her attention was drawn to a handsome young actor withexcellent comedic timing. “Just in those ten minutes or so when Dad was onstage,” says Robert Lee, Bruce’s younger brother, “Mom was deeply moved by hisperformance technique and developed feelings for him.” She fell in love becausehe made her laugh.In 1930s China it was unheard of for a woman to pursue a man, but Grace soughtout Li Hoi Chuen and charmed him. It was doubly scandalous for the daughter of awealthy family to become enamored with a struggling actor. Marriage was afinancial institution with little room for romance. Grace was supposed to wed awealthy Eurasian scion, not the son of illiterate Chinese peasants.Her entire clan was against the relationship. Threats were made. Pressure wasapplied. “But Mom was very independent, strong-willed, and adaptable,” saysRobert, “and she finally made up her mind she wanted to be with Dad.” As thechild of two cultures, Grace’s choice was a microcosm of the conflict betweenWestern individualism and Chinese tradition, romanticism versus familyobligation. In traditional China’s patriarchal, polygamous culture, Grace Ho wedfor love. She wasn’t formally disowned, but her decision to elope caused arupture and she was financially cut off. Grace went from being a wealthysocialite to the wife of a Chinese actor.Image [../images/sec.jpg]If Grace had any regrets, she never spoke of them. After her romantic rebellionagainst her family, she settled comfortably into the life of a simple Chinesewife. She dressed plainly, only wearing a cheongsam on special occasions. Sheloved to knit and play mahjong with her friends. Her personality embodied theChinese ideal for a woman—wenrou (Image [../images/ch-01.jpg])—quiet, gentle,and tender. “My mother was very patient, very kind, capable of controlling heremotions,” says Phoebe. “She was very refined, didn’t talk much, smiling allday, a traditional kind of woman.”Confucius modeled Chinese society on the patriarchal family—the emperor as thestern but benevolent father and the people as his obedient children. As the mostsuccessful member of his family, it was Li Hoi Chuen’s duty to support hisentire clan—to serve as its emperor. When Li Hoi Chuen’s father died, hesupported his mother as was expected of a filial son. “My father gave all hissalary to his mother, and my mother did the same,” Phoebe says. “My grandmotherwould only take a little and give it all back to my father. When he tried torefuse, she would tell him to take the money as if it were from her.” When oneof Hoi Chuen’s older brothers also passed away unexpectedly, he moved hisbrother’s widow and her five children into his and Grace’s tiny apartment.As his wife, it was Grace’s duty to support her husband and to produceoffspring, especially male heirs. (A popular Chinese saying—duo zi duo fu (Image[../images/ch-02.jpg])—“the more sons, the more happiness.”) To the utterdelight of her husband, Grace’s first child was a boy. Tragically, he died whenhe was three months old. Even though infant mortality rates were much higherthan now, the loss of a boy was still considered an evil portent, maybe even asign of a curse.When Grace was eight months pregnant with their second child, the family adoptedan infant girl and named her Phoebe. It was odd timing—Hoi Chuen was strugglingto support his mother and his dead brother’s family; he didn’t need any moremouths to feed. One explanation is Phoebe was a bad omen insurance policy.Superstition dictated the second child must be a girl; if Grace was pregnantwith a boy, he was in danger unless he had an older sister. The more likelyscenario is Phoebe wasn’t a random orphan girl. Hoi Chuen fathered her withanother woman, who, after she gave birth to a daughter instead of a highlyvalued son, gave the girl to Hoi Chuen to raise. For her part, Phoebe, who issensitive about the topic, claims to be a blood relative to her siblings: “Eventhough we had different personalities, we were close. Blood is thicker thanwater, our genes are the same!”A month after Phoebe’s adoption, Grace gave birth to another daughter, not ason. She was named Agnes. “Phoebe is my adopted daughter,” Li Hoi Chuen toldU.S. Immigration officials in 1941. “She is about 40 days older than my owndaughter, Agnes.”After Agnes, Grace was soon pregnant again and gave birth to a son, Peter, onOctober 23, 1939. His ear was immediately pierced. Even though he had two oldersisters, Peter was still considered to be in danger from the mythical ghouls whosteal little boys. Because their first son had died in infancy, any boy bornafterward had to be given girl’s clothing, a girl’s nickname, and a pierced earto trick the boy-hunting devil. It was an ancient custom and in this case itworked. Peter would live a long life, despite another demon roaming the land,killing children and adults in massive numbers—the Empire of Japan.Image [../images/sec.jpg]For two thousand years, China viewed itself as the most advanced civilization onearth—the country’s name Jong Guo (Image [../images/ch-03.jpg]) literally means“Center Country.”  The arrival of European colonialists with their superiormilitary technology shook Chinese chauvinism to its core. When the Qinggovernment tried to stop British traders from importing opium, which was causingan epidemic of addiction, the United Kingdom launched the First Opium War(1839–42) and crushed Chinese opposition. Suing for peace, the Qing emperor gaveaway Hong Kong—a rocky island with a population of only seven thousandfishermen—and opened a few treaty ports. Instead of appeasing the big-nosedbarbarians, the concessions displayed a weakness that whetted the appetites ofWestern imperialists. Britain, France, and America seized more territory,including sections of Shanghai, the country’s most important commercial city.The Chinese people viewed the loss of Shanghai to Westerners as a grievousinsult. It marked the beginning of what Chinese patriots called the “Century ofHumiliation.” In 1899, an uprising of Chinese martial artists (called Boxers),convinced that the mystical powers of kung fu could stop foreign bullets,converged on Beijing with the slogan “Support the Qing government andexterminate the foreigners.” It turned out their kung fu could not stophigh-speed metal projectiles and the Boxers along with the Chinese army backingthem were slaughtered by a seven-nation alliance of Britain, France, America,Germany, Italy, Austria-Hungary, and Japan. The failure of their government andkung fu to protect the Chinese people shattered their self-confidence andbrought down the Qing Dynasty in 1912, resulting in decades of chaos,warlordism, and civil war. China became known as the “Sick Man of Asia.”Unlike China, which was unable to adapt quickly enough, Japan rapidly adoptedWestern military technology and imperial policies. Imitating what the Europeanshad done in the Americas, Africa, and Asia, the Japanese sought to kick all theWesterners out of East Asia and colonize it for themselves. They set theirsights on the Sick Man. After grabbing territory along China’s periphery (theSenkaku Islands, Taiwan, Korea, Manchuria), the Japanese launched a full-scaleinvasion of the mainland on July 7, 1937, advancing rapidly and killingmillions.The British colony of Hong Kong served as a critical supply line in support ofChinese resistance and as a refugee camp—the population of the island increasedby 63 percent (over 600,000). After the outbreak of war between England andGermany in 1939, the British publicly kept up their trademark stiff upper lip,convincing their Chinese subjects they were safely protected by the invincibleBritish navy and the superiority of the white race. But in private, the Britishgovernment realized that “Hong Kong could not be expected to hold out for long”against a Japanese invasion and that “delaying action was the best to be hopedfor.”In this time of war and under the false sense of Pax Britannica security, Li HoiChuen and Grace Ho made a fateful decision. In the fall of 1939, Hoi Chuen’sopera troupe was invited for a year-long tour of America. The objective was toraise funds from the overseas Chinese community to support the war effort. Thecatch was he couldn’t bring along his entire family, just one person. AsJapanese forces were pushing ever closer to Hong Kong, Grace had to decide ifshe would join him and leave her three infant children (Peter was less than twomonths old) under the care of her mother-in-law or let her husband travelhalfway around the world for a year all by himself. It was Grace’s mother-in-lawwho convinced Grace to accompany her son. “My paternal grandmother said sheshould go with him or he might be tempted by someone else,” Phoebe says with achuckle. “She told my mother not to worry, so long as Grandma is here, no one isgoing to mistreat these three kids. So my mom went with him. Agnes, Peter, and Istayed in Hong Kong.”Hoi Chuen applied for a twelve-month nonimmigrant visa to the United States onNovember 15, 1939. His stated reason for coming to America was “theatrical workonly,” and he listed his occupation as “actor.” On Grace’s application, shewrote her purpose was “accompanying my husband.” She fudged her occupation as“actress, wardrobe woman.” In fact, she was a housewife and mother.The entire extended family went to the Hong Kong Harbor docks. Through theirtears, Hoi Chuen and Grace kissed their infant children goodbye and walked upthe ramp to their steamer ship, SS President Coolidge, for their long voyage toAmerica. It was the first time either of them had left Asia.Image [../images/sec.jpg]After a three-week journey with a stop in Honolulu, the President Coolidgefinally sailed into San Francisco Bay on December 8, 1939. Hoi Chuen and Gracegazed up in wonder at the recently built, two-year-old Golden Gate Bridge—thetallest and longest suspension bridge in the world. As the steamer slowly madeits way through the bay, the couple could see the federal prison on AlcatrazIsland and the 1939 World’s Fair being hosted on Treasure Island, featuring aneighty-foot statue of Pacifica, goddess of the Pacific Ocean. The Coolidgedocked at Angel Island, called “The Ellis Island of the West.” Chineseimmigrants seeking permanent residence were often detained for months. The 1882Chinese Exclusion Act, which was not repealed until 1943, prohibited allimmigration of low-skilled Chinese laborers. Since Hoi Chuen and Grace arrivedon a one-year cultural worker visa, they were processed relatively quickly.Greeted by a representative from the Mandarin Theatre, who had sponsored theirvisas, Hoi Chuen and Grace were guided through the streets of Chinatown. It wasthe largest enclave of Chinese outside Asia and the only neighborhood in SanFrancisco where Chinese could own property. Rebuilt after the 1906 earthquake,this warren of three- and four-story brick buildings over a twenty-four-blockarea had long been a major tourist attraction with its numerous restaurants,gambling dens, and brothels. The nightclub Forbidden City was famed for itsexotic Oriental performances. Li Po, which catered to a gay clientele,advertised itself as a “jovial and informal Chinatown cocktail lounge” where onecould find “love, passion, and nighttime.” At every intersection, Chinese boyshawked Chinese- and English-language newspapers. The headline story in the SanFrancisco Chronicle was the trial of a local labor leader as a Communist.Hoi Chuen and Grace walked down the busiest section of Grant Street in the heartof Chinatown to visit his place of work for the next year, the Mandarin Theatre.Built in 1924 with a distinctive green, red, and gold arched awning, theMandarin Theatre was a key player in Chinatown’s live opera (and later cinema)culture for decades. Its main competition was the Great China Theatre just oneblock east on Jackson Street. The two venues were constantly trying to out-billeach other by importing superior opera talent from China. It was as part of thisrivalry that the Mandarin had booked Hoi Chuen’s troupe, posting bonds with theImmigration Department for each actor and paying the talent far more than theycould have earned in Hong Kong.Hoi Chuen and Grace lived at the Mandarin Theatre’s boardinghouse on 18 TrentonStreet, a block away from the Chinese Hospital, the cornerstone of theneighborhood. It turned out to be a fortunate location. The Chinese Hospital wasthe only medical facility at the time that would treat Chinese patients. Gracediscovered she was pregnant again in April.As her due date approached, Hoi Chuen’s troupe was scheduled to perform in NewYork City. With great reluctance, he left his very pregnant wife alone in aforeign city and traveled by train across the country. Grace hid her anxietybehind a fixed smile. When she went into labor a few weeks later, neighborshelped her walk down the street to the hospital.A healthy baby boy—five eighths Han Chinese, one quarter English, and one eighthDutch-Jewish—was born at 7:12 a.m. on November 27, 1940.The neighbors called the Le Qian Qiu Theatre in New York’s Chinatown to leave amessage for Hoi Chuen: It’s a boy! When he heard the good news that night, HoiChuen celebrated with the entire cast by passing out cigarettes—the Chineseequivalent of passing out cigars.The first question all his fellow actors asked was: “What are his astrologicalsigns?”  The Chinese zodiac not only assigns one of twelve animals—rat, ox,tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig—to theyear of a person’s birth (called the outer animal), but also the month (inneranimal), the day (true animal), and the hour (secret animal). Of the twelvebirth signs, the dragon is considered the most powerful and propitious. Chineseemperors took the dragon as their symbol, causing it to be associated withleadership and authority. Many Chinese parents tried to time a pregnancy in thehopes that their child would be born in the year, month, day, or hour of thedragon.Hoi Chuen proudly told everyone that his boy was born in the year of the dragon,the month of the pig, the day of the dog, and the hour of the dragon. Two dragonsigns, especially if one was the year, were considered exceptionally auspicious.The troupe all congratulated him: “Your son is destined for greatness.”Back in San Francisco, Grace needed to pick out an American name for her son, anatural-born citizen of the United States. When Li Hoi Chuen applied for hisnonimmigrant visa, his surname was changed from “Li” to the Anglicized version“Lee”—Lee Hoi Chuen. And so on the boy’s birth certificate his last name wasalso written down as “Lee,” a subtle shift in spelling demarking a break withthe past and a new beginning. For the first name, Grace, who spoke littleEnglish, turned to a Chinese American friend for help. He consulted with themidwife, Mary E. Glover, who delivered the baby and signed the birthcertificate. She suggested Bruce.Alone with her son, Grace selected his Chinese name: Li Jun Fan (Image[../images/ch-04.jpg]). “Li” was the family surname. “Jun” was part of HoiChuen’s father’s name (Li Jun Biao) and meant “shake up, rouse, or excite.” And“Fan” is the Chinese character for San Francisco. So Bruce Lee’s Chinese namemeant “Shake Up and Excite San Francisco.”Hoi Chuen returned to his wife and newborn son as fast as he could. Grace wouldlater joke with friends that he arrived with his face still covered in brightCantonese Opera paint. Hoi Chuen decided his father’s life had been so cursed bymisfortune that it would be unlucky to use the same “Jun” character (Image[../images/ch-05.jpg]) in his son’s name. He changed it to a slightly different“Jun” character (Image [../images/ch-06.jpg]), meaning “echo, reverberate, orresound.” Hoi Chuen didn’t like “Bruce” either, but since it was alreadyrecorded on the birth certificate, it was too late. He complained, “I can’tpronounce it.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]Li Hoi Chuen came to America to raise funds from the overseas Chinese communityto support the war effort back home. As part of that process, he made a numberof close friends. One of them was Esther Eng, a pioneering female film directorwho specialized in patriotic war movies. While filming Golden Gate Girl, sheneeded a newborn girl for several scenes and asked Hoi Chuen if she could borrowBruce. He hesitated. Knowing intimately the vagaries of the artistic life, hedidn’t want his children to follow in his footsteps, but as a traditionalChinese man he deeply believed in guanxi (Image [../images/ch-07.jpg]), thesystem of relationships, connections, personal favors, and reciprocity thatundergirds and binds Chinese society together. When he later explained why hedecided to “lend out” his son, Hoi Chuen said that Chinese people have to helpeach other out, especially abroad. “Dad was very concerned about reciprocityamong friends,” says Robert Lee.Born on the road between curtain calls, Bruce Lee faced his first movie camerabefore he was old enough to crawl. It was his first and last cross-dressingperformance. In one brief scene, two-month-old Bruce is rocked to sleep in awicker bassinet, wearing a lacy bonnet and girl’s blouse. His mother, Grace, wasflustered to see her delicate child so transfigured for the camera. In anotherclose-up, a warmly wrapped baby Bruce cries inconsolably, eyes squeezed shut,mouth agape, arms flapping, chubby cheeks and double chin reverberating as thesound echoes through San Francisco.Because Bruce was too young to travel, the Li family overstayed their visa byfive months. It had been nearly a year and a half since Hoi Chuen and Grace hadseen their other young children. They were anxious to go home.But they worried Bruce might not be allowed to return to the United States.Discriminatory anti-Chinese immigration officials frequently deniedAmerican-born Chinese children reentry into the country by claiming they had“repatriated” (i.e., given up their U.S. citizenship) or questioning thevalidity of their paperwork. To ensure this didn’t happen to their son, HoiChuen and Grace hired the appropriately named law firm of White & White,submitted documentary evidence of Bruce’s birth in San Francisco, applied for aCitizen’s Return Form for their son, and submitted to questioning under oath bythe U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Services. Attached to Bruce’sapplication for return was a photo of the chubby, healthy, three-month-old boywith a smattering of hair and pierced left ear. The stated reason for leavingthe United States was “a temporary visit abroad.”  The visit would last eighteenyears.Departing from the port of San Francisco, they stepped onto the deck of the SSPresident Pierce on April 6, 1941, for the eighteen-day journey back to HongKong. Hoi Chuen must have considered his time away a rousing success. His wifehad given birth to a second son—an heir and a spare. As one of the most famousactors on the tour, Hoi Chuen had helped stir the patriotic hearts of manyChinese Americans. “Upon hearing my father sing such pieces as ‘Prime MinisterUniting the Six Kingdoms,’ ‘Martyrs for the Ming Royal Family,’ and ‘The CrimsonKnights,’ many overseas Chinese were moved to volunteer and donate,” says RobertLee.Every little bit of reciprocity was necessary and needed, because Bruce and hisparents were returning home to a situation that was turning from bad to worse.Image [../images/sec.jpg]No one was happier to see her son and daughter-in-law return safely to their oldapartment on Mau Lam Street than Grandma Li, who was already seventy years old.She had carefully watched over Phoebe, Agnes, and Peter for eighteen months, aswell as her widowed daughter-in-law and five children in a tiny two-bedroom,one-bathroom flat. Everyone was overjoyed to meet the newest member of thefamily, Bruce Jun Fan. Grandma Li nicknamed him Tiny Phoenix—the femalecounterpart to the dragon in Chinese mythology—in order to keep him safe fromthe ox ghosts and snake spirits, who liked to hurt little boys. “Though Daddidn’t much like this girl’s name, he was always very respectful of his mother’swishes,” says Robert Lee, “and so went along with it.”  The excitement anddelight of the reunion was soon dampened by terrible news abroad and at home.World War II was engulfing the planet in fire and blood. Japanese forces weredriving deep into China’s heartland. In Europe, the German Luftwaffe was bombingBritish cities and German U-boats were sinking supply ships from America. HongKong was cut off from both China and Britain, helpless and alone.As the Chinese and the British fought for their very survival, so did youngBruce Jun Fan Lee. Born in San Francisco’s peaceful chill air, the chubby infantboy fell dangerously ill in Hong Kong’s humid, cockroach-infested, wartimeenvironment. A cholera outbreak was ravaging the colony. Bruce Jun Fan became soweak and thin his parents feared he might die. Having already lost one boy,Grace constantly hovered over her ailing son. “I think I spoiled him because hewas so sick,” Grace later said. Because of his near-fatal illness, Bruce Leegrew up frailer than the other children. He could not walk without stumblinguntil he was four years old.On December 8, 1941, the day everyone had feared for years finally arrived inthe British colony. Eight hours after their sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, Japaninvaded Hong Kong, declaring war on America and Britain at the same time. TheAllied garrison of British, Canadian, Indian, and a small group of Chinesevolunteers was outnumbered four to one (Japanese 52,000; Allied 14,000).Thousands of civilians were killed as the battle raged through Kowloon on thesouthern tip of mainland China and across the harbor into Hong Kong Island. Oneof those who nearly died was Bruce’s father, Hoi Chuen. Like many CantoneseOpera singers, he was an opium smoker. When Hoi Chuen was sharing a pipe with afellow actor at a neighborhood opium den, a bomb from a Japanese plane crashedthrough the roof, smashed his friend in the bed next to his, and plunged downinto the basement, carrying his friend’s body with it. The bomb failed toexplode—the only reason Hoi Chuen survived.It took less than three weeks for the Japanese to conquer the exposed imperialoutpost on December 25, 1941—known forever after in Hong Kong as “BlackChristmas.” It was the first time a British colony had ever surrendered to aninvading force. Whatever resentment the Chinese felt about the British and theirlaissez-faire colonial rule was nothing compared to their horror at thetotalitarian brutality of their new Japanese masters, who decided the best wayto control the colony was to depopulate it. Anyone who did not have residence oremployment was forced to leave. Those who remained suffered under a reign ofterror. Ten thousand women were gang-raped. In the three years and eight monthsof Japanese occupation, the population dropped from 1.5 million to 600,000. Onethird escaped, mostly to the nearby Portuguese colony of Macau, one thirdsurvived by whatever means necessary, and the rest were starved or killed.Japanese sentries regularly shot or beheaded passing Chinese who failed to bow.Random civilians were killed for jujitsu practice, being thrown roughly to theground repeatedly until unable to move and then bayoneted. An average of threehundred corpses were collected from the streets every day for the duration ofthe occupation—those who weren’t murdered died from disease or malnourishment.Li Hoi Chuen was the only breadwinner for a household of thirteen people. Ifforced to flee to Macau, it was unlikely all family members would survive,especially his infant son, Bruce, who had barely recovered from his near-fatalillness. Fortunately for Hoi Chuen and his dependents, the Japanese had afondness for Chinese Opera. The head of the Japanese Ministry of Media, WakudaKosuke, made an offer to all the famous opera performers—including Hoi Chuen,who was one of the four great comedic “clown” actors—that they couldn’t refuse.What exactly was said is unknown. “Dad never talked to anyone about it,” saysRobert Lee. “But considering the Japanese tactic of using food rationing tothreaten people, we can only imagine he had no other choice.” Phoebe says, “TheJapanese forced my father to perform, but they didn’t pay him with money. Theypaid him with rice instead, so we had rice for one meal once a week. The rest ofthe time we ground up tapioca to make bok-chan (Cantonese pancakes).”The Japanese believed the continuation of opera performances created animpression of peace throughout their so-called Greater East Asia Co-ProsperitySphere, so Hoi Chuen’s job as an opera actor gave his family a slightly elevatedstatus. Grace would later tell her children that when the Japanese soldiers camearound, she only had to claim her husband was a Chinese Opera actor and theywouldn’t give her any trouble.In densely populated prewar Hong Kong, the most valuable asset was real estate.By removing two thirds of its people, the Japanese inadvertently flooded thehousing market with available properties. Suddenly, the few like Hoi Chuen whohad decent jobs and food rations could dramatically improve their lot. About ayear into the occupation, he moved his thirteen-member family into afour-thousand-square-foot apartment—extremely spacious by Hong Kong standards.The flat’s biggest selling point was its location at 218 Nathan Road, Kowloon.It was directly across a small park from the Japanese occupation headquarters,making the neighborhood safe from the desperate criminality of starving localstrying to survive. Over the next two years, Hoi Chuen cleverly purchased atdepressed prices four more apartments as rental properties.Even for lucky families like the Lis, life was a daily fight for survival,filled with deprivation, misery, and humiliation. A strict nighttime curfew wasenforced along with a requirement of absolute silence. One night during theoccupation, one of Bruce’s aunts was loudly playing mahjong at a friend’sapartment, causing Japanese soldiers to kick in the door and order them to stop.When Auntie objected in an even louder voice, a Japanese soldier slapped heracross the face, forced her to bow, and made her apologize one hundred times.The collective shame and loss of face suffered during the occupation led many tooverstate their resistance after it was over. In one of the earliest tales thefamily liked to tell about Bruce Jun Fan, the patriotic toddler reportedly wouldstand on the apartment’s balcony and “shake his fist defiantly at Japaneseplanes flying overhead.” It’s a prideful image with one small problem. By thetime young Bruce, born November 27, 1940, was old enough to stand and raise aclenched hand, the Japanese had already lost air superiority over the colony tothe Allies. If Bruce ever shook his fist at a foreign plane, it was an Americanone. “I was in Macau for the war,” Marciano Baptista, a classmate of Bruce’solder brother, Peter, says. “American planes attacked the power and oil stationsin ’43, ’44. We still shook our fists at them, because they were causing chaos.”While the Allies controlled the air for several years, the liberation of HongKong had to wait until after Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and the surrender of Japan onAugust 15, 1945. Both Chinese and American officials expected control of HongKong to be returned to China, but the British, who considered restoration ofcolonial rule a matter of honor and a necessity for their Asian commercialinterests, raced a Royal Navy task force to Hong Kong to accept the Japanesesurrender and reclaim Hong Kong for themselves on August 30.In retrospect, it was the best possible outcome for the people of Hong Kong.China was about to be consumed by a civil war between the Nationalists and theCommunists, led by Mao Zedong, that would further tear the country apart andthen sink it into decades of isolation and turmoil. In contrast, Hong Kongerswould flourish, especially families like the Lis, who enjoyed their mostprosperous period following the bitterness of the Three Year Eight MonthOccupation."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f0028-01.jpg]Ten-year-old Bruce Lee’s first starring role as an orphan in My Son A-Chang(1950)—also called The Kid (Courtesy of Hong Kong Heritage Museum)Image [../images/f0028-02.jpg]In the movie The Orphan (1960), Bruce’s troubled teenage character pulls a knifeon his teacher. (Courtesy of Hong Kong Heritage Museum)"},{"pageContent":"TWOBOOMTOWNAfter Hong Kong was liberated, everyone who had been banished came floodingback, along with hundreds of thousands of refugees from China’s civil war. Thefirst to arrive packed themselves into every available room—each divided intoten or more “bed spaces”—until there was nothing left for the remainders but thehillside shantytowns. In five years, the population jumped from 600,000 to threemillion, and rental prices went through the roof. Suddenly, Li Hoi Chuen was notonly an actor but also a successful landlord.Owning four apartments did not make him a tycoon—he was not in the top onepercent like Bruce’s great-uncle Robert Hotung—but it did secure his largefamily’s financial future. “My parents were not real rich, but we never had toworry about food or clothing,” Bruce told friends later in life. In fact, thefamily was more than comfortable. By the Third World standards of postwar HongKong, they were affluent and could afford the latest luxuries. “By 1950, we hada TV, a fridge, a car, and a driver,” Phoebe recalls. “We didn’t have a sense ofsocial classes, but if you had a TV, you must be in the upper class.” Along witha driver, they also had two live-in servants, plus a cat, a tankful of goldfish,and five wolfhounds. Through a combination of talent, shrewdness, and luck, HoiChuen had climbed a long way from his impoverished childhood.After the deprivations of the occupation, the children flourished in theirnewfound prosperity. Phoebe and Bruce were the extroverted, fun-loving siblings,while Peter and Agnes were the introverted, studious ones. “They didn’t talkmuch and were serious about everything they did,” says Phoebe. “Bruce and I weredifferent. We would fight one minute and then be fine the next. We were lazy,but I wasn’t as lazy as him. If we were too lazy, our father would scold and notfeed us.”The illness and frailty that haunted Bruce during the occupation lost its gripafter the liberation. He became so hyperactive his family nicknamed him “NeverSits Still.” He was forever jumping, talking, playing, or moving. Peterremembers that if Bruce was ever quiet for a long period his mother thought hemust be sick. “He almost had a disorder which filled him with too much extraenergy like a wild horse that had been tied up,” says Robert. When he wasn’tknocking over furniture in a whirlwind of chaos, Bruce was questioningeverything his parents told him to do, earning him yet another nickname, “WhyBaby.” (His skeptical attitude toward authority lasted his entire life. Thedirector of The Big Boss (1971) called Bruce in exasperation, “The Why Dragon.”)His parents discovered the only way to calm Bruce down—his “off-switch”—was tohand him a comic book. He would read quietly for hours. Prior to the advent oftelevision in Hong Kong in 1957, comic books and magazines, like The Children’sParadise, were a major form of entertainment. Bruce started with kung fu comicbooks and graduated to sword-and-sorcery martial arts (in Chinese, wuxia)novels—devoting much of his spare time to bookstores. Bruce read so much hismother believed it caused him to be nearsighted. “He used to spend hours in bedreading comic books with small type without my permission,” recalls Grace. “Ithink that is what contributed to his poor eyesight.” Bruce began wearingcorrective glasses at the age of six.All of those comic books and fantasy novels created a rich inner life. As heread, Bruce imagined himself as the story’s hero. Once Grace rebuked her son foracting selfishly, “You are really no use, child. You seem to hardly have anysoft spot for your own family.”  To defend himself, Bruce told a story, “If wewere ever walking in the forest and came across a tiger, I’d stay and fight thetiger and let the rest of you escape.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]Along with the rental properties and his salary as a stage actor, Hoi Chuendeveloped a new source of income: the movies. Before the war, the managingdirector of China’s biggest studio, Lianhua, was Bruce’s great-uncle RobertHotung. Its head office was initially in Hong Kong until it became clear thatShanghai was the Mecca of Chinese filmmaking. As Shanghai’s influence grew,initiating the first golden age of Chinese cinema in the 1930s, Hong Kong turnedinto a regional branch office, making cheap flicks in the local dialect,Cantonese. The Japanese invasion effectively halted all movie production until1945. The only Hong Kong film made during the three years and eight months ofsubjugation was the Japanese propaganda film The Battle for Hong Kong (1942).The cast was mostly Japanese, but many Hong Kong film personalities wereforcefully asked to participate, including Bruce’s father. He courageouslyrefused. This wise decision saved his career—those who appeared in the moviewere blacklisted after the war as collaborators.After liberation, the continuing civil war in mainland China caused manyShanghai artists to relocate to Hong Kong. The initial trickle of migratingtalent transformed into a flood after Mao Zedong’s victory in 1949 and theCommunist Party’s decision to close their market, ban all foreign films, andonly allow the production of government-censored propaganda movies. By 1950,Hong Kong was the Hollywood of the East, the center of the Chinese filmmakingworld.As a famous stage actor and one of the few to survive the occupation with hisreputation intact, Hoi Chuen was well positioned to take advantage of the boomin movie productions. He became a character actor in dozens of films, oftenplaying for laughs a comic archetype—the miserly rich guy who gets hiscomeuppance—a Chinese Scrooge. While movie actors weren’t paid well by modernstandards, it was far more lucrative than stage work. “The money he made forshooting a movie was about half the price of an apartment back then,” saysTakkie Yeung, the Hong Kong director of The Brilliant Life of Bruce Lee.As part of the nascent movie industry, Hoi Chuen was friendly with all the majorplayers, often inviting them over to his home. He also brought his childrenon-set with him. None of them took to the jungle-gym-like backlots with as muchexcitement as “Never Sits Still.” “Bruce climbed the wooden ladders to reach thesuspended studio lights. We were afraid he would lose his grip. He wanted totouch everything from the cameras to the sound equipment,” remembers one of theactresses, Feng So Po. “He was so naughty they taught him hand games to distracthim.”When Bruce was six years old, the director of his father’s latest film saw himon-set and was so impressed that he offered him a part. At first, both Bruce andhis father thought he was joking. “Bruce was wide eyed, open mouthed, anddeliriously happy,” says his mother, Grace. It was his first part—playing arunaway boy who becomes a pickpocket and is run over by a truck—in the Cantonesetearjerker The Birth of Mankind (1946). A forgettable flick that flopped at thebox office, it is only notable for typecasting young Bruce as a tough, wilystreet urchin with a heart of gold, a kind of Artful Dodger. It was a characterhe would play repeatedly for the rest of his childhood acting career.In his next film, Wealth Is like a Dream (1948), he once again was cast as alost boy on his own after the war. His father, Hoi Chuen, was a costar in thefilm and the movie promoters, seeking to play off the family connection and hisfather’s fame, gave Bruce a new stage name, Little Hoi Chuen. The newspaperseven advertised “Cameo by Wonder Kid Little Li Hoi Chuen.” Bruce’s career, downto his diminutive screen name, began in the shadow of Hoi Chuen’s star. The sonwould spend the rest of his life determined to outshine his father.Bruce’s first chance to win a victory in this Oedipal battle came with his fifthfilm, My Son A-Chang (also titled The Kid) in 1950. Based on a popular comicbook by Po-Wan Yuen, it was by the standards of the time a serious, big-budgetfilm. The director, Feng Feng, interviewed a number of child actors but none ofthem was right for the title role of A-Chang—a tough, wily street urchin with aheart of gold—until he saw the fiendish energy of Bruce’s previous screen work.Director Feng personally visited 218 Nathan Road to ask for the father’sblessing but was, to his surprise, rebuffed. A leading role in a major moviethreatened to turn what was an extracurricular activity into a full-time career,and Hoi Chuen, to his credit, was not at all certain he wanted his son to followin his theatrical footsteps. He hoped his children would become well-educatedmiddle-class professionals—doctors, lawyers, bankers. Director Feng praised hisson’s talent, spoke of his destiny as an entertainer, and, when all this failed,offered Hoi Chuen a major role in the film—as the miserly, rich boss who issecretly a soft touch—so he could keep an eye on his boy during filming.“Finally, Dad agreed,” says Robert, “and this decision would change Bruce’slife.”Following the civil war in China, the early 1950s Hong Kong film community waspolitically charged and ideologically divided between left-wing Communistsympathizers and right-wing Nationalists. My Son A-Chang is a solid example ofsocialist agitprop. Bruce, as A-Chang, is an orphan boy living with his uncle, ateacher who is paid so poorly he can’t afford to send his nephew to school. HoiChuen, playing Boss Hong, the owner of a sweatshop, hires A-Chang’s uncle as hisprivate secretary and arranges for A-Chang to attend a private school, where heis bullied as the new kid, gets into a fight, and is promptly expelled. A-Changthen falls in with a gang of former war veterans who have been forced by thecruel capitalist system into a life of crime. “We have to steal to survive,”says the leader, Flying Blade Lee.After a bungled attempt to rob Boss Hong’s factory ends in murder, Flying Bladenobly agrees to take all the blame, instructing his fellow hoodlums to flee andreform their ways: “No more crime. Find a proper job. You just have to workhard. Give A-Chang my share of the money, so he and his uncle can farm invillages.”  The movie ends with A-Chang and his uncle, the former teacher,happily heading to the countryside to restart their lives as peasants. The moviepredates the Cultural Revolution by twenty-five years, where teachers andintellectuals were forcibly relocated to the countryside to be reeducated aspeasants.Politics aside, ten-year-old Bruce’s performance displays a range of emotionsand raw talent. In one scene he is humorously imitating his teacher; in another,he puffs himself up with cocky bravado by throwing his shoulders back andthumbing his nose at an opponent—one of his signature moves as an adult actor.In an elaborately choreographed fight, he fearlessly jumps onto the back of theevil factory foreman, who shakes him off and takes a wild swing. Bruce ducks itand head-butts his adult enemy in the stomach like a charging ram. When one ofthe foreman’s punches finally lands, young Bruce rips open his shirt, pulls outa knife tucked inside his pants, and charges at the foreman, who runs away interror. Bruce would later re-create this scene in real life, getting himselfinto serious trouble.For Bruce Lee fans, the movie is most notable for the new screen name given tothe lead actor. Previously known as Little Hoi Chuen, the film’s opening creditslist him as Li Long (Image [../images/ch-08.jpg]) or “Dragon Li.” Given hispint-sized stature, this was quickly converted to Li Xiao Long (Image[../images/ch-09.jpg]) or “Little Dragon Li.” Bruce loved his new screen name somuch he insisted on using it in his private life. From then on, all of hisfriends called him Little Dragon Li, many of them having no idea that his birthname was Li Jun Fan. If names have a magical power, this film marked the momentwhen Bruce Jun Fan Little Dragon Li Lee’s personal life and movie persona beganto merge, overlap, and bleed into each other.My Son A-Chang opened in late May of 1950. It was a box office and criticalsuccess. Plans were immediately made for a sequel, but the project was soonscuttled by Bruce’s father, who refused to allow his son to appear in it. Hisgeneral concerns about his children following in his footsteps into thetopsy-turvy entertainment industry had become very specific in regards to Bruce,who was becoming as rebellious and difficult to handle as the characters heplayed in his films.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Hoi Chuen had always kept a close eye on his baby boy. He frequently took Bruceon special fishing trips and backstage during stage performances. To strengthenhis body, Hoi Chuen would often bring Bruce, starting at the age of seven, alongwith him to King’s Park in the morning to practice Tai Chi together. The slowmeditative art form, which uses soft to conquer hard and stillness to conquerspeed, was Bruce Lee’s first style of martial arts and a test of his patience.“Dad also wanted to use Tai Chi as a way to help with Bruce’s hyperactivetendencies,” says Robert. Bruce enjoyed the special father-son time, but not TaiChi. “I got tired of it quickly,” he later explained. “It was no fun for a kid.Just a bunch of old men.” In addition, he found its techniques useless for whatwas quickly becoming his favorite extracurricular activity—fighting.Bruce’s mother, Grace, was a devout Catholic and personal friends with manyEuropean and American nuns and priests. Wanting her children to have the bestpossible education, she enrolled them in the finest Catholic schools in theBritish colony. “To send her children to whichever parochial school was as easyas placing a phone call for her,” says Robert. For their elementary schooleducation, Grace sent her daughters to St. Mary’s School run by European nunsand her sons to Tak Sun, an all-boys parochial school.When Bruce entered Tak Sun at the age of six, he was at a distinct disadvantage.Physically weaker and smaller than the other boys with perhaps lingering balanceissues from his childhood illness, he was never able to learn how to ride abike. He was also terrified of the water. “Bruce was already quite mischievous.Our sisters thought they’d ‘teach him a lesson’ by holding him underwater at theLai Chi Kok Amusement Park swimming pavilion and not letting him come back up,”says Robert. “It scared him so badly he never dared to swim again.” Severelynearsighted, Bruce wore thick, horn-rim glasses, and his ear was pierced toprotect him from boy-stealing snake demons. “He even wore an earring to school,inviting much teasing from his classmates,” says Robert.Most scrawny, four-eyed boys would have hidden in the corner, downcast, lost infantasy. But not Bruce. Just like his character in My Son A-Chang, he waspugnacious and short-tempered. Anyone who teased him or made him lose face, hefought right then, right there. It didn’t matter if they were bigger or smaller,taller or shorter, older or younger, he fought them all, until he developed areputation and the other boys stopped picking on him.While Bruce started out defending himself against insults, he quickly acquired ataste for combat and was soon instigating fights himself. His reputation shiftedfrom someone you didn’t want to mess with to the boy it was best to avoid.Parents began warning their sons to stay away from him.“We were playing marbles,” Anthony Yuk Cheung, his third-grade classmate,recalls. “He took a shot put and smashed some of our marbles. We went to anothercorner of the playground. He followed us and ruined the rest of our marbles. Iran away, but he chased me, so I fought him. That was the first time in my life.There is a Chinese saying, ‘Corner a dog in a dead-end street, and it will turnand bite.’ ”Bruce’s remarkably forgiving Catholic instructors, who had a boys-will-be-boysapproach to discipline, plotted ways to keep the Little Dragon contained. “Hewas a real pain in the neck for any teacher, a proverbial devil in the holywater soup,” remembers Brother Henry, one of his teachers. “I waged a battle onhis hyperactive problem and won it. The strategy was simple—Bruce was basicallya good boy and a maverick if you understood him and handled him right. He was alive wire charged with I do not know how many kilowatts. So each morning myfirst step was to preempt that energy and tire him out before he caused trouble.I gave him all the odd jobs I could think of: opening all the windows, cleaningblackboards, getting the register from the office, and running errands all overschool. When that didn’t work I sent him to the headmaster with a note, ‘Sendingyou Bruce to have a few moments of peace.’ Looking back on who he became as aman, I’m glad I did not suppress or snuff him out.”Bruce hated school. Sitting still in a classroom was nearly impossible for him.He fidgeted and couldn’t focus on the lessons. While he loved reading comicbooks and martial arts novels, he despised his textbooks, refusing to crack themopen. He was a bright child who got terrible grades because he refused to do hishomework. What must have made this even worse for Bruce was the fact that hisolder brother, Peter, was a model student—the scholarly overachiever who acedall his exams. “Dad was very fond of Peter, because he was studious, had abright future, and, like himself, was very quiet,” says Robert.To help her wayward son, Grace hired a private tutor for Bruce. Acting like anobedient child, he would dutifully leave the house to visit the tutor, carryingan armload of books. An hour or two later the tutor would call Grace, “Where’sBruce?” When Bruce returned home—his clothes ragged and torn, his booksunopened—he’d swear he had been with the tutor the entire time. “Bruce wasgenerally off with friends, fighting in the street,” recalls Grace. “He didn’tknow the tutor had just called. I’d ask him where he’d been, and he’d tell me hejust finished studying.”Bruce had joined a gang. Or to be more precise he had formed his own gang. TheLittle Dragon didn’t take orders—he gave them. His classmates say he had a halfdozen or so “followers,” who did his bidding. Two of them would remain loyal tohim his entire life. Wu Ngan was the son of the main servant in the Lihousehold. Growing up together, they were like brothers. Wu Ngan would laterbecome Bruce’s manservant when they were adults. There was no one Bruce trustedmore. The other was Unicorn Chan, a childhood actor Bruce had met on the set ofThe Birth of Mankind (1946). Unicorn would later help Bruce as an adult revivehis movie career in Hong Kong.Unlike in the movie My Son A-Chang, these boys were not street urchins. Theywere mostly middle-class kids attending prestigious parochial schools. They wererabble-rousers, not gangsters, causing minor trouble, not committing seriouscrimes. Besides getting into fights, their main leisure activity was pranks.“One night, when our maid went out for the evening, Bruce moved all thefurniture in her room to different spots,” remembers Grace. “The nearest lightwas in the center of the room, so when she returned she banged and bumped intoalmost every chair and table until she reached it. Afterward, she was furiousand came to me saying she knew it was Bruce. I promised I would talk to him butfound it very hard to keep from laughing myself.”As he grew older the pranks became more sophisticated and aggressive, especiallyif he felt he was avenging his family or his friends. At the age of ten, Bruceand Wu Ngan tried to sneak into the Dongle Theatre at the corner of Nathan andNullah Roads. Bruce made it inside but Wu Ngan was caught by the South Asianticket-taker, scolded, and smacked across the head. Filled with rage, Brucerushed outside and yelled for the man to stop, resulting in both of them beingpunished. They spent the next two weeks plotting their revenge. They boughtpiping-hot, fragrant roast squid from a nearby food stall, to which theysecretly added a laxative, and then offered it, with profuse apologies, to theticket-taker. Now most ten-year-old pranksters would have stopped here, but notBruce. Instead, the boys hid inside one of the bathroom stalls with a carefullyprepared bucket full of excrement waiting for the ticket-taker to relievehimself. When the laxative-laced squid forced him to the bathroom, the boysstuck a four-inch firecracker into the crap-filled bucket, lit it, and slid thebucket under the stall door right in front of the ticket-taker. When it blew, itcovered the man in feces. Bruce was banned from the theater for six months.Grace, who later worried she had spoiled Bruce, played the good cop. Shescolded, cajoled, and pleaded with him, hiding many of his infractions from hisfather. When Bruce went too far, like with the movie ticket-taker, Grace calledin the enforcer. “Bruce knew how much his father hated violence,” says Grace. “Iwould always threaten to tell on him if he didn’t start behaving. He alwayspromised to, but he kept fighting.”While Hoi Chuen played the comic clown onstage and in the movies, his primaryrole at home was as the stern, emotionally distant disciplinarian—an archetypefamiliar to most Chinese children. “Each time Bruce did something wrong, myfather would punish all of us,” Phoebe recalls, chuckling. “It was ourresponsibility to look after our younger brother. He’d twist our ears, close thedoor, and make us kneel. He would say, ‘Dare to misbehave now?’ Then he wouldhit each of us—boys with a bamboo stick, and girls with a rolled-up newspaper.Bruce would ask why the girls only got hit with a newspaper. Dad would say,‘Because sisters are girls, and newspapers don’t hurt so much, but you boysmisbehave so much, you won’t think it hurts enough.’ Often he didn’t have to hitBruce—he could scare Bruce with just one look. Dad had this awe about him.”The bad grades, the constant fighting, the increasingly violent pranks—LittleDragon was bringing disgrace on his family, making his parents lose face. Afterhis stunt with the ticket-taker at the Dongle Theatre, something had to be done.Besides his comic books, the only thing Bruce truly loved was acting. While hismother could barely drag him out of bed in the mornings for school, she had notrouble waking him to go to the film studio in the wee hours. (To avoid the loudcity noises of Hong Kong and its nearby airport, studios did most of theirfilming at night. It wasn’t until the 1960s that they began to record the audioseparately and dub it in.) “Bruce was a natural,” Robert says. “Awakened in themiddle of the night, he was on his feet and in character right away.”Since no other type of punishment seemed to work, his father put him in amovie-acting “time out,” until he started to behave. He barred the Little Dragonfrom taking part in the sequel to My Son A-Chang. For the rest of 1950, Brucedid not appear in another film. After much begging from Bruce, they allowed himto make one movie in 1951, The Beginning of Man, but since his behavior did notimprove, they banned him again. The Little Dragon did not appear on-screen againuntil 1953, a two-year hiatus.Far from being stage parents, Hoi Chuen and Grace viewed acting as a privilege,not a career, to be taken away if Bruce didn’t study hard. Hoi Chuen had grownup so poor he couldn’t afford to attend school. He didn’t want one of his sonsto miss out on a good education—or make the same mistakes he had.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Hong Kong was still awash in opium a century after its conquest. While thecolonial government had officially banned the drug in 1908, enforcement was lax.Up until the 1960s, the number of opium addicts, especially in the entertainmentindustry, continued to grow. One of them was Bruce’s father. “It helps mytheater voice,” Hoi Chuen claimed, “and sweetens my singing.” Opium was toChinese Opera singers what heroin was to American jazz musicians. A Cantoneseslang term for smoking opium was “chewing rhyme.”Hoi Chuen’s favorite acting role, and his most famous performance, was in theplay Two Opium Addicts Sweep the Dike. This comedy about two bony, skinny opiumfiends sent to do cleanup work in Guangzhou after the government prohibitedopium required (allowed) the two lead actors, Li Hoi Chuen and Sun-Ma Sze-Tsang,to smoke opium onstage night after night.It was perfect casting for Hoi Chuen, who had done plenty of personal researchinto the subject. In his bedroom at home, he had a king-sized opium bed. Manyfamous actors and directors visited the apartment to get their fix. “Dad lovedto lie on the right side, leaving the left side free for guests,” says Phoebe.As a young girl, she curried favor by assisting him and his friends. “Why did Iget along best with my father? My father taught me how to light up the pipe andgive it to him to smoke.”Sometime in the early 1950s, opium drew Hoi Chuen deeper and deeper into itseuphoric, languid, sweet oblivion. He lost interest in anything but sleep andsmoking more. According to Grace, he was close to the children when they wereyounger, but as they got older he changed and had very little to do with hisfamily: “He spent most of his time in his room studying or sleeping and didn’tsit with the family except at meals.” Bruce later told his wife, Linda, hisfather was “an absentee parent,” who, because of his habit, “was often notmentally there for him.”Besides the emotional costs, there were the financial. “Only rich people couldsmoke opium at that time,” Phoebe says. “You couldn’t smoke if you didn’t havethe money. It was a very fashionable thing!” Hoi Chuen had over a dozen mouthsto feed, plus the giant monkey on his back. The cost of supplying his habit andthe ravaging effect addiction had on his acting career threatened his family’supper-class status. Bruce frequently complained to his teenage friends about hisfather’s “stinginess” and the lack of spending money. For years Grace pleadedwith her husband to quit without success.The effect of the father’s addiction on his children was to exaggerate theirnatural inclinations. The sensitive, studious Peter buried his head in hishomework and focused on individual sports, becoming an elite fencer. He was theson everyone in the family expected to be the first to attend college. In sharpcontrast, hyperactive Bruce appeared to be heading to jail. He exhibited many ofthe classic symptoms of a child of a drug-abusing parent: aggression, distrustof authority figures, and excessive need to be in control.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Following in the footsteps of his older brother, ten-year-old Bruce entered LaSalle in September 1951 as a fifth-grader. Run by the Catholic LasallianBrothers, La Salle, located at the time on Perth Street, was one of the mostprestigious secondary schools in Hong Kong. Most of its students were upper- andmiddle-class Chinese and Eurasians, although there were a number of scholarshipstudents. Its great advantage was the entire curriculum was taught in English,producing bilingual graduates. This guaranteed a decent job in the Britishcolony. “You could join the police, a bank, the civil service,” says MarcianoBaptista, a classmate of Bruce’s older brother, Peter. Without his eliteeducation at La Salle, Bruce Lee would never have made it in Hollywood, wherethe ability to speak English is a prerequisite, especially for Asian actors.English was one of the few subjects in which Bruce excelled. Overall, he was aterrible student, especially in math. “He never got beyond the stage of simpleaddition and subtractions—and he managed to stay in school at all only becausehe bullied other youngsters into doing his homework for him,” says Linda Lee.His mother joked, “By the time he was ten, that was as far as he could count.”One of his classmates says that he let Bruce peep at his test paper during examsfor 50 cents. Despite the bullying and bribery, Bruce was held back twice in thefive years he attended La Salle. It was far more common back then than it is nowto be asked to repeat a grade, but Bruce was still considered a particularlypoor student, one of the worst in his class, while Peter was one of the best.Like many Hong Kong bad boys (called in Cantonese slang “teddy boys”), Bruce’sfavorite time was recess. Out from under the thumb of the adult authorityfigures, he set out to establish control by recruiting his classmates into hiscrew. He flitted from one boy to another, joking, cajoling, and promising. “Hewould often put his arm around his schoolmates and just say to them, ‘If anyoneis causing you trouble, just let me know and I will take up the matter withthem,’ ” recalls classmate Pau Siu Hung. Other boys he tried to win over withhis cutup sense of humor. For laughs and attention, he would imitate King Kong,inflating his barrel chest, pounding it with his fists, and shrieking like anape. He often called himself the Monkey King. “He was always talking and likedto make jokes so he always had lots of friends,” recalls the introverted Peter.His contemporaries remember him strutting around the playground with a “bounce,”his heels hardly touching the ground. Michael Lai, a childhood friend, describesyoung Bruce’s personality as “teeth brushing,” slang for boastful, cocky, apeacock.Bruce was not, according to his peers, a bully in the classic sense: a sadistwho takes pleasure in humiliating weaker boys. Rather he was a gang leader,offering protection to those willing to follow him. Robert Lee, who idolizes hisolder brother and tends to paint him in the most positive light, says, “Brucewas more often like a hero in a chivalry movie—always trying to defend the weakfrom the strong, like a knight-errant-type character.”  This was true formembers of his crew, whom he looked after and fiercely protected. In return,they hailed him as “big brother,” did his homework, and let him cheat off theirtests. “He had a mesmerizing leadership that made people submit,” says MichaelLai.“From boyhood to adolescence, I was a bit of a troublemaker and was greatlydisapproved of by my elders,” Bruce later told reporters. “I was extremelymischievous and aggressive.” He focused his aggression on his rivals, theleaders of other cliques. The Little Dragon believed everyone should followhim—respect his authority. “Bruce picked on the boys who liked to show off andtried to look confident,” recalls classmate Dennis Ho. “He would go and putthose boys right.”  To any boy who wouldn’t bend to Bruce’s will, a challengewas issued. The battles took place behind the hill overlooking La Salle. “Youdidn’t have to ask Bruce twice to fight,” says Robert. In fact, you didn’t haveto ask once. He won more often than he lost, but the hypercompetitive Brucehated losing so much he refused to admit defeat. “When he lost, we’d ask him howit happened,” says Michael Lai, “and he’d always come up with excuses forhimself, because he was like the boss of everyone and needed to win.”Bruce’s chief rival was David Lee, a tough boy with whom most people didn’tmess. They battled several times. In their last contest, it got heated, and bothBruce and David pulled out their switchblades. The fight was stopped after Brucelightly cut David’s arm, drawing first blood. The injury wasn’t serious, butneither boy wanted to take their enmity any further. The use of weapons, insteadof just fists and feet, shocked the more timid sensibilities of theirmiddle-class La Salle classmates. Only the most rebellious teddy boys, likeBruce and David, carried weapons on their persons to school. Bruce owned aswitchblade, brass knuckles, and other improvised devices. “In school, ourfavorite weapon was bathroom chains used to flush toilets,” Bruce explained.“Those days, kids improvised all kinds of weapons—even shoes with razors.”With their gang life obsessions, these La Salle boys were, in their middle-classway, imitating their elders. The Triads (Chinese mafia) had been operating inthe colony since the beginning of the opium trade, but their influence didn’ttake off until after Mao Zedong’s victory in 1949. “The communists purged theTriads, so the criminals all came down to Hong Kong,” says William Cheung, afriend of Bruce’s. “A lot of kids got hooked up with them, some veryreluctantly. By 1954, they were quite established.”  The influx of hundreds ofthousands of desperate Chinese refugees, including ex-soldiers and Triadmembers, proved a volatile mix, spreading corruption and violence across theKowloon side of the colony.Another cultural shift affecting Bruce and his crew was growing Chinesenationalism. The failure of the British to defend the colony against theJapanese had shattered the myth of white superiority, and many Chinese resentedthe reestablishment of British colonial rule after the war. “The British werethe ruling class. They were the minority but they ran the city,” Bruce latertold American friends. “They lived up on the hills with the big cars andbeautiful homes, while the rest of the population, who lived below, struggledand sweat their asses off to make a living. You saw so much poverty among theChinese people that eventually it was natural to hate the filthy-rich British.They made the most money and had the best jobs because the color of their skinwas white.”After school was over, the La Salle boys engaged in an extracurricular activitythey called “Limey Bashing.” “We used to stroll along the street, looking fortrouble,” says Michael Lai. “We had much ethnic pride. We liked to beat up theBritish boys.”  The closest target was King George V (KGV), the nearby privateschool for English kids and other European expats. Bruce and his marauding bandof boys would head up the hill separating La Salle and KGV hoping to encounter agroup of British boys. Once contact was made, the taunting, insulting, andpushing would begin until tempers overcame common sense, and the fightingfinally got under way. Bruce always took the lead, punching and kicking his wayto schoolboy glory. “There were constant fights between the expats and localkids,” recalls Steve Garcia, a Eurasian classmate of Bruce’s. “They had disdainfor us.”As the boys reached puberty, KGV offered another source of attraction andopportunity for conflict: females. “They were after our girls,” says AndersNelsson, a graduate of King George V, who later had a small role in Bruce’smovie Way of the Dragon. “Of course, we went after theirs too at Maryknoll andthe other all-girl Chinese schools. There’s a Cantonese expression, ‘The localginger is not hot.’ I guess they seemed more exotic to us, being Asian girls.”It was Hong Kong’s version of West Side Story with British Jets and ChineseSharks.Image [../images/sec.jpg]After a two-year time-out from the movie industry (1951–53), Bruce’s parentsgrudgingly gave in to their son’s entreaties to revive his acting career. HoiChuen and Grace had hoped the ban would force their son to concentrate on hisstudies, but it had been in vain—Bruce’s grades and behavior only got worse, notbetter. They agreed to let the Little Dragon return to films but on the strictcondition that he behave himself. This decision was made easier by the caliberof the team Bruce was joining.In 1952, a group of the top Cantonese movie directors, actors, and writers hadset up their own production company—Union Film Enterprises, or Chung-luen inCantonese. The expressed goal of this leftist collective was to producehigh-quality, socially conscious films. “Cinema should entertain as well aseducate audiences to the ethical, to serve the community, to be patriotic, andto take pride in our cultural heritage,” explained one of its founders. Theflood of nearly a million refugees from the mainland had created a great deal ofstress, division, and hardship in the colony. The didactic message ofChung-luen’s films was the need for unity, charity, and sacrifice among theChinese people and government assistance from above. They were socialists notCommunists. “Dad was very supportive of Chung-luen’s ideals,” says Robert. “Hewas confident they would have a positive effect on Bruce’s development.”Perhaps the effect Bruce’s father was most looking to develop in his son was asense of humility and teamwork. All Chung-luen films used the same troupe of adozen or so actors, mostly adults with Bruce as the token teenage boy. In thespirit of the organization, most of their films were ensemble pieces rather thanstar vehicles. Bruce typically played secondary roles, appearing on-screen anaverage of about twenty minutes with about thirty lines of dialogue.He had one of his biggest roles in his first Chung-luen film, The Guiding Light(1953). The plot of the movie: A foster child, who is bounced from home to home,ends up on the streets until he is rescued by a doctor and his kindhearted wifewho runs an orphanage for blind girls. The doctor, whose motto is “Kids canalways be taught,” adopts the homeless boy (played by Bruce) as his apprentice.When Bruce’s character grows up, he discovers the cure for blindness. The movieends with a direct-to-camera plea: “Every child can be just like him. Poorhandicapped children are waiting for your love, for education and nurturing.”Between 1953 and 1955, Bruce appeared in ten of Chung-luen’s message-drivenmelodramas: The Guiding Light, A Mother’s Tears, Sins of the Father, Ten-MillionPeople, In the Face of Demolition, Love, An Orphan’s Tragedy, The Faithful Wife,Orphan’s Song, and Debt Between Mother and Son. These three years were the mostprolific of Bruce’s entire film career, comprising nearly half of his oeuvre.His small roles in these movies established Bruce in the public mind as acharacter actor, not a star, someone whose face they might recognize but whosename they probably couldn’t recall.Chung-luen provided Bruce with an elite education in how to make quality filmsabout serious subjects at a Hong Kong pace. Most of the film shoots lasted onlytwelve days. The company’s ideals also deeply influenced Bruce as an adultfilmmaker. He grew up wanting to make patriotic, educational movies aboutChina’s cultural heritage.The money wasn’t half bad either for a teenage boy. He earned the equivalent ofUS$2,000 per film in 2017 dollars. This started a habit he would continue hisentire life of purchasing extravagant items with his movie earnings. “After onefilm, he bought himself a little monkey. One day the monkey somehow got into thecage of our cousin Frank’s pet bird and ripped it to pieces,” says Robert. “Whenour cousin found his bird dead, he literally beat the monkey up, making themonkey so mad it bit me. My mother told Bruce the monkey had to go. Bruce didn’twant to give it up at first, but finally agreed to begrudgingly.”The artistic union of Chung-luen didn’t last long. After three years, ego andinfighting split the principals apart and the most talented dispersed to otherproduction companies. No longer part of a highly creative and prolific team,Bruce found roles more difficult to come by. He only appeared in five films inthe next five years. Without this creative outlet and structure, his teenageattention turned back to fighting and troublemaking.Image [../images/sec.jpg]After five years at La Salle, Bruce was expelled in 1956. For a respectedmiddle-class family—his father a famous stage actor, his mother a member of therichest clan in Hong Kong—this was a terrible embarrassment. The level of shamecan be measured by the degree to which the family has tried to cover up thereason. Phoebe has claimed it was his grades: “Bruce was very lazy. The schoolonly allowed students to repeat a grade once. After his first repetition, hisschool didn’t give him a second chance.” In fact, Bruce was held back twice.According to his classmates repeating a grade was fairly common and certainlynot cause for expulsion.In his biography of his brother, Robert Lee writes, “Because Bruce was simplytoo mischievous—always getting into fights and playing hooky from the time hestarted studying Wing Chun at the age of fourteen, and showing up for school inoutrageous getups—they finally threw him out.” In fact, La Salle’s attendancerecords for Bruce show he rarely if ever missed school. All evidence indicatesthat Bruce didn’t start practicing Wing Chun until after he was kicked out of LaSalle. Since the school did not have a strict dress code, outrageous getupscould not have been a reason for expulsion. And fighting was extremely commonamong the boys—Bruce had been getting into scraps with his schoolmates from themoment he entered La Salle.According to his classmates, there were two incidents in his last year at LaSalle that led to Bruce’s expulsion. The first involved the PE teacher, who allthe boys nicknamed Coolie Lo (Coolie because he had dark skin, like a peasant orunskilled laborer; Lo means “guy” or “man”). To warm up at the beginning ofclass, he made the boys run around the soccer field three times. To motivate theslackers and stragglers, Coolie Lo would hit the back of their legs. “He wouldrun with the class, staying at the end and encouraging the boys along, chanting,‘You’re too slow. Need to catch up,’ ” says classmate Pau Siu Hung.One day, Bruce, who got paddled plenty by his father at home, decided he wastired of being switched by Coolie Lo. According to Robert’s version of theevent, “There was a P.E. teacher who liked to hit the students with a ruler, aninjustice to which Bruce was not keen to submit. He gave the teacher a fearsomeglare and blocked the incoming ruler with his arm. And just like that, he was nolonger allowed to go to P.E., but had to stay in the classroom and review hislessons.”Dennis Ho, a classmate of Bruce’s, differs with Robert’s account. “He is tryingto soften the situation,” Dennis says. “To my recollection (the scene sinks intomy mind deeply), it was a long reed of grass not a ruler. I was running besideBruce or slightly behind him when it happened.” Coolie Lo whipped Bruce’s legswith the reed, and it really hurt. Bruce stopped dead in his tracks. “He put hishand in a pocket, took out his switchblade, and pointed it at Coolie Lo,” saysDennis. The Little Dragon was re-creating the scene from My Son A-Chang wherehis character pulled a knife on an adult who had hit him. “Coolie Lo turned andran away. Bruce chased after him with his knife. They ran around and arounduntil Coolie Lo fled to the principal’s office. After that, Bruce got kicked outof class.”Remarkably, pulling a knife on his teacher only got Bruce suspended from PEclass, not expelled, in part out of deference to his powerful parents. If Brucewas remorseful, he didn’t show it. While he was in suspension, he would stand bythe window and make ape movements and faces to distract the students on thefield.His schoolmates say it was another incident that finally caused him to beexpelled. “It is something we still talk about whenever we touch on the subjectof Bruce,” says Dennis Ho. According to Dennis and another classmate who wishesto remain anonymous, all the boys spent their lunchtimes messing around on thehill behind La Salle. On one particular lunch break in 1956, Bruce forced one ofthe boys to drop his pants. No one is exactly sure why Bruce focused on thisparticular boy. “Maybe Bruce wanted to show off or he was bored,” says Dennis.“He was in a mood.” After pantsing the boy, Bruce dragged out a can of red painthe had lifted from a construction site and painted the boy’s private parts red.When the boy’s parents found out what had happened, the father went to theschool’s principal and kicked up a fuss, insisting that Bruce be punished. Brucewas a terrible student, who had been held back twice. He was constantly gettinginto fights and causing trouble. He had pulled a knife on his PE teacher. Whilehe could be charming and the Catholic Brothers saw goodness in him, thisbullying prank was the final straw. Bruce was unceremoniously booted from LaSalle.It was a tremendous loss of face for his proud family. As his mother searchedfor a new school for Bruce, his frustrated father grounded him for a year—nomovie work, no nights out with friends, only school and home."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f0048-01.jpg]Ip Man and Bruce Lee practicing chi sao (sticky hands), summer 1963. (DavidTadman)"},{"pageContent":"THREEIP MANKung fu was not a popular hobby in Hong Kong when Bruce Lee was growing up. Inthe cosmopolitan colony, good society shunned the martial arts. Sophisticatesassociated it with the rural countryside, China’s feudal past, and Triadcriminality. The event that reignited interest in kung fu and made it trendy wasa challenge match in 1954 between two rivals who represented the conflictbetween tradition and Westernization, tearing at the heart of Chinese society.Wu Gongyi was the traditionalist, the fifty-three-year-old head of the Hong KongTai Chi association. Chen Kefu was the thirty-four-year-old modernizer who hadstudied White Crane kung fu, Japanese judo, and Western boxing. In a bold movefor a man of his age, it was the Tai Chi master who set the chain of events intomotion by publishing an open letter declaring his willingness to meetpractitioners of any other school “at any time and any place” for “mutual study”of the martial arts. The open challenge drew a published response from ChenKefu, which developed into a war of words that the Hong Kong tabloids eagerlyhyped. It was old versus young, past versus future, purity versus fusion, closedversus open, nationalism versus globalism.As their conflict simmered in the newspapers, a disaster rocked the colony onChristmas night of 1953. A raging fire destroyed a squatter shantytown in theShek Kip Mei area of New Kowloon, leaving 53,000 homeless. The government calledit “unquestionably the worst catastrophe the Colony has ever suffered.” Inresponse, the two combatants agreed to turn their duel into the centerpiece of acharitable relief event—“a joint exhibition of martial arts” complete with anentire evening of kung fu exhibitions and opera singing. It was scheduled to beheld in Macau, because Hong Kong colonial officials, who had fresh historicalmemories of the Boxer Rebellion, refused to sanction a martial arts duel intheir territory.A parade of celebrities, journalists, and gamblers took the ferry from Hong Kongto Macau to attend what was being hyped as the Fight of the Century. The startof the contest between the old master, Gongyi, and the younger fighter, Kefu,had all the hallmarks of an amateur match between two inexperiencedcontestants—lots of tense flailing and missing. Finally, in the middle of thefirst round, the younger fighter clocked the old master in the jaw, knocking himinto the ropes, but the older man counterpunched the young fighter hard enoughin the nose to draw a gush of blood. The judges, who were even less qualifiedthan the fighters, rang the bell early to end the round. After some cautioussparring to start the second, the younger fighter bloodied the old master’smouth, only to receive another blow to his already broken nose in response. Thesight of more gore caused the skittish judges to ring the bell early again andstop the contest. After a hurried consultation, they declared the contest at anend with no winner announced. This nondecision infuriated the audience,especially the legion of gamblers who were unable to settle their massivewagers.The silver lining of the messy, inconclusive ending was it kept the contest acentral topic of conversation for weeks. Everyone had an opinion and the debateraged. One Chinese newspaper reported, “Since the bout, everyone in Hong Kongand Macau has been discussing it with great enthusiasm, and the streets andalleys are filled with talk of the martial arts.”Almost overnight, kung fu became fashionable in the colony. Inspired by thecontest between the old Tai Chi master and the young mixed martial arts fighter,new students flooded tiny martial arts studios and took to building rooftops toparticipate in their own semiorganized bare-knuckle challenge matches—called inCantonese beimo (Image [../images/ch-10.jpg]). Young Bruce Lee, already aveteran street fighter, was drawn to the competition of these illicit rooftopcontests. This led him to a decision that would change his life. He began theformal study of kung fu.Image [../images/sec.jpg]After calling in some favors, Bruce’s mother enrolled her difficultfifteen-year-old son at St. Francis Xavier (SFX) on September 10, 1956. Comparedto La Salle, SFX was more like a reform school—its discipline stricter, theschool style more Spartan and humble. SFX’s Catholic Brothers never gave up on atroubled child and were skilled at turning them around. “Many of those boyswould have ended up on the street if not for the Brothers,” says Johnny Hung,St. Francis Xavier’s alumni chairman.The Brothers had a challenge in Bruce, because, despite promises to his parentsto amend his ways, he and his crew were still roaming the back alleys of Kowloonlooking for brawls. He won more often than he lost, but he hated losing so muchhe decided to upgrade his skills. “As a kid in Hong Kong,” Bruce recalled forBlack Belt magazine in October 1967, “I was a punk and went looking for fights.We used chains and pens with knives hidden inside. Then, one day, I wonderedwhat would happen if I didn’t have my gang behind me if I got into a fight.”Like many young toughs, the Little Dragon didn’t study the martial arts tobecome a better person but a better street fighter—not for self-defense butself-offense. “I only took up kung fu,” Bruce confided, “when I began to feelinsecure.”The first friend he made at SFX was Hawkins Cheung, who, like Bruce, was a shortscrappy kid from an upper-class home. “Being from well-to-do families, we wouldsometimes have our drivers pick up one another if we wanted to hang out for theweekend,” says Hawkins. Their friendship developed quickly and they becameclose. “Bruce’s nickname at school was ‘Gorilla,’ because he was muscular andwalked around with his arms at his sides. Everyone feared him, but I was theonly one who called him ‘Chicken Legs.’ He’d get really mad and chase me allover the schoolyard with his big upper body and chicken legs underneath.”In their after-school adventures, Hawkins and Bruce fell in with anotherneighborhood tough, William Cheung (no relation to Hawkins). The son of a policeofficer, William was older, bigger, and a much better fighter than Bruce. Theirgrowing friendship forced the Little Dragon to make a difficult decision: hecould either avoid William and maintain his status as the leader of his littlepack of SFX teddy boys or swallow his pride, hail William as “Big Brother,” andbecome one of his followers. Most alpha males are unable to subsume their egosand as a consequence never improve or grow. In contrast, Bruce cleverly chose totemporarily follow William until he had enough time to study William’stechniques and become the better fighter. In the short term, he had to besubmissive; in the long run he planned to reverse the power dynamic. Thisstrategy, which Bruce employed throughout his life, was the key to his success.He later repeated this technique with Steve McQueen in Hollywood in order tolearn how to become a movie star.Bruce discovered that William’s street talent was the result of his study of anobscure style of kung fu called Wing Chun. In China, there are hundreds ofmartial arts styles. You can walk from one village to the next and encounter ahalf dozen different masters teaching radically different systems, each with itsown mythical origin story. Wing Chun’s legend is unique because it is one of thevery few styles whose founder is a woman.When the Manchus began conquering China in the seventeenth century, the ShaolinTemple was a rebel base for the Han Chinese. It was eventually destroyed and themartial monks and nuns forced to flee. One refugee was a nun named Ng Mui, whohad developed a simplified system more suitable to the height, weight, andstrength of women. Her first student was a beautiful young girl named Yim WingChun who was being pressured by a bandit warlord into marriage. She told thewarlord she would only wed a man who could defeat her in unarmed combat.Employing the efficient techniques taught to her by the Shaolin nun, Yim WingChun dispatched the bandit with ease and the new style was named after her.Wing Chun’s growing popularity in Hong Kong was largely due to one man, Ip Man.Born in 1893 to a wealthy merchant family in Foshan, the same city where Bruce’sfather was discovered, Ip Man fled with only the clothes on his back to HongKong after the Communist takeover of China in 1949. Destitute and rumored tohave an opium habit, Ip Man began teaching Wing Chun as a way out of poverty. Hequickly acquired a coterie of angry young men, who were attracted by his talent,even temper, and quick wit.To help his students become better fighters, he taught them the basics of WingChun, which emphasizes close quarters combat—low kicks, lightning-quick shortpunches, blocks, and traps—the ideal style for fighting inside narrow alleyways.The main training technique was called chi sao (sticky hands). A form ofsensitivity training, like Tai Chi’s pushing hands, two partners touch theirforearms together and then try to block, trap, and hit their opponent whilemaintaining constant contact.To help his disciples control their rage and improve as human beings, Ip Manalso taught Taoist philosophy—“be calm like water”—and employed his sense ofhumor. “He always told me, ‘Relax! Relax! Don’t get excited!’ ” says HawkinsCheung. “But whenever I practiced chi sao with someone, I became angry whenstruck. I wanted to kill my opponent. When I saw Ip Man stick hands with others,he was very relaxed and talked to his partner. He never landed a blow on hisstudents, but he would put a student in an awkward position and make the fellowstudents laugh at the sight. He was the funniest old man. Ip Man never exhibiteda killing attitude. The students would swing their hands, and Ip Man would smileand merely control the movements.”Without telling his parents, Bruce asked William Cheung to introduce him to IpMan, who accepted the fifteen-year-old movie actor as his disciple and then senthim to learn the basics from Wong Shun Leung. (In most kung fu schools, themaster only teaches the senior students, who in turn instruct the beginners.)Twenty-one years old and a veteran of dozens of bare-knuckle beimo challengematches, Wong Shun Leung was considered the best fighter in the school and oneof the toughest in Hong Kong. His admirers called him Gong Sau Wong (Image[../images/ch-11.jpg]), “King of the Talking Hands.”The King’s first impression of the Little Dragon, who showed up sportingsunglasses and carefully coiffed hair, was not positive. “William brought in anElvis-like youngster,” says Wong Shun Leung. “His manner was very frivolous asthough he thought he was smart. After he went away, I told William that I didnot welcome this young man.” William must have given Bruce an earful, becausethe second time they met, Bruce was on his best behavior. “He dressed properlyand was more polite,” says Wong. The Little Dragon, who rebelled against mostauthority figures, had decided to once again temporarily kowtow until he couldbecome a better fighter than not only William but also Wong Shun Leung. In histypical brash and straightforward manner, Bruce did not hide his intentions. “Heasked me when he would be able to win over William and me,” recalls Wong, stillstunned by the memory. “He asked too much.”So singular was his determination to best his superiors that Bruce would play atrick on his fellow students to secure private lessons. He would make sure hewas the first to arrive at Wong Shun Leung’s apartment studio and then claim hehad something to do immediately but would return shortly. “Please wait for me!Don’t go out! I beg you, please don’t! Thank you very much!” he’d shout at Wong,before running down the stairs to wait for his classmates. When they showed upat the apartment building, he said to them, “The master has just gone out. Hisfamily said he had something important to do and will not be free. So I think wehave to see him on another day.” After that, he pushed them down the road andonto a bus, before coming back to Wong Shun Leung for his individual lesson.When Wong learned of the ruse, he couldn’t help but laugh at its cleverness. “Idid not try to persecute him,” says Wong. “That was Bruce Lee, competitive andaggressive. If he wanted anything, he would try to have it at any price.”His fellow Wing Chun brothers were not as amused. Most of them were fromworking-class backgrounds and already resented the good-looking, privilegedmovie actor. His brashness and entitled attitude only made them angrier. Some ofthem apparently went to Ip Man and called on him to expel Bruce from the school.According to William Cheung, one of the arguments they made was kung fu shouldonly be taught to Chinese, and because Bruce was Eurasian, or “mixed blood” inCantonese slang, he had to go. “They said, ‘We can’t teach Chinese kung fu to animpure Chinese,’ ” claims William. “Bruce didn’t belong to Caucasians orChinese. He was in between as he was mixed blood. At that time many Chinesepeople didn’t accept someone like that.” Ip Man refused to expel Bruce, but theLittle Dragon was encouraged to study exclusively with Wong Shun Leung and avoidthe main class until things settled down.Unable to expel him, his Wing Chun seniors knocked Bruce around during class.“These guys, some of them assistant instructors, gave me a hard time when Ifirst studied Wing Chun,” Bruce later recalled. “I was just a skinny kid offifteen.”  The hazing Bruce endured only steeled his resolve and made him moredetermined than ever to prove he was better than them. “He became fanatical,”says older brother Peter. “He practiced diligently day and night.” If Bruce waspassionate about a subject, he was an extraordinarily fast learner. He took toWing Chun like he had been born with a clenched fist. “Less than a year afterBruce had been training at the school, he had progressed so far that a lot ofthe seniors had trouble sparring or doing chi sao with him,” says William.While Bruce’s competitive spirit was extreme, it was not unique. Ip Man pittedhis students against each other. “Everyone wanted to be top dog,” says Hawkins.“We would purposely hold back information that we gathered, and not let othersknow what we learned.” Ip Man also encouraged his students to continue their“research” on the streets. “Ip Man said, ‘Don’t believe me, as I may be trickingyou. Go out and have a fight. Test it out,’ ” remembers Hawkins.After class the boys would head to the Shek Kip Mei area looking for easy marks.“We were real bad guys,” says Hawkins. “We would go up and touch or pull thetarget. If the guy was hot-tempered, he would try to push or hit us and we wouldinitiate our timing from his move. If the guy got hurt, we would say, ‘What’sthe matter with you? I was just talking to you, and you tried to hit me first,Mr. Chan.’ The target would say, ‘I’m not Mr. Chan!’ To which we would reply,‘We thought you were Mr. Chan and are very sorry we made a mistake!’ ”For Ip Man’s school it was a form of fist-to-mouth marketing. His students weredeveloping a reputation for being the baddest boys on the street. Unfortunately,it also drew the attention of the police. Bruce and Hawkins were put down on apolice list of juvenile delinquents. “Mom and Dad only realized Bruce had beenstudying Wing Chun about a year later, when they heard about him getting intoeven more trouble than before,” says Robert.Image [../images/sec.jpg]To avoid police scrutiny, the boys took to the rooftops for secret “crossinghands” matches against other rival kung fu schools. These events typicallyinvolved more bluster than brutality—serious injuries were exceedingly rarebecause the participants’ skill level was low and matches were usually stoppedas soon as anyone drew blood. They were about bragging rights and resulted inlong-standing feuds. Practitioners of Hung Gar, Choy Lay Fat, White Crane,Praying Mantis, and other popular styles gradually grew more and more resentfulof the success of upstart Wing Chun fighters.As Bruce advanced quickly in the style, it soon came his turn to take up WingChun’s mantle in a beimo challenge match. Egged on by his classmates, Brucechallenged the assistant instructor from a rival Choy Lay Fat school namedChung. He asked Wong Shun Leung to be his cornerman. On May 2, 1958, Bruce andWong Shun Leung made their way through the streets of Kowloon City to theapartment building on Union Road whose rooftop would serve as the challengesite. Wong was surprised to discover the area near the building filled withriffraff buzzing about the upcoming match. “The atmosphere was very tense andheavy as if a great thunderstorm was going to break out,” says Wong. “On ourway, many meddling youngsters pointed their fingers at us. Bruce was verydelighted. I sensed that he was very proud of himself.”As the crowd grew larger, Wong asked Bruce, “How come there are so many people?Did you tell them to come here?”Bruce denied it. “Maybe they learnt the news from the other side.”When they reached their destination, Bruce wanted to go straight up, but Wongpulled him back and said, “Walk on.”  They ducked into an alleyway and used aback entrance to fake out the crowd. Despite their precautions, twenty or thirtymeddlers were already seated on the parapet of the roof by the time Bruce andWong arrived.When Bruce’s opponent, Chung, and his crew showed up, everyone greeted eachother. Chung’s side asked Wong Shun Leung to act as the referee. He tried torebuff them—“I represent the Wing Chun school”—but they insisted, praising hisreputation for fairness. “They were so sincere that I could hardly refuse them,”remembers Wong.He called Chung and Bruce to the center of the eighteen-by-eighteen-foot rooftopfor instructions. “A match must follow rules, even if it is a friendly match.You all are young people; you are not qualified to represent your clans. Moreimportantly, this is not a duel. We have two rounds. One round will last twominutes. No matter whose side wins, the comparison will end after two rounds.This is a friendly match—you all should aim at promoting friendship. Do you bothunderstand what I mean?” Bruce and Chung nodded.Bruce stood in the center in a Wing Chun stance, left hand forward, right handslightly back. Chung circled Bruce until he saw an opening. He lunged forwardwith a roar and punched Bruce in the jaw, causing him to retreat in pain.Bruce’s mouth was covered in blood. After circling some more, Chung lunged outagain, striking Bruce in the left eye. Angry, Bruce slid forward with anaggressive series of Wing Chun chain punches, but because he was not calm hisblows did not land decisively and he left himself open to counterpunches to hisnose and cheek. As they exchanged wild swings, the timekeeper ended the round.From the damage to Bruce’s face, it was clear to everyone he had lost the firstround.“Leung!” Bruce shouted at his cornerman. “Is my eye swollen?”“Yes,” said Wong Shun Leung. “It’s bruised. Your nose is bleeding also, but it’sO.K.”“My performance today is bad,” Bruce said, shaking his head in frustration. “IfI am hurt too badly, my father will notice it. I think we better take it as adraw and end the match now.”“Bruce, if you do not continue in the second round, it means that you surrender.How can it be regarded as a draw?” Wong Shun Leung cajoled his reluctantfighter. “You are capable to fight on. Your opponent is wheezing now. If youwithdraw, you will regret it. Whether you win or not is not important, but youmust try your best. If you fight on, you will win.”“I will win?” Bruce asked, his competitive nature battling against his fear ofhumiliation. “Leung, are you sure?”“Yes,” Wong Shun Leung replied. “Why should I deceive you? Don’t worry aboutyour technique. This is a fight, not a performance. When you are close to him,step up and punch only his face. Do not worry whether you have been hit. Try toget close and attack. And be calm.”Encouraged, Bruce nodded his head to show he understood as the timekeepersignaled the beginning of the second and final round.Bruce stood in the center of the rooftop with an air of composure he lacked inthe first round. He feinted at Chung, causing him to jump back. Bruce smirked.He feinted again, making Chung jump again. Bruce grinned. The third time Brucefaked an attack, Chung stepped back only a half step while throwing a rightpunch. Seeing his opponent off balance, Bruce made use of the opening andswiftly charged forward. His left punch slammed into Chung’s face. Bruce tookanother step forward and smacked Chung with a right to the jaw so hard severalof Chung’s false teeth were knocked across the roof. Blood gushed from Chung’smouth, and his legs were wobbly as he stumbled backward. With a yell, Brucecontinued to rain heavy punches on Chung’s face. Finally, Chung fell beside thewater tank on the roof. Chung’s friends ran forward to stop the match. Severalof them criticized Wong Shun Leung for not stopping it earlier. Bruce wasoverjoyed. He raised his hands in the air in victory.As soon as he arrived home with his black eye and busted lip, Bruce went intohiding for fear his father would find out. One of the servants gave him ahardboiled egg to put on his eye to help reduce the swelling. When his littlebrother, Robert, asked if he was hurt, Bruce bragged, “These are justsurface-level wounds on me! You should have seen the other guy—I sent a few ofhis teeth flying!” In his diary, Bruce wrote, “Against Chinese boxer student ofLung Chi Chuen (4 years training). Results: Won (that guy got fainted [sic], onetooth got out, but I got a black eye).”Unable to conceal his injury from his parents for long, his father blew up. Hecursed his son for embarrassing the family and wasting his life with fighting.Phoebe recalls, “What I remember most clearly is that Bruce said to Dad: ‘I’mnot good at studying. But I’m good at fighting. I will fight to make a name.’ ”Details of the match quickly made their way back to Ip Man, whose reaction wasvery different from Bruce’s father. He pulled Wong Shun Leung aside to praisehim: “If some day Bruce achieves something in the martial arts, it is becauseyou didn’t let him quit after the first round.”Buoyed by his triumph, Bruce’s confidence and fighting spirit increased. Hebecame even more obsessed with Wing Chun. “The contest taught him that successdoes not come naturally, one had to train and fight,” says Wong Shun Leung.“Every day he practiced boxing, side kicks, wooden dummy and so on. When he hadfinished with all this, he would sit down and meditate on what he had done. Hetrained himself in this way for a long time.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]As Bruce’s skill in Wing Chun increased, he assumed the role of teacher to hisclique of followers at St. Francis Xavier. He was always practicing his moves onthe playground and instructing eager classmates during recess. Because Bruce hadbeen held back twice at La Salle, he was two years older than most of hisclassmates and they looked up to him as a “big brother.” Rolf Clausnitzer, whoseyounger brother was a schoolmate of Bruce’s, says, “One of Bruce’s favoritestunts was to stand on one leg and with the other fend off a number of‘attackers,’ pivoting as required. His speed, maneuverability, and control weresuch that it was almost impossible to close in on him without getting kicked.”Bruce’s recess lessons were noticed by the school’s sports master, BrotherEdward, a German missionary and former prizefighter. “When he came to ourschool, I knew at once he was a boxer,” says Brother Edward. “His mother camehere quite often. She wanted us to look after the boy.” Brother Edward tookBruce under his wing and encouraged him to join SFX’s newly formed Westernboxing team. He invited Bruce to put on the boxing gloves for a friendlysparring match. Using Wing Chun techniques, Bruce was able to hold his own. “Oneday there was an announcement of an inter-school boxing championship,” saysHawkins. “Bruce and I had a reputation in the school for being the naughtiest,so Brother Edward suggested that we get involved.”Every year, the two all-British private schools—King George V, which catered tothe children of British businessmen, and St. George’s, filled with the kids ofBritish military officers—held an interschool Western boxing tournament. Thisevent represented a chance for the mostly Chinese and Eurasian students of St.Francis Xavier to take their “Limey Bashing” off the streets and into the boxingring. The previous year, in 1957, only one St. Francis Xavier student hadcompeted, Steve Garcia, who won his weight class. Brother Edward convinced Bruceand another student, Ronnie, to join Steve Garcia in the 1958 tournament to beheld at St. George’s.Bruce only had a couple of months to prepare for the boxing championship.Brother Edward gave him a crash course in the basics of Western pugilism. Brucealso turned to Wong Shun Leung for instruction in how to modify his Wing Chunfor a contest that included boxing gloves and outlawed kicks. “I attacked hisweak points and guided him to make full use of his strong points,” says Wong.On March 29, 1958, about thirty teenage participants gathered in St. George’sgymnasium along with family, friends, and classmates. Except for St. FrancisXavier’s three fighters—Steve Garcia, Bruce, and Ronnie—the rest were Britishboys from King George V and St. George’s. The thirty boys were spread unevenlyin a half dozen or so weight classes. In Bruce’s group, he faced only twoopponents—a boy from St. George’s and KGV’s returning champion, Gary Elms, whohad won in his weight class the previous three years in a row. The tournamentbrackets were set by the sports masters from St. George’s and KGV. In the firstround, they matched Gary Elms against the boy from St. George’s—Bruce was givena bye to fight the winner in the finals. “Bruce was unknown and the sportsmasters thought he would be a walkover, because Gary Elms was considered thebest in that weight class,” Steve Garcia says.Rolf Clausnitzer, who attended KGV, remembers Gary not as a particularly skilledfighter but rather as a scrappy little guy, who bragged to everyone that hisuncle was a professional boxer. “Although he was considerably lighter andsmaller, that didn’t stop him from pestering me and others,” says Rolf. “I’dwrestle him to the ground, pinch his nostrils and force grass into his mouth tomake him say ‘Uncle,’ but he would never submit. As soon as I got up infrustration, he’d jump me again. He was one tough nut.”Gary easily won his first-round match in the afternoon. He and Bruce tried tokeep busy and stay focused for the next several hours until the finals in theevening. Like war, boxing tournaments consist of long periods of boredompunctuated by moments of sheer terror. During this down period, Bruce’s friend,Hawkins Cheung, engaged in a little psychological warfare: “I spoke to the champand warned him that he was facing the Gorilla now, who was an expert in kung fu,so he’d better watch out!”After all the waiting, the referee called Bruce and Gary to the center of thering and gave his instructions. The bell rang for the round to begin. Garybounced on his toes in a classic Western boxing stance. Bruce shifted to a WingChun stance. Visually it was a clash of civilizations: boxing versus kung fu.“Many foreign [British] students, male and female, jeered at Bruce,” says WongShun Leung. With his lightning speed, Bruce immediately attacked Gary’scenterline with a series of short straight Wing Chun punches to Gary’s face,bulldozing him back and dropping him to the canvas. But Gary immediately jumpedback up. Their first exchange set the tone for the next three 3-minute rounds.Bruce attacked with a series of quick but weak straight punches. Gary counteredwith a jab or two. As their bodies clashed into each other, Gary went down andthen popped back up for more. “When Bruce gradually took control of thesituation, the attitude of the spectators changed,” says Wong.Styles make fights, but rules make styles. Although Bruce was dominating thecontest, he was pushing against the limits of using Wing Chun in a Westernboxing match. Wing Chun’s short, quick, rapid straight punches were designed forbare-knuckle alley brawls. The thick padding on boxing gloves made them mostlyharmless in the ring. “There were a few knockdowns, but, because of the eightoz. gloves used, they were not that effective,” Steve Garcia says. “And some ofthe knockdowns were ruled as pushes and throws, because of the Wing Chun moves.Bruce was warned a couple of times.” While the Little Dragon could knock downhis scrappy, tough opponent, he couldn’t knock him out. “Gary was completelybaffled by Bruce’s speed and skill and had no answer for them, as he did notland one power punch on Bruce,” Rolf Clausnitzer says. “But Gary was amazinglyresilient. He was knocked down several times, but rebounded each time and didnot seem to be any worse for wear.”Friends who went to congratulate Bruce after his unanimous decision victoryexpected to find him elated. Instead, the young perfectionist was shaking hishead and looking far from pleased with himself. “Damn it, I couldn’t knock theguy out,” Bruce complained. “He kept backing away, and my punches weren’tpenetrating because of the gloves.” Bruce swore that he would redouble histraining until he could achieve the power he wanted.While Bruce would continue to fight in the streets and rooftops of Hong Kong,this was the first and last officially organized sports combat tournament hewould ever participate in. He didn’t like the way the rules constrained theeffectiveness of his techniques. As he grew older and better as a martialartist, he studiously avoided boxing and point karate tournaments. He would onlyagree, when challenged, to bare-knuckle “crossing hands” contests."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f0062-01.jpg]Margaret Leung and Bruce Lee practicing the cha-cha, circa 1957.

Peter noticed the hormonal shift by measuring the amount of time Brucespent grooming in front of the mirror: “He would spend up to 15 minutes gettinghis hair just right, making sure his tie was properly adjusted.”As Bruce turned his attention to the young ladies around him, many of themreturned the favor. He was a good-looking movie actor from a well-off familywith a reputation for being a troublemaker. That frisson of danger wrapped in arespectable upper-class package was a heady mix for the straitlaced Chineseschoolgirls of 1950s Hong Kong. It was a conservative, old-fashioned era. “Noone had sex or anything,” says Nancy Kwan, the star of The World of Suzie Wong.“It was kissing and dating and sending love notes.” Bruce’s sister Phoebe says,“Nowadays, people are not that restrained. Back then, if you held a boy’s handyou would have to bring him to your father, because when we started to holdhands, we were not that far from marriage.”The first girl in Bruce’s life was Margaret Leung. She was also a child actor(screen name: Man Lan) from a prominent film family. Her mother was a producerand her father an actor-director. Their mothers introduced the two of them whenshe was eleven and Bruce was thirteen. By all accounts, their relationship waspurely platonic: she was more of a gal-pal than a girlfriend. “Adolescent Brucewas actually very prone to feel shy in front of young women,” says Robert.“Bruce’s favorite thing to do in front of the ladies was show off his muscles.He liked to ask them to try to use their finger nails to try to pinch up a bitof fat, and when they couldn’t he’d laugh proudly.” Margaret, like Bruce, had arebellious streak and she was also a bit of a tomboy. Bruce would often teaseher by saying, “If she didn’t wear a skirt and have a figure, I’d surely treather as my sworn brother.”As they got older, they would go out to the nightclubs for dinner and dancing.“We used to go dancing at Hotel Carlton, the Shatin Inn, and the Champagne NightClub, just opposite the Miramar Hotel,” Margaret says. “The one with more moneywould pay more, but we always shared the bill.” In the mid-1950s, Hong Kong kidswere jitterbugging to clean-cut American pop like Bill Haley’s “Rock Around theClock.” Anders Nelsson, a musician who had a part in Way of the Dragon, says,“The scene was more Pat Boone than Little Richard.” It wasn’t until 1957 thatElvis Presley rolled up on Hong Kong’s shores and teens like Bruce begangreasing back their hair and gyrating in their blue suede shoes.Nights out with Bruce were fun for Margaret because he was an excellent dancerand charming company. They were also a little bit scary, because the eveningsoften ended in a brawl. When asked if she felt safe going out with a tough guylike Bruce, Margaret shrugged and smiled, “Fifty/fifty. Half because he was agood fighter. The other half because he always got into fights.” On fightnights, Margaret was not only his dance partner but also his getaway driver. “Iwas his savior,” she says. “Every time he engaged in a fight, I was alwayssomewhere nearby, waiting in my car with the engine running. He would jump in,and I’d floor it.”While Bruce and Margaret were palling around like buddies, Bruce took a romanticinterest in another young woman, Amy Chan, who would later become famous in Asiaby her film name, Pak Yan (Image [../images/ch-12.jpg]). “Neither of us had muchmoney to spend, so we went to Kowloon Tong, near where the MTR station istoday,” Amy says. “The gardens over there had trees. We would shake the trees tomake the flowers fall, yellow and white, like sandalwood flowers.” On theweekends, they often joined a larger group of friends for a “tea dance” atChungking Mansions from 4 to 6 p.m. Tea dances were the cheaper “happy hour”version of a nightclub with a less well-known singer and band.Amy remembers that Bruce was different depending on how big the group was. “Ifthere were a lot of people having a good time, then he would have an insanelygood time,” she says. “But when there were only a few people around, he was veryquiet. He would rationally analyze things and teach you things you didn’t know,like how to be a good person. But he was very masculine, extremely manly. Nomatter what he said, he was very definitive about it.”While there was a real attraction between Bruce and Amy, their relationshipdidn’t become too serious. As a teenager, Bruce seemed to have an ironicwariness of romantic attachments. When he was fifteen he wrote this playful poemabout love and relationships.Follow her she fly; fly fromher she follows.. . .Fall from a tree, fall fromabove, for heaven’s sake, don’tfall in love.If you want to know thevalue of money, try andgo to borrow some.. . .It’s better to have loved andlost, than wed and be forever bitter.The bigger they are, the harder they fall.If any one of the young women in his life could be considered Bruce’s highschool sweetheart, it was Pearl Tso. “She was the one real romance of hisyouth,” says Robert Lee. Pearl’s family and Bruce’s were extremely close. “Herdad was a friend of my father from the stage,” Phoebe says. “Pearl’s mum, EvaTso, was really close with my mum, just like sisters. She came over to our houseevery day, just to hang out.” Bruce called Eva “Auntie Tso,” and treated herlike a second mother, often confiding in her secrets he didn’t want to sharewith his parents. The two moms looked on their children’s budding romancemerrily, imagining them joining the families together in marriage. Pearl, whowas also a child movie actor, studied ballet. In part to impress her, Bruce tookup dancing. He frequently visited her home after school to “practice.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]As a teenager, Bruce’s obsession with kung fu was rivaled only by his love ofdancing. He spent many afternoons at the neighborhood “cold tea house” on JordanRoad, where customers came to drink herbal teas, listen to the jukebox, and, ifthey were young and energetic, dance. These tea shops were a place where teenageboys and girls could mingle and flirt freely. Bruce thought of dancing as a goodway to train himself not to be so shy around women.From the Lindy Hop to the boogie-woogie, from jitterbug to jive, he followed allthe latest fads, seeking to master every move. “He was good at jive,” saysDennis Ho, his classmate. “Boy was he good.” Most of these styles arrived inHong Kong from U.S. and British servicemen stationed in the colony and theHollywood movies and radio stations that catered to them. (Hong Kong was a portof call during the Korean War from 1950 to 1953.) But in 1957 a dance fadoriginating in Cuba swept its way through Latin America and then to thePhilippines before hopping over to Hong Kong. It was called cha-cha. Thisswivel-hipped, triple-stepped style—one, two, cha-cha-cha—took the colony bystorm.No one was more passionate or serious about cha-cha than Bruce Lee. “He didn’tpick it up by idly watching people at the tea house,” says Robert, “but ratherfound a Philippine woman who owned a dance studio in Tsim Sha Tsui, where shetaught wealthy women to dance cha-cha.” As part of his homework, he kept apersonal notebook of “Cha Cha Fancy Steps” that numbered over a hundred,including moves like “Banana Boat” and “Rubbing & Double.” He even invented afew of his own steps by mixing kung fu with cha-cha, creating his own crisp,fresh, and unique style.Typical of his competitive character, Bruce turned his obsession into a contestwith his friends to see who knew the most moves. “At school, I knew someFilipino friends who were pretty good, so I would pick up steps to show upBruce,” says Hawkins. “The next time I saw Bruce, he had a bunch of new steps! Ilater found out he went to my Filipino friend’s dance instructor to learn moresteps. I went to the same dance instructor and tried to persuade him not toteach Bruce.”Having bested all his friends, Bruce set his sights on a wider competition. Anambitious nightclub was sponsoring an “All-Hong Kong Cha-Cha DanceChampionship.” “He could barely wait to enter the contest,” says Robert. “Thematter he gave most thought to at the time was who should be his dance partner.”Bruce’s problem was he had too many girlfriends, so he ended up selecting as hisdance partner ten-year-old brother Robert. “By picking me, he avoided stirringup any jealousy among his female admirers.”As clever and competitive as Bruce was, he probably also had another motivationfor his choice. The Chinese are obsessed with family and worship children,especially sons. Picking his lovable little brother would appeal to the judges’sentimental hearts, giving the partners a cuteness edge in the contest. The twosiblings practiced every day for two months. “Bruce was a really great teacher,”says Robert. “Every day he’d repeat the three-minute dance for me so that I veryquickly learned it. I wasn’t nervous at all when it came time for the contest.”Robert was right not to be nervous. The adorable brothers were a lock evenbefore they stepped onto the dance floor and did their charming cha-cha routine.“Bruce was very happy,” says Robert. “He carried around the championship flaglike a photo to show all his friends everywhere he went.” Of all his youthfulaccomplishments—the boxing match, the challenge fights, the starring movieroles—he was most proud of being, as he bragged to all his friends for the restof his life, “The Cha-Cha Champion of Hong Kong.”For Bruce’s future as a martial arts movie actor, his background as a dancer wascrucial to his success. “Since they both involve physical movement and becauseyou must maintain a flow either in dancing or fighting there was, to him, arelationship,” says Linda Lee. Many great martial arts fighters have tried theirhand (and feet) at movies only to fail miserably because what works on thestreet often looks stiff and awkward on-screen. “There was a sort of innatebalance and rhythm within all his [movie] fights,” says Hong Kong film directorMichael Kaye, “and he was constantly looking for ever more complicated rhythms.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]After Chung-luen Studios disbanded in 1955, Bruce found acting work hard to comeby. As with many child actors, his teenage years were a tough transition. Tooold for scrappy, lovable orphan roles, he attempted to play against type andbroaden his range with mixed results.A cutup in class, it was natural for Bruce to try his hand at a comedy. Hisfirst and only was Sweet Time Together (1956). The film starred Sun-MaSze-Tsang, the same actor who played Li Hoi Chuen’s drug buddy in the play TwoOpium Addicts Sweep the Dike. By costarring in a comedy with Sun-Ma, Bruce wasonce again walking in his father’s shadow.In this age-reversal slapstick farce, deluded ladies’ man Sun-Ma Sze-Tsangescapes from a jealous husband by exchanging clothing with a doltish teenagerplayed by sixteen-year-old Bruce Lee. With Sun-Ma pretending to be a child andBruce an adult, they find themselves caught in increasingly absurd romanticsituations. By the closing credits, neither lover ends up with the girl of theirdesires.The only thing funny about the movie is watching the King of Kung Fu as ateenager, stammering and twitching like a fool. One of Bruce’s childhood idolswas Jerry Lewis, and Bruce does a credible imitation of the master down to thebuckteeth, white sailor boy outfit, and black horn-rim glasses.For his next big movie, Thunderstorm (1957), Bruce moved in the oppositedirection, playing a “refined gentleman” in a tragedy. His character, ChowChung, is in every way the opposite of his previous scrappy orphan roles:proper, sincere, naive, dutiful, and rich. In love with the housemaid of hiswealthy family, both he and she die when he makes a final attempt to save herfrom imminent danger.The cognitive dissonance between the refined gentleman role and his owntemperament must have affected his performance, because it is as stiff as themandarin collar he wears throughout the film. Critics panned the movie, singlingout the Little Dragon’s performance as “rigid,” “artificial,” and “over-eager.”It was a tremendous disappointment for Bruce, who had high hopes for the film.But it proved a valuable lesson: he was a much better actor when he could investhis own personality into a role.The Little Dragon had the chance in his next film, Darling Girl (1957). Itstarred his gal-pal and dance partner, Margaret Leung, and was directed by herfather in an effort to make his daughter a star. In this light romantic comedy,Margaret plays a spoiled rich girl—not a stretch for her—competing with a rivalover a guy. During a nightclub scene, Bruce has a walk-on role as a fashionabletoff, wearing a dress shirt, tie, and sweater vest. Margaret asks Bruce’scharacter to dance the cha-cha with her to make her love interest jealous. Theirdance routine has the ease and comfort of two people who have practiced togetherfor a long time. The only bit of acting required on Bruce’s part is whenMargaret’s love interest angrily confronts Bruce’s character and instead ofattacking back he flees in terror. It is the only time in life or on film thatthe Little Dragon ever ran away from a fight.Bruce didn’t appear in another film for the next three years. It was the longestbreak of his acting career since it had begun in earnest as a six-year-old. Itis not clear if the roles simply dried up after his less than stellar attemptsat playing against type or if his father banned him from making more films afterhe was expelled from La Salle and continued to get into trouble at St. FrancisXavier. What is obvious is that Bruce, like many teenage boys, was feelingincreasingly resentful of his father’s authority, especially as he watched hisold man descend deeper into opium addiction.One particularly vivid anecdote from his teenage years captures his state ofmind. “I was getting disgusted seeing old Tai Chi men putting ondemonstrations—having guys come up from the audience to punch their stomachs,”Bruce later told friends. “One day while I was watching this demonstration, Ididn’t like the way this old man smiled when the young volunteer couldn’t hurthim. When the old man asked for another volunteer, I went up. The old man,smiling, exposed his stomach as the target. But instead, I deliberately let gomy right as hard as I could towards his ribs. I heard a crack as the old mancrumbled to the floor moaning. You know I was such a smart-assed punk, I justlooked down at the old man and laughed, ‘Sorry, I missed. Next time don’t showoff.’ ”It is hard not to see this old Tai Chi street performer as a stand-in forBruce’s father.Image [../images/sec.jpg]The British colonized Hong Kong for the express purpose of selling opium to theChinese. In one of the great historical ironies, a century later colonialofficials reversed this position. Concerned with the growing number of addicts,the government established the Advisory Committee for the Prohibition of Drugsin 1959 to eradicate the damaging effects of opium on its subjects.By all accounts, the Hong Kong police force—from the Chinese beat cops at thebottom of the ladder all the way to the British officers at the top—was deeplycorrupt. The new government mandate to disrupt the opium trade was taken as anopportunity to shake down opium den owners and wealthy opium smokers, likeBruce’s father, Hoi Chuen.“A British bigwig officer showed up at our house with a bunch of underlings,pulled out all of Dad’s opium pipes and paraphernalia, spread it out on thetable, and eloquently held forth about how British law did not permit thesmoking of opium, and so on,” remembers Robert. “Actually, he had only one goal,which was money, but he couldn’t come right out and say that, so he would justput you in an awkward position until you coughed up enough to satisfy him. Momfinally gave him five-hundred dollars, which, at the time, was enough to feedthe ten of us for several months.”The humiliation, the embarrassment, the loss of face was too much for a proudman like Hoi Chuen to take. It was his rock bottom. “After that, Dad made thedecision to quit smoking,” says Robert, “after years of persistent urging frommy mother.”Few classes of drugs are more addictive or have more painful withdrawal symptomsthan opioids. In the first day, the addict suffers muscle aches, runny nose,sweats, fever, racing heart, anxiety, and insomnia. By the third day, it turnsinto stomach cramps, diarrhea, vomiting, depression, and terrible drug cravings.Hoi Chuen detoxed at home using the time-honored Chinese method—tapering off hisdrug consumption by drinking rice wine spiked with small pieces of cooked opiumfor a week before finally quitting cold turkey. “It was very difficult for himto stop,” Phoebe recalls. “He had diarrhea often.” After this brutal ordeal, HoiChuen never touched opium again.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Having dealt with the father’s drug addiction, the family turned to confrontBruce’s problem with violence. He had come up with a new way to start fights andtest out his Wing Chun. Ever the actor, he would dress up in a traditionalChinese costume—mandarin collar, flowing robe—and wander around the streets witheveryone else in Western-style clothing. Standing out like a sore thumb, hewaited for someone to make a joke or stare at him for too long. “What are youlooking at? Do I look weird or something?” Most would shy away and apologize.Bruce used those who didn’t as punching dummies.In corrupt, Triad-infested Hong Kong, the police had higher priorities than arambunctious teen picking fights. But in 1959, the inevitable happened. Heroughed up a teenager with powerful parents. They demanded action from thepolice. The police went to Bruce’s school and confronted St. Francis Xavier’sheadmaster, who called in his mother. The cops said, “Hey, either your son stopswhat he is doing or we will have to arrest him, because we just can’t let him goout there and pick fights all day long.”When his terrified mother arrived home, she explained the situation to herhusband. “No good! He can’t go on like this!” his father shouted. Grace pulledher eighteen-year-old son aside for a serious talk about his future. Nothing hisparents had tried could convince Bruce to stop fighting. If he stayed in HongKong, he would likely end up in jail. The movie roles had dried up. He could notmake a living with one or two small parts a year in low-budget flicks. He alsohad no chance of attending one of Hong Kong’s highly selective universities. Itwas unlikely he would even graduate from high school. His report card from St.Francis Xavier ranked him forty-one out of forty-two students, and noted hisconduct was “very poor.”But Bruce Jun Fan Lee had the unique advantage of being an American citizen. Ifhe returned to the land of his birth, he could attend a remedial high school andget his diploma. He might even get into a local college and only have to payin-state tuition. As with millions of immigrants before him, America representeda fresh start, a chance for a new beginning. He was heading down a dark road inHong Kong. The change in environment might do him good.There was one final reason the move made sense. At the time, every American malewas required by law to register for the military draft when he turned eighteen.Bruce either had to sign up or give up his U.S. citizenship.Despite the clear logic, Bruce understandably didn’t want to leave his friendsand family. It felt like punishment, like he was being sent away, cast off,banished. “Bruce didn’t want to go, but his father forced him,” says Hawkins.“Bruce feared his father and had to comply.” Phoebe says, “Dad’s intuition wasto let him ‘eat bitter’ [suffer] in the U.S.”After the initial indignation and resentment began to recede, Bruce started tosee his situation from his parents’ perspective. He realized he needed adramatic change of setting. “He told me once that if he had stayed in Hong Kong,he probably would have joined a gang and been knifed to death,” says Nancy Kwan.By nature, Bruce was optimistic and independent. The trip to America wasbeginning to feel like an adventure. He started planning in detail for hisfuture life. First, he needed to clear his name. “Prior to any Hong Kongresident leaving for a new country, you had to check with the police station tomake sure your record was clean,” says Hawkins. “Bruce applied for thiscertificate, and found that our names were on a blacklist of known juveniledelinquents. He called me at home. ‘Hawkins, big trouble,’ Bruce exclaimed. ‘Ournames are on a known gangster list. I’m going down to the police station toclear my name, and while I’m there, I’ll clear yours, too.’ I thanked him. A fewdays later, a police investigator came to my house and questioned me about gangrelations. Bruce’s efforts to clear me actually got me more in trouble. Myfather had to pay off this investigator to have my name wiped from the record,or else I wouldn’t have been able to attend college in Australia. I hated Brucefor that!”Next Bruce turned his mind to his future profession. In a journal entry fromNovember 30, 1958, he wrote, “Now I try to find out my career—whether as adoctor or another? If as a doctor, I must study hard.” His heart was set on ajob in the medical field. Besides doctor, he also considered becoming apharmacist. In one of his earliest English-language letters, also dated November1958, he reached out to a family friend attending medical school to ask for hisadvice: “I intend to study medicine or pharmacy in the future. As I am ignoranton that subject, can you please explain to me the qualification of being adoctor or pharmacist step-by-step? Do you think I can succeed when, at present,I don’t know anything about it?”Since the reply letter is lost, it is unknown what advice Bruce received.Whatever it was, it seemed to change his mind. He began toying with the idea ofdental school. His friends found it hilarious that the same boy who was anexpert in knocking out teeth wanted to fix them. “I cracked up and laughed inhis face!” says Hawkins. “ ‘You, a dentist?’ I said. ‘Your patients would loseall their teeth.’ ”While he was studying medicine or pharmacy or dentistry in America, Bruce knewhe would need a way to support himself. His father had promised to pay for hisexpenses in the U.S., but Bruce, whose pride was still wounded by hisbanishment, didn’t want his father’s help. He wanted to be independent. To makemoney on the side, he planned to teach Wing Chun. “I replied that he didn’t havemuch to teach at the time,” says Hawkins. “We had both only learned up to thesecond Wing Chun form.”Bruce decided it would be useful to pick up a flashy kung fu style to impresspotential American students. One of his father’s close friends, Master Shiu HonSang, was an expert in northern kung fu, known for its acrobatic leaps and highkicks. “Bruce learned northern style for showmanship,” says Hawkins. The dealwas Master Sang would teach Bruce his fancy forms in return for Bruceinstructing him in cha-cha. Bruce went to Master Sang’s kung fu club everymorning at 7 a.m. for two months to exchange lessons. Master Sang later jokinglycomplained it turned out to be a bad deal for him: Bruce was such a fast learnerhe mastered the movements of several complex forms, while Master Sang neverquite got the hang of the basic cha-cha steps.His parents had hoped that America would change Bruce, but it was the verdict tosend him away that transformed him from a teenage punk into a more mature andsober young man. “After this decision was made, Bruce suddenly changed,” saysRobert. “Mr. ‘Never Sits Still’ suddenly decided to calm down and even to takehis studies seriously. He would often stay home for long hours doing homeworkand reviewing his courses of his own accord.” In his diary entry for December 1,1958, Bruce wrote, “Spent more time on Math and English (especiallyconversation).”  The change in Bruce’s behavior was so dramatic his parents atfirst believed he must have gotten into some serious mess again. Seeing her sonat home studying made his mother so uneasy she called his school to see if hewas in trouble. Only after his father took the time to have a long conversationwith Bruce did his parents finally realize their wayward son was becoming moremature.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Across cultures, the martial arts have served three basic purposes: warfare(combat, street fighting), sports (boxing, MMA), and entertainment (stagecombat, pro wrestling, kung fu movies). Eastern martial arts added a fourthcategory: spiritual practice. Kung fu was understood to be a method of movingmeditation. Its deepest goal was to lead its adherents toward enlightenment.As Bruce was rounding out his martial arts skills with flashy northern kung fuin the mornings, he continued his study of the practical Wing Chun in theafternoons. Wong Shun Leung instructed him in the physical aspects, while Ip Mangave guidance on the psychological and philosophical dimensions. It was Ip Man’swise instruction that led to a transformative spiritual epiphany. Two yearslater in 1961, Bruce recounted the experience in a remarkably insightful collegeessay.About four years of hard training in the art of gung fu, I began to understandand felt the principles of gentleness—the art of neutralizing the effect of theopponent’s effort and minimizing expenditure of one’s energy. All this must bedone in calmness and without striving. It sounded simple, but in actualapplication it was difficult. The moment I engaged in combat with an opponent,my mind was completely perturbed and unstable. Especially after a series ofexchanging blows and kicks, all my theory of gentleness was gone. My onlythought left was somehow or another I must beat him and win.My instructor, Professor Ip Man, would come up to me and say, “Relax and calmyour mind. Forget about yourself and follow the opponent’s movement. Let yourmind do the counter-movement without any interfering deliberation. Above all,learn the art of detachment.”That was it! I must relax. However, right there I had already done somethingcontradictory, against my will. That was when I said I must relax, the demandfor effort in “must” was already inconsistent with the effortlessness in“relax.” When my acute self-consciousness grew to what the psychologists called“double-blind” type, my instructor would again approach me and say, “Preserveyourself by following the natural bends of things and don’t interfere. Remembernever be in frontal opposition to any problem, but control it by swinging withit. Don’t practice this week. Go home and think about it.”The following week I stayed home. After spending many hours in meditation andpractice, I gave up and went sailing alone in a junk. On the sea, I thought ofall my past training and got mad at myself and punched at the water. Right thenat that moment, a thought suddenly struck me: Wasn’t this water the essence ofkung fu? I struck it just now, but it did not suffer hurt. Although it seemedweak, it could penetrate the hardest substance in the world. That was it! Iwanted to be like the nature of water.I lay on the boat and felt that I had united with Tao; I had become one withnature. The whole world to me was unitary.This mystical moment had a profound effect on the young man. Kung fu became hisreligion, his path to enlightenment. He became intensely interested in Taoism,the ancient Chinese philosophy that focuses on being one with nature, going withthe flow, bending like a reed in the wind—“Be water, my friend,” as Bruce wouldlater famously say. He was self-aware enough to realize many of his problemswere the result of his need to be in control, to assert his will. He was adragon, a fire element—his anger burning those around him. Taoism and kung fuserved as a psychological self-corrective, water to douse the flames.The joke in China is kung fu is a way to trick thirteen-year-old boys intomeditating. Bruce had started his martial arts path as a punk. From this instantforward, he would speak and think more and more like a Taoist monk. Thisinternal dichotomy and conflict between his punkish personality and monkishinsights would define his adult life.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Ironically, just as preparations for him to leave Hong Kong were nearly completethe Little Dragon was offered one of the best movie roles of his life. Eversince he starred in the film My Son A-Chang (1950), he had been waiting foranother leading role. After nine years of playing secondary parts, he finallyhad his chance in The Orphan. The plot was a familiar one for Bruce: Hischaracter, Ah Sum, orphaned during the war, becomes a pickpocket for a streetgang. He is caught and given a choice: jail or school. He takes school, andunder the guidance of a kindhearted principal slowly reforms himself. When hisold gang tries to strong-arm him into one last raid, he refuses and they cut offhis ear.The update to this shopworn story line is Bruce’s performance. Too old to playscrappy but lovable street urchins, he instead makes his character, Ah Sum,emotionally unhinged and psychologically wounded. One moment he is snarling, thenext laughing manically, and all the while spewing out a fetid stew of Cantonesestreet slang. While he clearly fashioned the role after another one of hisscreen idols, James Dean (The Orphan is Hong Kong’s version of Rebel Without aCause), he brought in elements from his own roguish life. Whenever theschoolmaster tries to reach out to help him, Bruce’s character ignores him bybreaking into an elaborate cha-cha routine. After a female teacher inadvertentlyinsults him, he pulls a switchblade and threatens her. This confrontation leadsto perhaps the most realistic fight scene of his career when several of hisclassmates awkwardly try to wrestle the knife out of his hand and they all endup falling over each other.The Orphan was both a critical and commercial success. A leading film critic atthe time, Ting Yut, exalted Bruce’s performance in bringing the lead characterto life. Opening on March 3, 1960, in an unprecedented eleven theaters, the filmbroke the previous box office record, grossing more than HK$400,000 in its firstrun. It also became the first Hong Kong movie to break into the internationalmarket. It was shown at the Milan Film Festival.Teenage boys were so taken with Bruce’s swaggering portrayal of Ah Sum—thegangster who defied authority, battled against his teacher, and turned hisschool upside down—that they began to emulate the way he smoked cigarettes andcha-cha danced. One concerned high school principal felt the need to hang abanner across the school’s entrance reading: “No one is allowed to imitateLittle Dragon Lee’s Ah Sum in The Orphan!”Image [../images/sec.jpg]In the week before he left, Bruce and his sister Agnes went to an oldfortune-teller to find out his fate in America. The crone told him what sheundoubtedly repeated to thousands of other anxious clients: someday he would berich and famous. “We laughed about it,” says Agnes, “but I always felt it wasgoing to happen.” Despite this auspicious prophecy, Bruce’s stomach twisted inknots as the day of departure approached. “The night before he left, when I hadalmost fallen asleep, he came into my room, sat by my bed, and said, ‘I’m goingto leave for America to study. I don’t know what it’s going to be like overthere,’ ” recalls Robert. “I understood his sighs—he was afraid, and didn’t knowwhat his future would hold.”On the afternoon of April 29, 1959, Bruce headed to Victoria Harbor. His parentsbought him a one-way ticket on the SS President Wilson, a high-end ocean liner,for the eighteen-day voyage to San Francisco. He was joined by several of hisfriends and most of his family. One person missing was his father, Hoi Chuen.“We people of Shunde County have an old custom—a father can’t see off his son ona voyage,” says Robert. One imagines him pacing at home—a swirling mix of anger,guilt, disappointment, remorse, and hope—wondering if he had made the rightdecision and if he would ever see his second son again. At the dock, Bruce’smother, Grace, gave him US$100 for expenses and a warning: Unless he madesomething of himself, he was not to come back. Bruce promised to behave and onlyreturn “when I’ve made some money.”As the boarding horn blew, Bruce hugged his family, friends, and girlfriend,Pearl. “After many years of being as close as twins, we would be apart for thefirst time,” says Hawkins. One dear friend who couldn’t make it was his dancepartner, Margaret Leung. She was in the hospital for a minor operation. “Heasked someone to send me a note. Bruce wrote: ‘I hope the doctor cuts you intwo,’ ” Margaret says, laughing at the memory. “What a jerk!” Bruce promisedPearl he would write her frequently. His eleven-year-old brother handed him acard: “To dearest Bruce, Please don’t be sad in the ship. From your lovingbrother, Robert.” Bruce kept the note his entire life.It was customary for passengers leaving on long journeys to buy several rolls ofribbons. Once on deck, they would hold one end and toss the rolls down to theirfamily and friends remaining on the docks. Both sides would hold on to each endof the ribbon until the boat had pulled far enough away to stretch the ribbon toits limits and it broke. “On the ship, he threw five or six ribbons to us,” saysRobert. “Me and my sisters caught them and saw the ship depart.” Watching Brucewave goodbye, Hawkins says, “I saw him cry.” When the ribbons broke, his motherwept uncontrollably. Bruce was out of sight, heading off to an unknown future onthe other side of the world."},{"pageContent":"ACT IIGOLD MOUNTAINDaddy has gone to Gold MountainTo earn money.He will earn gold and silver,Ten thousand taels.When he returns,We will build a house and buy farmland.—Cantonese nursery rhyme, circa 1850"},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f0082-01.jpg]Bruce Lee outside Ruby Chow’s restaurant in Seattle, circa 1960. (David Tadman)"},{"pageContent":"FIVENATIVE SONAfter gold was discovered at Sutter’s Mill in California in 1848, miningcompanies searched the world for a compliant workforce. With the gradualabolition of African slave labor, coolie traders in southern China, like Bruce’sgreat-grandfather, offered an alternative source. Using deceptive promises ofquick riches and clever marketing—California became known in Chinese as Jinshan(Gold Mountain)—they signed Chinese peasants to coercive contracts and shippedthem across the Pacific. From 1850 to 1852, the number of Chinese in Californiarose from 500 to 25,000.When the gold ran dry, this cheap labor force was hired to build the CentralPacific Railroad in 1863. The Chinese became to the West what the Negro was tothe South and the Celt to the East. From the perspective of Californiabusinessmen, the Chinese were ideal employees: as guest workers underexploitative contracts and aliens ineligible for citizenship, they were willingto work harder for less money and less likely to organize or strike than theirEuropean immigrant counterparts. “They are quiet, peaceable, tractable, freefrom drunkenness,” wrote Mark Twain. “A disorderly Chinaman is rare, and a lazyone does not exist.”In contrast, white working-class immigrants, especially the Irish, saw thequiet, tractable Chinese as unwanted competition and set about finding ways toeliminate these men, who they called “Nagurs,” “Celestials,” and “Moon-eyedLepers.” Instead of seeking common ground, the American labor movement ralliedEuropean-immigrant workers against the Chinese, declaring in 1870: “We areinflexibly opposed to all attempts on the part of capitalists to cheapen anddegrade American labor by the introduction of a servile class of laborers fromChina.”Whereas Chinese workers were once praised, they were now vilified. The DailyAlta California editorialized: “The Chinese are morally a far worse class tohave among us than the Negro. They are idolatrous in their religion—in theirdisposition cunning and deceitful, and in their habits libidinous and offensive.They can never become like us.” Chinatowns began to be portrayed as dens ofinequity, filled with opium and prostitution. As the American economy descendedinto the “Long Depression” of the 1870s, the exploding population of Chinese onthe West Coast was seen as a threat. By the early 1880s, it had grown to370,000—representing one quarter of the entire able-bodied labor force. Darkconspiratorial talk arose of the “Yellow Peril”—the fear that an Asiatic hordewould descend on the New World and overwhelm the white majority.In 1881, the anti-Chinese anger of the white working class moved congressionallawmakers to propose the Chinese Exclusion Act. It was the first time the nationhad ever seriously considered banning an entire immigrant group based on race,ethnicity, or country of origin. “Why not discriminate?” asked Californiasenator John F. Miller. “America is a land resonant with the sweet voices offlaxen-haired children. We must preserve American Anglo-Saxon civilizationwithout contamination or adulteration from the gangrene of Orientalcivilization.” President Chester A. Arthur vetoed the bill, fearful of how itmight affect trade with China. The public erupted in anger. Across the West thepresident was hanged in effigy, his image burned by enraged mobs. A compromisebill was introduced the next year barring all Chinese laborers. It passed andwas signed by President Arthur.Instead of dampening passions, the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act inflamed them.Banning new Chinese was not enough, they all had to go. White vigilantessubjected Chinese communities to a period of genocidal violence and terror knownas “the Driving Out.” In Seattle in 1885, a mob forced most of the Chineselaborers to leave town. Six hundred Chinese merchants who refused to abandontheir goods were rounded up by force and herded to the Northern Pacific Railroadtrain station, built by Chinese sweat, and shipped to Portland. The secretary ofwar had to dispatch troops to Seattle to stop more anti-Chinese pogroms.For the next sixty years, the Chinese in America were marginalized andghettoized in their Chinatowns—a distrusted, despised, and discriminated againstminority. The turning point was Pearl Harbor. Suddenly, 120,000 JapaneseAmericans were rounded up and sent to internment camps, while the Americanattitude toward China underwent a dramatic enemy-of-my-enemy change. Almostovernight the backward and semi-colonized country of China became a valuableally, and its people hailed as heroic freedom fighters. To prevent China fromsurrendering to the Japanese and keep them fighting on America’s side, PresidentFranklin Roosevelt sent a letter on October 11, 1943, urging Congress to “be bigenough to correct a historic mistake,” and “silence the distorted Japanesepropaganda” by repealing the Chinese Exclusion Act.After the war was over, the need for more scientists, engineers, and doctors ledto further liberalizations of immigration law and exceptions for skilledworkers. The result was a second great wave of Chinese immigrants—mostly highlyeducated “Uptown Chinese” from Taiwan and Hong Kong. While the first wave hadled to the “Yellow Peril” fear of Chinese immigrants, the second wave causedwhite America to hold up the Chinese as a “model minority,” capable, as U.S.News & World Report declared in 1966, of “winning wealth and respect by dint ofits own hard work.”On a passenger liner in the middle of the Pacific Ocean in 1959, Bruce Lee waspart of this second wave. Educated, well-to-do, and already an American citizen,his success would fundamentally alter the perception of the Chinese in America.Image [../images/sec.jpg]However disappointed Bruce’s parents might have been in their son, they madeevery effort to ease his journey to a strange land. When Bruce’s ship made itsfirst port of call in Osaka, Japan, on May 4, 1959, the first face he saw on thedock belonged to his older brother, Peter, who was studying in Tokyo. “He tookme on the train from Osaka directly to Tokyo for sightseeing,” Bruce wrote to afriend. He was shocked at how much more advanced Tokyo was than Hong Kong. “It’sas pretty as any Western country. I’ve never seen so much automobile traffic.The city is full of excitement. Hong Kong falls way behind!” His initialimpression was the seed for Bruce’s lifelong admiration for and envy of theJapanese.When his ship docked in Honolulu on May 17, Bruce was greeted by two CantoneseOpera actors—friends of his father. They introduced him to a wealthy Chinesebenefactor, Mr. Tang. “He and I hit it off right away, like we’d known eachother forever,” Bruce wrote. “He studies Hung style boxing and loves theNational Art. He envies my skill and knowledge of Wing Chun and hopes that I canstay longer in Hawaii to teach him boxing, and to find a school for me to teachat.” As a welcoming gesture to the young man, Mr. Tang invited the group to thefinest Chinese restaurant in Honolulu. Bruce marveled: “One bowl of shark finsoup is already US$25! I think after eating it for the first time I, myself,will never have any opportunity to eat another US$25 gourmet dish again.”The ever-gregarious Bruce made a number of friends on the ship. “There were twoAmericans who live in our cabin room. Both are studying law. We chit-chatted,”Bruce wrote. “I also met my school friend’s older brother, Mr. Chang. Webasically did everything together. This person studies Choy Lay Fut boxing andhas definite interest and admiration for Wing Chun.” He even befriended andimpressed the ship’s band members, who asked him to teach a cha-cha class to thefirst-class passengers. “After I taught for 15 minutes, there came a life savingdemonstration. Everybody had to go below deck and put on their life-jackets.This is very bothersome!”Despite his extroverted personality and his family’s best efforts, it was stilla lonely journey filled with intense feelings of anxiety and loss. “DearestPearl, after our departure I miss you very much,” the heartsick young man wroteto his high school sweetheart. “At night I can’t sleep and I take out all thephotos which you gave me and look at them over and over again. I love you.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]On May 17, 1959, eighteen years after departing America, Bruce “Reverberate SanFrancisco” Lee returned to his birthplace. Dressed in a sharp dark suit, lighttie, and sunglasses, Bruce was met at the docks by Quan Ging Ho, a friend ofBruce’s father. He had worked at the Mandarin Theatre (since renamed the SunSing Theatre) when Hoi Chuen was performing in San Francisco in 1940. The planwas for Bruce to stay with Mr. Quan over the summer until he moved to Seattle inthe fall to finish his high school education.As they walked from the docks, Mr. Quan served as an excited tour guide to SanFrancisco’s Chinatown, the neon-lit, colorfully painted neighborhood hemmed inbetween the financial district to the south, the dockworkers along the bay tothe east, the Italian neighborhood to the north, and the financial elite of NobHill to the west. One can only imagine the disorientation Bruce must have feltstaring at this miniature simulacrum of Hong Kong with its Chinese grocerystores, chop suey restaurants, gaudy gift shops, and ornate theaters—so much thesame and yet everything just a bit off.Bruce arrived at Mr. Quan’s tiny apartment at 654 Jackson Street to discover hisaccommodation was a single bed squeezed in the corner of the main room betweenother pieces of furniture. The bathroom and kitchen, located down a narrowhallway, were shared with the residents of the other units. Although his livingconditions in Hong Kong with thirteen other family members had been cramped,this space was depressing and claustrophobic. At least at home there wereservants. Bruce was experiencing the shock of going from Third World rich toFirst World poor.Mr. Quan found work for Bruce as a waiter at the Kum Hom Restaurant just acrossthe street from their apartment. Bruce, who had never previously held a jobother than movie actor, quickly proved unsuited for the service industry andlasted barely a week. A better fit for his personality proved to be teaching—itallowed him to display his charm and demonstrate his talent. What the Bay AreaChinese community wanted to learn from a handsome eighteen-year-old fresh offthe boat was not the ancient art of kung fu, but the newest steps of the dancecraze cha-cha.His dance classes took place at the KMT Building, the Claremont and LeamingtonHotels, and numerous association halls in San Francisco and Oakland. “There were30 of us and Bruce charged one dollar a person,” remembers Harriet Lee, one ofhis dance students. “He showed us some very different cha-cha moves than we wereused to. Everyone liked him. He told very funny jokes. He was a pureentertainer.”During intermission in his cha-cha classes, Bruce would dazzle his students withWing Chun performances. One of the people stunned by Bruce’s talent was GeorgeLee, a forty-year-old machinist from Alameda: “I had never seen anyone as fastas he was. Heck, I never dreamed anyone could be that fast.”George pulled Bruce aside after the class was over and breathlessly asked, “Whatstyle was that?”“Wing Chun,” Bruce beamed.“I have been training in gung fu for the past 15 years and I’ve never seenanything like what you are doing,” George said. “What are your plans?”“I’m moving to Seattle for school.”“Well, when you are back this way, I would like to get a group and have you forour instructor.”As the fall semester approached, Peter arrived in San Francisco to help Brucemove and make certain, on behalf of the family, that his younger brother was notin any trouble. Afterward Peter planned to travel east to the University ofWisconsin where he had gained admission. It was quite an honor—only the mostelite Hong Kong students were accepted to American universities. Peter would goon to earn a PhD in physics and become a respected scientist at Hong Kong’sRoyal Observatory.Peter found Bruce to be as outwardly buoyant and confident as before. By allmeasures, his summer in the Bay Area had been put to good effect. He hadreaffirmed his legal identity as an American citizen by acquiring a driver’slicense and registering for the draft. His cha-cha teaching gig had put somespending money in his pocket and the praise he received for his kung fu skillshad given him an inkling of an alternative career path.But beneath the bravado Bruce’s subconscious was unsettled. “We slept togetherin an old double bed,” Peter says. “Every once in a while Bruce would be takenwith a dream and start punching and yelling, and once, literally tore hispajamas apart as he punched and kicked out in a violent demonstration. Then he’dstart kicking and throwing his covers off us before settling back for the restof the night. He was tight and tense even in his sleep.”Bruce had reason for concern. In Seattle, he was going to face two things thathad tripped him up before: school and a stern authority figure.Image [../images/sec.jpg]When Bruce’s father, Li Hoi Chuen, toured America, one of his closest friends inthe opera troupe, Ping Chow, became gravely ill in New York City. He was nursedback to health by a young Chinese American woman named Ruby. Born on a Seattlefishing dock, Ruby was the eldest daughter in a family of ten children. Herfamily was so poor that her brothers would knock on the back doors of Chinatownrestaurants and ask for leftover food. Strong-willed and unyielding from anearly age, Ruby divorced her first husband and moved to Manhattan where she fellin love with Ping Chow.They married, returned to Seattle, and opened the first Chinese restaurantoutside Chinatown. They chose a large three-story home on the corner of Broadwayand Jefferson in the First Hill neighborhood. Many Chinese laughed at Ruby andsaid she would never make it up there, but her restaurant soon became a hangoutfor white CEOs, politicians, and journalists. Ping, who spoke little English,was the cook, while the loquacious Ruby transformed her job as hostess into akind of unofficial spokeswoman for the Chinese community. When the Chinese had aproblem with the city, its police, or immigration officials, they went to Ruby.Police would come to her to arbitrate neighborhood conflicts in Chinatown. Overthe years, she housed hundreds of Chinese immigrants searching for a new life inthe rooms above her restaurant.As the son of one of Ping Chow’s oldest friends, Bruce was under the impressionhe would be treated like an honored guest with no more serious responsibilitiesthan occasionally babysitting Ruby’s youngest son, Mark. Instead Ruby put him ina tiny forty-square-foot bedroom—formerly a walk-in closet under the staircasewith one naked bulb, a wooden fruit box for a desk, and peeling plaster fordecor—and promptly assigned him the most menial tasks as the restaurant’sbusboy, dishwasher, janitor, scullion.It was exactly what Bruce’s father wanted. Hoi Chuen had sent his son to Americato “eat bitter.” Having grown up poor, he believed that suffering builtcharacter, and his wife, who was raised in Hong Kong’s wealthiest clan, hadspoiled the boy. His son needed a wake-up call, a reality check. Bruce wroteHawkins, “Now I am really on my own. Since the day I stepped into this country,I didn’t spend any money from my father. Now I am working as a waiter for a parttime job after school. I’m telling you it’s tough, boy!”While his father had cut Bruce off, his mother, Grace, secretly sent money toRuby to help with his upkeep, pad his paycheck, and prevent Ruby from evictingBruce. Grace knew her son well. He might be trapped in a walk-in closet andforced to clean dishes, but he didn’t have to like it. Bruce made hisdispleasure known by refusing to give Ruby Chow face. In Chinese culture,younger people are expected to address their elders either formally or with afamilial appellation, like “Uncle” or “Auntie.” As a form of protest, Brucesimply called her “Ruby,” an appalling breach of etiquette.“You should call me ‘Mrs. Chow’ or else ‘Auntie Chow,’ ” she reprimanded him.“You’re not my auntie,” Bruce shot back, “so why should I call you ‘Auntie’?”His insolent attitude toward his elders—what is called in Cantonese “not thick,nor thin”—provoked one of the cooks into threatening Bruce with a cleaver. “Useit,” Bruce yelled at the cook. “Take a swing. I dare you.” Other employeesintervened, forcing the cook to back down.Bruce complained to anyone who would listen, including Ruby Chow, that he was avictim of exploitation, an indentured servant. He declared his situation themodern equivalent of the coolie trade. Ruby disliked Bruce and detested hiscriticism. “He was not the sort of person you want your children to grow uplike,” she later said. “He was wild and undisciplined. He had no respect.”For the three years that Bruce cleaned dishes and lived above Ruby’s restaurant,their relationship was one of open hostility. He called her “the dragon lady.”But despite his resistance, Ruby gave structure to Bruce’s life. By the time heleft her service, he had been transformed from a spoiled street punk intosomeone intent on making something of himself.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Every morning Bruce walked down Broadway to attend Edison Technical High Schoolon 811 East Olive Street. It offered vocational training and adult education toolder students, many former military in their mid-twenties, who wanted tocomplete their high school education or pick up a trade. With a purpose anddrive he lacked in Hong Kong, Bruce forced himself to grind through his math andscience courses and found himself actually enjoying history and philosophy. Henever became an academic whiz, like his brother, but he maintained a 2.6 gradepoint average and graduated with a high school diploma in eighteen months, afeat his family would have considered impossible only a few years prior.During his first few months in Seattle, his main extracurricular activity wasthe Chinese Youth Club. He joined because the head instructor, Fook Young, wasone of his father’s friends and Bruce looked on him as an uncle. Uncle Fook waswell versed in several styles of kung fu and taught Bruce the basics of PrayingMantis, Eagle Claw, and Tai Chi. When Bruce left Hong Kong, he had only threeyears of training in Wing Chun and considered himself to be the sixth-beststudent in Ip Man’s school of several dozen disciples. His greatest desire wasto improve so much that he would be number one when he returned to Hong Kong.His problem was nobody in America practiced the relatively obscure style of WingChun. While he was away, his classmates would be getting better and better. Toshortcut their advantage, he decided to search out the secrets of other kung fustyles to combine them into a super-system. He wanted to become the best kung fuartist in the world.The Chinese Youth Club was where Bruce practiced his other greatpassion—dancing. He was committed to kung fu, but he often felt that cha-cha wasmore fun. “I don’t do much for my spare time except studying and practicing WingChun,” he wrote to his friend Hawkins. “Now and then a South American will comeand teach me some of his terrific fancy steps and have mine in return. His stepsare really wonderful and exotic!” Bruce’s dueling obsessions were obvious justfrom looking at his hands: his right was enlarged and heavily callused frompounding his knuckles against wooden dummies but his left was slender andunmarred. “I’m saving it for dancing,” Bruce joked with friends.Bruce Lee’s first public performance in America was at the 1959 Seattle Seafair.Billed as a kung fu exhibition, the announcer informed the crowd that the showwould be delayed for a cha-cha demonstration. Onto the stage sashayed Bruce anda young female partner. They gracefully danced through twenty different routinesuntil the crowd grew restless. Next up were the kung fu routines from theChinese Youth Club. The first to perform was a two-hundred-pounder doing apowerful traditional form as the announcer explained each technique and itspurpose. The last person to demonstrate was Bruce Lee, who the announcerintroduced as just arriving from California. He did a beautiful Southern PrayingMantis form filled with intricate hand movements, which he emphasized by poppinghis knuckles.The most excited and dazzled member of the audience was a young African Americannamed Jesse Glover. As a boy growing up in Seattle, Jesse became obsessed withthe martial arts after a drunken, racist cop shattered his jaw with anightstick. Jesse wanted revenge, but he couldn’t find any Asian instructor whowould teach a black teenager. It wasn’t until he joined the Air Force and wasstationed at Ramstein Air Base in Germany that Jesse began to formally studyjudo. After his enlistment ended in his mid-twenties, he joined the Seattle JudoClub where he became a black belt and an assistant instructor. He had recentlybecome fascinated by kung fu but again couldn’t find anyone who would accept himas a student. As fate would have it, Jesse lived only four blocks from RubyChow’s restaurant and was enrolled in Edison Technical High School.When Jesse discovered his connection to Bruce, he made sure to walk ahead of himeach morning to school. Every time he passed a telephone pole he would punch andkick it, pretending like he didn’t notice Bruce behind him. For days Jesse didthis without eliciting a reaction. Finally he screwed up his courage and asked,“Is your name Bruce Lee?”“Bruce Lee is my name. What do you want?”“Do you practice kung fu?”“I do.”“Would you teach me?” Jesse asked, his heart in his mouth. When Bruce hesitated,Jesse continued, “I am very anxious to learn. I went to California looking forinstruction but I couldn’t find anyone who would teach me.”Bruce looked at Jesse for a long time, weighing the request in his mind. Thesewere the words Bruce had dreamed of hearing since his buddy Hawkins had castdoubt on his plans to teach Wing Chun in America. But he couldn’t have imaginedhis first serious entreaty would come from an African American. For centuriesthere was an unwritten prohibition against teaching outsiders kung fu. Why shareyour secret weapon with potential enemies? Bruce had nearly been kicked out ofIp Man’s school when it was discovered he was not fully Chinese. While attitudeswere changing and a handful of San Francisco kung fu studios were beginning toallow a token number of white members, nobody would teach black students. IfBruce accepted Jesse as his first disciple, he knew he would receive criticismfrom conservative Chinese chauvinists like Ruby Chow. (Sure enough, after shediscovered Bruce had an African American student, she rebuked him, “You areteaching black guys this and that. They are going to use it to beat up on theChinese.”)“It would have to be in a place where we could practice in secret,” Brucefinally said.“We could use my apartment,” Jesse suggested.“Do you live alone?”“I have two roommates.”“They will have to leave when I teach you.”“I will get rid of them.”After school they walked back to Ruby Chow’s restaurant as Bruce gave a shortlecture on the history of kung fu. When they arrived, Bruce didn’t invite Jesseinside. “Some of them don’t like blacks,” Bruce explained matter-of-factly. “Itwould be better for everyone if you remain outside. I have to work. I’ll meetyou at your apartment at six.”Bruce arrived on time at Jesse’s apartment on the southeast corner of Seventhand James. Once he was certain no one else was home he said to Jesse, “Let’s geton with it. Do you know any martial arts?”“I did a little boxing in the Air Force and I’m currently practicing judo.”“I don’t know much about boxing or judo,” Bruce said. “Will you show me yourjudo?”Jesse began with Osoto Gari (a hip toss and leg sweep). He was expecting Bruceto give a little resistance. When he didn’t, the throw ended up a lot faster andstronger than Jesse anticipated and Bruce’s head narrowly missed the sharp metalcorner of Jesse’s bed. It could have killed or maimed him, but Bruce showed noreaction.“Not bad,” Bruce said, clinically, “but I don’t like the way you have to hold onto your opponent to throw. Now I’ll show you Wing Chun. I want you to try to hitme any way you can.”Jesse threw jabs, hooks, and haymakers as fast as he could, but none madecontact. Bruce blocked each one and countered by sticking his fist right infront of Jesse’s face. Once Bruce had demonstrated he could stop all of Jesse’spunches from long range, he gave him a lesson in short-range sticky hands (chisao). Every time he touched Jesse’s hands Jesse was helpless to do anything. Ifhe tried to push forward, his motion was diverted. When he tried to pull back,Bruce stuck his fist in Jesse’s face. “He controlled me at will,” Jesseremembers. “He could do things I hadn’t even thought possible.”Bruce Lee had converted his first soul to the Church of Kung Fu.From that night on, Bruce and Jesse were inseparable. They practiced outsideevery day during lunch period under a metal stairwell and after school inJesse’s apartment. Bruce had found a friend and a training partner; Jesse, amaster. After a month, Jesse convinced Bruce to accept his roommate, Ed Hart, asa student. Ed was a two-hundred-pound former professional boxer and veteran barbrawler who could knock out a man with either hand, but in his first lesson withBruce he was no more effective than Jesse had been. Bruce easily tied him uplike a pretzel.Jesse became Bruce’s best PR agent. He couldn’t stop talking about how amazinghis new teacher was. Pretty soon several students at the Seattle Judo Club,where Jesse was an assistant instructor, began inquiring if they could learnfrom Bruce. One of them was Skip Ellsworth, who grew up as the only white kid onan Indian reservation, fighting Native American youths on a daily basis amiddismal poverty. “During Bruce’s very brief first demonstration of his kung fu,he hit me in the chest with both palms so hard that my feet left the ground andI flew backwards for what seemed like ten feet before I slammed into a wall,”Skip remembers. “Nothing like that had ever happened to me before. It only tookBruce Lee approximately two seconds to make a true believer out of me.”Just as he had at La Salle and St. Francis Xavier, Bruce was building his owngang of friend-followers at Edison Tech. Lee found his recruits among Seattle’snow vanished street-fighting scene, which consisted of a couple hundred deprivedkids of various ethnicities from areas like Lake City and Renton who fought forturf and status with fists, knives, razors, and an occasional gun. To increasehis crew’s numbers, Bruce began giving his own one-man shows.On Asian Cultural Appreciation Day at Edison Tech, Bruce gave a performance of“Kung Fu,” which the poster outside the auditorium helpfully explained was aChinese martial art. About forty students showed up to see Bruce Lee walkonstage wearing glasses, a suit, and tie. He appeared to be the stereotypicalstudious Chinese teenager. Speaking in a Hong Kong accent that made his r’ssound like w’s, Bruce launched into a potted folkloric history of kung fu: Ithad been kept secret from foreigners to keep them from using it against theChinese as they had gunpowder; Buddhist monks had developed lethal techniquesbased on the ways animals and insects fought. To demonstrate, Bruce firstassumed the Eagle stance with his hand extended in a claw, then transformed intoa Praying Mantis with his forearms making piano-hammer strikes, then a WhiteCrane with its wings spread and its legs raised in a defensive position, andfinally a Monkey’s Stealing a Peach, a euphemism for ripping your opponent’stesticles.“It was a beautiful performance, sort of a cross between ballet and mime,”remembers James DeMile. “But it sure as hell didn’t look like fighting and Brucelooked about as dangerous as Don Knotts. The audience began to titter.”Bruce went stock still, his visage darkening. The audience fell quiet veryquickly. Bruce looked directly at DeMile, who had been smirking, and said, “Youlook like you can fight. How about coming up here for a minute?”Like a newcomer to prison, Bruce had picked out the baddest dude on the yard tochallenge. DeMile was twenty years old and 220 pounds. He could indeed fight. Hewas a champion boxer and street brawler, who rarely went anywhere without a gunin his pocket. He was currently on probation.As DeMile jumped onto the stage, Lee said he would be demonstrating his ownstyle of martial arts called Wing Chun, which was developed by a Buddhist nunover four hundred years ago and emphasized close quarters combat. Bruce turnedto DeMile: “Hit me as hard as you can with either hand whenever you are ready.”DeMile was afraid he might kill the little Chinese kid with one punch. Heneedn’t have worried. Bruce proceeded to do to DeMile what he had already doneto Jesse Glover and Ed Hart. He brushed away every punch as easily as you woulda baby, and countered with punches of his own, which he stopped millimeters fromDeMile’s nose. For the finale, he tied DeMile’s arms into knots with one hand,while, to add insult to injury, knocking on DeMile’s forehead with the other.“Is anyone home?” Bruce asked to the laughter of the audience.“I was as helpless as if I was in some giant roll of flypaper. It was like aslow-motion nightmare,” DeMile recalls. “After the demonstration, I swallowedwhat little was left of my pride and asked him if he’d teach me some of histechniques.”To his crew of Jesse Glover, Ed Hart, and Skip Ellsworth, Bruce added JamesDeMile and Leroy Garcia, a grizzly bear of a young man who was also in theaudience for Bruce’s performance and must have been grateful he wasn’t the onesingled out to volunteer. Over the next few months more blue-collar young menfrom Edison Tech and the Seattle Judo Club joined: Tak Miyabe, Charlie Woo,Howard Hall, Pat Hooks, and Jesse’s younger brother, Mike. It was the mostracially diverse group of students—white, black, brown, and yellow—in thehistory of the Chinese martial arts.The final addition was Taky Kimura, who was thirty years old and owned an Asiansupermarket at Eighth and Madison. Like many in the group, Taky carried deepemotional wounds from childhood. His were a result of his incarceration duringWorld War II in a Japanese internment camp. “I thought I was white, until theysent me to the camps,”  Taky recalled. “They took away my identity because if Iwasn’t white and I wasn’t free and I wasn’t American then who was I? When I gotout of the camps I was a derelict, except I don’t drink. I was walking aroundhalf-ashamed even to be alive. And then I hear about this Chinese kid givingkung fu lessons in a parking lot near my supermarket. And there he is, bubblingwith pride, knocking these big white guys all over the place easy as you please.And I got excited about something for the first time in fifteen years. So Istarted training and bit by bit I began to get back the things I thought I’dlost forever.”The crew practiced wherever they could find an open space—parks, parking lots,and when it rained, underground parking garages. Sometimes they practiced behindRuby Chow’s restaurant where they fastened a wooden dummy to the fire escape.Every time they hit the dummy it shook the ancient wooden columns and made aterrible noise that caused Ruby and the senior cooks to loudly complain—much toBruce’s ornery delight.Classes were so informal they could barely be considered classes. The crew nevercalled Bruce master or sifu, just Bruce. He didn’t charge them anything, and hedidn’t so much teach them as use them to further his own pursuit of kung fuperfection. “We were all dummies for Bruce to train on,” Jesse noted. “He wascaught up in his own development and had little patience for teaching those whowere not quick to learn.” Bruce was like a brilliant young professor who refusesto teach introductory freshmen lectures and only keeps a group of graduatestudents to assist him with his own research and discoveries.One of these was the now famous one-inch punch. Bruce always wanted to increasethe power of his punches from shorter and shorter distances. By working on hiscoordination and timing Bruce learned how to torque his body to create themaximum amount of acceleration. “His punch got stronger with practice,” Jessesays.One day, a 230-pound man, who had heard rumors of Bruce’s one-inch punch,approached him and said, “I don’t see how you can get any power from thatdistance.”“I’ll be happy to show you,” Bruce smiled.The next instant the man was flying eight feet through the air with a look offrozen terror on his face. After crashing into a wall and slumping to the floor,the only thing the man could say was, “I see, I see.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]Bruce’s tough young friends loved him—they were receiving a world-classeducation from a budding genius for free—and he returned their affection. “Idon’t think Bruce ever again had friends with whom he was so open,” SkipEllsworth says, “or who cared for him as much.”  They were a tight crew, hangingout together before and after practices. They constantly went to the movies.Bruce introduced them to Chinese kung fu and Japanese samurai flicks but failedto convince them of the comedic genius of Jerry Lewis. “I hated comedies,” JesseGlover recalls, “and we would end up going to separate shows.”After a workout they would go to the Tai Tung Restaurant on 655 South KingStreet in Chinatown. “The advantage for us is we could always find something onthe menu that we could afford,” says Skip. Bruce was a voracious eater—he couldconsume massive quantities without gaining any weight. He was also a voracioustalker. His topics of conversation were kung fu, philosophy, cha-cha, and HongKong. He worked though his homesickness by describing the sights of Hong Kongand the places that he was going to show them when they went there together. Healso liked to debate life goals with Jesse.“I want to be rich and famous,” Bruce would say, before adding, “and the bestkung fu man in the world!”“I just want to be happy,” Jesse would reply. “Money can’t buy a good life.”“It can,” Bruce insisted.“Name me one rich person who is happy,” Jesse would purposely bait Bruce.“You’re crazy,” Bruce would shout angrily. “You’re crazy!”Jesse also liked to tease Bruce about how much gum he chewed, nearly four packsa day.“I have a cavity in my back tooth,” Bruce explained. “The gum eases the pain.”“You’re the crazy one,” Jesse said. “Gum just makes it worse. You should go to adentist.”“I hate dentists,” said Bruce. It took weeks of cajoling, but Jesse finallyconvinced Bruce to have his tooth filled.Bruce liked being fashionable. He wore shoes with Cuban heels because they madehim an inch taller. When he first came to America, his prize possession was araccoon skin coat his father had given him. He wore it everywhere until hisfriends told him raccoon wasn’t in vogue. He immediately put it in mothballs.As a prank, Bruce would dress up in his snappiest suit, swagger into a downtownrestaurant with his students acting as his bodyguards, and pretend to be the sonof the Chinese ambassador. “Bruce would act like he couldn’t speak English,”says Jesse, “and Howard, Ed, and I would pretend to translate his wishes to thewaitress.”English was Bruce’s biggest initial hurdle in America. He was proficient but notfluent. He constantly had to translate from Cantonese to English in his head.Whenever he got excited, which was often, he tripped over certain words andsyllables. “I don’t think I ever heard him say my name without stuttering,” saysJesse. “He always had to repeat the ‘J’ several times before he could spit itout.” He was extremely sensitive about his stutter—no one dared make fun of himabout it. His around-the-clock bull sessions with his boys were a way ofattacking the problem through total immersion. His English improved rapidly,although he never completely mastered it.Bruce’s street-tough students introduced him to another crucial aspect ofAmerican culture—guns. Leroy Garcia and Skip Ellsworth taught Bruce how to shootpistols, revolvers, rifles, and shotguns. They gave him his first gun, a Colt.25 caliber semiautomatic pistol with black handle grips. “Bruce totally lovedit,” says Skip. He enjoyed dressing up like a Western gunslinger with Leroy’snine-inch-barrel .357 strapped to his side, a 30-06 in his hand, and a cowboyhat on his head. His interest was less in hunting than in being a quick-drawartist. He and Leroy would practice using blank cartridges. After a short periodof time, Leroy refused to play, since the blank wads hurt like hell and Brucealways won.His friends had less success teaching him how to drive. Leroy Garcia let Brucepractice with his little Fiat. “Bruce was as poor at driving as he was good atkung fu,” says Jesse. “Every time I rode with him I felt like the trip might bemy last.” Bruce was an aggressive and often distracted driver who zoomed up oncars, tailgated, and passed without leaving enough room to pull back ifsomething went wrong. It was a combination of luck and his incredibly quickreflexes that kept him out of a serious accident. For a couple of years helonged to buy his own sports car to complete his image. “It was always on hismind,” says Jesse, “and he mentioned it at least once a day.” Finally he wasable to scrape together enough money to buy a 1957 Ford. He was so proud of ithe almost wore off the paint washing it so often.But perhaps the greatest gift his students gave to Bruce was forcing him toevolve as a martial artist. When he arrived he was wedded to Chinese kung fu,convinced of its superiority. But the sheer size of Americans made him adapt.Techniques that worked in Ip Man’s class were easily thwarted by opponents whowere eight inches taller and a hundred pounds heavier. His students, all veteranfighters and martial artists, also introduced him to the American combat scene.From them he began to learn the value of certain judo throws and chokes andappreciate the power of Western boxing’s punches and fluidity of its footwork.Bruce became an avid fan of pugilism and began borrowing moves from itschampions: Muhammad Ali’s footwork and timing, Sugar Ray Robinson’s bobs andweaves. At this point Bruce still thought of himself as a Kung Fu Man, but hewas beginning to merge the best of East and West. It was an approach that wouldlast the rest of his life, characterize his own art, and eventually lead to anew paradigm in the martial arts.Image [../images/sec.jpg]As Bruce and his merry band of mayhem continued to practice in public parks andparking lots, word began to spread about this little Chinese kid and what hecould do. Crowds began to gather when they trained and individuals asked aboutjoining the class. Since his arrival in America, Bruce had been giving dancinglessons for money. Now he realized he might be able to do the same with kung fu.To do so, he would need a permanent location. The crew pooled their money andrented the only place they could afford—a two-story storefront at 651 SouthWeller in a dilapidated section of Chinatown. Gypsies lived in the storefrontacross the street, hobos camped out in a nearby vacant lot, and derelictsinhabited an abandoned hotel three doors down, but the gang couldn’t have beenhappier. “We felt like we were on top of the world,” says Skip.Bruce conceived of the space less as a traditional kung fu kwoon (school) thanas a private clubhouse. The original ten charter members of his crew chipped in$10 a month to cover the $100 rent and in return continued to receive freeinstruction. Anyone accepted as a student afterward paid tuition directly toBruce. Training took place on the 120-square-foot first floor where spectatorscould watch from the sidewalk. The large room on the second floor was reservedas a hangout spot for the charter members. In less than a year, Bruce had openedhis own kung fu studio, a remarkable achievement for a fresh-off-the-boatnineteen-year-old.Anxious to increase enrollment, Bruce took his act on the road, like his fatherbefore him, treading the boards in a traveling kung fu show. His troupeperformed at the International Trade Fair, Seafair, the World’s Fair, theChinese New Year celebrations in Seattle and Vancouver, the Fremont Street Fair,and the University Street Fair. As part of his showmanship and salesmanship,Bruce asked his friends to wear kung fu uniforms, bow to him on stage, and callhim sifu. By workshopping his material in front of various live audiences, Bruceslowly created his onstage persona—a funny, philosophical, and fearsomecharacter—which he would play, with slight variations, for the rest of his life.The crew had a rowdy blast. Their one concern was Bruce’s vulnerability to heat.“The only time I started to worry was when the stage lights made him sweat,”says Jesse. “Whenever he got overheated his control would fade and I would getthe hell knocked out of me.” During their demonstration in Vancouver, Bruceaccidentally hit Jesse four or five times, leaving him with a sore temple,swollen lip, and a bloody nose.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Bruce didn’t go looking for fights in Seattle, but he struggled to controlhimself when fights came looking for him. And they often did. Bruce had a“cocky” walk that attracted attention and he was fearless about going placeswhere Chinese were not typically welcome. One night four guys approached Bruceand his white date, making racist remarks about the chink and his blond chick.Bruce went ballistic and was going to blast all four of them until his dateforced him to walk away. Bruce was less inclined to turn the other cheek when hewas with one of his boys. An incident broke out at an “all black” pool hall near23rd and Madison between Bruce, Skip, and several of the regulars. Skip andBruce also engaged in a brief skirmish at a cowboy honky-tonk in Montana. “Brucecould end any physical confrontation within three or four seconds,” says Skip.“He was one of the best fighters who ever lived.”Bruce’s public demonstrations were another source of conflict. He peppered hisperformances with blunt analysis and dismissive critiques of competing styles ofmartial arts. For every two people he recruited to his school, he offended atleast one. As inspiring and infectious as he was to his followers, he came offas brash and egotistical to his detractors.One of them was Yoichi Nakachi, a twenty-nine-year-old Japanese classmate atEdison Technical. During Bruce’s first demonstration at Edison he had assertedthat soft styles like Chinese kung fu were superior to hard styles like Japanesekarate. Yoichi, a black belt in karate and veteran street fighter, took offense.He and a buddy showed up at Bruce’s next performance at Yesler Terrace. After itwas over, Yoichi sent his friend backstage to issue a challenge on his behalf.Uncharacteristically, Bruce hesitated and then checked with his crew to makesure he wouldn’t lose face with them if he didn’t accept. When they told him hedidn’t have anything to prove to them, he refused the challenge.For the next several weeks at school, Yoichi tried to provoke Bruce, sneering athim in the cafeteria, bumping into him in the hallway. Other Chinese guys cameup to Bruce and told him if he wasn’t willing to fight this Japanese punk, theywould. “I’m not going to let anyone prod me into a fight,” Bruce told them.Finally, Yoichi pushed Bruce too far. In the school’s basement lounge, Yoichisent a friend over to Bruce with a note that read: “If Bruce Lee wants to go tothe hospital, walk over to me.” Bruce left the lounge and waited for Jesse tocome out of class. He was so angry he could hardly speak.“What’s wrong?” Jesse asked.“I’m going to fight that son of a bitch,” Bruce sputtered. “Will you be mysecond?”“Let’s go,” Jesse said as they headed for the basement lounge.“I want to fight him on the third floor.”“I don’t know,” Jesse hesitated. “We could get expelled.”“I hadn’t thought of that,” Bruce said, remembering his expulsion from La Salle.“Where do you suggest?”“The downtown YMCA would be better. If anyone comes in during the fight we canalways say it’s just friendly sparring.”“Agreed,” Bruce said. “Will you arrange it? I’m too angry right now. I don’ttrust myself near him.”Bruce, Jesse, Ed Hart, and Howard Hall waited at the bus stop in front of theschool for Yoichi and two of his Japanese friends.“You insulted me and my country,” Yoichi declared.Bruce was furious. Jesse was afraid the fight was going to happen right there.Bruce looked away in an effort to control his rage. Yoichi kept moving intoBruce’s line of vision in an attempt to break down his confidence. When the busfinally arrived Yoichi sat in front of Bruce and started to discuss the rules inan abrasive manner.“Forget the rules,” Bruce snarled, the veins in his neck bulging. “I’m going allout.”“Why don’t you stop talking,” Jesse said to Yoichi. “We will move to differentseats.” Jesse spent the rest of the trip downtown trying to calm Bruce down andget him to agree not to go all out. He was afraid Bruce might kill Yoichi.When they reached the Y, Bruce, Ed, Howard, and Jesse went directly to thehandball court. Yoichi and his two friends went to a bathroom where he changedinto a white karate gi. Bruce tested the wood floors with his shoes and decidedto go barefoot. He took off his dress shirt and did a couple of deep knee bendsin his undershirt.As the two young men faced off, Bruce wanted to make one thing clear: “Youchallenged me, right?”“Ya, ya, ya,” Yoichi said.“You asked for this fight?”“Ya, ya, ya.”“All right,” Bruce said.Jesse, who was the referee, stepped out to explain the rules: the fight wouldconsist of three two-minute rounds with the winner being the man who won two ofthe three. Ed Hart, serving as timekeeper, pulled out his stopwatch.Bruce stood in a relaxed Wing Chun stance: right foot forward, right handpointing at Yoichi’s nose, left palm next to right elbow. Yoichi started in aclassic karate stance with one leg extended behind him, one hand facing Brucewith palm out, the other hand in a fist chambered at his waist.“Ready? Set, go!” Jesse shouted.Yoichi immediately switched to a cat stance and flicked a quick front snap kickat Bruce’s groin. Bruce deflected it with his right forearm, followed with hisleft fist to Yoichi’s face, and then immediately launched a series of rapid WingChun chain punches. Each blow rippled Yoichi’s face like waves on a lake. Brucesmacked Yoichi across the entire handball court without getting counterpunchedonce. Yoichi flailed at him but all his blows were blocked by Bruce’s forearms.Bruce controlled the centerline and his defenses could not be penetrated. AsYoichi’s back slammed into the wall he grabbed Bruce’s arms and pulled to theside. Bruce responded by twisting his hips and delivering a double-fistpunch—his right connected with Yoichi’s face at the same moment his left blastedYoichi’s chest. The power of the impact lifted Yoichi off his feet and sent himflying back six feet in the air. Bruce ran forward and kicked Yoichi in the faceas soon as his knees hit the floor. Blood sprayed from Yoichi’s nose. Hecollapsed in a heap as if he was dead.“Stop!” Jesse screamed.Jesse and Ed Hart ran over to Yoichi to check his pulse. After a few moments, heregained consciousness. The first question from Yoichi’s lips was: “How long didit take him to defeat me?”Hart looked at his stopwatch. It read eleven seconds. Feeling sorry for the guy,Ed doubled it: “twenty-two seconds.”As Yoichi pulled himself off the floor, he said, “I want a rematch. I didn’ttrain properly for this fight. I want to do it again.”“I never wanted to fight you in the first place,” Bruce replied. “There’s nopoint in fighting again. As far as I’m concerned this is over. I will never talkto anyone else about what happened.”As everyone left, Bruce made his friends promise they wouldn’t discuss the fightwith outsiders. Yoichi’s buddies leaked the details to the rest of the school.To save face, Yoichi asked Bruce if he could become his disciple and takeprivate lessons with him. Bruce told him he would have to join his club’s formalclass and learn with the rest of the beginners. Yoichi swallowed his pride andattended classes for a month before dropping out.“A lot of people took exception to the things Bruce said,” recalls Taky Kimura,“but when they saw what he could do, they all wanted to join him.”"},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f0106-01.jpg]At home in Hong Kong, Grace Ho and her son, proudly wearing his University ofWashington Huskies sweatshirt, June 1963.

(DavidTadman)"},{"pageContent":"SIXHUSKYMuch to the surprise of his friends and family in Hong Kong, Bruce gainedadmission to the University of Washington on March 27, 1961. For a boy who hadbeen held back, expelled, and regarded as a lost cause, it was a remarkable turnof events. When his father heard the news, he danced around the apartmentsinging, “We picked the right horse to bet on!” For the first time in a longtime, he had given his father face and reason to be proud. Only the very best(or the very richest) Hong Kong students attended a university in Britain orAmerica.Aside from a few core requirements in math and science, Bruce primarily pickedclasses that matched his interests. He signed up for courses in gymnastics,dance, judo, drawing, and public speaking. His major was drama. Whenever he hadthe chance, he explored the spiritual nature of kung fu. For a freshman Englishessay he wrote, “Gung fu is a special skill, a fine art rather than just aphysical exercise. . . . The core principle of Gung fu is Tao—the spontaneity ofthe universe.” For a poetry assignment, he described a mystical experience whilewalking along Lake Washington: “In the moonlight I slowly move to a Gung Fuform; Body and soul are as though fused into one.”It was not until his junior year that Bruce’s intellectual curiosity led him tobranch out into new areas of inquiry. He took two courses in psychology (GeneralPsychology and Psychology of Adjustment) and two philosophy classes (Intro toPhilosophy and Chinese Philosophy). These two subjects became lifelong passions.After college he added hundreds of philosophy and psychology books to hispersonal library of over 2,500 books, carefully reading and transcribing hisfavorite passages in his notebooks. His favorite authors included ThomasAquinas, David Hume, René Descartes, Carl Jung, and Carl Rogers. He would latertell reporters that his major in college was philosophy, even though he neverofficially switched from drama and only took two classes in the subject.His interest did not translate into good grades. His GPA after his freshman yearwas 1.84. Even in gymnastics he only scored a C. (In his later Hong Kong kung fumovies, all of his handsprings and backflips were done by a CantoneseOpera–trained stunt double.) After having achieved the unexpected goal ofactually getting into college, he lost focus, slipped back into old habits, andonly studied enough to get by. His more studious classmates thought of him as ajock and jokingly nicknamed him Beefcake. “Bruce talked to me about martialarts, philosophy, and girls, but he never mentioned academics,” recalls EuniceLam, who was dating his older brother, Peter. “If you wanted him to shut hismouth, the best way was to ask him about his studies.”Although he never joined a fraternity, he went to a number of frat parties withhis classmate and kung fu student Skip Ellsworth, who pledged Delta KappaEpsilon. It was yet another chance for Bruce to be the life of the party. Hewould demonstrate his one-inch punch, two-finger push-ups, sticky hands, andvarious kung fu forms, especially Praying Mantis, to the delight and amazementof the frat boys. He taught the sorority girls how to cha-cha. It was Bruce’sfirst introduction to the affluent children of America’s elite, and theirpositive reaction to his talents opened his eyes about how important kung fucould be to him in the States. “How would they treat me if they knew I lived ina closet and worked as dishwasher in a Chinese restaurant?” Bruce would halfjoke with Skip. Seeing how their comfortable lives compared to his meagercircumstances inflamed Lee’s ambition to succeed in America.One area of campus life that held no interest for Bruce was the growing studentactivism of the early 1960s. Although he was generally aware of the changessweeping across the country—the civil rights movement and antiwar protests—hedid not watch the news on TV or subscribe to a newspaper. His focus was on thepersonal not the political, self-improvement not social change, making himselfbetter at martial arts not making the world a better place. It was a curiousblind spot considering he was nearly drafted to fight in Vietnam.At the University of Washington, Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) wasmandatory for every male student. Like almost everyone on campus, Bruce resentedthe required early morning drills. He skipped so many marching exercises that hewas finally ordered to get up at 4 a.m. and march for hours to make up the losttime. When the drill sergeant noticed that Bruce was chewing gum, he bellowed,“Swallow that, soldier!” Bruce spit it on the ground instead.As the sergeant glowered at him, Bruce grinned. “It’s bad for my health!”After the exercises were over, the furious sergeant got in Bruce’s face andwarned him, “The next time I say, ‘Swallow, soldier,’ you’d better swallow!”Bruce erupted, “Son of a bitch, if you ever speak to me like that again, I willknock you on your ass!”For a moment as they glared at each other, it seemed like violence might ensue,but the sergeant, seeing the fire in Bruce’s eyes, wisely decided to back down.He walked away, shaking his head and mumbling, “Poor misguided kid.”Bruce Jun Fan Lee signed up for the draft, as was required of all American menbetween the ages of eighteen and twenty-five, but was rejected by the draftboard. He was categorized as 4-F, medically unfit for service, after thephysical examination revealed he had one undescended testicle. Bruce had beenborn with this defect, called cryptorchidism. The two risks associated with itare infertility and testicular cancer. For years, Bruce was convinced he couldnever be a father. Seven years later in 1969, he underwent an operation toremove the undescended testicle at St. John’s Hospital in Santa Monica.Image [../images/sec.jpg]During his first year in America, Bruce and his high school sweetheart, Pearl,slowly grew apart. Their letters became less and less frequent. Hoping tosalvage their long-distance relationship, Pearl flew to Seattle to see Bruce,but he forgot to pick her up from the airport. After waiting for hours, she grewso angry she hopped a flight to San Francisco. When Bruce realized his mistake,he made numerous phone calls to beg her forgiveness, but she refused to accepthis apology.After Pearl, Bruce dated a number of young women, but none for any length oftime. He was a charmer and a bit of a player. “If a pretty girl was anywherenear, Bruce would perk up and start a spontaneous kung fu demo,” says JamesDeMile. “He would point to me and explain how fast and tough I was and thenpromptly knock me over and under.” Bruce liked to take his dates to the movies.“R, how could we let the valuable but short autumn days slip away without doingthem full justice,” he wrote one of his girlfriends. “Write me a letter tellingme which movie you haven’t seen and I’ll invite you to see it this Sunday. Thatwill suit you, won’t it, my dear young lady? With my best wishes for all kindsof luck. I am, Bruce.”It wasn’t until his first year of college that Bruce fell head over heels inlove. He was lounging with friends in the student center, the HUB, when henoticed a stunning Japanese American sophomore named Amy Sanbo sitting in a farcorner. Entranced, Bruce left his friends and moved to a nearby table to get acloser look. When she walked past him to go to class, he suddenly said, “Hello,”and grabbed her forearm with his index finger and thumb. He squeezed with suchpower that Amy’s knees buckled and she nearly dropped her books on the floor.“Let go of me before I really get angry!” she exclaimed. When he did, she asked,“Why did you do that?”“I was just showing my friends how much power can be exerted with only twofingers.”“What a jerk!” she said as she marched away.While not a particularly suave approach, it left an impression, literally—theblack-and-blue bruise on her arm lasted for days. For the next several weekswherever Amy went Bruce popped up out of nowhere. Trying to make it up to her,Bruce would ask, “How do you feel? Are you okay? My name is Bruce Lee.” He wouldbring up any random topic of conversation just to talk to her.Bruce pursued Amy with the same single-minded devotion as he did kung fuperfection. In love, as in combat, his strategy was to overwhelm the target. Oneday she stepped on a nail at ballet practice and needed crutches to get toclass. When Bruce saw her struggling up a long flight of concrete stairs northof the football field, he ran to her and offered to help.“No, I’ll do it myself,” she said. “Give me my crutches back, and I’ll do itmyself.”Ignoring her protests, he picked her up and carried her, her textbooks, hercrutches, and her heavy coat to the top. He did this every day until her foothealed. And it wasn’t just those stairs. After school he carried her to thethird floor of her apartment, and anywhere else he thought would be difficult.His chivalry won her over. “Not only was it quite a feat of strength, it was agrand gesture,” Amy recalls. “It more than made up for his past indiscretion.”What followed over the next two years was a tempestuous, on-again-off-againrelationship. The magnetism was mutual and physical. Both of them were beautifuland both were dancers. “When I perform it’s almost orgasmic. It is very sexual,and Bruce was like that, too,” Amy says. “I’m horribly attracted to talent, andBruce was a kinetic genius. He could just look at a movement and assimilate it,absorb it, become that movement. He moved in a way that no other Asians moved.”When she challenged him to do a pirouette, he pulled it off in one try. She alsoteased him about the stiffness of his cha-cha. “Why don’t you put a little funkinto it?” After placing some R&B records on the turntable, he was quickly ableto feel the music and get down. “It’s very hard to teach someone that, but Brucehad it,” Amy recalls. “He could get funky.”“More than anything else, what I liked most about Bruce was that he neverapologized for being Oriental,” Amy says. “In a time when so many Asians weretrying to convince themselves they were white, Bruce was so proud to be Chinesehe was busting with it.”One day on campus, Bruce pulled her into an open office in Parrington Hall onthe pretext that they could study together there in privacy. It turned out tobelong to Theodore Roethke, the university’s internationally acclaimed, PulitzerPrize–winning poet. When Roethke walked in and caught them, he declared, “I’mRoethke, the poet! What are you doing in my room?”Amy froze, but Bruce stood up, walked right over to him, and stuck out his hand.“I’m Bruce Sifu Lee, kung fu master. Good to meet you.”“What is kung fu?” Roethke asked.Delighted by the question, Bruce went to the chalkboard and launched into afifteen-minute lecture on kung fu, complete with diagrams and an explanation ofthe principles of yin and yang. Amy wanted to crawl under the door, but Roethkewas mesmerized. When Bruce finished, Roethke said, “I think I understand. Thankyou. Please come back anytime you want to talk more about kung fu.”  The nextday, Roethke recounted the story to his class: “I met a young man, and he issupposed to be a master of the martial arts. He seemed pretty lethal.”The difficulty in Bruce and Amy’s relationship stemmed from their divergentupbringings. Bruce had a traditional 1950s view of gender roles, whereas Amy wasa 1960s proto-feminist. One of her earliest memories was of armed soldiersrummaging through her mother’s underwear in the Tule Lake relocation camp wherethey had been interned with other Japanese Americans during World War II. Amycame out of the experience determined that she would never be caged again.Besides studying ballet, Amy was working her way through college by singing witha jazz band, a risqué activity for the prim Japanese American community. Amydreamed of an artistic career—singing, dancing, and acting.Bruce had his own artistic dreams, which were so big and difficult to achieve,he felt she should prioritize his over hers. “Your whole thing is Bruce Lee,”Sanbo complained. “All your thoughts, all your goals are Bruce Lee. I haven’theard anything about Amy.”“But my goals are so exciting I want to share them with you,” Bruce replied,unable to understand why this made her even angrier.Amy loved Bruce, but he drove her crazy. She felt he was suffocating her—alwayswanting to know where she was going and with whom. Whenever she wanted to go toChinatown without him, Bruce insisted that one of his kung fu students serve asher bodyguard. “Who the hell are your thugs supposed to defend me from?” sheshouted at him. “I grew up in Chinatown!”Bruce repeatedly asked Amy to marry him. He offered her his grandmother’s ring—asapphire on a white cross. Amy was torn. He was so much fun to be around andthey had so much in common. She believed they could be together forever, but shewas also afraid they might kill each other. She worried he just wanted to lockher down, keep her by his side all the time. She wasn’t ready for that kind ofcommitment and she didn’t think deep down he was ready for the responsibility.“I’m taking care of my mother who is ill,” Amy said. “Are you capable ofsupporting us?”When she finally dumped him for good during the spring semester of 1963, Brucewas devastated. For weeks, he could barely leave his room. “Bruce washeartbroken,” Jesse Glover recalls. “He didn’t do anything during this periodexcept draw pictures of Amy and talk to his close friends about the emotionsthat he felt.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]Bruce’s primary focus in college was his kung fu club. Before he enrolled as afreshman at the University of Washington in 1961, he planned to open his club tothe public and turn it into a commercial school, which would allow him to quithis hated job at Ruby Chow’s. Instead, his second student, Ed Hart, moved toBrooklyn to find work, and no sooner had he left than other members began todrop out. Within two months the original group dwindled down to such a smallnumber that Bruce was unable to cover the rent. In May 1961, Bruce wrote to EdHart, “I don’t have a club anymore; in fact, we still owe $80 for it, aseverybody is out of a job and couldn’t keep it up. Also, I have stopped teachingas I have to have a part time job to tide me over my financial problems. . . . Imiss you very much, and I hope that you can come back to Seattle.”With the loss of their clubhouse, Bruce and his crew were back to square one,practicing in parks and students’ apartments. On the weekends, Bruce heldlessons with the remaining core members—Jesse Glover, Taky Kimura, James DeMile,Howard Hall—at Leroy Garcia’s house. During the week, he and Skip Ellsworthinstructed a group of University of Washington students on the green used foroutdoor concerts. This went on for about a year before Bruce was able to scrapetogether enough money to rent a basement space on King Street in Seattle’sChinatown and officially open his first public school or kwoon.Bruce Jun Fan Lee named it the Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute after himself—a veryAmerican thing to do. It was the first step in his American dream to create achain of kung fu schools across the country. In September of 1962, he wrote aletter to his former sweetheart, Pearl Tso, laying out the mission statement forhis life:In every industry, in every profession, ideas are what America is looking for.Ideas have made America what she is, and one good idea will make a man what hewants to be. . . .Gung fu is the best of all martial arts; yet the Chinese derivatives of judo andkarate, which are only basics of gung fu, are flourishing all over the U.S. Thisso happens because no one has heard of this supreme art; also there are nocompetent instructors. . . .I believe my long years of practice back up my title to become the firstinstructor of this movement. There are yet years ahead of me to polish mytechnique and character. My aim, therefore, is to establish a first Gung FuInstitute that will spread all over the U.S. (I have set the time limit of 10 to15 years to complete the whole project.) My reason in doing this is not the soleobjective of making money. The motives are many and among them are: I like tolet the world know about the greatness of this Chinese art; I enjoy teaching andhelping people; I like to have a well-to-do home for my family; I like tooriginate something; and the last but yet one of the most important is becausegung fu is part of myself. . . .I feel I have this great creative and spiritual force within me that is greaterthan faith, greater than ambition, greater than confidence, greater thandetermination, greater than vision. It is all of these combined. . . .I may now own nothing but a little place down in a basement, but once myimagination has got up a full head of steam, I can see painted on a canvas of mymind a picture of a fine, big five or six story Gung Fu Institute with branchesall over the States.Twenty-one-year-old Bruce Lee concluded by framing his career goals as part of aspiritual quest. He didn’t just want worldly success—he also desired innerpeace.All in all, the goal of my planning and doing is to find the true meaning oflife—peace of mind. I know that the sum of all possessions I mentioned does notnecessarily add up to peace of mind; however, it can be if I devote my energy toreal accomplishment of self rather than neurotic combat. In order to achievethis peace of mind, the teaching of detachment of Taoism and Zen prove to bevaluable.The first obstacle to Bruce’s grand plans came from his senior student, JesseGlover. He and several other original club members, who were used to trainingwith Bruce for free, were put off by Bruce’s efforts to formalize andcommercialize his art. At first, Jesse and the others avoided Bruce’s newschool. “I found it a little difficult to start calling someone who I had beenrunning around with for two years, Sifu,” Jesse says, using the Chinese word for“Master.” Annoyed, Bruce made it clear he wasn’t going to share his secrets orreveal his best techniques to anyone who wasn’t “strongly in his corner.”  Thisprovoked Jesse, who was almost as prideful as Bruce, to split away and takeLeroy Garcia and James DeMile with him. The breakup was in many ways morepainful for Bruce than the one with Amy Sanbo.The rebel faction opened their own school, not a franchise of the Jun Fan GungFu Institute but a competitor, in the basement of the New Richmond Hotel. Themarket for kung fu in Seattle in 1962 was not big enough to support two kwoonsand Jesse’s school closed in five months. He tried again, opening a secondschool on Pike Street in 1963. Jesse did the teaching and James DeMile wasresponsible for recruiting. As the school was struggling to survive with only ahandful of students, DeMile made a trip to Bruce’s brand-new studio onUniversity Way with its fifty-plus disciples.After the divorce, the relationship between Jesse, Jim, and Bruce was overtlyfriendly and polite but carried an undertow of hurt feelings and betrayal. Thatday a handful of Bruce’s students cornered DeMile and asked, “Why did you andJesse stop training with Bruce?”“We didn’t like some of the changes he was making,” DeMile bluntly told them.“We felt like he was holding things back, leaving out important pieces of whatmake his system work.”When the students later reported back to Bruce what DeMile had said, he erupted.Bruce recognized immediately that the criticism was a crude attempt to stealstudents away from him, and thus a threat to his livelihood.The next time DeMile showed up, Lee was in anything but a peaceful frame ofmind. He confronted DeMile and asked in a voice pinched with rage: “Why did yousay those things?”“They asked me a question and I told them the truth,” DeMile replieddefensively.Bruce pointed his finger into DeMile’s chest and declared, “You have no right tomake comments to my class.”“You are right,” DeMile backed down. “I’m sorry.”Still furious, Bruce slapped a pair of gloves he was holding into his open palm.He seemed ready to attack.DeMile thought to himself, “To fight Bruce when he is calm is insanity, but todo it when he is mad is to invite certain death.” DeMile slipped his hand intohis coat pocket and curled his index finger around the trigger of a handgun. IfBruce leapt at him, DeMile planned to blow a hole in him.“I apologize again. I was wrong. I’m sorry,” DeMile said, as he slowly backedaway, turned around, and walked out the door. It was the last time the two youngmen ever spoke.Image [../images/sec.jpg]In the summer of 1963, four years after his banishment, Bruce Lee returned toHong Kong for a three-month vacation. He had left by boat as an embarrassmentand was arriving by airplane as a success. Dressed in his sharpest suit and tie,Bruce was greeted at Kai Tak Airport by his mother, father, younger brother,Robert, auntie Eva Tso, cousin Nguyen Yu Ming, and Mary Wong, his costar fromThunderstorm (1957). Robert, who was beginning his career in music, invited aphotojournalist from the Overseas Chinese Daily News to capture the event.It was a powerful moment of reconciliation between father and son. As is Chinesecustom, Bruce brought back gifts for his family—symbolic proof of his prosperityin a foreign land. He handed to his father a hundred dollar bill, the amount hisparents had given him when he left in 1959, and a brand-new overcoat.“Dad, this is for you,” Bruce said. “I bought it myself as a gift for you.”Hoi Chuen grabbed his son, whom he had once called “a useless person,” andembraced him. Bruce’s eyes grew moist and tears streamed down his face.“I shouldn’t have treated you like this,” Hoi Chuen said, his voice choking withemotion.“No, Dad, you were right,” Bruce replied. “I wouldn’t have changed my outlook onlife otherwise.”In the photos, Hoi Chuen is wearing his new overcoat and beaming from ear toear, his grin electric. “I had never seen a smile like that on Dad’s face,”recalls Robert.His son, who was lost, was now found.Waiting at the family apartment on Nathan Road were more friends and amulti-course catered banquet, a feast and a celebration for the prodigal son’sreturn. Everyone was amazed at how much Bruce had matured. He was more confidentand secure in himself. His sense of humor kept everyone laughing. He was proudof what he had accomplished in America. As the banquet wound down, he switchedinto a University of Washington sweatshirt. He dazzled his family with ademonstration of his hard-won kung fu skills. “When he left he was an aboveaverage student of the martial arts,” says Robert, “but when he returned it wasobvious he possessed a very special talent.” Bruce also surprised them with hisphilosophical side, which they had never seen in him before. He was lessself-centered and self-involved and more in tune with everyone around him. Hislife seemed to have a purpose.After four years of training and teaching kung fu in the States, Bruce wanted totest his skill level against the Hong Kong masters. He visited a number ofdifferent schools to learn their best techniques. In the process, he often triedto alter and improve them. But instead of praising his innovations, the oldmasters rebuked him for corrupting tradition. Their negative reaction causedBruce to become increasingly disillusioned with the conservatism of traditionalkung fu.His most important test came at Ip Man’s school where he competed in stickyhands (chi sao) with his martial brothers and teachers. When he left in 1959,Bruce considered himself the sixth-best in the school. After four years away, hehad only moved up to fourth. He was still unable to best his teacher, Wong ShunLeung, or his master, Ip Man—plus one of Ip Man’s assistant instructors. Whileanyone else would have considered this decent progress—all three were many yearshis senior—Bruce, ever the perfectionist, was so frustrated he brieflyconsidered quitting the martial arts completely. But after he cooled down, hebecame even more determined to be better than them. He decided he would have totrain fanatically and develop more modifications to circumvent their classicaltechniques.During his period of doubt with the martial arts, Bruce flirted with the idea ofreviving his acting career. He hoped to act in at least one quickie Hong Kongmovie during his summer break. After all, the film he starred in before he left,The Orphan (1960), was a critical and box office hit. When it was released, oneof Hong Kong’s greatest action directors, Chang Cheh (The One-Armed Swordsman,Five Deadly Venoms), was so impressed by Bruce’s performance he went to his newstudio, Shaw Brothers, and asked them to sign the Little Dragon, but by thistime Bruce had already left for America.Having heard the positive buzz about his last role, Bruce approached some of hisold contacts expecting multiple offers. He soon discovered, however, that fouryears is forever in the movie business. His father, who had retired, couldn’thelp and many of his old colleagues had no time for a former actor. One eveningas he was strolling along the beach, he saw Christine Pai Lu-Ming, his costarfrom Sweet Time Together (1956), and went over to say, “Hi.” Christine walkedstraight past him without even bothering to glance in his direction. Bruce wascrushed. No matter how hard he knocked on the film industry’s doors they wereall locked and the passwords changed.Although he couldn’t land an acting gig, he did have a delightful chance toserve as an acting coach. While he was away, one of his old flames, Amy Chan(Pak Yan), had begun what would become a long and illustrious film and TVcareer. When she heard Bruce was back in town, she called him up. “They keepcasting me as sly girls,” she coyly said. “Can you teach me how to be bad?”After the heartbreaking dissolution of his relationship with Amy Sanbo, it wasan offer he couldn’t refuse. They spent many nights dining and dancing at theCarlton Hotel in Tai Po.To make sure he looked his best for all his dates, Bruce had the family’sprivate tailor make him cool custom clothes that he helped design. He was sofussy he ironed them himself, because he was afraid the house servants wouldn’tdo it right. As Bruce explained to an American friend, “This is Hong Kong—theyrespect your clothing first before they respect you!”His taste in fashion occasionally got him into trouble. One evening he went outwith a female friend, Eunice Lam, to the Eagle Nest in the Hilton Hotel, themost luxurious club on Hong Kong Island. He wore a new black formal suit with ashimmering purple shirt and became the center of attention on the dance floorwith his sensational cha-cha dragon steps. On the ferry back to the Kowloonside, Bruce took off his jacket in the humid Hong Kong evening. His strikingpurple shirt drew the attention of two hooligans, who began to mock and cursehim for looking like a dandy. Bruce smiled at them and said, “You’d better keepyour mouths shut or you will be in trouble later.”When they reached the Star Ferry Pier, the ruffians alighted first and waitednear the flagpole at the corner of the pier. Bruce guided Eunice past them andtoward her home. The thugs followed, taunting Bruce: “Where are you going sofast? Do you have to hurry home to momma?”Eunice was terrified, but Bruce was calm and composed. When the thugs got tooclose, Bruce spun to face them. Suddenly Eunice heard screaming and looked back.One of the ruffians was on the ground grabbing his leg in terrible pain; theother was fleeing in terror. Bruce smiled at her and said, “Just treated him tomy shin kick!”When Bruce’s cousin Frank, who was a few years older, heard the story he shookhis head and made a joke about Bruce’s growing maturity. “If that had been a fewyears ago,” Frank said, “Bruce would have beaten them all up as soon as they gotoff the ferry.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]Bruce invited his brightest American student, Doug Palmer, to visit him in HongKong. After a year studying with Bruce as a senior in high school, Doug had goneon to Yale University where he was majoring in Mandarin and East Asian Studies.Before Palmer arrived, Bruce wrote him a letter warning him of the heat wave anddrought that had plunged the colony into misery: “Man, believe me it’s hot. Thewater supply here is coming to a crisis—it is only on for a few hours everyfourth day. The temperature is 95 degrees and it’s like living in hell.”As soon as Doug stepped off the plane, it felt like he had entered a sauna. Thenhe caught a whiff of Hong Kong’s distinctive odor: a thick tropical salt air,suffused with a stew of exotic foods, rotting garbage, and human sweat. “Theride from the airport was exhilarating,” recalls Doug, “through narrow streetsof pushcarts and lorries and weaving taxis, between tall tenement and officebuildings with crowded shops at street level, and colorful signs in Chinesecharacters. Swarms of people filled the sidewalks, sitting in front of shops,standing at food stalls, coolies in undershirts and old ladies in blackpajama-like pantsuits rubbing shoulders with businessmen in Western suits.Despite the drought and debilitating heat, the beggars and refugees, the filth,it was everything I had hoped for.”When Doug, who was six-foot-four and 220 pounds, walked into the apartment,Bruce’s entire family stood back and gasped. “We had seen tall British guysbefore,” recalls Robert, “but it was like a giant came to visit. We had to letit sink in a bit.” At dinner in the main room of the apartment, Bruce beganDoug’s education in Chinese etiquette. The first course was soup and Doug sat upstraight, raised his soup spoon to his mouth, and took care not to slurp. Hedidn’t realize that eating quietly is taken as a sign that you don’t like thetaste of the food. Bruce leaned over and whispered in his ear, “Make a littlenoise.”Bruce took Doug to visit Ip Man in his apartment at the top of a high-rise. “Hewas a smiling man with a twinkle in his eyes, slight and getting on in years butstill fit,” recalls Doug. Before they arrived, Bruce made Doug promise that hewouldn’t do or say anything to reveal he was Bruce’s student. Ip Man wasold-school and didn’t believe kung fu should be taught to foreigners. As Dougsat in the corner pretending to be clueless, he had the opportunity to watch twoof the most famous kung fu artists of the twentieth century practice chi sao forhours in their undershirts. It was the first time Doug had ever seen Bruceunable to dominate someone.A week before Doug and Bruce were to leave for the States, Bruce returned to theapartment with a tentative, bow-legged walk and quickly changed his tight pantsfor loose-fitting black pajama pants he borrowed from his father.“What’s wrong?” Robert asked.“I’ve been circumcised,” replied Bruce.“What is circumcision?” Robert asked.Bruce lowered his pants as all the men in the family gathered around to inspectthe surgeon’s handiwork. As Bruce described the procedure in gory detail, Robertexclaimed, “Why? Why?”“It’s what they do in America,” Bruce said. “I’m American. I want to look thepart.”“How bad does it hurt?” Robert asked, pointing at the sutures and bandages. “Areyou going to rest for a few days?”“No, it’s really no big deal,” Bruce replied with manly assurance. “I’ll walktomorrow to get some exercise.”The next day he left the house only to return fifteen minutes later bleeding andin severe pain. Like it or not, Bruce had to rest up for the next few days untilhe healed. Every morning his father, brother, and cousin would conduct aninspection to note the progress he was making.At the end of July as Doug and Bruce packed to leave, Bruce and Hoi Chuenhugged, their reconciliation complete. It was the last time Bruce would see hisfather alive."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f0122-01.jpg]Linda, Bruce, and Brandon Lee, circa 1965. (Photo 12 / Alamy Stock Photo)"},{"pageContent":"SEVENSUNNY SIDE OF THE BAYLinda Emery was born in Everett, Washington, on March 21, 1945, to a Baptistfamily of Swedish, Irish, and English descent. Her father, Everett, passed awaywhen she was five and her mother, Vivian, struggled to raise Linda and her oldersister on her own. Vivian took a job at Sears and later got remarried to a man,who was, in Linda’s words, “in no way like a father. He was not a good person.”Linda was a quiet but determined child—shy, thoughtful, introverted, humble,prone to self-doubt and yet fiercely loyal, reliable in a crisis, andunbreakable. Brown-haired and blue-eyed, she was pretty in a girl-next-door way,although she never considered herself to be particularly attractive.Growing up poor in Seattle, Linda attended Garfield High, a tough, inner-cityschool, which was 40 percent black, 40 percent white, and 20 percent Asian. Shewas a good student, serious about her academics. She planned to be the firstwoman in her family to attend college. Seeing how her mother suffered inlow-wage jobs, Linda dreamed of becoming a doctor. She was proud to make thecheerleading squad. Her best friend was Sue Ann Kay, an extroverted ChineseAmerican. Linda briefly dated a half-Japanese boy in high school until hermother found out and forbade her. It was okay for Linda to have Asiangirlfriends but not boyfriends.One day during her senior year Linda was hanging by the lockers with Sue Ann andsome of her cheerleading friends when a former homecoming queen swept into theschool—Amy Sanbo. On her arm was a devilishly handsome young man wearing acustom-tailored black suit, skinny black tie, shimmering purple shirt, a hatwith a skinny brim, and a long beige coat. The sight of Amy and her dashing newboyfriend set envious tongues wagging, especially among the clique ofcheerleaders at the end of the hallway.“Who is that?” asked Linda.“Oh, that’s Bruce Lee,” answered Sue Ann Kay. “Isn’t he beautiful?”“Um, yeah,” the cheerleaders collectively swooned.“It’s like he walked straight out of West Side Story,” one of them giggled.“Yes, he looks like George Chakiris,” said Linda, “suave, debonair, big city.”“He’s here to lecture in Mr. Wilson’s class on Chinese philosophy,” Sue Annsaid.“How do you know him?” Linda asked.“I take kung fu lessons from him.”The girls burst out laughing: “I bet.” “Is that what you call it?”Linda’s eyes followed Bruce as he walked down the hall, laughing and talking andthrowing playful punches with some of the kids. She was more than a littleimpressed.That summer Linda took a job with her mom at Sears as she prepared to enter theUniversity of Washington in the fall. Her thoughts often turned to Bruce Lee.She would tease her friend about her dreamy kung fu teacher: “Is he why you arestudying all that strange self-defense stuff?”“Why don’t you come to a lesson with me and see what it’s like,” Sue Ann dared.One Sunday morning in August 1963, Linda went with Sue Ann to Chinatown. Theyoung women entered a run-down building on King Street through a half door thatfaced the sidewalk, went down a dingy, dark staircase, and emerged in a basementroom with concrete walls, bare light bulbs, and no other decoration. Lindathought to herself, “Oh brother! What did I get myself into now?” It would notbe the last time she had such a thought.Despite the surroundings, the atmosphere in the room was cheerful and welcoming.A dozen students were talking and stretching before class started. Sue Annsaluted Bruce, who had recently returned from Hong Kong, as he came over togreet them. Initially, Linda found him to be a bit cocky, but if anything thismade him even more attractive to a young woman who often struggled withself-doubt. She joined the club and became a regular pretty face in Bruce’sclasses. “I don’t know if I was more interested in kung fu or the teacher,” shesays.After Sunday morning classes, Bruce would take a group of students out for along, joyous Chinese lunch. “Bruce used to make me laugh till I hurt,” Lindarecalls. Food was frequently followed by a film, usually a samurai movie. “Allthe while Bruce would provide a running commentary about the action,” Lindawryly notes. One weekend Bruce thrilled the group by taking them to see hisfinal film, The Orphan (1960). None of them knew Bruce had been a child star inHong Kong. As they entered the theater, Bruce just offhandedly said, “Oh yeah,I’m in the movie.” Bruce may have played it off like it was no big deal, but theexperience bowled Linda over: “Seeing him on the screen in a theater inSeattle’s Chinatown made me realize there was more to this man than I hadthought.”When the 1963 fall semester at the University of Washington rolled around, Lindaenrolled as a premed student and signed up for some intense science courses.Instead of hitting the books, however, she spent much of her time hanging aroundBruce and his followers. Soon Linda was cutting classes and her freshman yearnearly turned into a disaster. “Studying, and becoming captivated by Bruce werenot compatible,” she says. But as gaga as she was for him, she never consideredherself glamorous enough for him to return her affection. “He was so dashing andcharming, he could have had his choice of dates,” she says.Little did she know that Bruce was rebounding from a broken heart at the handsof a flashy woman who was not that into him. Being worshipped was a nice changeof pace for the prideful young man with big plans. Once the fall semesterstarted, Bruce moved his Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute from its dingy basement inChinatown to 4750 University Way near the campus. It was the largest and mostexpensive place he had ever rented, nearly three thousand square feet occupyingthe entire ground floor of an apartment building. In the back was a smallbedroom. After three years busing tables, Bruce officially gave Ruby Chow hisnotice and moved out of her broom closet. He was now all in on his dream tobecome the Ray Kroc of kung fu. He needed a helpmate. Who better than a besotteddisciple?One afternoon on the University of Washington’s outdoor concert green, fenced inby trees and Grecian columns on one end, Bruce and his kung fu students wereracing from one end to the other. When Linda lagged behind the rest of thestudents, Bruce tackled her to the ground. She thought he was going to show hera new kung fu maneuver, but instead he held her down. When she finally stoppedlaughing, he asked if she wanted to go to dinner at the Space Needle.She paused, thinking it was an expensive place for the entire class, and asked,“You mean all of us?”“No, only you and me,” he replied.Stunned, she was only able to nod yes in response.On the afternoon of October 15, 1963, Linda, who knew her mother wouldn’tapprove of her dating a Chinese guy, told her she was spending the night at herfriend’s house. Once Linda arrived she borrowed one of her friend’s fashionabledresses and coats, because she didn’t own anything appropriate to wear to thehottest restaurant in town. The Space Needle had just been built for the 1962Seattle World’s Fair and its revolving restaurant towered over the city.Bruce pulled up to her friend’s house that evening in his black, souped-up ’57Ford. He was wearing the same outfit he had worn to Garfield High the first timeLinda had seen him—the black custom-tailored suit and shimmering purple shirt.He reminded her once again of her screen idol George Chakiris, the leader of theSharks in West Side Story. “I was instantly charmed,” she recalls.Prior to the date, Linda was nervous about how she might keep up a conversationwith the object of her desire now that she was going to be alone with him anddid not have the security of the group. Bruce solved that concern. “He couldalways talk enough for the both of us,” she recalls. He regaled her with hislife story but he was most excited to discuss his future plans for a chain ofkung fu schools. Linda wanted to ask him why he had picked her to ask out butwas too shy to bring it up. She did not realize at the time that he was sellingher on his dreams. “I was totally captivated by his magnetism and the energywhich flowed from him,” she says.After dinner, Bruce presented her with a memento, a tiny Scandinavian kewpiedoll. Bruce had braided the doll’s hair into pigtails, because Linda oftenwalked into the Student Union Building with wet hair in pigtails after herswimming class. As he dropped her off down the block from her home he lightlykissed her on the mouth. “It was the end of the perfect evening,” Linda says.Five days later he wrote her this love note: “To the sweetest girl, from the manwho appreciates her: To live content with small means; to seek elegance ratherthan luxury, and refinement rather than fashion, to be worthy, not respectable,and wealthy, not rich; to study hard, think quietly, talk gently, act frankly;to bear all cheerfully, do all bravely, await occasions, hurry never. In otherwords, to let the spiritual, unbidden and unconscious grow up through thecommon. Bruce.”Linda was sold.In secret from her mother, she was soon splitting her time between Bruce’s kungfu classes and his windowless bedroom. “You could sleep forever in the roombecause the sun never appeared to let you know the time of day,” Linda says. Shewould often pick Bruce up in the morning only to discover he was still asleepwith no clue what time it was. The two of them got hooked on soap operas. Everyday after classes, they’d run back to his place to watch General Hospital.Afterward Bruce would take her to the Chinese restaurant across the street wherethe cook, Ah Sam, would make Bruce his favorite meal—oyster sauce beef andshrimp with black bean sauce. Then Linda would have to go home and try to eat afull dinner again with her family. “My mother was beginning to think I wasanorexic because I ate such small portions,” she says.Her first year of college became a clandestine operation of juggling herhush-hush boyfriend and her suspicious mother. “It took quite a bit ofmaneuvering and a little help from my friends,” Linda recalls. In the process,her schoolwork fell through the cracks. “It’s your fault I’m not getting my workdone,” she complained to him. He would smile and lend a hand on her Englishpapers. He was no help at all in chemistry or calculus, but he was a prolificwriter, knocking out essays during the commercials.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Now that Bruce had a serious girlfriend who was invested in his dreams, heturned his attention to professionalizing his operation. He issued a prospectusfor his Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute. The regular fee was $22 per month and $17 forjuniors. The illustrated prospectus warned that kung fu could not be mastered inthree easy lessons. Intelligent thinking and hard work were required.Emphasizing the simplicity of his Wing Chun–based style, he promised that“techniques are smooth, short, and extremely fast; they are direct, to the pointand are stripped down to their essential purpose without any wasted motions.” Ina pitch directed at a more upscale, suburban market, he promised that kung fuwould develop confidence, humility, coordination, adaptability, and respect forothers. He did not mention street fighting.Bruce Lee was as much a salesman as he was a showman. As a child actor he hadlearned from an early age how to work the media. When he first came to Americaone of his odd jobs was as a newspaper “stuffer” (inserting loose advertisementsinside the printed pages) for The Seattle Times. Within a year he was stuffingquotes inside Seattle Times profiles of him—a remarkable achievement given howbigoted the paper was at the time. The jaw-dropping Chinglish headline for hisfirst interview was: “Lee Hopes for Rotsa Ruck.”  The reporter, Weldon Johnson,opened with this line: “At first Kung Fu sounds like a variety of Chow Mein. Andafter you think about it, you’re pretty sure it is—but it really isn’t.” In thearticle, Bruce makes a public case for why the University of Washington shouldinclude kung fu as part of its curriculum. Weldon, who apparently foundChinglish hilarious, concluded by noting that if this were to happen it would“make Lee, Kung Fu and Chow Mein manufacturers velly happy.”Bruce quickly realized that the best way to put American reporters at ease wasto appropriate hoary Oriental jokes and tell them himself. “I don’t drink orsmoke, but I do chew gum,” he liked to pun with interviewers, “because Fu ManChu.” Another of his favorites: “Seven hundred million Chinese can’t be Wong.” The strategy worked. He began to receive positive coverage for his TVappearances and public performances. Reporters found him charming, notthreatening.The good publicity and his hard work helped put his Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute inthe black. By the end of his junior year, he had more than fifty students,enough to cover his expenses and place a little extra spending money in hispocket. His girlfriend was enthusiastic about supporting his career. “I was theyin to his yang, generally quieter and calmer,” she recalls. “It seemed onlynatural that I should occasionally run interference for him so that he coulddevote his time to his work.” His assistant instructor, Taky Kimura, was trustedand respected—someone Bruce could put in charge while he was away. It was timeto expand his empire. Seattle was too provincial and had too few potentialstudents to support another school. If he wanted to make his mark and make aliving teaching martial arts, he would have to open his second branch in theepicenter of kung fu in America—the Bay Area. To do that, Bruce would need apartner.Image [../images/sec.jpg]In his mid-forties and a welder by trade, James Yimm Lee was a hard man—a harddrinker and fighter. As a teenager, he had been a gymnast, weightlifter, andamateur boxer. Throughout his twenties and thirties, he studied jujitsu and SilLum kung fu. His specialty was Iron Palm. He could stack up five bricks, ask youwhich one you wanted him to break, and then shatter your pick while leaving therest intact. Beneath his tough-as-nails exterior was a gentler, moreintellectual side. Seeing there were very few English-language martial artsbooks available to enthusiasts, he began self-publishing his own titles andselling them through his mail-order business. His first work was Modern Kung FuKarate: Iron, Poison Hand Training, which Bruce Lee bought and readcover-to-cover.After the modest success of his first title, James agreed to publish a book onSil Lum kung fu with his teacher, T. Y. Wong, one of San Francisco’s mostvenerated masters. The two men fell out over the proceeds. Master Wong accusedJames of shorting him $10. Jimmy denied it, became furious, and left Wong’skwoon forever. With his business partner, Al Novak, one of the few Caucasianswith extensive kung fu training at the time, James decided to set up his ownschool. The two of them were sick of traditional kung fu’s fancy forms, whichthey believed were impractical in real-life encounters, and decided to offer amore current curriculum by applying a boxing gym setting to kung fu instruction.They opened the East Wing Modern Kung Fu Club in a dilapidated space on Broadwayand Garnet Street in Oakland. As with Bruce in Seattle, their first studentswere mostly non-Chinese looking for more realistic training—cops, bouncers, andstreet fighters.When their school failed to attract enough members to cover the rent, theychanged the venue to James’s two-car garage on 3039 Monticello Avenue. It was asmaller and less convenient space, and James’s wife, Katherine, complained aboutthe holes James and his crew were accidentally punching and kicking into thewalls while sparring. James needed to find a way to attract more students andmove his club out of his home. He considered bringing in a new teacher.For the last few years, people close to James had been singing the praises ofBruce Lee. His brother-in-law, Robert, and his friend George Lee had both takencha-cha dance lessons with Bruce when he first came to America in 1959 and beenamazed by his Wing Chun demonstrations. In 1962, another friend, Wally Jay, hadvisited Bruce’s school in Seattle while traveling with his judo team andreturned deeply impressed by what he had witnessed. Wally’s words carried weightwith James. Not only was he one of the most respected martial arts instructorsin the Bay Area, but Wally also had an eye for talent. His biannual luau servedas a showcase for some of the best martial artists in the Bay Area.James called his old high school buddy Allen Joe. The two of them shared aninterest in bodybuilding and martial arts and often trained together. Allen wasplanning a trip with his family to Seattle for the 1962 World’s Fair.“When you get there, will you look up this Bruce Lee kid for me?” James asked.“Scout him out and see if he’s as good as everyone says.”Allen and his family arrived to a city in the thick of World’s Fair mania.Seattle was overrun with tourists—traffic was jammed, lines were long, andhotels sold out. Fortuitously, the hotel Allen had booked was only a half blockfrom Ruby Chow’s restaurant. After a day maneuvering his children through thecolossal crowds at the World of Science and the World of Century 21 exhibits,Allen Joe plopped down at the bar at Ruby Chow’s and ordered a single maltScotch.“Is Bruce Lee here?” Allen asked the waitress who delivered his drink.“He is off for the night,” she replied, “but will probably be back after 11:00p.m.”Well into his second drink, Allen looked up and saw the waitress pointing to adapper, handsome, and bespectacled young man. Sizing up his slight frame andneatly pressed gray flannel suit, Allen Joe was incredulous. “That . . . isBruce Lee?” he thought to himself. “The kid looks like a fashion model.”“Are you Bruce Lee?” Allen Joe asked as Bruce approached the bar.“Who wants to know?” he responded suspiciously.“I was told about you from Robert and Harriet Lee. They took dance lessons fromyou in Oakland,” Allen explained, trying to put Bruce at ease. “They said youare pretty good at Gung Fu.”Those were the magic words. Bruce’s face lit up with excitement as he asked,“You practice Gung Fu?”“Yes, with Robert’s brother-in-law, James Lee.”Bruce was all smiles now. “Come on, let’s get a bite to eat.”Bruce led Allen out of Ruby Chow’s and down the block toward a hamburger jointwith Bruce delivering his life story at a fast clip. He explained how he hadbeen teaching kung fu in Seattle for the past three years. He also recounted hismeeting with Wally Jay and his admiration for the jujitsu master.As Bruce paused his narration, Allen Joe jumped in to explain that he was hereat the behest of James Lee, a serious practitioner who ran his own school, builthis own equipment, and even published his own martial arts books.“You mean, THE James Lee?” Bruce gushed. “I own all his books!”“Would you like to meet him?” Allen asked.“Absolutely,” Bruce said.As they reached the door to the burger joint, Bruce stopped Allen on thesidewalk.“Before we go in,” Bruce told him, “I want you to try to hit me as hard as youcan.”The next day, Allen Joe called James Lee to report the encounter. He kept hisappraisal short and simple: “James, the kid is amazing.”With this confirmation, James set up a phone call with Bruce and invited him tostay at his house the next time he was down to visit. As soon as Bruce couldrearrange his work and class schedule, he jumped into his black Ford and drovetwelve hours south to Oakland.The two men greeted each other at James’s doorstep. It was an unlikely pairing.James was old enough to be Bruce’s father. But both of them were former teenagestreet fighters who were obsessed with the martial arts and contemptuous of theclassical approach to teaching it. They wanted to create something new.James warmly welcomed Bruce and invited him inside to meet his wife and childrenover tea in the living room. Once the formalities were over, James ushered Bruceinto his California garage filled with his inventions—self-made martial artstraining equipment. Bruce pointed to a spring-loaded punching board and askedwith boyish zeal, “So, how does this thing work?” Soon the entire house wasshaking as the two men pounded the various contraptions in the garage.After working up a sweat, Bruce turned to James and said, “Try to hit me as hardas you can.”Bruce dominated James as easily as he had everyone in Seattle. The next day,James Lee called Allen Joe to report the encounter. He also kept his appraisalshort and simple: “Allen, the kid is amazing.”Over the next year, Bruce and James built a strong friendship and slowlyrecognized the benefits of teaming up. For Bruce, James was an establishedfigure with extensive connections in the Bay Area scene. For James, Bruce was ayoung genius who was inventing a new style of martial arts that modifiedtradition for the realities of street combat. He also saw in Bruce someone whomight be able to attract enough students to open a proper kwoon.In the spring of 1963, James agreed to turn his tiny two-car-garage school intothe second branch of Bruce’s Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute. The plan was for Bruce,once he finished his junior year in June 1964, to come down to Oakland for thesummer to help James open a new franchise in a new location. Bruce would be thehead instructor and James his assistant. The force of Bruce’s talent andpersonality had turned a much older and more established martial artist into oneof his students. “The superiority of his gung fu is more refined and effectivethan that which I have learned in all my years,” James proclaimed. “I havechanged all my gung fu techniques to his methods.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]To cement their relationship, publicize their upcoming venture, and generatesome much-needed cash, James and Bruce agreed to publish a book together. It wasthe first and only one Bruce Lee authored during his lifetime. In 1963, therewere only a handful of English-language books about Chinese martial arts. Jamesand Bruce planned for their book, Chinese Gung Fu: The Philosophical Art ofSelf-Defense, to be the first in a series—an introductory primer and trainingmanual for beginners. The book opened with author testimonials from James Lee,Wally Jay, and Ed Parker, one of the most influential martial artists in thecountry. Bruce emphasized his philosophical perspective on kung fu with a shortessay on the Taoist principles of yin and yang. The bulk of the book was acollection of illustrated drawings and photographs of basic kung fu techniques,most of them from styles other than Wing Chun.For the photo shoot, Bruce invited his original Seattle crew—Jesse Glover,Charlie Wu, and Taky Kimura—to perform in the parking lot next to Ruby Chow’srestaurant. Bruce directed all the action, staging each shot for the cameraman.It all went smoothly until the cover photo. As Bruce stood with one leg bent andthe other extended straight out into the air, the camera malfunctioned. As thephotographer anxiously tried to correct the flaw, Bruce yelled at him, much tothe amusement of his crew, “Hurry up and fix the damn thing before my leg fallsoff!”It cost $600 to print one thousand copies, which James sold through hismail-order business for $5. Profits from the book helped Bruce pay off variousexpenses. “His primary reason for doing the book was that he needed the money,”Jesse says.A secondary reason was to declare war on traditional kung fu styles. James wasstill furious that his old master, T. Y. Wong, had accused James of stiffinghim. But he was even angrier that everything he had learned from T. Y. Wong wasuseless against Bruce’s more modern approach. “Jimmy spent years training inclassical gung fu,” says Gary Cagaanan, a longtime student of James’s, “and hefelt, after having met and trained with Bruce, that he’d wasted precious yearslearning sets and forms and not learning how to fight.”In a direct shot at the classical styles taught in San Francisco, Bruce andJames included a section entitled “Difference in Gung Fu Styles,” in which Bruceopened by writing, “The technique of a superior system of Gung Fu is based onsimplicity. It is only the half-cultivated systems that are full of unnecessarywasted motions.” What followed was a photo-by-photo case study of Brucedismantling the exact same techniques T. Y. Wong had championed in the book hehad published with James. The insult was not lost on T. Y. Wong or the SanFrancisco kung fu community. After the book became available, Master Wong toldhis students Bruce Lee was “a dissident with bad manners.”Initially Bruce was extremely proud to be a published author. He sent a signedcopy to his old Wing Chun friend and mentor, William Cheung, in Hong Kong.William, who remembered Bruce as a punkish teenager, was taken aback that his“little brother” was presenting himself as a master in America. To put him backin his place, William, somewhat enviously, disparaged the quality of the book.“Your letter is kind of stressing doubt on our friendship,” Bruce replied, stungby the criticism. “The book you read is a basic book I’ve written somewhere in1963 and I’m in the process of completing a much more thorough book on the Taoof Gung Fu.”Bruce never got around to finishing this follow-up volume, although he continuedto write extensive notes for it the rest of his life. Some of these notes werepublished posthumously as The Tao of Jeet Kune Do. Over the years Bruce grewembarrassed of his first book, because his unpolished debut gave the impressionhe was a traditional kung fu practitioner. “So great was his need to liberatehimself from classical martial arts in later years,” says Linda, “he asked thepublishers to cease production of this book.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]With all of his trips to Oakland during his junior year, Bruce was increasinglydistracted and floundering academically. He was only taking two classes persemester and was not on track to graduate on time, even if he managed to improvehis lousy grades. Anxious to launch his kung fu empire, he made the decision towithdraw from the University of Washington after his junior year and move inwith James and his family in Oakland. He told friends he intended to completecollege in California.Bruce asked Taky Kimura to run the Seattle branch of the Jun Fan Gung FuInstitute while he established the Oakland franchise. Bruce promised to visitSeattle whenever possible to teach seminars and update Kimura on new techniques,but he planned to base himself in the Bay Area until an opportunity arose tostart a new franchise in another city.Bruce timed his arrival in Oakland for Wally Jay’s summer luau. The Hawaiianparty, held at Colombo Hall, was expected to draw over a thousand ticket buyersfor the food, singing, and martial arts performances. On the bill were “Hawaiiansongbird” Lena Machado and a little-known kung fu instructor from Seattle. Itwas Bruce and James’s first opportunity to publicize their partnership.Weaving his way past platters of roasted pig, huge trays of chicken long-rice,ten-gallon pots of poi, and plates of lomi lomi salmon and sliced pineapples,Bruce made his way to the stage. He ignored the stairs and just leapt onto theraised platform. Without pause he launched into a traditional kung fu form. Hismovements were fluid and popped with contained power. The crowd watchedpolitely, thinking the young man showed promise but he was nothing special.As if sensing the mood of the crowd, Bruce stopped in the middle of the form,turned to the audience, and asked in a cocky, condescending voice, “How couldyou expect to fight like that?”  The abrupt change in tone caught everyoneoff-guard, especially the traditional martial arts people in the crowd. “Thereis no way a person is going to fight you in the street with a set pattern.”Stepping back he launched into a Northern Shaolin form complete with widecrescent kicks over his head. Again, he stopped mid-form to criticize what he’djust expertly performed. “Classical methods like these are a form of paralysis.Too many practitioners are just blindly rehearsing these systematic routines andstunts.”There was red-faced grumbling from the crowd. They had expected a dynamicdemonstration, perhaps leavened with some corny jokes, not a lecture full ofput-downs. “His demonstration of the ineffectiveness of traditional forms upsetand embarrassed the traditionalists in the audience,” remembers Leo Fong, afriend and student of James’s.“My approach is scientific street fighting,” Bruce declared as he let loose aflurry of Wing Chun punches. “These techniques are smooth, short, and extremelyfast—stripped down to their essential purpose without any wasted motions. Doesanyone think he can block one of my punches?”Immediately two volunteers, big football player types, charged up the stairs.Smiling at their size and making a joke about their eagerness, Bruce pulled thefirst one close to him and explained to him and the crowd, “I’m going to startfrom seven feet away, close the gap between us, and tap you on the foreheadwithout you blocking my hand. Got it?”“Got it,” the first volunteer replied.“Are you ready?”“Yes.”In a blur, Bruce launched himself across the stage and tagged the footballplayer’s forehead an instant ahead of his block.“Next,” Bruce said to scattered laughter.Having seen what happened to his friend, the second volunteer raised his handsin tense anticipation. As soon as Bruce twitched, the guy swept a block acrosshis face. Bruce reassessed in microseconds, waiting for the block to pass,before thumping him on the forehead.A mixture of applause and hard stares followed Bruce as he left the stage. Whilehis talent was obvious, many felt insulted. Asian martial arts etiquettedemanded public courtesy—criticism of other styles was reserved for privateconversations. “Bruce had speed and coordination like no one I had ever seen,”Leo Fong recalls. “But I worried his attitude was gonna lead to trouble.”James wasn’t concerned at all. He loved that his young partner had stuck a thumbin the eye of the classicists. After the performance, James gleefully invitedhis students and close friends over to his house on Monday for a private meetingwith Bruce.Gathered on that evening were many of James’s current students and others whowere open to a more modern approach to the martial arts: Al Novak, Leo Fong,George Lee, and a newcomer from Stockton named Bob Baker. James informed thegroup that he and Bruce were going to start a new school together. James wasmoving operations from his garage to a new location on Broadway Avenue alongOakland’s “Auto Row” and hoped to open in about a month.To close the sale with the group, Bruce demonstrated a technique none of themhad ever seen before—his one-inch punch. He moved the coffee table to the side,grabbed a hefty Oakland phone book, handed it to Bob Baker, the tallest man inthe room, and instructed him to hold it tight against his chest. Standing infront of Bob, Bruce extended his right hand until his middle finger touched thephone book, then curled his hand into a fist, an inch or two from the target. Inthat moment everyone seemed to inhale in unison as Bruce snapped his hips,straightened his back leg, and drove his fist, faster than the eye could see,into the phone book.The group was stunned. “Bruce knocked him over the couch,” recalls Leo Fong,“and Baker’s legs went straight up and over. I thought he’d go through theliving room window.”Bruce explained that real punching power was generated not from the shoulder andarms but from the entire body working in unison. The more the muscles relaxed,he said, the more power they could generate—softness combining with hardnesslike yin and yang. “The martial arts should be functional and practical,” Brucesaid. “The classical mess does not stifle me.”Bruce’s performance and modern perspective captivated the room. “This youngmartial artist was way ahead of his time,” Leo Fong says.Seeing the effect Bruce’s talent had on everyone, James smiled and updated thegroup on the schedule. “Until the new school is ready, we’ll continue practicingin the garage,” he explained. “Classes resume tomorrow.”On July 24, 1964, James and Bruce filed a simple permit with the city to openthe Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute, which they described as a “Chinese Self-DefenseSchool,” on 4157 Broadway. Formerly an upholstery store, it was a humble space,located on the first floor of a two-story brick building. Bruce wanted it to bean exclusive club. No signage was put out front. The only way to hear about itwas word-of-mouth. Anyone who wanted to join had to apply and be screened byBruce. He only accepted advanced, dedicated students with high moral character.Anyone who answered the question “Why do you want to learn martial arts?” with aviolent answer like “Because I want to beat up my neighbor” was rejected. It wasan unusual way to launch a new venture. Because of the strictness of theadmission process and Bruce’s relative obscurity as an instructor, the schoolstruggled to sign up new members.As his own skills advanced, Bruce became increasingly convinced that one styledoes not fit all. For example, taller fighters required different techniquesthan shorter, faster students than slower, more aggressive personalities thanmore timid. Bruce tailored his instruction to the specific strengths of eachstudent. “Bruce showed me some moves that were not taught to the majority of theclass and he told me to keep them to myself,” says George Lee. “He felt thatsince no one person was the same each individual needed different teaching.”Bruce didn’t believe a student should bend to tradition but rather the traditionto the individual. As a result, his classes, although strict, were informal.Sometimes he would work out and other times he would lecture. He didn’t linepeople up to practice set moves in unison like in Japanese karate. He preferredto pair people up to practice techniques and spar. His motto was: “Develop thetools, refine the tools, then dissolve the tools.”While Bruce had set up this second branch to fit his preferences as aninstructor, it was not an ideal business model. They were only charging $15 permonth for training. Seven or eight students were not enough to cover the rent.To attract more members and survive as a teacher, he was going to have to make aname for himself and do it soon, because his responsibilities were about to getmuch heavier.Image [../images/sec.jpg]A tried and true way for a young man to knock up his girlfriend is to tell herhe’s leaving for someplace so dangerous he might never come back. Vietnam,perhaps, or even worse, Oakland. Normal precautions tend to be disregarded. Andso it was with Bruce and Linda. They had been dating in secret for eight months.As the date of his departure in July 1964 approached, weeks of tearful goodbyesex led to the discovery that Linda was pregnant.Linda claims that Bruce “was happy” about the news. While he may have presenteda cheery face to her, he was uncertain what to do. Linda was dreadfully in lovewith him, but his career had barely begun. It was the reverse of hisrelationship with Amy Sanbo. This time he was the one with doubts. “The idea ofcommitment scared him to death,” Linda recalls. “He wanted to be financiallysecure before undertaking the responsibilities of a wife and family.”The situation remained unresolved as Taky Kimura chauffeured Bruce and hisdistraught, pregnant girlfriend to the airport. Standing at the gate forOakland, Bruce saw the tears in Linda’s eyes. He said simply, “I’ll be back,”and then he was gone.It felt to Linda like the bottom had dropped out of her life. Her stomachchurned. Fears raced through her mind. “What if I never see him again?” shethought. “What if he feels trapped? What if he changes his mind? What if he goeson to bigger and better things and forgets about me?”Over a series of phone calls, Bruce sought the counsel of Taky Kimura, his mosttrusted friend and advisor. Taky told Bruce he should marry her—he wouldn’t finda better wife. “I respected Linda highly,”  Taky says. “She was sincere,devoted, and had depth.”After two and half months of agonizing, Bruce finally made a decision. He wroteto Linda and told her he wanted her with him and would return to Seattle to gether. Linda was elated. Bruce slowly warmed to the idea. For years he had worriedthat his undescended testicle might mean he was infertile. He was delighted hewould be a father. “He wanted a child,” Linda says. “That was very important tohim. This child would be his.” He became more excited after convincing himselfthat the child would be a boy. “In fact, we only chose a boy’s name for theunborn baby,” Bruce later said. “We didn’t even bother thinking of a girl’sname.” Given how highly prized male heirs were in Chinese society, this wasBruce’s chance to make his dad proud. While Peter might have been his father’sfavorite, Bruce was certain he would be the one to provide Li Hoi Chuen with hisfirst grandson.The obstacle the young couple faced was Linda’s family, especially her mother,who had no idea about the relationship or even Bruce’s existence. To keep itclandestine, Linda had gone so far as to set up a private post office box inSeattle, so Bruce could write her in secret. “Bruce and I decided on thecoward’s way out,” Linda says. “We’d get married, run away to Oakland, then callmy mom and tell her. A friend of mine had done this a couple of months earlierand after the dust had settled, everyone had survived.”Because he couldn’t afford a wedding ring, James Lee’s wife, Katherine, loanedBruce hers for the ceremony. He returned to Seattle on Wednesday, August 12,with the borrowed ring. Bruce and Linda went to the King County Courthouse toapply for a marriage license. The law required blood tests and a three-day waitbefore a couple could marry. This turned out to be the undoing of their covertoperation. The young couple did not realize that the local newspaper publishedmarriage applicants’ names in its Vital Statistics section nor did they knowthat Linda’s maiden aunt Sally was a devoted reader of that section. No soonerhad her old eyes lit upon a family scandal than she was dialing Linda’s mom totell her that Linda C. Emery and a Bruce J. F. Lee had declared their intent tomarry. Vivian marched into Linda’s room, shook the newspaper in her face, andyelled, “What’s this! Is this you?”Her mother called a family powwow to change her daughter’s mind. Two aunts, oneuncle, a grandmother, and her stepfather showed up for this come-to-Jesusmeeting. “They arrived on Saturday and we all sat around the living room as ifthere had been a death in the family,” Linda says. “It was awful.”Bruce had never liked keeping the relationship a secret, only agreeing atLinda’s insistence. And he most certainly hated being told what he could andcouldn’t do.“I want to marry your daughter. We are leaving on Monday,” Bruce declared to herhostile family. “I’m Chinese, by the way.”The joke didn’t lighten the mood. Race was the underlying issue for the familyand the country. Miscegenation was the gay marriage of that era. While the stateof Washington had long allowed interracial marriages, it was still illegal inseventeen other states. It wasn’t until 1967 that the Supreme Court outlawed allantimiscegenation laws in the aptly named case, Loving v. Virginia.“If you marry, you will suffer prejudice,” one of the aunts argued. “And so willyour children.”“Times are changing,” Linda argued.“Not that fast.”“Maybe not, but I don’t care.”“How long has this been going on?” Linda’s mother demanded.“A year.”“You’ve been lying to me for a year?” Mrs. Emery cried out. “After everythingI’ve done for you, how could you do that to me?”“I’m sorry, I knew you wouldn’t understand.”Her uncle turned to Bruce. “How will you support her? What do you do for aliving?”“I teach gung fu,” Bruce proudly declared.“You teach what?”“What about college?” Linda’s mother asked her. “You’re a good student, premed.What about your dream of becoming a doctor?”“School can wait,” Linda said.“What’s the rush? Why can’t this wait?”Neither Bruce nor Linda would answer.Sensing a secret, her furious stepfather charged up to her room and ransacked ituntil he found a shoebox filled with the couple’s correspondence. Once he readtheir letters, he returned downstairs and announced to her mother, “Yourprecious daughter is pregnant.”Surprisingly, this revelation didn’t change the family’s mind. “Why don’t youput marriage off for a year?” the assemblage argued. “Have your baby and thensee how you feel.”  They would rather Linda be a single mother and raise abastard child than marry a ne’er-do-well Chinaman.“I will not wait,” Linda declared.As the hours wore on and the tears and recriminations flowed, her uncle offeredto take Linda for a drive to reason with her. Her uncle considered himself adevout Christian. “This is against God’s word,” he told her in the car. “Goddoesn’t want the races to mix. You are committing a sin.”“God loves all his children,” Linda responded.Her uncle quoted Deuteronomy 7:3–4, “You shall not intermarry with them, givingyour daughters to their sons or taking their daughters for your sons, for theywould turn away your sons from following me, to serve other gods. Then the angerof the Lord would be kindled against you, and he would destroy you.”“I don’t believe that,” she quietly replied. “Everyone is equal in the eyes ofthe Lord, and God commands us to treat everyone equally.”“If you do this,” her uncle warned, “you will be kicked out of the family.”If Saturday was bad, the intervention on Sunday was even worse. “A perfectlyhorrible day,” Linda recalls. “This was the day of tears.” Any pretense ofpersuasion was gone. All the arguments had been gone over and over again. It wasnow a battle of wills. The family threatened her with banishment, and Lindainsisted nothing could change her mind. She had fought too hard to win Bruce.She wasn’t going to give him up for anyone, even her family. “I had decided Iwas not going to be talked out of it,” she recalls.Exhausted and frustrated, her mother tried to dissuade Bruce with her strongestput-down: “You don’t want to marry Linda. She doesn’t know how to cook. Shedoesn’t know how to clean, iron, or sew. She doesn’t know how to do anything.”“She’ll learn,” Bruce said.And that was that. Realizing she had lost and unwilling to disown her beloveddaughter, Vivian tossed in the towel. “If you are going to get married, it hasto be in a church.”Vivian had stopped going to church years back, but if her daughter was going tomarry, the wedding needed to be sanctified. Vivian considered herself the familyhistorian. She had detailed records of births, marriages, and deaths. Herdaughter’s wedding had to be properly recorded.Linda and Bruce agreed to a church wedding. Arrangements were quickly made withthe minister of Seattle’s Congregational Church. On August 17, 1964, theminister performed the rushed service. There were no flowers. Linda wore asleeveless, brown, floral dress and Bruce his favorite Hong Kong–tailored suit.Taky Kimura was Bruce’s best man. Only Linda’s mother and her grandmother showedup from her side. The conservative Christian uncle drove back to Everett andrefused to attend, as did the rest of her family. (When Linda saw that uncleagain about ten years after Bruce’s death, he put his arm around her and said,“Welcome back to the family.”) When the service was over, Vivian complained,“Bruce could have brought some flowers, anyway.”As Linda had anticipated, the dust eventually settled and everyone survived.Bruce was able to charm Linda’s mother and she grew to love him dearly. He wouldjoke, “You know, Mom, you’ve got the greatest legs of any woman of your age I’veever seen!” Linda impressed Bruce’s siblings and friends with her steadiness andcalm strength. “As a bachelor, Bruce liked to have affairs with beautiful,flashy girls, but he married a quiet, sensitive girl who knew how to listen andwould let him have his way,” Peter said. “He knew what real beauty was, and heknew she would take care of the family. Although Linda is American, she is very,very similar in character to many Chinese girls.” Bruce concurred, telling areporter in 1966, “Linda is more Oriental than some of the Chinese I know. Sheis quiet, calm, and doesn’t yak-yak-yak all the time.”Bruce avoided a conflict with his own parents by not telling them he wasmarrying a non-Chinese girl until after the wedding. His father and mother werenot pleased. He had to spend months convincing them everything was okay beforethey agreed Linda was welcome in Hong Kong. “If she is your choice,” his motherfinally conceded, “then she is our choice.”Without perhaps intending it, Bruce had followed in his father’s footsteps andmarried a woman quite similar to his mother. Both Linda Emery and Grace Ho werewenrou (Image [../images/ch-13.jpg])—quiet, gentle, and tender. Both fell inlove with actors after watching one of their charismatic performances. Bothwomen vigorously pursued the object of their adoration. And both defied theirfamilies to marry broke Chinamen with big dreams.The main difference was the unexpected pregnancy. That Bruce consented to marryLinda, despite his reservations, made her even more devoted to him. “I wascertainly not the type of beauty, which Bruce usually dated before ourmarriage,” she says. “But I could give him repose, tranquility, understanding,and true love.” She learned how to be the perfect partner for a brilliant,volatile, and extroverted man, and he came to love her for it. “We are twohalves that make a whole,” Bruce told friends.Marrying Linda turned out to be the best decision Bruce made in his life.“Nobody has ever given Linda the credit she deserves. This woman has been onehell of a pillar of strength,” says Taky Kimura, expressing a widely held view.“I don’t think Bruce would have aspired to the heights that he did without hersupport.”The heights would come later. At the present moment, the newlyweds were twocollege dropouts with a baby on the way and barely a dime between them. Theymoved in with Jimmy’s family to save money. In return, Linda served as a nannyto Jimmy’s children and nursemaid to his wife, Katherine, who had recently beendiagnosed with a terminal case of cancer."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f0144-01.jpg]This photo of Wong Jack Man appeared in a front-page story about his challengefight with Bruce Lee in the Chinese Pacific Weekly on January 28, 1965.(Courtesy of Robert Louie)Image [../images/f0144-02.jpg]Bruce with James Yimm Lee, who crafted the tombstone and kicking shield,November 1967. (David Tadman)"},{"pageContent":"EIGHTFACE-OFF IN OAKLAND1964 was a peak year for Japanese martial arts. Judo was accepted intocompetition at the Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Karate was one of the hottest fadsin America. Elvis Presley and Sean Connery were devoted students. At every WestCoast fair there were inevitably demonstrations of Japanese styles alongsidesquare dancers and Miss Teenage contests. Even royalty took up karate. InEurope, the kings of both Spain and Greece boasted of earning black belts.Riding the wave of karate’s popularity was Ed Parker, a thirty-three-year-oldHawaiian-born Mormon and Kenpo karate instructor with several schools in Utahand Southern California. Parker had quickly realized the best way to promote themartial arts, his dojos, and himself was to cater to the movie community. In1956, Parker opened franchises in Pasadena and Beverly Hills where he eventuallytaught so many celebrities—including Robert Wagner, Blake Edwards, RobertConrad, Natalie Wood, George Hamilton, Warren Beatty, and Elvis Presley—thatTime magazine referred to him as the “High Priest and Prophet of the HollywoodSect.” Parker parlayed his position into a minor career as a stuntman and actorwith roles in Lucille Ball’s The Lucy Show (1963), Blake Edwards’s Revenge ofthe Pink Panther (1978), and Kill the Golden Goose (1979).In the summer of 1964, Parker sought to bring his two worlds together with hisLong Beach International Karate Championships. The objective was for thecountry’s top martial artists to demonstrate and compete in front of an audienceof enthusiasts and Hollywood insiders. Parker spent the months prior to theevent sending invitations to established names and searching out new talent. Hisfriend James Lee asked Parker to come up to Oakland to check out Bruce Lee.“Jimmy knew once I observed Bruce’s extraordinary talent I would use myinfluence to help Bruce gain recognition,” says Parker. Bruce’s skills (“he madethe air pop when he hit”) and his controversial views earned him a ticket toLong Beach. “Bruce was very anti-classical,” says Parker. “So I told him that ifhe were to come down to the tournament and demonstrate, people would have abetter cross section of the martial arts world.” After years of regionaltheater, Bruce finally had his chance to perform on Broadway.When Bruce landed in Long Beach, Parker assigned Dan Inosanto, his topinstructor, to serve as his minder. “Mr. Parker gave me $75 and said, ‘Make surehe eats properly, and show him the area,’ ” recalls Inosanto. Within moments ofmeeting Inosanto, Bruce made his by now standard request: “Hit me as hard as youcan.” Dan threw his best punch. “I was completely flabbergasted!” Inosanto says.“He controlled me like a baby. I couldn’t sleep that night. It seemed as thougheverything I’d done in the past was obsolete.”The night before the tournament many of the invited performers and fightersgathered in a vacant ballroom at their hotel for an impromptu exchange oftechniques. Bruce strolled in wearing a black leather jacket and jeans. No onethere knew who he was, but Tsutomu Ohshima, the first Japanese man to teachkarate in America, took one glance at the way Bruce moved when he walked andsaid to his student, “That one is the only one here who can do anything.”The Long Beach Championships, held at the eight-thousand-seat MunicipalAuditorium on August 2, was a great success. Thousands of people showed up towatch masters from all styles and systems demonstrate and compete. Bruce, stillrelatively unknown, was one of the minor presenters, scheduled during thesluggish part of the afternoon. When he took the floor wearing a black kung fuuniform with white cuffs, the air conditioner was down and the crowd was gettingrestless in the muggy heat after watching hours of competition.Parker introduced Bruce as a practitioner of the little-known Chinese art ofkung fu. Taky Kimura joined Bruce in the center of the auditorium to serve ashis assistant. Bruce’s demonstration was a modified version of the one he’dgiven at Wally Jay’s luau. He sent a volunteer flying with his one-inch punch.He performed two-finger push-ups. He demonstrated Wing Chun self-defensetechniques and a lightning-quick sticky hands drill with Kimura.All of these were crowd-pleasers, but the centerpiece of his performance was thelecture he delivered criticizing classical systems and advocating a more modernapproach. “He got up there and began to flawlessly imitate all these otherstyles,” remembers Barney Scollan, an eighteen-year-old competitor in thetournament that morning who was disqualified for kicking his opponent in thegroin, “and then one-by-one he began to dissect them and explain why theywouldn’t work. And the things he was saying made a lot of sense. He even made anabsolute mockery of the horse stance.”In front of an audience packed with karate traditionalists, who had spentthousands of hours practicing the horse stance, Bruce fearlessly argued forliberation: “Teachers should never impose their favorite patterns on theirstudents. They should be finding out what works for them, and what does not workfor them. The individual is more important than the style.”As he intended, Bruce’s provocative performance polarized the audience. “Therewas a high percentage of people who were in awe of him,” recalls Dan Inosanto,“but then there was another group who was really upset.”Clarence Lee, a San Francisco karate instructor, says, “Guys were practicallylining up to fight Bruce Lee after his performance in Long Beach.”Just like on the Hong Kong playgrounds of his youth, Bruce’s brash manner haddivided the world into those who were for and those who were against him. “Brucemade a number of enemies that night,” says Scollan, “as well as a number offollowers.”Ed Parker, who filmed Bruce’s performance on a 16mm camera, was not fussed bythe controversy. If anything, it amused him. That night he invited Bruce to joinhim for a VIP dinner at a Chinese restaurant with Jhoon Rhee, the “Father ofAmerican Tae Kwon Do,” and Mike Stone, who had defeated Chuck Norris to win thekarate tournament. The first thing Bruce did at the restaurant was pull back hissleeves and ask everyone to feel his forearms, which were as hard as iron pipes.“My first impression was, obviously, that he was very arrogant because his talkhad put down karate people,” Mike Stone remembers, “but I actually ended upliking him very much.”The Long Beach tournament proved to be Bruce’s debutante ball, his coming outinto society. Mike Stone would become Bruce’s first high-profile student, JhoonRhee an ally and supporter, and Ed Parker a role model. His performance thatafternoon would end up launching his Hollywood career.Image [../images/sec.jpg]When Bruce returned to Hong Kong in the summer of 1963, he failed to secure amovie role for himself, but his efforts did put him back on the industry’sradar. Shaw Bros. Studio hired Bruce to accompany Diana Chang Chung-wen, as shepromoted her latest movie, The Amorous Lotus Pan, in California. Bruce’s job wasto dance the cha-cha with Diana—whose voluptuous figure and sexy demeanor earnedher the nickname “the Mandarin Marilyn Monroe”—onstage each night and to serveas a low-key bodyguard for the duration of her tour. For Bruce the gig was anopportunity to promote his kung fu schools in America. He only accepted the roleas Diana’s sidekick on the condition he be allowed to give a martial artsdemonstration at each stop.After several performances in Los Angeles, the pair made their way back to SanFrancisco in late August. Upon his return home, Bruce had a lot on his mind.James Lee was in the hospital with his dying wife, Katherine; Linda, who waspregnant, was tending to James and Katherine’s distraught children; and theOakland branch was struggling. On top of all that, he was scheduled to appear inthe Sun Sing Theatre, the same stage where his father had performed two decadesearlier. This was his best chance to recruit more students for his new school,but he knew he would be facing a hostile audience. Word of his criticism ofclassical martial arts at Wally Jay’s luau and the Long Beach KarateChampionships had spread through San Francisco’s Chinatown. A number oftraditional kung fu students and old masters bought tickets to see if thisarrogant Wing Chun practitioner would dare insult them to their faces.To lighten the tense atmosphere, Bruce opened with a joke, based on the verticalplacement of Chinese text versus English’s horizontal sentences. “Honoredguests, my new book is on sale in the lobby, which reminds me, I have noticedthat unlike the Chinese, Westerners don’t appreciate what they read. When peopleread in the East, you can see they like it,” Bruce explained, moving his head upand down as if saying yes, “but when a Westerner reads, they go like this,” nowturning his head side to side as if saying no, “because they don’t really enjoyit.”The crowd laughed, seemingly put at ease, expecting Bruce would be conciliatory.They were mistaken.Bruce called up his new stage partner, Dan Inosanto, who had traveled with Brucefrom Los Angeles. Using Inosanto as a target, Bruce emphasized the practicalityand efficiency of Wing Chun, making the point of how his system was free of somany of the wasted motions found in other traditional kung fu styles. Tounderline his assertion, he imitated some of Northern Shaolin’s wide kicks. “Whywould you kick high and leave yourself open,” he said, pausing to allow Inosantoto counter. “Instead you can kick low and punch high.”Ignoring the crowd’s discomfort, Bruce continued his criticism. “In China, 80percent of what they teach is nonsense. Here, in America, it is 90 percent.”Angry murmurs arose from the audience. “These old tigers,” he said, clearlyreferring to San Francisco’s traditional masters, “they have no teeth.”The insult was too much.A lit cigarette was angrily flicked toward the stage. More followed. It was theChinese equivalent of throwing rotten fruit.“Bruce was saying these things that were offensive to the Chinese martial arts,”explains Inosanto, “and they didn’t like that sort of attitude coming from ayoung sifu.”A man in back stood up and shouted, “That’s not kung fu!”“Sir, would you care to join me on stage so I can demonstrate?” Bruce asked witha smile.The man waved his hand in dismissal before heading for the exit: “You don’t knowkung fu!”“Would anyone else care to volunteer?” Bruce asked, anxious to win back thecrowd.A hand shot up from one of the seats near the stage. It belonged to KennethWong, a teenage kung fu student of one of San Francisco’s “old tigers.” Brucequickly motioned Kenneth to join him.“When Bruce called Kenneth up, we began cheering and hollering and egging himon,” recalls Adeline Fong, who attended the demonstration with a big group ofKenneth’s kung fu classmates.Like Bruce, Kenneth was considered a brash prodigy, as cocky as he was talented.Instead of using the stairs, Kenneth just leapt onto center stage, elicitinghowls from his friends and laughter from the rest of the audience.After thanking the teenager for participating, Bruce explained the challenge. “Iwill stand back seven feet from you, close the gap, and tap your forehead,” hesaid. “You can use either hand or both to try to block me. Do you understand?”“Yes,” Kenneth replied, his smile as wide as Bruce’s.As the two confident young men faced each other, the crowd shouted support forKenneth. Like a shot, Bruce slipped forward and jabbed his fingers at Kenneth’sforehead. Just as fast, Kenneth cleanly blocked Bruce’s hand. The audienceroared and heckled Bruce, who stepped back and motioned to go again. Annoyed athis surprising failure, Bruce went harder and faster. At the last possiblemillisecond, Bruce feinted, causing Kenneth to miss, and then cracked Kenneth’sforehead forcefully enough to knock him back a step. Kenneth angrily raised hisfists in front of him and stepped into an offensive stance. For a moment, itseemed as if a real fight was going to break out.The crowd erupted. Boos rained down from the balcony. Someone shouted, “Thatwasn’t fair!” Dozens of lit cigarettes were flicked onto the stage. Realizingthe crowd was on the verge of a riot, Bruce stepped back from Kenneth, smiled,and said, “Thank you for participating.” More cigarette butts skittered acrossthe stage.His face tight and eyes gleaming, Bruce stepped to the edge of the stage andissued a statement whose exact meaning became a hot topic of debate. “I wouldlike to let everybody know that any time my Chinatown brothers want to researchmy Wing Chun, they are welcome to find me at my school in Oakland.”Almost as soon as the words left his mouth, Bruce exited stage left. Theaudience turned to each other in surprise: did he really just issue an openchallenge to all of Chinatown?Image [../images/sec.jpg]News of Bruce’s controversial performance spread quickly and it grew with eachretelling. He had insulted all of Chinatown! So disrespectful! We must teachthis cha-cha-dancing, pretty-boy actor from Seattle a lesson! Pretty soon thepeople who hadn’t been there were even more outraged than those in the audiencethat night.One of those outraged was David Chin. He was twenty-one and a senior kung fustudent of one of the venerated San Francisco masters Bruce Lee had insulted.For weeks he urged a response. The challenge could not go unanswered. But theelders advised letting it go. The hot blood of young men led to violence, andviolence drew unwanted attention from white authorities. The ancient onesremembered the pogroms against the Chinese. They knew Chinatown’s survivaldepended on appearing unthreatening, by keeping its face inscrutable and neckbent. Some even reasoned that Bruce’s final pronouncement wasn’t intended as achallenge at all. The young man was simply advertising for his school, invitingprospective students to study under him. Besides, why should anyone in SanFrancisco care about a two-bit kung fu instructor in Oakland? His school wouldmost likely fail and when it did that would be the last anybody ever heard ofhim.David would not be dissuaded. He gathered two of his friends, Bing Chan andRonald “Ya Ya” Wu, at the popular Jackson Street Café. They chose the locationto meet with one of its waiters by the name of Wong Jack Man. Their purpose wasto pen a formal letter “accepting” Bruce’s perceived open challenge. While thethree friends had grown up in Chinatown, the twenty-three-year-old Wong wasfresh off the boat from Hong Kong. Clean-cut, tall and thin with a placid mien,Wong looked more like a wispy scholar than a martial artist, but he was askilled practitioner of Northern Shaolin kung fu. His recent demonstrations ofits intricate forms and kicking techniques had impressed the local community.Wong had dreams of quitting his job as a waiter and starting his own kung fuschool. Unlike Bruce Lee, he revered traditional kung fu and wanted to transmitto Chinatown students exactly what his masters had taught him.Once the letter was complete, Wong Jack Man insisted on signing his name at thebottom. David Chin claims he objected: “Wait a minute. I’m supposed to gochallenge the guy.”“Well, I’m going to open a kwoon,” Wong replied. He believed that beating BruceLee would give him sufficient prestige to attract enough students to launch hisown kung fu school.If it was an insult that started the ball rolling, it was ambition that moved itdown the field. Wong Jack Man and Bruce Lee were two young men, both in theirearly twenties, who wanted to make a life for themselves as minorities in ahostile land. One was a traditionalist, the other a rebel—for one to succeed theother had to fail.David Chin drove his beige Pontiac Tempest across the Bay Bridge to Oakland tohand-deliver the challenge letter with Wong Jack Man’s name at the bottom. Whenhe entered the studio and asked to speak to Mr. Lee, Bruce responded, “Yeah,you’re looking for me?” He put down the Chinese wuxia novel he was reading. Itwas The Legend of the Condor Heroes, the tale of two kung fu brothers protectingChina from Genghis Khan and the Mongol invaders. The brothers fall out andbecome rivals.“He was real cocky,” Chin remembers. “He stared at me and then put his feet upon the desk. After I handed him the letter, he looked at it and laughed, andsaid, ‘Okay, that’s no problem. Set the date.’ ”What David didn’t realize was Bruce might have been a brash pretty boy, but hewasn’t a pretender. Other than books, fighting was the only thing that seemed tocalm Bruce Lee down. In the chaos of what he called “the fresh, alive, andconstantly changing nature of combat,” he found a sort of peace. The adrenalinerush forced his hyperactive brain to hyperfocus.No, he wasn’t frightened, more like excited. Nor was he surprised. At the SunSing Theatre, he had jabbed a thumb in the eye of Chinatown’s kung fu community.Bruce Lee was twenty-four years old and he wanted to revolutionize the martialarts.Although he would later claim that he hadn’t intended to issue an openchallenge, he was smart enough to know that’s how the audience might interprethis words. This wasn’t his first challenge match. He knew if you stood on astage in front of an audience of martial artists and claimed your style was thebest someone would volunteer to test the theory.Over the next several weeks, negotiations ensued between Bruce and David Chin,serving as Wong Jack Man’s fight manager, over the time and place. Bruce didn’tcare when it happened but he was insistent on where. If the Chinatown crowdwanted to test him, they would have to come to Oakland and do it on his turf.“The only condition is you have to fight in my school,” Bruce told David. “Iwon’t go out.”As the talks dragged on through September into October, Bruce grew increasinglyfrustrated and annoyed. It was an anxious time in his life. His new Oaklandbranch had only attracted a handful of students, maybe a dozen on a good day.His business partner, James Lee, was despondent and drinking heavily afterburying Katherine on October 5. Bruce’s pregnant wife, Linda, was left to lookafter James’s two grieving children, Greglon and Karena.The outcome of the fight would determine Bruce’s fate. If he lost, his smallcrop of current students would likely drift away and no new ones would sign upto learn from a young master who had just been humiliated. He would be forced toclose his school and go back to his previous job in a Chinese restaurant washingdishes.To prevent either fighter from backing out, David Chin, as the go-between, keptthe hostility level high with provocative taunts. “David was saying one thing toWong Jack Man and another thing to Bruce, until Bruce was fit to be tied andsaid bring him on!” recalls Leo Fong, one of Bruce’s students.By the time the appointed date finally arrived, a weekday in early November,Bruce’s short fuse was already lit. “Few men had a quicker temper,” Linda says.Around 6 p.m., after twilight, Wong Jack Man, David Chin, and four of David’sfriends arrived at Bruce’s kwoon. Inside they found Bruce, Linda, and James.Bruce was pacing in the center of the room.Seeing the Oakland team was outnumbered and unsure if more people would arrive,James walked to the door and bolted it shut, locking everyone inside. He thencrossed to the rear of the studio to stand next to Linda. It was where he kept aconcealed handgun in case the situation spun out of hand. “It was not a friendlyatmosphere,” David remembers. “The challenge was real.”The two combatants had never met before. David Chin stepped up to introducethem, “Bruce Lee, this is—”Bruce waved David away, directing his question at Wong Jack Man, “Were you atthe Sun Sing Theatre?”“No,” Wong Jack Man replied, “but I heard what you said.”David interjected, “This is supposed to be a friendly match, just light sparringto demonstrate who has the superior technique—”“You shut up,” Bruce hissed at David in Cantonese. “You’ve already gotten yourfriend killed.”These threatening words knocked the San Francisco crew back on their heels. Thelevel of hostility was more than they had anticipated. They pulled into a huddleto confer. When they broke, David Chin tried to set some basic ground rules, “Nohitting on the face. No kicking in the groin—”“I’m not standing for any of that!” declared Bruce. “You’ve made thechallenge—so I’m making the rules. So far as I’m concerned, there are no rules.It’s all out.”Watching from the back, Linda smiled to herself. She didn’t speak Cantonese andcouldn’t follow the back-and-forth, but she had faith in her man. “I suppose Ishould have been nervous,” she later recalled. “Yet the truth is that I couldnot have been calmer. I was not in the least concerned for Bruce; I wasabsolutely certain that he could take care of himself.”“Come on,” Bruce said impatiently to Wong Jack Man.As Wong Jack Man stepped forward to face Bruce Lee, the two of them representedthe clash between tradition and modernity. What Bruce Lee mocked Wong Jack Manwanted to preserve. Brash and outspoken, Bruce was dressed in a white tank topand jeans. Introverted and thoughtful, Wong Jack Man was wearing a traditionalblack kung fu uniform with long sleeves and flowing pants. Neither of the twoparticipants, nor the small private audience watching, could have known thatwhat followed would become the most famous challenge match in kung fu history,retold and reinvented countless times in books, plays, and movies.Image [../images/sec.jpg]For a tense moment the two young men just stared at each other. On paper it wasa classic Chinese match: Wong Jack Man’s northern high-kicking style versusBruce Lee’s southern fists of fury. At five-feet-ten and about the same weightas Bruce, Wong Jack Man was longer and leaner and would be expected to use hisreach advantage and superior kicking ability to keep the fight at a distance andpick his opponent apart. Bruce would need to get in close and turn the contestinto a brawl to win.Wong Jack Man bowed his head as Bruce shifted into a Wing Chun stance. Then Wongstepped forward and reached out his right hand. He would later claim he intendedto shake hands (“touch gloves”) in a sportsmanlike manner before the matchbegan. Whatever his intentions, it was a costly mistake. Amped up and coiledtight, Bruce sprung forward with a low kick to the shins and a four-finger spearstraight at Wong Jack Man’s eyes. The attack struck the orbital bone, justnarrowly missing his eyeball. Wong was temporarily stunned and blinded. Bruceimmediately followed with a series of Wing Chun chain punches. His intent was tore-create the eleven-second defeat he had delivered in Seattle to the Japanesekarate guy. “If you get in a fight, you’ve got to take the guy out in the firstten seconds,” says James, explaining Bruce’s philosophy. “You can’t give him achance. Just destroy him.”“That opening move,” recalls Wong, “set the tone for the fight. He really wantedto kill me.”Trying to survive Bruce’s initial onslaught, Wong Jack Man backpedaled and swunghis arms defensively in wide circles. “Wong Jack Man backed off, and Bruce Leekept coming in. He kept coming with rotary punches,” David Chin recalls. “WongJack Man kept backing up and blocking it. The rotary punches coming in, fast.”In the middle of his attack, Bruce switched his stance and snapped a kick atWong’s groin. Wong used his knees to block the kick.It was a chaotic, aggressive, and fast-paced opening frame. Wong Jack Man wasextremely evasive, warding off Bruce’s strikes with his open-handed windmilldefense.But unable to blunt Bruce’s aggression and fearing for his life, Wong Jack Manpanicked—his fight-or-flight instinct kicking in. He turned his back and beganto run, while still swinging his arms in a wide arc to protect the back of hishead from Bruce’s incoming punches. “Wong tried to run away,” Chin says. “Hisback was facing Bruce.”Attached to the main room of the school was a storage room. Trying to escape,Wong Jack Man dashed for the door as Bruce chased, aiming punches at the back ofWong’s head. The two of them sped through the narrow room and out a second doorback into the main room. As Wong came careening out of the storage room withBruce in hot pursuit, he suddenly stopped, whirled around, and windmilled akarate chop to Bruce’s neck. The blow staggered Bruce. It was Wong Jack Man’ssecret weapon.Prior to the fight, Wong had strapped on a pair of leather wrist braceletsstudded with metal spikes. He then carefully hid them from everyone, includinghis own supporters, underneath his long sleeves. “I was surprised,” Chin says.“I didn’t expect it either.” Wong kept them a secret for a very good reason. Inchallenge matches, hidden weapons—razors in shoes, brass knuckles in gloves—arestrictly forbidden. If anyone had known beforehand, Wong would have been forcedto remove the bracelets.When Bruce felt the blood on his neck and realized the deception, he wentberserk. “Bruce was really upset,” Chin recalls. “The pain, I mean from one ofthose wrist braces. Wong wore long sleeves to cover it.” Bruce bellowed andcharged. His frenzied punches pushed Wong Jack Man backward toward a dangerousspot in the main hall. Bruce’s kung fu studio was previously an upholstery storeand there were two showcase windows with raised platforms to display mannequins.On the defensive, Wong Jack Man backpedaled toward the raised platform. Unawareof his surroundings, he tripped on the platform and crashed into the window.Slumped at a 45-degree angle, Wong was trapped, unable to stand up or roll away.Bruce leapt on top of Wong and rained down punches. “Yield!” Bruce demanded.“Give up!”David Chin and the others from San Francisco rushed in and separated the twocombatants, shouting, “That’s enough! That’s enough!” Wong Jack Man hadprearranged with them to intervene if things went badly for him. “Before therewas an understanding we’d break the fight, see,” Chin says.Bruce yelled in Cantonese, “Admit you lost! Say it! Admit you lost!” Wong keptsilent as his friends pulled him dazed and confused from the ground.After Bruce Lee calmed down a bit, he walked over to Wong Jack Man. Just as hehad after the challenge match with the Japanese karate guy, Bruce asked Wong notto discuss the fight. He didn’t want the story getting out. Wong nodded inagreement.The entire fight lasted about three minutes.Chastened, the San Francisco crew shuffled out of the studio with their headsdown. The mood on the ride home was somber. “No one said much,” David Chinrecalls, chuckling.The next day Ben Der, a friend of Bruce’s, went to San Francisco’s Chinatownanxious to learn what had happened. “The day before, everybody was talking aboutit,” he remembers, “saying how exciting it was gonna be. So I purposefully wentdown to Chinatown the next afternoon to see what everyone was saying. And it wasdead quiet. Nobody was saying anything. And that’s how I knew Bruce Lee won thatfight.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]Having been banished from Hong Kong for fighting, Bruce was intimately aware ofhow the aftermath of a fight can cause deeper injuries than the brawl itself. Hevisited the Jackson Street Café a week after the match to smooth things overwith Wong Jack Man. A hostile relationship with all of Chinatown was not inBruce’s best interests.“Hey man, I was just trying to advertise because I got a new school, man,” Brucesaid to Wong as a way of explaining his outburst at the Sun Sing Theatre. “Ididn’t intend to make a public challenge. Look, you and I share a kung fulineage. We are like martial arts cousins. Besides, we are both Chinamen in aCaucasian country. We should be working together, not against each other.There’s no reason for bad feelings. Why are we fighting?”Wong Jack Man, who was sporting a black eye and still smarting from his defeat,just stared at Bruce and refused to respond. Bruce eventually walked away.Bruce had wanted to keep the fight secret, but a challenge match associated,however tangentially, with Hong Kong’s most alluring actress, Diana Chang, wastoo juicy to be ignored. In late November, a gossip column in Hong Kong’s MingPao Daily newspaper ran a highly fictionalized version of the event entitled“Diana Chang Attracts Swarm of Butterflies, Bruce Lee Fights and Suffers LightInjury.” In this imaginative retelling, Wong Jack Man, referred to as an“overseas brother,” was stalking Diana Chang, forcing Bruce Lee to challenge himto defend her honor. In this version, the fight was evenly matched until thefinal round when Bruce was knocked down and defeated.Diana Chang is in San Francisco, and her beauty has charmed and dumbfounded ouryoung overseas brothers. Among them, one has pursued her quite strongly,sticking to her without regard for death, like the shadow follows the form.Diana Chang was pursued by this person until she was at a loss over what todo. . . .Unexpectedly, Bruce Lee, with a look in his eyes and qi in his heart, one nightactually invited this overseas young man to fight. The result of the fight wasthe two were evenly matched, both suffering injury, but Bruce Lee was knockeddown in the last encounter. . . .After this incident the overseas brother realized his victory over Bruce Lee wasonly due to luck, and he ran off to hide somewhere the next day, not daring toagain bother Diana Chang.Since Ming Pao Daily was Hong Kong’s equivalent of The New York Times, the localSan Francisco Chinese-language newspaper, Chinese Pacific Weekly, republishedthe article on November 26, 1964. When Bruce heard about it, he hit the roof.Not only had someone broken their word and spilled the beans about the fight butthe local newspaper was claiming he lost! He approached the Chinese PacificWeekly to tell his side of the story. On December 17, 1964, they published hisresponse.Bruce said the fight had nothing to do with Diana Chang. He blamed David Chin,who had convinced Wong Jack Man that Bruce had issued an open challenge to allof Chinatown when in fact he had only been advertising his new school. Brucemaintained that he won the fight after several punches startled Wong Jack Manand he took off running. Upon wrestling Wong to the ground, Bruce said he raisedhis fist and asked, “Do you yield?” Wong Jack Man twice exclaimed, “I yield, Iyield.”Having been fingered as the instigator, David Chin answered with a letter to theChinese Pacific Weekly on January 7, 1965. He maintained that the cause of thematch was Bruce’s open challenge at the Sun Sing Theatre. Wong Jack Man had onlygone to Oakland for “an exchange of experience” (meaning: light sparring), butBruce, who was very angry and agitated, had the door locked and insisted on “acontest to decide whose skill was high and whose low” (meaning: no rules, fullcontact). Chin claimed neither party won or lost—it was a tie. “They wereseparated by bystanders so as to avoid any injuries or hurt feelings.”Now that this story had blown up into a full-fledged tabloid controversy, it wasinevitable that even the introverted Wong Jack Man would feel he had to respond.He agreed to be interviewed for a January 28, 1965, front-page story completewith a photo of him in a kung fu uniform performing the splits with doublesabers.Wong Jack Man, who lives and works in this city, admitted that he is the“Overseas Chinese Brother” that fought with Bruce Lee at an Oakland martial artsschool. . . . Wong Jack Man admits that he was not there when Bruce Lee was onstage “challenging the Overseas Chinese community,” but says several of hisfriends were eyewitnesses, and all say that Lee did indeed invite the Chinesecommunity to “come when they will to ‘research.’ ”. . . Wong Jack Man says that at about 6:05 Lee stood in the middle of theschool and asked him to step forward. Wong says that, according to the rules ofthe martial arts world, he extended a hand of friendship, but Lee startedattacking. . . . Wong says that neither man ever fell to the ground, but bothparticipants were swayed and both “grazed” their opponent. . . .Wong Jack Man denies that Bruce Lee knocked him back until he was against thewall, or that he was taken down to the ground and forced to plead “mercy.”. . . He says that in the future he will not argue his case again in thenewspaper, and if he is made to fight again, he will instead hold a publicexhibition so that everyone can see with their own eyes.In Wong Jack Man’s mind that last sentence was an open challenge to Bruce: if hedisagreed with Wong’s version of events they could fight again in public. Bruceignored the taunt and refused to reply publicly. (In private, he nicknamed WongJack Man “The Runner.”) He saw little reason for a rematch against a fighter whohad cheated and lost.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Immediately after the fight with Wong Jack Man ended and the San Francisco groupdeparted, Linda expected her husband would be elated. Instead she found himsitting in the back of the school with his head in his hands—dejected andphysically drained. Ever the perfectionist, Bruce Lee was angry about hisperformance, exactly as he had been after he won the boxing match in Hong Kongas a teenager. For Bruce an ugly win was almost as bad as a defeat. “Hisperformance had been neither crisp nor efficient,” Linda recalls. “The fight, herealized, ought to have ended with a few seconds of him striking the firstblows—instead of which, it had dragged on for three minutes. In addition, at theend, Bruce had felt unusually winded which proved to him he was far from perfectcondition. So he began to dissect the fight, analyzing where he had gone wrongand seeking to find ways where he could have improved his performance. It didnot take him long to realize that the basis of his art, the Wing Chun style, wasinsufficient.”Bruce later told one of his friends, “It really bugged me after the fight. Itwas the first time I felt something wrong with the way I was fighting. The fighttook too long and I didn’t know what to do when he ran. Getting my fists bruisedfrom punching the sonavabitch’s head was kinda stupid. I knew right then, I hadto do something about my fighting.”For the past few years he had publicly criticized classical martial arts, while,at the same time, holding up traditional Wing Chun as the answer. But his motherstyle had let him down. Its short, quick techniques were useless against anopponent who stayed out of range and refused to engage. And its trainingmethods—the wooden dummy, sticky hands—were inadequate preparation for a lengthyencounter. Despite a decade of relentless practice, Bruce Lee, whose body wasbasically one fast twitch muscle, lacked the cardiovascular endurance for morethan one three-minute round of combat.The match with Wong Jack Man proved to be an epiphany for Bruce. It was theturning point that led him to abandon his traditional style of kung fu. Foryears, he had preached the individual was more important than the style. Afterhis ugly win, he finally accepted this truth for himself. Modifying a fewtechniques was insufficient. He needed to start from scratch and formulate hisown personal brand of martial arts.Bruce also began to question his career goals. The tabloid controversy andnegative press over his match with Wong Jack Man soured him on the Bay Areamartial arts scene. He had made a number of powerful enemies. Given that his twoschools in Oakland and Seattle were struggling, he wondered if he wanted tospend the rest of his life teaching martial arts."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f0162-01.jpg]Teaching Brandon kung fu in Barrington Plaza apartment, 1966. (Moviestorecollection Ltd / Alamy Stock Photo)"},{"pageContent":"NINEHOLLYWOOD CALLINGPrior to the Internet, Hollywood hair salons were central information hubs forthe movie industry, where well-connected insiders plugged in for updates. JaySebring was the first hairstylist to realize that the same service Hollywood’sleading ladies had long enjoyed could be offered, at a premium, to its powerfulmen. At a time when barbers charged men two dollars for a buzz cut andBrylcreem, Sebring could command $50 for styling with scissors, a blow-dry, andhairspray—plus all the latest industry gossip. Very quickly an hour in hisbarber chair became the most coveted appointment in Hollywood. His celebrityclients included Warren Beatty, Steve McQueen, Paul Newman, Frank Sinatra, andKirk Douglas. He even designed the Doors’ Jim Morrison’s free-flowing locks.One afternoon in early 1965, Sebring was styling the hair of William Dozier, adapper, Madison Avenue–type TV producer. Dozier was developing a Charlie Chanspinoff series entitled Charlie Chan’s Number One Son. The pitch: after themurder of Charlie Chan, the fictional Honolulu detective, his eldest son mustavenge his death and continue his legacy. Dozier wanted it to be an actionthriller—a “Chinese James Bond.” His radical idea was to cast an actual Chineseactor for a Chinese role. Back then in the yellow-face era, white actorsinvariably played Asian parts with taped eyes and painted faces. In sixteenfilms, Charlie Chan was portrayed by Warner Oland, a Swedish actor. As a result,there was only a tiny pool of Asian actors with any serious experience—mostlythey played villains in World War II dramas and pigtailed coolies in Westerns.“I need to find an Oriental actor who speaks English and can handle action,”Dozier complained to Sebring. “Someone with leading man charisma.”Sebring, who was one of Ed Parker’s karate students and had attended his 1964Long Beach International Karate Championships several months earlier, respondedimmediately, “I have your guy.”“Who is he?”“Bruce Lee.”“Never heard of him.”“There’s film of him at Long Beach,” Sebring said. “He will blow you away.”“Can I see it?” Dozier excitedly asked.On January 21, 1965, Jay Sebring and Ed Parker drove the film over for ascreening at Dozier’s offices in 20th Century Fox. As soon as he saw it, Dozierknew he’d found his man. He immediately phoned James Lee’s home in Oakland.And just like that Bruce Lee was discovered by Hollywood.“Bruce was out when the call came through and I spoke to Dozier,” Linda recalls.“Although I had never heard of him and he didn’t tell me what he wanted, itsounded very hopeful. When Bruce returned his call, Dozier explained that he wasinterested in him for his new TV series. Understandably, we were both veryexcited.”It was an extraordinary opportunity. Previously, the only Asian to ever star inan American TV series was the Chinese American actress Anna May Wong, in TheGallery of Madame Liu-Tsong (1951). No Asian male actor had ever played theprotagonist on a network TV show. There were so few roles for Asians inHollywood that Bruce Lee, who was a veteran of twenty Hong Kong movies, nevereven considered acting in America. “When I went back to the States, I reallydidn’t think, I mean, I said, ‘Here I am with a Chinese face.’ I mean notprejudice or anything but being realistic thinking, ‘How many times in film is aChinese required?’ ” Bruce explained in an Esquire interview. “And when it isrequired, it is always branded as the typical, you know, ‘Dung ta la la ta dungdung dung,’ that type you know what I mean. I said, ‘To hell with it.’ ”If Bruce landed the part, he would achieve something historic. He would be theJackie Robinson of Asian actors. He would also, perhaps more importantly to him,finally step out of his father’s shadow and surpass his old man. “I felt that Ihad to accomplish something personally,” he told a reporter from TV and MovieScreen magazine. “What would I have done if I’d gone back to Hong Kong? Nothing.I could have said, ‘Bring tea,’ and the servant would have brought tea. Justlike that. I could have spent every day in leisure. I wanted to do something formyself—to bring honor to my own name. In Hong Kong, if I rode in a big car,people only said, ‘There’s Bruce Lee in his old man’s car.’ Whatever I did, itwas a reflection of what my family had already accomplished.”Bruce was so thrilled he immediately agreed to fly down to L.A. for a screentest, despite the fact his wife was nine months pregnant.Image [../images/sec.jpg]On February 1, 1965, the first day of the Chinese New Year, Linda gave birth atEast Oakland Hospital. It was a baby boy, just as Bruce had predicted. Hisparents gave him the English name Brandon Bruce Lee and the Chinese name Gok Ho,which means “National Hero.” “Bruce was intensely proud to have a son,” saysLinda, “the first grandchild of his family.” Brandon arrived in this world at ahealthy eight pounds and eleven ounces with jet black hair, which quickly fellout and grew in platinum blond. “Our first child is a blond, grey-eyedChinaman,” Bruce proudly told everyone, “maybe the only one around.” Like hisfather, Brandon quickly became a handful for his inexperienced mother. “Brandondid not sleep through the night for eighteen months. He never took to a pacifieror a special blanket, he just hollered all the time,” Linda recalls, “whichironically, seems to have marked the beginning of his life’s pattern.”It is an indication of how much Bruce wanted to seize his Hollywood opportunitythat he did not reschedule his screen test. Three days after the delivery, Bruceleft his newlywed wife and newborn son and hopped on a plane. “Bruce was a superdad, but he was not the kind who changed diapers or got up in the middle of thenight,” Linda explains. “He had weightier things on his mind, like building acareer and paying the bills.”Jay Sebring picked up the exhausted new father from the L.A. airport. It was thefirst time the two men had met. They immediately bonded over Jay’s muscle car, aShelby Cobra. Along with fast cars and Asian martial arts, Jay and Bruce shareda love for fashionable clothes, stylish haircuts, and beautiful women. Sebring—ajet-setting playboy who was dating the actress Sharon Tate—was a gatekeeper forHollywood’s Cult of Cool. (Steve McQueen was the King.) The screen test at 20thCentury Fox was Bruce’s first step in his initiation.Bruce met with William Dozier at his office for a pre-interview to cover thetopics that would be discussed and the demonstrations to be performed. AfterwardDozier and the film crew took Bruce to a studio stage set dressed like anaffluent suburban living room and sat him down in a folding chair in front of anelegant camelback sofa. Wearing a tight black suit, white shirt, and black tiewith a small knot, Bruce looked like an earnest Bible salesman or a youngcongressional aide at a funeral. His hair was neatly parted on the left andbrushed back to reveal his entire forehead and dramatic black eyebrows. Brucecrossed his legs and clasped his hands in his lap. He was visibly nervous.As the film began to roll, Dozier, standing off-camera, gave his firstinstruction: “Now Bruce, look into the camera lens and tell us your name, age,and where you were born.”“My last name is Lee—Bruce Lee. I was born in San Francisco. I am twenty-fourright now.”“And you worked in motion pictures in Hong Kong?”“Yes, since I was around six years old,” Bruce answered, shifting his eyes, hisanxiety palpable.Trying to lighten the mood, Dozier said, “I understand you just had a baby boy.And you’ve lost a little sleep over it, have you?”Bruce chuckled ruefully, “Yeah, three nights.”“And tell the crew,” Dozier continued in a light tone, “what time they shoot thepictures in Hong Kong.”“Well, mostly in the morning, because it’s kind of noisy in Hong Kong you know,around three million people there. So every time when you have a picture it’smostly say 12 a.m. to 5 a.m. in the morning.”“They’d love that here,” Dozier joked. “And you went to college in the UnitedStates?“Yes.”“What did you study?”“Ah,” Bruce paused, his eyes looking up and to the right, “Ph-philosophy.”“And you told me earlier today that karate or jujitsu are not the most powerfulor best forms of Oriental fighting. What is the most powerful or best form?”“Well, it’s bad to say the best, but, ah,” Bruce smiled to himself, “in myopinion, I think gung fu is pretty good.”“Tell us a little bit about gung fu.”“Well, gung fu is originated in China. It is the ancestor of karate and jujitsu.It is a more complete system. And it is more fluid—by that I mean, it is moreflowing. There is continuity in movement instead of one movement, two movement,and then stop.”“Would you explain the principles of a glass of water as it applies to gung fu?”Dozier asked, bringing up a topic from the pre-interview.“Well, gung fu, the best example would be a glass of water,” Bruce smiled,finally feeling comfortable. “Why? Because water is the softest substance in theworld but yet it can penetrate the hardest rock or anything, granite, you nameit. Um, water also is insubstantial—by that I mean you cannot grasp hold of it;you cannot punch it and hurt it. So every gung fu man is trying to do that: tobe soft like water and flexible and adapt itself to the opponent.”“I see, what’s the difference between a gung fu punch and a karate punch?”“Well, the karate punch is like an iron bar—wham. A gung fu punch is like aniron chain with an iron ball attached to the end,” Bruce chuckled, licking hislips. “And it go—WHANG!—and it hurts inside.”“Okay, now we are going to cut,” Dozier instructed, “and in just a second wewill have you stand up and show us some gung fu and some movements.”“Okay,” Bruce nodded.After a fresh reel of film was loaded, Dozier asked Bruce to act out someclassic character types from Chinese Opera. Drawing from his experience watchinghis father onstage, Bruce successfully imitated how a warrior and scholar walk.“The scholar is a weakling, a ninety pound in Charles Atlas,” Bruce chuckled,mincing in front of the camera. “He would be walking just like a girl, shouldersup and everything.”“So by the way they walk, you can immediately tell who they are,” Dozier said.“Right, the character they represent.”“Now, show some gung fu movements.”“Well, it’s hard to show it alone,” Bruce shrugged, dramatically, “but I willtry to do my best.”“Well, maybe one of the fellas will walk in,” Dozier said, playing his part inthe setup. “You guys want to—”The crew started laughing and calling out, “Go ahead, come on, get in there,” asthey pushed the assistant director, a balding man in his late fifties withsilver hair and black horn-rim glasses, in front of the camera. He clearly wasnot expecting to be the butt of the joke.“Accidents do happen!” Bruce teased.“There are various kinds of fighting,” Bruce explained to the camera. “Itdepends on where you hit and what weapon you will be using. To the eyes, youwould use fingers.” Bruce lashed out a finger strike millimeters from the man’seyes and pulled it back before the assistant director could react. “Don’t worry,I won’t—” Bruce assured him, and then lashed another strike at his eyes. “Orstraight at the face,” added Bruce as he punched at his nose. The assistantdirector flinched.“Hold it just a minute,” Dozier said as he stepped in front of the camera andgrabbed the assistant director’s arm. “Let’s move the gentleman around this wayso you are doing it more into the camera. Okay, swell.”As they adjusted positions, Bruce said, “And then there is bent arm strike usingthe waist again into a backfist.” Immediately he flicked out three punches sofast they made the assistant director’s neck jerk back and forth like abobblehead doll.“Let’s have the assistant director back up just a little bit,” Dozier teased.Subdued chuckles from the crew turned into belly laughs and Bruce tried to coverhis smile with his hand. Finally comfortable and feeling in control of the room,Bruce joked, “You know, kung fu is very sneaky. You know the Chinese, theyalways hit low.” Bruce feinted to the old man’s face, dropped low, and lashed apunch at his groin. The assistant director’s entire body was swaying back andforth in reaction to blows too fast for his brain to register. “Don’t worry,”Bruce said, patting him on the arm.“These are just natural reactions,” the assistant director pleaded.“Right, right,” smiled Bruce.“Cheat into the camera and show us again,” Dozier instructed.“There is the finger jab, there’s the punch, there is the backfist—then low,” heexclaimed as he linked all four strikes into a flurry that caused the assistantdirector to spasm with fear. “Then there are the kicks—straight to the groin,then up!” And just as fast as the punches, Bruce flicked a snap kick to thegroin, and brought up a roundhouse kick to his head. “Or if I can back up,”Bruce said before stepping back and snapping out a sidekick within inches of theassistant director’s face.The crew behind the camera laughed openly in appreciation and awe of Bruce Lee’sspeed, accuracy, and control. He had shown them something they had never seenbefore.Patting the assistant director on the arm, Bruce smiled. “He’s kind of worried.”“He has nothing to worry about,” Dozier declared.And with that Bruce’s nerves were gone. Five years of working the stage in frontof live audiences up and down the West Coast had finally paid off.The next day, Bruce flew back to his wife and newborn son.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Three days later, seven after the birth of Brandon, Bruce Lee received a callinforming him that his father was dead. The timing was not viewed as acoincidence by the family. Hoi Chuen had been sick for a long time, sufferingfrom a terrible cough. Doctors told him the years of smoking opium had weakenedhis heart and lungs. When he learned there was a grandson to continue the familylineage, the patriarch of the clan was finally able to let go.Linda was having difficulty recovering from the delivery. It had left her in aweakened state. Bruce was torn between his concern for his wife’s health and hisConfucian duty to attend his father’s funeral. It was eventually decided thatBrandon and Linda would move in with her mother in Seattle, while Bruce was inHong Kong for three weeks from February 15 to March 6.According to Chinese custom if a son is not present when his father dies, hemust come crawling back to ask forgiveness. At the doorway of the mortuary,Bruce dropped to his knees and crawled on all fours to his father’s casket,while wailing uncontrollably as tradition demanded. Bruce described the serviceas a “cross between Chinese custom and Catholic regulation; the whole deal wasone mess of conflict.” Because of Chinese tradition, Bruce couldn’t cut his hairor shave: “All in all, I look like a pirate with long hair and whiskers.”Bruce’s first letter to Linda was filled with worry about her well being: “Onething I’m anxious [about] is your health. I hope you will go have a check up.Never mind about the expense, your health is more important. . . . Do not forgetto go to the doctor and above all do not forget to let me know of the result(like your blood count, etc.). If there is anything that has to be done, do it!Do not worry about expenses. I’ll be able to pay for it.”As the eldest son, Peter helped Grace deal with the will and Hoi Chuen’s estate.Bruce quickly set about spending his inheritance on gifts for himself (threetailored suits plus a top coat), Linda’s mother (a purse and jade jewelry), andLinda (a wig and, most importantly, a diamond wedding ring to replace the one hehad borrowed from James’s wife, Katherine). “Let’s hope I’ll bring everythingthrough without the customs official finding out. I can’t afford to pay tax onthem all,” Bruce wrote to Linda. “In fact, I’m broke starting tomorrow. You’llknow why when you see me: wig, ring, etc., etc., etc.”Bruce returned to America in mid-March. Peter chose to stay in Hong Kong, teachschool, and look after the family.Soon after coming home, Bruce received a call from William Dozier. Everyone hadloved the screen test. Plans for Number One Son were under way, but it mighttake another two or three months until there was noticeable progress. In themeantime Dozier wanted to sign Bruce to an exclusive contract for $1,800 (theequivalent of $14,000 in 2017). How did that sound? Bruce, who was making ahundred or so per month teaching kung fu, didn’t need to be asked twice. It wasthe biggest payday of his life.With all this money burning a hole in his pocket, Bruce decided to take his wifeand child for an extended vacation in Hong Kong to meet his family. Brucepitched it to Linda as the honeymoon they hadn’t previously been able to afford:“Baby, this trip you’ll remember the rest of your life. I can promise you that.We’ll buy the whole of Hong Kong.”  They planned to leave in early May whenBrandon was old enough to travel.Bruce and James agreed to shut down their Oakland school. After six months inbusiness, there still were not enough students to cover the rent. At least forthe moment, Bruce abandoned his plans for a national chain of kung fu schoolsand decided to return to the family business of acting. “Just about the time Idiscovered I didn’t want to teach self defense for the rest of my life,” Bruceexplained, “I went to the Long Beach International Karate Tournament and gotmyself discovered by Hollywood.”Prior to the Lee family’s departure, Bruce underwent a ritual familiar to newactors in Hollywood—finding an agent. On April 22, William Dozier wrote to Brucewith a recommendation: “I am taking the liberty of suggesting a reputable andhonest agent for you, one William Belasco, President of Progressive ManagementAgency here in Hollywood.” Along with the letter, Dozier included thepresentation material for Number One Son. A few days later Bruce met withWilliam Belasco and signed with him—his first (and last) Hollywood agent. Duringtheir conversation, Belasco informed Bruce that Number One Son was on hold untilJuly. Bruce agreed to return from Hong Kong when the project restarted.“After reading the ‘presentation’ I’m very enthused on the whole project andhave added several ideas of my own to add more ‘coolness’ and ‘subtleness’ tothe character of Charlie Chan’s son,” Bruce wrote back to Dozier on April 28.“This project does have tremendous potential and its uniqueness lies in theinterfusion of the best of both the Oriental and American qualities plus thenever before seen Gung Fu fighting techniques. . . . I have a feeling that thisCharlie Chan can be another James Bond success if handled properly.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]Concerned his family might not fully embrace his white wife, who spoke noChinese, and towheaded baby boy, Bruce called his mother and told her she couldexpect to see “the only blond-haired, gray-eyed Chinaman in the world.” He alsotouted Linda’s many wonderful qualities, specifically her abilities as a cook.They arrived on May 7 to a family still grieving. Bruce’s mother was deeplydepressed. The family was polite to Linda but distant, accepting her in astandoffish way. “It wasn’t palsy-walsy,” Linda recalls. “They would havepreferred that Bruce had married a Chinese girl.” All of his family’s love andattention focused on little Brandon as if Linda was simply the wet nurse.To add to Linda’s discomfort, the Nathan Road apartment, while spacious by HongKong standards, felt tiny and overcrowded to her. There was little privacy andno way to escape the oppressive Hong Kong summer heat (80–85°F) and humidity(85–90 percent). The change in weather caused Brandon to fall ill. But even whenhe recovered, he was difficult. “Brandon was an awful baby,” Linda says. “Hecried all the time. Not sick, just ornery.”As the first grandchild in the family, Brandon was treated like a littleemperor. Any sign of the slightest disturbance would cause all of the Chinesewomen to intervene. No matter what time of night, Bruce’s mother, sister, oraunt would jump out of bed at the first whimper to soothe him. “Since we livedin such close quarters,” says Linda, “Brandon couldn’t be allowed to cry, oreven utter a peep, without being rescued by a well-meaning grandma or auntie.” Their overprotectiveness felt like an implicit rebuke of Linda’s abilities as amother. To maintain her position, Linda would preemptively walk the floors withbabe in arms into the wee hours of the morning. The insufferable heat, thecramped living conditions, the awkward family dynamics, the language barrier,the sleep deprivation—it was all wearing Linda down. Worse, Brandon was becoming“the number-one spoiled child you have ever come across.”To prove to his relatives that his American wife wasn’t useless, Bruce braggedabout her cooking. “She can cook anything. Just you ask. You ought to try herspaghetti sauce. Just ask. It is the greatest spaghetti on the face of theearth.” He went on and on until everybody was after Linda to make herworld-famous spaghetti dinner. She tried to play them off but finally succumbedto the pressure.The problem was she didn’t actually know how to make spaghetti sauce. Her secretingredient was Lawry’s Original Style Spaghetti Sauce Spice & Seasonings mix,unheard of in Hong Kong. The colony didn’t have any Western-style supermarkets.She had also never cooked for more than five people. Bruce invited twenty of hisclosest relatives and friends for this alleged feast. As the evening approacheda feeling of dread came over Linda. While she did find enough tomatoes and asemblance of spices, she had never cooked with a gas stove before and quicklydiscovered how easily tomatoes burn. “It was awful,” she recalls, “just anunmitigated disaster. The spaghetti was permeated with the taste of burnedtomatoes. His family ate and smiled and made little murmuring sounds, but Icould tell that they were sorry that Bruce was ‘stuck’ with me.”It was not the honeymoon Bruce had promised, but he was right about one thing:it was a trip that Linda would remember for the rest of her life.While Linda looked after Brandon, Bruce sought to improve his martial arts andfurther his credibility as a kung fu instructor. He asked his master, Ip Man, tohelp him with his next book project: a Wing Chun instructional manual. Brucehired the Mount Tai Photography House to take two hundred photos of Ip Mandemonstrating Wing Chun techniques over the course of a week. “Ip Man didn’tlike to be photographed, but Bruce’s request was the exception,” says RobertChan. “Bruce was one of Ip Man’s favorite students because of his dedication tothe martial arts.”While in Hong Kong, Bruce continued to obsess over his ugly match against WongJack Man. “The more I think of him to have fought me without getting blastedbad, the more I’m pissed off!” Bruce wrote to James Lee. “If I just took mytime, but anger screwed me up—that bum is nothing!”  The more he stewed the morecertain he became that Wing Chun had failed him. “My mind is made up to start asystem of my own,” he wrote to Taky Kimura, “I mean a system of totality,embracing all but yet guided with simplicity.” Over the course of the summer, hemailed to James detailed descriptions complete with stick-figure drawings of hisnew style, which he summarized as “a combination of chiefly Wing Chun, fencing,and boxing.”When he wasn’t developing his new style with its focus on simplicity, he wasseeking out traditional kung fu instructors to teach him complex techniques forhis Hollywood career. “On this trip I’ll pick up some flowery [kung fu] formsand what not for the TV show,” Bruce wrote to Taky. “The viewers like fancystuff anyway.” In his practice of the martial arts, he was developing adistinction between what was effective for him as a fighter (the martial) andwhat looked good as an entertainer (the arts). Low kicks, for example, were forfighting, while high kicks were for film.As July approached, Bruce expected to be called back to California to beginshooting Number One Son, but he was beginning to learn that Hollywood is a townwhere many promises are made but few are kept. His agent, Belasco, notified himthat Number One Son was on hold until Dozier completed a different TV project.“Well, I guess I wouldn’t be in Life magazine yet,” Bruce joked with TakyKimura, “because they want to concentrate first on ‘Batman.’ ”In the meantime, Belasco sought to keep his new client happy by finding otherroles for him. A golden opportunity had arisen with The Sand Pebbles—a movieabout American sailors, along with a crew of Chinese coolies, patrolling theYangtze River in 1920s China. There was a prominent part for a Chinesecrewmember named Po-Han, who is drawn into a boxing match against a bullyingAmerican sailor. Belasco told Bruce the director, Robert Wise, was veryinterested, but Wise decided to give the part to the veteran Japanese Americanactor Mako Iwamatsu. It was a terrible blow since the role was perfect for Bruceand the movie starred his future student and friend Steve McQueen. If Bruce hadlanded the part, he would have enjoyed a much different career path. The SandPebbles went on to earn eight Oscar nominations, including Best Supporting Actorfor Mako.Disappointed with the delay in his starring TV project and the loss of a greatmovie role, Bruce decided to reach out to his childhood friends who were stillin the Hong Kong film business. Not only did he want to brag about CharlieChan’s Number One Son, he also hoped to land a movie deal by leveragingHollywood against Hong Kong—a technique he would use to great effect severalyears later. His pitch to producers was simple: I’m about to become the mostfamous Chinese actor in America; sign me now while you can still afford me. Itseems his approach achieved some success. Several executives expressed genuineinterest. Nothing was definite, but, as Bruce and his family boarded a plane atKai Tak Airport for America, he believed that a movie career in Hong Kong was aviable backup option.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Bruce, Linda, and Brandon landed in Seattle in early September 1965 and moved inwith Linda’s mother, stepfather, and grandmother. It was unclear how long theyplanned to stay. Bruce was anxiously waiting for the green light on Number OneSon. The word from Dozier was always good—“soon, real soon”—but there werecontinually further delays as Dozier developed Batman instead.As the weeks dragged into months, the living arrangements grew increasinglyuncomfortable. “Brandon was screaming all the time,” Linda says. “He was spoiledrotten by this time. He would cry and it would bother my grandmother and I wouldget up at all hours once again to walk him so he wouldn’t disturb her.”With all this free time, Bruce taught the occasional class in Seattle and made acouple of trips to Oakland, but mostly he focused on his training and developinghis new style. “There was much self-analysis,” Linda says. “He becameself-critical again because he felt that that would help him move forwardagain.” He read through his library of books, mostly boxing and fencing but alsophilosophy, looking for inspiration. He watched 16mm films of boxers like JackDempsey and Cassius Clay, who had recently changed his name to Muhammad Ali.Bruce loved Ali’s swagger and was obsessed with his “phantom punch” knockout ofSonny Liston on May 25, 1965. “If it wasn’t a fix,” Bruce wrote to Taky Kimura,“Liston must have timed his rushing in with the on-coming force of Clay’s punchso well that Liston was knocked out cold.”During their stay, Linda claims that her mother “really got to know and loveBruce.” While Mrs. Emery may have found him charming, she worried about his lackof steady employment. Every day she came home from her job at Sears to find herson-in-law reading, watching films, or working out.“When is your husband going to get a real job?” she would pointedly wonderaloud.“I have this movie job coming up,” Bruce would insist, referencing both theCharlie Chan TV show and all the Hong Kong film producers who were supposedlyeager to sign him.“Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,” Mrs. Emery would dismissively respond.After living for four months with his mother-in-law, it was plainly time tomove. Bruce decided to temporarily relocate to James Lee’s home in Oakland. Hisfinancial situation had grown precarious. Between the gifts and the vacation, hehad burned through the Hollywood signing money, and the prospects for Number OneSon looked dubious. “It may be this Charlie Chan project which will developfully for you, or another project,” Dozier attempted to comfort Bruce, “but restassured we shall try to come up with the best possible opportunity for you.”Dozier was waiting to see the public’s reaction to Batman, which was scheduledto premiere on ABC as a midseason replacement on January 12, 1966. If it was asuccess, the network would almost certainly green-light his next project.Bruce wrote to one of his Bay Area students on December 18, 1965: “Linda and Iwill be coming down to Oakland to stay for a month before either going toHollywood or Hong Kong. The 20th Century Fox deal is 85%. If that doesn’t comeout I have two contracts waiting in Hong Kong.”Bruce Lee’s future was at a crossroads, and it all depended on Gotham City’sCaped Crusader."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f0178-01.jpg]Bruce Lee in Kato costume visiting Thordis Brandt on the movie set of In LikeFlint. She was playing “Amazon #6,” circa August 1966. (David Tadman)"},{"pageContent":"TENCITIZEN KATOTo everyone’s surprise (including Dozier’s and ABC’s), Batman became aphenomenon. With its campy sensibility, pun-saturated dialogue, Andy Warholpop-art primary-colored costumes, hammy bad guys, and colorful fight captions(“Biff!” “Zlonk!” “Kapow!”) that blasted across the screen, Batman appealed tocomic-book fanboys, urban aesthetes, and stoned college kids. Dozier describedit as the only situational comedy on-air without a laugh track. In early March1966, Batman landed on the cover of Life magazine with the headline: “The WholeCountry Goes Supermad.”In a town where unlikely success breeds immediate imitation, ABC’s executiveshounded Dozier for a follow-up series. By the end of February 1966, Doziersubmitted a first draft script for Charlie Chan’s Number One Son. A few weekslater, ABC rejected the project. It is unknown exactly why, although not hard toguess. No TV executive in 1966 was willing to risk his job by green-lighting ashow starring a completely unknown Chinese actor.While network TV’s all-white facade was beginning to crack (the previous year ISpy became the first show to costar a black actor, Bill Cosby), the plight forAsian actors in Hollywood had been dire for a long time. The first and lastAsian male matinee idol was Sessue Hayakawa in the silent era of the 1910–20s.Before sound and in black-and-white, American and European audiences,particularly white women, found his Japanese features to be exotic andtitillating. He became an overnight superstar on par with Charlie Chaplin andDouglas Fairbanks Sr. with The Cheat (1915). It was a Fifty Shades of Grey–typemovie about a venal stockbroker’s wife (Fannie Ward) who falls into debt andborrows money from a Japanese antique dealer (Hayakawa) in return for hervirtue. When she tries to pay him back the cash, he refuses and brands her onthe shoulder as his property. “The effect of Hayakawa on American women was evenmore electric than Valentino’s,” reported film critic DeWitt Bodeen. “Itinvolved fiercer tones of masochism.” An American journalist quoted Hayakawa assaying, “My crientele [sic] is women. They rike [sic] me to be strong andviolent.”They also liked him to be silent. The advent of talking pictures in 1927 exposedHayakawa’s thick Japanese accent, which suburban housewives found significantlyless stimulating than his cheekbones, and sent his career as a romantic idolinto decline until Pearl Harbor finished it off. After World War II, the onlyroles Hayakawa could secure were honorable villains like Colonel Saito in TheBridge on the River Kwai (1957).What happened to Hayakawa reflected a broader trend in postwar American culture:Asian male characters were desexualized. As a result, Asian actors weredisqualified from playing romantic leads. Number One Son represented a uniquechance for an Asian actor to play a heroic leading man on network TV. Itsrejection by ABC was a lost opportunity to undermine the emasculated stereotypeand a blow to Bruce Lee’s hopes of overnight stardom.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Like any good producer, William Dozier hedged his bets. He had multiple projectsat various stages of development to present to TV executives. His strategy wasto buy up the TV rights to various comic book, radio, and literary properties,including Charlie Chan, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Dick Tracy. For the past year,he had worked to secure The Green Hornet, a popular 1930s radio serial.Created by George W. Trendle, the show’s premise was simple: Britt Reid was amillionaire muckraking newspaper publisher by day and a masked crime-fighter,the Green Hornet, by night. Reid’s sidekick was his faithful Japanese valet,Kato. (The radio producers changed Kato’s nationality to Filipino after Japaninvaded China in 1937.) Trendle conceived of the show as a modern-day sequel tohis most popular invention, The Lone Ranger. Britt Reid was the great-nephew ofthe Lone Ranger, Kato was the minority stand-in for Tonto, and Reid’stricked-out car, the Black Beauty, was an update to “the great horse Silver.”In the summer of 1965, Dozier and Trendle entered into discussions about TVrights to The Green Hornet. “I have a superb Oriental in the bullpen for Kato,”Dozier bragged to Trendle in a letter dated November 16, 1965. “He is actuallyan American-born Chinese but can play any sort of Oriental or Filipino. I don’tthink we should ever say what sort of nationality Kato is: just let him be whathe looks like—an Oriental. The actor I have in mind for the role is a Black BeltKarate, incidentally, and can perform every trick in the Karate book.”In March 1966, the same month Number One Son was rejected, 20th Century Foxannounced The Green Hornet was coming to television in the fall. This turn ofevents left Dozier to make an awkward call to Oakland. Instead of starring inhis own TV series as a Chinese James Bond–type hero, how would Bruce like toplay the Oriental manservant to a rich white crime-fighter? The answer was hewouldn’t. “It sounded at first like typical houseboy stuff,” Bruce explained toThe Washington Post. “I tell Dozier, ‘Look if you sign me up with all thatpigtail and hopping around jazz, forget it.’ ”The truth was Bruce didn’t really have a choice. He was under contract toDozier. Even if he could legally pass on the role, he had a young wife, aninfant child, and an empty bank account. But despite having no leverage, Bruceinsisted he would only take the part if it was upgraded and modernized from theradio version where Kato’s biggest moments came when Britt Reid, the publisher,barked, “My car, Kato,” and Kato answered, “Yessuh, Mistah Blitt.” Like any goodproducer, Dozier reassured his actor. Kato wouldn’t be a servant but a partner.In fact, Kato would be the Green Hornet’s most important weapon and handlealmost all of the fight scenes. It would also be the first chance for Americanaudiences to see Chinese kung fu on national TV.Dozier had Bruce at “kung fu.” While Kato was a disappointment compared toCharlie Chan’s son, it was still a unique opportunity for an unknown actor toshowcase his talents and beloved native art form. And unlike most producers,Dozier meant what he promised. However, he left out one important detail—hewasn’t completely in charge of the show. In order to secure the TV rights, hehad been forced to give George Trendle final script approval.Image [../images/sec.jpg]For the past year, Bruce, Linda, and Brandon had stayed with either family orfriends in Hong Kong, Seattle, and Oakland. In mid-March, they moved into a tinyold-fashioned apartment on the corner of Wilshire Boulevard and Gayley Avenue inthe Westwood neighborhood of Los Angeles. It was the first time the young couplehad lived alone since their marriage.As soon as Bruce arrived in L.A., Dozier enrolled him in acting classes withJeff Corey, a character actor who had been blacklisted in the 1950s. Brucedescribed him to friends as “the best drama coach here in Hollywood.” Corey’scelebrity client list included James Dean, Kirk Douglas, Jane Fonda, JackNicholson, Leonard Nimoy, Barbra Streisand, and Robin Williams. These lessonswere the only formal acting training Bruce ever had. Corey taught Bruce aboutcamera shots, lighting, placement, matching, and other factors involved intelevision production, but his primary objective was to improve Bruce’s dictionand reduce his Hong Kong accent. “People just couldn’t understand him,” says VanWilliams, who was cast as Britt Reid/The Green Hornet. “He had that thick accentand he’d try to slow it down or speed it up and it was still bad.” Severalmonths of intensive instruction paid off. Bruce later joked with journalists:“You know how I got that job playing Kato? The hero’s name was Britt Reid, and Iwas the only Chinese guy in all of California who could pronounce Britt Reid,that’s why!”Production for The Green Hornet began in June. Bruce was paid $400 a week ($313take-home pay), and the first check arrived just in the nick of time. “We didn’thave enough to pay the rent and other outstanding bills,” says Linda. For amarried couple that was used to living on $100 to $200 a month, it felt likethey had won the lottery. “We thought it was all the money in the world,” Lindarecalls.And they acted like it. Bruce immediately went out and purchased a brand-newblue 1966 Chevy Nova for $2,500. He then moved his family into a spectaculartwo-bedroom apartment on the twenty-third floor of Barrington Plaza. It was morethan Bruce could afford, but he had received a tip from Burt Ward, who playedRobin on Batman and also lived in the building—the manager was willing to cutunder-the-table deals for Hollywood actors and other special tenants. In returnfor martial arts lessons, the manager halved Bruce’s rent. This arrangementlasted for three months—Bruce taught kung fu to the manager and Burt Ward—untilthe owners discovered the deception and everyone was evicted. Bruce, Linda, andBrandon briefly moved to a rental house in Inglewood before switching to anotherrental in Culver City on August 30, 1967. In nine years of marriage this nomadicfamily moved eleven times.Bruce may have felt rich, but he was actually getting screwed. He had made aclassic rookie actor mistake—he signed with the agent recommended by his boss.It turned out his agent, Belasco, was good friends with Dozier, and thus strucka deal more to Dozier’s benefit than Bruce’s. The weekly salaries for the fivepermanent players were: Bruce Lee (Kato) $400; Walter Brooke (District AttorneyScanlon) $750; Wende Wagner (Miss Case) $850; Lloyd Gough (Mike Axford) $1,000;Van Williams (Britt Reid/The Green Hornet) $2,000. Despite being the second leadof the show, the Chinese guy was paid far less than the white actors.Fortunately for Belasco’s physical safety, Bruce never discovered that he wasmaking five times less than Van Williams. Dozier, perhaps feeling guilty, bumpedup Bruce’s salary to $550 per week on November 30, 1966.Image [../images/sec.jpg]At the end of May, Bruce and Van Williams met for the first time at a pressparty to promote the Green Hornet program. The introduction took place at aceremonial luncheon attended by scores of television and motion pictureexecutives and some sixty members of the press. The scene was the ballroom ofthe posh Beverly Hills Hotel, whose proprietors had tinted all the drinks asickly green in honor of their guests.Dozier opened with a lame Batman joke: “What happens if Batman and Robin are runover by a steam roller? They come out Flatman and Ribbon.”  The crowd politelyguffawed. Dozier told the press he intended to cash in on the Batman fad bymaking a motion picture about the Caped Crusader, and hoped to do one about theGreen Hornet too. “What we are after with The Green Hornet,” Dozier explained,“is The Ipcress File [a 1965 British espionage film starring Michael Caine] sortof technique—pace, flair, lots of gadgets and gimmickry. The Green Hornet’s car,Black Beauty, will be so filled with wild gimmicks it will make James Bond’s carlook like a baby buggy.”Dozier then called up Adam West, the star of Batman, to the microphone. Afterjoking about the media coverage of Batman, West introduced Van Williams andBruce Lee. Van Williams—a tall, handsome, thirty-two-year-old Texan, who hadcostarred in the TV series Surfside 6 (1962)—expressed surprise to be there. Hehad only signed on to the show two days prior. Bruce was so happy he looked likea kid on Christmas morning. He thanked the gathering in Cantonese.During the question-and-answer session, one of the reporters asked Van Williams,“Do you really believe playing the Green Hornet will advance your actingaspirations?”“The success of Batman made a lot of people sit up and take notice,” VanWilliams replied. “You know, there are a lot of fine Shakespearean actors whoare starving.”Another reporter asked Bruce, “In the early days of radio, Kato was identifiedas a Japanese but during the war he suddenly shifted nationalities and emergedas Filipino. How do you see Kato?”“Speaking for myself, I am Chinese,” Bruce replied emphatically.“But won’t some knowing Orientals protest, since Kato is after all, a Japanesename?” the reporter followed up.“I am a karate expert, black belt class,” Bruce explained gravely. “Anyoneobject, I put them on their back.”Dozier jumped to his feet to intervene: “It is not really important whether Katois Japanese or Chinese since the show is not exactly striving for reality.”Once the formalities were over Adam West and Van Williams sat down for alighthearted TV interview with an ABC correspondent. Bruce’s threat to flattenanyone who objected to a Chinese actor playing a Japanese character had clearlymade an impression. The interviewer asked Van Williams, “Kato uses a form ofkarate, yes?”“Yes, it’s a Chinese form called gung fu,” Van Williams replied. “I made themistake of sneezing when I was too close to him and I ended up flat on thefloor. He’s fast, very fast.”Adam West, switching to his Batman voice, interjected, “Faster than Robin?”“Faster than Robin.” Van Williams smiled. “Faster than a speeding bullet.”“I doubt that very much,” Adam West objected with mock indignation.“Do you see any competition?” the interviewer asked.“We’ll work this out behind closed doors,” West declared.Image [../images/sec.jpg]As filming began in June, The Green Hornet faced two major challenges. First,there was a conflict between Dozier and George Trendle, the eighty-two-year-oldcreator of The Green Hornet, over the style of the show. Hoping to ride Batman’scampy success, Dozier wanted The Green Hornet to be a similarly silly knockoff.Dozier hired Batman’s head writer, Lorenzo Semple Jr., to pen The Green Hornet’spilot script and wrote to Trendle to explain their vision: “I am sure you willagree that we can’t do straight Green Hornet stories today as they were done onradio.”But George Trendle was horrified by Batman and refused to allow his belovedcharacters to be turned into clowns. “I thought when we discussed this GreenHornet situation that we had agreed that we would play it straight,”  Trendlereplied. “I’m afraid you’re planning on making the Green Hornet a fantastic,unreal person which in my opinion would kill the show in six months.”Unable to change Trendle’s mind, Dozier had to switch The Green Hornet from acomedy to a drama. This decision compounded the show’s second disadvantage.Batman had an hour of prime time every week (two half hours on back-to-backnights) to tell its stories, but ABC decided to only give The Green Hornet onethirty-minute slot per week. Dozier was forced to squeeze a crime drama, whichis typically an hour long, into a thirty-minute sitcom’s time frame. “When westarted and I heard it was a half hour,” recalls Van Williams, “I said, ‘Uh oh,trouble.’ ” Dozier commissioned a pilot film for both Dick Tracy and WonderWoman as possible midseason replacements in case The Green Hornet was canceledearly.The troubled production was an anxious environment for the actors who werecompelled to compete for limited screen time. Bruce was still resentful abouthis demotion to sidekick and determined not to be treated like a houseboy. Whilethe rest of the cast waited for their moment in front of the camera, Bruceperformed stunts. He would put a dime on top a six-foot-high gimbal, jump intothe air, and sidekick the dime across the stage. He would do two-finger push-upsand challenge stuntmen to arm wrestling contests. Van Williams affectionatelyviewed Bruce “Never Sits Still” Lee as a rambunctious, hyperactive youngerbrother. “He was a good kid. I knew what he was doing,” Williams recalls. “Hereally wanted to show off what he could do. He didn’t have the time to do thaton-screen, because when he’d go in, he’d do one shot and it was all over. Hestarted running around and kicking and doing this, that, and the other andshowing off.”One of the ways Bruce liked to show off was to jump-kick unsuspecting people’searlobes. “I’d feel a ‘twish,’ ” says Williams. “He had jumped into the air,reached out with his toe, and ticked me on the ear.”  This continued until Bruceaccidentally injured one of the set designers. “He turned his head to talk toanother guy just at the same time Bruce kicked him on the earlobe,” Williamsremembers. “He dislocated his jaw. That ended the Bruce Lee kicking on the set.”Besides status anxiety, part of what drove Bruce’s nervous energy on-set wasimpostor syndrome. He was an amazing martial arts performer, but all hisexperience was onstage before a live audience. He had never done elaborate fightchoreography on film—his childhood Hong Kong movies were melodramas, not actionflicks. Onstage, Bruce dealt with three-dimensional space and an audienceviewing from every angle. To sell a punch or kick, he had to land withinmillimeters of the target, what he called “non-contact gung fu.” But The GreenHornet stuntmen were all veterans of Westerns. “It was a two-dimensional thingwhere you had the camera over your shoulder,” says Van Williams. “You couldstand three feet away from your opponent and swing, and if the guy reactedcorrectly and the sound effects were right, it looked perfect. Bruce could neverget used to working that far apart.”Bruce insisted on close quarters combat. The stuntmen hated it. They weren’tfast enough to react to him, and as a result, occasionally got banged up. “Theygot to the point where they didn’t want to work on that show,” Williams recalls.“They were tired of getting hurt.” “Judo” Gene LeBell, a legendary pro wrestler,world-class judoka, and the stunt coordinator on-set, was assigned the task ofcalming Bruce down. “Bruce would hit you in ten different spots and as astuntman you wouldn’t know whether to grab your jaw and say that hurt or yourstomach,” says LeBell. “We did our best to slow Bruce Lee down because theWestern way was the old John Wayne way where you reach from left field, tell astory, and then you hit the man. Bruce liked to throw thirty-seven kicks andtwelve punches.”When reasoning didn’t work, LeBell took to joshing Bruce. “In pro wrestling,they call it ‘the swerve.’ It’s how far you can tease and get away with it,”LeBell explains. “I’d tell him he put too much starch in my shirt.”One day as part of the general joking and roughhousing atmosphere on set, thestuntmen egged LeBell into picking “the little guy up.” LeBell yanked Bruce ontohis shoulder in a Crouching Nelson hold—upside down with one hand around theback. Then he slowly walked him around the set.“Put me down!” Bruce yelled. “I’m going to kill you!”“I’m not going to let you down.”“Why?”“Because you are going to kill me.”Despite the difference in temperament, the two men became friends. “I reckon Iteased him so much I eventually got him to loosen up a little,” LeBell says. ToBruce’s credit, he was so obsessed with perfecting his martial arts he put upwith the hazing to learn from LeBell. Bruce offered to exchange lessons: kung fufor judo and wrestling. “I showed him some legitimate finishing holds, leglocks, arm locks,” LeBell recalls. “He told me he used one of my holds on ChuckNorris in Way of the Dragon.”What finally convinced Bruce to modify his no-contact fight choreography wasseeing the result on film. The pilot episode, “The Silent Gun,” concluded with abig fight between the Green Hornet, Kato, and the bad guys in a darkly litunderground parking lot. Instead of correcting Bruce, Van Williams and thestuntmen decided to just let him do his thing. The next day they said to him,“Bruce, why don’t you come with us and watch the dailies?”“Oh yeah, I really want to see how that turned out,” Bruce excitedly responded.“That was some of the best stuff I’ve done.”A big group gathered to watch the unedited footage from the previous day. WhenBruce’s big scene came up, it was a complete blur. The only way anyone couldtell a fight was happening was from the kung fu noises. The stuntmen burst outlaughing. Bruce stormed to his dressing room, slammed the door, and refused tocome out.After a couple of hours, Van Williams walked over and knocked on the door.“Bruce, what are you doing in there?”“I’m very mad,” Bruce said. “I’m so upset I don’t know what to do. I’m justruined. I can’t do anything right.”“Bruce, this is what we’ve been trying to tell you. You have to slow it down.You can’t do this stuff that you do so fast that the camera can’t catch it.”Williams and Lee had a long talk and sorted out what Bruce needed to change. “ByGod he did slow it down and he really improved what he could do,” Williamsrecalls. “Once he calmed down on film and stopped jumping around on-set, he gotalong really well with everyone. He was a very loyal friend. He never talked badabout anybody behind their back or anything else.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]After the fight choreography, Bruce’s next struggle was with the depth of hisrole. In the first several episodes he was only given a few lines of dialogue.“It’s true that Kato is a houseboy of Britt, but as a crime fighter, Kato is an‘active partner’ of the Green Hornet and not a ‘mute follower,’ ” Bruce wrote toDozier. “Jeff Corey agrees and I myself feel that at least an occasionaldialogue would certainly make me ‘feel’ more at home with the fellow players.”He didn’t need to convince Dozier, who replied it was Trendle who insisted Katoremain in the background as an ally, not a companion, like Tonto—a silentminority. But Dozier promised he would deal with Trendle and ask the writers toincorporate more material involving Kato, hoping it would offer Lee somesatisfaction.In the episode “The Preying Mantis,” the writers created a Kato-centricinstallment. A Chinese restaurant is the target of a tong (Chinese mafia)protection racket. The show culminates with a contest between the tong leaderand Kato, the first time an American TV audience ever had the opportunity to seea kung fu challenge match. The quick fight, lasting only thirty seconds,featured some spectacular flying kicks by Bruce and concluded with a deadlyseries of body blows that dispatched his enemy. This must have provenparticularly satisfying to Bruce, since the tong leader was played by Mako, theJapanese American actor who had snagged the role Bruce coveted in theOscar-nominated movie The Sand Pebbles. For the sequence, Bruce hired hisdisciple, Dan Inosanto, to double for Mako—the first of many times he wouldemploy one of his students in a TV or movie project.While “The Preying Mantis” added some depth to Kato’s character, it still leftsomething to be desired. Early in the episode, the tong leader ambushes Kato andknocks him head first into a trash can—an indignity Bruce objected to but wasoverruled by Dozier. Despite this show’s focus on Chinatown, the Green Hornetdoes most of the talking. And in the final scene, everyone gathers for dinner atthe restored Chinese restaurant to celebrate—except for Kato. His absence hasled some fans to joke that Bruce must have been in back working as a busboy.The Green Hornet experience taught Bruce that he couldn’t rely on Hollywood togive him what he wanted even if he politely asked for it. He started pitchinghis own episode ideas to Dozier. In one of his plots, The Cobra from the East,the Green Hornet is sidelined early by a deadly poison, leaving Kato alone torampage across town, kicking down doors and beating up bodyguards in search ofthe cure. His thirteen-page proposal was never used, but he would incorporateelements of it into later projects.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Batman’s success turned its two leads, Adam West and Burt Ward, into unlikelysex symbols. Something about its double entendre dialogue, Spandex costumes, andcodpieces gave the series an erotic cosplay vibe. The Dynamic Duo were nearly asbesieged by groupies as the Beatles. Burt Ward’s memoir reads like a collectionof Penthouse Letters. Adam West’s, while more discreet, alludes to how much funhe and the Boy Wonder had on and off set. Between scenes Batman and Robincompeted to see who could bed Catwoman or whichever new femme fatale wasintroduced that week.While the set of the Green Hornet was by all accounts far less licentious, everyweek still brought in a new beautiful starlet. On the fifth episode, it wasThordis Brandt, a striking statuesque blonde. Born in West Germany and trainedas a nurse in Canada, she moved to Santa Monica and became one of the glamourgirls of the Swinging Sixties—playing minor parts as saloon girls, spy vixens,and cocktail waitresses in TV shows like The Girl from U.N.C.L.E., I Spy, andDragnet. In the first year of her brief career, she was cast as the mob moll inthe Green Hornet episode “The Frog Is a Deadly Weapon.”Before appearing on the show, Brandt’s agent warned her that she was VanWilliams’s type. “I walked onto the set and Van, who was so handsome, came overto say hello,” Brandt recalls. “I saw Bruce Lee standing off very shyly in theshadows. I walked over and introduced myself because I was really attracted tohim. He told me I looked like a goddess. I was dumbstruck because Bruce wasabsolutely gorgeous!”According to Brandt, they hit it off immediately and began seeing each other.“He had a magnetism that was indescribable,” says Brandt. “Bruce was very quietand shy but could be very aggressive if he wanted to be. He was a show-off andalways wanted to flaunt his body.”One day when Bruce was between scenes on The Green Hornet, he called Thordis,who was working at a different soundstage on the 20th Century Fox studio lot.She was playing Amazon #6 on the movie In Like Flint, which starred JamesCoburn.“Do you want to get lunch at the commissary?” Bruce asked.“Sure.”Bruce walked over to her soundstage in his black Kato costume. He waved toThordis and headed over to where she was filming. One of the producers, seeing aChinese guy in a valet’s uniform, intercepted him: “Hey, you are not allowedback here. You’re supposed to park around front!”Thordis ran over and yelled at the producer, “Do you know who he is? He is Katoon The Green Hornet. You don’t talk to him like that. He could kick your butt!”Instantly, the producer was all apologies. “I’m so sorry, Mr. Lee. What aterrible mistake! Please accept my apologies.” Bruce shrugged and waved off theproducer.Afterward at lunch, Thordis asked Bruce, “Does that crap ever get to you?”“No, because I know where I am going,” Bruce said, tapping a finger to his head.“I’m going this way. They are going back that way.”Thordis and Bruce’s liaison lasted for a few months until their pasts caught upwith them. Brandt was involved in a tumultuous on-again-off-again relationshipwith James Arness, the forty-three-year-old, six-foot-seven-inch star ofGunsmoke. When he found out she was dating the Chinese actor, he hired privatedetectives to investigate Bruce Lee. They quickly uncovered he was married witha young child. Arness informed Brandt. She was shocked. Bruce, who didn’t wear awedding ring, had failed to tell her. “Why ruin a good thing?”  Thordis ruefullynotes. She ended it with Bruce and went back to Arness, whom she eventuallymarried. Bruce didn’t tell Linda about the affair, and she never found out.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Part of The Green Hornet’s marketing campaign strategy was to introduce BruceLee to America as an exotic novelty. The press’s initial reaction was to playoff the popularity of Batman and position Kato as a rival to Robin. “The newestchallenge to Robin, the Boy Wonder, is Bruce Lee, a young actor and karateexpert who will portray Kato, faithful sidekick of ‘The Green Hornet,’ ” wroteThe Washington Post. Bruce insisted he would not be portraying Kato as asubservient manservant but as an equal with superior abilities. “The GreenHornet and Kato are a partnership,” Bruce said. “Actually, with my background ingung fu, they are making me the weapon. I’ll be doing all the fighting. Once ina while the Green Hornet will throw some punches, but when he goes into it, it’sthe old American swing. I’ll do all the chopping and kicking.”The press finally settled on the human-interest angle of Bruce’s interracialmarriage to Linda and their biracial child. It was less than a year before theSupreme Court’s decision in Loving v. Virginia (1967) made mixed-race marriagelegal across the country. A Chinese husband and a white wife was anonthreatening novelty the mainstream media could get behind. Some of theheadlines for these profiles were: “Bruce Lee: ‘Love Knows No Geography,’ ”“Bruce Lee: ‘Our Mixed Marriage Brought Us a Miracle of Love,’ ” and “Bruce Lee:‘I Want My Son to Be a Mixed-Up Kid!’ ”One of these articles opened with this unintentionally ironic bit of hyperbole:“There is only one thing wrong with Bruce Lee—he’s perfect! He’s a perfecthusband, perfect father, and perfectly cast in the role of Kato.” Another puffpiece began with a profound question: “How does it happen that two people fromthe opposite ends of the earth meet, fall in love, establish a true andcontented union, and bring up their children as a triumph of human grace?” Yetanother focused on the Christ-like child: “Bruce Lee and his wife, Linda, arethe parents of one of destiny’s children. His name is Brandon; he is Orientaland Occidental; he has eyes like ripe black cherries; his hair is blond; hispersonality is a fascinating blend of the thoughtfulness of the East and vigorof the West.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]The reviews of The Green Hornet’s premiere episode, “The Silent Gun,” onSeptember 9, 1966, were far less fawning than the pre-publicity. Comparing itharshly to Batman, the critics were severe about the decision to treat The GreenHornet as a somber drama rather than as a camp comedy. The New York Timesdelivered this cutting assessment: “The adventures of the latest comic striphero are purposely being played straight rather than for laughs and the show,accordingly, is just sluggish old hat rather than divertingly awful. VanWilliams portrays the Hornet as a crime buster serving out a sentence.” Varietywrote: “The Green Hornet is unrelieved straight melodrama with none of the popgags which, for better or worse, are sprinkled in the Batman script and whichaccount for at least a measure of its initial success.”For a brief moment, the show looked like it might succeed, despite the negativereviews. The Green Hornet’s ratings on ABC beat its rivals in the same timeslot—The Wild Wild West (CBS) and Tarzan (NBC)—for the first three weeks, butthen it quickly slipped behind the competition. “I think there was a great dealof curiosity about it at first, particularly because of the great success ofBatman,” Dozier explained, “and apparently now that the audience has sampledGreen Hornet, they are more inclined to prefer what they see on Wild Wild Westand Tarzan.”Despite the overall gloom, there was a silver lining for Bruce Lee. Kato provedto be a more popular character than the Green Hornet. His character received waymore fan mail from kids, like Ricky McNeece of Clinton, Iowa, who asked for aKato mask for a school project in the hopes his teacher would give him an “A.”Even negative reviews had some positive things to say about Kato’s fightingability: “Those who watched him would bet on Lee to render Cassius Claysenseless if they were put in a room and told that anything goes.” Moreimportantly to his future, Bruce and Kato were embraced by the small but growingAmerican martial arts community, who had never before seen their art performedon-screen by one of their own. Overnight, Bruce Lee became the most famousmartial artist in the country with profiles in Black Belt magazine andinvitations to headline karate tournaments—a far cry from the 1964 Long BeachInternational Karate Championships two years earlier where he was a virtualunknown.Despite the tepid ratings, ABC did not cancel and replace The Green Hornetmidseason, but instead let it limp along in the hopes its audience share mightimprove. For his part, Dozier did everything he could to save the show. Hebegged ABC to give them an hour block of time. When that failed, he beganfilming two-part episodes. He also wrote to Trendle asking permission for theGreen Hornet and Kato to cross over as “visiting heroes” on Batman as alast-ditch gimmick. The two-part telecast was scheduled for March 1 and 2, 1967,because the network’s decision about renewing The Green Hornet would be made bythe end of March.In the story, Britt Reid visits Gotham City for a publisher’s convention wherehe meets up with Bruce Wayne. As two rich WASP scions, they happen to be oldboarding school buddies, but neither knows the other’s secret identity. When theGreen Hornet and Kato stumble upon a crime involving forged stamps, they swinginto action, but Gotham authorities assume the duo is part of the conspiracy.After Batman and Robin confront the Green Hornet and Kato, a big fight ensuesuntil everyone realizes they are on the same side and they join forces to stopthe real criminals.In the original script the Green Hornet and Kato lose the brawl to Batman andRobin. After all, it was their show. But when Bruce read that, he threw thescript to the ground and walked off the set. “I’m not going to do that,” hedeclared. “There’s no way that I’m going to get into a fight with Robin andlose. That makes me look like an idiot!” His complaint made its way up toDozier, who came down from his office to hear it out. Bruce was adamant:“There’s no way anybody would believe that I would get in a fight with Robin andlose. I refuse to do it. It will make me look like the laughing stock of theworld.”Dozier asked Van Williams his opinion. Personally, Williams didn’t care if theGreen Hornet lost a fight to Batman or not, but he backed up his loyal sidekick:“I agree with Bruce.”“Fine it will be a draw,” Dozier decided. “Nobody wins or loses, a Mexicanstand-off. Can you live with that, Bruce?”“Okay,” Bruce replied.Bruce and Burt Ward (Robin) were friends. When they lived in the same apartmentcomplex, Bruce shared some basic kung fu techniques with him. But Bruce heardthat Ward was telling people he was a black belt like Bruce, and it offendedhim. “Bruce was very popular with the kids, and they were asking Robin, ‘Can youdo that thing that Kato does?’ ” Van Williams recalls. “And Robin would say,‘Oh, yeah, I’m a black belt. Watch this: EEW-WHA-HA!’ and he’d do this littlestance, which was a joke.”Before shooting began, Bruce told everyone, “I’m going to light into Robin andshow him how it is really done and then we’ll see how great a black belt youare, boy!” By the time filming started, Burt Ward was shaking in his Spandex. Asan insurance policy, he begged Batman’s stuntmen to intervene if Bruce tore intohim.Bruce swaggered onto the set with a stern expression. He silently paced back andforth, refusing to kid around with the crew, which was very unusual. “Bruce wasalways joking and playing around,” Williams says. After some warm-ups, heshifted into a fighting stance, clenched his teeth, squinted his eyes, andstared down Robin from behind his Kato mask. Ward as Robin stood a good distanceaway and tried to make small talk. Bruce ignored him. Finally, the directorshouted, “Action!”With his killer expression and dead eyes, Bruce inched his way toward his prey.Ward slowly backed away, crying out, “Bruce, remember this is not for real. It’sjust a show!”As Kato crowded Robin into a corner, Ward began flapping his elbows and jumpingaround in a circle. One of the stuntmen in back whispered, “It’s the blackpanther and the yellow chicken.”Hearing that, Bruce burst out laughing. “I couldn’t keep a straight faceanymore,” Bruce recalled. Van Williams, Adam West, and the entire crew howled atthe practical joke. Rumors that Burt Ward wet himself are unconfirmed. “Luckyfor Robin that it was not for real,” Bruce said. “Otherwise, he would have beenone dead bird.”When the show aired, the announcer declared it, “A Mexican standoff, a deadheat, a photo finish,” but Bruce made sure to adjust the fight choreography sohe came off better. After a few exchanges of punches and kicks, the fracasfinished with Kato delivering a spinning hook kick to Robin’s face that sent himflying over a desk.The crossover broadcast never generated the volume of fan letters or the bump inratings that Dozier and Trendle had hoped for. “It was dumb,” Van Williams says.“Batman was playing the thing for laughs and we were playing it straight and itjust didn’t work at all.” In April 1967, ABC announced it would not renew TheGreen Hornet for a second season.“Confucius say, ‘Green Hornet to buzz no more,’ ” Dozier wrote to Bruce at hishome in Inglewood. “I’m sorry, as I know you must be. You worked very hard, andvery well, and I believe you made a lot of friends for yourself, as well asrespectful admirers. It has been a great joy to me, both personally andprofessionally, to work with you.”Lee graciously replied to Dozier: “I’d like to take this opportunity to thankyou personally for all that you’ve done to start my career in show business.Without you, I would never have thought about being in Hollywood. I’ve gainedtremendous experience from The Green Hornet and believe I’ve improved steadilysince the first show—that of minimizing and hacking away the unessential. Myattitude in this business is to take things as they are, and to look up to thesky ‘with feet firmly on solid ground.’ ”And just like that Bruce Lee became that most common of fauna in SouthernCalifornia: the unemployed actor. “When the series ended I asked myself, ‘Whatthe hell do I do now?’ ”"},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f0196-01.jpg]In the center: Dan Inosanto, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and shirtless Bruce Lee.

(David Tadman)"},{"pageContent":"ELEVENJEET KUNE DOWith his acting career in doubt, Bruce Lee returned to teaching kung fu. Asfilming for The Green Hornet was winding down, he opened the Los Angeles branchof the Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute in Chinatown at 628 College Street. The openhouse seminar was held from 8 to 9 p.m. on February 9, 1967. Dan Inosanto—anassistant instructor for Ed Parker who had been training secretly with Bruce fora year—quietly invited a large group of Parker’s senior students to the event.For an hour, Bruce explained his philosophy and what he would be teaching. Heoccasionally would call somebody up to demonstrate one of his points. “You couldsee his superiority, and it was obvious he was ahead of a whole lot of people,”says Bob Bremer, a student of Parker’s. “I jumped ship right then.”After the seminar, everyone else jumped ship as well. It caused some hardfeelings. “They nicknamed us ‘the turncoats,’ ” says Bremer. The close-knitgroup of defectors included Dan Lee, Jerry Poteet, Bob Bremer, Larry Hartsell,Richard Bustillo, Pete Jacobs, and Steve Golden. “Parker wasn’t thrilled withthe situation,” says Golden. “But for the last year before I left, Ed wasspending more and more time dealing with Hollywood, serving as Elvis Presley’sbodyguard. He was not teaching me. So who left whom?” Bruce named Inosanto hisassistant instructor. Dan tried to maintain ties by teaching six days a week forboth Parker and Bruce, but after several months it became too much and he joinedBruce full-time.Like his very first kwoon in Seattle, Bruce conceived of his L.A. branch more asan exclusive private club than a commercial school. New students had to besponsored by an existing member, and the first six months were a tryout. TheChinatown kwoon didn’t have any signage out front, the windows were covered withthe pink window cleaner Glass Wax, the front door was kept locked, and there wasa secret knock: three raps, a pause, and then two raps. “I don’t want too manyin my organization,” Bruce explained. “The fewer students I have and the harderit is for anyone to join will give my club more prestige and importance. Likeanything else, if it’s too popular and too easy to join, people won’t think toohighly of it.”For the first few months, Bruce ran the school like a boot camp. He focused onphysical conditioning: fitness, flexibility, and basic punching and kickingdrills. Members trained four times a week. The two-hour sessions were alwaysgrueling. Quite a few people quit after a few weeks. “Bruce was testing oursincerity and willingness to train hard,” says Dan Lee (no relation). “Thefitness program finally eased off at the fourth month, and he began trainingthose who remained.”Bruce’s club was the opposite of a strip mall Karate McDojo. There were nouniforms, no ranks, no colored belts, no bowing, and no titles. Everyone was ona first-name basis: Bruce was Bruce; Danny was Danny. Partly as a joke, butmainly to dramatize his philosophy in physical form, Bruce erected on a tablenear the front door a miniature tombstone inscribed with the words: “In memoryof the once fluid man, crammed and distorted by the classical mess.”Classes, which averaged twelve students, started with stretching andcalisthenics before proceeding to basic techniques: footwork, punching, kicking,trapping, and a lot of questions and answers. “He emphasized footwork, footwork,footwork, and more footwork,” says Jerry Poteet. “He was trying to get us to bemore mobile.”  The second half of the two-hour classes was spent on hardsparring. “It was always intense and combative,” says Bustillo.During breaks, he would show his students 16mm films of classic boxing matches,slowing it down during key moments. “Okay, now, watch where the punch is comingfrom,” Bruce would narrate. “It’s not the hand or the arm, it’s the waist, andit’s BOOM!” Classes often incorporated music. Joe Torrenueva, who worked as ahairstylist for Jay Sebring, would play his Latin conga drums to demonstraterhythm and timing. Bruce was very hands-on. He made sure everyone was doingeverything correctly—it had to be precise. He examined every student carefully,tested and recorded their progress in a notebook. After a few months, he handedout typewritten notes with his observations and a supplemental training programfor each of them. “To my surprise, they were all different,” says Dan Lee.Bruce’s goal was to improve his students’ skill level to the point where theywere good enough to spar with him. Once this was accomplished, he turned overmost of the day-to-day teaching at the school to Inosanto, who was better withlarger groups, and shifted to private lessons with a select group of seniorstudents—Ted Wong, Dan Lee, Jerry Poteet, Herb Jackson, Mito Uyehara, BobBremer, and Peter Chin. Ted Wong, who spoke Cantonese, became Bruce’s protégé.Herb Jackson fixed the equipment and served Bruce his tea. Bruce would waituntil Jackson left the room and then joke, “I always wanted a Caucasianhouseboy.”Every Wednesday evening, the crew converged in Bruce’s kitchen at his CulverCity rental home. They were greeted by his friendly Great Dane, Bobo—aslobbering, clumsy 150-pound dog who knocked down anything in his way, includingchairs, lamps, and even four-year-old Brandon. Neither Bruce nor Linda couldcontrol him. “We even had him at a training school,” Linda smiled. “He’s theonly dog I know that ever flunked out.”The ranch-style house had a great room with a high ceiling that was so big Bruceconverted half of it into a gym with a speed bag, heavy bag, and otherspecialized equipment. After warming up on the bags inside the house andcovering fundamentals like broken rhythm and bridging the gap, the crew headedoutside to the fenced-in backyard to spar. Bruce was one of the first martialarts instructors to introduce protective gear—boxing gloves, headgear, chestprotectors, and shin guards. In traditional karate dojos, students would sparbare-fisted and stop their punches an inch before making contact. Bruce believed“touch sparring” was unrealistic, calling it “swimming on dry land,” andinsisted on full contact. “Bruce’s way of training was overpowering,” recallsMito Uyehara. “When he tired me out, he would then pick on Ted Wong. Bruce wouldnever quit until we did. He enjoyed seeing both Wong and myself giving up.”Bruce didn’t charge any money for these backyard sessions, because they weren’treally lessons. He was experimenting with new methods, tactics, and techniquesto create his own system of martial arts, and his students were, in their ownestimation, his “kicking dummies.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]On July 9, 1967, Bruce gave his new approach to the martial arts a Cantonesename, Jeet Kune Do. He came up with the Chinese term first and then asked a UCLAlinguistics professor to translate it for him into English—“stop fist way” or,more broadly, “the way of the intercepting fist.”“What does that mean?” Dan Inosanto asked Bruce as they drove down the highway.“There are three opportunities to strike an opponent: before he attacks, duringhis attack, or after he attacks,” Bruce explained. “Jeet Kune Do means tointercept before he attacks—to intercept his movement, his thoughts, or hismotive.”Appropriately for a Eurasian born in America and raised in British colonial HongKong, Jeet Kune Do was a hybrid system, mixing East and West. “You have to gooutside your environment to achieve something better,” he told Dan. “Some peoplewill say, ‘Hey, that’s a Korean kick. We can’t use that kick.’ But I don’t care.It all belongs to mankind.”From boxing Bruce took its superior footwork and from kung fu its kicks. Butwhat made his fusion unique, rather than just another kickboxing amalgamation,were the major elements he adapted from fencing. His brother Peter, whom Brucerevered and envied, was an elite fencer in high school and taught Bruce some ofthe basics. But it wasn’t until Bruce moved to America that he took the sportseriously. “I can remember at the beginning showing him the art of fencing andhe could get nowhere near me with a sword,” recalls Peter. “When he came back in1965 for my father’s funeral, we went at it again and I could not touch him.That’s the way Bruce was: always secretly practicing.” Bruce also becamefascinated with fencing theory. His library contained sixty-eight books onfencing—his favorites were by Aldo Nadi, Julio Martinez Castello, and RogerCrosnier. The term Jeet Kune Do or “stop fist way” came from the fencingtechnique “stop hit.” In his notes, Bruce described Jeet Kune Do as “fencingwithout a sword.”Unlike boxers, who place their weak side forward, Bruce used a fencer’s on-guardposition: strong side crouching forward, right hand extended as if holding asword, and left heel raised and cocked to explode off the blocks when bridgingthe gap. His favorite attack was the finger jab to the eyes—the technique heused against Wong Jack Man. “Faced with the choice of socking your opponent inthe head and poking him in the eyes, you go for the eyes every time,” Brucewrote in his notes. “Like a fencer’s sword that is always in line, the leadingfinger jab is a constant threat to your opponent.” In Wing Chun, Bruce had beentaught to fight in close and use trapping techniques (chi sao—sticky hands) tocontrol his opponent. With Jeet Kune Do, he stepped back to a fencer’s distanceand lunged forward to attack before leaping backward to safety.Jeet Kune Do was Bruce Lee’s personal expression of the martial arts. Like acustom-made suit, he tailored it to take advantage of his innate aggressiveness,preternatural reflexes, and uncanny ability to read an opponent. “Sparring withBruce was so frustrating because he would be on you before you could evenreact,” says Jhoon Rhee, the Father of American Tae Kwon Do. One evening whenBob Bremer complained that Bruce was simply too fast for him, Bruce explained itwasn’t an issue of speed: “There’s a split second when you are not with me andsomehow I seem to know when that is.” Jesse Glover, his first student inAmerica, says, “The thing that made him so effective was the fact that he couldpick up a potential movement before it happened. Many of his advanced conceptswere based on this type of detection. The question is how much of his thinkingat this stage of his development is transferable to the average person.” Bruce’sproblem as a teacher was that he could pass on his ideas, but not his talent,and you needed both for Jeet Kune Do to work.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Bruce knew by heart the “Ave Maria” and other Catholic prayers. He could recitelong biblical passages from memory. Despite his resistance, the CatholicBrothers at La Salle had pounded Christianity into his head. But unlike hismother, he was not a believer. He was an atheist—perhaps because he could nottolerate the idea of an authority higher than his own. When asked by Esquiremagazine if he believed in God, Bruce replied, “Ah, to be perfectly frank, Ireally do not.” If his friends brought up the subject, he would joke, “I don’tbelieve in anything. I believe in sleeping.” He was practical by nature, a bitof a materialist—all traits in the Hong Kong tradition.Yet Bruce had a spiritual, even a mystical, side to him. He was a seeker and abibliophile. He haunted the philosophy section of bookstores looking foranswers. One of his early career dreams, before he realized he could make aliving as a kung fu instructor, was to own a used bookstore. His personallibrary would grow to more than 2,500 books. “Bruce carried a book with himwherever he went,” says Linda. “I frequently saw him sitting quietly readingwhile there was household uproar all around him—children crying, doors slamming,conversations taking place everywhere. Bruce was able to read a book whileperforming a series of strenuous exercises.” In his notepads, Bruce copied downpassages from his favorite authors: Plato, Hume, Descartes, and Aquinas from theWestern tradition; Lao-tzu, Chuang-tzu, Miyamoto Musashi, and Alan Watts fromthe Eastern.One of his most important influences was the renegade Indian mystic JidduKrishnamurti. Selected at age fourteen by the occultist Theosophical Society asthe predestined “World Teacher,” Krishnamurti was groomed to become its leaderand “direct the evolution of mankind towards perfection.” In 1929 at the age ofthirty-four, he shocked his adoptive cult by renouncing his role as the WorldTeacher, arguing that religious doctrines and organizations stood in the way ofreal truth. “I maintain that truth is a pathless land, and you cannot approachit by any religion. A belief is purely an individual matter, and you cannot andmust not organize it. If you do, it becomes dead, crystallized; it becomes acreed, a sect, a religion, to be imposed on others.”Krishnamurti’s teachings reinforced Lee’s instinctive rejection of universaltruths and traditions in favor of individual ones. In a 1971 TV interview withPierre Berton, Bruce adapted Krishnamurti’s words to the martial arts: “I do notbelieve in styles anymore. Styles separate men, because they have their owndoctrine and then the doctrine becomes the gospel truth. But if you do not havestyles, if you just say, ‘Here I am as a human being. How can I express myselftotally and completely?’ Now this way you will not create a style—because astyle is a crystallization—this way is a process of continuing growth.”The irony was Bruce had created a distinct style of martial arts. His responsewas to insist that Jeet Kune Do was his personal system, and his students neededto follow their own path. He was a guide, not a teacher. “Jeet Kune Do is merelya name used, a boat to get one across the river,” Bruce said, “and once across,is to be discarded, and not to be carried on one’s back.” Employing theparadoxical structure of Zen koans, he called Jeet Kune Do “the style of nostyle” and made his school slogan: “Using No Way As Way; Having No Limitation AsLimitation.”“It was the sixties,” Dan Inosanto jokes. “Everybody talked that way.”Bruce was not interested in politics but he sensed the countercultural mood ofthe country and applied it to the martial arts. “Everyone was questioning ourgovernment. We didn’t believe they were leading us down the right path,”Inosanto explains. “Bruce was antiestablishment—the voice of the sixties. Hequestioned everything. He said, ‘If you don’t question it, you can’t grow.’ ”Over time, Jeet Kune Do became less about specific stances or fightingtechniques and more about a philosophical approach to the martial arts and life.Question tradition but be practical: “Adapt what is useful, reject what isuseless.” Find your personal truth: “Add what is specifically your own.” Andcontinue to evolve. “He once told me that Jeet Kune Do in 1968 will be differentin 1969,” recalls Inosanto. “And 1969 Jeet Kune Do will be different than 1970.”In contrast to Chinese Confucian reverence for the past and deference to thecollective, Bruce drew deeply from the American ideal of individualism,philosophy of pragmatism, and focus on the future—in order to form a moreperfect person.Fists and feet were weapons to use physically against an opponent andspiritually against one’s own ego, greed, and anger—a means of self-defense andself-enlightenment. “In this respect, Jeet Kune Do is directed toward oneself,”Bruce said. Krishnamurti stated as his goal, “I am concerning myself with onlyone essential thing: to set man free.” Similarly, Bruce declared, “The final aimof Jeet Kune Do is toward personal liberation. It points the way to individualfreedom and maturity.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]When it came to training, Bruce Lee was on the cutting edge of the fitnessrevolution. He was the first martial artist to train like a modern athlete. Atthat time, traditional stylists thought it was sufficient to repeat basictechniques as their primary form of exercise. It was a widespread view.Professional football players in the 1960s considered weightlifting to bedangerous and detrimental—many NFL teams banned it. Bruce recognized thatstrength and conditioning were crucial to becoming the ultimate fighter.After his exhausting fight with Wong Jack Man, Bruce redoubled his efforts toimprove his endurance. “An out-of-condition athlete, when tired, cannot performwell,” Bruce explained. “You can’t throw your punches or kicks properly and youcan’t even get away from your opponent.” From boxing, he borrowed skipping ropeand roadwork. Every morning he would run four or five miles through hisneighborhood with his Great Dane, Bobo. “Jogging is not only a form of exerciseto me,” Bruce said. “It is also a form of relaxation. It is my own hour everymorning when I can be alone with my thoughts.”Since he was a teenager, Bruce had lifted weights, but he didn’t become seriousabout it until his Oakland years. His students James Yimm Lee and Allen Joe werepioneers in the early era of bodybuilding and showed him basic lifts and generalexercises with weights. Bruce was interested in strength not size; he wanted tobe ripped not bulky, recognizing that speed is more important to power thanmass. “James and I were into heavy weight training,” Allen Joe says, “but Brucewent with lighter weights with higher repetitions.” In his garage, Bruceinstalled an isometric machine, squat rack, bench press, dumbbells, and gripmachine for his forearms.Bruce was a fanatic about training and he had the free time to do it. As one ofhis L.A. students enviously noted, “To Bruce every day seemed like a weekendbecause he never had a steady job like most of us.” From Monday to Sunday heroutinely did the same thing: He jogged in the morning and then sharpened hismartial tools with five hundred punches, five hundred finger jabs, and fivehundred kicks. In the afternoon, he spent time in his library—reading philosophybooks, calling up his agent or his pals. In the early evening he lifted weightsthree nights per week.Even when he wasn’t officially training he was training. While watching TV, hecurled dumbbells. While driving his car, he would repeatedly punch a smallmakiwara board—much to the distress and anxiety of his passengers. He turnedevery activity into martial arts play. “When I’m putting on my pants,” Brucesaid, “I’m doing a balancing act.”All of this exercise put a tremendous strain on his fragile frame. He spenthours every week practicing a rapid sidekick even when his knees were hurting.As a result, his knees always made a clicking sound when he whipped his footout. He sweated profusely as if constantly on the verge of overheating. “BruceLee always seemed to be wet. Even in an air-conditioned room, as soon as hegesticulated, he would quickly perspire,” says Mito Uyehara. “One night he rodehis exercycle for 45 minutes without stopping. When he got through he wascompletely drenched. Even the floor beneath him was so wet that it had to bemopped right away.”To help his body recover, he began using an electrical muscle stimulatormachine. Karate champion Mike Stone, who learned about the device while teachingkarate to Los Angeles Rams football players, introduced Bruce to it. “It’s minorelectric shock treatment that you put on your muscles to increase their pulseand repetition,” Mike Stone says. “The NFL used electro-stim machines to rebuildinjured areas. Bruce believed it would enhance his skill and ability. But hewent over the top. One to ten, he would crank the dial up to seven or eight,enough to curl his hair.” Bruce continued to use the electro-stim machine forthe rest of his life—freaking out friends and colleagues, particularly theChinese in Hong Kong. “When I got to the door of his office, I didn’t dare goin, because he was wearing a headband with a bunch of electrical cables attachedto it,” recalls Bolo Yeung, the beefy bad guy in Enter the Dragon. “My immediatereaction was ‘Are you crazy?’ ”Bruce was equally adventurous in his diet. He believed in the curative powers ofginseng and queen bee honey. He subscribed to all the fitness magazines of theday—Strength & Health, Ironman, Muscle Builder, Mr. America, MuscularDevelopment, and Muscle Training Illustrated—and purchased many of the faddishfitness supplements they advertised. Several times a day he took a high-proteindrink made up of Rheo Blair Protein Powder, ice water, powdered milk, eggs,eggshells, bananas, vegetable oil, peanut flour, and chocolate ice cream. Hehaunted health food stores and bought tons of vitamins, in particular anythingpromoted by Jack LaLanne. Along with protein smoothies, he also blended rawhamburger beef and drank it. “The thing that really scared me was when he wasdrinking beef blood,” recalls movie star James Coburn.His obsession with training and nutrition was not only about performance butalso aesthetics. His passion may have been the martial arts but his professionwas acting. At that time if you had a barrel chest like William Holden or RobertMitchum, you qualified as a hunk. (Once when asked how he maintained his thenenvied physique, Mitchum replied, “I breathe in and out all of the time. Andonce in awhile I grudgingly lift something—like a chair.”) Bruce wanted to playheroic leading roles, and he knew, as an Asian man with a shorter frame andslighter build, he needed to outwork his white counterparts to create amusculature that immediately conveyed power in the visual medium of movies.“He was a little pudgy and had a little baby fat on him when I first met him,”recalls Van Williams, the star of The Green Hornet. “He didn’t have muscledefinition. He wanted that badly. That’s what he really started to work on oncehe got the role of Kato.” From little definition in The Green Hornet (1966), hecreated a hypertrophied body that looked like it was sculpted out of marble inWay of the Dragon (1972). “From the Oakland period to the days in Hollywood whenI went to see him, his body changed,” says George Lee, one of his Oaklandstudents. “He was much more developed and it was amazing he could develop a bodyas quick as he did.”The change in his physique was so dramatic it has led some to speculate aboutsteroid use. While it is possible he tried them, there is no evidence to suggestregular use. Bruce loved to show off all his new experiments, even cow’s blood,but no one recalls him ever mentioning steroids. If he used them, he kept itsecret, and there was no reason back then to be ashamed of steroids. They hadbeen approved by the FDA for human use in 1958 and were considered safe untilthe 1980s. Anabolic steroids dramatically increase muscle mass and as a resultcause large gains in weight. But Bruce’s weight remained steady—never risingabove 145 pounds. He was shredded, not pumped like Arnold Schwarzenegger. Hisincredible muscular definition was the result of constant training and cuttinghis subcutaneous body fat down to almost zero.Image [../images/sec.jpg]American audiences may have shrugged at The Green Hornet, but it was adored bythe martial arts community, who claimed Bruce Lee as its first breakout star.Mito Uyehara, the publisher of Black Belt magazine, quickly realized the benefitof associating his magazine with Bruce’s celebrity. In October 1967, Mitopublished a glowing profile: “A vibrant personality with piercing black eyes anda rather handsome face full of animation, unlike the inscrutable poker-faceexpressions Westerners usually associate with the Oriental.” For Bruce’s part,he viewed Black Belt, the leading martial arts magazine in the country, as anexcellent platform to promote himself and his message: “Classical methods, whichI consider a form of paralysis, only solidify and condition what was oncefluid.” As their mutually beneficial friendship deepened, Mito touted histalents as an instructor.One day in 1968 the offices of Black Belt came to a screeching halt as the bestcollege basketball player in the country walked into the display room to browseover some books. Standing at seven-foot-two-inches, his name was Lew Alcindor,although he would later change it to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Alcindor had justreturned to Los Angeles from New York to finish his senior year at UCLA. In NewYork he had studied Aikido and wanted to continue his training.“Do you have any books on Tai Chi?” he asked.“Sorry, we don’t,” Mito answered. “But if you would like to know about anyChinese martial art, I know someone who can help you.”“Who’s that?”“Have you ever heard of Bruce Lee?” Mito asked. “He was Kato on TV’s GreenHornet series.”“No, I never watch those shows.”That night Mito drove over to Bruce’s house to tell him the big news: “Guess whois going to be your next student?”“Who?”“Lew Alcindor!” Mito exclaimed as if unwrapping an expensive gift.“Who’s that?”“What? Everyone knows Lew Alcindor,” he said, incredulous. “He’s the mostsought-after college athlete in the country today.”“How would I know him?” Bruce shrugged. “Shit, I don’t know anything aboutbasketball, baseball, or football. They only time I ever got close to anAmerican athlete was when I had to walk across the football field in college.”Bruce paused for a moment and stared at Mito. “What’s so special about thisAlcindor guy?”“He’ll be the highest paid athlete coming out of college,” Mito replied. “Forsomeone that tall, he’s supposed to be real smooth and quick.”“How tall is he?”“He claims to be seven-foot-two but many think he’s closer to seven-foot-four.”Suddenly five-foot-seven Bruce pulled out a chair and jumped on it. “Linda, geta measuring tape,” Bruce called out. She held it to the floor as Bruce stretchedthe tape until he came to seven-foot-two. He dropped the tape but left his handextended in midair, eyeing the distance from the floor to his hand.“Hell, he’s not that tall,” he scoffed. “I’d like to meet him. I wonder how itfeels to spar a guy that tall. Can you arrange for me to see him?”About a week later, Lew and Bruce got together. Bruce was stunned to see whatseven-foot-two looked like in the flesh. He was so awed by Alcindor’s heightthat he kept muttering, “Boy, I never realized anyone could be so tall.”Alcindor told him he was interested in Tai Chi. “Forget Tai Chi. It’s for oldmen in parks,” Bruce declared. “You should learn Jeet Kune Do.”Alcindor lost all interest in Tai Chi and became Bruce’s private student duringhis final year at UCLA. “I saw Bruce as a renegade Taoist priest,” says achuckling Abdul-Jabbar. “He was into spirituality and it was heavily influencedby Taoism. But you couldn’t put him in that box—he was beyond that. We worked onspecific things, footwork for example, how to use the dummy or hitting the bag.”They also sparred. “Lew was too slow. He could never touch me,” Bruce told Mito.“But he has such long arms and legs, it was impossible for me to hit his face orbody. The only target open was his lead knee and shin. In a real fight, I wouldhave to bust his legs.” Bruce was amazed by Alcindor’s physical abilities: “Thesonovagun has powerful legs. He kicks like a mule. And he sure can leap. Hejumped toward a basketball rim and hit it with a front kick.”When the Milwaukee Bucks drafted Alcindor in 1969 for $1.5 million, he went toBruce for help. He wanted to add thirty more pounds of muscle to compete againstbulkier centers like Wilt Chamberlain. Bruce put him on a special diet and gavehim a weightlifting program. “Being in the best shape you can be will absolutelyenhance all aspects of your game on the basketball court,” Bruce told Lew.After Alcindor moved away, Bruce stayed in touch. In the back of his mind, Brucekept imagining how to choreograph a fight scene with Big Lew on film. “With mefighting a guy over seven feet tall, the Chinese fans would eat it up,” Brucetold Mito. “It would be something they’ve never seen before. I can picture theirreactions when I do a sidekick straight to his face.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]Although Bruce’s role as Kato gave him Hollywood cachet in the martial artscommunity, the most esteemed martial artists of that era were the karate pointfighting champions. In these contests held across the country, blows were onlyallowed above the waist, not to the legs or groin. Attacks to the torso could befull force, but anything to the head was halted before making contact.Contestants could be penalized for striking too hard to the face. Once acompetitor landed a punch or kick to the torso or face, the judge jumped in,separated the fighters, declared a point, and then restarted the contest.Bruce had no interest in competing under point fighting’s restrictive rules,what he called a “one touch and run game.” He grew up fighting in kung fuchallenge matches where contestants pounded on each other until somebody wasunconscious or verbally submitted. But to gain the respect of the martial artscommunity he needed to associate himself in some way with the karate champions.Bruce Lee was introduced to Mike Stone at the 1964 Long Beach InternationalKarate Championships after Stone beat Chuck Norris and won the tournament. WhenBruce opened his Chinatown school in 1967, he invited Stone to visit. Afterdemonstrating the basic concepts and techniques of Jeet Kune Do, Bruce said toMike, “You know this school is pretty far away from where you live. Maybe youcould just come over to my house. I have a little gym set up. We can work outtogether in the backyard. Say once a week or something like that.”Mike was interested but hesitant. He had been losing recently and was keen topick up some new tricks to help him start winning again. Like every good-lookingguy in L.A., he was also eager to get into the movie business and viewed Bruceas a good connection. But Stone was one of the country’s three best karatefighters—along with Joe Lewis and Chuck Norris—and he didn’t want anyone tothink Kato was better than him. Knowing Stone couldn’t publicly accept a formalteacher-student relationship, Bruce carefully phrased it as “working outtogether” rather than “private lessons.” With that face-saving understanding,Mike finally agreed.In their first session on September 30, 1967, Bruce sought to establish hissuperiority. He challenged Mike to an arm wrestling contest. Then he asked Miketo hold the heavy bag. “Stand with your back to it, and I’ll kick it,” Brucesaid. “I want to show you how much power I have.” It continued in this vein forthe rest of the night.Mike kept coming back. There were seven lessons over a six-month period. Bruceadmired Stone’s skill at karate forms (katas) and taught him a Wing Chun form.They also studied old boxing films and books about the martial arts. Stone’sfavorite part of each four-to-five-hour session were the conversations the twomen held over a bowl of noodles.Interestingly, they never sparred. Bruce frequently sparred with his otherstudents but not Mike. Instead these two competitive and proud men worked outtogether, while simultaneously studying each other—looking for weaknesses,strategizing how to best the other. “When you stand with another man or watchhim, me as a fighter, I’m already picking him apart,” Stone says. “In my mind, Iam looking for the opportunities, for the openings, for the habitual things thathe does.”Both of them were certain they could beat the other guy. From Stone’sperspective, Bruce was a talented martial artist with some interesting ideas,but not a real fighter because he didn’t compete in karate point fightingtournaments. In the opposite corner, Bruce didn’t think much of karate pointfighters, because karate was a derivative and inferior style of kung fu andpoint fighting was not much more than an aggressive game of tag. But neither ofthem put their certainty to the test, because there was no upside. If Mike won,Bruce would stop training him and Mike would lose a useful Hollywood connection.If Bruce won, Mike would stop training with him and Bruce would lose ahigh-profile, reputation-enhancing “student.”Despite their egos, the sessions were a lot of fun and filled with laughter.“Bruce was like a kid as far as his enthusiasm and bubbly personality wereconcerned,” recalls Stone. “He was always clowning around and cracking jokes andjust keeping everybody in good spirits. He was great that way.”While training with Bruce, Stone became increasingly interested in translatinghis popularity as a champion karate fighter into a career in entertainment. Tothat end, he formed a nightclub act with Joe Lewis, the top heavyweight pointfighter, and Bob Wall, who would later play the bad guy O’Hara in Enter theDragon (1973). At the end of the act, Lewis and Stone would give a karatedemonstration. One evening, Lewis noticed that Stone’s style of fighting hadchanged.“I’m working out with this Chinese guy named Bruce Lee,” Stone explained. “Hewants to work with you. You should go down and start taking lessons with him.”Joe Lewis first ran into Bruce Lee at Black Belt’s offices. Lewis, who also hada big but fragile ego, was there to complain about how Black Belt had misspelledhis name in the previous issue. As he was leaving, Bruce chased him into theparking lot: “Ah, Joe, Joe, Joe, let me talk to you for a second.” For the nextthirty minutes, Bruce launched into a discourse about why Jeet Kune Do wassuperior to Lewis’s style and how it could help him improve his results inkarate tournaments. Lewis, who was already a champion, stood there politely andignored everything Bruce said. “I was an American fighter and didn’t think muchof kung fu fighters, because most of them didn’t fight. Instead, they indulgedin constant practice of their many long forms, painting the air with theirfingers,” Lewis explains. “Also I didn’t respect little guys.”Despite this bad first impression, Stone was able to convince Lewis that it wasworth his while to train with Bruce. Like Stone, Lewis also wanted to get intothe movie business. He called up Bruce and arranged for a lesson on January 25,1968. “Once a week I would go and take a private lesson with Bruce and spend thewhole rest of the week working on what he was showing me. And it actually in agreat way improved my fighting style,” says Lewis. “I was already a two timenational champion before I started working with Bruce. He helped accelerate mycareer. In 1968, when we were working out extensively, I won eleven consecutiveGrand Championships without a loss. What Bruce showed me enabled me to do that.He was a true master and master teacher. But I’d say his main quality was hischarm. He could charm anybody.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]The success of the 1964 Long Beach International Karate Championships led to anexplosion of karate tournaments across the country. After The Green Hornet, allof the promoters wanted Kato as their headline performer. For the 1967 LongBeach Championships, Ed Parker featured Kato extensively in his advertisements.Over ten thousand spectators came—a record crowd at a karate tournament—many ofthem young kids who had dragged their fathers along. After Bruce’s demonstration(one-inch punch, closing the gap, sparring with full protective gear), the crowdgave him a huge standing ovation and then about half the audience left. Theyweren’t interested in karate, just in Kato.At a tournament in Fresno he was mobbed by riotous fans, who scratched, kicked,and gouged to get near him. The experience terrified him. There were so manypeople he felt powerless to protect himself. “A surprising number were youngwomen,” Linda notes.At the 1967 All American Karate Championships, Bruce had a ringside seat inMadison Square Garden for one of the seminal point fighting contests:middleweight Chuck Norris versus heavyweight Joe Lewis for the grandchampionship. Like Lewis and most American karate stars of the era, Chuck Norrisbegan studying the martial arts when he joined the military and was stationed inEast Asia. Norris, who grew up with an alcoholic father, was nonathletic,scholastically mediocre, and debilitatingly shy as a child. The martial artsgave him a sense of structure, discipline, and self-confidence, and he threwhimself into competitions with a singularity of focus.The introverted Norris wore an all-white karate gi with a black belt. The brashJoe Lewis was in a white top and black karate pants with a red belt. They facedeach other in a horse stance, left legs forward and fists at their waists. Forthe first few seconds the only movement was Norris shifting his shoulders fromleft to right. As soon as Lewis raised his left foot to feint a kick, Norrisleapt forward with a sidekick that Lewis blocked. Over the next ten seconds,Lewis slowly inched toward Norris, backing him to the edge of the mat. Lewissuddenly jumped at Norris with a sidekick that Norris blocked. Norrisimmediately countered with a sidekick of his own followed by a punch and anothersidekick that landed on Lewis’s torso. The judge scored a point to Norris, whoheld off Lewis for the rest of the match to eke out a one-point victory.When the tournament ended at 11 p.m., Chuck Norris and Bruce Lee were introducedto each other. As they headed to the main lobby, they ran into a horde of fanswaiting to pounce and were forced to make a hasty exit through a side door.After discovering they were staying at the same hotel, they walked backtogether, talking the entire time about the martial arts and their philosophies.Norris was exhausted—he had fought thirteen matches in the past eleven hours—butthe conversation was so engaging he followed Bruce up to his room where theybegan working out and exchanging techniques. “The next time I looked at mywatch, it was 7:00 a.m.! We had worked out together for seven hours!” recallsNorris. “Bruce was so dynamic that it had seemed like only twenty minutes tome.”As Norris left the room for some much-needed sleep, Bruce said, “When we getback to Los Angeles, let’s start working out together.”On October 20, 1967, Norris began training with Bruce in the secluded backyardof his modest home in Culver City. Because Norris was, like Mike Stone,sensitive about status, he would later insist that these were “workouts” ratherthan “private lessons”—two equals exchanging techniques rather than ateacher-student or coach-fighter relationship. “Bruce didn’t believe in highkicks. He kicked only below the waist. I finally convinced him that it wasimportant to be versatile enough to kick anywhere. Within six months he couldkick with precision, power, and speed to any area of the body,” Norris claimed.“In return, he taught me some kung-fu techniques, including linear or straightpunches that I was able to use in my repertoire.” (In fact, Bruce learned how tohigh kick as a teenager in Hong Kong; Norris may have helped refine histechnique.)One of Norris’s most vivid memories was of a kicking bag shaped like a man inBruce’s garage. “Kick the guy,” Bruce urged. “Kick him in the head.”“Well, I don’t know,” Chuck demurred. “My pants are pretty tight.”Bruce kept at Chuck until he finally gave in. He threw a high kick and rippedhis pants all the way up the back. They fell down to his ankles. He reached downto pull them up as Linda walked in. “I had to go home hanging onto my pants,”Norris recalled. “I haven’t worn anything but double knit since then!”Bruce continued to give demonstrations and appear as the headliner at karatetournaments across the country. He became close friends with Jhoon Rhee andattended his Washington, D.C., championships every year. “In 1967, we had 8,000audience members, an unheard of number,” recalled Rhee. “Bruce really helped megather the crowds.” Rhee was so thankful for Bruce’s help over the years, heinvited Bruce to join him for an all-paid martial arts demonstration tour of theDominican Republic in February 1970.All of these free trips expanded Bruce’s horizons. And his high-profile privatestudents enhanced his reputation. But neither the tournament promoters nor thekarate champions were paying Bruce. His Chinatown school was, at best, abreak-even operation, and he was finding it difficult to land another lucrativeacting gig. He and his family had grown used to a certain lifestyle during theflush Green Hornet period, and now he was struggling to maintain it. Bruce Leedesperately needed another source of income."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f0216-01.jpg]Bruce Lee sipping a Presidente beer in the Dominican Republic, 1970.

(David Tadman)"},{"pageContent":"TWELVESIFU TO THE STARSThe popularity of Kato as a character allowed Bruce to supplement his incomewith paid appearances across the country. He was invited to perform at fairs,malls, and public parks. He appeared at store openings and rode on floats, oftenin Kato’s dark suit, chauffeur’s cap, and black mask. His asking price quicklyrose to $4,000 for an afternoon’s visit. But after The Green Hornet wascanceled, big-money invites for Kato slowly dried up.As opportunities to monetize Kato appeared to be ending, several businessmenapproached Bruce with an offer to open a nationwide franchise of “Kato KarateSchools.”  They would fund it, and he would add his name, prestige, andexpertise to the chain. It was his college career dream served on a silverplatter. Instead of spending years adding new schools one city at a time, hewould instantly have an empire.The hitch was it went against everything he had come to believe about themartial arts. Jeet Kune Do was supposed to be the physical expression of one’sindividuality in combat, not hamburgers to be homogenized for mass consumption.From the uniforms to the uniform curriculum, Bruce hated everything about KarateMcDojos. He only liked to teach small groups of highly talented and motivatedstudents—mostly so they could help him get better. He also knew from trying tobalance three schools in Los Angeles, Oakland, and Seattle how much time andeffort a nationwide chain would consume. It would effectively end his actingcareer and turn him into a corporate executive.And yet it was a lot of money—enough, perhaps, to secure him and his familyfinancially for life. He tortured over the decision before finally turning itdown. “I could have made a fortune,” he explained to friends. “But I didn’t wantto prostitute my art for the sake of money.” It was a huge gamble on Hollywood,made at a moment when his prospects didn’t look good. But Bruce had analternative strategy that fit with his personal philosophy and would alsoadvance his acting career. Instead of turning his art into a mass-marketcommodity for Kato-loving suburban teens, he would craft it into a boutiqueluxury item for celebrities.Jay Sebring, hairstylist to the stars, was the key to his plans. Seeing howSebring had fancied up a two-dollar haircut and sold it to the famous for fiftybucks, Bruce realized he could do the same with private kung fu lessons. Heasked Sebring to speak to his celebrity clients. An obscure Chinese actor didn’thave the juice to connect with Hollywood’s elite. He needed Sebring, whowhispered in their ears as he clipped their bangs, to vouch for him.As soon as Bruce and his family moved to Los Angeles in mid-March 1966, twomonths before filming started on The Green Hornet, he began giving Sebringprivate kung fu lessons. In return Sebring helped him put together a marketinglist. “I’ll be giving private lessons before the series starts,” Bruce wrote toone of his Oakland students. “The prospective students are so far Steve McQueen,Paul Newman, James Garner, and Vic Damone. The fee will be around $25 an hour[$190 in 2017 dollars].”Despite Sebring’s best efforts, there were no takers. Nobody in the movieindustry had ever heard of Bruce Lee or kung fu. As filming began on The GreenHornet, Bruce focused on the all-consuming task at hand and let the idea ofbecoming sifu to the stars slip to the backburner. Maybe Kato would be histicket to fame, fortune, and a fabulous film career. Once Dozier informed himthat “Green Hornet to buzz no more,” Bruce’s spirits collapsed. He realized heneeded to make some serious decisions, but he was uncertain what to do.One day he dropped by Dozier’s offices to seek advice about his stalled actingcareer. He ran into Charles Fitzsimons, the co-producer of The Green Hornet.“You finding any acting work?” Fitzsimons asked.“Nothing,” Bruce said, sitting down. “I’m worried.”“Why don’t you use your talent to teach celebrities kung fu?”“I tried to get some clients before The Green Hornet,” Bruce said. “But no onewas interested.”“How much were you asking?”“$25 an hour. Was that too much?”“It was too little,” Charles said. “You are Kato now. You’ve got a screencredit. You should be charging $50.”“Man, you are crazy!” Bruce exclaimed.“If you sell a hot dog for $2, nobody will think it is special, but if youcharge $8.50, people are going to think it must be the best hot dog in theworld, and they will buy it if they can afford it.”“Who will spend that kind of money on kung fu?”“Your potential clients are all the writers, actors, directors, and producers inthis town suffering from middle-aged, macho syndrome. Rich guys who want toappear tough and virile. They’ve got money to burn, and if you don’t take it,they’ll spend it learning karate from someone else.”“I don’t know,” Bruce said. “You really think they’d pay $50 an hour?”“You have to charge an outrageous figure, because that is the only thing thatwill impress them.”On February 29, 1968, Bruce went out and printed up new business cards: BruceLee, Jeet Kune Do, Professional Consultation and Instruction: $150 per Hour,Non-Professional Tuition: $500 for Ten Sessions. He handed Jay Sebring the cardsand asked him to repitch his clients. Within weeks, Kato from The Green Hornetlanded his first celebrity student, Vic Damone.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Vic Damone was a handsome Italian crooner in the mold of Frank Sinatra and DeanMartin. A big band singer, actor, and television presenter, Damone was bestknown for songs such as “On the Street Where You Live” from My Fair Lady and“You’re Breaking My Heart.” Like most other Italian boys from Brooklyn, Damonehad boxed a little in high school. Now everyone was talking about karate. ElvisPresley was high kicking onstage between songs. Sebring, who cut Damone’s hair,touted Bruce’s talents as a self-defense instructor, and Damone decided to givehim a try.Sebring and Bruce drove to Las Vegas to see Damone sing at the Sands. Damonebooked them a suite and comped their stay. In the afternoons all three of themworked out together on the Sands’s empty stage. As Bruce covered basictechniques, he explained his three-part strategy for combat. “If someoneconfronts you, first you stun him with a shot. Boom! Now, if he comes at youagain, then you cripple him by breaking his kneecaps. If he still continues,then you go for the throat and kill him. So you stun, you cripple, and then youkill.”Damone was intrigued with the simplicity and directness of Bruce’s approach. Hisboxing coaches had taught him to set up an opponent—jab, jab, feint, feint,jab—until he dropped his guard and then you could finally whack him one. “Butwith kung fu you don’t go through all of that,” Damone says. “You just go rightto the kill.”Of all the things Bruce taught Damone, the most useful were about relaxation.“You’ve got to relax,” Bruce would insist. “Once your body is relaxed, almostlike a limp rag, you can throw anything and you’ll be surprised how deadly itis. If you tighten up before you throw a punch, it will be weak. Keep your bodyloose and it’ll be like a whip.” Damone never had to stun, cripple, or killanybody, but Bruce’s relaxation techniques improved his singing. “Whenever I hada hard piece like ‘MacArthur Park,’ I would relax like Bruce taught me,” Damonesays. “The vocal cords would work and the voice would just flow out, just sobeautiful. Bruce helped me in a lot of ways. He really was a hell of awonderful, sweet guy.”The lessons continued on and off for about a year. Damone would come over toBruce’s house whenever he was in Los Angeles, and Bruce made a handful of tripsto Las Vegas. It was during one of those Vegas forays that Bruce Lee became alegend in his own lifetime.After finishing class, Bruce, Jay, and Vic decided to hit the Sands’ Chineserestaurant for dinner. As they were walking across the casino, they ran intoSammy Davis Jr.’s humongous bodyguard, Big John Hopkins. Damone and Big Johnbegan chatting about different things. Big John, who was smoking a cigarette,reached up to scratch his forehead with the cigarette still in his hand. All ofa sudden, Big John shot out his hand to wave hello to someone walking directlybehind Bruce. Quicker than Damone could blink, Bruce, who misinterpreted thewave as an attack, knocked the cigarette flying from Big John’s hand, kicked outone of his legs to knock him off balance, locked up both his arms at his sides,bent him backward until he was helpless, and went right at his throat with thepoints of his fingers.“Oh my God!” Damone shouted, stepping between them. “Whoa! Hey! Whoa! What areyou doing?”“What do you mean?” Bruce looked at Damone quizzically. “He was trying to hitme.”Now Big John, as big and tough as they come, became very gentle: “No, no, no, Iwasn’t gonna hit you. I was waving at somebody behind you.”“Oh, okay,” said Bruce, letting Big John free. “I’m sorry.”As Big John was regaining his composure, he said, “Jesus Christ, who the fuckare you?”“This is Bruce Lee,” Damone said. “This is Jay Sebring.”“I’m so sorry,” Big John said, before pausing to reflect. “What the hell did youdo to me? Because all the sudden I’m standing here and I’m helpless.”To smooth things over, Damone patted Big John on the shoulder and invited him tojoin them for dinner. During the meal, Big John peppered Bruce with so manyfawning questions about Jeet Kune Do that Damone finally leaned over to Sebringand whispered, “I’ve never seen John kiss ass like this.”It was a great story and Damone loved telling it to all his friends, who lovedtelling it to all their friends. Like a game of telephone the story grew witheach retelling until it became mythological.In the later versions of the tale, it was Frank Sinatra who invited Bruce Lee toLas Vegas to learn more about kung fu. When Bruce arrived in town, he wasbrought up to Sinatra’s suite by Vic Damone. Sinatra had become very interestedin the martial arts because of The Manchurian Candidate (1962), but he thought alot of the mystique was exaggerated. A good tough American street fighter, heinsisted, could always beat an Oriental karate man, because Asians were smallerand thinner. Bruce politely disagreed. “Well, how can we test this?” Frankasked. “I mean without anybody getting hurt.” Bruce looked at Sinatra’s twomassive bodyguards and said, “Why don’t we put one bodyguard by the door, andthe other across the room smoking a cigarette. Let’s see if they can stop mefrom kicking it out of his mouth. Would this be an acceptable test of what themartial arts can do?” Sinatra nodded, excited. After Bruce left the room,Sinatra told his bodyguards, “Look, I don’t want you to hurt him, cause he’ssmall and Chinese, but I wouldn’t mind if either one of you knock him on hisass. Give him a good shot. Let’s settle this once and for all.” Everyone waswaiting, and then BLAM! The door not only flew open, the damn thing came off thehinges, blasting the first bodyguard out of the way. Hurtling across the room,Bruce high kicked the cigarette out of the second bodyguard’s mouth and sent itwhistling past Sinatra’s face. “What do you think now?” Bruce asked. “Holyshit!” Sinatra exclaimed.The fact that this story bore little resemblance to the truth, or evenplausibility, didn’t seem to matter. Nobody fact-checked it with Sinatra orDamone. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend. This tall tale madeBruce Lee the most sought after martial arts instructor in Hollywood.Image [../images/sec.jpg]“Whether that story was true or not, I didn’t know,” recalls Oscar-winningscreenwriter Stirling Silliphant. “But that was the story I heard at a Hollywoodparty. It was circulating all over Hollywood at the time. And it was good enoughfor me. I decided Bruce was going to be my man.”Stirling Silliphant was the Aaron Sorkin of his day, as successful in TV as inmovies. He had just been nominated for an Academy Award for In the Heat of theNight (1967). A fencer in college, he was, at the age of fifty, suffering frommiddle-age, macho syndrome. For weeks he tried to track down Bruce Lee withoutsuccess, until he stopped by Sebring’s for his monthly haircut.On March 18, 1968, Silliphant called Bruce and said, “I am Stirling Silliphant.I have been looking for you for weeks. I would like to study with you.”“I don’t really teach. I have one or two students only,” Bruce said, playinghard to get.“Can we meet to discuss it?” Silliphant anxiously asked. “I really want to studywith you. So does my friend, Joe Hyams. Do you know him? He’s the most importantcolumnist in town. Writes for The Saturday Evening Post. Married to Elke Sommer.Just published a best-selling biography of Humphrey Bogart. We want to buy theten-lesson package.”“Where do you want to meet?” Bruce asked, still noncommittal.“Columbia Pictures,” Silliphant said, hoping this would convince the young actorto accept him as a student.“I’m free for lunch on March 20.”When they met, Bruce took one look at Silliphant, fifty, and Hyams, forty-four,and said, “Forget it. You’ve never studied the martial arts before. You’re tooold to start.”Silliphant was taken aback. As an A-list writer-producer, who hired lots ofactors, he assumed Bruce would jump at the chance to have him as a pupil. But ifanything, the initial rebuff just made Silliphant more eager. “You don’t knowanything about me,” he huffed. “At USC I had the fastest reflexes of anyone evertested. I have incredible eyesight. Tests show I have a highly competitiveattitude. I’m a winner. I was three years varsity fencing at USC and we won thePacific Coast championship. All you have to do is teach me to apply my attitude.Instead of sword hitting, it’ll be my body hitting.”“You were a fencer?” Bruce smiled, raising an eyebrow. “Show me.”Silliphant lunged back and forth with a steak knife as his sword. After aminute, he asked, “What do you think?”Bruce leaned back, appearing to consider: “You are too old, but your stance withjust a slight alteration is almost like Jeet Kune Do. After watching yourmovements, I think I can teach you.”Bruce turned to look at Joe Hyams: “Why do you want to study with me?”“Because I saw your demonstration at Ed Parker’s Championships and was impressedwith your demonstration, and because I heard you are the best.”“You’ve studied other martial arts?”“For a long time,” Hyams answered. “I served in the South Pacific during WorldWar II. I started studying martial arts to stop guys from beating me up forbeing Jewish. But I stopped some time ago and now I want to begin again.”“Would you demonstrate some of your techniques?”Hyams jumped up for his audition and ran through several katas, or forms, fromother disciplines.“Do you realize you will have to unlearn all you have learned and start overagain?” Bruce asked.“No,” Hyams said, crestfallen.Bruce smiled, placed his hand on Hyams’s shoulder, and said: “Let me tell you astory my sifu taught me. A professor once went to a Zen master to inquire aboutZen. As the Zen master explained, the professor would frequently interrupt hisremarks, ‘Oh yes, we have that too . . .’ and so on. Finally the Zen masterstopped talking and began to serve tea to the professor. He poured the cup fulland then kept pouring until the cup overflowed. ‘Enough,’ the professor oncemore interrupted. ‘No more can go into the cup!’ ‘Indeed,’ answered the Zenmaster. ‘If you do not first empty your cup, how can you taste my tea?’ ”Bruce studied Hyams’s face. “You understand the point?”“Yes,” he said. “You want me to empty my mind of past knowledge and old habitsso that I will be open to new learning.”“Yes,” Bruce said, and then addressed Hyams and Silliphant. “I think I can teachyou both.”Hyams and Silliphant started their twice-a-week lessons on March 25 at Hyams’shouse. Bruce focused on the basics but quickly had them sparring each other. “Itwas probably a ridiculous sight: two middle-aged men wearing headgear and boxinggloves pummeling each other in the driveway of a suburban home,” Hyams recalls.Bruce, acting as umpire-coach, would observe and critique: “Focus! Relax!”Hyams’s favorite times were the conversations after class in his backyard over aglass of fruit juice. “These few moments were precious to me,” Hyams says,“because, invariably, I gained insight into one or both of my friends.”Hyams took seventeen lessons over two months before quitting. Silliphantcontinued to train privately with Bruce for the next three years. “It was a veryrewarding and beautiful time,” Silliphant recalls. “It really began to open meup in terms of martial arts and physical contact.” Silliphant was enthralledwith Bruce—a man crush. “I owe my spirituality to Bruce Lee,” Silliphant says.“In my lifetime, I never met another man who was even remotely at his level ofconsciousness. Because of Bruce, I opened all my windows.”Early in their training, Bruce criticized Silliphant for being too timid: “Yourdefenses are good, but your offense is weak. Your attacks lack emotionalcontent.”“When I fenced in college, I scored 90 percent of my touches viacounterattacks,” Stirling said. “I prefer to react.”“Bullshit,” Bruce replied. “That’s a technical rationalization. There’ssomething in you, something deep in your mind that stops you from attacking. Youhave to rationalize that the other guy is attacking you, so then it’s okay toknock him off. But you don’t have the killer instinct; you’re not pursuing him.Why?”Silliphant thought about this for weeks and weeks. Finally, he said to Bruce,“My father, a pure Anglo, never once in his life held me in his arms or kissedme. In fact, I’ve never in my life touched a man or had any body contact withanother male. I’m not homophobic or anything, but, ah, I just, um, haven’t everdone it.”The two men had been working out all afternoon. They were sweating and had theirshirts off, wearing black Chinese pajama pants only.Bruce stepped toward Silliphant and said, “Put your arms around me.”“Hey, Bruce,” Silliphant protested, “you’re all sweaty, man.”“Do it!” he demanded.So Silliphant put his arms around his sifu.“Pull me closer,” Bruce said.“Jesus, Bruce!”“Closer!”Silliphant could feel Bruce’s vibrant life force. He felt good and alive, and itwas as if a steel wall between them had been blown away. When Silliphant openedhis arms, Bruce stepped back, studying him.“You have to love everyone,” Bruce said, “not only women, but men as well. Youdon’t have to have sex with a man, but you have to be able to relate to hisseparate physicality. If you don’t, you will never be able to fight him, todrive your fist through his chest, to snap his neck, to gouge out his eyes.”When Bruce was a teenager at La Salle, he recruited a gang from his fellowclassmates. In Seattle, he had a formed a crew out of his kung fu students. InHollywood, he repeated the same pattern. Stirling Silliphant became Bruce’s mostimportant patron and cheerleader—the man who would do the most to advance hiscareer.Image [../images/sec.jpg]James Coburn—along with Steve McQueen and Charles Bronson—was one of thetough-guy action stars of the era. He appeared in supporting roles in movieslike The Magnificent Seven (1960) and The Great Escape (1963) until the JamesBond parody film Our Man Flint (1966) made Coburn a star. To prepare for therole of Flint, he began studying karate.Aware of Coburn’s growing fascination with the Asian arts, Stirling Silliphantcalled him to tout his new master: “Look, I’ve met a young Chinese boy who’sreally sensational—he’s got the magic kick; he’s got the magic!” After severalweeks, Silliphant finally had the chance to introduce Bruce to Coburn at aHollywood party. It was a small but impressive gathering with just about everyguest a major player in the movie industry. With Bruce present, the topic ofconversation quickly turned to the martial arts.“I had a few lessons while making the Flint series,” Coburn said to Bruce. “Whatdo you think of that instructor the producer used?”“I know who you’re referring to,” Bruce hesitated, before answering. “Let me putit this way. If I were to classify all the instructors in the country, I’d haveto place him pretty far down the bottom.”“You should show James your famous one-inch punch,” Silliphant said,mischievously.“Sure,” grinned Bruce. “Stand up.”Bruce positioned Coburn several feet in front of a chair and asked him to hold aseat cushion against his chest for protection. Coburn was so tall Bruce decidedto add an extra inch to the punch. As soon as Bruce blasted him, Coburn wentflying back, sprawled into the chair, toppled it over, and rolled into thecorner of the room. The shock on Coburn’s face as he wobbled to his feet was socomplete the room burst into laughter.It took a few seconds for Coburn to regain his composure and realize what hadhappened. Suddenly, his face lit up and he blurted out: “Let’s go! Let’s go towork.”“Anytime,” Bruce replied. “But I want to let you know that it’s not cheap.”“I don’t care. I want to start right away. How about tomorrow?”“Sure,” Bruce nodded. “I can start you off even if it’s a Sunday.”On November 1, 1968, Bruce went to Coburn’s mansion for their first lesson. Itlooked like a museum. Coburn collected Asian antiques—vases, statues, andpaintings from India, Japan, and China. They worked on the basics: a few punchesand kicks to assess Coburn’s level. The next week Coburn came to Bruce’s houseand they started in earnest: twice a week for the next six months.“Bruce always had this energy,” Coburn recalls. “It was always exploding on him.We’d work out together for an hour and a half and at the end of that time, he’dbe filled with force. You really felt high when you finished working out withBruce.” Coburn enjoyed the physical aspect but he was more interested in theesoteric side of the martial arts. After working out, they would hang out andtalk about philosophy, psychology, and mysticism.“We’d do a thing Bruce called ‘bridging the gap,’ ” Coburn says. “It’s thedistance from your opponent you have to stand in order to score—it’s how closeyou can get in and move away fast enough not to get hit in return. It amounts toconstant observation of your opponent and constant observation of yourself, sothat you and your opponent are one—not divided. And while you were picking upthis physical bridging of the gap, you were learning to overcome certainpsychological barriers at the same time.”Coburn was so enthusiastic he converted one of the rooms in his mansion into agym to match Bruce’s. As the months went by, the two seemed inseparable. Coburnbecame Bruce’s most dedicated Hollywood student, taking 106 private lessons withhim over a three-year period.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Steve McQueen and Jay Sebring were best friends—two straightforward,street-smart, self-made men. For 1960s Hollywood, they embodied the ideal ofmasculinity: cool, tough, and dangerous with just a hint of vulnerability. WhenSebring bragged that Bruce Lee was the best fight instructor he had ever met,McQueen was, at the age of thirty-seven, eager to meet him. Their first trainingsession took place at McQueen’s mansion, nicknamed the Castle, on August 25,1967.Bruce was impressed with McQueen’s determination and resilience. “That guydoesn’t know the meaning of quitting,” Bruce told a friend. “He just keepspushing himself for hours—punching and kicking for hours without a break—untilhe is completely exhausted.” During one class, they were training in McQueen’sbig courtyard paved with rough sandstone rock, and Steve tripped and cut openhis big toe. It was a bloody mess with a big piece of flesh dangling.“We’d better stop,” Bruce suggested“No,” McQueen responded. “Let’s keep on training.”Over the first year, the private lessons were sporadic. McQueen was the biggestbox office star in Hollywood and frequently out of town. “Steve would be damnedgood if he could work out more, but the sonovagun never stays home,” Bruce said.“If he’s shooting, he’ll be stuck at a location for as long as five months,returning for a couple of days in between. If he’s not working, he’ll besomewhere in the desert, driving his dune buggy or motorcycle.”Even more than Steve’s busy schedule, the biggest difficulty Bruce faced asMcQueen’s teacher was gaining his trust. “When I first saw him, I couldn’tunderstand that guy,” Bruce told a friend. “He was so suspicious of me.” McQueencame from a broken home. His father abandoned the family before Steve was sixmonths old. His alcoholic mother cycled through abusive boyfriends. She sentSteve away first to family members and then later, when he became a rebelliousteenager, to reform schools.Over time Bruce and Steve slowly became friends. “They really connected,” saysLinda, “because they were the same kind of guy, rough and tumble coming fromsimilar backgrounds.” Both had a parent who was an addict; both were smart buthad done poorly in school; both were teenage troublemakers who roamed thestreets in gangs. “If I hadn’t found acting,” McQueen later admitted to areporter, “I would have wound up a hood.”  They were angry, aggressive,hypercompetitive alpha males—Lee of the charming, showboating variety, andMcQueen the hard, isolate, stoic type. “It took quite a while before I got toknow him,” Bruce said of McQueen. “But once he accepted me as a friend, webecame real close.”“Sometimes I’d feel rotten and the phone would ring, and it would be Bruce,”McQueen recalled. “I don’t know why he called. He would just say, ‘I justthought I should call you.’ ”Steve McQueen became like an older brother to Bruce in Hollywood. Theirrelationship was a mixture of mutual admiration and mutual envy. McQueen longedto possess Bruce’s fighting prowess, while Lee wanted to be as big a star asMcQueen. More than anyone else in Tinseltown, McQueen served as Bruce Lee’s rolemodel. From Steve he learned that the star, not the director as in China, isdominant. McQueen replaced directors he didn’t respect and chewed throughproducers. He bent everyone on-set to his will. And he cut a wide swath throughthe female population of actresses, groupies, production assistants, makeupartists, housewives, hitchhikers, waitresses, and hatcheck girls.As Bruce’s career counselor, McQueen told him not to worry about acting lessonsor joining one of the drama playhouses: “You will develop your own acting styleover time. The most important thing is to meet the right people in the industryand impress them.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]Bruce had difficulty networking because he disliked Hollywood parties. As arelatively obscure TV actor and the only Asian guest, he frequently felt like alowly outsider. “Bruce and I went along to one or two during his lean period,partly because one never knew what opportunities might suddenly presentthemselves,” Linda Lee says. “The trouble with film parties is that the starswant to be at the center of things and Bruce was too much his own man, tooconscious of his own worth, to join in the fawning, adulatory chorus that tendsto surround the Big Name. And Bruce, on first meeting, was always so polite andcourteous that I think most of them got the impression that he was simply thereto take away the dishes.”When he became fed up with being ignored or treated like a Chinese busboy, Brucewould grab the spotlight by giving a performance. “Inevitably, at some timeduring the evening, when I turned round and looked for Bruce, he would be in thecenter of a group, doing push-ups or performing his coin trick or holding thefloor on philosophy or the martial arts,” Linda recalls. “I used to marvel atthe look of amazement on everyone’s faces. They simply weren’t ready for Bruce.”Another reason why Hollywood partygoers often mistook Bruce for the help was hedidn’t smoke cigarettes and rarely touched alcohol. “I’m not that type of cat,”Bruce told Fighting Stars magazine. As drunken revelers puffed away and downedcocktails, he remained dead sober with a cup of tea in his hands. It led many tobelieve he was a teetotaler—a myth that continues to this day. In fact, he didoccasionally partake, he just didn’t imbibe very often or very much. Alcoholdidn’t sit well with him.“I tried twenty times to get him to drink,” says Bob Wall, who costarred inEnter the Dragon. “One time I got him to sip wine. He spit it out. It wasn’t histhing.” Andre Morgan, who worked with Bruce in Hong Kong, confirms this: “Brucewas not a drinker. He drank a little Shaoxing wine at dinner, but he wasn’thitting the bottle like people in Hollywood hit the bottle.” Joe Lewis adds thisstory: “There was this time in about 1969 that Bruce was at the house and mywife fixed him a drink—some kind of sweet, syrupy thing. And Bruce drank it andthen he got unbelievably sick. He turned red, he was sweating, sweat was runningall down his face. And we helped him to the bathroom. He threw up and threw upand threw up still more.”Based on these anecdotes, it seems likely that Bruce Lee suffered from alcoholflush reaction. It is more colloquially known as the Asian Glow, because over 35percent of East Asians suffer from it. Affected persons lack an enzyme needed tometabolize alcohol. After one or two drinks, they turn red in the face, startsweating, and feel nauseated.Finding himself in the foreign land of late-1960s hard-partying Hollywood, Bruceneeded to adapt. Because boozing with the boys was a nonstarter, he had to finda different way to fit in. Fortunately, there was another social drug becomingpopular at that time that Bruce’s body could metabolize and his brain couldenjoy.Image [../images/sec.jpg]When rising screen idol Robert Mitchum was arrested in 1948 at what FederalBureau of Narcotics agents alleged was a marijuana smoking party, he gave hisoccupation as former actor. He believed his movie career was finished. Facingthe press, he said, “I guess it’s all over now. I’m ruined. This is the bitterend.” He was right to be pessimistic. For decades, the American government hadbeen vilifying cannabis as a gateway drug and racially stigmatizing itsassociation to Mexican laborers and black jazz musicians. Even Hollywood, along-standing bastion for stoners, had supported the propaganda with ReeferMadness (1936) and The Devil’s Weed (1949).But Mitchum’s conviction proved a boon to his career, casting him as a rebelboth on-screen and in real life. On the other coast, the Beats, a group ofmostly white intellectuals and writers who frequented the jazz clubs of New YorkCity, began to evangelize marijuana as a device to enhance literary visions,most famously in Allen Ginsberg’s Howl and Other Poems (1956) and Jack Kerouac’sOn the Road (1957). Ginsberg wrote in the November 1966 issue of AtlanticMonthly, “Marijuana is a useful catalyst for specific optical and auralaesthetic perceptions.”  The Beat prophets led to the Beatnik proselytizers,which led to the counterculture hippies. By the mid- to late 1960s, marijuanahad become pervasive, especially in Hollywood.It was Steve McQueen who turned Bruce Lee on to marijuana. It quickly became hisdrug of choice—Puff the Magic Dragon. After a training session with one of hiscelebrity clients, Bruce would light a blunt and talk philosophy. “He’d want toget high and have a ball, listen to music,” James Coburn recalls. “Blowing Goldwas one of his favorite things.” Herb Jackson, one of Bruce’s senior students,says that Bruce kept a box of marijuana cigarettes in his garage.“It was different and scary,” Bruce said of his first experience getting stoned.“I was feeling pretty high when Steve gave me a cup of hot tea. As I placed thecup to my lips, it felt like a river gushing into my mouth. It was weird.Everything was so exaggerated. Even the damn noise from my slurping was so loudit sounded like splashing waves. When I got into my car and started to go, thestreet seemed like it was moving real fast toward me. The white centerline justflew at me and so did the telephone poles. You just notice everything moresharply. You become aware of everything. To me, it was artificial awareness.But, you know, this is what we’re trying to reach in martial arts, the‘awareness,’ but in a more natural way. Better get it through martial arts, it’smore permanent. It doesn’t make sense to be on pot all the time.”Joe Lewis recalls an anecdote that shows how marijuana helped Bruce socialize inthis new environment: “Hell, back in Hollywood, I saw Bruce doing dope right infront of me. One time, he walked into my place and started passing out thesehuge joints the size of big cigars. I said, ‘Bruce, that’s not the way you doit. You just roll one little one and pass it around.’ He tells me, ‘No need toshare. I want everyone to have their own.’ And he thumps his chest like he didin the movies, real big and proud. Everybody thought that was funny. That wasBruce, all right. Bruce to a T. But it’s not like anybody thought that anythingwas wrong with all that. It was the sixties and seventies. We thought it wasinnocent. Everybody was doing drugs.”Everybody in the movie industry might have been doing drugs, but most martialartists—largely ex-servicemen—were not. To them, real men got drunk, not high.“Judo” Gene LeBell remembers going over to Bruce’s house for a lesson andbecoming upset at all the pot smoke. “I never went back to his house,” he says,still angry fifty years later. When the topic of marijuana use was raised withDan Inosanto, he looked down at his hands, shook his head, and sighed, “Brucesaid, ‘It raises the consciousness level.’ ” But ever the loyal disciple he feltthe need to add, “I don’t think Bruce was as much a user as people make it outto be.”Beyond its consciousness-raising appeal, Bruce’s fondness for cannabis—at firsthe used marijuana and then later switched to hash—may have involved an elementof self-medication. “Never Sits Still” had been hyperactive and impulsive sincehis childhood. Marijuana and hash seem to have served as a kind of chill pill.Bob Wall remembers working out with Bruce Lee at his Kowloon Tong home in HongKong in 1972. “He was funnier than hell because the minute we were done he wouldhave a hash brownie,” he says. “We’d be philosophizing and talking away. He’dfinish it. Immediately, I could almost see him chewing his fingers off, right?Then he’d go for another one. Because he couldn’t sit, he’d be out the door. Hewas just fucking hyper like a motherfucker. But after two brownies, he wasmellow. He became a normal human.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]By the end of 1968, Bruce was the hottest self-defense instructor in Hollywood.He was so overwhelmed with requests he printed up new business cards: BruceLee’s Jeet Kune Do, Professional Consultation and Instruction: $275 per hour,Ten Session Course: $1,000, Instruction Overseas: $1,000 per week plus expenses.“I used to charge $500 for a ten hour course, and people flocked,” Bruce latertold a reporter. “I even doubled the prices and people still kept coming. I hadno idea so many people were interested in Chinese boxing. It was a veryprofitable thing to do.”To his core of Stirling Silliphant, James Coburn, and Steve McQueen, Bruce addedtwo top directors, Blake Edwards (Breakfast at Tiffany’s, The Pink Panther) andRoman Polanski (Rosemary’s Baby, Chinatown), a successful TV producer, SyWeintraub (Tarzan), and a casino magnate, Beldon Katleman. As these A-listerspadded his bank account, they also offered him a glimpse into the lifestyles ofthe rich and famous. “The first time I went to Katleman’s place, I was greetedby his butler who had a heavy British accent and dressed exactly like Britishbutlers in the movies,” Bruce recalled. “He took me through the huge mansion tothe backyard with a full-sized tennis court and an Olympic-sized pool. It wasthe biggest damn backyard I’ve ever seen. I never knew anyone could be thatrich.”When Steve McQueen was just starting out he had a chance to hang out with FrankSinatra and saw the private jets, limousines, red carpet events, screaming fans,opened doors, and fawning admiration. “I want some of that,” McQueen whisperedto his wife. Now it was Bruce’s turn to feel the same way.What Lee wanted more than anything was a new sports car. He neglected his oldChevy Nova, hardly ever cleaning it. The only thing he liked about the junkerwas the sticker on the back window with the inscription: “This Car Is ProtectedBy The Green Hornet.” “Only a few hundred were printed,” he proudly said. “Itried to get more but even I couldn’t get any.”Jay Sebring would let Bruce race his Shelby Cobra along Mulholland Drive—thetwisty two-lane road along the ridgeline of the Santa Monica Mountains. “I don’tknow how fast,” Linda laughs, “but I didn’t want to know.” Bruce admired theCobra, but what he really desired was a Porsche 911S Targa, because McQueen hadone. On August 26, 1968, he visited Bob Smith’s Volkswagen-Porsche dealership inHollywood for a test drive. As soon as he got home, he called up McQueen in PalmSprings.“Steve, I’m going to get a Porsche like yours,” Bruce declared.“Look, Bruce, let me take you for a ride in mine when I get back,” Steve saidwith a note of caution in his voice. “It’s a really hot car, but if you don’tknow what you are doing you can get into a lot of trouble with this thing.”“Okay,” Bruce excitedly said.McQueen was a world-class driver—he could have made his living as a Grand Prixdriver—while Bruce was by all accounts a menace behind the wheel. (“He was justway too fast for me,” says Dan Inosanto. “It would scare me.”) Bruce wasexpecting a joy ride, but McQueen hoped to frighten Bruce out of buying aPorsche. Steve picked up Bruce and drove up the San Fernando Valley toMulholland Drive.“Okay, Bruce, you ready?” Steve said, focused intently on the road.“Yes, I’m all set. Let’s go!”Steve peeled away, grinding through the gears as he twisted and turned along thewinding, dangerous path high in the mountains.“What do you think of this power, Bruce?” Steve shouted over the roar of theengine.Bruce said nothing.“Now watch this!” Steve yelled as he slalomed from the side of the mountain tothe edge of the precipice. “Isn’t that great, Bruce? See how it handles. Nowwatch how I slide it!” Steve put the Porsche into a tail slide as he went rightto the edge. “Isn’t that great, Bruce?”No reply.“Now watch this, Bruce. Sucker will do a mean 180,” Steve announced as he gearedit up, spun it around, and finally stopped the car. He looked over and said,“Well, what do you think, Bruce?” But Bruce wasn’t in the passenger seat. Stevelooked down and saw Bruce huddled in the deep footwell with his hands over hishead. “Bruce?”“McQueen you sonovabitch!” Bruce shouted as he pulled himself back into theseat. “McQueen, I bloody kill you! I kill you, McQueen! I gunna kill you!”Steve saw the look of rage on Bruce’s face and it terrified him. He knew howdeadly Bruce could be when he was angry. So Steve put the pedal to the metal andraced back up Mulholland Drive as fast as he could.“Bruce, calm down!” Steve shouted.“Steve, slow down,” Bruce cried out. “Slow down!”“You won’t hit me will you, Bruce?” Steve pleaded.“No, no.”“You won’t touch me, will you?”“No, no.”“You won’t hurt me will you?”“No, no! Just stop the car. Stop the car!”Steve finally pulled over to the side, and Bruce said, “I will never drive withyou again, McQueen. Never!”Afterward Bruce told a friend: “If you think I’m a fast driver, you should ridewith Steve. One afternoon while coming down Mulholland, he must have thought wewere on a racetrack because he was going at least 60 around the curves. You knowI don’t usually get scared that easy, but Steve sure made me shit that time. Ikept praying that he doesn’t hit a stone or there’ll be no tomorrow.”It wasn’t the terror ride that scared off Bruce from immediately buying aPorsche, but rather Linda telling him she was pregnant again. A second childmeant more practical concerns. Linda and Bruce decided they needed to upgradetheir family’s living situation. On August 27, 1968, Bruce went over toMcQueen’s Castle to ask for advice. He had never bought a home before. McQueenoffered to have his business manager help Bruce and Linda with the search.With his income from private lessons and residuals from The Green Hornet, Bruceand Linda approached a realtor about finding a nice house in the mid-$20,000range. “We didn’t know much about the housing market in Southern California,”Linda says. “I was not prepared for the kind of location or property for thatsum of money. Eventually, we realized we would have to upgrade our housingbudget.”Their realtor highly recommended a house at 2551 Roscomare Road in the upscaleneighborhood of Bel Air. Initially, Bruce and Linda were uncertain. The1,902-square-foot, three-bedroom, two-bath ranch home, built in 1951, needed alot of work. It also cost $47,000, which was way over their budget. But Bruceadored the exclusivity of Bel Air, and McQueen’s business manager told them itwas a steal: “With the tax refund it is better to own in Bel Air than rent inCulver City.” When Bruce called Steve for his opinion, McQueen offered to coverthe $10,000 down payment. “Boy, that was a lot of money, and he was just gonnagive it to me with no strings attached,” Bruce later said. “I had to turn himdown because I’d feel obligated. But it was nice of him and I sure appreciatedit. That Steve is too much.”They applied for a home loan on September 9, and it was approved on September13, 1968. “With the mortgage payments, property taxes, and insurance, we were inway over our heads,” Linda says. “It doesn’t matter if you can deduct money fromyour taxes in April, if you can’t make your mortgage payments in October.”Bruce’s students from his Chinatown school helped him move on September 28 and29. He had trouble sleeping the first few nights. “It was so quiet that I couldhear a pin drop,” Bruce said. “I heard strange noises in my backyard and on myroof. The next morning I saw animal tracks. I didn’t know they came from wildanimals until my neighbor told me. It’s kinda funny, all these years I lived inL.A. and never dreamt that wild animals roamed so close.” Bruce quickly fell inlove with his new home’s location: “This place is terrific. I’m away from theheavy city traffic and still can get to any place in Los Angeles quickly.Sometimes, I just sit in my backyard and gaze at the ocean watching the sunslowly set. Civilization seems so far away.”Just as in Culver City, Bruce converted his Bel Air home into a martial artstraining center. On the patio, under the eaves of the house, he hung huge redkicking backs, a top and bottom bag, a square hitting pad strung by elasticcords, a squat machine, a leg-stretching device, a variety of weights andassorted kicking and striking pads. He filled the garage with so much trainingequipment that he had to park his Chevy Nova on the street. Once everything wasset up, he held private lessons at his Bel Air home with his senior Chinatownstudents and his Hollywood clients. All the activity raised some eyebrows in thefancy neighborhood. Brandon, who was four years old, made friends with a boy onthe next block named Luke. He frequently invited Brandon over to his home butrefused to visit Brandon’s. When Linda asked Luke’s mother why, she confessedthat Luke was afraid of all the strange equipment and the people yelling andhitting each other.One of the attractions of the house for Bruce was its close proximity toMulholland Drive. (“Good for the guys,” Linda says, “but bad for children.”) Ifanything, the ride with McQueen had increased Bruce’s desire for a Porsche. Themore Bruce stared at his dilapidated Chevy Nova with its faded paint job infront of his brand-new home in his fancy Bel Air neighborhood the moreembarrassed he became of the eyesore. But he was already overextended with thehouse. Then out of the blue, Bruce received a windfall. His mother sold one ofthe apartments in Hong Kong that his father had bought after the war. Bruce’sshare of the profits was $7,000. It just so happened that a 1968 Porsche 911STarga cost $6,990. It was like fate, a sign from Heaven. On December 7, 1968,barely two months after moving into a house he couldn’t afford, Bruce bought ared 911 Porsche from Bob Smith.He immediately raced over to Chuck Norris’s karate school in Sherman Oaks. Hescreeched into the parking lot, locked the brakes, and slid into the curb.Inside the school, Norris, his business partner, Bob Wall, and his chiefinstructor, Pat Johnson, heard this awful crashing noise and ran outsideexpecting to find an accident. Instead, they saw a brand-new Porsche sitting ata cockeyed angle on the curb and Bruce Lee standing next to it with his armsfolded across his chest just looking it over as proud as he could be.“Guys, check out my new car,” Bruce said.“Bruce, it’s beautiful,” Norris said, “but we thought something had happened.”“Nah, nah, it’s fine. Chuck, come along, I’m going to take you for a ride in myPorsche.”Norris froze in terror: “Ah, Bruce, I’ve got to run back to my other school.I’ve got lessons to teach. See you later, but remember you owe me a ride.”“Pat, jump into the car.”“Well, my classes are about to start,” Pat Johnson hedged. “Another time, okay?”“Bob, come on.”“Bruce, I have an appointment,” Bob Wall lied. “I’m gonna sell somebody alesson.”“Okay, next time,” Bruce said, so delighted with his new car he didn’t realizethey didn’t want to ride with him. “I’ll see if Lewis is home.”“Great, Bruce, great,” they said, as Bruce jumped into his Porsche and peeledaway.The purchase of the Porsche stretched the family’s financial situation to itslimits, but Bruce felt compelled to show McQueen he was his equal. “It wasextravagant,” Linda admits, “when we were hardly making mortgage payments. Itwas an extravagance, but it made Bruce happy.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]The arrival on Saturday, April 19, 1969, of a healthy baby girl made Bruce evenhappier. Shannon Emery Lee was born at Santa Monica Hospital. “The second time Ihad decided it was going to be a girl,” Bruce told everyone, “so we only chose agirl’s name.” Bruce wrote down in his daytime planner Shannon’s weight andlength—six pounds, six ounces, and nineteen inches. Shannon quickly had herdoting father wrapped around her little finger. His friends noted a change inattitude. He became more attentive.One day when he visited the Black Belt offices looking depressed, Mito Uyeharaasked, “What’s wrong, Bruce?”“I feel real bad today,” Bruce confided. “I was clipping my daughter’s nails andaccidentally cut her finger. When she started to scream and I saw the blooddripping, I went crazy. I didn’t know what to do. Lucky that Linda was around.Man, I felt really bad. She’s so tiny and I had to hurt her.”On May 30, 1969, Grace Ho arrived at Los Angeles International Airport to seeher newest grandchild. She traveled with Robert, who was entering college in thefall. From the other side of the terminal, Bruce spotted his younger brother andcharged over to greet him. After they embraced, Bruce took a step back to lookRobert up and down.“Jesus, you’re skinny!” Bruce bellowed. “Don’t tell anyone you’re mybrother—you’ll embarrass me!”“Don’t tease him,” Grace interjected.“How much do you weigh?”“108.”“108 pounds? No good! I need to train you.”While Bruce was away, Robert had become one of Hong Kong’s biggest teensensations with his boy band, the Thunderbirds. They made a couple of top 10 hitsingles for EMI, the most popular of which was “Baby Baby, You Put Me Down.”Anders Nelsson, who fronted a rival band, says, “He was like the David Cassidyof Hong Kong. Pretty boy, pretty boy.” When the rumors that he was leaving forcollege in America proved true, his lovelorn female admirers were distraught.Robert told The China Mail, “I hope my fans will understand I have to thinkabout my future.”Robert was more famous than Bruce had ever been as a child actor, but as theyoungest sibling he still had to obey his elders. The day after his arrivalRobert was roused out of bed by his big brother, who handed him a pair of tennisshoes. “We are going for a three-mile run,” Bruce said.Robert lasted for less than a mile before dropping away. He staggered back toBruce’s Bel Air home and threw up, his face completely white. For the next twoweeks, Bruce put Robert through his boot camp. He made him eat his special egg,peanut butter, and banana protein shakes three times a day. He had him liftingdumbbells every day. Robert’s weight jumped from 108 to 124 pounds, but Brucerealized there was little hope of turning his little brother, the sweet-singinglover, into a street fighter.“Since you have no talent for the martial arts and no strength to beat anybodyup,” Bruce finally said, “there’s only one skill I want to teach you: how to runaway.”Robert was annoyed but couldn’t help but burst out laughing.Grace and Robert stayed until the end of the summer. In their eyes, Bruce musthave seemed a great success. To all outward appearances, Bruce Lee was the modelimmigrant—a homeowner in Bel Air with a Porsche, two cute kids, and a lovelyCaucasian wife. That it was all built on a mountain of debt and teetering on thebrink of collapse made Bruce’s story a prototypically American one. “It was avery difficult time for us,” Linda says. The arrival of Shannon made Bruceunbelievably happy and extremely anxious. “I have to be more concerned for myfamily now,” Bruce admitted to a friend. “First time in my life I am worriedabout where the money will come from if anything happens to me.”"},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f0240-01.jpg]Sharon Tate and Bruce on the set of The Wrecking Crew, summer 1968.

(BerndLubowski/ullstein bild/Getty Images)"},{"pageContent":"THIRTEENBIT PLAYERThe cancellation of The Green Hornet dropped Bruce from a salaried player on aregular series down to a fringe actor, a freelancer—sustaining himself on bitparts, dreaming of the big one just around the corner. Unlike his whitecolleagues, who could show up any day of the week to play Ambulance Driver orRanch Hand or Criminal Suspect #3, Bruce often had to wait months to compete forthe handful of roles in any given year written specifically for an Asian actor.After six months without any serious prospects, Bruce landed his first post-Katopart in Ironside, a lukewarm police procedural starring Raymond Burr as awheelchair-bound detective. In the episode “Tagged for Murder” (October 26,1967), Bruce played a karate instructor, the son of a GI whose dog tags are aclue in a murder mystery. With only a few minutes on-screen and less than adozen lines of dialogue, it was not a big enough part to even qualify for a“guest star” mention in the opening credits but rather as a “co-star” in the endcredits.In his one scene, a detective shows up at Bruce’s school and observes a basicmartial arts demonstration between Bruce and “Judo” Gene LeBell—a bit ofexoticism shoehorned into the plot. Its highlight: LeBell attempts to hip tossBruce but instead Lee jumps over his shoulder and flip throws Gene. This prowrestling sequence was choreographed by LeBell, who was impressed by Bruce’sathletic abilities. “I could pick him up, spin him around, and Bruce would comedown in position to counterattack,” LeBell recalls. “I’d tell him, ‘You’re sogreat you could be a world-class stuntman. We’d have you double all the kids.’Then he’d get mad.”The next year, 1968, was a long dry spell for Bruce’s television career. He onlyhad one big audition. “My agent called to let me know of a CBS proposal for aone hr. series—kind of like ‘I Spy’ called ‘Hawaii 5-O,’ ” Bruce wrote to afriend. “Looks good. Will let you know what develops.” Bruce went up for therole of Detective Chin Ho Kelly. Much to his disappointment, he lost the part toKam Fong Chun, an eighteen-year veteran of the Honolulu Police Department andcommunity theater actor. Hawaii Five-O was the lone drama on American TV tofeature multiple Asian characters in major roles. (Sadly, the same can be saidof its reboot, launched four decades later in 2010.) If Bruce had landed it, hewould have experienced a much different career trajectory. Kam Fong Chun playedDetective Chin Ho Kelly for the next ten years from 1968 to 1978.It took over fourteen months before Bruce was on television screens again with aguest-starring role on Blondie, a short-lived sitcom based on the comic strip.In the episode “Pick on Someone Your Own Size” (January 9, 1969), Bruce onceagain played a karate instructor who teaches the show’s protagonist DagwoodBumstead how to defend himself against a bully. The kicker: when Dagwood finallyfaces off against the bully in his karate stance and screams “Yosh!” the bullytakes the same pose and yells back “Yosh!” Dagwood looks into the camera andwhimpers, “Uh-oh.”The entire training sequence was filmed at Bruce’s school in Chinatown. Thedirector, Peter Baldwin, questioned Bruce about a particularly dangerous-lookingkick he planned to deliver to the show’s star.“Is it safe?” Baldwin asked. “Can you control it?”“Do you trust me?” Bruce asked.“Yes,” Baldwin naively replied.“Stand perfectly still and don’t move,” Bruce said, before suddenly twirling andlashing out a spinning back kick. His foot stopped millimeters from Baldwin’snose.“He won me over with that move,” the director recalls. “We went on to shoot awonderful scene.”During this period, Bruce lost out on a number of roles in Westerns, because herefused to wear a Chinese pigtail, or queue. “Most of those shows want me towear a queue and I won’t do that. I don’t give a damn how much they pay me.Wearing those queues is real degrading,” he explained. “When the Manchus ruledChina, they forced the Chinese natives to wear those damn pigtails to mark themas women.”The only Western to let him keep his Jay Sebring hairstyle was Here Come theBrides. Based on Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954), it was a comedy, set inthe 1870s, about the lumberjacks in the frontier town of Seattle and the onehundred women imported from the East Coast to keep the men from leaving. In theepisode “Marriage, Chinese Style” (April 9, 1969), a Chinese secret societyarranges for a bride from China, Toy Quan, to marry one of its members, LinSung, played by Bruce Lee. But Lin Sung, who is intent on breaking away fromtraditional customs, refuses to marry a woman he has never met. His decisionsets the convoluted plot into motion.The role was unique, because it was the only time in Bruce’s adult career wherehe didn’t play a martial arts master. In fact, his character was a bit of acoward, constantly being threatened or bullied. As a result, Bruce had thechance, as an actor, to work with a different palette of emotions—alarm,humiliation, and fear.Behind the scenes, he was helped into character by his first experience onhorseback. Before filming, the director pulled Bruce to the side and asked him,“Have you ever ridden a horse before?”“No, never,” Bruce said with some trepidation. “I’ve never even seen one upclose.”“Don’t worry about it,” the director attempted to reassure his nervous actor,“the animal we’ve got is real tame.”As one of the handlers brought over his steed, Bruce blurted out, “Holy shit!I’m not gonna ride that damn thing. It’s too big!”“There is nothing to fear,” the director said, soothingly. “He is very gentle,totally harmless, a complete professional.”It took several minutes of pleading and reassuring words from the director andthe rest of the crew to cajole Bruce into the saddle. The horse remainedperfectly motionless as the handler explained how to use the reins to controlthe horse. “But you probably won’t even need them,” said the handler, “becausehe is so friendly.”The moment the handler completed his instructions and stepped away, the horsebolted. Bruce’s cowboy hat flew off his head as he held on to the reins for dearlife. “I started to yell, ‘Whoa!’ but the damn horse never listened,” Brucerecalled. “When it finally stopped, I was far down the field. I got off as fastas I could and was ready to throw stones at it. I walked back to the shootingsite and the damn horse was already there, waiting for me. When the guys sawme—how pissed I was—they started to laugh. I was so mad I couldn’t laugh. Iswore I would never ride a horse again, but that director got me to ride it forseveral more takes. He said that he couldn’t find a stand-in for me. Thatbastard.”Bruce never appeared in a Western or rode a horse again.Image [../images/sec.jpg]In the summer of 1968, Bruce’s reputation as sifu to the stars landed him hisfirst Hollywood movie gig as a “karate advisor” for The Wrecking Crew (1968).The third in a series of parody spy films, it starred Dean Martin as Matt Helmand costarred Sharon Tate, Elke Sommer, and Nancy Kwan as the deadly womentrying to help or harm Martin’s James Bond–like character. The studio paid Bruce$11,000 to teach the cast “karate” and serve as the film’s fight choreographer.(He used the money for the down payment on his Bel Air home.)All of the female costars had already heard about their new teacher. Sharon Tateused to date Jay Sebring. Elke Sommer was married to Bruce’s former student, JoeHyams. And Nancy Kwan, who starred in The World of Suzie Wong (1960), was themost famous Hong Kong actress working in Hollywood. Bruce quickly charmed all ofthem. Nancy Kwan and Bruce developed an older sister–younger brotherrelationship. He would ask her for advice about his acting career. Sharon Tate,who was now married to Roman Polanski, invited Bruce over for dinner, tellingher husband, “The two of you will get along like a house on fire.”  Theydid—Polanski became one of Bruce’s regular clients. “Sharon and Nancy werepretty good students,” Bruce said. “They were doing side kicks with just aminimum of teaching.”Bruce had less success with Dean Martin. “I tried to teach him how to kick,”Bruce said, “but he was too lazy and too clumsy.” He was also too drunk.Martin’s personal assistant carried a shoulder-strapped portable bar to keep himwell lubricated during filming. Bruce realized Martin required someone to doublehim for his fight scenes. As the karate advisor, Bruce was given the authorityto design the fight scenes and hire the extras necessary for them. This was hischance to bring his two worlds together and pay off his high-profile karatefriends.He hired Mike Stone to double for Dean Martin, Ed Parker to play a guard, JoeLewis to play a thug who attacks Martin’s character, and Chuck Norris to deliverone line of dialogue and a high kick. When Bruce called Norris, he said,“There’s a small role that you’d be good for. You’ll play Elke Sommer’sbodyguard, fight Dean Martin, and have one line. Are you interested?” Brucedidn’t need to ask Norris or any of the other karate champions twice.The day before Chuck Norris’s screen debut was Ed Parker’s 1968 Long BeachInternational Karate Championships on August 4, 1968. The martial arts world wasbuzzing about a potential fifth contest between Chuck Norris and Joe Lewis. Intheir four previous encounters, Norris had won the first three but Lewis hadupset him in their fourth. Would Norris revenge his loss and recapture his titleas the best karate fighter in America or had the torch passed to Lewis?But the much-hyped matchup was not to be. Lewis was disqualified in the earlyrounds for intentionally injuring one of his opponents. In the finals, Norriswas scheduled to compete against Skipper Mullins, the number three nationallyranked fighter. The two of them were good friends. In the locker room before thematch, Norris told Skipper, “I have my first part in a movie tomorrow, so beaton my body but try not to hit me in the face. I don’t want to go on the setlooking like I’ve been in a brawl.”“OK,” Skipper smiled, “but you’ll owe me one.”To further merge his movie and martial arts worlds, Bruce Lee arrived at thefinals with a special guest in tow—Steve McQueen. As the crowd applauded theirarrival, Lee and McQueen took their seats of honor in the front row. When Norrismade his way to center stage, Bruce called him over to meet McQueen.“Good luck with the fight,” McQueen said, “and with your scene tomorrow.”“Thank you,” Norris said, slightly in awe.Skipper and Norris went into the ring and bowed. Skipper immediately threw around kick, one of his favorite moves. Norris anticipated this and blocked it,but this time Skipper followed up with a back fist, a technique he had neverused before. The unexpected move caught Norris completely by surprise and flushin his left eye. After an intense struggle, Norris managed to win by one point,leaving the tournament with the trophy and a big black eye.It took the makeup man two hours to hide Norris’s shiner. For his film debut,Norris was only required to say, “May I, Mr. Helm?” Dean Martin was to enter thenightclub, hand Norris his gun, and walk to a booth. Norris had spent two weekspracticing the line, but when the cameras rolled and Dean Martin walked towardhim, he felt his throat tighten and the words whisper out of his mouth. Heassumed his movie career was over, but fortunately the director thought it wasfine.Chuck Norris, Joe Lewis, and Ed Parker had walk-on roles and filmed for a day ortwo, but Mike Stone, as Dean Martin’s double, was on-set for nine weeks and paid$4,500. Despite Martin’s drinking, Stone found him to be “easy to work with,really likeable, always approachable.” Bruce was also a blast on-set. “This guywas an absolute clown,” Stone says, “so wonderful, such a tremendous sense ofhumor, a practical joker, really like a kid. Between shooting, he would show youthese push-ups, play jokes with coins, magic tricks and stuff.”Stone enjoyed Bruce on-set, but he had heard a rumor about Bruce that reallybothered him. Prior to filming, Mito Uyehara, the publisher of Black Belt, hadalerted Stone that Bruce was telling people he was one of the reasons why Stone,Lewis, and Norris were winning tournaments. Stone couldn’t believe it. “I was achampion before I met Bruce.”Bruce and Mike roomed together while they were filming on location in Idyllwild,California. One night as they were about to go to sleep, Stone brought up whatUyehara had told him.“Bruce, listen, I heard something and it’s kind of bothering me,” Stone began,“so I just want to say it and I don’t believe it’s true, but I still have to sayit.”“Well, what is it?” Bruce asked.“Well, Mito pulled me to the side one day at lunch and said you are tellingpeople that Chuck, Joe, and I are winning karate tournaments because we areworking with you. Now I don’t think that’s very accurate because we were alreadysuccessful champions when we met you.”Caught by surprise, Bruce became defensive: “Is that what you really believe,Mike? Is that what you believe?”“No, but I heard it and I wanted to ask you directly.”“Mike, is that what you really believe?” Bruce angrily asked again.“No, Bruce, I don’t believe you said it,” Mike said, trying to mollify thesituation. “It was probably just a misunderstanding.”“But is that what you really believe?” Bruce repeated, unwilling to let it go.Mike and Bruce continued working together on the movie, but that argument cooledoff their friendship. Bruce stopped training with Stone and never hired him foranother movie project. In Bruce’s view, he had given Stone numerous privatelessons for free and yet Mike refused to be grateful. Bruce wasn’t tellingpeople he had made Stone, Norris, and Lewis champions; he was saying he hadhelped them become better champions. He was livid that Stone “really didn’tbelieve” that Bruce deserved any credit for his success.When he got back to Los Angeles, Bruce let Mito Uyehara know how he felt: “Theseguys, just because they’re designated as ‘champions,’ don’t want to beclassified as my students. They want to learn from me but want others to feelthat they are equal or almost equal to me. And they want me to say that they are‘working out’ with me. To me, working out is for them to contribute also butthey don’t; it’s all one-sided. I have to teach them and that’s not workingout.”Unlike Mike Stone, Joe Lewis never had any problem giving Bruce credit for hisinstruction or calling Bruce his “teacher.” Lewis and Lee’s friendship ended fora different reason.Joe’s wife was a beautician. On December 1, 1969, she went over to Bruce’s houseto put highlights in his hair. When she came home, she told Joe that Bruce hadaggressively made a pass at her. Lewis became enraged. He immediately jumpedinto his car and drove over to Bruce’s home to confront him. He went up to theback door and banged on it. When Bruce opened it, Joe accused him: “My wife saysyou made a pass at her.”Bruce took one look at Joe, turned to his wife, and said, “Linda, come here. Iwant you to hear this.”The instant he called Linda over, Joe realized his wife had lied to him and hehad been set up. “She was extremely jealous of all my relationships with my malefriends. She systematically, covertly set about ending all of my friendships,”Lewis recalls. “I felt like a fool. My wife had set me up before this incident,and I immediately knew she had nailed me again. I felt used, tricked, betrayed.I felt there was no way I could ever make this up to Bruce.” Lewis dropped hishead in shame, turned around, and left. When he got home, his wife said Brucewas lying, but he didn’t believe her. Their brief marriage ended soon afterward.In his daytime planner, Bruce wrote: “Joe Lewis over regarding his wife. Endfriendship!” When Bruce later decided to hire an American karate champion forWay of the Dragon (1972), he cast Chuck Norris, since he was the only one Brucestill liked. That film launched Norris’s career, turning him into a householdname. Stone and Lewis tried but never made it in the movie business.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Prior to The Sopranos and the advent of the Golden Age of Television, the boobtube was considered a vast wasteland. While modern stars bounce between TV andcinema like they are interchangeable content platforms, movie actors used toprefer unemployment to television work. And TV actors had almost zero chance ofbreaking into the movies. Over the six-year run of Rawhide (1959–65), ClintEastwood was arguably the most famous actor on TV and yet he had to go to Italyto make several spaghetti westerns (The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly) to prove toHollywood he was a bankable movie star.Even if he had been white and spoke flawless English, Bruce Lee’s dream ofbecoming the world’s biggest box office star would have been the longest of longshots. He had been a sidekick on a ratings-challenged TV series that had barelylasted one season. In the two years since then, his career had stalled. His onlyhope against hope was his celebrity clientele. Every class he taught was a paidaudition with some of the most powerful men in the industry. He needed one ofthem to believe in him so much they would force the studios to give him a movierole.It was Stirling Silliphant who finally came to Bruce’s rescue. Fresh off anOscar win for In the Heat of the Night (1967), he was hired to adapt RaymondChandler’s hardboiled novel The Little Sister. The title was changed to Marlowe,and James Garner was cast as the eponymous detective Humphrey Bogart had madefamous in The Big Sleep (1946). To shoehorn Bruce into the movie, Silliphantsimply invented the character of Winslow Wong, a mob henchman. “By the time ofMarlowe, I had seen so many parodies of a thin guy with a weasel face and a fatguy with a black suit come into offices to threaten people that merely seeingsuch types enter a room would send me into gales of laughter,” Silliphantrecalls. “ ‘So,’ I thought, ‘let’s send in one of the world’s greatest martialartists and have him demolish Marlowe’s office.’ ”This was Lee’s first ever cameo in a Hollywood movie, the big break he had spentthe past two years struggling toward.On August 21, 1968, Bruce began filming his two brief appearances. In the firstthree-minute-long scene, Lee, as Winslow Wong, struts into Marlowe’s officewearing a brown suit and a turtleneck. Winslow has been sent by his mob boss tostop Marlowe’s investigation into a blackmail case. To get the detective’sattention, he immediately sidekicks a hole in his wall and karate chops acoatrack into kindling. Marlowe pulls a gun. Winslow Wong scoffs, “You won’tneed that,” saunters over to his desk, and lays down $500.“For that you can kick the ceiling in,” Marlowe wisecracks.Winslow tells Marlowe to back off: “You are not looking for anybody, you cannotfind anybody, you don’t have time to work for anybody, you have not heard athing, nor seen a thing.”“And what do I do for an encore?” Marlowe asks.“Nothing, keep on doing nothing for a reasonable length of time, and I will comeback and place five more like these on your desk side by side.”“And for whom am I doing all this nothing?”“Winslow Wong, that is I.”“I like a man who uses good grammar,” Marlowe replies.Silliphant wanted to give his sifu some snappy dialogue to showcase his actingchops. It nearly backfired. In the back-and-forth patter, Bruce comes off asstiff and nervous, over-enunciating certain lines and mispronouncing others.Sharon Farrell, who played Orfamay Quest, remembers how much Bruce struggledwith the scene. “Bruce was fine in life, but when he got in front of the camera,he had problems,” Farrell says. “He tried too hard.”Whatever his difficulty with the dialogue, Bruce came alive for the demolitionof Marlowe’s office—the primary reason he was hired. When Marlowe turns downWinslow’s bribe, he flies into action: splintering a bookcase, shattering adoor, and, most spectacularly of all, jump kicking an overhead light hangingfrom an eight-foot ceiling. “Since Bruce had the physical capability of doingthe whole enchilada in one continuous ballet of directed violence, I didn’t wantto cut into it,” says Silliphant. “Director Paul Bogart agreed, and of course, Irank the scene as one of the foremost martial arts scenes ever to appear in anAmerican film.”Bruce told a friend: “Smashing the lamp was no easy trick. That was the hardeststunt in the whole movie. I had to jump real high and didn’t have any helpeither—just a small running space to get my body up there. But it wasspectacular, huh? Oh, the glass wasn’t real. That’s a typical Hollywood gimmick.Yep, it’s made of sugar.”In Bruce’s second and final scene, Winslow Wong confronts Marlowe in a high-risebuilding and invites him out to the windswept terrace. This time wearing a whitesuit and Cuban boots with elevated heels, Winslow attacks with a series ofjumping kicks as Marlowe retreats and insults him for being a paper tiger.Marlowe ends up on the railing overlooking the city far below and taunts,“You’re light on your feet, Winslow. Are you just a little gay, huh?”  Thecamera cuts to a close-up of Bruce’s face as he becomes enraged. He chargesMarlowe with a flying sidekick. Marlowe, who has been setting Winslow up, dodgesat the last second. The force of Winslow’s attack carries him over the side ofthe building and down to this death. “The scene was a real gimmick,” Bruce toldfriends. “I only jumped over a three foot wall.”Marlowe was Bruce’s first chance to play a villain on-screen. He hoped theflashy moves he demonstrated would convince the studios to cast him as the hero.Image [../images/sec.jpg]If Bruce’s challenge was to invent a Hollywood role for himself that didn’t yetexist (the Asian kung fu hero), Sharon Farrell faced the more common problem oftoo much supply for too little demand. Every year thousands of beauty queensfrom every Podunk town in flyover country arrive by the busload hoping to makeit big in Hollywood. A perfect example of the archetype, Farrell was from CedarRapids, Iowa, and she had spent the decade of the 1960s slowly climbing her wayup from starlet roles in TV shows—like “The Actress” in Naked City (1961) and“Kitty Devine” in The Beverly Hillbillies (1965)—to more serious acting parts infilms. Marlowe was only her second significant movie role. Although she wasn’tthe female lead, her character, Orfamay Quest, is the “Little Sister” of RaymondChandler’s title and she is the one who sets the creaky plot into motion whenshe hires Marlowe to find her brother. It was a much bigger part than Bruce’s.When she first laid eyes on Bruce Lee she had no idea who he was. Sharon washeading toward her car in the MGM parking lot after a wardrobe fitting when shenoticed him bopping along about twenty feet away. “He stopped and it was kind ofscary at first and then he started grinning like a little kid, and then hestarted to laugh, and then he started coming towards me. His smile was just likehe had swallowed the sun,” Sharon recalls. “It was like he recognized me. Icouldn’t move. I just started grinning, and he was grinning. It was just joyousand funny. It was like ‘Oh, my God.’ ”Bruce walked over and charmed Farrell, who was in a bad marriage and looking fora little fun. “I was just miserable,” Sharon says. She had recently married hermanager, Ron DeBlasio, believing it would advance her career—only to discoverafter their vows that he wanted her to be a traditional wife.Bruce offered to drive Sharon to her car. She agreed. Bruce circled around theblock several times, mischievously refusing to stop at her car.“Well, what were you going to do?” he asked.“I’ve got some shopping I want to do.”“Okay, we’ll do it together,” he said.Bruce was wearing black jazz stretch pants—tight through the thighs and flaredat the ankles. Sharon told Bruce she liked them. “Well, let’s get some for you,”Bruce said. They drove to Capezio and she bought a few pairs. Then they returnedto her little one-bedroom apartment on Harper Avenue, just below Sunset Strip,that she had lived in before her marriage.Bruce flipped through her collection of records, looking for cha-cha music. “Iwas cha-cha champion of Hong Kong,” he said. “Let me show you.”“I know how to cha-cha,” she said, smiling.They danced around the room—until Sharon tripped over a chair and injured herleg.“Oh, let me fix you,” Bruce said. “I give a great massage.”He proceeded to pick her up and carry her to the bed. As he was rubbing her leg,one thing led to another.“He was the first man I had ever been with who had such a beautiful body. Thoseabs—his muscles were so defined, it was as if they were chiseled,” Sharonrecalls. “Bruce was the most incredible lover I’ve ever been with. He was justso knowledgeable about a woman’s body.”The next day she woke up to find Bruce making a breakfast drink: raw eggs beatenup with some salt and Worcestershire sauce. Sharon wondered what she had gottenherself into. She wanted a cup of coffee and some time to wake up, but Bruce washappily whistling away.“Where are your vitamins?” Bruce asked. When she admitted she didn’t use them,Bruce told her about all the vitamins and supplements she should be taking.After convincing her to drink down the egg mixture, they drove to a popularhealth food store on Sunset Strip. Bruce loaded her shopping cart with vitamins,explaining every one and why exactly Sharon needed to take them.Sharon and Bruce continued their affair throughout the filming of Marlowe. “Wejust were hot and heavy when we could get away,” Sharon remembers. “He wouldsay, ‘I’m coming over,’ and he’d just show up and then he’d drag me into thebedroom.”When they weren’t in bed together, Sharon tried to sketch him. “But he wouldn’tsit still at all. He was always exercising,” she recalls. “He was like a wiggleworm. It made me so mad. Then I would jump down and start trying to beat him up.He was just so much fun.”  The only thing that bored her about Bruce was hisphilosophizing. “When he got kind of preachy about flowing like water, I didn’tget that,” Sharon says. “He would sit and talk about stuff and sometimes I wouldjust tune out.”The honeymoon period didn’t last long. Bruce was happily married; Sharon wasnot. Bruce had no intention of leaving his spouse; Sharon did. One night when hewas talking fondly about his family, Sharon started crying.“What’s the matter?” Bruce asked, swooping her up into his arms.“I know you have a sweet family and a sweet wife and we are so wrong to be doingthis but I want to enjoy what we have for just a little while longer,” Sharonsaid, ashamed at how trapped she felt. “I don’t expect any commitments orpromises and I don’t want to do ‘confessions’ today. I know this is where ourconversation is headed.”After Marlowe wrapped in September, they agreed to stop seeing each other, butit was a difficult promise to keep. They attempted to focus on their work.Sharon had multiple auditions for a major role in an upcoming movie, and Brucewas busy teaching his celebrity clients. “I missed him horribly but I was tryingto do the right thing,” Sharon recalls. “I didn’t call him or ask to see him.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]On September 19, 1968, Steve McQueen invited Bruce to an early screening ofBullitt, the movie that would cement his status as the King of Cool. A weeklater McQueen flew to a location shoot in Carrollton, Mississippi, a tiny townof 250 people, to star as Boon Hogganbeck in The Reivers, a comedy based onWilliam Faulkner’s Pulitzer Prize–winning novel.After several telephone calls to arrange the trip, Bruce followed McQueen toMississippi to serve as his personal kung fu trainer on October 12. McQueenneeded to get into tip-top shape for the October 18 premiere of Bullitt. Brucehad his own hidden reason for wanting to visit the set—Sharon Farrell. She hadbeen auditioning to play the female lead in The Reivers and had landed the partof McQueen’s love interest, Corrie—a hooker with a heart of gold.When Bruce spotted Sharon next to her trailer, he snuck up behind her and puthis hand over her mouth. “Why didn’t you return my calls?” Bruce asked. “Did youreally think I wouldn’t be able to find you?” Bruce dragged her into herdressing room and they made love as quietly as possible, hoping no one wouldhear them.Afterward, Sharon had a confession to make. She had already hooked up with SteveMcQueen. “I’m just using him to get over you,” she said. “But we can’t do thisagain, Bruce. I’m so sorry.”“I understand,” Bruce sighed and smiled sadly. “He’s such a star. I understand,but I will be one too. Can’t you wait for me?”“It doesn’t have anything to do with waiting for you, or you being a star,” sheprotested. “It’s not because he’s a star and you’re training him and you’redoing small parts. I’m doing small parts too.”“Come on, Sharon. This is a big movie, The Reivers,” Bruce snarled. “You are abig star now.”Sharon winced. “Even though I’m Steve’s love interest in this movie, the WintonFlyer has a bigger role than me—the little boy, Mitch, and even Rupert Crosse,all have bigger parts than me.”Bruce just stared angrily at her.“What about your relationship with Steve? What if he finds out about today? Hecould have you blacklisted all over town,” Sharon pleaded. “Oh Bruce, I’m insuch a mess. Go home to your wife, but kiss and hold me first, then just go.”Bruce left Farrell’s trailer. He avoided her for the rest of the week. Sharondidn’t see him again. Her decision tormented her. “I almost went with Bruce. Ifhe had just pushed a little harder, I fear I probably would have walked out ofthat dressing room with him and never looked back,” Sharon recalls. “Bruce tookme to the moon and back. He just turned me inside out. But he was married anddidn’t have a pot to pee in. Steve was so successful—he was my protector. Hehelped me get away from Bruce. I was in lust with Steve, but Bruce was the loveof my life.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]Every marriage is unique and deals with the topic of extramarital affairs in itsown way. Bruce’s approach was to broach the subject hypothetically.“If I ever had an affair with a woman,” Bruce once said to Linda, “it would besomething that happened spontaneously. I would never plan or decide to have amistress or anything of that nature.”“Uh huh,” Linda replied, taken aback.“If that ever happens,” Bruce quickly added, “and if you ever find out about it,I want you to know that it has absolutely no importance at all. All that mattersto me is you and the children. Infidelity has no real bearing on a marriage.Fleeting attraction for another female has no significance regarding a matter sofundamental as a marriage.”“Oh yeah?” she asked, growing upset.“Men are like that,” he said.“Hmmm.” Linda paused, before firmly and emphatically stating her red line. “Ifyou ever leave me for another woman, I won’t hang around forlornly waiting foryou to come back. I’ll be gone—like a flash.”“Would you?” Bruce asked, a little nonplussed.“You’re darned right, I would,” she said. And Bruce knew she meant it.None of Bruce’s Hollywood pals was faithful. The Mad Men double-standard era ofthe 1950s had come to a boil with the Swinging Sixties free love ethos. StirlingSilliphant was married four times. Steve McQueen’s wife, Neile Adams, was awareof his many affairs: “I told him as long as you don’t flaunt it, I can handleit.” Roman Polanski’s second wife, the actress Sharon Tate, confided to one ofher girlfriends that she and Polanski “have a good arrangement. Roman lies tome, and I pretend to believe him.” Even Chuck Norris, the right-wing evangelicalChristian of the bunch, had an illegitimate child, which he confessed to in achapter in his memoir entitled “A Sin That Became a Blessing.” Bruce clearly hadhis friends in mind when he responded to a journalist’s question about the badbehavior in show business by joking: “Well, let me put it this way, to be honestand all that, I’m not as bad as some of them. But I’m definitely not saying I ama saint.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]Much to Silliphant’s and Bruce’s disappointment, Marlowe did not launch hismovie career. Released on October 31, 1969, it was a dud at the box office anddrubbed by the critics. Variety wrote, “Marlowe is a plodding, unsure piece ofso-called sleuthing in which James Garner can never make up his mind whether toplay it for comedy or hardboil.” Roger Ebert reserved his only praise for BruceLee’s two scenes, although he didn’t deem him important enough to use his nameor get his ethnicity right: “Somewhere about the time when the Japanese karateexpert wrecks his office (in a very funny scene), we realize Marlowe has losttrack of the plot, too. Marlowe becomes enjoyable only on a basic level; it’sfun to watch the action sequences. Especially when the karate expert goes overthe edge.”Despite being a flop in America, MGM decided to release Marlowe in Asia threeyears later after Bruce became famous in Hong Kong. “They are going to give metop billing,” Lee bragged to a journalist. “I really don’t know how I’m going toexplain that to Garner when I get back to Hollywood.”He never had the chance to tease James Garner. But he did try to rekindle hisrelationship with Sharon Farrell. They ran into each other by accident at aBeverly Hills doctor’s office in 1973. Lee Marvin was also in the waiting room.“He gave me his phone number,” Sharon says. “Lee Marvin looked away when Brucegrabbed me and kissed me.” Bruce was finally the big star he promised Sharon heone day would be. But Sharon lost the piece of paper. “I thought I put it in mypurse, but I couldn’t find it afterwards,” she says. “I must have dropped it onthe floor.”"},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f0258-01.jpg]Stirling Silliphant and Bruce working on the screenplay for The Silent Flute atSilliphant’s Pingree Production offices, circa May 1970.

(David Tadman)"},{"pageContent":"FOURTEENTHE SILENT FLUTESteve McQueen may have stolen Bruce’s girl, but Bruce still needed him. Formonths he had been lobbying Steve about making a martial arts movie together.Bruce knew no Hollywood studio would back a kung fu flick with him in it unlessthere was also an A-list star attached. In response to Bruce’s entreaties,McQueen had been cautious and noncommittal about the idea.Bruce’s plan was to get a firm commitment from McQueen on the Mississippi set ofThe Reivers. After his tryst and breakup with Sharon Farrell in her trailer,Bruce approached McQueen and told him that Stirling Silliphant was eager towrite the script. “Will you star in it?” he asked.“You should talk to my business partner, Robert Relyea, first,” McQueen dodged.Bruce sat down with Relyea, who was also the executive producer on The Reivers,and made his pitch: Steve McQueen to star, Stirling Silliphant to write, andBruce Lee to costar in the first ever martial arts movie made in America. Toillustrate the concept, Bruce showed Relyea his boyhood stack of Hong Kong kungfu comic books. “This will be the next big trend in films,” Bruce said. “All weneed is the financing.”Robert Relyea didn’t think it was a good career move for McQueen. He tried togently turn Bruce down, but when Bruce didn’t take the hint and kept pushing,Relyea finally exploded: “Stop bothering me, Kato, and forget this crap aboutstarring in movies. Just concentrate on keeping our star in shape. And doyourself a favor. Throw away those stupid comic books—they’re a waste of time!”A less determined man might have given up, but, after returning fromMississippi, Bruce met with Silliphant and argued that they should pitch McQueentogether. He was certain the two of them could convince Steve to say yes.Once McQueen agreed to a meeting, they went to the Castle to explain the storyconcept: Cord the Seeker embarks on a journey to discover the true nature of themartial arts. Along the way, Cord must defeat several enemies—Blind Man, RhythmMan, Monkey Man, and Panther Man—who represent greed, fear, anger, and death.There would be tons of great fight scenes. McQueen would, of course, be thehero, Cord, while Bruce would play all four of the enemies.“Hmm,” Steve paused. “Do you have a script yet?”“No,” Bruce said, “but Stirling is the best screenwriter in Hollywood.”“If you sign on,” Silliphant said to McQueen, “I’ll write it.”“I don’t know. My schedule is pretty booked at the moment,” McQueen said, tryingto be polite. “I couldn’t get involved right now. But once you have a script,I’ll read it.”As McQueen hedged, Bruce tried to keep his cool. This project was his ticket toa Hollywood movie career. He was desperate to get it made. He had a Bel Airhome, a Porsche, and a young family—none of which he could afford at his currentincome level. Without McQueen on board, Silliphant would drop out and then Brucewould be back to square one.Bruce pressed Steve to accept the deal. This was a tactical mistake. McQueen wasa loyal friend but he was not a generous actor. He fired directors who didn’tmake him look good, writers who didn’t give him the best lines, and actors whowere taller than him. He stole scenes from his male costars and slept with hisfemale leads. Bruce may have believed he was Steve’s kung fu master, but McQueensaw him as a high-priced personal trainer who had forgotten his place.“Let’s face it, Bruce, this is a vehicle to make a big star out of you, and Igotta be honest with you, I’m not in this business to make stars out of otherpeople,” McQueen finally replied. “I love you, buddy, but you’re just going tobe hanging on my coattails and I’m just not going to do that. I’m not going tocarry you on my back.”Having been slapped down, Bruce left the mansion in a rage. As he stood in thecourtyard with Silliphant, he looked up at the windows, raised his fist, andshouted, “I’m going to be bigger than he is. Who the hell is he to tell me hewon’t do this film with me? I’ll be a bigger star than Steve McQueen!”Image [../images/sec.jpg]After McQueen’s refusal, Bruce fell into a funk. He started avidly readingself-help books: Napoleon Hill’s Think and Grow Rich!, Norman Vincent Peale’sThe Power of Positive Thinking, and Dale Carnegie’s How to Win Friends &Influence People. His favorite author was Hill, who advised his readers to writedown a goal and recite it over and over, morning and night.On January 7, 1969, Bruce wrote down his life goal. Entitled “My Definite ChiefAim,” his ambitious and uncanny prophecy reads: “I, Bruce Lee, will be the firsthighest paid Oriental super star in the United States. In return I will give themost exciting performances and render the best of quality in the capacity of anactor. Starting 1970 I will achieve world fame and from then onward till the endof 1980 I will have in my possession $10,000,000. I will live the way I pleaseand achieve inner harmony and happiness.”The first part of his prediction was a reaction to McQueen’s rejection, whilethe last line was pure wishful thinking. Despite their many side benefits, fameand fortune rarely lead to inner harmony or happiness—as Bruce would soondiscover. McQueen had made Lee lose face in front of Silliphant. The Americanpart of Bruce read self-help books, set down goals, and looked to the future.The Chinese half required revenge.Paul Newman was to Steve McQueen what McQueen was to Bruce Lee—the older brotherhe loved, envied, and ached to defeat. “It was a weird ‘professional siblingrivalry,’ ” writes Marshall Terrill, McQueen’s best biographer. “Throughout hiscareer, McQueen used Newman as a measuring stick for his success and vowed thatone day he would catch up with Newman. Steve’s fierce competitiveness woulddrive him ever onward.”If McQueen didn’t want to be in his movie, Bruce would offer the part to PaulNewman. He asked Jay Sebring, who cut Newman’s hair, to recruit Paul as a kungfu student. Once they started training together, Bruce planned to pitch hisproject. But it didn’t happen. For unknown reasons, Newman never became one ofBruce’s students. Without McQueen or Newman, Bruce’s movie project appeared deadin the water.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Seeing that Bruce was in a terrible emotional and financial state, Silliphantagreed to stick with the project. “Bruce was bereft,” Silliphant recalls. “Thiscrazy film was not just a passing fancy. It became an obsession; this was hisroad to stardom.”  They still needed a star, so on January 13, 1969, Bruce andSilliphant met for lunch and called James Coburn. They offered him the part ofCord and, to sweeten the deal, the chance to direct his first movie. Coburn, wholoved Bruce and always wanted to direct, jumped at the chance. The three menquickly signed off on the organizational chart: Silliphant and Coburn wouldco-produce, Coburn would direct and play the lead, and Bruce would play all fourof the costarring roles and choreograph the fight scenes.“Will you write it?” Bruce eagerly asked Silliphant.“No, I’m up to my ears in work and I don’t have time to do it,” said Stirling,who had recently signed to write a Japanese samurai movie. “I could talk to mynephew, Mark. He’s a hip, young screenwriter—very talented. He’ll get it.”Bruce was hesitant. Coburn was a successful actor, but he was not on SteveMcQueen’s level. To get a studio to finance the project, they needed afirst-rate screenplay.“Let’s meet with Mark next week to discuss the project,” Coburn suggested. “Doyou have a working title, Bruce?”“Not yet. Let’s call it ‘Project Leng’ for now,” Bruce said. “Leng means‘beautiful’ in Cantonese.”Seven days later Bruce, Jim, and Stirling met with Mark Silliphant to discussProject Leng. Bruce left the meeting deeply concerned about Mark’s ability todeliver. After considering the issue, Bruce decided to write the outlinehimself. Over the next month, Bruce followed the same schedule: in the mornings,he listened to motivational tapes, read out loud “My Definite Chief Aim,” andvisualized becoming the highest-paid Oriental superstar in the United States. Inthe afternoons, he wrote the treatment for Project Leng.On February 28, 1969, Bruce met with Stirling and Coburn at Silliphant’s officeto present his new story ideas and argue that Mark should be replaced with aveteran screenwriter. Stirling and James liked the presentation but were lessenthusiastic about removing Mark. He was working on spec (i.e., for free), whilea veteran screenwriter would demand to be paid up front. Since Bruce didn’t haveany money, the fee would fall on Silliphant and Coburn. After someback-and-forth, they finally agreed with Bruce, who later wrote to a friend: “Wewill speed up the process as soon as the professional comes up with thetreatment. Everything is going big gun.”The prospect of being fired by his famous uncle lit a fire under Mark, whopleaded with Stirling not to replace him. Stirling relented. Mark could keepworking on the project in secret. If what he wrote was good, Stirling would showit to Coburn and Lee. Stirling warned his nephew to write fast. There was only asmall window of opportunity when Bruce would be distracted from his obsessionwith Project Leng. Stirling had found another way to help Bruce Lee make hismortgage payments.Image [../images/sec.jpg]After Marlowe, Silliphant’s next screenplay was A Walk in the Spring Rain, alove story starring Ingrid Bergman and Anthony Quinn. He snuck a fight sceneinto the script and convinced Columbia Pictures to hire Bruce as the fightcoordinator. “Since the story was located in the Tennessee Mountains, I couldn’twrite any Orientals into the fight because they simply don’t have Asians downthere in Gatlinburg,” Silliphant explains. “But I did bring Bruce to Tennesseeto choreograph the fight.”On April 17, 1969, Bruce arrived in Gatlinburg to stage the scene with two localstuntmen—big redneck types, who resented that Silliphant had brought in anoutsider. They took one look at this 135-pound, bespectacled Chinese guy andscoffed, “A stiff breeze would blow him over.”“This little guy, pound for pound, can rip a lion’s ass,” Silliphant told them,“so you better not mess with him.”“Bullshit,” they replied.“We better clear this up,” Silliphant said, “because he’s your boss and you areworking for him.”Silliphant explained the situation to Bruce and suggested a demonstration.Without hesitation, Bruce grabbed a kicking shield from one of his bags.“Okay, one of you guys hold this shield,” Bruce said to the two stuntmen. “I’mgoing to give it a little kick. But I suggest you brace yourself first, because,you know, I kick pretty hard.”“Sure, buddy, sure,” they chuckled.“Hey, let’s make this interesting,” Silliphant interjected, “and stand them nextto the swimming pool.”“Cool, man, cool,” the stuntmen said.The first guy held the air shield loosely next to his chest and grinned at hisfriend. With no movement, no run, nothing, just standing in front of the guy,Bruce flicked out a sidekick that catapulted the stuntman into the middle of thepool.The second stuntman didn’t believe it. “No way. That’s a trick. Some kind ofChinese magic,” he said, picking up the shield and bracing himself like alinebacker. “Try that shit on me.”Bruce’s next kick sent the second one nearly to the end of the pool, almostmissing the water. As the stuntmen climbed out of the pool, rubbing theirchests, their attitudes were completely adjusted. “These guys came upChristians! Instant baptism!” recalls Silliphant. “They became slaves of Bruce,and Bruce loved it.”While they were in Tennessee, Stirling informed Bruce that he had given hisnephew a second chance to work on the project. After they returned to LosAngeles, Stirling, James, and Bruce met with Mark over lunch on May 12, 1969,and told him what they wanted. Six weeks later, Mark sent them his treatment forthe project. No one liked it. On July 25, Mark was fired a second time, and thethree principals agreed to find a professional screenwriter. Their search,however, was delayed by what happened the night of August 8, 1969.Image [../images/sec.jpg]On August 7, 1969, Jay Sebring visited Steve McQueen to give his friend a trimin the living room of the Castle. Sebring planned to check in on his formergirlfriend, Sharon Tate, the next night, and he invited McQueen to join him.Steve, who had also dated Sharon, agreed. Tate was eight and a half monthspregnant, and her husband, Roman Polanski, was stuck in London finishing ascreenplay. Sharon had been semiseriously complaining to all her friends abouthow her husband had left her alone with two annoying houseguests: VoytekFrykowski, an old friend of Polanksi’s from Poland, and his girlfriend, AbigailFolger, heiress to the Folger coffee fortune.The next night Sebring planned to pick up McQueen, but Steve canceled at thelast moment when he unexpectedly ran into a former lover and decided to spendthe evening with her instead. Sebring drove to Tate’s home alone.At the Spahn Movie Ranch on the outskirts of Los Angeles County, Charles Mansontold his hippie cult followers: “Now is the time for Helter Skelter.” Borrowedfrom the Beatles song, it was Manson’s term for what he prophesied was thecoming apocalyptic race war between blacks and whites. He hoped to incite therevolution by killing some wealthy white people and pointing the blame at blackmilitants. Manson told his young followers Tex Watson, Susan Atkins, PatriciaKrenwinkel, and Linda Kasabian: “Go to the former home of Terry Melcher and killeveryone on the premises.” (Melcher, a well-known record producer, had snubbedManson, an aspiring musician.) Manson didn’t know exactly who lived there, butsaid they were “entertainment types.” Late at night on August 8, 1969, the fourManson cult members drove to Melcher’s former home—currently being rented bySharon Tate and Roman Polanski.Shortly after midnight, Tex Watson, Susan Atkins, and Patricia Krenwinkelentered the house while Linda Kasabian waited outside. Through a frenzied andhorrific combination of shooting, stabbing, beating, and hanging, they murderedSharon Tate and her unborn baby boy, Jay Sebring, Abigail Folger, VoytekFrykowski, and Steven Parent, an eighteen-year-old visitor. Before leaving,Susan Atkins dipped a towel in Sharon Tate’s blood and used it to scrawl “Pig”across the front door in a vain attempt to make the crimes look like the work ofblack militants.The grisly massacre rattled the nation, terrorized Hollywood, and signaled theend of the 1960s peace and love era. The Tate murders became the single biggestcrime story since the kidnapping and murder of the Lindbergh baby in 1932.Within hours, the carnage in the Hollywood Hills was front-page news across theworld, elbowing aside the triumphant return of the Apollo 11 astronauts from themoon and the investigation of Senator Edward Kennedy’s mysterious accident atChappaquiddick. “This hit the movie community very deeply,” recalls WarrenBeatty. “The collective response to these killings was what you might expect ifa small nuclear device had gone off.” Writer Dominick Dunne says, “People wereconvinced that the rich and famous of the community were in peril. Children weresent out of town. Guards were hired.”The personal and physical proximity of the murders shook Bruce to his core. JaySebring was one of his closest friends in Hollywood and largely responsible forlaunching his acting and private kung fu teaching careers. Bruce had taughtSharon Tate how to kick for The Wrecking Crew, and Roman Polanski was a client.Bruce and Linda had been guests at their home. “That was a very scary andhorrible time, because our friends had been murdered,” Linda recalls. “It alsohappened just a couple of canyons across from where we lived. The sense wasthere were crazy people out there randomly killing.”On August 13, 1969, Bruce attended Sharon Tate’s funeral with Joe Hyams at 11a.m. After lunch, they went to Jay Sebring’s funeral at 2:30. It was a sad andfrightening day for the attendees, which included Paul Newman, Henry Fonda, andJames Coburn. Afterward, Bruce told a friend, “The house was only a couple milesaway. Boy, when things like that happen in your own backyard, it scares the hellout of you, especially when you have a family. From what I picked up at thefuneral, what they did to the victims was awful. Even the papers couldn’tdescribe it. It was just too brutal.”For three months, the police investigated the murders without any suspects.Bruce remained hypervigilant, taking extra precautions around the house.Polanski, who was crazed with grief, tried to catch the killers. He wasconvinced somebody in his own circle—possibly a jealous husband—was responsible.The police had found a pair of horn-rimmed glasses that no one could identify onthe floor not far from Sharon’s and Jay’s bodies. Had the killer or killersdropped them? Polanski went to an optician’s outlet on Beverly Drive and boughta Vigor lens-measuring gauge—a gadget the size and shape of a pocket watch—toaid his private investigation.To protect himself, Polanski continued his self-defense lessons with Bruce.Several days a week they worked out at the Paramount gym. One morning, Brucequite casually mentioned, “I’ve lost my glasses.”“I never liked your old pair anyway,” Polanski said. “After class, why don’t Idrive you to my optician’s and buy you a new frame as a gift.”On the drive over, Polanski’s heart raced. Bruce was part of the circle offriends, but he was also, as the only Asian, an outsider looking in. He knew howto use a gun and was an expert in bladed weapons. He had the strength and skillto overpower multiple victims. Perhaps Sebring had invited him over andsomething had gone terribly wrong. Perhaps he was secretly in love with Tate andhad snapped.When they arrived at the eyeglasses store, Bruce selected new frames and toldthe clerk his prescription. Polanski breathed a sigh of relief. “As I hadhoped,” Polanski recalls, “his prescription bore no resemblance to the lensesfound at the scene of the crime.” Polanski never revealed to Bruce his briefsuspicions. In their mutual grief, the two men became extremely close. Polanskilater invited Bruce to his chalet in Gstaad, Switzerland, for a weeklong skivacation and Jeet Kune Do training seminar.Image [../images/sec.jpg]A month after the crime, Silliphant and Coburn put up $12,000 ($80,000 in 2017dollars) to hire a screenwriter named Logan. He took three months to complete ascreenplay for Project Leng. Once again, no one liked it. “He brought in ascript,” recalls Silliphant, “that was mostly science fiction and screwing. Noneof our plot. So we fired him.”Having already failed twice, Bruce and Coburn pleaded with Silliphant to writethe script. He relented but under one condition. “Okay, I’ll write the goddamnedthing,” Silliphant said. “But I’m not going to do it alone while you guys areoff fishing. We are going to meet three nights a week in my office from 5–7 p.m.We will dictate the scenes and ideas to my secretary and get it down.”Now over a year into this project, they met religiously through March, April,and May of 1970—twenty script meetings in total. “Bruce and Jimmy contributedenormously and richly to the texture of the script, so that you could smell it,”recalls Silliphant. “It was there, and we all got excited.”  The three menbrought radically different flavors to the stew. Bruce filled it with Taoism,Zen Buddhism, and his Jeet Kune Do philosophy, Coburn sprinkled in some mysticalIslamic Sufi parables, and Silliphant added some meditations on the timelessstate of mind from T. S. Eliot’s Four Quartets.The result, which they entitled The Silent Flute, was the most ambitious andavant-garde kung fu screenplay ever written. Instead of the typicalrevenge-driven story line, it was a metaphysical meditation on the meaning ofthe martial arts. Coburn explained: “The martial arts are used as a tool toportray the self-evolution of man.”In the final draft, the hero, Cord, seeks the Bible of Martial Arts, whichcontains the secrets of unarmed combat. He must fight his way through threetrials, representing Ego, Love, and Death. His guide is Ah Sahm, a blind man whosymbolizes his unconscious and plays a flute only Cord can hear. At the end ofhis bloody journey, Cord rejects the Bible, which represents organized religion,unifies with Ah Sahm, and disappears into nirvana.The screenplay’s structure is pure Joseph Campbell’s The Hero with a ThousandFaces, the dialogue groovy, trippy, and stained with pot smoke, and the level ofsex and violence extreme even by modern standards. The gruesome murders ofSharon Tate and Jay Sebring haunt every page. One scene includes a crucified,decapitated woman with a rose sticking out of her neck; others featureintestines being ripped from a giant black man and a beautiful young boy’sbrains leaking from a crushed skull. Cord’s second trial (love) involves anelaborate lesson in tantric sex with a beautiful concubine. The scene’sdescription reads in part: “Lying together fully relaxed, she parts with herfingers the lips of her vulva and partially inserts his penis.”  The concubinethen says, “These two labia are the fire in the middle. We will lie thus forawhile until we are prepared for the inexpressible experience of unity we callsamsara when time and eternity become one.”But wait, there’s more. The authors intended for the movie to be filmed in threelocations (Thailand, Japan, and Morocco) and six languages (Thai, Cantonese,Arabic, Japanese, Urdu, and English). With their script complete, all theyneeded was a Hollywood studio crazy enough to finance an X-rated,multimillion-dollar, multilingual, mystical, martial arts movie.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Before they had a chance to pitch any studios, Bruce Lee was sidelined with apotentially career-ending injury. On August 13, 1970, exactly one year afterTate’s and Sebring’s funerals, he placed a 125-pound barbell on his shouldersand bent over from the waist while keeping his back straight—a “Good Morning”exercise. On this particular day, for whatever reason, Bruce failed to warm upproperly, and something snapped in his back. At first he only felt a mild twingeof discomfort, but over the next few days, the pain became more severe, forcinghim to seek out a doctor. After extensive examinations, the final diagnosis wasthat he had injured his fourth sacral nerve, permanently.The doctors prescribed three months of bed rest followed by three more months ofrehab. He asked if he would be back to normal after six months. They told him toforget about kung fu: “You will never kick high again.” For Bruce Lee, this waslike a death sentence. The martial arts were his whole life and livelihood. Howwas he going to realize his Definite Chief Aim? What would he do for work? Howwould his family survive?For three months, Bruce was confined to a bed—an exquisite form of torture forsomeone as hyperactive as “Never Sits Still.” He only left the house for hisweekly treatment of cortisone injections. It was a hell of mental anguish,physical agony, and financial stress. “I really got scared because I just gotShannon and I spent a lot of money on doctors for my treatment,” Bruce told afriend. “I’m not afraid for myself because I can always exist, but when you haveothers to feed, it scared me a lot.”As he lay flat on his back unable to act or teach, the bills piled up. Evenbefore the injury, Bruce had overextended himself and failed to save a penny fora rainy day. He had gambled everything on The Silent Flute—a project entirelydependent on his physical health. As the family’s prospects for solvency wentfrom dim to dismal, Linda made a decision.“I’m going to work,” she told Bruce.“Absolutely not,” her proud patriarchal Chinese husband replied. “You alreadyhave a job: wife and mother. It would be a disgrace and loss of face for my wifeto work.”“I’m getting a job,” she insisted. It was one of the few times she ever stood upto him. Linda almost always let Bruce have his way, unless his bullheadednesswas harmful to the children. Protecting them was her first priority.Without a college degree, past work history, or qualifications of any kind, sheapplied for a job at an answering service. Under past experience on theapplication, she put down: secretarial chores for my husband’s business. “It wastrue enough,” Linda reflects. She got the minimum-wage job and worked eveningsfrom four to eleven with an hour commute each way. She fed five-year-old Brandonand sixteen-month-old Shannon dinner at three before leaving Bruce to look afterthe kids. It was his first time changing a diaper. To save face, Bruce insistedthey never tell anyone that his wife was working. He developed an elaboratescheme of excuses for why Linda was not at home if anyone called or came over:she is shopping or visiting friends. Linda would come home after midnight tofind Shannon, Brandon, and Bruce asleep. “But Bruce would often leave mebeautiful notes of love and appreciation, which made it all worthwhile,” shesays.Seeing him so despondent and worried, Linda said to her husband, “Perhaps itwould have been easier for you to achieve your goals if you had not had theresponsibility of me and the children.”“No matter what, no matter how bad times are and how bad they become,” Brucereplied, “I want you to know that the most important thing in my life is to haveyou and the children around me.”Trapped in bed, Bruce’s brain roamed free. For inspiration, he read all theworks of Krishnamurti. Then he began to write. He filled eight notebooks withscript ideas, quotes from his favorite authors, and commentary on the martialway. He wrote constantly, putting into words his training methods and philosophyof Jeet Kune Do. He later considered turning his notes into a book but ran outof time. After his death, Linda published some of his notes as The Tao of JeetKune Do, the best-selling martial arts book of all time.Once he could walk again, Bruce began slowly rehabilitating by trying a littlebit of resistance training to strengthen his muscles. He also utilized someEastern medicine, like acupuncture. Bruce decided the doctors were wrong. Hewould practice martial arts again, and he would accomplish this through hardwork and positive thinking. On the back of one of his business cards, he wrote“Walk On!” and placed it on the stand next to his desk for motivation.After five months, Bruce began working out moderately and resuming lighttraining. To the shock of his physicians, Bruce was soon able to do everythinghe could before. He could kick high. He was his old self with one exception: hisback remained a chronic source of discomfort for the rest of his life. He simplydecided it would not stand in his way, pushed through the pain, and once againwas able to lead what appeared to outsiders to be his normal lifestyle.Image [../images/sec.jpg]After much discussion, Silliphant and Coburn agreed that the only studioexecutive audacious enough to back an X-rated mystical martial arts movie wasTed Ashley, the new chairman of Warner Bros. He had been hired to turn aroundthe failing studio by focusing on the counterculture youth market and hadrecently enjoyed great commercial success with the Woodstock documentary (1970).Silliphant intended to pitch The Silent Flute as the Easy Rider (1969) of fightfilms.As one of the most famous screenwriters in town, Silliphant was able to convinceAshley to invite him and Bruce Lee to an exclusive dinner party at Ashley’sBeverly Hills mansion. “It was strictly for the most important people in themovie industry,” Bruce bragged to friends. “These men have enormous power tomake a movie or kill it. Some actors would give their right arm to be invited.”As proof of the movie’s concept, Silliphant asked Bruce to give a short kung fudemonstration for the VIP crowd. He immediately took control of the room. “Ivividly recall Bruce astonishing us with his demonstrations of various kicks andbreaks,” recalls Ted Ashley. “It took my breath away! It was one thing to knowthat there is something called ‘martial arts,’ but it was another thing entirelyto be two or three feet away from it.”Having wowed the boss, Silliphant submitted the screenplay to Warner Bros. “Theyinstantly loved it,” Silliphant claims. Perhaps, but in Hollywood talk is cheap;true love is measured in money. Warners would make the film but not with asingle American dollar. The entire movie had to be filmed in India where WarnerBros. had huge sums of frozen funds. The Indian government did not allowAmerican film studios to remit the money they made at Indian box offices back tothe United States; it could only be used to make movies in India. The problemwas no American producer or director wanted to film in a country as impoverishedas India, so the money was trapped. Ted Ashley told Silliphant, “The rupees aresitting in India. You guys go over and figure it out.”On January 29, 1971, they flew first class from Los Angeles to Bombay (Mumbai)to scout locations for the next two weeks. Coburn and Silliphant arrived withgrave reservations—both had been to India before and didn’t think thesubcontinent was right for their film. Bruce was eager and filled with hope. Onthe plane flight from Bombay to New Delhi, Bruce worked out his nervous energyby repeatedly punching a thick notebook in his lap.“Hey, man, you’ve been doing that for an hour now,” Coburn finally complained.“Can’t you stop it for awhile?”“I’ve got to keep in shape,” Bruce apologized.From New Delhi, they were driven north to the desert on the border withPakistan. As the star, Coburn was seated up front with Silliphant and Lee wassitting in back. “The road is terrible!” Bruce wrote to Linda. “And driving is anightmare.” Hour after hour on patchy dirt roads was extremely rough on Bruce’sback. To distract himself, Bruce started singing pop songs under his breath,mile after mile. Coburn finally turned around and said, “For Christ’s sake willyou stop that. You’re driving me crazy.” When Coburn turned back, Bruce shookhis fist at the back of Coburn’s head.They stopped at a dumpy dive for lunch but the food was inedible. Bruce ordereda couple of lamb chops, which he couldn’t chew. He threw his food to a starvingdog that had been watching them. Instantly, from the kitchen, three Indianwaiters came out with sticks and brooms and started beating the dog and took themeat away. Bruce stood up indignantly, intent on pounding the waiters into thedirt. Coburn grabbed Bruce’s arm and shook his head. The cook came over andsaid, “Pardon me, Sahib, but you don’t understand. Our children have no food,and to give it to a dog is wrong.”  Tears welled up in Bruce’s eyes. “I thoughtI saw poverty in Hong Kong when I was growing up, but it was nothing compared toIndia,” Bruce later told a friend. “I never realized how good we live until Iwent there. Flies all over the place. Starvation, very common. People and kids,begging for food, some lying along dusty roads, dying from lack of food.”From northern India, they flew south to Madras (Chennai). Bruce would point outof the window: “Hey, it’s beautiful down there. We can shoot down there.”“You can’t put a crew down there,” Coburn said. “What are we going to do,parachute them into the jungles? Where are we going to put the generator? Whereare we going to live?”Besides adequate locations, they also hoped to find talented local martialartists for the fight scenes to avoid the cost of flying in foreign stuntmen. InMadras, they held tryouts for local fighters. Nine Indian martial artists showedup. Bruce stood in front of the group and said, “Now, let’s see where you areat—what you can do.” All of a sudden, it was utter chaos. The nine guys juststarted beating the hell out of each other. Within seconds, one guy wasstreaming blood from his mouth. Bruce held up his hand and shouted, “No, no!Hold it a minute! Look, this is what I mean.” Without any warm-up and with a badback, Bruce gave a little demonstration that left them awestruck. They had neverseen anything like it. When he finished, they all went down on their knees.“What do you think?” Coburn asked him afterward. “Can we use any of them?”“No way,” Bruce said. “It would take me at least three years to train any ofthose fellows to the right level.”At the airport as they waited for the flight to Goa, Bruce noticed a group ofIndian boys staring at him. They had never seen a Chinese man in person. Hecalled them over and began performing magic tricks, snatching coins from theirhands or making a fork disappear. More boys gathered. Bruce demonstrated kicks,punches, and kung fu forms for the kids. The boys laughed and applauded. Coburn,who preferred to travel quietly, sighed in annoyance.They arrived at the beaches of Goa to find them overrun by Western hippies fromAmerica, Germany, France, and Britain, beautiful long-haired young people lyingaround naked. “God knows how but all the hippie kids knew who Bruce Lee was,”recalls Silliphant. “They must have seen him in The Green Hornet. They knew himmore than they knew Coburn.”  The hippies invited them to hang out. For twodays, Silliphant, Coburn, and Lee smoked Nepalese hash and talked about how toadapt their screenplay for India. Coburn didn’t think it was possible,Silliphant was ambivalent, and Bruce anxiously tried to convince them that theycould shoot around bad locations. “Warner Bros. wants to do it. Why wouldn’t wedo it?” Bruce argued. “To hell with the locations, we can make this work. Wewill make this work.”Warner Bros. had paid for the entire trip out of blocked rupees and made all thearrangements. At every hotel, James Coburn, as the director and star, was giventhe biggest suite, while Silliphant, the lowly writer, and Lee, the no-nameChinese actor, were put in adjoining closet-sized rooms. The lumpy bed in theGoa Hotel irritated Bruce’s back. By the time they flew to Bombay for their lastnight before returning home, the pain was excruciating. A chauffeur drove themfrom the airport to the Taj Mahal palace. Coburn was checked in to a suite thesize of a house. “It was embarrassing, you could put an entire productioncompany in this thing,” Silliphant recalls. “Of course, he wasn’t apologizing;he was a big star. This is his due, right?” Lee and Silliphant once again hadtiny rooms. Bruce was indignant. This was the final blow and he became enraged.“One day I will be a bigger star than McQueen and Coburn,” Bruce declared toSilliphant.“You are Chinese in a white man’s world,” Silliphant told Bruce. “There’s noway.”On February 11, 1971, they departed from Bombay divided. Coburn was convincedIndia was completely wrong for the project artistically. Silliphant didn’t thinkIndia was ideal, but was certain kung fu movies were the next big trend andbelieved it was worthwhile to get a jump on the market. Bruce couldn’t afford tolet the project die. Coburn and Silliphant offered to help him with his moneyproblems, but Bruce was too proud and refused.When Coburn told Warner Bros. the movie couldn’t be made in India, the studiojettisoned the project—it was blocked rupees or nothing. Bruce was furious,bitter, and brokenhearted. He felt betrayed by his closest Hollywood friends.“Coburn screwed it up,” Bruce declared with anger in his voice. “He didn’t wantto go back to India so he told Warner Brothers that India had no good locations.He killed the whole damn project. I was counting so heavily on that movie. Itwas my one chance of a lifetime. Shit, if I knew he was gonna do that, Iwouldn’t have had him as a partner.”Even after Coburn and Warner Bros. dropped out, Bruce refused to give up on TheSilent Flute. He couldn’t admit defeat or let the fantasy go. “Silent Flute ismoving along fine,” he assured his Oakland student Leo Fong. “We ran into someproblems in location, but we should know real soon on the official date.” Brucemet with other producers. He pitched Roman Polanski: “If you ever want to directa meaningful martial arts movie. . . .” For months he kept at it withoutresults. “Nothing new developed with Silent Flute,” he wrote to his L.A. studentLarry Hartsell on June 6, 1971. “It’s a matter of time.”Slowly, piece by piece, the dream died."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f0276-01.jpg]James Franciscus (Mike Longstreet) and Bruce Lee (Li Tsung) between takes onLongstreet, June 1971.

Ed wrote and sold jokes to Phyllis Diller and Johnny Carson.But ever since watching Akira Kurosawa’s 1956 classic Seven Samurai as ateenager, Spielman’s real passion was Asian culture. While Bruce was studyingphilosophy at the University of Washington, Ed was one of five students inBrooklyn College’s Chinese language department. As an extracurricular he studiedJapanese karate and, after he graduated, Chinese kung fu.Still obsessed with Kurosawa, Spielman decided to write his first treatment fora movie about Miyamoto Musashi, Japan’s most famous samurai. In the first draft,Musashi travels to the Shaolin Temple in China and befriends a Shaolin monk, whoteaches him kung fu. Sometime in 1967, Spielman gave the story to hiscomedy-writing partner, Howard Friedlander, a graduate of New York Universityfilm school.“The story of that monk just resonated with me. I loved that character,”Friedlander says. “I suddenly got this idea—it burst in my brain—and I turned tohim and said, ‘Ed, it’s a Western.’ And he said, ‘What?’ And I said, ‘It’s aWestern. The Shaolin monk—bring him to the West.’ And his mouth dropped open. Herealized that was it.”  They went to Friedlander’s apartment and started writingthe outline. Spielman came up with the idea of making Kwai Chang Caine ahalf-American, half-Chinese Shaolin monk. “That guy is me,” Spielman says. “ThatCaine character is me in a way, just like Siegel and Shuster did Superman. Hewas always Eurasian; he always didn’t fit in.” When it was finally done, theyentitled their treatment: The Way of the Tiger, The Sign of the Dragon.In 1969, Spielman and Friedlander submitted a portfolio of their jokes to PeterLampack, a young agent at William Morris. Into the middle of the packet,Spielman slipped their movie treatment about a Eurasian Shaolin monk, who roamedthe American West of the 1880s, righting wrongs with pacifist, Easternphilosophy and if that failed, kicking serious cowboy butt. “I didn’t think muchof the comedy material quite frankly,” Lampack recalls, “but I was quite takenwith their story of a half-Chinese, half-Caucasian boy, because it was acompletely fresh idea.”Fired up with youthful enthusiasm, Lampack tried and failed to generate interestinside William Morris. Undaunted, he took it out to market himself, pitching itto every studio and producer in Hollywood as a James Michener–type tale about anexotic locale that an American audience could understand. “I took fiftyrejections,” Lampack says. “I was young enough and idealistic enough not torealize that a mixed-race protagonist was not high on the list of priorities formost studios, because there was a substantial prejudice, then, in the UnitedStates, following World War II, and the immediate decades following—an anti-, ifnot an overt but subtle, anti-Oriental sentiment.”The only person to take an interest in the treatment was Fred Weintraub, aforty-one-year-old executive at Warner Bros. Formerly the owner of the GreenwichVillage nightclub the Bitter End, Weintraub was close friends with Ted Ashley.When Ashley was hired to revive Warner Bros., he put Weintraub in charge of adevelopment fund earmarked for countercultural, youth-appealing projects likeColumbia Pictures’ Easy Rider (1969). Weintraub’s first act was a million-dollarbet on a documentary about a music concert in upstate New York. Released March26, 1970, Woodstock: 3 Days of Peace and Music made so much money at the boxoffice it saved Warner Bros. from bankruptcy.One of his next projects was Spielman and Friedlander’s treatment for The Way ofthe Tiger, The Sign of the Dragon. “I liked the idea and gave the boys somethinglike $3,800 to write a screenplay,” recalls Weintraub. The boys turned in thescreenplay on April 30, 1970. As soon as Weintraub read it, he was sold. “Now Ijust had to sell the Warner Bros. honchos on the idea of a kung fu western,”Weintraub says.During a trip to L.A., he decided to study the source material for the script,whose lengthy title had been changed to a Chinese word hardly any American hadever heard before: Kung Fu. He camped out in the Warner’s vaults to watch “someof these Chinese ‘chop-socky’ films that were becoming popular in Asia, butwhich had so far gone little seen in America.” While underwhelmed by theirexecution, Weintraub was inspired by their potential. “For the most part, thefilms were a mess: unbearably long with incomprehensible stories,bargain-basement production values, and insipid, badly dubbed dialogue. But inthe last ten minutes of each film, there would be some kind of battle where asingle heroic martial arts master dressed in white would take on a swarm ofblack clad attackers and defeat them all with lightning fast kicks, flips, andpunches—knocking my socks off in the process.”Fred shared his enthusiasm for the potential of kung fu movies with his oldfriend Sy Weintraub (no relation). Sy, who had made a fortune producing theTarzan movies and TV series, was one of Bruce Lee’s private students. He toldFred he had to meet his young Chinese instructor. “That’s how I first came faceto face with Bruce Lee. Although chest to face would be more accurate, since at6'2\" I towered over the 5'7\" martial artist and sometime actor,” Weintraub says.“At the time I met Bruce I had never seen any of his TV work. To me he was justa sweet, bright, well-spoken young man, who was extremely knowledgeable abouthis craft—martial arts, not acting—and anxious to apply his skills to a moviecareer.”After chatting with Bruce, Weintraub realized he had found the perfect actor forthe difficult-to-cast part of Kwai Chang Caine, the Eurasian kung fu master.Several names had been floated in association with the project. Spielman’schoice was James Coburn. “He walked beautifully,” Spielman says. “He was kingfor a theatrical. I thought he would have been a slam dunk.” But it wasWeintraub’s project and he wanted Bruce. “We talked about it a lot,” Weintraubsays.For a brief moment, it was a go project on the verge of production—“They weregoing to take us to Durango, Mexico, for the Western scenes,” says Friedlander,“and Taiwan for the Chinese sequences”—until March 1, 1970, when Richard Zanuckand his partner, David Brown, were hired as senior executives at Warners. Aswith almost all Hollywood studio changeovers, the first thing these stepfathersdid was to dash against the rocks all the babies of any rival executives lestthey grow up into hits and their biological fathers take credit for theirsuccess. “It was Zanuck-Brown who came in, and they just canceled the project,”Friedlander says. “I’ll never forget that.” Despite his success with Woodstock,Weintraub couldn’t save Kung Fu. He appealed the decision all the way to thetop, but “even Ted Ashley, my best friend and head of the studio, passed on thefilm. The general consensus was that the public would not be willing to accept aChinese hero.” With one racist swipe, Kung Fu was cast down into DevelopmentHell, where previously promising projects are sent to torment the hopes anddreams of their creators.Image [../images/sec.jpg]With Kung Fu canceled, Fred Weintraub began looking for another project forBruce, whom he viewed as a special talent. The treatment for a film calledKelsey caught his eye. “It’s a story I loved. There’s a tribe called the Mandanin North Dakota and they had blue eyes. But some of them also looked Chinese,”Weintraub says. “I was trying to figure out something that might work for Bruce.I was crazy.”Set in 1792, the story is about a tall, rugged trapper (Kelsey) who is searchingfor a hidden path through the Dakota territories that, legend has it, runsthrough the lands of the Mandan people. In Act I, Kelsey is betrayed by aFrench-Canadian rival (Rousseau) and left for dead. He stumbles back to thetrading post and recruits an old military buddy (Woody) and a Chinese mercenary(Lee) to track down Rousseau. In Act II, they discover the Mandans, fightseveral ritualized challenge matches with their braves, and bed down for thewinter with several of their blue-eyed squaws. In Act III, Kelsey, Woody, andLee battle it out against Rousseau and his outlaws. In the final,countercultural twist (circa 1971), the three heroes refuse to return to thetrading post and choose to live with the Mandans instead.Kelsey is the primary source material for Enter the Dragon (1973). In Kelsey,Lee is Chinese, Kelsey is white, and his old buddy, Woody, is black. “I had theactor Woody Strode in mind,” Fred says. The three heroes in Enter the Dragon arealso white (Roper), black (Williams), and Chinese (Lee; conveniently the samename). And their interrelationships are also the same. In Enter the Dragon,Roper and Williams are old war buddies, while Lee is a warrior they have justmet.The difference is the hierarchy of the heroes. In Kelsey, Lee has 13 lines,Woody 31, and Kelsey 115. Not only is Lee not the lead, he’s not even the secondmost important character. Introduced as “an expert in the martial arts,” Lee’sfirst act is to bring Kelsey some tea. In other words, Lee is Kato—the nearlysilent kung fu expert and Asian manservant to the white hero. Weintraub believedin Bruce’s talent, but he still didn’t think a Chinese actor could carry aHollywood movie.In the end, it didn’t matter. Weintraub submitted the Kelsey screenplay toWarner’s honchos on March 26, 1971. It was returned with extensive notes. Asecond draft was submitted on April 28. Despite the changes, Kelsey was quicklyrejected. It was too weird even for Warner Bros. “God, I never got anywhere withit,” Weintraub says.Image [../images/sec.jpg]After the failure of Kelsey, Kung Fu, and, most heartbreakingly, The SilentFlute, Bruce became so disillusioned with Hollywood he started to lose faith. Hefelt helpless, unable to shape his own destiny. “He began to believe what wekept telling him, which is that you will never be a superstar,” says StirlingSilliphant. “You will always be: ‘Bruce Lee, stick around and we’ll keep workingyou into things.’ ” One day Bruce grabbed his six-year-old son, Brandon, andwarned him to never become an actor: “When you grow up, you are going to be thebiggest producer in Hollywood and you are going to call the shots and you willtell everybody who can be a star and who cannot be a star. No one is going totell you that because you are Chinese you cannot be a leading man.”Seeing his sifu’s frustration and worried he might abandon Hollywood, Silliphantdevised a new strategy to make Bruce Lee a movie star. “I thought if we got hima TV series of his own,” Silliphant says, “he could get very very hot and thatwould make the bridge into films.” An opportunity to put this plan into actionarrived when Tom Tannenbaum, the head of Paramount TV, hired Silliphant to adaptBaynard Kendrick’s mystery novels about Duncan Maclain, a blind privateinvestigator who worked with his German shepherd and his household of assistantsto solve murders. The plan was for the show, renamed Longstreet, to air thefirst two-hour episode as an ABC Movie of the Week and if audiences responded,turn it into an ongoing series.Bruce later claimed creative credit for the original idea, telling Mito Uyehara,“The idea of Longstreet indirectly came from me. I always had in mind thatsomeday I’d like to act in a movie in which I would be a blind fighter. Imentioned that to Silliphant several times and that’s how he got the idea ofusing a blind detective as the leading character. My idea came from the Japanesemovie, Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman.”Silliphant set up a lunch meeting between Lee and Tannenbaum on September 30,1970. Bruce clearly charmed Tannenbaum, because four days later he wrote in hisdaily planner, “Will Make TV series.”Silliphant didn’t try to make Bruce the star of Longstreet. Although he tookgreat liberties with the source material—about the only thing the TV show has incommon with the novels is that the lead character, renamed Mike Longstreet, is ablind detective—Silliphant didn’t turn Longstreet into a sightless Chinesefighter. He didn’t even work Bruce into the pilot TV movie. As with The SilentFlute, Silliphant didn’t believe Bruce was ready to carry a project yet. Inperson, Bruce had the charisma and raw energy of a potential star, but thatmagnetism hadn’t translated to the screen. His Kato was bland, his acting inMarlowe stiff. Bruce needed the right vehicle, but he also needed to dig deeperas an actor. He needed a breakout performance.After the Longstreet pilot movie aired on February 23, 1971, Tannenbaum orderedfour episodes to be filmed before the show’s premiere on September 16, 1971.Silliphant, who was the executive producer, decided to dedicate the thirdepisode to Bruce and his personal style of martial arts. He even went so far asto name the episode “The Way of the Intercepting Fist”—the English translationof Jeet Kune Do. His goal was to showcase Bruce’s talents in the best possiblelight as a calling card to help Bruce land his own TV show.Silliphant’s strategy was brilliant in its simplicity: he would have Bruce Leeplay Bruce Lee. Silliphant, with Bruce’s help, wrote the role of Li Tsung as anAsian antique dealer and kung fu master. Li Tsung ends up teaching kung fu toMike Longstreet, played by James Franciscus.In the opening of “The Way of the Intercepting Fist,” the blind Longstreet isattacked by three longshoremen who want to stop his inquiries into their theftsat the New Orleans port. Out of nowhere, Li Tsung (Bruce Lee) intercedes,dispatching the thugs with kung fu strikes and spinning back kicks.“What did you do to them?” Longstreet asks.“They did it to themselves,” Li Tsung responds.“Who are you?”“Li, Li Tsung,” he says in James Bond fashion and pats Longstreet on theshoulder. “May it be well with you.”When Longstreet asks Li Tsung to teach him this ancient art of ass-kicking, LiTsung refuses.“I’m willing to empty my cup in order to taste your tea,” Longstreet pleads.“Your open-mindedness is cool, but it doesn’t change anything. I don’t believein systems, Mr. Longstreet, nor in method. Without system, without method,what’s to teach?”Silliphant clearly had a blast writing this episode with Longstreet as hisstand-in. As he later said, “What I did was simply to take many of the thingsBruce had taught me and put them into the script.” After all those veryexpensive private lessons, Stirling must have been delighted that he could writethem off as a business expense.During Longstreet’s first session, Li Tsung pulls out a kicking shield and askshim to kick it. Then he hands the shield to Longstreet. “I want you to feel thedifference when I put my body behind it.” Li Tsung blasts Longstreet back fivefeet into a chair behind him, which he flips over landing head over heels.Longstreet’s friend Duke Paige (played by Peter Mark Richman), who has beenobserving skeptically, asks, “What is this thing you do?”Li Tsung launches into what amounts to a thinly veiled Jeet Kune Do infomercial.“In Cantonese, Jeet Kune Do, the Way of the Intercepting Fist. Come on touch meanywhere you can,” Li Tsung says and then sidekicks at Duke’s knee. “To reach meyou must move to me. Your attack offers me an opportunity to intercept you. Inthis case, I am using my longest weapon, my sidekick, against the nearesttarget, your kneecap. This can be compared to your left jab in boxing, except itis much more damaging.”Bruce is energized and dynamic throughout these training sequences, fullyembodying the character he had spent the last several years creating. In short,he’s a star. Bruce was not a method actor who becomes the roles he plays, but aclassic Hollywood leading man who turns every character into a version ofhimself. “I am a personality and each role I play shares a bit of thatpersonality,” Bruce later told the Hong Kong press. “I think the successfulingredient in it [Longstreet] was because I was being Bruce Lee. I was free toexpress myself.” He expanded on this point with another interviewer: “When Ifirst arrived [in Hollywood] I did The Green Hornet. As I looked around I saw alot of human beings, as I looked at myself I was the only robot there, because Iwas not being myself.”For the rest of the episode, Silliphant would often let Longstreet deliver someof Bruce’s favorite quotes. When, after much struggle, Longstreet finally does adecent kick, Li Tsung cries out in approval, “Yes! Now how did it feel to you?”“Like I didn’t kick. IT kicked,” Longstreet replies, uttering a line that Brucewould later repeat in Enter the Dragon—“When there is an opportunity, I do nothit. IT hits all by itself.”As Longstreet’s confidence grows, he decides to challenge the longshoreman whobeat him up to a rematch. He walks into their waterfront pub and lays down hischallenge: “I’m coming down to Pier 6 one week from today, twelve noon sharp,and I’m personally going to kick you in the river.”Li Tsung objects to Longstreet using his art for violent purposes and refuses tocontinue his lessons. “You have a quarrelsome mind, Mr. Longstreet. Unless youlearn to calm it you will never hear the world outside.”Longstreet appeals, “Li, I want you to believe it is more than just learning todefend myself. There were a couple of times there when you were teaching me thatI felt my body and my head really were together. It’s funny that out of amartial art, out of combat I’d feel something peaceful, something withouthostility, almost as though if I knew Jeet Kune Do, it would be enough simply toknow it and by knowing it never have to use it.”“Do you always know the right thing to say?” Li Tsung jokes, agreeing to preparehim for his challenge match with the longshoreman.As the day approaches, Longstreet desperately tries to cram years ofself-defense training into a few hours. When he complains that there is too muchfor him to remember, Li Tsung delivers Bruce Lee’s most famous line: “If you tryto remember you will lose. Empty your mind. Be formless, shapeless, like water.Now you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup; put it into a teapot, itbecomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or creep or drip or CRASH! Be water, myfriend.”Over the years, this “Be water, my friend” passage has become every Bruce Leefan’s favorite saying—his iconic tagline. After Longstreet aired, Bruce did atelevision interview with Pierre Berton, Canada’s top TV journalist. Since it isthe only TV interview with Lee still extant, every Bruce Lee documentary usesclips from it. During their chat, Berton asked Bruce, “Can you remember the keylines by Stirling Silliphant? You wrote there are some lines that express yourphilosophy. I don’t know if you remember them or not.” Bruce replies, “Oh, Iremember them. I said, ‘Empty your mind. Be formless, shapeless like water. Nowif you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup; you put water into a bottle, itbecomes the bottle; you put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, watercan flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.’ Like that, you see?” Since then,every Bruce Lee documentary edits out Berton’s prompting and presents just theportion where Bruce is saying “Empty your mind . . . ,” as if he were a Zenmystic and not an actor quoting a line written by an Oscar-winning screenwriter.In the final training sequence, the night before the big fight, Li Tsung tellsLongstreet he will never be ready unless he changes his attitude: “Like everyoneelse you want to learn the way to win but never to accept the way to lose. Toaccept defeat, to learn to die is to be liberated from it. So when tomorrowcomes you must free your ambitious mind and learn the art of dying.”Silliphant based this scene on one of his private lessons with Bruce. “He had merunning up to three miles a day,” Silliphant recalls. “So this morning he saidto me we’re going to go five. I said, ‘Bruce, I can’t go five. I’m a helluva lotolder than you are, and I can’t do five.’ He said, ‘When we get to three, we’llshift gears and it’s only two more, and you’ll do it.’ I said, ‘Okay, hell I’llgo for it.’ So we get to three, we go into the fourth mile, and I’m okay forthree or four minutes, and then I really begin to give out. I’m tired, myheart’s pounding, I can’t go anymore and so I say to him, ‘Bruce if I runanymore,’ and we’re still running, ‘if I run anymore I’m liable to have a heartattack and die.’ He said, ‘Then die.’ It made me so mad that I went the fullfive miles.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]As with Marlowe, Bruce also served as the fight coordinator on the Longstreetepisode. “Bruce was the advisor and would suggest whatever had to be done,” saysPeter Mark Richman. “He was not just a guy who hung around doing nothing but wasalways working out.”While shooting the episode from June 21 to July 1, 1971, Bruce also establisheda daily class to instruct the entire crew in Jeet Kune Do. “Bruce Lee was nextdoor teaching Karate during the Longstreet episodes. All the actors went tostudy with him. He was in incredible shape and very popular. He would do splitsabove the ground by putting his legs on one desk and another with nothingunderneath, all kinds of incredible things,” says Louis Gossett Jr., who playedSergeant Cory. (It was so unusual to have both an Asian American and an AfricanAmerican actor cast in prominent roles on a TV show that The New York Timesreview made a point of mentioning it: “The Chinaman lends a deft touch ofexotica. . . . The police detective, played by Lou Gossett, is black.”) JamesFranciscus was particularly grateful for Lee’s instruction: “Bruce taught meenough basics so I looked like I knew what I was doing. I really didn’t,but . . .”In keeping with the show’s theme, Bruce not only gave physical lessons to theactors but also offered philosophical teaching. Marlyn Mason, who played MikeLongstreet’s assistant, Nikki Bell, remembers Bruce’s wisdom fondly: “He wasjust the dearest man. He changed my life in three words. He said to me, ‘Don’tsay a word, just listen and think about it.’ And I listened, and he said, ‘Whatis, “is.” ’ I thought, ‘That’s pretty simple,’ but I didn’t say anything. Ibegan to think about it, and I don’t think there’s a day that passes that Idon’t think about him because it literally changed my life.”Peter Mark Richman was less impressed. When asked what he thought Bruce wastrying to put across on the show, he answered, “It was kind of horseshitphilosophy. The writer Stirling Silliphant had the idea he would be someone whowas knowledgeable in Eastern philosophy.” Marlyn’s and Peter’s differingreactions reflect the split people had to Bruce’s philosophizing. Some found himprofound; others thought it was a marketing gimmick. It is entirely possiblethat it was a little bit of both. Bruce was very serious about philosophy butfor someone as self-aware as he was, he had to realize the benefit it added tohis persona in an era where the Beatles were learning Transcendental Meditationat Indian ashrams.Image [../images/sec.jpg]The quality actors appreciate most in their colleagues is the ability to listenand react. These are skills Bruce still lacks in Longstreet. Whenever he is in ascene where the other actors are talking and he is not the center of attention,he looks visibly uncomfortable. But in the Jeet Kune Do lessons where he is incharge and the scene is all about him, he absolutely dominates. You can’t takeyour eyes off him. It is the difference between a character actor and a star.Longstreet was Bruce Lee’s breakout performance, the moment he began to realizehis potential as a screen performer. He still had work to do, but the momentswhen Bruce Lee was being “Bruce Lee” are electric.With a loving eye, Silliphant had finally managed to capture on-screen what hadso captivated him about Bruce in real life. And his plan to use this episode asa calling card to get Bruce his own show looked well on its way to success. Theexcitement inside Paramount over the episode was palpable. On July 10, 1971,Bruce wrote to a friend to share the good news: “Finished shooting‘Longstreet’—be sure to watch it in Sept. I did a good job on it. In fact, TomTannenbaum, head of Paramount’s TV department, has just contacted me for adevelopment of a TV series for me. Also, he wants me to be a recurring characterin Paramount’s ‘Longstreet.’ This happens so fast I don’t know what tothink—must have done a good job!? Well, what more can I say but that things areswinging my way.”"},{"pageContent":"ACT IIITHE RETURNED“In this world there are only two tragedies.

On thismorning in mid-March 1970, his initial impulse was to curse them for waking himup so early, but being a professional charmer he quickly agreed, not realizingits significance. Afterward he told his friend Mito Uyehara, “Do you know wespent a full hour on the phone from Hong Kong to my house? Boy, that call musthave cost them a mint. But it serves them right for waking me up so early. Canyou imagine me talking to thousands of people way over there. I think it’s thefirst time any radio station has done that.”Mito asked, “What did you talk about?”“Nothing important,” Bruce answered. “I really don’t know why he wanted to talkto me. First, he asked me if I’m gonna go back to Hong Kong and I said, ‘Soon.’Then he asked me if I’m doing any movie right now, and if I ever planned to doone in Hong Kong. I told him that I would if the price is right. You know, myChinese is pretty lousy now, but hell, if it’s good enough for a disc jockey,it’s good enough for the listeners.”A week later Bruce was scheduled to make a short trip to Hong Kong. He hadn’tvisited the colony in over five years. The purpose of his visit was to arrange avisa for his mother to live in America. She was getting older and wanted to becloser to the majority of her children—Robert, Agnes, and Phoebe lived in SanFrancisco and Bruce was in Los Angeles, while only Peter remained in Hong Kong.On March 27, 1970, Bruce landed in Kai Tak Airport with five-year-old Brandon.As surprised as he was by the live radio interview, the reception he receivedupon exiting the plane came as a complete shock. A throng of reporters waswaiting. Bruce assumed there must be some big shot on the plane with him, untilhe heard a chorus calling his name, “Mr. Lee! Mr. Lee!”  The press cornered himand asked him the same questions he’d been asked by the disc jockey. Bewildered,Bruce politely answered and agreed to pose with two actresses flanking him oneither side while photographers snapped away.“Shit, I didn’t know what was going on,” he told Mito afterward. “But I ain’tgriping. I never had so much attention since the Green Hornet days. It’s goodfor my ego. I couldn’t believe that one hour over the radio had made me somekind of celebrity in Hong Kong.”It took him several hours to discover the real reason for all the attention. TheGreen Hornet had recently aired on Hong Kong TV and had become so popular withlocals they nicknamed it The Kato Show. “After I found out, it finally dawned onme as to why the interview over the radio and why the crowd was there. My momhad told the papers about my coming and they printed it. Green Hornet was a bighit with the people there,” Bruce happily recounted, “and they kept replaying itfor months. When I first saw it, I couldn’t stop laughing especially watchingVan [Williams] speaking Chinese. It was funny! I guess I’m the only guy whoventured away from there and became an actor. To most people, including theactors and actresses, Hollywood is like a magic kingdom. It’s beyond everyone’sreach and when I made it, they thought I’d accomplished an incredible feat.”The prodigal son had returned as the hometown hero made good. Everybody wanted apiece of him. “I had a good time even if it was very hectic. My mom’s place wasbombarded constantly by the guys from TV and the newspapers,” Bruce said. “Theycame not just for me. My mom for the first time in her life got her share ofpublicity, too. She really dug it.”The biggest request came from the late night talk show, Enjoy YourselfTonight—Hong Kong’s version of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. For thefirst fifteen minutes, the host and Bruce joked around. After years practicingwith the American media, Bruce was at his best—relaxed, charming, irreverent.“Talk shows like that are easy to do,” Bruce said afterward. “You don’t have tomemorize anything and can joke all night. There’s no seriousdiscussions—everything is light.”After the interview portion, Bruce gave one of his well-honed kung fudemonstrations. He was eager to show off all he had learned since leaving home.He did some two-finger push-ups. With a leaping kick, he snapped in half fourone-inch boards suspended from the ceiling by a rope—a particularly difficultstunt. While the crowd was still howling with applause, Bruce led five-year-oldBrandon out, and he broke some boards too. Now the Chinese crowd, who adorechildren, went wild. Just as Bruce’s father had him acting in a movie by the ageof two months, Bruce was introducing his young son to the family business.For the grand finale, two assistants were brought out. “The station was sothrilled to get me, they asked me if I needed anything,” Bruce recalled. “All Iasked for, and got, were two karate black belts.” Bruce asked one karate guy tohold on to a kicking shield and directed the other black belt to stand behindhim, explaining that if the kick knocked his partner backward, he should grabhim. “The stage was small but I felt it was enough to generate some power in mykick,” Bruce recounted with relish. “I had to stand less than five feet away,but I kicked that mother perfectly, lifting that guy off his feet, driving himback hard. The second guy didn’t expect the guy to fly at him and didn’t bracehimself. But even if he were ready, no way he could have stopped him. That guywas going too fast. You should have seen the expression of all the people. Itwas funny when the guys crashed into the props, knocked everything down. Thestagehands were all shook up and ran all over the place trying to get the propsback. But the two guys on the floor made me laugh the most. They were soshocked; they had the dumbest look on their faces. Man, the whole place was acomical mess.”Hong Kong audiences had watched countless kung fu demonstrations, but they hadnever seen anything quite like this before. And they had never seen anyone quitelike Bruce on their TV screens—his charisma, his energy, or his swagger, whichhe had honed from close study of Steve McQueen, the King of Cool. “He was solifelike, even on the screen,” recalls Michael Hui, one of Bruce’s classmatesfrom La Salle. “He looked like he could step out from the television into yourliving room.” What Chinese audiences were used to seeing were stiff contractactors dressed up and sent out to mouth the studio line under threat ofpunishment if they strayed. What they saw in Bruce was a free man, unshackled ofany institution or even, seemingly, the constraints of two thousand years ofConfucianism. “He was a very straightforward, very Westernized, very gung-ho,can-do spirit,” says Ang Lee, director of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.“Unlike the repressed Chinese zigzagging attitude.”Bruce Lee was something new. And no one recognizes the new faster than children.The most important kid watching the show that night turned out to be David Lo,the son of director Lo Wei. As Bruce was joking in the interview, David ran intothe other room to grab his father. Lo Wei, who worked for Golden HarvestStudios, was impressed with what he saw. Afterward he called his boss, RaymondChow, and suggested he watch it. Bruce might be someone worth pursuing. It tookChow a week or two to get a copy of the episode. “Not only was I very impressedby his technique and great form, I was most taken by his eyes,” recalls Chow.“Those eyes could express so much intensity.”Raymond viewed Bruce as an interesting prospect, an actor with enough potentialto be worth giving a tryout. He tried to track Bruce down, but it was too late.Bruce had already returned to America on April 16, 1970. For the moment, RaymondChow would have to continue his bitter fight against Run Run Shaw, Hong Kong’slast movie mogul, without the assistance of Bruce Lee.Image [../images/sec.jpg]In the decade since Bruce moved to America, Hong Kong’s movie landscape hadcompletely transformed. In the 1950s, it was a tiny cottage industry with ahandful of bigger studios and dozens of independent production companies. By1970, it was dominated by one man, Run Run Shaw.Born on November 23, 1907, near Shanghai, Run Run was the sixth of sevenchildren of a wealthy textile merchant who owned an old vaudeville hall. Run Runand his two older brothers, Run Me and Run Je, were more excited by thepossibilities of the entertainment industry than textiles and decided to turnthe theater around by staging their own plays. Run Je wrote a Robin Hood–stylemelodrama, Man from Shanxi, and staged it in the dilapidated hall. On openingnight the lead actor plunged through the rotten planks of the stage, and theaudience laughed, thinking it was intentional. The boys took notice and rewrotethe script to include the pratfall as a stunt. They had a hit, and in 1924 theyturned Man from Shanxi into their first film.As mainland China became increasingly unstable in the 1930s, the brothersdecided to move their operation to Singapore. “We were more interested indistribution than in filmmaking,” Run Run remembers. “We bought one movietheater and then expanded our interests in that direction until we owned 120theaters in Singapore and Malaysia alone.”  Their string of cinemas became knownas the Mandarin Circuit, snaking from Hong Kong through Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos,Thailand, Burma, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, Indonesia, andWestern cities with large Chinese communities like San Francisco.When the Japanese overran Singapore on February 15, 1942, the Shaw brothers weremore prepared for the ensuing disaster than the British Army. They had alreadyliquidated most of their assets and buried more than $4 million in gold,jewelry, and currency in their backyard. After Singapore was liberated, they dugup their hidden treasure and used it to reestablish their empire. “The pearlswere a little brown, the watches rusty, the banknotes mildewed, but the gold wasnice and yellow,” Run Run Shaw recalled. “We were still rich.”Having secured a virtual monopoly on theatrical distribution, the brothersturned their sights to content. With the fall of mainland China to theCommunists, Hong Kong was now the movie capital of the Chinese-speaking world.Run Run moved there in 1957 to expand the family’s empire. In 1961, two yearsafter Bruce Lee was sent to America, he completed his studio on a windy hilloverlooking Hong Kong’s Clearwater Bay. He named it Movietown, and it was thelargest privately owned studio in the world. The forty-six-acre lot was acompletely self-contained operation. All Shaw Bros. films were planned, written,acted, directed, cut, dubbed, and dispatched from one of the ten studios,sixteen outdoor sets, and three sound rooms. Film was processed in the Movietownlaboratory; sets were built in the Movietown factory. Nothing was purchased thatcould be manufactured; nothing manufactured was used only once.The same was true of its actors. Like MGM and other golden-era Hollywoodstudios, Movietown had its own acting academy, the Southern Dramatic School,which taught aspiring thespians how to dance, kiss, and fight. Thousandsapplied, a few hundred were accepted; and of those, only one out of fiftygraduates was offered an ironclad Shaw Bros. contract. Once signed, Run Run’spower over the house actors would have made Darryl Zanuck choke on his cigar inenvy. The contract lasted up to six years with a base pay of $200 per monthwithout any fringe or medical benefits. Actors and actresses had no say overscripts, directors, or costars. Almost all had to live in Movietown’s high-riseconcrete dormitories. Fraternization between the sexes, drunkenness, and drugswere strictly forbidden on pain of unemployment. About the only way to break thecontract was to quit the profession or the country.With his monopoly on distribution and lock on cut-rate talent, Run Run beganpumping out movies, more than forty per year—overwhelming independent producers.“The Chinese film industry was at its lowest level then,” Run Run explained.“Films were made in seven or ten days and were of very poor quality and theturnover was small. I held to the idea that in this part of the world where theChinese population is so large, there had to be a market for quality films.”While Run Run’s films were of higher quality, the real key to his success waswhat he had learned as a boy when the audience laughed at the actor who fellthrough the rotten stage planks: The customer is always right. Unlike thedidactic social message movies of Bruce’s childhood in the 1950s, Shaw’s filmspushed no political agenda. “If they want violence, we give them violence. Ifthey want sex, we give them sex,” Run Run declared as his corporate missionstatement. “Whatever the audience wants, we will give them. I particularly likemovies that make money.”Having studied moviegoers from the perspective of a theater owner, Run Runconcluded, “Every type of film has its period of popularity. After some time,people get tired of the same sort of film.” When Run Run arrived in 1957,musicals were hot and starred effete romantic male leads. Then in late 1964, thefickle public’s affection shifted to the bloody Japanese samurai movies(chambara). Run Run quickly began churning out his own savage sword-fightingcopies (wuxia), filled with vengeful superheroes able to leap, somersault, andlevitate in defiance of gravity. “Sometimes we do overdo [the violence] alittle, especially in the sword movies,” Run Run admitted. “But actually, theChinese audience, and in fact most other audiences, love violence.”The popularity of wuxia sword-fighting films declined in 1968 after CommunistChina’s premier, Chou En-lai, declared that Japan was the new imperialist forcein the East. Suddenly it became unfashionable to imitate samurai films. As hehad done before, Run Run Shaw turned on a dime. With Chinese nationalism as thenew trend, Shaw Bros. simply switched to the uniquely Chinese art of kung fu.Hong Kong cinema had a deep tradition of kung fu movies; the most popular ofwhich was the long-running Wong Fei-hung film series. Shaw Bros. revived thistradition with a distinctly anti-Japanese twist to suit the mood of the timeswith The Chinese Boxer (1970)—the first major movie to devote itself entirely tothe art of kung fu.The idea for The Chinese Boxer originated with Hong Kong’s biggest male actionstar and Shaw academy graduate, Jimmy Wang Yu, who wrote, directed, and starredin it. “That picture was my idea, and I made the script. I am the leading actor,because I had a good idea,” Jimmy says. “Everybody said karate was so powerfuland Chinese kung fu is so powerful, why don’t you put them into one film?” Inthe movie, Wang Yu plays a kung fu student whose teacher is killed by Japanesekarate fighters. Wang Yu’s character dons a mask and challenges the Japanese tocombat, defeating them in a series of bloody duels to the death with his “IronPalm” technique. The resulting felicitous combination of ethnic chauvinism andtraditional kung fu was a smash hit at the box office, becoming the second mostpopular Chinese movie in Hong Kong history. Its success marked the switch fromsupernatural wuxia sword-fighting films to the body-centric unarmed combat ofkung fu movies—setting the stage for Bruce Lee’s rise to fame.Bruce was well aware of The Chinese Boxer. He attended a special screening inL.A.’s Chinatown with Steve McQueen and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Victor Lam, aChinese producer who attended the screening with them, claims, “From watchingWang Yu, Bruce learned how to show off his technique on film.” While it isdebatable if Wang Yu, whose athletic background was swimming, had anything toteach Lee about kung fu choreography, Jimmy’s success seems to have triggeredBruce’s hypercompetitive nature. Just as Bruce dreamed of replacing SteveMcQueen as Hollywood’s biggest box office star, he would soon try to eclipseJimmy Wang Yu in Hong Kong. Anything Jimmy had done first, Bruce set out to dobigger and better.But before that could come to pass, Shaw’s grip on the Hong Kong film industryhad to be broken. By the end of the 1960s, Run Run had achieved a near monopolyon Chinese film production by defeating his main rival, Cathay Films. Facing noexternal enemies, all seemed secure. It was a trusted lieutenant that endedShaw’s empire.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Raymond Chow graduated with a journalism degree from Shanghai’s St. John’sUniversity in 1949, the same year Mao Zedong and his Communist revolutionariestook over the country. Wisely predicting that the new government wouldn’t beparticularly hospitable to an independent press, Raymond, along with most ofShanghai’s creative talent, fled to Hong Kong, where he worked as a cub reporterfor the newly launched Hong Kong Tiger Standard. The pay was so low he had totake up part-time work to survive. “At one time I was holding down seven jobs,”Chow says.In 1951, Chow took a better-paying job at Hong Kong’s Voice of America office,which was the propaganda arm in America’s war against Communism in Asia. TheUnited States had backed the strongman Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek against MaoZedong in China’s civil war. When the Generalissimo lost and fled to Taiwan,America established its rearguard operations in Hong Kong. Raymond was hired toset up the Mandarin-language broadcasting program for Voice of America.In 1958, he decided to transfer the skills he had acquired as an American spindoctor to the job of head of publicity for Shaw Brothers Studio. Movie marketingproved to be even more dishonest work than government propaganda. Two months in,Raymond told Run Run he was resigning because he couldn’t sell the dreck ShawBros. was making. Impressed by his nerve, Run Run said to the young publicist,“You think you can do a better job? I’ll make you head of production.”Along with his partner, Leonard Ho, Raymond Chow had a strong run. He was theone who signed off on Jimmy Wang Yu’s The Chinese Boxer. “I showed the script toMr. Raymond Chow,” Jimmy says. “He let me try it. Actually, Mr. Run Run Shawdidn’t bother his mind about it.”By the late 1960s, Shaw Bros. was facing the same existential threat that nearlybankrupted several American movie studios—color television. Cinema attendancebegan declining at the same time costs were increasing. Run Run—being the kindof tough businessman who would pull the gold out of your teeth and charge youfor doing it—decided to shift toward television, downsize movies, and reduceproduction budgets. “Shaw was thinking of cutting down the operations and usinghalf of the manpower and capital to go into television,” says Raymond. “I didn’tquite agree with that.”Raymond offered Run Run a deal. He would set up a production company, GoldenHarvest, under the umbrella of Shaw Brothers Studio. Golden Harvest would makehalf its movies, Shaw Bros. would be the distributor, and they would split theprofits. Since Golden Harvest’s movies would be pushed through Shaw’s chain ofmovie theaters, Run Run could downsize production, and Raymond didn’t need to gointo sales and distribution.Even though Golden Harvest was part of Shaw Bros., the new production companystill had to compete internally with Shaw’s old movie division for talent. Asthe former head of production, Raymond knew when everybody’s ironclad contractswith Shaw Bros. were about to expire. He went around quietly whispering in thebest directors’ and actors’ ears that they should not renew with Shaw, theyshould move to Golden Harvest instead. Since he didn’t have any money of hisown, Raymond promised them a percentage of the profits.Several of the directors Raymond secretly approached went back to Run Run andsaid, “My contract is about to expire, and you better give me a better deal thanI’m getting from Golden Harvest.” Run Run confronted Raymond about stealing hisbest talent. Raymond denied it. “No, don’t be ridiculous.” Although stillsuspicious, Run Run believed Raymond, whose nickname was the Smiling Tiger.There the matter might have rested if not for one man—Jimmy Wang Yu.The success of The Chinese Boxer had made Jimmy Wang Yu the colony’s biggest boxoffice star and number one heartthrob. Jimmy wanted to join Golden Harvest andget a share of his box office success, but he still had several years on hiscontract with Shaw Bros. To solve this dilemma, Jimmy decided he would publiclybreak with Run Run. Raymond tried to dissuade him, but Jimmy went ahead with hisplan. Shaw was furious. Feeling betrayed by his most trusted protégé, Run Runcanceled the deal with Golden Harvest, fired two of Raymond’s top lieutenants,forced Raymond to come to the office for another week before firing him too, andfinally for good measure sacked a few other innocent executives just toemphasize his point: rebellion would not be tolerated.Meanwhile, Jimmy Wang Yu fled to Taiwan. To cut off any income and force him toreturn, Run Run sought an injunction from a Taiwanese court and took outadvertisements in the local press warning producers that Jimmy could not legallywork.Raymond, on the street and broke, turned to everyone and anyone who had an axeto grind with Run Run Shaw—not a short list. Most significant was Shaw’s oldnemesis Cathay Films. They gave Raymond their abandoned, barnlike productionstudio with soundstages, built initially to house a modest textile mill, perchedprecariously on a hilltop on Hammer Hill Road. In three short months, Raymondraised enough money to open Golden Harvest for business.It wasn’t great business. Shaw Bros. still controlled the best movie theaters onthe Mandarin Circuit; Golden Harvest had to make do with second-run dives. RunRun was able to keep most of his A-list directors. The best Raymond could poachwas Lo Wei, a competent, if not particularly brilliant, craftsman, who wouldlater direct Bruce’s first two movies. Golden Harvest’s top star, Jimmy Wang Yu,was still under contract with Shaw Bros. and could not legally work for anybodyelse in Hong Kong. So Raymond sent Jimmy to Japan to make a movie with Japan’stop action hero, star of the Zatoichi Blind Swordsman films, and Bruce Lee’sfavorite actor, Shintaro Katsu. The movie they co-produced was Zatoichi Meetsthe One-Armed Swordsman (1971).The problem was the One-Armed Swordsman was a valuable Shaw Brothers property.Jimmy Wang Yu had already played the role for Shaw Bros. in the hit films TheOne-Armed Swordsman (1967) and Return of the One-Armed Swordsman (1969). “Thatwas salt in the wound,” says Andre Morgan, who worked for Golden Harvest,“because it confirmed to Run Run that Raymond was the Benedict Arnold of Chineseshowbiz.” Run Run sued Golden Harvest for copyright infringement, fullyintending to bleed Raymond’s start-up studio dry with legal fees.To sum up, money was tight, distribution was tough, his talent pool was shallow,his biggest star was a wanted man, and he was facing the legal wrath of themonopoly studio in town. Raymond Chow was a man in desperate need of a savior.Image [../images/sec.jpg]After Bruce’s departure from Hong Kong in late April 1970, Raymond Chow was ableto track down his phone number in L.A. Bruce was surprised to get the call. Hedidn’t know Chow, but he had heard of him. They started chatting and seemed tohit it off. Raymond asked him if he would consider making a movie in Hong Kong.As with the radio interview, Bruce joked, “If the money is right.”  Theycontinued talking, but Bruce mostly focused on all the current Hollywoodprojects he was working on. It was apparent he wasn’t particularly interested inChow’s offer. Bruce was fully committed to The Silent Flute.A year later on April 10, 1971, Bruce called Raymond back. The Silent Flute,Kung Fu, and Kelsey had collapsed. He couldn’t make his mortgage payments. Hisback injury was still bothering him. He needed the money.“What is your best film, do you think?” Bruce asked Raymond.“I like most of my own films. I won’t say they are the best. Looking back I canalways find something to improve,” Raymond replied, “but I’m happy.”“What about Jimmy Wang Yu’s The Chinese Boxer?” Bruce asked.“That is one of the most successful action pictures we have ever made.”“I can do better,” Bruce asserted.“Oh really?” Raymond said, charmed.“Yes, if you really want to make good kung fu films you should . . . ,” Brucesaid and proceeded to explicate all the things he would do differently.“Yes, yes,” Raymond placated. “But if you help me, together, I am sure, we canbuild something.” Feeling positive about the conversation, Raymond concluded bysaying, “Well, I’ll send somebody over to sign a contract with you.”“You are not coming?” Bruce asked, slightly taken aback.“Well, I’m busy with other things. You know, since we agree on most things onthe phone, I’ll send a producer over to see you.”They may have agreed on many things, but Bruce wasn’t certain he really wantedto sign a contract with Golden Harvest, a struggling studio with finances asshaky as his own. With an offer from Raymond Chow on the table, Bruce decided toapproach Chow’s mortal enemy, Run Run Shaw. He reached out to his childhoodacting friend, Unicorn Chan, who worked for Shaw Bros., for an introduction.“Unicorn and Bruce wrote letters in the 60s and brought up the idea of himcoming back,” says Bruce’s brother Robert.Bruce sent Unicorn a letter, in a mixture of English and Chinese, to give to RunRun Shaw stating his interest and his stipulations. “Bruce made three demands,”recalls Unicorn Chan: “(1) The salary be US$10,000 per movie, (2) He must havethe right to make changes in any script given to him, and (3) He must have totalcontrol over fight choreography.” For an unproven and relatively unknown movieactor, it was an aggressive opening bid. “Bruce Lee wanted too much money to doa film with us,” explains Lawrence Wong, a producer with Shaw Bros. “Because ifwe paid him, we would then have to upgrade all of our other contract starsaccordingly.”After some internal debate, Run Run’s counteroffer was $5,000 per movie withoutany mention of script approval or fight choreography control. Linda says thatBruce laughed when he saw the reply, but he didn’t reject the offer outright. Hewired Shaw to ask about his two ignored stipulations. For Bruce, having controlover the quality of the final product was more important than the money. RunRun’s paternalistic reply was, “Just tell him to come back here and everythingwill be alright.”  This made Bruce furious. He might be broke, but he was a freeman and wouldn’t be owned by Run Run Shaw.If Raymond Chow wasn’t Bruce Lee’s first choice, Bruce wasn’t Raymond’s firstdraft pick either. At the time, Bruce wasn’t anything more to Raymond than aninteresting prospect, a charming guy with some impressive kung fu skills who hadappeared as the chauffeur in a mediocre American TV show four years ago. Theperson he really wanted to sign was Hong Kong’s most famous female action star,the actress Cheng Pei Pei—the “Queen of the Swords.” She had achieved stardom asa swordswoman in King Hu’s Come Drink with Me (1966). According to Hong Kongmovie lore, Run Run Shaw grew extremely fond of his leading lady, but sheresisted his advances. This only stoked his ardor and he pursued her even moreintently. To escape his clutches, Cheng Pei Pei first fled to Taiwan and thenlater to Los Angeles where she got married. To Raymond Chow, not only was ChengPei Pei a bankable star, unlike Bruce Lee, but adding her, along with Jimmy WangYu, to his stable would be a coup in his war with Run Run Shaw.The producer sent to bring her back was Liu Liang Hwa (Gladys to her friends). Aformer actress herself, Gladys was the wife of director Lo Wei. While Gladys wasin L.A., she stayed at Cheng Pei Pei’s house. Bruce, the prospect, was invitedover to visit. “Bruce would come to our house to pick up Gladys. He had quitelong hair and always smelled of incense,” Cheng Pei Pei recalls, using thepolite euphemism for pot smoke. “My husband thought Bruce was a bit of a hippy!”Gladys was unable to sign Cheng Pei Pei. She wasn’t ready to return to moviesyet, although she would eventually have a long and varied career, including therole of Jade Fox in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000). And it was notentirely certain when Gladys returned to Hong Kong if Bruce would sign either.Raymond was offering more money than Shaw—$15,000 for a two-picture deal. But itwas risky going with a shaky start-up. Golden Harvest could go bankrupt beforethe films were even made or Raymond might refuse to pay up or the movies couldturn out to be so terrible that Bruce would regret appearing in them.Bruce consulted with Stirling Silliphant to solicit his advice.“Don’t take this,” Silliphant said. “Don’t go.”“I need the money,” Bruce replied.“Look, if you are going to do it, ask for the money up front and insist on afirst-class round-trip ticket,” Silliphant argued. “I don’t have to tell youabout Chinese producers. You’re going to get over there, and you’re not going toget your money and no return ticket and you’re not going to be able to get home.You’ll be stuck and your family is here.”“No, I trust Raymond Chow,” Bruce said, “and I will be back.”On June 28, 1971, Bruce signed with Golden Harvest to make two films: The BigBoss and King of the Chinese Boxers (later changed to Fist of Fury). Once theywere finished he intended to return. Contrary to popular myth, Bruce had notgiven up on Hollywood. Despite his many recent disappointments, the positiveexperience of Longstreet had reignited his optimism about his future careerprospects in America. He even believed he could resuscitate the Silent Fluteproject. Two days before his departure, he wrote to a friend, “Am leaving forH.K. this Sunday morning to do two features. Will be there for 4 months. When Icome back I’ll be busy with the possible shooting of Silent Flute, a movie (withFred Weintraub), and the TV series we will be working with Paramount during my 4months stay in Hong Kong.”Bruce did not hold out great hopes for the two Golden Harvest movies he wasabout to make. Before he signed the contract, Bruce prepared by watching a wholebunch of Hong Kong kung fu movies. “They were awful,” Bruce said. “It ispossible to act and fight at the same time, but most Chinese films have beenvery superficial and one dimensional.” While he was certain he could do better,Bruce did not expect that these two flicks would have any effect on hisHollywood career. His deal with Raymond Chow was not part of his career path buta momentary side trip to resupply his depleted bank account. He signed the dealfor the money. It was as simple as that."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f0306-01.jpg]Throwing down the Big Boss, played by Han Ying-Chieh, in The Big Boss, August1971.

By the time he signed Golden Harvest’s two-page contract on June 28,1971, preproduction had already begun on The Big Boss, and James Tien, who wasbeing groomed as the Next Big Thing, was already cast in the lead. Raymond Chowoffered to produce a different film specifically for Bruce, but he couldn’tafford to wait. Chow reluctantly agreed to shoehorn him into the movie.As soon as Bruce finished filming the “Way of the Intercepting Fist” episode ofLongstreet he gave Linda $50—all the cash he had left after paying off olddebts—and hopped on a Pan Am flight headed for Hong Kong on July 12. RaymondChow had wanted Bruce to fly directly to Thailand, where The Big Boss was beingfilmed, to avoid a layover in Hong Kong, because Chow was afraid Run Run Shawmight try to poach Bruce from Golden Harvest. “Bruce refused; he was determinedto stamp his authority on his productions from the outset insofar as wasreasonable. It wasn’t a question of ego; it was a question of making it clearfrom the outset that he was his own man,” Linda says. “He stayed at the airportonly long enough to greet a friend and to show he was not going to be movedaround like a pawn.”After this display of independence, Bruce flew on to Bangkok where he stayed fora few days before being driven on July 18 to Pak Chong, a tiny, impoverishedvillage on the edge of a national park. For a city boy like Bruce, it was asteep descent from Bel Air to Pak Chong. He wrote to his wife in the first offourteen homesick letters: “The mosquitos are terrible and cockroaches are allover the place. . . . The food is terrible, this village has no beef and verylittle chicken and pork. Am I glad I came with my vitamins. . . . I miss you alot but Pak Chong is no place for you and the children. It’s an absoluteunderdeveloped village and a big nothing.” His weight dropped from 145 pounds to128. To try to maintain his energy, he popped so many vitamin pills a rumor wentaround—and made its way into the tabloid press—that Bruce was on drugsthroughout the shoot.The gravest danger he faced was not, however, from nature but from man. The castand crew were equal parts envious and resentful. Most were friends with JamesTien, and it appeared that Bruce had been brought in from Hollywood to steal hisspotlight. If anyone remembered the Little Dragon, it was from theblack-and-white weepies he made as a child where he played a spunky orphan. TheBig Boss was to be a violent action flick. It would be as if Macaulay Culkindisappeared after Home Alone and then showed up as an adult to play JasonBourne. Then there was the issue of Bruce’s salary. The budget for the entirefilm was less than US$100,000. The rest of the actors were making at most $400.Bruce was being paid $7,500. The only bigger line item in the budget was forfake blood. “We heard that they’d spent all this money on Bruce Lee and we weregoing, ‘Who is this guy?’ ” remembers Zebra Pan, a stuntman for Golden Harvest.Before he had a chance to win over his colleagues, Bruce had to deal with thedirector, Wu Chia-Hsiang, who had already been filming James Tien’s scenes for aweek. Wanting to see what all the fuss and money was about, Wu Chia-Hsiang threwhim into a fight scene against the Big Boss’s underlings. Director Wu wantedBruce to engage in extended routines of punches, blocks, kicks, sweeps, locks,throws, and acrobatic flips. Hong Kong kung fu movies drew their fightchoreography from Cantonese Opera, which often had combat scenes of fiftyseparate movements or more.But unlike the stuntmen on set, Bruce had never studied Cantonese Opera. He wasprimarily a street fighter. He viewed traditional kung fu fight choreography asstaid and unrealistic. It was the old way, the way of his father; Bruce was thenew. When facing three opponents, Bruce wanted to crescent kick one to the head,spinning hook kick another, and roundhouse kick the third with each kick aknockout blow—a whirling dervish of destruction. “In Mandarin movies, everybodyfights all the time, and what really bothered me was that they all foughtexactly the same way,” Bruce complained. “Wow, nobody’s really like that!”Director Wu was aghast. Chinese audiences expected long, elaborate fight scenes;they didn’t want realism. He believed Bruce was a con man—he only knew threekicks! Director Wu, who came up in the Chinese movie system where the directorwas the Big Boss and the actors were the factory workers who were expected toobey, told Bruce to give him more action: “I want you to fight more. I wantaction. This is not enough.” Bruce, who came up in the Hollywood star system ofSteve McQueen, told Director Wu he would direct his own fight scenes.At an impasse, they both called Raymond Chow in Hong Kong.“This director is rubbish,” Bruce said. “When I fight these underlings, I shouldget rid of them with three kicks. If it takes a long time to dispatch thesepeons, then what should I do when I meet the head villain? I’ll have to fighthim for a whole hour.”“You’ve been swindled,” Director Wu complained to Chow. “You told me this guywas very good, but he can’t fight. All he knows are three kicks. I call him‘Three Leg Lee.’ ”Both sides had a point. Having lived in the East and West, Bruce wanted tobridge the gap. On The Green Hornet, he saw the excessive use of the John Waynepunch as boring and knew he could excite an audience by spicing it up withkicks. Bruce made Western fight choreography more complicated. But when hewatched the Chinese films, he realized they needed to be simpler. They were sointricate that they lacked any realism and therefore any sense of danger orvisceral engagement for the audience. Director Wu was also correct that Brucewas not a classically trained Cantonese Opera graduate. Bruce knew way more thanthree kicks, but he had not spent his youth, unlike the stuntmen and otheraction stars of his era, drilling dozens and dozens of traditional kung fu formsfrom dawn to dusk.Chow had a tough decision to make. The movie needed a director, but he hadalready invested $7,500 in Bruce Lee. Before deciding whom to fire, Chow watchedthe daily rushes. He saw in Bruce’s moves the expertise that Director Wu hadmissed. “Actually, his three legs were astonishing, very good,” Chow says. Hewas so impressed he decided to turn the insult into a compliment. Golden Harvestmarketing material for The Big Boss hyped the “Amazing Three Leg Lee.” (WhenBruce later acquired a reputation as a ladies’ man, the tabloid press had afield day with this nickname.)Raymond called the on-set producer, Liu Liang Hwa (Gladys)—the same woman whohad recruited Bruce in L.A. and was the wife of director Lo Wei—to ask heradvice. Gladys told Raymond that Director Wu was an ill-tempered man who hadalienated most of the crew. She had a self-interested suggestion for how tosolve the crisis. Her husband had recently finished filming a movie for GoldenHarvest in Taiwan. Why not bring Lo Wei to Thailand to replace Director Wu? Chowagreed. Bruce was relieved to no longer have to deal with Director Wu, but thefifty-two-year-old Lo Wei would prove an even more difficult challenge.Image [../images/sec.jpg]When he was a younger man, Lo Wei was a matinee idol in Shanghai. After theCommunist takeover in 1949, he fled with the rest of the Shanghai moviecommunity to Hong Kong where he remade himself into a director and waseventually hired by Shaw Bros. While he may have lacked the visual genius ofHong Kong’s best director, King Hu, he was still a highly valued craftsman, whocranked out seventeen profitable movies for Shaw in less than six years. It wasa coup for Raymond Chow to poach him from Shaw Bros. If there was anyone whocould rescue a troubled movie shoot it was Lo Wei.As a director, Lo Wei retained the arrogance and narcissism of a former screenstar. His nickname around the studio was “Orson Welles” for his booming baritonevoice, his weight, his ego, his temper, and his tendency to cast himself in hisown movies. (He gave himself the role of Chief Inspector in Bruce’s next movie,Fist of Fury.) Having spent his life on movie sets, Bruce picked up on thisright away, writing to his wife, “Another director (a fame lover) just arrivedsupposedly to take over the present director’s job. It really doesn’t matter, aslong as he is capable as well as cooperative.”Lo Wei didn’t believe in cooperating with his actors. He demanded deference andobedience. He also must have expected a bit of gratitude from Bruce. After all,it was his son who had noticed Bruce on TV, it was Lo Wei who told Raymond Chowto hire Bruce, and it was his wife who had gone to L.A. to recruit him.Kowtowing to authority figures was not Bruce’s forte. Just as he had with RubyChow, Bruce refused to use Lo Wei’s title when addressing him, a shocking breachof etiquette on a Hong Kong movie set. Instead he just called him “Lo Wei.” This failure to give him face irritated Lo Wei immensely. Lo Wei’s wife,Gladys, tried to intercede. “Our conflicts began with little things,” Lo Weirecalled in a 1988 interview. “He liked to call me by my full name when we wereon set. He’d shout ‘Lo Wei! Lo Wei!’ So my wife said to him, ‘How can you callhim by his full name? He is much older than you. If you want to sound moreintimate or familiar then call him “Uncle Lo.” If you want to sound more politethen simply call him “Director Lo.” ’ ”Lo Wei was even more taken aback when Bruce tried to get involved with thedirection and production sides. Bruce felt, rightly, that Hong Kong movies werefar behind those made in Japan and America and wanted to improve them. Lo Weipreferred to do things as they had always been done. By most accounts, Lo Weiwas a hands-off director, not overly invested in the details of his movies.While the actors were filming scenes, he often turned up his radio to listen tohorse and dog races. If someone disturbed him during a race or his horse lost,he would bellow in rage. For a perfectionist like Bruce, this negligent approachto directing was offensive. In a letter to his wife, Bruce wrote, “The film I’mdoing is quite amateur-like. A new director has replaced the uncertain old one;this new director is another so-so one with an almost unbearable air ofsuperiority.”Bruce “Three Leg” Lee also clashed with the veteran stunt director on set, HanYing-Chieh, who was also playing the role of the villainous Big Boss in themovie. As Bruce and Han Ying-Chieh were fighting each other in front of thecameras, they were also battling behind the scenes for control over the style ofthe fight choreography. Han Ying-Chieh wanted the theatrical, mimetic CantoneseOpera movements; Bruce insisted it be as realistic as possible, even going sofar as to actually hit his costars. Han remembers being kicked by the LittleDragon: “His grasp of timing and space was excellent, but he threw his punchesand kicks too hard. The time my face got grazed by a kick of his, though it waspainful, I still consider myself lucky.”The final result was a series of compromises between the two men’s styles. Brucewas able to introduce certain elements that would become part of his iconicimage—spinning high kicks, quick knockouts, and even tasting his own blood. (Oneof his students, Larry Hartsell, had told Bruce about a bar brawl where he hadtasted his own blood and terrified his opponents. Bruce loved the story andadopted it into his repertoire.) Han Ying-Chieh included certain stereotypicalfeatures from Hong Kong action movies, like trampoline jumps and a handful ofextended classical kung fu back-and-forth sequences.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Faced with a defiant actor, director Lo Wei wasn’t sure what to do. He couldn’tfire him. His only recourse was to leverage the competition between Bruce andJames Tien over who would end up the star of the movie. When Bruce had insistedon being part of a movie that already had a lead, Raymond Chow realized he had abackup plan if Bruce lacked the charisma to carry the movie. “This was thesubtlety of it,” says Andre Morgan. “If you look at the movie carefully, youwill see the movie starts out with two stars, because they wanted to screen-testBruce, see if he was real or not. Then halfway through, they made a decision.‘Who to kill, and who to keep alive?’ ”Before the decision was made, Lo Wei was able to play them off each other. Earlyon Lo Wei fought with Bruce over the exaggerated Cantonese Opera pantomimetechniques that Bruce loathed. “Lee would fight for three or four scenes. I toldhim to do this and that. Told him how he needed to fight. He wasn’t willing tofight anymore,” Lo Wei recalls. “The next day we really needed to film himfighting. Lee’s few moves weren’t going to cut it! But then I had an idea. WhenI arrived on set in the morning, I told Lee to take a seat next to me, and rest.Then, I called James Tien in. I decided to film him fighting instead of Lee. Ihad Tien jumping on the trampoline, doing falls, and doing flips for the camera.Lee sat next to me all morning. He thought it wasn’t right. Tien was fightingtoo much. Lee probably thought that Tien would replace him as the star of thefilm. So after that day, Lee was a bit more cooperative, a bit more willing tofight for the camera.”Around this time, Bruce seems to have gained a slightly greater appreciation forLo Wei. In a letter to his wife, he grudgingly wrote, “The shooting is pickingup steam and moving along much better than it was. The new director is no RomanPolanski but as a whole he is a better choice than our ex-director.” And Lo Weimust have come to appreciate Bruce Lee’s star potential, because he decided tokill off James Tien at the end of Act I, and give the rest of the movie toBruce.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Lo Wei claims that when he arrived in Thailand the screenplay for The Big Bosswas only three sheets of paper, likely an exaggeration but not by much. HongKong movies were often started with just a basic idea of the plot—the directorand producers improvised the rest during filming. With details seemingly pulledfrom his own biography, Bruce plays Cheng Chao-an, a reformed troublemaker whohas been sent away to a foreign country (Thailand) to work in an ice factory.His promise to his mother not to fight again is embodied by a jade pendant hewears around his neck. He is greeted by James Tien’s character, the leader ofthe workers, who immediately beats up some bullies while Bruce watches and pullson his pendant in frustration. The ice factory is actually a front for a drugsmuggling operation. When two workers discover some heroin packed in blocks ofice, they are secretly executed and their bodies hidden in the ice. James Tienconfronts the Big Boss about his missing workers and threatens to go to thepolice. The Big Boss’s minions kill him in a gruesome battle.From this point on, Bruce shifts from sidekick to hero of the movie. Unlike inreal life, his character is a country bumpkin, easily fooled. The boss makes himthe foreman and at a banquet plies him with alcohol and Thai prostitutes,leading to Bruce’s first ever sex scene on film. Upon entering the bedroom, herather innocently passes out while the Thai prostitute undresses and snugglesnext to his sleeping body. It is only after he discovers the body parts of theworkers frozen in blocks of ice that he realizes he’s been duped. Bruce latertold reporters, “The character I played was a very simple, straightforward guy.Like, if you told this guy something, he’d believe you. Then, when he finallyfigures out he’s been had, he goes animal.”Making the decision to confront the Big Boss and his almost certain death,Bruce’s character, Cheng Chao-an, throws all his worldly goods into the river.In the original, director’s cut version of the movie, Cheng Chao-an then headsback to the brothel for one last bit of fun. He picks out a prostitute, pushesher onto the bed, and strips naked (the headboard of the bed conceals hisprivate parts). It was the only nude sex scene of Bruce’s film career. After theprostitute falls asleep, Cheng Chao-an steals a package of rice crackers fromher bed stand and heads off to the Big Boss’s estate.This scene, along with about five minutes of other X-rated material, was cutfrom the Cantonese-language and international versions released in Hong Kong andthe West primarily to appease the censors. But it also made commercial sense:test audiences were upset that the hero of the film postponed his revenge forsex and crackers. In the edited version, Bruce’s character suddenly appears infront of the Big Boss’s estate inexplicably eating rice crackers.The final climactic battle was filmed during the crew’s last three days in PakChong. It proved difficult for Bruce. First, he had to face down the Big Boss’sGerman shepherd. Bruce loved dogs but had a phobia about attack dogs. Lo Weiseemed to enjoy his star’s discomfort. “We borrowed the dog from a militarybarracks. Everyone was afraid of it. He was a mean dog,” Lo Wei remembers. “Leetried to fight, but he wasn’t doing well. He refused to be filmed. ‘I’m notkidding! You can’t film me!’ In the end there was nothing we could do. The dogwas staring him down. Lee had a frightened look on his face. We all laughed athim. He’s such a great hero. How can he be afraid of one dog? So we brought in asecond dog, which we put under anesthesia while we were filming. It was prettycruel of us. The dog would pass out, and we’d need seven or eight people tothrow him around in front of the camera.”Bruce had suffered some minor wounds throughout the shoot—a cut finger on acheap piece of glass—but the most time-consuming injury turned out to be asprained ankle. He wrote to Linda, “I’ve gone through two days of hell. Isprained my ankle rather badly from a high jump—which required a drive of twohours to Bangkok to see a doctor—consequently I caught the flu (Bangkok is hotand stuffy and the traffic is a 24 hr. jam). Anyways, with fever, cold, achesand pain, we used close-ups while I dragged my leg to finish the last fight.”For the film, they added a moment where the Big Boss, played by the fightdirector Han Ying-Chieh, cuts Bruce’s leg to explain his limp.Image [../images/sec.jpg]While Bruce was filming in the remote village of Pak Chong, Paramount TV sentrepeated telegrams to Golden Harvest’s Hong Kong offices trying to track himdown. Before he had left Los Angeles, four episodes of Longstreet had beenfilmed. The original plan was for Bruce’s episode, “The Way of the InterceptingFist,” to air third in the lineup. But Tom Tannenbaum, the head of Paramount TV,liked it so much he decided to make it the season opener during Fall PremiereWeek on September 16, 1971. This decision created a dilemma for Tannenbaum. WithBruce’s character Li Tsung playing such a prominent part in the pilot, viewerswould naturally expect him to be a recurring character in the series. But Brucehad not signed the multi-episode deal Tannenbaum had offered him prior to hisdeparture. Paramount was desperate to get him under contract and back to Americato film more episodes.After several failed attempts to speak by phone, Tannenbaum finally was able toreach Bruce in Bangkok. To entice him to return, he offered Bruce $1,000 perepisode for three more episodes of Longstreet and promised to develop a TV showspecifically for Bruce to star in called Tiger Force. “ ‘Longstreet’ is such asuccess that reaction is instantaneous whenever my character comes up,” Bruceexcitedly wrote to Linda. “So Paramount is asking me to reappear and stay as are-occurrence character. In the meantime Tannenbaum is working on ‘TigerForce.’ ”Bruce agreed to fly back to Hollywood after The Big Boss wrapped to film theadditional episodes of Longstreet, but he didn’t think $1,000 was enough. Hesent a telegram to Tannenbaum asking for $2,000 per episode. “Who knows what thefuture might hold?” Bruce explained in a letter to Linda. “There comes a timewhen you have to advance or retreat—this time I can always retreat to my HongKong deal.”As he waited several weeks for a reply, his letters to Linda grew increasinglyanxious. “Disregard the consequences, I am firm in my ground of ‘it’s about timeto raise my worth,’ ” Bruce wrote. “Tell Brandon when I go to Bangkok, I’ll pickhim up some toys and send them to him—unless the Paramount deal doesn’t comethrough. Who knows what will happen? At any rate, one way or other I don’t mindtoo much. The future looks extremely bright indeed. Like the song says, ‘We’veonly just begun.’ ”When he finally heard from Paramount, his relief was palpable. Tannenbaum agreedto $2,000 per episode for three episodes and Bruce would only be required on-setfor a maximum of nine days. Now Bruce could afford to buy presents for hischildren and his wife. “You will see my 7th anniversary gift—a his and herpresent,” he wrote to Linda. “Should have one and a half grand when I return—Ihope anyway.”  The his-and-her anniversary present was a pair of matching rings.“Bruce sometimes forgot my birthday,” Linda says, “though he was generally verygood about our wedding anniversary.”All of Paramount’s telegrams and transpacific telephone calls to the GoldenHarvest offices had a side benefit. They transformed Bruce in Raymond Chow’seyes into a hot Hollywood property. “It’s funny,” Bruce later told reporters,“but when Paramount sent telegrams and telephoned Hong Kong for me, boy, theproducers there thought I was an important star. My prestige must have increasedthreefold.”And it wasn’t just Hollywood increasing his stature. Spies on the set of The BigBoss were reporting back to Run Run Shaw that Bruce Lee was the real deal.Realizing he had made a mistake letting Bruce slip away, Run Run tried to stealhim from Raymond. “Golden Harvest is terribly shaken now for Shaw Brothers hasbeen calling me and writing for me to work with them instead,” Bruce wrote toLinda. “They are using all means to get me. One thing is for sure, I’m the superstar in H.K.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]In the last few days of filming in Pak Chong, Raymond Chow visited the set tomeet his “superstar” for the first time in person. He was eager to reaffirmtheir relationship. Bruce was his usual confident self, telling Raymond, “Youjust wait, I’m going to be the biggest Chinese star in the world.”Bruce’s confidence was infectious. Golden Harvest made The Big Boss the flagshipof its turnaround efforts. Raymond threw much of his remaining capital intomarketing the movie: buying extensive ads and throwing a lavish welcoming partyfor Bruce and the crew when they returned to Hong Kong’s Kai Tak Airport onSeptember 3, 1971. Reporters gathered to get a first look at Raymond Chow’s newtalent. Having spent years mastering how to charm Western reporters, Bruceeffortlessly won over the Hong Kong press. When they asked him how he wouldcompare himself to Hong Kong’s biggest action star, Jimmy Wang Yu, hoping tostir up a rivalry, he carefully ducked the question: “I know everyone has seenWang Yu’s performances in other films. The Big Boss will be in theaters soon, soI invite everyone to watch it and make their own comparisons—isn’t that betterthan for me to try to brag?”He then deftly gained their sympathy with an amusing story of the prejudice hefaced as a Chinese man in America: “One day, I was mowing my lawn when anAmerican walked by and asked me how much I charged for the service. I said tohim, ‘I am doing this for free, but when I’m done cutting the grass, I’m goingto sleep with the woman inside the house.’ ” And then he appealed to thereporter’s sense of Chinese patriotism: “In America, I am always playingsidekicks and villains, using Eastern martial arts as a kind of sideshow. Buthere in Hong Kong and Taiwan, I think our martial arts films have been tooheavily influenced by the Japanese, such that I feel suffocated. I want to showthem what we can do!”Even questions about his conflict with Lo Wei didn’t throw Bruce off his charmoffensive. “It’s true that Lo Wei and I often argued on the set, but it was allfor the purpose of making The Big Boss the best movie we could,” Bruce told thereporters. “Since we are both strong-willed, it was inevitable that there wouldbe some ‘butting of heads,’ but these were always about the work, and were notpersonal; I do not think it will be a problem for us to work together again inthe future.”Lo Wei was less diplomatic. He told the press that Bruce was spoiled andarrogant, saying he acted as if everyone were beneath him. And he beganwhispering in reporters’ ears that it was really he who had taught Three Leg Leehow to fight on film.Fortunately, Bruce didn’t read what Lo Wei said about him in the papers. WithParamount and Shaw Bros. vying for his services, he was focused on using thisleverage to his advantage. Bruce demanded that Raymond delay his next film so hecould return to Hollywood to film three episodes of Longstreet. Chow also agreedto fly Bruce’s family back to Hong Kong and set them up in an apartment with nostrings attached—originally Chow had insisted that Bruce perform in a short filmabout Jeet Kune Do in exchange for Linda’s airfare. For the rest of his career,Lee employed this simple strategy of playing his various suitors off each other:Chow versus Shaw and Hong Kong versus Hollywood. By the time he got on a planeto return to Los Angeles on September 6, 1971, Bruce had every reason to believehe had finally become the master of his destiny.Image [../images/sec.jpg]The day after his arrival in L.A., Bruce was back on set shooting his role inthree different Longstreet episodes: “Spell Legacy Like Death” (episode 6),“Wednesday’s Child” (episode 9), and “ ‘I See,’ Said the Blind Man” (episode10). They were not written by Silliphant, who was busy working on the screenplayfor The Poseidon Adventure (1972). Instead they had been assigned to otherless-talented writers and finished prior to Bruce’s return. The writers didlast-minute revisions to give Bruce the equivalent of a “walk through”part—sticking him in the background, tossing him a few trivial lines ofdialogue.The opening of the sixth episode, “Spell Legacy Like Death,” jumps right into atraining session between Bruce’s character, Li Tsung, and James Franciscus’sMike Longstreet without any reference to where Li Tsung has been for the lastfive shows. They are even wearing the same workout clothes from the pilot. Theinside joke for the writers was about whether Bruce was going to rejoin the caston a permanent basis. After Longstreet receives a blackmail call from a bomberthreatening to blow up a major bridge, Li Tsung offers to help. “You joining theteam, Li?” asks Longstreet. Li Tsung replies, “It is always more rewarding to bea participant instead of an observer.” When the bomber demands that Longstreetcome alone with the blackmail money, he leaves his kung fu master behind. As hedeparts, Longstreet repeats the inside joke: “You going to hang in here a while,Li?”His next Longstreet episode, “Wednesday’s Child,” is a flashback to The GreenHornet. Li Tsung becomes the blind detective’s chauffeur. At the end of theshow, Li Tsung blasts through the bad guys with a series of spinning and flyingkicks. Compared to four years prior, Bruce’s skills as a martial arts performerhave improved dramatically and his ability to clearly deliver English dialoguehas vastly improved. But he is still playing the manservant to a rich whitemaster.In “Spell Legacy Like Death,” Bruce has nineteen lines; in “Wednesday’s Child,”it’s twelve; by the third and final of his Longstreet episodes, “ ‘I See,’ Saidthe Blind Man,” he’s got five. He holds a punching bag while Longstreet lets offsome steam. He has no role at all in the plot. After such a promising start, LiTsung as a character has become a step back from Kato. He’s less important thanLongstreet’s guide dog. In the majority of scenes, Bruce is seen in reactionshots while the other characters are talking, and he is usually looking downwith his arms defensively crossed. Linda says that Bruce found his role in thesethree episodes to be “anticlimactic.” (He probably used a more colorfuladjective.)Bruce fought for every line of dialogue. As a practical joke, he would hidebehind the office door of Joel Rogosin, the head writer on the series. WhenRogosin walked in, Bruce would grab him from behind, wrap his arms around him,and say, “I need more lines in the script!” Rogosin remembers, “He was smallerthan I was but extremely strong. If he grabbed you, you stayed in his hold untilhe decided to let go. I would say, ‘Whatever you want.’ He was a delight.”Despite his disappointment in the number of lines he was given, Bruce remained alively and entertaining member of the cast, clowning around between takes. “Hewould take all the air out of his body and then he would begin to inflatehimself. He would begin to take in air; he would kind of balloon up,” saysMarlyn Mason, who played Nikki Bell. “And we had such fun watching him. We wouldsay, ‘Blow yourself up, blow yourself up.’ ”Image [../images/sec.jpg]The Longstreet pilot episode aired on September 16, 1971. The New York Timesdelivered its verdict three days later. It was mixed for the show itself but arave for Bruce’s performance.In the first episode, “The Way of the Intercepting Fist,” Longstreet wastes notime in getting mugged by some waterfront hijackers. He is rescued by a Chineseyouth, Li Tsung, who demolishes the thugs with a spectacular demonstration ofsomething resembling super-karate. It turns out to be an ancient Chinese art ofself-defense and, naturally, Longstreet wants to cram in a few lessons.Li, well played by Bruce Lee, turns out to be a sort of disciplined superboy,providing a Robin for Longstreet’s Batman and given to heavy salutations like“May it be well with you.” Inner peace is Li’s secret weapon: “You’ve got aquarrelsome mind, Mr. Longstreet. Unless you learn how to calm it, you willnever hear the world outside.”There is, in other words, a little something for everybody. The blind heroelicits instant sympathy. . . . The Chinaman (who emerges impressively enough tojustify a series of his own) lends a deft touch of exotica with advice on how to“learn the art of dying.”Bruce was ecstatic. He told a friend, “Boy, am I glad it was so favorable.” Inan interview a year later, Bruce proudly repeated the quote, almostword-for-word, from memory, “The New York Times said, like, ‘The Chinamanincidentally came off quite convincingly enough to earn himself a televisionseries,’ and so on and so forth.”Audiences also loved Bruce’s performance. “We had more fan mail on that episodethan on any of the other shows we did in the series,” says Silliphant. “And thefan mail that came pouring in was all for Bruce.”After filming the three extra episodes of Longstreet, Bruce was done with theshow. It had served its purpose. The pilot had grabbed the attention of thepublic and earned him an endorsement from The New York Times for his own TVshow. And Bruce already had two solid TV prospects in development: Paramount’sTiger Force, and, much to the surprise of everyone including Bruce, Warner’sKung Fu.Image [../images/sec.jpg]While Bruce was in Thailand filming The Big Boss, Fred Weintraub had an idea forhow to revive Kung Fu—instead of a feature film, turn it into an ABC Movie ofthe Week. If Warner’s movie division couldn’t appreciate Kung Fu’s brilliance,he’d just give it away like secondhand clothes to its TV people. Weintraubmarched the Kung Fu screenplay over to Tom Kuhn, head of the Warner Bros. TVdivision.As Kuhn was sitting in his office, he heard his secretary saying to someone,“You can’t just walk in there.”As he looked up, he saw this huge guy walking toward his desk. “Who are you?”Kuhn asked.“I’m Fred Weintraub,” Weintraub said, as he plunked down the Kung Fu screenplayon his desk.Reading the title, Kuhn joked, “I’ve never heard of ‘kung fu,’ but it soundslike something I had for lunch. I think I got some on my tie.”“Just read it,” Weintraub replied. “You’ll like it.”Tom Kuhn loved it, but it was a movie script—too long and expensive to producefor television. Kuhn called Weintraub. “Fred, this is fabulous,” Kuhn said. “I’dlove to do it, but I can’t afford it for television.”“Tear out every other page,” Fred suggested.Kuhn started laughing. “Fred, we’re going to be friends for life.”ABC loved the script too. Warner Bros. and ABC announced their TV deal for KungFu on July 22, 1971.Back in New York City, Howard Friedlander, who had written the original moviescreenplay with Ed Spielman, heard about the TV deal after running into a friendon the street. “I remember this very clearly like it happened ten minutes ago. Iwas walking east on 54th Street in Manhattan. I had about two dollars in mypocket. I was broke, and I was alone. I bumped into a friend, and he says, ‘Hey,I see they’re making your movie.’ I looked at him like he was nuts. I said,‘What movie?’ He says, ‘Oh, that Kung Fu thing, it’s in the trades.’ Well, Icouldn’t get to a newsstand fast enough, and I sprang for a copy of Variety. Istarted flipping through it until I found that Warner Bros. was making Kung Fu.And I got to a phone—a pay phone, there were no cells in those days. And Icalled Ed and I called [our agent Peter] Lampack, and we had a meeting, andLampack called the West Coast and found out they were making this, as a TVmovie.”Bruce heard about the TV deal for Kung Fu after he returned to America inSeptember. ABC had scheduled the air date for February 22, 1972. Kuhn planned tostart production on December 15, 1971. The casting process was already underway, but they had yet to find the right actor to play Kwai Chang Caine, theEurasian kung fu master.The buzz about Bruce’s performance in Longstreet had already reached the ears ofTed Ashley, the president of Warner Bros. Once he learned that Tom Tannenbaum atParamount was developing a TV series specifically for Bruce, Ashley decided tosteal Bruce away. “It was because of Longstreet that Ted Ashley and Warner Bros.became interested in him,” says Silliphant.Two days after the New York Times review of Longstreet hit the newsstands, Brucewas called in for a meeting with one of Ashley’s underlings, Jerry Leider. Afterthe meeting, Ashley phoned Kuhn personally to lobby for Bruce. “Ashley called meand congratulated me on the sale of Kung Fu and asked me to see Bruce as apossible lead,” Kuhn recalls. “Ted was looking to further Bruce’s career.”Kuhn’s office scheduled an appointment with Bruce for 3:30 p.m. on September 24,1971. It wasn’t a formal audition but a casual meet-and-greet. For all intentsand purposes, the part was Bruce’s to lose. All he had to do was convince Kuhn.Image [../images/sec.jpg]A more cautious soul might have opted for a low-key approach, but the fieryBruce made a bold choice for his entrance. He walked into Kuhn’s office, kickedthe door shut with his foot, dropped his gym bag on the floor, pulled out anunchaku, and started swinging it at Kuhn.“What are you doing?” Kuhn asked in terror as the sticks whipped around hisface.“Don’t move,” Bruce said.“Don’t worry, I’m not going anywhere,” Kuhn said. “Put that goddamn thing down.”Bruce stopped whirling the nunchaku and stuck out his forearm. “Feel my arm,” hedemanded.Tom did. It was like a rock. “Okay, please sit down,” Kuhn said. “Take it easy.”Once Kuhn got Bruce to put the nunchacku away, they had a thirty-minute meetingthat was half business, half personal. Despite the frightening introduction,Kuhn found himself won over by Bruce’s charm, charisma, and wit. “I just wantedto get a feel for the guy and a sense of how he came across. We talked about hisHong Kong movie, The Big Boss,” Kuhn remembers. “His presence was justmesmerizing. I really enjoyed my time with him. His energy was just fantastic.He was entertaining and he was a character.”On first blush, Bruce seemed perfect for the part. After all, he was the onlyactor in Hollywood who was also a Eurasian kung fu master. But the role of KwaiChang Caine, the half-American, half-Chinese Buddhist monk, as written had avery different flavor from Bruce’s personality. “The concept of the series was aman who was not involved, a man who avoided action at almost any cost, a veryquiet, seemingly passive man,” says John Furia, a producer on the show. Cainewas not the type of man who would, for example, burst into an audition and startswinging a nunchaku. “It did occur to me that this part was rather cerebral,”says Kuhn, “a guy who only fights when he’s absolutely cornered.” Even FredWeintraub, who lobbied for Bruce to get the job, noted that Warners needed anactor “to portray the sense of quiet serenity that Caine possessed, a qualitythat driven and intense Bruce was not known for.”But for Kuhn, the biggest problem with Bruce as Kwai Chang Caine boiled down toone thing—his accent. “By the end of the half hour I really liked the guy, butfrankly I had trouble understanding him,” Kuhn says. “It was fun, but myconclusion was that we’d have to loop the hell out of this guy for an Americantelevision audience to understand him. And you can do that with a movie, but youcan’t do it on an every-week basis with a television show. You have to takeyourself back to 1971. Television was pretty primitive back then. You only hadthe three networks. Things that weren’t easy for that mass audience to absorb,either audio-wise or visually, their tendency was just to change the channel.”After the meeting, Kuhn called Fred Weintraub. “What the fuck was that?” Kuhnlaughed. “He nearly caved my skull in with a pair of clubs.”“That was Bruce Lee,” Weintraub replied. “What do you think about him for KungFu?”“He’s amazing,”  Tom gushed. “I’ve never seen anything like that. But gettinghim the lead is still going to be a long shot. He might be too authentic.”After considering it some more, Kuhn decided Bruce wasn’t right for the role. Hecalled up Ted Ashley to inform him.“I understand,” Ashley said. “It’s your gig, your choice.”With Bruce scratched off the top of the list and no other viable Eurasian actorsin Hollywood in 1971, the producers had to decide between powdering an Asianactor’s face or applying eye makeup to a white actor—as Hollywood had done somany times in its yellow-face tradition. But in that increasingly raciallycharged era, the white producers and executives knew that would be problematic.Kuhn says, “We sought out every Asian in Hollywood, because you didn’t have tobe super bright to know what was coming.” Among the Asian actors considered wereMako, who guest-starred on The Green Hornet with Bruce, and George Takei, whoplayed Sulu on Star Trek. “We read everyone, but none of them really measuredup. There wasn’t one guy who showed up who we thought, ‘This guy can carry aseries,’ ” Kuhn says. “Mako had a thick accent, and Takei was not the physicaltype.”Having discarded the Asian half of Caine’s ancestry, they turned to the Americanside and began auditioning white actors. “David Carradine came in to read and hewas just bouncing off the wall. I don’t know what he was on that day, but he wason lots. I called his manager afterwards and said, ‘You know, even if he werefabulous’—and he did actually give a pretty good reading—‘you can’t do atelevision series with a guy who’s stoned all the time,’ ” Kuhn remembers. “Butwe still couldn’t find anybody, and we were maybe two weeks away fromproduction, and I didn’t have a lead. All the other parts were cast, and thenext time his manager called I said, ‘You know what, send him in. What have wegot to lose?’ So David came in, completely straight, gave an incredible reading,and bottom line, we finally hired him. And that was the last time I ever sawDavid Carradine straight.”Carradine signed for the role sometime in late November 1971. When word got out,George Takei and the Association of Asian Pacific American Artists (AAPAA) fileda formal complaint for unfair hiring practices. Kuhn says, “He kind of tried toorganize the Asian actors against what was going on with Kung Fu.”  They wantedDavid Carradine replaced with an Asian actor and a Chinese historical advisorhired. Kuhn agreed to their second demand but not the first. “We had an Asianadvisor, kung-fu guy on the show, David Chow, and as much Asian involvement aswe could get, but David Carradine was to be the star of the show.”  The Asianacting community was not pleased with the compromise, but pragmatism outbidideology. There were so few opportunities for Asian actors in Hollywood theydecided it was better to have a show on the air with lots of secondary roles forAsian actors, but a white lead, than no show at all. James Hong, who was thepresident of the AAPAA, says, “As the show went on, we realized it was a greatsource of employment for the Asian acting community.”Kuhn turned out to be correct in his assessment of Carradine: he was perfect forthe part and a huge risk. With its countercultural story line of pacifistOrientals threatened by aggressive Caucasians, Kung Fu was a surprise culturalhit, especially among college kids protesting the Vietnam War. Carradine wasnominated for a Best Actor Emmy in 1973 and a Golden Globe in 1974. But despiteits critical and popular success, the show was canceled soon after Carradine wasarrested for attempted burglary and malicious mischief in 1974. While high onpeyote and completely naked, Carradine broke into a neighbor’s home and accostedtwo young women—allegedly assaulting one while asking if she was a witch. Theyoung woman sued him for $1.1 million and was awarded $20,000. It was not thekind of press a network wants for an actor playing a wise, gentle Buddhist monk.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Despite Tom Kuhn’s concern about Bruce’s accent, Ted Ashley saw star potentialin him and, perhaps more important, didn’t want to lose him to Paramount. He wasworried Bruce would make Tiger Force once he discovered he wasn’t getting thepart of Kwai Chang Caine. In early October 1971, a month before David Carradinewas officially cast in Kung Fu, Ashley offered Bruce an exclusive developmentdeal to create his own TV show. The advance was an eye-popping $25,000 (or$152,000 in 2017 dollars)—enough money to pay off most of his mortgage.Bruce had a pitch ready. Since The Green Hornet, he had been writing movie andTV ideas in his notebooks. On one page he brainstormed a Chinese hero by timeperiod and type of job: “Western: (1) San Francisco sheriff (partner of a blindman?). Modern: (1) bounty hunter, (2) agent, (3) detective, (4) embassyintrigue?” On the next page, he expanded a little on the Western idea: “SanFrancisco: (1) Sheriff X, presiding, (2) Ah Sahm, a ronin (unofficial deputy ofSheriff X—take care of office for room and board).”He later developed this into a seven-page, typed TV proposal. The title of theshow was Ah Sahm, which was also the name of the lead character. The story wasset in the Old American West. Ah Sahm was a Chinese kung fu master who traveledto America to liberate Chinese workers being exploited by the tongs. In eachepisode Ah Sahm helped the weak and oppressed as he journeyed across the OldWest.The striking similarities between Ah Sahm and Kung Fu (both are EasternWesterns) has led some Bruce Lee biographers to mistakenly assume they were thesame project or that Bruce was the author of Kung Fu. In fact, they aredistinct. Ah Sahm is full Chinese, not half-American, half-Chinese, like KwaiChang Caine, and Ah Sahm is not a Shaolin monk—he is a warrior. Unfortunately,the proposal for Ah Sahm does not have a date, so it is unknown if Bruce typedit before or after he read the Kung Fu screenplay written by Ed Spielman andHoward Friedlander.Once Ashley offered Bruce the development deal, Bruce submitted his proposal toWarner Bros. with one alteration. He changed the title from Ah Sahm to TheWarrior. According to Linda, Bruce did not sign the contract for Warner’sdevelopment deal before he returned to Hong Kong. He wanted to wait and see howThe Big Boss did at the box office. If it did well, it would strengthen hisnegotiating position. As it turned out, The Big Boss succeeded beyond hiswildest expectations."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f0328-01.jpg]Smashing Japanese bad guys in Fist of Fury, March 1972.

They changed their clothes before they landed, becauseBruce expected a handful of reporters would greet them. They didn’t imagine thatRaymond Chow would arrange for the actors of The Big Boss to create acelebratory cavalcade of lanterns for them as soon as they stepped off theplane. This hero’s welcome gave Bruce the sense of a triumphant return.Even more than Bruce, Raymond Chow needed a hit. His first five films had donepoorly at the box office. With his studio under immense pressure from ShawBros., Chow’s future largely depended on the success of The Big Boss. Fromstaged events to advertising to media exposure, Chow pulled out every stop topublicize the movie. Leading up to the October 29 premiere, Bruce’s life was awhirlwind of print, radio, and TV interviews. Chow wanted to reintroduce theLittle Dragon to an older audience who might remember him as the spunky childactor from 1950s black-and-white weepies. Having done everything they could topromote the movie, both Raymond’s and Bruce’s fates rested on the outcome of itsopening night.Raymond, Bruce, and Linda entered the theater with some trepidation. Hong Kongaudiences were a notoriously tough crowd to please. They would very vocallycurse a bad movie. Some would even bring knives to the theaters and, if theywere disappointed, express it by slicing up their seats. “As the movieprogressed we kept looking at the reaction of the fans,” Bruce recalled. “Theyhardly made any noise at the beginning, but at the end they were in a frenzy andbegan clapping and clamoring. Those fans are emotional: if they don’t like amovie they’ll cuss and walk out.” As Bruce heard the audience cheering hischaracter throughout the movie, he grew increasingly relaxed and confident. Bythe time his first ever sex scene arrived, he leaned over to Linda and joked,“Part of the fringe benefits.”In the audience for the premiere was the famous Hong Kong movie critic and filmhistorian Mel Tobias. “I didn’t know who Bruce Lee was. It was just by accidentthat I saw the first show. I had a guest from Manila and he wanted to see amidnight show, and the midnight show was The Big Boss,”  Tobias recalls. “Whenthe film ended there was about ten seconds of silence. They didn’t know what hitthem, and then they started roaring. When they saw Bruce Lee, they were justcompletely stunned. And then the applause afterwards, which was thunderous. Andthe feeling I had: This guy is going to be IT. The way he projected the Orientaland the Asians gave us a sense of identity.”Bruce began the evening with modest hopes. “I didn’t expect The Big Boss tobreak any kind of record,” he confessed. “But I did expect it to be a moneymaker.”  The crowd’s reaction overwhelmed him. “That night every dream thatBruce had ever had came true as the audience rose to its feet with thunderous,cheering applause,” Linda says. “In less than two hours of action on the screen,Bruce became a glittering star, and as we left the theater we were absolutelymobbed.”The box office numbers were stunning and completely turned around GoldenHarvest’s fortunes. Shown in only sixteen Hong Kong theaters, The Big Boss tookin $372,000 Hong Kong dollars in its first day and passed the magical HK$1million mark in just three days. Over its three-week run in local theaters, TheBig Boss grossed HK$3.2 million. The China Mail estimated that 1.2 million HongKongers out of a population of four million paid to see the movie. To add apatriotic, hometown flair to the success, The Big Boss also smashed the previousbox office record held by The Sound of Music. A local Chinese newspaper crowed:“The Julie Andrews film had been local film distributors’ wildest dream at thebox office since it hit the screen in 1966.” Julie Andrews’s husband, BlakeEdwards, was one of Bruce’s celebrity students. Bruce had gone from teachingstars to being one.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Since he was three months old, Bruce had acted in twenty-three movies. None ofthem enjoyed anything like the fantastic success of The Big Boss. Most had beenfailures. What made this movie different? Certainly it wasn’t the quality of theproduction. In a 1988 interview, director Lo Wei reflected, “Now that I thinkabout it, The Big Boss really was a crappy film. I didn’t have much time. I justwanted to get it done, no matter how sloppily or whatever.”One key to its popularity was Bruce’s fight sequences. Unlike most action starswho train for a few months for a movie, Bruce was an expert martial artist—amaster of the art. Everyone else in The Big Boss looks like they are playingpatty-cake, while Bruce is a demonic whirlwind. Hong Kong audiences, who hadbeen raised on kung fu fare, knew the real deal when they saw it. To prove thathis fights were not bolstered by trick photography, Lee and Lo Wei usedextra-long takes—some lasting for twenty seconds and more. “What Lee would dowas choreograph a fight and let the camera run so you knew it wasn’t phony,”says Michael Kaye, another Golden Harvest director. “Remember, Lee was dealingwith a local audience who knew kung fu and they would have been able to tell ifit was phony.”But being the real deal is not enough. Plenty of great martial artists havebombed on-screen. What is effective in the ring is rarely exciting on film.Bruce made his bones in Hollywood as a fight choreographer and he knew how tomake his particular skill set look spectacular on celluloid. Call it enhancedrealism. On film, he knocks out three baddies with three spinning headkicks—something not even Bruce Lee could do in real life, but on film audiencesbelieved he could. As a critic for The Washington Post put it, “Bruce Lee inmotion is an exhilarating sight to behold—explosive, graceful and amusing. Leegets an audience response I haven’t heard since Steve McQueen’s motorcycle ridein The Great Escape. His performance [has] Cagney-esque cockiness and earlySteve McQueen nonchalance.”After twenty-five years as a working actor, Bruce had finally learned how toinvest actions with emotions. The transformation from the pleasant manservantKato in The Green Hornet to a berserker in The Big Boss was dramatic. For thefirst time since he was eighteen years old in The Orphan, Bruce had been giventhe starring role. Over this period of struggle and rejection and hard work, hehad managed to acquire the X-factor, the indefinable quality that sets MarilynMonroe—a “star”—above Sir Laurence Olivier—merely a “great actor.” Paul Heller,co-producer of Enter the Dragon, says, “Bruce had an intensity which the cameracaught. Some actors can be brilliant actors but the camera doesn’t love them—thecamera loved Bruce. Bruce’s energy, his raw talent and his excitement all camethrough the camera and onto the screen.” Bruce found a way to access thetremendous life force he possessed—“I can feel it sort of bubbling and roaringup inside of me,” he told friends—and translate it onto the screen. “I had moreconfidence as I had just done Longstreet,” he explained.Bruce’s electrifying performance tapped into the unconscious yearnings of thepublic. Hong Kong’s population in 1842 was seven thousand. In 1971 it was fourmillion. The vast majority were mainland Chinese who had fled successive wavesof disasters. Hong Kong was essentially a high-functioning refugee camp run byBritish businessmen. If anyone needed a shot of ethnic boosting it was the HongKong Chinese, who suffered from not only an inferiority complex but also anidentity crisis: Were they Chinese migrants or British colonial subjects or bothor what? Robert Clouse, who directed Enter the Dragon, argues, “Bruce did morefor the Chinese psyche than any dozen politicians and martyrs. This acted asgut-level therapy for millions of overworked and underprivileged people. Brucerekindled a feeling of pride and literally brought his countrymen to their feetscreaming and cheering in hundreds of theaters. They suddenly felt better aboutthemselves and could take another day with a little less pain and prejudice.”The phenomenal success of The Big Boss was also due to a shocking external eventthat set off a firestorm of Chinese nationalism right before its premiere. Itinvolved, of all things, a territorial dispute over some tiny abandoned islandsin the South China Sea. The Diaoyu Islands were seized along with Taiwan by theJapanese during the First Sino-Japanese War (1895) and renamed the SenkakuIslands. After World War II, these empty islands were placed under theadministrative control of the United States. A 1969 United Nations surveyidentified possible oil reserves in the area. China, Taiwan, and Japanimmediately claimed the forgotten islands, stirring up bitter memories. On June7, 1971, Richard Nixon announced his decision to give the islands to Japan. TheBig Boss was released on October 30. On November 29, the U.S. Senate approved anamendment stating that America would defend Japan in the case of an attack onthe Senkaku Islands.The Chinese felt deeply betrayed. There were protests and outraged editorials.“I remember it as if it was yesterday,” says Marciano Baptista, a Eurasianclassmate of Bruce’s brother Peter at La Salle. “The Americans did a very stupidthing giving the Senkaku Islands to Japan. You could’ve been Chinese fromanywhere, any denomination, any persuasion, any political background—they allsupported China on the Senkaku. One of the problems with Hong Kong is we neverhad an identity until after 1971 when we were forced to choose. We began to havea Chinese identity because they gave the islands to somebody else.”In an environment of rising ethnic nationalism, Bruce had heroically defendedhis fellow Chinese workers in The Big Boss and Chinese audiences loved him forit. In his next movie, Fist of Fury, he would make this nationalism explicit andthe public would love him even more. But first, he would have to endure his ownvery personal and very public humiliation at the hands of the Americans.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Bruce wasted no time in leveraging the success of The Big Boss to pivot back toHollywood. The day after the premiere, he wrote a letter to Ted Ashley,increasing his demands for the Warrior development deal. “In addition to our[previous] agreement, I should have a minimum of 4 months off a year to makefeatures in Hong Kong,” he wrote, “and I should have participation in the TVseries itself and merchandising.”For an interview with the English-language Sunday Post-Herald, dated November21, 1971, Bruce discussed the Warrior project. “I should find out within a weekwhether this thing is on. If so, I will hustle back to Hollywood,” Bruce said.“It’s a really freaky adventure series about a Chinese guy who winds up in theAmerican West in 1860. Can you dig that? All these cowboys on horses with gunsand me with a long, green hunk of bamboo, right? Far out. What’s holding thingsup now is that a lot of people are sitting around in Hollywood trying to decideif the American television audience is ready for an Oriental hero. We could getsome really peculiar reactions from places like the Deep South.”Bruce received an international call from Warner Bros. on November 25, 1971. Itwas a double body blow of bad news. Since Warners could only justify producingone Eastern Western, they had decided to make Kung Fu and reject The Warrior,and they were going to cast David Carradine as the lead, not Bruce Lee. The lossof a starring role and his development deal in one call was a bitter pill toswallow. “He was supremely disappointed,” Linda says. “We were not in very goodfinancial shape at that time. So this would have been a major breakthrough.”The Hong Kong press was calling Bruce “the ultimate Mid-Pacific Man”—a term atthat time for a Westernized Chinese. It was an apt phrase. Bruce wanted tostraddle the globe—to bring Western professionalism to Hong Kong movies andChinese culture to American TV. The danger for him was being caught in themiddle of the ocean with nowhere to call home. He was rejected for Kung Fubecause of his thick Chinese accent. He worried about being too Western for HongKong audiences. “There were some scenes in The Big Boss where I really didn’tthink I was Chinese enough,” Bruce said. “You really had to do a lot ofadjusting.”Being caught between two cultures was the theme that attracted Canadian TV’smost popular journalist, Pierre Berton, when he came to Hong Kong looking forthe appropriate subject to interview on December 9, 1971. Berton discovered thateveryone was talking about this previously unknown actor who had just brokenHong Kong’s box office record and was bragging that he was about to become thefirst Oriental to ever star in an American TV series.For his introduction, Berton framed Bruce as a man torn between East and West:“Bruce Lee faces a real dilemma. He’s on the verge of stardom in the UnitedStates with a projected TV series on the horizon, but he’s just achievedsuperstardom as a film actor here in Hong Kong. So how does he choose, the Eastor the West—the kind of problem that most budding movie actors would welcome.”At this moment, Bruce must have realized he faced another dilemma. Unaware thatThe Warrior had already been rejected, Berton intended to make it central to thetwenty-five-minute-long interview. Bruce had to decide if he was going to admithe didn’t have an American TV series on the horizon or try to dodge the subject.For the first half of the interview, Berton delved into other topics beforereturning to his central framing device: “There’s a pretty good chance thatyou’ll get a TV series in the States called The Warrior. Isn’t that where youuse the martial arts in a Western setting?”Bruce initially tried to avoid this question by bringing up a different TVproject: “Well, that was the original idea. Paramount—you know, I did Longstreetfor Paramount, and Paramount wants me to do a television series. On the otherhand, Warner Brothers wants me to be in another one. But both of them, I think,they want me to be a modernized type of a thing, and they think that the Westernidea is out. But I want—”“You wanted the Western,” Berton interjected, before pressing again. “Are yougoing to stay in Hong Kong and be famous, or are you going to go to the UnitedStates to be famous, or are you going to try to eat your cake and have it too?”“I am going to try to do both, because, you see, I have already made up my mindthat in the United States I think something about the Orientals, I mean, thetrue Orientals should be shown.”“Hollywood sure as heck hasn’t,” Berton agreed. “Let me ask you, however, aboutthe problems that you face as a Chinese hero in an American series. Have peoplecome up in the industry and said, well, we know how the audience is going totake a non-American?”“Well, such questions have been raised. In fact, it is being discussed, and thatis why The Warrior is probably not going to be on, I think, becauseunfortunately, such things does exist in this world, you see?” Bruce said,finally admitting the truth. “They think that business-wise it’s a risk, and Idon’t blame them. I mean, in the same way, it’s like in Hong Kong, if aforeigner comes and becomes a star, if I were the man with the money, I probablywould have my own worry of whether or not the acceptance would be there.”For his final question, Berton asked Lee, “Do you still think of yourself asChinese, or do you ever think of yourself as North American?”“Do you know how I want to think of myself?” Bruce responded. “As a human being,because I mean, I don’t want to sound like, you know, as Confucius say, butunder the sky, under the heaven, man, there is but one family. It just sohappened, man, that people are different.”A week after the Berton interview Bruce penned a gracious concession letter toTed Ashley. “I am sorry to hear about the outcome of ‘The Warrior.’ Well, youcannot win them all, but damn it, I am going to win one of these days,” Brucewrote, before suggesting some ways the two men could still work together. “Ifeel Warner can definitely create a martial arts script, preferably for feature,tailored for me. And maybe Warner can help in releasing my [Hong Kong] movies inthe States. I am daily improving in my acting and as a human being, and mydedication will definitely lead me to my goal. Any fair and rightful assistancefrom you will be deeply appreciated.”Since Bruce had bragged so extensively about the Warrior deal with Warner Bros.to the Hong Kong media, he needed a face-saving way to avoid directly admittinghe had been rejected. In this endeavor he was greatly aided by theChinese-language press with whom he was still enjoying a honeymoon period. OnDecember 18, 1971, The Hong Kong Standard, which had been launched in 1949 “togive a Chinese voice to the world,” ran the headline: “Bruce Lee Can Stay On inHK.” Under a smiling photo of the actor ran this caption: “Bruce Lee . . . anOriental first.”  The article stated: “Bruce Lee has been given permission byWarner Brothers of America to remain in Hong Kong for another six months. WarnerBrothers are planning a new television series, The Warrior, with Bruce Leetaking the leading role—the first time an Oriental actor has been given such anhonor. It is understood that Warners have now decided to delay the start of TheWarrior.” Once the six-month “delay” came and went, the Hong Kong press neverbrought up the topic of The Warrior again.Prior to the premiere of The Big Boss, Bruce planned to make one more film withGolden Harvest and then return to America for good to star in The Warrior orKung Fu. “His contract with Raymond Chow called for a second film, Fist ofFury,” says Linda. “His intentions were, vaguely, to finish this film for Chow,then return to Hollywood and consider several of his television offers.” But therejection by Warner Bros. and the incredible success of The Big Boss had changedhis calculations. He decided to extend his stay in Hong Kong. In December 1971,Bruce sold his Bel Air home and his Porsche and relocated his family to theWaterloo Hill neighborhood in Kowloon.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Bruce’s next movie, Fist of Fury, nearly foundered over clashes with director LoWei. It began with the first draft of Lo Wei’s “script,” which the director hadscribbled in the typical slapdash fashion of Hong Kong cinema. Having spentmonths carefully crafting the screenplay for The Silent Flute with Coburn andSilliphant, Bruce was disgusted by what he considered a lack of professionalism.He refused to begin filming until a detailed screenplay was written, bringingproduction to a screeching halt. Bruce was still only a contract player, but hewas already acting like he was Steve McQueen. “Raymond spent the weekendrewriting the script,” Andre Morgan says. “When Bruce saw the new script and sawit was going to work and he was going to have more input on the fight scenes, heagreed to make the movie.”The story Raymond Chow, Lo Wei, and Bruce agreed upon was based on the life andlegend of Master Huo Yuanjia. He was the founder of the famed kung fu schoolJing Wu (“Excellence in Martial Arts”). Huo Yuanjia became a national hero in1902 when he challenged a Russian wrestler who had called China “The Sick Man ofAsia.”  The Russian immediately apologized for his remarks. In a countryravenous for heroes, Huo Yuanjia became an overnight legend. His life was firstfictionalized in the seminal novel Modern Chivalry Heroes, by the foundingfather of the martial arts genre, Ping Jiang. In the novel, Huo beats martialarts champions from Russia, Japan, and England—restoring pride to his people. Atthe end, he is killed by the trickery of the Japanese.Fist of Fury cleverly avoided retelling this tale—what the Chinese call “warmingover yesterday’s rice”—to focus on the fallout after his death. Instead ofplaying Huo Yuanjia, as one might expect, Bruce Lee was cast as his top student,Chen Zhen. Bruce explained to reporters, “That is more interesting because HuoYuanjia is sort of limited as a character for a film because you’ve got tofollow how his history goes.”In the movie, Bruce, as Chen Zhen, arrives late for his master’s funeral. Afterthe burial a delegation of Japanese judo students shows up with a mocking gift:a sign that reads “Sick Man of Asia.” Out of fear of the consequences (theschool is located in the Japanese-controlled concession of Shanghai), theChinese kung fu disciples restrain themselves. But Bruce, appropriately playingthe hothead of the bunch, goes alone to the Japanese school to return their giftwith an extra helping of his furious fists. After beating the stuffing out ofeveryone in the room, he rips the sign into pieces and says in the Chineseversion, “Now you listen to me, I’ll only say this once, the Chinese are not thesick men of Asia!”While a Hollywood movie would likely have ended on this triumphant moment,Chinese fatalism turns the flick into a cautionary tale about the cycle ofviolence. After Bruce humbles and humiliates the Japanese, they attack hisschool, severely injuring his friends. While Bruce is killing the Japanesesensei, who poisoned his master, the sensei’s students are slaughtering hisfriends. Upon returning to his school to discover the horror his righteousrevenge has wrought, Bruce is surrounded by police. Instead of running or beingtaken into custody, he charges the police with a flying kick. Guns fire. Theframe freezes. The End.Bruce was extremely proud of the final scene. “At the end I died under thegunfire,” he said. “But it’s a very worthwhile death. I walk out and I say‘Screw you, man! Here I come!’ Boom! And I leap out and leap up in the air, andthen they stop the frame and then ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bang!—like Butch Cassidy andthe Sundance Kid.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]Bruce may have refused to start filming until the screenplay was finished, buthe’d never been one to sit still. While the production was delayed, he boldlytook it upon himself to make a solo trip to Japan to entreat his matinee idol tojoin his movie. Arriving in the Roppongi district of Tokyo, the Little Dragonwent to the offices of Shintaro Katsu, the forty-year-old star of the Zatoichifilm series.“Mr. Katsu, I hold you in high esteem, cinematically and otherwise,” Bruceflattered. “I want to act with you, and I want to learn from you.” He proceededto pepper Katsu with dozens of questions about how he made his movies.Beyond the opportunity to be near his idol, Bruce wanted to work with Katsubecause he had starred with Jimmy Wang Yu in Zatoichi Meets the One-ArmedSwordsman. Bruce considered Jimmy an unworthy rival—an actor pretending to be atough guy, not a serious martial artist—and had developed a real contempt forhim. If Bruce could get Shintaro Katsu to appear in his movie and it did betterthan Jimmy Wang Yu’s, it would establish him as the bigger of the two men.This was particularly important because Fist of Fury’s themes were liftedwholesale from another Jimmy Wang Yu movie, The Chinese Boxer (1970), which hadbeen produced by Shaw Bros. In that film just as in Fist of Fury, noble Chinesekung fu students must defend themselves against dastardly Japanese karate andjudo masters. If Fist of Fury was a hit, Bruce could stick it to both Jimmy WangYu and Run Run Shaw with one punch.Unfortunately, Katsu refused. “I am so terribly sorry, but I cannot act withyou,” Shintaro Katsu told Bruce. “I am contractually bound.” As a consolation,Katsu offered Bruce two actors from his troupe: Riki Hashimoto, a formerprofessional baseball player, who ended up playing the villainous sensei, andJun Katsumura, a former professional wrestler, who was cast as the sensei’sbodyguard.Even in the best of circumstances, the relationship between the Japanese and theChinese can be tricky. Fist of Fury was the first time a Hong Kong studio hadhired Japanese actors to play the villains in an overtly anti-Japanese movie. Toavoid having their two Japanese guests balk at what was being asked of them, theChinese hit upon a simple solution: they never gave them a copy of thescreenplay. “We were acting but we didn’t have a script at hand,” remembers JunKatsumura. “There was no plan but I’d heard something about what the story wasabout. I understood what to do.”Director Lo Wei gave Hashimoto and Katsumura their marching orders. “He told usto be odious. That is what he ordered us to do,” Riki Hashimoto says. “I mainlyplayed villains in Japanese films, so I used that experience. I tried to make mycharacter as evil as I could.”  They decided to approach the project aloofly andsimply do their duty, consoling themselves with the thought that no one in Japanwould ever want to see a movie that cast their people in such a negative light.Just as Bruce had been stunned by the impoverished conditions in rural Thailand,the Japanese felt filming for Golden Harvest was like slumming in the ThirdWorld. “The location was run-down. And I thought, ‘Can you really shoot here?’ ”Katsumura recalls. “It was that bad.”The Japanese actors were also shocked by how rough-and-tumble the actionchoreography was. “When you have a fight in Japan, it’s like dancing at acertain tempo. It has a flow and is easy to understand,” Hashimoto says. “Overthere they just do it directly. They don’t care if it hurt or somebody gotinjured. I admired that. It makes it very hot-blooded.” Jun Katsumura learnedthis lesson the hard way when he was choreographing his scene with Bruce. “Hetold us about his martial arts and took his shirt off. He played with hismuscles and showed me his tricks,” Katsumura says. “Then I did my karame—karameis when you restrain an assailant. Then he jumped to his feet, and he waskicking and punching for real! They really hit each other in Hong Kong movies. Ithought you had to be careful.”What didn’t surprise them was the conflict between Bruce and Lo Wei. “It iscommon, also in Japan, for the director and the lead actor to argue. That wasn’tstrange,” Katsumura reflects.Image [../images/sec.jpg]After the phenomenal response for The Big Boss, both Bruce and Lo Wei jockeyedin the press to claim sole ownership of its success. Lo Wei gave himself thenickname “The Million Dollar Director.” He also told reporters that he taughtBruce how to fight in front of the camera. After reading Lo Wei’s quotes in thenewspapers, Bruce stormed onto the set to confront his director in front of theentire cast and crew, including a young stuntman by the name of Jackie Chan.“You called yourself ‘The Dragon’s mentor,’ ” Bruce yelled, shaking his head infury.“The quote was out of context,” Lo Wei said.“It’s in the paper, isn’t it?” Bruce said with a dangerous edge in his voice.“I never said I taught you how to fight,” said Lo, waving his hands in anattempt to calm down his star. “I only said I showed you how to fight for thecameras. The skill, the talent, that’s yours, Bruce. At most I, ah, gave you alittle polish.”Jackie Chan and the rest of the stuntmen watched in discomfort, afraid theargument might come to blows. As the two men stared at each other, thedirector’s wife, Gladys Lo, stepped in between them. She placed her petite handgently on Bruce’s shoulder.“Please, Little Dragon,” she said, “don’t take what my husband says soseriously. There is no insult in his words. Everyone knows that you are themaster, and we are all just students!”Bruce’s gaze softened and his shoulders relaxed. Lo Wei slowly took a sidewaysstep that placed his bulk behind the slim body of his wife.“All right, Madame Lo,” Lee said finally. “Out of respect for you, I’ll forgetthat this happened. But if your husband ever talks to reporters about me again,I’ll give him a lesson on how to fight.”Bruce walked off to the side of the set, shaking his head. When he was out ofearshot, Lo Wei waved his hand anxiously at the rest of the crew. “Was that athreat?” he asked, his face betraying a mix of fear and annoyance. “Did hethreaten me? All of you are witnesses.”Seeing Lo Wei hiding behind his wife, the crew turned away from him in disgustand resumed their previous conversations.After this argument, Bruce banned Lo Wei from directing any of his fight scenesin Fist of Fury. He decided he would handle them all himself to make certain noone could ever again take credit for his work. This posed a problem. HanYing-Chieh, who had served as action director and also played the villain in TheBig Boss, had been hired as the fight choreographer for Fist of Fury.“Technically, Han Ying-Chieh was still the chief choreographer,” remembers ZebraPan, who was a stuntman on the set. “Then we all came in to shoot that openingscene, the one where Bruce beats up all the Japanese in their dojo. HanYing-Chieh says, ‘Okay, Bruce, let’s try this . . . ,’ and Bruce goes: ‘No, howabout this . . . ?’ And for the first time started to really do Bruce Lee, to doall the stuff with multiple kicks and the nunchaku and everything. We were justknocked out by it and after that Han Ying-Chieh just kept quiet.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]As Hashimoto and Katsumura discovered quickly, Bruce wanted to make filmfighting as close to real fighting as possible by eliminating any fakery. Hedidn’t want to use camera angles and depth of field to give the illusion of ablow being struck; he actually wanted to hit his costars—action cinéma vérité.As a consequence, Bruce preferred to cast martial artists rather than actors inhis movies. For the part of the Russian wrestler bad guy, he picked Bob Baker,one of his Oakland students. Baker had no acting experience, but he could take apunch. “We did actually hit each other in most of the fight scenes,” Bakerrecalls. “We were really sparring.”This quest for realism extended to the smallest details. Bruce choreographed amoment in his fight with Baker where he is trapped between Bob’s legs and has tobite him to get free. This was a pedagogical moment from Bruce’s Jeet Kune Dophilosophy: do whatever is necessary to win. The trouble with the scene wasBaker wasn’t giving a realistic enough reaction to Bruce’s bite. Baker says, “Iwasn’t an actor. I didn’t know how to respond to it. He really had to bite me.”Bob was so surprised he yanked his leg away with all his might. “I just aboutpulled Bruce’s teeth out. He put his hand over his mouth.”Perhaps as payback, Bruce set up his student for a real-life test of skill. Atthe end of a late night of filming, Bruce was leaving the set with Bob by hisside. One of the Chinese stuntmen came up to Bruce and challenged him, saying hedidn’t think Bruce’s kung fu was as good as the movies made it look. FollowingChinese kung fu custom, Bruce said, “I am the master. If you want to fight meyou have to fight my student first.” Unfortunately for Bob, the conversation wastaking place in Cantonese and he didn’t understand a word of it. Suddenly, thestuntman lunged at Bob, who despite his surprise reacted immediately and deckedthe stuntman, ending the fight in one blow.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Fist of Fury was the first and only time Bruce shared an on-screen kiss with acostar, the twenty-year-old actress Nora Miao. She had been hired by GoldenHarvest a year earlier after responding to a newspaper ad recruiting actors.There were only two other actresses under contract at the fledgling studio, andexecutives wanted to groom Nora for swordswoman roles. (The two stereotypicalparts for young actresses were either passive love interests or swordswomen.) LoWei took Nora under his wing, eventually adopting her as his goddaughter.She first appeared alongside Bruce in The Big Boss. She was visiting the setduring a break from filming another movie, and Lo Wei decided to give her awalk-on role as the ice-lolly hawker, whom Bruce protects from some thugsharassing her. It was her first time meeting Bruce face-to-face, but they hadheard of each other. While Bruce was in America, Nora had been a close teenagefriend of his brother Robert. “I knew his family well,” Nora says. “Robert and Iwent dancing, partying and hung out together with his mum and sister. I visitedhis home often. They often mentioned Bruce Lee.” When they finally met, Norasays, “We felt that we had known each other all our lives even at first sight.Of course, he had heard of me. It was like ‘Oh my younger brother’s buddy hasbecome a star.’ ”When Robert became a teen pop sensation, he was romantically linked in the pressto Nora. It is not clear if they were in fact boyfriend and girlfriend or justpals, but after Fist of Fury’s release the tabloids became enamored of the lovetriangle story line—older brother returns home and poaches his younger brother’sgirl. Hong Kong film historian Bey Logan has joked, “Maybe there was a Kennedything: Marilyn Monroe, Robert, and Jack.”If there was any sexual spark between Bruce and Nora, it’s not evident oncelluloid. Their on-screen kiss may be the least convincing in film history.Image [../images/sec.jpg]While Bruce was in America honing his stage persona, a younger generation offuture kung fu action stars was perfecting their entertainment skills thetraditional Chinese way. Boys whose parents were so poor they couldn’t afford toraise them were sold to the China Drama Academy where they studied CantoneseOpera under unbelievably harsh conditions. Training could go on for as long aseighteen hours a day and included weapons training, acrobatics, kung fu,singing, and acting.The most talented of the China Drama Academy’s younger students were organizedinto a performance troupe called the Seven Little Fortunes. As the boys grewolder and less cute, they were replaced and had to look for work elsewhere. Manyof them migrated into the movie business to work as stuntmen.The Little Fortunes were resentful and jealous of the buzz surrounding Bruce Leeuntil they saw The Big Boss. “We were prepared to hate the film. We reallywanted to,” Jackie Chan says. “After all, this overseas Chinese guy had come inout of nowhere, was making hundreds of times our salaries, and had Hong Kongeating out of the palm of his hand. We wanted to, but we couldn’t. The film waseverything the movies we were making weren’t. And even though The Big Boss maynot seem very impressive today, for us then, it was a revelation. When wegathered in the evenings to drink and talk, the conversation always ended upturning the same way: what did Lee have that we didn’t? What was the secret ofhis success?”When word went out that Golden Harvest was looking for stuntmen for Bruce’ssecond movie, the Little Fortunes clamored to study the secret of his success upclose. Jackie was hired as a bit player; Yuen Wah, another ex–Little Fortune,served as Bruce’s stunt double, performing all the acrobatic flips that Brucehad never learned how to do; and Sammo Hung—the Big Brother of the troupe, bothin terms of status and physical girth—was hired by Golden Harvest as the stuntcoordinator. Prideful and pugnacious, Sammo Hung was not content to simply watchfrom a distance. In a story that has become legendary, Sammo apparently ran intoBruce in a hallway at Golden Harvest during filming. As they got to talkingabout kung fu, they started to argue about certain finer points, and then, asmartial artists are wont to do, they began to show each other certaintechniques. It wasn’t quite a full-out challenge match, but there was some lightcontact involved. Sammo walked away convinced that Bruce was the genuinearticle, but his pride wouldn’t allow him to say that Bruce was better. “Sammosays it was even, but there were no witnesses, so who can confirm or deny?”Jackie Chan diplomatically notes.Hong Kong was light years behind Hollywood in terms of screenwriting, directing,and production values, but its one competitive advantage was this group ofstuntmen who were as physically talented as they were courageous. Just as he hadas a teenager in Hong Kong and again as a young man in Seattle, Bruce began toform the stuntmen into his gang, winning them over with his charisma, loyalty,and generosity.Instead of retreating with the bosses, he ate his lunches with the stuntmen,charming them with off-color jokes and his refusal of special treatment. “Leewas always given something more gourmet. He would ask the production management:‘Why is that person eating “marinated pork rice” while I get “marinated chickenliver”?’ ” remembers Henry Wong, a production assistant. “The person from theproduction management said, ‘Oh, because you’re the boss.’ Lee got a bit angrywith him and said, ‘Don’t talk about me being the boss or not, I can eat whateveryone else eats. There’s no need to treat me differently. Next time—this isthe last time—don’t treat me special.’ ”Even after filming ended, he continued to socialize with the stuntmen. One dayhe ran into Jackie Chan on the streets of Tsim Sha Tsui. “Where are youheading?” Bruce asked.“Oh Bruce, I’m going to play bowling,” Jackie replied.“Can I go with you?”“What? Yes!”Jackie had intended to take the bus, but he immediately hailed a taxi for HongKong’s newest superstar. When they got out of the taxi, Jackie felt like a hero.The crowd started screaming, “Bruce Lee! Bruce Lee!” Jackie immediately acted asBruce’s bodyguard. “Go away, go, go go,” Jackie shouted at them. “No autographs!No photos!”In the bowling alley, Bruce sat down in his bell-bottom jeans and high-heeledCuban boots and watched Jackie roll strike after strike.“Do you want to play?” Jackie asked.“Jackie, I think I’m leaving,” Bruce said, unwilling to be upstaged by astuntman. “I have to meet someone.”“Ah, okay,” Jackie replied, disappointed.Jackie Chan was not the only stuntman to serve unofficially as Bruce’sbodyguard. Ip Chun, the son of Bruce’s master, Ip Man, recalls: “Lee always wentjogging in the mornings and before evenings. He would always go with severalstuntmen and would never go alone, because he would often encounter those whowanted to challenge him, and he would ask the stuntmen to take the challengesand he would go home himself.”Like with any good gang leader, Bruce offered the stuntmen protection andsupport. He paid their medical bills. “If a fighter was injured and the companydidn’t compensate enough, Bruce would give him one or two thousand Hong Kongdollars, which was a lot at the time,” recalls Ip Chun. He secured highersalaries. “When times were tough, he’d tell the boss—and we’d all get a raise,”says Angela Yao Ming, one of his costars in Enter the Dragon. And he evenpromised he would bring some of them back with him to America. “He said he wasgoing to take ten of us to Hollywood,” recalls Yuen Wah, his stunt double. Likewith any good gang member, the stuntmen offered Bruce their undying loyalty.“All the kung fu stuntmen in Hong Kong really worshipped him,” says Robert Chan,a childhood friend.If the stuntmen were like his schoolboy followers, then his bosses were theteachers he had defied as a teenager. “He got along really well with thelow-level people on set. But he was extremely impolite to his boss,” Bolo Yeung,who costarred in Enter the Dragon, says. “In the real world, it’s always thereverse: kiss up to your boss, and act like a tyrant to the people below you.Lee was just the opposite. He was kind to those below him, and mean to thoseabove him.” Raymond Chow was like the school principal. “Bruce used to roar athis superiors. He’d shout, ‘Raymond Chow, get over here!’ Bruce wouldn’t evenlook him in the eyes as they spoke.” Lo Wei was the PE instructor who hadswitched Bruce with a blade of grass. Lo Wei whipped Bruce with words, mockinghim behind his back as “The Master of Anxiety.” Bruce frequently confronted LoWei and challenged his authority. “After Lo Wei had given everyone their basicinstructions for the scene, he liked to listen to the racing on the radio,” saysLam Ching Ying, a stuntman. “He’d be sitting in his director’s chair, gettingall excited over his horse winning or losing. Finally Bruce storms over to him:‘What are you doing? Okay, everybody go home!’ In fact we didn’t wrap but Brucemade his point!”Bruce was so frustrated with Lo Wei that he began plotting how to get out fromunder his thumb. While he was acting and choreographing his fight scenes, healso managed to find time to study every aspect of the filmmaking process,asking countless questions. He wanted to be in complete control over everyaspect of his career. “His ultimate goal was to be a film producer, like RaymondChow,” says Chaplin Chang, who worked on Way of the Dragon and Enter the Dragon.Fist of Fury was the last movie on Bruce’s contract with Golden Harvest. Hisplan was to direct, produce, and star in his next Hong Kong film. To realize hisoutsized ambitions, he needed Fist of Fury to smash the box office record of TheBig Boss.Image [../images/sec.jpg]The house was packed at the Queen’s Theatre for Fist of Fury’s premiere on March22, 1972. If The Big Boss tapped into Chinese anxiety about their place in theworld, Fist of Fury was a pure adrenaline shot of patriotism into their hearts.When Bruce delivered the line “The Chinese are not the sick men of Asia,” theentire audience as one people rose to their feet and howled their approval. “Ohmy God, in one screening they tore out the seats and threw them around they wereall so excited,” Nancy Kwan recalls.Fist of Fury introduced several elements that became inseparable from Bruce’siconic image. It was the first time he demonstrated the nunchaku, the weapon thepress would refer to as “Bruce Lee’s singing rods of death.” It was the firsttime he introduced his catlike screeches while attacking. He adopted theexaggerated emotional acting style of Japanese samurai films (chambara). And heperfected his movie fighting style: a series of high chain kicks punctuated bydramatic pauses to build tension.Interestingly, none of these was particularly Chinese: nunchakus were anOkinawan weapon, unknown previously in China; chambara was Japanese; high chainkicks were used in Korean Tae Kwon Do, not Chinese kung fu; and his animalscreeching was something he made up himself. “When people asked him why heshouted like this,” recalls one of his stuntmen, “he said, ‘This is what I doduring a real fight.’ ” But it made no difference to the Chinese crowds. He haddefended their honor on-screen and therefore in their hearts. He representedsomething new—the way the Chinese wanted to be, not who they were—strong,powerful, cocky, and utterly fearless.The movie dominated the Hong Kong box office. Within thirteen days, it toppedThe Big Boss’s record of HK$3.5 million and in its first month grossed awhopping HK$4.3 million. From there it swept across Asia. In the Philippines, itran nonstop for more than six months, and the government was eventuallypressured into limiting the importation of foreign films to protect the localmovie industry. On its opening night in Singapore, excited fans filled thestreets outside cinemas causing such extensive traffic jams that officialspostponed its release for a week until arrangements could be made to corral thecrowds. When it finally was shown, scalpers were selling $1 tickets for $15.Two years later on July 20, 1974, Fist of Fury was even released in Japan. Itdid remarkably well considering the content. No one was more surprised than hisJapanese costars, Riki Hashimoto and Jun Katsumura. “The story of Fist of Furyitself made fools of the Japanese. So I thought that it would not be shown inJapan. But Enter the Dragon and Way of the Dragon were big hits in Japan, sothey distributed Fist of Fury,” Jun Katsumura says. “There are many youngJapanese who are crazy about Bruce Lee. If I’d know he’d become such asuperstar, I would have been friendlier with him and fooled around more. Iregret that I didn’t.”"},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f0350-01.jpg]Bruce and Betty Ting Pei on the Hong Kong Colosseum studio set for Way of theDragon, June 1972. (David Tadman)"},{"pageContent":"NINETEENCONCORDIf you want to know what is in a poor man’s heart, see what he buys when he getsrich. Bruce was by no means wealthy at this point. He was a contract player andhad been paid a flat fee, $15,000, for his work on The Big Boss and Fist ofFury. Most of that money was used to pay off old debts. It was Raymond Chow andGolden Harvest who reaped the rewards of their gamble on Bruce. The Big Bossalone earned over $16 million in 2017 US dollars. When a reporter asked Run RunShaw about his decision not to sign Lee, he shrugged gloomily. “He was just anactor. How could I know?” Bruce was not rich, but his credit was good. “I’mreally enjoying the position I’m at now,” Bruce rejoiced to friends. “I could godown to any bank right now and get a loan for as much as I want, up to sixmillion dollars, with just my signature.”The first thing he wanted to buy with his unlimited line of credit was control.On December 1, 1971, Bruce and Raymond signed a contract establishing a newsatellite company called Concord Productions. Bruce derived the name from theRoman goddess of harmony, Concordia, and not, as some have suggested, thesupersonic jet Concorde, which debuted in 1969. The symbol for the company wasthe red and gold yin/yang sign Bruce had used for his Jeet Kune Do studio in LosAngeles. Raymond Chow and Bruce were the two halves of the Taoist whole: Brucewas in charge of the creative side, Chow the business operations. Profits wouldbe split 50/50.The agreement was not the first of its kind in Hong Kong. Raymond Chow had setup similar “satellite” company deals with Jimmy Wang Yu and Lo Wei in order toentice them to leave Shaw Bros. for Golden Harvest. But those had been keptquiet to avoid further antagonizing Run Run Shaw. Bruce’s deal was the first tobe made public. When other stars heard, they clamored for similar arrangements,marking the beginning of the end for Shaw’s contract system. As with kung fumovies, Bruce popularized a trend that had already begun before he returned toHong Kong.With a new company came a new office. For the first time in his life, Bruce wasnow a white-collar worker. Bruce’s office at Golden Harvest’s studios onHammerhill Road was a former costume and set design closet, maybe 130 squarefeet. He installed a desk, chairs, and a set of Olympic barbells so he couldconstantly pump weights. To remind him of his lean past, he kept on his shelf abroken pair of glasses he had Scotch-taped as a young man in America because hecouldn’t afford to have them repaired. He also pinned to one wall a poster oftwo vultures with the caption: “Patience my Ass. I’m gunna kill something.” Onanother wall, he had installed wallpaper worthy of the Playboy Mansion—drawingsof hundreds of bare-breasted women of all different ethnicities.From Steve McQueen, Bruce learned that being a celebrity wasn’t just about bigbox office but looking like a star in real life. “Image is important,” McQueentold him. “To be successful, you have to look successful.” Fashion conscioussince he was a teen, Bruce went on a shopping spree. “He liked clothes andenjoyed buying them,” Linda says. In Hollywood, he had burnished his Orientalotherness by wearing kaftans, dashikis, and Nehru jackets. In Hong Kong, heemphasized his Westernized persona by sporting Elvis-style sunglasses, brightflowered shirts, big-lapeled leather jackets, and bell-bottom jeans, whichhelped partially conceal the four-inch platform shoes he wore to make himselfseem taller. For special occasions, he bought a floor-length mink coat. It wasthe 1970s.Status-conscious Hong Kongers, who often live in tiny apartments, flash theirwealth with luxury cars. It had broken Bruce’s heart to sell his Porsche. AfterFist of Fury, he acquired a red Mercedes 305SL convertible. Since Bruce had nomoney of his own, Raymond Chow advanced Bruce the funds out of Concord’s futureearnings. “Raymond was Bruce Lee’s piggy bank,” says Andre Morgan. Bruce wouldgo much deeper into debt for his next major purchase.When Bruce, Linda, and the kids first moved to Hong Kong, Golden Harvest putthem up in an apartment at 2 Man Wan Road, Sunlight Garden, Kowloon—afifteen-minute drive from Bruce’s childhood home. For a Hong Kong family in1971, the flat was quite spacious: it had two bedrooms, a living and diningroom, and a Chinese kitchen. But compared to his Bel Air home, it was tiny. “Alot of the modern conveniences I had been used to, such as a washer and dryer,were missing,” Linda says. “Our clothes were washed by hand and hung out on thewindow on bamboo poles to dry.”  The apartment was situated on the thirteenthfloor and the elevator rarely worked. Linda and Bruce used this as an exerciseopportunity—running up and down the stairs. “Our neighbors thought we were a bitstrange,” she says.Adding to Linda’s feeling of being cramped was Wu Ngan, his childhood friend.Bruce moved him into the apartment as his manservant. When Wu Ngan married, hiswife joined as well. As the live-in servants they cleaned, cooked, and washedthe clothes by hand. While the arrangement may have made Linda uncomfortable,Bruce was quite proud of it. “All the years I’ve been with Linda, she was alwaysbusy,” Bruce bragged to friends. “Now that we can afford to hire help, I finallygot her to take it easy. We have enough servants and maids to do the housework.”A cramped apartment was fine for a contract actor, but not for Hong Kong’sbiggest box office star. After Fist of Fury’s success, Raymond secured a loanfor Bruce to purchase what passes for a palace in densely packed Hong Kong, a5,700-square-foot, two-story, eleven-room, gray concrete home on 41 CumberlandRoad in the tony suburb of Kowloon Tong—one of the very few neighborhoods withfreestanding houses instead of apartment high-rises. Like all the other housesin the area, it was cordoned off by eight-foot stone walls and a wrought irongate as if the neighborhood was preparing for the Communist hordes to invade.The furnishings in Bruce and Linda’s home were a mix of Western and Chinesemodern, in beaming bright colors, and carefully collected pieces of Chinese art.Bruce had an extensive collection of martial arts weapons he loved to displayand demonstrate. The huge front yard of Bruce’s new home had a Japanese gardenand an extended driveway for his Mercedes and any other car he might add to hiscollection. While not the biggest house on the block, it was palatial by HongKong standards. (In 2011, it was put on the market for US$23 million.)Having leapt up the social ladder, Bruce and Linda worked to situate theirchildren in their new city and place in life. Two-year-old Shannon was sent to ahigh-end nursery school to prepare her for private kindergarten entrance exams.By the age of three, she was wearing a uniform, carrying a box bag, and learningChinese characters.Bruce wanted to send six-year-old Brandon to his old school La Salle. But he wasafraid they wouldn’t accept his son because they had expelled him. He appealedto Raymond Chow to accompany him to La Salle to plead his case.“Why don’t you just go?” Raymond asked him. “I mean, now that you’re very wellknown.”“Yes, I’m very famous,” Bruce said, “and infamous.”“What happened?” Raymond asked.“I was very well known for fighting,” he admitted, before shaving the truth abit. “Actually, it was not all my fault. A lot of times, people picked on meand, you know, I just had to fight.”“So nothing to do with your son’s schooling?”“No, no, no, no. La Salle is very straight. The brothers are very strict,” Brucepleaded. “So, if you come with me, my son will have a better chance.”Raymond relented and went with Bruce to La Salle. The Catholic Brothers turnedout to be overjoyed to see him. They had heard of his accomplishments and werevery welcoming to their prodigal son. Brandon was admitted without any mentionof the sins of the father. “See? All these people take me seriously now,” Brucedelightedly remarked to Raymond.It wasn’t long, however, before Brandon was following in his father’s foot (andfist) steps. Within a few weeks, he was already getting into fights. “Brandon isthe biggest and only white kid in his class. And we’re already gettingcomplaints that he’s beating up on the other kids,” Bruce proudly told hisfriend Mito Uyehara. Mito noticed that Linda was “rather perturbed by Bruce’sattitude at that moment.”Having achieved success, Bruce invited his mother-in-law to visit them in HongKong. “She was so proud of me,” Bruce smiled, “because wherever we went, we weregiven the V.I.P. treatment. I guess that’s the first time in her life she hadthat kind of attention.”Bruce looked at his life, and it was good. With a daughter in preschool, a sonat La Salle, a devoted wife, and a flourishing acting career, he had in manyways re-created his own childhood—and one-upped his father in the process. Hisfather was a well-known Cantonese Opera actor; Bruce was the biggest movie starin Hong Kong. His father had taken care of the family in a well-apportionedapartment with servants; Bruce was living in a mansion with servants. “He usedto call me at two or three in the morning,” says Nancy Kwan, “and tell me howgood he was feeling and how finally he was making money and he could buyanything he wanted.”It was all coming together for him. But if he wanted to be like every othersuccessful Hong Kong man—like his father and grandfather—he needed one morething.Image [../images/sec.jpg]On March 21, 1972, Bruce, Linda, and Raymond went out for a celebratory dinnerat Hugo’s restaurant in the Hyatt Regency Hotel. It was Linda’s birthday and thenight before the premiere of Fist of Fury. They were all filled with anxiety,anticipation, and high hopes. As they were leaving the hotel, they bumped intothe sultry twenty-five-year-old Taiwanese actress Betty Ting Pei.Betty had recently returned from a six-month stay in Switzerland where she hadmarried and quickly divorced a handsome Swiss man. “I was not that happy, butnot brokenhearted either,” Betty says. “It’s because I didn’t know what lovewas.”Raymond, who while at Shaw Bros. had signed Betty to a five-year contract, madethe introductions. “Bruce was very happy to look at, you know, look at me,”Betty smiles. “The feeling was quick contact.”Despite the initial sparks, or perhaps because of them, the married movie starwaited nearly two weeks before making contact again. And he couldn’t even do ithimself. “Raymond called me at the President Hotel and said, ‘Bruce and I aredownstairs in the Chin Chin Bar,’ ” Betty remembers. “I was very excited. Forsure he likes me, right? But it’s funny. I didn’t really want to go out, becauseI had no makeup. I didn’t know what to wear.“When Bruce first approached me, he offered me a part in his next movie, YellowFaced Tiger,” Betty says. It must have been an enticing offer. Betty’s contractwith Shaw Bros. had expired, she hadn’t worked in the past six months sinceleaving for Switzerland, and she had expenses. “We didn’t make lots of moneyback then, but I lived like a movie star,” Betty says. “I drove a Mustang.Everybody knew who I was.”Having been in show business for a long time, she says she wasn’t naive. “Ididn’t believe he wanted to work with me. I think to myself he probably justwants to be boyfriend and girlfriend.” One clue may have been the body language.“We’re talking and right away he’s holding my hand and telling me how pretty Iam.” Betty reveals that the charismatic star didn’t need to work so hard. “Hewas so famous. He had done so much better than me. I didn’t feel like I couldcompare with him,” she says. “There was no human being like Bruce. It isdifficult to explain except that I knew that he got me. He got me right away,just like he could control me right away. I was like, ‘I’m with him.’ ”Betty ran back to her room to call her mother. “Guess who I met? Lee LittleDragon!” But her mother was unimpressed. “She just ignored me. She didn’t care.She didn’t know who Bruce was.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]As the flashy new kid in school, the media couldn’t get enough of Bruce. Thepress coverage during this honeymoon period was so overwhelming that it led topress coverage about the press coverage. A special article in The Daily Newsreported with some chagrin, “In two short weeks in December [1971], four specialreports of Lee Little Dragon were published, and his face appeared on the coverof magazines no less than seven times. Though many stories and rumors about LeeLittle Dragon have become common knowledge, they are still not enough to satisfythe fans, who are continually interested in more reporting on his background. Asa result, almost any story with any connection to him is seen as valuable.”One of the stories the media couldn’t resist was the supposed bad blood betweenBruce Lee and Jimmy Wang Yu, Hong Kong’s two biggest action stars working underthe same roof. “Wang Yu was the established force,” Andre Morgan says, “BruceLee was the new gunslinger coming to town.”  The tabloids feverishly reportedhow they were on the verge of setting up a challenge match to see who was thebetter fighter. “Each is King in his own jungle,” wrote Fanfare, a Singaporenewspaper. “It’s like persuading two proud tigers to live in the same cagepeacefully.” Raymond Chow, as a savvy promoter, did nothing to discourage thisstory line. “All of this stuff about threatening to punch each other out,”Morgan says, “whether they really intended to or not, it didn’t matter, becauseit sure made for good copy, didn’t it? It got the fans’ adrenaline pumping.”Behind the scenes, they did in fact talk trash about each other. “Bruce used tomouth off about Jimmy. It was always, ‘Well, he’s not really a martial artist.I’m a real martial artist,’ ” Morgan recalls. “Wang Yu’s dismissive was, ‘I’mthe number one star and I’m an all-around athlete. I was an Olympic swimmer. Ican do swords. I can do martial arts. I ride horses. What’s the big deal? I doeverything.’ ”While Raymond saw the value in hyping the rivalry, he didn’t want his two mostvaluable stars actually coming to blows. He carefully made sure Bruce and Jimmywere never in the same room together. “Raymond didn’t want Bruce to be in theposition where he had to look Wang Yu in the face and confront him as to who wasthe biggest, baddest gunslinger,” Morgan says. “There was a lot of testosteroneflying around back then.”Wang Yu had another way to put down Bruce. While The Big Boss and Fist of Furymay have done better than The Chinese Boxer at the box office, Jimmy hadwritten, directed, and starred in his movie. In contrast, Bruce had merely beenthe actor in two movies that borrowed heavily from Jimmy’s work. As far as Jimmywas concerned, Bruce was riding on his coattails. “The Chinese Boxer was myidea. I wrote the script. It was the first kung fu movie,” Jimmy said. “Becauseof it, a lot of directors copied my idea and wrote very similar scripts. Sotherefore Bruce Lee had the opportunity to come back to Hong Kong to make asuccessful picture.”A man as proud and competitive as Bruce Lee couldn’t let this stand unanswered.After the incredible success of Lo Wei and Bruce’s first two movies, RaymondChow naturally wanted to team them up again for a third. The project he set intomotion was called Yellow Faced Tiger. In Fist of Fury, Bruce had played ChenZhen, the student of the legendary kung fu master Huo Yuanjia. For thisfollow-up movie, Raymond wanted to cast Bruce as Huo Yuanjia, whose nickname was“Yellow Faced Tiger” because he suffered from jaundice. Bruce initially agreedbut very quickly began having second thoughts about working with Lo Wei again.The director had been telling anybody who would listen that he was responsiblefor Bruce’s success. Jimmy Wang Yu was telling anybody who would listen that hewas a real filmmaker while Bruce was merely a copycat actor. Making another filmwith Lo Wei would just confirm their criticisms.The solution was both simple and ambitious. Bruce would write, direct, and starin his own movie. For good measure, and to best Jimmy, he’d compose the musictoo. If that wasn’t enough, he’d set the movie in Rome, so it would be the firstHong Kong movie to ever film in the West. The Little Dragon decided to call hisdirectorial debut Enter the Dragon for obvious branding reasons. It was notuntil Bruce decided to use Enter the Dragon as the title for his first WarnerBros. movie that the name was changed to Way of the Dragon.Bruce first had to untangle himself from Yellow Faced Tiger and Lo Wei.According to Lo Wei’s recollection of events, he had initially been preparing tomake a movie with Sam Hui, one of Bruce’s close friends, when Raymond Chowordered him off that project and onto Yellow Faced Tiger with Bruce. “I droppedmy original plans and hurried to write Lee’s script,” Lo Wei claims. After thescript was finished and arrangements had already been made to film in Japan,Raymond called Lo Wei to inform him that Bruce no longer wanted to make themovie. A meeting between the star and his director was set up at Her Ladyshiprestaurant.“We’ll be underway soon,” Lo Wei said to Bruce. “The visas are all approved.”“The thing is,” Bruce replied, “this script isn’t so great.”“What do you think the problem is?” Lo Wei asked.“I think the script is the problem.”“What part of the script seems to be the problem then?” Lo Wei asked.“The whole thing.”“You need to think this through,” Lo Wei said, testily. “For The Big Boss I hadto do things roughly. In Bangkok, that terrible place, we slapped the filmtogether, but we still made money! Fist of Fury, we were in the same boat, andwe made even more money. For Fist of Fury we didn’t even have a script! We onlyhad three sheets of paper for the whole film! Now, this script is very wellwritten! I think it will be an absolutely fine film, so I am not worried aboutit.”“I still think the script doesn’t work,” Bruce said.“Then we’ll do it like this: you tell me which parts you don’t like and we canchange them! You’re the star. We can change the script so you’re happy with it.I want you to be happy with it too. All we need to do is talk it over!”“I still can’t put my finger on which part I don’t like.”“You still don’t know?!” Lo Wei erupted. “The 3rd scene? Or the 5th scene? The7th scene? The 8th? Where’s the problem with the dialogue? Is it the plot? Theambiance? The development of the story? Come on, you have to have a reason! Youcan’t just say there’s something wrong, you need to back it up.”“I need to go home and look it over again,” Bruce replied. “I’ll tell youtomorrow.”“You need to write it out for me,” Lo Wei jousted, trying to pin Bruce down. “Wewill change the script according to what you think.”“I’ll have it for you by tomorrow,” he said. “No, not tomorrow, three days. Giveme three days.”Bruce left abruptly, and Lo Wei headed back to the office. Three days passed,then a week, then two. Bruce didn’t come by the office or call Lo Wei, whorealized something was wrong. He asked around and heard that Bruce wanted todirect his own movie. Furious, he decided to scrap the entire project, butGolden Harvest had already invested in it—arrangements had been made—so Raymondinsisted that Lo Wei find a replacement for Bruce.“I want Jimmy Wang Yu,” Lo Wei said, no doubt aware of how much this wouldirritate Bruce.“Wang is so busy!” Chow replied, trying to cut Lo Wei off.“Just try him!” Lo Wei insisted. “If you say I am the one directing, he’llprobably do it.”Chow flew to Taiwan where Jimmy was filming another movie. He signed on. Whenthe press heard that Lo Wei was going to Japan with Wang Yu, not Lee, a reportershowed up to Lo Wei’s office to probe this juicy angle.“Bruce Lee won’t be going?” the reporter asked and then laughed at Lo Wei. “Howcan you make a movie without Bruce Lee?”“I was already making movies before I met Lee!” Lo Wei flared, and the mediagleefully ran with the story of an acrimonious split between the Million DollarDuo. Bruce Lee was out and Jimmy Wang Yu was in.When Bruce read the newspapers, he was furious. He had been dragging his feetbut hadn’t actually turned down the project. They had replaced him behind hisback and made it public, causing him to lose face. He didn’t want to work withLo Wei again, but he also didn’t want Jimmy Wang Yu to either. Their movie wouldbe competing with his. What if Yellow Faced Tiger did better at the box officethan Way of the Dragon? People would say that Lo Wei was responsible for Bruce’ssuccess.Bruce decided he wanted to make both films and completely undercut Jimmy WangYu. He called up Lo Wei and asked why he had been replaced.“I couldn’t get ahold of you. You were supposed to get in touch with me afterthree days, remember?” Lo Wei pointedly said. “This is the first time that Ihave heard from you in a month!”“I never said I didn’t want to do the film.”“But you didn’t tell me this for close to a month now!” Lo Wei shouted.“Why did you choose Jimmy Wang? Was that Chow’s idea?” Bruce asked, alreadysuspicious of Raymond’s motives.“No! You are a celebrity! Me? I am a famous director. I have self-respect. Youtold me three days. You didn’t contact me for almost a month. It’s tasteless. Ididn’t know what you were thinking, so all I could do was replace you.”“Are you trying to make me look bad?” Bruce asked.“No, I am not trying to make you look bad. I know you’re about to start filmingyour own movie. I know. At most, I replaced you. Can we just forget about it? Ifno one brings it up, then it’s not a problem.”“Don’t you think you and Wang don’t go together well?”“Of course not,” Lo Wei said.“I think you switching me out for Wang means you’re a ‘low gamble,’ ” Brucesaid, using a Cantonese insult. “How about if we do it like this: I’ll go withyou to Japan. You won’t replace me. I’ll be in your film.”“This won’t do. You think you can just ignore me for weeks. I have alreadypromised someone else. I can’t just switch again now. How does that make melook?”According to Lo Wei, Bruce lost his infamous temper and started cursing him.“Now, Bruce Lee, consider your status in society: you’re a movie star, acultural worker, how can you curse at me this way?” Lo Wei scolded in apatronizing tone.Bruce cursed him one last time before slamming down the phone.That argument ended the most successful director-star partnership in Hong Kongfilm history. Afterward they avoided each other whenever possible and never metface-to-face. If they ran into each other at the office or on a movie set, theywould turn their back and walk away.Lo Wei and Jimmy Wang Yu went to Japan to make their movie. Bruce Lee went toRome to make his. It was a showdown to see who was Golden Harvest’s biggeststar."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f0362-01.jpg]Bruce and Nora Miao in Rome for Way of the Dragon, May 1972.

(David Tadman)"},{"pageContent":"TWENTYSPAGHETTI EASTERNWay of the Dragon was the first screenplay Bruce wrote by himself. The biggesthurdle he faced was linguistic. “He found that he had left Hong Kong so longago, he had a little trouble writing the script in Chinese,” says Chi Yao Chang,the assistant director on the film. Bruce joked about being caught between twoworlds, “It is quite funny really. I bought this English-Chinese dictionaryoriginally to help me find the suitable English words when I first went to theUnited States when I was 18. Now I find that I have to use it to find theChinese words which I have in mind.”  To help his creative process, Bruce firstdictated his ideas onto a tape recorder mostly in English. Then he and Chi YaoChang translated these oral notes into Chinese scenes as the script developed.Bruce’s initial story concept for Way of the Dragon was based on The Warrior,the TV series he had pitched to Ted Ashley—a nineteenth-century Chinese kung fumaster flees from the failing Qing Dynasty to San Francisco where he protectsChinese immigrants from exploitation. Ironically, just like Warner Bros., Bruceended up rejecting his idea. Concern over the cost of filming a period piece inAmerica persuaded him to switch the story to the present day and look for acheaper location.Up until this point, no Chinese director had ever filmed in the West. Adamantthat he be the first, Bruce began looking at European cities, finally settlingon Rome. Kirk Douglas’s Colosseum battle in Spartacus (1960) gave Bruce the ideafor a final fight between himself and a Western bad guy. More important, Italyfit with his Eastwood strategy of conquering Hollywood.When Clint Eastwood was unable to jump from TV to film, he made several cheapspaghetti westerns in Italy. Bruce believed Hong Kong could be for him whatItaly was for Clint Eastwood—a bank shot back to Hollywood. “I’ll go to HongKong and make it big there,” Bruce confidently told an American friend. “ThenI’ll come back here and be a superstar like Eastwood. You just watch me.” Bruceintended Way of the Dragon to be his spaghetti eastern, the movie that wouldgain him traction in the West.It took Bruce about a month to finish a rough draft. In this modern Europeanupdate of his original The Warrior conceit, a Chinese restaurant in Rome isbeing threatened by the Italian mafia. The owner appeals to his uncle back inHong Kong to send reinforcements. He dispatches his nephew, Tang Lung, whosename means “China Dragon.” (The Chinese name for the film is Powerful DragonCrosses the Sea.) Drawing on his own experiences as a new immigrant to America,Bruce conceived of Tang Lung as a naive country bumpkin from the NewTerritories. “He is a simple man, but he likes to act big,” Bruce told areporter during filming. “He doesn’t really understand a metropolis like Rome,but he pretends that he does.”  Tang Lung is a fish out of water, and as aresult Bruce pioneered a new trend in Hong Kong cinema—the kung fu comedy—whichJackie Chan would later perfect. Tang Lung is looked down upon not only by theWesterners but also by his own more sophisticated city-slicker Chinese cousins.His secret weapon is his mastery of kung fu. “Well it is really a simple plot ofa country boy going to a place where he cannot speak the language but somehow hecomes out on top, because, he honestly and simply expressed himself,” Brucelaughingly told Esquire magazine, “by beating the hell out of everybody who getsin his way.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]While Bruce was working on the script, his old screenwriting mentor StirlingSilliphant arrived at Kai Tak Airport on April 10, 1972. Silliphant wasresearching another movie but also had hopes of reviving the Silent Fluteproject. Bruce had hopes of impressing Stirling with what a huge star he hadbecome. Bruce greeted him at the airport with Raymond Chow, beautiful GoldenHarvest actresses Nora Miao and Maria Yi, and a gaggle of reporters and TV crewsin tow to record how Hollywood was visiting the island kingdom to kiss the newprince’s ring. “Every time there was a newspaper report about some black orwhite guy coming all the way from the States to be in a film with Bruce Lee,”Andre Morgan says. “Wow! That’s a lot of face for the Chinese.”Bruce took Stirling on a stroll through the streets that turned into a parade.“He was followed by hundreds of people,” Stirling recalls. “They were justflocking, yelling, trying to get next to him. Bruce was wearing a fantasticthree-piece white Brioni suit and walking like a king, smiling at people. It wasbeautiful. God, it was beautiful.” Bruce wanted Stirling to see Fist of Fury inthe theaters with a Chinese crowd. “You couldn’t believe the way the peoplewatched that film,” Stirling says. “They were silent and then they yelled. Andwhen he was kicking the Japanese around they loved it.”After returning to the States, Silliphant wrote Bruce a letter dated April 20,1972, discussing The Silent Flute. At this point it seems that Stirling andBruce were both interested in reviving the project. “I can’t begin to tell youhow gratifying it is to see your phenomenal success. I truly hope that I’ll beable to get back to Hong Kong later this year and that we can put THE SILENTFLUTE before the cameras. Believe me I’ll be working on it.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]While Bruce and Raymond Chow were coequal partners in Concord, it was asatellite company of Golden Harvest. In effect Chow was still Bruce’s boss. Asan employee, Bruce’s only leverage was to threaten to quit. When Bruce tried toconvince Raymond to let him direct his own movie instead of working with Lo Weion Yellow Faced Tiger, he feinted toward Run Run Shaw. They had a meeting thatwas leaked to the press, which reported that Shaw Bros. was offering Bruce alucrative deal. The ensuing furor forced Run Run Shaw’s press secretary to issuea vague denial: “I don’t disregard the possibility that we may sign Lee, he’scertainly commercial, but if Shaw Bros. does sign Lee, it would not be thisyear.” Fearing he might lose his biggest moneymaker, Raymond caved and allowedthe untested Bruce to direct his first film. From this point on, whenever Brucehad a major conflict with Chow, he would meet with Shaw.Bruce began auditioning dozens of actresses and pop stars for the femalecostarring role. Interestingly, one actress who never got a chance was BettyTing Pei. Bruce blamed the decision on his boss.“Ah, um, everything is already fixed,” Bruce tried to explain. “Raymond wasn’tso keen on you playing the part.”“It doesn’t matter,” Betty said. “As long as we are together.”“I like your new hair cut. It looks good shorter,” Bruce said, changing thesubject. “Where do you get it styled? I want a new look for Way of the Dragon.”“Anthony Walker did it,” Betty said. “I’ll set up an appointment before you goto Rome.”The actress Bruce finally settled on was Nora Miao, his costar from Fist ofFury. His decision was driven primarily by a desire to undermine Lo Wei. Raymondhad assigned Nora to costar with Jimmy Wang Yu in Yellow Faced Tiger, the movieBruce had turned down. This would have made Yellow Faced Tiger essentially asequel to Fist of Fury with the same team, except for Jimmy instead of Bruce inthe lead. Bruce insisted that Raymond pull Nora from Lo Wei’s project and giveher to him. Raymond sided with his star actor over his star director.When Lo Wei found out, he was fit to be tied. “Lo Wei was very angry, even withme,” Nora says. “He thought I went to Rome because Bruce was famous. I said thatwas not true, I only did what the company told me to. I did not even understandwhy they sent me.” As recompense for the loss of Nora, Lo Wei demanded that Chowgive him one of the character actors Bruce wanted, Lee Kwan. When the LittleDragon found out that Raymond had acceded to Lo Wei’s demands, it was his turnto blow hot. “Bruce was swearing in Cantonese and English. It was shocking, theworst street language,” says Chaplin Chang, who served as a production manageron Way of the Dragon. “He vowed that one day he would run his own studio.”Still furious about Nora, Lo Wei lashed out in the press. He told the Singaporenewspaper New Nation that Jimmy Wang Yu, not Bruce Lee, was the number one starof Hong Kong cinema. Bruce responded that his success had nothing to do with LoWei’s direction and he would prove it with Way of the Dragon.Image [../images/sec.jpg]After a nineteen-hour TWA flight, Bruce, Raymond, production manager ChaplinChang, and cinematographer Tadashi Nishimoto landed in Aeroporto Leonardo daVinci on May 5, 1972. They checked into the Hotel Flora at Via Veneto for theremainder of their stay until May 17.The four men had several days free before Nora Miao and the rest of the HongKong film crew arrived. They decided to do some sightseeing and shopping. Thegroup went to Pisa to see the Leaning Tower. “On the way we stopped at a ‘Gucci’boutique,” recalls Chaplin. “Bruce and Raymond found themselves enthralled atthe high-class fashion on display and bought many items of clothing. I rememberBruce buying a very high quality Italian leather jacket, and remember thinkinghow soft the leather was.”The group quickly grew tired of Italian food, and the shabby Chinese restaurantsin Rome didn’t do their native cuisine any justice. Nishimoto happened upon aJapanese restaurant, The Tokyo, which wasn’t half bad. It quickly became theirfavorite place to eat and drink sake. “One day in the restaurant after drinkingthree small cups of sake, a waiter handed Bruce a towel to wipe his face,”remembers Nishimoto. “Realizing he had wiped away his contact lenses byaccident, out came his sunglasses and he happily talked on.” Sake turned out tobe the only type of liquor Bruce could consume in quantity, and it became hisfavorite beverage as the pressures of fame grew heavier.When Raymond and Chaplin Chang met with the Italian film company providingsupport for the Chinese crew, one of Raymond’s first questions was how much perdiem, or daily allowance, he should pay his people in Rome. “The lady said it isnormally about 70,000 or 80,000 lira per day,” Chaplin says. “But she added thatsince we were all men and we might want to enjoy girls, 100,000 lira would bebetter. So Raymond agreed to 100,000.”This moment, or perhaps the ensuing research into the subject, seems to haveinspired the prostitute scene in Way of the Dragon. Having been scolded for nottrying hard enough to fit in and be friendly, Bruce’s naive bumpkin character,Tang Lung, inadvertently lets himself get picked up by an Italian hooker in thePiazza Navona. It is not until she walks out of the bathroom of the hotel roomnaked that he realizes his mistake and flees in terror—a scene that causedknowing Hong Kong audiences aware of Bruce’s reputation to chuckle.For the part of the prostitute, Bruce selected Malisa Longo after seeing herphoto in a magazine. “Honestly, I had doubts about working on that film, becausethe role which was offered to me was too small,” Malisa Longo says. “In ItalyBruce was a nobody and totally unknown.” She initially thought Bruce wasconceited until “he gave me a smile, which kinda broke the ice.” When they wereshooting the nude hotel scene, “Bruce was very nervous and electric, as you cansee in every frame of the scene,” Longo says. “With me Bruce was very gentle andsweet. Even when he was with many other people he was always seeking my eyes. Iknow I liked him very much.”One person who may not have appreciated their mutual fondness was Nora Miao.“She was very reserved,” says Longo. “After she finished work on the set shealways disappeared.” Nora had arrived with the second crew several days earlier.As the only girl she had developed a playful dynamic with the boys. “We hadnothing to do after dinner. We thought, ‘Let’s have some fun,’ ” Nora remembers.“They asked me to stand in the street to see if someone would pick me up,because we knew that young men in Rome liked to make passes. They said, ‘Juststand there.’ I was up for some fun. Before long a sports car drove past, andthen reversed back. As the car pulled over and the window turned down, I fled towhere they waited for me. We played jokes like this, and we really had a lot offun making the film with Bruce.”According to Nora, these games of pretend extended to her relationship withBruce. An Italian producer kept winking at her during filming. “Why does he dothat all the time?” she asked Bruce. “It is really disgusting.”“No problem,” Bruce said. From then on, Bruce sat next to Nora during mealtimes. He would hold her hand, get her food, and be really nice to her. Whenthey walked, he would put his arm around her shoulder. The producer stoppedwinking and making clucking sounds. “He thought I was Bruce’s girlfriend,” Norasays. “He dared not wink anymore.”Her story does explain the dozens of photos of Bruce and Nora canoodling inRome. But when two beautiful young costars making a movie in an exotic foreigncity playact at being lovers, the line the between pretense and reality canvanish quickly. Certainly everyone else involved in the production believed theycrossed it. “One morning we all came down for breakfast,” Chaplin Chang recalls.“We were there, then Bruce, and then Nora came down. The waiter stared at Bruce.They looked like they had done something very intimate.” Andre Morgan says, “Itwas a fling. What happens on a film location is no big deal.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]Paying homage to the visual style of Sergio Leone’s spaghetti westerns, Bruceplanned a dramatic introduction for the bad guy, Colt, as he steps off the planeat Rome’s airport. He had asked Chuck Norris to play the role. “I was aware thatan appearance in a movie—even one made in Hong Kong—could get me heightenedvisibility, which might draw more students to our [karate] schools,” Norrissays. “I had no thought that it might be the start of a new career for me.”Chuck brought with him not only his résumé as America’s top karate champion, butalso a surprise stowaway—his assistant instructor and business partner, BobWall. “Chuck gets off the phone with Bruce and says he’s going to Rome to be ina movie,” Wall remembers. “You’re not fucking going alone. We’re partners. So Ipaid my own way.” Wall claims that Bruce was “thrilled” to see him, because “heloved me.” According to Chaplin Chang, Bruce was less than pleased and had a fewchoice words about his uninvited guest. “Bob’s arrival caused a bit ofunhappiness. When we were back at the hotel, Bruce said, ‘Why did Norris bringthis guy?’ ” Chaplin recalls. “Given the way he talked about Bob, it was clearBruce didn’t like him.” In the end, Chuck convinced Bruce to give Bob a role.Because it was illegal to film in the Colosseum, the Chinese crew had to bribethe right officials and pretend to be tourists, carting in their cameras inbags. The guards only allowed the guerrilla filmmakers a few hours to film a fewexteriors and establishing shots: Chuck looking down at Bruce, Bruce runningaround, Chuck and Bruce meeting face-to-face. Mostly the cinematographerNishimoto took still photos with a Hasselblad camera that gave the Chineseproduction team back in Hong Kong the right perspective to create the columnsand backdrops to re-create the Colosseum at Golden Harvest’s studios. It was inHong Kong that the bulk of the fight scene was choreographed and shot over anintensive three-day period.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Having captured as much of Rome as they possibly could in twelve days, Bruce,his Chinese team, Chuck Norris, and Bob Wall arrived at the Kai Tak Airport at 3p.m. on May 18, 1972. Linda and Shannon were there to greet Bruce along with agroup of reporters. At the press conference, Bruce was as glib and charming asever. Rumors had swirled that the inexperienced filmmaker was running overbudget. When asked how much money he had already spent on the film, Brucedodged, “I have not estimated the expenditure and never worry about it. Ibelieve if it is worthwhile to spend the money, then I spend it. Otherwise Iwould not waste the money, as the first priority is to think what is reasonablyneeded, and then the profit will follow.”“How much profit will your next movie make at the box office?” asked anotherreporter. Just as Muhammad Ali liked to hype his fights by predicting whichround he would knock out his opponents, Bruce enjoyed boasting of how much moneyhis movies would make. In response to the question, Bruce immediately raisedfive fingers, meaning HK$5 million.Another reporter followed up: “In The Big Boss you used the famous ‘three kicks’and it took HK$3,000,000 at the box office, then there was the nunchaku you usedin Fist of Fury and that achieved the HK$4,000,000 mark, so I ask you, whatweapon will you employ in your latest movie to reach your prediction ofHK$5,000,000?”“Mark my words, you will find out soon enough,” Bruce teased. (He planned to usetwo nunchakus at the same time.)Seeing the slight-of-frame star sitting next to the larger Westerners, areporter asked, “Do you and Mr. Norris have a fight scene in the movie?”“Will Chuck Norris and I fight in the movie?” Bruce smiled. “Did you think wewould make love?”Almost everyone burst out laughing, but a few reporters were offended. Referringto this joke, Kam Yeh Po at Starry Night News criticized Bruce as “arrogant” and“spoiled by his sudden stardom.” His editorial marked the beginning of the endof Bruce’s honeymoon period with the Hong Kong media. Fawning press coveragebegan to give way to more critical assessments.Since The Big Boss, Bruce had been challenged by dozens of attention-seekingkung fu dilettantes in the press. Chuck Norris’s arrival in Hong Kong stirred apatriotic wave of challenges to the American. Unused to being publicly calledout, Norris was upset, but Bruce told him to forget about it. “It’s a no-winsituation,” Bruce counseled. “All these guys want is publicity.” But Bob Wall, ahot-tempered Irishman, was having none of it. He gave a statement to the pressaccepting any challenge on Chuck’s behalf and proposing they hold it on the latenight talk show, Enjoy Yourself Tonight. “My instructor, Chuck Norris, has beenchallenged. Now Chuck is a much better fighter than I am, so I want you, whoeveryou are, to fight me first to see if you qualify to face him. Our fight will beheld on TV so everyone in Hong Kong can see it, because I’m going to beat you todeath.”Unsurprisingly, there were no challengers waiting for them when Bruce, Chuck,and Bob showed up at the studio of Enjoy Yourself Tonight on May 19, 1972. Soinstead of a live death match, the crowd was treated to Chuck Norrisdemonstrating his karate on Bob Wall. Then Bruce jumped up to show off a fewlightning-fast kicks while Chuck held a focus mitt for him.Afterward, they sat down on the couch for the interview portion. The host,Josiah Lau, asked Bruce in Cantonese, “Is it true what is said in the newspapersthat these Westerners are also your students in the States, and although youinstruct them, they have won many karate championships? I think your kung fumust be very powerful.”With a grin, Bruce waved his hands and avoided the bait. “Now, don’t play gameswith me, I have never told anyone they are my students. We are good friends andwhen we have time we get together and discuss martial arts.”Switching to English, Josiah Lau posed the question to Chuck Norris. “Manypeople said that you two were Bruce’s students, but Bruce has denied this, hesaid that you were just friends. So which is true?”Chuck Norris gave an answer so perfect he must have known about the questionbeforehand and crafted his response with utmost care. “The fact is we are toobad to be his students, and he is too good to be our teacher.” Chuck smiled, asthe crowd burst into laughter and appreciative applause at his face-giving,Chinese-like humility. “Nevertheless, we admire his kung fu and even though hedoesn’t treat us as students, we still take him as our teacher.”“What do you think of Bruce Lee?” Josiah Lau asked.“He is a lovely man, a well-educated man,” Norris said, “and, in addition, ofall the martial artists I have met, he is the best.”It is no wonder that of all the martial artists Bruce had met he loved ChuckNorris the most.Image [../images/sec.jpg]This period of Bruce’s life was arguably his happiest and certainly his mostprofessionally satisfying. He was completely in charge of his own movie—not anactor for hire—and by all accounts he was very good at it: firm, fair, and fun.“I remember someone saying that Bruce couldn’t sit still, and I agree, he was anon-stop engine,” says Chi Yao Chang, the assistant director. “You would alwayssee him moving, directing, demonstrating. Even though he could have taken abreak at any time, he chose to busy himself in showing his colleagues how tofight and would often tell dirty jokes which enlivened the sometimes tenseatmosphere of the movie set.” One moment Bruce would put a Coca-Cola can on topof a light fixture and practice kicking it off to prepare for his scene where hejump kicks an overhead light; the next moment he would ask Anders Nelsson, whowas in the film, to pull out his guitar and play his favorite song,“Guantanamera,” as he sang and danced along. “In one day I played that songseventeen times,” says Nelsson. “I really hate that song now.”Like any good gang leader, Bruce rewarded loyalty and shared his success withhis crew. He gave three of his childhood friends—Robert Chan, Unicorn Chan, andhis manservant, Wu Ngan—roles as waiters in the restaurant. “He made sure I wastreated with respect along with all the other men who worked side by side withhim,” says Wu Ngan. Because Unicorn Chan was struggling in the movie business,Bruce credited him as “assistant fight choreographer” to help boost his career.With Chuck Norris and his childhood friends surrounding him, he had merged histwo worlds—America and China. Everything he had worked so hard to achieve wascoming together for him. “Bruce was a very fun guy, always laughing and having agood time, and he liked to show off on set,” says Jon T. Benn, who played themafia boss. “There were some pretty girls on the set and he liked to flirt, andwhen we were ready to shoot he was a perfectionist.”One of the pretty girls hanging around the set was Betty Ting Pei. Whatever hisrelationship with Nora Miao was in Italy—pretend or an on-location fling—itended upon their return to Hong Kong. Bruce continued his affair with Betty. “Iwas with him all the time at the studio,” Betty says. “Everybody there knew Iwas his girlfriend.”  Their relationship was becoming serious enough that Brucewas far less discreet than usual. He would take her on dates out in public. “Iran into them a couple of times at the Chin Chin Bar,” says Anders Nelsson.“Bruce was engrossed with Betty. You could see there was magic. They were likethe couple that can’t stand to be apart—touchy-feely, gazing into the eyes.”Andre Morgan concurs, “Bruce was quite taken with Betty. She was very glamorousin her own right.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]When Bruce first called up Chuck Norris to be in his film, Chuck jokingly asked,“Who gets to win?”“I’m the star,” Bruce laughed. “But I promise you the fight will be thehighlight of the film.”“Okay, but only this one time,” Norris joked. “How do you want me to prepare?”“What do you weigh?” Bruce asked.“162 or 163.”“I’m almost 140,” Bruce said. “I want you to gain twenty pounds.”“There’s only three weeks before filming!” Norris protested. “Why?”“It will make you look more formidable as an opponent.”While there may have been some truth in his explanation, it couldn’t have beenlost on Bruce, who had spent his life working in film, that twenty pounds ofextra fat would soften Chuck’s muscular definition in sharp contrast to Bruce’sripped physique. “One of the reasons Chuck doesn’t like to talk about Way of theDragon is because he thinks he looks like a fat moose,” says Bob Wall.Additional weight would also slow down Norris’s movements in comparison to thealready lightning-quick Lee. As the star, director, and producer, Bruce wasn’tabove stacking the deck in his favor.Bruce’s thirteen pages of detailed notes and stick figure drawings for theColosseum fight were partially inspired by the second and third rounds ofMuhammad Ali’s boxing match against Cleveland Williams (1966). “Bruce would playthe Williams fight over and over on the little eight-millimeter movie projectorhe had,” says Joe Lewis, one of Bruce’s karate champion students. “He wouldstudy the way Ali punched, the way he moved. Bruce emphasized mobility. Karatepeople were using stationary stances.” From this foundation, he worked withChuck to add kicks, throws, and other martial art techniques over three longdays of shooting at Golden Harvest’s Colosseum set. All the while, Bruceinstructed Chuck on the differences between fighting in the ring versus fightingon film—sport versus entertainment martial arts. “We got a good lesson fromBruce,” Bob Wall remembers. “When you fight for real, you don’t let somebodyknow they’ve hurt you. But because it is a staged fight scene somebody’s notgoing to hurt you, but you have to convince the audience that they did. So it’sa reverse.”Bruce had promised Chuck their scene would be the highlight of the film, and hewas correct. Whatever one thinks of Way of the Dragon, and opinions vary wildly,the overwhelming consensus is their battle is one of the best fight scenes everput on film. In retrospect, much of its allure is that it pits the two mostfamous martial artists of their generation against each other. But the reasonfor its enduring appeal runs deeper. Unlike Jackie Chan and Jet Li, who grew upas entertainers, Bruce was a martial arts instructor and innovator for manyyears. He approached the scene like a teacher with a pedagogical purpose. At thebeginning he is losing to Norris because he is stuck in the classical style. Onthe verge of defeat, he adapts to his circumstances and begins to freely expresshimself—shuffling, bobbing and weaving, and turning the tide of the fight. Theentire scene is a Jeet Kune Do tutorial. He wasn’t just filming a fight scene;he was making a philosophical argument about how martial arts should be taughtand practiced.Along with merging the physical and the mental into the scene, Bruce was alsoable to invest it with unusual emotions for a kung fu flick. There is a playfulsense of humor when they wag their fingers at each other and when Bruce rips ahandful of hair from Chuck’s burly chest and then has trouble wiping it from hishands. Whereas most kung fu fight scenes were driven by revenge and mutual hate,the two warriors, who were old friends in real life, faced each other withmutual respect. At the end when Chuck’s arm and knee are broken, Bruce’s eyesplead with him to quit. When Chuck refuses, Bruce’s face reflects remorse athaving to kill him. Afterward Bruce covers Chuck’s dead body with his uniformand kneels in a gesture of respect and grief.Image [../images/sec.jpg]When Norris left Hong Kong on June 13, one third of the film was stillincomplete. Already behind schedule and over budget, Bruce was going to miss theoriginal summer release date. He didn’t complete principal photography untilJuly 23, when postproduction could finally begin.Most Hong Kong movies used canned music to keep costs down. Bruce insisted onhiring musicians to create an original score and personally sat in for onesession and played a percussion instrument. The movie had been shot on 35mm withno sound. The voices were all dubbed later in various languages—Cantonese,Mandarin, English. Bruce asked to dub his own voice for the English version.“This had never happened where a movie star wanted to do this,” says Ted Thomas,a British disc jockey and voice actor. “He couldn’t do it. Not surprising,because it’s not an easy technique. The other voice actors got pissed off,because they were being held up and Bruce didn’t mean much to them. Bruce asked,‘Aren’t you going to let me do it?’ I said, ‘No, no, we have guys who do itprofessionally.’ So he got pissed off about that.”  To appease the star anddirector, Thomas let Bruce dub the voice of the African American henchman whothreatens the Chinese waiters in the restaurant.With his movie too late for the summer blockbuster season and 40 percent overbudget, Raymond Chow convinced Bruce to film a Winston cigarette advertisementto recoup some of the cost overruns and promote the movie for its release in thedead zone of winter. The plan was for Bruce to film a three-minute martial artsdemonstration, and have it paired with a three-minute weightliftingdemonstration by Bolo Yeung. It was 1972—cigarettes were still consideredhealthy, even for athletes.Bruce called up Bolo. “He said he was planning on doing a Winston cigarettecommercial,” Bolo says. “The next day I went to Golden Harvest to film thecommercial.” Bruce never smoked cigarettes—marijuana yes, tobacco no—believing,correctly, that they were bad for a fighter’s lungs. After reconsidering thematter, Bruce decided against filming an original martial arts demonstration forthe commercial. As a compromise he agreed to let edited clips from Way of theDragon be used in the Winston ads. The tagline: “When you talk about fighting,you’re talking about Bruce. When you talk about flavor, you can’t beat Winston.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]Bruce had bet everything—his finances, his reputation, and his new company—thathis directorial debut would be a hit. He had broken with Lo Wei, racked up animmense debt with Raymond, and bragged to the press that his movie would makeHK$5 million. “The money we were spending was being advanced to us on thestrength of profits that were not yet realized,” Linda says. “That made itdoubly important Way of the Dragon was successful.” Despite all this, he avoidedmany of the promotional appearances he had happily done for The Big Boss andFist of Fury, because the press had begun printing negative articles about him.Feeling snubbed, the media criticized him even more as Way of the Dragon’srelease date—December 30, 1972—approached.In the end, it didn’t matter that Bruce scaled back his promotional activities.It didn’t matter that the movie wasn’t released in the summer blockbusterseason. All that mattered was Bruce Lee starred in the movie. His fans came outin droves. In its opening weekend alone, it sold over HK$1 million in tickets.By January 13, 1973, it had broken Fist of Fury’s record and went on to fulfillhis prediction, reaching HK$5,307,000.This was not the comparison Bruce cared about most. He wanted to see how hismovie did against the project he had turned down. One month after Way of theDragon, Lo Wei and Jimmy Wang Yu released their movie. It barely made HK$2million at the box office. The victory made it clear that Lee Little Dragon hadeclipsed Jimmy Wang Yu as the undisputed box office champion of East Asia.“The reaction to Way of the Dragon was better than we expected. We were a littlebit worried,” says Louis Sit, the studio manager at Golden Harvest. “The peopleliked it because Bruce Lee was a Chinese hero fighting all the foreigners. Atthat time, Hong Kong was starting to develop into an international city, so thatin all walks of life, like manufacturing and finance, they wanted to challengeforeigners. Why can’t we be better than them? Bruce may have been fightingforeigners physically but at that time all of Hong Kong and Asia was fightingforeigners in all types of businesses. It was a feeling that everyone shared.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]Despite the commercial success of Way of the Dragon, Bruce was dissatisfied withits overall quality. While he was certain it was infinitely better than Lo Weiand Jimmy Wang Yu’s movie, he feared sophisticated Western moviegoers would findit amateurish. Bruce invited Peter, and his wife, Eunice Lam, to attend aspecial screening. After it was over, Bruce quietly asked his older brother,“How was the film?”“Ah, um, the music was quite good,” Peter said, damning it with faint praise.Bruce pulled back like he’d been struck. Eunice put her hand on his, trying tothink of something kind to say to soften the blow. Bruce’s palms were clammy.She remained silent.Bruce decided Way of the Dragon was not good enough to be his spaghettieastern—his ticket back to Hollywood. He did not want it released to the West.When he discovered that Raymond Chow, without his knowledge, had sold thedistribution rights to North America, he erupted. “There was a big scream out atthe studio when Bruce found out,” says Andre Morgan. “He felt that Raymond Chowhad betrayed him.”Bruce was self-critical enough to realize he had much room for improvement as afilmmaker. He intended to make the ultimate martial arts movie in his nextattempt.The Big Boss, Fist of Fury, and Way of the Dragon were commercial,revenge-driven genre flicks. For his next film, he wanted to focus on hisphilosophy—a martial way rather than a martial art movie. He had tried this oncewith The Silent Flute in Hollywood. Still bitter about its failure, he rewrotethe script specifically for a Chinese audience. He removed Silliphant’s Freudiansymbolism and focused on cultural references Asian audiences would understand.He entitled his Sinicized version Northern Leg Southern Fist. In China, northernstyles of kung fu are famed for their kicking techniques and southern for theirstriking. A master of both would be the complete Chinese martial artist.In an eighty-page Butterfly Steno Notebook, Bruce handwrote the story treatmentfor Northern Leg Southern Fist, including some dialogue, camera angles, anddrawings. Following closely the plot structure of The Silent Flute, thetreatment opens with a challenge match between the hero and his kung fuclassmates versus students from a rival style. The hero and his buddies losebadly, because they have been taught the “classical mess.”  The distraughthero—painfully realizing, just as Bruce had with Wing Chun, that his “fightingstyle is artificial and restraining”—sets off to find the Bible of Martial Artsto become a true master. On his Holy Grail quest, he is accompanied by the themesong, “What Is the Truth of Martial Arts?,” and a lovestruck girl, referred toas “Our Girl Friday,” whom he ignores, naively believing his quest is tooimportant for romantic distractions. He quickly takes up with a master ofSouthern Fist to train during the day and a Northern Leg master to train atnight. In a restaurant braggarts insult the hero’s teachers. He challenges themto a fight, using first his southern striking style and then his northernkicking style. He is holding his own but not winning. It is not until amysterious Old Man sitting at a nearby table suggests “Use hands and feet” thatour hero combines the two and is victorious. Afterward he chases down the OldMan and crows, “I have created a style of my own!”If this were a patriotic Chinese kung fu movie, it might have ended here. Thehero would have symbolically unified the north and south—historically thedividing line in China. But Bruce had a new truth he wanted to deliver, a sermonhe wanted to preach. The Old Man serves as a mouthpiece for Bruce’s Jeet Kune Dophilosophy. “Styles separate people rather than unite them,” the Old Man scoffs,as flute music plays in the background. When the hero begs the Old Man toinstruct him, he waves him off: “I am not a teacher. I am a signpost for atraveler who is lost. It is up to you to decide the direction.”Flashing forward in time, the hero arrives on the island where the Bible ofMartial Arts is kept by a famous monk. Like in The Silent Flute, the hero has tocompete against other martial artists and pass several tests to become the newKeeper of the Bible of Martial Arts. Fortunately for him, he has mastered theOld Man’s Jeet Kune Do philosophy and easily defeats his Southern Fist andNorthern Leg teachers. He is offered the Bible and the job of Keeper. In TheSilent Flute, the hero rejects the book outright and never looks inside, but inBruce’s recycled version he examines it. “Slowly the hero takes the book and heopens it page by page, which is all blank, and that’s when he turns to the lastpage with the mirror set on it and sees himself.” After learning the secret, thehero rejects the job offer: “A live person is more appealing than this book.” Ashe heads back, he grabs “Our Girl Friday” and kisses her. The other failedapplicants plead, “What is the secret of the book?”  The hero refuses to answer,instead ending the movie with this wan quip, “I can tell you one thing. Pay moreattention to your girlfriend.”Of Bruce’s oeuvre, Northern Leg Southern Fist was the most personal andautobiographical—the purest distillation of everything he had experienced,learned, and believed—down to the mirror. “He always had this idea if he wasever to open another school. When you walked through the door, there would bethese large red curtains and then a sign that said, ‘Behind These Curtains LiesThe Secret,’ ” says Bob Baker, who costarred in Fist of Fury. “And then when youopened the curtains there was just a full length mirror. And that would be theway you get into the school.”It was heady stuff for a kung fu movie and very much of its era, but it was notcommercial. According to Andre Morgan, Bruce frequently discussed his NorthernLeg Southern Fist treatment with Raymond Chow. Hollywood studio mogul SamuelGoldwyn liked to say about preachy movie ideas, “If you have a message, send atelegram.” Chow was a little more diplomatic. “Raymond’s reaction was that itwas a little too intellectual for Chinese audiences’ taste,” recalls Morgan,“and needed to wait for Bruce to become a more established star.”Chow’s arguments convinced Bruce that Northern Leg Southern Fist was a step toofar for Chinese audiences at this point in his career. Bruce agreed to shelve itfor a later date. “I’m dissatisfied with the expression of cinematic art in HongKong. I believe I have a role. The audience needs to be educated and the one toeducate them has to be somebody who is responsible,” Bruce told the Hong KongStandard. “We are dealing with the masses and we have to create something thatwill get through to them. We have to educate them step by step. We can’t do itovernight. That’s what I’m doing right now. Whether I succeed or not remains tobe seen. But I just don’t feel committed, I am committed.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]With Northern Leg Southern Fist on hold, Bruce was left scratching for a way toeducate the Chinese audience about his philosophy. In the back of his mind hehad a vague idea for a movie. The most successful part of Way of the Dragon washis fight scene with Chuck Norris where his Jeet Kune Do philosophy ofadaptation was embedded within the fight scene itself. “I hope to makemulti-level films in Hong Kong,” Bruce told the press, “the kind of movies whereyou can just watch the surface story if you like, or you can look deeper intoit.” If the fight scene with Chuck was his crowning achievement so far, why notmultiply it?Bruce’s initial notion for his next project, entitled Game of Death, was that agroup of five elite martial artists are hired to retrieve a stolen Chinesenational treasure from the top floor of a five-story wooden pagoda in SouthKorea. The catch: each level is guarded by an expert martial artist of adifferent style who they must defeat to move up a level. (If the idea seemshackneyed that is because the conceit has since been ripped off by countlessaction flicks and video games.) At each level, one of Bruce’s compatriots wouldfirst attempt to defeat the guard and end up dead because he could not liberatehimself from the classical mess. Then Bruce would step in, adapt to the guard’sstyle, and beat him.To underline his philosophical theme, Bruce already had the first image of thefilm in mind. “What I want to show is the necessity to adapt one’s self tochanging circumstances. The inability to adapt brings destruction,” he explainedto a Singaporean reporter for New Nation. “As the film opens, the audience seesa wide expanse of snow. Then the camera closes in on a clump of trees while thesound of a strong gale fills the screen. There is a huge tree in the center ofthe screen, and it is all covered with thick snow. Suddenly there is a loudsnap, and a huge branch of the tree falls to the ground. It cannot yield to theforce of the snow so it breaks. Then the camera moves to a willow tree, which isbending with the wind. Because it adapts itself to the environment, the willowsurvives. It is the sort of symbolism, which I think Chinese action films shouldseek to have. In this way I hope to broaden the scope of action films.”Bruce had the opening image, the theme, and the third-act action sequence. Whathe did not have was a story. Plenty of Hong Kong kung fu movies of that era wereput into production with less. The Big Boss’s script was only three pages long,but it was, unlike Game of Death, revenge-driven—a red-blooded motivation withwhich mass audiences could viscerally relate. Game of Death was an allegoricalquest movie for an unknown item—a kung fu Pilgrim’s Progress.His bosses had not intended to hire a missionary. They wanted to make money, nota statement. Raymond Chow’s reaction to funding Bruce’s didactic project was, toput it politely, “cautious optimism.” Bruce must have sensed the caution morethan the optimism, because he reacted the way he always did when Chow resistedhis plans: he ran to Run Run Shaw. He didn’t just have a meeting this time.Instead he publicly went to Shaw Bros. for a wardrobe test in full costume,makeup, and hair as an ancient Chinese warrior.When the photos of Bruce in costume were deliberately leaked to the press, itappeared that he was not only going to leave Golden Harvest for Shaw but he wasalso planning to film his first period picture for them. Newspapers gleefullyreported that Run Run had offered Bruce a staggering fee for the movie and whenBruce brushed it aside sent him a signed open contract with a request that Brucefill in his own figures. When The China Mail asked Bruce if he would make hisnext movie with Shaw Brothers, he replied, sounding more like a mercenary than amissionary, “It can be produced by Shaws, Golden Harvest, or any film company.It has never been my intention to be tied to a particular company.”Raymond Chow believed Bruce was only using Shaw to improve his negotiatingposition with Golden Harvest, but with so much money in the pot he didn’t wantto call Bruce’s bluff. “When an actor becomes very popular,” Raymond says, “youcannot really throw the book at him the way you want.” Bruce’s feint to Shawsecured the green light from Chow for Game of Death.Rather than fleshing out the script, Bruce immediately began filming the pagodasequence because former student Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had a brief window ofavailability in late August 1972. Abdul-Jabbar, who had already won an NBAchampionship and MVP award in his first three years with the Milwaukee Bucks,had a few free weeks before the next season started. Bruce was delighted—he hadwanted to make a movie with Kareem since they had trained together in LosAngeles. “With me fighting a guy over seven feet tall, the Chinese fans wouldeat it up,” he had predicted.What happens when a five-foot-seven guy fights a seven-foot-two guy, even ifthat shorter guy is Bruce Lee? “I was trying to get a perfect kick to Kareem’sjaw and I must have kicked at least 300 times that day,” Bruce said. “You knowhow high his chin is, huh? I had to really stretch my legs. Well, I finallypulled a groin muscle.” Bruce was nearly injured again when he fell off the setduring a stunt. “I had to catch him,” Kareem remembers, “and we had a good laughabout that because he ended up in my arms like a baby.” Kareem also witnessedBruce dealing with a challenger: “A stuntman wanted to challenge Bruce while hewas in the middle of a conversation. He put him on his back pretty quickly.People decided not to try that any more.”In Bruce’s scheme for the movie, Kareem was the guardian of the fifth and finalfloor—the Big Boss. As for who was on the other four floors beneath, DanInosanto says that Bruce “kept changing it often” based on who was available.Bruce mailed a China Airlines ticket to Inosanto, who took a leave from histeaching job to play the defender of the third floor. “His movie-making is likehis fighting,” Inosanto says. “He just did it. He didn’t know until the nightbefore exactly what he was going to do. Then he put it together. He made up thestory details as he went along, spontaneously. That’s the way Game of Deathwas.”For the defender of the fourth floor, Bruce hired Korean Hapkido expert Ji HanJae, whom Bruce had first met at a martial arts demonstration in the UnitedStates in 1969. Jae had just started as a martial arts actor for Golden Harvestand was readily available. According to several accounts, Bruce was frustratedworking with the inexperienced Jae, who respectfully says, “Bruce was a goodmovie actor. My level and his level was different, so that’s why there was alittle bit of a gap.”Several names were floated for the guardians of the first two floors, includingTaky Kimura (his Seattle instructor) and Wong Shun Leung (his childhood WingChun teacher). He even tried to talk James Coburn into participating while hewas visiting Hong Kong, but Coburn politely refused.Bruce only filmed the top three floors and a few outdoor scenes before he setthe project to the side. Overall, it came to about ninety minutes of roughfootage, which he edited down to about thirty minutes of finished material.In its original form, Lee and two fellow martial artists—James Tien (his Fist ofFury costar) and Chieh Yuan (a Hong Kong stuntman)—arrive on the third floor andencounter Dan Inosanto playing a Filipino master of escrima dressed intraditional garb. Bruce is wearing what has become his most iconic outfit: askintight canary yellow jumpsuit with a black racing stripe. It was inspired bythe ski jumpsuit Roman Polanski lent Bruce during their ski vacation in Gstaad,Switzerland. Even the costumes were meant to support the movie’s thesis that themartial artist had to be better than the martial tradition. “I’m dressed in atypical Muslim outfit. Everybody is in traditional garb,” Inosanto says. “ButBruce looks like the modern jet set.”As the trio face off against Inosanto, Chieh Yuan attacks first with a largewooden log, but is defeated. Bruce pulls out a whiplike bamboo short staff andquickly disarms Inosanto. “The bamboo sword,” he lectures Chieh, “is very muchmore flexible, more alive.”  Then Bruce engages in a riveting nunchaku duel withInosanto, who in real life had introduced Bruce to the weapon. After Bruce wins,the trio rush to the fourth floor where they encounter Hapkido master Ji HanJae, who soundly whips both James Tien and Chieh Yuan. While Bruce steps forwardto finish the job, his two companions dash up the fifth and final floor wherethey are strangled to death by the towering Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and tossed backdown the staircase like rag dolls. After Bruce defeats Ji Han Jae, he steps overhis dead compatriots and heads upstairs, going eyeball–to–belly button withKareem.Unlike the two exemplars of traditional martial arts—Inosanto (Filipino escrima)and Ji Han Jae (Korean Hapkido)—Kareem is a master of “no style” or Jeet KuneDo, just like Bruce. Symbolically, then, Lee is battling his Jungian shadow, andhe is unable to gain the upper hand until he discovers his shadow’s weakness:Kareem’s damaged eyes are supersensitive to sunlight. Bashing through thetower’s window panels, Bruce blinds Kareem and puts him into a chokehold. Aftersnapping his neck, he exhaustedly climbs to the highest level where hepresumably uncovers the tower’s mysterious item. The camera does not followBruce to the final floor and therefore does not reveal the MacGuffin. What theaudience can see is Bruce staggering back down the staircase, seemingly stunnedby his awesome discovery. Bruce toyed with several ideas for the item—the Bibleof Martial Arts, a mirror—but was unable to resolve what it should be. Heplanned to film the treasure reveal scene after he made the decision.From a fight choreography perspective, the battles on each level are intricate,unique, and compelling. They demonstrate Bruce’s mastery of the craft. He alsoachieves a better tonal balance between light slapstick humor and violent actionthan he did in Way of the Dragon. His two foolish companions serve as comicrelief: it’s Bruce and the Two Stooges. Lee had clearly improved as a filmmaker.As Bruce continued shooting the pagoda scenes for Game of Death from late Augustto mid-October 1972 without a script, he struggled to come up with a completescreenplay. He tried to hire several writers, including famous wuxia novelistand screenwriter Ni Kuang, to help him develop the story elements, but none ofthe writers was available. He was suffering from writer’s block, which was nodoubt exacerbated by the pressures, distractions, and temptations of overnightfame."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f0386-01.jpg]Waiting impatiently to be interviewed, circa 1972. (David Tadman)"},{"pageContent":"TWENTY-ONEFAME AND ITS DISCONTENTSWhen The Big Boss was released on October 3, 1971, Bruce suddenly became themost famous person in Southeast Asia. At first, he felt the thrill of victory.After a lifetime acting in movies, he had finally achieved his dream ofsuperstardom. “In Hong Kong, I’m bigger than the fucking Beatles,” Bruce wouldbrag to his friends back in L.A. In less than a year, however, the pressures andburdens of extreme fame were beginning to wear him down. He couldn’t walk downthe street without being surrounded by a crowd. If he wanted to shop forclothes, the store had to close lest he be besieged. When he went to arestaurant, people would press their faces against the windows to stare at him.“The biggest disadvantage,” Bruce admitted to Black Belt magazine, “is losingyour privacy. It’s ironic but we all strive to become wealthy and famous, butonce you’re there, it’s not all rosy. There’s hardly a place in Hong Kong whereI can go to without being stared at or people asking me for autographs. That’sone reason I spent a lot of time at my house to do my work. Right now, my homeand the office are the most peaceful places. Now I understand why stars likeSteve [McQueen] avoid public places. In the beginning I didn’t mind thepublicity I was getting. But soon, it got to be a headache.”When Alex Ben Block, a reporter for Esquire magazine, asked Bruce if fame hadchanged him, he replied: “Well, it’s changed in the sense that it’s like I’m injail. I’m like a monkey in the zoo. I like to joke a lot, but I cannot speak asfreely as I could before. But it hasn’t changed me basically. It doesn’t make mefeel proud or that I am any better than I was. I’m basically the same [said witha laugh] damn old shit.”Worse than the loss of privacy was the increased sense of danger. It seemed likeeveryone wanted to challenge him to a fight. Once he jumped into a cab, and thedriver turned around and asked, “Do you want to fight? Your kung fu isn’t sogood.” He stopped going out in public alone and hired certain trusted stuntmenas his bodyguards.One afternoon a deranged stalker jumped over the wall of his Kowloon Tongmansion into his garden where Brandon and Shannon were playing. The guy screamedthat he wanted to fight Lee Little Dragon. “How good are you?” he shouted. “Showme how good you are!” Given that two of his friends, Jay Sebring and SharonTate, had recently been killed by the Manson gang, he was both terrified andinfuriated. “This guy was invading my home, my own private home,” Bruce angrilyrecalled. “I kicked him harder than I ever kicked anyone. I gave him my all.”Afterward Bruce made sure his children had minders at all times so they wouldnot be kidnapped. “Bruce was very concerned about his children beingunescorted,” Linda says. “It’s not like America where your kid just goes out thedoor. He was very careful.”The triads were not as involved in the Hong Kong movie business in the early1970s as they would later become in the 1980s and 1990s, because Run Run Shawhad a monopoly over the industry. But there were still some shady charactershiding in the shadows outside the glare of the klieg lights. A few of themvisited Bruce after Fist of Fury became a smash. “I had people stop by my doorand just pass me a check for HK$200,000. When I asked them what it was for, theyreplied, ‘Don’t worry about it, it’s just a gift to you.’ I didn’t even knowthese people, they were strangers to me,” Bruce told Fighting Stars, an Americanmartial arts magazine. “When people just pass out big money—just like that, youdon’t know what to think. I destroyed all those checks, but it was difficult todo because I didn’t know what they were for.”As a sign of his increased wariness, Bruce began wearing a hidden belt buckleknife. More tellingly, Bruce Lee, the world’s most famous evangelist of unarmedcombat, began carrying a gun for protection. “He became very paranoid,” saysJames Coburn, who visited Bruce in Hong Kong. “He had this impenetrable aura,this shield around him for ten, maybe twelve feet. Anybody who came within thatarea was real suspect and they had to watch out.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]As Bruce increasingly closed himself off, one of the only ways to reach him wasthrough his childhood friends. Since they had known him before he was famous, hestill trusted them completely. Aside from Wu Ngan, his manservant, his oldestand dearest friend was Unicorn Chan. They had grown up in the movie businesstogether. Bruce had sent money from America to help Unicorn when he heard hisfamily was in financial trouble. Unicorn had introduced Bruce to Run Run Shawwhen he was struggling in Hollywood. Bruce had given Unicorn a role in Way ofthe Dragon and credited him as assistant fight choreographer to boost his bumpycareer. They were what the Chinese call lao guanxi, old friends who are foreverexchanging favors.Aware of their relationship, an independent movie company, Xinghai Corporation,approached Unicorn and offered him the leading role in his own movie if he couldconvince Bruce to appear in it with him. Bruce refused, having no interest inplaying a bit role in a shoddy flick. But he didn’t want his old friend to losethis chance, so, as a compromise, he agreed to choreograph some of the actionand to personally help promote the film.Bruce duly spent one day on-set directing a fight sequence and another at apress conference to publicize the upcoming release of Fist of Unicorn. What hedidn’t know was that the Xinghai producers had secretly filmed his participationwith hidden cameras. They took this footage and ineptly inserted it into themovie to make it appear as if Bruce had a role and then used his imageextensively in their marketing campaign, even going so far as to claim that Fistof Unicorn was “Directed by Bruce Lee.” When Bruce found out he had been duped,he was enraged and sued the producers. Unicorn Chan denied any knowledge of whathad been done. “Bruce was angry at himself for having fallen into the trap morethan he was angry at Unicorn personally,” says Andre Morgan.Whether Unicorn knew or not, Bruce realized that unscrupulous people would usehis friends to get to him. This made him almost as wary of them as he had becomeof strangers. On August 12, 1972, Bruce wrote to Mito Uyehara: “Well dearfriend—lately ‘friend’ has come to be a scarce word, a sickening game ofwatchfulness toward offered friendship—I miss you and our once simple lunchestogether and our more joyful communications.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]Everywhere he went in public, Bruce found himself plagued by paparazzi.Initially he tried to be patient, but the relationship grew increasinglyantagonistic. Once when he was leaving a television studio he found himselfsurrounded by a melee of paparazzi. Even after he posed for several minutes,they demanded more. “You’ve got thousands of shots,” he said angrily. When hetried to escape the throng, they pushed him back. In the ensuing scuffle, heknocked a camera out of a photographer’s hands. The next day the headlinesblared that Lee mistreated cameramen.Used to glowing puff pieces, Bruce was surprised and wrong-footed when the pressbegan to turn on him. “Lee was often angry at the media,” remembers Robert Chan,a childhood friend and costar in Way of the Dragon. “He said to me many times,‘I can’t work today. Did you see what they reported?’ He would yell and thenwalk out.”Beyond the media slings and arrows universal for all celebrities, Bruce had todeal with the issue particular to crossover performers: racial purity. Bruce’smovie persona was the invincible Chinese hero, defender of his people. In TheBig Boss, he had defended Chinese migrant workers against vicious Thai bosses.In Fist of Fury, he had defended Chinese honor against the insults of theJapanese. And in Way of the Dragon, he defended a Chinese restaurant fromWestern criminals.But how Chinese was Bruce Lee really? The question haunted much of the coverageof him at the time—and still lingers over his legacy. Sure he was raised in HongKong, but he was born in America, went to college in America, spent a dozenyears living in America, and then came back with a blue-eyed wife and twoEurasian children, speaking rusty Cantonese, and spouting a bunch of foreignideas.When a Chinese reporter asked him, “Do you think that an inter-racial marriagewill face unsolvable obstacles?” Bruce answered: “Many people may think that itwill be. But to me, this kind of racial barrier does not exist. If I say Ibelieve that ‘everyone under the sun’ is a member of a universal family, you maythink that I am bluffing and idealistic. But if anyone still believes in racialdifferences, I think he is too backward and narrow. No matter if your color isblack or white, red or blue, I can still make friends with you without anybarrier.”This post-racial sentiment didn’t sit well with many Chinese who were stillstruggling to find their pride as a people after centuries of colonial rule. IfBruce refused to be a “Yellow Power” Chinese nationalist, then some in the presswould do it for him. Chinese newspapers insisted on spelling his last name inthe Chinese way, “Li,” no matter how many times he told them it should bespelled the American way, “Lee.” A Taiwanese newspaper went so far as to publishan article supposedly penned by Bruce Lee himself in which “Bruce” writes, “I amChinese and I have to fulfill my duty as a Chinese. . . . My identity as Chineseis beyond all doubts. . . . That I should become an American-born Chinese wasaccidental. . . . The truth is: I am a yellow-faced Chinese, I cannot possiblybecome an idol for Caucasians. . . . A Chinese is, and always will be, aChinese.”This anxiety about Bruce’s Chinese-ness flared into a full-fledged controversyover, of all things, facial hair. Very few Han Chinese men can grow a fullbeard—even a thin mustache can take weeks to cultivate. To the Chinese, bodyhair is associated with otherness. (A popular Chinese joke goes, “Why areforeigners so hairy? Because when we were human, they were still monkeys.”)Because of his European ancestry, Bruce could grow a thick beard. He had gottenin the habit of not shaving when he was in America where no one thought anythingabout it. But in Hong Kong, a beard made Bruce look like Genghis Khan’s cousin—aMongol villain in a period movie. It reminded his Chinese fans that he was“mixed blood.”When a Hong Kong magazine ran a photo of Bruce seeing off his family at theairport on January 12, 1972, his bearded face shocked the public. Hong Kong’sRadio and Television Daily criticized his appearance as a bad influence on theyoung and a threat to the social order:His flower shirts, multi-colored pants, sports shoes, and sandals, have alreadyinspired many imitators. But who would have expected that this newly-minted,barely-thirty superstar would grow a full beard? In fact, Bruce’s beard isreminiscent of nothing so much as the “hippies” who recently caused such a stirin America; this look is not nearly as handsome as his old one. The contrarianBruce, however, not only didn’t mind, he even jokingly predicted, “Now thenumber of beards in Hong Kong is about to double.” In fact, we need only lookaround to see the effect. Have not many people, especially the young, alreadybegun to imitate his hairstyle, his fashion, and even his gestures? Might it bethat our relatively Westernized society might be about to shift yet further inthe direction of the Stars and Stripes?Image [../images/sec.jpg]Another group threatened by Bruce’s Western ways were his old Wing Chunclassmates. When he created Jeet Kune Do, Bruce broke with his “mother art.” Foryears he kept it a secret from them. It was not until he was about to move backto Hong Kong that he wrote a letter to his Wing Chun instructor, Wong ShunLeung, confessing his heresy. “Since I started to practice realistically in 1966(protectors, gloves, etc.), I feel that I had many prejudices before, and theyare wrong. So I changed the name of the gist of my study to Jeet Kune Do. JeetKune Do is only a name. The most important thing is to avoid having bias in thetraining,” he wrote, before carefully crediting Wong Shun Leung and Ip Man forhis new creation. “I thank you and Master for teaching me the ways of Wing Chunin Hong Kong. Actually, I have to thank you for leading me to walk on apractical road.”Upon his return, Bruce, whom Ip Man had nicknamed “Upstart,” went to hismaster’s school to demonstrate the superiority of Jeet Kune Do. Standing in thesmall room with Ip Man and a dozen or so Wing Chun students, some new to him,some he had known since he was a teen, Bruce asked for a volunteer to spar withhim. After much hemming and hawing and staring at their feet, a junior studentwas cajoled into agreeing. “The guy was so baffled by my moves,” Brucetriumphantly told Mito Uyehara. “I kept moving in and out, letting go kicks andpunches, never gave him a chance to recover balance. I guess he got sofrustrated because every blow I let go would have hit him if I didn’t controlit. JKD is too fast for Wing Chun.”  The next junior student fared even worse.“I kept throwing fakes and he kept biting. Once he got suckered and almost fellon his face. I didn’t even touch him.”After watching two of their kung fu brothers get humiliated, the senior studentsadamantly refused to spar with Bruce. “Those mothers, they chickened out. I surewould have liked to have sparred them,” Bruce complained. “These were the sameguys who gave me a bad time when I first studied Wing Chun. I was a skinny kidof 15 and these guys even then were already assistant instructors to Ip Man.Well, I guess they saw enough and didn’t want to make an ass of themselves.”Wong Shun Leung wasn’t in attendance that day, but he heard the complaints: LeeLittle Dragon made his Wing Chun brothers lose face; he claims his style isbetter than Wing Chun; someone should teach him a lesson.After The Big Boss came out in theaters, Bruce excitedly called Wong Shun Leung,“Have you seen my movie?”“I have not,” replied his old teacher.“I will send you tickets,” Bruce responded immediately. “You have to see it. Mykung fu is at a different level. My fighting is different from what I learnedbefore. I’m so quick very few people can touch me anymore.”“I know nothing about your progress in kung fu,” his teacher responded, coolly.After receiving two tickets from Bruce, Wong finally went to see the movie withhis top student, Wan Kam Leung. Bruce called the day after they went, an excitedand proud student seeking his teacher’s approval. “So Older Brother Leung, didyou watch the movie?”“Yes, I did.”“Now my kung fu skills are really good now, right? My legs are quick, huh?”“Your punches hit the target slowly but pull back quickly,” Wong replied. Thiswas a pointed criticism. A good Wing Chun student’s punches were supposed to hitthe target quickly and pull back slowly. He was saying that Bruce’s punches wereweak.Surprised and a little hurt, Bruce responded defensively, “Well, what you see inthe movies is different from reality.”“Then let’s try it sometime,” Wong said, laying down a challenge.Arrangements were postponed while Bruce worked on his other films. It was notuntil he finished Way of the Dragon nearly a year later that Bruce invited Wongto visit him at his new mansion in Kowloon Tong. The ostensible purpose was todiscuss Game of Death—Bruce wanted to offer Wong a part as one of the fivepagoda defenders—but the real reason was to see if the student had surpassed histeacher.Thirty-seven-year-old Wong Shun Leung arrived with his senior student, Wan KamLeung. After Bruce showed off his mansion, they went to his “kung fu room”filled with sandbags, punching bags, and specially designed equipment, like hiselectric muscle stimulator. Bruce demonstrated his prowess on all the machines.He kicked a tennis ball hanging six feet in the air three times in a row withoutlowering his leg. And then as a final flourish swept his kicking leg, whichstill hadn’t touched the ground, over to a towel hanging on a chair, grabbed itwith his foot, and brought it back to his face to wipe off the sweat.Cockily, he turned to Wong Shun Leung and accepted his challenge from theprevious year: “Okay, let’s see what you have really got. Would you like to makesome movements?”“If it is only for research, it will be fine. If it is a competition, I will notdo it,” Wong replied, establishing the rules for the duel—light sparring wasacceptable, but he would not participate in a no-rules brawl, like the one Brucehad with Wong Jack Man.“Okay,” Bruce accepted.They faced off against each other. Wong Shun Leung was wearing a long-sleevedMontagut shirt. Bruce was in a T-shirt. Bruce turned into a southpaw stance andleaned on his back leg with his front right foot loose and his front right fistat his waist. They stared at each other for a long time. Neither man wanted tohurry or make a mistake. Suddenly Wong dashed forward and delivered a low kickto Bruce’s knee, a classic Wing Chun opening move. Anticipating it, Bruceswitched his stance and punched at Wong’s face. Wong partially blocked it withhis left hand and sent his right at Bruce’s throat, but Bruce’s deflected punchthumped Wong in the chest before Wong’s fist could reach its target. Point toBruce.“You try to hurt my knee? You are smart,” Bruce teased. “Fortunately, I amaccustomed to this trick. OK, let’s try again.”This time Bruce started bouncing on his toes—dancing, shuffling like hischaracter in his movies. He flicked out several rapid right jabs, causing Wongto step backward and block. After dodging several, Wong slipped a jab andpunched with his left hand at Bruce’s chest. Bruce knocked his hand away.Expecting this, Wong pulled back his left hand to block and used his right handto pierce at Bruce’s throat. At the same moment, Bruce turned his outstretchingright fist into an open palm and slapped Wong lightly across the face. Afraction of a second later, Wong’s fingers tapped Bruce in the throat.Bruce jumped back and said, “Leung, actually I hit you first. Do you think so?”“Don’t take it so seriously.” Wong smiled. “Who hit who first is not the mostimportant thing. It is the strength of the strike that matters. You are right.Your hand hit first, but my protecting hand had already dissolved much of yourpower. Truly, if you strike with all your force, I may not be able to stand it,but if the power is greatly reduced, the strike will not be effective. Moreimportantly, my hand grasped your throat. If we had really fought, surely youwould know who would have been hurt worse.”After this close exchange, Bruce stopped using just his hands and beganemploying his superior kicking techniques. The two men continued to lightly sparand heavily banter between exchanges for about five more minutes. When they hadfinished, Bruce invited Wong Shun Leung and his student, Wan Kam Leung, to anearby coffee shop on Prince Edward Road.“Older Brother Leung, your handwork is excellent. If I hadn’t stepped back fastenough, I would have lost to you,” Bruce said, before grinning. “Butfortunately, you are too slow.”“Your kicking technique is remarkable,” Wong shot back. “If only your foot hadbeen able to touch me once.”As the joshing continued, they turned to Wan Kam Leung for his verdict. “You areof a similar level,” he diplomatically replied.More than forty years later, Wan Kam Leung does not need to be so tactful. “If Ireally had to pick a winner, I would say Bruce won,” he declares now with asmile. “To be honest, if Bruce used all his strength to hit my master, there isno way he would not collapse. His legs were really powerful. I don’t think thereis anyone that can endure one of his kicks. Bruce and my master shook handsafter the coffee and Bruce told him he should come visit him again when he wasfree. After we got back to the studio, my master took off his shirt and I had tomassage him with some Chinese herbal ointment. His arms were black-and-blue.Good thing my master wore a long-sleeve shirt so Bruce couldn’t see hisbruises.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]While Bruce and Wong Shun Leung remained friendly after their “exchange oftechniques,” not every Wing Chun student was satisfied that Bruce’s impertinencehad been avenged. When he was on Hong Kong TV to promote Way of the Dragon,Bruce was asked what he thought of traditional kung fu styles. “If a martialartist wants to seek the truth in combat, the dead traditional form cannotconfine him,” he responded. “The training method of Chinese martial artiststoday is like teaching people to swim on dry land.” Many Wing Chun stylistsinterpreted this, quite rightly, as a public slap in the face—and a financialthreat. Martial arts instruction is a tough business with narrow margins. Ifeven a small fraction of students bailed on their traditional masters to studyJeet Kune Do, their schools might be forced to close.The China Star, a Hong Kong tabloid, ran a multipart series supposedly writtenby Ip Chun, the son of Ip Man, about what Bruce was like as a teenage kung fustudent. In the fourth part, Ip Chun wrote that he had seen the young Bruce Leeget knocked down by an opponent during training due to a flaw in his technique.The flaw in the story was Ip Chun never trained with Bruce when they wereteenagers. He didn’t arrive in Hong Kong until 1965, long after Bruce had movedto America.Taking this article as a public insult, Bruce angrily confronted Ip Chun to askif he had really said what had been printed. Ip Chun denied everything, blamingthe reporter who had ghostwritten the article in his name. Bruce tracked downand accosted the reporter.As Hong Kong’s first genuine superstar, Bruce was the bread and butter oftabloids like The China Star. Its owner and editor, Graham Jenkins, a hardbittenAustralian newspaperman of the Rupert Murdoch mold, published a follow-up story,filled with mock outrage, saying that Bruce had threatened the paper’s informantand had forced him to change his story. Now they had managed to make Bruce looklike a punk and a bully. Further enraged, Bruce sued The China Star for libel.“His logic was if you don’t draw the line, it’s just going to go on and on,”says Andre Morgan. But it did go on and on. Having baited the bull, every thrashof his horns was fresh copy. The China Star gleefully wrote about the lawsuit.As the controversy grew, other newspapers began reporting that Bruce haddisrespected his master, Ip Man, and Ip Man was angry at Lee, quoting Wing Chunstudents who were avenging Bruce’s slights. In traditional Confucian culture,children, students, and disciples were supposed to be deferential and devoted totheir parents, teachers, and masters. The Cultural Revolution in mainland China(1966–76) was upending that power relationship with children turning on theirparents, students on their teachers, and disciples on their masters. Itsreverberations were being felt in Hong Kong, terrifying the authorities. Byespousing individual freedom and a rejection of tradition, Bruce had alignedhimself philosophically with the youth revolt. Rumors of a troubled relationshipwith Ip Man became a kind of shorthand for these larger societal rifts.Conservative outlets, who lionized Bruce as a Chinese hero after the patrioticFist of Fury, were now painting him as too Western, too modern, not Chineseenough.Bruce was experiencing a good old-fashioned public relations crisis: the dripdrip drip of negative stories was damaging his brand. Anger and retaliation hadfailed to stem the erosion—if anything it had made it worse—so, as a proponentof adaptability in combat, he switched to his other great character strength,charm. The truth was Bruce respected Ip Man, and Ip Man liked Upstart. Whateverlarger critique he was making in public, Bruce was extremely polite andsolicitous to Ip Man in person. Whatever reservations Ip Man may have felt aboutBruce’s public remarks about traditional kung fu, he was clever enough toappreciate that having the most famous martial arts actor in Asia as one of hisdisciples was a net positive for him. To quash the rumors of a rift, Bruceinvited Ip Man out for yum cha (afternoon tea and dim sum) at a restaurant nearKowloon Park.While they ate, Bruce smiled at Ip Man and asked, “Do you still treat me as yourstudent?”Ip Man quickly replied, “Do you still treat me as your Sifu?”Both men laughed.After they were done, Bruce said, “Sifu, we haven’t gone for a walk together ina long time. How about we take a walk?”  They strolled along the very busyNathan Road so the public could see that their relationship was good.Image [../images/sec.jpg]A natural disaster allowed Bruce to reestablish his image as a defender of theChinese people. On June 18, 1972, a devastating landslide near Po Shan Roadkilled sixty-seven people, seriously injured twenty others, and destroyed twobuildings. Borrowing from American programming, Hong Kong TV ran its first evertwenty-four-hour celebrity charity telethon, Operation Relief. With Bruce frontand center, it raised over HK$7 million. Bruce brought on Brandon to break someboards. He also donated HK$10,000 to the cause. The clear message: Bruce is aproud Chinese father who helps the people in their time of need. His generositygarnered him plaudits from the press.His charm offensive might have squelched the negative coverage if not foranother unfortunate event. On December 2, 1972, Ip Man died, and Bruce Leefailed to attend the funeral. For three thousand years burial rites andceremonies have been central to Chinese culture. Missing your master’s funeralis the equivalent of spitting on his memory. The press lambasted Bruce. A widelycirculated cartoon showed Lee at Ip Man’s shrine saying, “Sorry, Master, I amtoo busy making money to go to your funeral ceremony.”The media had no difficulty finding Wing Chun disciples to criticize him as adisrespectful renegade who cared more about fame than traditional Chinesevalues. One senior student said: “As for why Bruce Lee didn’t show up when hisown Sifu passed away, it’s pretty hard to understand. As the founder of JeetKune Do and a big movie star, perhaps it was just too inconvenient!” Anotheradded, “When someone passes away, the traditional values my country holds deardemand one pay one’s respect.”Even his former teacher, Wong Shun Leung, piled on: “As for the fact that hedidn’t show up for Sifu’s funeral, this was definitely a breach in terms of thedecorum of the martial arts world. People shouldn’t forget their ‘roots.’ Afterall, even if you break off on your own and start a great new martial art of yourown, you’ll never forget the foundations you built with your teachers. As forBruce’s behavior on this occasion, I don’t know if perhaps he was going througha difficult time or felt awkward, but I still think he should have shown up orprovided some expression of sympathies. It is certainly very difficult for aperson not to let fame get to him!”What is quite remarkable about all their criticism is they knew exactly whyBruce didn’t attend the funeral—he didn’t know Ip Man had died. Ip Man was aminor martial arts teacher at the time. His death was only reported in theChinese-language newspapers, which Bruce rarely read. The only way for him tofind out was for his former Wing Chun brothers and sisters to inform him, andthey purposely did not. “You know those sonovabitches, they live right in thecity and never called me!” Bruce fumed in private to friends. “Dammit, theycarried their jealousy too far. I found out about his death three days later.Shit, I feel real bad and disappointed.” Ip Man’s son, Ip Chun, eventuallyadmitted as much: “When my father passed away, I got out the phone book to tryto call Bruce, but someone prevented me from doing so, and I never did.”One almost has to admire the elegance of the Wing Chun students’ revenge. Brucehad made them lose face by forming his own style and publicly criticizingtraditional kung fu. When Ip Man died, they deliberately did not tell him aboutthe funeral, making him lose face with his fans. Bruce could not publicly defendhimself, because to do so would be to admit how fraught his relationship waswith his former Wing Chun brothers.All Bruce could do to mitigate the crisis was to belatedly show his respects. Onthe seventh day after a Chinese funeral, the equivalent of a wake is held at theperson’s home, because it is believed that the spirit of the dead comes back onthat day. It was set for 8 p.m., but Bruce showed up at seven to make sure hewas the first one there. He humbly apologized to Ip Chun and the rest of IpMan’s family for missing the funeral.All of the pressures of fame—the constant harassment, the backstabbing, therifts with old friends, the concerns over his own and his family’s safety—mighthave made Bruce wonder if it was all worth it, except for one bit of amazingnews. The moment he had been relentlessly working toward for the last sevenyears had finally arrived. Warner Bros. called with an offer to make Bruce Leethe star of his very own Hollywood martial arts movie."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f0402-01.jpg]Jackie Chan getting his neck snapped by Bruce Lee in Enter the Dragon, February1973. (Photofest)"},{"pageContent":"TWENTY-TWOBLOOD & STEELDespite Warner’s rejection of the Kelsey film project about the Mandan tribe,producer Fred Weintraub continued to believe that a movie with Bruce Lee hadcommercial potential. After Bruce went to Hong Kong, Weintraub established aproduction company, Sequoia Pictures, with his partner, Paul Heller, on theWarner Bros. lot. Weintraub asked Bruce for examples that would bolster the casefor a Hollywood-backed kung fu movie. When Lee sent him a copy of The Big Boss,Weintraub knew he had a winner. More than Lee’s electric performance, it wasthose box office numbers. Weintraub was convinced he could cover Warner’s costsby preselling the East Asian foreign markets (Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan,Thailand, and Japan) while producing a film of sufficient quality to attract aWestern audience.Weintraub and Heller approached Dick Ma, Warner Bros. head of Far Eastdistribution and the only Asian American senior executive at the studio. Upuntil this point, Hollywood had sold movies to the Chinese market but had neverworked with Hong Kong. Dick Ma, who had been tracking the success of Shaw Bros.and Golden Harvest, lent his support to the radical idea of the first everHollywood–Hong Kong co-production. With Ma’s encouragement, Weintraub and Hellerbanged out a seventeen-page story treatment about three heroes (a white guy, hisblack friend, and a Chinese mercenary) who enter evil Han’s martial artstournament and end his drug-dealing, slave-trading ways.They entitled the project Blood & Steel and pitched it to Warner’s president TedAshley. He was intrigued but cautious. The TV series Kung Fu had been a surprisecritical success for the studio but it was not a ratings champ. Ashley wasn’tcompletely convinced that American audiences were ready for a Chinese hero.Ashley called Lee in July 1972, while Bruce was working on Way of the Dragon, tosound out his interest in the project. After their phone conversation, Brucewrote Ashley a follow-up letter in which he made ayou-need-me-more-than-I-need-you argument:Dear Ted,Presently, H.K. will be my base of operations as my films are enjoying“unbelievable” success, breaking all time records one after another. . . . IfWarner develops something specific for me, I’m sure my special brand of actionwill sock it to them. . . .Financially, I am secure; unheard of offers have been made to me. Ted, I havegone through the interesting experience of being Number One in Mandarin films.Fame and fortune, and I mean by any standards, are mine. . . .The way I look at it, and honestly feel about it, is that this Chinaman willdefinitely invade the States in a big way, one way or another. I am sure, if yougive this matter a fair and serious thought, something will be worked out to ourmutual benefit.Ted Ashley didn’t get to be president of Warner Bros. by rushing blindly intouncharted territory. He agreed to give Weintraub the paltry amount of $250,000for the film. It was pocket change—the budget for The Exorcist, also filmed in1973, was $11 million. Weintraub knew he would need at least $500,000 to filmthe movie, but ever the dealmaker, he agreed, hoping he could convince RaymondChow to pony up another $250,000 in return for a split of the profits. Inmid-October, he flew out to negotiate with Chow.While Weintraub was away, Paul Heller hired novice screenwriter Michael Allin toturn the treatment into a screenplay. According to Heller, the inspiration forthe script came from a favorite comic strip of his youth, Terry and the Pirates:“It was about China and the Orient and the mystery and dragon ladies.” Accordingto Allin, who knew nothing about kung fu or Hong Kong, the inspiration was alittle more obvious: “I stole from James Bond. It’s an homage.”  The slim,eighty-five-page script was cranked out in three weeks, in large part becausethey skipped all the action sequences, writing in those empty spaces, “This willbe choreographed by Mr. Bruce Lee.”In Hong Kong, Fred Weintraub was having less success. As he maneuvered toward asigned deal, the wily Raymond Chow politely deflected him at every turn. Tojustify spending $250,000 of his own money, Chow kept demanding more and moreforeign territories: Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan. After a week of conceding onecountry after another, an exhausted Weintraub finally concluded that Chow wasbargaining in bad faith, afraid that if the movie was made, Hollywood wouldsteal Bruce, his cash cow. On his final night in Hong Kong, Weintraub met Chowand Lee for dinner at a Japanese restaurant. Word got out that Bruce was in theestablishment, and thousands of fans appeared. “I saw the opportunity to playone final card,” Weintraub says. “ ‘Bruce, I’m leaving tomorrow because wecouldn’t strike a deal. It’s too bad Raymond doesn’t want you to be aninternational star.’ Raymond—dropping the facade of cordiality—stared at me withsudden, all-consuming hatred. In that instant he knew he had lost. Bruce said,‘Sign the contract, Raymond.’ ”For his part, Raymond Chow insists his reluctance was purely tactical: “BothBruce and I had already talked about the whole thing. All we wanted was a fairdeal. It’s very difficult for an independent producer to get a really fair dealwith a major studio.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]Having finally secured his long-cherished dream of a starring role in aHollywood kung fu movie, Bruce shelved Game of Death. “It was a relief toeveryone because it gave Bruce time to work on what the story was going to be,”says Andre Morgan, who was promoted to associate producer at Golden Harvest. OnOctober 29, 1972, Bruce flew to Los Angeles to work on the fine print of thecontract. Warner Bros. put him up in a luxury suite at the Beverly HillsWilshire Hotel.Bruce immediately phoned all his old friends and invited them over to his suite.Half the fun of success is showing it off. One call in particular he had beenwaiting a long time to make was to Steve McQueen. He ended up leaving a messagefor McQueen, who was out, to phone him at the Beverly Wilshire. Steve knew Brucewanted to brag. Instead of calling him back, McQueen messengered an 8x10 glossyphoto of himself, autographed, “To Bruce Lee, my biggest fan, Steve McQueen.”For days, McQueen dodged Lee’s irate calls. “That chicken, he knows what I’mgoing to tell him so he’s hiding,” Bruce complained to friends. When theyfinally talked, Bruce half-seriously shouted, “Steve, you dirty rat, I am a starnow too. I am a movie star! Don’t you send me this stuff!” McQueen howled withlaughter.After settling into his posh digs, Bruce asked to meet with the Americancreative team. Budget constraints largely dictated the American hiring process.Bob Clouse, who had made only two feature-length movies, was selected as thedirector because, according to Weintraub, “we could get him for a ridiculouslylow price.” Bruce found Clouse to be low-key and quiet—a good listener who wasopen to Bruce’s suggestions. He signed off on Clouse. He was less enthusiasticabout the screenwriter, Michael Allin.The entire Hong Kong team had reservations about the script for a variety ofreasons, ranging from the cost to film certain scenes to hoary stereotypes aboutthe Chinese. Bruce’s main concern was that the Americans would film and edit themovie in such a way that the white guy would look like the star and Bruce wouldbe the sidekick. The screenplay had been written with three multiracial (or“international” as they used to say) heroes, because the producers didn’tbelieve an American audience would watch a movie with a relatively unknownChinese actor as its sole hero. Williams, the strutting Blaxploitationcharacter, is the first and only hero killed off, per standard Hollywoodstorytelling, in the movie. Bruce’s character, conveniently named Lee, is thesame throughout the movie: he starts and ends as a highly efficient killer. Onlythe white character, Roper, has a narrative arc. He begins as a cynical rogue (aprecursor to Han Solo), who discovers his moral compass and heroic nature afterhis black friend, Williams, is brutally murdered. From his own personal history,Bruce had good reason to fear that once Warners screen-tested Blood & Steel inGlendale and reedited it to suit suburban tastes that Roper would be turned intothe Green Hornet and Lee would end up as Kato.When he first met with Allin, Bruce said, “We’ve got to rap, man! I’m at yourservice! I’m at your service!”  The scene Bruce wanted to rap about was at thecemetery where his character, Lee, talks to the tombstone of his murderedsister. Allin had included a deaf old lady who is sweeping leaves as Lee ispromising his sister he will avenge her death. “Why cut away to the old woman? Iwant to stand there and talk to my sister. Why do I have a person stealing thescene from me?”Allin then made a common novice-screenwriter mistake. Instead of agreeingimmediately with the star (“You don’t like the old lady? She’s gone!”), hedefended his work. “It was a wonderful little scene,” he recalls. “I was reallyproud of it.”As Allin tried to explain that the old lady was deaf and the symbolic importanceof deafness, suddenly Bruce perked up. “Ah, I see. She’s sweeping the leaveslike I’m going to sweep away the bad guys!”“Yes!” Allin cried. “Okay, Bruce, that’s the way it’s gonna—yes, yes! That’s theway to play it! You look at her and your subtext is: ‘I’ve got to go now becauseI’ve got bad guys to sweep up.’ ”“Yes, I really like that!” Bruce exclaimed.Allin was pleased he had saved the scene from a meddling actor, but Bruce wasupset Allin wouldn’t just do what he was asked. Bruce didn’t say anything toAllin. Instead he went to Weintraub and declared, “Either he goes, or I do.”Weintraub agreed immediately because he had no intention of actually firingAllin. To keep costs down, he had promised Allin a trip to Hong Kong in lieu ofpayment for the screenplay. Weintraub, who had a producer’s ability tocompartmentalize, told Bruce that Allin was fired and he never told Allin thatBruce wanted him fired.Negotiations over the contract proved equally contentious. Bruce madeconcessions on his salary but demanded script approval and directorial controlof the fight choreography. Not wanting any confusion about who was the real starof the movie, the Little Dragon also demanded that the movie’s title be changedfrom Blood & Steel to Enter the Dragon. “He was extremely obstinate andexacting,” says Weintraub. “The requests he made exceeded the decision-makingpower of an actor, encroaching on the territory of the producers and directors.Some of the higher-ups at Warner Brothers actually suggested I find someone toreplace Bruce.”The two sides were unable to come to a final agreement before Bruce wasscheduled to depart from L.A. and he left without a signed contract. Buoyed byhis recent success, Bruce appeared unconcerned. As his friend Peter Chincommented after driving Bruce to the airport that day, “When The Silent Flutewas rejected, Bruce felt like it was the end of the world, but today, he said tome, ‘I only have to give the word and ten production companies will make a moviewith me. If Warner doesn’t want to sign with me, it’s their loss.’ ”Bruce’s confidence proved well placed. Before he had even arrived in Hong Kong,Ted Ashley sent a telegram stating that Warners would take Bruce’s ideas intoconsideration and come back with a new offer in a week. On November 23, 1972,after a few more revisions, Bruce finally signed a contract with WarnerBrothers. Filming would begin in January and last eighty days. Bruce woulddirect all the fight choreography. Warners refused to give him final approvalover the script but fudged the issue by agreeing to send over the director and a“script supervisor” ahead of filming to give Bruce time to consult with them onhow to make the film appeal to both a Western and Chinese audience. Warners wasadamant that the film be called Blood & Steel. Bruce figured he could fight overthe title at a later date and believed he wouldn’t have much trouble getting thechanges to the script he wanted—after all, the producers had agreed to hisdemand to fire the original screenwriter, Michael Allin.Image [../images/sec.jpg]All of the actors were also hired on the cheap. Newcomer Jim Kelly was alast-second replacement for the Shaft-inspired character, Williams, afteranother African American actor, Rockne Tarkington, pulled out over money. Heaccused the producers of underpaying the black man. “We were colorblind,”Weintraub jokes. “We paid everyone poorly.”Bruce initially offered the role of Han’s evil bodyguard, Oharra, to ChuckNorris, but he refused. One movie getting beat up by Bruce Lee was more thanenough for the proud Norris, who had vowed he would never appear in another filmunless he was the hero.Hoping to appeal to Chuck’s competitive nature, Bruce said, “If you don’t takethis part, I’m going to give it to Bob Wall.”“Bob will do a great job,” Norris replied.The only person to receive an almost competitive salary ($40,000) was John Saxon(Roper). With the other roles filled by Wall (Oharra), Kelly (Williams), and Lee(Lee), Weintraub needed at least one name actor that Western audiences wouldrecognize and Saxon had a background in karate. Saxon’s agent predicted that themovie would be “a little crappy thing with a Chinese actor that nobody will eversee.” Saxon was persuaded to get on the plane only after Weintraub promised himhe would be the real star of the movie.Casting on the Chinese side was significantly less fraught. What seemed a paltryamount in Hollywood was untold riches in Hong Kong. It was also a chance to workon the first Hollywood co-production with the Little Dragon, the biggest star inHong Kong. Angela Mao Ying, star of the hit Lady Kung Fu, happily agreed to playSu Lin, the sister of Bruce’s character (Lee), who chooses to commit suiciderather than be violated by Oharra and his men. Bolo Yeung (Bolo) was a buddingactor. Shih Kien, who was famous for playing the villain in a series of moviesabout Hong Kong’s most popular hero, Wong Fei-hung, was Lee’s choice to play theone-handed, cat-stroking Mr. Han. The choice was deliberate: Bruce wanted tosignal to his Chinese audience that he was the inheritor of Wong Fei-hung’smantle.The role that proved most contentious to cast was Mei Ling, the undercover agentwho is Lee’s contact on Han’s Island. Bruce had promised the role to Betty TingPei. Their relationship had grown more serious. She had sublet an apartment inhis neighborhood of Kowloon Tong, only fifteen minutes by foot from his home.When asked if she had moved there on purpose, she said with a smile, “It was acoincidence.”When producer Paul Heller and director Robert Clouse arrived in Hong Kong inDecember 1972 and went with the whole crew to scout locations in Repulse Bay,Bruce invited Betty to accompany them. At lunch she sat next to Paul Heller. “Hecalled me Dragon Lady,” Betty says. “Everybody knew I was the girlfriend ofBruce Lee.” Chaplin Chang, the assistant director, remembers, “Betty was tellingPaul how talented Bruce was. Ra Ra Ra. A lot of things in praise of Bruce Lee.”The next week Bruce changed his mind and gave the role to another Betty—BettyChung, a popular singer. Given that it was a simple part with only a few lines,it’s not clear why Bruce didn’t want his girlfriend to play the part. Maybe hethought it was too indiscreet. Betty Ting Pei refuses to explain: “It is toodifficult to say. It would take too much energy.”Having lost a promised part in Way of the Dragon to Nora Miao and a role inEnter the Dragon to Betty Chung, Betty Ting Pei got into a heated argument withBruce. Afterward, he broke off their relationship and banned her from the GoldenHarvest lot. Betty was brokenhearted and despondent. One evening she swallowed ahandful of sleeping pills and called her mother. An ambulance rushed Betty toQueen Elizabeth Hospital. Betty’s mother angrily marched down to Golden Harvestto confront Bruce Lee. Executives intercepted her as she loudly announced thather daughter had tried to commit suicide. They shooed her away, dismissing it asa publicity stunt from an actress who had lost a part in a major movie. As if toprove them right, Betty’s mother then invited reporters into her daughter’shospital room. Betty didn’t answer their questions but let them take photos. OnDecember 23, 1972, New Lantern Newspaper ran the headline, “Betty Ting DeniesSuicide Attempt Yesterday,” and continued, “Ting had her stomach pumped aftermaking a mistake in taking her medication. Refusing to answer any questions,Ting, wearing a pair of sunglasses, only let the reporters get a glimpse of herbitter smile.”The newspaper never mentioned Bruce by name, but he got the message. Everyonewas gossiping about it. His friend Mito Uyehara, back in America, heard therumors and asked Bruce what happened. “That dumb girl took several pills andsaid that she’s in love with me and gonna kill herself if she can’t have me,”Bruce replied in a classic nondenial denial. “Shit, I can’t do much in that kindof situation. There are too many crazy people.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]On John Saxon’s first day in Hong Kong, in January 1973, Lee invited him to hishome and asked to see his sidekick. Standing in the middle of the room andfeeling a little foolish, Saxon flicked out a few kicks.“Not bad,” Bruce said. “Now let me show you mine.”As he had done so many times before, Bruce handed Saxon a padded shield to holdagainst his chest and placed a chair several feet behind him. Then Bruce did ahop, skip, and a jump and blasted into the shield. Saxon went flying back on hisheels and landed in the chair, which shattered. He was in shock for a fewmoments. Bruce ran over with a concerned look on his face.“Don’t worry,” Saxon said. “I’m not hurt.”“I’m not worried about you,” Bruce said. “You broke my favorite chair.”And that’s when John Saxon realized he was not going to be the star of themovie.Bruce was equally aggressive about the screenplay. He didn’t view Blood & Steelas a potential masterpiece but as a B-movie knockoff being made at sweatshoplabor prices. The movie’s purpose was to get his foot into Hollywood’s door andshowcase what he could do—a demo reel, a proof of concept. “It was supposed tobe his first international film and a sampler of greater things to come withbigger budgets, better sets, and more action,” says Andre Morgan. Bruce wasafraid the end product wouldn’t be good enough even for that limited purpose. Hebegan making demands of Fred Weintraub for major script changes. What Lee didn’tknow was that Weintraub had secretly brought the screenwriter, Michael Allin,over and installed him at the Hyatt Hotel with a directive to keep his head lowand avoid the actors. Through Weintraub as an intermediary, Bruce wasunwittingly arguing with Allin over his script yet again.Unable to get the changes he wanted to the screenplay Bruce boycotted the firstday of production. He then didn’t show up on the second or the third or thefourth. For a film on location with a tiny budget, this was a disaster.Weintraub sent Bob Clouse out to shoot random, B-roll footage of Hong Kong. Healso tried to reassure his Warner bosses that everything was fine. When theydiscovered what was happening, they sent Bruce a screenplay for a completelydifferent movie. Bruce met with Clouse, whom he’d come to trust, to discussditching Blood & Steel. Weintraub threatened Warners he would walk if theydidn’t stop interfering.“Bruce was under enormous emotional pressure: Was the film going to be goodenough or not? He wanted it to be more Chinese than American,” Linda says. “Hewas certainly distraught at times. At one moment, he would be feeling real highand ready to go. Ten minutes later, he would be in the depths of depressionabout it all. I had to psych him up at times.”It took twelve days for the two sides to come to terms. Weintraub agreed to anextended flashback that showed Lee’s sister being murdered by Han’s bodyguard,Oharra. Bruce was also promised the chance to direct an opening sequence thatwould establish his character as a Shaolin Temple monk. Beyond his concern thatthe Americans would reedit the movie to make John Saxon the star, Lee was deeplyworried about how the movie would be received by his Chinese fan base. TheAmericans had conceived of Bruce’s role as the Chinese James Bond, which seemedunproblematic to them. But to the Hong Kong Chinese, James Bond was an agent ofthe British imperial government. When Bruce was growing up, the only people theaverage Chinese hated more than the British were the Chinese police officers whoenforced, often corruptly, their unequal laws. In the script as originallyconceived, a British agent (Braithwaite) recruits Lee to arrest Han, who is evilbut also Chinese. Bruce had reason to fear his fans would view him as sellingout to the West by playing a sellout. By shifting the emphasis from a Britishoperative to a Shaolin monk, who was avenging his sister’s murder, Bruce wasonce again playing a heroic defender of the Chinese people.The length of his boycott and the anxiety it caused was evident on Bruce’s facewhen he arrived on-set for his first scene—a simple exchange of dialogue withactress Betty Chung (Mei Ling). He was suffering from a nervous facial tic. Ittook twenty-seven takes before it disappeared. Finally filming could begin inearnest.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Michael Allin had arrived in Hong Kong on January 3, 1973. He began working onchanges to the script from his room in the Hyatt, having been told there wasn’tspace in the studio for him. One day he was at the bar when Robert Clouse camein and said, “You’ve got to get out of here.”“Why?” Michael asked.“I’m going to have a meeting with Bruce and he can’t see you.”“Why? This is my bar. This is my hotel. What’s happening here?”“Nothing’s happening. You’ve just got to get out of here,” Clouse said, refusingto explain. Michael hid around a corner and watched as Bruce and Linda joinedClouse for a lunch meeting.Two weeks later, Allin noticed a picture of himself, Clouse, and Lee in aChinese newspaper. He took the article to the hotel’s publicist, whom he hadbefriended during his stay, and asked her to translate what it said.She quietly read it and said, “I don’t want to tell you.”“No, we are friends,” Allin pleaded. “Please tell me.”“It says here that Bruce Lee has sent the American writer home in disgrace.”In Bruce’s efforts to reassure his Chinese fans that he hadn’t sold out, that hewas in charge of this Hollywood production not the Americans, he had told theChinese press the story about how he made the producers fire the screenwriter.Allin realized why he had been kept hidden in his hotel room away from Bruce.Upset and angry, he decided to take a one-day vacation to Macau. On Saturdaymorning, he headed to the Star Ferry Terminal.Sometimes fate has a wicked sense of humor. That same morning Bruce decided tocheck out Golden Harvest’s marketing for Way of the Dragon. Wearing a velvetsuit and platform boots, he also went to the Star Ferry Terminal to look at hismovie posters plastered on the walls.Allin first saw the crowd that surrounded him, and then he made out Bruce withhis back turned to him. He was on a collision course. He walked up, and Bruceturned around.“Michael!” Bruce exclaimed, shocked to see Allin.“Bruce,” Michael replied.Bruce walked up to him and pointed his finger at his face. “Son of a gun,” hesaid, his steam rising. The crowd avidly followed the encounter.“Yep, nice to see you, Bruce,” Michael said to defuse the situation and thenhurried away to catch the hydrofoil to Macau.Bruce was apoplectic. He had told the press he’d fired the screenwriter. What ifthey discovered it wasn’t true? What a loss of face! Worse, he had beendeceived. He thundered through the Golden Harvest offices accusing everybody oflying to him. “We were all saying to him, ‘No. Really? He’s in town? Are yousure?’ ” Andre Morgan remembers. When he cornered Weintraub, Bruce jumped on topof an apple box to stare him in the eyes, stuck his finger in his face, and letthe dragon roar, summoning every English and Chinese curse word in his vastrepertoire. Bruce in full rage was a terrifying sight, but he had enough controlthat he didn’t hit Weintraub. He made it clear he was done with this film,stormed off the set, went home, locked himself in his den, and called WarnerBros. to inform them he was pulling out of the movie.Allin came back that night to find Weintraub at the bar. “It was the only time Iever saw him drunk in all the years I’ve known him,” Allin recalls.“What did you do to Bruce?” Weintraub asked Allin.“I didn’t do anything to Bruce!” Allin said. “What happened?”“It’s my fault. I told him you were gone and he saw you. He’s walked off thepicture.”“What are you going to do, Fred?”“Well, the first thing is you’ve got to leave.”It took several days to cajole Bruce back onto the set. If Hollywood executivesare good at anything, it’s getting talent to do what they want with awell-practiced mixture of sweet talk laced with veiled threats about breach ofcontract. Bruce knew if he blew this chance he might not get another one. Andwhile it had taken longer than he originally thought, he had managed to run offthe screenwriter in disgrace. He agreed to work with Clouse but refused to speakto Weintraub for a long time.Allin flew to Maui to cool his heels. “I was so furious,” he recalls.A week later, Weintraub called Allin. “You’ve really got to save us. Youremember that scene where you write about the black swan? The one where Roperand Han are touring the grounds and have this wonderful dialogue about the blackswan?”“Yeah,” Allin said, trying to stifle his anger.“We’ve looked all over Asia. We’ve gone all the way to Australia and we can’tfind a black swan. Michael, we need you to rewrite the scene. Please, I’ve got asecretary on the line. I know you can do it. Just—”“Fred, let me think,” Allin said. He put down the phone, went outside to thebeach, and took a dip in the ocean. Twenty minutes later, he picked up thephone. “Fred, you still there?”“Yes, yes, you got it?” Fred asked.“Yes, I do.”“Yes, the secretary is waiting to take it down.”“Okay, it’s very simple. Are you listening?”“Yes, yes, yes. Everybody’s listening.”“Get a duck that can act,” Allin said and then hung up the phone.Image [../images/sec.jpg]While Lee fought with the producers, the American and Chinese crews werebattling with each other. The problem was the Americans didn’t realize how muchEnglish the Chinese crew actually understood. “One day we were shooting thescene where Bruce Lee, John Saxon, and Jim Kelly transfer from the littlesampans to the big boat,” says Morgan. “We didn’t have walkie-talkies. We wereusing megaphones to cue. Someone yelled, ‘Cut.’ Out on the sampan, they didn’thear and kept going. Bob Clouse goes, ‘Fucking Chinese.’ The continuity guy,who’s this little old man, says in Cantonese, ‘That’s the last insult I’m goingto take from these fucking foreigners.’ With that, he takes his clipboard andhe’s coming over to hit Clouse from behind. We had to grab him and pull him offthe roof.”The Americans’ frustrations focused on the archaic equipment and the Chinesetendency to say yes even when they meant no. The Chinese disliked the Americans’arrogant attitude and tendency to yell at underlings. But despite theirdifferences, a mutual respect between the two groups eventually grew. “Weadmired how systematic the Americans were,” says assistant director ChaplinChang. “In Hong Kong, everything was either make it or get by with it.”The Americans grew to appreciate the Chinese resourcefulness, hard work, andcourage. One sequence called for henchmen to chase Angela Mao Ying, playingLee’s sister, along the edge of a canal until she kicks one of them into thewater. Weintraub and Clouse decided to shoot the stunt from the top of atwo-story building about twenty feet away from the canal. They took five of thestuntmen to the top of the building to map out the shot. After they explainedwhat they wanted through an interpreter, each of the stuntmen backed away fromthe building’s edge, shaking their heads. “We were surprised by theirtrepidation,” says Weintraub. “It was a short, four-foot drop, a pretty standardstunt.” Finally, one of the men stepped forward and said, “Okay, I’ll do it, butit’s going to be hard to reach the water from here on this roof.” Weintraubsays, “I was dumbfounded. Not only because they all thought we were crazy enoughto ask them to take such a hazardous fall but also because one of them wasactually crazy enough to do it.”Realizing how valuable the stunt crew was to the success of the movie, Lee wasexceedingly loyal and solicitous, continuing his tradition of eating a box lunchwith them every day instead of dining in the hotel restaurant with theAmericans. It was a kindness remembered by one of the dozens of stunt boys whoworked on the movie. “He was very good to us, the little people,” Jackie Chansays. “He didn’t care about impressing the big bosses, but he took care of us.”Watch closely during the battle scene in Mr. Han’s underground compound and youcan spot Lee whipping a young Jackie Chan around by his mop of black hair andsnapping his neck. During the first take, he accidentally cracked Chan in theface with his nunchakus. “You can’t believe how much it hurt,” Chan remembers.“As soon as the cameras were off, Bruce threw away his weapon, ran over to meand said, ‘I’m sorry, I’m sorry!’ and picked me up. Of all the things Bruce did,I admire him most for his kindness that day.”Accidents are inevitable on a kung fu movie set. A particularly painful injurywas sustained during Bruce and Bob Wall’s climactic fight. The scene called forWall to break two glass bottles and jab one at Lee, who would kick the bottleout of Wall’s hand and follow up with a punch to the face. After severalrehearsals Bruce’s kick missed, Bob failed to drop the shattered bottle, andBruce’s fist slammed into its jagged edge. “Bruce was very angry with Bob Wall,”says Chaplin Chang, who drove Lee to the hospital. “He said, ‘I want to killhim.’ But I don’t think he meant it.” Morgan says, “Was Bruce pissed off? Yes.But he knew it was an accident. He was mostly angry because we were going tolose two days of shooting.”The rumor that Wall purposely injured Lee and Lee intended to murder Wall wasfed to the Hong Kong press to hype the movie. By the time Bruce came back to theset, his ever-loyal Chinese stunt crew expected their champion to exact revenge.Although he came up with a face-saving excuse—“I can’t kill Bob, because thedirector needs him for the rest of the movie”—Chinese honor required some formof payback. The scene called for Lee to sidekick Wall hard enough in the chestto send him flying into a crowd of Han’s men. Bruce didn’t hold back. “They puta pad on Bob,” recalls stuntman Zebra Pan, “but he took off like he’d been shotwhen Bruce kicked him! And Bruce insisted on 12 takes!”  The force of Lee’s kickwas so great that Wall flew into the crowd, breaking a stuntman’s arm. “We’retalking complex break—bone through skin,” says Wall. “That’s when everybodywent, ‘Holy shit!’ I don’t think they realized how hard Bruce was hitting meuntil then.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]Navigating the tricky terrain of Chinese face required the producers to turnsome tricks when it came to hiring Han’s harem for the banquet scene. No Chineseactresses were willing to play prostitutes in an American film, so producerswere forced to hire the real thing. Responsibility for soliciting theprostitutes fell to Morgan, who knew his way around Hong Kong’s nightspots. Thedifficulty wasn’t finding them—along with Bangkok, Hong Kong was an R&R pit stopfor American soldiers serving in Vietnam—it was convincing them to take part inthe movie. “Never mind what they did for a living. That stayed between them andtheir customers. But if you commit it to film, how do you know your mother’s andfather’s friends are not going to see it?” Morgan says. “They wanted to be paidmore than I would’ve paid them if I wanted to sleep with them. To them, theindignity was far greater.” When the stuntmen discovered how much theprostitutes were being paid, they nearly went on strike.In the scene in which the three heroes are offered their choice of harem girls,the white guy (Saxon) selects the white madam (played by Ahna Capri), the blackguy (Kelly) selects four prostitutes, while the Asian guy (Lee) picks his fellowundercover agent (Chung) for a chaste discussion of strategy. The Chinese JamesBond was celibate. “He was a Shaolin monk,” says Michael Allin. “He was alwaysmeant to be: ‘You have offended my family and you have offended the ShaolinTemple.’ ”Sexual adventures continued off-screen too. “Jim Kelly screwed everything thatmoved in Hong Kong,” says Paul Heller. “He ended up in the hospital with bloatedtesticles. We had a harness for him to hang over the acid pit for his deathscene, but he couldn’t wear it, because he was so sore. We had to specially makea cargo net for him.”It was 1973 and everyone on-set seems to have enjoyed the era’s sexual freedom,including the Shaolin monk. “Once in a while Bruce would say, because we had abunch of Chinese girls there, ‘Why don’t we go out with some of them?’ ” saysSaxon.Image [../images/sec.jpg]The final scene Clouse and the American crew filmed with Bruce in Hong Kong wasthe climactic battle between Lee and Han in the funhouse hall of mirrors. In theoriginal script Han committed suicide before Lee could capture him. Bothdirector and star felt this was a disappointing ending and spent much of theshoot trying to come up with a better idea. One day after having lunch at theRepulse Bay Hotel, Clouse and his wife, Ann, walked into a clothing boutique.“The hall had all these thin mirrors, which I watched shatter her image as shewalked by them, and I said, ‘Oh, ho—that’s it!’ ” Robert Clouse remembers. ForClouse, it was a way to put Lee’s much younger character at a disadvantage tothe older Han (the actor Shih Kien was sixty) and make the final confrontationcompetitive and suspenseful for the audience. For Bruce, it was a chance todemonstrate the importance of “adaptability” in fighting—Lee breaks the mirrorsto differentiate between the real Han and his reflections.Two truckloads of mirrors were purchased for $8,000 and set up so every cameraangle displayed multiple reflections. As they filmed in the oppressively hot,mirrored maze for two days, Bruce went all out, forcing Shih Kien at one pointto call out, “Take it easy, son—this is only a movie.” Clouse says, “Toward theend of filming, Bruce was approaching complete exhaustion.”The American team wrapped and flew out on March 1, 1973. Bruce kept the mirroredroom set and continued filming with a small Chinese crew in the blistering heatfor another four days, seeking to perfect the ending. “Bruce by that time was sowound up he didn’t want to quit,” says Paul Heller.Bruce then went back to the beginning of the film to add the opening scenes atthe Shaolin Temple, which he wrote and directed himself. To increase the wowfactor, he began with a challenge match between himself and heavyweight stuntmanSammo Hung. It looked more like ultimate fighting than a kung fu battle—the twomen face off wearing nothing but Spandex shorts and padded gloves. “Duringrehearsal we didn’t do anything, we just talked. ‘You punch, I punch, yada,yada. Okay, ready? Action,’ ” Sammo says. “One take. One take. It was very fast,only a day and a half.”After the fight sequence, Bruce inserted a dialogue exchange with the abbot ofthe Shaolin Temple. Always seeking to educate his audience, Bruce’s on-screencharacter preaches Lee’s off-screen philosophies: “When my opponent expands, Icontract, and when he contracts, I expand, and when there is an opportunity, Ido not hit.” He holds up a fist. “It hits all by itself.”In a few brief minutes of film, Bruce had deftly managed to shift the emphasisof his character from a British agent to a traditional Chinese hero and to takeownership of the movie. “After you saw the opening sequences, you knew who thereal star was,” says Andre Morgan.There was only one battle left.When executives at Warners watched a rough cut of the movie, they immediatelysensed they had a blockbuster on their hands. “When we saw it, we knew we hadsomething,” says Leo Greenfield, head of Warner’s distribution. “God did weknow.”  Their confidence was greatly boosted in March when Warner Bros.purchased and distributed its first Hong Kong–produced kung fu movie—ShawBrothers’ Five Fingers of Death. Run Run Shaw’s chop-socky flick became asurprise hit with young and urban audiences, setting the stage for Bruce toexploit. If Five Fingers of Death, a subtitled movie with an entirely Chinesecast, could generate decent box office returns in America, how much greater wasthe potential for a multiracial kung fu flick filmed entirely in English?Ted Ashley gave Weintraub another $300,000 for Blood & Steel’s postproductioncosts. He also set into motion plans for a sequel. Realizing this was his momentof greatest leverage, Bruce insisted Warner Bros. change the title to Enter theDragon to make it clear that he, Little Dragon, was the star of the movie.Weintraub hated the title: “It sounded like a family film.” Ashley wasn’t happyeither: “While Enter the Dragon seems logical in that it permits the nextpicture to be called Return of the Dragon, the title gives the impression of amonster movie.” A series of polite but firm telegrams crisscrossed the PacificOcean over the next several months. As a compromise, Ashley proposed to Lee:“After spending a full two hours with our advertising department, it has beenresolved that the title which will give the picture the broadest dimensions isHan’s Island.” On June 8, 1973, Bruce shot back: “Do think it over carefullybecause Enter the Dragon suggests the emergence (the entrance) of someone (apersonality) that is of quality. Time is pressing, Ted. Do please send me thetwo scripts so I can work them over.”Bruce’s reference to the two scripts was a subtle jab. Warners had alreadycommissioned two follow-up screenplays for a potential franchise. But Bruce hadmade it clear through back channels that if the first one wasn’t called Enterthe Dragon he would never make another picture with Warner Bros. again. On June13, Ashley capitulated. “As requested we have given the title still furtherthought and have taken greatly into account your preference as well. The titlewill therefore be Enter the Dragon. Love to you and Linda.” Even Fred Weintraubeventually came around. “In retrospect I can’t imagine it being called anythingelse. As a former adman I should have recognized the value of branding in thefirst place.”"},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f0422-01.jpg]The grind of filming Enter the Dragon caused Bruce to lose twenty pounds,February 1973. (David Tadman)"},{"pageContent":"TWENTY-THREEKNOCKIN’ ON HEAVEN’S DOORA man of lesser ambition might have pulled back on the throttle or, at the veryleast, taken a vacation, but Bruce Lee had worked too hard for this moment toslow down now. He wasn’t content to be the first Chinese man to star in aHollywood movie; he wanted to be the biggest box office draw on the planet,bigger than Steve McQueen. “He was involved in such a whirlwind of activity thatthe goals he originally set out to achieve were rapidly being replaced by evenhigher goals,” says Linda. “I tried to talk him into easing up, but he would cutme short by saying, ‘The biggest detriment to relaxation is to say: I mustrelax.’ By this stage, he had convinced himself that he was relaxing when he wasworking.”The constant exertion was taking its toll. All of his friends remember Bruce aslooking gaunt and exhausted. In the previous two months, he had lost twentypounds, dropping from 140 to 120. “The pupils of his eyes were enlarged, makinghis eyes seem very dark,” says Sammo Hung, who costarred in Enter the Dragon.“His complexion was gray and pallid,” remembers Charles Lowe, the assistantdirector on Enter the Dragon. “He was tired and dizzy much of the time.”When the stress became too much, Bruce would go out for long dinners with one ofa handful of trusted friends. He and Charles Lowe often went to the Japaneserestaurant Kane Tanaka because it had private rooms. “He liked the calmatmosphere of the restaurant,” Lowe recalls. Despite his aversion to most typesof alcohol, Bruce had developed a taste and tolerance for sake. “He could reallydrink sake,” says Lowe. “He could drink ten or twenty of those incredibly tinysake cups.”Bruce kept burning the candle at both ends, because this was his moment ofgreatest opportunity. If he didn’t seize it, he was terrified it might pass himby. He had achieved a modicum of fame earlier in his career with The GreenHornet and watched it slowly evaporate to the point where he couldn’t pay themortgage on his house. That wasn’t going to happen to him again. This timeeverything had to be perfect.The early buzz from Enter the Dragon turned Bruce into a hot commodity. MGMwanted Lee to costar opposite his childhood idol—Elvis Presley, who was a blackbelt in karate. The Italian producer Carlo Ponti asked Bruce to costar in amovie with his wife, Sophia Loren. Run Run Shaw offered him $500,000 for hisnext picture, but Bruce didn’t think it was enough. “If Marlon Brando can get $2million, so can I,” he told a stunned John Saxon. Warner’s president Ted Ashleydesperately wanted to lock Bruce into a multi-film contract to turn Enter theDragon into a franchise. On April 22, 1973, Bruce wrote Ashley a letter warninghim he wouldn’t come cheap: “Nowadays, my offers for doing a film have reachedthe point which I guarantee will both surprise and shock you. . . . Because ofour friendship, I am holding up my money-making time—like ten offers from hungryproducers—to look forward to our meeting. You see, Ted, my obsession is to make,pardon the expression, the fuckingest action motion picture ever made.”Yet another offer was a blast from the past. Stirling Silliphant had signed amulti-picture deal with 20th Century Fox, and as part of it had secured a greenlight for The Silent Flute. On April 18, James Coburn flew to Hong Kong to lobbyBruce into rejoining the project. Bruce had grave reservations. Having starredin Enter the Dragon, he had little interest in going backward and playing thesidekick to Coburn’s hero. And he still had plans to make Northern Leg SouthernFist, his Chinese knockoff of The Silent Flute. But he kept his misgivings tohimself and gave Coburn the royal treatment, promising he would seriouslyconsider the project. “Bruce was pretty politically savvy,” Andre Morgan says.“Coburn was a big deal in Hollywood.”The more other producers offered him the less satisfied Bruce became withRaymond Chow. Bruce erupted over a story printed in Golden Harvest’shouse-written fan magazine that said Chow not only had discovered Bruce Lee butwas “like a babysitter” to him. Mostly they fought over money. After theincredible success of Way of the Dragon, Bruce was expecting wagonloads of cashto roll up to the doorstep of his mansion. Instead it arrived in trickles.Raymond argued that it was taking time for the theater owners to remit the moneyto Golden Harvest and besides much of it was earmarked to pay back the loansBruce had taken out for his mansion, Mercedes, and mink coat. Bruce believedthat Chow was cheating him and delaying his rightful share of the profits.Bruce needed the money soon because he had recently ordered a customizedconvertible Rolls-Royce Corniche from England. He also wanted to protect hisfamily financially in case something happened to him. On February 1, 1973, whilefilming Enter the Dragon, he took out a five-year limited life insurance policyfrom American International Assurance Company in the amount of US$200,000. OnApril 30, 1973, after the movie finished and all the huge offers began floodingin, he took out a second, much larger policy from Lloyd’s of London in theamount of US$1,350,000. It was a huge sum ($7.5 million in 2017 dollars) basedlargely on his future earning potential rather than his current net worth. Oneof the ironies of Bruce’s short life is that it was needed so soon.Image [../images/sec.jpg]May 10, 1973, was a typical Hong Kong summer day, muggy and oppressive. Thetemperature was 78°F and the humidity was 93 percent. After lunch, Bruce droveover to Golden Harvest studios on Hammer Hill Road, to “loop lines” for Enterthe Dragon. The dubbing room had an air conditioner, but it had been turned offto avoid having its noise ruin the soundtrack. Bruce spent about thirty minutesinside this ovenlike room, before excusing himself to go to the bathroom. Hefelt faint and his head hurt. In the stalls, he pulled out a bag of Nepalesehash and ate some of it.While in the bathroom, Bruce became disoriented and collapsed facedown on thefloor. The sound of approaching footsteps roused him. Unwilling to appear weak,even in this moment, he pretended that he had lost his glasses and was gropingaround for them. A studio worker helped him up, and the pale, sweating starwobbled back to the dubbing room on rubbery legs. The moment he stepped insidethe scorching room he fainted again, losing consciousness. Then he vomited hislunch of spaghetti and his body began convulsing.A frightened stagehand ran across the parking lot to Raymond Chow’s office andtold him that something was wrong with his star. Chow told his secretary to callDr. Donald Langford, an American at Baptist Hospital, and ran to the dubbingroom, where he found Bruce having difficulty breathing. He was gurgling andshaking in spasms. “Rush him to the hospital immediately,” Dr. Langford urged.Four workers carried Bruce to Raymond Chow’s car, and they drove him to thehospital. Bruce was in a bad state. He was sweating, shaking, and convulsing.One of the employees put a metal spoon between his teeth to prevent him frombiting his tongue.Dr. Langford was waiting outside for Raymond Chow when he pulled up with theunconscious and unresponsive movie star in his back seat. Three other doctorswere summoned, including a neurosurgeon, Dr. Peter Wu. Bruce appeared to besuffering from an extremely high fever, his breathing was sporadic, and hisshuddering body was bathed in sweat.Raymond’s secretary phoned Linda Lee. “Bruce is sick and they are taking him tothe hospital.”“What’s the matter?” Linda worriedly asked.“Oh, I think it’s a stomach upset,” she replied in stilted English.Believing it was something minor, Linda set off for Baptist Hospital, about afive-minute drive from their home. When she arrived, Bruce was gasping and everybreath seemed to be his last. “Will he be okay?” she asked, terrified.“He is very sick,” Dr. Langford replied.Dr. Langford was prepared to do a tracheotomy if Bruce stopped breathing again.His body continued to convulse violently. It took several doctors and nurses tohold him down, because he was extremely strong and difficult to control.Failing to get any response from Bruce, Dr. Peter Wu, the neurosurgeon, examinedhim and deduced cerebral edema (swelling of the brain). Dr. Wu administeredMannitol to reduce the swelling. Preparations for surgery were made in case thedrug didn’t work, but after two and a half hours, Bruce began to regainconsciousness. First he was able to move a bit, then he opened his eyes, then hemade a sign, but could not speak. He recognized his wife and made signs ofrecognition but could not talk. Later he was able to speak but it was slurred,different from the usual way he talked. By the next day, he was able to rememberaloud and joke.“Bruce was in a very critical condition,” says Dr. Peter Wu. “If he had not beenbrought to the hospital in time, he would have died from severe brain edema. Itwas sheer luck that experienced medical people were available to help him.”When Bruce was finally able to speak coherently, he told Linda, “I felt veryclose to death. I exerted my will and told myself, ‘I’m going to fight it—I’mgoing to make it—I’m not going to give up.’ I knew if I surrendered, I woulddie.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]On May 13, Dr. Peter Wu met with Bruce for a personal history to determine whathad caused the cerebral edema. During the conversation, Bruce admitted he hadeaten hash immediately before his collapse. “I advise you not to eat it again,”said Dr. Wu. “You’ve already had a very bad time with the drug. The effects arelikely to be worse the next time.”“It’s harmless,” Bruce scoffed. “Steve McQueen introduced me to it. SteveMcQueen would not take it if there was anything dangerous about it.”“Is Steve McQueen a medical authority?” asked Dr. Wu.Bruce was upset that the Hong Kong doctors blamed the hash for his collapse.When Dr. Wu scheduled an angiogram for the next day to examine his brain moreextensively, Bruce refused and demanded to leave.“Please take the brain tests,” urged Dr. Wu.“No, I want to be discharged,” Bruce insisted. “I will take the tests in theUnited States.”After his release, Bruce made arrangements to travel to L.A. for a secondopinion. He didn’t trust that the Hong Kong doctors knew what they were talkingabout, especially when it came to cannabis. In 1973, Hong Kong had very littleexperience with marijuana. It was considered an evil Western hippie drug.Research since then has proven that cannabis does not cause cerebral edema orlead to death. “There are no receptors for THC in the brainstem, the part of thebrain that maintains breathing and heart rate,” says Dr. Daniel Friedman, aneurologist at NYU Langone Medical Center, “which is why it is very nearimpossible to die directly from a THC overdose unlike heroin or barbiturates.”When Bruce arrived in Los Angeles, he went to see Dr. David Reisbord, aneurologist at UCLA. On May 29 and 30, Bruce was given the full battery of testsavailable to patients of that era: a complete physical, a brain flow study, andan electroencephalogram (EEG). As he awaited the results, Bruce called JohnSaxon, his costar in Enter the Dragon, to tell him he had come to town formedical tests.“What’s the matter?” Saxon asked.“I’ve been fainting.”“Why? Are you okay?”“Maybe if the tests don’t work out, there isn’t going to be a Bruce Lee.”After nervously waiting three days for the verdict, the news was good. Dr.Reisbord gave Bruce a clean bill of health. He had found no abnormalities in hisbrain functions and nothing wrong with his entire body. In fact, Reisbord toldBruce that he had “the body of an 18-year-old.” Reisbord concluded that Brucehad suffered from a grand mal idiopathic, which means a seizure with no apparentcause. Dr. Reisbord prescribed the drug Dilantin, which is commonly used totreat epilepsy. “None of Bruce’s family ever suffered from epilepsy, even in amild form, and Bruce had never suffered from it either,” Linda asserts. “Dr.Reisbord told me that at no time had Bruce suffered from epilepsy.” A diagnosisof epilepsy requires at least two separate incidents. This was the first timeBruce Lee had suffered a seizure.Image [../images/sec.jpg]The Hong Kong neurosurgeon blamed the hash. The L.A. neurosurgeon didn’t knowwhat caused the collapse. Neither of them considered a far more common cause forcollapse, seizure, and death in young, healthy men—heat stroke. The fatalityrate for young athletes and soldiers who suffer heat stroke is 3–5 percent. Itis the third most common killer of athletes and rises to first during thehottest months of summer. A common finding in the autopsies of patients who havedied from heat stroke is cerebral edema.The two criteria for diagnosing heat stroke in a patient are: 1) a core bodytemperature above 104°F, and 2) central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, whichincludes headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, loss of balance,staggering, irrational or unusual behavior, combativeness, delirium, collapse,loss of consciousness, and coma. Seizures also frequently occur, especially whenthe body is cooling.On May 10, Bruce experienced almost every symptom of CNS dysfunction associatedwith heat stroke. While exerting himself in a saunalike room, Bruce began tofeel dizzy and nauseous. This was followed by staggering, collapse, loss ofconsciousness, vomiting, and seizures. Since the medical records are no longeravailable, it is unknown if the doctors measured his core temperature, but theirreports that Bruce was “suffering from an extremely high fever and his body wasbathed in sweat” strongly indicate that he was dangerously overheated.While Bruce’s friends had long noted his vulnerability to heat (“Whenever he gotoverheated,” said his first American student, Jesse Glover, “his control wouldfade.”), there may have been specific reasons why he was particularlysusceptible during this period. Heat stroke researchers have identified severalrisk factors: sleep deprivation, physical and mental exhaustion, extreme weightloss, alcohol use in the previous twenty-four hours, illness in the previous twoweeks, and dehydration.According to his wife, Bruce was sleep deprived. By all accounts, the stress offilming Enter the Dragon had drained him physically and mentally. He had lost 15percent of his total body weight in the previous two months and he had minimalbody fat to start. His friends say he was drinking alcohol more frequently,although there is no evidence he imbibed the night before his collapse. And amonth prior to his collapse, Bruce underwent surgery to have the sweat glandsremoved from his armpits, because he felt his dripping pits looked badon-screen. Without these sweat glands his body would have been less able todissipate heat.If Bruce Lee’s collapse was the result of heat stroke, then his doctorsmisdiagnosed him. They caught the post-cooling complication of cerebral edemabut didn’t grasp or treat its cause. “There was less awareness of heat stroke in1973 than there is now. Even now heat stroke treatment and care is not known byevery physician,” says William Adams, MS, director of Sport Safety Policies atthe University of Connecticut’s Korey Stringer Institute, which specializes inthe prevention of sudden death from heat stroke and is named after thetwenty-seven-year-old Minnesota Vikings football player who died from heatstroke in 2001. “His doctors might have taken his temperature and mistook it fora high fever and not realized it was heat stroke instead.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]After his near-death experience, the positive test results were like a shot ofadrenaline. Bruce immediately returned to his old optimistic, energetic,confident self. He rushed over to the apartment where his mother and his youngerbrother, Robert, were staying in Los Angeles. “He looked skinny, he looked alittle tired,” Robert remembers. “He said, ‘You know what? The doctors tell me Ihave the body of an eighteen-year-old.’ He then showed off his latestinvention—a three-in-one kick, which was extremely fast and powerful.”He called up Chuck Norris for lunch at his favorite restaurant in Chinatown. “Ipassed with flying colors,” Bruce announced proudly. “The doctor said I had theinsides of an eighteen-year-old boy.”“What did he think caused you to pass out?” Chuck asked.“He didn’t know. Probably overwork and stress.”Bruce went on to tell Chuck about all of his accomplishments and the offers hewas receiving for movie deals. “They’re offering me blank checks for my nextmovie. Imagine it, I can fill in any amount I want if I’ll just sign with them.”He laughed delightedly and tossed a piece of Peking duck into the air with hischopsticks and neatly caught it. “You watch. I’m going to be the first Chinesefilm actor to become internationally famous. Before long I’ll be bigger thanSteve McQueen.”Mito Uyehara, the publisher of Black Belt magazine, visited Bruce and Linda attheir bungalow in the Beverly Hills Hotel. “He was very jovial because he hadjust been informed, after four days of rigorous medical examinations, that hewas in top physical condition,” Uyehara says. “But to me, he seemed awfully rundown. In all the years I knew him, I never saw him in such an emaciatedcondition before.”“Yeah, I’ve lost a lot of weight from working day and night,” Bruce explained.“During the day, I’m at the studio and at night I’m writing scripts for my nextmovie as well as reading books on the whole damn business of movie production.Yeah, it’s real fun and many times I’m so absorbed that I even forget to eat orsleep.”While Bruce may have been acting like nothing was wrong, Linda was still upsetand worried. Bruce proudly showed Mito a clipping that was written byeight-year-old Brandon in a Hong Kong newspaper. Linda snapped at her husband,“I hope we can return to Los Angeles as soon as possible. The kids can’t have anormal life there.”  The public rebuke, uncharacteristic for Linda, suggests along-simmering argument. She had never liked living in Hong Kong. She wasn’thappy with how the limelight had changed her husband and was terrified of whatit might do to her children. Bruce nearly dying was the last straw for her.Director Robert Clouse took Bruce to a special screening of a rough cut of Enterthe Dragon. The work print had no music, no fades or dissolves, nor any soundeffects. It didn’t matter. Everyone knew a winner when they saw one. After thefilm ended, Bruce looked over at Clouse for a few seconds before bursting into agrin. “We’ve got it.” Lee knew the world was his for the taking.Bruce stopped by producer Paul Heller’s house afterward. While he was there,Michael Allin, the screenwriter Bruce had banished from Hong Kong, rang thedoorbell. Heller called out, “Bruce, a friend of yours is here.”  The two formeropponents shook hands and chatted as if nothing had happened. “The picture wasgoing to be such a fucking success that there was no hatchet to bury,” Michaelsays. “It was over.”Confident that Enter the Dragon would be a blockbuster, Bruce made some majorlife decisions. He acquiesced to his wife’s wishes to move the family back toAmerica. Bruce decided he would split his time between America and Hong Kong,making one Hollywood and one Chinese movie per year. This way he could keep hisAsian fan base happy and expand his fame internationally. Having his family onanother continent would also allow him a great deal more freedom when he was inHong Kong.Bruce also decided to make a movie with Shaw Bros. He wrote a personal letter toRun Run Shaw: “As of now, consider September, Oct. & November, a period of threemonths reserved for Shaw. Specific terms we will discuss upon my arrival.”Then he called up Stirling Silliphant to tell him that he was turning down TheSilent Flute. Bruce was still resentful that Silliphant and Coburn had abandonedthe project when he needed it the most. “We were kind of starving then,” Lindasays. “After he is wildly successful they say, ‘We are ready to do it.’ ”“You can’t afford me,” Bruce told Silliphant. “I’m being offered a milliondollars a picture.”Silliphant was surprised and upset that Bruce was turning him down. “I thought Iwas close to Bruce and all I’d have to do was call and he’d agree,” Stirlingrecalls. “I was amazed by his reaction.”“I won’t carry Jim [Coburn] on my shoulders,” Bruce said, echoing a line SteveMcQueen had used on him. As they continued to argue, Bruce asked, “Will you makethe movie without me?”“We will,” Silliphant angrily said.“Where will you find anyone to replace me, to play five parts?” Bruce asked.“We will get five different actors to replace you,” Silliphant said. “If youwere to rejoin the project, I was going to suggest that you only play one role.Playing five roles would be old Hollywood Lon Chaney stuff.”“You can’t afford me anyways,” Bruce repeated.At the end of the testy conversation, they agreed to have dinner together, butBruce called back the next day to cancel it. He wrote a note to James Coburn:“Spoke to Stirling and I told him that between you and him I’ll thrust oursilent flute in your hands.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]After flying back to Hong Kong in early June, Bruce reignited his relationshipwith Betty Ting Pei. Betty had not heard about Bruce’s collapse, and he didn’ttell her he had nearly died. “I didn’t know,” Betty says. “He didn’t want me toworry. He told me he was the strongest man in the world.” Instead he gave her agift. “He brought me a keychain,” she coyly says now. According to tabloidreports at the time, attached to the keychain were the car keys to a brand-newMercedes-Benz.While Bruce’s letter to Run Run Shaw indicates that he intended to make at leastone movie with Shaw Bros., his business interests were still intertwined withRaymond Chow and Golden Harvest, which owned the rights to Game of Death. IfBruce wanted to finish his philosophical pet project, he couldn’t leave justyet. Excitement for the movie, which still didn’t have a complete script,increased after George Lazenby, the Australian actor who had recently playedJames Bond in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service (1969), called up the studio. Heclaimed to have seen Fist of Fury in America and said he wanted to work withBruce. In truth, Lazenby had blown all his Bond money and only came to Hong Kongbecause he had heard its movie industry was happening. For Bruce and Raymond,this was a chance to cast “James Bond” in Game of Death. Bruce began working onhow to fit Lazenby into the story line and decided to spend the rest of thesummer trying to complete the picture. He left open the option of making a flickin the fall with Shaw Bros.As Bruce was fielding million-dollar offers from European producers, Ted Ashley,who knew about Bruce’s collapse, made an emotionally clever proposal: $100,000 ayear for as long as he or Linda should live if he made five more movies withWarner Bros. “Frankly speaking, I am interested in this scheme,” Bruce told TheChina Mail in an article on June 28 headlined, “Bruce Lee Scoops a SuperstarSalary.” “It gives me security in the years ahead and makes taxation mucheasier. Besides, it doesn’t bar me from working with any other studio.” Andthen, with a laugh, he added, “I have great confidence in the studio. I think itwill outlive me.”For Bruce, the underlying appeal was obvious: it was another insurance policyfor his family. For Warners, it was a chance to lock in his talent. They werealready grooming him as their next big star. To promote Enter the Dragon,Warners had booked him on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in August.Image [../images/sec.jpg]All of this good fortune didn’t make Bruce any less combative. One of hisgreatest irritants was director Lo Wei, who continued to slight him in thepress. The afternoon of July 10, 1973, Bruce was in his office at Golden Harvestgetting high on hash when he heard that Lo Wei and his wife were in thescreening room. Bruce rushed into the darkened room, confronted Lo Wei about theinsults, and dished out a few of his own, calling the director “a beast in humanclothes.” “Bruce was slightly stoned and Lo Wei cursed him back in Cantonese,”Andre Morgan says. “Bruce threatened to punch him and then we had to pull themapart, literally. He was close to decking him.” As Bruce was hurried out of theroom, everyone tried to calm him down. It might have worked, if Lo Wei’s wife,Gladys, hadn’t confronted Bruce and reprimanded him.Enraged again, Bruce pushed past Raymond Chow and Andre Morgan, rushed into thescreening room again, and unsheathed a knife hidden in his belt buckle. Hepointed the blade at Lo Wei—just like as a teenager he had pulled a knife on hisPE teacher. “Do you believe I could kill you with this knife?” Bruce asked.Seeing the level of escalation, Raymond Chow and Andre Morgan once again draggedBruce out of the room. Lo Wei ran to the phone and dialed 999 (Hong Kong’sequivalent of 911). Once the police arrived there was a general panic. Brucegave Andre Morgan the knife and belt buckle. Morgan scurried out a back door anddown a secret passage to hide it.The police interviewed Lo Wei first. “What is the situation?”“Lee Little Dragon was threatening me with a knife.”“Alright, you’ll have to come with me to the station,” the deputy said.Lo Wei laughed derisively. “Don’t you get it? I am the one that has beenthreatened here. I am the plaintiff. You’re telling me to go to the station? Whydoesn’t Lee go to the station?”“He has a lawyer.”“And you are implying that I don’t?”A different officer came over and played good cop. “Hey, Mr. Lo, now don’t jumpto conclusions! That knife you were talking about, Lee got rid of it. We can’tfind it. Come on, you’re all colleagues! Don’t make such a mountain out of amolehill!”“I didn’t provoke him!” Lo Wei protested. “He’s not getting away with this soeasily!”“What do you want us to do about it then?” the good cop asked.“I just want to know that my life won’t be in danger again!”The officers went over to Bruce and told him if he wanted to settle the matternow he needed to write a letter admitting his mistake and vowing not to everthreaten or harm Lo Wei. By this point a group of reporters, tipped off by thepolice, had gathered outside the studio. Wanting to avoid further embarrassmentand loss of face, Bruce agreed to sign the note. When the police took the letterto Lo Wei to see if it was satisfactory, Lo Wei, ever the director, couldn’thelp but insist on a new line. “Little Dragon must add: ‘If anything happens tome and I am injured, he will be held responsible.’ ” It was too late for Bruceto back out now. Reluctantly he signed the updated version of the letter.To calm the situation, Raymond Chow invited Lo Wei and his wife out to dinner.They left through a back door. Bruce went out front to give his version ofevents to the press. He denied having pulled a knife on Lo Wei, ridiculing theaccusation. “If I wanted to kill Lo Wei,” he said, “I would not use a knife. Twofingers would be enough.” A year prior when Bruce was the fresh new thing, thismight have worked, but he had developed a reputation and the press had soured onhim. The newspapers and cartoonists criticized him. He was cast as the unrulyson acting disrespectfully toward an aging father.The next night Bruce had a scheduled TV interview with Ivan Ho, a popular talkshow host. Upset at the newspaper coverage, Bruce told Ivan during theirpre-interview meeting that he intended to deny he had pulled a knife on Lo Weiand demonstrate on Ivan why he didn’t need a knife to hurt someone. “I willpunch your arm only,” Bruce explained to Ivan. “When I hit you, you will feelsome strength. Don’t panic, it won’t hurt your shoulder. But don’t try toresist. Just relax and go with the blow and you’ll be alright. The audience willlove it when you fall on the sofa.”During the live interview, Bruce denied using a knife, said it was ridiculous tosuppose he would need one against an old man like Lo Wei, and asked Ivan Ho tostand up so he could show why. As they had practiced, Bruce snapped a blindinglyfast punch at Ivan Ho’s shoulder and Ivan went flying onto the sofa. Their skitworked as planned but the effect on the audience was not what Bruce anticipated.The punch was so fast it looked like Bruce had hit the popular host in the face.“The result was shocking,” Ivan Ho says. “Onlookers thought it was real. Theywere unaware of our pre-arranged set up. It seemed serious.”Bruce took another round of criticism in the morning newspapers for “bullying” apopular TV personality. For someone who was so good at charming people, Brucewas off his game. It is impossible to know if it was the sudden fame, the mentalstress, the physical strain, or lingering neurological damage from his collapse,but something was wrong with Lee.Image [../images/sec.jpg]A week later, on July 19, Raymond Chow and Bruce Lee had a lunch meeting withNancy Kwan, the star of The World of Suzie Wong and his student and friend fromThe Wrecking Crew. They wanted her to play the female lead in Game of Death. ButBruce was unable to focus on the task at hand. Irritable and frustrated, heloudly criticized Chow for refusing to pay him the money Bruce believed he hadearned. “He was saying that Raymond wasn’t being fair to him,” Nancy recalls. “Ididn’t even want to listen to it but he was going on and on and on aboutRaymond. He said, ‘I’m not getting what I deserve.’ ”“Bruce, what are you doing?” Nancy interrupted when she couldn’t take itanymore. “You need to behave yourself. You are criticizing Raymond, but everyoneis talking about you and Betty. You shouldn’t act like this.”“Oh Nancy, it doesn’t mean anything,” Bruce tried to play it down. “It’s just afling.”“Everyone is talking.”“It’s just a fling. I’ll get rid of her. She doesn’t mean anything to me. I haveplenty of girls.”“Think about your wife,” she said, scolding him like an older sister. “She is anAmerican over here alone with two kids.”“I love my wife,” Bruce said, stung by her words.“But it can’t be very nice for her, an American over here, and everyone istalking,” Nancy continued.Chow chimed in, “She’s right, Bruce.”“Shut up, Raymond,” Bruce snapped. “What do you know? It’s just a fling.”"},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f0438-01.jpg]Bruce Lee’s altar at Kowloon Funeral Parlour, July 25, 1973. (David Tadman)"},{"pageContent":"TWENTY-FOURTHE LAST DAY OF BRUCE LEEThe morning of July 20, 1973, Bruce typed a letter to his American attorney,Adrian Marshall, about several big deals on the table including themulti-picture offer from Warner Bros. and a proposal from Hanna-Barbera tocreate an animated series based on his life. There were also offers for books,clothing, and endorsements. Bruce Lee was building an empire.After finishing his letter and posting it, Bruce left his mansion in KowloonTong and drove to Golden Harvest’s studios. He met with George Lazenby, theAustralian James Bond, to further discuss his participation in Game of Death. Asthe only native English speaker at the studio, Andre Morgan joined them. SinceBruce had already shot much of the ending of the film, the goal was to come upwith ways to work Lazenby into the story. “We sat around shooting the shit,”Morgan recalls.After the meeting, Bruce swung by Raymond Chow’s office to say that he wantedLazenby in Game of Death. Chow suggested they all go out to dinner to formalizethe deal. Bruce returned to Morgan’s office. He pulled out his bag of hash andoffered some to Andre. They both had a nibble. Bruce and Andre were supposed totake George out to lunch, but Bruce had other plans and canceled. He wanted tovisit Betty Ting Pei’s apartment for a “nooner.”  The studio’s driver tookLazenby back to his hotel. Bruce promised to be back at the studio in theafternoon to settle how much money they were going to offer Lazenby.Bruce jumped into his Mercedes and drove away. He arrived at Betty Ting Pei’ssecond-floor apartment at 67 Beacon Hill Road around 1 p.m. It was a one-bedroomwith parquet flooring, wooden walls, and thick blue curtains. They spent thenext several hours alone together. “I was his girlfriend,” Betty says. There wassome sex and some hash, but no alcohol or harder drugs. Mostly Bruce was hypedabout his meeting with George Lazenby and what it meant for his movie. Heoffered Betty the role of the love interest. Betty claims she resisted the idea,because she didn’t feel comfortable playing his girlfriend on-screen while beinghis mistress in real life. “I never wanted to make the movie,” she says. “Iwould feel kind of embarrassed to face someone I love.”Raymond Chow arrived at Betty’s apartment around 6 p.m. It is not entirely clearwhy. Chow and Morgan had been waiting all afternoon for Bruce to return toGolden Harvest to work out the deal offer for Lazenby. Perhaps Raymond calledBruce to inquire when he would come back and Bruce told Raymond to meet him atBetty’s place. If Betty was reticent about accepting a role in the film, perhapsBruce wanted Raymond to help him convince her. Or maybe he just needed achaperone to drive them to dinner to avoid public suspicion.It was a scorching day—the temperature at 90°F and the humidity at 84percent—the hottest day of the month. “Bruce wasn’t feeling very well,” Chowrecalls. “I wasn’t feeling very well either. I think we had some water, and thenhe was acting.” In Bruce’s bubbling enthusiasm over Game of Death, he jumped upand performed scene after scene. “He was always very active,” Raymond says. “Intelling the story, he acted out the whole thing. So, that probably made him alittle tired and thirsty. After a few sips he seemed to be a little dizzy.”Immediately after feeling faint, Bruce complained of a headache. It was nearing7:30. They were supposed to pick up Lazenby for dinner. Betty had alreadychanged her clothes and was ready to go, but the pain in Bruce’s head had grownworse. When Bruce said he wanted to rest, Chow jumped up awkwardly and tried toleave. “Raymond thought it was an excuse,” Betty recalls with a smile. Bettygave Bruce one of her Equagesic pills—a common prescription pain medication. Shesays this wasn’t the first time: “Bruce had taken them before.”Raymond suggested he go first and they could come later. Bruce went into Betty’sbedroom, undressed, and sank into her mattress lying on the floor like a futon.Betty shut the door to the bedroom, went into the living room, and sat down onthe couch to watch TV. Raymond departed around 7:45 to pick up Lazenby at theHyatt and drive him to a Japanese restaurant at the Miramar Hotel.After thirty minutes waiting at the bar with Lazenby, Chow called Betty’sapartment. She told him Bruce was still asleep and Raymond and George shouldhave dinner without them. When Raymond finished his dinner with Lazenby at 9:30,he telephoned Betty again. She said Bruce was still asleep, but she would try towake him. Afraid of disturbing him, Betty opened the door slowly, crept into thebedroom, kneeled down beside him, and whispered, “Bruce, Bruce.” He didn’t stir.She pushed his shoulder and said a little louder, “Bruce, Bruce,” but he stilldidn’t wake up. Panic rising, she shook him and shouted, “Bruce! Bruce!”Betty called Raymond back at the restaurant in hysterics—she couldn’t wake him.Raymond told her to calm down. He would drive over to the flat immediately.Raymond flashed back to May 10, when Bruce had nearly died of a cerebral edema.He called Dr. Langford, the doctor who had saved Bruce’s life, at home, but hisline was busy. Raymond raced across town to Betty’s apartment. This was beforecell phones, so at stoplights Raymond repeatedly jumped out of his car to use apay phone to redial Langford, whose line remained busy. (He later learned thatLangford’s daughter was on the phone with her boyfriend.)When Chow arrived at the apartment, he found Bruce undressed, lying flat on hermattress, and Betty crumpled next to him in a state of shock.“Bruce, Bruce, Bruce,” Betty kept calling out, her voice hoarse.Bruce Lee did not respond. Raymond Chow realized he was too late. His star wasalready dead.As he stood there looking down on Bruce’s lifeless body and Betty’s sobbingframe, the enormous danger of the situation must have dawned on Raymond. Themost famous man in Hong Kong was dead in his mistress’s bed, and the two of themwere the only witnesses. The scandal would consume them. The press would blamethem. It could end their careers, maybe even put them in legal jeopardy. IfRaymond’s original imperative was to save Bruce’s life, now his immediate goalwas clear: Bruce Lee had to die somewhere else besides his mistress’s apartment.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Raymond re-dressed Bruce’s body. He buttoned up his shirt, put on hisEuropean-style trousers, and laced up his high-heeled platform boots. Chow mayhave considered moving the body—Bruce’s home was only a five-minute drive away.He may also have considered driving the body to the hospital himself—BaptistHospital, where Bruce had gone on May 10, was only a three-minute drive in theopposite direction. The death of a superstar at home or at a hospital wouldshock but not scandalize the public.Ultimately, Chow decided to bring in a doctor. He told Betty Ting Pei to callher personal concierge physician, Dr. Eugene Chu Poh-hwye, who worked at BaptistHospital. Betty implored Dr. Chu to come over to her apartment to treat a friendin need of help. She did not tell the good doctor the name of the patient or hiscondition.When Dr. Chu arrived, he found Bruce Lee lying in bed deeply comatose and notrousable. His pulse was not perceptible and the heartbeat was not audible. Therewas no respiration and no sign of life. He tried to revive Bruce for ten minuteswithout success.At this point, it must have been abundantly clear to Dr. Chu that Bruce Lee haddied before he arrived. It seems likely that Raymond explained to Dr. Chu thegravity of the situation and pleaded with him to drive Bruce’s body to BaptistHospital, which was only half a mile away, in order to limit the number ofwitnesses. Instead Dr. Chu decided to call an ambulance to treat a person whohad “collapsed.”  The ambulance officials were not told it was Bruce Lee or thathe was already deceased. Dr. Chu insisted that the “patient” be taken to QueenElizabeth Hospital, which was twenty-five minutes away, rather than the muchcloser Baptist, presumably because he didn’t want to bring this radioactivescandal to his place of employment. He would go along with the ruse but only sofar.Before the ambulance had even arrived, Raymond, the veteran producer, tookcontrol of the production. He told Betty not to say anything to the press. Thenhe called Bruce’s wife at her home: “Would you go to the Queen ElizabethHospital right away, Linda. Bruce is on the way there—in an ambulance.”“What’s the matter?” Linda demanded.“I don’t know—something like the last time.”It took seven minutes for the two paramedics and the ambulance driver to arriveat the scene around 10:30 p.m. The senior paramedic, Pang Tak Sun, found thepatient, who he didn’t immediately recognize, lying on his back on the mattresson the floor. Pang couldn’t find a pulse and the patient wasn’t breathing. Heperformed CPR and gave artificial oxygen. There was no change in the patient.The paramedics carried him to the ambulance. Raymond Chow and Dr. Chu jumped inback with them. The paramedics continued to treat Bruce’s lifeless body duringthe lengthy ride to Queen Elizabeth. Pang later explained why he continuedtreatment long after there was any hope of success: “As a first aid man even ifa person was apparently dead, I have invariably to treat him or her as a stillliving person and apply my first aid.”Linda arrived at Queen Elizabeth fifteen minutes before the ambulance. When sheasked about her husband, the man at the front desk said, “Somebody must bejoking—we don’t know anything about it.” She was about to call home when she sawBruce being wheeled past her into the emergency room. He appeared unconscious toher. A team of doctors began massaging his heart. “It never occurred to me thathe might die, let alone that he might already be dead,” she recalls. After aminute or so, they suddenly rushed Bruce upstairs and she had to run after thegurney to an intensive care unit. The team injected drugs directly into Bruce’sheart and applied electric shock. Someone tried to pull Linda away, saying, “Youdon’t want to see this,” but she struggled free and insisted, “Leave me alone—Iwant to know what’s happening.”  Then she noticed that the EKG machine recordingBruce’s heart was flatlined. The doctors finally gave up the macabre charade oftrying to revive a man who had died long before he arrived at the hospital. Onsome level Linda knew the truth but she still couldn’t admit it to herself. Sheasked one of the doctors, “Is he alive?” He shook his head.Linda wandered along the corridor by herself. The head of the medical team askedher if she wanted an autopsy. “Yes, I want to know how he died,” she said.Image [../images/sec.jpg]A little after 11:30 p.m. telephones across Hong Kong started ringing with thenews: Bruce Lee was dead at the age of thirty-two. The cause of death wasunknown.A call was made to Charles Sutcliffe, Hong Kong’s new police commissioner. Hewas hosting a party at his home on Victoria Peak for prominent members of themedia. As soon as word spread, all of his guests headed for the door. “Come backafter it’s over,” Sutcliffe told the reporters as they bolted for QueenElizabeth Hospital.One of Sutcliffe’s guests was Ted Thomas, the British disc jockey whointerviewed Lee in 1971. By the time Thomas and his colleagues arrived, thepolice had already cordoned off the hospital. A scrum of TV cameramen andnewspaper reporters were staking out the entrance. “Nobody got in,”  Thomassays.Without any official announcement, rumors swirled among the journalists outsidethe hospital about how Bruce Lee had died. At nearby pay phones reportersfrantically called their sources. One of them reached Charles Lowe, theassistant director on Enter the Dragon and Bruce’s sake drinking buddy.“Someone told me Bruce Lee died in a fight,” the reporter said. “Can youconfirm?”“Rumors!” Lowe replied with a sinking feeling. “It’s just a rumor.”“He was beaten up by ten or twenty people in Tsim Sha Tsui,” the reportercontinued, “or maybe you already know?”“You’re crazy!” Lowe shouted and hung up.Worried, he called over to Bruce’s residence. Eight-year-old Brandon picked upthe phone. “Is your dad home?” Lowe asked.“No home,” Brandon said in Cantonese.“Where is he?”“Movie! Movie! Movie!”Image [../images/sec.jpg]As Raymond and Linda approached the doors of the hospital to leave, the entrancelit up with the flashes of photographers’ bulbs. Seeing they were trapped, theyretreated. Raymond telephoned his wife and asked her to pick them up. Realizingthe media would swarm Bruce’s home, Chow then called Dr. Langford, who livednearby, and asked if he and Linda could stop by his house.Linda suddenly insisted on going back to see her husband one more time to makecertain that he was really gone. Standing next to his body, she says, “I felt anincredible strength surge through my body and spirit. The determination andcourage of Bruce himself passed to me. In a flash I knew what lay ahead and howI should deal with everything in the best possible way for Bruce, Brandon, andShannon.”At 12:30 a.m., the police arrived at Betty Ting Pei’s apartment. They did nottell her that Bruce was dead. Deeply upset, she could not bring herself to askabout his condition. After the ambulance had left her apartment building, shehad called her mother and her younger brother, who were there comforting her asthe police searched the premises. They found no sign of struggle or a physicalaltercation. The mattress on the floor was neatly made up. They put intoevidence three glasses on the living room table, two half-empty bottles of 7-Upand Schweppes Ginger Beer, and an opened tinfoil package of Equagesic pills.Betty gave a full statement to the police. Given the consistency of Raymond’sand Betty’s later testimony, it seems likely he had already coached her in whatto say. She was a professional actress and skilled at memorizing her lines.Raymond had successfully raised Bruce Lee from the dead just long enough that hecould officially die somewhere besides Betty’s apartment. To complete thecover-up, he needed to stage-manage one other player in this morbid drama.He arrived with Linda at Dr. Langford’s house around 1 a.m. Linda wasdistraught. She didn’t know what to do, what to tell the reporters. She lovedher husband and was enormously proud of him.“What do you know about Bruce and other women?” Linda asked Dr. Langford. “Washe a philanderer?”“To the best of my knowledge,” Dr. Langford answered carefully, “he had no otherrelationships.”“The Hong Kong press will devour him,” Linda said. “How do I keep them fromsaying tawdry things?”Linda deliberated with Raymond in Dr. Langford’s living room. Together theydecided what statement they’d give to reporters.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Andre Morgan received a call from Raymond Chow in the middle of the night. Herushed over to Golden Harvest where Chow was already in full damage control.Morgan was assigned to write the English-language press releases, while Raymondauthorized the releases to the Chinese media. After some internal debate, GoldenHarvest settled on the wording of its written statement: Bruce Lee collapsed athis home while walking in his garden with his wife, Linda. Golden Harvest mournsthe loss of a great star.Around the same time Queen Elizabeth Hospital released its formal explanation:the actor Bruce Lee died of an acute cerebral edema. The cause of the edema isyet unknown.Based on these two accounts, the Hong Kong press reported to the public thattheir hero had died from a brain edema of unknown origins while strolling in hishome garden with his beloved wife. “We wanted to protect Bruce’s image andreputation and to protect Linda’s and the children’s feelings,” explains Morgan.“We were not stupid enough to believe that we were not going to get tagged out.It was a matter of how long we could delay.”This fabricated version of Bruce Lee’s death held up for three days.Image [../images/sec.jpg]H. S. Chow, an intrepid reporter who had profiled Bruce Lee multiple times forThe China Mail, was suspicious of Golden Harvest’s picturesque account and begancalling his sources. Every Hong Kong hospital kept a written ambulance loglisting pickup addresses. It took only two days for Chow to find the rightambulance log, track down the driver, and convince him to talk. Ambulance #40had picked up Bruce Lee from a second-floor apartment at 67 Beacon Hill Road,but Bruce’s home was at 41 Cumberland Road. After a few more phone calls, H. S.Chow discovered that the occupant of the Beacon Hill Road apartment was BettyTing Pei. “Bless H. S. Chow’s heart,” says Morgan. “We later hired him to be oneof Golden Harvest’s PR flacks.”In 1973 Hong Kong had four English-language dailies and 101 Chinese papers, allfighting for a circulation totaling one and a quarter million readers. Out ofthis cutthroat environment was born the notorious “MosquitoPress”—sensationalist scandal sheets that “print with a sting.”  The discoveryof the cover-up—Hong Kong’s most famous star actually died in the flat of anattractive actress—caused the Mosquitoes to swarm. Under the headline “Who’sLying on Li’s Death,”  The China Mail wrote, “Film star Bruce Li spent his lasthours at the flat of beautiful actress Ting Pei—not at his own home as waspreviously reported.” Reacting to the revelation, The China Star splashed acrossits front page: “Bruce Lee Shock.”Having been tagged out so quickly, Raymond Chow stopped taking press calls andtried to regroup. Betty was left alone in her apartment to face the media. Shemade the foolish error of doubling down on the initial fabrication. “On Fridaynight when he died I was not at home—I had gone out with my mother,” she claimedto reporters. “I last met him several months ago when we came across each otherin the street.” Bruce’s older brother, Peter, supported her story and dismissedThe China Mail’s allegations as “fantasy.”To contradict her assertion, the tabloids interviewed Betty’s neighbors, whoconfirmed that Lee had been a regular weekly visitor to her apartment for monthsprior to his death. The China Star ran a double-entendre headline: “Betty TingPei’s Fragrant Chamber Killed the Dragon.”After days of mauling in the press, Raymond, in coordination with Linda andBetty, came up with a new cover story. In a classic example of rollingdisclosure, they admitted what could not be denied and denied what the presscould not prove. To protect Bruce’s reputation as a family man for Linda’s andthe children’s sake, not to mention the large investment Golden Harvest had madein the soon-to-be-released Enter the Dragon, they refuted any romanticrelationship between Bruce and Betty. To avoid legal jeopardy for Betty andRaymond, they maintained that Bruce had died at Queen Elizabeth Hospital. All ofthis required concocting a new timeline. It could not be admitted that Bruce wasalone with Betty. He needed a chaperone.According to Linda’s new account, “it was around noon on July 20, 1973, and Iwas prepared to leave our Kowloon house to lunch with a girlfriend. Bruce was inhis study. He told me that Raymond Chow was due to come over that afternoon totalk about script ideas for Game of Death, and that they would probably dinelater with George Lazenby. Bruce was his usual industrious self when I left him.That was the last conversation I ever had with my husband.”Raymond, who was Bruce’s business, not his writing, partner, claimed that hearrived at Bruce’s house at 3 p.m. Together they worked on the script for Gameof Death until 5 p.m. before they drove to Betty Ting Pei’s apartment to offerher a leading role in the movie. It was a business meeting and nothing else.Betty and Bruce were just friends.At 7 p.m. Bruce complained of a headache. At 7:30 it grew worse and Bettyoffered him one of her Equagesic pills, which consists of 325 mg of aspirin and200 mg of meprobamate—a mild muscle relaxant. Bruce went into Betty’s bedroom tolie down. Raymond left to pick up Lazenby.After Raymond called several times to inquire about Bruce, Betty discovered shecouldn’t wake him. Raymond drove over to the flat immediately. When Raymondarrived at the apartment, Bruce appeared to be very sound asleep. His attemptsto rouse Bruce failed. Betty called her personal physician, Dr. Eugene ChuPoh-hwye to come over to her apartment and treat a friend. After Dr. Chuexamined Bruce, he called an ambulance and instructed the paramedics to takeBruce to Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Bruce was officially declared dead at thehospital at 11:30 p.m.This updated version of Bruce Lee’s death would hold up for thirty years.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Bruce’s older brother, Peter, identified the body at the mortuary of QueenElizabeth Hospital at 2:30 p.m. on July 23. In accordance with Linda’s wishesand the police investigation, a full autopsy was performed after theidentification by Dr. R. R. Lycette. “The body is that of a well-built Chinesemale of about 30 years of age and is 172 cm in length,” states Dr. Lycette’sautopsy report. His examination found no evidence of foul play. “The scalp isfree of bruising and the skull shows no evidence of fracture or injury, eitherrecent, or old. There are no recent or old needle marks.” His heart was normalas were the blood vessels in his brain. Bruce didn’t die of a heart attack or abrain aneurysm. The only abnormalities Dr. Lycette could find were congestion inthe lungs, intestines, and kidneys, and swelling in the brain. “The brain isvery tense beneath the covering dura. The brain weighs 1,575 grams. A normalbrain weighs up to 1,400 grams.”His conclusion: “Congestions and edema of the brain (i.e. excessive fluidaccumulation), were the immediate cause of death. The congestion of the lungsand other organs is strongly suggestive of the brain edema first stoppingrespiratory function, while the heart continued to pump blood into the body’sarteries, which were dilating because of lack of oxygen. The edema finallycaused failure of cardiac centers in the brain and stopped the heart.”While Dr. Lycette was certain that an acute cerebral edema (brain swelling)killed Bruce, the reason for the edema was a mystery. “The findings provide nodefinite evidence as to the cause of the cerebral edema.”  The last line of theautopsy did suggest a line of investigation: “It is possible that the edema isthe result of some drug intoxication.”What led Dr. Lycette to this conclusion were the two items he found in Bruce’sstomach: remnants of the Equagesic pill and small traces of cannabis (hash).Suspecting cannabis, Dr. Lycette met with Dr. Donald Langford and Dr. Peter Wu,the two doctors who had saved Bruce’s life on May 10. Langford and Wu werealready convinced cannabis was responsible for his first collapse. Theypersuaded Dr. Lycette it was the leading candidate for his death on July 20. “Ibelieve the most likely cause of death is cannabis intoxication,” Dr. Lycettewrote in a letter, “either due to drug idiosyncrasy or massive overdose.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]Almost as soon as Dr. Lycette discovered hash in Bruce’s stomach, someone in hisoffice leaked it to the press. Surprisingly, in a colony which in 1973 recordedthe seizure of 1,748 kilos of opium, 399 kilos of morphine, and 50 kilos ofheroin, cannabis was still regarded by the Hong Kong police, press, and publicas a major evil—a deadly Western hippie drug that turned kids against theirparents. The tabloids broadcast that Bruce Lee had been using marijuana beforehe died. The story had all the elements for a perfect scandal: sex, drugs,deception, and death. “The Hong Kong press simply went wild,” Linda recalls.Bruce’s afternoon rendezvous with Betty was turned into a drug-fueled orgy.Starting with the leaked marijuana story, the press piled on substance afterillegal substance, turning him from a fitness freak into a junkie. The tabloidsreported as fact to their credulous readers that Bruce had died from an overdoseof “707,” Hong Kong’s equivalent of Spanish Fly—a supposedly potent sexualstimulant in the days before Viagra. Then they linked Bruce to a cornucopia ofother drugs ranging from LSD to heroin to cocaine. On July 25, The OrientalDaily wrote, “It has come to our attention that a straw and several paperbaggies full of powder were found by Lee’s deathbed.”Starting with “scarlet woman” Betty, the press piled on starlet after starlet,turning Bruce from a superhero into a superstud. “The press decided they couldadd some spice to the story by not only including Betty Ting, but all his ‘othermistresses,’ ” says Andre Morgan. “What they did was to go back through all thefiles and got every photograph of him with a well known actress posing together.They had five pages of him with different chicks, you know, the arm around,smiling, the whole bit. The stories were rampant, stories about him dying froman overdose, dying from screwing too much, dying with an erection, dying frombeing hacked to death by young thugs, poisoned by his servant. There was onestory that he wasn’t really dead.”Many admirers simply could not accept that someone as young and vital as BruceLee had departed. The China Mail reported that Malaysians in Penang believednews reports of his demise were a ghoulish publicity stunt for Game of Death:“The fans have been entering into heated argument over the issue and are evenplacing bets.”Because Bruce blurred the line between his life and his big-screen persona, manyof his fans wanted to transform his death into one of his movies. “There aresome who think Japanese martial artists might have taken a hand in Lee’s death.Besides the traditional Japanese-Chinese rivalry, Lee always saved his specialvenom for Japanese karate and judo,” wrote Alex Ben Block in the first biographyof Bruce Lee (1974). “In Japan there is a tradition of assassins known as Ninja.Every Ninja was an accomplished pharmacist, skilled in preparing differentpoisons.”If it wasn’t ninjas, it might have been a jealous kung fu master armed with themagical superpower of the delayed death touch—dim mak in Cantonese. “A Malaysiannamed Kay Wah Lee has dedicated most of his adult life to studying the ancientdelayed-death-strike system,” wrote Block. “He claims it’s possible to walk downthe street, lay his hand on a victim, and two years later to the day (orwhatever elapse of time is desired), the victim will die.”While the press entertained these kung fu movie fantasies, most of the scandalsheets reveled in carnal conspiracies. “During a recent taxi ride in Taiwan, theconversation steered around to Lee’s death,” wrote Don Atyeo in the second BruceLee biography (1975). “ ‘Ah yes,’ nodded the cab driver knowingly, ‘too muchsex.’ Which in a nutshell sums up much current popular Eastern sentiment.”Rumors that Lee died with an erection were so prevalent that tabloid reportersbribed their way into the mortuary to snap photos of his cadaver. “I paid themorgue beautician HK$1,500 to let me take pictures of Lee’s corpse,” saysPatrick Wang, founder of the Kam Yeh Pao tabloid. “After snapping his face, Itried to photograph further down his body. The woman shoved me aside and draggedme out of the morgue, saying that I would get her fired.”While Patrick Wang wasn’t able to prove priapism, his photographs of Bruce’sface did show bloating. When film from Bruce’s Hong Kong funeral also captured aswollen and distorted face underneath the glass of his coffin, it set off a newround of conspiracy theories: a bloated face proved Bruce was poisoned!According to Andre Morgan, the explanation was more prosaic—Bruce’s face wasswollen because of a botched embalming job. “Most bodies in Hong Kong arecremated because burial spots are so expensive,” Morgan says. “The truth is theywere really awful embalmers.”After Bruce’s Hong Kong funeral, Linda Lee issued a public statement from KaiTak Airport before leaving to bury her husband in Seattle. She implored thepress and populace to stop speculating about Bruce’s death. “Although we do nothave the final autopsy report, I have no suspicion of anything other thannatural death,” she said. “I myself do not hold any person or people responsiblefor his death. Fate has ways we cannot change. The only thing of importance isthat Bruce is gone and will not return.” A Golden Harvest representativepleaded, “Now that a great star is dead, it’s the wish of most film people tolet him die a hero. The reports, if true, will undoubtedly ruin his image. Andthey will break the heart of numerous Lee fans.”Brokenhearted Hong Kong fans were furious that Linda was taking Bruce’s body toSeattle. “There was a lot of hostility, anger, and suspicion,” says Morgan.“Suspicion there had been foul play, that it was all a setup, that he had beenkidnapped.” In an attempt to allay these suspicions, Golden Harvest sent acameraman to film Bruce’s funeral in Seattle and send back the footage for newsreports in Hong Kong, but it only made matters worse.To legally transport his body from Hong Kong to America, Bruce’s coffin, whichhad a white silk interior and a protective glass enclosure around his body, wassealed inside a lead-lined shipping container and then laid inside a woodenshipping crate. When the crate was opened in Seattle it was discovered that thecoffin had rubbed against the lead lining during transport, severely marring theexterior. When the casket was opened, Andre Morgan saw that the white silkinterior had been stained blue from Bruce’s suit. “The freight area of a 747 isnot pressurized,” Morgan explains. “Before we left, the glass had sealed the 89degree and 98 percent humidity Hong Kong air inside the coffin. When the 747leveled off at 38,000 feet, the air condensed on the glass and started to drip.It was like a small rainstorm inside his coffin.” Morgan decided a new coffinwas needed and purchased the closest model available: “It was slightly darkerbrown with a pleated velvet interior.”Sharp-eyed viewers back in Hong Kong noticed the casket was different andaccused Golden Harvest of switching the bodies. “It all spun out of control,”says Morgan, “from what were very easy things to explain.” Attempts to clarifyonly led to more speculation. The scratched and stained casket was taken as asign that Bruce’s soul was not resting peacefully. Suddenly, everyone became asoothsayer looking for omens. Some blamed bad feng shui: On July 18 a typhoonstruck Hong Kong and carried away the feng shui reflector—a small octagon woodenframe—Bruce had installed on his roof, but, before he could replace it, he wasdead. Others believed he was cursed: when Lee Little Dragon took up residence inthe neighborhood of Kowloon Tong, which is Cantonese for “Nine Dragon Pond,” itcaused anger and rivalry among those magical beasts, who struck him down.Image [../images/sec.jpg]All of this fevered speculation had real-world consequences. The press houndedBetty Ting Pei. “It seems that people want me to die,” she lamented to The ChinaStar, “and if this continues, I just don’t want to live on. Bruce is dead. Whydon’t you leave it at that?” When her appeals for mercy failed to stop theonslaught of negative stories, she threatened to sue the press if the libelcontinued. In response, one of the tabloids ran a front-page headline: “BettyTing, Sue Us!” over a fresh list of disclosures, causing the twenty-six-year-oldto lock herself in her apartment. One of her close friends revealed, “Shedoesn’t do much of anything except watch television.”The virulence of the coverage and the festering stew of suspicion quickly took aturn for the truly frightening. Students in Kuala Lumpur demonstrated carryingplacards that read: “Betty Killed Bruce.” Rumors began spreading in Hong Kongthat a hit had been taken out on her life. In early August, a bomb threat wascalled in to the police. They discovered in a public square a suspicious brownpaper package covered in Chinese writing: “Betty Ting knows the cause of BruceLee’s death.”  The bomb turned out to be a hoax, filled only with rubbish, butover the next few weeks three more fake bombs were planted across the city withsuch messages as “Revenge for Bruce Lee.”The British colonial government could safely ignore a celebrity scandal, butbomb threats were another matter. Memories of the 1967 leftist riots, whichendangered British control of Hong Kong, were still raw. A minor labor disputehad sparked a violent revolt. Pro-Communist Chinese radicals, who wanted to pushthe British out and rejoin mainland China, planted real bombs, mixed with evenmore decoys, throughout the city—over eight thousand in total by the end.Pro-British politicians, journalists, and police officers were killed, as weremany innocent victims.As concern grew that the current situation might spiral into widespread strife,the government felt compelled to act. Officials ordered a full-scaleinvestigation into Bruce Lee’s death."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f0454-01.jpg]South China Morning Post article after Linda’s testimony at the coroner’sinquest, September 18, 1973. (Courtesy of Steven Hon/South China Morning Post)"},{"pageContent":"TWENTY-FIVETHE INQUESTThe legal mechanism for the investigation of Lee’s demise was a coroner’sinquest—a court inquiry presided over by a judge and three jurors. Rarely used,except in high-profile cases like Jimi Hendrix’s death in London, its statedpurpose was to categorize the type of death—suicide, homicide, natural causes,or accidental—for any future legal proceedings. For example, a determination ofhomicide would be a prerequisite for a criminal trial, while a ruling of suicidemight allow the life insurance company to avoid paying out a settlement.In calling for an inquest, the government’s goal was not to find the explanationfor Bruce Lee’s death but to provide an explanation—something palatable,preferably not scandalous, that would placate the masses. Hong Kong was acolony, not a democracy. British officials didn’t care why some Chinese kung fuactor had died; they cared about quelling the unrest and maintaining control. Toachieve their objective, the government needed to give the appearance ofopenness and thoroughness while quietly manipulating the outcome behind thescenes. An interdepartmental memo was circulated warning civil servants againsttalking to the press.On September 3, 1973, all the actors in this rigged courtroom drama arrived withtheir own lawyers and their own secrets. The magistrate of the inquest, JudgeElbert Tung, and the public prosecutor, Joseph Duffy, represented thegovernment’s interest in creating the facade of a fair and transparentproceeding. Raymond Chow, Betty Ting Pei, and their individual lawyers wanted tomaintain the fiction that Bruce and Betty’s relationship was purelyprofessional, while at the same time deflecting blame for his death. Linda andher lawyer needed to deny that Bruce was a longtime cannabis user, because therewas yet another party invested in the outcome of the inquest: the insurancecompanies.Just before his death, Bruce had taken out two major life insurance policies:one from American International Assurance Company (AIA) in the amount ofUS$200,000 on February 1, 1973, and the second from Lloyd’s of London forUS$1,350,000 on April 30, 1973. Insurance companies hate paying out policiesthat have run for thirty years, let alone only three months. AIA sent its ownlawyer, David Yapp, to the inquest to try to nullify the policy by proving thatBruce had lied on the application. One of the questions was: “Have you ever usedillegal drugs?” On February 1 Bruce had answered, “No.”  To void the policy, theAIA insurance lawyer needed to prove Bruce began using cannabis prior toFebruary 1, 1973. To secure the insurance money, Linda had to deny it.When Betty Ting Pei, Raymond Chow, and Linda Lee arrived at 9 a.m. at Tsun WanCourt, the scene was as chaotic as the O. J. Simpson trial. They were greeted byover a hundred reporters and several thousand noisy fans held back by policebarricades. The parking lot and four surrounding roads were all blocked off totraffic, and the entrance to the courthouse was tightly controlled by thepolice, who escorted the witnesses through the crowds.The courtroom gallery, with room for two hundred people, was packed to the gillswith members of the press and public. At 10:20 a.m. the inquest began with theswearing in of the three-man jury who would decide the case—Fun Kee Wai, RobertFrederick Jones, and Kan Yuet Wan Ramon. The magistrate, Judge Tung, explainedthe case to the jurors: “The goal will be to determine the manner of death ofAmerican citizen, Bruce Lee, through consideration of the testimony of relatedparties. This determination will further act as the basis for any subsequentlegal action.” Because it seemed likely that Bruce’s May 10 collapse was linkedto his July 20 death, the judge said that the court would be calling upon thedoctors who treated Bruce in May. He then narrowed down the possible manner ofBruce’s death to seven categories and informed the jurors to choose from them:murder, manslaughter, justifiable homicide, suicide, natural causes, accidentaldeath, and unknown.The first witness to take the stand was Bruce’s older brother, Peter Lee. “Thelast occasion I saw him was in April 1973 when he came to my house,” Peter said,and then added as if to rule out the possibility that Bruce was drug-addled orsuicidal, “He was behaving perfectly normal on that occasion.”The only lawyer to question Peter was the insurance company’s representative,Mr. David Yapp. “Did you know that your brother was in the habit of takingcannabis?”“No, not that I know of,” Peter claimed.The second witness was Raymond Chow. He stuck to his revised version of events.He went to Bruce’s home at 3 p.m. for a two-hour script meeting. Then they wenttogether to Betty Ting Pei’s apartment at 5 p.m. for a two-and-a-half-hourbusiness meeting to offer her a role in Game of Death. At 7:30 p.m., Brucecomplained of a headache and Betty gave him one of her Equagesic pills. Feelingunwell, Bruce said he wanted to lie down. Raymond left alone to have dinner withGeorge Lazenby. After several calls between Raymond and Betty, Raymond went overto the apartment and found Bruce looking like he was peacefully asleep. “I andMiss Ting shook him but still could not wake him up,” he told the court. Theycalled her personal physician, Dr. Eugene Chu Poh-hwye. When he couldn’t reviveBruce, an ambulance was summoned and Bruce was delivered to Queen ElizabethHospital where he was declared dead at 11:30 p.m. Raymond concluded by saying,“I saw him almost every day. There was nothing unusual about his behavior. Hewas not depressed. I don’t think that he had any domestic problems.”After the lunch break, the most famous mistress in Hong Kong took the stand. Thealready intense atmosphere in the courtroom rose to an even higher pitch as thecrowd pointed and whispered. Betty Ting Pei’s testimony, delivered in a haltingand uncertain voice, supported Raymond’s. She maintained the fiction that it waspurely a business meeting and she and Bruce were merely industry acquaintances.“The last occasion I saw Bruce Lee prior to the 20th July 1973 was about a monthbefore that date,” she insisted, despite quotes in the press from her neighborssaying Bruce was a frequent visitor to her apartment.The doctor who examined Bruce at Betty’s apartment, Dr. Eugene Chu, was the nextto testify. He was questioned by the insurance lawyer. “Did anybody explain toyou what was supposed to be wrong with the deceased when you saw Bruce Lee?”asked David Yapp.“I was told that Bruce Lee developed a headache, had been given some tablet forthe headache and he took that. He also had a nap. Subsequently, they tried towake him up but they could not rouse him.”“Did you ascertain what sort of tablet was give to Bruce Lee?”“On the tin foil pack was the word Equagesic. It is a mild tranquilizer withanalgesic effect. It is stronger than an aspirin. Taking one such tablet usuallyis quite harmless unless the patient is hypersensitive to it.”Despite weeks of wild and varied speculation over Bruce’s demise, this was thefirst time anyone had ever suggested hypersensitivity to Equagesic as a possiblecause of death. This theory would gain traction later in the inquest.Image [../images/sec.jpg]The crowd of reporters and onlookers around the courthouse was even bigger onthe second day. The inquest was front-page news in every newspaper, tabloid, andTV show in the colony. The press clearly intended to squeeze as much coverage asthey could before they lost their favorite subject forever.The first witness was senior paramedic Pang Tak Sun. His ambulance had receivedthe call at 10:30 p.m. and been informed it was a “person collapse case.” Alongwith a junior paramedic and the ambulance driver, they went up to thesecond-floor apartment. Inside he claimed, “There were three males, one femaleand one patient in that flat. One of the males was rather young.”His testimony caused a murmur from the press. Up to this point, the only peoplewho were reported in the apartment that night were the patient (Bruce Lee), thewoman (Betty Ting Pei), and two older men (Raymond Chow and Dr. Eugene Chu). Whowas this third man? The paramedic’s very specific memory of a younger malebecame a dramatic subplot throughout the rest of the inquest. Both Raymond Chowand Dr. Eugene Chu later denied under oath that there was another man in theroom. Was the paramedic mistaken or were Chow and Chu lying? It was catnip forconspiracy theorists—the young man in Betty Ting Pei’s apartment the equivalentof the second gunman on the grassy knoll.After this bombshell, the paramedic raised eyebrows again with his descriptionof Bruce Lee: “When I first saw the patient he had his shirt on him but I cannotremember the color. He was also wearing European style trousers. His shirt wasbuttoned but I don’t remember whether it was buttoned up to his neck. He wastidily dressed.”It was Linda Lee’s lawyer, T.S. Lo, who seized upon this detail: “When youarrived at the scene you said the patient was tidily dressed?”“Yes.”“Did he appear to be lying peacefully and no sign of struggle?” asked Lo.“That is right.”“Did he have his shoes on?”“They were boots with lifts.”Newspaper reports that Bruce’s body was found fully dressed sparked yet anotherwave of conspiratorial chatter across the colony. It was taken as proof that thescene was staged—Bruce had died somewhere else and been moved to Betty’s bed.Maybe the unidentified young man had helped transport the body.The second witness of the day was Dr. Chan Kwong Chau, the casualty ward doctorwho first treated Bruce at Queen Elizabeth Hospital. “There was no heartbeat, norespiration, both pupils were dilated and not reactive to light,” he testified.“On clinical grounds I would say the patient was dead.” Despite this fact, Dr.Chau tried to resuscitate Bruce for five to ten minutes before sending him offto the emergency ward upstairs.Dr. Chau was followed by Dr. Cheng Po Chi, the emergency ward doctor, whotestified: “Following my examination my observations were that he had no pulse,no respiration. At that juncture I thought he was dead. It was the wardprocedure that even if we thought that the patient was dead we still would makethe last efforts to revive the patient.” Dr. Cheng gave Bruce an adrenaline shotto the heart. There was no response. Bruce Lee was certified dead at 11:30 p.m.It was like a ghoulish game of hot potato. Bruce’s body had been passed from Dr.Chu at Betty’s apartment, to the ambulance paramedics, to the casualty ward, tothe emergency ward, before finally everyone had to officially admit that themost famous man in Hong Kong was actually dead.After lunch the forensic pathologist and the police detective who went toBetty’s apartment that evening testified that there was no evidence of foulplay. “I could not see any signs of a fight or struggle having taken place,”said the forensic pathologist. “I was unable to see any obvious poisoningsubstances in the flat. There was no evidence that the deceased was killed byphysical violence.”The judge announced that the next court date would be pushed back two weeks toSeptember 17. He didn’t reveal why, but the reason would end up having asignificant impact on the proceedings.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Despite the delay, interest in the case remained high. On the morning ofSeptember 17, a line of reporters and curiosity seekers stretched out of TsunWan Court starting at 6 a.m. and continued to swell in numbers until the courtopened at ten. The crowds had come to hear the mistress, Betty Ting Pei, and thewife, Linda Lee, testify on the same day.It was a fraught moment for the young widow filled with potential pitfalls. Toget the life insurance money, Linda needed to deny under oath that she had anyknowledge of Bruce’s cannabis use prior to his application for the AIA policy onFebruary 1, 1973. She further wanted to argue that cannabis was not the cause ofdeath. The insurance lawyer’s goal was to prove that Bruce had lied on hisapplication. Failing that, the insurance company wanted to establish cannabis asthe cause of death. If Bruce died of illegal drug use, they could tie up anypayout in further litigation.During the two-week intermission, Linda had dismissed her previous attorney,T.S. Lo, and replaced him with Brian Tisdall, an aggressive young lawyer whoalso happened to represent Golden Harvest. Bruce had hired him previously to sueThe China Star for libel.When the public prosecutor, Joseph Duffy, asked Linda about Bruce’s collapse onMay 10 and use of cannabis, she responded: “He was treated by Dr. Langford andDr. Peter Wu. I was present when my husband told Dr. Wu he had taken cannabis onthat day. But when he received a check-up from neurologist Dr. David Reisbord inthe United States, Dr. Reisbord said that taking a small dose of cannabis wasnot harmful and had nothing to do with his collapse.”Linda went on to testify that Bruce only took two prescription medications:Dilantin, the antiseizure drug prescribed by Dr. Reisbord, and Doloxene, a painrelief drug that combines an opioid and aspirin. “He only used Doloxene when hisback was bothering him. He did not suffer any ill effects when he took it,” shesaid. “His health between the time he collapsed in May and his death appeared tobe good except he was more tired. He attributed his collapse in May to overworkand exhaustion.”At the end of her testimony, Linda submitted into evidence a letter from Dr.Reisbord, who had reviewed the autopsy report at Linda’s request. Reisbordconcluded: “No definite cause of death can be established. It would appear to behighly unlikely that the traces of cannibinoids found in the patient’s stomachcontributed to his demise. There have not been any reliable reports of humanfatalities attributable to marijuana.”The insurance lawyer, David Yapp, tried to get Linda to admit that Bruce usedcannabis prior to his life insurance application on February 1, 1973. “You cameto live in Hong Kong in February of 1972?”“Yes.”“Before you came to Hong Kong in February 1972 were you aware that your husbandtook cannabis occasionally?”Linda’s attorney, Brian Tisdall, jumped to his feet. “Objection! Leadingquestion.”The insurance lawyer whirled on Tisdall: “Please don’t interrupt my questionsfor the witness.”The two attorneys continued to bicker until Judge Tung intervened: “I will allowthis line of questioning, but the witness is free to refuse to answer anypotentially misleading questions. Do you wish to answer, Mrs. Lee?”She nodded and then asserted, “I was not aware.”“The knowledge that he took cannabis occasionally was known to you only afteryou came to Hong Kong?” the insurance lawyer asked.“Yes.”“At what point did you learn that he used cannabis?”Once again, Tisdall objected to this line of questioning, and, after anotherheated argument between the two lawyers, the judge delivered his decision:“Though the witness has a right not to answer questions which may tend toincriminate herself, because these questions are not of that nature, she mustanswer truthfully.”“On March or April 1973,” Linda claimed, selecting a month right after the lifeinsurance application was submitted, “I was first aware that he took cannabisoccasionally. In fact it was on that occasion that he told me he started takingcannabis.”As soon as Linda finished her testimony, reporters rushed out of the courthouseto file their articles for the afternoon newspapers. The China Mail’s front-pageheadline trumpeted: “Bruce Took Cannabis—Linda.”Raymond Chow was re-called to the stand. The first lawyer to question him wasBrian Tisdall, who was officially serving as Linda’s attorney but in reality wasGolden Harvest’s mouthpiece. Suggesting to Linda that she hire Tisdall as herlawyer was a brilliant maneuver on Raymond’s part, as it allowed the two men,without appearing to be colluding, to present to the court and public analternate theory of the case.“You agree that all Bruce’s films involved a great deal of physical activity anda lot of fighting?”  Tisdall asked, laying the groundwork.“Yes.”“During the making of the films were you aware that Mr. Lee might receive blowswhich he didn’t mean to receive, and that these blows could be quite severe?”“From time to time.”“During the making of the last completed film, Enter the Dragon, did he receivesuch blows?”  Tisdall asked, plugging Golden Harvest’s upcoming Bruce Lee movie.“Several times,” Raymond answered without hesitating.“When would that be?”“February or March 1973 at least three or four times,” Raymond replied. “Oncewas in the face accidentally by another actor with his fist. He was hurt verymuch on that occasion. He had to go back to my office to rest for about one hourbefore he could continue his work.”“During your career as a producer have you heard much about karate and otherforms of martial arts?”“Yes.”“Have you ever heard that people might receive a blow and that the effect wasnot discovered until quite some time later?”“Yes, I have heard of that.”All in all, it was an ingenious pre-rehearsed set piece. Since Bruce’s death,the press had been busy disfiguring his public image as a martial arts superheroby castigating him as a drug-addicted sex maniac—a Chinese Charlie Sheen. Theinquest’s inquiry into cannabis as the cause of death was only furthersolidifying this negative perception in the public mind. By floating braindamage from a concussion sustained while filming a dangerous fight scene, Chowwas inventing a heroic death. Linda had a life insurance policy she needed tosecure; Raymond had a movie he needed to sell.The insurance lawyer, David Yapp, was not duped by Chow’s attempt to divertattention from drugs. After Tisdall sat down, Yapp immediately turned thequestioning back to cannabis.“You agree that Bruce Lee formed a very important part of your company’sactivities?”“Yes.”“Did you take a great interest in his activities and welfare?”“Yes.”“Presumably when he collapsed in May 1973 you were very interested to find outwhy he collapsed?”“Yes.”“Were you ever informed that before he had collapsed he had taken somecannabis?”“No.”“When did you first hear that Bruce took cannabis?”“In this court on 3rd September 1973,” Raymond said with a straight face.Annoyed that Chow was refusing to cooperate (everyone who knew Bruce Lee knew heenjoyed marijuana and hash), the insurance lawyer attacked Raymond’scredibility. “Did you make a statement in public about the place where thedeceased was found collapsed which was quite different from what you told us inthis inquest?” David Yapp asked, referring to Golden Harvest’s initial pressrelease that falsely claimed Bruce had collapsed at home while walking in hisgarden with his wife.“I did not make any statement about that aspect to the press.”At this bald-faced lie, loud boos rained down from the reporters packed into thecourthouse. Chow had fooled them once; they were not going to sit silently whilehe attempted it again. There was such an uproar the judge had to call forsilence before turning to Chow to ask the same question again: “Did you releaseany public statement?”Raymond carefully dodged the magistrate’s query: “Within one hour or so afterthe deceased was pronounced dead, I made a statement to the police of all thefacts. The statement to the police was the same as the evidence I have given inthis court.”Dr. Eugene Chu was the witness who had to follow Raymond’s tough act. He triedto explain why he sent Bruce to Queen Elizabeth Hospital instead of the nearerhospital, Baptist, where he also happened to work. “I sent him to Q.E.H. notbecause I thought he was dead but because I believed the facilities were betterat Q.E.H. When I saw Bruce Lee in the bed, he had no pulse, no heartbeat and norespiration.”This bizarre assertion was quickly vivisected by Linda’s attorney, BrianTisdall. “If he had no pulse, no heartbeat and no respiration, would thesuperior facilities at Q.E.H. be of any importance?”“I thought it would be better to send him to Q.E.H. to try to revive him eventhough he appeared to be hopeless,” Dr. Chu claimed.“Did you think there was a hope to revive him?”“Not much.”That was the end of Dr. Eugene Chu’s humiliating ordeal. When he died forty-twoyears later, his obituary in the South China Morning Post noted, “Dr. Chu neverspoke another word about the night of July 20, 1973, when Lee breathed hislast.”Once Dr. Chu stepped down, the crowd in the courtroom gallery began buzzing. Thenext witness scheduled to take the stand was Betty Ting Pei, who had beenwaiting in court all day. Much to everyone’s surprise the public prosecutor,Joseph Duffy, rose to his feet and said, “The crown counsel does not require thepresence of Miss Betty Ting Pei to give any more evidence.”  The magistrateagreed and Betty was dismissed.Audible gasps erupted from the onlookers and grumbles from the reporters. Bettywas the star witness and headline news. For those who were suspicious that theinquest was a sham, this was further evidence. If the government really wantedto know why Bruce Lee died, why wouldn’t they re-call the last person to see himalive? There were plenty of questions that needed answers and contradictorytestimony that needed untangling. Did Bruce and Raymond really arrive at herapartment together? Did Bruce consume cannabis while at her apartment? Whywasn’t an ambulance called earlier? Why was Bruce fully dressed when theparamedics arrived? Was there a mysterious young man in the apartment? Didanyone attempt to move the body prior to the arrival of the paramedics? Why didDr. Chu insist on sending him to Queen Elizabeth instead of Baptist Hospital?Instead of asking any of these questions, the public prosecutor and the judgejust let Betty Ting Pei walk away.Image [../images/sec.jpg]The next day was devoted to the testimony and questioning of one witness: thegovernment’s chemist, Dr. Lam King Leung. For six hours, he went into extendedand excruciating detail over every single test that was completed for theautopsy. According to Dr. Leung’s report, blood tests proved that Bruce hadtaken one pill of Equagesic and a small amount of cannabis. Neither was in anamount sufficient for an overdose. Further tests for every type of poison anddrug known to mankind—including mercury, arsenic, bismuth, antimony, lead,alcohol, morphine, and Spanish Fly—were negative. Bruce didn’t overdose, and hewasn’t poisoned.If one strategic goal of the coroner’s inquest was to bore the public intosubmission, the plan worked. By the end of the day, the atmosphere in Tsun WanCourt had calmed significantly and the pack of reporters waiting outside thecourthouse had thinned out dramatically.Image [../images/sec.jpg]To quell the unrest over Bruce’s death, the government needed a sociallyacceptable explanation. The problem was the medical experts didn’t agree. TheHong Kong–based doctors—Dr. Donald Langford (the American doctor who had treatedBruce on May 10), Dr. Peter Wu (the Chinese neurologist who saved Bruce’s lifeon May 10), and Dr. R. R. Lycette (the coroner from New Zealand)—all believedcannabis was the cause of Bruce Lee’s death. On the American side, however, Dr.David Reisbord, the UCLA neurologist who had examined Lee after his May 10collapse, correctly pointed out that there had never been a substantiated caseof death from cannabis. Based on the available evidence, Dr. Reisbord believedthe cause of death was unknown and unknowable.The government’s solution was to bring in a world-famous pathologist fromLondon, Professor Robert Donald Teare. His busy schedule was the reason theinquest had been delayed for two weeks. Teare was a professor of forensicmedicine at the University of London and a guest lecturer at the MetropolitanPolice (Scotland Yard) training college. Bruce Lee’s case was perfect for thelimelight-seeking professor, who gravitated toward high-profile celebritydeaths. He had also supervised the autopsies and testified at the coronerinquests of Jimi Hendrix (1970) and Brian Epstein (1967), the manager of theBeatles. He was billed to the Hong Kong press and public as a real-life SherlockHolmes.After reviewing the coroner’s findings and studying the evidence, Teareprivately called in the other expert witnesses for a come-to-Jesus meeting.“Professor Teare, Dr. Wu, Dr. Lycette, and myself, we met on one of the upperfloors of Queen Elizabeth,” recalls Dr. Langford. “It was not exactly a dressrehearsal for the trial, but it was a chance for him to caution us about howHong Kong was really on the spot and how we were not considered to be a worldforensic pathology center, that there had been no studies authenticating thepossibility of a death from cannabis—and that we must not do anything to put thelocal medical community on the spot. If one was going to decide that thechemicals in marijuana were dangerous and could be lethal, then that conclusionshouldn’t be decided in some little bitty, insignificant backwater like HongKong. We were not asked to perjure ourselves, but we were cautioned that thewhole world would be watching. At the time I viewed this as tampering with thewitnesses.”Having read the testimony and looked at the evidence, Professor Teare haddeveloped an alternative hypothesis as to the cause of death—one that had beenmentioned in passing once during the inquest by Dr. Chu but never brought upagain—hypersensitivity to Equagesic. Professor Teare sought to sway the threedoctors to his theory. He failed with the American and the Chinese doctors butsucceeded with the New Zealand coroner.Image [../images/sec.jpg]After the tedious chemistry testimony of the previous day, the crowds had mostlydeparted. By the morning of the fifth day, the courtroom was relatively cold andempty. The first witness was Linda Lee. She returned to the stand to submit intoevidence a report from Dr. Ira Frank from UCLA entitled “Clinical Studies inCannabis.” Dr. Frank’s conclusion was the same as Dr. Reisbord’s—there were nosubstantiated cases of cannabis as a cause of death. The trace amounts ofcannabis found in Bruce’s Lee’s stomach were irrelevant to his demise.The only question for Linda came from one of the jurors: “Was the reason yousought out this report from the doctors in Los Angeles because of theinsurance?”“No,” she averred, “it was because I want to clarify the real reason for myhusband’s death.”Next up was Dr. Langford, who hesitantly proposed cannabis as the cause of BruceLee’s first collapse on May 10. “At the time in my mind, I felt that there was apossibility his condition was due to drug ingestion,” he said, beforeimmediately qualifying his theory. “It may or may not have been drugintoxication.”Dr. Langford’s decision to hedge on cannabis was partly due to the warningdelivered by Professor Teare. But he was also influenced by his friendship withBruce and Linda. The two families were neighbors, and Linda and Dr. Langfordwere in the same Cantonese class. He knew the life insurance company was tryingto nullify Bruce’s policy because of cannabis. “I had considerable sympathy forLinda wanting to get the money she felt was rightfully hers to raise thosekids,” Dr. Langford later explained.In contrast, Dr. Peter Wu, the Chinese neurologist, didn’t know the Lee familypersonally, and he certainly wasn’t going to back down because some Britishprofessor had tried to big-foot him. Dr. Chu’s clinical diagnosis was “cerebraledema and poisoning by cannabis suspected.”Brian Tisdall, Linda and Golden Harvest’s attorney, aggressively attacked Dr.Wu’s assertion that cannabis was the cause of death. “Do you have any personalexperience with cannabis?”  Tisdall asked.“No, not at all.”“Had any cases involving cannabis?”“No.”“From your theoretical knowledge would you say that cannabis is a potentialkiller by itself?”“It could be by itself.”“In what circumstances?”“If it was used excessively or if a person has a hypersensitivity towards it.”“In saying that what information or reading material are you relying upon?”“In the pharmacological text books. My knowledge was mainly derived from textbooks from my student days.” Dr. Wu hesitated before conceding, “I am not in theposition as an expert to talk about cannabis.”Tisdall had no further questions for Dr. Peter Wu. None of the other attorneyschose to cross-examine him, not even the insurance lawyer. The destruction ofhis credibility was too complete. He was dismissed.After a lunch break, Dr. R. R. Lycette, the coroner from New Zealand, took thestand. He summarized his autopsy report. There were no signs of external injuryor needle marks. The only thing abnormal was the swelling of Bruce’s brain. Hisconclusion was “edema of the brain (i.e. excess fluid accumulation) was theimmediate cause of death.” Because he could not find any natural causes for theedema, he briefly flirted with the cannabis theory. “But when I learned thatthere were no authenticated cases of deaths from cannabis,” he said, “I came tothe conclusion that [Lee’s] death was not due to cannabis intoxication.”Having excluded cannabis and any other type of poison, Dr. R. R. Lycette wasleft to deduce: “Bruce Lee died from some form of hypersensitivity. I feel themost likely substance was one of the components of Equagesic.” Dr. Lycette didnot mention Professor Teare or the fact that he was parroting Teare’s theory.“Fatal aspirin hypersensitivity has been ascribed to having swallowed just onetablet, but it is very rare.”He finished by saying that he considered Bruce’s two collapses on May 10 andJuly 20 to be linked. “I think the May episode was consistent with a non-fatalattack of the same illness which killed Mr. Lee in July.” Dr. Lycettehypothesized that Bruce may have taken the pain medication Doloxene, which alsocontains aspirin, prior to his collapse on May 10.Image [../images/sec.jpg]The previous day’s testimony by the coroner, Dr. Lycette, had firmly set up thehypersensitivity to Equagesic theory. On day six, it was left to the finalwitness to drive it home—Professor Teare. As with all the other experts,Professor Teare began with his credentials: “I have specialized in forensicmedicine for the last 35 years. During that time I have performed about 90,000post-mortems and given evidence in 18,000 inquests.”  Those were incrediblenumbers, which the Hong Kong newspapers reported as fact without doing the math.To achieve what he claimed, Professor Teare would have had to perform 7autopsies and testify in 1.5 inquests every day, seven days a week, 365 days ayear for 35 years.Hong Kong officials wanted a palatable explanation to hand to the public, andProfessor Teare, who was not prone to caution, humility, or self-doubt, did notdisappoint. Teare agreed with the coroner’s assessment that Bruce’s death fromcerebral edema on July 20 was linked to his collapse on May 10. He alsoconcurred that, “There was no ordinary natural disease in this case.” He thenproceeded to eliminate cannabis as the suspect with a flourish: “I have nevercome across any case of allergic or hypersensitivities to cannabis. In myopinion the fact that cannabis was taken shortly before the onset of his illnessin May and cannabis was also found in his stomach on 20th July 73 was a purecoincidence. So far as acute cerebral edema is concerned taking cannabis ortaking a cup of tea or coffee would be identical.”Having discarded cannabis, he turned to the two drugs in Equagesic, aspirin andmeprobamate. Professor Teare argued: “In my opinion the cause of death was acutecerebral edema due to hypersensitivity to either meprobamate or aspirin orpossibly the combination of the two.” He concluded, “This sort ofhypersensitivity is very rare indeed.”With that, the final witness of the inquest was dismissed. Judge Elbert Tungmade a special point of thanking Professor Teare for traveling from so far awayto testify. The court was adjourned until the following Monday morning when thejury would begin deliberations.Image [../images/sec.jpg]On the seventh day of the inquest, Judge Tung laid out his instructions to thethree-man jury: “The key witnesses in this case are the medical and forensicexperts, such as Doctors Lycette [coroner] and Lam [chemist], as well asProfessor R. D. Teare,” the judge said, before emphasizing, “who traveled a longway to be here.” He did not mention Dr. Langford or Dr. Peter Wu, the twomedical experts who supported the cannabis theory.The judge then explained the seven possible choices for cause of death, as onewould expect, but then he added, in what reads like an example of leading thejury, his own opinions as to which choices were credible and which were not:1. Murder: Intentionally and maliciously causing the death of another. Sincethere is no evidence to support this in this case, we may rule it out.2. Manslaughter: Causing the death of a person without intent to harm. Since thedeath clearly was not a direct result of anyone else’s actions, we may rule itout.3. Justifiable Homicide: Unrelated to the current case, and therefore not underconsideration.4. Suicide: All the evidence points to the idea that Bruce Lee had no motivationor tendency to harm or kill himself, and there is nothing else, such as a will,to indicate that he intended to die. Therefore, the probability of this isextremely low.5. Death by Natural Causes: Though Doctors Lycette and Lam performed exhaustivetesting on the body of Bruce Lee, they could find no evidence of a naturaldisease or disorder that might lead to the death of Bruce Lee. My opinion isthat “natural causes” should be excluded from consideration, in accordance withthe opinion of the three medical experts who testified.6. Accidental Death: According to legal definitions, there is not a clear linedrawn between “accidental death,” “death by misadventure,” and “death bydisaster.” In my view, “death by misadventure” involves a greater degree of “badluck” than does “accidental death.”Perhaps worried that the jury wouldn’t get the message he was delivering, thejudge went on:Given that the body of Bruce Lee showed no outward signs of injury, and that thepolice found no signs of a struggle or traces of poison at the apartment, and inview of the testimony of three medical experts stating that Bruce’s death wascaused by cerebral edema, a verdict of “accidental death” is worth considering.In fact, the opinion of medical expert, Professor Teare, is that cannabis couldnot have led to the death of Bruce Lee, either by chronic or acute poisoning.Dr. Lycette further notes that certain drugs or combinations of drugs cansometimes lead to fatal allergic reactions, and that there are cases of allergicreaction to aspirin. Though aspirin only makes up one-half of the content of“Equagesic,” it is quite possible that the combined action of the aspirin andmeprobamate in Equagesic caused the allergic reaction.Of course, cases of this sort of reaction are also extremely rare; therefore, ifthe jury accepts the judgment of Professor Teare, the causes of death would beclassified as either “accidental death” or “death by misadventure.” If themembers of the jury still have doubts about the testimony and analysispresented, then they should choose the seventh option: “cause of death unknown.”After being more or less told how to decide the case, the three-man jury didn’thave any doubts. It took them less than five minutes of deliberation to reach averdict: “Death by Misadventure.”  The longest coroner’s inquest in the colony’shistory was concluded with its shortest jury deliberation. The swiftness of theverdict was so surprising many of the reporters were caught off-guard. They hadgone outside for a smoke break. At 11:15 a.m. on September 24, 1973, Judge Tungaccepted the verdict and announced that the inquest into the death of Bruce Leewas officially closed.Image [../images/sec.jpg]For the public, it remained open. Many fans were reminded of the opening sceneof Fist of Fury where Lee falls grief-stricken on the coffin of his dead kung fumaster. “Would you tell me what teacher died of?” Bruce’s character asksbitterly in that scene.“It was pneumonia,” a fellow student replies.“And you believe that?”The grief-stricken Chinese public could not accept that their invincible hero, athirty-two-year-old man at the height of his physical powers, had died from anaspirin. While the inquest had achieved the government’s goal of quelling themore extreme outbursts (there were no more protests or bomb threats), Bruce’sdeath remained a hot topic of debate. The jury had ruled on the manner ofdeath—Misadventure—but not the cause. On that subject, Bruce’s fans, who readthe inquest transcripts published every day in the papers, could see that theexperts were bitterly divided. The judge, coroner, and famous pathologist hadargued for hypersensitivity to aspirin. Two of Bruce’s Hong Kong doctorsbelieved it was cannabis. And his American neurologist was convinced the causewas still unknown. Given the conflicting expert opinions, new theories andspeculation were published in magazines and newspapers. When Linda Lee and BettyTing Pei showed up together at a test screening of Enter the Dragon, it onlyadded grist to the rumor mill, even causing some to suspect a murder plot.To this day, there is no consensus on the cause of Bruce Lee’s death. “Without adoubt, the most widely asked question which has been addressed to me over theyears has been ‘How did Bruce Lee die?’ ” says Linda Lee.Image [../images/sec.jpg]On July 20, 1973, Bruce Lee died from heat stroke. It is the most plausiblescientific theory for his death. Consider the timeline.Ten weeks earlier on May 10, 1973, Bruce Lee collapsed after working in aboiling hot room. He displayed multiple symptoms of central nervous systemdysfunction (nausea, vomiting, staggering, collapse), and his temperature wasdangerously elevated—the two diagnostic criteria for hyperthermia. Bruce had along history of being vulnerable to heat. His risk factor was increased by sleepdeprivation, extreme weight loss, and the recent surgical removal of his armpitsweat glands.July 20, 1973, was the hottest day of the month in tropical Hong Kong. In BettyTing Pei’s small apartment, Bruce demonstrated scene after kung fu scene fromGame of Death. “In telling the story, he acted out the whole thing,” RaymondChow says. “So, that probably made him a little tired and thirsty. After a fewsips he seemed to be a little dizzy.” Just like on May 10, Bruce exerted himselfin a hot enclosed space and ended up feeling faint and suffering from aheadache—two early signs of heat stroke. He wandered into Betty’s bedroom, fellonto her bed, and never got up again. “A person who has suffered one heat strokeis at increased risk for another,” says Dr. Lisa Leon, an expert in hyperthermiaat the U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine. “Patientsexperience multi-organ dysfunction during the hours, days, and weeks ofrecovery, which increases risk for long-term disability and death.”Of the minor drugs in Bruce’s stomach on July 20, neither cannabis normeprobamate is known to cause cerebral edema. The only possible suspect isaspirin. The Mayo Clinic lists the potential reactions to aspirin as “hives,itchy skin, runny nose, red eyes, swelling of lips, tongue or face, coughing,wheezing, shortness of breath, and anaphylaxis—a rare, life-threatening allergicreaction.” More commonly caused by bee stings and peanut allergies, anaphylaxiscan result in fatal cerebral edema. When Professor Teare and Dr. Lycette weretheorizing about hypersensitivity to aspirin, they were talking aboutanaphylactic shock.But anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction, is almost always accompanied byother symptoms—an enflamed trachea, neck, tongue, and lips, as well as hives andred itchy skin in and around the mouth. In fatal cases, the swelling of thethroat blocks the airway resulting in asphyxia and cerebral edema. Theparamedics and doctors who treated Bruce the night of July 20 did not find anyinflammation of Bruce’s tongue or throat. Nor did the coroner, Dr. Lycette,during the autopsy. Bruce Lee was a hard-core martial artist who took aspirinfor pain most of his adult life. While it is possible he suddenly developed alife-threatening allergy to aspirin at the age of thirty-two, the odds that hedied from anaphylactic shock without any of the associated symptoms arevanishingly small.Compared to aspirin allergies, heat stroke is a far more common killer of youngathletic men. It is the third most common cause of sudden death in sportsactivities and rises to first during the hottest months of summer. In the UnitedStates alone, an average of three high school and college football players dieevery year of heat stroke. Korey Stringer, a twenty-seven-year-old professionalfootball player, collapsed on a Minnesota Vikings practice field on a swelteringJuly afternoon in 2001. His death prompted immediate changes regarding heatstroke prevention throughout the NFL. There was even less awareness ofhyperthermia’s dangers in 1973 than 2001. Even now proper treatment is not knownby every physician.While it is impossible to know for certain what caused Lee’s death, hyperthermiais the most likely explanation. If it was heat stroke, then Bruce Lee died doingwhat he loved most—performing kung fu in front of an appreciative audience.From the moment he was cast in his first movie as a two-month-old, Bruce Leespent his time on this earth entertaining and educating others. With anintensity rarely seen before or since, Never Sits Still squeezed an entirelifetime’s worth of accomplishments into thirty-two short years. His death wasnot a tragedy, because his life was a triumph. “Even though I, Bruce Lee, maydie someday without fulfilling all of my ambitions, I feel no sorrow,” he told aHong Kong reporter in 1972 as if anticipating his own eulogy. “I did what Iwanted to do. What I’ve done, I’ve done with sincerity and to the best of myability. You can’t expect much more from life.”"},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f0476-01.jpg]A contestant in the Bruce Lee Talent Search at Burbank Studios, California,circa 1978.

(Kyodo News/Getty Images)"},{"pageContent":"EPILOGUETHE LEGENDIn August 1973, two teams of Chinese lion dancers paraded down HollywoodBoulevard toward Grauman’s Chinese Theatre for the Los Angeles premiere of Enterthe Dragon. A raucous crowd, which had begun to form the night before, wrappedaround the block. “Riding in the back of the limousine, I saw lines and lines ofpeople, and the lines didn’t end,” remembers John Saxon, who played Roper. “Iasked my driver, ‘What’s going on?’ and he said, ‘That’s your movie.’ ”Saxon wasn’t the only one sucker-punched by Enter the Dragon’s success. Even NewYork critics, who wrung their hands at the film’s violence, sensed its power.The New York Times declared, “The picture is expertly made and well meshed; itmoves like lightning and brims with color. It is also the most savagelymurderous and numbing hand-hacker (not a gun in it) you will ever see anywhere.”In The Village Voice, William Paul confessed, “In my most civilizedright-thinking frame of mind, I’d like to dismiss the film as abhorrentlygrotesque masculine fantasy, but I have to admit that deep down in the mostshadowy recesses of my subconscious the fantasy struck a responsive chord.”Enter the Dragon struck a responsive chord across the globe. Made for aminuscule $850,000, it would gross $90 million worldwide in 1973 and go on toearn an estimated $350 million over the next forty-five years. Fred Weintraubjoked that the movie was so profitable the studio even had to pay him. MichaelAllin recalls, “Warner’s lawyer sent me a letter saying, ‘The picture will bewell into profit’—and here’s the phrase I love—‘by anybody’s formula.’ Thepicture made so much money they could not sweep it under the rug. The rug hadtoo big a bulge.”Released less than a month after Lee’s two funerals, Enter the Dragon made himin death what he stated as his “Definite Chief Aim” in life—the first andhighest-paid Oriental superstar in the United States. It also made him biggerthan Steve McQueen. While filming Enter the Dragon, Lee told Weintraub his goalwas for their film to be more successful than McQueen’s The Getaway, then alsoin production. “If I could send Bruce a telegram in heaven,” said Weintraub, “itwould read Dragon outgrossed Getaway everywhere.”While the TV series Kung Fu and Shaw Brothers’ Five Fingers of Death, releasedon March 21, 1973, cracked open the door, it was Lee’s performance in Enter theDragon that blew it off its hinges—launching an entirely new genre of film inthe West. Cheaply made Hong Kong kung fu flicks, what Variety would call“chopsocky,” became a cultural phenomenon, breaking out of the urban grindhousesinto suburban multiplexes. “Everybody was kung fu fighting,” sang one-hitwonderboy Carl Douglas, “Those cats were fast as lightning.” His 1974 song “KungFu Fighting” sold eleven million copies. In New York City, there were as many asthirty different Hong Kong flicks playing at one time.All of Bruce’s previous Golden Harvest movies—The Big Boss, Fist of Fury, andWay of the Dragon—received wide releases and grossed nearly $50 million. Threeepisodes of The Green Hornet were stitched together, prefaced with footage fromLee’s screen test, and released as a theatrical movie in November 1974. “Mr.Lee, who played Kato, the kung fu artist and faithful houseboy to the GreenHornet (Van Williams), gets star billing now as the result of the hugepopularity of the kung fu films he made in Hong Kong before his death lastyear,” wrote Vincent Canby in The New York Times.Since Bruce died before he became internationally famous, fans were ravenous fordetails about his life. “I knew so little about him and wanted to know so much,”wrote a young woman from New Jersey to Black Belt magazine. “Suddenly, he isdead, and I just can’t accept it. It’s as if I knew him, and now I never will.”Hundreds of fan magazines were published with fictionalized accounts of hisheroic deeds. More than a half dozen memorial albums and quickie biographieswere cranked out. There was even a tacky biopic, The Dragon Dies Hard (1975),which asserted that Lee got his martial arts start when some hoods tried tomuscle in on his Washington Post newspaper delivery route.An entire posthumous industry was born in 1973, complete withmerchandising—pendants, action figures, T-shirts, sweatshirts, and posters ofBruce Lee to place on dorm room walls next to Che Guevara. Martial artsmagazines, like Black Belt and Fighting Stars, once small-scale newssheets,became glossy publications, complete with mail-order advertisements for anythingfrom a $132 stainless steel tri-fork to a $5.95 Bruce Lee Punching Puppet. EvenRobert Lee attempted to cash in with a folk album dedicated to his brother, TheBallad of Bruce Lee. “Not since James Dean died in the crash of his silver-greyPorsche,” wrote Kenneth Turan, the movie critic for the Los Angeles Times, “hasany Hollywood star received this kind of send-off to Valhalla.”Bruce Lee became the Patron Saint of Kung Fu, worshipped like a demigod.Japanese teenagers cut their hair like his. The Taiwanese called him “The Manwith the Golden Singing Legs,” the British “The King of Kung Fu,” and theAustralians “The Fastest Fists in the East.” Elvis Presley watched Enter theDragon dozens of times and began production on his own self-financed martialarts film, which he never completed. The title of a top disco song in India was“Here’s to That Swell Guy, Bruce Lee.” For the rest of the decade, Enter theDragon was repeatedly rereleased and each time it landed among the fivetop-grossing pictures of the week. A theater in Iran played the film daily untilthe government was overthrown in 1979. VHS tapes of Enter the Dragon weresmuggled into Eastern Europe in the 1980s, turning Bruce Lee into a symbol ofresistance to Communism.With missionary zeal, Bruce had set out to use the medium of movies to promotethe martial arts. He succeeded beyond his wildest expectations. Before Lee’sdeath, there were fewer than five hundred martial arts schools in the world; bythe late 1990s, because of his influence, there were more than twenty millionmartial arts students in the United States alone. In Britain, there was so muchdemand that crowds four-abreast would line up in the street outside the handfulof commercial schools and literally throw money at the teacher to ensure a placein the next session. “Bruce Lee was, and always will be, the main reason why Imust strive to reach perfection in the martial arts in my years to come,” wrotea boy from South Carolina to Black Belt magazine.Image [../images/sec.jpg]While the rest of the world was falling in love with the late Bruce Lee, HongKong was experiencing a hangover. Lee had risen to superstardom in the colony asthe defender of the Chinese people, their hero. His sudden death, mired inscandal, left them bereft and disturbed. “A lot of people still loved him,” saysW. Wong, the president of the Bruce Lee Fan Club, “but because his death wasless than glorious, many felt deceived and betrayed. They felt empty because ofthe loss of an icon.”This disillusionment was reflected in disappointing box office numbers for Enterthe Dragon in Hong Kong. It earned HK$3 million—the same as The Big Boss but twomillion less than Way of the Dragon. Even in death Bruce was still the biggestbox office draw in the colony, but his fame had crested and was falling. “He’salready dead,” said one Chinese fan. “What’s the point?”For Hong Kong filmmakers, the point was Bruce Lee’s golden punch had smashed thebarrier to international markets. Prior to Bruce, Hong Kong’s movie industry wasthe equivalent of Nigeria’s today, a profitable but parochial backyard business.“After Bruce Lee, we had a great opportunity to draw attention, especially fromHollywood,” says John Woo, director of Face/Off (1997) and Mission: Impossible 2(2000). “He opened the door. People around the world really started to payattention to Chinese action movies, and the talent.”Bruce saved Golden Harvest and shattered Shaw’s monopoly. “Run Run had deeppockets and owned the theaters. His strategy was to strangle Golden Harvest andbleed us to death with lawsuits,” says Andre Morgan. “Bruce broke us intointernational markets with kung fu. It was unheard of. We could finally sell toEurope, South America, North America, and the Middle East. Raymond Chow had apipeline of money coming in. Because we had done Enter the Dragon, other peoplewere interested in doing co-productions.”Immediately, the search began for the next Bruce Lee. Anyone associated with himwas signed to a movie contract and thrust in front of the cameras. Chuck Norriswas the white Bruce Lee, Sammo Hung the chubby Bruce Lee, and Jackie Chan thefunny Bruce Lee. None of them could topple Lee as a box office champion andinternational icon. Jackie Chan tried and failed to make it in America with TheBig Brawl (1980), directed by Robert Clouse and co-produced by Raymond Chow andFred Weintraub. It wasn’t until twenty-five years after Enter the Dragon thatJackie finally became Hong Kong’s second crossover star with Rush Hour (1998).Shady independent Hong Kong producers who couldn’t afford Norris, Chan, or Hungsought to cash in on the Lee phenomenon by hiring Bruce Lee look-alike actors(Lee-alikes) and changing their names to trick audiences: Bruce Li, Bruce Le,Bruce Lai, Bruce Liang, Bruce Thai, and Bronson Lee. These Bruceploitation filmsinitially ripped off the titles and plots from his original films—Return ofFists of Fury, Re-Enter the Dragon, Enter Another Dragon. By the late 1970s,they gradually became their own genre, turning Bruce into a comic book superheroin flicks like The Dragon Lives Again (where Lee descends into Hell to fightJames Bond and Dracula) and Clones of Bruce Lee (where Bruce Le, Bruce Lai,Dragon Lee, and Bruce Thai play four Bruce Lee clones saving the world from anarmy of invincible bronze men).The best of the Bruceploitation genre turned out to be Game of Death (1978).Raymond Chow claims he never wanted to use the pagoda scenes Bruce had filmed in1972 as part of a full-length movie, but distributors across the world beggedhim. Robert Clouse was hired to direct. Two Lee-alikes were cast—the ActingBruce Lee and the Action Bruce Lee. Since Bruce never finished the script, astory was cobbled together like a jigsaw puzzle working backward from thefinished scenes. The resulting creaky plot revolved around Billy Lo, a stuntmanwho refuses to sign a talent contract with the shadowy “syndicate.” After theyshoot him in the face and leave him for dead, he gets reconstructive surgery,fakes his demise, and takes revenge from beyond the grave. Raymond includedfootage from Lee’s actual Hong Kong funeral in 1973. It’s an uncomfortable messuntil the final act switches to Lee’s original footage with Dan Inosanto andKareem Abdul-Jabbar. Suddenly, the movie is magic and a reminder why no one canever replace Bruce Lee.Fans across the globe ate it up. “The Rio opening was huge, one of the biggestthey’ve ever had,” Andre Morgan told reporters. “It’s breaking records in SaoPaolo. Business is very, very good in Germany, and it was the number-fivegrosser in Japan last year, earning $8 million.” Linda Lee had originallyobjected to using the word “Death” in the title but eventually embraced themovie. At the Los Angeles premiere held at the Paramount Theatre on June 7,1979, she attended with fourteen-year-old Brandon and ten-year-old Shannon. Overa thousand loyal fans, dressed in traditional martial arts uniforms, held uptheir martial arts school banners. Mayor Tom Brady declared it Bruce Lee Day.Brandon unveiled a thirty-foot long display containing original costumes andweapons from his father’s previous film roles. Bruce Lee’s final project,however bastardized, was complete.Image [../images/sec.jpg]After Bruce’s funeral in Seattle in 1973, Linda placed her children in the careof her sister, Joan, in Calgary while she returned to Hong Kong for thecoroner’s inquest. She soon discovered that Bruce had died without having drawna will. This oversight added a complicated legal morass—an American citizendying in a British colony—on top of an emotional and financial one. When Brucepassed, he did not have much money, but he was owed a lot. It took seven yearsto probate his estate. During that time, Linda and her lawyers had to negotiatewith Raymond Chow and the life insurance companies. “My mom was going back andforth to Hong Kong quite a bit in the first year to take care of a lot ofbusiness,” says Shannon Lee.After things settled down a bit, Linda and the kids briefly stayed with hermother in Seattle. A few months at home reminded Linda of how much she missedSouthern California. With proceeds from the estate, they moved into the affluentLos Angeles suburb of Rancho Palos Verdes. For a brief period, Chuck Norrislived two streets down. Brandon often played with Norris’s two sons. Shannon andBrandon were enrolled in a private school, Rolling Hills Country Day. Linda tooknight classes in political science at California State University in Long Beachto complete her college degree. She eventually graduated and became akindergarten teacher.Her most pleasant surprise in the year following Bruce’s death was the reactionof fans to Enter the Dragon. “When he first passed away,” Linda told the LosAngeles Times, “we had no idea that he would become as legendary as he has.” Asthe posthumous Bruce Lee industry sprang to life in 1973, Linda entered into thelucrative dead celebrity business, seeking to protect his legacy and profit fromit on behalf of her children. She inked a book and movie deal with Warner Bros.Her paperback biography, Bruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew (1975), did well, butthe biopic fell apart before it began production. She signed with the ZivInternational agency to license Bruce’s image and likeness to manufacturers ofposters, T-shirts, beach towels, stationery, trophies, lamps, men’s cosmetics,karate garments, dishware, glassware, jewelry, games, and toys. Zebra Booksbecame the exclusive paperback publisher of Bruce Lee books, including BruceLee’s Basic Kung-Fu Training Manual and Bruce Lee’s My Martial Arts TrainingGuide to Jeet Kune Do. In death, Bruce had secured the financial future of hisfamily.The children lived a quiet upper-middle-class life, largely sheltered from theirfather’s fame. They didn’t study martial arts. Linda would say to them, “Don’tgo around telling people you’re Bruce Lee’s kid. Let people get to know you forwho you are first.”Shannon was more like her mother: studious, sensitive, and shy. She came intoher own in high school when she discovered musical theater. She attended TulaneUniversity in New Orleans, where she majored in music and graduated in fouryears.Brandon was very much his father’s son. When he was eight, he told his mother hewas going to grow up to be an actor. “He was a prankster, a practical joker, adaredevil, a showman,” says Shannon. “He was extremely physically coordinated.One day he decided he wanted to be able to do a backflip. He had it by the thirdtime.” Brandon was also a charismatic rebel, who got expelled from his eliteprivate high school, Chadwick, after leading protests against theadministration. “He started convincing students not to go to class,” Shannonrecalls. He got his GED and attended Emerson College in Boston but spent all histime going to New York City in search of acting gigs. After a year, Brandon quitand moved back to Los Angeles.All of Linda’s efforts to dissuade Brandon from an acting career failed. Herented a tiny bungalow in Silver Lake, bought a Harley and a 1959 Cadillachearse, and performed in little plays around town.One of his girlfriends teased him, “You’re not doing the whole James Dean thingare you?”“Baby, I’m a lot more original than James Dean,” he replied.Twenty-year-old Brandon didn’t want to follow in his father’s footsteps and makeaction movies. He wanted to be a dramatic actor, but no one would hire thehandsome son of Bruce Lee for serious roles. To jump-start his career, he agreedto make a few low-budget martial arts flicks. He went to his father’s formerassistant instructor, Dan Inosanto, for Jeet Kune Do lessons.His first big break was, ironically enough, in Kung Fu: The Movie (1986).Brandon was cast opposite David Carradine as the son of Kwai Chang Caine. Overthe next five years, he made several chop-socky flicks, culminating with 20thCentury Fox’s actioner, Rapid Fire (1992). During filming, Brandon hired Shannonto be his personal assistant. She had been banging around New Orleans for acouple years after graduation, singing in bands. Shannon asked her big brotherabout getting into acting. “It’s a tough business,” Brandon told her. “Peopletreat you like a commodity, especially if you are a woman, but if you reallywant to do this, I’ll help you in any way I can.”Image [../images/sec.jpg]That same year, Universal Studios began developing Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story,which was based on an updated version of Linda’s biography of Bruce that sherereleased in 1989. Universal optioned the book and signed a multimillion-dollardeal for the movie, video game, and merchandising rights to Bruce Lee. Rob Cohenwas hired to direct, and Jason Scott Lee (no relation) to play Bruce. Cohenhewed fairly closely to Linda’s version of her late husband’s life. The film isa laudatory love story about an optimistic young immigrant and his adoring wifeas he struggles to overcome a racially stratified system to achieve greatness.Wong Jack Man is portrayed as an evil enforcer sent to shut down Bruce’s schoolfor the high crime of teaching kung fu to white people. Bruce comes up with theidea for the TV series Kung Fu, but it is stolen from him and given to a whiteactor, David Carradine.Since the controversy surrounding Bruce’s death was off-limits, Cohen’s oneliterary invention was an inner demon—a phantom in black samurai armor thathaunts Bruce’s dreams throughout the film. In the third-act finale, the demongoes after a young Brandon forcing Bruce to defeat it with a red nunchaku. Cohenjustified the conceit as a metaphor about Bruce’s struggle for inner peace, butit played into one of the superstitions surrounding Lee’s death: The Curse ofthe Dragon.Before filming of the movie began, Universal approached Brandon about playinghis father, but he quickly rejected the idea. His father’s legend was already aheavy enough burden without that weight. For years, he had felt like little morethan a comma: Bruce’s son, Brandon. Instead he landed the part he desperatelywanted as the star of The Crow, a comic book–based story of a rock musician whoreturns from the grave to avenge his own murder. It was the film Brandon hopedwould propel him out of the chop-socky ghetto into a mainstream movie career.Production of The Crow was plagued by misfortunes. Unseasonably bad storms inWilmington, North Carolina, destroyed some of the sets. A carpenter waselectrocuted and severely burned when a crane collided with overhead powerlines. A construction worker accidentally drove a screwdriver through his hand.A disgruntled employee crashed his truck into the studio’s plaster shop. Thesituation was bad enough that Entertainment Weekly ran a story asking if themovie was jinxed. “I don’t think this is exceptional,” responded Jennifer Roth,the production coordinator. “We have a lot of stunts and effects, and I’ve beenon productions before where people have died.”A month later while filming the last scenes of the movie, Brandon Lee was shotand killed.By all accounts, including a police investigation, it was a freak accident, aterrible mistake—the result of inexperience, negligence, and corner cutting.“They wanted to make a $30 million movie,” one disenchanted crewmember saidafter quitting the film, “but they only wanted to spend $12 million to do it.”For an early scene in the movie, the second unit asked the props department toprovide a .44 Magnum revolver and six dummy rounds for a close-up shot. Theinexperienced property master realized there weren’t any dummy rounds on-set. Tosave valuable time, the decision was made to manufacture dummy rounds from liveones. The slugs were pulled off the casings of six live .44 bullets and thepropellant disposed of. The casings were then loaded into the cylinder and theweapon repeatedly fired to discharge the primers and clear any powder residue.The slugs were reattached to the empty casings to create dummy bullets.But, unbeknownst to the props department, one of the primers failed to detonate.When the gun was fired during the scene, the dummy bullet with a live primertriggered the powder residue with just enough force to propel the slug into thebarrel of the Magnum, but no further. Afterward, the gun was returned to theprops department, unchecked, for storage.Two weeks later on March 30, 1993, the same gun with a slug lodged in its barrelwas retrieved for a flashback scene where Brandon’s character, Eric Draven, ismurdered. The .44 Magnum was loaded with full-strength blanks—the casing of abullet with propellant and primer but no slug. Once again, no one examined thegun. With a slug stuck in the barrel and blanks in the cylinder, it was for allpractical purposes a loaded weapon. The revolver was handed to the actor MichaelMassee, who played Draven’s killer, Funboy. The director called, “Action.”Massee pointed the gun at Lee’s torso and pulled the trigger.For a couple of minutes, no one realized something had gone horribly wrong.An ambulance rushed Brandon to New Hanover Regional Medical Center. Despiteoperating for hours and transfusing more than sixty pints of blood, the surgeonswere unable to save him. The damage was too extensive; the .44 slug had lodgednext to his spine. Brandon Lee died of internal bleeding at 1:04 p.m. on March31, 1993, at the age of twenty-eight.He had planned, after filming wrapped on The Crow, to marry his fiancée, ElizaHutton. The wedding was to take place April 17 in Mexico. Instead Brandon wasburied on April 3 next to his father in Seattle in the plot Andre Morgan hadpurchased twenty years prior for Linda. “It is beyond my realm of cosmicthinking to think that it was meant to be,” Linda said. “It just happened. I’mnot beginning to make sense of it. I just think we were fortunate that he had asmany years as he did. They say time cures anything. It doesn’t. You just learnto live with it and go on.”As part of the publicity campaign for Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story, Bruce wasgiven a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame before a celebrity premiere of themovie on April 28, 1993. Speaking at the unveiling, Linda, who has anunbreakable spirit, urged the film community to take safety measures to makecertain what happened to Brandon never occurred again. “Brandon very much wantedto be here,” she went on to say. “He wanted to come back especially for thisceremony because, he said, his father deserved it, as well he did. We are heretoday to celebrate the life of Bruce Lee. And even though our happiness istinged with sorrow for Brandon’s absence, we are doubly delighted that the movieDragon will be premiering tonight.”And so Brandon’s death was wrapped up in Bruce’s legacy. Brandon gave a breakoutperformance in The Crow—sensitive, wry, and fierce. “Lee is sensational on allcounts in a performance that brims over with athleticism and ardor,” wrote PeterTravers in Rolling Stone. The movie became a cult classic, grossing $50 million.But it was not enough to escape his father’s shadow. “If Brandon had lived andmade 50 great films,” said Alex Ben Block, who wrote the first Bruce Leebiography, “then no one would much remember the Bruce Lee connection except assome minor footnote. But I’m afraid he is inextricably linked with his fatherforever.” It was the son’s story that became a footnote to the father’s legend.After Brandon’s death, Shannon followed in her brother’s footsteps, takingacting classes and studying Jeet Kune Do with Ted Wong, Bruce’s protégé. “It wasvery difficult,” she recalls, “because the timing of it all was so awful.” Moststarlets cut their teeth in horror films; as the daughter of Bruce Lee, Shannonstarted, like her brother, in chop-socky. “It’s amazingly fortunate to be who Iam,” Shannon says, “and at the same time it can be somewhat limiting.”Her first movie, Cage II: The Arena of Death (1994), went straight to video.Then she costarred in High Voltage (1997), a slight step up in the genre. “I hada hard time putting my heart into those projects,” Shannon says. “And because ofthat, I’m not very good in those movies. I was still in so much grief from mybrother’s death.”Her next part was in a Golden Harvest action flick, Enter the Eagles (1998), ariff on Enter the Dragon. They filmed in Prague. There was no script. It waschaos. “Just do it like your dad would do it,” the director would say to her. “Ifelt so much pressure to carry on the legacy,” Shannon recalls. “I would go backto my hotel room and cry a lot.” After that film, Shannon’s acting careerstalled.Image [../images/sec.jpg]Almost as soon as he invented Jeet Kune Do in 1968, Bruce came to regret givingit a name. He could not escape the paradox that his constantly evolving “Styleof No Style” was actually a coherent system with specific techniques andprinciples. Bruce gradually grew so concerned that Jeet Kune Do would becodified and formalized, resulting in the enslavement rather than the liberationof students, that he closed down his Chinatown school on January 29, 1970. Hemade his assistant instructors—Dan Inosanto in Los Angeles, James Lee inOakland, and Taky Kimura in Seattle—promise they would never teach Jeet Kune Doin a commercial school. They could only instruct a handful of senior studentsinformally in backyard settings.As a result, after Bruce died and became an international icon, the hundreds ofthousands of fans who wanted to become just like him had nowhere to go to learnJeet Kune Do. Instead they flooded into whatever dojo was available to studykarate, judo, Tae Kwon Do, and kung fu. During the greatest boom in martial artshistory, Inosanto and Kimura kept their word and only taught privately. (JamesLee died from lung cancer in December 1972.) But a number of Bruce’s otherstudents, like Jesse Glover and Joe Lewis, leveraged their connection to Bruceto give seminars across the country. Eventually Dan Inosanto opened his owncommercial school and taught his personalized version of the martial arts—amixture of Bruce’s Jeet Kune Do, Filipino Kali, and Thai kickboxing. Havingappeared with Bruce in Game of Death, Inosanto quickly became the mostrecognized Jeet Kune Do instructor in the country with his mix-and-matchapproach referred to as Jeet Kune Do Concepts.Linda, who had inscribed on Bruce’s tombstone “Founder of Jeet Kune Do,” wasless ambivalent about his creation and anxious to protect it. Over the years anumber of enterprising grifters, who had no connection to Lee, opened studiosclaiming to be authentic instructors of Jeet Kune Do. Linda felt they weredamaging Bruce’s legacy. On January 10, 1996, she invited Bruce’s originalstudents to a meeting in Seattle to form an organization to preserve Lee’s art.The charter members, including Linda Lee, Shannon Lee, Taky Kimura, Allen Joe,and Ted Wong, became known as the Nucleus. Dan Inosanto attended the firstmeeting but decided he didn’t want to be involved. This created a schism betweenOriginal Jeet Kune Do advocates (the conservatives who favored the Nucleus andstrict adherence to what Bruce Lee taught in his lifetime) and the Conceptsgroup (the progressives who preferred Inosanto’s organization and a continualdevelopment of the art).Martial arts instructors are a notoriously fractious, backbiting lot. It is atribute to the universal respect in which Linda is held, and her experience as akindergarten teacher, that she was able to unify a large portion of Bruce’sstudents. Along with the publication of the Bruce Lee Magazine, the Nucleus’smain activity was an annual Jeet Kune Do seminar where fans could train with hisoriginal students. The seminars were a hit with the public, but the squabblingbetween Nucleus members was exhausting.After four years of refereeing the infighting, Linda decided to retire and turnthe Bruce Lee Estate over to Shannon. “She approached me very gingerly,” saysShannon, “because she didn’t want to thrust this on me and say, ‘This is yourresponsibility.’ ” Shannon was enthusiastic. Her acting career was winding down.She felt more could be done to promote Bruce’s legacy and turn it into athriving business. The Elvis Presley Estate was making over $50 million peryear; Bruce Lee’s less than a million.Shannon hired the Presley Estate’s lawyers and took a more aggressive approachto the dead celebrity business. She effectively disbanded the Nucleus, which waslosing money. She engaged in a decadelong battle to wrestle the merchandising,licensing, and video game rights back from Universal Studios. She alsoestablished a production company, LeeWay Media, to develop Bruce Lee–specificprojects: documentaries, biopics, TV series, and Broadway musicals. Along withkeeping Bruce in the public’s consciousness and spreading his message, one ofher major goals was to make the Forbes list of Top-Earning Dead Celebrities.The Forbes ranking is the dollar-and-cents metric of an icon’s continuing starpower. For years, the top five names and their earnings have been remarkablystable: Michael Jackson ($150 million), Elvis Presley ($55 million), CharlesSchulz ($40 million), Elizabeth Taylor ($20 million), and Bob Marley ($18million). In 2013, Bruce Lee became the first Asian celebrity to ever crack thelist, landing in tenth place with $7 million. He was one spot behind SteveMcQueen ($9 million)—continuing their rivalry into the afterlife. The next year,an endorsement deal with Mazda helped Bruce tie McQueen for ninth place with $9million. One imagines them in heaven teasing each other over who is the biggerstar.Image [../images/sec.jpg]For decades, the Hong Kong government ignored its most famous son. The kung fustar was not considered highbrow enough for a colony anxious about itsself-image. Lobbying efforts by fans to turn his former home in Kowloon Tong,which was operating as a rent-by-the-hour love motel, into a museum came tonaught. In frustration, the Bruce Lee Fan Club raised US$100,000 to construct astatue of Lee in a pose from Fist of Fury. Under pressure, officials finallyagreed to place it on the Avenue of Stars, a tourist attraction on the city’sharbor front. Robert Lee helped unveil the eight-foot bronze statue of his bigbrother on November 27, 2005, celebrating what would have been Bruce’ssixty-fifth birthday. It was a belated recognition of Lee’s remarkableachievements during his short life and lasting cultural impact since his death.In an America where Chinese actors were mostly relegated to meek houseboy roleslike Hop Sing in Bonanza, Bruce Lee overcame every obstacle in his ambition tobreak Hollywood’s yellow glass ceiling. He became the first Chinese Americanmale actor to star in a Hollywood movie and the first Asian since the advent ofsound. It took a quarter of a century before another Chinese actor, Jackie Chan,was able to repeat this extraordinary feat.His films launched an entirely new Chinese archetype into Western popularculture: the kung fu master. Prior to Bruce, it was only Fu Manchu, the YellowPeril villain, and Charlie Chan, the model minority. These two tiredrepresentations reinforced the stereotype of the Chinese male as submissive,non-aggressive, and physically and sexually inferior—weak and sniveling; wilybut never openly confrontational; effeminate, sexless, or gay. Smashing thisemasculated image, Lee constructed a masculinity that was physically superior,excessively violent, and sexually enticing. He was the first Asian Americanactor to embody the classic Hollywood definition of a star—men wanted to be himand women wanted to be with him. With his cocky smile, come-fight-me handgestures, and graceful but deadly moves, the chiseled Lee gave Chinese guysballs.His pugnacious performance in Enter the Dragon immediately transformed Westernperceptions of Asians. “We lived in Alameda, near Oakland, where the BlackPanthers came from,” recalls Leon Jay, a prominent martial arts instructor.“Before Enter the Dragon, it was ‘Hey, Chink,’ and after Bruce’s movies came outit was like, ‘Hey, brother.’ ” Even people who didn’t like Bruce personallyconcede the influence his films had. “He was a self-centered asshole,” says MarkChow, Ruby Chow’s son. “One thing the guy’s done, though, is that nobody takeslunch money away from Chinese kids anymore because they assume they won’t fightback.”As a result, Bruce’s films helped change Asians’ self-perception. If Bruce coulddefeat Chuck Norris on film, maybe they could do something similar in real life.Lee’s popularity helped inspire the Asian American movement in the 1970s, whichcalled for racial equality, social justice, and political empowerment. In Asia,his films presaged the rise of a more muscular and confident Hong Kong, Taiwan,and eventually China. The Chinese were no longer the Sick Men of Asia; they werea superpower.Lee transformed Western filmmaking. He introduced an entirely new genre, thekung fu film, which continues to thrive, as evidenced by The Matrix, Kill Bill,and John Wick. His impact was even greater on fight choreography. Enter theDragon not only changed who could star in action movies but how our heroesfought. Gone was the John Wayne punch. After Enter the Dragon, we required everyaction star—from Batman to Sherlock Holmes, from Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon toMatt Damon in The Bourne Identity—to be a martial arts master, as skilled withhis feet as he is with his fists.They also needed to be ripped. Bruce popularized the physical fitness movement.Prior to his films, barrel chests were the masculine ideal. Afterward Hollywoodaction heroes first flirted with the pumped, steroidal look of ArnoldSchwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone before returning to the shredded, six-packphysicality Lee embodied.Bruce was not simply an entertainer; he was an evangelist. Through the popularmedium of films, he single-handedly introduced more people to Asian culture thanany other person in history. Because of Bruce, millions of Westerners took upthe martial arts. “Every town in America had a church and a beauty parlor,” saidFred Weintraub. “After Enter the Dragon, there was a church, a beauty parlor,and a karate studio with a picture of Bruce Lee.” Many devoted martial artsstudents went on to explore the Chinese philosophical underpinnings of theirstyles. Taoist terms like “yin” and “yang” entered the lexicon.Ultimate Fighting Championship promoter Dana White has called Bruce Lee “thegodfather of Mixed Martial Arts.” Certainly the sport could never have succeededwithout the incredible burst in popularity Lee inspired. Jeet Kune Do was anearly hybrid experiment in martial arts cross-training. His pragmaticphilosophical approach undergirds the sport: “Adapt what is useful, reject whatis useless, add what is specifically your own.” Bruce put the “mixed” into mixedmartial arts.But perhaps most important in this age of polarization and ethnic strife is theexample he set and espoused. As a Eurasian, he faced discrimination from bothsides of the East/West divide. He never let it stop him. Instead he preached amessage of post-racial unity. “I think of myself as a human being, because underthe sky, there is but one family,” Bruce said. “It just so happens that peopleare different.” And he practiced it. He accepted anyone who wanted to learn fromhim. His first student in America was Jesse Glover. “If he felt you weresincere, Bruce taught you,”  Taky Kimura recalls. “He didn’t care what race youwere.”The Hong Kong statue of Bruce Lee was the second erected in the world. The firstwas unveiled a day earlier in, of all places, the city of Mostar inBosnia-Herzegovina. During the Yugoslav Civil War in the 1990s, Mostar becamebitterly divided between Catholic Croats on the west side of town and the MuslimBosniaks on the east side. After hostilities officially ended, the city decidedto erect a new peace memorial. Bruce Lee was chosen over rival nominees,including the Pope and Gandhi, after a poll of residents revealed that he wasthe only person respected by both sides as a symbol of solidarity, justice, andracial harmony. “We will always be Muslims, Serbs, or Croats,” said VeselinGatalo of the youth group Urban Movement Mostar. “But one thing we all have incommon is Bruce Lee.”"},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/ins-01.jpg]Bruce Lee’s Dutch-Jewish great-grandfather, Mozes Hartog Bosman, circa 1880.(Courtesy of Andrew E.

I vividly remember sitting on his basement couch asmy friend’s older brother walked down the stairs with a tape in his hand.The movie was Enter the Dragon, and it blew our minds.We had never seen a kung fu movie before. We had no idea who Bruce Lee was. Butafter the movie was over, he was our hero, jumping off the screen into ourimaginations. This five-foot-seven, 135-pound Chinese dude with a chiseledphysique and feline swagger replaced Luke Skywalker as our ideal of totalbadass-ness. We put down our light sabers and picked up nunchaku, crackingourselves in the skulls repeatedly as we tried and failed to learn how to usethem.As the spotlight of my friends’ hero worship moved on to other movie, pop, andsports stars, I stuck with Bruce—someone who beneath his muscles looked asfragile and vulnerable as I felt as a skinny bullied kid; someone who was notborn a deadly fighter, but who had through sheer willpower turned himself intoone. I found scratched tapes of Bruce’s three previous Hong Kong movies—The BigBoss, Fist of Fury, and Way of the Dragon—and rewound the fight scenes over andover again until they were barely watchable. I haunted the drugstores and boughtcopies of Black Belt or Inside Kung-Fu magazine whenever he was on the cover. Imemorized every detail, many of them fanciful, about his tragically shortthirty-two years of life.In college I took up Chinese and studied the philosophers who influencedBruce—Lao-tzu and Chuang-tzu, as well as the Western interpreters of Taoism andZen Buddhism, like Alan Watts. I also found a kung fu instructor to begin mytraining. After my junior year at Princeton, I dropped out and went to theShaolin Temple, the birthplace of kung fu and Zen Buddhism, to live and trainwith the monks for two years. I later turned this experience into my first book,American Shaolin. I spent the next two years studying the sport of mixed martialarts (MMA) of which many practitioners, including top promoter Dana White,consider Bruce Lee to be the “godfather.” When I had finished my second book,Tapped Out, my friend Brendan Cahill suggested a biography of Bruce Lee.It didn’t seem like a particularly good idea at first. I assumed there alreadywere several solid accounts. I was shocked to discover that the only Bruce Leebiography still in print was written over twenty years ago by Elvis Costello’sformer bassist.Bruce Lee is arguably the most famous face on the planet. He is even morepopular in Asia, Russia, the Middle East, and Africa than in the Western world.Hollywood has made two biopics about his life, including most recently Birth ofthe Dragon (2016). He consistently ranks in the top fifteen of Forbes magazine’slist of “top-earning dead celebrities,” along with such idols as Elvis Presley,Marilyn Monroe, and Steve McQueen. All of these iconic figures have properbiographies, except for Lee. Hardly a year goes by that a book isn’t publishedabout Marilyn Monroe. There are half a dozen biographies of Steve McQueen.It offended me. Bruce Lee was the first Chinese American male actor to ever starin a Hollywood movie. He inspired millions of people to take up the martialarts. He deserved an authoritative biography. I set out to write it.My methodology was fairly simple. I watched everything Bruce had ever done andtook copious notes. I read everything that had ever been written about Bruce andtook copious notes. And then I interviewed everyone who had ever known Bruce andwas willing to talk and took copious notes. Then I compiled these notes into asingle Word document in chronological order. The final file was over 2,500 pagesand a million words long.“In building a statue,” Bruce liked to say, “a sculptor doesn’t keep adding clayto his subject. Actually, he keeps chiseling away at the unessentials until thetruth of his creation is revealed without obstructions.” Once I had my mound ofclay, I chiseled away until the truth was revealed.The process took over six years. I spent six months in Hong Kong and another twoin Los Angeles and Seattle. Along the way, I interviewed over a hundred peopleand met with many others who were helpful in countless ways.I am grateful I had a chance to meet and interview Bruce Lee’s daughter,Shannon, and his widow, Linda Lee Cadwell. They were extremely generous withtheir time. I should clearly state, however, that this is not an authorizedbiography. Beyond granting two interviews, the Bruce Lee Estate had noinvolvement in this project. The content, analysis, and conclusions expressed inthis book are mine alone.In the world of Bruce Lee studies, there are five exceptional scholars: Paul Li(From Limited to Limitless) and Bey Logan (Hong Kong Action Cinema) in HongKong; Davis Miller (The Tao of Bruce Lee), David Tadman (Regards from theDragon: Oakland), and John Little (the Bruce Lee Library series) in America.This book would not have been possible without their kindness, generosity, andexpertise. They pointed the way. David Tadman was especially helpful with thephotos. John Little, to my eternal gratitude, fact-checked the manuscript.Andre Morgan provided crucial insight into Golden Harvest’s history and Lee’slast days. He was a profanely funny correspondent who kept answering myquestions no matter how trivial or annoying. John Corcoran gave me an excellenttutorial on karate point fighting. I was thrilled to receive a private lesson inWing Chun at Dan Inosanto’s academy in Marina del Rey. Ed Spielman, HowardFriedlander, and Tom Kuhn walked me through the creation of the TV series KungFu. Dr. John Stern at UCLA and Duncan McKenzie (The Death of Bruce Lee: AClinical Investigation) offered much needed medical expertise into the potentialcauses of Bruce Lee’s demise. Paul Heller handed over the original Enter theDragon screenplay for me to copy without batting an eye. Joe Torrenueva gave methe best haircut of my life and he didn’t charge me nearly as much as he didJohn Edwards.I am deeply indebted to John Little’s Bruce Lee Library series for publishing somuch of Lee’s archives, including his letters and interviews. It is invaluableprimary source material for fans and scholars of Lee. Fiaz Rafiq’s Bruce LeeConversations, Paul Bax’s Disciples of the Dragon, and Jose Fraguas’s Jeet KuneDo Conversations are fantastic collections of interviews with Bruce’s family,friends, and students. It seems like everyone who knew Bruce has self-publisheda book about their relationship. The most useful for this project were JesseGlover’s Bruce Lee: Between Wing Chun and Jeet Kune Do and Mito Uyehara’s BruceLee: The Incomparable Fighter. Charles Russo’s Striking Distance is awonderfully written exploration of Lee’s time in the Bay Area.When I began this project as a rookie biographer, Alex Ben Block, the author ofThe Legend of Bruce Lee (1974), kindly gave me a few pointers. Marshall Terrill,who wrote the excellent biography Steve McQueen: The Life and Legend of aHollywood Icon (2010), was my guru and guide. He ferreted out several interviewsubjects I never would have discovered on my own.I was fortunate to be hosted in Hong Kong by my dear friend, David Erro. Paul Ligave me a walking tour of the rooftops where Bruce Lee used to fight as ateenager. Bey Logan is a hilarious raconteur who does a wicked impression ofBruce. My Cantonese translator, Shirley Zhao, who is now a reporter at the SouthChina Morning Post, was invaluable. Chaplin Chang is a Taoist sage. Ted Thomasnearly got me banned from the Hong Kong Club—I owe him several drinks. W. Wong,the president of the Hong Kong Bruce Lee Club, was a great guide to the Leesites. Vivienne Chow at the South China Morning Post provided insight into HongKong’s movie industry. Big Mike Leeder shared his Rolodex. Robert Chua, formerlythe producer of Enjoy Yourself Tonight, brokered several crucial interviews.Phoebe Lee is the family historian and as fiery as her brother. Betty Ting Peikept taking me out to expensive lunches and refusing to let me pay. It wasawesome to meet Raymond Chow—now I know why they called him the “Smiling Tiger.”Johnny Hung introduced me to several old boys from St. Francis Xavier. MarkHuang, La Salle’s historian, went above and beyond. Not only did he set upinterviews for me with Lee’s La Salle classmates, but he also continued thoseinterviews after I had to leave.During the process of completing this book, several of the people I interviewedhave since passed away. Andre Morgan liked to joke, “As slow as you are as awriter, we’ll all be dead by the time you’re done.” It was a delight to talk toVan Williams (1934–2016), who was extremely helpful for the “Citizen Kato”chapter. I deeply miss Fred Weintraub (1928–2017). Anytime I had a problemgetting anyone in Hollywood to agree to an interview, Freddie would call thatperson up and growl, “Talk to the kid.” In the last year of his life, Freddievisited Manhattan and took me out to lunch. “Kid,” he said, “have you everthought about directing?”I especially want to thank my friend Brendan Cahill, who gave me the idea forthe project and helped rescue it when it was in trouble. Credit also goes to myfirst publisher, “Wild Bill” Shinker, for signing off on it, and my currenteditor, Sean Manning, for throwing it a lifeline when it was lost at sea. Sean’senthusiasm is infectious. My agent, Joe Veltre, was, throughout the process, areliable source of stability and strategy.Finally, I can’t say enough about my angelic and patient wife, Em. Sheencouraged me when I was down, cautioned me when I was up, and read every singlepage of the manuscript multiple times with a thick red pen. I couldn’t have doneit without her. I promise, darling, I’ll handle child care for the next year."},{"pageContent":"Images [../images/f0500-01.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"BRUCE LEE FILMOGRAPHYCantonese Films as a Child ActorDATEFILM/SERIESNOTES1941Golden Gate GirlBruce was two months old.1946The Birth of MankindUnicorn Chan costars.1948Wealth is Like a DreamHis father costars.1949Xi Shi in a DreamStage name: Little Li Hoi Chuen.1949Lady FanStage name: New Li Hoi Chuen.1950My Son A-Chang (The Kid)Stage name: Dragon Li.

RobertClouse wrote, “Grace had come to Hong Kong with her Chinese mother and Germanfather at age 19.” (Bruce Lee: The Biography, p. 9.) Bruce Thomas concurred,“Grace was the daughter of a Chinese mother and German father.” (Bruce Lee:Fighting Spirit, p. 3.) Linda Lee wrote, “Grace Lee was half German and aCatholic.” (The Bruce Lee Story, p. 20.) Even Bruce’s younger brother, Robert,stated in his book, “My mother was half-German, one-quarter Chinese, andone-quarter English by blood.” (Bruce Lee, My Brother, pp. 40–41.) Based onthese incorrect statements, it was assumed that Bruce’s great-grandfatherCharles Henri Maurice Bosman must have been German Catholic. In fact, Bruce’smother, Grace, was one-half English, one-quarter Dutch-Jewish, and one-quarterHan Chinese. Her father, Ho Kom Tong, was half Chinese and half Dutch-Jewish.Her mother was English. Grace converted to Catholicism as a teenager. Herparents’ religious affiliation is unknown, but it is unlikely either one wasCatholic.He was born Mozes [ch01a.html#note38]: Eric Peter Ho, Tracing My Children’sLineage, p. 26. Mozes Hartog Bosman’s father was an eighteen-year-old butchernamed Hartog Mozes Bosman. His mother was seventeen-year-old Anna de Vries.

Robert had two coequal wives. When he traveled with them to America in1908, they were kicked out of the country for polygamy. The story ran in The NewYork Times under the headline: “Two Wives, to Be Deported: Polygamy No Harm,Says Son of Dutch Father and Chinese Mother.”his younger brother, Ho Kom Tong [ch01a.html#note45]: There is family gossipthat Ho Kom Tong was not the son of Mozes Bosman. According to these rumors, SzeTai had an affair with a Chinese businessman while Bosman was out of thecountry. The reason for the suspicion is Ho Kom Tong’s features were moretypically “Chinese” than his brothers. In photographs, Robert Hotung looks likea member of the House of Lords, while Ho Kom Tong looks like a chubby Buddha.The problem with this argument is it is very common for Eurasian siblings tolook different. Bruce Lee appears far more Chinese than his two brothers, Peterand Robert, who have distinctive Eurasian features. Moreover, it seems highlyunlikely that a Chinese concubine to a European coolie trader would cheat onhim—or that if she did and got pregnant, he wouldn’t sell her to a brothel inSan Francisco.Cantonese Opera acting [ch01a.html#note46]: It was extremely unusual for a manof Ho Kom Tong’s stature to act on the stage, even for a charity event. At thattime, acting was considered a profession for the lower orders—a step or twoabove prostitution.married at the age of nineteen [ch01a.html#note47]: Eric Peter Ho, Tracing MyChildren’s Lineage, p. 139.in 1911 [ch01a.html#note48]: Lee Family Immigration Files, National Archives atSan Francisco.

In Eric Peter Ho’s very thoroughfamily biography, he assumes that Grace Ho was Ms. Cheung’s daughter. (EricPeter Ho, Tracing My Children’s Lineage, p. 140.) But during an interview withU.S. Immigration officials in 1941, Grace Ho stated under oath that her motherwas 100 percent English without any Chinese blood.

Yuan Buyun told reporters that he heard a street performer sing, “Abig dragon begets a slender dragon, and then the two become one,” which plantedthe idea in his head. But since the opening credits of the movie and theoriginal movie posters listed his screen name as “Dragon Li” not “Little DragonLi,” their competing claims appear to be exaggerations. One or both of them cameup with “Dragon Li” and then the diminutive “Little” was added afterward.

This story, seemingly lifted from a Hong Kong chop-sockyflick, has taken on a life of its own, appearing in otherwise sober summaries ofBruce’s life (Mary Holdsworth and Christopher Munn, eds., Dictionary of HongKong Biography, p. 252). However, according to his siblings, it is untrue.

They completely cut him off. In contrast, Mito Uyehara, a closefriend, wrote in his book about Lee, “After a few months [in America],self-reliant Bruce became disenchanted as he still had to rely on his parentsfor his miscellaneous expenses. He wanted to be self-sufficient because all hislife he was considered the black sheep of the family. ‘When I left Hong Kong, Ipromised myself that I’d not depend on my parents for any kind of help, and hereI was getting money from them,’ Bruce told me.” (Bruce Lee: The IncomparableFighter, p. 12.) After interviewing Ruby Chow, Robert Clouse wrote, “Grace toldRuby she would send some money to help with his upkeep, and it was agreed thatno one would tell his father about this arrangement.” (Bruce Lee: The Biography,p. 25.)“You’re not my auntie” [ch05a.html#note296]: Robert Lee, Bruce Lee, My Brother,pp. 156–58.

He practiced forms and felt they improved speedand power. He believed in the mystical powers of qi or chi (“internal force”).He thought the delayed death touch (dim mak) was possible. After less than ayear living in America, he reversed his position on forms and qi and began toopenly criticize traditional martial arts.

James countered it and blasted Jessein the ribs. Then he asked Jesse to punch again, countered it, and struck him inthe groin. “Years later Bruce Lee told me that James Lee had said that he wantedto impress us with the fact that he could hurt us, just in case we had somethingup our sleeves,” Jesse wrote. “Bruce also said that there was a good chance thatJames Lee might have been drinking.” James showed Jesse and Howard a fewtechniques but refused to teach them more because they wouldn’t be in Californialong enough to learn the basics of his system. When they asked James if he knewany kung fu instructors in Seattle, he said no.

Ed Hart says, “I don’t think Bruceliked teaching very much. He did a lot of stuff with a few guys, but when thegroup got bigger, he would just tell them what to do and just stand there andwatch them do it and give them some suggestions. The guy he worked out with themost was Jesse Glover. I learned more from Jesse than I did from Bruce.” HowardHall says, “James was a better teacher than Bruce. Bruce was a technician and aperfectionist, but he didn’t have patience with beginners. Jimmy conveyed thingsbetter than Bruce. (Paul Bax, Disciples of the Dragon, pp. 22–23, 138.) To befair, Bruce’s hands-off approach was typical of traditional kung fu instructionin China. Ip Man didn’t waste his time with beginners either. He worked out withhis senior students, like Wong Shun Leung, and then his senior students taughtthe novices. Ip Man would oversee classes and make an occasional suggestion. Ittook Bruce several years to adjust to American expectations for more personaland involved mentoring.maximum amount of acceleration [ch05a.html#note328]: William Herkewitz, “TheScience of the One-Inch Punch,” Popular Mechanics, May 21, 2014.“His punch got stronger” [ch05a.html#note329]: Jesse Glover, Bruce Lee, p. 55.Over the years James DeMile has claimed that he and Bruce Lee developed theone-inch punch together and no one else can do it properly. (Paul Bax, Disciplesof the Dragon, p. 113; Robert Clouse, Bruce Lee: The Biography, p. 32.) It isentirely plausible that Bruce worked on his punch with DeMile, who was a boxer.Lee was constantly absorbing techniques he liked from those around him. However,DeMile’s assertion that he is the only one of Bruce’s students who can replicatethe punch seems a bit self-serving.a 230-pound man [ch05a.html#note330]: Jesse Glover, Bruce Lee, p. 55.“I don’t think Bruce ever” [ch05a.html#note331]: David Brewster and David M.Buerge, eds., Washingtonians, p. 433.“I hated comedies” [ch05a.html#note332]: Jesse Glover, Bruce Lee, p. 48; FiazRafiq, Bruce Lee Conversations, p. 21.“The advantage for us” [ch05a.html#note333]: Paul Bax, Disciples of the Dragon,p. 59.“I want to be rich and famous” [ch05a.html#note334]: Jesse Glover, Bruce Lee, p.38.Jesse also liked to tease [ch05a.html#note335]: Ibid., p. 49.put it in mothballs [ch05a.html#note336]: Ibid., p. 76.“Bruce would act like” [ch05a.html#note337]: Ibid., p. 49.“without stuttering” [ch05a.html#note338]: Ibid., p. 66.“Bruce totally loved it” [ch05a.html#note339]: Paul Bax, Disciples of theDragon, p. 41.

In Bleecker’s scathing biography, he draws broad, unsubstantiatedconclusions from Lee’s cryptorchidism—claiming that one undescended testiclecaused Bruce to frequently suffer from impotence, an inability to develop amature musculature without the aid of anabolic steroids, and “psychosocialimmaturity” (pp. 19–20, 38). These claims are absurd. The only two physicalrisks associated with cryptorchidism are infertility and testicular cancer. Itdoes not cause impotence or stunt muscular development, and there are no provenpsychological side effects.

In another interview, Amy Sanborecalled, “At the time, Bruce watched the way the blacks moved because they weresuch great dancers. . . . I would see him watching the way they walked down thestreets. I think he would just mimic them in the beginning, and then soon hedeveloped his own unique expression.” (Tom Bleecker, Unsettled Matters, p. 37.)Lee’s kung fu movies were extremely popular in the African American community inthe 1970s. In part, it was because Bruce was a nonwhite hero sticking it to TheMan, like Shaft and other blaxploitation heroes of the era. But I suspectanother reason was because black audiences recognized something familiar in theway he moved and walked.“He didn’t do anything” [ch06a.html#note378]: Jesse Glover, Bruce Lee, p. 26.planned to open his club [ch06a.html#note379]: John Little, Letters of theDragon, p. 27.

It is possible that both Howard Hall and EdHart moved to the East Coast at the same time, but it seems more likely thatJesse Glover got the name wrong.“I don’t have a club” [ch06a.html#note381]: John Little, ed., Letters of theDragon, p. 28.“In every industry” [ch06a.html#note382]: Ibid., pp. 29–31.“I found it a little difficult” [ch06a.html#note383]: Jesse Glover, Bruce Lee,p. 62.“We didn’t like some of the changes” [ch06a.html#note384]: Peter Bax, Discipleof the Dragon, p. 114; Fiaz Rafiq, Bruce Lee Conversations, p. 37.

Howard Williams (Oakland student): “Back in thoseearly years when Bruce was going back to China to show his seniors what he haddeveloped as far as Wing Chun, his seniors were able to get in on him as manytimes as he did with them. This made him very frustrated. He almost gave up themartial arts completely, but at that point he decided he was going to be evenmore determined, not matter what it took, to develop something no one else had.From that point on, he trained fanatically, and there was no stopping him.”(Paul Bax, Disciples of the Dragon, pp. 138–39.)Chang Cheh [ch06a.html#note392]: Tan Hoo Chwoon, The Orphan, p xiv.Christine Pai Lu-Ming [ch06a.html#note393]: Eunice Lam, “Eunice Lam RemembersBruce Lee,” April 9, 2016.Amy Chan (Pak Yan) [ch06a.html#note394]: Western kung fu film fans are mostlikely to remember her from Drunken Master II (1994).“They keep casting me” [ch06a.html#note395]: Chaplin Chang, The Bruce They Knew,p. 184.“This is Hong Kong” [ch06a.html#note396]: Agnes Lee et al., Lee Siu Loong:Memories of the Dragon, p. 84.“If that had been a few years ago” [ch06a.html#note397]: Eunice Lam, “Eunice LamRemembers Bruce Lee,” April 9, 2016; Agnes Lee et al., Lee Siu Loong: Memoriesof the Dragon, pp. 76–77.

It seems likely that Palmer, who did not speakCantonese, misunderstood the situation. Circumcision was virtually unknown inthe Chinese community at the time.

There is no evidencethat he ever took another college course after he withdrew from the Universityof Washington and he certainly never got a degree in philosophy.

When I was trying tofigure out why Bruce got married so suddenly after dropping out of college, Inoticed that their first child, Brandon, had been born (February 1, 1965) onlyfive and half months after their wedding date (August 17, 1964). In my interviewwith Linda, she confirmed she was pregnant prior to the wedding. She wasn’tabsolutely certain whether Bruce found out before or after he left for Oaklandbut was inclined to believe it was before. “Did he know before he left?” shewondered. “I believe he did. Or else he came back again.” Since there is noevidence of a return trip to Seattle, I assume it was before. (Interview withLinda Lee, 2013.)“was happy” [ch07a.html#note446]: In my interview with Linda I asked, “What wasBruce’s reaction when you told him?” She answered, “He was happy. He wanted achild.

(Interview with Charles Russo, 2017.)“Honored guests” [ch08a.html#note486]: Charles Russo, Striking Distance, p. 131.As the two confident [ch08a.html#note487]: In Charles Russo’s account, which isbased on the memory of Adeline Fong, Kenneth blocked Bruce’s strike successfullythree times in a row before he raised his fists. (Charles Russo, StrikingDistance, pp. 132–34.) In Rick Wing’s version, however, Bruce failed once andthen hit the volunteer with extra force the second time, causing the young manto raise his fists in anger. (Rick Wing, Showdown in Oakland, section 654–768.)If Kenneth had blocked Bruce three times in a row, it would make no sense forhim to raise his fists. He would have been too busy basking in the crowd’scheers. Also, it would be shocking for a veteran performer like Bruce to missonce. For him to fail three times in a row stretches credulity to the breakingpoint.“I would like to let” [ch08a.html#note488]: Charles Russo, Striking Distance,pp. 133–34. Not only what he said but also the exact phrasing he used is a hottopic of debate. Bruce spoke in Cantonese. What he said onstage was repeated andaltered over countless retellings of the story. Some remember him saying, “Ifanyone thinks they can do better they are welcome to come onstage and try.”Others recall a direct challenge: “I am better than any martial artist in SanFrancisco and welcome the challenge of anyone who dares to prove me wrong.”(Rick Wing, Showdown in Oakland, section 654–768.) Charles Russo is a first-ratereporter, so his version is probably closest to the truth. Given that Bruce’sgoal that night was to recruit new students, it seems likely he would have saidsomething open to interpretation as either a challenge or an invitation to joinhis school.His recent demonstrations [ch08a.html#note489]: Charles Russo, StrikingDistance, p. 112.“Well, I’m going to open” [ch08a.html#note490]: Interview with David Chin, 2014.Others have suggested it was David who put that idea in Wong Jack Man’s head.Having learned of Wong’s ambitions to open his own school, David specificallysought him out and talked him into fighting Bruce Lee. Certainly there wereadvantages to using someone like Wong Jack Man, who was a recent arrival and notassociated with any of the local Chinatown kung fu schools, as a stalking horse.If he lost, no one in San Francisco would lose any face. For his part, Wong JackMan would later attribute his decision to “youthful arrogance.” Wong Jack Manhas only ever done one interview about the fight. It was with one of hisstudents, Michael Dorgan. (“Bruce Lee’s Toughest Fight,” Official Karate, July1980.) He refused my request for an interview. I believe Wong Jack Man heard aversion of what Bruce Lee said at the Sun Sing Theatre and, like every othermartial artist in San Francisco, was bothered by it. But it was David Chin whoconvinced Wong that fighting Bruce was the best way to launch a successfulschool. Fifty years after the event, Chin still seemed amused by how it wentdown.“He was real cocky” [ch08a.html#note491]: Interview with David Chin, 2014.“the fresh, alive” [ch08a.html#note492]: Bruce Lee, “Liberate Yourself fromClassical Karate,” Black Belt, September 1971.“The only condition” [ch08a.html#note493]: Interview with David Chin, 2014.His new Oakland branch [ch08a.html#note494]: In her second memoir, Linda Leeinsisted that the Oakland school was actually thriving: “Over the years I haveoccasionally read articles in assorted magazines which have exaggerated ourpoverty at this time. In fact, the Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute which Bruce andJames established on Broadway initially proved quite successful. The few hundreddollars per month that the institute cleared were sufficient to cover ourexpenses.” (Linda Lee, The Bruce Lee Story, p. 51.) Her account is contradictedby students of Bruce and James. Howard Williams says, “Back then Jimmy had about10 students.” (Paul Bax, Disciples of the Dragon, p. 137.) Leo Fong says, “Jimmywas struggling financially. There were not a lot of students. There were onlyabout six of us in class when I attended.” (Paul Bax, Disciples of the Dragon,pp. 123–24.) After six months, Bruce and James closed the school.His business partner [ch08a.html#note495]: Rick Wing, Showdown in Oakland,section 914–18.Bruce’s pregnant wife [ch08a.html#note496]: Linda Lee, The Bruce Lee Story, p.51.“David was saying one thing” [ch08a.html#note497]: Paul Bax, Disciples of theDragon, p. 127. Leo Fong went on to say, “After the fight, I talked to Bruce,and he agreed with me, we should go after David Chin. David Chin went intohiding after that.”in early November [ch08a.html#note498]: No one can remember the exact date, butthe first published report about Bruce Lee and Wong Jack Man’s challenge fightappeared in Ming Pao Daily in late November 1964.“Few men had a quicker temper” [ch08a.html#note499]: Linda Lee, The Man Only IKnew, p. 72.four of David’s friends [ch08a.html#note500]: The four were Ronald “Ya Ya” Wu,Martin Wong, Raymond Fong, and Chan “Bald Head” Keung. In his mid-forties, Chan“Bald Head” was the oldest member of the group and a well-respected Tai Chipractitioner. (Charles Russo, Striking Distance, p. 137.) Wong Jack Man wouldlater complain that he didn’t really know any of them and that they were “onlythere to see the hubbub.” His efforts to distance himself from the rest of thegroup indicate that Wong Jack Man came to believe he had been set up.“It was not a friendly . . . It’s all out” [ch08a.html#note501]: Ibid., p. 138.Over the years, Linda Lee has asserted that the San Francisco group unfurled ascroll with an ultimatum written in Chinese: “Stop teaching kung fu tonon-Chinese.” It is her contention that the San Francisco kung fu community wasfurious Bruce was giving away ancient secrets to white and black folks. In thisversion, Wong Jack Man was sent as an enforcer. If Bruce Lee lost he would haveto stop teaching non-Chinese and close his school. If he won, he could teachwhomever he wanted. Linda’s account was incorporated into the Hollywood biopic,Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story (1993), and has become part of Bruce’s mythology.The problem with Linda’s story is nobody else agrees with it. Wong Jack Mandenies it. When I asked David Chin, he just laughed, “I think they just say thatto make Bruce Lee look like a hero. ‘Wow, yeah, he’s teaching us white people.’It’s totally not true.” Leo Fong, who was a student and friend of Bruce Lee’s inOakland, says this tale is “bullshit.” Linda has a well-earned reputation forhonesty. Everyone who meets her, including myself, finds her to be thoughtfuland humble. She doesn’t seem like the type to invent such a defamatory story,which leads me to believe she was not the one to make it up. Bruce Lee, likemany husbands, was not always completely honest with his wife. When his young,pregnant, Caucasian wife asked him why this fight was happening, he could eitheradmit that he had insulted every single kung fu master in San Francisco or hecould say something like, “They don’t want me teaching kung fu to white peoplelike you, sweetheart.” By 1964 several kung fu schools in San Francisco hadwhite students. No one tried to shut those schools down. Multiple eyewitnessesrecall Bruce’s performance at the Sun Sing Theatre and the effect his insultingwords had on the audience. The evidence is overwhelming that this was theinciting incident for the challenge match.

To land ablow, one of the fighters must “bridge the gap.” By “broken rhythm,” Bruce meantpausing for a fraction of a second in the middle of an attack in order tosurprise or deceive the opponent.“touch sparring” [ch11a.html#note650]: “Without sparring, how do you know ifyour techniques will work?” Bruce explained to his students. “This is why Idon’t believe in karate sparring. Karate instructors claim that bare fistsparring is the most realistic but I don’t think so. When a blow is stopped,really, you won’t know if it will knock your opponent on his ass or not. Ibelieve it’s more realistic by wearing gloves and letting go with everythingyou’ve got. This way, you’ll learn to throw your punches with balance, you’llknow how powerful your punches are.” (Mito Uyehara, The Incomparable Fighter, p.42.)“When he tired me” [ch11a.html#note651]: Ibid., p. 53.“kicking dummies” [ch11a.html#note652]: Mito Uyehara, the founder of Black Beltmagazine, wrote, “Many times I used to wonder if Bruce used his students justfor his convenience, as Herb Jackson sometimes referred to himself as the ‘chiefkicking dummy.’ I don’t think Bruce intentionally tried to use his students, butoutsiders might have thought so. He never charged any of us for thelessons. . . . His students had the utmost loyalty to him. They would doanything for him. None of them ever bad-mouthed him.” (Ibid., pp. 52–53.) LeoFong, one of his Oakland students, said: “Bruce would go to different people andhe would try his stuff out, that’s why in the process those who hung out withhim learned. Basically, everybody that was close to him and worked with him werehis sparring partners. He developed with his sparring partners to trainhimself.” (Fiaz Rafiq, Bruce Lee Conversations, p. 69.)On July 9, 1967 [ch11a.html#note653]: The term Jeet Kune Do first appears inBruce’s daily planners on July 9, 1967.linguistics professor [ch11a.html#note654]: Tommy Gong, Bruce Lee, p. 101.“What does that mean” [ch11a.html#note655]: Interview with Dan Inosanto, 2013;Davis Miller, The Tao of Bruce Lee, p. 127.“I can remember” [ch11a.html#note656]: John Overall, Bruce Lee Review, p. 169.“stop hit” [ch11a.html#note657]: The instant after your opponent begins hisattack, you launch your counterattack and “stop hit” him before his attack canland.

In fact, you read a lot ofhis notes that he put together, a lot of fencing terms there. So I can see thatJeet Kune Do is really fighting like a fencer. A lot of techniques come fromboxing, but the way you think, the way you apply your technique, is more like afencer.” (Tommy Gong, Bruce Lee, p. 101.)strong side crouching forward [ch11a.html#note659]: Bruce was right-handed, sohis dominant or strong side was his right hand and foot. For a left-hander thepositions would be reversed. Boxers place their weaker hand forward (left handfor right-handers) to use the left hand jab as a pawing or probing technique andkeep their stronger right hand back for power punches. With Bruce’s focus onspeed, he believed the stronger hand should be placed closest to the opponent,so it had less distance to travel.“Faced with the choice” [ch11a.html#note660]: Ibid., p. 124.he stepped back to a fencer’s [ch11a.html#note661]: Bruce’s system of Jeet KuneDo included many other elements and techniques, like the straight lead punch,five ways of attack, nontelegraphy, and broken rhythm. He filled up severalnotebooks with his writings on these topics. Most of them are included in hisposthumous book, The Tao of Jeet Kune Do. But the most comprehensive andcomprehensible explication of Jeet Kune Do can be found in Tommy Gong’s BruceLee: The Evolution of a Martial Artist.Lee’s personal expression [ch11a.html#note662]: Bruce was extremely proud of hiscreation. “Bruce told me more than once that he wished that they gave Nobelprizes for the development of fighting systems,” says Jesse Glover, “because hewas sure that he would win one.” (Jesse Glover, Bruce Lee, p. 83.)“Sparring with Bruce” [ch11a.html#note663]: Mito Uyehara, The IncomparableFighter, p. 41.“There’s a split second” [ch11a.html#note664]: Bremer says, “Bruce was theclosest thing to a magician.” (Paul Bax, Disciples of the Dragon, p. 239.)“The thing that made him” [ch11a.html#note665]: Ibid., p. 20.Bruce’s problem [ch11a.html#note666]: Alex Ben Block, The Legend of Bruce Lee,p. 48.He could recite [ch11a.html#note667]: Mito Uyehara, The Incomparable Fighter, p.9.“Ah, to be perfectly” [ch11a.html#note668]: Alex Ben Block interview of BruceLee for Esquire.“I don’t believe in anything” [ch11a.html#note669]: Linda Lee put it this way:“He believed man is a self-made product.

Brucecopied down these quotes in his personal notebooks without including the sourcesthey came from. After his death, his notes were published and, as a result, manyof these passages were mistakenly ascribed to Bruce Lee himself rather than theoriginal author. This fact-checking error gave the impression that Bruce was agenius philosopher rather than simply a well-read student of philosophy. Many ofthese “Bruce Lee” quotes still circle the Internet. For example, BrainyQuote.com[http://BrainyQuote.com] credits Bruce Lee with this aphorism: “The key toimmortality is first living a life worth remembering.”  The actual author wasSaint Augustine.

Since his book contains no footnotes or endnotes, I asked himduring our interview if he would provide me with evidence for his assertion. Herefused. Bleecker’s book fanned long-held suspicions of steroid abuse. During myresearch for this book, I made a point of asking almost everyone who knew Bruceabout it. About half strenuously denied it (Linda said, “Oh God, no. Never.”),and about half started to whisper or asked me to turn off my tape recorder.

German chemists in the1930s were the first to isolate and synthesize testosterone. The Nazi governmentexperimented with steroids on German troops, hoping to create an army ofsuper-soldiers. The Soviet Union was the first to give steroids to its athletes.As a result, the Russians dominated strength-based Olympic sports during the1950s. To compete, the U.S. Olympic weight lifting team’s physicians researchedsteroids and developed Dianabol. The FDA approved it for human use in 1958.Because steroids facilitate tissue repair, Dianabol was used to help athletesbuild bigger muscles and to help burn victims heal. Steroid use by weightliftersand bodybuilders skyrocketed in the 1960s. The Olympics finally banned them in1972, but public opinion didn’t turn against steroids until 1988 when Canadiansprinter Ben Johnson was discovered to have used them in his victory overAmerican Carl Lewis. The U.S. Congress finally outlawed them in 1990.to almost zero [ch11a.html#note697]: One further piece of evidence againststeroid abuse: In Bruce’s autopsy, the coroner notes that both of his testicleswere of normal size.

Bruce also gave Alcindor financial advice: “Once you makethat kind of bread you attract all kinds of people. What do you think thatMuslim organization [the Nation of Islam] wants?

In the 1964Long Beach Championships, Mike Stone beat Chuck Norris to win the middleweightdivision. He then went on to beat Harry Keolanui in the finals to become thegrand champion.“You know this school is” [ch11a.html#note707]: Interview with Mike Stone, 2013.Like every good-looking guy [ch11a.html#note708]: Since point fighting was anamateur sport, the champions still had to work as bodyguards, open karateschools, and teach private lessons to survive financially. Mike Stone became thebodyguard for record producer Phil Spector. In 1972, he met Elvis Presley andhis wife, Priscilla, backstage at one of Elvis’s shows. Elvis suggested thatStone teach Priscilla karate. These private lessons led to an affair, whichcontributed to Elvis and Priscilla’s divorce several months later.Kato was better than him [ch11a.html#note709]: In my interview with Mike Stone,he said, “You have to really look deep into the mentality of all of us, ourthinking. We all have our personal agenda and we want to have relationships withcertain people for certain reasons. . . . What would Bruce gain by havingrelationships with three recognizable existing champions? Wouldn’t that elevatehim instantaneously in the martial arts world?” (Interview with Mike Stone,2013.)With that face-saving understanding [ch11a.html#note710]: In my interview withMike Stone in 2013, he stated: “During our workouts, it was really never ateacher-student relationship. He didn’t really just say hold your hand this way,do this, or do this like that.” In an interview he gave in the 1970s, Stonesaid, “It was really an exchange of ideas more than a student-instructorrelationship. There were a lot of things I wanted to pick up to improve mysparring, such as Bruce’s attitude of simplicity in self-defense.” (Editors ofBlack Belt magazine, The Legendary Bruce Lee, p. 157.)establish his superiority [ch11a.html#note711]: Mito Uyehara writes, “Bruce wasa proud and intense martial artist and whenever he confronted anothercompetitor, he would unintentionally ‘test’ him. Bruce wasn’t rude orunfriendly. He was so proud of his skill that he just wanted to prove toeveryone his superiority (in fighting).” (Mito Uyehara, The IncomparableFighter, p. 57.)arm wrestling contest [ch11a.html#note712]: Mike Stone told me that he beatBruce three times in a row in their arm wrestling contest until Bruce finallygave up. Interestingly, Van Williams told me a similar story: Bruce keptchallenging him to arm wrestle, and Williams kept defeating him.There were seven lessons [ch11a.html#note713]: Bruce Lee’s daytime planners.Stone’s seventh and final lesson was April 9, 1968.aggressive game of tag [ch11a.html#note714]: A lot of modern criticism of pointfighting is unfair. It was the only striking game in town for American martialartists. Kickboxing didn’t arrive until the early 1970s. The competitors weretalented karate stylists and genuine tough guys. Punches to the face weresupposed to be pulled but often weren’t. Injuries happened at every tournament.That said, point fighting is to mixed martial arts (or kung fu challengematches) what touch football is to tackle. While there was a danger of gettinghurt, inflicting damage was not the primary purpose of the sport. I’ve fought inthe cage and in a kung fu challenge match, and there is no comparison to pointfighting. Joe Lewis, who was considered the greatest heavyweight point fighter,eventually switched to kickboxing. “There was no defense to speak of becausenobody was getting hit,” he said of point fighting. “More than anything, it wasa game of tag. How can you call that fighting?” (Davis Miller, The Tao of BruceLee, p. 120.)If Bruce won [ch11a.html#note715]: Bruce had learned from his fight with WongJack Man that no matter who wins in a private match it quickly becomes publicand contested. Neither side will admit defeat. It was not in Bruce’s interestfor a backyard sparring match to turn into a public relations battle in thepages of Black Belt magazine.“Bruce was like a kid . . . named Bruce Lee” [ch11a.html#note716]: Editors ofBlack Belt magazine, The Legendary Bruce Lee, p. 157.a nightclub act [ch11a.html#note717]: Unfortunately, their nightclub act wasnever filmed. I would pay big money to see these three karate point fighterscroon Sinatra tunes and tell off-color jokes. The patter alone would bepriceless.misspelled his name [ch11a.html#note718]: It is unknown how Joe Lewis’s name wasmisspelled, but Black Belt probably wrote “Joe Louis,” after the AfricanAmerican heavyweight boxing champion of the 1930–40s.“I was an American fighter” [ch11a.html#note719]: “Interview with Joe Lewis,”Circle of Iron DVD extras; Paul Bax, Disciples of the Dragon, pp. 253–54.January 25, 1968 [ch11a.html#note720]: According to Bruce’s daytime planners,Lewis took six private lessons. The final one was held on March 29, 1968.“Once a week I would” [ch11a.html#note721]: “Interview with Joe Lewis,” Circleof Iron DVD extras; Fiaz Rafiq, Bruce Lee Conversations, p. 132; Davis Miller,The Tao of Bruce Lee, p. 134; Paul Bax, Disciples of the Dragon, p. 277. UnlikeMike Stone, Lewis was much more willing to credit Bruce as one of his teachersand be publicly grateful for what Bruce taught him. But it would be a mistake toassume that Joe Lewis believed Bruce Lee was a superior fighter. Like the restof the champion karate point fighters, Lewis believed he was the best fighter inthe world. He and Bruce never sparred, but Lewis was certain he could beat him.He respected Bruce as an instructor but not as a fighter because Bruce nevercompeted in karate tournaments. “You don’t have to be a good fighter to be agood coach. Bruce Lee wasn’t a fighter,” argued Lewis. “People say, ‘Oh, yes, hewas, he was a fighter,’ but we’re not talking about street fighters. Streetfighters have records down at the police departments. A (real) fighter has arecord, he has wins, losses, knockouts and draws. If you don’t have a record,you are not a fighter, that’s it—it’s a simple definition.” (Fiaz Rafiq, BruceLee Conversations, p. 133.)sparring with full protective gear [ch11a.html#note722]: Mito Uyehara, TheIncomparable Fighter, pp. 26–28. The sparring match in full protective gear wasa milestone. It didn’t quite work for the crowd, because it seemed too safe. Butit represented the future of martial arts as a sport. Once bare-knuckle karatepoint fighting died out, safety gear was incorporated into most amateur andprofessional competitions—just as Bruce predicted.a tournament in Fresno [ch11a.html#note723]: Bruce was in Fresno March 4–5,1967.“A surprising number” [ch11a.html#note724]: Linda Lee, The Man Only I Knew, p.95.stationed in East Asia [ch11a.html#note725]: Chuck Norris joined the Air Forcein 1958 and was sent to Osan Air Base, South Korea, where he began training inTang Soo Do.

Given that he was generating rock starexcitement for these karate tournaments, he began to expect rock star treatment.“Since I am the drawing power and not getting paid, at least, I expect to betreated good,” he told Mito Uyehara. “But that promoter in New York was toomuch. He placed me in a second-rate hotel and I had to find my owntransportation. Wait until he invites me again next year. From now on I ain’tgonna go nowhere for nothing.” When Bruce ignored the promoter’s invitation thenext year, the unscrupulous man went ahead and advertised that Kato would be thespecial guest. When Bruce didn’t show up, the promoter apologized to the packedaudience that his special guest couldn’t make it due to another suddencommitment. “I only heard about it after the tournament was long over,” Brucecomplained. “I don’t know how to stop these guys.” (Mito Uyehara, TheIncomparable Fighter, p. 28.)“The next time I looked” [ch11a.html#note728]: Chuck Norris, Against All Odds,pp. 48–49.On October 20, 1967 [ch11a.html#note729]: According to Bruce’s daytime planners,Norris trained with him seven times. The last lesson was held on January 31,1968.“Bruce didn’t believe in high kicks” [ch11a.html#note730]: Chuck Norris, AgainstAll Odds, p. 50.In fact, Bruce learned [ch11a.html#note731]: Jhoon Rhee also claimed he taughtBruce how to high kick. The truth is Bruce learned how to high kick from theNorthern Shaolin kung fu forms he studied as a teenager in Hong Kong. Because hedidn’t believe high kicks were practical in a street fight, he neverincorporated them into Jeet Kune Do. However, he did think they looked cool onfilm. He was eager to learn how to deliver the best-looking kicks. From his 1965screen test for Charlie Chan’s Number One Son to his 1970s Hong Kong films, itis obvious that Bruce’s high kicks evolved. In 1965, they were more compact andChinese; by 1971, they were more extended and Korean. My guess is he adapted hissidekick from Norris’s karate style and his roundhouse and spinning hook kicksfrom Rhee’s Tae Kwon Do. They didn’t teach him how to high kick, but they helpedhim improve.ripped his pants [ch11a.html#note732]: Editors of Black Belt magazine, TheLegendary Bruce Lee, p. 149.“we had 8,000” [ch11a.html#note733]: Fiaz Rafiq, Bruce Lee Conversations, p.126.Dominican Republic [ch11a.html#note734]: Ibid., p. 123.

Adjusted for inflation, $4,000 in 1967 equals $29,000in 2017. “You know karate guys are the only ones who don’t pay me a single pennyto perform,” Bruce complained to Mito Uyehara. “When I was invited to a paraderecently, I got paid $4,000.” (Mito Uyehara, The Incomparable Fighter, p. 28.)“Kato Karate Schools” [ch12a.html#note736]: Jhoon Rhee remembered the name ofthe chain as “Kato Karate Schools.” (Editors of Black Belt magazine, TheLegendary Bruce Lee, pp. 158–59.) Bruce recalled the franchise as “Kato’sSelf-Defense Schools.” (Don Atyeo, The King of Kung-Fu, p. 32.) It seems likelythat the businessmen approached Bruce with the more alliterative brand name, andhe, as a proud Chinese, immediately objected to “Karate” in the title.“But I didn’t want to prostitute” [ch12a.html#note737]: Fiaz Rafiq, Bruce LeeConversations, p. 68; John Little, The Celebrated Life of the Golden Dragon, p.20. Reflecting back on her husband’s decision, Linda said, “He could have becomea millionaire opening a chain of Kung-Fu schools. He didn’t feel it was theright thing to do because to learn his type of martial art takes very personalinstruction.” (Don Atyeo, The King of Kung-Fu, p. 32.)Seeing how Sebring [ch12a.html#note738]: Partial credit for the concept shouldalso go to Ed Parker, who was already charging celebrities like Elvis Presleyhuge sums for private lessons. Besides poaching many of his senior students,Bruce clearly copied Parker’s business model.He needed Sebring [ch12a.html#note739]: In a letter to Jay Sebring in earlyMarch 1966, Bruce wrote: “I need to have some private lessons going. The bestwould be through your introduction. I can teach the better group [more famous,wealthier] and thus not have to teach too many people. When you have theopportunity, I hope you can work on it for me. I thank you. You are a friend,Jay.” (Letter courtesy of Anthony DiMaria.)As soon as Bruce [ch12a.html#note740]: In a letter to Sebring dated March 18,1966, Bruce wrote: “As an instructor of gung fu let me congratulate you on yourspeedy progress in Gung Fu. Your adaptation is rather fast and from pastexperience I’m sure with some practice you will make it in the field of martialarts. Your movements looked darn good on Thursday night. Potentially, you’ve gotwhat it takes to be a Gung Fu man. Thanks again for everything.”a marketing list [ch12a.html#note741]: Sebring also styled Bruce’s hair andtaught him how to cut hair. “Bruce was fanatic about his hair. He was a publicperson.

All of these accounts creditCharles Fitzsimons with the idea of teaching celebrities kung fu for anoutrageous sum. In these versions, Bruce didn’t reach out for guidance untilafter The Green Hornet was canceled. But Bruce’s letters to Jay Sebring provethat Bruce and Jay came up with the plan two months before filming started onThe Green Hornet. A year later Bruce talked to Charles, because no celebritieshad signed up. Charles’s contribution was to tell Bruce he wasn’t chargingenough. Bruce then asked Sebring to reintroduce him to his celebrity clients atthe higher price point. So Bruce and Jay came up with the business plan,Fitzsimons was the consultant who fixed it, and then Sebring implemented it.Over the years Jay Sebring has received far too little credit for how much hehelped Bruce’s career. Since Sebring died before Bruce became famous, no BruceLee biographer ever had a chance to interview him. It wasn’t until Sebring’snephew, Anthony DiMaria, gave me Bruce’s letters to Jay that the extent of hisrole became clear. Almost all of Bruce’s Hollywood students (Vic Damone, SteveMcQueen, James Coburn, Stirling Silliphant) were Sebring’s clients. Jay openedthe door into the inner sanctum.On February 29, 1968 [ch12a.html#note745]: According to Bruce’s daytimeplanners, the cards were printed on February 29, 1968.“If someone confronts you” [ch12a.html#note746]: Interview with Vic Damone,2013.“But with kung fu” [ch12a.html#note747]: Ibid.Like a game of telephone [ch12a.html#note748]: Telephone is a popular children’sgame in which players form a line and the first person whispers a message in theear of the next person, and so on, until the last person announces the messageto the entire group and compares it to the original.

[Finally] I asked if thestory was true. Bruce looked at me seriously and hesitated for a moment beforehe reluctantly replied, ‘It wasn’t Frank Sinatra’s; it was Vic Damone’s. No, itwasn’t his bodyguard; it was the security guard at the casino. There’s not muchto say. I just let go a sidekick to his jaw and the big muthah just dropped.Then I walked out of the place.’ Usually Bruce was eager to elaborate hisexperiences but that was the only time, I can recall, he really cut it brief. Henever brought up the incident again. Sometimes, I just wonder if he was atfault.” (Mito Uyehara, The Incomparable Fighter, p. 18.)“Whether that story” [ch12a.html#note753]: “Audio Interview with StirlingSilliphant,” Circle of Iron DVD extras; Jose M.

The properwhite ladies of Seattle, including his girlfriend, grow increasingly suspiciousof his intentions, until Bruce’s character is given a chance to save Toy Quan’slife, at which point she immediately switches her allegiances. “I disliked thatshow,” says William Blinn, the story editor for Here Come the Brides. “It wasvery much like an old-fashioned Bonanza—you know the Oriental person saying,‘Oh, you saved my life. Therefore, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.’ And A: That’snot true—it was a television myth, and B: It doesn’t take you anywhere.

The problem was there was no actorin Hollywood who could imitate Bruce’s very distinctive Hong Kong Englishaccent. As a result, whenever Bruce opens his mouth in the episode, it is atoss-up if you will hear his actual voice or some white actor badly faking aChinese accent.

Bruce’s relationship with the three karate champions and the issue ofcredit irritated him for the rest of his life. In an August 16, 1970, profile ofBruce Lee in the Washington Star (two years after his argument with Mike Stone),the author, J. D. Bethea, wrote: “At first, it was easy to dismiss Lee’s filmedexpertise as the same old Hollywood stuff. Ironically, he’s better than he wasever portrayed on celluloid. Three of his pupils, Joe Lewis, Chuck Norris, andMike Stone, have between them won every major karate tournament in the UnitedStates at least once. Lewis was Grand Champion three successive years. Leehandles and instructs these guys almost as a parent would a young child. Whichcan be somewhat disconcerting to watch.” (John Little, Words of the Dragon, pp.97–98.) The article clearly gives the impression that the reporter personallywatched Bruce instruct Norris, Lewis, and Stone “like a parent would a youngchild.” But this is impossible. According to Bruce’s daytime planners, hestopped training Chuck Norris on January 31, 1968. He had the falling-out withMike Stone on the set of The Wrecking Crew in August of 1968. And his friendshipwith Joe Lewis ended on December 1, 1969. Either J. D. Bethea made up the sceneor he based it on something that Bruce told him during their interview. Whatseems obvious is Lee wanted the public to know that Mike Stone, Chuck Norris,and Joe Lewis were his students.“My wife says you made” [ch13a.html#note842]: Paul Bax, Disciples of the Dragon,pp. 270–71.never made it in the movie business [ch13a.html#note843]: Joe Lewis’s biggestpart was as the lead in Jaguar Lives!

Roman, if not skiing, isalways after some girls.” (John Little, Letters of the Dragon, pp. 128–31.)Bruce Lee was not, as a general rule, averse to getting stoned or getting laid.According to Polanski, “the women were impressed by his charm and Oriental goodlooks.” (Roman Polanski, Roman by Polanski, pp. 330–31.)

I snapped a few photos quickly so I wouldn’t be leftempty-handed. Who would have expected that, upon realizing he was beingphotographed, Bruce came charging at me, yelling and cursing? To be honest, Iwas a little afraid at the time, but due to my personality, I couldn’t give upso easily. Instead, I said to him, ‘Do you remember what you said at the airportrecently about friendship among Chinese? What happened to that?’ He paused for amoment and then pointed a finger at me, saying I had made him react violentlylike that. Just then, a good friend of mine on the set walked over to ask Bruceif he could take a few photos, attempting to distract him from picking on me.Bruce took this opportunity to emphasize that he was very willing to pose forphotos when people asked politely, but he would simply not stand for peopletaking photos unbidden. Just then, Bruce’s brother-in-law, Yu Ming, came out ofthe makeup room and pointed out I was a nephew of a friend, Yi Qiushui, and thathe should let me take a few portraits. At first he was surprised, then hecontinued grumbling about how it was my fault for baiting him. Every time I sawhim after that, he very politely shook my hand, making me feel a littleembarrassed about our previous encounter.

Itwould have been very simple to move the costs for Golden Harvest’s many failedmovies onto the balance sheets of Bruce’s films.

Bruce had offered her parts in two of his previousmovies, The Way of the Dragon and Enter the Dragon, but each time the part hadgone to another actress. Perhaps when Bruce promised her a role in Game ofDeath, she didn’t believe him. In this scenario, Bruce didn’t need Raymond topersuade her but rather to convince her she would actually be given the part.scorching day [ch24a.html#note1391]:http://www.weather.gov.hk/cis/dailyExtract_e.htm?y=1973&m=7[http://www.weather.gov.hk/cis/dailyExtract_e.htm?y=1973&m=7].“Bruce wasn’t feeling very well” [ch24a.html#note1392]: Interview with RaymondChow, 2013.“Raymond thought it was an excuse” [ch24a.html#note1393]: Interview with BettyTing Pei, 2013.

This was a young,inexperienced woman who loved her husband and was enormously proud of him. Sheasked me what I knew about Bruce’s relationship with women, whether or not hewas a philanderer. I told her truthfully, to the best of my knowledge, that hehad no other relationships. But Linda thought, quite accurately, that the HongKong press would devour her husband. Her major concern was how to keep tawdrythings from being said. She handled herself with considerable poise and dignity.I don’t think that anyone could’ve done better than she did. It was in my livingroom that she and Raymond Chow decided what statement they’d give to reporters.”After some internal debate [ch24a.html#note1412]: Interview with Andre Morgan,2013.“We wanted to protect” [ch24a.html#note1413]: Ibid.“Bless H.S.” [ch24a.html#note1414]: Ibid.“print with a sting” [ch24a.html#note1415]: Don Atyeo, King of Kung-Fu, p. 78.“Film star Bruce Li spent” [ch24a.html#note1416]: H.

He told me that he would discuss a newfilm with Raymond Chow that afternoon and probably would not come home fordinner.” It is possible that when Bruce left Golden Harvest for his rendezvouswith Betty, he made a pit stop at home to give his wife an alibi for the rest ofhis day, waited for her to leave for her lunch date, and then jogged over toBetty’s apartment, leaving his Mercedes at his home. If this is what happened,then Linda’s statement is not technically untrue.

Ninjas may or may not havebeen master poisoners in the ancient past, but the coroner found no evidence ofpoison in Bruce’s autopsy. As for vengeful Japanese karate masters, Bruce Lee’sfilms weren’t released in Japan until after his death. When they hit thetheaters, the Japanese public fell in love with him, and to this day he remainsa cultlike figure in that country.“A Malaysian named Kay Wah Lee” [ch24a.html#note1431]: Ibid., p. 136.

When Chow received a call from a hysterical Betty on July 20telling him Bruce wouldn’t wake up, it seems likely that Chow planned to repeatthe same process. While he was at a pay phone on the side of the road, heprobably called one of the Golden Harvest stagehands who had helped him carryBruce previously, and asked the young man to meet him at Betty’s apartment. OnceChow and the young man arrived at the apartment, they realized Bruce was alreadydead. After the scandal broke in the press and Chow was caught lying about theinitial story, he recognized that the presence of an unnamed young man in theapartment would appear suspicious, so Chow denied that the young man was everthere. The other possibility is the senior paramedic, Pang Tak Sun, wasincorrect and there was not an unnamed young man in the apartment with RaymondChow, Dr. Chu, Betty, and Bruce’s corpse on the night of July 20.

As partof Dr. Lycette’s thorough research into the subject, he wrote a letter to theU.S. Armed Forces Institute of Pathology on August 13, 1973.

On August 30, 1973,the U.S. Armed Forces Institute of Pathology replied, “The postmortem findingsseem to exclude a natural cause of death. [That said] it has not been possibleto confirm your opinion that death may be attributed to cannabis intoxication.Authenticated cases in which death has been attributed to cannabis intoxicationare not known.

Any murder theory rests on the assumption that there was a massivecover-up that included the coroner, his entire office, the government chemists,etc. There has never been a shred of evidence of a cover-up. To the contrary,the coroner, Dr. Lycette, went to great lengths trying to discover the cause ofdeath, even going so far as to write to the U.S. Armed Forces Institute ofPathology.

At the 2006meeting of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences, Dr. James Filkins arguedthat the cause of Bruce’s death was SUDEP or Sudden Unexpected Death inEpilepsy. SUDEP, accounts for 5–30 percent of deaths in patients with epilepsy,who die unexpectedly at a time other than during a seizure. It is most common inmen aged between twenty and forty. There are approximately 2,750 deaths annuallyin the United States. In close to 50 percent of these deaths, autopsies revealneurological damage including cerebral edema. (“Epilepsy Could Solve Mystery ofKung Fu Legend’s Death,”  The Guardian, February 24, 2006.) The major weaknessof the SUDEP theory is it is entirely based on the assumption that Bruce Lee hadepilepsy. There is usually a family history of epilepsy, and it most commonlydevelops in children or the elderly. Bruce was a young man with no examples ofepilepsy in his family. It also takes more than one seizure for a diagnosis ofepilepsy, because lots of different things can cause a seizure. Prior to May 10,Bruce had no history of seizures. “Dr. Reisbord told me that at no time hadBruce suffered from epilepsy,” says Linda. (Linda Lee, The Bruce Lee Story, p.154.) There is also no evidence that Bruce suffered a second violent seizureprior to his death on July 20. If he did, Betty Ting Pei, sitting in the nextroom, didn’t notice it. Finally, even if Bruce had epilepsy, the likelihood ofSUDEP increases with the number of seizures. “The risk is maximal when a personhas numerous seizures over years,” says Dr. John Stern, a neurologist andspecialist in epilepsy at UCLA, “and not much more than baseline risk for suddendeath when there have only been two seizures.” (Interview with Dr. John Stern ofUCLA, 2015.) For all these reasons, epilepsy/SUDEP is an even less likely theorythan aspirin allergy. And thus relegated to an endnote.the third most common cause of death [ch25a.html#note1484]: Douglas Casa, “ColdWater Immersion: The Gold Standard for Exertional Heatstroke Treatment,”Exercise Sport Science Review, Vol. 35, No. 3 (2007), pp. 141–49.three high school [ch25a.html#note1485]: Eric Brady, “Heat-Related Illness StillDeadly Problem for Athletes,” USA Today, August 15, 2011.Even now proper treatment [ch25a.html#note1486]: Interview with William Adams,2015.“Even though I” [ch25a.html#note1487]: John Little, The Celebrated Life of theGolden Dragon, p. 176.Epilogue: The Legend“Riding in the back” [epilogue02.html#note1488]: Fiaz Rafiq, Bruce LeeConversations, p. 267.“The picture is expertly” [epilogue02.html#note1489]: Howard Thompson, “Enterthe Dragon,” New York Times, August 18, 1973.“In my most civilized” [epilogue02.html#note1490]: William Paul, “Getting theThrust of Kung Fu,” Village Voice, April 30, 1973.“Warner’s lawyer sent” [epilogue02.html#note1491]: Interview with Michael Allin,2013.“If I could send Bruce” [epilogue02.html#note1492]: Alex Ben Block, The Legendof Bruce Lee, p. 157.His 1974 song [epilogue02.html#note1493]: Simon Braund, “Rise of the Dragon,”Empire Magazine, August 2013.thirty different Hong Kong [epilogue02.html#note1494]: Alex Ben Block, TheLegend of Bruce Lee, p. 158.grossed nearly $50 million [epilogue02.html#note1495]: Kenneth Turan, “TheApotheosis of Bruce Lee: An Actor Dies; A Posthumous Industry is Born,” AmericanFilm, October 1975.Three episodes of [epilogue02.html#note1496]: Martin Grams Jr., The GreenHornet, p. 364.“Mr. Lee, who played” [epilogue02.html#note1497]: Vincent Canby, “ ‘GreenHornet,’ From Bruce Lee Series,” New York Times, November 28, 1974.

A few foolish hoodlums attemptedto use them in the commission of crimes—causing an international nunchaku panic.“The fad has really caught on,” one Los Angeles police officer told the press inlate 1973. “Every ten or fifteen blocks you see a karate school, and we’ve had acouple of robberies where the suspects have tried to hit their victims over thehead with fighting sticks.” Nunchakus were outlawed in England and severalAmerican states.

According to Bleecker, Bruce died with only US$23,000in cash. His Kowloon Tong mansion was his only major asset. It was sold for$180,000, netting Linda $40,000. As for the life insurance companies, Lloyd’s ofLondon only agreed to pay out $129,000 on Bruce’s $1,350,000 policy. AmericanInternational Assurance Company (AIA), who sent a lawyer to the coroner’sinquest, agreed to pay $100,000 on Bruce’s $200,000 policy. Both companiescontended that Bruce’s false statement on the application forms that he hadnever used illegal drugs nullified the policies but settled before the case wastaken to court. As for Bruce’s half of Concord Productions—the profits from Wayof the Dragon, Enter the Dragon, and the future value of Game of Death—RaymondChow eventually paid Linda US$2,700,000. So the total value of Bruce Lee’sestate, not deducting for taxation and extensive legal fees, wasUS$2,992,000—the equivalent of $13 million in 2017 dollars.
