But there is such a significant amount ofnew material here that it can be considered to be a new work rather than anupdating of the previous one. In the course of researching new material I’vetaken the opportunity to re-interview several people and correct some mistakesin previous accounts of Bruce Lee’s life and work – not only in my own book butalso in those of other biographers. I’ve also taken the opportunity to compile anew photo section.Many of the new interviews and new material concerns ‘the Seattle years’, whichare often little more than a footnote to Bruce Lee’s headlong rush to stardom.But as these were the happiest years of his life I have given them theconsideration and detail they warrant. This book also includes a comprehensivenew appendix, packed with detailed information and anecdotal material that wouldhave interrupted the flow of the narrative text. This new section also includesreferences to projects that Bruce Lee set in motion but was unable to complete.As the years have passed since Bruce Lee’s death it has become possible to seemore accurately what his legacy is becoming. In redefining action films he setthe stage for a new era of filmmaking. A film like Kill Bill openly acknowledgesthis by having its star Uma Thurman wear an iconic yellow and black track suitsimilar to the one Bruce wore in Game of Death, as well as lifting dialogue fromFist of Fury. Bruce Lee was the driving force behind moving martial arts andmartial sport into modern era, and the development of mixed martial arts and‘ultimate fighting’ is a direct result of Bruce’s application of his ‘jeet kunedo’ philosophy to sports karate, the introduction of full-contact fighting andthe cross-pollination of styles.As an icon, Bruce Lee’s worldwide popularity continues to grow. Asian Timemagazine even placed him on their list of heroes who helped Asia ‘from povertyto powerhouse’ and from ‘imitator to imitated’. His face has appeared on postagestamps throughout the world. At the time of writing there are plans for aBroadway musical about his life, a Hong Kong theme park and, as a prelude to theBeijing Olympics, plans for a 40-part TV series The Legend of Bruce Lee.Bruce always wanted to go beyond the limits and do it faster, longer and higher,pushing the boundaries of what is physically possible for the human body, boththrough the demands he made on it and via the cutting-edge training methods heemployed. He also pushed the limits of his art, being the first Chinese man toreveal the secrets of the martial arts to the West. He even pushed the limits ofthe martial arts themselves as he rode roughshod over tradition and protocol.Not only did he break the mould of the Chinese stereotype as seen by the Westernworld, he remade the image of the Asian man through his films and personal life.All of this was underpinned by a philosophy, jeet kune do, which in its ultimateexpression reflects the nature of the Tao itself, and so is limitless in itspossibilities.Bruce Thomas"},{"pageContent":" LIFE AND WORK"},{"pageContent":" 1EARLY YEARSGrace was an attractive girl, the daughter of a Chinese mother and Germanfather. Raised as a Catholic she had come from Shanghai to the British colony ofHong Kong at the age of nineteen. While accompanying her father on his regularvisits to the opera she was taken by its comic singer and actor Lee Hoi Cheunand would make sure she always had a seat near the orchestra where he would beable to see her. Her efforts to gain his attention were not in vain. Hoi Cheunand Grace were soon married and took up residence at 218 Nathan Road in theKowloon district of Hong Kong.Hong Kong’s Cantonese Opera was more of a music hall than a classical companylike the Peking Opera. Although Hoi Cheun wasn’t a great celebrity he had anenthusiastic following that enjoyed his dramatic flourishes and he had done wellenough to become the owner and landlord of several apartments. Opium smoking wascommon among the men and Hoi Cheun was fond of saying that he smoked it ‘becauseit helps sweeten my singing voice’. Hoi Cheun was also partial to gambling, andso his cronies, as much as his family, enjoyed his company and generosity.Bruce was the fourth child born to Hoi Cheun and Grace. The Lees’ first child, ason James, had died soon after birth and this had been taken as a bad omen thatthe spirits were looking on them unkindly and trying to prevent the continuationof the family name. A daughter Phoebe was adopted, after which Grace gave birthto a healthy daughter, Agnes, and a son, Peter.While these children were lodged with relatives in Hong Kong, Grace wasaccompanying her husband on the Cantonese Opera Company’s tour of the US whenshe discovered that she was again pregnant. While her husband continued on toNew York, Grace stayed in San Francisco.On 27 November 1940 – according to the Chinese zodiac, the Year of the Dragon –between 6 and 8a.m. – the Hour of the Dragon – at the Jackson Street Hospital inSan Francisco’s Chinatown, Grace Lee gave birth to another son. To confuse anypotentially unfriendly spirits, the child was given a girl’s name, Sai Fon(Small Phoenix) and one of his ears was pierced. Grace Lee soon renamed her newson Jun Fan (Return Again) because she had an intuition that he would one dayreturn to his birthplace. On her papers, the supervising doctor, Mary Glover,nicknamed the boy Bruce and anglicized his family name to Lee. The name wasremembered, although he was never called Bruce by his family until he enrolledin college, when he was twelve years old.Early in 1941, a few months after Bruce’s birth, the Lee family returned to HongKong. The city then was nothing like it is today with its dramatic vistas ofsteel and glass, Chanel-suited businesswomen and Mercedes limos. This Hong Kongwas a seething maze of lanes threading between ramshackle apartment buildings,crowded shops and restaurants where signs projected from every availablesurface. The lanes were choked with lorries, taxis, pushcarts and rickshaws, alljostling with locals in their traditional suits of long shirts and baggytrousers. Vendors shaded by canopied stalls displayed fruit, fish and rows ofshiny hanging ducks. The atmosphere was a complex blend of exotic food andequally exotic rubbish in various stages of decay – a thick stew of smells andan oppressive, muggy heat. The humid conditions soon made baby Bruce ill, and heremained a sickly, skinny child throughout his early years.The Lees’ apartment on Nathan Road was on the second floor of an old buildingabove some shops. The narrow stairway had no door at street level, so trampsfrequently set up home in the entrance. Two sets of strong doors guarded theapartment entrance on the second floor landing, though, the outer doors withthick steel bars and the inner doors containing a peephole.One of Bruce’s most vivid memories of his early years was the occupation of HongKong by the Japanese during the Second World War (1939–45). The Lees’ apartmentwas directly across the street from a Japanese military base and Bruce’s motherlater told the story of how she would find her young son leaning precariouslyover the balcony, raising his fist to the Japanese ‘Zeroes’ circling above.Inside, the apartment was sparsely furnished. The large main room had arefrigerator at one end, a big table in the middle and a series of beds withsimple iron frames and hard mattresses against the walls. Beyond this main roomwere two smaller rooms; one held two double-deck bunks. The other, overlookingNathan Road, had a veranda containing numerous potted plants and a cagedchicken.In the unrelenting humidity and heat no bedclothes were needed at night. In themornings there was a constant queue to use the single bathroom, not that bathingdid much good as within minutes one would be covered in sweat again. Duringtimes of drought, when the water supply was sporadic, the bathtub was keptfilled and the chicken had to share the veranda with a makeshift bathing areaset up behind some curtains.When Hoi Cheun’s brother died, his widow and her five children were taken in bythe Lee family, as is the Chinese custom. Together with a couple of servants andWu Ngan, an unofficially adopted child, there were sometimes as many as twentypeople crammed into the apartment, along with assorted dogs, birds and fish.Bruce’s favourite dog was an Alsatian named Bobby who slept under his bed.It would be a mistake to think that Bruce Lee had an underprivileged background.The rent from his father’s properties, along with his income from the opera,meant that the Lees could always afford servants, but despite the fact that hisfather made good money, Bruce claimed that he never saw any of it. He complainedthat his father was ‘miserly’ and Bruce sometimes stole money from him to takefriends to restaurants. In reality Bruce’s father was not a mean man and wasknown to have paid medical bills for acquaintances who couldn’t afford them.Bruce’s father sometimes took him to the theatres where he was working and itwas there that he met Siu Kee Lun, better known to his friends as Unicorn, whosefather was also an actor in the Chinese Opera. Although Unicorn was three yearsolder than Bruce, the two boys became friends. They would fight and fence withbamboo swords, with Bruce imitating Errol Flynn in Robin Hood. Although Unicornwas older and stronger, Bruce would never admit defeat but would keep onfighting until Unicorn gave up.Bruce spent much of his early life amusing himself in the streets of Hong Kong.In a busy household he wasn’t always missed and his mother generally had to dealwith most of the trouble he caused. She paid his school fees every month butwould get calls asking why Bruce hadn’t been attending. In the end she toldBruce that it didn’t matter so much if he didn’t like school, but he had to tellher where he was going so that she knew where he was.‘Bruce never changed his character,’ said his mother. ‘He repeated the samemistakes time after time. I was disappointed with him again and again. Once Iasked how he expected to earn a living if he kept on like that and he said,“I’ll be a famous film star one day.” I scolded him and told him that the lifeof a famous film star was not as comfortable as he imagined and that their liveswere abnormal. I told Bruce, “You can’t even behave like a normal person. How doyou expect to become a famous film star?” ’But Grace Lee also has fond memories of her son. She recalls how she once sawhim looking intently from the window of the house at something down in thestreet. Suddenly he jumped up and ran out the door. When she went to the windowshe saw Bruce helping a blind man across the street. He told her that he justhad to go and help the man who looked so sad and frustrated as everyone walkedby ignoring him.It was Bruce’s sister, Agnes, who gave him the name that stuck with him forlife: Little Dragon. She recalls that even from an early age Bruce knew he wasspecial and was going to make something of his life. She also remembers himhaving nightmares and sleepwalking. The rest of the family affectionately calledhim Mo Si Tung (Never Sits Still). It was the perfect description. If Bruce wasstill, even for a moment, they thought he was sick. The only time he stoppedrunning, jumping and talking was when he disappeared to a quiet corner andbecame absorbed in a book. He often stayed up half the night reading. His motherbelieves that this caused him to become near-sighted and from the age of sixBruce had to wear spectacles.Young Bruce took great delight in playing practical jokes. After starting outwith simple gags, like packets of itching powder and electric-shock tricks, hispractical jokes became far more sophisticated. On one occasion he rearranged allthe furniture in a room to confuse the cleaner. Bruce once told his brotherRobert to imagine he was a submarine and look up the sleeve of his jacket as ifit were the periscope. As he did so, Bruce fired his depth charge and poured ajug of water down the sleeve, soaking him. Some of his other jokes had an edgeto them that wasn’t always funny. Once, after Bruce had pushed his sister Phoebeinto the swimming pool, she held his head under water until he promised never todo it again. Bruce never went into a swimming pool again after that.Bruce Lee had begun his acting career at the age of three months, before hisparents left San Francisco, in a film called Golden Gate Girl. He played therole of a female baby, carried by his father more as a stage prop than anythingelse. Although Bruce never took formal acting lessons, with his father’s helpand connections he landed his first proper role at the age of six in the HongKong-made film The Birth of Mankind. Bruce played a street kid who fights with ashoeshine boy, played by his friend Unicorn. Also when he was six, Bruce playedhis first role under the name Lee Siu Lung (Lee Little Dragon, the name by whichhe became known in Asia) appearing with his father in My Son, Ah Chung. Brucewas cast as the cute co-star to the top Cantonese film comic, Chow Shui, andplayed a streetwise kid trying to survive in Hong Kong’s sweatshops.Both in tragedies like A Mother’s Tears and comedies such as It’s Father’sFault, Bruce played street urchins and orphans. Later he was cast in rolesplaying juvenile delinquents and teenage rebels in films that imitated thosebeing made in the US. There were occasional fight scenes and already Bruce beganusing some of the gestures that would later become his trademarks: theadmonishing finger, the thumb wiped across the nose, the brushing down of thejacket sleeves and the slow-burning gaze. Altogether Bruce appeared as a childactor in around twenty pictures, the best known of which was The Orphan, a filmabout street gangs, which was made when he was eighteen. It was the only time heplayed the leading role as a child actor. Besides making these early films, hisgreatest influence came from the films he enjoyed watching.Between 1920 and 1949, Chinese filmmaking centred on the Westernized areas ofHong Kong and Shanghai, whose populations were more cosmopolitan than most ofChina. Even so, it was a highly stylized cinema strongly based on theatricaltradition. In 1949, director Hu Peng decided to make a film about a martial artsmaster, Wong Fei Hung, who lived between 1847 and 1924. Up until then mostmartial arts films were savage tales of revenge with ludicrously exaggeratedaction in which fighters could leap a hundred feet or fly through the air for ahundred yards doing endless somersaults. But both the director and the leadingactor of the Wong Fei Hung movies insisted on realistic action scenes and, forthe first time, martial arts were at the heart of the film. Apart from being amaster of the hung gar style of kung fu, Wong also practised herbal medicine,and the actor who played him had an uncannily similar background.The actor Kwan Tak Hing was, like Bruce Lee’s father, an actor in the CantoneseOpera. He was a wen wu player, which meant that he had to be a martial artist aswell as an actor. Like the character he now played, Kwan excelled in hung gar.In addition he knew the Shaolin fighting systems which were based on themovements of various animals. A master of the white crane style, Master Kwan, ashe became popularly known, was also a herbal physician and healer.As this epic series of films progressed – the director went on to make eightyfilms featuring this character, all played by the same leading actor – MasterKwan became as skilled as the master whose legend he honoured by choreographingsuperb battles with his main opponent, played by Shih Kien. The young Bruce Leecould hardly have avoided being deeply influenced by these films. During the1950s and 60s, this series of movies virtually monopolized the market. In 1956,all but four of the year’s twenty-nine kung fu pictures featured Wong Fei Hung.Bruce could recite whole scenes of dialogue from films like How Wong Fei HungRescues the Fishmonger, How Wong Fei Hung Saved the Lovelorn Monk From theAncient Monastery and How Wong Fei Hung Smashed the Flying Dagger Gang.When he was twelve years old, Bruce Lee began attending La Salle College, wheremost of the students were Chinese Catholics. Although he was in trouble from thestart, he was fortunate enough to attract the attention of one of the betterteachers, the round-faced, bespectacled Brother Henry Pang. While many of theteachers found Bruce stubborn, wild or lazy, Brother Henry was aware thatalthough Bruce was a difficult pupil he was also very bright, full of potentialand needed to be approached differently.Brother Henry channelled what would now be described as Bruce’s‘attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder’ into running errands, cleaning theblackboards and opening the windows – chores Bruce did willingly. Even so, hefound it impossible to sit still in the classroom and was continually in troublefor causing disturbances. At home Bruce spent many hours reading in bed, and hisbrother Peter recalls that Bruce already had ambitions to become a doctor,though he showed no interest in biology. It would seem that while he was veryinterested in learning he wasn’t so interested in schooling.In Hong Kong there was a long history of subjugation under colonial rule and thefeelings of resentment towards the British were long-standing. The Chinese hatedthe British almost as much as they hated the Japanese and Bruce soon became theleader of a school gang with strong anti-British sympathies. At the end of along and tedious school day, frustrations would be directed against the Britishpupils of the nearby King George V School. Bruce’s gang would gather near theschool and heap insults on the British schoolboys walking up the road, orgathered behind the fence in the playing field, until a fight got underway.These fights would continue until one side was beaten or the police arrived.Although the British boys were bigger than the Chinese and won their share offights, Bruce would never acknowledge defeat or admit that his gang had beenbeaten fairly.Phone calls and visits from the police became a regular event in the Leehousehold and when Bruce’s father came home late from the theatre Bruce wouldpretend to be asleep and hide under the blankets to avoid punishment. More oftenthan not his mother would simply ‘forget’ to tell his father. To keep out of theway of the police, fights were staged on the flat roofs of apartment buildings,the largest areas of open space to found anywhere in Hong Kong. When a black eyeor some other injury made it impossible for Grace to protect Bruce, his father,realizing what was going on, became angry and placed all kinds of restrictionson Bruce’s movements, but he wasn’t home enough to enforce his rulings. Aftercontinuing trouble led to Bruce’s expulsion from La Salle, he swept his parentsthrough the headmasters’ offices of a number of schools before finally settling,a little, at the exclusive St Francis Xavier College.Hong Kong in the 1950s was a place suffering from high unemployment, a depressedeconomy, overcrowding, homelessness and from people simply taking advantage ofeach other. Thousands upon thousands of Chinese streamed into the city in orderto escape the communist regime on the mainland. With nowhere to go, most of themtook to living in parks, on the street, in doorways or in shanties that werelittle more than sheets of board propped up and lashed together. Some squattedon roofs; some camped in apartment building stairwells. The struggle forsurvival became fierce and anyone with a job worked long hard hours every day ofthe year simply in order to eat and carry on working.Though the British government in Hong Kong provided a state education throughelementary school, only those who passed the entrance exam for secondary schoolwent further. Those who failed, which was the majority, were let loose to roamthe streets, with few opportunities except bad ones. Restless youths becamejunior gangsters looking for some excitement and a little cash. They organizedthemselves into gangs and jealously defended their territory, starting withstreet fights and ending in all-out gang warfare. Since the British police werenot armed and had successfully restricted the use of firearms, most fights wereeither hand-to-hand fist fights or bloody affairs involving knives and machetes,and many neighbourhood gangs were loosely affiliated to a local kung fu school.Although Bruce was from a well-to-do family and attended an exclusive privateschool, he still felt drawn to the streets, and he formed his own small gang:the Tigers of Junction Street.William Cheung first met Bruce Lee when an uncle who had friends in the ChineseOpera invited him to attend Bruce’s birthday party. Bruce later heard ofCheung’s growing reputation as a street fighter who practised a formidable styleof kung fu known as wing chun and sought him out to learn more.Cheung didn’t take Bruce seriously, though, and later told Inside Kung Fumagazine:The Tigers were just eight people who got together, they weren’t all that tough– they got their fur singed a lot. I told Bruce that because he was a filmactor, he shouldn’t fight but should look after his appearance.On a website interview, Bruce’s younger brother Robert recalls:One day when I was at home I heard a knock on the door. I opened it to findBruce with his head down, looking toward the ground. A few days earlier I’dheard that Bruce was supposed to fight some guy over a disagreement, and asBruce raised his head I saw that one of his eyes was black and blue. I startedto laugh and Bruce said, ‘If you think this is funny, you should see the otherguy; he has no more teeth.’ My mother rushed him into the maid’s quarters andput a boiled egg on his eye. The Chinese believe that if you put an egg over abruised eye it will heal quickly, and she wanted to do anything to help the eyeclear up before my father saw. Luckily he never found out about it.When Bruce came off worse in a gang-related fight he stormed home and demandedto be trained in an effective martial art in order to defend himself againstbullies. Although Bruce had been shown some tai chi by his father, the slowflowing movements held little appeal for him. Tai chi is more therapeutic thananything else and needs a great deal of practice before it can be used as anefficient fighting art.When Grace Lee agreed to give Bruce money for lessons he hunted down WilliamCheung and asked to train at the same school as him. Only when Bruce persisteddid Cheung finally take him to the Restaurant Workers Union Hall on Lee TatStreet, where the classes were held, and introduce him to his master Yip Man.Because Bruce was a celebrity Yip Man was pleased to take him on and he beganteaching him on the spot.The thirteen-year-old Bruce Lee took to wing chun with the kind of obsessiveenthusiasm that characterized everything he applied himself to. Yip Man’s son,Yip Chun, called Bruce ‘fighting crazy’. At first, Bruce was interested in wingchun only for fighting, but under the instruction of Yip Man he began to absorbsome of the finer points of the art that he would eventually embrace todevastating effect."},{"pageContent":" 2THE SHAOLIN WAYIn order to understand the full impact and achievement of Bruce Lee’s later lifeand work, it’s important to understand the roots from which it grew. Martial artwas introduced to sixth-century China by an Indian monk, Bodhidharma – known inChina as Da Mo – a member of the warrior caste who had entered the priesthoodand then sought to spread the teachings of the Buddha. While crossing themountains of northern China on foot, he came across the monastery at Shaolin.While there Bodhidharma saw how unhealthy and lethargic the scholarly monks hadbecome. They didn’t take kindly to being told this and refused to allow thewandering priest to stay there, so Bodhidharma retired to a nearby cave tomeditate. Legend has it that he stayed there for nine years, other accounts saythat it was only forty days, but the generally accepted period is three months.During his time in the cave Bodhidharma helped many of the local people and newsof this reached Shaolin. As a result, when he returned to the monastery he wasallowed in. Bodhidharma explained to the monks that as the body, mind and spiritfunction as one, any imbalance in this interdependent system will lead toillness, so he devised a series of exercises designed to extract chi (lifeforce) from the air by moving consciously in coordination with the breathing, ina prototype of what we might now recognize as chi kung.These exercises also had the effect of reconnecting the monks with the naturalworld and soon they developed a series of exercises derived from watching themovement of animals, which became the basis of Shaolin kung fu. These ‘animalforms’ were not only the basis of the method the Shaolin monks used to stimulateand rebalance the body-mind system, they also became a fighting method whichthey used to protect themselves from bandits while on their travels to market orother monasteries.The Shaolin way of life flourished for over a thousand years until, in theeighteenth century, the Manchus seized power in China, even though theyrepresented only a small minority of the population. Positions of authority wereonly open to ‘Manchurian candidates’, and to keep the Han majority undercontrol, the Manchus imposed severe restrictions on them. The Han males wererequired to shave their foreheads and wear their hair in a pigtail so as to makethem more easily identifiable, while the women had to bind their feet torestrict their movements. There were even limits on the number of knives a Hanhousehold could own. Surprisingly the Manchus allowed the continuation of Hanmonastic life, and as a result the Shaolin monastery became a natural home fordissidents and a hotbed of rebellious plotting.Because it took eighteen years to train a fully fledged Shaolin martial artist,it was not a realistic method of training revolutionaries to take on the Manchusoldiers. To overcome this the five most knowledgeable elders of the Shaolintemple, who have entered legend as ‘the Venerable Five’, devised a fightingstyle to overcome all the other known styles and which was faster to learn. Theelders, each a master of his own discipline, pooled their knowledge in order tocreate, or perhaps reveal, a set of root fighting principles.The first thing they did was to note the two essential aspects of any martialart: its yin or yang qualities. Firstly there were hard external (yang) stylesthat tended to commit the body’s placement before a kick or punch could belanded. This generated a lot of power but left the practitioner inflexible.Secondly there were the soft internal (yin) styles, where the body’s weight andcommitment are more adaptable, elusive and spontaneous, but which tend to lackpower. The elders reasoned that to get the best of both worlds they needed todevelop techniques that could be landed quickly and unpredictably, yet withpower.This new fighting method involved strikes thrown with total commitment, butwhich could be halted abruptly and instantly re-thrown from another angle. Theyalso determined that this new method would best suit close-range fighting.Long-range kicks and swinging punches from an opponent would be frustratedthrough a system of jams, straight-line deflecting strikes, simultaneous blocksand strikes and mobile and adaptable footwork patterns. Once in close-fightingrange the second aspect of this new method would reveal itself where physicalcontact with the opponent’s limbs would trigger the right moves spontaneously.The Shaolin elders renamed the hall in which this fighting method was evolved asthe Wing Chun hall: wing chun translating variously as ‘hope for the future’ or‘eternal springtime’. This expressed their hope for the evolution of the Shaolinmartial arts as well as their hope of defeating the Manchu rulers.But in 1768, before this new method could be put into practice, the Manchusraided the Shaolin temple and destroyed it. The only one of the five elders tosurvive was a nun, Ng Mui. While in hiding Ng Mui continued to refine anddevelop this new fighting method, calling it wing chun in remembrance of itsoriginal intention.Soon after coming out of hiding, Ng Mui met Yim the daughter of a bean-curdseller in a local market. The nun learned that the girl was having trouble froma local gangster who demanded that she marry him. The gangster had threatened toruin Yim’s father if she didn’t comply. The nun listened to the story and thenadvised a course of action. Knowing that she had perfected a fighting methodthat was both ruthlessly efficient and rapidly taught, she advised the girl totell the gangster she would marry him, but only if he could defeat her in afight. In those days it took several months to arrange a marriage, giving themtime to implement Ng Mui’s plan, and as Yim was a small, delicate girl, thegangster readily took up the challenge.At the appointed time, when the fight took place, the burly gangster attackedthe young girl with a wild roundhouse punch which she blocked as she made asimultaneous counter strike, knocking the bully unconscious with her first blow.Yim’s father asked Ng Mui if she would take care of his daughter and so the girlfollowed her new guardian to a nunnery. There Ng Mui renamed the girl Wing Chun,knowing that she was to be the future of the art. Yim Wing Chun stayed with NgMui until the nun died, then later married a salt merchant and taught him theart. After a further six links in the chain the art passed to Yip Man, whotaught William Cheung who introduced Bruce Lee to it.Yip Man began to learn the art of wing chun at the age of thirteen, but didn’tbegin teaching it until he was nearly sixty. At the age of thirteen, the youngBruce Lee began training under him. Although he was a mild-mannered and slightlybuilt man standing only five-and-a-half feet tall, Yip Man was a formerpoliceman and cut an imposing figure. He also held definite opinions. He shunnedWestern clothing, would not pose for publicity photographs and felt stronglythat only the Chinese should be taught wing chun. Bruce Lee was attracted to thestyle because of its economy and directness and its emphasis on developingenergy. As he said, it gave the ‘maximum of anguish with the minimum ofmovement’. Where Shaolin kung fu had thirty-eight forms (practice routines) wingchun has only three: the sil lum tao (Cantonese for ‘Shaolin way’), chum kil(‘searching for the opening’) and the deadly bil jee (‘stabbing fingers’).Wing chun is based on the principle that the shortest distance between twopoints is a straight line. For example, it has none of the big circularmovements of tai chi. Although there are kicks in wing chun, none is landedhigher than the opponent’s waist; the emphasis is on gaining position forclose-in fighting. All attacks are directed straight at the central axis of theopponent’s body, just as it is one’s own axis which is defended.Crucial to the effectiveness of wing chun is the unique training practice of chisao or ‘sticking hands’. The initial objective is to not lose touch with youropponent – you don’t push so hard that you move him, but you don’t hold back somuch that you lose contact, hence ‘sticking’. Chi sao is not so much an actualfighting technique as a practice designed to help one develop sensitivity to theshifting balance of physical forces in a fight. This is based on the fact thatwhen two people make a physical connection, an actual point of contact exists.With sufficient practice, it is at this point that any move, or even intendedmove, can be felt instinctively, a response which is called the contact reflex.This is similar to the experience of a fisherman who doesn’t have to see thefish nibbling the bait at the end of his line to know he has a bite.While developing this reflex action to the point where it has become not justsecond nature but first nature, the student passes through various levels of chisao training. At each stage the student must progress from predetermined movesto random moves until, at the advanced stage, he or she can practise whileblindfolded. It’s important to understand that while the practice routines ofchi sao do not apply to combat situations, the awareness and coordination theydevelop are essential. Chi sao gave Bruce Lee his first practical experience ofthe interplay of the energies yin and yang, the active and yielding forces.Wing chun has one further unique training method in which a wooden dummyrepresenting the opponent is used to simulate almost all conceivable combatsituations in 108 practice moves. The wooden dummy also has the effect oftoughening and conditioning the hands, the student is able to lock out whenstriking it, using the kind of power that might injure a sparring partner orcause injury to his or her own joints when working alone.Every day after school, Bruce Lee headed straight to Yip Man’s class,anticipating training by practising his kicks on the trees that he passed on theway. Even after training, Bruce would still thump the chair next to him as hesat at the dinner table at home. Before long William Cheung began to hearcomplaints from some of the older students who were coming off worse in theirtraining encounters with Bruce. He recalls:They were upset because he was progressing so fast. I noticed that even when hewas talking he was always doing some kind of arm or leg movement. That’s when Irealized that he was serious about kung fu."},{"pageContent":" 3TIGER OF JUNCTION STREETA year after beginning kung fu Bruce Lee took up dancing the cha-cha, mainlybecause of his interest in his partner Pearl Cho, although it also served todevelop his balance and footwork. Unable to do anything by halves, Bruce kept alist of over a hundred different dance steps on a card in his wallet. Along withfellow wing chun student Victor Kan, Bruce spent many evenings at the Champagnenightclub at Tsimshatsui, where they went to dance and admire the talents of theresident singer Miss Fong Yat Wah. A sharp dresser, Bruce insisted on ironinghis own clothes. As he left the apartment each evening, he paused for a momentin front of the mirror to check his hair and flash the confident smile thatnever failed to charm the girls.His first serious girlfriend was Amy Chan, who later became famous in the Eastas film actress Pak Yan. Whenever Bruce had any money he would take her dancing,and on their dates, he would by turns make her laugh hysterically and screamwith frustration. In private, she found him to be a good-hearted person who wasalways willing to help his friends, but as soon as they were joined by anyoneelse, Bruce turned into a chauvinistic show-off.Hawkins Cheung had also begun training with Yip Man in 1953 and he and Brucesoon struck up a friendship. Speaking to Inside Kung Fu magazine, Cheungrecalls:We started learning wing chun because of its reputation against other systems.But while learning the first form we felt frustrated. We said, ‘Why do you haveto learn this? How can you fight like this?’ Everyone wanted to learn it quicklyso that they could move on to the sticking hands exercises. The single stickinghands exercise was no fun and the younger students wanted to get through thateven quicker. When we finally got to the double sticking hands exercise, wethought, ‘I can fight now!’ If you could land a punch on an opponent you feltproud and excited. ‘I can beat him now,’ was the first thought. That was ourcharacter – everyone wanted to beat his partner first and be top dog. Egos ranwild and everyone wanted to be the best.The Old Man always told us, ‘Relax! Relax! Don’t get excited!’ But whenever Ipracticed chi sao with someone, it was hard to relax: I became angry when struckand wanted to kill my opponent. When I saw Yip Man stick hands with others, hewas very relaxed and even talked to his partner. Sometimes he threw his partnerout without having to hit him. When I did sticking hands with Yip Man, I felt mybalance being controlled by him when I attempted to strike. I was always offbalance, with my toes or my heels off the ground. I felt my hands rebound when Itried to strike him, as if he used my force to hit me, yet his movement was soslight, he didn’t seem to do anything, it was not a violent movement. When Iasked him how he did it, he said, ‘Like this,’ and he demonstrated the movementwhich was the same as the practice form.Bruce Lee was going through the same experience: trying to master a physicaltechnique, while confronting emotions like fear and anger, and rigid mentalattitudes. The challenge was to persevere. He wanted to learn how to fight andhe found it hard to follow Yip Man’s advice, which was to practise the formoften and do it more slowly. Yip Man even suggested that Bruce stop doingsticking hands at all for a while.Bruce still wasn’t secure about his new skills and often used to carry aconcealed blade or steel toilet chain as a weapon, although he didn’t use themoften. Most of his street fights involved ripped clothes and bloody noses fromblows landed by hands and feet.Leung Pak Chun, who was one of the Tigers, says:One day one of us was beaten up by a gang from Kowloon. Bruce and the otherswent off to get revenge. At first, Bruce approached them as if to talk it over,but when he got close enough to the two biggest ones, he hit them withoutwarning.These two turned out to be the family of a local Triad and William Cheung’sfather, a high-ranking policeman, had to step in and mediate to prevent troubleescalating.Bruce’s sister Agnes says, ‘He began to get into more and more fights for noreason at all. And if he didn’t win, he was furious. Losing, even once in awhile, was unbearable for him.’‘You never had to ask Bruce twice about a fight,’ said his younger brotherRobert. Part of the responsibility for this also lay with Yip Man who, besidesteaching relaxation and calmness, advised his students not to take everything ontrust but to go out and test the system.Despite Bruce’s innate aggression, the seeds of understanding were beginning totake root, and a there was a depth of questioning that went beyond the brashnessof his youth. Bruce even surprised himself by taking Yip Man’s advice to stoptraining for a while and spend some time contemplating the principles histeacher was trying to instil in him. Why was form so important? And what didthat have to do with flowing with the events around him?As he would do throughout his life, whenever Bruce wanted to calm his fierynature and reflect, he would walk by the water or through the rain. Now he spenttime walking beside the harbour, as far away from the city’s bustle as he couldget. Thinking about it over and over was no use – that would just drive youcrazy. Suppose he could grow an extra head; would that increase his capacity tounderstand? No, it was a matter of using the form he already had moreefficiently. Would he be a better fighter if he had four arms and four legs? Ifthere were humans like that, he thought, then perhaps there might be another wayof fighting!As he stood at the water’s edge, Bruce’s thoughts turned to the fish swimming inthe deep as the possibility of a new way of approaching things dawned on him.Just as the reflections of clouds passed across the surface of the water, so hewas able to see his own thoughts and feelings pass across his awareness. Hewasn’t without feelings or thoughts but somehow, here, now, he wasn’t so boundup in them. The real challenge was whether he could find this sense of self whenhe was fighting and when more powerful emotions were involved. Bruce leaned downover the water and punched at his reflection. For a moment the water yielded tothe force, parting and splashing away, but the instant he withdrew his hand, thewater flowed back into the gap. As the reflected image took shape again, hisface smiled gently. Nature had taught him something, not only about itself butabout his own nature. And right at that moment there was no separation betweenthe two.Bruce was soon to experience a new kind of conflict. When jealous juniors foundout that he had German ancestors, they put pressure on Yip Man to stop teachinghim, knowing that Yip was a staunch traditionalist who believed the art shouldnever be taught to Westerners. Yip Man’s affection for Bruce and respect for hisefforts caused him to refuse the other students’ demands. Soon people threatenedto leave the school and no one would train with Bruce, so he left of his ownaccord. At first he trained with one of Yip Man’s senior students, Wong SheungLeung, and sometimes he would intercept Wong’s other students and tell themtheir teacher was sick and there was no class that day, so they would go homeand he would gain some private instruction.At St Francis Xavier some of Bruce’s restless energy was channelled by a teachercalled Brother Edward, who encouraged Bruce to enter the 1958 BoxingChampionships, which were held between twelve Hong Kong schools. Brother Edward,an ex-boxer himself, says of Bruce, ‘He was tough but he wasn’t a bully as somepeople think.’ Bruce used to train for the approaching contest every weekendwith William Cheung, and by sheer force and determination he blasted his waythrough the preliminaries, leaving three opponents knocked out in the firstround. In the final he faced an English boy, Gary Elms – from rival school, KingGeorge V – who had held the title for the past three years.In the ring, Elms had a classical boxing style. Bruce got into trouble almostimmediately, and under some pressure in the corner he began swinging wildly.Despite the fact that boxing gloves are not the best aid to the trapping skillsof wing chun, Bruce began to use some of the blocks he’d learned and counteredwith the continuous punching and two-level hitting he’d been working on. He waspleased enough with his third round knockout win to note it in the fight diaryhe kept.Meanwhile, the street fights continued, along with contests against otherschools, and Bruce’s mother had to make frequent visits to the police station.In one such fight, the wing chun students fought the choy li fut students on theroof of an apartment building on Union Road in Kowloon. According to Wong SheunLeung it was Bruce who made the challenge. Wong recalls him as a hot-head whooften caused trouble and showed no respect for the seniors of other styles,though he insists he wasn’t the delinquent some have portrayed him to be.Bruce’s fight was set to last two rounds, each two minutes long, with Wong asthe referee. The fighters took up their positions and almost immediately Bruce’sopponent, a boy named Chung, attacked with a punch that Bruce palmed away. Thenext punch caught Bruce in the eye, shaking him up, and he reacted with a flurryof punches that fell short. He closed the distance but his blows were too wildand he was again hit on the nose and cheek. At the end of the first round Brucesat in his corner, somewhat discouraged; his eye was swelling, his nose wasbleeding and he hadn’t managed to land a single effective strike of his own.Bruce told Wong that he wanted to quit, worried that he wouldn’t be able to hidehis injuries from his father, but Wong persuaded him to go on.As the second round opened, Bruce steadied himself and took a more determinedstance, then feinted a couple of times and scored a straight punch to Chung’sface. As Chung gave ground, Bruce pursued him, hitting him repeatedly until hewent down and others intervened. Bruce was elated and held his arms aloft. Thevictim’s parents went straight to the police and Mrs Lee was obliged to sign apaper promising to take responsibility for Bruce’s good conduct.Bruce had managed to stay in school largely by coercing other pupils to do hishomework for him. Realizing that he stood more of a chance of going to jail thancollege, Grace Lee suggested that Bruce claim his right to American citizenshipbefore the option lapsed on his eighteenth birthday. At first Bruce wasn’t keenon the idea of emigrating, but his father rapidly warmed to it.Bruce told Hawkins Cheung that he was going to the US to become a dentist, butsaid he intended to earn money by teaching kung fu. Cheung reminded him that heonly knew wing chun up to the second form, along with forty of the movements onthe wooden dummy. Despite this, Bruce considered himself to be the sixth-bestexponent in their style, but he took note of Cheung’s comments and felt it mightbe a good idea to have a few showy moves under his belt before he left. To learnthese he went to see a man called Uncle Siu, who taught northern styles of kungfu. Bruce took Siu to a local coffee shop and struck a deal with him: over thefollowing month Siu would teach him some of his moves, and in return Bruce wouldgive Siu dancing lessons. They began at seven one morning, with Siu leadingBruce through two northern-style kung fu forms, a praying mantis form andanother called jeet kune or ‘quick fist’. But Siu got the worst of the deal. Heexpected Bruce to take three or four weeks to learn the forms but Bruce masteredthem in just three days, before Siu even got going with the basic cha-cha steps.Bruce had retained his friendship with Unicorn throughout their youth and theyboth became child actors. The two appeared together in Bruce’s first full-lengthfilm The Birth of Mankind, with Unicorn playing a shoeshine boy and Bruce astreet rascal who fought with him. Run Run Shaw, the head of the Shaw Brothersstudio, which employed Unicorn, now asked Bruce to sign a contract with them.Bruce told his mother he wanted to accept the offer, but Grace Lee somehowmanaged to persuade him that his best chance of making something of his lifewould come from finishing his education in the US. But before he left he managedto become the Crown Colony Cha-Cha Champion of 1958.Prior to leaving Hong Kong, Bruce had to apply to the local police station for acertificate to clear him for emigration. There he found that both he and HawkinsCheung were on a blacklist of local troublemakers. Over-dramatizing the issue,Bruce phoned his friend, ‘We’re on a known gangster list,’ he said. ‘I’ve got toclear my name, and while I’m there, I’ll clear yours too.’Whatever efforts Bruce made, however, resulted, a few days later, in a policemancalling at the Cheung household to ask questions about ‘gang relations’. Ratherthan settling matters, he’d succeeded in stirring up even more trouble. In theend Mr Cheung Senior had to pay to have his son’s name wiped from the record, sohe could go to Australia to attend college.The day before Bruce left for America, he went to say goodbye to Unicorn. Hetold his friend he felt his father and his family didn’t love him or respecthim. He felt that he had to achieve something in life, conceding that his motherwas right, and if he didn’t take this opportunity, he might end up in realtrouble.Bruce’s younger brother Robert recalls, ‘One evening Bruce came to my room witha suitcase in his hand. He put the case down and for a moment looked at me witha sad expression. He didn’t say anything, then he picked up the case, turned andleft. I guess that was his way of saying goodbye.’As he was leaving, Bruce’s mother slipped a hundred dollars into his pocket,while his father gave him fifteen. Bruce picked up his bags, but as he left theroom his father called him back. As Bruce returned, his father suddenly wavedhim away again: he was enacting a Chinese tradition. Because he had made thisgesture, even though his son was going far away, he would return to attend thefather’s funeral. Quietly and a little disappointed, Bruce picked up his bagsand continued on his way."},{"pageContent":" 4RETURN TO SAN FRANCISCOBruce Lee fulfilled his mother’s expectations and lived up to his Chinese name,Jun Fan, by returning to the city of his birth. In April 1959 he made thetwenty-one-day Pacific crossing to San Francisco. Although he was booked onboard the Presidents Line ship as a third-class passenger, he soon found thatmost of the fun was to be had in first class and contrived to spend most of histime there by giving dancing lessons. Neat and bespectacled, he looked more likea young Clark Kent than the hot-headed troublemaker who’d had to leave Hong Kongin a hurry. Back in his cabin, he considered what might happen once his 115dollars had been spent. As the ship docked, there to meet him were Mr Quan GingHo, an official of the Cantonese Opera and family friend, and his sister Agnes,who was a guest of Mr Quan’s. Bruce’s parents had arranged for him to lodge withMr Quan while he settled in and, so they hoped, made plans to complete hiseducation.Mr Quan thought that getting Bruce to give dancing lessons would be a good wayfor him to meet people and earn some money, and his first few weeks were spenton trips around the Bay Area doing just that. Bruce had taken up Mr Quan’ssuggestion and put together a dance and wing chun routine that was bothentertaining and technically difficult and which he could perform in Chinese orEnglish. This helped bring in students for his dance classes, for which hecharged a dollar per session. On weekends Bruce would do this at the VictoryHall, and it was at one of these Saturday dances that he met Bob Lee, thebrother of James Yimm Lee, a man who was later to play a big part in his life.On 19 June, Bruce got a phone call from his father, Hoi Cheun, who was in NewYork for three weeks performing with the Cantonese Opera. The following weekBruce flew to New York, where he was warmly greeted by his father as if all thetroubles of his youth had been set aside. Hoi Cheun was pleased to learn thatBruce had renewed his US citizenship which was now good for another seventeenyears.For the first few days of his visit Bruce hung around backstage duringrehearsals, but he soon grew restless and started asking if there were any kungfu teachers in Chinatown. One of Hoi Cheun’s friends, Jao Ju Yin, said thatthere was a very skilful praying mantis master, Gin Foon Mark, who taught overon East Broadway, about eight blocks from the theatre. Hoi Cheun said that he’dheard of him, but had also heard that Mark only taught privately sponsoredmembers in a closed school because he thought that many people would want tolearn the art for the wrong reasons. This only made Bruce more interested and hepersisted until it was decided that ‘Uncle Yong’, the owner of one of hisfather’s favourite restaurants, would accompany Bruce to the school to try andget him an introduction.After several minutes of persistent knocking on the door of a nondescript oldbuilding, the door opened slowly to reveal a sweat-drenched student who glareduninvitingly at the two callers. Uncle Yong explained their business and thestudent replied that sifu Mark was busy teaching a class but invited them tofollow him inside. (Sifu translates both as ‘instructor’ and ‘father’ and socarries the meaning of ‘elder teacher’.) Sifu Mark’s office was like an oldapothecary’s, with acupuncture charts on the wall and shelves lined with jars ofherbs, some containing the liniment known as dit da jow (literally ‘hit wine’)which was used to heal sprains and bruises, harden bones and strengthen sinewsin kung fu Iron Palm training.At the end of the class the master came up to greet them. As Bruce shook hishand he got a shock: sifu Mark’s hand was so soft and flexible it felt likegelatin. There were no calluses or hard ridges, only soft supple flesh. He wasbaffled that a master of tiger claw and eagle claw kung fu should have suchhands. The master asked about Bruce’s experience and Bruce told him about histime training in wing chun under Yip Man in Hong Kong. As he questioned Bruce,Mark assessed his character, and after a few minutes his face softened. ‘Maybeyou’d like to stay and watch a class?’ he said.The main teaching hall was large, about 35 feet by 100 feet. Classical Chineseweapons – butterfly knives, staffs and swords – lined the walls, along withimages of venerated masters from the past. At the far end of the hall incenseburned on an altar. At the end of the class Bruce remarked as diplomatically ashe could that his wing chun training had been more intense, causing sifu Mark torespond, ‘Not many people understand this rare system. The power in thetechniques is hidden.’In order to prove his point, Bruce asked if he could spar with one of thestudents, but every one of his attacks was blocked before it reached its target.He had to swallow his pride when he found out that the student had been trainingthere for less than a year.Gin Foon Mark explained to Bruce that praying mantis is a style that relies ongenerating internal energy rather than using muscular strength and, as in wingchun, this was achieved by the practice of chi sao, or sticking hands. He addedthat the techniques rely on practising this to the point where eventually thehands react as if they had eyes and a mind of their own. The hands should bealways alive, with each limb acting independently of any other limb in a relaxedand continuous flow, never mentally rigid or emotionally tense.Sifu Mark then touched on the secretive art of dim mak, or ‘death touch’, thetechnique of striking acupuncture points with a view to disrupting the energyflow and causing damage rather than stimulating them to encourage healing andbalance.Bruce began to realize that this man had something to offer that he wouldn’tfind anywhere else and he blurted out, ‘Sifu Mark, will you please accept me asyour student for three weeks?’ The master replied, ‘You come here tomorrownight. Don’t eat before training. The club dues are fifteen dollars.’Sifu Mark realized that Bruce hadn’t got the traditional jing mo costume, soallowed him to train in his street clothes. The first thing he did was changeBruce’s wing chun stance in which the toes are turned slightly inwards so thathis feet were parallel, then he showed him how to integrate his body force intoa punch without winding up beforehand. What impressed Bruce time and again washow sifu Mark’s hands felt so soft and supple to touch but like solid steelclaws when he fought. At dinner that night at the Bo Bo restaurant, Bruce’sfather joked to the guests that his son smelt like a Chinese herb shop. Bruce’sarms were stained dark brown from fingertip to elbow with linament.Bruce absorbed everything he was shown, so sifu Mark decided to accelerate histraining to the level of the student he had sparred with on his first visit. Heintroduced Bruce to the principle of ‘borrowing the opponent’s energy’, statingthat a fighter must have a mind and body that are fluid in expression andactions, so they fit the opponent’s tactics like water flowing into a gap. Thatway the mind and body are free to respond instinctively. Bruce remembered YipMan talking about these ideas in Hong Kong, but only now was he beginning tograsp their full significance and potential.While he was in New York Bruce’s mother Grace asked the Chows – family friendsin Seattle – to take Bruce in. Bruce spent the last morning of his visit to NewYork with this father discussing plans to move to Seattle before Uncle Tongdrove him to the airport.Back in San Francisco, Bruce was joined briefly by his older brother Peter, whorecalled how Bruce would yell out in his sleep, punching and kicking out andflinging the covers from the bed. Bruce’s stay in San Francisco was only a briefone. He was joined on the flight to Seattle by Peter, who then caught aconnecting flight to Wisconsin, where he was going to attend the university.Like Bruce’s father, Chow Ping had been a member of Hong Kong’s Cantonese Operacompany, but due to illness he’d found himself stranded in New York followingthe United States’ declaration of war in 1941. There he met his future wife,Ruby, who nursed him back to health. The couple later moved to Seattle, wherethey opened a restaurant. Ruby Chow was a tough and independent woman. Not onlyhad she flown in the face of tradition by divorcing her first husband in orderto marry Ping, she had gone against the advice of all her friends and opened thefirst Chinese restaurant outside of Seattle’s Chinatown. There she establishedherself as one of the most influential people in the local community.Ruby Chow acted as a go-between for the Chinese, sorting out problems with thepolice or immigration authorities and advising them on personal or moneymatters. She regularly took new arrivals from Hong Kong into her household whereshe provided temporary lodging and food in return for casual work until theyfound their feet in the new country. As far as Ruby Chow was concerned, BruceLee was going to be no different to any of the others who passed through. Shedid, however, go to pick him up from the airport.By the time Ruby Chow’s Cadillac turned on to Minor Avenue and stopped outsidethe restaurant, the domestic arrangements were already in place. Bruce wouldhave his own room on the third floor and work as a junior waiter, except duringbusy shifts when he would also double as a busboy. After lugging his bags upthree flights of stairs he was shown into a tiny room containing nothing morethan a single bed, a small dresser and a bare lightbulb hanging from theceiling. No sooner had he dropped his luggage than he was put to work.Life in Seattle came as a rude awakening for the young Bruce, who had thought hewas going to be the Chows’ house guest while attending school. He’d never seenhis name on a work schedule before, and being the most recently recruited memberof staff, he was also the lowest in the pecking order. Working as a waiter madehim miserable. He wasn’t exactly a natural at taking orders and there were dailycomplaints from customers about his attitude. His treatment of the other waitersand kitchen staff wasn’t much better. In his first few weeks at the restaurantBruce got a harsh lesson in how Westerners treated Asians.At the time most Westerners had a strongly stereotypical image of the Chinese,personified by Hop Sing, the Chinese houseboy in the TV series Bonanza. Brucehad seen the same attitude in Western tourists in colonial Hong Kong andresented it as much there as he resented the spineless subservience of hisco-workers here. The waiters, who had been there many years, had long sinceaccepted their lot in life, but when a customer snapped his fingers at Bruce orcalled him ‘boy’, he would plant his feet shoulder width apart, cross his armsover his chest and tilt his head slightly to one side while he glared at themthrough narrowed eyes.Bruce’s relationship with Ruby Chow quickly became hostile. Ruby expected to beshown respect and wasn’t used to being shouted at by one of her junior waiters,telling her she was taking advantage of him. In truth, Ruby and Bruce were bothforceful personalities and neither was going to give way to the other.Unsurprisingly, Ruby Chow doesn’t remember Bruce Lee fondly:If I can’t say anything good about anyone, I’d rather not talk about it . . . Itook care of him for four years. I raised five children and I treated him like asecond son. He was just not the sort of person you want your children to grow uplike; he was wild and undisciplined, he had no respect. Lots of martial artspeople are insecure; martial arts are supposed to be to defend people, but heused them to be aggressive.The insecurity he felt kept Bruce in a constant state of inner conflict anddefiance; he was a time bomb waiting to explode. Back in his room he would lieback on the small bed, staring up at the bare lightbulb hanging from theceiling. It was the last thing he saw at night and the first thing he saw in themorning, and when he couldn’t sleep, he would stare at the faint image of thebulb in the dark space above him. Even when he did sleep he tossed and turnedrestlessly, seemingly at war with the unknown forces holding him back.In the middle of one fateful night all of this came to a dramatic climax asBruce fought with what he later described as ‘a black shadow’, which held himdown for several minutes. Insisting that he’d been wide awake throughout theentire episode, he reported that the effort of resisting defeat left himdrenched in sweat. Over the years, journalists and scriptwriters have turnedthis event into a wild tale about a ‘demon’ or a ‘curse’, or simply dismissed itas a nightmare, so much so that it has become one of the most cheapened anddistorted incidents of Bruce’s life, and one that needs to be put into itscorrect perspective.As a significant event in Bruce’s life, it deserves some serious consideration,and when events have played themselves out we will return to it later to seewhat a powerful undercurrent was stirring there.As a result of his intense development as a martial artist, Bruce was rapidlystirring up the inner changes that accompany such a way of life. Bruce’s sisterAgnes relates how he sleepwalked regularly from childhood and his brother Peterrecounts how Bruce fought in his sleep. That night, it would seem that he wasn’tfighting a ghost but was being brought face-to-face with aspects of his ownpersonality which he had previously been reluctant to acknowledge. He underwentan intense confrontation with his own unconscious self in which all thecontradictions in the hidden side of his nature were made apparent to him. Itwas a confrontation that may well have felt as if he were fighting a dark force– attacking him from outside.The psychologist Jung represents this archetypal force as ‘the Shadow’. TheShadow has many aspects, but its main characteristic is that it personifies thecontents of one’s personal unconscious in a symbolic way. That is to say, theShadow gives life and personality to the hidden layers of the mind – just asthey can also be found in the symbolic events of dreams, myths and legends. Likethese images, the Shadow can be human, animal or supernatural in appearance andsometimes has dark or dangerous qualities.There are both constructive and destructive sides to the Shadow. On thedestructive side, it often represents everything a person doesn’t wish toacknowledge about him- or herself. On the constructive side, the Shadow mayrepresent hidden positive influences. According to Jung, the Shadow is bothinstinctive and irrational, but it’s not necessarily evil, even though it mightappear to be. It can be both ruthless in conflict and empathetic in friendship,and it is important as a source for learning how to accept and integrate themore problematic or troubling aspects of one’s personality.The Shadow may appear in dreams and visions in various forms and may act eitheras an adversary or a friend. The Shadow’s appearance and role depend greatly onthe experiences of the person concerned, because it develops in the individual’sown mind rather than being a figure common to everyone. According to Jung, theShadow can sometimes overwhelm a person’s actions: for example, when theconscious mind is shocked, confused or paralysed by indecision. Interactionswith the Shadow in dreams may shed light on a person’s state of mind; forinstance, conflicting desires or intentions, or perhaps a combination of drivingambition, resentment at doing a lowly job and gnawing homesickness.On the night in question, Bruce Lee experienced, in the most direct waypossible, the reality of the famous saying that the martial artist’s greatestopponent is himself. That night, Bruce did not fight a ghost or a demon but wasbrought face-to-face with aspects of his own personality that he’d previouslybeen unaware of: his anger, cockiness and insecurities.On the positive side, once these aspects or negative feelings are acknowledgedand the blocked energy is released, all the energy can now be directed to morepositive purposes. For Jung, the goal was to bring the dark to light and tobring them both into a harmonious balance, as symbolized by the yin-yang emblem.Soon after this incident Bruce embarked on a deliberate course ofself-improvement. Because he hadn’t completed his education in Hong Kong he madethat his priority, aiming to gain a high school diploma that would make himeligible for admission to the University of Washington the following year.Edison Technical Vocational School wasn’t too far from the restaurant, and on 3September 1959 he enrolled and began attending classes three weeks later.In his room at Chow’s, Bruce used the radio as a way of practising his Englishpronunciation and slang expressions by imitating the DJs. He also worked at hishandwriting skills, refining the elegant, flowing style that became so instantlyrecognizable and practising signing his name for hours until it had the symmetryhe wanted. Any extra money that he made from tips in the restaurant or that hismother occasionally sent him was spent on new clothes.One evening, after Bruce saw one of his workmates, another Chinese busboy ChinnWah Min, leave Chow’s in a shiny blue Chrysler, Bruce quickly sought him out andasked how he could afford such a nice car on his restaurant wages. Min repliedthat he worked part-time stuffing leaflets at the Sunday edition of the SeattleTimes, because the newspaper customarily hired Chinese people to do the job. Itwasn’t long before Bruce got a job there, even though it meant getting up wellbefore daylight to do it.In a letter dated 16 May 1960, Bruce Lee wrote to Hawkins Cheung, telling himthat he was still practising his kung fu and was thinking about having a wingchun wooden dummy shipped from Hong Kong. The letter continued:At present, I’m still going to the Edison High School and will be graduated thissummer. I plan to go to the University next year, that is, in 1961. Well! Istill don’t know what I’m going to major in, but when I find out I’ll write toyou again. Now I find out that all those stuff [sic] like cha-cha are just forkilling time and have little fun out of it and that study always comes first.Yes, that’s right; your own future depends on how well you have studied. Now Iam really on my own, since the day I stepped into this country. I didn’t spendany money from my father. Now I am working as a waiter for a part-time job afterschool. I am telling you, it’s tough boy! I always have a heck of a time!After his duties Bruce used to practise alone in the Chows’ parking lot. Runningthrough the wing chun forms not only gave him a connection with Hong Kong, themovements also had a calming effect on his psyche. When he resumed his workoutsas intensively as he’d performed them in Hong Kong he noticed a change in hisattitude and he became more cheerful and approachable. After his solo practicesessions he used to take a daily walk to explore the surrounding districts, andloved walking in the cool drizzle by the water’s edge, stopping and talking tothe elderly Chinese practising tai chi in Volunteer Park."},{"pageContent":" 5A NEW BEGINNINGAt Edison Tech, Bruce quickly became known as the guy who did that Asian martialarts thing. By the end of the third school week, in late September, the teachingstaff asked Bruce if he’d give a martial arts demonstration at the annual AsianDay celebration at Capitol Hill. One man who saw a notice about the coming eventwas James DeMile. As former heavyweight boxing champion for the US Air Force whonow did most of his fighting on the streets around Capitol Hill, DeMile wasintrigued enough to turn up for the display.In his neat dark suit and thick round glasses Bruce hardly looked like a fighteras he told the small crowd they were about to see something that had always beenkept secret in China. The effect was heightened by Bruce’s Chinese accent, whichmade his ‘r’s sound like ‘w’s. As he ran through various kung fu animal forms,it looked like anything but fighting and the audience grew restless. SuddenlyBruce became still and his gaze settled on James DeMile. ‘You look like you canfight,’ said Bruce. ‘How about coming up here?’DeMile looked every inch the fighter he was and couldn’t have been too worriedas the young man beside him, who weighed 140 pounds and stood only 5 foot 7inches, explained that he was about to demonstrate a simple fighting systemdevised by a tiny Buddhist nun. Bruce turned to DeMile and invited him toattack. DeMile fired out a straight right, intending to send the upstart’s headsailing over the crowd, but Bruce blocked the punch easily while countering withhis own punch, which stopped a whisker away from DeMile’s nose. From then on, nomatter what DeMile tried, Bruce was able to counter his every move. The contactreflex he’d honed from years of sticking hands practice worked automaticallyevery time.DeMile was used to street fights in which his first move was to break someone’sleg. He wasn’t used to losing a fight, let alone being made to look helpless.The demonstration continued without mercy, ending when Bruce knocked hisknuckles against DeMile’s head and asked if he was at home. Later James DeMileswallowed his hurt pride and, responding like a martial artist rather than abrawler, he asked Bruce to teach him some of his skills.Also in the audience that day was Jesse Glover, an African-American judo blackbelt and Northwest Judo Champion who discovered to his delight that he and BruceLee were attending the same school. Glover suggested that he swap his judoknowledge for lessons in wing chun, and he also told Bruce about his good friendand roommate Ed Hart, a boxer who practised judo with him. Bruce suggested theystart an informal martial arts group to work out together and pool theirexperience. Later Jesse Glover contacted his friend Skip Ellsworth, who decidedto join the group; he outweighed Bruce by a good thirty pounds and towered seveninches over him. In the last week of September, the group had its first meetingat Jesse and Ed’s apartment.One of Bruce’s first students in Seattle was John Mitsules, who briefly roomedwith Bruce; in his autobiography, The St. Ann’s Kid: A Seattle Memoir, hewrites:Part of a person’s training with Bruce focused on understanding their own value.He told people that they were special and held meaning in this world. I thinkBruce was very good at assessing levels of self-confidence and determining whatkind of support people required.You could not convince a person his feats were real by description only – he waslike watching a deft magician. You always wondered how he could be so graceful,quick and powerful at the same time. Once people saw him in action they becamebelievers. He would take on four guys effortlessly. You could feel the force inthe air when his punches came close to your nose in practice . . . To show off,he would do push ups with me lying on his back. I weighed 200 pounds at thetime.As the size of their class increased, they decided to start holding theirtraining sessions on a patch of land on the corner of Maynard Avenue and SouthLane Street, near the centre of Chinatown. Bruce knew that working out in publicwould increase the chances of attracting more interest, and new followersincluded LeRoy Garcia and Doug Palmer.Doug Palmer, who now works as an attorney in Seattle, kept a diary which recallsthe experience of meeting Bruce:I saw him give a gung fu demonstration during a street fair and was mesmerizedby his blinding speed and obvious power, by his lithe fluidity and his perfectlyexecuted moves imitating the praying mantis and other forms. The brother of afriend of mine was taking gung fu lessons from him and I mentioned that I’d liketo learn too. A week or so later, in the middle of a crowd milling aroundoutside the Buddhist temple, I felt a tap on my shoulder. When I turned, ahandsome Chinese man a few years older than I stood facing me with a hoodedexpression. ‘I heard you wanted to see me,’ he said. I introduced myself andsaid I was interested in learning gung fu. He shrugged noncommittally, then toldme where they practiced. ‘Come by and watch sometime,’ he said. ‘If you’re stillinterested, we’ll see.’Twice a week, until I left for college, I worked out with the class, sometimesin a backyard or, through the winter, in a garage. The class was small, made upmostly of men older than Bruce. Many of the students were proficient in judo; Ihad boxed for a number of years. All of us were enthralled by a form of martialart that seemed the ultimate in efficiency and deadliness . . . No one had heardof gung fu then. Comedians had a lot of fun with it – ‘Is that like egg fuyung?’ One of my high school teachers, a hulking ex-football player, asked me ifit would ‘stand up to a good ol’ Minnesota haymaker.’Bruce not only began to develop his students’ balance, speed and positioningthrough the wing chun practice forms, he also gave them an insight into itsorigins by telling them the history of the Shaolin temple, and the line thatstretched from Ng Mui and Yim Wing Chun through to his own teacher Yip Man. Heexplained that there were no showy kicks, spins or board breaking, like inkarate. The most impressive move, he said, is over in the blink of an eye, sofast that the opponent doesn’t see it coming, and in it the body’s entire chi isreleased in one explosive instant.Teaching in open public spaces, Bruce soon knew who was a casual observer andwho was genuinely intrigued. If they looked serious he would saunter up andengage them in conversation, and this was how he met Taky Kimura, who stood fortwo hours attentively watching one of Bruce’s demonstrations in an athleticsfield. Takauki Kimura was a Japanese-American who’d been held in an internmentcamp during the Second World War, where he’d taken judo lessons from a fellowinternee. Taky explained that Jesse Glover and James DeMile were regularcustomers in his supermarket and, knowing that he would be interested, Jesse andJim had told him about the incredible young martial artist they had got to know.Bruce had Taky square off in a fighter’s pose and then, in a flurry ofrapid-fire strikes, he shot out a dozen or so punches that stopped within aninch of their target.‘Man that was fast!’ exclaimed Taky.In one of the many phone conversations I had with him, Taky Kimura, a softlyspoken, likeable man who still runs his supermarket business in Seattle, recallshow he met Bruce Lee:They told me I just had to go and see him. I’d seen martial artists in Japan whowere older and more experienced, so I didn’t see how a young kid could be anybetter, but they kept insisting. I went down to a training session being held onone of the playing fields near the university, and as soon as I saw what hecould do I asked if I could join their club, although it was his thinking thatimpressed me more than his speed and power.There was a small group of us: Jesse Glover, Jim DeMile, Ed Hart and DougPalmer. We used to work out in parks or anywhere there was an open space. Iworked out with Bruce quite a lot by myself and he would encourage me tosocialize with him, but I was already taking time off work to train, andbesides, I was twice his age.At thirty-eight years old, Taky was a sad-eyed man whose confidence had takenmany knocks. Bruce was only eighteen and restless with ambition, yet the twowarmed to each other and a close friendship developed.Remember, Jesse Glover was black and James DeMile had ethnic origins. There werea couple of white guys, but most of us were from minorities. I was brought up inone of the few ethnic families in our neighbourhood and we encountered a lot ofprejudice . . . I couldn’t get served in restaurants, couldn’t get a seat on abus. I tramped the streets for six months, looking for a job. It destroyed mywhole sense of being a person. Fortunately I didn’t take to drink under thewhole stress of it all. Finally, I had to say, ‘Am I a man, or what?’ and get agrip.Later I married a Caucasian woman, who loved me and treated me like everyoneelse. Bruce would say to me, ‘You’re just as good as they are.’ Then he wouldsay, ‘Jesus, Taky! You dress like an old man; you look like you’re sixty. Getyourself some clothes.’ He didn’t only build me up physically, he built up theemotional and mental aspects, and I got myself back.Bruce was pleased to discover that Taky’s family business was only a few blocksfrom the Chows’ restaurant. It was much bigger than he’d pictured, with asizeable basement and large parking area, so it made sense to move the classthere. In return, Bruce used to chase away people who’d been using Taky’sparking lot for free while they shopped elsewhere.Although Bruce was capable of deep and genuine insight in one moment and greathumour the next, he could explode with anger almost without warning. There was aguy called Eddie Pearce, who used to hang around outside the store. I befriendedhim and he became almost like my younger brother. Eddie had a bad stutter andBruce occasionally used to stutter when he talked, although in his case I thinkit was due to difficulties with the language rather than a speech problem. WhenI introduced Eddie to Bruce, Eddie began stuttering and I saw Bruce tense up andhis fists begin to tighten, thinking he was being mocked. Once Eddie realizedwhat was going on he quickly tried to explain, ‘I–I-I really d-d-do stutter.’Which only made the problem worse and I had to step in.Bruce was a very intense young man and more than once there might have beentrouble if I hadn’t been there. One Sunday afternoon, Bruce and I were drivingthrough Seattle, being followed by a motorcycle cop. We drove on, stopping atevery red light for four or five blocks until the cop pulled us over. ‘You guysare having a really good time, driving at twenty-nine in a thirty-mile-an-hourzone.’ The cop was trying to stir something up; it was a discriminatory thing. Icould feel Bruce tensing up and I know that if I hadn’t been there he would havegone for him.James DeMile recalls an occasion when Bruce and his friends were strollingthrough Chinatown when they saw a young Chinese girl being harassed by some menin a car. Bruce walked over to the driver’s door and told the guy to cut it out.As the guy leaned out of the window to threaten him, Bruce snapped a backfistinto the man’s face, busting his nose before the car sped off.As the group of friends trained at the back of Taky’s supermarket, Bruce wouldsometimes become serious and start lecturing them. This meant only one thing:there was a girl around. As Bruce’s lecture continued, Jim DeMile would try toslide away. It was DeMile’s misfortune to look more menacing and murderous thanany of the other guys, and if there was a girl Bruce wanted to impress, he wasthe natural choice for a demonstration: ‘Now what I do in my system is . . . Ah,Jim!’James DeMile doesn’t believe that Bruce set out to teach intentionally:It was more like he was saying, ‘Here’s what I have to offer, you take it. Inthe meantime, I’m going to be training and developing myself.’ Fortunately, Iabsorbed a tremendous amount of his philosophy and technical skill because I wasinterested. I also became more focused and aware of myself and more in controlof my movements. It helped in my evolution as a person and in my confidence.Meanwhile, Bruce was changing as he developed more flow, more energy and moreintensity. His time in Seattle was one of experimenting with various stances andtechniques to overcome his limitations.Bruce also began training with his students one-to-one at their homes.Unsurprisingly, he discovered that none of them were the same. Some werecoordinated, others were slow; some were smooth and fluid, others wereaggressive and forceful. But since all of them were much bigger and physicallystronger than him, Bruce had to use every bit of his experience to subdue them.This private training turned out to be a double-edged sword, though, as hewondered how much he could reveal to a student before they would become a threatto him. He wanted them to do well . . . but not too well.In Hong Kong, Bruce had fought with people his own size, but now he was facedwith opponents who were seventy pounds heavier and six inches taller than him,what he called ‘trucks rolling in’. Bruce knew that if he was ever hit bysomeone like DeMile, or even worse by someone at a public demonstration he wouldbe hurt, and so would his reputation. It wasn’t simply a matter of pride; it wasa matter of survival.As Bruce’s nucleus of students showed real signs of improvement, privately heintensified his own training, increasing the number of push-ups, sit-ups andbody-strengthening routines he did. He adapted the wing chun stance so that itlooked more like a boxer’s crouch and began mixing in some of the praying mantistechniques he’d learned back in New York. The group also began asking morequestions about the background of martial arts and Bruce realized he needed tospend more time in the library searching out texts on Chinese philosophy.After an impromptu demonstration at a social gathering, Bruce met aJapanese-American girl named Amy Sanbo who, like Taky, had been held in aninternment camp during the war. She wasn’t bitter about the experience and was alively, intelligent, ambitious girl who planned to become a writer and dancer.If anything, Bruce felt slightly intimidated by her and felt obliged to tell herabout his time as a child star before announcing that he was once a cha-chachampion in Hong Kong. She told him she couldn’t understand why he didn’t pursuea career as a dancer instead of one in martial arts.Whenever Bruce and Amy were out together it was usually Amy who was thelistener. She would force a chuckle at some of his off-colour jokes and thentell him that although he was fond of quoting philosophy, he didn’t alwayspractise what he preached. While Amy showed compassion for those who were lessfortunate, Bruce’s opinion was that anyone who was in a hole could get out of itif they wanted to. Most of the time, however, their talk was about kung fu andBruce’s ambitions for the future.As Bruce and his group of students grew closer, they began to talk openly abouttheir relationships, personal problems and needs. Although Bruce never saidanything about his poor financial situation, except to say that he thought hisjob at Chow’s was below his natural station in life, Jesse Glover made anoff-the-cuff remark that Bruce should begin charging a fee for his teaching,just as a lawyer, doctor, accountant or other professional would. Jesse reckonedthat a lot more people might take advantage of what Bruce had to offer, so Brucesent his students out on a word-of-mouth PR exercise to spread the news that anew kung fu school would soon be opening.On 27 November 1960, while they were celebrating Bruce’s twentieth birthday atthe Tai Tung restaurant, Jesse Glover suggested that to get things moving theregulars would each pay him four dollars a week. In the meantime, because therewere no funds for advertising, they would attract new students by holding moreclasses in public, in parks, gyms and recreation centres. Without a car, though,Bruce was finding it more and more difficult to get around Seattle to differentvenues, not to mention taking Amy on a date.Taky Kimura offered to help: ‘I was happy to take him on his dates, because hewas doing something for me, but my family wasn’t so happy when I had to get upat 2a.m. to go and collect him.’Whenever Taky arrived to pick up Bruce and Amy from a party he would likely findBruce performing one-finger push-ups or demonstrating some kung fu technique.When Amy accused him of being a show-off he said he was only doing it to see ifhe could attract new students, but Amy felt ignored. Bruce wouldn’t talk abouther ambitions to be a writer and dancer; all he wanted was for her to supporthim. He told her that he wanted to become wealthy and independent, and to dothat he needed someone beside him he could trust.Bruce Lee had difficulty understanding that not everyone shared his ambitions orabilities. He could be an impatient teacher and would show a move only once ortwice, so if you didn’t catch it, it was unlikely to be repeated. He thoughtthat if he could do it, so could anyone else. Taky Kimura was one of those whocouldn’t always keep up. He told Bruce that he was quitting, adding that it waseasy for the teacher, but not the student. Bruce replied that Taky had thetalent but refused to recognize it. As Taki explains: ‘I was working twice ashard as the other guys because I was older than them. One day I was looking outof the corner of my eye to see if I was making any impression on Bruce. Ofcourse he knew exactly what I was doing and I heard him say to one of theothers, “He’ll never make it.” That hurt me to the bone. But because I’d alwaysbeen a quitter in the past, it drove me to try that much harder and, even thoughI was clumsy, I think he saw that I was dedicated and sincere about what I wastying to do. After that he started to work with me, taking me aside and showingme lots of extra things. The next thing I knew, he was grooming me to be hisassistant.’As Bruce’s time at Edison was coming to an end, he reckoned that a car of hisown would make a perfect graduation present to himself. During the last weeks ofterm, LeRoy Garcia gave Bruce driving lessons and was astonished that Bruce, whowas so skilled and coordinated in kung fu, was the complete opposite when itcame to driving. Even so, he passed his driving test and on 2 December 1960 hegraduated from Edison Tech with the certified high school diploma that wouldgain him entry to the University of Washington the following March. Hecelebrated by spending $100 on a beaten-up white Chevrolet Corvair.In January 1961, after watching local programming on KCTS Channel 9 publictelevision, Bruce Lee decided to ring the station with a view to presenting akung fu demonstration. The station had already had a call from another kung futeacher, Fook Young, and the producers suggested a collaboration. Bruce rangFook and they discussed a presentation. Bruce then began rehearsing the seniorstudents and contacted a local seamstress, Mrs Mei Wong, to sew some Chinesekung fu uniforms for him.By now Bruce had also made inroads into more formal teaching by holding classesat a community gym on Yesler Terrace. He designed a flyer and had severalhundred mimeographed at the centre advertising that a martial arts demonstrationwas scheduled there for 14 February. It would be a dummy run for the TVpresentation, starting with some wing chun forms, then some sticking hands,followed by the practical application of some of the techniques. On the eveningaround thirty people turned up. Only one of them seemed unimpressed with theperformance, a Japanese karate black belt named Uechi – a fellow student atEdison who objected to Bruce’s continual downgrading of karate – who continuallyinterrupted Bruce with his own opinions on the subject.The following week Bruce and his students put on their display at the TVstation, and a week later the station manager invited them to do a short series,which was filmed over three separate occasions. As a result of the publicity araft of new students enrolled, bringing in fees of a hundred dollars a month,three times what Bruce was making at Ruby’s restaurant. Bruce wrote to Yip Manin Hong Kong saying that he was spreading the word about wing chun andexplaining that he was still trying to get someone to send him a wooden practicedummy.In March 1961, Bruce enrolled at the University of Washington and found he hadto balance going to classes with doing homework, teaching his own classes andworking at the restaurant. At the university, Bruce initially enrolled insubjects that were compulsory or of immediate practical use to him, such asEnglish, American History, Mathematics and Humanities. But with a strongintuition of where he was now heading, optional courses that attracted him werein Theatre Speech and Speech Improvement. Over the years that he would spend atthe university, he would also take courses in Drawing, Composition, SocialDance, Chinese Philosophy, Chinese Language, the Far East in the Modern World,General Psychology, the Psychology of Adjustment, Personal Health, BusinessManagement and Leadership. He also began to seek out self-help books on thedevelopment of potential, ‘making luck’ and positive thinking.Bruce had only been at the university a matter of weeks when he had a chanceencounter on the library stairs with the karate man Uechi, who’d also movedthere from Edison. He shoved Bruce and called him a show-off.‘You want to fight me, man?’ Bruce replied.‘Yeah,’ retorted Uechi. ‘You need a lesson! Let’s do it in the main gym soeveryone can see you get your ass kicked.’‘No. You want to fight me, we’ll do it on my terms,’ said Bruce. ‘We’ll fight atthe YMCA handball court on Sunday night, six o’clock.’At the appointed time they both turned up, along with a small crowd ofspectators filled with anticipation.‘You challenged me, right?’ Bruce asked Uechi.‘Yeah.’‘That’s all I wanted to know.’Jesse Glover was appointed referee and makeshift rules were established. Therewould be three rounds of two minutes. But first Uechi disappeared for tenminutes to go and change into his traditional white karate gi with its blackbelt. Bruce was in his street clothes, since he wasn’t there to represent anyparticular style of fighting.Uechi returned, went through a warm-up ritual of snapping out a few punches andthen looked at Bruce.‘Are you ready?’Jesse broke the following silence with the instruction to start. For a fewseconds the two fighters circled cautiously. Bruce took up a wing chun stance.Uechi adopted a deep karate forward stance, then switched to a cat stance andsnapped out a front kick to Bruce’s groin. Bruce parried the kick and instantlyclosed in with a rapid series of straight punches before Uechi could get anycounters going. Uechi never managed to land another blow as Bruce drove him tothe ground. As he fell to his knees, Bruce kicked him in the face and JesseGlover ran in to stop the fight. The karate man reappeared a week later, tellinghis friends that he’d been involved in a minor car accident.Taky Kimura recounts, ‘It lasted about ten seconds. Bruce was quite generousabout the whole business. Rather than embarrass the man in front of his friends,he just let it go at that. Later, the guy became a pupil. Bruce showed a lot ofclass; he didn’t hold a grudge, he let him in and just moved on.’By June 1961, Bruce was making plans to open a formal school and began lookingaround Chinatown for suitable premises. After several attempts he realized theonly option was to accept a dilapidated but affordable basement which could bespruced up. He designed a red and gold yin-yang emblem, painted it on a posterboard and put it up in the entrance. He paid the thirty-five dollars for abusiness licence and the first Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute opened.In the meantime, Bruce’s relationship with Amy had reached a complete impasse.Bruce asked Taky’s advice, telling Taky he was thinking of proposing to Amy butwasn’t sure that she’d accept. ‘If it’s meant to be, it’ll happen naturally,’said Taky."},{"pageContent":" 6THE CIRCLE GROWSAt the end of Bruce Lee’s first university term, his grades averaged B plus. Inthe summer recess the institute continued with its public demonstrations andcore students noticed that Lee’s teaching was changing yet again. There were nowmore praying mantis-like techniques, more kicks and other longer-rangestrategies, as well as more calisthenics.When the new term started, one of Bruce’s favourite haunts became the campuslibrary, in particular the Chinese philosophy section, where he made page afterpage of notes on the teachings of Confucius, Sun Tzu, Lao Tzu and other greatscholars and prophets. Soon various maxims and aphorisms written on cardsstarted to appear pinned around the walls of the institute. ‘Adaptation is likethe immediacy of the shadow adjusting itself to the moving body,’ read one.‘He was a unique young man,’ says Taky. ‘He could turn his personality from onesegment to another. One minute he would be telling us a raunchy joke, the nexthe would be talking about Zen and Taoism. He was very flexible and could changedepending on who he was talking to.’‘Just as in his childhood, Bruce was still fond of practical jokes,’ Doug Palmerrecalls. ‘One of the guys in the class was an optometrist and Bruce had a wholebunch of contact lenses made. One pair had red veins in them, and he used to putthem in and goof around. He would stumble into a restaurant and be led up to atable by one of us, then fumble for a menu, pass his hands across the page andstart ordering in Chinese while one of us interpreted.’Bruce celebrated his twenty-first birthday in November 1961 with nothingstronger than root beer. Christmas that year came a week early for him as thelong-awaited wooden dummy finally arrived from Hong Kong. He wasted no time inunpacking it and soon had it assembled in the small back yard below his room atRuby Chow’s. Now he could make up for lost time, practising blocking andstriking its hard wooden limbs and trunk. By the end of the day, Bruce decidedthat he would keep this new piece of equipment a secret, knowing that it wouldhelp him regain his edge. After working with it for a while, he nicknamed thedummy Bodhidharma.One humid May evening in 1962, while the Seattle World’s Fair was in full swing,Bruce was visited in his basement school by a group of people led by Wally Jay,who introduced himself as a judo and ju-jitsu instructor from Almeda,California. Jay said he and his students were on a goodwill tour of judo clubsin the northwest and he had dropped in on Bruce because the mother of one of hisstudents had once taken cha-cha lessons from him. ‘It wasn’t hard to find you,’said Wally. ‘Your reputation is growing; everyone seems to know who you are.’ Abroad smile crossed Bruce’s face.Like Wally Jay, Bruce had a strong intuition of when someone knew what they weretalking about through their technical vocabulary and body language and both soonrecognized each other’s authenticity. Wally volunteered one of his students, whohappened to be his most senior student and the biggest and strongest among them,to perform a demonstration with Bruce. They faced off and Bruce beckoned thestudent forward. As fast as the barrage of attacks came, Bruce reactedinstinctively and immediately with multiple blocks and counterattacks. The judoman’s strikes had travelled barely halfway to their target before they weredeflected.Wally was impressed, realizing that Bruce was just playing and could have easilyfinished the student off. Diplomatically, Wally eased any tension by shiftingthe subject to talk of the rest of his tour, but Bruce had noticed somethingChinese about Wally’s features and interrupted to ask about his ancestry. Wallywas quick to confirm Bruce’s observations and the conversation took a newdirection. They agreed that most Westerners still thought the Chinese were goodat ping pong, and that was about it. As Wally left it was clear that afriendship had begun.That weekend Bruce called Amy and told her about this meeting, but she wasn’tinterested in judo, ju-jitsu or kung fu. When Bruce asked her if she’d like tovisit the World’s Fair and the Space Needle she turned the idea down flat. Shekept bringing up the subject of Bruce’s car.‘What’s wrong with my car?’ he asked.‘Don’t you think you should get a newer one?’ she said.Amy was letting him know that his old Corvair, with its dents and fadedpaintwork, was not the kind of car she intended to be seen in. If success wasmeasured that way, Bruce had to admit he still had some way to travel.James Lee – the Oakland kung fu teacher whose brother Bob had taken a dancinglesson from Bruce – had a friend named Allen Joe who happened to be travellingto Seattle for the World’s Fair. ‘Since you’re going,’ said James, ‘why don’tyou check him out?’ Allen Joe tracked Bruce Lee down to Ruby Chow’s restaurant.He waited till late in the evening and was sitting there drinking a Scotch whenBruce showed up dressed ‘real sharp’. Bruce was feeling good, having justreceived a letter containing $150 from his mother in Kowloon.Allen Joe mentioned James Lee and he and Bruce began talking kung fu, eventuallymoving to the back lot where Bruce showed him a practice form on the new woodentraining dummy. Not to be outdone, Allen showed Bruce his classical moves.Without smiling, Bruce told him they were no good and to try them on him. Forthe best part of an hour Allen tried every move he could on Bruce but ended up‘flying all over the place’. ‘I was really impressed,’ said Allen Joe. ‘He wasso smooth that everything I had learned seemed stiff and clumsy in comparison.’At four in the morning they parted on good terms.Bruce now decided to keep one Sunday free exclusively for Amy. During theirSunday dinner at the Bush Garden, he was convinced that this was the right timeto propose to her. Holding Amy’s hands across the table he told her how much shemeant to him, and how he wanted her to be the person behind him, ensuring hissuccess, then he asked her to marry him. The reaction wasn’t the one he washoping for. In fact, she was aghast. She replied that this was the last thingshe wanted, but Bruce kept trying to convince her. He pictured himself as thehead of a chain of kung fu schools, independent and wealthy, with Amy there toshare it all. Choosing her words carefully, she said that they were too alikeever to be married and that she didn’t want to sacrifice her own ambitions,which were just as important to her.At the group’s next Sunday gathering at the Hong Kong café in Chinatown, Amy wasnoticeably absent. It seems Bruce had taken her words to heart, though, becauseat the end of a nine-course meal he announced that he was getting rid of the oldCorvair and treating himself to a new car as a birthday present to himself, thenafter dinner he took everyone to the Varsity Theatre to see The Seven Samurai.The following weekend Bruce sold the Corvair for $50, which he put towards the$625 he paid for a 1957 Ford Fairlane, bought from a small ad in the SeattleTimes. The car ran well, had no dents and the paintwork was clean, and it amusedhim that the black and white colour scheme made it look like a Seattle Policecar. He thought that even if it wasn’t good enough for Amy, there would beplenty of co-eds on the campus who wouldn’t mind being driven around in it.Just as Yip Man had done, Bruce introduced a ranking structure to the institute.Because of Taky’s help and sincerity Bruce promoted him to assistant instructorand gave him the rank of si hing, meaning ‘older brother’. There were now aboutfifty students; some were regulars and some only showed up from time to time,but all were paying customers and this kept him solvent.In addition Bruce was now getting more and more offers to performdemonstrations, assisted by Taky, Jesse and the other seniors.‘I was with Bruce at some of his demos and he would put away some big guys,’says Taky. ‘But his strength wasn’t plain brawn. He used to tell us this storyabout an old lady whose house caught on fire. Her most precious possession was apiano which was on one of the upper floors. Without stopping to think about howshe was going to do it, she carried the piano out of the house to safety. Later,it took four men to lift it. Bruce could call up and harness that kind of energyat will. His power came from a tremendous base of internal energy, which he knewhow to bring out.Jesse Glover explains, ‘What Bruce could readily demonstrate at the drop of ahat was based on a great many factors other people didn’t possess. Few peoplehad the physical background to make Bruce’s ideas work. What Bruce presented tothe public was only the tip of the iceberg. One of the requirements for learningthese arts is intensive practice spread over the appropriate time period. Youcan’t learn them overnight and you can’t learn them without effort. In order tosuccessfully use any of Bruce’s ideas, you had to develop more than a little ofBruce’s skill.‘There were several factors that made Bruce the way he was. First was hisability to take something complex and render it down to its basic essence.Second was his natural speed and ability to imitate any movement he saw, even ifit was only once. Third was the motivation that drove him to higher levels; thefear of being beaten and the desire to be the best – the fear that he might meetsomeone with his own ability but who was bigger and stronger – and the fact thatif he was the best, such a thing couldn’t happen.‘During the first two years that I knew him, Bruce Lee was a split individualwho could rave about the attributes of various martial arts during oneconversation, only to put them down in another. During this period in the early1960s, Bruce travelled around California and the West Coast, as far as Canada,to look at and talk to kung fu masters. Whenever they permitted him to watch orshowed him some technique, Bruce quickly saw how he could make them moreefficient, something that seldom endeared him to the host. A series of theseencounters began to make him think that much of what was being taught wasineffective.‘Bear in mind that during this period Bruce was training forty or more hours aweek. He was approaching his peak time of development and his actions reflectedthe great gains he was making. The better he became, the less regard he had fortradition and he said so whenever he had a platform to speak from, and he couldback his words with actions.’Bruce Lee made an equally powerful impression on one of the students of GarfieldHigh School, where he was an occasional guest lecturer. He arrived one day,looking cool with Amy Sanbo on his arm, to give a talk on Chinese philosophy. Hedidn’t even notice Linda Emery, an athletic girl of seventeen, but she was takenenough to ask the girl beside her who he was. Her friend, a Chinese-Americangirl named Sue Ann Kay, replied that Bruce was the guy who was teaching her kungfu.During one busy evening training session Taky took a call from James Lee inOakland. Allen Joe had given an impressive report on Bruce and James now askedif Bruce would like to come down to Oakland and teach a few classes. A week orso later Bruce set off. He had difficulty reading the American roadmaps – hewondered if his 20/400 vision might be getting even worse – and wouldoccasionally get lost on the coast road, but after nearly sixteen hours and 810miles, the ‘police car’ arrived in Oakland.Bruce eventually found James Lee’s house and was made welcome. Naturally enough,all conversation was about martial arts and Bruce discovered that James was theauthor of several books on the fighting arts of the Orient, karate and kung fu.Bruce asked why he’d chosen to spell it ‘kung fu’ rather than the traditionalCantonese ‘gung fu’. James replied that since most Americans didn’t know Chinesepronunciation he felt that his spelling would make it more accessible andmarketable in the US. Bruce was most interested in James’s Modern Kung Fu: IronPoison Hand Training, which explained methods for developing stronger hands. Thefollowing morning James invited Bruce to see his garage, which was full of allkinds of innovative training equipment he’d welded together himself. Every sortof spring-loaded apparatus imaginable was mounted on the walls and beams of thegarage.Bruce told James how impressed he was that a Chinese-American like himself hadbecome so physically developed, as normally Chinese men had slender frames andlittle muscle bulk to work with. James replied that body conditioning was onlyhalf of it, proper diet and nutrition were just as important. He explained thatmuscles, when exercised, needed to be taken to the point where they actuallytore or shredded, and protein was needed for their rebuilding and growth. But healso added that, once started, such a regimen had to last a lifetime. On thatunderstanding James offered to help Bruce, saying that he could probablyincrease his 135 pounds to 150 or maybe 160 pounds, without sacrificing anyspeed or flexibility with the increase in bulk. However, he didn’t want him toget so obsessed with the idea that he was tempted to take chemicals or steroids.James warned him never to get into that stuff unless he wanted testosteroneimbalances, liver ailments, kidney failure and the like. ‘It will kill you witha very slow, agonizing death,’ he warned.As Bruce returned to Seattle, he smiled to himself. He sensed a kindred spiritin James, who he felt as if he’d known all of his life. Over the years, it wasthe kind of deep friendship he would forge with very few."},{"pageContent":" 7YIN YANGDuring the long drive back to Seattle, Bruce worked out the format for a book heintended to produce in collaboration with James Lee. There would be somethingabout the history and philosophy of kung fu, along with photographs of varioustechniques, featuring himself with his senior students. As soon as he got toSeattle, he drove straight round to the institute to start work on it.When Taky arrived that evening Bruce had already compiled a stack of notes.Bruce told Taky of his plans to write a book that would serve as an introductionto his art for Americans who weren’t familiar with kung fu in general,explaining that he couldn’t go too deeply into things without losing the reader.Even so, he wanted to include something about the esoteric background to hisart.Bruce recalled how Yip Man had once told him, ‘Instead of opposing force withforce, a kung fu man defeats his opponent by accepting his flow of energy andborrowing his force. In order to reconcile oneself to the changing movement ofthe opponent, a kung fu man should first understand the true meaning of yinyang.’Now that Bruce was older and had experienced that philosophy directly at thehands of the praying-mantis master Gin Foon Mark in New York, he reasoned thatthe philosophy of the yin yang symbol, which was the symbol of his institute,would be the best place to begin. By early November he had settled on astructure for the book, and a title: Chinese Gung Fu: The Philosophical Art ofSelf-Defense. Unusually for him, he decided to stick with the traditional ‘gungfu’ rather than the modern variant ‘kung fu’ as he felt that this would add anauthentic edge. On his daily visits to the University of Washington campuslibrary, Bruce began to compile his notes about the nature of yin and yang.Every phenomenon in the world can be explained by the interaction of two primalforces termed yin and yang. Yang represents the creative masculine element –heat, light, sound, activity, heaven, infinity and so on – while yin representsthe receptive feminine element – coolness, darkness, stillness, earth and thefinite. Yin and yang are not concrete realities but a way of representing theflow and flux of energy that lies behind every process in existence.Nothing is yin or yang except in relation to other things or processes. They arerelative forces. For example: an iron ball is yang compared to a rubber ball,which would be yin. But a rubber ball would be yang compared to a ball ofbutter. And a ball of butter would be yang compared to a raindrop, and so on.Yin and yang are neither cause nor effect. When I say heat makes me perspire,the heat and the perspiring are just parts of one process in which one could notexist without the other, like light and shadow or sound and echo. Theinteraction of yin and yang is also seen in the way a bicycle is made to work.Both pedals cannot be pushed at the same time: one has to be pushed while theother is released, then vice versa.This concept of two complementary forces is used to explain the way in whichnature creates the sustaining energy of all existence, the breath of life, orchi. This can be understood if one imagines combining fire (yang) and water(yin) to produce steam. The resulting vapour is almost invisible, but whencontained and channelled it has great force. The Chinese symbol for chi is aniron pot of hot rice whose steam is lifting up the heavy lid.Chi permeates the entire universe; it is the vital energy of every living being.In terms of the human body, it is the flow of energy governing muscularmovement, the process of breathing, the regulation of the heartbeat, thefunctioning of the nervous system, in short, all physical, mental and emotionalprocesses. What Western medicine attributes to separate circulatory, endocrine,digestive, muscular and nervous systems, the Chinese have traditionally viewedas interrelating, and an understanding of the flow of chi is the basis of allthe Taoist arts, including the martial arts, philosophy and medicine.In martial arts, the moment of stillness before the arm punches is yin, but asthe arm shoots out to strike, it becomes yang. In the wing chun trainingexercise of chi sao (or ‘sticking hands’) the student has to apply the sameprinciples of pressure and release that are used to power a bicycle. Inattempting to feel the force and intention of his opponent’s moves so as toneutralize or counter them, the arms must be soft and sensitive enough toregister small changes without being limp, but firm and resilient enough towithstand pressure without being rigid. As the attacks and counters flow, onlythe one who continues to change and adapt spontaneously, without thought andeffort, will prevail.In a neatly typed fifteen-page essay that Bruce Lee compiled in the universitylibrary, he wrote:The application of the principles of yin and yang in gung fu are expressed asthe law of harmony. One should be in harmony with, not rebelling against, thestrength and force of the opposition. When A uses strength (yang) on B, B mustnot resist him back with strength, but instead yield to him with softness (yin)and lead him in the direction of his own force. When A’s force reaches itslimits the yang will change to yin and B can then take him in this unguardedmoment and attack with force (yang).In effect, this strategy is very much like the children’s game, stone, scissorsand paper. If A presents ‘stone’, then B wraps it in ‘paper’. If A present‘paper’ then B cuts it with ‘scissors’. If A presents ‘scissors’ then B jamsthem with ‘stone’. The kung fu man flows into the appropriate moves as quicklyand naturally as water filling a pot, as instinctively as the reflex of removinga hand from a hot stove, or as automatically as the way we sign our own name.Later, the skill and sensitivity developed allow the student instinctively tocounter his opponent’s moves at the speed of reflex action.At a certain point in training this sensitivity may even move beyond a purelyphysical skill to become a psychic faculty, in which you may also becomesensitive to the opponent’s emotions and thoughts to such a degree that youexperience his intention to attack at the same time as he does, or even before.After conferring with James Lee in Oakland, Bruce set out to do the necessarywork on the layout and photographs, which he planned to shoot in Ruby Chow’sparking lot, explaining that he and his colleagues would wear traditional jingmo gung fu uniforms; Bruce would wear a black one and his student would weargrey. James was surprised by the fact that Bruce, who was always progressive inhis approach, had decided to do this, but nevertheless suggested they met upagain at the Christmas break to put the finishing touches to everything. Brucewas already planning a trip back to Hong Kong the following summer to researchan even more ambitious follow-up project: The Tao of Chinese Gung Fu.On his second trip to Oakland over Thanksgiving, Bruce and James’s time togetherwas spent working on the book and training. Bruce told James that there wereessentials that had to be understood before he could begin the journey tomastery, elements such as guarding the body’s centre line – an imaginary linerunning through the core of the head and torso – and the principle of theimmovable elbow. Bruce confessed that what he knew of the more advanced forms ofwing chun he had not learned from Yip Man, who kept his students on the basicsfor years, but from the information he’d managed to prise out of senior studentslike William Cheung, as well as through spying on advanced classes. ‘Anyway,’ headded, ‘the hardest part of learning is actually learning how to learn it. Onceyou can concentrate your mental energies, it’s a piece of cake.’In return James initiated Bruce into techniques for breaking wooden boards withhis bare hand – ‘One hundred miles an hour in, one hundred and ten miles an hourout!’ said James – despite the fact that Bruce had always claimed he wasunimpressed by such things.James wrote a short introductory section for Bruce’s book, which included theseremarks:I was really impressed when in friendly sparring matches with Mr. Bruce Lee, Icouldn’t penetrate or land a telling blow or kick, even when he was blindfolded,once his hands are ‘sticking’ to mine. I have paid the Mr. Bruce Lee a sincerecompliment by changing all of my gung fu techniques to his methods. When hedemonstrated his type of striking, which is based on inner energy, I found itmuch more powerful than the power I had developed from Iron Hand training. Thesuperiority of his gung fu is more refined and effective than that which I havelearned in all my past years. Since his striking power is generated from thewaist and mind, I maintain that the power to break bricks is not the true testof actual application of energy in real combat.Aside from the philosophical discourses in his book, Bruce included theories oncombat that were just as direct:Fighting is not for sport, it’s for real. When someone is trying to roll youover like truck, you don’t have time to play around. You’ve got to hit and runbefore the cops arrive . . . Speed is more important than power . . . It’s aboutbeing first with the most that wins . . . If the opponent can’t see you, hecan’t hit you. And if he can’t hit you, he can’t hurt you . . . The first moveshould be a succession of rapid-fire strikes to the eyes.On one free evening during his stay Bruce asked James to drive him into SanFrancisco because he wanted to see the Jackson Street Hospital where he’d beenborn. And on the evening of Bruce’s birthday, James and his wife Katherinearranged a surprise party for him at the Lantern Chinese restaurant with aspecially made cake decorated with a yin yang symbol and twenty-two candles.Among the guests were Wally Jay and Allen Joe. The following day, as Bruce madeready to leave, James handed him several bottles of dit da jow hand-conditioningmedicine as an early Christmas gift.On 17 December Bruce got the early Christmas present he wanted more thananything, with the news that 1,500 copies of his book were printed, bound andboxed in Oakland. Bruce couldn’t wait for them to be shipped up to Seattle, andat midnight, immediately after work, he drove straight down to James Lee’s,leaving an irate Ruby Chow with a large gap in her busy Christmas work rota.On the drive Bruce reflected on how his parents had wanted him to succeed in aworld where a good education meant everything. But he also reasoned that evenwith a degree, he would still want to be doing the things he was doing, and hecould certainly do that without the distraction of working at Chow’s, along withall the homework assignments and the newspaper job eating into his teachingtime. He began thinking that his studies and his job might have to take secondplace, and that nothing should stand in the way of his martial arts goals."},{"pageContent":" 8SUMMER IN HONG KONGIn the summer of 1963, Bruce Lee was planning a trip back to Hong Kong andhoping to tell his family that he and Amy Sanbo were to be married. In the threeyears that he and Amy had been dating Bruce had proposed and been turned downseveral times. He made one final attempt, hoping to clinch it by offering her aring that had once belonged to his grandmother. Bruce knew that Amy had beenoffered a job in New York, so he was pushing her into marrying him or turninghim down for good. Amy turned him down for the last time and then disappearedfrom his life. For a while he tried unsuccessfully to locate her.At the same time Bruce got a letter from the draft board and they were not atall keen to let him leave the country where his American citizenship had madehim eligible for military service. In the end Bruce asked his English professorMargaret Walters to write a character reference, assuring the draft board thathe was an honourable man. Although his life in the States had been shadowed bythe disappointment of Amy walking out, Bruce had no intention of leaving itsshores for good.That summer, the Lee household in Nathan Road consisted of Bruce’s mother andfather, his sister Agnes, brother Robert, a cousin, an aunt, a servant, dogs,fish . . . and the chicken living on the veranda. Bruce’s friend and studentDoug Palmer had studied Chinese at college and he jumped at the chance whenBruce invited him to come along on the visit home. One evening, as the familysat around the table, Doug Palmer was introduced to the subtleties of thelanguage.In his extensive notes written during this trip, Palmer recalls:Cantonese, the Chinese dialect predominant in Hong Kong, is a tonal language.Sounds which are otherwise identical can have a radically different meaning witha different tone. By then, I could speak Mandarin, which has four basic tones,reasonably well. But Cantonese has seven and, for me, the differences weresometimes impossible to hear.One night, the family sat around the dining table playing a simple game whichconsisted of rolling a die with the figure of a different animal on each face.Whoever was quickest to yell out the correct animal after the die was rolledadvanced his marker. One of the animals was a shrimp, pronounced ‘haai’ in a lowtone. In the excitement of the game my voice would rise and I found myselfshouting ‘hai’ with an even higher pitch every time the shrimp was rolled. Theladies of the household thought this was most amusing and giggled each time.Finally, Bruce took me aside to explain the difference in tone between the wordfor ‘shrimp’ and the word for ‘cunt’.Bruce and Doug found no shortage of things to do that summer. They swam at thebeach, went to the movies, visited amusement parks, ate in restaurants or simplysoaked up the atmosphere and energy of the bustling streets. Bruce also got DougPalmer involved in his practical jokes. One of his targets was the Hong Kongpolice, who were quite corrupt at the time and, along with the British soldiers,were the people Bruce disliked most. Bruce selected a Chinese policeman wearinga red bar on one of his sleeves, signifying that he spoke rudimentary English.Doug recalls:Once we spotted one of the cops with a red bar, my job was to walk up to him andask if he could tell me the way to the Canton Theatre. Since there was no CantonTheatre, but there was a Canton Road, the cop would invariably ask, in heavilyaccented English, ‘Canton Road?’‘No!’ I’d say, I was supposed to meet a friend at the Canton Theatre and,thereupon, I would launch into a nonstop monologue of doubletalk.Each time the confused cop would repeat ‘Canton Road?’ I would give anotherburst of doubletalk.Finally, I would demand loudly, in Cantonese, ‘What the hell are you mumblingabout?’At that point, Bruce would stroll up helpfully and ask what the problem was. Iwould explain that I was looking for the Canton Theatre. Bruce would say that hewas going that way and would accompany me and we would walk off, leaving the copwith an even more confused look on his face.One night Bruce was returning home to Kowloon on the Star Ferry when two streetpunks goaded him. He endured their comments and ignored them, but after theferry docked, they continued to follow Bruce and insult him. Finally he spunround and snapped out a low straight kick to the nearest punk’s shin. The secondone quickly backed off. While Bruce left it at that and continued home. When heheard about the incident, Bruce’s cousin Frank, who was a few years older, shookhis head in disbelief and laughed: ‘A few years ago, he would have beaten themboth up.’Bruce also took delight in faking fights with Doug in front of a crowd ofonlookers:We practiced our routine: two roundhouse swings from me, which he blocked withhis forearms, then a stiff uppercut to my stomach, which I had to make sure I’dtightened in time. We would time it so that we’d emerge from an elevator,arguing loudly, then swing into our skit in front of the crowd waiting for theelevator.I’m not sure whether Bruce’s sense of humor was Chinese or uniquely his own. Heused to act like a geek and let a street punk goad him, then when the punkswung, Bruce would block it awkwardly and snap at the punk’s groin,incapacitating him with a blow that appeared to be an accident. As the punkrolled in pain, Bruce would cover his mouth with his hand and tittereffeminately, then walk off.‘A person can accept getting beaten by someone who is stronger or bigger than heis,’ Bruce would explain, ‘but if he thinks he’s been beaten by a fairy, he’llbe pissed off for the rest of his life.’While in Hong Kong, Bruce continued with his serious training and sought out YipMan, taking Doug along only to watch and cautioning him not to let on that heknew any kung fu.Although he had kicked over the traces in the States, teaching gung fu to anyonewho was interested, without regard to race and to the consternation of manypeople in Seattle’s Chinatown, he was not ready, out of respect for his teacher,to ‘come out of the closet’ in Hong Kong.Yip Man was a smiling man with a twinkle in his eyes, slight and getting on inyears, but still fit. He and Bruce would practice sticking hands in hisapartment at the top of a high-rise. There were no other students present, andthe two of them, in their undershirts, would go at it for long periods.‘We hung out together all that summer,’ says Palmer, ‘except when we had dates.’When Bruce’s childhood sweetheart, Pak Yan, heard that he was in Hong Kong, shecalled him. In the five years he’d been away she had been featured in onepicture after another. Now, she told him, she would soon begin work on a newfilm in which she was to play ‘a bad girl’. She wanted to know if Bruce would beable to help her prepare for the part. Over the next few weeks, he helped herprepare several times.Whether or not his father knew about Pak Yan, a week before Bruce was due toreturn to Seattle, Lee Hoi Cheun decided that Bruce, at the age of twenty-two,should be circumcised. Even more astonishingly, Bruce agreed, returning to theapartment one day walking carefully. He quickly changed from the tight pants henormally wore into a pair of loose-fitting traditional ones borrowed from hisfather. Each morning the purple organ was inspected until it had taken on a morenormal appearance. ‘I remember him hobbling about,’ chuckles Palmer. ‘If he’dknown how painful it was going to be, I think he would have had secondthoughts.’By the time Bruce Lee and Doug Palmer took off for the US, Bruce was able towalk normally again:On the way back we stopped in Tokyo for a couple of days, then again in Hawaii.Through a friend, Bruce was asked to give a demonstration at a gung fu school inHonolulu; by then he had completely recovered from his operation. At that time,the gung fu schools in Hawaii, as elsewhere, were still strictly Chinese, so itwas quite a surprise when I climbed on to the stage with Bruce to give ademonstration to fifty students and their teachers.Afterwards a number of people gathered around to ask questions. One of themasked if Bruce was teaching me gung fu. From the way he asked and, since fromthe demonstration it was obvious that I’d had some training, his implication wasclear: he considered it heresy that Bruce would be training a non-Chinese.The same fellow, with a cigarette dangling from his mouth, now approached Brucewith questions about his technique. He asked Bruce how he would block a frontkick and Bruce offered to demonstrate. The man kicked at groin level and Bruceblocked it with a slapping palm block, then resumed his explanation. The mankept his leg extended in the air, after the kick was blocked, and flicked hisfoot feebly after Bruce had withdrawn the block. ‘See,’ he said, ‘you were openthere.’Although Bruce was smoldering, he had become adept at handling this type ofperson without hurting them. He continued his explanation and offered todemonstrate a different block. The man obliged and threw a punch, but of course,this time Bruce did not withdraw after blocking it; he trapped it and followedwith a counter of his own, just slow enough to allow the fellow to block it withhis free hand. Bruce grabbed the second hand too, and tied up both of the man’sarms. The force and speed of the second pull was so great that the man’scigarette went flying from his mouth as he jerked forward. The whole time, Brucecontinued calmly explaining each move, his head turned to the growing audience,as he kept the man’s arms pinned and demonstrated several alternative moves.Then, satisfied, he let the man go.When Bruce returned to Seattle the US government had their own plans for him. Asa prelude to possible service in Vietnam, he was called to take a physical examfor the US draft board. Surprisingly, he was considered physically unacceptableto the Army due to an undescended testicle. Had he joined the Army he wouldprobably have been court-martialled within a week. Not only did he hate routineand regimentation, his temper was balanced on a hair-trigger. If Bruce Lee wasunsuitable for work as a waiter, he was hardly cut out to be a soldier."},{"pageContent":" 9LINDAIn the summer of 1963, while Bruce and his friend Doug Palmer were in Hong Kong,Linda Emery graduated and took a vacation job. In September she started at theuniversity while Bruce Lee began his junior year as a philosophy major. OneSunday, her friend Sue Ann Kay invited her along to her kung fu lesson. Theywent to the Chinatown basement where Bruce’s class was held. Although it was abare concrete room with a single lightbulb, the atmosphere was buoyant. Lindahad expected to make this a single visit, but she surprised herself by enjoyingthe class and becoming one of the regulars.Sunday afternoons were the social highlight of the week for the class. They wereusually spent in Chinatown, where Bruce would crack jokes throughout lunchbefore they moved on to a movie theatre, often to see a samurai film. On thejourney between the restaurant and the cinema Bruce would walk in front.Suddenly objects like an orange might come flying back at them, thrown by him.They learned to reach out and catch these without comment; it had to beinstinctive. During the film Bruce would analyse the action, pointing outmistakes in the way it had been filmed. Later he would quiz everyone to see ifthey’d been paying attention, asking about minute details in the film or aboutpeople who’d been in the restaurant earlier or even about the weather. Bruceused everything as an opportunity to teach his students to become more aware andto make them realize that they could be a lot more aware.Bruce asked the university for permission to use the men’s gym to givedemonstrations and these soon attracted more students. People began missingclasses to spend time in the Student Union building where Bruce showed kung fumoves, explained the philosophy behind them and cracked jokes in between. Atother times they would train outside on a grassy area lined with trees. Duringone afternoon session Bruce chased Linda Emery to one side and suggested dinnerwithout the others. Unlike Amy Sanbo, Linda Emery turned out to be the perfectdate: she listened attentively. As they sat in the Space Needle’s revolvingrestaurant with the lights of Seattle turning slowly below, Bruce overflowedwith his plans for the future.Bruce was still living at Ruby Chow’s and was feeling both stifled and restless.Taky suggested that they begin looking for bigger premises where they could allmeet and train. The students would continue to pay so he could support himselfand pay the rent. Bruce found a suitable place and in October 1963 he handedRuby Chow his notice and moved the Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute to 4750 UniversityWay, not far from the campus. The school occupied the entire ground floor of anapartment building, where showers were already installed. Bruce camped out in awindowless room at the back, sparsely furnished with things he’d brought backfrom his summer trip to Hong Kong. A school prospectus was printed, with Bruceoffering a martial arts method that was fast, efficient and economical, thoughhe warned that it could not be mastered overnight.Every evening Bruce and Linda would run back to his windowless room at the backof the institute and fumble around in the dark for the light switch; then Brucewould turn on the TV so that they could watch General Hospital, the soap-operathey’d both become hooked on. Afterwards they would most likely eat in theChinese restaurant across the street, where Bruce would eat beef in oyster sauceor, occasionally, shrimp in black bean sauce. Soon they were together constantlyand Linda’s school work began to suffer. Bruce would often do Linda’s homeworkfor her and could write an English essay with almost perfect grammar andspelling in no time at all. Unfortunately he wasn’t as much help when it came toLinda’s other pre-med subjects, chemistry and calculus, and she began fallingbehind on the ‘points’ she needed to graduate.Keeping her new relationship secret from her mother and stepfather, Linda Emeryspent most evenings with Bruce at the institute. Linda came from a whiteProtestant family, and while her mother could hardly object to her having Asianfriends in a school where over half the student population was black or Asian,she did draw the line at dating. Linda’s mother would certainly have had strongfeelings about the affair, but what was now obvious to Linda was that her ownfeelings had become even stronger.Towards the end of 1963, when Doug Palmer returned home to Seattle for theChristmas vacation, he accompanied Bruce Lee on one of his demonstrations, thistime at Garfield High School, where Palmer had graduated one year ahead ofLinda’s class. Here Bruce gave the first demonstration of the ‘one-inch’ punch.Palmer’s diary recalls:Garfield was a tough inner-city high school, over half black and Asian. Theclass that Bruce began speaking to had several football and basketball playersin it who lounged in their seats never having heard of kung fu. Bruce startedout by contrasting the karate-style punch with the wing chun punch. He thenconfided that there was a punch with even greater power which could be deliveredfrom a distance of a single inch. Some of the students were stirred from theirboredom to briefly register mild amusement at the idea. Bruce asked for avolunteer to demonstrate this one-inch punch on. While guys smirked at eachother, Bruce singled out the biggest kid, sprawled out across his chair at theback of the class, and asked him to step forward.The class perked up a little, giggling as Bruce stood dwarfed by his volunteer.Bruce placed his knuckles against the big guy’s chest and steadied himself.‘Wait a minute,’ said Bruce, suddenly. He then made a production out of findinga chair and placing it about five feet behind his stooge.‘OK,’ said Bruce, as he resumed his position. ‘Now we’re ready.’ This had thedesired effect: the students were now watching in anticipation. The big guyglanced back over his shoulder at the chair five feet behind him. Up till then,he’d been laid back about it: now that it looked as if he were going to be laidout, he was damned if he was going to let a skinny little Chinese guy make afool out of him. The big guy braced himself, one foot back. Bruce, the showman,kept up a constant patter, his arm extended and his fist touching the kid’schest. Suddenly, his arm shimmered, nothing more, and mouths fell open as thekid flew off his feet and into the waiting chair, knocking it over backwards ashe sprawled ass over kettle onto the floor. Bruce now had the attention of theclass.Bruce had continued to keep in touch with James Lee, and in June 1964 they beganmaking plans to open a branch of Bruce’s Jun Fan Institute in Oakland. By nowBruce had lost interest in completing his philosophy doctorate at university,and at the end of the term he sold his ‘police car’ and shipped his furniture toOakland. Linda drove Bruce to the airport, wondering how, or even if, she fittedin with his plans. Bruce told her he wanted to have some money behind him beforeeven thinking about marriage or a family.The air was thick and muggy in the Long Beach Sports Arena that July day in1964. The air conditioning wasn’t working and the crowd, who were there to watchthe annual International Karate Tournament, was restless after sitting throughhours of matches. Then Ed Parker, the sponsor of the event, went to themicrophone to introduce Bruce Lee, who was going to put on a demonstration ofthe little-known Chinese martial art of kung fu.Ed Parker recalls, ‘He was very broad-minded about things, very anti-classicalkung fu; he felt that they were all robots. So I told him that if he were tocome down to the tournament and demonstrate, people would have a bettercross-section of the martial arts world.’Wearing a simple black jing mo suit and slippers Bruce took to the floor. Justas he’d done with the students at Garfield, he drew the audience into hispresentation, which climaxed with the one-inch punch as his victim flew back andgasped for breath. Although they were impressive, Bruce was against simply doingtricks like this if they had no real point to them. The real purpose of theone-inch punch was to show that there’s a far more powerful way of strikingsomeone than simply using the strength of the arm and shoulder muscles. The morerelaxed the muscles are, the more energy can flow through the body; usingmuscular tensions to try to do the punch, or attempting to use brute force toknock someone over, only has the opposite effect.Competing in the black belt division of Ed Parker’s championships that day was aFilipino martial artist called Dan Inosanto. Apart from studying kenpo karatewith Parker, Inosanto also trained in the Filipino arts of escrima and kali.After the match he went to meet Bruce at his hotel room to exchange ideas andtechniques, but he was less than satisfied with the results of their shortsession.Dan continues to teach at his Academy in Marina del Rey, California, still runsevery day and looks as fit as he did twenty years ago. He recalls feelingcompletely flabbergasted: ‘He controlled me like a baby; I couldn’t do anythingwith him at all. He didn’t really have to use much force either; he just sort ofbody-controlled me. I’d lost to other people before, but not in the way I lostto him; he dominated the action completely, calling all the shots like it was agame. I couldn’t sleep that night. It seemed as though everything I’d done inthe past was obsolete. He countered everything I knew without really trying. Itwas very frustrating.’After Ed Parker’s karate tournament Bruce Lee and Dan Inosanto spent a lot oftime together, sometimes just walking and talking or exploring old bookstores.Inosanto took over Taky Kimura’s role and helped Bruce give demonstrations inthe San Francisco area. These shows followed a familiar format, includinglightning-fast finger jabs, kicks, punches that stopped within a whisker oftheir target, Bruce testing his reflexes against a challenger, doing thumbpush-ups or board-breaking.Dan spent four days taking falls and punches for Bruce in demonstrations at theSing Lee Theatre in Los Angeles, then in the evenings, at the Statler Hilton,Bruce taught him some of his fighting method, what Inosanto called ‘adevastatingly improved version of wing chun’.While Bruce was in Oakland he and Linda wrote to each other regularly, withLinda using a post office box so that her mother wouldn’t find the letters. SoonLinda had a bit of news for Bruce that meant marriage was on the cards soonerrather than later. Facing a karate black belt was one thing, but facing Linda’smother was quite another and Bruce wondered just how he was going to deal withhis future mother-in-law. In the end the formidable fighting machine suggestedthey get married first, make a tactical retreat to Oakland and then call Linda’smother with the news.On 12 August 1964, Bruce returned to Seattle with a wedding ring lent to him byJames Lee’s wife, Katherine. Unfortunately, after applying for the licence atthe County courthouse, the details of the forthcoming wedding were published inthe local newspaper, as required by law, and when Linda’s aunt saw theannouncement she phoned Linda’s mother to ask what had happened to herinvitation. The immediate family was rallied in a show of strength designed topressurize the couple into calling it off, but Bruce met them and, with economyand directness, told them, ‘I want to marry your daughter. By the way, I’mChinese.’After the revelation that she was soon to become a grandmother, Linda’s motherstarted making quick arrangements with the minister at the SeattleCongregational Church. Taky Kimura was the best man – ‘the only person outsidethe family to be invited,’ he recalls proudly – while Linda’s mother andgrandmother gave her away (Linda’s father had died when she was five years old).It was all so rushed that Bruce had to rent a suit for the ceremony, Lindadidn’t have a wedding dress and nobody thought to hire a photographer. ‘He couldat least have bought flowers,’ sighed Linda’s mother."},{"pageContent":" 10THE OAKLAND YEARSWhen someone once asked Bruce what the secret of happiness was he replied, ‘Getyourself a nondescript little place where you can work out with your buddies.’Although the years that Bruce Lee spent in Seattle and Oakland are oftenpresented as little more than footnotes in his rise to stardom, they not onlyhad a substantial impact on the man he would become, he later acknowledged thatthey were the happiest years of his life.In the autumn of 1964, Bruce and Linda moved into James Lee’s home at 3039Monticello Avenue in the Maxwell Park area of Oakland. Soon after, James’s wifeKatherine finally succumbed to cancer, leaving him with a daughter, Karena,twelve, and son Greglon, eleven (who had been named after James’s favouriteactors: Gregory Peck and Marlon Brando). Soon Bruce, Linda, James, Greglon andKarena were living as one extended family, just as Bruce himself had done as achild in Hong Kong with various cousins and unofficially adopted siblings.A dishevelled man with iron-hard hands, James Yimm Lee was twenty years olderthan Bruce and a former state weightlifting champion, amateur boxer and judobrown belt who now worked as a welder while teaching kung fu part time. He wasalso one of the few people in the US with any knowledge of the Chinese martialarts. He had trained for years in traditional kung fu but had becomedissatisfied with its set patterns and lack of practical training, so haddeveloped his own informal style. It was natural that James Lee realized whatBruce had to offer. Indeed, James said he learned more in the short period afterthey’d first met than he had in all his former training, because Bruce didn’tteach obsolete routines, just the essence of self-defence in situations thatweren’t prearranged.James and Bruce became partners and opened the second branch of the Jun Fan GungFu Institute on 4157 Broadway in Oakland. There were few students at first butTaky Kimura subsidized their income by insisting they receive all the takingsfrom the school in Seattle. Neither of Bruce’s schools was ever conceived as anout-and-out commercial venture. Bruce wasn’t just trying to attract as manypaying customers as possible; he wanted students who showed both ability andcommitment. What he had to offer had to be taught on a one-to-one basis; itwasn’t simply a matter of lining up students and rehearsing moves. Bruce neededto understand each student’s particular physical make-up, temperament andattitude. Each student had to be developed in a different way. Dan Inosanto, forexample, discovered that in order to progress further he first needed to freehimself from mental tension.For a while Bruce succeeded in his hope of avoiding the kind of conflict he’dhad with the students of other martial arts schools in Hong Kong. Rule nine ofthe institute called for discretion when explaining the school’s trainingmethods to others, so as not to stir up ill feeling and rivalry with otherschools. Ironically, the first trouble came early in 1965 from a Chinese martialarts instructor just across the Bay in San Francisco.Wong Jak Man had recently arrived from Hong Kong, to teach kung fu. Seeking tomake a name for himself he presented Bruce with a written challenge to fight,with the loser having to close his school. Behind the challenge lay thetraditional martial arts community’s objection to Bruce teaching their secretsto Westerners who, as they saw it, already had the natural advantage of size andstrength. Wong and several colleagues turned up for the appointed fight with along list of rules for the contest: no eye jabs, no groin kicks and so on. Brucewas incensed by this and became so eager to meet the challenge that Wong quicklysuggested a more formal sparring match to decide the issue. But Bruce would havenone of this and, unable to back down in front of his colleagues, Wong had nochoice but to see it through.According to reports from onlookers the fight was anything but smooth, fast orefficient. After a scrappy exchange, Wong turned to run, then his entouragetried to step in but were intercepted by James Lee. Bruce went after Wong,punching him on the back of the head, but was unable to land a finishing shot.In the end Bruce turned the delegation off the premises and they left withoutanother word.Bruce later told Dan Inosanto, ‘I chased him and, like a fool, kept punching hishead and back; my fists were already swelling from his hard head. Then I didsomething I’d never done before: I put my arm around his neck and knocked him onhis ass. I kept whacking him as he lay on the floor until he gave up. I was sotired I could hardly punch him.’Linda later found Bruce cooling off on the back porch, looking despondent andanything but satisfied with his victory. Bruce was deeply annoyed that whatshould have taken a few seconds had taken over three minutes, leaving him windedand facing the fact that he was in less than optimum condition. As a result,Bruce began to examine both his fighting and his training methods. Encouraged byJames Lee, he also began an intensive programme of physical conditioning. Hestarted every day with an early morning run of several miles, often with Bobo,the Great Dane he’d named after his childhood pet, the Alsatian Bobby. ForBruce, running was a kind of meditation, an opportunity to let things flow.Houses, cars and trees passed along just like his thoughts, feelings andsensations. After lunch, there was another run or an hour on the exercise bike.Bruce’s conditioning exercises centred mainly on the abdomen, using thetried-and-tested boxing method of having a heavy medicine ball thrown at hismid-section, along with sit-ups and leg raises. As his new approach took shape,he lost no time in criticizing the old guard: ‘There are lots of guys around theworld that are lazy. They have big fat guts. They talk about chi power thingsthey can do, but don’t believe it.’James also started Bruce on weight training. At first he did reverse curls allday to develop his forearms but once he’d seen how it might add strength to hisspeed he bought a full set of weights and used them consistently.William Cheung explains how Bruce was able to build his muscular strengththrough weight training, without sacrificing speed: ‘Back in the 1950s, theChinese martial artists were very conservative and knew that weight trainingwould slow them down. But Bruce found a way to beat it. He would start hisprogramme with heavy weights and low repetitions, then reduce the weight as heincreased the repetitions. He continued to do this until the repetitions and thespeed peaked.’Dan Inosanto also describes Bruce shadow-boxing with small weights in his handsdoing a hundred punches per series, using 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10-pound weights andthen reversing the series back to one. This also had the effect of buildingstrength on the way up and developing speed on the way down. Ted Wong can recallBruce using this heavy-light principle working up to 160-pound bench presses onhis heavy days, then doing only the last three inches of the movement at a muchlighter weight on his light days. In this way, Bruce was able to develop theratio of power to speed and the momentum he needed, without sacrificing one atthe expense of the other.Bruce’s workout schedule often listed the number of repetitions of exerciseshe’d set himself, and beside some was the note ‘INF’, meaning ‘to infinity’. Hewould keep going until he could go no further, and then do some more.Even out of the gym, Bruce never stopped training in one way or another. Back inthe 1950s, every schoolboy had cut out a newspaper coupon to send away fordetails of a body-building method known as Dynamic Tension. Charles Atlas hadbuilt a mail-order empire by promising to help 100-pound weaklings get revengeagainst bullies who kicked sand in their faces. Dynamic Tension was in fact anexercise system known as isometrics, in which one group of muscles works againstan opposing group. For example, by gripping the hands in front of the chest andtrying to pull them apart without letting go, or by working against a deadweight. Bruce put this idea into practice whenever he could – for example,standing next to a wall in a casual conversation with someone, he would pushagainst it with the back of his hand to ‘flow the energy’ in his triceps.Bruce utilized whatever was to hand: he practised kicking by kicking trees untilthey were jarred by the force; he practised accuracy by kicking at pieces oflitter that had been blown up by the breeze, and where no particular trainingequipment existed to meet his needs, he invented it, then called on James Lee’swelding skills to construct it.Go into any modern, well-equipped martial arts school and you will find avariety of practice apparatus. There will be a heavy bag for punching andkicking at full power, a top-and-bottom speed bag which springs back only ifpunched in a straight line, a selection of smaller bags (with various fillings)and padded mitts to practise punching with accuracy and power. You might alsofind air-filled kicking shields to practise depth of penetration and kicking onthe move, and there will almost certainly be a loop and pulley device to stretchthe legs. All of this equipment was first assembled in James Lee’s garage.Yet, even with the most comprehensive array of training equipment, Bruce stillfound ways of getting even more out of the apparatus, increasing both his ownand James Lee’s skills. The wing chun wooden dummy was also adapted, giving it aspring-loaded head, while bags were mounted on spring-loaded platforms so as tofly back unpredictably, or built oversize so that extra power was needed to makean impact.Bruce also tried to get a little more out of the equipment by investing extraenergy in his approach to it. The heavy bag wasn’t punched passively: Brucevisualized it as an opponent who he needed to fight, ducking and sidestepping,moving in and out, while being aware of timing and relaxation. He felt that realsparring was most valuable against an untrained, uncoordinated fighter, becauseof his sheer unpredictability. By this combination of methods, the improvedstamina, strength, flexibility and economy were gained by running, weighttraining, stretching and sparring. Bruce did everything he could to maintainthese gains and also began experimenting with high-protein, weight-gain drinks,which he blended and supplemented with ginseng, royal jelly and massive doses ofvitamins.For Bruce Lee the spirit in which everything was carried out was as important astechnique and this required harnessing mental and emotional force. The secret ofthis emotional content was a kind of purposefully directed anger. Once whileBruce was showing Taky a move, he wasn’t satisfied with the way Taky did it andcasually slapped him hard across the face. Taky’s eyes narrowed and, forgettingit was Bruce, he moved in aggressively.‘Yes!’ said Bruce, laughing. ‘That’s what I want!’ Bruce tried anything intraining that would add the anger and fear that are stirred up in realconfrontation so that he could practise remaining centred under stress.Before long Bruce had become so powerful and effective that he could only goall-out on the wooden dummy; it became too dangerous to do so on a person.Anyone holding an air shield for Bruce to kick would usually end up on his back;one unsuspecting visitor who held a punching mitt for him had his shoulderdislocated with the force of the blow. The power that he could channel wasn’tmerely the result of conditioning and training, it arose from regular periods ofmeditation, the wellspring of chi. Bruce was less inclined to talk aboutmeditating than fighting but the first item of his daily to-do list was always‘Meditation and Mental Training’.One evening, after a long day’s training and teaching, Bruce and Linda went outfor dinner to a restaurant in San Francisco. After being shown to their tableBruce thought he recognized one of the waiters on the other side of the room.Sensing Bruce’s gaze on him, the man looked up and his eyes widened as the teahe was pouring for a customer spilled over the top of the cup and ran onto thetable. The waiter was Wong Jak Man."},{"pageContent":" 11SCREEN TESTBack when Bruce Lee did his kung fu demonstration at Ed Parker’s karatetournament at Long Beach in July 1964, Jay Sebring was in the audience. Jay wasthe owner of a Beverly Hills hair salon and he’d trained with Parker. What hesaw that afternoon impressed him as much as it did everyone else.One of Sebring’s clients was William Dozier, a TV producer whose creditsincluded the Gunsmoke and Perry Mason series. Once, when Dozier was getting ahaircut, he mentioned to Sebring that he was looking for someone to play thepart of Charlie Chan’s son in a new series about the Chinese detective. Sebringsuggested he get in touch with Bruce Lee.On 1 February 1965, at East Oakland Hospital, Linda gave birth to a son: BrandonBruce Lee. Three days and as many sleepless nights later, Bruce found himself infront of the cameras at the studios of Twentieth Century Fox to take part in ascreen test for a possible role in the Charlie Chan TV series.On a chair in the centre of what looks like a smart suburban living room sits ayoung man wearing a neat black suit which looks a size too small, a white shirtand a black tie with a small tight knot; his hair is short and neatly brushed.He sits with his legs crossed and his hands clasped together as he smilesnervously – a quiet and unassuming man whose face might even be said to lookslightly chubby. Suddenly he glances somewhere over to his left, where from thedarkness a voice instructs:‘Now, Bruce, look into the camera lens and tell us your name, age and where youwere born.’‘My name is Lee, Bruce Lee. I was born in San Francisco. I am twenty-four rightnow.’‘And you worked in motion pictures in Hong Kong?’‘Yes, since I was around six years old.’‘And when did you leave Hong Kong?’‘1959, when I was eighteen.’‘I see. Now look over to me, Bruce, as we talk,’ continues the director. ‘Iunderstand you’ve just had a baby boy and you’ve lost a little sleep.’‘Yeah.’ Bruce laughs. ‘Three nights.’ His voice flutters nervously and hisfacial expressions are a little exaggerated.‘You told me earlier today that karate and ju-jitsu are not the most powerfulforms of oriental fighting. Which are the best?’ asks the director.‘Well, I think kung fu is pretty good,’ is the untypically modest reply. Afterfurther prompting, Bruce continues: ‘Kung fu is a more complete system, and it’smore fluid.’Recalling the time that Yip Man sent him away from school to think things over,the day he had spent walking by the water, Bruce compares the principle of kungfu to the nature of water. ‘You cannot punch it and hurt it; you cannot grasphold of it. Every kung fu man is trying to do that, to be flexible, to adapt tothe opponent.’‘What’s the difference between a karate punch and a kung fu punch?’ comes afurther question.‘Well,’ replied Bruce, ‘a karate punch is like being hit by an iron bar –whack!’ He pauses for a moment and smiles. ‘A kung fu punch is like being hit byan iron ball swung on an iron chain – WHANG! – and it hurts inside.’After a fresh reel of film is loaded Bruce acts out some of the characters fromclassical Chinese theatre, demonstrating the moves and gestures that representthe scholar and the warrior.‘Now show us some kung fu movements,’ says the director.‘Well, it’s hard to show it alone, but I’ll do my best.’To the delight of his sniggering colleagues a middle-aged man with silver hairand spectacles – a member of the studio staff – is ‘volunteered’ as Bruce’sstooge.Bruce catches the atmosphere and warms to the situation by joking, ‘Accidents dohappen!’‘There are various kinds of fights,’ he begins. ‘It depends on where you hit andwhat weapon you use. To the eyes, you will use the fingers.’Bruce throws a lightning bil jee strike towards the man’s eyes. The old manlooks more than worried.‘Don’t worry,’ Bruce assures him and whips out another jab to his eyes. ‘And tothe face,’ he says, as his punches make an audible rush of air, lashing withinan inch of the man’s nose as he explains that the power of the punches comesfrom the waist.The director steps out in front of the camera for a moment to adjust Bruce’s andthe old man’s positions in relation to the camera.By now the subdued chuckles from the floor have become belly laughs and Brucejoins in the conspiracy with the studio technicians, trying to hide his laughterwith his hand across his face. The director, sensing the hapless volunteer’srising desperation, asks Bruce to back off a little.‘You know, kung fu is very sneaky,’ says Bruce, ‘just like the Chinese.’The old man is as jumpy as a rabbit. ‘These are just natural reactions,’ hepleads.Bruce pats him on the shoulder to reassure him.‘Right!’ smiles Bruce, who has spent years training to replace such humanreactions with far more useful ones.‘Then there is the jab, the punch, the back fist . . . and then low!’ heexclaims as he whips out three strikes that slice the air around the man’s head,then drops low to strike at the groin the instant the man’s hands have moved upto protect his face.‘Then there are the kicks, straight to the groin, then up!’And, just as fast as the punches, there is a front kick to the groin, aroundhouse kick and a hook kick to the head.‘He looks kind of worried,’ adds Bruce casually, now in complete command of thesituation.Everyone realizes the speed and accuracy of the movements they are witnessing.The technicians laugh openly, both at their colleague’s predicament and inamazed disbelief at something none of them has ever seen before.‘He’s got nothing to worry about,’ says the director confidently. ‘Now show ushow a good kung fu man would coolly handle it and walk away.’But before Bruce can demonstrate this slightly unfamiliar approach for him, thereel of film runs out.Bruce might well have gone on to explain that martial arts’ animal formsoriginated with Shaolin warrior priests’ observation of various animals. Theemphasis was not so much on the actual physical movements of the animal as onits vital energy. In the Shaolin tradition, imitating each animal developed aparticular attribute. For example, the tiger strengthened bone; the dragonbrought strength of spirit. Bruce Lee’s first experience of the animal fightingstyles was watching Master Kwan’s films as a boy.By now, a new reel of film has been loaded.‘Practising alone involves forms,’ says Bruce as filming recommences, ‘imitatingfor instance a crane, a monkey or a praying mantis.’Despite the tight suit he’s wearing, Bruce completes his screen test bydemonstrating the crane form, stretching his arms and weaving them into fluidmovements which suggest the neck, head and beak of a great bird and its flappingwings. Suddenly he stabs out a strike and then kicks high above his head,‘Biaah!’ an animal shriek is followed by another fierce jab, before he windsdown the routine and looks over, almost bowing for a second, to the director.‘Show us one more and then we’re all finished,’ says the director.As Bruce tries to pull his shirt sleeves and suit jacket back into shape, hecontinues, taking a forward stance with his hands extended and fingers curledinto claws as he runs through the tiger form.‘Thank you very much.’A week later, on 8 February, Bruce’s father died in Hong Kong. With the new babyjust arrived, Bruce decided to go alone to the funeral. In Hong Kong, he arrivedat the mortuary where his father’s remains lay and crawled from the front doorto the coffin, wailing loudly for good measure. Chinese tradition requirespenance from a son who was not present at the death of his father. HopefullyBruce’s noisy atonement brought some peace to Lee Hoi Cheun’s soul.While he was away Linda visited her mother, who still hadn’t entirely acceptedher daughter’s marriage. When Linda arrived in Seattle with baby Brandon in herarms her mother greeted her with, ‘How could you have done this?’Two weeks later, when Bruce and Linda were back together in Oakland, WilliamDozier called to say that the Charlie Chan series had been shelved. He addedthat a good audience reaction to his new Batman series would allow him to followit with an entirely new series, The Green Hornet, using the same formula of anadventure-strip hero and his partner. Bruce was signed to a one-year option toplay the role of the Green Hornet’s kung fu sidekick, Kato. In May 1965, with nofilming yet scheduled, the Lees boarded a plane back to Hong Kong. In one ofthose little ironies that life sometimes arranges, their combined air fare cameto $1,800 – the exact amount Bruce had been advanced by Dozier.Life at Nathan Road was not smooth. Grace Lee was still grieving the death ofher husband while Linda struggled with a baby who cried most of the night in thesweltering heat. Although Linda didn’t encounter the same prejudice Bruce hadendured from her family, she was unable to speak more than a few words ofCantonese and felt left out. Bruce tried to smooth things out by joking that thenew member of the family was the only blond-haired Chinaman in the world, thenadded to Linda’s problems by promising everyone that she would cook them awonderful meal.In the US, Batman was well received and The Green Hornet was set to follow itinto production, but William Dozier still had no idea when. From Hong Kong Brucemade regular calls to the States about the series, but made no attempt tocontact any of his friends and colleagues in the Hong Kong movie industry, eventhough most of them were still active in the business. It was obvious that itwas in America that Bruce intended to make something of himself.During the four months that Bruce and Linda spent in Hong Kong, he settled thedetails of his father’s estate. He and Linda went on occasional outings,shopping trips or sightseeing. And Bruce took Brandon to visit Yip Man, to ask afavour of him. Hawkins Cheung was also back in Hong Kong at the time and the twoof them happened upon each other in the street.Hawkins recalls:I was just about to say hello when Bruce stepped in quickly – I was surprisedthat his movement was so fast. His character hadn’t changed at all; he stillwanted to be top dog. Bruce told me, ‘I have to train very hard to beat myopponents, so I’ve come back to learn more of the dummy techniques from the oldman. I want to film him so I can show my students in America. I’m on my way tosee him now.’A few days later, Bruce gave a demonstration on a popular TV chat show. Hedidn’t say anything about wing chun or Yip Man and I suspected that somethinghad happened between them. I knew Bruce’s character: if he wanted something, noone would stop him. If they did, then Bruce would go out on his own and comeback and show you. I found out that the old man had refused to be filmed doingthe wooden dummy form. His traditional thinking had come up against Bruce’sWestern thinking.For the rest of his stay Bruce continued his intense training regime at a localgym. He alternated this activity with long periods of deep thought as heconsidered a complete break with tradition to forge his own martial arts way. Atthe same time, he was starting to feel concern about how he was going to earnenough to provide for his family. Maybe a return to acting would be the answer.In September 1965, Bruce, Linda and baby Brandon returned to Seattle where theywent to stay with Linda’s family. Brandon was still not sleeping through thenight, and his howling throughout most of the day was punctuated by remarks fromLinda’s mother, who was given to wondering out loud when Bruce was going to gethimself a proper job. During these months of relative inactivity while waitingfor the call to start work on The Green Hornet, Bruce began to suffer fromsevere backache. He tried to ignore it, because the need to push forward withhis ambitions was even more intense.Later that year, the Lee family hardly had time to settle back into James Lee’shouse in Oakland when the call came through from William Dozier that The GreenHornet was due to start shooting in three months’ time. In March 1966, Bruce,Linda and baby Brandon moved to Los Angeles, to a small apartment at Wilshireand Gayley in Westwood, an upscale area in the west of the city. It was Bruceand Linda’s first home of their own since they’d been married. Realizing he wasgoing to be paid $400 for each episode of The Green Hornet, Bruce did what anyman would: he went out and bought a new car, a modest blue Chevy Nova."},{"pageContent":" 12THE GREEN HORNET. . . Another challenge for the Green Hornet, his aid Kato and their rollingarsenal, the Black Beauty. On police records a wanted criminal, the Green Hornetis really Britt Reid, owner-publisher of the Daily Sentinel, his dual identityknown only to his secretary and the district attorney. And now, to protect therights and lives of decent citizens, rides the Green Hornet!The Green Hornet had been one of America’s most popular radio serials of the1930s. Created by writer George W. Trendle, the character of Britt Reid was thenephew of another one of Trendle’s fictional characters, Dan Reid, better knownas the Lone Ranger. At night, Britt Reid, played by Van Williams, changed hisbusiness suit for green clothes and a mask to become the scourge of criminals,while Bruce Lee was cast as the hero’s chauffeur and sidekick, Kato. He wore achauffeur’s uniform and a mask and drove their own version of the Batmobile: theBlack Beauty.Thirty half-hour episodes were planned, and naturally Bruce was most concernedabout how the action was to be staged. At first the fights were planned to belike the slugging matches seen in Westerns, but Bruce refused to take thisapproach, saying the essence of his kung fu was efficiency. To illustrate this,he suggested the fights be shown in slow motion, an idea used many times since.When it came to filming the fight scenes, Bruce was forced to slow down hismovements because they only registered as a blur when filmed at normal speed. Atthe director’s insistence, Bruce agreed to some flashy flying kicks for visualimpact, but not before he’d pointed out that, in a real fight, moves like thatwould get you into serious trouble.Gene LeBell was a regular in stunt work and fight set-ups in literally hundredsof movies and became one of the few people Bruce Lee would openly accept lessonsfrom. By the time Bruce and LeBell met on the set of The Green Hornet, LeBellhad already won every major judo championship and a wrestling crown. In 1962,LeBell held the World Professional Wrestling Championship, even if it was onlyfor twelve seconds. He would’ve held it longer had it not been for a ring fracasin which he ‘accidentally’ kicked the Texas wrestling commissioner in the head.Gene LeBell was as pre-eminent in the grappling world as Bruce Lee was to becomein the world of Chinese martial arts. But while winning a dozen titles andhaving people say he was the toughest guy in the world was great, it stilldidn’t add up to one car payment. LeBell realized that his money was going tohave to be made some other way, even if it meant getting beaten up by every wimpin Hollywood.Gene first met Bruce on the set of The Green Hornet after Benny Dobbins, thestunt coordinator for the show, called LeBell and told him me he was needed totake some falls from a guy called Bruce Lee, who was unbelievably athletic andwas stealing all the scenes. He added that he kicked like a jumping bean. At thetime, no one, including LeBell, had ever seen anything like Bruce’s fightingstyle.When LeBell got to the set, Benny pointed out Bruce and told him to go and putBruce in a headlock or something. The wrestler grabbed Bruce and put him in afireman’s lift over his shoulder, then ran the length of the set and back again.‘Put me down!’ shouted Bruce. ‘Put me down or I’ll kill you!’ But LeBell justcarried on running, with Bruce still shouting, ‘Put me down!’LeBell replied, ‘I can’t put you down, or you’ll kill me!’ In the end they bothhad a good laugh about it.‘We ended up becoming great friends,’ LeBell says. ‘We would work out togetherand exchange techniques. Bruce loved to learn grappling, but said that peoplewould never go for it in movies or TV because most of the good stuff was hidden.He said they wanted to see fancy kicking, acrobatics and weapons. One time hekicked me really hard and I remember thinking it was a good thing he only wore asize six shoe instead of a fourteen like me, otherwise that kick would’ve sentme all the way to China.’The Green Hornet premiered on 9 September 1966. A dramatic voice intoned theintroduction over a jazzy version of ‘The Flight of the Bumble Bee’ blended inwith a buzz created on a Theremin. The narrator was the same as the one whoopened the Batman shows, the producer himself, William Dozier.The first episode introduced the American television audience to kung fu. In theopening scene of act two, the Hornet and Kato are surprised by three hoods. Katokicks a wooden box into their midst, distracting them for the instant he needsto act. The fight is short and sweet, a few fast kicks and powerful punches. Inthe following fight scene Kato overcomes gun-toting criminals by flinging poisondarts at them, while the Hornet carries a gun that shoots a powerful butnon-lethal sleep-inducing gas. The Hornet’s ‘sting’ was a collapsible devicewhich fired an ultrasonic beam powerful enough to shatter metal. Kato mainlyused his fists and feet, though in one episode he introduced a Chinese weapon,the nunchakas, two short sticks linked by a chain.The duo’s car, the Black Beauty, was a matt-black 1966 Chrysler Imperial,adapted by Hollywood automobile customizer Dean Jeffries at a cost of $50,000.The car was armed with rockets and other deadly devices, with green headlightsthat allowed the heroes to see four miles ahead at night with the aid of abuilt-in camera. It was stored underground in Britt Reid’s garage, suspendedupside-down on a rotating platform ready to replace his convertible when he setout as the Green Hornet. Access to the Hornet’s stronghold was through a hole ina Candy Mints poster (an early bit of product placement).In a review of the first episode, one critic commented, ‘Those who watch himwould bet on Lee to render Cassius Clay [later to change his name to MuhammadAli] senseless, if they were put into a room and told that anything goes.’ Wecan speculate for ever about what might’ve happened in such a situation. But notlong after this review Bruce Lee was at a dinner where one of the other guestswas Senator John Tunney, the son of the former heavyweight champion Gene Tunney.Bruce amazed the senator by being able to describe all his father’s fights indetail and added that he had books and films about him in his library. SenatorTunney then asked Bruce if he thought he could have beaten his father. Brucereplied, ‘If I stood still and your father hit me, then forget it! The questionis: Could he have got close to me?’ Bruce said that while the boxer had only twohands, he had his hands and feet, elbow, knees and fingers.The series marked the first time that kung fu had been seen in the West outsidethe movie theatres of the Chinatown districts, and younger viewers wereastonished by what they saw. The real star of The Green Hornet was Kato, andBruce was soon making personal appearances in character across the country,sometimes making several stops in one day as he did the usual round of localradio guest spots and TV shows, opened supermarkets and appeared at fairs, inpublic parks or at martial arts tournaments.Although Bruce was a natural showman and even an outright show-off, he putlimits on how far he was prepared to exploit his skills, even at the thenhandsome fee of $1,000 or more per appearance. He exclaimed again and again thathe had no time for tricks like breaking boards, adding, ‘Boards don’t hit back’.Although he was mobbed by enthusiastic fans on these public appearances, he washardly getting his face known by appearing as Kato and wearing a mask.Surprisingly, nearly half of Bruce’s fan mail was from young girls. In reply toone of these letters, from a girl called Vicki, he explained that as Kato hepracticed gung fu and not karate as she had presumably assumed. He also advisedher rather sternly to work on her technique. Mastering that should be her goalrather than aiming to break boards or bricks – a practice he dismissed as astunt. ‘If you want to break something, use a hammer,’ he wrote.Younger audiences loved the show, but because it was played straight, adultsweren’t as enthusiastic, preferring the more camp Batman. As ‘real’ characters,Kato and the Green Hornet were simply unbelievable, which was particularlyironic given that this was probably the first time any authentic fighting skillshad been seen on TV outside the boxing ring. In the end The Green Hornet closedon 14 July 1967 after twenty-six weekly episodes finishing with an additionaltwo-part show in which the Green Hornet and Kato teamed up with Batman and Robinin a crossover episode to launch the second Batman series.In this episode the Green Hornet and Kato battle Batman and Robin, who somehowmanages to match the skills of the world’s pre-eminent martial artist. Thedirector, not wanting to upset fans of either series, had Batman and Robin fightthe Hornet and Kato to a draw, and eventually all four combine their resourcesto defeat the villainous stamp thief, Colonel Gumm. As he read the script forthis final episode a wicked grin spread across Bruce Lee’s face.On the day of the filming, Bruce maintained an icy silence but his eyes burnedthrough the holes in the mask he wore. Once or twice actor Burt Ward, who playedRobin, cracked a feeble joke. When the cameras began rolling for the fightscene, Bruce began to stalk his opponent menacingly. Ward backed awayspluttering that it was only a TV show, but Bruce ignored him and closed in.Off-stage someone squawked like a chicken and Bruce exploded into laughter,unable to keep up the act any longer. ‘Lucky it is a TV show,’ he added with awry smile.The Hornet and Kato made two further TV appearances. Bruce Lee and Van Williamsmade a personal appearance as themselves on a rock ’n’ roll variety show, Wherethe Action Is, on 1 September 1966. This show toured throughout the US andfeatured popular music acts of the day, such as the Mamas and Papas and theKnickerbockers, playing games and interviewing celebrities. On The Milton BerleShow during the autumn of the 1966–67 season, the Hornet and Kato appeared incharacter in a comedy skit in which Berle was cast as a stuntman supposedlyworking on an episode of their show.Ironically, it was Bert Kwouk’s parody of the Kato character that went on togreater mainstream success in the series of Pink Panther comedies starring PeterSellers as the hapless Inspector Clouseau. Kato was Clouseau’s valet and hadstanding instructions to keep his master’s martial art skills honed by launchingattacks on him without warning, resulting in the response, ‘Not now Kato, youlittle yellow fool!’ As you can see, there was still some way to go before theChinese stereotype was laid to rest.With the cancellation of The Green Hornet series, the Lees were soon on the moveonce more. Although the large twenty-third-floor apartment in nearby BarringtonPlaza was one they could afford even less, Bruce arranged to give martial artslessons to the landlord in return for a rent reduction. The landlord, as itturned out, had similar arrangements with many of the tenants and soon both heand the Lee family were uprooted.Despite the fact that Bruce had generated almost all of the fan mail for TheGreen Hornet, further roles did not materialize and Bruce felt as though he’dtaken a big step back. While continuing to make occasional appearances as Kato,he again directed his energy into what he knew best, teaching kung fu. As ateacher, Bruce’s role was to expose his students’ vulnerability, but privatelyhe was being forced to deal with his own. Introspection and inactivity had beenfollowed by success and then disappointment. As he would have to do severaltimes throughout his life, Bruce was forced to strike an increasingly fragilebalance between his ambitions and his art."},{"pageContent":" 13JEET KUNE DOWhen they were working together at the Statler Hilton, Bruce Lee and DanInosanto had talked about swordsmanship. Bruce said that the most efficient wayof countering in fencing is the ‘stop-hit’, where you parry and counter in onemove so that when the opponent attacks, you intercept the move with a thrust ofyour own. The idea is to score a hit in the middle of your attacker’s action,making it the most economical of all counters.Bruce then said, ‘We should call our method the stop-hitting fist style, or theintercepting fist style.’‘What would that be in Chinese?’ asked Inosanto.‘That would be jeet kune do,’ said Bruce.Bruce Lee came to regret coining the phrase ‘jeet kune do’. When he proposed it,he had no intention of creating a new martial arts style. ‘It’s just a name,don’t fuss over it,’ he would often say later. ‘There’s no such thing as a styleif you understand the roots of combat.’He would describe how a student learning a martial art passes through threestages. In the first stage, he or she understands very little about the art ofcombat. In a fight, all of their blocks or strikes would be uncontrolled andinaccurate. Like the person who is attacked by surprise in a dark street, theuntrained angry or fearful reaction is to withdraw defensively or lash outwildly, to freeze or flail, rather than to fight efficiently.In the second phase, the student finds that he or she must move and breathe in acompletely new way, which means thoughts and feelings will also change. Infighting or sparring, there will be moments of ‘psychic stoppage’, where hefreezes for a moment to analyse what’s happening and calculate a response. Forthe time being, the student loses the ability to fight without thinking. Thisphase involves a long period of training in which the student learns varioustechniques of striking, kicking and blocking. Here a long period of repetitionto open up the neurological circuits and commit the moves to ‘muscle memory’ isessential – remember, ‘kung fu’ means ‘time spent’ or ‘effort put in’. As BruceLee put it, ‘I have no fear of a man who practises ten thousand kicks once, butI do fear a man who has practised one kick ten thousand times.’The final stage, when the right moves happen automatically, involves thecombination of factors that Bruce Lee was aiming to instil in his students: thephysical, emotional and mental coordination that allows the spontaneous andspirited flow of appropriate action in combat. Bruce once showed Dan Inosantowhat he meant by flinging an object at him without warning. As Dan caught it,Bruce pointed out that Dan had simply acted directly and naturally, withoutadopting any special stance or needing to wear a special uniform.At this level, technique and strategy mean simply fitting into the opponent’smovements and intentions, neither opposing an attacking force head-on with toomuch resistance or over aggression, nor giving way completely. Pliable as aspring, the fighter becomes the complement of the opponent’s energy. Sensing andunderstanding the interplay of energy involved, the fighter no longer feelshimself as separate from either his opponent or the fight. He no longer opposesor struggles but simply completes his own half of a single whole. The fighterand the fight take on an ego-less impartial quality in which the conflictresolves itself naturally. This is a level of ability that can never be reachedby learning more and more techniques, but only by moving to an entirely newlevel of sensory perception. At this level of ability, the martial artist isbeyond mastering techniques: everything just flows, simply and directly,according to the training that has been embodied. As Bruce put it: ‘It hits.’Dan Inosanto likened the process of learning a martial art to learning to read.‘Eventually you learn to read groups of words. Where a student will see threemotions, the experienced man will see one, because he sees the overall energypath.’In a letter to Dan Inosanto, Bruce wrote, ‘Use your common sense to see what isthe real thing and what are merely lessons in routine dancing. Gung fu is simplythe direct expression of one’s feelings with the minimum lines and energy.’To summarize: the objective of martial art training is to replace wrong orinappropriate reflexes with more useful ones. At first the student will fightany old way. Then he or she practises for a long time, repeatedly andconscientiously, to discover a new way. Eventually this new way becomesinstinctive. Bruce Lee firmly rejected the idea that this learning process isone of accumulation. Mastery is approached, he said, not through acquiring moreand more knowledge, but through stripping away the non-essentials. A stonesculptor, rather than building in clay, chisels away everything he doesn’t needto reveal the underlying form hidden inside the material. Continuing thisanalogy, Bruce often referred to his kicks and punches as tools.Bruce Lee found it both difficult and frustrating to try and teach people rightfrom the beginning. Jeet kune do was a conceptual approach, and as such it wasof no use to people at the first stage of a martial art, only to thoseexperienced martial artists who had reached the third stage and who were willingto search further."},{"pageContent":" 14STUDENT-MASTERAfter improvising for several months in various temporary Chinatown locations,such as Wayne Chan’s pharmacy, Bruce Lee opened his third school in February1967 at 628 College Street, just a few blocks from the Los Angeles DodgerStadium. The institute, like those in Seattle and Oakland, was in an anonymousbuilding. On Bruce’s orders no visitors from outside were allowed into theschool, and to ensure complete privacy the windows were painted over with redenamel paint. Dan Inosanto was appointed Bruce’s assistant, and membership wasstrictly limited to martial artists who showed talent. If Bruce found a martialartist who already had some grounding or someone who could use what he had tooffer, he was often prepared to teach them for free.An early student Jerry Poteet recalls, ‘I was short of money and unable to payfor training, but Bruce wrote me a letter saying, “Come on in. Forget aboutpaying until you can. You’re sincere and that’s what counts.” ’Bruce encouraged his students to train in their street clothes, saying that thiswas what they would most likely be wearing if they were involved in a fight. Butwhile he liked to keep things relaxed and friendly, he could be strict when thesituation demanded it. He once addressed the whole class: ‘I know that a lot ofus are friends and that outside of the school I’m Bruce, but in here you call meSifu. Because of the informality, there has to be some discipline. If thisschool was in China, there would be a lot of people here now missing their frontteeth.’Classical martial arts training traditionally combines the development ofstrength with testing a student’s patience and sincerity by having him spendconsiderable time standing in the deep, wide horse stances. Bruce saw thispractice as divorced from the reality of fighting and as pointless as ‘learningto swim on dry land’, but even so, during the first few months of training hisstudents endured a similar probation period. Each week included severalgruelling sessions of physical conditioning when quite a few people fell by thewayside. Serious teaching began only for those who remained. Dan Lee – now a taichi instructor in Pasadena, California – was an electrical engineer and languageinstructor when he became the Los Angeles school’s first pupil in 1967.‘Part of the high standards Bruce maintained involved giving everyone a personalfitness programme,’ Dan explains. ‘He looked at you and saw what area you neededto work on most. He really meant business and worked very hard. He was the oneperson I respected most. He was a straightforward person, intense, but most ofall honest. He didn’t hold back any punches.’Dan Lee’s last remark has a double edge to it. While Bruce insisted ondiscipline in his classes, he sometimes struggled to control his own volatilenature. One night after class, Dan Inosanto, Dan Lee and Bruce Lee were inBruce’s kitchen at home. Bruce got out some boxing gloves and challenged Dan Leeto a knockabout. While they were jabbing at each other, Dan got through with ‘alucky punch’, which caused Bruce to go after him for real.Dan Inosanto recalls, ‘Bruce broke his jaw as he followed him, hitting him withshort punches all the way down to the ground. He must have hit him fifteen ortwenty times, or at least it looked that way. It was all incredibly fast, but hedid control the blows.’‘Yes, it happened,’ confirms Dan Lee. ‘It was a long time ago. I was veryprivileged to work with Bruce Lee.’‘If Bruce had one drawback,’ adds Dan Inosanto, ‘it was his temper. He once toldme that it was because he was in a rush to educate people and wanted fastresults.’Bruce didn’t have years to spend building the foundation he’d received in HongKong. He simply couldn’t spend the time needed on one-to-one sticking handspractice to induce the required reflexes and awareness. So instead he’d work atthe highest level from the moment students walked through the door. Anyone withno previous experience of these methods would have been left overwhelmed andbewildered.Bruce also had a generous spirit, Dan Inosanto recalls: ‘I was in a sportinggoods store with Bruce when I saw a set of weights I wanted to buy, but then Irealized I only had twelve dollars on me. Bruce said that, while we were there,he should probably buy a set of weights for Brandon. I thought, He’s startingBrandon a bit early; he’s far too young for weight training. Later that day,when we arrived at my house, Bruce turned to me and said, “I really bought theseweights for you, so you’d better start using them.” I almost cried because ofhis generosity.’Shortly after the Los Angeles school opened there was a confrontation, as hadhappened in Oakland, this time with two local martial artists who turned up atthe institute wanting to fight. Bruce explained that they were in the middle ofa class and, if they wanted to fight him, they would have to wait until theclass was over. He quickly rearranged the class so that Dan Lee, one of his beststudents, was working out in front of the two challengers. During a break in theclass, Bruce sauntered over to the spectators and said that if they still wantedto fight he’d be more than happy to let them spar with his students. The pairpolitely turned down the invitation and left. Bruce had used what was, for him,a new kind of strategy: ‘The art of winning, without fighting,’ says Dan Lee.Because Bruce could teach only small classes, he decided to boost his income bytaking on private students who paid a $50-per-hour rate instead of paying theregular monthly fee. The celebrity hairdresser Jay Sebring, whose clientsincluded James Coburn, Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate, put Bruce in contact withSteve McQueen and the movie star became one of Bruce’s first celebrity pupils.Sebring acted as something of a go-between for Bruce and others, puttingentertainment industry movers and shakers in touch with each other. In addition,Bruce’s growing reputation meant he attracted many professional fighters,including several karate champions, for personal training.Karate was first introduced to America by former Second World War servicemen whohad learned the art while stationed in Okinawa. The first karate school in theUnited States was opened by Robert Trias in 1946, and a decade later karate waspopularized by Ed Parker, the man who organized the 1964 Long Beach Tournamentwhere Bruce was discovered. At that time Western teachers were still at greatpains to adhere to the Asian tradition they were passing on, but in abandoningtradition, Bruce Lee both anticipated and set the stage for a new breed ofmartial artist. Traditionally, the mixing of martial arts was frowned upon, butthings changed when Chuck Norris mixed Korean and Japanese arts to his ownadvantage, out-kicking the Japanese stylists and out-punching the Korean.Joe Lewis first met Bruce Lee briefly at Washington’s Mayflower Hotel, whereboth were guests at the 1967 National Karate Championships. Lewis was thedefending champion, while Bruce was appearing as Kato! But it wasn’t until theywere back in California that they had a chance to speak, when they met again ina parking lot outside the offices of a martial arts magazine.Joe Lewis recalls:As I left the building to get into my car, Bruce Lee called me over and gave methis pitch about becoming my instructor and showed me various moves. Here wasthis little kung fu guy trying to tell me something about fighting, and I’msaying to myself, ‘I’m an international karate champion and this guy’s going totell me about fighting?’ What he was saying just went in one ear and out theother. He spent a long time trying to convince me about some of the things hewas doing, but I just had a blank screen up.Anyway, I was in partnership with Bob Wall and Mike Stone [also karatechampions] and one day, some time after this meeting, Mike started telling usabout this guy Bruce Lee who was phenomenal with all the different techniques hewas doing. For him to compliment somebody unknown like Bruce Lee was strange,because I couldn’t remember hearing Mike Stone ever compliment anyone. MikeStone sold me on Bruce’s theories which came from utilizing fencing footwork andwing chun to make it applicable to kickboxing, which is what I was into.Bruce set it up so that Mike Stone, Chuck Norris and I would visit his houseonce or twice a week. He showed me a lot of fighting principles and emphasizedfootwork and the importance of using distance and mobility against an opponent.Bruce had hundreds of books on all the fighting arts as well as hundreds ofboxing manuals and dozens of films. We used to sit and analyze boxing andwrestling films. We studied the way Ali punched, and the way he could controlpeople even while backing up. Bruce said that he wanted to train Ali how tokick. He said that if he could do that then Ali would be like someone fromanother planet.The 1951 championship fight between Willie Pep and Sandy Saddler was aparticular favourite of Bruce’s. In this fight Pep uses interesting footworkborrowed from judo. During the course of the fight, which Pep was losing, hewasn’t averse to using an open hand so he could jab Saddler’s eyes with histhumb. Once or twice, on the blind side of the referee, he used a judo leg tripto unbalance his opponent, along with many other non-boxing techniques.Joe Lewis continues:We would study the strategies on film and go to tournaments and watch guysfight. Then I would go out in a tournament and prove whether it worked or not.You can’t have a better set-up than that. I thought it was the greatest lifethat ever existed, and I don’t think there was ever anything like it before, orever will be again.In person, Bruce had a charm that didn’t come across on the screen. I guess youcould use the word ‘magic’. What does the word magic mean? There’s a spark ofenthusiasm in everybody’s mind. Bruce used to ignite that spark. He couldexplode that sense of imagination in you. You’d say, ‘Wow! That’s what martialarts is all about! Yeah, Bruce, you’re right on the money!’ It had that kind offlavour. He could just inspire you to love martial arts. The word ought to be‘inspiration’. He was an incredibly encouraging, inspiring spark of energy.It should be noted that Bruce Lee’s karate star students were already formidablefighters before they met him. In Okinawa, where Joe Lewis was stationed with theMarine Corps prior to serving in Vietnam, he became a black belt in anunprecedented seven months, then won his first national tournament in 1966.Bruce Lee would claim that even great champions recognized his genius, andperhaps he was right, but Bruce was also shrewd enough to realize that he had asmuch to gain from them too.Joe Lewis says:Bruce wanted people who would go out and represent what he stood for. He figuredhe’d get the biggest names at that time and build up his credibility as aninstructor. The masters on the Chinese kung fu circuit looked down at him, andBruce resented it, because he felt that most, if not all, of these kung fumasters couldn’t fight. I think he wanted the prestige of being able to say thathe was a master and that his students were champions. He didn’t get any respectfrom the kung fu masters at that time and felt very misunderstood by peoplearound him.He needed attention and a sense of people looking at him and feeling he wassignificant. He didn’t just want to be looked on as a kung fu expert. That wasthe label he had and it was hard to shake off. He’d come to me and say, ‘Joe,I’m not a master. I’m a student-master, meaning that I have the knowledge of amaster and the expertise of a master, but I’m still learning, so I’m astudent-master.’ That was the term he used to my face.Dan Inosanto commented that Bruce never really believed in the word master.Bruce had told him that the master was only a word that could be used when theyclosed the casket. Inosanto says that Bruce avoided a term he thought could onlybe used posthumously.An account of Joe Lewis’s win at the 1968 International Karate Tournament, whichfollowed a period of intensive training with Bruce, described Lewis as ‘afighter reborn’. His often surly disposition was put to one side and hedisplayed a new-found mobility that had never been seen before. When he wasawarded the crown, Lewis humbly thanked his teacher, something he’d never donebefore. Within a year of beginning training with Bruce, Joe Lewis becameunbeatable in tournament competition; he was even dubbed the ‘Muhammad Ali ofkarate’ as he went on to win an unprecedented ten titles.Bruce Lee had now been training in kung fu for over half his life and hadreached such a level of ‘student-mastery’ that there were only a handful ofpeople around who could give him a serious workout. Yet many of the traditionalmartial arts fraternity saw Bruce as an upstart whose methods were little morethan glorified street fighting. Bruce himself had no misgivings about hisabilities and he took great delight in pointing out the shortcomings of the moretraditional approaches to the fighting arts. He even had a mock grave completewith tombstone installed in the school. The inscription on it read: ‘In memoryof the once fluid man, crammed and distorted by the classical mess’.From the outset, Bruce stressed that training had to relate as much as possibleto actual combat and to situations that might be encountered on the streets,using only the simplest and most effective moves. Bruce said the best way todevelop the power to punch and kick was simply to keep punching and kicking.Likewise the best training for fighting was to fight, or at least to practisethe nearest thing, which was to pad up and spar all out. There was nothingsophisticated about it, and there were certainly no rules. When he was dismissedas a brawler by many of the traditional martial arts fraternity, Bruce wouldexplain that not adhering to set methods didn’t mean he was unskilled or withoutform. It meant that he was not limited to what he’d practised but couldimprovise and adapt.Bruce’s attitude to fighting brings to mind a scene from the film Butch Cassidyand the Sundance Kid. Cassidy, played by Paul Newman, is about to fight a rivalfor the leadership of an outlaw gang. Just as they’re squaring up, Newman asksinnocently, ‘Just a minute, what rules are we having?’ His tough opponentreplies indignantly, ‘No rules!’ The words have hardly left his lips whenCassidy’s boot hits him in the groin. As he buckles in pain and drops to thefloor, we can see him trying desperately to say that he hadn’t meant it likethat, coupled with the awful realization that he’d just been outwitted. BruceLee would certainly have enjoyed that scene.Bruce Lee practised and taught what was necessary to win simply andscientifically. The difference between the classical martial arts and BruceLee’s evolving fighting method had become as radical as the difference betweeneighteenth-century soldiers fighting in rank-and-file formation and the methodsof modern guerrilla warfare.Throughout the 1960s Bruce assimilated as much knowledge and experience as hecould about every aspect of fighting he could use. He amassed an extensivelibrary, paying as much as $400 for a rare book. As long as a book had somethingto do with fighting, he bought it. Bruce placed great value on his books; hedidn’t regard them merely as possessions but as treasuries of knowledge. Hewould study a new book intently, analysing its fighting techniques to find theweaknesses by acting them out. Although he never practised karate, he knew thenames of all the techniques in Japanese and could demonstrate them. Not only didBruce have books on every type of hand-to-hand fighting art, but also onarchery, ballet and fencing. His books on philosophy concerned not only theinsights of Chinese sages like Confucius and Lao Tzu, there were also works byKrishnamurti, Spinoza and Kahlil Gibran, along with popular psychology books onself-help and positive thinking by writers like Norman Vincent Peale andNapoleon Hill.Bruce also collected films of Joe Louis, Rocky Marciano, Max Baer, Gene Tunney,Jack Dempsey, Muhammad Ali and other great boxers. Bruce used to watch Ali’sfilms over and over to analyse and imitate his movements. As an orthodox boxer,Ali led with his left hand. Since Bruce was experimenting with a right leadstance, he set up a mirror so he could watch Ali’s movements and practise themthe appropriate way.The first time Bruce put on boxing gloves, as a teenager, he became aninter-schools champion, beating the three-year title holder. He had fenced withhis brother Peter, a Commonwealth Games champion, and done some tai chi with hisfather. He had trained intensively in wing chun while being involved in almostdaily street fights in Hong Kong. Before coming to America he learned forms fromother styles of kung fu, such as choy li fut, eagle claw and hung gar. Soonafter arriving in the US he had visited his father in New York and trained withthe praying-mantis master Gin Foon Mark. Bruce had met with Wally Jay, a judoand ju-jitsu exponent who was responsible for many innovations in that field,and he had become close friends with karate and kung fu pioneer James Yimm Lee.He’d practised judo with Taky Kimura, Fred Sato and Jesse Glover. He had trainedin Filipino martial arts with Dan Inosanto and travelled to meet withinstructors in other styles. The champion wrestler Gene LeBell played Bruce’spatsy in many episodes of The Green Hornet and the two had become close friendsand traded techniques. He had worked with karate champions Bob Wall, ChuckNorris, Mike Stone and Joe Lewis. He’d tried Thai boxing, Western boxing, savate(French foot-fighting) and had learned a few dirty tricks for good measure. Fromthis potent cocktail of diverse influences emerged his modern and unorthodoxfighting method.‘After I went back to college on the East Coast and Bruce moved, we saw eachother only occasionally, on vacations,’ says Doug Palmer. ‘Each time there was anotable change. I watched him evolve over the years; I couldn’t see how he couldever have any more than he already had, but each time he acquired new theoriesand techniques that became part of an expanded vision.’Dan Inosanto adds, ‘There were thirteen things on a list that I was allowed toteach, and that was it. He used to say that under no circumstances could I teachdouble pak sao [double slapping block]; pak sao, bil jee [slap block and fingerjab]; or pak sao, larp sao [slap block, grabbing hand]. These restrictedtechniques were all pure wing chun and were big secrets. He was the head man, soI kept it exactly the way he wanted me to teach it.‘Bruce kept a lot of things to himself. He was into chi development, and thefirst thing on his schedule was meditation. What I’m trying to say is that hesort of pointed his students in one direction and pointed himself in another. Hewas heavily into what I call esoteric studies. I know that he had a lot ofliterature on it and he studied acupuncture, but he kept a lot of these thingsto himself. He also programmed his mind by repeating affirmations over and overagain to raise his martial art skill to the highest level.’Joe Lewis thinks Bruce had two agendas: ‘One, to build up his stature as aninstructor by working with world champs like myself, Mike Stone and ChuckNorris; and two, to get into movies by working privately with big-namedirectors, producers, writers and actors. That was a smart move, ’cos it paidoff.’The fact that Bruce could teach only a handful of people at any one time meantthat he had long ago given up the idea of opening a nationwide chain of gung fuacademies. At the same time, while striving to perfect his art and convey itsessence to others, he was driven to fulfil his ambitions. He realized all overagain that he had to break out of teaching and bring his art and abilities to amuch wider audience. He knew he had to make it as a film actor."},{"pageContent":" 15THE WARRIORAlong with his partner Tom Kuhn, Fred Weintraub runs an independent productioncompany in Century City, Los Angeles. In 1968, Weintraub was head of WarnerBrothers’ film division and Kuhn was in charge of television.Weintraub remembers, ‘At that time I used to spend time looking at Chinesemovies. They were four hours long and boring as shit, but in the last thirtyminutes a guy in white came in and defeated all the bad guys. Because of thatinterest, friends introduced me to Bruce Lee and we became friends. I hired twoyoung writers [Ed Spielman and Howard Friedlander] and tried to put a featuretogether for Bruce, but I could never get anything off the ground.’Bruce Lee himself had already spent some time working on an idea concerning theadventures of a Shaolin warrior priest who used kung fu skills against theoutlaws of the old West. Eventually his idea found its way over to Tom Kuhn, whosuggested a TV movie as a pilot for a possible series, with the working titleThe Warrior.By now, Bruce had attracted several more celebrity students, including the actorJames Coburn and screenwriters Stirling Silliphant and Joe Hyams. Silliphant wasone of the most highly regarded and successful writer/producers in Hollywood. Hehad written the cult TV series Route 66, and his credits eventually included TheTowering Inferno, The Poseidon Adventure, and an Oscar for In the Heat of theNight. Despite the fact that he hired lots of actors, Silliphant had greatdifficulty getting to Bruce, and to become his pupil he had to go through whatwas, in effect, an audition.Bruce Lee first came to Silliphant’s attention through a story that was makingthe rounds in Hollywood. The story went that Bruce had met the singer Vic Damonein his Las Vegas hotel suite after one of the singer’s performances. Damone hadan interest in the martial arts, but the singer insisted that a tough Italianstreet brawler would always beat a slightly built Oriental. Damone had two hugebodyguards who also had a low opinion of the martial arts and they were enlistedto prove the point.Bruce agreed to be tested and asked that one guard be placed behind the door tothe suite, with the second man about five feet behind him, smoking a cigarette.Bruce explained that when he came through the door, the first man was to try andstop him. The cigarette was there to represent a holstered gun. Bruce toldDamone that before the singer could count to five, he would be through the doorand knock the cigarette from the second guy’s mouth. Bruce had given them afurther advantage by telling them exactly what he was going to do, forfeitingthe element of surprise.‘If I succeed,’ said Bruce, ‘will you take this as an acceptable example of theeffectiveness of the martial arts?’‘Sure,’ came the disdainful reply.Bruce left the room and the singer told his guards to go easy on the littleChinese guy. ‘Just knock him on his ass with one good shot.’Suddenly there was a loud wrench as the door flew clear off its hinges, takingthe first guard with it, then Bruce followed through by kicking the cigaretteout of the second guard’s mouth while he was frozen in place.The singer only managed the comment, ‘Holy shit.’After three months of searching, Silliphant succeeded in finding Bruce, via theGreen Hornet producer William Dozier. In an August 1980 article for KickIllustrated, Stirling Silliphant wrote in detail about their meeting and theevents that followed:Bruce had a school in the Chinese center of Los Angeles. It was very lowprofile, with no exterior signs. You had to know its location in advance and youhad to be invited; you couldn’t just walk in off the street. So first I had totrack Bruce down. Eventually, I called Bill Dozier, the producer of The GreenHornet, which by that time had already gone off the air. He put me in touch withsomeone who knew where he was.I called him and said, ‘I’ve been looking for you for three months; I want tostudy with you.’Bruce said, ‘Well, I don’t really teach; I only have one or two privatestudents.’Aside from Steve McQueen and maybe one or two others, Bruce wasn’t into teachingprivately. In order to discourage Hollywood dilettantes he charged $250 an hour.He wanted to make the cost of lessons prohibitive so that whoever took one woulddamn well concentrate on the business in hand. He didn’t charge these pricesjust for the sake of charging, but to place value on his instruction. It was anAsian attitude, a way of showing that the lesson has worth and the fee is merelythe token of this, not the point of it.I recall the moment of my first meeting with Bruce above all others. He arrivedat my office at Columbia Pictures on Gower Street like the winds around theoutside of a hurricane. At the time I was about fifty, but not flabby; I was inpretty good shape but nothing like the condition I was later to achieve afterthree years training with him. Bruce asked how old I was. When I told him he wasappalled, even though he added, grudgingly, that I didn’t look that old. He saidhe didn’t know if he wanted to teach anyone that old, it seemed pointless. Butthen he added that it wasn’t unusual for people in China to begin training inmartial arts at the age of sixty and said that it would depend on my speed andreflexes.So he brought out a catcher’s mitt.He said, ‘I’m going to hold this out. Hit it as hard as you can.’So I did. I used all my boxing knowledge, torqued my hips and gave it my bestshot.‘Man, that sure wouldn’t hurt anyone, would it?’ was his response.So I tried again.‘I will say that you’ve got speed and your reflexes are good,’ he conceded. ‘ButI have to tell you, you could hit someone and they wouldn’t even know it. I cantell we’ve got a lot of work to do with you.’Even so, he agreed to start instructing me, but I think it was because of myenthusiasm more than anything else.The first time I went to Bruce’s house in Culver City there were some peoplefrom his downtown studio; they were nearly all young Chinese. The entirepractice session was devoted to timing. Bruce wanted to determine how long itwould take for each of us, from a given instant, to close the gap to a heavy bagand land what he considered an effective kick. He wanted to see what we wouldhave done in a real situation. The difference in timing among us all wasamazing. I found, to my ego’s delight, that of everyone there, even though I wastwenty or thirty years older than those downtown dudes, I had the fastest time.I often went to his house in Culver City; at this point we were working outthree or four times a week. No matter how hard I worked, how much I exercised,how much I sparred, or how much I ran, I never stopped aching. I mean, therewere times when I woke up in the morning and wished I was dead, so overwhelmingand total was the pain from every aching muscle. I remember arriving at Bruce’shouse one day and being unable to get out of my car. When I started to move myleg to get out, the pain exploded through my whole body. That’s how wracked-up Iwas from these workouts.Bruce finally came out and said, ‘What are you sitting there for?’I said, ‘I can’t move, I ache too much.’He pulled the car door open and said, ‘Get out!’Well, when you’re dealing with a master you get out fast, because you know thatif you don’t he’s going to pull you out and it’s going to hurt even more. So,painfully, I pulled myself out of the car.Bruce then said, ‘You know, in ten minutes you’re going to feel great. Whatyou’re doing is like diving into a cold ocean with a wet suit on. There’s thatfirst shock of cold, then everything warms up. The first minute you test all ofyour muscles, they’re going to hurt. After that you’ll feel better.’He was right, of course.I found his training methods fascinating. His methods changed with every lessonhe taught. They weren’t structured, always spontaneous and improvisational. Thefirst thing he did with me was concentrate on body movement and ‘bridging thegap’, the relationship between you and your opponent. Then we started on thehand movements. He wanted to introduce me to the historic background on the useof hands, wrists and arms. Bruce always said that the leg is the more powerfulweapon, but the one who can punch best will win.He taught me the wing chun sticking hands technique and we did that blindfold.Joe Hyams and I found it fascinating that when we were blindfolded and followedBruce’s instructions, we felt the power of this defense. It was almostimpossible for anyone to force his way through to the target, into your face orbody. The more he forced, the more you reached him. The sticking hands help aweaker person to nullify an attack by a stronger person. If you are really goodat it, it’s almost impenetrable, extremely difficult for an opponent to land ablow above the waist, which in turn might force the opponent into a low-lineattack, for which you’re prepared.Bruce taught me to dissect time into infinite degrees. It’s what he calledplaying between the keys of the piano. It’s the understanding that you actuallyhave worlds of time within seconds to do something unanticipated while youropponent is already committed to his announced [telegraphed] action. Almost tothe point where the fist is at the tip of your nose, there’s still time toreact. The only thing that can defeat you is lack of understanding andappropriate movement based on this principle. You must do a helluva lot of workto arrive at this stage of cool thinking. But if you can attain it, you won’t bedefeated just because an opponent is bigger, stronger or meaner, only if hethinks in the way you do.Bruce and I were working out in his garage one day. He had a few friends fromHong Kong there who were exponents of sticking hands. Bruce wanted to see what Icould do with these guys. So we put on soft gloves, because he wanted us to sparfull contact, and he disallowed any kicking. So we went at it. By that time Ihad been with Bruce for nearly two years and I found it embarrassingly easy tohit these guys, to the point where I did so at will. I was hitting each opponentcontinually in the face, and I wasn’t being hit myself. Bruce told me later thatboth of his friends had been disgraced, but he was so proud of having taught me.I won because of the spontaneous reaction [contact reflex] that he’d instilledin me – instinctive, spontaneous reaction without conscious thought.Once when Bruce was accompanying Stirling Silliphant on a three-mile run,towards the end Bruce said that they should do a couple of extra miles. Thewriter protested that he was older and couldn’t do it, and after an extra fiveminutes’ running, Silliphant’s head was pounding.‘If I run any more, I’ll have a heart attack and die,’ he gasped.‘Then die!’ said Bruce.This made Silliphant so mad that he went the extra miles.Later, in the showers, Bruce explained. ‘If you always put limits on yourselfand what you can do, physical or otherwise, you might as well be dead. It willspread over into your work, your morality, your entire being. There are nolimits, only plateaux. But you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. Ifit kills you, it kills you.’During 1968 and 1969, Stirling Silliphant succeeded in getting Bruce somebit-part acting work. He made minor appearances in TV episodes of the detectiveseries Ironside, in which he played a martial arts teacher, and the sitcomBlondie. In Here Come the Brides Bruce had a non-fighting cameo role, and he wasalso the technical advisor for the Matt Helm detective thriller The WreckingCrew, which starred Dean Martin and Roman Polanski’s wife, Sharon Tate.Despite Silliphant and others being willing to help him, there weren’t that manyopportunities. There were very few parts in Hollywood that called for Chineseactors outside of the usual stereotypes. Silliphant realized that Bruce wouldneed something to be written especially for him, then they would have toovercome the problem of getting a studio to back the idea with hard cash.Silliphant was just completing a script for A Walk in the Spring Rain forColumbia, in which Anthony Quinn and Ingrid Bergman were set to star. Althoughit was a love story, Silliphant contrived to include a fight sequence, theproblem being that the story was set in the mountains of Tennessee, where therearen’t that many Chinese martial artists! In the end he managed to get Bruceinvolved by having him choreograph the fight. This wasn’t simply for Bruce’sbenefit, though, it was also so that Silliphant could continue his trainingschedule.Just as happened with Vic Damone’s bodyguards, Bruce’s ability was openlydoubted by the two rough rednecks whose fight Bruce was due to supervise.Silliphant elected to clear a few things up straightaway and organize ademonstration, which resulted in the two stuntmen being side-kicked, in turn,almost clear across a swimming pool.Eventually Silliphant did manage to write an acting part for Bruce, that ofWinslow Wong in the 1969 detective feature Marlowe, and although Bruce was onlyin a couple of scenes, it marked his debut appearance in a full-length Hollywoodpicture. The film starred James Garner as the hard-boiled private detectivePhilip Marlowe, in a script based on Raymond Chandler’s novel The Little Sister.In the story, Bruce works as a heavy for the villain of the piece, and one scenewas specifically written to show off Bruce’s athleticism. He comes in to smashup Garner’s office, culminating in a stunning kick high above his head toshatter a light fixture. After that, Marlowe’s handling of Bruce Lee’s characteris quite unrealistic and unconvincing. Standing on the edge of a balcony hetaunts Wong by casting doubts on his manhood, then simply steps aside to avoidthe flying kick that sends Wong sailing off the edge of the roof to his death.Aside from the acting jobs cooked up by Stirling Silliphant, Bruce’s only incomewas from his teaching and a trickle of royalties from The Green Hornet, yetdespite money problems and with Linda pregnant again, Bruce decided it was timeto buy a new house. At first he set the budget at $30,000, but soon realizedthat it fell far short of what he had in mind. Bruce felt the need to provide agood life for his growing family, and it was difficult for him to admit that hecouldn’t afford it. He also felt that he belonged with his successful friends inthe movie business, so reasoning that it was only a matter of time before hejoined them, he went to look over a bungalow just off Mulholland Drive in theupmarket Bel Air district.Mulholland Drive winds and dips for twenty miles along the crest of a ridge thatruns from Hollywood to the Pacific Coast at Malibu through some of the mostdesirable real estate in Los Angeles. To the north, there are views across theSan Fernando Valley, while to the south lie the canyons and spectacular vistasof the city and ocean. The Bel Air estate is entered through gates on SunsetBoulevard or Mulholland Drive. Roscomare Road is lined with detached bungalows,with gardens of cypress, bougainvillea and hibiscus. There are no sidewalks,because no one walks in Bel Air. The air is warm and still and there’s a feelingof space and calm. There can’t be many better places to live in any city.Although it needed work done, Bruce bought the bungalow at 2551 Roscomare Roadand hung his training bags under the eaves at the back, but at $47,000 he was inway over his head and was soon struggling to meet the mortgage repayments. Ontop of this, the running costs were much higher than he was used to, so hedidn’t have any money left to furnish it properly. To add to his problems, theInternal Revenue Service was knocking on the front door . . . which had yet tobe repainted. Yet when Bruce received a windfall of $8,000 from the sale of oneof his father’s properties in Hong Kong, instead of buying furniture or payingthe bills, he bought a red Porsche and went racing along Mulholland Drive withSteve McQueen.In a long letter dated 6 January 1969, Bruce Lee wrote to William Cheung, whowas now living in Australia. He updated his friend on his activities over theprevious ten years, discussing his career as a martial artist and his morerecent forays into acting. He described his achievements in the field of martialarts as ‘the most satisfying’ to him, and he was justifiably proud that theimportance of Chinese martial arts was now recognized thanks to the fact thatall three American karate champions were studying under him. He went on to admitthat he had lost faith in the traditional forms of Chinese martial arts, evenwing chun, because ‘basically, all styles are a form of land swimming’. Insteadhe was teaching a form that was closer to ‘efficient street fighting witheverything goes, wearing head gear, gloves, chest guard, shin and knee guards,etc.’ Telling William he was calling this style jeet kune do, he wrote that thecreation of this new style was ‘a major event in my life’.He went on to say, ‘I’ve been doing good too in the field of acting’ and toldWilliam about The Green Hornet as well as his most recent role in MGM’s LittleSister, which was due to be released later that year. He informed his friendthat he was setting up a production company ‘with a few important backers herein the States’ which would focus on producing martial art films and televisionseries. Describing his home in Bel Air, which was perched on top of a hill, hejoked that while he might be enjoying plenty of fresh air, running up and downthe hillside was ‘tough on the calves’.Despite the upbeat tone of his letter, Bruce was only too aware that he had moreto do than simply convince his old friends that he was now a great success.Although he had always taken a fiercely positive attitude to life, whether hecalled it faith, confidence, determination, ambition or a vision that thingswould work out, no longer mattered. Bruce Lee had spent sixteen long yearsdeveloping his skills and perfecting an art that, so far, no more than a handfulof people had benefited from, and he had just spent $47,000 on a new home. Now,things just had to work out."},{"pageContent":" 16THE SILENT FLUTEIn the habit of making predictions about his future, Bruce Lee said that hewould make kung fu known throughout the world, but he also knew beyond any doubtthat the only way he could do this was by making films. Though he had allies,the fact that they agreed that he had all the qualities needed but could find nooutlet for them only made things worse. In addition, Bruce also had the samedirectness in the film world that he had with the martial arts fraternity: healways said exactly what he thought. Sadly this didn’t win him many new friendsin an industry whose wheels run smoother when oiled by bullshit. Nobody knewquite what to do with him, and more to the point, nobody was willing to riskmoney on an unknown actor who also happened to be Chinese. More than once itmust have made Bruce question why he’d fought against his own countrymen for theright to teach kung fu to Westerners.If an opportunity wasn’t going to arise naturally, then just as his motivationhad created his abilities, so it would also create the opportunities to usethem. In short, he would go to Hollywood with a film. Bruce realized that astarring role was out of the question, but reasoned that a stronger supportingrole than the one he’d had in Marlowe would reveal enough of his talents to openthe door further. He already had an idea for a film which he had quite literallydreamed up.For some years, Bruce had been having a recurring dream about ‘a seeker’, acharacter who he’d come to realize was himself, and these dreams had left enoughof an impression for him to have made a few notes about them. Bruce wanted touse these notes as the basis of a screenplay, which he now asked StirlingSilliphant to write.The Silent Flute would tell the story of a martial artist called Cord who seeksa book which is said to contain the ultimate truths about fighting. Every fiveyears a competition is held to pass it on to another person. When Cord finallyobtains it, he has no need to look inside: the journey itself has been hisenlightenment. Along the way he has to fight battles with a number ofcharacters, all of whom represent his different weaknesses, and all of thesecharacters were to be played by Bruce Lee.Rhythm Man is a skilled martial artist who travels with several musicians, andhis greatest asset is the broken rhythm of his movements, which he uses toconfuse opponents. Monkey Man is a fighter who is known to gouge out eyeballs;the fight with him is brutal and it serves to unite Cord with his animalinstincts. A fierce growl signifies the entrance into the story of Panther Man,who represents the fear of death. Ah Sahm, a blind flute player and martialartist, meets with Cord at different points until it’s revealed that he is notan enemy but a projection of Cord’s enlightened self, drawing him forward. Onedisturbing scene involves Ah Sahm killing a child, who he says would have grownup to be a tyrant.After Cord has proved himself, he meets with the book’s current holder,Yamaguchi. Various other seekers attempt to defeat him, but it is not until Cordengages him that he discovers the secret. Cord and Yamaguchi engage eye contactand stare at each other until Yamaguchi concedes that Cord’s spirit is thestronger, telling him that the highest form of fighting is no fighting at all,as Cord is presented with the book. Although the lead role would be played by astar name, it was already clear that Bruce was going to dominate the action.Bruce wanted Steve McQueen to play the starring role of Cord, so he andSilliphant went to talk to the actor. McQueen, who had never really stuck to thediscipline of training with Bruce, made the excuse that he was too busy, but asBruce became more enthusiastic and pressed him to get involved, the real reasonemerged.‘Be honest,’ said McQueen, ‘this is a film to make Bruce Lee into a star. I likeyou, but I’m not here to make you a star. I’m not going to carry you on myback.’McQueen’s words burned so deeply they would never be forgotten, though Brucesaid nothing and he and Silliphant left soon after.Outside, he turned to Silliphant and said, ‘I’m going to be bigger than he is.’Then, more quietly, he repeated the same vow to himself.The two went back to James Coburn and told him the situation. Coburn said he waswith them and offered to play the lead role himself, but now it was Silliphant’sturn to get cold feet and try to pull back from the project, saying he wasalready up to his ears with writing commitments.The Silent Flute began as an idea to make a definitive martial arts film whichwould give Bruce the exposure he needed, but now other pressures were mountingand there was more at stake. Not only was Bruce becoming increasingly concernedabout getting his break in pictures, his income from teaching and bit partsdidn’t cover his huge mortgage. Bruce needed to make some money soon or he’d bein danger of losing the house. The Silent Flute went from being a good idea to anecessity to an obsession. When it began to look as if the whole project wouldhave to be abandoned, Bruce became distraught. He was about to lose both hischance of stardom and his ability to provide for his family. He always tried topicture the best possible outcome of any situation and not dwell on the morefearful possibilities, but his concerns became more acute with the birth of hisdaughter Shannon on 19 April 1969.In an attempt to solve everybody’s problems it was agreed that he should hire ascriptwriter to develop his ideas with Silliphant and Coburn, putting up the$12,000 fee. The new writer, however, managed to lose most of Bruce’s plot byturning it into a jumble of science fiction and sex. He was fired andSilliphant’s nephew had a try. Again, none of the three was happy with theoutcome. As Silliphant saw Bruce becoming increasingly desperate he finally gavein and proposed a regular writing session three nights a week to dictate theirideas to his secretary. No excuses for absence would be accepted. Although thiswork was purely speculative, they met without fail at the appointed times, andbefore long a story began to come alive.Despite the financial crisis looming, things were moving along well. Then onemorning, as Bruce began his morning workout, he felt a stab of pain in his lowerback and the barbell across his shoulders went crashing to the floor. Over thefollowing days, heat and massage treatment brought no relief and the pain grewsteadily worse until a doctor’s examination was necessary. The final diagnosiswasn’t good: Bruce had damaged a sacral nerve and was experiencing a severemuscle spasm. He asked the obvious question: how long would it be before hecould start training again? The doctor advised complete rest.Bruce found himself flat on his back, unable even to support himself upright,let alone support a family in a house he couldn’t pay for. Meanwhile the billsbegan piling up. It wasn’t simply that Bruce could no longer train or practiseas a martial artist: he felt he had no future. To anyone, let alone someone withBruce’s energy and ambition, such a situation would be a nightmare. Only a fewmonths earlier, it was Hollywood that had no idea what to do with Bruce Lee, nowBruce Lee had no idea what to do with himself. For perhaps the first time in hislife, Bruce was truly frightened.As he tried to acknowledge and go with his injury rather than resist it, he feltboth his autonomy and self-esteem being eroded. At times he was close toexploding with frustration. For several weeks, he lived between the bed and thechair at his desk, fighting depression by drawing plans for a bed that wouldhelp him rest his injury better. He also began to write down the precepts bywhich he lived and worked, collating his notes, which were written in succinctparagraphs derived both from his own experiences and from the books where hefound vital information or inspiration.Unable to fight physically, just like the hero of The Silent Flute, Bruce had tobattle his fears and doubts using his strength of will and mastery of hisemotions. He thought that only through his self-belief would things work out, sohe battled every negative thought as it arose by visualizing it written on apiece of paper, which he then mentally crushed into a ball and burned to acrisp. Every inner voice that said ‘I can’t’ was replaced with one that said ‘Ican.’ Every image of failure was replaced with one of success. Bruce once toldJoe Hyams that he considered the mind a fertile garden in which anything that’splanted – flowers or weeds – will grow. One of the most well-thumbed books inBruce’s library was Napoleon Hill’s The Law of Success, and lesson six of thisbook counsels the positive use of the imagination and affirmation by creating a‘definite chief aim’.In one of his darkest hours, Bruce sat down and wrote out the following:MY DEFINITE CHIEF AIMI, Bruce Lee, will be the first highest-paid Oriental superstar in the UnitedStates. In return I will give the most exciting performances and render the bestof quality in the capacity of an actor. Starting 1970, I will achieve world fameand from then onwards till the end of 1980 I will have in my possession$10,000,000. I will live the way I please and achieve inner harmony andhappiness.Bruce Lee, 1969Having done that Bruce simply got up and began to train and teach again. Whileeveryone assumed that he’d recovered, he was still in agonizing pain, he wasjust willing himself to carry on as if everything was all right.At the invitation of his friend, tae kwon do pioneer Jhoon Rhee – who wanted tohelp get Bruce back on track – in early 1970 they made a brief promotional visitto the Dominican Republic. Bruce enjoyed the unpretentious character of theDominicans but was exhausted by the constant attention of the children, whoswarmed around him everywhere they went, after the success The Green Hornet hadenjoyed there. Bruce took advantage of this by swiftly setting up an exhaustinground of exhibitions, interviews and promotional appearances.In one TV interview he responded to a question about his acting career:In terms of films, I’ve been in Marlowe and The Green Hornet TV series, as wellas appearing as a guest in several others. Presently we have plans to make amovie with James Coburn, the star of Our Man Flint, and it will be the firstmartial arts picture ever filmed in the United States of America. The entiremovie will be about martial arts, and I will supervise the script.But during Bruce’s dark times, Stirling Silliphant had quietly completed thescript for The Silent Flute and presented it to Warner Brothers. The studio waswilling to give it a shot, but only so long as the film was made in India, inorder to free up money that previous Warners pictures had earned there but whichthe Indian government would not allow them to take out of the country. As Brucebegan planning the trip Coburn and Silliphant shot each other a sidelong glance.Almost a year after the idea for the film was first dreamed up, Bruce Lee, JamesCoburn and Stirling Silliphant flew to India to scout for locations. They landedin Bombay, flew on to New Delhi, then hired a car and driver to take them north,over dirt roads and through searing heat. From the moment they started looking,they knew that enormous changes would need to be made to the script so that itfitted in with the Indian scenery. An ominous feeling came over Silliphant andCoburn. Drawing on their extensive experience, they realized that filming inIndia wasn’t going to work. Bruce, who’d never travelled much outside of HongKong and the West Coast, had no idea of the production problems involved andwouldn’t allow the others to convince him it was a lost cause. Instead he urgedthem to keep looking and they continued driving north. Through long hours ofheat, dust and bumpy roads, Bruce suffered constant back pain, while Coburn andSilliphant sat with heavy hearts. When the friendly humour wore a little thin,they would sleep for a while, then Bruce would begin to talk about the filmagain. Tensions soon surfaced.On the road, Coburn always sat up front with the driver while Silliphant rode inthe back with Bruce. Bruce had a habit of singing quietly to himself as theydrove and his favourite tune at the time was ‘Yesterday’. No doubt he wasthinking about the time when all his own troubles seemed so far away, but hissinging irritated Coburn until eventually he snapped, ‘Stop that! You’re drivingme crazy!’Bruce joked with Coburn that his voice was rich because it was ‘well off!’ Butas Coburn turned to look down the long road ahead, Bruce shook his fist at theback of Coburn’s head.As the trip wore on the two drifted further apart, and by the time they reachedthe northern border of India, Silliphant and Coburn were more than ready to callit quits. Bruce, however, was not. He was feeling desperate now; everything –his career, his dreams, his whole life – was at stake, and for this reason only,Coburn and Silliphant got on a plane with Bruce and flew south to Madras, whereBruce was convinced they would find the locations they were looking for.From Madras they went to Goa, where they found hippies from all over the worldon the beach. Bruce used the opportunity to put on impromptu displays of hisskills for the locals. Whenever there was an audience, Bruce Lee the entertainercame alive, but this only became a further source of tension between him andCoburn, who wanted to keep a low profile, while Bruce took any opportunity toshow off. In airports, Coburn would sit quietly reading while Bruce attracted anaudience of children and put on a quick show of fighting moves or dexteritytricks. Unused to seeing Chinese people, they would gape as he ran through a fewmoves, then burst into applause. Almost seeing his future dissolve before hiseyes, perhaps Bruce felt he had to do something to prove he still had appeal.When the three returned to Bombay from Goa to the Taj Mahal Hotel, Bruce wasgiven a room not much better than the one he’d had at Ruby Chow’s, whileCoburn’s spacious suite was bigger than the hotel’s dining room. Coburn was aninternational star accustomed to this kind of treatment from hotel management,but Bruce could no longer stand the blows to his pride, and that evening hevowed that he would be a bigger star than both Steve McQueen and James Coburn.For nearly a month the three had travelled the length and breadth of India, andnow that they were going home, the only thing they could agree on was that thetrip to India had failed. But while Silliphant and Coburn had successful careersto resume, Bruce had nothing. He was even more desperate now; this had been hisonly hope and he couldn’t let it go. To hell with locations, he said, hisdetermination would make it work.Coburn was against making the picture in India, citing artistic reasons, butSilliphant thought they should try and pull something together because hisinstincts told him the time was right for a martial arts picture. Bruce neededthe picture to be made at all costs, but in the end, Coburn’s decision not toremain involved caused Warner Brothers to withdraw their support.Back in America, with no money coming into the Lee household, both Coburn andSilliphant offered Bruce financial help, but he would have none of it. His pridetook a further blow when Linda suggested she return to work. Being Chinese, theinjury to his pride at being offered charity and being unable to support hisfamily was doubly painful, but in the end he had to agree that there was noother way.To save Bruce’s pride further, it was agreed that no one else would find outabout the arrangement. With neither qualifications nor experience, Linda couldonly get a minimum wage job. After a day parenting and managing the household,she worked from late afternoon to midnight, and soon her health began to suffer.Once Bruce had put Brandon and baby Shannon to bed, he spent the long eveninghours alone reading, writing or in enforced contemplation, his back still rackedwith pain. It was not the best of times."},{"pageContent":" 17LONGSTREETDespite the failed trip to India, Stirling Silliphant again tried to help liftBruce’s career by writing a part for him in the pilot show for a new TV seriescalled Longstreet. Silliphant had begun work on the script before they left forIndia, when Bruce was still frustrated by the delays with The Warrior, and theepisode was even titled ‘Way of the Intercepting Fist’. Written with help fromBruce, the story portrayed him as a martial arts instructor who teaches a blinddetective how to defend himself. Silliphant then approached the head ofParamount TV, Tom Tannenbaum, who was in charge of developing the series and whotrained in karate with Ed Parker, so had seen the Bruce Lee demonstration at the1966 Long Beach International Karate Tournament.Tannenbaum recalls:I was very impressed with him and wanted to meet him. The kung fu or jeet kunedo – whatever he was doing back then – I’d never seen before. Someone else inthe industry had seen him perform at an earlier tournament and had tested himfor the role in The Green Hornet. I got hold of a copy of that screen test andagain was very impressed. He had an intensity in his eyes and he was extremelyconfident.I called him up and told him I’d like to take lessons. Bruce said, ‘Come on downto my school in Chinatown at nine o’clock on Sunday morning. Knock twice on thedoor.’ So I did. There was a little spy panel on the door, which slid open andBruce let me in. There was a small class going on, and as I waited I saw anotice on his desk which read, ‘Show me a classical karateist and I’ll show youa dead man.’Then he came over and said, ‘I’m going to hold this catcher’s mitt; you hit it.’I weighed about 200 pounds and Bruce, at that time, weighed about 132. I hit it,and I hit it hard. Bruce said, ‘Now you hold it.’ Without even pulling hisstriking hand back, just using the torque of his body, he literally knocked meacross the room. In fact, I hit the wall so hard a picture fell down. It wasembarrassing, because all the students in the class looked at me. I wasfascinated: I’d never met a man who weighed almost seventy pounds less than mebut could knock me across the room.Bruce said, ‘That’s the power. Now I’ll show you the speed.’ He put a nickel inmy palm and said, ‘Close your fingers before I grab it out of your hand.’ Hemoved like lightning and I quickly clenched my fingers. When I opened my hand,the nickel was gone and in its place was a dime. That’s all I had to see. Isaid, ‘That’s fine, I’m yours.’ So I started taking lessons from Bruce.In Silliphant’s script, Mike Longstreet, played by James Franciscus, is presentduring a murder; but he’s blind and can’t make a positive identification on theevidence of his hearing alone. He tracks down the killer, a tough longshoreman,and plans to unmask him. Bruce plays an antiques dealer named Li who saves theblind detective from being forced off the dock by a gang. Longstreet wants toknow how Li managed to do it and wants to learn how to fight like him and goafter the killer. Li refuses, saying he has the wrong motives, but as the storydevelops, Li begins to teach Longstreet, working both on his attitude to lifeand on a fighting method, in preparation for the coming confrontation. Now Bruceonly had to wait, yet again, for filming to begin.In the meantime, Bruce took Brandon with him to Hong Kong to arrange for hismother to come and live in the US. But when he arrived in Hong Kong, he wasastonished at the welcome he received. Twentieth Century Fox, anxious to turn aprofit from what had been a relatively unsuccessful TV series in the States, hadrecently marketed The Green Hornet in Hong Kong and throughout Southeast Asia,three years after it had first been aired in America. When dubbed in Mandarin,the show broke ratings figures in Singapore and the Philippines, and it wasKato, not the Hornet, who was its acknowledged star. Much to Bruce’s surprise,when he stepped off the plane he was surrounded by TV and newspaper reportersready to boast of the local boy made good.Hong Kong newspapers, radio and TV stations clamoured for interviews, and Bruce,along with Brandon, appeared on talk shows on Hong Kong’s two TV stations. Oneshow host, Joseph Lau, persuaded Bruce to overcome his aversion to doing tricksand Bruce leapt, kicked and broke four one-inch boards dangling in the air. Thenfive-year-old Brandon managed to break one almost as big as himself. After ayear of inactivity, dreading that it might all be going wrong, Bruce’s charm,wit and star quality were suddenly on tap again.Seizing the moment, Bruce sent his boyhood friend Unicorn to probe hisemployers, the Shaw Brothers film studios, about a possible film offer. Brucegave Unicorn information about his schools and copies of magazine articles totake to Shaw Brothers, but all the information was in English, so Unicorn firsthad to set about translating it.To Westerners at the time, Chinese films veered between being too understatedand too over-the-top, but when watching them one must remember that they are notacted realistically as Western films are. Film-making in the East stems from along theatrical tradition, and the plots, set designs, costumes, gestures andexpressions are rooted in the mime traditions of theatres like the CantoneseOpera Company, for whom Bruce’s father used to act. If a comparison can be made,similar elements are seen in the silent movies of Hollywood.The Hong Kong film industry made these films the way Detroit made cars: on anassembly line, wrapping up a normal production in three days while a big-budgetextravaganza might require a week. The Shaw Brothers – Runjy, Runme and Run Run– had almost singlehandedly set up the Hong Kong film industry and were thebiggest studio outside of Hollywood and Europe, accounting for two thirds of theChinese films produced in the world. Shaw Brothers Studios were a mixture ofpurpose-built sets and sound stages, where everything from pagodas toconcentration camps was perched on a windy hillside overlooking Clearwater Bay.An average of seven features were permanently in production and thesound-dubbing rooms were shared on a tight schedule of three daily shifts.The secret of Shaw Studios’ success was a hard-nosed policy geared towards speedand economy. Films were shot without sound and, like Italian-made spaghettiWesterns, were later dubbed into whatever language was required. The films wereoften shot without a written script, being more or less made up by the crew asthey went along and edited directly on camera with few retakes. Stories werelifted straight from Western films with little or no adaptation, in what theCantonese called ‘warming up yesterday’s cold rice’. The emphasis was on ‘fistand pillow’ – violence and sex – and a director was lucky if he’d earned halfthe budget set aside to pay for the fake blood required for the more violentscenes.Like the directors, writers and production crew, actors and actresses were alsooverworked and underpaid. Even so, local prospects were so poor that there was awaiting list to join Shaw Brothers’ contract players. For a reasonable fee, RunRun Shaw would enrol them in the Southern Dramatic School – his own actingacademy – where actors were expected to provide their own lunch and transport toand from locations. Furthermore, contracts were ironclad and could only bebroken by leaving the profession or the country. With an air of benevolentpaternalism, Run Run Shaw told one interviewer that a number of actors’ suicidesand breakdowns over the years had been caused by the sudden pressures of fame,adding that he was always available to assist if it looked as if anything likethat was about to happen to one of their stars.Shaw Brothers films were guaranteed good distribution as the studio also owned140 movie theatres throughout Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwanand parts of Vietnam and Burma – known as the Mandarin circuit. They also bookedfor an additional 500 theatres, including those in the Chinatowns of SanFrancisco, Los Angeles and New York. The Shaw dynasty embraced companiesthroughout Southeast Asia, with interests in real estate, banking, insurance,breweries and amusement parks. In fact, their only serious filmmaking rival wasthe Singapore-based Cathay organization, which looked ready to give them a runfor their money until a plane crash over Taiwan claimed the lives of several ofCathay’s top executives.A slight, dapper, bespectacled man, Run Run Shaw was as sleek as he was slick.He ran his empire from a padded chair behind a desk that dwarfed him, in anelegantly austere office decorated with modern Chinese art. In the late 1960s,when one newspaper interviewer questioned Shaw about accusations of low wagesand bad conditions, he brushed the questions aside with an elegant hand. He wasmore willing to explain his approach to filmmaking, though: ‘If audiences wantviolence, we give them violence. If they want sex, we give them sex. Whateverthe audience wants, we’ll give them.’Unhappily, it would appear that Run Run could not apply the same simple credo tohis family’s requirements. He told the same interviewer how he regretted that hecould not spend more time with his grandchildren because he was compelled tospend so much time with some of his young actresses out of a strong sense ofduty to the company. Lavish parties were thrown in a house surrounded by lushgardens on a quiet corner of the huge studio lot. Shaw owned several houses andcountry villas, so naturally he required a fleet of Rolls Royces, Cadillacs andLincoln Continentals to travel between them. However Run Run did note, withgreat wisdom, that he could only travel in one of them at a time.With Bruce Lee’s translated publicity material in hand, Unicorn approached oneof Shaw’s senior executives, Mona Fong. She hadn’t heard of Bruce Lee andneither had a director who was present in her office at the time, so Unicornwent directly to Run Run himself, with Bruce’s proposal to do one picture forthe studio for a fee of $10,000. In addition, Bruce insisted on the right tomake script changes where necessary and to be solely responsible for arrangingany fight action in the proposed film. The bemused mogul didn’t know what tomake of such a strongly worded proposal; it was so far outside his experience.Ironically, Hollywood thought Bruce was too different from everyone else, whilethe Hong Kong studio thought he was just the same as all the other actors in theMandarin martial arts films that were their stock in trade.By the time Shaw responded to his proposal, Bruce had already returned to theUS, where he received a counter-proposal from Shaw in which he graciously notedBruce’s ‘modest’ success in the US and offered a seven-year contract for $2,000a film – in other words, their standard junior actor’s contract. Bruce politelydeclined.Back in the US, Bruce began work on the episode of Longstreet in which hevirtually plays himself. Entire sequences of the script amount to what is alesson in his fighting method and philosophy, which makes it one of his mostimportant works on screen.Mike Longstreet is getting a lesson in how to sidekick. Lee asks Longstreet tohold the air bag so that he can feel the depth of the kick. One of Longstreet’scolleagues arrives just in time to see the detective sailing backwards throughthe air to land in a flower bed.‘Now what exactly is . . . this thing you do?’ says the colleague.‘In Cantonese,’ replies Li, ‘jeet kune do, the way of the intercepting fist.’‘Intercepting fist?’‘Or foot,’ adds Li. ‘Come on, touch me anywhere you can.’As his opponent steps forward to throw a punch, Lee snaps out a low side kick tohis kneecap.‘You see,’ explains Li, ‘to reach me, you must move to me. Your attack offers mean opportunity to intercept you. In this case I’m using my longest weapon, myside kick, against the nearest target, your kneecap. It can be compared to yourleft jab in boxing, except it’s much more damaging.’‘I see,’ says the friend nonchalantly. ‘Well, speaking of a left jab—’But Li blocks the sudden punch, having already been told the intention beforethe punch was even thrown. ‘You see, from your thought to your fist, how muchtime was lost.’Bruce used to explain to his students that a lot of martial arts are taught inthe block-hit, one-two manner when it’s more efficient to break the rhythm andperform a simultaneous block and hit. At an even more efficient level, awarenessis so attuned that as soon as the opponent moves he can be intercepted andstruck. At an even more refined level, even the intention of being attacked canbe felt and neutralized before it is begun.In the story, Bruce also teaches Longstreet to listen to what is going on aroundhim, not just to move for the sake of moving but to relate it to what is goingon. Li asks Longstreet if he can hear the bird that has been singing quietly inthe background throughout their conversation. Because Longstreet is blind, Licannot get him to become more aware of his peripheral sight, but he can get himto expand his overall awareness through listening more attentively. In writingLongstreet, Silliphant based the blind detective’s lessons with Li on his ownexperiences, explaining, ‘The first thing Bruce did with me was to concentrateon body movement and understanding the relationship between you and youropponent. At first, Bruce blindfolded me and made me move in conjunction withwhat I felt his movements might be, on all sides. We practised that for weeksbefore we began anything specific.’The same exercise was a natural for Li to teach the blind detective, just asBruce had got Silliphant and Joe Hyams to develop their kinesthetic awareness bypractising sticking hands while blindfolded.At one point Longstreet observes: ‘It’s funny that out of a martial art, out ofcombat, I feel something peaceful, something without hostility, almost asthough, if I knew jeet kune do, it would be enough to know it and not use it.’At a later training session, when Li tries to get his student to practise thefinger jab to the eyes, Longstreet finds himself unable to use what he’s beingtaught.‘Don’t worry, I’ve covered them,’ says Li, who’s wearing a pair of goggles.‘I can’t do it,’ says the detective.‘Why?’‘I don’t know, I just can’t do it!’‘Why? Because you’re blind? The finger jab is one of the most effective attacks. . .’‘Well, let’s just forget that attack shall we?’‘That man who attacked you,’ says Li, ‘would he have hesitated to gouge out youreyes?’‘Well, that’s his problem!’‘A bird would, or a cat would, without any hesitation, without thinking.’‘I’m not a bird, I’m not a cat,’ says Longstreet. ‘And I do think.’‘That’s your problem!’ says Li.Later Longstreet has problems trying to remember everything he’s been taught.‘If you try to remember, you will lose,’ says Li. ‘Empty your mind. Be likewater. Put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. Put water into a teapot, itbecomes the teapot. Water can flow; it can flow or creep or drip or crash. Bewater, my friend.’Longstreet asks why he doesn’t just stand in front of his opponent and recitewhat Li has just told him. ‘Maybe he’ll faint, or drown.’‘You are not ready,’ says Li.‘I know.’‘Like everyone else, you want to learn the way to win, but never to accept tolose. To accept defeat – to learn to die – is to be liberated from it. So whentomorrow comes, you must free your ambitious mind and learn the art of dying.May it be well with you tomorrow, Mike.’Paramount executives were pleased enough with the Longstreet episode to opentheir new fall season with it, and now, more than ever, despite all theobstacles he faced, Bruce Lee was convinced his future lay in America.At the same time, Hong Kong radio stations were phoning Bruce and broadcastinghis conversations over the air 8,000 miles away. One of the people listening wasRaymond Chow of Golden Harvest Studios, a former employee of Run Run Shaw, andhis bitter rival.For several years, Raymond Chow had been one of the top executives at ShawBrothers. With Run Run Shaw’s patronage, a young nightclub singer, Mona Fong,found a position in the company and soon manoeuvred herself into a senior role,eventually ending up as Chow’s superior. This provoked Chow to leave the companyand raise enough capital to set up on his own, but Chow and his partner LeonardHo were barely surviving and found it difficult to get their films shown due toShaw’s virtual monopoly of the distribution circuit. The Golden Harvest studioswere little more than a cluster of old shacks perched on a Kowloon hillside, andso far Chow hadn’t been in a position to improve his lot or strike back at Shaw.In Bruce Lee, however, he saw an opportunity to change that.Chow sent one of his senior producers, Liu Liang Hua, to make Bruce an offer.Liu was also Mrs Lo Wei, the wife of one of the directors Chow had lured awayfrom Shaw Brothers. Chow improved Shaw’s offer just enough to make Bruce bite.It was a simple deal: two pictures for a straight fee of $15,000, and Chow alsoincluded a generous one-way ticket to the location as part of the deal. Coburnand Silliphant advised Bruce against accepting the offer, saying that he shouldhold out for more, but Bruce was tired of waiting. After seeing previousopportunities slip away, he was determined not to lose this one and so signedthe deal.Bruce did his homework and viewed Golden Harvest’s current batch of releases,then called Raymond Chow and asked him if that was the best he could do. Thiswas one of Bruce’s favourite tactics: putting a person of some authority on theback foot, and it meant that Chow had to explain and justify himself to Brucerather than the other way round. In the end, though, the two found enough commonground for a workable relationship.Once Run Run Shaw heard about Bruce’s decision to work for Golden Harvest hecountered with an improved offer, but Bruce had already signed and intended tohonour the contract. Even so, a worried Chow tried to insist that Bruce flydirectly to the Thai film location rather than risk temptation by going via HongKong.Bruce asserted his autonomy by breaking his journey with an overnight stop inLondon – the only time he ever set foot on British soil. Feeling upbeat, andperhaps compensating for the inferior room he’d had in Bombay, he booked himselfinto a room at the Dorchester Hotel on Park Lane, though he decided not to eatthere, electing instead to stroll down Piccadilly and into Chinatown to eat inone of the restaurants in Gerrard Street.On arrival in Bangkok, Bruce was driven north to a film set in the remotevillage of Pak Chong. In the middle of the hot season, the small hotel was ahell-hole with no air-conditioning to alleviate the soaring heat and humidity.Even the water was polluted and there was no fresh food or mail service to speakof. Pak Chong was a place that only insect lovers might enthuse about, yet Brucedidn’t complain. He was there to make a film called The Big Boss, and that wasgood enough for him."},{"pageContent":" 18THE BIG BOSSThe Big Boss’s budget was less than $100,000 which, at the time, wouldn’t havepaid for a sixty-second TV commercial in the US. Initially the star of the filmwas intended to be James Tien, then a major star in Hong Kong, but Bruce Lee’sstrong performance soon relegated Tien to second billing.The simple plot of The Big Boss concerns the struggle of the Chinese communityin Bangkok, who live in fear of Thai gangsters run by a Japanese boss. Bruce Leeplays Cheng Chao An, who has left behind a troubled life in China to startafresh in Thailand. In turning over a new leaf, Cheng has vowed to his motherthat he will not get into any more fights and wears her locket to remind him ofhis promise. He is met in Thailand by his cousin, played by James Tien, and getsa job in the local ice factory, where his other cousins work. The factory turnsout to be a cover for a drug smuggling operation, and workers who discover thetruth, including two of Cheng’s cousins, are murdered. Discovering Cheng’sfighting skills, the ‘big boss’ of the title attempts to lure him into his webwith a promotion and prostitutes, but eventually a showdown ensues between Chengand the boss.In the first week of filming, Bruce found it harder and harder to keep hisfrustration in check. The equipment used for filming was old and in bad repairand the ‘script’ consisted of a few basic ideas scribbled on scraps of paper.The director, Wu Chai Wsaing, had a violent temper and screamed and ranted atthe entire cast and crew until the production manager – the same Mrs Lo Wei whohad signed Bruce to the Golden Harvest contract – could take no more. Mrs Lo Weicalled Raymond Chow and demanded the director be replaced, and by a happycoincidence, one of Chow’s other directors, a certain Mr Lo Wei, had justfinished a film in Taiwan and was duly dispatched to Thailand.The new director proved to be no better than the first. A compulsive gambler, LoWei was far more concerned with what was going on at the racetrack than what washappening on the film set. Because sound wasn’t recorded at the same time as theaction was filmed, Lo Wei arranged to have horse race commentary booming acrossthe set while the actors attempted to play a scene. Unsurprisingly, Bruce becameincensed by Lo Wei’s lack of commitment to the picture.After Bruce twisted his ankle landing awkwardly from a jump, he was only able todrag his injured leg, so in several scenes he had to be filmed in close-up. Arecent cut in his hand had still not healed and he needed rest and injectionsfor back pain after every scene. In addition to this discomfort, he was rackedwith aches and fever and had difficulty keeping food down. Lo Wei responded bycalling Bruce a hypochondriac and filming continued.During filming, Bruce kept trying to improve the poor script. Although Han YinChieh, the actor who plays the boss, was the official fight coordinator of thefilm, Bruce also took control of his own fight scenes, and whenever there was adispute, he would disrupt the situation by some little strategy, such as‘losing’ one of his contact lenses while filming in an ice-cutting factory wherethere were thousands of tiny ice chips on the floor.Other scenes were filmed in a local brothel which was both dirty and smelly.With the exception of Thai actress Malalene, who plays Wu Mang, the prostitutesin the film were real prostitutes who were used to being paid less than a dollara trick.While Bruce was isolated deep in Thailand, Longstreet opened the autumn TVseason in the US to good reviews. At last, Bruce Lee and Stirling Silliphant hadrealized a small part of what they had been hoping to achieve together for manyyears.Bruce’s episode generated more fan mail than the rest of the entire series,proving that Stirling Silliphant was right when he claimed it was Bruce’s firstgood film and one of the best martial arts shows ever seen on TV. Tom Tannenbaumimmediately tried to track down Bruce to get him to agree to appear in furtherepisodes of Longstreet, but no one could get a message to him as he was filminghours away from the nearest city. In the end, the situation worked to Bruce’sadvantage, since the telegrams meant that Golden Harvest executives weren’t slowto notice that US producers were chasing their new actor.On his return to Hong Kong, as he ploughed through the pile of telegrams waitingfor him, Bruce found offers to appear in three further episodes of Longstreetfor $1,000 a show. Knowing that a second picture for Golden Harvest was alreadyin the bag, Bruce asked Paramount to double their offer and they agreed. Lindacould now quit her job, but they were still not out of trouble over the houserepayments.When Bruce returned to Los Angeles, it turned out that the three Longstreetepisodes in question had long been written and, in view of Bruce’s surprisesuccess in the first episode, Paramount had quickly tried to work him intofurther stories. Bruce found himself making brief, hastily written appearancesthat were little more than walk-on parts, but despite this, there was a feelingthat his luck was about to ‘turn’. Paramount made a new option offer for an asyet unspecified television project and, having more or less excluded him fromtheir earlier plans, Warners briefly reconsidered taking the risk of making himthe lead role in The Warrior TV series.More than once Bruce mulled over everything that was happening. What was thebest course for him to take at such a critical point? How were audiences goingto react to The Big Boss? Should he keep his options open? There were morequestions than these to be considered, yet Bruce felt increasingly certain aboutone thing: his time had come.Although Bruce was met only by a local Boy Scout band when he returned to HongKong, there was a big enough crowd of journalists to indicate that even beforeThe Big Boss had opened, his star was rising. On 3 October 1971, together withRaymond Chow and his partner Leonard Ho, Bruce and Linda sat and waited for themidnight premiere of the film. They joked a little, trying to ease theapprehension they all felt. Hong Kong audiences would openly jeer at a film theydidn’t like and were even known to attack their seats with knives if it wasreally poor. When the film ended, a stunned silence lasting a few seconds wasfollowed by an outburst of euphoria and complete uproar. Bruce was mobbed as hetried to leave the theatre and the next day’s press was equally ecstatic.It’s obvious from the opening credits that The Big Boss was made on a shoestringbudget, since the credits are drawn by a rather shaky hand and there are enoughwobbly camera shots to suggest that most of it was shot without any retakes. Inaddition to this, canned cocktail-jazz muzak adds a bizarre note to the deathscenes, but The Big Boss is still better acted and plotted than any comparablefilm of the time and a half-credible story line strings the action sequencestogether.To Western eyes The Big Boss may have seemed like one more in a long line ofcheap exploitation films streaming out of Asia, but in the context of the HongKong film industry whose staple fare was windmilling fist fights and buckets ofblood, the film was a breakthrough. Bruce used his American experience to givehis and the other characters some human touches, and what to the West mightappear overstated, clumsy or even camp was the closest anyone had come torealism in the Asian film world. More importantly, the Mandarin audiences had agenuine star. Bruce Lee wasn’t a jobbing actor who’d been put through his pacesat Shaw’s drama academy, he had natural charisma. The fight scenes alone wouldhave been enough to make him a star in the East, and to prove they weren’tmerely the result of camera trickery or slick editing, Bruce insisted on longtakes in which the camera runs for up to half a minute on a single shot. Thoughthe exaggerated feats of the old-style Mandarin films are not absent, Brucemanaged to include the kind of action that had never been seen on film before.From the audience reaction at the premiere, Bruce knew the film would do well,but he hadn’t anticipated a runaway hit, and neither, of course, had Run RunShaw, who was left to bemoan his fate. ‘Bruce Lee was just another actor,’ hesighed heavily. ‘How could I know?’Within three weeks of its release, The Big Boss smashed all box office records,earning over $HK3 million. The film then played 875 performances in Hong Kongbefore going on to break records throughout the Mandarin circuit.While Bruce prepared to make his second film, Golden Harvest provided a smallfurnished apartment at 2 Man Wan Road, in the Waterloo Hill area of Kowloon. Theelevators in the building rarely worked, but rather than have everyone trudge upand down the stairs, Bruce turned it into a game in which they ran up thethirteen flights. Wu Ngan, Bruce’s ‘adopted’ brother, lodged with the family andsoon became Bruce’s steward, then later, when Wu Ngan married, his wife joinedthem too. Two-year-old Shannon started attending a local nursery school, whilesix-year-old Brandon went to La Salle, the school from which Bruce had beenexpelled some years earlier."},{"pageContent":" 19FIST OF FURYIn 1971, before the premiere of The Big Boss, Bruce Lee had already started workon his second film, Fist of Fury. The film was a hymn of revenge that played onthe deep animosities between the Chinese and Japanese, which are similar tothose between the Greeks and the Turks, or the Catholics and Protestants inIreland. As with The Big Boss, this second picture went into production with thestory little more than an outline of how the action might develop. Even so, Fistof Fury was completed in six weeks, again with a budget of $100,000, and withmany of the same faces that were seen in The Big Boss.The story begins with a real historical event, the death of a Chinese martialarts teacher Ho Yuan Chia in Shanghai in 1908, where the Japanese hadestablished a strong political presence. Ho was a stevedore of extraordinarystrength and ability who once routed an entire troop of Japanese challengers.Bruce Lee plays Chen Zhen, a former student of the old master, who arrives backat his old school to pay his respects to his teacher, only to find that he hasjust died. At the funeral a distraught Chen flings himself into the grave andtries to claw open the coffin, wailing, ‘How can a healthy man die?’The master’s memory is insulted when Wu, a reptilian Chinese who works as atranslator for the Japanese martial arts association, presents the students witha tablet inscribed: ‘To the Sick Nation of Eastern Asia’. He tries to goad Cheninto retaliating with one of the worst unintentional dubbing puns ever heard ina film: ‘What’s the matter? Are you yellow or something?’ Chen is so enragedthat despite his teacher’s code, he goes to the Japanese club andsingle-handedly wipes out the entire membership, smashing the insulting tablet.The Japanese association’s president demands Chen’s arrest, so Chen goes intohiding. Lo Wei, who was also directing this film, played the role of thedetective on Chen’s trail.Chen discovers that two Japanese infiltrators played a part in poisoning histeacher, but what’s not immediately obvious to Western audiences is how Chenachieves this: by noticing the difference between Chinese and Japanese-styleunderwear. Chen kills them and hangs their bodies from a lamppost outside thehouse of the Japanese consul, but in retaliation, the Japanese wreck the Chineseschool, showing no mercy to the women students and desecrating the shrine to themaster’s memory.Meanwhile, the Japanese school holds a welcoming party for a Russian wrestlerwho has left his country. Leering at belly dancers and guzzling sake, theJapanese insult their Chinese collaborator, Wu, who crawls away drunk. Outside,he staggers to a rickshaw, which happens to be driven by Chen, who’s now in oneof his many disguises. Chen picks up the whole rickshaw and holds it and itspassenger several feet in the air to make him confess that it was Suzuki, thehead of the Japanese school, who ordered the murder of his teacher – stunts andimpossible feats like this were all included at Lo Wei’s insistence. As Chenkills Wu, more badly translated dialogue has Wu whining, ‘Why is everyone alwayspicking on me?’ before he too is hung from a lamppost.Disguised as a Japanese telephone repairman, Chen gains entry to the Japaneseschool – Bruce posing as a Japanese was something that sent the Chinese fanswild with delight. Once inside the school, Chen fights his way past a swordsmanand the Russian wrestler to the inner sanctum, where he avenges his teacher bykilling Suzuki in combat. Chen returns to his own school and sees that amassacre has taken place, but when the police arrive, threatening to close theschool down under pressure from the Japanese authorities, Chen emerges from hishiding place and surrenders to the Shanghai police, with the assurance that hisfellow students will be spared and his school’s honour will remain intact. Atthe school gates, a row of armed police level their rifles at him. Bare-chestedand defiant, Chen runs headlong at them, launching himself in a glorious deathleap into a hail of bullets – an image lifted straight from the final scene ofButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.From the start of filming the already strained relationship between Bruce Leeand Lo Wei went from bad to worse. Bruce was furious with Lo Wei’s continuinglack of attention – patient forbearance wasn’t Bruce’s strongest quality andthere were several clashes as the film progressed. In Thailand this hadn’t beentoo damaging, but now that Bruce was a local hero and filming was taking placein the heart of Hong Kong, the press was quick to make the feud publicknowledge. Lo Wei had started in the film industry as an actor in 1948, beforebecoming a director in 1957. He had made over eighty low-budget feature films,mostly for Shaw Brothers before Raymond Chow brought him to Golden Harvest, andhe was not about to be told his business by a young upstart who was only makinghis second film. It wasn’t long before the two couldn’t agree on anything.Much of the film’s budget was spent creating the two Japanese buildings andgardens, complete with bridges and pools. One week was spent on location at anearby park, and there Lo Wei had to contend with local street gangs, whoseleaders demanded payment for using ‘their bit’ of road. This ‘protection money’was usually paid, much to the annoyance of Bruce, who had to be restrained fromseeing off the hustlers.The production values of Fist of Fury were higher than those of The Big Boss.Spaghetti Western-style soundtrack music was added, but far more evocative werethe noises made by Bruce – strangely beautiful cries that sound like a wild cator screeching bird and which only enhanced his animal grace. In the Englishlanguage version, some of the effect is lost to the inappropriate voice used todub the speaking parts, but at least the animal cries are Bruce’s. In additionto the power of his fighting action and cries, some of Bruce’s facialexpressions have an almost elemental power to them. At times his face registersan extraordinary blend of emotions – shock at taking a life, the ecstasy ofrevenge, regret that it has to be this way – as well as the strange gaze thatenters his eyes as he kills an opponent in scenes where the fist of the titleappears almost to have a will of its own. Yet all of this was overshadowed byhis introduction of the weapon that will forever be associated with him: thenunchakas. Although the nunchakas had made a brief appearance in The GreenHornet series, Fist of Fury marks their first real use.The nunchakas are two short hardwood sticks connected by a flexible chain orcord. When one of the clubs is grasped, the other can be swung to strike with upto 1,600 pounds of force at the point of impact. The shock of this impact is nottransferred to the club held in the striker’s hand which is isolated by theshort connecting cord.The ‘chucks’ that Bruce Lee uses on screen are lighter than the heavy woodenweapons normally used for combat, and these lighter versions could be spun andswitched even faster, adding to the excitement. When the swooping noises ofrushing air were overdubbed later, the scenes became even more impressive.Although Bruce was still not the film’s official fight coordinator, hisinfluence is overwhelming, and nowhere more than in the nunchaka scenes,although these were edited out in many countries and the weapon itself wasbanned in many states, including Bruce’s home state of California.The nunchakas didn’t start life as a weapon but as a tool, used by farmers onthe island of Okinawa for flailing rice to separate the grain from the husk.When the Japanese invaded Okinawa they confiscated all the weapons on theisland. The islanders, a melting-pot community at the heart of several tradingroutes, had over the centuries merged fighting skills from China with those ofother Asian cultures, and resourcefully they developed a system of fighting byemploying their farming tools as weapons. Also on the island were many Chinesefamilies, including several Shaolin monks who had set up home there, and theOkinawan rebels persuaded these monks to teach them the secrets of Chinesehand-to-hand combat.Eventually the Japanese discovered this method and absorbed the fightingtechniques into their own culture, and this new style was called karate, aliteral translation of ‘Chinese hand’. The fact that karate, barely forty yearsold, was far better known in America than kung fu, which was many centuries old,was due to karate being brought back by US servicemen after the war. The factthat karate originated with Shaolin monks, who had taught their skills to theOkinawans in order to help them repel the Japanese invaders, was not wasted onBruce Lee.The opening scenes of Fist of Fury dug deep into Chinese popular feelings. TheChinese had been plundered and exploited for centuries by stronger foreignpowers. For hundreds of years the relationship between the Chinese and Japanesewas one of open hostility, punctuated by regular periods of war. Japan wasresponsible for the territorial division of China at the turn of the century andwent on to humiliate China, Hong Kong and the rest of the Far East during theSecond World War. It was during this war – only thirty years before the film wasmade – that the Japanese performed atrocious medical ‘experiments’ such ascutting their living Chinese prisoners in half.Feelings of resentment for tourists were often hidden behind smiling faces, butreal hatred was reserved for the Japanese. Despite his years in the UnitedStates, Bruce was well aware of national feelings and played on them freely,taking great satisfaction from portraying a lone kung fu artist wiping out anentire school of karate practitioners. When Bruce Lee cast his gaze over hisJapanese opponents and declared, ‘Now you listen to me, and I’ll only say itonce: we are not sick men,’ audiences went wild, leaping to their feet or on tothe seats to howl their approval and delight.A similar standing ovation occurred when Chen shattered the ‘No Dogs and ChineseAllowed’ sign at the entrance to the park; elderly members of the audience whohad actually lived in Shanghai during that oppressive era openly cried andembraced each other in joy. Strictly speaking, the existence of the infamoussign is probably a myth, although rules to that effect were certainly in placeand would have been evident to park visitors.En route to the film’s climax, Bruce dispatches the samurai who killed hismaster and finishes off the Russian fighter. By the end of the film, Bruce hadadvanced from being a screen fighter who was as good as he appeared to muchmore. He had done something dreamed of by every politician: he was a householdname and a national hero.In the weeks following the release of Fist of Fury, the atmosphere on thestreets of Hong Kong was akin to that in England after the English football teambeat Germany in the 1966 World Cup Final. It wasn’t simply a matter of winning agame of football, just as what was happening on the streets of Hong Kong in 1971was more than simply popular reaction to an exciting new movie. It was a matterof national pride and triumph over a bitter rival. In that sense, Fist of Furywas no different from the great rash of war films that came out in the 1950s, inwhich the Germans and Japanese are always villainous caricatures. Bruce Lee hadstruck a nerve that ran right into the heart of his countrymen, and through hisfilms he replaced a sense of self doubt and inferiority with one of dignity,identity and victory. To their astonishment, the new hero of the Hong KongChinese was Chinese!In its first four-week run Fist of Fury broke the records set by The Big Bossand took over $HK4 million at the box office. Outside the theatres, ticketschanged hands for up to $50. In Singapore, the film had to be withdrawn for aweek while traffic police found a way of dealing with the numbers of peopleclamouring to see the film. In the Philippines, the government withdrew the filmin order to give some of their own movies a chance to earn some money.Though hardly a soul in the West was aware of it, Bruce Lee had become thefastest rising star in the world and the film industry’s hottest property.Suddenly he was unable to walk down a street or eat in a restaurant withoutdrawing a crowd. While young men everywhere in Southeast Asia wanted to be BruceLee, it seemed that every young girl wanted to marry him. And it wasn’t onlyyoung people who were aware of him. A middle-aged Englishman in a neat businesssuit who was interviewed as he left a theatre showing the film said, ‘He’s in aleague of his own. It’s a question of body movement and choreography; thetiming, the overcoming of human limitations.’But there were troublesome aspects to Bruce’s instant celebrity, including arapid increase in the number of challenges to fight he received from everystreet punk wanting a moment of glory. Photos of Bruce appeared daily in theChinese newspapers, alongside articles linking him to every local starlet, orrevealing the latest twists in his running battle with Lo Wei.The director had taken to calling himself Hong Kong’s first ‘millionairedirector’, while claiming all credit for the success of Bruce’s films. But LoWei destroyed any credibility he might have had by claiming to have taught Bruceto fight on the set of The Big Boss, saying that while Bruce was a good streetfighter he’d found it necessary to teach him how to fight on film.The truth of the matter was that Bruce Lee had not only propelled Lo Wei to histen minutes of glory, he’d single-handedly saved Golden Harvest and Raymond Chowfrom obscurity. Now that Bruce had fulfilled his two-picture contract for Chow,he was free to negotiate a new one, and producers across Southeast Asia weredesperate to secure his name on a contract. People would stop Bruce in thestreet and hand him cheques for large sums, which he immediately tore up,knowing that if he cashed any of them he would have found himself committed toone project or another. Some producers were offering a reward of $10,000 toanyone who could get Bruce’s signature on a contract. Run Run Shaw, who only ayear previously had thought that $10,000 was too much to pay Bruce, now proposedthe biggest pay rise in history by offering him twenty times that sum. WhenBruce refused, a blank cheque followed.More than one of Bruce’s distant relatives was suddenly inspired to seek outtheir long-lost cousin, but all this served only to make Bruce wary. He nolonger knew who to trust or who was trying to take advantage of him.One thing was certain: Bruce Lee would no longer work like a hired hand forwages. He went to see Raymond Chow and suggested they become partners. Chow,realizing that Run Run Shaw was waiting for Bruce just down the road, rightlyfigured that half the profits from an association with Bruce was a lot betterthan none. The two men formed Concord Productions, with Bruce supposedly makingthe creative decisions while Chow was in charge of day-to-day business matters.Unfortunately, Chow’s first move was to ask Lo Wei to direct a new film withBruce called Yellow-Faced Tiger, which was set to start filming in Japan inJanuary 1972. Once again there was no script for the film and Bruce refused tocommit to the film until there was one. Although they went through the charadeof several abortive planning sessions, in truth, Bruce had no intention ofletting Lo Wei anywhere near another of his pictures and had already said asmuch in public. Bruce declared that he wanted to write his own scripts anddirect his own films, and he wanted a share of the profits too, because it washis appearance in the films that drew the crowds. No Hong Kong film actor hadever done this before, but Bruce had no respect for hack directors and believedhis enthusiasm would result in a far better film than anything from Lo Wei’sconveyor belt.As Bruce began work on a film called Way of the Dragon, ripples spreadthroughout the Hong Kong film industry. Before Bruce decided to write anddirect, actors had just taken their wages and done what they were told. And nomatter how well a film did, only the producers saw any profit; everyone elsetook a salary, usually not a very good one. Now that Bruce had opened the door,other leading actors pressed for better pay and conditions, and the effectfiltered all the way down the line as far as technicians and film crews. Notonly did Bruce think it was fairer that key people got a share of the profits,he reasoned that it would increase everyone’s enthusiasm and involvement in aproject, which would in turn raise the standards of the films being made. ThatBruce Lee’s films captured international attention and resulted in Hong Kongfilms being more competently made was in no small part due to his revitalizingeffect on an industry whose methods had become tired and routine. One Hong Kongnewspaper commented, ‘Bruce Li [sic] is clearly an asset amid a local filmindustry bankrupt in everything but quantity.’It was during this period that Bruce gave interviews and wrote articles for theFar Eastern press. Taken together, they reveal both his ambitions and hisdilemmas. Bruce found himself answering charges of glorifying violence forscenes like the one in The Big Boss where he splits a man’s head in half with asaw. Bruce claimed that the way he portrayed it was simply action bordering onfantasy. The real violence, he said, was the slaughter happening in Vietnam. ForBruce, the problem was that all his audiences wanted from him was action; theysaw him as a superhero. Bruce complained to the Hong Kong Standard that if hereally expressed what he wanted to in his films, his audiences wouldn’tunderstand him most of the time. His real ambition, he said, was to make filmsthat were serious, philosophical and entertaining, and to take someresponsibility for educating his audience.Bruce saw the root problems of the Hong Kong film industry as its lack ofquality, commitment and basic professionalism. He thought Mandarin films wereoverplayed with poor scripts, and he told New Nation – an English-languagenewspaper in Singapore – that he was often the only one who turned up to work ontime, with other crew members drifing in up to an hour later. He declared he wasas willing to invest as much energy in film-making as he had in martial arts,and he viewed his twelve years in the US as a period of preparation and growth.To those who said he was simply lucky, he replied that it was odd, but theharder he worked the luckier he was.As Bruce basked in the attention, continuing to clarify his intentions and sharehis ambitions with the press, who now called him The King of Hong Kong, he wasforced early in 1972 to sell the Bel Air home that had drained his money fasterthan it could be earned. It was sold at a small profit, still in need of somerepair."},{"pageContent":" 20WAY OF THE DRAGONBruce Lee had made two successful films in the East, but his ambitions still layin the West. Even as he planned his third film, he anxiously awaited a decisionfrom Warners and the ABC network about The Warrior. He wanted the partdesperately and had set his mind on it so much that he told both his friends andthe local press that matters were virtually settled. However, towards the end of1971, an interview he did for Canadian TV indicated that things weren’t goinghis way at all. The Canadian news reporter Pierre Berton, who was one of thefirst in the West to realize the new phenomenon that was Bruce Lee, flew to HongKong to interview Bruce.Berton: Are you going to stay in Hong Kong and be famous, or are you going tothe United States to be famous?Bruce: I’m gonna do both. Because I have already made up my mind that in theUnited States, I think something of the Oriental, I mean the true Oriental,should be shown.Berton: Hollywood sure as heck hasn’t.Bruce: You better believe it man. I mean it’s always the pigtail and thebouncing around, chop-chop, you know, with the eyes slanted and all that.Berton: Let me ask you about the problems that you face as a Chinese hero in anAmerican series. Have people come up to you in the industry and said, ‘Well, wedon’t know how the audience is going to take a non-American’?Bruce: Well, the question has been raised. In fact, it is being discussed, andthat is why The Warrior is probably not going to be on . . . They think,businesswise, it’s a risk. And I don’t blame them . . . If I were the man withthe money I would probably have my own worry whether or not the acceptance wouldbe there.Berton: How about the other side of the coin: is it possible that you are –well, you’re fairly hip and fairly Americanized – are you too Western forOriental audiences?Bruce: I have been criticized for that.On 7 December 1971, Bruce received a telegram from Warners saying that ‘due topressures from the network regarding casting’ he had been dropped from TheWarrior TV series, which had by now been renamed Kung Fu.In his 1993 book The Kung Fu Book of Caine: The Complete Guide to TV’s FirstMystical Eastern Western, Herbie Pilato writes about the casting history for theseries:Before the filming of the Kung Fu TV movie began, there was some discussion asto whether or not an Asian actor should play Kwai Chang Caine. Bruce Lee’s namewas put forward for the role. But in 1971, Bruce Lee wasn’t the cult film herohe later became for his roles in Fists of Fury and Enter the Dragon. At thatpoint he was best known as Kato on TV’s Green Hornet.‘In my eyes and in the eyes of Jerry Thorpe [director],’ said Harvey Frand[production supervisor], ‘David Carradine was always our first choice to playCaine. But there was some disagreement because the network was interested in amore muscular actor and the studio was interested in getting Bruce Lee.’ Frandsays Lee wouldn’t have really been appropriate for the series, despite the factthat he went on to considerable success in the martial arts film world. The KungFu show needed a serene person, and Carradine was more appropriate for the role.Ed Spielman [scriptwriter] agrees: ‘I liked David in the part. One of Japan’sforemost karate champions used to say that the only qualification that wasneeded to be trained in the martial arts was that you had to know how to dance.And on top of being an accomplished athlete and actor, David could dance . . .The character was half-Asian and half-Caucasian, so either an Asian or aCaucasian would have been a reasonable choice; a Eurasian would have been themost natural choice.Many of these later comments by those involved have more than a hint ofretrospective justification. For the record, Bruce Lee’s mother was half-Germanand he was the 1957 Cha-Cha Champion of Hong Kong, making him in fact a Eurasiandancer – although hardly a ‘serene’ one! But as one senior TV executive atWarners later admitted, although they knew he wanted the role, Bruce Lee wasnever seriously considered.Before taking the role of Caine, David Carradine openly admitted he had onlyheard the expression ‘kung fu’ twice and had certainly never practised the art.Yet he confidently asserted that ‘No one on the planet was more prepared on asmany levels to play the role of Caine as I was.’ In fact, most of the earlyaction from the series features judo moves allied to Jewish Torah philosophy,because the technical advisor, David Chow, also knew little about kung fu, andits writers knew little about Taoism. Eventually a new technical director, KamYuen, was brought in.On 22 February 1972, ABC TV’s Movie of the Week was the pilot for the Kung Fuseries. The accompanying press release explained the theme: ‘Kwai Chang Caine, aChinese-American fugitive from a murder charge in Imperial China, becomes asuperhero to the coolies building the transcontinental railroad through hismastery of an ancient science-religion.’On 8 August 1972, due to public demand the Kung Fu pilot was repeated followingthousands of letters flooding into the production office. It became a weeklyseries in January 1973 and quickly became the number-one TV show in the US.Joe Lewis, the karate champion who trained with Bruce Lee, recalls Bruce’s ownidea for the opening of what became the Kung Fu series: a Chinese-lookingstagecoach with lots of ornamentation pulls into a dusty main street. As all thelocal cowboys amble up to look it over, the doors fly open, and out jumps a manin a kung fu suit. Lewis says that when Warners gave the part to DavidCarradine, Bruce decided he would concentrate on Hong Kong to begin his climb tosuccess, just as Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson had gone to Europe to becomestars first. Lewis adds, ‘It hurt Bruce when he failed to get the Kung Fuseries. He experienced a lot of rejection.’Bruce Lee had been thinking about writing and directing long before he went toHong Kong to make his first film for Golden Harvest. Joe Lewis says that duringthe time he and Chuck Norris were training with Bruce, he would often mentionideas for films. Although Joe and Bruce worked together when Bruce choreographedthe fights for The Wrecking Crew, Lewis declined to get involved in Bruce’s newventure. He felt that in this film, Bruce was aiming to show that the Asianmartial artist was superior to the Caucasian.Lewis claims that Bruce wanted to cast him as ‘a big, strong, muscular,blue-eyed, blond-haired, all-American punch bag’. But Bruce countered that theproblem was finding Western martial artists – who almost always had a biggerphysique – who were fast enough to fight him convincingly. Bruce said that heasked Chuck Norris to appear in Way of the Dragon because Norris was one of thefew Western martial artists who was fast enough. Bruce commented that he’dworked on his own speed because a smaller man who can swing faster hits as hardas a heavier man who swings slowly. ‘And besides,’ he added, ‘you can’t keepfighting midgets.’Joe Lewis obviously felt that the power of the stronger, heavier Western martialartist would ultimately prevail over the speed of the faster, lighter Asianmartial artist and that’s why he declined to act to the contrary. Lewiscontinues, ‘Bruce knew that he was asking me to get involved in a movie where Igot my butt beat by a little 128-pound Chinese guy who’d never been in thering.’A succinct comment from Bruce’s mother shows that Joe wasn’t far off the mark.Grace Lee recalls, ‘Bruce told me: “Mom, I’m an Oriental person, therefore Ihave to defeat all the whites in the film.” I don’t believe he ever mentionedthis to Chuck Norris.’However, Bruce had mentioned this to Chuck Norris, who recalls:In 1972, Bruce was directing Way of the Dragon and wanted me to be in it. ‘Iwant you to be my opponent,’ Bruce said with excitement. ‘We’ll have a fight inthe Coliseum in Rome – two gladiators in a fight to the death. Best of all, wecan choreograph it ourselves. I promise you the fight will be the highlight ofthe film.’‘Great,’ I said, ‘who wins?’‘I do,’ Bruce said with a laugh, ‘I’m the star!’‘Oh? You’re going to beat up the current world karate champion?’‘No,’ said Bruce, ‘I’m going to kill the current world karate champion!’ Ilaughed and agreed to do the movie after gaining twenty pounds, at his request,because he wanted me to look more formidable as his opponent.In early 1972, in preparation for filming Way of the Dragon, Bruce Lee boughtand read a dozen books dealing with all aspects of filmmaking. Placingincredible demands on his energy, he intended virtually to make the entirepicture himself: to write, produce, direct and star in it; to scout thelocations, cast it, choose the wardrobe and choreograph the fight scenes. In theprocess he lost several pounds of hard-won weight.For the storyline, Bruce drew on his memories of leaving Hong Kong for SanFrancisco in 1958, and on his experiences as a waiter at Ruby Chow’s restaurant.When he’d first arrived in the US, Bruce had bought a Chinese-Englishdictionary; but he now found himself referring to it to find the appropriateChinese words, rather than English ones, so that he could express his ideas whenplanning meetings with his assistants.Way of the Dragon was the first Hong Kong-based picture to be shot in Europe. At$130,000, the budget was slightly higher than his previous films, but productioncosts were already covered by pre-sales to Taiwan. On 4 May 1972, the first teamarrived in Rome. It consisted of Bruce, Raymond Chow and Nishimoto Tadashi, aJapanese cameraman Bruce hired because he considered the Japanese to have moretechnical expertise. Leading actress Nora Miao, along with other members of castand crew, arrived three days later, after spending nineteen hours on a planerouted via Thailand, India and Israel.Bruce let the crew rest for a couple of days, but when shooting started on 10May, he proved to be a demanding director who expected the same level ofcommitment from everyone else as he was prepared to invest himself. In thefollowing days they buzzed around Rome, pausing to film illegally at theColosseum. At the Trevi fountain, they stayed long enough for Bruce to throw acoin in the water and make a wish. It’s not hard to imagine what it was.Having shot the location set-ups, Bruce could now turn his attention to moreimportant matters: the fight scenes. Knowing how it would look on camera, Brucespent a lot of time teaching his co-actors how to react convincingly. Incontrast to the speed at which he’d hounded everyone around Rome, shooting oversixty scenes in one day alone, he then spent over forty-five hours on his fightscene with Chuck Norris. Bruce’s choreographed directions for this scene took upnearly a quarter of the script. As with all the fight scenes, Bruce watched thedaily rushes, and if he saw any unconvincing moment of action, the whole scenewould have to be re-shot. By the time the film wrapped, Bruce had been involvedin yet another aspect of filmmaking: he played percussion on the music for thesoundtrack.In the film Bruce plays a country bumpkin named Tang Lung (China Dragon) wholeaves Hong Kong and goes to Rome. While waiting to be met at the airport hegoes into a restaurant where, due to problems with the language, he finds he hasmistakenly ordered four plates of soup. Tang is later met by his cousin, playedby Nora Miao, and as they drive to her apartment, she explains that she hasinherited a restaurant on some property wanted by the mob. In the scene itselfthe story is more concerned with Tang’s need to find a toilet, something thathad them rolling in the aisles in Hong Kong.Way of the Dragon is played as a comedy, with pauses to accommodate audiencelaughter and a soundtrack punctuated with comic ‘wah-wah’ sounds and ‘boings’from the timpani. Yet, for all that, it features some outstanding fight scenesand one or two excellent kung fu lessons.All the waiters in the restaurant are learning karate in order to repel thethugs who are harassing them and driving away the restaurant’s customers. Tangattends a training session at the back of the premises, where one of the waiters– Bruce’s old friend Unicorn – is drilling the others – including Bruce’sadopted brother, Wu Ngan. An argument starts about the merits of the variousfighting systems. ‘It doesn’t matter where it comes from,’ says Tang, ‘you canlearn to use it.’ Later, when the thugs return to intimidate the customers, Tangdoes battle with them outside. The waiters are so impressed with what they seethat they vow to give up karate and learn Chinese fighting.A further confrontation between Bruce and the thugs is played for laughs, but itcontains some superb fight sequences, especially those featuring Bruce using thenunchakas. The weapon’s potential for being more dangerous to an inept user thanto his opponent is a comic possibility seized on by Bruce. One of the Italianhoods manages to grab a pair and having seen Tang wielding them with nonchalantgrace, he believes he too is imbued with the supernatural power of an Excalibur,but as he goes to strike Tang, he knocks himself out.No matter how skilled a martial artist is, however, he can’t beat a bullet,which is why kung fu movies were more credible in the East than in the US andEurope, because the martial arts tradition in places like Hong Kong andSingapore was intertwined with the British custom – at the time – of havingmainly unarmed police. Likewise, most of the population were similarly unarmed,because there was no access to guns and most people couldn’t afford them. Menfought with their bodies, hand-to-hand, or used traditional and makeshiftweapons.In Way of the Dragon Bruce had the gangsters carry guns and attempted toconfront the problem by having Tang carve poison darts, which he fires withunerring accuracy into the gangsters’ gun hands, just as Kato had done in thefirst episode of The Green Hornet. These sequences do no more to overcome themajor drawback of the martial arts genre than any other attempt and are the mostunlikely scenes of the film, though the action that follows more thancompensates.Once Tang has dispatched the local heavies, the Godfather has to import hiredfighters played by Wong In Sik, a Korean hapkido exponent, and karate stars BobWall and Chuck Norris. In the Western version of the film, Norris’s character isnamed Colt. By offering a truce, the gang lures Tang into a trap. The first twoopponents are dealt with, then in a sudden shift of scene from the countrysideto the centre of Rome, the final scene is fought out under the arches of theColosseum. Tang and his ultimate Anglo-Saxon enemy, Colt, face each other withall the dignity and formality of two samurai warriors; their only spectator atiny kitten. Again there are comic moments, such as when Tang rips a handful ofhair from Colt’s chest, but this fight scene is the best that Bruce Lee evercommitted to film. In it Bruce was anxious not to make the fight a completelyone-sided affair, but there was never any doubt as to what the outcome would be.In the first half of the screen fight, it is Colt who has the upper hand,knocking Tang to the floor a couple of times and bloodying his mouth. Theturning point comes when Tang bounces back, dancing and moving like MuhammadAli, bewildering Colt. As Tang speeds up the cadence of his footwork Coltfollows him, not realizing that Tang has regained the initiative and is nowdictating the pace.In one sequence Bruce Lee overwhelms Chuck Norris with a cluster of punches thatare almost too quick to count. It’s a sequence taken directly from MuhammadAli’s fight with Cleveland Williams, which Bruce studied over and over again onhis home movie projector. It’s even shot from exactly the same camera angles. Inthe ensuing action, Tang delivers a devastatingly fast combination of strikes ashe begins to overwhelm Colt, who sustains a broken arm and leg but struggles tohis feet to continue the fight. Tang glances down at Colt’s broken leg andshakes his head, as if to say, ‘Look, you’ve got nothing to prove. Stop thiswhile you can.’ But Colt’s warrior code leaves him only two options: victory ordeath. Colt almost smiles in acceptance of his fate, then attacks with one lastflurry of blows until in the final exchange Tang breaks Colt’s neck. At thismoment a strange expression of remorse spreads over Tang’s face, then he lowersColt’s body to the ground and respectfully places Colt’s jacket and black beltover his body.In beating Norris in the Western world’s greatest historical arena, Bruce Leewas once again giving his audience what they wanted to see, but he was alsoaware of the sentiments he was stirring and sought to include other lessons. Theway he honours the opponent he has just killed is also in accordance with one ofthe tenets of the warrior’s code: that a worthy opponent be treated withrespect.Bruce Lee told his friends that Way of the Dragon would be a hit on the Mandarincircuit but that he had no plans to release it in the West. The humour, whichhad Eastern audiences convulsed with laughter, would be missed in the West. The‘soup scene’ was a big hit in the East because Campbell’s had recently begunimporting their soups there and indigestion from this unfamiliar food wascommon. Bruce’s script was based on a real understanding of the Chinese psyche.Bruce’s character in the film has a much softer persona, with his hair brusheddown and pointed sideburns that gives him an almost elfin look, but he slowlystrips this character of his superficial naivety to reveal the capable hero atheart.To a chorus of disbelief from the Hong Kong press, Bruce predicted that thepicture would earn $HK5 million. Shaking their heads in amazement, journalistsalso showed some irritation. They were no longer interested in celebrating thesuccess of Bruce Lee, they were looking for flaws, so while dutifully reportingthe new milestone in Bruce’s career, the press began speculating about who hemight be sleeping with.In August 1972, Miss Pang Cheng Lian, a reporter on New Nation, the Englishnewspaper in Singapore, went to Hong Kong for a week to write four dailyfeatures based on interviews with Bruce Lee. She spent time with him at theGolden Harvest studios where he was dubbing Way of the Dragon and there they hadlunch together, after which Bruce made his customary call home. When hereturned, Miss Pang brought up the subject of female martial artists. Bruce toldher that a woman could never match a man for strength, so her best bet was touse her powers of seduction and persuasion to gain an opportunity to jab herassailant in the eyes or kick his groin before running like hell. With talk ofseduction and vital parts, the questions turned to Bruce’s relationship with acertain actress. His response was that the people of Hong Kong had too much timeto invent stories that would upset the girl in question, Betty Ting Pei.In 1967 Tang Mei Li changed her name to Betty Ting Pei and signed up as one ofRun Run Shaw’s jobbing actresses. The ‘sultry Taiwanese sex bomb’ – as herpublicity described her – had acted in around thirty films – dramas, comedies,musicals and martial arts films – though most often she played roles that endedup in the bedroom. The twenty-five-year-old rising starlet had yet to breakthrough into leading roles when she and Bruce were introduced on the film set byRaymond Chow, and within days, Bruce told his friends, ‘She brightens up anotherwise dull film set. She quite makes my day.’The Lee family now moved from the small apartment on Man Wan Road into one ofthe few two-storey detached houses in Hong Kong, at 41 Cumberland Road in theKowloon Tong area. Although the large eleven-room house might have beenconsidered average in Beverly Hills, in Hong Kong it was a palace. It hadwrought-iron gates and an eight-foot stone wall enclosing a large Japanesegarden where a stream wound through the trees to a goldfish pond spanned by anornamental bridge, all of which could be viewed from the balcony of the mainroom, where Bruce had set up his new hi-fi system. Best of all, the house hadenough space for a study to house his thousands of books and a fully equippedgymnasium.Bruce replaced the red Porsche he’d given up in Los Angeles with a new redMercedes 350 SL, most likely the same one seen in the closing shots of Way ofthe Dragon. And in response to Bruce’s taste for silk suits and even a fur coat,the press duly voted him ‘Worst-Dressed Actor of the Year’.The move to their new house happened just in time, and it became Bruce’ssanctuary and the only place he could enjoy some peace and privacy. A few yearsbefore he had put on impromptu displays of kung fu at dances, doing one-fingerpush-ups to attract an audience. Now he couldn’t visit a restaurant withouthaving to sit at a corner table with his back to everyone, hoping not to benoticed. But once the waiters began to hover, there would soon be a queue ofpeople demanding autographs and asking familiar questions, and by the time Bruceleft the restaurant, he would be faced with a jostling crowd of paparazzi.What’s more, if he reacted badly to any of this, the next day’s headlines wouldreport his arrogance and ill manners.Bruce’s fame was a double-edged sword, and he said he now understood why starslike Steve McQueen avoided public places and regretted that they could no longerlead a normal life. Yet, in recalling his earlier vow to be a bigger star thanMcQueen, Bruce couldn’t resist revelling in his celebrity.The pressure of sudden stardom may be an entertainment business cliché, but itis real enough. While it drives some to become recluses or surround themselveswith bodyguards, in Bruce’s case another contradiction emerged. On the one handhe fed off the public’s response and the recognition he’d been trying for yearsto achieve, on the other he could no longer pursue his art in the way that hadmade all this possible. The paradox revealed itself at a party once where aguest failed to recognize him. With a healthy dose of self-mockery he extendedhis hand and announced, ‘Bruce Lee, movie star.’The old money problems had eased, but new problems arose to take their place.Producers extended big offers, usually with maximum fanfare and minimumresources to back them up, simply as a way of increasing their own prestige andgetting some free publicity. The China Star, a down-market Hong Kong daily, rana series ‘written’ by Yip Chun, the son of Yip Man, who at one time had trainedalongside Bruce. The article quoted Yip Chun as saying that he had seen Bruceknocked down by an opponent during training. While no one could expect Bruce tohave been invincible from the age of thirteen, the tone of the article upset himenough for him to track down Yip Chun and ask if he’d really said what had beenprinted. Yip Chun denied it, claiming it was an extravagance on the part of thearticle’s ghostwriter, The Star’s boss, a hard-bitten Australian named GrahamJenkins, who duly reported that Bruce had threatened his paper’s contributor.Bruce began a legal action against the paper, only to find himself beingfollowed everywhere by photographers and reporters wanting to hype up asensation on the slightest pretext.What the media didn’t report were Bruce’s simple acts of consideration forothers. Bob Wall offers an example:Both Bruce and I wore contact lenses and when we were fighting in the dust, inthe Roman countryside, we kept getting choked up. Bruce had some really good eyelotion and we were able to get through our fight scenes by using it. Later, as Iwas about to board the plane back to the US, I saw a commotion outside theairport departure lounge where a crowd of people had gathered. Then I sawBruce’s red Mercedes and a few moments later he appeared in the lounge. He’ddriven out to the airport to give me a whole case of this eye lotion as a gift.Even with all the demands on his time, he’d taken the trouble to do that.Bruce Lee had never been motivated purely by matters of wealth or status.Bombarded with invitations both to present and accept various awards andtrophies, he elected instead to spend the time studying or training. Neitherfame nor money was an end in itself, they were simply the by-products of himdoing his work well. The biggest advantage of money was that it allowed him theautonomy to set his own standards. As a martial arts teacher, Bruce hadmaintained standards that prevented him from over-commercializing his art byopening a chain of ‘gung fu’ institutes that would have been connected to him inname only, and he sought to apply the same values to his films. It’s doubtfulwhether the producers who now hounded him would have understood the principlesby which he tried to operate; they just wanted to lure him to their sets withpromises of huge sums of money. Just as fame was a side-effect of being thebest, so wealth would be the natural outcome of work done with commitment andattention. For Bruce, what remained important was the quality of one’s work, soa good studio carpenter could earn his respect more easily than a hack directorlike Lo Wei.In the slipstream of three successful films Bruce Lee now planned a new film,which would feature some of the world’s foremost martial artists, because hewanted to involve his friends and show his appreciation to them, both asteachers and students. Game of Death would be a crowning achievement."},{"pageContent":" 21GAME OF DEATHIn 1967, when Bruce was given the opportunity to meet the basketball giant BigLew Alcindor, he jumped at it. He had to – Big Lew was over seven feet tall, andBruce was intrigued as to how he might fight a man of that height. Big Lewbecame one of Bruce’s celebrity pupils, and when he later converted to Islam hetook the name Kareem Abdul Jabbar. As the ace centre for the Milwaukee Bucks,and later the Los Angeles Lakers, he became one of the top players in the game.With Way of the Dragon completed, an exhausted Bruce planned to take a shortrest, but in the spring of 1972 – after Fist of Fury was released – when Bruceheard that Jabbar was in Hong Kong, he swiftly arranged some action scenes to befilmed for Game of Death. There was no script for Game of Death as yet, butBruce had enough of an idea of the story to be able to take advantage ofJabbar’s visit, and the two of them spent a week sparring and acting out fightscenes in front of the cameras. To make sure the action was convincing, Brucerehearsed one particular kick nearly 300 times. The result is some intriguingand strangely elegant footage of Bruce fighting a man who towers above him.In Bruce’s mind the opening shot of the film was also clear; his notes read:As the film opens we see a wide expanse of snow. Then the camera closes in on aclump of trees while the sounds of a strong gale fill the screen. There is ahuge tree in the centre of the screen, covered in thick snow. Suddenly there isa loud snap and the branch of the tree falls to the ground. It cannot yield tothe force of the snow, so it breaks. Then the camera moves to a willow tree,which is bending with the wind. Because it adapts to the environment, itsurvives. What I want to say is that a man has to be flexible and adaptable,otherwise he will be destroyed.The rest of the story had been evolving in Bruce’s imagination ever since he’dstood on the northern border of India and looked out on the pagodas of Nepal. Anational treasure is stolen and placed on the top floor of a pagoda on an islandoff the coast of Korea. As the hero, Bruce Lee has to recover the treasure.Outside, the pagoda is defended by a band of fighters, led by a hulk of a man,while inside each floor is defended by a master of a particular martial art. Thepagoda is a training school for martial artists of different traditions, whereeach floor is given over to students of different forms of combat. The climax ofthe film occurs on the uppermost floor where Lee, the master of ‘anything thatworks’, fights Jabbar, the master of ‘no style’, a giant who fightsunpredictably. Here all the rule books are thrown out as each man reliesentirely on his wits and natural native fighting skills. This, the final scene,entitled ‘The Temple of the Unknown’, was now in the can.Bruce Lee was determined that expertise and quality would be the hallmark ofthis film. He intended to assemble the most talented array of fighters availableand had already called on Dan Inosanto to be the guardian of one of the floors.Dan practised escrima, together with its variants kali and arnis, the ancientFilipino art of stick fighting. The art was named by the Spanish conquerors –escrima is Spanish for ‘skirmish’ – who soon realized its effectiveness andbanned it. In the northern Philippines, the movements were kept alive bypractitioners who disguised it as a dance, while in the south, where the nativeMuslims expelled the Europeans, the art continued to flourish.Bruce forwarded a China Airlines ticket to Inosanto, who flew out as soon as hecould make a break in his schedule. Linda met him at Kai Tak airport becauseBruce couldn’t have gone there without being mobbed. Within a couple of daysthey were working out their moves, using a video machine to check the actionafter each take, a technique Bruce pioneered in his Green Hornet days. Overseveral days, they worked out the basis of their episode, which was entitled‘The Temple of the Tiger’.Three weapons are used during this confrontation. First, Inosanto uses thedouble sticks while Bruce uses a Chinese bako, a thin whip-like bamboo. As thetwo face off, Inosanto taps out a traditional challenge with his stick. Bruce’smocking response is the ‘rat-tat-ta-tat-tat’ knock of the postman. After Brucedisarms Inosanto, they pick up nunchakas for a duel to the death. Inosanto hadoriginally introduced Bruce to the weapon; but the resulting footage of thisscene shows that Bruce had mastered it better than his teacher.Inosanto recalls that shortly after he met Bruce in 1964, he showed him a fewbasic escrima techniques. At the time Bruce hadn’t been much impressed andInosanto had thought no more of it. On this visit to Hong Kong, eight yearslater, when the subject came up, Bruce told Dan what he liked and didn’t likeabout what he’d seen of escrima.‘I was flabbergasted when he grabbed the sticks and said, “OK, now I’ll show youwhat I would do,” ’ says Inosanto. ‘I watched him closely, and with no previousbackground or training he ad-libbed a style of escrima he could never have knownexisted. Shocked, I yelled out, “Hey, that’s larga mano!” Bruce said, “I don’tknow what you call it, but this is my method.” ’Inosanto adds that Game of Death was intended to illustrate the same point:‘Bruce wanted to show imagination rising above tradition.’ So while Inosanto wasdressed in the traditional Muslim costume and headband, Bruce wore a modernyellow and black catsuit.Bruce had revelled in the free hand he had in making Way of the Dragon. Now, inGame of Death, he continued to improvise as he went along, taking advantage ofthe fact that the sound would be dubbed on later. Like a silent film director ofold, he even shouted directions to his actors as the cameras were rolling.Bruce forgot all about resting as he enthusiastically planned further duels. Athird combat scene was filmed with Chi Hon Joi, a seventh-degree black belt inthe Korean art of hapkido, which relies on high kicks. While filming theirscene, the Korean had a rigorous enough time of it to comment that he didn’twant to act in any more movies with Bruce Lee. Bruce’s pointed response was thathe was considering re-shooting the scene, this time with a female martial artistcalled Angela Mao.Bruce’s disparaging comment to Chi Hon Joi related to an earlier incident. WhenBruce had been finishing scenes for Way of the Dragon in Hong Kong, another filmHapkido, aka Lady Kung Fu, was being made there with some up-and-coming martialartists called Carter Wong, Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung. The female lead in thefilm was Angela Mao, who was being taught hapkido by the film’s star, Wong InSik, who said he wanted to ‘give her an edge’ over Chinese martial artsactresses. Wong In Sik had apparently been hitting his Chinese stuntmen withoutany holding back, saying he wanted to show that the Korean art was by far themost powerful and effective. Word of this had got to Bruce, who arranged tobring in the Korean for Way of the Dragon. Bruce then gave him a robustdemonstration of the Chinese arts that left him in no doubt of the error of hisways. In doing the same to Chi Hon Joi, Bruce had been making doubly sure hispoint had not been missed.For Game of Death, at a later stage Bruce was planning to include Betty Ting Peiand the Australian actor George Lazenby, but neither they nor Bruce had any ideawhat their roles would be. Lazenby, like Bruce Lee, had shot to fame overnight –in Lazenby’s case, from doing chocolate bar commercials to replacing SeanConnery as James Bond in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service – but Lazenby hadn’tbeen a great success as Bond and his career was in the doldrums. Fortunately thefilm had only just opened in Hong Kong and Lazenby had chosen exactly the righttime to go knocking on Raymond Chow’s door.Taky Kimura, who was also asked to play a role in Game of Death but declined,says, ‘He sent me a plane ticket to go to Hong Kong but I said, “I’ve got threeleft feet and you know it. You don’t need me. Do me a favour, I’m not lookingfor fame and fortune, I’m happy to see you doing well.” He said, “I’m thedirector and producer; everyone looks good in my films.” I said, “I guess Ican’t refuse.” I recognized the feeling behind what he was doing. But in Octoberthe import business I had started was just about to go and I wasn’t able to goto Hong Kong. Then Linda called me and said don’t bother, something else wasbreaking and Game of Death was being put on the back burner.’At the time, Taky Kimura was also going through a severe personal crisis whichleft him emotionally devastated and haunted by the idea of suicide: ‘I lost twobrothers a month apart and then my wife left me,’ he explains. ‘Bruce said,“Taky, I haven’t met your wife, but I’ve counselled you before. You must doeverything in your power to solve the thing but, at some point in time, you mayjust have to walk on.” I’d lost everything. When people tell you things likethat, there’s not always a lot of pith in it, but coming from him . . .’From wherever he happened to be in the world, Bruce would call to give supportto his friend, saying, ‘Walk on, Taky. Just walk on.’When Bruce’s old friend Doug Palmer arrived on a visit to Hong Kong with hiswife, he managed to track Bruce down via Golden Harvest, who passed on amessage.Palmer’s notes recall:Five minutes later the phone in our hotel room rang. ‘You son of a gun,’ Bruceyelled when I answered. ‘What are you doing in Hong Kong?’ He and Linda came andpicked us up and took us back to the huge house he was having work done on in anexclusive part of town called Kowloon Tong. The lot had a high wall around itwith broken glass and spikes set in the top. He had made it, but fame had aprice. His kids had to be escorted to and from school so they would not bekidnapped. My wife, Noriko, had to use the toilet; Bruce produced a bunch ofkeys to unlock the bathroom – apparently he had to keep every room in the houselocked to guard against theft by the workmen.While we were at his house, Bruce was looking through his mail and he read aletter from his old friend, James Lee, in Oakland. I could see Bruce frowning ashe read, then I heard him whisper to Linda to send James five hundred dollars.Bruce told me later that James was dying of cancer.Later we went out to dinner. When we stopped at a light, people on the street orin adjacent cars would gawk in at him. The restaurant was full and we had noreservation, but they soon produced a table. I’m not sure if anyone else in theplace got their dinner because every waiter was hovering near our table.The next day we visited the movie studio where Bruce was filming Game of Death.He had recently brought Kareem Abdul Jabbar over to Hong Kong to shoot a fightscene, which had a very powerful David and Goliath quality about it. Bruce wasvery happy about the way the scene had turned out, in contrast to a more recentone where he had flown in a martial artist from Korea and was very disappointedwith the calibre of the man’s performance.Bruce also had a few stories to tell about Kareem Abdul Jabbar. When he arrivedin Hong Kong, Kareem let it be known that he was very interested in having ‘adate’. Bruce tried to arrange something for him. When the girl showed up and wasintroduced to Kareem, she flat refused. No one had told her how big Kareem was.Kareem became very angry. ‘He’s very sensitive about his height, you know,’ saidBruce, chuckling.In May 1972, Bruce Lee’s boyhood friend Unicorn met with Tang Di, arepresentative of the Sing Hoi Film Company, at the Peninsular Hotel. With thesudden popularity of martial arts films, the company decided it wanted to get inon the act. As Tang discreetly put it to Unicorn, ‘Frankly speaking, your name,of course, won’t sell; but if you have “another” who can help you, the film willnot only sell, it will earn a lot of money.’In short, Bruce Lee’s involvement in the picture was the condition that wouldsecure the starring role for Unicorn. Bruce gave Unicorn the role of the headwaiter in Way of the Dragon, but when Unicorn had presented the idea to Bruce,suggesting that he might do the fight choreography, he didn’t expect him to gofor it. After all, the budget for the film was so low it was close to theearth’s core. Bruce replied that, although he realized he was being manipulated,he would do what he could to help, but when Bruce attended a publicity bash forthe film at the Miramar Hotel in Kowloon, he got all the attention and had toask the press photographers not to ignore Unicorn.As filming started in August 1972, it soon became obvious that Unicorn was outof his depth as a leading actor and again Bruce had to step in. As well assupervising the action, Bruce came up with several script ideas, spending a dayat the set while the cameras rolled.When the film – imaginatively titled Fist of Unicorn – was released soonafterwards, Bruce Lee was not only credited as the martial arts advisor but wasgiven star billing. Footage of Bruce arriving on the set and of him rehearsingthe actors had been contrived to fit a new storyline. Bruce could only issue alegal letter condemning the sorry project, and although Bruce’s friendship withUnicorn continued, the incident increased his wariness of others.As for Unicorn, one reviewer wrote, ‘One only has to witness his stolid approachto every scene, his constipated countenance, resplendent as it is with a neckthat is evidently part of his chin, and eyebrows modelled on Roger Moore attheir tugging fishhook best.’Bruce Lee’s superstar status made him vulnerable to all kinds of exploitation.His name was used to endorse products he’d never heard of, much less used, whilequotes attributed to him were used to hype films he’d never seen. Producersadvertised offers to him in the pages of the Hong Kong press, while seeking onlyto generate publicity for themselves and increase their prestige by some kind ofassociation, however tenuous. The situation in which he now found himself hadchanged so quickly that a normal life was no longer possible. As the pressbecame ever more ridiculous in its excesses, Bruce used to wake up to find partsof a previous evening’s conversation in a restaurant splashed across thenewspapers, and headlines like BRUCE LEE LINKED TO MASS MURDER because hisfriend Kareem Abdul Jabbar had rented a house in the US whose occupants hadrecently been killed.In the 1960s, audiences had tired of Shaw’s musical epics and begun flocking tosee samurai movies. Without missing a beat, Run Run Shaw switched productionfrom the sentimental to the bloody, but soon samurai movies came to a messy end,quickened by a series of speeches made by Chinese leader Chou En Lai attackingJapanese imperialism. With no gunfighting or sword-fighting tradition to basehis films on, Shaw set out to revive kung fu films, starting with The ChineseBoxer, a film whose appeal was a combination of national feeling, secretsocieties and action. This was quickly followed by King Boxer, The Killer andThe New One-Armed Swordsman, starring Wang Yu, who became kung fu’s top star bybeating Shaw’s contract system and hiring himself out on a film-by-film basiswhereby he was able to command a fee of $20,000 per film. These movies broke outof the Oriental market to find success around the world, and the Hong Kong pressstarted calling Shaw ‘Mr Kung Fu’.But audiences were quick to realize that there was a new kid on the block whowas the genre’s natural star. Ironically, Shaw had opened the door for his mostbitter rival to better him. When Newsweek wrote about the emerging phenomenon,the story was headlined: BRUCE LEE: THE BRIGHT STAR RISING IN THE EAST. The LATimes columnist Robert Elegant also wrote an article heralding Bruce, andRaymond Chow lost no time in setting up US distribution.In his office at Golden Harvest, Bruce Lee was besieged with offers thatcontinued to arrive daily. The only reminder of his past struggles was a pair ofbroken spectacles, which he kept to remind him of the time he couldn’t afford tohave them fixed. They were the same spectacles he’d worn when he’d disguisedhimself as a telephone repairman in Fist of Fury. Now he was in an almostunprecedented position for any movie actor, let alone a Chinese one. He waspotentially the highest-paid actor in the world, and could work in Europe, theUS or the Orient, plus he was a partner in his own production company.Some years after Bruce Lee first came to Fred Weintraub’s attention, the Warnersexecutive was still trying to secure him a starring role.Weintraub says, ‘When I kept failing to get a feature going for Bruce, I toldhim to go to Hong Kong and make a film I could show people. He eventually sentme a print of The Big Boss and I went to Richard Ma [Warners head of Asiandistribution] with it because he was the only one who understood the genre. Ialso arranged a private showing for Ted Ashley and he said, “Try and getsomething going.” ’When Bruce completed Fist of Fury, Weintraub was again sent a print. Now, alongwith box-office figures from the Mandarin circuit, Warners realized that FredWeintraub might be on to something, though he adds, ‘There still wasn’t a lot ofenthusiasm for it. Nobody believed it would ever get done.’At the time of Nixon’s high-profile visit to China, awareness of Asian culturewas stirring in America, and Richard Ma thought it might be just the time toexpose kung fu films to a wider audience. Rather than give money to Run Run Shawby taking his films, Ma suggested an original project, saying he knew a guy bythe name of Bruce Lee. Ma had a hard time trying to convince his seniorexecutives that this was a good idea, even though the budget for the proposedfilm was roughly equal to what they’d spend on a TV pilot episode. Fortunately,Warners president Ted Ashley was convinced, so Fred Weintraub and Paul Hellerwere appointed co-producers and a subsidiary company, Sequoia, was set up tomanage the project.Scriptwriter Michael Allin was hired to write a martial arts film to be calledBlood and Steel and Weintraub set off for Hong Kong to do a deal whereby Sequoiaand Concord, the production company Bruce set up with Raymond Chow, wouldco-produce the picture. This proved not to be the simple formality Weintraub hadhoped for, and after two weeks in Hong Kong, he still didn’t have Chow’ssignature on a contract. Although Weintraub found Bruce to be in favour of theproject, he could never seem to get the two Concord partners together in thesame room at the same time. Raymond Chow seemed to be dragging his heels,sensing that he was losing control.Weintraub was about to call it a day, return home and ditch the project, but theevening before he was due to return to the US he decided to give it one lastshot.That evening he managed to get Bruce and Raymond to go to a restaurant, andafter dinner Weintraub told Bruce that Raymond Chow was right to protect him andthat the attempt to go international wasn’t worth risking the successful careerhe had built up in Hong Kong. Weintraub said that it was all academic anyway ashe couldn’t make a deal. Bruce looked over at Chow and said, ‘Make the deal,’ soChow could only smile and add that he thought it was a wonderful idea.In October 1972, Bruce Lee and Raymond Chow flew to the US to finalize thedetails and meet with the actors and director with whom Bruce was to work. Inhis room at the Beverly Wilshire hotel Bruce had hardly unpacked his suitcasebefore he called Steve McQueen to tell him that he was to star in his ownUS-made film. Bruce wasn’t about to take a chance that McQueen might have missedthe many interviews in which he’d reminded McQueen that he was just as famousnow.Bruce Lee then called Stirling Silliphant. Part of a deal Silliphant had justdone with 20th Century Fox included the script of The Silent Flute. The writerthought Bruce would be delighted, but Bruce hadn’t forgotten about India, andfar from giving his blessing to the film being made, he told the writer he wasnow worth a million dollars and that they couldn’t afford him any more, eventhough Coburn and Silliphant had done more than most to help Bruce when he’dbeen struggling. Bruce then suggested that if The Silent Flute were ever made,James Coburn would have to accept second billing. Using the very same words thathad stung him so many years ago, he added, ‘And why should I carry him on myshoulders?’All of Bruce Lee’s closest friends belonged to the period of his life when hewas first and foremost a martial artist. Now, because of his success, he wasexperiencing a shift in his relationship with many of them, like Unicorn. Herealized that these old friendships were changing or fading away, but inenjoying his success, even at the cost of alienating the few people who hadgenuinely helped him, he was now driving some of them away.Perhaps Bruce’s behaviour was partly due to the blow he’d taken when he realizedthat one of his greatest friends, James Lee, was dying of black lung, anoccupational disease of the welding trade. James had been given only weeks tolive when Bruce invited him to Hong Kong for the premier of Way of the Dragon,hoping that James would at least see the city and that Bruce would see his oldfriend before he died. Sadly James wasn’t able to share in Bruce’s success as hewas far too unwell to travel, and he died on 28 December 1972, leaving Bruceemotionally devastated.Two days later, as Bruce grieved, Way of the Dragon opened and, almostunnoticed, surpassed his prediction that it would make $HK5 million by earning$HK5.5 million in the first three weeks of its opening run. Bruce knew that agood deal of his success was due to his friend’s help and encouragement with hisconditioning and training. At times, James Lee had been more like a father tohim than his own father."},{"pageContent":" 22ENTER THE DRAGONBy the time pre-production on the new film began, Bruce had managed to persuadethe studio to change the title, so Blood and Steel became Enter the Dragon. Theproposed $500,000 budget would hardly have covered one episode of a Hollywood TVshow, but by Hong Kong standards it was sufficient for an epic.Although Robert Clouse had only made two features, he got a call from FredWeintraub, inviting him to meet Bruce Lee and Raymond Chow at the Warnersoffices in Burbank, with a view to directing the picture. According to Clouse,he was hired for Enter the Dragon because Bruce had been impressed by a fightscene in one of his films, but according to Fred Weintraub, ‘Nobody else wantedto direct the picture.’ To be fair to Clouse, who began his career as a stillsphotographer at CBS TV, two short films he composed from sequences of stillsboth received Academy nominations in that category.In early February 1973, just after Chinese New Year, the American party followedBruce Lee and Raymond Chow to Hong Kong. Clouse and Weintraub had by now beenjoined by leading lady Ahna Capri, Bob Wall – one of the featured martialartists – and scriptwriter Michael Allin, whose trip to Hong Kong was a perk tocompensate for his low fee. Nobody’s fee for the picture was generous, and itwas for that reason that the world never came to hear of Rockne Tarkington, anactor who quit over his low pay three days before they were due to set off forHong Kong. He was quickly replaced by karate champion Jim Kelly.Robert Clouse wasn’t the first person whose introduction to Bruce Lee was alightning-fast kick that skimmed the end of his nose. On the director’s firstnight in Hong Kong, Bruce insisted they go together to a theatre and watch onehis films. Bruce told Clouse that he wanted him to experience the atmosphere,but the real reason was that when they’d first met, the director hadn’t beenaware of Bruce’s reputation, and Bruce wanted him to know just who he wasworking with. Although this outing was to impress Clouse, it was also forBruce’s benefit, to psych himself up for the production that was about to getunderway.Enter the Dragon follows three international martial artists who enter atournament on an island beyond international jurisdiction. The island is ownedby arch-criminal Han who, conveniently for the martial arts plot, forbidsfirearms on his island. Lee (Bruce Lee) Roper (John Saxon) and Williams (JimKelly) – each has his own reason for being at the tournament, though they allfind themselves at odds with their host, played by Shih Kien.An intelligence agent called Braithwaite has recruited Lee to investigate Han’scriminal operations using his participation in the tournament as cover, but Leealso has personal reasons for dealing with Han, who was expelled from theShaolin temple in disgrace and whose students were responsible for the death ofLee’s sister. Roper and Williams are former army buddies who have both had toleave the US in a hurry. Gambler Roper is wanted by the mob and is hoping to winprize money to pay off his debts, while black-activist Williams is wanted forbeating up a couple of redneck cops who’ve been harassing him. In the course ofthe tournament, they discover that Han uses his untouchable island and thetournament as a front to recruit new talent for his drug-running andprostitution operations, but the three martial artists form an alliance to putan end to this.Bruce Lee was genuinely concerned about the character he was to portray in Enterthe Dragon. After the rejection he’d experienced with the Kung Fu TV series, hewondered if mainstream audiences in the West were ready for a Chinese hero and,at the same time, whether the Chinese audiences would accept his new Westernapproach. He couldn’t be seen to favour the Western element at the expense ofhis own people, nor act in a way that would make him appear foolish to hiscountrymen. While his earlier films also showed him battling against gangstersinvolved in drugs and prostitution, these films all involved factory-floor-levelcrime – the sweatshop or the restaurant – which the overworked and underpaidworkers of Hong Kong could identify with. Now Bruce was no longer simply playingthe naïve country boy for his fellow Chinese; he had to look and act like a manof the world, an Asian Bond at home in both East and West.Scriptwriter Michael Allin made flippant remarks that Bruce needn’t worryhimself about such things, claiming that the only reason the film was gettingmade was that it was cheap and Bruce Lee’s name would guarantee enough of asuccess for the studio to at least recoup its costs. Allin added that the filmwasn’t being made because it was a work of art, and although Bruce tried tobrush his comments aside, he found Allin’s smart-ass routine hard to bear. Thereare stories that Allin made script alterations, knowing that Bruce, like manyAsians, found the letter ‘r’ difficult to pronounce.‘The walls of the dressing rooms were paper-thin,’ Bob Wall recalls, ‘and Bruceoverheard Bob Clouse talking about him, saying that it was ridiculous making afilm with an actor who couldn’t even speak properly. It was Clouse himself whoasked Michael Allin to change the name of the British agent in the script tofuck Bruce up. Clouse changed the character’s name to Braithwaite because heknew Bruce would have trouble with “Yes, Mr Bwaithwaite; no, Mr Bwaithwaite.” Itmade him sound like Donald Duck.’In the end Bruce demanded a new script and the producer suggested Allin lie lowfor a few days. But a few days later, when Bruce was out in public disguised ina beard and dark glasses, he happened to get on the same ferry as Allin. Of allthe millions of people in Hong Kong, they had to meet. Having been under theimpression that the writer had been sent home, Bruce was angry at the deception.From the first day of filming little went right, and major difficulties arosefrom using both American and Chinese crew. There was a shortage of translatorsand often no adequate Chinese words for some of the English jargon and technicalterms, and vice versa. Even the simplest instruction went along a torturousroute of misinterpretation, which was further complicated when people who mademistakes went absent from the set rather than lose face.Hong Kong’s methods were not Hollywood’s. There were no power tools for setconstruction and some of the sets were built from nothing more than chicken wireand mud. The ‘steel bars’ of prison cells were made by shaving down pieces ofscrap wood because the hours of manual labour came cheaper than round lengths ofwood, so 500 Chinese workmen built everything from scratch.After an argument with Raymond Chow, Bruce walked off the set almost as soon ashe’d arrived. Bruce felt that Chow was trying to assert himself as mastermind ofthe project, a situation he found intolerable knowing that it was his owncreative efforts and abilities that would make or break the film, and his owncareer and reputation on the line. There were daily arguments between the twobecause Bruce felt he wasn’t being kept informed of everything that was going onin their partnership, but Chow thought that business was his domain and that hedidn’t have to consult Bruce about every decision. He told Bruce to get on withthe acting.The whole project was coming closer and closer to being cancelled and there wasa growing anxiety that Bruce was about to withdraw from the film. As the dayspassed, he continued to be absent from the set. Warners kept sending telegramspleading ‘WHERE’S BRUCE?’ along with new versions of the script, the latest ofwhich brought Fred Weintraub’s comment that it was ‘a piece of shit; allphilosophy and no action’.On 28 February, as another ‘WHERE’S BRUCE?’ telegram arrived Bruce was in factback at his old school, St Francis Xavier, as guest of honour to present thesports-day prizes. On the platform he stripped to the waist to flex his musclesfor his young admirers, laughing and joking for an hour or two and happy to beaway from all the problems.Meanwhile actor John Saxon arrived in Hong Kong, believing and acting as if hewas the real star of the picture, saying that he’d been hired to give the filmsome class. But there was never any argument about who was the real star ofEnter the Dragon. That week, Bruce Lee’s face was on the cover of no less thantwenty-seven different magazines, adding to the many pressures and tensions hewas feeling. During the years that he managed Neil Diamond and Bill Cosby, FredWeintraub had seen how, as their ambitions were realized, they changed – indeed,they had to change. ‘But Bruce had got so big, so fast,’ adds Weintraub, ‘itscared him.’Bruce Lee was only too aware that Enter the Dragon was the big chance he’dworked his whole life for, but he had yet to prove that he could pull it off,not only to himself but to people like James Coburn and Steve McQueen. Brucekept telling the producer that he would only be happy if Enter the Dragonout-grossed the film McQueen was currently making.In just two furious years, Bruce had made three hit action movies andinterrupted work on a fourth to begin a fifth. Despite the deep inroads he’dmade into writing, acting and directing, it was as if all his incredible energy,self-belief and motivation were suddenly deserting him. He even began to talkabout what should be done ‘if anything happened’ to him. Despite his new-foundfame and massive potential wealth, Bruce was painfully aware that his family’sfuture depended more than anything on his supreme physical fitness and specialabilities. But suddenly everything had become very fragile.Eventually filming started without Bruce as Linda continually assured everyonethat he would eventually show up. Even then the simplest of things would not gosmoothly. A brief scene was attempted in which seven praying mantises, speciallyflown in from Hawaii, were to fight to the death, but they too refused toperform. Meanwhile on the set, real fights broke out between stuntmen and extrashired from rival Triad families, the Chinese crime syndicate that had a fingerin any pie with money in it, including many aspects of the Hong Kong moviebusiness.Run Run Shaw had informants at every level of the production team of Enter theDragon and was well aware of what was happening in the rival camp. While he saidpublicly that the film would never be made, privately he might well have hopedthat it would ruin Raymond Chow. Perhaps seizing an opportunity to makemischief, Shaw invited Robert Clouse and Fred Weintraub to dinner at his opulenthouse in his studio grounds, where they were met at high gates and escorted upthe long sweeping drive by his armed, uniformed guards. At the long dinnertable, Shaw sat next to his associate, the wily Mona Fong. Other guests includedactor William Holden – there to pitch a film version of the book Tai Pan – and aBritish film censor who moralized pompously, saying that he would remove anynunchaka scenes from the British version of Enter the Dragon. While they dinedon snake soup Shaw praised Bruce Lee, showed his concern for the picture andasked questions to which his spies had already told him the answers.Nearly two weeks into the shooting schedule, there was still nothing of BruceLee on film. Fred Weintraub continued to assure Warners that everything wasgoing well, but in reality he began asking Linda what on earth they could do.‘There was a lot of tension,’ Weintraub comments. ‘Bruce was so nervous – he’dwanted this so much – that his tension was the tension of the film. He arguedwith everyone and played everyone off against each other. Sometimes I kept outof the way and sometimes I stepped in to help. But any time I had a real problemI would go to Linda; she was the only one who had the sensibilities to deal withBruce. Enter the Dragon would not have been made without Linda’s help.’Linda made one last attempt to calm Bruce and restore his confidence, thencalled Weintraub and told him that things were going to be all right. But rightaway there was a new problem. In the first scene that Bruce filmed, where he istalking to the female agent played by Betty Chung, his face developed a nervoustwitch that was obvious in close-ups. Nothing was said about it, as long shotsand various angles were improvised. The ploy worked and after lunch thetwitching nerve had settled down, never to reappear.On top of the tremendous psychological stress Bruce Lee was under, enormousdemands were made on his physical energy. In just one take he might have tofight ten or twelve attackers in rapid-fire succession, leaping to the side, tothe front, twisting behind, spinning, striking, kicking, blocking withinch-perfect accuracy and split-second timing, all with the right expressionsand reactions, and all in a way that was totally convincing. He couldn’t evenuse a stand-in to rehearse the other stuntmen because, as the choreographer, hehad worked out and timed all the moves and he needed to fine-tune them himself.And besides, who could match his abilities? Bruce was the only person in theworld who could do what he did. If only one man missed his cue or miscalculated,the whole sequence would have to be run again, meaning that some fight scenesrequired fifteen or twenty takes.The intense demands on Bruce Lee’s physical and nervous energies, the heat andhumidity and the draining ever-present back pain, all dug deeper and deeper intohis internal resources, so that he suffered from dehydration and weight loss atan alarming rate. At night he couldn’t sleep and so spent most of the nightworking out fight scenes and drawing complex diagrams of the action. Peoplewho’d known Bruce for years said his skin tone changed completely and that hedidn’t look well. Even so, on set Bruce declined the privilege of special meals,electing to eat with the rest of the crew. ‘No director could ask more from aperformer,’ wrote Robert Clouse in his book The Making of Enter the Dragon.Bob Wall remembers it differently, though: ‘How Bruce kept from punching outRobert Clouse, I’ll never know. Bruce wasn’t greatly secure in his actingability, but he knew how to direct action – something Clouse had no idea about.While Clouse got at Bruce through Michael Allin, Bruce insisted Clouse be barredfrom the set during fight scenes. Bruce said that if he couldn’t direct theaction then he wouldn’t go on. That’s why Bruce spent so many days not showingup: he refused to show up until Clouse was off the set.’Along with the challenges in front of the camera, Bruce also had to facechallenges off-camera, when he should have been able to snatch a moment’srespite and a cup of his favourite chrysanthemum tea. Bruce got on well with thestuntmen; they had become a team and Bruce had earned their respect just asthey’d earned his. They too were taking risks; unlike the way stunts werearranged in Hollywood, there were no air bags or mattresses out of shot to breaktheir falls, no fake glass bottles or balsa-wood chairs. At any given time oneor two of the stuntmen would be injured, and Bruce did what he could to help,lending them money or arranging a bonus.Along with the professional stuntmen, there were also hundreds of extras –sometimes between three and four hundred – most of them street kids. Every sooften one of these kids would walk up to Bruce and openly question thegenuineness of his abilities. The usual way was to tap one’s foot three times infront of him, a reference to the nickname Bruce had been given by the stuntmen,who called him Bruce Three Legs or Three-Kicks Bruce because he could deliverconsecutive kicks so rapidly.For the most part, Bruce would ignore it, but as he knew only too well, most ofthese kids had little to look forward to and had seen the opportunity for amoment of glory. They might even get in a lucky punch, then who knew whatopportunities might follow for ‘the man who beat Bruce Lee’? Bruce himself wouldnever actually initiate a fight, but if the challenger kept insisting orinsulting him, he might ask what his challenger knew about fighting,anticipating the reply, ‘As much as I need to.’It was in these brief confrontations that one could witness the vast differencebetween Bruce Lee’s movie fighting style and his real fighting method. The moviestyle used a lot of visually spectacular, spinning and flying kicks fromNorthern Shaolin kung fu, whose original purpose was to unseat people attackingon horseback. But when Bruce Lee fought for real, there were no fancy moves andno wild noises, only simple, direct, efficient strikes, with no facialexpression except for the look in his eyes – a fierce, unflinching gaze of whathe himself called ‘controlled cruelty’. He did just as much as he needed to letthe kid know the game was over.There were even newspaper ads in the Hong Kong press offering rewards in theform of movie contracts to any challenger who could topple Bruce Lee. Oneaspiring hero succeeded in getting over the wall and into the compound of Lee’shome on Cumberland Road, where he confronted Bruce with, ‘So just how good areyou?’ The trespasser soon found out as he was side-kicked in the ribs and thrownoff the property. Bruce later admitted he’d kicked him harder than he’d everkicked anyone in his life. ‘I gave it all to him,’ he said.When cameraman Gil Hubbs first arrived at Golden Harvest studios he’d found mostof the camera equipment in a bad state of disrepair and none of the lenses hewanted to use. Hubbs took the initiative of hiring the equipment he needed fromanother supplier, upsetting both the producers and Golden Harvest, who werepresented with additional costs. Even so, the entire picture was shot using justtwo cameras and three lenses. The second cameraman, Charles Lowe, was presentedwith similar problems in the lighting department, where equipment was so badlyrusted it was, he said, good only for one last stand in India. To add todifficulties there were voltage fluctuations in the electricity supply. On topof all this the Golden Harvest studios were originally a textile mill and thedaily rushes were usually covered in tiny white specks.Contrary to usual production methods, sound was recorded while filming, but itwas impossible to keep the hundreds of extras and crew quiet during shooting. Afeast scene was scheduled, but there was no food. Someone misinterpreted anorder and instead of doves, frogs arrived. Props that had been there the daybefore weren’t there the next. Lighting set-ups were changed overnight, meaningthat scenes had to be shot all over again. Extras who arrived for an excitingday in the movie business found themselves sitting around for hours, so wouldfail to show up the next day.As the sumo wrestlers ate their way through tons of food, there was theoccasional flutter of feathers as an exotic bird tumbled from its perch, roastedby the heat of an arc lamp. Each morning the sound stages had to be cleared ofdogs and squatters who had spent the night sleeping on the couches or floor. Thehundreds of extras needed to play the derelict prisoners were actual derelictsrecruited from the streets of Hong Kong. There was a problem getting actressesto play prostitutes, so real prostitutes were hired. Actress and martial artschampion Angela Mao got only $100 for her two days’ work, while chief cameramanGil Hubbs was making only $250 a week. At $150 a day, the hookers were thebiggest wage earners on Enter the Dragon, resulting in a lot of ill feeling onset.While filming the scene where Lee tricks Parsons onto the dinghy that’s beingtowed along behind the junk taking them to Han’s Island, the actor Peter Archeralmost drowned. Seconds after the scene was cut, the boat capsized, dumping theactor into the churning waters of the China Sea. There were several furtheraccidents, two of which involved Bruce Lee.In the early part of Bruce’s fight with Bob Wall, he kicks Wall over a row ofchairs and through a line of Han’s men. Wall picks up two bottles, which werethere to provide water for the tournament contestants, smashes their endstogether and confronts Bruce with a broken bottle in each hand. This being HongKong, these were real bottles, not the sugar fake bottles normally used forstunts like this. So far everything had gone precisely as rehearsed, but as BobWall moved in, Bruce kicked and then whipped round to punch him, hitting theedge of the broken bottle with his hand. The assistant director, Chaplin Chang,had to rush Bruce to hospital by car where twelve stitches were required toclose a deep gash on his finger. He was unable to resume work for several days.The stuntmen took a dark view of this, convinced that it was no accident.Bruce’s deeply superstitious countrymen grew more and more restless until therewas a meeting in which he got entangled in their speculation that theseincidents might not have been entirely accidental. There was a sense of paranoiain the air. Robert Clouse writes that meanwhile he had received a call fromRaymond Chow saying that, in order to save face, Bruce would have to get hisrevenge on Wall and that it was up to the director to find a way out of theproblem. Clouse says that Bruce had intended ‘to kill’ Bob Wall and the directorclaims he had to tell Bruce to back off because Wall was needed for furtherfilming and had to stay healthy for the good of the picture.‘Clouse’s account is bullshit,’ counters Wall. ‘We’d already shot that sceneseven times before the accident. Not only that, I was breaking real bottles andthen having to fall to the ground like a slain ox without being able to lookdown and see where all the glass had landed.’Bob Wall is now a real estate broker and entrepreneur in California. Wheninterviewed in his office he recalls the incident and springs up from behind hisdesk to demonstrate how the fight had been choreographed. He was to lunge atBruce’s chest with a broken bottle; Bruce would block it with a kick to Wall’sforearm, then turn quickly to deliver a spinning back-kick. On the eighth take,Bruce’s first kick landed fractionally high so he didn’t deflect Wall’s arm farenough. Then when he spun out of his kick there wasn’t enough clearance,resulting in his hand striking the broken glass.I called Bruce at home and asked him if he’d heard the rumours,’ Wall continues.‘He said that he had. I asked him if he intended to kill me and he replied thathe’d said no such thing. We could never prove it, but we were convinced thatClouse made up the whole story and spread the rumour. Sure Bruce got cut, but itwas an accident. If Bruce had wanted to kill me he had several opportunities. Weretook that scene about ten times; all he needed to do was kick me a bit higheror a bit lower than he did.’Yet on one of those takes Bruce did kick Wall so hard that an extra positionedto catch him sustained a broken arm from the impact. ‘Bruce knew I could take agood shot,’ says Wall. ‘He didn’t want fake reactions.’ Wall took several goodshots and emerged covered in red welts, bringing at least some satisfaction tothe complaining stuntmen. The fact that there was only one timing-relatedaccident between them shows the phenomenal level of control at which Bruce andhis opponents worked.Jim Kelly was also imposing as martial artist but the same couldn’t be saidabout John Saxon. Robert Clouse wrote that Saxon believed himself to be the‘class’ in the film. Like Elvis Presley, Saxon had dabbled in karate to enhancehis image, but while the camera pulls back to record the explosive grace ofBruce Lee on screen, Saxon’s action sequences require close-up shots to disguisehis limited abilities.Robert Clouse wrote:I have been asked many times if Bruce was really as fast as people claimed. AllI can say is he had the fastest reflexes I’ve ever seen. In one shot, Bruce wasin a standoff with Bob Wall. In order to see his hand lash out and hit Bob, wehad to speed the camera up to thirty frames [a second]. At normal speed itdidn’t show on film.The film’s editor, Kurt Hirshler, had the perfect opportunity to study Bruce:stopping the film, slowing it down and running it back and forth, just as Brucehad done when studying the actions of boxing champions. Viewing Bruce’s standoffwith Wall he was intrigued to see that within a single frame of film Bruce’sfist had shot out without warning.A second accident happened while preparing to shoot a scene with a cobra. Beforeeach take, in order to get the hood around the cobra’s head to flare out, Brucewould rap the snake across the nose a few times. Finally it struck back.Fortunately, the snake had just been drained of venom, but Bruce was leftwounded and shaken. ‘Bruce had beaten the snake nine times before it beat him,’adds Bob Wall.During the last two weeks Bruce stayed on with the director while they filmedthe fight sequence between Lee and Han in the mirrored maze. This sequence wasnot in the original script, which ended with Han impaled on his own metal claw,but was improvised. At one time or another almost everyone except Bruce hastaken credit for this idea. A box, about six feet square and faced in mirrorglass, was placed in the centre of a room lined with mirrors. From any positionin the room there were multiple reflections. Against one wall, three mirroredbooths were constructed, which further fragmented the images, and a glass hidewas built to cover the camera.When the sequence was being shot Shih Kien was forced to call out, ‘Take iteasy, son. It’s only a movie!’ The actor, who had played the villain in theMaster Kwan films Bruce had watched as a boy, was a veteran of some 800 martialarts films and had spent over fifty years training in kung fu daily. Now oversixty, Shih Kien was older than he looked.Robert Clouse wrote:In the end, it was all worth it. You couldn’t have recreated that Orientalatmosphere in Hollywood for a million dollars. The sights and sounds, even thesmells, combined to create a feeling of intense realism for everyone involved inthe production and I believed that quality would come over on the screen.The atmosphere in Han’s dungeons must have been pretty realistic; there werehundreds of hookers and tramps pressed together for hours in claustrophobicinteriors with no ventilation or air conditioning. The final scenes of Enter theDragon were shot hurriedly as the dungeon scenery began to crack and crumblearound them. In the climactic mass fight on the tournament field, the rehearsedencounter rapidly turned into a free-for-all between rival families of Triadswho took the opportunity to settle old scores, and the fights continued longafter the cameras had stopped filming.The fight scene in the underground caves ranks as one of Bruce’s most stunningsequences on film. Eliminating Han’s guards, first in ones and twos, he is soondealing with them in increasing numbers, now using a series of weapons: thepole, the kali sticks and the nunchakas. To try and describe the complexfluidity and flow would be a long and futile exercise; it is enough to say thatas a movie martial artist Bruce’s ability had become almost luminous.The first time he ever saw Bruce Lee in Enter the Dragon, the singer songwriterPhil Ochs, a contemporary of Bob Dylan, was moved to write an article for TimeOut magazine about it:It is not the vulgarity of James Arness pistol-whipping a drunken, stubbledstage robber. It is not the ingenious devices of James Bond coming to therescue, nor the ham-fisted John Wayne slugging it out in the saloon overcrumbling tables and paper-thin imitation glass. It is the science of the bodytaken to its highest form; and the violence, no matter how outrageous, is alwaysstrangely purifying.In Enter the Dragon, Bruce Lee moved as fluidly and as gracefully as Ali movedin his prime, but with a rhythm that was all his own. And he was fast, too . . .faster! So explosive were his punches that the camera speed had needed to beadjusted so they could be captured. Even then, you could only see moves beginand end, with nothing in between. Punches and kicks . . . and yet much, muchmore. Lee’s limbs swooped and stabbed in such a poetically precise way that hisblows seemed to slice the air into pieces.Bruce Lee was one of the only genuinely graceful men we had ever seen. Womenwere often graceful; but men, even the great dancers, almost never were. Leeused hands and feet, knees and elbows, shoulders and head – his entire body –with perfect grace and balance. Pushing the laws of physics and human anatomy totheir limits, already larger than life to begin with, but now even three timeslarger, luminous and incandescent, twenty foot tall on the screen. Even when hewas standing still, there was something inside him that shimmered – something soalive it continued to tremble and vibrate.Yet although he was the little guy who could righteously whip one bad guy afteranother with unthinkable speed, power, accuracy and dynamic beauty, there wasalso a kind of eggshell fragility about him. And as we watched, awestruck andenchanted, somewhere at the back of it all we realized . . . that he was nolonger alive."},{"pageContent":" 23CIRCUMSTANCESAnticipating that Enter the Dragon would be a massive success, Bruce Lee ordereda gold Rolls Royce Corniche. The Shrine of Ultimate Bliss was intended to beBruce Lee’s next film, but before the release of Enter the Dragon, and before hecould complete the interrupted work on Game of Death or take delivery of his newcar, Bruce Lee had died.The Shrine of Ultimate Bliss would have pitted Lee against a Western adversaryplayed by James Bond actor George Lazenby, who’d been signed to a three-picturedeal by Concord Productions. The film’s original tagline was ‘It’s Lee! It’sLazenby! It’s Bruce Versus Bond!’As with Enter the Dragon, Warners were going to co-produce and distribute thefilm. The planned production budget of $10 million and worldwide marketingbudget of a further $10 million were astronomical sums at the time. We can onlyspeculate what Bruce’s earnings might have been.Other projects had also been proposed. There was a possible film starring Bruceand Elvis Presley – the king of kung fu and the king of rock and roll. SophiaLoren’s husband, the film producer Carlo Ponti, called and offered ‘asubstantial sum to be determined’ to secure Bruce’s name on a contract. OneHungarian producer offered two million dollars for Bruce to appear in . . .anything. There is simply no doubt that Bruce Lee was poised to become thebiggest star in the world and well on his way to fulfilling his ‘impossible’written affirmation that he would earn ten million dollars by 1980.But on 10 May 1973, Bruce Lee was in a dubbing room at Golden Harvest studios,looping dialogue for Enter the Dragon, repeatedly recording his voice over ashort loop of film until the new voice matched the original speech movement asclosely as possible. Inside the tiny room it was sweltering, but theair-conditioning unit had been shut down to avoid its noise being recorded.Another typhoon was approaching and the heaviness in the air pressed down on theback of his neck like a giant hand in a wet glove.Bruce was still drained from the gruelling weeks of filming and had spent manydays under these conditions, so no one was surprised when said he felt a bitfaint and needed to get out for a minute. He went to a lavatory in the nextbuilding and splashed his face with cold water to clear his head, but suddenlyhe was falling . . . as the scene faded and dissolved to black.Out of the darkness he heard footsteps approaching as he slowly came round andpretended he was looking for his glasses, which had fallen to the floor. ButBruce had been lying there unconscious for over twenty minutes and the studioassistant who’d been sent to look for him had to help him to his feet. Bruce waspale and sweating buckets, and he had to be helped further as he walked shakilyback to the dubbing room. Then suddenly he collapsed again as his body waswrenched into a vomiting fit that left him struggling for breath and feeling asif he were fighting a dark shadow, just as he’d done in the middle of thatfateful night in his room above Ruby Chow’s restaurant.Bruce was rushed to the nearby Baptist Hospital where an American doctor,Charles ‘Don’ Langford, saw that he was running a fever of 105 degrees andwouldn’t respond to any stimuli. Now and again, Bruce’s eyes would flicker open,though they couldn’t focus, and every breath seemed like his last gasp as hisbody lathered with sweat. Langford immediately summoned neurosurgeon Dr Peter Wuand anaesthesiologist Dr Cecilia Wong while an anaesthesia machine wasimprovised as a respirator with a breathing tube into Bruce’s throat and anintravenous glucose drip was set up.Various suggestions about the cause of the collapse were considered in rapidsuccession – exhaustion, kidney failure, epilepsy – and the appropriate actionswere discussed. When a swelling of fluid pressing on the brain was discovered,most credence was given to the diagnosis of cerebral oedema. When Bruce lapsedinto complete unconsciousness, it was decided to give him Manitol (a dehydratingagent) to reduce the swelling that had been detected by Dr Wu, and a catheterwas set up to drain the flow of urine, which was a side effect of themedication.Don Langford says, ‘From being semi-comatose he suddenly became very agitated –it was almost a seizure – and he could have injured himself, so we had to tapehis arms and legs down. Even between four of us we had trouble controlling him.Then we got ready to perform brain surgery should there be no improvement.’During an anxious two-hour wait, it was obvious to everyone that Bruce wasfighting for his life. When he showed signs of pulling back from the brink, heopened his eyes and stared out in confusion.‘By the time we got him into the ambulance,’ Dr Langford continues, ‘to take himto St Theresa’s, where there were beds available, he was still out of it andcouldn’t speak coherently. Both Dr Wu and I knew that he’d been very close todeath.’The police statement made later by Dr Peter Wu contains the followingparagraphs:8) . . . Mr LEE was interviewed along with his wife in his ward on 13th May, 1973,when he told me that he had taken a piece of cannabis leaf before the onset ofhis illness on 10th May 1973.9) Mr LEE requested to be discharged on 13th May, 1973. He refused to take othertests and revealed that he would be leaving for the U.S.A. in a couple of weeks’time. He stated that he would have the tests in the U.S.A.10) My clinical diagnosis on Mr LEE were [sic]: (1) cerebral oedema, and (2)poisoning by cannabis suspected.The doctors agreed that something strange had happened, and along with otherinformation they wanted to know everything that Bruce had eaten around the timeof the collapse. When it came to light that one of the things he’d eaten was ahash cookie, it was suggested that he may have had a bad reaction to the drug.He was advised not to eat it any more. He didn’t follow their advice.Two weeks later, Bruce and Linda Lee flew to Los Angeles, checked into a privatebungalow in the grounds of the Beverly Hills Hotel, then went to the Universityof California Medical Center, where a team led by Dr David Reisbord gave Bruce acomplete physical examination, including exhaustive brain tests. Eventually theycould only accept the diagnosis of the doctors in Hong Kong that Bruce hadsuffered a convulsion of no identifiable cause, accompanied by excess fluidaround the brain. Dr Reisbord prescribed Dilantin, a drug used to calm the brainactivity of epileptics, and discharged Bruce with the remark that his body wasin superb condition.During the following week, Bob Wall saw Bruce several times and says:The last time I was at Bruce’s little Japanese house in Kowloon Tong, we’d had aspirited disagreement about the relative merits of wine and hash. I encouragedhim to drink wine to relax and told him that a couple of glasses of wine with ameal is considered beneficial, that he didn’t have to get drunk and that hecould use it without misusing it.Bruce was enthusing about this article he’d read in Playboy about the relaxingeffects of hash. Because Bruce neither drank nor smoked, he liked the idea ofputting hash in cookies. I told him that there was no way you could know thesource or quality of hash, whereas with a bottle of wine there’s a label withthe name of the vineyard.’Bruce countered that he only bought the best quality and as I sipped my wine,Bruce ate a hash cookie. As the evening wore on, the spirited debate turned toconversation on the martial arts and philosophy, with Bruce becoming mellow,relaxed and charming.But later Bruce was miserable; he looked chalky white and thin, nervous andupset. I tried to get him to join me in training but he didn’t even go outrunning once that whole week. That just wasn’t Bruce Lee. He told me, ‘I’mgetting checks poked at me from everywhere . . . people are making up storiesabout me. Fame isn’t what I thought it would be. I haven’t got time to train.’Bruce, who was always so clear in his intentions and direction, now seemedjumbled, unsure and just plain worn out. He would repeat himself in aconversation. He told me that his collapse had really scared him and he thoughthe was going to die. I told him to take a couple of months off, but he said,‘But I’ve got to promote the film, there’s the Johnny Carson Show . . .’ He knewit was all finally happening for him and he didn’t want to lose it; he wasscared that everything he’d worked so hard for was suddenly going to be takenaway. Yet at the same time he wondered if it was all worth it. Bruce was puttinga lot of pressure on himself.While in Los Angeles, Bruce went to an early screening of Enter the Dragon atthe Warners studio. The music soundtrack and sound effects were yet to be added,along with the fades, dissolves and other optical effects, but even so, at theend of the screening, when the house lights came on, Bruce punched the air andexclaimed, ‘This is the one!’ The Warners executives also knew it was a winner,and even though they’d already gone over budget, they immediately authorized anextra $50,000 to upgrade the music soundtrack and began stepping up publicityfor the film’s release and the premiere, which was to be held at Grauman’sChinese Theatre in Hollywood on 24 August, to be followed by Bruce’s appearanceon The Johnny Carson Show in New York.The buzz about Enter the Dragon flew around the industry grapevine. Suddenlyevery studio and producer in the world had a project that was absolutely perfectfor Bruce Lee. Warners had already asked him to sign for five more features,offering to pay him $150,000 per film, per year, for life. In truth, he couldhave got double or treble that, and more.Aside from personal strain, there were also business conflicts. When Warnersdecided they wanted to change the title of Enter the Dragon back to the earlierBlood and Steel, Bruce fiercely disputed it. The studio responded by conceivinga new title that was spectacular in its awfulness, and Bruce was only able tomake them back off by threatening never to work for them again. A week later,Han’s Island had once more become Enter the Dragon.In June 1973 Bruce resumed work on Game of Death and picked up his runningbattle with the Hong Kong press over his relationship with Betty Ting Pei.Golden Harvest’s press office responded that many of the rumours and allegationscirculating were transparent lies started by unknown persons at Shaw BrothersStudios.On a business note, Bruce Lee’s ‘concord’ with Raymond Chow was now turning intodiscord. Even though Bruce was drawing a salary of $HK12,500 a week – with$1,000 for ‘living expenses’ – not only was he questioning the accounting forWay of the Dragon, he was also angry that Chow had gone ahead with foreignrelease deals while he’d wanted to hold out for better offers. He was also upsetby a story that had appeared in Golden Harvest’s in-house magazine, whichclaimed that Chow had not only discovered Bruce Lee but was ‘like a babysitter’to him. Bruce retorted that the article made him sound like a stupid child whorelied solely on Raymond, and he began to put pressure on Chow by asking Run RunShaw for $HK2 million to do a film for Shaw Brothers.Bruce even went as far as shooting some test footage for a film in which hewould act traditional Mandarin warrior roles. Of course he had no intention ofsigning a contract with Shaw or of going through with the project, but he knewthat Shaw would trumpet news of the project from the headlines of the Hong Kongnewspapers. It was simply a ploy to deliver a straightforward message to Chow.On 10 July, Bruce Lee was at Golden Harvest studios when he heard that Lo Weiwas in the building. Lo Wei, who had incensed Bruce by proclaiming himself ‘HongKong’s first millionaire director’ and the ‘man who taught Bruce Lee how tofight’, found that now he was no longer involved with Bruce, his genius hadsuddenly deserted him. Even so, Bruce couldn’t resist confronting Lo Wei andberating him. He burst into the screening room where the director was viewing afilm called Snake Girl, along with his wife and Chow’s partner, Leonard Ho. AsBruce yelled at him, Lo Wei didn’t react, knowing it was futile to fight withBruce, then Bruce returned to Chow’s office.Minutes later, Mrs Lo Wei appeared to tell Bruce he should behave with moredecorum. This had quite the opposite effect and as tempers flared a small crowdgathered. Bruce then charged back to the screening room and denounced Lo Weifurther. In the end the police were called after Lo Wei claimed that Bruce hadpulled out a short knife concealed in his belt buckle and threatened to stabhim. But the police couldn’t find the knife and attempted to smooth over thesituation rather than make arrests and involve lawyers. Lo Wei insisted thatBruce sign a hastily composed ‘cease and desist’ letter, promising simply, ‘I,Bruce Lee, will leave Lo Wei alone.’ The whole studio was in uproar, and inorder to get the police and the newly arrived reporters out of the way, Brucesigned the letter. Later he became annoyed when he realized that this gave LoWei’s version of events more substance.That evening, when Bruce appeared on Enjoy Yourself Tonight, the incident wasraised by the show’s host, Ho Sho Shin. Bruce explained that if he really wantedto kill anyone, he wouldn’t need to use a knife but could simply strike with hishands. But on the TV show, and at the host’s insistence, Bruce offered to give aslightly less drastic demonstration of his skills. Although it was only a simpleshoulder push, Ho was sent sprawling across the floor. To viewers – unused tothe rigours of martial arts training – it looked severe, as if Bruce had slammedinto the host hard. This resulted in yet another wave of critical headlines, andworse still, all of them tended to sympathize with Lo Wei and the day’s eventswere cited as further evidence of Bruce’s growing arrogance.Bruce once famously said, ‘Circumstances? Hell, I make circumstances!’ But now‘circumstances’ were becoming ugly intrusions into his life, along with thepainful realization that success was not what he’d anticipated it would be. Asthe cyclone of celebrity began to gather its force he’d started drinking, and atone dinner drank his way through twenty pots of sake. Where once Bruce hadsupplemented his natural vitality with ginseng and royal jelly, vitamins andherbal teas, now he drank liquidized steak for strength, chewed cannabis anddrank sake to help him relax, and his complexion had become pale and dull.Just as life now offered Bruce Lee its worst, so Bruce Lee was showing the worstaspects of himself. He spent many nights away from home, sometimes at thestudio, working through another restless night with ideas for Game of Death,while at other times he made his way . . . elsewhere. His mood swings alsobecame more pronounced. He’d say he still wanted to act, but not make any moremartial arts films, adding that the public would only be interested in kung fumovies for about three years. Then the next day, he’d reaffirm his aim ofwanting to educate audiences through the medium of film so that they wouldunderstand there was more to martial arts than just fighting.One minute Bruce could see no end to his possibilities; the next he had no ideaif he could maintain the effort needed to realize them. The more he did, themore he felt the need to stretch himself. He would cut people short, tellingthem that ‘trying to relax’ is a contradiction. Even Bruce’s friends perceivedthat he was being pulled in opposite directions: he was either pressed down by agreat burden or spiralling away aimlessly. Bruce recalled Yip Man’s advice giventwenty years before, that nobody can oppose a problem head-on, they have to flowwith it.Attempting to apply this wisdom to his accelerating life, Bruce decided that theanswer was to match the speed of change happening around him. Linda Lee latermade the analogy that even a car like a Ferrari can’t stand being driven withits rev counter permanently over the red line. After all her efforts to get himstarted on the set of Enter the Dragon, she now felt powerless to apply thebrakes. Even Linda’s mother expressed her concern about Bruce, telling TakyKimura, ‘He’s losing weight. Tell him to rest, he’ll listen to you.’All Bruce’s relationships had become riddled with suspicion. Bruce told ThomasChan, an actor who’d had a minor role in Fist of Fury, that he had a mountain ofmoney in front of him if he wanted it, but the people who offered the moneythought it would buy Bruce; they believed they would own him. ‘I must be very,very careful,’ Bruce told Chan. Friends could only witness his increasingisolation.Fred Weintraub says that Bruce was now a different person to the one he’d beenonly weeks before in Los Angeles, adding that he was no longer so friendly andkept others at a distance.The actress Nora Miao says, ‘Bruce Lee felt lonely in the few months before hisdeath. He was a changed man. He used to phone me and tell me he felt lonely. Itold him, “No one dares get close to you!” Confused, he said, “Why? Why do Ifeel that I don’t have a real friend when there are so many people around me?” Isaid “It’s not so strange. You’ve become an idol. People only flatter you. Then,when they do this, you despise them. On the other hand, if they criticize you,you resent it. You are a victim of fame.” ’Perhaps Bruce Lee now had occasion to recall what his mother had told him whenhe was ten years old, when he’d told her of his ambitions and she’d replied,‘The life of a famous film star is not so comfortable as you imagine. Theirlives are abnormal.’Grace Lee recalls, ‘Following his increasing fame, he became thinner andthinner. When he returned to Los Angeles after finishing Way of the Dragon hehad lost a lot of weight. I told him, “Have a good rest and relax a little.” Iwas really worried about his health. Later, he started filming Enter the Dragon.When I saw him in May 1973, I couldn’t believe the person in front of me was myson, he had changed so much. He told me that he wouldn’t live much longerbecause doctors in Hong Kong had told him there was a serious problem inside hishead. He said, “Mom, don’t worry about your future, there will be no moneyproblems.” I reproached him at once and told him not to talk like that.’Maria Yi also noticed a worrying trait: ‘Before he died, he developed amnesia.Sometime after filming The Big Boss, when I visited him at the studio, he oftentook out a picture of his car and asked me to admire it. He repeated this actionseveral times a day without knowing that he’d done it before. It was veryunsettling.’On 16 July, as a fierce typhoon approached Hong Kong, Bruce made a rambling $200phone call to Unicorn, who was in a hotel in Manila where he was working onlocation. Bruce told his friend he was worried about the headaches he wasexperiencing.The feng shui advisor who’d been called in to look over the house that Bruce hadbought in Kowloon Tong wasn’t happy. The area had a reputation for bringing downwealthy families, symbolized by its situation at the lowest point of adepression in the landscape. The two previous owners of Bruce’s house had bothsuffered financial reversals. Additionally, the house was on the landingapproach to Kai Tak airport, meaning that the natural wind currents weredisturbed, while the house itself was facing the wrong way. The feng shui mandevised a solution: a mirrored figure was placed on the roof of the building toreflect away the bad influences. On 18 July, this figure was blown off the roofby the approaching typhoon.On the morning of 20 July 1973, Bruce Lee sat down to type a letter to hislawyer Adrian Marshall in Los Angeles. There were possibly some big changesahead. Bruce wrote about meeting Raymond Chow to ‘hear him out’. He listed fivedeals to be considered and anticipated spending the whole weekend looking atthese offers with Marshall, working out a tax plan and endorsement deals forbooks and clothes. There were details of a hectic promotional tour for Enter theDragon, including the trip to New York for the Johnny Carson Show. Bruce addedthat by 24 August he would be ready to come back to Hong Kong, ‘hopefully in onepiece’.That evening, typhoon Dorothy lashed warm rain hard against the windows of theHotel Miramar, where Raymond Chow and George Lazenby sat in the opulentrestaurant. They ordered another aperitif and made small talk as they waitedpatiently for Bruce Lee and Betty Ting Pei to show up for dinner. It was to bean informal meeting to discuss ideas for Game of Death. But at Betty’s apartmentover on Beacon Hill Road, the actress was becoming desperate as she tried torouse Bruce from sleep, shaking him and then slapping him across the face.Earlier in the day, Bruce and Raymond Chow had met with Betty at her apartmentbefore Chow left alone. Shortly after, Bruce complained of a headache and, afterbeing given an Equagesic headache pill by Betty, he went to lie on the bed.Now, at just after nine o’clock in the evening, Chow received a call from Betty.He left the hotel and drove to her apartment, which took some thirty or fortyminutes due to bad traffic. When he too could get no response from Bruce,Betty’s doctor was summoned and then, after further delay, an ambulance wasfinally called. The ambulance arrived at the same time as Betty’s mother andbrother who had been summoned to try to calm the distressed actress. RaymondChow phoned Linda Lee, telling her to get over to the Queen Elizabeth Hospitalwhere Bruce was being taken.Linda rushed to the hospital and arrived before the ambulance. There was anaching wait until the doors burst open and Bruce was rushed in, unconscious, ona stretcher, surrounded by a swarm of paramedics, one of whom was thumping onBruce’s chest, trying to keep his heart going. Events blurred – emergency room,stimulant injections, then electric shock pads – but despite the franticactivity, Bruce lay still. After the whirlwind of the past few weeks, hours andseconds, it took an eternity for the truth to hit home.As the momentum of events picked up gradually, Raymond Chow’s wife arrived tocollect her husband and take Linda home. There was a long, slow walk down a calmwhite hospital corridor and suddenly they were confronted by a starburst offlashbulbs and a babble of reporters.‘Every week there would be a new rumour,’ Taky Kimura says. ‘Someone would say,“I see that Bruce was killed in a tournament last week.” I would hear stuff likethat from all over. One day, one of my packers told me, “Bruce Lee is dead; it’sin all the papers.” I didn’t even bother to check. Then Linda’s mother rang andtold me . . .’Grace Lee also didn’t believe the news of her son’s death. For months storieshad been appearing in the Hong Kong press saying he was dead. She wouldimmediately call up the paper or magazine to see if it was true and it neverwas. When she told Bruce how much the stories upset her, he would explain theobvious: that they were simply lies to sell magazines. He told her that the nexttime she heard or read such a story, she shouldn’t believe it. When one of GraceLee’s friends called her, crying, with the news that Bruce was dead, she toldher friend that it was a lie, but her friend said she hadn’t read it in amagazine, she’d seen it on TV. When Grace Lee found out it was true, she saidsimply, ‘Too much work.’Linda Lee’s immediate reaction was to consent to the suggestion that an autopsybe done. In the circumstances, it was deemed important enough for the BritishGovernment forensic laboratories to perform it three days later, on 23 July.In the meantime, speculation was fuelled by Raymond Chow’s first account to thepress of events on the night of Bruce Lee’s death, which implied that Bruce haddied at home with his family. Perhaps Chow was simply trying to spare Linda’sfeelings, knowing full well what the press would make of the actual situation.In any case, the first reports to be sent around the world said that Bruce haddied at home. One paper romanticized things further by reporting that Bruce haddied while walking in his garden with his wife. But Henry Parwani, a reporterfrom The Star – the same paper that was the subject of Bruce’s legal action –went to the hospital to look over the ambulance call-out records and found thecall had not come from Bruce’s home but, as he had suspected, from the apartmentof Betty Ting Pei. And so, on the day before the funeral The Star’s headlineblazed: DRAGON KILLED IN BETTY TING PEI’S FRAGRANT CHAMBER.Like Grace Lee, nobody could believe that the fittest man in the world had diedat thirty-two. One could almost hear the anguished echoes from the openingscenes of Fist of Fury as Chen Zhen discovers the death of his master: ‘How cana healthy man die!’ Even on the very day of his death, one of the first rumoursto surface was that it was all a publicity stunt to promote Game of Death.People were laying bets on whether or not it was true.Another early headline suggested that Bruce Lee had died of an overdose of theaphrodisiac Spanish fly. Journalists went back through the photo files for anyshots of him with a woman. One paper printed five pages of him with differentwomen, smiling with his arm around them, with the implication that every singleone had been his lover. Speculation swept through Hong Kong on a tidal wave ofhigh emotion, and word at the Press Club was that Bruce had been involved in abig fight with ten or twenty men who had beaten him to death.On 25 July, Bruce Lee’s ‘symbolic’ funeral was the largest Hong Kong had everwitnessed. Three hundred police were put on duty outside the Kowloon FuneralParlour where his body lay in an open bronze casket. Thirty thousand mournershad gathered to fill Maple Street, crowding balconies and lining the roofs asfar as the eye could see. Inevitably people fainted and were injured in thepushing and shoving as emotions ran high.Whenever the crowd spotted Nora Miao, Lo Wei, George Lazenby or othercelebrities arriving at the steps of the funeral home, they started clapping andcheering, prompting the South China Morning Post to describe the scene as ‘acarnival’. Of the gaggle of minor local stars who turned up, some had come topay their respects, while others just came for the photo opportunity. Two peoplenot seen were Run Run Shaw and Betty Ting Pei.Inside the funeral parlour the midsummer air was thick and stifling with thearoma of flowers and incense. On arrival, each mourner would pay his respects atan altar where small bunches of flowers from tearful children lay next toexpensive wreaths. Candles and incense burned before a photograph of Bruce,surrounded by long silk ribbons and flowers, above which hung a banner that readin Chinese: A STAR SINKS IN THE SEA OF ART. Each mourner bowed three times atthe altar, then took their place in the hall.Then came the sad arrival of Linda Lee, red-eyed behind her dark glasses andalmost buried in the folds of her traditional mourning clothes: a white burlaprobe and headdress. The children, Brandon and Shannon, were each in their ownlittle white robes, blissfully unaware of what was happening as they took theirplaces. To their side sat Bruce’s mother Grace, his brother Peter and Unicorn,who had returned from Manila.The band struck up the traditional funeral song. Now Bruce’s coffin was broughtin and situated near the altar for the mourners to file past. His body layswathed to the chin in white silk and his face looked grey and somehow distortedunder heavy make-up. In the pocket of his suit were his broken spectacles. Longafter the funeral was over, police with loudspeakers patrolled the streets,urging people to go home.The day after the ceremony in Hong Kong, Linda left for Seattle with Bruce’sbody. At Kai Tak airport, Linda, now dressed in black and her face strained withsorrow, read out a press statement in an attempt to stop the mountingcontroversy surrounding Bruce’s death. Linda said she knew what made goodheadlines, and asked what difference it made anyway.The tickets that were to have been used to travel to New York for Bruce’sappearance on the Johnny Carson Show had been traded in for tickets to returnhis body to the United States. The funeral in Hong Kong had been for his family,friends and fans there, but because his happiest times had been in Seattle, hisfamily decided to bury him in peaceful Lake View Cemetery, where he used toenjoy walking alone in the rain.On 31 July, a small crowd of twenty people gathered outside the ButterworthFuneral Home on East Pine Street to watch colleagues and friends arrive forBruce’s funeral. But during the journey, the coffin had been damaged. This wastaken by some to be an omen that his soul was not at peace, and with all thecontroversy raging, it’s hard to see how it could have been. The new coffin wascovered with red, yellow and white flowers, making up the yin-yang sign he hadfirst adopted as an emblem for his gung fu institutes.The pallbearers were Robert Lee, Taky Kimura, Dan Inosanto, Steve McQueen, JamesCoburn and family friend and actor Peter Chin. As Bruce had wished, there was notraditional music. The music played was Frank Sinatra’s version of ‘My Way’, TomJones singing ‘The Impossible Dream’, Sergio Mendes’ ‘Look Around’, and theBlood, Sweat and Tears song, ‘And When I Die’. Though all of these songs havesince become clichéd cliché, and seem rather mawkish and sentimental, Bruce Leemore than most could at least claim to have lived life his way by attempting toachieve an almost impossible dream.Linda Lee spoke first: ‘He lived every day as a day of discovery. His thirty-twoyears were full of living. Bruce believed that the individual represents thewhole of mankind, whether he lives in the Orient or elsewhere. He believed thatman struggles to find a life outside himself, not realizing that the life heseeks is within him.’Taky Kimura said simply that Bruce had inspired good in others, while Ted Ashleyexpressed a more businesslike philosophy: ‘It could be viewed as a pity thatBruce passed on right at the beginning of his realization that he would make itbig. I have a sense of sadness mingled with the realization that, while he maynot have gotten up the ladder, he at least got his foot on it.’Finally, at the side of the grave, James Coburn made the last short speech:‘Farewell, my brother. It has been an honour to share this space and time withyou. As a friend and as a teacher, you have given to me and have brought myphysical, spiritual and psychological selves together. Thank you. May peace bewith you.’The coffin was lowered into the grave along with the pallbearers’ white gloves."},{"pageContent":" 24INQUESTOn 3 September, the inquest opened in Tsunwan, under the directorship of coronerEgbert Tung. At the start of the inquest, police barricades had been set up todeal with the crowds who came to get a glimpse of Betty Ting Pei, but once themedical testimony began, the crowds drifted away. The 23 July autopsy had foundtraces of cannabis in Bruce Lee’s stomach and the accompanying headlines nowsuggested he’d died a drug addict, while others suggested he’d needed drugs toaccomplish his extraordinary physical feats.The cannabis question had also become important because of the attendance at theinquest of David Yapp, of the American International Insurance Company. Thecompany had seen a possible way out of paying up on Bruce’s life insurancepolicy if it could be shown that Bruce had taken cannabis before he had filledout the application form and answered the question of whether he had ever usednarcotics with a ‘no’. Various tests for evidence of poisoning, made at therequest of detectives, all proved negative. The only further finding was thatBruce had taken the equivalent of one tablet of the aspirin compound Equagesic.Dr R. R. Lycette, the clinical pathologist at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, toldthe hearing that death could not have been caused by cannabis but was due tohypersensitivity to one or more of the ingredients of Equagesic. While thedoctor had found no injuries to the skull and no evidence of a brainhaemorrhage, Bruce’s brain had swollen very rapidly from its normal weight of1,400 grams to 1,575 grams.Ronald Teare, a professor of forensic medicine at the University of London, wasflown in as the inquest’s heavyweight. Over the course of thirty-five yearsTeare had supervised nearly 100,000 autopsies and provided evidence for almost20,000 inquests. The professor said that the presence of cannabis was a merecoincidence, adding that it would be both ‘irresponsible and irrational’ to saythat it might have triggered either the events of Bruce’s collapse on 10 May orhis death on 20 July. Although it was a rare and unusual case, he said, the onlyconclusion that could be reached was that death was caused by an acute cerebraloedema due to a reaction to compounds present in the prescription painkillerEquagesic.Bruce Lee’s doctor Charles Langford left Hong Kong in 1989 to head a medicalfaculty in Lafayette in his native Louisiana. Also a Baptist minister, he speaksin the measured tones of a Southern gentleman, recalling:Neither Dr Wu nor myself ever saw Bruce with cannabis, but he told us that heused to chew the root. He did say that it made time slow down for a littlewhile. I can see why it had appeal for Bruce; cannabis would induce a sense oftimelessness that might relieve some of the pressure from deadlines that he wasunder. Bruce was in touch with reality in every way; he had a very realisticself-view. He didn’t think that he was more than he was.Bruce Lee was a man of unusual ability, but the opportunities, his importanceand his fame all arrived in such a deluge that he literally didn’t have the timeto cope with it. From being a minor TV star he suddenly leaped to being thebiggest thing in the world. If he hadn’t had to deal with all the phoniness ofthat world, I think he could have coped. But what he was given to deal with wasmore than any mortal could have coped with. Even up until the time that I leftHong Kong, I would stop every day at my local newsstand and scan the covers ofthe papers and magazines. There wasn’t one single day when Bruce’s face wasn’ton at least one cover, even sixteen years after his death.The negative light in which the use of cannabis was viewed in Hong Kong can notbe overstated. It was seen as far worse than the use of heroin or opium. Thesituation between East and West is reversed. While the Chinese view opiumliberally, cannabis is considered a ‘foreign’ drug with sinister and evilovertones. Bruce’s father and even his wing chun master Yip Man were nostrangers to the opium pipe, but cannabis was associated with the‘hippie-tourist foreign devils’, and this view had a massive impact on theofficial findings.Dr Peter Wu’s recommendation to the coroner reflected this cultural and evenpolitical pressure that the cause of death was due to hypersensitivity toEquagesic or cannabis. As the cause of death wasn’t clear and cannabis waspresent, realistically, this possibility couldn’t be denied, but the officialverdict went on to name only Equagesic as the presumed cause.When first interviewed by me in 1992 at his clinic in Hong Kong, Dr Wu stillechoed his original opinion: ‘Professor Teare was a forensic scientistrecommended by Scotland Yard; he was brought in as the expert, so we can’tcontradict his testimony. The dosage of cannabis is neither precise norpredictable, but I’ve never known anyone to die simply from taking it.’Dr Don Langford reminds us of the further reason for the verdict that waseventually reached by the inquest:There was a great deal of concern because of Bruce’s life-insurance policy. Fora long time I believed that if I said anything the case might be reopened. Ieven took Bruce’s notes out of the file at the Baptist Hospital in case someonemight attempt to get to them. Cannabis has a known chemical alkaloid that canproduce seizures: it can be extracted and administered to produce that effect.Equagesic was not at all involved in Bruce’s first collapse. Thousands of peopletake Equagesic with no adverse effects, whereas people can be adversely affectedby cannabis. It doesn’t even need a hypersensitivity to it, simply exposure, andit’s impossible to determine the dosage. There’s not a question in my mind thatcannabis should have been named as the presumptive cause of death. I would liketo have seen a truer verdict rendered. But the whole world was watching thisinquest to see if a precedent would be set. If cannabis had been ruled as thecause of death it would have opened up a real can of worms, because no one hadever before said it had that potential. Hong Kong didn’t want to set thatprecedent, particularly in view of the fact that the coroner was a layman.The coroner Egbert Tung was a lawyer with no scientific background, and by allaccounts the inquest was something of a shambles and not without its comicmoments.Dr Langford adds:He would stop us and make us spell medical terms for him, which he would thenwrite out in long hand. It was ludicrous. . . . Does all this make Bruce Lee outto be some raving drug fiend? Of course not! He had the money and access toanything he wanted. Opium was more plentiful, and drugs would certainly have notbeen frowned on in entertainment circles. In my opinion, Bruce had simply takenpractical steps to seek out something that would alleviate a little of the greatpressure he was under.With the passage of time, both Dr Langford and Dr Wu now feel freer to expand ontheir earlier opinions.Don Langford states plainly:He was the fittest man I’ve ever seen. A headache tablet didn’t kill Bruce Lee.But he didn’t think there was anyone who knew what was best for him, excepthimself. The factors that caused his collapse in May are the same as those thatcaused his death in July. Bruce was affected by one or more of the alkaloids incannabis. The official verdict wasn’t so much a cover-up as an attempt toproduce a verdict that was more socially acceptable.Dr Wu echoes this:Bruce Lee could have died in May; he was in a very critical condition. It wassheer luck that there was someone there to help him. A lot of Nepalese hashishwas taken from his stomach. Not wanting to damage his health by smokingcannabis, he chose instead to eat it. Unfortunately, this overloads the bodywith the active ingredients far quicker than they can be processed. And his verylow percentage of body fat, along with all the stress he was under, made himeven more vulnerable to the drug and dramatically intensified its effects.We gave him a good talking to before we discharged him from the hospital [inMay] and told him not to eat the stuff again. Since he’d had such a bad reactionto it, we told him that if there was a next time the consequences might be evenmore severe. But I knew he wasn’t listening. He was convinced that he wasinvincible . . . immortal.By the end of the inquest on 24 September 1973, only a handful of reportersapproached Linda Lee for her comment on the verdict of ‘death by misadventure’.Once again, she could only ask them what difference it made.After being introduced to cannabis by Steve McQueen, Bruce Lee started using itwhile he was in Los Angeles, and both Joe Lewis and James Coburn witnessed it.Bob Wall says that Bruce was using it while filming Enter the Dragon and kept ajar of hash brownies on his desk to nibble between takes. Between 1971 and 1973Bruce’s weight had dropped from 145 to 122 pounds, due to a punishing exerciseregime and workload that resulted in his body fat content falling to theseemingly impossible figure of less than one per cent. On production stillstaken on the set of Enter the Dragon it is even possible to see the individualclusters of muscle fibre, particularly on his shoulders, arms and chest.On the film set, Bruce invited Ann Clouse, the director’s wife, to feel hisbiceps. ‘It was like feeling warm marble,’ she commented. She also recalls thatBruce told her he would be dead before his next birthday and wondered just howmuch more he could push his body.As an athlete, Bruce always drove himself higher, further and faster, buttowards the end he was trying to do so while chained to the heavy load ofstardom. Even if he’d had the opportunity, he never seemed to have theinclination to rest, just to try and ‘stop time’ for a while. Only once did heever speak on the subject of rest, saying he saw it as a not particularlydesirable state, but as somehow static, frozen and lifeless.Bob Wall explains, ‘He built himself. He took this skinny weakling body andturned it into something incredible. He put in hours of training, very intense,very complete. I don’t know what motivated him to do it.’Golden Harvest’s Russell Cawthorne adds, ‘I think the first impression you’d getfrom Bruce would be the incredible aura of energy that surrounded him, like anenergy field. In fact, he seemed much bigger than he was physically. You almostgot the impression that his feet never really touched the ground; he seemed tobe standing about six inches above it. It was quite a remarkable experience justmeeting him. The intensity you see in his films is just a watered-down versionof what he had in real life. Bruce always stays in my mind as someone ofincredible intensity, force and power, so motivated and so forward-driven you’dalmost believe he could fly!’Another Golden Harvest executive, Andre Morgan, remembers, ‘He spent a wholemorning doing one fight sequence, something like a dozen takes. We viewed therushes and the third, fourth and fifth takes were all good, yet he went on anddid a sixth, seventh and eighth, because all the time he didn’t feel comfortableabout them. As a person he was very intense. That was part of the problem. Hewas always going off in too many directions at once, to find out abouteverything as quickly as possible, always in a hurry.’Chinese medicine, philosophy, religion and martial art – every aspect of itstraditional culture – recognizes that there are channels through which lifeenergy flows. This energy, chi, is not secondary to life but is fundamental toexistence. The flow of chi is the very basis of life itself, as if our bodiesand our personalities themselves are formed from its condensed ripples andpatterns. These channels extend far beyond everyday physical reality; they movenot only within the nervous system and the psychological realm, but ultimatelythroughout everything that exists.Occasionally someone with a phenomenal concentration of will power, emotionalintensity or physical determination strives to go beyond the normal uses of thebody and mind, and beyond normal human needs. Such a person begins to open him-or herself up to these greater, more universal energies. This can happen throughintense creative or physical effort done with great motivation or intent. Todifferent degrees, this process can be seen in the lives of many of the greatcomposers, writers and artists, as well as in the lives of spiritual masters andpowerful dictators.But some people may get to the point where this energy overwhelms them and theycannot channel it any more. For example, the painter Vincent van Gogh attemptedto transfer onto his canvas the intense world that blazed before his eyes beforeit all became too much for him. There is a Greek myth that describes thissituation: Prometheus steals the fire of the gods from heaven to bring back toearth, but ends up being consumed by the flames.So did Bruce Lee simply burn out? Did the ‘unlimited expression of his being’,which Bruce found in his martial art, implode? Was the boy who could ‘never sitstill’ not able to handle what was happening in his body as it came underincreasing pressure? Was it simply pushed beyond the limits?To use Western terminology for a moment: Bruce Lee was able to channel thearchetypal energies that exist beyond the energy bound up in the everydaypersonality structure. He succeeded in accessing extraordinary or evensupernatural levels of energy in a process that has been described in other waysby many different traditions.For example, in tribal cultures a shaman is someone who is skilled in moving indimensions of reality outside of the norm. The medicine men of the PlainsIndians would use various disciplines, rituals and meditations to carry out‘vision quests’ to acquire knowledge and power. In a similar way, the Chinesewarrior priests found that lessons and techniques in martial arts could betransferred from the depth of the unconscious – even though this might later bedescribed as a meeting with the spirit of a power animal, such as a tiger or acrane, or as some other supernatural force or being . . . maybe even a demon ordragon.We can now appreciate the significance of that fateful night in Bruce’s roomabove Ruby Chow’s restaurant – his encounter with the archetypal energies thatare the basis of human life – when, at the age of nineteen, he did battle with adark force and came face to face with energy from the depths of the collectiveunconscious. The result of this encounter was that he became more motivated anddriven, and it was this force that drove him to his great achievements, and onto the limits of what is humanly possible.We get a taste of this energy when we watch Bruce on film, receiving a kind ofsecondary charge from him that has a curiously uplifting quality. Fred Weintraubrecounts a telling incident at the premiere of Enter the Dragon, when a friendof his was so charged up by the end of the film that he told his wife to driveback alone to Beverly Hills because he wanted to run back.Given the overload of pressure and phenomenal outpouring of energy in the lasttwo years of Bruce’s life, something had to give. There was the sheer physicaleffort of fighting in stupefying heat and humidity, doing take after take whilewriting and directing at the same time, as well as constantly turning overthoughts about what direction he should take next, and the strain created by hisinstant celebrity and constant intrusions into his personal life.Too many people looked at Bruce and saw only dollar signs. While he tried to gowith what was happening to him, it was all too much, too fast. Not only had hestopped training, in the end he’d stopped laughing, too.James Coburn, says ‘Wherever we were, he had to be at the centre of attention.He was always demonstrating his ability to control people, and when he wasn’t incontrol, he left. But that still point, that still point in the middle of theaction, I don’t think he ever found that.’Taky Kimura recalls, ‘Just after his collapse, Bruce called me from LA and said,“You never write, you never call me.” I said, “I’m enjoying what you’re doing,you don’t need me.” He replied, “If I can help you, Taky . . . You’re still mynumber one friend and don’t you forget that. Let me know what you need. Anythingyou want. I haven’t changed. I’m still the same guy.” He never forgot that I’dhelped him out in the past and that I never asked for anything. He told me tosend the old plane ticket that he’d given me – to go to Hong Kong to start workon Game of Death – and he’d replace it.’Taky may have been happy to see Bruce doing well, but he was wrong when he saidBruce didn’t need him. At the end, what Bruce Lee needed wasn’t a wife whosupported but didn’t challenge him. Nor did he need people who looked at him andsaw only money, or fans who looked at him and saw a superman. What he reallyneeded was an old teacher like Yip Man, or a genuine friend like James Coburn orTaky Kimura. He needed someone, anyone, who could have helped him to reconcileit all.The last time Bruce spoke to Yip Man, he asked him: ‘Do you still regard me asyour student?’Yip Man’s response was to ask Bruce, ‘Do you still regard me as your teacher?’They laughed, but the silence that followed spoke for itself.In the end, Bruce isolated himself through his own fierce autonomy. And insteadof being full of ‘the love of life and the power of all things’, he succeeded inhis ambition to become a totally self-made man. . . . But one who had nowhereleft to turn but to his creator. It turned out that behind the dazzlingbrilliance of his creation he was just as human as we are. He shared ourvanities and flaws, just as we all share his unrealized potential.The ‘what if?’ questions will never go away, and his unrealized potential willforever be the footnote to the legend and the icon. Of course Bruce had bigpersonal ambitions, more than the occasional ulterior motive, and ambivalentgoals. At the end of his life, Bruce was trying to reconcile the two mostopposite human pursuits: the preoccupations of Hollywood, celebrity and wealthwith the disciplines found in a Taoist monastery. Put bluntly, there are notmany gold Rolls Royces parked outside the Shaolin temple.It’s almost as if Bruce had trained and dedicated himself for twenty years tobecome the ultimate screen hero for just one film. Enter the Dragon took Bruceto within touching distance of the seemingly impossible statement where heaffirmed that he would become the first genuine international Chinese star andmake $10 million in ten years.Bruce’s finger may have been pointing to the moon and all its heavenly glory,but he had also taken to wearing a full-length mink coat and enough aftershaveto bring down a swarm of tsetse flies. And in the end, the master of unarmedcombat had taken to carrying an illegal handgun whenever he left his house inKowloon Tong.How could he possibly have carried on writing, choreographing, directing andstarring in films, training as consistently and intensively as he needed to,eating the right foods, flying around the world to meetings to set up new deals,endorse new products, appear in ads, do interviews, promote films . . . andstill spend time with his family? Something had to give, and it did. The fittestman in the world, it seems, had one weak spot.The hyperactive child, the dancer, the innovative teacher, the philosopher, thestar, the fiercely autonomous individual, the prophet of kung fu – these wereall roles that Bruce Lee was forced to carry, sometimes simultaneously, by hisown sense of destiny. At its climax, this destiny saw intense discipline andunique ability being worked out on the world stage for millions. In the end, theultimate impossibility of this combination of energies is probably what killedhim.And if it did, then Bruce Lee died the death his whole life had been preparinghim for: a death that went beyond the limits of identity.If you always put limits on yourself and what you can do, physical or anything,you might as well be dead. It will spread into your work, your morality, yourentire being. There are not limits, only plateaux. But you must not stay there,you must go beyond them. If it kills you, it kills you.Bruce Lee"},{"pageContent":" 25RUMOURS AND LIESPredictably, the inquest did nothing to quell the rumours that sprang upimmediately after Bruce’s death and which become ever more extravagant year onyear.It’s true that there were probably many people with whom Bruce Lee had nopersonal connection who wished him dead. There were suggestions that Bruce hadbeen murdered by members of the Triads he had crossed or offended, or that heperished at the hands of Japanese martial artists who were tired of hisdismissive attitude towards karate. Others suggested that kung fu masters hadkilled Bruce with a secret death-touch technique because he had exploited theart and, in his dealings with Hollywood, brought the martial arts intodisrepute.Kung fu fanzines looked in desperation for any angle on which to hang a story.Astrologers were hired to say why everyone should have seen it coming and tospeculate on what Bruce would have done had he lived. Some even believed thatBruce was not dead at all and had retreated to the mountains ready to make amessianic reappearance at a later date.The theories became ever more outlandish, including one that Bruce had died fromhaving his sweat glands removed so that he’d look good on camera. The Chinesewhispers spread until, months later, Golden Harvest’s Andre Morgan received aletter from a woman in Goose Bay, Labrador, saying that her family had just seenone of Bruce’s films and understood that he was now dead. She asked GoldenHarvest to confirm the rumour that the mafia had shot Bruce because he was toobig to control any more.Much was also made of the signs and omens surrounding Bruce’s death. JournalistMel Tobias observed that Kowloon, where Bruce’s house was situated, means NineDragon Pond, and speculated that the big dragons did not like having a LittleDragon in their midst, so devoured him, while another Chinese superstition hasit that one should never put the word ‘death’ in the title of a book or film.Bruce Lee’s friends and colleagues have all expressed their opinions about hisdeath. Doug Palmer wrote:His broadmindedness made him impervious to any restrictions, whether on martialarts techniques or the conventions surrounding them. He was the first to teachgung fu to non-Chinese, at a time when he risked criticism and even ostracismfrom the Chinese community. Ultimately, coupled with the jealousies of hisoverwhelming skill and popularity, was the effect of his impatience (some calledit arrogance) with those who relied on cant and tradition instead of merit andability. All this, I believe, led to his death.In August 1972, Bruce appeared on Hong Kong’s TVB channel, as part of a benefitwhich raised over $5 million on behalf of the victims of a recent typhoon.Several masters from other schools were on the show. The mutual dislike betweenhim and some of the more-traditional masters in Hong Kong had grown as fast asBruce’s reputation. At any rate, one of the other masters was bragging about hisinner power, goading Bruce and challenging him to strike him in the stomach. Themaster stood in the ready stance, one arm at his side and the other pointing athis stomach, insisting that Bruce hit him there, adding that it was impossibleto hurt him. Bruce approached and struck him on the nose. The master jumped backstartled, then incensed, and demanded to know what Bruce was doing. ‘It’s easyto defend, if you dictate how you are going to be attacked,’ said Bruce. ‘Anyonecan learn to resist a blow if he is prepared for it. A gung fu man must beprepared for the unexpected.’The last time I saw Bruce was while he was filming Game of Death. Sure he wasthin, but he was very fit. I don’t believe that he was working himself to death.Bruce made many enemies in Hong Kong for openly flouting tradition and causingloss of face – that TV show was seen by three million people. Nobody couldopenly challenge Bruce; no one could beat him one-to-one: so the only way to getrid of him, without leaving any evidence, would be to poison him.Another of Bruce’s early students, James DeMile, was so convinced that foul playwas involved in Bruce’s death that he mounted his own investigation. DeMile’sfirst suspicion was also that the Chinese wing chun clans were unhappy aboutBruce westernizing the art. In Hong Kong people took up a fighting style as partof a deeply ingrained family tradition. Unless you are privy to that traditionit is difficult to understand the depth of feeling involved, just as it is hardfor some cultures to comprehend that in Europe violent deaths occur as a resultof rivalry between fans of competing soccer teams.Later DeMile revised his thinking, saying that he believed Bruce had beenpoisoned by people he’d antagonized in the Hong Kong film industry, becauseBruce’s independent attitude had made too many waves in an exploitative industrythat had previously run like clockwork.In Bruce Lee, King of Kung Fu, Felix Dennis wrote:Bruce Lee destroyed face like a leprous aftershave. To many of those beaten byLee, in business or in the ring, his superman self-confidence was unbearable,his blunt candidness an insult. Then again, Lee cost many of his rivals largeamounts of money. Besides siphoning off much audience support from theestablished studios, there were numerous complaints that, under competition fromthe Lee films, smaller production companies floundered and were squeezed out ofthe race.Lee irrevocably altered not only the products of the Mandarin film industry, butalso the structure of the industry itself. As the first Mandarin actor to takecontrol of his own career, he showed the way to a more equitable share of theprofits for his fellow performers. Certainly, in Hong Kong, in the early monthsof 1973, there were many people who would have been more than happy to bringdown the curtain on the meteoric rise of Lee’s star.Alex Ben Block, then the entertainment editor of the Miami News, wrote TheLegend of Bruce Lee. Despite the fact that Block had no experience at all of themartial arts, it is mainly from this book that all the tales of clandestineassassination squads and jealous kung fu masters arose. Block made manysuggestions: Bruce Lee was murdered by those who hadn’t wanted kung fu madepublic, by people jealous of his fame, or by those angry that he wouldn’tendorse their products. Block leaves it for us to decide whether theassassination itself was done by ‘one talented enemy with the knowledge and thewill’, ‘by ninja poisoners using cannabis’, by Malaysian martial artists using a‘vibrating palm’ technique, or by Shaolin monks who were upset with Bruce andused the delayed death-touch known as dim mak. This was the technique Bruce hadfirst seen demonstrated by the praying-mantis master Gin Foon Mark in New York;it works as a kind of reverse acupuncture, to disrupt energy and to harm, ratherthan to balance and to heal.The wild speculation in Block’s book was soon being quoted as authoritative,well-researched fact. While Popster magazine promised to reveal that Bruce waskilled by unknown assassins using a secret death-touch, on the following page itattempted to answer the rather more basic question, ‘What is Kung Fu?’Alex Ben Block, former editor of the Hollywood Reporter, now says, ‘Have Irevised any of my opinions? To a certain extent I have, though personally, Ialways believed Bruce Lee died of natural causes. I wrote that book in a matterof weeks, when nobody really knew what was happening, so I just threw outeverything I could that might offer some explanation. I don’t, for example,believe any of that stuff that Goldman wrote in Penthouse.’Ben Block is referring to the two-part article by Albert Goldman which appearedin the January and February 1983 issues of Penthouse. In this article Goldmanasserts that Bruce Lee showed all the classic signs of the cowardly bully,calling him an overrated showbiz brat, a fortune-cookie philosopher and acontrol freak who’d become addicted to a powerful Nepalese hash resin whicheventually killed him. Goldman’s thesis was concocted from two phoneconversations, one with Bob Wall and one with Bruce’s doctor, Charles ‘Don’Langford.‘Goldman talked to me once on the phone,’ says Bob Wall, ‘then misquotedeverything I’d said from the most negative point of view.’Don Langford also recalls the Goldman article in which he is ‘quoted’ as callingBruce a hysteric and in which Bruce supposedly presented both Dr Langford andhis colleague Dr Peter Wu with a sample of cannabis while exclaiminghysterically, ‘It’s the only thing that stops time!’Langford recalls, ‘My first contact with the Lee family was when Brandon wasbrought to me because he’d injured his hand when he trapped it in a foldingchair. I didn’t know who Bruce was; I simply remembered Brandon’s father asbeing a muscular and intelligent man. Then a nurse said to me, “Don’t you knowwho that is?” When I realized that the family lived nearby I started to noticeBruce jogging every morning. After that, I treated Bruce whenever he’d beeninjured on the set.‘That article caused me some embarrassment. I remember with some disappointmentthat Albert Goldman’s data was incorrect. Bruce was certainly made to look likeless than he really was. Bruce was theatrical rather than hysterical; he was adramatic person, an actor, and he used to act out the events of his injuries.Bruce and I even talked about it; he said that when he was acting he became thepart, and I guess that was what he was doing when he was in the surgery. But hewas always in control. I think Goldman’s account was over-dramatized.’Albert Goldman also wrote similarly cynical biographies of Elvis Presley andJohn Lennon. As with his treatment of their lives, his account of Bruce Lee’slife reveals less about its subject than it does about the writer’s own uglypsyche. In Goldman’s world, Bruce Lee worked out with ‘grimy punch bags’ and‘bizarre dummies’. Goldman was even capable of imbuing martial arts trainingwith a sleazy atmosphere. The writer appeared quite literally to hate his work,despising those popular heroes he wrote about while resenting having to feed offtheir achievement to make his own living. Behind Goldman’s portrait of Bruce Lee– and the loaded questions and misquotes – one can always sense the writer’sheartless, unfulfilled self. Just as the truth is that foul play did not killBruce Lee, so Goldman’s brand of foul play has always been a failed attempt tokill the truth. When the writer died later on a transatlantic flight, no onecould be found who was willing to take responsibility for his body or pay thefuneral expenses: a fitting legacy.Bruce’s younger brother Robert has always said that he believes Bruce died as aresult of foul play, and there are always interviews on Bruce Lee websites tothat effect. Robert adds that the Lee family is united in these beliefs, but by‘the Lee family’, Robert means himself and Bruce’s other siblings, who havenever been on the best of terms with Linda’s side of the family. While theirantipathy falls short of an outright feud or open hostility, it would be fair tosay that not many Christmas cards are exchanged. Robert cites Bruce’s rapidweight loss prior to his death as significant, saying that ‘other factors’ wereinvolved and adding that when the time is right the details will be made public– though 34 years and counting seems like a long time to wait for the time to beright.We must also take into account the material presented by Tom Bleecker, LindaLee’s second husband, in his book, Unsettled Matters (1999), which he wroteafter their divorce. Bleecker states plainly that at the time of his death Brucewas not ‘the world’s fittest man’ and was gravely ill from abusing his body. Hisbaldest assertion is that Bruce’s dramatic mood changes and physical conditioncame about from using anabolic steroids, which Bleecker says he probably beganusing in the late Sixties.There is absolutely no evidence to this effect, other than Bleecker’s owntestimony, and nobody else anywhere has repeated or endorsed his claim. At thetime in question steroid use wasn’t illegal, so this isn’t the issue. The main‘evidence’ that Bleecker presents is Bruce’s sometimes alarming mood swings, butthey were always evident and a manifestation of his driven and, at times,impatient perfectionism. The fact is that during the last two years of his lifeBruce lost weight at an astonishing rate. Linda Lee has never commented on anyof Bleecker’s assertions, but it’s certainly possible that some of Bleecker’smaterial may be fallout from his failed partnership with Linda.Bleecker says, ‘The issue of Lee’s steroid use is complex, but the main thing Iwanted to get across was that steroids damaged Bruce physically and emotionally.Like so many athletes who have used them, Bruce paid a heavy price. I know thatthere will be those who’ll scream and yell that never in a million years wouldBruce use steroids. He still had to do the workouts – it’s not that he wascheating – but it does explain a lot of his erratic behaviour. I felt it wasimportant to give a credible explanation of many of Lee’s violent outbursts, andthese had more to do with “roid rage” than any stresses of the business, ordisplays of his natural personality.’One such violent outburst was the ‘Lo Wei incident’, when the director claimsthat Bruce pulled a knife and threatened him. In a later search no knife wasfound, but Bleecker claims that Linda told him she quietly removed the knifefrom the screening room.The final bomb that Bleecker drops concerns Bruce’s extramarital affairs: ‘BruceLee was well known for cheating on his wife, both before and during theirmarriage. It’s also well known to those close to him that his marriage washeading for the divorce court and many have said that Linda was greatly relievedwhen Bruce died.’The respected author Davis Miller has endorsed this view in interviews for hisproposed book The Last Days of Bruce Lee – as yet unpublished – in which he saysBruce had been having sexual relationships with women, including some of hisleading ladies, as far back as 1967, adding, ‘In Hong Kong, he was much more ofa tomcat.’Hedging his bets, Tom Bleecker believes that Bruce had a massive adrenal failuredue either to steroid or drug abuse . . . or that he was poisoned.There are bound to be many theories about the premature death of one of theworld’s fittest men, but since Bruce had suffered a serious brain trauma onlytwo months before he died, this weakness was evident. Whether it had beenpresent from birth or had been brought about by injury should be the first pointto consider. At the coroner’s inquiry, Raymond Chow testified that during thecourse of making his films, Bruce had taken many blows that were not included inthe scripts, and Chow added that some of these accidental blows had been quitesevere.In truth, the greatest element of foul play surrounding Bruce Lee’s death seemsto be people’s willingness to exploit the circumstances of it. In the end, mostof the confusion and conjecture stem from Raymond Chow’s attempts to cover upthe true events.Thereafter, a bewildered and defensive Betty Ting Pei was left to face the pressalone. She made things worse by lying, claiming, ‘On the night he died I was notat home. I had gone out with my mother. I last saw him several months ago, whenwe met by chance in the street.’ But journalists who spoke to Betty’s neighboursfound out that Bruce had been a regular visitor to her apartment for monthsprior to his death.Betty stayed away from Bruce’s funeral, and when questioned about theirrelationship she spoke evasively, implying that they had a special friendship.‘Silence is the best answer to scandalous rumours,’ she protested. ‘Because Itreasure his friendship, I put up with the gossip.’ The actress then threatenedto sue the press if they persisted with stories of an affair. ‘It seems peoplewant me to die,’ she told The Star. ‘Bruce is dead. Why don’t you just leave itat that?’ One paper retorted with the headline: ‘BETTY TING, SUE US!’ andprinted a fresh list of disclosures as the besieged actress went into hiding.The best witness to these particular events is Felix Dennis, who was one of thevery first to speak to Betty after Bruce’s death. According to Dennis, Bettytold him that she and Bruce had been having an affair, and their friends openlyconfirmed that it had been going on for about a year. At one point Bruce hadattempted to end the affair, resuming it only after Betty broke down and wasadmitted to hospital. The general feeling was that Bruce was not as worldly asBetty when it came to sex and that he’d been getting a bit of an education.‘She’s a revelation with her cleverness,’ Bruce had told friends shortly afterhe and Betty met.It seems it was never ‘true love’ but whatever the case, the relationship wasobviously more than a brief or casual fling.As for Betty’s delay in calling an ambulance, again one can’t underestimate therole that ‘loss of face’ plays in Chinese culture. There can’t be many worsescenarios than having the dying husband of another woman in your apartment.Felix Dennis adds, ‘Although Betty initially admitted that she and Bruce hadbeen having an affair, she later changed her account because she felt‘responsible’. If Betty had picked up the phone the moment Bruce collapsed, hemight have been saved, but she panicked, hoping he would recover, then waitedtoo long before calling Raymond Chow, who was on the other side of Hong Kong. Bythe time Chow had fought through the traffic it was too late. Bruce wasn’t deadon arrival at hospital, but the doctors were astonished that he’d lasted as longas he had.’"},{"pageContent":" 26AFTERWORDSIn the weeks after Bruce Lee’s death, as grief and controversy raged across theworld, Bruce crossed the line between being the film industry’s hottest propertyand becoming an icon. The Bruce Lee cult had arrived and fans began flocking toshowings of the B-feature Marlowe, which had flopped when first released but wasreissued immediately with Bruce given top billing.A month after Bruce’s death, Enter the Dragon was released. In London itmonopolized three West End cinemas for five weeks before becoming a selloutthroughout Britain, Europe and the US. Although reviews in the West thought thatBruce Lee had played in little more than a James Bond pastiche, in the end thefilm worked to his advantage, as it is his appearance alone that lifts Enter theDragon out of the ordinary, making it the genre’s greatest movie.The finished version of the film is significantly different from the originaldrafts, and Bruce was successful in using the film as a vehicle for expressingelements of his culture, rather than just another action movie. Based on acost-to-profit ratio, it is also the most successful film ever made. In 2004, itwas deemed ‘culturally significant’ and selected for preservation in the USNational Film Registry. Enter the Dragon could have been just the beginning forBruce Lee, and even though it wasn’t, it is nevertheless a fitting legacy.Bruce Lee lived an extraordinary life: he bridged cultures, revolutionized themartial arts, taught a fierce philosophy of individualism, remade the image ofthe Asian man in the West and, in the process, became unforgettable. Few livesin modern times have provided so much to study and reflect on, yet few liveshave been so obscured by fantasy and B-movie-grade tack.In 1975, the Shaw Brothers’ film Bruce Lee and I showed Betty Ting Pei rompingsemi-nude while ‘Bruce’ clutches his head in agony. After Bruce’s death, Bettytells a barman she is forced to leave town because of the hate directed at herfrom his fans, then the barman beats up some thugs and tells them to respectBruce’s memory. Though if respect for Bruce’s memory were the issue, the filmwould never have been made. Not only did Betty get a writer’s fee, she alsopersuaded Run Run Shaw to shell out $20,000 for twenty dresses – ten times asmuch as Shaw had originally offered Bruce to star in one of his pictures. In thelight of this, it’s hard to believe that this is the same woman who protested,‘I didn’t gain anything because of him, be it in name or profit. Each day Iconfined myself to my room, blaming myself, cursing myself, my feelings numb.’After making this film for Shaw, Betty Ting Pei made more bad films, married awealthy Taiwanese businessman, ran two clothes shops, bought a Mercedes sportscar similar to Bruce’s, divorced, then became a nightclub singer and avegetarian.Almost twenty years later, in 1993, Universal released its Bruce Lee biopicDragon: The Bruce Lee Story. The director, Rob Cohen, bought the option forLinda Lee’s biography, written with second husband Tom Bleecker, and threw thescript together in three weeks flat. Cohen was certainly accurate when he saidthat he was doing a ‘fictional version of a non-fiction story – neither a truestory nor a documentary’, because it bears no resemblance whatsoever to hisactual life.The story of Dragon centres on a highly romanticized account of Bruce andLinda’s relationship. Not only does it take far too much latitude with thecharacters, it stretches artistic licence to breaking point. To list theabsurdities and errors in the story would fill an entire book, and in a specialsupplement printed in June 1994, Martial Arts Illustrated magazine did exactlythat.Dragon was a commercial success, but unlike Betty Ting Pei’s film, and thecountless exaggerated biopics that emerged from Hong Kong in the 1970s, it isdifficult to excuse such lazy exploitation from mainstream Hollywood.Contemporary films on the lives of Malcolm X, Jim Morrison, Tina Turner andGeronimo all use some artistic licence, but even so they treat their subjectswith a great deal more accuracy and respect. Bruce Lee deserved far better.Fortunately Bruce Lee’s work is more significant and still hugely popular, so itwill outlive all the exploitative dross, as his own films are discovered anew byeach succeeding generation.After Bruce’s death, Linda and the children returned to Seattle beforeeventually moving to the upmarket Rolling Hills Estate, south of Los Angeles.However, Brandon had trouble adapting to life in America and became angry andwithdrawn for a while. His heritage meant that he was constantly challenged atevery school he attended, and he spent time at nearly every school in the SouthBay area. Unsurprisingly, he rebelled against his image as Bruce’s son andstrived for his own identity, getting involved in teenage crimes, joyriding in astolen car and once even impersonating a driving test examiner. He spent acouple of years on the road exploring the West Coast, and four months beforegraduation he was expelled from college. Finally, when he was fifteen, Brandonspent a year training with Dan Inosanto and Ted Wong.Brandon recalls, ‘I had a bit of a love-hate relationship with the martial arts.There was a year where I was very involved, then a period where I said, “Hey, Idon’t have to do this.” About the only constant throughout that period wasacting. My dad never told me to get into acting, and neither did my mother, buteven as a little boy, it’s all I wanted to do. I never thought about anythingelse.’In the 1980s, Brandon moved to Boston to study acting at Emerson College, withthe aim of becoming an actor who could do realistic fighting, rather thanbecoming a martial artist who could act. However, his name opened no doors andhe was working as a script reader when a casting agent finally got him his debutin Kung Fu, a movie spin-off from the TV series. Further roles did notmaterialize, and like Bruce, Brandon broke into films in Hong Kong, where hemade a low-budget film called Legacy of Rage followed by Laser Mission, whichwas made in Germany. He made his first US feature, Showdown in Little Tokyo,with Dolph Lundgren in 1991.Inevitably Brandon’s work was compared with his father’s, and for a short timeit looked as if Brandon might be his father’s heir on screen too.‘In a perfect world, I’d rather that comparisons to my dad didn’t happen,’Brandon says, ‘but I’m lucky; he’s somebody that people admire a lot. I’ve met alot of people who’ve been really positively affected by his film work, peoplewho say, “It changed my life after I saw one of your dad’s films.” So long aspeople are respectful about my dad, I try to be respectful to them as well.’Brandon’s second feature, the martial arts action movie Rapid Fire, showed hewas more willing to embrace his heritage. While the film’s props master listedfifty-six guns, in a weapons count that ran to six typed pages, there is noshortage of hand-to-hand fights choreographed by Brandon and Jeff Imada, whom hemet at Dan Inosanto’s academy.Like his father, Brandon was also given to showing off and tearing downMulholland Drive, not in a Porsche, but on his motorcycle. Comparing Brandonwith his father, producer Robert Lawrence said, ‘His father had a burningintensity; Brandon is more fun. He’s freewheeling, hip and moretongue-in-cheek.’ Little did anyone know that Brandon was soon to share hisfather’s tragic fate.Filming of a new movie, The Crow, began in Wilmington, North Carolina, onBrandon’s twenty-eighth birthday, 1 February 1993. The story is of a murderedrock star who returns in the form of a crow to exact retribution. From the verystart the set was plagued by mishaps and the crew began to speak openly aboutthe ‘curse of The Crow’.On the first day of shooting a carpenter had to be hospitalized with burns overninety per cent of his body after his crane ran foul of a live power cable; aconstruction worker slipped and drove a screwdriver through his hand; adisgruntled set sculptor went berserk and drove a car through the props room,destroying it, and on 13 March, a storm wrecked most of the set.In the early hours of 1 April 1993, I received a phone call from a friend in LosAngeles who was helping me set up an interview with Brandon. Instead of news ofthe proposed meeting, the message was that Brandon Lee had just been killed onthe film set. TV news bulletins soon confirmed the astonishing news that BrandonLee was dead.Just before the incident that resulted in his death, Brandon expressed hisconcern that the crew were so tired. Shortly after midnight on 31 March, theyhad just finished another gruelling day. The next scene to be filmed wasBrandon’s death scene, in which he was to be shot, with special effects used tosimulate the bullets hitting him. As the cameras turned, a fellow actor fifteenfeet away fired blanks from a Magnum 44 and Brandon slumped to the ground. Soconvincing was his performance that the crew broke into spontaneous applause,then, slowly, onlookers realized the true situation. Brandon was rushed toWilmington Medical Center where doctors gave him fourteen pints of blood andfought for twelve hours to save him. Just as she had done twenty years earlier,Linda Lee heard herself requesting an autopsy.Later the cause of death was established: the dummy bullet that had been loadedfor the close-up scene had become lodged in the gun. Subsequently a blank chargeused to simulate gunfire had shot the fake bullet with enough force to cause thetragedy. Just as happened immediately after Bruce’s death, the tabloids had afield day. Early stories told of Brandon being killed by yakuza (Japanese mafia)assassins or jealous lovers. It was even speculated that he had been killed bythe same black demon that had pursued his father. On 3 April Brandon was buriedin Lake View Cemetery, alongside his father.In May 1994 The Crow went on general release where it went straight to numberone at the box office. Though the external baggage that went with the film mayhave drawn some curiosity seekers, the completed film avoids being exploitative,but this doesn’t make the death scene any easier to watch. Brandon receivedwidespread acclaim for his performance, with Rolling Stone’s Peter Traversdescribing Brandon’s acting as having a probing intelligence and passionateheart. He added, ‘Lee is sensational on all counts in a final performance thatbrims over with athleticism and ardour.’In LA Weekly, Manohla Dargis wrote, ‘If Brandon Lee hadn’t died, it’s likelythat The Crow would have been a great movie; as it is, it’s implausibly great.Inevitably, Lee will be folded into the same history as his father, Bruce. ButBrandon Lee deserves to be remembered for himself.’Although Bruce will always be the unparalleled genius of martial arts on screen,Brandon had become a confident, compelling and convincing actor and martialartist in his own right. His father would have been very proud of him. Brandon’senduring memory of his father was of a hard-working man: ‘He always impressedupon me that there isn’t an endless amount of time. I’ve always remembered hiswords and try, consciously, not to waste any time.’ His words seem all the morepoignant now.Immediately after Bruce’s death the house at 41 Cumberland Road, Hong Kong,became the focus for his many ‘disciples’. Fans who today make the pilgrimage tothe house he named ‘The Crane’s Nest’ will be disappointed to find that it isbeing used as a ‘romantic hotel’. Rooms with TVs showing round-the-clock porncan be rented by the hour, with condoms discreetly provided in the bedsidecabinet. Thankfully the hotel doesn’t use Bruce’s name to promote itself, thoughmost people are aware that he lived there. The house has been used as a brothelfor many years and was already being used in this way when I first visited HongKong in the 1980s, when it was called the Kam Wah Gardens. Most of the luxurioushomes in the area are no longer private houses, but brothels, children’snurseries, wedding chapels, retirement homes and funeral parlours. It might evenbe possible to be hatched, matched and dispatched without ever leavingCumberland Road.Today Bruce Lee still attracts fans who fail to see the irony of belonging to aclub that has the motto, ‘Towards Personal Liberation’. It’s not unlike the fansof The Prisoner TV series who fail to see the contradiction in joining a clubdevoted to a character whose tag line was, ‘I am not a number: I am a free man!’Bearing in mind that the word fan is also the root of the word fantasy, what dowe make of the following members of the geek kune do fraternity unearthed byDavis Miller in his excellent book The Tao of Bruce Lee?Mike Miyazaki is the kung fu pyjama-wearing son of a Japanese businessman whoused his father’s wealth to turn his apartment into the set of Enter the Dragon,where TV sets playing non-stop Bruce Lee movies were mounted in the ceiling andwalls. An American, Blade Leong, claimed to be a reincarnation of Bruce Leebecause they shared the same initials – no mention was made of Buzz Lightyear.Leong’s unfortunate wife was made to wear Linda Lee shift dresses, circa 1960,and sculpt her hair into a beehive. Dalton Lee claimed to be the love child ofBruce Lee and Lindsay ‘Bionic Woman’ Wagner. He moved to the motel near LakeView Cemetery in Seattle, where Bruce is buried, and proceeded to mail videos ofhimself performing various action routines to the long-suffering Linda Lee.Linda’s attorney, Adrian Marshall, sent notice that under no circumstances washe to approach her or the children. One confused individual from Idaho named hisson Brandon, his daughters Shannon and Lisa Marie, and changed his own name toJesus Lee Presley.In London in the late Seventies, a young man who realized what the initials ofthe movie Game of Death spelled out, hijacked a bus and rammed a shop frontwhile screaming, ‘I’m Bruce Lee, I’m God.’ And in 1986, on 20 July, Betty TingPei gave birth to a son on the thirteenth anniversary of Bruce Lee’s death. MsTing Pei informed friends that she was the proud mother of (yet another)reincarnation. On the twentieth anniversary of Bruce’s death in 1993, a retiredMongolian doctor, Ichinorov Dendrev, undertook a nine-month pilgrimage in whichhe and two other gentlemen made an unsuccessful attempt to walk from Mongolia,by way of Siberia and Alaska, to place a bunch of flowers on the grave inSeattle.There is a history of ill feeling between Linda Lee and Bruce’s siblings, but on28 April 1993, the family kept the peace for long enough to gather and celebrateBruce being awarded a star on Hollywood Boulevard’s Walk of Fame. Linda, Dragondirector Rob Cohen and Mayor Bradley spoke before the assembled guests at a VIPdinner, followed on 7 August by Linda’s auction of Bruce’s possessions, whichshe had lent for the filming of Dragon – adding the only note of authenticity inthe film. Bruce’s Hong Kong driver’s licence fetched $7,200. His Kato cap andbraces went for $8,600 – only a little short of what he netted for the entireGreen Hornet series. By far the biggest money-spinner was Bruce’s writtenaffirmation ‘My Definite Chief Aim’, in which he vowed to achieve world fame asthe highest-paid Chinese superstar by making $10 million between 1970 and 1980.This item, handwritten on a single sheet of paper, was bought for the PlanetHollywood restaurant for $29,000.One afternoon in July 2003, close to the thirtieth anniversary of Bruce’s death,I was passing a shop on the Strand in London, which sells memorabilia andautographs. I went inside and began talking to the owner. I asked him whosesignature was worth most these days, and he replied that the Beatles were alwaysgood value, or the three astronauts who went to the moon, but that anything withBruce Lee’s signature on it started at about £5,000. At the time of writingBruce’s signed Green Hornet contract was being advertised for $30,000.Also at the time of writing, a $25 million theme park is planned to open atBruce’s ancestral home in Shunde, a town of canals and bamboo gardens northwestof Hong Kong, the bucolic area that Bruce’s grandfather left in the latenineteenth century. Betty Ting Pei and Bruce’s younger brother Robert attendedthe ceremony to lay the foundation stone. London’s Sunday Times reported thatthe park will be patrolled by Bruce Lee ‘mannequin robots’, radio-controlledfrom inside a giant statue of the late film star, and that a rollercoaster willmake his signature screams and grunts. Officials named a street in Hong Kongafter Lee and turned a tea shop into a museum, packed with letters andphotographs of uncertain provenance, to which Betty Ting donated a set of‘nunchucks’ [sic]. They are also discussing plans for a memorial hall and amonorail to connect the town centre with the theme park. However, all this maybe brought to a halt by Shannon Lee, the actor’s only surviving child, who plansto visit Shunde in 2008 ‘to find out what else they are dreaming up over there’.After a sketchy career as an actress and singer, Shannon and her lawyer husband,Ian Keasler, now control the Lee estate. Shannon has her own plans, whichinclude a television series that will use computer graphics to recreate herfather. ‘The technology is nearly here to make it look as if he’s back,’ she’sreported to have said. She has also authorized a Broadway musical of Bruce’slife and hopes to work with the Chinese government, which is in discussion withthe BBC to make a documentary about Bruce. Meanwhile, Robert Lee is preparinghis own cinematic version of the much-filmed Bruce Lee story, which may yet leadto a direct confrontation with Shannon.After thirty years, no human has yet been able to emulate Bruce Lee’s screenperformances, so producers are turning to technology to do the job. A movieprovisionally titled Dragon Warrior, which will take three to four years to makewith a budget of $50 million, will recreate Bruce Lee using computer-generatedimagery and voice-simulation technology. The movie’s mastermind, Chul Shin, headof the Korean-based Shincine Films, has promised both A-list supporting actorsand an A-list director. ‘We chose this film as our first international project,’says Shin, ‘because we have the resources and the technology to make it work.There is no figure who commands more respect and excitement than Bruce Lee, whois included in Time magazine’s list of The 100 Most Influential People of the20th Century’ – an accolade that puts him alongside the like of CharlesLindbergh, Muhammad Ali, Marilyn Monroe, the Kennedys and the Beatles. For theirpart, Linda and Shannon Lee agreed to the project because ‘we believe inShincine and Mr Shin’s enthusiasm and commitment to making a first-rate film’.On 30 August 2002, Universal’s games division launched an action-adventure game,Bruce Lee: Quest of the Dragon, ‘inspired by the legendary martial artist’ forMicrosoft’s X-boxTM video game system. The game’s storyline sticks closely tothe intended theme of Game of Death, where Bruce Lee would have had to completeseven levels in order to finish the ‘game’. In the video game Bruce has tobattle multiple opponents in order to rescue his kidnapped father and retrieve amystical golden relic that holds the secret to all the martial arts. It hardlyneeds to be said that actual martial arts training will get you a little closerto this secret than playing a video game ever will.Players have to perfect a variety of martial arts styles, including some ofBruce Lee’s signature jeet kune do moves, as they travel through the levels.Over a hundred moves were ‘motion captured’ with the help of one of Bruce Lee’slast students, Jerry Poteet. The game is set not in a pagoda, but in variouslocations from Hong Kong to San Francisco and spans not seven, but thirty levelsof opponents. According to Universal Interactive president Jim Wilson, the gamematches Bruce Lee for speed, featuring ‘lightning-fast play at blistering framerates and is the experience Lee fans have long been waiting for’.Bruce Lee’s image has appeared on postage stamps in China, as well as in Gambia,Madagascar and many other African countries. Asian Time magazine placed him on alist of heroes who have helped Asia rise ‘from poverty to powerhouse’. There areplans for a Broadway musical and, as a prelude to the 2008 Beijing OlympicGames, a forty-part TV biography The Legend of Bruce Lee, with a $6.5 millionbudget is scheduled. Had he still been alive perhaps – as Muhammad Ali did inAtlanta – Bruce would have been lighting the Olympic flame in Beijing.There have been many dubious tributes and accolades to Bruce Lee’s memory overthe years, but Bruce himself would have been touched by recognition from hischildhood hero, China’s first martial arts screen actor, Master Kwan.When journalist Bey Logan asked Master Kwan what he thought of Lee LittleDragon, Master Kwan walked off towards his inner sanctum. Even though he was inhis eighties, he still had a clear gaze and walked with a straight posture. Whenhe returned he had a book on Chinese movies in which both he and Bruce appeared.‘Maybe you can get this book in the library,’ he said, modestly acknowledgingthe recognition they shared.Bruce Lee expressed regret that after he died people would probably hangpictures of him in their schools and bow to him. One Ohio karate instructor wentone better than this: he claimed he had a pair of Bruce Lee’s old trainers thathe would bring out and hold up in front of the class. The students duly bowed tothe shoes, while the teacher talked about their aura and the chi the studentswould absorb from them.For their part, Linda Lee and biographer John Little present Bruce in a somewhatsanitized and sanctified light; but the Bruce Lee Fan Club of India goesconsiderably further by attempting to deify ‘Him’ as a bona fide messiah to beworshipped and adored.Davis Miller writes:In music certainly, there can be life. But there’s death in music, too. Thatplaintive stuff you hear as fat-ass congregations of white folks singsorrowfully, obligingly, of Christ bringing them alive. Maybe Jesus hadsomething going. But Christ, how can any sane person take anyone’s followersseriously?Most relevant and touching is the simple tribute of Shanlon Wu, aChinese-American who grew up in suburban New York in the 1960s. He had no Asianheroes to use as role models until he saw his first Bruce Lee movie. Hedescribed his subsequent experience of dawning self-awareness in a 1990 articlefor the New York Times:I was born in 1959, an Asian-American in Westchester County, NY. During mychildhood there were no Asian sports stars. On television I can recall only thatmost pathetic of Asian characters, Hop Sing, the Cartwright family houseboy onBonanza. But in my adolescence there was Bruce.I was fourteen years old when I first saw Enter the Dragon, the granddaddy ofall martial arts movies. Between the ages of fourteen and seventeen, I saw Enterthe Dragon twenty-two times before I stopped counting. During those years, Icollected Bruce Lee posters, putting them up at all angles in my bedroom. I tookup the Chinese martial arts and spent hours comparing my physique with his. Ilearned all I could about Bruce.My parents, who immigrated to America and had become professors at HunterCollege, tolerated my behavior, but seemed puzzled at my admiration of ‘anentertainer’. My father jokingly tried to compare my obsession with Bruce to hisboyhood worship of Chinese folk-tale heroes. But my father’s heroes could not bemine; they came from an ancient literary tradition.After college, I competed as an amateur boxer in an attempt to find myself-image in the ring. It didn’t work. My fighting was only an attempt to copyBruce’s movies. What I needed was instruction on how to live. I quit boxingafter a year and went to law school.One grey morning, many years later, Shanlon Wu visited Bruce Lee’s grave:The headstone is red granite with a small picture etched into it. The picture isvery Hollywood – Bruce wears dark glasses – and I think the calligraphy looks abit sloppy. Two tourists stop but leave quickly after glancing at me. I realizeI am crying. Bruce’s grave seems so small compared to his place in my boyhood;so small in comparison to my need for heroes. Seeing his grave, I understand howlarge the hole in my life has been, and how desperately I’d sought to fill it.I had sought an Asian hero to emulate. But none of my choices quite fitted me.Their lives were defined through heroic tasks – they had villains to defeat andbattles to fight – while my life seemed merely a struggle to define myself. Butnow I see that the very struggle has defined me. I must be my own hero even as Ilearn to treasure those who have gone before. Their lives beckon like fireflieson a moonless night, and I know that they, like me, may have been flawed. Still,their lives were real. They were not houseboys on Bonanza."},{"pageContent":" LEGACY"},{"pageContent":" 27QUITE A HEROWhen I look around I always learn something and that is to be yourself always,express yourself and have faith in yourself. Do not go out and look for asuccessful personality and duplicate it. Now that seems to be the prevalentthing happening in Hong Kong, like they always copy mannerisms but they neverstart from the root of being and ask, ‘How can I be me?’Bruce LeeDespite this hopeful advice, Bruce Lee made such an impact on the film industry,then left such a vacuum that, in the East, a multitude of imitators appeared.Bruce Le, several Bruce Lis, Bruce Leong, Bruce Rhe and Myron Bruce Lee; not tomention Tarzen Li and Tarzen Lee, Kowloon Li and Hong Kong Lee, Rocky Lee, JetLee, Bronson Lee, Dragon Lee, Conan Lee, Clint Lee and even one Gypsy Lee. Thosefew who didn’t actually change their names were usually billed as ‘the new BruceLee’. Dozens of films worked the name of Bruce Lee into their titles and useddeceptive promotional material, while other films used every possiblecombination of ‘Fist’, ‘Fury’, ‘Game’, ‘Dragon’ and ‘Enter’ in their titles.There was even a sci-fi-plotted film that involved clones of Bruce Lee.For any good kung fu movie there were a hundred with bad plots, bad acting andbad production, all with titles like Kung Fu Exorcist, Kung Fu Zombie and evenKung Fu-ry. When the honeymoon with kung fu was over, there was a brief flurryof ninja films, depicting the exploits of the black-hooded martial artistspresented as a hybrid of Spiderman and James Bond, equipped with all kinds ofweapons and gadgets.In the West the history of martial arts movies is very simple: there is no‘before Bruce Lee’. Only two Western actors have forged careers as martial artsheroes, but although Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude van Damme have enjoyedsuccessful film careers they are less convincing as martial artists than thosewho are generally considered to be Bruce Lee’s true heirs.By coincidence, Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung, two of the best martial arts actorsto emerge since Bruce’s death, both made early cameo appearances alongsideBruce. Having previously acted together in the Peking Opera, both men worked onEnter the Dragon. At the beginning of the movie, Sammo Hung appears as BruceLee’s sparring opponent, while Jackie Chan appears briefly in a couple ofscenes, first as one of Oharra’s henchmen and later on when he gets his necksnapped by Bruce during a battle with several guards.Born in 1954, Jackie Chan spent his youth in a Peking Opera school where hestudied gymnastics, acrobatics and martial arts. Like Bruce, he was also a childmovie actor. As a stuntman Chan appeared in Fist of Fury and Enter the Dragon,before Lo Wei – who was looking for a new Bruce Lee to net him further millions– cast him in the 1976 movie unimaginatively titled New Fist of Fury.Inevitably, Lo Wei billed Jackie Chan as ‘the new Bruce Lee’ for eight movies,until Chan discovered and developed his own screen personality, with a fightingstyle that owes as much to Buster Keaton as it does to Bruce Lee.Chan’s real success began when he started to write his own scripts for filmslike the slick action-filled comedies Armour of God and Police Story. ThoughJackie Chan’s fights have an element of slapstick to them, there is also asatisfying level of skill. He works closely with a regular team of highlytrained stuntmen to create an immaculately choreographed and slickly editedblend of comedy, fighting and stunt work. Chan, who insists on doing all his ownstunts, has nearly killed himself three times, once in a fall of over fortyfeet, which was broken only by a single sheet of canvas. The audience’sknowledge that Chan is risking his life is what brings them to see his films,and each one features an epilogue of out-takes, showing the stunts that wentwrong, with Chan limping away, wincing in agony.Sammo Hung, or Hong Jinbao as he was known then, was born in Hong Kong in 1952.Both of his parents worked in the local film industry, and guardianship wasthrust upon his grandparents. Hong joined the Opera Academy in 1959 after hisgrandparents heard about the school from their friends. As one of the SevenLittle Fortunes performing group, he established a school rivalry with one ofthe younger students, Yuen Lo, who later became Jackie Chan. Hong departed theAcademy after an injury left him bedridden for an extended period, during whichtime his weight ballooned. He eventually returned to work in the film industryas a stuntman and was given the name Sam Mo after a portly Chinese cartooncharacter. He later anglicized this to Sammo Hung.With Warriors Two (1978) and The Prodigal Son (1981), Hung made two movies thatare considered to contain the best examples of wing chun on film. In 1988, hestarred in Alex Law’s Painted Faces, a dramatic retelling of his experiences atthe Peking Opera School, where students were made to perform hundreds ofacrobatic back flips and hours of handstands against a wall. Despite some of themore brutal exercises and physical punishments shown, Hung and Chan consider themovie a toned-down version of their own experiences.Hung became one of the pivotal figures to spearhead the Hong Kong new-wave filmmovement of the 1980s, which helped reinvent the martial arts genre. He is bestknown in the West for his starring role in the US television series Martial Law,in which he reportedly recites his English dialogue phonetically.Mention should also be made of Tony Jaa, who was born in Thailand in 1976 andgrew up in a rural area where he saw films by Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan and Jet Liat temple fairs. While doing chores or playing with friends, he would imitatethe martial arts moves he had seen in the films. ‘I practised until I could dothe move exactly as I’d seen the masters do it,’ he told Time magazine in 2004.Tony Jaa has become best known for his breathtaking stunts and mesmerizingfighting techniques in the art of muay thai. He too initially worked as astuntman, and even doubled for Sammo Hung when the actor made a commercial foran energy drink that required him to grasp an elephant’s tusks and somersaultonto its back.Jaa’s work eventually led to his breakthrough role as a leading man in the filmOng-Bak (2003), where he does all his own stunts without mechanical assistanceor computer-generated effects in a style of extreme acrobatics and speedydance-like moves. This film led to him being hailed as Asia’s next martial-artsfilm superstar. As Jaa gained popularity, his films captured the attention ofhis hero, Jackie Chan, who asked his director to cast Jaa in one of his films,Rush Hour 3, though this role never materialized.A second development in post-Bruce Lee martial arts’ cinema harks back to theold ‘unrealistic’ style of film featuring the kind of impossible feats Brucehimself would have watched as a boy, although now at least they were accompaniedby strong storylines and extremely high production values. These epic films usea lot of sophisticated aerial ‘wire work’ or computer-generated imagery and haveas much in common with myth and fairy tale as martial art.In the Matrix series of films, directed by the Wachowski brothers and begun in1999, the hero has martial arts abilities downloaded directly into his nervoussystem. It’s an impressive movie that owes everything to the brilliance of itscutting-edge special effects, for which it won an Academy Award. The filmsdepict a complex science fiction story incorporating many elements, includingcyberpunk, mythology, Hong Kong action films and virtual reality. Severalphilosophical concepts are also explored, including Hinduism, Christianity,Gnosticism and Buddhism, along with the concept of artificial intelligenceoverthrowing or enslaving mankind, a theme that’s previously been touched uponin many science fiction stories.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) is a wuxia (chivalric martial arts) filmdirected by Ang Lee and featuring an international cast of Chinese actors,including Chow Yun Fat, Michelle Yeoh, Zhang Ziyi and Chang Chen. Made on a mereUS$15 million budget with dialogue in Mandarin, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragonbecame a surprise international success and won the Academy Award for BestForeign Language Film as well as being nominated for Best Picture and winningfour other Academy Awards. The fantasy aspect of the film comes into playwhenever the main characters fight: they possess seemingly magical powers,soaring through the air as they vault across roofs, running up walls and movingwith superhuman ease. These powers are never clearly explained in the movie, butthe implication is that they come from the training and secret knowledge of theWudang school of martial arts. The film’s enigmatic ending hints that, under theright conditions, one might even acquire the ability to fly.Told in flashbacks – and even flashbacks within flashbacks – Hero (2002) isanother wuxia film, starring Jet Li as the nameless leading character. Inspiredby acclaim for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, it failed to achieve the samesuccess, due in part to overseas criticism of its perceived pro-Chinesecommunist subtext.Kill Bill by writer-director Quentin Tarantino was originally conceived as onefilm but released in two separate volumes (2003 and 2004) due to its runningtime of approximately four hours. The movie is an ambitious epic-length revengedrama, told with extensive use of flashbacks and flash-forwards, which nod inthe direction of film genres such as Hong Kong martial arts movies and Italianspaghetti Westerns, accompanied by much use of popular-music and pop-culturereferences and deliberately over-the-top bloodletting, not to mention dialoguelifted from Fist of Fury. Notably, Uma Thurman stars in a Game of Death-styleyellow and black catsuit.House of Flying Daggers (2004) is a wuxia film that’s more of a love story thana martial arts film, and the use of strong colours is a signature of thedirector Zhang Yimou: several scenes in a bamboo forest completely fill thescreen with green. Near the end of the movie, there’s a fight scene in ablizzard, with the actors set against a completely white background, whileanother scene uses bright yellow as its colour theme. The costumes, props anddecorations are taken from Chinese paintings of the period to add authenticityto the look of the film, making it a visually stunning film. Chinese critics,however, have carped that Zhang was simply trying to appeal to Western audienceswith heavily choreographed fight scenes and extensive use of computer-generatedimagery.In real life the best martial artists do not always make the best filmperformers, and vice versa. The very qualities that make a good fighter make apoor screen fighter. Speed, the ability to hide emotions, disguising the effectof blows received and not telegraphing moves all have to be reversed so thataudiences can see what is happening.Bruce Lee set modern screen fighting standards with his many innovations,technical mastery, inventive choreography, dramatic pauses and humour, and theseinnovations successfully spawned a further form of martial art. While Bruceoften said that acting was his career and martial arts his real love, for a fewglorious moments his ambition and his vocation became one and the same thing.Bruce Lee was unique as a screen fighter because he was the first and best‘real’ fighter any of us saw. My own kung fu teacher Derek Jones told me how, asa young boy, he would sit through every showing of Enter the Dragon, remainingin the cinema all day, watching the film on rotation, because each time he sawit he would learn something new. These repeated viewings in no way diminishedBruce’s abilities, but served to enhance them. Nobody ever sat through repeatedshowings of Roger Moore or John Wayne: John Wayne was big and slow and wonfights only because it said so in the script, while the exploits portrayed inthe Bond films were little more than escapist schoolboy fun.The most recent generation of martial arts films owes everything to contemporaryfilmmaking technology, but to see Bruce Lee on film is to see a human bodybrought to a level of supreme ability through a combination of almost uniquetalent allied to a lifetime of hard work. Bruce was blessed with abilities and ascreen presence that few have enjoyed, but he became imprisoned by his ownsuccess and the need to be what everyone wanted him to be. There is no doubtthat the typhoon of super-celebrity affected him deeply, and having suddenlyachieved almost all his ambitions, he was faced with the question of what to donext.Bruce guessed right when he said that that kung fu films would enjoy mass appealfor only a few years. Fred Weintraub had already explained that too muchphilosophy in his films wouldn’t appeal to the mainstream, and he was alsobeginning to suspect that he might not be able to maintain the level of physicalperformance needed. Yet still he couldn’t resist the urge to forge ahead. Brucerefused to step back, rest and recharge himself. At the same time there wereother pressing decisions over career direction. Would he play roles outside ofthe martial arts? Would he consider parts that showed some vulnerability ordenied his athletic abilities? Would working with better-quality scripts andactors, directing or doing non-martial art dramatic roles, have been thechallenge he needed? Might such roles reveal that his acting was too unrealisticfor Western audiences?Brandon Lee believed his father would have met these challenges:When I see his films, I can see that he acted sincerely. He put over what hereally felt, neither more nor less. When he was filming, I remember that henever overacted to make an effect, it would have rung false. He was a veryintense man and that’s why he only did what he believed he had to do. Hisperformances were a pure expression of something he had deep within himself. Henever tried to portray something he didn’t feel, and even less to imitatesomeone else. I hate that bunch of Chinese actors who try to act like my fatherdid. He was naturally great. If he had lived, I am sure he would have made otherfilms, without restricting himself to kung fu films. In any case, he would havemade other films.Honestly, you have to admit that, apart from Enter the Dragon, the others arenot particularly good films. I mean by that that the stories were very poor. Theactors couldn’t act and even Enter the Dragon was, all in all, let us say arather simple film. Were it not for his presence these productions would nothave made a cent, they would be nothing today. My father would certainly havemade films that could stand on their own, by the story and by their acting. Theproblem is my father disappeared at the moment when he could have done greatthings.Like everyone, I was real respectful towards my dad. He was quite a hero, but hewasn’t superhuman, just a guy.Like a handful of others, Bruce Lee has become larger in death than he was inlife. James Dean represents the restlessness and rebellion of youth. Monroe isHollywood’s goddess. Despite everything, Elvis will always be the king of rockand roll. John Lennon epitomizes the optimism and freewheeling ideas of theSixties. All have become icons: fantasy images or symbols of an ideal. All areunique. And just as Anna Nicole Smith was no Marilyn and Liam Gallagher is noJohn Lennon, so there will never be another Bruce Lee.All of this was summed up perfectly in the telling reply that followed whensomeone was once asked, ‘Who is the next Bruce Lee?’‘Why?’ came the response, ‘wasn’t the first one good enough for you?’"},{"pageContent":" 28ROOTS . . .A comprehensive list of all the martial arts in the world would be several pageslong, while a description of each of them would fill an entire library. Amongthe many fighting systems evolved by different cultures – Japanese, Chinese,Korean, Filipino, Brazilian and so on – there’s an almost endless variety in thetechniques used. But there are also broad similarities between these arts and anumber of ways of categorizing them: such as internal or external, hard or soft,striking or grappling, hand-to-hand, weapons-based and so on. Of course, allsystems will include one or more of these elements. For example: boxing isprincipally a striking art, but it involves grappling when boxers hold eachother to smother their opponent. Wing chun has both blocking and striking at thesame time. Wrestling and judo are grappling styles, but there can be strikes,and so on. Beneath all of these ways of analysing the fighting arts, however,there are core principles, what Bruce Lee called ‘the roots of combat’.The foundation of Bruce’s martial art was the Shaolin ‘master martial art’ thatevolved into wing chun and became the root of jeet kune do. The most vitalaspect of this art derived from the practice known as chi sao – usuallytranslated in the West as ‘sticking hands’ – a practice that initially trainsthe ‘contact reflex’ through which physical contact with the opponent’s limbsallows one to sense the right moves and act spontaneously and instinctively.Sticking hands practice develops a kinesthetic awareness – what Bruce Lee called‘body feel’ – that far outstrips our normal perception. Usually, we perceivewhat is happening around us mainly through our eyes, coupled with the process ofrecognition in the brain, both of which are interconnected through the sameneurological circuits. An impression perceived through touch doesn’t travelthrough the same neural circuitry as a visual impression; it travels through thesame circuits that control physical movement. In this way, the martial artistlearns that the best way of recognizing and responding to attack is directly,through physical sensation, rather than through the eyes and thoughts. Theseeing-recognizing-calculating-acting process is far too slow and complicated tobe of any use in physical confrontation. As Bruce Lee put it, ‘From the eye tothe hand, how much time is lost?’ Developing kinesthetic awareness through thecontact reflex is vital to an efficient response when being confronted orattacked.At first this ability is developed slowly and methodically. To develop ‘musclememory’ using simple preset moves involves all the possible combinations ofarm-to-arm contact that can be made between two people. From practising thesepredetermined moves, I am eventually able to deal with random interaction.It’s not difficult to see the similarity between the way the musician begins bylearning chords and scales before he can improvise, and the way the novicedriver learns the various skills of driving before she can drive and hold aconversation at the same time. The learning process allows you to progress askill from the thinking function to the instinctive function. Sticking handspractice was the foundation and cornerstone of Bruce Lee’s martial art, makingit impossible for his ordinary thought processes to dictate his movements. Or ashe put it, ‘I don’t hit. It hits!’As his character explains in Enter the Dragon, ‘When the opponent expands, Icontract, and when he contracts, I expand. And when there is an opportunity, Ido not hit, it hits all by itself.’The actions of the contact reflex can be seen in those that expand on contactand those that contract. To repeat an earlier example: this is what happens whenI ride a bicycle. When I push my foot down (expand) on the right pedal, I haveto simultaneously release (contract) the pressure on the left pedal, and viceversa, to allow the cranks to turn, otherwise there is no forward movement.In a combat situation, if you feel your opponent withdraw his arm – by sensing adecrease in the pressure or intent coming from it – this automatically sendsyour arm out to strike him or her. Conversely, if the opponent presses in onyou, the increased pressure again automatically triggers the technique todissolve or deflect this excess force. This principle doesn’t only apply to kungfu, there is a similar maxim in judo: ‘Push when pulled, pull when pushed’. Inaikido, it translates to ‘Turn when pushed, enter when pulled.’ In judo theresponse is linear, while in aikido it’s circular, but the intention is exactlythe same.Whatever happens, I can stay one step ahead of the opponent. In the children’s’game of stone, scissors and paper, if my opponent gives me paper, then I cut itwith scissors. If my opponent gives me a stone, then I wrap it in paper. And ifhe gives me scissors, then I jam them with a stone, and so on. There is no rightor wrong, I simply allow my opponent to dictate my moves, as he strikes(expands) or pulls away (contracts). As this process further refines itself, Ican begin to sense subtle shifts in my opponent’s emotional state, his level ofcommitment, or even ‘read’ his thoughts and intention without making physicalcontact.As a young man, Bruce Lee wrote:The important thing is not to attempt to control the attack by resisting it withforce, either physical or mental, but rather to control it by going with it andnot asserting oneself against nature. This is simply based on the harmoniousinterchanging of the theory of yin [contraction] and yang [expansion]. As longas we plan our actions, we are still using strength and will not be able to feelour opponent’s movements, thus failing to comprehend the true application of yinand yang. In view of this, the two practitioners are actually two halves of onewhole.. . . When you understand the root, then you understand all of its blossoming.Bruce Lee’s martial art concept of jeet kune do is the blossom on a tree thathas very deep roots. Far too many people try to explain Bruce by looking at thealmost limitless ability he possessed at the height of his powers, but it simplyisn’t possible to understand Bruce’s genius as a martial artist without lookingat how he got there.Bruce’s unique skills and abilities were rooted in his mother art of wing chun.Wing chun principles, structure and energy are present in everything he didsubsequently. Bruce Lee spent five years rooting himself in wing chun beforeallowing any branches to develop, and only then, once he had understood andembodied the principles of one martial art, was he able to understand andincorporate the principles of other martial arts.By the time Bruce arrived in the US and began teaching his art, its principleshad already become part of him. He didn’t simply know what he was doing, he hadbecome it. Bruce said that only martial artists who were already experienced andwell grounded in their own disciplines could learn from him. That’s why DanInosanto, with his Filipino martial art, and karate champion Joe Lewis were bothable to benefit from what Bruce had to offer. Bruce inspired them to greaterlevels of performance, achieving similar standards but from differentfoundations.It’s sheer folly for anyone to think that he can begin from the almost limitlessfreedom that Bruce Lee took his entire lifetime to realize. Trying to grafttogether cuttings from several traditions without having a solid, stable rootwould be futile and pointless. You must begin with some form of martial art,before you can grow into having no particular or fixed form. You can’t justbegin with no form at all. This is what Bruce means by his insistence onrecognizing the difference between having ‘no form’ (no rigid or dogmatic form)and ‘having no form’ (being without any form at all).As Jhoon Rhee said, ‘It was possible to show Bruce Lee a move once and he woulddo it as if he had mastered it for years.’ Bruce’s understanding of coreprinciples was a touchstone that allowed him later to integrate aspects of everymartial art he ever encountered. And it seems that he achieved this ability soearly that he may well have been blessed with it from the very beginning.Bruce Lee synthesized many arts – Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Filipino – aswell as Western techniques such as fencing and boxing, into one seamless,homogenous, fundamental understanding. In essence, this was a completely newconceptual approach to the subject: jeet kune do.‘The mastery of any art transcends the art,’ said Bruce Lee. Because of thisprinciple we can make connections between a martial art and any other art. Likean artist creating a landscape by choosing forms and mixing colours, the martialartist can choose from a palette of kick, punch, block, advance and retreat,creating any strategy under the sun. It is only a matter of knowing how to blendthe components.If Bruce had taught music instead of martial arts, he would not have been ableoffer much to the classical musician who could only play music by reading from ascore, but he could have helped those who wanted to improvise their ownfree-flowing style. Whether it was jazz, blues or reggae, they would all beworking with the same twelve notes and laws of harmony, no matter how far thoselaws were pushed to their limits.Using what Bruce called ‘the three stages of cultivation’ we can further comparelearning a martial art with learning a musical instrument. The first stage – the‘primitive’ or ‘innocent’ stage – is like learning basic scales and chords,which have no meaning on their own but are necessary building blocks. The secondstage – ‘sophistication’ – means learning to play ‘licks’, copying phrases fromother musicians or favourite records and stringing things together. The thirdstage – ‘artlessness’ or ‘spontaneity’ – is when you realize you have avocabulary. From words to sentences you progress to expressing yourself inparagraphs or even poetry. You can make up your own solos around the chords thatare given to you. You can write, play an instrument or fight without having tothink about it.Wayne Hawkins, a JKD instructor and the musician responsible for the music trackon the documentary A Warrior’s Journey, adds, ‘I think the mindset of a jazzmusician is very much like that of a JKD practitioner.’ ‘If people had four armsand four legs,’ said Bruce Lee, ‘then there would be a different kind of martialart.’ And there would also be a different kind of music.Bruce Lee’s intentions have often been misunderstood by members of the mixedmartial arts community who believe that he was accumulating every possibletechnique he could, as if to create an ‘ultimate fighting’ arsenal. But a goodmartial artist doesn’t set out to compile an encyclopedia of techniques any morethan a good musician does. To make a further analogy: would the ultimatemusician be one who learned every jazz and blues lick, classical piece and poptune he could, along with the folk music of Kazakhstan, and then tried cobblethem together into one unholy fusion? Of course not. Both musicians and martialartists learn techniques, but ultimately this is done in order to identify theunderlying principles of their art, such as harmony in music or pressure inmartial art. Then, once a certain level of proficiency is reached, they caninteract with others, as the spirit moves them.Bruce once likened his approach to that of a sculptor. Some sculptors, he said,create their work by adding one bit of clay to another and building it up untilthey’ve accumulated what they want. But Bruce’s approach was more like that ofthe sculptor who starts with a formless piece of stone, from which he chips awayeverything that’s not needed until he’s left with the essentials and with whatworks. Far from gathering the many flowers on its branches, Bruce was far moreconcerned with getting down to the underlying energetic root principles of themartial arts tree.Bruce Lee’s critics have made much of the fact that he never fought incompetition and chose to have people like Chuck Norris and Joe Lewis as hisunofficial representatives. One of the most vocal of these critics has been JoeLewis himself, who on various occasions has said:Angelo Dundee [Muhammad Ali’s trainer] never fought, but he understood thescience of fighting. And Robert De Niro looks good in Raging Bull – he throwssome good-looking punches. I must’ve heard Bruce say a thousand times, ‘Youcan’t swim without getting in the water, Joe.’ But here’s a guy who nevercompeted. We never really saw him get in the water.Bruce had two agendas: one, to get in movies by working with big name directors,producers, writers and actors, and two, to build up his stature as an instructorby working with world champs like myself, Mike Stone and Chuck Norris. That wasa smart move ’cos it paid off.Were his skills as good as they’ve been written? No. But he hit really hard forsomeone of his size. I tried on numerous occasions to get Bruce to spar with me,but he never would. We did strictly limited drills. I believe he had the speedand power to become a world-class boxer, but the real questions were neveranswered. I’ve never stood in front of another human being who was as quick ashim. And he not only had speed, he had the inner confidence to use it. He waslike Ali. And I’ve stood before both of those men, so I know. On the plus side,Bruce was fast and he was coordinated and he moved very well on his feet. On theother side, he had a long, skinny neck, which means he wouldn’t be able to takea big punch. Back in the mid Sixties, his kicks were a little weak and hesometimes over-lunged.But asking how good Bruce Lee might have been in competition is like asking howgood Mike Tyson might be as an actor. Enter the Dragon is the highest-grossingfilm in history. That’s an accolade good enough to last ten lifetimes. Don’t tryand make him more immortal than he already is! He’s a leading candidate for thegreatest martial artist of all time, but that still doesn’t make him a greatfighter, just like being a great fighter doesn’t automatically make me a greatactor.Ed Parker also believes that in a street fight Joe Lewis would have been toomuch for Bruce to handle, but others feel differently, and one of them is JamesdeMile:I decided to show him what the reality of street fighting was, but he stopped mecold and tied me up, so that he could hit me at will and I could do nothingabout it. I’ve read some of Joe Lewis’s comments but I know Bruce would haveblown him away, or anyone else for that matter who acquired their reputation byplaying tournaments. Bruce was the best fighter I’ve ever known, not pound forpound, but against anyone.Bruce accomplished his fighting skills in the first few years, then began toexplore the martial arts as an art. People assumed that he changed because hewent on to explore many different concepts and techniques, yet I didn’t seeanything that was better than what he did in the beginning. He just didn’t teachpeople everything he knew.Jim Kelly was once asked who he considered to be the greatest tournamentfighter, and he replied, ‘I would dearly love to say Bruce Lee, but I can’tbecause he never fought in competition. I’ve heard tales about martial artistshe sparred against and there are people who aren’t telling everything they knowabout his ability. There’s a code of silence protecting their friends and theirreputations and egos. It’s not that they were no good; it’s just that Bruce wasincredible. I would stake my life on Bruce doing extremely well in competition.In fact, I doubt there was anyone in the world that could have beaten him.’Ernest Lieb, a fifth dan karate black belt who won forty-two tournaments, didn’tconsider himself a match for Bruce. Another top karate man, Ken Knudson, saidthat when Bruce side-kicked him he felt as if his eyeballs were left where he’dbeen standing. Fred Wren, one of the top ten karate practitioners in the US whenBruce was alive, says that he never met anyone with more fighting knowledge andability than Bruce. Louis Delgado, who once beat Chuck Norris in the GrandChampionship, maintains that Bruce Lee baffled him totally, adding, ‘I wascompletely in awe when I fought him.’ When asked who would win a real fightbetween Bruce and himself, Chuck Norris commented, ‘Why Bruce, of course, nobodycould beat him.’Though some consider Bruce a middle-class tough guy rather than a hard-corefighter, Dan Inosanto did see him fight on the streets of Hong Kong. ‘We’retalking street fights,’ he says. ‘I’ve seen him in what I don’t even callfights. I’ve seen guys who wanted to break his bones, but they couldn’t do it,so it turned into a lesson. They found out that he could just literally play.’Dan Inosanto adds two telling comments, firstly, ‘A match in the ring is not afight’ – even Muhammad Ali once said that in a real street fight he wouldn’tgive much for his chances – and secondly ‘Does a woman have to enter a beautycompetition to be beautiful?’It is thanks to Bruce Lee bringing kung fu to the West that, in recent years,monks from the Shaolin Temple have toured both America and Europe with a stageshow. And it’s because of this that the person who I believe is carrying onBruce Lee’s true martial arts legacy is now in the West.While on the first ever Shaolin Temple Monks tour of the US in 1992, athirty-fourth-generation monk called Shi Yan Ming defected to the West. On thelast date of the tour in San Francisco, in the middle of the night, he slippedout of his hotel and escaped to the new world. Unable to speak English, hesomehow managed to make his way to New York, where he hid out in a basement withonly bread and cereal to eat, while the newspapers and TV announced that aShaolin monk had escaped.The rebellious monk eventually founded the US Shaolin Temple in New York andcurrently teaches authentic Shaolin martial arts and Chan (Zen) Buddhism. LikeBruce Lee, who rebelled against the traditionalists to teach kung in the West,so Shi Yan Ming has angered authorities in China. And just as happened withBruce, students have flocked to him, including many celebrities from the worldof music and film. Although Shi has embraced Western culture, married andfathered two children, there is no mistaking his ability, integrity andauthenticity. On his website, Shi Yan Ming’s story begins with the words,‘Before there are branches, there are roots.’ While it ends, ‘Believe inyourself, trust yourself and you will find all the answers to all yourquestions.’ Bruce Lee couldn’t have put it any better himself."},{"pageContent":" 29. . . AND BLOSSOMSThirty years ago, the explosion of interest in martial arts in the West wasbrought about almost single-handedly by Bruce Lee through his starring roles andiconic status as the world’s first and best martial arts action star. Hisathleticism was a unique blend of Western physicality and Eastern fightingprinciples, which redefined the genre of action movies and the martial artsthemselves for the modern era.As a movie martial artist, Bruce Lee invented a new vocabulary. Rather thanusing methods that harked back to the Chinese theatrical tradition or theover-the-top action sequences that were standard fare, Bruce insisted on long,well-choreographed fight scenes played out in real time. His film work set newstandards: no longer could fight scenes rely on a few lumbering haymakers,trampolines or slick editing.As an innovative teacher, Bruce Lee defied his culture and fought with his owncountrymen in order to reveal the Chinese fighting arts to people in the West.After breaking with tradition, rather than sticking with one particular martialart, he aspired to learn everything he could about every method of combat fromevery teacher he met or sought out. Through a natural genius for martial arts hetranscended stale tradition and divisive styles to set martial arts on anentirely new footing.Driven to become the best that he could be, he collected techniques andinformation and met as many great martial artists as he could. At the same timehe sought out cutting-edge methods of body conditioning, exercise and diet, alsoembracing the Western ideal of increasing his power in whatever way possible.Because Bruce Lee never fought in open competition we have no way of knowing howgood he might have been as a martial sportsman. Although there is a lot ofanecdotal evidence about Bruce’s street fights, or the way he dealt withchallenges from young guns on his films sets, we have no way of measuring hisabilities against any of his supposed equals – Joe Lewis for example. Yet evenwithout actually taking part in competition, Bruce Lee was the trailblazer forthe modern hybrid fighters who compete in what has become known as ‘mixedmartial arts’.Within his first year of training with Bruce Lee, Joe Lewis became unassailablein tournament competition. Ten of the greatest karate men of the day foughtLewis, and all ten were knocked out before the end of the second round. Joe wasthe most successful competition fighter among those Bruce advised, and it wasBruce who suggested Joe try using boxing techniques in karate and who showed himhow to use the angular attack principle found in wing chun. Encouraged by Bruceto try out more realistic forms of combat, Lewis became one of the pioneers offull-contact karate in the early 1970s. In effect, Bruce Lee devised strategieswhile Lewis tested them out in the ring.. . . Long-range kicks and swinging punches from an opponent would be frustratedthrough a system of jams. Straight-line deflecting strikes, simultaneous blocksand strikes and mobile adaptable footwork patterns . . .It’s interesting to compare the above description (from Chapter 2) of theShaolin master martial art that evolved into wing chun with the description ofJoe Lewis’s title-winning contest against Greg Baines on 17 January 1970 in LongBeach Arena. Greg Baines was a kenpo karate stylist and California state’sheavyweight champion. Most of the traditional karate men in attendance thoughtthat the event was some kind of bizarre publicity stunt. They couldn’t quitebelieve that anyone would step into a ring in front of thousands of people withthe chance of having his face smashed by a back fist or his body buckled by aside kick.Rather than relying on scoring points for touching his opponent, which was morelike a game of tag, this bout marked the introduction of the full-contactfighting that was being pioneered by Lewis. Baines, the crowd’s favourite, tooka very traditional wide and deep stance, the kind that allowed karatepractitioners to break bricks and boards. When Lewis started dancing around thering, darting in and out on the balls of his feet, the audience could barelystifle its chuckles. Yet right from the bell, Lewis scored points against theless mobile Baines. Whenever Baines attempted to land a kick, Lewis interceptedand jammed it, countering with a left hook or combination punch. When Bainesattempted a punch, Lewis trapped the strike and countered at the same time withwhat Bruce called a ‘stop-hit’. Before the end of the first round, the audiencewas almost stunned into silence. This wasn’t karate!Baines fared no better in the second round. Each time he set himself to strike,Lewis moved away, and each time he withdrew his punching hand, Lewis flowed intothe gap with a vicious hook. Although Baines had good karate skills, Lewiswasn’t observing the traditional methods. His moves were quick and light and hekept his hands raised high, rather than held low. Instead of locking out in theusual karate-style punch, he snapped his fists in the whip-like way of the kungfu practitioner. The coup de grace was a move that had never been seen in akarate competition. Lewis faked a move, almost in slow motion, and switchedleads, creating an opening for a double hook combination that sent Bainestumbling to the mat.This knockout signalled the end for more than Greg Baines. People could nolonger argue or boast of traditional karate’s superiority. Some tried to arguethat Lewis’s performance wasn’t really martial arts at all, while others saidthat Baines had fought without commitment or spirit. What had proved to be sostunningly effective was the insight of Bruce Lee’s martial concepts allied withJoe Lewis’s ability as a competitive martial artist.Throughout the contest, the announcer kept referring to the bout as Americankickboxing, and the mistaken terminology stuck. As a result, Joe Lewis becameknown as the man who pioneered kickboxing in America. For their part, most ofBruce Lee’s followers have always looked at the 1970 Lewis v Baines contest asthe birth of tournament jeet kune do.Bruce Lee’s skills extended to places even he wasn’t aware of; in his June 1982interview for Playboy, boxing champion Sugar Ray Leonard said:One of the guys who influenced me wasn’t a boxer. I always loved the catlikereflexes and artistry of Bruce Lee and I wanted to do in boxing what he was ableto do in karate [sic]. I started watching his movies before he became reallypopular in Enter the Dragon and I patterned myself after a lot of his ways. Leewas an artist and like him I try to go beyond the fundamentals of my sport.The tae kwon do master Jhoon Rhee, who respected Bruce’s skill and hisrebellious attitude, devised and introduced the Safe-T equipment which was firstutilized in the World Professional Karate Championships in 1974. Bruce’straining methods were made public by Lewis’s competition appearances, combinedwith the use of Jhoon Rhee’s protective equipment. In this way, Bruce was at theroot of the growth of martial arts into a competition sport in the West, whichin its infancy was nothing less than applied jeet kune do.Joe Lewis and his student, Tom Tannenbaum – the producer of Longstreet who hadmoved on to become head of Universal TV – were instrumental in producing aninety-minute special out of the 1974 championships. This event established thesport of what became known as full-contact karate or American kickboxing. Fromthis evolved the mixed martial arts (MMA) or ultimate fighting contests oftoday. At first MMA would simply pit one style against another, say judo againstwrestling, or boxing against karate, before martial sportsmen began tocross-pollinate techniques as Bruce himself had done.There is no doubt that Bruce’s fighting methods emerged from having first fullyembodied wing chun principles. This evolved into jun fan gung fu with thegradual assimilation of techniques drawn from various other styles of kung fu,such as praying mantis, along with techniques from Western boxing, Thai boxing,ju-jitsu and fencing, amongst others. Howard Williams was only fifteen when hebegan training with Bruce Lee and James Lee at their Oakland school, and herecalls that the transition from jun fan to jeet kune do was not a gradual onebut happened almost overnight.Williams recalls, ‘Bruce was coming up to Oakland every other weekend with hisfamily, between Green Hornet shoots. One day he said, “Listen, this is not junfan; it’s now jeet kune do.” Bruce showed us this new stance. We thought it wasboxing; it looked more like kickboxing at first but he still used the trappingfrom wing chun.’Tim Tackett, a schoolteacher who trained with Bruce, says, ‘There are differentaspects to it – sensitivity, trapping, grappling, boxing, kicking, kickboxing –and putting all those together. Once you have experienced it all and can do it,then you have a core. This core is the thing that’s going to come out of youwhen the guy steps out of a truck because you had an accident with him, or youaccidentally ran him off the road, and he’s just had twelve beers, and he’s 260pounds and couldn’t care less if you’re a black belt. Whatever comes out of youthen has to be automatic.’‘Bruce could change in midstream,’ says Dan Inosanto. ‘One minute he couldfavour a kicking system, then at middle range he could explode like a savagestreet fighter or Western boxer. When it got in tight, it would look like wingchun. When he got to the ground it was like ju-jitsu. Bruce knew how tointegrate techniques. If there was a common thread, then it was an understandingof range.’Doug Palmer says, ‘Although Bruce Lee was grounded in the school of wing chun,every time I met him he’d expanded the style to include not only the corpus ofwhat had gone before but a whole new dimension that magnified the effectivenessand universality of his own school. This wasn’t mere technique, jeet kune dotranscended style. Jeet kune do was an approach, a philosophy, a way.’Taky Kimura recalls, ‘Bruce called me and said that chi sao was not the focalpoint any more, as we had thought earlier. I was shocked. He probably realizedthe limitations of certain aspects of wing chun when trying to practise stickyhands with someone like Kareem Abdul Jabbar. I have to say that at that time Ididn’t understand what Bruce meant, but now I do. I guess this was part of hisliberation as a martial artist.‘He didn’t mean chi sao was useless, only that it was not the nucleus of what hewas teaching in Los Angeles. He realized that it was an important part of thetotality in combat, but not the only part of it, as he emphasized during hisdays in Seattle where he taught wing chun.‘For a wing chun man, chi sao is probably the most important aspect of trainingand it dictates the student’s approach to fighting. He didn’t have the tunnelvision of the classical kung fu man. The wing chun that I know is the versionBruce taught me and I guess its structure takes away a lot of the impracticalthings that you can learn in other systems. But don’t misunderstand me; I don’twant to take away anything from anybody else.’Unfortunately after Bruce Lee’s death a lot of martial artists, believing thatthey were following Bruce Lee’s philosophy, cast aside their systems only todiscover that with no core structure, they were virtually useless. They simplymoved away from being blindly traditional to becoming blindly non-traditional.This common misunderstanding of the philosophy of jeet kune do prompted manymartial artists to take a ‘salad-bar’ approach that fell far short of what BruceLee intended. To ‘absorb what is useful’ doesn’t mean simply to select, assembleand accumulate techniques from many different styles, thinking that your newmix-and-match hybrid will have the best of everything. To absorb what is usefulfirst requires a core understanding that you can work from.‘However much people venerate Bruce Lee,’ says William Cheung, ‘this kind ofthinking is mistaken. You do need forms, otherwise how can you break away whenyou have nothing to break away from? Otherwise what have you except an amalgamof styles which is claiming to be free of styles? I say that we are born withoutknowledge. We have to acquire it first before we can be free of it.’Dan Inosanto echoes this: ‘Bruce didn’t want jeet kune do to have a blueprint;that was his whole philosophy at the time. I said, “Well, you’ve got to startfrom some place; even a child has to be taught something before he can expressfreedom.” ’But Bruce would sometimes point himself in one direction and his students inanother. He didn’t teach forms to any of his students; he still preferred toteach people who had already been through formal training, since only they couldappreciate what he had to offer. Bruce believed that novices needed to learnforms, but that once a certain level of understanding was reached the martialartist could go outside of fixed boundaries to where the true expression of theart is found. But a martial artist can’t begin from no stance, no form or notechnique, any more than a musician can go straight to being a virtuoso. Eachmust learn the fundamentals and forms of music or fighting, which he mayeventually use as a basis for improvisation and creativity.It is clear that Bruce Lee based his fighting method on wing chun, then went onto study other methods. This wasn’t so much a process of adding and accumulatingtechniques, but of embodying them into core principles. For example, all boxershave the same basic style, but Muhammad Ali didn’t fight like Joe Frazier, andmodern boxers fight differently from the early champions. Western martialartists have a more powerful build while Asian martial artists are lighter andfaster. In going beyond basic core skills, each fighter attempts to get the bestfrom his or her particular personal attributes – temperament, speed, power,strategic awareness and so on.Anyone who attempts to define jeet kune do runs the risk of being like those inthe fable of the blind men attempting to describe an elephant: one felt the tailso thought the elephant was like a snake; another felt its leg and thought itwas a tree, and so on. Human nature, being what it is, means that each personcan relate only to what he already understands. Naturally a wing chunpractitioner will readily identify the wing chun element of Bruce’s art.Before he met Bruce Lee, Jim Kelly had already applied jeet kune do principlesto karate, resulting in a different understanding to that of most of itspractitioners. Bruce recognized what Kelly had done and paid him the complimentof not choreographing Kelly’s fights in Enter the Dragon, telling Kelly heunderstood his own art and should do what he wanted.The real point of jeet kune do is that after a sufficient level of technicalability has been embodied there follows the possibility of furtherself-discovery and self-expression. Jeet kune do doesn’t apply to those of uswho are learning the root skills: it implies a level of mastery, or at the veryleast one of substantial competence.At the heart of his teaching, Bruce Lee wasn’t promoting a martial art: ratherhe was hoping to instil in his students a real sense of self-understanding.Anyone who identifies with or tries superficially to imitate Bruce Lee hasbecome trapped. To be inspired to experience and understand for oneself isexactly what he intended. The real help that Bruce Lee offers is the inspirationto self-help.The same truth was expressed by Jesus Christ, another teacher whose insightshave given way to various dogmatic and fundamentalist factions, when he said,‘Follow me and you will lose yourself, but follow yourself and you will findboth yourself and me.’ In the same way, Bruce Lee did not believe that oneshould put one’s faith in others or wait passively to be shown the way: heconsidered that each person must take some individual responsibility. Once, whenasked if he believed in God, he replied, ‘If there is a God, he is within. Youdon’t ask God to give you things; you depend on God for your inner theme.’As I once remarked about religion, ‘Put every great teacher together in a roomand they’d agree about everything, but put their disciples in there and they’dargue about everything.’ Bruce anticipated that this might well be the fate ofhis own teaching and often commented on the similarity between martial arts andreligions. He thought the classical arts were just as limited and out-of-touchwith life as dogmatic and fundamentalist religions. He was more concerned withembodying the living spirit that’s alive only at the very moment it’s beingexperienced, not when someone later writes or reads a description of it. Bruceintended jeet kune do to reflect the nature of the Tao itself, to be a vehiclethat could be used, not conveyed by words, grasped by the mind or fixed as asystem."},{"pageContent":" 30THE PATHLESS LANDIn a neatly typed fifteen-page essay, ‘The Tao of Gung Fu’, compiled in theUniversity of Washington’s campus library in 1962, Bruce Lee wrote:Gung fu is Tao; the spontaneity of the universe . . . The word ‘tao’ has noexact equivalent in English. The concepts of way, principle or even truth areall too narrow. Lao Tzu, the founder of Taoism, described it in the followingwords: ‘the way that can be expressed in words is not the enduring andunchanging Way’ . . . Tao is the principle underlying everything, the supremeultimate pattern, the principle of growth . . . the way man should order hislife to fit in with the Way the universe operates.After his collapse in May 1973, Bruce Lee told his older brother Peter that heplanned to live to be a hundred and told Chuck Norris, ‘When I’m thirty-five,I’ll stop working and spend the next ten years living quietly with my family andwill see nobody. Then I’ll come out again and see what I can do for my society.’Years earlier, in a long letter explaining his hopes and ambitions to hisgirlfriend and dancing partner, Pearl Cho, he declared his intention ofachieving ‘impossible goals’ before adding, ‘People will say I’m too consciousof success.’ He then went on to quote the late Charles Steinmetz, who when askedwhat branch of science would make the most progress in the next twenty yearsreplied, ‘Spiritual realization.’On another occasion Bruce made two drawings of himself: the first was of himselfas a young martial artist and action star, a square-jawed cartoon hero, notunlike the images found in modern Manga comics. The second image was of himselfas a wise old master like Bodhidharma. Bruce Lee was well aware of the twodivergent streams running through him, what George Tan has called the‘Confucian’ and the ‘Taoist’ in him.George Tan writes:The common view of Bruce is that he was a sort of Taoist; he used the word taoover and over again. But in reality he was more of a Confucian. The basicprecept of Taoism is that you accept things as they are and the world as it is.Taoists don’t try and push the river. But Confucians manipulate the world. BruceLee was someone who had somewhere to get to, and he had to get there quick. Andhe wasn’t about to let anyone stop him. Bruce was a Confucian in Taoist clothing. . . Bruce’s philosophizing came about when he needed to develop an image – adevice to market his martial art. He realized that there was more to be madefrom philosophizing than from getting punched in the face.Joe Lewis comments:When Bruce was attempting to add substance and essence to his art, he constantlyquoted Krishnamurti. He never used the name Krishnamurti in front of me, but allyou have to do is read a few of Krishnamurti’s books and you’ll find not onlysimilarities but direct wordings. . . . I used to address the audience after I’dwon a tournament and Bruce would have written out a little speech about jeetkune do. Only I could never get it right. I could never make sense of what he’dwritten for me. One time he said jeet kune do means the thus-ness of thetechniques. Like we’re all supposed to know what ‘thus-ness’ means.It was in the teachings of Jiddu Krishnamurti in particular that Bruce Lee foundthe philosophical underpinnings of jeet kune do. Krishnamurti was born in 1895to an impoverished family in southern India. His spirituality was recognizedearly, and at the age of ten he was adopted by an esoteric organization, theTheosophical Society, to be groomed as their future figurehead, and was sent tobe educated in England and France. In 1929 he renounced his role of ‘messiah’,saying that religious sects and organizations stand in the way of truth. Thoughhe continued to teach and lecture throughout the world, he remained unwilling tooffer any ready-made system for approaching this truth. ‘Truth is a pathlessland,’ he wrote. ‘Man cannot come to it through any organization, through anycreed, through any dogma, priest or ritual, nor through any philosophicalknowledge or psychological technique.’Bruce Lee took many of Krishnamurti’s sayings on self-realization and appliedthem to jeet kune do. In Freedom from the Known, speaking of the traditionalreligions, Krishnamurti wrote, ‘If you deny the traditional approach, as areaction, then you will have created another pattern in which you will betrapped.’ Referring to the classical martial arts, a sign on the wall of Bruce’sschool read, ‘Do not deny the classical approach, simply as a reaction, or youwill have created another pattern and trapped yourself there.’Krishnamurti’s message was that, by their very nature, all systems of thoughtand religion obscure the truth, which is a living force that cannot be named orpinned down. The core of his teaching was a dialogue with his students in whichthey were continually challenged to overcome ready-made concepts and come to astate of present attention, in the same way as the Zen master challenges hispupils. A great many of the aphorisms on jeet kune do attributed to Bruce Leewere taken directly, or adapted slightly, from writings and talks byKrishnamurti.Truth is not something dictated by your conditioning as a Hindu, or whateverreligion you belong to. The man who is really serious, with the urge to find outwhat the truth is, has no concept at all. He lives only in what is.KrishnamurtiFighting is not something dictated by your conditioning as a kung fu man, akarate man, or a judo man, or whatever. The man who is really serious, with theurge to find out what the truth is, has no martial art style at all. He livesonly in what is.Bruce LeeLinda Lee’s ex-husband Tom Bleecker writes:What does Bruce Lee have to offer that qualifies him as a philosopher? You’reaware that Lee failed out of college? There are college graduates working onphilosophy doctorates that are far more qualified on this subject. He wasanything but a philosopher. What he did was to occasionally play the Orientalcard at a party or interview. He was anything but a gifted philosopher.Ever since Albert Goldman put his poison pen to paper to write his denigratingarticles, much has been made of the idea that Bruce Lee was no more than afortune-cookie philosopher who used the bits and pieces of knowledge he’d gainedas a means to market himself and create a certain aura, without understandingmuch of what he uttered.Just because Bruce Lee dropped out of university doesn’t negate what he had tosay. For the record, I dropped out of school at fifteen, yet here I am apublished author, speaking with you on weighty philosophical matters. Since Iwrote the first edition of this book I have even seen my words and observationsattributed to Bruce Lee, but one can hardly blame him for that.On the one hand there are those who openly dismiss the philosophical aspect ofBruce’s life and work, while at the other extreme there are those whometiculously catalogue his shopping lists and letters that say no more than,‘See you next weekend, George,’ as if they were laden with pearls of wisdom.Gone are the days when innocent fans used to sit around the Ouija board tryingto contact Bruce. Now the Indian branch of the Master Lee Fan Club deifies ‘Him’as a fully fledged messiah, fulfilling Bruce’s prophecy that his art would oneday be dogmatized as a kind of religion.When Bruce Lee said that ‘styles are parts dissected from the whole, divisive bynature, and keep men apart’, he was referring to various systems of martial art:karate, kung fu, judo and so on. But if you take this aphorism and reapply it tolife, it becomes even more valuable. Apply it to any religion or ideology, orany interest or habit, and ‘style’ can just as easily apply to a lifestyle, justas ‘way’ can apply to a way of fighting, way of thinking, way of voting, way ofworshipping and so on.It refers to anyone who believes that his religion is superior to another’s, orthat her race or nationality is better. It points towards anyone whose happinessdepends exclusively on the results of a particular football team, or on havingthe right designer labels to wear. Most poignantly of all it applies to allthose ‘fan-tasists’ who idealize or idolize Bruce Lee, just as much as itapplies to those with an axe to grind, who criticize or disparage Bruce,ultimately at their own expense.Stirling Silliphant believes, ‘If he’d lived, I think Bruce would have become agenuinely great man. All my life I’ve known only idiots. I define an idiot as aperson who makes less of himself than he could be by blaming his actions onsomething, or someone, outside himself. The only non-idiot I’ve known, the onlyperson I’ve seen who exercised his abilities, whether physical or intellectual,to the highest possible degree, is Bruce Lee.’"},{"pageContent":" APPENDIX 1BRUCE LEE FILMS, TV AND BOOKSCOMPLETED WORKSCHILDHOOD FILMS (1941–60)Bruce Lee’s first screen appearance was at the age of three months, when he wascarried on stage as a baby girl by his father in a Chinese picture called GoldenGate Girl, made in San Francisco. His first professional role was at the age ofsix in the Hong Kong-made film, The Birth of Mankind (1946). When he was six,Bruce also played his first role under the name Lee Siu Lung (Lee LittleDragon), appearing in The Kid (1950), which was based on a popular comic strip,and with his father, comedian Li Hoi Cheun, cast in a supporting role. Bruce Leeplucked audience heartstrings for the next decade as he portrayed a series ofhard-luck orphans and abandoned heirs in dramas with titles like A Son is Born(1953), An Orphan’s Tragedy (1955) and Orphan’s Song (1955). His last film ofthis type, made just before he moved to the US, was The Orphan (1960, but shotin 1958). The teenage Bruce Lee played a juvenile delinquent redeemed by ateacher who is eventually revealed as his father.The young Bruce Lee made several other films, playing street urchins and orphansin tragedies like A Mother’s Tears and comedies like It’s Father’s Fault. Laterhe played juvenile delinquents and rebels in films such as The Thunderstorm,which imitated the Blackboard Jungle-style films being made in the USA.Altogether Bruce Lee appeared in more than twenty pictures as a child actor, thebest-known being The Orphan, a film about Hong Kong street gangs made when hewas eighteen and which gave him his only leading role. It’s certain that therewould be no interest in any of these films today were it not for Bruce’sparticipation in them.1941 Golden Gate Girl (aka Tears of San Francisco)1946 The Birth of Mankind1948 Wealth is Like a Dream (Fu gui fu yun)1949 Sai in the Dream (Meng li xi shi)1950 Blooms and Butterflies—The Kid (aka My Son, Ah Chung, Kid Chung) (Xi lu xiang)1951 Infancy (aka The Beginning of a Boy) (Ren zhi cu)1953 Myriad Homes (aka Countless Families) (Qian wan ren jia)—Blame it on Father (aka It’s Father’s Fault, The Bad Boy) (Fu zhi guo)—The Guiding Light (aka A Son is Born) (Ku hai ming deng)—A Mother’s Tears (Ci mu lei)—In the Face of Demolition (Wei lou chun xiao)1955 An Orphan’s Tragedy1955 Gu xing xue lei — Gu er xing—Love (aka Carnival) (Ai)—Love: Part 2 (Ai xia ji)—Orphan’s Song—We Owe It to Our Children (Er nu zhai)1956 Too Late for Divorce (Zhia dian na fu)—Wise Guys Who Fool Around (Zao zhi dang cu wo bu jia)1957 Darling Girl—The Thunderstorm (Lei yu)1960The Orphan (Ren hai gu hong)The Green Hornet (1966–7)Based on the popular radio drama The Green Hornet, created by George W.

Bruce Lee and Van Williams alsomade a personal appearance as themselves on a rock and roll variety show, Wherethe Action Is (episode 19 of 27, aired 1 September 1966). This show toured theUS and featured popular music acts of the day, such as the Mamas and Papas andthe Knickerbockers, playing games and interviewing celebrities.The Green Hornet (1974)After Bruce Lee’s death, 20th Century Fox couldn’t simply re-release itstwenty-five Green Hornet episodes for TV because, if they’d been aired on adaily basis, like M*A*S*H* or Frasier, they would have been run in less than amonth. So in late 1974, the studio released a movie called The Green Hornet,which was a sloppy compilation thrown together from three of the TV episodes(‘The Praying Mantis’, ‘The Hunters and the Hunted’, and ‘Invasion from OuterSpace’). It was so poorly edited that it made no sense at all, and to add to theconfusion, random fight scenes from other episodes were thrown in to lengthenthe action sequences. The film was billed as a ‘Kato and the Green Hornet’ filmand stills from other Bruce Lee films were used to promote it. Ambiguousnewspaper ads even implied that it was a new Bruce Lee movie.In the summer of 2004, Kevin Smith was writing a screenplay for a new series ofThe Green Hornet, which was originally scheduled for release in 2005. It wasrumoured that Jet Li would portray Kato and Jake Gyllenhaal would play the GreenHornet. In 2004, Smith put the film on the back burner, then in 2006 heannounced that he no longer had anything to do with The Green Hornet project,which has subsequently failed to materialize.CAMEO APPEARANCES (1967–9)Ironside (1967)A wheelchair-bound Detective Ironside battles the bad guys on the streets of SanFrancisco.Season 1, Episode 7: ‘Tagged for Murder’: aired 26 October 1967Writer: Arthur WeingartenDirector: Charles S.

MartinsonThe Big Boss (1971)US title: Fists of Fury. Bruce Lee’s first two feature films were muddled intransit to the US. His first movie, The Big Boss, was to be retitled The ChineseConnection for the US market, to link it to the hit drug-smuggling movie TheFrench Connection. The cans containing Bruce’s second film, Fist of Fury, werelabelled wrongly as Fists of Fury. The confusion was complete when the filmswere then placed in the wrong cans. As a result, in the US Bruce’s first film isknown as Fists of Fury; while his second film is known as The ChineseConnection.In The Big Boss, Cheng is a city boy who moves with his cousins to work in anice factory. He does this with a promise to his mother never to get involved infighting. However, when members of his family begin disappearing after meetingthe management of the factory, he is forced to break the vow and confront thevillainy of the boss.Writers: Bruce Lee and Lo WeiDirector: Lo WeiMusic: Peter Thomas, Joseph KooBruce Lee: Cheng Chao AnMaria Yi: Chow MeiJames Tien: Hsiu ChienYin-Chieh Han: Hsiao Mi (The Boss)Malalene: Wu Maing (Prostitute)Tony Liu: Hsiao Chiun (Mi’s Son)Quin Lee: Ah KunNora Miao: Drink stand ownerSan Chin: Hua SzeChao Chen: ForemanChia Ching Tu: UncleFilmed on location in Pak Chong, ThailandReleased: 3 October 1971Of all of Bruce Lee’s films, The Big Boss has the highest number of kills byBruce Lee’s character. In Fist of Fury the kill count is nine; in Way of theDragon it is one and in Enter the Dragon it is five. The Big Boss has thirteen.When the film was released in the US, the death of Hsiao Mi (The Boss) was cutdown to show him simply being stabbed in the chest with a knife, in order forthe film to receive an R rating. The original version of his death not onlyshows an explicit close-up of the knife in his chest but Cheng’s fingerspiercing the rib cage and blood flowing from under his shirt, which would havegiven the film an X rating.When the movie was first released in 1971 in Hong Kong, it featured multiplescenes that have since disappeared from all mainstream edits of the film as aresult of the 1972 Hong Kong movie-censorship crackdown. In the case of The BigBoss, this includes scenes of a body being cut in half with a circular saw, ablood vessel cut with a knife, causing blood to spew from a character’s foreheadand, most infamous of all, a man having his head split open with a hand saw.However, when these deletions were stipulated, editors also took the opportunityto cut out further sequences to increase the pace of the film. The deleted shotsand scenes exist in the public domain only as still photos or quick snippets offootage in trailers, though there are private collectors who possess copies ofthe missing footage.In the mainstream edit of The Big Boss, white ‘splice lines’ and jumps in thesoundtrack often make it evident where scenes have been removed.Fist of Fury (1972)Chen returns to China only to learn of his beloved teacher’s death, which isbeing aggravated by continual racial harassment from the Japanese population inthe area.

An American karate champion, Chuck Norris (Colt), has a showdown with Tangin Rome’s Colosseum, in what is arguably the best fight scene Lee ever put onfilm. In the climax of the fight Colt, who is used only to the more rigidtechniques of karate, is bewildered by Tang’s broken rhythms – just as theRhythm Man character was to have fought in The Silent Flute.Writer/Directors Bruce LeeCinematography: Nishimoto TadashiBruce Lee: Tang Lung (aka China Dragon)Nora Miao: Chen Ching HuaChuck Norris: ColtWei Ping Ao: HoHuang Chung Hsin: Uncle WangBob Wall: RobertWong In Sik: Japanese fighterUS title: Return of the Dragon. Because Way of the Dragon was released in the USafter Enter the Dragon, it is known there as Return of the DragonFilmed On location in Rome and at Golden Harvest studios in Hong KongReleased: 30 December 1972The film was heavily cut in the US and UK, and was banned outright inScandinavia.After completing The Big Boss and Fist of Fury, Bruce Lee knew that he wouldnever have to work for $7,500 a film again. He suggested that he and Chow form apartnership, Concord Productions. Unfortunately, at the beginning of 1972,Chow’s first decision was to ask the inadequate Lo Wei to direct a new film tobe called Yellow-Faced Tiger. Although Bruce went through the charade of severalplanning sessions, he was secretly planning to write, direct and star in his ownmovie, Way of the Dragon. Yellow-Faced Tiger was eventually made, starring ChuckNorris and retitled Slaughter in San Francisco.Game of Death (1972)It was in 1972 that Bruce Lee donned his yellow catsuit and began work on whatwould surely have been a far better film than any of those he actuallycompleted. Written and directed by Bruce, the film was to star him alongside ChiHon Joi, Dan Inosanto, Kareem Abdul Jabbar and other notable martial artists.Further starring roles were intended for George Lazenby and Betty Ting Pei. Atthe time of his death Bruce had approximately twenty-eight minutes of film inthe can at Golden Harvest in Hong Kong. Although there was a working script, themovie was essentially open-ended and improvised. All of the films Bruce madewere changed during the course of filming and there is no reason to suspect thatGame of Death would have been any differentOnly three fight scenes from Game of Death have ever been seen by the public:the bako and nunchaka duel with Dan Inosanto; the fight with Korean hapkidoexponent Chi Hon Joi; and, of course, the confrontation with Kareem AbdulJabbar, master of ‘no style’. Other planned fight scenes are said to haveincluded a muay thai exponent and a room full of traps and battles with variousother martial artists. These would have included some of the following: BoloYeung from Enter the Dragon, Wong In Sik from Way of the Dragon, James Tien fromFist of Fury, tae kwon do practitioner Jhoon Rhee, and possibly Sammo Hung andChuck Norris. Bob Wall says that he was the intended opponent for level five,Taky Kimura was invited to play a role and declined and Wong Sheun Leung mayhave been a wing chun exponent.Further scenes unseen by the public are said to exist, along with a hundred-pagescript. It is also reported that rather than having twenty minutes of film inthe can, Bruce had more than four hours’ worth. It’s also speculated that theLee estate may be holding on to further unseen footage from Game of Death withthe intention of maximizing revenue by releasing it piecemeal, but it’s hardlylikely that they would have sat on this material for so long, other than forreasons of privacy.Brad Kaup, editor of A Warrior’s Journey, says that discounting alternativeout-takes they used all of the scenes from Game of Death that they had access toand does not subscribe to rumours that there is any missing footage, yet headds, paradoxically, that people should continue to search. According to thecurrent research of Nick Clarke, along with investigations made in the 1970s byDon Atyeo and Felix Dennis for Kung Fu Monthly magazine, further footage fromGame of Death definitely exists.In 1975, Kung Fu Monthly claimed that a Toronto cinema showed ‘unreleasedfootage from Bruce Lee’s last film’ in which a battle with a samurai played byYasuaki Kitura was one of the unseen fights. In 1980, the Wometco Home Theaterapparently showed a documentary about Bruce that contained previously unseenfootage from Game of Death. In Malaysia a Seasonal Film video is said to exist,also featuring unseen footage. And in 1978, JKD Hong Kong Club magazine produceda special edition ‘Game of Death Extract’ describing this missing footage.Similarly, the Philippine Film Archives are said to contain rare out-takes.Another eyewitness claims to have seen ninety minutes of continuous action backin 1975. One rumour claims George Lucas got hold of some of the film forinclusion in a future Star Wars project . . . and so the myths continue.Bearing in mind that anyone who owns unseen footage of Bruce Lee would stand tomake a lot of money from it, is it likely that they would have kept it hiddenaway for more than thirty years? Apart from the obvious out-takes, alternativetakes and mis-takes that occur during the course of any film production, isthere really any more genuine unseen footage of Bruce Lee in existence?As a key player in the martial arts movie world and an expert of Mandarincinema, one person who can shine a light on the situation is Bey Logan, who doesbelieve that unseen footage of Bruce Lee exists somewhere in the Golden Harvestarchives. But, he adds, ‘it’s unlikely that they know where it is, or are evenaware that they have it. On the other hand, anyone with any idea of what to lookfor doesn’t have access to it.’Fist of Unicorn (1972) aka Unicorn PalmWhen Bruce Lee returned to Hong Kong in 1970, one of the first people he soughtout was his old childhood friend and fellow child actor Siu Kee Lun, betterknown as Unicorn. And it was Unicorn who acted as the go-between when Bruce wassounding out the possibility of doing the ‘Kuan Yu’ project with Shaw Brothers.At a meeting with representatives of the Sing Hoi Film Company, Unicorn was toldquite plainly that he was no box-office draw and had no reputation, and that theproposed film, starring himself, could only be made if it somehow involved BruceLee. Bruce was always generous to his friends and had already given Unicorn therole of head waiter in Way of the Dragon. Now he helped his friend further byarranging the fight scenes for this film, which Unicorn was putting together ona shoestring budget.Footage of Bruce arriving on the set and coaching the actors was later contrivedand manipulated into a new storyline, and when the film was eventually released,Bruce wasn’t just credited with the fight arranging, but was given star billingas its leading actor.Enter the Dragon (1973)Lee, a member of the Shaolin Temple, is recruited by a British agent,Braithwaite, to infiltrate a criminal operation run by a renegade Shaolin monk,Han. Lee is then sent to a martial arts tournament being held on Han’s privateisland. He is also told that Han’s men tried to abduct his sister three yearsearlier and that rather than submit to them she committed suicide. Also at thetournament are misfits Roper, who needs prize money to pay off gambling debts,and Williams, who is on the run from the police. All three soon find themselvespitted against Han’s private army as he defends his underground labyrinth ofnarcotics and prostitution.In almost every scene involving a large group of extras in white karate suits,there are a few who seem unable to stop grinning with delight at seeing theirreal-life hero in action.Writer: Michael AllinDirector: Robert ClouseProducers: Paul Heller and Fred Weintraub (Sequoia) and Bruce and Raymond Chow(Concord) for Warner BrothersCinematography: Gil HubbsEditors: Kurt Hirshler and George WattersMusic: Lalo SchiffrinBruce Lee: LeeJohn Saxon: RoperJim Kelly: WilliamsPeter Archer: ParsonsAhna Capri: TaniaBob Wall: OharraShih Kien: HanAngela Mao: Su LinBolo Yeung: BoloBetty Chung: Mei LingGeoffrey Weeks: BraithwaiteFilmed: On location in Hong KongReleased: 19 August 1973Note: Enter the Dragon was Bruce Lee’s fifth film, but the first to go ongeneral release in the US. His fourth film, Game of Death, was incomplete at thetime of his death and was released posthumously after much meddling.After Bruce’s unexpected death, the Warner Bros publicity department took apragmatic view of circumstances. As one executive put it, Bruce’s death wasworth a two-million-dollar publicity campaign, and the box-office take wasfurther augmented when Raymond Chow raised his admission prices by more than 50per cent.Enter the Dragon wasn’t such a hit with his Chinese audience. They were upsetthat it had been released in the West first, as it added to the feeling thatBruce Lee had gone from being a Chinese hero to just another Oriental heavy in aHollywood thriller. The Chinese preferred Bruce as the underdog triumphing overthe odds, and it’s true that there is little of Lee’s natural charm in thisfilm. The Chinese, who had come to look on him as a national hero, perhaps evensomething of a messiah, felt that he’d abandoned them and left them without arepresentative. The Japanese, on the other hand, had no trouble with the styleof Enter the Dragon and the film was an enormous hit there. Raymond Chow hadn’teven bothered to release Bruce’s earlier films in Japan, knowing that they wouldnever accept a Chinese star, but Enter the Dragon turned out to be an evenbigger hit in Japan than it was in the States, prompting Chow to release all ofBruce’s films there, further increasing their earnings.I had no illusion about Enter the Dragon being a great film, or even a good one.It was more of the same Bond-ish junk that I’d seen a thousand times andoutgrown years before. Enter the Dragon itself hadn’t affected me; it was BruceLee, who’d leapt, shining, from the screen.Davis MillerThe story is basically a mishmash of Bond plots, though in retrospect it alsoblends genres, which helps make the film a classic. Just as the later Kill Billfilms combined elements of martial arts, spaghetti Westerns, samurai and yakuzafilms with the archetypal revenge plot, their predecessor Enter the Dragon doesmuch the same thing. Already combining spy and martial arts films, Enter theDragon also adds ‘blaxploitation’ to its content: from his first appearance onscreen, Jim Kelly’s Williams is a character who could have walked straight outof Shaft.Even amid all the action and excitement of his life, Bruce maintained the hopeof educating people through films with both a surface story and a deepermessage, though he was never able to fully realize this ambition to educatepeople about the inner aspects of his art. The thousands of people that streamedinto the cinemas weren’t going to Bruce Lee movies to learn about awareness ordiscover freedom, but there are nonetheless lessons hidden in the films. Theteaching sequence at the beginning of Enter the Dragon was added to the scripton Bruce’s initiative is unlike any other part of the film, and is a significantinclusion.OTHER MATERIALMany clips of relevance to Bruce Lee’s life and work can be viewed on theYouTube website. These include his demonstration of the one-inch punch at theLong Beach International Karate Tournament of July 1964, his screen test for20th Century Fox in February 1965, and his December 1971 television interviewwith Pierre Berton. Searches will also bring up other related material,including interviews with Dan Inosanto, who shows the viewer his uniquecollection of Bruce Lee memorabilia, including some of the signs that hung onthe wall of Bruce’s gung fu institutes.BRUCE LEE: BOOKS AND ARTICLESChinese Gung Fu: The Philosophical Art of Self-Defense (1963)This short manual was written by Bruce, using photographs taken in the parkinglot of Ruby Chow’s restaurant in Seattle, showing the jun fan gung fu (wingchun) techniques he was using at the time.Wing Chun Kung-Fu (1972)This small book illustrates the basic principles of wing chun and was compiledwhile Bruce was working with James Lee in Oakland. It shows James demonstratingthe first wing chun form, the sil lum tao. Bruce gave authorship and credit forthe book to James as he believed he had already moved some distance from ‘pure’wing chun, and because James was seriously ill. Bruce Lee is therefore creditedonly as ‘technical editor’.Bruce Lee’s Fighting Method: volumes 1–4 (1977)These four volumes (1: Self Defense Techniques; 2: Basic Training; 3: Skill inTechniques; and 4: Advanced Techniques) show Bruce Lee’s system evolving andfeature photographs from his time working with Dan Inosanto in Los Angeles.The Tao of Jeet Kune Do (1975)Not written for publication as such, this book was drawn from notes made forBruce Lee’s own personal study during the period he was laid up with his backinjury in 1969. It has notes and drawings on various fighting systems includingkung fu, boxing, wrestling and fencing. Much of the material was taken fromother books on fencing and from the US Army Boxing Manual, as well asphilosophical nuggets from various places such as The Sourcebook of ChinesePhilosophy, D. T. Suzuki’s essays on Zen Buddhism and the teachings ofKrishnamurti. Although Bruce had no intention of publishing these notes, fearingthey would be exploited, they were edited (mainly by Gilbert L. Johnson) andpublished in 1975 on the initiative of Linda Lee.MAGAZINE ARTICLESBruce Lee wrote several articles for various newspapers such as the Hong KongStandard and also for martial arts magazines. One such article is ‘LiberateYourself from Classical Karate’, written in 1971 for Black Belt magazine."},{"pageContent":" APPENDIX 2BRUCE LEE FILMS AND TVPOSTHUMOUS WORK AND INDIRECT INVOLVEMENTKung Fu (1972—)In the week ending 6 May 1973, around the time Enter the Dragon was beingwrapped up, the Kung Fu TV series starring David Carradine was the number oneshow on US television, attracting a regular audience of 28 million viewers.More than once Chuck Norris has admitted that his acting is a little pedestrianand that he’s not blessed with great powers of expression. As Norris himself putit, ‘David Carradine is about as good a martial artist as I am an actor.’Perhaps anticipating criticism of his limited martial arts abilities, Carradineonce claimed that ‘many of Bruce’s moves were done by doubles’. In fact, in hisentire career Bruce Lee only ever used a double on three shots. In the openingsequence of Enter the Dragon a gymnast did the somersault; this same gymnastlater did the back flip in Bruce’s controversial fight scene with Bob Wall.Bruce’s back flip in Fist of Fury was also doubled by a stunt actor, Yuen Wah.In 1986, a second Kung Fu TV movie was made featuring a young Brandon Leeplaying Caine’s son, Chung Wang. Towards the end of the film, Chung Wang asksCaine if he is his father. The question is more than ironic since, in real life,it was Brandon’s father who came up with the concept for the series. In a secondmovie, Kung Fu: The Next Generation (1987), the action moves to the present dayand centres on the story of Johnny Caine (Brandon Lee), who is now thegreat-grandson of Kwai Chang Caine.Two decades after the first television series ended, a further related seriesfollowed the adventures of a descendant of Kwai Chang Caine and ran for fouryears from 1993 to 1997. Entitled Kung Fu: The Legend Continues, it againstarred Carradine, whose character is now the grandson of the original Caine. Asa tranquil, philosophical father, he leaves the fighting mainly to his detectiveson, played by Chris Potter.In June of 2006, Ed Spielman and Howard Friedlander announced that a featurefilm, which would serve as a prequel to the original Kung Fu series and takeplace in China, was in development. They remarked that David Carradine would notbe returning to the project and that it would not be ‘an effects-laden project’.The Shrine of Ultimate Bliss (1974)The Shrine of Ultimate Bliss was intended to be Bruce Lee’s follow-up to Enterthe Dragon, once he had completed Game of Death. The planned production budgetof $10 million and worldwide marketing budget of a further $10 million wereastonishing amounts at the time. By comparison, the 1974 James Bond film The Manwith the Golden Gun had ‘only’ a $7 million production budget and a $6 millionworldwide marketing budget. Forecasts that The Shrine of Ultimate Bliss wasexpected to gross around $400 million were not as ridiculous at it might firstappear. Enter the Dragon cost just $850,000 to produce and by 2006 had earnedmore than $265 million at the box office. And with a mere $130,000 productionbudget, Way of the Dragon went on to gross more than $85 million.But with the sudden death of ‘the world’s biggest star’ the film’s fate wassealed. On hearing of Bruce’s death, Sonny Chiba refused to sign his contractand promptly flew back to Japan. There was bad press too for the film’s otherstar George Lazenby, who, it turned out, was supposed to have dinner with Bruce,Raymond Chow and Betty Ting Pei the evening Bruce died. With no Bruce Lee,Warner Brothers dropped out and Raymond Chow immediately cut the film’sproduction budget from $10 million to $850,000, as well as slashing themarketing and promotional budgets.To try and keep the project alive, Chow brought in Asian stars Angela Mao, BettyTing Pei and Sammo Hung, as well as the Australian wrestler Roger Ward. He alsoinvited rival studio Shaw Brothers to become joint producers in order to helppay for the film’s still huge production costs – by Hong Kong film industrystandards at least.The British production, The Man from Hong Kong, was another attempt to hang onto the coat-tails of Bruce Lee’s career. Director Brian Trenchard-Smith broughtin Wang Yu, changed his name to Jimmy Wang Yu, and hired George Lazenby to playthe villain. Jimmy Wang Yu was a good martial artist, as were others like Jet Liand David Chiang, but none of them was Bruce Lee.HIDDEN DRAGON: UNMADE PROJECTS AND UNSEEN FOOTAGEIn Enter the Dragon, the sequence in the Shaolin temple where Lee teaches ayoung monk how to kick with feeling and without thinking was not in the originalscript and was added at Bruce’s insistence. But what was left out of the film isalso of some importance. Lee’s discussion with the head monk was much longer,before the following exchange was cut:As Lee pays his respects to his teacher, the head monk remarks that Lee’s skillhas gone beyond mere technique and is now one of spiritual insight. The monkasks Lee the same question Lee has just asked the young monk: what was hisimmediate feeling towards his opponent while they were sparring? Lee repliesthat he experienced no separate opponent. There was only one fluid, spontaneousinterplay of energy so that ‘When the opponent expands, I contract, and when hecontracts, I expand. And when there is an opportunity I do not hit; it hits byitself.’Joe Hyams once asked Bruce, ‘What if someone was to attack you and seriouslymeant to do you in? What then?’Bruce answered, ‘I would probably hurt him. If I did and I was on trial, I wouldplead not guilty, that I did not do it, it did it.’At first Hyams didn’t understand, so Bruce explained further. ‘I throw a balland you catch it. You walk into a dark room and without conscious thought youturn on the light switch. A child runs in front of your car and you jam on thebrakes. You don’t think about these things, they just happen. If someone triedto hit me, I wouldn’t think about it, it would just happen. I would do whateverwas called upon to be done without conscious thought.’Due to the limitations of the budget there is no behind-the-scenes or out-takesfootage from any of Bruce Lee’s first three films. Bruce’s first two films weremade for the cost of a 30-second TV commercial in the US at the time, so oftenonly one take and one print were made. Probably the only unseen Bruce Leematerial that exists is the private film shot on set by actors involved in thevarious movies.Bey Logan has mentioned a reel of film shot by Jon Benn, who played the heavy inWay of the Dragon, and there is also home-movie footage shot by Peter Archer andAhna Capri on the set of Enter the Dragon. Bob Wall says that Ahna Capri hasabout ten minutes of 8mm film of him sparring with Bruce on the set. He addsthat it may never be released because it can’t be made public without obtainingthe necessary clearances, which would have to be signed by Warners, Linda, etal., who would all want their cut. At one time Ahna Capri was asking $65,000 forher film from any private collector. Bob Wall claims to have two hours of filmof Bruce teaching James Coburn and Steve McQueen, as well as footage of Brucekicking the heavy bag, and of Bruce and Brandon on Hong Kong TV when Brandon wasfive years old. ‘Why haven’t I shown this stuff?’ he says. ‘We were gettingready to show it at the Imperial Palace in Las Vegas, but Linda killed it.’During the making of Enter the Dragon cameraman Henry Wong shot five hours of16mm film to be edited down to make a ten-minute behind-the-scenes documentary,which was to be used to promote the film prior to its release. Some of thisfootage featured Bruce’s unscripted fights with film extras and intruders on thefilm set. The cameraman sent all this material to Warners, but on completion ofthe ten-minute film, and with the studio’s approval, the New York editingcompany that assembled it destroyed the remaining film. Nobody realized at thetime that they might have destroyed the most valuable Bruce Lee film of all.Whenever the subject of cuts to Bruce Lee films comes up it usually concerns thecensored nunchaka scenes from the various versions of Fist of Fury or Way of theDragon, and similar missing scenes from Game of Death or Enter the Dragon. Now,thirty years on, much of that missing footage has been restored; the last timeEnter the Dragon was shown on TV in the UK the scenes were intact. The film thathas suffered most at the hands of the censors is The Big Boss. The infamous‘saw’ scene is never there, while other missing scenes mainly concern violentknife fights, the ‘bodies in ice’ scenes and Bruce’s scenes with the hooker. Asmentioned earlier, it is often possible to see the white splice lines thatappear on screen where these edits have been made and to hear jumps in thesoundtrack.Green Bamboo WarriorAt the time of Bruce Lee’s death he had completed only four films: The Big Boss,Fist of Fury, Way of the Dragon and Enter the Dragon. Once he’d gone back andcompleted Game of Death in South Korea he was also said to be planning a newproject called Green Bamboo Warrior. It now transpires that he had a script forthis as early as January 1972 and there are tapes of Lee explaining both thestoryline and production ideas. He had approached Enter the Dragon co-star BoloYeung to appear with him. Confusingly, Lee had originally planned to make GreenBamboo Warrior as his third movie, and at first planned to call it, Enter theDragon.Green Bamboo Warrior, which in Chinese logic alternatively translates as‘Conqueror of the Golden Mountain’, is set in San Francisco at the turn of thecentury. Bruce plays one of a group of Chinese workers who make the exhaustingsea voyage from China in search of the proverbial mountain of gold inCalifornia. Soon after their arrival they are put to work in a mining town,where conditions are harsh and brutal. As a skilled martial artist, Bruce iselected the leader of the gang of workers, and before long he is using hisskills to lead a rebellion against the cruel Western bosses. The foreman of themine holds Bruce at gunpoint, as the rest of the bosses beat him, tie him up andleave him in the mine to die. Despite being badly wounded, Bruce escapes andfinds refuge in the cabin of an old Chinese woman who also works for the mine.She tends to his injuries and nurses him back to health. Once he is recovered hevows to have his revenge with his weapon of choice: a length of green bamboo.Eventually he overcomes various challenges and becomes a hero to the Chineseworkers.While he was filming Enter the Dragon, a Hong Kong businessman, Andrew Vajna,who was making inroads into the film industry, approached Bruce. Bruce Lee madea pitch for Green Bamboo Warrior and Vajna was interested enough to seek outGolden Harvest executive Russell Cawthorne to begin work on an English versionof the script. As things turned out Vajna’s breakthrough eventually came as theproducer of Rambo: First Blood and the later Terminator movies.KUAN YU PROJECTJust before his death in July 1973, Bruce Lee was considering working with ShawBrothers Studios, possibly as a tactic to put pressure on Raymond Chow. Therumoured Shaw project, to be called The Seven Sons of the Jade Dragon, was tohave featured Bruce in period costume, playing the roles of all seven sons andtheir father.The storyline is typical: Kuan Yu rescues the daughter of a peasant who has beenkidnapped by a rich official on the eve of her wedding. Soldiers are sent tofind and kill him and he takes refuge in a temple. The soldiers flush him out byburning down the temple, but when they are certain he is dead Kuan Yu burstsfrom the flames and defeats them before fleeing the country.BRUCE AND ELVISAfter the filming of Way of the Dragon in Rome – and while Bruce Lee was workingon Game of Death – film producer Carlo Ponti cabled Bruce from Italy with anoffer of ‘a large sum to be determined’ to star in a film with Ponti’s wife,Sophia Loren. Bruce was also offered $2 million to make two movies for aHungarian producer.He turned down an offer from MGM to make a picture with Elvis Presley in whichthe king of kung fu would meet the karate king of rock and roll. However, bythis time the singer resembled a heavy training bag more than the karateexponent he’s supposed to have been.Elvis had picked up on karate while stationed in Germany with the Army in thelate 1950s. Back in the US he continued training, first with Bob Wall and ChuckNorris, then later with Ed Parker. But because Wall and Norris wouldn’t promotehim through the ranks as quickly as he would’ve liked, and refused to train himwhen he was stoned, Elvis moved on. Ed Parker was more easily persuaded andrapidly promoted Elvis to an eighth-degree black belt. In return, Parkerreceived $50,000 and a new Cadillac. Being the most famous celebrity to don akarate suit, karate circles knew what was good for business and were happy togive Elvis an inflated profile to go with his increasingly inflated size. BobWall and Chuck Norris continued to train Elvis’s wife, Priscilla. ‘Although hewas supposed to be a high-ranking black belt,’ says Bob Wall, ‘Priscilla couldkick the ass off Elvis.’Elvis’s tae kwon do ranking was equally questionable. Having given his Koreaninstructor a new car and $50,000 to start a new school – which the teacherpromptly spent on a new house for himself – Elvis was suddenly promoted to aseventh-degree black belt. Soon, the singer had advanced even higher to thenon-physical aspects of the fighting arts and, while others still sparredcrudely, Elvis would keep an eye on them as he polished off another burger andmeditated on the inner tranquillity offered by Percodan and Demerol. By now,Priscilla had taken up with a real karate champion, Mike Stone.Game of Death‘GAME OF DEATH’: 1978 REMAKEScheduled for release in 1978, Raymond Chow heralded Game of Death as ‘BruceLee’s greatest film’. According to Chow, Lee had over a hundred minutes of filmalready in the can, and Robert Clouse was brought in simply to shoot a couple of‘bridging sequences’ using Bruce lookalikes. As it turned out, only fifteenminutes of the original footage were usable, and a script had to be written toexploit it. Bruce’s intended storyline of a martial artist attempting toretrieve a national treasure was now replaced with a formulaic plot in which anactor struggles against a criminal agent who’s manipulating his career.Even so, with Chow claiming that HK$4.5 million was being spent, this was by farthe most expensive film Golden Harvest had undertaken. At one point, during theplanning, Golden Harvest approached not only Steve McQueen and James Coburn buteven Muhammad Ali and Pele!In the promotional material for the film, Robert Clouse is quoted as saying,‘This electrically charged film contains the most spectacular footage of theChinese-American superstar ever filmed. It is, we feel, a fitting memorial toBruce Lee.’ John Christopher Strong’s deceptively classy opening titles are goodenough to lead the unprepared viewer to think that he is about to enjoy anequally high-quality film. The Bond-style opening titles are accompanied bytheme music from John Barry, the composer of the music for many of the actualBond films. Once the film starts, however, the reality soon becomes apparent anda feeling of sadness descends on the viewer as dim shots of doubles aremismatched with snippets of the real Bruce Lee in action. In the film’s mostbizarre image, actor Hugh O’Brian talks to a cardboard cutout of Bruce. Yet,even this cardboard figure has more life and spirit than the pitiful affair thatfollows.Despite its simplistic story, the film is agonizingly contrived to includeseveral Bruce Lee stand-ins, along with footage from Fist of Fury and Way of theDragon and the plot device of plastic surgery, which allows ‘Bruce Lee’ tocompletely change his appearance halfway through the story. The sense ofbetrayal and exploitation is complete when footage of Bruce’s actual corpse isworked into the story. It’s a devastating irony that the death of Bruce’scharacter on the film set was a portent of the accidental shooting in 1993 ofBrandon Lee on the set of The Crow.The redeeming moments in the film are, of course, in the footage that Bruce shotbefore his death, the fights with Chi Hon Joi, Dan Inosanto and Kareem AbdulJabbar, which have been later used to much better effect in the Warrior’sJourney documentary (see below). In these scenes there’s a surge in the qualityof the action, but even these brief moments soon give way to inept, ham-fistedslugging. While one can hardly blame him for trying to dodge the bullet, in hisown biography of Bruce Lee, the film’s director Robert Clouse writes about Gameof Death as if he had nothing to do with it:Several people close to Raymond Chow suggested, even pleaded, that the projectbe buried forever. But Chow argued that the film had already been pre-sold tothe Japanese market, which had paid a great deal for the privilege. The finalcut, with an attempt to use two look-alikes, was disappointing at best. Therewere even some embarrassing moments, such as the scene where a head shot, takenfrom a previous Lee film, was optically attached to the body of one of thedoubles the head turning quite strangely and eerily. Yet the film was quitesuccessful, as was almost anything about Bruce Lee, no matter how tasteless orfraudulent.By the late 1970s, however, audiences were so desperate to see any new Bruce Leematerial that Game of Death equalled the revenue generated by Enter the Dragon.GAME OF DEATH II: 1982 REMAKE(AKA TOWER OF DEATH)Ng See Yuen’s attempt to rework Bruce Lee’s original footage for Golden Harvestis more exploitative dross made in a further attempt to perform the sametasteless trick. When the real Bruce Lee ‘dies’ halfway through, the movierapidly descends into macho posturing and speeded-up fight scenes, which lead toan interminable Bond-style sci-fi climax. As the Chinese sage Lao Tzu put it,‘Wine may become so dilute that few will drink of it.’REWORKED MATERIALAfter Bruce Lee’s death, there were many further attempts to piece together theincomplete footage of Game of Death. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s fan-basedattempts involving edited VHS tapes were sold through martial arts magazines’small ads. The most well-known of these are the so-called ‘Staycool’ Internetedits, but more recently we’ve had the opportunity to see Bruce Lee’s originalfootage edited into a more coherent form.A WARRIOR’S JOURNEYThe nearest we may ever get to seeing what Bruce Lee intended for Game of Deathis John Little’s documentary A Warrior’s Journey, based on a twelve-pagebreakdown written by Lee. After assembling the footage in its intended form,Little then set about adding a score and dubbing the dialogue. Chi Hon Joi andKareem Abdul Jabbar bridged the thirty-year gap and provided the dialogue fortheir respective Temple of Gold and Temple of the Unknown sequences. Consideringthat Little has watched Enter the Dragon over 500 times, he is probably bothcapable and entitled to have a stab at imitating the master, at least as far asdubbing Bruce Lee’s voice. Meanwhile, Dan Inosanto chose to offer his servicesto the Japanese company Artport, who made a generally less successful, thoughoccasionally superior, attempt at piecing together the same material.A Warrior’s Journey runs for around one hour and forty minutes, and is made upof an hour’s well-structured documentary, including interviews with the usualsuspects, leading up to the Game of Death footage. Additional material is alsotaken from home movies released by Linda Lee, which include Bruce presenting atrophy to Joe Lewis, along with clips from Longstreet and a selection ofout-takes and bloopers. The documentary was premiered on Irish TV in 1999 andwas seen again at a fan convention in Bradford in 2000. But by this time, beforeits official release, it had already been widely bootlegged.The Silent Flute (1979)Like the unfinished Game of Death, the unmade Silent Flute was to be a puremartial arts film. But in 1978, David Carradine acquired the rights to TheSilent Flute and a version of the film was made eventually in 1979 in Israel –not in Turkey as some have reported – with Jeff Cooper as the hero andChristopher Lee as Zetan.Carradine considered himself ‘perfect’ for the role of Cord the Seeker, adding,‘With my reputation I was sure I could get the picture made.’ In the end heopted to take the four roles Bruce would have played, commenting, ‘That BruceLee, man, he’s just too good. I must take over from him and carry on his work.’According to the film’s director, Richard Moore, the script was ‘unfilmable’,and Moore had further difficulties when Carradine insisted on using his oldbuddy, Jeff Cooper, in the role of Cord. According to the director, Cooper‘couldn’t act his way out of a paper bag’, so faced with trying to get aperformance out of him and going way over budget, Moore elected instead to bringthe film in on time.Before the part of Cord had been offered to Jeff Cooper, it was offered to JoeLewis, who turned it down because he was unwilling to work with Carradine. Joesaid, ‘They shot the film anyway and it came back a piece of junk.’ In the end,Lewis had to supervise the re-shooting of several of the fight scenes and hirereal martial artists to double for the actors used in some of the earliersequences. Mike Stone doubled for Carradine, who considered it an insult. JoeLewis ended up showing Carradine some slick easy moves, which they incorporatedinto the film, then Lewis doubled some of Jeff Cooper’s flying kicks at the endof the film.The film was released initially as Circle of Iron, and Bruce Lee’s name appearsno less than five times in the credits, although the film was far removed fromanything he’d intended. To this day, James Coburn still refuses to see the filmand has retained his copy of the original script, saying that the original had a‘higher aim’ than the one that was made. He was also less than impressed withCooper as a martial artist and felt quite sad about the whole affair. BrandonLee wanted to make a more faithful version of The Silent Flute, but died beforehe had the opportunity.Although they were never filmed, a number of concepts present in The SilentFlute can be seen in later movies and television, such as the Longstreetepisodes. In the pilot episode Li Tsung, played by Bruce Lee, teaches Longstreetto embrace his animal instincts and ‘learn the art of dying’, an idea borrowedfrom the Panther Man character, just as Rhythm Man’s ‘broken rhythm’ techniquefeatures in the fight with Chuck Norris in Way of the Dragon. In addition, somedialogue is used in Enter the Dragon as well as in the uncompleted Game ofDeath.In an ideal world, instead of the Kung Fu series and The Silent Flute beingmangled into a vehicle for Carradine, Bruce Lee would have taken the leadingrole in Kung Fu at the ascendancy of his powers, working with quality scriptsand direction.In August 1972, Bruce wrote a letter to his wife Linda saying that he wasworking on a film script with the working title Southern Fist, Northern Legs: anobvious reference to two different styles of kung fu. In the Bruce Leedocumentary, The Man and the Legend (1973), he speaks in Cantonese aboutelements of the storyline for this proposed film. But the storyline is sosimilar to that of The Silent Flute – a hero’s quest in which he seeks outvarious martial arts masters – that they would appear to be one and the sameidea."},{"pageContent":" APPENDIX 3BRUCE LEE:BEFORE AND AFTERWING CHUN ANCESTORS AND JEET KUNE DO DESCENDANTSWilliam Cheung has always claimed that Yip Man practised and taught two verydifferent versions of wing chun. Two generations before Yip Man learned the art,its grandmaster Leung Jan was spied on by a neighbour, Chan Wah Shun, whileteaching his two sons. Knowing he was being observed, he deliberately modifiedwhat he taught. Although Leung Jan decided eventually to take his neighbour as apupil, he continued to teach him a less effective version, fearing that thebigger, stronger Chan would claim the mastership after Leung’s death. Thesefears proved to be well founded, since after Leung and one of the sons had died,Chan drove the remaining son away and assumed mastership of the wing chunlineage (see diagram p. 310).From the age of thirteen to seventeen, Yip Man trained with Chan, before movingto Hong Kong to study at college. There he met an eccentric old man with aformidable reputation for kung fu. Yip Man challenged this old man and wasdefeated. The old man was Leung’s surviving son, who then told Yip Man about thetwo different versions of wing chun, going on to teach him the more authentic ortraditional method.Yip Man returned home and worked for several years as a police inspector untilhe fled to Hong Kong during the Communist revolution. When he was fifty-six, herevealed himself as the authentic master of wing chun and began teaching. In1954, William Cheung joined the school and later brought along the pupil who wasto become its most famous exponent, Bruce Lee.William Cheung says that Yip Man taught the ‘modified’ version of wing chun tohis students, and the ‘traditional’ version only to him. Although Bruce was apupil of Yip Man’s school, the bulk of his teaching came from the two seniorstudents, Wong Sheun Leung and William Cheung. Because Cheung had been sworn toan oath not to reveal the authentic system to anyone during Yip Man’s lifetime,he taught Bruce the modified form, but continued to drop hints about the lack ofeffectiveness of some of the techniques and how they could be improved.My own teacher Derek Jones studied both the ‘modified’ system with Victor Kan,and the ‘traditional’ system with William Cheung. Whether or not Derek tookWilliam Cheung’s assertions at face value is another matter, but he was in nodoubt as to which was the more effective system. Just as the praying mantismaster Gin Foon Mark told Bruce on his visit to New York, Derek Jones told us,‘The modified wing chun system lacks footwork, entry techniques and advancedstrategy: it is very limited.’Bruce Lee’s teenage friend and fellow student, Hawkins Cheung (William’snephew), teaches what he calls ‘classic’ wing chun at his school in Culver City,Los Angeles. ‘Modified, traditional, it’s all bullshit,’ says Hawkins. ‘That’sjust William making mischief,’ he adds, implying that William invented thishistorical divergence in the art, in order to promote his own teaching. If thisis true, then William Cheung should take the credit for what he did in making itmore effective, just as Bruce Lee and Derek Jones did.As Bruce Lee, William Cheung and Derek Jones evolved as martial artists, eachadapted and evolved wing chun in his own individual way, whether it was the‘mischief’ of William Cheung’s traditional wing chun, the genius of Bruce Lee’sjeet kune do or the devastating common sense of Derek Jones’s martial art ofbody, mind and spirit.[docimages/image23.jpg]This is a comprehensive, but by no means complete, list of Bruce Lee’s studentsfrom his Gung Fu Institutes in Seattle, Oakland and Los Angeles.Seattle InstituteIn October 1963, Bruce opened the first of his formal Jun Fan Gung Fu Institutesin Seattle – Bruce preferred the Cantonese gung fu rather than kung fu – at 4750University Way. His students included:Taky Kimura (assistant instructor): Still runs an import-export business inSeattle and treats all enquiries about Bruce Lee with patience, courtesy andgood humour. He speaks of Bruce with undiminished respect and affection.Doug Palmer: Now works as an attorney in Seattle. Doug spent the entire summerof 1963 with Bruce at the Lee family home in Hong Kong. Doug very generouslygave me copies of, and freedom to quote from, his extensive journals on thistrip and his other experiences as Bruce’s student and friend.Linda Emery: Became Mrs Bruce Lee and continues to guard jealously both hisreputation and his marketing rights, which have now passed to Bruce and Linda’sdaughter Shannon. After Bruce’s death, Linda married Tom Bleecker, with whom sheco-authored the biography The Bruce Lee Story. After their divorce, Lindamarried entrepreneur Bruce Cadwell.Sue Ann Kay: Was Linda’s best friend, who originally introduced her to Bruce’sgung fu class.Jesse Glover: Met Bruce Lee in 1959 and was probably his first official student.He taught Bruce some judo and grappling moves and is now teaching what he calls‘non-classical’ wing chun.Ed Hart: Also teaches ‘non-classical wing chun’ after working for twenty yearswith Jesse Glover. He describes wing chun as ‘the foundation of Bruce’s art’,adding that the resilience of its forms derives from the fact that tendons aretwenty times stronger than muscles.Mike Lee: Also aligned with the ‘non-classical’ wing chun faction.James DeMile: Now teaches ‘wing chun do’. He was hired by Richard Branson toteach Virgin Airlines cabin crew techniques to deal with violent and abusivepassengers in air rage incidents.De Welle ‘Skip’ Ellsworth: Now head of the Log House Builders Association ofNorth America. His website still contains a memorial to Bruce, who he describesas ‘the greatest martial artist who ever lived’.Patrick Strong: Based in Indianapolis, now teaches ‘combative solutions’. Asystem with ‘a core of JKD’ to deal with street assaults and real-lifesituations.Other Seattle students included Leroy Garcia, who taught Bruce to drive, andJoseph Cowles.Oakland InstituteThe second Jun Fan branch opened in Oakland in August 1964. Personnel included:James Yimm Lee (assistant instructor): When Bruce and Linda moved to Oakland in1964, they went to live with James Lee’s family. Because Bruce felt he wasmoving away from wing chun, and James needed the money, Bruce credited him asthe author of his book on the first wing chun practice form, the sil lum tao.James died of cancer on 28 December 1972.Howard Williams: Bruce nicknamed this student ‘rugged’. He now teaches ‘the JKDgospel pure and undistorted’ at his school in San Pablo, California.Felix Macias Snr and Felix Macias Jnr: Now teach ‘the philosophical art of gungfu’ emphasizing that ‘we are not trying to exploit the teaching by turning itinto a get-rich-quick gimmick, but as a constant evolution towards personalunderstanding and excellence’.Leo Fong: Has teamed up with Joe Lewis and other Bruce Lee students to ‘moveBruce’s ideas into the new millennium’.Other Oakland students included: Bob Baker, Ernie Benevidez, Gary Cagaanan,Richard Carney, Harry Chin, Dave Cox, Tom De Laurel, Jan De Laurel, Mike Fong,Dr Lloyd Freitas, Robert Garcia, Rodney Gee, Barry Hay, Gary Hum, Allen Joe,Jerome Lai, George Lee, Greglon Yimm Lee, Moon Ling, Allen Magdangal, MarioMagdangal, Bob Marshall, Fred Meredith, Al Novak, Jimmy Ong, Stan Paisak, ManuelRodriguez, Gordon Toy, Alvin Wong, Dr Arnold Wong, Curtis Yee, Ed Kim Yee,Edward Yee, David Young, Hank Maguire and Gary Dill.Los Angeles InstituteThe third Jun Fan School opened in LA’s Chinatown district in February 1967 at628 College Street, just a few blocks from the Dodgers’ Stadium. Students thereincluded:Dan Inosanto (assistant instructor): Dan Inosanto still has a high profile inmartial arts. His own teaching is based around a core of Filipino martial artsand his finest hour was in his weapons duel with Bruce in Game of Death.Ted Wong: He was the first student to enrol at the Los Angeles school, butbecause of his natural talent he was soon invited to join the select group ofprivate and celebrity students who trained in the garden of Bruce’s house in BelAir.Jerry Poteet: Now teaches JKD ‘pure and simple, exactly like it was given tome’. Poteet coached actor Jason Scott Lee for his role in Dragon: A Life ofBruce Lee. Poteet is also the likely candidate for the ‘motion capture’ imagesused in video games featuring ‘Bruce’.Steve Golden: Works with Patrick Strong who trained at Bruce’s SeattleInstitute.Other Los Angeles students: Richard Bustillo, Dan Lee, Larry Hartsell and BobBremer all continue to teach martial arts. Further students include: BillBremer, Louis Delgado, Chuck Hill, Gary Fineman, Lee Hong, Melvin Kwan, LeoDuffin, Mike Cochrane, Herb Jackson, Pete Jacobs, Robert Lujan, HaywardNishioka, Pete Rosas and Al Wolin.Private and Celebrity StudentsDuring Bruce Lee’s time as a teacher, as acting roles arrived, he had a numberof private and celebrity students including:Kareem Abdul Jabbar: LA Lakers basketball star and co-star in Game of Death, whois considered one of the greatest players ever, famous for his unblockable‘skyhook’ shot.Steve McQueen: The movie star who Bruce vowed he’d one day surpass.James Coburn: Movie actor and probably the most serious of Bruce’s celebritystudents with a strong grounding in esotericism.Roman Polanski: Martial arts dabbler and film director who once flew Bruce toSwitzerland for a one-off lesson.Stirling Silliphant: Oscar-winning screenwriter who wrote Towering Inferno, Inthe Heat of the Night, The Poseidon Adventure and many other successful movies.Joe Hyams: Fellow screenwriter and friend of Silliphant, once married to BrittEkland.Tom Tannenbaum: Head of Paramount TV and producer of Longstreet. He laterproduced a TV special of the 1974 Karate Championships, which effectively beganthe sport of full-contact karate, and thus modern kickboxing.Mike Stone: Karate champion who used Bruce’s strategies in competition. Hebecame Elvis Presley’s karate instructor, taught him a few flashy moves, thenmade a successful move on Elvis’s wife, Priscilla.Chuck Norris: Karate champion who went on to co-star in Way of the Dragon andwas Bruce Lee’s adversary in arguably the best fight scene he ever put on film.Norris went on to enjoy a successful film and TV acting career.Bob Wall: Karate champion and co-star of Way of the Dragon and Enter the Dragon.He is a now an entrepreneur whose company, Wall Street, is based in Tarzana, CA.Joe Lewis: The most formidable karate champion of all time who used Bruce’sstrategies on his way to becoming ‘the Muhammad Ali of karate’ and who considershimself to be, at the very least, on a par with Bruce.Mito Uyehara: Editor of Black Belt magazine and publisher of Bruce Lee’sfour-volume Fighting Method. Bruce Lee named Bob Wall’s villainous character inEnter the Dragon ‘Oharra’ as a joking reference to Uyehara."},{"pageContent":" EPILOGUETHE WAY OF JEET KUNE DOA PERSONAL APPRECIATIONIn May 1994, while working in Seattle, I took the opportunity to revisit LakeView Cemetery. I found Bruce’s and Brandon’s graves situated beneath a pine treeat the crest of a hill. The area around the graves had been cordoned off so thatnobody would walk on the recently seeded lawn, so I sat a short distance away.The azalea bushes were in bright bloom and there was a warm, gentle breeze.After I’d been there a few minutes a minibus entered the cemetery gates andwound its way up the hill to stop a short distance away from where I wassitting. A bunch of people got out, babbling excitedly, and immediately begantaking photographs of each other. Each of them took their turn to climb over thecordon and pose for the cameras, trampling on the tender shoots of new grass. Afew minutes later they were all back on the bus and making their way to the nextstop on their itinerary. When the photographs were viewed later all woulddoubtless recall that they had been to Bruce Lee’s grave. It’s hard to believethat any of them had experienced actually being there.I once remarked to one of my teachers about the inscription carved into themarble bench beside Bruce’s grave: ‘THE KEY TO IMMORTALITY IS TO HAVE FIRSTLIVED A LIFE WORTH REMEMBERING’.‘No!’ he replied, forcefully. ‘That’s not quite right. The key to immortality isto remember your life at the very moment you are living it!’ Many of Bruce Lee’swords echo that truth.In an essay ‘The Tao of Gung Fu’, written in 1962, Bruce Lee wrote:Concentration in gung fu does not have the usual sense of restricting theattention to a single sense object, but is simply a quiet awareness of whateverhappens to be here and now . . . [The] mind is present everywhere because it isnowhere attached to any particular object because, even when related to thisparticular object, it does not cling to it.Let’s explore this idea further. Usually my attention is absorbed by whatever itis I happen to be doing – reading a book, watching TV, driving the car – andthis kind of automatic awareness is where we live most of the time. But if Ihappen to shut my hand in a door, for a few seconds my awareness is diverted tothe pain; this is an example of a second kind of attracted awareness, wheresomething pushes or pulls it in a specific direction. This kind of attractedawareness may also have a more emotional aspect to it: for example, I see apicture of Bruce Lee, I hear a favourite tune, my team scores a goal and myattention is engaged.But at certain times my attention can be intentionally held in one place for aperiod of time, such as studying for an exam, learning a new tune on the piano,or doing a martial art form. But even this kind of directed attention means thatI only attend to one or two things at a time.The kind of attention that we want to explore now is an open attention thatincludes everything, all at once. The word ‘consciousness’ itself means ‘knowingall together’. We are talking here of something very practical.So at the same time as one of us writes and the other one reads, I begin to turnmy attention to my body and begin to include in my awareness the physical weightof my body, and the density of my bones and flesh. I taste the inside of mymouth and feel the temperature of the air and the touch of my clothes on myskin. I can now feel any sense of energy or space, tension or relaxation. Andwithout losing this feeling and self-awareness, I might now focus on the tiniestdetail of something in front of me, like the texture of the paper in my hands,and yet still be aware of my entire surroundings, in front, to the side, aboveand below. I am aware of how my thoughts are stirred and want to follow theirown direction, or at what point in this continuing process my awareness rebels,or gets stuck, or wavers. Through this simple process of meditation I can beaware of myself in the world at large. I can now even be aware of my awarenessitself.Maybe I think that not much has changed and that this is my normal way of being,but a curious thing happens whenever anyone hears or reads about this process.As soon as I am told that I am not as aware as I could be, this in itselfgenerates enough self-consciousness for the reply, ‘Of course I’m aware ofmyself!’ But the attention soon lapses back into its more automatic or attractedstates. The reality of the wider world is only true when I make a consciouseffort and realize that at any given moment it is a completely fresh propositionthat can only be present intentionally, and not automatically.For some people, their sense of ‘I’ is located almost exclusively in the head:the body only gets any attention when something goes wrong with it. For suchpeople the body exists mainly for the purpose of carrying the head around as itgets on with the important stuff. So how much, and how intensely, do I feel thatI have a body – that I am a body. Does my awareness deliberately occupy andenergize my human form, or is it pre-occupied with all the usual concerns? Whatcan be the significance of anything that happens if I’m not fully present tomyself? Am I always preparing for the next situation? If so, will I be presentwhen it actually arrives? Will I be here and now, there and then?When a magnet is passed over a metal bar, the bar itself gradually becomesmagnetized. As every schoolchild knows, iron filings sprinkled around the barreveal the newly created magnetic field surrounding it. In the same way, if Irepeatedly pass my attention through my body, this gradually creates an energyfield whose influence may ultimately extend far beyond my ordinary way of being,into ‘a circle without limits’. And maybe even beyond the limits of time andspace.This is the meaning of the Buddha’s saying that ‘attention is the path toimmortality’. There is also a Zen saying that the hero becomes enlightened withone thought, while the lazy man ploughs his way through books and scriptures.The ‘one thought’ is the same thought as the Buddha’s. The simple process ofopening the awareness to include everything that is happening, inside and out,here and now – remembering my life at the very moment that I am living it – thisis ‘the key to immortality’ and the key to creating an energetic body ofawareness that may survive the death of the physical body.Don’t think . . . Feel!Bruce LeeThe purpose of life isn’t ‘to dare to dream’, but to awaken. Bruce Leecounselled us to expand the circle of our personal limitations into ‘a circlewithout limits’. As we know, jeet kune do applies not only to martial artpractice but to all aspects of life. From this perspective we can all beconsidered works in progress. This work is our true priority in life, and norole model, saviour or hero can do the work for us.Working on yourself doesn’t mean continually analysing or thinking aboutyourself or your life; or trying to control yourself, force yourself to dobetter or become who you are not. All of that is self-defeating. Bruce Lee says,‘Don’t think . . . Feel!’ What he means is that, rather than projecting ourideas, fears or expectations onto the world, we should enter into the world of‘choiceless awareness’ and direct experience.True seeing, in the sense of choiceless awareness, leads to new discovery andthe means to uncovering our potentiality.Bruce LeeBruce Lee often quoted an aphorism that is used in Zen schools: ‘At first acloud was just a cloud, a mountain just a mountain. When I began studying theWay, a cloud was no longer a cloud, a mountain no longer a mountain. Now Iunderstand the Way, a cloud is again just a cloud, a mountain just a mountain’.At first, the cloud and the mountain are being seen directly, but as they wouldbe seen through the eyes of a child or an animal. They are seen directly, butthey carry little meaning. But after following the Way for a time, the cloud andmountain take on symbolic values. For instance, a cloud might be compared to apassing thought, or a mountain might represent stability or endurance, and soon. Eventually, when the third stage of the process is reached, they come to beseen as more than that. Now they are again seen directly, but this time throughwiser eyes. Now they are seen as natural processes that reflect inner processesto which we were trying to give meaning in the first place. Now clouds andmountains are both real and symbolic, both symbolic and meaningful. The outerand inner worlds are connected and in tune.The baby looks at things all day without blinking. That is because his eyes arenot focused on any particular object. He goes without knowing where he is going,and stops without knowing what he is doing. He merges himself with hissurroundings and moves along with it.Chuang Tzu (quoted by Bruce Lee in his 1962 essay,‘The Tao of Gung Fu’We all had to learn to see the world in the way that we do now, as a matter ofhabit. Children simply see a tree or a building, or hear a sound the way that itis, without adding anything to it. A child simply hears a bird sing; it’s theadult who tells him that it’s a canary. From the moment that we become moreconcerned with what things are than how they are, the world stops yielding to usdirectly, because a description of it begins to stand in between, so that we nolonger see things the way they are but the way we are.The way we are taught in school is to gather facts and concepts, so that, in theend, we grow up with a very fixed and unfluid sense of how things are. This isthe problem with naming or labelling things: it makes us think of processes asthings or objects. For example, we think of a chair as an object, but at whatpoint exactly does a tree stop being a ‘tree’ and become a ‘chair’? At whatexact point in the process of cutting down a tree, shaping and assembling thepieces of wood, do we decide that it is ‘tree’ or ‘wood’ or ‘chair’, when it isessentially all the same thing shaped by time.Language is completely inadequate to describe any of this because it alwayspresents us with a linear arrangement of ideas, especially at times like this,when we are attempting to create a vision of something that exists ‘all atonce’.In atomic physics, no distinction is made between matter and energy, since theyare, in reality, two aspects of one indivisible whole.From Bruce Lee’s notes, circa 1963The everyday world that we see around us appears to be one of solid objects inempty space. But there has been a shift away from the view that matter is madeup of minute particles, to the view that the universe is understandable onlythrough its underlying, interwoven patterns of energy.In reality, there is no ultimately small particle or building block of matter inphysical terms at all. Depending on how we observe and measure them, theso-called building blocks of matter – electrons, neutrons, protons and othersub-atomic particles – also display the properties of energy waves. And just asparticles can behave in a wavelike way, so light waves can behave likeparticles, called photons. These wave particles come in packages, named ‘quanta’by the scientist Max Planck, and the term has lent its name to the new scienceof quantum physics.The physicist Jack Sarfatti describes the universe as a kind of ‘quantum foam’,where various patterns of vibration are set up. The idea that a chair is somekind of wispy fragile cloud of seething wave particles is pretty hard toappreciate when I bash my knee against it. It’s a lot easier to see that a TVpicture of a chair is formed by electromagnetic energy, but the actual woodenchair is formed in exactly the same way. Particles are like minuteconcentrations of energy that come and go like waves on an ocean. The bigger andslower the energy waves are, the denser the matter; the smaller and faster theyare, the finer the matter. Jack Sarfatti further suggests that consciousness isthe master vibration that holds all of this together, so that ‘mind’ and‘matter’ are seen only as different-sized waves in the same sea.The story of creation, whether told by present-day scientists or the Taoistphilosophers, is essentially the same. In the view of modern physics,anti-matter (yin) collides with matter (yang) to form light. Light then formsthe various energies of sound, colour and substance as some vibrations slow downand some speed up.In the Taoist concept: in the beginning is the void. Out of the void emerge thetwo fundamental aspects of creation: yin and yang. The interaction of yin andyang produces chi – energy, or vibrations – and ultimately everything inexistence. The interplay of yin and yang is a way of ordering and understandinganything that can be conceived: left and right, hard and soft, birth and death.Within any situation there may be an overall quality of yin or yang, but it canalways be further subdivided into all its complexities until there are tenthousand divisions and comparisons.To give another example, all of the words and ideas that you are reading arestored on my computer in the form of binary arithmetic, by which all informationis recorded in combinations of 0 and 1 – a further example of combining the twoto produce the many.What the Chinese call chi – and physicists might call the ‘zero-point energyfield’ – continually manifests as all of the different forms and processes thatoccur in time and space. To experience every aspect of this flow would also beto know that, ultimately, everything has the same source of arising and return,like waves rising, then falling back into the ocean. Between the beginning andthe return to the beginning there appear all the interactions of life.Bruce Lee depicted this process in a much more simple, graphic way. In theemblem of his gung fu institutes the first rank was a blank circle, the originalstate of freedom and potential a state of no‘thing’ness, from which any ‘thing’and every ‘thing’ might come into existence. The further ranks were representedby yin yang emblems of various colours, signifying every aspect of life. Thehighest grade was again the blank circle: the return to the source.Nobody wins a fight. Any victory is for the One.Bruce LeeDespite appearances, all the various forms and activities of life are really onecontinuous flow of energy at various frequencies. Knowing this, Bruce oftendismissed questions about the nature of yin and yang, not dismissing the conceptitself, but trying to point out that, in reality, all apparent opposites ariseout of one unified force. Perhaps we can now understand how Bruce Lee hadmastered his art to the degree that he could say, ‘Nobody wins a fight.’ Whatdid he mean by that? Simply that because everything arises and returns to thesame source, any victory is for this One, even before any combat takes place. Inthis way, at the highest level, the martial artist develops a ‘body feel’ foreverything in existence.At the same time that Bruce was discovering all of this, Western body-mindtherapists such as Wilhelm Reich and F. M. Alexander were also becoming awarethat the revelations of the spirit take place in the body. Awareness of postureand balance, and feelings of gracefulness or awkwardness, all serve as aconstant, accurate guide to our own psychological state. It’s interesting thatthe English word grace itself implies both an ease of movement and the descentof spiritual energy. As the I-Ching puts it, ‘By adopting a certain physicalposture, a resonant chord is struck in Spirit.’The mastery of any art transcends the art.Bruce LeeWhen movement and energy are intentionally brought into my awareness, not onlydo martial art techniques become more efficient, the whole of life is similarlyaffected. The level of the practitioner’s outer skill and the inner statereflect each other. Understood like this, every art and skill may be a way toinner development. There is a Japanese saying: ‘Archery and dancing, flowerarranging and singing, tea drinking and wrestling – it’s all the same.’ From theordinary point of view this makes no sense, but once the underlying principle isunderstood the meaning is clear.The oneness of life is a truth that can be realized.Bruce LeeWhile he was a philosophy student at Seattle’s University of Washington, BruceLee wrote an essay entitled ‘The Relationship of the Organism to itsEnvironment’, in which he explained that there is really no such state asseparateness or independence. For example: the paper this is printed on is madefrom a tree, and a tree only grows through soil, sunlight and rain. You don’thave to be a mystic to see the sun and the rain in the paper you hold in frontof you. In addition, there have been hundreds of people involved in bringingthis idea to you: the lumberjack who cut down the tree, the publishers, printersand distributors and so on. If you look deeper, you’ll see the food that gaveeveryone the energy to work and so on, all so that you can read these words,right now. If we take this process to its ultimate conclusions, we see thateverything, everywhere, is connected and related.The way I think of my ‘self’ is usually only symbolic. I can limit my sense ofself to where my skin ends, or I can extend it to my home, my career, my family,my country, my race and so on. My ‘self’ is a concept that expands or contractsat any given moment, but my felt self – the dynamic experience of my body inlife and the life in my body – knows, feels and senses that I can never beindependent so long as I eat and breathe. And even when I’m ‘dead’, my materialremains will be absorbed back into the earth, just as the traces of my spiritwill continue to affect living people, beyond the limits of the time and spaceof my life on earth.. . . Just as the spirit of Bruce Lee affects us now."},{"pageContent":" SOURCES AND READING LISTThe author gratefully acknowledges permissions to quote copyrighted materialfrom the sources listed below.
