From the outside push copper heat sensor in and tape to floor about 6” out from side keeping it away from heating pad. Make sure sensor is taped at any points that could pierce liner.

I used a ½ horse pump and a 25 Square Foot Cartridge Filter. Drill a hole in side of tank towards back end and one in front panel making sure you are below water level (water will be 9” deep). The size of the hole will be dependant on your fitting. The one I used required a larger hole in exterior and Styrofoam and a smaller hole in interior plywood. Small ring with a gasket went inside and screwed to larger fitting with gasket making a waterproof seal. If using same setup drill holes for screws before installing liner. Make sure and install a valve on both sides of pump and filter set up so you can do maintenance on filter and pump.Wire Timer switch to Panel box using a Ground Fault Interrupter(GFI) Breaker. Wire pump to timer. Install GFI plug in room for Waterbed Heater.Install Liner and screw cedar strips to wall keeping liner in place. Caulk strips and screws.

All pictures in this instruction book are from a tank that has been disassembled for quite a while so it is showing some wear. The exterior was finished in Cedar boards.

Add 800 lbs Epsom Salt (Magnesium Sulfate).3. Fill with more hot water to 9” deep.(run pump until water is clean)4. Heat water to 93.8 – 94 Degrees5. Keep buoyancy at a gravity of 1.275 to 1.30Use a hydrometer to check gravity and top up salt as needed.Use thermometer to fine tune water temperature(waterbed control might show higher or lower temperature).I run pump and filter for 15 minutes a day plus 15 minutes directly after floating.Check ph on a regular basis with inexpensive ph kit that can be purchased at spa store. Spa store will be able to provide you with information and chemical to maintain proper ph. and sanitation.Clean filter on regular basis."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Good luck and Happy Floating"}]
