One, however, proved elusive. Writtenby two brothers, Dennis and Terence McKenna, it was called The Invisiblelandscape, and it had great posthumous word of mouth. Now there's atruly heavy book, the owner of one bookstore devoted to mysticism andconsciousness told me when I queried him about it. Haven't seen one inyears. Which is about how long it took me to find my copy. In Boston. Mycry of wild exultation lifting heads all over the bookstore.The bibliophiles among you will appreciate the keen anticipation I feltas I carried it to a nearby cafe and cracked it open and discovered that, in-deed, this was a truly heavy book.Dense. Technical. Fascinating. Infuriating. Marvelously weird.Mixed in with theories drawn from the study of schizophrenia, molecu-lar biology, and ethnobotany were pungent disquisitions on shamanismand psychedelic philosophy. Plus what seemed to be a story about an en-counter with an insectoid intelligence who had curious things to say aboutthe nature of time\\ The closest thing I could compare it to was an alchemi-cal text published (in the classic period—the seventeenth century—beforethe bonds linking science and magic were severed, when it was still possibleto have a scientist magician on the order of Isaac Newton.Since that first reading, I have met the authors of The Invisible Land-scape. Though I have never seen them together, I'm told they're one of thegreat brother acts on the planet. Dennis is the scientific McKenna—theone with the doctorate in psychopharmacology—slow-spoken, factual.Terence is the quicksilver poet-philosopher McKenna. He's what I imag-ine George Bernard Shaw might have been like if Shaw had been born inthe American West in the 1940s and educated at Berkeley in the psyche-delic '60s.Cast your mind back to that milieu as you begin this book. Back tothose few months when there was a steep plunge into novelty, as TerenceMcKenna might say, that carried the most restless minds of the BabyBoom with it. Back to when the possibility that the world could be re-made sparkled in the sunshine of what will seem to be, as it recedes intohistory, a time of perpetual summer—the summer of love, of Woodstock,file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (7 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmof massive spring marches through cherry-blossomed Washington to levi-tate the Pentagon.Our appetite for simplicity has caused us to compress the chaos of the'60s into one monolithic Youth Revolt. But there were two philosophiesthen among the revolutionaries on how the world might be remade. Onepath, endorsed by the political activists, advocated a traditional Westernstrategy: seizing political power and using that vantage to raise conscious-ness and save the world. The other path proposed an attack on con-sciousness itself using a controversial and soon outlawed family ofpsychochemicals—the psychedelics.Hippies and activists. Could a society heal its social ills without firstaddressing its own internal flaws? As Tim Leary, perhaps the most cele-brated spokesman of this second option, put it: If all the Negroes andleft-wing college students in the world had Cadillacs and full control ofsociety, they would still be involved in an anthill social system unless theyopened themselves up. Opened up.There in a nutshell was the problem vis-a-vis a psychedelic politics: thesesubstances opened up much too much. They were a doorway into a uni-verse of strange and sometimes terrifying information. These were not faciletools; rather, they were an invitation to explorers, and a percentage of theBaby Boom's best and brightest responded by turning into mind wanderers,seeking adventure in the unclaimed real estate of the imagination.Such was the case with our two authors, who were convinced that thefuture of the species could best be secured through a transformation ofconsciousness.We believed that the widespread use of psychedelic drugs in mod-ern society was somehow rooted to the intuition that explorationand reassimilation of so-called magical dimensions was the nextvalid step in humanity's collective search for liberation.They focused their work on the psychedelic dimethyltryptamine, orDMT. They were curious about DMT's apparent stimulation of the lan-guage centers of the brain. Not only was glossolalia (speaking in tongues)common, but sometimes one encountered dancing molecular forms thatfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (8 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmseemed to be made out of visible language.Is it any wonder they were entranced?One day, the McKennas came across a description of the shamanicusage of the tryptamine-containing plant ayahuasca in an anthropologicalmonograph about a tribe in the upper Amazon Basin. According to theJivero shamans, ayahuasca induced a state of consciousness in which a flu-orescent violet substance was generated, and this substance allowed themto work their magic.From this apercu an expedition grew.It took years for the journey to jell, but in 1971, joined by three friends,the McKennas embarked on a trek up the Amazon to investigate theshamanic usage of such shamanic power plants as ayahuasca.None of us was yet twenty-five years old. We had been drawntogether through the political turmoil that had characterized ouryears shared in Berkeley.... We had sorted through the ideologicaloptions, and had decided to put all of our chips on the psyche-delic experience as the shortest path to the millennium, which ourpolitics had inflamed us to hope for.I'm giving nothing away by telling you that things didn't work out asplanned, that the little expedition never even reached its target village,that it was sidetracked, that they discovered instead a strange mushroom,the ingestion of which provoked the events that The Invisible Landscapeattempts to explain. They embarked upon a serious lark and ended upstumbling across the alien, the mysterious, the other. Deep in the forest. Along, long way from civilization.The complete telling of this story, which strikes me as one of the arche-typal stories of the Baby Boom generation, is contained in TerenceMcKennas True Hallucinations, a book that was composed in the fullnessof time, years after the occurrence of the events it describes. The McKen-nas' initial response, however, is in the book you now hold in your hands.file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (9 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmIn his preface to the German edition of The Invisible Landscape, DennisMcKenna says:The book was written in dead earnest by two individuals strug-gling to come to grips with a deluge of ideas triggered by a verypersonal and idiosyncratic experience. No one is more aware thanmyself that certain passages read like the musings of a naive andscientifically untutored student...Even though the passage ofnearly twenty years since these ideas were first committed to paperhave lent a certain perspective, and have made me less willing toinsist on the veracity of these concepts as revealed truth, it is stillnot an admission that is easily made.Revealed truth. What happened to the McKennas up the Amazon wasone of those sudden, shattering discontinuities that sever the recipient fromnormal time, normal experience, and usually force a complete rewriting ofone's life. Time is separated into those things that occurred before the reve-lation and those things that have come after—the aftershocks.The Invisible Landscape is the McKennas' first attempt to wrestle withthis revelation using the handholds of Western science and philosophy.They may seem to use these disciplines in an uncharacteristic and perhapsnaive way, but what strikes me more is the ingenious and sometimesbrilliantly intuitive application of these methods by two kids who wereonly in their early twenties.Nowadays, whenever some fossil starts giving me that Allan-Bloom-Closing-of-the-American -Mind-it's-all-the-fault-of-the-sixties'-generationrap, I plan to hand him The Invisible Landscape and suggest he chewthrough a few chapters before we chat further about declining standards.What these fossils would find is a book divided into three sections. Thefirst is Dennis McKennas attempt to understand the psychedelic effects ofthe mushroom revelation in neurobiological terms. Dennis was interestedin the cellular and molecular changes that accompanied the altered state,assuming that the dozens of techniques humans used to promote thesestates were just different ways of triggering the same organic process. Justdifferent roads to the top of the same mountain.file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (10 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmThe second part of the book is Terence's attempt both to understandthe mushroom revelation and to assess whether it possibly could be true.A taste of the text is in order here.We could feel the presence of some invisible hyperspatial entity, anally, which seemed to be observing and sometimes exerting influ-ence on the situation to keep us moving gently toward an experi-mental resolution of the ideas we were generating. Because of thealien nature of the tryptamine trance, its seeming accentuation ofthemes alien, insectile, and futuristic, and because of previous expe-riences with tryptamine in which insectile hallucinatory transforma-tions of human beings were observed, we were led to speculate thatthe role of the presence was somehow like that of an anthropologist,come to give humanity the keys to galactarian citizenship.This strange insectoid intelligence gently directed our authors to studythe King Wen sequence of the / Ching, which just happens to be the old-est sequence in that ancient divinatory tool. What they found there(maybe I am giving away too much of the mystery now) was a pattern, arhythm, a rhythm moving through time, maybe the key to time itself—arhythm that danced its way through the millennia toward an omega pointthat the McKennas calculated to be the year 2012.Which brings us to the third part of the book, the computer programthat describes the mathematics from which the McKennas derive thisconclusion. In the long years between the first and second editions of TheInvisible Landscape, our authors have turned their mathematical modelinto a computer program that runs on most PCs. The first time Terencedemonstrated the Timewave Zero software for me, he said something like,My God, man, what if it's true? And even if it isn't, you've still got a greatcomputer game. Perhaps you're beginning to see what I mean when I call this bookdense, technical, fascinating, infuriating. Marvelously weird.Jay StevensWeathersfield Bow, Vermontfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (11 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmPreface to the 1994 editionSomeone encountering this book for the first time is certain to find thatmany, if not most, of the ideas and concepts discussed are extremely pecu-liar. The speculations in it are so radically outside the mainstream of mod-ern scientific and philosophical thought that you may wonder whetherthis book is really meant as a sort of parody of serious scientific discourse.Let me hasten to reassure the baffled: The book you hold in your handswas written in dead earnest by two individuals struggling to come to gripswith a deluge of ideas triggered by a very personal and idiosyncratic expe-rience. No one is more aware than myself that certain passages read likethe musings of a scientifically untutored student, while others are perhapsmore indicative of the associations of an unhinged mind.Indeed, it must be admitted that both operative modes played a role inthe fashioning of the speculations which this work sets forth. Even thoughthe passage of nearly twenty years since these ideas were first committed topaper have lent a certain perspective, and have made me less willing to in-sist on the veracity of these concepts as revealed truth, it is still not an ad-mission that is easily made. I would like to think that those years havebrought with them some small degree of intellectual maturity, and per-haps a certain humility. The writing of a book which purports to explainall and everything, as this one does, is a task best left to the young, forwhom such pedestrian considerations as scientific rigor and credibility aremere impediments.Having acquired considerable formal training in both the theory andpractice of science in the interim, I now realize that even that vaunted dis-cipline may remain forever incapable of satisfactorily accounting for thesimplest, most basic elements of everyday existence: our experience of life,of mind, of being in the world. Science, by its very nature, is rendered un-comfortable when faced with such questions, because it is intrinsicallysuited to the examination of parts rather than wholes. Scientific scrutinycan unlock the minutest details of each piece of the puzzle, but more po-etic sensibilities must be called on to appreciate what it is to be a brain/mind/body experiencing the marvelous totality of being in all of itsblooming, buzzing confusion.It is in this respect that psychedelic drugs have been a major conun-file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (12 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmdrum for science, and are likely to remain so for some time. For it is inthe phenomenon of the psychedelic experience that the irrefutable, self-evident qualities of the mind come up hard against the reductionistmodels of the molecular neurobiologist. While it seems clear that themodalities of the psychedelic state must be rooted in neuronal pharm-acodynamics, explanatory paradigms couched in terms of receptor selec-tivities, structure/activity relationships, agonist/antagonist interactions,activation of limbic substructures, etc., all somehow fail to do justice tothe transcendent, transformative reality that becomes manifest when oneactually consumes a psychedelic drug.One possible approach to the resolution of this dilemma might betermed the way of the shaman: one dispenses with all attempts at reduc-tionist analysis and simply accepts the experience on its own terms, per-haps as a divine revelation from a source outside the self—a god within aplant, for instance. Indeed, the psychedelic experience is so profound andoverwhelming that even scientifically sophisticated individuals can easilysuccumb to the misperception that the trip is in the drug. The alterna-tive response, which might be characterized as the way of the alchemist, isto become utterly obsessional in the seeking of reductive explanations,and to construct wildly elaborate models in an attempt to integrate the ir-reducible reality of what is experienced into some scientific or, moreoften, quasi-scientific paradigm. This book tries, unsuccessfully perhaps,to steer a middle course between these two approaches.Nevertheless, though there is much within this work that I would nolonger attempt to defend as scientifically valid, there is also much food forthought. The intuition that led Terence and me to write The InvisibleLandscape was that the key to the brain/mind problem and perhaps manyother questions of considerable ontological significance for our species liesin a thorough understanding of the psychedelic experience, from its mole-cular mechanisms to its historical and evolutionary implications. Thatoriginal intuition has remained a valid working hypothesis to this day, andin fact has been the stimulus, at least in our lives, for most of our subse-quent intellectual development. In that time we have partially revised ourinterpretations of the precipitating causes and consequences of our experi-ences, have acquired new information, and have examined alternative hy-potheses ranging from the pharmacological to the mythical; but alwaysdriving the searching and questioning has been the desire to understandfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (13 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmthe nature of the psychedelic experience. We are, if anything, less assuredof the success of our quest today than when this book was written, but re-main convinced that any model of the brain/mind that does not reconcilethe observations of neurobiology with the fact of the psychedelic state, asit is experienced, is doomed to remain scientifically incomplete and philo-sophically unsatisfying.Psychedelic drugs have always been and remain the most useful molec-ular probes available to science for exploring the relationship between thesubjective experience of mind and neurobiological processes. Given thevalidity of this statement—and I suggest that no neuroscientist with per-sonal knowledge of the psychedelic state would contest it—one cannotfail to be puzzled by science's curious neglect of psychedelic research overthe last two decades. While it is true that in this era of government-supported science, budgetary constraints and research priorities can influ-ence which scientific problems are investigated and which are allowed tolanguish, one suspects that more than benign neglect is behind the hiatusin psychedelic research. Despite its pretensions to objectivity, science, likeany other human institution, places a certain vested interest in its ownself-preservation; thus it is likely to be less than enthusiastic, if not openlyhostile, toward any investigative strategy that could potentially call itsmost basic assumptions into question. Psychedelic drugs exert their influ-ence at the brain/mind/body interface, and are clearly well within thatshadowy and forbidden territory where cognition itself originates. Is itany wonder that science hesitates to rip that veil aside and illuminatethose shadows with the cold light of reason—knowing that reason itselfmay become the ultimate sacrifice for such audacity? It may be that thepsychedelic experience cannot be understood using only the reductionistmodels of science, and that only by a conscious unification of the reduc-tionist, analytical methods of science with the holistic, nonanalytical ap-proach of the shaman can we hope to understand, appreciate, and applythe lessons learned from such experiences. This book is a first, faltering,step in that direction.I am pleased that Terence and I again have the opportunity to make itavailable for public scrutiny, even though it is a very different work fromthe one I would write today, given the necessary time and freedom frommore immediate and pressing concerns. I urge that it be read with thisthought in mind: While there is much within these covers that wouldfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (14 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmhave to be rejected in the light of new knowledge, there is also much thatis more supported by current scientific knowledge than it was nearlytwenty years ago. Examples that could be cited include the possible holo-graphic nature of neural organization, retrograde axoplasmic transport,the possible role of superconductivity and other quantum mechanicalprocesses in living systems, the intercalation of drug molecules into nu-cleic acids, and the importance of oscillatory processes in regulating thefunctions of nucleic acids and proteins. While none of these has actuallybeen incorporated into conventional scientific dogma, they are all activeareas of experimental investigation.Scientific progress, and human understanding generally, is a self-refining, exponentially accelerating process. The past two decades havewitnessed advances in scientific understanding that were scarcely imag-ined when this book was written. It seems virtually certain that scienceand human thinking will experience an even more radical transformationover the next two decades. Ironically, the speculations in this book may re-semble the result of that scientific and noetic (r)evolution more than theunquestioned paradigms of current scientific knowledge.Dennis J.

And it will be about nineteen years until the denouementthat will surely be the acid test for this series of psychedelically inspiredspeculations. I have long struggled to maintain a suspended judgment onthese matters, yet I'm also aware that if nothing at all comes of this extra-ordinary intellectual adventure, it will be a rather ironic comment on theidea that nature does nothing in vain.I believe that The Invisible Landscape remains our magnum opus, andthat it is monumental in its ambition to build a new system that integratesall nature—animate, inanimate, social, and psychological—into onemathematically coherent web of interconnected and evolving resonances.The 1975 edition was small and its readership widely scattered. I hopethe evolution of scientific thinking and the new resurgence of interest inshamanism and the use of psychotropic plants will contribute to an intel-lectual climate in which the ideas of The Invisible Landscape will be fairlyexamined and considered by a wider audience. My faith that the ideas ex-plored here will be found to have an extraordinary explanatory and per-suasive power remains unshaken. As for Truth, I will argue today—as Idid in 1971 at La Chorrera—that these ideas are, in Wittgenstein's won-derful phrase, True enough.

Inthe name of drawing near to this liberation, humankind has built and thenpartially rejected an endless procession of societies, governments, philoso-phies, and religions. The understanding of what form this liberation mighttake has been in a constant state of refinement, often, if not always, evolv-ing at cross purposes to itself, creating again and again situations whereinsystems in violent competition, and seemingly antithetical to each other,sought the same goal—a goal always reducible to this complex idea, libera-tion. Systems as divergent as Buddhism and Marxism, National Socialismand Christianity, have all claimed possession of a set of concepts thatwould in some sense free their practitioners. The entire human experi-ence, individual and collective, can be described as the pursuit of thatwhich frees.It has not been a search without success; it may be said that althoughprogress is erratic, nevertheless each successive age has expanded our under-standing of the nature of being and freedom. Monotheism, as it developedin the West, freed early humans from the nearly complete domination ofconsciousness by the pan-vitalistic animism seen everywhere resident inNature. The coming of Christianity freed its adherents from the fear of awrathful and paternalistic god. Similarly, the modern era offered freedomfrom the dogmatic stasis of late medieval Catholicism. It may be arguedthat each of these events, rather than advancing humans along the path to-ward liberation, had quite the opposite effect, and, in fact, each step downthe path of history has led deeper into time and away from the paradise inillo tempore. However, viewed objectively, the historical process may be seenas the expansion of cross-cultural contacts between various peoples and aresultant sharing of a continuously growing pool of information, ideas,and myths. This body of inherited and shared information represents ourcollective understanding of the nature of our species' conscious journeythrough time. As such, each new epoch, each new religion or philosophy,however much it may appear to erode the search for liberation in its ownright, as an addition to the racial collectivity of conscious information,represents advance. Although our entire being is caught up in the pursuitfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (20 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmof liberation, we share no collective understanding of what this liberationmight be. The search is reflected on all levels within our species and is in-tensely present in each of us as individuals. Whether Marxist or mystic,each of us pursues those threads of thought that seem, subject to our ownuniqueness, to be fruitful in leading to this liberation.The personal response to this situation by the authors of this book hasbeen to follow the nostalgia for paradise through a survey of the ideasassociated with shamanism and pharmacology, with frequent forays intoapparently distant fields.During 1970 our thinking coalesced to a point where we felt that abasic reconstitution of culture, while theoretically possible through an ar-chaic holo-cybernetic revolution, was practically impossible, given the in-transigence of power elites and the lack of direction evinced by putativerevolutionaries. Our interest then centered upon primitive societies wherea connection with the timeless world of the unconscious is maintainedthrough the office of the shaman, the technician of the sacred. We be-lieved that the widespread use of psychedelic drugs in modern society wassomehow rooted to the intuition that exploration and reassimilation of so-called magical dimensions was the next valid step in humanity's collectivesearch for liberation. Our studies centered upon tribal peoples who had ahighly refined tradition of shamanism and the use of psychotropic sub-stances. Practical experience indicated that entry into the separate reality or the nonordinary reality of the shamanic cosmology was most easilyachieved through the use of hallucinogenic tryptamines. To investigatethis assumption, we organized, early in 1971, an expedition to the UpperAmazon Basin to locate sources of organic tryptamines and to explore theirpossible relevance to the search for liberation into eschatological time.Our intuition was that the physical interaction of mind and brain, andits potential for manipulation through hallucinogenic drugs, might pro-vide a situation where new and radical experimental approaches couldshed light on problems still largely unelucidated, problems such as therelation of metabolism to mind and the molecular nature of memory andrecall. We hoped to create a model of mind and its parameters that wouldbe neither reductionist nor exclusive of paranormal phenomena. Indeed,in the institution of shamanism we felt that the normal and the paranor-file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (21 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmmal were somehow merged, and in the shamanic world, physical mani-pulation of psychic space via hallucinogens is raised to the level ofscience —more precisely of a folk science. We assumed that the mergingof the normal and the paranormal and the use of hallucinogens were di-rectly related. Unlike most researchers, we did not seek to reduce theparanormal aspects of the shamans world to mere psychologisms; instead,we set out with the open-ended premise that in matters as mysterious asthe nature of mind, surprises might well be in store. We sought to experi-ence shamanic phenomena on whatever level of existential validity theycould present themselves. We were not wrong in anticipating that whatwe would encounter would leave our own culture-bound categories se-verely strained. This book attempts to present the assumptions that led usto the Amazon and to describe our research there.We assumed that mind and life are rooted in a bioelectronic field phe-nomenon, since a corpse is similar to a living body except for the latter'sbioelectronic continuum of energy exchange and metabolism. We hopedto understand the mechanics of the mutual interrelatedness of mind andthe organic matrix at formative submolecular junctures. If, as we postu-late, mind and its contents, both conscious and unconscious, reside some-where in the structure or dynamics of the genetic matrix, then it would beuseful to seek a means of enhancing access to those portions of the geneticapparatus where the unconscious mind, both personal and collective,may be seated. As is common knowledge, numerous techniques of mindexpansion, from drugs to yoga, have been devised to make unconsciousportions of the mind available for conscious contemplation. Nearly all ofthese seem to involve the induction of some biophysical alteration of thecondition of the organism, and it is likely that the change at the cellularand molecular level is the same whatever the technique employed. If, in-deed, some molecular mechanism is capable of unlocking the realms ofthe personal and collective unconscious, then the understanding and ap-plication of such a process would be of tremendous benefit in the searchfor human liberation. Our own understanding of our Amazon experiencesis that they seem, however cryptically, to argue strongly that the liberationwhose attainment is the very motivation of conscious life is a more tangi-ble thing than we had thought possible.It will be useful, for purposes of clarification, to divide the work inwhich we were engaged at La Chorrera into three categories, which canfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (22 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmthen be discussed independently of each other—though certainly in ourown subjective experience, during the experiment and since, these categor-ies have tended to migrate toward each other, leading, as we anticipated, toan understanding that seems to hover at the very edge of language whilebeing clearly rooted in the sphere of cognition. We have thought it reason-able to attempt to discuss this work on three levels, made only as distinctas is necessary for its comprehension, and understanding further that inour subjective experience, these levels were not distinct at all. These cate-gories may be thought of as (1) the actual biophysical experiment, (2) thesubjective psychological experience triggered by the experiment, and (3)the continuum graphs of the evolution of change in space-time that are theobjective content derived from our attempts to investigate the bioelec-tronic constellation of mind. These graphs seem to imply a possible eco-logical crisis within the community of species that may make access to theshamanic dimension a fact of historical fatedness of unique importancefor humankind.Before these categories can be usefully discussed, some of the principlesand methodological assumptions that provided an investigative set of toolsfor these shamanic researches will be discussed.Any sort of investigative procedure, whether it be the analysis of thephysical world or the exploration of interior realms, is accomplishedthrough the application of some methodology, which in turn is foundedon philosophical premises. More often than not, the philosophical as-sumptions entailed in the practice of science are not made explicit; thehypothesis and experimental procedures and results are presented withoutarticulating the philosophical bias underlying them. Our investigationsare concerned with explicating the nature of mind, ideas, and conscious-ness concepts, which, by their very elusiveness, demand the constructionof philosophical postulates. The chapters in Part One are devoted to anexposition of the philosophical and operational biases that influenced andguided our investigations. Chapter 1 focuses on the traditional figure ofthe shaman as he is found in primitive societies, while chapter 2 presentsa comparison of the shaman and the schizophrenic. The shaman and theschizophrenic both seem to possess a greater access to unconscious pro-cesses than the normal individual. While the schizophrenic is spontane-ously inundated and often overwhelmed by these processes, the shaman,through the practice of his techniques of ecstasy, is able to integratefile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (23 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmthem into consciousness and to maintain access to them without suffer-ing personality disintegration. If some fundamentally similar molecularprocess is responsible for the release of unconscious contents in each case,then the figure of the shaman is worthy of close study for his ability totrigger and control this process.Because the temptation to treat the concept of mind in vague and ill-defined terms is a powerful one, chapters 3 and 4 attempt to delineate ourunderstanding of the nature of mind. Chapter 3 itself deals with somemethodological and philosophical assumptions of science that must bemade explicit if science is to address the complex phenomenon of mind. Analternative metaphysic, consistent with a quantum mechanical understand-ing of mind at its primary levels, is advanced as the basis for a scientificmethodology able to pursue an experimental and empirical investigationof mind. The ontological premises outlined in chapter 3 do not arise denovo from the substratum of individualistic speculation; on the contrary,they are based on the process-oriented organismic philosophical tradi-tion that finds its most eloquent expression in the thought of Alfred NorthWhitehead. The metaphysical and philosophical concepts presented inthis chapter will, accordingly, closely reflect some central themes of White-head's thought. Chapter 4 finds in the properties of holography new prin-ciples of organization that provide useful models for understanding thestructure of both brain and mind. Chapter 5 enlarges upon the discussionof brain-mind organization and advances a tentative hypothesis of neuro-transmitter and drug activity that attempts to explain how higher corticalexperience could be modulated at the molecular level. Chapter 6 describesthe procedures and results of our experimental attempt to expand thescope of consciousness through manipulation of the biophysical state ofthe human organism. The final chapter in Part One deals with our per-sonal and subjective reaction to the experiment at La Chorrera.The Figure of the ShamanOf all the diverse religious institutions that humans have elaborated sincebefore the beginning of recorded history, that of shamanism is one of themost singular and is probably one of the most archaic as well. The sha-man is something of a maverick among religious practitioners. Whilefile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (24 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmshamanism occurs in virtually every culture on the planet, manifestingitself in religious traditions both ancient and modern, both primitive and sophisticated, the shaman remains eminently individualistic, idiosyn-cratic, and enigmatic, standing ever apart from organized ecclesiastical in-stitutions while still performing important functions for the psychic andreligious life of the culture. Comparable, but not identical, with such sim-ilar idiosyncratic practitioners as medicine men and sorcerers, the shamanis the possessor of techniques of proven efficacy and of powers borderingon the paranormal, the complete understanding of which still eludesmodern psychology. It is this complex and fascinating figure of the sha-man that we want to analyze from a standpoint at once sympathetic, in-terpretative, and psychological, with a view to answering the followingquestions: (1) What are the traditional aspects of shamanism as it is en-countered in primitive cultures? (2) What is the nature of the shamanicpersonality and abilities, and what is the psychological role of the shamanin the society at large? And (3) Are there institutions analogous to sha-manism in modern society?The vocation of shaman is found in nearly all archaic cultures, fromthe Australian aborigines to the Jivaro Indians of central Ecuador andPeru to the Yakut tribes of Siberia. It is believed to have originated amongthese Siberian peoples, though its diffusion into other cultures must havetaken place very early in prehistory for, along with sorcerers, magicians,and priests, shamanism can be counted among the oldest of professions.The word shaman is derived from the Tungusic term saman, derivedin its turn from the Pali samana, indicating a possibly Southern (Bud-dhist) influence among these northern peoples (Eliade 1964, p. 4951). Eli-ade distinguishes the shaman from other types of religious and magicalpractitioners primarily on the basis of his religious function and tech-niques: . . . he is believed to cure, like all doctors, and to perform mira-cles of the fakir, like all magicians, whether primitive or modern. Butbeyond this, he is a psychopomp, and he may also be priest, mystic, andpoet. He further defines the shaman as a manipulator of the sacred,whose main function is to induce ecstasy in a society where ecstasy is theprime religious experience. Thus, the shaman is a master of ecstasy, andthe art of shamanizing is a technique of ecstasy (Eliade 1964, p. 4).In archaic societies, a person (either man or woman) may become afile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (25 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmshaman in primarily one of two ways: hereditary transmission or sponta-neous election. In either case, the novice shaman must undergo an initia-tory ordeal before he can attain the status of a full shaman. The initiationgenerally has two aspects: an ecstatic aspect, which takes place in dreamsor trance, and a traditional aspect, in which the shaman is given instruc-tion in certain techniques, such as the use and significance of the sha-manic costume and drum, the secret spirit language, the names of thehelping spirits, techniques of curing, the uses of medicinal plants, and soon, by an elder master shaman. These traditional techniques of shaman-ism are not invariably transmitted by an elder shaman but may be im-parted to the neophyte directly through the spirits that come to himduring his initiatory ecstasy. Lack of a public ritual in no way implies thatsuch traditional instruction is neglected.The ecstatic part of the shaman's initiation is harder to analyze, for itdepends on a certain receptivity to states of trance and ecstasy on the partof the novice: He may be moody, somewhat frail and sickly, predisposedto solitude, and may perhaps have fits of epilepsy or catatonia, or someother psychological aberrance (though not always, as some writers on thesubject have asserted [cf. Eliade 1964, pp. 23ff. and below]). In any case,his psychological predisposition to ecstasy forms only the starting pointfor his initiation: The novice, after a history of psychosomatic illness orpsychological aberration that may be more or less intense, will at lastbegin to undergo initiatory sickness and trance; he will lie as though deador in deep sleep for days on end. During this time, he is approached indreams by his helping spirits and may receive instructions from them. In-variably during this prolonged trance the novice will undergo an episodeof mystical death and resurrection: He may see himself reduced to a skele-ton and then clothed with new flesh; or he may see himself boiled in a cal-dron, devoured by the spirits, and then made whole again; or he mayimagine himself being operated on by the spirits, his organs removed andreplaced with magical stones, and then sewn up again.Although the particular motifs may vary between cultures and even in-dividuals, the general symbolism is clear: The novice shaman undergoes asymbolic death and resurrection, which is understood as a radical transfor-mation into a superhuman condition. Henceforth, the shaman enjoys ac-cess to the supernatural plane; he is a master of ecstasy, can travel in thespirit-realm at will, can cure and divine, can touch red-hot iron with im-file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (26 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmpunity, and so on. In short, the shaman is transformed from a profane intoa sacred state of being. Not only has he effected his own cure through thismystical transmutation, he is now invested with the power of the sacred,and hence can cure others as well. It is of the first order of importance toremember this, that the shaman is not merely a sick man, or a madman; heis a sick man who has healed himself, who is cured, and who mustshamanize to remain cured. Lommel (1967) gives the following descriptionof a shamanic initiation in Siberia:The Tungus say of their shamans: Before a man becomes a sha-man he is sick for a long time. His understanding becomes con-fused. The shamanistic ancestors of his clan come, hack him tobits, tear him apart, cut his flesh in pieces, drink his blood. Theycut off his head and throw it in the oven, in which various ironappurtenances of his costume are made red-hot and then forged.This cutting up is carried out somewhere in the upper world bythe shaman ancestors. He alone receives the gift of shamanhoodwho has shaman ancestors in his clan, who pass it on from genera-tion to generation; and only when these have cut up his body andexamined his bones can he begin to shamanize. (p. 65)We have noted that the function of shamanic initiation in the primitivesociety is to effect the transformation of the shaman from a profane,human condition to a superhuman, sacred one. But while the shamanmay carry out activities such as divining and prophesying, and occasion-ally sorcery, these are not his major functions, and often fall within theprovince of other types of practitioners. The shaman's primary functionsare those of healer and psychopomp. This is related to the specific natureof the shamanic ecstasy; not all forms of mystical ecstasy are shamanic, forthis, like initiation, has its own peculiar nature. The shamanic ecstasy isone in which the shaman is supposed to leave his physical body and jour-ney to the Center of the World, which connects the earthly realm with thecelestial world above and the infernal regions below. This axis mundi maybe symbolized as a tree, mountain, tent pole, ladder, liana, or somethingsimilar; the shaman is able to make the journey and return safely becausehe is a master of ecstasy and possesses the guidance of helping spirits alongthe way. His main functions thus become either guiding the soul of a de-ceased person to its home in the infernal or celestial realms or journeyingto those realms for the purpose of retrieving the soul of a sick personfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (27 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htm(which has wandered off by itself or been stolen by the spirits while thepatient was asleep), returning with it, and restoring it to the patient'sbody. The shaman thus fulfills his functions by being able to travel in thesupernatural realm, and he is enabled to do this because he is a master ofecstasy.From the description of the shaman's duties in the community, we candraw some obvious conclusions and make some further hermeneuticalspeculations as to the shamanic function within the cultural context. Thecuring function of shamanism, as well as such secondary functions as div-ination and prophecy, show clearly that the shaman, like all magical prac-titioners, helps a primitive culture to come to terms with environmentalforces that are both nurturing and threatening. Thus, through the sha-manic propitiation of the spirits, good crops or fruitful hunting can be as-sured; drought, epidemic, or other natural disasters can be averted. Onthe deeper level of collective psychology, we can perceive several functionsof the shaman that would not be articulated by the members of a givensociety, but that, nevertheless, are intrinsic to the shamanic function.Lommel (1967) says of the social role of the shaman:. . . primitive man is quite exceptionally susceptible to variousforms of mental disorder. Psychoses, neuroses, hallucinations,mass hysteria and the like are of very frequent occurrence. Theshaman can cure these states—but only when he has overcomethem in himself. . . . the shaman is the center, the brain and thesoul of a (primitive) community. He is, so to speak, the regulatorof the soul of a group or tribe, and his function is to adjust, avert,and heal defects, vacillations, disturbances of this soul. Looked atbiologically, the whole life of primitive people is more stronglyinfluenced by the subconscious than seems to be the case amongourselves. It is clear that in this situation the position of the sha-man is one of paramount importance. (p. 73)The shaman is able to act as an intermediary between the society andthe supernatural, or to put it in Jungian terms, he is an intermediary to thecollective unconscious. Through the office of the shaman, the society atlarge is brought into close and frequent encounter with the numinous ar-chetypal symbols of the collective unconscious. These symbols retain theirnuminosity, immediacy, and reality for the society through their constantreaffirmation in shamanic ritual and through the shaman's epic narration ofmythical scenarios and his artistic production. The shaman does more,file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (28 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmhowever, than just recite the myths or express the religious symbolism inmaking ritual artifacts; the shaman lives the myth. By virtue of his superhu-man, transformed state, he enacts the role of the mythical hero: He can flythrough the air, talk to the gods, see everywhere, understand the animals,and perform other feats characteristic of a semidivine entity. Thus, the sha-man is the exemplar in the present epoch, which is regarded by primitivesas a profane, historical time, of the condition supposed to have been acces-sible to all humans before the fall (cf. Eliade 19 61, chapter 2). In his ecstasythe shaman reenters that mythical, paradisiacal condition that existed be-fore the fall and thus reasserts, for the entire culture, the reality of thatmythical time. Thus, the validity of the archetypal motifs, which presum-ably describe the human condition in the paradisiacal era, is reaffirmed.The shamanic function also includes a psychoanalytic capability. Thatthe shaman can cure illnesses of a psychological or psychosomatic natureis well established. The shaman is undoubtedly, perhaps essentially, adoctor—but the factual medical knowledge of the primitives is very small;the shaman's medical function seems to be confined to psychological, per-haps psychoanalytical techniques, and his successes fall mainly within thepsychological domain (Lommel 1967, p. 25). By what exact mechanismhe is able to do this is not completely understood. It is as though the sha-man, in his capacity of ecstatic psychopomp, practices a participation ther-apy of the most sophisticated type; by means of his ecstatic capacity, theshaman plunges into the collective unconscious and restores the patient'sself-identity (equivalent to finding his soul ) by taking onto himself theunconscious contents that have inundated the patient through the princi-ple of transference (cf. Jung 1954). Because this is accomplished in the con-text of ritual, which is real and numinous to the participants, the shaman'stask is doubtless somewhat easier than that of a modern psychoanalystwho is often faced with a demythologized, rationally hardened personality.The shaman, then, acts as a doctor of the soul, both the individual andthe collective soul, and he is also a real and living exemplar of the primor-dial, mythical human condition, and in being so maintains the reality andimmediacy of the sacred. He is able to carry out these functions becausehe is master of the techniques of ecstasy, and it is by virtue of this that hemaintains his suprahuman state.It is clear that the practice of shamanism, to a greater extent than otherreligious offices, depends on the unique personality of the shaman. Thismust account in part for the great diversity of preinitiatory traits that con-file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (29 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmstitute a shamanic election as well as the diversity in methods of shaman-izing, in the means employed to produce ecstasy, and in the motifs of theshaman's journey, not only in different cultures but between individuals aswell. With this in mind, let us lift the shaman out of his cultural contextfor a moment and focus on the characteristics of his psychological makeup.An item of the first order in addressing ourselves to this psychologicalexamination of the phenomenon is the question of the psychopathologi-cal nature of the shamanic personality. There are, as we have noted, certaincases where the symptoms leading to shamanic initiation can be traced toa condition of mental illness, epilepsy, or catatonia; however, this is by nomeans true for all such cases, as some have claimed. Initiation can also betriggered by an encounter with a magical animal, the finding of a magicalstone or other object, or an ordeal in the wilderness.Eliade (1967) masterfully points out where such theories have goneastray:The problem, in our view, has been wrongly stated. In the firstplace, it is not correct to say that shamans are, or must always be,neuropaths; on the contrary, a great many of them are perfectlysound in mind. Moreover, those who had previously been ill havebecome shamans just because they succeeded in getting well [italicshis]. Very often, when the vocation reveals itself in the courseof an illness or an attack of epilepsy, the initiation is also a cure.The acquisition of the shamanic gifts indeed presupposes the reso-lution of the psychic crisis brought on by the first signs of thisvocation. The initiation is manifested by—among other things—a new psychic integration. (p. 77)And, similarly, Nadel (1946) states:And here it is important to stress that neither epilepsy nor insan-ity, nor yet other minor mental derangements, are in themselvesregarded as symptoms of spirit possession. They are diseases,abnormal disorders, not supernatural qualification. No shamanis, in everyday life, an abnormal individual, a neurotic or a para-noiac; if he were, he would be classed as a lunatic, not respected asa priest. Nor finally can shamanism be correlated with incipient orfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (30 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmlatent abnormality; I recorded no case of a shaman whose profes-sional hysteria deteriorated into serious mental disorders. (p. 36)From these comments, it is apparent that shamanism is not an institu-tion designed to capitalize on psychological aberrations.We shall return to the question of the stability of the shamanic person-ality in the next chapter, where we will consider the similarities betweenthe self-cure of the shaman and the attempt to resolve a life-crisis thatcharacterizes essential schizophrenia.Let us now consider the shamanic trance itself. All of the shaman'sfunctions, his ability to cure, divine, converse with the spirits, and travelin the supernatural realm, depend on his ecstasy; were he unable to attainecstasy at will, he could not be a true shaman. Thus, the human will em-ploy certain means for achieving ecstasy, which may be frenzied and pro-longed drumming, dancing, and chanting, sleep deprivation, fasting, andso on. These techniques are not dissimilar to the self-flagellation and as-ceticism practiced by certain Christian mystics. In addition to these tech-niques and often in conjunction with them, the shaman will employcertain narcotic plants, such as the drinking of tobacco juice or the inhala-tion of hashish smoke. While Eliade (1964, pp. 22of, 223, 4oo., 477) as-serts that the use of narcotic substances as an aid to ecstasy invariablyindicates a decadence or vulgarization of the shamanic tradition, there isreason to doubt this (cf. Wasson 1971, pp. 326-334). On the contrary, theuse of narcotic plants as an adjunct to shamanism is widespread and oc-curs in every region of the globe where the plants occur. The importantrole of the hallucinogenic mushroom Amanita muscaria in Siberian sha-manism has been exhaustively documented by Wasson, and the incrediblycomplete narcotic technology of New World Indians has been examinedby Schultes (Schultes and Hofmann 1973) at length. From this evidence itappears that the narcotic experience and the shamanic experience are, invery numerous cases, one and the same, though the narcotic experiencemust be molded and directed by the symbolic motifs of ritual to give it itspeculiarly shamanic quality.It is our contention, to be amplified in later chapters, that the presenceof psychoactive substances is a primary requirement for all true shamanism,and that where such substances are not exogenously available as plants,they must be endogenously available, either through metabolic predispo-file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (31 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmsition to their synthesis, as may occur in schizophrenia, or through thevarious techniques of shamanism: dancing, drumming, singing, and theconfrontation of situations of stress and isolation. Where these alkaloidsare not present, shamanism becomes ritual alone, and its effectiveness suf-fers accordingly. We hope to show that because of the biophysical rolesthese compounds play at a molecular level, they are the operational andphysical keys allowing access to the powers claimed by the shaman.One of the most interesting, and least understood, aspects of the sha-manic personality centers upon the question of paranormal powers; theshaman is supposed to be a master of fire and psychic heat, is thought tobe clairvoyant, clairaudiant, and telepathic. Further instances are given byEliade (1967):From among the best-observed cases, let us recall those of clair-voyance and thought-reading among the shamans of Tonga,recorded by Shirokogorov; some strange cases of prophetic clair-voyance in dreams among the Pygmies, as well as cases of thediscovery of thieves with the aid of a magic mirror; some veryconcrete instances concerning the results of the chase, also aidedby a mirror; examples of the understanding, among these samePygmies, of unknown languages; cases of clairvoyance amongthe Zulus; and lastly—attested by a number of authors, and bydocuments that guarantee its authenticity—the collective cere-mony of firewalking in Fiji. (p. 8yf.)There is herein a fruitful and untapped subject for parapsychology. Theactual occurrence of such phenomena, in at least some instances, is beyondquestion and suggests that the radical reorganization of the psychic facul-ties, which shamanic initiation is supposed to produce, does have some va-lidity beyond the merely symbolical; the shaman actually is superhuman insome little-understood manner. Our later speculations will center on apossible biophysical mechanism for this transformation. What is interest-ing, and also supports the assertion that these phenomena are real, is theiressential similarity to paranormal powers encountered in other religioustraditions. Such motifs as magical flight, psychic heat, and immunity tohot coals, for instance, are found in the yogic techniques of Buddhism andHinduism (Eliade 1967, pp. 89ff.). The ability to perform such magicalfeats, in both the shamanic and the yogic traditions, simply reconfirms theontological mode associated with such practitioners; they have transcendedfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (32 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmthe human condition and now participate in the condition of the spirits. Let us now focus our attention on a more speculative question: whetherthere are, or could be, institutions in modern society that draw their mod-els from shamanism. There appears to be occurring in modern life a pro-gressive alienation from the numinous archetypal contents of the collectiveunconscious, which has engendered a gradually encroaching sense of col-lective despair and anxiety. The archetypal motifs of the Western religioustradition seem to have lost their effectiveness for the larger portion of civi-lized humanity or, at best, have been depotentiated to the level of a merelypsychological reality. Western humans have lost their sense of unity withthe cosmos and with the transcendent mystery within themselves. Modernscience has given us a picture of human beings as accidental products ofrandom evolutionary processes in a universe that is itself without purposeor meaning. This alienation of modern humans from the numinous groundof their beings has engendered the existentialist ethic and the contempo-rary preoccupation with the immediate historical situation. Humans areregarded as leading a wholly profane existence within a wholly profanetime, that is, within history; the reality of the sacred is denied or reducedto the level of psychology.In non-Western cultures, in primitive cultures particularly, humansare not conscious of living in historical time, but regard themselves asinhabiting a numinous sacral time (cf. Eliade 1959). If these humans areconscious of history at all, it is of a mythical, paradigmatic history, a para-disiacal epoch that lies beyond the attritional influence of profane time.From the point of view of religious symbolism, this preoccupation of mod-ern humanity with its historical and existential situation springs from anunconscious sense of its impending end.It is in this unenviable position, then, that we find the modern temper:anguished by the imminence of death, yet trapped in profane, historicaltime and thus able to regard death only as nothingness; the saving pres-ence of a sacred, transcendent mode of being is absent from the contem-porary worldview. Thus modern humans stand today at the very edge ofthe abyss of death and nothingness, and it is precisely here that one canperceive a useful role for a modern shamanism. Again there is a need for adoctor of the soul, a figure who can bring humankind into close and fruit-ful confrontation with the collective unconscious, the creative matrix ofall that we are and have ever been.file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (33 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmNaturally, the modern shaman will have to search for means of fulfill-ing his psychopompic functions, which are different from the relativelystraightforward ritualistic techniques of his predecessor. One of the mostpotentially effective of such means lies in his artistic and poetic capacities;the soul of modern humanity is still open to influence by aesthetic means.Hence one of the first places we should look for signs of a modern sha-manism is in the artistic sphere. The shamanic role of the artist in moderncultures extends not only to his work, but to his very life. Through ma-nipulation of his physical medium, the artist seeks to express his personalvision of reality—a vision arising from the roots of the unconscious andnot dependent upon public consensus, in fact, often actively opposed toit. More than that, the artist exemplifies in his life a freedom that is simi-lar to the superhuman freedom of the shaman.Although it is not too difficult to recognize the role of the artist in themodern world as being in some sense shamanic, it is perhaps more diffi-cult to understand our second nomination for a contemporary counter-part to the shamanic practitioner, the scientific researcher. Eliade (1967)has pointed out that scientists are the creators and keepers of a new myth-ology of matter. Indeed, the scientist who charts the unexplored levels oforganization to be found in nature, from the bizarre, paradoxical realms ofquantum physics to the staggering vastness of the metagalaxy, has much incommon with the shaman who journeys through the magical topographyof the spirit-world.One area of modern life that does not appear to be shamanic, but thatmight profitably model itself after shamanism, is psychoanalysis. A mod-ern soul doctor might well achieve better results if he or she could modeltherapy after a psychopompic journey through the collective unconscious.The exact techniques would, of course, have to be adapted to modern pa-tients, but where the unconscious is concerned, all people are primitive. One approach to such a shamanic psychoanalysis could be through thecontrolled and judicious use of psychotropic drugs; knowledge of both thepromises and dangers of such agents has increased tremendously in recentyears, as has understanding of the role they play in shamanism. A combi-nation of knowledge and wisdom in applying their properties could verywell give an effective and harmless technique of ecstasy that could beusefully employed in psychoanalysis (cf. Naranjo 1973).file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (34 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmWith this we conclude our preliminary discussion of shamanism. Thebackground that we have laid down, our discussion of the shaman's tradi-tional role in archaic societies, our examination of his singular personality,abilities, and techniques have been skeletal at best. Our speculation onshamanism and modern society is likewise incomplete and intentionallyso; we sought only to make the point that the numinous motifs of sha-manism can have a relevance to modern humans, and doubtless there areinstances of this that have not been mentioned. If we are to draw a conclu-sion as to how we can profit from the study of shamanism, it is this: Per-haps, through understanding the fascinating and alien figure of theshaman, we can draw somewhat nearer to that numinous, archetypal, liv-ing mystery that dwells within each of us.Chapter 2Shamans and SchizophreniaThe question of just how much of the human experience of the supernat-ural stems from mental aberrance or experiences during trance or intoxi-cation has intrigued anthropologists and psychologists for a number ofyears. In the preceding chapter we discussed the characteristics of shaman-ism, one of the most archaic of religious technologies. We now want toshow that significant similarities exist between shamanic election and ini-tiation and the effort at psychic reorganization that characterizes someforms of schizophrenia. If, as we proposed earlier, the mind and its buriedunconscious contents have their origin at some submolecular interface,then it is reasonable to suggest that a similar biophysical release mecha-nism is responsible for the irruption of these contents in both shamanismand schizophrenia. Comparison of the two syndromes could be useful forwhat it might reveal, not only about the processes that trigger access tosuch unconscious material but also about the means of controlling theseprocesses. Whereas schizophrenia may or may not result in eventual con-trol of the nonordinary experience and psychic reintegration, in shaman-ism this step is, nevertheless, a sine qua non.The primary difficulty in formulating any definition of mental aber-rance in general and schizophrenia in particular is that any such definitionwill necessarily reflect the cultural bias out of which it is formed. Behaviorconsidered abnormal or pathological in one culture may be quite congru-ent with the norms of another. Belief in witchcraft might be indicative offile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (35 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmparanoid delusion in one culture but might represent a prevailing view inanother.For our purposes, abnormal behavior can be defined as behavior differ-ing from the accepted cultural standard as a result of an inner conflict orcrisis in the life of the individual, regardless of the standard of normativebehavior in the society in which the life-crisis occurs. One of the basic dis-tinctions between normal and abnormal behavior lies not in the outwardmanifestations of the conflict, but in differing cultural attitudes towardthe life-crisis and its resolution.The term schizophrenia is used to denote a number of heterogeneous,but related, disorders usually characterized by withdrawal from the envi-ronment and preoccupation with interior processes, attended by a resul-tant disintegration of the personality. An early term for schizophrenia wasDementia Praecox, meaning an intense pathological state beginning early inlife. In 1896 the psychologist Kraepelin classified schizophrenia into threesubtypes and ascribed organic, endogenous causes to each type. Later, afourth type, known as simple schizophrenia, was added to this classifica-tion and its cause adduced to be a crisis in an individual's life situation.Boisen (1936) lists the following subtypes of schizophrenia (in Boisen'sterms, dementia praecox), first noting that . . . findings have indicatedthat it is important to distinguish dementia praecox as a way of life fromdementia praecox as an attempt at reorganization [italics his] (p. 314): (1)Simple schizophrenia, represented by the individual who drifts off into aworld of fantasy and easy pleasure-taking without putting up any resis-tance. This type of schizophrenia is classed as denoting a way of life. (2)Paranoic schizophrenia, characterized by an individual's inability to admitdefeat or error and a resulting distortion of beliefs to save the conceptionof the individual's relation to the external world on which his psychicstructure is based. This type also represents a way of life. (3) Catatonicschizophrenia represents a desperate attempt at reorganization followingupon an awareness of danger. Catatonic disturbances often take on theform of stupor or excitement and may be looked on as more severe formsof the anxiety neurosis. They bear a close relationship to certain types ofreligious conversion experiences. (4) Hebephrenic schizophrenia repre-sents the terminal stage of the drifting reaction or demoralization thatmay follow upon an unsuccessful attempt at reorganization. Speech tendsfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (36 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmto lose logical sequence, and the individual becomes silly, uninhibited,and indecent and tends to have bizarre ideas.Silverman (1967) lists as clinical symptoms of schizophrenia: (1) anunmistakable change in personality, (2) autism—nonreality-oriented idea-tion, (3) disturbances of perception, (4) disturbances of thinking, (5) pro-found emotional upheavals, and (6) bizarre forms of behavior. He makesfour classifications of significance for our study under the general headingof schizophrenia,, based on Sullivan's classification (Silverman 1967). Thefirst is process schizophrenia, in which the personality is poorly inte-grated; there is continuous and prolonged development of schizophrenicsymptoms, and prognosis is poor. It is ... the congeries of signs andsymptoms pertaining to an organic, degenerative disease usually of insidi-ous development (Sullivan 1953). Reactive schizophrenia, on the otherhand, ... is primarily a disorder of living . . . the person concerned be-comes schizophrenic—as one episode in his career among others—for sit-uational reasons and more or less abruptly (Sullivan 1953). Under thereactive schizophrenic category, Silverman differentiates between essen-tial schizophrenia, in which . . . the profoundest of emotional upheavalsand . . . religious and magical ideation unfold under conditions of markedenvironmental detachment, and paranoid schizophrenia, in which... the patient, caught up in the spread of meaning, magic, and tran-scendental forces, suddenly 'understands' it all as the work of some otherconcrete person or persons . . . attention is thereafter focused primarilyupon environmental events and people. Silverman goes on to say of es-sential types that they ... evidence an overtly indifferent orientation tounfamiliar stimuli, a reduced attentiveness to the environment, and atendency to attenuate the experienced intensity of environmental stimula-tion, whereas he characterizes the paranoid type as one who is overtlyresponsive to unfamiliar stimulation, extensively scans the environ-ment . . . and evidences a tendency to augment the experienced intensityof environmental input (Silverman 1967, pp. 22-23).Both the shamanic initiation and the inwardly directed essential formof schizophrenia reflect an attempt at psychic reorganization as a means ofresolving an inner conflict or crisis in the life of the individual. The non-paranoid type of schizophrenia bears the most favorable prognosis for aneventual working through of the inner conflict, resulting in a reintegrated,healed personality:file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (37 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmIt is as if the paranoid schizophrenic, unable to comprehend ortolerate the stark terrors of his inner world, prematurely redirectshis attention to the outside world. In this type of abortive crisissolution, the inner chaos is not, so to speak, worked through or isnot capable of being worked through. Since the working throughof the inner-world experience turns out to be a primary concern. . . (both for the shaman and for the schizophrenic), the para-noid schizophrenic resolution is considered to be an incompleteone, and the essential, nonparanoid schizophrenic form is there-fore regarded as more comparable to that of the shaman, thehealed madman. (Silverman 1967)The onset of essential schizophrenia usually begins with the magnifica-tion of some unresolved conflict in the individual's life, perhaps a poor sex-ual adjustment or deficiencies in social relationships, which is apt to giverise to intense feelings of impotence, failure, or personal incompetence tothe extent that self-concern may so overwhelm the personality that theschizophrenic becomes aware of little else. The schizophrenic syndromemay end at this point if the individual is successful in attaining some sortof personality reorganization and resolution of the precipitating conflict.The patient may then return to normal, sometimes improved but oftenwith a seriously damaged self-esteem.More often, however, the sense of estrangement and isolation is fol-lowed by an ever more marked narrowing of attention to the external envi-ronment, increased absorption in interior fantasy, and withdrawal from theoutside world. Sustained constriction of the field of attention under theseconditions also results in a state of self-initiated sensory deprivation, withconsequent inevitable difficulty in the differentiation of fantasy and non-fantasy, between hallucination and perception (Silverman 1967, p. 24). Inthis and later stages, auditory and tactile hallucinations may manifestthemselves; the patient often hears voices or engages in conversation withimaginary companions and also may experience distortions of body-image,the sensation of dying or of the body being cut up, disintegrating, or melt-ing. Often the patient falls under the compulsion to obey the imperative ofthe voices and may engage in irrational, sometimes symbolic and ritualis-tic, actions or gestures (Boisen 1942). This stage is tantamount to the stagethat Silverman terms fusing of higher and lower referential process, inwhichfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (38 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmthe already unstable and weakened psychological self is disorga-nized by this drastically altered environment and is inundated bylower order referential processes such as occur in dreams or revery.Owing to the depths of the emotional stirring that triggered thewhole process, the world comes to be experienced as filled withsupernatural forces and profound but unimaginable meaning.(Silverman 1967, p. 24)In Boisen's (1942) words:It is known as the inspiration or the automatism, and maybe defined as the idea or thought process which after a periodof incubation darts suddenly into consciousness . . . they seemto him entirely different from anything he had ever thought ordreamed before. He assumes therefore that they must come froma superhuman source. (p. 25)The fifth stage—what Silverman calls the cognitive reorganization —occurs when the schizophrenic succeeds in reintegrating his personalityand assimilating the new unconscious contents to which he has gained ac-cess. This stage constitutes the main difference between essential andparanoid schizophrenia, in that it is conspicuously lacking in the latter. Itmay be said to represent a cure, not in the sense that the schizophrenichenceforth returns to normal and is no longer bothered by autonomousunconscious contents, but rather in that he manages to integrate thesecontents into the sphere of consciousness and learns to cope with the ex-panded reality in which he now must live. This stage may develop to anypoint, from a very marginal adjustment accompanied by constant relapsesto an extremely pronounced state of mental acuity in which awareness,sensitivity, and creative capacity are likely to be many times greater thanin normal individuals, as if entire areas of the brain, previously inaccessi-ble, had been opened up by the transforming experience. The schizo-phrenic who has managed successfully to complete this final adjustment isin every sense superior, for he is truly a healed madman, one who notonly has crossed over to the other side but has returned and hence pos-sesses access to both spheres of reality.Up to this point we have examined the phenomenon of schizophreniafile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (39 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmin its successive stages, from its onset to its resolution. We must nowsearch for correlations between this most severe of mental aberrances andthe motifs encountered in shamanism, the revered and respected archaictechniques of ecstasy that occupy a central position in the religious life oftribal peoples.The criteria that define the vocation of shaman are many and variedthroughout the world, and it is certainly untrue that every shaman mustbe a schizoid personality. We have observed that the shaman is usuallyconsidered a healed one and that he gains shamanic status because hehas healed himself; but the crisis for which he works out a resolution isnot always a mental disorder and, in some cases where it is, it is not alwaysa schizophrenic type of aberrance. The shaman's call or election mayarise from a purely physical malady, the spirits making their desire that hebecome a shaman known to him during a feverish delirium. Still otherforms of shamanic election may arise from an accident in the externalworld, such as being struck by lightning or being bitten by a snake. In in-stances where mental aberrance is a factor in shamanic vocation, a predis-position to epileptic or cataleptic seizures, to hysteria or anxiety, may bethe underlying cause rather than schizophrenia. But whatever the under-lying cause of the shaman's election, it is important to constantly keep inmind that it is the ability to cure that is the real basis of the shamanicstatus:. . . we must also consider the fact that the shamanic initiationproper includes not only an ecstatic experience but... a course oftheoretical and practical instruction. . . . Whether they still are orare not subject to real attacks of epilepsy or hysteria, shamans, sor-cerers, and medicine men in general cannot be regarded as merelysick; their psychopathic experience has a theoretical content, forif they have cured themselves and are able to cure others, it is,among other things, because they know the mechanism, or rather,the theory of illness. (Eliade 1964, p. 32)In a significant number of cases, however, it is possible to discover im-portant similarities between certain elements of shamanic initiation andthe motifs associated with progressive schizophrenic disintegration. Nowlet's return once again to the stages of essential schizophrenic onset, thistime to uncover similarities between these stages and those associated withfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (40 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmthe shamanic election and initiation.The onset of schizophrenia usually arises at the time of some basic life-crisis, when the individual is likely to experience feelings of guilt, im-potence, or incompetence in a life situation culturally acknowledged ascrucial. We find that this is also true in many cases of shamanism; in addi-tion to being introverted and of a nervous constitution since childhood,the future shaman often receives his vocational call through accident, sick-ness, familial misfortune, or similar mishap. Thus, we may infer that incultures where the shamanic institution exists, an individual may chooseto restructure his life and become a shaman as a means of resolving a life-crisis.The second stage of schizophrenic withdrawal is manifested by a senseof isolation and estrangement from ordinary cultural concerns, whichmay be followed or accompanied by a pathological fixation on certainideas, events, or objects purportedly imbued with some sort of supernat-ural significance. This is also found in shamanism; initiatory seclusion ofthe shamanic candidate is common among many tribes, and this is sym-bolic of the shaman's psychic isolation, for ... the medicine man standsapart from the world of the profane precisely because he has more directrelations with the sacred and manipulates its manifestations more effec-tively (Eliade 1964, p. 31). In this and later stages, the schizophrenic orshaman may develop a fixed ideation on a narrow circle of significantideas, omens, or objects, often becoming so intense as to result in sleeploss or autohypnosis. The boundaries between sleeping and waking breakdown, and the novice shaman lives in a twilight world of hypnagogic fan-tasy and half-waking reverie.The principle behind the induction of autohypnosis is one of per-ceptual fixation, and some of its behavioral manifestations arepresent in the pathological staring of schizophrenics or noviceshamans or in the total attentiveness of certain shamans to theirfrenzied, prolonged drum-beating or whistling. (Silverman 1967,p. 26)This acute constriction of the field of attention brings about a state ofself-initiated sensory deprivation. Experiments with sensory deprivationat McGill University (Nordland, in Edsman 1967, pp. 170ff.) have shownfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (41 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmthat in this state, visual and auditory hallucinations and perceptual distor-tions are common, with subjects often hearing voices, seeing imaginarypeople, and having sensations of body-image distortion. All of these man-ifestations can be found to a marked degree in shamanism. The shaman issaid to make a journey, during which he is spoken to by the spirits, whogive him curing instructions and make their wishes known for certainkinds of propitiatory sacrifices; they may also appear to him in the form ofvisions or apparitions. Motifs of death and rebirth, often involving bodilydismemberment and reassimilation, are common in shamanism, as Eliade(1964) illustrates:. . . both spontaneous vocation and the quest for initiation involve... a more or less symbolical ritual of mystical death, sometimessuggested by a dismemberment of the body and renewal of theorgans . . . equivalent to re-entering the womb of this primordiallife, that is, to a complete renewal, to a mystical rebirth. (pp. 53,63ff.)In both schizophrenia and shamanism, this is followed by a fusion oflower referential processes with higher, so that the mind is inundated by aflood of archaic imagery that seems to come from outside sources; in sha-manism, this stage is typical of the fully manifested trance.The fact that they are entirely different from anything previouslyexperienced lends support to the assumption that they have comefrom the realm of the supernatural. One feels oneself to bedwelling among the mysterious and the uncanny. Ideas of worldcatastrophe, of cosmic importance, and of mission abound.Words, thoughts, and dreams can easily be seen to reside in exter-nal objects. Causal relationships are perceived against a back-ground of magic and animism. (Silverman 1967, p. 28)The difference between the shaman and the schizophrenic must besought in the degree of cultural acceptance of this lower-order referentialcontent. The altered perception of reality into which this newly openedregion of cognition plunges the schizophrenic has, in modern societies, nocultural validity.The last stage in the progression, that of cognitive reorganization tofile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (42 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmcope with the altered perception in which the individual now lives, is forthe shaman and for the schizophrenic much the same thing—the arduoustask of learning to use the altered perception to good advantage, for cre-ative endeavor and increased sensitivity. An important difference, how-ever, is that in our culture the schizophrenic is forced to work out hisadjustment without the benefit of culturally sanctioned attitudes of accep-tance for the expanded reality that he now inhabits, whereas in primitivesociety not only is the shaman in possession of an elaborate body of tradi-tional teachings regarding his illness, but his adjustment is made mucheasier by virtue of his accepted and respected social position.The shaman must indeed be possessed of a superior flexibility and con-stitution, for not only must he attend to the needs of his patients in thisworld but he must also satisfy his spirits in the other. He is the technicianof the numinous par excellence, and his vocation is a demanding one,consisting as it does of maintaining a constant equilibrium between ordi-nary reality and the supernatural realm. The shaman's psychic life is notunlike the unnaturally dexterous dances he performs at the height of hisecstasy; it is a constant balancing act, as though he were a psychic tight-rope walker on the razor's edge between the external world and the bi-zarre, magical, often terrifying world within. However, one of the major differences between shamans and schizo-phrenics appears to lie in the cultural attitudes with which they are re-garded, and this disparity is perhaps deserving of some comment.Lommel (1967) says of shamanism as a possible cure technique:The way out of the situation lies in shamanizing; that is to say, themental sickness can be healed only if the sufferer accepts the oftenunwanted and feared office of shaman, which the spirits are forc-ing upon him. We gain the impression that early man has foundan almost unfailing way of curing mental disease, that a certainpsychic constitution makes escape from a pathological state pos-sible. (p. 53)The suggestion that we wish to infer from Lommel's observation is thatperhaps, in literate cultures, the schizophrenic is the victim of a culturallymisdirected attitude. It seems reasonable to suggest that in our culture theschizophrenic provides a necessary pipeline to the collective unconscious,file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (43 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmjust as the shaman does in tribal societies. The spiritual atrophying ofcontemporary culture may be due in large measure to its loss of sensitivityto processes in the collective unconscious. A reinstitution of the shamanicrole in modern society might prevent its total estrangement from the col-lective unconscious, which remains the fountainhead of all human cul-tures, archaic or modern.CHAPTER 3 - Organismic ThoughtThe progress of science is, like all other creative activities of human intel-ligence, a groping toward pattern—toward the accumulation of assignedpattern for the coordination of observed details and toward the uncover-ing of novel pattern and the consequent introduction of novel details.This tendency toward synthesis, toward the apprehension of ever morecomplex and inclusive orders of pattern, appears to be a fundamentalquality of human thought. It is characteristic of aesthetics, philosophy,and religion, as well as of science. Understanding consists of the assimila-tion of patterns encountered in the external world, and insofar as under-standing progresses, it is the assimilation of novel forms of pattern and themodification of previously perceived patterns that such novel patterns in-troduce. One of the chief resistances to this progressive penetration of un-derstanding is the dogmatic tendency to adhere to orthodox modes ofassigned pattern when confronted with novel details that call for a re-ordering of understanding. In the case of science, one can point to thepersistence, in our conceptual models, of the Newtonian doctrine of con-crete material entities possessing the properties of simple location; where-as the order of pattern revealed by quantum physics allows for neitherconcrete endurance nor simple location at its most basic levels. On theopposite end of the scale, one can point to the doctrine of relativity, whichhas shown that space and time must be regarded as properties of eachother, yet one generally continues to characterize space in terms of the re-lationships of Euclidean geometry on any scale short of the cosmic. Stillanother example can be cited in the scientific assumption of the suffi-ciency of purely physicochemical properties to explain the fact of livingorganisms and, by extension, the fact of mind.To carry on its empirical investigations, science must embark on thismethodological license of abstracting certain sets of facts from the totalityof patterned relationships of which those facts are a part. As long as theseassumptions are understood for what they are, as a set of ad hoc hypothe-file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (44 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmses employed for the purpose of characterizing a given phenomenon, thatis, purely for the sake of methodological convenience, then science en-counters no difficulty. It is when science proclaims the adequacy of agiven order of pattern to characterize all levels of organization that it runsinto philosophical difficulties, for then it extends the methodological ab-stractions used to characterize a phenomenon to sets of phenomena thatmay in actuality exhibit patterns of a quite different order. It is to thephilosophical consequences of this methodological inconsistency of sci-ence that this chapter is addressed. We intend to examine in some detailthe philosophical problems raised by scientific methodology; we will at-tempt finally to tentatively suggest the fundamentals of a metaphysics thatis consistent not only with the pursuit of scientific abstraction but alsowith the apprehension of the world as it impinges on us as living, sensing,minded organisms.Alfred North Whitehead, in Science and the Modern World (1967, p. 7),states: Every philosophy is tinged with the coloring of some secret imagi-native background, which never emerges explicitly into its chains of rea-soning. For science this intuitive speculation consists in its assumption ofthe knowability of the world, in its belief that every event can be corre-lated with its antecedents in a definite manner exemplifying general prin-ciples. This assumption, that in nature there is a secret, and that thatsecret can be unveiled, forms the unconscious metaphysical assumptionbehind all research. This scientific faith was not the creation of science it-self but was inherited from the insistence of Greek and Scholastic philoso-phy on the rational order of nature, on the belief that nature conductsitself according to inexorable, orderly laws. This view in Greek cosmologyis found in the conception that all things in nature tend toward a definiteand proper end; while in Scholastic philosophy, it is reflected in the in-stinctive tone of faith centered upon the rationality and scrutability ofGod. Every detail of nature was conceived as supervised and ordered; thesearch into nature could only vindicate the faith of centuries. Though thetacit philosophical creed of science is embodied in these antecedent ratio-nal traditions, the way was paved for the rise of science itself by a turnaway from theoretical contemplation toward an interest in nature for itsown sake, the observation of concrete, irreducible facts. In this aspect,modern science arose out of a reaction against the abstract rationalism ofScholasticism. What could not be demonstrated, what was not apparentto observation, was inadmissible as evidence in the scientific worldview.file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (45 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmAnd yet the belief that the diversity of irreducible and stubborn facts washarmonizable into an intelligible, rational order arose not as a result ofempirical observation, but out of faith in the order of nature.In the light of these mixed origins of modern science—its instinctivebelief in the rationality of nature, coupled with its insistence on the obser-vation of irreducible facts—it is interesting to consider the role of induc-tion in science. When one observes, one also selects; a pure observationdeals only with a particular set of conditions giving rise to a particularphenomenon. When one extrapolates the particular observation to thewhole set of phenomena exemplifying similar conditions, this is induc-tion. An entire class of phenomena has been characterized on the basis ofa limited sampling of such phenomena. By this process of induction, sci-ence thus arrives at a formulation of general conditions that characterizenot only the particular entity or occasion under investigation but also anyother real or theorized occasion or entity that satisfies the postulated gen-eral conditions. This process of framing abstract postulates that bear a ref-erence to no particular occasion or entity (and, in consequence, enters intothe description of all such occasions) reaches its height in mathematics.The characterization of number, for example, five, does not depend onwhether you are referring to five apples or five minutes; it can be impar-tially applied to either, regardless of the intrinsic differences of apples andminutes. Pure mathematics exists in the realm of pure abstraction; all itasserts is that reason insists that if any entities whatsoever have any rela-tions that satisfy such-and-such purely abstract conditions, then they musthave other relations that satisfy other purely abstract conditions.To the extent that science seeks to explain the mechanism of physicalphenomena with mathematically expressible laws, it reduces the data ofconcrete observation in particular events to the status of pure abstrac-tions. The abstractions existed antecedently to the physical phenomenathey were found to describe. The complex of ideas surrounding the peri-odic functions had to be worked out, as pure mathematical theory, beforetheir relations to such physical phenomena as the motion of a pendulum,the movements of the planets, and the physical properties of a vibratingstring could be discerned. The point is that as mathematics became moreabstract, it acquired an ever-increasing practical application to diverseconcrete phenomena. Thus, abstraction, characterized by numerical oper-ations, became the dominant conceptual mode used to describe concretefile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (46 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmfacts.In the process of induction, one extrapolates given characteristics of aparticular past; one does not extrapolate general laws except on the basisof an assumed rationality of nature. The introduction of mathematicsinto the scheme supplies the nature of the data to be searched for in obser-vation, namely, measurable quantities. In physics, this emphasis on mea-surable elements reached its satisfaction in the Newtonian concepts ofmass and force. Mass was conceived as a constant property inherent in allmaterial bodies in measurable amounts, whether that body was at rest orin motion, and that remained inherent in the body from one moment tothe next, for as long as the body endured. Force was defined as mass timesacceleration, and hence refers primarily to bodies in motion. It is impor-tant for our purposes to note that there is in these laws the tacit assump-tion of the self-identity of a material body in both space and time; a bodyis the same body whether it is at point A or point B or any point betweenthem. Similarly, the body remains fully itself in its transitions throughtime and at any instant, however short, of time. The material is said tohave the property of simple location; that is, it can be said to be definitelyhere in space and here in time, without reference to any other region ofspace or time. But this notion raises difficulties for induction, for if in thelocation of configurations of matter through a stretch of time there is noinherent reference to any other times, past or future, it immediately fol-lows that nature at any period does not refer to nature at any other period.Accordingly, induction is not based on anything that is inherent in nature.The order of nature cannot be justified by the mere observation of nature,for there is nothing in the present fact that inherently refers to either thepast or the future.This doctrine of simple location has a further consequence for sciencein that it explains physical phenomena in terms of the interaction of ma-terial entities in space. To the scientific mind of the seventeenth century,physical phenomena, including the phenomenon of a living organism,were understood as a manifestation of the interaction of material entities;the world consisted of physical bodies having mass, location, and locomo-tion, such entities having these properties as essential qualities. But otherqualities exist, which normally enter into observations of a phenomenon,but which are suppressed by the purely physical description that admitsonly of mass, location, and motion. We refer to such secondary qualitiesfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (47 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmas color, or roundness, or scent, or texture. These qualities were not con-sidered inherent in the entities themselves, but as arising out of our appre-hension of phenomena and having no existence apart from apprehension.Such qualities were in fact considered to be products of the mind alone:. . . But the mind in apprehending also experiences sensationswhich, properly speaking, are qualities of the mind alone. Thesesensations are projected by the mind so as to clothe appropriatebodies in external nature. Thus the bodies are perceived aswith qualities which in reality do not belong to them, qualitieswhich in fact are purely the offspring of the mind. Thus naturegets credit which should in truth be reserved for ourselves: therose for its scent: the nightingale for his song: the sun for hisradiance. The poets are entirely mistaken. They should addresstheir lyrics to themselves, and should turn them into odes ofself-congratulation on the excellency of the human mind. Natureis a dull affair, soundless, scentless, colourless; merely the hurryingof material, endlessly, meaninglessly.However you disguise it, this is the practical outcome of thecharacteristic scientific philosophy which closed the seventeenthcentury. (Whitehead 1967, p. 54)This abstraction of the secondary qualities from the primary ones ofphysical bodies had the unfortunate effect of creating a dualism betweenmind and nature. Nature became identified with matter and its move-ment, whereas mind, believing, suffering, perceiving, but not interfering,was conceived as existing apart from the external nature that it observed,described, and measured. Yet to the extent that mind is in nature, it is aproduct of nature. Mind is a quality proceeding from living organisms,and organisms are regarded by mechanist science as arising from the blindinteractions of undirected matter; both life and mind become in this viewsimply the outcome of the random interactions of matter over a vast scaleof time. Any apparent meaning to this process, any type of evolutionaryadvancement or value or purpose, is simply a projection of the observer;in itself, nature is intrinsically blind, without purpose, meaning, or value.This was the philosophical paradox that modern science, based on induc-tive abstraction, led itself into: confronted with a universe both lifelessand devoid of mind, how to explain the apparent intelligibility of naturefile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (48 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmand the fact of living organisms.The preceding discussion has tried to point out that in science certainaxiomatic, a priori assumptions accompany any exercise of scientificmethodologies. Though we have by no means exhausted the list of suchassumptions, we have hopefully pointed to some of the major ones: theimplicit faith in the knowability and the rationality of nature, a legacy toscience of Greek metaphysics and medieval Scholasticism; the utilizationby science of the inductive method, and the twofold assumption of thisuse—that observation of representative concrete phenomena can lead tothe formulation of abstract, general laws, and the assumption of the rele-vance of past events to present and future events; the assumption of thesufficiency of interactions of material entities having simple location ingiving rise to nature, and proceeding from this assumption, the exclusionof mind as a causative factor in the universe, and the consequent exclu-sion of value and teleology from nature. That science makes these as-sumptions in the exercise of its methodology is not our criticism; they arenecessary for the pragmatic practice of science. In the absence of suchself-imposed limitation, the practice of science would be impossible. Ourcriticism is that these assumptions are not made explicitly, with the un-derstanding that, of course, they are philosophically arguable; they aremade merely in the service of methodological convenience. Instead, inthe greater number of cases, no attempt at philosophical justification ismade; the tacit assumptions of science are left unstated, to be inferred bythe philosopher. Because the methods of science work, because they canproduce results, science feels no need to concern itself with philosophy.The progress of science in recent years, that is, primarily since the turnof the century, has unlocked vast new areas to human understanding. Ithas revealed novel orders of pattern in nature that not only went unde-tected and unsuspected by the science of an earlier day but also have ne-cessitated almost the complete restructuring of the scientific worldview.We have in mind such discoveries as relativity, with its non-Euclideantopology, and quantum theory, with its notion of the discontinuous na-ture of matter and energy. Yet, in the face of these novel orders of pattern,whose explication was spearheaded by scientific methodology itself, otherareas of science, not concerned directly with investigating such areas, havecontinued to carry the burden of outmoded, false conceptions as intrinsiccomponents of their epistemological equipment.file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (49 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmIn the following section of this chapter, let us focus attention on onearea of classical scientific assumption, the notion of materialism, and seein what ways this notion finds itself in need of revision in the light ofmodern quantum theory. Then let us apply our revised concepts to thosetwo stumbling blocks of classical materialism, organism and mind, to seeif we have come any distance toward framing a set of epistemologicalprinciples that are both supportive of scientific investigation and truer toour everyday apprehension of the world.One approach to the quantum theory can be found in the assumptionthat an electron does not continuously traverse its path in space, but in-stead appears at discrete positions in space for successive durations of time:It is as though an automobile, moving at the average rate of thirtymiles an hour along a road, did not traverse the road continuously;but appeared successively at the successive milestones, remainingfor two minutes at each milestone . . .But now a problem is handed over to the philosophers. Thisdiscontinuous existence in space, thus assigned to electrons, isvery unlike the continuous existence of material entities which wehabitually assume as obvious. The electron seems to be borrowingthe character which some people have assigned to the Mahatmasof Tibet. These electrons, with the correlative protons, are nowconceived as being the fundamental entities out of which thematerial bodies of ordinary experience are composed. Accordingly,if this explanation is allowed, we have to revise all our notions ofthe ultimate character of material existence. For when we pene-trate to these final entities, this startling discontinuity of spatialexistence discloses itself. (Whitehead 1967, pp. 34—35)The problem can be overcome if we accord to matter the same vibra-tory character that we apply to light and sound. The adoption of this vi-bratory picture of matter is going to necessitate the drastic revision of ourideas of simple location. One recalls that a unit of matter having simplelocation does not require a given period of time in which to manifest itsessential identity—it is fully itself even if the period of its endurance issubdivided indefinitely. Similarly, subdividing the space of the materialfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (50 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmentity does divide the volume, but its elements are conceived to retaintheir essential spatial continuity. Note that in this view the passage oftime is conceived of as accidental, rather than essential; that is, the pas-sage of time has nothing to do with the character of the material. If weadopt the vibratory description of matter urged by quantum theory, timebecomes of the essence of the material. In an analogous way, as a note ofmusic is nothing at any instant, but requires its whole period in which tomanifest itself, so the vibratory entity of a primordial unit of matter re-quires a definite period of time, however small, for the expression of itsessential nature. Another consequence arises as well: Quantum theorytells us that the electron, the basic unit of matter, does not have continu-ous spatial existence, but discrete points of manifestation (quanta) inspace. Now, at first sight, this view seems much less in congruence withour everyday experience than the old classical notion of simple location inspace. After all, we perceive all around us objects that seem to have conti-nuity both in space and in time; are we then to believe that such appar-ently solid entities are actually vibratory processes? That such a view isactually more true to experience, in that it opens the way to explain thoseother commonsense elements of experience, organisms and minds, wewill try to show next. However, one feature of the quantum view can beimmediately pointed out; that is, that matter ceases to have simple loca-tion, mass, and locomotion as primary qualities; these become as refer-ent to the synthesis of a perceiver as such secondary qualities as color,texture, or noisiness. Thus, either matter no more has primary qualitiesthan it does secondary qualities and is in itself without quality, or the sec-ondary qualities are just as real as the primary ones and are there to beperceived by the mind.Thus, in the quantum view, the notion of material entities having form,a discrete and fixed spatial configuration, and endurance, a continuous sus-tenance through time, yields to the notion of process, a dynamical act ofcontinuously evolving becoming. Material entities assume the characterof an event; apart from process, there is no being. A thing is what it is byvirtue of the serial unfolding of pattern through time; if one attempts toisolate an object at a single, nontemporal instant, apart from the instantspreceding and following it, the object loses its essential identity. The objectrequires a self-defined, indivisible epoch for its realization; its reality isdefined by the unity of the various processes that enter into its makeup. Itfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (51 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmis the process of unfoldment of the various components of an entity, gath-ered into a prehensive unity, that we experience as the sense object; it is notthe components themselves that we experience as the sense object, but ourunified prehension of these unfolding components. Thus, nature becomesa structure of evolving processes, and space and time the locus of the unifi-cation of these processes into sense objects. It is ridiculous, therefore, to askif color is less real than, say, spatial location; color is one ingredient in theprocess of realization; it enters into the unified prehension of an event, andapart from prehension, there is no realization.There is a further consequence derivative of this notion of nature as aunity of processes. This is that the modal ingression (realization) of anevent into space-time bears a relation to past events, to contemporaryevents, and to future events. An event in itself is a unity of processes, butin combination with other events, past or present or future or all three,the event becomes one process in the unity of a still larger event. Thus themode of ingression of any given event is subject to the influence of its an-tecedents, its contemporaries, and its descendants, which are in turn in-fluenced by still other events, and so on. The unity of process that is anevent therefore incorporates the influence of all events; each event mirrorswithin itself every other event. Insofar as a given event is considered apartfrom other events, which participate in its unity in making it just thatevent and no other, our understanding of the event remains incomplete.The total unity of an event can only be understood with reference to thetotality of process, that is, to the whole of nature. Thus, in this view, a wayis cleared not only for the implicit reference to past events to be found inthe formulation of scientific laws but for our own psychological unity ofmemory, immediate realization, and anticipation.Let us see if this definition of an entity as an evolving process can shedlight on the problem of organisms. One recalls that an entity is a unityof processes requiring a given, indivisible span of time, or epoch, for its re-alization. The duration of an epoch can vary for different entities, de-pending on the complexity and number of processes entering into theirrealization. An electron or a mu-meson require a very short epoch fortheir realization, on the order of picoseconds; a mayfly requires a some-what longer epoch, on the order of forty-eight hours; a human or an ele-phant require an epoch of fifty to a hundred years for their realization,while a universe requires an epoch on the order of tens of billions of years.file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (52 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmThe point is that each of these entities requires its full epoch to realize it-self as a unified totality of process. Its full identity as a realized actualitydepends on its full epoch of evolving becoming. It is nothing at any oneof its instants; it is itself only when taken in its unified totality of succes-sive instants.Thus, identity, for any actual entity, consists of a unity of ongoingprocess, a unity that incorporates into its present aspect conditioning in-fluences of its past and the anticipation of its future. In a living organism,this immediate experience of ongoing process becomes identifiable withits notion of self; that is, its awareness of itself, its selfhood, becomessynonymous with its experience of dynamical process. To clarify this, letus state what the selfhood of an organism does not consist of. Selfhooddoes not consist of its identification with the material bodily components,for its material components are continually being effaced and replacedwith others by the process of metabolism:. . . the material parts of which the organism consists at a giveninstant are to the penetrating observer only temporary, passingcontents whose joint material identity does not co-incide with theidentity of the whole which they enter and leave, and which sus-tains its own identity by the very act of foreign matter passingthrough its spatial system, the living form. It is never the samematerially and yet persists as its same self by not remaining thesame matter. Once it really becomes the same with the samenessof its material contents—if any two time slices of it become, asto their individual contents, identical with each other and withthe slices between them—it ceases to live; it dies. . . (H. Jonas1966, pp. 75-76)We see, then, that for the organism not only does identity persist inmaterial change but it depends on this material flux. This is what is meantby the statement that its selfhood is derived from its experience of itself asa process. Its self-awareness does not apply to a material structure, but toan event-structure. The event-structure, the process in question, is thepersistence and development of bodily form in the face of material flux.For in the case of living organisms, form is not determined by materialsubstrate:file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (53 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htm. . . viewed from the dynamic identity of the living form, thereverse holds: the changing material contents are states of its en-during identity, their multiplicity marking the range of its effec-tive unity. In fact, instead of saying that the living form is aregion of transit for matter, it would be truer to say that thematerial contents in their succession are phases of transit forthe self-continuation of the form. (Jonas 1966, p. 80)Thus, the selfhood of the organism is identified with the dynamicalpersistence of form, a process.It can be seen, then, that organisms exhibit an outward orientation to-ward a twofold transcendent horizon: toward the horizon of the outerworld as the source of material for the sustenance of its form and towardthe horizon of the future into which it is ever on the verge of extending byits existence as a continuous process of becoming. But life also must becharacterized by an internal horizon, a self-integrating identity of thewhole, spanning the succession of ever-vanishing substrata. There is noway of inferring this internal horizon from external characterization alone;it must derive from our own immediate experience of the organic mode ofbeing. But it is the only way by which the self-integrative persistence of ametabolizing organism can be explained. The mode of realization of aninorganic entity can be explained by its external relations alone, but thepersisting self-identity calls for forms of process transcending mere exter-nal relations.Thus, the self-integrative persistence of the special form of process thatis an organism is characterized by an internal horizon that is indicative ofits possessing the quality of mind. Therefore, any view of the organismicprocess that strives for completeness must take account of mind as a factorentering into the process. If, then, mind is an element of the total processcomprising an organism, is it possible to explain the fact of organismswithout reference to the influence of mind? This amounts to saying, doesmind enter into the organism as a causative element in its existence, or isthis merely attributable to physical interactions? One can see that sincethe states of mind do enter into the total plan of the organism, it followsthat it affects each subordinate component of the process, until the small-est subordinate components, for instance electrons, are affected:file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (54 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmThus an electron within a living body is different from an electronoutside it, by reason of the plan of the body; the electron blindlyruns either within or without the body; but it runs within thebody in accordance with its character within the body; that is tosay, in accordance with the general plan of the body, and this planincludes the mental state. (Whitehead 1967, p. 79)We have been examining heretofore some of the methodological as-sumptions of science and have found, particularly with reference to theclassical notion of material, that many of these assumptions have a limitedapplication. The notion of material entities having simple location andindefinite temporal divisibility, while apparently congruous with (some)aspects of our daily experience, turns out to have the character of an ab-straction when our observations focus on the minutest levels of submolec-ular organization. We have found the characterization of material entitiesas vibratory epochal processes to be more consistent with the discoveriesof quantum mechanics and have found that this model also opens the wayto the explanation of organisms and mind.Perhaps we have arrived, then, at a point where we can suggest a basicreformulation of the metaphysical basis of science. This suggestion is, first,that science consider the event as the ultimate unit of natural occurrence,and second, that in seeking to analyze the component elements of anevent, it should look for primary organisms rather than material parts. Forthere is in nature virtually nothing that exhibits the classical attributes of amaterial; nature is a process of processes, and processes within processes.Accordingly, the analysis of nature should concern itself with the analysisof aggregate processes into primary processes. Biology is concerned withthe larger processes that are organisms, whereas physics concerns the smallerprocesses, which are likewise organisms, in that they experience a referenceto things past, immediate, and future. For the primary organisms, we ob-serve this relation as a factor in its external aspects; for ourselves, we ob-serve it as an element of our psychological field of awareness. But if weexperience, in experiencing ourselves as process, our essential relatedness toother processes in other times and places, are we justified in denying thisexperience to other, primary organisms? Is it not more affirmative to as-sume that, in some sense, a primary organism, being a dynamical process,is aware, or experiences itself as process and, to the extent that it does,file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (55 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmpossesses itself an internal horizon? Of course, this question can never beresolved by science, focusing as it does only on the external aspects of aprocess. It seems reasonable, however, to postulate an element of mind,that is, an internal horizon, as basically intrinsic to even the simplest pri-mary organism. This postulate allows for the reintroduction of value andteleology into nature. Clearly, nature appears to our common sense to havepurpose and value; it seems to evolve from simple to more complex, fromprimitive to more advanced, from less conscious to more conscious. In-deed, it appears to have direction, and it seems to have purpose, whichguides it in that direction. Yet, we are asked by science, in the face of all ev-idence, all reason, and all intuition, to regard nature as purposeless, mean-ingless, and valueless. If we admit mind as an aspect of even the mostprimary organism, however, this vast complexity suddenly takes on anadded meaning; a new and deeper sublimity replaces that sense of bafflingfutility and waste with which a blind universe confronts us.Chapter 4Toward a Holographic Theory of MindA philosophy of life comprises the philosophy of the organism and the philoso-phy of mind. This is itself a first proposition of the philosophy of life, in factits hypothesis, which it must make good in the course of its execution. For thestatement of scope expresses no less than the contention that the organic evenin its lowest form prefigures mind, and that mind even on its highest reachesremains part of the organic. (Jonas 1966, p. 1)The central, in some ways the final, question in any philosophy of organ-isms, which seeks to be complete, is the question of mind. Any thorough 'explication of the phenomenon of life must face squarely the problem ofthe existence of mind and must explain its qualities adequately in termsthat do not beg the question; that is, it cannot seek to understand thenature of mind in physicochemical, reductionist terms. The insufficiencyof such an approach will inevitably betray itself, for just as the operationsof organisms cannot be reduced to the physicochemical properties of thematter that composes them because they impose boundary conditions onthe incorporated matter in such a way that the operation of the materialorganic system as a whole transcends the boundaries of physics and chem-istry, so the same holds for mind on the next hierarchical level of organiza-tion. It exhibits qualities peculiar to itself, such that it is not simplyfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (56 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmreducible to events occurring in the organic matrix from which it arises, al-though it certainly includes those events in the conditions of its organiza-tion and functioning. This amounts to saying that mind is more than thesum of its parts, just as the fact of a living organism is more than the sumof its atoms and molecules and their interactions; in each case, an adequateexplanation must have recourse to a more comprehensive hierarchical levelof organization than the physicochemical level, in the case of organism,and than the organic level, in the case of mind. The existence of an organ-ism or of a mind imposes boundary conditions on the next lower level oforganization. Organisms and minds incorporate and yet transcend suchlower levels (M. Polanyi 1968).The hierarchical structuring of organisms and minds implies that mindcannot be totally explained through organic structure, having as it doesprinciples of organization that transcend the organic level; still, a problemremains to be dealt with, that of the nature of the relationship betweenmind and its physical matrix, a brain. That the organization of the minddoes partially reflect the physical organization of the brain can be seen byanyone willing to accept the evidence of experimental neurophysiology.The questions still to be answered are: What is the nature of the physicalinterface of brain and mind? Where is this interface found in the neuralstructure? and How does the organization of the brain reflect the organi-zation of the mind? In recent years, neurophysiology has come a consider-able distance toward answering these questions, particularly through itsdiscovery of the apparently holographic nature of brain-mind organiza-tion. In this chapter, we intend to examine this holographic principle ofneural organization by outlining the state of empirical discoveries to datein this area of research. Finally, we will venture some philosophical specu-lations intended to suggest that the holographic structure of mind maysimply reflect, on one hierarchical level, a principle of organization pres-ent at all levels in nature.Holography is a young science whose enormous potential is only nowbeginning to be explored, although its principles were first discovered acci-dentally, in 1947, by Dr. Dennis Gabor in trying to design improvementsfor the electron microscope. It was not until the advent of lasers, whichprovided a coherent, concentrated light source, that the technology be-came available that could implement the principles (cf. Pennington 1968,pp. 40-49). Conventional holography is a technique for making lensless,file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (57 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmthree-dimensional photographs, whose basis is fairly simple. A low-intensity laser beam is passed through a semiopaque mirror, causing partof the beam to pass through the mirror and illuminate the object to bephotographed. This light is then reflected from the object onto a photo-graphic plate in front of the object. Simultaneously, the other part of thebeam is reflected off a series of mirrors such that it falls on the photo-graphic plate at an angle to the beam reflected from the object (see fig. 1).This convergence of the two beams of coherent light creates an interfer-ence pattern that is recorded on the photographic plate. The image that isrecorded on the photographic plate, which is called the hologram (Gr.Holos, whole), bears little resemblance to the object photographed; it ismerely a record of the interference pattern of the two intersecting beams.When this hologram is reilluminated using a single, unsplit laser beam,however, a unique phenomenon occurs: Floating in empty space justbeyond the illuminated hologram is a fully three-dimensional replica ofthe object originally photographed. Such a holographic image does notmerely give the illusion of three-dimensionality; it is as three-dimensionalfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (58 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmas the original object, can be viewed from any angle, will exhibit parallaxwith other objects or holograms, and can be photographed with a conven-tional camera. It is, in fact, indistinguishable from its original model byvision alone and can only be so distinguished by passing one's hand orother material object through the image to reveal that it is composed ofwhat in physics is called a standing waveform, an apparently motionlessarrangement of photons.Holograms exhibit several other unique properties of particular rele-vance to our discussion to follow. For instance, what are called volume holograms have an as yet untapped potential for information storage. Animage can be recorded onto the hologram in the conventional manner de-file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (59 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmscribed; the plate can then be tilted slightly with respect to its recordinglaser beams and the image of a second object reexposed onto the sameplate without disrupting the previously recorded image. The hologramcan then be decoded at angle I to yield an image of the first object, or atangle 2 to yield the second object. A large number of separate objects canthus be coded into a single hologram and replayed by illuminating thehologram from the proper angles.Another peculiar quality of holograms is that because the hologramrecords a set of interference patterns, this pattern is distributed equallyand ubiquitously throughout the holographic plate, such that any part ofit embodies the whole image. In a conventional photograph, each pointfrom the scene corresponds to one point in the photograph; in a holo-gram, each point is diffused to many points in the holographic plate.Thus, one can take a hologram and tear it in half and then shine a laser onone of the halves; the resulting image will be a reconstruction of the entireobject; if one then tears it into quarters and illuminates one of the quar-ters, the result is still the same: The total image can be reconstructed fromany fragment of the hologram, right down to the very smallest chip ofthe plate. In theory, a fragment of a hologram will yield a total image of theobject without significant loss of resolution unless the fragment is so smallas to approach the size of the wavelength of the illuminating beam. Inpractice, however, the coarseness of the photographic emulsion will causea loss of detail considerably before this level is reached, so that while atotal image can be reconstructed from even a very small chip of a holo-gram, if the chip is too minute, the image will be lacking in detail. Onlythe details will be lost, however; the essence of the entire message will re-main to the last. Similarly, if the hologram is layered (two or more im-ages are recorded in the same hologram), each one of the images will bepreserved intact throughout each part of the hologram matrix.We can thus distinguish two features of holography that make it uniqueas an information storage device: The first is that any one of its parts isequal to the sum of its parts, because the message is reduplicated ubiqui-tously throughout every part of the hologram. If we had to formulate thisinto a geometrical axiom, we would say that all points are cotangent. Thesecond feature is that the hologram records the essence of an object, andthus, repeated superimposition of essences supplies the details, the particu-larities, of the object when the total hologram is illuminated.file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (60 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmTo understand the applicability of holographic principles to the organi-zation of the brain, it is necessary to talk about memory. One of the para-doxes of memory storage is that a person is born with practically all theneurons that he or she will ever possess; whereas growth of normal tissue iscaused by cell division, the nerve cells do not divide, and, moreover, willnot regenerate if damaged, although the axon of a nerve cell can regenerateprovided the cell body containing the nucleus is undamaged. The problemfacing scientists investigating memory and learning has been one of under-standing how the brain can store memories and learned information withapparently no alteration of neural organization; how can new informationbe stored in the brain in the absence of nerve-cell reproduction? The prob-lem has been a baffling one for scientists searching for engrams, or memorytraces, some evidence of a neural reorganization corresponding to a storedinput of information.This paradox was partially resolved by Karl Lashley (cf. Lashley 1950,pp. 454-482) when he demonstrated that under certain conditions of pro-longed or repeated stimulation, the nerve cell can multiply its productionof nerve fibers, thus creating new synaptic junctions without actual repro-duction of the cells. This can occur in the following manner: The nervecells ordinarily are surrounded and prevented from growing new fibers byencasing cells called glia. It has been found (Pribram 1971a, p. 471), how-ever, that electrical stimulation of a nerve synapse triggers the productionof specific molecules of RNA, which have been found to cause (or at leastto be correlated with) heightened metabolic activity of the glial cells, thusencouraging them to divide; the tip of the neuron fiber is then free to growbetween the daughter glial cells to form new contacts with the neurons be-yond it. In this way, the synaptic microstructure can be modified by expe-rience; an interrelated set of such modified neuronal synapses canconstitute the neural engram, the encoded memory trace. The result ofthis process is that the brain develops a kind of neural model of the envi-ronment, a spatiotemporal pattern of organization against which inputsare constantly matched.One aspect of the neuronal storage process had still to be understood.Granted that an input of new information elicited the production ofa new set of neural junctions, which when restimulated decoded itself as amemory or learned behavior, the question yet remained as to whetherthere was a one-for-one correspondence between each part of the memoryfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (61 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmor perception, or was the memory and/or perception distributed equallythroughout every part of the synaptic microstructure? In other words,does one nerve cell, for instance, comprise some fragment of the total ex-perience, one bit of information that will be lost to the whole if thatnerve cell is damaged? Or does each and every part of the synaptic en-gram simultaneously contain all bits of the whole experience? Experi-ments performed by Lashley, in which large areas of the cerebrum of ratswere destroyed without significantly impairing learning or recognition,indicate that the latter case is the truer one. Lashley found that, while in-tensity of recall was in proportion to the mass of the brain, nothing shortof removal of the entire cerebrum could interrupt recall altogether. Thushe was led to postulate the principles of mass action and equipotentialityin his theory of memory: Intensity of recall depends on the total mass ofthe brain, but memory is recorded ubiquitously throughout the cere-brum. Here, at last, we begin to gain a glimpse of the relevance of holog-raphy in neural organization. As in a hologram, the meaning—storedmemory or learned information—appears to be stored ubiquitouslythroughout the cerebral matrix rather than to be caused by the interrela-tionship of separate parts. This is the implication, at least, of experimentsin which the disruption of the electrical field of the brain, using alumi-num hydroxide cream, failed to impair pattern discrimination, while sur-gical removal of large sections failed to impair memory, learning, orrecognition (Pribram 1971b, p. 47f.).These experiments appear to demonstrate that memories and learnedbehavior have multiple representation in the cortex; in other words, theinformation is stored redundantly in the neural matrix so that removal ordisruption of part of the cortex will not distort the message stored in an-other part. Redundant storage, however, is still not equivalent to holo-graphic storage. The redundant system can be compared to a stack ofseveral hundred photocopies of the same message; when part of the stackis removed, the message still resides in the rest of the stack. Ablation of thecortex is analogous to removing part of the stack of pages. If, however, wetook the stack of photocopies, threw them up in the air, tore some intofragments, and glued them back together at random, the conventionalmessage, even though redundant, would be disrupted; but if we had per-formed this operation on a stack of holograms, no amount of randomshuffling, tearing, and repasting would disrupt the message, because theentire message resides in each of the parts and does not depend on the re-file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (62 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmlationship between parts. If the brain truly is capable of storing informa-tion in a holographic fashion, not only would it be unaffected by corticalablation, but it should not be disrupted by a random rearrangement of itsanatomy. Experiments involving just such an anatomical shuffle of partswere carried out by Dr. Paul Pietsch, using cortical sections from salaman-ders. The theory was that such shuffling of cortical parts would not dis-rupt normal salamander behavior if the holographic theory were true:In more than 700 operations, I rotated, reversed, added, sub-tracted, and scrambled brain parts. I shuffled. I reshuffled. I sliced,lengthened, deviated, shortened, opposed, transposed, juxtaposed,and flipped. I spliced front to back with lengths of spinal cord, ormedulla, with other pieces of brain turned inside out. But nothingshort of dispatching the brain to the slopbucket—nothingexpunged feeding! . . . The experiments had subjected the holo-graphic theory to a severe test. As the theory predicted, scramblingthe brains anatomy did not scramble its programs. Meaning wascontained within the parts, not spread out among their relation-ships. If I wanted to change behavior, I had to supply not a newanatomy, but new information. (Pietsch 1972, pp. 46, 48)The clincher to these encouraging results came when Pietsch trans-planted the brain of a tadpole to the cranium of a salamander. While thesalamander is a traditional predator on the tubifex worm, the tadpole issymbiotic to it, using its sucker mouth to remove algae from the flanks ofthe tubifex without harming it. Pietsch found that the salamander with thetransplanted tadpole brain mimicked the tadpole, and in more than eigh-teen hundred trials, the salamander did not once attack the tubifex: Thetransplanted herbivorous brain had carried its holographic set of peacefulbehavior patterns right into the salamander's cranium. Vindication of theholographic theory of information storage was complete.Two questions remain to be answered. Granting that the cerebrum canstore information in a manner analogous to holographic storage, thenwhat mechanism in the brain can function in the role of the interferencepattern set up by the two encoding laser beams in normal holography, andwhat mechanism functions in the role of the single decoding beam usedfor retrieval of the holographic image?file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (63 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmThe key to answering the first question lies in the understanding thatholography does not depend on the physical presence of light waves.Holograms have been constructed from sound waves and even infraredwaves. R. W. Rodieck (cf. Pribram 1969, p. 77) has shown that the mathe-matical equations describing the holographic process match exactly whatthe brain does with information, and computer simulations of holo-graphic storage have been carried out on the basis of the equations (con-volutional integrals and Fourier transformations) alone. It is not thepresence of physical waves, as such, that is needed for making a hologram,but rather an interference pattern, a ratio of harmonic relationships:The question remains: how can interference effects be producedin the brain? One can imagine that when nerve impulses arriveat synapses (the junction between two nerve cells), they produceelectrical events on the other side of the synapse that take theform of momentary standing wave fronts. Typically the junctionsmade by a nerve fiber number in the dozens, if not hundreds.The patterns set up by arriving nerve impulses presumably form amicrostructure of wave forms that can interact with similar micro-structures arising in overlapping junctional contacts. These othermicrostructures are derived from the spontaneous changes inelectrical potential that ceaselessly occur in nerve tissue, and fromother sources within the brain. Immediate cross-correlationsresult, and these can add in turn to produce new patterns of nerveimpulses.The hypothesis presented here is that the totality of this processhas a more or less lasting effect on protein molecules and perhapsother macromolecules at the synaptic junctions and can serve as aneural hologram from which, given the appropriate input, animage can be reconstructed. (Pribram 1969, p. 77)The long-known functional areas of the brain, such as Broca's area(speech cortex), the visual cortex at the back of the brain, or the auditorycortex at the sides, may function as the mechanism for reconstruction ofa stored neural hologram to yield a memory, perception, or thought. Theseareas are known to have a function in various modes of behavior and per-ception, and for many years it was thought that they were storage sites re-lating to specific functions such as speech, vision, hearing, and so on. Infile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (64 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmthe holographic theory, these centers would act not to store information,but rather as processing stations for the encoding and recalling of pro-grams from the holographic storage areas of the cerebral cortex. Thus,these functional centers could operate in the role of the reconstructing laser beam; whether the memory or perception was experienced visually,auditorily, tactually, or as some combination would depend on what cen-ters were activated in reconstruction, a process that would be equivalent tousing lasers of different wavelengths in reconstruction.What kind of neural mechanism plays the role of the coherentlight source to make and display holograms? Perhaps a kind ofcoherence results from the anatomical fact that the retina andvisual cortex are linked by many thousands of fibers arranged inparallel pathways. Or it could be that the nerve cells in the visualchannel achieve coherence by rhythmic firing. Still another possi-bility is that coherence results from the operation of the varietyof detectors that respond to such simple stimuli as the tilt of a lineand movement. . . (Pribram 1969, p. 77)It is not possible to outline entirely the present state of experimentaland theoretical evidence centering on holographic neural organization.Many areas of uncertainty still exist in current research that, it is to behoped, will yield to scientific understanding in the near future. One sucharea is split-brain research, focusing on investigating the brains operationwhen the corpus callosum, the intermediary pathway between the left andright cerebral hemispheres, has been severed. Certain results of this researchsuggest that each hemisphere records only specific kinds of information, afinding that would tend to contradict the holographic theory of ubiquitousstorage; other theorists suggest that this may only indicate unequal accessto information in the right hemisphere, rather than unequal storage. A de-finitive answer awaits further research. There is no doubt that other objec-tions could be leveled at the holographic theory that have not been met byus as laypersons. It seems clear, however, that the principles of neural orga-nization do bear some significant similarities to holography, although itwould of course be presumptuous to claim that holography explains all as-pects of brain organization. No such claim is made here; we seek only toprovide a basic understanding of the (probably) fundamental role playedby holographic structuring in the present picture of neural organization.The interested reader should examine Karl Pribram's Languages of the Brain(1971) for the current status of holographic theories of brain function.file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (65 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmLet us now turn to the more philosophical and speculative aspect ofthis theory of mind. Granted that holography reflects in part the structureand organization of the brain, and granted also that the brain and itsstructure will in part reflect the nature of the mind arising from it, it fol-lows therefore that the mind itself must in some sense be holographicallystructured. The questions we must ask then are: (1) In what sense is themind holographically structured, and (2) why should it be so structured?Let us illustrate the first question with a diagram representing mind-world interaction. We can represent this interaction by two overlappingcircles, or realms, which we designate as A and B (fig. 2). Circle Arepresents the physical world. Circle B represents the mind; this is theseat of thoughts, will, creativity: in short, circle B comprises the experi-encing self, which, through the brain-body liaison, makes its causal pres-ence felt in the external world. We can think of circle B as existing in thetemporal dimension; it is a process developing through time, much in theway that a piece of music develops through the temporal process of beingplayed. The realm where the two circles overlap, which we call C, formsthe region of interface between the physical world and the mind. RealmC corresponds to the brain-body system; it forms the pathway by whichthe mind receives information (perception), and also the mechanism bywhich it responds to its perceptions. The comparison to holography thatthis suggests can be made through analogy; the brain-body system repre-sented by realm C is comparable to the physical apparatus necessary forgenerating a hologram; the brain in this analogy is equivalent to the ex-posed holographic plate; the body, with its afferent and efferent path-ways, acts as the laser system, both receiving (perceiving) information andencoding this information into the neural holographic plate. Realm B, inthis analogy, the realm of states of consciousness, is then comparable tofile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (66 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmthe actual holographic image, the standing wave form of ongoing aware-ness. Circle A, which includes external reality and the subjectively experi-enced state of the body, forms the subject, which becomes encodedthrough receptors and afferent pathways into the neural holographicplate, where it is then reconstructed as part of realm B, that part ofrealm B representing its model of the external world. So far, this anal-ogy lacks the notion of temporal flux. The interactions between the mindand the body, and through the body with the external world, consist ofdynamic processes. The analogy with holography is more accurate if wethink of the process as a holographic movie rather than as a static, frozenimage. In this dynamic version, the neural hologram (the brain) is con-tinually exposed and reexposed to the changing environment, thus en-coding a constantly shifting set of interference patterns that are read out as a temporally unfolding hologram, that is, the mind, with its constantlyshifting model of reality and associated thoughts, memories, images,and reflections.The holographic capacity of the mind for ubiquitous storage of infor-mation can be seen most readily in the phenomenon of imagination. Wecan imagine all of the universe or any part of it and thus can say that themind contains all of the physical world, that is, that the mind is a holo-gram of external reality. This concept has been anticipated by the al-chemists in their notion of man as microcosm, and also in the symbol ofthe alchemical monad (cf. Jung 1952, pp. 103-104, 370), a synonym for theLapis Philosophorum, that part in which the whole may be found. Refer-ence might also be made to the central axiom of Hermeticism, the Hel-lenistic philosophical system that is the forerunner of alchemy: What ishere is everywhere; what is not here is nowhere (cf. Jung 1952). This is aformula for a holographic matrix.The complex symbol systems of alchemy are but one example of aproperty that seems to characterize mind in general; that is, its tendency toconstruct symbolic totality metaphors. The constructs of the mind are, byand large, couched in symbols; even raw sensory data is seldom experi-enced without symbolic interpretations, associations, and judgments. Thistendency of the mind to symbolize, to organize experience into meaning-ful, coherent pattern is indicative of its ceaseless effort to somehow en-compass reality, to construct a suitable model of self and world. Thisquality of mind is seen best of all, however, in the dynamics of uncon-file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (67 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmscious processes, in dreams, vision, and trance; indeed, the individuationprocess in Jungian psychology represents an attempt by the unconscious toconstruct a totality symbol that both encompasses and defines the self andthe world in relation to the self. Jung has shown in numerous works (cf.1952, 1959) the important role played by mandala symbolism as a meansfor expressing the underlying order of psychic unity and totality. Thisproperty of symmetrical, mandalic organization is found universally in allartifacts of human thought, from the most abstract metaphysical systemsto the commonest objects of everyday use, and it, indeed, appears to be in-trinsic to the organization of the psyche. May not this proclivity of themind to elaborate symbolic totality metaphors be reflective of the holo-graphic structure of the psyche?The unformed archetypes of the collective unconscious may be theholographic substrate of the species' mind. Each individual mind-brainis then like a fragment of the total hologram; but, in accordance withholographic principles, each fragment contains the whole. It will be re-membered that each part of a hologram can reconstruct an entire image,but that the details of the image will deteriorate in proportion to its frag-mentation, while the overstructure will remain. Out of this feature ofholography arises the quality of individual point of view and, in fact, in-dividuality itself. If each mind is a holographic medium, then each iscontiguous with every other, because of the ubiquitous distribution of in-formation in a hologram. Each individual mind would thus be a repre-sentation of the essence of reality, but the details could not be resolveduntil the fragments of the collective hologram were joined.We have seen that the construction of an immaterial corpuscular stand-ing waveform image from the physical substrate of the holographic plateis closely analogous to the generation of the mind from the holographiccerebral substrate. We will mention some other qualities of a hologramthat indicate its suitability as a model of mind. One example is the recon-struction of a hologram using nonvisible light; this is perfectly possibleand in the mind would constitute an unconscious content. Another inter-esting quality of holograms is that they can be constructed using laserbeams reflected from two objects, which then interfere on the holographicplate; when the hologram is then reilluminated using one beam, both ob-jects appear. Thus we can say that holographic matrices have the propertyof associative recall.file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (68 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmThe list of examples could be extended; however, these should illustrateour point—that the mind itself, as well as the brain from which it arises,does, to some extent, exhibit holographic qualities. Let us now venture tospeculate how and why this might be so.Confronted with certain holographic qualities as a feature of bothmind and brain, it seems reasonable to ask whether holographic principlesare found on other levels of organization. We can find this most appar-ently in the organismic realm, in the fact of the ubiquity and redundancyof DNA. We refer to the fact that DNA seems to store information holo-graphically, in that the nucleotide sequence of the molecule is identical inevery cell of a given organism. The DNA from one cell theoretically con-tains all the information necessary to regenerate the entire organism. It isdue to the presence of certain inductors (notably RNA) that DNAmakes some cells into skin, others into nerves, and still others into mus-cles, and so on. Thus, on the organismic level, also, we note the ubiquityof genetic information, but also that each cell reads only some part ofthe DNA-hologram, though the entire message is there.When we descend to an even more basic level of organization, theatomic level, the holographic metaphor is not so readily apparent. We areessentially asking whether a holographic structure underlies the nature ofexternal reality itself. If this could be shown, it would explain why holo-graphic structure is reflected in the organization of DNA, the brain, andmind. We find that we have been preceded in our speculations by Leib-niz, in his concept of the cosmic Monad (cf. Leibniz 1890, pp. 218ff).Leibniz argues that the universe is a plenum, and that it is composed of asimple substance that is everywhere and alike in all its parts, and that itis by virtue of the affectations and interactions between these parts, ormonads, that distinctness and particularity arise:. . . Each monad, its nature being representative, nothing can limitit to representing only a part of things; although it may be truethat this representation is but confused as regards the detail of thewhole universe, and can be distinct only in the case of a small partof things, that is to say, in the case of those which are nearest orlargest in relation to each of the monads—otherwise each monadwould be a divinity. It is not in the object, but only in the modifi-cation of the knowledge of the object that monads are limited.They all tend confusedly toward the infinite, toward the whole,file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (69 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmbut they are limited, and distinguished by their degrees of distinctperceptions . . . (Leibniz 1890, pp. 223, 226-228)Leibniz is saying that each monad is identical to every other monad,differing only by its perspective, its relation to the whole, that is, toother monads, each of which mirrors every other. A similar idea is en-countered in Whitehead's concept of the extensive continuum, whichhe characterizes as a relational complex in which all potential objectifica-tions find their niche. This extensive continuum can be conceived as theset of all possible relationships, both actual and potential, both of all ac-tual and of all potential entities. The extensive continuum therefore... expresses the solidarity of all possible standpoints throughout thewhole process of the world. It is not a fact prior to the world; it is the firstdetermination of order—that is, of real potentiality—arising out of thegeneral character of the world (Whitehead 1967, p. 82). The extensivecontinuum can thus be viewed as a holographic matrix of all potentiality.Only a finite number of potentialities ever become realized as actual enti-ties, in the same way that a holographic plate in which multiple imageshave been stored at different orientations can be decoded at some an-gles, but not at others:In the mere continuum there are contrary potentialities; in theactual world there are definite atomic actualities determining onecoherent system of real divisions throughout the region of actual-ity. Each actual entity in its relationship to other actual entities isin this sense somewhere in the continuum, and arises out of thedata provided by this standpoint. But in another sense it is every-where throughout the continuum; for its constitution includes theobj ectifications of the actual world and thereby includes the con-tinuum; also the potential objectifications of itself contribute tothe real potentialities whose solidarity the continuum expresses.Thus the continuum is present in each actual entity, and eachactual entity pervades the continuum. (Whitehead 1967, p. 83)Quantum theory gives a view of the underlying substructure of realitythat is quite consistent with the holographically structured metaphysicalmodels of Leibniz and Whitehead. The particulate concept of matter hasbeen superseded by the idea that the atom is both wave and particle, bothcontinuum and actual entity. Bohr was the first to show that the electron,file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (70 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmthe basic subunit of matter, could not be considered to have a spatiotem-poral location (around the nucleus of an atom, for example), but insteadhad to be mathematically approached as a cloud of probability: The freeelectron possesses a mass coincident with the entire universe, and its oc-currence at a given space-time locus is a function of extreme possibility,not of definable position. This quantum concept of the electron is strik-ingly reminiscent of the Leibnizian monad, that is both here and every-where at once. Under the quantum theory, each quantum of matter isboth wave and particle and pervades the universe; there is no solid matteras such, but only probability densities in the continuum, interference pat-terns created by the interaction of quanta that, to the synthesizing percep-tual mechanism in the brain-mind, appear as objects— actual entities —rocks, tables, people, stars, and so on. Thus, a holographic image of re-ality is reconstructed by the brain-mind from the underlying substrate ofconcrescences of probability. Note the similarity here to the potentiality ofWhitehead's extensive continuum.Would such a model of a holographic extensive continuum be inconsis-tent with the theory of relativity? If all points reflect every other point, and if all points are cotangent, as implied by a holographic theory of aquantum-monad, then how can the relativity of space-time be preserved?The objection is overcome if we postulate that space-time exists within eachmonad (quantum); thus, each wave-particle would have relativistic effectsoperating within it. A collection of such quanta (a galaxy, for instance)would also have relativistic effects, resulting from the superimposition ofthe space-time events occurring in each of its monadic parts. Rememberthat in a holographic monadology not only does each part mirror the wholebut the whole (or any fragment thereof) mirrors each part; thus, we wouldexpect relativistic effects on all levels, from the quantum to the cosmic.The example of hierarchical cosmic sub-structures (Wilson 1969)shows that levels may be distinguished by a characteristic time orfrequency, which is to say that each level is temporally closed. Thissuggests that the propetties of space and time are closure proper-ties of structures, bringing to mind the basic idea of Leibniz thatspace and time have no independent existence, but derive fromthe nature of structures. Einstein's equivalence of dynamics andgeometry contained in his field equations (e.g., matter and densitydetermines spatial curvature) is also consistent with Leibniz's viewfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (71 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmand a departure from the Newtonian idea that all structure existswithin an independent framework of space and time. It may thenbe that from the various closures and partial closures of structuresand systems, we infer the descriptions we call space and time . . .(Whyte et al. 1969, p. 55)We can see that while relativity would operate in each monad, and inthe universe as monad, the extensive continuum of potentiality wouldexist outside of space-time in a fifth Einsteinian dimension. Space-time,and the relativistic effects arising therefrom, would exist as properties ofactual entities existing in the extensive continuum, but the continuum it-self, underlying the configurations of three dimensions, would exhibit thequality of simultaneity, as, in some sense, the holographic matrix of po-tentiality would make all times simultaneous. Let us now summarize the factual and speculative ground we have coveredin our holographic theory of mind. We began by noting the special quali-ties of holography and went on to illustrate that the organization of thebrain seems to be in part holographic. We have introduced evidence whichsuggests that the mind itself is holographic in quality and to that extent re-flects its neural substrate. We have speculated that this holographic struc-ture of the mind may proceed from the fact that holographic principlesoperate on many structural levels; the ubiquity and redundancy of DNAin organisms was mentioned as an illustration of this. We found that holo-graphic principles might also be applied to the structure of reality itself byvirtue of the quantum nature of matter, whose wave-particle qualities sug-gest a holographic monad. Finally, we saw that such a holographic modelof reality did not violate the laws of relativity if it were postulated that themonadic substrate existed in a fifth Einsteinian dimension, that is, a fourthspatial dimension. We are not prepared to assert the truth of our specula-tions over other models of reality, recognizing that all such models are ulti-mately constructs of the human mind, each no truer than any other.Nevertheless, a holographic picture of mind and of external reality has en-hanced our understanding of both.Chapter 5Models of Drug ActivityIn recent years great strides have been made toward the elucidation of thefile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (72 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmneurophysiological and neurochemical processes underlying the phenom-enon of consciousness. The Cartesian dualism of strict separation of mindand body has come to be recognized for what it is, at worst a dogmatic pre-sumption without any empirical basis, at best a methodological expedient(cf. chapter 3). Most physiologists have graduated to a view of the organ-ism as a complex, integrated system, not reducible to merely the sum ofthe physicochemical processes taking place within it. The primary featureof organisms is, after all, organization—the complex spatiotemporal order-ing of processes on the molecular and physiological level that makes theorganism an integrated whole rather than a disorganized mush of pro-teins (cf. Sinnot 1950, p. 21). The next logical step in the recognitionof the principle of organization as a fundamental constituent of livingthings is its extension to the problem of consciousness in higher organisms:Interpreted in terms of the present hypothesis, therefore, thewhole conscious life of human beings, rich in ideas, in inspiration,in intellectual subtleties, in imagination and emotion, is simplythe manifestation of an organized biological system raised to itsloftiest levels. Upon this the outer world impinges as a series ofsensations, real or imagined, and out of it come actions, eitheractual physical responses or the more subtle ones of the mind.What takes place between these events is, at bottom, the regula-tory activity of the protoplasmic system. In its lowliest expressionthis appears as regulatory control of growth and function. Thismerges imperceptibly into instinct, and from these simplest ofpsychic phenomena gradually emerge the complex mental activi-ties of the higher animals and finally the enormously rich andvaried life of the mind and spirit of human beings. At no pointis there a sudden break, a radical innovation. The complex hascome from the simple by a gradual process of evolutionary pro-gression. The basic phenomenon from which all this ultimatelyarises, the fact that living things are organized systems, is thefundamental problem still unanswered. Upon its solution willdepend our understanding not only of biology and psychologybut of the whole of man. (Sinnot 1950, p. 721)In some branches of biology, notably the neurosciences, this funda-mental interdependence of mental phenomena and physiochemical pro-cesses has already achieved the status of a truism.file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (73 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmThe relationship between electrochemical events occurring in the brainand consciousness is made nowhere more clear than in the study of the in-fluence of psychotropic drugs, and in particular the hallucinogens, on thephenomenology of consciousness. The alteration of mental function thathallucinogens can elicit illustrates that our apprehension of reality islargely determined by chemical and physiological parameters. It is onlythrough an accident of evolution that our nervous systems—and theversion of reality that they provide us—have come to be structured as theyare. This profound interdependence of mind and the molecular configu-ration of its neural substrate appear to be a direct repudiation of the exis-tential proposition that nature is mute. In recent years great progress has been made in the elucidation of themolecular and biochemical mechanisms of nervous functioning, and theinteraction of these mechanisms with hallucinogenic and other psycho-tropic drugs. Yet, for all the progress, the central question remains unan-swered. This question, framed in its simplest terms, might be phrasedthus: What qualities characterize the physical interface between moleculesand mind?To date, only tentative theoretical and speculative steps have beentaken toward answering this question. In this chapter we intend to presentour own hypothetical model for drug and neurotransmitter activity; it isfirst necessary, however, to acquaint the reader with some fraction of thehypotheses and experimental findings currently extant. We will first dis-cuss the problems of drug action from the biochemical standpoint; herewe will focus on the questions of structural relationships between hallu-cinogens and neurotransmitters, their metabolic uptake by the nervoussystem, their enzymatic fates and possible endogenous origins in certainkinds of enzymatic dysfunctions, and related considerations. Second, wewill consider the problem of drug action at the receptor site and will dis-cuss problems involved with this study and current theoretical models.Last, we will present our own theoretical model, using the preceding in-formation as a basis for hypothesis.Neurotransmitters are chemicals that mediate the propagation of nervesignals across the synapse. They are released at the presynaptic nerve ter-minal and cross the synaptic gap to react with a receptor on the surfaceof a postsynaptic nerve (or other excitable postjunctional cell), and theyfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (74 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmmay either stimulate or inhibit the firing of the postjunctional cell. Onlytwo substances, acetylcholine and norepinephrine, have been definitivelyshown to function as neurotransmitters, but other likely candidates in-clude serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5HT), dopamine, epinephrine,and histamine, among others. A neurotransmitter substance should con-form to three major criteria: Nerves should be able to produce the chem-ical, the chemical should be released when nerves are stimulated and reactwith a postjunctional receptor to produce a specific biological response,and some enzymatic or other mechanism should be available to rapidlyterminate the action of the transmitter (Axelrod 1974).The structural configurations of a large number of hallucinogens havebeen elucidated, and the similarity of these to certain neurohumoral fac-tors has been noted:When the structural types in figure 3 are compared, it is strikingto see how often indole structures appear, and always in the formof tryptamine derivatives. These may be tryptamines without anysubstitution in the indole nucleus or with hydroxy- methoxy- orphosphoryloxy-groups in the phenol ring of the indole; or else thetryptamine residue forms part of a polycyclic ring system, as in thecase of the beta-carboline and lysergic acid derivatives and of ibo-gaine. The most specific and most potent hallucinogens, such asLSD (d-lysergic acid diethylamide) and psilocybin, belong to thetryptamine type.Since they are tryptamine derivatives, the indolic hallucinogensare structurally related to the neurohumoral factor serotonin(5-hydroxytryptamine). Serotonin is widely distributed in warm-blooded animals. It accumulates in the brain, where it plays arole in the biochemistry of nervous regulations. Consequently,it seems that certain tryptamine structures which occur so fre-quently in hallucinogens, as well as in the neurohormone sero-tonin, may be biochemically important in the metabolism ofpsychic functions . . .A chemical relationship similar to that between the trypta-minelike hallucinogens and serotonin exists between the phenyl-ethylamine derivative mescaline and the neurohormonenorepinephrine. (Schultes and Hofmann 1973, pp. 17-20)file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (75 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (76 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htm In view of the structural analogies between neurohormones and thefile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (77 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmhallucinogens, it is not surprising that many studies have shown an inter-action between drugs and neurotransmitters. There are still problems infinally delineating these interactions, since a drug will often exhibit avariety of interactions; thus, while the following passage illustrates thatthere is an interaction with serotonin and NE mechanisms, these are byno means the sole types of action that can occur:To the already formidable list of complications in the interpreta-tion of the effects of these compounds, Kopin now proceededto add some others. If there are no transmitters on which thesedrugs can act, and as there are three possible modes of interaction(potentiation, inhibition, or both, with no net effect) there maybe as many as 3n possible modes of interaction produced by thedrug. To this one must add the quantitative consideration thatdrugs often have one effect at one dose level, and the opposite atanother; action on different brain areas must be considered; thefact that there may be more than one type of receptor of a mole-cule will also be a determinant.The effect of a drug may depend on its action at multiple sites.For example, for effect X to materialize, the drug must inhibit5HT synapses, potentiate NE synapses, and have no effect onhistamine synapses. For effect Y, it may be necessary to inhibit his-tamine and NE synapses and have no effect on 5HT synapses, etc.(Smythies, in Schmitt et al. 1971, p. 32)The technical problems inherent in the study of chemical transmissionat the synapse have proved virtually insurmountable in the case of thecentral nervous system. The result has been that experimental investiga-tions have concentrated on the role of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine(Mandell and Spooner 1968) in the peripheral nervous system. Hence,many of the theoretical models for neurotransmitter function in the cen-tral nervous system have been drawn from studies conducted on acetyl-choline in the peripheral nervous system.Any similar investigations of the synaptic events in the central nervoussystem are complicated by several factors:The technical problems involved with any attempt to use analo-gously systematic research approaches to a potential transmitterfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (78 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmin the central nervous system are great. Peripheral synapses canbe isolated by microdissection, they can remain functional inan isolated profusion experimental situation for hours, and theiractivation can be manifested by clearly defined and measurablephenomena (such as the miniature end-plate potential or thecontraction of smooth muscle). The central nervous system haslittle in the way of focal synaptic regions. The dendrites and thecell bodies of central neurons are densely covered with synapses,many of which may be of a chemically heterogenous nature. Inaddition, the extra-neuronal space is packed with a tangle of glia,closely approximating the membranous surfaces of nerve cellsand possibly intrinsically important to their function. This makesthe isolated, chemical manipulation of central synapses extremelydifficult. (Mandell and Spooner 1968, p. 1443)Because of these complications, most of our evidence for norepineph-rine and serotonin as the primary central synaptic transmitters is at bestof an indirect nature. Data that seem to indicate that these compoundsact as neurotransmitters in the central nervous system include observa-tions of regional differences in the distribution of these compounds in thebrain, a distribution of synthesizing and degradative enzymes that closelyparallels the distribution of the amine, high levels of these amines and ofenzymes related to their synthesis in the subcellular fractions associatedwith synaptic vesicles, and high levels of degradative enzymes in the sub-cellular fractions associated with synaptic structures (cf. Mandell andSpooner 1968).A diagrammatic model of the probable actions of a neurotransmitter atthe synapse is shown in figure 4. Drugs could alter neurotransmitter func-tion by influencing one or more of these steps. Current theories as to thepossible nature of the interaction of hallucinogenic drugs with serotoninand NE functions have tended to favor the concept that they function asfalse transmitters and can be bound into the receptor site in place of theendogenous neurotransmitters:file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (79 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htm The false transmitter replaces the NE in the storage granules sothat less NE is released, because a constant number of moleculesare released by nerve impulse. False transmitters can compete forneuronal uptake of NE. Thus the NE that is released will bepotentiated; blockage of uptake potentiates the action of thecatecholamine. On the other hand, the false transmitter mightinteract with the receptor, preventing the NE from activatingit and thereby depressing the effect of the released physiologicfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (80 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmtransmitter. Finally, the false transmitter itself may activate thereceptor, but usually not as efficiently as NE. In other words, asingle substance can, through at least six different mechanisms,alter the effectiveness of the nerve impulse.The reaction of these compounds may be understood if lookedat from the standpoint of the amine group. The amine group hasa potential for interacting with a wide variety of receptor sites. Asgroups are added to the molecule, it becomes more difficult forthe molecule to interact with these various receptor sites. If onehas the phenylethylamine structure only, it will fit, perhaps, onlyNE and 5HT; it will not fit the histamine site. If a methoxy groupis added, this may make it more difficult for it to fit the adrenergicreceptor, and it now reacts almost purely with the serotonergicreceptor. The chemical manipulation therefore changes the bal-ance of the interaction of the compound with various receptorsites. (Symthies, in Schmitt et al. 1971, pp. 29, 67)A good deal can be learned about the actions of both neurotransmittersand hallucinogenic drugs by studying the enzymatic mechanisms func-tioning in their metabolism. Studies of this nature have shown clearly thatenzymes are present in the brain that are capable of synthesizing endog-enous hallucinogenic compounds. Among the most important of these arephenol-O-methyl transferase, which can O-methylate tyramine to formthe potentially psychotomimetic substance paramethoxyphenylethyla-mine; N-methyl transferase, first isolated from rabbit lung, can synthesizedimethyltryptamine and bufotenin from tryptamine and serotonin, andhydroxy-indole O-methyl transferase, an enzyme of the pineal gland,which can O-methylate N-acetylserotonin to form melatonia, and bufo-tenin to form 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltrypamine. In addition, the hallu-cinogenic substance 6-methoxyletrahydroharman_ has been found to beidentical with the pineal hormone adrenoglomerulotropine. A potentialprecursor for this, 6-methoxyharmalan, has been found to derive frommetatonin:Of much interest is the recent discovery of substances closelyrelated to the harmala alkaloids in animals. One of these isadrenoglomerulotropine, a hormone of the pineal body, the chem-ical identity of which has been indicated as 2,3,4,9-tetrahydro-file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (81 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htm6-methoxy-i-methyl-iH-pyrido (3,4,6) indole. This substance isidentical to 6-methoxyletrahydroharman which has been shownto be formed in vivo from 5-methoxy tryptamine and acetalde-hyde. 6-methoxytetrahydroharman is an isomer of tetrahydro-harmine, one of the alkaloids in Banisteriopsis, and in the AfricanLeptactinia densiflora. One more substance, 6-methoxyharmalan,has been shown to derive, at least in vitro, from melatonin, whichresults from the methylation of acetylserotonin. The enzymewhich makes this possible, hydroxyindole O-methyl transferase,has only been found in the pineal body. (Naranjo, in Efron et al.1967, p. 385)In view of the natural occurrence in the brain of hallucinogenic com-pounds, such as 6-methoxyharmalan, and of enzymes capable of originat-ing similar compounds, it is not surprising that many researchers havelooked for enzymatic dysfunctions underlying certain types of mental dis-ease, such as schizophrenia (cf. Snyder et al. 1974).It seems unlikely that the biochemical causes of abnormal behavior canbe elucidated in the absence of any definitive understanding of the roleplayed by neurotransmitters (and possibly endogenous psychotomimetics)and their related enzyme systems in the regulation of normal behavior.Snyder (1974) makes the interesting speculation that methylated trypta-mines, enzymatically derived from serotonin substrates, may function inmonitoring people's levels of internal and external perception. Little isknown about the function of serotonin itself in the modulation of per-ceptions or mentation, but the following passage suggests that it mightfunction in a variety of ways:Elkes also suggested that the 5HT system in the brain mightrepresent an ancient evolutionary system. Serotonin was widelydistributed through animal and even plant life (i.e., vertebrates,molluscs, the sea anemone, and hairs of the white nettle). Canit be that in some way the older biological function of 5HT couldbe related to light and that a piece of (originally) light-sensitiveenzymatic machinery was in some way internalized and built intosome primitive nervous nets (the myenteric plexus, the pineal,the raphe nuclei)? It is also well to remember that some powerfulplant growth hormones, the auxins, were indoles. Could thefile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (82 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmindoles be growth regulators in the CNS? (Smythies, in Schmitt etal. 1971, p. 26)The speculation that 5HT function may be related to a light-sensitivemechanism takes on added significance if considered together with currentdata on the function of the pineal gland. The human pineal contains moreserotonin by weight than any neural structure of any mammalian species.It contains the highest levels of the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase, whichis essential in the synthesis of serotonin from tryptophan. The pineal also isthe only organ containing the enzyme HIOMT, which converts serotoninto melatonin. We have already noted that the pineal contains the hallu-cinogenic compound 6-methoxyharmalan.The pineal is one of the least understood of the brain organs; until re-cently, it was thought to be a phylogenetic relic left over from some reptil-ian ancestor as a nonfunctional third eye. It is now generally recognizedas a functional endocrine gland. The pineal's probable evolutionary deri-vation from a primitive third eye is supported by the fact that it isknown to receive a variety of environmental inputs and to respond to thisinput by circadian fluctuations in its enzyme activity, including the activ-ity of HIOMT and hence the production of melatonin:The pineal gland is now known to receive two main types of input,photic and olfactory, and to emit two main types of output, anti-gonadal and melatonin.First and most important, the pineal gland receives sense fromthe retina. This is not the sense of sight as we know it. It is adescription of intensity, type, and timing of light, and perhapsof other characteristics of light of which we are consciouslyunaware. . .Next, there is input from that area which once was known asthe rhinencephalon, the smell brain, and which now in the UnitedStates goes by the name of the limbic system or visceral brain . . .(Wiener 1968, p. 915)Evidence also exists that indicates that the pineal is sensitive to otherkinds of input in addition to photic and olfactory, including temperature,sound, long wavelength light, and X rays (Wiener 1968, pp. 923, 931).file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (83 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmPineal output appears to be regulated by an antagonistic relationshipbetween the pineal and the pituitary. They affect many of the same targetorgans, including melanocytes, gonads, brain, thyroid, thymus, andadrenal cortex, and both glands influence growth of body and of tumors,carbohydrate and fat metabolism, diuresis, and blood pressure (Wiener1968). In general, the pineal tends to have an inhibitory effect on pitu-itary hormones. This pineal-pituitary antagonism extends particularly toan interaction between pineal melatonin and pituitary MSH (melanocytestimulating hormone). The only known functions of these hormones areon pigment cells (melanocytes); melatonin lightens skin pigment cells byconcentrating pigment granules, while MSH darkens pigment cells bydispersing the granules through the cytoplasm of the cell. Although mela-tonin is the most powerful skin-lightening substance known, its precur-sor, serotonin, does not have any skin-lightening effect in doses up to4,000 micrograms (Wiener 1968). These two pigment-affecting hormoneshave been regarded by some as a phytogenetic fossil without any partic-ular function in humans. Wiener (1968), however, has proposed the boldhypothesis that the melanocytes may function as a source of pheromones,that is, exohormones or external chemical messengers (ECM), substancesreleased by an organism into the environment to affect the behavior ofother organisms:All pituitary and pineal hormones that we know, except for MSHand melatonin, exert some trophic or antitrophic effect on othersecretory cells. The MSH-melatonin pair, on the other hand, seemto act largely on pigmented cells of the skin periphery, not to reg-ulate production of any known chemical messengers, but to pushand pull pigment granules around the cell, and that in frogs ratherthan in man . . .The pigment cell makes no important hormone that acts on itsowner's body. But it is located at the surface of the skin. Couldit be making a hormone that acts on someone else's body, an exo-hormone rather than an endohormone? (Wiener 1968, p. 932)His hypothesis is interesting and suggests the related speculation thatthe neurotransmitterlike hallucinogens found in the plant kingdom maysimilarly act as pheromones (or, more accurately, allomones) when theyfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (84 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htminteract with a mammalian nervous system. Indeed, it seems reasonableto speculate that neurotransmitter-type molecules may not only functionin nervous systems but also as carriers of certain kinds of informationfrom the environment to the organism, and from the organism to otherorganisms. We will return to this speculation, and to the question ofpineal function, after we have presented our own theoretical model fordrug action at the receptor sites.Up to this point, we have been discussing, in broad terms, some of the cur-rent thinking regarding possible modes of action for hallucinogenic drugs.The probable function of neurotransmitters was outlined. The structuralanalogies between many of the hallucinogens and CNS transmitters werenoted; the parallels between the localization of neurotransmitters and theregional uptake of hallucinogens, and their possible function as false trans-mitters, was also mentioned. Next, we reviewed the evidence that enzy-matic pathways exist in the brain that could be capable of producingendogenous psychotomimetic substances from neurotransmitter substrates.Finally, we pointed out that there is likely an important, if little under-stood, relationship between the pineal and pituitary glands in the regula-tion of many of these precursor substances, that the pineal gland has beenshown to respond to a variety of external stimuli, and that it may play arole in the production of exohormones or ECM. The bulk of the pointswe have reviewed up to now represents little that is unorthodox in the cur-rent state of neurophysiological theory, and our primary purpose has beento provide an informational background for what follows. We must nowfocus our attention on the more specific question of the sequence of mo-lecular events at the synapse, and the possible influence on these events ofhallucinogenic compounds.In the first section of this chapter, we reviewed some of the data relat-ing to the probable functions of neurotransmitters in the central nervoussystem and some of the ways in which these functions might be altered byhallucinogenic drugs. In the course of our discussion, we noted that de-tailed experimental investigations of these problems are hampered by ahost of formidable technical problems. The problems associated with thestudy of the neurotransmitters, however, appear minimal when comparedwith those encountered in any attempt to characterize the molecular na-ture of the receptor site. While a good deal is known about the molecularconfiguration of the neurotransmitters, and that of drugs that interactwith them, this has provided little in the way of clues as to the molecularfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (85 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmspecifications of the receptor site. Structure-activity studies can lead totentative deductions at best, since a drug's action may be influenced byfactors other than its interaction with a receptor site. The receptor site isgenerally assumed to be located in protein, lipoprotein, or glycoproteinpresent in the membrane, and the neurotransmitter binding into the re-ceptor site is thought to induce some conformational change in themacromolecule that opens the ionic channel. Unfortunately, this cannotreveal much about the specific chemical nature of the receptor because ofthe wide variety of groups present in proteins, lipids, or carbohydrateswith which amines can interact. The problem would be lessened if some-thing were known on independent grounds about the chemical nature ofthe receptor site (Smythies 1970).Recent evidence indicating the presence of RNA in synaptosonalmembrane (Morgan and Austin 1968) has cast doubt on the assumptionthat the receptor site must be located in protein, lipid, or polysaccharide,and Smythies has proposed the hypothesis that RNA or ribonucleopro-tein present in the membrane may function as a primary receptor site.According to the model elaborated by Smythies, the possible functionalsignificance of serotonin, or one of its structurally analogous derivatives,binding to a nucleic acid site in the membrane is that RNA may act as achannel for the passage of charged ions (and, perhaps, amines themselves)through the membrane. The intercalated compounds would affect thetorsion of the RNA helix, causing it to act as a regulatory shutter mech-anism, perhaps involving charge-transfer complexes:Segments of helical RNA may be arranged perpendicular to thesurface and running through it from side to side: Each segmentwill provide two helically wound half tubes connecting the inte-rior of the cell with the exterior. The long RNA molecule wouldthus run a convoluted course through the membrane. The halftubes could be converted into full tubes or channels by runningflexible molecules with right basic bonding groups (such as poly-amines like spermine) between the phosphate groups on adjacentturns of the helix. Thus the RNA molecule will compose onepotential large tube subdivided into two smaller tubes separatedby a shutter —that is, the hydrogen bonded base pairs. If thebase pairs were disrupted, the base pairs could fly apart and openup the full lumen of the tube. The maximum length of RNArequired to cross an average membrane would be about two coils.The channel could also consist of an RNA shutter of shorterfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (86 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmlength leading to a protein channel. Now, as Hofmann and Ladik(19 61) have shown, nucleic acids have certain very interestingproperties in an electrical field. Normally they are insulators, butif they are located in an electrical field parallel to their own lengthand a powerful electron donor or acceptor intercalates at one end,the entire molecule can become a conductor by means of a migra-tion of pi electrons in the electrical field. The resulting charge-transfer can polarize the base pairs and disrupt the hydrogenbonds joining them so that they come apart and the double helixunwinds. In our model the electrical field is provided by the rest-ing potential of the neuronal membrane and the electron donoris 5HT. If this intercalates between the first base pairs on the outerend of the helical RNA, the helix could open up thus openingthe internal shutter in the channel making it large enough totransmit hydrated Na+ or K+ ions depending on the length ofthe holding polyamine stays. The flow of ions will depolarize themembrane, the RNA again becomes an insulator and the base pairhydrogen bonds reform thus closing the channel. In the meantimethe 5HT molecule will have been dislodged by the opening of thehelix and will be taken up back into the axon terminal. The exactlocation of the serotonin pi cloud with respect to the pi cloud ofthe base pairs may be a crucial factor in this mechanism. However,a mechanism for closing the K+ pore is harder to visualize for herethe membrane becomes hyperpolarized.This basic mechanism could be used for the transport of othermolecules across membranes, such as the biogenic amines them-selves. (Smythies 1969, pp. 267-269)Smythies's model is supported by evidence that 5HT and many of itsanalogs, including LSD-25, N,N-DMT, and harmine can bond to DNA,RNA, or both. The evidence for the binding of tryptamine and its analogsto nucleic acids is central both to an understanding of Smythies's modeland also to our own hypothesis of drug action. It is quoted at lengthbelow:Siegal and Salinas state that fluorescence studies reveal stronginteraction between serotonin and nucleic acids.

Of the latter compounds the diisopropyl and dibutylderivatives appear to react more vigorously with RNA than withDNA. One possible explanation for these differences may derivefrom the fact that 5HT in solution may form a complex with itself(dimer) (by pi-cloud stocking and ion-dipole bond between theN of one molecule and the O-delta of its companion). This com-plex might not itself be able to bond to nucleic acid. 5HT,bufotenin, and 5-O methyl-bufotenin could form such complexesand thus less would be available to bond to nucleic acid. Trypta-mine would form such a complex to a lesser extent (its N couldbond directly to the pi-cloud). In the case of the higher dialky-lated products the ion-dipole bond would be lessened by sterichindrance and thus more of the compound would be available tobond to nucleic acid . . .Other substitutions on the ring induce a different reaction. Fig-ures 5 and 6 show the results for additional compounds. Thisindicates that compounds with bulky ring substituents in the 5or 6 positions (particularly, 6-chlorotryptamine) have higherfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (88 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmreduction in fluorescence values with DNA than RNA. Thuscompounds with bulky N substituents appear to bind better toRNA and some with bulky ring substituents to DNA.

In the case of RNA thiswill be obtained if the tryptamine binds between two orderedpurine bases with its side-chain out so that maximum pi-cloudoverlap is hindered. But a large group on the side chain will notfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (91 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmaffect binding as this will be free. In the case of helical nucleicacid, the pi cloud is shared across the hydrogen bonds linkingthe two bases. Thus the relatively small tryptamine molecule(as compared with a typical DNA intercalator such as proflavin)could tolerate a ring substitute such as Cl increasing its lengthbetter than it would a bulky group on the N that also increases itsthickness. Likewise the bulky three and four ring molecules suchas harmine and LSD would have much more pi-cloud overlapcapacity in DNA than in single-strand RNA. Thus this evidencewould appear to support the hypothesis that tryptamine and itsderivatives bind to nucleic acids mainly by intercalation.(Smythies and Antun 1969, p. 1061)Neurotransmitters and their analogs are not the only compounds withthe ability to bond to nucleic acids. One of the best-studied of such com-pounds is the acridine proflavin (fig. 8); note its similarity to harmine (cf.fig. 3). This compound binds by interaction between the base pairs of thedouble helix, resulting in a partial unwinding of the helix in the region ofthe intercalated molecule. Intercalated molecules are thought to be heldin place by strong electronic interactions with the base pairs above andbelow the drug, and this results in a stabilization of the helix, as measuredin the higher temperature required to denature intercalated DNA (New-ton 1970).Smythies has elsewhere theorized in even greater detail as to the natureof the 5HT bond site and possible points of comparison between 5HTand its hallucinogenic analogs:file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (92 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmThus 5HT could bond to ordered single-strand RNA by intercala-tion (that is, pi-cloud overlap) between adjacent purine bases andtwo hydrogen bonds (hydroxyl to ribose ring O and ribose OH).It could bind to helical DNA by intercalation between base pairsand one hydrogen bond (either NH to deoxyribose ring O orhydroxyl H to the other deoxyribose ring), but it is not wideenough a molecule to bind to both. And it could bind to helicalRNA by intercalation and no less than four hydrogen bonds . . .[see fig. 9].The hallucinogenic derivatives of tryptamine are characterizedby partial blockade of the bonding groups so that, whereas thecompound can still bind to the site and prevent the subsequentattachment of 5HT, it does so without inducing the agonist effect.Blockade of the active groups is affected by the following means:(1) dialkylation of the amino group. This reduces ionic and hydro-gen bonding and imposes additional steric effects. The N cannotapproach so closely to the bonding atom (01), and the result will bethat the indole ring will not occupy precisely the same place in thesite as in the case of 5HT. The function of 5HT in this site may beconcerned with charge-transfer reactions. As the pi-cloud energy in5HT is concentrated in the 2 position the resulting slight displace-ment of the indole ring in the bonding of such drugs as dimethyl-tryptamine may disrupt this charge transfer process. A possibletarget in this site for the transfer of charge would be a hydrogen ofthe superjacent base pair (joining, e.g., the N of guanine to the Oof cytosine) and thus the action of 5HT in the site might be to dis-rupt the H bond and thus initiate the separation of the two strandsof a helical RNA. (Smythies 1969, p. 265)In Smythies's model, the postulated ability of 5HT, or one of its ana-logs, to open the ionic channel by intercalating into an RNA receptor siteis based on the capacity to form a charge-transfer complex with the nu-cleic acid. The charge-transfer mechanism will be of central significancein the presentation of our own model in the pages following. Therefore, afew general comments on charge-transfer complexes in living systemsseem warranted. We encountered such comments in the observations ofAlbert Szent-Gyorgyi (i960):file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (93 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmCharge-transfer allows us to transfer an electron from one sub-stance to another without major loss in energy, since it does notrequire a rearrangement in molecular structure . . .By charge-transfer relatively inactive molecules may acquirea high reactivity.

A charge-transfer complex is somethingbetween a regular closed-shell molecule and a free radical, andthe great reactivity of free radicals need not be emphasized. Ifthe complex dissociates, as happens in extreme cases, two real freeradicals are formed.An acceptor may accept an electron also from a saturated energyband, thus creating a hole and rendering the band conductant.Conversely, a donor may donate an electron to an empty energyband, rendering this bond conductant. So charge-transfer opensthe way for semiconduction into biology . . .In valency saturated compounds electrons occupy orbitals inpairs. Electrons have their spin, and a spinning electron is a tinymagnet. Since the two electrons occupying the same orbital alwaysspin in opposite directions, they cancel out each other's magneticmoments. However, if the two electrons become separated, asmay be the case in a strong charge-transfer, they may no longercompensate one another, rendering the substance paramagnetic:as soon as the two electrons are no longer strongly coupled, andoccupy different orbitals, they become relieved of the limitationfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (95 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmof the Pauli principle according to which two electrons, forming apair on the same orbital, must spin in opposite directions. If oneof the two unoccupied electrons reverts its spin, the complex goesinto the triplet state, adding a paramagnetic component. . .There are two methods for detecting paramagnetic behavior:the magnetic balance and the electron spin resonance (ESR). Theformer is rather crude as compared to the latter. The signal givenin ESR depends on circumstances. Free radicals given a sharpand high ESR signal extending over 10-50 gauss. If the electronis close to other unpaired electrons, it will be perturbed and maygive a broad signal. Exposed to the magnetic influence of differentnuclei it may split up, giving a hyperfine structure . . . How fara charge-transfer complex will give a signal depends on circum-stances. In a weak transfer the two electrons remain strongly cou-pled, and so give no ESR signal, or give a signal only under strongillumination. (pp. 67-72)Szent-Gyorgyi continues on to point out that the strength of the ESRsignal given by a charge-transfer complex will be in direct proportion tothe strength of the charge transfer. If strong reductants are used as donorsand strong oxidants as acceptors, then the ESR signal will be correspond-ingly stronger.What possible significance could the formation of charge-transfer com-plexes in living systems have? The following comments on its possible rolein drug action are relevant here:We may ask, for instance, whether charge-transfer is not involvedin drug action, some of the drugs acting as electron donors or ac-ceptors. It is difficult to predict the biological effects of such acharge-transfer, for the action will not only depend on the ques-tion, whether electrons are donated or tapped off, but will also de-pend on the site of action. The cellular membrane, for instance,which dominates many functions of the cell, has mostly a negativecharge inside and a positive one outside. So electrons donated atthe inside should increase the charge and lead to hyperpolariza-tion, and with it to inhibition, while electrons donated at the out-side will decrease the potential and can be expected to causefile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (96 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmexcitation. The opposite will hold for electron acceptors. We canbe prepared also to meet paradoxical results. Let us suppose that abiological substance acts by donating electrons. A drug, acting asan electron donor, may compete with a natural substance for itsacceptor interfering thus with the normal course of electron trans-mission, this drug though itself a donor, may produce an effectwhich corresponds to the inhibition of electron donation. In spiteof all these incertitudes we may expect one definite interrelation:If a substance exerts its biological activity by accepting or donat-ing electrons, then it should have exceptional donor or acceptorproperties. (Szent-Gyorgyi 1960, p. 1071)Considering the preceding information relevant to charge-transfer com-plexes, we may ask the question: Are serotonin and its analogs likely can-didates for participation in the formation of charge-transfer complexeswith nucleic acids, as was suggested by Smythies? We again refer to Szent-Gyorgyi (1960) for a decidedly affirmative answer:Although serotonin is a somewhat stronger donor than indole, orsome of its derivatives such as tryptamine, this extraordinary reac-tivity is characteristic for the indole formation in general and is inno way explained by the energy values of the highest filled molecu-lar orbital. . . There seem to be other hitherto unknown molecularindices which entail this extraordinary reactivity. There is but onegeneral statement we can safely make about all this, and this is thatif Nature developed a substance for electron transfer, then she mayhave given to this substance extraordinary qualities, which make itlikely that Nature developed this ring naturally for services of thiskind . . .... It was shown that indoles are exceptionally good donors,and a great number of biologically active substances contain anindole ring (serotonin, lysergic acid, bufotenin, indole acetic acid).Attempts were made earlier by Popov, Castellani-Oisi, and M.Craft to connect pharmacological activity, like convulsant effect,with electron donation. That indoles may actually act in their bio-logical reactions as electron donors is further suggested by the factthat the OH group, induced into the serotonin molecule at posi-tion 5 equally increases pharmacological activity and the electron-file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (97 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmdonating property. Serotonin is one of the strongest donors I evermet, though the k of the highest filled orbital is but moderatelylower than that of indole (0.461). So there are still unidentifiedmolecular parameters which greatly influence donor acceptorproperties. (pp. 84-85, 108)The possible ability of nucleic acids or nucleoprotein to function as ac-ceptors is also touched upon by Szent-Gyorgyi (1960) in the following:As the last item on my list of the peculiarities of the living state I would like to touch upon one of the most intriguing observa-tions of the last years, that of the very broad (ESR) signal givenby nucleoproteins (Blumenfeld, Kalmanson, and Shen-Pei). Thissignal (if really due to the protein-nucleic acid complex) indicatesa density of unpaired electrons which is almost comparable tothat found in metals, to which metals owe their conductivity. Thisfinding, if corroborated, may lift a veil which now obscures thereal nature and meaning of protein, nucleic acid, and nucleo-protein. (p. 134)At this point, let us summarize briefly what has been discussed so far.We began the first section of this chapter by discussing the functions ofneurotransmitters in the nervous system, and their probable chemical na-ture. We noted the structural similarities between many hallucinogensand the presumed neurotransmitters. The technical problems faced in anyattempt to study neurotransmitters in the central nervous system werepointed out, and the indirect evidence implicating serotonin and norepi-nephrine as the major central transmitters was cited. We presented a dia-gram of synaptic events and current theories suggesting that drugs mayfunction as false transmitters. The parallelism between regional uptake ofdrugs and the concentration of neurotransmitters in the brain was noted.Next, we discussed enzymatic mechanisms and the evidence that hallu-cinogens may arise endogenously. This led to a discussion of the possiblerole of the pineal, both its overall function as a regulatory mechanismof the nervous system and its possible implication in the origination ofendogenous hallucinogens. In the second section of our exposition, we fo-cused on the question of drug action at the receptor site. We cited prob-lems inherent in this study and discussed Smythies's theory of a possibleRNA or ribonucleoprotein receptor site. We noted that this could havefile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (98 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmfunctional consequences through alteration of the torsion of the RNAhelix and the formation of charge-transfer complexes. The modes of bind-ing of 5HT and its analogs to nucleic acids were considered in some depth.Finally, we considered the nature and significance of charge-transfer com-plexes in living systems and noted that indoles are excellent electrondonors, while nucleic acids are equally efficient electron acceptors. Here itwas also noted that strong charge-transfer complexes, such as would be ex-pected in a nucleic acid indole complex, are characterized by a very strongESR signal. It has been necessary to quote other authorities at such greatlength in the preceding pages to provide the reader with a basic grasp ofmany fundamental concepts and problems, which are essential to an un-derstanding of the speculation that is to follow.Having reached this point, we can now present our own hypothesisin broad outline. It is basically the following: What we experience asthought or consciousness has its physical basis in quantum-mechanicalphenomena. We propose that the intercalation of 5HT, other neurotrans-mitters, and hallucinogenic neurotransmitter analogs into an RNA recep-tor site gives rise to three important consequences. The first of these,already proposed by Smythies, is that the intercalation forms a charge-transfer complex, which initiates the separation of the helix by polarizingthe base pairs; this allows charged ions to rush through the membrane. Wespeculate that this intercalation may have two additional consequences.The first is that the rapid bonding and debonding of intercalators causes arapid twisting and untwisting of the helix, and this gives rise to a vibratoryoscillation of the macromolecule. This oscillation, occurring within theelectrical field at the synapse, has the effect of generating an electromag-netic waveform. This signal, however, becomes absorbed at certain fre-quencies by low-energy electrons present in the charge-transfer complexes,which are formed by neurotransmitters intercalating into the RNA. Thisabsorption of energy serves to modulate the signal and simultaneously sat-urates the energy bands in the charge-transfer complex, canceling the po-larization of the base pairs, allowing the RNA strands to rejoin. Exactlythis sort of absorption phenomenon is observed in electron spin reso-nance spectrometry, so we can refer to the proposed process as an ESReffect or an ESR signal.Our speculation contends that the combination of modulated electro-magnetic waveforms originating from the tens of millions of synapses ac-file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (99 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmtivated at any one time is detectable to the organism by some hithertounsuspected mechanism (possibly akin to holography) as a higher corticalexperience, as thought or consciousness. Further, the signals thus gener-ated by the nucleic acid—indole complex are reflective of the continuallychanging conformational topology of the nucleic acid or nucleoprotein asit exists in its superhelixed, in vivo state. The ESR signal generated by thismechanism might be capable of carrying information that somehowwould be experienced as thought. Such information probably does notoriginate from the level of base pair organization, the level of the molecu-lar code involved in genetic processes such as replication; this could notconvey much in the way of experience to the organism. What seemsmore likely is that the information content of the signal is generated bythe dynamic conformational changes taking place at the secondary andtertiary structural levels in the receptor. Nucleic acid in the test tube is fardifferent from nucleic acid in its superhelixed condition in a nucleus ormembrane. In its functioning, in vivo condition, it must be the site of fu-rious molecular activity relating to a diversity of processes: protein synthe-sis, replication, charge transfer, intercalation, deintercalation, changes intorsion; all of this and more must be occurring constantly and simultane-ously in living nucleic acid. Perhaps included in these regulatory functionsis the production of an electromagnetic signal that is modulated by anESR absorption effect. The modulation of this signal might be correlatedto experience; it would then be a continually unfolding readout of thebioelectronic state of the neural network, experienced as the informa-tional gestalten of mind and its models of the internal and external world.To clarify the concepts associated with this speculation, it is necessaryto digress into a discussion of the nature of the paramagnetic propertiesfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (100 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (101 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htm file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (102 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htm file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (103 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmof the correct resonance frequency. This will then supply energy tothe unpaired electrons in the lower energy level, exciting them tothe upper level and reversing their spins in the process. Thisabsorption of energy by the electrons as they jump to the higherlevel can be detected as an actual reduction in the power of theelectromagnetic radiation passing through the system, and thisabsorption can then be displayed on an oscilloscope screen, or inany other way that is normal in absorption spectroscopy. (pp. 3—6)Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a similar type of paramagneticphenomenon. Like ESR, NMR involves the generation of a signal by theapplication of an external magnetic field, except that in NMR, shifts in theorientation of the nucleus, rather than of the unpaired electrons, are mea-sured with respect to the external field (cf. Dyer 1965). The major point forour discussion, which would indicate that ESR rather than NMR wouldfunction as the modulated carrier-wave, is that unpaired electrons are char-acteristic of charge-transfer reactions and semiconduction, and as we haveseen previously, serotonin and many of its analogs can function as power-ful electron donors and thus may give rise to charge transfer and semicon-duction in neural RNA. NMR may be involved as well as ESR in thesephenomena, but the signal preceding from NMR would seem to be lessspecifically characteristic of the kind of quantum-mechanical interactionsthat we hypothesize are necessary to generate a modulated waveform.We have seen from the observations of Szent-Gyorgyi that a strongcharge-transfer complex, such as may be formed by the intercalation of anindole neurotransmitter into a nucleic acid receptor, can act to separatethe electrons in the substance into two energy groups: a high-energygroup with their spins aligned antiparallel to the magnetic vector of theelectrical field, and a low-energy group aligned parallel to the direction ofthe magnetic field. Thus, the charge-transfer complex possesses all theprior conditions needed to trigger an ESR absorption effect if electro-magnetic energy of appropriate frequency is passed through the system.We speculate that in the synapse this is exactly what happens: An electro-magnetic wave of the correct resonance frequency is produced through acoupled electromechanical oscillation of the receptor and becomes modu-lated by absorption at certain frequencies. We propose that intercalationof the neurotransmitter causes this oscillation, as well as the formation ofthe charge-transfer complex; the rapid bonding and debonding of the in-file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (104 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmtercalator causes rapid changes in torsion of the helix, giving rise to oscil-lation. Since this oscillation takes place in the electrical field present at thesynapse, it possesses an electromagnetic component.The interaction between the nucleic acid receptor and its intercalatorscould thus act as a self-contained ESR circuit: with charge transfer, on theone hand, to provide the magnetic field necessary to polarize the free elec-trons; and rapid oscillation in an electrical field, on the other hand, togenerate the absorption effect that characterizes ESR. This absorption ef-fect will take place only at certain frequencies, namely, those frequenciescorresponding to the energy difference between the two magneticallyaligned groups of electrons in the nucleic acid receptor; selective absorp-tion at these frequencies could informationally modulate the wave.The electromagnetic waves currently used in ESR spectrometry areradar frequencies ranging from 9,000 Mc/s to 36,000 Mc/s, which corre-spond to wavelengths between 3.2 cm and 8 mm. The corresponding mag-netic field strengths range from 3,300 to 13,000 gauss. According to Ingram(1969), however, ESR absorption effects can be manifested using radio fre-quencies as low as 28 Mc/s in magnetic fields of 10 gauss. Szent-Gyorgyi(1960) has stated that free radicals show an ESR absorption effect in mag-netic fields from 10 to 50 gauss. It is not clear whether macromolecularoscillation could generate the frequencies required to trigger the energy ab-sorption that characterizes the ESR signal. An experimental approach tothis model might investigate this question. To our knowledge, the possibil-ity that macromolecular substrates oscillating in an electrical field may becapable of electromagnetic emissions at radar or shortwave-radio frequen-cies has not yet been investigated. It is possible that very much lower fieldstrengths and frequencies would suffice to produce ESR effects in singlemacromolecules. Until experimental data is forthcoming this hypothesismust, of course, remain hypothesis.Given, for the sake of the argument, the assumptions that (1) an elec-tromagnetic wave of appropriate frequency is generated in the mannerpostulated, and that (2) this wave is modulated through absorption bycharge-transfer complexes, the model still must address two questions.The first one is, through what mechanism could the organism detect themodulated carrier-wave? Second, what sort of information could be car-ried by the wave?file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (105 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmWe can suggest an answer to the first question by referring to the stud-ies, cited earlier, that show that the pineal gland is sensitive to sound,photic stimuli, temperature, and X rays. We suggest that the pineal couldalso function as a transducer for the detection of ESR in a feedback-typemechanism; the pineal could act as an antenna by detecting a modulatedelectromagnetic carrier-wave and converting it to a modulated spatiotem-poral pattern of nerve impulses, much as a radio converts electromagneticwaves to sound. In this way the information carried by the signal wouldbe reflected by modulated firing in populations of synapses; this modu-lated firing would in turn give rise to further modulated ESR signals(since the signal arises from processes involved in synaptic transmission),which would then trigger further modulated neural patterns. In this waythis feedback mechanism could give rise to self-propagating, evolvingneural processes that we experience as thought, memory, or perception. Itis also conceivable that the pineal may be receptive to the ESR signals ofother organisms as well as those of its owner. Thus, it could act as a recep-tor for the ESR strum of the biotic community and function to effec-tively integrate an organism into its ecology.The question of the kind of information that the signal would carry ismore difficult to answer. If the signal is generated by electromechanicaloscillation of the receptor, which then becomes modulated by ESR ab-sorption, then the signal should reflect the internal electronic state of thereceptor, which in turn will reflect conformational changes taking placefrom instant to instant in the macromolecule. We postulate that thesechanges in helical torsion and tertiary topology are not merely randomfluctuations but are correlated with internal and external inputs, and,thus, model perceptions, thoughts, and memories. Is it possible thatoverlapping ESRs arising from macromolecular changes occurring atmany synapses could take the form of highly structured (perhaps helical)standing waveforms? Such waveforms can be viewed as spatiotemporalcrystals having a vibratory structure (cf. Abraham 1972). Just this sort ofspatiotemporal structure constitutes a holographic image, and we havenoted in the previous chapter that holography seems analogous to mindin many respects.Support for our contention that experience can somehow inducechanges in macromolecules can be found in current theoretical models oflearning and memory. These models are based on the concept that thefile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (106 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmstorage of memory and learned behavior is mediated by changes in RNAand proteins present in the neurons. Findings showing a rise in RNA andprotein synthesis following learning have furnished support for thesemodels (Hyden 1968, p. 88). Hyden (1968) has proposed the followingmodel for memory storage, which rests on the notion that conformationalchanges of macromolecules in an electrical field could be significant:I would like to suggest that the redundancy of the gene productsprovides a basis for the necessary richness of proteins serving asa mechanism for the storage of memories. Learning and experi-ence lead to a further differentiation of brain cells. Additionalgene areas become active under the influence of environmentalfactors. This leads to a synthesis of a greater number of RNAspecies and proteins slightly differing from each other. Thedetailed mechanism which gives rise to these events may be thefollowing. The external factors give rise to firing at modulatedfrequencies in the sensory ganglia and brain stem areas, includingthe limbic area. The modulated frequencies can split into a quad-rature component and a vector component. I suggest that the 90degree vector has a phase shift relative to the quadrature compo-nent. The two variables, the frequency and the phase shift, imparta high information content to such an electrical pattern, whichmay be decisive for the specificity of its effect. In principle, thiseffect consists in the production of a change in the ionic equilib-rium through field changes. In the nuclear compartment thesefield changes give rise to conformational changes: activatingenzyme proteins which in turn induce synthesis of RNA fromnew areas. (p. 97)The possibility that neurotransmitters might induce conformationalchanges in macromolecules is shown by the following passage:Elkes drew attention to an older hypothesis concerning the pur-ported action of 5HT on the motility of glia. While the evidencefor this effect was tenuous, he felt strongly that the existence ofcontractile elements in the central nervous system areas should beseriously considered. These contractions might involve anythingfrom the folding and coiling of an ordered polymer, forming partof a lipoprotein or mucoprotein lattice at a junctional site, to afile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (107 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmvisible contraction recognizable by light microscopy. He pro-posed the term micromechanical for such phenomena and won-dered whether the so-called neurohumoral substances could notplay a regulatory role in the specificity of such phenomena. Thewell-known sensitivity of contractile tissues to agents such as 5HT(or ACh, or NE) might be extreme examples of a deeper and moregeneralized biological effect at a micellar level. . . (Smythies, inSchmitt et al. 1971, pp. 25-26)It must be conceded that these tentative models for learning and mem-ory are concerned with neural functions far from those presumed to be in-volved with the interaction of serotonin or an analogous hallucinogenwith its receptor site. However, the fact that the hallucinogenically in-duced state represents a novel learning experience and at times results inan alteration in behavior patterns indicates that the processes effected byhallucinogens (synaptic transmission) may indeed have some influence onlearning and memory mechanisms. Just such a possibility has been sug-gested by Kety (1968). It seems that the question must remain unresolvedat present, since the significance of macromolecular changes occurring inneurotransmission and memory storage is not well understood. The infor-mation we have cited, however, does seem to indicate that such changesmay function in both the processing and the storage of neural input.One question that has not yet been considered and that unfortunatelyhas been discussed only very sparingly in the literature is that of whetherneural DNA, as well as RNA, could be involved in neurotransmission ormemory mechanisms, and of what possible function it might have. Thefollowing observation with regard to DNA is suggestive:The nerve cells share a rare characteristic with a few other cells ofthe organism. They do not divide. Over the life-cycle, therefore,orderliness is not maintained by means of cell division. There willbe an increasing danger of errors at synthesis in the cells, whichmeans error in function. Evidence has been presented that neu-rons may renew their DNA without preparing for division (Pelc1964). Future studies will have to elucidate what happens in agingneurons, since hybridization analyses have suggested that DNAfrom an old animal may not be identical with DNA from a younganimal (Hahn 1966).file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (108 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htm. . . We have, therefore, as a first step, prepared brain DNA ofvarying degrees of purity. This DNA was injected into the ven-tricles of the brain of other animals of the same species. In onehour, protein synthesis was found to increase significantly. Bio-chemical analyses showed that the DNA had been incorporated inthe recipient's brain cells in a polymerized state . . . (H. Hyden, inKoestler and Smythies 1969, p. 102)It may be relevant to mention here the commonplace within the disci-pline of genetics—that only 2 to 5 percent of the genome is active at anyone time, that these inactive areas can be activated by external (i.e., extra-cellular) factors such as hormones, and that large populations of similarnucleotide sequences exist in the DNA complements of higher organisms.It is possible to speculate on a memory mechanism, based on an interac-tion of intercalating amines and neural DNA, that would function onprinciples similar to the intercalator/RNA interaction that may be in-volved in neural transmission. The remainder of this chapter is concernedwith a discussion of such a speculation.For the sake of hypothesis, let us suppose that serotonin and its analogsinteract with RNA at the receptor site, much in the manner postulated bySmythies, the question of the effect this could have on ESR being mo-mentarily disregarded. We have seen from Smythies's model that seroton-in intercalating into the RNA could cause a separation of the nucleotidestrands and thus open an ionic shutter facilitating the passage ofcharged ions, and perhaps biogenic amines themselves, through the mem-brane. The preceding evidence cited indicates that injected DNA can be-come incorporated and polymerized in brain cells; therefore, nucleotidesmust be able to cross the neural membrane and also the nuclear mem-brane. Conventional intracellular enzymes probably facilitate the crossingof the nuclear membrane, but a mechanism facilitating outer membranepassage is more difficult to imagine. It seems possible, however, that theRNA shutter mechanism could allow the transport of small molecules,such as neurotransmitters or nucleotides, across the postsynaptic mem-brane. Once these molecules have penetrated the postsynaptic membraneand entered the cytoplasm of the axon, they could be transported to thevicinity of the nucleus by the mechanism of axoplasmic flow:Evidently there is some highly organized transport mechanism. Itfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (109 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmhas long been known that nerve fibers are not just tubes filledwith some protein jelly, but that they contain many fine struc-tures, neurofibrils and neurotubules that run along their length. It ispostulated by Ochs that after manufacture in the cell body themacromolecules are loaded onto these tubules and fibrils andtravel along by some sliding mechanism, hence the uniform rate.(Eccles 1973, p. 171)Although studies of this chemical transport mechanism have focusedon the transport of macromolecules from the nucleus in the cell body tothe synapse via the axon, Eccles goes on to state that reverse transport,from the axon to the cell body, does take place.Could it be that neurotransmitters that penetrate in this manner be-come intercalated into the nuclear DNA of the neuron? This would seemto be at least a possibility and would appear to be a function of the abilityof the amine to cross the membrane; that is, those amines would be se-lected for intercalation by (1) their ability to cross the membrane and (2)their capacity for intercalation. Thus, while certain amines present at thereceptor site (e.g., serotonin) might intercalate into the RNA and open theshutter, others might penetrate to the nucleus via the channel thusformed and intercalate into the DNA. This postulated intercalation mighthave two alternative effects. The intercalators might initiate separation ofthe nucleotide strands through charge transfer, and thus function as induc-tors for RNA synthesis. Alternatively, if the bound intercalators had the ef-fect of stabilizing the helix in the manner of proflavin, rather thanseparating it, then it would seem that those portions of DNA involved inintercalation would be unavailable for transcription. These portions, then,would constitute the closed areas of the neural genome, which subsequentmolecular events could render open to synthesis. This suggests one possi-ble mechanism by which the base sequence of neural DNA could be al-tered without necessitating an actual change of structure; that is, givenone situation in which amines are intercalated at particular sites on theDNA, then subsequently these amines could debond from some of thesesites and bond into different sites, thus coding a memory or learnedbehavior and simultaneously rendering formerly silent areas of thegenome available for transcription and silencing formerly active areas.This would seem to amount to about the same effect as a restructuring ofbase sequences but has the advantage of not requiring an actual change infile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (110 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmneural DNA.On the other hand, if an ESR readout mechanism, such as that dis-cussed previously, plays a role in making molecularly encoded informationavailable to consciousness, an intercalation into neural DNA-inducingcharge transfer would then render the intercalated portions open to per-ception via ESR. Subsequent debonding and rebonding of the amines todifferent sites would be reflected in a changed ESR signal. The RNAwould also, of course, be expected to exhibit a change in its ESR, whichwould reflect the change in its structure initiated by the opening to tran-scription of hitherto blocked DNA sequences.Clearly, problems are involved with experimental approaches to thismodel. One of the most difficult is the question of determining whichamines bond at which sites. For instance, does serotonin bond into bothRNA at the membrane and DNA at the nucleus, or one or the other? Thisamounts to asking, are certain amines specific intercalators for RNA,while others are specific for DNA? Or, can several species of amine bondinto both sites? How might these alternatives be reflected in ESR if such amechanism operates in the organism? At present, the only approaches tosome of these questions are speculative.We have chosen to present one such speculation. As noted in the dis-cussion of bonding sites for indoles to nucleic acids, some compoundsappear to bind better to DNA than to RNA. One such compound isharmine, and its affinity for DNA is not surprising in view of its previouslymentioned similarity to proflavin. It is possible, therefore, that harmine orone of its analogs, such as 6-methoxytetrahydroharman, would exhibit asuperior capability to bond to DNA if it were enabled to cross the mem-brane. Perhaps in the normal organism, the DNA is unintercalated by anycompounds, or perhaps serotonin is the normal intercalator. When a hal-lucinogen such as harmine or LSD is introduced into the system, eitherfrom an endogenous source or from the external environment, it mayshow a greater affinity for the DNA than serotonin and bond in place of it;a stronger charge-transfer reaction may result and may produce an ampli-fied ESR signal, facilitating greater access to stored memories and subcon-scious contents. Thus, a population using harmine or similar compoundsin shamanic and religious practices, or an organism capable of synthesizingsuch highly reactive compounds internally, might well be afforded a tre-file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (111 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmmendous evolutionary advantage, as it would possess an enhanced access tothe informational gestalten of its own holographic genetic storage system.It is also conceivable that the bonding of harmine or an analogouscompound into DNA could form permanent bonds maintained by aform of superconductivity and, thus, function in the formation and main-tenance of long-term memory. We have seen that compounds such asproflavin and presumably harmine have the effect of stabilizing the helixthrough strong pi-cloud overlap. Superconductivity could maintain suchbonds indefinitely and thus ensure the longevity of long-term memorystorage; it could also be involved as a mechanism for producing highlyamplified ESRs from molecular substrates. The contents of long-termmemories thus encoded could perhaps be selectively recalled by propermodulation of the ESR signal, by either reinforcing it or canceling it; thismay be accomplished by the formation of RNA-indole complexes withESRs in phase with the particular DNA ESR. The question of whethersuperconductivity may play a role in living processes deserves further in-vestigation. Many of the ordering principles of living systems do seem tohave many similarities to low-temperature systems (cf. Little 1965).Naturally, the hypothetical model presented possesses its own peculiarproblems in terms of experimental approaches, and any definitive confir-mation or disconfirmation of the model would seem to depend on thedevelopment of very much more sophisticated biochemical and ESRtechniques. We felt, however, that at least parts of the theory presentedcould be subjected to an operational test. The experimental proceduresinvolved in this test, and the at least partially affirmative results obtained,are the subject matter of the next chapter.Our rather freewheeling series of speculations on the molecularprocesses that may form the physical basis of mind is concluded at thispoint. We have postulated that internal and external inputs may be corre-lated to macromolecular changes and quantum-mechanical events thatform the physical basis of mind. To say they are the physical basis ofmind, however, is not to equate them to mind; this is the error of reduc-tionism. The quantum-mechanical mechanisms we have discussed mayhave some properties homologous to the properties of mind as we experi-ence it. However, mind is probably an expression of laws operating on ahierarchical level superordinate to that represented by organisms; hence,it is to be expected that it will exemplify some properties not to be foundat the level of organisms alone. These are properties transcending thefile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (112 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmboundary conditions of organism and are those properties that makemind irreducible to physical or even organic structure. It is probable thatthe properties peculiar to mind introduce additional boundary conditionson subordinate levels, the organismic, molecular, and submolecular, sothat the physical basis of mind—whatever it may be—has certain of itsqualities determined by mind. If ESR forms the physical basis of mind, itprobably possesses unique qualities that we would not find in the phe-nomenon as it is observed in the laboratory. But this relationship cannever be reciprocal: Mind may determine some additional properties ofESR or whatever physical process operates at the interface of moleculesand mind, but molecules and physical process, however complex, cannever, by themselves, determine mind.Chapter 6An Experiment at La ChorreraDuring the course of our investigation of the shamanic dimension, our at-tention was drawn to a report of ayahuasca usage among the Jivaro (Harner1968); the shamans, under the influence of potent monoamine oxidase-inhibiting, harmine- and tryptamine-containing Banisteriopsis infusions,are said to produce a fluorescent violet substance by means of which theyaccomplish all their magic. Though invisible to ordinary perception, thisfluid is said to be visible to anyone who has ingested the infusion.Ayahuasca is frequently associated with violet auras and deep blue halluci-nations; this suggests that ayahuasca may enable one to see at ultravioletwavelengths, and that this substance may be visible only in the ultravioletpart of the spectrum. We also had occasion to ingest synthetic tryptaminesand had observed as a regular feature of the tryptamine intoxication a pe-culiar audile phenomenon. This is a very faint, but definitely perceivable,harmonic overtone of varying pitch and frequency that seems to emanatefrom inside the skull while one is under the influence of tryptamines; theexact nature of this harmonic tone eludes precise verbal description, as itvaries in quality and amplitude during the course of the tryptamine experi-ence, first manifesting itself as an extremely faint sound on the very edge ofaudibility, rather akin to the sound that might proceed from distant windchimes. This sound gradually increases in volume a very few minutes afterit is perceived, taking on an electric, buzzing quality that might be com-pared in some respects to whistling wind or running water.

One such fea-ture is the specific association of this phenomenon with the ingestion ofhallucinogens with structures close to tryptamine, that is, the psilocybin-DMT compounds and the harmine-tetrahydroharmine complex found inBanisteriopsis caapi and B. rusbyana. The reports of similar phenomenabeing noted for mescaline or the lysergamides are rare; while, according toNaranjo (in Efron et al. 1967, p. 389), approximately 50 percent of the sub-jects under the influence of ayahuasca (B. caapi) commonly experience anextremely loud buzzing sound, emanating from the interior of the skull,file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (114 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htm file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (115 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htm file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (116 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmduring the course of the experience. Individual reports of the subjectivelyperceived phenomenon exhibit a high degree of similarity.Our desire to pursue the investigation of this audile phenomenon atgreater depth, combined with the curiosity and incredulity that Harner'sreport had aroused, led us to travel, in March of 1971, to the tiny missionsettlement of La Chorrera, forty-three minutes south, seventy-three de-grees west, on the banks of the Rio Igara-parana in Comisaria Amazonas,Colombia. We felt that here we could carry out firsthand observationsinto the phenomenology of the tryptamine dimension. This region is wellrepresented in endemic species of tryptamine-bearing psychoactive plants,among them Virola theiodora and other Virola species, Psychotria viridis,Banisteriopsis caapi (fig. 12) and B. rusbyana, and a lowland variety ofStropharia cubensis mushrooms (fig. 13) that we found to be particularlyrich in phosphorylated tryptamines. Other minor psychoactive agentswere also in widespread aboriginal use in this area, tobacco and cocabeing the most important in this respect, but these played no part in ourexperiments.Ingestion of Stropharia cubensis, on a number of separate occasions,showed it to be of low toxicity and very nearly ideal for easy manifestationof the interior cerebral tone. We speculated that the tone is directly causedby the metabolism of the tryptamines within the cerebral matrix andmight be the electron spin resonance of the metabolizing tryptamine mol-ecules within the nervous system, somehow amplified to audible levels. Wediscovered that it was possible to closely imitate these tones with the voiceby sounding harmonic vocal tones that quickly adjusted to the interiorsounds as they moved from the audible into the ultrasonic range. Usingthis knowledge, it was possible to produce a vocal sound that seemed toamplify the harmonic tones perceivable inside the cranium. The vocal pro-duction of the sounds seems to rest on specific effects of the tryptamineson the motor nerves, particularly those governing the facial and vocal mus-cles. As with ayahuasca, an interior sound is commonly heard, which quiteoften triggers a spontaneous burst of imitative vocalizings, markedly unlikeany conventional human speech or facial contortions. The tryptaminescan apparently trigger a kind of rippling of facial muscles, which results inthe production of a vocally modulated pressure wave.What is more startling is that the sound, which gains in energy thelonger it is sustained, can actually become visible—as if the vibrationalfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (117 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmwave patterns were shifting into the visible spectrum or inducing a vibra-tional excitation of the air in such a way as to affect light diffraction.These observations suggested that although the wave is produced withfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (118 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmFIGURE 13Stropharia cubensis (Earle) played a major role in the experiment at La Chorrera.These mushrooms grow gregariously on cow dung of the common species ofIndian humped cattle (Bos indicus) and in this author's experience rarely occur inany other situation. The original type was discovered in Cuba in June of 1904.Stropharia cubensis has been reported from Florida, Puerto Rico, Oaxaca, BritishHonduras, Trinidad, Colombia, Bolivia, Argentina, and Indochina. The majorpsychoactive constituent has been identified by Hofmann et al. (1959) as psilocy-bin, that is, 4-phosphoryloxy-N, N-dimethyltryptamine.

This peculiar wavephenomenon will continue to be generated out of the mouth and nostrilsand will be visible in the surrounding air as long as the vocalizations arecontinued. Working from the hypothesis that this visible phenomenonmight somehow proceed from the interior harmonic tones made audiblethrough the ingestion of tryptamines, and further speculating that thesetones might be caused by the electron spin resonance of the metabolizingtryptamines within the nervous system, our task became one of attempt-ing to determine how vocally imitating molecular ESR could produce avisible standing wave and, further, of attempting to describe just what thiswave might be in physical terms.The temporal process of metabolism leads in the human brain to a spe-cial kind of phenomenon, which is thought, and the nature and texture ofthis thought is affected and altered in relation to what specific metabolicprocesses are occurring within the brain. For instance, the physicochemi-cal state of the brain during stage IV sleep is different than when drugs arecycling in the brain, and each of these metabolic states has its special,unique form of consciousness attributed to it. It is no longer tenable to re-gard these processes of consciousness merely as an epiphenomenal reflec-tion of the metabolic processes occurring simultaneously within the brain.It has been found (cf. Dicara 1970; Green et al. 1970) that this process is atwo-way exchange: Metabolism gives rise to special kinds of potentiatedenergy states within an organism, but these energy states reflect and, infile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (119 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmsome degree, determine what kinds of metabolic processes will occur.It is not easy to know to what degree metabolic process is determinableby consciousness. To assert that thought can control chemical reactions inthe nervous system may seem peculiar on the surface, but it is inherentlyno less peculiar to say that it cannot intrude on the external world as acausal force. Clearly, thought does have causal effect; reality, as we per-ceive it, is largely shaped by the artifacts, both material and symbolic, ofthought. Therefore, that thought can have no direct influence on thephysical texture of reality is perhaps an unjustifiable assumption, for suchan assumption implies that one has prior knowledge as to the boundaryconditions of the interface of mind and the world. The question must re-main an open one. We are reminded of Whitehead's observation that elec-trons blindly run either within or without the body, but within the bodythey blindly run according to the conditions of the body, and thought isamong these conditions. The position that thought does in fact exertsome influence over quantum events was included in our repertoire of op-erational constructs.The brain is an extremely complex matrix of electrochemical circuitrythat reacts peculiarly in the presence of certain kinds of tryptamines (butrequires other tryptamines, such as serotonin, to function normally). Thebizarre mental phenomena caused by tryptamines are probably related to adisturbance of normal tryptamine metabolism. It is clear that the purelychemical interaction between drug and brain occurs within the cerebralmatrix. The mind, however, can be viewed as the temporal overstructure of the brain, which manifests, through time, in processes such as menta-tion, memory, and dreams. By affecting the temporal process of metabo-lism in the neural matrix, psychedelic drugs affect, as well, changes in itstemporal overstructure, that is, mind. This suggests that psychoactive mol-ecules may also possess a temporal aspect, which only manifests in theirmetabolic cycling. A static molecular diagram is essentially a misleadingconcept, for it can show only the physical configuration of a particularmolecule. In fact, that molecule, as it functions in nature, is but one stageor structural configuration in the metabolic processes occurring within theliving tissues of all organisms. We felt that this relationship was a reciprocalone, and that mind, through a conscious intervention into temporal pro-cess, could determine the outcome of certain events on the metabolic level.This understanding of the mechanics of metabolism was combinedfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (120 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmwith the notion that the sound that manifests inside the brain under theinfluence of tryptamines originated from the ESR created by the process oftheir intercalating into the neural DNA. We reasoned that it would be pos-sible to trigger specific chemical reactions with the voice by harmonicallymanipulating the ESR energies and thus the charge-transfer process thatcauses this resonation in the molecule. The concept, as it relates to molecu-lar electron spin resonations, can be explained more simply in terms of avibrating string, where it was first discovered as the principle of overtonalharmonics. Suppose an open string A is sounded on the cello; the stringsounds not only the fundamental but also a series of higher notes that areintegral multiples, as defined by the speed of vibration of the fundamentalone, the most important being an octave, a fifth, and a fourth apart. If thevibrating string is then touched very lightly, the fundamental note will becanceled and will sympathetically cancel the subsidiary harmonies above it,to the degree that they are harmonically close to the fundamental note.Our reasoning regarding the ESR of tryptamines was based on a similaridea. The psilocybin complex, the methylated tryptamines, and the har-mine complex are all biosynthetically derived in nature from tryptophanthrough a progressive cyclizing of the side-chain (cf. fig. 14). It seemedreasonable, therefore, to assume that this biosynthetic relationship isfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (121 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmfigure 14 Structures of Hallucinogens Related to TryptophanPsilocin, the dephosphorylated derivative of psilocybin, is shown here in its relation to tryptamine. Note that N, N-dimethyltryptamine isclosely related to psilocin. That tryptophan is a precursor of psilocybin in living organisms has been shown by Brack et al. (1961). Psilocybinand trace amounts of psilocin have been extracted from Stropharia cubensisby Hofmann et al.reflected in their ESR as well, and that their absorption frequencies wouldbe harmonic overtones of each other. If the ESR modulation of the tryp-file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (122 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmtamines can be heard by ingesting the mushroom, and if this modulationcan be amplified with sound, it will be absorbed at a higher frequency bythe harmine complexes if these are also being metabolized within the sys-tem. This should cancel the charge transfer of the metabolizing harmine,causing it to momentarily lose its electrical resistance and behave as a su-perconductor. Similarly, if the modulated harmine ESR is amplified withvocal harmonics, it should be absorbed at the tryptamine frequencies andcancel the tryptamine charge transfer.The motif and usage of ayahuasca in aboriginal shamanism correlateswell with the premise that harmine-type compounds afford access to gen-etically grounded, archetypal information. The configuration of the har-mine structure is ideally suited to act as a DNA intercalator. We have longspeculated that the action of such compounds is due to a kind of geneticreadout of molecularly coded information, which results from the harmineintercalating into the genetic material of the cerebral neurons. What hasheretofore eluded explanation is the precise mechanism by which thebonding between the harmine alkaloids and the DNA-RNA matrix cantake place and how, once this bond has been effected, the genetic readoutcan be detected by the higher cortical perceptions in the form of a psychicexperience. If our theory concerning the induction of superconductingconfiguration within these molecules via ESR harmonics was found to becorrect, this problem would be very nearly solved, for a molecule possess-ing zero electrical resistance would be able to sustain strong charge transferwith other superconducting molecules indefinitely. The harmine becomessuperconductive only for a microsecond but then is sustained in its super-conductivity through the fact of its having entered a bond state with thesuperconducting core of DNA. We speculate that superconductivity playsa role in the mechanism preserving the genetic message from disruption.That DNA might utilize superconductivity, or something similar, is an oldidea, but it has never been demonstrated (cf. Little 1965). We suggest thismay be because it is a quality of in vivo material, and that it is a systemsproperty that vanishes when the genetic material is disrupted. In What IsLife? (1944), Schrodinger, anticipating the discovery of DNA, wrote:... to reconcile the high durability of the hereditary substancewith its minute size, we had to evade the tendency to disorder byinventing the molecule, in fact, an unusually large moleculewhich has to be a masterpiece of highly differentiated order,file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (123 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmsafeguarded by the conjuring rod of quantum theory. The laws ofchance are not invalidated by this invention, but their outcomeis modified. The physicist is familiar with the fact that the classicallaws of physics are modified by quantum theory, especially at lowtemperature. There are many instances of this. Life seems to beone of them, a particularly striking one. Life seems to be orderlyand lawful behavior of matter, not based exclusively on its ten-dency to go over from order to disorder, but based partly on exist-ing order that is kept up.To the physicist—but only to him—I could hope to make myview clearer by saying: The living organism seems to be a macro-scopic system which in part of its behavior approaches to thatpurely mechanical (as contrasted with thermodynamical) conductto which all systems tend, as the temperature approaches to theabsolute zero and the molecular disorder is removed. (p. 69)We speculated that information stored in the neural-genetic materialmight be made available to consciousness through a modulated ESR ab-sorption phenomenon, originating in superconducting charge-transfercomplexes formed by intercalation of tryptamines and beta-carbolinesinto the genetic material. We reasoned that both neural DNA and neuralRNA were involved in this process: Serotonin or, in the case of our exper-iment, exogenously introduced methylated tryptamines would preferen-tially bind to membrane RNA, opening the ionic shutter mechanism and,simultaneously, entering into superconductive charge transfer with its re-sulting modulated ESR signal; beta-carbolines could then pass throughthe membrane via the RNA-ionic channel and intercalate into the neuralDNA. The DNA-harmine complex would possess an ESR modulated atfrequencies that were harmonic overtones of the ESR absorption frequen-cies of the RNA-tryptamine complex. The frequencies of either complexcould then be harmonically amplified or canceled by modulation of theother complex.To check our theories, we devised an experiment that was planned totrigger an intercalation of harmine into the genetic material that wouldsustain and stabilize its charge-transfer energy within a superconductingmatrix. We reasoned that an infusion of ayahuasca plus tryptamine (mush-room) admixtures would allow us to do the following: (1) We would hearand vocally imitate the ESR modulation of the tryptamines as they inter-calated with their RNA receptors. (2) The amplified tryptamine-RNAfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (124 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmESR would be a harmonic overtone of the harmine-DNA resonationfrequency, and the vocal modulation of these frequencies would cancel thetwo waveforms, causing both complexes to simultaneously lose theirelectrical resistance and assume superconducting configuration. (3) Theelectrically canceled harmine compound, which had been locked intosuperconductive bond with the DNA, would then begin to broadcast itswaveform hologramatic ESR configuration through the superconductingharmine-transducing circuit. This superconductively sustained and ampli-fied resonation of the harmine-DNA macromolecule would excite thetryptamine-RNA complex into a sympathetic resonance frequency, caus-ing it to act as a radio transmitter, which would broadcast the coded infor-mation of the harmine-DNA superconducting sustainer circuit.The modulated and superconductively sustained ESR of this macro-molecule might eventually manifest itself as a standing waveform thatwould, in effect, be a waveform hologram of the entire resonating macro-molecule. Such a molecule would be a superconductive holographic infor-mation storage system, containing all genetically and experientially codedinformation within its waveform pattern. It would respond to thought,which would be an interference pattern set up by resonating tryptamine-RNA complexes. Where the ESR set up in the cerebral tryptamine-RNAcomplex was in phase shift with the harmine-DNA matrix, a standingwaveform would be created in three-dimensional space, which would be ahologram of an idea. Conceiving an idea would create a specific waveformpattern of tryptamine-RNA resonation; where this resonated sympathet-ically on the superconducting DNA-harmine macromolecule, that partof the molecular chain would be beheld holographically as a three-dimensional image. What is described can be considered a solid-statecybernetic circuit, macromolecular in size and sustained by superconduc-tive charge transfer. As any other solid-state circuit, the material matrixwould be static, and the kinetic electrical activity would be the mobileelement. The components of such a system would have a fourfold arrange-ment. The superconductive harmine-DNA complex would function as acharge-transfer power source and holographic ESR readout mechanismfor informational gestalten stored in the in vivo DNA. The superconduct-ing tryptamine-RNA complex would function as a mentally triggeredswitch, governing the activation of the genetic readout mechanism andmonitoring the input of modulated ESR frequencies from the environ-ment. The total system would be a holo-cybernetic unit of superconduc-tive genetic material in which the entirety of the DNA memory bankfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (125 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmwould be at the command of the harmine readout mechanism, activatedvia tryptamine harmonic interference. The tryptamine-RNA complex,besides activating the DNA-harmine readout mechanism, could functionas an omnidirectional receiver for externally modulated ESR frequencies.If we imagine the harmine-DNA complex as a radio-cybernetic matrix,then we can suppose that this matrix stores information in a regressing hi-erarchy of interiorized reflections of itself, in a form similar to the familiarChinese ivory balls carved one within another, each level free to rotateindependently. In response to the vibration of tryptamine-RNA charge-transfer exchanges, modulated by mind into a usable signal, informationsearches of any sort might be conducted through a process that we suggestmight be much like the principle of retrieval of information from volumeholograms. Such a process of information retrieval and image projectionwould never lag behind human thought. Indeed, conscious thought maybe precisely this process, but occurring on a more limited scale. This limi-tation of scale may arise out of the way in which serotonin (5HT) reflectsthe ESR of the genetic material into which this neurotransmitter is con-tinually intercalating during normal metabolism. What we are suggestingon one level is that how conscious an organism is of the world that sur-rounds it may be fundamentally related to the charge-transfer capacity ofthe endogenous DNA and RNA intercalators that the organism hasevolved. Serotonin may be one of many possible resonant transmitters ofthe informational hologram that is stored in DNA. Harmine, we suggest,may be another, and perhaps more efficient, transmitter. Harmine may bemore efficient precisely because it bonds more readily to DNA than toRNA. The rise in levels of beta-carbolines seen in pineal glands as one as-cends the primate phylogeny—with the highest levels occurring in Homosapiens—lends credence to the idea that the adaptation called conscious-ness may involve mutation of the metabolic pathways associated withserotonin, other tryptamines, and harmine. The shift of emphasis fromserotonin pathways to beta-carboline and methylated tryptamine path-ways is, we speculate, the molecular evolutionary event that is responsiblefor the intimations of transfiguration that have recently characterizedmass consciousness.It is easy to see that the actualization of a functioning system of thetype described, when coupled with a controlling intellect, would be, in ef-fect, a hyperdimensionally mobile cybernetic entity. It would be the prac-tical equivalent of a transdimensional vehicle in that it would, in commonwith holographic imagery, actualize the Hermetic axiom that What isfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (126 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmhere is everywhere, what is not here is nowhere. It would be comparableto a flying saucer that moved through time and space, not in any conven-tional sense but rather one that is all time and space, warped through ahigher topology into the boundaries of conventional space-time. This issimilar to Jung's understanding of the psyche and is the effect that thisholo-cybernetic matrix would tend to create. If, in fact, neural DNA is therepository of information, as we postulate, then the system describedwould render the totality of this information available to consciousnessand might include all personal memories and experiences and also all col-lective knowledge and experience, accumulated over the evolutionary(and possibly cultural) history of the species and reflected in its geneticmakeup. Such a system would contain thousands of times the capabilitiesof enormous cybernetic systems in the space of a superconducting sus-tainer matrix only a few microns in diameter.Success in the formation of a permanent DNA-harmine bond and theresulting permanently sustained charge-transfer process could be expectedto trigger a metabolic and experiential situation with similarities to bothtoxic psychosis caused by abnormal tryptophan metabolism and the sha-manic trance attendant upon prolonged ingestion of ayahuasca (B. caapi)and ayahuasca admixtures. In each of these situations, experimental tryp-tophan psychosis and shamanic trance, what is involved are alterationsand inhibitions of normal amine levels in the brain. The shaman manipu-lates this bizarre region for culturally valid reasons and with techniques ofproven efficacy. The schizophrenic is an unwilling victim, a travelerthrough what to him is a terrifying landscape. Using analytical premisesand the operational constructs described above, we sought to carry our-selves, as modern humans, into the same numinous landscape and to offera report of interest to empirical investigators.Chapter 7Psychological Reflections on La ChorreraWith chapter 6 as a basis, we approach the most difficult aspect of the LaChorrera experiment that we are called upon to discuss, the subjectivepsychological contents. Here is an area where we must exercise objectivityfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (127 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmin discussing personal situations. Because we experienced what is de-scribed in this chapter, we are acutely aware of its strangeness and its in-credibility. But psychology is a young science, and the neat separation ofexperiment and experimenter, which characterizes the physical sciences,will become an impediment to the progress of experimental psychology iftaken too seriously. We would feel that we were not being completelyhonest and thus not as scientific as possible if we did not share with thereader the nature of the situation in which these ideas were generated.Memory will necessarily play a major part in any account of a process hav-ing temporal duration, but what a reconstructed memory fails to correctlyrepresent is the formation of understanding as a gradual reaching out orgroping that is, itself, a process proceeding through time. The experimentcaused a release of unconscious imagery related to several themes of an ar-chetypal nature. The major theme was that of transformation.Silverman (cf. above, Part One, chapter 2) has noted two types of schiz-ophrenia under the heading of reactive, which he calls essential andparanoid. His descriptions of the symptoms of these two types corre-spond well to the varieties of unusual ideation we experienced as themajor confirmation of our success on the submolecular level in the twoweeks following the experiment of March 5,1971. From that date, the nor-mal configurations of both our personalities started a sudden and imme-diate migration toward these two forms of reactive schizophrenia. In theearly morning hours of March 5, shortly after the completion of the vocalexperiment outlined in chapter 6, in the space of scarcely more than anhour, one of us entered a progressively more detached state of essentialschizophrenia or classic shamanic trance.We could feel the presence of some invisible hyperspatial entity, an ally,which seemed to be observing and sometimes exerting influence on the sit-uation to keep us moving gently toward an experimental resolution of theideas we were generating. Because of the alien nature of the tryptaminetrance, its seeming accentuation of themes alien, insectile, and futuristic,and because of previous experiences with tryptamine in which insectilehallucinatory transformations of human beings were observed, we were ledto speculate that the role of the presence was somehow like that of an an-thropologist, come to give humanity the keys to galactarian citizenship.We discussed this entity in terms of a giant insect and, through the insecttrill of the Amazon jungle at midday, seemed able to discern a deeper har-file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (128 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmmonic buzz that somehow signified the unseen outsider. This sense of thepresence of an alien third entity was sometimes very intense, most intensein early March and from there fading off gradually.For the next thirty-seven days, especially the next fourteen days, ourshared ideation consisted of, among other themes, but as a dominant one,the idea of a shamanic journey of return from the ends of space and timeto the earth, with the collected energy configuration of space-time con-densed into a kind of lens or saucer, a true philosopher's stone. One of usexperienced an intense transference state similar to reactive paranoidschizophrenia and accepted the paternal and curative role of shaman andpsychopomp. From the sixth until the seventeenth of March, one of usdid not sleep, and the other, while awake, spoke continuously, in appar-ent and convincing telepathic rapport with anyone he wished, in com-mand of enormous technical erudition and a strange and rapidly evolvinghyperspatial cosmogony that, following a Manichean perception, visual-ized the solar system as a huge light pump, wherein the light of souls ispumped from planet to planet until it finally leaves the solar system alto-gether and is transmitted to the galactic center.* Some of his discoveries were that Jupiter is the reflected image of the earth in hyperspace, is teem-ing with bizarre life-forms, and is somehow an essential key to unravelingthe species' fate. In his interior epic, late twentieth-century history wasexperienced as a frantic effort to build an object, which he called thelens, to allow life to escape to Jupiter on the heels of an impendingglobal catastrophe.Slowly, as the shamanic voyager neared his home, his place in space, hisstitch in time, the myth making and the symptoms of election schizophre-nia faded in each of us. However, the continuing process of understand-ing, triggered by the experiment, did not cease. Rather, it continued tostabilize and define itself with the passage of each twenty-four-hour cycle,leading out of the crazy poetic ideation of the early days following theexperiment and into the understanding that has led us to hypothesize anew model of mind and time. Our model is, first, an effort to trace thelogic of these experiences in terms relevant to the molecular levels where[* For further discussion of the archetypal theme of return to the galactic center, the interested reader isreferred to Hamlet's Mill (de Santillana and von Dechend 1969), especially chapter 18.]the experimental superconductive intercalation of harmine may havefile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (129 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmtaken place. The content of our experience has resolved itself into the log-ical consequences that flow from the revealed axiom that all phenomenaare at root constellated by a waveform that is the hierarchical summationof its constituent parts, morphogenetic patterns related to those in DNA.Although we can clearly recognize that our experience evinces the clas-sic symptomatology associated with the two generally distinguished cate-gories of process schizophrenia, we are unable to make the assumptionthat the experiment was therefore nothing but a simultaneous schizo-phrenia (cf. chapter 2). Rather, we maintain that we are, in fact, dealingwith an objective phenomenon that, although of a highly peculiar nature,inexorably bound up with psychic processes, does have its basis in themolecular phenomena we were in the process of investigating. As empiri-cal evidence for this view, we mention the following points that seem todeviate from the usual schizophrenic episode: (1) The suddenness withwhich the symptoms developed following our actual experiment; that isto say, within a few minutes after we completed our preplanned experi-mental procedures, we began to disengage from the continuum of collec-tive perception and, at the same time, began to experience the expandedchannel capacity that we had predicted would be a part of the phenome-nology to be manifested if we were successful in our attempt to generate asuperconducting genetic matrix harmine bond. (2) The simultaneous anddovetail aspect of our disassociation, meaning that, although both of uswere exhibiting the symptoms of a type of schizophrenia, the ideas andthe understanding that we were experiencing was shared. In the same waythat a film running in reverse seems to present a spectacle of wild and irra-tional confusion, yet manages in the end to have things in their properplaces, mentation and physical movement seemed to be simply the reverseof logical expectations. (3) One of us experienced eleven days withoutsleep and felt no strain during this same period.More important than any of these factors (which are, after all, unique,unverified, and unrepeatable events) indicating a condition beyond sim-ple schizophrenia are the idea models we have created out of the carefulobservation of the things that happened to us. It is upon this theory, andnot as reporters of paranormal events, that we wish to be judged.We argue that the theory of the hyperspatial nature of superconductivebonds, and the experiment we devised to test that theory, yielded not onlyspectacular subjective results but also a modular wave-hierarchy theory ofthe nature of time that we have been able to construe, using a particularmathematical treatment of the / Ching, into a general theory of systems,file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (130 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmwhich illuminates the nature of time and organism and provides an ideamodel that explains the interconnection of physical and psychologicalphenomena from the submolecular to the macrocosmic level.We cannot close these psychological reflections on our experimentwithout a brief discussion of the nature of the subjective experience of thehallucinogenic tryptamines that were our basic tools. To ingest Strophariacubensis is to erect a star antenna ; that is, by taking psychodynamictryptamines into one's system, one is better able to hear and perhaps tosee the standing wave of species' experience (as seems to be possible insome dreams). The character of the mushroom experience is almost en-tirely that of understanding.* We suggest that this understanding may bethe amplified appearance, at the level of a higher cortical experience, ofthe DNA electron spin resonance. The Stropharia mushroom is an evi-dently nontoxic and easily applied tool for intensifying the phenomenonassociated with gaining access to the atemporal unconscious. This case forutilization is like much else about the mushroom that partakes of theSiren's Song. In using the mushroom, one must be especially alert fortransference phenomena and ego identification with the contents of thehyperactive imagination. It is not we who are doing anything; the self-revelation of the phenomenon is something that is happening to us. Alter-ation of monoamine oxidase (MAO) levels through the smoking of B.caapi bark after ingesting mushrooms is the closest approximation tosmoking synthetic tryptamine (DMT) that we have found in nature. It isquite possible that in the resin of Virola theiodora there are even more pro-foundly active tryptamine and beta-carboline compounds. If some oddform of toxicity within the mushroom had a role in our experiences, itwas not apparent in subsequent mushroom experiences.It is possible that the schizophrenic episode which followed our experi-ment may have resulted from an irreversible inhibition of MAO. SomeMAO inhibitors used therapeutically as antidepressants (notably iproni-azid) can bind irreversibly to the enzyme, triggering a long-term inhibitionthat can only be mitigated through the production of new enzymes byprotein synthesis. Studies of irreversible inhibition have shown that full re-covery of normal MAO activity can require a period of ten to twenty days(Planz et al. 1972). While harmine and its analogs are known to exhibitstrong MAO inhibition, this action is reversible and is on the order ofthree to six hours (Undenfriend et al. 1958). If, however, we succeeded infile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (131 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htm[* In Whitehead's phrase, this understanding is, however imperfect, the self-evidence of pattern so faras it has been discriminated (1968, p. 52). In the same work (p. 50), Whitehead states, Understandingis self-evidence . . . Proofs are the tools for the extension of our imperfect self-evidence. ]creating a superconducting configuration in harmine and its analogs, thenwe should expect that they would irreversibly bind to MAO as well as toneural DNA, and thus may have produced the symptoms that followedour experiment. MAO inhibition is reflected by a rise in 5HT levels in thebrain, since synthesis continues at a normal rate, while turnover of theamine is inhibited (Planz et al. 1972.). If exogenously introduced trypta-mines are present in the system, these will also accumulate in the absenceof MAO activity. Perhaps, in our experiment, the introduction of re-versible MAO inhibitors plus tryptamines into the nervous system causedan initial accumulation of serotonin and methylated tryptamines. Subse-quently, these methylated tryptamines and possibly the 5HT, having theirusual conversion pathways blocked by MAO inhibition, became substratesfor other enzymes such as N-methyl transferase and hydroxy-indoleO-methyl transferase (HIOMT). These enzymes could further increasethe levels of methylated tryptamines. Some of these amines may have beenconverted via the alternative enzyme pathways to psychotomimetic com-pounds not amenable to MAO inactivation, which might continue to ac-cumulate in the system even after normal MAO activity had been restored.If our own theory is incorrect or incomplete, this may explain how wewere able to maintain a continuous connection with the unconscious overmany months.At first we approached the psychedelic phenomenology of the Stropha-ria mushroom with perfect innocence. Now understanding has placed usforever beyond such unawareness. In comparison with synthetic psyche-delics, the physical effects of S. cubensis compare with those of mescaline.One must be particularly sensitive to incidents that might be precursorsto some sort of uncontrollable outbreak of unconscious contents. Ourtheory seems to indicate that, for all its concern, the ego really is not ableto control the flow of events at all. If this is true and if a trance episode isa constituent part of this phenomenon, then there is nothing to be doneto mitigate its inevitability. This is not, however, to be construed as a li-cense for recklessness; on the contrary, one should act as though causalityis operable and the ego in control. The mushroom is a tool that allows aninsight into the state of the standing wave of mind on unconscious levels,but it is not necessary for the continuation of that phenomenon.

Our mushroom experiences allowed us to remember andreconnect with deeper states of tryptamine ecstasy, to reconstruct and tofeel the poetic-literary idea complex that was, in fact, one motivation forour program of investigation of natural tryptamines.We refer to the dynamic yet stable, apparently self-sustaining, non-three-dimensional spatiality into which the smoking of tryptamines con-veys one. We especially refer to the apparently autonomous and intelligent,chaotically mercurial and mischievous machine elves encountered in thetrance state, strange teachers whose marvelous singing makes intricate toysout of the air and out of their own continually transforming body geome-tries. This spectacle of more than Oriental splendor is the characteristic,even unvarying, manner in which this experience presents itself. A sound,which finally can be seen as a topology, dynamically contorts itself into aform, whose voice the sound then becomes, and which it then uses to pro-duce idea complexes presented with the specific purpose of teaching some-thing. But this something is not easily brought back from that dimension,and this fact sets up a dynamic polarity between the ego and the content ofthe ecstasy. That polarity is the compass of our quest. That place or state isthe area inviting exploration. In some very real sense, it is the place whereideas come from. In that other dimension, vast evolving idea complexespass before one and are understood in an instant. And through the singingelf machines, many such object/ideas clamor (literally) for one's attentionat once. In the words of H. Munn, writing of mushroom use in Oxaca,... the impish mushrooms come to life, embodiments of merriment,tumbling figments of the spontaneous, performing incredible acrobaticfeats (in Harner 1973, p. no).The content of the experience has an emotional richness that is pro-foundly deep, yet so positive that one must laugh aloud. Inevitably, thesubjective richness, and the apparent self-coherence of the content of thetryptamine trance, leads those who experience it to wonder after its impli-cations for modern humans. The idea of the simultaneous coexistence ofan alien dimension all around us is as strange an idea in the context ofmodern society as it must have been to the first shamans, whose experi-ments with psychoactive plants would have soon brought them to thesame tryptamine doorway. What is the nature of the invisible landscapebeyond that doorway? The answer to the question is linked to the ques-tion of the nature of mind. If the world beyond the doorway can be givenfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (133 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmconsensual validation of the sort extended to the electron and the blackhole—in other words, if the world beyond the doorway is found to be anecessary part of scientifically mature thinking about the world—thenour own circumscribed historical struggle will be subject to whole newworlds of possibility.If poetics color the science of our way, these trances are their founda-tions. Is this idea completely outside the realm of philosophical experience?Jonas (1966), in discussing an allegory in Philo Judaeus, which evolvesfrom the etymology of the word Israel, he who sees God, says:A more perfect archetypal logos, exempt from the human dualityof sign and thing, and therefore not bound by the forms ofspeech, would not require the mediation of hearing, but is imme-diately beheld by the mind as the truth of things. In other wordsthe antithesis of seeing and hearing argued by Philo lies as a wholewithin the realm of seeing —that is to say, it is no real antithesisbut a difference of degree relative to the ideal of immediate intu-itive presence of the object. It is with a view to this ideal that thehearing here opposed to seeing is conceived, namely, as itsdeputizing, provisional mode, and not as something authentic,basically other than seeing. Accordingly, the turn from hearing toseeing here envisaged is merely a progress from a limited knowl-edge to an adequate knowledge of the same and within the sameproject of knowledge. (p. 238)This is an excellent description of the interiorized linguistic phenome-non that proceeds and differs only in degree from the visual phenomenon,which seems, indeed, a more perfect archetypal logos and which, in ourexperience, defines the tryptamine trance experience. If the physical brainis analogous to a holographic plate, can sounds in certain ranges penetratethe skull in such a way as to make audile holograms (visual images) appearin 3D space or in the mind-brain of another organism? This matter standscompletely unresearched, although audilely induced wave interferencepatterns have been illuminated with lasers to produce hologramatic im-ages (cf. chapter 4).We are not alone in suggesting that the tryptamine compounds aresomehow vitally involved with the mysteries of language and language for-mation:file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (134 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmThe Mazatecs say that the mushrooms speak. If you ask a shamanwhere his imagery comes from, he is likely to reply: I didn't sayit, the mushrooms did. No mushroom speaks, that is a primitiveanthropomorphization of the natural, only man speaks, but hewho eats these mushrooms, if he is a man of language, becomesendowed with an inspired capacity to speak. The shamans who eatthem, their function is to speak, they are the speakers who chantand sing the truth, they are the oral poets of their people, the doc-tors of the word, they who tell what is wrong and how to remedyit, the seers and oracles, the ones possessed by the voice. It is notI who speak, said Heraclitus, it is the logos. Language is anecstatic activity of signification. Intoxicated by the mushrooms,the fluency, the ease, the aptness of expression one becomes capa-ble of are such that one is astounded by the words that issue forthfrom the contact of the intention of articulation with the matterof experience. At times it is as if one were being told what to say,for the words leap to mind, one after another, of themselves with-out having to be searched for: a phenomenon similar to the auto-matic dictation of the surrealists except that here the flow ofconsciousness, rather than being disconnected, tends to be coher-ent: a rational enunciation of meanings. Message fields of commu-nication with the world, others and one's self are disclosed by themushrooms. The spontaneity they liberate is not only perceptual,but linguistic, the spontaneity of speech, of fervent, lucid dis-course, of the logos in activity. For the shaman, it is as if existencewere uttering itself through him . . . words are materializations ofconsciousness; language is a privileged vehicle of our relation toreality. (Munn, in Harner 1973, pp. 88-89)Summation of our Amazon experience is not easy. In the wake of ourexperiment there have been, besides enormous disruptions of statisticalnorms in the form of accumulations of meaningful coincidences, in-stances of physical phenomena absolutely beyond current understanding.Telepathic phenomena, especially, in our subjective judgment, were mani-fest several times during this period. These experiences go an enormousdistance toward convincing us that we are indeed involved with a paranor-mal phenomenon that may violate the usual laws of conventional physics.These experiences have been the continuing motivation for our attemptto empirically demonstrate the existence of this phenomenon.

It is this continuing self-explication on the part of the phenomenon and the resolution of theexplication into a general theory of systems or process that sets our exper-ience apart from the general gnosis of shamanism or schizophrenia. Be-cause this theory makes assertions about reality, it invites careful empiricalinvestigation. It is for this reason that, while cultivating a suspended judg-ment, we endeavor to allow the phenomenon every opportunity to revealand refine itself.Part TwoTime,Change,andBecomingIntroductionIn Part Two we will be concerned with some of the speculations arisingout of the apparent functioning of the audilely induced intercalation ofharmine into the genetic matrix. These speculations have arisen in themonths, and now years, that have followed upon our original experiment.These extrapersonal thought processes arose in a temporal sequence ofsteady self-amplification and explication; internal contradictions havebeen few.The chapters that follow require what may appear at first as a sharpshift of focus. The discussion now moves from the methodological andphilosophical bases of our experiment to a rather formal exposition of thecalendrical potentials offered by the structure of the sequence of the hexa-file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (136 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmgrams used in the classic Chinese divinatory system, the I Ching. Thisconcern may appear to be far removed from the molecular basis of Ama-zonian shamanic trance, but in fact divination is the especial prerogativeof the shaman, whatever the cultural context. It is one of the major signsof a shaman's command of a superhuman condition. The three-thousand-year-old King Wen sequence of the sixty-four hexagrams of the / Ching isamong the oldest structured abstractions extant, yet the nature of the or-dering principles preserved in that sequence remains unelucidated. The IChing is a mathematical divinatory tool of great age whose probable ori-gin is the mountainous heart of Asia—the home of classical shamanismand Taoist magic—it is a centrally important part of humanity's shamanicheritage that is rich in implications. Chapter 8 traces some of the impli-cations the / Ching may have had for neolithic China and its intuitionsconcerning time. We chose to examine the / Ching and its relation totemporality and organism because, in the months following our experi-ment, their specific similarities seemed to force themselves upon us. It isour supposition that the unconscious contents which our experimentmade accessible were constellated around the / Ching because it is particu-larly concerned with the dynamic relationships and transformations thatarchetypes undergo; it is deeply involved with the nature of time as thenecessary condition for the manifestation of archetypes as categories of ex-perience. The / Ching, through its concern with detailing the dynamics ofchange and process, may hold the key to modeling the temporal dimen-sion that metabolism creates for organisms, the temporal dimension with-out which mind could not manifest.Our tentative assumption is that the intense involvement we experi-enced with this problem arose out of the functioning of the harmine-DNAcomplex and the intensified broadcast of the structurally modulated ESRof that unusual molecular configuration. Chapter 9 examines the hypoth-esized resonance calendar of the previous chapter from a point of viewthat seeks to isolate the irreducible elements in such a hierarchical view oftime and then to treat them as the system by which organisms order theirworld-describing cognitive categories. The later chapters of Part Two willelevate the temporal variables contained in the / Ching calendar to thelevel of a possible general law of nature descriptive of temporal variables inmacrophysical as well as quantum-mechanical systems. In chapter 10 wediscuss the nature of the order of the King Wen sequence and then pre-sent techniques for graphically mapping the proposed temporal contin-uum. Chapter 10 carries the mapping process to a new level of refinementfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (137 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmby presenting techniques for a comparative numerical quantification ofevery point in the hierarchy relative to a zero state. The cosmology such ageneral law of nature would make necessary is examined in chapter II,which deals with the part of astrophysics relevant to the cosmic view ofthe atemporal shaman. Chapter 12 discusses the teleology a temporal hier-archy implies. In chapter 13 we discuss quantification of the hierarchy andthe opportunities it offers for attempts to experimentally test its empiricalexistence. A systems approach to charting the parameters of the historicalfuture is also outlined. Chapter 14 discusses evolution and freedom in thelight of the above.Chapter 8The / Ching as Lunar Calendar andAstronomical CalculatorThe / Ching is an oracle system of great age in wide use in China sincearound 1000 B.C. It consists of sixty-four hexagrams, or six-line figures.Lines in a hexagram may be solid (—) or broken (- -), and a hexagram isread from bottom to top. The resulting sixty-four permutations uponthese simple rules (figs. 15 and 16) were believed by the Chinese to reflectuniversal categories, or archetypes, that could shed light on one's fate if oneproperly consulted the oracle. The method of consulting the oracle haschanged over the centuries. Originally bones were used; later forty-ninestalks of yarrow; still later coins were tossed. None of this will concern ushere. Neither will we be concerned with the voluminous commentaries,doctrines, and interpretations of the / Ching that began in the early Handynasty and continue today. These matters are discussed thoroughly inWilhelm (1964) and Needham (1954,1965).Our concern will be with facts that predate history, and with which nocommentary can claim to be contemporary. We will be concerned withthe primary unit of the / Ching, the hexagram. We will examine in detailits three-leveled hierarchical structure. The King Wen sequence, the oldestpreserved human abstract sequence, will occupy us in later chapters as weseek for its ordering principles, make assumptions, and advance hypothe-ses. In this chapter, we will lay the groundwork for these more theoreticaldiscussions by detailing what we believe neolithic China was doing withthe / Ching, and hence why it was structured as it is.file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (138 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmThough the origins of the / Ching are uncertain, Joseph Needham(1954) adopts the position of Li Ching-Chhih that . . . the canonical textoriginated from omen compilations which might be as old as the 7th or8th century [b.c], though it did not reach its present form before the endof the Chou Dynasty (p. 307). Needham goes on to say: The first exten-sion of the system of the kua (hexagrams) seems to have taken place dur-ing the early Han period, when they were brought into systematicassociation with sidereal movements and hence with the passage of time (1954, p. 329). In a footnote to the above we find: Alternatively W. Eber-hard suggests . . . that the / Ching hexagrams were connected with somepre-Chhin calendar system (Needham 1954, p. 329n).file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (139 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htm file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (140 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmFIGURE 15The King Wen arrangement of the sixty-four / Ching hexagrams.This chapter will suggest in a speculative way a possible form that thislost calendar may have had. Since we are not sinologists, the case will bemade around a single objective fact. We will extrapolate this fact throughthe use of only two assumptions concerning ancient Chinese culture andpsychology. These assumptions are widely enough held among commen-tators on Oriental culture that they may be regarded as secure statementsof a broad consensus. Of central interest is the coincidence of the durationof thirteen lunations and the number 384. The true value for the durationof a lunation is 29.530588 days. Examination of oracle bones dated to thefile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (141 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmthirteenth century B.C. has, according to Needham, led to the conclusionthat at that time the length of the lunation was known to be 29.53 days.29.53 days X 13 = 383.89 daysThe nearness of this number to 384 is made significant when one realizesthat 384 is the number that arises when sixty-four is multiplied by six, sixbeing the number of yao or lines in a single hexagram. This last sentence in-troduces one of the assumptions by which we will advance the argument. Itis the assumption of hierarchical or resonance thinking in Chinese intellec-tual constructs. In this case, it is the notion that what is done with the yao,the most basic element of a hexagram (multiplication by six to form a hexa-gram), might also be done with the entire set of yao, the complete sequenceof sixty-four hexagrams. This idea that operations carried out on one levelare elegant and efficacious if carried out in a similar way on other levels isintimately related to our second premise. This is the idea of cyclical recur-rence of events and situations on many different scales of duration. The im-portance of these ideas in ancient China has been widely noted. An exampleof each will suffice. First, resonance thinking:Much has already been said about the importance in the Chineseworldview of action at a distance, in which the different kinds ofthings in the universe resonate with one another. In the 5th cen-tury A.D. Shih Shuo Hsin Yu we find the following:Mr. Yin, a native of Chinchow, once asked a (Taoist) monk,Chang Yeh-Yuan, 'What is really the fundamental idea (thi) of theBook of Changes (I Ching)?'The latter answered, 'The fundamental idea of the / Ching canbe expressed in one single word, Resonance (Kan).'Mr. Yin then said, 'We are told that when the Copper Moun-tain (Thung Shan) collapsed in the west, the bell Ling Chungresponded (ying), by resonance, in the east. Would this be accord-ing to the principles of the / Ching?'Chang Yeh-Yuan laughed and gave no answer to this ques-tion. (Needham 1954, p. 304)file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (142 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmOn cycles:. . . Nothing could be more striking than the appreciation of cycli-cal change, the cycle-mindedness, of the Taoists. Returning is thecharacteristic movement of the Tao (the Order of Nature) saysthe Tao Te Ching. Time's typical virtue, wrote Granet, is toproceed by revolution. Indeed time (shih) is itself generated,some thought, by this uncreated and spontaneous (tzu-jan) never-ceasing circulation (yun). (Needham 1965, p. 6)It is established, therefore, that striking correlations exist between acount of 6 X 64 days and lunar motion. The 384-day year is a lunar yearof thirteen lunar months. Such a lunar year has been determined to be383.9 days or .1 day less than 384 days. Therefore, the cycle loses 2.4 hours(.1 day) each 384 days. If one were to adopt 384-day-long years as a calen-dar and insert one intercalary day every ten of such years, making everytenth year 385 days long, this calendar would lose one day every 454.5 ofits years. Thus, the calendar would be accurate to .0022 day loss per 384-day year. This is accurate indeed as calendars go.That neolithic calendars in China were lunar is generally regarded asestablished. The two most likely year counts would necessarily be 384 days(13 lunations) or 354 days (12 lunations). Three hundred eighty-four, ifused as a day count, seems to have resonances with the durations of otherastronomical cycles of longer duration. To demonstrate these resonances,it is necessary to continue to apply the same principles of hierarchical ex-trapolation that link the sixty-four hexagrams to a duration of 384; that is,multiplication of subunits into larger modules via numbers inherent inthe structure of the / Ching: Six or sixty-four. We suggest that the 384-daylunar year discussed above was viewed by the calendar makers of earlyChina as a hexagram. This idea would have arisen as a natural conse-quence of observing the relationships between the six yao of a hexagramand the six small cycles of sixty-four days, each of which together formedthe 384-day year. At this point in the process, it is reasonable to supposethat the Chinese love of cycles, hierarchies, and resonances would have ledthem, having cognized the 384-day year as a hexagram, to assume that 64file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (143 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmtable 1 Permutations of I Ching HexagramsBase Multiplier Multiplicand AstronomicalUnit64 days (# of x 6 (# of yao in a 384 days 13 lunationshexagrams in hexagram)/ Ching)384 days X 64 (# of 67 solar years, 6 minor sunspothexagrams in a 104.25 days cycles (11.2 years)sequence)67 solar years, x 64 (# of 4306+ 2 Zodiacal Ages104.25 days hexagrams in a solar years (1 per trigram),sequence) 4400 yearsapprox.4306+ x 6 (# of yao in a 25,836 1 completesolar years hexagram) solar years procession ofthe equinoxes,26,000 yearsFIGURE 16Calendrical properties operating in the / Ching bear a relation to a lunar year ofthirteen lunations and to the equinoctial precession, as well as to sunspot cycles.X 384 days was a natural division of time. Once begun, the process needknow no end. And indeed, 384 X 64 X 64 also shows interesting resonanceperiods. In fact, several phenomena that have been found to be cyclicalappear to have relationships of correspondence to the calendrical hierar-chy on one of its levels. As an example, we may point out that the 67.35-year cycle (384 days X 64) is composed of six yao cycles of 11.225 years; thisis in astonishing agreement with the average sunspot cycle, whose dura-tion is given as 11.2 years. What is perhaps even more startling is that thecycle of sunspot frequency discloses a 33.33-year period along with its 11.2-year period. The 33.67-year duration of the trigrammatic cycle is withinone-third year of this duration. It is an established fact that sunspot cyclesproduce a periodicity in plant growth:file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (144 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmThe growth of trees is accelerated during sunspot maxima; thusthe eleven-year sunspot cycle is reflected in the increasing anddecreasing width of the annual rings of trees. This effect is so reli-able that archaeologists use it to date the establishment of ancientsettlements. (Knoll, in Campbell 1967, p. 291)Periodically, in mental hospital wards, aggressive patients showintense surges of activity . . . Such outbursts occur only sporadi-cally but are striking enough to have invited study. At DouglasHospital in Montreal, continuous, round-the-clock observationstudies of patients over periods of several months did, indeed,show a picture of such periodic outbursts. Correlations betweenincreased aggression and staff on duty, changes in menu, medica-tion, or visiting days were too weak to explain the group behavior. . . When no explanation could be found, Dr. Heinz Lehmanncompared his hospital data against data from the U.S. Space Dis-turbance Forecast Center in Boulder, Colorado. There appearedto be a correlation between solar flare activity (sun spots), geo-magnetic disturbances, and excitement on the ward . . . Sincesun flares are bursts of gaseous material, high energy particlesthat influence the ionosphere, causing changes in magnetic fieldson earth, a relationship is not impossible. Sun storms sometimescause a noticeable deflection in a compass needle. Perhaps, sincethe brain is at least as sensitive as a fine compass, it also respondsto large magnetic disturbances. (Luce 1971, p. 14)And sunspots were familiar to ancient Chinese:As Ionides and Ionides have said, Chinese astrological conclusionswere for once perhaps right in maintaining a connection betweencelestial and terrestrial phenomena. Though not at present gener-ally admitted, it is not impossible that the sun-spot period maybe connected, through meteorological effects, with events of socialimportance, such as good and bad harvests. Such a correlation isindeed maintained for Japanese rice crop famines since a.d. 1750by Arakawa. Conceivably the basis of the association made inthe Chi Ni Tzu book . . . between the 12-year Jupiter cycle andan agricultural production cycle, may really have been, as Chatleyfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (145 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmsuggests, the n-year sun-spot period. Correlations between theperiodicity of sun-spot maxima and other phenomena such asaurorea, using in part Chinese data, have been attempted by sev-eral workers. (Needham 1954, vol. 2, p. 436)One reason advanced for the use of a sexagenary cycle in the historicalChinese calendar is that it is perhaps five repetitions of the approximatelytwelve-year cycle of Jupiter (cf. above). Might it not be that five Jupitercycles equaling one sixty-year cycle and the solar year calendar of 360 dayswere a clumsy replacement for an early sixty-four-year cycle of 384-dayyears (67+ solar years) that also very accurately kept the sunspot cycle of11.2 solar years.The earliest Chinese dynasty whose calendar is known is the Chou. Ac-cording to W. Eberhard, a 384-day year did exist in late Chou times,although it was regarded as an intercalary year with the usual year oftwelve months being 354 days. Seven such intercalary years were insertedin every nineteen years, that is, into the Lunar Metonic cycle (W. Eber-hard, personal communication, 1974). This mixed calendar may repre-sent a transition form from an earlier time when years of 384 days wereused exclusively.In addition to the correlations to lunations and sunspot cycles cited,there is yet another cycle of celestial movement that appears to be builtinto the hierarchical / Ching calendar. This cycle is the zodiacal worldyear generated by the slow precession of the equinoxes.. . . the equinoctial points —and therefore, the solstitial ones,too—do not remain forever where they should in order to makecelestial goings-on easier to understand, namely, at the same spotwith respect to the sphere of the fixed stars. Instead, they stub-bornly move along the ecliptic in the opposite direction to theyearly course of the sun, that is, against the right sequence ofthe zodiacal signs . . . This phenomenon is called the Precessionof the Equinoxes, and it was conceived as causing the rise and thecataclysmic fall of ages of the world. Its cause is a bad habit ofthe axis of our globe, which turns around in the manner of aspinning top, its tip being in the center of our small earth-ball,whence our earth axis, prolonged to the celestial North Pole,describes a circle around the North Pole of the ecliptic, the truecenter of the planetary system, the radius of this circle being offile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (146 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmthe same magnitude as the obliquity of the ecliptic with respect tothe equator: 23 1/2*. The time which this prolonged axis needs tocircumscribe the ecliptical North Pole is roughly 26,000 years,during which period it points to one star after another: around3000 B.C. the Pole star was alpha Draconis; at the time of theGreeks it was beta Ursea Minoris; for the time being it is alphaUrsea Minoris; in a.d. 14,000 it will be Vega. The equinoxes, thepoints of intersection of ecliptic and equator, swinging fromthe spinning axis of the earth, move along with the same speed of26,000 years along the ecliptic. (de Santillana and von Dechend1969, pp. 58-59)Various mathematical treatments of the phenomenon of nutation (asmall periodic motion of the celestial pole with respect to the pole of theecliptic) introduce uncertainty into the duration of this year; de Santillanagives it as 25,920 years, while Flamerion shows it as 25,780. Both these fig-ures are in disagreement with the value contained in standard astronomicaltables, 25,725 years. We have already shown that 64 X 384 days gives a du-ration (67+ years), sixths and halves of which have relation to sunspots.When the 67+ year cycle is similarly treated (multiplied by 64), a durationof 4,302+ years is obtained. One-sixth of this number seems to have no sig-nificance astronomically; however, one-half of this number equals 2,153years. This number is very close to the 2,200-year length of a zodiacalyear —the number that results when the duration of the precession(25,700 years) is divided by the twelve zodiacal signs, giving zodiacal ages approximately 2,200 years in duration. The correlation is too close to beaccidental. It can only enhance our respect for the prehistoric astronomyof the Chinese, since it has long been assumed that no one could have de-tected the equinoctial precession before it was allegedly discovered by Hip-parchus in 127 B.C. It was natural that the Han astronomers should wish toincorporate into their astronomy the sidereal periods of planetary revolu-tion. Their thought was that at the beginning of a world cycle there hadbeen a general conjunction of the planets and that at the end of the worldthis would happen again. This notion of a general conjunction occurs inHellenistic literature and may derive from Berossus and the Babylonians.Discovery of calendrical properties operating in the / Ching that appearto bear a relation to a lunar year of thirteen cycles and to the zodiacalworld year, as well as to sunspot cycles, suggests a possible historical spec-file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (147 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmulation. The Chinese year has an average duration of 360 days. It is in es-sential agreement with the lunar Metonic year developed in fifth-centuryAthens. The thirteen-month lunar / Ching calendar is composed of 13 X29.53 days; 12 X 29.53 = 354.4 days, while a solar year is 365.25 days. Theaverage of these numbers is 359.85, or within .15 of an average Chineseyear. Richard Wilhelm (1964), in discussing the age of the / Ching and itsattribution to the legendary figure Fu Hsi, says: The fact that he (Fu Hsi)is designated as the inventor of the linear signs of the Book of Changesmeans that they have been held to be of such antiquity that they antedatehistorical memory (p. xxxviii). Other scholars agree:Eberhard believes that it is possible to trace several local calendarsin very ancient times and that it was this which gave rise to theidea that there had been official calendars of the Hsia, Shang andChou dynasties. Jao Tsung-I has described an interesting calen-drical diagram, with text, inscribed on silk and of Chhu Stateprovenance, dating from about the 4th century. Han calendarshave been studied by Shinjo and by Eberhard Henseling . . .(Needham 1954, vol. 2, p. 391)It is possible to suggest that in neolithic China the sequence of 64 hexa-grams X 6 was actually known and used as a calendar. This calendar wasvery early displaced by the more seasonally oriented, yet less astronomi-cally functional 360-day solar year calendar.One can only speculate how and why this may have happened. Perhapsthe astronomical rationale behind the 384-day calendar had degeneratedinto a secret knowledge, confined to a ruling or priestly class that cameinto conflict with a popular, rationalistic, antiesoteric faction that soughtthe elimination of the thirteenth lunar cycle in order to reform the calen-dar to more nearly conform with the solar year. W. Eberhard (personalcommunication, 1974) has pointed out that traditionally in China thenumber thirteen has not been highly regarded; it is a prime number andas such is not reducible to two (female) or three (male) or four or nine.For the traditional Chinese, twelve preserves harmony and thirteen dis-turbs it. This Chinese attitude may be a clue to the non-Chinese origin ofthe / Ching and the thirteen-month lunar cycle calendar possibly associ-ated with it. In Han times, the / Ching was called the Chou /and was as-sumed to have originated with that dynasty in the far northwest of China.file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (148 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmA calendar and astronomy being introduced from outside of China wouldnaturally encounter resistance.If this controversy became overt and violent, we can imagine the occur-rence of events similar to the book burning of 213 B.C., which may haveresulted in all but complete destruction of the thirteen-month lunar cal-endar and knowledge of its relation to the hexagram sequence. The super-stition that each new dynasty or reign period must make all things new isvery old in China and has often resulted in changes in the calendar aftertimes of social crisis. It would be some time after the adoption of a re-formed solar calendar before the loss of astronomical utility through aban-donment of the lunar 384-day calendar would be realized. After such atime, from the middle Chou onward, the knowledge of how to constructthe lunar calendar may have existed only in scattered fragments and cryp-tic sayings such as represent the earliest extant commentary material onthe / Ching. Wilhelm (1964) reproduces this material as the Shuo Kua—Discussion of the Trigrams. Some of the ambiguities in this material seemto be dissipated by the assumption that a hierarchical hexagram sequencecalendar is being referred to.The relative clumsiness of the traditional Chinese calendar seems tolend support to this idea that it conceals an older, reformed lunar calen-dar. The traditional Chinese calendar had an average length of 360 days,into which two intercalary months were inserted every five years. Thismeans that a lunar year of twelve months would have 354.4 days per year,which is 5.6 days short of the average duration of 360 days. The solar year,on the other hand, is 5.25 days longer than the 360-day year. When 10.85,the sum of 5.25 + 5.6, is taken times 5 (the five years into which the two in-tercalary months are inserted), the result is 54.26 days, which is approxi-mately five days less than exactly two lunar months. These calculationsshow that, in spite of the insertion of the two extra lunar months everyfive years, this calendar—if we assume lunar months of 29.53 days wereused—would still gain 4.8 days every five years; compare this to the loss ofone day every 454.5 lunar years for a thirteen-month lunar year of 384days, with only one intercalary day every ten years. This latter represents alevel of accuracy improved by a factor of many thousands. Even in com-parison with the Gregorian calendar in use in the modern West, this cal-endar is more accurate by a factor well over one hundred. The Gregoriancalendar adds one day every four years; the / Ching calendar adds one dayevery 454.5 of its 384-day years, with the insertion of one intercalary dayfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (149 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmevery ten years. Even without this latter insertion, the proposed / Chinglunar calendar is more than twice as accurate as the Gregorian.Insight into the Chinese view of calendars and their makers is affordedby examination of hexagram 49, Revolution. Hexagram 49 specificallyconnects great revolutions with calendrical reforms, and the Confuciancommentary on the Image goes further and specifically connects the roleof the shaman with that of a calendar maker: The Image: Fire in theLake, the Image of Revolution. Thus the Superior Man sets the calendarin order and makes the seasons clear (Wilhelm 1964, p. 201). The Com-mentary interprets in part as follows: Arrangement of the calendar is sug-gested by Tui which means a magician, a calendar maker (Wilhelm 1964,p. 202). The Judgment adds:Times change, and with them their demands. Thus the seasonschange ... In the world cycle also there are Spring and Autumnin the life of peoples and nations, and all these call for social trans-formations ... In the course of the year a combat takes placebetween the forces of light. . . and . . . of darkness, eventuatingin the revolution of the seasons. Man masters these changes innature by noting their regularity and marking off the passageof time accordingly. In this way order and clarity appear in theapparently chaotic changes of the seasons, and man is able toadjust himself in advance to the demands of the different times.(Wilhelm 1964, p. 202)In the above, we suggest that the changes of the seasons may be apoor translation; since the progress of the seasons is not apparentlychaotic, a cycle of epochs or psychological seasons may be indicated.This entire passage appears to obliquely refer to the kinds of temporalcycles hidden in the / Ching and to hint at its esoteric function as a cal-endar and astronomical calculator.Chapter 9Order in the / Ching and Order in the WorldL. L. Whyte pinpointed the problem at the center of the crisis in biologyfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (150 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmin his Internal Factors in Evolution (1965). Whyte says this:The fundamental spatial and temporal laws of the developingorganization of local processes are still obscure.What is missing? Possibly knowledge of certain crucial facts,but certainly a sufficiently clear formulation of the problem. Wecannot expect to understand organization until we know whatwe are looking for in terms of mathematics [italics mine]. The useof mathematical standards alone can clarify the aim of a theory oforganization . . . The mathematical task, as I see it, is to identifythe Coordinative Conditions (C.C.), i.e., the general algebraic con-ditions expressing the biological spatio-temporal coordination, therules of ordering which must be satisfied (to within a threshold)by the internal parts and processes of any cellular organism capa-ble of developing and surviving in some environment. The C.C.are the expression of geometrical, 3D, or perhaps kinematic rulesdetermining the necessary 3D or spatio-temporal network of therelations of the atoms, ions, molecules, organelles, etc., in a viableorganism. They are necessary in the individual, not merely statisti-cal over assemblies. The C.C. must cover all the fundamentalaspects of the unity of organisms . . .The C.C. are not merely morphological, expressing relativespatial positions and orientations within the ordered system (notin an arbitrary external frame), but morphogenetic, representinga one-way tendency towards the development of stationary forms.In other words the C.C. not only define an invariant characteristicconfiguration which tends to persist through all the normal trans-formations of the system (i.e., through growth, functioning,reproduction, etc.) but also a dynamic tendency towards orderedequilibrium, i.e., a self-ordered and self-stabilizing process. Thusthe C.C. are the mathematical conditions which cover not onlythe homeostatic (feed-back control, etc.) properties of the organ-ism, but also its one-way development. Indeed from a logical andmathematical point of view the stationary properties must besecondary consequences, arising under limiting conditions, of aone-way developmental principle. Ontogenetic development istheoretically primary to homeostasis and cyclic function.file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (151 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmThe C.C. may be a single set of conditions applying at alllevels of structure, from the nucleus of the germ cells to the organ-ism as a whole, or they may be a hierarchy of conditions. They arecertainly strong, in the sense that they impose a high degree oforder, but they are not maximal, for they leave many parametersfree to vary (fluid regions, flexibility, mobility, learning, successfulmutations, etc.). (pp. 33-36)Whyte discusses the schema of Coordinative Conditions as they mightbe applied to living systems. Our own thought, in accordance with theformative first principle of organismic philosophy as developed by White-head (cf. chapter 3), has been to extend the idea of organism to all pro-cesses and systems in the universe and therefore to seek a general systemstheory or set of C.C. quite as applicable to events on the macrogalactic orinner-atomic levels as to the specifically biological realm. As Albert Wil-son points out:It is interesting to note that the gravitational potential of the uni-verse is near the Schwartzchild Limit, the theoretical maximalvalue for potential. These quantitative equivalences indicate thatthere probably exist basic causal qualitative relations between thestructure of the universe and the properties of the atom and itsnucleus (the question of the direction of causality being open).(A. Wilson, in Whyte et al. 1969, p. 120)Whyte (1965), amplifies the character of the system theory being sought:It will be recalled that the C.C. are the algebraic expression of the3D geometrical and kinetic conditions determining the spatial andtemporal relations of parts and process in all viable organisms.Our assumption here is that the conception of the C.C. and theiractual form will one day be as commonplace to structural biolo-gists as Maxwell's equations are now to physicists. The C.C. areout there in nature, just as much as Maxwell's equations. Whatcan be said of them today?They are certainly set in 3D space, not in some higher abstractmanifold. They are time-scaled, i.e., contain natural units offile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (152 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmlength and time (or the equivalent), though in many circum-stances organic structures and processes vary greatly in spatial andtemporal scale. Moreover, the C.C. probably employ collectiveparameters, i.e., global variables associated with organic systems asa whole and their internal relations, and not with ultimate parts.The C.C. must be capable of representing both relatively stablestructures and the formative processes which generate them . . .. . . What is missing? Individual structural facts covering sta-tionary aspects are being collected at an unprecedented rate, butthe basic theoretical principles of a structural and dynamic synthe-sis are lacking. What character must these principles possess?What must be their aim?The answer is surely beyond doubt. What is lacking is a mathe-matical conception of the character of the unity of organism, and oforganic subunits. . . (pp. 103ff.)Whyte goes on to pose seven questions inviting further research, threeof which have special import for our own work:4. In view of the unique theoretical scope of chiral (skew orscrew) forms which are capable of determining both polar-electri-cal and axial-magnetic correlations, and of the prevalence of helicalarrangements and left-handed amino acids in organisms, are theC.C. related to helical pulsations, i.e., to change in helical angles?5. Do all vital processes involve pulsating structures undergoingsimultaneous cycles of geometrical deformation and electro-mag-netic polarization? If so do mutated genotypes have to be capable ofconforming to such pulsations?6. Are the C.C. the expression of an ordering tendency, relatedto the movement towards minimum potential energy of complexlow temperature systems, which can account both for the genesisof life and for its maintenance? (1965, pp. iio-iii)With all of the preceding in mind, we now advance to our own versionof the Coordinative Conditions and their interrelationships. Our opera-tional premise has been that cognitive categories, memories, mentation,and even archetypal deep structures are phenomena whose genesis is to besought in conformational changes at the molecular level; specifically, thatfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (153 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmsuch mental phenomena reflect dynamic processes and structural modifi-cations mediated by DNA during the performance of its function ofhomeostatically regulating the organism and its storing of information asreflexes and memories. This premise, that cognitive categories reflect orga-nizing principles at work in the physical structure of the human organism,allows us to examine abstract and symbolic systems of thought from anew point of view, from a point of view that asks, What do the structuresof rituals, divinatory processes, and other appealing and persistent, yetnonrational idea systems reflect concerning the physical organizationschema that lie at the foundation of brain and mind? This method wasanticipated by Jung, who examined myth and religion to reveal the struc-ture and dynamics of the psyche.There can be little doubt that Jung regarded the / Ching as a repositoryof archetypes, just as the / Ching says of itself that it contains the cate-gories of all that is. Stilling of the heart techniques, physical techniquesthat retard normal autonomic processes and allow deep and sustained pe-riods of inspection of the organization of the psyche are at the heart ofTaoist yoga and Chinese alchemical thinking. It seems conceivable that, ifone grants that the organization of the psyche reflects the organization ofits physical foundations, shamanic and yogic techniques that allow deepinsight into the organization of consciousness and its categories mightalso allow their practitioners to gain an intuitional sense of the nature ofphysical organization. In the West, the Pythagoreans exemplify an earlyphilosophical school in possession of ecstatic techniques and concernedwith the organization of matter. It is reasonable to suggest that these con-cerns were congruent in ancient China as well. Our intuition has beenthat consciousness could not fail to reflect the shifting modalities of theenergy continuum of metabolism that is its ground. We believe time to benot a homogeneous medium, but a flux of variables or a field of nonsto-chastic perturbations of the flow of probability. We feel that the quantumtheory was the announcement of the discovery of these laws in micro-physical systems, and that elucidation of the nature of organism willsomehow involve the extension of the idea of temporal variables into a hi-erarchical theory that recognizes quantized flux phenomena at every levelof space-time organization.The King Wen sequence of the / Ching represents for us, as well as forthe ancient Chinese, a neolithic intuition concerning the structure of psy-file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (154 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmchic time, arrived at through the slow growth of folk traditions concerningthe nature and order of the internal categories. As mind arises out of or-ganism and organism out of inorganic matter, is it possible that the /Ching sequence holds a reflection not only of psychic organization but alsoof the nature and order of the temporal variables that are its stated concernto describe? Such variables may be the formative boundary conditionswith which evolving life had to cope, and which it came to reflect. In judg-ing this hypothesis, we should not lose sight of the fact that all science isdone in just this way; flashes of creative insight, which are nothing morethan revelation of the organization of the psyche, are found to map ontoa part of reality and thus are validated as true. Experiment always plays apart in such a process; we cannot know if experiments, as we would con-ceive them, were ever undertaken with regard to these theories. We knownothing of the methods of pre-Han science. The / Ching appears occult tothe West, since we have an automatic assumption concerning the nature oftime and causality. But this assumption hides from us the nature of timeand organism. Perhaps the ancient Chinese were not so unfortunate. Thedependency of Western physical science on physical instrumentality is sogreat that we cannot imagine achieving insight into the organization ofmatter without such instruments. Actually, an advanced psychology mightachieve insight into the C.C. through entirely internalized techniques ofmanipulating and observing the organism. Since long before history, suchtechniques have been the special province of the shaman.Before turning to the King Wen sequence of the sixty-four hexagrams ofthe / Ching and what that sequence may reveal of the order of the temporalvariables, we should first examine some of the special properties that arepossessed by the number sixty-four apart from any other considerations.It is well known that sixty-four codons, of three nucleotide units, areused by DNA and RNA to specify amino acids used in protein synthesis.What is not so well known is the rule proposed by the anthropologist An-thony E C. Wallace that limits the maximum number of entities that canbe contained in a folk taxonomy to sixty-four. Since a taxonomy is amap of conceptual categories, his idea has importance for our own the-ory of conscious organization:. . . The hypothesis, which we shall call the 2[to the 6th power] Rule, is, then,that irrespective of race, culture, or evolutionary level, culturally insti-file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (155 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmtutionalized folk taxonomies will not contain more than 2[to the 6th power] entitiesand consequently will not require more than six orthogonallyrelated binary dimensions for the definitions of all of the terms[italics his].... In the area of cultural semantics, we are suggesting that asomewhat similar principle applies. . . the evolution of culturalcomplexity is limited, in so far as folk taxonomies are concerned, bythe two-to-the-sixth-power rule [italics his] . . . What is limited isthe complexity of the taxonomies which are components of thevarious cultural sub-systems. (Wallace 1961, p. 462)The / Ching is just such a taxonomy, a group of symbols . . . which de-note mutually exclusive but jointly exhaustive subsets of referents within aset denoted by a cover symbol and which (unlike names) are defined byunique combinations of values on two or more conceptual dimensions (Wallace 1961, p. 462).Wallaces work supports our contention that there is a definite relationbetween the categories of experiential archetypes and the numerical foun-dations of the / Ching. With that fact as a beginning, we turn our atten-tion to the King Wen sequence of the sixty-four hexagrams to seek thenature of the order of that sequence for what it might reveal about timeand metabolism.The earliest arrangement of the hexagrams of the / Ching is the KingWen sequence. It was this sequence that was chosen to be studied as a pos-sible basis for a new model of the relationship of time to the ingressionand conservation of novelty. In studying the kinds of order in the KingWen sequence of the / Ching a number of remarkable discoveries weremade. It is well known that hexagrams in the King Wen sequence occur inpairs. The second member of each pair is obtained by inverting the first.In any sequence of the sixty-four hexagrams there are eight hexagramsthat remain unchanged when inverted. In the King Wen sequence, theseeight hexagrams are paired with hexagrams in which each line of the firsthexagram has become its opposite (yang changed to yin and vice versa).The question remains as to what rule or principle governs the arrange-file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (156 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmment of the thirty-two pairs of hexagrams comprising the King Wen se-quence. Here we find ourselves in an intellectual terra incognita; noknown basis exists for determining why pairs are arranged as they are orwhy one member of a pair precedes another. Our intuition in seeking a so-lution to these problems was to look at the first order of difference. Firstorder of difference refers to how many lines change as one moves throughthe King Wen sequence from one hexagram to the next. The first order ofdifference will always be an integer between one and six. When the firstorder of difference within pairs is examined it is always found to be aneven number. Thus all instances of odd values for the first order of differ-ence occur at transitions from one pair of hexagrams to the next pair.When the complete set of first order of difference integers generated by theKing Wen sequence is examined, they are found to fall into a perfect ratioof three to one; three even integers to each odd integer. The ratio of threeto one is not a formal property of any or most sequences but was a care-fully constructed artifact achieved by arranging hexagram transitions be-tween pairs to generate fourteen instances of three and two instances ofone. Fives were deliberately excluded. This exclusion of fives is also not anecessary property of the system. We may be sure that the King Wen se-quence has been consciously constructed to discriminate against a changeof five lines as one moves from one hexagram to another through the se-quence. The case of hexagrams 38 and 39 is particularly instructive in thisregard.Previously we noted that, as a natural consequence of the system, therewould be eight instances where inverting a hexagram would have no effect,and so all lines must be changed to their opposites. When we examineTable II (fig. 17), however, we find that there are in fact nine such cases.One, the synthetic case, is the transition from 38 to 39. If the arrangementof the thirty-two pairs was random, we could expect other instances wherethe second term in one pair and the first term in the following pair hap-pened to be opposites with an order of difference of six. But, in fact, thissituation occurs in the sequence only in this one case. If there was a con-scious effort to include only the eight necessary pairs with the differencesof six, why was the additional occurrence of the value allowed? The answerappears to be directly related to the absence of first order of difference val-ues of five noted above. If the order of the natural pair 39 and 40 were tobe reversed, the value of the change between 39 and 41, which would thenfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (157 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmfollow 39, would be five. The fourteen threes and two ones constitute six-teen instances of an odd integer occurring out of a possible sixty-four. Thisis a three to one ratio exactly. As it is a property of the system that the tran-sition values within pairs will give even values, we can conclude that of thetransition values that could be consciously manipulated in a final arrange-ment, those were chosen in which the odd and even transitions wereequally and exactly apportioned.Our conclusion is that the King Wen sequence was ordered, aside fromthe already stated rules that generate the hexagram pairs, on the followingrules:1. Order among the thirty-two pairs was determined by a wish to ab-solutely exclude transition situations with a value of five.table II Change in the King Wen Sequence(First Order of Difference between Sequential Hexagrams)HEXAGRAM 1 = 6 HEXAGRAM 17 = 6 HEXAGRAM 33 = 4 HEXAGRAM 49 = 42 = 2 18 3 34 = 4 50 = 43 = 4 19 4 35=4 5i = 44 = 4 20 3 36=2 52 = 15 = 4 21 2 37 = 4 53 = 66 = 3 22 2 38 = 6 54 = 27 = 2 23 2 39 =4 55 =2.8 = 4 24 3 40 =3 56 =39 = 2 25 4 41 = 2 57 = 410 = 4 26 2 42 = 4 58 = 311 = 6 27 6 43 = 2 59 = 212 = 2 28 2 44 = 3 60 = 113 = 2 29 6 45 = 4 61 = 614 = 4 30 3 46 =3 62 =315 = 2 31 2 47 = 2 63 = 616 = 2 32 3 48 =3 64 =3Value Times occurring % of 64.

Order among the thirty-two pairs was secondarily determined by asimilar wish to absolutely exclude transition situations with a value of one,except in cases where this would interfere with rule (1). (Note: Only twoinstances of transitions with a value of one occur, and both cases occur insituations where reversing the members of the pairs involved [pairs 53-54and 61-62] would cause transition values of five.)3. A three to one ratio of even to odd transitions was maintained.As if these synthetic symmetries were not enough, in addition we findthat when the first order of difference of the King Wen sequence is graphedit appears random or unpredictable (fig. 18A). However, when an image ofthe graph is rotated 180 degrees within the plane and superimposed uponitself, it is found to achieve closure at four adjacent points (fig. 18B).While this closure might logically be expected anywhere in the sequence,it in fact occurs at the conventional beginning and end of the sequence.More than 1.2 million hexagram sequences were randomly generated bycomputer (all sequences having the property possessed by the King Wen se-quence that every second hexagram is either the inverse or the complementof its predecessor). Of these 1.2 million Wen-like sequences, 805 were foundto have the properties of a three to one ratio of even to odd transitions, nofile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (159 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmtransitions of value five, and the type of closure described previously. Suchsequences were found to be very rare, occurring in only .07 cases or approxi-mately one in every 1,769 of the Wen-like sequences.For these reasons we were led to view the King Wen sequence as a pro-foundly artificial arrangement of the sixty-four hexagrams. Look carefullyat figure 18B. Review in your mind the steps from the King Wen sequencethat led to it. Notice that it is a complete set of the sixty-four possiblehexagrams, running sequentially both forward and backward. Since it iscomposed of sixty-four hexagrams of six lines each, it is composed of 6 X64 lines or 384 lines or yao. One might make an analogy and say that fig-ure 18B is to the King Wen sequence as a cube is to a square. Figure 18B iscomposed of the same elements as the King Wen sequence but it has moredimensions.The point that we wish to make in this discussion is that the first orderof difference among the hexagrams, as they are read in a linear sequence,was consciously and deliberately ordered in very ancient times. Why thiswas done we cannot yet say, but the fact that it was done validates our con-tention the these mathematical qualities of the / Ching were factors ofwhich the neolithic Chinese were well aware. Whether they graphed thefirst order of difference, as we have done in figures 18A and B, is moot.Graphing is not necessary; simple numerical quantification of the orders ofdifference gives the idea of the continuum of the sequence. Nevertheless,establishing the values of the first order of difference among the hexagramsfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (160 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (161 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htm as a conscious part of the pre-Han traditions causes us to believe that it isvalid to examine the graph to see why such care was taken with the orderof its first order of difference values.Although the graph appears relatively unstructured, it is evident that itcontains a singularity: The first and last three positions of the graph arecongruent mirror images of each other. Thus, congruence occurs at bothends of the graph when it is rotated in two dimensions and placed next toitself (cf. fig. 18B). While an arrangement with closure might have placedany two hexagrams opposite each other, what we in fact find is that thehexagrams opposite each other are such that the numbers of their positionsin the King Wen sequence when summed are always equal to sixty-four.The graph that this whole process generates (fig. 18B), or at least thetwo columns of value differences that are its numerical equivalent, seemsto us to have been at the basis of the King Wen sequence. Our case hasbeen thus far, we hope, a logical extension of qualities clearly important tothose who organized the / Ching into the King Wen sequence.Now we will turn to the question, why was this particular sequence offirst orders of difference so important? What did it mean to its makers;what were they seeking to model with it? In chapter 8 we attempted to rea-son toward the structure of a multileveled hierarchical calendar that we be-lieve was used in pre-Han China, a calendar based on the / Ching andsimple mathematical extrapolations of it. In the present chapter we haveargued that the King Wen sequence was ordered so as to give special atten-tion to the first order of difference among the hexagrams, when they aretaken in linear order. The nature of the first and last three of these first-order-of-difference values suggests that each was designed to be pairedwith its opposite number in a reversed sequence to form a backward- andforward-running continuum of the first order of difference. This contin-uum may be numerically displayed or actually graphed as in figure 18B.To answer the question, Why was this done? we must recall the prin-ciples used to construct the calendrical hierarchy that emerged from chap-ter 8. We believe those principles should be applied to the graphicportrayal of the continuum of the backward- and forward-running se-quence that the wave of figure 18B represents. Figure 18B is a graphic pic-ture of the entire sequence of the / Ching, yet we propose that it wasfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (162 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmtreated as the smallest unit in a series of hierarchical macro-hexagrams. Inother words, we believe that the oracle-constructing Chinese viewed thecomplete set of forward- and backward-running valuations of the firstorder of difference of the King Wen sequence as equivalent to a line, a yao,and, therefore, open to the same manipulation as lines are subject to inthe / Ching and the / Ching calendar; that is, multiplication by six andsixty-four.Above, we stated the opinion that these operations were undertakenwith a desire to portray what was known to the Chinese concerningtime—observations made on the basis of a sophisticated and interiorizedpsychological view of the world. We believe that the quantum-mechanicalparameters of mind eventually may have become accessible to observationand description through such an approach. A perfected organismic psy-chology might have evolved into a science of process in organism at everylevel of organization far more easily than the static Western physical sci-ences. The world as dynamic process, an idea basic to Vedic and Taoistviewpoints, makes the wave mechanics of postquantum physics seemquite natural, although in the Western scientific tradition it marks an ex-treme reorganization of thought that involves nothing less than the aban-donment of determinism and materialism.To extend our hypothesis, we will consider the space-time continuumas a modular wave-hierarchy. This hierarchy is composed of waves thathave, on the most simple level, the configuration that is generated by fig-ure 18B. The energy map of changes plotted backward upon itself formspairs that, when added together, always equal sixty-four. The graph wasseemingly constructed to be superimposed backward upon itself, suggest-ing to us that time was understood to function with the same holographicproperties that have long been an accepted part of the phenomenon of theperception of three-dimensional space. This also suggests that interferencepatterns are characteristic of process. Living beings especially illustrate this:They are an instance of the superimposition of many different chemicalwaves, waves of gene expression and of gene inhibition, waves of energy re-lease and energy consumption, forming the standing wave interferencepatterns characteristic of life.We hypothesize that the wave description generated by this combiningof the two graph lines is the simple form of a more complex wave that uti-file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (163 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmlizes the simple wave of figure 18B as the primary unit in a system of suchunits, combined in the same way as lines are combined into trigrams andthen hexagrams in the / Ching (cf. fig. 19). We will argue that this morecomplex wave (fig. 19) is a kind of temporal map of the changing bound-ary conditions that exist in space and time, including future time. Time,like light, may best be described as a union of opposites. Time may beboth wave and, ultimately, particle, each in some sense a reflection of theother. We have called the quantized wave-particle, whatever its level of oc-currence within the hierarchy or its duration, eschaton (fig. 19):. . . Koestler addresses the question of what to call entities thatbelong to hierarchical systems. They have two aspects, ... thefunctional units on every level of the hierarchy are double-faced asit were; they act as wholes when facing downwards, as parts whenfacing upwards. (Koestler 1967.) He elects to designate theseJanus-faced entities by the term holon (from the Greek holos =whole plus the suffix on as in proton or neutron suggesting a par-ticle or part). We note that Gerard uses the term org to designatethe same concept. . . (D. Wilson, in Whyte et al. 1969, p. 288)This construct may best be understood as a reflection in the temporaldimension of the patterns that impart structural order to organisms andtheir view of the world. Space-time within this idea model is entirely com-posed of these hierarchically nested waves. Each such wave is exactly likeall the others, their differences arising out of their relational positions inthe hierarchy. Each wave, by itself, contains the entire modular hierarchythrough its being a reflection of organization on higher and lower levels inan extensive continuum (cf. fig. 19). These wave systems, in duplicatingthemselves on various levels, lose none of their original properties. Wehoped to map temporal variables using a wave-mechanical and holo-graphic theory which holds that the ingression of novelty into the tempo-ral continuum might conform to the wave described in figures 18B and 19.The claim that any spatiotemporal span can be described by wave me-chanics may sound deterministic, but such is not the case. The nature oftime is conditioned by space and vice versa, so that the individual, by util-izing energy in proper ways, can go to the places and think the thoughtsthat will hold him (within the vicissitudes of the wave-hierarchy as it con-stellates his historical position) as close to an ideal as possible. An organ-ism is confronted with possibilities just as a particle is confronted withprobabilities:file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (164 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmThe initial state will be represented, complete with the uncertain-ties which it involves, by a certain initial form of the associatedwave. The later changes of the wave can be predicted exactly bythe equations of Wave Mechanics: but this does not mean anabsolute Determinism for the corpuscle, since knowledge of thewave at every instant only enables us to assign certain probabilitiesto the various hypotheses tenable as to the position and momen-tum of the corpuscle. In a word, then, while the older Mechanicsclaimed to apply exact and inexorable laws to every phenomenon,file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (165 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htm file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (166 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (167 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htm the new Physics only gives us laws of probability, and thoughthese can be expressed in exact formulae, they still remain laws ofprobability. Thus in every physical phenomenon there remains amargin of uncertainty; and it is possible to ascertain that this mar-gin of uncertainty is measured, in a way, by the constant, h. Figu-ratively, it has been said that there was a crack in the wall ofphysical Determinism, whose size was measured by Planck's con-stant, h; and thus the latter receives a somewhat unexpected inter-pretation: it is supposed to be the limiting barrier ofDeterminism. (De Broglie 1970, p. 246)These ideas have implications for the physicist, philosopher, and psy-chologist. Simply put, we are saying that the wave-hierarchy of energythat regulates the ingression of novelty into time thus constellates theworld of our experience in its entirety and therefore also in all of its pos-sible subsets, so that in any span of time or space, if one can determinewhere to begin the generation of the wave description, space-time underexamination will be quantified relative to an ideal zero state to as great adepth as one wishes to resolve the levels in the wave-hierarchy This expli-cation is quantitative, and yet may also utilize the linguistic frameworkthat the / Ching commentaries provide.Chapter 10The King Wen Sequence as aQuantified Modular HierarchyChapter 9 introduced the simple wave we have construed out of the KingWen sequence through a particular graphing technique. In chapter 9, useof the simple wave as the primary unit in a modular hierarchy was alludedto and exhibits were offered to demonstrate the ordering principles of theKing Wen sequence. This simple wave of the backward- and forward-running transitions in a single complete King Wen sequence of the /Ching (fig. 18B) can easily serve to model the physical structure of a singlehelical strand of DNA and its transformations: replication, duplication, and RNA transcription. These are in vitro functions of DNA and do notfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (168 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmshed light on the dynamic and harmonic relations that exist in the in vivo world of the cell nucleus. The single-strand functions of DNA are wellunderstood, but systems properties that appear in a living cell have noteven begun to be clarified.If the constant intercalation of 5HT into bond sites between codons,now a recognized part of 5HT metabolism (cf. fig. 9), does significantlyalter ESR patterns in DNA, then it seemed likely to us that interferencepatterns that such a shifting of ESR signatures would generate might pro-vide the mechanism for the hologramatic standing wave that the livingsystem has developed to model within itself the world it encounters be-yond itself. Only 10 percent of DNA is involved in protein synthesis. Thefunctions of the other 90 percent are uncertain, but we suggest that an or-ganism's entire internal horizon of experience is created and maintainedin the energy continuum, which neural DNA regulates and maintains.Thought and reflection may be holographic functions that take placeagainst the background of the energy flow of metabolism that DNA con-trols. It is this flow of energy that is experienced by organisms as the phe-nomenon of time itself. Organisms evolved in and became patterned inresponse to this flow.We hoped to apply the idea of a modular hierarchy to the simple wave,using the kinds of resonance cycles our calendrical studies implied, andthus to generate maps of the continuum of temporal variables. If our spec-ulation is sound, such maps should function as graphs of the continuumof metabolic energy, which we call time, and should thus have relevanceto the individual and to his or her life—the ontogenetic expression ofDNA—as well as to history or species' time, which is DNA's phylogeneticexpression. To do this, we have chosen to treat the simple wave (fig. 18B),which is itself a composite expression of the entire / Ching, as a primaryunit in a hierarchy in which every level is structured on the same principlesas are the levels above and below it. This is termed a modular hierarchy:The central idea in a modular hierarchy is the module which isa structure or a system that may be regarded both as a whole, de-composible into submodules identified with a lower level, and as apart combinable into super-modules identified with a higher level.file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (169 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htm. . . The term module being used here in this general senseneed not be precisely defined, however, we may ascribe two funda-mental properties to modules. First, a module possesses some sortof closure or partial closure (Wilson 1969). This closure may betopological, temporal, or defined by some operational rule as ingroup theory. Second, modules possess a degree of semi-autonomywith respect to other modules and to their context. These twoproperties appear to be common in all modular hierarchies. (A.Wilson, in Whyte et al. 1969, p. 115)Recall from chapter 8 that the primary unit in the / Ching is the line, oryao. A full sequence of sixty-four hexagrams contains 384 yao. Hierarchi-cally situated above the yao is the hexagram, composed of six yao, whichtraditionally has been divided into two subunits of three lines each. Suchsubunits are called trigrams, and two trigrams form one hexagram. Follow-ing the same principles of construction, we have arranged six simple graphsin sequential order. These are analogous to the six lines of a hexagram.Over these we have superimposed, in sequential order, two more simplewaves, each three times the size of the six small waves. These two largerwaves are equivalent to the two trigrams in any hexagram. Superimposedover the sequence of six and two is a final simple wave, standing for the en-tire hexagram, a single wave six times larger than the six waves on the pri-mary level and twice as large as the two waves on the intermediate level (cf.fig. 19). The three-leveled structure thus generated is a more detailed ver-sion of the simple graph (fig. 18B) and is analogous to a hexagram. Whenthis modular hierarchy is extended to further levels, this complex wave pre-serves the relation of a single hexagram to the entire / Ching sequence, be-coming part of a still larger hierarchy of which it is only 1/64 of the whole.Each tri-leveled module exists as 1/64 of a still larger module. Such a com-plex wave has at its primary level 384 parts in sixty-four primary subunits,just as the complete / Ching sequence of sixty-four hexagrams has 384 yao.We know that a duration of 384 days is nearly exactly thirteen lunar cycles.Given this and the idea that organic macromolecules may have arisen in re-sponse to periodicities in astrophysical forces, especially gravity, we suggestthat lunar cycles may have had a formative influence on the structural or-ganization of the DNA. We also speculate that a cycle of lunar influencesof 384 days' duration may be a kind of natural calendar important to all lifethat has evolved on earth. Such a 384-day lunar cycle would be a primarycycle of biological importance and might be a subset in a hierarchy sixty-file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (170 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmfour times larger than itself. We have called such a 384-day cycle a lunaryear and believe such a year to be but one level in a hierarchy of many lev-els, each described by the wave of figure 19.Such a hierarchy would require twenty-six levels to describe the totalityof temporal existence. Our assumption was that figure 19 is descriptive ofall, and any one, of these levels. When figure 19 is used as a 384-day lunarcalendar, each day is entirely under the hexagramatic influence of threepairs of hexagrams, one part on each of the three levels. It is the influenceof smaller cycles on each level (cf. Table III, fig. 20) that adds the color, tone, and feel to the experience of being, and it is these lesser scales andthe interphases between them that are responsible for those minute par-ticulars that give life its depth and ambiguity and render a deterministicprediction concerning a spatiotemporal moment impossible. General pre-dictions based on larger time scales form the empirical basis of our investi-gation of this sort of / Ching hierarchy and its relation to time.A lunar year is a temporal process that forms a hexagram, a total energygestalt, in space-time. This form requires 6 X 64 days to complete, becauseit is composed of six parts (lines or yao), each of which requires sixty-fourdays to complete itself. Not only is a lunar year 1/64 of a larger cycle, whichis 1/64 of a still larger cycle (cf. Table I, fig. 16), but the lunar year is itselfcomposed of sixty-four parts, each described by the same complex wavethat models it. These hexagrams are of six days' duration. Such six-daycycles are themselves wholes composed of sixty-four parts, each a replica ofthe whole and so on down through shorter and shorter cycles until cyclesare reached whose duration is on the order of Planck's constant. Furtherdivision of time cycles has no meaning for physics, and so it is here that di-visions cease. It is at this level that the modular hierarchy has its groundand origin. Our view is that various temporal levels are overtonal harmon-ics of a quantum-mechanical flux of cyclical and irreducible temporal vari-ables. If one entertains the idea that our universe may possess such a timescheme, one is led to contemplate the problem of the nature and necessityfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (171 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (172 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htm scheme, one is led to contemplate the problem of the nature and necessityof the final time such a theory requires.The eventual result of a self-enfolding of the temporal continuum atlevels of the hierarchy of long duration might be likened to a visible con-densation of the hologram of mind expressed as a radiant image, a stand-ing waveform. Organisms are involved in a process of endlessly refiningtheir cognition of the world. No final projection of the nature of this phe-nomenon can be made, and, in fact, even though every statement is a partof the truth, it is also very much defined by the boundary conditionsunder which it was formulated. During the second century, the Alexan-drian thinkers, specifically Clement, focused their attention, when dealingwith the Apocalypse, on the nature of the resurrection body; the questionof the time of the appearance of the Son of Man was deemed a matter oflesser interest:In that Great Day men will be reunited to their bodies. This is theundoubted assurance of the Scripture. But it constituted one ofthe great difficulties of the time. Christians were perplexed by it;heathen controversialists poured upon it unmixed ridicule andscorn. Origen, like Clement, found a solution of all his doubts inthe teaching of St. Paul; but he refined upon this in a way peculiarto himself. The resurrection body will be the same that we nowinhabit, and yet not the same. Not the same because spiritual andglorious, because again its material substance will be entirely dif-ferent. Yet the same, as our body of today is the same with ourbody of twenty years ago; every particle is changed, yet the bodyas a whole is not changed. The soul has a vital assimilative spark or principle, which lays hold of fitting matter, and shapes it intoa habitation suited to its needs. The same process by which it re-pairs the daily waste of our organisms now will enable it then toconstruct a wholly new tenament for itself. The Origenist monksare said to have believed that the Resurrection Body would bespherical, and this opinion is charged upon Origen by Justinian.(Bigg 1913, pp. 271-272)file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (173 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmThe theory of shared genetic memory and DNA bioelectronic reflec-tion of its environment may yet yield sufficient data for a relatively clearunderstanding of humanity's (and the shaman's) persistent intuition of anafterlife and the collective transformation, which we suspect is imminentand is creating the present shock of chaos at the end of history. The ques-tion of the moment of this true rupture of plane is difficult; it seems mostmillenarian speculations decode as giving critical importance to the age inwhich they were composed.In a modular hierarchy of space-time such as we propose, the total en-ergy resident in the continuum can be supposed to be totally resident ineach resonant subset. This idea follows necessarily from the assumption oforganismic thought that the entire hierarchical continuum is resident in itsmodular parts. The fold of temporal limitation and particularity that de-fines a nexus of space-time is the place where modes of connection typicalof a higher spatial dimension ingress into the world of normal space-time.That place is, in a sense, everywhere; that is, it is potentially anywhere. Themodules are members of a quantized, or discretely expressed, hierarchicalstructure that on each level manifests the same form met in the primarylevel. The problem of the moment of the involution of such a temporal hi-erarchy into its short epochs is interesting. As moderns and necessarilyskeptics, we have assumed that although the hypothesis points toward aneventual involution of the temporal manifold, a concrescence, there is littlelikelihood of such an event occurring in the immediate present.We believe space-time to be a flux of novelty whose variables are pre-dictable. Using this supposition, we shall attempt to quantify the ebb andflow of temporal parameters and, thus, to chart the future course of novelingressions into space-time (cf. Appendix). This is not, in principle, a dif-ficult task. What is required is a logically coherent technique for assigninga quantified value to every point in the modular hierarchy. Empirical in-vestigation of a hypothesis of a flux of temporal parameters cannot go for-ward until this is done. Quantification of every point in the hierarchy,with the ideal and terminal state quantified as zero, would give a relativescale of values. We used these relative values to map the intensity of nov-elty's ingression into the history of space-time. We did this to research thecontention that this schema does map novelty's ingression into the realworld. Only through quantification can a consensus concerning the mean-ing of the wave be achieved; otherwise, the wave and its interpretation arefile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (174 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmno better than a mystical doctrine. We have achieved a quantification ofthe wave through a set of operations that are at once logically rigorous andat the same time preserve our intuitions concerning what the graph is. Ourattack on this problem began with an examination of the simple wave offigure 18B.Thirteen discrete line types comprise any simple version of the graph.These thirteen lengths are displayed in figure 21. As these lengths arefile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (175 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmalways discrete units, we can assign to them values that are ascending inte-gers. The values in figure 21 allow a quantification of line length. To quan-tify the degree and direction of skew of individual lines, one direction ofskew is designated as positive, giving lines skewed in that direction posi-tive values. Lines skewed in the opposite direction are given negative val-ues. This gives values adequately preserving and quantifying line lengthand direction of skew. The values labeled L in figure 21 are used for theleft side of a simple wave while the values labeled R, which are the samevalues but with their sign reversed, are applied to the right side of any sim-ple wave. Since the sign is important only in combining values acrossscales but is ignored in the final graphing of combined values, either set ofvalues may be applied to either the right or left side. However, whicheverschema is chosen must then be followed throughout. Figure 22 representsthe version of the values of the simple graph that we have used.It is important to note that the valuations in figure 22 are valuations ofthe simple wave on the smallest scale of a single complex wave. The rela-tive proportions of the three levels in the complex wave are preserved andquantified by multiplying the valuations of the linear scale in the appro-priate way. To assign a value to a position on the trigramatic scale, the val-uation of that position on the linear scale (fig. 22) is multiplied by threebecause the trigramatic scale is three times larger than the linear scale. In asimilar manner, the hexagramatic positions are assigned a valuation bymultiplying their linear-level valuations by six, again because the hexagra-matic scale is six times larger than the linear. Figure 22 uses the valuescheme in figure 21 and is the version of value assignments we have usedin all our calculations.Note that in figure 22 all parallel lines, regardless of the distances sepa-rating them, reduce to zero. Thus, while the operations discussed so farhave allowed quantification of skew direction, proportional ratios of thewave's parts, and the degree of departure from the parallel state, they havenot provided a quantified account of the fluctuating distances between thetwo parameters of the wave. The procedure for obtaining these values issimilar to, but distinct from, the procedures outlined above.Figure 23 shows the seven types of divergence, congruence, and overlapthat points in the simple wave may display. The two possible assignmentsof positive and negative numbers are shown to the right and left sides infile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (176 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmfigure 23. We have chosen to use the right-hand schema to preserve theintuition that overlap tends to carry a situation toward the zero staterather than away from it. Figure 24 shows the values this series of point as-signments generates when applied to the simple wave. In figure 25 the val-uation for skew, parallelism, and relative proportion have been combinedin the manner discussed above. The 384 positions and their correspondingvalues are the quantification of the trileveled wave of figure 19. Thesesame values are graphed as a single line graph in figure 26. Figure 25,which is the data base of figure 26, is the primary valuation scheme forany complex wave, and the process of quantifying a given time in themodular hierarchy of complex waves will necessarily begin with referenceto the values of figure 25.Figure 26 graphs composite values for a single complex wave. Thesevalues are displayed in figure 25. Figure 26 reduces the complex, trileveled,bidirectionally flowing complex wave of figure 19 to a single line movingin only one direction. Figure 26 preserves certain qualities of the complexwave (fig. 19): its divergence from the zero state where lines are parallel,the direction and degree of skew of pairs of lines, the relative proportionsof the three levels, and the distances between the fluctuating parameters ofthe various component waves. Figure 26 does not reflect the shift of valuesthat would occur if the single-line complex wave were nested into a partic-file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (177 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htm file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (178 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (179 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htm ular position in a modular hierarchy of complex waves, each level ofwhich was sixty-four times larger than its predecessor. In such a case, fig-ure 26 would serve as a schema of values to be combined through super-imposition with the values associated with whichever one of the sixty-foursegments of the next largest level it is to be nested in. These latter valueshave first been multiplied by sixty-four, indicating their membership inthe next larger level in the hierarchy. Thus, sixty-four variants of figure 26would be generated, and it is these variant waves that we have treated asthe temporal maps of a given historical span. The mathematical details ofthe nesting of one level of the hierarchy in another have been imple-mented in the Timewave Zero software. Peter Meyer has contributed amathematical formulation of the theory in the Appendix, pp. 211-220.The components of the valuation of each of the 384 positions in figure 19are shown in figure 25. The values displayed in figure 25 are the basis ofthe quantified maps of temporal flux upon which rests this notion of afractal and hierarchical structure of time. Note that the order of the valuesin figure 25 are the reverse of the order of the values as plotted in figure 26.The last three of the 384 segments of the wave on any level possess sin-gularities that quantify as zero (fig. 26, lower right corner). When thewave on a given level enters those segments of itself that are zero states, itceases to contribute boundary constraints to its subsets on lower levels.The cessation of boundary constraints imposed by higher levels in the hi-erarchy causes a quantized drop toward the zero state each time that afile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (180 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmcycle enters its terminal phase on any level in the hierarchy. Such quan-tized transitions from one modality to another are called changes ofepochs by Whitehead. The appearance of life in an inorganic world, ofconsciousness in an unconscious world, or of language in a world withoutlanguage are all examples of such epochal transitions. Our lives are filledwith such transitions, but they are terminations of relatively short cyclesin the quantified hierarchy. Terminations of cycles or epochs of really longduration cause extreme accelerations toward the zero state. This idea issimilar to Whitehead's conception of concrescence and the Vedic concep-tion of world ages that grow shorter as they tighten around an axis point.The spiral image of the Christian Apocalypse is another example of thisintuition that time is a series of tightening cycles around a quantizedtransformation (cf. Cohn 1970).A perfect, self-consistent proof that figure 26 does adequately conservefour qualities—divergence from the zero state where lines are parallel, thedirection and the degree of skew of pairs of lines, distances between theparameters of the component waves, and the proportions of these threefile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (181 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htm file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (182 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (183 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htm file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (184 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htm file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (185 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htm qualities relative to other levels—is afforded by comparing any two graphsegments assigned to a single time but on different scales relative to an ar-bitrary termination date that is the same for both. Any two such segmentswill be found to be similar in form yet preserving their relative propor-tions.

Figure 26 is a quantification of operational constructs, which makesthis modular hierarchy of temporal variables a valid subject for rigorousscientific investigation.Chapter 11The Temporal Hierarchy and CosmologyConcrescence is Whitehead's term for the process that is any given actualentity:Concrescence is the growing together of the many into the unityof a one . . . The initial phase of a concrescence is composed ofthe separate feelings of the disjunctively diverse entities that makeup the actual world of the actual entity in question. Subsequentphases effect the growing together, the concrescence, of these manyseparate feelings into one unity of feeling, which is termed the sat-isfaction of that actual entity. 'Concrescence' is the name for theprocess in which the universe of many things acquires an individ-ual unity in a determinate relegation of each item of the 'many toits subordination in the constitution of the novel 'one' (PR 321).With the attaining of its satisfaction an actual entity is completedand perishes—i.e., it becomes a datum for fresh instances of con-crescence. (Sherburne 1966, pp. 212-213)The modular wave-hierarchy is described by an energy map of changesrunning forward and backward upon themselves, much like an alternatingcurrent (cf. fig. 19). Fung Yu-Lan (1947) has made clear the traditionalplace this idea has long occupied in Chinese thought:The content of the course of transformation in the universe isa process of construction-plus-destruction in things. And thisprocess of construction-plus-destruction in things is the openingand shutting referred to in the explanations of the Ch'ien andthe K'un. The constructive part of the process is equivalent tothe coming forward, the destructive part is equivalent to thegoing away. A whole act of coming forward, plus a whole actof going away, that is transformation. This going and coming hasno end to it, and just because this is so, therefore the universe isfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (187 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmwithout limit of time. Therefore it is said, the unceasing movingone way and the other is designated as effective evolving. Theprocess is without limit, because what comes must go and whatgoes must come back again: The advancing thing also retires andthe retiring thing comes back again. (p. 98)We are attempting to make mathematically explicit a description of theTao that is no different from that proposed by the third-century Chinesethinker Wang Pi:What he [Wang Pi] was trying to describe was perhaps a series offields of force (as we might call them), contained in, but sub-sidiary to, the main field of force of the Tao, and each manifestingitself at different points in space and time. He believed that toeach of these there corresponded one of the hexagrams of the /Ching, its sufficient characterization being given in the thuan orexplanation attached to it in the Book of Changes. In this wayman could know the most important dominant factors or rootcauses of things, and feel able to affirm with unshakable faiththat though there was manifold complexity in the universe, therewas no confusion. (Needham 1954, vol. 1, p. 322)In the West, the idea of the universe as arising from the ceaseless ebband flow of an underlying medium may be traced to Pythagoras and Her-aclitus. Whitehead's organismic philosophy makes the same assumption:... we shall conceive each primordial element as a vibratory ebb andflow of an underlying energy, or activity (1967, p. 35). Whitehead hasnicely anticipated our turning to science for a judgment on the truth ofthis view:We must first ask whether there is any evidence to associate thequantum theory with vibration. This question is immediatelyanswered in the affirmative. The whole theory centres roundthe radiant energy from an atom, and is intimately associatedwith the periods of the radiant wave-systems. It seems, therefore,that the full hypothesis of essential vibratory existence is themost hopeful way of explaining the paradox of the discontinuousorbit. (1967, p. 36)Like an electron or an organism, a spiral galaxy suggests itself as an ex-file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (188 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmpression on one level of the partially achieved state of concrescence. Theconcrescence that our own small planet, a subunit in the hierarchy fromelectron to galaxy, is now experiencing is of enormous importance to us asa species, yet there is no certain fate to which we can entrust ourselves. Theself-evidence of the fact of freedom and its logical necessity for meaningfulthought means that no phenomenon functions with absolute mechanicalcertainty. This is the fact, at once sobering and exhilarating, that quantumphysics has secured. It may be that the fate of evolution on earth, with itsescape, or no, from catastrophe, is of no concern to the larger universe,much in the way that the death of millions of cells occurs in higher organ-isms as a normal part of metabolism. This supremely rational idea findsstrong support in the existential myth, which Hans Jonas elaborates inhis essay on immortality. Our hypothesis is as rigorous and mathematicalas we can make it, yet all science springs from some myth; and Jonas(1966) speaks eloquently of a myth that our own notion shares:In the beginning, for unknowable reasons, the ground of being,or the Divine, chose to give itself over to the chance and risk andendless variety of becoming. And wholly so; entering into theadventure of space and time, the deity held back nothing of itself;no uncommitted or unimpaired part remained to direct, correct,and ultimately guarantee the devious working-out of its destiny increation. On this unconditional immanence the modern temperinsists. It is its courage or despair, in any case its bitter honesty, totake our being-in-the-world seriously: to view the world as leftto itself, its laws as brooking no interference, and the rigor of ourbelonging to it as not softened by extramundane providence. Thesame our myth postulates for God's being in the world. Not, how-ever, in the sense of pantheistic immanence; if the world and Godare simply the same, the world at each moment and in each staterepresents his fullness, and God can neither lose nor gain. Rather,in order that the world might be, and be for itself, God renouncedhis own being, divesting himself of his deity—to receive it backfrom the Odyssey of time weighted with the chance harvest ofunforeseeable temporal experience; transfigured or possibly evendisfigured by it. In such self-forfeiture of divine integrity for thesake of unprejudiced becoming, no other foreknowledge canbe admitted than that at possibilities which cosmic being offers inits own terms: to these, God committed his cause in effacing him-file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (189 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmself for the world.And for aeons his cause is safe in the slow hands of cosmicchance and probability—while all the time we may surmise apatient memory of the gyrations of matter to accumulate into anever more expectant accompaniment of eternity to the laborsof time—a hesitant emergence of transcendence from the opaque-ness of immanence.. . . And then he trembles as the thrust of evolution, carried byits own momentum, passes the threshold where innocence ceasesand an entirely new criterion of success and failure takes hold ofthe divine stake. The advent of man means the advent of knowl-edge and freedom, and with this supremely double-edged gift theinnocence of the mere subject of self-fulfilling life has given wayto the charge of responsibility under the disjunction of goodand evil. To the promise and risk of this agency the divine cause,revealed at last, henceforth finds itself committed; and its issuetrembles in the balance. The image of God, haltingly begun bythe universe, for so long worked upon—and left undecided—in the wide and then narrowing spirals of pre-human time, passeswith this last twist, and with a dramatic quickening of the move-ment, into man's precarious trust, to be completed, saved, orspoiled by what he will do to himself and the world. And in thisawesome impact of his deeds on God's destiny, on the very com-plexion of eternal being, lies the immortality of man.With the appearance of man, transcendence awakened to itselfand henceforth accompanies his doings with the bated breath ofsuspense, hoping and beckoning, rejoicing and grieving, approv-ing and frowning—and, I daresay, making itself felt to him evenwhile not intervening in the dynamics of his worldly scene: forcan it not be that by the reflection of its own state as it waverswith the record of man, the transcendent casts light and shadowover the human landscape? (pp. 275-277)If the wave model is a valid general theory of time, it should be possibleto show why certain periods or places have been particularly rich in eventsthat accelerate the creative advance into novelty, and also to show whereand when in the future such events might be expected to recur.file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (190 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmTo carry out this operation, a personal computer has proven indispens-able. A group of programs implementing these ideas has been written byour colleague Peter Meyer. We call this program Timewave Zero.* Thissoftware takes these theories and discoveries concerning the / Ching andcreates time maps based upon them. These time maps or novelty mapsshow the ebb and flow of connectedness or novelty in any span of timefrom a few days to tens of millennia. The theory is not deterministic; it[* Timewave Zero is available in the Mac or MS/DOS environment from Dolphin Software, 48 Shat-tuck Square #147, Berkeley, California 94704.]does not say what will happen in the future, only the levels of novelty thatwhatever happens will have to fulfill. As such it operates as a map, or sim-plified picture, of the future (and past) behavior of whatever system isbeing studied. At this point perhaps a picture is worth more than words,so let us look therefore at figure 27 on page 172.This is a novelty map of the eight thousand years that immediately pre-cede the end of the Mayan Calendar on December 22, a.d. 2012. First letme explain that we chose the end of the Mayan Calendar as the end date for this graph because we found good agreement between the events thatcomprise the historical record and the wave itself when this end date waschosen. The end date is the point of maximized novelty in the wave and isthe only point in the entire wave that has a quantified value of zero. Wearrived at this particular end date without knowledge of the Mayan Cal-endar, and it was only after we noticed that the historical data seemed tofit best with the wave if this end date was chosen that we were informedthat the end date that we had deduced was in fact the end of the MayanCalendar.In figure 27, and indeed in all the novelty maps, when the graph linemoves downward, novelty is assumed to be increasing. When there ismovement away from the base line, novelty is assumed to be decreasing infavor of habitual forms of activity. Time is seen as the ebb and flow of twoopposed qualities: novelty versus habit, or density of connectedness versusdisorder. In figure 27 we see clearly that one trend toward greater noveltyreached its culmination around 2700 B.C., precisely at the height of theOld Kingdom pyramid-building phase; then a countermovement towardfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (191 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmpredictable forms of behavior asserted itself and increased in importanceuntil around 900 B.C. At that time, around the time of the consolidationof Mycenaean sea power, the tendency toward habituation was overcomeand replaced by a long cascade into greater and greater novelty that reachesits culmination early in the twenty-first century.The career of novelty is revealed to be a process that is punctuated bysubprocesses. These mitigate, modify, and influence an overall general ten-dency toward greater and greater novelty. Notice that the last fifteen hun-dred years of figure 27 are highly novel times that have played themselvesout at levels of novelty very close to the horizontal axis, the maximizedzero state. Let us look at those last fifteen hundred years more closely.Figure 28 is a graph full of precise predictions that to my mind demon-strate the force of Timewave Zero. The thing to notice is the very preciseway in which episodes of historical advance or novelty are precisely indi-cated by steep descents in the wave. Such agreement between the historicalfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (192 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmFIGURE 278012 years, from 6000 B.C. to a.d. 2012. In figures 27 through 30 the values onthe left of each graph are a numerical quantification of novelty. The maximumnovel situation has a value of zero; hence, values tend toward zero as the enddate is approached. In these graphs the end date is assumed to be December 21, A.D. 2012.record and the ebb and flow of the wave argues strongly that the Timewaveis in fact able to accurately portray the evolution of historical patterns ofchange.The theory of time that is implied by the Timewave is a theory of timeas a fractal, or self-similar, wave. Fractals have recently come into vogue inmany branches of the natural sciences, and the reader wishing a thoroughexposition of this new area of mathematics should consult Benoit Man-delbrot's The Fractal Geometry of Nature. A fractal wave comes quite natu-rally equipped with an extensive set of internal resonances that show aformal, but acausal, linkage between events and periods of time that maybe widely separated from each other in space and time. So, for example,when we look at events of the one hundred years leading up to the Mayancalendrical termination, we see that the graph is topologically similar tothe graph that we said applied to the past several thousand years. My in-terpretation of this is that it means that shorter duration subsets of thefile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (193 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmFIGURE 281512 years, from a.d. 500 to a.d. 2012.

Such an idea lays the basis for understanding such phe-nomena as fads, fashion, and the occasional wave of historical obsessionthat characterize society; for example, see figure 29.Notice that with figure 29 we leave the realm of modeling of past his-torical events and move into the area of prophecy proper, for a portion offigure 29 actually refers to a portion of time that has yet to undergo theformality of actually occurring. Let us zero in on the point in which thewave passes out of the past and into the future (fig. 30).Here we see twenty years, with December 19, 1989, in the middle.

Thisfinal time revolutionizes the course of the world.The irruption of a time that is impossible, of an event that fallsout of the cycle—we are familiar with this notion, from the fishesthat remain hanging on the limbs of the trees in the Deucalion,to the mountain that is transplanted into the sea in the sermon ofJesus. (Van Der Leeuw, in Campbell 1967, pp. 338, 340)Gnostic intuitions of the first and second century suggested that energyis the divine light that is trapped in matter and that energy, in order tofree itself, must evolve itself through progressively subtler stages until itgenerates self-reflecting consciousness, which can then evolve techniquesfor freeing all energy from matter. Like this myth, all ideas of salvation, en-lightenment, or Utopia may be taken to be expressions in consciousness ofthe drive of energy to free itself from the limitations of three-dimensionalspace and return to the Father, that is, return to the uncontaminatedessence of itself in an epoch of realized concrescent satisfaction. Concres-cent satisfaction includes the notion of energy unbounded by space ortime. This means for our theory that at especially low-value regions of themodular wave-hierarchy a quantum jump should occur in the concrescentprocess.What this advance of novelty is, and what the process of becoming maybe seen to be in essence, is the revelation of the interspecies' mind. Inhuman beings, it is approached through the nonmetabolizing neuralDNA scattered through the body, and for humans it becomes apparent asa higher cortical phenomenon, an experience, as a confrontation with theJungian collective unconscious. This revelation and its integration intothe field of shared experience is a process of transformation of the previ-ously limited ego. The many magnitudes of duration in which the levelsof the modular hierarchy of waves can be supposed to be operable exceed,at both ends of the scale, any physical processes known to occur in theuniverse. These magnitudes or cosmic epochs are shown in figure 20,Table III. For example, the time during which 1/2 of the hydrogen is con-sumed in the thermonuclear reaction H2 + H2 — He + n is approximately.00003 second, that is, of the same magnitude as the .000048 figure forthe thirteenth cycle projected in the wave model. Similarly, the age ofmatter in the universe is now tentatively placed at 1.5 X 10[to the 10th power] years; ourfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (199 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmfinal figure on the macroscale is nearly five times larger than this, but wesuggest that the first nearly 3 X 10[to the 10th power] (30 billion) years were simply passedwith diffuse primal hydrogen (and perhaps antihydrogen) entering thespace-time continuum very gradually. In any case, some 15 billion yearsago, matter began to gather in sufficiently dense aggregates to give rise tothe temperatures, pressures, and magnetic fields necessary for star forma-tion. In the light of these time scales and events, the cosmogonic myth ar-gued for becomes the following.Nearly 36 billion years ago, almost twice as long as the age that modernastrophysics supposes to be the age of the universe, the set of mutually reflec-tive relations that constitute the paired universe of matter and antimatterbegan to enter and, thereby, define three-dimensional space. Following amajor shift of epochs, hydrogen began to appear spontaneously near the cen-ter of the spatial topology. Denser atomic materials followed in due course;first helium, via the Critchfield formula for H-H fusion, which can proceedin pure hydrogen. All of these material entities spring at their point of originfrom the same source as the topological manifold of space, that is, from ahigher spatial dimension. Why a higher spatial dimension is ingressing at anever-accelerating rate into space-time we shall perhaps not understand untilwe achieve, through a concrescence of time, a return to the higher topologi-cal dimension. We in this case means the interspecies' network of DNAshared by all life. As in Jonas's myth, deity thus achieves a redefining andclarifying of the nature of itself through the efficacy of its works. Whateverthe reasons energy entered space-time, each expression of itself in time hastaken the form of a further sophistication of organization. The path of re-turn sought by evolution on all levels is through antientropic organization.The original particles, which began entering the space-time continuumsome 36 billion years ago, had, by 12 billion years ago, given rise to the epochof the primal aggregate of the Big Bang theory, although the great majorityof stars are less than 5 billion years old. This wave-hierarchy theory of timemanages to avoid some of the dualisms inherent in the Steady State of BigBang schools of cosmological theory, since it offers a mechanism by whichan entire universe can spring into existence and yet not violate any physicallaws while doing so. In its general outlines, the cosmology that our theoryhas built into it is in accord with recent ideas put forth by Edward Tryon.Both his model and ours predict a universe that is homogeneous, isotropic,and closed and consists equally of matter and antimatter. All of these con-tentions are consistent with, and supported by, the present state of astro-file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (200 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmphysics. We have proposed that quantum-mechanical phenomena organizematter at every level; Tryon (1973) suggests that the universe itself is a verylarge instance of a quantum-mechanical phenomenon that is a common-place when of brief duration. Tryon points out that universes can springfrom nothing without violations of physical law so long as they have specificproperties. Chief among these is the requirement that such a universe musthave a zero net value for all conserved quantities. The quantities that physicsconsiders conserved fall into two categories, continuous and discrete. It is thediscrete quantities that characterize the elementary particles: spin, strange-ness, electric charge, and so on. These quantities have equal magnitude, butopposed signs, in the case of particles and antiparticles. All that die laws ofdiscrete conservation imply, therefore, is that if a universe appears fromnowhere, it must consist equally of matter and antimatter. It is very possiblethat we live in a universe that possesses zero net values for all of its conservedquantities. Such a universe could well have sprung from nothing:To indicate how such a creation might have come about, I referto quantum field theory, in which every phenomenon that couldhappen in principle actually does happen occasionally inpractice, on a statistically random basis. For example, quantumfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (201 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmThe universe is subject to cycles of temporal variables, occurring onmany levels and generating appropriate forms of novelty on each suchlevel. Life's epoch began one to two billion years ago—1.3 billion years onour scale. Eighteen million years ago brings one to the closure of the nextsmallest level. This occurred at the height of the age of mammals. Onesixty-fourth of this 18-million-year cycle is a cycle whose inception was275,000 years ago, a time that corresponds well with the emergence ofHomo sapiens. One sixty-fourth of this cycle brings us to the cycle thatepitomizes what might properly be called historical time, that cycle whichbegan 4,300-plus years ago, around 2300 B.C. The duration of the cyclenext encountered is 67-plus years, and we have assumed the most recentsuch epoch to have begun in 1945. The end of World War II and the de-velopment of atomic weapons and their use in war are forms of noveltywhose appearance attended the shift of epochs that created the postmod-ern world. If our understanding is correct, then this same 67-plus—yearfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (202 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmcycle at, or near, the end of a 4,300-year cycle will terminate around theyear 2012 (cf. fig. 27).Language and its appearance is a recent instance of concrescence. It is a re-cent form of novelty, having been in existence not more than a millionyears. As a concrescence occurring in our species, it may provide a clue tothe path that evolving human novelty will take in the future. In the case oflanguage elaboration, we have an excellent example of the way in whichwhat must first have been a freakish mutational ability became overnight aspecies-transforming novelty, emerging from the foundation of mam-malian organization. We suggest that the unique mode of being that lan-guage represents may have become manifest as follows.Human beings must have discovered the use of fire shortly after acquir-ing prehensile thumbs. Certainly evidence argues that humans possessedfire long before the first tools were made. Once the discovery of fire wasmade, the element necessary for humanity's correct intervention in en-ergy's struggle to free itself was present. With the introduction of fire intothe Homo sapiens community, the stage was set for the invocation of thelogos. Around their fires, humans dragged the carcasses of the hunt andthe plants that the group deemed useful as food or fuel. It is reasonable tosuggest that in this coincidence of plants, bone tubes emptied of theirmarrow, fire, and the restless prehensile hands of early humans, eventuallythe peculiar psychological states attendant upon the smoking of trypta-mines, or the MAO inhibitors occurring in the same biosynthetic chain,would be discovered. In describing Australopithecus, a human ancestor,Lord Ritchie-Calder (1961) says, They lived in limestone caves and thereis evidence they may have used fire . . . they appear to have been carnivo-rous, because in the caves there are animal bones . . . and antelope limbbones. These antelope bones are interesting because they have beensmashed to extract the marrow (p. 43). Recent excavations at Non NokTha in Thailand indicate that one of the most technologically advancedcultures in the world of 13,000 B.C. existed there. The graves at Non NokTha yielded the bones of Bos indicus, the Indian zebu. The manure of thisspecies of cattle is the preferred environment of Colombian varieties ofStropharia cubensis mushrooms.Once any hallucinogenic effect were discovered, it would, as it repre-sents contact with a tremendum, be surrounded with ritual. This usuallyfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (203 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmmeans dancing and, especially important for our argument, singing andchanting. Once ritual use of a tryptamine-containing plant is exercised inthe presence of vocal sound, the chemical basis for spontaneous seizures ofunconsciously modulated sound and its signification of a tremendumwould be present. The beginning of language may be such glossalialikephenomena. Shortly after such practice found even slight usage, onecould expect that the correct union of signed sound and cognitive cate-gory would occur, and language, as the prototype of a more perfect ar-chetypal logos, would be discovered—discovered within the confines ofritual, a kind of preconscious understanding of the requirements of energyfor its transformation and liberation. Following the acquisition of lan-guage, the advance into novelty, now in part self-reflecting, continued ona higher level. The most recent of these major new levels of coordinatedorganization may be embodied in the epoch of electronic communica-tions and the furiously evolving postrelativistic consciousness of the twen-tieth century.Language is the embodiment of meaning. Meaning signifies organiza-tion, and there is no organization without purpose. What is the purposeof organization? Is it perhaps to retard entropy? In such a case, the mean-ing of meaning for that which apprehends meaning is the necessity topurposefully create and maintain order. Note retard , not reverse ; ac-cording to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, entropy cannot be re-versed; in localized areas, however, it may cease temporarily. In organismsthis situation occurs, and it also occurs in low-temperature systems thatmutate to states of higher order instead of going over into disorder.Transference of the properties of microevents occurring in quantum-mechanical systems to macrosystems, a phenomenon exhibited by super-fluids, might, if found to have a wider occurrence in nature, offer someexplanation for the emergence of natural levels of order. Research has al-ready shown that in some biological processes microphysical events aredecisive (cf. Prigogine et al. 1972).Chapter 12Toward a Physics of ConcrescenceThe story of the evolution of physics in the twentieth century is the storyof the elaboration and acceptance of a wave-mechanical conception of theprimary nature of matter. No model of matter can fail to take into ac-file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (204 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmcount that contemporary physics has recaptured a Pythagorean intuitiontoo long forgotten by the followers of the commonsense physics of New-ton. Common sense is gone from physics; Planck banished it when he dis-covered the discrete nature of radiation, and Heisenberg's Principle ofUncertainty made a return to the notion of simple location forever impos-sible. Our own theory is thoroughly kymatic, or wavelike.The parallels between the classic behavior of waves and the graphs wehave elaborated is interesting because they seem to argue strongly thatthere is no inconsistency involved in discussing the modular hierarchy wepropose in wave-mechanical terms. One model of wave activity that hasfound acceptance in quantum mechanics is that of French physicist PrinceLouis de Broglie. The accepted understanding of de Broglie's wave is thatthe highest intensity of these waves at any point of the space to whichthey are confined gives us the probability of finding the electron at thatparticular point if we carry out a special experiment designed for that pur-pose. They are so to speak 'waves of probability' (Gamow 1964, p. 57). Itis interesting that the modular hierarchy of the / Ching also is a wave ofprobability, and that if the electron is conceived of as a concrescence,then, naturally, at the point of maximum symmetry (the zero state) of thewave, one might expect its appearance. Such a theory would have clear ap-plication to atomic physics if the various quantum states met within theatom could be shown to be determined by zero, or near zero, states (max-imum symmetries) within the short epochs of the / Ching hierarchy. The /Ching wave and the postquantum atom may not really possess distinctparticularity. The property of the / Ching wave-hierarchy, determinationof morphology through ingression of temporal variables, may simply rep-resent a description of a set of laws operating within the atom but previ-ously ignored. Modern physics is haunted by a plentitude of particles; anelegant theory should reduce such particles to a coherent substratum.In The Ambidextrous Universe, Gardner (1964) observes:The positron was the first anti-particle to be discovered. Everyelementary particle is now known to have a correspondinganti-particle. The two particles are alike in all respects except thatthey are opposite in the sign of any quantity (represented by a plusor minus quantum number) that is conserved ... In other wordsall conserved quantities must be of opposite sign so that when thefile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (205 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmparticle and anti-particle come together, these quantities will can-cel each other, leaving nothing but pure energy (photons). In thecase of the photon and the neutral pi-meson, particle and anti-particle are one and the same. (p. 211)He speaks of . . . entertaining examples of mutual annihilation by aleft-right encounter. In most cases the two structures involved are helicesof opposite handedness (Gardner 1964, p. 250). In this vein we refer toC. H. Hinton's (1887) speculation:If we consider a twist and its image, they are but the simplestand most rudimentary type of organism. What holds good ofa twist and its image twist would hold good of a more compli-cated arrangement also. If a bit of structure apparently very unlikea twist, and with manifold parts and differences in it—if such astructure were to meet its image structure, each of them wouldinstantly unwind the other, and what was before a complex andcompound whole, opposite to an image of itself, would at once beresolved into a string of formless particles. A flash, a blaze, and allwould be over. (p. 172)We have speculated that the vacuum fluctuation of space-time is aholographic modular hierarchy whose individual levels possess propertiesin common with the King Wen sequence of the / Ching and the morphol-ogy of DNA. We have suggested that within this hierarchy time could,though hologramatically homogenized, be said to be moving in two op-posed directions. Hinton and others, in trying to imagine a hypotheticalmeeting between human and antihuman, or galaxy and antigalaxy, alwaysconceive the meeting as occurring in normal, three-dimensional space,and thus necessarily entailing a point of first contact and an approach orclosure of linear distance in three dimensions. This sort of meeting ofmatter and antimatter can only result in a violent, complete, and spatiallylocalized energy conversion, which is not particularly interesting. We cansuppose that in such a case the Leidenfrost phenomenon would act to in-hibit the reaction. This phenomenon is named after the German physi-cian who studied it during the nineteenth century. As a drop on a hotsurface evaporates, a layer of steam forms between the drop and the sur-face; this insulates the drop and appreciably slows its evaporation. Theanalogy between this phenomenon and events likely to follow upon afile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (206 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmmeeting of matter and antimatter has already been suggested by HansAlfven (1966):The first contact between koinomatter and antimatter will resultin annihilation, but the attendant generation of energy will createa force that separates the two. In the Leidenfrost phenomenon... a layer of steam is formed between the drop and the plate. Inour more ambitious experiment, a layer is similarly formed to sep-arate the koinomatter and antimatter. Reasoning by analogy, wemay expect this to bring about an annihilation that is relativelyslow and small in scale. It need not be more intensive than toensure the formation and maintenance of an adequate insulatinglayer. (p. 52)If, however, instead of a three-dimensional approach of an object and itsantimatter reflection, we imagine that these two universes were never spa-tially distinct, but rather were somehow coextensive in space-time (one oc-cupying a higher spatial dimension than the other), each the antimatterimage of the other, and each existing in holographic matrices that conferspatiotemporal ubiquity to all of the contents of each, then it is possible toimagine a meeting between universe and antiuniverse, which would have amuch more profound effect than simple annihilation. Such a meetingcould only occur across the complete topology of the entire space-timecontinuum (or across the topology of an astronomical macrostructure, likea galaxy, if the topology of space-time is discontinuous over extragalactic,or extraclustral, distances). The meeting of a material matrix possessinghologramatic properties and its antimatter reflection would result, it istrue, in mutual annihilation of both matrices, but not in the sort of local-ized explosion that would ensue from their meeting in three dimensions.Rather, the annihilation through mutual cancellation would occur at everypoint in both matrices simultaneously, something impossible in a three-dimensional collision, where Leidenfrost's effect would impede the reac-tion. The meeting of antimatter and its reflection in normal space seemsunlikely, since both kinds of matter, the particles to build such matter atany rate, have already been detected right here on earth. Were a collisionin normal space to occur between two universes, one of matter and one ofantimatter, the reaction (since it would represent a total energy conversion)would possess, as the surface of its expanding spherical shock wave, fusionprocesses that would accomplish the initial plasmization of matter caughtfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (207 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:06 AM"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmin the expanding reaction; the partial energy release, represented by the fu-sion processes, would itself be converted in the matter/antimatter reactionmoving behind it. The matter/antimatter interphase would occur in a plas-mic atmosphere of free ions; matter in modes of organization that occuroutside the fission process would not be generated by the expanding totalenergy conversion reaction.A very different situation would occur were the collision of the two con-tinua to occur in the hologramatic kind of spatiotemporal organization weare suggesting may exist. In such a situation, the mutual annihilation ofboth continua would occur simultaneously at all points in both matrices.Only photons would be left, and they would presumably retain the struc-ture they had possessed as matter, and its stereoisomeric reflection in anti-matter. This idea of an event occurring simultaneously throughout thefour-dimensional space-time continuum is at variance with the assumptionsof relativity. Nevertheless, Whitehead (1967) preserves this concept in hisphilosophy, and following him, we have preserved it in our methodology:It only remains to add that Einstein would probably reject thetheory of multiple space-time systems which I have been ex-pounding to you. He would interpret his formula in terms ofcontortions in space-time which alter the invariance theory formeasure properties, and of the proper times of each historicalroute. His mode of statement has the greater mathematical sim-plicity, and only allows of one law of gravitation, excluding thealternative. But, for myself, I cannot reconcile it with the givenfacts of our experience as to simultaneity, and spatial arrangement.There are also other difficulties of a more abstract character.(p. 122)It is possible to suggest that relativistic effects are operating within eachwave-particle conceived as a four-dimensional space-time continuum, butthat the equations of relativity should be inserted within those equations,descriptive of the properties of holographic matrices: convolutional inte-grals and Fourier transformations.In trying to imagine this meeting of universes, we should abandon theidea of a localized explosion and imagine, instead, a universe whose phys-ical laws suddenly cease to operate—as matter and antimatter achieve si-multaneous, ubiquitous cancellation—leaving, in the wake of the closurefile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (208 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:06 AM"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmof the vacuum fluctuation, the photonic forms existing and able for thefirst time to obey laws relevant to themselves as photonic holograms(forms), rather than as photonic holograms expressed through matter orantimatter, as objects or antiobjects. Such a process, though farfetched,would utilize a set of naturally occurring phenomena (vacuum fluctua-tions and higher dimensional matrices) to create the sort of basic ontolog-ical mutation in the nature of matter such as, we suggest, may characterizesome future shift of epochs. The photonic shell, left in the wake of fourth-dimensional merging of holograms of matter, and of antimatter, may bethe key to a clearer understanding of the archetype of a paradisiacal exis-tence at time's end. The spiral implosion of time may entail the universe,and every entity in it, meeting and canceling its antimatter double to cre-ate, through this union of opposites, an ontological mutation from matterto photonic form, which represents tremendous freedom.Myth anticipates these ideas in the Mandaean conception of the soul asa light double, which exists in a higher dimension, and which one meetsafter death (cf. Drower 1962). If such a meeting between our universe andits reflection could be imagined to be possible in some not-so-distant fu-ture, relative to the age of the universe, then the existence of life and self-reflecting consciousness could be seen as emergent properties that are anatural consequence of the temporal flow of a universe that has entered theshort epochs that precede a final concrescence. We see the experiment atLa Chorrera as part of a tapping in on a growing sense of the imminence ofa major shift of epochs on some level that must be stirring in many speciesand individuals. In our experiment, an intuition of such a possible changewas achieved through techniques bioelectronic and shamanic, whose reve-lation, through a transpersonal zeitgeist-like phenomenon, marks a form ofelection. If the theory of the bonding of harmine into nucleic acids (briefly,while metabolizing, or permanently, through audilely induced bonds) iscorrect, and if the resulting signal or shift in metabolic mode were to befound to effect and restructure higher cortical processes, we would be onthe way to validating intimations that an epoch-terminating event, long inthe making and critical to the creative continuation of human evolution, isat last coming to fruition. The investigations at La Chorrera then emergeas fortuitous events made possible by a correct use of free will in the lightof the constraints inherent in the present epoch.Certainly, if a partial concrescence is achieved in a three-dimensionalfocus, then the temporal continuum of normal space-time will be unaf-fected and continue. Any partial concrescence would leave intact a contin-uum of successive events, and as investigators of this phenomenon, it is upfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (209 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:06 AM"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmto us to anticipate these successive events. Although each time is an over-tonal harmonic of other moments, there is a thread of creative advancerunning through time along the helix of closure represented by life's ap-proach to new epochs. The quantified hierarchy (cf. figs. 27 through 30 inchap. 11 and fig. 32 in the Epilogue) appears to describe the vicissitudes ofpast history with some accuracy, but the same description gives such a piv-otal role to the twentieth century that reason dictates skepticism. The crit-ical role of our own era is a fact only if the assumption of the cyclical,ever-condensing nature of time is correct. If time is an eternal process, thenit may be open-ended or cyclical, but not the latter in such a way as to everyield the actual concrescence this idea calls for. That could happen only ifthe temporal cycles were to constantly shorten themselves around a tempo-ral axis. The idea of an axis time is common to Continental theology:We write: Anno Domini 1951. This means that we measure timefrom a centre. This centre determines the time that follows it, andthe time which preceded it strove toward this centre. Our histori-cal numbering of the years tacitly presupposes a caesura betweenthe era before the birth of Christ and the era which came after it.Our history is oriented toward a centre. (Quispel, in Campbell1967, p. 85)Such a leading of energy toward a center can only end in transforma-tion. What the temporal axis is like, as an experience, has been the contin-uing puzzle of our experiment and of much of human history:Of final time itself we see nothing. There is only God . . . Hereall dimensions are effaced, including the fourth dimension, oftime. But the biblical concept of eternity is no abstract timeless-ness, no aeternitas, but a me olam ad olam. Final time begins in themidst of historical time. In the New Testament as elsewhere it isannounced to the peoples by omens—adunata and wonders. Butit also sets its stamp upon time. In the ancient world, includingEgypt, there was an eschatological schema, according to whicha time of decline and despair heralded the advent of final time.The historical events were read into this schema, as converselythe event that seceded from time was read into history. (Van DerLeeuw, in Campbell 1967, pp. 348-349)file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (210 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:06 AM"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmThe moment of concrescence may occupy the same position withrespect to time that a magnetic pole of the earth occupies relative to thegeomagnetic field of the planet. Like the poles, which are physically char-acterized by climatological extreme, the temporal pole would mark a tem-poral extreme, the most extreme moment of density of the ingression ofnovelty, but like the poles, it would not be apparently different from itsspace-time environment. Such an understanding of time would mean nodefinitive concrescence could take place.Our theory is one of a progressive spiral involution of time toward aconcrescence, rather than a theory of a static hierarchy of waves, eternallyexpressed on many levels. This is because the terminal positions in theKing Wen wave naturally quantify as zero states. The natural consequenceof this is that the terminal sections of an epoch do not contribute to thevaluation assigned to lower levels of that particular section of the hierar-chy. This results in a progressive drop of valuations toward the zero stateas any epoch enters its terminal phase. Only in the situation of final con-crescence does the valuation on all levels actually become zero. In fact, thequantified definition of absolute concrescence is that it is the zero point inthe quantified wave-hierarchy.The paradox of the concrescence is that as one approaches it, one be-comes more free, but through recognition of the boundary conditions ofthat modality into which one is becoming absorbed. Once concrescence isachieved, ego and Tao are perceived as one, or rather, only Tao is per-ceived, but as though it were ego.The final phase in the process of concrescence, constituting anactual entity, is one complex, fully determinate feeling. This finalphase is termed satisfaction. It is fully determinate (a) as to itsgenesis, (b) as to its objective character for the transcendent cre-ativity, and (c) as to its prehension—positive or negative— ofevery item in its universe. (Whitehead 1969, pp. 30-31)A persistently recurring idea concerning a sudden apparent suspensionof natural laws is the assumption, which the / Ching also makes, that nat-ural laws are not eternal absolutes, but rather flux phenomena that oper-ate over long periods of time. Though it is commonly assumed thathuman time is cosmically insignificant in terms of duration, actually thisdoes not appear to be the case. Whitehead (1968) notes that . . . span offile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (211 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:06 AM"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmexistence is merely relative to our habits of human life. For inframolecularoccurrence, a second is a vast period of time (p. 157). When a span ofhuman time is compared not only to the varieties of duration persisting inthe macrocosm but to those in the physical microcosm as well, wheremagnitudes like .655 X 10[to the negative 27th power] erg seconds are met with (cf. fig. 20, TableIII, in chap. 10), the position of humanly cognizable time among theclasses of time necessary for the functioning of the physical universe ismore correctly seen to rest in the middle; so that from the standpoint of atemporally deconditioned and impartial observer, the appearance of life inthe last few seconds of a cosmic hour of creation is equally as unlikely as,given the self-evident existence of life, the appearance of consciousness inthe closing seconds of yet another cosmic hour devoted to the career oflife. Each of these acts, with deus ex machina endings, must be seen objec-tively as being no less improbable than that in the closing seconds of anAct III, the curtain might be rung down by a concrescent transformationthat would fulfill the equation life is to nonlife as consciousness is to life asX is to consciousness. One point more: These three propositions are notreally equally improbable. Given the first, the second is more likely; giventhe first and second, the third grows almost necessary.Achievement of the zero state can be imagined to arrive in one of twoforms. One is the dissolution of the cosmos in an actual cessation and un-raveling of natural laws, a literal apocalypse. The other possibility takesless for granted from the mythologems associated with the collectivetransformation and entry into concrescence and hews more closely to theidea that concrescence, however miraculous it is, is still the culmination ofa human process, a process of toolmaking, which comes to completion inthe perfect artifact: the monadic self, exteriorized, condensed, and visiblein three dimensions; in alchemical terms, the dream of a union of spiritand matter. Presumably, were such a hyperspatial tool/process discovered,in a very short time it would entirely restructure life's experience of itself,of time, space, and of otherness, and then it would be these effects whichwould follow rather than precede the concrescence, and which, throughtheir atemporal influence on the content of visionary experience, wouldbe seen to have given rise to the apocalyptic scenario in the expectationof so many ontologies. The appearance in normal space-time of a hyper-dimensional body, obedient to a simultaneously transformed and resur-rected human will, and able to plumb the obligations and opportunitiesinherent in this unique juncture in energy's long struggle for self-liberation, may be apocalypse enough.file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (212 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:06 AM"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmWhat we now require is an empirically verifiable experimental confirma-tion of the idea of a modular wave-hierarchy in time, or of the importanceof nucleic acid ESR for consciousness. The quest for such experiments mayprove elusive for the following reason: The dependence of scientific meth-odology upon inductive thought has caused it to construct its rules of ad-missible evidence against the admission of phenomena that cannot berepeatedly triggered by experimental means. Against this point of view,which assumes the absolute homogeneity of time, our own theory assumesat its very heart that time itself is a medium of variables in flux, and that assuch, every moment is different from every other moment. This is actuallya more consistently conservative position than science's logically un-founded use of induction. Nevertheless, this position holds out the possi-bility that, unless we are able to exactly determine and predict the temporalboundary conditions operating in a given moment, we may not be able todevise an experimental procedure that would effectively prove or disprovethis theory. Elimination of inductive assumptions, and formulation ofclear and quantified definitions of the boundary conditions inherent in thewaveform, is only part of the problem. We must also understand that, evenif the wave theory of time is correct, we would find it difficult, if not im-possible, to prove, unless we had chosen a temporal moment of major con-crescence from which to generate the wave. Only in such rare cases wouldthe wave conform to observed experience on every temporal level of thehierarchy.Even in the case of a major or final concrescence, confirmation wouldnot occur in a 72-billion-year cycle that had these condensing subcyclesoperable until the last four days, or, more probably, until the last severalhours of the cycle. Figure 20, Table III, makes clear why this is so. We sug-gest that each cycle has within itself revelatory intervals where, in gar-bled, or distorted, form, intuitions of the species' history-culminatingentry into concrescence emerges into the conscious collective life of thepsyche to fertilize idea systems in formation there. Such intervals arequantifiable as low-value approaches to an ideal zero state. Figure 32, inthe Epilogue, displays the values of Frame 384. Frame 384 is the terminalframe in the hierarchy of sixty-four-nested cycles, each with 384 variables.As such, it represents the last epoch on any level; it maps the epoch imme-diately preceding concrescence on any level. Does it describe the ingres-sion of novelty into history since 2300 B.C.? We submit not only that itdoes but that Frame 384 also graphs the ingression of novelty into ourown epoch, from 1945 to 2012.file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (213 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:06 AM"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmIt is difficult to imagine a universally pleasing method of comparingtwo distinct historical events against each other and against a quantifiedscale of their respective degrees of advancement into novelty. This beingso, comparison between the 4,306-year scale and the current 67-plus—yearcycle, with resulting judgments concerning the degree to which the twomay complement, and reflect, each other, must rest purely and finally inthe mind of the beholder. If the relation between the 4,306-year cycle andthe 67-plus—year cycle were established, so too would be an idea implicitin this, that the terminal 67-plus—year cycle contains, condensed and in-tensified, all the themes and changes of the 4,306-year cycle. When weturn to the next smaller cycle, the 384-day lunar year, the problem is mademore complicated by the obvious loss of objectivity. Logical extension ofthis idea would indicate that the terminal 6-day cycle should be as much acondensation of the themes of the last 384-day cycle as that cycle is of thelast 67-plus-year cycle, or as that is to the last 4,306-year cycle. Althoughmore than 72 billion years are necessary for the first six quantized transi-tions of level, those remaining, though continuing the same mathematicalprogression, require only 384 days to complete themselves. In other words,half of the becoming of the 72-plus-billion-year-old universe, half of theunfoldment of the hierarchically structured totality of its laws, will occur,given the correctness of these time cycles, during the last .3 seconds of itsexistence. The rise of life, the appearance of civilization, the discovery ofatomic energy, each represents the revelatory interval associated withcrossing one of the quantized barriers to condensation into the nextsmaller cycle; yet in the last 135 minutes, eighteen such barriers will becrossed, thirteen of them in the last 75 X 10[to the -4th power] seconds. Trying to imaginewhat passage through these barriers might be like pushes one's imagina-tion to the limit of hyperbole. The shorter twenty of the progressivelylengthening twenty-four cycles that comprise the entire temporal hierar-chy occur within the last 384-day cycle.The concept of a revelatory interval clarifies the idea that apparent mir-acles, that is, extremely improbable occurrences, are actually instanceswhen the operating laws of one cycle achieve a sort of harmonic cancel-lation with another cycle whose operating laws are more restrictive ofmolecular activity. This understanding of the nature of miracles is thatthey are instances when phenomenological modes common to differenttemporal modalities than the one being experienced break in upon nat-ural laws mistakenly assumed to be eternal constants, disrupting and dis-file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (214 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:06 AM"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmtorting them. This explanation applies equally to miracles of the sortascribed to Christ or Simon Magnus, or to such miracles as the existenceof life in a largely inorganic cosmos or the existence of consciousness in acosmos where such a complex level of organization is apparently rare.Natural laws are not constants, but descriptions of statistical norms thatare valid only when applied within the limits of the specific epoch inwhich they are encountered. This idea aids one trying to visualize the var-ious levels of condensation through which this phenomenon will pass andpresent itself as it moves, ever more rapidly, through the shorteningepochs.Chapter 13The Wave of TimeThe idea model is complete in its outlines from particle to cosmos, butnevertheless, what remains significantly outside understanding is theprocess by which the nature of the present-at-hand will transform itself atthe onset of a major shift of epochs. Certain themes that we associatewith nonordinary reality or concrescent precursors have yet to be con-nected with the events since March 1971. The speech-become-visible phe-nomenon has played no real part in experiences since that time; yet it wasjust that feature, the outstanding peculiarity of tryptamine ecstasy, thatled us to the Amazon originally (cf. p. 96). Triggering a flood of sharedmental imagery might be accomplished via vocally modulated audial phe-nomena that would illuminate hologramatic images of the imagination-modulated vibration from ionic tryptamines, especially serotonin,metabolizing in vivo, perhaps in the pineal gland. We suggest that chargetransfer involving such tryptamine ions may be the chemical analogs orthe reflection in physical matter of ongoing processes of thought and ideaformation. A major shift of epochs might allow these audio-holograms tobecome telepathically shared or to condense and appear as light or evenmatter.Up to now we have often opposed light and matter, the latterbeing associated with mass and often with electricity, while theformer always appears free from inertia and charge. But if thesefile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (215 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:06 AM"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmtwo fundamental entities of the physical world appear to opposeone another, they are none the less related because they are bothspecial forms of energy. In principle, therefore, there is nothingagainst the view that energy, while always conserving itself, canpass from the material to the luminous form and vice versa. Weknow today that it is actually so; this fact breaks down the barrierwhich seemed to separate light and matter and, to complete theenumeration of the fundamental properties which assure light aprivileged place amongst the physical entities, we can now addthat light is, in short, the most refined form of matter [italics his].(de Broglie 1955, pp. 67-68)The notion of concrescence signifies an abyss of ambiguity, for oncethe monadic hierarchy enters the short epochs preceding concrescence,the normal limitations of three dimensions will be obviated. In the last 2 1/4hours of the duration of space-time, all of the cycles must, in some sense,be repeated several times. What the last epochs of time will be like, as allthings are gathered and focused toward concrescence, remains mysterious.We do not yet know whether the cycle of time we are studying is timecaused by the submolecular energy exchanges in living macromolecules, andthus a biological phenomenon. We speculate that quantum-mechanicalconstraints have configured life and imposed boundary conditions on it,and that DNA is configured as it is because it reflects some quantum-mechanical or astrophysical organizing principle that makes no discrimina-tion between the organic and the inorganic but is as responsible for thenature of nonorganic processes as it is for the manner in which the cell orthe mind is organized. If this is not the case, and the waveform applies ex-clusively to DNA-based organisms, then this would return the problem ofthe origin of the inanimate universe to the cosmologists, and thus fail in itsattempt to serve as a general theory of systems. The correlation of the me-chanics of the wave to solar processes, lunar movements, and equinoctialprecession argues that to suppose this a systems theory of biologicalprocesses exclusively is to make an unnecessarily limiting distinction.Since the wave maps variables reflected in the organization of the psy-che, it naturally has heuristic potential as a mnemonic engine. Surveyingand intensifying one's understanding concerning these retrogressing timecycles is like a preliminary course in atemporal navigation. The standingfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (216 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:06 AM"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmwave-hierarchy contains everything now in the state called active imagina-tion; presumably, it will exist some time in the future as the state called ob-jective, or shared, reality. Comprehension of this unity in a particular ordynamic manner, rather than the quiescent and static total comprehensionof the entire information field represented as some kind of enstasis, is away of seeing, a shamanic path, and is accomplished through applicationof right method to the unitary information field. Anyone using thequantified frames of the hierarchy, especially when applying them to his-tory or to the lunar year, should note that numbers rest on lines that desig-nate days ; yet there are dawn lines, and the day lying between twoposition numbers is a day that runs from dawn to dawn. The idea thatdays begin and end at dawn is third century and Gnostic, according toJonas; later, it was carried over by Manichaeans. We adhere to this idea be-cause during the experiment in March 1971, it was clear that, as far as dailyenergy cycles in the environment are concerned, dawn and, secondarily,dusk are the moments of the opening of the crack between the worlds. In fact, after March 4, 1971, and until we left La Chorrera, the time of theonset of maximum self-revelation of ingressing novelty was quite literallyconcurrent with the sunrise, beginning at the crack of dawn each morn-ing. This moment on our scale is the end of one day and the beginning ofanother.We believe that the importance of the dawn moment is rooted in therelationship between light and living organisms. That such circadian ordaily cycles of light-induced metabolic fluctuations exist is well docu-mented. Research has shown that 5HT (serotonin) in the pineal gland islight synchronized. 5HT is the very metabolite that may allow us the ex-perience of self-reflecting consciousness. This idea clarifies at the neuro-humoral level the intuitive connection felt by all peoples between therising of the sun and the differentiation of the self out of unstructuredchaos; indeed, the connection may be one of cause and effect.Pineal serotonin fluctuates, rising and falling in a daily rhythm.Its persistence after blinding suggested that this rhythm is endoge-nous but synchronized by light and dark. Like melatonin, its lev-els in the pineal seemed to respond to light entering through theeyes, transmitted as nerve messages along the inferior accessoryoptic tract. But unlike melatonin, its increases and decreases werenot explained by enzyme activity. The story was evidently morefile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (217 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:06 AM"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmcomplex and interesting than anyone had forecast, for pineal sero-tonin seemed to follow an endogenous, circadian rhythm that wasentrained by light and darkness in a manner not thoroughly un-derstood. (Luce 1971, p. 126)Thus, our understanding is that a maximum density of novel connec-tion occurs at dawn in any cycle large enough to encompass at least onedawn moment. This assertion might be investigated using the methods ofevaluation that J. B. Rhine developed to evaluate psychic phenomena.A group tested only at the propitious moment each day might be easilycompared with a different group examined daily at a different time orwith a group whose testing had taken no account of the time the test wasadministered.The nearness of a major concrescence to our own time seems a self-evident fact, implicit in the excesses of all sorts that characterize the historyof the twentieth century. Two methods for computing possible dates of afuture concrescence have been found suggestive. The first is simple andinvolves simply propagating 67-plus—year cycles and their subsets forwardin time, with various shifts in the alignment of the scales. The softwareimplementation of the wave, Timewave Zero, allows any date to be stud-ied, and appropriate computer programs could be written to searchamong many dates for a best fit of quantified historical data to thequantified wave-hierarchy. The problem with this, and all approaches ofthis sort, lies in finding a method of quantifying historical data.The second approach to a search of possible dates for future concrescenceis more subtle and takes account of the precession of the equinoxes(cf. p. 130). Because of the precession, the solstice and equinoctial nodes pre-cess or move backward against the background of the fixed stars that com-prise the zodiac. In a 26,000-year zodiacal great year, the solstice andequinoctial nodes move through the entire zodiac. It is a coincidence thenthat in our own time, the winter solstice is placed in the constellation Sagit-tarius, only about 3° from the galactic center, which, also coincidentally iswithin 2° of the ecliptic. Because the winter solstice node is precessing, it ismoving closer and closer to the point on the ecliptic where it will eclipse thegalactic center. This will occur sometime in the next two hundred years. It isdifficult to be more accurate, since the term galactic center is ambiguous.A degree covers a large area in space, and the galaxy may be presumed tofile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (218 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:06 AM"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmhave a gravitational center, a radio center, and a spatial center. Nevertheless,we suggest that the transition from one zodiacal era of approximatelytwenty-two hundred years duration to the next may be hinged on the con-junction of the solstice node and the galactic center. It is useful to examinewinter solstices on which solar eclipses will occur over the next two hundredyears, during which the earth's solstice node will be slowly transiting the areaof the galactic center. When this is done the most likely heliacal rising of thegalactic center with the solstice sun occurs on December 21, 2012. Theeclipse of the galactic center by the solstice sun might be an event unusualenough to signal an onset of concrescence. If a causal connection wereshown, it would implicate the galaxy itself as a major formative influenceupon the structure of the molecules that maintain and define life. That sucha situation would have noticeable effects on life on earth is totally specula-tive. However, ideas of such an archetypal nature do not arise except upon abasis of biological organization.The relation of a time of renewal to the conjunction of the solsticenodes and the galactic center has been noted by others:Considering the fact that the crossroads of ecliptic and Galaxyare crisis-resistant, that is, not concerned with the Precession, thereader may want to know why the Mangaians thought they couldgo to heaven only on the two solstitial days.

The Galaxy is a very broad highway, but even so there musthave been some bitter millennia when neither gate was directlyavailable any longer, the one hanging in midair, the other havingturned into a submarine entrance.Sagittarius and Gemini still mark the solstices in the closingyears of the Age of Pisces. Next comes Aquarius. The ancients, nodoubt, would have considered the troubles of these our times, theoverpopulation, the working iniquity in secret, as an inevitableprelude to a new tilting, a new world-age. (de Santillana and vonDechend 1969, p. 244)Ideas of the sort that form the philosophical basis of our speculationhave reappeared again and again in Chinese thinking. They have beengiven particularly eloquent expression in the thought of Fu-chih (1619-92),whose mathematical extrapolation of the / Ching was familiar to Leibniz:His premise is an ordered continuum of existence, which isgoverned by laws and is all embracing. This continuum lacksappearance —that is, it is not immediately accessible to senseperception. But through the dynamism inherent in existence,images are differentiated out of the continuum which by theirstructure and position partake of the laws of the continuum; theyare, in a sense, individuations of this continuum. On the onehand, these images—that is, the sixty-four situations of the Bookof Changes—can be perceived and experienced; on the otherhand, as embodiments of the law and therefore governed by it,they are open to theoretical speculation. With this they enter intothe field of numbers and may be numerically structured andordered as objects of theory governed by law. Thus each situationcan be apprehended in two ways: through theoretical speculationas a consequence of the continuousness of existence and its gov-ernment by laws. The oracle serves to bring the two aspects intoharmony with each other, to co-ordinate a question resulting fromimmediate, differentiated experience, with the theoretically cor-rect—and the only correct—answer. The questioner thus obtainsaccess to the theoretically established aspect of his own situation,and by reference to the texts set forth under this aspect in theBook of Changes he obtains counsel and guidance from the expe-file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (221 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:06 AM"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmrience of former generations and the insights of the great masters.Thus the synchronicity disclosed by the oracle is merely the appre-hension of two different modes of experiencing the same state ofaffairs. (H. Wilhelm, in Campbell 1967, p. 219)The material in the / Ching that comprises Book II and is traditionallyknown as the Ten Wings represents the earliest commentary on the /Ching extant. This material strongly indicates that the oracle originallyrepresented a perfected knowledge of the patterns through which changemanifests itself. The oldest texts indicate this through references toprocesses involving the / Ching that cannot be construed as simply refer-ring to the traditional yarrow stalk oracle; that is, The future likewise de-velops in accordance with the fixed laws, according to calculable numbers.If these numbers are known, future events can be calculated with perfect accu-racy. This is the thought on which the Book of Changes is based (R. Wil-helm 1964, p. 323) [italics mine]. Another commentary, which RichardWilhelm calls probably very ancient, pursues this theme: . . . countingthat which is going into the past depends on the forward movement.Knowing that which is to come depends on the backward movement.This is why the Book of Changes has backward moving numbers (1964,p. 285). These statements can become rationally apprehendible only if weassume that the author had in mind construing the order of the hexa-grams into some configuration approximate to the configuration that thewave-hierarchy suggests, the configuration suggested by the structure of ahexagram. The whole spirit of the / Ching is one pervaded by the atempo-ral assumption; indeed, the final words of Book I remind us that this is abook of the future. Like the Adamic speculations of the Iranian light re-ligious, the / Ching suggests that its final fulfillment lies in the focus itmight be given in a unique personality. In regard to this latter, it is said ofthe energy in the images: When it comes upon the right man, one whohas inner relationship with this tao, it can forthwith be taken by him andawakened to new life. This is the concept of the supernatural connectionbetween the elect of all ages (R. Wilhelm 1964, p. 349).Chapter 14Evolution and Freedomfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (222 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:06 AM"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmLike every major theory, the contemporary theory of evolution and genetics isan intricate combination of fact, hypothesis, and deduction. In the categoryof established fact belongs evolution as such: that species do change, haveemerged in series of changes from ancestral forms, and in their entirety forma branching family system of common descent in which the simple precedesthe complex, and transitions are gradual. Also an ascertained fact is the oc-currence of mutations; but not their nature or cause. Natural selection is alogical deduction from the two premises of competition and of differences incompetitors, which themselves are facts. The chance-character of mutationsis a hypothesis: the inducement of some of them by external forces, such asradiation, is a fact of laboratory experience, but the claim that these are rep-resentative of all of them and for their underlying dynamics is a mere trialwith Occam's razor, and the sufficiency of this kind of variability for theemergence of the major plans of organization is, so far, more a metaphysicalcontention (or, more soberly, a methodological postulate) than a scientific hy-pothesis—if hypothesis implies construction of at least a mentally workablemodel. [italics ours] (Jonas 1966, p. 44f.)We have already shown the application of the waveform to short-term as-tronomical movements and the precession of the equinoxes. It seems,therefore, not unreasonable to assume that it is applicable to other phe-nomena of longer duration. In the light of the above, we have examinedthe history of the fossil record to determine if major evolutionary eventsare reflected in the quantifications of the modular wave-hierarchy on the1.3-billion-year scale, for if the wave-hierarchy controls the emergent evo-lutionary properties of life in a given moment, it must do so through thecontrol of mutation. Agreement between the quantified temporal graphand fossil record, if substantially proven, would erode orthodox evolution-ary theory, which leans on the hypothesis of chance mutation. In the fol-lowing quotation from L. L. Whyte (1965), we infer that low temperaturequantum mechanical systems refers to the temperatures where organismand metabolism are met:. . . tendency towards the formation of more complex unifiedpatterns does not imply any obscure vitalistic factor, since inappropriate circumstances it can be the direct result of the ten-dency towards arrangements of minimal potential energy. Thusthe potential energy principle can, in complex low temperaturefile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (223 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:06 AM"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmquantum mechanical systems, produce a structuring or formativetendency which, under certain conditions, will shape the geneticsystem towards novel, stable, unified arrangements. Arbitrarychanges in the genetic system may thus be reformed into favorablemutations satisfying the Coordinative Conditions. (p. 56)We have already indicated our belief that the modular wave-hierarchywe have elaborated may be the system that can supply mathematical rigorto the idea of the Coordinative Conditions.If, as Jonas (1966) says, for an evolutionary doctrine to be a scientificone it is essential that the dynamics involved do not contain any elementof teleology, or preformative disposition, or aspiration toward the higherforms to come but that they 'evolve' those higher forms without theirbeing in any way 'involved' on the initial stage (p. 43), then this theory,positing as it does preformation and atemporality of life at its own subjec-tive substratum, seeks to reintroduce teleology to contemporary thoughtat the expense of the satisfying, but logically unfounded, reliance uponthe idea of temporal invariance, which is the foundation of science andscientific notions of proof.Organism is a state wherein matter appears to function, in part, withteleological characteristics associated with the self-experience of mind andbanned from the assumptions of causal materialism. Mind, whose self-expectation is satisfied by freedom (the becoming and goal of its teleol-ogy), discovers itself in experience, functioning in a situation in part (inres extensa) causal. Thus, the teleological completion of mind (freedom initself), when in interphase with matter, creates the still unresolved philo-sophical paradox that organic life represents. Having an interior horizonof transcendence (mind) and the causal encumbrances of physical exten-sion no different from that possessed by nonliving matter, the body is aparadoxical union of opposites. However, the self-experienced teleologyinherent in mind suggests that the teleological perspective may be aprimary intuition of emerging concrescence. Perhaps it is not the mechan-istic fiat of random mutation and adaptive selection that imparts apparentteleology to organic nature, but rather the hierarchical structure of timeexpressing its structure-goal as the shock wave of being in time. The tel-eological pattern operates in each organism and is recapitulated in thegeneral character of the evolutionary enterprise. This pattern representsfile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (224 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:06 AM"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmand gives direction to the seeking of itself, which is equivalent to with-drawal from effects in the res extensa, and which, as process, the processcalled life, actually does impart a preformative teleology to an otherwisemechanistic, causal, and entropy-seeking system, the res extensa. If the me-chanics of mutation were shown to be nonrandom and ordered accordingto this wave-hierarchy (or any other preformative schema), then the pri-mary role of time in imparting teleology to life—via the modulation ofthe density of the coincident events that cause mutation—would beclearly indicated.To gain perspective on the ideas presented in this work and to reducethem to a series of propositions that can be examined independently ofeach other, we present a tentative minimal description of our experimentand its premises:1. The tryptamines, primarily 5HT (serotonin), and the beta-carbolines, primarily harmine, offer an informational readout throughmolecular intercalation into, neural nucleic acids and molecular broadcastof the ESR waveform of information hypothetically stored in the neuralnucleus. In the case of 5HT, this ESR signal represents the electrochemi-cal basis for consciousness as it is typically experienced. The case ofharmine is different. The ESR signal seems to carry more informationthan does the 5HT ESR of normal serotonin metabolism. The refinementof information output and recall quality that attends the shift of normal5HT levels in favor of harmine and related compounds marks, we sug-gest, an adaptative advance of considerable significance. The levels of5HT and beta-carbolines in human neural tissue may be undergoing asteady shift in the direction of increased beta-carboline secretion and in-creased inhibition of 5HT. This shift is responsible for the advance ofconsciousness, consciousness being the self-perceived phenomenon atten-dant upon the improving ESR resolution of the informational hologramof species' experience stored in DNA. The artificially induced inhibitionof MAO and the simultaneous rise in beta-carboline levels in the brainthat accompany ingestion of Banisteriopsis spp. infusions are thus a meansof briefly inducing a state that may anticipate future adaptations ofhuman consciousness, adaptations refined through evolutionary selectionworking among the various ESR transmitters that intercalate into DNAand RNA. The experience attendant upon harmine intercalation differsfrom normal consciousness but is experienced superimposed over it.

This phenomenon can be entirely stabilized. Stability is achievedthrough permanently bonding the harmine resonance unit into DNA andis directly maintained through endogenous synthesis. Stability is achievedthrough techniques using audilely induced ESR harmonic canceling.3. During the application of these techniques, the owner of the DNAso treated will spontaneously produce ever more complete analogical de-scriptions of the configuration and interrelations of the energy patternsstored in the structure of DNA, patterns that imbue life with its character-istically preformative, actually atemporal, teleology. The subject feels theseideas to be arising from a source outside the ego, but within her- or him-self. The subject experiences the imminent presence of an agency, imper-sonal and without limitation, that produces these ideas. He or she not onlyfeels this agency to be the more-than-cybernetic matrix of the DNA butalso the nonego information source assures the subject that this is thecase. Further, it offers ever more elaborate models of itself, which are notonly descriptions of a static goal that will represent complete concrescencebut also, and inherently, these models act predictively relative to when thiscompletion will be achieved. They offer a description of the shiftingboundary conditions that will necessarily modify all the temporal mo-ments that separate the present from this completion. These necessaryboundary conditions may be mapped through a series of mathematical op-erations performed on the / Ching: the time graph, its quantification, andthe quantified modular hierarchy of which it is the basic unit.We have assumed for some time a predictable moment of concres-cence. This idea poses no difficulties for a view seeking to preserve theself-evident phenomenon of free will. The idea of purpose is everywherein a nature reductionist methods have shown to be nonredundant, and itis a matter of common experience that one may make choices and pursuegood or bad influences. Humans, subject to the conditions and condi-tioning of their environment and nature, neither of which nor both to-gether represent an absolute determinism, are free. Human beings are freeas to how they are fulfilled; they freely choose from the possibilities inher-ing within the imposed boundary conditions of the situations in whichthey find themselves, and they realize their choices.file:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (226 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:06 AM"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmThat each entity in the universe of a given concrescence can, so faras its own nature is concerned, be implicated in that concrescencein one or other of many modes; but in fact it is implicated only inone mode: that the particular mode of implication is only ren-dered fully determinate by that concrescence, though it is condi-tioned by the correlate universe. This indetermination, rendereddeterminate in the real concrescence, is the meaning of potential-ity. It is a conditioned indetermination, and is therefore called areal potentiality. (Whitehead 1969, p. 27)Humankind is not, however, free to choose the when of its completion.The actual moment of concrescence is a property of the most inclusiveepoch. In the modular hierarchy of time, it is an imposed fact. Time mustbe well used; this is a basis for a possible theory of ethics. But even timewell used still hurries us and all beings to its own conclusion. To preservethis perception and the idea of a matter- and history-conditioning atem-poral interspecies bio-electronic hologram with a temporally expressedand mathematically describable unfolding, it is necessary to take the fol-lowing view of humankinds freedom to act and the immutability of theorder and rate of novel ingressions. Such ingressions only define boundaryconditions. In the unfolding of novel ingressions, there are moments ofmaximum propitiousness. As the probability of a time of renewal intensi-fies, who can doubt the possibility that humanity, through an act of freewill, may anticipate the new epoch? All philosophy springs from the ideathat the human mind is the measure and leading edge of all things. And itis with poetry and philosophy that we must take that measure.May it not be that the Tao leaves creation unfinished, and humans,who appear according to the will of Tao, are given further levels of cre-ation to weave—the mode of the completion of each level more and morea matter of human decision, of the decisions of visionary humanity? Nowthe time of rebirth has come upon the world again, and though theseyears open wide their solstices and eclipses and windows to the ideas, yet,finally, the manner in which we present ourselves in that cumulatively in-tense final moment may well be a personal decision. Time grows evermore short; in the cosmic year-day of history, dawn is already breakingover Jerusalem.Epiloguefile:///E|/MOVIES/invisible%20landscape.htm (227 of 249)10/29/2004 11:37:06 AM"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"invisible landscape.htmThere can be no certainty at all concerning the outcome of this investiga-tion, nor can a reason be given why this particular idea complex has ap-propriated our attention. Why does it exist so autonomously if it has nomeaning? Yet if it has meaning other than the inevitable transformationthat is its message, what might that meaning be? We include this experi-ence in the category of vision such as Blake and Zosimus experienced or,in a different context, such as Wallace or Descartes knew, yet this visionhas sought to reveal the mechanics of the phenomenon of vision itself,and by way of making its point, it offers a hierarchical model of time anda new attempt to understand organism and mind. Unlike poetry, andmore like science (though teleological structure is unwelcome in scientificspeculation), this idea inherently implies its own testability. Indeed, thetest is self-imposed by the temporal limits of the idea. If it fails the test,what can possibly have been its raison d'etre? Would it not then be a ratherMephistophelian comment on the idea that nature does nothing in vain?The / Ching, which has been indispensable in the formulation of this the-ory, says of itself:Its principles contain the categories of all that is—literally themolds and the scope of all transformations. These categories arein the mind of man; everything, all that happens and everythingthat undergoes transformation, must obey the laws prescribed bythe mind of man . . . fate can be shaped if its laws are known . . .reality is always conditioned, and these conditions of time andspace limit and determine it. The Spirit however is not bound bythese determinants and can bring them about as its own purposerequires. (R, Wilhelm 1964, p. 319)However,A point of reference must be established, and this always requiresa choice and a decision. It makes possible a system of coordinatesinto which everything else can be fitted . . . The problem, then,is to choose one's point of reference so that it coincides with thepoint of reference for cosmic events. For only then can the worldcreated by one's decision escape being dashed to pieces against theprepotent systems of relationships with which it would otherwisecome into conflict. (R.

The search for a general theory of systems isnothing less than the seeking of an encounter with the divine image con-ceived as understanding. It is the quest par excellence and has always beenso. Reality is ever complete in itself and always points beyond itself; thecomplete resolution of this paradox and the understanding it will bringare now nearer than ever before in the long history of our planet. TheConfucian commentary on the Image for hexagram 54, Kuei Mei, TheMarrying Maiden, hopefully prefigures the deliverance of final time:In the autumn everything comes to its end. When thunderis over the lake, the end is near. The eternity of the end is sug-gested by the trigram Chen, which comes forth in the east(spring) and reaches the end of its activity in the west (autumn),in accordance with fixed laws. At that moment the death dealingpower of autumn, which destroys all transient beings, becomesactive. Through knowledge of these laws, one reaches thoseregions which are beyond beginning and end, birth and death(R. Wilhelm 1964, p. 316)Let the times fulfill humanity's most ancient hope.
