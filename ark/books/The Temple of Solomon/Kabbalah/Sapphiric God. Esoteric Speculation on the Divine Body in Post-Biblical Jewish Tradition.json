[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" 1 Sapphiric God: Esoteric Speculation on the Divine Body in Post-Biblical Jewish Tradition Wesley Muhammad, PhD Accepted for publication by The Harvard Theological Review  "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" 2 Brief Abstract A sapphiric-bodied deity, that is to say a deity (often a creator-deity) with an anthropomorphic body the color and substance of the mythologically significant semiprecious stone sapphire/lapis lazuli was a common ancient Near Eastern motif. As participant in the shared ANE mythological tradition could Israel envision her god similarly? We suggest that Israel could. By examining a number of post-biblical Jewish literatures we seek to demonstrate the existence in (at least) post-biblical Judaism(s) of a probably esoteric tradition of a sapphiric-bodied Yahweh. We also make an attempt to understand the mythological significance of a „sapphiric Yahweh‟ in the context of the ancient Near Eastern tradition. While a much more comprehensive study is required in order to determine whether this Jewish „Sapphiric God‟ tradition is indeginous or the result of some later syncretism, the former seems more likely. If so, this tradition further demonstrates that the god of Israel and the gods of the ancient Near East differed less than has been traditionally supposed.  "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" 3 1. Introduction In a famous haggadah the second century Tanna R. Meir, apparently referring to the blue cord (פתיל תכלת) woven into the fringes (ציצית) of the prayer shawl as stipulated in Num. 15:37-41, makes the following observation: Why is blue specified from all other colors [for this precept]? Because blue resembles the colour of the sea, and the sea resembles the colour of the sky and the sky resembles the colour of [a sapphire, and a sapphire resembles the colour of] the Throne of Glory, as it is said: And there was under His feet as it were a paved work of sapphire stone [Ex. 24:10], and it is also written, The likeness of a throne as the appearance of sapphire stone [Ez. 1:26]‟1 While it will attract significant mystical speculation,2 the implications of this haggadah itself seem unremarkable: the Throne of God, like the sea and sky, is blue. As the cited proof-texts show, this rather exoteric doctrine is plainly biblical. Speculation associated with the divine throne is of course an important strand of Jewish mysticism and esotericism (referred to as ma#aśeh merkabah or the “Work of the Divine Chariot-Throne”), but there the „throne‟ is a metonymic reference to the divine body established thereon.3 We are here given to believe as well that something more than the color of divine furniture is alluded to.4 Num. 15:39 says of the blue cord: “And it shall be for you (pl.) a fringe (lit.: „for a fringe‟ לציצית), that you may look upon it (וראיתם אתו) and remember all of the commandments of the Lord...” The אתו is usually translated “it” under the assumption that the reference is to the blue fringe, but R. Meir suggested the reading, “that you may look upon Him.”5 The tassel thereby came to be associated with the visible presence of God, a symbol of the Shekhinah itself.6   1 b.

See Bokser, “The Thread of Blue,”6 n. 4 citing b.Men. 43b. Christopher Rowland suggested that these speculations were connected with certain mystical visionary preparations. The mystic prepared himself to gaze on the divine throne, and its divine occupant, by gazing at the blue tassel: “Looking at the thread of blue in the tassels on the tallith may have assisted the visionary in his vision of the throne-chariot and the glory of God himself.” The Open Heaven: A Study of Apocalyptic in Judaism and Early Christianity (London: SPCK, 1982), 302-05"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 4 In this regard, two later versions of this haggadah are significant. Both are attributed to R. \\ezekiah, though it is suggested that he related one of them on the authority of R. Meir. In Midrash Tehellim (hereafter MT) 24:12, R. \\ezekiah is quoted: In what way does blue differ from other colors, that God should have commanded that it be inserted in the fringes? Because blue (resembles grass, grass) resembles the sea, the sea resembles the sky, the sky resembles a rainbow, a rainbow resembles a cloud, a cloud resembles the heavenly throne, and the throne resembles the divine glory (כבוד), as it says, „As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud, etc. (Ezek. 1, 28).7 Num. R. 14.3 glosses this haggadah with: “He accordingly gave to those who fear Him the color blue which resembles His own glory.”8 In MT 90:18, the climatic finale is the divine Likeness itself (דמות), citing as the proof text Ez. 1:28: „As the appearance of the bow in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about; this was the appearance of the likeness (דמות) of the Glory (כבוד) of Yahweh”. The כבוד, in biblical and post-biblical Jewish tradition, is often a terminus technicus for the luminous, anthropomorphic form of God.9 דמות, often interchangeable with כבוד in some rabbinic texts, likewise refers to the divine, enthroned anthropomorphic form.10 Is it therefore possible to interpret R. \\ezekiah‟s statements as found in the later sources as alluding to a dark blue11 anthropomorphic form of God?

Whatever the dye-source of tĕkhēlet turns out to be (if ever that secret is rediscovered) it is clear that in rabbinic tradition the color was dark blue, even blue-black. Rabbi Isaac Herzog demonstrated this in his D.

Rabbinic tradition frequently associated the blue of the tassel with the sapphire stone.13 Are we then dealing with a tradition among some rabbis of a sapphir-bodied deity similar to the deities of the ancient Near East (ANE)? In biblical tradition and in ancient and medieval texts generally the term „sapphire‟ denoted the semiprecious stone lapis lazuli.14 Considered the “ultimate Divine substance,” sapphire/lapis lazuli possessed great mythological significance in the ANE.15 In its natural state lapis lazuli is deep blue with fine golden spangles, recalling the “sky bedecked with stars” 16; thus the frequently encountered motif of a sapphiric heaven.17 This sapphiric heaven, as the „sky-garment‟ of the gods, was often associated with the divine body, „garment‟ being an ancient and widespread metaphor for body.18 Thus, the leading deities of   12 “Thread of Blue,” 12. 13 See the sources cited and discussed in Bokser, “Thread of Blue,” 12-13. 14 Michel Pastoureau, Blue: The History of a Color (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2001) 7, 21; Dictionary of the Bible (ed.

This is not to suggest that sapphire/lapis lazuli does not appear in ancient literature in more mundane, non-mythological contexts. It certainly does. In the Amarna letters lapis lazuli is listed among the presents exchanged by oriental potentates (see Lissie von Rosen, Lapis Lazuli in Geological Contexts and in Ancient Written Sources [Partille: Paul Åströms förlag, 1988] 34). The royal associations are prevelant, but it is not possible to definatively determine whether the royal use of this and similar colors (e.g. „royal‟ purple) is meant to imitate the divine, or whether they are being used to accord royal characteristics to the divine. The predominantly blue robe of the Jewish high priest (Exod. 28 :31) has royal associations. See Thomas Podella, Das Lichtkleid JHWHs: Untersuchungen zur Gestalthaftigkeit Gottes im Alten Testament und seiner altorientalischen Umwelt (Tübingen: J.C.B. Mohr [Paul Siebeck], 1996) 67-8, but at Qumran it was also associated with the divine kābôd, e.g. in the 12th and 13th Songs of Sabbath Sacrifice 4Q405 20 ii-21-22; 23 ii. See Carol Newsom, Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice: A Critical Edition (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1985) 315; idem, “Shirot „Olat Hashabbat,” in Qumran Cave 4: VI, Poetical and Liturgical Texts, Part 1 (DJD 11; ed.

In a number of Rabbinic texts the „royal‟ garments of the high priest are specifically said to be „after the pattern of the holy garments,‟ i.e. God‟s own „royal purple‟ garments (e.g. Exod. R. 38:8). Nevertheless, it is clear that in the mythological texts/contexts cited below the reference to sapphire/lapis lazuli has cosmogonic significance and is not “merely (a) sign of regal fecundity and prosperity.” 16 On Lapis Lazuli v. Lissie von Rosen, Lapis Lazuli in Geological Contexts and in Ancient Written Sources; idem, Lapis Lazuli in Archaeological Contexts (Jonsered: Paul Åströms förlag, 1990). 17 Exod. 24:10; Ez. 1:26 (LXX); Pliny the Elder described lapis lazuli as “a fragment of the starry firmament” (Natural Hidtory, Book 37).

In Egypt, “The traditional colour of (the) gods‟ limbs (was) the dark blue lapis lazuli.”19 The ANE cult statue, i.e. the earthly body of the deity,20 was ideally made of a wooden core platted with red gold or silver, overlaid with sapphires,21 all of which signified substances from the body of the deity: “his (i.e. Re‟s) bones are silver, his flesh is gold, his hair genuine lapis-lazuli.”22 But the hair too was a metaphor for rays of light emanating from the hair-pores covering the body and lapis lazuli was considered „solidified celestial light‟.23 The whole body was therefore depicted blue.24 This is particularly the case with deities associated with fecundity or creation.25 Mediating between the gold flesh and lapis lazuli „hair‟ or „surrounding splendor‟ of the creator deity is divine black skin, signified by the hide of the black bovine (usually a bull),26 the paramount attribute animal of the ANE creator-deity.27 The       see Geo Widengren, The Great Vohu Manah and the Apostle of God: Studies in Iranian and Manichaean Religion (Uppsala: A.-B.

We hope to demonstrate here that, indeed, a sapphiric-bodied Yahweh was an important feature of post-biblical Jewish (esoteric) tradition.35 Divine polymorphism is attested in a number of haggadic and midrashic texts36; one of the several forms the God of Israel can assume is apparently that of a dark blue anthropos. What is the significance of this divine sapphiric body? What is its relation to the more widely attested luminous kābôd? These questions we hope to answer in the following. We find evidence of Blue Body Divine speculation in apocalyptic, rabbinic, and Heikhalot literatures. We do not suggest that there is any historical continuity or connection between the various traditions of speculation evinced in these disparate literatures (though such may be possible in some cases), only mythological. This myth of the blue-bodied deity, which may go back to biblical times, confirms Israel‟s participation in the ANE mythological tradition. 2. Yahoel and the Divine Body In the Jewish document The Apocalypse of Abraham, believed to have been written sometime during the first or early second century,37 we meet what appears to be a most exalted angel named Yahoel, sent by God to lead the patriarch on a journey to heaven. Yahoel introduces himself as “a power through the medium of his (i.e., God‟s) ineffable name in me (10:3-9).” And I (Abraham) stood up and saw him who had taken my right hand (Yahoel) and set me on my feet. The appearance of his body was like sapphire, and the aspect of his face was like crysolite, and the hair of his head like snow. And a kidaris (was) on his head, its look that of a rainbow, and the clothing of his garments (was) purple; and a golden staff (was) in his right hand. And he said to me, “Abraham...Let my appearance not frighten you, nor my speech trouble your soul. (11:1-6).” The exact nature and identity of this angel has been the subject of significant disagreement. Is Yahoel merely an exalted angel, ontologically distinct from the divine38?

Is he the personification of the Divine Name itself or the Divine Glory40? Or is he God himself, maybe in his “Angel of the Lord” disguise41? The text shows a tension between the first and the last suggestions. First, Yahoel‟s very name is twice-theophoric, composed of both Yahweh (Yahu) and El (\"El). In 17:13, this turns out to be God‟s very name, as is the case in the Apocalypse of Moses 29.4 and 33.5. This seems to be accounted for, however, in 10:3, where we are told that he and God are of the same name and (10:8) that the ineffable name dwells in him.42 This may identify Yahoel with the Name-bearing Angel who personifies the divine Name and mediates God‟s divine presence to creation.43 The confusion between God and this Name-bearing Angel is rooted in the patriarchal יהוה מלאך tradition. This “Angel of the Lord” seems to be God himself manifest in a non-lethal, and therefore humanly accessible, human form; it is this “angelomorphic God,” to use Charles Gieschen‟s term, whom humans encounter during theophanies.44 That Yahoel was understood as God‟s anthropomorphic form is suggested by the physical description given of him by Abraham. He came “in the likeness of a man,” an obvious allusion to Ezekiel‟s vision of God “in the appearance of the likeness of a man (1:27).”45 Yahoel is further connected with God‟s anthropomorphic Glory in Ezekiel through his turban that is “like a rainbow (11.3).” This brings to mind Ezekiel 1:28 where God‟s Glory is said to be “like the bow in a cloud on a rainy day.”46 That the author had Ezekiel on his mind is clear from the description of the (empty) divine throne (18:3ff); it is transparently modeled off of the throne-chariot upon which Ezekiel‟s man-like deity sat (1:4-26).47 Another possible mark of divinity is Yahoel‟s hair that is “like snow (11.2).” This might associate Yahoel with the Ancient   39 Christopher Rowland, “The Visions of God in Apocalyptic Literature,” JSJ 10 (1979): 137-154; idem, “The Vision of the Risen Christ in Rev. i. 13 ff.: The Debt of an Early Christology to an Aspect of Jewish Angelology,” JTS 31 (1980): 1-11; idem, Open Heaven, 101-04; idem, “A Man Clothed in Linen: Daniel 10.6ff. and Jewish Angelology,” JSNT 24 (1985): 99-110. 40 Segal, Two Powers in Heaven, 196; Fossum, Name of God, 318f; Charles A.

Thus, as Andrew Chester observed, “at the very least it can be said that the angel Iaoel is portrayed in terminology usually reserved for God alone.”49 This would include this sapphiric body for, as Andrei Orlov puts it, Yahoel is “a representation of the divine body.”50 Yahoel of the Apocalypse of Abraham suggests that Israel inherited, or at least participated in this blue body divine tradition. His sapphiric body marks him as a divinity, and the cumulative evidence argues in favor of identifying him with the God of Israel. But in the Apocalypse Yahoel is clearly not simply God.51 He worships God (17:2) and he is specifically called an angel (10:5, 12.1, etc.). Two things seem certain here (1) Yahoel is currently not the divinity in the extant text of the Apocalypse and (2) at some point in the early transmission of the myth of Yahoel, if not the text of the Apocalypse, he was identified with the God of Israel or at least his manifest form.52 His apparently reduced status in the Apocalypse may be evidence of early efforts to suppress the widespread tradition of God‟s hypostatic form, as C.R.A. Morray-Jones has argued.53 We have already witnessed such a fall with Metatron and Akatriel, both of whom started their careers as hypostatic forms of God, but ended as demoted archangels.54 Orlov has quite convincingly   48 Gieschen, Angelomorphic Christology, 144; Carrell, Jesus and the Angels, 54; Andrew Chester, “Jewish Messianic Expectations and Mediatorial Figures and Pauline Christology,” in Paulus und das antike Judentum (ed.

Shi#ur Qomah: Measure of the (Dark) Body Divine Gershom Scholem suggested that Yahoel in the Apocalypse was part of a Jewish esoteric tradition.56 That an esoteric doctrine regarding a sapphire-like Divine Body was part of post-biblical Jewish esoterica is demonstrated by the Shi#ur Qomah tradition. Literally “measure of the [divine] stature,” the Shi#ur Qomah texts graphically enumerate the astronomical measurements of the limbs and body parts, as well as their secret names, of a divine anthropos called Yôßer Bĕre\"šît, “creator of the beginning,” i.e. demiurge. The extant recensions of these texts are generally dated to the Geonic period (ca 7th century),57 but Gershom Scholem has demonstrated that the tradition itself probably dates to the Tannaic period (ca. 2nd century C.E.).58 Howard Jackson and C.R.A. Morray-Jones have supplemented Scholem‟s evidence.59 Thus an early second-century date for the mythologoumenon, if not the texts, is likely. The bold anthropomorphism found in the Shi#ur Qomah texts proved scandalous to both medieval Jewish rationalists and some modern scholars.60 Alexander Altmann famously dubbed it “the most obnoxious document of Jewish mysticism”61 and Joseph Dan could only accept the gigantic figures and unintelligible names as proof that the anonymous author‟s intent was anti-anthropomorphism via reductio ad absurdum.62 Besides historical-critical issues, the main problem regarding the Shi#ur Qomah literature, as Dan remarked, is whether “shi#ur qomah” concerns a demiurge ontologically distinct from a putatively   55 Orlov, “Praxis and the Divine Voice”; idem, “ „The Gods of My Father Terah‟: Abraham the Iconoclast and the Polemics with the Divine Body Traditions in the Apocalypse of Abraham,” Journal for the Study of the Pseudepigrapha 18 (2008): 33-53. 56 Jewish Gnosticism, 42. 57 Martin Samuel Cohen, The Shi#ur Qomah: Liturgy and Theurgy in Pre-Kabbalistic Jewish Mysticism (Lanham, MD: University Press of America, 1983) 52ff; idem, The Shi#ur Qomah: Texts and Recensions (Tübingen, 1985); Pieter W. van der Horst, “The Measurement of the Body: A Chapter in the History of Ancient Jewish Mysticism,” in Effigies Dei: Essays on the History of Religions (ed.

Divine gigantism is likewise presupposed in some biblical texts (E.g. Is. 6:1-3, 66: 11). But measurements and secret names is not the only information we get on the body divine.

David Halperin glossed Daniel‟s statement with “whatever that means.”70 The difficulty lies in the Hebrew term itself. Taršîš is used in the Bible to designate a geographical location (Jer 10:9; Ezek 27:12; 38:13), a precious stone (Exod 28:20; 39:13; Ezek 28:13; Cant 5:14), and a proper name (Gen 10:4; I Chr 1:7).71 The term is sometimes taken as a cognate of the Akkadian raà§àu, “to be smelted,” and meaning “refinery,” but this is unlikely.72 As a stone, the term is usually translated either as the sea-blue beryl (Targum Onqelos ad Exod. 28:20; 39:13, AV, RV, JB) or chrysolite (LXX, Quninta and Sexta, Aquila, Vulgate, RIV). The latter term is taken to designate Spanish topaz, a yellow rock-crystal. On the assumption that the geographic Tarshish is to be identified with Tartessus in Spain, where chrysolite is found and not beryl, some scholars assume the former is the correct stone.73 Thus, the BDB defines taršîš as “yellow jasper or other gold-colored stone.”74 But the identification Tarshish/Tartessus is unsound.75 The most we can state with confidence is that “The location of Tarshish is uncertain, since the biblical references are vague and apparently contradictory.”76 On the other hand, strong arguments have been advanced suggesting that taršîš has the meaning “sea-like.” The Targums (Onqelos, Jonathan) often translate the term by “sea,” and Jerome informs us in his commentary on Isaiah 2:16 that he had been told by his Jewish teachers that the Hebrew word for “sea” was taršîš. While Sidney Hoenig understood the term “throughout the entire Bible” as a general expression for „sea,‟77 Cyrus Gordon notes that, when designating the jewel, it signifies the color of the sea in particular, as already perceived by Tg. Ong. (Exod. 28:20; 39:13).78 Gordon argued that the term is from a   70 Halperin, Faces, 75. 71 For a look at these various occurrences and some possible etymologies v. Federic W. Bush and David W.

These poets show some knowledge of Shi#ur Qomah tradition. Thus, in the anonymous piyyut called Attah Konanta „Olam me-Rosh, “You established the world from the Beginning,” we find a description of the high priest in his blue robe that exactly parallels our Shi#ur Qomah passage: His likeness is like taršîš, Like the look of the firmament When he puts on the blue robe, Woven like a honeycomb. (line 103)82 Draped in his blue robe, the high priest‟s likeness is like that of taršîš. “His body is like taršîš” would thus mean that the demiurge‟s body is a dark blue body. Some midrashic passages understand taršîš in Dan 10:6 as a reference to a long sea and therefore as an indication of the great size of the angels.83 This certainly works well with the gigantism of Shi#ur Qomah, but most commentators, rightly it seems to me, assume that the stone is in view here.84 Naomi Janowitz insightfully observed that the Divine Body of Shi#ur Qomah seems to be “made of the mysterious element „tarshish‟.”85 This mysterious element is undoubtedly that „mysterious substance that robes the Eternal himself,‟ i.e. sapphire.

Albright‟s derivation of the term from a taqãîl form of ràà “to smelt.” 80 Gordon understands the term to signify a “wine-red” hue (“The Wine-Dark Sea,” 52), but this is unsupported and unnecessary. A “wine-blue” is likely intended here. A reference to “wine of Khl” chiseled on an early wine decanter possibly from Judah may be a reference to the color of such wine. A. Demsky argued that the כחל here is a reference to the wine‟s color: “„Dark Wine‟ from Judah,” Israel Exploration Journal 22 (1972): 233-234. In late Hebrew כחול means “blue” and in rabbinic sources a dark shade inclining to black (see e.g. Num. R. 2:7). While these are late sources, there is no a priori reason to assume that the color connotation has shifted. The association of the wine color with the sea further confirms that dark blue is the intended color. 81 Athalya Brenner, Colour Terms in the Old Testament (Sheffield: University of Sheffield, 1982) 166-67; Hoenig, “Tarshish,” 182.

Abr.‟s sapphire-bodied Yahoel clearly derive from the same or similar traditions of speculation on the body divine and may have some roots as far back as Mesopotamia;89 in which case we would be back at the ANE tradition of the divine sapphiric body. 3.1. Aquatic Bodies Shi#ur Qomah‟s dark blue demiurgic anthropos seems indeed to be rooted in the ANE myth of the sapphiric-bodied deity, and I suspect that the use of the term taršîš instead of the traditional sapphire makes the same mythological statement about the deity: association with the primordial waters. As noted above, the sapphiric body of the ANE creator-deity is frequently associated with the sapphiric primordial waters from which he emerged.90 Speaking in another context, Morray-Jones noted that the significance of the term taršîš, when used of the Divine Body (and other contexts), is its dual meaning: a precious stone and water.91 I believe this observation is applicable here. The substance of the demiurge‟s body connects it (the body)/him (the demiurge) with the primordial waters. We are immediately reminded, not only of the ANE mythologoumenon, but also of the various Gnostic myths of the „sunken god:‟ the deity who, having glanced at and/or descend to the waters below, became engulfed by them and embodied within them.92   86 Transparent Illusion, passim, but esp. 96, 109, 192-214.

Similarly, for the Docetists of Hippolytus (Ref. VIII 9.4-10.1) the creator god of Genesis is an impression in dark matter of a higher light Aeon.98 The Mandean demiurge Ptahil is a reflection in black water of his father Abathur, an uthra (divine light-being).99 These two figures show some relation to the biblical El (Abathur) and Yahweh (Ptahil).100 In an important variant of this myth, the biblical creator-god is somatically associated with both the blue waters and firmament. According to Irenaeus‟ Ophites (Against the Heretics I.30) Sophia descended and was entrapped by the waters below, from which she acquired a watery-body. After garnering enough strength (“power from the moisture of light”), she was able to escape from the waters and re-ascend upwards. She then spread herself out as a covering, her (blue) watery-body serving as the visible heaven.101 She finally abandoned this blue celestial, aquatic body, which then became Yaldabaoth, the God of Israel.102 This heaven/waters/divine body nexus recalls also the magical invocation to the Jewish God found on a       Religionsgeschichte zu Ehren von Alexander Bohlig (ed.

The relevant portion reads: ...God opened to Ezekiel the seven subterranean chambers, and Ezekiel looked into them and saw all the celestial entities... R. Isaac said: God showed Ezekiel the primordial waters that are bound up in the great sea and in layers; as it is written, Have you come to the layers of the sea [Job 38:16]. He showed him a mountain underneath the river, by means of which the temple vessels will return. While Ezekiel was watching, God opened to him seven firmaments and he saw the Geburah.107 They coined a parable: to what may the matter be likened? A man went to a barber-shop, got a haircut, and was given a mirror to look into. While he was looking into the mirror, the king passed by. He saw the king and his forces through the doorway. The barber turned and said to him, „Turn around and see the king.‟ He said, „I have already seen the mirror.‟108 So Ezekiel stood by the river Chebar and looked into the water, and the firmaments were opened to him and he saw God‟s glory (kabod), and the Èayyot, angels, troops, seraphim, and sparkling-winged ones joined to the merkabah. They passed by in the heavens and Ezekiel saw them in the water. So it is written: At the river Chebar [Ez. 1:1].109 Ezekiel sees in the primordial waters the image/reflection of the divine anthropos enthroned110 along with his host. As Halperin has seen and as the parable leaves no room to doubt, behind this haggadah is clearly the myth of the sunken image of the (yet unfallen) deity. Hans Jonas describes this mythic motif: (The motif) implies the mythic idea of the substantiality of an image, reflection, or shadow as representing a real part of the original entity from which it has become detached...By its nature the Light shines into the Darkness below. This partial illumination of the Darkness..., if it issued from an individual divine figure such as Sophia or Man, is in the nature of a form projected into the dark medium and appearing there as an image or reflection of the divine...though no real descent or fall of the divine original has taken place, something of   103 PGM IV. 3065.

We have modified the translation in order to bring out what we believe is the true sense of this passage. The amulet reads: οσρανοειδη, {θ}ζxοηοειδη θαλαζζοειδη xαι πανηόμορθε which Keil translates “du Himmelsgestaltiger, Meeresgestaltiger, Dunkelgestaltiger, du Allgestaltiger” (80). PGM IV. 3065 reads: οσρανοειδη, θαλαζζειδη, νεθελοειδη, which is translated in Betz as, “[the] skylike, sealike, cloudlike”: The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation, Including the Demotic Spells (ed.

The Betz translation of PGM IV 3065 obscures the obvious morphic focus of the passage.

In the mystical literature both are often technical terms denoting the divine anthropos upon the merkabah. See Wolfson, Through a Speculum, 47-8, 193; Morray-Jones, “Transformational Mysticism,” 2-6."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 19 itself has become immersed in the lower world...in this way the divine form...becomes embodied in the matter of Darkness...111 The cited parable distinguishes between the king and the king‟s image seen in the mirror. The customer‟s declaration, “I have already seen the mirror (mar‟ah),” is a play on mar‟eh, “vision/appearance.” For him, seeing the image in the mirror is tantamount to seeing the king himself. This word-play also implies some sense of identity between the image and the medium. This identity is explicitly articulated in later mystical and esoteric tradition. In zoharic Kabbalah the Shekhinah or God‟s visible, blue-black body (Malkhut) is the “mirror in which another image (i.e. His luminous image, Tiferet) is seen, and all the upper images (the sefirot) are seen in it”112; she is also the Sea (yamah), the waters in which and through which the divine image can be seen.113 As the Sea, the zoharic Shekhinah is symbolized by blue, which color denotes the luminous presence of the divine image (Tiferet) within the dark waters.114 Thus, returning to the Visions of Ezekiel, Halperin reasons: When the merkabah appears in the waters, the upper realms are merged into the lower. Ezekiel...looks into „the subterranean chambers‟ and sees in them what ought to be in heaven...The paradox of the merkabah in the waters...brings the upper world into the nether world; it makes the distinction between above and below insignificant; it turns the merkabah, like any reflection in water, into part of the fluid and shapeless chaos that God once had to defeat... God had indeed, as the old traditions claimed, suppressed the chaos-waters. But chaos had its revenge. The water, by virtue of its power of reflection, ensnared its enemy‟s image, assimilated the merkabah to itself, and thus infected God with its own formlessness...But Ezekiel saw something else beneath God‟s throne: a firmament the color of terrible ice (Ezekiel 1:22). To the early Jewish expositors, I suggest, this meant that God had frozen solid the terrible waters against which he fought, and thus defeated them. By its fluidity and formlessness, chaos is the enemy of order and structure...the hardening of water into glass symbolizes God‟s triumph over chaos.115 In the light of Morray-Jones‟ discussion of taršîš we suspect Halperin‟s reasoning is correct. 3.2.

And His Face and the splendor thereof shine forth and give light from within the cloud of thick darkness that surrounds Him.” The “cloud of thick darkness” from within which the splendor of God‟s Face, i.e. His luminous anthropomorphic form (kābôd), shines forth seems somehow related to the „body like taršîš,” though just how is not obvious. The idea that God surrounds his luminance with dark clouds is biblical: „He made darkness His covering around him, his canopy thick clouds dark with water. Out of the brightness before him there broke through his clouds hailstones and coals of fire (Ps. 18:12-13).‟ In a number of post-biblical texts the cloud has somatic significance. Adam‟s pre-lapsarian body, his “garment of light,” was a “cloud of glory.” This cloud of glory, lost after Adam‟s sin, will again clothe the elect in the new paradise.116 In a third century Samaritan hymn cycle describing the Sinaitic glorification of Moses, we read: “Exalted be the Prophet, and exalted be his prophethood!...Verily he was clothed with a garment with which no king can clothe himself. Verily he was covered by the cloud and his face was clothed with a ray of light”.117 “Clothed with a garment” is here parallel to “covered with a cloud.” As Jarl Fossum notes: “The cloud functions as an outer garment, as it were.” He argues that “the brilliant garment and the cloud...are variants of the same theme.”118 As he and April De Conick have pointed out as well, garment and cloud here denote the Divine Form or Body with which Adam was initially vested, but lost, and which was regained by Moses on Mt. Sinai: “He (Moses) was vested with the form which Adam cast off in the Garden of Eden; and his face shone up to the day of his death.”119 In kabbalistic tradition, the black rain cloud (חשך וענן) and intense darkness (ערפל) which served as Yahweh‟s covering and as the sign of his theophanic presence during the wilderness wandering can be identified with the Shekhina or rather the black „divine skin‟ veiling the divine luminosity.120   116 PRE 14.20.

It appears that the former alludes to a blue iridescence produced by the kābôd‟s/pānîm‟s presumably white brilliance as it flashes out of the dark cloud-like body. Thus Synopse §371: “And around the throne are pure thunder clouds, which give forth lightning flashes like jewels of taršîš.” The light flashing through the “cloud” therefore has the appearance of taršîš. We recall the ANE tradition of sapphire light passing through the hairpits of dark-skinned deities. Synopse §371 continues: “As the likeness of them both, sapphire and taršîš, thus is the likeness of hašmal. It is like the appearance of fire, but it is not fire. Rather, it is like fiery flames of all kinds of colors mixed together, and the eye cannot master their likeness.” The sapphire/ taršîš blue is here likened to a flame-like substance of “all kinds of colors mixed together”. We are now in a better position to understand the rather enigmatic description of the divine glory or its „surrounding splendor‟ as similar to a rainbow.121 As Ezekiel described it: “Like the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud on a rainy day, so was the appearance of the surrounding splendor. This was the appearance of the likeness of the Glory of the Lord (1:28).” Based on this passage a tradition developed regarding God‟s rainbow-like body: “his body resembles a bow, and the bow is (something) like the semblence of fire...”122 The relationship between the rainbow-like appearance of God described by Ezekiel and the dark, cloud-like body suggested in Shi„ur Qomah and Kabbalah is apparently the same as that between a rainbow and a rain cloud. As the cloud acts as a prism, refracting the sunlight and producing the beautiful colors of the rainbow, the “dark body” refracts the luminance of the divine kābôd/pānîm, producing a rainbow-like, or alternately, a sapphiric blue, “surrounding splendor (Ezek. 1:28).” As Elliot Wolfson so eloquently put it: “The divine woman (i.e. the Shekinah, God‟s corporeal manifestation) is an „optical apparatus‟ that refracts the light and renders the veiled image visible, like a rainbow that is manifest in the covering of the cloud.”123 The rainbow-like appearance of the kābôd‟s/pānîm‟s surrounding splendor therefore presupposes       2001] 48, 51-53; idem, “Torah: Between Presence and Representation of the Divine in Jewish Mysticism,” in Representation in Religion: Studies in Honor of Moshe Barasch (ed. Jan Assmann and Albert I. Baumgarten; Leiden: Brill, 2001), 205. Idel uses the term „divine skin‟ in reference to the white fire of the anthropomorphic Torah, the „soul‟ or internal form (Tefirot), if you will. But in as much as the black fire denoted the external form, i.e. the body (see Elliot R. Wolfson, Circle in the Square: Studies in the Use of Gender in Kabbalistic Symbolism [New York: State University of New York Press, 1995] 59: “the [black] letters...comprise the visible form of God”), the term “divine skin” is more appropriate in relation to the black fire. 121 See also Gen. R. 35.3; Exod. R. 35.6. 122 Synopse §367. Thus the Zohar interprets the Talmudic dictum not to gaze at a rainbow (b. Hag. 16a): “It is forbidden for a person to look at the rainbow, for it is the appearance of the Supernal Image (3:84a).” See also Gen. R. 35.3, where “My bow (qashti) is read as “My Likness (qishuthi).” On the significance of the rainbow in Jewish mysticism v.

The Blue Body Divine in Rabbinic Materials The origin, time and milieu of composition, and identity of the authors of Heikhalot literature are still unresolved issues.126 Also unresolved is the relation between Heikhalot literature and rabbinic tradition. While some scholars, such as Sholem and Ithamar Gruenwald hold that the literature preserves esoteric traditions of the tannaim and amoraim,127 others, such as Ephraim Urbach, Peter Schäfer and David Halperin, emphasizing the differences between rabbinic and Heikhalot literatures, argue that the traditions found in the latter are non-rabbinic and even literarily dependent on rabbinic sources.128 But the existence of independent, maybe pre-rabbinic traditions that served as sources to the Heikhalot authors has been strongly argued and the likelihood some of these traditions provide the context for understanding the talmudic allusions to (possibly) esoteric doctrines is considerable.129 We suggest that this is the case here as there are in some rabbinic sources evidence of (esoteric) Blue Body Divine speculation.   124 According to Lev. R. 23.8 clouds are a prerequisite for a sapphiric blue heaven. Without the clouds, the firmament is clear and free of its “sapphiric” qualities. 125 Faces, 260-61. 126 For a summary of the various views on these questions see Daphna Arbel, Beholders of Divine Secrets: Mysticism and Myth in the Hekhalot and Merkavah Literature (Albany, NY.: State University of New York Press, 2003), Chapter One. 127 On Scholem see works cited above, n. 53; Ithamar Gruenwald Apocalyptic and Merkavah Mysticism; idem, From Apocalypticism to Gnosticism.

Divine Exiles and Sapphiric Bodies An early piece of evidence of rabbinic Blue Body Divine speculation may be related to the rabbinic Shekhinta ba-Galuta (Shekhinah in Exile) tradition.130 God went into exile with Israel; he shared in all of her afflictions and, when she is redeemed, so too will he be. In Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael, a second century collection of midrashim on the Book of Exodus, we read: „Even the Selfsame Day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt (Exod. 12:41).‟ The hosts of the Lord are the ministering angels. And so you find that whenever Israel is enslaved the Shekhinah, as it were, is enslaved with them, as it is said: “And they saw the God of Israel; and there was under His feet [the likeness of a pavement of sapphire”]. But after they were redeemed what does it say? “And the like of the very heaven for clearness” (Exod. 24:10). And it also says: “In all their affliction He was afflicted” (Isa. 63:10).131 Our midrashist here contrasts two divine states: the first, the Shekhinah‟s enslavement in Egypt with Israel, is indicated by the sapphire pavement under God‟s feet according to Exod. 24:10; the other, God‟s own redemption, is indicated by “the like of the very heaven for clearness.” The latter quote, in the biblical text, is actually a description of the sapphire pavement,132 but for our midrashist it denotes a separate and contrary divine state. The sapphire pavement is associated with God‟s suffering, an important rabbinic motif.133 As commentators have pointed out, the connection between the sapphire stone and Israel‟s sojourn in Egypt is made by reading libnat ha-sappir, “paved work of sapphire,” as an allusion to lebenim, “bricks” (Exod. 1:14), i.e. the brick-work characteristic of Israelite enslavement in Egypt. “(J)ust as Israel below is enslaved by the bricks of Egyptian servitude, so too God has to place bricks (i.e., sapphire stones-WW) beneath his feet.”134 When Israel are redeemed, so too will God be redeemed from the sapphiric stones.

R. Eleazar ha-Darshan in his Sefer ha-Gematriyot reports the following tradition from the lost Midrash Abkir: “The likeness of a pavement of sapphire – this alludes [to the fact that] just as Israel were treading the mortar with their feet to make bricks, so it was, as it were, above, „in all their troubles he was troubled‟.”136 One of the implications of this tradition is that, as the feet of the Israelites were soiled by an overlay of mortar during their labor, so too were the feet of the Shekhinah (ragle Shekhinah) covered with sapphire. The significance of this can be fully appreciated only when we consider the fact that ragle Shekhinah is rabbinic idiom denoting the anthropomorphic, terrestrial Presence of God, the lower Glory, if you will, cognate with pene ha-Shekhinah, the Face of the Presence, the fiery kābôd or upper Glory.137 The further implication is that this anthropomorphic Glory is covered with sapphires like the feet of the Israelites.138 This association of the biblical „pavement under God‟s feet‟ with a sapphiric „soil‟ covering the ragle Shekhinah illuminates a midrash that seems to allude to the somatic transformation of the divine. „But they had no comforter.‟ Says the Holy One, blessed be He: „It shall be My task to comfort them.‟ For in this world there is dross in them, but in the World to Come, says Zechariah, I have seen them all gold, all of them pure gold: hence it is written, „I have seen, and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a gulah (bowl) upon the top of it-roshah (Zech. IV, 2). Two amoraim differ on the meaning of „gulah‟. One reads golah and the other reads go‟alah. He who reads „golah‟ explains it to mean that they had been exiled (gulah) to Babylon and the Shekhinah had accompanied them into exile; as it says, „For your sake I have been sent to Babylon (Isa. XLIII, 14)‟. He who reads go‟alah renders „redeemer‟, as it says, „Our Redeemer (go‟alenu), the Lord of hosts is His name (ib. XLVII, 4),‟ and it is written, „The breaker is gone up before them; they have broken forth and passed on, by the gate, and are gone out thereat; and their king is passed on before them, and the Lord at the head of them-berosham (Micah II, 13).‟139 We first notice that our midrashist draws an analogy between the eschatological Israel and the golden menorah seen by Zechariah. Underlying this analogy is the widespread motif of the eschatological somatic   135 Kabbalah: New Perspectives (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1988) 226. 136 Cited by Idel, Kabbalah, 382, n. 101. 137 As demonstrated by Wolfson, “Images of God‟s Feet,” 143-181. 138 The idea that the sapphiric pavement of Exodus 24:10 symbolized the lower, anthropomorphic Glory through which the upper, luminous Glory is made visually manifest was the esoteric doctrine of the 10th century philosopher, scientists, and Jewish mystic of southern Italy Shabbetai Donnolo. See Wolfson, “Images of God‟s Feet,” 155-156; idem, “The Theosophy of Shabbetai Donnolo, with Special Emphasis on the Doctrine of Sefirot in His Sefer \\akhmoni,” Jewish History 6 (1992): 281-316; idem, Through a Speculum, 127-144. 139 Lev.

Redemption from exile and the eschatological transformation are here conflated, and the use of Micah 2:13 suggests that God, in exile with Israel, will lead them in redemption.142 The implication is that God will lead Israel in experiencing this somatic transformation. The dross here parallels the mortar soiling the feet of the Israelite slaves in Egypt and, as in that case, the divine counterpart is signified by the sapphire throne.143 The overall context therefore suggests that the sapphire has somatic significance: corporeal accretion from which Yahweh will be redeemed. 4.2. „His body is ivory work, encrusted with sapphires‟ Further evidence of Blue Body Divine speculation among rabbinic circles is certain midrashim on Cant. 5:14: “His arms are rounded gold, [covered with jewels (taršîš). His body is ivory work, encrusted with sapphires].” This of course is a description of the Lover, whom rabbinic tradition very early identified with the God of Israel both in the context of an allegorical love song between he and Israel (here the maiden), and as a literal description of Yahweh as he physically appeared to Israel at the Red Sea.144 In Cant. R. 5.12, Cant. 5:14 is glossed: “This refers to the tablets of the covenant: And the tablets were the work of God (Ex. 32:16).” Morray-Jones, who has analyzed this midrash in the light of the Talmudic and Heikhalot Water Episode, finds this discussion “unsatisfactory and problematic.” The main problem is lack of clarity: on what basis is this connection between God‟s hands and the tablets made? “Although the biblical account states that the tablets were made by God (Exod. 32:16) and that he wrote on them with his own finger (Exod. 31:18), the statement that the tablets were the hands of God makes no apparent sense   140 Morray-Jones, “Transformational Mysticism”; Willem F.

In parallel midrashim God‟s accompaniment of Israel in exile in Babylon is denoted by the sapphiric divine throne encountered by Ezekiel at the river Chebar (Ezek. 1:26; y. Sukk 4:3). 144 Arthur Green, “The Song of Songs in Early Jewish Mysticism,” Orim: A Jewish Journal at Yale 2 (1987): 49-63; Gerson D.

Joshua b. R. Nehemiah as the key to unraveling this “confused” midrash: “They were of miraculous construction, for they were rolled up. They were of sapphire146”. This association of the tablets with Cant. 5:14 seems to have originally pivoted around the term sapphirîm.147 As Morray-Jones points out, tradition held that the tablets were cut from the sapphire pavement of the firmament beneath God‟s throne.148 While this accounts for the sapphiric tablets, it still does not elucidate their identity with God‟s hands as Morray-Jones is given to believe.149 We are thus still at a loss in terms of the connection between the sapphire tablets and the divine hands. But if indeed „sapphire‟ is the link, it is reasonable to assume that the hands, like the tablets, are “of sapphire.” In fact, if the hands are the tablets, then the hands must be “of sapphire.” Indeed, a related midrash in TanÈuma‟ (#eqeb, §9) declares: “as it is said: „His hands are rounded gold...wrapped with sapphires,‟ for they were made of sapphire.”150 The tradition lurking beneath Cant. R. 5:12 might therefore be a tradition that included speculation on the divine sapphiric body. This very passage (Cant.5:14) seems to confirm this: “His (i.e., God‟s) body is ivory work, encrusted with sapphires.” 4.3. Garments of (Divine) Skin There is a long tradition, going back at least as far as Philo of Alexandria (15 BCE-50 CE), of interpreting the “garments of skin” of Gen. 3:21 somatically, i.e. as Adam and Eve‟s fleshy body.151 There is also a long tradition associating these „garments of skin‟ with the high priestly garments, particularly the long blue robe (me‟il) and golden/multicolored ephod.152 As Gary Anderson has shown, Gen. 3:21 was   145 Morray-Jones, Transparent Illusion, 207. 146 Morray-Jones‟ reading of סנפירינון של: Transparent Illusion, 206. 147 Morray-Jones, Transparent Illusion, 207. 148 See e.g. TanÈuma‟, #eqeb, §9; Sifre Num. 101; v. also Ginzberg, Legends, vol. 7, index s.v. “Sapphire.” 149 Morray-Jones, Transparent Illusion, 207. 150 See also Morray-Jones‟ discussion, Transparent Illusion, 208-9. 151 On the somatic reading of these garments in rabbinic literature v. especially Gary Anderson, Genesis of Perfection: Adam and Eve in Jewish and Christian Imagination (Louisville: Westminster John Knox Press, 2001) 117-134; idem, “The Garments of Skin in Apocryphal Narrative and Biblical Commentary,” in Studies in Ancient Midrash (ed.

It was the colored garments, the robe and ephod, which served as metaphor for Adam and Eve‟s prelapsarian bodies.156 According to Gen. R. 21.5 Adam in his glorious vestment in the Garden was like a snail “whose garment (i.e. shell) is part of his body.” The point here is clearly a somatic interpretation of „garment‟ with regard to Adam.157 But this snail has a purple (read: blue, tĕkhēlet) shell and the „garment‟ to which it is parallel is a purple (read: blue) „garment.‟158 The white robe may signify the resurrection body of the righteous;159 it may signify the luminous body of some angels;160 it may even represent God‟s „garment of light‟ from which the phōs of       East, presented to J.H.

Jacob of Kefar \\anan Gen. 3:21 really belongs after Gen. 2:25, thus describing the prelapsarian garments of the first couple (Gen. R. 18.6). Its current placement in the text has only to do with narratological concerns, not chronological. See Anderson, “The Garments of Skin,” 112-15. On the other hand, in b. Nid. 25a R. Yehoshua b. \\aninah identifies the “coats of skin” of Gen. 3:21 with normal human skin, which is post-lapsarian. The Targums attempt to secondarily weave these two traditions together by identifying the garments of glory with the fleshy body (See Anderson‟s detailed discussion, ibid., 120-123). 154 These two possibilities derive from the עור כתנות, “garments of skin” of MT Gen. 3:21 and its homophonous equivalent כתנות אור, “garments of light,” from a textual variant.

Plato, Phaedrus 250 C and Philo, Vir. 76. 158 See Ginzberg, Legends 2:132, 237. The exact hue of the biblical tĕkhēlet has been a matter of great discussion; see above. Ancients and moderns often translate it as “purple,” identifying the tĕkhēlet robe of the high priest with royal regalia. This is certainly the case in rabbinic literature (cf. Pesikta Rabbati [hereafter PR] 33. 10; MT 23.4) 159E.g. Rev. 3:4, 7:9 160 On the white garment and angels v.

But according to PR 20.4, while in heaven Moses saw four sets of angels, the first of which were draped in garments “the color of the sea (i.e. tĕkhēlet).” When Rebekah saw Isaac for the first time as he meditated in a field (Gen. 24:63-64) “she beheld him exceedingly glorious, garmented in and covered with a (blue-fringed) prayer shawl, his appearance like that of an angel of God (MT 90.18, trns. Braude, Midrash on Psalms 2:98)."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 28 Gen. 1:3 (LXX) emanated.161 But God also possesses a royal purple robe after which the colored high priestly garments are patterned.162 It is this „purple‟ high priestly robe that signifies the divine Image.163 Further evidence that the prelapsarian „garment‟ was the colored high priestly robe is supplied by the tradition of Israel‟s glorification at Sinai after the giving of the Torah. The Israelites were deified164 and garmented in God‟s own splendor as reflected in the „purple‟ high priestly robe.165After the Golden Calf incident, however, they were stripped of this glory.166 What is important here is that, according to a widespread rabbinic tradition, Sinai was a recapitulation of Eden.167 Israel‟s glorification at the former was tantamount to Adam and Eve‟s prelapsarian glory in the latter;168 Israel‟s garments of glory, which they lost after „that deed‟ were the same that Adam and Eve lost after their transgression in the Garden.169 As Israel‟s were the colored high priestly robe, so too was Adam and Eve‟s. Several rabbinic sources therefore make it clear that it is the splendid colored high priestly garments, not the white linen tunic, that represent Adam‟s prelapsarian body made as/according to God‟s Image.170 But this creates an immediate exegetical problem for us. How could a dark blue robe come to be regarded as a “garment of light”171? This interpretive difficulty probably encouraged some writers to associate the garment with the white tunic. But we get an adequate answer to this question from our sources. The blue robe is associated with a precious stone, usually sapphire. The blue of the robe, tĕkhēlet, is a sapphire   161 On God‟s garment of light v. Scholem, “Some Aggadic Sayings Explained by Merkabah Hymns.

As Gershom Scholem and Ira Chernus have observed, this reading connects these garments with God‟s own which is described in Heikhalot Rabbati 3.4 as being “engraved from within and without YHWH YHWH.” Gershom Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism, Merkabah Mysticism, and Talmudic Tradition (New York: The Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1965), 131-32; Ira Chernus, Mysticism in Rabbinic Judaism (Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 1982), 9. 166 Exod.

See also Kaminsky, “Paradise,” 26. 170 Taken as a possible exception may be the description given in the name of Resh Laqish that they “were milky white [in color] and in them the first-born sons [prior to Sinai] served as priests (Gen. R.20:12).” But as Gary Anderson has argued, this unit is secondary and refers to the first couple‟s post-lapsarian garments. See “The Garments of Skin,” 116-17. 171 One could, of course, point to the precious stones affixed to the breastplate (Exod. 28:15-21). A number of Second Temple sources describe these stones as sources of light (See sources and discussion in Crispin H.P. Fletcher-Louis, All The Glory of Adam: Liturgical Anthropology in the Dead Sea Scrolls (Leiden: Brill, 2002) 222-251; Robert Hayward, “Pseudo-Philo and the Priestly Oracle,” JJS 46 [1995] 43-54). But this explanation is unsatisfactory. The breastplate is not, per se, a garment, but an accessory. The Adamic „garment of light‟ alludes to Adam‟s prelapsarian body in a way that the breastplate cannot."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 29 blue.172 With its deep blue color and fine golden spangles sapphire/lapis lazuli reminds one of both the „sky-garment‟ of the gods and later representations of the priestly robe and ephod. In the mosaic from the synagogue in Sepphoris (ca. fifth century) Aaron‟s robe is depicted dark blue with golden dots173 and in a wall-painting at Dura Europos (3 cent. CE.) Aaron dons a wine-colored, jewel-studded cape, which some scholars take to be a representation of the robe or ephod.174 The yellow jewels are similar to the gold dots on the priestly robe in the Sepphoris mosaic and the stars on the divine „sky-garment.‟175 The parallel between lapis lazuli, the ANE „sky-garment,‟ and these depictions of the high-priestly vestments is unmistakable. The sapphire stone with its golden spangles was the source of great illumination according to a number of rabbinic sources: it illuminated Noah‟s ark with a light as bright as day and in the New Jerusalem it will shine like the sun.176 This „paradox‟ of a dark blue stone giving off bright luminance was seen as an example of God‟s ability to harmonize two antagonistic elements in creation.177 Significantly this point is illustrated with the angel of Dan. 10:6 whose body is like the taršîš stone and whose face (i.e. inner glory?178) is like lightning in appearance. The space given here to a discussion of Adam‟s prelapsarian garments is justified on two accounts. First, in Jewish and Christian tradition these garments are metaphor for Adam and Eve‟s prelapsarian bodies.179 Secondly, bodily descriptions of prelapsarian man in rabbinic texts as a rule apply equally to God, for “Adam originally had a physical appearance which was indistinguishable from that of God.”180   172 Sifré to Numbers 115.2; b.

These apparent rabbinic allusions to a sapphiric-bodied Yahweh, when coupled with the explicit assertion in Num. R. 14.3 that the divine Glory is tekhelet and in Midrash Tehilim (90.18) that the divine Likeness has the appearance of tekhelet, give strong evidence of a Blue Body Divine tradition, one continuous with that evidenced in the Shi#ur Qomah materials and, more generally, ANE mythological texts. 5. Conclusion Ben Zion Bokser pointed out that “Jewish mystics deemed the color blue a representation of the deity.”182 We now have a better understanding why. Like the gods of the ancient Near East the god of Israel, at least as represented in the various post-biblical literatures treated above, possessed a dark body. This body, the speculum that does not shine, was a dark bodily “veil” enveloping Yahweh‟s kābôd or luminous anthropomorphic glory.183 The radiance of the kābôd shinning through the hair-pits of the divine black skin produced a beautiful blue iridescence or surrounding rainbow, like sunlight passing through a rain-cloud.184 Like the god‟s of the ancient Near East, this divine blue-ness was associated with sapphire/lapis lazuli, but also taršîš. The latter suggests a connction with the primordial waters, as did the sapphiric body of the ANE deities. This „sapphiric god‟ motif thus further indicates the continuity between ancient Near Eastern and post-biblical Jewish tradition. This sapphiric-bodied deity found in the the Apocalypse of Abraham and Shi#ur Qomah appears to be esoterically alluded to in such rabbinic passages as MRI, PisÈa, § 14 (and parallels); MT 24:12; 90:18; Num. R. 14:3; Cant. R. 5:12, among others.   181 He makes the point that, according to the theology of the Oral Torah, “God and man look exactly alike, being distinguished only by actions performed by the one but not the other.” The Theology of the Oral Torah (Montreal and Kingston: McGill and Queen‟s University Press, 1999) 364-65.

A sapphiric-bodied God of Israel? While recognition and discussion of Yahweh‟s morphic luminosity is now quite common place, this trope of the Blue Body Divine is, as far as this author is aware, unrecognized; discussions of rabbinc anthropomorphism and the mystical conceptions of divinity make no mention of it,185 nor does Howard Schwartz in his otherwise thorough presentation of Judaic “Myths about God.”186 Such imagery is antithetical to a fundamental axiom of the monotheistic traditions according to which God is a god of light and darkness participates none in his being. For sure, there is a hint of Gnostic dualism here, as argued by Octavius A. Gaba, but the seeds of the negative valuation of darkness and its alienation from the Godhead are found already in the Bible, particularly the New Testament (NT).187 “God is light and in him there is no darkness at all (I Jhn 1:5).” Yahweh‟s kābôd, Jesus as Logos, and Allah‟s Nūr (Light) all reinforce the point: divinity is luminosity.188 The recognition of this Judaic Blue Body Divine trope forces us to reevaluate this axiom, for the trope suggests that both light and darkness participate in the divine ontology. This duality in the divine nature is continuous with ANE mythic tradition, reinforcing the point that the god of Israel and the gods of the ANE differed less than has been supposed. Gershom Scholem therefore missed the mark by suggesting that „pagan color symbolism‟ was nontransferable to the “unsensual” biblical and Judaic God.189 Whench cometh this sapphiric God into Jewish tradition? Rachel Elior suggests that the taršîš–bodied demiurge of the Shi#ur Qomah materials was a new, revolutionary concept of God innovated by the anonymous authors of the Heikhalot literature and is discontinous with the “supramythological, supernatural” God of biblical and rabbinic tradition.190 Daphna Arbel has further suggested that this description of the divine found in the Shi#ur Qomah materials resonates with “echoes of Mesopotamian   185 See e.g. the discussion of divine body traditions in biblical, pseudepigraphal, and rabbinic materials by Andrei Orlov, The Enoch-Metatron Tradition (TSAJ, 107; Tübingen: Mohr/Siebeck, 2005). 186 Tree of Souls, 3-68. 187 As demonstrated by Gaba as well: “Symbols of Revelation: The Darkness of the Hebrew Yahweh and the Light of the Greek Logos,” in The Recovery of the Black Presence: An Interdisciplinary Exploration.

Such texts as MRI, PisÈa, § 14 indicate that the trope is much earlier than what the Heikhalot literature might suggest. In another writing I argue that the priestly redactor of the Pentateuch („P‟) and Philo of Alexandria give evidence of an ancient temple tradition of a sapphiric God.192 It is therefore more likely that the similarities between Mesopotamian and post-biblical Jewish descriptions of God evince not late antique syncretism but an indeginous, at least an ancient, part of Israel‟s mythic tradition, which she shares in common with her neighbors in the ANE.    191 See above n. 84. 192 Forthcoming."}]
