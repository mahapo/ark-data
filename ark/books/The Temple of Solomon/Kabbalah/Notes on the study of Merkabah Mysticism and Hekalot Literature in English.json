Karr (Ithaca: KoM #5, 1985), pages 17-20, which is reprinted below as APPENDIX 2. MERKABAH (= CHARIOT) MYSTICISM developed primarily out of speculation on and expansion of the visions of Ezekiel (CHAPTERS 1, 8, and 10) and, to a lesser extent, Isaiah (CHAPTER 6) and Daniel (CHAPTER 2). This strain of mysticism meanders through the intertestamental pseudepigrapha1 and even touches corners of gnostic and Qumran texts.2   1 1 Enoch 14; The Life of Adam and Eve (including The Apocalypse of Moses); The Apocalypse of Abraham. For translations of these, see James H. Charlesworth (ed.), The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, Volume 1 (Garden City: Doubleday and Company, 1983). 1 Enoch 14 is particularly important. Gruenwald (in AMM, p. 36) says, “...it is the oldest Merkavah vision we know of from outside the canonical Scriptures. ... Indeed, one can consider this particular vision a model-vision of Merkavah Mysticism.” (AMM = Apocalyptic and Merkavah Mysticism—see below, page 4, 1980 • Gruenwald.) 2 On merkabah in gnostic works: (texts) “The Hypostasis of the Archons” and “On the Origin of the World,” in James M.

Arguments over the dating of this body of literature continue, but there is general agreement to a range of 200-800 C.E. The bounds and structure of these writings are also matters of dispute, for the notions of titles and fixed contents of a specific canon of hekhalot books appear to be more academic conveniences than reflections of the true nature or state of the literature. Since the ’seventies, scholarly work on the hekhalot texts has increased dramatically, as the publication dates on a clear majority of the books and articles discussed below attest. Before this spate of academic activity, there were in English little more than Gershom Scholem’s works4 and Hugo Odeberg’s attempt at a critical edition of one of the hekhalot texts5 to shed light on this oblique collection of writings. Even as this lament is being recalled, no time should be lost in acknowledging Scholem’s inescapable influence on this and all other aspects of the study of Jewish mysticism. Some of Scholem’s conclusions regarding the hekhalot have been challenged, and some of his observations on and characterizations of the hekhalot texts have come to seem convenient, imposing order on that which is, in fact, near chaos. Yet, Scholem’s writings on this subject remain some of the clearest and best supported; they are also among the most accessible, not only in their style but in their actual availability. As for Odeberg, his lone work is more problematic. As significant as it was, Odeberg’s treatment of Sefer ha-Hekhalot (BOOK OF THE HEKHALOT, dubbed by Odeberg “3 Enoch”) is now considered unreliable and misleading on many points. But, as contemporary scholar David Halperin has pointed out, Odeberg’s work has “proved easier to criticize than to emulate.”6   3 Mishnah: Megillah 4:10, Hagigah 2:7, Tosefta Hagigah 2:1-7, Palestinian Talmud 77 a-d; Babylonian Talmud 11b-16a. See the books listed below by 1980 • Halperin and 1982 • Chernus on page 5, and 2009 • Schäfer on page 20. 4 A list of Scholem’s works is given below, page 4. Morton Smith’s “Observations on Hekhalot Rabbati,” in Biblical and Other Studies, edited by Alexander Altmann (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1963) was another early notice. Also, Smith translated Hekhalot Rabbati into English—a project which began in the ’forties and lasted until the ’eighties, when Smith worked on the translation in collaboration with Ithamar Gruenwald. At some point, the typescript was corrected by Scholem, who mentions Smith’s translation in Jewish Gnosticism..., page 11, note 4. This translation circulated among a few scholars in the field but was never published.

Nevertheless, from the texts and studies now available in English, the persistent reader can certainly gain firm impressions of (i) the contents of the hekhalot texts, (ii) the issues captivating contemporary scholarship regarding the hekhalot texts, and (iii) the place of the hekhalot texts in the history and development of Judaism, early Christianity, and their mysticism.8 In the following pages, books, sections of books, and articles on merkabah mysticism and hekhalot literature—including translations—are described. I also discuss the various texts associated, however loosely, with the hekhalot corpus, with indications of sources for translations and studies of these.   7 For the most part in German, there is the work of Peter Schäfer and his team, Margarete Schlüter and Georg von Mutius. Certainly, the most significant work which Schäfer has overseen is Synopse zur Hekhalot-Literatur (Tübingen: J. C. B. Mohr [Paul Siebeck], 1981), which presents in the original Hebrew and Aramaic an array of manuscript readings side by side. Synopse was followed by Geniza-Fragmente zur Hekhalot-Literatur by the same team (Mohr/Siebeck: 1984). Soon after, German translations of Synopse appeared (Mohr/Siebeck, 1987 onward). Schäfer has also published a collection of his articles—ten in German, three in English—as Hekhalot-Studien (Mohr/Siebeck, 1988). 8 Refer to Ra‘anan S.

Through a Speculum That Shines: Vision and Imagination in Medieval Jewish Mysticism (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994) (hereafter SPECULUM) “This book ... is an attempt to treat in a comprehensive manner the problem of visionary experience in some of the main texts of the classical period of medieval Jewish mysticism. I have isolated the problem of vision and visualization since this constitutes one of the essential phenomenological concerns in the various mystical corpora produced by Jewish authors throughout history. I make no claim that mysticism is identical to or collapsible into the phenomenon of vision. I do, however, maintain that the examination of this issue provides an excellent speculum through which to view the religious experience of different Jewish mystics. While the major focus of this book, from a chronological perspective, is the High Middle Ages...(chapters 5 to 7), in chapter 3 I discuss the nature of the vision of the glory in the ancient Jewish mystical corpus known as the Hekhalot or Merkavah literature. The justification for including this chapter is both historical-textual and phenomenological.” (—page 9) [my ellipses—DK] After providing a summary of scholarship on hekhalot literature, CHAPTER 3, “Visionary Ascent and Enthronement in the Hekhalot Literature,” discusses the vision of God as presented therein, citing Hekhalot Rabbati most often. Wolfson explores problematic aspects—“The Paradox of Seeing the Hidden God,” eroticism, anthropomorphism—which bear upon the import of the texts: Did actual experiences determine the texts, or did the texts determine the experiences? Are the experiences themselves “real” or “imagined”? Does the hekhalot literature represent experience or exegesis? Are such distinctions useful in understanding the intent of the hekhalot authors? Through the chapter, Wolfson remains in dialogue with other scholars who have treated the hekhalot material—Scholem, Schäfer, and Halperin in particular. “From a phenomenological perspective as well, it is obvious that the Hekhalot corpus is an intrinsic part of such a study [i.e., of visionary experience in medieval Jewish mysticism], insofar as the vision of glory and the chariot served as a paradigm for visionary experience in later Jewish mysticism, influenced in particular...by the philosophical reinterpretations of this religious experience, as will be discussed in chapter 4 [“Theories of Glory and Visionary Experience in Pre-Kabbalistic Sources”]. To be sure, in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the various ‘trends’ of Jewish mysticism took shape in such a way that the chariot vision is hermeneutically transformed. It is nevertheless the case that the major mystical ideologies of the period to be discussed in this monograph, the German Pietists [CHAPTER 5: “Haside Ashakenaz: Verdical and Docetic [≈ “real” or “imagined”] Interpretations of the Chariot Vision”] and the Provençal-Spanish kabbalists of the theosophic trend [CHAPTERS 6 and 7, “Visionary Gnosis and the Role of the Imagination in Theosophic Kabbalah” and “The Hermeneutics of Visionary Experience: Revelation and Interpretation in the Zohar”] orient themselves in terms of the chariot. In that sense we can speak of these schools as hermeneutical transformations of the Hekhalot mysticism.” (—pages 9-10) [my brackets and ellipses—DK] Further, refer to Wolfson’s articles • “The Image of Jacob Engraved upon the Throne: Further Reflection on the Esoteric Doctrine of the German Pietists” = CHAPTER 1 of Along the Path: Studies in Kabbalistic Myth, Symbolism, and Hermeneutics (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1995)."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"20133    10• “Jewish Mysticism: A Philosophical Overview,” § MERKAVAH MYSTICISM, in History of Jewish Philosophy [ROUTLEDGE HISTORY OF WORLD PHILOSOPHIES – volume 2], edited by Daniel H.

Perhaps the most striking similarity is that they all are represented as the possessor of the Name of God, the concept of which plays an enormous role in Judaism. As the figure of Metatron appears to be some sort of systemization of and elaboration upon everything that was said about the principal angel in older sources, works outdating even John, it would seem that both Johannine and Gnostic Christology owe to mystical Judaism.” (INTRODUCTION, pages 3-4) • Kuyt, Annalies.

Part 2 examines merkabah mysticism in some detail to set up an analysis of its connections with Johannine mysticism. • Kraemer, Ross Shepard.

New York – Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998. “...Aseneth displays significant affinities with traditions about the adjuration of angels and ‘ascent’ to heavens as known to us from the problematic hekhalot and related materials. ... Given the nature of our sources, it seems impossible to know what if any actual connections might exist between Aseneth and hekhalot traditions. But if the longer version of Aseneth in particular does stand in some self-conscious relationship to the hekhalot traditions, gender may well be a significant factor in the differences.” (—When Aseneth Met Joseph, page 173) Refer especially to CHAPTER 4, “Aseneth and the Adjuration of Angels,” and CHAPTER 5, “Aseneth and Mystical Transformation in the Hekhalot Traditions.” Further, see Celia Deutsch, “Aseneth: Ascetical Practice, Vision, and Transformation,: in With Letters of Light: Studies in the Dead Sea Scrolls, Early Jewish Apocalypticism, Magic, and Mysticism in Honor of Rachel Elior [EKSTASIS: RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE FROM ANTIQUITY TO THE MIDDLE AGES, vol. 2], edited by Daphna V.

Leiden: Brill, 1999. “Within Merkabah mysticism, God is frequently depicted as an exalted and highly remote figure. Thus, Scholem was partly right when he described the gulf between humans and the God in Merkabah mysticism. Yet, Scholem erred when he emphasized the impossibility of closing this gulf—that is, when he defined the God of Merkabah mysticism as absolutely inaccessible or transcendent. How was the distance between human beings and God breached in Merkabah mysticism? The answer to this question requires an appreciation of the paradoxical nature of the angelic vice regent.” (—Guardians of the Gate, p. 9). Deutsch discusses Metatron in this role, with comments on Akatriel. He then examines similar figures in Gnosticism (Sabaoth) and Mandaeism (Abathur).

FROM THE SUNY PRESS CATALOGUE (Spring 2003): “While previous scholarship has demonstrated the connection between Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism and parallel traditions in Rabbinical writings, the Dead Sea Scrolls, apocalyptic, early Christian, and Gnostic sources, this work points out additional mythological traditions that resonate in this literature.

Oxford – Portland: The Littman Library of Jewish Civilization, 2004. Elior details the traditions and literature leading up to the hekhalot texts. She writes, Heikhalot literature preserves the living continuation of the sacred service by recovering it from the realm of space and time: the Temple/heikhal is lifted up to the heavens, and the priests serving therein become the ministering angels in the supernal Temples; the sacred service in these heavenly sanctuaries is described explicitly in terms of the rituals of the earthly Temple. This metamorphosis is implemented through the terminology of Merkavah mysticism, combining the hallowed memory of ritual with creative imagination and visionary inspiration, creating a bridge between the ‘revealed’ and the ‘hidden.’ (—INTRODUCTION, pages 14-15).

Alexander treats “Heikhalot Mysticism and Qumran” in CHAPTER 5, stating, ...comparison of Qumran mysticism with Heikhalot mysticism draws Qumran into the larger discipline of the study of Jewish mysticism, and puts it in a broader intellectual context. It is probably not unfair to say that the study of the Scrolls has been somewhat marginalized within the study of Judaism, and its significance underestimated by mainline Jewish Studies scholars (see Schiffman 1994 [Reclaiming the Dead Sea Scrolls—noted immediately below]). ... It is only recently that attempts have been made to integrate the Qumran evidence into the general history of Jewish mysticism (e.g., Elior 2004 [The Three Temples—noted above]). As we shall see, this evidence arguably challenges Scholem’s paradigm of Jewish mysticism [as in Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism—noted above], and forces a revision of it....

According to the testimony of Rabbi Eleazar of Worms, the termination of his family line, as a result of the early death of his son and combined with the diminution of his students, moved him to commit the secrets of the Torah to writing. The fear of the loss of the secret as a result of the diminution of the line of transmission justified the writing down of the secret; thus, the knowledge could be passed on without relying on the continuous chain of oral tradition.

PART ONE of Orlov’s study is an exhaustive (near 100-page) “Bibliography of the Slavonic Pseudepigrapha and Related Literature”; PART TWO, “Studies in Slavonic Pseudepigrapha,” “contains several [17] essays previously published in journals inaccessible to many interested readers” (page XI). In the introduction to the articles in PART TWO, Orlov writes It should be noted that 2Enoch, the Apocalypse of Abraham, and the Ladder of Jacob represent a unique group of texts that share a theophanic and mediatorial language that, in my view, is as different from the mainstream of early apocalyptic and pseudepigraphic writings as it is from later Hekhalot materials. This group of materials gives evidence of the lost practical and literary development that could very well represent an important transitional stage in early Jewish mystical testimonies, serving as a bridge from the matrix of early Jewish Apocalypticism, as it was manifested in early Enochic literature, to the matrix of early Jewish mysticism as it became manifest in rabbinic Merkabah and Hekhalot materials. The articles gathered in this volume intend to illustrate this transitional character of the Slavonic pseudepigraphic evidence by exploring theophanic and angelological imagery found in 2Enoch, the Ladder of Jacob, the Slavonic version of 3 Baruch and other pseudepigraphical texts preserved in Slavonic. It appears that the theophanic and angelological developments found in these documents occupy an intermediary stage between Second Temple Apocalypticism and Hekhalot mysticism and thus exhibit its own distinctive, one might say ‘proto-Hekhalot,’ mystical mold.

It is this gap between the Hebrew Bible and Merkavah mysticism that the present book wishes to address in a systematic and reflective manner.” (ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS—page XI) In his introduction, Schäfer surveys previous research on the forerunners of Merkavah mysticism, in particular the studies of Gershom Scholem and Rachel Elior (see above, 1965 • Jewish Gnosticism...etc., and 2004 • The Three Temples). He commences with Ezekiel (CHAPTER 1), then to the Enoch literature and related material (CHAPTERS 2 and 3). The section on Qumran (CHAPTER 4) addresses “Communion with Angels” while the section on Philo (CHAPTER 5) concentrates on “The Ascent of the Soul.” CHAPTER 6, “The Rabbis I,” takes up the “Cycle of Seven Stories” from the Tosefta (the four who entered pardes, Ben Zoma on the upper and lower waters, etc.); “The Rabbis II” (CHAPTER 7) discusses the Merkavah passages in YERUSHALMI and BAVLI (the same Hagigah sections discussed by Halperin—see above, 1980 • Merkabah in Rabbinic Literature).

ABSTRACT from Brill’s website: This book focuses on the additional liturgical and alternative readings of Targum Ezekiel, the so-called Targumic Toseftot. The critical text, translation, and commentary are presented with special reference to the long segments of unique mystical lore that are preserved in the Targumic Toseftot to Ezekiel 1, the chapter which describes the prophet’s vision of the celestial chariot. This unique manuscript material sheds light on a relatively dark chapter in the reception history of early Jewish mystical lore, being closely related to the Hekhalot literature, and to the Shi‛ur Qomah tradition in"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"20133    21particular. The volume concludes with a systematic treatment of the Targumic Toseftot to Ezekiel in relation to their Aramaic dialect, date and provenance, as well as their historical and social setting. Damsma takes up not only “The Order of the Heavens in Rabbinic Literature” but “The Order of the Underworlds...” as well. 2013 • Hekhalot Literature in Context, edited by Ra‘anan Boustan, Martha Himmelfarb, and Peter Schäfer [TEXTS & STUDIES IN ANCIENT JUDAISM, 153].

"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"20133    22Translations & References The Hekhalot Corpus The number of hekhalot texts in translation has grown, albeit slowly, over the years, culminating with James R. Davila’s Hekhalot Literature in Translation: Major Texts of Merkavah Mysticism (2013—see above, page 21), which includes all of the major works except • 3 Enoch, deferring to P. S. Alexander’s “excellent English translation”—Davila, page 7—in Charlesworth’s Old Testament Pseudepigrapha; • Masekhet Hekhalot, in that “it is doubtful that this text should be included in the Hekhalot corpus”—ibid., page 9; • the Shi‘ur Qomah corpus, given that “its relationship to the other Hekhalot texts is somewhat tangential”—ibid., referring the reader to the work on Shi‘ur Qomah by Martin Cohen. Here we enter directly into the question of what is and what is not a member of the hekhalot family; the canons offered by various scholars differ. For instance, Schäfer’s Synopse includes some items which many commentators find dubious, namely, THE SWORD OF MOSES and Seder Rabba di Bereshit. One well-known text, THE VISIONS OF EZEKIEL, while almost always included on lists of hekhalot texts, is clearly of a character different from the so-called “core group.” Davila’s exclusion of Masekhet Hekhalot from the canon is certain to draw some criticism.9 Discussions on which texts belong to the hekhalot canon have progressed along several lines: 1. Texts which have long been counted among the hekhalot are now thought not to belong, for example, THE VISIONS OF EZEKIEL. 2. Magical works, such as THE SWORD OF MOSES and Sefer ha-Razim, are being drawn closer to the hekhalot. 3. Some works are being wholly reconsidered in that they might not be works at all but rather of one genre or another, as, for instance, the Shi’ur Qomah and Sar Torah texts. As mentioned already, even the titles of these “books” are late inventions which have become conventions, used even by the scholars who refute their validity. Drawing on the lists of hekhalot given by a number of contemporary scholars, below is a reference outline of sources on various hekhalot titles, erring in favor of inclusion.   9 Masekhet Hekhalot is a mixture of hekhalot and other materials, which its author/compiler blends and alters rather freely.

Hekhalot Zutreti, OR Zutarti [THE LESSER PALACES] (HZ) {§§ 335-374, 407-419} Editions and Translations: Two editions of HZ in the original Hebrew and Aramaic have appeared (i) Schäfer’s Synopse, and (ii) a problematic “critical edition” by Rachel Elior (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, Hebrew University, 1982). For a review of these two editions, see David Halperin’s “A New Edition of the Hekhalot Literature,” in Journal of the American Oriental Society, vol. 104, no. 3 (1984). Christopher R. A. Morray-Jones offers “A Version of Hekhalot Zutarti”—in English—in The Mystery of God: Early Jewish Mysticism and the New Testament (Leiden – Boston: Brill, 2009—detailed above, 2009 • Rowand/Morray-Jones), stating (pages 268-9) The version of HekhZ that follows includes all of the material included by both Schäfer and Elior (§§ 335-374 and 407-419) plus § 375 (included by Elior but not by Schäfer) and the Akiva ‘postscript’ (422-424). § 347 (MS. Munich 40 only), where the copyist has mistakenly repeated the first words of § 337, is disregarded. Owing to the redactional complexity of the HekhZ macroform, it cannot be claimed that this version represents an ‘original’ or ‘authoritative’ text of HekhZ. Schäfer’s contention that no such text ever existed is basically correct. It is therefore necessary to take account of the different sources and layers of literary activity found in the manuscripts, including the distinctive literary tradition represented by passages of MS. New York. It can, however, be said that the materials included in this version are the basic ingredients of the early HekhZ literary tradition, that they were amalgamated with each other in something like this form during the early centuries of the common era, and that at least some of the materials preserved in this collection must be very old indeed. In Transparent Illusion, Morray-Jones’ analyzes in detail two sections of HZ: the “ancient midrash ... which includes the water vision episode” (§§ 407-412) in CHAPTER THREE, and the “throne midrash” (§§ 368-375) in CHAPTER EIGHT, section 2.   10 Davila, in Hekhalot Literature..., pp. 38, 40, and 189) refers to §§ 489-495 simply as “an Aramaic magical handbook.”"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"20133    25HZ in English is also in James Davila’s Hekhalot Literature in Translation.

Beraita d’Niddah [TEACHING OF THE MENSTRUANT] (BdN) In Forsaken: The Menstruant in Medieval Jewish Mysticism (Waltham: Brandeis University Press: 2011), Sharon Faye Koren writes (page 36), Saul Lieberman was the first scholar to associate the strict purity laws of the BdN with the legal philosophy formulated in Hekhalot literature, and Michael Stone [Scholastic Magic, pages 182-185] and Rebecca Lesses [Ritual Practices, pages 134-144] have noted a connection between the BdN and the ascetic rituals requires for Sar Torah adjurations. I believe that there is an even stronger connection. The BdN not only informs the ascetic rituals in some Hekhalot texts but also independently reflects a mystical consciousness. The authors of traditions in the BdN, like the authors of Hekhalot literature, were trying to discover a viable spiritual solution to a Judaism without a Temple. In Hekhalot Literature in Translation, James Davila includes a chapter on shorter hekhalot texts (“Some Shorter Macroforms”) which “may be counted as macroforms in their own right” (—Davila, page 350).

Certainly, the convenient notion of a neat separation between ascent texts and magic texts can no longer be sustained. Of late, the tendency among scholars is to dismiss such loaded terms as “magic” (a negative term—vs “theurgy” or “religion,” positive terms) and “mysticism” to concentrate on the methods and aims of Jewish, usually along with early Christian and pagan (Greco-Roman), rituals and how these reflect the mindset and beliefs of their eras. On this trend, see, for example, Rebecca Macy Lesses’ Ritual Practices to Gain Power (summary statement on pages 11-13), James R. Davila’s Descenders to the Chariot (CHAPTER 2 discusses the difficulties of the words “mysticism,” “magic,” and “shamanism”), and Naomi Janowitz’ Icons of Power (INTRODUCTION).

Karr (Ithaca: KoM #5, 1985), pages 17-20, are shown in brackets. 1. Merkabah mysticism is the name of a mystical movement within Judaism’s Talmudic and Gaonic Periods (ca. 100-1000 c. e.). This school produced what is called the Hekhalot literature. 2. This mysticism, ma’aseh merkabah (work of the chariot), is mentioned in the Mishna itself (in Hagigah 2:1): The work of creation (ma’aseh bereshit) may not be expounded in the presence of two or more. The description of the chariot (merkabah) may not be expounded even in the presence of one, unless he is a sage who already understands out of his own insights. (quoted from Lipman, Eugene. THE MISHNAH, ORAL TEACHING OF JUDAISM. [New York:] Schocken, 1974, p. 150) 3. Implied in this quote is that merkabah mysticism, though guarded, was not outside of the rabbinic tradition. One gets the impression that it was even thought of as the supreme mystery. 4. Just as the work of creation comprised mystical speculation on the first part of Genesis, work of the chariot comprised mystical speculation on, and amplification of, the first chapter of Ezekiel. 5. The literature of this school describes the mystical journey through various heavens and palaces (hekhalot) leading to the ultimate vision of the throne and chariot, and, in some cases, “the figure in the form of a man” (Ezekiel 1:26). "},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"20133    426. It is not the purpose of this short paper to go into detail about the development of the merkabah school or the contents of the Hekhalot texts. To a greater extent than I am capable, this work has already been done. My purpose is to inform the reader of where to look for information on the various facets of study pertaining to merkabah mysticism. I have limited myself to English sources. 7. Historical and scholarly overviews: as it is with any study in the field of Jewish mysticism, the best place to start the investigation of merkabah mysticism is in the works of Gershom Scholem. Two of his works give excellent synopses of the subject: MAJOR TRENDS IN JEWISH MYSTICISM (1941, Schocken repr.) Lecture 2. Merkabah Mysticism and Jewish Gnosticism. KABBALAH (1974, Meridian repr.) pp. 8-21, and article: Merkabah Mysticism, pp. 373-6. For a closer look at some of the topics and scholarly concerns in merkabah mysticism, see Scholem’s JEWISH GNOSTICISM, MERKABAH MYSTICISM, AND TALMUDIC TRADITION (1965, Jewish Theological Seminary). KABBALAH (as above), articles: Chiromancy, pp. 317-9. Meditation, pp. 369-72. Metatron, pp. 377-81. [Add to these Gruenwald, Ithamar. APOCALYPTIC AND MERKAVAH MYSTICISM (1980, E. J. Brill).] 8. There are a few articles and one book that analyze the connections of merkabah mysticism with the rabbinic (i.e. Talmudic, etc.) tradition: [Bokser, Ben Zion. THE JEWISH MYSTICAL TRADITION 1981 Pilgrim Press) Chapter 2. The Talmud. Talmudic “work of the chariot” segments are translated and introduced.] [Halperin, David J.

Four versions of the story of Yohanan ben Zakkai and the merkabah-sermon of his disciple Eleazer ben Arakh are presented and compared to demonstrate that such a story accumulates more and more detail as it passes from earlier to later versions. 9. In JEWISH GNOSTICISM... Scholem lists eight texts belonging to the Hekhalot literature. I shall list them here, adding one (Shiur Qoma), indicating research sources, if any exist: a) The Visions of Ezekiel, a mystical midrash on Ezekiel 1:1, see: Jacobs, Louis. JEWISH MYSTICAL TESTIMONIES (1977, Schocken) Chapter Three: The Riders of the Chariot and Those Who Enter the Heavenly Halls. Introduction and text of Visions... Marmorstein, A. A Fragment of the Visions of Ezekiel, in JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW, New Series #8 (1917-18). Translation and discussion. b) The Lesser Hekhalot, possibly the oldest. In English, there are only spot translations in Scholem’s JEWISH GNOSTICISM... and MAJOR TRENDS... c) The Greater Hekhalot, the best covered of the texts for our purposes. Besides spot translations (see Scholem as listed in b) there are Blumenthal, David R.

The Recall of Rabbi Nehuniah ha-Qanah from Ecstasy in the Hekhlaot Rabbati, in AJS REVIEW vol I, 1976. In Hekhalot Rabbati, R.

Smith has translated The Greater Hekhalot in its entirety, but it has not been published. Indeed, it exists, as far as I know, in typescript, with corrections jotted in the margins and scribbled over the text by Gershom Scholem.) d) Merkabah Rabbah. I know of no English sources for this. e) A titleless Hekhalot. Scholem gives a transcription of this text in Hebrew in an appendix to JEWISH GNOSTICISM..., but I know of no other sources for information on this. f) Chapter on physiognomics and chiromancy, published in Hebrew by Scholem, but no English translation. See, however, Scholem’s article: Chiromancy in KABBALAH. g) Book of the Hekhalot, called also 3 Enoch or the Hebrew Book of Enoch. One of the latest of the texts.
