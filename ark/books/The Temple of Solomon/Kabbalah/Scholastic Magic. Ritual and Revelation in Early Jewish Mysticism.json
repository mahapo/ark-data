I believe that the Hekhalot literature constitutes important evidence for the range of social and cultural groups within rabbinic society. In my reading in the social sciences and the history of religions, I have also become convinced that ritual and mystical texts can best be understood by paying close atten­tion to their specifically cultural background; my book Mystical Prayer in Ancient Judaism reflects this conviction. Several years ago, it occurred to me that it would be fruitful to analyze two elements in Hekhalot literature that could be indicators of its authors' relationship to society: ritual, which can tell us much about the mythic universe of its authors, and which can also give us clues about how they stood in relation to the rabbinic hala-khah; and concepts of tradition and authority, which can help us under­stand their social position and self-conception. It seemed to me that analyzing these factors could be a way of testing the thesis that Merkavah mysticism derived from the circles of the early rabbis against internal evidence. In the course of gathering the evidence for such a study, I came to realize that these factors, ritual and tradition, were concentrated primarily in one strand of Hekhalot literature, the Sar-Torah and related texts. Be­cause I believe that the study of ideas in Hekhalot literature begins with literary analysis of the texts themselves, I decided to focus on these texts. This led me to a consideration of the Sar-Torah phenomenon itself, and a wish to understand its own concerns and background, and in turn to the themes of revelation, memory, and the relationship of magic to the scho­lastic ethic. This book thus became not only a study in the social back­ground of ancient Jewish mysticism, but an exploration into forgotten aspects of ritual and revelation in the rabbinic milieu.

Ancient and medieval people reserved their awe for memory. Their greatest geniuses they describe as people of superior memories, they boast unashamedly of their prowess in that faculty, and they regard it as a mark of superior moral character as well as intellect. —Mary J. Carruthers, The Book of Memory THIS BOOK is a story of imagination in the service of memory, of magic in the service of scholasticism. In the visionary literature of the talmudic pe­riod, there are several texts that concern the conjuration of an angel known as the Sar-Torah, the \"Prince of the Torah.\" This angel is said to bestow upon a person an extraordinary memory, prodigious skill in ab­sorbing what he has learned, and esoteric knowledge of the cosmos and heaven. Most of the texts are stories of how ancient sages conjured that angel, who transformed them into great rabbis. Those secrets, say the texts, are available to the reader, who can become as learned as they merely by following the rabbis' magical instructions. Like the intellectuals in Mary Carruthers's study of memory in the Mid­dle Ages,1 rabbinic Jews in ancient Palestine and Babylonia revered sages whose authority and holiness lay in their ability to memorize and retain sacred law and lore. The Sar-Torah literature can tell us about how these values influenced the popular religion, magic, and pneumatic spirituality of the time. These texts also play an important role in the history of Judaism in late antiquity, and can help us understand who the ancient Jewish mys­tics were. The Sar-Torah traditions are set into a remarkable corpus of Hebrew and Aramaic texts known as the Hekhalot literature. This literature, which has received a great deal of attention in recent years, took shape in Pal-1 Mary J.

It is preserved mostly in medieval manuscript traditions stemming from Germany, Italy, and the Middle East. The best-known texts in this corpus are pseudepigra-phic accounts of the ascent of a second-century rabbi, usually Rabbi Ish-mael or Rabbi Akiba, through the chambers of Heaven, the Hekhalot, to the chariot-throne of God, the Merkavah. Many of these texts are based on the visions of the heavenly throne depicted in the books of Ezekiel and Isaiah.2 Also prominent in the corpus, however, are texts, such as the Sar-Torah literature, about the cultivation of angels who bring practical bene­fits to people on earth. We are only beginning to understand the significance of Hekhalot litera­ture for the history of religions. It is of value to students of religious phe­nomena and behavior because of its place in the history and study of rabbinic Judaism and Jewish thought, and because of the distinctive con­ceptual and literary problems it presents. Little is known about the social environment of the rabbinic estate in late antiquity. Hekhalot literature is evidence for trends and groups within Jewish society who were related to that of the founders and leaders of rabbinic Judaism in complex ways. Moreover, its peculiar variations on rabbinic theology, ritual, and scholas­tic values can shed light on the worldview of those rabbis. This study is an exploration of central themes in Hekhalot literature— Torah and wisdom, tradition and authority, and the ritual process— through an analysis of the Sar-Torah and related texts. Its aim is to find out what these texts can tell us about the social and historical context of their authors, and to demonstrate how culture, tradition, and society operate in mystical and magical systems. In the course of this enterprise, we shall uncover aspects of ancient Judaic thinking that this literature reveals. APPROACHES TO HISTORY Alasdair Maclntyre, in the opening pages of After Virtue, asks us to imag­ine a cataclysm in which all the works of scientific progress had been destroyed, leaving only a few scattered, fragmentary documents.3 The so­ciety living in its aftermath would try to reconstruct the sciences from the remaining fragments, and eventually convince themselves that what they had developed were, in fact, those sciences. Maclntyre likens that scenario to the relationship of contemporary moral philosophers to their moral tra-2 On the relationship of Hekhalot literature to interpretations of Ezekiel see David J. Halperin, Faces of the Chariot: Early Jewish Responses to Ezekiel's Vision (Tubingen: Mohr, 1988); on this work see below. 3 Alasdair Maclntyre, After Virtue: A Study in Moral Theory (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1981), 1-5."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MENTALITIES OF ANCIENT JUDAISM 5 dition:\"What we possess, if this view is true, are the fragments of a concep­tual scheme, parts which now lack those contexts from which their signifi­cance derived.\"4 MacIntyre bases his moral argument on a historical one. The moral ar­gument is that to understand the sources of moral life that our society values it is necessary to reconstruct their cultural context. The historical argument is that the complex cultures that modern Western civilization considers to be its heritage are known to us only fragmentarily since the Enlightenment. This study is concerned with the historical issue implied in Maclntyre's scenario rather than the moral one. If we wish to understand the religious ideas of premodern civilizations such as that of ancient Juda­ism, we must be prepared to reconstruct the cultural universe that those cultures inhabited, in all their apparent familiarity and alienness. This exer­cise is important, for while the historical study of rabbinic Judaism and its environment has preoccupied scholars for more than two centuries, we do not always question certain basic assumptions we have about the way an­cient Jews thought. Historians have recognized this larger problem for several decades, and its implications have penetrated most fields of historical research. Many historians look to the social sciences to ask whether the cultures we study differed from ours in fundamental ways of thinking. In the study of re­ligion, this has meant increased attention to cultural anthropology for methodological models. In the study of classical and medieval history, this has given rise to what is called the histoire des mentalites, in which historical sources, including literary texts and archival documents, are studied not only for political and intellectual history but for information about basic facts of everyday life, including rituals, popular physiology and psychology, and the subtleties of social distinctions.5 This method stresses that the study of history requires the discovery of the assumptions governing those societies that we do not share. Two ways in which this program can be carried out are of interest to us here. In one type of study, a single figure, incident, or cultural norm is investigated in order to decode its conceptual background. Interesting ex­amples can be found in Robert Darnton's collection of essays, The Great Cat Massacre.6 Here portraits of individual events or texts—a bizarre riot in a print shop, a set of fairy tales—are deciphered for what they say about 4 Ibid., 2. 5 For general considerations of this approach, see Jacques Le Goff, \"Les Mentalites, une histoire ambigue,\" in Faire de I'histoire: nouveaux problemes, ed.

These studies are influenced by, among others, Clifford Geertz's interpretive approach to the study of cul­ture.7 They often focus on a single detail that seems strange to the modern reader. As Darnton explains, \"When we cannot get a proverb, or a joke, or a ritual, or a poem, we know we are on to something. By picking at the document where it is most opaque, we may be able to unravel an alien system of meaning.\"8 In the second type of study, by no means unrelated to the first, a perva­sive element of a premodern society that had previously been neglected is brought to the foreground. Influential, if controversial, examples of this approach are Phillip Aries's studies of ideas of childhood9 and death in the Middle Ages.10 Another example, from a rather different perspective, is Mary Carruthers's work on memory quoted above. A prominent recent example of the influence of this approach on the study of late antiquity is Peter Brown's The Body and Society, in which he frames early Christian attitudes toward the body and virginity within Greco-Roman physiologi­cal conceptions of male and female. For this background Brown relies on ancient medical literature as well as conventional sources of intellectual history.11 This study seeks to draw from both of these approaches. It is an account of one phenomenon and literary corpus that represents wider, more perva­sive aspects of ancient Judaism. In it, we find the conjunction of memory and magic, two cultural modes that permeated ancient and medieval Med­iterranean and Jewish civilizations, the importance of which has only re­cently been recognized. How can the study of the social and cultural environment of rabbinic Judaism make use of this strategy? One way to do so is to examine a phe­nomenon in which seemingly disparate elements are juxtaposed. Such jux-7 For the anthropologists that influence this approach, see Darnton, Great Cat Massacre, 283-84.

This literature also bears on two aspects of classical Judaism that deserve reexamination: the role of ritual and what it implies about the efficacy of religious action, and the nature of the scholastic praxis that lies behind the intellectual pro­cess the rabbis call Torah. Each of these issues plays a central role in how rabbinic Judaism has been perceived. Ritual action, codified in halakhah, has long been recognized as essential to rabbinic Judaism. So, too, the study and transmission of Torah are understood to be at the heart of the rabbinic enterprise. Yet Jewish ritual can go beyond the requirements of halakhah, and the act of studying Torah is not as simple as it might sound. The Sar-Torah literature sheds a distinctive light upon these elements of rabbinic Judaism. The Sar-Torah texts describe rituals that draw from cen­tral rabbinic norms regarding purity and liturgy, but also attest to religious goals and mythic dynamics that seem to be at odds with those norms. The texts also invoke tradition for their validation, in peculiar variations of the rabbinic concept of tradition. We can use those variations to illuminate the nature of rabbinic claims to authority. Moreover, these texts apply their magic to the central rabbinic activity—the study of Torah. By seeing what it is that Torah entails according to this tradition, we can discover unfamil­iar dimensions of this essential idea. RABBINIC MYSTICISM? Although the historical program described above has increasingly in­formed the study of ancient Judaism,13 Gershom Scholem's monumental 12 The concept of defamiliarization is used by Victor Shklovsky, \"Art as Technique,\" in Russian Formalist Criticism: four Essays, ed.

Before Scholem and a few of his contemporaries brought legitimacy to the historical study of Jewish mysticism, the subject was often dismissed as bizarre, irrational, and foreign to true Judaism.14 Scholem and his colleagues showed that it was impossible to understand Jewish cultural history without recognizing the extent to which mystical theology and hermeneutics pervaded ancient and medieval Judaism. The study of Merkavah mysticism has played a key role in this argument. Until Scholem rescued the Hekhalot texts from obscurity several decades ago,15 they languished in medieval manuscripts and anthologies of minor midrashim.16 Although nineteenth-century scholars had written about this literature, treating it mainly as an example of an esoteric trend outside the normative Judaism of the early Middle Ages,17 Scholem assigned it a key place in the history of Judaic thought. Here, he maintained, was the first significant stage in the history of Jewish mysticism. This phenomenon, which came to be known as Merkavah mysticism, represented according to Scholem the mystical discipline of cultivating a vision of the divine throne, reached by travel—known as \"ascent\" or \"descent\"18—through the seven Hekhalot, the heavenly palaces or temples. Furthermore, this literature is investigates an aspect of medieval Jewish society that was at once pervasive and influential yet often taken for granted by historians, see Kanarfogel, Jewish Education. 14 On earlier historians' conceptions of Jewish mysticism and Scholem's historical argu­ment, see David Biale, Gershom Scholem: Kabbalah and Counter-History (Cambridge: Har­vard University Press, 1979). To be sure, before Scholem there were nineteenth- and twentieth-century scholars who treated Jewish mysticism as a subject for serious historical study. See, for example, Paul Vulliaud, La Kabbalah juive: historie et doctrine, 2 vols. (Paris: E. Nourry, 1923); Adolph Jellinek, Beitrage zur Geschichte der Kabbalah (1852; reprint, New York: Arno, 1980); and A.

In fact, Scholem argued, Merkavah mysticism derives from the central circles of the ancient rabbis, the tannaim and amoraim of the first centuries C.E.19 Scholem thus placed the Hekhalot literature on the agenda both for students of the phenomenology of religion and historians of ancient Juda­ism. If the Hekhalot texts were composed by the most important rabbis of the early talmudic period, the history of rabbinic thought needed to be rewritten. If they were evidence for mystical theology and practices, the student of religion had to account for their peculiar language, pseudepig-raphic attributions, and other cultural properties. In recent years the study of Hekhalot literature has grown considerably. Due to new editions of the corpus and new textual methods for dealing with rabbinic and cognate literatures, the nature of this literature has been the subject of debate. This discussion bears on both the historical and phenomenological issues Scholem raised. HISTORICAL ISSUES With increased interest in Hekhalot literature, Scholem's theories about its historical origins have undergone reexamination. The most important de­velopment has been the research of Peter Schafer, who through his Synopse zur Hekhalot-Litemtur and other publications has prompted a renewed inquiry into the literary and historical character of Hekhalot literature.20 In addition, David Halperin's form-critical analysis of passages in rabbinic literature about the Merkavah has shown that the texts considered to be evidence for the practice of ecstatic mysticism by the early rabbis do not support such a conclusion.21 Studies by Martin S. Cohen, P. S. Alexander, and this writer have shown that individual Hekhalot texts cannot be dated in their entirety to the first centuries of the common era, but were the result of a process of evolution that spanned the centuries from early amor-aic Palestine to post-talmudic Babylonia.22 These studies arise from close, 19 Scholem, Major Trends, 44; idem, Jewish Gnosticism, 8. 20 Peter Schafer, Synopse zur Hekhalot-Literatur (Tiibingen: Mohr, 1981); idem, Geniza-Fragmente zur Hekhalot-Literatur (Tubingen: Mohr, 1984). On the implications of these publications for the study of Hekhalot literature, see below. The Hekhalot texts of the Syn-opse are translated in Peter Schafer, Ubersetzung zur Hekhalot-Literatur (Tubingen: Mohr, 1987-91). 21 David J. Halperin, The Merkavah in Rabbinic Literature (New Haven: American Ori­ental Society, 1983). Halperin's thesis builds on an earlier article by E. E.

They emphasize using internal evidence for the historical theses advanced, and make use of recent developments in the methodology of reading rabbinic and related literature, such as form criticism. They also pay attention to the difficult textual problems this literature presents. If it is no longer certain that the Hekhalot literature as we know it goes back to a mystical tradition at the center of the rabbinic movement, it remains to be determined how to place its authors. It is generally agreed that they were not members of any organized antirabbinic sect known to us; they attributed their texts to the ancient rabbis and are familiar with many details of rabbinic exegesis and law. There is litde external evidence for their place in Jewish society.23 Therefore we must rely on the texts to help us address those questions. This effort, which in part animates this study, also must be seen in the context of a larger discussion of the social history of rabbinic Judaism. Contemporary historians have tended to look at the rabbinic period in two basic ways. One, following a more traditional type of historiography, tends to see rabbinic Judaism, as expounded in the Babylonian and Pales­tinian Talmuds and classical midrashim, as a single culture and as the reli­gion of nearly all Jews in ancient Palestine and Babylonia.24 Another view, one of the earliest proponents of which was Erwin R. Goodenough, was to see rabbinic Judaism as the product of an isolated elite with limited cul­tural influence on Jews outside of the academy.25 Both views, however, presume a two-tiered model of Jewish society in Texts and Recensions (Tubingen: Mohr, 1985); P. Alexander, \"3 (Hebrew Apocalypse of) Enoch,\" in The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha 1, ed. James H. Charlesworth (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1983), 223-315, idem, \"3 Enoch and the Talmud,\" JSJ18 (1987): 40-68; and Michael D. Swartz, Mystical Prayer in Ancient Judaism: An Analysis of Ma'aseh Merkavah (Tubingen: Mohr, 1992). Halperin, Faces of the Chariot, advances an extensive argument against Scholem's thesis that ecstatic throne-mysticism was practiced by the early rabbis. Scholem's view is accepted by Gruenwald, Apocalyptic and Merkavah Mysticism (Leiden: Brill, 1980), and Meir Bar-Ilan, Sitre Tefillah ve-Hekhalot (Ramat Gan: Bar-Ilan University Press, 1987); cf. C. R. A. Morray-Jones, \"Hekhalot literature and Talmudic Tra­dition: Alexander's Three Test Cases,\" JSJ22 (1991): 1-39. 23 Talmudic texts relevant to the phenomenon are analyzed in Halperin, Merkavah in Rabbinic Literature. An important responsum by the eleventh-century rabbinic leader Hai Gaon is discussed in Chapter 6. Another early witness is the tenth-century Karaite Salmon b. Yeruhim's anti-rabbanite polemic, published in Israel Davidson, The Book of the Wars of the Lord (New York: Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1934), which includes a diatribe against the Sar-Torah myth; on this text see Halperin, Faces of the Chariot, 518-22. 24 See, for example, Ephraim E.

Recently, though, there has been increased recogni­tion that ancient Palestinian and Babylonian Jewish societies were complex ones, encompassing tensions between circles within the rabbinic estate, and between the academy and other sectors of the population.26 This more nuanced view of ancient Jewish society mirrors recent research into social dynamics of Western religions in late antiquity and the Middle Ages, in which the earlier picture of inert \"elite\" and \"popular\" religions is revised.27 Hekhalot literature plays an interesting part in this debate, although its implications have not always been made explicit. Because Scholem saw Merkavah mysticism as a phenomenon at the heart of rabbinic Judaism, it was seen as the esoteric spiritual expression of the academy. By this ac­count, many of the great leaders of the early talmudic period practiced visionary mysticism as they were ruling on matters of civil and ritual law.28 But this notion has been disputed by many current scholars. Scholem's 26 Although Jacob Neusner does not examine the evidence for other classes in Jewish society in the talmudic period, he is a major advocate of seeing rabbinic literature as indica­tive of several \"Judaisms\" and not of a piece. Among his vast oeuvre, see Neusner ,Judaism: The Evidence of the Mishnah (Chicago: Chicago University Press, 1981). The existence of tensions between the Babylonian academies and the Exilarchate is described in Neusner, Babylonia, and Isaiah M.

As stated above, it has been questioned whether this evidence in fact supports his conclusions.29 A key argument from internal evidence was that passages in Hekhalot literature—especially a story in Hekhalot Rab-bati about the deposition of Rabbi Nehuniah ben ha-Qannah from heaven —demonstrate detailed knowledge of rabbinic halakhah.30 Yet when this and related passages are examined, a more complex picture emerges, in which rituals in Hekhalot literature vary in subtle but important ways from their halakhic counterparts.31 The most direct recent challenge to Scholem's thesis that Merkavah mysticism constituted the spirituality of an early rabbinic elite has come from David J. Halperin. In his important work Faces of the Chariot, Hal-perin builds upon his earlier conclusion that tannaitic sources do not sup­port Scholem's early dating of Merkavah mysticism.32 Halperin calls into question the picture of an ancient rabbinic elite whose exoteric, legal activ­ity hid an esoteric, visionary praxis of ascent to heaven. His alternative explanation is that this literature was the product of the Am ha-'Ares, the lower classes of rabbinic society, and served as a protest against rabbinic authority.33 While designating the authors as Am ha-'Ares does alert us to the possibility that they were not the central shapers of rabbinic Judaism, there is still much to learn about the context of the literature. It should be remembered that the term Am ha-'Ares is a product not of sociological analysis but of an internal rabbinic taxonomy that determined social loca­tion according to observance and study of halakhah.34 Moreover, Hekhalot texts reflect varying degrees of education and sophistication, in­dicating that their authors may not have come only from the lower classes.35 Peter Schafer, on the other hand, has suggested recently that the liter­ature was the product of a \"post-Rabbinic elite.\"36 It is probable that 29 See n. 21 above. 30 Scholem ,Jewish Gnosticism, 9-13; cf. Saul Lieberman, \"The Knowledge of Halakha by the Author (or Authors) of the Heikhaloth,\" in Gruenwald, Apocalyptic, 241-244. 31 See Chapter 6. 32 Cf. Halperin, Merkavah in Rabbinic Literature, and Urbach, iiHa-Masoret.\" 33 See Halperin, Faces of the Chariot, 382-83. 34 See Levine, Rabbinic Class, 112-17, on the variety of rabbinic attitudes to the 'Am ha-'Ares, and 117-27 on the rabbis' relationships with other social groups; cf. also Aharon Oppenheimer, The 'Am Ha-aretz (Leiden: Brill, 1977). 35 See also Martha Himmelfarb, review of Halperin, Faces of the Chariot, Critical Review of Books in Religion (1990), 342. 36 See Peter Schafer, \"The Aim and Purpose of Early Jewish Mysticism,\" in Hekhalot-Studien (Tubingen: Mohr, 1988), 293; cf. idem, Hidden and Manifest God (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1992), 159.

However, it is unclear who composed and transmitted the literature before them. An interesting approach to this issue was taken by Gerd Wewers in an article analyzing the introduction to Hekhalot Rabbati, one of the most important Hekhalot texts.38 This introduction claims far-reaching powers for the person who learns the Hekhalot Rabbati tradition. Wewers con­cludes that the authors of the hymns were educated Jews who saw them­selves as an elite with social and thaumaturgic powers. However, Wewers advises caution in extrapolating from this self-conception to the actual social situation of the authors.39 Wewers's program—of examining the self-image of the authors through testimonies such as the introduction to Hekhalot Rabbati—is a useful one. This study takes a similar approach by analyzing evidence for attitudes to authority and tradition in the corpus. However, this study suggests that when we examine how some of the authors and redactors who received this literature wished to use it, their relationship to halakhah and the rabbinic ethos, and the social function of their use of ideal figures, we cannot fully support either the view that these passages were written by an elite or that they are the product of a lower class of cAm ha-'Ares. These findings suggest that there are social and historical dimensions to the evidence for Judaic society in late antiquity that deserve to be explored if we are to arrive at a more complete picture of ancient Judaism. PHENOMENOLOGICAL ISSUES As we have seen, Merkavah mysticism gained importance in the study of ancient Judaism through Scholem's description of it as the first significant manifestation of Jewish mysticism. But to characterize Hekhalot literature as mystical is to enter an ongoing debate that concerns not only Jewish mysticism, but the study of mysticism in general. Several of its literary and other segments of the community well into Geonic times. Thus tensions between rabbinic leadership and other groups could have continued past the time of the redaction of the Talmud. 37 On dating of Hekhalot texts see Swartz, Mystical Prayer, 216-20, and the studies cited there; Schafer, Hidden and Manifest God, 8, suggests a relative dating of Hekhalot texts that indicates a range from the late talmudic period to well into the Geonic era. 38 Gerd Wewers, \"Der Oberlegenheit des Mystikers: Zur Aussage der Gedulla-Hymnen in Hekhalot Rabbati 1,2-2,3,\"/S/17 (1986): 3-22.

Is mystical literature primarily a literary rendering of ineffable experi­ence, or are literary convention and activity primary to the phenomenon? Is the mystic a type of anarchist, subverting convention and going against society's grain, or a traditionalist, bound by conventional pieties? Hekha-Iot literature, with its striking descriptions of visions, its emphasis on the individual's encounter with God and divine beings, and its numinous poetry, presents an interesting case study in these questions. The Sar-Torah literature is relevant to this debate because of its focus on ritual, its conceptions of tradition and society, and its conception of knowl­edge that is at once esoteric and practical. Moreover, the Sar-Torah phe­nomenon is intimately bound up with the literature and phenomenology of Jewish magic. The study of magic has come to play a key role in our understanding of religions in antiquity. The study of the Greek magical papyri, the development of ideas of theurgy in late antiquity, and the status of magic and healing practices in early Christianity have shown the Greco-Roman world to be a place infused with magical conceptions at all levels of society.40 Rabbinic literature as well abounds in concepts that can be called magical; many of the talmudic sages were known as holders of powerful ritual and angelological secrets. Recent research on Jewish magical texts from late antiquity and the early Middle Ages has amplifed this picture considerably, by showing how Jewish magicians themselves saw the cos­mos, their place in it, and their clients' needs. Because its magic is applied largely to the memorization and acquisition of sacred knowledge, the Sar-Torah literature also bears on the question of the social and behavioral context of knowledge in societies informed by scholasticism. Indeed, it is a premise of this study that we cannot under­stand the substance of a culture's sacred teachings—Torah, in the case of ancient Judaism—unless we understand how that substance is conveyed through prescribed patterns of behavior, social institutions, and the ad­vancement of an ethos. This premise is implied in the use of the term scholasticism in this study. In the following, each of these elements—mysticism, magic, and scholas­ticism—is discussed. Then the study of the Sar-Torah literature is described. 40 The study of Greco-Roman magic has flourished considerably in recent years; see espe­cially Hans Dieter Betz, The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation Including the Demotic Spells 1 (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1986); Christopher A. Faraone and Dirk Obbink, eds., Magika Hiera: Ancient Greek Magic and Religion (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991); John G.

A major step in clarifying this question was taken by Scholem in his discussion of the concept of mysticism in Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism. There he observed that \"there is no mysticism as such, only the mysticism of a particular religious system.\"43 Scholem also stressed that mysticism cannot be confined to the element of inner experience, and is more often than not grounded in the adherent's traditional faith.44 This point has been taken further by scholars who have sought to demonstrate the role of language and culture not only in conveying mystical experiences, but in creating them as well.45 More recently, Elliot Wolfson has emphasized the extent to which mysticism can be seen as a hermeneutical process, and so seeks to narrow the gap separating exegesis and experience.46 In the case of Hekhalot literature, the question of whether its primary meaning can be found in the individual's experience is particularly acute. The authors of Hekhalot literature speak through the figures of early sages, and do not relate their experiences directly. Rather, they tell stories of how those rabbis traveled to heaven and saw what was there. The Hekhalot texts occasionally speak of emotional and physical effects of the vision on the individual. However, there are few indications that the au­thors conceived of the ascent exclusively as an internal process—that they 41 Most influential have been Evelyn Underhill, Mysticism (1911; reprint, New York: Doubleday, 1990); Rudolph Otto, The Idea of the Holy, 2nd ed.

It holds that the numinous, sometimes bizarre scenes depicted in the literature represent the results of mystical visions cultivated by the authors and transcribed pseudepigraphically as the ascents of Rabbis Ishmael, Akiba, and Nehuniah ben ha-Qannah. Accordingly, the prayers, rituals, and statements regarding the esoteric status of the ritual have been seen as means for achieving that vision. However, recent studies challenge or modify this approach.48 From Inner Experience to Ritual Most scholars of Hekhalot literature since Scholem have considered the texts in terms of the experience of the individuals who wrote them.49 For example, prayer in Hekhalot literature has been analyzed primarily in terms of its expression of the mystic's apprehension of the numinous and his goal of achieving a mystical state. Yet those prayers were carefully crafted according to well-defined poetic and liturgical patterns, and may have served other functions.50 Moreover, the individual's experience itself is inaccessible to us. As Ber­nard McGinn observes: \"Those who define mysticism in terms of a certain type of experience of God often seem to forget that there can be no direct access to experience for the historian. Experience as such is not a part of 47 This stands in contrast to Hai Gaon's characterization of Merkavah mysticism, dis­cussed in Chapter 6. Hai sees the Merkavah mystic as \"looking into himself\" and seeing a vision of the heavens. This is consistent with his internalist view of mysticism and magic, by which unexplained phenomena are products of changes in the observer's consciousness, not the external world. On this view, see Moshe Idel, Golem: Jewish Magical and Mystical Tradi­tions on the Artificial Anthropoid (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1990), 47-53. Wolfson, Speculum That Shines, 108-112, argues that conventional views of the vision in Hekhalot literature operate from inappropriate dichotomies. 48 See now Martha Himmelfarb, Ascent to Heaven m Jewish and Christian Apocalypses (New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993), 108-10, on the argument that, as she puts it, \"Hekhalot literature should be understood not as rites to be enacted but as stories to be repeated.\" Cf. also Schafer, \"Aim and Purpose,\" Swartz, Mystical Prayer, and Halperin, Faces of the Chariot. While Halperin argues against seeing Hekhalot literature as a product of ecstatic mysticism, his approach, which stresses the psychological dynamics of the individual authors, still places the emphasis on internal mental processes; cf. below. 49 See in particular Gruenwald, Apocalyptic; Ira Chernus, Mysticism in Rabbinic Judaism (Berlin and New York: de Gruyter, 1982); Joseph Dan, \"The Religious Experience of the Merkavah,\" in Green, Jewish Spirituality, 289-307. 50 See Michael D.

The only thing directly available to the historian or historical theologian is the evidence, largely in the form of written records, left to us by the Christians of former ages.\"51 The dialectical tension be­tween internal experience and external behavior is emblematic of an ongo­ing concern in the phenomenology of religion, manifest in how scholars of religion treat ritual rules as a subject for study. In the first two chapters of Natural Symbols, entitled \"Away from Ritual\" and \". . . to Inner Experi­ence,\" Mary Douglas exposes the origins of the tendency not to take the outer manifestations of ritual behavior sufficiently seriously. This tendency has its roots in conflicts going back to the Reformation concerning the proper nature of religion.52 Douglas warns of the poverty of interpretative depth that can result from overlooking the significance of the details of ritual behavior.53 The study of asceticism provides a case in point. Among modern schol­ars, it has been common until recently to focus on inner motivations for ascetic behavior.54 Yet we customarily identify asceticism in terms of that behavior. If we do not pay careful attention to that behavior, we therefore neglect the decisive characteristic of asceticism. This emphasis on inner experience has also dominated the way ritual has been treated in the study of Hekhalot literature. The elaborate rituals of fasting, ablution, and seclusion in these texts have conventionally been considered to be designed for the specific purpose of achieving the state of ecstasy usually associated with the ascent to the Merkavah.55 There is no denying that fasting, diet, and seclusion are likely to have an effect on the individual's consciousness. But as it is difficult to determine motivations for ascetic behavior without the subject's personal testimony, so too it is difficult to assess the degree to which inner experience is reflected in this anonymous, highly conventional literature.56 Moreover, few of these rit­uals have been analyzed in detail.57 However, if we defer the question of 51 McGinn, The Foundations of Mysticism (New York: Crossroad, 1991),xiv. 52 Likewise, an important consequence of Keith Thomas's Religion and the Decline of Magic (New York: Scribner's, 1971) is to make us aware of the degree to which modern notions of the relationship of magic to religion stem from Reformation debates.

Smith, Drudgery Divine: On the Comparison of Early Chris­tianities and the Religions of Late Antiquity (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1990). 53 Mary Douglas, Natural Symbols: Explorations in Cosmology (New York: Pantheon, 1982). 54 For a critique of this tendency to see ascetic behavior in terms of its motives, see Steven D.

It was common until recently to see in rabbinic Judaism a rejection of magical ideas; that is, the rabbis would not assent to the coercive use of ritual or the name of God.61 Yet although the Talmuds do discuss forbidden magi­cal practices,62 historians of Judaism have observed that the rabbinic lead­ership in late antiquity cultivated practices that could conventionally be considered magical.63 But this rediscovery of the magical dimension of ancient Judaism, like any discussion of the place of magic in a religious phenomenon, poses several problems. Contemporary students of religion have questioned the applicability of the term magic, and a satisfactory definition has not been formulated.64 Much of the controversy surrounding the term magic has focused on how the notion of magic is applied to traditional, non-Western societies. Bound up with this issue is the question of whether there is something intrinsic called \"magic\" that can be separated from \"religion,\" 59 Scholem,Jewish Gnosticism, 65-83. 60 Peter Schafer considers magic to be an essential component of the literature. See his \"Aim and Purpose\" and Hidden and Manifest God; see n. 113 below. 61 See, for example, Urbach, Sages, 97-134; and Blau, Zauberwesen. 62 The principal discussion of forbidden practices is chapter 10 of the tractate Sanhedrin. 63 Important work on magical elements in the rabbinic milieu has been done by Saul Lieberman, Daniel Sperber, and Jacob Neusner, among others. See especially Saul Lieber-man, Hellenism in Jewish Palestine (New York: Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1962); and the studies collected in Daniel Sperber, Magic and Folklore in Rabbinic Litera­ture (Ramat Gan: Bar Ilan University Press, 1994).

The Haside 'Ashkenaz collected and annotated many earlier magical texts such as the Havdalah de-Rabbi Akiba and Sefer ha-Razim; however, this does not necessarily mean that these texts themselves derived from circles of the ancient Jewish elite. 64 See especially Hans H. Penner, \"Rationality, Ritual and Science,\" in Jacob Neusner, Ernest S. Frerichs, and Paul V. M. Flesher, Religion, Science and Magic: In Concert and in Conflict (New York: Oxford, 1989), 11-24.

Indeed, to separate or rank magic in oppo­sition to religion not only misstates their relationship, but limits the sphere of religion, which can encompass the use of ritual power for the individ­ual's needs.66 In this study the term magic will be used within a particular heuristic frame of reference, as the applicability of the notion of magic to each cul­tural context must be decided on a case-by-case basis.67 In the case of Judaism, it is possible to use the term to describe identifiable textual cor­pora having distinct literary traits. In paying close attention to literary features in establishing criteria for classification, we have the opportunity to listen to the voices of the magicians themselves—concentrating on their distinctive rhetoric and logic. Based on recent studies of Jewish magical texts in Late Antiquity and the earlier Middle Ages,68 we can identify three prevailing elements of Jewish magical texts: (1) the emphasis on the power of the name of God; (2) the intermediacy of the angels in negotiating between divine providence and human needs; and (3) the application of divine names and ritual practices for the needs of specific individuals.69 This characterization has the advantage of describing a type of activity that can exist within the framework of religious behavior.70 Each of its components can be found in other areas of ancient Judaism. Yet these elements come together in a fairly coherent way in what are conventionally called magical texts—especially amulets, handbooks containing incanta­tion texts, and ritual prescriptions. We therefore have a way of designating them that, like all heuristic terms, allows us to proceed in an economical manner. 65 On this issue see the debate between Geertz and Thomas cited in note 64.

For example, Ramsay MacMullen listed magicians, along with philosophers, astrologers, and soothsayers, among the \"enemies of the Roman order.\"72 Moreover, those theories of social analysis that see the term magic primarily as an expression of accusation against objects of a community's social disapproval can also be related to the notion that magic is a subversive phenomenon.73 In these more purely social definitions of magic, it is identified not with the characteristics of a particular set of practices, but with its antinormative status.74 According to this approach, it is not merely that magic is by definition subversive, but that subversive religious practices are by definition magic.75 On the other hand, there are those who stress the role of tradition in the 71 Emile Durkheim, The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life (New York: Free Press, 1965), 60. As Durkheim puts it, W. Robertson Smith saw magic as \"opposed to religion as society is to the individual.\" See Durkheim, Elementary Forms, 61 n. 62, summarizing W. Robertson Smith, Lectures on the Religion of the Semites, 3rd ed. (1927; reprint, New York: Ktav, 1969), 264-65 (Durkheim cites the second edition). As Durkheim's note im­plies, we need not posit a dichotomy between magic and religion to see magic as subversive both of a religious society's social order and its traditional values. 72 Ramsay MacMullen, Enemies of the Roman Order: Treason, Unrest, and Alienation in the Empire (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1966), 95-127.

E. Evans-Pritchard, Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic among the Azande (Oxford: Clarendon, 1937), led the way to this approach by focusing not on the practice of witchcraft but on how accusations of witchcraft functioned in the society. The im­plications of this approach are drawn out in Mary Douglas, ed., Witchcraft Confessions and Accusations (London: Tavistock, 1970); for its application to the Greco-Roman environment see, in that volume, Peter Brown, \"Sorcery, Demons and the Rise of Christianity from Late Antiquity into the Middle Ages,\" 17-45. 74 For an early formulation of such a social definition see Marcel Mauss, A General Theory of Magic, trans. Robert Brain (London and Boston: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1972), 24. For the application of this idea to Greco-Roman religions see in particular Jonathan Z. Smith, \"Good News Is No News: Aretalogy and Gospel,\" in Christianity, fudaism and Other Greco-Roman Cults: Studies for Morton Smith at Sixty, ed. Jacob Neusner (Leiden: Brill, 1975), 21-38; cf. Aune, \"Magic in Early Christianity,\" who identifies magic with deviant re­ligious practices. For a summary and discussion of this argument see Versnel, \"Reflections.\" 75 This theory thus cannot by definition center on a body of evidence for practices alleged to be magical themselves. Nor, as Versnel observes (\"Reflections,\" 183), does such analysis \"preclude the existence of more concrete 'substantive' implications of the term.\""},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"22 CHAPTER 1 validation of magical practices.76 This argument modulates the characteri­zation of magic as individualistic or antisocial. The appeal to tradition would indicate a magician conscious of social norms and shared myths. In light of this debate, the magical dimension of Hekhalot literature can be critical evidence of its social origins and function. It will be seen that Jew­ish magical literature has much to tell us about the literary form, operating principles, and social setting of the Hekhalot texts. Scholasticism In this study the Sar-Torah phenomenon is described as scholastic magic because of its appropriation of rabbinic scholasticism through magical means. The term scholasticism commonly refers to the curriculum, philos­ophy, and ethos of medieval European Christian academies. However, the term has occasionally been applied to Greco-Roman philosophy, talmudic Judaism, and trends in Eastern religions. Scholasticism is a category that is only now gaining recognition in the comparative study of religion. In our quest to understand premodern religious phenomena in their variety, historians of religion often focus on those activities, such as magic, that seem most alien to modern sensibilities, while paying less attention to the phenomenological aspects of types of scholastic behavior that seem closest to our own, intellectualist approach. Yet scholasticism and magic have something in common. The term scholasticism, like magic, has often been used pejoratively. It is sometimes used to refer to the activity of intel­lectual bureaucrats engaged in irrelevant logic-chopping and endless com­mentary.77 Both categories have served as important arguments in the Reformation—both against Catholicism and Judaism—and have there­fore been important in forming our modern understanding of religion.78 Moreover, scholasticism also shares with magic a past reputation as a kind 76 See, for example, Bronislaw Malinowski, Magic, Science and Religion (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday Anchor, 1954), 74-75, on which see Chapter 7 below. Cf. Max Weber, The Sociology of Religion (Boston: Beacon, 1964), 20-31 and elsewhere, who relates magic closely to priestcraft and thus to old aristocratic elements in religious society. 77 See, most recently, George Steiner, Real Presences (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1989), 39-47, who sees in the scholastic heritage of the contemporary university many of its current failings. Indeed, even some of the more dispassionate writers on scholasti­cism have attributed these characteristics to later scholasticism. See for example Joseph Pieper, Scholasticism: Personalities and Problems of Medieval Philosophy (London: Faber and Faber, 1960), 24-25; cf. also Jacques Le Goff, Intellectuals in the Middle Ages, trans. T. L. Fagan (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1993), and compare his recent reconsideration of his earlier position on pp. xxi-xxii. 78 Recently Jonathan Z. Smith has pointed out how important images of Catholicism have been in forging modern concepts of religion; see his Drudgery Divine. See also J.

In a forthcoming study of language in Tibetan Buddhism, Jose Cabezon argues for the \"decon-textualization\" of the category of scholasticism and its use in religious studies.81 According to Cabezon, scholasticism can describe social and intellectual movements in several complex religious cultures and is often characterized by several features. Among these are a belief in the basic intelligibility of the universe; an orientation to tradition; an investment in the value of intellectual argument for the self-conception of the group; and an interest in synthesizing large quantities of textual material into a coher­ent whole. Although scholasticism is usually associated with philosophical systems, Cabezon acknowledges that the scholastic interest in reconciling the intellectual and experiential dimensions of religious life can be applied to the study of ritual and law, as in Mimamsa Hinduism, Judaism, and Confucianism. This characterization of scholasticism is helpful for placing rabbinic Ju­daism into conceptual context.82 By this account, scholasticism, like rab­binic Judaism, does not rely on reason independent of authority but insists on dialectical practices that are passed down through a succession of teachers. Furthermore, a major feature of talmudic argument involves the comparison and reconciliation of disparate textual sources. In fact, earlier cross-cultural uses of the term scholasticism have occa­sionally referred to Judaism. In an early essay arguing for a comparative concept of scholasticism, P. Masson-Oursel included medieval Jewish phi­losophy among his examples.83 More recently, Anthony Saldarini implies 79 Cf., for example, I. C. Jarvie and Joseph Agassi, \"The Problem of the Rationality of Magic,\" in Rationality, ed. Bryan Wilson (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1970), 172-93, and G. E. R. Lloyd, Demystifying Mentalities (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990), especially pp. 39-72. Cf. the discussions of magic cited in n. 65 above. 80 In fact, this particular connection may go back to ancient Greece. Jacqueline de Rom-milly has shown that Greek intellectuals linked magic and rhetoric for similar reasons.

Sal-darini's book, like earlier related studies by Henry Fischel, places the rabbinic ideals of study and tradition in their Greco-Roman context.84 According to Raimundo Pannikkar, a primary feature of scholasticism is the principle of authority.85 As a consequence, scholastics believe in the intrinsic value of tradition: \"Truth or any other value is not reached by means of private and individualized tools, but by receiving from and hand­ing over . . . the cultural deposit.\"86 The authority of past revelation is presupposed by scholastics' reliance on a canon as the source of scholastic discussion. The contribution of the individual is made in scholasticism through commentary and dialectic.87 In the rabbinic theory of revelation, human agency and wisdom play an essential role. Unlike their apocalyptic predecessors, the rabbis included themselves, their opinions, and their rea­soning in the category of Torah. This is exemplified by the opening to the tractate Avot (known as Sayings of the Fathers), composed shortly after the Mishnah in the third century c.E. and included in the mishnaic canon. As discussed in detail in Chapter 7, this passage depicts the transmission of Torah through a \"chain of tradition,\" in the course of which each genera­tion adds its teachings to that of its forebears. This motif and its cultural background figure prominently in the present study, in which notions of tradition in magical and rabbinic literatures are compared.88 At the same time, a hallmark of scholasticism is seen to be the scholar's faith in rationality as a means of understanding the world. Although whether talmudic thought embodies a different rationality from the West­ern variety, it is acknowledged that patterns of reasoning are essential to talmudic dialectic.89 Talmudic thought shares with other types of scholas­tic activity the interplay of pure reason, faith, and authority. Scholasticism, 105, notes that Maimonides' Guidefor the Perplexed has been called \"a Jewish-Scholastic Summa.\" 84 See Henry A. Fischel, \"The Uses of Sorites (Climax, Gradatio) in the Tannaitic Pe­riod,\" HUCA 44 (1973): 119-51, discussed at length in Chapter 7. Steiner, Real Presences, 40-42, also includes talmudic dialectic and commentary in his description of the scholasti­cism that he opposes. 85 Raimundo Panikkar, \"Common Patterns of Eastern and Western Scholasticism,\" Diu-genes 83 (1973).

Frank Reynolds and David Tracy (Albany: State University"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"MENTALITIES OF ANCIENT JUDAISM 25 The use of scholasticism as a comparative category also implies an inter­est in the living context of learning. The history of rabbinic Judaism is concerned not only with the theological and legal concepts developed with the rabbis, but how they sought to transmit them. Indeed, because of the primacy of the idea of Torah as embodied in the sage and his teaching, rabbinic theology cannot be separated from the behavioral context in which it is carried out. Consideration of the Sar-Torah material alerts us to this point. The Sar-Torah texts claim to enable their readers to achieve the skills and status of wise and powerful rabbis. In order to understand what this meant to them, we must know what activities were promoted in rab­binic societies, what values were held by their elite, and how knowledge and power were conceived by that elite and other classes. It will be seen that the Sar-Torah phenomenon illuminates rabbinic scholasticism by con­trast and provides a rare example of how groups outside the academy saw the rabbinic estate. It is a reminder that scholastic communities affect not only their own class and history, but those of others. THE SAR-TORAH LITERATURE In light of these issues, this study will focus on two important aspects of Hekhalot literature that can serve as indicators of its authors' relationship to society: ritual and tradition. Ritual has played an important role in how Merkavah mysticism has been perceived. It also signifies the authors' rela­tionship to halakhah, magic, and other important cultural systems of the times. So too, by examining the literature's use of ideal figures and its concepts of tradition and authority, we can tell much about how the au­thors saw themselves and their place in society—or at least how they wished society would view them. Both of these elements are prominent in the Sar-Torah texts and can help us understand the historical background of one stream within the Hekhalot tradition. The Sar-Torah tradition is made up of a complex network of stories and ritual prescriptions. The main texts of this tradition are narratives in which a rabbi, usually Rabbi Ishmael, is instructed in the Sar-Torah procedure. The narrative then testifies to the success in learning the rabbi attained when he used that magical procedure. One narrative, found in Hekhalot Rabbati, is cast as a kind of apocalypse, in which the elders of Israel receive of New York Press, 1990), 247-85; cf. Naomi Janowitz and Andrew J. Lazarus, \"Rabbinic Methods of Inference and the Rationality Debate,\" Journal of Religion 72 (1992): 491-511. On the more specific question of whether talmudic logic was influenced by Aristotelian logic, see, for example, Louis Jacobs, Studies in Talmudic Logic and Methodology (London: Cam­bridge University Press, 1961); David Daube, \"Rabbinic Methods of Interpretation,\" HUCA 22 (1949): 239-65; and idem, \"Alexandrian Methods of Interpretation and the Rabbis,\" in Festschrift Hans Lewald (Basel: Helbing and Lichtenhahn, 1953), 27-44."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"26 CHAPTER 1 the secret of the magical procedure. Other Sar-Torah and related texts are brief testimonies and ritual instructions. As we have seen, the Sar-Torah literature is of particular interest for its emphasis on the study of Torah as an object of magical activity. As Torah constitutes revelation for classical Judaism, and is mediated, according to rabbinic thought, in an unbroken chain from God through Moses to the rabbis of the latest generation, a phenomenon whose avowed purpose was to increase one's proficiency in learning Torah has both conceptual and social ramifications. Torah was both a central value and an indicator of status in rabbinic society. The study of Torah was both a ritual act and the sign of a great man. The authors of the Sar-Torah corpus sought to achieve this greatness through magical means. As we will see, they were influenced by rabbinic legends and speculation about the original revelation of Torah. However, they were also influenced by magical, mystical, and apocalyptic literatures, and we must look to those genres as well to understand their needs and priorities. By doing so we can also delineate the relationship of these authors to the sources of holiness and authority of their society. As a corollary of the principle that the Sar-Torah phenomenon is to be studied on its own terms, attention will be paid to the practical consider­ations behind the central purposes of the texts and their consequences. Because the Sar-Torah texts claim to give the individual great skill in studying Torah, we will consider what that may have meant to the practi­tioners. In rabbinic theology, Torah constitutes both the substance of rev­elation and its content. To apply terms articulated for the study of ancient Judaism by Michael fishbane, the idea of Torah embraces both traditio— the way in which a sacred culture is transmitted—and tmditium—the message of that culture.90 Accordingly, in considering the meaning of Torah for the Sar-Torah literature, we will examine what, in the most pal­pable of terms, the activity of learning Torah entailed. Particularly illu­minating for this purpose is research undertaken recently on the role of memory in premodern scholastic cultures, and in rabbinic Judaism in par­ticular.91 In addition, we will explore the specific significance that Torah and revelation take on when set into the esoteric and magical context of the Sar-Torah texts in the Hekhalot literature.92 90 Michael Fishbane, Biblical Interpretation in Ancient Israel (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1985), 6-19.

Only by understanding its formal properties, rhetoric, poetic cadences, and special vocabulary can we uncover the con­cerns and worldviews of its authors. This task is made at once easier and more complicated thanks to the efforts of Peter Schafer in the last decade and a half. With the publication of Schafer's Synopse zur Hekhalot-Literatur, a new stage in the study of this literature was reached.93 Schafer found that the manuscript evidence for Hekhalot literature did not warrant the creation of a standard \"critical edition\" in which a manuscript approximating the \"best\" text is presented with variants listed at the bottom. Rather, the nature of the literature required a synoptic arrangement, in which manu­scripts are placed side by side in columns, and no single manuscript is given priority.94 In synoptic presentation, it can be seen that variations between manuscripts of Hekhalot literature often consist of whole paragraphs or sections present in one manuscript and absent, or in an entirely different order, in another. This problem was brought further into relief with the publication of Schafer's Geniza-Fragmente zur Hekhalot-Literatur. Most of the Genizah fragments published there arrange Hekhalot material in entirely unanticipated ways.95 This textual situation, Schafer has argued, attests to a literature that took the form not of cohesive \"books,\" each originating in a single Urtext, but a literature characterized by dynamic, shifting relationships among larger and smaller units.96 Schafer's edition was thus not a provisional one in anticipation of the final reconstruction of the original Hekhalot Rabbati, Hekhalot Zutartii and so on; nor was he expressing pessimism about the possibility of creating such a reconstruction 97 Rather, these findings lead us to see Hekhalot literature, and perhaps many other such texts of rab­binic Judaism, in a new way. 93 Schafer, Synopse. 94 While this is rightly the principle behind Schafer's edition, it should be understood that some manuscripts are clearly inferior copies of better extant manuscripts or their Vorlage. See Michael D. Swartz, review of Martin S. Cohen, The Shi'ur Qomah: Texts and Recensions, JAOS 110(1990): 582-84. 95 On the implications of the Genizah texts for the composition of Hekhalot Rabbati, see Peter Schafer, \"Tradition and Redaction in Hekhalot Literature,\" in Hekhalot-Studien, 11-12. 96 Schafer, \"Tradition and Redaction.\" This textual state is often called \"fluid.\" This term is somewhat misleading as it does not take into account the cohesive smaller units—building blocks or modules, so to speak—that make up the varying forms of a text. 97 Cf. Ithamar Gruenwald, \"Literary and Redactional Issues in the Study of the Hekhalot Literature,\" in From Apocalyptism to Gnosticism, 175-89."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"28 CHAPTER 1 If, as has been argued, the textual problems in Hekhalot literature are relevant to the study of rabbinic texts in general,98 Schafer's thesis raises issues that go beyond the edition and analysis of individual texts or corpora to hermeneutical questions: When and how do we define a text? How can we resolve such matters as authorial intent or redactional program in a corpus that does not easily lend itself to analysis of whole texts that begin and end?\" A possible effect on the reader of encountering this literature, which has no definite boundaries, no center, and in which the identity of individual works is open to question, is described vividly by Halperin: \"Open Schafer's Synopse at any point . . . and you find yourself plunged into a swirl of hymns, incantations, divine names, and fantastic descrip­tions of heavenly beings. All of this usually seems to be assembled in no discernible pattern and to no discernible purpose.\"100 How, then, can we study such a literature? Historically, of course, the Hekhalot corpus did not originate as a swirl of hymns, incantations, and so on. It is the product of many successive generations of scribal activity, oral performance, and redactional control exercised in varying degrees at each stage of the texts' composition. This process spanned from amoraic Pal­estine to medieval Germany.101 When the tools of form- and source-criticism are applied, the literature emerges neither as a collection of discrete and coherent works, nor an amorphous mass of undifferentiated text, but a complex network of inter­related units. These units do in fact fall into patterns and coalesce into a type of textual complex that Schafer terms the macroform.102 In many cases, a coherent history of the textual tradition can be written.103 How-98 Peter Schafer, \"Research into Rabbinic Literature: An Attempt to Define the Status Quaestionis,\"JJS 37 (1986): 139-52; Michael D.

Because of this, the component units take priority in analysis.104 A primary task of the critic is to understand the process of composition, the meaning and character of the constituent units, and the textual and conceptual considerations that led a redactor to arrange them in a given way. This is possible through what might be called a modular approach, which stresses the role of more stable units and their combination in larger collections in analysis. In the case of a study of a phenomenon such as the Sar-Torah literature, that spans several textual traditions, this procedure is of particular value. Through this method it will be seen that the Sar-Torah tradition is one of several building blocks that make up the Hekhalot corpus. Its distinctive nature and purposes can then emerge. Using form and redaction criticism it will be possible to see how the Sar-Torah texts are related to the Hekha-Iot material into which they are set, how the various examples of the Sar-Torah phenomenon are related, and how individual units came to be. Moreover, because of its emphasis on the formal and rhetorical properties of these texts and their implications, form criticism will play a pivotal role in determining the concerns, priorities, and influences of the authors. This discussion of the literary nature of the Hekhalot corpus, which underscores its composite nature, brings us back to the question of the role of individual experience in the study of mystical texts. It suggests that this literature represents not the mystical visions of individuals who tran­scribed them pseudepigraphically as the ascent of Rabbi Ishmael or Rabbi Akiba, but a literary tradition that took shape over several centuries and communities and for several purposes. If this is so, we must proceed with caution when asking what experience lay behind these curious texts. We must also place new emphasis on the contextual and social aspects of Hekhalot literature. As shown above, the Sar-Torah texts lend themselves particularly well to such an approach. Their application of the conventions of ritual and magical procedure to the scholastic values of Torah and wis­dom illustrate the conjunction between the literary, pragmatic, and social factors that operate in this literature. By this method it will be shown that the Sar-Torah and ascent traditions in Hekhalot literature are distinct redactional and historical phenomena. At the same time, we will observe phenomenological and historical affini­ties between the Sar-Torah and ascent literatures that make the Sar-Torah texts relevant to the central issues in the study of Merkavah mysticism. These affinities may have led the redactors of the Hekhalot literature to include them in the Hekhalot corpus.105 Moreover, both sectors of the 104 See Schafer, \"Tradition and Redaction,\" 15-16. 105 For ritual assumptions that inform both, see chapter 7.

While the focus of this study is on the Sar-Torah corpus, related texts, such as those concerning conjuration of the Angel of the Presence, will also be analyzed in detail. Because the authors of Sar-Torah undoubtedly lived under the deep influence of rabbinic Judaism, the rabbinic canon is an important source for determining linguistic, legal, and exegetical details, as well as for un­derstanding the Sar-Torah practitioners' relationship to their social envi­ronment. The Hekhalot texts stand outside of what might be strictly termed the rabbinic canon, having been transmitted only in small circles through the Middle Ages.107 But this literature, along with other texts of what can be called rabbinic apocrypha,108 has expanded the boundaries of the texts we use to understand rabbinic Judaism. This category includes extracanonical halakhic and quasi-legal tractates of Geonic provenance109 and so-called minor midrashim. Many of the latter are published in an­thologies such as Jellinek's Bet ha-Midrash and Wertheimer's Bate Mid-rashot110—which made the Hekhalot literature available to scholars in the first place—and medieval collections embracing folklore and fragments of lost rabbinic texts. These literatures deserve renewed attention from scholars.111 Many of them manifest subtle differences from the rabbinic canon in legal or narra­tive details, religious concerns, and social setting. They thus attest to the diversity within rabbinic Judaism of late antiquity and the early Middle Ages. 106 For the case of Ma'aseh Merkavah, see Swartz, Mystical Prayer, 216-23. 107 The term canon is applied to rabbinic literature here with admitted imprecision; it refers principally to the Mishnah, Tosefta, Babylonian and Palestinian Talmuds, the better-known early midrashim, and so on. On rabbinic ideas of canon see David Kraemer, \"The Formation of Rabbinic Canon: Authority and Boundaries,\" JBL 110 (1991): 613-30. 108 For the term rabbinic apocrypha see Swartz, review of Sperber. 109 See M. B. Lerner, \"The External Tractates,\" in The Literature of the Sages, Part 1, ed. Shmuel Safrai (Philadelphia: Fortress Press), 367-409. 110 See n. 16. 111 The work of Martha Himmelfarb in particular has helped to bring many of these texts to the attention of contemporary scholars. See her Tours of Hell: An Apocalyptic Form in Jewish and Christian Literature (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1985); for medieval Hebrew texts see Joseph Dan, Ha-Sippur ha-'Ivri be-Yeme ha-Senayim: cIyyunim be-Toldotav (Jerusa­lem: Keter, 1974)."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"MENTALITIES OF ANCIENT JUDAISM 31 We will also be aided by cosmological and related esoteric texts and magical amulets and handbooks found in the Cairo Genizah and other collections.112 Although the prevalence of magic in Hekhalot literature has been recognized,113 Jewish magical literature has not been employed systematically for understanding the phenomenology and dynamics of rit­uals in the Hekhalot texts.114 Itwill be seen that affinities between the two corpora go beyond specific details of magical names and techniques to substantial matters of their worldviews and notions of ritual efficacy. PROCEDURE We have seen that we can advance our understanding of the complexity of Jewish society in the rabbinic period by determining the historical and social context of Hekhalot literature. By studying the ritual texts and atti­tudes toward tradition and authority in the literature, we can locate its authors more precisely in comparison to those of the canonical rabbinic texts. At the same time we can illuminate one of the larger issues raised by Hekhalot literature, that of the relationship of mysticism to society and its norms. These two elements, ritual and concepts of tradition, are most prominent in the Sar-Torah literature. This literature itself is an important source for understanding the diversity of forms that the concept and prac­tice of Torah took in rabbinic Judaism and its environs. As the goal of the Sar-Torah practitioner is the acquisition of Torah, we must understand the practices and cultural processes by which ancient and medieval Jews customarily made such acquisition possible. This is done in Chapter 2, in which the place of memory in antiquity in general and rab­binic culture in particular, and ways of cultivating it, are described. We then turn to the texts themselves. In order to understand the Sar-Torah phenomenon it is necessary to analyze the texts in detail (Chapters 3-5), translating and annotating them and paying attention to the peculiar text-critical and literary problems Hekhalot literature presents. Once we have seen the Sar-Torah literature as a whole, we focus on two elements in the literature that make it of particular interest: preparatory rituals and ideas of tradition and authority. When these are examined, it will be seen that the 112 Seen. 58. 113 See Schafer, \"Aim and Purpose;\" Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism, 75-100; and Morton Smith, \"Observations on Hekhalot Rabbati,\" in Biblical and Other Studies, ed.

It is argued in Chapter 6 that the Sar-Torah rituals are best understood not as efforts to achieve a mystical vision, or as evidence for the normative status of mystical halakhah, but as an effort to maintain an supererogatory level of ritual purity for magical purposes. It is shown in Chapter 7 that the authors of this literature and related texts display a highly ambivalent attitude to tradition and authority, one consistent neither with the architects of the normative ideology of religion nor of a lower class protesting that ideol­ogy.

Before we proceed to an analysis of the Sar-Torah texts themselves, it is helpful to examine the relationship between these two aspects of ancient Judaism. In this chapter the place and function of memory in rabbinic Judaism are described briefly in the light of current research on the place of memory in premodern societies. Then the use of magical techniques for improvement of memory is surveyed. Having es­tablished these elements of the Sar-Torah tradition's conceptual frame­work, it will be possible to look at those texts in detail. THE IMPORTANCE OF MEMORY One of the Sar-Torah's most precious gifts to the practitioner is a spectacu­lar memory. In one Sar-Torah text, the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah Ver­sion A, Rabbi Ishmael relates his distress because of his trouble in learning: \"A scriptural passage that I was reading one day1 I would forget the next, and a mishnaic passage that I was repeating one day I would forget the next\" (§278). When he performs the Sar-Torah ritual correctly, \"imme­diately my heart was enlightened like the gates of the east, and my eyes gazed into the depths and paths of Torah, and never again did I forget anything my ears heard from my teacher, of study; nor would I ever again forget anything of the paths of Torah in which I engaged for their truth\" (§279). Rabbi Ishmael's \"enlightenment\" consists not only of spiritual or intellectual insight, or encompassing wisdom;2 rather, he has been blessed by the angel with an exceptional memory. Thanks to the magic of the Sar-Torah, Rabbi Ishmael will now be able to remember not only the Bible and Mishnah of his curriculum, but every statement and analytical discus­sion he hears. In order to understand the importance of this aspect of the 1 MS. M22: le-yamim, \"after [a few] days.\" 2 It must be remembered that the heart was the seat of intellect for ancient Jews. See Fred Rosner, trans, and ed., Julius Preuss's Biblical and Talmudic Medicine (New York: Hebrew Publishing Company, 1983), 104-5; Preuss notes rabbinic expressions (for example, b. Menah. 80b and Yeb. 9a: \"He doesn't have a brain in his skull\") that also ascribe intellectual function to the brain. That idea, however, is not found in our corpus."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"34 CHAPTER 2 Sar-Torah tradition and its implications, it will be helpful to look at the place and nature of memorization in rabbinic civilization. The practice of memory in premodern civilizations has only recently been given concentrated attention, although its role in oral societies has been acknowledged since the inception of folklore studies. Since Frances Yates's pioneering study, The Art of Memory,3 recent work on the subject has shed light on an important current in classical and medieval Western cultures: the scholastic traditions and esoteric techniques for cultivation of memory. With the appearance of Mary Carruthers's Book of Memory, the role of memory not only as an activity but as a value and psychological concept has been brought to prominence in historical studies. Studies have also appeared assessing the implications of memory techniques in non-Western cultures and contemporary traditional societies.4 The following summary of traditions on memory in Judaism in late antiquity is informed by this recent trend in research.5 Its purpose is to demonstrate the impor­tance of memory for rabbinic civilization and to explore the options avail­able to those who, like the Sar-Torah practitioners, wanted to increase this vital capacity. In Rabbinic Judaism The study of memory in rabbinic Judaism is still in its beginnings. While there has been a good deal of debate in recent decades about orality in rabbinic literature,6 the systematic study of its relationship to memoriza-3 Francis A.

The premodern scholastic cultures described by Yates and Carruthers elaborated and systematized many concepts of mind and memory that were current throughout the ancient world and are still held in many cultures. Therefore the comparison and contrast between these systems and rabbinic scholas­ticism is warranted as long as the important differences between these cultures are kept in mind. 6 For bibliographies on orality in early rabbinic Judaism see the important discussion in H. L. Strack and G. Stemberger, Introduction to the Talmud and Midrash (Edinburgh: T & T Clark, 1991), 35-49; E. Schurer, The History of the Jewish People in the Age ofJesus Christ, rev. and ed. by G.

Rabbinic teaching is often referred to as the Oral Torah, Torah she-be'al peh. This designation was not always applied by the early rabbis to their enterprise.9 Still, the term has become a common one, and the claim thought to be represented by that term—that rabbinic literature repre­sents an orally transmitted Torah—has had a deep influence on the histo­riography of Judaism in late antiquity.10 Much of the debate on the oral Press, 1987), 1:35-119. The major study of the subject to this date is Birger Gerhardsson, Memory and Manuscript: Oral Tradition and Written Transmission in Kabbinic Judaism and Early Christianity (Lund: C. WE. K. Gleerup and Copenhagen: Ejnar Munksgaard, 1961); for a critique of this work's historical argument cf. Morton Smith, \"A Comparison of Early Christian and Early Rabbinic Traditions,\" JBL 82 (1963): 169-76; the book does, however, include an important collection and discussion of rabbinic traditions on oral transmission. Cf. Lieberman, Hellenism in Jewish Palestine, 83-99; Jacob Neusner, \"Oral Torah and Oral Tradition: Defining the Problematic,\" in Method and Meaning in Ancient Judaism (Chico, Calif.: Scholars Press, 1979), 59-75. See also the studies cited in the following note. The best and most up-to-date discussion of the issue, however is Martin S. Jaffee, \"How Much Orality in 'Oral Torah?' New Perspectives on the Composition and Transmission of Early Rabbinic Tradition,\" Shofar 10 (1992): 53-72, which takes full account of the contemporary study of orality in traditional societies. 7 See Gerhardsson, Memory and Manuscript, 122-70; Dov Zlotnick, \"Memory and the Integrityof the Oral Tradition, JANES 16-17 (1984-85): 229-41. There is also an account of the role of memory in rabbinic education in Nathan Morris, The Jewish School (London, 1937; reprint, New York: Jewish Education Committee Press, 1964), 112-45. Forthe Mish-nah see Jacob Neusner, The Memorized Torah: The Mnemonic System of the Mishnah (Chico, Calif.: Scholars Press, 1985) and idem, Oral Tradition in Judaism: The Case of the Mishnah (New York and London: Garland, 1987). Neusner's studies are based on internal evidence, namely, the formal traits of mishnaic language. Because of the nature of the evidence and that particular program of research, these studies do not deal comprehensively with attestations in talmudic literature to mnemonic techniques. An early study that recognizes the mnemonic nature of rabbinic formulations is the highly influential work, originally published in 1924, of Marcel Jousse, The Oral Style, trans. Edgard Sienaert and Richard Whitaker (New York and London: Garland, 1990). 8 For models for such a study of learning techniques we may look to David Goodblatt, Talmudic Instruction in Sasanian Babylonia (Leiden: Brill, 1975). On the possibilities for retrieving such data from talmudic literature see David Goodblatt, \"Towards the Rehabilita­tion of Talmudic History,\" in History of Judaism: The Next Ten Years, ed.

Those who have argued that rabbinic literature originated in oral legal traditions and au­thentic statements of the early sages have often used that argument for the purpose of showing that rabbinic traditions had been transmitted faithfully for generations before having been written down.11 This view was chal­lenged by those who argued that mishnaic literature originated in texts formulated for oral recitation.12 In the light of what we now know about the dynamic relationship between writing and recitation in antiquity, the strategies of oral and mnemonic composition that undoubtedly reside in the Mishnah and related texts do not seem quite so anomalous. As important as this debate is for rabbinic history, it is now becoming clear that it bears on other issues besides that of how ancient or useful information in rabbinic texts is for historical reconstruction. Indeed, the latter question is quite independent of some of the issues raised by the study of orality in ancient Judaism. For example, it is possible that the degree of literacy in a society has a deep influence on its modes of thought.13 At the same time, recent studies show that in predominantly oral societies in which literacy has increased, the introduction of written texts in fact serves the culture of memorization. Although a literate culture has the capacity to store information in written texts, those texts often do not displace the adept memorizer; intellectuality is still conceived in terms of the scholar's command of memorized text.14 Those written texts that do not function substance of rabbinic law was transmitted from Sinai to the rabbis was an important argu­ment against the Karaites, the term Torah she-be-'al peh referred to the rabbinic process of learning and explication of written rabbinic texts. See also below. 11 See, for example, Gerhardsson, Memory and Manuscript, and Safrai, \"Oral Torah.\" 12 See Smith, \"Comparison.\" Building on Lieberman's thesis in Hellenism in Jewish Pal­estine, Jacob Neusner, \"Oral Torah,\" argued that the rabbinic process of oral composition was specifically formulated to emulate the dual revelation of Torah at Sinai. Recently, this thesis has been modified; see Strack and Stemberger, Introduction, 47-48, and Jaffee, \"Orality.\" 13 On this idea see Jack Goody, The Domestication of the Savage Mind (Cambridge: Cam­bridge University Press, 1977), Walter J.

Rather, it is important to this discussion that there was such an ethic, and that it had practical consequences for religion and social status. MEMORIZATION AND THE CURRICULUM In traditional rabbinic education, the basic texts were to be memorized before they were understood and discussed. B. Abod. Zar. 19b contains this advice: \"One should always learn Torah and afterwards contemplate [yehegeh] it; as it is stated, 'the Torah of the Lord [is his delight]'—and continues: 'and he contemplates [yehegeh] his Torah' (Ps. 1:2). Rava said: A man should always acquire knowledge,18 even if he forgets, and even if he does not know what he is saying.\" These statements presuppose two stages of learning: the first, in which the text is acquired or memorized, and the second, in which the act of analytic review of the passage (denoted by the verb hjjh) takes place. The statement attributed to Rava stresses that the student should memorize even if he does not understand what he is reciting.19 This principle held true for Greco-Roman antiquity in general, and in­deed for many traditional educational systems.20 In fact, there are indica­tions that in some societies it was considered detrimental for students 224-39, gives examples of communities that are traditionally nonliterate and that look down upon literate Western society for carrying its tradition in books rather than in memory. 15 See Graham, Beyond the Written Word, 177-78.

For other traditional systems, see the following notes."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"38 CHAPTER 2 to understand something they had learned in the early stages of education. S. D. Goitein, in the course of describing the educational system of Ge-nizah society, recounts how teachers in the traditional Morrocan Jewish schools he had observed were particularly proud of their students' having memorized large bodies of material—such as the complex talmudic pas­sages in Aramaic—that they did not understand; indeed, the teachers were perplexed when Goitein was less than approving of the system.21 In a similar way, young Brahmins are taught ancient Vedic ritual texts syllable by syllable, although they do not understand a word of the Sanskrit they are memorizing.22 Societies that make this distinction acknowledge in a way that memoriz­ation and knowledge are not exactly the same thing. For real knowledge of a text—even for basic retention of its words—it is not sufficient to be able to recite it. It should be known literally backwards and forwards. As Car-ruthers explains, intellectuals looked down upon those who could simply recite texts by rote.23 The Greco-Roman and medieval mnemonic systems were designed to place the words and topics of a text in a mental picture in such a way that it could be recalled in any order—taken out, as it were, like objects on a shelf. There is evidence that for rabbinic Jews as well, standards and criteria for memorized knowledge varied according to the authority and circum­stances. It was accepted that knowledge had to be accompanied by under­standing. The comparison and analysis of sources was usually the last stage in a rabbi's education. This enterprise, however, required the kind of recall that could only be cultivated by intensive memory training. Several statements and terms, such as the statement of Rava quoted above, enumerate the levels of understanding required for rabbinic learn­ing. In m. Avot 5:21 a list of the stages of education and religious respon­sibility is attributed to Judah b. Tema: \"Five years old for scriptures, ten years old for Mishnah, thirteen for mitzvot, fifteen for study \\ talmud\\.\" In Avot 2:8, Yohanan ben Zakkai enumerates the scholastic virtues of his five students. Rabbi Eliezer is a \"cistern that does not lose a drop,\" that is, he retains what he has learned; but R. Eleazar ben Arakh is an \"overflowing spring\"—this probably refers to his capacity for adding to what he has 21 Goiten, Mediterranean Society 2:109. According to Goitein, the teacher replied, \"Does not your honor know that trying to reason and to interpret a text before knowing it by heart is damaging to the brain?\" This response bears on the physiology of memory described below. 22 Staal, \"Fidelity.\" For a vivid illustration of the kinetic memorization technique em­ployed in the Agni ceremony see the film Altar of Fire, directed by Robert Gardner (Berke­ley: University of California Extension Media Center, 1977). 23 Carruthers, Book of Memory, 20.

Sot. 22a that, like the magician, the professional memorizer (tanna) recites and does not know what he is saying."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"MEMORY, TORAH, AND MAGIC 39 learned by his analysis.24 B. Hor. 14a contains a debate on which type of scholar is preferable: \"Sinai,\" the sort of scholar whose encyclopedic knowledge encompasses sinaitic revelation, or iOqer harim—one who \"up­roots mountains\" with his penetrating analysis. According to this passage, the Palestinian sages decided in favor of Sinai25 As H. L. Strack and G. Stemberger point out, rabbinic admonitions demonstrate that students were often in danger of forgetting their learn­ing.26 Likewise, the Sar-Torah texts sometimes complain of the tedious labor (yegi'ah) involved in learning Torah. Israel registers this complaint before God in the Sar-Torah text in Hekhalot Rabbati (§282); the Sar-Torah practitioner is assured that he will be able to learn Torah \"without toil\" (§§281,289). Although there were talmudic sages for whom no such complaints are recorded, we should not be too quick to dismiss our au­thors' concerns as those merely of poor students without substance or intellectual curiosity. To be sure, modern educational values and spans of attention differ greatly from that of the traditional societies that stressed rote memorization. But there is evidence that the process was not always taken in stride by premodern students. In his study of traditional Islamic education in the 1920s and 1930s, Dale Eickelman shows how the monotony of learning Quran and Hadith led many students to drop out of Moroccan Islamic schools of higher learning.27 This educational system had yet to give way to one in which the importance of memorization would be supplanted by print or mass-media culture. Rather, like the societies under study here, it was \"in some ways intermediate between oral and written systems of transmission of knowledge.\"28 The burden of memorizing texts by rote without explana­tion evidently took its toll on many students, including those who did have the wherewithal to continue their education if they had wanted to do so. According to an Irish source cited by Philippe Borgeaud,29 the highest-ranking scholar could recite 250 long stories and 100 short ones. When this is compared to the amount of memorization required for, say, an order of Mishnah and its external traditions, added to the volume of scriptures at 24 See Albeck's note to this passage in C.

MNEMONIC DEVICES In its emphasis on memorization and oral recitation of sources, whether written or oral, rabbinic society was therefore consonant with its Greco-Roman cultural surroundings. Some Roman orators, however, developed elaborate mnemonic systems to aid them in their tasks. These systems con­tinued into the Middle Ages and flourished in the Renaissance.31 What mnemonic aids were available to the Jewish sages and their students, who relied so thoroughly on memorization of legal traditions? EAucational Strategies Research has so far uncovered no equivalent in ancient Jewish civilization to the elaborate architectural systems developed by the ancient rhetors and their descendants. Judging from rabbinic evidence, Torah was learned pri­marily by rote and repetition. One reason may have been the nature of the performance of the text to be memorized. The Latin and scholastic mem­ory traditions were designed for memoria ad res, \"memory for things,\" which was most applicable in rhetoric, in which some improvisation was possible around a set of standard themes. Rabbinic learning, however, in­volved the reproduction of the exact words of a statement—memoria ad verba—and so necessitated rote memorization.32 Nevertheless, there were ways in which this task could be made easier. Carruthers observes that failure in memory was thought to be a result of the individual's inadequate effort to impress the proper information on the mind rather than failure to recollect what was there all the time.33 So too rabbinic statements on memory stress preparation over recollection. A tra­dition that had been learned properly in the first place—under the right circumstances, and formulated in the most convenient way—would stand a greater chance of remaining in the memory. It has been noted that the highly formulaic nature of Mishnaic and cognate traditions facilitated their memorization.34 The rabbis also offered advice for effective teaching and learning. For example, the discussion of the educational process in 30 See Goitein, Mediterranean Society, 2:175; Morris, The Jewish School, 84-96. 31 Hajdu, Mnemotechnische Striften, Yates, Art of Memory, and Carruthers, Book of Memory. 32 My thanks to Professor Harald Weinrich for suggesting to me these implications of the distinction. 33 On conceptions of the neuropsychology of memory in antiquity and the Middle Ages see Carruthers, Book of Memory, 46-79. 34 Neusner, Memorized Torah."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"MEMORY, TORAH, AND MAGIC 41 b. Abod. Zar. 19a-b quoted above also includes the question of whether it is preferable to memorize in large portions or small doses.35 Texts were also seen having a mnemonic function.36 Besides the \"pri­vate scroll\" (megillat seta-rim), which was used by an individual scholar to remind him of certain texts, there were written texts of aggadah, which were recommended in a statement in the Palestinian Talmud for their usefulness in aiding memorization.37 Professional memorizers were also employed as references. The function of such a professional, called tanna or roveh, was to act as a repository of the authoritative text of the mishnaic and extramishnaic traditions.38 Like the students in Goitein's account (and, according to one talmudic saying, like the magician), the tanna did not necessarily understand what he recited.39 However, the presence of the reciter did not free the teacher from the obligation to retain what he knew of the tradition in memory. Another important aid to memory was music.40 There is evidence that mishnaic and talmudic texts were chanted with some kind of melody.41 These aids to memory lie more in the realm of educational method than specific memory techniques. There were also specific mnemonic devices available to the student, many of whom were worked into the text and structure of rabbinic literature. Chief among these were simanim, \"signs\" consisting of acronyms or phrases that stood for lists of details to be re­membered 42 These, however, do not seem to have been systematically applied. NEUROPHYSIOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY Memory, like other mental faculties, was thought in antiquity and the Middle Ages to have a physiological basis. While the theories underlying this conception ranged from Aristotelian psychology to practical medicine, 35 Cf. Carruthers, Book of Memory, 50, on the idea that the memory should be \"fed\" in small doses. 36 This despite occasional statements opposing the writing down of halakhah and ag-gadah. On this issue see Strack and Stemberger, Introduction, 37-42. 37 Y. Ber. 5:1 (9a). On the mnemonic function of books, corresponding to the Greek υπομνήματα, see Lieberman, Hellenism, 87-88, and Gerhardsson, 160-63. 38 See Solomon Gandz, \"The Robeh [roveh] or the Official Memorizer of the Palestinian Schools,\" PAAJR 7 (1935-36): 5-12. 39 B.

For its place in Muslim education, in which the arts of cantillation of the Quran play an important part, see Graham, Beyond the Written Word, 100-104. When analyzing ancient written sources, we should be mindful of the extent to which they were meant to be sung. 41 See b. Meg. 32a; cf. b. Bes. 24a and b. Sab. 106b. 42 Cf. b. Erub. 104a. On these see Jacob Briill, Doresh Ie-Siyyon (Vienna, 1864); and Louis I. Rabinowitz, \"Mnemonics or Memoria Technica,\" £/10:187-90."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"42 CHAPTER 2 it was understood that memory was directly related to the makeup and composition of the body and physical mind.43 A result of this conception was that medical recommendations and pre­scriptions appeared for the improvement of memory. These appeared in the context of instructions for the general health of the person. Although no historical relationship to our texts is suggested here, it is interesting to note affinities with ritual prohibitions found in magical and Sar-Torah rit­ual texts in Carruthers's summary of medieval medical advice for aiding the memory: \"Drunkenness is especially bad, but so are all sorts of im­moderate or superfluous activities, including sexual. . . . A diet which in­cludes fatty meats, strong wine, vinegar, and all sour things, legumes such as beans, and especially garlic, onions, and leeks, is very bad for mem­ory.\"44 Sar-Torah rituals prescribe sexual abstinence and the avoidance of rich or luxurious foods and drink, as well as of foods such as onions and garlic. It will be argued below that these prohibitions reflect peculiar no­tions of ritual purity 45 But we should also keep in mind their relationship to ancient and medieval conventional ideas about the dietary foundations of a good memory. A discussion of memory and retention in the Babylonian Talmud also reflects this conception. B. Hor. 13b contains a collection of traditions on what increases and decreases one's capacity to memorize Torah. Positive prescriptions include eating coal-baked bread and olive oil. Detrimental effects on one's memory could result from such practices as passing be­tween two camels or two women.46 These traditions were extended into the Middle Ages. A medieval mid-rash known as Midmsh Ma 'aseh Tomh, which is a collection of enumera­tion sayings, lists the things that are good for mental capacity: \"Five things fortify wisdom: eating baked bread as much as one requires; a round egg without salt; drinking the residue of pressing; and dipping in salt and eat­ing.\"47 Eggs and baked bread also appear in Sar-Torah recipes for memory or adjuring the Sar-Torah 48 Ignaz Goldziher has shown that similar tradi­tions were current in Islam 49 Specific dietary practices for memory were 43 Carruthers, Book of Memory, 47-71. 44 Ibid., 50. 45 See Chapter 8; Michael D.

One common element was the recommendation of the b&ladur, probably the Semecarpus Anacardium, known as the marking-nut.50 In fact, a popular rhyme advised: Hazor, hazor, ve-'al tizdaqeq le-va.lad.ur: \"repeat, repeat [one's studies] and you will not need to rely on baladur:\"51 The Sar-Torah traditions under study here do not always stress the con­ception that diet has an immediate effect on memory. It is possible that some of its dietary prohibitions reflect a concern that the body's proper constitution be maintained in order to maximize its mental capacity.52 However, their principal significance lies in their relationship to specific Jewish and Mediterranean magical traditions. MEMORY AND MAGIC In late antiquity, magic was called upon to assist the individual in every conceivable aspect of daily life. Jewish and other Mediterranean magical manuals and incantation texts include recipes for healing, prosperity, love, hate, invisibility, virility, popularity—in short, for purposes we might con­sider both pious and impious. Prominent among amulets in the Cairo Ge-nizah are incantations for \"grace and favor,\" that is, social acceptance among friends and family, business associates, or government officials.53 Considering the importance of memory in both the value system and so­cial structure of ancient Jewish society, we should not be surprised to see magical practices designed for the acquisition of memory.54 The corpus of the Greek magical papyri edited by Karl Preisendanz and partially translated by Hans Dieter Betz contains at least four recipes for the improvement of memory.55 These involve some sort of ingestion of a substance or of water in which magical names have been dissolved. Such practices are also extant in Jewish magical manuals, collections of Hekha-Iot literature, and related corpora. They are not particularly prominent in 50 Goldziher, \"Aberglaube,\" 140-42; on this plant see Immanuel Low, Die Flora der Juden (1924-34; reprint Hildesheim: Georg Olms, 1967), 1:202-3. 51 Blumenfeld, ed., 'Osar Nehmftd (Vienna, 1857), 113, quoted in Goldziher, \"Aber­glaube,\" 141-42 and 142 n. 1; cf. also Trachtenberg, Jewish Magic, 191. Perhaps the prop­erty of this nut, which leaves a mark on the skin, is responsible for its reputation for leaving an indelible \"mark\" on the memories of those who use it. 52 Cf. Chapter 8 on the reasons for ritual prohibitions. 53 For the range and distribution of purposes of amulets in the Genizah, see Schiffman and Swartz, Incantation Texts, 46-48. 54 For a survey of medieval practices for the improvement of memory, see Trachtenberg, Jewish Magic, 190-93. 55 PGM 1:232-47, 3:410-23, 3:467-78; 3:424-66 is for \"foreknowledge and memory.\""},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"44   CHAPTER 2 magical manuals; one is just as likely to find incantations for protection of a woman at childbirth as a ritual for intelligence or memory.56 These rituals take several forms. Among the most common in the man-uals are rituals for what is called petihat lev, \"opening the heart.\" The texts often do not mention Torah specifically; rather they are for the purpose of the intellectual faculties—which, we have seen, include both memory and insight. While magical rituals, particularly potions and the like, can be quite arbitrary, the procedures for petihat lev are remarkably uniform. The following examples are taken from fragments of magical handbooks found in the Cairo Genizah. They are representative of the practice of petihat lev in late antiquity and the early Middle Ages. MS. TS K1.28 is a fragment of a handbook that includes a dream in-quiry and a ritual for escaping from prison. On fol. 3a the following in-structions appear: If you want to perform the opening of the heart, purify yourself and take a cup of wine and say the psalm over the cup seven times and drink it. Thus one shall do three times in the morning and drink, and one's heart shall be opened to Torah. And this is reliable and tested. \"My God, My God, why are You [• • •]\" The psalm cited afterward is probably Psalm 63.57 The following text oc-curs in MS. TS K1.117 alongside a malevolent incantation for sending a fire and demons into someone's bowels: 56 See, for example, MS. TS K1.117 below, in which a ritual for memory appears next to a malevolent incantation. 57 The writer has conflated the opening line of Ps. 63, \"piTOK nriK ll?K, with that of Ps. 22, •umty rra^ \"bv. \"hv., which appears in a different context a few lines down.

Blessed are you, Lord, teach me Your statutes.58 The ritual employs the cup of wine used for the havdalah ceremony, which separates the Sabbath from the rest of the week. In fact, there is a widely attested custom of incorporating a ritual for wisdom and memory into the havdalah ceremony. Some manuscripts of the ninth-century Seder Rav Amram Gaon include an incantation to be recited over the wine of hav­dalah: \"I adjure you Potah, Prince of Forgetfulness, that you remove a foolish heart from me and cast it on the mountains and heights, by these holy names: Arimimas, Ansisiel and Patahiel.\"59 At this point the practi­tioner is to recite a list of biblical verses, followed by a pious petition for blamelessness, success, and peace. So too, the geonic Babylonian magical text Havdalah de-Rabbi Akiba opens with a ritual for \"invalidating sorcerers and for one who is harmed by an evil spirit, and one who is banished from [the presence of] his wife, and for opening the heart.\"60 The praxis involves reciting a series of bibli­cal verses and incantations over the cup of wine at havdalah in a synagogue after a ritual ablution. Related rituals for petihat lev are found in a fragmentary magical hand­book from the Cairo Genizah, TS Kl. 132. One instructs the practitioner to write three names in water, dissolve them, and drink the water. Another advises taking the water in which the names have been dissolved and kneading it into cakes. As Peter Schafer points out, this procedure also appears in magical texts for wisdom and memory set into the Hekhalot literature.61 Hekhalot texts, by and large, integrate magical elements into a richer narrative context than that usually found in the magical manuals. In one text (§§571-78), an Aramaic ritual text inserted into Ma'aseh Mer-kavah in one manuscript, the practitioner is to write magical names on a series of substances or objects and consume them, including a cup of wine, fig and olive leaves, and an egg.62 58 Ps. 119:12,26,68. Cf. also §312, in the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah B, where this expression is quoted. 59 Daniel Goldschmidt, ed., Seder Rav 'Amram Gaon (Jerusalem: Mosad ha-Rav Kook, 1971), p. 83. The passage is probably an interpolation. 60 Gershom Scholem, \"Havdalah de-Rabbi cAkivah: Maqor Ie-Masoret ha-Maj/iah ha-Tehudit bi-Tequfat ha-Ge'onim,\" Tarbis 50 (1980-81): 250. 61 Peter Schafer, \"Jewish Magic Literature in Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages,\" JSJ41 (1990): 90. 62 See Chapter 5."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"46 CHAPTER 2 The narrative of the Sar-Torah section of Ma'aseh Merkavah itself con­tains this brief rhetorical dialogue in the course of its instructions for the recitation of powerful (and dangerous) magical names, which effect, as the text puts it, \"the acquisition of wisdom; everyone who pronounces them acquires wisdom forever.\" \"And can anyone endure it? Moses wrote three letters for Joshua and he drank. If you cannot endure it, engrave them as a mark and do not worry yourself with the words of the mighty ones\" (§564).63 Here the original link in the chain of tradition, Moses to Joshua, is the medium for the practice of writing letters and drinking them. Moses has assured Joshua's place in the succession by initiating him into the ritual ingestion of the names, which are \"for fortification of wisdom and for glorification of understanding.\"64 The practice of drinking a fluid, usually wine, over which the names have been recited or in which the names have been dissolved is common to all of these rituals. In fact, at least one of the memory rituals in the corpus of the Greek magical papyri operates in the same way. PGM 1:232-47 contains these instructions for memory: \"Take hieratic papyrus and write the prescribed names with Hermaic myrrh ink. And once you have written them as they are prescribed, wash them off into spring water from seven springs and drink the water on an empty stomach for seven days while the moon is in the east.\"65 The text goes on to list the magical names and the ingredients of the ink. What are we to make of this practice of drinking wine for memory? A passage from 4 Ezra may give us a clue. In that apocalypse, Ezra is given a cup of something to drink, the appearance of which was \"like fire.\" Once he had drunk, says Ezra, My heart poured forth understanding, and wisdom increased in my breast, and my spirit retained its memory, and my mouth was opened, and was no longer closed. (4 Ezra 14:39)66 Like that of Rabbi Ishmael, Ezra's general enlightenment includes an en­hanced memory. Memory accompanies the new information, insight, and wisdom with which he has been blessed. But there may be another dimen­sion to this motif. Michael Stone, in his commentary to 4 Ezra, links the reference to memory to the nature of Ezra's spiritual inspiration.67 Like 63 Heb. gibborim, perhaps referring to the angels who bear the throne. However, it is unclear what their \"words\" might be. 64 See further in Chapter 4. 65 The translation is from Betz, Greek Magical Papyri, 9. 66 The translation is from Michael E. Stone, A Commentary on the Fourth Book of Ezra (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress, 1990), 437. 67 Ibid., 119-20; see also 437-42."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"MEMORY, TORAH, AND MAGIC 47 similar figures, he presumably needed to remember the revelation he had received while in the throes of a prophetic trance. Stone also relates the cup of inspiration to the Hellenistic theme of \"divine drunkenness,\" at­tested in Philo and other sources.68 In fact, the practice of ingesting knowledge by means of drinking a potion or a liquid in which names are written is found in many cultures.69 The function of \"opening the heart\" also lies behind common medieval Jewish ceremonies of initiation into elementary education. As Ephraim Kanarfogel observes, these ceremonies, which occured at the festival of Shavuot (Pentecost), were designed to replicate the revelation at Sinai.70 The ceremony centered on the student's physical encounter with the Hebrew alphabet. Attendant popular customs included that of licking the letters onto which honey or raisins had been placed and eating cakes onto which the letters had been inscribed.71 Honey and cakes are ingredients in some of the memory practices we have seen; thus this custom may have had a purpose beyond conveying the idea that the child's learning should be sweet, to specific conceptions of memory magic. ANGELS OF DIVINATION AND WISDOM The distinctive narrative Sar-Torah texts in the Hekhalot corpus, however, do not correspond to the common ritual pattern of gaining memory by ingestion. The rituals in those texts, in contrast to those for petihat lev, are rituals of abstention and ablution, involving fasts of three to forty days, ritual immersions, and the avoidance of all contact with impurity— 68 De Ebrietas 146-48; see H. Lewy, Sobria Ebrietas (Giessen: Topelman, 1929). 69 Betz, Greek Magical Papyri, cites Handworterbuch des deutsehen Auberglaubens 8:1156-57 on examples of this practice. For an example in Japanese esoteric Buddhism and its inter­pretation see Thomas Blenman Hare, \"Reading Writing and Cooking: Kukai's Interpretive Strategies,\" Journal of Asian Studies 49( 1990): 253-73. 70 Kanarfogel, Jewish Education and Society, 116-17. Cf. also Herman Pollack, Jewish Folkwaysm Germanic Lands (1648-1806) (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1971), 54-55. This cer­emony is depicted in an illumination to the Mahazor Lipsiah; see A.

Halperin, Faces of the Chariot, ascribes central importance to the Pentecost in his account of the origins of Merkavah mysti­cism due to the custom of reciting Ezekiel 1 on Shavuot. However, these specific educational customs do not figure prominently in the Hekhalot literature; see below. For a study of these rituals and their background in rabbinic concepts of memory, see Ivan G. Marcus, Rituals of Childhood: Jewish Acculturation in Medieval Europe (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1996). On the esoteric dimensions of Torah study in Haside Ashkenaz, see Elliot R. Wolfson, \"The Mystical Significance of Torah Study in German Pietism,\" JQR 84 (1993): 43-77. 71 Karanfogel, Education and Society, 117, notes that according to the author of Sefer Assuf at, R. Judah the Pious qualified this detail with the stipulation that the letters should not be inscribed since they would be erased during ingestion."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"48 CHAPTER 2 especially menstrual impurity. Moreover, their goal, in apparent contrast to the petihat lev rituals in the manuals, is to bring a potent angel—the Prince of the Torah—to the practitioner.72 It is this angel, adjured by the divine names held by the rabbi-magician and acting under God's author­ity, who bestows upon the human being extraordinary skill and cosmic secrets. The main antecedents to Sar-Torah texts, therefore, are rituals that concern the summoning of a figure for divination or related purposes.73 Divination in ancient mediterranean society was mostly carried out through essentially semiotic means—the casting of lots, interpretation of dreams, bibliomancy, physiognomy, chiromancy, and so on. Jewish divina­tion practices were no exception.74 There is an extensive literature con­cerning numerical lots (,goralot) often related by its authors to the Urim and Thumim of the Temple or the esoteric practices of Ahitophel.75 These means do not require an angelic messenger to tell the practitioner what he or she wants to know. Thus traditions of angelic divination are different in kind, in that the practitioner does not \"decode\" information available by divinitory procedure, but is told directly by heaven. A common angelic divination practice, mentioned in the Talmud and detailed in medieval European and Middle Eastern Jewish sources, con­cerns the vision of the \"Princes of the Thumb and Princes of the Cup.\" These rituals, which have been analyzed by Samuel Daiches and Joseph Dan, follow a pattern in which the practitioner places oil on the thumbnail or in a cup and gets a young boy or pregnant woman to look into it and envision the form of a man who appears. Daiches shows that this practice had its roots in ancient Babylonian divination texts, and Dan shows how it was incorporated into the mystical theology of the Haside Ashkenaz.76 A ritual text in the Hekhalot corpus that appears among dream-inquiry texts is designated for divination.77 After prescribing a regimen of fasting for three days and reciting certain biblical verses nighdy, the text continues: \"On the third night, take this book in your hands and recite these names three times with the verses. And afterwards, lie on your shoulders, for 72 Cf. the adjuration of the \"Prince of Forgetfulness\" in the manuscripts of Seder Rav 'Amram quoted above. 73 On such practices see R. J. Zwi Werblowsky, Joseph Karo: Lawyer and Mystic (London: Oxford University Press, 1962), 38-50, on precedents for Karo's cultivation of a maggid; see especially pp. 46-48 on angelic figures and dream divination. 74 See Trachtenberg,Jewish Magic, 208-29. 75 For examples of the goralot literature see Meir Backal, ed., Sefer Goralot 'Ahitofel ha-Shalem (Jerusalem: Backal, 1965); idem, ed., Goralot 'Urim ve-Tumim ha-Shalem (Jerusa­lem: Backal, 1966). 76 Samuel Daiches, Babylonian Oil Magic in the Talmud and in the Later Jewish Litera­ture (London: Jews College, 1913); Joseph Dan, itiSare Kos ve-Sare Bohen,'\" Tarbis 32 (1963). 77 §502."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"MEMORY, TORAH, AND MAGIC 49 immediately the image of a man will come to you and tell you all you wish to know, whether it be a great thing or a small thing.\" This idea has numerous parallels in mediterranean magic, most notably the paredroi, or \"assistants,\" who are the subject of several rituals in the Greek Magical Papyri.78 Such a practice also probably lies behind talmudic accounts of rabbis who fasted so that a \"man of dreams\" ('ish halom),79 or \"master of dreams\" (ba'al halom)80 would come to them in their sleep. Dream divination often, though not always, involved the adjuration of a specific angel.81 Similarly, necromancy had a mantic purpose; people brought up spirits of the dead so that they could give them information.82 In Tosefta Ma'aser Sheni 5:9 a man fasts so that he might find the tithed produce that his late father had hidden.83 However, a \"man of dreams\" appears to him and tells him that the rabbis will not accept the produce obtained in this way, for things learned in dreams \"have no [legal] consequence\" (Io' ma'alin ve-lo' moridin).&4: Talmudic tales clearly reflect the belief that the dead know something we do not. These traditions are related to the Sar-Torah phenomenon in two ways. In both, the intermediacy of the angels is the key to acquiring knowledge of divine origin. Furthermore, revelation and divination have an ancient association that may go back to prebiblical times. This is suggested by Zvi Abusch in a recent article that demonstrates the correlation between the Akkadian alaktu—\"oracular decision\"—and halakhah—the rabbinic sys­tem of legal decision and action.85 In later times, the divinitory faculties of 78 On this phenomenon see Leda Jean Ciraolo, \"Conjuring an Assistant: Paredroi in the Greek Magical Papyri,\" Ph.D. diss, University of California, Berkeley, 1992. 79 See, for example, t.

CONCLUSIONS For ancient Jews the power of memory was bound up with one of their culture's deepest values—the study of Torah. Therefore, the magical tra­ditions were shaped by the mythic dimensions of Torah in that culture. In light of the relationship of the Sar-Torah literature to the practice of Torah, two factors will inform our study of this literature: the prominence of narrative in the major Sar-Torah traditions, and their emphasis on the cultivation of angels for the acquisition of Torah and memory. Both have antecedents in magical and rabbinic literatures, and those literatures will prove valuable in understanding the Sar-Torah phenomenon. The Sar-Torah tradition developed a distinct set of symbols, ideal fig­ures, and variations of midrashic tradition. These are manifest in the narra­tive texts in Hekhalot literature that concern the Sar-Torah practice.

There, too, redactors have inte­grated the Sar-Torah materials into the broader framework of the ascent to heaven, descriptions of the cosmos, and instructions for the learning and recitation of divine names. Because of this, it is necessary to analyze the Sar-Torah and related passages in their complexity, and from there to pro­ceed to the issues of ritual and self-conception. This analysis will include closely related materials as well, particularly rituals and stories concerning the cultivation of the Sar ha-Panim, the reci­tation of the \"great name\" and divinitory rituals.

THE TEXTS Sar-Tomh Texts in Hekhalot Literature The following group of texts appear among the major texts in the Synopse and concern the Sar-Torah. Most are narrative texts in which a rabbi is instructed in the proper Sar-Torah procedure. THE CHAPTER OF RABBI NEHUNIAH BEN HA-QANNAH The most widely distributed Sar-Torah complex is story of Rabbi Nehu-niah's instructions to Rabbi Ishmael regarding acquisition of skill in Torah, which is called Pereq Rabbi Nehuniah ben ha-Qannah (The Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah ben ha-Qannah) in MS. Vatican 236 (§307).1 This com­plex consists of two versions. The first (version A) is appended to Hekhalot Rabbati at §§278-80 and at §§677-79 in Merkavah Rabbah (on which see below). The second (version B) appears in §§307-14 in one principal manuscript. 1 For more information about the manuscripts cited here, see Schafer, Synopse, viii-xxii; idem, Geniza-Frogmente; and idem, \"Handschriften zur Hekhalot-Literatur,\" Frankfurter Judaistische Beitriige 11 (1983): 113-93."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"54 CHAPTER 3 MERKAVAH RABBAH A set of brief Sar-Torah traditions occurs in a Hekhalot miscellany that has come to be known as Merkavab Rabbah.2 This text appears at §§675-873 in three principal manuscripts: MSS. NY JTSA 8128 (NY 8128), Oxford 1531 (Oxf. 1531) and MS. Munich 40 (M40). §§675-76 consists of a testimony regarding the acquisition of the esoteric secrets contained in the following tradition. It includes a hymn, which is parallel to §544 in Ma'aseh Merkavah and which is analyzed in Chapter 4 below. §§678-79 are practically identical to Version A of the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah. §§680-87 consists of instructions for the Sar-Torah praxis (§§680-84), followed by an account of Rabbi IshmaePs reception before the divine throne (§§685-87). MA'ASEH MERKAVAH Ma'aseh Merkavah, one of the most important Hekhalot texts, is a com­plex of separate texts that have been redacted together into the framework of dialogues between Rabbis Akiba, Ishmael, and Nehuniah concerning the ascent to heaven and encounter with the Sar-Torah and Sar ha-Panim or MaPakh ha-Panim. This text exists in two principal recensions. Both recensions include a Sar-Torah section (§§560-70). In this writer's study of Ma'aseh Merkavah, it has been designated as Section II. The text opens (§554) with a hymn which is related to the Sar-Torah hymn in Merkavah Rabbah in §§675-76.4 In addition, §§560-65 is closely related to the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah and follows its general structure.5 In addition, one manuscript of Ma'aseh Merkavah (MS. NY 8128) con­tains an Aramaic Sar-Torah text that was inserted between Sections 2 and 3. This text is not an integral part of Ma'aseh Merkavah, and so was not analyzed in that study. However, it is relevant to this investigation as it is not related directly to the other principal Sar-Torah texts and includes unusual Sar-Torah practices and motifs. This text will be analyzed sepa­rately from the Rabbi Nehuniah complex in Chapter 5 below. HEKHA LOT IiABBATl §§281-307 Hekhalot Rabbati can be considered the paradigmatic Hekhalot text. The major portion of Hekhalot Rabbati depicts a stage-by-stage journey, here called a descent, through the Hekhalot to the divine throne. However, most recensions of Hekhalot Rabbati include texts of other genres as well, 2 On Merkavah Rabbah, see Peter Schafer, \"Prolegomena zu einer kritischen Edition und Analyse der Merkavah Rabba,\" FJB 5 (1977): 65-101. 3 On the determination of the end of this section, see the analysis in Chapter 4. 4 See Swartz, Mystical Prayer, 107-10. 5 Ibid., 86-89."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"THE TEXTS 55 including a widely distributed story of the \"Ten Martyrs,\"6 and other me­dieval apocalypses.7 Among these appendixes to the ascent text of Hekhalot Rabbati is a Sar-Torah story that is significant both for its narrative and the ritual it describes. This story appears at §§281-307 in all of the manuscripts published in the Synopse. In this story, attributed to Rabbi Ishmael in the name of Eliezer the Great, the secret of the Sar-Torah is revealed to Zerubbabel and the sages of the Second Temple at the Temple site (§§297-98). The narrative is in­troduced by a poetic dialogue (§§281-94) between the angels and God concerning the prospect of revealing the secrets of Torah to Israel. This story also served as a source for a polemical poem entitled Sefer Milhamot Adonay, \"The Book of the Wars of the Lord,\" by the tenth-century Karaite writer Salmon ben Yeruhim.8 Other instructions by Rabbi Nehuniah follow the Zerubbabel story at §§298-307.9 HOTAM HA-MERKAVAH (THE \"OZHAYAH FRAGMENT\") This unique set of Genizah fragments, first published by Gruenwald and then by Schafer, contains a series of treatises and short passages regarding the ascent to the Merkavah and the Sar-Torah.

HEKHALOT ZUTARTI §336 AND §340 A brief passage relevant to the Sar-Torah tradition occurs in the compila­tion known as Hekhalot Zutarti.16 This passage, which occurs in §336 in MSS. NY 8128, Oxf. 153lj M40, Dropsie 436 (D 436), and Munich 22 (M22), contains a brief petition to God to open the heart of the individual not only to words of Torah, but to \"any other words in the world.\" This passage is represented as having been taught by God to Moses when he ascended to heaven. MAGICAL TEXTS IN THE CAIRO GENIZAH Also relevant to our examination of the Sar-Torah tradition are texts in the Cairo Genizah that adjure the Sar-Torah or provide instructions for such adjurations. Some of these are brief fragments found on separate leaves, like amulet texts, and many of these appear in magical handbooks. These texts are significant as they attest to the persistence of the Sar-Torah tradi­tion and to the active use of such rituals. Texts of this type will be consid­ered as they bear on particular topics in the course of this study.

MANUSCRIPTS OF THE SAR-TORAH TEXTS Manuscripts of Hekhalot Literature Among the manuscripts known to us, the narrative Sar-Torah traditions appear only in manuscripts containing Hekhalot literature: that is, manu­scripts that include ascent and related texts in the Hekhalot corpus. Extant manuscripts of Jewish magic that do not include these ascent traditions also lack Sar-Torah narratives—although they may include incantations for the Sar-Torah. Manuscripts of Hekhalot literature can be divided into two categories: 1. Those copied mosdy in central and southern Europe, stemming principally from the Haside Ashkenaz and published in the Synapse or listed elsewhere by Schafer.19 These manuscripts display a good deal of affinity in their organization of Hekhalot material. Within this group, some subde distinc­tions can be observed. For example, MS. M22 often varies from the other manuscripts published in the Synopse in organization of materials and in wording.20 2. Those found in the Genizah from North Africa and Islamic countries and published in Geniza-Fmgmente and other places.21 These manuscripts or-17 This section of the principal Hekhalot manuscripts includes the Great Name incanta­tion (about which see below), dream incantations, and others. 18 Schafer, Geniza-Fragmente, 163, citing M.

Striking examples can be found in Genizah manuscripts of Hekhalot Rabbati and 3 Enoch.22 The Sar-Torah Tradition in the Manuscripts The principal narrative texts such as the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah and the Hekhalot Rabbati Sar-Torah narrative are found primarily in the Eu­ropean family of manuscripts. The Genizah fragments preserve a few ech­oes of the Sar-Torah tradition. These occur in individual incantations for the Sar-Torah unrelated to a narrative framework and, in the case of the Ozhayah fragments, are worked into a more encompassing narrative about the visitor to heaven. SYNOPSIS OF THE TEXTS The following set of tables illustrates the classification of the major Sar-Torah texts in the manuscripts of the Synopse and the relationships between them. These tables cover the various versions of the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah and the Sar-Torah texts in Merkavah Rabbah and Hekhalot Rabbati. The Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah Complex In Table 1, the pericopae of the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah are arrayed so as to delineate the relationships between the various versions and to indicate the parallel between that complex and the narrative structure of Ma'aseh Merkavah. The upper portion of that table illustrates version A and the lower portion version B. The lower portion illustrates the struc­ture of the Merkavah Rabbah Sar-Torah section and its parallels with the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah and Macaseh Merkavah. Numbers placed be­tween braces ({}) do not appear in that order in the manuscript, but are parallel to the pericopae opposite to which they are located in the table. The implications of this distribution are then analyzed. The Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah consists of a basic narrative unit set into different contexts. This unit consists of three paragraphs (§§278-80=677-80; cf. 308-9). The third paragraph, §280, is mostly elided in MS. M22 and does not appear in §309. Version A occurs at the end of Hekhalot Rabbati in MSS. B238, M22, and V228. In the former two manuscripts it comes between the ascent section of Hekhalot Rabbati (§81-277) and the Hekhalot Rabbati Sar-Torah text (§281-306); in MS. V228, it follows after the Hekhalot Rabbati Sar-Torah story. In MS.

This collection includes a second version of the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah (Version B).24 This distribution of material corresponds to what we know about these manuscripts from other textual studies. In Ma'aseh Merkavah, for example, the longer recension appears in MSS. NY 8128, Oxf. 1531, M40, and a fourth, MS. Dropsie 436, which does not include Merkavah Rabbah and thus lacks its version of the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah. The shorter re­cension of that text is represented by MS.

The Hekhalot Rabbati Sar-Torah Text The Hekhalot Rabbati Sar-Torah text appears in the principal manuscripts of Hekhalot Rabbati. Schafer has identified several recensions of Hekhalot Rabbati according to the distribution of sections in the text in the princi­pal manuscript groups.26 This text appears as the last unit of the shortest recension,27 and is included in all of the longer recensions.

MANUSCRIPTS OF THE SAR-TORAH TEXTS: CONCLUSIONS The narrative Sar-Torah texts form a complex of interrelated pericopae rather than cohesive and unified works. This is especially true of the Chap­ter of Rabbi Nehuniah texts, in which basic units are combined in different ways. Although the principal narrative sections of the Hekhalot Rabbati Sar-Torah text appear in all manuscripts, redactors or scribes have added other units to that text at various places. This textual state indicates the composite nature of the Sar-Torah texts. Independent units have been combined in different ways by redactors for different reasons. While this redactional trait is characteristic of Hekhalot literature as a whole, it is particularly pronounced in these texts. The tex­tual analysis undertaken in the next two chapters will therefore pay atten­tion both to the integrity of the individual units themselves and the program of the redactors who arranged them. Form-critical criteria will aid us in understanding how and why these texts took shape, and what they may have meant to those who composed and arranged them. 28 Cf. the interpolated Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah in the same manuscript at §271."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 SAR-TORAH NARRATIVES: TRANSLATION AND ANALYSIS THE FIRST category of Sar-Torah texts examined here consists of narra­tives depicting the revelation of the Sar-Torah praxis and the instruction of rabbis in the techniques. Hekhalot literature differs from other magical texts in introducing this narrative framework. There are two major narrative Sar-Torah patterns. One, which will be called the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah complex, occurs in several places in the Hekhalot corpus and is worked into the structure of Section II of Ma 'aseh Merkavah. The other text tells quite a different story, about the revelation of the Sar-Torah at the Temple site. This text, which will be called the Hekhalot Rabbati Sar-Torah text, is appended to Hekhalot Rab-bati in several manuscripts. These translations follow an outline form. Each translation is accom­panied by a form-critical analysis explaining the redactional principles, lit­erary parallels, and genres informing the passage, and the major themes of the text. The first set of stories we shall examine tell of how Rabbi Ishmael ac­quired the Sar-Torah secrets from his teacher, Rabbi Nehuniah. These sto­ries are the most common in the Sar-Torah corpus and set the pattern for the genre. They will serve to introduce the major themes of the phenome­non. We shall then proceed to an extensive Sar-Torah narrative that bears distinctive literary and historical characteristics. THE CHAPTER OF RABBI NEHUNIAH COMPLEX Stories concerning Rabbi Nehuniah's instructions to Rabbi Ishmael about the Sar-Torah appear in varying forms with Hekhalot Rabbati and Mer-kavah Rabbah. The tide Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah appears only in §307. However, to draw attention to the fact that these passages constitute a complex of textual units, they have been designated Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah A (§§278-80) and Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah B (§§307-14) and will be studied together with their parallels in Merkavah Rabbah and Macaseh Merkavah."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"SAR-TORAH NARRATIVES 63 Version A: §§278-80 Version A is found at §§278-80 in MSS.

ANALYSIS Like all Sar-Torah narratives, this story is about the success of the magic of the Sar-Torah in transforming a poor student into a great one. In the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah complex, Rabbi Ishmael tries unsuccessfully to attain this skill on his own, and must be instructed by Rabbi Nehuniah in the Sar-Torah technique. The narrative setting is established in I A, stating Rabbi IshmaePs diffi­culty in retaining what he learns—which, presumably, is the problem for which the reader would seek out this text. In A 2 he tries to rectify the problem by fasting and abstention. In this case, the purpose of Rabbi Ish-mael's fast is to express his distress and contrition before God in hopes that He will take pity on him and improve his skills.4 In B Rabbi Nehuniah shows Rabbi Ishmael a more effective way of retaining his knowledge: He should swear by the \"great seal and great oath\" mentioned in B 1. C and D testify to the success of the magic. C describes his proficiency in learn­ing, and in D he declares that the value of this incantation, which he has \"established\"—that is, transmitted to future generations, down to the reader—is commensurate to all his erudition in Torah, for it allows Israel to learn Torah effortlessly.5 This story takes place in the Temple in Jerusalem. Rabbi Nehuniah takes his young colleague into the Chamber of Hewn Stone, which was the meeting place for the Sanhedrin according to m. Mid. 5:4. The Temple is the setting for most of the extant narrative Sar-Torah texts; the most strik­ing example is the Sar-Torah text of HekhalotRabbati, which takes place at the site of the unbuilt Second Temple in the time of Zerubbabel. In that text, the Temple location is an integral part of the narrative. The elders complain of having to study Torah while at the same time building the Temple; by means of the mystery of the Sar-Torah they are able to alleviate that burden. In the main ascent narrative of Hekhalot Rabbati (§198 and following), Rabbi Nehuniah's journey to the Merkavah takes place in the Temple. There the literary context is an apocalypse in which Rabbi Nehu-niah descends to the Merkavah for the purpose of understanding Israel's fate. In our text, the setting of the Temple does reinforce the notion that Rabbi Ishmael receives an extraordinary revelation—one in which there is 4 The purpose of fasting in this literature is discussed in Chapter 6. 5 The logic employed here can be compared to that implied in a well-known statement in m. Pe'a 1:1 (cf. b. Qid. 39b): talmud torah ke-nejjed kulam, \"the study of Torah is equivalent to all [the other good deeds in that list]\"—because it leads to them all. In an analogous way, this magic is said to be equal to all other Torah, because it leads to its proliferation."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"SAR-TORAH NARRATIVES 65 a visionary element.6 But its major purpose is to validate the Sar-Torah ritual and emphasize its solemnity and orthodoxy. A talmudic source places Rabbi Ishmael in the Temple in a similar fash­ion. In b. Ber. 7a Rabbi Ishmael enters the Holy of Holies to offer incense and sees \"Akhatriel, YH, YHWH of Hosts\" seated on a throne. In both cases, our Sar-Torah texts and the talmudic story, the narrative setting is an obvious anachronism, and the implication that Rabbi Ishmael was the high priest7 is a conspicuous historical error. Scholem notes that \"the real Ish-mael was still a boy at the time of the destruction of the Temple\" and offers a very plausible suggestion as to the origin of this anachronism.8 T. He/. 1:10 implies that Rabbi Ishmael's father Elisha was the high priest. Scholem suggests that the father's title was later applied to the son.9 If the authors of the Sar-Torah stories began with this designation in mind, it would not have seemed far-fetched to place him in the Temple.10 The purpose of the narrative is clearly to validate the magical names and recommend them to the reader. In his remarks on this passage, Halperin records his impression that this story has \"a very modern ring to it,\" and likens it to toothpaste advertisements that credit a young woman's success in romance to her use of the advertised brand.11 Stories like the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah do indeed function as advertisements. In fact, counter­parts to this narrative form can be found closer to this source, in ancient and medieval magical and esoteric literature. Magical texts, Jewish and other, abound in \"historiolae\"—literary patterns that commend their techniques or lore to the reader by attesting that particular historical fig­ures performed the miracles or attained the powers for which they are famous by means of the magic or esoteric techniques contained in the very text the reader now holds.12 This topos can take the form of a brief refer­ence to a biblical hero, or a literary pattern such as the \"chain of tradition\" in the Merkavah Rabbah Sar-Torah unit in §§675-76. This and related 6 On the Temple as a locus of visionary experience, cf. Wolfson, Speculum That Shines, 19-20. 7 Cf. Lev. 16:2-3. 8 Scholem, Major Trends, 356 n. 3. 9 Perhaps Rabbi Ishmael ben 'Eltsha kohen gadol came to mean, \"Rabbi Ishmael son of Elisha, the high priest\" rather than \"Rabbi Ishmael, son of Elisha the high priest.\" Cf. t. Men. 13:20 which inveighs against priestly families, including \"the House of Elisha.\" 10 The problem of historical anachronisms and their implications for the study of this literature is discussed in Chapter 7. 11 Halperin, Faces of the Chariot, 377. 12 For an early definition of the historiola see F. Ohrt, \"Segen,\" Handworterbuch des deutschen Aberglabens (Berlin/Leipzig: De Gruyter, 1935-36), 7:1590-91. My thanks to David Frankfurter for this reference. See further the more extensive discussion of this form in Chapter 7."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"66 CHAPTER 4 means of validation and recommendation are analyzed in depth in Chapter 7. In our story, as in all narrative Sar-Torah texts, the need for validation inspires a distinct narrative genre in which a rabbi's celebrated erudition is ascribed to the magic of the Sar-Torah. This pattern, for example, forms the structure for the Sar-Torah section of Ma'aseh Merkavah (Section II), which is related to this complex. That the primary concern of the author is to introduce the reader to the proper ritual actions is evident from a curious detail in A 2. Rabbi Ishmael tells us that he abstained from sexual relations—this from a thirteen-year-old boy who lives in his father's house. While it is possible that the author presumed that young Rabbi Ishmael was married, it is more likely that his wish to give the reader comprehensive instructions about what activ­ities were to be avoided in such situations prevailed over his interest in verisimilitude.13 This passage does not make it clear, however, exactly what the great seal and great oath are. It is possible that they involve the names of the angel in B 1. However, one would expect the story to be followed by a more elabo­rate incantation such as the prayer of the \"Great Seal and Awesome Crown,\" which comes after Version B at §§318-21.14 What does follow in these two manuscripts, however, is the Hekbalot Rabbati Sar-Torah story in §§281-306 in which a \"seal\" and \"crown\"—that is, magical names— are revealed to the elders of Israel. It is possible, therefore, that the scribe of the Vorlage of these two manuscripts wished to use this narrative as an additional testimony to introduce the more impressive Sar-Torah unit in Hekhalot Rabbati. The angel is called Zekhuriel in this version of the story. This name, based on the verb zkr, \"remember,\" seems to be a scribal variant of an­other common name for the Sar-Torah, Zevudiel, and is quite appropriate for a praxis, the purpose of which is to improve one's memory.15 However, the name Zevudiel is more prevalent in these texts than Zakhoriel and we cannot be sure whether one is derived from the other. Sar-Torah narratives often employ terms for rabbinic study. Here they are prominent in A 1. The verb qr' refers to the study of Scripture; snh 13 This sort of incongruity may have led the author of the brief ritual passage in Hekbalot Zutarti §424 to stipulate how both unmarried and married men were to avoid sexual pollu­tion: \"youths\" were to avoid seminal emission, and married men were to stay away from their wives. Cf. Halperin, Faces of the Chariot, 375. On §424 see Chapter 6 below. 14 The prayer of the \"Great Seal and Awesome Crown\" also appears in Merkavah Rabbah §§651-54.

SUMMARY This brief story, a fundamental building block for the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah complex, contains the basic elements of Sar-Torah narratives: Rabbi Ishmael's ascetic ritual, Rabbi Nehuniah's instructions to his stu­dent regarding a magical name, and the transformative power of that name. The story of that name's success in making the young Rabbi Ish-mael into a great scholar serves as an advertisement to the reader. Chapter of Rabbi Nebuniah Version B: §§307-14 Version B of the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah appears only in MS. V228 at §§307-14. This text incorporates a variant of the basic unit found in §§278-80 into a larger composition. This larger text also includes a second story of Rabbi Nehuniah's instructions to Rabbi Ishmael at §§313-14, which follows a narrative pattern much like that of Version A. Thus the text contains two similar narratives, interspersed with instruc­tions for performing the ritual. Following the translation below, this struc­ture is examined in detail. TRANSLATION I. (§307) The Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah ben ha-Qannah, which he taught to Rabbi Ishmael: A. Who can tell the mighty deeds of YWY, and who can proclaim the praise17 of the King of Kings?—these are the ministering angels.18 16 On the term talmud, see Hanokh Albeck, Mavo Ia-Talmudim (Tel Aviv: Dvir, 1969), 3-7. The term also appears in the Sar-Torah hymn in §§675-76 (Merkavah Rabbah) and its parallel in §544 (Ma'aseh Merkavah). 17 Ps. 106:2. 18 This last clause is a parenthetical gloss explaining the phrase melekh malkhe ha-melakhitn, literally \"king of the kings of kings.\" The word melakhim, \"kings,\" is taken here as mal'akbim, \"angels,\" that is, God is the king of the kings of angels. These two words are often conflated in magical and other texts; see Schiffman and Swartz, Incantation Texts, 74-75. On this rabbinic and liturgical appellation melekh malkhe ha-melakhim, see Swartz, Mysti­cal Prayer, 119 n. 40 and the sources cited there."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"68 CHAPTER 4 II.

End. ANALYSIS This text is introduced with a superscription (I) containing the title \"The Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah,\" and concludes with seliq, \"end.\" The text has been divided by the scribe or his Vorlage into two major sections, the second of which is designated as \"Chapter Two\" in the manuscript at §310. The first section (II) is the parallel to Version A (§§308-9). The second (III-VI) consists of three appended instructions and testimonies at III-V (§§310-12) and an additional narrative at VI (§§313-14). This latter story tells how Rabbi Ishmael conjures the Sar-Torah, who, after interrogating him, teaches the correct procedure. The redactor intended to link two separate Rabbi Nehuniah narratives (II and VI). He did so using two sets of instructions (III and V) and a testimony (IV). Those three unrelated paragraphs supplement the instruc­tions in II and provide further affirmation of the authority and power of the magic. Taken together, the two separate Rabbi Nehuniah stories can be read sequentially. That is, it is possible to read the entire text as telling how in VI, after Rabbi Ishmael used the incantation mentioned in II, he was still vexed about its details. He therefore conjured the Sar-Torah, who instructed him in the proper procedure. Nonetheless, VI, like the three units preceding it, was composed independently of the first Rabbi Nehu­niah story in II. At II A, there are minor differences between this text's version of the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah and Version A in §278. For example, in §278 the verbs qr3 and snh are applied to the terms miqra, and mishnah respec-28 This clause is in Aramaic. It is unclear whether, as is supposed by this translation, the following instructions are the continuation of Yofiel's speech, or the Aramaic clause is an editor's interpolation introducing the narrator's instructions for the praxis following the pre­ceding object lesson.

Hekhalot Rabbati §98."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"SAR-TORAH NARRATIVES 71 tively, whereas in §308 the object of both verbs is the noun miqra.30 From B, however, the variation is more significant. The following illustrates these differences: PRNA B.(§280) 1. Immediately Rabbi Nehuniah seized me and took me from my father's house and brought me into the Chamber of Hewn Stone, 2. and made me swear by the Great Seal, by the Great Oath 3. that is for Zakhoriel YYY, God of Israel, who is Metatron, YYY, God of Israel, God of Heaven and God of the earth, God of gods, God of the sea and God of dry land, 3. and he revealed the praxis of the secret of Torah. C. Then immediately my heart was enlight­ened {like the gates of the east, and my eyes gazed into the depths and paths of Torah, and never again did I forget any­thing my ears heard from my teacher, of study; nor would I ever again forget any­thing of the paths of Torah in which I engaged for their truth. D. (§280) [testimony by Rabbi Ishmael regarding the value of the praxis] PRNB B. (§309) Rabbi Ishmael said: 1. Immediately Rabbi Hehuniah seized me and took me from my father's house and brought me into the Chamber of Hewn Stone, 2. and made me swear by the Great Seal, by the Great Oath, 3. in the name of YD NQWP YD NQWY YD HYRS YD SWQS, by His Great Seal, by Zevudiel YH Akhatriel YH, in heaven and earth. C. And when I heard this great mystery, my eyes were enlightened and all that I heard—whether it be scriptures, Mishnah, or anything—I would not forget any more. The world was renewed {for me} in purity, and it was as if I had come into a new world. D. (§310) [Rabbi Ishmael instructs the reader on how to use the adjuration] III. [Further instructions] IV. [Testimony concerning the preceding] V. [Further instructions] At B, both the names of the angel and the framework into which it is placed differ in the two versions. In Version A, these names are listed in the context of the Rabbi Ishmael's descriptive statement that Rabbi Nehuniah made him swear by the Great Crown. In Version B, different names are listed, and they are cast as an adjuration formula beginning be-shem, \"in the name of.\" This formula is a common one for introducing potent magi­cal names in magical incantations.31 In contrast, the praxis of the Sar-30 Another minor variation occurs in §278, where Rabbi Ishmael states that \"Torah was not remaining with me\" ('en ba-Torah 'omeAet bi), whereas in §308 he says, \"my study was not being sustained in me\" ('en talmudi mitqayyem be-yadi). 31 See Swartz, \"Scribal Magic,\" 172-73."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"72 CHAPTER 4 Torah is not mentioned in version B. This may be an indication that the redactor of that version, noticing that the story did not contain the actual incantation it recommends, wished to introduce it at this point, whereby the redactor of version A intended the praxis to follow. Following C, Rabbi Ishmael's description of his enlightenment, the par­allel with version A ends. Whereas Version A concludes with a testimony by Rabbi Ishmael, Version B continues at D with what looks like a brief incantation for Metatron, including two lists of his names (1 and 2). The second list is introduced by the statement that the following names were given to him by the other angels because of their love for him.32 D con­cludes with an important biblical passage (3) and a liturgical blessing (4). Exod. 34:6-7, Moses' declaration of God's attributes at Sinai, is employed at particular occasions in the standard Babylonian Jewish liturgy, including the ceremony of taking the Torah scroll from the ark at festivals. This verse would therefore be appropriate for a Sar-Torah ritual. Biblical verses are also used in magical incantations to lend them power and authority. These verses are usually relevant to the purpose of the incantation.33 The bless­ing Hakham ha-Razim, \"Sage of mysteries,\" appears in several Merkavah and Sar-Torah prayers, including Hekhalot Rabbati and §512, a ritual for pronouncing the divine name.34 The magical names listed in D 1 deserve note. First a series of names is given, explained by a gloss explaining that they are all names of Metatron. Then single components of that name (with slight variations) are then listed and identified with Metatron. The letters MRG of the first name correspond to the first three of MDGWBY'L, and so on. This list includes the name TNRY'L, which also appears in the Hotam ha-Merkavah frag­ment35 as the name of an archangel, and HWZHYH, which may be re­lated to the name SQDHWZYH, which appears in Ma'aseh Merkavah and elsewhere as a name of the Sar ha-Panim.36 The idea of the multiple names of Metatron is one that is reflected in several Hekhalot texts. Specifically, the tradition of the seventy names of Metatron, which has been analyzed by Joseph Dan, appears in Hekhalot literature and associated texts.37 This tradition, moreover, is part of a 32 In Ma'ayan Hokhmah (on which see Chapter 7), Metatron, having once been the human Enoch, is not folly accepted by the angels, who object to his special treatment. 33 On biblical verses in amulet texts see Schiffman and Swartz, Incantation Texts, 35-38 and 55-56, and Trachtenberg, Jewish Magic, 104-13. 34 See Margarete Schliiter, \"The Eulogy Hakham ha-Razim ve-'Adon ha-Setarim in Hekhalot Literature,\" Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought 6 (\\9K7)·. 95-115 (English section). 35 G8 in Schafer, Geniza-Fragmente. 36 The name appears as SQHWZYH in some versions. 37 Joseph Dan, \"The Seventy Names of Metatron,\" Proceedings of the Eighth World Con­gress of Jewish Studies Division C (1982), 19-23. It is possible that this tradition, which appears in 3 Enoch and the Alphabet of Rabbi Akiba, is a Haside Ashkenazic interpolation. Nonetheless, the idea that the archangel has many names is still well attested."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"SAR-TORAH NARRATIVES 73 somewhat broader phenomenon, the profusion of names for the archan­gel. As documented by Gershom Scholem, several characteristics of the archangel are attributed to such figures as Michael and Yahoel as well as Metatron.38 Thus we should not be surprised to see a series of names in our passage, accompanied by the gloss that they are \"all Metatron.\"39 Unit III, the first of three appendixes to II, elaborates on how the pre­vious ritual is to be used. The practice of counting one hundred and eleven times, and no more or less, is known from several Sar-Torah and Hekhalot texts.40 An Aramaic gloss follows explaining that the previous list of names (that is, D 1 in §310) is to be recited up to the quotation of Exod. 34:6-7. He is then to conclude with the blessing follows in III A 4. This blessing is the second benediction in the statutory 'amidah41 Unit IV is a brief testimony to the advantages of using the praxis. This passage is a stereotyped formula with affinities to several passages in Hekhalot literature and elsewhere. For example, a similar statement ap­pears in the ShiiUr Qomah (§940=377) concerning \"anyone who knows this mystery.\"42 More significant, perhaps, is a statement in the Babylo­nian Talmud. In its discussion of the conditions under which the name of God (shem ha-mefomsh) can be taught, b. Qid. 71a enumerates the bless­ings that knowing the forty-two-letter name confers: \"And anyone who knows it and is careful with it and guards it in purity is beloved above and esteemed below, and fear of him rests on [fellow] creatures; and he inherits two worlds: this world and the world to come.\"43 The parallel between the talmudic statement and the passages in the Hekhalot texts is striking. However, given the esoteric subject, it is entirely possible that the testimonies we find in Hekhalot literature are not based on the talmudic passage. For example, Rav, the tradent of the talmudic statement, does not figure in Hekhalot literature. Rather, statements in both corpora regarding the advantages of knowing magical secrets may have common roots. In §311, then, we can recognize a well-attested custom of attributing physical safety, social acceptance, and Divine favor to knowledge of a mag-38 Scholcm, Jewish Gnosticism, 43-55. 39 On the phenomenon of assigning several names to one divine being, see Gruenwald, Apocalyptic, 175 n. 4. 40 The number varies between 111, as in Merkavah Rahbah §681 and our text, and 112, as in Hekhalot Rabbati §205; cf. Ma'aseh Merkavah §590, where the angels are said to recite the name of God 111 times. 41 Note that this blessing, which among other things, declares Israel's faith in redemp­tion, is the occasion for petition of Zerubbabel that prompts the angel to reveal eschatologi-cal secrets to him in the Zerubbabel Apocalypse.

Often, however, these advantages are not mentioned in the text itself. In our case, the benefits of popularity and protection from witchcraft are not essential to the Sar-Torah practice Rabbi Ishmael culti­vates; he is interested in learning Torah. Nonetheless, he—as well as the reader—will profit in unanticipated ways from knowing that practice.44 Unit V, like III, provides additional instructions for reciting the Sar-Torah incantation. It is to be repeated and the phrase \"Blessed are You, teach me Your statutes,\" from Ps. 119—appropriate in the context of a prayer for skill in learning—is to be included. SUMMARY Version B of the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah supplements the basic unit (parallel to version A) with additional testimonies and instructions, and follows with a second story in which the angel descends and instructs Rabbi Ishmael in the proper procedure. The encounter with the angel himself is a significant addition to the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah pattern. The text also contains a detailed ritual of abstentions and ablutions. Ma'aseh Merkavah Section II: §§560-70 Ma'aseh Merkavah is primarily an anthology of prayers. It consists of three narrative sections, one of which concerns Rabbi Akiba's ascent to heaven and two of which concern the encounter with angels. The main Sar-Torah material is found in Section II of that text. This section was translated and analyzed in this writer's study of Ma'aseh Merkavah.45 The principal objec­tives of that analysis were to determine the nature of the prayers in Ma'aseh Merkavah and their relationship to their narrative framework. For a de­tailed account of the redactional history of this section and an analysis of the magical prayers in it, the reader is referred to that study. Here the focus is on the Sar-Torah narrative and the ritual procedure depicted in the nar­rative. Therefore, the narrative of that text is translated and analyzed be­low and the findings of the earlier study regarding its relationship to other Sar-Torah texts are summarized and amplified.

Suriel, the Angel of the Presence, then reveals to him informa­tion about cultivating the Sar-Torah. In Unit VIII (§§563-64), Rabbi Ishmael receives further instructions from the Angel of the Presence and from Rabbi Nehuniah. Rabbi Ishmael cannot endure the forty days of fast required (Unit IX, §§565-68), so he conjures the Angel of the Presence by means of the forty-two-letter name, only to be rebuked by him. Only when he recites the \"twelve utterances\" does the angel grant him wisdom. 49 This is a label referring to the previous name as the Great Seal. 50 MS. MY 8128 adds: wnwtn Iw rswt l$pwt w'ynw nyzwq, \"and He gives him permission to gaze and he is not harmed.\""},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"78 CHAPTER 4 In Unit X, (§§569-70), Rabbi Nehuniah gives Rabbi Ishmael further in­structions for protecting himself from the fierce angels and for gazing at the Shekhinah. This passage, however, does not refer to an ascent. Section II of Ma'aseh Merkavah, like the other Sar-Torah texts we have seen, concerns the procedure for bringing angels of wisdom down to earth. This section is composed of several sources, and its narrative pro­gression is not consistently maintained.51 These sources are indicated by the various names for the Angel of the Presence in the different units of the text. Moreover, the text is interspersed with extensive magical prayers and names. The narrative of this section follows the pattern of the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah complex, particularly the second Rabbi Nehuniah story in Ver­sion B (§§313-14). Unit VII, in which the young Rabbi Ishmael asks Rabbi Nehuniah's advice, corresponds to the opening of §313; the angel's angry descent in Unit IX echoes Yofiel's rebuke there as well.52 The redac­tor of this section of Ma'aseh Merkavah was probably familiar with this narrative pattern, either from literary sources or stories he had heard. It is less likely that he had a written copy of our Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah before him.53 The important difference between the two texts lies in the additional prayers and instructions inserted at various places, particularly at Units VIII and IX. These detailed prayers usually consist of a brief passage of praise, the effective magical name, and a petition for wisdom.54 This dif­ference marks a contrast in emphasis as well. Whereas the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah texts emphasize the effectiveness of the correct ritual procedure performed by Rabbi Ishmael at Rabbi Nehuniah's instruction (§314), the purpose of the narrative of Ma'aseh Merkavah Section II is to demonstrate the power of the magical prayers.55 This emphasis corre­sponds to the nature of Ma'aseh Merkavah as a whole. Its overall subject is how prayers imbued with powerful names can effect the vision of the heavens and the acquisition of wisdom. Unit X (§§569-70) is appended to this story. It concerns a prayer of protection that Rabbi Ishmael is to recite after having performed the Sar-Torah ritual above. It concludes with a brief exchange in which Rabbi Nehuniah assures him that he will be able to gaze at the Shekhinah and be beloved of it. Although the prayer in §569 is a petition for wisdom, and thus appropriate to the Sar-Torah narrative, the reference to a vision of the 51 Swartz, Mystical Prayer, 77-78, 89-90. 52 For an illustration of the parallels and variations, see the chart in ibid., 87-89. 53 Ibid., 89. 54 On this pattern and its implications, see ibid., 185-88. 55 See especially §§566-68, the culmination of the story, in which the successful prayers are provided."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"SAR-TORAH NARRATIVES 79 Shekhinah in §570 does not address an integral concern of this section. Here, the magician's direct encounter with God seems a by-product of the Sar-Torah practice and not an essential part of it. The same holds true, as we will see, for the Sar-Torah section of Merkavah Rabbah.56 Ritual figures prominently in this text. The basic preparation ritual de­scribed in the text is one of abstention accompanied by magical prayers. In Unit VII, I A, the angel instructs Rabbi Ishmael in this ritual. This fast is interrupted after twelve days (Unit IX, §565), when Rabbi Ishmael tries to circumvent the proper procedure by pronouncing the powerful forty-two-letter name as a kind of shortcut. His illegitimate use of the name incurs the angel's wrath. By means of additional spells (the \"twelve utterances\") Rabbi Ishmael is able to endure the fast. The text refers in passing to other ritual actions. Rabbi Nehuniah's in­structions to Rabbi Ishmael in §564 are interrupted by a question: Can anyone endure the procedure? As this question and its answer are not attributed specifically to the rabbis, it is unclear whether the question is supposed to be a rhetorical one in the context of Rabbi Nehuniah's speech, a question asked by Rabbi Ishmael, or, as is likely, part of an anon­ymous gloss inserted by a redactor. The answer is that one should emulate Moses, who wrote letters for his disciple Joshua, whereupon he drank them. The discipleship of Moses and Joshua, which in this case extends to magical teaching, also echoes that of Rabbi Nehuniah and Rabbi Ishmael. Moses' ritual act is consistent with well-attested magical practices for wis­dom and other benefits. For example, the Aramaic Sar-Torah text in Ma'aseh Merkavah consists mainly of instructions for writing magical names on various objects or substances, which are eaten and drunk. This technique is explored in Chapter 2 above. The redactor of this section, as in other sections of Ma'aseh Merkavah, is apparently concerned with the danger of the procedure. Repeatedly the text expresses the concern that the practitioner may not be able to endure it. It is evident from the account of Rabbi Ishmaei's attempt to circumvent the fast that the narrator considered forty days to be a long duration. But there is also a concern with magical danger.57 Like many texts in Hekhalot literature, this text describes elaborate actions and spells whose purpose is to allay the wrath of the fierce angels that guard the heavenly secrets. One of these is a ritual of standing in a circle, an apotropaic action known from talmudic and other sources.58 This section also refers to seals placed on the body to protect the individual from the angels. This detail reflects an an­cient practice of placing apotropaic marks on the foreheads or bodies of 56 See below. 57 On the implications of the idea of the danger of the magic, see Chapter 7. 58 See Gruenwald, Apocalyptic, 185 n. 15."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"80 CHAPTER 4 the believers so that the destructive beings would pass them by. As Meir Bar-Ilan has shown, this practice extends from biblical times, as attested in Ezek. 9:4, through the literature of early Christianity and early rabbinic Judaism, to Hekhalot literature.59 This practice is written into the text of one of the magical prayers. In §566 the seven seals with which Rabbi Ishmael sealed himself are enumerated. These are magical names to be placed on separate parts of the body—perhaps by writing them on the flesh:60 'WRYS SSTYY on my feet; 'BG BGG on my heart;61 'RYM TYP' on my right arm; 'WRYS TSY Y'H on my left arm; 'BYT TL BG 'R YYW DYW'L on my neck; 'WP 'K QYTR SS 'HD YDYD YH, for the protection of my life, and above them all, 'P PT YHW HYW YW ZHW YHW TYTS: a seal above my head. The prayer culminates in a general seal for protection, and a seal above the head, which assures that the angels looking down will not harm the practi­tioner. These apotropaic practices, however, are attested primarily in allu­sions found in the text. Unlike the abstention rituals, they are not set forth as detailed instructions. Section II of Ma'aseh Merkavah also contains the most extensive Sar-Torah prayers in the corpus. An important element of these prayers is the magician's declaration that he will recite the divine name. Unlike the prayers in the ascent texts of Ma'aseh Merkavah, the prayers in Section 2 were composed for the purposes attributed to them in the narrative: to induce the angels through magical names to obtain wisdom and skill in Torah for the practitioner.62 These prayers, more than many in Hekhalot literature, emphasize the theme of divine wisdom brought down from heaven to the magician. Two passages (in §562) provide examples: You formed Magnificent Ones of wisdom, who have permission to bring down the secrets of wisdom by the authority of Your name; I have pronounced the name of §QDHWZYH Your servant so that there may be miracles, wonders, many marvels, 59 Meir Bar-Ilan, Hotmot Magiyyim cal ha-Guf 'esel Tehudim be-Me'ot ha-Rtshonot Ie-Sefirah, Tarbis 57 (1987): 37-50.

For wisdom is before You. Here the apotropaic nature of the prayer and its function in securing wis­dom for the petitioner are linked. SUMMARY Section 2 of Ma'aseh Merkavab attests to several aspects of the Sar-Torah tradition. It follows the narrative structure of the Chapter of Rabbi Nehu-niah complex in which Rabbi Ishmael learns, through the tutelage of his master and the angels, the Sar-Torah practice. It includes a detailed ritual procedure and alludes to other ritual practices. It also contains an unusual set of Sar-Torah prayers. The section's composite nature is evidence that the redactor of the text incorporated a variety of Sar-Torah motifs and practices known to him. However, this section also reflects the particular perspective of the authors of Ma'aseh Merkavah, according to which prayers, combined with powerful divine names, are the primary instru­ments to affect ascent or aquire wisdom. Merkavah Rabbah §§675-87 A loosely organized assortment of Sar-Torah, Merkavah, and Shi'ur Qpmah traditions known as Merkavah Rabbah contains a Sar-Torah collec­tion beginning at §675. This collection includes a version of the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah, supplemented with hymns and additional narrative and ritual instructions. It is difficult to know where this section ends, as the relationship of the last few passages (§§675-87) to what precedes them is uncertain. A recension of the Shi'ur Qomah follows at §688.63 The following translation is based on MS. Oxf. 1531. Better readings or significant variants from MS.

(Isa. 6:3) ANALYSIS This text can be summarized as follows: I. (§§675-76): A Sar-Torah hymn praising God as the one who handed down secrets to Moses and through him to Israel. II. (§§677-79): Version A of the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah; almost ex­actly as in §§278-80. III. (§680): Brief testimony concerning Rabbi Ishmael's enlightenment. IV-V. (§§681-84): Rabbi Akiba sends Rabbi Ishmael to inquire of Rabbi Nehuniah concerning the procedure in II; Rabbi Ishmael gives further instructions. VI. (§§685-87): Account of Rabbi Akiba's vision of the Divine Throne and concluding hymn attributed to Rabbi Ishmael (cf. Hekhalot Rab-bati §94 and §154). These six units are separate passages that have been placed together by a redactor. They are not well integrated, but they can be seen as following a sequence. The first serves as an introduction to the Sar-Torah tradition. The second (II) is the central unit, providing the rationale for the text and the ritual to be followed. The third unit (III) attests to the transformative power of the praxis in II. The fourth and fifth units (IV-V) are additional instructions and testimonies that have been attached to the preceding Sar-Torah collection by means of the narrative device of Rabbi Akiba's inquiry. In VI Rabbi Akiba seeks further knowledge of the technique at the Divine throne. His reception at the heavenly court serves to recommend the praxis to the reader, and, as we will see, to link it to the Shi'ur Qomah material that follows at §688. The first unit (I) consists of an introduction (A-B) and the Sar-Torah hymn in C. A tells of the benefits, in this world and the next, of reciting the \"mystery.\" This term, raz, may refer to the prayer in C, which is to be included in morning prayers, or to the entire ritual of I and II. B contains instructions and moral prerequisites for reciting the prayer.83 It also in-83 On lists of moral requirements see N. van Uchelen, \"Ethical Terminology in Heykhalot-"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"SAR-TORAH NARRATIVES 87 eludes a promise cast in the first person: \"and I will be with you every hour and every time and every moment, and at every season.\" It is difficult to tell whether God or an angel is supposed to be speaking in this clause. The hymn in C follows patterns of Hekhalot hymnology found in Ma'aseh Merkavah and similar texts.84 It begins at 1 with an opening salu­tation using second-person hitpa'el verbs and continues at 2 with a state­ment that God reigns on his exalted throne. This poetic clause is similar to passages in the hymns of Ma'aseh Merkavah that tell of God's establish­ment of heaven and earth.85 At 2-5 the hymn introduces Sar-Torah themes. In the \"chain of tradition\" in 2-4 the mysteries of Torah are said to be revealed through Moses and the rabbinic succession to all Israel. This passage and the form it represents are discussed in depth in Chapter 7 below. Five is a purpose clause stating that these secrets are to be used so that Israel can \"increase study [talmud] with them.\" At 6, the theme shifts to that of Israel's praise of God, which is declared to be a further purpose of the esoteric teachings. Divine names and phrases describing the heavenly retinue follow in 7-9. These include the word raz, \"mystery,\" setarim, \"secrets,\" hai, \"living,\" and obscure combinations of letters resembling magical names that have their origins in Greek.86 It is difficult to tell whether they are all the names of the angel or mysterious phrases included for effect. SQDHWZYH appears as a name for the Sar ha-Panim in various sources including Section III of Ma'aseh Merkavah. The final couplets in 10 provide a rationale for the prayer: they state that by means of the praise of God's name—that is the hymn itself with the Divine names—one can acquire esoteric wisdom. This idea is similar to the conception of prayer in the narrative of Ma'aseh Merkavah, where reciting the hymns in the text are said to effect ascent to heaven.87 But in the case of Merkavah Rabbah the prayer is effective not for ascent but for acquiring the arcana of Torah. The blessing, praising God as the sage of mysteries (Hakham ha-Razim), reinforces this theme. Thus this hymn, while echo­ing the mystical prayers in Ma'aseh Merkavah, is thoroughly consistent with the themes of Sar-Torah practice. This hymn is also parallel to the prayer in §544, which opens Ma'aseh Merkavah.

The secrets are said to have been made available directly from Moses to all Israel. A redactor of Ma'aseh Merkavah added the prayer at §544 to bring Section I, an ascent text, into harmony with the other sections, which concerned the Sar-Torah. Unit II is practically identical to Version A of the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah (§§278-80).89 For the redactor of this section of Merkavah Rabbah, this unit seems to have served as the centerpiece of the text, around which he added the introduction in I and appendices in II. The prayer in I was, in his view, to be recited together with the Sar-Torah ritual prescribed in II. He also saw Rabbi Nehuniah as providing additional de­tails for that same ritual in III B and Rabbi Ishmael as supplementing those details in IV and V. Rabbi IshmaePs statement in III testifies to the success of the ritual procedure in II. Both versions of the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah contain similar descriptions of Rabbi Ishmael's enlightenment. Here the three ver­sions are compared: PRNA (§279=MR §678) Then immediately my heart was enlightened like the gates of the east, and my eyes gazed into the depths and paths of Torah, and never again did I forget anything my ears heard from my teacher, of study; nor would I ever again forget anything of the paths of Torah in which I en­gaged for their truth. PRNB (§309) And when I heard this great mystery, my eyes were en­lightened and all that I heard—whether scriptures, Mishnah, or anything—I would not forget any more. The world was renewed {for me} in purity, and it was as if I had come into a new world. MR (§680) When my ears heard this great mystery, the world was transformed for me for purity, and my heart was such that it was as if I had come into a new world. And each and every day it seemed to me as if I were standing before the Throne of Glory. Both versions of the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah emphasize the types of Torah study that Rabbi Ishmael now has at his command. Version A em­phasizes his ability to retain what he has heard from his teacher and his mastery of advanced study (talmud). Version B lists the categories of sa­cred texts and traditions that he has learned. Both versions also stress that this skill has somehow transformed Rabbi Ishmael into a newly enlight­ened person. In Merkavah Rabbah it is indeed his heart, that is, his intel-88 Ibid., 109-10. 89 The only meaningful variation between these two versions is that these manuscripts have sha'are ha-mizrah, \"gates of the East,\" for \"sha'are ha-mizbeah in §280.

There, however, Rabbi Ishmael's joy is emphasized over his knowledge of Torah; his bliss is such that it is as if he were standing before the divine throne itself. This added detail may have allowed the redactor of this com­pilation to introduce the traditions in §685 a little further down, in which Rabbi Akiba descends to inquire of the Merkavah, and finally advances to the vision of God in Shi'ur Qomah §688 and following. The affinity with Shi'ur Qomah proceeds in IV, which introduces Rabbi Akiba, one of the tradents of Shi'ur Qomah traditions. The narrative de­picts an exchange in which a student asks a question of an elder teacher on behalf of another teacher. Rabbi Akiba sends Rabbi Ishmael to get further knowledge about the ritual set out in II from Rabbi Nehuniah. They must get this information so that they will not suffer the fate of certain anony­mous persons (peloni 'almoni), whose \"bile dissolved within them.\" This cryptic passage can be elucidated by comparison with Hekhalot Rabbati §104, in which the physical dangers faced by those who are in the presence of angels are described.90 From this hymn, which enumerates the heavenly voices and their destructive powers, we can see how the process that harmed peloni 'almoni might have been seen to operate: The fifth voice: Anyone who listens to it is immediately spilled [as from] a ladle, and he dissolves entirely into blood. The sixth voice: Anyone who listens to it is immediately seized by a spear91 to his heart, and it makes his heart quake and transforms his viscera, and his bile dissolves92 inside him, turning to water. The term Aeqirah may be related to the pharmacological term me de-qirah, literally \"spear water,\" a medical preparation which is said, accord­ing to b. Shab. 110a, to \"spear the gall.\" According to Preuss's Biblical and Talmudic Medicine,93 such potions were seen to act by means of af­fecting the tension between what is \"solid\" and \"loose\" in the organs. By this conception, corresponding to the humoral medicine common in Greco-Roman antiquity, liquefying the gall would thus alter the person's equilibrium. Furthermore, an excess of bile in the body could be fatal. In b. 'Abod. Zar. 20b the angel of death is said to stand over the dying person with a sword at the end of which is a drop of bile, which he drops into the person's mouth when he opens it in fright.

In our Sar-Torah text, the organs of the anonymous unfortunates were dissolved into poisonous bile. This reference is reminiscent of stories told in the Talmud, 3 Enoch, and Hekhalot Zutarti concerning the heretic Elisha ben Abuya.95 In the Tal­mud and 3 Enoch, Elisha mistakes Metatron for a second \"power in heaven\" and is punished. These stories often function to warn the prospec­tive traveler to heaven to avoid Elisha's fate. In the Hotam ha-Merkavah fragments a similar warning is stated explicitly, although neither Elisha ben Abuya nor Metatron is mentioned 96 As it turns out, Rabbi Akiba was prudent in asking Rabbi Nehuniah's advice. Rabbi Nehuniah declares that it was only Rabbi Ishmael's priestly descent that saved him from oblivion 97 Rabbi Nehuniah gives his admo­nition in the form of an aphorism: \"One adjures servants by their king, and one adjures a slave by his master.\" Its meaning—that one must use the names of God to conjure the angels—is understood by Rabbi Akiba in C to have a specific application to the ritual. He therefore commences to enumerate the one hundred and eleven divine names, as in the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah B (§310).

They are not presented explicitly as having been the result of Rabbi Akiba's inquiry, and they appear to be independent of each other. The statement that they are to be recited \"by every student who knows this mystery\" probably means that they are additional rituals to be performed in con­junction with the previous procedures. A is a ritual of prayer and anoint­ing. In addition to early recitation of the statutory morning Shema', the practitioner is to recite the names of Metatron at his bed.99 These names are listed in 2a; they include §QDHWZYH and Zevudiel, which are com-94 See Pruess, Biblical and Talmudic Medicine, 187-88. 95 See b.

At 2b, Isa. 6:3 is quoted, without any direct statement about its relevance. It is probably included here to indi­cate that the names are to be recited with the liturgical qedushah. Set 3 is a fragmentary allusion to jjezerot, a term for magical commands to the su­pernatural powers, which, according to MS. NY 8128, the individual is to issue to the angels.100 B and C both specify the requirements for reciting the names in A. B lists the moral prerequisites, and C sets forth the proper ritual procedure, which, unlike the ritual in A, is one of abstention. In VI Rabbi Akiba descends to the Merkavah, presumably for the purpose of inquiring about the praxis that puzzled Rabbi Ishmael and him. However, it is difficult to tell exactly what the author meant Rabbi Akiba's request to be. The syntax of VI A is obscure; it begins with what may be a petition—\"if it please Zevudiel, YY . . . \" to be followed by a request—or, perhaps, the prodasis of a conditional declarative statement: \"If Zevudiel . . . wishes,\" to be followed by what he would do in that case. But the passage continues with a description of the angel and con­cludes with Exod. 34:6. At B we find him before the throne of glory, where he is assured by God that He has been waiting for him all along. In C, Rabbi Ishmael introduces an additional hymn to accompany the praxis. The Shicur Qomah recension follows. These units bear signs of influence of the Hekhalot Rabbati tradition. At VIA Rabbi Ishmael reports that Rabbi Akiba \"descended,\" employing the characteristic term for travel to the Merkavah in Hekhalot Rabbati.101 The hymn in VIC is an excerpt of a qedushah hymn found in Hekhalot Rabbati §94 and §154. But the presence of these fragments of the Hekhalot Rab-bati tradition in these units do not indicate that our text originated in that tradition, nor that it is prior to the ascent texts of Hekhalot Rabbati. The structure of the prayer in §685 resembles certain prayers in Ma'aseh Mer­kavah Section II in that it consists of a brief passage of praise, a string of divine names, and a closing blessing with liturgical connotations.102 Indi­vidual fragments of hymns from Hekhalot Rabbati were also incorporated secondarily into prayers in Ma'aseh Merkavah.103 Our section, therefore, was composed by someone familiar with the Hekhalot Rabbati tradition as it had developed, but not by the same circles that produced it. Sar-Torah elements are also used secondarily here. They are limited to the inclusion of names for Metatron in §685 and God's approval of their purpose in §687. 100 On the verb gzr; see Swartz and Schiffman, Incantation Texts, 75, and the sources cited there. 101 On yrd, see the studies listed in n. 18 of the introduction above. 102 See Swartz, Mystical Prayer, 185-88. i\"3 Ibid., 192-94."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"92 CHAPTER 4 The author or authors of those units evidently intended the Sar-Torah narrative that began at §307 with Rabbi Nehuniah's instructions to culmi­nate in Rabbi Akiba's ascent, in which he is assured of God's desire for humans to perform the Sar-Torah practices. This allows the redactor of this section to link the Sar-Torah units I—III, which do not involve an ascent and vision of God, with the Merkavah and Shi'ur Qomah traditions that follow, in which that vision is the primary concern. Rabbi Akiba's ascent indeed provides validation for the magic of the Sar-Torah. But it does not necessarily follow, as Halperin suggests, that this validation is the foundation for the ascent traditions, or even the major factor in explaining their function.104 The ascent passage is a late pastiche, secondary both to the Sar-Torah and Shi'ur Qomah traditions. It serves primarily to reinforce the legitimacy of the former and introduce the latter. SUMMARY This loosely organized collection of Sar-Torah and related traditions con­tains the principal elements of the Sar-Torah texts we have seen including the narrative of Rabbi Ishmael's instruction, prescriptions for abstention rituals, and names of Metatron. However, Merkavah Rabbah emphasizes Rabbi Ishmael's enlightenment and introduces Rabbi Akiba, who is other­wise not a major figure in Sar-Torah narratives.105 It also contains a sig­nificant Sar-Torah prayer. Moreover, in linking the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah story with the vision of God in the Shi'ur Qpmah, the redactor of Merkavah Rabbah has applied the theme of the ascent to the throne and the vision of God to the Sar-Torah literature. Rabbi Akiba's ascent is un­dertaken in order to clarify a detail in the praxis, and God Himself declares His desire to see Israel become wise by means of it. This redactor has taken two traditions that had flourished before him and brought them together. THE HEKHALOTRABBATI SAR-TOBAH TEXT: §§281-306 This Sar-Torah narrative, which is appended to the ascent section of Hekhalot Rabbati, differs from other Sar-Torah texts in several ways. Though attributed to Rabbi Ishmael in the name of Rabbi Eliezer the Great, this text begins with a story that takes place not in the time of these early rabbis but at the beginning of the Second Temple period. That story also includes an unusual poetic dialogue between God and Israel. This text thus bears certain similarities to the Hebrew apocalypse Sefer Zerubbabel, which seems to have been written in seventh-century Palestine.106 104 See Halperin, Faces of the Chariot, 381-83. 105 For example, Rabbi Akiba does not appear in Ma'aseb Merkavah Section 2, although he is prominent in Section 1. 106 See below. However, the detail in §305 that the magic was successful outside the Land of Israel may indicate a Diaspora provenance, at least for that passage."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"SAR-TORAH NARRATIVES 93 As shown in Chapter 3 above, this text exists in two main recensions. At §§295-96, the scribe of MS. B238 has also inserted an unrelated testi­mony concerning Metatron/Enoch, which also appears in MS. NY 8128 at §§405-6. A version of this text was also available to the Salmon ben Yeruhim, who included a poetic parody of the story in his Sefer Milhamot Adonay. The text consists of four main sections. The first, §§281-98, tells the story of the revelation of the Sar-Torah at the Temple site. This consists of a prologue containing the poetic dialogue (I, §§281-94) and the account of God's revelation to the community (II, §§297-98). The second section (III, §§299-303) presents the ritual itself. The third (IV, §§304-5), which appears only in the longer recension, testifies to the benefits of the ritual. The fourth section (V, §306) is a hymn, which concludes the text at §306 in all manuscripts. This translation is based primarily on MS. B238, supplemented by other readings.107 The translation of §306 is augmented by the parallel in §153. As MS. B238's addendum at §§295-96 is not part of this text, it is not translated here.

From the day when the Torah was given to Israel until the Latter House108 was built the Torah was given but its beauty and pre-ciousness, glory, greatness and adornment, its awe and fearsome-ness, wealth, and pride and dignity were not given until the Latter House and the Shekhinah did not dwell in it. B. (§282) Israel stood to pour its tribulations before their Father in heaven, saying: 1. \"You have cast many troubles down on us. Which shall we seize and which shall we abandon? You have cast upon us great toil and a heavy burden. You have said to us: 'Build me a House. And even though you are building, engage in Torah.'\" C. This is His answer to His sons: 1.

ANALYSIS This complex text includes unusual narrative and poetic elements, an im­portant set of ritual instructions, and echoes of prophetic and apocalyptic motifs. It is made up of compositional units that have been redacted to­gether to form a coherent whole. Unit I functions as a poetic prologue to II, which presents the story of the revelation of the secret and introduces the ritual procedure in III. As the ostensible purpose of the text is to present this ritual, the composition properly culminates in III. Units IV and V are appendixes: IV testifies to the extraordinary success of the ritual, and in V a hymn to be recited during the procedure is attached. Unit I concerns God's decision to reveal to Israel the magical secret of learning Torah at a prodigious rate. The introduction (I A) states that although the Torah was given, its full glory was not revealed until the Second Temple. This \"glory\" is described in the profusion of synonyms characteristic of Hekhalot texts such as Hekhalot Rabbati: \"its beauty and preciousness, glory, greatness and adornment,\" and so on. These nouns probably refer to the magical techniques used to learn Torah.145 This statement, echoed in II by the use of Hag. 2:9, is notable, as is the Second Temple setting, for its implications for sacred history in rabbinic literature. Rabbinic opinion is divided on whether the Second Temple was inferior to the First Temple.146 The most prominent source on this ques­tion is a discussion in b. Yoma 9b-10a, in which it is said that the Shek-hinah did not dwell in the Second Temple because it had not been built by the people of Israel themselves.147 However, there are statements that imply that the Shekhinah did dwell in the latter temple as well; according 145 Cf. Gruenwald, Apocalyptic, 170, who takes this phrase to refer to the oral Torah. However, the passages below, in which Israel complains about their labor in Torah and in which Israel is said to yearn for halakhot and talmud, presuppose that the Oral Torah was already known to them. 146 For a list of sources on this question see Wertheimer, Bate Midrasbot 1:112. 147 The comment is based on an exegesis of Gen. 9:27: even though God \"enlarged Japheth\" by making the Persians the instigators of the building of the Temple, the Shekhinah only dwells \"in the tents ofShem,\" the sanctuary built by Israel. In the Zohar (Bereshit 28a), however, this idea is used to assert the greatness of the Second Temple. There it is stated that the First Temple was built by human beings, but the latter house by God."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"SAR-TORAH NARRATIVES 103 to b. Yoma 39a, the western lamp of the menorah was lit miraculously all night during the forty years that Simon the Just served as High Priest.148 However, it is unusual to ascribe greater sanctity to the Second Temple. Hag. 2:19, which figures in II below, is usually interpreted in a minimal fashion in rabbinic literature—for example, by taking it to mean that the physical dimensions of the Second Temple will be larger than those of the first.149 In our text, however, the revelation of the magical secrets for the study of Torah adds glory to the Latter House. The statement in this introduction that the Torah had already been given not only places the episode in historical sequence, but serves the poem that follows, which echoes the motif of the rivalry between the an­gels and Moses regarding reception of the Torah.150 In this case no one hero ascends to heaven to receive the \"glory\" as in the Moses legends. Rather, Israel is to receive the secrets collectively. However, a debate be­tween the angels and Israel (or the angels and God over Israel) does occur in these legends as in this text. God's decision to impart the secret is initiated by Israel's complaint (I B) of the double burden of building the Temple and studying Torah. God concedes (C) that the punishment of exile has been too severe, and has caused Israel to neglect the study of Torah. In compensation, he will reveal to them the secret, which will not only allow them to study produc­tively but confer fabulous powers and status on them. This decision is opposed by the angels (D), who, like the angels who opposed Moses' reception of the Torah, argue that this precious secret belongs properly with them. In E God refutes their argument and declares that Israel will be rewarded with his precious secret. In II the scene shifts to earth, specifically to Jerusalem, where the elders are preparing to build the Temple. They compel God to reveal to them \"the secret of the Torah.\" The verb used here, zqq, \"compel,\" clearly has a magical connotation. It is often applied to adjurations of the angels, where it means to obligate supernatural beings to do one's will by means of a magical name.151 The setting depicted is that described in the book of Haggai.152 The narrative serves to explain why the elders were reluctant to begin the work of building the Temple, necessitating Haggai's exhortation: They felt they could not do so and engage in the study of Torah at the same time. Al-148 That this is a sign of the Shekhinah can be seen from b. Shab. 22b. 149 See, for example, y. Meg. 1:12 (72d), b. B. Bat. 3a. 150 On this motif, see Chapter 6. 151 See Gruenwald, Apocalyptic, 101. 152 This setting is indicated by the use of Hag. 2:15 in the first sentence of the narrative. On the chronological problem involved in setting this scene according to that verse cf. Sifre Num. Be-ha'alotkha 64 (ed. Horowitz, p. 61), y. Rosh Hashanah 1:1 (56a)."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"104 CHAPTER 4 though God speaks directly to the elders in this scene, the medium for the revelation of the magical names themselves is Zerubbabel. The ac­tual names of the Sar-Torah—presumably, those names that Zerubbabel recited—are listed below in III (§301). These are considered to be the efficacious names in this ritual. Zerubbabel appears in Haggai both as one infused with the Holy Spirit and as a messianic figure. In addition, he is the hero of apocalyptic texts written in Hebrew in Byzantine Palestine. Sefer Zerubbabel, which was written in Palestine in the early seventh century C.E., depicts Zerubbabel as the receiver of eschatological secrets concerning the coming wars be­tween the nations.153 However, this affinity is not clear evidence of Pales­tinian provenance for this Sar-Torah story. There are no signs of its direct dependence on the Sefer Zerubbabel outside of the mere fact that Zerub­babel is used as the prophetic figure. In our text he does act as a conduit for the divine word. However, here the message consists of the names of the Sar-Torah, not the drama of history. Moreover, as Joseph Dan points out, Zerubbabel does not play a major role in the story. He does not represent Israel as a spokesman of God or as a prophet; rather, Israel is collectively the party in the dialogue with God.154 There is one detail in Sefer Zerubbabel that is reminiscent of Hekhalot literature: the angel who reveals the secrets to Zerubbabel is identified as \"Michael, who is Meta-tron.\"155 Paradoxically, though, Metatron does not play this role in our Sar-Torah text. The only specific way the Zerubbabel apocalypse intersects with the Sar-Torah tradition is that in the apocalypse, God grants Zerub­babel the vision of the future after the latter has recited the second blessing of the amidah, \"Blessed are You, YHWH, who revives the dead.\"156 This recalls the brief ritual statement in the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah B §310, in which the recitation of the names concludes with that blessing. The inclusion of Zerubbabel in this Sar-Torah text, then, is not the result of direct literary influence from the Apocalypse of Zerubbabel. Rather, it is appropriate to the historical setting in which Zerubbabel has a 153A good introduction to Sefer Zerubbabel can be found in Martha Himmelfarb's trans­lation: \"Sefer Zerubbabel,\" in Rabbinic Fantasies: Imaginative Narratives from Classical Hebrew Literature, ed.

The same image of Zerubbabel, that of a prophet who was able to receive divine inspiration at the temple site, evi­dently prompted the authors of both texts to depict him in this way.157 Zerubbabel's inspiration and announcement of the names of the angels is similar to Rabbi Ishmael's behavior upon his enlightenment in Section III of Ma'aseh Merkavah. In §580, Rabbi Ishmael, in response to Rabbi Nehuniah's vision, asks of him the names of the Princes of Wisdom. As a result of asking this question, his heart is enlightened. At that point, he relates, \"when I stood on my feet and saw my face shining because of my wisdom, I began to elaborate [the name of] every angel in every Hekhal\" (§581). Like Zerubbabel, Rabbi Ishmael recites the magical names auto­matically as a result of his enlightenment. In Ma'aseh Merkavah, this reve­lation comes as a result of the process of dialogue concerning the secrets of heaven that characterizes the narrative structure of that text. In our story, God conveys the proper names to the community through Zerubbabel as a result of Israel's having obligated Him to do so. In contrast to the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah, the temple setting is essential to this story. God's throne itself descends as a result of Israel's conjuration. A gloss in B 1 refers to God's presence in the temple as the Shekhinah, whose descent is the ideal result of temple worship in Jewish cultic theology. The author uses God's declaration in Haggai 2:9 that the Second Temple would be greater than the first in a novel way: He declares that its added greatness lies in the fact that Israel is able to obligate God by magical means to grant them the secrets of learning. Both I and II share thematic and narrative concerns. Unit I clearly in­troduces the revelation of the Sar-Torah ritual in II—III, and II presup­poses that Israel is in need of a way to alleviate the difficulty of studying Torah while building the Temple. Yet despite this continuity, there are indications that these two units were not composed together. While I and II follow in sequence according to the narrative, they differ in style and emphasis. The poetic form and vocabulary of I are not characteristic of II. In fact, there are possible contraditions between the two units. Compare the introductions to I and II: I(§281) A. 1. From the day when the Torah was given to Israel until the Lat­ter House was built, the Torah was given but its beauty and pre-157 Zerubbabel's status as a prophet was probably more influential in this text than his Davidic lineage. There are few places in Hekhalot literature in which kings of Israel or their descendants are recipients of esoteric traditions or travelers to the Merkavah. David is men­tioned in a fragmentary line in G22; see Gruenwald, uQetaHm Hadashim,'\" 368. Cf. §347 in Hekhalot Zutarti, also a difficult passage."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"106 CHAPTER 4 ciousness . . . were not given until the Latter House and the Shekhinah did not dwell in it. B. (§282) Israel stood to pour its tribulations before their Father in heaven. II (§297) A. Our fathers had not taken it upon themselves to put one stone on top of another in the Temple of YHWH until they compelled and obliged the King of the universe and all His servants to reveal to them the secret of the Torah. In I, Israel initiates God's decision to reveal the secret by its complaint. They are not aware of a magical technique for learning Torah; they are only aware of the hardship imposed on them because of their duties. In II, they \"compel\" (zqq) God to reveal to them the magic. Moreover, II stands on its own as a narrative. It does not presuppose the introduction in I A, but supplies its own setting. It is likely, then, that these two accounts were separate units that were placed together in sequence. A detail in II may be evidence of this redactional process. The flow of the introductory narrative is broken at Bl by a gloss: B. At once the Holy Spirit appeared from the third entrance in the House of YHWH 1. —for the Shekhinah did not descend and dwell in the Holy of Holies because of the decree. The gloss in 1 refers to God's decree on Israel since the exile. Although this detail is inessential to the narrative in II, it is a major theme of I. This gloss may have been added by a redactor or scribe who wished to bring the two narratives into greater correspondence. A similar gloss appears in the following sentence, in 2 a. This gloss was inserted by a redactor or scribe who needed to explain how the Shekhinah could appear in a particular place if it had not yet been built. This incongruity is explained with re­course to the idea that the plan for the temple had been laid out in the time of Ezekiel.158 Unit III presents the ritual itself. The unit begins with the ascription to Rabbi Ishmael in the name of Rabbi Eliezer, but contains no reference to the Temple setting. Rather, the introduction simply lays out the procedure for the benefit of \"whoever wishes to bind himself to the Prince of the Torah.\" This shift from the \"historical\" narrative to recommendation of the praxis is familiar to us from Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah B. Following the first story of Rabbi Nehuniah's instructions to Rabbi Ishmael, the text 158 See Schafer, Obersetzung, 2:284 n. 36."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"SAR-TORAH NARRATIVES 107 presents the names in this way: \"And now, any student whose study is not sustained in him should stand and bless and rise and adjure\" (§310). This pattern serves to link the story, which validates the magic and tells its origins, with the ritual to be employed by the reader. However, because in this case the historical setting is not mentioned, there is no indication that this passage was composed together with I and II. The procedure itself consists of two stages. A 1-3 is a preparatory ritual of ablution, isolation, and diet. This preparation is called a fast (ta'anit) in B. In B he is to recite the midmsh of the Sar-Torah every day of this preparatory period. This probably means that the practitioner is to recite, presumably from memory, the Sar-Torah text itself, including the narrative of the origins of the praxis and the angelic names.159 One effect of this regimen would probably be to fix the magical names in his memory. It is to be recited after \"the prayer,\" that is, after the statutory iCimidah, the prayers of petition known as tefillah.160 In III E (§303) it is claimed that the practitioner, after having com­pleted the ritual successfully, will be able to \"proceed to any aspect of Torah he wishes: whether to Scriptures or Mishnah, or gazing at the Mer-kavah.\" For Halperin, this is an indication of the close relationship be­tween the Sar-Torah and Merkavah traditions.161 However, there are indications that this passage represents a late synthesis of the two tradi­tions. This statement resembles several passages scattered through mysti­cal literature, late Midrashim, and other texts regarding the scholastic curriculum.162 One of the most prominent appears in the midrash to Proverbs (Midrash Mishle), chapter 10. This text has been dated to the ninth century.163 The midrash enumerates the subjects for which each man will be held accountable in the world to come. If he has studied scripture and not Mishnah he is punished.164 Ifhe knows several orders of Mishnah, God will ask if he had studied all of halakhah. The interrogation progresses, according to the accomplishments of the individual, up a scale of what the author considers progressively higher levels of learning. This scale culminates in the \"vision of the Merkavah\": 159 Cf. §485 where the practitioner is instructed to read the text from a book as part of the ritual. 160 Cf. the inclusion of the second blessing of the amidah in Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah B §310. 161 Halperin, Faces of the Chariot, 434. 162 See the sources cited in Burton L. Visotzky, Midrash Mishle (New York: Jewish Theo­logical Seminary of America, 1990), 81-82, commentary. 163 Visotzky, Midrash Mishle, 7. For a translation, see Burton L. Visotzky, The Midrash to Proverbs (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1992), 56-58. 164 This detail—indeed, perhaps the entire passage— may be a polemic against the Ka­raites, who rejected the \"oral Torah\" and disdained the anthropomorphism of the Shi'ur Qomah.

The Midrash goes on to elaborate the details of the mystical curriculum, including the feet of the divine throne, the heavenly bridges, and the Shi'ur Qomah traditions concerning the measurements of the body of God.165 This is an unusual depiction of a mystical curriculum in the early post-talmudic period. It is relevant to our passage because it derives from a later period in the development of Merkavah mysticism when the vision of the Merkavah was considered by some to be a normative subject.166 So too, Merkavah Rabbah is a composite of the Sar-Torah and ascent traditions. Having inherited both the magical and visionary streams of Hekhalot liter­ature, its redactors included the latter in its endorsement of the former. 165 For parallels in Hekhalot literature to this passage, see Visotzky, Midmsh to Proverbs, 139-40. 166 Even so, this idea was hardly accepted universally.

The texts presented in this chapter are evidence for the Sar-Torah phenomenon, but present it through a variety of literary forms and themes. SAR-TORAH RITUAL TEXTS Several Sar-Torah texts consist of little more than an attribution to a sage and instructions for a Sar-Torah or related ritual. Ritual Sar-Torah texts demonstrate the interplay between the more purely narrative components of the Sar-Torah tradition and the magical aspects. Because many of the mythic elements of the Sar-Torah tradition—the images of the rabbis, the motif of the student who becomes a great scholar through the magic of the angels—are absent, they can show us more plainly the ritual basis on which those narratives rest. §§571-78: The Aramaic Sar-Tomh Text in Ma'aseh Merkavah A set of instructions for a Sar-Torah procedure written in Babylonian Ara­maic appears in only one manuscript of Ma'aseh Merkavah, MS.

There is thus no narrative to speak of. The purpose of the ritual, as stated in I A, is to grant \"wisdom and understanding.\" The incantations in II are more specific, asking for skill in studying Scripture, Mishnah, and Talmud. There are two separate sets of instructions. The first (§§571-72) con­sists of a brief incantation to be recited with the forty-two-letter divine name (A) followed by a ritual of fasting, special diet, and immersion (B) to accompany that name. The second (§§573-78) lists incantations to be written on five objects or substances. These objects are listed in A; B-F specify the incantations for each of them. Each of these incantation pas­sages (except perhaps §577) is organized in the following way: it begins with a brief instruction for writing the names; the names and incantation, including the petition for wisdom, follow; and it concludes with instruc­tions for eating or drinking the substance with the magical name. G, at the end of §578, is the final stage of the ritual, involving a fast after eating the egg. The goal of the ritual procedure is thus to ingest the magical names, which, thus internalized, will give a person the extraordinary skill he re­quests in the incantations. The ritual instructions and incantations signify at several points that they are for the specific purpose of acquiring skill in Torah. The fasting ritual at I B 1 specifies that the student is to fast from the new moon of Sivan to the festival of Shavuot (cAsent), which celebrates the revelation of the Torah at Sinai. The ritual in I B 2-4, however, bears no indication of that event. In II, the incantations to be written on the objects or recited over the wine include explicit petitions for skill in Torah, using language akin to the testimonies in the narrative Sar-Torah texts we have seen. The practitioner is to adjure the angels that he not forget what he has learned, that he retain Scripture, Mishnah, and advanced study (Talmud), and that he be fluent in oral recitation: \"Let me not stumble with my tongue in all I learn.\" Metatron is mentioned in B, Yahoel in E, and the \"great Prince of the Torah, who was with Moses at Sinai\" in F. In many ways, then, this passage presents a complete Sar-Torah practice. However, this unit is striking not in its affinity to the themes of the Sar-Torah texts we have studied, but in several dissimilarities. This ritual is quite different from those found in the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah com­plex and Hekhalot Rabbati in that it involves specific materials, such as the fig and olive leaves, and because it involves the drinking of wine and pro­hibits sleeping alone. Most of the other rituals in the corpus involve absti­nence, including from wine, and some sort of seclusion."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"114 CHAPTER 5 In contrast to these deviations from the pattern of the rituals in the principal Sar-Torah narratives, details of these rituals bear similarities to rituals found in the magical rituals for memory discussed in Chapter 2 above. These rituals too involve writing magical names on substances, dis­solving them, and ingesting those substances.24 As we have seen, the use of eggs also follows patterns of magical divination texts documented by Samuel Daiches.25 The language in this text has certain affinities with that of the narrative of Ma'aseh Merkavah. For example, §571 mentions \"righteousness and piety in your heart,\" which is also a condition for the ascent in Ma'aseh Merkavah. However, there is every reason to conclude that it was a sepa­rate passage inserted by the scribe of MS. NY 8128 or its Vorlage. In addition, the Aramaic has strong Babylonian features. These factors would argue for a late, Geonic provenance for the text. Sar-Torah instructions in Hekhalot Zutarti (§336 and §340) In the compilation of Hekhalot traditions known as Hekhalot Zutarti, there appears a brief passage containing an incantation to be used by any­one who falters in his studies. This passage appears in the principal manu­scripts of the Synopse in §§336-37 and occurs again, with some variations, in MS. NY 8128 at §340. This passage is a prayer for memory similar to the petitions for petihat lev discussed in Chapter 2 above. It is notable because, unlike most other Sar-Torah narratives, it is presented as having been taught to Moses. Hekhalot Zutarti is a collection of disparate Hekhalot traditions in Ar­amaic and Hebrew, most having to do with the vision of God and the powers of the supernal letters. The text was published in the Synopse and by Rachel Elior.26 Although Gershom Scholem supposed Hekhalot Zutarti to be the earliest Hekhalot text,27 this view has not been substantiated.28 Furthermore, Peter Schafer has shown that the text, like others in the corpus, is not a unitary document.29 Our passage appears near what is considered to be the beginning of the text. The previous passage, §335, advertises the value of the text that is to follow and at the same time warns 24 There is another example of ingesting names in Ma'aseh Merkavah. In Section 2, §564, Rabbi Akiba tells Rabbi Ishmael that in order to protect him during a dangerous conjuration, \"Moses wrote three letters [that is, magical names] for Joshua and he drank.\" 25 See Daiches, OilMajfic, Dan, \"Sare Kos\" and the discussion in Chapter 2 above. 26 Schafer, Synopse, §§335-74; Rachel Elior, Hekhalot Zutarti. 27 Scholem, Major Trends, 45 and note. 28 See Schafer, \"Tradition and Redaction,\" 9-10. 29 Schafer, \"Aufbau und redactionelle Identitat der Hekhalot Zutrati.\""},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"RITUALS AND RELATED TEXTS 115 of misusing it.30 This passage could be taken as the beginning of Hekhalot Zutarti or, as MS. NY 8128 has it, the conclusion of Hekhalot Rabbati.31 The passage that follows, §337, is a testimony concerning the magical name \"that was revealed to Rabbi Akiba, who would gaze at the work of the Merkavah,32 when Rabbi Akiba descended, and he taught it to his students.\" Rabbi Akiba proceeds to instruct them to use the name care­fully, in awe and humility, and promises that anyone who uses it properly will be successful and have many children. Neither §335 or §337 mention Sar-Torah concerns. The significance of this omission can be understood by examining MS. TS K21.95B (=G7), a Genizah fragment containing material from Hekhalot Zutarti. This fragment proceeds directly from the end of §335 (fol. 2a, lines 1-2, where the extant text begins in the frag­ment) to §337 (lines 3-6). This fact, taken together with the absence of Sar-Torah concerns in those passages and the parallel to §336 in §340, suggests that §336 is an independent set of Sar-Torah instructions placed by a redactor of HekhalotZutarti or a later scribe between the testimonies in §335 and §337.33 The second version in §340 precedes a series of Merkavah traditions introduced in §341 as the \"book of wisdom and understanding and knowledge . . . of above and below . . . that has given to Moses the son of Amram with the knowledge of YH.\" The material that follows includes Aramaic Merkavah and name traditions and the story of the four rabbis who entered into pardes. §336- TRANSLATION The following translation of §336 is based primarily on MS.

NY 8128 is not integral to the passage. B contains the instructions. The purpose of the praxis is to secure memory for a student who is having difficulty retaining his learning—whose \"heart errs.\"38 In A the praxis for reciting the name is described as having been taught to Moses \"when he ascended to God.\" This phrase is taken from Exod. 19:3, in which Moses' approach to Sinai is described in those terms. MS. Oxf. 1531 contains an interesting variation: Mosbe 'alah Ia-Marom 'el ha-'Elohim, \"Moses ascended on high, to God.\" That is, not only did Moses ascend the mountain, but to God's heavenly abode. This idea forms an important foundation for a set of midrashim depicting Moses' vicissi­tudes during his heavenly journey to receive the Torah. These midrashim, as we shall see, constitute important evidence for the role of ritual and tradition in the Sar-Torah and related literatures.39 The idea that when Moses ascended \"to God\" he received magical tech­niques for learning Torah is attested in several sources in Hekhalot texts and other corpora. The Sar-Torah prayer in Merkavah Rabbah and its par­allel, which opens Ma'aseh Merkavah, present the Sar-Torah traditions as having been transmitted from God to Moses, and through him, to Israel. The Aramaic Sar-Torah ritual in Ma'aseh Merkavah mentions \"the great prince of the Torah, who was with Moses at Mt. Sinai.\"40 Another impor­tant example is the midrashic introduction to a magical book known as Shimmushe Torah, which provides techniques for deriving magical names from the text of the Torah. This tale, which was also published as Ma'ayan Hokhmah, depicts Moses' struggle in heaven to receive the Torah as well as magical techniques derived from it.41 It is worth noting that in Hekhalot Zutarti, Moses is not linked with the narrative Sar-Torah tradition as it 38 Given the Sar-Torah content of this passage, this is the most probable meaning of sgh and not a spiritual or visionary one. Cf. Elior, Hekhalot Zutarti, 61. 39 See Chapter 6. 40 For a full list of references to Moses in Sar-Torah texts see Halperin, Faces of the Char­iot, 425-29.

This idea and its implications are discussed more fully in Chapter 7. The praxis consists only of recitation of the prayer in 1-3 with the divine names in 2. There is no preparatory ritual or ritual of ingestion such as those that appear in other Sar-Torah and petihat lev texts. The petition begins with the formula be-shem, \"in the name of. . . ,\" which opens mag­ical incantations.42 The divine name contains elements, such as MRM'WT and SMWSLM, found in Jewish and Hellenistic magic.43 The petition mentions the major genres of the scholastic curriculum, including halakhic and aggadic traditions. The prayer ends with a blessing from Ps. 119, which also appears in the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah B (§312) and in texts for petihat lev.44 §340: TRANSLATION I. When Moses ascended to God, A. the Holy One, Blessed be He, taught him 1. concerning any man whose heart errs, 2. that he should recite over it these names: B. Awesome, YHWH of Hosts, Ή BHH YH BYH YHW'L, YHW'L, 1. you, these holy names, 2. open my heart; Let all that I hear, be they words of Torah, or any other words in the world, 3. be preserved in my heart and not be forgotten by me forever. Although this version of the passage opens with the same introduction (A) ascribing the instructions to Moses at his ascent, the petition itself (B) is a different one. It contains a different name from that in §336. This detail may be one reason the scribe of MS. NY 8128 included it in the manuscript. This petition also omits the list, typical in Sar-Torah texts, of types of Torah the practitioner wishes to learn. Instead, it mentions, more generally, \"words of Torah, or any other words in the world.\" Unlike the prayer in §336, §340 does not conclude in a liturgical blessing. In addi­tion, the petition contains the formula petihat lev, \"opening the heart,\" bringing it closer to that genre of magical prayers and incantations. HEKHALOTZ UTARTI: CONCLUSIONS These passages are two similar but distinct petitions for memory and re­tention, each preceded by an identical introduction attributing it to God's 42 See Swartz, \"Scribal Magic,\" 172-73. 43 See Scholcm, Jewish Gnosticism, 76 and 134, and Gruenwald, Apocalyptic, 143. 44 See MS.

In this attribution the introduction is similar to passages in Hekhalot and magical literatures. The Sar-Torah himself—the angel appointed over Torah and wisdom— does not figure in this passage. Rather than a praxis for cultivation of the angel, this passage is a magical prayer for increasing learning capacity. The language of petition is fortified with the magical names. This passage thus has more in common with the verbal formulae accompanying rituals for petihat lev than with the Sar-Torah narratives. It was placed into the frame­work of a collection of introductory testimonies at the beginning of Hekhalot Zutarti. SAR-TORAH TRADITIONS IN GENIZAH TEXTS Sar-Torah passages are extant in several fragments from the Cairo Ge-nizah. In most cases the Sar-Torah texts appear with other Hekhalot and magical materials. In at least one case, the fragments known as Hotam ha-Merkavah, Sar-Torah elements are worked into a more encompassing con­tinuous narrative. MS. Leningrad Antonin 186 (=G19) This fragment begins with an otherwise unknown adjuration of Metatron, although it has affinities to several Sar-Torah texts we have seen and is parallel to a passage in the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah, §310. It is found on one leaf, which is dated by M. Beit Arie to the end of the eleventh century.45 The beginning of lines 1-5 are torn off. It is also probable that this text did not begin with this leaf.

ANALYSIS The fragment begins (I) with a list of Divine names, including God's dec­laration at Exod. 3:14, \"I am that I am.\" This phrase, which is quite com­monly used as a magical name in incantation texts,56 is identified in A 1 and C with other divine names. The scriptural context of that verse, in which the name is revealed to Moses at the Burning Bush, is a major theme of this passage. Its premise is that not only did God reveal that phrase and the Tetragrammaton at Horeb, but He revealed the esoteric magical names presented in the text as well. In this, our text resembles the passages from Hekhalot Zutarti analyzed above. However, this idea is more fully developed in this text, whereas in Hekhalot Zutarti the notion is introduced in a brief lemma. The identification of Exod. 3:14 with the other divine names is reinforced in B 1 by the quotation of Exod. 3:15, \"This is my name forever.\" Unit II consists of instructions for reciting the incantation. It is to be accompanied by a regimen of diet and isolation and recited after the daily Shemac. Unit III consists of instructions for the adjuration itself. A con­tains the text of the incantation. It begins (1) with a series of verbs of adjuration common in magical texts,57 addressed repetitively to Metatron 53 Heb. mitqayyem. 54 This clause is in Aramaic. 55 Cf. Exod. 3:15. 56 See Trachtenberg, Jewish Magic, 91. 57 See Swartz, \"Scribal Magic,\" 173-74."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"RITUALS AND RELATED TEXTS 121 and continues (2) by invoking the tradition of the seventy names of Meta-tron. B is a version of a widely distributed set of instructions for reciting the divine or angelic names 111 times.58 C continues a tradition of the names of Metatron also found in other Sar-Torah texts. D and E augment the archangel traditions by identifying Metatron with Zebudiel (D) and with the Youth (E). F concludes the passage with a paraphrase of Exod. 3:15, which serves as a testimony to the divine origins of the name, and the recitation of a doxology which is customarily recited after the pronun­ciation of the Divine name. After this passage, the text continues with another divine name tradition, which it calls \"The Seal of Rabbi Ishmael.\" A magical prayer for an unspecified purpose follows. Although the text as it appears in this fragment does not appear in the manuscripts in the Synopse, it does include several passages known from other Sar-Torah and Hekhalot texts. In particular, the traditions about the names of Metatron and the instructions for counting those names are simi­lar to Version B of the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah.

The two passages place the material in the following sequence: The Genizah fragment thus places the instructions between the first and second set of names. Another parallel is the Sar-Torah text in Merkavah Rabbah. There we find the tradition of the names identified as Metatron's in §682, the Zevudiel passage in §685, and the instructions for counting the names in §681. The counting instructions appear in the context of the Sar-Torah narrative: When I returned and gave the reply to its owner, what did he do? His mouth uttered names and the fingers of his hands counted until he counted 111 times. And so, for anyone who uses this praxis—his mouth must utter names and the fingers of his hands must count until he counts 111 times. He shall not subtract or add to them, and if he has subtracted or added his blood is on his head. The narrative report of Rabbi Akiba's counting ritual thus becomes an instruction to the reader to do the same. Despite the close parallels among these texts, it is clear that no direct dependence of one on the others can be shown. Rather, these traditions— the Metatron, Zevudiel, and counting passages—belong to a common stock of Sar-Torah traditions set differently by each redactor. In our Ge-nizah fragment, the purpose of incorporating them is to provide details for the proper adjuration of Metatron. As we can see from parallels in theme, wording, and pericopae, this passage is evidence that the texts of the Sar-Torah praxis was not confined to the European manuscript tradition reflected in the Synopse. However, there are differences. Neither manuscript tradition is dependent on the other. The adjuration is focused on Metatron exclusively, and the narrative context of Rabbi IshmaePs instructions is lacking.59 §310 G19 (1) First set of names (2) Second set of names (3) Zevudiel (4) Instructions (1) First set of names (4) Instructions (2) Second set of names (3) Zevudiel MS.

These fragments were first published by Gruenwald and then by Schafer.60 They have been dated to the eleventh century.61 MS.

The text works several elements of the Merkavah tradition into a coherent narra­tive: instructions for an ascent to the Hekhalot, Sar-Torah and angelologi­cal traditions, and glorification of a certain Babylonian sage.63 Although the ascent passages in MS. G8 follow the general outline of Hekhalot Rab-bati and may have been inspired by that text, they contain much unusual material. The scribe of G8 has divided the manuscript into sections, perhaps indi­cating separate sources: Hotam ha-Merkavah, \"The Seal of the Merkavah\" (fol. 2b, line 24); Sar-Torah dilah, \"its Sar-Torah [text]\"(ibid.);64 and 'Ad kan Gevurat 'Anafiel, \"thus far the might of Anafiel\" (fol. 2b, line 49). Sar-Torah dilah is a brief passage in which Rabbi Ishmael describes the testifies to the effectiveness of a list of angelic names; and Gevurat Anafiel, which may be have been considered by the scribe to have been part of the Sar-Torah section, is a description of an archangel roughly parallel to §420 in Hekhalot Zutarti.65 In the following, some themes of the ascent section 60 Gruenwald, Qeta'im; Schafer, Geniza-Fragmente, 97-111, 183-89.

On these fragments see Gruenwald, Apocalyptic, 188-90, Halperin, Faces of the Chariot, 368-70, Martha Himmelfarb, \"Heavenly Ascent and the Relationship of the Apocalypses and the Hekhalot Literature,\" HTJCA 59 (1988): 73-100, and Elliot Wolfson, iiYeridah.'\" 64 On the meaning of this title see below. 65 See Gruenwald, Qeta'im, 366, and Schafer, Geniza-Fragmente, 111.

Ozhaya teaches him to avoid the dangers of the journey and in the course of his instructions divulges further angelological and eschatological secrets. These secrets in­clude the revelation of the name of a sage who will appear in the future in the \"house of the master\" (bet hn-Rav) in Babylonia. The bulk of the text concerns the path (netiv) that the traveler is to follow and the seal (hotam) that he is to use. The ascent of the practitioner will result in his enthrone­ment in the divine chamber.67 The instructions are not only spoken by the angel for the traveler's un­derstanding, but are written as well. Following the apocalyptic excursus, the angel continues: But I have interrupted you, and you were writing. Here is the seal of the descent to the Merkavah for the inhabitants of the world, for you and for anyone who wishes to descend and to gaze at the King and his beauty. Now take this path, and descend, and see, and you will not be harmed. For I have placed it on a scroll for you and seen it. And afterwards you descended and tested, and you were not harmed.

Immediately the world was saved.\"72 It is difficult to tell what the author means by the statement that \"the world was saved\" (mi-yad nig'al ha-'olam). It is doubtful that the phrase refers to messianic redemption of the world or an inner state of salvation. Rather, it may mean that the world (the earth or the divine world) was saved from destruction by proper use of the procedure. In Hekhalot Zu-tarti, §424 instructs the practitioner on the proper way to recite the fore­going traditions: \"If he is reciting it for his fellow,73 he should pronounce one letter from the beginning and one from the end and not join them together, lest he err and destroy the world of the Holy One, blessed be He.\"74 Here improper use of the tradition might cause the destruction of the divine world. The phrase may also refer to the idea that the earth is sustained from one generation to another by virtue of the use of a particu­lar ritual procedure or cosmic event. According to m. Avot 6:6 (Pereq Qinyan Torah), anyone who cites a saying in a teacher's name \"brings redemption [jje'ulah] to the world.\"75 In this testimony the effectiveness of the praxis is proven by its use by the weakest student of the academy. This passage is strongly reminiscent of Sar-Torah narratives we have seen in which the Sar-Torah procedure is tried by a junior colleague, who becomes a great sage.76 Thus, although the extant portions of this section do not mention the Sar-Torah, they do contain themes that shed light on our Sar-Torah texts. \"SAR-TORAH DILAH\" The Sar-Torah section of MS.

VIII. Thus far the \"might of Anafiel.\" IX. Rabbi Ishmael said: I adjure you QBRQLY'L the Prince— Analysis. The text begins with a first-person narration by an angel. He begins by describing and listing a series of twelve divine names, corre­sponding to the twelve tribes of Israel 92 Following this list is a hymn (II) describing the angels' awestruck praise of God. This hymn is also found at §306, appended to a Sar-Torah text in Hekhalot Rabbati,93 and appears as well in a collection of ascent hymns in Hekhalot Rabbati at §153. This parallel is further indication of the influence of the HekhalotRabbati tradi­tion on the author. At this point (III), the angelic narrator identifies his role in the adjuration and ascent: he is the one who punishes an angel who dares to disobey the adjurer.94 At IV, Rabbi Ishmael is the speaker. He testifies that he and his col­leagues wrote down the names of these angels. This passage is additional evidence that the author of these fragments is conscious of the textuality of the angelic and ritual traditions he is imparting. Rabbi Ishmael continues at IV with a testimony to the success of the angelic names in securing skill in learning. In this testimony, as in similar Sar-Torah passages, he enumer­ates the elements of the rabbinic curriculum that he was able to master in V. These include scriptures and midrashic and oral halakhic traditions. At VI, the text continues with a description of an angel who is appointed over the gate of the divine throneroom and his encounter with Rabbi Ishmael. This passage, which is also found at Hekhalot Zutarti §420, would seem to be resuming the archangel's discourse begun at I. How-90 Here the text has wrbbw, which is difficult. Since the following word, wswhbw, is similar, it is possible that this word is an error that is corrected in the next word. 91 This (with its parallel in §420) and the mention of virgins in the next line are rare attestations in Hekhalot literature to the idea that women can encounter these angels. 92 On this idea, see Gruenwald, Tiqqunim, 216. 93 See Chapter 4 above. 94 The idea that angels may need to be threatened with punishment for disobedience is reflected in adjuration texts. See, for example, §636 in the Sar-ha-Panim incantation in which the adjurer threatens the angel with punishment if he delays; on this idea see the discussion of this text below. Cf. also the hymn in 2 above (parallel to §153) in which angels who do not sing in unison are punished."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"130 CHAPTER 5 ever, as it has apparently been grafted to this text from an outside source, it is not immediately related to the previous. Unit VII is a testimony by Anafiel and is probably the unit designated by the subscription gevurat cAnafiel, \"the might of Anafiel,\" in VIII. There Anafiel warns of the conse­quences of adjuring him by the wrong names. Anafiel is known elsewhere as a principal gatekeeper95 and shares several characteristics of archangel figures.96 This warning is reminiscent of testimonies appended to several texts warning of the dire punishments awaiting anyone who misuses the tradition.97 The last line of the fragment contains the beginning of the next passage (IX), an adjuration of an angel, the rest of which is not extant. MS. G8: CONCLUSIONS This entire fragment (Hotam ha-Merkavah and its Sar-Torah appendixes) is patterned after the structure and language of Hekhalot Rabbati. The author has not simply appropriated passages from that work—indeed, it is difficult to tell whether he had Hekhalot Rabbati as we have it before him or in some other form.98 Nonetheless, the overall structure of this text is strongly reminiscent of that work. It weaves apocalyptic concerns with the descent to the Merkavah as does Hekhalot Rabbati, it places major dangers at the sixth and seventh Hekhalot, and it concludes with testimonies re­garding the effectiveness of the praxis. It also follows the ascent material with a Sar-Torah text. The author, however, has his own concerns, such as his eschatological interest in the Babylonian leader mentioned in the text and the emphasis that the effective agent of ascent is a single seal written in the beginning of the book. The author seems to be carrying out literary activity in a tradition in which the Hekhalot-Rabbati tradition exists as a composite, which in­cludes hymns,99 magical seals, the descent to the Merkavah, and the Sar-Torah praxis. Unlike the editors of many of the principal extant Hekhalot texts, our author has woven these elements into a coherent narrative. He even makes an effort to mend the seams in the text by use of dialogue (\"for I have interrupted you\"). The text thus attests to a stage in the evolution of the Sar-Torah and Merkavah traditions in which various elements are further integrated. 95 Cf. his role in the ascent narrative of Hekhalot Rabbati. 96 See Gruenwald, Apocalyptic, 167-68 and 202-3. 97 Cf. §424, discussed above and in Chapter 6; and §500 (§854). 98 See Schafer, \"Tradition and Redaction,\" 13; on the redactional nature of Hekhalot Rabbati see Schafer, \"Zur Problem der redaktionellen Identitat von Hekhalot Rabbati.'\" 99 Cf. the text's mention in fol. 2b, line 20, of the \"songs and specifications\" of the ascent\" (shirav u-ferushav), echoing the opening of HekhalotRabbati: \"What is the specifica­tion of the songs?\" (Mah hefresh shirot)."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"RITUALS AND RELATED TEXTS 131 MS. G22: A FRAGMENTARY GENIZAH SAR-TORAH TEXT This fragment belongs to the same codex as MS. G8 and was published by Gruenwald together with it.100 From the colophon at the end of fol. Ib it is evident that the manuscript concluded there. The left-hand edge of the fragment is broken, thus the ends of the lines are lacking. The text is quite incomplete and, like MS. G8, contains several unusual details and presents serious difficulties. Although the text is too fragmentary to translate and analyze in full here, several significant features will be noted. The text, like G8, is particularly concerned with a distinct angelology, featuring unusual archangel figures such as Tanrael and Ozhaya.101 Sar-Torah elements are worked into this general angelology. This text also shows evidence of influence from the Hekhalot Rabbati tradition. It con­tains several hymns found in Hekhalot Rabbati and uses some of the same terminology. At the beginning of the fragment, the text mentions a name forbidden even to King David.102 The text continues with praise of God and lists of divine names. At line 18, a particular angel is discussed: 18 ... Rabbi Ishm[ael ] said: [ . . . there are times when he is called] 19 QRBS'L and there are times when he is called QRBSB'L who is near to SGSGt'L ] 20 QRBS'L who is SGSG'L, the Prince of Talmud, who casts before TWTRYSY, [ ] 21 the King of the world, who spoke and the world came into being, whose names are more numerous than oth[ers' ]103 Unfortunately, the object of the verb mashlikh (\"casts\") is missing.104 The designation the Prince of Study (Sar-Talmud) does not appear elsewhere in published Hekhalot texts. At this point the text inserts hymnic passages parallel to hymns in Hekhalot Rabbati and description of the Merkavah. Line 33 is parallel to §94, a well-known hymn in Hekhalot Rabbati, in which the throne is ex-100 Gruenwald, Qeta'im, 368-70; Schafer, Geniza-Tragmente, 186-89.

Translations are displayed according to the line numbers in Schafer's edition. 101 See, for example, fol. la, line 29. 102 According to Gruenwald (Qeta'im, 368) this line implies that David was also among the Yorde Merkavah. However, as Schafer points out (Geniza-Fragmmte, 188), the passage only says that David was not allowed to recite a particular name. 103 Gruenwald's reading. 104 In the Aramaic Sar-Torah text in Ma'aseh Merkavah (§577) the angels are adjured to \"cast into me [hashlikhu bi] scriptures, Mishnah and Talmud.\" However, here the text is speaking of casting something or someone before God."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"132 CHAPTER 5 horted to praise God.105 The difference between the two, however, is noteworthy. Whereas in Hekhalot Rabbati the hymn culminates in the Qedushah, the hymn concludes in our fragment with a description of Ozhaya's role in the Sar-Torah praxis: 36 that Ozhaya the Angel106 of the Presence gives to anyone who adjures by the names [of the angels107 ] 37 SQDHWZYY and MRGYW'L and HDRWYLYY, for they are indeed the princes of the Torah. Ozhaya is also the principal interlocutor and the Sar-ha-Panim in the Hotam ha-Merkavah text. The other angelic names mentioned here are associated elsewhere in Hekhalot literature with the Sar ha-Panim.108 At fol 2b, the text turns more fully to Sar-Torah matters. The first lines apparendy describe a revelation from the divine throne to the speaker. A testimony appears at line 7: 7 Rabbi Ishmael said: It came out in the likeness of a hand109 and gave me at [once110 ] 8 [a se]al and a ring in his right hand and said to me: See, the latter ones, a seal of a ri[ng ] 9 the upright ones, for according to them anyone who enters may enter and anyone who goes out may go out, and according to t[hem ] 10 [and a]ccording to them anyone who becomes wise may become wise and anyone who becomes enlightened may become enlightened and ac­cording to them anyone who is humbled is [humbled, and according to them anyone who ] 11 anyone who increases] the paths of Torah,111 testimony, and acumen, for they are masters of Mishnah, masters of talmud, masters of \"exten­sion\";112 and they are the very princes of prophecy of my throne of glory. 105 On this hymn and its affinities to the \"song of the kine\" attested in rabbinic literature, see Scholem, Gnosticism, 24-26. 106 Reading Mal'akh for Melekh with Gruenwald.

G8. Lines 9-11 speak of powerful figures known as masters of Mishnah, (ba'ale Mishnah), masters of Talmud, and so on. These are prob­ably angels who designate who is to receive the powers bestowed on the Sar-Torah practitioners.114 Not only do they decide who is to enter and exit the divine realm, but who is to be great or humble in learning, and, perhaps, in social position. In enumerating the facets of Torah under their authority, the text lists elements of rabbinic learning, much as the rabbinic curriculum is described in other Sar-Torah testimonies. Included, how­ever, are rabbinical hermeneutical techniques (such as ribbui, \"exten­sion,\") and prophecy. The next several lines are very difficult, but seem to assure the practitioner that he will acquire the capacity to absorb \"myriads of teachings [. . .] and gaze at them every day, miraculously,115 [and] to sustain what you hear from my Hiouth.\"116 At fol. lb, line 26, instructions appear for the Sar-Torah ritual: 26 ...

The requirement to wear new woolen clothes is somewhat different from other rituals, which often re­quire white or colorless garments.118 The text concludes at line 29 with the subscription, \"[ ] Seven Great and Small Hekhalot.\" This is evidently the title of the compilation— perhaps, the entire Hekhalot compilation under study here, which in­cluded the \"Seal of the Merkavah\" text.

Sar-Torah Traditions in Genizah Texts: Conclusions The Sar-Torah traditions in Genizah texts allow us to see the development of the genre outside of the Hekhalot corpus as transmitted through Haside-Ashkenazic manuscripts. These display several important differ­ences from the texts surveyed in the previous chapter. MS. G19 is an in­cantation directed at Metatron, and lacks the narrative context of the major Sar-Torah texts in the European manuscripts of Hekhalot literature. MSS. G8 and G22, however, are framed by narrative in a particularly strik­ing way; they seem to reflect a tradition by which secrets of ascent and the Sar-Torah are said to be revealed in an angelic monologue which is then transcribed by the author. The major concerns are angelology and soteri-ology. Angels and their complex relationships are described in detail here, and, in the Hotam ha-Merkavah text, related to an earthly rabbi. Although the Sar-Torah ritual itself is described briefly, it is does not take up the preponderance of the text—even in the Sar-Torah section. It is part of a larger discourse on the angels and the mysteries they can impart. We have seen in the previous chapter that the functions of ascent and Sar-Torah ritual were discrete and were combined when redactors included them together in their compilations. The Genizah fragments may be evidence of a stage in the tradition's development in which they were integrated more thoroughly. The fragments also provide an interesting clue as to their origin. The mention of the Master in Babylonia (Rav 'ehad be-Vavel) is evidence for a Babylonian provenance of the text. Furthermore, the peculiar nature of the fragments and the commonality of themes and angelic figures through­out are evidence that they were written by an individual or small circle of disciples. It has been argued here that this author or circle knew several aspects of the Hekhalot tradition and that much of that tradition devel­oped in late-talmudic or post-talmudic Babylonia. Therefore, we can place the author or authors of the Hotam ha-Merkavah complex in Geonic Bab­ylonia, close to the eleventh-century date at which our manuscript was written down. These fragments are highly original, and describe figures and concerns 120 see Schafer, Geniza-Fragmente, 189. 121 Gruenwald reads \"Joseph\" here. Schafer, however, does not see this reading as justified."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"RITUALS AND RELATED TEXTS 135 not found in other Sar-Torah texts. Nonetheless, there are also important continuities. There are many passages shared between the Genizah and European manuscripts; hymns found in Hekhalot Rabbati are prominent among these. Furthermore, the structure of Hekhalot Rabbati, in its more developed recensions,122 is echoed in this complex. The ascent culminates in the seventh Hekhal; the angel Anafiel plays an important part in the initiation of the traveler; the human being is seated in the divine throne-room; and the ascent is followed by the imparting of information about the Sar-Torah. It is plausible that the author of these fragments was ac­quainted with some form of the Hekhalot Rabbati tradition and worked its elements into an approach that stressed the angelic revelation of secrets, including those of ascent, eschatology, and the acquisition of Torah. SAR HA-PANIM TEXTS The Sar ha-Panim, the Prince of the Presence, often figures in narrative Sar-Torah texts. In some the Sar ha-Panim instructs Rabbi Ishmael in the proper procedure; in some he is the chief angel. For example, Metatron is designated as the Sar ha-Panim in 3 Enoch. In Ma'aseh Merkavah he is apparently the supervisor of \"angels of mercy\" and reveals the name of the Sar-Torah. In fact, the Sar ha-Panim, unlike the Sar-Torah, is known in sources outside of Hekhalot literature. In the book of Jubilees, an Angel of the Presence acts as the intermediary between Moses and God acting as the agent by whom the history of creation and Israel is written. In the Apocalypse of the Ten Martyrs, which is closely related to Hekhalot litera­ture, Metatron is the Sar ha-Panim, who engages in a dialogue with Rabbi Ishmael.123 The passages translated and analyzed below are ritual texts for conjura­tion of the Sar ha-Panim that do not mention the Sar-Torah. Nonetheless, they are relevant to the Sar-Torah phenomenon. Like the Sar-Torah texts, the Sar ha-Panim texts concern the cultivation of an angel who comes down to earth. In addition, Sar ha-Panim rituals are sometimes performed for the purpose of gaining esoteric wisdom. §§623-639: The Sar ha-Panim Incantation The principal ritual Sar ha-Panim text is the Sar ha-Panim incantation found in Merkavah Rabbah §§623-39. It appears in four closely related 122 On these see Peter Schafer, \"Hekhalot Rabbati.\" 123 Reeg, Die Geschichte von den zehn Martyren, chap. 15. In Hekhalot Rabbatfs recen­sion of the apocalypse of the Ten Martyrs at §108, the Sar ha-Panim informs Rabbi Nehuniah of God's plans."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"136 CHAPTER 5 manuscripts: MSS.

In the New York and Oxford manuscripts it follows a version of the magical text Harba} de-Moshe, the \"Sword of Moses\" (§§598-622).124 In the other two manuscripts it follows Ma'aseh Merkavah. In an article first published before the Synopse, Peter Schafer edited and translated this text and anno­tated it in depth.125 This analysis will therefore focus on several aspects of the text relevant to this study. The Sar ha-Panim incantation is relevant to this study both for its affini­ties to the Sar-Torah texts and its differences from them. Like Sar-Torah narratives, this text is attributed to Rabbi Akiba in the name of Rabbi Eliezer the Great.126 Although, as Schafer observes,127 the text does not mention the Torah explicitly, it does list categories of wisdom and claim that the Sar ha-Panim will grant to humanity \"the secrets of above and below.\" The incantation is to be preceded by an unusual ritual, which combines a regimen of abstention with a special immersion. The following translation is based on Schafer's linear edition of §§623-39, and relies primarily on MS. Oxf. 1531.128 TRANSLATION I. (§623) Rabbi Akiba asked Rabbi Eliezer the Great: A. How is the Prince of the Presence adjured to descend to earth and to reveal to humanity the secrets of above and below and the pro­fundity129 of the foundations of below and the enigmas of wis­dom and the skills of perspicacity?130 1.

ANALYSIS The Sar ha-Panim incantation is a striking demonstration that rituals in Hekhalot literature have as their goal the conjuration of an angel to come to the practitioner on earth. This text is quite explicit about the mechanics of that process. Unlike some of the Sar-Torah rituals, this text leaves no doubt that the conjuration of the angel is not to take place in the context of an ascent to heaven. The warning given by Rabbi Eliezer in response to Rabbi Ishmael's question (I A 1) is a case in point. The Sar ha-Panim is particularly fearsome and occupies an prominent position among the heav­enly hosts. Therefore, when Rabbi Eliezer once tried to conjure him, \"he tried to destroy the entire world.\"169 Similarly, in the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah stories and in Ma'aseh Merkavah the angel rebukes Rabbi Ish-mael for \"disturbing the heavenly household,\" by compelling him to de­scend.170 Rabbi Eliezer's warning thus accentuates the extraordinary nature of the act of bringing one of the principals of the heavenly retinue to the human realm. Although in Jewish angelology there are certainly angels who perform their missions on earth, there are, in some concep­tions, those of a different class who serve in heaven.171 The purpose of conjuring the Sar ha-Panim is stated in I A: it is so that he will \"reveal to humanity the secrets of above and below and the profun­dity of the foundations of below and the enigmas of wisdom and the skills of perspicacity.\" Like Sar-Torah rituals, the Sar ha-Panim incantation will result in the individual's extraordinary knowledge and intelligence. Unlike the testimonies to those rituals, however, this passage mentions neither the specific skills of memory and retention required for Torah study nor the 167 The following is in Aramaic. 168 Reading Awyn for rywwn with Schafer, \"Beschworung,\" 136 n. 134. 169 There is no evidence that the \"world\" mentioned here is considered by the author to be the internal world of the mystic; cf. Gruenwald, Apocalyptic, 174. Rather, it is the result of the volatility of the divine beings, who react when the proper conditions for their descent are met. On this idea, see Chapter 6 below. 170 In Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah B the angel is the Sar-Torah; in Ma'aseh Merkavah it is the Sar ha-Panim. 171 Cf. Braita de-Ma'aseb Bereshit §181, which makes a distinction between those angels that do work on earth and those that serve and praise God in heaven. On this text see Chapter 6 below."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"RITUALS AND RELATED TEXTS 143 genres of Torah, such as Mishnah or Talmud, that the practitioner will be able to master. It is apparent that the angel confers cosmological and eso­teric secrets. But he is also said to grant the practitioner ta'alumot hokh-mah ve-'ormat toshiah. In biblical Hebrew, these terms denote practical human traits, more in the realm of cunning and acumen than sacred knowledge. However, it is difficult to tell what these terms meant to the author of this text. cOrmnh usually means cunning or prudence,172 but the terms ta'alumah and toshiah are not common in rabbinic literature. A source that may illuminate these terms is the medieval Italian Chroni­cle of Ahimaaz written in the eleventh century. In it, the author praises the wisdom and erudition of the sons of his ancestor Rabbi Amitai: He had fine and learned sons, wise, and intelligent, experts and poets,173 teachers, who instructed diligent students, princes, leaders, who understood secrets [mevine sodim\\, composers of rhymes, knowers of mysteries [yod'e mzim], examining wisdom, investigating into understanding, and inspecting 'ormah, and enlightened in the Sefer ha-Tasbar, and looking into the secret of the Merkavah. The first was R. Shefatiah, who engaged in toshiah.174 Ahimaaz, who wrote in a poetic prose style, wished to incorporate as many literary terms for Torah and wisdom as possible. In addition, he, like the author of the \"mystical curriculum\" in Midrash Mishle and others, included mystical and esoteric subjects along with poetry and traditional learning in his conception of the types of wisdom. The esoteric subjects he mentions include a book entitled Sefer ha-Tashar—probably a magical book175—and the vision of the Merkavah. In the same way, the author of our Sar ha- Panim text mined the biblical lexicon for terms for wisdom, and saw them as encompassing the halakhic, the esoteric, and the practical. To be sure, these types of wisdom are not unrelated. In wisdom literature in particular, exemplified by the biblical Proverbs and Avot in the rabbinic tradition, practical advice goes hand in hand with exhortations to study Torah. The introduction's statement of the purpose of the ritual is borne out by the text of the incantation itself. In E 5 the practitioner is to call upon the angel to descend and fulfill his main request: \"And when you descend, do not drive me insane, but reveal to me all the profundities of the mysteries of above and below and the secrets of the hidden places of above and the 172 Jastrow, Dictionary, 1120. 173 That is, liturgical poets (payetanim). 174 Benjamin Klar, Mejjillat 'Ahimaas, 2nd ed. (Jerusalem: Tarshish, 1973), p. 12, lines 12-16. For an English translation see Marcus Salzman, The Chronicle of Ahimaaz (1924; reprint, New York: AMS Press, 1966). 175 A magical book of that name is listed in Hai Gaon's responsum on mysticism and magic: see B. Lewin, Osar ha-Geonim Hagigah, 20."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"144 CHAPTER 5 mysteries of understanding and the skills of perspicacity, like a man who is speaking to his fellow.\" The phrase, \"mysteries of understanding and the skills of perspicacity,\" is used in the introduction to the praxis. The Sar ha-Panim is thus to speak to the practitioner face-to-face and tell him the mysteries without affecting his sanity.176 The function of the Sar ha-Panim in this text can be compared with his role in Section II of Ma'aseh Merkavah. There he has two functions rele­vant to the praxis: he serves as the liaison between the human practitioner and the Divine bureaucracy; and he is the supervisor of the Sar-Torah, who is the guardian of the secrets of Torah. In Ma'aseh Merkavah, the Sar ha-Panim (there called PRQDM),177 after rebuking Rabbi Ishmael, finally brought down \"angels of mercy, [who] caused understanding to dwell in [his] heart.\" In both cases, the Sar ha-Panim is the agent of the practi­tioner's wisdom. However, the Sar-Torah does not figure in this incanta­tion. Rather, the Sar ha-Panim is to grant wisdom directly to the adept. The adjuration is quite specific on this point: \"[§634] By them I adjure you and command and ordain you, to hurry and descend to me, I, N son of N: you and not your messenger.\" Another significant difference is in the ritual process itself. As in Sar-Torah rituals we have seen, the practitioner to purify himself by fasting, refraining from anointing, and washing himself of seminal pollution. Al­though other ritual texts in the Sar-Torah corpus prescribe ablution, none make the ablution a central aspect of the ritual as this ritual does. He is then to bathe in water up to his neck before adjuring the angel. It is not clear whether his adjuration is simply a precondition for the adjuration, or the adjuration is actually to be performed during while he is bathing. As we shall see in Chapter 6, this ritual follows an ancient pattern in which rivers were liminal points for encounters with the divine beings. The plea that the practitioner is to make before the adjuration (Cl) makes it clear that the angel's ferocity is motivated by his intolerance of impurity: \"I adjure you, princes of dread, fear, and trembling, who are designated to injure anyone who is not clean and pure, and proceed to employ the ser­vants of the Most High.\" The adjuration can now begin because, as stated in D, \"he has sealed himself with the forty-two-letter name.\" The ritual procedure has two main stages: The ritual preparation, in­cluding the ritual of immersion that accompanies the adjuration (B); and the adjuration itself (C-F). B is a regimen of preparation in which the practitioner fasts and rids himself of ritual purity. He is to perform purifica­tory ablutions for seven days (2) and to fast (1) and immerse up to his neck 176 This latter detail is unusual. The author's concern that the practitioner's mental state will be affected by the angel is also reflected in the command in D 3 that the angel not frighten him. Cf. n. 178 below. 177 The spelling of this name varies. See Swartz, Mystical Prayer, 84."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"RITUALS AND RELATED TEXTS 145 (3) on the final of day of the ritual. C is a preliminary adjuration to the hostile angels not to harm the practitioner. This is referred to in D as \"sealfing] himself with the forty-two-letter name, which the heavenly hosts will hear and dread and fear and tremble.\" The adjuration continues to the end of the passage in D-F. D contains another plea for protection; in this case, it is an appeal against the practitioner's fear and failure of nerve.178 E and F are additional units, added to the previous material by the word shuv, \"again.\"179 E is an adjuration by \"fourteen names,\" which are evi­dently used by prophets to learn their secrets. As Schafer points out, the idea of fourteen names is not known to us from another source.180 How­ever, fourteen is twice seven, and seven seals are listed in similar fashion in Section II of Ma'aseh Merkavah. The fourteen names are listed in 1 a. Each consists of the name proper, which is spelled out in full (meforash, here translated \"specification\") and an alternative name (kinnuy, translated as \"substitute.)\" The term kinnuy serves in rabbinic literature to desig­nate pious circumlocutions for the Tetragrammaton.181 The first of these names is ruah pisqonit, an enigmatic name that figures in rabbinic tradition as an angel who defends Israel before God and as a name for Metatron in the ShicUr Qomah and other names concerning the multiple names of the archangel.182 In 3, four of the names are said to be engraved on the heads of the holy Hayyot. Here the Merkavah exegesis serves to fortify the magical process of the incantation and not the other way around. Certainly no vision of the Merkavah is involved here. The names are powerful because they are en-178 Although Hekhalot narratives frequently describe the dread that accompanies the en­counter with the angels, that idea does not often find its way into the text of an incantation. However, incantations against fear and trembling appear in magical amulets and handbooks. In some cases, such as MS. TS Kl.18/30, an amulet for childbirth, adjurations for protec­tion from fear are incorporated into incantations for other purposes; see Schiffman and Swartz, Incantation Texts; 77-78. Cf. also MS. TS K1.94, for headache (Schiffman and Swartz, p. 99). 179 This is a literary device linking discrete sources and does not mean that the rest of the incantation is to be recited if the previous one has not been effective. See Schiffman and Swartz, Incantation Texts, 79; cf. Gruenwald, Apocalyptic, 176. 180 Schafer, \"Beschworung,\" 127 n. 40. 181 J. Z. Lauterbach, \"Substitutes for the Tetragrammaton,\" PAAJR (1930-31): 39-67.

See Cohen, The Shi'ur Qomah, 128-30. As Schafer, \"Beschworung,\" 128 n. 44, points out, the fifth specified name in the series, SNYGRWN, is apparently derived from the word senejforin, \"legal advocate,\" a appellation also given to the archangel Michael. On the term see D.

Having protected himself, first with the forty-two-letter name and then with the fourteen names, the magician enters his petition in 4-5 that the angel descend directly to him (\"you and not your messenger\") and reveal secrets to him. The adjuration is reinforced in 6, where the importance and miraculous qualities of the names he has uttered is attested. F constitutes a new unit of the adjuration, this time employing \"five names.\" F 5 consists of a threat to the angels: If they do not obey the magician they will be pushed into the river of fire known as Rigayon.183 Although threats are not often discussed in accounts of prayer and incanta­tion,184 they do appear in Jewish magic. For example, in a Genizah amu­let, TS Kl .18/30, the angels are threatened that if they delay, they will be beaten with the iron rods of the matriarchs.185 The bellicosity of the magi­cian and his angelic allies also figures prominently in the Babylonian magic bowls.186 G introduces further names and archangel traditions. H is an adjuration for compelling the angel to return to heaven after meeting with the practitioner. At I, an Aramaic exorcism, apparently of different provenance, seems to have been appended to the incantation. Its purpose is to warn spirits away during the departure of the angel. The conception of the redactor seems to be that the practitioner is particularly vulnerable during those liminal stages when the angel descends to him and departs from him. He is thus in need of adjurations of protection before he brings him down (C) and when he sends him back up (I). This incantation includes a motif found in many magical texts—that of the powerful name that has the power to command the forces of nature.187 SUMMARY The Sar ha-Panim incantation provides a complete ritual for gaining pro­phetic wisdom—a wisdom not explicitly linked to Torah. The function of the Sar ha-Panim, as in Ma'aseh Merkavah and 3 Enoch, is to inform the practitioner of the secrets of heaven. However, he does so in this ritual as a result of the magician's adjuration. Although this text has several themes in common other Hekhalot and 183 On the Rigayon, see Gruenwald, Apocalyptic, 176, and Schafer, \"Beschworung,\" 133, n. 91. 184 See Peter Metcalf, Where Are Tou, Spirits: Style and Theme in Berawan Prayer (Wash­ington: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1989), 11. 185 Schiffman and Swartz, Incantation Texts, 73.

The expressions mashbia' 'ani ca.kkha, \"I adjure you,\" and gozer 'ani 'alekha, \"I command you,\" are standard adjuration formulae of amulet texts in both Palestinian and Baby­lonian magical traditions.188 The use of the form ploni benploni, \"N. son of N.,\" is typical of magical handbooks. Moreover, there are several rhe­torical devices and motifs, such as the threat to the angels, found in magi­cal texts. This use of conventional magical formulae has implications for the meaning of the incantation. In this ritual, the angel is adjured direcdy by means of the language of magical power. In Jewish magical incantation formulae, the practitioner commands the angel by the divine authority vested in the magical names. Those names, like the seal of the king author­izing an individual to carry out his instructions, prove to a hostile angel that the human being who commands him is not an impertinent invader, but someone to be respected and obeyed.189 §501 (542): An Aramaic Sar ha-Panim Incantation This brief passage is an incantation ritual for bringing the angel Azriel to earth. It is one of several miscellaneous magical texts that appear between Hekhalot Zutarti and Ma 'aseh Merkavah in the principal manuscripts of the Synopse. In MSS. NY 8128 and Oxf. 1531 it follows a short passage on the twenty-two-letter name at §501; in MS. M22 it follows the cosmologi-cal text Seder Rabbah de-Bereshit and an incantation unique in the Hekha-Iot corpus that is apparently for protection from sorcery and theft. In MS. NY 8128 it precedes a ritual for reciting passages from Psalms (§502) and in MSS. Oxf. 1531 at §512 it precedes a brief passage on the divine name (shem ha-meforash). The text is largely in Aramaic. A shorter version of this paragraph also appears in the Genizah fragment TS K21.95.S without the accompanying ritual instructions.190 TRANSLATION I. Petition:191 A.

ANALYSIS This text states no purpose for the incantation beyond that of adjuring the Sar ha-Panim to send the angel Azriel. Nor does the incantation contain a petition for wisdom. The word, 's'yl, \"I petition,\" which begins the pas­sage in MSS. NY 8128 and Oxf. 1531, may refer to the request for the descent of the angel, or it may indicate that the angel is to be conjured so that he may fulfill other requests of the adjurer. However, the structure of the ritual is the same as that of the longer Sar ha-Panim incantation an­alyzed above. At A1-2, the practitioner adjures the Sar ha-Panim to bring the angel down, as in §634. There is also a fasting ritual at B that accom­panies the incantation. Like the Sar ha-Panim, the angel will speak to the practitioner \"face to face.\" Moreover, C, like §639, is an adjuration to bid the angel to return to heaven without harming the human practitioner. There is no evidence that one of these texts is dependent on the other. Rather, the similarities attest to a common pattern and conception of the conjuration of the angel reflected in both. CONCLUSIONS The previous chapter presented the complexes of interlocking narrative traditions that constitute the major Sar-Torah texts. The texts presented here encompass a greater variety of forms and themes. They attest to the extent to which Sar-Torah concerns affected other aspects of the Hekhalot and magical traditions. In Sar-Torah ritual texts and Sar ha-Panim incanta­tions we see the tradition presented largely without narrative. In this, they resemble other magical and incantatory texts, which simply give instruc­tions directly to the reader without couching them in testimony or myth. 192 Heb. meforash."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"RITUALS AND RELATED TEXTS 149 In the Hotam ha-Merkavah fragments, we see the opposite effect: ritual aspects of the Sar-Torah phenomenon are subsumed in a story of ascent, revelation, and divine persona. With this variety, however, there are commonalities. Sar-Torah and re­lated texts all reflect the conviction that human beings can acquire wis­dom and skill in learning Torah through attraction of an angel, who is the guardian of cosmic and scholastic knowledge. In this way ordinary Jews can become like great rabbis. This attraction takes place through a ritual process that involves self-denial and the correct pronouncement of magical names and formulae.

Both the narrative texts, such as the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah and the Ar­amaic Sar-Torah text in Ma caseh Merkavah, have as their purpose the presentation and recommendation of a ritual for skill in Torah. In the preceding analysis, the place of these rituals in the narrative and redac-tional framework has been described. This chapter is an inquiry into the meaning and function of these rituals. RITUAL AND VISION It has been common to consider the rituals of fasting, ablution, and seclu­sion in Hekhalot literature as specifically designed for achieving the state of ecstasy usually associated with the ascent to the divine throne depicted in Hekhalot literature. Scholem states, \"This mystical ascent is always pre­ceded by ascetic practices.\"1 For Ithamar Gruenwald, dietary prohibitions are to be explained chiefly in terms of their effect of the physical strength and consciousness of the mystic.2 Likewise, he describes the effect of the menstruant on the mystic as \"distracting.\"3 Recendy, however, this view has been called into question.4 The first clear evidence for the notion that ritual preparation is necessary for the vision of the heavens is found in a responsum by the eleventh-century Babylonian rabbinic leader Hai Gaon. This discussion has been very influential in setting the tone for how this literature has been stud­ied.5 In this responsum, Hai describes the Hekhalot literature as he under­stands it: Perhaps you know that many of the sages believed that whoever is worthy, [possessing] several [moral] attributes which are mentioned and specified, when he wants to see the Merkavah and glimpse the Hekhalot of the angels on high, there are ways of doing so. He is to sit in fasting a certain number of 1 Scholem, Major Trends, 49. 2 See for example Gruenwald, \"Manichaeism and Judaism,\" 269 n. 37. 3 Gruenwald, \"Manichaeism and Judaism,\" 268 n. 33. 4 See David J. Halperin, \"A New Edition of Hekhalot Literature,\" JAOS 104 (1984): 550.

And so you can glimpse inside it and its chambers as one who sees with his eyes the seven Hekhalot and sees as if he is entering from one Hekhal to another, and sees what is in it.7 David Halperin has shown that Hai Gaon's account of the phenomenon can be traced to an extant written source, a passage in what has come to be known as HekhalotZutarti.8 Furthermore, according to Halperin, Hai has misunderstood that passage. The text reads: Rabbi Akiba said: Whoever wishes to repeat this mishnah and to pronounce the name in its full elaboration,9 must sit fasting for forty days and rest his head between his knees until his fast gets hold of him. Then he must whisper to the ground and not to heaven, so that the earth will hear and not heaven. If he is married, he must be prepared,10 for three days, as it is written: \"Be prepared; do not go near a woman\" [Exod. 19:15]. . . . He should do this regularly every month and every year for thirty days before the New Year from the first of Elul to the Day of Atonement so that no satan or evil plague will attack him all year. Here the fast is undertaken in preparation for the recitation of the pow­erful divine name. The reason the practitioner is to rest his head between one's knees is so that he can avoid fainting and \"so that the earth will hear,\" and not so that he will obtain a vision.11 As Halperin observes, \"It is hard to imagine how any of this could fit in with the heavenly ascensions. But, as a forty-day ritual designed to insure a favorable decision on the day of judgment, it makes some sense.\"12 It is useful to look at this passage in context to see how such a misunderstanding may have come about. Hekhalot Zutarti is a set of discrete traditions regarding the Merkavah 6 Lohesh. Often used of incantations. 7 Β. M. Lewin, ed., 'Osarha-Geonim (Ierusalem: Hebrew University, 1931) 4 (Hagigah): 14. 8 Halperin, \"New Edition,\" 550. It is unclear whether Hai is working from purely literary sources (as Halperin assumes), from second-hand oral reports quoting this passage, or a combination of these. His statement there that \"this matter is well-known\" (mefursam ve-yedua') would argue against the view that he must have had the actual text of Hekhalot Zutarti before him. However, neither does it mean that his informants were first-hand wit­nesses to the phenomenon. 9 Heb. Le-faresh 'et ha-shem be-ferusho.

In the previous testimony (§423), Rabbi Akiba hears a voice (bat qol) from below the divine throne saying that the mystic who has been painstaking in the ascent and descent to the Merkavah will \"receive God's blessing three times a day, every day in the supernal court and in the earthly court in which they repeat [shonin\\ it.\" The blessings thus result from the recitation of the text. Similarly, §424 lists the benefits of reciting \"this Mishnah,\" that is, the ascent texts that precede it, which presumably contain the powerful divine name. This passage resembles statements found in the Shi'ur Qomah and other texts regarding the power of a book or tradition.14 In contrast to the body of the texts themselves, which deal with the journey to heaven or the nature of God, these testimonies promise very palpable rewards.15 Be­cause of its placement in the redactional structure of Hekhalot Zutarti, §424 then came to be regarded as describing the ascetic ritual that accom­panied the ascent of the tannaim to the Merkavah. This is probably how Hai Gaon understood it. Indeed, this interpretation made sense to the redactor who placed this testimony there in the first place. To him, the ascent texts in HekhalotZutarti were no less deserving of such a testimony than those texts in the corpus that have more practical goals, such as the Sar-Torah texts. Nor is the mention of a fasting ritual a surprising feature of this passage. Similar testimonies, especially in the introductions to magical books, make a point of specifying the exceptional conditions under which the book or tradition must be used. Among these conditions are ritual purity and a regimen of preparation. An introduction to a magical book from the Cairo Genizah (TS Kl .21) provides an example.16 The text enumerates the won­derful things the magical names and spells in the book will accomplish: 13 See Schafer, \"Aufbau und redactionelle Identitat der Hekhalot Zutarti.\" 14 See, for example, §377 (940) in Shi'ur Qomah; §500 (712), an independent testimony; and §547 (from Ma'aseh Merkavah). Note too that §§424-26 is followed in all of the princi­pal manuscripts in the Synopse except for MS. Munich 22 by §§489-95, which is also an elaborate ritual for reciting a book. On this literary pattern attesting to the origins and power of the text see Chapter 7. 15 So too a set of hymns that introduce Hekhalot Rabbati (§83-92) praises the glories (jfedullab) available to anyone who knows the text's secrets, including the ability to tell simply by looking at a person how many illegitimate ancestors he has, and the horrid punish­ments that will befall his enemies. On these hymns see Wewers, \"Uberlegenheit.\" 16 This introduction is parallel to the introduction to Sefer ha-Malbush (printed in Sefer Raziel [Amsterdam, 1701], fol. 2b), and to Sefer ha-Razim, 2:8-10; cf. 5:34-35.

The inclusion of ritual prescriptions in Hekhalot and magical texts thus has a rhetorical as well as practical function.21 RITUAL IN THE SAR-TORAH TEXTS In the extant Hekhalot literature, then, fasting is not explicitly prescribed for the purpose of the vision of the Merkavah. Rather, regimens of fasts, abstentions, and ablutions occur primarily in the Sar-Torah literature and the related texts examined above. These texts, rather than providing in­structions for ascent to heaven, concern the conjuration of an angel to come to the practitioner. This is a peculiar genre of ritual literature. As we have seen, most of the rituals are set into a highly formalized narrative framework. In the Sar-Torah narratives, instructions on how to perform the ritual are usually given to the narrator by his teacher and are followed by a story attesting to its success. These passages were composed in such a way as to highlight the ritual and recommend it to the reader. They are thus in some sense ritual texts, but are not purely prescriptive. PRINCIPAL FEATURES OF THE RITUALS Several types of ritual activities are prevalent in the principal texts. In describing them, it is important to establish a cultural and conceptual framework that makes these texts comprehensible. We therefore must cast our net rather broadly, into a wide range of halakhic, midrashic, and ancient Mediterranean sources. One element common to all of these rituals is the recitation of a set of powerful divine names. It is clear from their structure that the name is the principal ingredient that gives the rituals their efficacy. Emphasis on the names of God and the angels is also an indispensable characteristic of Jewish magic in general.22 The active ingredient in the Sar-Torah ritual 19 The word bshr is written above the line and the letters byn have been crossed out. 20 Cf. Ma'aseh Merkavah §544, on how the prayers for seeing the Merkavah are to be recited: \"[there must be] purity and holiness in his heart, and he recites a prayer.\" 21 On this point see also Swartz, \"Book and Tradition.\" 22 See Trachtenberg, Jewish Magic, 78-103; Swartz, \"Scribal Magic,\" 179; SchifFman and Swartz, Incantation Texts, 40-43."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"158 CHAPTER 6 taught by Rabbi Nehuniah to Rabbi Ishmael is a set of names called the \"Great Crown.\" Many isolated paragraphs in the Hekhalot corpus consist of little more than instructions for recitation of a name. One of the most striking of such rituals appears in a difficult Aramaic text (§§489-95) which identifies itself as a marvelous book containing an all-purpose \"Great Name.\"23 In talmudic tradition the divine name is to be recited and taught under special ritual circumstances. B. Qid. 71 describes the benefits that accrue to anyone who knows and preserves the forty-two-letter name in purity.24 So too our rituals, which emphasize the recitation of divine names, are concerned with reciting those names in ritual purity. Fasting and Diet One of the most persistent components of these rituals is the requirement to fast. In most cases the term \"fast\" refers to partial fasting or special dietary restrictions for a certain period of time. In many texts which prescribe fasts for long periods the reader is then told that he must eat bread baked with his own hands. In some cases a full fast takes place during the daytime only, or for a few days. Common durations of such fasts are forty days and three days. The number forty is no doubt based on Moses' sojourn on Mount Sinai (Exod. 24:18). Likewise, the Israelites were instructed to prepare for three days to receive the Decalogue (Exod. 19:15). The practitioner thus replicates the preconditions for revelation in his reception of the secrets of Torah.25 Fasting is a particularly salient example of the multivalence of ritual behavior. Fasts occur for a wide variety of motives in ancient Judaism and its environment.26 There are fasts of contrition, both statutory and occa­sional, the most prominent of these being Yom Kippur. Fasting and re­fraining from several pleasures—including wine, meat, and sexual rela­tions—are ritual signs of mourning.27 There is also evidence in ancient Judaism for fasting for mantic purposes, equivalent to the practice of 23 A portion of this text has been translated by Gruenwald, \"Manichaeism and Judaism,\" 267-70. The text is notable because it combines many of the principal ritual and rhetorical motifs of the Sar-Torah and allied texts into a coherent whole, although its purpose is not for the cultivation of that particular angel. 24 On this and related sources see Schiffman, \"Forty-Two Letter Divine Name.\" 25 Cf. also the Aramaic Sar-Torah ritual in Ma'aseh Merkavah (§§572-78), in which a fast from the new moon of Sivan to Shavuot is prescribed, thus reinforcing the link with Moses' revelation. The relationship of the Sar-Torah literature to midrashim about Moses' ascent has been analyzed extensively in Halperin, Faces of the Chariot. 26 See Fraade, \"Ascetical Aspects\"; cf. Chapter 1. 27 On the meaning of these patterns see Gary A. Anderson, A Time to Mourn, A Time to Dance (University Park: Penn State University Press, 1991)."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"RITUAL AND PURITY 159 mantic fasting in the Greco-Roman world described by Rudolph Arbes-mann.28 A story in the Palestinian Talmud tells of rabbis who fasted at a graveyard to see Rabbi Hiyya the Great in a dream.29 The Babylonian Talmud (b. Sanh. 65b) discusses those who fast so that an \"unclean spirit\" may rest on them. Some sources concern individuals who fast to bring down a \"man of dreams\" ('ish halom), that is, an angel appointed over dreams who answers the dreamer's questions.30 Sar-Torah rituals often specify certain kinds of food that are forbidden. A few such texts advise the practitioner not to eat meat or fish; the magical text quoted above refers to \"anything that produces blood.\" Abstention from meat plays a part in an important source for asceticism in the early rabbinic period, the story of the \"mourners of Zion\" of the first century who supposedly abstained from meat and wine as a sign of mourning and because of its use in the fallen Temple.31 This story, in which Yohanan ben Zakkai persuades the sect to modify their mourning practices, is usually seen as an example of rabbinic discouragement of ascetic practices.32 However, it can also be seen as an indicator of the range of foods and actions considered to be luxurious and thus inappropriate.33 An interesting use of the motif of the ritual fast is found in Version B of the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah. In this story, Rabbi Ishmael, who is thirteen years old, is in great affliction because of his inability to retain his learning. He tries to remedy the situation on his own: \"When I saw that my learning was not remaining with me, I stood and refrained [ tafasti asmi\\ from eating, drinking, washing, anointing, and sexual activity, and no word of song or melody passed from my mouth\" (§308). Rabbi IshmaePs practice is reminiscent of old mourning rituals and penitential and petitionary rituals for Yom Kippur and times of drought.34 This cluster of activities constitutes signs of joy that are restricted in times of crisis or mourning.35 Rabbi IshmaePs fast is thus a sign of his contrition 28 Rudolph Arbesmann, \"Fasting and Prophecy in Pagan and Christian Antiquity,\" Tra-ditio 7 (1949): 9-32; cf.

Rabbi Nehuniah then rescues him by taking him from his fa­ther's house to the Temple and having him adjure by the Great Seal, a magical name. This name accomplishes the task and is subsequently rec­ommended to the reader. It is therefore an effective substitute for Rabbi IshmaePs fast. However, in a similar story that appears a few paragraphs below,36 young Rabbi Ishmael has been fasting for forty days for the same purpose. He manages to bring down Yofiel, the Angel of the Presence, who pro­ceeds to question his motives. After being assured that Rabbi Ishmael conjured him for the sake of heaven,37 the angel instructs him in the correct procedure: \"Whoever wants it to be revealed to him38 must sit fasting for forty days, perform twenty-four immersions every day, and not eat anything defiling. He must not look at a woman, and must sit in a totally dark house\" (§314). Whereas the behavior described here is similar to Rabbi Ishmael's above, the emphasis has shifted from the patterns of mourning to the Rabbi Ishmael's physical purity. One intriguing detail that appears in several of these texts is the prohibi­tion of certain kinds of vegetables. The Sar-Torah texts in Merkavah Rab-bah and Hekhalot Rabbati tell the mystic to avoid vegetables of every kind. The incantation for the Great Name instructs, \"He shall not eat onion, garlic, or garden vegetables\";39 so too the magical manual quoted above. The exact reason for these prohibitions is unclear. One possibility may reside in their susceptibility to ritual impurity. Unlike Daniel's beans, \"wet\" foods can contract impurity more easily.40 Arbesmann notes the custom of \"xerophagy\" among the Montanists, who, according to Ter-tullian, refrained from meat, wine, succulent fruit, and anything juicy.41 If the authors advised avoidance of luxuries like meat and wine, they may also have had in mind the memory of onions and garlic that prompted the Israelites to complain to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai (Num. 11:5).42 the expression of grief and a ritual act in itself; see Idel, Kabbalah: New Perspectives, 75-88; cf. Himmelfarb, Ascent to Heaven, 107-8. 36 §§313-14. A parallel to this story also appears in Ma'aseh Merkavah; see Swartz, Mysti­cal Prayer, 86-89. 37 Rabbi Ishmael says, \"I did not bring you down for my glory, but to do the will of your creator\" (reading kevodi for the manuscript's kevodekha, \"your glory,\" which may be a pious circumlocution). Cf. Jonathan ben Uzziel's reply in b. Meg. 3a to the heavenly voice that rebukes him for revealing divine secrets in his Targum. 38 This clause is in Aramaic. 39 §489. 40 The Mishnah tractate Makhshirim, based on Lev. 11:34 and 38, is built on this assump­tion; on foods that are under presumption of impurity, see chapter 6 of that tractate. 41 Arbesmann, \"Fasting and Prophecy,\" 2, n. 9, citing Tertullian De ieiunio 1. 42 Cf.

Here too a pattern of avoidance is reflected. Persistent in the instructions is the injunction that the practitioner should \"eat bread of his own hands.\"44 More specifically, he should not eat bread baked by a woman 45 This detail is part of a larger emphasis on avoiding any trace of menstrual impurity, and can be placed with other such precautions. The Sar-Torah ritual in Section 2 of Ma'aseh Merkavah contains an instruction to \"eat one's bread with salt.\"46 The same phrase appears in an appendix to m. Avot (Avot 6:4) to exemplify the Sage's simple life.47 The Aramaic Sar-Torah text in Ma'aseh Merkavah (§§571-78) involves an unusual ritual of eating and drinking. The practitioner is instructed to make a certain kind of \"cooked bread\"48 and go down to the river. He then performs a ritual involving writing magical names on leaves and a silver cup, dissolving them in wine, and drinking the wine. This stands in contrast to the prohibition of wine in other Sar-Torah rituals. However, several magical texts include incantations to be recited over wine.49 One detail provides a clue to some of these specific dietary prohibitions. In the course of a ritual for the Sar-Torah to be practiced supposedly by a disciple of the sages (talmid hakham), the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah ben ha-Qannah prohibits what it calls \"any thing filthy\" (kol davar mezo-ham).50 One might ask, as Halperin has done, what kind of advanced rabbinical student would eat unclean or defiling foods.51 One possible answer to this question is that the term mezoham or zohama' probably does not refer to foods that are forbidden to all Jews according to Leviticus 43 Cf. also Gruenwald, \"Manichaeism and Judaism,\" 269-70. Gruenwald cites sources that maintain that vegetables compromise one's health and notes that Mani and the El-chasaites refrained from certain kinds of vegetables. Garlic was also seen as an aphrodisiac throughout the Mediterranean, and it may have been avoided in these rituals because it would encourage seminal emission.

Qam. 82a. 44 See §§299, 684, and 489. 45 §489 and G19, line 12. 46 §560. 47 Chapter 6 of Avot is a post-mishnaic composition known as Pereq Qinyan Torah and appears at the end of that tractate as well as in extracanonical tractates. See M. B.

Another possibility is that it refers to impure foods, or at least foods that do not match the peculiar criteria for purity found in these texts. Foods that are not forbidden but are contaminated with ritual impurity may be eaten by lay Israelites, and especially outside of the land of Israel. Even if in the fictional setting of this story, the Temple mount, Rabbi Nehuniah and Rabbi Ishmael would have had to eat their food in purity, it could not have been taken for granted that the reader would need to do so—especially if, as is plausible, he lived in the diaspora.53 Sexual Purity and Social Avoidance Concern with sexual purity is an essential element of these rituals. This concern is manifest in two related ways: the prohibition of sexual activity and seminal emission,54 and a deep concern with menstrual purity. Here too the injunction at Sinai not to go near a woman (Exod. 19:15) provides a precedent for the individual's encounter with the Sar-Torah. Although m. Ber. 3:4 prohibits a man who has had a seminal emission from reciting the blessing over the Shema', the parallel in Tosefta explicitly permits other categories of impure persons to study.55 However, as Shaye Cohen ob­serves, although the restrictions on the ejaculant in the synagogue are older and more authentic, they were largely ignored in many Jewish com­munities in favor of unauthorized popular restrictions on menstruants.56 The concern with menstrual impurity, niddah, forms the basis for some of the most historically significant details in this literature. The require­ment mentioned above that the practitioner eat \"bread of his own hands\" serves two allied purposes. It allows him to maintain his isolation, which is 52 Cf. b. Shab. 108a, where the term zohama refers to foul odors. 53 Cf., however, b. Nid. 20b and 52b, where zhm is clearly distinguished from menstrual impurity. For evidence of the Sar-Torah practice in the diaspora see §305. 54 The reader is sometimes instructed that if an emission occurs, he must bathe and repeat the entire regimen from the first day, as the resulting pollution has invalidated the entire preparation.

In fact, in parallel texts the injunction to eat lehem yadav, \"bread of his own hands,\" alternates in the versions with the prohibition of lehem 'ishah, \"bread of a woman.\" The intricacies of rabbinic and non-rabbinic laws and customs of the menstru-ant woman (niddah) also play a part in the primary ritual text in the ascent traditions, the deposition of Rabbi Nehuniah from heaven, which are examined below. The isolation of the individual is reinforced in a general way. According to the Sar-Torah text in Hekhalot Rabbati (§299), the practitioner must sleep alone for twelve days in a room or attic. In one version of the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah (§314), he is to sit in a dark house. Some texts prohibit looking at women or other people. In one case Rabbi Ishmael is to keep his eyes down and does not even look at colored material.58 A Genizah fragment stipulates: \"He goes and sits in a house by himself, and he should be in fasting all day and does not eat bread of a woman and does not look either at a man or a woman. And when he walks in the mar­ketplace he averts his eyes from all creatures and does not look even at a one-day-old child.\"59 The Aramaic incantation for the Great Name in­structs: \"He must not see the face of a male or female twin, nor see the face of a male or female leper,60 nor see the face of a male or female with a discharge,61 nor see the face of a menstruant woman\" (§489). This passage lists, for the most part, classes of persons who are unclean according to biblical law. Lepers, those who have an abnormal flux (zov), and menstruants are all impure according to Lev. 13-15.62 The taboo on twins, however, is a mysterious detail. Research thus far has turned up no such taboo in classical Judaism. Indeed, b. Yeb. 98a states that twins are simply the result of the splitting of a drop of semen, and therefore, pre­sumably, an explainable and natural phenomenon. It is possible that this statement was intended to refute a folk-belief to the opposite effect—one that is reflected in our text. Another possibility is raised by Gruenwald's observation that according to Song of Songs Rabbah and parallels, twins are susceptible to each other's diseases.63 Thus, the twin you meet in the 57 See below. 58 §560.

These prohibitions, then, not only go beyond the halakhic norm, but reflect concepts at odds with the rabbinic purity system. How­ever, the authors are not oblivious to that system; nor are these practices merely an eccentric hyperextension of normative purity rituals thought up by an individual. There is evidence that other Jews in late antiquity and the early Middle Ages also considered pollution to be something that could occur even through the most casual contact with the contaminated person—in this case, the menstruant. A curious text known as Bmitn de-Massekhet Niddah, which purports to relate extratalmudic statements of the sages regarding menstruation, claims that the impurity of niddah can be transmitted through the earth on which the menstruant walks and even through her speech or breath.65 A medieval legend illustrates the notion that looking at an impure creature is enough to contaminate or harm a person. This text is a miraculous birth narrative about Rabbi Ishmael, the hero of the Hekhalot literature.66 In this tale, Ishmael's saintly mother and father are distressed because she has not borne a child that survived. The couple decides that she must immerse in a ritual bath before they conceive. Then \"she immersed, and she encountered a pig.

IlOa-114a, which discusses the practice of avoiding pairs when eating, drinking, and attending to one's bodily needs; doing these in pairs is said to make one vulner­able to demons. However, there is no suggestion there that the taboo would be extended to the avoidance of human pairs. 65 Braita de-Massekhet Niddah, in Chaim M. Horovitz, Tosefta 'Atiqta pt. 5 (Frankfurt a.

She went back and immersed.\"67 After forty such instances, The Holy One, Blessed be He instructs Gabriel to tell her that she has more than proven her piety (in fact, that she has gone too far) and that she would be rewarded with little Ishmael. According to halakhah, contact with a live pig does not produce impurity—nor, as we have seen, does the mere sight of anything defiling. But there are numerous examples of the belief that looking at a particular kind of animal or person—especially a menstruating woman—can affect one physically.68 B. Pes. Illa states that if a woman at the beginning of her period passes before two men, she will kill one of them.69 We need not presume that the authors of the Sar-Torah texts knew these texts, although they may be contemporary with some of this literature. Rather, both genres reflect popular notions that each uses to its purpose. Ablutions and Cleansing Ablutions accompany the regimen at some point in the rituals. These are explicitly designated as purificatory rituals. Section 299 instructs the reader to \"wash his garments and cloaks and perform a stringent immer­sion rendering him free from any doubt of nocturnal pollution.\" Note here the requirement to wash one's clothes, which was also commanded at Sinai in Exod. 19:10 and 14. In the Great Name ritual (§489) the practi­tioner must wear white garments; in the Sar-Torah ritual in Ma'aseh Mer-kavah (§560) he is not to look at colored fabric. In a few texts the ablution is to take place at a river.70 As Gruenwald and Moshe Idel have pointed 67 Horovitz, Tosefta 'Atiqta, 5:57. 68 See b. Shab. 129b, which warns that encountering a pig (davar aher) after bloodletting can lead to leprosy (Rashi, ad. Ioc., cites b. Qid. 49b that of the ten measures of skin afflic­tions [nega'im] that descended to the world, nine were taken by pigs). The legend in Gaster, Ma'aseh Book, is associated with the statement in b. Ber. 20a that R. Yohanan would stand outside the women's bathhouse so that the women would have children as handsome as he; the reasoning behind this version of the story is thus that if Rabbi Ishmael's mother had seen a pig, she would be thinking of it when she conceives. See Moses Gaster, The Exempla of the Rabbis, (1924; reprint, New York: Ktav, 1968), 145-46, 102, and 222. Cf. Num. R. chapter 9. In contrast, the purpose of the versions quoted by Horowitz is to demonstrate the merits of ritual immersion, which removes those harmful effects. As Cohen observes (\"Purity and Piety,\" 108), Braita de-Massekhet Niddah stresses the physical dangers of menstruation, con­trary to the prevailing rabbinic conception. 69 The comment in Tosafot ad loc. moderates this statement by explaining that if she had practiced witchcraft on him (kishuf), the power of her impurity will make it effective. Ac­cording to b. Shab. 110b, a woman can repel a snake by telling it she is in menstruation; cf. Rashi, ad loc.

Why must the human being undergo such an extraordinary level of purification in order to meet with the angels? We may locate a clue to this question in another set of texts relevant to our understanding of the role of purity in these rituals: rabbinic legends regarding rivalry between humans and angels, particularly those that concern Moses' ascent to heaven to receive the Torah.72 It is open to question whether the Moses stories constituted the sole or even the princi­pal source for the Sar-Torah genre and the Hekhalot tradition in gen­eral.73 But many details of these stories are relevant to this discussion of purity and ascesis in those literatures. The locus classicus for the ascent of Moses is in the Babylonian Talmud, b. Shab. 88b-89a. Important versions of this myth are also found in early medieval midrashim such as Pesiqta Rabbati.74 In the talmudic version, the angels protest to God about Moses' presence among them to receive the Torah, asking, \"What is one born of woman doing here among us?\" In Pesiqta Rabbati, chapter 20, an angel accuses Moses directly: \"You have come from a place of filth to a pure place; you born of woman, what are you doing in a place of fire?\"75 The angels' disparagement of Moses as one \"born of woman\" reminds 71 See Gruenwald, Apocalyptic, 135; Moshe Idel, \"Le-Gilgulehtih shel Tekhniqah Qedumah shel Hazon Nevu'i Bi-yeme ha-Benayim,\" Sinai 86 (1979-80): 1-7; Jacob Z.

In one passage, Metatron disturbs the heavenly hosts, who demand to know why the smell of this being \"born of woman\" is rising up to them.79 This unit is a brief tradition appended to Hekhalot Rabbati at §§147-49 in one manuscript and to the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah at §§315-17 in another.80 It is probably a late tradi­tion and may reflect the idea, which forms the basis for the narrative of 3 Enoch, that Metatron was once the earthling Enoch. Ablutions in the Sar-Torah rituals may therefore have the purpose not only of ridding the practitioner of ritual impurity, but of odors; so too the prohibitions of garlic and other foods that may cause bad breath and indigestion.81 But in these cases, the angels are not simply expressing contempt at the physical obnoxiousness of the human intruder; they are apparently con­cerned that he will pollute the angelic domain. Thus extraordinary puri­fication is necessary to approach their abode in heaven. In the same way, the individual who seeks to bring the angel to earth must not repulse him with his impurity. These midrashim depict Moses as undergoing a process of extraordinary purification in preparation for the revelation at Sinai. In b.

Yoma 75b, for example, whether or not angels eat.83 Visitors likewise do not eat, but rather, like the righteous according to Berakhot 17a, are \"nourished by the splendor of the Shekhinah.\"84 In some sources the angels (and humans in their presence) eat a particular kind of heavenly food.85 This idea may bear on the special preparations of bread found in some of our rituals. The notion that in order to be among the divine beings it is necessary to assume a state of ritual parity with them is an ancient idea that finds expression in this midrash and in the Hekhalot literature. According to Gary A. Anderson, Gilgamesh's friend Enkidu would be able to walk about in the netherworld unnoticed if he refrained from the joyous activities—like those proscribed in rabbinic literature in mourning and atonement—that distinguish the living.86 This would appear to be behind the necromantic fasting of the rabbis mentioned above. Likewise, in order to be indistinguishable from the angels, Moses must be empty of food. In Ma'aseh Merkavah, the ruse works too well. The Sar-Torah practitioner must protect himself by standing in a circle so that \"the demons will not come and liken him to the angels and kill him\" (§562).87 Moses wins the argument with the angels by citing the very physicality of humanity which was the grounds for their objections in the first place. That physicality is what permits human beings to observe the Torah. In b. Shab. 88b he points out: \"It is written, 'honor your father and mother' [Exod. 20:12 and Deut. 5:16]; do you have mothers and fathers?\" This argument can be seen as a clever refutation of the epithet yelud 'ishah, \"born of woman.\" In the Midrash to Psalms, God cites the laws of impu­rity, which the pure angels cannot observe.88 The angels, however, are not always depicted as creatures of pure spirit, impervious to the quasi-physical properties of matter that necessitate these procedures in the first place. Rather, they can merely afford to be more 82 This view is opposed by Mattiah ben Heresh. See also 'Avot de-Rabbi Natan, ed. Schechter, version A, chap. 1. 83 The discussion centers on the exegesis of Deut. 9:9 vs. Ps. 78:25. According to Lev. R. 34:8, Targum Ps.-Jonathan to Gen. 18:8, and one opinion in b. B. Mes. 86b, the three angels who visited Abraham were only pretending to eat and drink. For the sources on this subject see David Goodman, \"Do Angels Eat?\" JJS 37 (1986): 160-75. 84 Cf. Lev.

A particularly striking passage in a cosmological text, Seder Rabbab de-Bereshit, illustrates the idea that the angels themselves are not exempt from the ritual dynamics that allow the human practitioner to be in their presence.89 This passage describes the protocol of the heavenly liturgy, and particularly its dependence on the earthly liturgy of Israel.90 The heavenly chorus must wait for Israel on earth to recite the qedushah (Isa. 6:6) before they can recite theirs. How do they know when Israel has done so on earth? There is an angel named Shemu'el who stands every day at dawn and announces the prayers that rise from the synagogues and houses of study. When he does so, the angels immerse themselves in rivers of fire. At this point the text asks a perfectly reasonable question: (§181) And do the angels have flux [zov] and pollution, menstrual impu­rity [niddah], and [impurity of] childbirth, that they require immersion? Rather, [those who immerse are] the angels who are appointed over the labor of the world and descend every day to bring peace to the world—when the time comes for song, they go up to the firmament and because of the smell of human beings who are born of woman, possessors of impurity, possessors of flux and filth, they bathe themselves in fire and cleanse and purify and Ius-trate . . . themselves in fire until they make themselves holy, and they become like the ministering angels of the upper firmament [ 'aravot raqia']. The susceptibility to pollution on the part of the angels is not merely an esoteric notion, confined to the phenomenological fringes of Jewish reli­gious history. It is an echo of a significant aspect of biblical cultic theology: the volatility of the divine presence in biblical religion. As described by Baruch A. Levine,91 the Potent Presence of God required extremely deli­cate sanitary conditions to appear on earth; if these conditions were not met, the Deity had no choice but to react. It is this volatility that triggers the divine wrath against misguided intruders like Nadav and Avihu in Lev. 10:1-2. As Moses' subsequent consolation of Aaron demonstrates (Lev. 10:3), that wrath is less an emotional response to sin than a manifestation of God's holiness.92 It is in this context that we can understand a common motif in both the conjuration and ascent literatures: the wrath of the angels. We can see this motif in the Sar-Torah's rebuke of Rabbi Ishmael, but it manifests itself in the ritual itself. Repeatedly, the practitioner adjures them not to harm 89 Synopse §§790-91, MS. Oxf. 1531 and §§810-11 in the same manuscript (=§§180-81 in MS.

TkE DEPOSITION OF RABBI NEHUNIAH The ascent to the heavens and esoteric system of ritual purity are placed in striking conjunction in the story of Rabbi Nehuniah's deposition from heaven in HekhalotRabbati (§§225-28). This passage, which has prompted considerable discussion in recent years, is the principal source for under­standing the relationship of cultic purity with the idea of ascent to the Merkavah 94 The setting of the story is the Temple in Jerusalem. Rabbi Nehuniah is seated reciting the details of his ascent in the midst of his disciples. In order to ask their rabbi about a cryptic term he is using, his colleagues must bring him down from heaven. However, they must do so without causing him harm or sin. They thus employ an elaborate procedure in which a piece of fine cloth is touched by a woman who has completed her cycle, has immersed unsuccessfully, once, and has then immersed cor­rectly95 This woman would be impure only according to one of the sages. This cloth is placed on a bough of myrtle soaked in balsam oil and placed on Rabbi Nehuniah's knees. This has the effect of deposing him from before the heavenly throne. For Scholem,96 this story was proof of \"the halakhic character of Hekha-Iot mysticism\" and thus of its derivation from rabbinic circles. It is the passage in Hekhalot literature that bears the strongest affinities to rabbinic halakhah. However, it is more purely a narrative text than the prescriptive texts in our selection that concern a ritual undertaken by a rabbi.97 The 93 See, for example, §§558 (on which see Swartz, Mystical Prayer, 132-33), 569, and 624. 94 Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism, 9-13; Lawrence H.

Each of the steps taken have as their purpose the infusion of the cloth with a marginal degree of impurity. The woman is at a stage in her cycle, after she has immersed a first time, in which her purity is probable but not certain. Rabbi Nehuniah would then be made impure only in the opinion of a minority of sages.\" But, as Lieberman points out, in heaven the minority view with regard to purity prevails.100 The colleagues' solution was particularly ingenious, for it allowed them to bring him down without violating his earthly purity on the Temple mount. Thus interpreted, this procedure underscores the cul-tic dynamics of the ascent as conceived by the authors of Hekhalot Rab-bati: there are higher standards of ritual purity in heaven, but the function of purity is the same as in the biblical cult. Purity is a prerequisite for approaching the Potent Presence of God. Notwithstanding the story's obvious halakhic dimension, there are fac­tors mitigating against the argument that the story proves that the authors of the Hekhalot literature were the same rabbis responsible for the classical Talmuds and midrashim. One is that the halakhah is one but not the sole component of the ritual. As Schiffman and Schliiter point out, there is also a significant magical dimension to the praxis. This does not itself indicate nonrabbinic provenance, but it does suggest that the authors had other considerations in mind.101 More significantly, the halakhah on which they do rely is nonstandard. As Schliiter observes, the position of its authors is extrahalakhic.102 In fact, according to current scholarship on the subject, the Pharisaic and rabbinic purity systems deemphasized the cultic and localized nature everybody regardless of status. Such a recommendation occurs, for example, in §305, in which the narrative stresses that the Sar-Torah praxis is effective for the lowliest shepherd and is as potent outside of the land of Israel than within its boundaries. 98 The ascent is also undertaken because of an emergency: Rome's evil decree against Israel. Furthermore, Schliiter's textual analysis (\"Erzahlung,\" 84-95) shows that the ac­count of Rabbi Nehuniah's deposition is a later addition to this section of Hekbalot Rabbati. 99 Lieberman, \"Knowledge of Halakha,'\" 242, suggests that the minority would include Rabbi Eliezer, who was known to take a stricter position on purity. 100 Ibid. The myrtle branch dipped in balsam would serve to disguise the odor of the cloth according to Lieberman, or, in Schiffman's view, act as a magic wand that would like­wise affect the deposition and reinforce the action. 101 Schiffman, \"Recall,\" 275-81; Schliiter, \"Erzahlung,\" 107. 102 Schliiter, \"Erzahlung,\" 108-9."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"172 CHAPTER 6 of the biblical concept of purity.103 In the early rabbinic system, purity was no longer the sole property of those who needed to approach the divine presence in the Temple, but a duty of all Israel. This story, by contrast, reinforces the cultic notion. The presence is not, however, localized on Zion, but in the heavenly Temple.104 CONCLUSIONS Rituals in Hekhalot literature have largely been interpreted according to the assumption that their principal meaning can be found in the intention to produce a mystical state. It is certainly not difficult to imagine that the individual who follows these procedures might achieve a vision of the an­gel he wishes to conjure, or of the heavenly array. But if we make this idea the primary vehicle for interpreting these practices, we miss much of their significance. This analysis has shown that rituals in Hekhalot literature re­flect distinct ritual goals and can be read within the context of the tradi­tional and mythic worlds of their time. As the Sar-Torah practitioner sees it, he must prepare for an encounter with divine beings who are sensitive to terrestrial pollution and are easily provoked. Taking as his initial model his ancestors' approach to the divine presence at Sinai and Zion, he then seeks to rid himself of all physical traces of his humanness through ritual purification using techniques drawn from halakhah, Jewish folk beliefs, and Greco-Roman magic. The forego­ing analysis suggests that it is this conception, no less than the conscious­ness of the individual, that influences the details of these ritual procedures. 103 See especially Neusner, Purities; idem, The Idea of Purity; and Baruch M. Bokser, \"Approaching Sacred Space,\" HTR 78 (1985): 279-99. 104 To be sure, many passages in rabbinic literature can be found that do reflect this older concept. See for example, Avot de-Rabbi Natan, chap. 34 and A. Aptowitzer, uBet ha-Miqdash shel Ma'alah 'al Pi ha-'Aggadah,\" Tarbis 2 (1931): 137-53 and 257-87.

The hymn praises God as the revealer of mysteries \"to Moses, and Moses to Joshua, and Joshua to the Elders, and the Elders to the Prophets, and the Prophets to the Hasidim, and the Hasidim to the Fearers of the Name,1 and the Fearers of the Name to the men of the Great Assembly, and the men of the Great Assembly . . . to all Israel.\" These lines are based on one of the most famous passages in all of rab­binic literature: the opening of the Mishnah tractate Avot, known as the chain of tradition, which enumerates the stages in transmission of the Torah from Moses to the rabbinic sages. This text is often seen as a mani­festo of rabbinic Judaism. The Sar-Torah hymn's affinity with and di­vergence from Avot underscore an important tension in the Sar-Torah texts and in Hekhalot literature in general. We have seen that the Sar-Torah stories and practices were deeply bound up with the rabbinic ethos of the study of Torah. Sar-Torah rituals also used biblical and rabbinic legal and ritual patterns for their own pur­poses. Nevertheless, there are indications that the authors of these texts were not identical with those who produced the classical works of the rabbinic canon. They drew from other sources, including magical litera­ture and popular religion, for narrative and ritual patterns. They thus rec­ognized the validity of the rabbinic system, but stood somewhat apart from its priorities and concerns. In this chapter, the issue of the complex relationship between the Sar-Torah literature and rabbinic Judaism is further defined through an exam­ination of an important set of patterns in Hekhalot and magical literature: a set of literary genres that apply tradition, authority, and ideal figures to the purpose of validating the magic or mystical practice of the text. These motifs can tell us much about how their authors saw themselves and their place in society. This discussion goes beyond the specifics of the Sar-Torah tradition, toward our understanding of the social context of Hekhalot and cognate literatures. 1 MS.

In the case of any important magic we invariably find the story accounting for its existence. Such a story tells when and where it entered the posses­sion of man, how it became the property of a local group, or of a family or clan. Magic never \"originated,\" it has never been made or invented. . . . The spell, the rite, and the thing which they govern are coeval.\"2 These remarks follow shortly after another set of observations regarding tradition and particularly its transmission in religion in general. According to Malinowski, \"The transmission and conservation of sacred tradition en­tails publicity.\" In order to assure belief, the society requires assurance that its truths are \"held in safekeeping, handed on exactly as received. . . . Ev­ery religion must have its tangible, reliable safeguards by which the au­thenticity of its tradition is guaranteed.\"3 Malinowski's comments have an interesting relevance to the study of early Jewish mysticism and magic. His latter remarks regarding religion and transmission are cited in Gerson Cohen's introduction to Ibn Daud's Sefer ha-Qabbalah.A Cohen, in the course of describing Islamic and rabbinic precedents to ibn Daud's histo­riography, emphasizes the validating function of the rabbinic \"chain of tradition\" motif, most prominent in Avot and Avot de-Rabbi Natan: \"For a practice to be ritually valid,\" he observes, \"it had to be supported by tradition.\" Cohen cites Malinowski in order to make the point that the Muslim interest in validating attestation (isnad) need not have been a product of Jewish influence, since such interests exist in every civilization, which \"preserves or fabricates some genealogical attestation of the families and/or traditions which it seeks to legitimate.\"5 If, as Cohen implies, Malinowski's observations regarding religious cul­tures in general have their counterpart in the rabbinic chain of tradition and its heirs, his statements regarding magical traditions have their coun­terpart as well in the literature of Jewish magic and mysticism of late antiq­uity and the early Middle Ages. These literatures carry with them their own genres of validating myths authenticating their practices and magical devices. Several of these, in fact, are directly related to the rabbinic chain of tradition and can tell us about both. 2 Malinowski, Magic, Science and Religion, 74-75. 3 Ibid., 67-68. 4 Gerson Cohen, A Critical Edition with a Translation and Notes of the Book of Tradition (Seferha-Qabbalah) by Abraham Ibn Daud (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1967), p.

This chapter will focus on two of these. One is a variant on the chain of tradition, in which the text testifies that the magical ritual, divine name, or book of magic was handed down through a succession of ideal figures to be available to the practitioner. The other, related, motif concerns the power of the magical book or mystical tract and is found in introductions and testimonies attached to Hekhalot texts and magical books. Historical and Theoretical Considerations An important model for this inquiry is provided by Hans Dieter Betz in his analysis of the role of tradition in Greco-Roman magical literature.6 There he notes that as the magical practitioner functions as an individual,7 one might be surprised to find magicians striving consciously to define their tradition. Like Malinowski, Betz observes that since \"no magician who is worth his reputation would ever claim to have invented or made up his own spells,\"8 he is thus reliant on a concept of tradition. The authors of the magical texts address this need through self-definition, systematiza-tion, and the devising of myths regarding the origins and transmission of their magic. Corresponding examples of this tendency can easily be found in Jewish magical texts, particularly in the motifs we shall examine regarding the succession of ideal figures who first received and preserved the magical tradition. Hekhalot and Sar-Torah texts, too, strive to define their tradi­tion in similar ways, principally by means of pseudepigraphic attribution of texts to great rabbis, and through such validating techniques as the chains of tradition and testimonies analyzed here. THE CHAIN OF TRADITION MOTIF It is generally understood that the chains of tradition in Hekhalot litera­ture are based on the model in Avot. Therefore, we will map affinities and contrasts in the ethos, operating principles, and historical implications of the variations on this form in Hekhalot and magical texts in comparison to the rabbinic prototype. 6 Hans Dieter Betz, \"The Formation of Authoritative Tradition in the Greek Magical Papyri,\" in Jewish and Christian Self-Definition, ed.

Sanders, (Phila­delphia: Fortress Press, 1983), 3: 161-70. 7 On this aspect of the social position of the magician, see Emil Durkheim, The Elemen­tary Forms of Religious Life (New York: Free Press, 1965), 59-60. 8 Betz, \"Authoritative Tradition,\" 162."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"176 CHAPTER 7 In Rabbinic Litemture The paradigmatic rabbinic chain of tradition occurs at the beginning of m. Avot, and, with minor variations, in the two principal recensions of Avot de-Rabbi Natan.9 Although related passages appear in rabbinic liter­ature, they have not been as influential.10 The first chapter of m. Avot is generally acknowledged to be one of the most important texts for our understanding of the nature of early rabbinic Judaism. It presents what is considered to be the principal validating myth of rabbinism: that the Torah given to Moses at Sinai was handed down to the elders and prophets of biblical Israel, through Second Temple groups considered to be the intellectual and political forerunners of the Pharisees and rabbis, and to the rabbis themselves: \"Moses received the Torah from Sinai and handed it down to Joshua, and Joshua to the Elders, and the Elders to the Prophets, and the Prophets to the Men of the Great Assem­bly.\" As the chain progresses in both Avot and Avot de-Rabbi Natan, it takes the form of lemmata affixed to rabbinic maxims, extending forward through the early generations of the tannaim.11 This myth embodies several important concepts. It is a dramatic illustra­tion of the idea of tradition. Revelation is not given anew to each sage or generation, but has come to Israel from Moses through the mediation of the succession of masters and disciples. Yet the Torah is not simply a docu­ment passed from one pair of hands to another. It is associated with a process by which the Torah's wisdom is elaborated by each successive gen­eration.12 In the first mishnah of Avot, the initial list of tradents culminates 9 For a table illustrating the variations between versions of the chain, see Anthony Saldarini, Scholastic Rabbinism: A Literary Study of the Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan (Chico, Calif.: Scholars Press, 1982), 68-69. It is commonly understood that the versions in the two rescensions of Avot de-Rabbi Natan derive from a separate recension of Avot from that contained in our mishnah. See Judah Goldin, The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1983), xix-xx; J. N. Epstein, Mevo'ot Ie-Sifrut ha-Tanna'im (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1957), 232-33; and Lerner, \"The External Tractates,\" 370-71. 10 See, for example, y. Sanh. 10:1 (28a) and parallels, on which see n. below. 11 There appear to be two conclusions to this chain in Avot. While 1:16-2:7 extends from Hillel and Shammai through the Patriarchs, 2:8-16 ends with the disciples of Yohanan ben Zakkai. Avot de-Rabbi Natan arranges the patriarchal succession independently of the disci­ples of Yohanan. See Anthony Saldarini, \"The End of the Rabbinic Chain of Tradition,\" JBL 93 (1974):97-106. 12 Cf. y. Sanh. 10:1 (28a) (cf. Eccl. R. 12:11) which, quoting m. Avot 1:1, likens the Torah to a \"girls' ball\" or \"shuttlecock\" tossed from one player's hands to another's. See William G. Braude, Pesikta Rabbati (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1968), 61-62 n. 7.

From here on, Chapters 1 and 2 consist of statements of the individuals who received the tradition. Ac­cording to Steven Fraade, this device, by which each teacher \"adds one or more teachings to what he has received,\" serves to emphasize that the texts of rabbinic literature \"not only transmit received traditions form an earlier time, but simultaneously and often subtly transform—for purposes of their own place and program in time—what they seek to transmit.\"14 The myth is also significant for its social and political implications. Priests and Davidic kings, who ruled Israel for most of its history before 70 CE, do not appear as clearly defined groups.15 The sages and their predecessors thus displace these groups as authorities.16 The rabbinic chain of tradition itself is not without its antecedents. Elias Bickerman, Henry Fischel, Anthony Saldarini, and others have shown that the chain of tradition motif must be placed within the context of Greco-Roman scholastic rhetoric. From Homer to the Cynics, authority of a class and authenticity of an intellectual process has been validated by the use of specific literary forms that depict the origins and stage-by-stage transmis­sion of the tradition through a sequence of scholars or rulers.17 This cul­tural factor is relevant to our exploration of the trajectory of this motif 13 On this group see below. 14 Steven D. Fraade, From Tradition to Commentary: Torah and Its Interpretation in the Midrash Sifre to Deuteronomy (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1991), 69-70. According to Jacob Neusner, Torah: From Scroll to Symbol in Formative Judaism (Phila­delphia: Fortress Press, 1985), 56, Avot equates Torah with the sayings of the sages; this equation \"is a fact validated by the association of what they say with their own names'\" (italics in the original). Solomon Schechter (Avot de-Rabbi Natan [London/Vienna/Frankfort, 1887], p. xxiv) provides an interesting rationale for the chain of tradition: \"There is no suggestion of any of the words of this tractate in Scripture at all, and if they were not sup­ported by the reception of these tradents [qabbalat ha-meqablim\\, they would be floating in the air.\" 15 This is the case, although individuals in the chain, such as Simeon the Just, were them­selves supposed to have been priests. On Simeon's place in the chain see Jacob Neusner, The Rabbinic Traditions about the Pharisees before 70 (Leiden: Brill, 1971), 18-19. Moreover, the Hillelite dynasty and through them the Patriarchs claimed Davidic ancestry. 16 According to Louis Finkelstein, Mavo' Ie-Massekhtot 'Avot ve-'Avot de-Rabbi Natan (New York: Jewish Theological Seminary, 1950), xxix, the early authorities \"claimed for themselves equal, and not sole, authority\" with that of the priests.

Even if instances of this pattern in Hekhalot literature are based on the Avot tradition, its importance for the authors was probably reinforced by its currency in the wider Mediterra­nean culture. The Chain of Tradition in Hekhalot Literature In Hekhalot literature, chains of tradition occur in four passages. This discussion will proceed with an analysis of the literary context of these texts. Then, after a brief assessment of some of their historical implications, their meaning within the esoteric traditions will be explored. The four passages can be separated into two groups. The first group consists of a passage that appears in a few manuscripts at the end of 3 Enoch (§80), and a related passage that appears with Shi'ur Qomah in various manuscripts (§724=397=474). Both seem to be appendixes and are not integral to the central concerns of 3 Enoch or Shi'ur Qomah. The second group consists of a hymn found, with variations, in Merkavah Kab­bah and Ma'aseh Merkavah. 3 ENOCH The first passage we will examine was published by H. Odeberg as chapter 48D of 3 Enoch18 and in the Synopse as §80.19 It appears in an indepen­dent collection of traditions (§§71-80) concerning the \"seventy names of Metatron,\" which was appended to 3 Enoch.20 It is likely that some, if not all, components of the collection originated in the Alphabet of Rabbi Akiba.21 In §79, the angels voice their opposition to the presence of Meta-18 Hugo Odeberg, 3 Enoch, or the Hebrew Book of Enoch, 2nd ed. (New York: Ktav, 1973), 74 (in the Hebrew text) and 178-79 (English text). See also the translation of Alexander, \"3 Enoch,\" 315. 19 Among the manuscripts in the Synopse, the passage only appears in MSS. Munich 22 (M22) and Vatican 228 (V228). According to Schafer, \"Handschriften,\" 194 and 197, the passage also appears in Oxford MSS. 1656 and 2872; in the latter manuscript it appears in the framework of the Alphabet of Rabbi Akiba. The same recension of 3 Enoch seems to appear in MS. NY 1737. See Schafer, \"Handschriften,\" 222 and 225-28. 20 See Odeberg, 3 Enoch, 172-79, Alexander, \"3 Enoch,\" 224-25, 310-15; and Hal-perin, Faces of the Chariot, 417-20. This collection of traditions consists of three principal units: §§71-75 (Odeberg, chs. 48B and C), an abbreviated account of Enoch's transforma­tion, the core of which is §§71-72 (§§937-38); §§76-77 (Odeberg, chap. 48D; cf. §§387-88), in which a list of the seventy names is followed by an account of how the Sar-Torah Yefefiyah bestowed a forgetful Moses with Torah on Mt. Sinai; and §§78-80 (the latter half of Odeberg's ch. 48D), which depicts the angels' objection to Metatron's presence and concludes with the chain of tradition under discussion. Halperin (Faces of the Chariot, 417), refers to §§76-80 as the \"Moses/Metaron text.\" On the tradition of seventy names, see Dan, \"The Seventy Names of Metatron.\" 21 The texts of the two recensions of the Alphabet of Rabbi Akiba are printed in Jellinek,"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"TRADITION AND AUTHORITY 179 tron, who is the transformed Enoch, among them. In §80, God answers their objection by declaring that to Metatron alone among the angels has he entrusted the secrets or names.22 He continues: \"And Metatron may take them23 out of My storehouse.\" And he handed24 them to Moses, and Moses to Joshua, and from Joshua to the Elders, and from the Elders to the prophets, and from the prophets to the men of the Great Assembly and from the men of the Great Assembly to Ezra the Scribe and from Ezra the Scribe to Hillel the Elder, and [from] Hillel to K Abbahu and from R. Abbahu to R. Zeira, and from R. Zeira to the Men of Faith, and from the Men of Faith to the Possessors of Faith,25 to be circumspect with it and to heal all the diseases that are widespread in the world. As it is said, \"If you will diligentiy hearken to the voice of the Lord your God, and will do what is right in His eyes, and will listen to his commandments, and keep all His statutes, all the diseases that I have put upon the Egyptians I will not put on you, for I am the Lord who heals you\" [Exod. 15:26], Metatron brings down secrets and names to the earth over the objection of the angels. He does so through the agency of Moses. This text follows the pattern of the legends of the angelic opposition to Moses' reception of the Torah.26 It proceeds after the pattern of the transmission of Torah through the chain of tradition. However, in this case the object of the transmission is not the Torah itself, but magical names designated for the purpose of healing. Healing is one of the most important functions of magical names in amulets.27 In addition, Moses' reception of Torah is Bet Ha-Midrash 3:12-64; and Wertheimer, Bate Midrashot, 2:333-418. On this text see K. Kohler, \"Akiba ben Joseph, Alphabet of,\" /£1:310-311. Paragraphs §§71-72 of 3 Enoch preserve the acrostic structure of the alphabet, indicating that they originated there. But the subsequent passages may be independent. 22 It is not clear from the text exactly what it was that God imparted to Metatron. The passage may be referring to the secret (mz), mentioned earlier in the text, by which the heaven and earth were created. 23 Referring, perhaps, to divine names. 24 Reading wmsr, with MS. V228. MS. M22 has wmwsrw, \"and he [may] hand it.\" In the previous clause, V228 has the participle mosi' (\"he [may] take\"), and the verb is lacking in MS. M22. Thus it is difficult to tell whether this is a resumption of the narrative in the past tense, or a continuation of God's speech. Cf. Alexander's translation, \"3 Enoch,\" 315. 25 Alexander, \"3 Enoch,\" 315, renders this term as \"faithful.\" 26 Alexander, \"3 Enoch,\" 315, Halperin, Faces of the Chariot, 419-20. On the pattern cf. Chapter 6 above; Schultz, \"Angelic Opposition;\" and Schafer, Rivalitat. 27 See Schiffman and Swartz, Incantation Texts, 46-47. The association of Exod. 15:26 with magical healing is well attested in rabbinic and magical sources. Cf. m.

Shab. 89a and Chapter 20 of Pesiqta Rabbati. As Hal-perin shows, the idea that Moses brought down not only the Torah but secrets of healing is based on an exegesis of Ps. 68:19 found in several midrashim.28 In these midrashim, the angels, whose opposition has been overcome by Moses, present him with the \"gifts\" mentioned in Ps. 68:19. These include a gift of healing from the Angel of Death, who teaches him how to heal the plague in Num. 17:11-13.29 The chain of tradition from 3 Enoch is not alone in connecting this midrashic tradition with the secrets contained in the text itself. In a related story of Moses' ascent published by A. Jellinek as Malayan Hokhmah,30 the angels passed on their secrets in the following way: And every one of them handed to him a spell31 for healing and a secret of names, the use of which derive from each and every verse, for thus it states, \"You went up to the heights, you took captives; you took gifts for humanity\" [Ps. 68:19], And even the Angel of Death handed a spell to him, for thus it is written, \"He put on the incense and made expiation for the people; [he stood between the dead and the living and the plague was checked\"] [Num. 17:11-13]. This is the honored [magical] procedure [shimmush] that the angels handed down through Yefefiyah, the Prince of Torah, and through Metatron, Prince of the Presence and handed it down to Moses, to Eleazar, and Eleazar to Phinehas, his son, who is Elijah, the great and dear priest, remembered for good.

This method of employing legends concerning the trans­mission of esoteric tradition is characteristic of introductions to magical books.34 The 3 Enoch chain and the introduction to Sbimmushe Tomh are thus two examples of how the theme of Moses' reception of Torah and its subsequent transmission serves purposes that go beyond the process of study and law. That tradition is marshaled for the practical purposes of healing and magical practice. SHI'UR QOMAH Related to the 3 Enoch chain in complex ways is a passage found with Shi'ur Qomah materials in several manuscripts of Hekhalot literature. The passage appears in a collection of archangel traditions extending from §§730-§39 in MSS. Oxf. 1531 and M40, §§393-402 in MS. NY 8128, and §§470-79 in MS. M22.35 Principally these concern a chief angel who is designated with the title \"youth,\"36 and identified as Metatron. The section begins at §730 with a lengthy magical prayer for recitation of divine names, in which the practitioner entreats that the demons (mazi-holism, 38; Idel, Kabbalah: New Perspectives, 396 n. 75. See, for example MS. NY JTSA 8120, fols. 6a-19a. The story was also printed in Talqut Reuveni; see Halperin, Faces of the Chariot, 291; cf. also Jellinek, Bet ha-Midrash, l:xviii. 33 On such techniques see Idel, \" Tefisat ha-Torah.\" 34 Note too that this passage also contains a brief chain of tradition, but that unlike those of the rabbinic and Hekhalot literatures, this is a priestly chain. On the priesthood in Hekhalot literature, see I. Gruenwald, iiMeqoman shel Mesorot Kohaniot be-Tesiratah shel ha-Mistiqah shel ha-Merkavah ve-shel Shi'ur QomahMehqere Terushalayim be-Mahshevet Tisrael 1 (1981-82), 65-120 (Hebrew section) and idem, Apocalyptism, 125-44. 35 MS. M22's version of the text is also published in Cohen, The Shi'ur Qomah: Texts and Recensions, 198-204. In MS. NY 8128 this collection is preceded by §§375-92, another group of Metatron traditions in a similar sequence. On the parallels between the two groups, see Halperin, Faces of the Chariot, 491-94. In the other three manuscripts the collection is preceded by Seder Rabbah de-Bereshit materials (§§715-27) and introduced by two testi­monies regarding the recitation of the Shi'ur Qomah (§§728 and 729). It is likely that the redactor of the first sequence in MS. NY 8128 created it by supplementing these two intro­ductory paragraphs with other Shi'ur Qpmah/Mctitron traditions. On the tendency to ex­pansion in MS. NY 8128, see Swartz, Mystical Prayer, 43-44. The translation provided below is based on MS. Oxf. 1531, supplemented principally by MS. M22.

This is followed by a long list of divine names and numinous descriptions of God. The descrip­tion of the \"youth\" begins at §733. There it is stated that the angel was \"given37 not to Adam, nor to Shem, nor to Abraham, nor to Isaac, nor to Jacob, but to Moses alone.\"38 This passage constitutes what can be called a negative chain of tradition, in which the figures who will not receive the secret are enumerated. The implications of this form are examined below. In §734, this angel is identified as Yofiel,39 also known as Yehariel,40 also known as Metatron. A mysterious name follows, which is said in an Aramaic gloss to have been spelled out on the Divine crown.41 The pas­sage continues: This is His great name, which was handed down to Moses at Sinai by God, faithful and humble,42 and from the mouth of Moses it was handed down to Joshua, and from Joshua to the Elders, and from the Elders to the prophets, and from the prophets to the Men of the Great Assembly and from the Men of the Great Assembly to Ezra and from Ezra to Hillel and from Hillel it was concealed until R. Abbahu came along and said, \"This is My name forever\" (Exod. 3:15). Here, as in the 3 Enoch chain, divine names, which are identified also as angelic names, are described as having been handed down at Sinai, through the chain of tradition. Here Metatron is not represented as the transformed Enoch who imparts secrets to Moses, but as the archangel whose name is like his Master's.43 To learn his names, therefore, is to learn the names of God. R. Abbahu's utterance of Exod. 3:15 constitutes an identification of the name that God designated as His own at Horeb with the divine names in our text. This passage, however, unlike the others, contains no explicit clause telling the purpose of this name.44 37 That is, permission was given to make use of his name. See Cohen, The Shi'ur Qomah, 236. 38 On this passage see Cohen, The Shi'ur Qomah, 236-37. As Cohen points out, the idea that the name was not given to the patriarchs is based on Exod. 3:13 and 6:3. 39 MS. M22 reads yzby'l, probably a corruption of Yofiel. 40 MS. M40: yhdry'l. MS. M22: yhdy'l. MS. Oxf. 1531: d'l tg'mprs. MS. M22: m'l. 42 These adjectives probably refer to Moses. Cf. Num. 12:3, 7. 43 B. Sanh. 38b, 3 Enoch §5; see Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism, 41. For the use of this idea in an amulet, see TS Kl. 168, in Schiffman and Swartz, Incantation Texts, 147, 157. Cf. also Gruenwald, iiQetaHm,\" in which a portion of God's name is given to the angel. 44 The name includes the word Irp't, which Halperin, Faces of the Chariot, 425, takes to be an echo of the tradition discussed above that Moses received magical names for healing at Sinai."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"TRADITION AND AUTHORITY 183 The chain is identical to the 3 Enoch chain until Hillel. At that point it is stated that the secret was hidden until R. Abbahu came along. This inter­esting detail may arise from a chronological problem. Several generations separated the first-century Hillel from Rabbi Abbahu of the third-fourth century. This gap is not noted in the 3 Enoch chain, but in this passage it is explained by the statement that the name was hidden away for the latter. As we shall see, this idea plays a role in the text's affirmation of its validity and power. Following this passage, the text continues with an elaborate account of Metatron's exaltation before God. It should be noted that the preceding paragraph, §733, which contains the \"negative chain of tradition,\" and §736, which follows shortly after, appear together in what is known as the Sefer ha-Qomah recension of the Shi'ur Qomah,45 as §960 and §961, but without §§734-35, which contains our chain of tradition. Although these Metatron traditions are particularly prone to shifting, this placement raises the possibility that §§734-35 was inserted into a previously existing unit that consisted of §733 and §736. If this is so, a redactor would have ap­pended §734 to §733 because of its affinities with the \"negative chain\" in that paragraph. Its purpose would be to account for how, if it was only given to Moses, the tradition eventually arrived at the hands of its more recent tradents. MEKKAVAH RA BBAH AND MA'ASEH MERKAVAH As we have seen, a chain of tradition appears in the opening hymn in Merkavah Rabbah and, in shorter form, in Ma'aseh Merkavah.46 In Mer-kavah Rabbah the passage follows the story of Rabbi Akiba's ascent found in HekhalotZutarti (§§673-74=346-47) and precedes a Merkavah Rab-bah\\ version of the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah. This hymn, which is translated above in Chapter 4, is introduced at §675 by Rabbi Ishmael's testimony concerning the benefits of \"reciting this mystery\" (raz). He will, among other things, possess this world and the world to come and receive the face of the Divine Presence. The \"mys­tery\" consists of instructions to recite the hymn with all one's heart and to guard against all sin, so that God will be with one at all times. The hymn praises the enthroned God who dwells in the exalted Hekhal as the revealer of secrets. The chain, which adds the Hasidim and the Fearers of the Name,47 proclaims that the mysteries are revealed to all Israel so that they can \"engage in Torah with them, and increase study 45 On this recension see Cohen, Shi'ur Qomah: Texts and Recensions, 6-10. 46 On the relationship of these two sources see the discussion in Chapter 4 and the studies cited there. 47 See the previous note."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"184 CHAPTER 7 [talmud] with them.\" In Ma'aseh MerkiivciFs abbreviated version, the hymn serves the purpose of introducing Ma'aseh Merkavah as a composite text that encompasses the themes of ascent and acquisition of Torah.48 There the same basic components appear as in Merkavah Kabbah, but without the elaborate chain: God revealed the secrets to Moses and he revealed them directly to Israel. In neither version is the pericope containing the hymn an integral part of a larger text. In Merkavah Rabbah, §675 follows a unit found in Hekha-Iot Zutarti, to which it bears no thematic relationship. It precedes the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah, but is not a part of that composition. In Macaseh Merkavah the passage containing the hymn was added later to serve as an introduction to that text. However, this hymn, in both versions, is directly related to the function of the Sar-Torah practices that it introduces. Mysteries, consisting of ritual procedures and divine names, are revealed through the tradition so that anyone can gain the prodigious skill in memorization and learning that the angel of the Torah provides. Moses, then, not only revealed the Torah itself, but the magical means to learn it. The scholastic succession in the chain of tradition thus takes on a particular relevance in this case. The sages' success in transmitting Torah can be ascribed to these esoteric prac­tices. Moreover, the same practices are available to all Israel—directly, as in Ma'aseh Merkavah, or in Merkavah Rabbah, through the chain of tradition. Because of its function as representing the transmission of the magic of the Sar-Torah, these texts come closest to integrating the function of the classical chain of tradition with the magical version of the same. In our previous examples, magical secrets are plainly grafted onto the myth of revelation of Torah at Sinai; that is, they say that while Moses was on the mountain, he also received curative magic. In the Sar-Torah version of the chain of tradition, Moses and his successors receive magic in the service of the Torah they impart. SUMMARY In the following table the components of these chains of tradition are compared with those of the opening chapters of Avot and Avot de-Rabbi Natan.49 48 It is possible, as Schafer suggests (Ubersetung 3:xxxi), that the first and final paragraphs of Ma'aseh Merkavah (§§544 and 596) serve as \"redaktionelle Klammer\" added by a later redactor. 49 For our purposes, when the Avot and Avot de-Rabbi Natan chains are considered together they will be referred to as the \"Avot tradition.\""},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"TRADITION AND AUTHORITY 185 Moses Joshua Elders TXBLE 3 Chains of Tradition 'Avot Hekhalot M.Avot ARNA ARNB §675 (MR) §734 (SQ) Moses Joshua Elders Prophets Prophets — HZ&M GA (...)

The Judges appear in both recensions of Avot de-Rabbi Natan but not in the Hekhalot chains. This is an indication that the latter traditions are based on Avot or its source and not Avot de-Rabbi Natan. Nor are the Pairs (zugot) of early authorities significant in the Hekhalot texts.50 The last sage from the Avot tradition to appear in the Hekhalot chains is Hillel. Shammai, the Patri­archs, and the students of Yohanan ben Zakkai are absent.51 Conversely, 50 It is possible, however, that the pairing of Zeira with Abbahu in 3 Enoch is an echo of this tendency; in the same way, perhaps, Rabbis Akiba and Ishmael are often paired together in Hekhalot literature. 51 Indeed, Yohanan ben Zakkai seldom appears in Hekhalot literature despite the depic­tion of him as an adept interpreter of the Merkavah in t. Hag. 2:1-2. Note too that Rabbis Akiba and Ishmael are also missing here. In fact, the one \"chain of tradition\" in rabbinic literature that could be construed mystically produces only a faint echo in Hekhalot litera­ture, if at all. A statement appears in t. Hag. 2:2 concerning Merkavah exegesis that \"Rabbi Joshua lectured before R. Yohanan ben Zakkai, Rabbi Akiba lectured before Rabbi Joshua, Haninah ben Hakhinai lectured before Rabbi Akiba.\" A fragmentary Genizah text (Schafer, Geniza-Fragmente, G21 [TS K21.95A], fol. lb, lines 10-12) reads: \"Rabbi Eliezer expounds"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"186 CHAPTER 7 the Amoraim Abbahu and Zeira do not appear in the Avot tradition. The Hekhalot chains also add groups unknown to rabbinic historiography. These are discussed below. THE HISTORICAL DIMENSION Although the primary focus of this discussion is on the function of this motif in the rhetoric and phenomenology of these texts, it is useful to comment on some of the more immediate historical implications of these passages. It is unlikely that their details will provide us with reliable direct evidence of the origins and identity of the early Jewish mystics. However, they do raise some interesting historiographic questions. These passages contain obvious anachronisms and chronological gaps. Ezra is placed after the Men of the Great Assembly in contrast to the rabbinic tradition.52 The interval mentioned above between Hillel and Abbahu is a difficulty that may have been addressed by the author of the Shi 'ur Qomah chain. However, Hekhalot texts often contain anachronisms far more serious than this. In the narrative of Hekhalot Rabbati rabbis appear together who were hardly contemporaries.53 It is possible that this tendency is a product of a certain kind of mystical consciousness, as Joseph Dan suggests.54 However, it may reflect a lack of access on the part of the authors to more reliable chronological sources.55 In any case, it is clear [doresh] the Merkavah, Rabbi Akiba searches \\mefallesh\\ the Merkav[ah, Haninah ben] Hakhinai reports [mesapper] the Merkavah,\" and so on. On the Tosefta passage see Halperin, Merkabah in Rabbinie Literature, 84-86. 52 Much has been written about the Great Assembly (or Great Synagogue); it has been debated whether it constituted an actual institution. Sources and bibliography on the Great Assembly are analyzed in Ira Jeffery Schiffer, \"The Men of the Great Assembly,\" in Persons and Institutions in Early Rabbinic Judaism, ed. William S. Green (Missoula, Mont.: Scholars Press, 1977), 237-76; see the literature cited there; cf. H. Mantel, Anshe Kenneset ha-Gedolah (Tel Aviv: Dvir, 1983). 53 See Joseph Dan, iiTefisat ha-Historiah be-Sifrut ha-Hekhalot ve-ha-Merkavah,\" in Be-'Orah Madac: Mehqarim be-Tarbut Tisra'elMugashim le-'Aharon Mirsky, ed. Zvi Malachi (Lod: Makhon Haberman, 1986), 117-29, translated and adapted as \"The Concept of His­tory in Hekhalot and Merkabah Literature,\" in Binah: Studies in Jewish History, Thought, and Culture, ed. J. Dan (New York: Praeger, 1988), 1: 47-57. Justas striking is the presence of Rabbi Ishmael, designated \"high priest,\" in the Temple according to that story. See Dan, iiTefisat ha-Historiah,\" 123; cf. b. Ber. 7a, on which see Scholem, Major Trends, 356 n. 3. 54 Dan, Tefisat ha-Historiah. 55 Dan's assertion (Tefisat ha-Historiah) that the authors must have been aware of the subtleties of rabbinic chronology and chose to ignore them is based largely on Scholem's argument (Gnosticism, 9-13) for the halakhic character of the story of Rabbi Nehuniah's removal from heaven in Hekhalot Rabbati §§221-24; cf. Schiffman, \"Recall of Rabbi Nehunia,\" and S. Lieberman in Gruenwald, Apocalyptic, 241-44.

Cf."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"TRADITION AND AUTHORITY 187 that the interest of the authors is not historiographic. More important to them is the need to provide supernatural origins and hallowed precedents for their magic. To this end, groups of spiritual ancestors play an important part in these chains. The Elders, Prophets, and the Men of the Great Assembly appear in all of them, as they do in Avot and Avot de-Rabbi Natan. The Merka-vah Rabbab chain also includes hasidim, who are mentioned in rabbinic sources but not in the rabbinic chains. Also notable is the presence of other mysterious groups in two of the chains: Men of Faith, ('anshe 'amanah), Possessors of Faith (ba'ale 'emunah), and Fearers of the Name (yir'e ha-shem). The term hasidim can have several meanings in rabbinic literature. It is unclear whether it refers to a clearly defined group or sect. It can refer to a group of saints who observed moral law to an extraordinary level, a type of wonder-worker with miraculous powers, or simply a particular type of reli­gious personality distinguished by exceptional piety.56 The term 'anshe 'amanah appears in m. Sotah 9:12 as one of a series of things and persons that ceased when the Temple was destroyed.57 In y. Sotah 9:14 (24b) the latter are identified as those who occupy themselves with the study of Torah at the expense of business pursuits. In b. Sotah 48b the Gemara ex­plains the term as referring to those pious ones who do not ask where their next meal will come from. These sources are notable because they appear among enumerations of the extraordinary phenomena and pious men that characterized the periods of the First and Second Temples. These consti­tute, if not a miraculous chain, then a series that extends down through history to the rabbinic period.58 The inclusion of the category 'anshe ',a-manah in these texts may have inspired the authors of the Hekhalot chains to include this term in constructing their list of precursors. Margarete Schliiter's observation that the ritual in the story is extrahalakhic: \"Erzahlung,\" 108, and chapter 6 above. 56 On the term hasid see Louis Jacobs, \"The Concept of Hasid in the Biblical and Rab­binic Literatures,\" JJS 8 (1957): 143-54. The relationship between the term hasidim in rabbinic literature and the group of that name depicted in the books of Maccabees (1 Macc. 2:42, 7:13; 2 Macc. 14:6) as participants in the revolt is uncertain, as is their identification with the Essenes. For a survey of the sources and an analysis of the problem see S. Safrai, \"The Teaching of Pietists in Mishnaic Literature,\" JJS 16 (1965): 15-33. 57 The prooftext given is Ps. 12:2, \"Help, O YHWH, for the pious [hasid] are no more; the faithful ['emunim] have vanished from among human beings.\" 58 See especially t. Sotah 15, enumerating the traits of rabbis: \"When ben Azzai died, the conscientious ceased; when ben Zoma died, interpreters ceased,\" etc.; and b. Sotah 48b, in which the prophets and sages who made use of the heavenly voice (bat qol) are listed. In b. Sotah 47b this motif is in fact transformed into a \"catastrophic sorite\" in a narration of the stages of deterioration of Second Temple society. Cf. Fischel, \"Sorites,\" 129-32."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"188 CHAPTER 7 The term ba'ale 'emunah appears among synonyms for groups of mys­tics in a hymn in Hekhalot Rabbati. The structure of the hymn links a divine attribute with the group praising God and their act of praise: You are faithful [ne'eman] in your word; All possessors of faith [ ba'ale 'emunah] trust [ma'aminim\\ in you.59 The hymn includes a similar stanza employing the term hasid. The term ba'ale emunah thus refers there not to a specific historical group, but to classes of worshippers called up for the purposes of the hymn's structure.60 Moreover, qualities such as faithfulness and piety are often mentioned as prerequisites for the Merkavah or Sar-Torah praxis. In a text such as ours, which places importance on tradition and historical antecedents for its claims to effectiveness, such designations could easily be imagined as refer­ring to definite historical groups who transmitted the tradition. Thus it is likely that these terms refer either to the mystics themselves, or, perhaps, mythic ancestors patterned after Elders and the Men of the Great Assem­bly and influenced by the appearance of terms such as 'anshe 'amanah in talmudic literature. The inclusion of such groups would serve to empha­size that the tradition could only be carried on by men known for piety and holiness.61 The inclusion of Rabbi Abbahu and his colleague Zeira in the 3 Enoch and Shi'ur Qomah chains is puzzling. Abbahu is known in talmudic tradi­tion as an important economic and political figure in Palestine, particularly in Caesarea. He was also known for philosophical and exegetical disputa­tions with heretics and non-Jewish thinkers.62 However, he does not fig­ure prominently in Hekhalot literature. This leads Halperin to suggest a Caesarean provenance for this tradition.63 Salo Baron, commenting on the 59 On this hymn and its structure see J. Maier, \"'Attah Ηύ' 'Adon (Hekhalot rabbati XXVI, $),\" Judaica 21 (1965): 129-33. 60 Cf. the other examples of such epithets cited m Alexander, \"3 Enoch,\" 315, n. w. 61 On such prerequisites, see Uchelen, \"Ethical Terminology.\" There may seem to be a contradiction between the requirement that the practitioner be morally blameless and the instrumentality of the name or praxis (see below), by which it functions independently of the moral status of the practitioner. This question is addressed in Hekhalot Rabbati §201, in which Rabbi Ishmael expresses despair at the possibility of achieving such a moral level upon hearing Rabbi Nehuniah's enumeration of those requirements; the latter answers by showing him the technique which is effective for anyone. See further below on esotericism and exoter-icism in these literatures. 62 See especially Lee I. Levine, \"Rabbi Abbahu of Caesarea,\" in Christianity, Judaism, and Other Greco-Roman Cults: Studiesfor Morton Smith at Sixty, ed. Jacob Neusner (Leiden: Brill, 1975), 4:56-76; and idem, Caesarea under Roman Rule (Leiden: Brill, 1975), 75-78. In Gen. R. 6:6 a cosmological tradition regarding the dimension of the second firmament is taught in his name.

But bowls refer enigmati­cally to another rabbi, Joshua ben Perahia, in a similar way.65 It is possible that inclusion of Rabbi Abbahu reflects some lost legend that traveled, say, to Babylonia from Palestine. Variations and Their Implications When we compare the versions of the chain of tradition within the Hekha-Iot corpus itself, we can see interesting differences, corresponding to cer­tain features of the texts into which they are set. As noted above, the Merkavah Rabbah and Ma'aseh Merkavah versions emphasize the value of the secrets revealed from Moses to Israel for the magical acquisition of Torah. This is consistent with both texts. In Merkavah Rabbah adjurations of the Sar-Torah and the Sar ha-Panim figure prominently. The redaction of Ma'aseh Merkavah combines ascent and Sar-Torah sections. These two chains of tradition do not mention named rabbinic authorities. In the Ma'aseh Merkavah version the secrets are transferred directly from Moses to Israel; in Merkavah Rabbah the precursors to the rabbis are listed but no rabbis themselves. This is notable in light of the implications of the Sar-Torah tradition: that the learning of the rabbis can be acquired though magical means. By contrast, the 3 Enoch and Shi'ur Qomah traditions are more specific in listing individual rabbinic authorities: Shi'ur Qomah includes Hillel, one of the acknowledged founders of rabbinic Judaism, and R. Abbahu; and 3 Enoch extends this to Zeira. In the case of 3 Enoch, this is in keeping with a tendency of that text. 3 Enoch incorporates many disparate ele­ments, encompassing apocalyptic, pietistic, and cosmological strands. Moreover, 3 Enoch displays affinities to late rabbinic terminology and thought not characteristic of most other Hekhalot texts.66 Thus its rab-binizing tendency is reflected in the greater detail of its chain of tradition. So too, the Shi'ur Qomah, while not as traditional in theological concep-64 Salo W.

The \"chain of tradition\" motif is a literary topos which seems to appear inde­pendent of any given immediate narrative or liturgical context. It can ap­pear in a cosmological text, instruction for an incantation, magical book, or hymn. As described above, the chain of tradition in Avot is interspersed with the sayings of individual sages, thus signifying that the Torah they transmit is a process carried on actively by these persons. In contrast, no such elab­oration of the list of names can occur in our traditions because the tradents cannot add to the divine name or praxis. It must be recited or performed exactly as handed down to Moses by God or Metatron. The charisma of the tradition is thus not invested in the individuals who pass it on and honor it with their wisdom and acuity, but in a potent name, act, or book. The degree of contrast varies between texts within the corpora; for exam­ple, there is a greater emphasis on the role of the rabbis in the 3 Enoch and Shi'ur Qomah versions. Nevertheless, what is significant to the chains of tradition in Hekhalot literature is that while they use the rabbinic chain of tradition as a model, 197two essential differences occur: (1) the magical name, praxis, or text is substituted for the process of Torah; and (2) the chain culminates not in the succession of latter-day rabbis down to the present day, but in the conclusion that these names and secrets are available to \"all Israel\" (Mer-kavah Rabbah) or at least, as in 3 Enoch, to the faithful practitioners who will use it for Israel's benefit. VALIDATION IN MAGICAL BOOKS These two essential features of the Hekhalot chains of tradition are also characteristic of Jewish magical texts. The emphasis on the potent divine name is one of the most prominent features of Jewish magic. Magical texts also claim to be effective for anyone who uses them regardless of social status. These affinities are made strikingly manifest in patterns of valida­tion in magical texts, in which similar motifs serve to recommend the rituals and esoteric names contained in them. These patterns are found principally in introductions to magical books and represent interesting 67 See Cohen, Shi'ur Qpmahi 86-87."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"TRADITION AND AUTHORITY 191 variations of the motifs described above. Examining how they are used in magical texts will help us understand how the dynamics of ritual power and esotericism operate in these two literatures, and tell us something about the affinities between them. These distinctive features, moreover, are most evident in passages con­cerning the transmission not only of a powerful name, but of a specific book. As the book functions not only as a repository of wisdom or revela­tion, but as a physical object, it is particularly emblematic of the tensions described here. Investigation of this theme will then lead to a consider­ation of the role of the book in the Hekhalot and magical traditions. The Magical Chain of Tradition Another type of chain of tradition occurs in the introductions to magical books found in the Genizah and other collections. Introductions to magi­cal texts are among the most common features of such handbooks and constitute a distinct genre. At least two such introductions were published independently by Jellinek as \"minor midrashim\": Malayan Hokhmah, cited above, and the so-called Sefer Noah described below.68 The most prominent of these introductions appears in Sefer ha-Razim, an early handbook of magic pieced together from Genizah fragments and other medieval manuscripts by M. Margalioth.69 Although the extent to which Sefer ha-Razim is a unitary work is open to question,70 its introduc­tion is a good example of this form and goes back at least to the early Middle Ages.71 It was printed in the popular medieval anthology Sefer Raziel and is related to a series of stories that appear elsewhere in that compilation. The introduction to Sefer ha-Razim begins as follows: \"This is one of the books of the mysteries that was given to Noah son of Lamech son of 68 For examples of the relationship between midrash and magical texts, see below.

Sefer ha-Razim was dated by Margalioth to the third century; Gruenwald (Apocalyptic, 226) suggests a sixth-century date for the work."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"192 CHAPTER 7 Methuselah son of Enoch son of Jared son of Mehalalel son of Kenan son of Enosh son of Seth son of Adam, by the angel Raziel in the year when he came to the ark before he entered.\"72 The text goes on to relate how the book was written with a sapphire and how Noah used the book to perform wonders, to know astrology and healing, and to fashion the ark out of gopher wood and to get the animals into it. When Noah died, \"he gave it to Abraham and from Abraham to Isaac and from Isaac to Jacob and from Jacob to Levi and from Levi to Kohath and from Kohath to Amram and from Amram to Moses and from Moses to Joshua and from Joshua to the Elders and from the Elders to the Prophets and from the Prophets to the Sages and so to every generation undl Solomon arose to be enlightened by many books of wisdom . . . for many books were handed down to him, but he found this most precious and honored and enduring [ qasheh] of all.\"73 The text goes on to praise itself extravagantly. Unlike the chains of tradi­tion in Hekhalot literature, Sefer ha-Razim's does not begin with Moses, but with Noah.74 Noah's lineage is traced back to Adam, and the magical tradition is carried forward through Noah's descendants to Moses.75 Nor does the chain mention individual rabbis or their Second Temple pre­cursors such as the Men of the Great Assembly. It culminates in Solo­mon, who was well known as a master of magical and occult wisdom in antiquity.76 Solomon is placed in an odd position after prophets and sages. This anachronism may have its origin in redactional considerations. It is pos­sible that the editor of the introduction had two traditions regarding the origin and authority of the book: the Solomon stories and the chain of tradition. In order to accommodate them both, he then structured the introduction so that the chain ended not with the Sages, but with Solomon.77 Noah is represented in a variety of sources as a recipient of angelic heal-72 Margalioth, Sefer ha-Razim, 65. 73 Ibid., 66. 74 Cf. below on the version of this tradition that begins with Adam. 75 On the genealogical list as a chain of tradition see Fischel, \"Sorites,\" 128-29. 76 On magical Solomon traditions see D.

The earliest extant is Jubilees 10:10-14, in which the angels teach the secrets of healing to Noah, who writes it down in a book he gives to Shem.78 A more elaborate version of this story appears in the introduc­tion to the medical book of Asaph the Physician (Sefer Refu'ah le-'Asafha-Rofe').79 The extent to which this work is a cohesive composition is open to question, as well as its dating. Most recently a Byzantine provenance has been argued for the book.80 The introduction was printed in A. Jellinek's Bet ha-Midrash as Sefer Noah.81 There the book is presented as the \"Book of Remedies that the early sages copied from the Book of Shem, son of Noah.\" The text continues with a tale of how, seeing that diseases were 78 See the translation and notes of James C. Vanderkam, The Book of Jubilees (Louvain: E. Peeters, 1989), 59-60; on the \"Hebrew Book of Noah\" cited there see below. There is substantial evidence for rabbinic and early medieval acquaintance for Jubilees and details found in it. See Martha Himmelfarb, \"R. Moses the Preacher and the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs,\" AJS Review 9 (1984): 55-78. However, Jubilees need not have been the immediate source for all of the later traditions described below. On the parallels to this introduction see also Gruenwald, Apocalyptic, 227'. 79 The most recent and judicious discussion of Sefer ha-Refu'ot Ie-'Asaph ha-Rofe' can be found in Elinor Lieber, \" AsaPs Book of Medicines: A Hebrew Encyclopedia of Greek and Jewish Medicine, Possibly Compiled in Byzantium on an Indian Model,\" in Symposium on Byzantine Medicine, Dumbarton Oaks Papers 38, ed. John Scarborough (Washington, D.C.: Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection, 1984), 233-49. This unusual work has had a curious history in Jewish scholarship. It has never been published in full, but several scholars have made studies of it: Ludwig Venetianer, Asaf Judaeus: Der Aelsteste Medi-cizinische Schriftsteller in Hebraeischer Sprache, Jahresbericht der Lands-Rabbinerschule in Budapest 38-40 (Budapest, 1915); Suessman Muntner, Mavo' Ie-Sefer 'Asaf ha-Rofe' (Jeru­salem: Genizah, 1967); Aviv Melzer, \"Asaph the Physician—the Man and his Book: A Historical-Philological Study of the Medical Treatise, The Book of Drugs\" (Ph.D. diss., University ofWisconsin, 1972). In his thesis, Melzer published much of a major manuscript of the text. Lieber states (\"Asaf's Book of Medicines237) that she is preparing a critical edition, translation, and commentary of the work. With renewed interest in Hebrew litera­ture outside of the rabbinic canon, this text merits attention by historians. 80 Lieber, \"Asaf's Book of Medicines.\" Muntner argued for a seventh-century dating; see Siissmann Muntner, \"The Antiquity of Asaph of the Physician and His Editorship of the EarliestHebrewBookofMedicine,\" Bulletin of the History of Medicine 25 (1951), 101-31, for a summary of his arguments.

Melzer's argument for a third-century Babylonian dating has rightly been rejected by Lieber. While earlier scholars considered the work to be pseudepigra-phic, Venetianer, Muntner, and Melzer argued that Asaph and his colleague \"Yohanan son of Zabda ha-Yarhoni\" were in fact the authors of the book, as claimed in the introduction. However, this view is unlikely; see Pines, \"Oath,\" 251, and especially Lieber, \"Asaf's Book of Medicines,\" 237-49. It is still uncertain why the otherwise unknown Asaph was designated as the author. 81 Jellinek, Bet ha-Midrash, 1:155-56, from MS. Munich Staatsbibliothek 231.

In response, God sent Raphael, one of the Angels of the Presence, to teach Noah the secrets of extracting cures from plants.82 Noah wrote these techniques down and gave the book to Shem, who passed it on to the sages of the world. Here the text tells of a remarkably wide process of transmission: \"The knowl­edge of medicine increased in the earth among all the nations who studied medical books: among the sages of India, the sages of Macedonia, the sages of Egypt. . . . And their knowledge increased until a certain As-clepius83 arose, from the sages of Macedonia.\" The text goes on to relate how Asclepius and forty wizards (hartumim) schooled in the medical books attempted to steal the medicinal trees from Paradise, but were repulsed by the flaming sword. As a consequence of this hubris, medical wisdom was lost until the days of King Artahashta (Artax-erxes): \"In his days there arose a discerning and wise man learned in the knowledge of medical books and understanding of every matter, and his name was Hippocrates the Macedonian.\"84 Thus, in this account, all books of medicine in the world derive from one book, the Book of Shem, which the reader now holds.85 Several features in this introduction recall the introductions to magical books and chains of tradition under study here. The story of the sages who attempted to steal the Tree of Life provides an etiology for the idea dis­cussed above in the esoteric chains of tradition that the secret was hidden away until a certain sage, presumably the more proximate founder of the tradition, recovered it. An interesting variation on the motif in this case is its international nature. The originator of the tradition was Noah, the fa­ther of all nations (although it was written down by Shem), and it was recovered not by a Jewish sage, but a Greek. From Hippocrates, however, it finally fell into the hands of \"Asaph the Jew.\" The similarities of this text to the introduction to Sefer ha-Razim go beyond this use of the figure of Noah. Sefer ha-Razim also follows a similar pattern with regard to the fate of the angelic book.86 It was handed down by an angel to the primordial hero, used to great practical benefit in a 82 Obviously, the selection of Raphael for this role is due to his name, derived from the root rp'.

However, its affinity with magical books should also be taken into account, despite the notable absence of magical elements in the main recensions of the text."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"TRADITION AND AUTHORITY 195 remote \"age of miracles,\" and was hidden away until its discovery by the sage. In these examples the chain of tradition has been applied here not just to a set of secrets or magical names, but to a specific book—the very book the reader now has in his hands. This idea is part of a larger pattern in which history and tradition are placed at the disposal of the individual magician or mystic. Moreover, the text's extension of this motif to the book itself is significant in light of the widespread idea that a physical book can function as a powerful object. A similar tradition found in later magical books such as Sefer Raziel, as well as the Zohar, begins the esoteric tradition with Adam and hints at an exegetical grounding for the idea of the book handed down by God to the first man.87 These traditions are based on Gen 5:1. The clause zeh sefer toledot Adam is taken by some midrashim to mean, \"This is the book of generations, [which belongs] to Adam,\" and to refer to a book in which the fate of all souls yet to be born is written.88 In some talmudic sources, a contrary view of this verse is taken: \"Rabbi Levi said: What is the meaning of the verse, 'This is the book of the generations of Adam?' Did the first man have a book? [Rather,] it teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He showed the first man each generation and its interpreters.\"89 This state­ment could well be a polemic against the idea that an actual book was given to Adam. Compare the following from Gen. R 24:7: \"R Tanhuma said in the name of R Menahem in the name of Rav: The first Adam taught all of the crafts \\'omaniot\\. What is the scriptural evidence for this? Ve-harashim hemah me-'adam [Isa. 44:11]: the artisans [harashim] re­ceived [their craft] from Adam. Our rabbis say: Adam even taught the ruler line of the book, as it is written, 'This is the book'—it and its ruler line.\"90 In the second statement, the crafts of bookmaking are included in the word sefer based on the exegesis of Isa. 44:11.91 Another exegesis of the word sefer takes the legend in a somewhat different direction, but to famil-87 Sefer Raziel (Amsterdam, 1701), fol. 2a, on which see Margalioth, Sefer ha-Razim, xii; cf. Zohar l:37a-b, 55b and 58b. On these tales see Ginzberg, Legends 1:90-93 and 5:117-18 n. 110. 88 See especially Gen. R. ch. 24:3-4. In Gen. R. 24:5 \"the book of the generations\" is the Torah itself, which would have been given to Adam had he not disobeyed the few command­ments given to him. The Noah story in Genesis also begins 'eleh toledot Noah. It is possible that the analogy to these legends influenced the image of Noah as a recipient of esoteric books. Cf. a similar analogy based on the word toledot drawn in Zohar 1:55b, on which see Daniel C. Matt, Zohar: The Book of Enlightenment (New York: Paulist Press, 1983), 216-17. 89 B. Abod. Zar. 5a; cf. b. Sanh. 38b. 90 See the variants in Theodor-Albeck, Bereshit Rabbah, 1:236. 91 See n. above. An interesting detail is the use of the phrase ve-harashim hemah me-'adam from Isa. 44:11. As the term harash also can refer to sorcery, it is possible that some esoteric exegete could have taken it to mean that magicians (harashim) learned their craft from Adam (me-'Adam)."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"196 CHAPTER 7 iar effect. In Pirqe de-Rabbi 'Eliezer chapter 8, sefer is related to the verb spr, \"to count,\" and taken to refer to the secrets of calculating the calen­dar.92 God thus gave the reckoning (spr) of the calendar to the generations of Adam (toledot 'Adam). He passed it down (msr) to Noah, to Shem, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and to Joseph and his brothers. When Joseph died, the secret died too—so too it will diminish in our days until Elijah comes. Here we can recognize the motif of the esoteric chain of tradition, and so too the \"negative\" form of the motif, asserting that the esoteric tradition was hidden away until the proper time and individual figure comes along. The Magical Book and the Uses of History Introductions to magical books attest not only that the book has been passed down through history by ideal figures, but has served an active role in that history. This feature of these introductions provides examples of an interesting interplay between midrash and magic. In one manuscript of Hekhalot Zutarti,93 the text, which contains cos-mological and Merkavah traditions, is introduced (§341) as \"the book of wisdom and understanding, . . . the treasures of Torah and heaven and earth,\" which was given to Moses at Horeb. Here the passage echoes a common motif, quite reasonably based on Exod. 3:15: When God pro­claimed \"this is My name forever,\" he was referring to the name presented in our text.94 The notable addition, which also appears in magical hand­books, is that \"with it Moses performed the signs and wonders which he performed in Egypt, and by it he smote the Egyptian.\" The text alludes here to a legend found in midrash that Moses slew the Egyptian by means of a divine name.95 Unlike the midrashim, however, our passage presents that same name and makes it available to the reader.96 92 That is, the midrash probably vocalizes the word spr as safer, \"counting.\" 93 MS. NY 8128. 94 Cf. the similar use of Exod. 3:15 in the Shi'ur Qpmah chain quoted above. 95 On this legend see Lev. R. 32.4, Avot de-Rabbi Natan A chap. 20 (p. 72); Exod. R. 28.2 and 30.2, and Pirqe de-Rabbi Eliezer chap. 48; from the evidence of Avot de-Rabbi Natan A and Exod. R. 30.2 it is likely that the midrash is based on the occurrence of the verb 'omervci Exod. 2:14, which is taken to indicate that Moses spoke ('amar) the name and killed the Egyptian. See the sources listed in Avigdor Shinan, Midrash Shemot-Rabbah Parashot '-y\"d (Tel Aviv: Dvir, 1984), 89; in Ginzberg, Legends, 5:405 n. 73; and in Friedlander, Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer, 379 n. 6. Friedlander cites Clement of Alexandria's report of this legend in the name of mustai (Stromateis. i. 23); the identity of his informants is obscure. Friedlander's suggestion that this is \"probably a Jewish-Hellenistic Midrash\" is interesting in light of the exegetical rationale for the legend noted above, which is rooted in the Hebrew. See further Jarl E. Fossum, The Name of God and the Angel of the Lord (Tubingen: Mohr, 1985), 118-19. 96 See also below on the use of a talmudic Joseph legend in an amulet. There would seem to be a chronological problem for our text, as it identifies the name God revealed at Horeb to Moses with the one Moses used to slay the Egyptian: The latter event occurred (Exod. 2:12)"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"TRADITION AND AUTHORITY 197 The utility of such a name is made explicit in a fragment of a magical book from the Genizah, which contains, among other things, an incanta­tion \"for one who is unsuccessful in business.\" The text introduces an elaborate divine name in this way: κ-πιπη nu/π πτ mmxn n\"y urn π una nwv in i:rra>6 t&iyb PiT1J ΐ3κ vby ιηικ trnsinm This is the great and awesome name that was revealed to our fathers and by which Moses our teacher, peace be upon him, performed all the signs and wonders; and anyone who would carry it on [his person] is never harmed.97 The text continues with instructions for writing the name on the skin of a deer or white sheep. It would then be worn as an amulet for personal protection. The theme of a particular person, animal, or object that has passed from one historical episode to the next also figures in midrashic folklore. This motif has been charted by Isaac Heinemann in his classic Darkhe Ha-Aeyjadah.98 In one example, the garments that were made for Adam and Eve, which had the power to attract animals to anyone who wore them, were obtained by Nimrod, and then by Esau (thus explaining the success of both as hunters). Rebecca finally gave them to Jacob, and he buried them.\" In another tradition, the staff that was created at the Sabbath eve at twilight according to m. Avot 5:6 was used by Jacob to cross the Jordan; Jacob then gave it to Judah and Tamar, the ancestors of the Messiah; it was then used by Moses and Aaron to perform their miracles, and so on. It now lies buried only to be handed to the Messiah when he comes.100 In after the former (Exod. 3:15). Rachel Elior, Hekhalot Zutarti, 62, note to line 28, suggests reading berev for Iiorev in light of a parallel to the magical text Harba' de-Moshe, the \"Sword of Moses\" (Moses Gaster, \"The Sword of Moses,\" 3:70 and 1:313), which would eliminate this problem. That is, according to that reading, Moses slew the Egyptian with a \"sword\"—a magical name like that referred to in the Harba' de-Moshe. If this is indeed an error for such a reading, the scribe of that manuscript would have been influenced by the exegeses of Exod. 3:15 cited above. It is possible that our other sources assumed, as did PetiratMoshe (Jellinek, Bet ha-Midrash 1:121), that the name was inscribed on Moses' staff from the beginning.

For our practi­tioners, the motif serves the function of validation and recommendation of the name or book they have in their hands. The practical consequences of such myths can be seen in amulets from the Cairo Genizah. There, in contrast to the handbooks, these legends are placed at the disposal of specific, named individuals for solving their prob­lems.101 Amulets often adjure the angels by \"the name that was on Aaron's staff.\"102 A common form links the desired fate of the client with the fortune of the biblical hero. TS Kl.6 quotes Gen. 6:8 to this effect: '\"Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord' of Hosts. So may Menashe ben Shamsi find favor in the eyes of all children of Adam and Eve.\"103 Another amulet, TS Kl.168, employs a well-known talmudic story that Gabriel taught Joseph the seventy languages and added a letter of the divine name to his name.104 The amulet's innovation is to put that fact to practical use by making that name available to him and his client. This pattern is not restricted to Jewish magic. Folklorists have found widespread use of what they call the \"epic motif\" or \"historiola\" in magi­cal texts.105 Thomas Sebeok, writing on Cheremis charms, defines this as \"an introductory reference of some sort to a past deed by a beneficent power, to whom the rest of the charm is anchored.\"106 In Sebeok's exam­ple, a symbolic reference to Mt. Calvary functions to assure the client that \"human life is secure from evil attack under the protection of Christ.\"107 All of these motifs serve to bring the force of history to bear on the Agamemnon in Homer's Iliad, 2:100-109; Fischel (\"Sorites,\" 124-26) believes the Home­ric pattern to be the origin of the rabbinic chain of tradition; cf. Saldarini, Scholastic Rabbi-nism, 71. It is interesting that this motif is most fully developed in late sources such as the Talqut and Pirqe de-Rabbi Eliezer. 101 See Schiffman and Swartz, Incantation Texts, 23-24, 40-42. 102 See, for example, TS Kl.6 in ibid., 65-68, lines 3-4. 103 TS Kl .6, lines 14-16. 104 MS.

The authors have taken the charisma of a Joseph, Moses, or Hillel and objectified it. Put in the form of a name or book, it is then made available to anyone with access to it. ESOTERICISM, EXOTERICISM, AND INSTRUMENTALITY Validation of the name, book, or technique may come both from claims to its availability and from claims to its exclusiveness. To put this another way, its power can be established in claims both of esotericism and exotericism. An illustration of a peculiar esoteric claim can be seen in the motif of the \"negative chain of tradition.\" The testimony mentioned above (§733), which precedes the Shi'ur Qomah version of the chain of tradition, refers to the angel the adjuration of whom was permitted not to the antediluvian ancestors or patriarchs but to Moses alone. So too, in the following passage (§734), the name must be hidden away until Abbahu comes along.108 Amagical prayer based on the sevenfold amidah known as Sheva' de-'Eliahu or ShevacZutarti109 asserts that a certain divine name was writ­ten for Moses, and for no other prophet but Elijah.110 This motif can help us understand a paradox in Hekhalot and allied literatures. There is an apparent contradiction between the literatures' claim, on the one hand, that a given tradition was transmitted through the sages to \"all Israel\" and is therefore available to \"everyone\" who needs it; and, on the other hand, their emphasis that the text is revealing secrets, hidden things, and mysteries (setarim, kevushim, razim). This has given rise in recent years to discussion concerning whether Merkavah mysticism is esoteric or exoteric.111 In fact, claims both to esotericism and exotericism in the literature serve to emphasize an essential element of the magic: its instrumental power. The power of the tradition is manifest in the extreme caution and peculiar circumstances in which it must be used. This caution is expressed in elabo­rate ritual procedures accompanying the use of the name or book, and in the very fact that it was not given to just anybody.112 This is one reason why the praxis is so often depicted as being dangerous. It is dangerous because it is inherendy powerful. 108 Cf. also the Genizah fragment known as Hotam ha-Merkavah (on which see below) in which a divine name is reserved only for a \"certain master [ rav ] in Babylonia.\" 109 Schafer, Geniza-Fragmente, Gl 3 and G14. 110 Ibid., G14 (TS K21.95.T) fol.

This theme is emphasized in the Sar-Torah tradition by a story (§305 in Hekhalot Rabbati) in which the effectiveness of the tech­nique of conjuring the Prince of the Torah is tested in the face of doubting rabbis. Rabbi Akiba tests it on simpletons and shepherds and they become his equal in learning.113 The Book as Magical Object This tension between esotericism and exotericism also helps us understand something about the elaborate rituals prescribed in the introductions to magical books and in Sar-Torah traditions. Among the conditions for use of the magical book are ritual purity and a regimen of preparation. Much discussion on this subject has focused on whether these rituals were in­tended to engender a mystical trance.114 But their inclusion in these texts has a rhetorical function as well. The instructions for reciting the magical book in purity and sincerity serve to impress on the reader its sacred and powerful qualities.115 An obscure but interesting Aramaic text in the Hekhalot corpus for recitation of the Great Name (§§489-95) combines an elaborate preparation ritual with warnings of the dire consequences of selling the book. In this text, the book itself has an essential role in the magical ritual: the practitioner is to take it down to the river, where he should read from it.116 In this case, as in most of these passages, the divine names contained in the book are responsible for its power. But the fact that they are written down in a book is significant to the magician. The physicality of the book or text is often an important component of the process of objectification of the tradition. The frontispieces of several editions of Sefer Raziel declare that it is not even necessary to read the book, for a house that contains it will be saved from fire.117 Amulets must be worn or placed in a specific location in order to be effective.118 In such cases, the myth of an esoteric 113 On this passage see Chapter 4 and Halperin, Faces of the Chariot, 376-77. 114 See Chapter 6. 115 A good example is an introduction to a magical book in the Genizah, MS. TS Kl .21, fol. Ib lines 3-17, parallel to the introduction to Sefer ha-Malbush (printed in Sefer Raziel fol. 2b), and to Sefer ha-Razim 2:8-10; cf. 5:34-35. Cf. Margalioth, Sefer ha-Razim, 33-34.

Rather, esotericism is expressed in the transmission of the book or text itself. Oral recitation of the text is still, however, a necessary ingredient of the ritual procedure.119 In fact, several testimonies in Hekhalot literature enumerate the benefits the practitioner will derive from the oral repetition of the pericope.120 Nor does the absence of a myth of oral transmission leave our authors bereft of a concept of tradition. Indeed, such a concept can be expressed in what Edward Shils calls \"the endurance of past objects.\"121 The Heavenly Book If the book originated in heaven, its power can operate there as well. This implication of the idea of the potent book is illustrated by the Hotam ha-Merkavah Genizah fragment analyzed above, first published by Gruenwald and then by Schafer.122 This text provides interesting evidence for our consideration of the role of the sacred book in the literature. At the place where the extant text begins, the angel Ozhayah is instruct­ing the mystic in \"the study of the descent to the Merkavah\" (talmud yeridat ha-Merkavah). This includes reception of a \"seal\" and a \"path\" (netiv) that he is to write down for himself \"and for whomever wishes to descend and glimpse and see the King in His beauty\" (line 24). The angel stresses that the traveler (the narrator) is fortunate to have him at his aid, unlike those who came before who were subject to great harm. He then gives the following instructions: \"And take this path, that he may descend and see and not be harmed. For on a scroll I have placed it for you, and I have seen it, and afterwards you descended and sa[w] and tried and you were not harmed, for I have placed for you the paths of the Merkavah like light, and the courses of the firmament like the sun.\"123 This passage may be referring to the text itself. It has been dictated by the angel and placed on a scroll,124 which contains the \"seals\"—the magical names for pro-119 See Swartz, \"Scribal Magic,\" 166. 120 See for example §424, in Hekhalot Zutarti, which recommends \"reciting this Mish-nahcf. §300.

It is then made accessible to the practitioners.126 The angel proceeds to tell of the dangers of the journey, including what happened to Ben Zoma at the first Hekhal. Ozhayah further declares that the scroll is available to \"you and all who wish to descend to the Merkavah, whether in your generation or other generations.\" Halperin, in his discus­sion of this text, comments that although the descent is \"a horribly dan­gerous activity . . . if there is anything esoteric or restricted about [it], the text does not show it.\"127 In fact, both the account of the dangers and the encouragement to the reader to use the praxis are elements in the dialectic of esotericism described above. The danger plays an important role both in the rhetoric and phenomenology of the text. On the one hand, the con­stant stress that the technique must be performed correctly lends the praxis mystery and power. On the other hand, the motif of the dangers of not performing the ritual correctly reflects a genuine concern of the magi­cian. The name, book, or ritual is seen as functioning independently of the moral character and religious consciousness of the practitioner.128 If the name is valid for everyone, regardless of whether he is Moses or a humble shepherd, it must be used very carefully, as it calls up potent forces. To be sure, the myth of Moses at Sinai provides an important paradigm for this emphasis on the marvelous book from heaven. However, the idea of the heavenly book given to a hero who brings it down for use in the earthly community is a pattern that precedes the Sinai story and spreads beyond it. This has been shown by Geo Widengren in The Ascension of the Apostle and the Heavenly Book,129 based on sources ranging from an­cient Mesopotamian to Mandaic, with a stop at the Gedullat Moshe mid-rashim.130 It can be argued that both the Sinai traditions and the magical Hekhalot literature found in the Genizah are in fact written on scrolls; see Schafer, Geniza-Fragmente 9. On the writing of rabbinic literature on scrolls, see Marc Bregman, iiQeta' Qadum she! 'Avot de-Rabbi Natan mi-tokh Megillah,\" TarbisSl (1982): 201-22. 125 See Scholem, Major Trends, 50; idem, Jewish Gnosticism, 133; Bar-Ilan, iiHotmot Magiyyim.\" 126 Cf. the \"Book of the Princes\" (sefer ha-sarim) mentioned in the Sar-Torah text on the same fragment (G8 fol la line 35; fol. 2a in Gruenwald, Qeta'im). Gruenwald (iiQetaHm,\" 355) likens this scroll to a Greek-Jewish work published by Reitzenstein, Poimandres (Stutt­gart: B.G. Teubner, 1966), 291-300, entitled άρχαγγελική βίβλος, attributed to Moses. 127 Halperin, Faces of the Chariot, 370. 128 Moral requirements for the praxis are enumerated in stereotyped lists of virtues that are conditions for approaching the divine realm; see n. above. Here, moral virtues function magically. If these requirements seem slight, they are only prerequisites and not indicators of the moral stature of the customer. Cf. Halperin, Faces of the Chariot, 379-82. 129 Uppsala: A. B. Lundequistska Bokhandeln, 1950. Cf. also Jub. 1:5 and 4 Ezra 14. 130 Widengren describes a pattern that includes the enthronement of the recipient of the book, a motif that appears in the Hotam ha-Merkavah fragment. This motif has been shown by Wolfson (iiTeridah\") to be prominent in the ascent texts of Hekhalot literature."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"TRADITION AND AUTHORITY 203 and Hekhalot myths concerning the acquisition of the book derive from this common pattern, rather than one having been generated directly as a consequence of the other.131 THE MOTIF IN CONTEXT Such \"advertisements\" claiming the numinous origins and powers of the book or tradition are not confined to magical and medical books. Two of the most prominent \"ascent\" texts, Hekbalot Rabbati and Hekhalot Zu­tarti, contain significant passages of attestation regarding their contents. In the case of Hekhalot Zutarti, these are appended to the text; in the case of Hekhalot Rabbati they serve to introduce it. In Hekhalot Zutarti this takes the form of an appendix to the text (§424) in which the \"mishnah\" itself, that is, the Merkavah materials that have come before, are to be recited along with what appears to be a ritual for securing good fortune on the New Year.132 Hekhalot Rabbati is introduced by a series of finely crafted hymns accounting the glories (geduttah) available to the one who uses the text: He will be able to tell how many illegitimate children (mamzerim) there are in a family, his enemies will come down with horri­fying skin diseases, and so on.133 A remarkable thing about these passages is how little they correspond to the contents of the books they introduce. Introductions and testimonies such as these are highly conventional and can serve any such text. So too the legend of the secrets taught by the angel to Noah can serve both the magical text and medical manual. Indeed, the introduction of Sefer ha-Razim, while clearly letting the reader know that he is getting a magical book, is not an accurate portrayal of its contents: no known recension of Sefer ha-Razim contains instructions for making an ark out of gopher wood.134 Likewise, the chain of tradition motif in Hekhalot texts is free-floating and can be used for various genres within the corpora. In fact, none of these passages is integral to the texts in which it is set. In Merkavah Rab-bah, the testimony containing the Sar-Torah hymn (§§675-76) intervenes between a Hekhalot Zutarti unit and the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah; parallels to the Shi'ur Qomah chain suggest that §§734-35 may have been inserted into that complex; and the 3 Enoch chain appears in a collection of discrete traditions. It is possible that these attestations were added later 131 Cf. Halperin, Faces of the Chariot, 439-43. On the interrelationship of the Sinai and mystical traditions see especially Idel, \" Tefisat ha-Torah,\" which draws out many of the impli­cations of the role of the heavenly book and its relationship to the idea of Torah. 132 Halperin, \"New Edition,\" 550. 133 §§83-92.

We would thus be wise not to assume that the original use of Hekhalot Rabbati, Hekhalot Zutarti, or Ma 'aseh Merkavah was to obtain the practi­cal benefits listed in these passages. This writer's study of Ma'aseh Mer-kavah has shown how the redactors of that text appropriated hymns which were originally conceived as liturgical and ascribed to them the instru­mental power of affecting ascent and acquiring Torah.135 So too we must distinguish the goals of the ascent texts as these introductions and testi­monies portray them from their Sitz-im-Leben as determined by internal evidence. The affinity between magical texts and the testimonies to book and tradition in Hekhalot literature indicates that preexisting texts, of un­determined provenance, were taken by later authors to have been passed down in much the same way as magical texts were considered to have been transmitted. CONCLUSIONS This analysis has shown how the Hekhalot tradition saw itself as it devel­oped through the late talmudic and early geonic period. We have seen that the chains of tradition in Hekhalot literature are based on the rabbinic model but manifest subtle though meaningful differences from it. It is now possible to address the question of the social implications of these differences. The genres of validation described above serve to legitimate the texts they introduce and at the same time ascribe to them extraordin­ary power. Paradoxically, they both reinforce and supplant notions of au­thority held by rabbinic society. By setting the chain of tradition form in the context of Greco-Roman society, H. Fischel was able to underscore its social function: \"In the light of this material it does not seem impossible to assume that the passages Pirqe Aboth 1.1 ff. and Aboth deRabbi Nathan A initially still reflected the purpose of the Greco-Roman models, i.e., not only to illustrate the route of transmission but also to ascertain the authentic possession of the god-derived object and with it, the legitimate claim of its possessors to rule, a claim which is also otherwise made for both the Greco-Roman sophos-sapiens and his tannaitic counterpart, the Hakham.''''136 The rabbinic chains of tradition serve the function not only of support­ing the authority of the rabbis, but the rabbinic process of Torah transmis­sion itself. As Saldarini observes, \"The chain of tradition implies that the 135 Swartz, Mystical Prayer. 136 Fischel, \"Sorites,\" 126."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"TRADITION AND AUTHORITY 205 school of the rabbis, that is their teachings, thought, and way of life, stands at the center of Judaism and holds it together.\"137 In contrast, the authors of the esoteric and magical chains of tradition and its cognates advanced a counterclaim. In these testimonies, charisma is vested not in a particular class and its intellectual process, but in a potent name, ritual, or text. This name or text is valid for anyone who holds it. This emphasis on the accessibility of the book or tradition is particularly prominent in those passages that trace the origins and transmission of the magical book itself. To be sure, this contrast with the rabbinic ideology is modified in those texts, such as 3 Enoch, that stress the continuities of the Hekhalot tradition with that of the rabbis. Nonetheless, the essential dif­ferences in approach remain. It is possible to read the emphasis that the name of God is available \"to all Israel\" as a protest against rabbinic authority, as Halperin does.138 However, this discussion indicates that the relationship is somewhat more complex. These factors are indeed indications that at the stage of development at which these testimonies were written, this literature is not the product of the inner life of a rabbinic elite, trained at once in halakhah and the myste­ries of vision and theurgy. But its authors still look to that elite for inspira­tion. They adapt midrashim and legends found in rabbinic literature for the purposes of advertising these techniques.139 Ideal figures are thus used unexpectedly. They not only serve as role models for a mystical or intellec­tual discipline, but are put to practical use by their identification with the magic of the text.140 Like the sages of the Avot tradition, they serve a mediating function between God and the human community. They bring down, however, not the content of revelation, but its charismatic and provident power. 137 Saldarini, Scholastic Rabbinism, 77. 138 See Halperin, Faces of the Chariot, 382-83; cf. Urbach, Ha-Masoret. 139 This is not to say that all of the midrashim cited above originated in rabbinic circles. Indeed, many bear indications of beginnings in popular legends. These legends would thus be a common stock drawn on by both the rabbinic and esoteric literatures. 140 This function of ideal figures in mystical traditions can thus be added to those de­scribed in Steven T. Katz, \"Models, Modeling and Mystical Training,\" Religion (1982) 12: 247-75.

These questions concern the social and historical background of this literature; the relationship of the magicians and mystics in ancient Judaic society to the rabbinic estate and its values; and the rela­tionship between experience and ritual in Merkavah mysticism. We have examined the Sar-Torah texts, the dynamics of magical and Sar-Torah rit­uals, and the role of tradition and authority in Hekhalot and related litera­tures. The implications of these texts and themes for those questions can now be evaluated. THE SAR-TORAH TRADITION IN PERSPECTIVE The Sar-Torah and related texts concern magical techniques for gaining wisdom, memory, and skill in acquiring Torah. These texts fall into two general classifications: narrative texts that concern the cultivation of a spe­cific angel, the Sar-Torah or Sar ha-Panim, who brings the rabbi wisdom and skill; and other texts that promise the reader wisdom and intellectual capacity through performance of a specific ritual or recitation of a magical name. In many ways they resemble widely attested magical texts that pur­port to grant the practitioner some tangible benefit such as financial or social success, or supernatural power such as invisibility. However, the Sar-Torah texts deserve our attention for the mythic framework into which they are set, and for their prominence in the Hekhalot corpus. Now that they have been analyzed according to form-critical and thematic criteria, it is useful to look at this corpus in perspective. Sar-Torah Narrative The Sar-Torah narratives we have examined are wonder stories told for the purpose of recommending and introducing a magical procedure. Most of them tell how the magic of the Sar-Torah is responsible for the greatness and erudition of a famous rabbi, especially Rabbi Ishmael. The extensive Zerubbabel narrative in Hekhalot Rabbati extends this pattern to include a story of the origins of the Sar-Torah praxis at the beginning of the Second"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"210 CHAPTER 8 Temple period. The ritual texts for petihat lev and general wisdom, by contrast, are not framed to the same extent by narrative. As we have seen, there are precedents for this device of framing magical procedures in narrative. The historiola form and chain of tradition, exam­ined in Chapter 7, are common both to Jewish and non-Jewish magical texts. Most authors of magical texts are interested in validating their craft by recourse to a hallowed and powerful figure from the past, who is said to have performed his miracles and attained his heroic virtues though the very magic the present-day readers now have available to them. However, Sar-Torah narrative goes beyond the magical historiola form in framing the ritual procedures and magical names that are at the heart of the literature. Unlike, for example, magical amulets in which brief stories are set into incantation texts, narrative Sar-Torah texts are stories into which the rituals and names are set. At the same time, the rituals are clearly the rationale for the narrative. This is illustrated by common form in which the case of Rabbi Ishmael is linked to the present-day practitioner. After Rabbi Ishmael relates his success with the Sar-Torah procedure taught to him by Rabbi Nehuniah, he turns to the reader: \"And now, any student whose study is not sustained in him should stand and bless and rise and adjure in the name of. . .\" (§310). Likewise, in Merkavah Rabbah, when Rabbi Ishmael resolves a question about the procedure by asking Rabbi Akiba and Rabbi Nehuniah, he then turns to instruct his audience: \"And so, for anyone who uses this praxis, his mouth must utter names and the fingers of his hands must count until he counts 111 times\" (§681). Sar-Torah narratives also observe several common conventions of Hekha-Iot literature. As in the ascent texts, Shi'ur Qomah, and other areas of Hekhalot literature, Rabbi Ishmael, Rabbi Akiba, and Rabbi Nehuniah are the principal figures. The relationship between them is roughly the same as well; Rabbi Ishmael is the younger student, who also represents the reader who wishes to know the technique for traveling to the Merkavah, seeing the divine glory, or attracting the Sar-Torah. Rabbi Akiba is his senior colleague and Rabbi Nehuniah is his teacher. In a few texts, notably Merkavah Rab­bah, the ascent to the Merkavah and the Sar-Torah praxis are linked. Sar-Torah and Merkavah Traditions The Sar-Torah literature, therefore, stands at a nexus of ascent traditions in Hekhalot literature and magical and angelological traditions found else­where in Jewish literature of late antiquity. This position raises the ques­tion of the historical relationship between Hekhalot literature and the Sar-Torah texts. While determining that relationship is not the principal goal of this study, we have seen several factors that bear on this problem. David Halperin has argued that the Sar-Torah materials are integral to"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"SCHOLASTIC MAGIC 211 the ascent texts in Hekhalot literature, and that they played an important part in shaping them.1 The form-critical analysis undertaken above does not support this conclusion. In most cases where there seems to be a tex­tual link between Sar-Torah and ascent passages, the former have been added to the texts at a later stage of their redaction. None of the Sar-Torah texts is integral to an ascent text in the corpus. The Sar-Torah texts of MaiCiseh Merkavah were separate sections that had been incorporated into the larger structure of Ma'aseh Merkavah at a later date.2 Moreover, many of the Sar-Torah texts are appendixes to ascent texts, such as Hekhalot Rabbati, or placed among a series of miscellaneous brief units between major ascent texts. The Sar-Torah text in Merkavah Rabbah is a case in point. That Sar-Torah complex has been placed in the major manuscripts between two brief ascent units also found in Hekhalot Zutarti (§§671-76=344-48) and the Shi'ur Qomah (§688 and following). The final testi­monies of that complex, in which Rabbi Akiba does have a vision of the divine throne, serve to relate the preceding Sar-Torah material with the visionary Shi'ur Qomah tradition that follows. The ascent of Rabbi Akiba is not, therefore, integral to the Sar-Torah text in Merkavah Rabbah; nor can the Sar-Torah practice be considered the principal rationale for the vision­ary material. It has also been shown that the ritual procedures of abstention, isola­tion, and ablution found principally in the Sar-Torah texts were not for­mulated for the purpose of cultivating the vision of the heavens that figures in the ascent texts of Hekhalot literature. Therefore, we have reason to separate the two aims—attraction of the angel and ascent to heaven—in the corpus. At the same time, this study has found important affinities between the two traditions. For example, the model of Moses' approach to Sinai, elab­orated in midrashim and magical texts, resembles that of the mystic's ap­proach to the Merkavah and the Sar-Torah practitioner's cultivation of the angels. However, these affinities are most probably not as much due to direct borrowing as to a common dynamic that underlies them all. In these literatures, the human must approach the sphere of divine beings and therefore purify himself to an extraordinary degree. This pattern of ap­proach to the sacred is essentially cultic, and undergirds any ritual or mythic Jewish system that seeks to describe an individual's attempt to en­ter the divine realm. To realize this goal, the authors of the Sar-Torah traditions drew on a variety of midrashic, halakhic, and folkloric sources. The Hekhalot corpus is a complex network composed of different, in­terrelated strands. Numinous hymns, midrashic exposition of Ezekiel, 1 Halperin, Faces of the Chariot. 2 Swartz, Mystical Prayer."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"212 CHAPTER 8 ShicUr Qomah traditions, and practical magic all play a part in this compos­ite literature. The Sar-Torah and ascent narrative traditions are two of these strands. They are independent but have been placed together both in individual texts, such as Ma'aseh Merkavah and Hekhalot Zutarti, and in the Hekhalot corpus by later redactors who saw the purposes of ascent and acquisition of skill in Torah as intimately related. They were linked at a later stage in the development of the tradition. An interesting example of this later stage of development is the Sar-Torah section of the Hotam ha-Merkavah fragment (G8 and G22). This text clearly was written after the Hekhalot Rabbati and related traditions, on which it is probably dependent. It integrates Sar-Torah elements into an ascent narrative to a degree not found in the Synopse manuscript tradi­tion. There, unlike in the texts of the Synopse, the mystic receives the se­crets of the Sar-Torah in the course of an ascent. By the time of its composition, the relationship between these two strands of the Hekhalot tradition was probably taken for granted. Dating and Provenance It is difficult to date the Sar-Torah texts individually or the literature as a whole. Like most of Hekhalot literature, they contain no specific and reli­able historical allusions to link them to a particular time and place. Since the literature does not abound in genres, such as liturgical poetry, that can be dated on stylistic grounds, formal criteria are of limited value for dat­ing.3 However, it is useful to evaluate what evidence we have. Scholem and others have argued that the ascent traditions preserved in Hekhalot literature are echoed in several talmudic passages.4 In contrast, Sar-Torah traditions do not appear to have direct parallels in early rabbinic literature. Such affinities described above between Sar-Torah narratives and midrashim of Moses' ascent are more typological than indicative of a genetic relationship. This argues against an early date for a Sar-Torah genre that influenced rabbinic literature. However, we may establish a terminus ad quern for the Sar-Torah phe­nomenon. Salmon b. Yeruhim's tenth-century Book of the Wars of the Lord contains a detailed paraphrase of the Zerubbabel Sar-Torah narrative in Hekhalot Rabbati. As noted in Chapter 6 above, Hai Gaon's responsum regarding Merkavah mysticism is based in part on a passage from Hekhalot Zutarti (§424). This passage, while not a Sar-Torah text per se, does re-3 Cf. ibid., 216-17. 4 SchoJem, Gnosticism; cf. Urbach, \"Ha-Masoret\" HaJperin, Merkavah in Rabbinic Liter­ature; Morray-Jones, \"Hekhalot Literature and Talmudic Tradition.\" See the Introduction above."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"SCHOLASTIC MAGIC 213 semble ritual testimonies found in Sar-Torah texts throughout Hekhalot corpus. We can therefore suppose that this literary type was well estab­lished by Hai's time. The earliest explicit indications of the Sar-Torah phenomenon, then, date from the tenth century. However, there are other elements of the phenomenon that have earlier origins. The archangel figure represented by Metatron appears in the Talmud and in the seventh-century Babylonian incantation bowls, although not as the Sar-Torah.5 Jewish magical tech­niques used by the Sar-Torah practitioners date from the early centuries c.E. at the latest. And, as we have seen, the application of folk medicine and magic to memory is also rooted in Judaism of late antiquity.6 While specific, meaningful historical references are few in the literature, we can, perhaps, detect a few hints of the literature's provenance from internal evidence. The Hekhalot Rabbati narrative has as its major figure Zerubbabel, who is the subject of an apocalyptic text from Byzantine Pal­estine. Although there is no direct dependence of the former text on the latter, the correspondence leaves open the possibility that the Hekhalot Rabbati Sar-Torah tradition has Palestinian roots. It should also be noted that Salmon ben Yeruhim probably lived in Palestine.7 However, there are also indications of another geographic factor in a later section of the text. At §305, a testimony attesting to the success of the praxis has been ap­pended to the Zerubbabel text. The magic, say the rabbis, is so potent that it is effective in the Diaspora: \"Thus Rabbi Eliezer the Great and the sages said, 'Perhaps we have the merit of the land of Israel in our favor.' They did not believe it until they sent Rabbi Akiba to Babylonia and it was per­formed and it succeeded.\" This suggests that the author expected that his Babylonian readers would be concerned about whether the ritual could be performed there. The Hotam ha-Merkavah fragments, which integrate Sar-Torah elements, praise the \"house of the rabbi in Babylonia.\"8 Moreover, the Aramaic texts related to Sar-Torah practices, such as the Aramaic text in Ma'aseh Mer-kavah and the incantation for the Great Name, are in the Babylonian dia­lect.9 A Babylonian provenance for much of this material is thus likely. It is also probable that the phenomenon has its origins in the Amoraic period and took further shape in the early Geonic period.10 5 See, for example, Gordon, Bowls D and L, where Metatron appears as the Great Prince. 6 See Chapter 2. 7 See Nemoy, Karaite Anthohgyi 69. 8 G8, fol. 2a, line 14. 9 Cf. also Havdalah de-Rabbi Akibah, also a Babylonian Aramaic magical text. 10 This thesis corresponds to other recent judgments about the provenance of Hekhalot texts. Cf. Cohen, Shi'ur Qomah, 51-71; see Swartz, Mystical Prayer, 220, and the studies cited there."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"214 CHAPTER 8 THE SAR-TORAH TRADITION: SOCIAL INDICATIONS It is now possible to assess the evidence for the social position of the au­thors of the Sar-Torah texts. The Sar-Torah narratives associate themselves with rabbinic values and history in two important ways. First, by casting three prominent early sages, Rabbis Ishmael, Akiba, and Nehuniah, in the role of heroes of the literature, they have expressed their conviction that the status of rabbi is the greatest glory of the ordinary Jew. As we will see, however, this status carries with it, according to these texts, not only the distinction of being a great scholar, but more worldly honors and powers as well. Second, the raison d'etre of the texts—the need for a potent mem­ory in rabbinic education—testifies to the primacy of the values of Torah study and rabbinic scholasticism. Nonetheless, we have seen indications that several elements in Sar-Torah texts diverge from what are conventionally seen as rabbinic attitudes to ritual, revelation, and authority. This stance of the literature, which shows itself both beholden to rabbinic values and distinct from them, can be of use in locating the social position of its authors. The implications of two major examples of this position, ritual and authority, are examined here. Ritual and Purity It has been established that the chief goal of the rituals of abstention and isolation in the principal Sar-Torah texts is to prepare the human practi­tioner for his encounter with powerful and volatile divine beings, who are to fulfill his requests for wisdom and skill in learning. The practitioner must go to extraordinary means to achieve the requisite state of purity. As we have seen, rituals in the Sar-Torah and related texts show signs of a variety of influences, from rabbinic halakhah to Greco-Roman notions of the body. When halakhah comes into play, it is not the halakhah of the mainstream, but of a minority of rabbinic Jews of the talmudic and geonic periods that is reflected. The story of Rabbi Nehuniah's deposition in Hekbalot Rabbati is a case in point. It has been noted that the story's approach to ritual purity is extrahalakhic.11 This approach also informs the rituals of purity and avoidance in the Sar-Torah texts. Sar-Torah rituals prescribe standards of menstrual purity well beyond those of the main­stream of halakhah. However, it has been shown that several atypical texts of the late rabbinic and geonic periods reflect similar standards. A key text in the interpretation of the Rabbi Nehuniah story is Braita de-Massekbet Niddah', described in Chapter 6 above.

Its deviation from rabbinic halakhah goes well beyond its extraordinary strictness with regard to menstrual purity; its teachings fly in the face of clear rabbinic dicta.12 Braita de-Massekhet Nid­dah reflects folk beliefs and practices regarding the impurity of women that persisted from the talmudic period well into the Middle Ages. Two cus­toms, the removal of the menstruant from the house and denial of her entry into the synagogue, were entrenched among the laity in many com­munities, despite the repeated denunciations of these practices by the rab­binic leadership. In Bmita de-Massekhet Niddah, these customs are based on the ideas that the menstruant's speech or breath itself is polluting and that the earth that she walks on is impure. Such notions also inform the ritual prohibitions we find in Hekhalot literature. These texts are thus important evidence for the study of popular religion in the talmudic period and offer an opportunity to see ritual practices in early Jewish mysticism as evidence for the same.13 The unusual purity cus­toms can take their place with folk practices such as kapparot, tashlikh, and other extrahalakhic rituals.14 Like the practice of the separation of the menstruant, these customs were discouraged by rabbinic leadership. In case of our mystics and magicians, however, the extrahalakhic dimen­sion of these rituals and its implications for their relationship to rabbinic Judaism are more complex. To understand the ambivalence of the Sar-Torah practitioners to rabbinic law and ideals, we must explore the impli­cations of the Sar-Torah texts' approach to tradition and authority. Tradition and Authority When we turn to the Sar-Torah literature's notions of tradition and au­thority for indication of the social position of its authors, we can learn both from its affinities with the rabbinic tradition and ethos and its deviations from them. The comparison of their use of ideal figures and chains of tradition with their rabbinic counterparts undertaken above provides a case in point. In Chapter 7, it was shown that the Hekhalot literature's approach to the use of ideal figures and chains of tradition had its roots in the genre of 12 See Dinari, \"Minhage Tum'at ha-Niddah,\" 304-5. Indeed, the book seems at times to be a pallid imitation, if not an outright parody, of mishnaic literature. The text cites \"Haninah ben ha-Qannah\" (for Nehuniah ben ha-Qannah) and opens with the words, \"Shammai says,\" which also begin m. Niddah. This led Schechter (\"Jewish Literature,\" 339) to propose that the sources of the text can be found among Karaites or Samaritans. This view has been refuted by Dinari, ilMinhage Tum'at ha-Niddah\"·, cf. Lieberman, Sheqi'in, 22. 13 See below on the term popular religion as applied to this phenomenon; cf. also the Introduction above. 14 On these folk rituals see the studies collected in Jacob Z. Lauterbach, Studies in Jewish Law, Custom and Folklore (n.p.: Ktav, 1970); and idem, \"Tashlik.\""},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"216 CHAPTER 8 magical historiola. Historiolae in Jewish magical texts appropriate motifs found in rabbinic midrashim for the purpose of validating their power to heal, improve memory, and so on. Indeed, at times these midrashim can be traced directly to textual exegeses of scripture. The Sar-Torah texts, however, went further than other magical texts in this appropriation of common motifs. Their authors invoked the authority of the early rabbis to promote their magical recipes. Moreover, these recipes offer nothing less than shortcuts to success in the very endeavor most valued by the rabbinic estate—the study of Torah. Like the mystics described in Steven Katz's essay, \"Models, Modelling, and Mystical Training,\" the Sar-Torah practitioners and magical writers adopted ideal figures as their own.15 Moses, Joshua, and Rabbis Ishmael and Akiba are all represented by the texts as having participated in the mystical and magical traditions in ways that could not be anticipated from their depiction in biblical and rabbinic literatures. However, this appro­priation of their personae has a dual effect. As Katz observes elsewhere, mystical experiences provide not radical exegesis of scripture but experiential confirmation of it.16 So too the ten­dency in magical texts to appeal to biblical and rabbinic authority rein­forces the power of that authority in a particular way. As Katz observes: \"This very use of allegory and symbolism, as well as other varied her-meneutical devices, functions to maintain the authority of the canonical sources under interpretation rather than to destroy or transcend them, as is usually assumed. That is to say, the presupposition on which the mystical use of allegory and symbolic modes of exegesis depends is that the canoni­cal books of one's tradition do in fact possess truth and authority claimed for them.\"17 The same can be said about the Hekhalot literature's use of ideal figures. The attribution of Sar-Torah magic to central sages of the tannaitic age serves to maintain rabbinic notions of authority and its rela­tionship to Torah. Yet because Torah was conceived not only as a corpus of knowledge, but as a process carried out by a particular class of scholars, the Sar-Torah phenomenon circumvents the social circumstances under which this cen­tral rabbinic activity is to take place. It does so by offering a way to attain scholastic knowledge and success instantly. Moreover, magical and Sar-Torah texts use ideal figures more directly. They are not simply exempla to be emulated, like Katz's mystical models, but serve in effect as powerful intercessors whose past miraculous deeds and potent magical tools aid the contemporary individual seeking something of their achievement. 15 Katz, \"Models\"; see also Nickelsberg, Ideal Figures. 16 Katz, \"'Conservative' Character,\" 20.

There are inconsistencies in the chain of tradition in Hekhalot literature and in the lists of rabbis in Rabbi Nehuniah's fellow­ship in Hekbalot Rabbati.18 Furthermore, there is little in rabbinic litera­ture to support the depiction of Rabbi Ishmael and Rabbi Nehuniah as masters of magical secrets.19 It is unlikely that these writers, who probably lived centuries after the tannaim to which they attributed their texts, had access to in-house political and historiographic traditions such as those employed by Sherira Gaon and other post-talmudic writers. It follows that they stood outside the circles in which those traditions were transmitted.20 Social Indications: Conclusions The Sar-Torah and related texts thus manifest a deep ambivalence toward rabbinic notions of Torah, tradition, and purity. These factors are indica­tions that, at least at the stage of development at which these testimonies were written, this literature is not the product of the inner life of a rabbinic elite, trained at once in halakhah and the mysteries of vision and theurgy. Rather, we can look to other sectors of Jewish society in late antiquity to place its authors. This study has shown that the Sar-Torah and related texts incorporate elements of popular religion. The idea of \"popular religion\" has undergone some transformation in the past few decades. Many earlier accounts of the relationship between elite and popular religion tended to see them as two separate cultures. But recent research reveals complex patterns of interaction and appropriation between social strata—evidence of what have been termed \"reciprocal\" or \"circular\" relationships between the classes or estates.21 Discussion has also shifted from the pattern of the resistance and accommodation of en­during popular \"superstitions\" by the elite to the underlying mentality that allows both to appropriate a given belief or ritual pattern.22 Moreover, religious phenomena of social groups lying between the elite and the peasantry are often overlooked. To gain a more complete picture of ancient cultures, it is necessary to offer perspectives into worldviews of 18 See Chapter 7 and Dan, \" Tefisat ha-Historiah.\" 19 Rabbi Akiba is represented in t. Hag. 2:2 as one of the four who entered the Pardes, and Rabbi Ishmael is depicted in B. Ber. 7a as having a divine vision. However, the latter tradition is not prominent in Hekhalot literature. 20 Indeed, the attitude of the texts toward these rabbis is closer to that found in folkloric sources. Cf. the wonder stories of Rabbi Ishmael in Liqqute ha-Pardes discussed in Chapter 6 above. 21 See the discussion in Carlo Ginzburg, The Cheese and the Worms: The Cosmos of a Sixteenth-Century Miller (New York: Penguin, 1987), xiv-xviii. Cf. also Davis, \"Tasks and Themes.\" 22 See Peter Brown, The Cult of the Saints."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"218 CHAPTER 8 those whose literacy does not reflect an elite education.23 This study has shown the intersections of the ethos of the rabbinic intelligentsia of the talmudic period and other spheres of religious culture in ancient Judaism. This ethos was appropriated and recast by ritual practitioners and sto­rytellers who wished to achieve for themselves the tangible benefits— honor, power, and wealth—of that intelligentsia. The authors of the Sar-Torah and related texts were not illiterate—indeed, we should recog­nize the extent to which many practitioners of what we call popular reli­gion, especially in Jewish society, had some degree of literacy. Thus the evidence for this phenomenon is found in literary texts at the fringes of the rabbinic canon, as well as in magical texts and mantic handbooks. As Charles Long points out, it is not uncommon for esoteric beliefs to be held in the lower strata of society.24 The Sar-Torah and related texts can be considered esoteric not in that they are available only to a select few, but according to the rhetorical tension of esotericism and exotericism de­scribed in Chapter 7. They present themselves as at once having been revealed to a select succession of ancients and having been made available to all by virtue of their inclusion in the book the reader now holds. In addition, the recondite magical names and ritual procedures add an air of mystery to the magic. At the same time, we cannot assign our authors to the lower classes, in light of the degree of education, artistry, and acquaintance (if limited) with rabbinic tradition found in these texts. The authors were aware of the relative chronology of rabbinic succession, although their grasp of its par­ticulars was not entirely accurate. Their knowledge of biblical literature and statutory liturgy also distinguished them from the wholly uneducated. Where, then, can we look in ancient Jewish society for the authors of our texts? It is important to recognize that we cannot go beyond the evi­dence in specifying a social group that may have produced this literature; its pseudepigraphic and rhetorical nature is designed precisely to mask its social origins and our evidence for social strata in Jewry of late antiquity is limited. However, we can point to segments of those societies that shared the characteristics described above as possible social locations of the phenomenon. One important source of religious activity that was not entirely within rabbinic jurisdiction was the synagogue. This may seem surprising, since synagogue liturgy and conduct is discussed at length in early rabbinic liter­ature, and the synagogue as it emerged from the Middle Ages onward was in many ways a rabbinic institution.25 However, there is mounting evi-23 Ginzburg, The Cheese and the Worms, deals with such a case. 24 Charles Long, \"Popular Religion,\" ER 11:440-52. 25 For an account of the struggle for rabbinic authority in the synagogue see Lawrence A. Hoffman, The Canonization of the Synagogue Service (Notre Dame, Ind.: Notre Dame Uni­versity Press, 1979)."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"SCHOLASTIC MAGIC 219 dence that ancient synagogues functioned as autonomous institutions from the rabbinic academies and resisted the rabbis' attempts to regulate their activities.26 The evidence for this has been summarized recently in an important paper by Lee I. Levine.27 Nor was the liturgical poetry of the synagogue always sanctioned by the rabbinic authorities.28 This tension continued into the Middle Ages, as S. D. Goitein has shown from Genizah documents.29 The synagogue was the locus of several types of secondary religious authority. Affinities between the creativity of the liturgical poets (payetanim) and composers of Merkavah hymnology has been shown,30 and these circles could have nurtured other esoteric activity such as that of the Sar-Torah literature. Besides liturgical poets, there were preachers, tar-gumists, and other functionaries who would have been influenced by the academy yet did not participate fully in its intellectual life. Another significant social role was fulfilled by scribes. Scribes in ancient and Jewish medieval society were not necessarily rabbis.31 Recent research on magical texts from the Genizah suggests that professional scribes may have been called upon to compose and transmit magical texts for local clients.32 Also recently, David Frankfurter has shown a deep connection between scribal expertise and ethos and the conceptualization and compo­sition of magical texts in Greco-Roman Egypt.33 As the Sar-Torah and Merkavah traditions were transmitted to Byzan­tium and central Europe, they were taken up increasingly by the rabbinic leadership. The Chronicle of Ahimaaz represents the tradition's founding heroes as masters of mystical secrets, and the Haside Ashkenaz were indus-26 On the distinction between the synagogue and the Bet Midrash, see Dan Urman, \"The House of Assembly and the House of Study: Are They One and the Same?\" JJS 44 (1993): 236-57. 27 Yisrael Levine, \"Bet Kenneset ke-Mosad Kehilati: Mi Qava' et MediniutoV Proceedings of the Eleventh World Congress of Jewish Studies Division B (Jerusalem: World Union of Jewish Studies, 1994), 1-8 (Hebrew section).

But by the high Middle Ages, the authors of the Hekhalot pseudepigraphies had achieved their goal of having their revela­tions accepted as those of Rabbis Ishmael and Akiba. This brief survey of non-elite religious groups in the rabbinic milieu has not proven that the Sar-Torah literature came from one of them; rather it has served to convey something of the social texture in which our authors may have arisen. Each of these groups can be characterized as non-elite intellectuals; each was involved in activity unsanctioned by the rabbis; and each was also apparently beholden to the rabbinic system for many of its core values. Recently, scholars of Gnosticism have also sought to find its social location in circles of non-elite intellectuals.35 The Sar-Torah literature thus cannot be characterized either as the product of the ignorant masses or of the scholarly class. For Jewish society in late antiquity was not composed merely of an elite and a lower class of 'am ha-'ares; we have seen that there were synagogue functionaries, scribes, non-intellectual professional reciters (tannaim), and a complex network of professions and social groups. These groups were literate and acquainted with much rabbinic law and lore; and yet they still stood out­side the central circles of the rabbinic academy and may at times have been in tension with them. The dialectic described above between the exoteric and esoteric im­pulses in these literatures would thus serve to set the practitioners apart from the values of the majority and of the elite, but assure those who lacked the social status of that elite that they too could attain the learning and prestige of a Hillel or Rabbi Ishmael. Their investment of a book or divine name with instrumental power served at once to circumvent the scholastic tradition—by placing its charisma outside of the specific disci­pline of the academy—and at the same time to maintain it—by acknowl­edging its source in biblical revelation and rabbinic succession. The Hekhalot texts often boast of the superiority of the one who has traveled to the Merkavah or used the Sar-Torah magic. The most conspic­uous example is the introduction to Hekhalot Rabbati, which details the wondrous powers of the mystics.36 This would seem to correlate with their 34 On the Byzantine channels of esoteric literature see especially Wolfson, \"Shabbatai Donnolo.\" 35 Cf. Wevers, \"tJberlegenheidt,\" 22, and the literature cited there on analogues to the social situation of Gnosticism; see Kurt Rudolph, Gnosis: The Nature and History of Gnosti­cism (San Francisco: Harper and Row, 1987), 288-94, on Gnosticism as the expression of dependent urban classes and displaced intellectuals; cf.

Wewers, \"LJberlegenheit.\""},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"SCHOLASTIC MAGIC 221 emphasis on esotericism and privilege and the exclusion of those who are morally or physically unfit, or of the wrong sex. However, we would be mistaken to assume that the authors therefore constituted an actual social elite.37 They clearly aspired to elite status and considered themselves cut off from that status. Their \"elitism\" was akin to that of secret societies and similar groups, who can be found at any social level and whose esoteric nature functions primarily to convince its members of their validity and power. TORAH AND WISDOM We have seen that the Sar-Torah and related phenomena negotiate be­tween rabbinic scholasticism and practical magic. Can we ascertain a dis­tinctive religious purpose behind these texts? After he has acquired the great book or learned the powerful mystery, fasted the requisite number of days, fought off angels, and successfully communicated with the proper divine beings, what does the practitioner get for all his troubles? According to the Sar-Torah traditions, the practitioner acquires Torah. This deceptively simple idea is expressed in several ways and can mean several things. The principal nouns employed in this corpus for the goals of the praxes are Torah and Hokhmah (wisdom). To be sure, these concepts are not necessarily identical in the literature; the nuances are explored be­low. Other specific categories of study are listed: Scripture (miqra); mish-nah, which is a term used in the literature both to refer to the mishnaic traditions themselves and to any textual unit;38 talmud, which probably refers to the comparative study of mishnaic and related traditions and not to the actual text of the Talmud itself; halakhah; and shemu'ah, traditions or legal decisions that are heard by the student. In the poetic dialogue in the Hekhalot Rabbati Sar-Torah section, God lists the types of learning Israel wishes to acquire: I know what you seek, and My heart has recognized what you desire: much Torah is what you seek, and a multitude of study and a great many traditions, and to inquire of the law is what you wish for, and a multitude of secrets39 is what you desire, to increase testimony in mountains upon mountains, to pile up sagacity in hills upon hills, to increase study in the courtyards 37 See above. 38 Cf. 706, referring to the Shi'ur Qomah, and 335 referring to Hekhalot Zutarti. 39 Reading razy[m\\ with MS.

(§287) This list of types of learning clearly presupposes that rabbinic study con­stitutes wisdom. Some of these passages are evidence for a notion of the rabbinic curriculum.40 In such later texts as Midrash Mishle, the knowl­edge of the cosmos, including that of the Hekhalot and the Shi'ur Qomah, is placed quite naturally alongside of Torah, halakhah, and midrash. Skill The Sar-Torah practitioner acquires Torah by gaining a set of practical skills. First of all and most important, he acquires a prodigious memory and retains what he has learned. The Sar-Torah narratives about the young Rabbi Ishmael illustrate this. In these stories it is Rabbi Ishmael's memory that is at fault and that must be improved by means of the Sar-Torah technique taught by Rabbi Nehuniah. When the praxis succeeded, \"Never again did I forget anything my ears heard from my teacher, of study; nor would I ever again forget anything of the paths of Torah in which I en­gaged for their truth.\" As we have seen, the Sar-Torah phenomenon attests to the important place of memorization not only in rabbinic culture, but in antiquity in general. In classical antiquity and the Middle Ages through the Renais­sance, scholastics employed exoteric and esoteric mnemonic techniques to aid memory. Some of these, particularly those that involved the building of a \"palace\" which held the items or points to be recalled, attained an intri­cacy common to esoteric systems.41 Some of these exercises amounted to litde more than parlor games.42 But often, they enabled public figures, orators, and intellectuals to perform impressive feats of recitation and re­call. While others relied on pedagogic techniques and a few mnemotechni-cal devices such as simanim, the Sar-Torah practitioners summoned the angels themselves to aid them in their memorization and retention. 40 See Chapter 4. 41 The reader will note that the ascent texts in Hekhalot literature also concern \"palaces\"—that is, the celestial Hekhalot themselves. This might prompt the speculation that the palaces described in Hekhalot literature may indeed be related to the classical memory palaces—the former functioning as a framework for the Sar-Torah practitioner to place eso­teric or rabbinic lore and thus aid memorization. As attractive as such a speculation might be, there is no textual evidence to support it. However, it is not impossible that there is a mne­monic dimension to the \"lists of revealed things\" in apocalyptic and cosmological Hekhalot traditions. These elements of Hekhalot literature are discussed below. 42 For an example, see Jonathan Spence, The Memory Palace of Mateo Ricci."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"SCHOLASTIC MAGIC 223 Material and Spiritual Advantages The increased skill in study that the Sar-Torah practitioner acquires results in very palpable social advantages, which in turn lead to betterment of his material condition. The Sar-Torah text in Hekhalot Rabbati is particularly explicit about the social status that the Sar-Torah secrets will grant. In God's poetic speech enumerating the things Israel longs for, proficiency in Torah and judgment flows seamlessly into social status. His list of types of wisdom quoted above (§287) continues: To establish sessions [yeshivot] in the gates of the tents, to expound in them the forbidden and permitted, to declare pure in them that which is pure, and to declare impure in them that which is impure; to declare (ritually) fit \\kasher\\ that which is fit, and to declare unfit that which is unfit, to recognize in them types of blood, and to instruct the menstruant in what to do; to tie crowns on your heads, and the wreath of royalty on the heads of your children, to compel kings to bow down to you, and to obligate nobles to prostrate before you; To spread your name on every shore. and your renown in the ports of the seas. (§288) The ability—that of a wise rabbi and judge—to recognize types of men­strual blood and declare what is forbidden and permitted will lead natu­rally to the practitioners' influence and fame. The resulting wisdom will take on almost supernatural effects. The poem continues: to enlighten your faces with the radiance of the day, between your eyes like the planet Venus. If you merit this seal, to make use of My crown, no ignorant person shall ever be found, and there shall not be a fool or simpleton among you. Indeed, in the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah and Merkavah Rabbah, Rabbi Ishmael testifies to his enlightenment, which is likened to an almost messianic event. And when I heard this great mystery, my eyes were enlightened and all that I heard—whether scriptures, Mishnah, or anything—I would not forget any­more. The world was renewed [for me] in purity, and it was as if I had come"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"224 CHAPTER 8 into a new world. (§309) When my ears heard this great mystery, the world was transformed for me for purity, and my heart was such that it was as if I had come into a new world. And each and every day it seemed to me as if I were standing before the Throne of Glory. (§680) Other material and spiritual benefits are said to result from the mere recitation of Sar-Torah and Hekhalot texts. In the Chapter of Rabbi Ne-huniah version B, Rabbi Ishmael declares not only that one who \"recites this mystery\" will have social status, but that he will be physically attractive and furthermore will be spared evil in this world and punishment in the world to come: \"His stature will be pleasing, his speech will be accepted and fear of him will be rest on (fellow-) creatures, and his dreams will be calm, and he will be saved from all kinds of tribulations and witchcraft, and from the judgment of Gehinnom\" (§311). As we have seen, this testimony follows a pattern of declarations in mag­ical texts and others about the attendant benefits of the text they recom­mend. Not all of these benefits are directly related to the explicit purpose of the texts. The poetic introduction to the ascent section of Hekhalot Rabbati known as thegedullah hymns (§81-93) is a case in point.43 These hymns claim powers of divination and worldly accolades not mentioned in the body of Hekhalot Rabbati. Most likely, the authors were able to make these claims because of the presumed powers of the names contained in them—powers that were understood to operate independent of the pur­poses for which they are used. A particularly wide range of powers is as­cribed to those who know the Great Name: \"Anyone who knows this great name will [be able to] take a lion by the ears and a serpent by the skull of its head. Ifhe rages at the sea it will dry,44 and if at a fire, if it rages, it will be extinguished. If he wants to kill, he can kill, and if he wants to revive, he can revive.\" The talmudic attestation to the power of the forty-two-letter name is parallel to the testimony from the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah quoted above: \"Anyone who knows it and is careful with it and guards it in purity is beloved above and esteemed below, and fear of him rests on (fellow-) creatures; and he inherits two worlds: this world and the world to come.\"45 More prosaic versions of this type of testimony, in which the material and apotropaic benefits of performing a particular mitzvah, such as the recitation of the Shemai, can be found in the Talmud.46 In the geonic period, the material benefits of the study of Torah were also enumerated in 43 See Wewers, \"tJberlegenheit\" and Chapter 7 above. 44 Cf. Nahum 1:6, adapted in Ma'aseh Merkavah 596. 45 B. Qid. 71a. See Chapter 5 above. 46 Cf., for example, the list of statements in b. Ber. 5a regarding the apotropaic powers of reciting the Shema'."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"SCHOLASTIC MAGIC 225 an talmudic apocryphon known as Pereq Qinyan Torab, which was ap­pended to the tractate Avot. Its language bears some resemblance to these testimonies. According to a statement attributed to Rabbi Meir, anyone who engages in Torah will be beloved and honored by God and human beings and more: \"[People] benefit by his counsel and perspicacity, dis­cernment and might, as it is said: 'Mine are counsel and perspicacity; I am discernment and mine is might' [Prov. 8:14].47 And he is granted kingship and governance,48 and capacity for judgment, and secrets of Torah [ raze Torah] are revealed to him.\" Pereq Qinyan Torah also stresses the student's need for modesty and that he is not to pursue honor for its own sake.49 The Sar-Torah literature, however, refined the emphasis on the material and spiritual benefits of Torah found in such exhortatory statements virtually to the point of hypostasis. Wisdom The Sar-Torah is sometimes known as the Sar-Hokhmah, the \"Prince of Wisdom.\"50 Several texts speak primarily of the wisdom to be gained by the praxis; at times, the Torah itself is not mentioned. In the Sar ha-Panim incantation, the angel is said to reveal \"the secrets of above and below and the profundity51 of the foundations of below and the enigmas of wis­dom and the skills of perspicacity [ta'alumot hokhmah ve-'ormat toshiah]\" (§623). In many cases, it is difficult to tell exactly what these terms mean. The Sar ha-Panim text uses language from Job and Proverbs—ta'alumot hokhmah ve-'ormat toshiah—where they probably refer to practical wis­dom. However, the references to \"profundity\" and \"enigmas\" probably indicate that these terms have a deeper connotation for the author. It is possible that in some instances hokhmah simply refers to the indi­vidual's intelligence and insight in his analysis of Torah, halakhah, and tradition. In talmudic terminology, he thus would not only become Sinai —knowing and retaining vast amounts of material—but 'oqer harim— able to uproot mountains with his sharp analytical skills.52 In general, though, intelligence was equated with the ability to memorize. This can be seen from the end of the Sar-Torah narrative of Hekhalot Rabbati, in 47 Cf. the use of these terms in the incantation for the Great Name (489). 48 Or, \"they [that is, people] grant him. . . .\" 49 See, for example, Avot 6:5.

They sent Rabbi Akiba out of the land [of Israel], by authority of a court, and he was detained until it was done by the populace, who could not read or recite, and they were made equal to advanced scholars \\talmide hakhamim]\" (§305). Here the wisdom acquired by the fools and shepherds consists in their newfound ability to read Scripture and recite mishnaic traditions, and their knowledge. However, a much broader and more esoteric notion of wisdom is re­flected in most Sar-Torah texts. This concept of wisdom has a mystical dimension and has its roots in apocalyptic texts and the wisdom tradition. But it is not unrelated to the scholastic dimension of those traditions. Secrets The Sar-Torah and Merkavah practitioners, like the mystagogue and apoc­alyptic hero, acquire a specific body of knowledge. They acquire knowl­edge of the cosmos and its inhabitants, and of the secret means for performing wondrous deeds. In the Sar ha-Panim incantation, the practi­tioner implores the angel to reveal to him \"all the profundities of the mys­teries of above and below and the secrets of the hidden places of above and the mysteries of understanding and the skills of perspicacity\" (§634).53 Knowledge of the heavens and their workings is necessary for practicing the Sar-Torah rituals. When Rabbi Ishmael is rebuked by the Sar ha-Panim in Ma'aseh Merkavah, the narrator wishes to make it clear that without the specific knowledge of how to attract the heavenly hosts, Rabbi Ishmael runs the risk of angering the angels. Rabbi Nehuniah's instructions in that text revolve around the details of the angelic personnel and the proper protocol for approaching them. In the poetic preamble to the Hekhalot Rabbati Sar-Torah text, God declares that He will place His miraculous ways at the disposal of Israel so that they can acquire the Sar-Torah study techniques that facilitate learn­ing. He will exercise His marvelous providential powers and extract divine secrets from His storehouses: For I am a Master of wonders and Lord of extraordinary deeds. Mighty deeds break forth before Me, miracles and marvels before My throne. 53 Cf. the introduction to this ritual (§623), quoted above."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"SCHOLASTIC MAGIC 227 And who has come before me whom I did not reward?54 Who has called upon me whom I did not answer at once?55 State your supplications before me and tell me profusely the desire of your souls. (§285) There is nothing lacking in my treasuries and storehouses. Utter your requests and they will be given to you, and the desire of your souls will be fulfilled for you at once. (§286) The wisdom offered by the Sar-Torah praxis is, therefore, a form of divine knowledge. God is praised in this literature not only as the giver of Torah, but as the one who has stored up the secrets of the universe. These secrets are associated with the specific mysteries (razim) that are the rituals and divine names that the texts themselves present to the reader. The Sar-Torah prayer in Merkavah Rabbah and the introduction to Ma'aseh Mer-kavah provides an interesting illustration of this combination of themes: You have revealed the secrets, and the deepest of secrets, and You revealed the mysteries [setarim], and the deepest of mysteries to Moses [. . .] So that the children of Israel can engage in Torah with them, and increase study56 with them. As has been pointed out above,57 the secrets revealed to Moses and his successors consist not only of the Torah itself, but the magical means to learn it. It must also be remembered that rabbinic literature attests to the idea that there is an esoteric dimension to the Torah. It is unclear whether the raze Torah mentioned in the passage from Pereq Qinyan Torah quoted above consist of cosmic secrets or the more intricate details of rabbinic learning. At Qumran, nistar was a specifically legal term for the aspects of the law that had not been revealed outside the high council.58 Midrashic statements also make it clear that the Torah is vast enough to accommo­date all such notions. Indeed, the Torah itself is said to be of literally cos­mic dimensions.59 In his groundbreaking article on the concept of Torah in Hekhalot liter-54 Cf. Job 41:3. 55 Cf. Cant. 5:6. 56 Heb. talmud.

While this specific technique of derivation of names from the Torah text is not reflected in the Sar-Torah literature, its analogue—that along with Torah the mystic or magician receives magical benefits—is a promi­nent theme in our texts. Moreover, the equation of wisdom with knowledge of cosmology and angelology is an ancient idea with its roots in wisdom and apocalyptic literatures.62 From those psalms in which a hypostatized wisdom declares her divine origins63 to the \"lists of revealed things\" in apocalyptic texts,64 there is a scribal tradition in which cosmology and esoteric subjects are included in the category of wisdom. The \"guided tours\" of apocalyptic texts are most probably the direct ancestors of the ascent and cosmological texts in the Hekhalot literature.65 The innovation of the ascent texts in Hekhalot literature was to portray that journey not as a result of God's initiative, but of the active effort of human beings to visit those sights and attend the divine throne. In the Sar-Torah texts, however, the secrets of heaven have another function. They allow the practitioner to use that knowledge for bringing down the angel of the Torah. This angel, in turn, enlightens the practitioner with the capacity to discern the very cosmic secrets contained in that Torah itself. This may be why redactors of Hekhalot literature included Sar-Torah materials together with ascent texts, although their goals and procedures were distinct. For the later redactors of Ma 'aseh Merkavah, the Sar-Torah function of the literature was primary.66 It seemed natural to them to incorporate Sections I and IV, an ascent text that includes lists of angelic names and enumerations of the heaven, because knowledge of those de­tails was entirely consistent with the goal of the acquisition of Torah. 60 Idel, \" Tefisat ha-Torah\" 61 See Chapter 7. 62 See von Rad, Wisdom in Israel; Jonathan Z. Smith, \"Wisdom and Apocalyptic.\" 63 See Job 28 and Prov. 8, on which see von Rad, Wisdom in Israel, 144-76. 64 See Stone, \"Lists of Revealed Things.\" 65 See Himmelfarb, \"Tours of Heaven.\" 66 Cf. §544, in which the Sar-Torah hymn serves to introduce the ascent material in Section I; see Swartz, Mystical Prayer, 110; cf. the ascent passages in Merkavah Rabbah §§685-87, discussed above."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"SCHOLASTIC MAGIC 229 SCHOLASTIC MAGIC For the authors of Hekhalot and Sar-Torah literatures, God is the source of Torah, of cosmic secrets, and of the specific techniques that the magi­cian is now using to acquire them. In Ma'aseh Merkavah, this idea finds expression in a poetic prayer that reaches the point of lyricism: May I discourse in the gates of wisdom, and may I examine the ways of understanding, and may I gaze into the chambers of Torah, and may I discourse in the storehouses of blessing, and may they be stored for me. For wisdom is before You. (§569) This prayer reflects a form of piety in which Torah and wisdom, residing in God's abode, are the chief joy of the petitioner. But this wisdom would also bring with it innumerable personal and social advantages. For if the Prince of the Torah were to descend to earth to transform the magician into a great scholar, he would also transform him into a powerful holy man. In talmudic society, the rabbi was known not only as a teacher and judge, but as a wonder-worker whose command of Torah endowed him with extraordinary powers.67 The authors of the Sar-Torah texts appropriated rabbinic values in re­markable ways. They maintained the scholastic virtues of Torah study, rev­erence for the teacher's authority, and emphasis on protocol. But unlike those rabbis whose magical power was said to derive from their mastery of Torah, the practitioners of the Sar-Torah sought to derive mastery of Torah through their magic. 67 On the image of the rabbi as holy man and charismatic figure see Neusner, History, 4 and 5; Robert Kirschner, \"The Vocation of Holiness in Late Antiquity,\" Vigiliae Christianae 38 (1984): 114-19."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"BIBLIOGRAPHY Abusch, I.
