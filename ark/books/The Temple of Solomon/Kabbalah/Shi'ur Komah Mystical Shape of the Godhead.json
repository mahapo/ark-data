[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" I Shi‘ur Komah: THE MYSTICAL SHAPE OF THE GODHEAD I The revolution wrought by biblical monotheism in the history of religionis tied to the imageless worship of God. The prohibition \"Thou shaltmake unto thee no graven image nor any kind of shape\" stands at thebeginning of a new revelation. It is associated with worship that abhorsimages and seeks to evoke the Holy in other ways. However, a questionarises here whose answer is not at all self-evident: is this God, who maynot be worshiped in the image \"of anything that is in heaven or on theearth,\" Himself without image or form? This question forces itself uponthe reader of the Hebrew Bible, as it does upon any human discourseconcerning God. Any discussion of God must necessarily use the imageryof the created world, because we have no other. Anthropomorphism—the application of human language to God—is as intrinsic to the livingspirit of religion as is the feeling that there exists a Divine that far tran-scends such discourse. The human mind cannot escape this tension. In-"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" 16 • ON THE MYSTICAL SHAPE OF THE GODHEAD deed, there is nothing more foolish than attacking and denigrating anthropomorphism—and yet, nothing forces itself more readily upon the sober and reflective consciousness of most theologians. The dialectics are unavoidable: it pertains, not only to the statements that corporealize God Himself, but also (as is often overlooked) to any discussion of the so-called \"word of God\" Benno Jacob, an important commentator on the Jewish Bible, formulated the problem aptly: \" 'God spoke' is no less an anthropomorphism than 'God's hand.'\"1 Of course, the anthropomorphic form of expression, freely used in the imagery of the Torah and the prophets, in hymns and in prayers, may not go beyond the realm of speech; it must not make the leap from the liturgical to the cultic. The question nevertheless remains: Does God, the source of all shape, Himself have a shape? Or more precisely: Under what conditions does He have a shape? What features of God actually appear in the theophanies? The realm of these questions is defined by the terminology of the Bible, which uses two different terms to speak of the shape of God. One term is temunah; the other is tselem. Temunah is derived from the Hebrew root min (\"kind\" or \"species\"). It refers to that which has a shape or is in the process of taking shape. The second commandment uses the term temunah when it forbids the making of the shape of any thing in heaven or on earth for cultic purposes: \"Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, nor any manner of likeness of any thing that is in Heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. Thou shalt not bow down unto them, nor serve them\" (Exod. 20:4). And Deuteronomy (4:12), when recalling the revelation on Mount Sinai, says: \"And the Lord spoke unto you out of the midst of the fire; ye heard the voice of words, but ye saw no form, only a voice. . . .\" It goes on to stress (v. 15): \"Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves—for ye saw no manner of form on the day that the Lord spoke unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire \" This is the basis for the prohibition against using images in worship.Only the voice of God, and no other shape, reaches across the abyss oftranscendence bridged by revelation. Theophany is an act of hearing: themost spiritualized of all sensory perceptions, but a sensory perception"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" SHI‘UR KOMAH: THE MYSTICAL SHAPE OF THE GODHEAD • 17 nevertheless! From here, as we shall see, the road leads to regarding divine speech and the Divine Name as the mystical shape of the Deity. The Bible, however, distinguishes between those images seen by the eye and those perceived through hearing the voice. When the voice of God warns Moses (Exod. 33:20), \"for man shall not see Me and live,\" this does not mean to imply that God is intrinsically devoid of shape—quite the contrary! Indeed, in Numbers (12:8), God says of Moses—whom in the above-quoted passage has been prohibited from seeing Him—\"with him do 1 speak mouth to mouth, even manifestly, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of God2 doth he behold.\" These contradictory state- ments indicate that discussion of the divine form was not meaningless, even if later exegesis attempted to interpret it away. No less strange, in this respect, is the second term, which the Torah(Gen. 1:26-27; 9:6) uses only in connection with the creation of manand which, in a certain sense, is the key term for all anthropomorphicdiscussion of God: tselem ’Elohim. The Hebrew word tselem refers to athree-dimensional image or form. When God says, \"Let us make man inour image (tselem), after our likeness,\" and the following verse says \"in thetselem of God He created him,\" man, as a physical-plastic phenomenon, isplaced in relationship to the primal shape reproduced in him, whateverthat shape might be. God must therefore have something like an \"image\"and \"likeness\" (demuth) of His own. This \"image\" or \"likeness\" is not anobject of cultic veneration, but is something that defines the essence ofman, even in his physicality. This notion of tselem, as the likeness of aheavenly although not necessarily corporeal structure, undergoes all thestages of interpretation and reinterpretation required by the desire for anever-stronger emphasis on divine transcendence and the conception ofGod as pure spirit. It is perhaps relevant to cite here two diametrically opposed views concerning the notion of tselem ’Elohim in Genesis, by two well-known modern exegetes. Hermann Gunkel writes: This similitude refers primarily to man's body, although of course the spiritual is not thereby excluded.

Modern man willprobably object to this explanation by claiming that God has noshape at all, as He is a purely spiritual being. But such an incor-poreal God-idea demands a power of abstraction that was beyondthe reach of ancient Israel, and attained only by Greek philosophy.The Old Testament instead constantly speaks, with great naivete,about God's form. . .. God is thus conceived as a human being,albeit many times more powerful and more dreadful. . . . Yet wealready note another current in Israel during the ancient period:The prophets find it blasphemous to depict God in an image. Godis far too enormous and glorious for any possible image to resembleHim (Isa. 40:25), nor dare we depict Him in words (Isa. 6). Alreadyin the most ancient times, no once could behold His countenance.The more sublime the concept of God became under the influenceof the prophets of Judaism, the more this awe increased.. . . Hence,that era would probably not have brought forth the idea that mancarries the divine form.3 In Benno Jacob's commentary, we find the exact opposite idea: There is no doubt that, throughout the Bible, so far as its leadingminds are speaking, God is a purely spiritual being without bodyor form.. . . The strongest anthropomorphisms are to be found pre-cisely in the words of those orators and prophets who simultaneously,and with the most elan, proclaim God's incomparable sublimity andabsolute spirituality, such as Isaiah and Job. Thus, one can say that,the more spiritual the concept, the more anthropomorphic theexpression, as these figures were concerned, not with philosophicalprecision, but with speaking about a living God. It is not surprising that, for Benno Jacob, Gunkel's above-quoted lines area \"monstrosity,\" refuted by ethnological facts that Gunkel fails to takeinto account: namely, that \"even primitive nations have achieved such an"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" SHI‘UR KOMAH: THE MYSTICAL SHAPE OF THE GODHEAD • 19 abstraction (if it is one)... . Furthermore, this anthropomorphism (i.e., of the \"image of God,\" tselem ’Elohim) is found in P [the Priestly Codex, allegedly the latest written source of the Torah], for whom it would have been most repugnant, according to Gunkel's characterization.\"4 One might say that the vehement opposition between these two pas-sages defines the climate in which our discussion still moves. Both au-thors are to a large extent correct, yet both distort their basic thesisthrough misleading generalizations. Benno Jacob quite properly felt thatanthropomorphism does not exclude the conviction of God's incorpore-ity, but his simultaneous goal of banning discussion on the form of Godis in no wise confirmed by the biblical text. In any event, our own discus-sion below has nothing to do with what the authors of the biblical booksmeant by their utterances about God; the question is rather that of howthese utterances were subsequently understood and what effect they had.In this respect it is obvious that the trend toward the pure spiritualizationof God, as expressed in intertestamental and especially Hellenistic Jewishliterature, is not the only one. It contrasts with another trend that ad-heres with absolute faithfulness to anthropomorphic discourse aboutGod. The Jewish aggadah is the living and most impressive example ofthis mode of discourse, in which the sense of intimacy with the Divine isstill sufficiently powerful for its authors not to flinch from extravagancesthat they knew were not to be taken literally. The metaphorical characterof such utterances, which generally refer to God's activity rather than toHis appearance, is in nearly all cases quite transparent, and is oftenunderscored by the very biblical passages quoted by way of support. Butwe are not concerned here with the aggadic worldview per se. Whatreally concerns us is the following issue: in light of the hostility of rab-binic theology to myths and to imagistic discourse on God, as well as thetendency in Jewish liturgy to limit anthropomorphic depictions of God,why was the problem of Gods' form not eliminated altogether? As againstthe rejection of mythical images in the exoteric realm, which toleratedthese images only as metaphors, there was a renaissance of such imagesin the esoteric, where they were connected with mystical theologicalaxioms. In other words, the mythical images became mystical symbols."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 20 • ON THE MYSTICAL SHAPE OF THE GODHEAD II The development of mysticism in Judaism is linked to speculation con-cerning the first chapter of Ezekiel. Here the prophet describes a visionhe had by the waters of the river Chebar during the Babylonian Exile: hesaw a vision of the divine chariot, the Merkavah, the divine throne builtupon it, and the creatures of the upper world, in animal and human form(who later become categories of angels), who carry it. The elaborate andrather obscure description of the details of the Merkavah was subsequentlytaken up by visionaries in the pre-Christian era, and particularly in thefirst two centuries of the Christian era, who sought to repeat the expe-rience of the vision of the Merkavah. Retaining Ezekiel's terminology,while reinterpreting its meaning, his description was transformed bythem into a depiction of the royal court of the divine majesty. This visionwas revealed to the visionary upon ascent to the highest heaven: origi-nally, perhaps, the third heaven; later, when the number of heavens wasincreased, to the seventh heaven. In apocalyptic literature, descriptionsof the celestial world include descriptions of the world of the divinethrone and the Merkavah. But these same authors become extremely ret-icent when they reach the point of speaking about He who appears onthe throne itself, the figure of the Godhead or its theophany: \"And uponthe likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man uponit above\" (Ezek. 1:26). Isaiah had already seen \"the Lord sitting upon athrone high and lifted up, and His train filled the Temple\" (Isa. 6:1), whileEzekiel describes the light surrounding the figure seated on the throne\"as the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, sowas the appearance of the brightness round about\" (Ezek. 1:28). But forboth prophets what is important is not so much the theophany itself asthe voice that emerges and strikes the prophet's ear. Needless to say, thisvision of the shape of God on the throne, as of the other elements of theMerkavah vision, became an object of contemplation and speculation. Theascent of Merkavah mystics to heaven or, in a different version, to theheavenly paradise, was considered successful if it not only led the mysticto the divine throne but also brought them a revelation of the image ofthe Godhead, the \"Creator of the Universe\" seated on the throne. This"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" SHI‘UR KOMAH: THE MYSTICAL SHAPE OF THE GODHEAD • 21 form was that of the divine Kavod; rendering this word as \"glory\" \"splen- dor\" and the like fails to transmit the true substance of the numinous conception. Kavod refers to that aspect of God that is revealed and mani- fest; the more invisible God becomes for the Jewish consciousness, the more problematical the meaning of this vision of the divine Kavod. We have thus reached the first major topic in our discussion: namely,the manner in which the Jewish Gnostics and Merkavah mystics conceivedof the mystical form of the Godhead: the Shi‘ur Komah. This Hebrew termis often translated as \"measure of height,\" the noun komah being con-strued in its biblical sense as \"height\" or \"stature.\" Such a rendering isvalid, particularly given the appearance of this word in the Song of Songs(which, as we shall see, is closely connected with these speculations).Nevertheless, komah most likely has the precise significance here that ithas in Aramaic, where it quite simply means \"body.\" Indeed, the body ofthe Creator or Demiurge is also called the \"body of the Godhead\" (gufha-Shekhinah), and is described in some highly peculiar fragments thathave survived.5 Some of the oldest texts containing these fragmentsunderstood the anthropomorphisms of the Shi‘ur Komah in terms of de-scriptions of the \"hidden Kavod\" One of these fragments, Hekhaloth Zu-trati, is ascribed, no doubt pseudepigraphically, to Rabbi Akiva, thecentral figure in second-century talmudic Judaism. Akiva is presented asreceiving such visions, saying that God is \"virtually like us, but is greaterthan anything; and this is His glory which is concealed from us\"6 Indeed,the notion of God's concealed glory is virtually identical with the theo-sophic usage found in the oldest known traditions of Merkavah mysticism,which speak of the vision or contemplation of God's glory as the deepestlevel of religious life. Thus, it is rhapsodically promised that, \"Whoeverknows this measure of our Creator and the glory of the Holy One,blessed be He, is promised that he is a son of the World to Come.\"Considering the provocative extravagance of this anthropomorphous de-scription, this promise, uttered here by Rabbi Ishmael and Rabbi Akiva,is extremely paradoxical. Nor should we forget that these men were notonly the two most important rabbinic authorities of the first half of thesecond century, but were also viewed by the tradition of Merkavah mysti-cism as the true heroes of Jewish gnosis. The question emerges: Are we"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 22 • ON THE MYSTICAL SHAPE OF THE GODHEAD dealing here with attempts of later heretical, sectarian groups to givethemselves an Orthodox Jewish appearance? Or are these esoteric tradi-tions authentic ones, taken from the center of rabbinic Judaism in theprocess of its own crystallization? These questions occupied medieval Jewish writers passionately, no lessthan they do modern authors. The bizarre fragments that attempted todescribe and measure the limbs of God's body are, as we have said, pro-vocative in their solemnly arrogant boldness: they were bound either toarouse indignation or to be venerated as repositories of a mystical sym-bolism that was no longer intelligible. The surviving fragments of the Merkavah literature, which are largelyincomprehensible and textually corrupt, are quite clearly related to theSong of Songs. Phrases from this biblical book, particularly the portrayalof the beloved (5:10-16), appear repeatedly in various passages: My beloved is white and ruddy, Pre-eminent above ten thousand. His head is as the most fine gold, His locks are curled, And black as a raven. His eyes are like doves Beside the water-brooks; Washed with milk. And fitly set. His cheeks are a bed of spices. As banks of sweet herbs; His lips are as lilies, Dropping with flowing myrrh. His hands are as rods of gold Set with beryl; His body is as polished ivory Overlaid with sapphires. His legs are as pillars of marble. Set upon sockets of fine gold;"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" SH‘UR KOMAH: THE MYSTICAL SHAPE OF THE GODHEAD • 23 This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem. During the first and second centuries, when the Song of Songs beganto be interpreted as portraying the relationship between God and Israel,tremendous weight was given to the descriptions of the beloved, whowas seen as none other than God Himself, as revealed in the Exodus, inthe splitting of the Red Sea, and in the wanderings in the desert. TheShi‘ur Komah fragments followed these bodily descriptions and even sur-passed them. Enormous measurements are given for the size of the Cre-ator and for the length of each limb. As if this were not enough,unintelligible combinations of letters are given to indicate the secretname of each part. This technique is most probably linked to the sche-matic drawings of human beings found on Greek amulets and magicalpapyri of the same period, covered with secret names. These names,composed of Greek letters, obviously belong to the same cultural sphereas the secret names in the Shi‘ur Komah. As even its oldest extant manu-scripts do not date back beyond the eleventh century, and as the copyistsof such enigmatic fragments no doubt corrupted any number of passages,there seems no hope of finding the key to this secret. Semitic- andGreek-sounding elements are tangled together, so that the Greek seemsmore like an imitation of the sound of Greek words than authenticGreek—just as one might expect from, say, glossolalia. Indeed, perhapsthese names emerged from such ecstatic speaking in tongues. Thus, anytranslation of these passages is virtually doomed. The tremendous dimen-sions make any contemplation illusory; the original goal was presumablya certain numerical harmony among the various measurements, ratherthan a visual image of the individual numbers. The key Biblical verse for this tradition was Psalm 147:5: Gadol ’ado-nenu ve-rav koaḥ—\"Great is our Lord and mighty in strength.\" On thebasis of the numerological computation (gematria) of the phrase ve-ravkoaḥ, this line was interpreted as, \"the size of our Lord is 236.\" The keyfigure in the measurements of the body of the Creator, which appearsrepeatedly, is 236,000,000 parasangs.

From the placeof the seat of His glory [that is, the throne] upward there are 118myriads, and from the place of the seat of His glory downwardthere are 118 myriads. His height is 236 myriad thousand leagues.From His right arm to His left arm there are 77 myriads. From theright eyeball to the left eyeball there are 30 myriads. His craniumis three and one third myriads. The crowns on His head are sixtymyriads, corresponding to the sixty myriads of the heads of Israel.8 This last sentence refers to an aggadic conception (as we find repeatedlyin these fragments): the image of Sandalphon, the angel appointed overthe prayers of Israel, who is a 500-years-walk tall. Thus, every individualin Israel who calls upon God in prayer places a crown on His head, forprayer is an act of crowning God and recognizing Him as king.9 These texts exude a sense of the world beyond; a numinous feelingemanates even from these enormous, seemingly blasphemous numbersand from the monstrous series of names. God's majesty and holiness, theform of the celestial king and Creator, assume physical shape in thesenumerical proportions. What moved these mystics was not the spiritual-ity of His being, but the majesty of His theophany.

His body is likechrysolite, his brilliance breaks tremendously out of the darkness,clouds and mist surround him, all the archeons and seraphim vanishbefore him like a drained pitcher. That is why we have no mea-surement, and only names are revealed to us.11 Indeed, this ancient author is very chary with numbers, but all the moregenerous in listing the secret names of these parts in the \"language ofpurity\"12—that is, an esoteric language of the pure names. However, the \"language of the pure name,\" in which the mystical formof the Deity in its concealed glory is revealed to the initiate, allows us torecognize a connection between this aspect of Jewish Merkavah specula-tion found in the Shi‘ur Komah and one of the most puzzling forms ofsecond-century gnosis. The Gnostic teachings of Marcus, a disciple ofValentinus, had always been distasteful to scholars of Gnosticism becauseof the affinity between his teachings and the linguistic mysticism andletter symbolism of the Kabbalah.13 Indeed, the point of departure for histeaching is a mingling of linguistic mysticism and Shi‘ur Komah notions.Despite the Christian interpretation of these ideas, the mixture pointsunmistakably to their origin in Jewish esoterism—a point first noted byMoses Gaster nearly a century ago.14 The Greek form in which thesespeculations are transmitted is merely Marcus's adaptation of Semiticspeculations, a point confirmed by the fact that the ritual formulae heemployed in his mystical liturgy are indisputably Aramaic. The native soilof his gnosis was not Egypt, but Palestine or Syria, where he must havebecome acquainted with the oldest forms of Shi‘ur Komah imagery. The Merkavah mystics receive their revelation while rising to the throne, while Marcus received his when the supreme Tetras \"descended to him from invisible and unrecognizable places in the guise of a woman,"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" SHI‘UR KOMAH: THE MYSTICAL SHAPE OF THE GODHEAD•27 into its elements, Marcus receives the revelation of Truth itself from hisfemale guide. \"For I brought [Truth] down from her supernal dwelling,that you might see her nude and come to know her beauty, but also tohear her speak and to admire her understanding.\" There follows a list ofthe parts of this mystical form, from head to foot, and of their secretnames, each of which are nothing but combinations of the first and lastletter of the alphabet, the second and penultimate, and so on in this order[the system known in Hebrew as ’atbash], Thus, for Marcus, the alphabetas a whole constitutes the mystical shape of Truth, which he—quite inkeeping with the Jewish terminology of the \"body of the Shekhinah\"—calls the \"body of truth\" (σῶμα τῆς αληθείας), and the form of theprimeval, which, for him, is the primal human being, the Anthropos.\"Here is the source of every word, the origin of every voice, the utter-ance of all that is unutterable, and the mouth of dumb silence.\" We find in Marcus that the description of the origins of the mystical form of the primal human being is connected with language mysticism and a doctrine of secret names and letter combinations—much as we have found in the strictly Jewish, or more correctly Jewish-Gnostic, Shi‘ur Komah fragment. Marcus's theory of language can also aid us in understanding and interpreting the Jewish text. The notion of the letters of God's name as aeons is also a later Kabbalistic teaching. The secret names of the organs are combinations, into which the basic elements of the Primal Man, which is the great Name of God, subdivide. What Mar- cus refers to as the primal human being corresponds, in Shi‘ur Komah, to the human form seen by Ezekiel on the throne. The doctrine of the Shi‘ur Komah contains both a teaching of the name of the Creator—which is a configuration representing God's ungraspable, shapeless existence—and of the sensory shape in which the Creator appeared to Israel as a hand- some youth by the Red Sea, and in which He reveals himself to devotees of Merkavah mysticism at the end of the journey of the ascending soul. Marcus could therefore have received this teaching concerning the infi- nite power and depth of the letters from contemporary Jewish tradition, not just from the neo-Pythagorean tradition with which scholars used to link these speculations. In so doing they overlooked precisely those ele- ments lacking in the neo-Pythagorean, but present in the Jewish Shi‘ur"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 28 • ON THE MYSTICAL SHAPE OF THE GODHEAD Komah tradition. In my opinion Marcus was acquainted with both tradi- tions and synthesized them. The Sh‘ur Komah literature and that variant of this teaching that Marcus adapted to his purposes mutually illuminate one another. Perhaps it should also be noted that the mystical-magical character of the alphabet sequence, in the specific form mentioned above [i.e., ’atbash], is familiar to the Jewish tradition. In fact, a Greek-Hebrew amulet discovered in Karneol in 1940 contains on the Greek obverse an apostrophe to God, \"Thou Heaven-Shaped, Sea-Shaped, Darkness- Shaped, and All-Shaped (pamomorphos), the Ineffable before whom myri- ads of angels prostrate themselves,\" while on the verso of the amulet the Hebrew alphabet appears, in ’atbash sequence, as the secret name of God.16 This sequence is transcribed into Greek on the Greek side of the amulet! We may therefore assume that the Deity has a mystical form thatmanifests itself in two different aspects: to the visionary, it manifests itselfin the tangible shape of a human being seated on the throne of glory,constituting the supreme primal image in which man was created; aur-ally, at least in principle, it is manifested as God's name, broken into itscomponent elements, whose structure anticipates that of all being. Ac-cording to this doctrine, God's shape is conceived of, not as a concept oridea, but as names. This interlocking of tactile and linguistic anthropo-morphism, which I consider characteristic of Sh‘ur Komah doctrine, per-vades the extant fragments. Hence, it is not surprising to see a sentencesuch as: \"God sits on a throne of fire, and all around Him, like columnsof fire, are the ineffable names.\"17 The two realms are not separated, andthe names of God, which are the hidden life of the entire Creation, arenot only audible, but also visible as letters of fire. Furthermore, accordingto an aggadah attributed to the Palestinian Merkavah mystics of the earlythird century, \"The Torah given by the Holy One, blessed be He, toMoses was given to him in [the form of] white fire inscribed upon blackfire—fire mixed with fire, hewn out of fire and given from fire. Of thisit is written, 'at His right hand was a fiery law unto them' [Deut. 33:2]\"18The Torah occupies here the same place as is occupied in Valentinus's andMarcus's gnosis by the already Christianized logos, the primal name ofGod that constitutes the form of everything."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" SH‘UR KOMAH: THE MYSTICAL SHAPE OF THE GODHEAD • 29 There thus exists a \"body\" of the divine Kavod which, as we have seen,was a symbol that was revealed to the mystics. Even the most tangibleanthropomorphisms bespeak a language of mysteries.19 Just as there is amystical body of God in which His image appears, so is there a garment(ḥaluk) in which this body is wrapped. This garment is described, notonly in the aggadah, but even more in the hymns of the Merkavah mystics,some of which are extant from the third century. According to one ofthese hymns, the heavens were radiated from this mystical \"shape\"; ac-cording to another, \"constellations and stars and signs emanate from Hisgarment, in which he wraps Himself and sits upon the throne of glory.\"In yet another midrash (which makes use of the technical language foundin these hymns), it is related that God opened the seven heavens on Sinaiand revealed himself to Israel, \"in His beauty, His glory, His shape, Hiscrown, and upon the throne of His glory\" (the throne here replaces thegarment mentioned in the hymns). It is obvious that this midrash findsnothing wrong with these notions from the sphere of the Shi‘ur Komahdoctrine.20 In the above discussion I have assumed the doctrine of God's form to be extremely ancient, hence one that could have been adopted in Gnostic circles that were joined by early Jewish converts to Christianity. This assumption is strengthened by an extremely interesting passage in the Slavonic Book of Enoch which, unlike the view of André Vaillant (the most recent scholarly editor, whose arguments on this score are quite weak), I cannot ascribe to a Christian author. Rather, I see it as a Jewish apocalypse written in Palestine or Egypt during the first century C.E. The Greek original has been lost, but it evidently used the term μορφῆ in the sense of \"stature\" or \"form.\" In chapter 13 of this book, Enoch says: \"You see the extent of my body (shi‘ur komati) similar to yours, and I saw the extent of the Lord without measure and without image and without end.\" Abraham Kahana's Hebrew translation (in his edition of the Apoc- rypha) made use of this term, without his being aware of the possibility that the term shi‘ur komah in fact goes back to this period. The parallel between the contents of the Hebrew Shi‘ur Komah and the Book of Enoch is striking and thought-provoking. Similar images of God, as possessing a \"form\" or bodily shape,"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 30 • ON THE MYSTICAL SHAPE OF THE GODHEAD μορφὴ, were certainly known to Jewish-Christian groups and are as-sumed in the sources of the pseudo-Clementine Homilies, some of whichmay have come from the Jewish-Christian Ebionite sect. Here too, espe-cially in the seventeenth homily, the \"beauty\" of the father is emphasizedand the parts of his body are described, as in the above-mentioned Shi‘urKomah hymns. The seventeenth homily emphasizes (again, like one of thefragments I quoted earlier) that this body is \"incomparably more lumi-nous than the spirit with which we perceive it, and is more radiant thananything else, so that in comparison with this body, the light of the sunmust be regarded as darkness.\"21 All this suggests a connection with theJewish Gnostic fragments extant in the Hebrew and Aramaic texts of theShi‘ur Komah. This early dating, however, was by no means undisputed. The fewnineteenth-century scholars who dealt with these concepts, above allHeinrich Graetz, committed the grave error of dating the Merkavah liter-ature far too late; its intimate and multiple connections with Gnosticliterature and the syncretistic papyri therefore eluded them. Scholarsdated those writings between the seventh and ninth centuries, tracingthe anthropomorphisms of the Shi‘ur Komah to the influence of an Islamicanthropomorphic school, the Mushabbiha, when in fact the exact oppositewas the case.22 According to this approach, these Jewish doctrines origi-nated among ignorant groups who were given to grossly sensual ideas,and were quite unknown to the Merkavah mystics of the tannaitic periodattested to by the Talmud. The progress made in understanding and care-ful study of these texts has made such views untenable. Over and above everything said above, there is extremely important,albeit indirect, evidence regarding the age of the Shi‘ur Komah traditionconnected to the Song of Songs. This evidence appears in a passage byOrigen that has never been satisfactorily explicated. In the introductionto his well-known commentary on the Song of Songs—in which theJewish reading, i.e., in terms of the relationship between God and Israel,is replaced by that between Christ and the Church—Origen writes: It is said to be the custom of the Jews to forbid anyone who hasnot attained a mature age to hold this book [i.e., the Song of Songs]"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" SHI‘UR KOMAH: THE MYSTICAL SHAPE OF THE GODHEAD • 31 in his hands. Moreover, even though their rabbis and teachers in-struct their children in all the books of the Scripture and in theiroral traditions,25 they postpone the following four texts until thevery end: the beginning of Genesis, describing the Creation of theWorld; the beginning of the prophecy of Ezekiel, which relates tothe cherubim [that is, the doctrine of the angels and the divineretinue]: the end [of the same book], which describes the futureTemple; and this book, the Song of Songs.24 There can be no doubt that this passage refers to the existence ofesoteric doctrines connected with the four texts mentioned. We knowfrom the Mishnah that the beginning of Genesis and the first chapter ofEzekiel were considered to be esoteric texts par excellence, and it wastherefore prohibited to lecture about them in public. They could be stud-ied privately, but even then only by those who were worthy, mature, andheld in esteem by their fellow citizens.25 The reference to the concludingchapters of Ezekiel is presumably related to the association of these chap-ters with apocalyptic ideas concerning the rebuilding of the Temple. Thefact that many details in these chapters openly contradict the Torah'sdescription of the same subject also naturally led to limitations upontheir study. Indeed, there was a tendency during the first century toexclude the Book of Ezekiel from the canon of biblical Scriptures becauseof these very contradictions.26 It may be that the contradictions betweenthese two sources were resolved among certain groups by means of somekind of esoteric teachings, although we have no definite information onthis matter. On the other hand, we know nothing about restrictions on the study of the Song of Songs. In fact, during the second and third centuries, the allegorical reading of this book in terms of the love between God and the Congregation of Israel was a favorite theme in the aggadic lectures of the rabbis. True, according to later testimonies, the Song of Songs was deemed unsuitable for public study because the servant—that is, the Christian Church—had usurped the place of the mistress—that is, the Synagogue. It has been justifiably argued that this would indicate that during the third century the Church allegorically reinterpreted the Song"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 32 • ON THE MYSTICAL SHAPE OF THE GODHEAD of Songs in its own interests.\" However, the state of affairs with whichOrigen was already familiar in the early third century (and we must notforget that he worked in the town of Caesarea in Palestine and was wellacquainted with the Jewish tradition)—namely, that of an older Jewishtradition—cannot be explained in terms of this polemic. Jewish scholarsprior to Origen's time could not possibly have known about a Christolog-ical reading of the Song of Songs that would arouse their qualms aboutpublic study of this book for a simple reason: this reading first enteralinto the Church through Origen's own commentary on it.28 Thus, theJewish sages of the second or early third century would hardly havelimited the study of a book due to a reinterpretation which they couldonly have known later. The true basis for Origen's tradition lies in the fact that during thesecond century the Song of Songs was connected with the esoteric doc-trine of Shi‘ur Komah, Whether it originated from its interpretation orhad earlier sources, the Song of Songs functioned as the biblical textupon which this doctrine was based. The Merkavah mystics most likelyregarded the Song of Songs not only as an historical allegory within theframework of its aggadic interpretation but also as an esoteric text in thestrict sense—i.e., as a text containing sublime mysteries, not universallyaccessible, concerning the manifestation and form of God in terms of thesecrets of the Merkabah. The most profound of all the chapters of Mer-kabah mysticism is that concerning the shape of the Deity (extant in theSh‘ur Komah fragments), which speaks not only about the Merkabah perse, but, as we read in Hekhaloth Zutrati, \"the Great and Mighty, Awesome,Enormous and Strong God, who is removed from the sight of all crea-tures and hidden from the ministering angels, but was revealed to RabbiAkiva in the vision of the Merkavah, to do his will\"29 As Saul Liebermanhas cogently shown, it can be demonstrated that the second-centurytannaim saw the Song of Songs in terms of a Merkavah revelation thatoccurred at the Red Sea and on Mount Sinai—a point made in a numberof midrashim.30 This conclusively proves the age of the Sh‘ur Komah idea,as I have already suggested on the basis of more general considerations.Origen's passage confirms that in his day, and probably some time before"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" SH‘UR KOMAH: THE MYSTICAL SHAPE OF THE GODHEAD • 33 him, the Jewish teachers in Palestine viewed the Song of Songs as an esoteric text concerning the manifestations and form of the Deity. One might even go further, and join Gaster in conjecturing that the prohibi- tion against public study of the Merkavah, a prohibition already operating in the first century, was primarily directed against the Shi‘ur Komah doc- trine.31 This dating of the Shi‘ur Komah is supported by a statement of St. Justin Martyr (Dialogue with Tryphon, chap. 114) that, according to certain Jewish teachings, God has human shape and organs. This statement can be adequately explained by a proper dating of the Shi‘ur Komah specula- tion. He presents these teachings not as heretical ideas but as the nor- mative rabbinic teaching of his time. It is hence quite understandable that such notions penetrated, with some variation, even into Ebionite circles. We may perhaps go even one step further. Mandaean writings fre-quently contain the designation of God as Mara de-Rabutha (the Lord ofGreatness), referring to Uthras, the father of all celestial potencies.Scholars have thus far been unable to identify the origin of this term. Itnow appears that this designation, like so much else in Mandaean Gnos-ticism, derives from Judaism. The identical wording appears (strangelyenough, unnoticed by scholars) in a fragment of an Aramaic paraphraseof Genesis discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls at Qumran, publishedin 1 9 5 7 ; the text comes roughly from the first century B.C.E. There (col.I I , line 4), Noah's father, Lamech, speaks to his wife about the \"Mararabutha, the king of all worlds.\" This name is used quite naturally, as oneobviously taken for granted i n these circles. If the Mandaeans were orig-inally connected with Jewish baptismal sects near the Jordan (as manyscholars tend to assume on the basis of their literature), then we aredealing here with the origins of a religious term that was first used inthose circles and then moved eastward together with the early Mandaeangroups. It is difficult to ascertain the exact image underlying this term.The \"Lord of Greatness\" may refer to He who possesses the attribute ofgreatness i n an abstract sense, in which case it would hearken back toDavid's prayer i n I Chronicles 2 9 : 1 1 . \"Thine, O Lord, is the greatness,and the power, etc.\" Indeed, in the Hebrew texts of Merkavah Gnosticism"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 34 • ON THE MYSTICAL SHAPE OF THE GODHEAD we find a parallel name for God as \"Lord of Strength.\"32 However, thismay also be a further development along the lines of the Shi‘ur Komah,which, as we have seen, concretely depicts the greatness of the \"Lord ofGreatness.\" In this context the key verse that we have already discussed,Psalm 147:5, is particularly suggestive: the \"greatness of our Lord\" (asthe verse was construed here) is alluded to in the words ve-rav koaḥ. Wethus find both the Hebrew word for \"great\" (gadol) and the Aramaic rab,contained in the term Mara Rabutha. Perhaps the choice of this verseand its mystical, numerological interpretation as referring to the spe-cific measurement of God's dimension are based precisely on this titleof God. An important conclusion of our discussion is not merely the fact ofthe existence of such images as that of a shape of God in ancient Jewishesoterism, but also the fact that we are not dealing here with the ideasof \"heretical\" groups on the periphery of rabbinic Judaism. On thecontrary: The close link between these ideas and Merkavah mysticism canleave no doubt that the bearers of these speculations were at the verycenter of rabbinic Judaism in tannaitic and talmudic times. We mustrevise forward many of the assumptions of earlier scholars who, findingthis notion unacceptable a priori, attempted to relegate the Shi‘ur Komahto the fringes of Judaism. The gnosis we are dealing with here is a strictlyorthodox Jewish one. The subject of these speculations and visions—Yotser Bereshith, the God of Creation—is not some lowly figure such asthose found in some heretical sects, similar to the Demiurge of manyGnostic doctrines, which drew a contrast between the true God and theGod of Creation. In the view of the Shi‘ur Komah, the Creator God isidentical with the authentic God of monotheism, in His mystical form;there is no possibility here of dualism. Given the antiquity of these ideas,which we have tentatively traced back to the first century, we may askwhether this orthodox Shi‘ur Komah gnosis did not precede the dualisticconception of later Gnosticism, which emerged during the early secondcentury. If so, the entire line of Gnostic development from monotheismto dualism must be understood in an entirely different way from thatwhich scholars have thus far suggested. We likewise cannot ignore thepossibility that the pronounced usage of the term Yotser Bereshith (De-"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" SHI‘UR KOMAH: THE MYSTICAL SHAPE OF THE GODHEAD • 35 miurge) in those fragments (the oldest of which probably go back to the second or third century) might have been introduced in order to indicate the monotheistic alternative to the position of these sectarians—in other words, with a polemical aim against certain Gnostic groups in Judaism who had been exposed to the influence of dualistic ideas, which they tried to apply in heretical, Gnostic interpretations of the Bible. In any event, these or similar traditions were preserved in Palestinian Judaism and its aggadah. As late as the sixth century, the most important liturgical poet of Palestinian Jewry, Eleazar ha-Kallir, used the terms Shi‘ur Komah and Yotser Bereshit!) as perfectly acceptable, rather than he- retical, concepts.33 In the ninth century, when the Karaites began their vehement attacks upon the talmudic aggadah and its anthropomorph- isms, the burden of their polemic was aimed against the Shi‘ur Komah fragments, which both enjoyed ancient authority and were already re- puted to be completely unintelligible.34 However, the spokesmen of rab- binic Judaism in the Babylonian academics initially adhered to their tradition, and were unwilling to abandon even such extravagant lucubra- tions of the aggadic spirit as the Shi‘ur Komah. However, there were great figures who were not prepared to defend this tradition. Around the year 1000, Jewish scholars in Fez sent an inquiry concern- ing the Shi‘ur Komah to Rav Sherira Gaon. head of the Babylonian acad- emy. Among other things, they wrote: And R. Ishmael said further: \"I and R. Akiva are guarantors, thatwhoever knows the stature of our Creator and the praise of theHoly One, blessed be He, is assured a share in the World to Come,provided only that he repeat it in the Mishnah every day.\" And hebegan to say, \"His stature is thus and such...\" And we wish toknow whether Rabbi Ishmael said what he said from his teacher,who heard it from ins teacher, and so on going back to Moses atSinai, or whether he said it of his own accord. And if he said it ofhis own accord, should one not apply the Mishnah (Ḥagigah 2:1):\"If a man does not consider the honor of his Creator, it were betterhad he never been born.\" May our master explain this to us clearlyand fully."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 36 • ON THE MYSTICAL SHAPE OF THE GODHEAD R. Sherira replied: It is impossible to explain this matter clearly and in full; it can only be done quite generally. Heaven forbid that Rabbi Ishmael should have invented such things out of his own head: how could a man arrive at such utterances of his own accord? Moreover, our Creator is too high and sublime to have organs and measurements in the literal sense, for, \"To whom then will ye liken God? Or what like- ness will ye compare unto Him?\" (Isa. 49:18). Rather, these are words of wisdom that cannot be conveyed to everyone. Other versions of this responsum contain even sharper language: There are hidden therein profound reasons, which are higher than the highest mountains and exceedingly wondrous, and their allu- sions and secrets and mysteries and hidden things cannot be con- veyed to every one.35 In other words, the secrets of the Shi‘ur Komah themselves allude to pro- found mysteries. R. Sherira thus has an opinion concerning this issue, but is not prepared to commit it to writing. Indeed, three generations earlier, Saadiah Gaon, under the impact of the Karaite polemic, held a far more reserved position: There is no agreement among scholars about Shi‘ur Komah, for itappears neither in the Mishnah nor in the Talmud, and we have noway of determining whether or not it comes from Rabbi Ishmael,or whether someone else composed it under his name. For thereare many books which use the name of people who did not writethem, but were composed by others who made use of the name ofone of the great sages in order to attain prominence for theirbooks.36 Maimonides expressed himself in more extreme fashion. During his youth, he still considered Shi‘ur Komah as a source deserving of interpre- tation, but he subsequently changed his mind, and could only view these"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" SHI‘UR KOMAH: THE MYSTICAL SHAPE OF THE GODHEAD • 37 texts with horror. When asked whether it was a Karaite work or whetherit contained \"mysteries of our Sages, of blessed memory, concealing pro-found matters of physics or metaphysics, as Rabbenu Hai stated,\" Mai-monides replied: I never thought that this came from the Sages. Heaven forbid ourassuming that this kind of thing derives from their hands! Rather,it is undoubtably no more than the work of a Byzantine preacher.All in all, it would be a highly meritorious deed to snuff out thisbook and to destroy all memory of it.37 These words indicate the embarrassment felt by Jewish rationalists upon being confronted with a text of this type. Some, of course, attempted to salvage it by means of philosophical, allegorical interpretation—as, for instance, Moses of Narbonne (d. 1362),38 or R. Simeon ben Tsemah Duran (14th c). The latter explicitly challenges a certain opinion that seems to have been widespread during the Middle Ages, even by several Kabbalists: namely, that the measurements of the Shi‘ur Komah refer to the highest archons among the angels or to angelic beings. Rather, ac- cording to Duran, \"the aim of this book is to maintain that everything in existence is God's Glory, and that their measurements [i.e., that of the organs] is so and so much; or else they referred to the dimensions of the Kavod as it appeared to the prophets.\"39 According to Duran, Shi‘ur Ko- mah may be interpreted in a visionary manner (which is not far from the literal truth) or in a pantheistic interpretation which asserts that reality itself as a whole is the mystical shape of the deity. A far-reaching thesis is thus concealed here in mythical images.40 In any event, the Shi‘ur Komah was not an object of reverent study for these medieval Jewish groups; rather, as I have said, it was an embarrassment.

Medieval theology had already forgotten the original significance of the Shi‘ur Komah vision, and was hard set on abol- ishing any view that attributed to God any human attributes whatever. These philosophers sought to push the biblical concept of monotheism to its utmost extreme, and even outdid the Bible itself in removing any vestiges therein of mythical or anthropomorphic parlance. It is no coin- cidence that Maimonides began his philosophical magnum opus, Guide for the Perplexed, by turning the key word tselem on its head—although, in his opinion, of course, right side up. In the newly evolving Kabbalah, by contrast, we find the oppositetendency. Here, too, the spiritualization of the idea of God is an acceptedfact, but in the reflections that took the place of the Merkavah visions, theancient images reemerged, albeit now with a symbolic character. Unlikethe philosophers, the Kabbalists were not ashamed of these images; onthe contrary, they saw in them the repositories of divine mysteries. Shi‘urKomah became the watchword of a new attitude, which was no longerinterested in the details of the ancient fragments—neither those of themeasurements and numbers, nor of the enigmatic names, all of whichwere consigned to obscurity. In their place the Kabbalists returned, intheir own way and with their own emphases, to the fundamental idea ofa mystical form of the Godhead. The underlying principle might be for-mulated as follows: ’Ein-Sof, the Infinite—that is, the concealed God-head—dwells unknowable in the depth of its own being, without formor shape. It is beyond all cognitive statements, and can only be describedthrough negation—indeed, as the negation of all negations. No imagescan depict it, nor can it be named by any name. By contrast, the ActiveDivinity has a mystical shape which can be conveyed by images andnames. To be sure, it is no longer a potential object of vision, as in Mer-kavah mysticism; the stature and value of such visions become greatlydiminished. Prophetic visions are mediated by infinite levels of theophanyoriginating in deeper regions, which are below the sphere with which theKabbalists are dealing. However, the Godhead also manifests itself insymbols: in the symbol of the organically growing shape of the tree, inthe symbol of the human form, and in symbols of the names of God."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" SH‘UR KOMAH: THE MYSTICAL SHAPE OF THE GODHEAD • 39 Both tendencies, which we have already encountered in the ancient Shi‘urKomah texts and in Marcean Gnosticism, emerge with renewed strengthfrom the Kabbalistic sense of the world, albeit in altered form. The Kab-balists found it an honor, rather than an embarrassment, to speak aboutthe Shi‘ur Komah. Often enough, they paraded their own theologia mysticaas the doctrine of the Shi‘ur Komah, in proud defiance and mocking scornof the stutterings of the apologists. It is no coincidence that one of theboldest and deepest writings of the later Kabbalah, Shi‘ur Komah of R.Moses Cordovero of Safed (the most profound speculative mystic of theKabbalah), bore the same title as that ancient work. In His active manifestations, the Godhead appears as the dynamicunity of the Sefiroth, portrayed as the \"tree of the Sefiroth,\" or the mysticalhuman form (’Adam Kadmon), who is none other than the concealed shapeof the Godhead itself. Let me briefly recapitulate what the Kabbalistsmean by Sefiroth. These were originally the ten primal numbers in whichall reality is rooted—an idea expounded in a Hebrew text roughly con-temporary with the ancient Shi‘ur Komah and heavily influenced by Py-thagoreanism: Sefer Yetsirah (The Book of Creation). However, themedieval Kabbalists changed its meaning when they adopted the termSefiroth. For them the Sefiroth are the potencies constituting the activeGodhead, and through which (to use Kabbalistic language) it acquires its\"face.\" ’Anpin Penima’in, the hidden face of God, is the aspect of the divinelife turned toward us which, despite its concealment, seeks to take onshape. The divine life is expressed in ten steps or levels, which bothconceal and reveal Him. It flows out and animates Creation; but at thesame time it remains deep inside. The secret rhythm of its movementand pulse beat is the law of motion of all Creation. As the divine lifereveals itself—that is, becomes manifest through its actions on the vari-ous levels of divine emanation—it assumes a different shape on eachlevel or, speaking theologically, appears in different attributes. In its to-tality the individual elements of the life process of God are unfolded yetconstitute a unity (the unity of God revealing Himself); together they arethe shape of the Godhead. The plasticity of its being—which radiates in all directions and mani-"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 40 • ON THE MYSTICAL SHAPE OF THE GODHEAD fests the infinite goodness of God—is revealed in its manifold functions. Abraham Herrera, in his book Sha‘ar ha-Shamayim (ca. 1620), describes the various aspects of the Sefiroth as follows: The Sefiroth are emanations from the primal simple unity; makingknown His good which is without end; mirrors of His truth, whichshare in his nature and essence, which is above all, and that He isHimself the necessary being; structures of his wisdom and repre-sentations of His will and desire; receptacles of His strength andinstruments of His activity; treasuries of His bliss and distributorsof His grace and goodness; judges of His kingdom, bringing Hisjudgment to light; and simultaneously the designations, attributes,and names of He who is the highest of all and who encompassesall. These ten names are inextinguishable: ten attributes of His sub-lime glory and greatness; ten fingers of His mighty hands, five ofHis right and five of His left; ten lights by which He radiates Him-self; ten garments of glory, in which He is garbed; ten visions, inwhich He is seen; ten forms, in which He has formed everything;ten sanctuaries, in which He is exalted; ten degrees of prophecy, inwhich He manifests Himself; ten lecterns, from which He teaches;ten thrones, from which He judges the nations; ten divisions ofparadise or canopies for those who are deserving of it; ten steps onwhich He descends, and ten on which one ascends to Him; tenbeauteous fields, producing all influx and blessing; ten boundaries,which all yearn for but only the righteous attain; ten lights, whichilluminate all intelligences; ten kinds of fire, which consume alldesires; ten kinds of glory, which rejoice all rational souls and in-tellects; ten words, by which the world was created; ten spirits, bywhich the world is moved and kept alive; ten commandments; tennumbers, dimensions, and weights, by which all is counted,weighed, and measured; ten touchstones, by which the perfectionof all things is tested, by that which are drawn near and are repelledby them. And these are the ten utterances containing All; the generain whose bosom everything is contained and from whose bosomeverything emerges; the providence which extends from one ex-treme to the other, and by the awesomeness of whose providence"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" SHI‘UR KOMAH: THE MYSTICAL SHAPE OF THE GODHEAD • 41 all is prepared for their good and their benefit.... The supremeunities, to whom all the initial multiplicities return, by its inter-mediacy, to the simple unity; and above all the simple unities is theInfinite, blessed be He.41 Of course, even this turning toward created beings contains the inef- fable that accompanies every expression, enters into it and withdraws from it. The awareness of this dual quality, this dialectic of manifestation within shape, is characteristic of the Kabbalist's knowledge of divine mat- ters—a knowledge that was experienced in many ways. For example, the Tikkunei Zohar points out that God dwells both in the Sefiroth and between them: You are within all and outside of all, and to every side, and above all and beneath all. . . . And You are in every Sefirah, in its length and breadth and above it and below it, and between each and every Sefirah and in the thickness of the every Sefirah.42 The most precise formulation of this concept is in the writings of R. Moses Cordovero: The Infinite, the King, King of Kings, who rules all: for His essencepenetrates and descends via the Sefiroth and between the Sefiroth,and between the Merkavah and within the Merkabah, and within theangels and between the angels, and within the celestial spheres andbetween the celestial spheres, and within the elements and betweenthe lowly elements, and within the land and between the land andits offspring, down to the final point of the abyss—the whole worldis full of His glory.43 In other words, the formless substance of the ’Ein-Sof is immediatelypresent, in its full reality, in all stages of the process of emanation andcreation, and in every imaginable shape. In this sense one may say thatthere is no thoroughly shaped image that can completely detach itselffrom the depths of the formless: this insight is crucial for the metaphysics"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 42 • ON THE MYSTICAL SHAPE OF THE GODHEAD of the Kabbalah. The truer the form, the more powerful the life of the formless within it. To delve into the abyss of formlessness is no less ab- surd an undertaking for the Kabbalists than to ascend to the form itself; the mystical nihilism that destroys any shape dwells hand in hand with the prudent moderation struggling to comprehend the shape. One might say that both tendencies are peering out of the same shell. It is precisely in the doctrine of the Sefiroth, with its emphasis on the mystical shape which lies at the basis of every other shape, that the Kabbalist becomes aware of this danger, and tries to overcome it. The Divine is not only the shapeless abyss into which everything sinks, although it is that abyss too. In its turning toward the outside, it contains the guarantee of the exis- tence of form—precarious and elusive by nature, but no less powerful for that. This comment is perhaps not superfluous in terms of the thought processes we are dealing with here. But let us return to our point of departure: God's potencies grow intoCreation like a tree, nourished by the waters of divine wisdom.44 TheSefirotic tree, of which the Kabbalists spoke in Sefer ha-Bahir, preservesthe image of the organic shape in which each thing is in its proper place,and where it partakes of the flow directed toward it from the union ofthe totality. The Sefirotic tree, in which God has implanted His strength(\"the cedars of Lebanon which He hath planted,\" to quote one widelyused exegesis), is also the Tree of the World and, in a certain sense, thetrue Tree of Life. Its root is located in the highest Sefiroth; its trunkembraces the central and thereby conciliating forces; while the branchesor limbs which grow out of it at various points encompass the contradic-tory forces of divine activity in Ḥesed and Din. All of these taken togetherconstitute the primary form in which the divine image appears in theKabbalah. The tree grows upside down—an image familiar to us frommany myths. The three uppermost Sefiroth—Keter (crown) or, in the Zo-har, Ratson (will); Ḥokhmah (wisdom); and Binah (insight or discern-ment)—are the basic ground and roots of this tree. It is no coincidencethat these determining forces are from the world of the intellect. In thenext three Sefiroth, we find Ḥesed (grace or love), Din or Gevurah (severityor judgment), and Raḥamim or Tif’ereth (mercy, also known as splendor orbeauty), in which the extremes are united and conciliated. Again, it is no"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" SHI‘UR KOMAH: THE MYSTICAL SHAPE OF THE GODHEAD •43 coincidence that this sphere is defined by moral forces. The last triad consists of Netsaḥ (endurance), Hod (splendor or majesty), and Yesod (the foundation) or Tsaddik (the Righteous One). This completes the picture of the creative forces, enabling them to operate together through the living force of God, by which everything finds its place and is maintained. As the living force par excellence, it is likewise the force of procreation, represented through symbols of male sexuality. All these active factors are in turn united in the tenth Sefirah, Malkhuth or Shekhinah, God's royal rule, into which they flow as into the ocean. The living forces of the Godhead pass into Creation through the medium of the last Sefirah, rep- resented in symbols of receptivity and femaleness.45 We thus arrive at a fixed canonic image of the Sefirotic tree, represented as shown on page 44. While the image of the Sefirotic tree is represented in other struc-tures, this one is the most widespread. The Sefiroth are thus not a seriesof ten emanations of aeons emerging from one another; on the contrary,they constitute a well-structured form, in which every part or limb op-erates upon every other, and not just the higher ones on the lower. TheSefiroth are connected with one another by means of secret \"channels,\"tsinoroth, whereby each radiates into the other and in which the other isin turn reflected. The specific nature of each potency is deeply rooted initself, but every potency likewise contains some aspects of all the others.Moreover, each one repeats in itself the structure of the whole, and so onad infinitum—a point elaborated by the later Kabbalah. It is through thisprocess of infinite reflection that the whole is reflected in every memberand thus, as Moses Cordovero explained, becomes a whole.46 However, the Sefiroth do not appear only in the shape of the tree.They also appear in the form of Primal Man (’Adam Kadmon), which cor-responds to that of earthly man. The Sefiroth are the \"holy forms,\" firstmentioned in Sefer ha-Bahir, in which these two symbolic representationsappear one after another. In S §112 (M §166) the date palm is cited as asymbol of the procreative power of the Godhead, exactly as in the Man-daean writings. The \"seventy palms\" found by the Israelites at Elim(Exod. 15:27) during their wandering in the desert, indicate that \"Godhas seventy shapes,\" and every palm tree corresponds to one of these"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 44 • ON THE MYSTICAL SHAPE OF THE GODHEAD primal shapes. The Hebrew term komah, used here for \"shape\" is thesame as that used in Sh‘ur Komah. However, in S §§114 and 116 (M§§165, 172), the organs of man correspond to the \"seven sacred formsof God\": The Holy One, blessed be He, has seven sacred forms, all of which have their counterpart in man, as said, \"In the image of God He made him.\" . . . These are: the right and left thighs, the right and left hands, the torso, the phallus and the head."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" SHI‘UR KOMAH: THE MYSTICAL SHAPE OF THE GODHEAD • 45 In a different version, in which the torso and the phallus are not sepa- rated, the female is the seventh form that completes them. Above these seven bodily forms, corresponding to the seven lower Sefiroth, are the three upper Sefiroth symbolizing the spiritual forces: thinking, wisdom, and discernment. These are not conceived as bodily forms, but, at least according to the Zohar, are localized in the three chambers of the brain. There are, however, different developments of this symbolism, in which their correspondence to human organs is formulated in far greater de- tail.47 In Sefer ha-Bahir, the oldest extant Kabbalistic text, these forms of God are explicitly identified with the tselem ’Elohim of Genesis 1:27: \"In the image of God He created him.\" Sefer ha-Bahir adds: \"in all his limbs and in all his parts\" (S §55; M §82). These notions received their most decisive expression in the Zohar, which views man as the most perfect shape—\"the form that contains all forms\" or \"the image that contains all images\"—through which alone all things exist. The first worlds that were created were destroyed because this true shape had not yet achieved its perfection, so that the balance and harmony in which everything exists through the secret of this shape had not yet been established. The lower, earthly human being and the upper, mystical human being, in which the Godhead is manifested as shape, belong together and are unthinkable without one another in a well-ordered world. The perfection of the universe resides [or: appears] in this shape ofman; it was this shape seen by Ezekiel on the throne, and of thisthat Daniel spoke when he said, \"And, behold, there came with theclouds of heaven one like unto a son of man, and he came even tothe Ancient of days, and he was brought near before Him\" (Dan.7:13).48 Thus, the Zohar returns to the same Biblical motifs found in the Shi‘ur Komah. In the boldest parts of the Zohar, the ’Idra Rabba, the ’Idra Zutta, the Greater and the Lesser Assembly, (which are a sort of Kabbalistic turba philosophorum) and the Sifra de-Tseni‘utha, \"The Book of Conceal-"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 46 •ON THE MYSTICAL SHAPE OF THE GODHEAD ment\"—in which these ideas are summarized in solemn cadences—wefind a version of the Shi‘ur Komah reconceived in the spirit of the Kabba-lah. This new version is in no way inferior to the ancient fragments,either in boldness or, if one may phrase it thus, Gnostic presumptuous-ness. However, in contrast with the Shi‘ur Komah, it does not conceal itsmetaphysical background. Every organ of ’Adam Kadmon, nay, every lasthair on his head, is a world unto itself; every detail alludes to configura-tions of the Sefiroth that unfold and reveal the infinite wealth containedin them. The details of the description reveal some acquaintance withmedieval anatomy, and the author revels in the anthropomorphic para-doxes that supply the key words and mottos for the symbolic presenta-tion of his metaphysics. Daniel's vision of \"the Ancient of days\" (Dan.7:9), ‘Atik Yomin, whose head is as white as snow and whose hair is likepure wool, provides the author with a term uniting the graphic image ofa man of hoary old age with the notion of God's sheer remoteness andtranscendence (‘atik means both \"old\" and \"removed\"). But it is not bychance that the notion of ‘Atika Kadisha, the \"Holy Ancient One,\" rever-berates with both these meanings, pointing also to the God who movesback from transcendence to shape. The ’Idroth hardly speak about the’Ein-Sof, the infinite and formless God; in any event, they do not use thisterm. ‘Atika Kadisha, the Holy Ancient One, which serves here as thesupreme symbol, does not refer to ’Ein-Sof as such, but to ’Ein-Sof as itappears or, rather, is concealed in the highest Sefiroth. The concrete, vi-sual symbol of the Holy Ancient One thus contains the dialectics of thistransition from formlessness to form. It seems obvious that the writer of these pieces was aware of the presumptuousness of his efforts. The hero of the mystical romance of the Zohar is the mishnah teacher Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai. He begins his dis- course in the ’Idra Rabba with a warning against the very anthropo- morphism in which he is about to indulge. His warning is framed in the words of Deuteronomy: \"Cursed be the man that maketh a graven or molten image\" (Deut. 27:15). The words that follow concerning the \"se- crets of the Ancient of Days\" are termed mysteries, and the speaker harbors no doubts about their merit: \"I do not tell the heavens to listen,"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" SHI‘UR KOMAH: THE MYSTICAL SHAPE OF THE GODHEAD •47 nor the earth to hear, for we ourselves support the existence of the worlds.\" He begins his interpretation of the Shi‘ur Komah as follows: Before the Ancient of Ancients, the Hidden of the Hidden, pre- pared the shapes of the king and the crown of crowns, there was neither beginning nor end. He sketched and measured and spread out a curtain, in which he drew and called forth the primal kings. But these shapes did not endure, as it is written, \"These are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel\" (Gen. 36:31): a primal king over a primal Israel. And all those who were inscribed [in the curtain] were given names, but they did not endure, for He left them and concealed them. After a time, however, he entered that curtain and gave Himself shape. And we learn that, when He made up His mind to create the Torah, which had been hidden for two thousand years [prior to the creation of the world] and He took it out, the Torah instantly spoke before Him: \"He who wishes to shape and to have effect, must first shape his own shapes [that is: shape himself]\"And we have learned in the Sifra de-Tseni‘utha: \"The Ancient of Ancients, the Concealed of the Concealed, Mystery of Mysteries, took on a shape and it was given. He exists and yet does not exist; there is no one who can recognize him, for he is the Ancient of Ancients, the Elder of Elders, but in his shapes he becomes recognizable with- out being recognizable.\"49 Sifra de-Tseni‘utha uses the symbol of a scale to explain why the originalshapes did not endure: For so long as the scale did not exist, there was no seeing from countenance to countenance, and the primal kings perished,50 and their species had no existence, and the earth vanished.... This scale hangs in a place that is not; on it are weighed those who do not exist; the scale stands on itself; it is not attached [to anything] and it is not visible. Those who were not, who are and who will be, have ascended and do ascend upon it.51"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" 48 • ON THE MYSTICAL SHAPE OF THE GODHEAD According to some, this scale is identified with the Sefirah of Ḥokhmah,divine wisdom, the principle of divine harmony permeating all worldsand all being. According to others, it represents the balance between themale and the female principle. In any event, the scale represents theprinciple of structure and shape. It is worth noting that the same symbolis used at the beginning of Dionysius Areopagita's book on the holynames (I, §3), which is a fundamental work of fifth-century Christianmysticism. This author also speaks of \"that primeval divine scale whichregulates all of the holy orders, and reaches even unto the celestial cho-ruses of the angels.\" The problem of the divine form is also posed in a precise formulationat the beginning of the ’Idra Zutta (Zohar, III, 228a): The Holy Ancient One, the Most Concealed of all the Concealed,who is separated from everything and yet not separated, for every-thing is connected to Him and He is connected to everything. Heis everything; the Ancient of Ancients, the Concealed of the Con-cealed, who has shape and yet has no shape. He has shape in orderto maintain the universe, and yet has no shape because He does notexist. When He assumed shape, He produced nine blazing lightsfrom His shape, and these lights shine out of Him and spread con-tinuously on all sides, like a lamp [or candle] from which lightspreads on all sides; but when one approaches these lights in orderto know them, there is nothing there but the lamp alone. Thus, theHoly Ancient One: He is a mystical lamp, Concealed of all theConcealed, knowable only through those lights which spread outfrom Him, reveal, and instantly conceal again. And these lights arecalled the Holy Name of God, and that is why everything is one. The image in which the Ancient of Ancients is embodied, meticulouslydescribed in the ’Idroth as the shape of the Primal Man, is identical withthe name of God. The close interrelationship between the two realms,which we already found in the ancient Shi‘ur Komah, is emphasized in thiswork too: that of the seemingly sensory contemplation of the parts of thebody, and that of God's name, which breaks down into holy names in the"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" SH‘UR KOMAH: THE MYSTICAL SHAPE OF THE GODHEAD • 49 unfolding of the divine word. The Gnostic thinker Marcus describes in detail how the first word of His name—which, not coincidentally, is the first world of the Greek Bible, ἀρχή (beginning)—is to be analyzed, applying the procedures of linguistic mysticism to the Greek words and letters. In this procedure the names of the Greek letters are written, and their component letters are in turn written out as full names of letters, etc. The Kabbalists employed the same method in their own mysticism of language, in which the Tetragrammaton is split and divided into other divine names. In discussing this the ’Idra Zutta weaves together the themes of anthropomorphic and linguistic mysticism. What takes on form in God is that in which He reveals and announcesHimself. Yet what would such a revelation be if not the name of God?Thus, the true elements of the divine form are the component elementsof His name, the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. This idea is one thataccompanies Kabbalah from its first emergence and throughout its his-tory. One of the earliest classical works of Spanish Kabbalah is entitledSefer ha-Temunah (The Book of the Shape), the shape referred to beingthat of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, which is the symbolic shapeof the Godhead. One who is absorbed in contemplation of the Hebrewalphabet fulfills the verse mentioned at the beginning of this book: \"Andthe shape of God does he behold\" (Num. 12:8). These words refer toMoses, the receiver of the Torah; he was the great mystical adept, towhom this mystical form was revealed during his immersion in the Torahand its mysteries. Sefer ha-Temunah entirely avoids the forms of expressionfound in the Shi‘ur Komah literature; it only refers to the configuration ofthe letters, which may be described as symbols of the various Sefiroth. Butgenerally speaking, both views exist side by side; for the Kabbalist, theyare merely different façons de parler. The first configuration of ten, presented at the beginning of the ’Idra Zutta, is that of the lamp and its nine lights: while these form the shape of the divine name, they are still included in the unity of the Holy An- cient One, whose being is both transcendent and nontranscendent, and they are negated therein. It is not clear whether the nine lights corre- spond to the nine Sefiroth that emanate from the first and highest Sefirah and with it form a decade, or whether the author of the Zohar is speaking"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 50 • ON THE MYSTICAL SHAPE OF THE GODHEAD of nine lights that shine within the first Sefirah itself and illuminate its various internal aspects, even before the transition to the next Sefirah. In this Sefirah of divine wisdom a positive factor is added, diminishing the mystical obscurity and ineffability prevailing in the Zohar’s remarks about the Holy Ancient One. For our purposes there is no need to decide between these two interpretations. This highest mystical form of the Godhead is also described in the’Idroth as the ’Arikh ’Anpin (literally, \"the forbearing one\"; the term waslater construed as meaning \"the large face\"); it is likewise designated the\"white head,\" resha ḥivvera. The skull, cerebral chambers, forehead, eyes,nose, and beard of this face are meticulously described, together withstatements of mystical theology. Keeping with the biblical description ofthe Ancient of Days, he is depicted as an old man, white-haired, harmo-nious, thoughtful, and sleepless: \"His eyes are balanced as one, constantlylook about and do not sleep, as is said, 'Behold, the keeper of Israelneither sleeps nor slumbers'\"... \"Therefore, he has no eyebrows, andthere are no lids to his eyes\" (Zohar, III, 289a). The body belonging to thewhite head is not described, but its existence is assumed. On the otherhand, the parts of the head are described in great detail: This Holy Ancient One is entirely concealed, and the highest Wis- dom exists in his skull. Indeed, nothing of this Ancient is revealed except for the head, which is the supreme head of all heads. The highest wisdom, which is a [lower] head concealed therein, and is called the highest brain; the concealed brain, that is calm and pru- dent and of which no one knows apart from Himself. Three heads are carved out, one inside the other and one above the other. The first head [from below] is the concealed wisdom, which is concealed and not opened, and is the uppermost head for all other wisdoms [i.e., the Sefiroth emanating from it]. [The second head] is the su- preme head, Holy Ancient One, the Concealed of all Concealed, the supreme head of all heads. [The third head] is a head that is not a head, and no one knows and it cannot be known what is in this head, for it is beyond wisdom or insight [i.e., this third head is the formless ’Ein-Sof concealed within ‘Atika Kadisha, the Holy An-"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" SHI‘UR KOMAH: THE MYSTICAL SHAPE OF THE GODHEAD • 51 cient One]. . . And that is why the Holy Ancient One is called the nothingness, for the nothingness depends on him. And all those hairs and threads emerge from the concealed brain, and they are all smooth and even, and the neck [covered by the hair] is not visible (III, 288a-b). It is clear from this that the figure of the ‘Atika Kadisha also alludes to the ’Ein-Sof, which transcends all \"heads\" and is beyond all shapes.52 One can see how problematical this most profound image of the Godhead is spe- cifically as a shape—and to what extent the dialectics I spoke of earlier is operative here—from the fact that the same shape could also be called the nothingness. This image that can be called nothingness is ineffably filled with the rooted in shapelessness. The problematical figure of ’Arikh ’Anpin, the first and highest Sefirah,becomes clearer when it is manifested in the continuous sequence of thedivine manifestations, as the Ze‘ir ’Anpin. Taken literally, Ze‘ir ’Anpin re-fers to God as the \"Impatient One\"—that is, exhibiting the forces ofrigor and justice alongside those of mercy and infinite generosity. Thisconfiguration of the Sefiroth is the true shape of the Godhead, embracingas it does all the manifestations of His activity. According to the ’IdraRabbah, it includes everything from Ḥokhmah, the divine wisdom, downto Yesod, the foundation of the world. In another version, that of the ’IdraZutta, this configuration embraces the six Sefiroth in two trios from Ge-dulah (Ḥesed) to Yesod. Ḥokhmah and Binah are here conceived as distinctshapes through which the worlds of these two Sefiroth are shaped andconstructed; in this capacity they are designated as \"father\" and\"mother\" of the lower Sefiroth. Each Sefirah has its own structure, bywhich it was built as a \"shape within the shape.\" Each one also has con-cealed worlds that are permeated with the structural laws of that Sefirah.For the Zohar, however, Ze‘ir ’Anpin is essentially God as He is revealed inthe unity of his activity. The true name of God, the Tetragrammaton,befits this level of manifestation and expresses its special structure. Thefactor joining and complementing the Ze‘ir ’Anpin is its feminine counter-part, the Shekhinah, the last shape of the Divine in this system. In reality,however, the concealed shape of which we spoke above, which is on the"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" 52 •ON THE MYSTICAL SHAPE OF THE GODHEAD frontier of shapelessness, and that of the Ze‘ir ’Anpin, which can be ap-prehended through mystical meditation, are not two separate forms.Thus, we read in the ’Idra Rabbah: The epitome of all these things is that the Ancient of Ancients andthe Ze‘ir ’Anpin are all one; everything was, everything is, everythingwill he in Him. No change takes places in Him, has ever taken placein in Him, or will ever take place in Him. He has taken shape in theseforms, and thus the shape that comprises all shapes in itself is com‐plete; the shape that comprises all names in itself, the shape inwhich all other shapes appear; not that it is a shape, but that it hassomething of the shape. When the crowns and diadems [i.e., theSefiroth] come together, the universal perfection comes about, forthe higher ones and lower ones are combined in the shape of man.And because this shape embraces the higher and the lower ones,the Holy Ancient One has formed his forms and those of the Ze‘ir’Anpin in this shape. But if you ask: What is the difference betweenthem? [The answer is:] Everything was in one equilibrium, but fromhere [i.e., the Holy Ancient One) there emanates the forces ofMercy, while from here [the Ze‘ir ’Anpin] there issues severity [orjustice). And they are distinct [only] from our point of view. (Zohar,III, 14la‐b) Israel, it claims, lost the battle against Amalek because the children ofIsrael made a distinction between the ‘Atika Kadisha. who is called Noth-ingness, and the Ze‘ir ’Anpin, called YHVH: They wished to know [i.e., to distinguish] between the AncientOne, the Concealment of all Concealment, who is called ’Ayin(Nothing), and Ze‘ir ’Anpin, who is called YHVH. Therefore . . .they asked \"Is the Lord [YHVH] among us, or not [Heb.: Win;literally, \"nothing\"!?\" (Exod. 17:7). If so, why were they punished?Because they differentiated [between those primal shapes] andmade a test, as it is written \"because they tried the Lord\" (ibid.).Israel said: \"If it is this one [i.e., ‘Atika Kadisha], then we shall ask"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" SHI‘UR KOMAH: THE MYSTICAL SHAPE OF THE GODHEAD • 53 in one fashion; but if it is the other [Ze‘ir ’Anpin], then we shall ask in another fashion.\" (Zohar, II, 64b) In a brief passage, parallel to the ’Idroth (Zohar, II, 122b—123a), we find a succinct description of the \"countenance of the king\"—that is, the Ze‘ir ’Anpin—in which the anthropomorphic Shi‘ur Komah symbols are connected to theological motifs: It is taught in the Mystery of Mysteries: The king's head is arrangedaccording to Ḥesed and Gevurah. Hairs are suspended from his head,waves upon waves, which are all an extension, and which serve tosupport the upper and lower worlds: princes of princes, masters oftruth, masters of balance, masters of howling, masters of screaming,masters of judgment, masters of mercy, meanings of Torah, andsecrets of Torah, cleannesses and uncleannesses—all of them arecalled \"hairs of the king,\" that is to say, the extension that proceedsfrom the holy king, and it all descends from ‘Atika Kadisha. The forehead of the king is the visitation of the wicked. Whenthey are called to account because of their deeds, and when theirsins are revealed, then it is called \"the forehead of the king,\" thatis to say, Gevurah. It strengthens itself with its judgments, and ex-tends itself to its extremities. And this differs from the forehead of‘Atika Kadisha, which is called Raẓon (\"will,\" or \"pleasure\"). The eyes of the king are the supervision of all, the supervision of the upper and the lower worlds, and all the masters of supervi- sion are called thus. There are [different] colors joined together in the eyes, and all the masters of the supervision of the king are given the names of these colors, each one according to its way; all are called by the names of the colors of the eye. When the supervision of the king appears, the colors are stimulated. The eyebrows are called \"the place,\"which assigns supervision to all the colors, the masters of supervision. These eyebrows, in rela- tion to the lower regions, are eyebrows of supervision [that derive] from the river that extends and emerges, and [they are] the place which brings [influence] from that river in order to bathe in the whiteness of ‘Atika, in the milk that flows from the mother; for when"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" 54 • ON THE MYSTICAL SHAPE OF THE GODHEAD Gevurah extends itself, and the eyes shine with a red color, Atika Kadisha illumines its own whiteness, and it shines in the mother, and she is filled with milk and suckles everything, and all the eyes bathe in the mother's milk, which flows forth perpetually. This is [the meaning of] Scripture: \"Bathing in milk\" (Song of Songs 5:12)—in the milk of the mother, which flows forth perpetually, without cease. The nose of the holy king is the focal point of the countenance.53When the forces of power extend themselves and are gathered to-gether, they are the nose of the holy king, and these powers dependupon the single Gevurah and emerge from there. When the judg-ments are aroused and come from their borders, they are temperedonly by the smoke of the altar, and then it is written: \"And the Lordsmelled the sweet savor\" (Genesis 8:21). The nose of Atika is differ-ent, since it does not need [the sweet savor], because the nose ofAtika is called \"long-suffering\" in every respect;54 the light of theconcealed wisdom is called his \"nose.\" And this is \"praise\" as it iswritten \"My praise will 1 show you\" (Isaiah 48:9), and King Davidwas inspired by this: \"Praise of David\" (Psalm 145:1). The ears of the king: when the desire is there and the mother gives suck, and the light of Atika Kadisha is kindled, then the light of the two brains and the light of the father and mother are aroused—all of these are called \"the brains of the king,\" and they shine together, and when they shine together they are called \"the ears of the king,\" for Israel's prayers are received, and then the movement begins toward good and evil, and by this movement the winged creatures are aroused who receive the sounds in the world, and all of them are called \"the ears of the king.\"55 The lips of the king and his palate are then portrayed in a similar fashion. It is clear that Shi‘ur Komah imagery is closely interwoven here with the author's mystical theology concerning various foci of divine activity. Each of the \"bodily parts\" corresponds to a specific realm, which pro- vides the basis for a Kabbalistic thesis concerning the activity of the ‘Atika Kadisha and the Ze‘ir ’Anpin.

It tookcourage to employ these daring and, often enough, grotesque images.

At times Ḥokhmah is the head, and Binah is the throat or the two eyes, whileKeter is interpreted as the crown characterizing the primal human being in his kinglydignity (cf., e.g., Gaster, Studies and Texts, 11, pp. 1348). In another development of thissymbolism, which prepared the way for the doctrine of the ’Idra, the first Sefirah itselfis conceived as ’Adam Kadmon, while later on this term is used for the entire Sefiroticsystem. The term is employed in this manner, for example, by Jacob and Isaac ha-Kohen of Soria, while in the Zohar itself, it occurs only in the latest strata. The TikkuneiZohar, probably in contrast to other, more general symbolisms, speaks of ’adam kadmonle-kol ha-kedumim—Adam as preceding all other primordial beings. In Tikkunei ZoharḤadash, the destruction of the primal worlds is ascribed not to the Holy Ancient Onebut to ’Adam Kadmon (Warsaw, 1885), f. 114d. 48. Zohar, III, 144a, at the end of the ’Idroth. 49.

Beyond the heights above there is that which is not known, is not recognized, and is not described, and it comprises everything, and two heads are comprised in it. And everything is prepared thus. And [‘Atika Kadisha] is not in number, or in thought, or in calculation, but in the devotion of the heart. Of this it is said, 'I said: I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue' (Ps. 39:2).\" 53. According to talmudic halakhah, the nose is the feature that makes the face identifiable; cf. Yevamoth 120b. 54.

That the two trees in this passage actually represent the Sefiroth of Yesod andMalkhuth is confirmed by a parallel passage in R. Ezra of Gerona's Perush ha-Aggadot(MS.

The present passage simultaneously confirms Ezra's authorship of this piece, asdocumented at the end of the Oxford manuscript. 17.
