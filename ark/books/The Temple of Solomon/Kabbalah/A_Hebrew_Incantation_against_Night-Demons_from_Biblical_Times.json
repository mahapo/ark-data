TORCZYNER ONE of the most interesting \"Ca- naanitic\" inscriptions hitherto known was brought to our knowl- edge by Comte du Mesnil du Buisson in 1939 in Melanges Syriens offerts d M. Ren6 Dussaud, I, 421-34. Besides giving photo- graphs and cuts, Du Mesnil attempted to read and explain the text and its contents. The inscription is written on both sides of a gypsum tablet measuring 8.5 X 7 cm. This tablet, together with another smaller one, was found at Arslan-Tash in upper Syria, at the site of the small Assyrian town of Tjadattu (\"New-Town\" in Ara- maic), mentioned in Assyrian documents from the seventh century B.C. as lying on the main road from Harran (Abraham's dwelling-place) to Carchemish. A few months later W. F. Albright dealt with this inscription,1 adding his observations on its background, writing, and date, and correcting some of Du Mesnil's readings, with a new translation of the whole text.2 Unfortunately, however, the readings -and, even more, the interpretation-- proposed by both scholars show grave mistakes in almost every line; hence the great importance of this remarkable text for our knowledge of Hebrew and the Bible has not been recognized. A new reading and interpretation are therefore given here. For this attempt I was able to use, besides the publications mentioned, a gypsum copy of the tablet which Dr. A. Reifenberg brought from Aleppo and which (except for the upper and lower edges of the tablet where the two halves were joined together, thus destroying part of the letters) gives a true picture of the tablet in relief. Later, when my observa- tions were almost complete, Professor E. L. Sukenik kindly put at my disposal some additional photographs. The tablet itself, a rectangle, is rounded above and pierced by a hole through which a string was drawn to hang it up. With its inscription it served as an in- cantation, not, as Du Mesnil and Albright thought, to assist women in childbirth, but, as will be shown, against night- demons in general. On the obverse, in re- lief, is represented the figure of a winged lion (called in Hebrew Ariel3 or Cherub) with a human head and a pointed helmet, and below it a she-wolf with a scorpion's tail, devouring what looks like a human figure of which only the legs project from her jaws. \"On the reverse stands a march- ing god, brandishing a small axe in his right hand; he wears the short Assyrian tunic and long cloak, opened so as to leave the left leg free; to his girdle is at- tached a short sword and on his head is a turban surmounted by a lily. This head- gear is characteristically late Assyrian\" (Albright). On both sides of the tablet a main in- scription was first written in the soft gypsum, in large letters, and it is therefore as a whole easily readable. The horizontal lines of this main text leave the figures upon the tablet generally free of writing. Since the writer had something more to 1 \"An Aramaean Magical Text in Hebrew from the Seventh Century B.c.,\" BASOR, No. 76 (December, 1939), pp. 5-11. 2 Later publications have added nothing to our understanding of this inscription. A copy of Orientalia, Vol. XI (Rome, 1942), containing on pp. 41-79 a study of this incantation by Th. Gaster, reached Jerusalem only after this article was written. Gaster recognizes ,'1• in II. 9 if. as \"covenant,\" \"bond,\" but not in the decisive instances of 11. 1 and 3. Other- wise, he follows the mistakes of his predecessors or puts forth suggestions which cannot be accepted. a See my Hebrew article on \"Ariel\" in Leshonenu, XIV, 111. 18 This content downloaded from 143.89.105.150 on Sun, 13 Dec 2015 13:55:15 UTCAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"A HEBREW INCANTATION AGAINST NIGHT-DEMONS 19 say, however, he put some additional mat- ter between the lines of the main text, upon the edges of the tablet, and upon the figures themselves, in smaller and more cursive signs, making the reading of this part of the inscription more difficult; some letters are also partly destroyed, and a small section of the tablet's surface, near the bottom of the obverse, is broken away. The writing, as Albright correctly ob- serves, shows the same stage of transition from the ancient Canaanitic and Aramaic script in its classic forms to the cursive Aramaic characters (known particularly from Egyptian papyri), as do other Ara- maic inscriptions of the seventh or eighth century B.C. from Assur and elsewhere. Here, too, the scribe endeavored to follow the classic forms, but, writing quickly, he used also cursive forms, such as later com- pletely supplanted the fuller classic char- acters. Albright, therefore, is correct in attributing the inscription approximately to the seventh century. B.C.; however, we may have to put the date somewhat earlier or later, possibly even to the extent of a century. As for the language, both scholars are in error; speaking of a \"Hebrew\" inscrip- tion, they nevertheless explain words and sentences according to exclusively Phoe- nician or even Ugaritic usage. In reality, however, the language used throughout the inscription is in every particular pure biblical Hebrew. 1. The main inscription opens with the words: rSK ?NEG .hii 1 1'•• pi .j N .npin .51 1N2n .52 lpain .5= Even in these few lines it is necessary to rectify some fundamental errors in the publications named. The first word, nrunr , I am inclined to understand as stat. constr. of nre , ac- cording to biblical usage of the stat. constr. before prepositions, e.g., nnitE \" sp2 (Isa. 9:2), 1:b nor (Ps. 58:5), and many other such instances (cf. Gesenius-Kautzsch, Grammatik, ? 130). We should, therefore, have ni2 and not 'n •b, for, like biblical Hebrew, the inscription differentiates between stat. abs. fem., e.g., ~ , and stat. constr., nb, etc. One could certainly also under- stand n•r5 as stat. abs., e.g., r5; r5. In the Bible itself there is no •n5m or i:ib; in talmudic texts we have the nomen actionis M'MS, but for the bibli- cal period Mib•l , constr. nYr• , is most likely, used in the same sense as the masc. irz5b, pl. ~\"VJr•, this latter mentioned also in Isa. 3:20 among the parts of women's clothing and ornaments. A word such as m rb, \"incantation,\" \"conjura- tion,\" usually stands at the beginning of Akkadian incantations: siptu, used there also with the verb (sipta) dabdbu, or Judbubu, \"to recite an incantation\"; this expression occurs in biblical Hebrew, too: 3j0' ?nEC 22~'1, \"to recite a conjura- tion of the sleeping\" (Cant. 7:10; cf. my Hebrew pamphlet on Canticles, p. 19). The conjuration, risrn, is addressed to the cEphata, Rflh . This reading, as also further on in the small inscription on the winged lion, is given correctly by Albright, who, however, wrongly trans- lates: \"O Flyer.\" But with this word we have the explanation of a passage in the Bible. cEphata is an Aramaic pl. fern., used as a name of the nightly shadows, seen in popular belief as she-demons flying in the dark, and called in targumic Aramaic also ?b, \"shadow-demons.\" These she-demons of the darkness are re- This content downloaded from 143.89.105.150 on Sun, 13 Dec 2015 13:55:15 UTCAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"20 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES ferred to in our Hebrew inscription by their Aramaic name, thus showing the Aramaic origin of the idea. Apparently our Hebrew incantation is translated from Aramaic (see further on), and the transla- tor found no adequate Hebrew equivalent for the term cEphata. This explains Job 10:21-22, which says, in reference to Sheol, the land of the shadows of death: \"Before I go not to return, to a land of darkness and gloom (n15Y), a land of cEphata (n5r4v) as (in any) darkness; (but) of gloom without arrangements (P'-•0 RH •i•t•),\" etc. In my Hebrew commentary on Job (Jerusalem, 1941) I have already shown that the meaning of the words \"gloom without arrangements\" is \"a gloom against which no arrangements can be made\"; this agrees with the parallels in Job 23:17: \"Because I had not arranged (read t~._ , from r•j, 'to arrange,' as in Arabic , instead of '0..') against the darkness, and before my face has covered the gloom\"; and 37:19: \"Teach us what we shall say unto it (not 'him,' ib \"•-• •M), for we cannot ar- range (7]my: •) against the dark- ness.\" But this last verse, placing in parallelism the verbs \"to say\" and \"to arrange,\" shows that \"S, \"to arrange,\" is used here as an abbreviation for \"to ar- range speech, words,\" as in i'b- \"•1 in Job 32:14, or ?MY alone in Isa. 44:7: \"And who, as I, shall call, and shall de- clare it, and arrange (ria.ty) for me.\" Compare also .'1it in parallelism to \"121, \"word,\" in Job 41:4. Thus in all these passages it is not the darkness itself against which words are arranged but the darkness filled with evil spirits, against whom such words, such conjurations, are to be arranged. There are, says Job, such incantations to be ar- ranged against the cEphata. But the final darkness of the Sheol is one against whose evil spirits, against whose cEphata- demons, no incantation can be of any avail. The Book of Job, as I have tried to show by many examples in my Hebrew commentary, is translated from Aramaic; here also the evil shadow-demons, cEphata, are mentioned by their Aramaic name, as pl. fem. And it is to such Ara- maic incantation texts against the cEphata that Job actually refers. The singular of this word must perhaps be recognized in Amos 4:13: T'J1 M• M'E , if we are to understand it (accord- ing to the other passage in Amos 5:8: \"Who turns the gloom into morning [I2• \"p. \"7~1]\") as meaning: \"He turns into morning the cEpha(ta)-de- mon(s) of the darkness.\" These shadow- demons themselves are seen in human form, for they are originally the spirits of the dead who, according to popular belief, return into their bodies and haunt the earth in the darkness of the night. The word nrS (stat. constr. of •b in 1. 3) both Du Mesnil and Albright have understood as 1 , \"goddess\"; and since the word recurs many times in our inscrip- tion, this mistake in itself prevented a real understanding of the whole text. Ac- tually, there is no such word as nb, i., \"goddess\" (though it occurs in Ugaritic), either in the Bible or in Phoeni- cian inscriptions, where the goddess is called n•'1 or hi\"m and not o .

There is no such word as tV, \"goddess,\" in Hebrew, and certainly not here, where, according to the whole context, the bibli- cal word N , stat. constr. N , in the sense of \"curse,\" \"oath,\" \"conjuration,\" is meant. The conjuration recited here is \"the conjuration of Ssm, the son of Pdrsh (•175 ~j: P00 ).\" The people recit- ing such conjurations did not rely on their own ability to compile them; they used for their purpose a formula, tried and proved before, spoken long ago by divine figures or the heroes of the past. Thus also, e.g., the conjurer in the Akkadian incan- tations says: \"Incantation of the gods Ea and Marduk, incantation of Damu and Ninkarrak, incantation of Ninaiaquddu, the mistress [of incantations]; they said it, I (only) repeat (their words) (Ju-nu iq-bu- nim-ma ana-ku u-Ja-an-ni).\"4 It is the same word n which in the meaning of \"conjuration\" or \"curse,\" \"oath,\" occurs many times in the Bible, e.g.: \"Then the priest shall charge the woman an oath of cursing\" (MNi n1~0 1, Num. 5:21), and which, as in the continuation of our inscription, is used with the verbs t. or N23, e.g.: \"Neither with you only do I conclude (nr m.•) this covenant and this oath (;b1S); but with him that standeth here with us this day,\" etc. (Deut. 29:13-14). Or: \"If any man tres- pass against his neighbour and he recites an oath against him (N 1: alri) to TT: cause him to swear, and the oath (ba) come before thine altar in this house\" (I Kings 8:31; II Chron. 6:22). Thus nb ,Rb, \"to recite an oath, curse, con- juration,\" like Mi'p •, \"to recite,\" \"to take up a lamentation\" (Jer. 7:29; Ezek. 19:1, 27:2, 28:12, 32:2, etc.), par- ticularly as an imperative MR NR, \"take up lamentation,\" etc., recurs often enough in the Bible. And thus we have to read also the following words of our inscrip- tion simply: \"t nil Ni_ , \"Take up the curse (oath, conjuration) and to the she-stranglers say,\" where Du Mesnil and Albright carry the imperative Mt to the name Pdrsh, as a part of it (reading PdrshshD), understand 5 of 1 as an affirmative particle, as in Akkadian or Ugaritic, and explain \"•2 (\"say!\") as the (Aramaic or Phoenician) substantive • ., \"lamb.\" The name Ssm, from which are also derived the proper names Shashmai in Akkadian, '*i2 in the Bible, 3eC \"J:Y in Ugaritic inscriptions (as Du Mesnil and Albright have seen), is therefore the name of a god, and it is he who is represented on the reverse of the tablet, threatening the demons. He is the son of Pdrsh, and to this name Du Mesnil-correctly, as it seems-has compared the name Pdrtt in Ugarit. But in this Hebrew inscription only one sh is written, and if this is not a contraction of shsh, sh may represent only the ending of a shorter name. Ssm, the son of Pdrsh, is an ancient deity of non- Semitic origin. For the belief in such a god, powerful enough to threaten the demons, has its root in the ancient past, not in the time of the writer of the inscrip- tion. The spelling Shashmai in Assyrian texts, however, shows that the Hebrew Ssm may be only the equivalent of the original Shshm, pronounced Ssm only in Assyrian, according to the pronunciation of sh as s in that language. And, therefore, this god-name 000 , and not the numeral 000', \"sixty,\" may be meant also in the month-name •E -T3 in Phoenician in- scriptions. The people, appealing to Ssm ben SE.

But in lines 5 ff. one person is speaking (?'I~T, N28). Therefore the following sentence contains the curse or conjuration which Ssm ben Pdrsh is meant to take up. In his words Ssm addresses the demons, called here npp., as plural feminine and not as singular. This fact is clear not only from the form of the verbs in lines 6 and 8, t•?•i, iN (see further on), but from the very word oP:M, the \"she- stranglers,\" which occurs not only here but also in the Aramaic incantation texts from Nippur (J. A. Montgomery, Aramaic Incantation Texts from Nippur, p. 148, etc.) in the spelling KRptY or P :R, where Montgomery erroneously trans- lates \"necklace-spirits\" instead of \"she- stranglers\" (the signs :', r, i, N are used promiscuously in these late Aramaic texts from Babylonia). As a remote compari- son only may be mentioned the modern Arabic name of the feminine demon Qarinah,5 chanouq al-hamal, \"strangler of the lamb,\" which here induced Du Mesnil and Albright to look for a lamb. To these stranglers, and not to the al- leged deities (nN) mentioned in the pre- ceding lines, the god Ssm shall speak (11. 5-8): The house which I enter ye shall not enter, and the court which I tread ye shall not tread..... The verbs i20 and l•'ln are regu- lar Hebrew pl. fem. forms, spelled as here in nnir, ''•• (Gen. 30:38-39), and in many other instances. In the following lines (8-12) the con- jurers again address Ssm, son of Pdrsh, reminding him of his promises to them: .nSy .;5 .rc nit .108 .3 1 Ei ?i :J0i .211 \"Thou hast concluded a covenant of eternity withus,\" rvL b•_ .b •.. _ b_ (not rh, \"goddess\"), is used here in the meaning of a covenant confirmed by an oath or curse, as in Deut. 29:11 ff.: \"That thou shouldest enter into cove- nant with the Lord thy God, and into his oath ('nS al), which the Lord thy God maketh (r1) with thee..... Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath (n 1~n nR 07i ~MT'r? r1 rNTM),\" and elsewhere. Thus •Y nS is the same as 3L '1 2 (Gen. 9:16; Exod. 31:18, etc.), \"a cove- nant,\" valid eternally. But the inscription continues thus: (\"Not only hast thou concluded this covenant for us, but it is a covenant\") . 19 f~ •. 1 _ _., etc., \"which thou hast made with us and every di- vine being,\" etc. Here im is simply the Hebrew relative particle (not a mis- take for Asherat as another name of the \"eternal goddess\" found erroneously in 11. 9-10), thus again showing the pure Hebrew character of the inscription. DR 1Z, \"divine being,\" or \"minor deity,\" occurs in the same meaning not only in Ugaritic but also in the Bible, particularly in the books of wisdom such as Job. It must be understood here as singular, according to the following words: j~tip • \"[iul 1 i, \"and every divine being and chief and [pri]nce, all our holy ones.\" The word :\", originally used for (minor) deities in a military sense as SConcerning this demon see T.

After this word, where Du Mesnil reads 17, and between the feet of the marching god, after the one almost obliterated sign, a clear \", forming the end of a short word, is visible. Here one could think of \"2, \"angel\" (cf. Isa. 63:9 in the reading of the Septuagint: ob wrpkjpvs ('•, MT: •) ob8i '&yXos, iXX' abrs E~Woae abirois). More prob- ably, however, we have to read, in paral- lelism to :', ~i, \"officer,\" \"prince,\" in the meaning of \"angel,\" as this word is used in the Book of Daniel: \"And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince ($5'13 lim) which standeth for the children of thy people (12: 1); and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia (CT' \"): and when I am gone forth, lo the prince of Greece (jl' \"v:) shall come ... . and there is none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your prince\" (i2zm) (10:20-21, and often in the Talmud). And, indeed, some traces of 0 may be recognized. For this reading should be quoted also Jer. 11:15: ?•V~,T? rn• ? •r22 ;•1 2 \"*54\" .1~ 25 mip ~itm2 a2\"2 , where Wlp \"' (2 is a preposition, not part of the word) is the same as W1p \"t (r2zt) in Phoenician inscriptions and, parallel to it, 1'21. (not ME) is the plural of :O in the same sense as in our inscription, \"a divine being of minor degree.\"6 All these divine beings are summed up by the words \"mlp 5t, \"all our holy ones.\" In the same sense is the word di-z, 3j~ip, used in the Bible, and particularly in the Book of Job (see my Hebrew commentary on 5:1, 6:10, etc.). The spelling myl instead of .27'ip is the same as in for .b (1.9). This covenant which Ssm, the son of Pdrsh, and all the other holy ones are quoted to have made with the conjurers, was made (ll. 13-15) $Y 1 itr 8 -2 i.e., \"including (lit.: with) a curse (put upon) heaven and earth,\" etc. Thus we have to compare not only such passages as Deut. 4:26 and 30:19, where heaven and earth are invoked as warning witnesses, but preferably such as Hos. 2:20: \"And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.\" Thus here also heaven and earth, etc., are forced by the covenant not to touch those protected by it, and such covenant in- cluded even the spirits descending from heaven or arising out of Sheol to haunt the earth. After line 13 the earth, p'1, is once more mentioned in line 15; and ac- cording to the partition usual in the Bible, summing up everything which is above the earth and below the earth, and taking into consideration the letters visible and the traces partly recognizable, no other read- ing than the following fits the text: YN• 012~ n ' With the cursing by \" heaven and earth 891 nbN . ~•• above (or: '1 Y, above and) with the cursing by Bacal y MD n• below the earth.

After this, •2, \"with the cursing,\" is written once more in line 15, but there is no con- tinuation for it. If we do not assume that some word may have been written out of its proper place on the broken bottom of the obverse, which seems unlikely, there are two other possibilities: either the word ~b5: is written by mistake or- what to me seems more probable-the Hebrew scribe, who as it seems merely translated an incantation originally writ- ten in Aramaic, did not find it necessary for the benefit of his public to copy the whole of the original text and stopped at the bottom of the reverse. Such tablets may also have been made wholesale and not too conscientiously copied in each case. To this main inscription, addressing Ssm, son of Pdrsh, and asking him to curse the she-stranglers, according to the covenant concluded with the conjurers, in connection with the figure of the god on the reverse of the tablet, are added some more short legends, those tried and proved formulas against the same evil spirits but connected with the figures on the tablet's obverse. 2.

The relative par- ticle in this inscription is \"it, as in the Bible, not wz; E cannot stand instead of ~E; \"D'• can only mean: \"my co- wife,\" \"my husband's other wife,\" or \"other wives,\" not \"concubines.\" Only the wife and not the man has a Mi, or i in Arabic, as in I Sam. 1:6: \"And her co-wife i'2 (not: adversary), pro- voked her,\" not 82 (\"his other wife\"!). As for the contents, why should all these persons be named in this incanta- tion? I accept the reading and interpretation of HIor6n as the name of this ancient deity (cf. Albright's studies on this god in AJSL, LIII [1936/37], 1-12, and BASOR, No. 70 [1938], p. 23, mentioned in his article on our incantation, to which new material could now be added). But I find in .Hor6n the name. of the deity repre- sented in our tablet in the figure of the winged lion. And it is to Hor6n that the she-wolf (below him) turns in this pas- sage. For the she-wolf is not one of the demons threatened by our incantation; those figures represented on incantation texts or amulets are intended to show the hopeful outcome of the conjuring and not the evil threatened by the spirits.

And if here, along with the helmeted HIor6n and with the god threat- ening the demons with the ax, the she- wolf is shown in the act of devouring other beings, she is a helpful deity, de- vouring the evil spirits, and not herself one of them. For, as I have said before, these evil spirits are seen as fitted with human bodies, actually as the spirits of the dead, reinvested in their bodies, and visiting the earth in the darkness.

The feminine forms 00, Y7l and niZZ are used in accordance with the feminine character of the stranglers or cEphata-demons. JIor6n and the she- wolf are helping each other to destroy the demons. H.or6n kills them, according to his military character as shown by his helmet, while the wolf-goddess devours their slain carcasses. The wolf speaks modestly about herself in comparison with the other wives of her husband. Such modesty befits not only human beings (cf. Judg. 6:7: \"Behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house\") but also the demons. Thus, for example, the bereaved husband in The Arabian Nights, seeking his lost beautiful wife throughout the seven seas, when he at last reaches the home of the old demon and asks him whether he has seen his wife, receives the answer: \"I my- self never saw her, but beyond seven mountains you will find my brother, older in age than I by a day, but in wisdom by years, who may well know more than I.\" In the last line we shall have to read e'[?]p ':y in ,;•t'•, though the signs w-p are written above the line, for lack of space. \"'•p 542 means \"my holy husband,\" as m'p \"M means \"my holy mountain,\" etc. The whole ex- pression \"the wife of my holy husband\" is synonymous with 'T12, \"my co-wife.\" The short address of the she-wolf to I;Ior~n is given not only in poetical style but with a clear and apparently intended rhyme at the end of each of the three sentences. This is the first such clear ex- ample of rhymed poetry in ancient He- brew. The rhyme here serves magical pur- poses, and in magical use the rhyme cer- tainly has its origin. On the name of the she-wolf, see further on. 3. The inscription on the winged lion, also directed against the she-stranglers, SSuch abbreviation of a clause, following another in shortened parallelism, is not infrequent in the Bible. Thus the famous passage in Amos 3:12, misunder- stood and ill treated by commentators and trans- lators, simply means: \"As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria (only) with the end of a bed (from all their beds of state), and (that dwell) in Damascus (•ZZTM ) (with the end of) a couch (gf).\" On Israelites dwelling in Damascus cf. I. Kings 20:34.

But since \"1Y is a masculine form, the addressee of this im- perative must be mentioned within the sentence itself, summing up the shadow- demons, cEphata, by one other term, in the singular. Therefore, we have to pro- nounce not WE_, either as a proper name (Du Mesnil), or as an adverb meaning \"at once\" (Albright), which does not exist in Hebrew, but 079 in a substantive meaning: \"the terror, trouble (of the night),\" derived from the verb used in this sense in Gen. 41:7-8: \"And Pharaoh awoke .... And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled (PY'ni)\"; Dan. 2:1-3: \"And.... Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, where- with his spirit was troubled (maDnni), and his sleep brake from him ..... And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled ('•rDn) to know the dream\"; Ps. 77:5: \"Thou holdest mine eye waking: I am troubled ('nry1j) and I cannot speak\"; and also Judg. 13:25: \"And the spirit of the Lord began to trouble him (IM4Qb) in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.\" The \"trouble\" caused a man by a spirit until his mind is troubled by the \"terror of the nights\" (Cant. 3:8) or \"of the night\" (Ps. 91:5), is here called 035, or more fully, .• D, \"the trouble of my night,\" \"my nightly trouble\"; it is not Lilith who is mentioned here (Albright). Therefore, the incantation as a whole serves not as a help in childbirth but as a means of destroying the strangling spirits of the night, the shadows flying at dusk in the chamber of darkness. 4. The inscription on the she-wolf, a divine creature helping to destroy the nightly spirits. Du Mesnil reads here: 15;1 nrii0 nT71; Albright: not~ 5; nriiM. But if we recognize that the two letters nT mean (according to biblical spelling) .'T, \"olive\" (cf. the analogous spelling rn for .:, \"house\"), it is easy to recognize the correct reading: M \" ::n \"'• , i.e., \"Thou (who lieth here in the chamber of darkness) hast washed (thy body) with (cleansing) olive oil, (and already the nightly terror) has gone.\" Thus this passage gives the continuation to the preceding short leg- end. Compare the expression recurring throughout the Akkadian incantations: ina .'amni tapala., \"with oil shalt thou wash,\" and the expression occurring many times in the Samaria ostraca: y~ M 2•, \"oil for washing.\" 5. The inscription beginning on the breast of the marching god on the reverse, continuing on his left side, and between the lines of the main inscription.

Sz, a non-Semitic, perhaps a Hurrian, name may be the feminine counterpart of the masculine Ssm, who may be her holy husband, mentioned in her address to H.or6n. Sz is asked to open an olive; and since the whole incantation is invoked against the spirits of the darkness, and since in the continuation the rising of the sun ( Nz ' RE ) is mentioned, the opening of an olive certainly serves to make oil and light; kindling a lamp filled with olive oil until the sun rises expels the spirits of the night, which are not allowed to remain after daybreak (cf. Gen. 32:26: \"And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh\"). Until then, the lighting of such a magic lamp has the power to drive away the evil demons. With this in mind, we recognize also for the last lines the traces of the simple reading: .nST .T0 15n mij0 .82'' 17 .5 .~118 .'its 15, \"Sz, open an olive for me, that we shall have light, until the sun rises, the morning shines!\" In this interpretation we have to reject the reading -1.bnr in the last line, un- derstood as \"travail thou and give birth\" by both scholars, and inducing them to find here an incantation for childbirth. Not only should we expect in this case the feminine forms '1 \"i, as in MrE; but also there is no connection between sunrise and childbirth. Graphically, how- ever, no other reading than nr5 15 or n; lr5 is possible, and, of these, only the former, using the same root parono- mastically, is at all likely. And here again our inscription gives us the explanation of a difficult passage in Job 11:17: \"And more than the noon will rise a morning (Ir), thou shalt shine (vocalize riat and see my commentary), as the morn- ing (\"i'3•) shalt thou be.\" Here we must read rin \"•n as a verb with the noun derived from it: \"the sun has risen, the morning shines.\" Also hr; in other passages of the Bible, such as \"]0 'Tel as a designation of the living in general, may originally have meant \"(the dwellers in) the light of life.\" Summing up the results of our study, we have here an incantation against the feminine demons of the darkness which strangle sleeping men in the terror of the night, the nightmare threatening them in every dark chamber, especially on the wedding night.8 These demons are also called cEphata, and in Job 10:22 such incantations against the cEphata-demons are actually referred to. Against these stranglers three divine beings are invoked: Ssm, son of Pdrsh, whose curse is valid against everything in heaven and upon earth, threatening the demons with his ax; the god Hor6n, destroying the demons by fighting them and giving their car- casses to the wives of a holy being (per- haps Ssm, son of Pdrsh); and Sz, one of the wives, represented as a she-wolf, devouring the slain demons. Linguistically, all the forms occurring in the inscription are pure biblical He- brew, enlarging our knowledge of it by new words, and explaining difficult pas- sages, particularly in the Book of Job, of which the biblical text is only a transla- tion of an Aramaic original composed dur- ing the exile in Babylonia. Thus also our incantation apparently is translated from an Aramaic original. The spelling is nearer the more defective usage of the Samaria ostraca than the Judean usage in the s Cf. S.

Apparently a son of Israel, perhaps one of those sons of the northern kingdom driven into exile by Tiglath-pileser III or his successors, translated the Aramaic in- cantation.
