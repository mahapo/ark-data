In it we find mentionedseveral claims and aspects which distinguish the mysticism found inthis literature. We hear of “contemplation,” “ascent to heaven,” and“vision of divine palaces.” We learn that a human being can crosstraditional boundaries between the phenomenological and the tran-scendent realms, make a contemplative ascent to heaven, behold thechambers of God in a personal manner, and communicate these expe-riences and visions to others. We also encounter an enigma: Who isthis qualified person?The first part of the question: “Who is able to contemplate theseven palaces?,” seems to describe a spiritual introspective process,taking place on an internal level, in which a visionary reflects andmeditates upon the seven palaces of God, placing them in the centerof his contemplation, imagination, and thought. The second part: “andto ascend and behold the heaven of heavens, and to see the chambersof chambers,” pertains to beliefs, practices, and revelations. It claimsthe existence of a different reality, beyond the phenomenological world,envisioned as a celestial realm of God, in which his divine palace issituated in the heaven of heavens. It also appears to introduce thepossibility of divine-human encounters outside traditional norms ofhistorical revelation. These words seem likewise to affirm a specificreligious consciousness, which enables a human being to exceed pa-rameters of traditional norms, time, and space, and to initiate a direct"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"2Beholders of Divine Secretsencounter with the divine, in a meditative process, visualized as apersonal, otherworldly voyage to heaven.The third part of the question: “and say I saw the chamber of YH,”may refer to the manner in which contemplative experiences and theirattendant, interpreted divine visions and revelations, are formulatedand conveyed through verbal expressions, and sayings. Rabbi Akiva’squery also seeks to discern “Who” can take part in such quests which,in fact, offer an alternative to the traditional concept of divinely initi-ated communication between God and his people. It also, perhaps,indicates an attempt to distinguish the identity of the ones who areinvolved in these endeavors, and to situate them in an historical andcultural context.This study concentrates on the facets of Rabbi Akiva’s question asa framework for the discussion. It explores the nature of the mysticaltradition found in the enigmatic Hekhalot and Merkavah literatureand the manner in which its mystical notions are molded and commu-nicated. The social and cultural contexts of its writers will be consid-ered as well.The Hekhalot and Merkavah literature includes various manu-scripts and literary traditions written and edited over a long period oftime, arguably between the third and seventh centuries C.E., in Pales-tine and Babylonia. They contain overlapping mystical, cosmological,messianic, and magical traditions, presented in several literary forms.With a full awareness of the complexity of this literature and the in-tricacy of its traditions, this study focuses on the mystical dimensionsof the literature. It examines several treatises in which these mysticalnotions principally find expression. These include textual units knownHekhalot Rabbati (The Greater Book of Hekhalot), Hekhalot Zutarti (TheLesser Book of Hekhalot), Ma’aseh Merkavah (The Works of the Chariot),Sefer Hekhalot (The Book of Hekhalot) also entitled the Hebrew Book ofEnoch or 3 Enoch, the Shi’ur Komah traditions (Measurements of theDivine Body), various fragments known as Shivhei Metatron, and sev-eral texts found in the Cairo Genizah.The discussion treats these topics in six chapters. The first chapterof this study presents a brief overview of the Hekhalot and Merkavahliterature as it was composed, edited, and integrated over a substan-tial period of time. It introduces debated historical questions of originand dating, as well as the complex nature of its manuscripts, literarytraditions, and conceptual notions. Maintaining the view that schol-arly analysis of mystical phenomena is primarily textually based, thechapter then discusses aspects of the mystical tradition found in theHekhalot and Merkavah literature, in light of current observationsand methodological premises in the study of mysticism."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Introduction3The second chapter distinguishes specific mystical characteris-tics to be found in the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature, in lightof methodological premises in the study of mysticism. Applying aliterary-phenomenological approach, the discussion first classifiessignificant mystical aspects present in several Hekhalot andMerkavah literary units and accounts, both theoretical and practi-cal. It then demonstrates the ways in which these notions interactas they create a distinctive mystical tradition. In particular, atten-tion will be paid to the interplay between mystical techniques, ritu-alistic practices, inner perceptions, and spiritual transformation onthe one hand, and the ability to decode divine visions and revela-tions, which these entail, on the other hand.The second topic which this study addresses is the presence ofmythology in Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism. Scholars have dem-onstrated connections between the Hekhalot and Merkavah literatureand similar notions in priestly traditions, rabbinical writings, the DeadSea Scrolls, apocalyptic texts, early Christian literature, Gnostic sources,and magical theurgical traditions and practices. The present investiga-tions calls attention to additional mythological echoes which resonatein various mystical narrations of the Hekhalot and Merkavah litera-ture. This aspect has not yet been thoroughly investigated in scholarlyliterature. This study seeks to demonstrates its importance. It suggeststhat mythological patterns of expressions, as well as themes, and modelsrooted in Near Eastern mythological sources, are evoked in theHekhalot and Merkavah literature, in a spiritualized fashion, as theprincipal way of presenting its mystical content.Chapter 3 provides background to a close literary-phenomeno-logical analysis of the relationship of myth and mysticism to be foundin chapters 4 and 5. It distinguishes the nature of mystical discoursein Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism, suggesting that this traditionconceptualizes and conveys many of its mystical notions by evokinga variety of mythological frameworks. It then introduces dominantcharacteristics of the three prevalent mythological frameworks, pre-sumed to be employed in Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism. Theseinclude mythological forms of thought and expression in general, aswell as biblical, and Mesopotamian mythology in particular. The chapterconcludes with an assessment of the pertinence and possible applica-bility of these three mythological forms in Hekhalot and Merkavahmysticism. It demonstrates that this tradition employs specific pat-terns, often characterized as mythological, such as prose narrative style,pictorial imagery, tangible metaphors, and figurative language, in or-der to construct and articulate abstract, mystical concepts. The discus-sion further treats the apparent probability that mythological traditions"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"4Beholders of Divine Secretscontained in the Hebrew bible have bestowed some degree of inspira-tion on several Hekhalot and Merkavah mystical presentations. Fi-nally, in light of the view that traditions within a given cultural-religiousgroup, or within neighboring cultures, interact with one another in anongoing process of absorption, transformation and interchange, the dis-cussion demonstrates the presence and prominence of Mesopotamianmythological traditions in the syncretistic Hellenistic Roman world of lateantiquity, in which the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature was compiled.These are treated as plausible sources, which could have inspired theHekhalot and Merkavah imagery, directly or indirectly.The fourth and the fifth chapters demonstrate, by a close literary-phenomenological analysis, the manner in which various mysticalaspects are presented in the Hekhalot and Merkavah descriptions.Chapter 4 focuses on the spiritual voyage, outlined in a dialecticalway in the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature. It discusses the mannerin which the spiritual-contemplative processes are described in amythological fashion as actual corporal ascents to heaven, taking placein a mythological cosmos. The discussion examines, in particular, threemain topics: (a) the image of the visionary, (b) the inner journey, and(c) the spiritual transformations at its end.Chapter 5 concentrates on the concept of a figurative and ab-stract God, revealed at the height of the mystical-visionary ascent. Itexamines depictions which treat God’s spiritual character, infinitetranscendent nature, and his inconceivable qualities, and demonstrateshow they are expressed by traditional themes and imagery rooted inspecific mythological traditions. These include, for example, enor-mous physical size, exceptional beauty, exclusive kingship, and atangible supremacy.Both chapters 4 and 5 examine mythological patterns present invarious Hekhalot and Merkavah mystical accounts from a pheno-melological perspective. They also trace the possible origin of severalHekhalot and Merkavah themes to specific mythological, ancient NearEastern sources, both biblical and Mesopotamian. They conclude withan analysis of the manner in which ancient mythological images andthemes are interiorized, spiritualized, and reinterpreted in order to con-vey new mystical notions in the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature.Embracing the approach that mystical literature and cultural so-cial realities are bound together, chapter 6 concludes the discussion byconsidering possible cultural and ideological implications of the pre-vious literary and phenomenological observations regarding the con-text of Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism and its authors.

Its goals, religio-spiritual attitudes, practices, rev-elations, and exegetical perceptions demonstrate specific traits which,from a phenomenological perspective, can be characterized as mystical.THE HEKHALOT AND MERKAVAH LITERATUREThe anonymous corpus known as the Hekhalot and Merkavah litera-ture derives its name from two of its principal themes. The first themeinvolves descriptions of visionary heavenly ascents through the sevendivine palaces (Hebrew: Hekhalot). The second theme featuresmeditations and interpretations of the chariot vision (Hebrew:Merkavah).1 The collective title, “Hekhalot and Merkavah lit-erature,” may give the impression of a cohesive corpus of writingswith a specific homogeneous tradition or a consistent religious out-look. This literature, however, is not a unified body of work havingone spiritual approach. On the contrary, the Hekhalot and Merkavahliterature consists of several anonymous and enigmatic manuscripts,each of which includes various literary genres and diverse traditions.2The Hekhalot and Merkavah manuscripts are written in Hebrewand Aramaic with several borrowings from Greek.3 They came intoexistence over an extensive period of time. According to several schol-ars, they took shape in Palestine and Babylonia during the Mishnaicand Talmudic periods of the second and fifth centuries. Others datethis literature to the sixth and the eighth centuries, C.E., the late phaseof the Geonic period.4 These texts involved a long process of writing,editing, and redacting. They have not been preserved in their originaland complete form but are found instead as fragmented manuscriptsand literary units in later sources. A major body of the manuscriptshas been found in medieval Europe, among the writings of the HasideiAshkenaz movement. These manuscripts were edited by members ofthis school at the end of the twelfth and the beginning of the thir-teenth century C.E.5 Hekhalot and Merkavah material has been pre-served as well in the work of early Jewish philosophers from the tenthcentury and in polemic Karaite literature.6 Additional fragments, theauthorship of which is attributed to the ninth century, have been foundin the Cairo Genizah.7 Short segments of the Hekhalot and Merkavahtexts were also included in various Midrashim and in the Babylonianand Jerusalem Talmuds.8The Hekhalot and Merkavah literature is distinctively multifac-eted, presenting complex and sometimes contradictory notions of God,angels, and human beings.9Each manuscript, in fact, may be seen asan anthology of different traditions and subject matters. Cosmological"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The Herkhalot and Merkavah Literature9concepts, magical and theurgical traditions, accounts of visionaryascensions to the celestial world, descriptions of the angelic realm,rituals of adjurations, messianic contemplation, theosophical specu-lations concerning the nature of God, his appearance and the dimen-sions of his divine figure (shi‘ur komah,), are several of thecentral topics which the Hekhalot and Merkavah treatises introducesimultaneously.10The diversity of the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature as well asthe complexity of its texts make difficult any attempt to reach clear,solid conclusions regarding the scope of the corpus, the relationshipsamong its various parts, the time and social climate of its composition,and its dominant characteristics. Questions concerning the literaturehave therefore been disputed in the scholarly literature and manyspeculations have not been definitively proven.11 The following is abrief overview of the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature; its origins,literary traditions, and prevalent themes.HISTORICAL AND SOCIAL BACKGROUNDThe first attempts to anchor the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature ina specific Jewish tradition and to set the historical and chronologicaldate of its compilation were made in the nineteenth century. Severalscholars of that period considered texts of this literature as obscurelate manuscripts which stand outside the normative Judaism of lateantiquity and early Middle Ages. The historian H. H. Graez, for ex-ample, attributed the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature to the post-Talmudic and Midrashic periods. In Graetz’s opinion the literature’sexceptional and irrational themes, such as descriptions of angels,magical formulas, ascents to heaven, and descriptions of the body ofthe divine, could not correctly be seen as the product of legalisticrabbinical Judaism, but rather reflect the presence of Islamic influencefrom sources of the eighth and ninth centuries.12 Other scholars, incontrast, viewed the Hekhalot and Merkavah texts as authentic Jewishwritings from a much earlier date. M. Gaster, considered the Hekhalotand Merkavah literature as a remnant of an ancient school of thoughtdating from the Second Temple period. A. Jellinek regarded the manu-scripts as late homilies, which had not been included in the classicalcollections. He issued several of the treatises in his edition Bet ha-Midrash. S. A. Wertheimer shared a similar attitude and included sev-eral Hekhalot and Merkavah texts in his collection, Batei Midrashot, asdid S. Musajoff, who included Hekhalot and Merkavah texts in hisedition,Merkavah Shelemah.13 In the twenties, H. Odeberg published acritical edition of Sefer Hekhalot, also labeled by him as The Hebrew Bookof Enoch or 3 Enoch. As the title reflects, Odeberg considered the text"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"10Beholders of Divine Secretsto be a part of the ancient apocalyptic Enochic literature from the firstcenturiesB.C.E. and the first century C.E.14G. Scholem’s writings mark the beginning of contemporary aca-demic study of the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature. Scholem andseveral other scholars dated the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature toa much earlier time than had previously been suggested.15 The litera-ture, according to this view, was attributed to mainstream orthodoxRabbinic circles in the Tannaim period, around the turn of the firstcenturyC.E., and then developed in various ways during the followingsix or seven centuries.16 These conclusions have been challenged byseveral scholars. E. E. Urbach and D. J. Halperin have shown differ-ences between the Hekhalot and Merkavah tradition and that of Rab-binic Judaism, in which they have not found any trace of mysticalactivity but rather that of a homilitical midrashic study of Ezekiel’schariot.17 M. S. Cohen, P. S. Alexander, and M. D. Swartz have arguedthat different Hekhalot and Merkavah texts and literary units cannotbe dated to the first centuries C.E. Instead, they contend these textstook shape over several centuries in Palestine between the earlyAmoraic period and the post-Talmudic time in Babylonia.18Not only the chronological dating of the Hekhalot and Merkavahliterature remains unclear, but also the identity and the social-histori-cal background of its authors or compilers. No clear answers can bededuced from the literature itself.19 Well-known Tannaitic figures suchas Rabbi Ishmael, Rabbi Akiva, and Rabbi Nehunia ben Ha-Kanah arepresented in the various narratives as main speakers, yet the informa-tion they communicate often conflicts with documented historical data.Their descriptions relate primarily to an imaginary reality, and theirviews frequently contradict the accepted traditional norms of theMishnaic and Talmudic periods of the second and fifth centuries C.E.20Diverse theories have been suggested to determine the writers’identities. Members of a mystical school, originating in Palestine inTannaitic and Talmudic times, were considered by Scholem to be theearly authors of the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature, which laterextended to Babylonia and subsequently to Europe. P. Schäfer seesthis literature as an expression of an elite post-rabbinic group of schol-ars, originating in Babylonia. “People of the land,” including unedu-cated lower class rebels from a younger generation, were the writersof this literature, according to Halperin. This group challenged the oldrabbinic authorities, making theurgic use of the Sar Torah traditions ofthe Hekhalot and Merkavah in order to gain a higher social status andauthority. Associating the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature withmagical literature J. R. Davila considered professional scribes as thecomposers of the literature. Lacking formal rabbinic training and vener-able social status, they challenged the Rabbis with magic. In a recent"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The Herkhalot and Merkavah Literature11study he has identified the people behind the Hekhalot and Merkavahliterature as practitioners of ritual power, compared to shamans andshamans/healers. Swartz sees the authors as educated groups who lackedformal rabbinic training. These groups, placed between the elite and thecommon lower classes, were found in circles of synagogue functionar-ies, liturgical poets and professional scribes. R. Elior situates the Hekhalotand Merkavah literature in the context of priestly-angelic lore. She at-tributes it to members of priestly circles, whose concern was to preserveand reconstruct Temple traditions after its destruction as well as totransform the imperceptible divinity into a perceivable order.21The cultural-historical background of Hekhalot and Merkavah lit-erature has also been studied from various angles. As scholars havedemonstrated, the literature shares many characteristics with severalmajor religious movements which flourished in the same cultural cli-mate both within Judaism and outside of it. Similarities have beendrawn on the level of the general structure of ideas and as well on thelevel of detailed literary motifs and themes. In addition to the connec-tion of this literature with the Talmudic and Midrashic literature,22interdependence between Hekhalot and Merkavah hymnology andJewish traditional prayers has been documented, and significant im-pact of priestly-angelic traditions from the First and Second Templeperiods on the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature has been demon-strated.23 The Hekhalot and Merkavah literature has also been linkedto several other traditions and texts from a similar cultural environ-ment. These include apocryphal and apocalyptic literature,24 theQumran texts,25 Gnostic traditions,26 and early Christian literature.27Connections between several Hekhalot and Merkavah traditions andvarious Jewish and Greco-Roman magical traditions of late antiquityhave been studied as well.28SCHOLARLY EDITIONS AND METHODOLOGICAL APPROACHESFrom the middle of the nineteenth century several Hekhalot andMerkavah manuscripts were published by Jellinek, Wertheimer, andMusajoff.29 In the twenties, the first critical edition of a Hekhalot andMerkavah manuscript, Sefer Hekhalot, was published by H. Odeberg,who also labeled it The Hebrew Book of Enoch or 3 Enoch.30 Criticaleditions of specific manuscripts and literary units were published laterby scholars such as P. S. Alexander, M. S. Cohen, R. Elior, I. Gruenwald,K. Hermann, and G. Scholem.31 In the late 1970’s P. Schäfer suggesteda different approach to the study of the manuscripts. Questioning theconvention of separating the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature intofixed, defined, and independent textual units and books, Schäfer andhis colleagues published a synoptic edition of the Hekhalot andMerkavah literature. This edition is composed of seven manuscripts"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"12Beholders of Divine Secretsfrom medieval European sources, presented in one sequence and di-vided into nine hundred and thirty orderly, consecutive paragraphs. Alater edition of the Hekhalot and Merkavah texts, also published bySchäfer, comprises twenty-three fragments from the Cairo Genizah. Pho-tographs of the texts, comments, explanations and references to otherrelated Hekhalot and Merkavah sources are also part of this edition.32In several discussions, Schäfer has promoted the historical-textualapproach to the study of the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature. Inthese, he has emphasized the greater importance of clarifying ques-tions regarding the relationships among the manuscripts and varioustextual units over the lesser importance of the study of their particularcharacteristics.33 Other scholars, in contrast, have suggested employ-ing an overall contextual-phenomenological perspective in order toexplore the unique attributes of the literature. This second approachtreats the literature as a corpus with a common spiritual outlook anda shared literary heritage, reflected in the various texts, despite obvi-ous differences and contradictions. Scholars have appropriately adoptedthematic, contextual, phenomenological, and historical approaches asfruitful methods for analyzing the manuscripts. These methods allowmajor conceptual themes and outlooks found in the literature to bedistinguished and assessed.34Among the various conceptual themes and phenomenological fea-tures of this literature, its mystical teachings, principles, and ideashave been the topic of much discussion in significant studies. Thisstudy, as well, focuses on the Hekhalot and Merkavah mystical tradi-tion. Recognizing mysticism as one of many notions of this multilay-ered literature, it seeks to explore its specific features. As anintroduction, it is thus pertinent to discuss two topics, the nature ofmystical literature in general, and of the Hekhalot and Merkavahmystical literature in particular.MYSTICISM IN THE HEKHALOT AND MERKAVAH LITERATURERecent scholarship presents two primary approaches to the studyof mysticism in the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature. On the onehand, several scholars claim that this literature contains records ofgenuine otherworldly experiences, preparatory techniques, and rev-elations, all seen as its mystical core. In Scholem’s opinion, forexample, the soul’s ascent to heaven and its attainment of God isthe dominant mystical concept of this literature. It reveals evidenceof ecstatic visionary experiences which later degenerated into magi-cal writings. I. Gruenwald likewise associates mysticism in this lit-erature exclusively with ascent traditions. J. Dan identifies three"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The Herkhalot and Merkavah Literature13types of mystical elements in the literature, among which the as-cent to the Merkavah is the most significant. In Elior ’s view, themystical aspects of this literature are represented by a new conceptof divinity as well as by the practice of ascent to heaven. K. E.Grözinger highlights the mystical ascent as well as mystical prepa-ratory techniques and stages.35On the other hand, some scholars assert that the Hekhalot andMerkavah literature includes merely literary constructions, which donot reveal authentic mystical experiences and practices. Urbach andHalperin, for instance, maintain this view, arguing that the ascent themeshould not be regarded as the primary aspect of this literature, whichreflects mostly literary developments. Schäfer argues that the litera-ture does not provide any indication of how the heavenly ascent wascarried out, or even if it was practiced at all. M. Himmelfarb assetsthat the literature includes stories to be repeated and not descriptionsof tenable experiences and rites.36This dichotomy between the experimental and the exegeticalaspects of the Hekhalot and Merkavah mystical tradition has beenchallenged recently in several studies. Alexander discusses the inter-dependency of these two aspects in any study of Hekhalot andMerkavah mysticism and asserts: “from early on in the movementboth ‘theoretical’ (i.e. exegetical) and ‘practical’ (i.e. experimental)approaches to the Merkabah were followed.”37 Rejecting any distinc-tion between the two E. R. Wolfson states: “Such a distinction is predi-cated on the ability to isolate phenomenologically an experienceseparated from its literal context—a questionable presumption, inas-much as all such experiences occur within a literary framework.38This approach parallels a prevalent view according to which theacademic access to mystical teachings, experiences, revelations, anddoctrines of any mystical school is available mainly through its lit-erary writings. Scholars have argued in support of this claim, main-taining that only the literary records give expression to mysticalnotions and enable students of mysticism to explore their meaning,thus, the analysis of mysticism is primarily textually based. S. T.Katz makes this observation very clearly, asserting that the key tounderstanding mystical phenomena in general is through analysis ofits literary evidence:There are no pure (i.e., unmediated) experiences. Neithermystical experience nor more ordinary forms of experiencegive any indication, or any grounds for believing, that theyare unmediated. That is to say all experience is processedthrough, organized by, and makes itself available to us inextremely complex epistemological ways.39"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"14Beholders of Divine SecretsSharing this perspective, scholars such as R. M. Gimello, P. Moore, andC. A. Keller assert that mystical writings form the only data for anyanalysis of mysticism. The study of mysticism appears, therefore, to beprimarily literary, philological, and exegetical.40 In his investigation ofmystical phenomena, B. McGinn’s perception accords with this per-spective: “The only thing directly available to the historian or histori-cal theologian is the evidence, largely in the form of written records.”41This approach to the study of mysticism seems to be particu-larly valid in the case of the Hekhalot and Merkavah mystical tra-dition. In its enigmatic and fractured collection of literary texts, wedo not find records of pure, unmediated mystical experiences orrevelations, presented as verified, firsthand, personal testimony.Instead, the many Hekhalot and Merkavah passages provide a richtapestry of theoretical literary descriptions and of first, second, orthird hand pseudepigraphical testimonies of visionary experiencesand revelations, which demonstrate certain mystical characteristics.These writings may present records of authentic experiences trans-lated into words. They may also be bound up with accepted tradi-tional norms, or based on literary conventions shared by a specificgroup.42 Since the literary texts, in their present form, constitute ouronly link to Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism of late antiquity,the pure nature of authentic mystical experiences, their validity, orthe accuracy and correctness of reported mystical claims are topicswhich stand beyond the scope of our investigation. Instead, througha careful analysis of the written data, substantial insights into thenature of the Hekhalot and Merkavah mystical tradition and itsspecial traits can be achieved.43WHAT IS MEANT BY MYSTICISMAs we approach Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism through a studyof its literature, we need to discern the term mysticism, as well as tospecify which parts of the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature exhibitnotions and outlooks which could be characterized as mystical. Themany studies of mysticism make clear that every examination of thiswide phenomenon defies any clear-cut attempt at its definition. Mys-ticism is a phenomenological concept, coined by Western scholars,which refers to various types of teachings, experiences, and goals ofvaried spiritual trends.44 Deeply influenced by the perspectives, back-grounds, and interests of its scholars, the definitions and classificationsof mysticism are numerous and diverse. Rather than distinguishingwhat mysticism is, this study focuses on several of its characteristicqualities, denoted from a phenomenological perspective, which are ofparticular interest for this investigation of the Hekhalot and Merkavah"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The Herkhalot and Merkavah Literature15tradition. Beneficial observations on these aspects are offered byMcGinn in his discussion of the heuristic nature of mysticism:When I speak of mysticism as involving an immediate con-sciousness of the presence of God, I am trying to highlighta central claim that appears in almost all mystical texts.Mystics continue to affirm that their mode of access to Godis radically different from that found in ordinary conscious-ness, even from the awareness of God gained through theusual religious activities.. . . As believers, they affirm thatGod does become present in these activities, but not in anydirect or immediate fashion. Mystical religious texts are thosethat witness to another form of divine presence, one thatcan, indeed, sometimes be attained within the context ofordinary religious observances, but which need not be. Whatdifferentiates it from another form of religious conscious-ness is its presentation as both subjectively and objectivelymore direct, even at times as immediate.45McGinn’s observation highlights several distinctive principles,which are significant for the study of Hekhalot and Merkavah mysti-cism. This observation expands the notion of mysticism, recognizingthat the unio mystica model is not its only characteristic feature, andthe principle of union with God does not embody its sole essence.Acknowledging alternative mystical models McGinn perceives a stateof an immediate consciousness of the presence of God as pivotal andfurther contends:. . . union is only one of the host of models, metaphors, orsymbols that mystics have employed in their accounts. Manyhave used it, but few have restricted themselves to it. Amongthe other major mystical categories are those of contempla-tion and the vision of God, deification . . . ecstasy. All of thesecan be conceived of as different but complementary ways ofpresenting the consciousness of direct presence.46Several additional conceptual and ideological traits are suggested byMcGinn’s observation presented above. References to specific conscious-ness of the presence of God demonstrate a claim that there is an alter-native realm of absolute divine entity, or ultimate reality, beyond thephenomenological world, which can be attained by human seekers.The mystical awareness is different from the awareness of God gainedthrough the usual religious activities and thus, the attainment ofthe divine, according to this view, often occurs outside the frame-work of established, traditional religious life. In his discussion ofthe nature of mysticism, Dan similarly observes: “There is an alter-native, nonsensual, and nonlogical way of achieving truth, the via"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"16Beholders of Divine Secretsmystica, which can lead the mystic . . . to embrace some aspects of thehidden truth.”47McGinn’s account also emphasizes the internal mental realm ofhuman consciousness, on which both the spiritual quest and its at-tained revelations occur. It highlights unique spiritual perception,awareness, and state of mind, radically different from that found inordinary states of being, that influence the ways in which the ultimatedivine reality is attained. J. E. Collins’ observation, presented from aphenomenological-psycological perspective, further elucidates thisaspect:One who subjects himself/herself to the discipline requiredof the mystic path, either by self effort or by submission toa spiritual guide, experience, as a result of his/her dedica-tion to this discipline, radical change within his/her con-sciousness. This transformation of consciousness may bemanifested in a new epistemology, cosmology, ontology,soteriology, and so forth.48The significance of such human’s states of consciousness, indirectly,also indicates another characteristic of the mystical phenomena—theprivate, introspective nature of the mystical process, which seems tobe, primarily, of personal concern. D. Merkur ’s view of mysticismadvances this aspect:What, in my opinion, finally distinguishes mystics from othertypes of religious ecstatic is their standing in society. Sha-mans, mediums, and prophets are public social functionar-ies who act on behalf of their coreligionists in contactingtheir gods or spirits. Coreligionists may perform similarpractices for personal or private reasons. Mystics tend toseek experiences of exclusively private concern. Private ori-entations may be achieved through religious experiences ofmany different type, mystical union is merely one example.In all cases, it is the inward turn, due to the impossibility ofpossessing public religious authority, that I think character-izes mysticism wherever it is found.Finally, McGinn’s observation denotes the significance of religious texts,through which mystical notions are conveyed. Recognizing literatureas a source in which mystical concepts are described, expressed, andcommunicated verbally, this assertion denies a previous, commonlyreceived view about the absolute nature of mystical ineffability. In asimilar vein C. A. Keller notes: “Mystical writings are . . . texts whichdiscuss the path towards realization of the ultimate knowledge . . . andwhich contain statements about the nature of such knowledge.”50"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"The Herkhalot and Merkavah Literature17McGinn’s reference to religious texts also indicates, it seems, thesignificance of an exclusive religious perspective, from which experi-ences and revelations are decoded and presented in the textual sources.Spiritual awareness of other realities is thus related as a mystical con-sciousness of the presence of God. Merkur’s observation, directs atten-tion to the specific nature of mystical states of mind:Mystical experiences are religious uses of otherwise secularalternate states of consciousness—or more precisely, alter-nate psychic states. What makes an alternate state experi-ence a religious one is its personal or cultural valuation.51The subsequent chapters of this study examine in detail the intri-cate manner in which these notions, characterized as mystical, arepresented in the distinct context and terminology of the Hekhalot andMerkavah mysticism. The following discussion of this chapter, as anintroduction, briefly describes the presence of such notions in specificsources of the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature. It intends to demar-cate its mystical writings and to outline their prominent features.THE HEKHALOT AND MERKAVAH MYSTICAL LITERATURESeveral of the Hekhalot and Merkavah literary texts are regarded asforming the main mystical core of the literature: Hekhalot Rabbati (TheGreater Book of Hekhalot), Hekhalot Zutarti (The Lesser Book ofHekhalot ), Ma’aseh Merkavah (The Works of the Chariot ), Sefer Hekhalot(The Book of Hekhalot), also known as the Hebrew Book of Enoch or 3Enoch, the Shi’ur Komah texts (Measurements of the Divine Body),various fragments relating to Metatron known as Shivah Metatron andseveralGenizah fragments.52Descriptions in Hekhalot Rabbati present an account of RabbiIshmael’s journey to heaven in order to find out if the death decree often prominent Jewish sages was decided by God.53 Rabbi Nehunia benHa-Kanah’s ecstatic ascent is similarly recorded. The text also outlinesvarious stages of the visionary ascent, paradoxically designated in thetexts as the “descent to the Merkavah,” including its goals, techniques,and revelations.54 Depiction of the upper worlds, the divine chariot,and the angelic rituals are provided.Hekhalot Zutarti relates Rabbi Akiva’s ascent to the upper heavens,delineated in a version of the story of “four who entered the Pardes,”found also in the Tosefta, the Talmud, and the Midrash. Rabbi Akiva’saccomplishments are highlighted as he is compared to the other threesages who “entered the Pardes.”55 Their harsh fate illustrates indirectlythe risks of the journey as well as the ways in which to avoid them.Rabbi Akiva also describes his vision of ascending to heaven, and"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"18Beholders of Divine Secretsinstructs members of Merkavah group who wish to ascend. This liter-ary tradition also makes references to Moses, portrayed as an ancientmystic who ascended on high to behold God.56 The text also offersdetails concerning spiritual goals and specific methods and practicesdesigned, it seems, to influence the adept’s awareness and to induceecstasies. It narrates the stages of the visionary ecstatic journey, includ-ing its dangers and challenges. Divine revelations are also disclosed.57Ma’aseh Merkavah provides information concerning spiritual goals,techniques, visionary ascents to the chariot, and spiritual achieve-ments.58 It includes general descriptions, songs, hymns, and prayers,recited by the Merkavah seekers before God, as well as a few accountspresented as their personal testaments.Sefer Hekhalot, known as 3 Enoch or The Hebrew Book of Enoch, re-ports Rabbi Ishmael ‘s ascent to the highest seventh heaven and re-counts his encounter with the Prince of the Countenance, Metatron,who shows him the structure and secrets of the divine world. Theaccount details the personal experiences and spiritual transformationwhich Rabbi Ishmael undergoes before he enters the divine realm. Thestory of Enoch, son of Jared, the human being who was transformedinto the divine archangel Metatron, echoes Rabbi Ishmael’s account. Itoffers additional data concerning the voyage from the phenomeno-logical to the transcendent world, the final transformation at the endof the path, and the nature of divine revelations.59TheShi’ur Komah traditions consist largely of visions of the mani-fested, anthropomorphic image of God.60 They also incorporate subtleexegetical interpretations of these revelations, presented from a specificspiritual viewpoint as will be demonstrated. Finally, several Genizahfragments from Cairo add various details, mainly about the visionaryjourney and its entailed revelations.All these Hekhalot and Merkavah accounts present, in a distinc-tive language and vocabulary, several particular features, which reacha level of explicit literary formulation. These are closely related to themystical notions discussed above. The Hekhalot and Merkavah mys-tical accounts claim the existence of an alternative realm of ultimatereality which stands beyond the physical phenomenological world.Seen from a specific religious perspective, this sphere is classified interms such as the Heaven of Heavens, the King’s palaces, or God’sMerkavah (chariot). These traditions, likewise, acknowledge an innercontemplative process of attaining the absolute achieved by humanseekers. This experience is depicted as visionary contemplative jour-neys out of this world to celestial realms. The members of the Merkavahcircle undergo a series of mental inner stages, through which severalqualified individuals acquire a unique spiritual perception, awareness,"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The Herkhalot and Merkavah Literature19and consciousness. This state enables them to attain the divine realityin a personal direct manner, which seems to be of private concerns.They see God’s celestial palaces, behold the King at his beauty, andgaze at the Merkavah.As mentioned earlier, in these Hekhalot and Merkavah diverseliterary accounts, we find no consistent information regarding mysti-cal concepts. In none of the writings can we find an attempt to conveymystical ideas in a methodical fashion, or to introduce a coherent andsystematic mystical doctrine. On the contrary, complex references tovarious mystical teachings, practices, visions, revelations, and exegesisare present in the nonhomogeneous Hekhalot and Merkavah literarygenres. They are transcribed in multiple modes of expression andcomposed from diverse perspectives as records of inner experiencesand visions, as well as theoretical information, general descriptions,narratives, and instructions.We read reports revealed as the mystics’ testaments during theexperience.61 Likewise, the mystics’ later reflections of their experi-ences are recorded, as well as reports and explanations from a thirdperson’s perspective.62 Theoretical teachings or what seem to be nar-rations of exemplary mystical principles are also found in theHekhalot and Merkavah literature.63 Narratives, such as the “Pardesstory” or the “account of the ten martyrs,” also provide references tomystical concepts, as well as direct dialogues between teacher anddisciple, and general instructions, directed to the people who aspireto engage in specific spiritual quests.64 Poetic forms, expressiveprayers, exegetical interpretations of mystical visions are additionalliterary genres which manifest mystical concepts in the Hekhalotand Merkavah literature.65Both the variety of sources and the lack of consistency clearlychallenge attempts to draw precise and decisive conclusions regardingthe nature of Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism. It is important, how-ever, to note the advantages of such a broad and richly layered litera-ture. Consideration of the many-sided mystical literature of anytradition, followed by an analysis of its significant literary genres, cancontribute to a wide understanding of this specific mystical tradition.The broad range of significant literary texts, genres, and forms do notobscure the investigation. Rather, they reveal its many aspects, phases,and outlooks, and can be of great value for comprehending the com-plexity of any specific mystical tradition.

Furthermore, the breadthof this literature exhibits corresponding notions found in several of itsliterary accounts.

From a literary-penomenological perspec-tive, it will seek to distinguish the specific mystical characteristics ofthis tradition, in light of current observations and methodologicalpremises in the study of mysticism. The discussion will first classifysignificant aspects present in Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism, boththeoretical and practical. It will then demonstrate the ways in whichthese notions interact as they create a distinct mystical tradition. Inparticular, attention will be paid to the interplay between mysticaltechniques, ritualistic practices, spiritual transformation, and innerperceptions on the one hand, and divine revelations and the interpre-tations, which they entail, on the other hand.A COMMON MODELVisions appear. . . as interior projections or visualizations ofthe respective community’s myth-dream which the subjecthas chosen, consciously or unconsciously, as his own per-sonal myth-dream.1"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"22Beholders of Divine Secrets. . . for the people of the world, for you, and for everyone whowishes to descend and gaze at the King in His beauty. Heshould take this path and descend, and he will not be harmed.2In the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature many descriptions overlapor correspond in content. At the same time accounts and details invarious treatises diverge and vary. Yet, with regard to the mysticalaspects of this literature, it is possible to assert with confidence thatthe diverse voices do not contradict each other. Despite some incon-sistency, the different references to mystical notions do not create acontroversial tension within the various texts and redactions of thismanifold literature. Rather they complement each other presentingvarious angles of one common tradition. In this tradition we candiscern a multilevel model, reflecting both theoretical and experi-mental aspects.3Parallel Hekhalot and Merkavah accounts present collective mys-tical assumptions, goals, religio-spiritual attitudes and practices. Theseare shared by righteous heroes of the remote legendary-mythologicalpast, such as Moses and Enoch. These same teachings may also beembraced by worthy visionaries of a more recent past, such as RabbiIshmael, Rabbi Akiva, and Rabbi Nehunia ben Ha-Kanah, as well asby deserving visionaries of the circle of Yordei Merkavah (descendersto the chariot) in the present and future. It is clear that adepts of anyage may follow the same path, undergo parallel prescribed experi-ences, and gain corresponding experiences of encountering the divinein the context of their own historical conditions, geographical loca-tions, and chronological time.The different literary traditions, moreover, seem to portray a similar“ideal type” or role model who represents an image of a exemplary mysticof this specific circle. Such models represent, in a variety of ways, severalcategorical norms for their community. Since models often manifest theproper religious attitude and moral-spiritual disposition, their conductbecomes heuristic. They assert a practical way of following the theoreticalteaching; they provide an authoritative confirmation of the possibilitythat human beings, under special circumstances, can experience divinereality in a personal, direct manner. They also disclose a specific interpre-tation to the revealed divine reality.4Although several different individuals are depicted in the Hekhalotand Merkavah accounts as ideal mystics, they all seem to mirror eachother and to play corresponding roles. Enoch is introduced in 3 Enochas a model for Rabbi Ishmael as well as for all the descenders to thechariot. Moses is delineated in Hekhalot Zutarti as the prototype for"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Hekhalot and Merkavah Mysticism23Rabbi Akiva and all future visionaries. Rabbi Ishmael, Rabbi Akiva,and Rabbi Nehunia ben Ha-Kanah are presented throughout this lit-erature as models for all worthy and qualified mystics who are ex-pected to follow their pattern.5 These models demonstrate a clearstandard of perfection, acknowledged by members of the Hekhalotand Merkavah circle. They embody as well an example of the suitableattitude and practice, to be followed by dedicated adepts. As bothtemporal and trans-temporal figures, these individuals are introducednot only as historical but also as contemporary models, whose teach-ings endure and remain valid and heuristic for committed adepts ineach succeeding generation.A description in the Genizah illustrates this notion of a sharedsystem. It refers to a common and established mystical path whichleads to an optimal destination, as well as to an ideal type of a seeker,who wishes to reach such a destination, to experience the divine realm,and to behold celestial visions in a proper manner:You should write and set the Seal of the Descent to theMerkavah for the people of the world, for you, and foreveryone who wishes to descend and gaze at the king inHis beauty. He should take this path and descend, and see,and he will not be harmed.6The discussion below will examine the mystical tradition of theHekhalot and Merkavah literature and its particular features. The thesiswe will examine is as follows. Several different accounts, in them-selves often ambiguous and fragmentary, include a variety of refer-ences to mystical notions. These references, when considered together,complete each other and present a distinct shared mystical tradition.According to this tradition, the highest aim is that of gaining directexperience of God and the divine reality. This goal appears to be de-pendent upon the visionaries’ inner awareness and spiritual develop-ment on the one hand, and on their perception and exegetical abilityon the other.More specifically, according to several Hekhalot and Merkavahaccounts, the ultimate goal of the seekers’ spiritual journey is to “be-hold the king in his beauty” and to “gaze at the visions of theMerkavah.” These goals seem to express a mystical aspiration to en-counter God and to perceive the nature of concealed divine reality.Such objectives are not achieved easily. Before divine visions and rev-elations are granted, adepts undergo a complex process of an ethical,spiritual, and mental metamorphosis. They expand their perceptionbeyond its ordinary limits and in so doing gain a new awareness."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"24Beholders of Divine SecretsCrossing of conceptual boundaries lead them into the divine realm.They behold visions and revelations from a mystical perspective andcan recognize and interpret their concealed meanings. In this way, fora short period of time, human perception and divine reality corre-spond and become one. During such mystical encounters visionariescan offer an exegesis of hidden truths, know God directly, and corre-spondingly share the divine perspective.7 From this viewpoint it seemsthat the complex notion of “beholding divine visions” is, in fact, thecore of the Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism.The discussion below will demonstrate this observation. It willexplore parallel accounts of Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism whichpresent aspects such as its goal, methods, stages, spiritual transforma-tion, divine revelation, and their exegetical interpretation, as intercon-nected components of one spiritual path.THE MYSTICAL GOALBasic to mystic awareness is the claim that attitudinal purification is necessary for right perception.What one knows is closely related to how one knows.To see beyond the apparent, or superficial world meansa change in the mechanism of apprehension.8When will he descend, he who descends to the Merkavah?When will he see the heavenly majesty? . . .When will he see what no eye has ever seen?9Distinct biblical and rabbinical views often presuppose the exist-ence of boundaries between celestial and terrestrial domains, aswell as between human beings and the divine. These boundariesare not to be crossed. Human attempts to push the limits, encoun-ter God’s realm, and see his visible appearance are often heavilyrestricted or prohibited altogether. These views are expressed, forexample, in Psalm 115: 16: “The heavens are the Lord’s heaven butthe earth he has given to human beings.” So, too, we hear God sayin Exodus 33:20: “You will not see my face, for no man can see meand live.” According to prevalent biblical and later post-biblicaland rabbinical sources, likewise significant encounters between Godand his people were divinely initiated.They occurred on theterrestial, historical realm, in specific occasions, in which God re-vealed his words to messengers, such as angelic figures, or proph-ets. The most famous event is the revelation at Mt. Sinai. Then, onone unique occasion, God communicated to Moses and the commu-nity his ultimate teachings, which were embodied into the Torahand the commandments.10"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Hekhalot and Merkavah Mysticism25In several of the Hekhalot and Merkavah writings a differentspiritual outlook finds expression. The communication between Godand human beings is not limited to a unique divine revelation and itscontinuous manifestation in the Torah. Likewise, human encounterswith God are no longer divinely initiated and proclaimed to peoplemerely through prophetic or angelic mediators. Instead, Hekhalot andMerkavah mysticism emphasizes a personal visionary praxis of attain-ing God, constituted by humans. According to this tradition a humanbeing, under certain conditions, can experience a visionary—ecstaticencounter with God, see concealed celestial visions, and understand,independently, the meaning of such revelations.11 Contrary to predomi-nant views, such an occurrence is not presented as an outcome of thedivine’s initiative. Instead, it is the visionary’s own decisions, spiritualexercises, personal deeds, and inner awareness which lead to thisencounter. This experience is often expressed in many of the Hekhalotand Merkavah passages by expressions such as “beholding the king inhis beauty,” and “gazing at the visions of the Merkavah.”In its presentation of such ventures, the Hekhalot and Merkavahmysticism parallels other ancient Mediterranean religions. In thesetoo diverse forms of encounter with the divine, especially throughheavenly journeys, are prominent.12 Although it is beyond the scopeof this study to compare the complex traditions of celestial journeys,nonetheless it is important to emphasize their distinct presentationin the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature, before we develop thisanalysis further. Journeys to heaven, according to many Hekhalotand Merkavah accounts, are not dependent upon the divine’s will.Instead, human beings, under certain conditions, can initiate a voy-age out of this world. Not only do the visionaries’ own decisionsconstitute the heavenly ascents, but also their personal deeds, per-ception, and inner awareness affect the outcome of such journeys.Seekers who ascend to heaven are concerned with eschatologicalrevelations, and deterministic plans of future history to a degree.Personal encounters with God and the divine realm, however, seemto be their principal aspiration. Adepts primarily long to behold Godand the Merkavah, in a visionary journey to heaven which takesplace during their lifetimes.Repeated statements in Hekhalot Zutarti,Hekhalot Rabbati,Ma’asehMerkavah,3 Enoch, Shi’ur Komah, and in the Genizah fragments an-nounce this foremost goal of the seekers in a similar fashion. Thevisionaries, Rabbi Ishmael, Rabbi Akiva, and Rabbi Nehunia ben Ha-Kanah, wish to “ascend to heaven and behold the king in his palace,”“gaze upon the vision of the Merkavah,” “look at the Merkavah,”“catch sight of the heaven of heavens,” “view a glimpse of the chariot,”"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"26Beholders of Divine Secrets“catch sight of the Mighty One,” or “behold the King in his beauty.”13The various drafted parallel terms and images introduce a basic mys-tical premise of the Hekhalot and Merkavah tradition. The divine re-ality, denoted metaphorically as “the Merkavah,” the “Chambers ofGod,” “Heaven of Heavens,” and the “Divine Palaces,” is perceived asan incomprehensible transcendent realm, the perception of which isnormally beyond human capacity.The ultimate aspiration of the Hekhalot seekers is restated byanalogous verbs such as “gazing,” “beholding,” “seeing,” or “watch-ing.” These corresponding verbs apparently function as technical termsin the literature. They convey, in similar terminology, the adepts’ de-sire to be able to access the divine realm. For example, Rabbi Akivadescribes his elevated divine revelation, referring to the time when he“caught sight of the Mighty One.”14 Rabbi Ishmael, in a similar man-ner, asks about the process which leads one to be able to “behold thevision of the Merkavah.”15 He also recounts his highest spiritual expe-rience using similar terminology: “I saw the King of the Kings sittingon a high and exalted throne, and his servants were attending him onhis right and on his left.”16Many statements in various Hekhalot literary texts suggest thatthis ultimate aim, namely attaining the divine by beholding his vision,is a conceivable and permissible goal.17 Not only is it the final aspira-tion of the mystics’ quest, but also God himself, as confirmed in sev-eral accounts, wishes to be seen. He longs for the exceptional, qualifiedadept who can cross the boundaries between the phenomenologicaland the transcendent realms, ascend to heaven and see divine revela-tions, which are concealed from both mortal and angelic eyes:TWTRWSY'Y YHWH, God of Israel, yearns and waits . . .When will he descend, he who descends to the Merkavah?When will he see the pride of high?When will he see the end of salvation?When will he hear the end of wonders?When will he see what no eye has ever seen?When will he ascend and attest beforethe seed of Abraham, His beloved . . .18Those, moreover, who gain visions of the Merkavah are required toreport to their confidants and describe the awesome and gloriousdivine sights:A heavenly punishment on you, descenders to the Merkavah,if you do not tell and say what you have heard; and if youdo not testify what you have seen about the countenance ofexaltation, might, pride and glory.19"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Hekhalot and Merkavah Mysticism27According to these Hekhalot and Merkavah perceptions, attainingGod’s realm and experiencing his presence by beholding his visionsseem to be the ultimate desire of both God and the descenders to thechariot. Yet conflicting statements in several sources deny this option.Narrations in certain passages maintain an alternative, more tradi-tional view, namely that God and human beings are forever separate.Although a few exceptional people are capable of crossing the bound-aries, the act of passing from one realm to another is seen in theseaccounts as problematic and dangerous to both human and divinecreatures. Angelic beings must undergo vigorous preparations such aspurifying themselves in a river of fire before they return from whatseems to be the profane Earth to the pure heavens.20 Likewise, humanbeings are generally prevented from approaching God by fierce celes-tial guards, who stand at every heavenly gate in order to block accessto the divine sphere:At the entrance to the seventh palace stand and rage all mightyones, ruthless, powerful, and hard, terrible, and frightening,higher than mountains and sharper than hills. Their bows arestrung before the countenance; their swords polished in theirhands. Bolts of lightning emanate from their eyeballs, chan-nels of fire from their noses, and torches of coal from theirmouths. They are adorned (with) helmets and armors; lancesand spears hanging on their arms adorn them.21Not only is the act of crossing the boundaries very harmful, butalso the attempt of beholding the divine is itself particularly danger-ous. Human beings and angels alike are restricted from seeing God.Destructive consequences and terrifying effects are anticipated for thosewho dare:Of no creature are the eyes able to gaze at Him, not the eyesof flesh and blood, and not the eyes of his servants, and theone who does gaze at Him, and peers and sees, his eyeballsare seized and turned, and his eyeballs emit and shoot forthtorches of fire, and they scorch him and they burn him.22These conflicting attitudes suggest two different approaches. Behold-ing God and the Merkavah is at once a supreme goal, which is en-couraged and desired, and an option which is absolutely prohibitedand denied.This paradox has been the topic of much study by scholars. G.Scholem makes a distinction between the transcendent God and hisvisible appearance. He argues that God’s glory, the “kavod” () isonly the revealed aspect of the divine, which becomes visible to theMerkavah mystics.23 This observation gained support from other scholars"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"28Beholders of Divine Secretssuch as I. Gruenwald, who claims: “Despite the daring modes of expres-sion, one can find in that literature about the contents of the mysticalexperience, that the possibility of a direct visual encounter with God isgenerally ruled out.”24 R. Elior pays particular attention to the unusualquality of the vision and the uniqueness of the human perception duringthe experience. She states: “The vision described is not a human vision,which is forbidden, but rather a momentary glimpse of enlightenmentthrough super-sensory perception.”25 The human possibility, however, ofbeholding and understanding divine visions is limited, according to Elior.She argues further that the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature establishesclear boundaries that limit or prohibit human exegesis of divine visions,and contends that the traveler actually sees the Merkavah, and not Godhimself.26 P. Schäfer examines this issue in light of dialectical hidden andmanifest aspects of God, and interprets God’s names as his revealedaspect.27 According to I. Chernus, the vision of God is restricted in orderto avoid its destructive effects on the visionary.28 E. R. Wolfson associatesthe vision of God with the adepts’ quasi-deification or angelification,expressed through the image of enthronement in heaven: “it is by virtueof the enthronement that the mystic can see which is ordinarily concealedfrom both human and angelic eyes.”29These and other suggestions have been advanced by scholars toexplain the seeming contradiction between a transcendent or imma-nent vision of the divine. From a different perspective this contradic-tion can be resolved by regarding the imperceptibility or inaccessibilityof God as a stage in the adepts’ awareness. God cannot be seen orunderstood by most human beings in their normal mortal state. Forsome he becomes accessible when they reach a certain level of aware-ness, which is different from ordinary consciousness. The ability “tobehold,” however, is gained during a long spiritual voyage. Seeingvisions of God and experiencing the presence of the divine is thus theultimate aspiration and the outcome of the journey.In his discourse on the nature of mystical awareness of the divine,mentioned above, B. McGinn makes an insightful observation whichis relevant in context of the Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism:When I speak of mysticism as involving an immediate con-sciousness of the presence of God, I am trying to highlight acentral claim that appears in almost all mystical texts. Mysticscontinue to affirm that their mode of access to God is radi-cally different from that found in ordinary consciousness.30It seems that various Hekhalot and Merkavah accounts refer to the actof beholding in these terms.

Thisoption is limited, however, and dependent on the mystics. The desireto behold a vision of the divine can be achieved only if they expandtheir human perspective and develop their spiritual ability “to see”visions, as well as to comprehend their concealed meaning. Whenadepts reach this stage, they can grasp divine truths hidden behindappearances, perceive God’s abstract qualities through his manifestedvision, and interpret the meaning of such revelations, as Rabbi Akiva’sstatement at the opening of Hekhalot Zutarti suggests:If you want to single yourself out in the world so that thesecrets of the world and the mysteries of wisdom will berevealed to you, study this teaching and be careful with ituntil the day of departure. Do not try to understand what liesbehind you and do not investigate the words of your lips.You will understand what is in your heart and keep silent, sothat you will attain the beauty of the Merkavah.31This statement pronounces the privilege of seeing divine revela-tions as a process involving specific internal attitudes, spiritual per-ception, and proper comprehension, in addition to traditional religiousproficiencies. “Understanding of the heart” appears to be associatedwith a more than logical investigation and intellectual comprehension.Spiritual awareness, insight, and inner understanding are perceivedalso to be necessary prerequisites for enabling one to see “what no eyehas ever seen” and to “behold God and the Merkavah.” Before visionsare granted and attained, adepts are expected to expand their percep-tion beyond an ordinary human perspective and to gain a new aware-ness. In this way capable adepts are able to access the divine realm,obtain revelations, and realize their veiled meanings, as human per-ception and divine reality correspond and become one, for a tempo-rary period of time. Relevant to this suggestion is F. J. Streng’sobservation of the nature of mystical awareness:Basic to mystic awareness is the claim that attitudinalpurification is necessary for right perception. What one knowsis closely related to how one knows. To see beyond the ap-parent, or superficial world means a change in the mecha-nism of apprehension.32METHODS AND TECHNIQUESIn all known periods . . . Jewish mystics were in possessionof, and apparently practiced, a wide variety of mystical tech-niques. Some of these bore obvious magical color, whereas"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"30Beholders of Divine Secretsin a few this aspect was overcome; all of them included adeep involvement of the mystic, who was expected to investconsiderable effort in order to attain his religious goal.33Rabbi Nehunia ben Ha-Kanah sat and arranged before themall the matters of the Merkavah: descent and ascent;how one who descends descends,and how one who ascends ascends.34Full spiritual awareness is not instantly granted by God as a gift ofinspiration to the devoted disciples. Nor can it be attained automati-cally by faithful believers. The Hekhalot and Merkavah seekers ac-quire such a spiritual level in a gradual manner. McGinn treats thenature of a progressive process of gaining inner awareness, whichleads to encounters between God and humans:It is important to remember that mysticism is always a pro-cess or a way of life. Although the essential note—or better,goal—of mysticism may be conceived of as a particular kindof encounter between God and human, between the InfiniteSpirit and the finite human spirit, everything that leads upto and prepares for this encounter as well as all that flowsfrom it for the life of the individual in the belief community,is also mystical.35Several Hekhalot and Merkavah accounts include references to aspecific mystical path or “via mystica”which leads adepts to reachtheir objectives. According to J. Dan the stages of this path can belearned and followed.36 A pivotal report in Hekhalot Rabbati illustratesthis process. It depicts Rabbi Nehunia ben Ha-Kanah as a master sit-ting among his disciples in a “mystical assembly” amid torches of fireand light. He reveals to them the nature of the mystical path andexplains both aspects of the spiritual practice—how to reach theMerkavah and how to come back:. . . and he [Rabbi Nehunia ben Ha-Kanah] sat on a benchof pure marble. . . . We all came and sat before him andthere were friends who stood on their feet because theysaw torches of fire and light dividing them and us. . . . RabbiNehunia ben Ha-Kanah sat and arranged before them allthe matters of the Merkavah: descent and ascent; how onewho descends descends, and how one who ascends shouldascend . . .37The“via mystica” involves, among other components, various tech-niques and methods, intended both to induce visions and to influencethe adept’s perception. These include ascetic practices, bodily posture,fasts and special diets,38 rituals of cleansing the body, and repetitions"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Hekhalot and Merkavah Mysticism31of special hymns, prayers, and incantations.39 They include as wellrepeated utterance of divine names and letters,40 active visualizationand meditation techniques,41 and recitation of adjurations and incan-tations.42 The Merkavah seekers are required to adapt such methods ina dynamic process. Thus, from a phenomenological perspectiveHekhalot and Merkavah mysticism corresponds to an non-passivemystical model, which P. Moore classifies:Mystical experience not only comprises static and constantfeatures, in regard to which the mystic remains passive; ithas also a dynamic and developing character, sometimescarrying the subject along with it (as in the case of ecstasyproperly so-called), but often inviting his active responseand co-operation.43Different hypotheses have been suggested in order to explain themental effect of various methods, and the nature of the experiencesdescribed in the Hekhalot and Merkavah accounts. These include ec-static trance, ascents of the soul, deep meditation, dream vision, psy-chological contemplation, hallucination, para-hypnotic states of mind,shamanistic practices, and auto-suggestive dreams.44 As mentionedearlier, it is beyond the scope of this present study to investigate thegenuineness of the experiences and their authentic historical or psy-chological validity. Instead, we shall treat the literary testimony ofthese revelations as our evidence. This testimony appears to describea spiritual-mental process which affects the visionaries’ consciousness,beliefs, and perception.The following examples reflect this observation. In Ma’aseh Merkavah,Rabbi Ishmael, inspired by his teacher Rabbi Nehunia ben Ha-Kanah,recites the necessary names of angels and ascends to the Merkavah.While sitting next to his master on Earth, in his mind he travels inheaven, experiences visions of divine reality, and unfolds them to hismaster.45Hekhalot Zutarti recounts a similar contemplative process, whenspeaking of the divine Name which “was revealed to Rabbi Akiva whenhe was contemplating and beholding the Merkavah; and he descendedand taught it to his students.”46 This narrative suggests that while RabbiAkiva was meditating the Merkavah in the terrestrial world, he at-tained, spiritually, the celestial realm and received the secret Name ofGod.Hekhalot Rabbati relates how Rabbi Ishmael ascends to the chariot,in order to learn information about the ten martyrs, while participatingin a gathering with his companions on Earth.47 The same account de-scribes Rabbi Nehunia ben Ha-Kanah’s inner spiritual journey, depict-ing him among his disciples in the earthly realm, and at the same timegazing at heavenly sights and sharing his visions.48"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"32Beholders of Divine SecretsThere is no doubt, as P. Schäfer, D. J. Halperin, M. M. Swartz, and R.M. Lesses have demonstrated, that some of the methods and practicesreflect strong magical interests and aim at magico-theurgic goals.49 Inaddition to such methods, directed to influence divine powers or to pro-voke safe ascents, yet other methods are designed to alter human percep-tion and in so doing they affect the adepts’ ability to attain the divine.The Babylonian rabbinic leader of the eleventh century, Hai Gaon,first discussed the effects of various preparational practices on the adepts’ability to behold divine visions. According to his understanding:Perhaps you know that many of the sages believed thatwhoever is worthy, [possessing] several [moral] attributeswhich are mentioned and specified, when he wants to seethe Merkavah and glimpse the Hekhalot of the angels onhigh, there are ways of doing so. He is to sit in fasting acertain number of days, and lay his head between his knees,and whisper many songs and praises, which are specified,to the ground. And so you can glimpse inside it and itschambers as one who sees with his eyes the seventh Hekhalotand sees as if he is entering from one Hekhal to another andsees what is in it.50As Halperin shows, Hai Gaon’s observation was based on onepassage in Hekhalot Zutarti which, in fact, is related to the Sar Torahtradition and not to the mystical tradition of the Hekhalot literature.51Nevertheless, Hai Gaon’s general conclusions regarding the mysticalpath seem to be valid, despite his probable reliance on an inappropri-ate passage. “The supernal palaces [Hekhalot] can be gazed at andcontemplated not only by referring to an external event,” asserts M.Idel, “but by concentrating upon one’s own ‘chambers’. The scene ofrevelation is thus no longer supermundane hierarchy of palaces, butthe human consciousness. . . “52 An examination of other passages ofthe Hekhalot and Merkavah literature discloses that the terminologyapplied conveys details regarding the effect of various methods andpractices on the adept’s inner perception. These lead the participantsfrom an ordinary human state of mind into an altered state of mindin which they can obtain divine visions.53 Concepts such as conscious-ness, perception, or inner insight are not explicitly mentioned. Theyare nonetheless recognized in the narratives as the capability to be-hold God, to observe the Merkavah, and to see divine visions, whichis the main objective of the various techniques.For example, Rabbi Ishmael speaks of a technique of praying whichleads to seeing God:Rabbi Ishmael said: Rabbi Nehunia ben Ha-Kanah said to me:“Everyone who prays this prayer in all his power is able to"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Hekhalot and Merkavah Mysticism33look at the splendor of the Shekhinaand the Shekhina is beloved to him.”54Rabbi Ishmael mentions the repetition of names as a technical toolwhich enables the Merkavah seekers to catch sight of the divine:Rabbi Ishmael said: “I asked Rabbi Nehuniaben Ha-Kanah my teacher:When one recited twelve words,how can one look at the splendor of the Shekhina”?55The influence of songs on the ability to attain heavenly visions is alsomade clear:Rabbi Akiva said: “Happy is the manwho stands in all his powerand brings songs before the cherubim of YHWHGod of Israel and who looks at the chariot and sees allthings that they do before the throne of glory.”56Emphasizing the link between technical methods and the mysticalgoal of seeing the divine, the question in the opening of Hekhalot Rabbatiaffirms the effect of reciting songs on the adept’s vision and percep-tion of the Merkavah:What are the songs that one utterswhen he wishes to gaze into the vision of the Merkavah,to descend in peace and to ascend in peace?57A statement in Ma’aseh Merkavah speaks of the method of contemplativemeditation and its effects on the visionaries’ awareness of God’s realm:Rabbi Akiva said: “Who is able to contemplatethe seven palaces and behold the heaven of heavensand see the chambers of chambersand say: ‘I saw the chamber of YH?’”58Rabbi Akiva relates how adepts reflect about the seven palaces of Godand in so doing make them the center of their mental meditation.They are then able, in their visions, to ascend to the celestial spheres,catch sight of the inner, heavenly chambers and experience the pres-ence of the divine.ETHICAL AND SPIRITUAL ALTERATIONAny adequate account of mystical practiceswould have to include the whole programmeof ethical, ascetical, and technical practicestypically followed by mystics.59"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"34Beholders of Divine SecretsWhen I ascended to the first palace, I was righteous;in the second palace, I was pure; in the third palace,I was upright; in the fourth palace, I was perfect;in the fifth palace, I brought holiness before theKing of Kings, blessed be His name.In the sixth palace, I said the sanctification before Him.60Several Hekhalot passages assert that only the most accomplishedindividuals, who can evidently exhibit their traditional religiousknowledge, ethical behavior, and sometimes their distinguished familyand racial lineage, can initiate an ascent to the Merkavah.61 Otherstatements claim that theoretically all Jewish people can follow the“matter of the Merkavah,” and attempt to embark on the heavenlyvoyage.62 According to both patterns success is not promised. Themystical path involves stages of spiritual development, and failure isa definite possibility.Moore, in his assessment of mystical experiences, doctrines andtechniques, has specified the nature of such a gradual process, whichincludes practices of a special kind : “Any adequate account of mys-tical practices would have to include the whole programme of ethical,ascetical, and technical practices typically followed by mystics withinreligious traditions.”63 Several mentions in the Hekhalot and Merkavahliterature clearly reflect a similar attitude. The mystical path involvedan inner process of perfecting oneself and gaining high spiritual andethical virtues such as purity, righteousness, and holiness:I asked of Rabbi Akiva for a prayer that a man prays whenascending to the Merkavah and requested from him thepraise of RWZYH YHWH, God of Israel. Who knows whatit is? And he said to me: “Holiness and purity are in hisheart and he prays a prayer.”64The process of accomplishing ethical and moral integrity is se-quential and gradual. Several accounts reflect “the tendency to set thestages of ascent in parallel with the degree of perfection,” asScholem has observed.65 During their journeys out of this world ad-epts acquire moral qualities, inner strength, and spiritual capacity. Theybecome able to experience divine reality as they proceed toward theseventh divine palace. In his report to Rabbi Ishmael, Rabbi Akivarelates how levels of spiritual wholeness correspond to explicit stagesof the celestial journey:When I ascended to the first palace, I was righteous; in thesecond palace, I was pure; in the third palace, I was truthful;in the fourth palace, I was perfect; in the fifth palace, Ibrought holiness before the King of Kings, blessed be His"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Hekhalot and Merkavah Mysticism35name. In the sixth palace, I said the sanctification before Himwho spoke and fashioned and commanded all living beings,so that the angel would not destroy me. In the seventh pal-ace, I stood in all my power. I trembled in all my limbs.66As the journey unfolds, adepts are challenged with physical andspiritual ordeals. They are required to prove themselves in severalstages, which progressively lead them to the upper seventh palace.67It is significant to note that the ascent does not culminate instantly inan encounter with God, nor does it lead to an immediate acceptanceand participation in the divine realm. It appears that even upon reach-ing the final destination, the travelers are not yet considered “qualified”or “deserving” to take part in the Merkavah realm and to see the Kingin his beauty. A clear reference is made in the literatures to two catego-ries of people: those who are worthy to behold the divine and thosewho have not yet reached this stage.68 This distinction could be relatedto the adept’s spiritual ability to make the transition from an ordinarylevel of awareness to a deeper level of understanding and perception,which enables an attainment of divine truth.In his discussion of the practical aspects of Jewish Kabblisticmysticism, Idel observes an important trend, appearing relevant to theHekhalot and Merkavah mysticism:From its beginning. ecstatic Kabbalah was an elite lore . . .pointing the way that very few may follow for their ownspiritual perfection rather than the means for the restorationof divine harmony.79This observation sheds light on Hekhalot and Merkavah’s demand forthe spiritual perfection, accomplished only by several qualified indi-viduals, who can make the transition from limited awareness to levelsof transcendent perception. It seems that before adepts are grantedpermission to participate in the highest realm, they are obligated todemonstrate their newly acquired spiritual awareness and conscious-ness, described metaphorically as their ability to decipher manifestedvisions with “the eyes of the heart.” The nature of such mystical abil-ity is clarified by Dan:The mystic denies that . . . human faculties are related todivine truth in any way; the more they are developed andfollowed, the farther one is led away from the truth. Theonly avenue to truth is the forsaking of these human facul-ties and the adherence to a completely different quest fortruth, in non-sensual and supralogical means.70The famous “water test” at the entrance to the sixth palace can beseen in this light as a procedure which tests the adepts’ capability to"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"36Beholders of Divine Secretsperceive divine truth, not through the common avenues of knowledgebased on human logic or the senses. Instead, in order to be recognized as“qualified” to enter the seventh palace of God and to behold his presence,adepts are called to approach divine visions in a different fashion.71As recorded in Hekhalot Zutarti and Hekhalot Rabbati, at the en-trance to the sixth palace, a vision of “thousands upon thousands ofwaves of water” is revealed to the travelers. Yet, “there is not a singledrop of water there, only the radiance of the marble stones with whichthe palace is furnished.”82 Unworthy or unqualified individuals aredeceived by their human conception of the vision. They rely on sen-sual observations and logical conclusions, accept the validity of themanifested vision, and thus inquire: “what is the nature of the water?”Deserving mystics, being able to rely on spiritual, nonsensual andsupralogical methods of perception, are capable of beholding the vi-sion and of decoding its meaning. They discern its concealed essenceand therefore see the marble behind the illusion of water. In the contextof Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism, it seems, the vision of the water/marbel is not presented as an allegory but as a transcendent reality whichis suitable to the visionary stage of spiritual and exegetical perception.Eligible adepts are capable of interpreting the vision correctly and thusare qualified to enter the seventh heaven and to see God.Passages in Hekhalot Zutarti delineate the details of this test, whichwas forced upon the four sages who entered the Pardes, Ben Azai, BenZoma, Aher, and Rabbi Akiva. The emphasis appears to be on the actof beholding and on a profound understanding, which allows com-prehension of the concealed depth of apparent revelation:And these are those who entered the Pardes: Ben Azai, andBen Zoma, and the Other, and Rabbi Akiva. Ben Azai peeredinto the sixth palace and saw the brilliance of the air of themarble stones that were paved in the palace. And his bodycould not endure and he opened his mouth and asked them:“These waters, what are their nature?” And he died...BenZoma peered at the brightness of the marble stones andperceived it as water. His body could endure not to askthem, yet his mind could not endure it. And he was harmed.He went out of his mind . . .73Rabbi Akiva said: “Ben Azai gained and stood at the gate ofthe sixth palace. And he saw the brilliance of the air of thepure marble stones. And he opened his mouth twice andsaid: ‘Water, Water’. In a wind of an eye they cut his headoff and threw upon him eleven thousand iron cutters.” Thissign will be for generations, that a person should not err atthe gate of the sixth palace.74"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Hekhalot and Merkavah Mysticism37The account describes the sages who were expected to unravel thedisclosed sight. Of the four, only Rabbi Akiva was able to see themarble stones behind the misleading facade of waves of water. Thus,only he was considered by God to be “worthy of beholding my glory.”75SPIRITUAL TRANSFORMATIONSThe shift from conventional to mystical awareness . . .expresses a new attitude or temperament which is morethan, but inclusive of, intellect or ideas. The nature of thetotal awareness can be defined in terms of its comprehen-siveness and its total purity.76I saw a light in my heart like the days of heaven . . . sinceI stood on my feet and saw my face shining from my wis-dom, I began to explain each and every angel in each andevery palace.77The climax of the journey is a stage of inner transformation. Thistransformation enables qualified adepts to transcend their ordinaryhuman perspective and to obtain an elevated awareness and spiritualperception. Thus, they are able to observe the true meaning of veileddivine visions and achieve their mystical goals at the end of theirecstatic ascent.78Several Hekhalot and Merkavah accounts present this stage as athreefold pattern of self-transformation, using a familiar pattern ofdeath and rebirth.79This pattern has very much in common, it seems,with a pattern of initiatory rite of passage which is typically discussedin the contexts of both myths and rituals. A. van Gennep, followed byC. Bell, speaks of the rite of passage as one type of ritual which in-cludes three stages: a stage of separation, followed by a transitionalstate (termed liminal), and concluded by a reincorporation into a so-cial group with a different status.80 This rite, often displayed in pat-terns of symbolic death and rebirth, “enables the individual to passfrom one defined position to another, which is equally well defined.”81As a result, the process leads to “a new way of seeing and acting.”82In Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism, the social objective is not promi-nent. Instead, a process of symbolic death and rebirth, which seemsanalogous in structure to the tripartite pattern described by van Gennep,leads the visionaries to cross conceptual boundaries between the ter-restrial and the celestial realms.In the first stage, often illustrated metaphorically by images of aritual death, the Hekhalot adepts collapse, faint or fall down as theylet go of their human disposition. In the second stage, illustrated byimages of rebirth, awakening, or illumination, adepts surpass their"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"38Beholders of Divine Secretsprevious ordinary human perception. They are granted a new andwider awareness, and reach an exceptional spiritual understand-ing. A heavenly ceremony sometimes follows this stage, granting itan official and formal seal. In the third stage, the visionaries gaina god-like insight and a new status. They are no longer limited bytheir human, logical, or sensual perception. Instead, their ability“to see” is unrestricted. They rely on their spiritual potential andcan therefore see and comprehend divine visions with their own“understanding of the heart.” The following discussion will exam-ine the significance of the transformation process and the way itleads the Merkavah seekers to accomplish their mystical goal andto behold divine revelations and visions. Several Hekhalot andMerkavah literary traditions, especially 3 Enoch,Hekhalot Rabbati,Hekhalot Zutarti, Ma’aseh Merkavah, and Shi’ur Komah, demonstratethis aspect.Rabbi Ishmael, in the beginning of 3 Enoch, recounts his ecstaticexperience. Having passed from palace to palace, attempting to gainsight of the celestial realm, he stands finally at the gates of the seventhpalace, receives permission to enter, and is immediately overwhelmedby God’s closeness. Before he sees visions of the chariot, he falls downand faints, only to be revived and restored by Metatron, “the heavenlyPrince of the Divine Presence.”83 God then enlightens Rabbi Ishmael’seyes and heart so that he will be capable of participating in the newheavenly reality:Then I entered the seventh palace and he led me to the campof the Shekhinah and presented me before the throne of gloryso I might behold the chariot. But as soon as the princes ofthe chariot looked at me and the fiery seraphim fixed theirgaze on me, I shrank back trembling and fell down . . . untilthe Holy One, blessed be he, rebuked them . . . At onceMetatron, Prince of the Divine Presence, came and revivedme and raised me to my feet, but still I did not have strengthenough to sing a hymn before the glorious throne of the glo-rious King.. . . But after an hour the Holy One, blessed be he,opened to me the gates of the Chariot . . . He enlightened myeyes and my heart to utter psalms, praise, jubilation, thanks-giving, song, glory, majesty, laud and strength.84Following the stage of inner transformation, Rabbi Ishmael is ledon a tour through the celestial realm by the angel Metatron. The angeluncovers to him divine sights, which he is now able to behold. Metatronconstantly uses the same sentence before itemizing the concealed di-vine mysteries: “Come and I will show you.”85 Consequently he intro-duces abstract visions which are normally beyond recognition,"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Hekhalot and Merkavah Mysticism39emphasizing Rabbi Ishmael’s new mystical ability to see amorphousvisions such as the souls of the righteous, the spirits of the stars, the“hand of God which no creature can see.”86 Among the spectacles hesees are the following:. . . letters by which the heaven and earth were created . . .fire burns in the midst of hail . . .lightning flashes in the midst of mountains of snow . . .thunder rumbles in the highest heights . . .the souls of the righteous who have already been createdand have returned, and the souls of the righteouswho have not yet been created . . . the spirits of the starswhich stands in the “Raqia”. . . the souls of the angelsand the spirits of the ministers . . .the right hand of the Omnipresent One . . .that even the seraphim and the ophanimare not allowed to look on.”87When observing these wonders, Rabbi Ishmael is an active partici-pant. He observes directly, acknowledging his own new proficiency tobehold astonishing and extraordinary, intangible sights:I saw fire, snow and hailstones enclosed one within the other,without one destroying the other . . .I saw lightning flashing in the midst of mountains of snow,without being quenched . . .I saw thunders and voices roaringin the midst of flames of fire . . .I saw rivers of fire in the midst of rivers of water,and rivers of water in the midst of river of fire . . .88Metatron goes on to display before Rabbi Ishmael the secret heavenlycurtain (pargod, ), on which all the deeds and thoughts of all thegenerations of the world are recorded, past and future:89Metatron said to me: Come and I will show youthe curtain of the Omnipresent One,which is spread before the Holy One, blessed be He,and on which are printed all the generationsof the world, and all their deedswhether done or to be done, till the last generation...and I saw each generation and its potentates. . . .Adam and his generation, their deeds and their thoughts;I saw Noah and his generation of the Flood,their deeds and their thoughts;Nimrod. . .

Hesees and understands the manifest deeds and unseen thoughts of allthe generations of the world from Adam to the Messiah:. . . and I saw the Messiah, the son of Joseph,and his generation and all they will do . . .the Messiah, the son of David, and his generationand all the battles and wars and all they will do to Israelwhether for good or bad.92The triple pattern of transformation is clearly present in the abovedescription, emphasizing the link between the mental-spiritual aware-ness of the adepts and their potential of seeing divine visions. RabbiIshmael faints and surrenders his human consciousness in a stage thatcan be understood as symbolic death. A stage of rebirth follows. RabbiIshmael is revived, elevated to a higher spiritual level by the heavenlyprince Metatron, and enlightened by God himself. He gains a specialspiritual perspective and an “understanding of the eyes and the heart.”Following a transition to an even higher level, Rabbi Ishmael is initiatedinto the divine realm. He then partakes in the heavenly liturgy, praisesGod with the angels, and sings hymns before the glorious throne. He iscapable of exceeding the limits of human perception and thus beholdselusive and inconceivable visions, normally beyond mortal eyes. Withthis new “understanding of the heart,” Rabbi Ishmael can look at meta-physical, abstract sights in the divine realm. He sees the amorphousspirits of the stars, or the souls of angels. He watches the formlessthunders and the voices roaring, and gazes at miraculous sights of fire,snow, and hailstones enclosed one within the other. From this divine-like viewpoint, Rabbi Ishmael transcends time and place as he observesevents and mighty individuals in the far off past or the distant future.Hekhalot Rabbati presents a similar process. Rabbi Ishmael is askedby Rabbi Nehunia ben Ha-Kanah to ascend into the Merkavah andthere to find out in heaven the destiny of the ten martyr-sages. Hegoes up and is devastated to discover the future calamities awaitingthe Jewish people. He is then comforted by the heavenly guardianHadari’el, who exposes various heavenly eschatological secrets beforehim and permits him to experience the divine realm. This event ispreceded by a stage of transformation, which clearly refers to the samepattern discussed above:"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Hekhalot and Merkavah Mysticism41. . . when I heard this loud voice I trembled and I was silentand I fell back until Hadari’el the prince came and bestowedupon me a spirit and soul; and raised me on my feet . . . andhe led me into the archives of comfort, archives of salvation,and I saw groups of serving angels sitting and weavinggarments of salvation and making crowns of life for therighteous persons . . . He sat me down in his lap and askedme: “what do you see?” I told him: “I see seven bolts oflightning running as one.”93After Rabbi Ishmael undergoes a stage of separation from his commonhuman disposition, he is given spirit and soul, reincorporated into anew state, and thus becomes capable of seeing concealed visions be-yond phenomenological reality:...I heard the sound of great noise coming from Eden . . .and there was David, king of Israel, leading, andI saw all the kings of the house of David following . . .David stood and uttered songs and praiseswhich no ear has ever heard before.94The model of self-transformation is likewise evident in this report.Initially Rabbi Ishmael loses his consciousness. He is then revived byan angelic figure who elevates him and grants him a new life. After histransformation Rabbi Ishmael, unrestricted by human capacities, gainsan independent divine-like outlook. He sees the interior of celestialarchives, exhibited before him, and witnesses heavenly sights. He isevidently qualified to participate in the divine reality which does notconform to conventional laws of chronological time and historical place.Rabbi Ishmael hears voices from Eden, sees King David accompaniedby the kings of Israel and listens to them praising God in extraordi-nary acclamations that no one has heard before.From a phenomenological perspective, it is significant to note thatall parallel Hekhalot and Merkavah accounts of the transformationprocess acknowledge both the physical aspects of the experience—described in images such as trembling, fainting, falling down, stand-ing—and its mental, spiritual components—often depicted as the abilityof beholding divine visions. It seems, thus, that in this tradition themystical experience is seen as total and integral, involving the physi-cal body, sensation, emotion, and perception. Moore’s observationasserts this aspect of the mystical phenomenon, which he discerns as:not only “mental” phenomena or “disembodied” states ofmind, but as involving tactile, substantial and corporealdimensions also . . . mystical doctrines and theories includea good deal about subtle bodies, psychic organs, and higherforms of existence interpreting (though sometimes reactingwith) the ordinary world of things and persons.95"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"42Beholders of Divine SecretsA third narrative in Hekhalot Rabbati gives formal details of thisintegrated transformational process. In this account, the information isprovided as an objective, general report, directed at all determinedadepts, not as a personal testament of a single visionary:. . . and whenever one wishes to descend to the Merkavah,Anafi’el, the prince, opens the doors of the gate of the sev-enth palace for him. This man enters and stands at the thresh-old of the gate to the seventh palace. The holy living creaturesraise to him five hundred and twelve eyes . . . and that manthen trembles, shakes, and shudders. He is stricken and faintsand he falls backwards. And the prince Anafi’el supportshim, and sixty-three other gatekeepers of the seventh pal-aces. They support him and say: “fear not, son of the be-loved seed, enter and behold the King in his beauty and youwill not be destroyed and you will not be burned.” . . . Theygive him strength and immediately a horn is sounded abovethe firmament over their heads and the holy living creaturescover their faces and the Cherubim and Ophanim turn theirfaces around. And he enters and stands before the throne ofHis glory. . . . As soon as he stands before the throne of glory,he opens and says songs that the throne of glory chantsevery day.96This presentation relates a paradigmatic tripartite model of symbolicdeath and rebirth for everyone who requests to descend to the Merkavah.In the first stage, adepts faint and fall back. They are then revived by theangel Anafi’el and other divine beings (corresponding to the figures ofMetatron and Hadari’el of the previous narratives), who assist them andgrant them new strength. A blast of the heavenly horn proclaims thisphase officially. Consequently, they enter divine chambers, stand beforeGod, and join the throne of glory in the celestial rituals.Once again, it is possible to note a repetitive version of this pat-tern in Ma’aseh Merkavah. Rabbi Ishmael, inspired by his teacher, RabbiNehunia ben Ha-Kanah, learns from him details concerning the meth-ods of ascent by uttering names:Rabbi Ishmael said: “Since I heard from Rabbi Nehunia benHa-Kanah my teacher this report...I stood on my feet andasked him all the names of the princes of wisdom, and fromthe question that I asked I saw a light in my heart like thedays of heaven . . . since I stood on my feet and saw my faceshining from my wisdom . . . I began to explain every angelin each and every palace.”97In this passage, the first stage of the transformation is not mentioneddirectly. It can, nonetheless, be inferred from statements relating the"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Hekhalot and Merkavah Mysticism43second stage, in which Rabbi Ishmael stands up and is fused withlight. This report leads to the assumption that he was not standing,but was perhaps in a state of unconsciousness before he was granteddivine wisdom and enlightened understanding. As soon as RabbiIshmael gains “light in his heart,” he himself is able to recognize andto distinguish every angel in each of the heavenly palaces. He compre-hends the vision and describes the “details of the heavenly realm.”This elevated stage is recognized by his teacher, Rabbi Nehunia benHa-Kanah, who questions his disciple, expressing astonishment at hisindependent, extraordinary ability.98Enoch’s elevation from a terrestrial being into the supreme celes-tial angel Metatron is recorded in 3 Enoch in a similar manner, but ona cosmic scale:99Before the Holy One, blessed be he, set me to serve thethrone of glory, he opened for me 300,000 gates of under-standing, 300,000 gates of prudence, 300,000 gates of life,300,000 gates of grace and favor, 300,000 gates of love, 300,000gates of Torah, 300,000 gates of sustenance, 300,000 gates ofmercy . . .100I was enlarged and increased in size until I matched theworld in height and breadth. He made to grow on me 72wings, 36 on one side and 36 on the other . . . He fixed in me365,000 eyes. . . . There was no sort of splendor, brilliance,brightness, or beauty in the luminaries of the world that hefailed to fix in me.101During the metamorphosis, which occurs on a physical, mental, andspiritual level, Enoch sheds his human form and becomes a divinefigure. The transition from one level of existence to another is fol-lowed by a stage of enlightenment, during which Enoch is granteddivine wisdom and gains an exceptional spiritual and mental under-standing. He then crosses the boundaries between the finite and infiniterealms in a non-temporary way. He sees and decodes veiled levels ofreality and obtains unseen visions and enigmatic secrets. Like theCreator, he himself looks and beholds the mysteries of divine wisdom,the order of nature, the depth of the Torah, and the hidden thoughtsof the human heart:The Holy One, blessed be he, revealed to me from that timeonward all the mysteries of wisdom, all the depths of theperfect Torah and all the thoughts of human hearts. Allmysteries of the world and all the orders of nature standrevealed before me as they stand revealed before the Creator."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"44Beholders of Divine SecretsFrom that time onward I looked and beheld deep secretsand wonderful mysteries. Before anyone thinks in secret, Isee his thought; before he acts I see his act. There is noth-ing in heaven above or deep within the earth concealedfrom me.102In Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism, we have seen that the pro-cess of transformation leads the mystic to experience a change in con-sciousness, gain an enlightened perspective, and understand theinnermost truths of revealed visions. Rabbi Akiva, Rabbi Ishmael, andEnoch reach this stage, as well as other members of the “descendersto the Merkavah” circle. Though most accounts do not specify explic-itly the nature of such a state, descriptions of the divine-like percep-tion, which accomplished mystics gain, demonstrates its quality.Hekhalot Rabbati proclaims this state in the well-known gedulla pas-sage, which seems to emphasize the independent ability of mystics tobehold and see all, like God himself:The greatest thing of all is the fact that he sees and recog-nizes all the deeds of human beings, even in the chamber ofchambers, whether they are fine or corrupt deeds . . .The greatest thing of all is the fact that all creatures will bebefore him like silver before the silversmith, who perceiveswhich silver is refined, which silver is unfit, and whichsilver is pure.103PARALLEL PATTERNS OF SPIRITUAL TRANSFORMATIONIn the history of religion the objective representation is typi-cally in the form of myth, and it generally precedes themystical stage, which may appear as an internalized versionof the same motif.104The previous section examined the process of transformation in Hekhalotand Merkavah mysticism. This tradition, as we have seen, incorporatesa common mythological-ritualistic pattern of transformational death andrebirth, in a spiritual manner, in order to convey an inner shift of per-ception, consciousness, and awareness. It is relevant, in this context, toconsider H. Jonas’ seminal analysis of mystical movements of late an-tiquity, which seems to disclose what appears to be an apparent parallelnotion.105 Although the scope of this analysis does not allow a full treat-ment of this topic, several observations are worth noting.Exploring the development of early Western mysticism, Jonas hassuggested that several traditions employ in their mystical teaching"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Hekhalot and Merkavah Mysticism45mythological-ritualistic structures, in an interiorized and spiritualizedmanner. Myth, according to Jonas, is the objective representation ofthe “way of being in the world” and is usually prior in time to mys-tical realizations, “which may appear as an internalized version of thesame motif.”106 Examining one basic notion of ancient religion, theascent and descent of the soul, Jonas has followed the alterations ofthis theme, originating in mythology, into mystical systems, in par-ticular the late pagan mystery cults, Gnostic mysticism, and eventu-ally the mystical philosophies found in the teachings of Origen andPlotinus. These mystical traditions, demonstrate the “transposition ofa mythological scheme into the inwardness of a person, with the trans-lation of its objective stages into subjective phases of self-performableexperience.”107 In Jonas’ view, the late mystery cults play an importantmediating role in this transformation of perspective, since their ritual-istic performance of the death and rebirth myth, introduces the basiccategories and images later used in mystical thoughts.This observation becomes clear upon examination of several as-pects related to the mystery cults of the Graeco-Roman world.108 Themysteries were widely influential from the first century C.E., and reacheda peak of popularity in the second century onward, when they fellunder the influence of late Greek religious thought and were trans-formed from imported cults into universal mystery cults.109 Despitethe diverse origin and the different cultic myths and views of indi-vidual mysteries, certain collective features or even a unified theologi-cal framework, common to most mysteries, especially in the late period,have been discerned.110 Moreover, despite the vow of secrecy by whichparticipants were initiated into the cults, some information about themysteries’ traditions, goals, rites, and beliefs did filter through to thegeneral public.111 As scholars have shown, in addition to esoteric teach-ings restricted to inner groups, the mystery cults had a public facadeand some of their views were apparently meant to be known by thegeneral community.112Several external characteristics of mystery cults have been noted:organization of the members into communities, certain ethical or as-cetic obligations, mutual support, the obligation of obedience to theleader of the cult, and the preservation of specific traditions guardedin secrecy.113 In addition to these external similarities, various cultsshared a common set of beliefs and doctrines. Initiation into the greatmysteries of the gods, introduced through a prevalent process of sym-bolic death and rebirth, was one of these shared and widespreaddoctrines.114 This procedure enabled initiated adepts to enter into themysteries of various gods, to become like them and be involved intheir fate, and to be filled with their divine power. The terminology of"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"46Beholders of Divine Secrets“rebirth”(palingenesia)“reformation,” “transfiguration,” was coined inthe context of these rituals. “Purification” and “seeing”(epopteia) wereofficial steps of these initiation rites in antiquity.One passage quoted by Stobaeus and attributed by him to Plutarch,is often cited to demonstrate several significant aspects of the deathand rebirth process. According to this account, the stage of rebirth ispreceded by an hazardous journey in which the seekers wander infear, face dangers, tremble, and shudder, before they experience anillumination and enter a new, higher stage of divine existence:At first there is wandering, and wearisome roaming, andfearful traveling through darkness with no end to be found.Then, just before the consummation, there is every sort ofterror, shuddering and trembling and perspiring and beingalarmed. But after this, a marvelous light appears, and openplaces and meadows await, with voices and dancing andthe solemnities of sacred utterances and holy visions. Inthat place one walks about at will, now perfect and fullyinitiated.115In Jonas’ view, the emphasis on the death and rebirth model, re-lated in this account among other sources, was not so much on ritu-alistic external aspects, but more on internalized spiritual experience.116In the late mystery cults traditional ascetic or cathartic preparations,which the devotees underwent, became an autonomous system of self-transformation. In Jonas’ words, “sanctifications and ascetic prepara-tions of all kinds exchange their ritualistic for a more directly personalfunction in the life of the self.”117 Jonas has directed attention to theproximity of the term teleisthai (to be initiated and perfected) to the verbteleutan (dying), and emphasized the inner significance of the symbolicdeath and rebirth experience which led devotees to be transformed,initiated into the mysteries, and be united with the gods.118 The expe-rience of ecstasy, thus, was associated not only with a formal conceptof cultic union with the gods, but also with an interiorized version ofthe process, associated with the individual’s inner spiritual achieve-ments: “Ecstasy, instead of merely certifying that apotheosis has takenplace, can, in its own right and experimental quality, be taken to rep-resent perfection itself.”119As Jonas has contended, the spiritualized interpretation of themythical- ritualistic theme of death and rebirth, found in late mysterycults, created the basic categories for later mystical tradition found inGnostic and early Christian sources. Clearly there are many differ-ences between these traditions and the mysticism of the Hekhalot andMerkavah. Jonas’ observations are relevant, however, since they eluci-"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Hekhalot and Merkavah Mysticism47date an important shared phenomenon, namely, the tendency to applya ritualistic theme of symbolic death and rebirth, in a spiritualized,internalized fashion, in order to depict an inner change of perceptionand awareness which enable adepts to be conscious of the divine.EXEGESIS OF DIVINE VISIONSA recognition of the interdependence of experience and in-terpretation can help avoid some of the false problems evi-dent in scholarship of mysticism.The emphasis on mysticalexperience has led not only to the neglect of mystical herme-neutics, but also to an emphasis on first person, autobio-graphical accounts of specific visionary or unitive experiencesof God.120He is, so to say, like us . . . and this is His glorywhich is concealed from us.121As we have seen, several Hekhalot and Merkavah accounts presenta dialectic approach to the prospect of seeing divine visions. Behold-ing God and the Merkavah is at once the ultimate mystical goal,desired by God and human beings, but also a practice which isstrongly denounced and prohibited. Moreover, God, the object of theadept’s vision, is depicted as both accessible and, at the same time,as totally imperceptible.These contradictions may be reconciled by the notion of the en-hanced perception and vision gained by mystics. Revelations of divinereality, it seems, are dependent upon the visionaries’ subjective stateof spiritual perception. Following a change of consciousness, the de-scenders to the Merkavah experience the effect of the inner transfor-mation on a cognitive-spiritual level. They acquire additional innerunderstanding and a greater capacity of comprehending visions. Thisenlightened mode enables qualified mystics to behold visions of thedivine, which are normally concealed from all eyes. They understandmasked truths and interpret revelations correctly.Thus, it appears that Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism ascribesa great significance to hermeneutical insights and exegetical percep-tion which are mystical in essence. The ones who seek visions of theKing and his chariot can actually gaze at these manifested visionswhen they are capable of interpreting their authentic meaning. Theyare then able to respond to God’s request, to see “what no eye has everseen,”122 to penetrate divine mysteries, to decode revelations, and thusto reach deep theosophical truths. In this way, the exegetical processbecomes an integral part of the mystical encounter with God."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"48Beholders of Divine SecretsThis practice of “mystical exegesis,” however, is unique in Hekhalotand Merkavah mysticism. As M. Fishbane, J. J. Collins, and othershave discerned, the primary method of decoding visions and revela-tions, in both biblical-prophetic literature and apocalyptic sources, isthrough a divine revealed inspiration or through an angelic interpre-tation.123 Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism, in contrast, seems toemphasize, primarily, a humanly attained mystical perception. Divinerevelations and visions are not elucidated by an angelic messenger orby divine inspiration. Instead, they are deciphered by human descend-ers to the chariots who complete their journey, gain “an understand-ing of the heart,” transcend limited human apprehension, and acquirean enlightened perspective. Then, for a short time, their human per-ception and divine reality correspond.In several accounts, this notion surfaces, as we have seen. Anexample from Hekhalot Zutarti denotes clearly both the paradoxicalconcept of the divine, and the distinctive mystical awareness to per-ceive it. It opens with a theoretical question regarding human abilityto behold visions of God:Who is able to explain, who is able to see?First, it is written (Exodus 33:20):For no one shall see me and live.And secondly, it is written (Deuteronomy 5:21–24):that God speaks with a human and he lives.And thirdly it is written (Isaiah 6:1):I saw YHWH seated on a throne.124Different contradictory views are offered further in the passage, butnone of them appears to be adequate. The account then ends withRabbi Akiva’s explanation, which sheds light on the complexity ofseeing the divine, and seems to be acceptable and most suitable:He is, so to say, like usand He is greater than alland this is His glorywhich is concealed from us.125RabbiAkiva recognizes God’s transcendent supremacy: “He isgreater than everything.” He also perceives God’s manifested quali-ties in an anthropomorphic figurative way: “He is, so to say, as weare.” At the same time, Rabbi Akiva acknowledges the hidden es-sence of the vision, normally lying beyond human observation: “Hisglory consists in this that he is concealed from us.” We see thenthat for an adept such as Rabbi Akiva, who has reached the abilityto “behold” and “gaze” from a mystical perspective, the two as-"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Hekhalot and Merkavah Mysticism49pects of God, the visible and the abstract, or the concrete and tran-scendent, are acknowledged as one. Through exegesis of ambigu-ous figurative and concrete visions, Rabbi Akiva reveals thetranscendent supremacy of God.An additional manifestation of this exegetical enlightened perspec-tive is present in a Shi’ur Komah passage, in which Rabbi Akiva de-codes God’s image as it was revealed to him in a vision:126The countenance of His face is like the image of a spirit,like the form of a soul that no creature can recognize.His body is like chrysolite, filling the entire world.Neither the near nor the far can look at Him.127This observation is highly significant. Rabbi Akiva beholds God’smanifested, figurative image. He perceives corporeal attributes suchas body, form, limbs, and the other specific features. At the same timehe also sees beyond the visible surface, and recognizes God’s spiritualqualities and transcendent nature, presented metaphorically as of souland spirit. Rabbi Akiva, a worthy mystic, goes far in his exegesis ofdivine visions. He beholds and deciphers their hidden meaning andthus reaches a profound divine truth.CONCLUSIONWith this example of Rabbi Akiva we conclude this chapter. As wehave seen the case of Rabbi Akiva is not isolated. It exhibits a charac-teristic outlook of Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism, found in corre-sponding accounts, and investigates the links between inner spiritualtransformation on the one hand and divine revelations and spiritualexegesis on the other hand. According to the Hekhalot and Merkavahmystical tradition, therefore, we can discern that human beings candevelop an immediate consciousness of the unperceived God andbehold veiled meaning of divine visions.This ability is dependent ultimately upon single individuals andtheir spiritual accomplishments, gained gradually through following aprescribed mystical path of self-discipline. Alternation of a commonsensual and logical human perception, attainment of spiritual percep-tion, and proper comprehension are some elements introduced in thesetraditions as leading to an inner transformation. The transformation inturn enables the Merkavah seekers to gain a transcendent awarenessof divine reality. The option of seeing visions of the divine, impossiblefor most human beings, is thus achieved temporarily by a small num-ber of visionaries who can perceive, decode, and interpret them.

Green, Keter, ix.INTRODUCTIONAs many studies of mysticism have observed, mystical phenomenaare often distinct from concrete situations of everyday life. Moreover,they frequently evolve outside the conventional realms of normativereligions. Thus, by their very nature, specific mystical notions ofvarious traditions often stand beyond common verbal expression andfamiliar vocabulary. Nonetheless, even mystical notions which arenot clearly conveyed by conventional language still find expression.P. Moore makes the following observation:Even those aspects or stages of mystical experience acknowl-edged as difficult or impossible to describe, are not neces-sarily beyond all possibility of communication. For if mysticsare using language at all responsibly, then even what theysay about the indescribable types or aspects of experiencemay at least serve to define them . . .1A variety of vocabularies and verbal discourses are exercised bydifferent mystical schools in order to mold and to transmit their teach-ings.

Frequently it breaks linguistic conventions, and employsphilosophical terms and metaphors in a complex fashion. Each tradi-tion develops a common vocabulary, imagery, and style according toits unique nature, as S. T. Katz discerns:Mystical literature comes in many forms, and the modalitychosen as the means of communication in any instance isnot incidental or tangential to its content.2What kind of verbal discourse and patterns of expression articu-late the essence of mystical teachings, revelations, experiences andspiritual interpretations found in the Hekhalot and Merkavah litera-ture? One notable feature of this tradition is the manner in which itintroduces many of its mystical notions through presentations rangingfrom the extremely intangible to the concrete and particular. As wehave seen, in a large number of descriptions the spiritual dimensionsof an inner voyage and its metaphysical goals are stated. The literaturepresents a mental contemplative or ecstatic path of crossing conceptual-spiritual boundaries, which leads to an awareness of transcendenttruths. It is most significant to note that this process and its obtainedgoals are externalized. Various accounts describe it, in concrete andtangible images, as a dangerous corporeal journey out of this world,which leads the Merkavah-seekers to a tactile heavenly sphere in whichGod resides in his palaces and reigns from his celestial throne.Such presentation, I suggest, reveals the distinctive manner inwhich Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism conceptualizes and conveysmany of its mystical notions, by evoking a variety of mythologicalthemes and patterns. A clarification is needed when we refer to “my-thology” in relation of Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism. What ex-actly is meant when we use this term? In this mystical school we findseveral mythological frameworks through which mystical teachings,experiences, visions and revelations are expressed and formalized. Wefind mystical notions presented through the applications of patternssuch as figurative language, pictorial images, and visual metaphors,which appear to be mythological in nature. We also encounter echoesfrom particular mythological traditions, rooted in ancient Near Easternsources, including primarily biblical and Mesopotamian imagery andthemes. These, however, not only resurface, but are also reformulatedand reinterpreted to assume additional characteristics in the new mys-tical context of the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature. In many ways, itis possible to assert that the language of mythology plays a major gen-erative and expressive role in Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism.Chapters 4 and 5 will demonstrate this observation by presentinga concise phenomenological and literary examination of the manner in"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Mythical Language of Hekhalot and Merkavah Mysticism53which Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism integrates diverse mytho-logical patterns. This chapter, as an introduction, will establish thebasic methodological groundwork for the perspective on mythologyand its application in Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism taken in thisstudy. It will treat the following: the nature of mythological thoughtand expression in general, features of biblical mythology, and aspectsof Mesopotamian mythology as well as its lasting presence and influ-ence in late antiquity.MYTHOLOGICAL PATTERNS AND TRADITIONSMYTHOLOGICAL PATTERNS OF THOUGHT AND EXPRESSIONTheories of myth vary greatly. Focusing on distinct fields of study, as wellas on diverse methodologies, scholars have interpreted myth differently.Since an exploration of the multiple meanings of myth is beyond thescope of our inquiry, the following discussion avoids plunging into thevast sea of myth-definition and classification. Rather, it introduces se-lected observations, reflecting varied academic perspectives, intended toshed light on specific features of mythological patterns of thought andexpression. These features seem to be present in certain Hekhalot andMerkavah mystical narrations, as will be demonstrated further.Contemporary studies of myth, originating in varying disciplines,have moved away from a narrow understanding of myth which asso-ciates the genre with archaic, polytheistic modes of thought. Despiteobvious differences between theories, departing from perspectives suchas anthropology, linguistics, folklore, psychology, religious studies andsociology, it is possible to affirm that they all share the view that mythreflects a distinct mode of thought, comprehension, and expression. S.Ackerman advances this observation: “Historians of religion, whileoften deferring on how to interpret any specific myth, tend to agreethat all myths, through the use of symbolic language, communicatetranscendent meaning within a culture . . .”3Myths reveal spiritual truths, ethical concepts, collective dreams,and the traditional beliefs of a specific group or community. They areoften distinguished by particular modes of expression which includeprose narrative style, dramatic action, pictorial imagery, and the use offigurative language. Through the narration of stories, the incorpora-tion of visual images, personified metaphors, concrete examples, tan-gible illustrations and dramatic plots, myths transmit the significantconcepts, views and values of the tradition from which they emerge.Such notion of mythical language, asserted by H. Frankfort and H. A.Frankfort, is still valid:"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"54Beholders of Divine SecretsThe imagery of myth is therefore by no means allegory. Itis nothing less than a careful chosen cloak for abstractthought. It represents the form in which the experiencebecome conscious.4W. Doniger’s observations also shed light on the nature of the mytho-logical expression:The major part of the impact of any myth lies not in itsargument or logos (true or false) but in its imagery, itsmetaphors. The power of a myth is as much visual as ver-bal. The myth confines the function of philosophy . . . withthe symbolism of ritual or cosmology....Myths are bothevents and images, both verbs and nouns.5In a similar vein W. Burkert asserts the power of myth to stateprofound conceptual notions using specific modes of expression. Inmyth, according to Burkert “significant human situations are unitedwith fantastic combinations to form a polyvalent semiotic system whichis used in multifarious ways to illuminate reality.”6BIBLICAL MYTHOLOGY AND HEKHALOT AND MERKAVAH MYSTICISMA consensus that the Hebrew bible reflects a primary break with theworld of mythology has often been claimed in diverse earlier worksof biblical scholarship. Based on a narrow conception of myth, as anexpression of a polytheistic viewpoint, the biblical monotheistic ac-counts were set apart repeatedly as non-mythological, historical docu-ments.7 In the last few decades, however, scholars have acknowledgedthe presence of myths within the monotheistic context of the bible,and the prevailing view that ‘there are no myths in the Bible’ hasbeen disputed. Since a thorough survey of this scholarly develop-ment would be too vast in this context, the following observationsrepresent this perspective.8G. H. Davies, for instance, contends: “Mythology is a way ofthinking and of imagining about the divine rather than thinking andimagining about the gods. . . myth is a way of thinking, indepen-dent of a polytheistic setting.”9Studying the origins of biblical mono-theism, M. S. Smith questions several earlier scholarly definitions ofmyth, classified by him as narrow and formal, and concludes: “Aminimum view may begin, therefore, with the circumscribed defini-tion of myth as narratives about divine beings, but without excludingnarratives with only one deity such as Yahweh.” Investigating thepervasive mythological elements in the Hebrew bible and attemptingto explain why such a prominent material has been disregarded, N.Wyatt speculates: “Attempts to emancipate the bible from myth arise"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Mythical Language of Hekhalot and Merkavah Mysticism55from the inevitability of eisegesis within a committed readership, andthe mistaken view that myth has nothing to teach us and somehowmisrepresents the message.”10In the context of Jewish studies, F. Rozenzweig and M. Buber haveexamined the notion of monotheistic myth.11 Judaism as a living reli-gion, they assert, has a conception of myth which does not contradictthe monotheistic idea of God. It is in a similar spirit that other scholarshave confirmed the existence of myth in biblical and post-biblical Jew-ish literature. A. Green points out the key place of the Hebrew Bibleas a source for ancient mythology:As we move beyond the one time scholarly assumption thatthe Bible knew myth only to refute it, or as we come tosoften the overly sharp distinctions scholars once madebetween sacred myth and sacred history, we come to under-stand that Hebrew Scripture itself is among the most impor-tant sources for the recovery of this ancient human legacy.12In a similar vein, Y. Liebes, in a study on the ongoing evolution ofmyths from biblical to Jewish mystical literature, affirms:Myths are shared by all religions, but are also the source ofeach religion’s uniqueness, as they are concerned with theparticular and concrete rather than with generalization. . . .Each religion has its own myth into which it absorbs andincorporates influences from other religions, and this is alsotrue for the Jewish religion. Even Judaism’s monotheisticessence is not contradictory to myth, and monotheism itselfhas its own far-reaching myth.13No doubt, a number of different traditions played a part in theformation of the Hekhalot and Merkavah mystical discourse. Amongthese, material contained in the Hebrew bible, including its mytho-logical lore and conceptions, has a great potential as a significant sourceof inspiration. Statements in the Hekhalot and Merkavah literatureattest that the biblical corpus was regarded as pivotal in the circle ofthe chariot seekers and its members were obligated to master it, aspart of their preliminary, preparatory education. As has been assertedearlier, only the one “who has read the Torah, Prophets, and Writ-ings,” among other Jewish traditional teachings, was distinguished asqualified to ascend to the chariot. It is possible, therefore, to considerthe Hebrew bible and several of its varied mythological traditions asa possible source which may have given rise to or shaped severalmystical narrations of Hekhalot and Merkavah literature. This is notto claim that the Hekhalot and Merkavah authors and compilersadopted all facets of the incorporated biblical mythological themes,"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"56Beholders of Divine Secretsstories, and imagery. Nonetheless, old mythical material from severalbiblical texts seem to have been elicited, and altered eventually, inorder to embody and to articulate certain, novel Hekhalot andMerkavah mystical notions.MESOPOTAMIAN MYTHOLOGY AND ITS PRESENCE IN LATE ANTIQUITYThe suggestion that Hekhalot mystical descriptions may have evokedand reapplied Mesopotamian mythological themes is contingent onacknowledging the enormous distance which separates the ancientNear East and its vast diversity of mythical traditions from the realityof the Jewish mystics of late antiquity. Not only the historical, chrono-logical inconsistency, but also distinctions in evolving conceptual pat-terns, religious beliefs, personal behavior, and social codes create anapparently unbridgeable gap between the two cultures.14 Difficultiesin establishing, with full certainty, linear transmission of the Meso-potamian contents as well as modes of contact between literary tradi-tions also hinder an examination which goes beyond listing similaritiesand differences. At first glance such a conceptual and historical chasmseems to suggests that there are no proper grounds for linking or evenassociating Hekhalot and Merkavah accounts and the extensive an-cient Mesopotamian mythological tradition.It is important, however, not to confuse issues such as tracinginfluence, studying borrowed motifs, examining literary-cultural link-age, or constructing comparisons, with the phenomenological asser-tion suggested in this study. This investigation does not announce theMesopotamian mythological background as the origin of the Hekhalotand Merkavah literature. Nor does it suggest that this literature de-rives its mystical content from Mesopotamian mythology or its varia-tions. Instead, the study proposes that mythological themes andpatterns, rooted in ancient Mesopotamian traditions, and accessible inlate antiquity among other sources, were reapplied in the new evolv-ing context of the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature and thus ac-quired new mystical meanings.The study, therefore, does not intend to examine the transforma-tion and transmission of specific Mesopotamian mythological accounts,or of selected themes from the Bronze Age to Assyrian, Babylonian,Persian, and Hellenistic cultures in general, and Jewish circles in par-ticular. In fact, an avoidance of being tied to any particular evolution-ary model seems beneficial in this context. Yet, prior to an investigationof how selected ancient mythological themes were re-evoked, and re-embraced, it is important to consider their historical and literal avail-ability in the cultural world of late antiquity, in which Hekhalot andMerkavah mysticism emerged."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Mythical Language of Hekhalot and Merkavah Mysticism57Let us first consider biblical, post-biblical, and classical literaturesas mediating sources through which ancient themes could have reachedthe writers and compilers of the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature.Presence of ancient Near Eastern mythological traditions in biblicalsources have long been recognized. Explicit traditions in books suchas Genesis, Exodus, and Deuteronomy, as well as in prophetic litera-ture, Psalms, Lamentations, the Song of Songs and other texts demon-strate such a presence clearly.An effective example, as we shall see, isthat of the chariot vision of the prophet Ezekiel.15 Mythical images inthat vision correspond to Mesopotamian traditions, and in turn reso-nate as well in many of the Hekhalot descriptions, where they areframed in a mystical context.Various apocalyptic writings, such as the books of Daniel andEnoch, among other sources, also apply Near Eastern themes and tra-ditions, as early and more recent scholars have established.16 Onecompelling example is the Mesopotamian account of the antediluvianking of Sippar, Enmeduranki, to whom the gods had revealed thesecrets of divination. Versions of the Enoch traditions were partlymodeled on this account. As we shall see in chapter 4, echoes of thisstory occur also in the Hekhalot and Merkavah mystical narrations.17As mentioned earlier, explicit conceptual and literary connections linkHekhalot literature to both biblical and apocalyptic literature. Thus, itis conceivable that ancient mythological notions could have reachedthe Hekhalot and Merkavah mystical literature, albeit indirectly,through these biblical and apocalyptic sources.Indirect links between Mesopotamian traditions and the Hekhalotwritings may have occurred through other Jewish sources as well.Imprints from Mesopotamian sources are found in rabbinical texts,particularly in the fields of language, law, and agadic literature. TheTalmud and the Mishnah reflect such echoes, as do other folk lore andseveral Jewish ceremonies, apparently related to Babylonian religiousmyths. Further examples demonstrate the effect of Mesopotamian con-cepts in rabbinical hermeneutical techniques.18Non-Jewish sources may also be regarded as indirect channelsthrough which ancient Mesopotamian mythology could have reachedthe Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism. The presence of Meso-potamian mythic traditions in Greek mythology have been demon-strated by classical scholars. Evidence of Mesopotamian mythicalthemes has been observed as well in Greco-Roman magical and as-tronomical writings and in the syncretistic mythology of late antiq-uity. These traditions, available in the cultural context in whichHekhalot literature was compiled, could have been appropriated andreintegrated into its mystical content.19"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"58Beholders of Divine SecretsIt is possible to consider the availability of Mesopotamian mythduring Greco-Roman times. Regarding this matter, several factorsare relevant. We must look at the conservative character of theMesopotamian mythological tradition, and as well consider its persis-tence and lasting influence in the ancient Near East and Mediterra-nean worlds even up to the first few centuries of the common era.The mythological writings of the ancient Near East are in no wayhomogeneous. The component parts of its civilization vary from ademographic, political, social, and theological viewpoint.20 There are,however, common features which connect and distinguish the mytho-logical tradition in spite of its multiple literary voices and varied re-ligious ideologies.25 The Sumerian and later Akkadian, Babylonian,Assyrian, Hittite (Hurrian), and Ugaritic (Canaanaite) cultures devel-oped their own new and creative views, values, and narratives overtime. In this formative process, however, old traditions were not ig-nored or rejected, but rather reintegrated into the new forms. It ispossible to find consistency in conceptions of the pantheon, cult prac-tices, court ceremonies and rituals, cosmological and cosmogonicalconcepts, royal ideologies, temple traditions, as well as theories ofmagic and science.The common assumption that ancient Mesopotamian tradition andmyth did not endure after the death of cuneiform writing has beenlargely abandoned. Instead, scholars have recognized the persistenceof the Mesopotamian tradition up until the first few centuries of thecommon era. “Ideas do not necessarily die when the civilization thatnurtured them expires,” contends the assyriologist S. N. Kramer.22H. W. F. Saggs, in a similar manner, affirms:There was thus a demonstrably horizontal continuum be-tween the religious concepts of Israel and those of Syria andBabylonia. It follows, therefore, in view of the indisputablevertical continuum between Israelite religion and modernJudaism and Christianity (and less markedly, Islam), thatthe conceptual barrier between ancient Mesopotamia andmodern religious thought need not be as absolute.23Saggs points out several specific examples to support this state-ment. In Syria, worship of Assyrian deities was accompanied by cel-ebrations which corresponded exactly with the festival dates of thenew Assyrian period. These festivals were celebrated at least until thebeginning of the third century C.E. Isaac of Antioch, in the fifth cen-tury, was familiar with the continuing practice of the Tammuz cult, aswell as with the worship of the solar and lunar deities Shamash, Sin,and Bel-Shamin. Saggs also emphasizes that during the first centuries"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Mythical Language of Hekhalot and Merkavah Mysticism59C.E. early Christian figures such as Paul, the apostle and Clement ofAlexandria, made direct reference to pagan thought, literature, andmyths. Obviously these were rejected by the early Christians as fun-damentally invalid, but it is nevertheless important to note that manyof the mythological traditions in question were well-known duringthat time.24A. Heidel sites the Neoplatonist Damascius of the fifth andsixth centuries C.E., who was apparently familiar with the details ofthe Babylonian creation story, Enumah Elish, and was able to explainits theogony.25 Additional examples demonstrate the survival of theMesopotamian mythological tradition during the early centuries C.E.Versions of the Babylonian “Akitu festival” were preserved in copiesfrom the Seleucid period.26 The Lament over the City of Uruk, a Sumerianpoem from the third millennium B.C.E., was recopied at the beginningof the Hellenistic period. Translation of the Phoenician Theology by Philoof Biblos at the end of the first century C.E. shows the effect of Ugariticmyth, which was probably accessible at that time.27Over the last decade, scholarship on ancient Mesopotamian cul-ture has developed in significant ways. Recent findings has come tolight, as well as new methodological approaches and an awareness ofthe lasting presence and effect of this culture. Historical, textual andarcheological evidence demonstrates specific channels in whichMesopotamian traditions—embodied in literature, architecture, art, andmyths—have migrated not only to immediate neighboring cultures inthe Mediterranean and the Near East, but also to later cultures in lateantiquity and early Islam. Presenting an abundance of proof, scholarlyworks have traced systematically the legacy of Mesopotamia from thethird millennium B.C.E., and onwards into the Middle Ages.28S. Dalley, for example, demonstrates the survival of Mesopotamiantraditions in early Islamic texts.29 A. Salvesen determines the presenceof ancient Mesopotamian cults during the early centuries C.E., espe-cially in the Aramaic and Syriac cultures in Mesopotamia30 In theAramaic speaking region of northern Mesopotamia, works of Syriacwriters reveal the longevity of ancient Near Eastern mythologicalbeliefs. Worship of local forms of Mesopotamian deities, such as Sin,Shamash, Nergal, Nusku, Bel, and Nebo, continued well into the Chris-tian era in cities such as Harran, Edessa, and their surroundings.31T. M. Green, who has studied in particular the religious traditions ofHarran, reaches similar conclusions.32It is also worth noting that Akkadian cuneiform was used along-side Aramaic up to the time of the Neo-Babylonian Empire (626–539B.C.E.). The use of Aramaic prevailed as the principal means of communi-cation in the first centuries C.E., and probably transmitted ideas from theearlier cultures of Assyria and Babylonia. Mesopotamian astrological and"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"60Beholders of Divine Secretsastronomical traditions were absorbed into Aramaic and Syriac sources.Mesopotamian impact was also present in magical works and amu-lets, wisdom literature, court narratives, and dialogue poetry.33In order to discern specific evidence of the lasting existence ofancient Mesopotamian mythology in late antiquity, we will examinetwo cases, intended to serve as models. Chapters 4 and 5 will discussseveral Hekhalot and Merkavah mystical descriptions which seem toevoke themes from two Mesopotamian mythological accounts, theGilgamesh Epic and Enumah Elish, known as the Babylonian creationstory. As a study case, the discussion below seeks to demonstrate thatthese two traditions survived long after those in which they origi-nated. Furthermore, they were accessible in the cultural context inwhich the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature developed, in severallocations in Babylon and Palestine of late antiquity.Our first example is the Epic of Gilgamesh. The latest Akkadiantablets of the Epic of Gilgamesh come from Uruk of the late Babylonianperiod, some time after the fall of Babylon in 539 B.C.E., and perhapsas late as the Seleucid period, after the reign of Alexander the Great.34Versions of this narration continued to spread long after the cuneiformsystem of writing lost prominence. In his book The Evolution of theGilgamesh Epic, J. Tigay discusses the continually evolving oral tradi-tion of Gilgamesh during the late third and second millennium B.C.E.35Other scholars show that Gilgamesh mythical traditions continued topersist even in later times. During the Parthian period (141 B.C.E.–226C.E.) the Epic of Gilgamesh was copied anew at the library of the cityUruk.36 At Qumran, for example, an Aramaic version of a Book of Enochwas found among the fragments of the Dead Sea scrolls, dated to thelast century B.C.E. This version includes, as its second part, the Book ofGiants, a section which was probably replaced later in the Ethiopicbook of Enoch by the Similitudes. J. T. Milik, in his editions of thesefragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls, uncovers in them many referencesto Gilgamesh traditions. These include especially names and featuresof the main characters, which betray the influences of Hittite andAkkadian versions of Gilgamesh.37 J. C. Reeves reveals traces of theGilgamesh tradition in the Book of the Giants, one of the sacred booksof the Gnostic Manichaeans.38 This analysis suggests that Mani, whodied sometime in 274 or 277 C.E., probably used themes from the Epicof Gilgamesh in the formulation of his religious ideas. S. Dalley detectscomponents of the Epic of Gilgamesh not only in the Dead Sea scrollsand the tradition of Manichaean storytelling but also in later sources.Several of the Gilgamesh themes were incorporated into the AlexanderRomance, one of the most widely known pieces of fiction in late antiq-uity. They emerge later in versions of The Tale of Buluqiya and in the"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Mythical Language of Hekhalot and Merkavah Mysticism61Arabian Nights, sources which may be associated with the Islamic periodand with Sufi and Jewish mystical circles, including the Hekhalot andMerkavah literature.39Enumah Elish, known as the Epic of Creation, a Babylonian literarycomposition written in Akkadian, is our second example.40 Regardingthis work, historical and cultural conditions in the Near East of lateantiquity are of importance. In several cities in both the north and thesouth of Mesopotamia, various beliefs and practices of ancientMesopotamian origin were maintained. Among them is the cult of thegod Bel. As his name and attributes indicate, Bel assimilated the char-acteristics and traditions of the Babylonian city god Marduk.In Babylon Bel was the epithet for the god Marduk. This deityplayed a primary role in the Babylonian pantheon as the supreme godwho triumphed over the forces of chaos and established the cosmos.Since the time of King Hammurabi of Babylon, in the eighteenth cen-turyB.C.E., the god Bel-Marduk became the central deity of the pan-theon, playing a major role in the Babylonian story of creation, EnumahElish. During the New Year festival, akitu, the Epic of Creation wasrecited publicly and re-enacted with the intention of consolidating theorder of the cosmos with its symbolic reestablishment.41For a long time it has been assumed in the scholarly literature thatthis tradition ceased to exist in Greco-Roman times, especially afterthe cuneiform writing had disappeared. As new documentation sug-gests, however, this was not the case. S. Dalley brings forth evidencefrom various places in northern and southern Mesopotamia whichshows that the cult of Bel-Marduk and the celebration of the akitufestival continued in the Roman period. She documented the differentcities in which the akitu New Year festival was celebrated with thepublic recitation of Enumah Elish from the early Iron Age (c. 1000–539B.C.E.) until the Roman period.42 Supported by archeological, textual,and iconographical indications, Dalley concludes: “Aramaic inscrip-tions as well as new cuneiform texts and other pieces of evidence fromrabbinical, Classical and Syriac texts, show that cults of Bel continuedto flourish during the Parthian period both within and outside areascontrolled at times by Rome: at Palmyra, Dura-Europos, Apameaon-Orontes, and Harta, the cult, or at least its buildings, appears to benewly emerged, but at Ashore, Arbella, Harran, and Babylon powerfultraditions of great antiquity have survived into the Roman period.”43Dalley also attests that Bel-Marduk’s old ritual of the New Yearwas most likely performed with some kind of recitation of the EnumahElish. One interesting piece of evidence regarding this matter is a textdating from an indeterminate, late Babylonian period, which has beenpublished recently.44 It shows that the akitu festival was performed not"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"62Beholders of Divine Secretsonly once a year, but also on other occasions, with recitations of theEnumah Elish. In addition, as Dalley notes, the presence of an Aramaicloanword and an Aramaic verbal prefix is evident in this text. “Thisindicates that the text was not fossilized but absorbed some elementsof current language. This evidence opens up the possibility that anAramaic version of the epic was recited in second century Palmyra.”45“The language in which the epic of creation was recited began asBabylonian, but creeping Aramanicization may have resulted eventu-ally in an all-Aramaic version,” Dalley affirms.46Evidence from the city of Palmyra further indicates the enduranceofEnumah Elish in the first centuries C.E. During the Parthian period,one of its main temples was dedicated to the god Bel. An inscriptiondating from 44 B.C.E. mentions priests of Bel and thus shows that, inthat time, the city was associated with the cult of Bel. The temple ofBel was rebuilt from 32 C.E. onwards with partial funding from the cityof Babylon. This demonstrates the existence of the cult of Bel in Babylonas well. On a five meter long frieze, sculpted in the main doorway ofthe temple, is an image of the god Bel in his chariot, drawing his bowand shooting at Tiamat. This scene appears to correspond to descrip-tions in Enumah Elish. Furthermore, the temple was inaugurated in 32C.E. on the sixth day of Nisan, the date of akitu, the New Year festival.Many terracotta vessels, found in the temple of Bel, are thought tohave been used in the banquet held during the akitu festival in whichEnumah Elish was regularly recited. The cult of Bel persisted in Palmyraat least until 380 C.E., when pagan rites became forbidden byTheodosios. In Dura-Europos the cult of Bel was also known. A frag-ment of a wall painting dating from the late first century C.E., foundin a temple in Dura-Europos, appears to present Bel as a giant, prob-ably with a horse and a chariot. Excavations in the city Assur attestthat the akitu house, the temple of the New Year festival restored bySennacherib around 700 B.C.E., was rebuilt there according to its old plan.Dalley contends: “. . . it would certainly not have been restored unlessrituals performed there were still current . . . we cannot suppose that theold ritual for the New Year was performed without some kind of recita-tion of the Epic of Creation.”47 Even in the fifth century C.E. some versionofEnumah Elish, the Epic of Creation, probably not in cuneiform, was stillknown, as we learn from the writings of Damascius (born ca. 480 C.E.).H. J. W. Drijvers, in his studies of the pagan religions inMesopotamia of late antiquity, focuses on the city of Edessa in north-ern Mesopotamia as a model for registering the religious climate inother places in northern and southern Mesopotamia during Greco-Roman times.48 Among other examples, he demonstrates clearly thepersistence of the cult of Bel-Marduk and his festivals in Edessa in the"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Mythical Language of Hekhalot and Merkavah Mysticism63first centuries C.E. Christian documents provide specific evidence.Examples of these documents include the Doctrina Addai, dating fromthe end of the fourth century or the beginning of the fifth century C.E.This document, attributed to Jesus’ first apostle in Edessa, speaks ofworship of the god Bel and other deities in a polemic criticism ofpagan beliefs.49 Mention of Bel, among other gods, is made also inJacob of Sarug’sHomily on the Fall of the Idols from the fourth centuryC.E. Jacob, the bishop of Sarug (451–521C.E.), makes specific referencesto Bel in Edessa and various pagan gods in other places in Meso-potamia.50 Similar references to pagan practices in Edessa are found inthe polemic writings of Ephrem Syrus against pagan beliefs, especiallyin his Hymni contra Haereses.51Yet another example is found in the document The Acts of Sharbel,dating from the same period.52 This document which describes themartyr Sharbel, a pagan high priest of Edessa who converted to Chris-tianity, gives evidence of the dominance of the god Bel at Edessa. Thedocument furthermore mentions a central feast, which took place atEdessa at the beginning of Nisan [April]. During that time of festivi-ties, the gods were brought together, in a procession, to the highaltar at the center of the city. In the words of this document: “Thewhole population assembled near the big altar in the center of thecity . . . where all the deities were gathered, adorned and got a placeof honour: Nebo and Bel and other companions . . .”53 Dancing, music,and the reciting of ancient myths accompanied this celebration. Thedate of this celebration matches the Babylonian tradition in which thefestival of the New Year, akitu, took place.Joshua the Stylite’sChronicle, records the celebration of pagan ritesat Edessa in 497 and 498 c.e. From a disapproving Christian perspec-tive, he recounts what appears to be the celebration of the akitu festi-val and the recitation of the Epic of Creation: “There come round againthe time of that festival at which the pagan myths used to be recited,and the citizens took even more pain about it than usual.”54 A state-ment by the Jewish Rabbi, Rav, founder of the rabbinic school at Surain central Mesopotamia, probably after 219 c.e., further attests that thecult of Bel was well known at his time: “. . . there are five permanenttemples of idolatry: the Bel temple in Babylon, the Nebo temple inBorsippa. . . . “55As well, several Mesopotamian mythical traditions were clearlyavailable in late antiquity, the variety of evidence confirms. On certainoccasions in both the Assyrian and the Babylonian regions ofMesopotamia of late antiquity, the akitu festival was performed andthe Babylonian Epic of Creation,Enumah Elish, was recited in a formwhich could have been accessible. In addition, the Gilgamesh Epic was"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"64Beholders of Divine Secretswell known in Mesopotamia and in other areas in the first few centu-riesC.E. In this context, it is important to note that during the firstcenturies of the common era several major centers in Palestine andMesopotamia kept in close contact with one another. Thus, variousinteractions were unavoidable.56The data presented above allows us to acknowledge the existenceand availability of Mesopotamian mythological notions in the first fewcenturiesC.E., within the context of Near Eastern and Mediterraneancultures. The Hekhalot and Merkavah literature crystallized in this syn-cretistic context, which prevailed in both Babylonia and Palestine. Asseveral scholars attest, Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism reflects anattempt to mold new spiritual attitudes and religious views, both byconforming to existing Jewish teachings and by embracing other avail-able traditions. Explicit affinities, as mentioned, link the Hekhalot andMerkavah literature to apocalyptic sources, Greco-Roman magical-theurgical writings, the Dead Sea scrolls, the literature of early Chris-tianity, and to Gnostic traditions.57 As J. Dan maintains, the Hekhalot andMerkavah literature shows a tendency to keep true to the Jewish tradi-tion, follow the Halachah and the study of the Torah. Nonetheless, it alsore-embraces other nontraditional themes and conceptual patterns:What made the world of the ancient mystics unique whencompared to that of the Talmudic and Midrashic sages isespecially noticeable in the fact that this literature broughtabout the revival of Jewish sources from the second templeera—primarily the Enoch literature and the apocalypticliterature. . . . In this fashion the authors of this literature[Hekhalot and Merkavah] expressed their independent spiri-tual position, which is opposed to the attitude found in themidrashim of the Sages.58This attribute of the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature may also sup-port the prospect of re-envoking available Mesopotamian mythicalthemes in its new mystical context. It is true that unequivocal evi-dence proving either specific or exclusive evidence does not exist. Itnonetheless seems plausible to consider that the authors of Hekhalotand Merkavah literature could have formulated and conveyed theirmystical perception by reapplying Mesopotamian mythological themes,clearly accessible in the Greco-Roman world of late antiquity.CONCLUSIONContemplating the nature of the mystical discourse in Hekhalot andMerkavah mysticism, the study suggests that this tradition conceptu-alizes and conveys many of its mystical notions by evoking a variety"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Mythical Language of Hekhalot and Merkavah Mysticism65of mythological forms. As will be demonstrated in chapters 4 and 5below, various Hekhalot and Merkavah mystical notions, experiences,and revelations are formulated and expressed through mythologicalpatterns, supplemented by the re-application of specific themes rootedin biblical and Mesopotamian mythological traditions. As a method-ological introduction to a detailed literary-phenomenological analysisof the mythological language in Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism,this chapter distinguished the three prevalent mythological frameworks,presumed to be employed in it. It introduced dominant characteristicsof mythological forms of thought and expression in general, and ofbiblical, and Mesopotamian mythology in particular.Considering the pertinence and possible applicability of thesethree mythological forms in Hekhalot and Merhavah mysticism,this chapter further presented several observations. First, mytho-logical modes of thought and expression often convey a variety ofspeculative or abstract notions through methods such as pictorialimagery, tangible metaphors, and figurative language. These traits,among others, characterize many mystical narrations of the Hekhalotand Merkavah literature, conveying a distinctive feature of its myth-ological language. Second, since proficiency in all sections of theHebrew bible was required of all members of the Merkavah circle,evidently this group was familiar with the mythological material ofthe biblical corpus which, in turn, could have inspired severalmystical presentations. Third, sound and absolute affiliation be-tween Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism and Mesopotamian my-thology, or its variations, cannot be confirmed with certainty.This conclusion, however, does not exclude the probability thatmythological themes and patterns, rooted in ancient Mesopotamiaand available in late antiquity, were reapplied in its new evolvingcontext and thus acquired new mystical meanings. Avoiding anevolutionary model of investigation, the discussion did not tracetransformation and transmission of specific Mesopotamian mytho-logical accounts from the Bronze Age, Assyrian, Babylonian, Per-sian, and Hellenistic cultures, including Jewish traditions. Instead,it determined the availability of various Mesopotamian mythologi-cal traditions in the first few centuries c.e. within the context ofNear Eastern and Mediterranean traditions—the historical culturalsetting in which Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism had emerged.Based on this evidence, and in light of the view that traditionswithin a given cultural-religious group, or within neighboring cul-tures, interact with one another in an ongoing process of absorp-tion, transformation and interchange, we established the probabilitythat Mesopotamian mythological traditions, present in the syncretistic"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"66Beholders of Divine SecretsHellenistic-Roman world of late antiquity, could have inspired theHekhalot and Merkavah imagery, directly or indirectly.This present chapter provided the background for examiningmystical transformation of various mythological forms in the contextof the Hekhalot and Merkavah literary accounts, in a manner whichseems to correlate to a more widespread development, which A. Greenhas observed:In the post-biblical world . . . Jews and various competingversions of Judaism were important repositories for themythic imagination: sometimes figures from the archaic pre-biblical world reappeared with new vigor . . . at other timesnew motifs, including some borrowed from the surround-ing cultures of the Hellenistic world.59The following discussion will proceed in two parallel directions.The next two chapters will offer a literary-phenomenological analysisof the manner in which the three mythological frameworks are uti-lized in the new context of Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism. Chap-ter 6 will conclude the discussion by considering social-culturalimplications of the literary-phenomenological evidence."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"674Mystical Journeys inMythological LanguageINTRODUCTIONThe mystical journey is the focus of this chapter. The discussion willexamine the modes in which its various aspects are stated, with par-ticular emphasis on two issues: use of mythological patterns of thoughtand expression, and adoption of biblical and Mesopotamian mytho-logical themes. As chapter 2 has shown, many Hekhalot and Merkavahaccounts depict an inner processes of crossing conceptual-spiritualboundaries, which take place in the adepts’ imagination and mind. Bycontemplating and meditating on the Merkavah, visionaries embarkon an inner-mental journey, advancing from one level to the next to-wards their transcendent goal. They exercise various spiritual meth-ods and gradually expand their ordinary consciousness. At the end ofthe voyage, qualified “descenders to the chariot” cross the borderlinesbetween the human and divine. Then, for a short period of time, theyexceed common human perception, behold the King in his beauty, seevisions of the Merkavah, and comprehend the meanings of such rev-elations. We find descriptions of this process in a large number ofHekhalot and Merkavah accounts.Alongside these are other accounts, in which the process is exter-nalized. Instead of an inner journey we find in these a voyage pre-sented as a concrete, physical ascent to heavenly districts. The Hekhalotand Merkavah spiritual seekers are often portrayed as exceptionalheroes who initiate a dangerous, corporeal venture out of this world.They travel in an upwards direction and proceed towards actual royalpalaces of God, situated in physical upper heavens. On their way, theytour unknown paths of bright celestial territories in which wingedsacred beasts roam, glowing angels fly, and horses of fire wander.They experience adventures, cross bridges over rivers of fire, enter"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"68Beholders of Divine Secretsblocked gates, appease angry guardians, show magical seals, and re-peat secret passwords. During their journey these adepts encountermerciless ordeals, pass paradoxical tests, and overcome harsh dangersbefore they reach God’s throne. The spiritual-mental stages of theircourse are frequently conveyed by the precincts of an imaginary celes-tial geography; their feelings of fear and awe are personified; theirspiritual difficulties are made tangible; mythological patterns of asymbolic death and rebirth and of corporeal transformation are oftenapplied to denote their shifts of consciousness.An indirect form of mystical exegesis play a role in this presenta-tion. The mythological components are not deciphered by any specificexegetical system in the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature. Their newmystical context, nonetheless, introduces them in a fresh light, sug-gesting an alternate exegetical understanding. Common, public mytho-logical patterns as well as ancient themes from Near Eastern traditionsare utilized to convey personal, inner processes of traversing spiritualrealms and of attaining transcendent truth. Infused with new mean-ings these mythological forms express the Hekhalot and Merkavahmystical notions, as ancient threads are rewoven together to createnew visions. The following analysis will establish these observationsby focusing on three principal themes: the image of the visionary, thejourney, and the process of transformation at its end.THE MYSTICAL-MYTHICAL HEROIf you want to single yourself out in the worldso that the secrets of the worldand the mysteries of wisdomshould be revealed to you . . .1Various types of mystics are idealized in different traditions. Eachmodel embodies certain estimable paradigmatic traits and exemplifiesattributes considered to be of ultimate value to a specific religiousgroup. In certain traditions, for example, an ideal mystic is a self-reflective adept who considers inner-surrender to the divine as theultimate goal. Other mystical communities introduce the model of amoral and ethical disciple who follows authoritative teachings. Anemotional lover of God who strives to unite with the Source, a recep-tive, humble believer who is guided by the divine are likewise well-known exemplary images. If we try to characterize the “ideal mystic”of Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism, it seems that such a figure isportrayed in the paradigmatic image of a mythological hero.Beneficial for this discussion is S. Chatman’s conceptualization ofcharacter as a “paradigm of traits.”2 In Chatman’s view, characters are"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Mystical Journeys in Mythological Language69identified in their literary contexts by means of set traits which distin-guish them. The “paradigm of traits” is a constant construct. It is notdependent on specific situations or fluctuating tones present in theliterature. The characters, therefore, are continually portrayed, in avariety of accounts, by the same set of stable qualities and attributes.The discussion to follow will examine how the Hekhalot and Merkavahvisionaries are depicted by explicit characteristics, or “paradigms oftraits” which often portray the prototype of a mythological hero.MYTHOLOGICAL PATTERNSThe hero, a prevalent figure of world mythology, has been the subjectof numerous comparative studies, which have often emphasized thecommonality of all cultures and of their collective, universal construc-tion of the hero character. Acknowledging particular ethos and uniquenuances of varied cultures, such sweeping and often unfounded asser-tions have been challenged by contemporary scholarship. Nonethe-less, as S. Niditch has contended, recent comparative work on the heropatterns indicates that in a large cross section of mythological accounts,the hero figure can be distinguished by several common characteris-tics. With careful attention to conceptual differences between tradi-tions and their distinct forms of expression, scholars such as A. Dundes,A. B. Lord, and S. Niditch have asserted a number of such sharedcharacteristics, several of which are relevant to our discussion.3The hero figure is an exceptional figure of great energy, power,and courage, who often initiates a personal quest in order to achieveseveral seemingly unreachable goals. Convinced that he alone holdspower over his progress and hence over his success or failure, the herofigure assumes responsibility over his ventures, experiences difficulties,combats both natural and supernatural forces, as well as personal limi-tations. Against all odds he frequently achieves his objectives whichare not only of personal advantage but also of essential benefit to thecommunity at large.Several Mesopotamian narratives provide specific manifestationsof the hero model. These include, among other sources, the Sumerianand Akkadian versions of the story of Gilgamesh;4 the myth of Adapafound in fragmentary tablets from Tell el-Amarna in Egypt of thefifteenth or fourteenth centuries B.C.E., and from Assur of the secondmillenniumB.C.E.;5 and the myth of Etana, found in an old Babylonianversion from Susa and Tell Harmal, a middle Assyrian version fromAssur, and a standard version from Nineveh.6 These varied accountsare obviously different in their historical and conceptual contexts, lit-erary style, plot, and other details. An analysis of all such componentsis beyond the scope of this study. A phenomenological examination,"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"70Beholders of Divine Secretsnonetheless, reveals a similar “paradigm of traits” which distinguishesthe hero in all these accounts.7Portrayed as an exceptional being with unique characteristics andunequaled nature, Gilgamesh, the famous king of Uruk, is a primeexample. “Perfect in strength” and “perfect in awesomeness,” he sur-passes both the attributes and accomplishments of “every man” evenbefore he embarks on his various quests.8 Etana, chosen by the greatAnunna-gods to be the king of the city Kish, is likewise a superiorhuman being.9Adapa from the city Eridu is the first of the sevenantediluvian sages sent by the gods to bring civilization to human-kind. He, too, is depicted in the Babylonian legend as a man of supe-rior stature, “a sage—nobody rejects his word—clever, extra wise . . .holy, pure of hands.”10These figures pursue goals which cannot normally be accomplishedby human beings. They all attempt to move beyond the boundaries ofthe human world and enter divine realms which are clearly prohibitedto most mortals.11 T. Abusch’s observations of the separation betweenthe divine and human realm give a background against which thevaliant aspects of their mythical quest become clear. Abusch demon-strates the shift from an early Mesopotamian conception of a con-tinuum of celestial and the terrestrial realms to a tripartite conceptionof the structure of the cosmos.12 This tripartite arrangement establishesclearly defined boundaries that separate the three distinct districts ofEarth, Heaven, and the Underworld. Each cosmic realm is understoodas separate. The notion of a fluid movement between the realms wasreestablished as a threat to the structure of the universe. A Sumeriantext of Gilgamesh and the Land of the Living verifies this notion:A man, (even) the tallest, cannot reach heaven.a man (even) the widest, cannot cover the earth.13In spite of this basic human condition, the mythological sourcesmentioned above present a hero who strives not only to reach divinerealms, but also to achieve status and qualities exclusively associatedwith the gods. These accomplishments, if attained, can often benefitthe society at large and elevate its disposition.14Etana ascends to the remote heavens in order to find the plant ofbirth, which belongs to the gods. On the wings of an eagle, he travelsthe cosmic regions in search for the impossible.15 Adapa, the wisesthuman being, overcomes and disables the South Wind before he issummoned to the celestial realm.16 Refusing to consume the bread andwater of life offered to him by the high god Anu, he thus fails divinetests and looses immortality forever. Gilgamesh, superior in rank, sta-tus, and qualities, voluntarily undertakes two heroic journeys. First,"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Mystical Journeys in Mythological Language71he travels to the pine forest, in a “journey [which] is not to be taken,”wishing to create for himself “a name that endures.”17 Seeking eternallife after Enkidu’s death, Gilgamesh undertakes a second journeybeyond the borders of the mortal world, in order to attain other levelsof existence, and to transcend both his own human condition as wellas the common lot of all human beings. Both voyages are extremelydangerous. Gilgamesh, however, soberly faces opposition, trials, andobstacles which no human before him has ever encountered. His choiceis determined by himself alone as he states: “I am adamant: I shalltake the road . . . I shall face unknown opposition, [I shall ride alongan unknown] road.”18Even though the storylines and themes of each of these mythologi-cal accounts are different, they all present parallel paradigmatic featuresof the hero figure. Several aspects are particularly emphasized: uniqueattributes, a personal choice which leads to heroic deeds and persis-tence, an effort to depart from conventional geographical and temporalrestrictions, an attempt to surpass the human condition and to achievetranscendent qualities, and an intention to elevate human existence.HEKHALOT AND MERKAVAH MYSTICISMWell-known Tannaitic figures are depicted as the principal mysticsin the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature. The accounts identify themas Rabbi Ishmael, Rabbi Akiva, and Rabbi Nehunia ben Ha-Kanah.Yet, as scholars have pointed out, this presentation contradicts histori-cal and chronological evidence which is also supported by sourcessuch as the Talmud and Midrash. Consequently, the Hekhalot andMerkavah narratives are not regarded as sources of authentic bio-graphical information. Likewise the literary testimonies of mystics areconsidered pseudepigraphic by most scholars, and the historical iden-tity of the Hekhalot and Merkavah visionaries is still dubious.19Throughout the various Hekhalot and Merkavah accounts, how-ever, a consistent paradigmatic model of an “ideal mystic” is depicted.Regardless of the adept’s individual nature and literary biography, allqualified “descenders to the chariot” resemble one another in theirdisposition, goals, deeds, and accomplishments. They are character-ized as people of superior stature, who attempt an inconceivable jour-ney to divine domains in order to obtain celestial secrets as well as tobehold God and the Merkavah in a personal manner.20 In their distinc-tion as exceptional individuals and in the pattern and nature of theirjourney, the prototype of these mystics closely corresponds the figureof the mythological hero described above.The Hekhalot and Merkavah seeker is by no means a passive, pa-tient believer who waits or longs for divine revelation and for spiritual"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"72Beholders of Divine Secretsenlightenment. Nor is he an obedient, responsive disciple who surren-ders to God’s call, or is raptured in ecstasy.21 Rather, this visionary isportrayed as an active and determined figure, who initiates a corpo-real journey beyond the borders of the phenomenal world, with theexplicit purpose of reaching the divine. The visionary’s physical des-tination is the sky, where he finds the sacred palaces of God. He is self-motivated, sets the goal for himself, and ventures forth on a highlydangerous journey to heaven in order to fulfill his aim. The openingsentence of Hekhalot Zutarti is a good example of this attitude. In it, theadept’s own wish is clearly the primary motive for the journey:If you want to single yourself out in the worldso that the secrets of the world and the mysteries of wisdomshould be revealed to you . . .22In a similar fashion, in Hekhalot Rabbati, Rabbi Ishmael emphasizes theseeker’s own aspiration and asks:What are these songs which one reciteswho wishes to behold the vision of the Merkavah,to descend safely and to ascend safely?23In an alternative Hekhalot and Merkavah pattern the visionary ischosen as an emissary to the heavens in answer to an immediate andspecific social need. Thus, he leaves his safe reality and travels out ofthis world in order to seek a divine answer to a problem which threat-ens his community. Such a case is presented in Hekhalot Rabbati. Ac-cording to the pseudo-historical background, Rabbi Nehunia benHa-Kanah sends his disciple, Rabbi Ishmael, up to heaven to findout why the Roman Empire was allowed to decree the execution ofseveral Jewish sages.24Both these patterns agree, however, that the journey is extremelydangerous even to the point of being beyond accomplishment. Vari-ous Hekhalot and Merkavah passages state and restate that God’srealm is inaccessible to most humans. They proclaim the unpredict-able danger of divine proximity and the destructiveness of a directvision of God:Pleasant Presence, adorned Presence,Presence of beauty, Presence of flame,Presence of YHWH, God of Israel,when He sits on His throne of glory,and His loftiness is established in the seat of His adornment.His beauty is more pleasant than the beauty of mighty acts.His adornment is superior to the adornment ofbridegrooms and brides in their bridal canopy."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Mystical Journeys in Mythological Language73He who gazes at Him is instantly torn.He who glimpses at His beautyis instantly poured out like (the content of) a jug.25The traveler who launches such hazardous journey is aware, fromthe outset, of its obstacles and complications. He recognizes the tre-mendous difficulties and dangers awaiting him, yet remains entirelycommitted to his goals. Striving to behold the vision of God and theMerkavah, he aspires to ascend and descend unharmed, knowing thathe should be the one to earn this goal.Various personal qualities, associated with the figure of the “de-scender to the chariot,” correspond to the mythical hero model aswell. The Hekhalot and Merkavah adept is certainly introduced as anexceptional individual, equipped with distinctive spiritual and intel-lectual characteristics. A passage in Hekhalot Rabbati gives a tellingexample. Rabbi Ishmael inquires: “What is the quality [of the Merkavahseeker] like?”26 Rabbi Nehunia ben Ha-Kanah’s answer refers to pre-cise personal characteristics of such a figure. Every person, theoreti-cally, can attempt the journey. Only the most accomplished individuals,however, who manifests superb moral and excellent ethical attributes,elevated spiritual stature and extensive knowledge of Jewish tradition,can complete it:Anyone who is pure and is emptied of idolatry, incest, blood-shed, slander, false oaths, profanation of the Name, imper-tinence and in valid enmity, and who keeps every positiveand negative commandment.27Though these qualities may be seen as the standard religious andethical obligations of every Jewish believer, such a state of faultless-ness is admitted to be virtually impossible for anyone to achieve. RabbiIshmael is totally overwhelmed by these requirements. Distressed andfrustrated, he addresses his teacher Rabbi Nehunia ben Ha-Kanah andprotests that such an ultimate perfection in a human being is impos-sible: “If so, there is no end to the matter, for you have no human, withsoul in him, who is pure and emptied of these eight attributes.”28According to an alternative Hekhalot and Merkavah model, es-teemed ancestry and racial lineage are additional attributes whichqualify the travelers to the chariot. For example, in 3 Enoch, Metatron,prince of the countenance, argues with opposing angels on behalf ofRabbi Ishmael. They ask:. . . why have you allowed one born of a womanto come and behold the chariot?From what nation is he?From what tribe? What is his character?29"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"74Beholders of Divine SecretsMetatron contends that his virtuous genealogy and priestly lineageshould allow Rabbi Ishmael to enter the divine realm:He is the people of Israel, which the Holy One, blessed beHe, chose to be his people out of the seventy tongues. He isfrom the tribe of Levi, which presents the offering to Hisname. He is from the seed of Aaron, whom the Holy One,blessed be He, chose to be his own servant, and on whosehead He Himself bound a priestly crown to Sinai.30Even to the eligible individual, success is not assured. In order toreach the final destination and to enter the divine realm, the heromystic must face dangerous trials and tests, answer perplexing ques-tions and accomplish arduous tasks. Only his own virtues and strengtheventually assure his safety and success in these. The descender to theMerkavah is neither endowed with supernatural powers by which heperforms his mission, nor is he granted divine privileges which pro-tect him. On the contrary, an adept who wishes to descend and ascendsafely, must rely primarily on what wisdom, power, and determina-tion he brings with him on the quest. Before he attains divine revela-tion, the seeker’s worthiness must be proven by his own thoughts,perception, acts, and deeds throughout the journey.31According to several instructional accounts the Hekhalot andMerkavah hero mystic also plays a role in his community. After expe-riencing the heavenly reality, the visionary returns to the terrestrialworld. Following God’s decree, he is then obligated to testify beforehis group and to report the content of his visions:. . . tell my sons what I am doing during the morning andafternoon and evening prayers . . . teach them and tellthem . . . and testify to them whatever testimony you have.See what I do to the countenance of the face of Jacob, yourpatriarch, which is engraved for me on my throne of glory.32Such a testimony can be seen as a beneficial message to the con-gregation, especially in times of trouble. Both the pseudo-historicalsetting and the historical background support this suggestion. In thetimes of the Roman persecution of the Jews and after the devastationof the Jewish people following the destruction of the Second Temple,33a confirmed report of God’s existence in heaven could have greatlyconsoled the community. The few qualified visionaries, who ascend toGod’s realm, are able to witness an enduring divine order and conse-quently bring back to Earth consolation and hope. Through their per-sonal experience, they relieve the distressed human community and,in some ways, elevate their reality.34"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Mystical Journeys in Mythological Language75To summarize: mystical accounts in the Hekhalot and Merkavahliterature neither outline an optimal profile of the exemplary “descenderof the chariot” nor detail a uniform, standard criterion, which qualifiesan aspired visionary to become one. Furthermore, although the writ-ings recognize Rabbi Ishmael, Rabbi Akiva, and Rabbi Nehunia benHa-Kanah, well-known Tannaitic teachers, as the main heroes of theMerkavah mystical circle, this literary testimony is consideredpseudoepigraphic by most scholars. Thus, information concerning boththe historical identity of the Hekhalot and Merkavah visionaries, aswell as their characteristics is still unclear.Throughout the various Hekhalot and Merkavah accounts, how-ever, a consistent paradigmatic model of an “ideal mystic” is depicted.Such a figure is characterized by a “paradigm of traits,” which typicallyclassified the “hero,” a prevalent figure in large cross section of mytho-logical traditions, as representative Mesopotamian accounts illustrate.Distinguished by similar traits, motivations, and goals, the descendersof the chariot emerge as mystical-mythological heroes. Equipped withexceptional qualities, extraordinary virtues, and venerable rank, theyseek to separate themselves from geographical and temporal restric-tions, reach the heavenly realm, encounter the divine, and achieve ce-lestial secrets—all beyond ordinary human attainment. Recognizing thatsuch objectives are extremely dangerous or altogether unachievable, theseheroes consciously decide to pursue them, relying, it seems, on whatpowers and skills are within them that allow them to prevail.THE INNER-OTHERWORLDLY JOURNEY. . . the path of the heavenly ladderwith its one end on earth and one end onthe right foot of the throne of glory.35Evident in Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism are a great number ofaccounts which present a contemplative, spiritual journey or an ecstaticvoyage taking place in the adept’s imagination, vision, and belief. Severalprincipal passages illustrate these aspects. For example, in Hekhalot Zutarti,Rabbi Akiva is described as attaining the secret name in heaven duringa contemplative-meditative situation, “when he was beholding theMerkavah; and he descended and taught it to his students.”36 In the sametext, Rabbi Akiva recounts his vision: “I had a vision and I observed thewhole universe and saw it as it is. I ascended in a wagon of fire and gazedon the palaces of hail . . .”37Ma’aseh Merkavah presents Rabbi Ishmael’sintrospective experience as an ascent to heaven. While he remains onEarth, seated before his teacher, he travels in his mind to celestial realms."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"76Beholders of Divine SecretsRabbi Ishmael said: “Since I heard from Rabbi Nehunia benHa-Kanah my teacher this report...I stood on my feet andasked him all the names of the princes of wisdom, and fromthe questions that I asked I saw a light in my heart like thedays of heavens . . . since I stood up and saw my face shin-ing from my wisdom...I began to explain each and everyangel in each and each palace.”38Rabbi Nehunia ben Ha-Kanah’s trance journey in Hekhalot Rabbatioccurs in similar circumstances. He sits and contemplates among hisstudents in the terrestrial realm and beholds the throne of glory in avision. When his students wish to call him back from his state oftrance to ask him questions, they request Rabbi Ishmael, as their del-egate: “see if you can bring him back from the visions which he hasglimpsed.”39 Rabbi Ishmael then touches his teacher’s body on Earthwith an impure piece of fine wool. Consequently, Rabbi Nehunia benHa-Kanah is “dismissed from before the throne of glory where he hadbeen sitting and beholding.”40Attention to the introspective spiritual nature of the journey doesnot contradict its description as a concrete and physical expeditioninto cosmic regions. A variety of Hekhalot and Merkavah accountsrepropose the spiritual-inner voyage as a corporeal quest into supernatural worlds through several mythological themes and modes ofexpressions. The seekers’ conceptual experience of attaining God, itsprogressive stages, and the inner transformation at its end, are allconveyed in terms of external actions and manifested deeds, accom-plished in imaginary sites outside of the phenomenological realm.In his discussion of Near Eastern mythology R. J. Clifford notes:In the religions of the ancient near east, to characterize ratherbroadly, divine presence was sought not so much in mysti-cal inward searching of the soul but in symbolism where arelationship was established between the natural and super-natural worlds.41Such a pattern of reaching the divine is clearly evident in the Hekhalotand Merkavah mysticism, which exhibits aspects of the voyage througha variety of corresponding mythological themes and images. The de-scenders to the chariot ascend to heaven by foot or on the wings of adivine being. They cross cosmic geographical regions or climb up ona cosmic pole. They reestablish intimate, direct communication withGod, as in the first days of creation in the Garden of Eden. TheMerkavah devotees enter closed entrances guarded by terrifying guardsand encounter dangers, tests, and trials, all in order to prove theirvirtues and to advance towards the upper divine sphere. A physical"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Mystical Journeys in Mythological Language77transformation at the end of their journey completes the adventure.In such a manner, the mystical spiritual voyage and its variousphases are actualized and becomes concrete. Following are examplesof such representations.A JOURNEY THROUGH COSMIC REALMSBetween one bridge and another are twelve myriads of parasangs,in its ascent are twelve myriads of parasangs,and in its descent are twelve myriads of parasangs . . .42MYTHOLOGICAL PATTERNSA common feature of the mythopoeic thought is its concrete con-ception of space, scholars have long recognized.43 It does not imag-ine space to be infinite, continuous, and homogeneous but rather asdiscernible, demarcated, and visible. Examples are evident in mytho-logical accounts of Mesopotamia as well as in biblical references,which depict the conceptual division between the divine and hu-man realms through commonplace images of Heaven, Earth, andthe Underworld.44Tangible depictions of divine reality are evident in variousmythological accounts of Mesopotamia. The realm of the high godsis illustrated as a tangible world situated up in the sky. As W. G.Lambert, W. Horowitz, and other scholars have shown, this celes-tial realm is one of cosmic levels.45 Imagined as several superim-posed heavenly layers of equal size and shape, the transcendentrealm emerged as concrete. A detailed description of the cosmicphysical structure occurs, for example, in two ancient texts reflectingsimilar traditions. They present a six-tiered universe, composed ofthree heavens and three earths.46 In the upper realm, each one ofthe heavens is made of precious stones and is considered the do-main of one distinctive god:The upper heavens are of luludanitu-stones, of Anu,He settled the Igigi therein.The middle heavens are of saggilmu-stone, of the Igigi.Bel sat therein on the lofty dais in the chamber of lapis lazuli.He lit a lamp of elmesu-stone.The lower heavens are of jasper, of the stars,He drew the constellations of the gods thereon.Elsewhere we find a model of heaven with seven levels. A Sumerianincantation from the late second millennium B.C.E. reads: “Seven godsof the broad heavens. Seven gods of the broad land . . . Heaven seven,Earth seven . . .”47"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"78Beholders of Divine SecretsBased to such tactile illustration of the divine sphere, varioussources also determine concrete manners of reaching it. Thus, attemptsto overcome the polarity between gods and humans are often depictedas physical excursions from the human terrestrial to the divine super-natural domains. Several models are commonly employed: crossingthe heavens by foot or soaring on the back of a winged guide, travel-ing in divine unfamiliar territories and roads, and entering blockedgates of celestial palaces.48The legend of Etana, for instance, describes this mythologicalfigure crossing the gap between Heaven and Earth on the wings ofan eagle with the hope of attaining the plant of life from the gods.He ascends to Heaven, passes through the seven divine regions ofthe gods Anu, Enlil, Ea, Sin, Shmash, Adad, and Ishtar, and enterstheir seven heavenly gates:49After they had [flown up to the heaven of Anu],[They passed] through the gates of A[nu, Enlil, and Ea].The eagle and [bowed down together][They passed through the gates of Si[n Shamash, Adad and Ishtar].The eagle and [ bowed down together].50Portrayed as a guide-figure, the eagle carries Etana on his wings anddirects his cosmic tour while indicating the significant sights revealedduring the journey:He put his arms over its sides,put his hands over the quills of its wings.[the eagle] took him upward for a mile.“My friend, look at the country!How does it seem?”51A similar mythical structure of the upper realm is found in atemple’s inscription dedicated to the god Anu and his consort Antum,S. Dalley has observed. According to the temple’s inscription, attrib-uted to Anu-uballit Nikarchos in 222 B.C.E., the temple’s structure in-cluded significant symbolic features. It had three gates which openoutwards, and seven courts around a courtyard in which the shrine ofdestinies is found.52 According to Dalley, this temple’s plan reflects atonce the arrangement of the universe, as it was conceived at the timeof building, and the way of approaching the high god. Thus, sevenheavens or palace-courts had to be crossed before the worshiper comesface-to-face with the enthroned deity of cosmic destinies.A corporeal ascent to the celestial realm is pictured as well in themyth of Adapa. In order to reach the high god Anu Adapa, human,leaves the boundaries of the earthly world, walks through divine trails,"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Mystical Journeys in Mythological Language79and mounts his way to the highest heaven. Before his departure thegod Ea instructs Adapa, outlining the procedures.He made him take the [Pa]th of Heaven,and he went up to heaven.When he went up to heavendrew near the Gate of Anu,Tammuz and Gizzida were standing at the Gate of Anu.53Gilgamesh’s quest for immortality is also conceived as a corporealexpedition in super-natural domains. Departing from the boundariesof the human world, he goes on a tangible journey to the mythicalrealm of the gods, where the only human survivor of the flood, Ut-napishtim, dwells. In the course of his route, Gilgamesh visits variouslegendary locations such as the mountain Mashu, the mythical moun-tain of the sun, or the jewel garden in which “trees are blossomingwith gemstones.”54 Distrustful, he roams divine territories while try-ing to find directions to regions where no man has tread before:Give me directions, [whatever they are];give me directions.If it is possible, I shall cross the sea;If it is possible, I shall roam open country again.55Biblical sources offer a multifaced image of the divine reality de-picted as heaven or sky by the Hebrew term shamayim ().56 Thisterm, which appears with the standard dual ending, is in fact pluralin its grammatical form. Thus, several scholars have derived a biblicalnotion of plural heavens from this form. Furthermore, the Hebrewphrase “heaven and the heaven of heaven(s) has been thought bysome to state a cosmic image which includes multiple heavens. Aconcrete concept of the upper realm is expressed in several biblicalsources. For example, Genesis 1:6–8 depicts a material lower heaven,namely the firmament or dome (), which serves to barricade thewater of the upper heaven.57 Allusion to God’s creation in Isaiah 45:12offers a visual and tangible view of heaven as the world’s canopy orcosmic tent: “I made the earth, and created humankind upon it; it wasmy hand that stretched out ( ) the heavens.” Exodus 24: 9–10 de-scribes the concrete heaven revealed to Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu,and seventy of the elders of Israel on Mt. Sinai, when they “saw theGod of Israel. Under his feet there was something like a pavement ofsapphire stone, like the very heaven for clearness.”HEKHALOT MYSTICISMSeveral Hekhalot and Merkavah accounts conceptualize God’s realityneither as a transcendent, boundless sphere, nor a conceptual realm."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"80Beholders of Divine SecretsInstead the reality of the divine is pronounced through a widespreadimagery as the tangible, highest district of heavens. Clusters of mythi-cal features give shade and color to this picture, echoing, it seems,biblical and Near Eastern themes. Seven parallel superimposed levelsmake up the upper cosmic sphere. Each is viewed as a demarcatedgeographical region, defined by a name and containing its own par-ticular conditions. In several accounts the names of the seven heavensare given: Aravot, Makon, Maon, Zebul, Shehaqim, Raqia, Wilon.58Other descriptions give additional detail to substantiate the mythicalimage of the divine sphere. According to 3 Enoch, for example, God’spalaces are located in distinct upper realms, each is governed by adivine prince:There are seven lofty, fearful, marvelous, and noble princeswho are in charge of the seven havens. . . . They are allprinces over a heavenly host, and every one of them isattended by 496,000 myriads of ministering angels.Michael, the Great Prince, is in charge of the seventh heaven,the highest which is in Aravot;Gabriel, Prince of the Host, is in charge of the sixth heaven,which is in Makon;Shatqiel, Prince of the Host, is in charge of the fifth heaven,which is in Maon;Shahaqiel, Prince of the Host, is in charge of the fourth heaven,which is in Zebul;Baradiel, Prince of the Host, is in charge of the third heaven,which is in Shehaqim;Baraqiel, Prince of the Host, is in charge of the second heaven,which is in Raqia;Sidriel Prince of the Hosts, is in charge of the first heaven,which is in Wilon.59Clearly the upper realm of Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism isnot discerned as an abstract, infinite continuum, but rather as aseries of separate, finite celestial realms identified by names, andguarded by celestial governor-princes.60 Majestic palaces are situ-ated in each of the heavenly realms, adding more detail to thismythical landscape. A description in 3 Enoch pictures this hierarchi-cal, structural sphere comprised of seven heavens, seven palaces,and seven angelic guards:The guardian of the entrance of the first palace, when theysee the guardians of the entrance of the second palace, theyremove their splendid crown and fall prostrate. The guard-ian of the entrance of the third palace, when they see theguardians of the entrance of the fourth palace, they remove"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Mystical Journeys in Mythological Language81their glorious crown and fall prostrate. The guardian of theentrance of the fourth palace, when they see the guardians ofthe entrance of the fifth palace, they remove their splendidcrown and fall prostrate. The guardian of the entrance of thefifth palace, when they see the guardians of the entrance ofthe sixth palace, they remove their glorious crown and fallprostrate. The guardian of the entrance of the sixth palace,when they see the guardians of the entrance of the seventhpalace, they remove their glorious crown and fall prostrate.61It is important to note that this picture is not employed in a sym-bolic manner to be deciphered thereafter. It is introduced rather as analternative mythical reality which the descenders to the chariot expe-rience and explore in a direct and personal fashion. The spiritual pursuitof divine presence is depicted in many passages as an active, corpo-real ascent through these heavenly realms. Rabbi Ishmael in 3 Enoch,for example, states his experience:When I ascended to the height to behold the vision of thechariot, I entered six palaces, one inside the other, and whenI reached the entrance of the seventh palace, I paused inprayer before the Holy One . . .62We find here, as in other Hekhalot and Merkavah accounts, a commonpresentation of mystical notions conveyed in mythological modes. Thepresence of God is found within his actual and concrete abode inheaven. The mystic-hero ascends to heaven, crosses the different realms,walks in God’s halls, steps into the seventh palace and then utters hisprayers. In this passage active verb forms exhibit the spiritual process.The focus shifts from an internal, personal perspective to an external,cosmic scene.An additional mythological metaphor represents the notion ofseeking the divine. The Merkavah devotees are portrayed as travel-ers trying to find their way in foreign regions. They ask for direc-tions, look for geographical locations, estimate distances and inspectthe celestial topography. In a passage in Ma’aseh Merkavah we readthe following:How many bridges (are there)? How many rivers of fire? Howmany rivers of hail? How many treasures of snow? How manywheels of fire? How many angels of service? (There are)twelve thousand myriads of bridges, six above and six be-low. Twelve thousand myriads of rivers of hail, six aboveand six below. Twelve thousands myriad of storehouses ofsnow, six above and six below. (There are) twenty-fourmyraids of wheels of firs, twelve above and twelve below."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"82Beholders of Divine SecretsAnd surrounding the bridges, the rivers of fire, the rivers ofhail, the treasures of snow, the angels of service—how manyangels of service (are there) at each passage and passage?And each creature and creature stands in the midst, facingall paths of heaven.63Often the Merkavah seeker verifies specific details with anotherexperienced traveler, who is able to offer directions and to point theright track in the upper unfamiliar domains. Thus, we read RabbiIshmael’s testimony:I asked Rabbi Akiva how many measures are between onebridge or another? He said to me: Between the one bridgeand the other are twelve myriads of parasangs, in its ascentare twelve myriads of parasangs, and in its descent are twelvemyriads of parasangs. Between the rivers of awe and therivers of fear are twenty-two myriads of parasangs. Betweenthe rivers of hail and the rivers of darkness are thirty-sixmyriads of parasangs. Between the chambers of lighteningand the clouds of consolation are forty-two myriads ofparasangs. Between the consoling clouds and the Merkavahare eighty-four myriads of parasangs.64The interior components of these upper zones are also distinguishedin a tangible manner. Chariots, cherubim, ophanim, sacred camps, andpalace’s chambers serve as the mythical landmarks of the private di-vine space. Their location needs to be registered and marked by thetraveler who searches the route to his final destination, namely, God’sthrone of glory:Between the Merkavah and the cherubim are one hundredsixty-eight myriads of parasangs. Between the cherubim andthe ophanim are twenty-four myriads of parasangs. Betweenthe ophanim and the chambers of the chambers are twenty-four myriads of parasangs. Between the chambers of cham-bers and the holy beasts are forty thousand myriads ofparasangs. Between one wing and another are twelve myri-ads of parasangs. And their width is similar. From the holycamps to the throne of glory are thirty myriads of parasangs.And from the foot of the throne of glory to the place onwhich sits the holy King, high and exalted ANPKA YHWHGod of Israel, are forty thousand myriads of parasangs. Andhis great name is declared exhalted there.65In many of these descriptions the corporeal aspects of the journeyare emphasized. Yet, the inner dimensions of the process are likewiseacknowledged. The transition from Earth to Heaven through superim-posed and stratified celestial regions corresponds to the seeker’s spiri-"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Mystical Journeys in Mythological Language83tual development and his inner moral-ethical progress. A passage inMa’aseh Merkavah, discussed earlier, articulates this concept:I asked Rabbi Akiva how many measures are thus betweenone bridge and the other. Rabbi Akiba said to me: “Werestraightness and righteousness in your heart then you wouldknow how many measures are in heaven.” He said to me:“When I was in the first palace, I was righteous, in the sec-ond palace, I was pure, in the third palace, I was upright, inthe fourth palace, I was perfect, in the fifth palace I arrivedholy before the king of king of kings, blessed is his name.”66An additional mythological theme which expresses the contem-plative journey is that of flight. A winged heavenly being helps andguides the human adept to come closer to God’s seventh heaven. In3 Enoch, for instance, Enoch is carried to the height of heavens on “thestormy wings of the Shekinah.”67 The same account pictures RabbiIshmael’s mythical flight. After ascending to the seventh palace, he isrescued from the fierce gatekeepers by Metatron, prince of the divinepresence. Metatron places him on his wings and leads him throughthe heavenly realm, explaining its unfamiliar sites:Come and I will show you where water is suspended in theheight, where fire burns in the midst of hailstones, wherelightning flashes in the midst of mountains of snow, andwhere thunders rumble in the height of heights, and whereflame blazes in the midst of burning fire . . . and I went withhim. Taking me by his hand he bore me up on his wingsand showed me all these things.”68Echoing the mythic depiction of Elijah’s chariot of 2 Kings 2:11,a “wagon of radiance” or a “fiery” chariot are additional parallelimages by which the spiritual-contemplative journey becomes con-crete.69 As a passage in 3 Enoch attests, the angel Anafi’el carriesEnoch to heaven “in great glory on a fiery chariot with fiery horsesand glorious attendants.”70 In Hekhalot Rabbati, in a similar manner,the accomplished adept is a heavenly rider, whose merits are veri-fied, written down by the angel Gabriel, and posted on a celestialcarriage. In this carriage the visionary crosses heavenly spheres,accompanied by angels and the blowing of myriads of horns, so thefierce gatekeepers realize his distinction, sheathe their weapons, andallow him into the seventh palace:When the guards of the gate of the seventh palace see him,with Dumiel and Gabriel and Katspiel proceeding beforethe carriage of the man who is deserving and descends tothe Merkavah.

Images, such asmountains, ladders, ropes, trees, temples, or staircases, give concreterepresentation to this idea. Each of these, in its way, establishes atangible link between the Heavens, the Earth, and the Underworld.They enable the passage from one level to another, or from one modeof existence to a higher or a lower one.73Various Near Eastern examples exemplify this notion. Cosmic polesare often depicted as cables, ropes, mountains, ladders, or temples.74According to Mesopotamian and biblical views, they allow movementand communication between cosmic regions.75In the Enuma Elish known as the Babylonian creation story, for ex-ample, the god Marduk builds his temple in Babylon, which unites thethree cosmic realms, Heaven, Earth and the Underground Apsu, andthus establishes communication between the upper and the lower gods:Whenever you come up from the Apsu for an assembly,Your night’s resting place shall be in it, receiving you allWhenever you come dawn from the sky for an assembly,Your night’s resting place shall be in it, receiving you all.76This description marks out Marduk’s temple tower, or ziggurat, asa cosmic pole. Its name, Esagila, literally “the House that lift its head(high),” affirms this designation. Titles of other Babylonian sanctuariesreflect a similar intent, implying that temples, and specifically templetowers link the Heaven and Earth: the temple of the God Anu at Urukis titled the “Palace of Heaven and Underworld.” The ziggurat atBorsippa is known as the “House which Gathers the Seven of Heavenand Underworld.” The ziggurat of the God Adad in Assur is the “Housewhere Heaven and Underworld Mingle.” Ishtar ’s temple at Nippurand the ziggurat at Larsa are “The Bond of Heaven and Earth.”77 Templehymns are associated with similar images. The hymn for the zigguratEunir states: “Eunir, which has grown high (uniting) heaven and earth,Foundation of heaven and earth.” The hymn for the Kesh templedeclares: “Temple, whose platform is suspended from heaven’s midst,whose foundation fills the Abzu.”78"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Mystical Journeys in Mythological Language85A relief dated 850 B.C.E. from the reign of the neo-Babylonian kingNabu-Apla-Iddina establishes a pictorial and highly symbolic mani-festation of this mythical idea.79 The relief depicts a scene from thetemple of the sun God in Sippar, in which the temple, represented inthe relief as a pillar, rests on the lower parts of the cosmos and reachesthe celestial level where the God Shamash sits. As T. N. D. Mettingerhas noted, in the right half of the relief, the god Shamash sits on histhrone above. The left half depicts a procession in Shamash’s templebelow. Events in the temple, it appears, occur simultaneously on theterrestrial and the celestial spheres, exhibiting the temple’s role as thelink between the two realms.80 Seals from Anatolia, Syria, and Assyriacontain similar pictorial representations of this concept. They displaya winged disk, representing the sky above, supported by one or twopillars which are rooted in the Earth below.81References to mythic imagery of cosmic pillars are present invarious biblical sources as well.82 The book of Job, for example, states:“The pillars of heaven tremble and are bewildered at his rebuke”(26:11).83 In Psalm 11:4 the temple is depicted as a pole betweenheaven and earth: “Yahweh is in his holy temple, his throne inheaven.”84 A similar mythical image appears in Jacob’s dream whenhe sees “a stairway set up on the earth with its top reaching theheavens” (Gen. 28:12).HEKHALOT AND MERKAVAH MYSTICISMHekhalot and Merkavah accounts employ compatible concrete repre-sentation of cosmic poles in order to convey the manner in whichcommunication with the divine can be achieved. A passage in HekhalotRabbati describes an axis mundi on which the universe is constructed.This image consists of a pole which links Heaven and Earth, or a ladderwhich stands on Earth and leads to Heaven and to the throne of God.When Rabbi Nehunia ben Ha-Kanah reveals to the members of hiscircle, the “heroes of the assembly” all the secrets of ascent he recounts:I will reveal before them (members of the assembly) themysteries, the hidden, the suppressed, wonders, and theweaving of the web on which the completion of the worldand its exultation stand. And the axle of heaven and earthon which all the wings of the earth, and all the wings of theuniverse, and the wings of the high firmament, bound,sewed, attached, are suspended. And the path of the heav-enly ladder, with its one end on earth, and one end on theright foot of the throne of glory.85The ambiguous term bandaba in Hekhalot Zutarti exhibits a similarconceptual image. A cosmic pole established at the beginning of time,"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"86Beholders of Divine Secretsprior to the creation of Heaven and Earth, connects the upper andlower realms:Before YHWH worked the heavens and the earth,[he] fixed a bandaba to heaven to ascend [by] itand to descend [by] it.86A description in the Genizah depicts a cosmic pole around which theworld exists. It is imagined as an axle “on which the perfection of theworld is fastened and tied to its top.”87 In Hekhalot Rabbati, an imageof a peg, founded in the dawn of time, denotes a similar concept:. . . when you insert the peg of the weaving of the web,on which the completion of the world and its exaltation stand,many years, generations without end.88The cosmic poles assume a practical function in several Hekhalotand Merkavah accounts, enabling mortal and divine beings to movefrom one cosmic sphere to another. A passage in Hekhalot Rabbatimentions a ladder on which the angels ascend from Earth to Heaven.89Additional accounts, as well, describe a rope, which joins the terres-trial and celestial realms and allows worthy mystics to ascend anddescend safely.90 A ladder is also considered a means of ascension inthis literature, as Rabbi Ishmael states: “It is like having a ladder inone’s house on which he ascends and descends and there is no crea-ture who can prevent him.”91A RETURN TO PARADISEWhen the Holy One, removed mefrom the generation of the Flood,he . . . brought me into the great palacesin the height of the heaven Aravotwhere the glorious throne of the Shekinahis found . . .92MYTHOLOGICAL PATTERNSSeveral studies have explored the mythical concept entitles by M. Eliadeas a “nostalgia for paradise,” and its presence in the Hebrew bible.93This mythical concept conveys, through narratives and images, thedesire to transcend the human condition, return to a mythical perfectpast, recover a direct means of communication with God and evenattain a divine state of existence.One of its expressions appears in various traditions of Eden, whichreflect longing for an ideal form of existence preceding the rift be-tween the divine and human. M. Fishbane discusses the implicationsof this mythical concept in ancient Israel: “The garden of Eden thus"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Mystical Journeys in Mythological Language87symbolizes primordial harmony and order in space, a channel of di-vine blessing and beneficence which has ruptured with the primordialhuman transgression of the divine interdiction.”94 Fishbane relates thetopological replication of the archaic imagery of Eden to other institu-tions and texts. He notes: “It is the basis for a profound inner biblicalnostalgia for spatial harmony that attached itself—repeatedly in his-tory—to certain spatial institutions or loci which were left to embodythis longing.”95 For instance, in several biblical accounts, echoes fromEden are associated with Canaan, Zion, and the temple of Jerusalem.In this way, these places and institutions became the focus for futurehope and yearning.96HEKHALOT AND MERKAVAH MYSTICISMThe theme of “nostalgia for paradise,” evoked in Hekhalot andMerkavah mysticism, offers an additional pattern of a tangible attain-ment of God. The opening passages of 3 Enoch illustrate this notion.The account of Enoch’s ascension to heaven opens with a descriptionof the ideal harmonious state of the past. As the account asserts, at thebeginning human and divine realms were connected, even after theexpulsion from Eden. God’s presence, the Shekhinah, remained acces-sible on Earth, allowing humans to experience the divine and even togaze at his image. Rabbi Ishmael quotes Enoch’s nontraditional ver-sion of the Eden narrative, and outlines the nature of this harmoniousand blissful time:From the day that the Holy One, blessed be he, banished thefirst man from the garden of Eden, the Shekinah resided ona cherub beneath the tree of life. The ministering angelsused to jump and come down, sections from heaven, to roamthe whole world. And the first man and his generation sit atthe entrance to gaze at the image of the brilliance of theShekinah, for the brilliance of the Shekinah was travelling fromone end of the world to the other end . . .97The passage speaks then about human wrongdoing and idolatry,which caused the total separation of the divine and human realms:. . . until the coming of the generation of Enosh, who wasthe chief of all the idolatrous in the world. What did thisgeneration do? They treaded the world from end to end,each of them brought silver, gold, precious stones, and pearls,in mountains and heaps. And they fashioned them into idolsin the four quarters of the world . . .98As a consequence of these sins, God removed his Shekhinah fromEarth, away from the presence of wicked people:"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"88Beholders of Divine SecretsImmediately, the Holy One, blessed be removed the Shekinahfrom the earth from their midst. At that time the ministeringangels came, and the cohorts of the hosts . . . They took trum-pets and seized the horns in their hands, and surroundedtheShekinah with hymns and songs, and it ascended to theheavenly heights.99This narration in 3 Enoch articulates clearly the primordial sepa-ration between human beings and the divine. The account proceedsto suggest a possible method of reestablishing the perfect situationof the beginning. Even after this divorce between divine and human,several distinguished and exceptional human beings, such as Enoch,can still ascend to heaven and regain the presence of God. In hispersonal and direct encounter with the divine, Enoch experiences,once again, undivided existence just as before the rupture:. . . when the Holy One removed me from the generation ofthe Flood, he lifted me up on stormy wings of the Shekinahto the highest heaven and entered me into the great palacesin the height of the heaven Aravot, where there are the glo-rious throne of Shekinahand Merkavah . . .100Enoch transcends human terrestrial reality and attains an existenceshared with the divine. In Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism he be-comes, in effect, a prototype for all Merkavah seekers. He is one whohas accomplished this goal, leading the way for others. This pattern of“returning to paradise” is not exclusive to Enoch, however. The jour-ney suggested in several Hekhalot and Merkavah accounts is one thatcan be repeated by all qualified members of the Merkavah circle whofollow Enoch’s model.101This account in 3 Enoch evokes echoes from two other biblicalmythological narratives, namely Genesis 2–3 and Ezekiel 28:11–19.Themes from these sources seem to be reapplied in 3 Enoch in a mys-tical context. They give background to the goal of transcending thehuman condition and of recovering direct and personal communica-tion with God.102 The two biblical accounts present a transition fromthe harmonious primordial existence to a separated and thus imper-fect reality. Each story attributes this shift to wrongdoing, sin, anddisobedience.103 The Genesis narrative describes first the harmony inEden and then the expulsion of the first couple from this ideal divinehabitation, after transgressing God’s command. In Ezekiel 28, theprophet Ezekiel announces God’s judgment against the prince of Tyre.He compares the proud prince of Tyre to an anointed cherub, full ofwisdom and perfect in beauty, who dwelled in Eden. Reminiscent ofGenesis 2–3, this Eden also represents the divine abode, identified as"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Mystical Journeys in Mythological Language89both the garden and the mountain of God. Because of his sin, thecherub is cast out of the garden and thus primeval harmony is broken:You were the signet of perfection, full of wisdom and per-fect in beauty. You were in Eden, the garden of God; everyprecious stone was your covering, carnelian, chrysolite, andmoonstone, beryl, onyx, and jasper, sapphire, turquoise,and emerald; and worked in gold were your settings andyour engravings. On the day that you were created theywere prepared. With an anointed cherub as guardian Iplaced you; you were on the holy mountain of God; youwalked among the stones of fire. You were blameless inyour ways from the day that you were created, until iniq-uity was found in you In the abundance of your trade youwere filled with violence, and you sinned; so I cast you asa profane thing from the mountain of God, and the guard-ian cherub drove you out from among the stones of fire.Your heart was proud because of your beauty; you cor-rupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor. I castyou to the ground (Ezekiel 28:13–17).Ancient Mesopotamian mythological echoes of both Genesis andEzekiel 28 have long been noted.104 In the context of this discussion,however, we leave aside questions of origin, source, textual connec-tions, and interpretation of these tradition. Instead, we examine sev-eral selected themes and terms, which seem to re-emerge in 3 Enoch.The notion of ideal human-divine harmony is associated in Gen-esis and in Ezekiel with images of both the Garden of Eden and theGarden of God. A cherub figure appears in the two biblical accounts.In Genesis, the cherubim guard the way to the tree of life, after theexpulsion from Eden (Gen. 3:24); In Ezekiel, a cherub exists in thegarden, covered with precious stones (Ezekiel 28:14). Both biblicalstories identify disobedience and the overstepping of boundaries asthe main reason for the ending of ideal primeval harmony betweengod and humanity. The Genesis account describes the transgressionof divine order and commands by human beings; Ezekiel condemnsthe cherub’s sins of arrogantly transgressing the legitimate limits ofhis powers.Several of these mythological themes seem to be reintroduced in3 Enoch. These include the Garden of Eden, the cherub, the preciousstones, and the notion of sinning and violating ideal harmony. Theabsolute perfection of the beginning is depicted in 3 Enoch by referringto the Garden of Eden, in which divine and human beings communi-cated freely. Thus, we read: “The first man and his generation dweltat the gate of the garden of Eden so that they might gaze at the bright"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"90Beholders of Divine Secretsimage of the Shekinah.” A cherub is mentioned also in this context:“theShekinah resided on a cherub beneath the tree of life.” Acts ofsinning and transgressing limits are the main reasons for breaking thedivine-human mutual existence in 3 Enoch. The narrative presents thetransgressive acts of Enosh and his generation as the reason for re-moving God’s presence, the Shekhinah, from Earth to Heaven. Preciousstones, a typical motif in Ezekiel 28, reappears in 3 Enoch as part ofEnosh’s generation’s idolatry: “each of them amassed silver, gold,precious stones, and pearls in mountainous heaps and piles.”These mythological references are not used in their original formbut are rather reshaped and readjusted in order to convey new mys-tical notions. Unlike the biblical accounts, 3 Enoch provides a redemp-tive option by introducing a mystical alternative of attaining theMerkavah and the presence of God. Several deserving human beingssuch as Enoch, Rabbi Nehunia ben Ha-Kanah, Rabbi Akiva, RabbiIshmael, and the worthy descenders to the chariot, can cross the gapbetween the terrestrial and the celestial realms and reconstruct theEdenic harmony of the beginning. They behold God and his Shekhinah,and are thus able to overcome the rift between the two realities duringthe extent of their mystical experience. Such is Rabbi Akiva’s experi-ence reported by Rabbi Ishmael to the members of the Merkavah circle:Rabbi Ishmael said:Thus Rabbi Akiva said to me:I recited a prayer and beheld the Shekhinahand saw everything that one doesbefore the throne of glory.105HEAVEN’S GATESAt the entrance to the seventh palace stand and rage all heroes,ruthless, powerful and hard, terrible and frightening,higher than mountains and more polished than hills.106MYTHOLOGICAL PATTERNSImages of guarded doors, blocked gates, bolts, bars, and locks arecharacteristic to various mythological traditions including that of theancient Near East. Many accounts situate the gates between the hu-man world and the realm of the gods.107 The gates define boundariesbetween the celestial and terrestrial worlds, and emphasize the funda-mental distinction between gods and humans in a concrete fashion.Examples are many. Etana goes up to Heaven and passes the sevengates of the gods, namely, Anu, Enlil, Ea, Sin, Shamash, Adad, andIshtar.108 In other sources, the same imagery is repeated in relation tothe same gods, as the hymn to the sun god Shamash demonstrates:"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Mystical Journeys in Mythological Language91O Shamash, you have opened the bolts of heaven’s doors.You have ascended the staircase of pure lapis lazuli.You open up the closed bolts of heaven.109Babylonian texts such as the hymns to the Gods of the night likewiseemploy images of gates: “the great gates of the b[road] heavens are open.”110Despite a clear distinction between gods and human beings, ac-cording to Near Eastern sources, mortals often try to overstep thedivinely imposed boundaries, and move from the natural to thesuper-natural world.111 Thus, doors, gates, or entrances to the divinespheres are often safeguarded by gatekeepers, whose main duty is toprotect this realm and prevent human intruders from trespassing. Forexample, Gilgamesh and Enkidu enter the sacred cedar forest of thegod Enlil, which is located outside the phenomenological realm. Thisforest, as the texts attests, is protected by the guardian Huwawa, whosemain duty is to keep the divine realm out of human reach. He is oftendescribed as a gigantic being, protected by layers of terrifying radi-ance, whose appearance is frightful:Huwawa whose shout is flood-weapon,whose utterance is Fire, and whose breath is Death . . .Enlil destines to keep the Pine Forest Safe,to be the terror of people.112The divine forest is prohibited to human beings and its nature isnot intended to be uncovered. People who dare to enter this out ofboundary realm endanger themselves and risk their life. Huwawa’sreaction to Gilgamesh and Enkidu’s invasion affirms this notion. Hedescribes their offensive act, which should have led to their sufferingby physical harm at the entrance to the forest:You have found out the nature of my forest,the nature [of my dwelling]. . .I should have taken you (and) slain you at theentrance to my forest’s growth.I should have given your flesh to be eatenby the fire of the forest, roaring lions,birds of prey and scavengers.113The attempt of human beings to overcome the disparity betweendivine and mortal and to exceed their reality is often depicted throughmythical themes such as confrontation with divine guards, appease-ment of protective watchmen, and public presentation of merits.Gilgamesh, in his quest for immortality, for example, encounters thedreadful guards of the mountain Mashu “whose aura is frightful, andwhose glance is death. Their terrifying mantles of radiance drape the"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"92Beholders of Divine Secretsmountain.”114 Amazed at his presence in the realm of the gods, theyinquire: “Someone has come to us . . .”115 They then find out his hu-man status, which immediately disqualified him.116 They refuse to admithim through the “great-gate” of the mountain, declaring:It is impossible, Gilgamesh,nobody has passed through the mountain’sinaccessible tract.117Etana, as well, must justify his entry at the gates of the seventhheaven. He relies on the God Ea’s plan. This enables him to answerthe two divine guards, appease them, and proceed in his quest:Ea, aware of heaven’s ways, touched himAnd [ ] made him wear his hair unkempt,[Clothed him in] mourning garb,Gave him instructions.When you go up to heaven,When you approach the gate of Anu,Dumuzi and Gizzida will be standing in the Gate of Anu,Will see you, will keep asking you questions...118A similar mythological concept is present in the story of Inanna’sDescent to the Nether World.119 Though this is a narrative of descent ratherthen ascent, the familiar element of guarded gates establish the under-world as inaccessible using a similar structural pattern. The goddessInanna must appease the gatekeeper and comply to his demands inorder to accomplish her journey and reach her sister Ereshkigal.120Heavenly gates emerge as well in various biblical texts. Jacob’sdream is an dominant example. After seeing a staircase reaching up toheaven, Jacob comes to the conclusion: “This is none other than thehouse of God and this is the gate of heaven (Gen. 28:17).121 Blockedentrances maintain the separation between the divine and human, asthe image of the cherubim, guarding the east of the Garden of Eden“with a sword flaming and turning,” demonstrates (Gen. 3:23–24).HEKHALOT AND MERKAVAH MYSTICISMThe inward progress of moving beyond human restrictions towardsan awareness of transcendent reality is often depicted in Hekhalot andMerkavah mysticism as an outward, corporeal process. Heaven’s en-trances or gates protected by fierce watchmen and terrifying divinegatekeepers, commonly manifest the inaccessible nature of divine re-ality. Such are the gates of the seventh heaven, secured by the mightyguards at the seventh palace:"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Mystical Journeys in Mythological Language93At the entrance to the seventh palace stand and rage allmighty ones, ruthless, powerful, and hard, terrible, andfrightening, higher than mountains and sharper than hills.Their bows are strung before the countenance; their swordspolished in their hands. Bolts of lightning from their eye-balls, channels of fire from their noses, and torches of coalfrom their mouths. They are adorned (with) helmets andarmors, lances and spears adorn them hanging on their arms.Their horses are horses of darkness, horses of the shadow ofdeath, horses of gloom, horses of fire, horses of blood, horsesof hail, horses of iron, horses of fog . . . And a cloud is thereover their heads, dripping blood over their heads and theheads of their horses. And this is the mark and measure-ment of the guardians at the entrance to the seventh palace,and such is the entrance of each palace.122As I. Gruenwald notes, these guards do not represent evil powers.Their main function is to prevent unqualified adepts from entering themost sacred seventh palace.123 The hero mystic who attempts to pen-etrate this realm is stopped by fearsome gatekeepers. They “fix theirgaze on him,” pose questions, and verify whether he deserves to setfoot in heaven.124 The visionary’s human essence is clearly consideredan obstacle, as Enoch-Metatron reports in 3 Enoch:“As soon as I reachedthe heavenly heights, the holy creatures . . . smelled my odor . . . theysaid, ‘What is this smell of one born of a woman?’ ”125In order to establish his claims and merits, the Merkavah adeptsare directed to exhibit specific seals to the gatekeepers at the entranceof each heaven or palace. Following this verification, the gatekeepersallow the adept to move forward and proceed into the next sphere:When you come and stand at the gate of the first palace,take two seals in your two hands. One of TWTRWSY YHWH,Lord of Israel, and one of Surya, the prince of the Presence.Show the one of TWTRWSY YHWH to those who stand onthe right, and show the one of Surya to those on the left.126The nature of the seals is not thoroughly clear, but they seem to func-tion as amulets which transcribe powerful names, letters, or magicalformulas, and are used for theurgic practices and rituals of power.127Several accounts describe an enigmatic process in which the adeptseals himself during the process of ascent.128 This use of seals can beassociated with recurring concepts found in the ancient Near Easternmythological lore. An attempt to link amulets and stones with divineinfluence is well-known in texts dating from late Assyrian times.129Different powers were ascribed to amulets which were used in certaincombinations in order to cure illness or avert impeding disaster. For"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"94Beholders of Divine Secretsexample, the Sumerian-Akkadian myth Lugal-e, still read in the lateAssyrian court, recounts how the god Ninurta defeated the stones andthen blessed or cursed them according to their nature. Zachalias ofBabylon, during the second century C.E., wrote works which ascribe tostones the ability to influence fate and the affairs of those who worethem.130 Pictorial images demonstrate as well inscriptions of formulasand names on worshipper’s bodies.131The significance of seals displayed by the descenders to theMerkavah to the guards of each heaven may be also understood in lightof the original function of the seal in the ancient Near East, and itsdepiction in narratives. Emerged as a legal mark of ownership or con-tractual obligation by an individual, it has been suggested that the sealrepresents and comprises the “essence” of a person.132 A similar concretedepiction seems to be suggested the Hekhalot and Merkavah descrip-tions. Qualified adepts who can demonstrate their merits and “essence”by showing the seals can pass unhindered and enter God’ s palaces.133TESTS AND TRIALWhen you reach the pure marble stones,do not say: Water! Water!134Misleading trials and deceptive tests are common themes in mytho-logical presentations of the hero quest. Often the hero figure is re-quired to prove his worth and aptitude by passing them successfully.In this way, he exhibits his qualification and ability to partake in di-vine worlds despite his human nature.135In the context of Mesopotamian myth, for example, Gilgamesh ischallenged to justify his adequacy for immortality by overcoming sleep,associated with the human life cycle. Not being able to resist prolongeddrowsiness, Gilgamesh fails the test by falling asleep. Thus, he displayshis human limitations in a tangible fashion, and misses the opportunityto gain eternal life and to be aligned with the gods.136 A similar test isoffered to the hero Adapa. When he enters the seventh heaven, the godAnu invites him to drink the water of life and to eat the bread of life.Being falsely informed that they entail death, Adapa refuses to acceptsuch gifts. Thus, he fails the divine test, demonstrating human, limitedperception which prevents him from realizing the true meanings of theoffer. Consequently, Adapa loses the opportunity to achieve immortality,which could have been gained by accepting the water and bread of life.137HEKHALOT AND MERKAVAH MYSTICISMAs demonstrated in chapter 2, the Hekhalot and Merkavah adepts, atthe end of their journey, transcend their human limitations and attain"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Mystical Journeys in Mythological Language95new modes of perception. They are then able to see heavenly visionsfrom a mystical perspective and recognize their hidden meanings.Before they reach this stage, however, the mystics must prevail in thecrucial “water test.”138 Every worthy adept is required to recognize themarble stones with which the palace is furnished, despite their wateryappearance.This test seems to demonstrate the spiritual stance of the mysticsnot in abstraction but in a concrete and tangible fashion. It examinestheir abilities to give up their mortal perspective in favor of a higher,divine-like perception. Only qualified individuals, who are capable ofdecoding the meaning of this manifested vision, pass the test andenter the seventh heaven.An additional entrance test, designed perhaps to determine theinner sense perception and spiritual skills of the Merkavah adepts isdepicted in a tangible manner as a corporeal process which takesplace at the entrance of the seventh heaven. A passage in HekhalotRabbatiattests:If the was qualified to descend to the Merkavah: When they[the angels] would say to him: “Enter!” he would not enter;they once again would say to him: “Enter!” and he imme-diately would enter, [then] they would praise him and say:“Surely this one is from the descenders of the Merkavah.”But if he is not qualified to descend to the Merkavah: Whenthey [the angels] would say to him: “Enter!” and he wouldimmediately enter, they would immediately throw iron cut-ters at him.139Although not all features of this test are clear, it appears that adeptsare required to resist the immediate human instincts and not to enterat once into the seventh palace. Such a response, perhaps, demon-strates a state of mind in which human senses and logic are not ofprimary importance and may be misleading. Adepts are not expectedto react in the predictable fashion, advised by their human reason,senses, and instincts. Instead they are encouraged to avoid them, todevelop an alternative response, and to demonstrate this spiritualadequacy in a concrete test.MYSTICAL-MYTHICAL TRANSFORMATIONAfter all this the Holy One, blessed be he, made for me athrone like the throne of glory, and he spread over it a cov-erlet of splendor . . . like the coverlet of the throne ofglory...He placed it at the door of the heaven and sat medown upon it.140"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"96Beholders of Divine SecretsMYTHOLOGICAL PATTERNSA pattern of transformation, found in a variety of mythical versions,introduces a change of human standing and position which often occursat the end of journeys. Several Mesopotamian mythological sourcesvisualize such a process through tangible examples and corporealimages such as passing through gates, ascending to heaven, physicalchanges of rank.In the Poem of the Righteous Sufferer, for example, a certain noble-man relates how he met with every conceivable calamity and waseventually restored to health and prosperity by the God Marduk, in-troduced as the Lord of Wisdom.141 The transformation of his position,according to the poem, materializes when he passes through severalgates and in each receives a blessing corresponding with the names ofthe gates:[In the] “Gate of Prosperity” prosperity was [given me,][In the] “Gate of the . . . Guardian Spirit”guardian spirit drew [nigh to me,][In the] “Gate of Well-being” I found well-being,In the “Gate of the Sun Rise” I was reckoned among the living,In the “Gate of Splendid Wonderment”my omens were very plain,In the “Gate of Release of Guilt”I was released from my bond,In the “Gate of Worship” my mouth inquired,In the “Gate of Resolving of Sights” my sights were resolved,In the “Gate of Pure Water”I was sprinkles with water of purification.142Another example, portraying the transformation in the context ofheavenly ascent, is the Sumero-Akkadian tradition of Enmeduranki,King of Sippar, the legendary founder of the diviner cult. This mythi-cal figure is introduced in various sources as the seventh Antediluvianking, who is brought into heaven to join the divine realm during hislifetime and is given the secrets of the Gods. One particular frag-mented cuneiform text, reconstructed and translated by W. G. Lam-bert, relates a full version of his mythical story.143 Among other notions,the account denotes a process of transformation from one mode ofstanding to another.It opens with a description of the state of primeval existence. KingEnmeduranki, mortal, is taken by the gods Shamash and Adad fromthe terrestrial realm and is brought into the celestial region. There, heis accepted to the divine assembly. His selection is justified in the textby his great love of the high gods Anu, Enlil, and Ea:144"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Mystical Journeys in Mythological Language97Shamash in Ebabbarra [appointed]Enmeduranki [king of Sippar],the beloved of Anu, Enlil [and Ea].Shamash and Adad [brought him in] totheir assembly.145In heaven Enmeduranki undergoes an elaborate process of externaltransformation. The gods honor him, grant him a golden throne, andput in his hand the cedar rod, an emblem of power and authority. Thegods give Enmeduranki, the “tablet of the gods” which, according toMesopotamian mythological tradition, contains the decrees, destinies,and norms which constitute all aspects and functions of life, past, present,and future.146 The “tablet of the gods” or the “tablet of Destinies” isconsidered to be a central emblem of authority and the means by whichsupreme power is granted to its keeper. Enmeduranki also receives thedivine mysteries, which the gods reveal to him. These include divinatorytechniques essentially related to the act of observation:Shamash and Adad [honoured him],Shamash and Adad [set him] on a largethrone of gold. They showed himhow to observe oil on water,a mystery of Anu [Enlil and Ea].They gave him the tablet of the gods, theliver, a secret of heaven and [underworld].They put in his hand the cedar- (rod), beloved of the great gods.147This transformation involves changes which serve to markEnmedranki’s new identity, position, power, and responsibility.Enmeduranki is taken to heaven and is assigned a role and place inthe celestial realm. Equipped with divine knowledge, Enmedurankigains access to the mysteries of the gods. He is able to observe mani-fested signs, see hidden meanings ordinarily concealed from mortaleyes, and behold veiled occurrences beyond time and place.It is important to note, at this point, that Enmeduranki is consid-ered to be the founder of the ba ̄rû cult. The term is derived from theAkkadian verb “ba ̄rû,” which literally means “to see,” “to observe,” or“to watch.”148 The tradition asserts that under specific circumstances,the gods reveal the future to human beings through manifested signs.The qualified ba ̄rû (literally “the one who sees,” or “the one whoobserves”), versed in the mysteries of the gods, is able to see thedivine signs, decipher their concealed significance, and subsequentlydisclose them to humankind.149After this transformation, the account presents Enmeduranki asan official power in Heaven and the guardian of divine mysteries. He"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"98Beholders of Divine Secretssits above on a golden throne alongside the gods, welcomes peoplewho ascend to heaven, directs them, and reveals the celestial secretsto them. It is important to notice that Enmeduranki is not an indepen-dent divine power. Even after his radical transformation, Enmedurankiacts on behalf of the gods and in accordance with their will. His mainresponsibility, it seems, is to decode veiled secrets by divinatory tech-niques and to mediate between the divine and human worlds. Hisdescendants, the barus, “observers,” share this mediatory role. Thesespecialists, as scholars have noted, rigorously trained and then initi-ated into the secrets of their art. Their main role is to observe the signsof the gods, understand them, decipher their hidden meaning, andthen reveal it to humankind:Then he, in accordance with their [wor(?)] broughtthe men of Nippur, Sippar andBabylon into his presence,and he honored them. He set them on thrones before [him].He showed them how to observe oilon water, a mystery of Anu,Enlil and Ea;he gave them the tablet of thegods, the liver, a secret ofheaven and underworld;he put in their hands the cedar(rod), beloved of the great gods.150The Mesopotamian mythological model presents King Enmeduranki’stransformation from an earthly man to a heavenly being who caninterpret divine secrets encoded in signs. Several key themes structurethe metamorphosis in a concrete manner: (1.) The beloved king ischosen by the gods to be taken to heaven; (2.) in heaven, he receivesfrom the gods divine emblems of status and power, which demon-strate his new position as a member of the celestial assembly; (3.) KingEnmeduranki is granted divine knowledge and learns the secrets ofthe gods. These include the art of divination through techniques ofseeing signs, observing them correctly, and understanding their hid-den meaning. It is important to note that Enmeduranki’s knowledgeof divination and his ability to discern the meaning of divine secretsare granted, directed, and dependent on the gods; and (4.) as a re-ceiver of divine mysteries, King Enmeduranki becomes a mediatorbetween Heaven and Earth and a model for members of the ba ̄rû cult.The influence of this Mesopotamian tradition on the Enochic tra-ditions, from Genesis through to the Jewish Apocalyptic writings, haslong been demonstrated in significant studies.151 Already during thetime of the authorship of the Genesis Priestly source, the figure of"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Mystical Journeys in Mythological Language99Enoch existed as a Jewish counterpart to heroic figures of Mesopo-tamian myth such as the flood hero Utnapishtim, Gilgamesh, Utuabzu,and king Enmeduranki. In the context of this discussion, we will notconcentrate on the correspondence between these figures and themanner in which traditions have been transmitted and evolved, butrather on the Mesopotamian model of transformation and its latermystical utilization in the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature.HEKHALOT AND MERKAVAH MYSTICISMAs noted earlier, several Hekhalot and Merkavah accounts denote ashift from conventional to mystical awareness in terms of inner spiri-tual and conceptual process, which leads to a perception of transcen-dent reality. Stages of such inner transformation are discerned inconcrete metaphors, pictorial images, and mythological patterns ofexpressions which correspond to both sources mentioned above, thePoem of the Righteous Sufferer and the Enmeduranki narrative.3 Enoch, which follows the transformation of the human Enoch toMetatron, the Prince of the Countenance, will be our focus. The ac-count first describes how Enoch is chosen by God to ascend to heaven.God selects him, separates him from his human generation, and takeshim up to heaven to the higher celestial divine palace. God’s love forEnoch is one reason for his elevation:Out of the abundant love and great compassion where withthe Holy One, blessed be he, loved and cherished me morethan all the denizens of the heights.152In Heaven, Enoch’s metamorphosis becomes apparent first as an ex-ternal physical transformation. Enoch is enlarged, sheds his humanform and becomes an enormous winged glowing figure. He is alsogranted a place in the celestial hierarchy. Several concrete emblemsmark his elevated position and status: a majestic robe, a kingly crown,an aurora of brilliance and a heavenly throne, similar to the throne ofglory. God places this throne at the door of the seventh palace and sitsEnoch down upon it:After all this the Holy One, blessed be he, made for me athrone like the throne of glory, and he spread over it a cov-erlet of splendor . . . like the coverlet of the throne ofglory.. . . He placed it at the door of the seventh heaven andsat me down upon it. And his herald went out into everyheaven and announced concerning me: “I have appointedMetatron my servant as a prince and a ruler over all thedenizens of the heights.. . . Whatever he says to you in myname you must observe and do.”153"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"100Beholders of Divine SecretsEnoch is also granted a profound wisdom, knowledge, divineunderstanding, and other attributes, which enable him to extend hisperception beyond human limitations. This transformation material-izes when heavenly gates are opened for him, each containing a cer-tain blessing :Before the Holy One, blessed be he, set me to serve thethrone of glory, he opened for me 300,000 gates of under-standing, 300,000 gates of prudence, 300,000 gates of life,300,000 gates of grace and favor, 300,000 gates of love,300,000 gates of Torah, 300,000 gates of humility, 300,000gates of substance, 300,000 gates of mercy, 300,000 gates ofreverence. . . .154Moreover, Enoch-Metatron receives the pargod, ( ) or heavenlycurtain. In this context it seems that the pargod of Enoch and the heav-enly tablet of Enmeduranki function in a similar manner. The courseof human history, its norms, its past, present, and future are all en-graved upon the surface.155. . . the curtain of the Omnipresent, which is spread beforethe Holy One, blessed be he, and on which are printed allthe generations of the world, and all their deeds whetherdone or to be done, till the last generation.176Enoch learns the secrets of God and understands their hiddenmeaning. Here we can note a significant development in theMesopotamia mythological pattern. Enoch-Metatron does not receivemethods of divination. Instead, God grants him divine wisdom whichenables him to understand and interpret all mysteries. Subsequently,he is qualified to comprehend hidden levels of reality from a divineperspective. Enoch looks beyond time and space, beholds profoundvisions which no human has ever seen, and unravels the meaning ofenigmatic mysteries above and below:The Holy One, blessed be he, revealed to me from that timeonward all the mysteries of wisdom, all the depths of theperfect Torah and all the thoughts of men’s hearts. All mys-teries of the world and all the orders of nature stand revealedbefore me as they stand revealed before the creator. From thattime onward I looked and beheld deep secrets and wonderfulmysteries, Before a man thinks in secret, I see his thought;before he acts, I see his act. There is nothing in heaven aboveor deep within the earth concealed from me.157Following the metamorphosis, Enoch becomes a mighty, awesomecelestial being, Metatron, the Prince of the Countenance. His form,"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Mystical Journeys in Mythological Language101position, and inner perception are semidivine. Enoch-Metatron becomesthe bearer of divine wisdom and thus comprehends both revealed andconcealed levels of reality. In this status, he sits on a heavenly throne,and judges the heavenly dwellers:At first I sat upon a great throne at the door of the seventhpalace, and I judged all the denizens of the heights on theauthority of the Holy One, blessed be he.158Enoch-Metatron welcomes the Merkavah seekers who ascend to heaven,such as Rabbi Ishmael, and the “Other” Aher, “who came to beholdthe vision of the chariot.” Misled by the dramatic transformation ofEnoch, Aher wrongly concludes: “There are indeed two powers inheaven.”159 In this way, he fails to understand that Enoch-Metatron isnot an independent divine power, but rather an agent directed byGod. In his new position, Enoch-Metatron acts not only as a guide anda mediator to the ascenders to the chariot, but also reveals celestialmysteries and future events to them, in a process perhaps analogousto King Enmeduranki’s patronage of the ba ̄rû cult. For example, afterhe shows Rabbi Ishmael all the heavenly sites, archives, and secrets,he discloses to him the heavenly tablets and explains in detail how toread, understand, and behold their secrets:Metatron said to me: “Come and I will show you the curtainof the Omnipresent which is spread before the Holy One,blessed be he.” . . . I went and he showed them to me withhis finger, like a father teaching his sons the letters of theTorah.160In this way, Enoch-Metatron’s role as a link between humanity andGod becomes clear. He mediates between the two realms, explainsGod’s secrets, deciphers their hidden meanings, and reveals them toother accomplished members of the Merkavah circle.We can conclude, it seems, that Enoch’s transformation from ahuman being to the divine power Metatron, is depicted in 3 Enoch byevoking and appropriating a mythological model drawn from theMesopotamian tradition. Many themes related to Enmeduranki’s trans-formation in a mythological context, present Enoch’s essentially mys-tical metamorphosis. His human status is elevated by the divine, andhe is able to join the celestial sphere as an angelic being seated on aheavenly throne. He receives heavenly emblems of power and author-ity which manifest his elevated status. He undergoes an external physi-cal transformation, which coincides with an ability to discern the hiddenmeaning of visions. Enoch-Metatron’s ability to decode divine myster-ies corresponds to the ancient mythological pattern. Unlike the"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"102Beholders of Divine SecretsMesopotamian mythological king, however, he does not relay ondivinatory methods but is inspired by divine wisdom.As we have seen, the ancient mythological pattern of transforma-tion which leads to attainment of divine mysteries resurfaces andacquires new implications in 3 Enoch. Other Hekhalot and Merkavahaccounts do not display such an explicit affinity with the ancientmythical model, but can be said to be structured in a similar pattern.In its original mythological setting the mythological model of transfor-mation enables a human being, King Enmeduranki, to attain mysteriesof the gods through methods of divination.In3 Enoch, Enoch-Metatron experiences a transformation whichentails the attainment of divine wisdom. In other passages of Hekhalotmysticism, a process of transformation results in the ability to beholdand interpret divine mysteries and revelations, as we have seen inchapter 2. The mythological pattern of transformation is part of themystical context. Cultivated and achieved through inner experiencesand spiritual development, a transformation in awareness and con-sciousness enables the adepts of the Merkavah to behold meanings ofdivine secrets as their human perception matches that of the divine.Accomplished visionaries are depicted as sitting in heaven. They areplaced in front of the throne of God, a position which demonstratestheir new spiritual status and abilities, gaze at the Merkavah, andbehold the King’s beauty:. . . the Ophannim of might embrace him, the Cherubim ofmajesty kiss him, the living creatures raise him up, themorning star dances before him, and the Hashmal singsbefore him, and the wind of living splendor raises him up,until they lift him up and set him down before the throne ofglory; And he beholds and sees the king at his beauty . . .161Following this stage the mystics descend to the human realm to givetestimony of revelations and visions before all members of their mys-tical circle. In this way, they bridge Heaven and Earth in a very similarway to both Enmeduranki and Enoch.CONCLUSIONThis chapter examined how the spiritual journey is articulated in sev-eral Hekhalot and Merkavah literary traditions. Three main aspectswere treated: the image of the Hekhalot “ideal mystic,” the voyage,and the transformation at its end. As the discussion demonstrated,these aspects of the spiritual-conceptual path are often stated using amythological language involving pictorial images, concrete metaphors,"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Mystical Journeys in Mythological Language103and figurative expressions, as well as themes and patterns rooted inMesopotamian and biblical mythology.An indirect exegetical dimension is also of great significance inthis presentation. Mythological images in Hekhalot and Merkavahmysticism are not elucidated by midrashic or philosophical methods,nor are they deciphered in the symbolic manner, frequently used inlater kabbalistic texts. Instead, the new context seem to infuse ancientmythological themes with new meanings and with alternative conno-tations so that, effectively, they come to express mystical content.Embedded in the Hekhalot and Merkavah mystical imagination aremythological images and specific themes rooted in historical-textualtraditions and sources. These elements resurface in a different settingto present new spiritual notions in the Judaism of late antiquity. Theyoffer eloquent expressions of a spiritual-contemplative process of cross-ing conceptual boundaries. They convey a mystical, inner reality asthey describe the visionaries’ stages of mental-spiritual progress andawareness. It appears, thus, that collective, ancient mythological themesand patterns of expression are remodeled and reapplied in Hekhalotand Merkavah mysticism to give expression to subjective, mysticalnotions which by their nature, perhaps, stand beyond clear verbalexpression and familiar vocabulary."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"1055The Concept of God:Mystical and Mythological DimensionsINTRODUCTIONAbstract images of spirit and soul are employed to express the essenceof God in Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism. Many statements, like-wise, convey God’s inconceivable and sublime nature, beyond humanor angelic perception. Other descriptions, in sharp contrast, denote thedivine in figurative, tangible, and corporeal images. God is portrayedas an anthropomorphic mighty king. Draped in regal garments, wear-ing a royal crown, God sits on a lofty throne in the celestial realm,holding the signet ring of Heaven and Earth in his hand. Hismagnificent palaces, majestic thrones, and royal chariots substantiatehis greatness and affirm his supremacy. Huge in body and size, beam-ing with radiance, glory, and beauty, God reigns from above whileother divine beings praise him, exalt his name and, in unison, accepthis absolute authority. These two conflicting images of God, the ab-stract and the concrete, are already evident in the biblical and midrashictraditions.1 In Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism we find them inte-grated in a mystical context and reconciled by spiritual exegesis.This complex presentation of God, both abstract and concrete, is thefocus of this chapter. It suggests that the tangible depiction of a figurativeGod is not in conflict with an abstract conception of a transcendent, spiri-tual deity. Rather, the concrete portrayal expresses the concept of God ina mythological fashion through pictorial images and visual language. Inaddition, specific Near Eastern mythological patterns and imagery, rootedin biblical and Mesopotamian traditions, are reintegrated in various de-scriptions in order to convey God’s absolute mastery and his infinitenature. These include, for example, enormous physical size, exclusivekingship, majestic appearance, and tangible supremacy."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"106Beholders of Divine SecretsThis concrete depiction of God is incorporated into the mysticalcontext of the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature and seems to be in-terpreted through a mystical-exegetical lens. Those Merkavah adeptswho come to possess an ability to behold divine visions with an “un-derstanding of the heart” can look at manifestations of God’s tangiblekingdom and his anthropomorphic image and recognize God’s spiri-tual powers and true essence of soul and spirit. Thus, I will suggestthat the two seemingly conflicting descriptions of God, the abstractand concrete, appear to be complementary from the exegetical per-spective of the Hekhalot and Merkavah mystics.This chapter will examine these topics in further detail. It willdemonstrate the manner in which the concept of God is asserted byevoking both mythological forms of expression as well as specificthemes rooted in biblical and Mesopotamian traditions. The discus-sion will be divided into three sections. The first will examine descrip-tive illustrations of God’s kingship. The second will analyze manifestedfigurative images of God. The third will demonstrate how such repre-sentations are decoded by mystical exegesis.MYSTICAL-MYTHICAL KINGDOMWho is like you in heaven and on earth?Holy in heaven and holy on earth.He is a holy King, he is a blessed King,He is a mighty King over the entire Merkavah.2Distinct views, present particularly in Deuteronomistic and priestlysources of the Hebrew bible, negate a figurative conception of YHWH,emphasizing instead the divine’s transcendence and his verbal, audi-tory manifestation. These sources reflect a tendency to shun any kindof personal or anthopomorphic language when referring to God. Theyalso disassociate him from specific cultic locations, and refrain frommentioning any relationship of possession between God and his dwell-ing place.3 An avoidance of such mythic imagery is not, however, asole characteristic of the biblical corpus. Concrete, corporeal concep-tions of God are introduced in a variety of biblical traditions. Non andpre-Deuteronomistic sources, as well as later works including pro-phetic and post exilic, priestly traditions, evidently utilize figurative,tangible language and imagery in their depictions of God.4It is such mythic depictions which are often selected and appliedin Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism, and are evident in many of itsnarrations. Mythological forms of expression were accepted, it seems,as valid ways of articulating its concept of the divine. Thus we see that"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"The Concept of God: Mystical and Mythological Dimensions107in Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism a dominant concept of God isthat of a mighty, anthropomorphic king.5 Moreover, the notions of hiskingship is not conceived as an abstract metaphor or as a symbolicconcept. Instead, it is presented as a concrete reality manifested inseveral primary ways. God truly resides in heaven, many accountsaffirm. His illustrious palaces, awesome thrones, royal chariots, exten-sive royal court, and absolute authority over other divine powers,make evident his greatness and affirm his supremacy in a visible,tangible fashion. Following are examples of such representations.PALACES AND ROYAL COURTIn seven places TWTRWSYY YHWH, God of Israel, dwellschamber within chamber, and at the gate of each palaceare eight doorkeepers, four at the right of the lintel,and four at the left of the lintel.6MYTHOLOGICAL PATTERNSA common mythological convention of the Mesopotamian and relatedtraditions is the use of metaphors of human kingship to denote notionsof authority and superiority.7 Divine qualities of transcendence andsupremacy are often expressed by images of the gods as lofty, cosmickings. These images emphasize their exalted position and might in thesuper terrestrial regions of the cosmos. The gods reign from on high.They reside in heaven in celestial palaces, characterized in several ways.The heavenly palaces confirm the supremacy of the high God.8 Theyare not conceived as earthly temples, built by human beings as placesof worship, but rather as structures designed to function as dwellingsfor the gods. Textual details in various sources often emphasize theseaspects. For example, in the fifth tablet of Enumah Elish, the god Mardukrefers to the private quarters of his abode as he plans to build his temple.He also speaks of this temple as a tangible verification of his powers:I shall make a house to be a luxurious dwelling for myself,And I shall found my cult centre within it,And I shall establish my private quarters and confirm my kingship.9Similarly, the goddess Ishtar ’s palace is asserted as her private abode,as Etana and the eagle discover when they reach her heavenly house:I saw a house with a window that [had no] seal.I . . . went inside.Sitting therein was a [young woman];She had the dignity of a crown, and was fair of countenance.A throne had been set for her and the ground around it"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"108Beholders of Divine Secretshad been trodden down.For at the base of the throne [fierce] lions were ly[ing]. 10A parallel mythic conception of palaces is prominent in Ugariticmythology. The palace of Baal, for instance manifests his hierarchicalposition. The god El’s palace is depicted as a seven-room house inwhich he hides from the furious goddess Anat.11Palaces of the gods are often situated at the heavenly end of thecosmic pole.12 They are frequently considered as archetypal modelsfor earthly temples. For example, Gudea, the king of the city ofLagash, builds his earthly temple in accordance with “the holy stars”or “the heavenly plan” revealed to him by the god Ningirsu.13 Ce-lestial palaces are also perceived as situated parallel to temples onEarth. Descriptions in Enumah Elish illustrate this connection, de-picting the earthly temple in Babylon as parallel to the heavenlypalace,Esharra.14An elaborate administrative system serves the high god in hispalace and manages his affairs. A divine staff is responsible forvarious chores, duties, and rituals.15 In addition, various cosmicand natural aspects as well as abstract moral concepts arepersonified. They are represented by minor divine beings cast asGod’s helpers in the celestial realm. For example, in Mesopotamianmythology the god Ishkur (Adad) embodies the power of storms.The god Gibil (Girra) represents fire in all its aspects. The godNannna is the moon god. The god Utu personifies the power ofRighteousness and Justice.16 In Canaanite myths, in a similar way,abstract notions such as Holiness (qds), Justice (msr), and Righteous-ness (sdq), are represented by specific deities.17In biblical sources Yahweh is often viewed as a mighty king, rul-ing over the cosmos from his palace.18 These sources also reveal vari-ous details concerning God’s palace, delineated as both his heavenlydwelling and a manifestation of his powers. The principal Hebrewterm for Yahweh’s residence is palace (hekhal, ).19The term is usedto denote both a human-king’s royal residence (e.g., 1 Kings 21:1; 2Kings 20:18, 39:7), and Yahweh’s residence (e.g., Mic. 1:2; Hab. 2:20;Ps. 11:4, 18:7; 36:9). In his examination of temple and community inancient Israel, M. Haran thus affirms:Just as every temporal king, and indeed any man, has hisown domicile, so the divine king, in whose shadow thecommunity finds protection, has a residence of his own. Andin this dwelling place, just as in every luxurious house, themaster of the residence is provided with all his “needs.”...Inthis dwelling place, moreover, the master of the residence"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"The Concept of God: Mystical and Mythological Dimensions109has his own servants, the priests, who care for his necessi-ties and keep the house in order—just as any reigningmonarch has his palace servants and retinue surroundinghim constantly and performing his order.20Connection between the temple as Yahweh’s earthly dwelling andthe heaven as his celestial abode are evident in postexilic sources, suchas psalm 48, which discerns Mount Zion as an axis mundi and God’stemple as situated on its top.21 Aspects of God’s royalty are oftenassociated with a divine court, administrative royal bureaucracy, di-vine attendants, and officials: “divine assembly,” “assembly of holybeings,” “council,” “assembly,” “hosts,” “servants,” “attendants” areseveral applications of such designations.22HEKHALOT AND MERKAVAH MYSTICISMGod’s heavenly palaces (Hekhalot,) are associated with themystical conception of God and the divine sphere.23In many accounts,however, these palaces are also envisioned as concrete structures situ-ated in a mythological realm in which God, the king, resides. Follow-ing mythological patterns of expression, God’s royal palaces attest tohis high position, kingship, and supremacy. They are depicted as heav-enly abodes, or as “princely households,” which contain rooms, door-ways, thresholds, archives, and courts:24In seven palaces TWTRWSYY YHWY, God of Israel, dwellschamber within chamber, and at the gate of each palace areeight doorkeepers, four at the right of the lintel, and four atthe left of the lintel.25Various accounts of God’s realm reintroduce themes fromEzekiel’s throne vision. Yet, in contrast to descriptions in Ezekiel, inwhich the divine is perceived in an open cosmic setting, God inHekhalot and Merkavah mysticism is often enclosed in a celestialresidential palace which contains rooms, closed doors, and courts asRabbi Ishmael attests:When I ascended to the height to behold the vision of thechariot, I entered six palaces, one inside the other, and whenI reached the door of the seventh palace, I paused in prayerbefore the Holy One, blessed be he.26Other references to doorways and entrances of God’s various quartersare mentioned. In Hekhalot Rabbati, for example, the angel Anafi’el“keeps the keys of the palaces of the heaven of Aravot.” His respon-sibility as a doorkeeper is described as well:"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"110Beholders of Divine Secrets. . . when a man wishes to descend to the Merkavah, theangel Anafi’el opens the doors of the entrance to the sev-enth heaven and that man enters and stands at the thresh-old of the entrance to the seventh heaven. . . .27The angel Dumi’el, similarly, is depicted as posted at the right sideof the entrance to the sixth palace. A passage in the Genizah,likewise,speaks of God’s palace in which he hides in inner rooms.28Other features demonstrate further correspondence between de-scriptions in Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism and conventionalpatterns rooted in Near Eastern mythology. The seventh palace of Godis situated at the heavenly end of the cosmic pole. Thus, we hear of“the heavenly ladder with its one end on earth and one end on theright foot of the throne of glory.”29 God’s heavenly palace in the sev-enth heaven, raqiaseems to be a model for the earthly temple whichis placed parallel to it:Raise your eyes to heaven opposite your house of prayerin the hour when you say before me: “holy.” Teach them:I have no joy in all my world that I created but whenyour eyes are raised to my eyes and my eyes are raised toyour eyes.30An administrative system is also part of the royal celestial court.Official, divine powers organize the palace’s daily functions and ac-tivities. These include, for example, gatekeepers, “serving angels,”“angels of revelations,” the Ophanim, Cherubim, Seraphim, Galgalim,and other groups.31 The palace routine is detailed. Every day God sitson the throne of judgment in the celestial law court.32 Three times aday God descends from the eighth heaven to the seventh heaven wherehis throne is located.33 Every day, when dawn approaches, God blessesthe living creatures.34 We find detailed reports of other activities insidethe palace, conducted by divine workers. Angels are in charge ofheavenly archives and their scrolls. One such angel is Radweri’el, who“takes out the scroll box, in which the book of records is kept . . . breaksthe seals of the scroll box, opens it, takes out the scrolls and puts themin the hand of the Holy One.”35 Serving angels make crowns of life,setting precious stones and pearls into them, while others mix all kindsof perfumes and prepare wine, spices, and fragrances for righteouspeople in future days.36Aspects of nature are personified and associated with the domina-tion of angelic masters:These are the names of the princes who guide the world:Gabri’el, the angel of fire; Baradi’el, the angel of hail; Ruhi’el,"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"The Concept of God: Mystical and Mythological Dimensions111who is in charge of wind; Baraqi’el, who is in charge forlightning; Zaami’el, who is in charge of whirlwind; Ziqi’el,who is in charge of comets; Zi’iel, who is in charge of trem-ors; Zaapi’el, who is in charge of hurricane; Raami’el, whois in charge of thunder; Raasi’el, who is in charge of earth-quakes, Salgi’el, who is in charge of snow; Matari’el, who isin charge of rain; Simsi’el, who is in charge of day; Laili’el,who is in charge of night; Galgalli’el, who is in charge of theorb of the sun; Opanni’el, who is in charge of the disk of themoon; Kokabi’el who is in charge of the stars; Rahati’el,who is in charge of the constellations.37God’s courtroom is represented as concrete. Likewise, abstractconcepts, such as Justice, Mercy, and Truth are personified as autono-mous divine figures, who act as God’s assistants. His servants Jus-tice, Mercy, and Truth, thus, stand beside him as attendants in thecelestial court:When the Holy One, blessed be He,sits on the throne of judgment,Justice stands on his right hand, Mercy on his left,and Truth stands directly facing him.38These concrete heavenly palaces and the active royal householddo not appear to be presented as symbolic images. Instead, they areintroduced as part of the Hekhalot and Merkavah mystical reality,which can be witnessed and explored by human observers. The de-scenders to the chariot enter doors of the palaces, step into divinequarters, and behold YHWH, God of Israel who dwells inside. RabbiAkiva and Rabbi Ishmael are prime examples. Rabbi Ishmael’s at-tests: “I saw the King of the Kings sitting on a high and exaltedthrone, and his servants were attending Him on His right and on Hisleft.”39Rabbi Akiva attests: “. . . when I went and asked this questionbefore the throne of glory, I saw Him, YHWH, God of Israel. “40In various religious-mystical writings mystical experiences are oftencharacterized as experiences of a “different reality,” in R. Otto’s words,which is distinct in essence from the mundane, phenomenologicalreality of everyday life.41 In Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism, sucha conceptual “different reality” assumes tangible form and visiblesubstance. Wondrous divine beings with numerous eyes, fantasticwinged creatures, and radiant sacred beasts with human, lion, bull,and eagle faces, populate the heavenly domain roaming around thecelestial upper court.42 Some of these images are inspired by Ezekiel’sthrone vision, which derived several of its images from Mesopotamiantradition, as scholars have long demonstrated.43 Hekhalot and"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"112Beholders of Divine SecretsMerkavah accounts, in turn, both revive and reintegrate such imagesinto their mystical context. The mythical beasts appear to be animatedin the mind of the visionaries as visible aspects of the mystical “dif-ferent reality.” Adepts who reach God’s heavenly household, encoun-ter these creatures as part of their experience:Rabbi Akiva said: “when I ascended and gazed upon God,I saw all the creatures that are in the roadways of heaven,their length above and their width below,their width below and their length above.”44THRONES. . . because upon a high and exhaulted, frightful and terriblethrone do you reside in the chambers of the lofty palace.45MYTHOLOGICAL PATTERNSThe throne itself is another concrete, visible manifestation of divinestatus and authority in Mesopotamian mythological traditions. ASumerian hymn to the god Enlil elucidates this notion, making evi-dent the link between the god’s throne and his sovereign power:Enlil, whose command is far reaching,Lofty his word (and) holy. . . .When father Enlil seats himself broadly on the holy dais,on the lofty dais,When Nunammir carries out to supreme perfectionlordship and kingship.The earth-gods bow down willingly before him.The annuna humble themselves before him.46Thrones are often conceived as charged with the power of divinekingship.47 An Ugaritic text, thus, describes how both “Divine Thrones”and “Divine Seats” receive various forms of cultic devotion.48 As prin-cipal personifications of divine essence, thrones are often depicted assurrounded with a glorious aura of light and brightness.49 Referencesto empty thrones representing divinity appear also in several accounts.These thrones are set up for the gods, as visible symbols of authority,so that they may sit on them when circumstances allow.The iconography of the ancient Near East parallels these literaryreferences, as scholars have noted. Empty thrones appear inMesopotamian iconography from the period before the Iron Age. T. N.D. Mettinger has denoted a pictorial image of such a throne on anAssyrian cylinder seal from the eleventh and twelfth centuries B.C.E.50Similar images are also found in later periods. A series of representa-"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"The Concept of God: Mystical and Mythological Dimensions113tions of winged empty thrones, known as the “sphinx thrones,” areanother example of this image. An ivory model of a winged thronefrom the Late Bronze Age was found in Megiddo. Its outer wings canbe clearly seen; the inner wings seem to be located under the throne.51Sphinx thrones were found as well around Sidon, Tyre, Syria Larissa,and Beth-Shean. As scholars have observed, in several cases thronesthemselves were objects of adoration and worship.52 Several sourcesmention the position of “throne-bearer” assigned to a divine being whoseduty was to serve the throne. For example, Sumerian sources speak ofthe god Igalima, the throne-bearer of the god Ningirsu.53 The impor-tance of occupying a throne, as a symbol of kingship and order, isapparent in several sources such as the standard Babylonian version oftheAnzumyth. In this account the rebel-figure Anzu is able to takecontrol of the god Enlil’s power and sovereign position because Enlil,temporarily, left his throne empty and unprotected.54An additional attribute occasionally associated with divine thronesin Mesopotamian mythology is their mobile quality. In a hymn to thegod Enlil, his throne is imagined as a dynamic object hovering inheaven:Enlil . . .Made permanent his great princeship;Places the crown upon his holy locks.He sets up his dais in the mountain mist.He rotates it in heaven like a rainbow,He makes it roam about like a floating cloud.55Biblical accounts often proclaim the throne of God as representinghis kingship, as many examples attest.56 The prophet Micaiah ben-Imlahtestifies: “I saw the Lord sitting on his throne with all the host of heavenstanding beside him” (I Kings 22:19). Daniel sees thrones that were setin place and the Ancient One on his fiery throne (Daniel 7: 9–10). Theprophet Ezekiel describes: “. . . something like a throne in appearancelike sapphire” (Ezekiel 1: 26; 10: 1). Various psalms express a similarconception of thrones, the manifestation of God’s kingship, as psalm104:19, for example, suggests: “The Lord has established his throne inthe heavens.” In a similar manner, the throne functions as a concretesymbol of kingship and divine order after God’s victory over the forcesof chaos, as, for example, in Psalm 93: “The Lord is King . . . he hasestablished the world; it shall never be moved; your throne is estab-lished from the old; you are from everlasting” (1–2).Of importance, too, is the empty cherubim-throne in the cult ofthe First Temple in Jerusalem (1 Kings 6: 23–28).57 Mettinger has clearly"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"114Beholders of Divine Secretsdemonstrated the role of the cherubim-throne in the cult of YahwehSabaoth in Solomon’s temple. As he has shown, the cherubim-throneembodied the conception of kingship, in a fashion parallel to the NearEastern model. On it God was invisibly enthroned as a king, as hisdivine epithet, “he who is enthroned upon the cherubim”( ), affirms. This empty throne, above the Ark, has beencharacterized by Mettinger as an example of “sacred emptiness” sinceit generates in the onlooker the mental image of a deity as a king onhis throne.58HEKHALOT AND MERKAVAH MYSTICISMA mythological treatment of the throne is notable in Hekhalot andMerkavah mysticism. The “throne” ( ), is often conceived asa concrete image of absolute power and authority. It proves and dem-onstrates God’s sovereignty, as the following wording from HekhalotRabbati indicates:. . . because upon a high and exhaulted, frightful and ter-rible throne do you reside in the chambers of the loftypalace.59God’s throne, a visible sign of divine power, is in many casespersonified and functions almost as an independent being. At times italso receives some form of cultic devotion, which is set apart from thatof God. Praise and hymns are presented directly to the throne. Thus,we read in Hekhalot Rabbati:Sing, sing exalted seat! Shout, shout for joy, precious vesselwhich was made with wonderful wonder. Gladden, the kingwho is on you . . .60Similar to images of the dynamic or winged thrones from ancientNear Eastern sources, the throne in Hekhalot and Merkavah mysti-cism is also a mobile object, hovering in heaven:Your throne hovers since the hour when you inserted thepeg of the weaving of the web, on which the completion ofthe world and its exhaltation stand, many years, genera-tions without end. And he still does not rest his feet uponthe ground of the Aravot heaven but like a hovering bird,he stands underneath you.61The throne is set up for God, and, as a personified object, it invites himto sit down upon it. Thus, God’s supremacy is again substantiated ina concrete fashion by an icon of his throne, available at all time:And three times daily, the throne of glory prostrates itselfand say to you: “ZHRRY’L, YHWH, God of Israel, be honored"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"The Concept of God: Mystical and Mythological Dimensions115and sit down upon me, glorious King,as your burden is pleasant for me and not heavy.”62An important task of some angels is the bearing of the throne, P.Schäfer has noted.63 These angels are often addressed as the “bearers,”or the servants of the throne and “[all of them] stand crowned underthe throne of glory.” They lift it high, “with powerful, strength andmight.”64 The animated throne, as well, joins the angels in their praisesand exaltations and its hymn is the climax of the heavenly songs ofglorification:. . . like the singing voice of the throne of glory,which mentions and exalts the glorious King,abandance of voices and much great uproar,and many voices were helping him, the throne of glory,to assist him, to strengthen him, when he sings and praisesHim, the Mighty One of Jacob,as is written: “Holy, holy, holy” (Isaiah 6:3)65God in several descriptions recognizes the magnitude of occupyinghis throne. He pledges not to leave it and vows by “the throne of mysplendor, which consists of my honor, which I have not left since itwas created, and [I] will not leave in eternity.”66CHARIOTSWhen He rides upon a swift cherub,between placing one foot on its back andplacing the other foot on it,He perceives 18,000 worlds at a glance;He discerns and sees into all of them.67MYTHICAL PATTERNSIn written texts as well as in iconographical sources from the ancientNear East, gods and goddesses are often visualized as riding chari-ots as they travel. They ride over land and sea in their chariots,which often have meteorological associations, such as clouds, storms,and winds.68 According to a seventh-century B.C.E. document, thegod Utu is thought to ride his chariot across the sky by day, andthrough the “interior of heaven” by night.69 In a hymn to the godIskur, he is illustrated as the “lord who rides the storm.” The godAdad is known by the title “rider of clouds.” In one of the later textsofAtrahasis, the Babylonian flood story, the god Adad rides on thefour winds as the flood approachs.70 In Ugarit sources, the god Baalis often entitled “the rider of the clouds.” He is described as ridingon a winged chariot.71"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"116Beholders of Divine SecretsBiblical traditions often refer to corresponding images such aswinds, cherubs, clouds, and chariots in their depiction of the ridingGod.72 Psalm 68: 5, for example, introduces Yahweh, the “rider overthe steppes” ( ). Psalm 18: 11 portrays Yahweh riding on thewind, an image which appears again in depictions of divine chariotsin Ezekiel 1: 10 as well as in Psalm 65:12. Similarly, Psalm 18:10affirms: “He rode upon a cherub () and flew. He sped upon thewings of the wind” ( ). The notion of God riding a chariot isclearly depicted in Habakkuk 3: 8 and 15 ().HEKHALOT AND MERKAVAH MYSTICISMHekhalot and Merkavah mysticism associates the term “chariot”( ) with a mystical concept of the divine sphere.83 Several descrip-tions, nonetheless, embrace mythological images of chariots, presentedas vehicles in which God rides as he travels the cosmos. In varioustexts, God’s concrete chariots are mentioned and identified. One ex-ample is found in 3 Enoch:How many chariots has the Holy One, blessed be he?He has the chariot of the cherubim. . . .He has the chariot of the wind . . .He has the chariot of the clouds. . . .74Another account in 3 Enoch reports in detail the act of riding the chariot:God mounts the chariot, places his two feet on it, one after the other,and rides in heaven while glancing at his kingdom:When He rides upon a swift cherub, between placing onefoot on its back, and placing the other foot on it, he per-ceives 18,000 worlds at a glance; he discerns and sees intoall of them.75References to Rikbi’el (), the angel in charge of God’s chariot,attest the tangible perception of God’s chariots as instrument of trans-portation. These references give an explanation based on the angel’sHebrew name, Rikbi’el, “God’s vehicle,” or “God’s chariot”:Why is his name called Rikbi’el?Because he is in charge of the wheels of the chariotand they are committed to his keeping.”76THE YOKE OF GOD’S KINGDOM. . . thousands of thousands of thousandsand myriads of myriads of myriadsgive praise and exaltation to yourgreat, mighty and awesome name."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"The Concept of God: Mystical and Mythological Dimensions117Before you stand all the mighty ones.Who are powerful in praise and in chant.77MYTHOLOGICAL PATTERNSThe divine realm is shared by many monarchical deities, according toMesopotamian mythology. They are responsible for various aspects ofnature and portions of the cosmos. They also embody abstract moralconcepts. In addition they control particular city states and nations.78Each one of the gods is considered divine, yet they are not equal inpower and hierarchical position. Instead, they are subordinate to onehigh, supreme god, the head of the pantheon. The royal title, “King ofthe Kings,” used often in prayers and hymns addressed to variousdeities, expresses this notion of one god, superior in status and au-thority.79 In an Akkadian hymn, for instance, the god Enlil, chief godof the Sumerian-Assyrio-Babylonian tradition, is entitled: “Lord of lords,king of kings.”80 An Akkadian hymn, dedicated to the god Marduk,likewise proclaims his superiority above all other gods:There is [none] among all the Igigi-godswho can boast before you.You have no rival above or below.Whatever the gods of all the inhabited worldmay have done, they cannot be like you, Lord!81Several sources associate divine kingship with a cosmic struggle.According to such traditions, the head of the pantheon gains his po-sition after winning a battle in which he proves his powers, leader-ship, and superiority. Other deities consequently express theirrecognition of his kingship and proclaim their loyalty in a formal ritual.In his discussion of divine kingship, M. Weinfeld has asserted severaldistinct integrated actions, which form the ritual of accepting the su-preme god’s kingship: prostration, repetition of his names, and praiseof him in unison.82 By performing these ritualistic actions, the gods ofthe pantheon affirm the lofty position of their leader and accept hisultimate authority. Enumah Elish, as noted by Weinfeld, presents anexample of such a ritual. It recounts how the god Marduk defeats thegoddess Tiamat; her army fashions the cosmos and establishes order.Consequently all gods accept him as their king. They bow down,prostrate themselves before him, and address him in a speech:They did obeisance to him and the gods spoke to him.They addressed their lord Lugal-dimmer-ankin,“Previously the Lord was [our beloved] son.But now he is our king. We shall take heed of his command.”83"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"118Beholders of Divine SecretsTo express their acceptance of his kingship, all the gods togetherpronounce Marduk’s various names, using a threefold formula ofsanctification as they bow down:Anshar, Lahmu, and Lahamu called his three names.They pronounced them to the gods, their sons.“We have given him each of these three names.Now you, pronounce his name as we did!”84The great gods assembledAnd made Marduk’s destiny highest.They themselves did obeisance....Thus they granted that he should exercisethe kingship of the godsAnd confirmed for him mastery ofthe gods of heaven and earth.Anshar gave him another name: ASARLUHI.“At the mention of his name we shall bow down!The gods are to pay heed to what he says.His command is to have priority above and below.”85In several biblical sources, mythical imagery is utilized to depictGod’s kingship.86 In addition, various of texts express God’s supremekingship in heaven by portraying divine beings who acknowledge hisunequaled rule by acts of prostration, repetition of names, and prais-ing in unison. Originally such divine groups, like “the sons of god”( , ), “the council of the holy ones” “Morning Stars”( ) and the host of heaven ( ), were thought to rep-resent independent beings, other than the one God, as scholars havedemonstrated.87 Psalm 89: 5–6, for example, illustrates this notion inits presentation of divine beings accepting YHWH as a king over thegods by praising and exulting him:Let the heavens praise your wonders, O Lord,and your faithfulness in the assembly of the holy ones.For who in the skies can be compared to the Lord?Who is like the Lord among the heavenly beings?Psalm 29:1–2 envisions the gods giving praise and prostrating them-selves before Yahweh:88Ascribe to the Lord, O heavenly beings.Ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.Ascribe to the Lord the glory of his name.Prostrate yourselves to the Lord when he appears in holiness.Several other sources include similar representation of divine be-ings praising God, repeating his names, prostrating themselves, sing-"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"The Concept of God: Mystical and Mythological Dimensions119ing in one voice, and repeating the threefold sanctification. The prophetIsaiah sees divine beings speak to one another and praise Yahweh:“Holy holy holy is the Lord of (the heavenly) hosts” (Isa. 6: 3).89In Job38: 7, members of Yahweh’s council sing to him jointly: “While themorning stars sang together and all the heavenly beings shouted to-gether.” In accordance with Israel’s monotheistic perspective, theseindependent divine beings have been transformed into ministers ofthe Lord or serving angels. Accordingly, the meaning of the pattern ofpraise has been altered as it has come to express the greatness of the oneGod. Nonetheless mythological themes are present. They allude to in-dependent divine beings, who accept the kingship of the supreme godby prostration, repetition of his names, and the praise of him in unison.HEKHALOT AND MERKAVAH MYSTICISMAs we examine various Hekhalot and Merkavah accounts, the ancientNear Eastern model of recognizing God’s ultimate authority seems toreappear. It is possible that this mythological, ritualistic pattern gainsa special significance in this literature because of the composite andmixed concept of the divine realm it depicts.90 R. Elior has examinedthe nature and development of the angelic realm in the Hekhalot andMerkavah literature, noting that its extensive presentation of the an-gelic world is unparalleled in any other Jewish source. This literaturerecognizes very openly the existence of many independent divinebeings other than the one God. Their traditional biblical role as God’smessengers or servants is far surpassed. The Hekhalot and Merkavahangels are almost autonomous operating by God’s side.91 These divinebeings, moreover, share many of God’s sacred characteristics: names,attributes, features, responsibilities, and even some creative powers.Various examples illustrate this perception. There are the “eightrevered and awesome princes, who are called YHWH by the name oftheir King.”92 God’s ineffable name is given to the angel Metatron whois called “lesser YHWH.” He sits on a throne “like the throne of glory,”adorned with God’s crown and draped with a royal cloak. He alsoknows “the wisdom of this world and the wisdom of the world tocome,” like the Creator himself.93 Prince Anafi’el is another example.He is crowned with “the bough of his majesty, glory, crown and bril-liance and his splendor overshadows all the chambers of the highestheaven, like the creator of the world.”94 As a divine being, almostequal to God, he also keeps the divine emblems: “the signet ring ofheaven and earth is in his hand.”95In addition, there are various an-gels with specific divine roles and privileges, such as the Prince Hayli‘elYHWH, “a prince who is able to swallow the whole world at onegulp. . . . he is in charge of the creatures.” These include also “Soperi‘el"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"120Beholders of Divine SecretsYHWH who puts to death” and “Soperi‘el YHWH who makes alive.”96The angel Keruvi‘el is another example of the Hekhalot tendency to offera mythical depiction of an independent divine being, powerful in nature,who operates next to God. This angel resembles God in appearance andshares many of his powers, attributes, and qualities of holiness:Keruvi‘el YHWH is his name, a valiant prince, full ofboundless power; a majestic prince with whom is majesty;a righteous prince with whom is righteousness; a holyprince with whom is holiness; a prince glorified by thou-sands of hosts, a prince extolled by countless legions. Athis wrath the earth quakes; at his rage camps tremble; thefoundations shudder from fear of him and Arabot quakesat his rebuke. His body is full of burning coals; it is as highas the seven heavens, as broad as the seven heavens, aswide as the seven heavens. The opening of his mouth blazeslike a fiery torch, and his tongue is consuming fire. Hiseyelashes are as the splendor of lightning. His eyes are likebrilliant sparks, and his face looks like a blazing fire. Acrown of holiness is on his head with the sacred nameengraved upon it, from which lightning flickers. The bowof the Shekinah is across his shoulders.97In his discussion of the angelic world in the Hekhalot literature,J. Dan observes: “the term ‘angels’ in its biblical meaning certainlydoes not apply to them, for they are powers in their own right, at leastto a certain extent, and they carry the supreme holy name in their ownright.”98 Although it is clear that these powerful divine beings do notshare God’s sovereign power, the differences between them andthe supreme God in some cases are not clear. What seems apparent inthe Hekhalot literature is a fear of “two authorities in heaven.”99 Inthis context, the nature of the angelic praises appears to be of greatimportance.Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism admits a certain correlationbetween God and other principal divine beings. This correlation ech-oes a mythological notion of a multitude of divine powers, whichcould obviously have been regarded as a potential threat to traditionalmonotheistic views, especially in light of Gnostic and other Christianand pagan influences. Therefore, Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism,while allowing the existence of such divine beings and according thema significant role, nonetheless emphasizes their subordinate positionto the one God. These divine powers are portrayed as subservient toGod’s control and authority in a traditional mythological pattern, simi-lar to the one presented above. They all accept God’s kingship bypraising him, prostrating themselves before him, and repeating his"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"The Concept of God: Mystical and Mythological Dimensions121names in unison. A passage in Ma’ashe Merkavah describes a heavenlyritual of exalting God and praising his name:. . . thousands of thousands of thousandsand myriads of myriads of myriadsgive praise and exaltationto your great, mighty and awesome name.Before you stand all the mighty ones;Who are powerful in praise and in chant.100All creatures, including angels and other divine beings, must prostratethemselves, praise God, and affirm his eternal kingship:Before you, YHWH God of Israel, kneel and prostratethose on high and on low. Before you, YHWH God of Israel,Seraphim glorify and sing. Before you, YHWH God of Israel,Seraphim sing and rejoice. The throne of your glory praises youand gives you pride, and much strength and splendor.Before you, YHWH God of Israel,your servants crown you with crowns,and sing to you a new song. They enthrone you eternally,and you shall be called One forever and ever.101It seems that in order to display a complete acceptance of God’skingship, all divine powers must sing together the hymns of praise.Any departure from this practice is severely punished, perhaps toavoid any potential threat to the supremacy of the one God:Therefore, they have intent, and hurry, and shine, and gatherin fear, purity, and holiness, and they say commendationand chant, adoration and praise with one voice, with onespeech, with one knowledge, with one sound. And not onlythis, but from them fall thousands and thousands, myriadsand myraids into rivers of fire and are burned. Since whenthey sing songs and sanctification before the King of theKings of Kings, there is no early and late, no one who low-ers or no one who elevates. Therefore, he who sings earlieror later than his friends will be burned.102These heavenly rituals are not presented simply as poetic, literary de-scriptions. It is the absolute duty of all creatures in heaven to engage inthem, including the human visionaries who reach the upper level. Alldescenders to the chariot, who enter the celestial realm, are obliged toparticipate in the heavenly praise, accept the yoke of God’s kingdom, andexpress their absolute obedience to him, using the threefold sanctification:And every knee kneels before you and every tongue testifiesand every dignified one bows and falls downbefore you, YHWH our God."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"122Beholders of Divine SecretsTo the glory of your name they will give honor.And all of them will accept the yoke of your kingdom.And you will reign over them soon, forever and ever.Because yours is the kingdomand you will reign in glory forever.And I will sanctify your name great, and mighty and awesome,holy, holy, holy. . . .103This requirement for Hekhalot devotees to join in the praise ofGod is highlighted, perhaps, because of a new and daring option whichthe Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism allows. Human beings caninitiate and make an ascent to heaven to join the divine realm. Theycan even acquire several divine-like qualities.104 Hekhalot and Merkavahauthors, however, insist upon the adepts’ obligation to praise God andaccept his kingship. Thus, their presence in the celestial divine realmcan in no way be interpreted as a threat to God’s superior authority.For this reason, perhaps, the accounts emphasize again and again theneed to declare clearly an unconditional recognition of God’s supremekingship, an obligation which is required of all creatures when theyreach the divine.A prayer in Ma’ashe Merkavah offers a short conclusion to thissection. It expresses the magnitude of God through specific concreteelements — heavenly palaces, thrones, and chariots — which manifesthis majesty and supremacy in conventional mythological patterns:Great is your name on the entire earth.In heavens you founded your throne.And your dwelling place in the highest heights.Your chariot you placed in the height of heaven,in the pure mist.Hosts of fire praise your glory.Seraphim of fire stand before you.105GOD’S SPIRITUAL-FIGURATIVE IMAGEThe great, mighty and fearsome, grand and powerful God,who is hidden from the eyes of all creaturesand concealed from the serving angels,but is revealed to Rabbi Akivathrough the work of the Merkavah.106Descriptions of God’s figurative image are prominent in Hekhalot andMerkavah mysticism. What we find in several accounts are two prin-cipal ways of speaking of God. One introduces the divine by referringto his body and organs and detailing their names and measurements.The second is concerned with God’s other physical attributes such as"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"The Concept of God: Mystical and Mythological Dimensions123his majestic radiance, personified names, regal garments, crowns, otheremblems of authority and his specific physical features. This figurativepattern of representation seems to express God’s transcendent andsublime attributes in mythological language and images, as the dis-cussion below will demonstrate.THE MEASURE OF THE DIVINE’S BODY (SHIUR KOMAH)Anyone who knows this measureand the praise of his Creator,who is covered from all people,is promised to be among those of the world to come.107MYTHOLOGICAL PATTERNSIn a variety of Near Eastern myths and iconographical presentations,deities are often depicted in an anthropomorphic or zoomorphic fash-ion. Through these depictions, the powers and characteristics of thedeities are communicated in a direct, explicit manner. In addition tothese depictions, several literary accounts reveals an alternate patternof representation, according to which the figurative description of theform and body of the gods, paradoxically, serves to express their in-accessible, transcendent, and abstract nature. In his discussion ofaniconism and anthropomorphism in the ancient Near East, R. S.Hendel has entitled this model of portrayal as “transcendent anthro-pomorphism,” a title which clearly exemplifies a dialectical tendencyto denote the deities’ inaccessibility and ultimate transcendence throughdescriptions of their figurative or anthropomorphic manifested form.108Several figurative and concrete images are often used: anthropomor-phic or zoomorphic form, fiery essence, huge cosmic size, lists of bodilyparts and their names. At times names of different deities are equatedwith these bodily parts.An effective example is the depiction of the god Marduk inEnuma Elish. An account of Marduk’s birth, in tablet I: 79–100, pre-sents speculations on his nature. The passage describes his anthro-pomorphic form and stature, relates the enormous size of his figure,and asserts his unique bodily features and fiery essence. Thesecorporeal characteristics of the god Marduk, the text attests, are farbeyond human perception. They are distinguished as “impossibleto understand, too difficult to perceive” and express, it seems, hisinconceivable nature. Thus, the elaborate portrayal of the god’smanifested anthropomorphic form and stature proclaims his non-human features and his imperceptibility:Proud was his form, piercing his stature,Mature his emergence, he was powerful from the start"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"124Beholders of Divine SecretsElevated far above them. He was superior in every way.His limbs were ingeniously made beyond comprehension,Impossible to understand, too difficult to perceive.Four were his eyes, four were his ears;When his lips moved, fire blazed forth.The four ears perceived everything.Highest among the gods, his form was outstanding.His limbs were very long, his height outstanding.109The details presented clearly refer to Marduk’s visible statureand to specific corporeal characteristics such as limbs, organs, andappearance. Yet a quality of inscrutability is applied to the godthrough the descriptions of his huge body, specific organs, and lumi-nous fiery essence. These seemingly recognizable features exceed bothhuman form and normal human perception. They, thus, emphasizeMarduk’s inaccessible, unknowable mysterious essence, “made be-yond comprehension.” In addition, the god Marduk is exalted abovethe other gods to the degree that his body transcends their anthro-pomorphism. He is ‘other’ from the ordinary gods insofar as he is‘other ’ from human form.110An earlier example, found in the Sumerian Gudea cylinders, pre-sents a similar dialectical pattern of “transcendent anthropomor-phism.”111 In the context of complex cultic and ritual issues, the Gudeacylinders introduce a simple narrative plot. According to Cylinder A,the man Gudea, in his dream, receives a vision of the god Ningirsuwho commands the construction of a new temple for himself. Gudearecounts his dream for interpretation, describing the appearance of thegod Ningirsu, whom, at this point, he does not recognize. In thisdescription specific figurative images are applied. Gudea describes thegod’s cosmic, gigantic form. He also portrays the god in an anthropo-morphic and a zoomorphic manner, as a man, encompassing a god’sface, an eagle’s arms and a body of storm:In the dream there was a man as gigantic as heaven, asgigantic as the earth. According to his head he was a god;according to his arms he was the eagle; according to hislower body he was a storm; on his right and left lions werestanding; he commanded me to build his house; his (pre-cise) intent I did not understand.112Explicit corporeal, visible images undoubtedly predominate in thisportrayal. Yet, paradoxically, these express the god’s imperceptiblenature, which Gudea, a human being, cannot fathom. As A. Livingstonehas observed, in Mesopotamian mystical and mythological descrip-"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"The Concept of God: Mystical and Mythological Dimensions125tions such as this, the figurative delineation of the god’s form presents“the ineffable nature of the divine by offering descriptions which areonly barely conceivable.”113 Figurative details regarding Ningirsu’sgigantic anthropomorphic and zoomprphic form, his god’s face, eagle’sarms and his body of storm, do not intend to reduce the god to afamiliar form. Rather, they give expression to his unknowable, inac-cessible nature. The imagery used also highlights the full dialectic ofthe “transcendent anthropomorphism” pattern by equating the god’stangible, corporeal body with the image of the storm, which denoteshis abstract, limitless, nature.A Mesopotamian hymn to the god Ninurta, from the first millen-niumB.C.E., reflects an additional example. This hymn exalts the godNinurta by portraying his body, to which several parallel dimensionsare ascribed: an anthropomorphic form, cosmic size, a list of organs,and the specific names of these organs, associated with various divinebeings and with aspects of the cosmos. The hymn includes a series ofsentences, each containing a reference to an organ of Ninurta’s bodyand its name which is aligned to the various gods of the pantheon:O Lord, your face is like the sun god.Your eyes, O Lord are Enlil and Ninlil.The pupils of your eyes are Gula and Belit-ili.The irises of your eyes are the twins Sin and Shamash.The lashes of your eyes are the rays of the sun god. . . .The appearance of your mouth, O Lord, is Ishtar of the stars.Anu and Antum are your lips, your command.Your tongue (?) is Pabilsag of the above.The roof of your mouth, O Lord, is the vaultof heaven and earth, your divine abode.114This portrayal is illustrative of the “transcendent anthropomor-phism” model. Ninurta is depicted in what seems to be human form.Specific features such as the god’s eyes, pupils, irises, lashes, mouth,lips, and tongue are mentioned. This presentation, however, has nocoherent meaning or sense. Instead, it transcends human comprehen-sion and conveys Ninurta’s uniqueness and transcendence.The god’s corporeal features are of infinite cosmic dimension,compared in size to Heaven and Earth. It is also important to note thatNinurta’s seemingly anthropomorphic body is totally different from ahuman form. The hymn equates Ninutra’s bodily features with vari-ous deities and thus seems to ascribe to him a metaphysical, all-encompassing stature. The pattern of correlating parts of one god’sbody with other gods is probably a theological attempt to synthesizediverse gods into the image of a supreme single god, who embraces"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"126Beholders of Divine Secretsthe sum total of their qualities. This aspect, however, is denoted throughthe figurative depiction of Ninirta’s revealed body, which conveys hisomnipotent, ultimate nature, imperceptible to human’s comprehen-sion. “Nintuta’s body is transcendent,” attests Hendel, “his body isinconceivable as his authority is all encompassing.”115Central views present in biblical traditions, particularly inDeuteronomistic sources, clearly negate the visible, figurative featuresof God, emphasizing instead the divine’s transcendence and his ver-bal, auditory manifestation.116 Yet, an avoidance of figurative imageryis not a common characteristic of the biblical corpus.117 Sufficient evi-dence demonstrates that a corporeal conception of God was accept-able in a variety of biblical traditions.118 Non- and pre-Deuteronomisticsources, as well as later works including prophetic and postexilic,priestly traditions, evidently utilize figurative, iconic, anthropomor-phic imagery in their conceptions of God. The verbal expressions foundin these sources do not endorse an acceptance of worshiping iconiccult statues.119 Various linguistic expressions, nonetheless, presupposea “mental anthropomorphic” conception of the divine.120Aligned with the notion of “mental iconography” is the employ-ment of the “transcendent anthropomorphism” model in several bib-lical presentations of God. According to the observation of Hendel,earlier biblical descriptions, clearly non- and pre-Deuteronomistic,exercise a model of “transcendent anthropomorphism” especially intheir “God sighting” episodes. These sources confirm the visible pres-ence of Yahweh, described as having an anthropomorphic form. Thisvision, nonetheless, entails fatal danger to most human beings, as thefollowing examples demonstrate. In Genesis 32:30, Jacob attests: “ForI have seen God face-to-face and yet my life is preserved.” In Exodus33:20, God announces to Moses: “ You cannot see my face, for no oneshall see my face and live.” The prophet Isaiah declares:” I am lost forI am a man of unclean lips . . . yet my eyes have seen the King, theLord of hosts” (Isa. 6:5). A similar perception is raised by Maanoah inJudges 13: 22: “We surely shall die for we have seen God.” “Like thebody of Marduk, Ninurta, and Ningirsu” asserts Hendel, “Yahewh’sbody was believed to be incommensurate with mundane humanexistence: it has a different degree of being than human bodies.”121The deadly effect of seeing the body of God is rooted in the bib-lical conception of purity and danger, according to which that whichis holy is also dangerous. As the most holy, God’s form is a source ofextreme danger and the vision of it is impossible to most humans. Thedialectic of holiness and danger, thus, exemplifies the model of “tran-scendent anthropomorphism” in these biblical traditions. Paradoxi-cally, the manifested divine body conveys a conception of God, who"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"The Concept of God: Mystical and Mythological Dimensions127is inaccessible and inscrutable. In Hendel’s words: “it is a transcendentanthropomorphism not in its form but in its effect, approachable onlyby the most holy, and absent in material form in the cult.”122This perspective indicates tension between the manifested God’sform and the human’s ability to behold it. Examining theophanies inbiblical traditions, J. Barr suggests that the main significance of God’stheophanic descriptions is not whether God is portrayed in humanform but, rather, why such anthropomorphic revelations occur tospecific selected individuals: “The central truth is the ability of God toassume a form and to let this form be seen by men.”123“Nothing isindeed more significant about the anthropomorphic theophanies thanthat they have occurred to special and isolated persons in the past.”124The significance of God’s form, therefore, is derived from its func-tion. Only a few selected individuals can behold visions of God andendure his holiness and awesomeness, which destroy most humans.Seeing God and surviving, thus, is a form of blessing, an indication ofspiritual merits, and a legitimization of role and position. The oneswho see God are elevated into a state of holiness in which they canexperience his presence directly, in a personal manner.125 A very tellingexample is Moses, described, for example, in Numbers 12:8 as the onewho “beholds the form of the Lord,” to whom God speaks clearlymouth to mouth ( ).126In addition to these presentations, several biblical sources, such asIsaiah 6 and Ezekiel 1, utilize a model of “transcendent anthropomor-phism” comparable to the Mesopotamian model. These sources alsopresent Yahweh’s theophany in a manner which transcends a corpo-real perception of the divine and asserts his otherness, boundlessnessand indefinableness.127 Ezekiel, for example, describes God’s kavod,which he saw seated above the throne in his heavenly vision, as “some-thing that seemed like a human form” (1:26).128 This depiction is highlyanthropomorphic, primarily since Ezekiel uses terms demut and mar’ehwhich imply a concrete representation.129 Yet the cautious language ofEzekiel, J. M. Miller has asserted, suggests that the appearance of God’sglory “defies adequate description.”130HEKHALOT AND MERKAVAH MYSTICISMTheShi’ur Komah doctrine, found in various versions in the Hekhalotand Merkavah literature and in other sources, presents a unique con-ception of the divine.131 According to this doctrine, God is assumed topossess a corporal, visual form, accessible to initiated Merkavah vi-sionaries. The Shi’ur Komah descriptions refer to God’s stature. Theylist the specific features of his body, identifying them by name and mea-surement. These texts ascribe to God’s body and organs immeasurable"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"128Beholders of Divine Secretscosmic dimension, and distinguish these bodily features by illegiblenames, composed of unknown combination of letters, or of lettersidentified with the letters of God’s ineffable name. This direct, corpo-real, figurative portrayal of God clearly stands in contrast to the con-ventional conception of the transcendent, abstract nature of the divine.Thus, questions regarding the origin of the Shi’ur Komah unequaleddoctrine, as well as the aim and the meaning of its corporal portrayalof God, have been the subject of much controversy from early to morerecent times.132One explanation of the figurative portrayal of the divine in theShiur Komah traditions, modern scholars have suggested, is rooted inthe fundamental distinction between God’s indefinable essence andhis manifested appearance.133In contrast, a different understating oftheShi’ur Komah tradition perceives no distinction between God’shidden and visible aspects, only a paradox of transcendence and im-manence.134 Study of the origin of the Shi’ur Komah tradition has stressedlinks between this doctrine and several themes found in Gnosticsources.135The Talmudic scholar, S. Liberman, and other scholars havecontended that the Shi’ur Komah tradition grew as an ancient esotericexegesis on the Song of Songs, especially on chapter 5:10–11.136From a different perspective, I suggest, it is possible to examine theShi’ur Komah traditions in light of the mythological “transcendent an-thropomorphism” model of description. It seems that such a model,embedded in ancient Near Eastern traditions and found later, in a morerestricted fashion, in various biblical and apocalyptic sources, is evokedin the Shi’ur Komah context of Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism.137TheShi’ur Komah descriptions make clear that their main concernis the manifested, visible aspect of the divine body. In order to provideanswers to questions such as: “How much is the measure of the stat-ure of the Holy One, blessed be he?”several parallel descriptions areprovided.138 They assert God’s corporeal form, list his various bodilyfeatures and elucidate their measurements. For example:The parasangs of His feet fill the entire world,as it is said: “Heaven is My throneand the earth is My footstool” (Isaiah 66:1).The height of His soles is 30 million parasangs.His right sole is called PRMSYYH ATYRKNYand the left AGTMTZ.The height from His sole to the ankle is 150 millionparasangs. Similarly the left.The right ankle is called TZGMTNYHand the left ASTMZ.From His ankle to the knees is 190,005,200 parasangs.Similarly the left.139"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"The Concept of God: Mystical and Mythological Dimensions129This depiction is clearly highly anthropomorphic. The measurementsassigned to God’s various organs, however, are given in enormousmultiplied units of ten million parasangs (Persian miles) which cannotbe grasped. The smallest unit of these huge dimensions is comparedto God’s little finger which stretches from one end of the world to theother, indicating that the size of the Shi’ur Komah is, in fact, infinite,immeasurable, and inaccessible to human imagination:Every parasang equals three miles, and every mile equalsten thousand ells, and every ell equals two small fingers,like His small finger. And His small finger fills the wholeworld.”140Each cosmic part of God’s body is given an illegible name, composedof an unknown combination of letters, or of letters identified with theletters of God’s ineffable name:The right knee is called Satmagatz Yehamiyi and that of theleft is called Maghanuriyah. The right thigh is calledShashtastafarnisiyi and the left is called Tafganichaziza. From[God’s] thighs to the neck is 240 million parasangs. [God’s]thighs are called Astanah. . . dadiyah.141These names seldom convey any meaning. They mostly amountto indecipherable expressions far beyond human understanding. Men-tions of seemingly familiar characteristics, such as specific corporealparts and their measurements and names are, in fact, beyond humancomprehension. They serve to convey, therefore, the incomprehensiblenature of the inscrutable God:The nose, Kngbziha is its name. . . . His tongue from oneend of the universe to the other....The width of His fore-head is Mssgyhuyvayyh. The name of the width of His fore-head is Istanyahu Stnyhn. . . . The black of His right eye is10,000,500 parsangs and so is the left. The name of the right[eye] is az dhyh attysvname and its prince is Rahbiel.142Images of light, fire, sparks, lightening, and torches are often usedto characterize God’s figure in the Shi’ur Komah tradition: “You are fire”the text declares. It also alludes to the “form of his beauty and splen-dor,” and describes “the splendor of [God’s] glory” as “luminous, awe-some in the darkness.”143The radiant splendor of God, suggests E. R.Wolfson, assumes the shape of a human form. Yet, insofar as it “appliedto the enthroned form of the glory, it connotes at once corporeality andluminosity; indeed, the one is expressed through the other.144As scholars have stressed, the figurative descriptions of God serveto convey God’s incomprehensible, and transcendent nature, which is"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"130Beholders of Divine Secretsfar beyond human comprehension. In Scholem’s view, “The enormousfigures have no intelligible meaning or sense-content . . . they are bet-ter calculated, on the contrary, to reduce every attempt at such visionto absurdity.”145 Dan asserts that the descriptions emphasize that “thedivine ‘body’ is beyond all knowledge, transcending comprehension .. .”146 According to Elior the anthropomorphic descriptions of Godintend to “glorify Him, to transcend Him and to create endless dis-tance between man and God.”147“The point of completely absurdcalculation, asserts Schäfer, is to demonstrate that God cannot be con-ceived of in human categories.148Wolfson’s analysis suggests that be-yond “the ‘reductio ad absurdum’ of these anthropomorphicspeculation on God . . . it is necessary to embrace the paradox in itsfull dialectic: the divine form in conceivable in its imperceptibility,revealed in its hideness.”149 These observations seem to demonstratethat the new and daring depiction of God in the Shiur Komah tradi-tions corresponds, in fact, to the ancient pattern of “transcendent an-thropomorphism” and its dialectical conceptual principles.It is also important to note that Shi’ur Komah and ancientMesopotamian descriptions share a similar literary style and imagery,as various examples illustrate. First, as part of the Shi’ur Komah depic-tion of God’s figure, specific divine princes are equated with severalof his body parts: “The name of the right [eye] is az dhyh attysvnameand its prince is Rahbiel.”150 This aspect is not dominant in the Shi’urKomahdoctrine. Surprisingly, however, it parallels the Mesopotamiandescription of the god Ninurta’s bodily parts, which are aligned withvarious divine figures. Second, the Shi’ur Komah lists include certainspecific parts of the divine body which are strikingly reminiscent ofthe Mesopotamian depiction of the god Ningirsu: the soles of God’sfeet, his heels, hips, hands, neck, head, beard, nose, forehead, andcheeks as well as God’s right and left eyes, pupils, iris, mouth, lips,and tongue.151A similar literary style, according to which a series ofsentences contain references to both an organ of the deity’s body andto its name and qualities, is also found in the ancient Mesopotamianhymn and the Shi’ur Komah presentation.Finally, in addition to anthropomorphic characteristics, severaldescriptions ascribed zoopomorphic features to God, which cannot bereconciled with the human body:Sitting in his palace, his feet surrounded by clouds offire . . . like the sun, like the moon, like the stars, like theface of a man, the face of an eagle, the talons of a lion, thehorns of an ox.

Blessed be his nameforever.152As this passage connotes, God embraces figurative features associatedwith a man, an eagle, a lion, and an ox. The God’s appearance ex-presses his inaccessibility and ultimate transcendence, metaphorically,through use of images of spirit and soul that no creature can recog-nize. Details of this description recall the Mesopotamian anthropo-morphic-zoomorphic-transcendent portrayal of the god Ninurta, inGudea Cylinder A examined above, as a man embodying a god’s face,an eagle’s arms, and a body of storm.GOD’S APPEARANCE. . . from His beauty the deeps are burned,and from His stature the heavens are burned.His stature emits proud onesand His crown shatters mighty ones,and His garments sweep precious.153MYTHOLOGICAL PATTERNSSeveral attributes of the gods are repeatedly presented in ancientNear Eastern iconography and literary sources: majestic radiance,personified names, regal garments, crowns, emblems of authority, andspecific physical features. These often express notions of divinity, su-periority, and high status manifested in a tangible fashion..Qualities of radiance and light are thought to be the divines’ in-herent characteristics. The Sumerian term “NI” and the Akkadian term“melammû” (literally, radiance, splendor luminosity) defines the gods’supernatural awe-inspiring quality. It is a brilliant, visible glamor,exuded by gods, heroes, and sometimes by kings, that induce awe andfear in the believers.154 In his discussion of “why Mesopotamian reli-gion should not be written,” A. L. Oppenheim explains the nature ofits religious thought: “ . . . the deity in Mesopotamia is experienced asan awesome and fear-inspiring phenomenon, endowed with a unique,unearthly and terrifying luminosity. Luminosity is considered to be adivine attribute and is shared in a varying degree of intensity by allthings considered divine and holy. We find again the same groping ofthe expression of the ineffable in terms of a fearful supernatural radi-ance emanating from the deity.”155Mythological patterns of thought often perceive names as inte-gral parts of the phenomenon they represent. This conception ispresent in ancient Near Eastern sources in which the names of thegods are considered to be manifestations of their being. They em-body the essence of the gods and are regarded as identical with their"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"132Beholders of Divine Secretsbearers.156 Furthermore, as S. Olyan observes, divine names are oftenconsidered independent and sometimes appear to be corporeal. Accord-ing to several ancient Near Eastern accounts, such names often receiveforms of cultic devotion.157Divine emblems likewise exhibit the high position of the gods. Forexample, “the rod and ring” indicate divine authority in a concretefashion. These emblems are depicted as a pair of measuring instru-ments. They symbolize divine justice and kingship, as we see in tex-tual and artistic representations.158 Sometime the rod and ring appearto be a staff and a chaplet of beads, likewise representing divine sta-tus. The seals of the gods are an additional emblem. These representtheir kingship and ensure their royal authority. According to Babyloniantradition, for example, in the New Year ceremony the fates for thecoming year were fixed by writing on the tablet of destinies.159In other representations Mesopotamian deities are often crowned.They are distinguished as well by specific garments of notable sym-bolic value. A. L. Oppenheim has examined texts and monumentsrelating to such “golden garments of the gods.” Of the numerous neo-Babylonian texts of the seventh century B.C.E., which refer to the gar-ments of the gods, several describe garments with golden stars orclouds. These decorations perhaps endowed these garments with anaura of divinity and emphasized the status of the gods.160 A passageinEnumah Elish describes Marduk’s rise to power. It speaks of severalfeatures which manifest divine kingship and make it perceptible: aprincely garment, a royal aura, a crown, and a staff:He put on a princely garment,A royal aura, a splendid crown.He took up a mace and grasped it in his right hand.161The quality of beauty is also often attributed to the gods as wellas specific facial features.162 For example, a beard is a characteristic ofseveral gods. One example is the Babylonian god Enki, representedoften as a seated god with long beard, a cap, and a robe.163 The godEl, head of the pantheon in Ugaritic mythology, is also depicted as abearded god, as texts and iconography attest. El’s beard is mentionedby the goddess Ashera as a symbol of his greatness: “You are great, OEl, and indeed wise; your hoary beard instructs you.”164 The goddessAnat mentions El’s gray beard as well.165Concrete patterns of depiction are present occasionally in bib-lical sources. God’s uniqueness and superiority are expressed attimes by references to his physical appearance, in particular hisillustrious radiance, names, garments, emblems of authority, andphysical features."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"The Concept of God: Mystical and Mythological Dimensions133Divine aspects, such as God’s name and glory, describe his pres-ence in priestly and deuteronomist traditions. As Mettinger has dem-onstrated, deuteronomic sources present Yahweh enthroned in Heavenbut his name dwells on Earth. Thus, the name embodies God andrepresents his presence. For example, God’s sanctuary is “the placewhere the Lord will choose to cause his name to dwell” (Deut. 16: 2).In Jeremiah as well God’s name is thought to dwell in the temple.166The divine name is clearly personified in Exodus 23: 20–21, where itis said to lead Israel. Olyan notes that in contrast with ancient NearEastern sources, however, God’s names never receive any form of culticdevotion in biblical descriptions.167Priestly circles present Yahweh’s qualities of splendor or radiance askavod(), or hod( ). This is the brilliant radiance thought to emanatefrom his being.168 Habakkuk 3: 3–4 describes a theophanic vision of God:“His splendor covers the heavens. The earth is filled with his radiance.There is brilliant light with his rays on every side.” The seventy elders ofIsrael saw God: “Under his feet there was the likeness of a pavement ofsapphire like the very sky for purity” (Ex. 24: 10). Ezekiel sees “radianceall about him” (Ezek. 1: 27–28). Psalm 104 describes God “clothed withhonor and majesty, wrapped in light as with garment” (1–2).Diverse biblical texts portray God as a king enthroned with acrown.169 Several passages allude to God’s garments (Isa. 6: 1; Ezek. 16:8; Dan. 7: 9; Isa. 63: 1–3; Ps. 60: 10), and even his sandals (Ps. 108: 10).Daniel describes God’s garments as well as his white hair: “And theancient of days took his seat. His garment was like white snow andthe hair on his head like pure wool” (Dan. 7: 9). Isa. 33:17 ascribesbeauty to God, parallel to other passages (e.g., Ps. 45:3–4).HEKHALOT AND MERKAVAH MYSTICISMHekhalot and Merkavah mysticism conveys the excellence and supe-riority of God by applying several images which correspond to an-cient Near Eastern mythological convention discussed above. Majesticradiance, personified names, royal garments, crowns, emblems of au-thority, and specific physical features are linked together to expressthe supremacy of God in a tangible manner.God of the Hekhalot and Merkavah is a crowned king. He is alsosurrounded by an awe-inspiring radiance and light:King of kings of kings, God of gods,Lord of lords,He who is exalted with chains of crowns,Encircled by branches of brilliance,Who “covers the heavens” with the branch of his glory.170"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"134Beholders of Divine SecretsThe image of the rays of brilliance in this passage seems to coincideto God’skavod or hod and to the Mesopotamian NI or melammû. InHekhalot and Merkavah mysticism, it receives a visual dimension andbecomes the object of beholding.God’s names, likewise, are described in this literature as embodi-ments of God’s essence. A formula repeated in several Hekhalotdescriptions attests to this concept:He is His name and His name is Him.He is in Him and His name is in His name.171The names also contain God’s substance and qualities:His name is like His might and His might is like His name.He is His power and His power is Himand His name is like His name.172God’s names are not seen as titles or epithets. Instead, they appearto be autonomous and accessible to human perception as such.173Likewise they receive ritual adoration from divine beings who “bringto [God’s] name, great, mighty and awesome, adornment and glory,”and proclaim: “Let your name be declared holy in the sanctification.Let it be magnified in greatness. Let it be made mighty inmight. . . .”174A ring and a seal similarly give a concrete representation of God’ssupremacy. Various accounts state that God sealed Heaven and Earthwith the signet ring in his hand.175 God’s beauty, including his beard,is an additional attribute which manifests his uniqueness in a concretefashion. God’s face, in particular, is the focus of attention:Fine countenance, adorned countenance, countenance of beauty,countenance of flame is the countenance of YHWH,the God of Israel, when He sits upon His throne of gloryand His praise is high in the seat of His splendorHis beauty is finer than the beauty of valor.176The beauty of God’s face is awesome and overwhelming. Thus, it hasan harmful effect upon fearful observers:Those who serve Him today will not serve Him tomorrow,and those who serve Him tomorrow will no longer serveHim. For their strength has lessened and their faces haveblacken, their hearts are confused, and their eyes becomedarkened because of the radiance glory of the beauty oftheir king. . . .177God’s majestic appearance adds to his regal status: “his garment iswhite like snow; his hair on his head is as pure wool.”178 Furthermore,"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"The Concept of God: Mystical and Mythological Dimensions135God’s crown and garment acquire a cosmic dimension which expresseshis divinity:Who is like our King? Who is like our Creator?Who is like YHWH our God?The diadem of His head emanates and radiatesthe sun and the moon.Pleiades and Orion and Mercury and Venus,Constellations and stars and signssweep and emanate from His garment.179As in the mythical model presented earlier, the physical and tangibledetails in the Hekhalot and Merkavah descriptions express God’s lofti-ness and exaltation. These are recognized and acclaimed.MYSTICAL EXEGESISThe sight of His countenance and the sight of His cheeksis like the image of a spiritand like the form of a soul.180A cluster of figurative features vividly describes God’s image, as we haveseen. He is portrayed as an anthropomorphic king, sitting on a gloriousthrone in the royal seventh palace. His brilliant palaces and thrones andhis imperial chariots manifest his supremacy as well as his total authorityover other heavenly powers who accept his rule in unison. God’s divinebody is huge; his limbs are enormous. He wears regal garments and aroyal crown, and holds the signet ring of Heaven and Earth in his hand.Side by side with such figurative, anthropomorphic depiction,various accounts clearly announce God as a transcendent, incompre-hensible being. They express his qualities through abstract images,which have no substance or tangible, visible aspect. These includeimages of spirit and soul and also those of gentle breezes and thebreath of life. All of these representations convey spiritual aspects,which cannot be conceived, defined, distinguished, or limited. Thus,aShi’ur Komah account, examined before, attests:Sitting in His palace, his feet surrounded by clouds of fire . . .like the sun, like the moon, like the stars, like the face of a man,the face of an eagle, the talons of a lion, the horns of an ox.The countenance of His face is like the image of a spirit,and like the form of a soul that no creature can recognize.His body is like chrysolite, filling the entire world. Neither thenear nor the far can look at Him . . .181This description, like several Hekhalot and Merkavah accounts, juxta-poses both tangible and abstract images of divinity. It makes no appar-"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"136Beholders of Divine Secretsent distinction between the two. It is important to note, however, thatthis description is not a general and theoretical depiction of God. In-stead, its portrayal of God is a testament, introduced by Rabbi Akiva,who witnessed God’s presence, and who transmits the knowledge ofhim to others.182The description clearly pertains to the figure of the enthroned God“sitting in His palace, His feet surrounded by clouds of fire.” Thisvision of God, nonetheless, is not allowed to be seen by humans andangels alike since “no creature can recognize, neither the near nor thefar can look at Him.”183In spite of this prohibition, which is dominantin Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism, as we have seen, Rabbi Akivais able to behold God’s form that no creature can recognize.184Heperceives figurative corporeal attributes such as body, form, limbs,and the other specific anthropomorphic-zoomorphic features. At thesame time, Rabbi Akiva also recognizes God’s spiritual qualities andtranscendent nature, presented metaphorically as of soul and spirit.Such visions of a figurative and abstract God are seen from amystical perspective as part of the adepts’ spiritual experience. Theyare revealed, at the peak of the journey, only to worthy descenders tothe chariot, as Rabbi Akiva attests:The great, mighty and fearsome, grand and powerful God,who is hidden from the eyes of all creaturesand concealed from the serving angels,but revealed to Rabbi Akivathrough the work of the Merkavah.185When worthy adepts, such as Rabbi Akiva, acquire an exegetical “un-derstanding of the heart” and consequently a divine-like perspective,they are able to behold manifested divine visions and to understandtheir true essence. Rabbi Akiva’s unique awareness and mystical ex-egesis, thus, seems to reconcile the concrete and the transcendent con-cept of God as the passage cited above demonstrates. He beholds thefigurative appearance of God and perceives his spiritual aspects ofsoul and spirit.An additional personal testament, based on Rabbi Ishmael’s ownexperience, demonstrates the significance of the mystical perception,which allows specific individuals to decode the meaning of divinevisions, to conceive the nature of God, and thus to equate their humanperspective with the divine reality.The sight of His countenance and the sight of His cheeksis like the image of a spirit andlike the form of a soul, and theradiance shines and is terrible out of darkness."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"The Concept of God: Mystical and Mythological Dimensions137Cloud and fog surround him,and all the Princes of the Countenanceare poured out before him through thestrength of the stature of His beauty and His glory.186Rabbi Ishmael does not rely on his sensual and logical perception. Fromhis perspective, the visible, concrete, anthropomorphic features of God’scountenance and cheeks correlate to abstract, intangible images of a gentlebreeze and the breath of life, which connote God’s transcendent essence.It seems, thus, that a spiritual exegetical ability allows Rabbi Ishmael tomake the transition from an ordinary level of awareness to a deeper levelof perception, which enables an attainment of divine truth.As these examples suggest, the tension between the concrete andtranscendent conception of God seems to have been reconciled inHekhalot and Merkavah mysticism in light of the mystical-exegeticalcontext in which it is introduced. The dialectical concept of God and theunique mystical-exegetical ability to perceive this paradox are linkedtogether. Visions of a figurative and abstract God are seen from a mys-tical perspective as part of the adepts’ spiritual experience. At the peakof the journey to the Merkavah, when worthy descenders acquire aspiritual understanding and consequently a divine-like perspective, theyare able to decode and to interpret the true concealed essence of God’smanifested visions. Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Ishmael, exemplary mystics,go far in their mystical comprehension of the divine transcendent andconcrete vision. They behold God’s revealed figurative and concretemanifestation, deciphers its enclosed meaning, and recognizes God’sconcealed, infinite, transcendent and spiritual essence.CONCLUSIONThis chapter examined the manner in which mythological patternsand themes come to express the concept of God in Hekhalot andMerkavah mysticism. As we have seen, God’s sublime and infinitenature is expressed through the application of concrete images andfigurative language, as well as through various themes rooted inMesopotamian and biblical mythological imagery. Powerful imagessuch as enormous physical size, exclusive kingship, majestic appear-ance, and tangible supremacy are evoked. Yet, they do not convey alimited perception of God. Instead, such representation conveys hissupremacy, transcendent, and inaccessibility through the language ofmythology evoked by Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism.Integrated with this presentation is the unique awareness andexegetical perception, mystical in nature, which qualifies Merkavahadepts. Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism emphasizes this spiritual"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"138Beholders of Divine Secretscapability which enables selected individuals to perceive concealedtruths of external manifestations, to behold the invisible God throughhis figurative forms, and thus to bridge divine and human perspec-tives in a manner in which no angel and human usually can. In theprocess of “spiritual exegesis,” the transcendent qualities of God areconceived by worthy visionaries at the end of their spiritual voyage.They behold God as both concrete and abstract. In their descriptions,we see a mystical, human response to divine revelation. The conceptof God they present, therefore, depends upon this perception. InHekhalot and Merkavah mysticism, it appears, it is principally a specifichuman awareness and state of understanding that defines and givesmeaning to visions and images, which convey a mystical conceptionof God in mythological language.Examining the presence of myth in Judaism, M. Fishbane has dis-tinguished five stages of myth and myth making. His observations ofthe fifth stage are based on an analysis of modern poetry. They seem,however, to delineate adequately the interplay between myth, mysti-cism, and exegesis in Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism:Only rarely will a strong poet release images that appear toarise from the very ground of being. In such cases we are onthe brink of myth, and cross over to the realm insofar asimages cohere in some narrative sense. I would even say thatthe poet becomes a mythmaker when his images (or myth-like metaphors) bring new dramatic vitality to the sights andsounds of the world, for himself and for his readers. In theprocess, the poet may utilize and transform images from earliertradition; and such a process may even give the new myth anunexpected exegetical freshness. Nevertheless, the new mo-ment is not exegesis per se but a return through subjectivityto the sounds and the sights of existence.187"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"1396Literary, Phenomenological,Cultural, and Social ImplicationsINTRODUCTIONAt the beginning of this study we looked at Rabbi Akiva’s question asa framework for this analysis of Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism oflate antiquity. Rabbi Akiva asks:Who is able to contemplate the seven palacesand behold the heaven of heavensand see the chambers of chambersand say: “I saw the chamber of YH?”1Thus far the discussion has addressed several aspects of this question. Itexamined the nature of the meditative process which leads the Merkavahadepts to contemplate the seven heavens, ascend to the celestial realm ina spiritual, mental journey, and behold God in his celestial chambers. Italso observed the manner in which these mystical notions were formu-lated and conveyed through the language of mythology.An important segment of this question still remains untreated:Who were the adepts of the Merkavah circle in late antiquity? Who arethose who are “able to contemplate the seven palaces. . . . ascend andbehold the heaven of heavens,” and describe their endeavors in writ-ings? In attempting to answer this question, this chapter will considerpossible cultural and social dimensions of Hekhalot and Merkavahmysticism and the background of its authors. The enigmatic Hekhalotand Merkavah literature does not offer dependable and definite infor-mation, as noted previously. Based on the premise that mystical litera-ture is grounded in a specific religious and social structure, however,it seems beneficial to look at possible cultural and social implicationsof the literary and phenomenological observations presented above.This chapter, as a conclusion of this study, will first briefly sum-marize these previous observations. It will then offer several sugges-"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"140Beholders of Divine Secretstions regarding the possible cultural and ideological affiliation ofHekhalot and Merkavah mysticism and its authors.LITERARY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONSMaintaining the view that scholarly analysis of mystical phenomena isprimarily textually based, this study examined Hekhalot and Merkavahmysticism as found in several treatises and literary accounts. In lightof current observations and methodological premises in the study ofmysticism, several mystical characteristics of this tradition wereidentified. As exhibited above, Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticismdelineates both inner-spiritual experiences and the personal, divinerevelations which they entail. These two aspects are interrelated.Mystical goals, practical methods, spiritual stages, inner conceptualtransformation, divine revelations, and their spiritual exegesis coin-cide and create an integrated, common mystical outlook which, de-spite its noncanonical status, endured over a long period of time.Various literary traditions provide descriptions of a specific pathorvia mystica which leads the Merkavah seekers to a spiritual aware-ness of God during a personal, unmediated experience. As part oftheir effort to attain God, those who journey on this path practicevarious mystical methods, develop an elevated spiritual perception,and expand their consciousness. These inner-spiritual practices lead toself-transformation which results in their achieving a divine-like sta-tus and a new “understanding of the heart.” From their new andelevated position, the Merkavah visionaries are capable of beholdingvisions of God and of deciphering their meaning in a process of spiri-tual exegesis. Their experience is an expanded one. They do not sim-ply behold such visions with a limited, human perspective. Instead,by beholding and deciphering the meaning of such visions in a processof spiritual exegesis, they reach divine truths. This type of elevatedexegesis becomes possible for qualified adepts at the end of their spiri-tual voyage, when human and divine perspectives correspond.The analysis above has also demonstrated how these mysticalnotions are formulated and expressed in Hekhalot and Merkavahmysticism through mythological language. Myth and mysticism aretwo conceptual frameworks which have no inherent connection. Someschools of mysticism present their ideas and beliefs through use ofvarious modes of expression other than mythology. Other schools,however, evoke mythological elements in their teachings in variousways. As chapters 4 and 5 have demonstrated, several Hekhalot andMerkavah accounts express mystical notions by utilizing mythologicallanguage, pictorial images, visual metaphors, and concrete illustra-tions. Echoes from familiar ancient Near Eastern mythological tradi-"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Literary, Phenomenological, Cultural, and Social Implications141tions, biblical and Mesopotamian, are likewise prominent. We find thepresence of mythology particularly in relation to two topics: the spiri-tual journey to God, and visions of the divine in the heavenly realm.The journey is delineated on two levels. It is presented as a men-tal-contemplative process, or a spiritual-ecstatic voyage, which takesplace in the adepts’ imagination, spirit, and mind. Such an experienceis depicted often in a tangible fashion as an actual, corporeal ascent toheaven taking place in a mythological, celestial cosmos. The act ofcrossing conceptual boundaries and gaining a divine-like awareness isexpressed through several mythological patterns and specific themesrooted in Near Eastern mythological sources. These include an heroicjourney to the forbidden divine realms, an ascent to heaven on a cos-mic pole, a symbolic return to the primordial, harmonious state ofEden, entrances through heaven’s gates, and various tests and trials.The spiritual shift of awareness is presented in several Hekhalot andMerkavah descriptions by applying a common mythical pattern ofsymbolic death and rebirth and by evoking a model of metamorphosisfrom a human status to a divine-like state.The complex concept of God, attained by the descenders to theMerkavah, is likewise portrayed on two levels. Varying descriptionsallude to God’s spiritual character, his transcendent nature, and hisinconceivable qualities, all far beyond human or angelic comprehen-sion. These abstract dimensions of God are expressed through mytho-logical, concrete imagery. God of the Hekhalot and Merkavah is aking, huge in body and size, draped in regal garments and wearing aroyal crown. He sits on his glorious throne in his royal seventh palacewhile other divine beings praise him, glorify his name, and accept hisrule in unison. These essentially anthropomorphic, figurative portray-als do not contradict an abstract conception of a transcendent, spiri-tual God. Rather, they express this abstract concept in a mythologicalfashion through the application of pictorial images and metaphoricallanguage, as well as by evoking traditional Near Eastern conventionalthemes such as enormous physical size, exclusive kingship, excep-tional beauty and tangible supremacy.Such revelations of the divine are not presented in isolation. They aredependent upon the adepts’ spiritual comprehension and exegesis. Theconcrete, anthropomorphic figure of God is revealed to qualified adeptsonly at the end of their spiritual journey. Then, when the Merkavah devo-tees reach an optimal mystical stage of consciousness, their human per-ception coincides with that of the divine. They can behold visions of God,gaze at the King in his beauty, and decipher the meaning of these revela-tions with “an understanding of the heart.” Thus, they comprehend God’sessence and speak of his spiritual and inconceivable nature, conveying itin abstract images such as spirit and soul."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"142Beholders of Divine SecretsIn this mythological formulation of mystical notions, it is importantto note that mythical images and themes are not presented in theiroriginal form in Hekhalot and Merkavah mystical writings. They areinteriorized, spiritualized, and reintegrated through distinctive mysticallenses in order to convey new mystical notions in the Judaism of lateantiquity. The mythological themes, however, are not interpreted ordecoded in light of the traditional Jewish midrashic or symbolic meth-ods, frequently used in rabbinical literature or in later Kabbalistic sources.Instead, in many of the Hekhalot and Merkavah accounts mythologicalthemes are presented directly as an integral and vital part of the mys-tical content. They give expression to mystical notions such as spiritualexperiences and transcendent revelations, which by their nature maystand beyond clear verbal expression and familiar vocabulary.CULTURAL AND SOCIAL IMPLICATIONSAs we have seen in chapter 1, various questions concerning the socialclimate in which Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism developed, as wellas the identity of its authors and redactors, and their specific ideologicalaffinities, are still questions debated by scholars. The fictional enigmaticand pseudepigraphic nature of the Hekhalot and Merkavah literaturedoes not offer clear information.1 Well-known Tannaitic figures such asRabbi Ishmael, Rabbi Akiva, and Rabbi Nehunia ben Ha-Kanah, arepresented in the writings as the main protagonists. Yet, as J. Dan ob-serves, the descriptions often refer to an imaginary reality. Likewise,they repeatedly contradict both historical information and the acceptedtraditional norms of the first few centuries C.E.2As discussed above, several theories have been suggested in thescholarly literature concerning the social and historical origin of theHekhalot literature as well as its writers’ possible affiliations. Accord-ing to one view, introduced by G. Scholem, Hekhalot and Merkavahmysticism emerged in the central circles of rabbis, in a context com-mitted to knowledge of rabbinic law and lore, namely, the tannaim andamoraimof the first centuries C.E.3This view has been challenged by D.J. Halperin, who demonstrates differences between the Hekhalot andMerkavah tradition and that of rabbinic Judaism. In his opinion, theHekhalot and Merkavah literature developed in lower-class groups ofpeople known as Am ha-Arets (people of the land,), who oper-ated in a context of social conflict with the rabbis, and expressed theirprotest through the literature.4 According to R. Elior, the writers of theHekhalot and Merkavah literature identify themselves with the priestlyclass of the first centuries C.E. After the destruction of the temple in 70 C.E.,these groups continued their priestly tradition within their visionaryexperiences in the heavenly palaces, in order to preserve and reconstruct"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Literary, Phenomenological, Cultural, and Social Implications143lost Temple traditions.5 P. Schäfer sees Hekhalot and Merkavah literatureas a product of a “post-Rabbinic elite” dating from the late Talmudicperiod to the late Gaonic era.6 M. Cohen, P. S. Alexander, and M. Swartzhave suggested that the different Hekhalot texts took shape over severalcenturies in Palestine in the early Amoraic period to the post-Talmudictime in Babylonia.7 The authors, according to Swartz, came from edu-cated, yet popular groups deprived of formal rabbinic training, found incircles of synagogue functionaries, liturgical poets, and professional scribes.J. R. Davila, likewise, associates professional scribes with the composersof the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature. In a recent study he identifiesthe people behind the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature as practitionersof ritual power, compared to shamans and shamans/healers.8As I conclude this study, I would like to consider these debatedquestions regarding the cultural-social background of Hekhalot andMerkavah mysticism in light of the literary, phenomenological evi-dence discussed above. R. Gimello, in his discussion of mysticism,highlights the significance of historical-cultural factors on every mys-tical tradition, asserting that mystical content and cultural-social fac-tors are bound together:Mysticism is inextricably bound up with, dependent upon,and usually subservient to the deeper beliefs and values ofthe traditions, cultures, and historical milieu which harborit. As it is thus intricately and intimately related to thosebeliefs and values, so must it vary according to them.9Mystical literature, S. T. Katz has attested, is rooted in its particularcultural circumstances and grounded in its specific historical context.Thus, it reflects both phenomenological characteristics and historical-cultural aspects:. . . as language and judgment also belong to, indeed areinseparable from, social life, the structural matrix works tolocate both experience and the experiencer (the mystic) in agiven sociohistoric conceptual field, whose problems andproblematic he or she adopts and aims to solve.10Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism, like other mystical traditions, isan historical phenomenon. As such, its literary traditions and imagerypoint beyond themselves, reflecting not only a spiritual-mental stanceand phenomenological dispositions but also, indirectly, cultural and socialideologies, norms, and attitudes. It appears worthwhile, thus, to at-tempt to reconstruct the ideologies of Hekhalot and Merkavah mysti-cism based on the literary evidence discussed above. This is by nomeans to suggest that such sources are to be treated as straightforwardand accurate historical documents but rather to propose that they reflectthe self-perception of the authors, redactors, and practitioners of Hekhalot"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"144Beholders of Divine Secretsand Merkavah mysticism, as well as their value systems and ideologi-cal affinities.Such observations, regarding self-perception, ideology, and valuesystems, may associate this mystical literature and its writers with anidentified group in the Jewish society of late antiquity. In what follows,I will outline specific perspectives found in Hekhalot and Merkavahmysticism. In light of these I will suggest that a specific group in Jewishsociety, that of “scribe, sages, and the wise” who were associated withclasses of priests, may have been the authors of this mystical literature.PERSPECTIVES IN HEKHALOT AND MERKAVAH MYSTICISMSeveral observations emerge from the Hekhalot and Merkavah mysti-cal sources regarding the outlooks of its authors and members of theMerkavah group.First, the descenders to the Merkavah are associated with tradi-tional Jewish teachings, culture, ethics and conventional forms of study.The main visionaries, as noted above, are identified as esteemedtannaitic sages whose traditional scholarly knowledge is very appar-ent. Furthermore, as various examples attest, a capable descender tothe Merkavah is portrayed as a highly educated and qualified person,fully trained in Jewish law, ethics, lore, and the study and Jewishexegesis of the Torah. Members of the Merkavah circles, as Elior hasdemonstrated recently, were closely affiliated with temple angelic-priestly traditions, literature, and rituals, which were refashioned andtransformed in the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature.11Second, despite the emphasis on rabbinic education and tradition,several aspects of Merkavah mysticism stand in tension with aspectsof rabbinic Judaism. Several scholars have argued that because theauthors of the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature did not retain a rec-ognized status and an esteemed position, they probably stood outsideofficial rabbinic groups.12 In addition, there are indications of concep-tual dissimilarity between traditional rabbinic notions and Hekhalotand Merkavah mysticism. Primary illustrations are attitudes towardsthe concepts of revelation and communication with God. A centralnotion in traditional Judaism defines the relationship between Godand human beings around the divinely initiated revelation at Sinaiand its continuous manifestation in the Torah, which embodies every-thing relevant for understanding the world and God. This traditionalview is substituted in Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism with an al-ternative religious option which emphasizes personal, mystical en-counters with God and the heavenly realm, initiated by humans.13Third, the notion of deciphering divine revelations and compre-hending attained visions is emphasized in Hekhalot and Merkavahmysticism, as we have seen. With “light in their heart and a face shining"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Literary, Phenomenological, Cultural, and Social Implications145from wisdom,” the Merkavah adepts wish to realize the content of God’ssecrets,14 as well as to decode all the mysteries of the world and all theorders of nature, as the Creator himself, so that “there is nothing inheaven above or deep within the earth concealed from them.”15Fourth, great value is attributed to written documents which con-tain the teachings of the Hekhalot and Merkavah mystics, as well asto the acts of recording and transmitting distinct knowledge to mem-bers of the circle. The significance of additional varying “scribal” fea-tures are likewise noticeable. A passage in Hekhalot Rabbati, for example,describes how divine visions and celestial revelations are attained by“those who descend to the Merkavah,” and their content are recordedby people whose proficient skill and role are to witness these visionsand to transcribe them in writing:These are the people whom the descenders to theMerkavah take and situate above them; they seat them(these people) before them and say to them: “Observe,see, hear, and write all that we say and all that we hearbefore the throne of glory.”16Similar scribal activity is demonstrated as well by the act of recordingthe secret names of the guards of the seventh heaven. These names arerecorded by individuals who seem to be scribes of mystical knowl-edge, as Rabbi Nehunia ben Ha-Kanah’s instructions attest:Since you say to me: detail (the names) come and stand onyour feet; And when the name of each one is pronouncedfrom my mouth, every one of you should bow down andfall down on your faces. Immediately all the heroes of thehavurah, heroes of the Torah, and all the mighty men of theyeshiva came and stood on their feet before Rabbi Nehuniaben Ha-Kanah. And he would speak, and they would fallon their faces, and the scribes would write.17Merits of the worthy mystic, who has proven himself in the study ofTorah, Rabbinic exegesis, and ethical deeds are recorded in writing byGabriel, the angelic scribe, and attached to the ascending wagon:Dumi’el needs Gabri’el, the scribe and he writes for him ona paper of the wagon of that person, saying: “such is thewisdom of this person and such are his deeds and he re-quests to enter before the throne of glory.18A reference to a textual document which contains secret knowledgeis associated with the Enoch tradition. In 3 Enoch, Enoch realizes divinesecrets through the act of reading “letters by which heaven and earth,seas and rivers, mountains and hills, trees and grasses, stars and con-stellations, angels, all heavenly creatures, throne of glory, the world"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"146Beholders of Divine Secretswisdom,” and all other phenomena were created.19 A written documentfacilitates the transmission of knowledge. Thus, Enoch-Metatron medi-ates hidden knowledge to his disciple, Rabbi Ishmael, by instructinghim to read the letters of the heavenly curtain: “he showed them to bewith his fingers, like a father teaching his son the letters of the Torah.”20The opening passage of Hekhalot Rabbati introduces a book whichcontains knowledge of the seven celestial divine palaces and of theseventy holy names of God: “This is [the] book [of] [the] seven sacredpalaces, in which seventy sacred names are explained.”21 An emphasison learning secret knowledge from a written book is found, as well, inHekhalot Zutarti:Everyone who is careful with this book and purifies himself,he is loved by angels, er ’elim, troops, Seraphim, Cherubim,Ophanim, and the throne of glory.22Reference is made to a written text that includes the secrets of theperception of God and divine mysteries. This text is attributed to Moseswho is presented in this context as both an ideal mystic and scribewho mediates between Heaven and Earth and reveals transcribedhidden knowledge to the selected members of the Merkavah circle:This is the book of wisdom, understanding, and perception,the study of above and below, the secrets of the Torah andof heaven and of earth, and the secrets, which He gave toMoses, son of ’Amram, of the perception of YH YH AH’HYHYAW Sabaot God of Israel.23A description in Hekhalot Rabbati, discussed previously, demonstratesas well the process of transmitting esoteric teachings to the membersof the Merkavah group, identified as the havurah or yeshiva. WhenRabbi Nehunia ben Ha-Kanah decides to reveal “the secret of the worldas it appears to one who is worthy to gaze at the king and on thethrone in its glory and beauty,”24 he instructs Rabbi Ishmael, his stu-dent, to bring before him the people who belong to this circle, namely,“all the heroes of the havurah and all the mighty men of the yeshiva.”25Hekhalot Rabbati depicts as well the manner in which traditional andesoteric knowledge is transmitted from a master teacher to his disciples.Rabbi Nehunia ben Ha-Kanah explains the process to Rabbi Akiva:I have put in your mouth Torah, Prophets, and Writings;Mishna, and Midrash of laws and legends, the legal deci-sions of the permissible and the forbidden. Yet were it notfor the secrets of Torah which I have hidden from you, wouldyou come and appear before me at all?26Also of importance is the portrayal of both Moses and Enoch asprototypes of the Merkavah mystics, as demonstrated above. Both heroic"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Literary, Phenomenological, Cultural, and Social Implications147figures from the past are traditionally known as “scribal” ancestors. Enochwas known by the third century B.C.E. to have been a “scribe of righteous-ness” (1 Enoch 12:4 4QEnGiants 8:1–4, ii.14–15), who ascended to heavenin order to transcribe the angelic appeal (1 Enoch 13:4–7). Moses is knownas the one who has written God’s words at Sinai and other occasions, andthus transcribed the Torah of Moses (Ex. 24:4; Num. 33:2; Deut. 31:9, 22).In the second century B.C.E., this tradition was supplemented by the com-pilers of the book of Jubilees, who emphasized Moses’ scribal role: “Andthe angel of the presence spoke to Moses by the word of the Lord saying,‘Write the whole account of creation . . .’ ” (2:1) Moses scribal descenders,then, transmitted his knowledge in a transcribed book.27At the same timecentral Hekhalot and Merkavah heroes, such as Enoch and Rabbi Ishmael,are identified as priests and associated with priestly traditions, rituals andduties, and many literary examples of the Hekhalot and Merkavah litera-ture reveal specific priestly traditions and interests from the First and theSecond temple periods, as Elior has attested.Fifth, an additional aspect of Hekhalot and Merkavah literature isthe capacity to express mystical notions through the reapplication andappropriation of biblical and ancient Mesopotamian mythologicalthemes. Affinities with the language of the mystery cults is also sug-gested by specific descriptions. The presence of biblical traditions inHekhalot mysticism is obvious. Mesopotamian mythological motifsand the language of pagan cults, however, are elements which seemto suggest a certain familiarity with non-Jewish traditions operatingwithin the Greco-Roman world of late antiquity, as well as the capac-ity to draw on the symbolic power of such far removed traditions.In light of the evidence presented above, we can discern severaldistinctions among the Hekhalot and Merkavah mystical group, asfound in their mystical records. The descenders to the chariots aredepicted as members of a specific circle of learning, who regard writtenrecords not only as primary sources for knowledge, but also as chan-nels through which teachings are transcribed and transmitted. Theyare portrayed as highly educated and trained in Jewish traditionaldisciplines, scriptures, rabbinical texts, and interpretations. This groupis associated, as well, with priestly temple traditions, ritual and litera-ture which they both transform and continue. Members of this cul-tured circle, however, not only show interest in the normative teachingsand principles of Judaism, but they also see themselves as initiatorsand recipients of direct divine visions. Much of their practice, more-over, revolves around interpreting and deciphering these mystical rev-elations as they aim to comprehend their encoded concealed meanings.They also attribute their knowledge to esteemed teachers and models,such as Moses and Enoch, regarded as scribes, priests, sages, and me-diators between Heaven and Earth. Like them, the Merkavah adepts"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"148Beholders of Divine Secretsaspire to access divine secrets and then to record and transmit thesemysteries to other members of their circle. The manner in which sev-eral of these notions are expressed in the Hekhalot and Merkavahliterature, through utilizing themes from foreign sources, suggests acertain awareness of non-Jewish traditions and proficiency in evokingsuch traditions in a new mystical context.What kind of a social-cultural group emerges from these descrip-tions and what is its ideological affiliation? I would like to suggest thatmany of the characteristics attributed to members of the Hekhalot andMerkavah mystical circle are shared by other specific groups recognizedby titles such as scribes, sages, and wise men associated with classes ofpriests and with temple traditions. Many of the Hekhalot and Merkavahmystical accounts, likewise, appear to be laced with several features,ideologies, and traditions, associated with distinct concerns of severaldisciplines of such groups, namely, visionary sages, scribes, or scribes-priests who embrace the pursuit of transcendent divine mysteries andrevelations. The following discussion aims to support this hypothesis.PERSPECTIVES OF SCRIBES, SCHOLARS AND THE WISEStudying the changes brought about in Judaism as a result of Helle-nistic influence, E. J. Bickerman has observed a complex view of lateantiquity Jewish society which reflects the existence of different groupsof intellectual experts. Bickerman has discerned a stratified system ofintellectual circles, placed between the highest rank of the rabbinicalelite and the lowest, that of the common class. “Between and besidethe nobles and the common people there had always existed groupsof technological experts whose power was based on knowledge.”28As several scholars have submitted, the designated titles of suchJewish intellectual groups of late antiquity are not rigidly used. Scribes,sages, scholars, wise men are synonymous and fluid titles, distinguish-ing members of such circles. The evidence for their activities is sparse,scattered, and open to various interpretations.29 Scribes-sages wereneither organized in groups nor did they serve in distinctive identifiableclasses of specialists, A. J. Saldarini has asserted.30 Their status andsocial classes varied. Likewise, the range of functions and roles theyperformed was considerably broad. Records describe scribes-sages,scholars, wise men as associated with priests, Levities, prominent fami-lies, as well as with lower class officials.31 In addition to their role aspart of the administration, independent scribes-sages in different loca-tions functioned in a wide range of disciplines and expertise. Theywere known as teachers and textual specialists, and were involved inwriting, reading, and producing documents. Scribes-sages were thusknown also as experts of the scriptures and the laws, skills whichthey acquired through reading, coping, and interpreting."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Literary, Phenomenological, Cultural, and Social Implications149Several classes of scribes were also associated with classes of priestsas their roles and traditions overlapped at various times, as several ofsources attests. In Mesopotamia from the ar millennium BCE on, scribeswere situated in royal courts and temples and were associated withpriestly classes, among other positions. Scribal literary culture andtraditions were also a phenomenon associated with schools of priestsand those who trained in priestly circles in Israel, according to sourcesincluded in the Hebrew Bible. Fishbane has demonstrated the diffi-culty of distinguishing priests, scribes, prophets and other leaders whoproduced and transmitted the biblical books. Studies of Deuteronomy,edited probably before and during the exile, emphasize its priestlyscholastic character and connection with wisdom and Scribal tradi-tions. In the post exilic Jewish community the roles of priests, Levitiesand scribes clearly overlapped. The most well-known scribe, Ezra is ofa high priestly stock. Representing undoubtedly the blending of priestlyand Scribal traditions he is depicted as a “scribe skilled in the law ofMoses” (Ezra 7:6, 11, 12, 21). Great Scribal activity is attributed topriests and Levities according the Chroniclers depiction (1 Chro. 24:6,2 Chro. 34:13). The Testament of Levi, an apocalyptic work of the secondcenturyBCE, is ascribed to the predecessor of a priestly lineage, em-phasizing the priestly and Levitecal descent of the scribes (8:17 possi-bly 13:1–2). Enoch, depicted as a scribe in 1 Enoch and 4QEn Giants, isthe central hero of the Enochic priestly tradition. Priestly origin isattributed as well to scribes who composed and copied texts foundamong the Dead Sea Scrolls that speak of a community of the “Sonsof Zadok”. In addition to specialization in the copying of books andsacred scrolls several groups also drew on secular written documents.Various sources attribute to sages, scribes and “the wise” an attitudeof openness to foreign, non-Jewish traditions. Some scribe-sages werealso associated with knowledge and wisdom; they were depicted asseers, wise men and seem both to continue and to transform familiarNear Eastern traditions of mantic wisdom.32Only several concerns of the sages and scribes, as described above,are relevant to our present discussion of Hekhalot and Merkavah mys-ticism and its background. These include an appreciation of scholarshipand of transmitting acquired knowledge through written documentsand books; extensive education in traditional Jewish scriptures, wis-dom, lore, and interpretation; affiliation and devotion to priestly templetraditions; familiarity with foreign, non-Jewish traditions, and specificinterest in decoding, and interpreting concealed divine secrets. As avariety of sources attest, specific circles of Jewish intellectuals of lateantiquity, associated with Near Eastern traditions of scribal wisdom,demonstrate such interests and approaches. The Hekhalot and Merkavahaccounts, likewise, associate its mystics with these concerns, as we have"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"150Beholders of Divine Secretsseen, and thus may point to some ideological affinity with the formergroup of intellectuals, scribes, and sages.The first three interests of these sages-scribes, namely appreciation ofscholarship, knowledge and written documents, the dedication to exten-sive Jewish education as well as the connection to priestly traditions andliterature, have been intensively discussed in various studies.33 Thus thediscussion below will examine the latter concepts, namely, the familiaritywith foreign, non-Jewish traditions and, more extensively, the specificinterest in decoding and interpreting concealed divine secrets.Various sources attribute to the sages and scribes an attitude ofopenness to their neighboring non-Jewish traditions, in accord witha long tradition associated with the learned activity of “the wise.”This attitude, which can be identified in early stages of the history ofancient Israel,34 is documented in several sources from the Greco-Roman period, which demonstrate that knowledge of the Torah andas well of non-Jewish types of wisdom was important for Jewishscribal groups. For example, Ben Sira’s portrayal of the ideal sageemphasizes study of the Torah and abiding by the commandmentsas a primary goal (Sir 6:37, 23:27, 29:11–13). Nonetheless, Ben Siraalso accentuates the need not to separate from foreign cultures andto be open to other traditions. Ben Sira’s ideal scribe-sage, for example,must be ready to travel to foreign places: “. . . he will travel in the landsof foreign peoples for he has tested the good things and bad amonghuman beings” (Sir 39:4 Greek).35 Tolerance of other cultures, customs,and traditions is likewise encouraged: “Eat like a man the things setbefore you” (Sir 31:16a Greek); “Should they choose you to preside overa feast, become among them as one of them (32:1 Greek). ObservingBen-Sira’s view, J. Gammie suggests: “It is most probably due to hissecular tasks as scholar, sage, and jurist that the necessity of a morecosmopolitan and assimilationist stance was thrust upon him.”36Ben-Sira’s profile of the ideal scribe is not unique. Daniel, in thebook of Daniel, is a Babylonian scribe, familiar with foreign traditionand with the pagan literature of the Chaldeans (1:4). The Letter ofAristeas to Philocrates, a pseudonymous Greek-Jewish composition,shows a similar attitude when presenting characteristics of the sev-enty-two translators, commissioned by the Egyptian king to producea Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible: “. . . they had not only mas-tered Jewish literature, but had made a serious study of that of theGreeks as well” (L. Arist, 121).37These educated sages are clearly ac-quainted with both Jewish and non-Jewish traditions and with othertraditional views: “They rose above conceit and contempt for otherpeople and instead engaged in discourse and listening to and answer-ing each and every one . . .” (L. Arist, 121). In her discussion of theJewish scribes in Greco-Roman times, C. Schams clarifies this phe-"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Literary, Phenomenological, Cultural, and Social Implications151nomenon: “Scribes who during their training would have copied dif-ferent texts, wisdom books, and sacred writings as the classical texts,would have gained some knowledge of the content of these books.Since the sacred books were considered a source of wisdom, they werestudied by educated and wise scholars.”38An additional specific concern of the scribes, sages, and intellectu-als of late antiquity is their distinct interest in the notion of decodingand interpreting veiled divine mysteries. This interest follows well-knowntraditions associated with scribes and sages dating from ancient timesuntil late antiquity, which are expressed in striking terminological andconceptual similarities.39According to Mesopotamian sources, for ex-ample, a special kind of knowledge associated with the wisdom of thescribes, enables one to acquire divine understanding and to know thesecrets of Heaven and Earth. Such knowledge is attributed to excep-tional humans and especially to successful kings.40 Ashurbanipal (668–627B.C.E.), for instance, left an account of how he obtained such wisdomthrough the art of the scribes. “I learned the wisdom of Nabu, I studiedall the scribal craft . . .” he claims, and gives specific details:Marduk, the wisest of the Gods, gave me wide understand-ing and extensive intelligence and Nabu, the scribe [whoknows] everything granted me his wise teachings....Ilearned the art of the Sage, Adapa, [so that now] I am famil-iar with the secret storehouse of all scribe learning [includ-ing] the celestial and terrestrial portents.41Nabonidus (555–539B.C.E.) describes himself as a learned man who pos-sesses knowledge and wisdom and thus is able to understand secret lore:I am wise, I am learned, I have seen what is hidden; I do notunderstand the impressions made by a stylus [but] I haveseen secret things; the god Ilte’i has shown me everything.I have found out [secret lore].42As we have seen in chapter 4 above, the fragmentary cuneiform textfrom Mesopotamia associates King Enmeduranki of Sippar with thetradition of deciphering divine secrets. Endowed with knowledgeassociated with methods of divination, the ancient king is able to in-terpret omens, to comprehend the mysteries of the gods, and the se-crets of Heaven and the underworld. Letters by scholar-scribes to theneo-Assyrian Kings Esaehaddon and Ashurbanipal demonstrate a simi-lar claim to understanding celestial and terrestrial signs, including awide range of cosmological observations.43The sages and scribes of Mesopotamia produced and copied cu-neiform literature over a long period of time, from the middle of thefirst millennium B.C.E. well into the Greco-Roman period. As notedabove, their tradition continued beyond Mesopotamia throughout the"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"152Beholders of Divine Secretschanging political and social scenery of the Near East and into theHellenistic period.44 Hellenistic Jewish cultures absorbed much of theculture of Mesopotamia, including various scribal traditions, as seen inseveral apocalyptic sources.45 One example of this phenomenon is theEnochic tradition. As studies have shown, the figure of Enoch is mod-eled after that of the Mesopotamian King Enmeduranki.46 The Enochtradition does not continue the tradition of divination, yet it maintainsa deep interest in the notion of encoding divine mysteries, as J. J. Collinsmakes clear. Emphasizing the link of Enochic tradition to the scribesand sages, Collins asserts: “The books of Enoch often speak of a classof the “righteous and chosen,” and Enoch, the righteous scribe, must beconsidered as their prototype. We know regrettably little about thisEnochic group . . . they were, or at least included in their number, scribeswho were familiar with the name of Enoch.”47 It is important, however,to note the different perspective of the Jewish scribes-sages. As Collinsaffirms: “They also claimed to know divine mysteries and boasted of anancient prototype who had ascended to heaven. They were influencedby their Babylonian counterparts in some respects.. . . In accordancewith Jewish tradition, they rejected most methods of divination andomen seeking.. . . For the decoding of these mysteries, however, theJewish sages relied not primarily on divinatory techniques but on whatthey believed to be divine revelation.”48The principal characteristics of Enoch in the Enochic tradition arethe marks of a scribe-sage figure, who is familiar with both traditionalwisdom and the wisdom of decoding divine secrets.49 The primarynarrative describing Enoch, the Book of the Watchers (1–36) introduceshim as “Enoch the scribe,” or “Enoch the scribe of righteousness” (12:3-4). His role is to mediate between the angels in Heaven and the fallenangels, or watchers, on Earth, and to “write out for them the record ofa petition” (13:4). The opening of the last part of 1 Enoch, the Epistle ofEnoch, introduces Enoch as the wise scribe of this book, “[Book] five,which is written by Enoch, the writer of all the signs of wisdom amongall the people” (92:1).In the Book of Giants, included as part of theEnochic writings at Qumran, Enoch ‘s scribal skills are associated withhis ability of interpreting dreams.50Concern with encoded divine wisdom and its interpretation is cen-tral to the apocalyptic Enoch tradition. In the Book of the Watchers, Enochtravels beyond the boundaries of the Earth, enters inaccessible places,and understands mysteries and cosmological secrets. In the AstronomicalBook (72–82), the angel Uriel interprets the meaning of divine mysteries,and becomes the source of knowledge. Enoch’s statement in the Apoca-lypse of Weeks makes this clear: “That which appeared to me in theheavenly vision, and I know from the words of the holy angels andunderstand from heavenly revelation” ( 93:2). Mysteries written on the"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Literary, Phenomenological, Cultural, and Social Implications153celestial tablet of heaven are also revealed to him: “For I know thismystery. I have read the tablets of heaven and have seen the holy writ-ings and I have understood the writings in them” (103:2).51The Book of Daniel demonstrates a similar interest in the wisdomof decoding divine secrets, associated with scribes, sages, and intellec-tual circles.52 Daniel is a maskil.53 He and his companions are educatedas Babylonian scribes who study the letters and language of theChaldeans (1:4) and are known as “the wise men of Babylon (2:13).Daniel, who “studied the books ( 9:2) is distinguished not only by hisskills in all wisdom but also by his knowledge and loyalty to Jewishtradition and law. There is an emphasis on writing books and on thesignificance of the intellectuals (maskilim), who constitute the religiousleadership of Judaism (chap. 12).Daniel is introduced into the meaning of mysteries. The idea ofwisdom encoded in mysterious signs is prominent in chapters 1–6.Chapters 7–12 display the notion of divine revelations, which requirecomprehension and interpretation. Daniel becomes a recipient of dreamsand visions. He receives a vision near the bank of waters in Babylon(10:4), sees a fiery heavenly figure, and falls down to the ground withterror (10:9). He is then raised by this figure, who grants him under-standing of the prophet Jeremiah’s oracle, treated as a mysterious revela-tion (10: 11–14). Daniel falls dumb and trembles until the divine beingcalms him down and an entity “like a a man” touches him and promisesto reveal to him the meanings of prophecies that “were inscribed in thetrue writing” (10:21). Daniel is now able to understand and interpret thehidden messages of the revelations (9, 11, 12:10, 11:33, 35).54 As a di-vinely inspired sage, Daniel becomes a seer of mysteries who mediatesbetween the divine and his contemporary generation.55Ben Sira restricts his ideal sage to the Torah, advising him not tosearch for hidden knowledge: “Search not for what is too wondrousfor you and investigate not what is hidden from you. Mediate uponwhat is permitted to you and deal not with secret things” (Sir 3:20–22).Despite this prohibition, it is evident that Ben Sira is aware of suchintellectual pursuits of wonders and hidden knowledge, as scholarshave argued.56 A similar well-known Mishnahic prohibition expressesreservations regarding esoteric wisdom, yet allows one who is learnedand intelligent to study the secret knowledge of Ma’aseh Merkavah:57It is forbidden for three persons to discuss the laws of sexualoffenses, for two people to discuss Ma’aseh Bereshit, and fora single person to discus Ma’aseh Merkavah, unless [thatperson] is learned and intelligent (m. Hagigah 2:1).4 Ezra is an additional source which displays an interest in decod-ing divine secrets associated with scribes and sages.58 The text depicts"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"154Beholders of Divine SecretsEzra as a priest and a scribe who is the author of the twenty-four booksof the Hebrew Bible and seventy others, reserved only for the wise. Al-though Ezra “has never gone down into the deep, and neither ascendedinto the heavens” (4 Ezra 4:7–9), his interest in esoteric knowledge is clear,and is understood to be the source for his deep understanding of revela-tions and visions. Invited by God to reproduce the Law, Ezra receivesdivine revelations as well as a special understanding and wisdom:Then I opened my mouth and behold, a full cup was offeredto me; it was full of something like water, but its color waslike fire. And I took and drank; and when I has drunk it, myheart poured forth understanding, and wisdom increased inmy breast, and my spirit retained its memory, and my mouthwas open and was no longer closed (39–40).In2 Baruch,the tradition of decoding secrets and revelations isalso linked to the wisdom of the scribes and sages.59 Baruch, the scribefrom the book of Jeremiah, is portrayed as a leader of the communitywho is involved with tradition and law. As a wise man (46:4) he in-structs the people to observe the Torah and its laws (44:2–3, 45:1–2,85:3), and writes to the exiles in Babylon (77:11–87). In addition, Baruchis concerned with visions and revelations which he receives throughdreams (36:1, 53:1), and with interpretations which reveal eschatologicalinformation: “And while I was pondering these and similar things,behold, Ramael, the angel who is set over true visions, was sent to meand he said to me” (55:3).It is interesting to find in Josephus’Jewish War a reference to scribesand their interest in interpreting mysteries. Recounting events whichtook place towards the end of the first revolt in 70 C.E., Josephus intro-duces a list of omens and signs which had supposedly occurred beforethe outbreak of the war. These omens are linked with predictions of thedownfall of Jerusalem. In Josephus’ view, correct interpretation of theomens was crucial: “By the inexperienced, this was regarded as a goodomen, but by the sacred scribes it was at once interpreted in accordancewith other events” (War 6.291). Josephus does not elaborate on the iden-tity, background, and status of the group he names as sacred scribes. Itis clear, however, that they are seen as learned and experienced inter-preters of signs who are therefore able to predict the future.60Several documents of the Qumran community connect intellectualfigures such as the wise man, the sage, or the maskil to the notion ofdeciphering the meaning of hidden mysteries. “There is no evidencethat the sages of Qumran depended on dream visions or angelophaniesas the media of such revelation,” C. A. Newsom asserts. There are“repeated references, however, to revelations, the gift of a spirit ofknowledge, and inspired revelation, by which secrets and mysteriesare decoded.”61 Collins points out that the author of the Hodayot claims"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Literary, Phenomenological, Cultural, and Social Implications155to be the recipient of direct revelation. This is evident in the followinglines, attributed to the Teacher of Righteousness: “These things I knowby the wisdom which comes from Thee for Thou hast unstopped myears to marvelous mysteries”(1QH 1:21).62 Qumran Pesharim as welldemonstrates an interest in revelation and interpretation.63 Words ofthe scriptures are treated as mysteries which reveal information aboutsupernatural realms, divine mysteries, and God’s plan for humansalvation at the end of time. These need special interpretation, di-vinely disclosed to the elect. Lines from the Rule of the Communitydemonstrate clearly the claim for understanding esoteric wisdom: “Myeyes have gazed on that which is eternal, on wisdom concealed frommen, on knowledge and wise design [hidden] from the sons of men”(1QS 5–6).64 The source for such concealed wisdom, however, is the willof God made evident through proper understanding of the Torah.65SHARED PERSPECTIVE INDEED?Several of the principal concerns of the sage and scribe groups de-scribed above are significant to our discussion of Hekhalot and Merkavahmysticism and its background. These include: appreciation of scholar-ship and of transmitting acquired knowledge through written docu-ments; dedication to extensive education in traditional Jewish scriptures,wisdom, lore, and interpretation; affiliation and devotion to priestlytemple traditions, rituals and literature; familiarity with foreign, non-Jewish traditions which operated within the Greco-Roman world of lateantiquity, and capacity to evoke their symbolic themes; finally, specificinterest in decoding and interpreting concealed divine secrets. Thoughthese identifying elements are not the dominant characteristics of allJewish intellectuals of late antiquity, they do represent interests of specificcircles of sages and scribes associated with varying aspects of Jewisheducation as well as of non-Jewish traditions.We may note the transformation of such an interest in Hekhalot andMerkavah mysticism. The significance of understanding concealed mean-ings is clearly maintained. Rather than attributing such wisdom solely todivine inspiration or to an angelic illumination, Hekhalot and Merkavahmysticism seems to narrow the gap between exegesis and experience.66 Itemphasizes the cultivated mystical awareness, consciousness, and “un-derstanding of the heart” as keys to an exegetical understanding of con-cealed visions, as the opening of Hekhalot Zutarti cited above suggests:If you want to single yourself out in the worldso that the secrets of the worldand the mysteries of wisdom will be revealed to you,study this teaching and be careful with ituntil the day of your departure.Do not try to understand what lies behind you"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"156Beholders of Divine Secretsand do not investigate the words of your lips.You will try to understand what is in your heartand keep silent,so that you will attain the beauty of the Merkavah.67CONCLUSIONWe come now to the end of this study. The last part of our discussionhas attempted to identify the social-cultural background of Hekhalotand Merkavah mysticism, its authors, and redactors, in light of viewsand attitudes present in their mystical writings. As a concluding hy-pothesis to our analysis, we have examined how several importantattitudes and concerns, associated with the Hekhalot and Merkavahmystics, are also present as key interests among Jewish intellectuals inlate antiquity in circles of scribes, sages, and “the wise” from ancientto Greco-Roman times. We see several shared perspectives: attentionto education, scholarship and transmitting knowledge; proficiency intraditional Jewish scriptures, teachings, and interpretation; allegianceto priestly temple traditions, rituals and literature; certain familiaritywith foreign, non-Jewish traditions, and interest in decoding concealeddivine secrets. Though these are not precise social, historical, andcultural features which can equate the two groups with absoluteconfidence, they do seem to reflect a distinct similarity in self-percep-tion and ideological interests. Thus, it seems plausible to consider thatthe enigmatic Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism is a product of theseJewish intellectuals of late antiquity associated with classes of templepriests, who, in keeping with the traditions of the wise, reapply sev-eral of their principles and concepts to their mystical writings.These suggestions are presented as possibilities and not as certain-ties. They neither specifically define the group in which Hekhalot andMerkavah mysticism was compiled, nor do they identify its authorsand redactors with absolute confidence. Nonetheless they treat theinclinations of the writers as well as their cultural and social ideolo-gies. Together with the previous discussion of Hekhalot and Merkavahmysticism, both its special mystical notions and the manner in whichthey are conveyed through mythological forms of expression, as wellas through evoking and transforming Mesopotamian and biblicalmythological themes, these cultural and social references conclude thisstudy and thus address the last aspect of Rabbi Akiva’s question:Who is able to contemplate the seven palacesand behold the heaven of heavensand see the chambers of chambersand say: “I saw the chamber of YH?”68"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"157NotesCHAPTER 1: THE HEKHALOT AND MERKAVAH LITERATUREAND ITS MYSTICAL TRADITION1. The term “Merkavah” refers to the “celestial throne” described inseveral scriptural accounts, such as Daniel 7, Isaiah 6, and Ezekiel 1. Althoughthe term “Merkavah” is not mentioned in the first chapter of Ezekiel, in therabbinic literature the expression “ma’aseh merkavah” is used in reference tovarious interpretations of Ezekiel 1. See, for example, Mishna Hagigah 2: 1. Theearliest surviving use of “Merkavah” referring to Ezekiel’s vision is found inSirach 49: 8. On the relationship of the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature tointerpretations of Ezekiel see D. J. Halperin, The Faces of the Chariot: EarlyJewish Responses to Ezekiel’s Vision (Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 1988).2. For recent critical editions of individual Hekhalot and Merkavah textssee R.

Charlesworth (New York: Doubleday,1983), 1: 223–315; M. Cohen, The Shiur Qomah: Texts and Recensions (Tübingen:Mohr Siebeck, 1985).

Scholem considered Hekhalot Zutarti as the oldest textin the Hekhalot followed in chronological order by Hekhalot Rabbati, MerkavahRabbah,Ma’aseh Merkavah and 3 Enoch. These views were first challenged byE. E. Urbach, followed by Halperin, who argued for a later date. See E.

Green,Keter: The Crown of God in Early Jewish Mysticism (Princeton, NJ: PrincetonUniversity Press, 1997). Other scholars support this view and demonstratelinks between this literature and priestly as well as priestly-angelic traditionsfrom the last few centuries of the first millennium B. C. E and the middle ofSecond Temple period. See, I. Gruenwald, “The Impact of Priestly Traditionson the Creation of Merkavah Mysticism and the Shiur Komah,”JerusalemStudies in Jewish Thought 6: 1–2 (1987): 65–120 [Hebrew Section]; R. Elior, “FromEarthly Temple to Heavenly Shrine” 217–267; “The Merkavah Tradition,” 101–158;Temple and Chariot.16. In Scholem’s view, the tradition had emerged in Palestine among thedisciples of R. Yohanan ben Zakkai, during the first century C.E., after thedestruction of the Second Temple, and from there spread to Babylonia. SeeScholem,Major Trends, 41–47;Merkavah,7–8. The Talmudic scholar S. Liebermansupported these assertions. Close correspondence has been demonstrated byboth Scholem and Lieberman between the mystical accounts of the heavenlyascensions to the Merkavah in the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature and theTalmudic sections dealing with Ma’aseh Merkavah (The Work of the Chariot).See Lieberman, “Song of Songs,” published as an appendix in G. Scholem,Merkavah,118–126. According to Scholem and Lieberman, the rabbinichomilitical speculations of the “Four Who Entered the Pardes” in MishnahHagigah2: 1, as well as its various recensions and related traditions in thePalestinian and Babylonian Talmuds, have preserved within them echoes ofthe same mystical speculations and practices which are part of the Hekhalotand Merkavah literature.

Theparagraphs in the synoptic edition have been arranged in a synoptic manner,without imposing a final recension, using MS New York 8128 as a fictive basis.Schäfer’s explains his principles in several articles included in Hekhalot-Studien.The term “macroform” used by Schäfer in this context defines an individualwork of the Hekhalot and Merkavah and indicates its “fictive” or “ideal” formas well as its different manifestations in the various manuscripts. The termmicroform defines smaller units of work. Schäfer has not suggested a globaldate for the literature, but rather referred to different units. The Hekhalot Rabbatiis thought by him to be an earlier collection, and following it, in chronologicalorder, are Hekhalot Zutarti, Ma’aseh Merkavah, Merkavah Rabbah, and3 Enoch.33.

Nonetheless, according to the pre-vious section, 421–423, they are linked to both, the ability to “behold the workof his creator” (Synopse,421) and to the”ascent and descent of the chariot”(Synopse,422–423).

See, for example, Synopse,547 in which the vision of God and thecelestial realm is associated with prays, praises of God, and a purificationritual: “He said to him to Rabbi Ishmael: How can one behold them and seewhat does RWZYY YHWH do? Rabbi Akiva said to me: I prayed a prayer ofmercy and I was saved . . . and what what do I do and can behold them andsee what does RWZYY YHWH do?

See alsoHimmelfarb, “The Practice of Ascent,” 126–128;The Ascent to Heaven, 108 ff.;These scholars rightly observe that the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature alsointroduces magical-theurgic traditions and ritual practices to gain power, whichdo not pertain to the ascent to the Merkavah traditions but design to compelangels to descend from heaven to disclose to the mystics esoteric secrets ofTorah (Sar Torah Traditions). These traditions, which are not part of the Hekhalotand Merkavah literature mystical core, will not examined in this study.

See Scholem,Major Trends, 65–66. This understanding has been shared by Gruenwald, Apoca-lyptic and Merkavah, 94; Dan, “The Concept of Knowledge,” 70–71; Morray-Jones, “Transformational Mysticism, 2 ff.134. This view has been asserted, as well, by Scholem in several of hiswritings. See, for example, Major Trends, 64;On the Mystical Shape, 24.

From a different perspective schol-ars have suggested that the subject of the Shi’ur Komahfigurative descriptionis not God but rather a hypostatic angel. See G. G. Stroumsa, “Form(s) ofGod: Some Notes on Metatron and Christ,”HTR 76 (1983): 269–288; J. E.Fossum,The Name of God and the Angel of the Lord. The Origin of Intermediationin Gnosticism (Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 1985); Deuthch, The Gnostic Imagina-tion,99–105.135. For a very eloquent account of such views see Deutch, The GnosticImagination,80–153.136. Liberman, “Mishnat Shir ha-Shirim,” 118–126. This firm identificationofShiur Komah with Midrash Shir ha-Shirim has been been fully accepted byScholem. Other scholars such as M. Cohen, and D. Boyarin have rejected thistheory, which has also been called into question by Green. See Scholem, JewishGnosticism,36–40; Cohen, The Shi’ur Qomah, 1, 19; D. Boyarin, “Two Introduc-tions to the Midrash on Song of Songs,”Tarbiz 56 (1987): 479–500 [Hebrew];Green, Keter, 78–79, n. 3; “The Song of Song in Early Jewish Mysticism,”Orim:A Jewish Journal at Yale 2 (1987): 49–63.137. Prominent manifestations of this model are likewise found in 2 Enoch,entitled also the Slavonic Enoch or Book of the Secrets of Enoch. 2 Enoch 22: 1–3,for example, proclaims a figurative portrayal of God’s form, through whichhis concealed, incomprehensible nature is revealed: “And on the tenth heaven,Aravoth, I saw the view of the face of the Lord, like iron made burning hotin a fire and brought out, and it emits sparks an is incandescent. Thus, evenI saw the face of the Lord. But the face of the Lord is not to be talked about,it is so very marvelous and supremely awesome and supremely frightening.And who am I to give an account of the incomprehensible being of the Lord,and his face, so extremely strange and indescribable?” See F. I. Andersen “2(Slavonic Apocalypse of) Enoch” in J. H. Charlesworth, The Old TestamentPseudepigrapha,(Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1983), 1: 136. A parallel formu-lation is found in 2 Enoch 39: 1–6: “ . . . the lips of the Lord are a furnace offire . . . the face of the Lord, like iron made burning hot by a fire, emittingsparks . . . the eyes of the Lord, like rays of the shining sun and terrifyingthe eyes of a human being . . .
