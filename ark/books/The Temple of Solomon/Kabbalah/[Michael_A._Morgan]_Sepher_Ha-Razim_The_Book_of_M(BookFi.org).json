Recalling similar formulas from the Genizah collection and elsewhere, he began a detailed study of the preserved fragments of magical literature. He postulated that these fragments may have all come from a common source which could be reconstructed. His research led to the publication of Sepher Ha-Razim in 1966. The published text is eclectic. No single document available to Margalioth contained all of the material which was to appear in the final text. Enough was available, however, that he felt confident that he had successfully reconstructed a magical handbook from the early Talmudic period. Since its publication, SHR has proven a valuable source of information for studies pertaining to magic in antiquity and for studies relating to Jewish life in the first centuries CE. Margalioth was an excellent textual scholar. Even though additional texts have come to light since the publication of SHR, his original work is an exceptional piece of scholarship which demands wider circulation and use among scholars interested in the Judaisms of the Hellenistic age. No doubt a re-editing of SHR is needed in the future. For the present, I hope the scholarly community will find this annotated translation of the Margalioth text a valuable tool for further study."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"SEPHER HA-RAZIM Codices There were seven major codices available to Margalioth for the preparation of his text.

Latin Translation The Latin translation is titled Liber Razielis Angeli and is found in the Senate Library in Leipzig, Codex Latinus No. 745. Margalioth did not receive a copy of this manuscript until after the type had been set for the Hebrew edition. Consequently he refers to only a few places in it. Unlike the Arabic, the Latin is a free translation and adaptation which has been greatly expanded. Of the Hebrew codices, it is closest to D, whose editor claims to have used a Latin version. Other Sources Margalioth drew heavily upon many medieval collections of magical spells and formulas which he felt were descended from his postulated original. The most important of these are: 1.

STRUCTURE The text of SHR is divided into seven unequal sections preceeded by a preface which contains a description of the book's transmission and functions. Before the flood, it was presented by the angel.Raziel to Noah who used it as a guide. After the flood it was passed down through the Biblical generations to Solomon. The structure of the seven heavens reflects the fairly common cosmology known from Jewish circles during the Hellenistic age. It has close parallels to Talmudic passages, the Enoch literature, and the Hekhaloth literature. The heavens are divided as follows: 1. The first firmament has seven separate encampments. Each encampment is ruled by an angelic overseer who has numerous angels listed as serving him. 2. The second firmament is divided into twelve steps or levels. Each has between nine and twenty angels who can be called upon. 3. The third firmament is ruled by three angels. Each has a troop of angels which serve him. 4. The fourth firmament is divided between thirty-one angelic princes and their encampments who lead the sun during the day and thirty-one angelic princes and their encampments who lead the sun during the night."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION   7   5. The fifth firmament is ruled by twelve princes of glory who represent the twelve months of the year. 6. The sixth firmament is divided between an eastern overlord who rules twenty-eight angelic leaders and their encampments and a western overlord who rules thirty-one angelic leaders and their encampments. 7. The seventh firmament is a description of the divine throne followed by a long doxology. Each firmament, except the seventh, and each subdivision is described as to its nature and function. For each subdivision there is a magical praxis described which can be initiated by calling upon the angels listed in that subdivision and by following the prescribed rites. With few exceptions, the magical praxis will reflect the descriptions of either the angels or the heaven itself. The rules of sympathy and contagion are clearly in evidence. With minor exceptions, this is an outline of the over all structure of any given subdivision. I. A description of the firmament followed by A.

In some cases, additional actions and/or invocations to assist, alter, or reverse the magical praxis A fine analysis of the form and style of these incantations and invocations has been done by Niggemeyer, Beschw^rungsformeln, 63-118."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"8   SEPHER HA-RAZIM •'\"A notable exception to the consensus is Ithamar Gruenwald, (Apocalyptic, 226), who dates the work to sixth or seventh century. C. DATE Dating an eclectic text is difficult at best. The consensus of those scholars who have worked with the text is to support Margal-ioth 's dating of SHR to the early fourth or late third century CE.\"^ The reasons generally listed for this are: 1. The reference to the Roman indictions in 1:27-28 (cf. Margalioth, Sepher, 24) gives a clear terminus a quo of 297 CE. 2. The majority of the text is written in a pure midrashic Hebrew which reflects the period. 3. Many of the Greek words found in the text are technical terms used in the magical praxeis of that period. 4. The spells and incantations of SHR closely parallel the magical material preserved in the Greek magical papyri and in the Aramaic incantation bowls. 5. The forms of the adjurations are similar to material we know from the early Rabbinic literature. 6. The cosmological framework of the text reflects the Enoch and Hekhaloth literature of that period. Although Margalioth's basic assumptions have gained the support of the majority of scholars, we must understand exactly what it is we are dating. There are two different types of document here. The first is a cosmological framework which shows a marked similarity with the hekhaloth literature. The second is a collection of unrelated magical praxeis which show a marked similarity to the materials preserved in PGM. Chen Merchavya (JE 13, 1594-95) implies that the praxeis were woven into the descriptions of the angels and the"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION   9   heavens. This would make the cosmological framework the primary document. Surely the reverse is true. Gruenwald points out the SHR should not be classed as hekhalot literature despite its similarity. The magical praxeis are the primary source. It seems to me more likely that the magical praxeis have been provided with a cosmological framework intended to make them appear as legitimate Jewish practices. Thus the formulas, spells, and incantations presumably existed prior to their present form. The use of Greek and Aramaic words is limited to the actual praxeis. The language of those sections is simple and straightforward. It lacks the flowery descriptive wording and the Biblical quotations of the cosmological framework. The only exception to this lies in the long adjurations of the latter firmaments and these hardly seem part of the original praxeis themselves. SHR has a cosmology which concerns itself in great detail with Jewish ritual purity, but praxeis which demand we eat cakes made from blood and flour. We have a framework which speaks of the glory of YHWH, but praxeis which offer prayers to Helios, and invoke Hermes and Aphrodite. We should indeed date SHR to the early fourth century CE but it is crucial to recognize that what fascinates us most about this text, the magic, is part of a folk tradition which dates from an earlier time. For example, the idol used to quell a rising river in 2:115ff. is clearly one which the Rabbis in Avodah Zarah 3:1 forbid Jews to make or possess. Since the Rabbis found it necessary to ban the image, one must assume that it was in popular use prior to the Mishnah*s compilation. In dating SHR we are not dating the antiquity of the praxeis themselves."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"10   SEPHER HA-RAZIM Just as we cannot date an eclectic text by reference to any one section, so we cannot determine its origin by any one section. Even a number of references will afford no more than a list of possi-bilities. It is far too easy to be led to a conclusion, for example, that SHR is of Egyptian-Jewish origin. The oldest fragments were preserved there. The passage of the sun to the East via the North reflects Egyptian mythology. The use of hieratic papyrus was a sign of the Egyptian priesthood's magical rites. The listing of the descent through the mother was a common Egyptian practice and of course the Roman indictions point to a possible Alexandrian origin. Most compelling, however, is the close similarity between the material preserved in SHR and that of PGM. Such a listing is persuasive until objectively analyzed. That an Egyptian Jewish scribal community preserved the text is no argument for its authorship. The sun's passage is part of other folklores and was surely a common theme in the ancient world. Hieratic papyrus was known as a magical tool outside of Egypt. Descent through the mother was a popular aphorism of the Greco-Roman world as well as a basis for Jewish legal definitions and serves in SHR to insure the effectiveness of the praxis. The indictions were used throughout the Roman world and could easily have been part of a document written in Constantinople. That there are close similari-ties between SHR and PGM is surely of interest but close similarities also exist between SHR and the incantation bowls of Syria. Further-more, that PGM was found only in Egypt merely points out how fortunate we are that Egypt's climate is so well suited for preserving such material."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION   11   Magic was the common property of the people of the Greco-Roman world. The praxeis could have arisen in any part of that world and have been initially preserved in any part of that world. To attempt to locate a single place of origin would be futile. Furthermore, we should not attempt to place the magical praxeis of SHR within any specific group. The praxeis are part of the popular religion of the age. Jews who could place a mosaic of Helios on their synagogue floors certainly could not have found it strange to offer invocations to that same god. On the other hand, SHR has clearly undergone editing at the hands of more \"tradition-ally\" or rabbinically oriented scribes. We can sense the tensions between a developing orthodoxy and a popular religion here. SHR is a fine example of the syncretistic nature of the Hellenistic world. D. THE TRANSLATION A translation either can be literal, to render the exact words of the Hebrew, or can be paraphrastic to catch the meaning. This translation contains elements of both sorts. Its purpose is to convey the meaning in each case as clearly as possible. Parentheses have been used to set off words and phrases which are not found in the Hebrew text, but are either implied, understood, or needed to create a readable translation. I have attempted to follow the Margalioth text as closely as possible. When a different reading is offered it is so footnoted.
