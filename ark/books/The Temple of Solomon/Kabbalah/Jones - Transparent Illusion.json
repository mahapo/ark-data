'Four Entered Paradise\" in the Talmudic Sources and Canticles Rabbah This investigation takes as its starting point a passage which is found in the Babylonian version of the well-known story of four men who enter- ed the garden of Paradise (6719), three of whom came to grief while only the illustrious R. Aqiba survived unscathed. In toseJa, yerushalmi and bablz, the story is included in an anthology of materials associated with the esoteric subjects nyVK12 8vYn and m31n nuyn. This anthol- ogy, which DAVID J. HALPERIN has called the \"mystical collection,\"' is dppended to m.Hag. 2.1, where it is stated that only a D3fl or (in this context) rabbinic sage may study or teach about the divine chariot- throne (7131n8), as described in Ezekiel 1. A fourth version of \"Four Entered Paradise\" is preserved in Midrash Canticles Rabbah, where it is associated with Cant. 1:4, which verse is applied to Aqiba in these four versions of the story. A fifth recension is included in two hekhalot coinpositions, Nekbalot Zutarrr and Merkabah Rabbah. A different, short- er version is preserved in a genizah fragment of Nekbalot Zutarti. I have previously published a detailed anaIysis of this material,' in which I show that the interpretation put forward by GERSHOM G. SCHOLEM,~ drawing on the earlier work of WILHELM BOUSSET;' HANS ' DAVID J HALPERIN, The Merkabah In Rabbrnrc Ltteralure (AOS 62; New Haven, CT. American Oriental Soclety, 1980), espec~ally 65-105.

In that study, I pointed out that the essential point of the versions in the talmudic sources and Canticles Rabbah is provided by the names of the four, only one of whom, Aqiba, was according to tradition a D>n or authorized teacher, accorded the title \"~abbi.\"~ 'The three who came to grief were, according to numerous rabbinic sources, not sages but \"students of the sages\" (~~n>n 777n51-1). In this form, therefore, the story is an illustration of m.Hag. 2.1. In my previous study, I did not inquire into the meaning of the enigmatic warning attributed to Aqiba in babli's version of the story, which is found at Hag. 14b: When you approach the pure marble stones, do not say: 'Water! Water!\" - accord~ng to that which is wrltten: The speakcr oJlies shall not endure before my sight (Ps. 101:7). The versions found in tos~a, yentshalmi and Canticles Rabbah make no mention of this warning, which is also lacking in all but one of the ex- tant manuscripts of the hekhalot recen~ion.~ As will be seen below, the warning refers to a narrative unit which is preserved elsewhere in the hekhalot literature but which, in and of itself, is not immediately con- nected to the 0713 story. The following inquiry will explore the origins and development of the mystical and literary tradition by which these materials were produced and within which they were combined. Before embarking on this undertaking, however, it is necessary to recapitulate the principal points of my analysis of the recensions of \"Four Entered Paradise\" it~elf.~ HANS WINDISCH, Der zwerte Konnfherbnef (Gottingen: Vandenhoeck and Ruprecht, 1924) 375-6.

The permission of the editor of HTR is gratefully acknowledged. THE DANGEROUS UTTERANCE IN \"FOUR ENTERED PARADISE\" 3 The presentation on pages 4-1 1 below is based on the version found in [.Hag. 2.3-5 (according to ms. Vienna),\" which combines three units of material: the story itself (A); and two parables appended by way of commentary, of a king's 0713 (B), and of a \"highwayv which passes between two roads (C).\" Unit A also occurs, with variations, aty.Hag. 77b, b.Hag. 14b-15b and Cant. R. 1.2812 Yerushalmi and babli incorpor- ate additional material (indicated in square brackets) about the arch- heretic Elisha b. Abuyah, otherwise known as Aher (\"the other one\"), but only a very small proportion of this material is common to both source^.'^ Cant. R. 1:28 includes a fragment about Elisha, very approxi- mate parallels of which are found aty.Hag. 77b and b.Hag. 15a-b. Babli also includes additional material about Ben Zoma and Aqiba. Neither babli nor Canticles Rabbah includes R or C, which occur within the Myst- ical Collection in yemshalmi, but in different contexts.I4 Unit C is also found, in an altogether different context, in chapter 28 of Zbot deRabbi Nalan, version A.I5 lo SAUL LIEBERMAN, ed., The Tosefia according to Codex Vienna (4 vols.; New York: Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1962) 2.381; cf. M. S. ZUCKERMANDEL, ed., fisrphfa: Based on the Erfurt and Vienna Codices (2d ed., 1937; reprinted Jerusalem: Wahrmann, 1963) 234. I' I do not include the story of Joshua b. Hananiah and Simeon b. Zoma, which occurs after C in tosefia, mss. Vienna and London, but before B in tosej?u, ms. Erfurt; and at b.Hag. 14b, after A and additional material on Aqiba. In y.Hug. 77a-b, this unit occurs before the Dy?D story and is attached to an incident which concerns Joshua, but not Ben Zoma. The unit also occurs on its own at Gen. R. 2.4.

Let us run! (Cant. 1:4a) The awkward transition from first to third person in A/B2 indicates that the names of the four have been added by a redactor who has obtained them from one of the talmudic recensions. A/B3 will, there- fore, originaily have read: \"one .... one .... one .... and I ...\" as in HZ/MR:Alb. The underlying text of the fragment is thus virtually identical with HZ&MR:A-C, save that Clb, \" .... and wanted to drive me away\" is closer to babli, A55. The only other significant difference is that the fragment includes the application to Aqiba of Cant. 1:4 (C2), which in the HZmR version occurs only in the section derived from talmudic tradition (B2e). Since C2 reverts to the third person, it is probabIe that the redactor of the fragment has also borrowed this item from a talmudic source. 3. Source- and Redaction-Critical Obseruations on 'Fotrr Entered Paradise\" and the On'g'ns of the 'Zscent to Paradise\" Tradition Despite minor differences of detail, the three talmudic sources are clearly derived from a single recension of the 0719 story, narrated exclusively in the third person. This is an extremely formal and formulaic composition, giving a terse, rather enigmatic account of what happened to the four men and applying to each in turn a verse chosen 69 111~32 53no;I? 57K7 HliiW ;IT lph 15 ln7l;I 7713; cf. n. 66 above."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"16 CHAPTER ONE from the scriptures. As observed above, the key to the meaning of this version is provided by the names of the four dramatispersonae, of whom only Aqiba qualifies as a n3n or ordained sage, while the others have the lesser status of ~~n3n ~n>n. In this form, therefore, the story is an explicit illustration of the restriction recorded at m.Hag. 2.1: .... nor concerning tlie iI231n by an individual, unless he were a sage and (had) understood from his own lrno~ledge?~ Whereas tosgta gives only the \"bare bones\" of this recension, both yem- shdlmz and hablr include additional materials about some, though not all of the four characters, as does Cantzcles Rabbah in the instance of Eli~ha.~' These materials are extraneous to the story and, for the most part, outside the scope of the present study. Bablz, however, incorpor- ates two passages about Aqiba into the \"Four Entered Paradise\" narrat- ive itself. These are: Aqiba's warning (All-19) which, as we shall see, alludes to a story which is preserved in the hekhalot tradition, but outside the context of the 0711) story; and the angels' attempt to \"drive him away,\" until overruled by God (A53-60). The latter unit corre- sponds to HZ/MR Cla-c (also in the genizah fragment) where, however, it is rendered in the first person.

THE DANGEROUS UTTERANCE IN \"FOUR ENTERED PARADISE\" 17 The hekhalot version of this unit appears to have priority over that in babli, where >3nt)7? has been altered to wnnwi~?.~~ Canticles Rabbah preserves essentially the same recension as tosefta and yemshalmi, but introduces a new element. In this version, Aqiba explains that he succeeded where the others failed due to the merit of his deeds, and cites m.'Ed. 5.7 in support of this claim (lines A43-49). This explanation, which is incompatible with the meaning of the three talmudic versions (that Aqiba alone of the four was a ~3n), also occurs in HZ/MR:A2a-b (= A/B4-5 of the Genizah fragment). The fact that Canticles Rabbah deviates from the taimudic pattern by employing the first person at this point, and this point only, indicates strongly that the hekhalot version has priority where this item is concerned. The hekhalot sources have, moreover, preserved a version of the 0719 story - the first-person narrative in HZ/MR:A-C - which is differ- ent from and much simpler than that found in the talmudic sources and Cantzcles Rabbah. A subsequent redactor has expanded this first- person narrative by inserting third-person materials taken from the talmudic tradition in section B, but, when this additional material is discounted, it can be seen that the hekhalot version was originally a statement by or attributed to Aqiba that he and three unnamed individ- uals went into D719, that the other three met with disaster, and that he alone went in/up and came out/down safely, despite the opposition of the angels, through the merit of his deeds. This version includes the citation of m.Ei 5.7 (HZ:A2b = A/B5, whence Canl. R., A43-49) but not the scriptural verses quoted in the talmudic re~ension.~' Since the other three dramatis personae are not identified, the meaning cannot be that they were not, like Aqiba, Dmn. Indeed, Aqiba refers to them as D7?3n (\"feilows\"), a term which implies equality of status and, possibly, 74 SCHOLEM (Major Trendr, 358, n. 17) and JOHANN MAIER (Vom Kultuszur Gnosis: Sfudien zur Vor- und Fruhgeschichle der 'fliidischen Gnosis.\" Bundeslade, Golfesthron und Markdbdh [= Kairos 1; Salzburg: Miiller, 19641 4546) have shown that the curious expression 711231 UnnU2'? (\"to make use of my Glory\") refers to theurgic pronunci- ation of the divine Name, originally in the context of the temple cult. Nonetheless, i3no;ii is likely to be the better reading, partly because the 0113 story is concerned throughout with \"looking,\" and partly by reference to m.fjag. 2.1. 75 As observed on p. 15 above, the redactor of the genizah fragment (A/B5) appears to have copied the quotation of Cant. 1:4a from babli (as in HVMR:BZe)."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"18 CHAPTER ONE co-membership of a formallly constituted - perhaps esoteric - society or \"fellowship\" (~TY~XI).~~ Analysis of the textual interrelationships between the talmudic sources and the hekhalot writings thus reveals a fairly complex process of interaction and mutual influence. In HmR:B (still confining our attention to the basic text only) a later redactor has inserted material taken from a talmudic source, which he doubtless regarded as authorit- ative. It should be observed that the source of this section is unlikely to be babli, since the basic text includes only material which is common to tosefa and yemshalrni. Allusions to material which is unique to babli (of the talmudic sources) are encountered only in the interpolated sect- ions of MR(N) and HZ(N), which must, of course, be later The redactor of HZ/MR:B (basic text) has interpolated his talmudic material, which consists basically of the names and the scriptural citiations, into a much simpler and more straightforward version of the story, which carries an altogether different meaning. I conclude, therefore, that the version preserved in HZ/MR:A-C represents the original form of the 0119 story and that the redactor of the mystical collection adapted this source to suit his purpose by adding the names of the three 77772517 D'hX, thereby turning it into an illustration of m.Hag. 2.1.78 Even prior to this adaptation, however, this source must already have been associated with the restriction preserved at m.Hag. 2.1, the language of which is employed in Clc (971131 j3n0i1L) Wl). According to this source, the D713 is located \"behind the 71213\" (Clc), which can only mean: in the holy of holies of the celestial temple?9 Thus, once the priority of the hekhalot version (A and C) has been established, it is clear that the story is concerned with a visionary ascent 76 The word D711n is used of those present at Nehunyah b.

Note also ROWLAND'S observation that inyerusbalmi, the names of the four are not given in the initial story (Al-lo), but only in its subsequent expansion (A20-52), indicating that \"originally there may have been a form of the story in which neither the names of those concerned nor the scriptural texts commenting upon their actions in the garden were included\" (see ROWLAND, fie Open Heaven, 3 14). 79 On the celestial 11319, see pp. 164-172 below.

The pre- talmudic version preserved by the hekhalot redactors (Clc) makes it quite clear that the object at which Aqiba, alone of the four, was worthy to look was God's \"Glory\" (7113) - which is to say, the object of Ezekiel's vision, the >i7:\"7iq (Ezek. 1:28, etc.) or >H!vl 7;[?~ Ti23 (Ezek. 8:4, etc.), these being the prophet's terms for the divine manifesta- tion in \"a form like the appearance of a man\" (D78 7HlD3 nm7) upon the heavenly throne (Ezek. l:26).\" On the expression d71n 53~5n, see MORRAY-JONES, \"Paradise Revisited.

This usage is derived from ancient traditions which identified the Garden of Eden with the heavenly sanctuary and/or its earthly counterpart.82 In the second part of my previous study of this material, I demonstrate that Paul the Apostle uses the term \"Paradise\" (napd6~too~) in this same sense at 2 Cor. 12:4 in his account of a visionary ascent to the heavenly temple, during the course of which he clalmed to have received from Christ his apostolic commission to the gentiles.83 It should be observed in passing that, according to most versions, the story does not state that the four men \"entered 0713\" in company with each other.

In section C of HwR, Aqiba seems clearly to be describing a solitary ascent, for - apart from the angels and the Holy One - there is no mention of companions. The language of the geniz- ah fragment (A/B2): \"We four were going ....\" (~Dl31 1377;1 7Y21fi) may perhaps indicate that this redactor believed that the four men undertook the practice of the heavenly ascent together, on the same occasion or occasions. Even this, however, may simply mean that they prformed certain ritual practices and/or devotional exercises together, in prepara- tion for the visionary ascent. Other passages of the hekhalot literature seem to reflect an historical situation rn which the practice of heavenly ascent was associated with cultic group activity.84 Descriptions of the ascent-experience itself, however, involve only one visionary traveller at a time and nowhere, to my knowledge, do we find an account of a heav- enly group excursion. It is not, therefore, necessary to infer that any individual's experience of the celestial journey was believed to be other than internal or subjective. It is, admittedly, true that the redactor of bablr (All) [= MR(N):Blb] seems to have believed that Aqiba instructed the three disciples prior to the heavenly journey and warned them of its danger, but this does not necessarily imply a communal experience. In any case, both \"Four Entered Paradise\" itself and this interpolated section are, as we shall see, the products of a complex exegetical and mystical tradition, not accounts of actual historical events. The parable of the king's garden (Bl-8 above), which is directly appended to the story of the four in tosejla (though not in yertlsbalmr), confirms our identification of the 0719 with the innermost chamber or chambers of the temple. As indicated in my previous study:' this par- able refers to the actual structure of the Jerusalem sanctuary building (53732). The \"garden\" (D119) represents the ground floor, which cont- ained the outer sanctuary and the holy of holies, while the \"upper chamber\" (i?77>~) is the empty, unused space which occupied the upper portion of the building. Tractate m.Mzddot, which refers to this chamb er as the D7W7i77 7W7i7 n71 n77?~, states that, whenever it became necess- ary to make repairs to the internal walls of the holy of holies, the work- men were let down from here in closed boxes \".... lest they should feast 84 See the account of Nehunyah b.

'W77 ny2B ITPI3y 11177 S~W).'\"~ The same formula occurs in toseja's version of the parable (B8), indicat- I ing clearly that the object at which the three unworthy travellers all \"looked\" was the celestial holy of holies. In my previous study, I argued that this interpretation of the par- able does not apply to the version found in yemshalmi, \"which occurs in a different context and has a completely different meaning.\"87 I now consider this judgement to be mistaken. It was based on the obser- vation that the parable in y.Ha8 77c occurs outside the immediate con- text of the 0713 story (though within the mystical collection) and is appended to another parable which concerns a king's palace (17~43). The parable of the palace will furnish a significant clue at a later stage of this investigation,88 but it does not carry the same meaning as the par- able of the king's garden in the context of the story of the four as we find it in toseja. There is no apparent connection of meaning between the two parables and it is probable that an editor ofyemshalmi has com- bined them for no other reason than their similarity of form.89 It is therefore unlikely thaty.Hag. 77c is the original context of the parable of the garden. Philological considerations indicate, moreover, that in yemshalmz, as in tos$a, the parable of the garden is inherently connected to the story of the four. Lines B7-8 ofyemshalmi read: ~ll? ft? hft Y~Y;I? l'?~. In my previous study, I understood the verb Y13 to mean \"strike\" or \"injure\" and translated: \"One may look, but not damage (it),\"\" but this was almost certainly an error. HAL PER IN^' and NEUSNER~~ both offer: \".... look, but not touch,\" as is perhaps at first sight most natural. The translation on page 8 above, however, is based on the observation that the word ~115 appears to be an echo of the saying attributed to Aqiba in babli, lines A12-13: .... ll?P V'V 733K ~YX. D'Y'Xn DnKV)). Here, the verb Ylf, admittedly in its hlfil form, means \"to approach\" or \"to arrive at,\" a meaning which may also be carried by the qal form of th~s verb.93 This linguistic connection, if valid, may just possibly indicate that Aqiba's saying in the form preserved by bablz, All-19 was also known to the redactor of yerushalmz. It is much more likely, however, that both occurrences of Y3.1 lyemshalmi, B8 and bablz, A12) are independently derived from the saying attributed to Aqiba in the earlier version of the 0713 story, as preserved in the hekhalot sources (Clc): .... 7111~1 >K ~nyliIvx. On its own, this linguistic connection between the story of the four and the parable of the garden in yemshalmz may perhaps be considered rather weak and inconclusive. It is, however, strongly supported by another very clear link: namely, the h@l verb, ~7~74 (also in toseja, B7) which is used throughout the 6713 story, in all sources, of the three who \"looked.\"94 I conclude, therefore, that the parable of the king's garden has been displaced in yerushalmz, that toseja locates it in its proper context, that it correctly identifies the 0719 with the (celestial) holy of holies, that it was originally composed as an interpretative comment on the story of the four, and that the author of the parable was very probably aware of the pre-talmudic version preserved in the hekhalot sources (as indicated by the verb Y11). In the case of the parable of the two roads (Cl-17), no such linguist- ic connections are discernible and the relevance of this parable to the 0713 story seems, therefore, to be very doubtful. MAIER associates the imagery of fire and snow with I Enoch 14:13, where it is stated that the celestial temple was \"hot Iike snow and cold like ice.\"95 In yemshalmi and lii'bot deRabbi Natan, however, the parable appears in contexts which do not support this interpretation and it is, therefore, unlikely that it originally had this meaning. Nonetheless, it may be that the redactor of toseja's version did make the association suggested by MAIER, which 86 m Mzd 4.5 (= b Pes 26a).

The mystical collection is evidently older than any of the talmudic sources in which it is preserved. Assuming that the earliest talmudic source, tos$a, achieved its final form during the mid- to late fourth century CE, the mystical collection must have been compiled in the third or very early fourth century at latest.lo2 The underlying hekhalot recension of \"Four Entered Paradise\" has in turn been found to predate the mystical collection, which means that it cannot have been written much later than the middle of the third century. This terminus ad quem is separated by little more than a century from the terminus a quo of the story its present form, namely, the lifetime of its hero, Aqiba. It is therefore entirely possible that the story goes back to Aqiba himself or to the circle of his disciples. It may even be the case that a preexistent unit of tradition was appropriated by or posthumously attributed to him. The evidence of Paul's account of his ascent to Paradise (2 Cor. 12:l-12), the content and language of which have been found to include more - and more precise - parallels with the story of the four than can be accounted for by coin~idence,'~~ indicates that the key components 101 See MORRAY~ONES, \"Merkabah Mystlclsm and Talmudic Tradition: A Study of the Traditions Concerning hammerkabab and ma'afeh merkabab in Tannaitlc and Amoraic Sources\" (Ph.D, dm., Cambridge Unlverslty, 1988); zdem, \"Paradlse Rev~sited.

Nm York of Hekhalot Zutarti Aqiba's enigmatic warning to refrain from saying \"Water! Water!\" in the vicinity of the \"marble stones\" is evidently a reference to a known location to or through which the visionary must travel in the course of his heavenly journey. Of the talmudic and midrashic versions, the warning is mentioned only in babli's version of the 0119 story (All-19). It is not found in tosefia, yemshalmi or Canlicles Rabbah, nor does it occur in the first-person account preserved in HwMR:A-C, which we have identified as the earliest surviving version of the story. We have seen that section B of the hekhalot recension is an editor- ial expansion of the original story. Here, the material common to all four manuscripts appears to be lifted directly from a talmudic version which did not include Aqiba's warning. This interpolated text has in turn been expanded in different ways by the redactors of MR(N) and HZ(N). The material unique to MR(N) includes Aqiba's warning (Blb) in a form which agrees verbatim with mss. London 400 and Vatican 171 of babli,'05 but there is no way of telling which of these sources has priority and MR(N) provides no additional information to explain the further MORRAY-JONES, \"Paradise Revisited.

In my opinion, GOSHEN GOT- STEIN'S theory of the story's origin and meaning is produced by an invalid method and proceeds from false assumptions. It is not, however, possible to provide an adequate rebuttal of his position without a detailed analysis of his argument and the extensive body of textual material by which it is supported. Such an analysis requires more space than is available within the confines of this study and will therefore be published in another place (see ROWLAND and MORRAY-JONES, The Mystety of God: Jewish Mysfical Traditions in the New Testament [CRiNT 3; Assen/Minneapolis: Van Gorcum/Fortress, in preparation]). lo5See p. 5, n. 25, and cf. p. 13, n. 57, above."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"28 CHAPTER ONE unit's meaning.lo6 Turning to the material unique to HZ(N), B2c agrees almost verbatim with Cant. R. 1.28.'07 HZ(N):B2a-b, however, introduces material which is not found in any talmudic or midrashic source and which bears directly on the meaning of Aqiba's warning in babli, even though the warning itself does not occur in this version: B2a Ben Azzai looked into the sixth palace and saw the brilliance of the air of the marble stones with which the palace was paved (nli15~ 17ii7w V7W '31K 171x 17t 537~3)L08 and his body could not bear it, and he opened his mouth and asked them: \"These waters -what is the nature of them (7270 ;m '155;i Dm)?\" and died. Of him, scripture says: Precious in the Ta of the LORD is the death of his saints (Ps. 116:15). B2b Ben Zoma loolced at the brilliance in the marble stones (IUSW? '31X1 17Tl) and thought that they were water, and his body could bear that he did not ask them, but his mind could not bear it and was smitten - he went out of his mind. Of him scripture says: Haweyoufiund honq? Eat what is enoughj6ryou ..., etc. (Prov. 25:16). Here the cause of Ben Azzai's death and Ben Zoma's affliction (glossed as madness) are explained as the consequences of an hallucination: the marble stones look like, but are not really, water. When Ben Azzai sees this, he is unable to refrain from asking a question which brings about his death. Ben Zoma manages not to ask the question, but the mental strain of resisting the urge to do so drives him mad. Both characters seem to know that the question should not be asked, but this fore- knowledge cannot easily be explained by reference to Aqiba's warning, which is not included in this manuscript's version of the 0119 story. We are not told to whom the question is addressed, but the hallucina- tion is evidently connected with \"looking\" into the sixth 5378. While 106 It is worth observing, however, that MR(N)'s rendering of the story of Aher's encounter with Metatron (B2d) appears to represent a stage of development between 3 Enoch 16:l-5, which is probably the original source of this unit, and the earliest manuscript version of b.Hag. 15a (see the discussion of this material by ALEXANDER, MORRAY-JONES, and DEUTSCH, cited on pp. 13-14, n. 64 above). The possibilty that babli is dependent on MR(N):B2d - perhaps also, Blb - must therefore be considered. lo' See p. 3 above. '08 Literally: \".... the brilliance of the air of the marble stones, which were paved i11 the palace.\" See further pp. 92-96 below. THE DANGEROUS UTTERANCE IN \"FOUR ENTERED PARADISE\" 29 the \"brilliance\" associated with the stones is perhaps natural enough, the mention of \"air\" in B2a is puzzling. This material is evidently related to an episode described elsewhere in the hekhalot writings and located, as in this passage, at the gate of the sixth 5375. In this episode, which makes no reference to the 0713 story, the mystic sees (or is shown) a vision of what appears to be water, although this appearance is an illusion. If he fails to recognize the illu- sion as such and asks about the water, he is deemed unworthy to enter the sixth 53'lii and assaulted by its angelic guardians, who accuse him of being descended from the worshippers of the golden calf. It is clear from the immediately preceding material that the redactors of the surviving editions regarded this episode as a test and most modern commentators have interpreted it in this light. Two significantly differ- ent recensions of this episode (henceforth: \"the water vision episodeD) are preserved in the hekhalot compilations. These are examined in detail in chapter three below. First, however, it is necessary to consider the significance of the location at the entrance to the sixth 53'7 and to review previous scholarly discussion of this enigmatic episode and its meanlng. 5. F5e Cosmic Temple As we have seen, the 0113 of \"Four Entered Paradise\" is identified with the interior of the heavenly sanctuary, and especially with the celestial holy of holies. This equation must be understood in relation to a basic structural motif of the Jewish literature of heavenly ascent, in which the journey into heaven is typically envisaged as a procession through the courts of a cosmic temple.i09 In the majority of accounts, the courts and chambers of this temple are not merely \"in\" heaven, but are them- selves the discrete celestial levels or \"heavens\" of the cosmos. This 109 See further: HIMMELFARB, \"Apocalyptic Ascent and the Heavenly Temple,\" SBLSP26 (1987) 210-217; idtm, Ascent to Heaven in Jewish and Christian Apocalypses (New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993); and MORRAY-JONES, \"The Temple Within: The Embodied Divine Image and its Worship in the Dead Sea Scrolls and Other Early Jewish and Christian Sources,\" SBLSP (1998) 400431.

True, DE JONGE comments that the relevant fragment of the Arama~c Lev1 document from Qumran (44213, 1.11 15-18) \"does not necessarily presuppose more than one heaven\" (tbrd, 253), but th~s observat~on does not apply to the developed recensions of Testament of Lmr. The \"nona\" Greek and Armen~an recenslons, which refer twice to an arrangement of three plus four heavens, are bel~eved by DE JONGE to have prlority over the \"a\" recenslons, wh~ch have three heavens only. Nonetheless, he states that the extra four heavens In the \"nona\" recenslons are \"clearly redact~onal\" (tbrd, 259), ~mply~ng that a three-heaven version THE DANGEROUS UTTERANCE IN \"FOUR ENTERED PARADISE\" 3 1 celestial levels are clearly portrayed as the courts and chambers of the cosmic temple, the highest heaven being called the holy of holies.ll4 Although Paul's account of his ascent to Paradise in \"the third heaven\" reverts to the simpler threefold cosmology, it is largely dis- placed by the seven-tiered model in the later apocalyptic literature. The sevenfold model is also encountered in the thirteen Songs ofthe Sabbath Samtce (nlwil nhy nllsW) from Qumran, where the seven sanctuaries (tls1'17) of the celestial temple are evidently identical with the seven heavens. This is most clearly apparent in the description of the seventh sanctuary, the holy of holies: Sin[g praise] to Go[d who is Dr]eadful in power, [allyou spirits of knowledge and light] in order to [exallt together the splendidly shining firmament of [His] holy sanctuary. [Give praise to Hrlm, 0 you god[like] spirits, in order to pdaise for ever and elver the firmament of the uppermost heaven, all [its beams] and its walls, a[l]l its Vor]m, the work of [its] struc[ture.\"' Here, the parallel expressions \"firmament of his holy sanctuary\" and \"firmament of the uppermost heaven\" indicate clearly that the inner- most sanctuary is the highest heaven. This is confirmed by the fact that the \"uppermost heaven\" is described as having \"beams\" and \"walls.\" Turning to the hekhalot literature, we find in 3 Enoch 18:3-4'16 and Mmekhet Hekhalot, 94'17 that all seven palaces are located in the uppermost of the seven heavens. From a formal point of view, however, these two texts are somewhat atypical of the hekhalot corpus, the former being an apocalypse and the latter a fairly conventional midrashic com- pilation. Neither text describes the practice of the heavenly ascent. In of the text did, in fact, precede the seven-heaven version.

It thus appears that the more elaborate sevenfold division of the temple may have been developed on the basis of the threefold schema by dividing the area between the 3170 (or wall) and the sanct- uary building into four distinct zones of ascending sanctity (Jose's areas 2-5). All this suggests that the seven- and three-level cosmologies correspond to the hierarchic structure of the Temple more or less as follows: Seuenfuld Model nrcejold Modrl 1. Within the 3170 1.

When the seven-tiered celestial schema of the hekhalot writings is related to the structure of the temple, it appears that the gate of the sixth 3277, where the water vision episode occurs, corresponds to the entrance of the sanctuary building. That an element of danger should be associated with the transition across this threshold is not, perhaps, surprising, but the nature of that danger in the water vision episode is, as yet, unclear. 124 See further, NEHER, \"Le voyage mystique,\" 73-76. j2' Cf.

This approach was roundly rejected by SCHOLEM, who likewise believed Aqiba's warning to be an original element of the story, but sought to explain it by reference to the water vision episode of the hekhalot tradit- ion. Correlating the text of babli with the hekhalot versions of \"Four Entered Paradise,\" he wrote: Modern Interpretations of this famous passage, which clearly enough refers to a real danger In the process of ascending to 'Paradise,' are extremely far-fetched and not a little lrratlonal in their determination at all costs to preserve the character- ist~c essentials of rat~onalism. We are told that the passages refers (stc) to cosmol- ogical speculat~ons about the materrapnma, an explanation whicl~ lacks all plaus- ibility and finds no support in the context or In the subject matter itself. The fact 1s that the later Merkabah mystics showed a perfectly correct understanding of the meaning of this passage, and their interpretation offers striking proof that the tradition of Tannaitic mysticism and theosophy was really alive among them, although certain details may have originated In a later period?

SCHOLEM, Major Trends, 52 (italics his); cf. idem, Jmish Gnosticism, 14-16. It should be noted that SCHOLEM here assigns priority to babli, which, in his opinion, has been interpreted correctly by \"the later Merkabah mystics,\" who, presumably, are represented by the redactor of the 0719 story in HZ(N), B2a-b. Referring to the water vision episode itself, according to the recension found elsewhere in HZ: he comments: The authenticity of the story's core, the ecstatic's vision of water, hardly requires proof. Nothing could be more far-fetched than to treat it as apostIfrstum interpr- etation of the Talmudic passage: there is no reason whatsoever to doubt that the mystical experience of the dangers of the ascent is really the subject of the anec- dote.4 SCHOLEM, then, presupposes that Aqiba's warning in babli, A1 1-19 is the source of HZ(N), B2a-b. Nonetheless, he believes that the redactor of HZ(N) has correctly understood the warning to be an allusion to a \"real\" - or, in some sense, objective - visionary experience which had also been encountered by other heavenly travellers in a continuous trad- ition which originated in, if not before, the tannaitic period. Confirm- ation of this is, in SCHOLEM'S opinion, provided by the water vision episode itself, which he takes to be an independent account of the same visionary experience. The following study will confirm SCHOLEM'S fund- amental insight that the mystical traditions to which these texts refer are both authentic and early. The weakness of his source-critical analysis must, however, be acknowledged, since he ignores the fact that the passage which supposedly interprets Aqiba's warning, as found in babli, and the water vision episode, which allegedly confirms the accuracy of that \"interpretation,\" are both found in the same source, HZ, and so cannot be assumed to be independent of each other. It should also be noted that SCHOLEM was by no means the first modern scholar to interpret Aqiba's warning as a reference to a vision encountered in the course of a heavenly ascent. This had already been proposed by BOUSSET and, later, BIETENHARD, who both maintained some continuity with previous scholarship by suggesting that the warn- ing is directed against Gnostic interpretations of the vision's rnear~ing.~ SCHOLEM, who, as we have seen, rejected this view, was apparently ' See pp. 55-59 below; SCHOLEM (Major Trendi, 52-53) quotes ms.

SCHOLEM'S solution did not satisfy NEHER, who, rightly recognizing that the 0713 of the ascent tradition is the celestial temple, interpreted Aqiba's words in the light of Ezekiel's eschatological vision of water flowing from beneath the temple (Ezek. 47:l-12). He suggested that Aqiba was warning the irmln '711' who experienced such visions not to be misled into succumbing to the catastrophic delusion of imminent messianic expectation.' MAIER, who likewise perceived that Aqiba's w~rning alludes to the vision of the heavenly prototype of the Jerusalem temple,' explained the \"pure marble stones\" by reference to the brilliant white masonry of the actual temple, as described in several ancient sources.' MAIER found an especially striking parallel in the following baraita: Our rabbis taught .... .... He who has not seen the sanctuary on compietion of its construction has never seen a beautiful building in his life. Which one? Abaye or, some say, R. Hisda, said: This is the building of Herod. Of what did he build it? Rabbah said: Of yellow and white marble stones (~7nini KtU'v ';>Hl) - there are those who say: Of yellow, black and marble stones (Kln1)31 ~5m3 KV7V 7f3N1) - in alternately recessed and projecting rows, so that it could be plastered, for he intended to cover it with gold. Our rabbis said to him: Leave it be - it is more beautiful just as it is, for it resembles the waves of the sea.9 It certainly seems possible that this baraita is in some way related to Aqiba's warning. The difference of opinion about the varieties of the stones seems, however, to be an indication that the baraita is not based on historical memory. There is, moreover, no mention of the wavelike appearance of the stones in any contemporary description of Herod's temple. The possibility must therefore be considered that the baraita is NEHER, \"Le voyage mystique,\" especially 59-68 and 77-82.

In the baraita, however, the appearance of water is here given a positive val- uation, which is contrary to both \"Four Entered Paradise\" and the water vision episode itself. Thus, although the baraita seems to confirm the association between the marble stones which look like water and the temple, it does not help us to explain the extreme danger which attaches to them. MAIER found a reference to the marble stones of the celestial temple in the description of Enoch's visionary ascent in 1 Enoch 14: (9).... and I went in until I approached a wall, built of hailstones, with tongues of fire surrounding it, and it began to terrify me. ('')And I went into the tongues of fire and approached a great house built of hailstones; and the walls of the house were like smooth ashlars (ht06.rrha~~q), and they were all of snow, and the floor was of snow; (\")and the ceiling (was) like shooting stars and lightning- flashes; and between them (were) fiery cherubim; and their heaven (was) water; (\"'and a flaming fire surrounded the walls; and the doors were ablaze with fire.'' MAIER argued, however, that although Aqiba's warning in babti is indeed derived from the ascent tradition, as SCHOLEM maintained, the saying is a late addition to the story of the four, which originally referred to non-visionary exegetical speculation about the heavenly temple and was only later interpreted as an account of an actual heavenly ascent.\" MAIER further associated the image of water with the primordial chaos waters of ancient Near Eastern and Hebrew mythology, but did not develop this point in detail.I2 GOLDBERG offered the important observation that, according to both hekhalot and midrashic tradition, the basic substance of the celestial realm is fire. He inferred that the meaning of the water vision episode is that one who misperceives the substance of the n1'73'ir as water thereby betrays himself to the angels as a \"liar\" who, like the Israelites who kissed the golden calf, has wor- shipped a false image of the deity.13 lo I Enoch 14:9-12.

He understood the expression \"Water! Water!\" to be an idiom for ecstatic experience associated with the vision of the pavement below the celestial throne, and attributed the pericope to the rabbintc redactors of bablz, who, in his opinion, regarded the claim to have exper- ienced such visionary revelations as a blasphemous lie.22 On this basis, URBACH argued that the hekhalot tradition of the water-like marble stones, far from being the source of the talmudic unit, was originally an attempt to explain the talmudic pericope itself. He failed, however, to provide adequate justification of his claim that water is a recognizable metaphor for ecstatic experience as or to account for the form of Aqiba's warning in bablz: \"Wen you approach .... do not say ...,\" which appears to imply participation in a visionary ascent and thus directly to contradict the meaning that URBACH attributed to it. WEWERS, like URBACH, believed the warning to be a late expansion of the story of the fo~r.2~ He interpreted it by reference to the story of Ben Zoma's meeting with Joshua and his disciples \"in the street,\" where Ben Zoma is portrayed as being deeply absorbed in misguided contemplation of the upper and lower waters of creation.z5 Although this story makes no mention of marble stones, WEWERS evidently felt justified in reading it in combination with Aqiba's warning in babli, so that each explained the other. On this basis, he attributed a very literal and concrete - if rather fantastic - meaning to Aqiba's words, arguing that they may originally have referred to an hallucination which might '' ROWLAND, \"The Visions of God,\" 149.

Aqiba warns his students: If you are going along the street in a state of absorption and think that you see this water, you are in error, for in reality this is the dazzling stones of the buildings that surround you. This means, however, that R. Aqiba not only understood the practice of entry into 0719, but also rejected it for his students. Even if a later era made a heroic tale out of this, it must still be emphasized that in this rejection, and in the consequences described, a defensive stance correspon- ding to that of [m.Jfag. 2.11 is established?' Thus, WEWERS agrees with URBACH that the warning was originally a polemic against involvement in visionary practice and experience, as opposed to exegetical activity. His speculation with regard to the nature and cause of the vision is, however, based on a very dubious intertextual reading of the sources and has not met with widespread support. Equal- ly unconvincing is the suggestion of HENRY A. FISCHEL that Aqiba's words are a satirical warning against the dangers of Epicurean philos- ~ph~.'~ Although FISCHEL is able to find references in Epicurean and other Greco-Roman sources to celestial journeys involving visions of shining walls, gates and buildings, the supposed parallels are weaker and less convincing than those found in Jewish sources. They are certainly much too general to justify his bold conclusion that the resplendent stones of the Akiba warning must be reminiscent of the wall, gate, building or fortress which in poetry and ecstatic vision represents the celestial world in certain Greco-Roman traditions and which was appropriated in the Epicurean pseudoapo~al~~se.~~ 26 WEWERS, Geheimnis, 187-188 (my translation). 27 HENRY A.

Nevertheless, his theory of its meaning is a develop- ment of his interpretation of \"Four Entered Paradise\" as an anti-Epicurean polemic, the term Dl19 standing for the garden (~-jnoq) in which Epicurus lived with his disc- iples (ibid., 1-24).

Water!\" is simply a parody of the enthusiastic but incoherent rhetorical style of the Epicur- eans, he proposes the following very forced and speculative paraphrase of Aqiba's warning: When (in your discussions with Epicureans) you reach (the point at which they begin to speak ofj 'the place of pure marble splendor' do not (be carried away by their enthusiasm and) say (like them ecstatically) 'water, water' (or whatever the dialogue may toucll upon at this point).\" In the same category of forced interpretation, SAMSON H. LEVEY has suggested that the warning is a cryptic allusion to the waters of baptism, this being an extension of his unconvincing argument that the word 0713 represents the Greek term nap66oay and that the four named characters were all involved in study of Christian belief and d~ctrine.~' Most recent commentators, whatever their views concerning the original meaning of the story of the four, have concurred with MAIER'S opinion that, while Aqiba's warning was not part of the original 0719 story (contra SCHOLEM), it was derived from the Jewish ascent tradition (contra URBACH and WEWERS). SCHAFER summarizes this position as follows: The cornbination of thepardes narrative with the water episode is redactional and thereby secondary. This is valid for Hekhalot literature as well as for the one Tal- mudic attestation (bHag 14b). The original Sitz im Lcben of thepardes narrative is the rabbinic school; the Sifz im Lehen of the water episode is Merlcavah mystic- ism?'

SCHAFER'S conclusion concerning the origin of the water vision episode is supported by JOSEPH DAN'S detailed study of the hekhalot traditions about the dangers encountered by the il23in 77117 at the gate of the sixth bil, in which he demonstrates that several layers of editor- ial activity can be detected in the extant sources, reflecting the growth and modification of these traditions over time.32 At what he believes to be the earliest stages of textual development, DAN observes that the actions of the angelic gatekeepers, especially the \"tests\" to which they subject the mystic, are portrayed as cruel, arbitrary and irrational, although subsequent generations of editors have tried to modify this I impression in various ways. In its original form, he argues, the water vision episode was also characterized by these qualities and was not, in fact, a test at all, since its outcome was ~redeterrnined.~~ He concludes that these traditions about the dangers of the heavenly ascent originated I independently of the rabbinic 0713 tradition and only penetrated the talmudic literature at the late stage of editorial activity represented by babli (A1 1-19). DAN'S careful and methodical structural analysis of the material yields many significant insights, but he does not offer an I explanation of the meaning of the water vision episode and is content merely to emphasize its \"arbitrary\" nature. HALPERIN is skeptical regarding SCHOLEM'S insistence that Aqiba's warning refers to a \"real\" visionary experience, pointing out that this I explanation seems to attribute a spurious objectivity to the supposed experience of the vision of water: Scholem's stress on the reallty of the merkabah myst~cs' ecstatlc experiences can be mlsleadlng.

Following a detailed comparative analysis of the sources, he argued that babli's version of the 0113 story (All-19) combines the imagery of the celestial temple (\"pure marble stones\") with that of God's battle with the waters of chaos, and that Aqiba's warning refers to a traditional belief that a traveller to the heavenly temple might be (or appear to be) assaulted by these waters.36 Allusions to this tradition are, HALPERIN believes, encountered in a variety of rabbinic, Gnostic and apocalyptic sources. He carefully documents and analyzes an exten- sive midrashic tradition in which the battle with the waters is associated especially with God's appearance on the ?231)9 at the Red Sea crossing, and in which the origin of the sin of the golden calf is traced to the distorted image of the 323173, reflected in the water: The merkabah that appears In the waters has become part of the waters.

It is, in any case, certain that the very diverse contents of the helchalot compilations are drawn from several different source traditions and did not all orlglnate In their present context. 43 HALPERIN IS, In fact, alert to these methodological concerns. 44 See the water vision episode, sectlon D2 (on p. 56 below); cf. \"Four Entered Paradise\" In HZ(N), B2a (on p. 13 above).

Water!\" Only In the later stages of textual transmission, as the original meaning of the test became confused, was this too understood to be a sign of failure. REICHMAN fails, however, to provide textual evidence to support this speculative reconstruction. His \"anti-Gnostic\" reading of the episode is, moreover, unsatisfactory, since it fails to elucidate the central image of water, which, unless we are to believe that it was chosen merely at random, can hardly be devoid of significance. The pursuit of rational scholarly inquiry thus excludes us from the pre-critical paradise of REICHMAN'S 3131n 7?117, since it requires us to fail the alleged test by asking what this enigmatic but specific image means. The theory that the dangerous illusion of water can be explained by reference to Gnostic traditions has been revisited from time to time.

As HALPERIN has observed with regard to SCHOLEM'S exposition of the hekhalot materials, this attributes to visionary experience a degree of objectivity which, from a rational point of view, is problematicP9 More recently, NATHANIEL DEUTSCH has drawn attention to some striking parallels to the water vision episode in Mandean sources, which clearly are related in some manner to the hekhalot tradition^.^^ The relevant Mandean traditions are associated especially with Abathur, a cosmic figure whose role and characteristics are in many respects parallel to those of the Jewish angel Metatron.\" Like Metatron, Abathur is en- throned as guardian and judge at the entrance to the \"World of Light\" or \"House of Life,\" which is separated from the material universe by a body of water called the hajqia mia or \"water brooks.\" If the ascending soul is judged worthy to enter the House of Life, it is helped to cross over these waters, but if not, it is overwhelmed by them and imprisoned in one of seven or eight lower \"watchhouses,\" inhabited by demons who torment the soul as it awaits the final judgement.52 Whereas some interpreters of Mandeism have looked for an Iranian background to these images and ideas, DEUTSCH demonstrates that they are of Jewish 1981) 2.817. 48 The three texts are: The Book ofBaruch by the Gnostic Justin, as quoted by Hip- polytus, Rf, 526,11-13 and 5 27,3; Melchrzrdek, NHC ix.8,l; and Zostnanos, NHC vi11.18,3-9 (see STROUMSA, rbzd). 49 See p. 42 above.

It may be observed in passing that this text is strongly associated with the ;1231)3 tradition, in part because of its similarity to Ezekiel and in part because of midrashim which apply it to the Red Sea the~~han~.~' DEUTSCH links the Mandean motif of celestial waters with the three Gnostic texts cited by STROUMSA, and also with the Jewish and Christ- ian apocalyptic sources discussed by ROW LAND.^' He regards Aqiba's warning in babli as a veiled polemic against the teachings of one or more non-rabbinic groups, who are represented by texts such as these. Citing evidence of hostility between Mandeans and Jews in Babylonia, he argues that this polemic included the Mandeans among its targets and may well, in fact, have been directed specifically against them. He concludes: The motif of heavenly water appears in Jewish apocalyptic sources but its adoption by Christian apocalyptic circles, Gnosticism, and Mandaeism may have encouraged the authors of the Merliabah texts to reject it. Were it known to the authors of the Talmud or the Helthalot passages, the Mandaean formulation of the heavenly waters would have been particularly disturbing because of its many close parallels with the Merkabah trad' ition ' .... 53 See DEUTSCH, \"Dangerous Ascents,\" 7-8, and rdem, Guardrans, 107-108 and 112- 113, and the sources clted there. 54 See DEUTSCH, \"Dangerous Ascents,\" 9, and rdem, Guardrans, 113-114. 55 2 Sam. 22:7; Ps. 18:7.

Yet they turn the widespread tradition of heavenly water on its head by declaring that the water is only an illusion. This truly esoteric knowledge not only separates the qualified Jewish mystic from the un- qualified, but it also differentiates Jewish mysticism from its late antique com- petition6' DEUTSCH shows that the Mandean writings contain at least one signifi- cant and specific parallel to the water vision episode, which will be examined at a later stage of this inquiry!' For the present, we should note that, although the Mandean materials are undoubtedly relevant, some significant problems are left unresolved by his theory that Aqiba's warning in babli and the hekhalot sources to which it relates can all be explained in terms of sectarian polemic against the Mandeans or any other group. In the first place, the sources contain little or no internal evidence to suggest that their primary concern is sectarian propaganda. Aqiba's warning in babli, citing Ps. 101:7 with its reference to a \"speaker of lies,\" is perhaps susceptible of being interpreted in this way, but the saying, considered in isolation, is so cryptic that, without the support of external evidence, such a reading is no more than speculationP2 DEUTSCH argues that the polemical intent of the passage has been delib erately concealed, reflecting a standard literary technique of rabbinic writers: In such cases, the rabb~s adopted a terse, even enigmatic approach, at least to the eyes of the average reader.

Such polemics are therefore directed to those Jews who already know and in some sense appreciate the views considered heretical and can read between the lines of a more subtle attack. These individ- uals do not require explicit description to identify the target of the polemic and may even be more receptive to a less direct approach.63 Although these remarks may have some validity, they do not justify the reading of sectarian propaganda into passages which contain no evid- ence of such intent. The citation of Ps. 101:7 is not included in the 0113 story in I-IZ(N) or in the water vision episode in either HR or HZ, nor do these sources make any other reference to the utterance of lies. ' DEUTSCH'S hypothesis is thus based primarily on Aqiba's warning in babli, which he appears to assume has priority over the hekhalot materials. The direct linguistic connection that he finds with the Mandean sources occurs, however, not in babli, but in HZP4 His theory therefore includes the questionable assumption that the hekhalot writers shared the same ideological and polemical agenda as the redact- ors of the talmudic literature, and even used the same (alleged) literary technique of disguised propaganda. As DEUTSCH himself recognizes, many elements of the Mandean religion are derived from Hebrew biblic- al and later traditional Jewish sources.65 The Mandean parallels to the talmudic and hekhalot water vision materials may, therefore, indicate that they are derived from the same Jewish source tradition.

For an opposing view, see EDWIN M. YAMAUCHI, Pre-Chnitian Gnosticism: A Sum9 of the Proposed Evidence (2d edn.; Grand Rapids: Baker, 1983) 135-142, who believes that the Mandean religion came about through the fusion of \"an eastern proto-Mandaean component\" with \"a western proto-Mandaean component\" (ibid., 140) which he ident- ifies as a group of Aramaic-speaking non-Jewish inhabitants of Transjordan who may have emigrated to Babylonia following Jewish attacks on neighboring Gentile communities in 66 CE. Thus, in his view, the Jewish elements in Mandeism \"are the result not of consanguinity but merely of contiguity\" (ibid). Note, however, that even if YAMAUCHI'S reconstruction is preferred, the direction of influence is still from Judaism to Mandeism, not vice versa."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"5 0 CHAPTER TWO talmudic and hekhalot redactors were concerned to counter such influ- ence, is thus unproven. A further deficiency of DEUTSCH'S theory is that it leaves the rab binic and hekhalot authors' objection to the motif of water unexplain- ed. His argument seems to imply that they rejected the idea that one who ascended to heaven would find (real) water there for no other reason than that this was believed by the Mandeans and/or other relig- ious groups. This explanation is inadequate. The Jewish writers doubt- less disagreed with many aspects of the teachings of groups such as the Mandeans, and several of these differences will have been perceived to be of fundamental theological importance. Why, then, was the specific motif of celestial water considered to be so objectionable? What are the origin and meaning of the deceptive appearance of the marble stones? By drawing our attention to the Mandean sources, DEUTSCH has made a valuable contribution to the scholarly discussion, but he does not address these all-important questions. With regard to the relationship between the water vision episode and the 0719 narrative, a minority opinion has been defended by ITHAMAR GRUENWALD,~~ who maintained that Aqiba's words in babli are, in effect, \"a muddled quotation\" of words attributed to the same sage in HZ.67 Perceiving the source-critical weakness of SCHOLEM'S reconstruction, GRUENWALD argued: It 1s not, as Professor Scholem argues, that the Hekhalof literature contains the correct ~nterpretation of the saying of Rabbl 'Akiva, but that the words attributed to the sage are words virtually talcen from what already was, or was soon to become, the established Hekhalot tradit~on.~' In GRUENWALD'S opinion, the talmudic sources preserve more or less abridged versions of the b713 story, which had its original sitzimleben in the hekhalot (or proto-hekhalot) tradition and is likely to have included an allusion to the dangerous vision of water from the outset. 66 ITHAMAR GRUENWALD, \";-imin ~11' nmoi \"I' ~3,\" y)37n 36 (1966-7) 261- 266; idem, Apocalyptic, 86-92. \" GRUENWALD, ''7'1' 713179,\" 264, referring to the 0713 story in HZ(N), B2a-b (on p. 13 above) and to the water vlsion episode, also according to HZ(N), Fla-F2 (see pp. 57-58 and 79-81 below), GRUENWALD, Apocalypfic, 88. THE STATUS QUAESTIONIS 5 1 GRUENWALD expressed his view of the relationships between the sources as follows: From examination of the baraita about the four who entered 0119, we learn that it is extremely difficult to explain the sages' words about esoteric subjects by refer- ence to those words alone. On the contrary, comparison of the parallel versions of the baraita with its 'source' in LoseJa shows just how abbreviated the toseJla is in its language. Understanding of toseJa depends on its later parallels, but these in turn already hint that their own interpretation can only come from the original source of the baraita in the circle of the i1131)3 '711'. This is not to say that the source of the baraita is Hekhalof Zularti. We still do not have much informat~on about the process of editing of the hekhalot literature, or about the time when this editing occurred. Because of this, it may be supposed from a formal point of view that the text of Hrkhalot Zutarli was written down later than the text found in babli. On the other hand, however, there can be no doubt at all that the text in Hekhalof Zularti is the one that transmits to us, in a clearer, more open form, the mystical tradition which is concealed in the baraita in tosefta and its parallels.\"9 My analysis of the story of the four has confirmed that it did, in fact, originate in the ascent narrative preserved in HZ, as GRUENWALD main- tains. In the tradition from which that narrative is derived, the divine throne and celestial temple stand in opposition to the evil and destruct- ive waters of chaos, as recognized by both MAIER and HAL PER IN.^' Although the water vision episode is not mentioned in the earliest version of the 0719 story in HZ, A and C, GRUENWALD'S contention that the story may originally have included an allusion to the waters is, to some extent, supported by the work of JAMES R. DAVILA, who finds that the essential ingredients of the tradition of ascent to the celestial garden-temple, as found in \"Four Entered Paradise,\" are already present in a thanksgiving hymn from Qumran, which DAVILA calls \"The Hymn of the Garden.\"\" DAWLA draws attention to the fact that: before he is admitted to the holy garden, the narrator of this hymn withstands an 69 GRUENWALD, \"771' '131'9,\" 265. 70 See also, for example: DAVID NEIMAN, \"The Supercaelian Sea,\" JNES 28 (1969) 243-249; JOHN DAY, God's Confltct wrth the Dragon and the Sea (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985) 18-21; and BARKER, ne Gale of Heaven, 18-20, 62-67. 7' JAMES R.

Combining the evidence produced by MAIER and HALPERIN with that presented by DAVILA, it is possible to reconstruct a pre-rabbinic tradition according to which one who would enter the garden-temple must first cross over the menacing chaos waters, and to infer that both the hekhalot and the talmudic versions of the 0719 story are derived from this tradition. Satisfying as this reconstruction undoubtedly is, several anomalous features of the talmudic and hekhalot textual traditions remain to be explained. The \"marble stones\" and their resemblance to water are (as shown by MAIER) readily explained by reference to the structure of the celestial temple, but it is not clear why or how these stones are associat- ed with the demonic chaos waters. The hekhalot writers' insistence that the waters are illusory also requires explanation: granted that the stones look like water, why should mistaking them for such reveal the mystic to be unworthy or, as babli puts it (in terms reminiscent of the Qumran literature) a \"speaker of lies?\" It is also necessary to clarify the meaning and relevance, in this context, of the reference to the golden calf story. GOLDBERG'S answers to these questions appear to have some merit, but require further clarification. HALPERIN'S interpretation, on the other hand, contains the plausible suggestion that the illusory nature of the waters is a mutation of the eariy tradition of the menacing chaos waters and reflects a characteristically rabbinic concern to protect the divine throne and temple from any implication of contamination by proximity to the forces of HALPERIN'S reconstruction of the early tradition is supported by the work of DAVILA, and the process of redactional modification that his theory implies is at least broadly consistent with DAN'S analysis.

HALPERIN has \"was .. standing\" in place of \"would ... stand up,\" but the word TWY, thus interpreted, is redundant. In this context, the \"one who looks like the '7nWti\" is almost certainly an exalted angel, who is responsible for determining whether or not the mystic is worthy to pro- ceed,j6 and who, perhaps, is required - like Meratron at the gate of the seuenrh in 3 Enoih 16:l-5 - to stand up when approached.\" 3. 73e Keepers ofthe Gate and the Saying: \"(Do Not) Enter''' In section C, it seems, in both HR and HZ, that the gatekeepers already know whether the nlxn 711' is worthy or unworthy, this having been determined in advance by the one who looks like inwn. Nonetheless, there are important differences between the two recensions. According to HZ:C2, one who is known to be unworthy is induced to enter and so led to his destruction. In most manuscripts of HR:C2, in contrast, he is forbidden to enter and only attacked when or if he ignores the pro- hibition: \"Do not enter!\" although a few witnesses agree with the HZ 34 h.Hag. 13b.

SCHAFER (ljbersetzung, 2, ibid.) reports that rns. Leiden 4730 of HR does in fact read: intun2 pY HlKl, \"I saw the eye of (the?) ?awn,\" but this does not justify HALPERIN'S speculations. 37 See p. 13, n. 64 and p. 28, n. 106 above, and the sources cited there. Also relevant may be the traditions concerning the title: \"Standing One\" (6 ko.rt5cjD'Yp) in Samaritanism and Sirnonian gnosticism, on which see FossffM, 7ke Name $God, 55-58 and 120-124. THE WATER VISION EPISODE AND ITS CONTEXT 61 reading: \"Enter!\" Close examination reveals, moreover, that the manu- scripts of HR:C2 contain several less obvious variations, which, though small in themselves, significantly affect the meaning of the narrative unit as a whole. These variations produce four distinct versions of the unit, apparently reflecting the different ways in which it was understood by the redactors and copyists who were responsible for its transmission. These four versions are presented for comparison on pages 62-63 be- low,'8 together with a single representative of the tiZ recension, which is different again.39 The starkest contrast is between the HZ recension and the version represented by HR(0). In HZ, the first invitation to enter is a delib erate deception. if the ?137%1 -171' is known to be worthy, the angels will induce him to refrain from responding to the summons, but if he is known to be unworthy, they will induce him to fall into the trap that has been prepared for him. Since the angels already know his status and control both his actions and their outcomes, the situation described is not a test, but the execution of a prior decision (presumably, of the one who looks like in~n).~O These two elements of predetermination and deliberate deception are entirely absent in HR(O), where, in C2, the unworthy iil31D receives a straightforward instruction to refrain from entering. Although he is known to be unworthy, there is no ind- ication that his fate is predetermined and we are told only that if he ignores the warning, the angels will attack him. By implication, it follows that if he were to heed the warning, no harm would come to him. Similarly, HR(0):Cl does not state that the invitation to enter is a test, or that the worthy 71131n 711' is induced not to enter, but simply that ifhe holds back he will be invited a second time and commended by the angels for having been appropriately reticent. This version, then, -~~ 38 O = ms. Oxford; W = ed. WERTHEIMER; M22 = ms. Munich 22; B = ms. Buda- pest. Mss. New York, Dro~sie, Munich 40, and Vatican 228 agree in all important respects with ms. Oxford. 39 Although variations are found in the manuscripts of HZ, they do not alter the structural meaning of the unit. Ms. Munich 22 is followed in the presentation below (words in parentheses from rns. New York). 40 Roughly the same point is made by DAN, \"3W'V $377 nn9,\" 198-199, but I cannot follow him in the inference that he draws from this, which appears to be based on an argument from silence. It is true that we are not told how the one Like ?awn decides whether or not the 813ln 111' is worthy, but this need not mean that the decision itself is therefore arbitrary.

The other three versions of HR represent positions falling between the extremes represented by HZ and HR(0). HR(M22):C2 intensifies the contrast between the two types of 7231~ 711' by stating that if the mystic is unworthy he wzll ignore the command to desist, with the consequences described. The element of deception reappears in HR(V(I? and in the primary text of HR(B), both of which read \"Enter!\" in C2. HRO is somewhat incoherent, but clearly intends us to understand that the unworthy ir23in 711' will enter at the first invitation, whereas the worthy 3231~ 17119 will not. The syntax of this version does not make it entirely clear whether this is a test of the i123in 711' or, as in HZ, the execution of a judgement previously made. Nor is it certain whether the doom of the unworthy 723172 711' is inevitable, although it seems that this is probably intended. HR(B) leaves no room for uncertainty on this point and is, moreover, the only one of these five versions to interpret the first invitation unambiguously as a test: 'ifhe was unworthy .... when they said to him \"Enter,\" then he entered.\" If, however, the variant reading noted by the copyist in C2 is followed, HR(B) corresponds to HR(M22). All of the significant differences between the HR recensions occur in section C2, HR:C1 being basically the same in a11 four cases. If the structural syntax of HR:C1 is reduced to its essentials, it expresses the thought: If one who was worthy .... did not enter .... they would praise him. HR(O):C2 provides a logical counterpoint to this: But if one who was not worthy .... did enter .... they would attack him. Each of the other three versions of HR:C2, however, expresses the following thought, which is also found in HZ:C2: THE WATER VISION EPISODE AND ITS CONTEXT 65 The syntactic logic of these versions thus requires that C1 be under- stood to mean: If one was worthy .... one would not enter .... and then they wouid praise him. This statement is not found in any version of HR:Cl. It does, however, correspond to the syntactic logic of HZ:Cl. It is, therefore, apparent that HRCW), HR(M22) and HR(B) combine the narrative logic of HR(0) in C1 with that of HZ in C2. Since this destroys the coherence of the account as a whole, it is safe to conclude that HR(O):Cl-2 represents the original form of this recension. The modifications that have occurred in the other versions are attributable to redactors whose understanding of the unit was influenced by that expressed in the HZ recension and/or the material in D-G. It is unlike- ly that HR:(O) is a modification of any other HR version, since all four begin with the same syntax in C1. HR(0) and HZ, then, represent two alternative versions of C1-2, both coherent in themselves, but embodying two very interpretations of the meaning of this unit. The decision as to which of these two recens- ions has ~riority is finely balanced. HALPERIN objects to the reading \"Do not Enter!\" in HR(O):C2 on the grounds that it is hard to lmaglne that any traveller to the merltabah, no matter how \"unworthy,\" could be so stupid as to disregard an expllcit command not to proceed.4' He concludes that HZ preserves the original tradition and that the alter- ation of \"Enter!\" to \"Do not enter!\" in HR(O):C2 (thus also most HR manuscripts42) was made by a copyist who was uncomfortable with the idea that the angels would attempt to deceive the i1231B 17117. This objection is not very convincing, since the theme of danger is a central feature of the i123ln tradition, in which stories such as this are clearly intended to warn about the consequences of disregarding the conditions and prohibitions with which the subject of the vision of the 713173 was surrounded. HALPERIN assumes, moreover, that the narrative describes But if one was unworthy .... one would enter .... and then they would attack him. 4 1 HALPERIN, Faces, 209. 42 See p. 61, n. 38 above."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"66 CHAPTER THREE a test of worthiness:' which the above analysis has shown not be the case in either HZ or the \"standard version\" of HR, as represented above by ms. Oxford. The narrative in HR(0) is simply a warning about what will happen if the 2331n 71t7 does disregard the instruction to desist. In other words, it is a cautionary tale with the straightforward moral that \"pride goes before a fall.\" In HZ, the words: \"they would influence his mind (7251 tl?n?l)\" are slightly awkward owing to the absence of a prepositional llnk with what follows (\"so that\"), which might perhaps suggest that these words may have been added in order to explain a text in which the formula of C1: \"Enter (D337)\" has mistakenly been repeat- ed in place of \"Do not Enter (01331 '7~)\" in C2. On the other hand, however, this change cannot be explained as a straightforward accidental omission, and there are grounds for suspecting that it may have been deliberate. The reading \"enter\" in C2 is, on the face of things, Zectio dt@ciltor and HALPERIN may be right to associate this version with the biblical and midrashic traditions that God \"hardened the hearts\" of the Egyptians at the Red Sea in order to lead them to destru~tion.~~ HALPERIN also finds a talmudic parallel which, if valid, strongly supports the priority of HZ and sheds light on its meaning: according to b.Ber. 34a, one who is asked to \"pass before the Ark\" ('195 121Y2 7lPI7) and lead the prayers of the community in the synagogue should at the first invitation refuse this privilege and only afterwards accept. Referring to SCHOLEM'S suggestion that the puzzling expression 717 81131135 may be based on the standard rabbinic expression 7195 717 71PI;1,45 HALPERIN suggests that in HZ:C \".... the etiquette of the synagogue ritual is transferred to the approach to the Divine Thr~ne.\"~~ The validity of this parallel is supported by the facts that the sixth 53'77 corresponds to the sanctuary of the temple and that the 7131)3 711' therefore assumes a quasi-priestly role.47 43 Although HALPERIN bases his translation of HR:Al-C2 on ms. Oxford, his understanding of the meaning of the narrative corresponds to the version in ms. Munich 22. In HZ, he takes C1-C2 to be a test, rather than the execution of a prior decision.

THE WATER VISION EPISODE AND ITS CONTEXT 67 1 It is, perhaps, not possible to achieve a final resolution of this i problem at this stage of our inquiry. The clarity and simplicity of structure of HR(O) seems at first sight to support the suspicion that this version may have preserved the structural meaning, at least, of the original tradition. There are, however, very good grounds for the i decision that HZ has priority and that HR(O) is, in reality, a false \"correction\" of this difficult text. Evidence to be considered below suggests, moreover, that the reading \"do not enter\" in C2 was known at an early stage of the HR textual traditionP8 4. The Keepers of the Gate in the Ascent oJ Rabbi Netjtlnya b. Ha-Qanah The penalty inflicted on the unworthy mystic (C2) is different in the I two recensions. At this point, despite the one uncertain word in the HZ man~scripts,~~ there are compelling reasons for attributing priority to HZ. HR's strange and unexplained statement that the angels \"throw $711 71T113 at him\" appears to be an awkward combination of two elem- ents borrowed from the following material: 1'j'~n in HR:D1 and D4; and 5511 '1TIn in HR and HZ:D4. The expression hill ?lTX itself has not, to my knowledge, been satisfactorily explained. The word >fl2 simply means iron, while tfln evidently refers to some kind of cutting implement.50 The significance of this expression may, perhaps, be explained by reference to b.B.Qam. 81b, where \"to split the joints with an iron implement (Aramaic: K?T~E)I~ K151)\" is a metaphor for excom- munication. In the context of the heavenly temple, moreover, the reference to iron seems to carry a clear implication of ritual impurity.5' I It is interesting to compare this with the account in HR of what happens when Nehunya b. Ha-Qanah, in the course of his visionary ascent, arrives at the gate of the sixth $3'3. Nehunya, who has entered into a self-induced state of trance, is using automatic speech to tell his 48 See p. 73 below. 49 See p. 55, n. 8 above.

He inserted it into a myrtle twig filled with nard oil, which had been soaked in pure basalm, and they laid it on the knees of R. Nellunya b. Ha-Qanah. At once, he was dismiss- ed from before the throne of glory, where he had been sitting and beholding a wondrous pride and a strange dominion, an exalted pride and a sublime dominion, which wells up before the throne of glory, three times each day, on high, from the time that the world was created until now, for praise. 18.4a And we asked h~m: Who is he who is \"of those that descend to the ;1131n, but not of those who descend to the ;1131D!\" 18.4b He said to us: These are the men whom those who descend to the i1231n take and place above them, and make them sit before them, and say to them, \"Observe, see, listen and write down everything that 1 say and everything that we hear before the throne of glory.\" And if those men are not worthy of this, the guardians of the gateway to the sixth palace attack them. Take care, then, that you choose for yourself suitable men who are tried and tested members of the fellowship. This passage, which has been the subject of several studies:' contains several problems. The syntax of the first sentence of section 17.6, which appears to consist entirely of an extended relative clause, is clearly defective. In order to create a main clause, the conjunction \"and\" (in parentheses) before \"they were flogged\" has to be disregarded, although it is present in all the manuscripts. Alternatively, the conjunction ceases to be troublesome if the opening expression, -V) '19)3, is disregarded: The guardians of the sixth palace used to destroy those who descended to the ;1331n, but not those who descended to the ;1231n without permission, and about whom they had been commanded, and they were flogged and burned, and others were set in their place. 17 LAWKENCE H.

Nehunya is then recalled from his trance to explain what this puzzling expression means. As observed by DAN, however, his explanation is both inadequate and inconsistent with 17.6, where it is clear that \"worthiness\" provides no protection against the gatekeepers' attacks.58 In fact, the whole sequence is based on a misunderstanding of 17.6 and quite clearly belongs to a subsequent stage of literary act- ivity. The real meaning of 17.6 is that the gatekeepers, contrary to their proper function, destroy the properly authorized ii231n '711' but do not destroy the 7231)3 '711' who lack permission (for what and from whom are not stated at this point). Although there is nothing in the present context of the passage to explain this strange statement, DAN argues that it belongs to the earliest layer of tradition about gate of the sixth ?Y?. In his opinion, the sixth gateway represents the boundary of the divine world, where the heavenly traveller is exposed to the terri- fying, chaotic powers of the demonic realm, which are beyond the cont- rol of justice and of reason.59 In the narrative produced by this misunderstanding, the method used by Ishmael to recall Nehunya from his trance is significant to this study. He evidently intends Nehunya to be dismissed from the presence of the divine Glory in the heavenly temple, but does not want him to be expelled from the holy place so abruptly as to cause him injury. His solution is to bring Nehunya's body into contact with the faintest poss- ible trace of impurity and, as will emerge in the course of this inquiry, the form of impurity chosen is by no means incidental. The degree of uncleanness contracted through indirect contact with the questionable 773, which is so weak as to be negligible in an ordinary human situat- ion, is further attenuated by layers of \"insulating\" material of the highest purity. This merest hint or suspicion of impurity is, however, enough to cause Nehunya to be immediately expelled from the heavenly world, albeit in a gentle, controlled manner which contrasts markedly with the violent rejection of one who mistakes the marble stones for water. The criterion of ritual purity thus seems to have been a signif- 58 DAN, \"~w~w $373 nno,\" 208. 59 Ibid., 206-208, 215.

The Strange Expression: %ecause .... \" Turning to the HR recension of the water vision episode itself, sections Dl4 state that the guardians of the palace pretend to throw water at the mystic but that this water is an illusion. If he is deceived into asking about the nature of the waters, he betrays himself as unworthy and is condemned. We are not, however, told why this should be so and the passage does not help us to understand either Aqiba's warning in bublr (All-19) or the corresponding material in the HZ(N) recension of the 1 Of13 story (B2a-b). There does not seem to be any intrinsic or causal connection between the \"Enter/Do not enter!\" incident in C1-2 and the water vision episode in D14, and the two must therefore be regarded as originally independent units of tradition6' This being so, the expr- ession -V '1373 in Dl is again rather puzzling, as it is in HR 17.6. AS translated on p. 56 above, the expression refers forwards (\"Because the guardians .... throw .... and if he should say .... then they throw ....\" etc.) but this is rather forced and the expression really seems redundant. According to both HR:D and HZ:D, in apparent contrast to HR/E-iZ:C, I the guardians do not seem to know in advance whether the n331n 771' is worthy. In the HR recension, where the illusion of water is produced by the guardians, it clearly functions as a test. As we have seen, HR includes two blocks of material concerning the I sixth gate and its guardians: Nehunya's encounter with the destructive gatekeepers (17.6-18.4); and the sequence which includes the encounter with the \"one like >nun,\" the \"Enter/Do not enter!\" incident, and the water vision episode (25.5-6). These two passages occur at different I points in a narrative sequence which constitutes the final portion of HR in its present form (excluding the ;rim ltr, appendix).

If this correspondence is not merely coincidental, several considerations support the view that HZ(N) has priority at this point. In addition to the awkwardness of -rt, 71313 in HR, it is unlikely that the redactor of HZ(N) has adopted the expression from HR and changed it to the more ambiguous -W 11'3, since either expression makes nonsense of his sent- ence. It is therefore probable that -w 7173 in HZ(N):Dl is a scribal error arising from the occurrence of the same word in the previous paragraph (Cl-2) and that the redactor of HR, faced with the meaningless sentence which resulted from this mistake, has attempted to make sense of it by (a) interpreting -v 1173 (in this instance) in the sense: \"because\"; (b) changing it to the unambiguous -w 713)3 to make this meaning clear and to distinguish it from the previous occurrences of -W 11'3, meaning \"when\"; (c) dropping the opening words of the HZ version ('lW7W8 53'3 i7XX 378); and (d) explaining that the implicit \"they\" of HZ(N): lSfllD (changed in HR to l&.Vni phn) refers to the angelic guardians. If the expression -W 733n at HR 17.6 indicates a link with HR 25.6 (= Dl), as suggested above, then HR 25.6, which is derivative at this point of HZ(N), must in turn have priority over HR 17.6. The uncertain word in the remaining HZ mss. appears to mean \"to someone who\" (in D and M40) or \"by/with someone who\" (in M22 and 0). The doubtful letter 1 should certainly be read as the graphically similar 3, meaning \"as\" or \"like.\" On this basis, HALPERIN translates as follows: The s~xth palace looked ltlce someone [!I at whom a hundred thousand thousands and myriad rnyr~ads of waves of the sea were be~ng driven ....''I This, of course, makes no sense at all.

In fact, the emended text of HZ(M22), reading '733 for 'n1, corresponds closely to WERTHEIMER'S version of HR: I-IZ(M22): And the gate of the sixth palace HR: Because the guardians of the gate of the sixth palace HZ(M22): looked like someone who pn3 ZXf3 ;i';i) were driving at him HRCXI): were acting iike ones who D'VlY ?'Z) were throwing upon him HZ(M22): .... waves of the sea .... HRO: .... waves of water .... The most immediately obvious explanation of this similarity is that WERTHEIMER'S text has priority. In this case, HZ(M22) has lost the words: \"Because the guardians of ...,\" with the result that the subject has become \"the gate\" which is (a) singular and (b) incapable of acting, hence the alteration of U'UlY 172 (\"were acting\") to 2K13 3'2 (\"was seen\" or \"seerned\"). As indicated by the remaining mss. of HZ, \".... the gate of ....\" was subsequently lost, so that the subject became \"the sixth palace.\" This reconstruction, however, contradicts the conclusion reach- ed above that HZ is, at this point, the earlier source. I therefore suggest that the redactor of HRO has added the words DSUIY 1'3 in an attempt to make sense of the difficult word '733 (\"like someone who\"), which he found at this point in his source - namely, the version pre- served in HZ(M22) and, less clearly, HZ (0). Two further considerations support this hypothesis. In the first place, it is unlikely that NR's ?'$Y (~'ll'iw73l) ~\"7'073 (\"throw [and hurl] upon him\") has been changed to HZ'S 12 'j77110, which is lectzo dz@cilior for two reasons: firstly because 12 (%/with him/itV) is, if the HR recen- sion is presupposed, much less appropriate than 13~ (\"upon,\" \"at,\" or \"against him\") and secondly because the verb 71D, where it occurs in connection with water, is elsewhere either intransitive or, where transit- ive, normally has water (or waves) as its subject, not its object?' In 81 Adm~ttedly, 71D 1s used of the effect of wind on water at HR 9:l (SCHAFER, Synopse, $162; cf. WERTHEIMER, n)W77M )n3, 1.85, $10.4; full quotation on p. 211 below). Even here, however, the verb does not take the waves (1U'Wln 753) as I~S dlrect other words, the verb usually refers to the movement of water in and of itself. Again, if the priority of HR is to be maintained, the verb must here be understood to be transitive, having \"waves of the sea (or water)\" as its object, as in HALPERIN'S translation. SCHOLEM'S translation avoids this difficulty, but is unsatisfactory in other respects. Both SCHOLEM and HALPERIN understand 12 to refer to the 723173 711'. The word recurs, however, in the following clause, where it can only refer to the palace: tl7n nnK 23'0 15?3? I2 j7K1 (neither SCHOLEM nor HALPERIN account for the word at this point).82 All these difficulties are resolved if the doubtful word in HZ is assumed to be la3 (\"like\"). The translation offered on page 56 above is based on this emendation, which has been accepted by most translat- or~.~~ The outcome is a perfectly comprehensible sentence in which 1'711D assumes its most natural, intransitive meaning and 12 refers back to the palace, as it does in the following clause: The sixth palace looked as if (-W 1133) .... waves of the sea were billowing in it (13 7~1113) ....84 It has become apparent that the HR recension is confused at the point of transition between C2 and Dl, where a redactor has attempted to resolve the difficulties posed by a corrupt text of E-IZ:Dl. It follows that the I-iZ recension must have priority in D. HR's statement that the gatekeepers are responsible for throwing the illusory water at the 323173 7117 is a product of the confused transition and distorts the significance of what follows. In HZ:Dl, the illusion of water is not produced by the guardians, but is a feature of the palace itself, produced by the appearance of marble stones. The illusion is dangerous, since it provides an opportunity for error, whereby the 2231n 71'1' may betray object, being related to them by the preposition -3. ~>YII is a masculine noun, despite the misleading plural form. See BDB (1977), 228a-b and JASTROW, Dictionary, 345b. 83 Thus, in addition to SCHOLEM, SCHAFER, ~bersefzun~, 146, and REICHMAN, 'Die \"Wasser-Episode,\"' 70. \" Thus the translation on p. 56 above.

There is no indication that the question of the unworthy (7231n 7117 is predetermined, or prompted by the angels, and the episode does not seem to involve the execution of a prior decision, as in HZC. A careful reading of the text reveals, moreover, that in E-IZ:D-F the 7231B 71'17 is no longer standing outside the sixth gate, as he is in HR. In HZ:D3, the 517 n2 comes forth from the seventh 5377, and in E2 we are told that the 7131n 7115 has already been admitted to \"the (first) six n1'7377.\" If we accept the narrative unity that the redactor of this recension has imposed on this sequence, the 7231n 7117, having been found worthy and permitted to enter (C), is now standing inside the sixth 535ir.85 This point, although it may, perhaps, seem at first sight to be relatively minor, profoundly affects the significance of the episode, as will emerge below.

Conclusion: The Water Ksion Episode and the Paradise Tradition The few commentators who have attempted a detailed investigation of the relationships between the HR and HZ versions of these materials have come to different conclusions. HALPERIN believes that FIZ has priority in A-C, but that HR's version of D, the water vision episode itself, is older than that in HZa7 REICHMAN treats HR:D and HZ:D as independent developments of a pre-literary source tradition (A-C are 85 In E-F, unless this passage is hopelessly confused, nnD2 must presumably mean \"inside the gate.\" See further below. 86 Since the only clear reference to the keepers of the sixth gate in either recension ofA-D occurs at the beginning of HR:Dl, where the text of this recension is confused, it might be possible to conclude that they are alien to the whole sequence and to attribute their appearance to the contaminating influence of HR 17.6. I am unwilling to go this far, for two reasons: firstly, because it would undercut my strong suspicion that HR 17.6 is a garbled reference to 25.6 (= C); and secondly, and more importantly, because -W '33n at HR 25.6 (= Dl) has been found to have priority over -W '33n at HR:17.6, and it is not possible to separate this expression from the keepers of the sixth gate. 87 HALPERIN, Faces, 204-208. ME WATER VISION EPISODE AND ITS CONTEXT 79 I outside the scope of his inquiry).88 The above analysis has, however, confirmed DAN'S judgement that the whole of HR:A-D, including the water vision episode, is a confused and abbreviated version of the older HZ re~ension.'~ HALPERIN, who wrongly attributes priority to HR:D, proposes the following reconstruction of the tradition history of the water vision epi- sode: Aqiba's warning at b.Hag. 14b: 'Do not say, \"Water, Water ...,\"' is an allusion to the early tradition about this episode; HR 25.6 (= D) is an independent witness to the same tradition; the redactor of babli also included a reference to the \"pure marble stones\" of the heavenly temple, which are not mentioned'in HR:D and are not part of the water vision episode in its earliest form; subsequently, the redactor of HZ:D inter- preted HR:D in the light of babli, and vice versa, and inferred that the \"marble stones\" were those of the sixth 5377; finally, the references to these stones in the HZ(N) version of the 6113 story (B2a-b) represent a further stage in this process of 'mutual contamination of the pardes story and the \"water\" test.\"' The finding that HZD has priority over HR:D undermines this unnecessarily complicated reconstruction and indicates a much simpler set of relationships between these texts. In HZD, the pavement of marble stones is clearly an integral component of the narrative, which makes no reference to the story of the four who entered 6773. The image of the marble stones is derived from the tradition of the heavenly sanctuary, to which the sixth 539il corresponds, and can be traced at least as far back in time as 1 Enoch 14. There is, j therefore, no reason to assume that the redactor of HZ:D has borrowed I this image from babli. It is both simpler and more reasonable to concl- I ! ude that the marble stones and the saying, \"water\" in babli are both I allusions to the water vision episode and that they were derived from a ! single source in the tradition represented by NED. HALPERIN discerns a reference to the talmudic 6713 story in HZ:F, I where he prefers the variant reading of ms. New York (Flb): \"Ben Azzai\" for \"a certain person.\"91 He justifies this preference on the grounds that the majority version 88 REICHMAN, 'Die 'Wasser-Episode,\"' 69-97. 89 DAN, ''~W~~U 43~ nm,\" 210-11. 90 HALPERIN, Faces, 204-208 (quotation, 206). 91 See p. 57, n. 21 above."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"80 CHAPTER THREE .... leaves the anecdote completely pointless and is best explained as an alteration by scribes who did not want to attribute to the saintly Ben Azzai a fate reserved for the descendants of calf-worshippers.92 A circular logic underlies this argument: the variant reading is preferred on the assumption that bablz has priority over HZ, and then cited as evidence in support of that assumption. The motive that HALPERIN attributes to the copyist is, moreover, unconvincing, since one affected by this scrupie could easily have adopted the widely attested talmudic alternative: \"Ben Z~ma.\"~~ It is much more probable that the copyist of HZ(N):F has identified the unnamed person with Ben Azzai on the basis of the talmudic version of the 0'713 story. It should further be noted that this change occurs only in ms. New York, which is also the only source, other than babli, to connect the 0713 story with the water vision episode.94 Most commentators, including HALPERIN, believe on the basis of perceived narrative inconsistencies that the material in HZ:E-F was added at a later stage of literary development than that represented by HZ:D. HALPERIN bases his case on the observation that HZ:E, where the unworthy il331D 711' can apparently fool the angels, is inconsistent with HZ:C, where they know his status in advanceY5 This, however, is irrelevant unless we grant HALPERIN'S assumption that HZ:C-D are a single unit of tradition. This is unlikely to be the case, since, as observed above, the two units are inconsistent: in HZ:C, the angels know in advance whether the ill3ln 7117 is worthy or unworthy, but in HZD, they do not. DAN regards FEE and HZ:F as two separate units. In his opinion, HZ:E represents a redactor's attempt to moderate the \"arbitrariness and harshness\" of HZ:D, whereas these qualities are, if anything, exacerbated in HZF. He considers it possible that HZ:D and HZ:F are a single unit, into which HZ:E has been interpolated?' REICHMAN maintains that the \"forbidden utterance\" motif in HZ:E-F 92 HALPERIN, Faces, 533, note g.

THE WATER VISION EPISODE AND ITS CONTEXT 8 1 is inconsistent with the meaning of the \"test\" in NED, as he wrongly understands it.97 We should certainly allow for the possibility that the text of HZ:D- F was expanded over time. The narrative structure of these units is not, however, disjointed or discontinuous, as these scholars have maintained. If the majority reading: '11n5~ 71153 is followed in HZ:Flb, the narrative sequence in H2:E-F is, in fact, an internally consistent development of HZ:D2:8 where the unworthy ;7231%I 7117 betrays himself as such by asking the question: \"These waters: what is the nature of them?\" The unidentified unfortunate of HZ:F does not ask this question, but merely says the word \"water\" twice. This is consistent with HZ:El, which warns that one should not \"ask, or say that they are water.\" The mean- ing appears to be that, even if one does not ask the question, merely to say the word the word \"water\" is enough to cause disaster. HEE makes the point that, even if one is unworthy, one may avoid discovery if one refrains from mentioning water, and HEF provides the counterpoint to this: even though the unnamed 223173 '7117 \"was worthy,\" he made the mistake of saying \"water7' and, for this reason, was assaulted by the angels. The meaning of itll ?nu .... 175~ 17;731 (HZ:Flb) is obscure, and the variant in ms. New York: 1'5~ l'>?bi~~ is almost certainly an attempted clarification of this strange reading. The verb i5ui-i does not occur anywhere else in the HZ recension and it is possible that the copyist of HZ(N) has been influenced by HR, where l75'bb occurs in C2, Dl and D4. We have observed, however, that each occurrence of this verb in HR is at a point of narrative and textual confusionY9 It seems more likely, therefore, that the redactor of HR has taken the verb from the variant reading in HZ(N):Flb (compare l'3'5t~n in HR:Dl, which is a product of the same confusion and has almost certainly been taken from EIZ:C2). If this is correct, HZ:F has priority over HR:C-D. These narrative and textual considerations indicate that the sequence HZ:E-F, though possibly later than HZ:D, nonetheless represents a relat- ively early stage in the development of the literary tradition. Whether this be so or not, the crucial point to be made in this connection is 97 REICHMAN, 'Die \"Wasser-Episode,\"' 91-97. 98 Contra HALPERIN, DAN and REICHMAN (see the previous three notes). 99 See pp. 67 and 74-77 above."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"82 CHAPTER THREE that in all of HZ:A-F there is no single element that requires to be expl- ained by reference to babli.

New York, is there any point of direct contact between the HZ recension of the water vision episode and the story of the four who entered 0713. Returning to the hekhalot version of that story (pages 12-14 above), it has been observed that, although sections A and C reflect the pre-talmudic version, the material common to all four manuscripts in B is derived from a talmudic source which, since it mentions neither water nor marble stones, is unlikely to be babli. At B2a and B2b, however, ms. New York of HZ interpolates into this text material which can only be derived from the water vision episode according to the HZ recension, which we have found to be independent of and prior to babli In other words, the redactor of the O712 story in HZ(N) has interpreted it in the light of the water vision episode, which is described elsewhere in the HZ collection, and there is no reason to suppose that he has been influenced at this point by babli. It is very probable, therefore, that the context in which the story of the four first came to be associated with the water vision episode was the relatively late literary tradition represented by HZ(N), and that this tradition was employed as a source by the redactor of the O719 story in badli.

In SCHOLEM'S opinion, supported by GRUENWALD, HZ is \"the oldest [hekhalot] text available to us.\"' The contents of this loosely organized collection are extremely diverse, prompting SCHOLEM to remark that \"the text of the Lesser I-Iekhalot as it is preserved is something of a hodgepodge.'\" The title Hekhalot Zutarti is derived from Hai Gaon's well-known responsum on the story of the four, which cites the water vision episode according to the text of HZ:DI.~ JELLINEK identified an untitled portion of ms. Oxford 1531, following HR, as the text which Hai Gaon calls HZ4 The collection is not called by this title in any extant manuscript, although SCHOLEM reported that he saw the title in an Italian manu- script which, unfortunately, was lost during World War 11.5 ELIOR observes that the materials identified as HZ by JELLINEK do not const- itute a coherent or clearly defined text: ' SCHOLEM, Malor Trends, 45; and see further, rbzd., 358, n. 15; and mdem, Jmrsh Gnostrasm, 75-83; cf.

This author [i.e., ELIOR] sees them as most probably representing various mystical traditions from different circles of Yordi Merkava, copied in a haphaz- ard manner with no attempt to attain textual unity. Hekhalot Zutarti should not be considered as an unfolding narrative or book but rather different forms of literature which grew from a nucleus of idea, situation, or perhaps a true mystical experience and to which has beer] grafted, with the passing of time, other similar traditions and new material. If these passages must be seen as a unit, then their nucleus must be the well known archetypical mystical experience of Rabbi Altiva - the four who entered the orchard - since their uniqueness is obviously founded on the visionaryexper- lence. However, it is doubtful that at any time these parts were truly compiled to- gether in a more coherent manner than we now possess? SCHAFER'S detailed analysis of the materials included in HZ results in an even more radical deconstruction of the text than that proposed by ELIOR.' Owing to its lack of internal organization, the fluidity of the manuscripts, and a high degree of textual overlap with other hekhalot and midrashic collections, it is, in SCHAFER'S opinion, not possible to determine the specific content and precise boundaries of the collection: On grounds of neither content nor formal criteria is it possible to define a \"text\" which can properly be so called, as possessing any kind of unified redactional structure. The designation of this textual complex as HZ is a convention which quite obviously originated in an attempt to give a name to the materials which follow HR in the manuscripts, and to distinguish those materials from HR itself. This phenomenon of the delimitation of textual units as Rabhah and Zuta' is sufficiently well known from the midrashic literature, where the text designated Zuta' should more often than not be regarded as redactionally the later. \"Hekhalor Zutarti' thus turns out to be a classic example of a fictitious text, which apparently never existed as a redactional Elsewhere, SCH~~FER observes, in partial agreement with ELIOR, that the first part of the HZ collection (Synapse, 55335-374) appears to have coal- ELIOR, ~-tn-~u)~ n)=)3);1 (English summary), ii-iii.

While it may be true that, in SCHAFER'S words, \"of all the anal- yzed macroforms of the Ilekhalot literature, Heirhalot Zufartz is the least hom~genous,\"~' this is only a matter of degree. As SCHAFER is at pains to point out, the entire hekhalot corpus is made up of more or less loosely organized and frequently overlapping compilations (\"macro- forms\") of quite variegated textual material^.'^ In this respect, the I hekhalot compilations are not markedly different from the \"main- stream\" talmudic and midrashic collections. These too are composite documents, the contents of which are derived from a variety of sources and, in many cases, \"migrate\" freely from one collection to another. Although these sources may, in most cases, have been subjected to a more systematic process of organization and redaction than the majority of the hekhalot compilations, this again is a matter only of degree.

On the contrary, a detailed source-critical and tradit:n:l- historical inquiry into the origins and development of these 1iteri.y streams may yield important new insights about the original meanings and Sitze im Leben of the textual units, and about the redactional agendas which shaped the literary sequences and longer collections in which they are combined. Thus, while the notion of HZ as a single text should clearly be abandoned, this does not prevent us from inquiring into the sources and stages of formation of the HZ literary tradition. AS we have seen, SCHAFER believes that the collection came to be known by the title HZ because it was appended in the manuscripts to HR. For this reason, he is inclined to think that HZ represents a later phase of editorial activity than NR.\" His suggestion about the origin of the title HZ is entirely plausible, but the fact that the HZ materials were appended to fiR by the copyists of these relatively late manuscripts proves nothing about their dates of origin. Arguably, the collection's looseness of structure and lack of redactional definition are grounds for supposing that it may, at least in part, represent an early stage in the literary development of the hekhalot tradition.

We have found, moreover, that the redact- or of babli has been influenced by a source in which the D\"f9 story and the water vision episode had already been brought into contact with one another, and that this source, preserved in HZ(N), was part of the same complex of developing literary traditions. SCHAFER has observed that the opening paragraph of HZ (Synopse, 5335) contains several echoes of m.t-lag. 2.1, the lemma of the mystical c~llection,'~ and this paragraph is separated from \"Four Entered Paradise\" only by a short account of the revelation of God's secret name to Moses and Aqiba during their ascents to heaven.\" It is therefore very possible, as I observed in my previous study of the 0779 story, that the context in which that story first came to be associated with m.t-lag. 2.1 (or its source) was an early version of HZ, or, to put the matter differently, that the layer of tradit- ion in which that association first occurred has been preserved in this colle~tion.'~ In this qualified sense, these findings tend to support SCHOLEM'S and GRUENWALD'S estimation of the antiquity of HZ. At the very least, this stew of traditions contains substantial morsels of pre- talmudic ;rl3in 7wyn material. The evidence considered above suggests strongly, moreover, that, even before the talmudic redactors dipped their spoons in it, it had already started cooking. 2.

The forinuia occurs in the standard daily liturgy as part of the morning service and is also included in the confession of faith to be made at the point of dying.23 Its significance in the context of the water vision episode is surely derived from the biblical settings of two of its three components. The perfect-tense form T>Q i-rli~ occurs at the beginning of Psalms 93, 97 and 99, the first of which reads as follows: pas he LORD reigns; he is clothed wlth majesty The LORD 1s robed; he is glrded with power.

THE CELESTIAL PAVEMENT AND THE \"ASCENT MIDRASH\" IN HZ 89 the .Song of Moses,\" which recounts and celebrates the events of the Red Sea crossing and the destruction of Pharaoh and his host. Thus far, then, HALPERIN'S explanation of the general background of the water vision episode is well supported, and his ground-breaking research has significantly advanced our understanding of this material. His analysis of the textual tradition has, however, been found to be flawed, and our finding that the HZ version of the episode has priority over that in HR raises problems for his theory. The image of an assault on the heavenly traveiler by the chaos waters (whether real or illusory) may, perhaps, have colored HR's presentation of the episode, but it is nowhere to be detected in the earlier HZ recension. A more precisely nuanced interpretation of the imagery and specific terminolon of this version is, therefore, now required. 3. T%e Celestial Paving Stones The iUsv 71z8 are, as is now widely recogn~zed, a standard feature of the earthly and, by extension, the celestial temple.24 At 1 Chr. 29:2, the expression occurs at the end of a list of materials bequeathed by David to Solomon, to be used in the building of the temple (interestingly enough, the list also includes >TD, despite the later ban on iron in the temple).'' Along with these materials, David also gives Solomon the plans according to which the temple is to be built (1 Chr 28:ll-19). It is very possible that this passage is the basis of the myth of the revelat- ion of the ?Tin 7W to the returning exiles, as described in HR 29:3-6.'6 Here God, who wishes to give a gift to Israel in compensation for their recent suffering, recites a similar list of precious materials which he possesses in heaven but, since all these things are already to be found in the worid beiow, decides that what they really need are the secret names of the ?~'IR lw. Although tV7~ is not included in this list of treasures, the connection with 1 Chr. 28:ll-29:5 is confirmed by what follows. The W-tli'??~ rill descends and appears on the throne of glory to the elders of the people \"from the great gateway of the house of the 24 See pp. 36-44 above.

A further point of contact between the scriptural passage and the hekh- alot tradition occurs at 1 Chr. 29:1, where David calls Solomon \"youth\" (W), a title of the angelic vice-regent, usually identified as Metatron, according to 3 Enoch and several ;lnli;, llY7W sources.29 The term W1Z' (= W7W; \"alabaster\" or \"white marble\") occurs twice at Esther 1:6, with reference to the pillars and mosaic pavement of King Ahasuerus' palace, and once at Cant. 5:15, where the legs of the Beloved are compared to marble columns (WW '71DY). Of more direct relevance to this study is the following passage of HR 9.5:30 For in the place where they praise him, there shine, glisten, glitter, gleam and sparlcle (?) topaz, onyx, sapphire, carbuncle, emerald and pure marble. The language of this passage clearly echoes the HZ recension of the water vision episode. In addition to the 11713 W\"W, the word 17Kn may be a slightly distorted echo of the expression, 17T 171Nn in HZ.Dl?'

See pp. 93-96 below. THE CELESTIAL PAVEMENT AND THE \"ASCENT MIDRASH\" IN HZ 91 not really fit this context and is probably derived, directly or indirectly, from HZ'S description of the sixth ~alace, where the pure marble stones resemble water in which waves of the sea are billowing (791ll~)?~ All this material confirms what we already know, namely, that marble is an important feature of the heavenly and earthly temples, and that this precious substance appears to resemble water, but it does not seem at first sight, to convey much further information. We should not, how- ever, overlook the significance of a detail found in HZ:Dl, repeated in HR 9.5 and bablz (A13). According to these sources, the substance of the stones is said to be 11;1U, that is, uncontaminated by levitical un- cleanness. In this connection, it is interesting to observe that in HR, when Nehunya b. Ha-Qanah makes his visionary journey through the seven n1'757~1, he is said to be seated \"at the (great) third gateway of the temple\" ('i[ nvU ~vK 'w'?w~-[ [ilflr'l] 712n?), on \"a bench of pure marble (1liTu v7W >W '1030),\" which is the inherited property of R. Ish- mael, the priest.33 The (great) third gateway of the temple is, according to some manuscripts, also the location of the appearance of the holy spirit in the ;inn ltu myth:4 where it appears to be the entrance to the sanctuary building, to which the gate of the sixth '73'8 corresponds. If Nehunya is indeed seated at the entrance to the sanctuary, priestly status is clearly attributed to him. Another parallel is suggested by HR 19.3, where Nehunya tells his listeners that \"Prince Dumiel, the threshold- guardian at the right of the gate of the sixth '735;1, sits on a bench of pure stone [?] (11213 j?lns> >W '709~ >y ~wV).\"\" At all events, the substance of \"pure marble\" appears in the context of Nehunya's ascent to be associated with the conditions of extreme cultic and priestly, or 32 See pp. 74-77 above. 33 HR 14.2; SCHAFER, Synopse, 9202; WERTHEIMER, n)W'77D )R2, 1.91, 316.2. \"Great\" is lacking in mss.

A key to the meaning of the water vision episode is provided by the expression 43'311 ~I??>u in HZ:Dl, repeated in HZ:EZ and also in the I?Z(N) recension of the O7f9 story (B2a). HALPERIN, who finds this expression puzzling, guesses that it means \".... built into the palace.\"36 SCHOLEM, presumably associating the expression with the description of the marble facing stones of the Jerusalem sanctuary in b.Sukk. 51b and B.B. 4a,37 offers: \".... with which the palace was te~sellated.\"~~ In biblical Hebrew, the verb 5'70 means \"to lift or cast up.\"39 It is used at Isa. 57:14 and 62:lO of \"raising up\" (i.e. making or paving) a road. At Jer. 18:15, the expression ;I>?~P ~'7 717 means \"an unpaved road.\" Prov. 15:19 states that the path of the righteous is ;i>?>~ (RSV: \"a level highway\"). In rabbinic Hebrew, 5'70 can mean either \"to tread, press, make a path, or pave,\" or \"to be light (of weight),\" in which case the participle means \"high,\" \"light\" or \"swinging.\"40 It is probable that both of these meanings are intended here, but the primary refer- ence must be to the pavement of the heavenly sanctuary.4' A further dimension of meaning is provided by t.Miqwabt 3.4, where '714~ occurs as a dialect form of hi^, meaning \"clear\" or \"transparent\" (of water). This word is used by Rashi (on Hag. 14b), who explains that the stones were \"shining like clear water7' (1'51'7~ D7)3> i7>311n), and by Hai Gaon, who appears to misquote HZ: 53'33 niii'7r (\"transparent like the pal- ace\").42 HALPERIN finds this strange, because the word \"is normally used of liquids.\"43 Hananael b. Hushiel explains Aqiba's warning in babli by reference to the water vision episode. He cites only HR by name and quotes the opening words of HR:Dl, but also includes a part of the text of HZ:D1, which he attributes to Aqiba, misquoting the word nl'71'70: 36 See HALPERIN, Faces, 201, 204, and 533, note e. 37 See p. 36 above. 38 SCHOLEM, Major Trendx, 53; rdem, Jrwlsh Gnosrlmm, 15. 39 See BDB, 699b-700b. 40 See JASTROW, Drcttona~, 995a-b. 41 Compare m.Sot 2.2, which states that the earthly sanctuary was paved with marble flagstones. See p. 83, n. 3 above. 43 HALPERIN, Fam, 533, note e. And R. Aqiba commanded thern: When you come to look, in the depth of your mind, towards the stones of pure marble, do not say, 'Water! Water!\" for there is no water there at at1 - but a worldly image (~'7~3 nln?) is seen and he who says, \"Water!\" is thrust away, for he has been found to be a liar. It is explained in these terms in FirRhaiot Rahhati: Because the guardians of the gate of the sixth palace cast and throw a thousand thousand waves ofwater when there is not so much as a drop there. R. Aqiba said: It seems as though there are waves of water in it (D7 351 11 &W ?%I:, ;iN?>), but there is not so much as a single drop in it, but only the brilliant air (IT 1'18) of the pure marble stones which are included within the palace (53331 nl>h:, Iilw), the brilliance of the appearance of which was like water. And he who says, \"These waters: what is the nature of them (3n ]27t3)?\" is thrust away .... et~.~~ Returning to FIZ:D1 itself, HALPERIN also finds the expression 1'T l'lHn incomprehensible He therefore argues that the reading of ms New York: l'T f1Kn (\"light of the brilliance\") should be preferred'5 If this were correct, it would mean that HZ:El, E2 and Flb, and HZ(N):B2a of the 0119 story, all of which read either 171K 177 (\"brilliance of air\") or 1'7 l?K (\"air of brilliance\"), must be based on the supposedly corrupt text of HZ:Dl. The reading of the majority of the witnesses is, how- ever, kctio dficzlior, and it is hard to account for an arbitrary alteration of \"light,\" which is naturally associated with \"brilliance,\" to \"air,\" which normally is not. DEUTSCH finds a parallel to the expression 1'78 l'T/?'T ?Ti? in . the . Mandean sources, where a \"divine being called Radiance or ziwa leads the sou1 over the haJiqia mia to the world of light.\"46 In other passages of the Mandean literature, reference is made to a substance called the avar ziwa (\"air of radiance\") which forms a kind of subtle atmosphere surrounding the world, and which is also sometimes personified as a J divine being. E. S. DROWER explains: Ayar-Ziwa. 'Ether-Brilliance' or \"radiant ether' .... this rare and purer atmosphere is represented as interpenetrating the thick air round the earth, and givingit vital 46 Hananael b.

See pp. 46-50 above."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"94 CHAPTER FOUR qualities .... This Ether is personified, and is sometimes mentioned as a source of life.n7 In the Mandean sources, radiance and light are connected not only with air, but also with water. DROWER comments: Water, which reflects the light, is considered a form of light .... A freshly baptized person is 'clothed in light'. The conception that the firmament is filled with a fluid light and that water is a grosser form of it appears in the doctrine of the planetary boats.48 DEUTSCH believes the water vision episode to be a veiled or coded pol- emic against these Mandean beliefs: The Mandaean terms for alr (ajar) and radtance (zrwa) parallel the expresstons a~n~rzrw and uw awir whlch appear In the Hekhalot verslons of the \"Water Warn- ~ng.\" Indeed, both Hekhalot and Mandaean sources agree that connected wtth the cosmlc waters (or lIIuslon ofwaters) 1s some klnd ofllght or rad~ance and alr. Once again, however, there 1s a cruc~al d~fference between the Jewlsh and Mandaean tradttlons. The Mandaeans personify the radlance and alr, even trans- forming them Into belngs who help the soul over the waters. They also poslt that the light actually becomes man~fest In the form of water. By contrast, the Helchalot authors connect the radlance and alr to the stones whlch only appear lilte water. The Helthalot texts therefore provide an dlternate expla~iatron for the appearance of the radiance and alr (they are not dlvlne belngs) just as they suggest an alternate explanation for the appearance of the water. In both cases, the source of the ~llusron IS actually the stones of the palace or hekhal. 7'hls etiology prlorltlzes the hekhalot over other cosmological structures whlch may appear 111 competing tradlttons such as Mandaelsm. As In the case of the waters, rather than deny~ng that rad~ance and alr appear at the end of the heavenly journey, the Hekhalot authors offer thelr own definitive verslon of the tradition, thereby subtly undermlnlng other cosmolog~cal traditions wtthout explic~tly rejecting them by DEUTSCH must certainly be right to suggest that the Mandean ayar-ziwa is related in some manner to the 7YK ~?T/>T 7'1X of the water vision episode in HZ. As observed above, however, his theory that the water 47 DROVER, 71/e Mandaeans ofIraq and Iran: nerr Cu4 Customs, Mags Legen& and Folklore (Letden: Brt11, 1962) 58, n. 13 (also quoted by DEUTSCH, Guardrans, 119). 48 DROVER, 71/e Mandaeans, 100 (also quoted by DEUTSCH, Guardrans, 120). 49 DEUTSCH, Guardrans, 120. THE CELESTIAL PAVEMENT AND THE \"ASCENT MIDRASH\" IN HZ 95 vision episode is basically a piece of anti-Mandean propaganda is less than wholly convincing and leaves several questions unanswered:' Moreover, the association between \"radiance\" and water in Mandeism is not really relevant to the context of the water vision episode, since it occurs primarily in connection with the life-giving waters of the celestial riveryardna and with purificatory baptismal rites.\" It does not, to my knowledge, feature in accounts of the soul's transition 3cic.-i; the haJiqia mia at the end of its heavenly journey after death. There, the ziwu is clearly opposed to the waters or huJCqia mia, which are associated more with darkness than with light.\" DEUTSCH seems here to have conflat- ed two motifs in Mandean tradition which are really quite disparate. As has already been remarked, moreover, many elements of Mandean belief and practice are either of Jewish origin or derived from a cultural matrix which was common to both religions, whereas there is no clear .evidence of Mandean influence on Jewish belief or practice:3 DROWER sees a correspondence between the Mandp-n a:i.zr-ziwa as the source of life and Josephus' report (War ii.154) tl:,, ,>c,iciing to the doctrine of ! the Essenes, human souls \"emanate from the most subtle ether\" ($K 700 i 1 h~nzozoizou $otzci)oac; aiQ~poq).~~ If this is correct, it implies i -- - 50 See pp. 48-50 above See DROWER, ne Mandaeans, 100-123; anA PIJDOLPH, Gnosa, 360-362. 52 See RUDOLPH, Gnosrs, 357-360 53 An excellent example IS, as ~t happens, provlded by Marldean bellef about water, only one part tn nlne of whlch is constdered to be mra hra or \"living water\" (= Heb r~-n DQ), comlng from and return~ng to the heavenly rlveryardna (from Heb 77!1), whereas the other ninr parts are d I~feless substance called tahma (= Web. 013n [?I) whlch ends up In the bltter waters of the sea (see DROWER, The Mandeans, 101-102) The orlglns of thls belief are clearly related to Jew~sh teachings that only \"l~ving\" water 1s effectlve for purrficatlon, and to the practjce - described In rabbinic sources but shown by archeological evidence to be eariler - of causlng a i?li)n COI>L~II~II~~ drawn water to be valld by mixlng Into ~t a much smaller amount of \"liviiig\" water (see m Mtqvaor 6 8 and further, for example, E.

We must, therefore, conclude etther that the Mandean beliefs about water are derlved from Judatsm, or that both reltg~ons drew thelr bel~efs and practices from a common source. 54 See DROWER, 726 Mandeans, 58, n. 13.

Whatever the truth of this matter, many technical terms in the Mandean religious literature are quite clearly of Hebrew origin.55 It is, therefore, much more prob able that the Mandean expression ayar-zzwa is derived from a Jewish source tradition than that the 171K 7'T/771 1'1K of the water vision episode in HZ has been imported from Mandeism. If, conlra HALPERIN, 1'7 3'1KD is accepted as the correct reading in HZ:D1 (as in the translation on page 56 above), the meaning is apparently that the substance of the \"pure marble stones,\" although it looks like turbulent water, is in fact \"brilliallt air.\" It thus seems that the visionary is looking down through the floor of the palace, which is evidently transparent, into the air of the world below. From the perspective of the ethereal realm in which he is standing, this air looks as dense and substantial as water. At the same time, the floor of the palace is the firmament dividing this celestial level from the one beneath it and, since the inhabitants of this realm are able to walk upon it, it is for them something solid, like stone. Thus, \"the pure marble stones with which the palace was paved (mi.rio)\" could also be said to be \"high\" or \"light\" (111'715~) and \"transparent\" (nl?lL7~), and are not water but solid air. The visionary traveller is literally \"walking on air.\" 4. 7Ee Celestial Pavement in Midrashic and Biblical Tradition In rabbinic midrash, the image of walking on the firmament occurs in the context of Moses' heavenly ascent at Sinai to obtain the Torah. The theme of angelic opposition to the admission into the heavenly realm of a human being is also encountered in these sources, although the ascending hero's response to this challenge is noticeably different from that of the hekhalot visionary:56 Heinemann, Putnam and Harvard Unlverslty Press, 1926-65) 2.382. is Of many posslble examples: hafirjra mta, yardna, mta bra, and fahma (see pp. 46- 47 and n. 53 above). 56 Pes.

Although the literary relationships between the various recensions of this material in the midrashic literature and the hekhalot writings are neither clear nor straightforward, there can be no doubt that both draw from a common matrix of ancient tradition.69 As we have observed, the ascent of Moses is a central theme of the HZ collection. in the passage quoted above, the angel's accusation of Moses expresses a common theme of angelic opposition to the ascent of human beings into heaven, on the grounds that the process of conception and birth renders one born of woman substantially and inherently impure. The biblical roots of the image of the transparent firmament as the floor of the celestial world can be traced to Ezek. 1:2t .lad 1:26, interpreted in the light of Exod. 24:10: Ezek. 1:22 Ezk. 1:26 Exod 24:lO And over the heads of And from above the And they saw the God of the llvlng creatures was firmament whlch was Israel and, under his feet, an image like the appear- over then heads, 11lte the someth~ng l~ke tilework ance of the terrible Ice appearance of sapphire of sapphire, and 11ke the (or: crystal), stretched out stone, was the Image of a substance of heaven for over thelr heads, from throne and, on the lmage purlty. above of the throne, was an image like the appearance of a man, upon it from above. 69 See: GR~ZINGER, Ich bin der Hen, esp. 142-149 and %43-248; HALPERIN, Faces, 289-322.

THE CELESTIAL PAVEMENT AND THE \"ASCENT MIDRASH\" IN HZ 99 As observed by ZIMMERLI, the term Y'i77, \"firmament,\" is derived from i a verb meaning \"to stamp,\" or \"beat According to traditional Hebrew cosmology, the Y'p! was, of course, the solid barrier with which God divided the \"upper\" waters from the \"lower\" waters (Gen. 1:6-7).~' In Ezek. 1:26, however, the firmament is the floor of the divine throne room. It thus corresponds to the sapphire pavement of Exod. 24:10, which is said to be made of \"the substance of heaven.\" The word 773, \"purity,\" applied to this substance, should be noted. The term n?i7, applied to the appearance of the substance out of which this firmament is made (Ezek. 1:22), refers elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible to ice or frost, but LXX translates: ~puozdhhou. Most translators and commentators have chosen to apply the words 179Q-12K ?Kin3 in MT Ezek. 1:26 to the throne,\" but the clear parallel with ft!lliJ n2p;r in Ezek. 1:22 I seems to indicate that they really refer to the firmament. If this is correct, Ezek. 1:26 itself embodies an exegesis of Exod. 24:10.73 This was probably understood by the translator of LXX, who rendered Ezek. 1:25-26 as follows:74 I ~ai t600 $wvq bnspcIvo0av TOO crzspa6 pazo~ zo6 bvzo~ 0n8p ~s$ahq 5 a0~Gv Bpacrtq hl0ov cran$alpov, dpolopa 0p6vov 6.n' a0700 ...

It appears that the hekhalot writer, perhaps taking his cue from the strangely redundant word ;i>~)ain (literally: \"from above\") (Ezek. 1:22, 1:26), and perhaps also believing that ~'j7!> i~)3ni (\"and from above the firmament\") (Ezek. 1:26) expresses the prophet-narrator's point of view, has interpreted the scriptural description of Ezekiel's vision as an account of a heavenly ascent. 5. i?e Ascent Midrash Although most commentators believe that narrative descriptions of heav- enly ascents represent an exclusively post-biblical de~eloprnent,~~ this 75 Thus, for example, ZIMMERLI, Ezekiell, 87 The word is marked as an addltlon to the text in BI-iS (3rd. ed.; 1987) and omitted by RSV. 76 GRELNBERG, Ezekiel 1-20, 48. 77 BROWNLEE, Eztktel 1-19, 13 (see also rbrd., 9, n. 22a). 78 See p. 56, n. 14 above. 79 See, for example: MAIER, Vom Kultus, 14-15 and 106-128; GRUENWALD, 'Know- ledge and Vision: Towards a Clarification of two \"Gnostic\" Concepts in the L~ght of their Alleged Ongins,' IOS 3 (1973), reprinted in idem, Fmm Aporabpfic fo Gnostrnsm (BEATAJ 14; Frankfurt am Ma~n, etc.: Peter Lang, 1988) 69-70 and 98-115; rdem, Apocaiyptlc, 32; rdem, \"Priests, Prophets, Apocalyptic Vlslonaries, and Mystics,\" In idem, THE CELESTIAL PAVEMENT AND THE \"ASCENT MIDRASH\" IN HZ 101 interpretation of Ezekiel's vision is, arguably, well supported by the text. Having fallen on his face (Ezek. 1:28), the prophet gets up and interacts with the figure on the throne, eating the scroll that he offers him, and so forth (Ezek. 2:9-3:3). All this makes excellent sense if we understand the prophet to be in the presence of the l~;lr'7i13, i.e., in his vision, above the firmament!' Whatever the meaning intended by the biblical author may have been, the interpretation that I have attributed to the hekhalot writer is thus a viable and reasonable reading of the scriptural account.*' If, as appears to be the case, he understands Ezek. 1:26 to mean that the prophet is standing upon the firmament and looking down, he has presumably inferred that, when the 37'13~ and the ~'93iK \"ascended from the earth\" (Ezek. 1:21), the prophet ascended with them. This inference was doubtless confirmed by Ezek. 3:12-14, where a wind or spirit lifts the prophet up ('1n2nl '1p8i2)l n711 .... n'ri s?fipn!) and, apparently, returns him to earth. This experience is accompanied by \"the sound of the wings of the ni\" touching one another, and the sound of the D'Jg'ifi beside them, like the sound of a great earthquake\" (Ezek. 3:13, compare 1:24). According to the hekhalot writer's interpret- ation, the wind that returns the prophet to earth in Ezek. 3:l-12 must be the ;l:fllg Dn of Ezek. 1:2@21, conventionally translated: \"spirit of the living creatures\" but here, perhaps, interpreted as the wind generated by their wings, which had previously carried him up to the realm above the firmament. This exegesis of Ezekiel's vision is further developed in the passage that follows the water vision episode, where the visionary is raised from the sixth to the seventh i3'7 by the living creatures and by \"a wind of living brilliance\" (;iT i? nil, HZG3).

The vocabulary of the passage is full of allusions to Ezekiel 1-3 and it is especially noteworthy that the state- ment that the cherubim \"kiss\" the adept (1nlK 17~tVt.'3n) contains a verbal echo of the \"touching\" (mptuQ) of the wings of the n7V in Ezek. 3:13. It appears, then, that the literary sequence which provides the context of the water vision episode, as preserved in HZ, is, at least in part, an exegetical exposition of Ezekiel's vision, and specifically of Ezek. 1:19-28 (from the rising of the wheels and the living creatures, at the instigation of the 73ng Dll, to the vision of >DUD lY7) and, second- arily, of Ezek. 3:12-14. This observation provides a key to the narrative structure of the sequence as a whole, which appears to have been constr- ucted as a mystical midrash or chain of midrashim on the first words of Ezek. 1:27: ~DW? 1Y3 KlKJ. In this midrashic composition, the bib lical verse (section A, the lemma) is interpreted in the context of an ascent to, or entry into, the outer and innermost sanctuaries of the cel- estial temple, which are the sixth and seventh mh77 of this system. Section B, the first of three separate midrashic expositions, explains that \"the one who looks like ~nwn\" is the guardian of the entrance to the sixth i3m, whose function is to distinguish between those who are worthy and those who are unworthy. Section C is a secondary expans- ion of section B, developing the theme of selection amongst the 7-111~ 723ln. This episode is not directly connected to the scriptural lemma and does not appear to be derived by exegesis from Ezekiel 1. It has, therefore, almost certainly been imported from another source.83 HAL- PERIN'S suggestion that the episode is derived from a convention of reti- cence on the part of one called to officiate during synagogue worship may well have merit.84 Section D, the water vision episode, is the second midrash and refers directly to the lemma without reference to B-C. Here, the appear- ance of 5ntVn is explained, not as the description of an angelic temple guardian, but rather as a reference to the substance of Ezekiel's shining firmament of solid and transparent air, which is identified with the 83 See further DAN, \"~tUytU 53'n nnf3,\" 197-199. 84 See p. 66 above.

While the composition of this material may, perhaps, be subsequent to that of section D, it develops the narrative in a coherent manner and so appears to be deriv- ed directly from the midrash. It is therefore unlikely to have been imported into this midrashic sequence from an outside source. Aqiba's words in babli, All-19 appear to be derived from this stage of develop- ment of the HZ literary traditi~n.~' Section G describes the triumphant finale of the ascent, in which the i723ln 7117 is admitted to the divine throne room or seventh 5377. This section refers back to the lemma and introduces a third midrashic exposition, explaining that the appearance of ~nwn seen by the prophet Ezekiel, and by the worthy m3in mi7, is the light of the countenance of Jacoba7 This vision is, however, obscured by a covering of dark clouds,88 which are said to \"sprinkle blood\" (HZ:Glb).

Some Jewish and Christian Apocaiyptlc Sources The previous chapter has shown that the narrative sequence which incl- I udes the water vision episode In HZ is organized around a series of mystlcal midrashim attached to Ezek. 1:27a: ?~vn 1373 tilti!, in which the text of Ezekiel 1 is interpreted as an account of an ascent to the divine throne room in the sanctuary of the celestial temple. The glitter- I ing floor of this sanctuary, which resembles water, but which is really made of solidified transparent alr, is Ezekiel's firmament (and also that of Exod. 24:lO) viewed from above. This exegetical tradition is evident- ly quite closely related to the mrdrashrc accounts of Moses' ascent to the I pure realm of celestial fire above the firmament, to which HZ itself makes reference. These findings have advanced our understanding of this material, but the full significance of the error of mistaking the \"brilllant air\" of the firmament for water remains elusive. The tradi- tional opposition between the temple and the chaos waters is surely rel- I evant, but provides only a partial explanation of this episode. TO gain I a deeper understanding of its meaning, we must enquire into the origins and background of the belief that Ezekiel 1 should be understood as an account of a heavenly ascent, this belng the central premise on which I the \"ascent midrash\" in HZ is based. The beginnings of this exegetical development can be clearly detect- ed as early as the pre-Maccabean period. In I Enoch 14, Enoch's ascent to the celestial sanctuary is described as follows:' I ' 1 Enoch 14:8-17 (compare p. 37 above). Greek text In M.

Nonetheless, several points of especial relevance to this study may be noted. In the first place, Ezekiel's vision is already interpreted as a journey into (ai~fiA8ov) the consecutive pre- cincts of the heavenly temple, which are later represented by the seven n~h, but appear in this passage to be only three in number. As we have seen, the three stages of Enoch's journey correspond to the 2110 (or the wall around the inner temple precinct), the outer sanctuary and the holy of holies, representing the three celestial levels of TZe Book of the Watchen.13 Like Ezekiel as interpreted by the hekhalot author, and like the i?l21%1 711' in the ascent midrash (HZ:G3), Enoch is raised to heaven by the wind (I Enoch 14%-9).14 Most importantly, the floor of snow, ice or crystal at I Enoch 14:SO is clearly the firmament of Ezek. 1:22-26, seen from above, and the \"smooth ashlars\" (kle6nha~cq) of I Enoch 14:11 are surely the literary ancestors of the \"marble stones\" of the water vision episode.15 The crystalline substance of the throne resembles that of the firmament and reflects the interconnected imagery of Ezek. 1:22, 1:26 and Exod. 24:10, as discussed above.I6 The refer- ences to fear in 1 Enoch 14:9 and 13-14 may, perhaps, reflect the express- ion XTlI in Ezek. 1:22. The obscure reference to the cherubim and their \"heaven of water\" (1 Enoch 14:Sl) seems somehow relevant to this study, but it is difficult to determine exactly what this means. In the first place, it is not entire- ly clear whether the cherubim are located \"betxeen\" the celestial phen- omena on the ceiling (thus most translators) or, as seems more prob- able, \"between\" the walls, floor and ceiling. Similarly, it is not certain whether the preposition aCz&v, applied to oCpav65 (\"their heaven\"), refers to the cherubim, or to the celestial phenomena on the ceiling, or \"See further, for example: GRUENWALD, Apocalyptrc, 32-37; NICKELSBURG, \"Enoch, Levl, and Peter,\" 576-587; ROWLAND, 7be Open Hraven,219-221; HALPERIN, Faces, 78-85; HIMMELTARB, Ascent to Heaven, 14-16. \" See p. 30 above. l4 Compare 1 Enoch 70:2, where Enoch ascends to heaven on \"a charlot of wind,\" a motlf which IS also found in a citation of an Enoch apocalypse in the Cologne Man2 Codex; see further JOHN C.

Whatever the pre- cise meaning of the syntax, the o6pavb~ should probably be identified with Ezekiel's firmament, upheld by the cherubim (= nl'n). If so, how- ever, it is no longer the floor of the outer house, seen from above as in verse 10, but its ceiling, seen from below. It is perhaps possible that the author of 1 Enoch 14 has interpreted the repeated expression LOJ2j;i (\"when they went\") at Ezek. 1:21 and 24 as indicating two distinct stages of the heavenly ascent, and Ezek. 122 and 26 as referring to two succ- essive firmaments. At 1 Enoch 14:17, the expression avhz~pov aCzoO (\"above it\"), which has puzzled translator^,'^ seems to reflect the i?)y~h of Ezek. 1:22 and 26. The description of the floor of the inner house (1 Enoch 14:17) is so similar to that of the ceiling of the outer house (14:ll) as to suggest that it is the same phenomenon, now seen from above. It thus appears that underlying this passage is the image of the starry firmament as the throne-platform upheld by the cherubim, which looks like water, Ice or crystal, but which also, when seen from above, resembl- es fire. According to the author of the water vision episode in HZ, as we have seen, the substance of this celestial pavement, the h~n, is \"brilliant air\" (171K 1't/l7T TlK), the \"terrible\" or \"transparent\" (K713) brilliance of which looks like the shimmering of water. Several sources describe the visionary as standing on the celestial firmament and looking down through it at the worlds below. An extra- rabbinic witness to the currency of these ideas in the late first or early second century CE is the ascent narrative in Apocztlypse ofAbraham 15- 29,18 where the ascent to the seventh heaven is described as follow^:'^ And we ascended as if (carried) by many winds to the heaven that is fixed on the vast expanses. And I saw on the air to whose height we had ascended a strong light which can not be described. l7 See p 107, n. 9 above. On the date and provenance of The Apocalypse ofAbraham, see, for example: G.

LUNT states in a note appended to this passage that the Slavonic phrase na aere' \"presents the air as a s~rface.\"~' The indescribably strong light of this surface is strikingly similar to the \"brilliant air\" of the water vision episode in HZ and may likewise be derived from Ezek- iel's >DY~ I!+??. A little later, we are told that this firmament undulates up and down (17:3) in a manner which appears to resemble the motion of waves. This is followed by a 7231B vision, replete with allusions to EZC:?..!:~ 1, after which Abraham looks down through the firmament at tile levels below - very much like Moses in Pes. R. 20 - and is shown the past arid future history of creation, depicted on the firmament upon which he is standing (21:1..29:21).21 The Ascension of Isaiah, a Christian ascent-apocalypse of about the same period as Apocalypse ojAbrabarn and deeply indebted to Jewish sources, also describes an ascent through seven heavens.22 As Isaiah ascends through the first five heavens, the transition from one heaven to the next is described with the simple formula: \"and (again) he took me up into the nth heaven\" (Asc. Isa. 7:13-37), but at the point of entry to the sixth heaven this formula becomes: And again, he took me up ~nto the arr oJthe slxth heaven, and I saw a splendor such as I had not seen In the five heavens as I went up!' This formula, which again calls to mind the \"brilliant air\" of the water vision episode, is repeated at the point of transition from the sixth to the seventh heaven. Here, Isaiah's worthiness to enter is challenged by \"the one in charge of the praise of the sixth heaven\" (Asc. Isa. 9:I-4), who occupies a role similar to that of the \"one like ~wR\" in the ascent midrash (HVHR: A-B). The dominant characteristic of the two highest heavens is their extraordinary brightness, which is so great that \"I thought that light which I had seen in the lower five heavens darkness\" (Asc Isa. 8:21).24 Brightness is, of course, the primary characteristic of Ezekiel's ~wR. 20 Ibld., n. 15d.

THE CELESTIAL PAVEMENT AND THE WATERS OF IMPURITY 11 1 A reference to water in heaven occurs in the vision described in the second and third chapters of Testament of Levi, the Aramaic source of which can be dated from fragments discovered at Qumran to the later part of the second century BCE.*' It is therefore one of the earliest surviving Jewish ascent texts, but, since no portion of the description of Levi's heavenly ascent has survived in Aramaic, we cannot be certain that all of this material belongs to the earliest level of the text's develop- ment.26 The specific terminology to be considered below may, there- fore, have originated as late as the first or second century CE. In chapter 2, we read: '\"~nd behold, the hedvens were opened, and an angel of the Lord spoke to me: 'Levl, Lev], enter!' (\"And I entered the first heaven, and saw there much water suspended (Kcti ~ioijh0ov ~bv npol~ov obpavdv ~ai ~iSov ~KEE 6S0p nohO ~pepcipvov)!~ And aga~n I saw a secondz8 heaven much br~ghter and more lustrous, for there was a measureless he~ght In ~t.

This level is above that of the waters, which dre \"suspended\" (KPE~&~EVOV) in the first heaven (2:7). These hanging waters are clearly the \"upper waters\" above the earthly firmament of Gen. 1:7?~ The celestial sanct- uary is, therefore, above these waters and, presumably, separated from them by a second firmament. The statement that this level is \"brighter and more lustrous\" than the waters beneath it (29) calls to mind the 11713 U7U '31K of the water vlsion episode, \"the brilliance of whlch was more terrible than water\" (HZ:D1), while the expression KPE~&~EVOV resembles one meaning of the passive participle nlil'7~ (\"high,\" \"light,\" or \"swinging\").34 The darkness of the lowest heaven is said to be due to contamination by contact with the sins of human beings on earth (3:1), and also to the fact that it is inhabited by the instruments of divine wrath, including (possibly demonic) spirits who are sent to inflict punishment on human beings (3:2).

THE CELESTIAL PAVEMENT AND THE WATERS OF IMPURITY 113 I unlike the fearsome guardians of the sixth h~. The invitation to Levi to \"enter\" the sanctuary (2:6) is reminiscent of the incident at the sixth gate in the ascent midrash (H&!HR:Cl-2) and, indeed, the 0713 story. It must be stipulated that no single one of these points, considered individually, is strong enough to establish a direct connection between Test. Lev. 2:6-3:5 and the water vision episode in HZ. The linguistic echoes noted above are, however, sufficient in number to support the strong suspicion that both texts are derived from a common matrix of symbolic and literary tradition. Of great importance is the fact that Testament of Levz locates the celestial sanctuary above the \"upper waters\" and provides compelling evidence that this notion was current in the second century CE at latest, and perhaps much earller. We should also observe that a parallel between the priesthood of Levi (210) and that of the archangels (35) is evidently intended. An interesting juxtaposition of air with water in heaven is found in 2 Enoch, recension J, 3:l-3: I And it came about, when I had spoken to my sons, those men called me. And they toolc me up onto their wings, and carried me up to the first heaven, and placed me on the clouds. And behold, they were moving. And there I perceived the air higher up, and higher still I saw the ether. And they placed me on the first heaven. And they showed me a vast ocean, much bigger than the earthly ocean.35 Although this passage is not entirely clear, it seems to contain several elements which are reminiscent of the ascent midrash in HZ. Enoch I ascends - first on the angels' wings, then on the clouds - through the air, then the ether, until he is standing on the first heaven. Here, he encounters a \"vast ocean,\" which may perhaps be the surface of the air and/or ether through which he has just passed. Admittedly, the locat- ion of the ocean in the first, rather than sixth, heaven means that the parallel with the ascent midrash in HZ is far from but it is readily aparent that this passage shares a common background with the texts discussed above.37 Although the date and provenance of 2 Enoch 35 Trans. F. I. ANDERSEN, OTP, 11.10. 36 The longer (J) recension of 2 Enoch has ten heavens, but the original text has almost certainly been expanded. The shorter (A) recension has seven heavens only.

The roots of this idea have been traced to a midrashic exposition of Ezek. 1:19-28, interpreted as a description of a heavenly ascent from below to above the firmament supported by the nian. In this midrash, Ezek. 1:27a, >~yja ]Y? RlV! is understood to be an allusion to the brilliance of this celestial pavement (cf. Exod. 24:10, \"like the substance of heav- en\") when seen from above (~7j73) ?YdQ Ezek. 1:26; ;1)7~>Q, Ezek. 1:22, 1:26), and the agency which causes the prophet to ascend is identified as the ir!n;ll D?il of Ezek. 1:2@21. The beginnings of this exegetical trad- ition can be traced as far back as the early second-century BCE Book of the Wztchers, where, already, the heavenly ascent is interpreted as a jour- ney through the successive courts of a temple, the \"floors\" and \"ceil- ings\" of which correspond to a plurality of firmaments resembling fire, ice, snow, or water. Detailed correspondences with the imagery and language of the water vision episode have been encountered in a cluster of sources from the late first and early second centuries CE. Apoc. Abr. 15:s speaks of a firmament of soiid air, while Test. Lev. 2:6-3:15 appears to locate the celestial temple and its inner sanctuary (heavens two and three) above the upper waters. In Kt, Ad 29:1-3, the image of walking on solid water is associated with the heavenly 0713. Some significant details of the water vision episode are, however, as yet unexplained and it is not yet clear why the mistake of believing the air of the firmament 52 See pp. 84-86 above. 53 See p. 83 above. 54 GRUENWALD, Apo~~lyptic, 142.

A key to this problem is contained in the form of the question asked by the unworthy i723in -Ill5: \"These waters - what is the nature of them (72~ Outside the context of the water vision episode, there are six occurrences in the hekhalot manuscripts published by SCHAFER of the interrogative formula: -2'u ;In with suffix.i6 In 3 Enoch, 5:SS-12, the angels persuade God to withdraw his 71'3W from the earth after the idolatry of the generation of Enosh, by urging him as follows: \"Why have you abandoned the heaven of heavens on high, the abode of your Glory, and the high and exalted throne which is in the height of nllly, and come and lodged with the sons of men who worship idols, and who have placed you on the same level as the idols ('T'Y1 1nlK IlVifl)? Now you are in the earth, and the idols are in the earth. What business have you (P't3 ?In) among the idolatrous generations of earth?\"i7 Here, the formula is rhetorical and expresses the angels' disapproval of association between the divine Presence and human beings. In the rem- aining five instances, the formula is applied to a human being, but the contrast between the natures of human and heavenly beings is essential- ly the same. The following three cases resemble the water vision episode in that they concern the ascent of a human being to heaven. In 3 Enoch 2:2, the angels express their objection to R. Ishmael's presence in heaven by asking Metatron: \"Youth, why have you permitted one born of woman to come and behold the if23713 ....

R. 20.11-12;' where the fiery nature of the heavenly world is also emphasized. The words: \"men Moses arr- ived (YTI) at the place of the sapphire stone\" are formally reminiscent of Aqiba's warning in babli and must allude to the crystal firmament of Exod. 24:10, on which Moses presumably is standing. Two instances of the formula -1'23 ;In remain to be considered. These occur in connection with the descent of heavenly beings to earth, not the ascent of a human being to heaven. In the cosmological treatise Seder Rabbah diBereihit, it is applied to one who presumes to exercise the priestly prerogative of pronouncing the divine name: For whenever a man Interprets the letters of the name of the Holy One, blessed be he, those letters of fire that stand In front of the crown of the Holy One, blessed be he, fly forth, hour by hour, moment by moment, Instant by instant!

He must not taste any filthy thing, and he must not look at a woman, and he must sit in a dark house.64 It has become apparent that in the hekhalot manuscripts, the formula -lSU ;in occurs primarily in the context of interaction between angels and humans, and is used as a rhetorical device which emphasizes the contrasting natures of the human and heavenly worlds.65 In one case, this is linked to the sin of idolatry, and in another to descent from \"those who perished in the fl~od,\"~ but the aspect of human nature that is most clearly and consistently contrasted with the pure nature of the heavenly world, in both the hekhalot sources and the Sinai midrash- im, is the impurity which is inherent in the status: \"born of woman.\" The \"putrid\" fluids and impure processes of conception, of which the 64 SCHAFER, Synopse, 993 13-3 14. 65 Two instances of the formula in a different context, and with a different mean- ing, are listed in SCHAFER'S Konkordanz (see p. 119, n. 56 above), but neither occurs in any of the mss. included in idem, Synopse. The first is found at the beginning of the iI331D midrash Visions oJEzckie1 (i.A in trans. HALPERIN, Faces, 264; cf. ed. WERT- HEIMER, Jl)W77M )n2, 2.127): 'And if came to pars in the fhirfiefh bear], and so forth [Ezeltiel 1:1]. What was the nature of these (pt3 iln). Tbirly corresponds to thirty kings who reigned over Israel. For thus they said to Ezekiel: \"Our fathers were punished in the desert forty years, ayear/or tach day [that they spied out the land of Canaan; Numbers 14:34]. Similarly, we are punished for every king who arose over us.\"' The second occurs in itlass. Hek., 924,l (ed. HERRMANN, 72\" [Hebrew] and 176 [German]), where the author introduces his discussion of the heavenly voices that accompany the wheels of the i1221n with the question: 1'?'7i1 nlhp nn2 ?to pa nn. Neither of these two cases occurs in the context of interaction between humans and angels. They do not, therefore, substantially affect my argument. 66 This is rather strange, since those who died in the flood have for that reason no descendants. Possibly the parents of Noah's wife and those of his son's wives are intended. If so, the contamination of future generations is transmitted on the female side. THE CELESTIAL PAVEMENT AND THE WATERS OF IMPURIn 123 corruptible human body is the product, and which are attributed prim- arily to the female, are held to be wholly incompatible with the pure, fiery substance of the heavenly world and the angels' bodies. As GOLD BERG has pointed out:' the hekhalot sources and the Sinai midrashim repeatedly emphasize the point that the basic substance of the heavenly world is fire (or its celestial equivalent, inwn), which is destructive to corruptible human bodies, unless those bodies are themselves transform- ed into fire during the course of the asce~lt.~~ Thus, again, Pes. R. 20.12: \"What are you doing (1'7 ;m) amidst the holy ones of the Most High? You have come from the place of wombfilthiness - what are you doing (15 ;In) in the place of purity? You are born of a woman -what are you doing (15 Tin) in the place of fireY6' It is, I think, clear that the expression 12'P 7n in the context of the water vision episode is the equivalent of 15 Tth in Pes. R. 20, and that it expresses a similar contrast between the pure substance of heaven and impure earthly matter. The question llw nn 75~8 o'nn implies, then, that the image of water is associated with the inherent impurity of human conception, birth and bodily existence. In this symbolic ledger, fire is on the side of purity and the angels, while water stands for the substantial basis of corruptible matter, which is alien to the pure, celest- ial dwelling place of God. 4. TEe Palace Above the Waters A similar symbolic model is encountered at y.Hag. 77c: A. R. Judan Nesiya asked R. Samuel bar Nabman: What is the reason for the text, Praise fhe Chariofeer in nl2'Jy by his natne, Yah (inw 73) and rioice b&re Him (Ps. 68:4)? B. He said to him: There is no place anywhere that does not have a governor appointed over its highways. And who is the governor of the highways of them 67 See pp 37-38 above. See MORRAY-JONES, “Transformational Mystlclsrn,\" 11-14, 17-18,22-26, and the references clted there. \" See p. 97 above."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"124 CHAPTER FIVE all? The Holy One, blessed be he. \"Highway\" is his name (reading 333 [= Latin via] instead of ?I:?), for Yah is his name. C. He said to him: R. Leazar, your master, used not to expound it thus but (compared it) to a king who built a palace (77~59) in a place of sewers, in a place of midden heaps, in a refuse dump. Does not one insult him, who comes along and says, \"This palace is in a place of sewers! It is in a place of midden heaps! It is in a refuse dump!\"? Just so does one insult him who says, \"In the beginning the world was water mixed with water (D7D1 D'D).\"~' Judan Nesiya's question (A) refers to the praise of God on his ;7231%1 in nl2lY, the highest heaven (in the hekhalot writings, very often called Y771 m21Y). Samuel's answer (B) is an extremely far fetched pun, and serves only as a foil to Leazar's exposition (C), which explains that to associate water with the realm of the ;i231n is a sacreligious insult, i.e., the opposite of praise. The king's palace is the preexistent celestial temple, whereas water appears to be associated with the material world of corruption and impurity. Applying this symbolism to the water vision episode, the pavement of the celestial sanctuary is the solid but transparent firmament of \"brilliant air,\" which functions as a barrier between the two realms of existence and prevents them from coming into contact. One who, see- ing this firmament from above, misperceives it as being water and asks: \"j2'U ;in'' thereby attributes impurity to the sanctuary and reveals his own state of impurity and unworthiness. This is why the angelic guard- ians, whose function is to safeguard the purity of the temple, react to the question with such violence and why, in HZF, the merest mention of water is enough to betray the unworthy iT131D 711' as \"worthless\" and a blasphemer. The angels' words: \"Do you not see with your eyes?\" (HZ:D2) seem to indicate that the \"brilliant air\" of the firmament does 70 The above text is immediately followed byyerushalmis verslon of the parable of the klng's garden, (B3-8 on p. 8 above): \".... to the garden of a king wlth an upper chamber bullt above it. One may look, but not approach.\" As we have seen, a vari- ant form th~s parable 1s 1s appended to the Dl19 story In tosfla (Bl-9). Inyerushalml, there is no continuity between the parable and section C of the text given above, and several translators (e.g , NEUSNER, HagrgahandMoedQatan, 53) have found it necessary to make the connection by supplying additional words. As was argued on pp. 21-23 above, however, the parable seems to be ~nherentiy connected to the Dl13 story and 1s therefore misplaced here. THE CELESTIAL PAVEMENT AND THE WATERS OF IMPURITY 125 not look like water to them, and that the misperception is something of which only a corruptible human body is susceptible. This may expl- ain why one who is deceived by the illusion is \"unworthy to see the king in his beauty.\" It may also be why, in the D71D story according to HZ(N), B2a-b we are told that Ben Azzai \"saw the brilliance of the air of the marble stones .... and his body could not bear it, and he open- ed his mouth ...,\" whereas Ben Zoma was physically strong enough to resist the urge to ask the question, although his mind was still over- whelmed by the illusion. Returning to Leazar's parable of the king's palace, it is interesting to discover an allusion to the cosmological doctrine which lies behind the symbolism of the water vision episode in yerushalmi, which nowhere alludes to the episode itself. The expression n9n1 D9n refers to the division between the upper and lower waters (Gen. 1:6-8) and Leazar's exegesis thus insists that the dwelling place of \"the Charioter in n72lY\" is above and beyond them both. The background of this tradition may be connected with an exegesis of Psalm 104:1-4, which, as HALPERIN points out, evidently influenced the author of I Enoch 14, and which crops up more than once in appar- ently esoteric midrashim on Gen. 1:l:\" (\"0 LORD my God, you are very great. You are clothed with glory and splendor. (\"Who covers hlmself with light as wlt1-1 a garment, Who spreads out the heavens llke a tent, (''Who sets the beams of hls upper chambers in the waters Who malces the clouds his charlot, Who walks on the wings of the wind, '4hX/ho makes his angels wlnds, His ministers flaming fire. HALPERIN not unreasonably renders the first line of verse 3 by: \"roofs his upper chambers in the water^,\"'^ but if ;ll$??;! is translated straight- forwardly, as above, the line may reasonably be understood to mean that the beams beneath the floor of the \"upper chambers\" of God's dwelling 71 See HALPERIN, Faus, 82-85. 72 HALPERIN, Faces, 83."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"126 CHAPTER FIVE are laid upon the waters.73 This is remarkably like the image found in Test. Lev. 2:6-3:5 andy.Hag. 77c (C) of the temple or palace whose upper chambers are above the watery realm of the impure material creation (i.e., above the \"upper waters\"). The first line of verse 4 is normally taken to mean \"makes the winds his messengers\" (thus RSV), but HALP- ERIN rightly suggests that later expositors may well have understood it in the manner suggested by the above tran~lation.~~ Taken together with the previous line, this accords with the way in which Ezekiel's Dl1 ?]n3 was understood by authors of descriptions of heavenly ascents from 1 Enoch 14 to the water vision episode in HZ. 5. 1The Waters of Impzlrily in the Qumran Sc~olls In the writings of the Dead Sea Sect, the image of turbulent or muddy water appears often to be symbolic of the inherent impurity of the mat- erial creation and, especially, the biological processes of the birth-giving female. The 1Thankcgving Hymns contain several allusions to this theme: ,.... I am a creature of clay, fashioned with water, nlnn 51ln1 inn7 1x7 11~1 foundation of shame, source of impurity ....75 i??~il ilpni mi~n 110 It is important to observe that clay and water are associated with the shameful condition of impurity, which originates in the female (831).

Closely associated with these destructive waters is the image of a woman, who seems to represent, at least in part, the material creation (cf. Rom. 8:18-23), and who is racked by agonizing birth pangs as she gives birth to a son (evidently, the soul of the hymnist), following which she is overwhelmed and destroyed by the forces of impurity and evil: Now, my soul [ .] -[ ]wol nnv they have counted me, and have put the soul W~I tn7v7? 7111~~n~ like a boat in the depths [of the sea], - - ni'7lr[n]3 (SIC) i~~11~2 llke a besieged city positioned opposite [its enemies].

The masculinity of the new-born coun- sellor separates him spiritually from his doomed and fundamentally evil mother, whom the writer regards with an intensity of disgust and loath- ing that, to a modern sensibility, appears pathological The remainder of the hymn tells how the wicked are sucked down by the \"torrents of Belial\" into the infernal abyss. The soul of the righteous man is, however, rescued from this destructive orgg by being raised up to a heavenly expanse on which, like the heroes of the apocalypses, the Moses of the Sinai midrashim, and the i123in 9?119, he is able, in his rescued state, to walk: I thdnk you, Lord, llllK il211K because you saved my life from the pit, nnvn 1vg1 ;in779 13 and from Sheol and Abaddon you have lifted me up 11n95yil jlil~ 5i~wni to an everlasting he~ght, n51y Dl15 so that I can walk on a boundless plain.80 ii)n l'~? i1v9nl il35iln~l 6. The Book of Revelatzon In the Book of Revelation, as in the Qumran literature, imagery of turb- ulent water and, especially, the sea is symbolically associated with the demonic forces of opposition to Cod's will. In chapter 12, we encount- er a scarlet beast \"with ten horns and seven heads .... and a blasphemous name upon its heads.\" This beast spews out a river of blasphemy and lies against a female figure \"clothed with the sun and with the moon under her feet\" (12:1), who represents the messianic community or earthly Zion and will later be transformed into the Bride of God, the New Jerusalem (21:1-22:5).81 In the following chapter, the same beast arises from the sea (13:1), to blaspheme God's name and dwelling, \"that is, those who dwell in heaven\" (13:6), to dominate the earth and to wage war against the saints or \"holy ones\" (no~ioni n6hepov psi& r&v diyiov) (13:7) In chapter 17 we are introduced to \"the great harlot who lQW, XI(= iii).19-20, trans.

And in the midst of the throne and around the throne (Kai 6v p6crq TOO Bp6vou K~S ~6rhg TOO 9p6vou; cf. Ezek. 1:27: J13Q 3?n7;l) are four living beings, full of eyes in front and behind. (7)And the first living being is like a lion, and the second living being is like a calf, and the third living being has a face like that of a man, and the fourth living being is like a flying eagle. (')And the four living beings, each one of them having six wings, are full of eyes around and within (KVK~~~EV at EooB~v; cf. Ezek. 1:4: ?>'mD? 279P). And they do not rest, day and night, from saying: Holy! Holy!

The crystal sea of Rev. 4:6 is undoubtedly the crystal firmament of Ezek. 1:22-26 (LXX).83 BEASLEY-MURRAY makes the important observation that this writer's treatment of the image of the crystal sea is unusual in one very significant respect: He does not actually state that there is a sea in heaven. He says that there 1s someth~ng which looks like one (as zt were ....), hav~ng the appearance of glass or crystal.a4 On this material, see especially: G. B.

THE CELESTIAL PAVEMENT AND THE WATERS OF IMPURITY 131 This striking correspondence with the central motif of the water vision episode, which has not been found in any other non-rabbinic source, is almost certainly derived from the language patterns of Ezekiel 1 itself. The @q . Opoia of Rev. 4:6a echoes the I'Y3 .... nlqi of Ezek. 1:22 and also, perhaps, the LfK*;I81?23 i~wn I'Y? of Ezek. 1:27. An indicat- ion that the author of Revelation, like the composer of the water vision episode, has understood the latter expression to be a description of the firmament may be detected in Rev. 15:2a, where the sea of glass is descr- ibed in a slightly different way: And I saw what appeared to be a glass sea, mingled with fire (~al ~lFov hq 86thaooav bahivqv p~p~ypivqv xupi) Around this crystal sea, which is remarkably similar in composition and appearance to the floors and ceilings of the temple in 1 Enoch 14;' stand \"those who have conquered the beast and its image\" (15:2b), who are said to sing \"the Song of Moses, the servant of God, and the Song of the Lamb\" (15:3). Only the words of the latter are given (\"Great and amazing are your deeds, 0 Lord God Almighty ... !\") and it is almost certainly safe to assume that by \"the Song of Moses\" is meant Exod. 15:l-18. It appears, then, that the author of the Book of Revelation believes that God's righteous ones, who have \"conquered the beast\" and \"come out\" from the harlot-city of the corrupt and impure world of the flesh in advance of the coming judgement (18:4), are now located in the heav- enly world, above Ezekiel's firmament. An uncompromising statement of the criteria by which these righteous persons have been selected is found at Rev. 14:l-5: (\"~nd I saw, and behold, the Lamb was stand~ng on Mount Z~on, and with hlm were one hundred and forty-four thousand who had his name and his Father's name wrltten on thelr foreheads. (')And I heard a voice out of heaven, 11ke the sound of many waters and l~ke the sound of great thunder. And the sound that I heard was llke the sound of harpists playing on their harps. (3)And they were singing, as ~t were (h~), a new song before the throne, and before the 11vlng be~ngs and the elders. And no one was able to learn that song save the hundred and forty-four thousand who had been redeemed from the earth. (4)These are they who have not been defiled with women, for they are virgins (ohoi ~iotv \" See MILIK and BLACK, The Books ofEnoch, 199."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"132 CHAMER FIVE oi ps?Cj. YVV~LK~V O~K Bpoh6v9qoav, nap86vo~ y&p EIGLV). These are they who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These have been redeemed from humankind as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb. (')And in their mouth no lie has been found (~ai 6v zQ o~6pa~t abrQv obx ~bp6Bq ~IEOF~<). They are unblemished (&popo~). In addition to the allusion to Ezek. 1:24 in Rev. 14:2, the song which can only be sung by those who have been found worthy is very remin- iscent of the heavenly songs that are taught by the angels to the '?ltZ 233113 in the hekhalot tradition (and compare Apoc Abr. 179-21). The first qualification that is required for membership of this elect band is celibacy, since contact with women is evidently understood to be, in and of itself, defiling.86 The second is never to have lied, which may be an allusion to Ps. 101:7 (cf. b.Hag, 14a, A17-19). Thirdly, one must be \"unblemished,\" (apopot = u'nn), which is the condition required, above all, of priests (Lev. 21:16-24, etc.). The statement that they \"have been redeemed .... as firstfruits\" also echoes the status of the priestly clan (see Numb. 3:ll-15, 9:14-22). Further indications of the priestly status of this group, in addition to their celibacy (1 Sam. 21:4; cf. Exod. 19:15), are: the location of this scene on \"Mount Zion,\" which must refer to the heavenly temple (cf. Web. 12:22); their levitical instruments; and the seal of the divine name on their foreheads (Exod. 28:36-38). Possibly, the twenty-four npsopdzepot of Rev. 4:4, etc. are full priests or D'1;113, while the status of this larger group corresponds to that of the Levites, in their role as liturgical musicians.87 In the seer's final vision of the eschatological temple-city of the New Jerusalem, after the sea has given up its dead for the final judgement 86 A number of commentators (e.g., CAIRD,A Commentary, 179) are unwill~ng to accept the plain sense of the text in thls matter. MASSYNGBERDE FORD (Rmlatron, 241-243) rightly llnks celibacy w~th the office of pr~esthood but does not consider the implications of the Idea that the cond~tions of purity obtaining In the temple apply to the heavenly realm and ~ts lnhabltants In perpetuity. See further pp. 192-205 below. 87 The priestly status of the elders 1s clearly apparent ~n Rev. 5:s-9, where they worshlp the sacrificed Lamb, hold~ng \"a harp and golden bowls of Incense, wh~ch are the prayers of the saints\" (see further and compare: HENRY B. SWETE, 73e Apocalypse oJJohn [Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 19061 179; A. FEUILLET, \"The Twenty-Four Elders of the Apocalypse,\" In rdem, Johannlne Studres [New York: AIba House, 19653 183-214; and MASWGBERDE FORD, Rmelat~on, 72-73). Note that the ratio of elders to music- ians IS 1:6,000. THE CELESTIAL PAVEMENT AND THE WATERS OF IMPUFUTY 133 (20:13), we are told that \"the sea was no more\" (Rev. ~1:1).'~ Since \"nothing unclean\" has survived the judgement, a separate area of holi- ness is no longer needed, and so there is no temple in the city (21:22- 27). It is significant, however, that the city street retains the quality of the crystal firmament, being made of \"pure gold, like transparent glass\" (xpuoiov ~aBap6v cbq ijahoq Ftauyqq) (21:21). This necessarily abbreviated study of the New Testament Apocalypse has advanced our enquiry by several small but significant steps. Not only does the author draw on the traditional imagery of the demonic chaos waters and their war against God and his servants, he also inter- poses a barrler between the holy divine realm and the lower world in which the \"water-born\" forces of evil are permitted to have temporary dominion. This barrier is Ezekiel's crystal firmament. Rev. 4:6 is, moreover, the earliest known source to hint at the idea that the heaven- ly \"sea\" is not exactly what it seems. The idea that the firmament, when seen from above, looks like, but is not really, a sea of glass appears to be derived from the repeated \"as if' language of Ezekiel 1 itself. It seems probable that the image of illusory water, which is the central signifier of the hekhalot episode, originated in this same process of exegetical reflection and \"mysticalH imagining on and around Ezekiel 1. We have found that, for the author of Revelation, as for the hekhal- ot writer, the primary purpose of the sea-like crystal firmament is to serve as a barrier between the heavenly realm and the lower world, and above all between that which is pure and that which is unclean. Impur- ity, as in the other sources that we have examined, is strongly associated with sexuality, femininity and the bodily processes of existence in the flesh. Absolute purity, including sexual abstinence, is required of those who seek to penetrate beyond the barrier and to gain admission to the celestial world, since this transition necessitates the transformation of the body from fleshly to spiritual substance (cf. 1 Cor. 15:35-58).89 ', 88 Recent helpful discussions of th~s verse ~nclude: RICHARD BAUCKHAM, The Clzmax ofProphecy: Studtes on the Book oJRevelatron (Edinburgh: T&T Clark, 1993) 56-70; and TFIOMAS E.

Waters ofPtlrity and lrnptlrity As we have seen, the author of Revelation associates the sea and the \"many waters\" of Rev. 17:l with impurity and with the forces of evil. At the end of the book, however, he introduces a contrasting image, derived from Ezek. 47:l-12: And he showed me a nver of water of llfe, brlght as crystal (xozupd v 66~~~05 joiq hup~pd v Oq ~pfio~ahhov), go~ng forth from the throne of God and of the Lamb (Rev. 22:l).92 The seer's description of the New Jerusalem, where the source of this liv- ing water is located, embodies the imagery of the heavenly temple and the celestial Paradise. This living water is thus a heavenly substance, providing spiritual su~tenance.~~ Unlike the demonic waters previously mentioned, which are evidently associated with carnality and pollution, this spiritual water is a purifying agent, immersion in which is required of those who seek to enter the holy city: ('4)~lessed are those who wash thelr robes, so that they will have the right to the tree of life and may enter by the gates. ('5)Outside are the dogs, the sorcerers, the forn~cators, the murderers, the ~dolaters, and all those who love and practlce falsehood (Rev. 22:14-15).

For this Christian author, Christ's sacrificial blood has been transformed into the clear living water that is given to the saints, of which they drink (Rev. 21:6, 22:17), and in which those who would enter the gates of heaven must first be purified. The image of life-giving and purifying water is frequently encoun- tered in the Qumran Hodayot, where it symbolizes the heavenly wisdom which has been revealed to the inspired teacher and his followers, and I which leads the way to righteousness: YOU have opened a sprlng i13~2.Y 792. ;mnns ii[ ] I in the mouth of your servant, on his tongue you have inscr~bed ;in7717 [ ] i11~hl I the cord [.. ] [to] announce your knowledge mr2n i~7L) ymv[ ]li) '7~ to your creature, to explaln these matters .11ln3 -19~5 [ ] TT>K~ (sic) ~\"nh1 to dust such as me.

As in the water vision episode (HZ.D2), these impure waters are associated with idolatry, or the worship of demons, and the function of the firmament is to maintain a separation between these evil forces and the dwelling place of God. Although this midrash is clearly related to the traditional background of the water vision episode, how- ever, an important difference must be observed. Here, as in the Book of Revelation and in the Qumran Hoduyot, the upper waters are located above the celestial firmament and are spiritual in nature, having God or his throne as their source. The water vision episode in HZ, by con- trast, does not distinguish between material and spiritual water, and appears rather to stand in the literary tradition represented by such sources as Test. Lev. 2:6-3:5 and y.Hug. 77c, in which the heavenly sanct- uary is located above the upper waters and separated from them by a further firmament or firmaments.

The Waters ofMaten;zlig A similar association of water with materiality, impurity and femininity is found in two Gnostic treatises, Hypostaszs ofthe Archons and On the Origin ofthe World (a.k.a. \"the Untitled Treatise\").' The two documents are closely related by way of common source traditions, some of which are undoubtedly Jewish. Both were probably composed in Egypt during the third or very early fourth centuries CE, the former being in all likeli- hood slightly earlier than the latter. Originally written in Greek, they were translated into the Coptic versions found at Nag Hammadi before the end of the fourth century CE.' The Jewish sources to which both texts are indebted can therefore be dated with fair confidence to the late second or early third century CE, at latest. The origins of the HZ liter- ary tradition have been located in the same period. The author of Orig. World begins by stating the premise that, contr- ary to the prevailing opinion of both human beings and worldly deities, the chaos-darkness from which the material and psychic universe was formed was not a pre-existent reality, but a shadow cast by the \"first product\" of the spiritual world of the \"immortal beings\" or aeons, which has already come into being at the point where he begins his narrative. This \"first product,\" he tells us, was the light proceeding from Sophia, the likeness emanated by Pistis, who is one of the immort- al aeons: This treatise should not, however, be confused with the Untitled Ti (U7) in the Bruce Codex. See further below. See ROGER A. BULLARD, \"Introduct~on\" to Hyp Arch., and HANS-GEBHARD BETHGE, \"Introduct~on\" to Ong.

After the natural structure of the immortal beings had completely developed out of the infinite, a likeness then emanated from Pistis (Faith); it is called Sophia (Wisdom). It exercised volition and became a product resembling the primeval iight. And immediately her will manifested itself as a likeness of heaven, having an unimaginable magnitude; it was between the immortal beings and those things that came into being after them, like [...I; she (Sophia) functioned as a veil divid- ing mankind from the things above. 5. Now the eternal realm (aeon) of truth has no shadow outside it, for the limitless light is everywhere within it. But its exterior is shadow, which has been called by the name darkness. From it, there appeared a force, presiding over the darlc- ness. And the forces that came into being subsequent to them called the shadow \"the limitless chaos.\" From it, every [kind] of divinity sprouted up [...I together with the entire place, [so that] also, [shadow] is posterior to the first product. It was <in> the abyss that [it] (shadow) appeared, deriving from the aforementioned Pistis. 6. Then shadow perceived that there was something mightier than it, and felt envy; and when it had become pregnant of its own accord, suddenly it engendered jealousy. Since that day, the principle of jealousy among alljhe eternal realms (aeons) and their worlds has been apparent. Now as for that jealousy, it was found to be an abortion without any spirit in it. Like a shadow it came into existence in a vast watery substance. 'Then the bile that had come into being out of the shadow was thrown into a part of chaos. 7. Since that day, a watery substance has been apparent. And what sanK within it flowed away, being visible in chaos: as with a woman giving birth to her child - ail her superfluities flow out; just so, matter came into being out of a shadow and was projected apart. And it (viz., matter) did not depart from chaos; rather, matter was in chaos, being in a part of it. 8. And when these thlngs had come to pass, then Plstls came and appeared over the matter of chaos, whlch had been expelled like an aborted foetus - since there was no spirlt In ~t. For all of ~t (vlz., chaos) was l~mltless darkness and bottomless water.4 BETHGE, LAYTON et al. (see the follow~ng note) report that the meanlng of thls Coptlc verb is uncertain. 0%.

Like Judan Nesiya and Leazar aty.ag. 77c,' the Gnostic author is concerned to deny the belief that this pnma materia existed prior to creation. It was produced, he tells us, as a by-product of \"jealousy,\" the spiritless abortion conceived in the womb of \"shadow,\" i.e., chaos, which is a product of Sophia, who is herself \"a product [of Pistis] resembling the primeval light\" (0% World, 54). Subsequently, Pistis Sophia (now regarded as a single entity in two aspects) causes this life- less aborted fetus to become animated and to assume the form of the ignorant but powerful lion-like demiurgeyaldabaoth-Samael, who, seeing nothing other than himself but darkness and water, believes himself to be the supreme, pre-existent deity. This thought, taking verbal form, becomes the \"spirit of God, moving to and fro upon the waters\" (Gen. 1:Z). The demiurge then causes solid matter, corresponding to the \"dry land\" of Gen. 1:9, to emerge from the wateryprima m~teria.~ Thus, the creation of the demiurge does not extend beyond the material realm, which, according to this source, includes the heavens created by him for his offspring: 19. Now the prime parent (apx~yavg~op) Yaldabaoth, since he possessed great authorltles, created heavens for each of 111s offspring through verbal expresslon - created them beautiful, as dwelllng places - and In each heaven he created great glories, seven tlmes excellent. Thrones and mansions and temples, and also charlots and vzrgrn sptnts up to an rnv~srble one dnd their giones, each one has these in hls heaven; mighty armies of gods and lords and angels and archangels - countless myriads - so that they might serve. 20. The account of these matters you (sg.) wlll find in a precise manner in the first Account (h6yo5) of Oraza. 21. And they were completed from this [first] heaven to as far up as the sixth heaven, namely that of Sophia? Hyp. Arch. begins with a summarized version of what seems to be basic- ally the same myth, save that the events are given in a different order. See pp. 123-124 above. See Ong. Worid, 999-14 (NHC 11.9929-101,9), ed. LAYTON, trans. BETHGE, LAYTON el al., 32-35. ' Ong. World, 9319-21 (NHC ii.102,ll-26), ed. LAYTON, trans. BETHGE, LAYTON, el al., 38-39 (Greek script added). SOME GNOSTIC AND CHRISTIAN SOURCES 141 Here, the scene opens with Samael's declaration that \"It is I who am God; there is none [apart from me],\" and this utterance descends \"to chaos and the abyss, his mother,\" pursued by Samael himself, \"at the instigation of Pistis Sophia.\"8 Samael's blasphemous utterance thus appears to perform the role of the \"abortion\" of \"jealousy\" in Ong. World, 56. Only after these events, do we find the following: 4. As incorruptibility looked down into the region of the waters, her image appear- ed in the waters; and the authorities of the darkness became enamored of her. But they could not lay hold of that image, which had appeared to them in the waters, because of their weakness - since beings that merely possess a soul cannot lay hold of those that possess a spirit - for they were from below, while it was from above.\" This passage seems to correspond to Or&. World, 98, \"incorruptibility\" being a term for Pistis Sophia. Here, however, it is Sophia herself who is identified as the Spirit of God moving upon the waters.'' It thus appears that this author has applied a different interpretation to the same traditional mythology, much of which is quite clearly of Jewish origin. Later, however, he refers to the same form of the myth as that found in Or& World, 554-14: 22 And the great angel Eleleth, understdnding, spoke to me: \"Wlthln limitless realms dwells incorruptibihty. Sophla, who is called Pistls, wanted to create something, alone wlthout her consort, and her product was a celest~al thing. \"A veil exists between the world above and the realms that are below; and shadow came Into being beneath the veil; and that shadow became matter; and that shadow was projected apart. And what she had created became a product In the matter, hlce an aborted fetus. And it assumed a plastlc form molded out of shadow, and became an arrogant beast resernbllng a Ilon.\" It was androgyn- ous, as I have already sad, because it was from matter that it derived. 23. \"Openlng hxs eyes he saw a vast quantity of matter wlthout Iimlt; and he became arrogant, saying, 'It is I who am God, and there is none other apart from me.'

And a voice came forth from above the realm of absolute power, saying, 'You are mistaken, Samael' - which is 'god of the blind.\"'\" In both these Gnostic texts, the material and spiritual worlds are radical- ly distinguished from each other, being characterized by the opposing qualities of darkness/light and corruptibility/incorruptibility. Later, in terms reminiscent of the motif of purifying water found in Revelation and the Qumran Hohyot, the author of 0% World informs us that 48. .... the water was purified through the likeness of Pistis Sophia, who had appeared to the prime parent in the waters. Justly, then, it has been said: \"through the waters.\" The holy water, since it vivifies the all, purifies it.I2 In both sources, however, the symbol of water is primarily associated with materiality and corruptibility, and with the unclean by-products of bodily birth. This is congruent, in general terms at least, with the dominant symbolism of the passages from the Hodayot, Revelation, and y.Hag. 77c which were considered in the previous chapter, and also with the angels' disgust at the substance and smell of those \"born of women\" in the hekhalot texts and the Moses midrashim. These similarities do not, of course, imply that the non-Gnostic Jewish and Christian sources embody the full-fledged Gnostic ideology of the two texts from Nag Hammadi. What defines these texts as Gnostic is the doctrine that the God of Genesis is himself an animal product of the material realm, that both he and his worshippers are deluded, and that the true knowledge (yvGjotq) confers liberation from his material kingdom. These ideas, which are in themselves quite foreign to the non-Gnostic sources, appear to represent a \"mutation\" of a strain of Jewish apocalyptic and mystical tradition which believed the material world and the processes of nature to be inherently impure, because corrupted by and subordinated to the demonic forces of unholiness and chaos. This strain of tradition, the influence of which has been encountered in a variety of sources, seems to have associated these qualities of the material universe with the feminine, maternal principle. This principle was in turn associated with Hyp. Arch., 5922-23 (NHC ~i.942-26), ed., trans. LAYTON, 252-253. l2 Ong. World, $48 (NHC ii.10828-109,1), ed. LAYTON, trans. BETHGE, LAYTON et al., 52-53.

The fiery, adamantine substance of the heavenly world thus stands in radical opposition to the corruptible substance of earthly matter, which, accord- ing to this tradition, originated in the chaos waters. In the Jewisp sources, as we have seen, the two realms are separated by a shining firm- ament, which is also the pavement of God's dwelling. In Hyp. Arch., $22, this function is performed by a veil. According to 0% World, $4, this veil is apparently identical with Sophia herself.13 A different version of the myth of Pistis Sophia occurs in Books 1-3 of the compendious and rambling compilation now known by the title Pistis Sophia, composed in Egypt during the late third century cE.14 Here, Sophia herself is imprisoned and persecuted by the archons of the material universe, from whose power she is finally rescued by the Savior, Je~us.'~ Prior to her deliverance, Sophia recites a series of thirteen songs of repentance (p~~&vota), the first of which begins as follows: 0 Light of Lights, in whom I believed from the beginning, hear my repentance now at this time, O Light; save me, 0 Light, for wicked thoughts have entered into me. I loolted, 0 Light, to the parts below. I saw a light in that place, and I thought: I will go to that place to receive that light. And I went, and I came to be in the darkness which is in the Chaos below. And I was not able to proceed out to go to my place, because I was oppressed among all the emanations of the Authades. And the lion-faced power took away my light.16 A little later, Maria the mother of Jesus interprets this lament in a way which is clearly related to the traditions that we have been considering: Hear now that I may speak concerning the repentance (p~dvo~a) which the Pistis Sophia said, as she spoke of her sin, and all the things which had happened '-'See pp. 139 and 141 above. l4 On the dates of the components of PIJ~IS Sopb~a and the Books flew, see CARL SCHMIDT, ed. and trans, Gnostzsche Scbnften zn koptzscher Spracheaus dem Codex Bmnanus (TU 8; Le~pzig Hlnrichs, 1892) 579-598, but note the reservations of FALLON (The Enthronement ofSubaoth, 127, n. 107) wlth regard to some of SCHMIDT'S conclusions. l5 See especially Pzsfzstls Sophra 1.29-3 1 (41,2546,27), 1.58-2.67 (112,6-149,s) and 2.81- 82 (178,l-184,6) In SCHMIDT, ed., and VIOLET MACDERMOT, trans., Pistis Sophza (CGL; NHS 9; Leiden: Brill, 1978) 82-105, 224-299, and 356-369.

TEe Realm ofAir and Light In the fourth book of Pistis Sophia, which seems to be somewhat earlier than Books 1-3,18 we find an account of what appears to be a heavenly ascent by the post-resurrection Jesus, along with his disciples. Following a vision in which the heavens and the earth, with its mountains and its seas, all \"flee to the west,\" we are told: .... And Jesus with his disciples remained in the Midst in an airy place (~67~0~ dt6p~voq) in the way of the Midst which is below the sphere (04aipa). And they came to the first rank of the way of the Midst. But Jesus stood in the air (&?p) of its place with his disciples. The disciples of Jesus said to him: \"What is this place in which we are?\" Jesus said: \"These are the of the way of the Midst. For it happened, when the archons of the Adamas rebelled, and they continued to be concerned with sexual intercourse, begettingarchons and archangels and angels and ministers and decans, then Jeu, the Father of my Father, came from the right. He bound them in a Heimarmene-sphere. For there were twelve aeons; Sabaoth, the Adamas, ruled over six, and Jabraoth, his brother, ruled over the other six. Now then Jabraoth believed in the mysteries of the light with his archons. And he practised the mysteries of the light and he abandoned tlle mystery of sexual intercourse. But Sabaoth, the Adamas, with his archons, continued to practise sexual inter- course. And when Jeu, the father of my father, saw that Jabraoth believed, he carried him with all his archons which had believed with him, he received him to himself in the sphere, he took hinl to a purified air in the presence of the light of the sun, between the places of those of the Midst and between the places of the Invisible God. He placed him there with the archons which had believed in him. And he carried Sabaoth, the Adamas, with his archons which did not , practise the mysteries of the light but continued to practise the mysteries of sexual intercourse. He bound them within the sphere.'' l7 PisfisSophia, 1.33 (5222-53,3), ed. SCHMIDT, trans. MACDERMOT, 104-107 (Greek script added).

I SOME GNOSTIC AND CHRISTIAN SOURCES 145 1 It is not necessary, for the purpose of this study, to explain every cosm- I ological detail of this account. It IS, however, worth observing that Jesus and his disciples are described as standing upon the \"purified air\" of the realm of Jabraoth, which is outslde the sphere of fate (dpap- pSv~) in which Sabaoth and his archons are confined, and that admiss- ion to this pure, exalted realm appears to be contingent on the renunc- iation of sexual intercourse. Following a long cosmological and astrol- ogical discourse on the ruling powers and mechanisms of the sphere of fate, Jesus assures his disciples that he is about to give them the keys of the kingdom of heaven, which will enable them to compel the lower powers to submit to them. When Jesus had said these thlngs, he sang praise to the great name. The places of the way of the Mldst were concealed, and Jesus with his disciples remained upon an alr of very strong The motif of standlng upon \"air of light\" recalls the airy firmament of Apoc.

The context of this imagery in Ephesians is primarily one of \"realized eschatology,\" but in 1 Thessalonians we find the following future-eschatological prophetic statement: (16) The Lord himself, with a cry of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with a trumpet of God, will descend from heaven.

Origen continues: It is necessary, therefore, to speak in such a way of the abode in the air (& aeria sede). For I think that the saints who depart from this life will dwell in a place situated on tile earth, which holy scripture calls Paradise, as if in a place of instruction or, so to speak, a classroom or school for souls, in which they may be taught about all the things that they had seen on earth, and also to receive some indications concerning things that are to follow in the future - just as in this life they had received some intimations of future events, albeit in a mirror dimly (I Cor. 13:12), but nonetheless in part, which in their proper time and place will be revealed more clearly and more lucidly to the saints. If anyone be whole of heart, with a purer intelligence and a more highly trained perception, he will progress more swiftly and ascend to a place of air, and arrive in the heav- enly realms (uelocius proficiens cito it ad aeris locum mcendet et ad caelorum regna perueniet) by way of those various places - habitations (mansiones), so to speak - which the Greeks have called \"spheres\" (o$ctipaq), i.e., globes klobos), but which holy scripture has in truth named \"heavens\" (caelos). In each of these places, he will first see the things that are done there, and secondly, he will discover the reason why they are so done, and thus he will pass through each level in order, following him who has entered into the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, who says: I desire that where I am, these loo may be Un. 17:24). And he indicates this diversity of places when he says: In my Father3 house there are many habi/ations an. 14:2).14 The similarities between this text and UT, 520 are very striking. Both writers associate entry into the airy realm with the giving and receiving of instruction about the concealed principles by which the universe is governed. Both are at pains to emphasize the principles of hierarchy and order in connection with the soul's ascent. Both allude to Ephes- ians 2. It is clear, then, that Origen and the authors of the Gnostic texts drew from a common reservoir of traditional imagery concerning an incorruptible realm of pure light-air located above the material, mutable world at the boundary of the divine sphere. While it should not be assumed that Origen's platonizing interpretation of Eph. 2:2 and 1 Thess. 4:16-17 accurately reflects the original meaning of these New Testament passages, the image of a land of pure air and light beyond the firmament above the earth has been encountered in a variety of 34 Origen, Depnnnp, 11.1 1.6,213-235, In HENRI CROUZEL and MANLlO SIMONETTI, eds, and trans., Ongine.

Independent testimony to the tradition of the ethereal realm is provided by a passage of the Hermetic tractate Asclepius.

The bodies are tormented (in) various ways. Sometimes they are cast upon raging waters; at other times they are cast down into the fire in order that it may destroy them. No trace of Christian influence is apparent in either of these texts. The Latin version appears to be a fairly typical product of hellenistic theo- sophical speculation and is, in and of itself, of little relevance to this study. The Coptic version, however, betrays the influence of the Jewish heavenly ascent tradition. The combined imagery of \"a great fire, and crystal water .... and a great upheaval\" is, as we have seen, very typical of the apocalyptic sources and is ultimately derived from the language of Ezekiel 1 itself. Since this version is probably closer to the original, it is likely that the Latin recension has been rewritten by a hellenistic or late antique redactor for whom such Jewish apocalyptic details were no longer meaningful. If so, the two versions of this interesting text provide evidence of a developmental trajectory which originated in Jewish apocalypticism and culminated in a fully hellenized theosophy. This being the case, the expression \"the open sea of the air of the world\" in the Coptic text may well be derived from the same traditional background as the wave-like \"brilliant air\" of the celestial pavement as described in the water vision episode in HZ.

CHAPTER SEVEN TEMPLE VEILS AND CELESTIAL FIRMAMENTS 1. The Enthronement of Sabaorh In both Ong. World and Hyp. Arch, the spiritual and material worlds are separated by a veil (0% World, $4: napan6~aopa; Hyp. Arch., 322: ~a~antlzaapa). Matter itself is said to be the shadow of the realm of light, projected through that veil,' which, according to 0% World, §4, is identical with Sophia herself. The supposition that the veil of Sophia corresponds to (one of) the firmament(s) of the Jewish apocalyptic and 7131)3 tradition is confirmed by the following passage from the eschat- ological section at the end of the treatise: 144. Then the sun will become dark. And the moon will cause its light to cease. The stars of the sky will cancel their circuits. And a great clap of thunder will come out of a great force that is above all the forces of chaos, where the firmament of the woman is situated. Maving created the first ~roduct, she will put away the wise fire of intelligence and clothe herself with irrational wrath. 145. Then she will pursue the gods of chaos, whom she created along with the prime parent. She wlll cast them dowr~ Into the abyss. They wlll be obliterated because of their wickedness ....' If we combine this information with that given in Orig. World, it would appear that the veil - or firmament - of Sophia is located in the sixth heaven. This is not, however, consistent with the cosmological system of the treatise as a whole, according to which the seven heavens are assigned to the seven sons of Yaldabaoth with their retinues, and the separation between the realm of the aeons and the material universe is located above the seventh heaven.\" This model, which is encountered ' See BULLARD, \"Commentary\" in rdem, Hypostasts ofthe Archons, 104-105.

TEMPLE VEILS AND CELESTIAL FIRMAMENTS 159 of the curtains of the tabernacle or temple, as encountered in a wide variety of Jewish sources. Philo, describing the tabernacle, states that the veil between the outer tent and the holy of holies represents the separat- ion between the mutable and immutable worlds: What is rhe veil (Exod. 26:31)? By the veil the inside (= the holy of holies) is set off and separated from the things outside, for the inside is holy and truly divine, while the outside, though it is also holy, does not attain the same nature or a similar one. Moreover, it indicates the changeable parts of the world which are sublunary and undergo changes of direction, and the heavenly (region) which is without transient events and is unchanging. And (it shows) how they are set off and separated from one another, for the ethereal and airy substance is, as it were, a covering (6x6 zq< ai0spia: ~ai dc~piaq obcria~ citq ~ahdppa~o~) .... What is the meaning of the words, Thou shalt set apart fhe veil between the holy 4 holies (Exod. 26:33)? I have said that the simple holy (parts of the tabernacle) are classified with the sense-perceptible heaven (s&rzaza~ ~azd zbv aicr0qzdv o6pav6v), where- as the inner (parts), which are called the holy of holies, (are classified) with the intelligible world (~az& zbv voq72,v ~dirspov). The incorporeal world is set off and separated from the visible one by the mediating Logos as by a veil .... so that there is between them something (at once) invisible and visible of substanceJ4 A very similar symbolic interpretation of the tabernacle is recorded by Josephus, who describes the interior of the tent as follows: As for the ~ns~de, he (Moses) dlvided ~ts length Into three sections. At a meas- ured distance of ten cubits from the innermost part, he placed four plllars . .. the space within these pillars was the most holy place (diiuzov), but the rest of the tabernacle was open for the priests. The measurements of the division of the tent were, In fact, an imitation of the whole of nature: the third section, inslde the ' four pillars, to which the priests were not admitted, was like a heaven peculiar to God; whereas the space of twenty cubits was like sea and land which are Inhabited by men, and so thls part was reserved for the priests ....

A second curtain, equivalent in size, texture and color to the first, covered the five pillars that stood at the entrance. It was supported by rings at the corner of each pillar and hung down from the top to the middle of the pillar, the rest being left as a passage for the priests to enter beneath it. Over this, there was a linen veil (@paos) of the same dimensions ....Is Following this, Josephus goes on to describe the curtains that covered the exterior of the tent, including an outer layer of skins (cf. Exod. 26:14) which, seen from a distance, \"seemed not at all to differ from the color of the sky.\"16 In these sources, as observed by HOFIUS: \".... the idea of a curtain between heaven and earth 1s so strongly anchored in the symbolic meanlng of the tabernacle that it can only be understood In connection w~th tills meaning.\"17 This symbolic correspondence is also encountered in rabbinic traditions about the tabernacle:I8 R.

HOFIUS believes this symbolism to be of non-rabbinic, \"hellenistic Jew- ish\" origin and attributes the above passage to a rabbinic author who, he thinks, was seeking to construct a biblical-exegetical basis for \"the hellenistic-Judaic Theologoumenon of the universal temple.\"\" This theoiy is, of course, unnecessary, since it is now known that the cosmic temple, far from being an exclusively \"hellenistic\" Jewish concept, was a central motif of the apocalyptic and 3231?2 traditions.\" 1 3. 'VeilJ' as the Name of the First I-leaven According to a widespread rabbinic tradition, \"Veil\" (jll)'l, from Greek @fjLov or Latin velum2') is the name of the lowest of the seven heav- ens, that above it being called \"firmament\" (~7Pl). The opening and closing of the 11i71 are said to mark the distinction between day and night:z2 Resh Laqish said: There are seven (heavens), and these are they: ,1lYn ,5131 ,D'i)nW ,Y7i)1 ,115'1 n131y ,112n. 11'7~1 has no purpose, save that it comes in in the morning and goes out in the evening, and renews the work of creation every day, as it is said, Who stretches out the heavens like a curtain, and spreads them out as a tent to dwell in (;i~i32 '7~~7 nn~nal D:DI$ 772) (Isa. 40:22). y7i)l is that in which the sun, the moon, the stars and constellations are set, as it is said, and God set them in thefir- mament of heaven (Gen. 1:17).

According to the TosaJ ot, however, the 71571 is the opaque covering of the daytime sky, which is drawn aside to reveal the starry firmament at night. Midrash Konen agrees with the latter explanation: Why is it called 115'11? Because it is like a, royal standard (u'2in ~UI TnD) which is brought in through the gate of a royal palace. When the king goes into his palace, it is brought in, and when he goes out, it is carried forth. In the same way, at dawn, when the sun comes forth to minister to the world (1151~1 vnwj), the 115')l is spread out in the world and covers the surface of the firmament Y1i?l) from the sun's orb as it travels through the world. And when the sun goes in, it is rolled up and taken away, so that the moon may rise, with the stars and the planets, to shine upon the surface of the earth, which is five hundred years' journey from 111)'l.~~ The relationship described here between 71171 and Y7i71 is rather remin- iscent of that between the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle and its linen veil, as described by Josephus. The word 11571 is, in fact, applied to this curtain (MT: 1PQ) at Tg. Ps.J Exod. 36:37.25 In terms of the cosmic tabernacle/temple structure, however, the lowest of the heavenly levels corresponds more naturally to the curtain around the outer court (Exod. 27:9-18), which Josephus describes as follows: .... a cloth of fine Ilnen, woven of many colors (o~v6dv 6' &K Pdcrcrou ~OLKL- hw76~q), went around all the plllars, and hung down In full, loose folds from thelr capltals to their bases, and enclosed the whole space In such a way that it seemed not unlilce a wall around it.Z6 It must be conceded that the loan-word 11'771, used in the ordinary sense of ''veil'' or \"curtain,\" is not generally associated with the tabernacle or the temple in rabbinic sources, and that the heavenly lli?, though associated with the tent imagery of Isa. 40:22;~ is nowhere explicitly out\" In the daytlme. 24 M~drash Konen, ed.

Nonetheless, it is ~ossible to discern in them the broad outlines and essential features, at least, of a developing tradition of symbolism regarding the veils of the temple, and its princi- pal variations. 4. The Veils of the Temple In the biblical tabernacle, there are three points at which a screen or curtain (1PQ) is said to have been located: at the entrance to the outer c~urt;'~ at the entrance to the sanctuary tent;30 and between the sanct- uary and the holy of holies, the last being called the TPQ;! n373 (\"the veil of the ~creen\")~' or, more simply, the n1)~g.~' LXX designates these three curtains by the terms ~dchuppa (\"covering\"), E;?lionao.cpov (\"screen\"), and ~a.canC.caopa (\"veil\") respectively. Philo likewise uses ~uzanE'.caopa of the innermost curtain, but applies ~dlLuppa to that at the entrance to the sanctuary and refers to the outermost curtain as ij$aopa (\"a woven Josephus uses the terms +&po05, ii+05, and o~v6dv, apparently without distinction, when describing the taber- na~le,~~ but in the context of the temple, he applies ~a.canG.caopa to the curtain at the entrance to the outer san~tuary.'~ These three points 28 On 1151? in rabblnic literature, see JASTROW, Dzctzonary, 373a-b, and the references clted there, but note the exceptional case, cited above, of Tg.

In biblical descriptions of the Jerusalem temple, the second and third divisions (i.e., the entrances to the sanctuary and the holy of holies) are marked by double doors, which are cawed with cherubim, palm trees andjmers, and overlaid withgold. These, however, appear to be add- itional to the curtains, rather than displacing them.37 This is certainly true of the entrance to the holy of holies, according to the chronicler, who tells us that Solomon .... made the veil (n2'i?i_i) ofblue, purple, crimson andfi'ne linen, and worked cherubim upon it (2 Chron. 3:14). 5. 7;11e Curtain Before the TErone In rabbinic sources, and occasionally in the hekhalot literature, we find a heavenly counterpart of the 173'13 in the curtain that hangs at the en- trance to the divine throne room (i.e., the holy of holies of the cosmic tempie). This curtain is called by the non-biblical term ~1219?~ In a few texts, the celestial '71213 is identified with the dark cloud in which, according to more than one text of scripture, God's Glory is concealed.

The act of riding a horse in front of the temple on a Day of Atonement on a sabbath is presumably to be understood as a cumulative sequence of acts of defiance, but the narrative remains somewhat unsatisfactory, since it fails to explain why this particular offence should be held to merit such dire and irrevocable condemnation. Moreover, the element of riding on a sabbath is itself derived from the context in which the dialogue is set. The Babylonian version, on the other hand, alludes to the story of Elisha's disastrous encounter with Metatron, where a hi;) nl makes the same pronounce- ment following his utterance of the \"two powers\" heresy, and this, almost certainly, is the original context of the saying.48 The story of this encounter is given in 3 Enoch 16:l-5, where the hi7 n3 comes forth \"from the presence of the Shekhir~ah,\"~ and the 71n3 is not mention- ed.

The fact that the concluding pronouncement of the story incorporates a quotat- I ion from Jeremiah suggests that it may be derived from the same store of traditions linking the 71119 to the judgement scenario as the genizah fragment considered on page 166 above. As we have observed, a strong aroma of predeterminist theology seems to cling to these traditions about the 71113. Possibly, therefore, the excision of the detail in some sources reflects the redactors' discomfort with regard to the implication that Elisha's fate and the denial of even the possibilrty of repentance to him, being foreknown by God, may also have been predestined. 6. TZe Locutions ofthe Veils in Jewish and Gnostic Sources It may be the case, as both HOFIUS and GRUE~~VALD maintain, that the cultically-derived traditions about the 71113 were originally quite distinct from those concerning the veil-as-firmament (115'1).~~ It is, however, clear from the testimony of Phi10 and Josephus that by the first century CE the two traditions had already become closely interwoven with each other. In Jewish apocalyptic and ?I23173 mysticism, as we have seen, the pilgrimage through the precincts of the temple and the ascent into heav- en are one and the same thing. The close interpenetration of \"veil\" and \"firmament\" symbolism in this context can be detected inApoc, Abr. 21- 29, where Abraham is shown the secrets of the creation, including the I 50 Thus b.ljag. 15a, mss.

The fact that this powerful motif is able to \"migrate\" between the curtain and the firmament indicates a degree of correspondence between the two that approaches virtual ident- ity. Reverse confirmation, so to speak, is provided by Josephus, who describes the curtain at the entrance to the outer sanctuary in terms that leave us in no doubt as to its symbolic significance: Before these (the doors of the sanctuary) there hung a veil (~ol~ani~aopa), of the same length, of Babylon~an tapestry, embroidered w~th blue, fine hen, scarlet and purple, a wondrous plece of artistry. Thls mlxture of colors was not w~thout a splr~tual meanlng (dlQ~6pq~ov); rather, ~t was a klnd of Image of the universe (6ox~p EtK6va sQv Bhwv). For it seemed that the scarlet symbolized fire, hen the earth, blue the alr, and purple the sea. In two cases, the comparison was based on color, but In those of the linen and the purple it was a matter of orlgln, slnce one 1s produced by the earth, the other by the sea Ernbro~dered upon ~t was a panorama of the whole heavens, except for the zodlacai slgns (~assy6ypanto 6' b ninho~ &xaaav sfiv otjpciv~ov 8copiav nhdv T&V <w6iov) '' Josephus' comment that \"the signs of the zodiac\" were excluded from the design is interesting in that it parallels his remark in Ant. iii.126 I that \"the forms of living creatures\" were exc1uded,s4 in flat contradict- ion of the biblical instruction to embroider images of cherubim on the n3'1?.55 Wile it is probably true that Josephus' denial is intended to counter the accusation of animal-worship directed against the Jews?6 I there can be little doubt that in both texts he is referring specifically to the D52713, which he equates with both the zodiacal signs and Ezekiel's \"living creatures.\" In the cosmic temple structure of the Jewish apocalyptic and ;if31!2 tradition, there were, as observed above, two principal lines of separat- ion between the spheres of the holy and the unholy. These boundaries were demarcated by the curtain before the holy of holies (the 71279 or ria??) and that at the entrance to the outer sanctuary, corresponding to 53 Josephus, War, v.212-214 (ed. THACKERAY et ai., 3.264). 54 See p. 160 above. 55 Exod. 26:3 1, etc. '\"ee THACKERAY'S note in idem ef aL, Josephus, 4.375."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"170 CHAPTER SEVEN TEMPLE VEILS AND CELESTIAL FIRMAMENTS 171 the seventh and sixth firmaments respectively. Thus, when Aqiba states, in the hekhalot version of the d719 story, that he \"arrived at the 7lll9\" (HZ/MR:C2), this seems to place him inside the sixth hyil (i.e., the out- er sanctuary), at the entrance to the seventh (i.e., the holy of holies). Alternatively, it is conceivable (though, on balance, unlikely) that the term 71119 refers in this instance to the curtain at the entrance to the outer sanctuary. The latter location corresponds to that of the encount- er with the gatekeepers and their invitation to \"enter\" the sixth >37;1; the former (according to the analysis proposed above) to the water vision episode itse1f.j7 The Gnostic veil between the pleroma and the material universe is clearly a version of the 71279 or n39, but it has been moved up a level in accordance with the new cosmology. In the tradit- ional Jewish temple structure, the area of greatest holiness is the seventh heaven where God sits enthroned, and the 7fm3 is spread before him, at the boundary between levels six and seven. In the Gnostic system as presented in Hyp. Arch. and 0% World, however, Sabaoth, who is no longer God, sits \"below\" the veil, outside the sphere of the pleroma. The veil or firmament, therefore, is located not between the sixth and seventh levels, but between the seventh and the eighth. So far as I am aware, however, there is no mention in any Gnostic source other than 0% World, $21 of a boundary within the lower heavens that would correspond to the division between levels five and six in the hekhalot tradition. The anomalous location of Sophia's heaven on the sixth level at Orig. World, 521 is, then, almost certainly attributable to a Jewish source reproduced by the Gnostic author, who appears to have overlook- ed the contradiction between that source and his own preferred system of cosmology. The fact that this location corresponds to that of the pavement of the sixth 4372 in HZ indicates that the Jewish sources to which the Gnostic writers were indebted were closely related to those employed by the hekhalot author(s) of the water vision episode. It should be noted that some passages of the hekhalot literature demonstrate an awareness of the distinction between the seventh heaven, where God appears in his ffll) on the iil3lD to receive the worship of his creatures, and the countless hidden realms above and beyond that 57 See p. 78 above. level in which he dwells invisible and alone.'' This idea is introduced, following the discussion of the seven firmaments from 115'11 to nlInY, in b.Hag. 13a: R. Aha b. Jacob said: There is yet another heaven above the heads of the nl'il, as it is written: And above the heads oJlhe living creatures was the likeness ofaJirmamen~ like the appearanu of terrible ice, stretched out over their headrjom atrove (Ezek. 1:22). Up to here, you are permitted to speak, but from here on you are not permitted to speak, as it is written in the book of Ben Sira: Do not inte~pref mailers loo wonderfuijoryo2c, or investigate thai which is concealed/romyou. RcJect upon ihaf which is perrnilted to you, joryou have no business with concealed things. (Ecclus. 3:21-22). What appears to be a reference to a vision of these dimensions of divin- ity beyond the seventh heaven is found in the final chapter of A4tz%eh Merkabah:\" Rabbi Ishmael said: I said to Rabbi Aqiba: How 1s one able to look upwards beyond the seraph- im that stand above the head of \"Tll, the LORD God of Israel? He said to me: When I had ascended to the first palace, I prayed a prayer, and I saw from the palace of the first firmament as far as the seventh palace.60 And as soon as I had ascended to the seventh palace, I ~ronounced the names of two angels, and I gazed upwards beyond the seraphlm. And these are they: 7751~ 171D. And as soon as I had pronounced thelr names, they came and took hold of me and said to me: Son of man, do not be afrald. He 1s the holy klng who is sanctified upon the high and exalted throne, and he 1s excellent for ever and malest~c upon the it33in! In that hour, I saw upwards beyond the seraphlm that stand above the head of 7'lTll, the LORD God of Israel. This passage is, however, exceptional. Generally speaking, the hekhalot writers do not transgress the limits recommended by Ben Sira. The primary focus of their interest is the vision of the manifest Glory on the throne, and the hidden dimensions of the Deity beyond this vision 58 See MORRAY-JONES, \"Transformat~onal Mysticism,\" 2-6 and 21, and the sources cited there. 59 MM, 933, ed.

This being so, there is no barrier between the seventh 53?;7, the holy of holies where the visible manifestation of the divine image occurs, and the higher regions beyond that. The holy of holies is supremely holy precisely because of its openness and accessibil- ity to the Divine Being in ail its fullness. The protective barriers be- tween the holy, the less holy, and the unholy are located below (or \"out- side\") this level, at the threshold of the holy of holies, at the entrance of the sanctuary (= the sixth gate), and so by degrees to the outer court and to the mundane world. Hence, the 71313 is not located, as in the Gnostic sources, beyond the seventh heaven. GRUENWALD, \"Jewish Sources?\" 215-217. CHAPTER EIGHT THE FACES OF THE CHARIOT 1. l;l/e Ascent Continues (Massekhet Hekhalot, $28) The above discussion has, to the best of my knowledge, accounted for every instance of the term 71313 in the published texts of the hekhalot corpus.' The term n3113 occurs only in two texts, which contain paral- lel recensions of the same material. The shorter of these two texts is found in Mass. Hek, 5~8:~ And the throne of glory is high up in the air (171Kl iiiynj Till), and the appear- ance of his Glory is like the appearance of the inWn (~nWnii 17Y2 nll3 7XlDl). And a diadem of brightness (iilll nWY1) is upon his head, and the crown of the explicit name is upon his brow. One half of him is fire (WK) and the other half is hail (112). On his right is life, and on his left is death. And a scepter of fire is in his hand. And the veil is parted in two before him (l739? iiD119 Il31191), and seven angels who were created in the beginning (njnn ?fiTiJtv) minister be- fore him inside the veil (n3n9i1 jn '711)$).~ The language of this text contains several allusions to Ezekiel 1 and has numerous points of contact with the ascent midrash in HZ, §§407-412 where the terms Ynwn (especially) and 7313 are accorded prominence. This text, however, goes further than the ascent midrash, which, though dependent on the lemma Ezek. 1:27 (?~wI? 17y3 KYX!), stops short of describing the figure on the throne. There, the focus of interest is the visionary's passage through the firmaments (i.e., the gates of the sixth and seventh n153??1) as described, according to this exegetical tradition, ' See SCHAFER, Konkordanz, 2.556~.

These observations do not of necessity lead to the conclusion that Mass.

New York of Hekhalot Zutarti and the Sabaoth Enthronement Scene The parallel text to Mass. Hek, 528 is, in fact, preserved as part of a much longer passage in HZ, ms. New York, at SCHAFER, Synapse, $372. SCHAFER appraises this block of material (35368-374) as \"a compilation of various traditions and comments on them,\" and as \"clearly disting- uishable from the other texts [in HZl by a markedly descriptive style.\" He asserts that, in his opinion, the passage is a late addition to HZ, probably attributable to the hasidei ashkenazim, but gives no reason for this evaluation. As will be seen below, there are, in fact, good grounds for assigning it to a much earlier stage of the HZ literary tradition. In the following presentation, it will be convenient to retain SCHAFER'S section numbers, with additional subdivisions (a-b) in three cases.6 SCHAFER, The Htdden and Manfist God, 64. * SCHAFER, \"Aufbau und redaktionellen Ident~tat der Hekhalot Zutartz,\" HS, 57.

As observed by HALPERIN, the material in 0% World, $33 has parallels in several hekhalot sourc- e~.~~ The association of life and death, or good and evil, with the left and right sides of the figure on the throne is a widespread motif in both Jewish and Gnostic sources.27 With regard to this point, however, the two Gnostic texts are significantly different from each other. In 0% World, $36, the central posit-ion is occupied by Sophia, while Sabaoth and Yaldabaoth (\"the prime parent\"), as the representatives of good and evil, stand to her right and left respectively. This arrangement is entirely in accord with the form of Gnostic dualism that this author espouses. In Hyp. Ah, $29, however, Sabaoth himself is in the center, with Zoe on his right and the angel of wrath on his left. This picture is much closer to the model encountered in Mass. Hek, $28 and HZ(N), $372.

THE FACES OF THE CHARIOT 179 This detail is intelligible only in a monotheistic scheme which has the Lord Sabaoth at its center, the life he grants and the punishment he inflicts on either side of him .... Gruenwald seems to be right in inferring, not that the Jewish sources are in some way Gnostic, but that certain Gnostics were familiar with merkabub lore.2a On the other hand, however, HALPERIN discerns a trace of influence in the opposite direction - from Gnosticism to Judaism - in the name K111;1, which is assigned to one of the two angels of punishment to the left of the throne in HZ(N), $372.29 It is probable (though not quite certain) that this name should be vocalized Kll1?l, \"the creator,\" as HALPERIN suggests, and he may be right to associate this name with the evil demiurge of the left in 0%. World, 936 and other Gnostic sources. In HZ(N), $372, however, the two severe angels on the left are not said to be evil, but merely responsible for punishment, corresponding to the angel of wrath in Hyp. Arch., 529. Alignment of the creative aspect of the Deity with the attribute of judgement - if that is what the name K1117 indicates - is arguably, by rabbinic Jewish standards, rather un- conventional, but it is not necessarily evidence of the influence on this text of full-blown Gnosticism. In connection with this question, it is noteworthy that, in the same passage, one of the three outer angels on the left is called 'IKY~w. This name is undoubtedly based on the verbal root YBtV and therefore means \"divine hearing\" or, perhaps more likely, \"divine renown.\" If, however, the initial letter were to be given a hard vocalization (W), this name, al- though meaningless in Hebrew, would be the phonetic equivalent of Capaah. This, as we have seen, is a name of Yaldabaoth in On'g. World, Hyp. Arch., and other Gnostic texts. The Gnostic writers, however, ex- plain this name on the basis of the Hebrew/Aramaic root KBD, \"to be blind,\" and it is therefore entirely possible that it has no connection with the name 'l~ynw in HZ(N), fj372.30 It is also possible, however, that the similarity between the two names is not merely coincidental, in 28 HALPERIN, Faw, 5 14-5 15. l9 Ibrd., 516-517. See pp. 142 and 155 above. The name hmtI IS, In fact, wldely encountered in Jewlsh sources as a name of Satan or \"the Prince of the Accusers,\" who 1s the patron angel of Rome.

These points of contact between the Gnostic accounts of the enthr- onement of Sabaoth and HZ(N), $5368-374 provide clear evidence that they are derived from a common literary tradition. Considered individ- ually, they do not necessarily establish a direct or close textual relation- ship between the Gnostic and Jewish sources.

Ad., 529 refers to the throne of Sabaoth as a \"chariot of cherub im\" (&ppa XEPOUP~V). AS observed by HAL PER IN,^' this expression is probably derived from LXX 1 Chr. 28:18: 706 &ppa.to~ T&V x~p- ovp~v, and/or the Greek recension of Ecclus. 49:8:33 31 See p. 164 above. 32 HALPERIN, paces, 514, n. 5. 33 In ZIEGLER, ed., Septuagmta, vol. 12.2, Saprentta Iesu Frbt Srrucb (Gottingen: Van- denhoeck & Ruprecht, 1965) 355; and see further p. 185, n. 51 below. THE FACES OF THE CHARIOT 181 It was Ezekiel who saw the vision of the Glory, which was shown to him upon a chariot of cherubim. 0%. World, $32, however, understands \"Cherubin\" to be the name of the throne-chariot itself. This is probably due to a misunderstanding of Ecclus. 499 (reading: \"a chariot, Cher~bin\");~ either directly or by way of Hyp. Arch., 929 or another intermediate source. This idiosyncrat- ic expression may also, however, be related to the equally unusual state- ment in HZ(N), 55368-371 that the four nl'n do not merely carry the throne but are actually its legs.'' As has frequently been observed, the author of 0% World, $32 appears to have miscalculated the number of the \"forms\" (pop+fl) of the cherubim, since eight multiplied by four equals only thirty-two forms, not sixty-four as stated. BOHLIG offers the explanation that each of the thirty-two forms are considered to be both male and female:6 but this is nowhere supported by the text itself, and GRUENWALD is certainly correct to associate this detail with Jewish sources like the above, in which the numbers of the wings and/or faces of the n17n are multiplied.37 The fact is, however, that these sources themselves offer a confusing variety of calculations. In the targum to Ezekiel, the wings and faces of the ni7n are enumerated as follows: Andfour facesjir each one (Kln4 l>t)H ilYllX1): each one had four faces, and each single one of the four faces had four faces - sixteen faces for each creature; the number of the faces of the four creatures was thus sixty-four faces. Andfour w~ngsfor each one (Klni 7'911, ilYllK1): four wlngs for each single one - s~xteen wings for each of the faces, s~xty-four wings for each creature; the number of the wings of the four creatures was (thus) two hundred and fifty-six wings.'8 34 The Greek form: XEPOU~~LV does not, of course, decline. 35 A few texts, admittedly, state that the nrn are \"fixed\" (Ylli7) to the throne. See, e.g., PdRE, 94; EfR 26.5 (SCHAFER, Synopse, $273 = HR 27.2-5 in WER'THEIMER, 'I72 n)w77n, 1.109-110). 36 See BOHLIG'S commentary in idem and PAHOR LABIB, eds., Die koptischgnostische Schriifi ohnc Tittd aus Coda II von Nag Hammadi in koptischen Museum zu Alt-Kairo (DAWBIO 58; Berlin: Alcademie-Verlag, 1962) 52.

And four wings each, and four wings to each wing, and four wings to each of these wings - stxty-four wtngs for each I indtvldual il'n. t If HALPERIN is right, as he almost certainly is, then the Aramaic text in HZ, 9354 must have priority over the Hebrew text in HZ(N), $368b.

The first sentence of HZ(N), $370 confirms this calculation and relates it to the statement in Ezek. 1:11 that \"each of the creatures had two wings, each of which touched the wing of another, while two covered their bodies\" (cf. Isa. 6:2). The natural continuation of HZ(N), $368a, however, appears to be 9369, which knows nothing of a multiplicity of faces. This suggests strongly that 9368b was not originally part of this sequence, and that it has been inserted by the redactor of the compilation at this point, probably on the basis of HZ, 5354. If 5368b is omitted, HZ(N), §$368a-369 seems, in fact, to agree with Rev. 4:7, against any known non-Christian Jewish source in assign- ing one face only to each of the four nl'n. Though contradicted by Ezek. 1:6, this is, arguably, a legitimate interpretation of the Hebrew text of Ezek. 1:10, if the verse is considered in isolation: And the likeness of their faces was: the face of a man [in front of the four of them], and the face of a lion on the rlght of the four of them, and the face of an ox on the left of the four of them, and the face of an eagle [behind] the four of them. It seems, however, that the tendency over time of the Jewish tradition was to magnify, rather tha.n diminish, the number of the faces.

The Hebrew text of the calculation of the numbers of faces and wings in HZ(N), 3371b is, as it stands, very problematic. According to SCHAFER'S edition, it reads: The punctuation point after the word D71Dil represents a mark of either one or two dots which has been added by a copyist (of this manuscript or its source) to indicate the point at which, in his opinion, a sentence break occurs.45 The mark is not part of the original text and (as quite frequently in these manuscripts) indicates an attempt by the copyist to resolve a textual diffi~ulty.~~ We are not obliged to accept his opinion, which in this instance appears to be wrong. The crux of the problem is the word TlT, meaning \"pairs of,\" which makes nonsense of the calc- ulation. As SCHAFER rightly indicates, this word is certainly corrupt.47 HALPERIN, who appears to accept the sentence break indicated by the copyist, offers the following rather loose translation: Each leg has four faces of different types, and four wings. The four legs thus have sixteen faces and sixty-four wings in each directi~n.~~ If this rendering were accepted, this calculation would agree with that in the targum.

THE FACES OF THE CHARIOT 185 tion which is not given in this text regarding the mathematical relation- ship between the faces and the wings. Only by reading this text in the light of the targum can we arrive at this understanding of its meaning. The original form of this text can, I suggest, be recovered on the basis of a clue found in a better known but equally puzzling text of the second century BCE. As was observed above, the Greek translation by Ben Sira's grandson of Ecclus. 49:8 reads as follows: It was Ezekiel who saw the vision of the Glory, which was shown to him upon a chariot of cherubim. The Hebrew text of this verse is, however, quite different: Ezekiel saw a vision and declared varieties [?I of chariot?' As can be seen, the word '11 (\"kinds\" or \"varieties\") is graphically very similar to the problematic word 'Jli of HZ(N), 5371b. I therefore pro- pose that the latter text should emended in the light of Ecclus. 499 as follows (with appropriate punctuation of my own): To each leg, four faces; to all the klnds of faces, four wlngs; thus you will find that for the four legs there were stxteen faces and stxty four wlngs, In each direction.

This is contradicted by the words nnK niln at the end of the text, which, if understood to mean \"in each direction,\" produce a grand total of sixty-four faces and two hundred and fifty-six wings, in agreement with the targum. These words, thus understood, are themselves, however, inconsistent with the opening words of the sent- ence: .... tlh? ~IYDxL) KYi3nl (\"and you will find that for the four legs ...,\" etc.). These observations may, perhaps, indicate that the redactor who was responsible for adding 5368b to this compilation also added the words nnK Ill719 to 5371b in an only partially successful attempt to harmonize his sources. An alternative explanation of the apparent anomaly is that the words nnK mln do not, in this text, mean \"in each direction,\" but \"from a single spirit,\" referring to the singular ;iZf3i?. 1177'7 of Ezek. 1:20-21 and meaning, presumably, that all the faces and wings are animated by a single breath or spirit. In either case, our final recon- struction of the calculation in fIZ(N), 5371b is as follows: To each leg, four faces; to all the klnds of faces, four wings; thus you will find that for the four legs there were slxteen faces and slxty-four wlngs. It should be observed that PdRE, 94, although it does not mention the wings, likewise sets the number of the faces at sixteen.'* If this recon- struction of HZ(N), 371b is accepted, we must conclude that three diff- erent calculations of the numbers of the faces and wings of the nizn are encountered in the sources at our disposal. When these three calcula- tions are presented side by side, as on the following page, their increas- ing complexity is readily apparent: THE FACES OF THE CHARIOT Tg. Ezek. 16; Moussaieff Bowl 13-1 1 Each creature has 4 faces. Each creature has 4 x 4 = 16 faces. Total number of faces: 4 x 4 = 16, Total number of faces: 4 x 16 = 64. Each face has 4 wings. Each face has 4 wlngs. Each creature has 4 x 4 = 16 wings. Each creature has 4 x 16 = 64 wings. Total number of wings: 4 x 16 = 64. Total number of wlngs: 4 x 64 = 256. HZ, 9354; HZ(N), 9368b; HR 22:4-5 (99245-246) Each creature has 4 x 4 x 4 = 64 faces. 1 Total number of faces: 4 x 64 = 256. ?. (Total number of eyes: 2 x 256 = 512.) Each creature has 4 x 4 x 4 = 64 wlngs. Total number of wlngs: 4 x 64 = 256. Since HZ(N), §371b, as reconstructed, contains the simplest and most straightforward calculation, there is at least a primafacie case for suppos- ing that this text has preserved the original form of the tradition, and that the arithmetic was expanded over time. In support of this suppos- ition, it may be observed that the reconstructed text of HZ(N), 5371b embodies an intelligible exegesis of Ezek. 1:6, where it is said of the four niq: And four faces to each, and four wlngs to each one of them. The calculation that the four nl'n had a total of sixteen faces and sixty- four wings between them must almost certainly have originated with an expositor who understood the words 03) ntri3> at the end of this verse to refer back to the faces, of which the n1T had four each, rather than to the nl'n themselves. Thus, what he read was, slightly paraphrased, as follows: I Four faces to each one (of the nl'i?), and four wings to each one of those (faces). 5Z See p. 164, n. 38; p. 173, n. 2; and pp. 174-175, n. 6; above; and cf.

In contrast, it is not possible (so far as I can tell) to explain either of the two more com- plex calculations as having been deduced directly from the text of scrip- ture. It is, therefore, safe to conclude that the larger calculations are expanded versions of the smallest one in HZ(N), §371b, which has pres- erved the earliest form of the tradition about the numbers of the faces and wings of the nl'n, albeit in a corrupt form. If, as suggested above, the words n7K nllD were added to HZ(N), 371b by the redactor who also inserted HZ(N), 336813 into the unit: $368a-369, the fact that he felt compelled to expand the totals given in 5371b would imply that $371b was already present, in conjunction with $371a and/or $372, in the source at his disposal. According to our alternative hypothesis, the words nnK nlln originally meant \"from a single spirit\" and referred to Ezekiel's ?;f?i7 Dl?. In this case, it is perhaps possible that the further expansion of the numbers in subsequent texts was based on a misunder- standing of this expression, which was wrongly taken to mean: \"in each direction.\" 4. Ben Sira, the Enthronement ofSabaoth, and Hekhalot Zutarti In the light of these considerations, it would appear that HZ(N), §371b, together with some, at least, of the surrounding material, is derived from an early stage in the development of the 7133)3 tradition. Rather striking confirmation of this conclusion is obtained when the corrupt- ion that has occurred in this text ('IT changed to 711~) is considered in relation to the evidence of two other sources, the approximate dates of which are known. In the first place, the strange miscalculation of Ong. World, 532 can very easily be explained if we suppose that the author of this Gnostic work was attempting to make sense of a Hebrew text, or the Greek trans- lation of a Hebrew text, which, like HZ(N), §371b, read '117 (\"pairs\") instead of 'IT (\"kinds\"). This will have led him to double the numbers of the \"forms,\" making eight at each corner. He has, admittedly, omit- ted the wings, but retained the number sixty-four, which is achieved by the process of doubling again. It seems then, that he has understood his source to say something like the following: For each of the four forms, a pair of forms, and for each one of each of these pairs of forms, four pairs of forms (i.e., 4 x 2 x 4 x 2 = 64). '! THE FACES OF THE CHARIOT 189 The Hebrew text of HZ(N), 5371b and the surviving Coptic translation of Ong. World, $32 are, admittedly, so far distant from each other that it is not possible to reconstruct every step of this process. Nonetheless, it seems probable almost to the point of certainty that the puzzling text in Ong. World, 532 is the direct or indirect outcome of an attempt to resolve the confusion caused by a Hebrew textual mutation of the words D'lo(7) '17 (\"kinds of faces\") into 0'10(n) '11T (\"pairs of faces\"). This being so, the textual corruption observed in HZ(N), 5371b must already have occurred before the time of writing of Ong. World. If the latest possible date is assigned to the Gnostic treatise,\" and if a minimum of time is allowed for the circulation and translation into Greek of the corrupted Hebrew text on which the calculation in 0% World, 932 is based, then the corrupted Hebrew text preserved in HZ(N), 5371b can- not plausibly be dated any later than the mid-third century CE. A more reasonable estimate would place it somewhere in the second century. The original, uncorrupted text must, of course, be older still. A further ~ndication of the priority of this passage in HZ(N) over 0% World, $32 is the statement in the latter text that \"the Cherubin was eight shapes per each of the four comers.\" As we have seen, the word \"corner\" (71'1)) in I-IZ(N), $36813 was originally 739, corresponding to the Aramaic, K9K, \"face\" of HZ, ~354.~~ Once again, therefore, the influence of a textual corruption in the passage preserved by HZ(N) can be detected in Ong. World, 532. Furthermore, we have found that $371b and (j368b were originally independent units which were combined by the redactor of the passage preserved in HZ(N). Since Orig. World, $32 betrays the influence of both units, it is beyond reasonable doubt that the source used by the Gnostic author was this Hebrew passage or a Greek translation thereof. These observations lend further support to our finding that the ori- gins of the HZ literary tradition are at least as old as the second century CE. We have not yet, however, exhausted the potential significance of the textual corruption: 117 to '311 in WN), 5371b. A further implicat- ion of this remarkable happenstance, pointing to a much earlier period of origin, remains to be examined.

The suggestion that these two mistakes can explain not only each other, but also a third confused source, written in a different language before being translated into yet another, would undoubtedly strain the bounds of credibility, were it not for the fact that connections between these three texts can be demonstr- ated on other grounds.56 There is, of course, no evidence to suggest that the corruption in HZ(N), §371b, or the text which existed prior to that corruption, is of the same antiquity as Ecclus. 49:8. Since the wings of the n15n are not mentioned by Ben Sira, we do not know the date at which an anonymous exegete first interpreted Ezek. 1:6 as mean- ing that each of the four faces had four wings. It is, however, clear that the origins of the tradition about the \"varieties of the faces of the char- iot,\" grounded in exegesis of Ezek. 1:6 and 1:10, are at least as ancient as the early second century BCE,\" and that HZ(N), $371b has preserved a very early form of that tradition. By no stretch of the imagination can this text, in its uncorrupted form, be later than the second century CE. It is likely to be considerably older. As we have seen, moreover, HZ(N), $371b appears to be intrinsically connected to some, at least, of the material in which it is embedded, or at least to have been combined with this material at an early stage of redaction of the HZ compilation. This material, therefore, while not necessarily of equal antiquity, is also likely to be derived from the earlier stages of the HZ literary tradition. 56 see pp. 178-181 above. \" MARBOCK (\"Henoch - Adam - der Thronwagen,\" 141-143) potnts out that Ecclus. 49:8 1s a clear lnd~cation that the n31n vlslon was already regarded as the most slgnlficant episode In the book of Ezekiel by the early second century CE."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINE THE STUFF OF HEAVEN 1. The Gag the Levites, and the Waters The theme of priestly purity has surfaced several times in the course of this inquiry. Since the gate of the sixth ?3'i? corresponds to the entr- ance to the sanctuary building, the i113-1~ 771' who passes through this gate is entering territory which is reserved for priests in a state of purity. When he enters the seventh 1377 or divine throne room, corresponding to the holy of holies, he is assuming the supremely privileged role of the high priest. In the water vision episode, the difference between \"worthiness\" and \"unworthiness\" will, therefore, very probably have to do with the issue of eligibility and fitness to perform the priestly office. Considered in the light of this theme, the angels' accusation of the un- worthy 733113 711' in I-IZD.2, \"Perhaps you of the calf-kissers' seed and unworthy to see the king in his beauty,\" is an important key to the meaning of the episode. DAN regards this accusation as further evidence of the \"capricious- ness and cruelty\" of the angels' behavior, since the 7331B 711' can neither know nor be held responsible for the actions of his ancestors at Sinai.' DAN observes that the accusation seems, in fact, to apply equal- ly to all 323113 71117, without exception, since the entire community of Israel was, according to scripture, guilty of this sin.* In REICHMAN'S opinion, the expression $3~ 7j7W113 ?U DYlTn is not meant to be taken literally, since the ii23in 7112 who betrays his unworthiness by asking the question is responsible for his own fate, and ....

THE STUFF OF HEAVEN 193 DEUTSCH interprets the reference to the kissers of the calf as a polemic against heretics and suggests that it may have been specifically directed against the Mandeans, who, like other Gnostic groups, attributed the Sinai revelation to an inferior power and denigrated Moses as the false prophet of the earthly rulers Ruha and Adonaie4 Observing that the Mandeans of the twentieth century linked their own ancestors to the Egyptians and, according to DROVER, held an annual commemorative meal for the Egyptians who drowned in the Red Sea,' DEUTSCH relates these Mandean traditions to numerous rabbinic sources which attribute the creation of the golden calf to the \"mixed multitude\" of Exod. 12:38 (27 my) and Numb. 11:4 (YDDPK;i), and/or to the Egyptians:6 The Jewish tradition portraying the Egyptians or mixed multitude as the makers of the golden calf combined with the Mandaean identification with the Egypt- ians, denigration of the revelation at Sinai, and general hostility to Judaism may have inspired a Jewish polemic which identified the Mandaeans as the mixed multitude who left Egypt with the Israelites and therefore as the makers of the golden calf? This proposed connection between rabbinic traditions and the beliefs and practices of the twentieth century Mandaeans is, as DEUTSCH him- self concedes, highly conjectural.' Moreover, this interpretation of the angels' words of condemnation of the unworthy 223173 7117 is based on the premise that the water vision episode is itself a polemical composi- tion directed against Mandean or other Gnostic cosmological doctrines. That premise is not supported by the results of this inquiry. None of these interpretations, I submit, succeeds in recognizing the real significance of the angels' accusation. Associated with the stories of Moses' ascent into heaven from Mount Sinai and the bodily meta- morphosis that this entailed, is a very widespread midrashic tradition that all the Israelites, when they beheld the appearance of God's mani- fest Glory on the mountain, experienced a similar transformation of DEUTSCH, Cuardzans, 121-122.

According to Pirqei de Rabbi Eliezr, R. Judah says: \"Whenever a man puts on his fine clothes (lnlH9n ?n), he becomes beautiful in his appearance, glory and splendor. Thus were Israel while they were wearing that name - they were as good as angels in the pres- ence the Holy One, blessed be he.\"lo According to a related cycle of traditions, attributed mainly to rabbis of the third century CE, the Israelites were unable to withstand the vision of the divine Glory or the sound of God's voice and so died, but were revived by the angels at God's command. This process involved the transformation of their bodies into fiery angelic forms clothed with the name of God, which conferred immortality upon them until, as a result of the sin of the golden calf, they reverted to ordinary human status.\" Several sources, however, record a tradition that the tribe of Levi did not participate in the sin of the calf and received the gift of priesthood as a reward for its faithfulness.'* The innocence of the Levites is, pres- umably, inferred from Exod. 32:25-29, where the Levites are said to have \"consecrated themselves\" by slaughtering three thousand of their fellow Israelites, at Moses' command, in retribution for the sin of the calf.

THE STUFF OF HEAVEN 199 This Tanhtlma' text is, of course, referring to the narrative of Moses' response to the sin of the calf in Exod. 32:19-22. The enforced drinking of the water on which the ashes of the calf have been scattered is inter- preted in terms of the bitter water ordeal inflicted on a woman suspect- ed of adultery (Numb. 5:11-3 I), with the calf-worshipping community cast in its familiar role as God's unfaithful wife.29 It may be that the puzzling expressions: 0;17?YD2 177niy, and 17n7n2 ?niY in the midrash on Ps. 68:18 originally referred to this test, in which case -2 7nY must in, this context, mean \"to withstand\" or \"to endure.\" If so, the state- ment attributed to Levi in the longer recension, and to Berakiah in the shorter, reads as follows: It was revealed and known to the Holy One, blessed be he, that none of the tribes would withstand their water, but that the tribe of Levi would withstand its water. 2. 7le Waters and the Heavenly Tablets If this hypothesis is correct, the point of the midrash is that the tribe of Levi, unlike the other eleven tribes, was able to pass the bitter water test, thereby demonstrating its collective innocence of the sin of the calf. At first sight, this obscures, rather than clarifies, the relationship be- tween these midrashim and the water vision episode, since, although the image of water is central to both traditions, the motif of drinking water is very different from that of walking on a pavement which looks like water but is really \"brilliant air.\" Nonetheless, the common concern with priestly \"worthiness\" and the theme of guilt/innocence of the sin of the calf both seem to indicate that the two traditions are somehow related. A possible resolution of this difficulty is suggested by the fol- lowing passage of Sefer ha-Z~har'~ At the time when Moses broke the tablets, as it is written: And he shatiered lhem beneath tht mountain (Exod. 32:19), the ocean arose from its place and welled up 29 Compare b.A.2 43b-44a, and Numb.

Then the ocean sank back into its place, In relation to the subject-matter of this inquiry, the Zohar is, admittedly, a very late source.

This particular passage is attached to a discussion of the unquestionably ancient traditional list of ten things which were said to have been created on the eve of the first sabbath of creation.32 HAL- PERIN has shown, moreover, that the golden calf was closely associated with the chaos waters and their assault on creation in the early ii1231D tradition.33 It is, therefore, reasonable to suppose that this text from the Zohar - or, at least, the imagery and ideas that it contains - may be derived from that tradition.

THE STUFF OF HEAVEN 201 the calf were scattered, and which the Israelites were made to drink, are equated with the waters of chaos, while the function of the ;i\"UW 11K, which subdues those waters,34 is symbolically attributed to the tablets of the Law. These, of course, are the first pair of tablets, which were of heavenly origin (Exod. 31:18, 32:15-16) and were broken by Moses as a consequence of the making of the calf. Several sources state that the substance of which these tablets were made was the sapphire of the celes- tial pavement, the earliest of these sources being Sifre Numb., $101:~~ We find that the sapplllre of the (second) tablets belonged to Moses, for lt IS sald: At [/]at tlme, /he LORD sard to me, \"Cut two tablets ofstoneforyourselj lrke the Jirstparr\" (Deut. 10:l). And elsewhere it says: And /he tablets were the work of God (Exod. 32:15), And thry saw the God of Israel an4 under hlsfiet, somelhrng Lke tllcwork ofsapphrre, and lrke the substance of heaven for pun^ (Exod. 24:lO). Thus, there 1s an analogy between the making of the one and the maklng of the other. Just as In the former case it was sapph~re work, so in the latter case it was also sapphire work. Combining the evidence of these sources, we find that the tablets of the Law protect the world by subduing the waters of the ocean (i.e., the \"lower\" chaos waters) and that they are derived from the sapphire pave- ment or firmament, which, as we have seen, forms a parallel barrier between the \"upper\" waters and the celestial throne room. The sin of the calf, which caused the tablets to be broken, released the lower chaos waters from their bounds. Only the Levites, who had not worshipped the calf, were able to withstand these waters when, after they had been mixed with the ashes of the calf, they were given to the Israelites to drink. The sapphire pavement thus provides a connection between the midrashic traditions about the \"bitter water\" ordeal of Exod. 32:19-22 and the water vision episode in HZ. 34 See p. 88, n. 20 above.

It is, in fact, a specific and pointed accusation, since one who is descended from \"the calf-kissers' seed\" cannot be a valid priest. One who mistakes the upper surface of the firmament for water and imputes bodily impurity to the substance of the celestial realm reveals himself as unqualified for the priestly office and, therefore, unfit to enter the temple. Furthermore, since the seed of Levi is uncontaminated by this heinous sin, the Levites are exempt from the penalty that was incurred by the other tribes, namely, loss of angelic status. The accusation: 'You are of the calf-kissers' seed!\" thus also means, by implication: 'You are not, like us, an angel!\" As we have observed, the question which precedes the accusation - \"Do you not see with your eyes!\" - seems to imply that the substance of the pavement does not look like water to the angels.36 If so, the ;1231n 711' who mistakes it for water betrays himself as one who does not possess the pure transformed angelic body of a valid priest, and who is therefore incapable of correctly perceiving the celestial realm.

A question to be considered is whether, in the context of the water vision episode, the notion of priestly status is to be interpreted in literal terms, in which case we are to understand that only a bonafide descend- ant of Levi can undertake the visionary journey through the nli3'7. It is probable to the point of certainty that the ;1231D tradition, with its overwhelmingly cultic imagery, did originate, at least in part, in priestly circles - as, of course, did the Book of Ezekiel itselfS4O Long before the catastrophe of 70 CE, however, the ideal of a \"nation of priests\" had been gathering strength, and groups who had become alienated from the Jerusaiem temple and its cult had begun to develop the doctrine of a spiritual priesthood based on criteria of purity which were independent of physical descent. In the context of Christianity, these ideas are most clearly expressed in the Epistle to the Hebrews, which draws on the Mel- chizedek tradition to articulate a claim to a priesthood which, being conferred by one who is not \"born of woman\" (Heb. 7:3), is untainted by the questionable process of bodily descent, In Revelation, Levitical status in heaven is attributed to the martyrs:\" a category which, in a Jewish context, would include Aqiba. In the Qumran writings, we find that the traditional structure of priestly hierarchy and privilege is allegorized in accordance with the sect's perception of its own situation and self-significance: 39 Ms. Oxford omits 8T. 40 See further, for example, MAIER, worn KuBus, and ELIOR, \"From Earthly Temple to Heavenly Shrines.\" 4' See pp. 131-132 above."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"204 CHAPTER NINE But with the remnant which held fast to the commandments of God he made his covenant with Israel for ever, revealing to them the hidden things in which all Israel had gone astray.

It is also noteworthy that, in the midrashic sources presented on pages 195 and 197-198 above, the tradition of prlestly innocence of the sin of the calf is handed down, in one instance, by a Levi and, in the other, by a Cohen. These considerations do not, how- ever, apply to materials transmitted in the name of Aqiba, who, accord- ing to tradition, came from humble origins.44 It is, moreover, unlikely that, within the broadly rabbinic context of the hekhalot tradition, an insistence on literal, hereditary priesthood would or could have been sustained. The material in HZ:E-F, where the fate of the ;I23?a -illz is determined by his actions, regardless of his actual worth, appears to be incompatible with such a scenario, as, indeed, does Aqiba's warning in babli.

The midrash begins by making a connection between the hands of the Beloved and the heavenly tablets (A1-5), but the basis for this connec- tion is far from clear. Although the biblical account states that the tablets were made by God (Exod. 32:16, quoted in A2) and that he wrote on them with his own finger (Exod. 31:18), the statement that the tablets were his hands makes no apparent sense.s2 The appeal to the word \"gold\" in Ps. 19:11 (A3) provides a link of sorts between the hands of the Beloved and words of Torah in general, but this looks like an attempt to justify the association of Cant. 5:14 with the tablets, which has already been made on other grounds. Similarly, the idea that the tablets were hewn from the sun's golden orb (>l>2) is introduced to explain why Cant. 5:14 applies to them (AS), but it is clearly a conse- quence of that application, not its cause. Joshua b. Nehemiah's state- ment that the tablets were \"rolled up\" (A4), which has no basis in script- ure, likewise assumes the connection between Cant. 5:14 and the tablets as a given. No satisfactory explanation of the real reason for that connection is provided. A clue to this mystery may, however, be disc- erned in Joshua's remark that the tablets were \"of sapphire.\" This is inconsistent with the rest of A1-5, where the tablets are of \"rounded gold,\" as is also implied by Joshua's own prior statement that they were ]~5>11. Since all these attempts to relate the expression 371 to the tablets are clearly secondary, Joshua's passing remark suggests strongly that the original reason for associating them with Cant. 5:14 was, in fact, the word DY173Q at the end of the verse. If so, the basis for the connection, which the redactor of this passage evidently failed to recog- nize, was the tradition that the first tablets were carved from the sapph- ire pavement of the celestial firmament beneath the divine throne. 52 The Image of the Torah as the body of God described In the Song of Songs, though both interesting and important in its own nght, falls outside the scope of this analysis and, in any case, does not explain the specific connection between the hands of the Beloved and the tablets delivered to - and broken by - Moses."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"208 CHAPTER NINE This understanding of the midrash in Cant. R. 5.12 is supported by a passage in Tanbuma':\" X Another interpretation of Cufforyourself[two lablels like thefirsf] (Exod. 30:l; cf. Deut. 10:l): Y R. Levi and R.

The statement in 22 that the tablets were like \"folding panels\" (~'5sh) is an implicit reference to 1 Kgs. 6:34, where the two doors of the sanct- uary buildlng are said to have been constructed each of two leaves, fold- ing (~75751) against each other. Thus, the word n++l In 1 Kgs. 6:34 is cited to explaln how it is that the expression 171 7'79'7~ in Cant. 5:14 appl~es to the tablets. There is, however, no reason to associate the tab lets with the folding doors of the temple except the word t3%'51, which is only relevant because of the previous association between the tablets and Cant. 5:14. The statement in Tanhuma, 22 is, therefore, a secondary explanation of that association, which has already been made on other grounds. As is clearly evident in sections Y and 23, the real reason for that association is the tradition that the second tablets, like the first, were made of sapphlre. Returning to Cant. R. 5.12: in B2, the reason for the proposed con- nection between Cant. 5:14 and Deut. 4:13 is, as in A1-5, completely obscure if this passage is read in isolation.

THE STUFF OF HEAVEN 209 of Torah-talmud as a great sea is applied to the appearance of the writ- ing on the tablets. Since the invisible basis of this passage is the trad- ition that the tablets were taken from the heavenly sapphire pavement, the graphic image in C2 may originally have applied, not only to the tablets, but also - and, perhaps, primarily - to the celestial pavement AS a whole. If so, the tradition attributed by Yohanan to Joshua's nephew will have stated first, that the entire corpus of Torah and talmud was engraved on the sapphlre pavement in patterns of large and small writing, and second, that the appearance of this writing resembled that of waves and ripples on the surface of the sea. The tradition reported by Yohanan may thus, perhaps, provide an important key to the symbolic significance of the water vision episode in EZZ. If the episode were to be read in the light of this tradition, it would appear that, when the m31n 711' looks down at the shining pavement of the heavenly temple, what he sees is not water, but the words of the Torah engraved on the transparent firmament in patterns of large and small writing which look like the waves and ripples of the sea's surface. If this interpretation is valid, the meaning must be that it is Torah, together with israelfs observance thereof, that subdues the chaos waters. Just as, in the Zohar, the writing on the tablets protects the world by keeping the lower waters at bay, so the writing on the firmament preserves the holiness and purity of the heavenly temple by preventing the encroachment of the upper waters. The unworthy 711' Z33113 fails to recognize the true nature of this barrier and imputes to it the very qualities of materiality, impurity and uncontrolled fluidity against which it serves as a protection. By so doing, he demonstrates his own moral and spiritual blindness, as well as his non-possession of angelic status (\"Do you not see with your eyes?\"). The symbolic mean- ing of the episode may, therefore, be that the unworthy ;3131?3 711' has betrayed himself as one who does not meet the criteria of \"worthiness\" according to the rabbinic value system, namely, observance of Torah and mastery of talmud.\" Applying the standard specified in m.Hag. 2.1, he is not a D3tl and is, therefore, unable to understand the vision \"from his knowledge.\" Like the sin of the calf, this fatal misperception threatens to shatter the sacred boundary and to unleash the forces of is Compare HR 20.2-3 on p. 205 above."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"210 CHAPTER NINE chaos and destruction. Protection of the holy place requires expiation of the sacrilege and destruction of the blasphemer. It must be conceded that, given the evident confusion of the tradit- ions recorded in Cant. R. 5:12 and the uncertainty of their dates of origin, this reconstruction of the conceptual basis of the water vision episode, as formulated in HZ, remains somewhat speculative. Moreover, the idea that the waters of chaos are subdued by the words of Torah seems characteristically rabbinic, while the traditions about the heavenly temple, the crystal firmament and the chaos waters are undoubtedly much older. The tradition of exegesis of Ezekiel 1 as an account of the prophet's heavenly ascent has been traced to 1 Enoch 14 and thus to pre- rabbinic On the other hand, however, the idea that the tablets of the Law were of the same substance as the celestial pavement may, perhaps. already be implicit in the unique expression: o~ ht86nhara< in I Enoch 14:10.57 If the above reconstruction is accepted, the idea that the Torah itself is engraved on the firmament, in a pattern which looks like waves and ripples on the surface of water, must be the prod- uct of a relatively late reworking of the traditional materials out of which the water vision episode was composed. It is possible, therefore, that the discussion in Cant. R 5:lZ repres- ents a development in the treatment of these materials which is later than the water vision episode itself. Against this, however, the fact that the real reason for the connection between the tablets and Cant. 514 was apparently unknown to the editors of the midrash points to the possibility that the teaching of Joshua's nephew is a relatively ancient unit of tradition, which may be earlier than, or contemporaneous with, the oldest strata of NZ. An indication that the origin of this tradition may be at least as old as the early second century CE can be found in the vision described in Apoc. Abr. 21:l-29:21, where the biblical account of creation and history is depicted on the firmament? It may also be observed that the teaching of Joshua's nephew might help to account for the fundamental premise of the water vision episode - namely, the duthor's belief that the appearance of Ezekiel's heavenly firmament resembled that of the waves of the sea.59 56 See pp. 105-109 above. 57 See p. 106, 11. 3 above. 58 On the date ofApacalypsr ofAbraham, see p. 109, n. 18 above. 59 However, see p. 212 below. THE STUFF OF HEAVEN 211 5. 7;t/e Celestial Substance In Cant. R. 5:12, the connection between Cant. 5:14 and the image of the sea is provided by a play on the word Itjv?B (C2-3). In scripture, this term occurs both as the name of a precious stone, possibly yellow jasper? and also as the name of a distant sea-port which can only be reached by large, ocean-going vessel^.^' A passage in HR alludes to the latter:62 Like the sound of ocean waters,63 like raging rivers, like the billows of V'Wln when the south wind stirs them up (771 n-11113 n7nlll nllV w7wln 313),64 like the sound6' of the singing of the throne of glory when it extols and praises the wondrous king .... . . In the former sense, the term occurs in Dan. 10:6, where it is used as a simile to describe the appearance of an angel: His body was like v'vln (llj'iij7n3 in;>?), his face like the appearance of light- ning (??? ilK!O7), his eyes like flaming torches (U8 7779'27), his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze (422 niFjn7 YP?), and the sound of his voice like the noise of a multitude (ling 'lii73 17?37 ?i?!). This passage echoes the language of Ezekiel 1 and provides an import- ant exegetical bridge between Ezekiel's vision and the description of the body of the Beloved at Cant. 514. Ezekiel, in fact, uses the word w'@titn to describe the appearance of the heavenly wheels: The appearance of the wheels and then construct~on were like the appearance of v~~in.~~ 60 In addltlon to Cant. 5:14, see Exod. 28:20, 39:13, and Ezek. 28:13. 61 1 Kgs. 2249, Isa. 2:16, 23:1, 23:14, 60:9, Ezek. 27:25, Jonah 1:3, etc. 62 HR 9:l; SCHAFER, Synapse, $162; WERTHEIMER, nIW77D 'nl, 1.85, $10.4.

The dual meaning of uyrUin undoubtedly explains the association between the body of the Beloved and the sea in Cant. R. 5.12, C2-3. As in sections A and B, however, Yohanan's reason for applying the term to the tablets of the Law is concealed beneath the surface of the text. The explanation is provided by the tradition that the tablets were made of the same substance (wywin - lysp - iwn) as other phenomena of the celestial world. This substance is also described in the midrash on 1 Kgs. 19:ll-12 in HZ, fj370,67 which correlates the vision of Elijah with those of Ezek- iel and Daniel, beginning as follows: The nl'n .... fly on the wlnd, for they are entlrely mdde of fire, and the fire 1s lighter than the wlnd, so that the wlnd supports the fire (WNn l;i 13 n112 ni~91yl WE', Y7Va R11;r 135 nllii ID i1'7j7 WE21 ;17'?13), as it 1s sad. Wherever the wznd (m?) would go, ~hrty wzzf .... etc. This statement, which is obviously derived from the tradition about the illnil 017 of Ezek. 1:20-21, as we have encountered it in the ascent midr- ash in HZ, in 1 Enoch 14, and elsewhere, provides rather striking con- firmation of our interpretation of the significance of air and wind in , the ascent-exegetical tradition, and especially of the \"brilliant air\" of the celestial pavement in the water vision episode itself. The scriptural quotation appended to this statement is, strictly speaking, Ezek. 1:12: 7397 n)'?) rill? lW8 >y, but the context indicates that Ezek. 120, with its strange initial preposition: .... n,ij nnj OW-;i7;r7 lW8 ?Y, is probably intended. If translated literally, the verse reads: Upon thaf which the wind was to go, they went, and the wheels rose along with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was In the wheels. 67 See pp. 175-176 above. THE STUFF OF HEAVEN 213 The anomalous preposition ?Y is noteworthy in itself, since it provides further support for the exegesis of Ezek. 1:19-28 as a description of a heavenly ascent. If taken literally and interpreted in the light of the previous verse (0729iKQ WWl: Y34Q j~r) ni)nq KW)?:?), then MI of Ezek. 1:20 may easily be understood to mean that the creatures and the wheels were driven by the wind so that they rose to a point \"upon\" a surface higher than the ground. Immediately after the midrash on Elijah's vision, the following passage in HZ(N), §371a, draws together several strands of the ascent- midrashic traditi~n:~' .... and the likeness of the throne is the likeness of the firmament; and the firmament is like the waters of the sea; and the waters of the sea are like the color blue; and the color blue is ~ap~h;re.\"~ And around the throne are pure thunder clouds, which give forth lightning flashes like jewels of W7W?n. And the brilliance of the flashing of the throne, which is like sapphire with jewels of wlwln, is fhe brightness. As the likeness of them both, sapphire and V'Wln, thus is the likeness of the $awn. It is like the appearance aJJire, but it is not fire. Rather, it is like fiery flames of all kinds of colors mixed together, and the eye cannot master their likenesses. This is a highly summarized, but at the same time very comprehensive, midrash on the inwn 1~3 of Ezek. 1:27, which, it is explained, is the celestial substance of which both the throne and the firmament are made. This substance is also indicated by a variety of scriptural terms and expressions, including: 779D-1)?3, na>& 22'3, WK-il~lD3, and W7W7n. The image of colors mixed together, applied in this passage to the throne and to the firmament, is distinctly reminiscent of the interwoven colors of the temple veils, as described by the chronicler and by Philo and ~ose~hus.'~ The same celestial substance is described, in remark- ably similar terms, in the twelfth of the thirteen Songs 4th Sabbath Sac- ntce from Qumran, which occurs at the climax of the liturgical cycle and concerns the manifestation of the divine Glory on the 8131113 in the holy of holies of the heavenly temple: 68 Cf. p. 176 above. 69 On parallels to the sequence about the color blue in b.Sot. 17a and elsewhere, see HALPERIN, Facer, 217-220. 70 See pp. 158-164 above."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"214 CHAPTER NINE The cherubim fall before him and bless.

The Date of Origin of Hekhalot Zutarti This inquiry has confirmed that Aqiba's words of warning in b.Hag. 14b are, like the story of \"Four Entered Paradise\" itself, derived from the hekhalot tradition. More specifically, the saying is based on a passage which is appended to the water vision episode in the literary collection that came to be known as Hekhalot Zutarti. This passage (HZ:Fl-2') is likewise attributed to Aqiba. It may, perhaps, represent a secondary stage of literary and editorial development of the water vision episode, but it is a logical continuation of the narrative in HZ.' We have seen that the earliest version of \"Four Entered Paradise\" is also preserved in HZ and, secondarily, MR,3 although material from a talmudic source has been interpolated by a later reda~tor.~ Although the motif of dang- er associated with the chaos waters appears to have been a part of the tradition of ascent to the celestial garden or temple from an early per- i~d,~ the 0719 story and the water vision episode are found in discon- nected passages of HZ and seem originally to have been entirely separate literary units. The recensions of \"Four Entered Paradise\" in tos&a, yew- shalmi and Canticles Rabbah, which do not include Aqiba's warning, are adaptations of the original b719 story, as preserved in HZ and MR, sect- ions A and C.6 The redactor who included Aqiba's words of warning in babli was very probably influenced by the stream of literary tradition and editorial activity represented by ms. New York of HZ, in which a reference to the water vision episode has been interjected into \"Four Entered Paradise,\"' and in which a character from the adapted version ' On pp. 57-58 above. * See pp. 80-82 above.

We have found that the passage in I-(Z which includes the water vls- ion episode is composed of a series of \"mystical\" midrashim on Ezek. 1:27 lY3 KlK]) in which the first chapter of Ezekiel is understood to be an account of the prophet's ascent to the dlvine throne.I0 The passage is concerned with the transition from below to above Ezekiel's firmament and has, therefore, been designated \"the ascent midrash.\" In the water vision episode, the firmament is the floor of the sixth 5377, which is the outer sanctuary of the celestial temple. The ascent midrash ends with the admission of the visionary to the seventh 13~7, i.e., the holy of holies, where he is said to see the enthroned king \"in his beauty\" but, in this passage, neither the throne nor the king are actually described. Related materials are encountered in another passage of HZ(N),\" parts of which are reproduced in Mass. Hek., $28 and else- where.

CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS 217 A passage in one Gnostic treatise, Orig. World, 932, reproduces two anomalies in the Hebrew text of the throne midrash as preserved in HZ(N). The Gnostic author must, therefore, have had access to this text, perhaps in Greek trans1ation.l6 One outcome of this inquiry, then, concerns the date of origin of the stream of literary activity which poduced the HZ collection. We have found abundant evidence that some, at least, of the textual units which are preserved in this collection must be at least as old as the second and third centuries CE and, moreover, that the compilation and redaction of those materials must already have been in progress at that time. The earliest strata of HZ are, therefore, older than the \"mystical collection\" which is appended to m.fiag. 2.1 in tosejia, yerushalmi and babli. The beginnings of the HZ literary tradition must, in fact, have been contemporaneous with, or only very slightly later than, the redact- ion of the Mishnah itself. 2. Hekhalot Mysticism and i7331D i7WJJD The findings of this study also have important implications with regard to the meaning of the talmudic expression r113113 ;iWY)3 and its relation- ship to the hekhalot tradition. As is well known, SCHOLEM and his supporters have interpreted the hekhalot writings as the literary products of a living stream of authentic mysticism which was concerned above all with the visionary practice of ascent to hea~en!~ According to this view, the enigmatic allusions in talmudic and midrashic literature to an apparently esoteric tradition associated with Ezekiel 1, 7131)3 ?VYn, are to be understood as references to this tradition of visionary mysticism, the origins of which can be traced to pre-rabbinic times. From this per- spective, the heavenly ascents of apocalyptic literature, the n23tn 2wYn of the talmudic sources, and the visionary mysticism of the hekhalot writings are three successive stages of what was, in essence, the same hist- orical phenomenon. Thus, SCHOLEM postulated .... the essential contlnulty of thought concerning the Merkabah In all ~ts three stages: the anonymous conventicles of the old apocalypt~cs; the Merkabah specu- \" See pp. 188-191 above. l7 See further MORRAY-JONES, \"Paradise Revisited, Part 1,\" 182-185, and the sources cited there."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"218 CHAPTER TEN lation of the Mishnaic teachers who are known to us by name; and the Merkabah mysticism of late and post-Talmudic times, as reflected in the [hekhalot] literature which has come down to us.\" SCHOLEM'S position has been challenged by numerous commentators, beginning with MAIER and UKBACH.'~ These scholars argue that the talmudic expression i113in 7WYn originally referred simply to study and exegesis of Ezekiel 1, not to the actual practice or experience of vision- ary ascents to heaven. According to these commentators, the descript- ions of such practices and experiences in the hekhalot writings were written during a later stage of literary development and may have little, if any, basis in historical reality. The hekhalot texts are thus held to be later than and - in a literary sense only - derivative of the talmudic discussions of ill3ln i1wYn. At the same time, they are distanced from the religious ideology, values, and world view of the \"classical\" rabbinic sources. SCHAFER, commenting on the hekhalot writings, has asserted that .. . we are concerned here with a type ofpseudeprgraphal Itteralure whlch 1s related to Rabbinic l~teiature in a way sim~lar to that by wh~ch the the b~bl~cal pseudepl- grapha are related to the Bible ... it seems quite improbable to me that the goals and ideas propagated In this literature were developed at the same trme as those of Rabbinic Judaism In the form of Mlshnah, Talmud and Mldrash.\" HALPERIN likewise believed the rabbinic concept of 7131n WYD, in sources prior to babli, to be exegetical rather than mystical. He pro- posed the following theory of the historical development of this idea: The mrrkabah exposltlons of Tanna~tlc tlmes d~d not, as far as we can tell, accom- pany an ecstatlc mystlcal practice, nor d:d they conslst of a secret doctrine. They were the public exegeses of Ezekiel's vislon which, I presume, accompanied the recitation of Ezek~el 1 in the synagogue on Shabu'ot ...

Note that, at this stage of hls research, SCHOLEM still asslgned a relatively late date (fifth and sixth centuries) to the redaction of the pnnc~pal helchalot wrltings (rbrd, 44). He later reconsidered thls oplnlon and concluded that \"in many respects, I was not rad~cal enoughp Vmzsh Cnosbcrrm, 8). \" See pp. 24-25, n. 98 above. 20 SCHAFER, \"Aim and Purpose,\" I%, 293 (itahcs his), CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS 2 19 sitions, which they ascribed to the disciples of R. Johanan b. Zakltai .... The ppp- ular enthusiasm, however, was opposed by certain rabbis, who feared potential sinister inferences which might be drawn from Ezelciel's fantastic symbolism, and attempted - with limited success - to suppress the public reading and exposition of the merkabah. When rabbinic restrictions on the merkabah were combined with stories re- counting its wonders .... the impression was created that mac& merkabah was an esoteric doctrine associated with Ezekiel 1, whose numinous dangers demanded that it be kept secret .... If this model is correct, it would follow that the esoteric exegesis of Ezekiel 1, termed ma'deh merkabah ..., was a fiction, however sincerely evolved and believ- ed, of the rabbis?' Even this fictional picture of 7l3in 7WYD -which, HALPERIN believes, was developed in amoraic Palestine - referred only to a supposed tradit- ion of secret exegesis of Ezekiel 1. Although the performance of such exegesis was held to be capable of producing supernatural phenomena, and so to be highly dangerous, it was not, in HALPERIN'S opinion, at first associated with visionary-mystical practices like those described in the hekhalot texts: Only in Babylonia, it would seem, did certain rabbis understand ma'ajeh merkabah to involve an ecstatic praxis as well as (or instead of?) a secret doctrine?' In his subsequent work, HALPERIN suggested that the hekhalot authors belonged to the Ylttil 'nY, a social group about which we know little except that its members were alienated from - and despised by - the rabbinic elite. HALPERIN argues that these writers were envious of the rabbis' power and prestige, which they attempted to appropriate by means of the heavenly ascent and, especiaily, the magical practice of invocation of the nn i~.'~ Although this suggestion has not met with widespread acceptance, HALPERIN'S analysis of the talmudic sources has been widely influential. DAN has, for example, stated: It seems to me that we have to accept, from a historical-philological point of view, the conclusions of Urbach and Halperin, and follow a strict categorical distinction between homiletical, midrashic study of Ezekiel's chariot, known as 2' HALPERIN, I;be Merkabah, 182-183. 22 Ibrd, 183. 23 Idem, Faces, 439446."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"220 CHAPTER TEN ma'arrb mdavab, and the appearance of groups engaged in mystical activity whose ideas are present before us in Hekhalot and Merkabah I~terature.

What 1s reported concerning these specu- lat~ons in the rabbinic sources is actually so restra~ned In matters of content and llterary expression that almost anything can be said wlth equal justification. One can say, wlth Urbach, that what 1s said is, mater~aily speaking, everything that was known; but one can also maintaln that a great deal more than what was said was in fact known Admittedly, ~t 1s quite reasonable to say that the Tanna~t~c specu- lat~ons about the Merkavah d~d not depend on the FZekhalor literature whlch was composed at a later age. But it seems equally reasonable to say that the Tanna~m dld not have to Walt for the Hekhalot literature to dlscover the ecstatic potentlais for the Merkavah mysticism.27 SEGAL makes much the same point, but in a different way and with a greater force of conviction: Because merkabah mysticism is esoteric and the rabbis comment on it only with- in worlts that are fundamentally exegetical in nature, some scholars have maint- ained that there is no mystical content to the stories at all. This is a hasty con- clusion, however, based only on the exegetical hints one finds in talmudic literat- ure. There is no firm evidence of ecstasy or mystical rites among the rabbinic writers because they are eiegetes interested in the legal consequences of those experiences, not the experiences themselves. The first century, like all preceding and succeeding centuries, took experience gained in visions and dreams seriously. 24 DAN, 711ree Tjpes, 4, and see further zdem, TBe Ancient Jmzsh Mysticism, 25-29. \" See p. 25, n. 99 above. 26 GRUENWALD, Apocalyptic, 82. 27 Ibrd., 85. CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS 22 1 It also valued ecstasy or trance as a medium for revelation and developed tech- niques for achieving the ecstasy or trance in which these visions occurred. These beliefs pervaded Jewish culture as well and enriched Jewish spirituality. In the Hellenistic period, these terms become associated with the language of ascension or theurgy, the magic use of shamanic techniques to stimulate out-of-body exper- ience~.~~ SEGAL further argues that the New Testament writings by and about Paul the Apostle provide definite evidence of the currency of such exper- iences and practices in first-century Judai~m'~ a claim confirmed by my own comparison of Paul's heavenly rapture (2 Cor. 121-12) with the \"Four Entered Paradise\" material^.^' Approaching the problem from a phenomenological, as well as historical, perspective, WOLFSON adopts a position diametrically opposed to that advocated by DAN;' and rep- udiates the proposed dichotomy between exegetical and mystical activity: The dichotomy posited by many scholars between exegesis and experience, inter- pretation and revelation, seems to me to be problemat~c. On the contrary, the connection between the process of textual lnterpretatlon (mrdrash) and prophetic states of consciousness or vlslonary experience -what one might call \"inspired exegesis\" or \"pneumat~c interpretat~on\" - 1s found already in Ps. 119.18 and becomes pronounced in apocalyptic texts, the Qumran scrolls, and early Jewish mysticism. Specifically In the case of the Merkabah vislon, the seeing of the throne-world and the glory is to be understood as an interpretative process con- dit~oned by relig~ous traditions and the study of Scripture. The experience does not come to the Jewish mystic ab ovo; it IS shaped and cultivated by a series of cultural-rehgious factors There 1s thus an essential convergence of tradit~on, rev- elation, and interpretation that is characteristic of the visionary experience in apocalyptic and Helthalot Ilterature; these are not d~stinct categories In religious phenomenology To be sure, some of the ancient rabbls ostensibly d~stinguished between those \"who expound the chariot,\" referring to Ezekiel's charlot vision, and those \"who see the chanot,\" thus ~rnpl~ing that exposition does not amount to experr- ence.

The results of this inquiry enable us to find a resolution of this problem. In the first place, it has been almost universally assumed that the hekhalot writings - even if they are believed to contain early source materials - were redacted at a later date than the talmudic documents. This study has called that assumption into question, at least with regard to some significant portions of HZ. These passages, which are descript- ive of the process of the heavenly ascent, are also based on an elaborate exegesis of Ezekiel 1. SCHOLEM'S supporters have, for the most part, maintained that, while the talmudic 7231n nwyn may appear to have been primarily exe- getical in nature, this is not true of the hekhalot writings, which were based on visionary practices and/or experiences. SCHOLEM himself was adamant on this point: These texts are not Midrashim, 1.e. exposltlons of B~bl~cal passages, but a Iiterat- ure sat gmens with a purpose of its own. They are essentially descriptions of a genuine religious experience for which no sanction is sought in the Bible. In short, they belong in one class with the apocrypha and the apocalyptic writings rather than wlth the tradit~onal M~drash.~~ In the light of the results of this inquiry, this statement of SCHOLEM'S is undoubtedly mistaken. Some, at least, of the earliest components of HZ are, in fact, based on a detailed midrashic interpretation of Ezekiel's 33 See pp. 24-26 above and, further, MORRAY-JONES, \"Paradise Revis~ted. Part I,\" 182-185. 34 Scholem, Major Trendr, 46. CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS 223 vision. These elaborate literary compositions certainly cannot be exp- lained as immediate descriptions or \"raw\" products of visionary experi- ence. At the same time, however, our findings have greatly diminished the phenomenological - as well as chronological - distance between hekhalot mysticism and the exegetical 7331n nWYn of the talmudic sources. The ascent-midrashic tradition preserved in passages of HZ is of pre-rabbinic origin, and these passages of HZ have themselves been dated to the early rabbinic period. It is thus more than probable that the talmudic expression 723in nwyn, with its connotations of awesome mystery and extreme danger, referred to the same ancient tradition of interpretation of Ezekiel 1 as an account of the prophet's ascent to the divine throne room in the celestial temple above the firmament. This does not necessarily mean, however, that the tradition to which the talmudic expression i713ln :,;rwYn alludes was \"merelyu exegetical or that it contained no element of authentic mysticism. Such a conclusion would, in fact, be incompatible with the evidence which has been exam- ined in the course of this inquiry. That the ascent midrash in HZ may legitimately be so called is due to its underlying structure and its relat- ionship to the text of Ezekiel 1. The interpretation of that text as a description of the prophet's heavenly ascent, although perhaps initially surprising, falls well within the normal parameters of the midrashic method. The tradition of Moses' ascent to heaven from Mount Sinai, to which HZ itself makes reference:' provides an obvious parallel. The ascent midrash, however, differs from more conventional midrash- im in one very significant respect. Rather than simply describing the heavenly ascent of Ezekiel himself, this text extrapolates from the biblical author's account of his experience the details of a celestial journey which, despite its considerable danger, can also be undertaken by others. The ascent midrash - together with its continuation, the throne midrash - thus goes well beyond ordinary exegesis of its biblical subject. It is an instructional text, concerned with actual performance of the heavenly ascent. The reader is told what he can expect to occur during the heavenly journey, and how he should conduct himself in order to avoid the various dangers that he will encounter. In other words, the ascent midrashic tradition preserved in HZ appears to contain exegetic- 35 See pp. 84-87 above."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"224 CHAPTER TEN ally derived instructions for performance of the celestial ascent by a process of \"active visualization\" or \"guided imagination.\" As we have seen, these instructions include hymns and liturgical formulae, which are evidently intended to be recited at the appropriate moments during the visionary ascent.36 These very early passages of HZ are, therefore, both exegetical and, at the same time, concerned with mystical performance. We have found that these passages are older than the discussion of ;iIIII?;r ;iit'Y?J in the talmudic mystical collection, and that the tradition of mystical exegesis which they represent is even older. There is, therefore, no reason to doubt that the talmudic expression 723713 ?UD~KI refers to this ancient tradition of \"performative exegesis.\" According to this tradition, expos- ition of Ezekiel 1 by one who understands its inner meaning reveals the secret method of the heavenly ascent and, conversely, only a person who knows the details of this visionary practice can disclose the hidden meaning of the biblical text.37 Exegesis and performance thus cannot be separated, since they are two interrelated aspects of the same mystical and esoteric discipline, which the talmudic writers called 23IIlD zwyn. The earliest hekhalot literature appears to have emerged by a process of compilation and redaction of these inherited esoteric traditions. It seems that this process was both parallel and contemporary with that which produced the exoteric talmudic and midrashic collections. This does not necessarily mean that the hekhalot editors belonged to the same social circles as those of the i'classical\" rabbinic texts, or that their religious and ideological outlook was in all respects the same. There is, in fact, evidence of tension between the two traditions and some rabbis seem to have regarded 2331D 2WYD with hostility and suspicion.38 We have also found, however, that the two literary traditions impinged upon and influenced each other from an early period, which indicates that the circles which produced them cannot, in fact, have been very far apart. The complex and reciprocal interaction that we have observed be- tween the two streams of literary activity implies that the social contexts 36 See HZ:F3 and HZ on pp. 58-59; and HZ(N), 5374b on p. 177 above. 37 7711s was, ~n my oplnlon, the onglnai (pre-rabblnlc) meanlng of the expression: lllY7n 0311 2'2 13 DU K?K In m.Hag. 2.1.

CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS 225 in which they occurred must have overlapped or, at least, been quite closely related to each other. 3. Dualism and Priestly Purity Our investigation of the water vision episode in HZ has shown that this literary unit originated in the ascent-exegetical tradition. In this text, which contains multiple allusions to the imagery and language of Ezek- iel 1, the pophet's statement: invn jY3 KT! (Ezek. 1:27) is interpreted as a reference to the vision of the \"pure marble stones\" of the paved floor of the sixth 'l377, \"the brilliance (7111) of the appearance of which (DilVTD) was more terrible (XTl) than water\" (HZ:Dl). This pavement, although it looks like water, is, in fact, the \"brilliant air\" or \"airy brill- iance\" (S1K 1'1/1'T TlK) of Ezekiel's firmament, on which the visionary is standing, and which he therefore perceives from above (ii?!Ji)>~).\" The sixth 5377, where thls vision occurs, is the outer sanctuary of the celestial temple. Access to this sanctuary is controlled by fierce angelic guardians, whose function is to ensure that only one who satisfies cert- ain criteria of \"worthiness\" shall be permitted to enter. These criteria are those of priestly - or quasi-priestly - purity, which in this context means possession of a purified angelic body. According to a related midrashic tradition, such a body was conferred on all the Israelites who received the Torah at Sinai. It would, therefore, be the birthright of each one of their descendants, save for the fact that this glorious gift was forfeited by all those who took part in the worship of the golden calf. Only the tribe of Levi, who refused to participate in this sin, retained their priestly and angelic status. Within the (broadly) rabbinic context of the hekhalot tradition, however, it appears that such status could be regained by one who has achieved exceptional mastery and/or perfect observance of Torah. Such a one will be considered \"worthy\" by the angels. One who mistakes the shining surface of the firmament for water will, however, be recognized as a descendant of the kissers of the calf.40 The reason why the illusion of water is so dangerous is that, accord- ing to the tradition in which this material originated, the substance of 39 See p. 100 above. 40 See pp. 192-205 above."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"226 CHAPTER TEN both the heavenly world and the bodies of its inhabitants is the fiery, luminous material to which scripture refers using several expressions, but especially l'~3.\"' This substance is incompatible with that of the material creation, which was formed out of the primeval waters of chaos. These waters are considered to be intrinsically impure.42 The ordinary physical body therefore carries the taint of this impurity, which is especially associated with the female and with the processes of conception and birth - hence, of course, the recurring objection of the angels to the ascent into heaven of one who is \"born of woman.'*3 The water vision episode thus embodies a dualistic cosmology and a correspondingly dualistic set of moral and social values. Materiality and female status are as essentially opposed to the spiritual and angelic nature as water is opposed to fire. The exegetical and visionary tradit- ion which produced this literary unit must, therefore, have originated in a religious milieu in which such values were espoused. Several strik- ing parallels to the ideas and dualistic values on which the water vision episode is based have been encountered in Gnostic sources, but we have found no evidence of Gnostic influence on the hekhalot writers, who make no allusion to the notion of the evil demiurge or to the Gnostic doctrine of salvation. On the contrary, we have found that the Gnostic writers were indebted to the Jewish sources and traditions which are pre- served in HZ and the other hekhalot collection^.^^ The dualistic perspective of the tradition which produced the water vision episode did not, therefore, originate in Gnosticism but in a much older stream of Jewish tradition, the influence of which can be detected in both Jewish and Christian apocalyptic writings. The dualistic per- spective of this tradition appears to be based on the laws of priestly pur- ity, which are applied on a cosmic scale. The crystal firmament, which is the floor of the celestial sanctuary, functions as a barrier, protecting 4 I See pp. 21 1-214 above. 42 TO this extent, the results of this lnqulry confirm and comblne the explanations of both GOLDBERG and HALPERIN (see pp. 37 and 4244 above). 43 See pp. 96-98 and 119-126 above. 44 See pp. 138-152 and 188-188 above.

CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS 227 the celestial realm of fire and light from contamination by the watery, impure world of wombborn bodily existence. One who aspires to cross this boundary must, therefore, possess the purified body of a true angel- ic priest. The influence of these ideas can be clearly seen in the Book of Re~elation:~ and in passages of the Dead Sea Scrolls.46 According to the ideology embodied in these sources, the requirement of sexual abstinence which applies to priests in the temple must also be observed by those who are destined to participate in the celestial world and there- by to escape the coming destruction of the impure, feminine creation, which is to be delivered back to the waters of chaos out of which it was originally formed. It appears, then, that the tradition which produced the water vision episode must have originated in a form of pre-rabbinic apocalyptic Juda- ism which espoused a radically dualistic vision of the world. This vis- ion was a cosmic projection of the structure of the temple and the laws of priestly purity. The adherents of this apocalyptic form of Judaism regarded the material creation and the womb-born body as intrinsically impure, because contaminated by the substance of the demonic waters out of which they were formed. Consequently, they sought access to the pure celestial world of fire and light, and aspired to membership of the angelic priesthood of that world. In short, this tradition must have originated in a Jewish context very much like that of the Qumran com- munity, whose writings include the earliest known ;1331)3 liturgy, the Songs ofthe Sabbath Sa~nJie,~~ and perhaps also the earliest reference to the tradition of ascent to the garden-temple of Paradise above the chaos waters.48 These observations do not, of course, necessarily justify the conclusion that the origins of the water vision episode can be traced to this particular community of apocalyptic Jews. The ascent tradition associated with Ezekiel 1 has been found in sources other - and, in at least one instance, earlier - than the writings of this group. The extreme dualism of the sect's teachings is undoubtedly but one instance of a more widespread phenomenon.

Characteristic of this dualistic world view is rejection of sexuality and the female body as impure and unholy. This attitude - which is central to the ideology of the Qumran sect - is, as we have seen, based on the concept of priestly purity. To inquire into the primeval origins of these ideas and values would lead us from the sphere of history into that of anthropology or, perhaps, psychology. As HALPERIN has observ- ed, sexual ambivalence and hostility towards the female are dominant themes of the Book of Ezekiel itself.49 It may, therefore, be that these issues played a role in the tradition of ascent to the celestial temple, and the vision of the ;1331n, from the time of its inception. Further research may be required to determine the extent to which the dualistic world view of the tradition behind the water vision episode is characteristic of the hekhalot literature as a whole. The radical dual- ism which is encountered in the writings from Qumran is inseparable from the sect's eschatological beliefs and messianic expectations. Such beliefs were also characteristic of the apocalyptic ascent tradition from which the water vision episode is derived. In this context, dualism and eschatology were two aspects of a single belief system. In the hekhalot literature, however, eschatological teachings are only infrequently encountered. In the centuries following the two catastrophic rebellions against Rome, it is clear that immediate messianic hopes and expectat- ions were repudiated by the leaders of the rabbinic movement. This may, perhaps, be one reason for the hostility of some rabbis towards the exegetical and mystical tradition of the heavenly ascent, which they call- ed ;1331n 2VYn. These observations may also explain why the compil- ers and redactors of the hekhalot literature likewise chose to ignore or to excise this dangerous aspect of the ascent tradition. This being the case, we should not necesarily assume that they espoused - or even fully recognized - the dualistic ideology which was embodied in some, at least, of their sources. On the one hand, it is true that later phases of Jewish mysticism, including the medieval and Lurianic Kabbalah, were strongly dualistic. On the other hand, however, the \"imminent\" eschat- 49 HALPERIN, Seeking Ezekiel.

CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS ology of the apocalyptic ascent tradition is in hekhalot mysticism - as in Christianity, but not in Gnosticism - transformed into a \"realized\" eschatology which, as SCHAPER has observed, does not reject the human world but, rather, posits its redemption: The Merkavah mystic is the chosen one of God to whom messianic qualities are ascribed. .... The redemption does not occur in the world to come, but here and now.\" The priestly role assumed by the ;1231)3 771' who is accounted worthy of admission to the celestial temple can thus be seen to operate within a system of values in which the tendency to dualism may well have been considerably weakened. In this context, the extraordinary purity requir- ed of the ;1331)3 711' is related to his function as a mediator between the celestial and human worlds, which are united in his person. As we have seen, however, the water vision episode is derived from an earlier stage of the ascent tradition in which the material creation and the ordinary human body were considered to be intrinsically impure and, in their essential nature, as opposed to the substance of the heavenly realm as water is to fire. 50 SCHAFER, \"Aim and Purpose,\" HS, 293."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"APPENDIX SOLOMON AND THE QUEEN OF SHEBA 1. ne Legend Cycle of Solomon and the Queen The above inquiry has shown that the symbolism of the water vision epi- sode in HZ is derived from a stream of tradition in which the water of chaos is believed to be the basic substance of carnal existence and mater- iality. Being the expression of cosmic disorder and uncontrolled fluid- ity, such water is demonic and impure. It is opposed to the hierarchical order and purity of the divine realm and is strongly associated with the female. The following study will investigate the origin, tradition-history and meaning of a widely documented story about Solomon's encounter with the Queen of Sheba, which appears to be derived from the same traditional background and to be related in some manner to the water vision episode itself. This story, which is found in both Jewish and Muslim sources, is one of a cycle of tales in which Solomon summons the queen to attend his court and pay homage to him.' Although the different versions of the cycle vary as to detail, almost all involve a contest in which Solo- mon demonstrates his superhuman wisdom by solving a series of riddles and/or tests posed by the queen, these being, of course, the hard questions of the biblical account.'

One of the tests, which is found in both Jewish and Muslim sources, concerns differences of gender. The Queen presents Solomon with a number - varying between six and six thousand - of child slaves, who are all dressed alike and of similar appearance. She then challenges him to distinguish the males from the females without conducting a physical examination. Solomon solves the problem by offering the children food to eat and observing the differ- ences in their behavior. 2. 71;le Glass Palace Tale in Targum Sheni to Esther The story which is of primary interest to us is included in some, but not all, versions of the cycle. One recension occurs in the so-called \"Second Targum\" to the Book of Esther (Targttm Sheni), an expanded and embellished retelling of the biblical story in which it is claimed, amongst other things, that the great throne on which King Ahasuerus (Xerxes) sat (Esth. 12) was none other than the marvelous throne of Sol- om~n,~ which had been taken as plunder from Jerusalem by Nebuchad- nezzar. The text, which is written in Western (Palestinian) ~ramaic; was probably composed or redacted in the seventh century cE, although estimates of its date have varied between the fourth and the fourteenth centuries.' According to Targttm Sheni, Solomon learned of the existence of the Queen of Sheba through a report brought to him by the wild cockerel (KT2 >133in), who describes a land in which \"the very dust is precious, ductzon, Referenm and a shot Cornmenray [New York: Jew~sh Theological Seminary of America, 19901 3-7; trans zdem, 7le Mzdrarh on Proverbs [New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 19921 18-19) and the fifteenthientury Yemenite Mzdrarh ha-Hdez, ed. and trans.

The inhabitants are ignorant of warfare and, most astonishing of all, they are ruled by a woman. On learning all this, Solomon sends the cockerel as his emissary to the queen, bearing a letter in which he commands her to attend his court and pay tribute to him. Should she refuse, he will send his armies of beasts, birds and demons to destroy her kingdom and devour her flesh. The cockerel, escorted by a flock of birds so large that it obscures the sun, arrives in the early morning, just as the queen is going out \"to worship the day.\"' Torn between her rel- uctance to acquiesce to Solomon's demands and her fear of the conse- quences if she does not, the queen sends him a fleet laden with tribute and, three years later, comes herself to Jerusalem. In an incident which is slightly reminiscent of Elisha ben Abuya's encounter with Metatron, the queen, as she approaches King Solomon's court, is met by one of his nobles, Benaiah ben Jehoida; and, deceived by his beautiful appear- ance, mistakes him for King Solomon himself.

It is tempting to pursue this possib ility but, since we have just been told that the queen is performing her act ofworship \"in the early morning\" (~193 713y?), the reading: \"day\" is much more likely to be correct. When the arrival of the birds blocks out the sun, the queen is dismayed and tears her clothes, which makes excellent sense if her worship is addressed to the sun- rise. In the Muslim sources (see pp. 233 and 240 below), she is specifically said to be a worshipper of the sun.

In this version, the primary focus of interest is the queen's glorious throne, which, as observed by HAL PER IN,'^ is designated by the same expression as that used in the same passage to indicate the throne of God, \"the Lord of the Glorious Throne.\" On learning of this throne, Solomon expresses his wish to possess it, and one of his courtiers, who is said to be \"learned in the Book,\" instantaneously delivers it to him by supernatural means.14 Solomon gives thanks to God for having clearly defic~ent.

And when she came to Solomon, she was asked: 'Is your throne lilte this!' And she replied, 'It looks as though it were the same.' I-Ie said: 'Before her, we were endowed with Itnowledge, and before her we surrendered to the Lord. Her false gods have led her astray, for she comes from an unbelieving nation.' She was bidden to enter the palace; and when she saw it she thought it was a pool of water, and bared her legs. But Solomon said: 'It is a palace paved with glass.' 'Lord,' she said, 'I have sinned against my own soul. Now I submit with Solomon to God, Lord of the Universe.\"' Here, the queen's failure to recognize the true nature of the glass pave- ment and her uncertain recognition of her own throne are clearly to be understood as parallel events. Although the precise meaning of the parallel is obscure, it seems that her inaccurate perception is somehow due to her erroneous beliefs. What finally convinces her of her error and persuades her to \"submit\" (i.e., to become a Muslim) is, it appears, her realization that she has been deceived by the illusion of water. As others have observed, this is highly rerninscent of the water vision epis- ode, where the same misperception is understood to be a demonstration of unworthiness to enter the presence of the divine king.16 Moreover, the queen encounters the illusion of water produced by the glass pave- ment only after she has been told to \"enter the palace\" - exactly the same sequence of events as in the ascent rnidrash of the hekhalot tradit- ion. We should also note the way in which the queen's reaction to the king's glass house is described in Targzrm Sheni: \".... she considered in her heart and said ....\" (N!p$] 79'72 K~~u~KI),'~ which may contain an \"Qur'Zn, rbtd, 4144, trans.

Although the Qur'cin does not state that the queen's legs were hairy, the significance of her action of baring her legs is not otherwise explain- ed. It may, therefore, be that the passage is alluding to a story much like that preserved in Targ~m Sheni. This is not, however, certain, since, as HALPERIN rightiy observes, Targzrnz Shmi itself fails to explain why the king chooses to sit in a glass house, or the relevance and meaning of the queen's hairy legs.I8 These considerations indicate that Targum Sheni and theQurJi?n are both alluding to a traditional story which is assumed to be familiar to the reader. Since both these sources were probably written during the seventh century,'9 the story itself must be older still. 4. The Queen's Hazy Legs in Recent Jewish Folklore Two versions of the legend of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba in the oral folk tradition, both obtained from Morroccan informants, are pres- erved in the Israel Folklore Archives. In both, the queen's hairy legs are the subject of one the questions by which she tests the king. The first of these two accounts includes a version of the glass palace tale: King Solomon invited the Queen of Sheba to his palace. The floor of the salon was built of mirrors .... After a receptton party, the queen wanted to test Solom- on's wisdom. She said, \"Everywhere, you have a reputation as a wise man who knows everyth~ng. It's my wish for you to teii me what dlsrlngu~shes my body.\" Klng Solomon smiled and replied, \"You have very hairy legs.\" She sald, \"How do you know; you've never seen my legs!\" Solomon answered her, \"That's why I set the mirrors on the floor.\"20 This version of the story makes it clear that the mirrored floor was con- structed for the specific purpose of enabling Solomon to see the queen's legs. It appears to be implied that Solomon anticipated the question and already suspected the queen of having hairy legs, but we are not told how he obtained this information. This version does not mention l8 HALPERIN, Faces, 488. I9 See p. 231 above. On the date of theQur'r?n, see DAWOOD, \"Introduction\" to The Koran, 1-3. 20 Israel Folklore Archives 1340, trans.

The issue of gender is brought to the fore: She said to him, \"First, what am I like!\" He answered, \"Those legs of yours are like a young man's but your face is that of a giri.\" Her jaw dropped as she expr- essed astonishment. She said to him, \"You won as regards the first question.\"*' 5. 72e Queen? Haiy legs in the Tales of Ben Sira An allusion to the story of the queen's visit to Solomon is found in the Tales of Ben Sira, a bizarre collection of satirical tales and epigrams, also known as Pseudo Ben-Sira or, by the title of one of its parts, as the Alpha- bet ofBen Sira. Several versions of the work are extant, the earliest being dated by ELI YASSIF to the late ninth or early tenth century CE.\" DAN, who attributes the whole text to a single author, states that \"it is impos- sible to fix even the approximate date of the work,\" but that it \"seems - to have been written in the East after the rise of Islam.\"23 This strange but influential text, which does not refer to the queen's questions, the glass palace or the illusion of water, does, however, provide an interesting - albeit anachronistic - perspective on the tale. The mother of King Nebuchadnezzar was, we are given to understand, none other than the Queen of Sheba and, while it is not explicitly stat- ed that Solomon was his father, this is almost certainly implied. The story, which occurs in the context of an equally anachronistic conversa- tion between Nebuchadnezzar and Ben Sira, has been published in three different versions: one in the text edited by M. STEINSCHNEIDER~~ and two in the more recent edition by YASSIF.~~ These three versions are presented for comparison on the following page.

At least one recension, ed. YASSIF (A), leaves the reader in no doubt that the primary cause of the king's revul- sion is her pubic hair. A very similar statement that, during the time of the early monarchy, \"the daughters of Israel had neither under-arm nor pubic hair\" is attributed to Rabba in b.Sanh. 2Izz9 Although the narrative is in all three versions basically the same, there are numerous minor variations of detail and it is very noticeable that, in several instances, the three versions use different vocabulary to say the same thing. This suggests strongly that we are dealing with a popular comic tale which was orally transmitted and widely circulated in the pre-literary traditi~n.~' Although the motif of unwanted body hair is the most obvious and direct connection between the story in the Tales ofBen Sira and that in Targum Sheni, a further link is provided by the role of Nebuchadnezzar, who, according to the targum, captured Solomon's throne and removed it from Jerusalem. The tradition that Nebuchadnezzar was descended from - though not the direct offspring of - Solomon's union with the Queen of Sheba is, in fact, encountered in several Jewish medieval sourc- e~,~' and the significance of this will be discussed below.32 6. De Muslim Commentators As we have seen, the Qur'k tells us that the queen, when she saw the glass floor and mistook it for water, \"bared her legs,\" but does not state that her legs were hairy. In most early Muslim commentaries on the passage, however, this detail is an integral element of the tale. Accord- ing to the historian and commentator al-Tabari (d. 923), the queen - in these sources, called Bilq& - was the daughter of a female jinn, her father being a human king.

SOLOMON AND THE QUEEN OF SHEBA 239 courageous, BilGs inherits her father's kingdom, which she rules in her own right until Solomon learns of her existence.33 A similar account of ~il$s' origin and early life is preserved by al-~ha'labi, an early eleventh-century compiler of traditions from a variety of sources.34 In this version, BilGs' assumption of her father's throne is at first opposed by an evil male rival, who seizes and rapes his subjects' virgin daughters. ~il~Ts agrees to marry him but, on their wedding night, gets him drunk and cuts off his head. The king's former subjects gratefully acknowledge the justice of this act and acclaim her as their queen and ruler. A slightly different and more detailed version of the story is provid- ed by al-Kisi'i (fl. ca 1200 CE), according to whom ~ilGs' father was not himself a king, but the minister of an evil king who, like Bi1y.s' rival in the account of al-~ha'labi, abuses the daughters of his subjects. As in the versions of al-Tabari and al-~ha'labi, ~il$s' mother was a jinn. When Bil$s reaches maturity, she asks her father to let her live in the human world, rather than the realm of the jinn. Her father resp- onds by telling her about the villainous king, who, he fears, will try to ravage her. Bilqk, however, tells him not to be afraid and constructs a magic palace in which to trap the king3' The palace had seven gates, each attended by a daughter of the ]inn as radiant as the rising sun.

Thus, when the king entered, he was showered by coins, causlng him to say to each one of them, \"Are you my beloved?\" At that point, they answered, \"No! I am [only] her servant. You have yet to see her.\" This went on until he finally reached the last of the gates. When BilGs emerged and he saw her striking beauty, he lust about lost hls senses. She set for him a gold table filled with all var~eties of food. \"I have no need of these,\" he said. So she had drinks brought and poured them for hlm; he partook of them and began to moan. Then she offered hlm wine and he fell into a drunken stupor, laylng absolutely motionless on the ground. At that, BII- qis arose and cut off his head. She then turned to her servant girls and ordered 33 For al-Tabari's account of BilGs' early life, see HEKMANN ZOTENBERG, trans., Chronique de Abou DjuJur-Mohammed-ben Djarir-ben-Yesid Tabai traduite sur la version per- sane diAbou Ali Mo'hammed Belhmi d'apr2s les manuscrits de Paris, Gotha, Londres et Canter- bury (4 vols.; 1867; reprinted Paris: ~ditions d'art les heures claires, 1977) 1.443-448. 34 For an English translation of the relevant passage in al-~ha'lab?s XrJ'is al- majc7lis, see LASSNER, Demonizing the Queen, 189-19 l. 35 Al-Kisi'i, al-anbiyr?, trans.

Tie him to a rock lest he surface above the water.\" The servants carried out her commands. Following this event, Bil$s assumes the former king's throne and, as in the other versions, rules the kingdom unchallenged until compelled by Solomon to submit to the overlordship of Allah and himself. The seven-gated magic palace of al-Kisi'i's account is at least slightly reminiscent of the Jewish hekhalot tradition. The motif of mistakenly identifying the guardians of the gates for the one whom they serve may, perhaps, call to mind the figure of Metatron. The king's death by de- capitation is the same fate as befalls the unworthy i7131n 711' in HZ. Considered individually, these parallels are, admittedly, too weak to bear much weight. If, however, they are taken together with the manner in which BilGs orders her servants to dispose of the body, it is not unreas- onable to suspect that the story may contain a distant memory of the water vision episode itself. All three of these commentators include the tale of the bird - as in theQur33n, a hoopooe - who tells Solomon of the queen's existence and delivers the king's summons. ~ilGs, who, as stated in the QurZn, has hitherto been a worshipper of the sun, challenges Solomon's authority - as in Targum Sbeni - by subjecting him to a series of riddles and other tests, all but one of which he is able to solve>6 thereby demon- strating the superiority of his wisdom. This is also demonstrated by the disguised throne and the illusory glass palace, although both seem to be significant in other ways as well. Al-Tha'lab; reports that most author- ities believed that Solomon ordered the throne to be brought to him in advance of BilGs' visit because he wanted it for himself and needed to obtain it while she was still an infidel, since after her submission to Islam, her property would become in~iolate.~' ~l-ThaClab?s account of BilGs' arrival at Solomon's court and the ensuing confrontation is the longest and most detailed of the three.

Al-Kisa'i, who provides the fullest account of ~ilGs' early life, gives only a summary of this part of the ~tory.'~ It will, therefore, be convenient to begin by consid- ering al-Tha'labi's version. Significant variations in the versions of al- Tabari and al-Kisi'i will be discussed below. ~l-~ha'labi states that Solomon disguised the queen's throne and built the glass court in order to test the truth of a malicious rumor about ~il$s which had been started by the satans - a demonic class of jinn - who had their own nefarious reasons for so doing. His account of the ensuing confrontation is as follows:40 A Solomon then said: Disguise her throne for her. That is, add to it and take away from it by substituting the upper and lower parts for one another. We shall see ifshe is truly pided to her throne and recognizes it or is among the ignorant, [meaning] fhose not truIy guided to it (Qur'in xxvii:41). Solomon did this in order to test her intelligence. According to Wahb b. Munabbih, Muhammad b. Ka'b, and other authorities: Solomon was led to this [test of her intelligence] because the satans feared he would marry her and make her desirous of having his offspr- ing. She would then disclose to him the secrets of the jinn, and they would never rid themselves of their subservience to Solomon and his offspring to fol- low. Wishing to incite him against her, they distorted what was praiseworthy [about her], saying, \"There is something [wrong] with her intelligence and her feet are like the hooves of a mule.\" Thus, Solomon wanted to test her intelligence by disguising her throne and wished to examine her feet by building the palace. When ~ilds arrived, [she] was asked: Is [his the likes &our throne? She said: If is as ifit were (Qur'in xxvii:42). Then she compared the [altered] throne to the one she had left behind in a chamber of seven locked gates - she retained the keys. She did not confess that [it was hers] nor did she deny it, whereupon Solomon knew the extent of her intelligence .... 3 .... When she arrived in Solomon's presence, she was fold: Enter the court (Qur'in xxvii:44)! The reason for this was as follows: When Bilqis drew near In search of him, Solomon ordered the satans to build hlm a court ($arb). That was a pal- ace (qasr) of glass resembling white waters in which they placed [real] water stock- ed with fish beneath the [floor]. Following that, he had hls throne placed along 39 See the translation by LASSNER, Demo_nizing the Queen, 212. 40 The following passage from al-Tha'labi, XrZ'is al-majZlis is quoted according to the translation in LASSNER, ibid, 198-200 (paragraph identifiers have been added by me). Where indicated, a small amount of material which is not relevant to this inquiry has been omitted."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"APPENDIX SOLOMON AND THE QUEEN OF SHEBA 243 the central axis fl sudnh). Then he sat, the birds, jinn, and humans arrayed about him. C He ordered the construction of the court because the satans said to one another, \"Whomsoever God has made subservient to Solomon, He has made subservient [according to His wish]. BilGs is the Queen of Sheba. If Solomon marries her, she will give him a son, and [our] servitude [to the prophet] will forever be un- breakable.\" Hence, they wished to incite him against her. And so they said, \"Her feet are like the hooves of a mule and she has hairy all because her mother was a jinni.\" Solomon wished to learn the truth concerning that and to look at her feet and ankles. So he ordered the building of the court. D Wahb b Munabbih related: Solomon built the court only to test her intelligence and understanding ... When Bil& arnved, she was told: Enter the court! When she saw rf, she reckoned 11 to be apool most of which was filled w~th water. And so, she uncovered her ankles (Qur'an mii:44) to wade through the water on her way to Solomon. Solomon gazed at her. Behold! She had the most beautiful ankles and feet that any human could have, but her ankles were most certainly hairy. When Solomon saw that, he turned hls eyes from ~114s and called out to her that rt ts a court made smooth wzth slabs @ass (Qur'zn m11.44) and there [actual- ly] is no water [on the surface]. E When she was seated, she said to him, \"0 Solomon, I wish to ask you some- thing.\" \"Ask,\" he responded. She continued, \"I wish to ask you about [drinking] water which is nelther in the ground nor in the skies.\" Now, when something came up that Solomon did not know, he asked the humans. If they had know- ledge of that, good and well, if not, he would ask the jlnn. If they knew, fine, and if not, he would ask the satans. So he asked the satans about her question, and they said, \"Simple! Order horses to race and then fill the vessels with thelr sweat.\" Solomon replied, \"The sweat of horses.\" \"Correct,\" she sald. F She continued [to probe], \"Tell me about your Lord's [very] being.\" At that, Solomon leapt from his throne, prostrated himself, and lost consciousness. She stood aside as his contingents broke ranks [in pan~c], whereupon Gabriel came to hlm and sald, \"0 Solomon, your Lord is speaking to you. Whatever you want is yours \" The prophet answered, \"0 Gabriel, my Lord knows better ofwhat she said.\" The angel then proclaimed, \"God orders you to return to your throne. Then you will send for her and those of your contingents and hers that were pres- ent [when she asked her question]. Solomon returned to his throne and when they [that is, all who had been present] settled down about him, he inquired of ~ilqk, \"What was it that you asked me about!\" \"About water that 1s neither in the earth nor in the sky,\" she responded. He continued, \"What else did you ask?\" \"I asked nothing else,\" she said. Following that he asked [the same ofj the contingents and they responded as she did, for God, may He be exalted, caused them to forget her query. Thus, God protected Solomon from having to answer. Now, Solomon called upon her to become a Muslim. Yaving witnessed what had happened concerning the hoopoe, the gifts, the messengers, the throne and the court [of glass], she responded affirmatively, saying: My Lord! I have wronged myselfthrough unbelief. I submit through Solomon to Alliih, the Lord of the Universe (Qur'in xxvii:44). The authorities disagree as to what happened to Bilqk after her conversion to Islam. Most report: When Bilqis became a Muslim, Solomon wished to marry her. But, when he mulled over the idea, he became disenchanted; that was be- cause of her thick ankle hair. \"How disgusting this is,\" he said. Then he asked the humans, \"How is [ankle] hair removed!\" \"With a razor,\" they answered. The woman protested, \"No blade has ever touched me.\" So Solomon was against [us- ing] a razor. He said, \"She'll cut her ankle.\" He turned to the jinn, but they responded, \"We don't know [how to remove hair without a razor].\" Finally, he asked the satans, who feigned ignorance and said the same. When pressed by Sol- omon, however, they said, \"We'll employ a technique for you that will make her ankles appear like highly polished silver.\" And so, they prepared her depilatory and bath. Ibn 'Abbis related: That was the first time a depilatory was used. Sol- omon then married her .... .... The authorities [that is, those who believed that the prophet and the queen had wed] reported: Solomon was very much in love with Bilqis when he married her and established her [as ruler] over her dominion. At his command, the jinn built three fortresses in the land of Yemen, the likes of which were never seen as regards height and grandeur .... Following that, he would travel back and forth from Syria to theYemen, visiting her once a month and remaining for three days - that was after he returned her to her domain. Muhammad b. Ishaq reported the following on the authority of some scholars quoting Wahb b. Munabbih: Solomon said to Bilis when she submitted to Islam - his business was done wlth her - \"Choose a man from your own people so that I might marry you off to him.\" She answered, \"0 prophet of God, should the likes of me marry among [mere] men when I have already possessed such authority as I have in my domain and among my people?\" \"Yes,\" he said, \"submiss~on to Islam requires that you do not proh~bit what God has declared as lawful.\" \"If there is no other way,\" she replied, \"marry me off to Tubba' the Elder, King of Hamdin.\" And so, he married them. He returned her to the Yemen and established Dhii Tubba' as ruler there. 41 The word translated \"ankles\" by LASSNER is rendered \"calves\" by HALPERIN (Faus, 488). HALPERIN'S translation may, perhaps, be preferable."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"244 APPENDIX In paragraph A, we learn that the satans are concerned to forestall the possibility of a marriage between Solomon and Bilq;ss, since they fear that the offspring of their union will have even greater power over them than Solomon himself The same statement is made by al-Tat~ari,~' but neither of these two commentators tells us whether Solomon and ~i1q:s did, in fact, produce children. AI-Kisi'i', on the other hand, says no- thing about the satans' fear of such a union, but concludes his version as follows: After that, Solomon married her and she bore him a son, whose name was Reho- boam. The latter's arms reached to his knees, which is a sign of leadership. Wahb continued: ~il$s remained with Solomon for seven years and seven months. Then she died and Solomon buried her beneath the walls of Palmyra, which is in the Land of Syria.43 The statement that Solomon married Bilqys, which is found in all three of these sources, goes beyond the account in Tah ofBen Sira, where he is merely her lover. Moreover, according to al-Kisi'i, she becomes the mother, not of Nebuchadnezzar or his forebear, but of Solomon's legit- imate son and heir.44 Al-Kisi'i does not refer to Rehoboam's reprehen- sible character, or to the Hebrew biblical statement that he incurred the penalty for Solomon's having followed after strange gods, at the instigat- ion of his foreign wive^.^' LASSNER states that these facts were well- known to Muslim scholars and infers that Al-Kisi'i may have intended his readers to understand that Solomon's marriage to BilGs was \"ultim- ately a mistake,'*6 but this is not supported by any evidence in the text The conflicting opinions recorded by al-Tabari and al-~ha'lab: do, however, seem to indicate that the tradition that Solomon and ~iiqb were married was at one time controversial. Ai-Tabari, although he incl- udes Ibn 'Abbis' statement (H), reduces it to a passing reference and 42 Al-Tabari, E-I~stop, 3.582-583 (trans. BRINNER, 71/e Chrldren ofIsrael, 162). 43 Al-Kisa'i, trans.

SOLOMON AND THE QUEEN OF SHEBA 245 reports that Solomon ordered the three fortresses built for Dhii Tubba', ~il$s' new husband (J-K), not for Bilqys herse1t4' The material in E-F is also found in the Histo9 of al-Tabari, who places it between A and B.\" As in the Jewish traditions about the queen's hard queitioni, the meeting is here presented as a contest of wits. According to the rules of the game, Solomon must defend his title - in Islam, Prophet - by answering a series of questions posed by his chal- lenger. Only if he answers them all correctly will the queen acknowl- edge his superiority and submit to him. The first of the two questions in this passage presents him with no problem, since he is able to obtain the answers to such riddles from the satans. The second question is, however, a different matter. Although the exact meaning of the quest- ion is it seems probable that, if the story has a Jewish origin, it originally concerned the mysteries of the divine name.\" It is, at all events, clear that Solomon is unable to answer the question without committing blasphemy. If he fails to answer, however, the queen will have won the contest - hence, the divinely sanctioned intervention of the angel Gabriel, who rescues him from this predicament by miracu- lously erasing all memory of the question. In B-C, al-~ha'lab; tells us that Solomon ordered the construction of the glass palace for the express purpose of testing the truth of the satans' allegations about Bil$s' lower legs. As it turns out, these alleg- ations are only partly true. There is nothing wrong with Bi1y.s' intellig- ence (A) and her feet, far from being like the hooves of a mule, are \"the most beautiful .... that any human could have\" (D). Her only undesir- able feature is the hair on her otherwise lovely lower legs. Close exam- ination of the passage reveals that-Tha'laG has recorded two versions of the satans' malicious rumor (A and C). Both versions include the aileg- ation that her feet are like those of a mule - an allegation which is unique to a1-~ha'iab; - but only the second accuses her of having hairy legs. The first version of the rumor is, therefore, completely false. 47 Al-Tabarl, Hrsto;3r, 3.585 (trans. BRINNER, T2e Chrldren of Israel, 3-164). 48 Al-Tabarl, Hrstov, 3.581-583, trans.

BRINNER, 71/e Chrldren ofIsrael, 161), the queen asks: \"Tell me about the color of the Lord.\" Compare the version in al-Tabari's commentary on theQur'cin (see pp. 246-247 below), where the question is transformed Into a heretical \"utterance\" by the queen."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"246 APPENDIX It is interesting to observe that al-Tha'lab; attributes this first ver- sion to Wahb b. Munabbih, who was a Hebrew scholar, and to Muham- mad b. Ka'b, who was the son of a Jewish convert.\" In paragraph D, Wahb maintains that \"Solomon built the court only to test her intellig- ence and understanding,\" which may, perhaps, indicate that the hairy legs motif was not universally accepted as an authentic component of the story. The motif, admittedly, reappears further down in the same paragraph, but this may simply be due to the way in which al-~ha'labi has combined his sources. Paragraph H includes material similar to that found in Tales ofBen Sira. In G, however, the glass palace incident is included in a list of events which are all understood to be demonstr- ations of the superiority of Solomon's God-given wisdom over that of ~il$s, which comes merely from the jinn. The purpose of these events is simply to convince her of the error of her beliefs, thereby leading her into \"submission\" to the will of Allah. The recension of this material in al-Tabari's His~oty closely resembles that of al-Tha'lab;, with the significant difference that the idea of con- structing the glass palace comes not from Solomon, but from the satans, who know that ~i1y.s has hairy legs and want to trick her into exposing them to Solomon, in the hope that he will find her repulsive.52 The allegation that her feet are like those of a mule is not mentioned. In this version, therefore, ~il$s' hairy legs are an essential component of the tale. In his Commentaty on the QurY;in, however, al-Tabari records a different version of the story, which does not include the hairy legs motigs3 At Solomon's command, the demons built the hall out of glass, as white [that is, clear] as ~f it were water. He ran water beneath ~t, placed his throne [sanr] in it, and sat down upon it. The birds, jinn and humans stood in attendance upon him. Then he said [to the queen], \"Enter the hall\"; for he intended to show her a kingdom stronger than her kingdom, a dominion mightier than her dominion. And when she saw zt she deemed it apool and bared her legs, not doubting that it was water through which she must wade. It was said unto her Enter. It rs a hall made smooth, oJglass. - \" See LASSNER, Demonzztng the Queen, 86. 52 Al-Tabari, Hzstory, 3.583 (trans. BRINNER, The Chzldren oflsrael, 162). 53 Al-Tabari, Commentary on he Qur'in, 19.68, trans. HALPERIN, Faces, 489-490. SOLOMON AND THE QUEEN OF SHEBA 247 When she stood before Solomon, he called her to the worship of God, and condemned her for worshipping the sun instead of God. She then uttered a here- sy [qawi al-zanadiqah]; at which Solomon fell prostrating himself and magnifying [God], on account of what she had said. Everyone prostrated themselves with him. She was at her wits' end when she saw Solomon doing what he did. When \" , Solomon raised his head, he said: \"What was it you said, damn you!\" I ve been made to forget it,\" she said. Then she said: \"My Lord I have wronged myseiJ: and I surrender with Solomon unto Allah, ~hc Lord of rhc Worldc.\" She became a good Muslim. In this version of the story, as in the Qurzn, the queen's action of bar- ing her legs is given no significance beyond that required by the narrat- ive - namely, that it reveals her erroneous perception of the glass floor as being water. The purpose of the glass palace is not to make her rev- eal her hairy legs, which are nowhere mentioned, but - as in section G of al-~ha'labi's versions4 - \"to show her a kingdom stronger than her kingdom, a dominion mightier than her dominion.\" According to this understanding of the narrative purpose and meaning of the glass palace incident, the hairy legs motif would appear to be redundant. In the his to^, al-Tabari describes the palace itself as follows:5s They [the satans] bullt him a castle of green glass, malcing floor tllesi6 of glass that resembled water. They placed wlthin those tiles every kind of sea creature, fish, and the like, then they covered it up. These glass floor tiles are very reminiscent of the transparent (nlili~) paving stones of the sixth palace in the water vision episode in HZ. Al-Kisi'i's version of the glass palace story is relatively short and expands the text of the QurZn as follows:s7 An 'ifr;ti8 called out: \"0 prophet of God! I shall make for you a court of glass. Whoever sees it will think that it contains water stocked with fish.\" Solomon gave permission to have the court built. It had been mentioned to him 54 See the previous page. 55 Al-Tabari, Hrstory, 3.583 (trans. BRINNER, The Chzldren of Israel, 162). \" The Arabic word used here, tawdbrq, 1s apparently unusual; see BRINNER, rbzd., n. 831. Al-Kisi'i, trans. LASSNER, Dcmonrzrng the Queen, 212. A type of jinn."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"248 APPENDIX that ~ilqjs had hairy ankle^.^' When the 'ifrYt had finished, ~ilqis arrived and drew near the court. She saw her throne and was bewildered. [She] war asked. Is ibis the likes oJyour throne? She said: It is ar fit were [etc.] (Qur'an xxvii:42). Following this, she ascertained that it was indeed her throne. When she drew near the court, she reckoned it io be apool [of water]. And so, she uncovered her ankles (Qur'an xxvii:44). Solomon then informed her that if is a court made smooth (with slabs of glass). She said: My Lord, I have wrongtd myseY [with unbelieJ1. I submit through Solomon io AllZh, the Lord of the Universe (Qur'an mii:42). Here, as in al-Tabari's His~oy, the building of the glass palace is pro- posed by a jinn - though not, in this case, a satan. As the text stands, it states that Solomon approved this proposal because - as in the vers- ion of al-Tha'lab; - he had been told that Bilqk had hairy legs and, as LASSNER explains, wanted to know if this was true.6o This information is, however, contained in one short sentence which looks very much as if it may have been inserted into a recension of the story which - like that in al-Tabari's Commentuy and, indeed, the Qar2n itself - did not include the hairy legs motif. In the second part of the text, confirm- ation of the report about Bilqis' legs is conspicuously lacking. 7. 73e Sabjugution of the Hairy Qaeen There are, then, grounds for the suspicion that the strange motif of the queen's hairy legs was not included in the earliest form of the glass pal- ace story or, at least, in the earliest Muslim version thereof. If so, the queen's mistaken perception of the glass floor was simply a demonstra- tion of her status as one who, owing to her erroneous beliefs, is incap- able of seeing truly. Thus understood, the story seems to be closely to the water vision episode in HZ and HR. It is, however, cert- ain that the hairy legs motif was included in the story at an early stage of its literary development, since in Targum Sheni it has already come to define the meaning of the tale. It may be that Solomon has constructed the glass palace for the specific purpose of causing the queen to expose her legs, but, in Targum Sheni, this does not necessarily have to be infer- red. It is, perhaps, conceivable that the bizarre motif of the queen's 59 LASSNER adds the explanatory gloss: [and he wanted to see if it was true]. On the word \"ankles,\" see p. 242, n. 41 above. 60 See the previous note. SOLOMON AND THE QUEEN OF SHEBA 249 hairy legs was simply invented in an attempt to explain the meaning of the glass story, which, divorced from its proper context, was no longer understood. We shall, however, find evidence which indicates strongly that the motif has its own significance, and that it represents an authentic early tradition about the queen. As we have seen, the Muslim writers who mention the queen's hairy legs all attribute this characteristic to the fact that her mother was a jinn. This does not necessarily carry any implication of demonic or evil status, for, in Muslim tradition, there are many varieties of jinn, both good and evil. In the tales of BilG' origins, the jinn realm with which she is associated is described in a way which is devoid of sinister or demonic overtones. Though magical and, therefore, potentially danger- ous, it is also - not unlike the fairy realm of Celtic folkflore - a place of beauty and contentment. Despite her initial resistance of Solomon's summons to \"submit\" (become a Muslim), ~il$s herself is by no means an unsympathetic character. The tales of her defeat of the evil king cast her in a heroic role. On the other hand, her rulership of her kingdom is understood by the commentators to be something which is contrary to the hierarchical order of society as ordained by Allah. According to al-~ha'labi, Ibn Maymiinah related through hls chain of authorltles going back to al-Hasan b. 'AG and then Abii Bakr, who sald: \"I mentioned Bllqls In the presence of God's Messenger [l.e., Muhammad hlmseli] and he remarked, 'No soclety (qawm) prospers that allows a woman to rule over them6' Thus, in these stories, the reason for the moral ambivalence that attach- es to BilGs is that she is an \"unnatural woman.\" She is courageous, intelligent, and skilled in the exercise of power, both political and magical. She is, therefore, highly dangerous and, clearly, very sexy. Her \"manly\" qualities are by no means entirely negative attributes, since they serve to accentuate the great prowess of the king who succeeds in tam- ing her. At first, her independent spirit causes her to challenge Sol- omon's prophetic authority and to refuse to recognize the truth of his religion. She does not, however, seem to be motivated by wickedness. Rather, she is engaged in a spirited defence of her own autonomy. In '' AI-~ha'lab;, trans. LASSNER, Demonrzing the Queen, 190-191 [words in brackets added],"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"APPENDIX the end, of course, she has to be defeated. Having shown herself to be the king's worthy opponent, the \"wild woman\" is compelled to submit to the mastery of Solomon and the rule of Allah, which, once conquer- ed, she does with a good grace. Following her submission, she must give up her authority to Solomon - who may allow her to continue to rule in his name - or, as in the alternative tradition recorded by al- ~ha'lab; (H), to the husband whom he appoints over her. In this context, the meaning of the queen's hairy legs is not difficult to understand. They are symbolic of her wild and untamed \"masculine\" nature, and of her arrogation of the male prerogatives of rulership and power. In a woman, according to these writers, such qualities are repug- nant, no matter how desirable she otherwise may be. Thus, the removal of the queen's hair denotes her submission to the king. This must not be achieved by the use of a razor, which is considered appropriate only for a man. Hence, the king who masters her is credited with having commissioned the satans to invent the first depilatory. The queen's use of a bath and cosmetics to beautify herself serves further to emphasize her acceptance of the properly feminine, alluring and submissive role.62 8. Lilith Many of these observations also apply to Targum Sheni and the Tales of Ben Sira. Although neither source explicitly attributes non-human status to the queen, this has been inferred by most modern commentators,h3 partly on the basis of the Muslim sources, and also because she is very frequently identified, in other Jewish sources, with the demonic figure of Lilith. The traditions about Lilith are complex and many-faceted. At the earliest stage of development represented by the one reference to Lilith in the Hebrew Bible (Isa. 34:14),64 the name appears to be that of \"a female nightdemon haunting desolate Ed~m.\"~' Lilith is mentioned \" For a amilar analysis, see LASSNER, Demonrz~ng~heQueen, 73-87; but see also p. 280 below. \" See further pp. 256-257 below. 64 This passage is discussed on pp. 257-261 below. 65 BDB, 539a.

This aspect of her personality is the subject of many Aramaic and, later, Hebrew protective incantations and amulets, dating from amoraic to recent times.70 In addition to her grim role as the strangler of children, Lilith also appears as a succuba who seduces men during sleep and, by their noct- urnal emissions, becomes the mother of a horde of impure demons. In the literature of the medieval Kabbalah, she is sometimes portrayed as the wife and queen of Samael, the lord of the forces of evil. In this capacity, she is the mother of the impure \"mixed multitude\" that went forth from Egypt (Exod. 12:38)'l - which is to say, a demonic counter- part of the divine Shekhinah, who is the mother of 1srae1.~' Premedieval sources often speak of \"liliths,\" in the plural, who are an entire species of demon.73 Targum Sheni, for example, states twice that God gave Solomon authority over \" .... the demons (1'77w), the spir- its (15nl-i) and the liliths (175~5).\"~~ In the Aramaic incantation bowls ment.

The Lilith of this text is clearly the specific personality encountered in other Jewish sources, while the members of her \"band\" are, presum- ably, the lesser liliths encountered in the bowls and elsewhere. This text also exemplifies the assimilation that seems to have occurred between the Lilith figure and the The Lilith of the medieval and later Kabbalah is a product of the convergence of these traditions with a later myth, which is fully express- ed for the first time in the Tales ofBen Sira.86 Here, Lilith is portrayed as Adam's first wife, who was created before Eve, at the same time as her husband,87 and who refused to accept her divinely ordained status of subordination to Adam, even going so far as to claim the superior position in sexual intercourse. As if this were not bad enough, she then defiantly pronounces the forbidden name of God and flies off into the air. Three angels are sent in pursuit of her and eventually find her hiding in the Red Sea - a body of water which, as shown by HALPERIN, is often symbolic of the chaos water^.^' When confronted by the ang- els, Lilith furiously declares her rejection of the subordinate, nurturing role appropriate to her gender and states that she was created for no other purpose than to kill or injure newborn infants. The three angels, however, decree that their names, whether written or spoken, will have the power to confer protection. 9. Liiith and the Qzeen of Sheba It is evident that the same issues of gender and power as are contained in the Muslim stories about BilGs are also encountered in the Jewish traditions about Lilith, where, however they are raised to a much higher level of moral and emotional intensity. In the figure of Lilith, fear and horror of the \"masculine\" and \"unnatural\" female is increased by several orders of magnitude. Unlike Bilq;s, Lilith refuses to submit and is by nature wholly malevolent and evil. 85 See MONTGOMERY, ibid., 78. Fd. YASSIF 231-234 and 289-290; cf. ed. STEINSCHNEIDER, 23a-b.

LASSNER comments: Some modern readers may wish to see a paradox in this rendering of an ancient tale: Here is the Queen of Sheba usurping phallic power while at the same time she uses water, a symbol of creative female fluid, as a destructive force.90 10. The Queen of Sheba in the Zohar The queen is mentioned in two passages of the Zuhar?' In the first, she appears, not as a demon, but as an evil witch who asks Solomon to tell her how to get hold of a powerful magic serpent which, according to a secret book given to him by the arch-demon Asmodeus, was born from the bones of Baalam?' The second passage, found in the tosaft or hashmatot (\"omissions\") to Zohar, volume 3,93 is a midrash on Deut. 25:9-10, where it is decreed that, if a man refuses to honor the obligat- ion of the levirate marriage, his brother's widow is to remove his sandal and spit in his face, in the presence of the elders. The midrash links this text with 1 Kgs. 10:l (= 2 Chron. 9:l): .... she came to test him with hard questions. In this version of the battle of wits, the queen challenges Solomon to make her a pair of shoes. The king, however, knows that she is a demon and that her feet are, for this reason, not like those of 89 See further: SCHOLEM, \"n757?1 7K?~WK 73771YS 07(0?tl 07i71D,\" 7n, 19 (1948) 166-172; tdem, Kabbalah, 325 and 358-359; and tdem, \"Lilith,\" EJ, 11.248; HAIM Z'EW HIRSCHBERG, \"Queen of Sheba,\" El, 13.1424; SILBERMAN, \"The Queen of Sheba In Judaic Tradition,\" 78-84; YASSIF, Tales, 57-59; LASSNER, DemonzztngtheQueen, 21-35; and the sources clted there. 90 LASSNER, Demonzztng the Queen, 23-24 (ref. to Israel Folklore Archives, 7248). 91 See SCHOLEM, \"07Vln D7;713,\" 168. 92 Zohar, 3.194b.

He therefore \"told her what was in her heartyq or, in other words, that the secret of her demonic identity was known to him. Although the name Lilith is not mentioned in the midrash, the queen's association with the ritual shaming of a man who refuses to perform the levirate marriage may suggest an implicit link with Lilith, who, having rejected the first divine commandment (Gen 1:28), is implacably opposed to human procreation. Whether this be so or not, the mean- ing of the midrash is that a man who refuses to continue his brother's line is to be regarded as the eqivalent of a demon. Of potential relevance to this inquiiy is the fact that, according to the midrash in the Zohar, the queen's non-human feet are a symptom of her demonic identity. The nature of the deformity is, however, different from that described in any extant version of the glass palace tale, being derived from b.Ber, 6a (cited by the Zuhar), where it is stated that the tracks left by demons on the ground are like those of a rooster. Lilith herself is sometimes portrayed on protective amulets as having bird-like claws,95 which may, perhaps, be indicative of her association with the screech-owl.96 These facts, which place her in a different zoo- logical category than al-~ha'1ab;'s allegedly mule-footed ~il<s, do not seem to shed much, if any, light on the queen's hairy legs in the glass palace tale. In both these passages of the Zohar, the queen is, undoubtedly, an evil character. In one instance, she is a witch and in the other, she is a demon, but in neither instance is she explicity identified with Lilith. SCHOLEM, however, observed that, elsewhere in the Zohar, Lilith is ident- ified with the spirit of ii?2DK, croup or diptheria\"' - both respiratory diseases of children and probably indistinguishable at the time of writ- ing of the Zohar - and that it is also said that, when God brings about the destruction of \"wicked Rome,\" he will allow Lilith to settle among 94 nll5 53 nK 75 127, misquoting MT 1 Kgs. 10:2b-3a (= 2 Chron. 9:l-2), which, reads: 7'33~57n~ \"5~ 371~9 ::A~~D!?

This text states that gold cfSheba (Ps. 73:15) is a \"concealed secret of judgement\" given to the Messiah, namely, ii130K, by which he will destroy the inhabitants of Rome.99 On these grounds, SCHOLEM concluded that Moses de Leon was probably the first to identify the Queen of Sheba with Lilith and that he made this identification on the basis of a much older Jewish tradition that the queen was a demon.'OO 11. 73e Problem of the Origin of the DemonicQueen Although no explicit reference to this tradition is found in Targum Sheni or the Tales cfBen S'ira, it has often been inferred. GINZBERG interpret- ed the queen's hairy legs as a sign that she is a demon, partly by refer- ence to the Muslim sources, and partly because of an allegedly wide- spread Jewish belief that the bodies of demons in general are covered with hair.\"' The textual evidence for this belief amongst Jews seems, however, to be rather thin and, in any case, much later than the two sources under considerati~n.'~~ GINZBERG'S interpretation was, none- theless, accepted by SCHOLEM, who stated that the glass palace story in Targum Shenz is \"based on the supposition that this queen was a demon or, at all events, descended from the demon^.\"''^ Most subsequent com- 98 Zohar, 3 19a (referring to Isa 34:14, on wl~ich see pp 257-261 below) 99 Cordovero, Orchard of Pomegranrtes, Gate 6 Coiors, 93 loo SCHOLEM, \"D7iu-m D-J~~Q,\" 166-168. '01 See GINZBERG, Legends, 6 289, n 41. 102 As evldence of the belief that demons as a class have hairy bodies, GINZBERG (zbzd, 192, n. 58) cltes two seventeenth-century sources, 'Emeq haMelekh and Yalqut Hadash (the late twelfth century SeJer Haszdim, also cited by GINZBERG, contains the entirely different statement that male demons have hair on thelr heads, wh~le female demons are bald). GJNZBERG is followed by SILBERMAN (\"The Queen of Sheba ~n Jud- aic Tradition,\" 79), who cites no sources but states that the belief that all demons have hair on their bodies \"is everywhere present, emerging into explicitness in the cabbal- istlc schools of the early Middle Ages and in folklore, particularly of the German Jewlsh communities, in the late Middle Ages and on into the seventeenth and eight- eenth centurtes.\" '03 SCHOLEM, ''D7Wfn D-JPlD,\" 165. SOLOMON AND THE QUEEN OF SHEBA 257 mentators have assumed that this is the correct explanation of the hairy legs motif in both Targum Sheni and the Tales ofBen Siru.lo4 This interpretation has, however, been challenged by YASSIF.\"' He concedes that the beliefs that witches are hairy and that demons have feet which resemble those of ducks or other birds are \"universal folklore ,otifs,\"lo6 but points out that, in both Tarprn Sheni and the Tales of Ben Sira, the significance of the queen's body hair is otherwise explain- ed. in both texts, it is simply said to be repulsive on the grounds of her gender, In YASSIF'S opinion, moreover, the Jewish sources which identify the Queen of Sheba as a demon are all later than these two texts. He concludes that this interpretation of the hairy legs motif orig- inated in the \"Arabic branch\" of the literary tradition!07 12. Lilith and the Haily Demons in Isa. 34:14 YASSIF'S objection to GINZBERG'S weak explanation of the hairy legs motif is clearly justified. The interpretation of the queen's ha~ry legs as a sign that she is a demon may, however, have an earlier and more spec- ific basis in Judaic tradition than YASSIF is prepared to allow. There are several references in the Hebrew Bible to a class of demons called D91yYv, \"hairy ones\" or \"satyrs.\" These demons are said to haunt desol- ate and ruined pl~ces,108 and are mentioned as the recipients of pagan ~acrifices.'~~ The word 1yYy is, of course, also used of an ordinary male goat,\"' which these demons were believed to re~emble.\"~ The '04 See, for exampie, SILBERMAN, \"The Queen of Sheba in JudaicTradition,\" 78-79; and LASSNER, Demonizing fhr Quem, 21-23.

These, however, were slaughtered by Zeus' jealous wife, Hera. Lamia, trans- formed by grief into a hideous and vengeful hag, has since that time gone about the world, like the Jewish Lilith, stealing other mothers' children and carrying them off into the underworld. The name Abpta is related to hapup6c;, meaning \"gluttonous,\" or (of a woman) \"want- on,\"127 and also - which is interesting in the light of Lilith's role as a strangler of children and her association with iT13DK - to 3Latp65, meaning \"throat,\" or \"gullet.\" Under her promiscuous aspect, Lamia is a \"patron-demon\" of prostitutes. The plural form hbpla~ is synonym- ous with \"Epnuoat, and thus more or less equivalent to the Hebrew t)??'? or nl'i'i. Conversely, the singular form \"Epnuoa occurs as the name of a female figure very much like Lamia or, in other contexts, as a name for Hecate herself. In Aristophanes' Frogs (285-295), Empusa appears at the entrance to the underworld in the shifting forms of a cow, a bitch, a beautiful woman, and a mule. In this dramatic epiph- any, one of her feet is made of bronze and the other of dung.Iz8 Although the name Aby~a is found only in Symmachus, an implic- it allusion to these traditions can perhaps be detected in the remarkably specific compound noun 6vo~6vzaupoq (\"ass-centaur\"), which is used in a11 versions of the text to translate 1yq. The word is unique to the Greek text of Isaiah and may well, therefore, have been coined for this purpose.'29 The origin of the mule's feet attributed to ~il$s in the account of al-~ha'labi tan almost certainly be traced to these same trad- itions.

Symmachus, a translator of the second century CE, apparently familiar with rabbinic exegetical tradition^,'^' identifies the Hebrew Lilith with the Greek Lamia, who has mules' feet. ~l-~ha'labi, an Arabic writer of the early eleventh cent- ury, cites eatlier sources with links to Judaism in which mules' feet are attributed to the Queen of Sheba.13' The missing link in the chain is, of course, the association of the Queen of Sheba with Lilith, which must, therefore, have arisen between the second and, at latest, tenth centuries. This finding undermines SCHOLEM'S hypothesis that Moses de Leon was the first to make this association. It also calls into quest- ion YASSIF'S theory that the belief that the queen was a demon had its origin in the Arabic literary tradition. 13. A Problem of Dzfference It is evident that, if the glass palace story is understood in the light of the Jewish traditions about Lilith, it assumes a more sinister significance than is apparent on the surface of the text in either Targtrm Sheni or the Tales ofBen Srra. By baring her hairy and, perhaps, deformed legs and feet, the queen reveals the hideous demonic identity that lurks beneath her seductive outer appearance. Satisfying as this interpretation of the story may be, however, it turns the queen into an irredeemably evil char- acter, very different from the feisty and independent but utimately sub missive ~i1y.s of the Muslim sources. Before we can safely conclude that the traditions about Lilith and her demons do, in fact, lie behind the Jewish versions of the glass palace story, this difference with the Muslim recensions will have to be explained. 14. 73e Queen of Sheba in Christianily It is also necessary to take account of the Christian traditions about the Queen of Sheba, in which she appears as a character even more unlike the Jewish demon queen. On the basis of biblical passages such as Isa. 60:6 -All thosefrom Sheba will come; thg will bring gold and incense; thy 130 See SUZANNE DANIEL, \"Greek: The Septuagint,\" EJ, 4.856, and the sources cited there. \"I See p. 246 above."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"262 APPENDIX wrll procZuim the pram ofthe LORD - the queen is allegorically identified I with the gentile Church, who, like the three magi (Matt. 2:l-12), came from the end of the earth (Matt. 12:42 = Lk. 11:31) to receive the wisdom of Christ, the true Son of David.132 In medieval iconography, she is sometimes depicted with Afr~can features and dark skin,133 reflecting an ancient equation of Sheba with Ethiopia,'34 and also, perhaps, her identification - both literal and allegorical - with the biblical black .... but beaut*l maiden who offers songs of praise and adoration to her Lord and lover (Cant. 1:5).13' What seems to be a transformed version of the glass palace tale is encountered in the legend-cycle of the True Cross, which originated in Byzantium and was brought to Europe during the period of the cru- sade~.~~~ According to this legend, Seth, the son of Adam, procured a sapling from the Garden of Paradise, which grew over Adam's grave to become a mighty tree until Solomon ordered it cut down to be used in the building of the temple. His workmen, however, found that the beam which was cut from this tree was, at different times, too long or too short to be useful. Finally, they threw it across a brook (in some versions, a pond) to be used as a bridge. When the Queen of Sheba came to visit Solomon, she foresaw that this beam would one day be the cross that would bear the savior of the world and, refusing to set foot upon it, chose instead to wade across the brook. In some versions of this story, the queen has a deformed foot, like that of a goose, which is miraculously healed as she passes through the water. This detail may, perhaps, be a vestige of Lilith's bird-like claws - in which case it is 132 See further: CHASTEL, \"La Ikgende,\" part 3, RHR 120 (1940) 163-164; and PAUL F.

'34 As we shall see (p. 264 below), this tradition goes back at least to Josephus. The consensus amongs scholars is, however, that the location of the land of Sheba at the south-western tip of the Arabian peninsula (the Yemen) - whlch 1s where the Muslim writers place it - is more likely to be correct. See further: CHASTEL, \"La ICgende,\" part 1, RHR 119 (1939) 206-225; GUS W. VAN BEEK, \"The Land of Sheba,\" In PRITCHARD, ed. Solomon and Sbeba, 40-63; and the sources clted there.

SOLOMON AND THE QUEEN OF SHEBA 263 another indication that the queen's association with Lilith must be relat- ively early - but, in the context of this legend, no evil significance is attached to it. The high importance of the Queen of Sheba in Ethiopian Christian- ity can hardly be overstated, since it is from her union with Solomon that the royal line of the kings of Ethiopia was descended - a claim which was maintained until the demise of the monarchy in 1974.137 In a remarkable reversal of the Jewish traditions discussed above, it is Solomon who occupies the role of villain and seducer, while the queen, whose name is Makeda, is a pure and noble virgin. After being tricked and then raped by Solomon, Makeda returns to Ethiopia, where she gives birth to a son, Menelik. On reaching adulthood, Menelik visits his father in Jerusalem and is anointed King of Ethiopia by Zadok, the high priest. Menelik and his companions return home, bringing with them the ark of the covenant, which, at God's command, they have ab ducted from the temple. In this way, it is claimed, the divine presence departed from Jerusalem and took up residence in Ethiopia, where the line of David was continued down to very recent times.138 15. The Queen of Sheba in the First to Third Centgries cE When the traditions about the Queen of Sheba in the three great mono- theistic religions are compared, we find that the wholly negative percept- ion of the queen in later Jewish tradition is opposed by the highly posit- ive evaluation of her in Christianity, while the Muslim sources, which present her in a morally ambiguous light, fall somewhere between these two extremes. In the light of these very pronounced differences, it is necessary to investigate the origins of her Jewish identity as Lilith or, in other words, to ask when and why she began to be perceived by Jews as evil and a demon. The answers to these questions may make it possible for us to determine whether or not the belief in her demonic identity - which, thus far, we have found only in medieval or later sources - is the real explanation of her role in the glass palace tale and, especially, her hairy legs. 137 See EDWARD ULLENDORFF, \"The Queen of Sheba in Ethiopian Tradition,\" in PRITCHARD, Solomon and Sheba, 104-106.

Moreover, although the Tales of Ben Sira contains what is probably the earliest surviving account of the myth of Lilith as the evil proro-Eve, the Queen of Sheba is not identified with that figure in this source. On the other hand, the queen's role as the mother of the evil Nebuchadnezzar seems to indicate that her character may not be altogether sweetness and iight. This element is not, however, found in Targum Sheni, or in any Muslim or Christian source, and therefore cannot be assumed to be an early or original component of the tale.'39 Two first-century CE sources which allude to the Queen of Sheba make no mention of her non-human ancestry and appear to regard her in a positive light. In Matt. 12:42 (= Lk. 11:31), Jesus says: The Queen of the South (paothtooa v6zou) wlll be ralsed up at the judgement with thls generation and condemn ~t, for she came from the ends of the earth ($K TQV JIEP~TUV yq<) to llsten to the wisdom of Solomon - and, behold, a greater thlng than Solomon IS here! Even less ambiguously approving is Josephus, whose account of the queen's interaction with Solomon contains no hint of impropriety,'40 and who introduces her as follows: The woman who at that time ruled over Egypt and Ethiopia was thoroughly tralned in philosophy and remarlrable In other ways (oo$tq Glanaxovqttcfvqv rat z&hha 8aupaozfl v).I4' These two sources from the later part of the first century CE indicate strongly that the belief that the queen was a demon was not current at that time, Further evidence in support of this conclusion is provided by the Testament ofsolomon, a Christian text of, at latest, the third cent- ury, which is believed by most commentators to contain materials of first-century Palestinian Jewish origin.142 The work is a collection of tales about Solomon's mastery over the demons, whom he compelled to assist him in the building of the temple. In chapter 19, the king boasts - 139 See pp. 277-279 below. 140 Josephus, Ant., vii1.165-175 (ed. and trans. THACKERAY et al, 7.660-665). 14' Ibrd., 165 (ed. and trans. THACKERAY et a/., 7.660-661).

SOLOMON AND THE QUEEN OF SHEBA 265 that, while he was building the temple, he was honored by visiting kings. Queen Sheba - here considered to be her proper name - is then introduced by the same title as in the New Testament: And among them, Sheba, the Queen of the South, who was an enchantress with great wisdom,'44 came and made obeisance before me.14' This description of the queen as a y6qq may, perhaps, seem somewhat closer to her role as an evil witch in the later Jewish sources. In this context, however, the word does not seem to imply a negative evaluation of her character.146 On the contrary, her magical skills and her great wisdom serve to emphasize the even greater magical prowess and wis- dom of Solomon, whose superiority is acknowledged even by her. Apart from the emphasis on magic, this presentation of the queen is no differ- ent from that offered by Josephus. Despite the fact that this work is primarily concerned with Solomon's dealings with demons, there is no indication that the queen is considered to be such. Elsewhere in the Tat.

DULING (see the previous note): \".... who was a witch, came with great pride ...,\" etc. - a translation of the word &povijo~\\ which, if acceptable, would change the meaning of the whole passage. Admittedly, LSJ (195613) cites two instances of the word with this meaning, both in Euripides. In the overwhelming majority of cases, however, the word means \"thought,\" \"intention,\" \"intelligence,\" \"judgement,\" etc. In post-classical Greek, the meaning of the term seems always to be either \"thought\" or \"understanding,\" \"prudence,\" \"wisdom,\" etc., and I can find no single instance of the word meaning \"pride.\" DULING'S translation is, therefore, most unlikely to be correct.

It is, therefore, safe to assume that the tradition that the queen was a demon was not known to the author of this work. 16. 7Ee Demon Qgeen in theJob Targum The earliest explicit reference to the queen's identity as Lilith is, almost certainly, found in the targum to Job 1:15 - although, unfortunately, the precise date of this text is very hard to determine. The Job targum, which frequently offers multiple alternative translations of a single verse, sometimes written in the margins of the manuscripts, is evidently the product of a rather fluid oral and/or literary tradition, and seems to have been accumulated from a variety of sources over a considerable period of time.'\" Although this process of accumulation may, per- haps, have continued as late as the ninth century CE, several commenta- tors have noted linguistic and conceptual connections with the Pseudep- igrapha, New Testament and other early literature, which seem to indi- cate that the collection may have \"a very early core.\"'49 Within these parameters, the dates of the individual targumim are difficult to ascert- ain. SCHOLEM, defending his theory that Moses de Leon was respons- ible for the identification of the queen with Lilith,I5O baldly states that the targum to Job 1:15 is \"very late,\"'5i but, by all reasonable esti- mates, it is clearly much earlier than the twelfth century.'52 The fact that no alternative translation of Job 1:15 is offered may, in fact, indic- ate that the targum to this verse was established at a relatively early stage in the development of the tradition.Is3 147 See 7Pst.

Rabbi Jonathan and the Qgeen of Sheba An enigmatic remark about the identity of the Queen of Sheba is found in b.B.B. 15b, in the context of an exegetical discussion of the opening verses of Job, which raises the question: When did Job live? One of sev- eral answers to this question is proposed by R. Nathan: Job was in the days of the kingdom of Sheba (K3W n13'7n), as it is said: .... and Sheha Jell (upon them) and took [hem Uob 1 :IS). At the end of this discussion, further down the same page, we read: R. Samuel bar Nahrnani said (that) R. Jonathan said: Whoever says that the Queen of Sheba was a woman IS nothing ~f not mistaken. What does thcQueen of Sheba mean? The Klngdorn of Sheba. R. Jonathan, to whom this saying is attributed, was a Palestinian teacher of the mid-second century CE. Samuel bar Nahmani, by whom Jonath- an's sayings are very frequently transmitted, lived a century or so later, also in Pa1e~tine.l~~ If the attribution to Jonathan is reliable, this state- ment is later than Josephus and the New Testament, but earlier than the Testament ofSolomon. We should note that the first part of the saying 16' BACHER, \"Lilith, Konigln von Srnargad,\" MGWj 19 (1870) 187-189. BACHER, rbrd, 188; followed by SILBERMAN, \"The Queen of Sheba in Judalc Tradition, 67.\" See also JASTROW, Dzctronaly, 405b (YJTD?); BAG, 758b (opBpay6oq); and BDB, 986a (13tp). SOLOMON AND THE QUEEN OF SHEBA 269 - as far as the word i?Ylt3 (\"mistaken\") - is in Hebrew, whereas the second part is, except for words quoted from scripture, in Aramaic. It is, therefore, ~ossible that Jonathan was responsible for only the first part of the saying, and that the words in Aramaic were added by Samuel or a subsequent redactor. In the context of the discussion about Job, Jonathan's statement is rather puzzling, since the words K&j-n3>D do not occur in Job 1:15, which, of course, reads simply: K?W. Most commentators have, there- fore, concluded that Jonathan's statement applies to the account of the Queen's visit to Solomon in 1 Kgs. 10:l-13 (= 2 Chron. 9:l-12). If so, he appears - as the text stands - to be trying to expunge the character of the queen from the biblical record. This exegesis, of course, imposes a considerable strain on the grammar and syntax of the biblical account, in which the pronouns and verbs that refer to the queen are all femin- ine singular, and in which she herself speaks in thk first person singular. SILBERMAN,'~~ following GIN~BERG,'~~ argues that Jonathan's state- ment applies not to the text of 1 Kings, but to Tg. Job 1:15, where the translator has inferred that KJW means ~@-nij~, whereas Jonathan maintains that it means K3t#-n'l1)?~ (or perhaps K?~n>?>n). If this theory were correct, it would confirm the early date of Tg. Job 1:15. Unfortunately, however, it is not at all convincing, since Jonathan is clearly trying to explain a text which includes the expression HJW~~?)?, which is not found in the targum.lb6 It is, therefore, much more probable that he is referring to the story in 1 Kings 10. Confirmation of this can be found in b.Shabb. 56b, which includes the following two sayings: R. Samuel bar Nabrnani said (that) R. Jonathan said: Whoever says that Solomon sinned is nothing if not mistaken (3YlU N~K lIT), as it is said:' .... and his heart was no/ who/& wi~h the LORD his God like the hurt of David, his father (1 Kgs. 11 :4) - it was not like the heart of his father, David, but, even so, he did not commit a sin (HUT1 K? ?n3 KUn?n Ti771 t(57 Klil 173K 717 2352). 163 See GERSHOM BADER, 73r Enyclopcd~a of Talmudic Sages (Northvale, NJ and London: Aronson, 1988) 519-523 and 546-553.

This means that he revoked every judgement that he had made between the ages of eight and eighteen.'68 These two sayings are attributed to the same two authorities as the say- ing in b.B.B. 15b, use exactly the same form of words, and also concern passages in Kings. This indicates strongly that all three of these closely parallel sayings are derived from a single tradition of commentary on that text. If the text of b.B.B. 1% is accepted, in its present form, as a com- ment on 1 Kings 10, it seems that Jonathan's aim is to deny the exist- ence of the Queen of Sheba as a person, and that he is prepared to do considerable violence to the plain meaning of the scriptural text in order to achieve this goal. SCHECHTER explained this radical agenda as .... a protest agarnst some legends, current at the tlme, whlch the Rabbrs consider- ed unworthy of the Solomon ldeallsed by a later generation.

While it is true that the scurrilous legend in the Tales ofBen Sira is probably older than that text itself, no source of comparable antiquity to the saying in b.B.B. 1% betrays the slightest awareness of such a legend.

SAMUEL KRAUSS suggested that Jonathan's statement was a response to the claim of the Christian church to be the true Israel and, especially, the assertion that the royal line of Ethiopia was descended from Solo- mon's union with the Queen of Sheba.\"' By denying the very exist- ence of the queen, Jonathan was attempting to undermine the basis of such claims. A serious obstacle to this argument, as KRAUSS himself conceded, is the fact that, in Jonathan's lifetime, Ethiopia was not yet Christianized. KRAUSS, however, believed that the legend found in the Kcbra Nagast may already have been in circulation at that time.17' This is even more speculative than SCHECHTER'S theory about the story in the Tales of Ben Stra. Even granted the remote possibility that the Ethiopian legend, if it existed at this time, was known to Jonathan, it is hard to imagine that he would have perceived it as a threat of such magnitude as to provoke the drastic response of denying the queen's existence. On the other hand, we have seen that the non-Ethiopian gentile Church used typological exegesis of the story of the Queen of Sheba to support its claim to be the true Israel and, on this point, KRAUSS' theory may, perhaps, have merit. A version of Jonathan's saying about the Queen of Sheba, in this instance attributed to the late third-century amora Yohanan b. Nappaha, is found in Midrash ha-Gadol, a text which, although written by the Yem- enite author David b. Amram Adani in the thirteenth century, is known to contain material of much greater antiquity.17' The saying is includ- ed in a longer midrash on Gen. 25:6, which is attributed to Samuel bar Nahmani:'73 And he sent them away from hu son Isaac. (Gen. 25:6). R. Samuel bar Nahmani said: When our father Abraham saw all these multitudes (1701?3~) and knew that Isaac had no need of them, for they were like weeds,174 he stood up and sent them to the eastern part of the world.

What doesfor the sake of the LORD mean? R. Samuel says:for Ihe sake of the word which Abraham handed down to them, that the Holy One, blessed be he, would in future reveal his kingdom to Israel and make them dwell in safety. When they saw that the king was not the Messiah, then at once she re~urned to her own land (1 Kgs. 10:12), for they returned to their own place. And they are destined to come back in the time of the King Messiah, may it come quickly and in our lifetime, as it is said: A multitude of cameLF will coveryou, the young camels of Midian and Ephah; all [how from Shcba will come (Isa. 60:6). This elegant midrash needs but little explanation. On the basis of Gen. 25:3, the word Sheba is understood to be a collective term for Isaac's subordinate relations, the descendants of Jokshan, who was Abraham's son by his second wife, Keturah. This meaning is then applied to other passages of scripture in which the word occurs, including 1 Kings 10. It will be observed that the whole midrash is attributed to Samuel, with the sole exception of the saying which is here ascribed to Yohanan. Since the connection between Samuel and Jonathan is well established, the name Yohanan should perhaps be emended on the basis of b.B.B. 15b. It might, perhaps, be suggested that this midrash is the source of the saying in b.B.B. 15b. It is certainly consistent with the meaning of the saying as babli uriderstands it. We have, however, found that the 175 Ms. Habesus (Tel Avlv) adds here: \"They say that from the realm of Sheba (KIW nI3?n) to Jerusalem IS a journey of seven years, yet they came to hear Solomon.\" MS. Mahlman (Jerusalem) glves only the first words of 1 Kgs. 10:1 (K2V win?) and omits Yohanan's statement up to this point. See further below. saying is almost certainly derived from a tradition of commentary on the Books of Kings. This midrash on Gen. 25:6 is, therefore, unlikely to be its original home. It might perhaps be argued that the midrash is nonetheless representative of the kind of exegesis that produced the saying, but this explanation does not resolve the problem of Jonathan's motive for trying - as it seems - to expunge the person of the Queen of Sheba from the biblical text. There is nothing in the midrash which would explain why the queen should be regarded in a negative light, and the proposition that all the descendants of Jokshan came to visit Solomon does not, of itself, require that her existence as an individual be denied, since it is clearly stated in 1 Kgs. 102 that she was accompa- nied by a vely great retinue. When the text of the midrash is examined closely, moreover, the saying is found to be somewhat redundant, since we have already been told that \"Sheba means .... the children of Ketur- ah,\" and this collective meaning has been fully developed in the preced- ing narrative. The saying is, in fact, omitted by one sixteenth-century manuscript,'77 which is described by MARGULIES as, in general, \"very ac~urate.\"'~~ This manuscript, which also abbreviates the preceding quotation of 1 Kgs. 10:1, thus reads as They thought he was the King Mess~ah, and so they all came to do him service, as ~t IS written: And IheQueen ofsheha - that in the days of Solomon the whole klngdom of Sheba came to serve Israel, as ~t IS wntten: ..for the sake of the LORD. This text makes it clear that, in 1 Kings 10, n35)3 implies n13h $3 and further elaboration of this point is, therefore, unnecessary. The saying attributed to Yohanan thus looks very much like a (mis-) quotation of b.B.B. 15b or its source, which has been interpolated into the midrash by Adani or a previous redactor. It should, however, be noted that, in addition to the change of attribution, the midrash gives the whole say- ing in Hebrew, unlike babli, where the second half is in Aramaic. 177 See the previous note. 17' MARGULIES, Midrasb hagGadol, 12. i79 AS reconstructed from the apparatus of MARGULIES, ihid., 419."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"274 APPENDIX In short, it is easy to understand why the saying may have been add- ed to the midrash, but the midrash does not provide a sufficient explan- ation of the saying. An alternative explanation remains to be consider- ed. If the Aramaic explanation in b.B.B. 15b is disregarded, the saying is reduced to: Whoever says that the Queen of Sheba was a woman is nothing if not mistaken. It is thus possible to construe Jonathan's saying not as a denial of the queen's existence, but as a statement that she was not a woman, but a demon.180 If this were correct, the saying would be our earliest witness to that belief. Owing to the absence of corroborating evidence, this interpretation of Jonathan's saying is, admittedly, conjectural. It does, however, have the advantage of simplicity and, for this reason, it offers the most economical resolution of the problems that surround the saying. 18. i7e Queen, [he Glass Palace, and her Hairy Legs: A Strruey and Assessment of the Evidence The evidence that has been examined up to this point in our inquiry has raised puzzling questions about the relationships between the vari- ous Jewish, Muslim and Christian traditions about the Queen of Sheba and her encounter with Solomon. The questions of primary importance to us concern the origins and development of (a) the Jewish belief that the queen was a demon, including her identification with Lilith; and (b) the legend that her legs and/or sexual body parts were repulsively and \"unnaturally\" hairy. Our aim has been to investigate the relationships of these two traditional motifs to each other and, above all, their bear- ing on the meaning of the glass palace tale, which is the principal sub ject of this inquiry. In our exploration of the Muslim sources, we found some evidence which indicates that the glass palace story may not originally have incl- uded the hairy legs motif This motif is not found in the QUY'LZ~,'~' or in al-Tabari's commentary on that text, where the purpose of the glass palace is \"to show her a kingdom stronger than her kingdom, a 180 And see further p. 279 below. See pp. 233-235 above. SOLOMON AND THE QUEEN OF SHEBA 275 dominion mightier than her dominion.\"'82 ~l-~ha'labys recension of the tale makes use of sources which either did not include the hairy legs motif or disputed its authenticity.Ig3 In al-Kisa'i's version, the one sentence which alludes to the motif may well have been interpolated into an earlier source in which it was not fo~nd.\"~ The tradition that the queen was the daughter of a jinn is found in all the Muslim sources except the Qur'zn and al-Tabari's Commenta;ly, and this is said to be the reason for her hairy legs. The queen's repulsive leg or body hair occupies a central role in the glass palace tale according to Targtrm Sheni, and in the ribald \"miracle with lime\" episode in the Tales ofBen Szra. In both of these sources, the the significance of the motif is related to issues of gender and erotic aes- thetics. The tradition that the queen was a demon is not mentioned in either text, and YASSIF maintains that it is only encountered in Jewish sources of a later date.18' We have, however, found evidence which indicates that the origins of this tradition are considerably older. The explicit identification of the Queen of Sheba with Lilith in the Job targum is unlikely to be later than the ninth century and may well be much earlier.la6 The signif- icance of the hairy legs motif as an indicator of demonic identity is based on the biblical traditions about the n~l'yw, who, in Isa. 34:14, are closely associated with Lilith. The mule's foot motif in al-Tha'labi's ver- sion of the glass palace tale can very probably be traced to the Greek translations of this same verse and this implies that the queen's assoc- iation with Lilith and the DylyYv was known to his source^.'^' In the Zohar, the queen is a demon and has bird-like claws.188 This passage and the goose-footed queen of medieval Christian legend appear to be derived from a shared source-tradition, which may be as early as the Byzantine period.la9 Taken together, these observations establish a ter- mintrs ante qtrem of about the ninth century for the origin of the queen's 182 See pp. 246-247 above.

The evidence of the New Testament writers and josephus, who por- tray the queen in a wholly positive light, indicates strongly that the belief that she was a demon was not yet current in the first century CE. This terminus post qtrem is supported by the Testament of Solomon, which, although it may be somewhat later, appears to be based on first-century Jewish sources.'90 It is possible, though very far from certain, that the origin of the tradition that the Queen of Sheba was a demon can be traced to Jonath- an's saying that she was not a woman. This saying can be dated, if the attribution is authentic, to the mid-second century CE.I9' If this possibility is set aside, we are left with the rather inexact conclusion that this tradition must have originated within Judaism at some time be- tween the second and, say, the seventh centuries. We must, therefore, ask what happened during this period which might have caused such a radical change in the evaluation of the queen's character to occur. The obvious and most plausible answer to this question is: the rise of the Christian exegetical tradition which claimed the Queen of Sheba as a symbol of the gentile ~hurch.''~ AS KRAUSS observed, this Christian typology may well have been an adaptation of the exegetical tradition represented by Samuel's midrash in MhG, Gen. 25:6.'93 Thus, the demonization of the queen and her transformation into the lecherous and impure Lilith, the bloodthirsty murderer of Jewish women and children, may well have been, at least in part, a Jewish response to the growing power of Christianity and a symptom of the increasing bitter- ness between the two religions. There may even, perhaps, be a veiled analogy between Nebuchadnezzar, in his role as the queen's bastard offspring by Solomon, and the Christian emperors. Another factor in the process may well have been the proliferation of traditions about Solomon's mastery of the demons, as encountered in the Testament ofsolomon, for example.1Y4 As we have observed, the 190 See pp. 264-266 above. 19' See p. 274 above. I9'See pp. 261-263 above. 19' KRAUSS, \"Die Namen,\" 120. 194 See further DULING, \"Introduct~on\" to Teslamen~ofSolornon, OTP, 1.944-951 and the sources cited there. SOLOMON AND THE QUEEN OF SHEBA 277 queen is referred to in that source as a y6q5 - \"enchantress,\" \"sorcer- ess,\" or \"witch\" - and, although the term does not seem to carry negative value in this context,Ig5 it expresses an idea which may very easily be developed in that direction. Against the background of these traditions the riddling match between Solomon and the queen becomes a contest of magical power, and the king's subjugation of her is an extension - or merely a particular example - of his dominion over the demons. The influence of this trajectory can be seen quite clearly in the Muslim traditions about Solomon and ~ilqTs. Here, however, she is presented in a much less negative light than in the Jewish sources. The reason for this may, perhaps, be that the trend towards demonization of the queen was more strongly developed in the context of the Jewish- Christian controversy. It must also be recognized that the Muslim tradition that the queen was descended from the jinn expresses a very different concept than the Jewish belief that she was a demon. As we have seen, the various kinds of jinn differ as to their moral status,'96 whereas, according to Jewish belief, all demons are by definition evil. In all probablility, the demonization of the queen within Judaism, which culiminated in her identification with Lilith, was, as SCHOLEM suggested,'\" a gradual process, beginning with the transition from wise woman (as in Test. Sol. 19:3) to wicked witch (as in Zohar, 3.194b), and thence to the status of demon or lesser lilith (as in Tosefat la-Zohar, 3.308b). As we saw in our discussion of the Aramaic incantation bowls, the figures of the witch and the 13th were closely assimilated with each other.19' The queen as we encounter her in the Tales of Ben Sira appears to be located at an intermediate point along this trajectory. She is certainly not the primeval Lilith, who appears elsewhere in the text. Although we are not specifically told that she is a witch or a demon, this is strongly indicated by the statement that her union with Solomon produced Isra- el's evil nemesis, Nebuchadnezzar. This statement, which embodies a well-documented traditi~n,'~~ can almost certainly be detected beneath the text of Targum Sheni, where the story of Solomon and the queen is 195 See pp. 264-266 above. 196 See p. 249 above. 197 See p. 256 above. I9'See p. 253 above. 199 See p. 238, n. 31 above."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"282 APPENDIX mon later in the story. By the end of the chapter, we have learned who the Queen of Sheba was, why she was good at riddles, and how she came to rule a kingdom in her own right. Although these questions arise from the biblical account, Saadiah's answers to them are derived exclusively from his Muslim sources. The second chapter of the text tells of a war between Solomon and an island king, who has a beautiful daughter, and who worships an idol which is inhabited by a ?W - and in this instance the word evidently means \"demon.\" Solomon sends the king a letter, demanding that he abandon his idolatrous religion and embrace the worship of the one true God, and also that he give his daughter to Solomon as one of his wives. At the instigation of the demon, however, the king has the tem- erity to refuse. Solomon's army of invasion, which consists of humans, animals and birds, is transported to the island by the four winds. After defeating the king, Solomon sends the demons (D'TU) in his service to capture the demon of the idol and hangs him from a beam on which is inscribed the explicit name of God.214 He also hangs the king of the island and makes off with his daughter. This chapter of the text, which contains both Muslim and Jewish elements, thus serves to intra- duce Solomon into the story and to indicate the extraordinary extent of his power. The third and final chapter tells of Solomon's encounter with the Queen of Sheba. As in the Muslim sources, he learns of her existence from the hoopooes (n137317;1),215 who describe her as follows:216 There is a certaln woman whose name is Queen of Sheba, who has ruled over them (the Shebans) stnce the death of her husband. She 1s wlse, gracious, klnd, intelligent, and beautiful In appearance. She judges us with justice and rectitude, and has worked much goodness and righteousness in that land. She has raised usfrom ouryoutb unfrl now (Gen. 46:34). She has been like a mother to us, and we are under obedience to her, not in fear of a king, but because she is klnd to us and we are to her as sons.2\" 214 It is perhaps possibie that thls magic beam is distantly related to the beam of wood from the garden of Paradise which, according to the Christian iegend, was dest- ined to become the True Cross (see p. 262 above). Although the noun is slngular in form, Saadiah treats ~t as a collective, uslng plural verbs throughout. 'I6 Ed. AVIDA, \"~12~ n35)3 ilVYD,\" 10; cf.

The birds then return to the land of Sheba, where they tell the queen all about Solomon. Their report emphasizes, on the one hand, Solomon's mercy and compassion but, on the other, his martial exploits and his terrible treatment of those who refuse to render obedience to him. I-Iearing this, the queen and her subjects are filled with wonder and dismay. Following this, the queen decides to visit Solomon, so that she can experience his wisdom, power and greatness at first hand. On arrival, she presents him with a series of riddles. From this point on, Jewish elements are predominant in the narrative. All of the riddles are found in Jewish sources. All but one, which concerns the incestuous union of Lot and his daughters, have to do with \"feminine\" subjects, including menstruation, pregnancy, lactation, and cosmetics. Saadiah also incl- udes the widely documented gender-recognition test involving male and female slave children.'19 Solomon responds to all these questions with contempt:22\" He said to her: \"With women's matters, about whlch women gossip to each other in the moonlight, you would come to test me!\"2z1 LASSNER tentatively suggests that the reference to the moon (Tll2-5) in this context contains an implicit allusion to a woman's monthly period of impurity, in particular the seven days of wearing white (12-51, and that Solomon may, therefore, have slept with the Queen in the knowledge that she was impure.222 As LASSNER himself admits, however, this interpretation is extremely speculative and has no real basis in the text. There may, perhaps, be a hint of witchcraft in these words, but it is simpler and probably more reasonable to understand them as a straight- forward expression of contempt for women's knowledge and concerns, 218 LASSNER, Demonrzrng the Queen, 13 9-1 40. 219 See p. 231 above.

SOLOMON AND THE QUEEN OF SHEBA 285 &he hand oJKing Solomon, so she turned and wen& back to her own land she and her sewants (1 Kgs. 10:13). It will be observed that Saadiah's version of the glass palace tale (B) appears to have been interpolated into an extensive, slightly paraphrased scriptural quotation (A-C). This scriptural passage is the natural and appropriate conclusion to the preceding account of Solomon's encount- er with the queen and the contest of riddles. In other words, the glass palace tale is not intrinsically related to the text in which it is embedded and appears to be derived from a different source or sources. Saadiah states explicitly that Nebuchadnezzar was descended from Solomon's union with the Queen of Sheba. Although this widespread tradition very probably lies beneath the surface of the text in Targum Shen~,2'~ it is not openly stated in any other version of the glass palace tale. To the best of my knowledge, the only other source to combine the tradition about Nebuchadnezzar's ancestry with that of the queen's hairy legs is the Tales dBen Sira. AVIDA regards the begetting of Nebu- chadnezzar as the climax of Saadiah's tale and remarks that the entire composition would perhaps more accurately be entitled: \"The Genealogy of Nebuchadne~zar.'\"~~ This is clearly an overstatement. Moreover, the queen's role as Nebuchadnezzar's maternal ancestor is hardly consis- tent with her character in the main body of the tale, where she is port- rayed as a paragon of virtue. Rather than trying to impose a spurious unity on the text as a whole, it is more reasonable to infer that Saadiah, who clearly used a variety of sources, both Jewish and Muslim, has incl- uded every tradition known to him about the Queen of Sheba, and that he either did not notice or was not unduly troubled by the inconsist- encies between them. It is also necessary to account for a problem posed by the second part of the opening sentence of unit B, where AVIDA prints: This appears to indicate that, in AVIDA'S opinion, the words in paren- theses should be deleted and those in square brackets added.231 AVIDA 225 See pp. 277-278 above. 230 AWDA, \"XW n3in ilwyn,\" 2-3. 231 Cf. n. 225 above."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"APPENDIX SOLOMON AND THE QUEEN OF SHEBA 287 gives no reason for this editorial correction, but it is true that Saadiah's syntax is at this point rather strained, since the conjunction L/IIX is, in effect, duplicated by the abbreviated expression 13 73 >Y 3ti. More im- portant, perhaps, is the problem of narrative inconsistency raised by the statement that Solomon had already seen the queen's hairy legs, since this vitiates the purpose of the illusion of water. AVIDA'S \"correction\" is adopted without comment by both YASSIF and LASSNER.~~~ SILBER- MAN, however, appears to ignore it and, explains the inconsistency of Saadiah's actual text as follows: Why it is necessary for the queen to reveal her hairy feet, the matter already being itnown to Solomon, is not explained. Indeed, what seems to have happened is that the author wove together the two strands, the d~sclosure and Solomon's pr~or knowledge, without much fear of contradiction. He wanted both in his story, so he put both This explanation, which concurs with the observations made above, is undoubtedly preferable to AVIDA'S unsupported alteration of the text. Saadiah's fractured syntax may well, in fact, indicate that he composed this sentence by combining two different written sources. Very possibly, he took a clause from one source and inserted it into the middle of a sentence borrowed from the other, as follows: but when he heard that she was the daughter of a demoness .... <nevertheless, he saw that her legs were hairy, .... he said: \"What should I do!\". One of Saadiah's sources was, almost certainly, a version of the Tales of Ben Sira, which is the only known previous Jewish source to combine the hairy legs motif, the depilatory, and the tradition of Nebuchad- nezzar's descent from Solomon's union with the Queen.234 The Tales of Ben Szra does not, however, include the glass palace tale itself, for which Saadiah must have used a different source or sources. 232 YASSIF, Tales, 53; LASSNER, Demonrztng the Queen, 175. 233 SILBERMAN, \"The Queen of Sheba In Judalc Tradlt~on,\" 71. 234 Saadlah may also, of course, have been aware of the Arabic sources wh~ch mention the dep~iatory but, as we have seen, the trad~tion about Nebuchadnezzar 1s found only In Jew~sh texts. It is abundantly clear that Saadiah's version of the glass palace tale is considerably indebted to the story of the four who entered 0713. In addition to the term 0713 itself and the verb t)333?, his text includes the pavement of marble stones (W'W 'IXX), which, as in the water vision episode in HZD1, \"looked as if' (?till 7/73) it were water.235 In this version, the marble pavement replaces the glass floor. It is difficult to determine whether Saadiah has taken this unique version of the tale from an earlier source or whether he was himself responsible for its composition. All we can say for certain is that the author has made a connection between the glass palace tale and the 0713 story, and that he evidently regarded the water vision episode as an integral component of the latter. He must, therefore, have relied on a source in which the D713 story and the water vision episode had already been combined. The most obvious candidate, perhaps, is babli, in which the term 0713, the verb 03335, and the expression WSW YIH are all found. The express- ion ;itill 3'2 is not, however, found in bablz and, unless the parallel is merely coincidental, must ultimately be derived from HZ. Since the relevant passage of HZ, including the word 3Efl3, is quoted by Hananael b. H~shiel:~~ it is not necessary to infer that Saadiah or his source was personally familiar with that text. It is, however, clear that this author understood both the 0713 story and the water vision episode in terms which were derived either directly or indirectly from the hekhalot tradition. Given the late date of Saadiah's composition, we should probably assume that he or his source was responsible for combining these specif- ic details from the 0719 story with the glass palace tale. If so, however, his perception of a connection between the two stories was at least partly valid. Although the earliest known versions of the glass palace tale do not contain any recognizable allusions to the 0713 story itself, they are clearly indebted to the water vision episode of the hekhalot tradition. We have observed, moreover, that Targtlm Sbeni and the Qxr'zn, our earliest sources, both seem to be alluding to a traditional story which must have been in circulation by, at latest, the early seventh 235 Compare pp. 74-77 above. Note that Saadlah renders the corrupt word 1n3 in HZ by 7h3. 236 See p. 93 above."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"288 APPENDIX century.237 It is known that the Jews of the Yemen had access to sourc- es of considerable and the possibility that Saadiah's ver- sion of the glass palace tale is in part based on a source much closer to the tale's origin cannot wholly be discounted. It is more probable, how- ever, that the the glass palace tale was originally composed under the direct influence of the hekhalot tradition about the water vision epi- sode, and that it was only linked to the story of the four by a subsequ- ent process of literary association on the part of either Saadiah or his source. 20. Concltlding Observations This investigation of the widespread tale in which the Queen of Sheba is deceived by the illusion of water produced by the glistening floor of Solomon's palace has shown that the original composition must have been adapted from the water vision episode of the hekhalot tradition. In Saadiah's version, as in the water vision episode and later recensions of \"Four Entered Paradise,\" this marvellous floor was made of white marble paving stones (V'W '31K). According to most other versions, however, it was made of glass, perhaps reflecting the meaning of the word nl?1'7~ (HZD1, E2) as understood by Hai Gaon and Rashi, who both believed it to be the equivalent of nl'7iir The Queen's failure to recognize the nature of the illusion serves, much like the error of the unworthy m3in 1711', to demonstrate her inferior status in relation to Solomon. This status is attributable, in the first instance, to the fact that she is a woman. She has, moreover, rejected the subserv- ient role appropriate to her sex and presumes to challenge Solomon's kingly, masculine authority. In the Jewish tradition, she is therefore regarded as a witch and/or a demon. WhiIe it is not certain that her hairy legs are an original component of the tale, they are undoubtedly symbolic of her \"unnatural\" usurpation of the masculine role and there are good grounds for believing that they may also be indicative of her hidden identity as (a or the) Lilith.240 AS such, the queen is identified with the forces of evil, which are perpetually in a state of rebellion 237 See p. 235 above. 238 See p. 271, n. 172 above; and SCHECHTER, \"Riddles,\" 349.

According to the tradition which produced the water vision episode, these demonic forces originate in the fluid and filthy chaos waters, by whose female taint the very substance of the material creation is rendered impure. The influence of these ideas is clearly present in the glass palace tale, where the Queen's misperception of the floor of the palace reveals her evil nature.
