It is a system for investigating Hebrew words and names and learning their \"secret sense\" by examining the numerical value of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet which Israel Regardie called \"the Alphabet of the Angels.\" This system relies on the fact that Hebrew is a.n alphabet in which letters stand for numbers, for there are no separate symbols for numbers. Words which have the same numerical value are often thought to have a significant relationship. The ancient Hebrews devised several methods of using these letter-values to encode layers of special meaning into their sacred texts and mystical teachings. Thus the \"Literal Qabalah,\"' which specialized in using these techniques to interpret Hebrew Scriptures, came into being. In addition to straightforward gematria, the Literal Qabalah includes the more complex techniques of notariqon (creating and unraveling acronyms) and temurah (transposing letters in a manner similar to cryptography) to ascribe and uncover the hidden import of words. Consequently the Literal Qabalah is the perfect complement to the so-called \"Unwritten Qabalah,\" which deals with the study of the symbol known as the Tree of Life. The elegance of this Qabalistic symbol-system has always been evident to Western occultists such as Eliphas Levi: \"On penetrating into the sanctuary of the Kaballah, one is seized with admiration at the sight of a doctrine so simple and at the same time so absolute. The necessary union of ideas and signs, the consecration of the most fundamental realities by primitive characters, the trinity of words, letters and numbers; a philosophy simple as the alphabet, profourld and infinite as the Logos; theorems more luminous and complete than those of Pythagoras; a theology which may be epitomized by counting on the fingers; an infinity which can be held in the hollow of an infant's hand; ten numerals and twenty-two letters, a triangle, a square, and a circle's such are the elements of the Kaballah, such are the primary principles of the written word, shadow of that spoken Logos which created the world!\" (From Transcendental Magic.) Hebrew is not the only alphabet to use the numeral value of letters to decipher the mystical meaning of words. Greek has also been used by the Western Mystery Tradition for this purpose. Isopsephos (literally \"equal stones\") or Greek gematria as it is often called relies on an even greater range of numerical letter values. However, its use in esoteric circles has never been as popular as that of Hebrew gematria. Aleister Crowley, whose Sepher Sephiroth is a staple in many magical libraries, planned to write a comprehensive text on Greek gematria, but never got around to finishing it. His notes on the subject were later compiled and published by the O.T.0. but they were neither complete nor, in some instances, accurate. In addition, Crowley did not find Greek gematria as satisfiing as its Hebrew counterpart. Author David Godwin, whose seminal book Godwin S Cabalistic Encyclopedia should be considered required reading for Western Esotericists, also wrote a book entitled Light in Extension: Greek Magic from Homer to Mode,w Times, which gives a section listing a number of relevant Greek words and their numerical values."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Wade Coleman's work is a welcome addition to the modern corpus of Qabalistic knowledge.

Prior to the development of the separate numbering system, each letter was assigned a numerical value. The Hebrew Aleph, and the Greek Alpha a are numerically equal to one. Therefore each word has a numerical value. The study of the correlation of words with the same numerical value is called gematria. Appendix 1 in this book has tables showing the numerical relationship to words -to numbers in Hebrew, Latin and Greek. Let us take for example the words that are numerically equal to forty: Number of days and lights it rained during the Biblical Flood. Number of weeks of the gestation of a human child. Numbers of years the Israelites wandered in the desert. Mem. One of the 3 mother letters. Mem is attributed to the element of Water. Water is the source of form, associated with the creative letter Heh, and that the multiplication of forms is the apparent subdivision of the ONE into various parts. %a bokhal. the ripening (of figs); puberty of women. * vahlahd. child boy; infant, embryo; young of an animal. 3% chawlawb. milk, With different pointing cheyeleyb, meaning: fatness; the best of it. 33 gawzal. to cut off or flay, to take away, to strip off, as skin from the flesh; to rob or plunder lahah. To languish, faint, to be exhausted, to faint; to be foolish or mad. %3 bakhal. to loathe, feel nausea 92fl chawbal. As a verb it means: to twist, to wind together, to bind; to pledge; to pervert, to damage, to act corruptly, to sin, to wound.. catena (Latin). A chain; things linked by common interest or logical series. 7 Yod Tetragrammaton. the hand of Jehovah (formative power). N% tahlah. To patch; to cover with spots. fCNS lat. Secret; to wrap, cover; to speak gently. sol (Latin). The sun; gold."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"By examining these words we see a common theme. Alchemical Water (Mem) is the source of our sustenance (chawlawb, sol). It is the creator of all things (bokhal, vahlahd). The nature of water suggest that it is the twisting (chawbal) and limitation of the primal fire (Yod Tetragrammaton, The letter Yod ' is tongue of Flame and means \"hand.\"). Limitation implies sorrow and hardship (gawzal, lahah, bakhal). The One Self must limit itself for the sake of creation. To further your study of gematria, I recommend obtaining a copy of Godwin's Cabalistic Encyclopedia, The Spice of Torah (gematria of the first 5 books of the Bible), 777 (Sepher Sephiroth), and the Hebrew Tongue Restored.

It concerns the evolution of man and man's relationship to God. Qabalah includes the understanding of the spiritual spheres of creation, and the ways by which God administers the existence of the universe. The Word Qabalah is from the Hebrew root word ('$3~) to receive. it was traditionally taught as an oral tradition, imparted from teacher to student. In the Medieval and Renaissance times, more and more of the tradition was written down. In the sixth century C.E. the Sepher Yetzirah (Book of Formation) was written. It is one of tlne cornerstone books in Qabalistic writings. It is the first work that describes the creation of tlne universe in terms of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Additionally, this is the first written work to speak of the ten Sephiroth, however, they were not named. Another important work in the Zohar, written in the thirteenth century. The Zohar states the soul of man has three elements, the Nephesh, Ruach and Neshamah. The Nephesh is the lower or animal part of man's soul and deals with instincts and bodily needs and desires. The Ruach is the middle part and the word means \"spirit\" or \"wind.\" It is here the facility of discrimination between good and evil is found. The Neshamah is the Divine Soul. This is the part of the soul that allows us to have the awareness of the existence and indwelling presence of God. It is the immortal part of the soul. Another thirteenth century word is the Gates of Light, by Rabbi Joseph Gikatilla. This book includes one of the first descriptions of the Sephiroth and their attributions. However, the geometric arrangement of the Sephiroth and how they formed the Tree of Life were not discussed. Several arrangements were developed through the centuries. The one most c:urrenl.ly used was developed in the 1650's. There are two forms of the Qabalah, traditional Jewish and \"Hermetic Qabalah.\" Hermetic Qabalah began in the Renaissance. A central point for its development is the Medici Aca.demy in Florence. Almost all modern occultism can be traced back to the developments of the sch.olars in that time and place. The Medici were a family of immense wealth, ruling Florence from the fifteenth century until 1737. Cosimo de Medici was the founder of the Platonic Academy, dedicated to the study of Greek and neo-Platonic philosophy. It was here that many Qabalistic text were translated in Latin. In this school there was a development of \"Christian Qabalah\" which incorporated elemental of Christianity (Jesus) into the Qabalah. One of the first practical works of their school was produced by Henry Cornelius Agrippa, Three Books of Occult Philosophy. Hermetic Qabalah became well known in esoteric circles with the development of Hermetic Order of the Golden dawn in the late 1 goo's, a ceremonial magic order. Within the Golden Dawn, Kabalistic principles such as the ten Sephiroth were fused with Greek and Egyptian deities. Attributes of Divine, archangelic and angelic names were assigned of each Sephiroth in each of the four worlds."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The book Liber 777, attributed to Aleister Crowley was one of the first to create a set of tables relating various parts of ceremonial magic to thirty-two numbers representing the ten spheres and twenty-two paths of the Kabalistic Tree of Life. This work is one of the first books published on gematria. Gematria is the study of words and phrases with the same numerical value are related in some way. Crowley's tabulations were the most extensive published to date. However, his book was not the first. Agrippa in his work, Three Books of Occult Philosophy, listed few dozen words relating Divine Names relating to each of the Sephiroth. David Godwin's book, Godwin's Cabalistic Encyclopedia takes the study of gematria and order of magnitude beyond Liber 777. My book, Sepher Sapphires, began out of my love of numbers and as an indispensable aid in the study and practice of magic. The important of numbers and the use of gematria cannot be underestimated. It is one of the pillars of magic. Agrippa states in Book 2, Chapter 1 : \"The Doctrines of Mathematics are so necessary to, and have such an affinity with Magic, that they that do profess it without them, are quite out of the way, and labor in vain, and shall in no wise obtain their desired effect. For whatsoever things are, and are done in these inferior natural virtues, are all done, and governed by number, weight, measure, harmony, motion, and light.\" Agrippa states in Chapter 2: \". . . all things which were first made by the nature of things in its first Age, seem to be formed by the proportion of numbers, for this was the principal pattern in the mind of the Creator. . . . hence the motion of the Stars, and the revolution of the heaven, and the state of all things subsist by the uniting together of numbers. Numbers therefore are endowed with great and sublime virtues. . . . all things that are, and are made, subsist by, and receive their virtue from numbers. For time consists of number, and all motion, and action, and all things which are subject to time, and motion [Astrology].\" Therefore, the study of number, proportion, astrology, sound and color are keys to magic. Additionally, without gematria and numerical relations, it would not be possible to create magical talismans. Agrippa continues in Book 2, Chapter 2:"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"\". . . and the proportions arising from numbers, do by lines, and points make Characters, and figures. And these are proper to Magical operations, the middle which is between both being appropriated by declining to the extremes, as in the use of letters. And lastly, all species oj\"nutura1 things, and of those things which are above nature, are joined together by certain numbers [emphasis added]. . . . Number has always a being. Yet there is one in voice, another in the proportion of them, another in the soul, and reason, and another in divine things. Gematria is one of the pillars of magical practice. I hope the practicing ceremonial magician finds this book useful. wade coleman March 2006"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Section 0 Numbers 0 - 99 I. \"All the Power that ever was or will be is here now.\" [Saying assigned to 0 of the Pattern on the Trestleboard] 11. Absolute unity. The zero is nothing, that is, no-thing and is therefore a symbol of the power of life and potencies of growth and development.. The number zero comes before any other number, and is a symbol of all beginnings. It is nothing we can measure, because it is limitless. Any number that is divided by zero is not definable.

Eliphas Levi says: Unity may be conceived as relative, manifested, possessing duality, the beginning of numerical sequence. The number one is the initial impulse, initial movement, the beginning of a phase of manifested power. Note by its shape the number one is a phallic symbol, and suggest the ideas of to thrust, insert, and lead in to its meanings. IV. \"I am a center of expression for the Primal Will-to-Good, which eternally creates and sustains the universe.\" [lSt Saying of the Pattern on the Trestleboard] 8 Aleph. bull or ox. Oxen are symbols of the taming of natural forces. Culture power and Super-consciousness. Thus the letter Aleph is a symbol of creative energy, and of the vital principles of living creatures. This vital principle comes to us in physical form as the radiant energy from the sun and is asociated with the Key 0, the Fool. Aleph is symbolic of the element Air and breath. The noun \"fool,\" is derived from the Latin follis, meaning a \"bag of wind\". Aleph is the Path of the Fiery of Scintillating Intelligence, linking Kether and Chokmah on the Tree of Life. See 2 14,37,111. Aleph means oxen. Untill the turn of the century oxen (and horses) provided the power of movement, especially in agriculture. Agriculture is the basis of civilization. Aleph is a symbol of man using the forces available to him to adapt them to his own purposes. I. Rabbi Ginsburgh says: \"The union of higher reality, the upper Yod, with the lower reality, the lower Yod, by means of the connecting Vav, of Torah, is the ultimate secret of the letter Aleph.\" [The Alef-Beit,] 11. \"The first character of the alphabet in nearly all know idioms. As symbolic image it represents universal man, mankind, the ruling being of the earth. In its hieroglyphic acceptation, it characterizes unity, the central point, the abstract principle of a thing. As sign, it expresses power, stability, continuity. Some grammarians make it express a kind of superlative as in Arabic; but this is only a result of its power as sign. On some rare occasions it takes the place of the emphatic article n either at the beginning or at the end of the words. The rabbis use it as a sort of article. It is often added at the head of words as redundant vowel, to make them more sonorous and to add to their expression.\" [d 'Olivet, 1976, p. 287.1 111. \"Aleph (1): And behold: In this immense Dwelling, within these innumerable dwellings, everywhere there is creative immanence, spontaneous, always fresh and new; imperishable pulsation of life; recurrent sparks; life-death, life-death, death and resurrection: elusive, timeless. Its manifestation can be perceived and thought of only in this manner. The non-thinkable has for its symbol the Aleph (1). The Aleph is always itself and never itself. It is ever recurring, though never the same. Aleph creates, it is creation, it is not created, yet it exists. It has no existence because all existence is continuous. It has no memory, having no past. It has no purpose, having no future. If one retains it, it remains retained. If one buries it, it remains buried. If one sets aside its obstacles, it is action. It breaks down resistances, though resistances"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"are never broken by it. Without these, Aleph does not become manifest. Without Aleph, there would be nothing at all. Such is the image of the Aleph. Aleph itself is beyond all consciousness, human or cosmic. The image of Aleph is only an image, for Aleph belongs neither to time nor to space. Aleph is beyond the realm of our thought, beyond the reach of our mind.\" [Suraes, 1992, pp. 65-66.] He adds: Aleph, no. 1, is the unthinkable life-death, abstract principle of all that is and all that is not. [ibid. p.611 IV. The Ain, or Eye of the Void, represents absolutely No Thing. It is non-manifestation pure and simple. From it alone can manifestation proceed. The first formulation of No Thing, its reflection or reverse image was Some Thing, and this was represented by the number One, Aleph. The symbol attached to this number is that of a calf, the youngling; it was the child of the mother whom it had cleaved open in breaking from the womb or opening of the Abyss (Ain). The calf is thus the symbol of the Calif as the first cleaver or maker of the cleft. it was the clef or key of the mysteries of Initiation; the calf or 'child' of all later mythologies. Aleph, the whirling cross, the thunderbolt which broke open the firmament is the glyph of Air or Space. [Grant, 1994, p. 14.1 A Alpha (Gr). \"Signifies, like the Hebrew Aleph, the beginning or a cycle of activity. It was one of the primary figures of the Gnostic mystery of Alpha and Omega, and was represented by the Tetrahedron, which it resembled in its primitive form.\" [Bond & Lea, 1977, p. 83.1 see 40, 200, 800, 81 1. 2 (prime) I. The Duad or Dyad. 11. Names for number 2: see 15,37, 73. 111. The number 2 is the reflection of the number one. The number 2 is second in a series beginning with 1. Two represents continuation, in the sense of carrying onward or extending the initial impulse symbolized by 1. Therefore 2 is a symbol of prolongation, or lengthening in time or space. That is why the point is represented by the number 1 and the line by two. IV. Key 2 in the Tarot is The High Priestess. a symbol of the mysterious working power of the supreme spirit working through tlie subconsciousness. It is also called Prakriti, tlie Great Womb or principal thing. It is ferninine in relation to Kether. Key 2 is attributed to the Moon, the reflection of the sun, just as 2 is the reflection of one. Please note that Key 2 is the path that leads from Kether to Tiphareth. V. Two is the symbol of duality, the symbol of the separation of the sexes, of space-time, etc. Any number that reductes of 2 has a characteristic of duality. In numerology the 2 is considered malific, this is based on the quality of duality associated with the number two. But the number two also concerns Wisdom, because duality is necessary for manifestation and consequently allows for man's evolution. In the Zohar the number 2 was sleced by God to begin creation. see 15, 37, 73, 106, 412 well as numbers which reduce to 2: 29, l I, 38, 47, 56, 65, 74.

Rabbi Kushner: \"Beth is drawn with two IiiSle points--one pointing above, the other pointl~ng behind and toward the right. In this way when someone asks the Beth 'Who made you?,' it points above, and if they ask, What is his name?,\" it points toward the Aleph, as if to say, 'One is his name.\"' [The Book of Letters] 11. Rabbi Blech: \"Why does the Torah begin with the letter Beth, which corresponds to the number two? Because our Sages teach that God created not one world, but two. There is b?~, this world, and N2;1 b?~, the world to come. Our life must always be lived with the awareness that the grave is not our end, but merely the second beginning.\" [The Secrets of the Hebrew Words]. 14"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"111. \"This character, as consonant, belongs to the labial sound.

Paul Case: The Hieroglyph for Beth has been lost, as the square letters employed today are of comparative recent invention. Perhaps the first idea that will be suggested to most people be all arrow-head is sharpness. Then since every Hebrew letter stands for a kind of consciousness, Beth must be a sign of mental acuteness, or penetration. It represents the sort of intelligence that manifest itself in quick perception, accurate observation, keen discernment, sagacity, and the like. An arrowhead is a point, denoting position. In logical 'position' means aff~rmation or assertion, As when we speak of 'the proof of a position,' implying order-is derived. Beth, then represents affirmative mental activity, limiting its operation to a definite locality, and exercising itself in establishing order. Hence Beth suggest initiative, direction, control, the concentration of energy in a particular field, and its specialization in definite forms. This idea of concentration is inseparable from the original form of the letter. The word 'concentrate' is derived from the Greek Kentron, an arrow point. The same Greek work also means the point around which a circle is inscribed, which shows that it implies the very notions of definite locality, order, that we have been considering. The implicates of the letter name are closely related to those connected with the hieroglyphic. Beth means \"house\" suggesting enclosure, limitation, to a special field, definite locality, and so on. As a House is the dwelling of its owner, so is the kind of mental action related to Beth the abode of spirit, because it centers the cosmic mind in a particular, local expression. [The Secret Doctrine of the Tarot, The Word, June 1916, pp. 79-80] V. \"Bayt (2): Everything that exists is the conditioning of life and the life of the conditioning. Everything that is exists both internally and externally. Each germ of life has an envelope, which derives its movement from the great cosmic force of resistance to the life which is surging up from within (If the shell does not offer the right measure of resistance, the chicken will not hatch.) This whole duality of existence-and of our own thought-is conveyed by no. 2.\" [Suraes, 1992, p. 65.1 He adds: \"is the archetype of all 'dwellings', of all containers: the physical support without which nothing is.\" [ibid. p. 611 VI. Beth, we therefore discern the glyph of the biune god who is both (Beth) male and female, yet, being so, was neither the one nor the other, but the androgyne or hermaphrodite. Beth was ascribed to the Magician or the juggler, the twofold One who, on attaining puberty, becomes replete with creative potential symbolized by the camel, the letter gimel, which is the number three. In One Person are thus resumed the trinity of powers from Aleph, the Fool or innocent babe, through Beth the androgynous bi-sexual deity, to the fully equipped sexual procreatort, Beth is the double-wanded One, the Magician (male and female).

Gimel and Daleth were not used for creation because Gimel signifies beneficence, and Daleth poverty, which maintained each other. (Zohar I, page 12). IV. Paul Case: The Earliest sign for the letter Gimel was probably a conventionalized picture of a bow. As a bow is used for shooting arrows, the first idea it suggests is propulsive force. Since the letter Beth was originally in the form of an arrowhead, it becomes evident that Gimel, the bow, as the propulsive force behind the arrow, stands for something that incites the objective mind, represented by Beth, to express itself in concentrated attention. Thus, in a sense, the bow is derived from the arrow; and this makes it an emblem of secondary existence; evolution, and the like. The bow, like the crescent, cup, sistrum, wheatear, oval, is related to the hieroglyphic as well as to the letter-name. Relaxed and unstrung, the bow is an emblem of peace; tense and strung, it signifies war. [The Secret of the Doctrine of the Tarot in the Word, July 1916, page 161, 1631. V. Gimel is a modified form of Yod. Thus the two parts of the letter hint at a concealed numeral value of 16, since Vav is 6 and Yod is 10. Among Hebrew words having the value of 16 are: 31W, Hyssop, signifying purgation or purification; elevated, exalted, High; m, She; and 3'3, like equal to. The Uniting Intelligence (Gimel) is the most important mealns of purification. It links personal consciousness to the Highest plane of being. It is the wisdom personified in Proverbs as a woman.

The number 4 is symbolic of the square, and is associated with the orgin of forms and the manifest. Eliphas Levi wrote of four \"... This number produces the cross and square in geometry. All that exists, whether good or evil, light or darkness, exists and is revealed by the tetrad, (it is) the unity of construction, solidity and measure.\" VI. Four is associated with space-time and therefore with the first day of creation and the framework of the evolution of man. The 4th Sephiroth is Chesed (Mercifulness). Every number whose numerical reduction is 4 concerns the solid aspect of things. VII. Four relates to the classifLing activity of self-consciousness (Key 1, The Magician), induced by the response of subconscious (Key 2, The Empress) to to creat mental images (Key 3, The Empress). These mental images are arranged by the classifying activity is reason (Key 4, The Emperor). VIII. Dominznce is attributed to Key 4, the classifying activity of self-consciousness (induced by conscious response to sub-conscious mental imagery). In its highest aspect this dominance is the cosmic order, that which orders and arranges the substance manifested in every form. Key words associated with Key 4 are reason, measurement, record-keeping, tabulation, and beneficence. IX. The number 4 is occultly connected with the completion of the 'sanctum sancitorum' -The ocean of a higher consciousness. [R.C. Allegory, page 1 61. X.

It is the power to admit or bar, to retain or to let out, and entrance or exit. It is a passageway from within to without. Daleth is associated with Key 4, The Empress and creative imagination. It is the entrance (door) to new life and to new worlds. Because the value of Daleth is four, it is often cited in Qabalah as the sign of the 4th Sephirah, Mercy or Beneficence. 11. The door is a feminine symbol representing birth, reproduction, and the entry of life into manifestation. Daleth is the Womb, the door of personal life. It opens to receive the seed and closes to retain the germ during gestation. It opens again to send the new life into the world. This is activity occurs also on planes above the physical. 111. Rabbi Kushner: \"And why does the roof of the Daleth extend backwards a little to the right, in the direction of Gimel?

This number originally signified the womb through the symbolism of the Goddess of the Seven Stars, Ursa Major, the constellation of the Thigh which typified the birthplace of Light in the Dark of the Abyss [i.e. the Abyss as the nightsky or gulf of space]. Seven later became the number of Venus, the planetary representative of the Goddess, when the concept was romanticized and applied to sexual love between humans as distinct from the primary and stellar symbolism that signified bestial congress. Seven thus became synonymous with the mechanism of sexual polarity symbolized by Gemini (the letter attributed to which is Zain) under the influence of Mercury, the masculirle aspect of Venus or, more correctly, the positive aspect of the hermaphroditic polarity typified by the sephiroth Hod and Netzach. Zain is mystically associated with the yoni, the secret or hidden eye (ayin) which, together with the letter 'z' - the letter of the serpent -becomes Zayin lor Zain. Zain is of major importance as being the S(word) of the Serpent, which is Silence. Hence, in the most secret Mystery Cults the Aeon of Zain is said to be devoid of a Word. It is the silent transmission of sexual energy in polarity that vibrates the Word in Silence, and that Word is as a Sword that cleaves the Abyss and it is heard of No-One. It is said that in the Aeon of Zain 'humanity is booked for a turn round tlhe back of the Tree', which explains why no word will be heard, for there will be No-One (Nun = the Abyss) to hear it. The subject-object relationship will have ceased to exist. The Serpent and the Sword are the dual glyph of this arcanum and such is the special emblem of Set.

We may expect, on this account, to learn that the Tarot trump to be considered in this chapter symbolizes the same root ideas that are brought to mind by the picture of the magician. All cabalistic interpretations of Cheth agree that the letter stands for something that necessitales labor. Fabre D'Olivet was not always certain of his philology, but he was a thorough kabbalist; so that, while we must nearly always reject his views as a alphabetical origins we can often accept his explanation of the esoteric significance of the Hebrew letters. He says of Cheth: \"This letter is the sign of the e1ementa.t-y existence; it is the image of a kind of equilibrium, and attaches itself to ideas of effa'rt, of labor, and of normal and legislative action. It is a symbol of that which requires the expenditure of strength of power; and it impl~ies that the energy so used is directed to a definite end. Behind all these notions is the idea that the field stands in opposition to the worker. At the beginning of his labors it presents difficulti,:s, even dangers. In its original state it gives trouble. It offers problems and puzzles that must be solved and mastered. After it has been brought under control it co-operates, in a manner of speaking, with the worker; but first of all it must be overcome by 'normal and legislative action.' 24"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The outcome of such action is the establishment of order. Putting things in order is, in fact, the great secret of human achievement. No matter what you do, before you can succeed you must get rid of disorder somewhere. The more recondite significance of Cheth is related to the doctrine that this letter is a sign of elementary existence. The word 'elementary' as used by Fabre D'Olivet, means rudimental. What he speaks of is what the alchemist called their first matter, or chaos. The latter word implies disorder, Webster defines it as 'the confused, unorganized state of primordial matter before the creation of distinct and orderly forms!

The third letter is Heh, which indicates definition (being the definite article) and also vision. Thus the very name of Eve is, to a Qabalist, a formula of the creative process.

Rabbi Ginsburgh says: The Kaph is composed of three connected lines with rounded comers, forming the image of a crown lying on its side, as if resting on the head of the king while in a state of prostration or self- nullification ... The literal meaning of Kaph is palm ...p lacing palm on palm is an act and sign of subjugation, similar to the act of bowing before a king. Whereas in bowing one totally nullifies one's consciousness in the presence of the King, in placing palm on palm one enters into a state of supplication and prayer to the King to reveal new will from His Supernal Crown (Will) to His subjects. [The Alef-Beit] IV. Paul Case: In the pictorial alphabet of the early Semites, the sign for Kaph represented the palm of the Hand. From this pictograph two sets of implicits may be derived. The first is a development of ideas connected with the fact that the palm is the active working part of the hand, and all the implicits of this group have their origin in the verb 'to grasp'. The second chain of association begins with the universal belief that the palm is a map of life, which affords a skilled reader an accurate record of the past, and enables him to make a reliable forecast of future probabilities.

The blood's chemical condition can be modified by intelligent control of diet, and by the response of the ductless glands to suggestions. This is the means in which changes in cell-structure are brought about to unfold our consciousness to precipitate the Stone of the Wise. The law is no thought without corresponding cell-activity. To think any particular thought it is necessary that our cells are made so that they can transmute the vital principle into specific thought forms. Thus our work is to control of the cell forming functions of the body, to the end that cells may be developed capable of responding to the vibrations of thought and perception beyond the ranges of ordinary human consciousness.

Adam is the Microcosmic philosopher's stone and (the elements) acting thus in concert upon each other, there result from them a harmonious whole, which composes what is called the Philosopher's stone, or the Microcosm. Adam is the \"Red Earth,\" the earth of the sages. I. Genesis 1:26: Then God said, \"Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of tlie sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.\" 11. \"And-he-said, HE-the-Gods, (declaring his will) we-will-make Adam in-the-shadow-of-us, by-the-like-making-like-ourselves; and-they- shall-hold-the-scepter, (they shall rule, they, Adam, universal man) in-the-spawn breeding- kind-of-the-seas, and-in-the-flying-kind of-the- heavens, and-in-the quadrupedly-walking-kind,"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"and-in-the-whole-earth-born-life, and-in-all- moving-thing crawling-along upon-the-earth. He comments: Adam ... I beg those who are reading this without partiality, to observe that Moses does not fall here into the modern error which has made of man a particular species in the animal kingdom; but only after having finished all that he wished to say concerning the elementary, the vegetable and the animal kingdom, he passes on to a kingdom distinct and higher that he names Adam. Among the savants who have searched for the etymology of the word Adam, the majority went no further than its grossest exterior, nearly all of them have seen only red clay, or simple clay, because the word Piat signifies red or reddish; because by mas, the earth in general, has been understood; but they failed to see that these words themselves are compounds, and that they can only be roots of words still are compound; whereas the word P'tN being more simple cannot come for it. The name given to Adam signifies not only \"homo,'' man, but it characterizes, as the Samaritan word meaning universal, that which we understand by mankind, and which we would express much better by saying kingdom of man; it is collective man, man abstractly formed of the assemblage of all men. This is the literal meaning of PW. This root is P'1 which carries with itself every idea of assimilation, of similitude, of homogeneity. Governed by the sign of power and stability N, it becomes the image of an immortal assimilation, of an aggregation of homogeneous and indestructive parts. Such is the etymology of the Adam, in its figurative sense. The hieroglyphic meaning, which Moses allows nevertheless, to be understood in the same verse, and to which he makes allusion, by causing the same noun, which is singular, to govern the future plural verb 1ll' [let them rule]: quite contrary to the rule which he had followed, of making the noun of the Being of Beings which is plural, govern always the singular verb. The hieroglyphic root of the name Adam, P'PC is '1N, which composed of the sign of unitary, principiant power, and that of divisibility, offers the image of a relative unity, such as might be expressed, for example, by means of the simple although compound number 10. The root number being endowed with the collective sign P, assumes an unlimited development: that is to say, the symbolic number 10, being taken to represent the root W, the sign P will develop its progressive power to infinity, as 10; 100; 1,000; etc. [d'olivet, 1976, pp. 56-59.] 111. Adam at its higher aspect is \"A symbol of the Divine nature of humanity-the Archetypal Man of the three higher planes.\" And in its lower aspect, \"A symbol of the lower mind, energies from the desire plane, but receptive of impression from the higher nature. This is the fallen mind (Adam).\" [Gaskell, 1981, pp. 22- 23 .] IV. Issac Myer writes: \"The Great androgyne, the Adam Illa-Ah or Adam Qadman, which includes in itself all the ideas, and all the content of all the prototypes of the existence. This (first) Adam is considered as the first distinctive beginning in the finite, and therefore is the sole occupant of the Atzluthic world ... in reading the first and second chapters of Genesis, a distinction was made by the learned of the Israelites, between the higher Adam, i.e. the Adam Qadmon, or first paradigmic ideal man, and he inferior (terrestrial) Adam ... \"The third Adam is the terrestrial Adam, made of dust and placed in the Garden of Eden. This Adam was also an androgyne ... it had, when first created, a glorious simulacrum or light body, and answer to the Yetziratic world ...

'1 [Daleth] is the sign of multiplication, abundance; final [Mem] is the sign of unlimited plurality. The name Adam therefore means the one becoming many. But as a spiritual being, Adam was only One. As we said in speaking of the group-souls, a spiritual conception, a species or genus cannot, as such, multiply. It can only multiply in the number of individuals comprised in it, and this multiplication can only take place on the physical plane ... We have now, the explanation of Adam being both singular and plural, him and them; and both male and female. In his singular aspect he was the human principle, the soul or essence of humanity. As a spiritual unity Adam was sexless, but sex was a necessity of multiplication in the physical realm-and in the physical realm alone ... [in Genesis 2:7] What we are told of now is still a spiritual act, the formation of a spiritual being in the spiritual realm, but eternal to the essential being of God. The Adam still has no physical or material form of existence.

The fact that Mem final can be 40 (i.e. resistance) and can leap to 600 (i.e. cosmic fertility) indicates the vast range of possibilities in man. The true vocation of mankind is this transfiguration of 40 into 600. The text goes on to say that Adam can be considered as a living shadow, or image, of the Elohim: given the potential of greater power of resistance than any other being, he can become the receptacle of the greatest intensity of life on this planet. (In a certain respect, we can see this illustrated today wherever men are being trained to withstand the strain of living in rockets, beyond gravitation, on the floor of the oceans, in the Antarctic ice-fields, or to test their physical and psychological resistance in all kinds of competitions.)\" [Suraes, 1992, p. 97.1 VIII. \"We know that Adam is a schema for the human being. It indicates that Aleph, the pulsating creativeness of life-death, is within him, struggling so as not to drown in the absorption of Dam, 4.40. The earth, as Adamah, claims that blood as belonging to it. It says, mythically: I, Adamah [;wYH], am your mother and spouse; you, my husbandman, are kin to me: you are earth. If we accept this proposition and live accordingly, the Aleph in us suffers death by suffocation, just as it is buried in Eretz where nature continuously repeats its prototypes, each according to its species. But the Hebraic myth states that YHWH-Elohim has breathed in man the Sheen (300) which is the organic movement of the whole universe (Gen. 2, 7). This develops into the well-known dispute between YHWH and the earth as to whom the blood belongs. YHWH's point contended for in argument is founded on a basic postulate of Qabala: the unity of energy and of its contradictory aspects as spirit and matter, good and evil, high and low, etc. They coalesce in the synthetic formula Yod-Hay- Waw-Hay where their two lives fertilize each other.\" [Suraes, 1992, gp. 1 14- 11 5.1 IX.

Yet here is a treasure of wisdom that is part of the lore that Moses was instructed in as a youth in Egypt.

Fifty-two is i3 (Ben), and -7 #% aba ve-ama, or Father and Mother. This represents the conjoining of Chokmah with Binah.

That is, the dog became a completed man, and this involves the use and direction of the Mars force in accordance with a reversal of ordinary procedure, for the other spies reported unfavorably and caused the people's hearts to melt. But Caleb at 40 stands for the reversal, symbolized by the Hanged Man (associated with the letter Mem). Caleb was a Kennizite, an outsider by birth, who was adopted into Israel,.

I. \"The 14'~ tunnel is suffused with the kala of Venus represented by the Whore. Her qabalistic attribution is Daleth, meaning 'a door'; the door that permits of access to her house or womb, and egress from it. Her cosmic power-zone is Venus. This tunnel backs the first Reciprocal Path on the Tree of Life; its infernal counterpart is the base of the pyramid which, when inverted, is balanced upon the point of the Ain in the void of the Abyss. The name of its sentinel is Dagdagiel. Her number is 55, which is a mystic number of Malkuth, the power-zone of Earth. Fifty-five, as 5 x 1 I, resumes the formula of magick (1 I), set in motion or powered by shakti (5). It is also the number of ?Dn, 'silence', which is the formula of woman (shakti) when she becomes pregnant with the child of light produced by the next kda. The word HIM, 'to swell', is indicative of this condition; and W (a metathesis of PR) means to 'conceive', 'to have sexual intercourse', and 'to create', 55 is also the number of 352, 'the bride', 'the daughter-in-law', which suggests the cosmic bride Malkuth, the daughter of IHVH, she that is the final term (Heh) of manifestation."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"The daughter is the symbol of imminent return; of the incipient reversion of manifestation to its primal state of nonmanifestation; of being re-becoming non-being. In the present Aeon the Son is the Child, but in the coming Aeon of Maat the Child will be the Daughter, for at the end of that Aeon Malkuth will once more return to its sleep of dissolution (pralaya) prior to a new manifestation. The title of the Atu of this Path is The Daughter of the Mighty Ones. The theme is repeated by the word MUT (a form of Maat) which also adds to 55 and which signifies to 'shake', waver, 'totter', 'fail', 'decay', 'die'. It derives from the Egyptian word mut, meaning to 'end' or 'die'. The sigil of Dagdagiel shows the letter Daleth reversed and in the form of a gallows from which hangs an inverted triangle above the letters AVD. AVD (Od) is the magick light. The triangle is the inverted pyramid set in the Abyss with its apex in the Void (Ain), for this reciprocal tunnel is reflected into the gulfs beyond Kether. The implication is that the pyramid is the magick light or Fire Snake suspended from a gallows in the form of the Woman of Night [A term signifying the 'Elemental Gods'] whose vagina (Daleth = door) is here reversed. This peculiarity shows that she is an initiate of the highest sexual mysteries and that she possesses the special mark [The retromingent vulva] of a Scarlet Woman. Her totems are the dove (the Typhonian bird), the sparrow, and the sow. In a holograph note in his personal copy of Liber 777, Crowley notes against this path (column xxxvii): 'The Sow = type of Venus which matches Mars (opposed to romantic and other higher types). Mars = boar. By this he means that as the virgin basks in the idyllic light of romantic or unrealized love, the sow wallows in the sty of sensuality. But the comparison of the Sow of Venus with the Boar of Mars comports another mystery which may be fathomed only in terms of the Draconian Current. The sow (Babalon = whore) is the qlipha [a harlot] or outer shell of the Goddess. Her inner mystery involves the kalas or Kali Herself, for She is the ultimate Mother. In New Aeon terms, therefore, Mars is the cosmic power-zone assigned to Ra-Hoor-Khuit as the child (Har) of the present Aeon, because the blood associated with this zone (of Mars) is not the blood of the male shed in battle, but the blood of the female that embodies the child. The dove also is attributed to the 14\"' kala. The dove was the bird of blood (feminine source) before it became the bird of air (niasculine spirit). First was Mars-Kali-Typhon, then came Venus-Nephthys-Nu-lsis. The magical power corresponding to this kala is, traditionally, the ability to distil love philtres. The phrase is an euphemism for the vaginal vibrations emanating from the virgin in the form of sexual magnetism that attracts the Creative Light into her womb. In the verse of the grimoire pertaining to this kala, it is written: The Virgin of God is enthroned upon an oyster-shell; she is like a pearl, and seeketh 70 to her 4. In her heart is Hadit the invisible glory. The oyster is the typical aphrodisiac; the virgin is drunk upon its shell and seeketh 70 [i.e. the erect phallus symbolized by the Eye (Ayin = Eye = 70) of the Devil] to her 4 [Daleth, 4, = door, i.e. vagina]. In her heart is Hadit (i.e. Set, the Devil Himself), the invisible glory that motivates her desire. The virgin thus becomes the whore, or, in the language of magical symboli!sm, the entranced priestess becomes enlightened or awakened; the pythoness becomes oracular, being inspired with the divine spirit. Hence the magical formula of this kala is Agape, the number of which is 93, which is the number of desire or will (Thelema) and of the Devil (Aiwass) Himself. All aphrodisiacs and all soft voluptuous odours are ascribed to this kala, the presiding deities of which are Hathor, Aphrodite, Kapris Cottyto, and, in the tantric systems, Lalita [The Lilith of rabbinical lore], the sexual aspect of shakti (power). Diseases typical of the 14\"' kala are syphilis, gonorrhea, and nymphomania. The element of nymphomania is evident in the succubi or shadow-women generated from the yorii of the Goddess whose magical weapon is the girdle. The shadow woman is the means of dream control for it is through her magical circle that the dreamer enters dimensions that lie: on the nightside of the inverted pyramid which is a projection of the yantra of the Goddess.

The word 'us', in both verses, is qabalistically equal to 66 which is the 'Mystic Number of the Qliphoth and of the Great Work'. Here then is a key to the real meaning of the Qliphoth which has eluded qabalists and occultists alike, for few have fathomed the function of the qliphoth in relation to the Great Work. But when it is realized that the 'world of shells' comprises the reverse side of the Tree it is possible to understand why it has been regarded as wholly evil. The qliphoth are not only the shells of the 'dead' but, more importantly they are the anti-forces behind the Tree and the negative substratum that underlies all positive life. As in the case of the Egyptian Book of the Dead, the title of which signifies its precise opposite, so also the Jewish Tree of Death is the noumenal source of phenomenal existence. It is the latter that is false for the phenomenal world is the world of appearances, as its name implies. The noumenal source alone IS, because it is NOT. Once this truth is grasped it becomes evident that the ancient myths of evil, with their demonic and terrifjling paraphernalia of death, hell, and the Devil, are distorted shadows of the Great Void (the Ain) which persistently haunt the human mind. These mysteries are explained in qabalistic terms by the number 66 which is the sum of the series of numbers from one to eleven. 66 is the number of the word LVL which means 'to twist' or 'go round' (the other side of the Tree). As already noted, humanity is 'booked for a turn round the back of the Tree' during the Aeon of Zain. In the Aeon of Zain humanity will have transcended the illusions of time and space, having understood the noumenal basis of phenomenal consciousness.

Sometimes Binah is translated as \"Intelligence.\" This must not be confused with saykel (350), which is the more general term for intelligence, or more accurately, for consciousness. I. The fundamental meaning of Binah is the power of separation, the ability to distinguish truth from falsehood, and the power to adapt means to ends. Thus it is the mental ability to distinguish one thing from another which is the basis for understanding. Binah is both the dark sterile Mother, Ama and WH Aima, the bright, pregnant Mother. This aspect of Reality is the matrix of all possible specialized forms of expression. Ama represents this aspect of Being prior to the beginning of a cycle of the Life-power's self-manifestation. Aima is the fertile womb from which flow forth all forms made manifest during such a cycle of the Life-power's self-expression. Binah is called Shabbathai, the Sphere of Saturn, because every appearance of special, particularized manifestation necessitates limits of quantity, quality, mass, form, etc. In the astrological terminology of Ageless Wisdom, the contracting, limiting power is called Saturn. Note, in this connection, that the birth of living creatures results from contraction of the womb 109"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"which carries the body during its period of gestation. Binah is attributed Neshamah 7lBB'f (399, the Divine Breath, the Holy Spirit in Christian symbolism. No matter how gravely a human being sins, this Neshamah is never involved. It is the highest aspect of Soul. The seat of the Divine Life's intuitive knowledge of all that it is, and of all that it must inevitably bring into manifestation because of what it knows itself to be. In man, Neshamah is the source of intuitive knowledge of spiritual truth. It is also the supreme source of guidance in the progress of man toward mastery. Understand that the Sabbath of the Eternal never ends. How then may man find rest, save in the heart of the Mother? For that heart is the ever virgin Neshamah, and she is one with the Everlasting Heavens. Dark she is, but lovely, as Solomon says. The source of terror to the ignorant, and therefore Pachad (Geburah) depends with all its stern judgments from her. Yet is she also Ameka, thy Mother, and her heart swells with love. Ameka is 61, and this is pl beten, the dark womb of creation, and TN Ain, the Boundless, for there are no limits to the overflowing love, springing like a fountain of Living Waters from the heart of the Mother. Everywhere may you find that heart, Children of Light, and nowhere else shall it be found, save at the center, which is the Holy Temple in the Midst (an), where Shabbathai has its abode. There all is perfect rest, and thus was the great temple on earth built by Solomon, whose name signifies 'the peaceful,' and set up in Jerusalem the dwelling place of peace. For these outer things are but figures. Until you find the Hill of Zion in yourselves they shall be no more than figures, and dark ones in very truth. There is a continual recurrence to the idea that the ONE is timeless. That sequence has little or no meaning to the consciousness which is above and beyond all human thought. Thus often there seems to be confusion in their words. For example Binah is identified with Ameka, thy Mother, and immediately this is indicated as being the same as the first veil of Ain, and as the vast expanse of the dark nothingness which is the womb of creation. Yet all the while dealing also with Saturn, and with the Path of Tav, and so with the idea of the eternal equilibrium or perfect rest at the center. Moreover, that rest is by clear implication identified with the Waters of Life. You may remember the saying \"To those who labor I will give you rest,\" and to have told the woman that if she but knew who was speaking to her, that knowledge would be a well of living water. The meaning is not far to seek. Had she known who spoke to her she would have known the central Reality of her own Being, and who knows that, finds eternal life, eternal rest, and perfect peace, for these three are one. What you must take as your clue to the application to most of the Text referring to Shabbathai, is the place of Tav on the Tree. Note that the Mezla descends to Malkuth through Tav, is what completes the perfection of Binah.\" See C.32.

It is a mystery of darkness @5), limitation (BaD), and various appearances reported by our senses (see $? & Key 15). It is also a secret (770) of renewal and regeneration. I. Paul Case: \"The Hebrew word for silence 303, claims our attention now. Its first letter is Heh, and so is its last. Our teachers in the Qabalah, tell us that the first Heh is the Heh of the Mother, Aima of Binah, while the last is the Heh of the Bride, Malkuth. The first Heh, therefore corresponds to the creative world and to the faculty of intuition. Thus it reminds us that to receive the interior tuition which reveals to us the mysteries of cosmic law we must learn to keep silent. The inner voice is not heard by those who indulge in needless talk, furthermore, the letter Heh is the letter of sight, and for the clearest, intensest vision, silence is essential. The second Heh may serve to remind us of Lao-Tze dictum the state should be governed as we cook small fish, without much business.\" When we come to apply whatever magical knowledge we may possess to the actual work of taking our part in the administration of the kingdom, we shall accomplish more work and do it better if we do not have too much to say about our plans and projects. The middle letter of haseh, Samekh, hints that in silence there is a supporting or sustaining power. That this is true every practical occultist learns sooner or later. The practice of silence as to what you aim at, as to what you are doing, has two very important practical results. First of all, it prevents other people from leaning of your plans and perhaps setting themselves in opposition to you. Thus silence is over and over again a time-saver and an energy-saver. Secondly, the practice of silence serves to intensity desire-force. Your one aim (the arrow of the archer, represented by the letter Samekh) is something that you must keep religiously to yourself. Not even your closest friends should know of it. This one aim is typified in Revelation by the white stone, upon which is written a name which no man knows, save him that receives it. The one things you have to do in order to fulfill your destiny will be, or perchance has been, revealed to you from within. See that you tell no 113"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"man.

The Kabbalists in speaking of this wine, that he who drank of it would know all the secrets of the sages. I can only offer to the read the grammatical analysis of the Hebrew word, leaving the rest to his sagacity. I have often spoken during the course of my notes of the root jiN [Ain], which enjoys the universal privilege of characterizing alternately, being and nothingness, everything and nothing ... It is evident that this root, emerging from the deepest abysses of nature, rises toward being or fall toward nothingness, proportionally, as the two mother vowels 1N, enlighten or obscure it. From its very principle, it suffices to materialize or to spiritualize the convertible sign ?., in order to fix its expression upon objects genuine or false. Thus one sees it in ilN, virtue, strength, valor, and in p, vice, vanity, cowardice, in ji9 the generative faculty of Nature; in I?' the clay of the earth. In the word here referred to, the two vowels are not only enlightened by replaced by the sign of potential manifestation ', image of intellectual duration. This sign being doubled constitutes, among the Chaldeans, one of the proper names of the divinity. United to the final sign 1, it seems to offer the very body of that which is incorporeal.

The darkness of Ereb, its sadness, the avidity with which it is believed that it devours the beings which fall into its pale, could they be better characterized than by a dark and voracious bird such as the raven?

Meditation requires us to use the goad of attention to hold the mind to the central idea. see 491,67 Psalm 49:3: \"My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.\" Meditation is literally \"and- utterance-of' and spelled MATI in The Interlinear NIV Old Testament. see 724. n0Tl Myrtle plant (sacred to Venus). bride; Esther's former name. Esther is the regular Syrian form of the name Ishtar, the Babylonian Goddess corresponding to Astarle, and associated in Babylonian astrology with Venus. Hadassah, is the Hebrew translation of the Babylonian Hadashatu, \"bride,\" used as a title for Ishtar. The significance of \"Myrtle,\" points to the Venusian correspondence, but may be an occult blind. The theme of the story of Esther, is the triumph of Justice over injustice. But the deeper meaning concerns Babylonian traditions of conflict between the Gods of the Elamites and Babylon. These traditions veil profound doctrines of ageless wisdom. Ayin and Daleth moreover, is the very Venus who is the \"Bride\", hadashatu, or hadassah. see 80. The actual time; a fixed point in time or I.

Very often we come across little indication like this which show that the wisdom of the eastern world was by no means lost when it was transferred to Europe through Greek. As the New Testament shows, the number-letter system of the Hebrews and Babylonians was adopted by the Gnostics and adapted to the requirements of Greek. In the Old Testament, the whole book of Esther is a mine of information about the Semitic conceptions of the Great Mother. The well- known orientalist, A.H. Sayce says: 'Ishtar appears as Esher in the Book of Esther, where Mordecia, it may be noted, is a derivation from 122"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Merodach ('the God'). Note that in this Book Esther is the second Queen. The first is Vashti, 'The Beautiful One', who refuses to come forth at the time of the feast, when the common people were assembled at Shushan. Vashti is the high Priestess in Tarot, for she is the hidden one who cannot be drawn forth for display amongst the multitude of ordinary thoughts and perceptions (common people). Esther is the Empress, the 'Starry One'. The scene of the story is laid in Shushan (PW), and the place-name is ordinarily translated 'Lily'. But the word Shushan, and its feminine equivalent Sushanah flfm), really signifies 'rose', and is so translated in many Qabalistic books. Roses, it will be remembered, are sacred to Aphrodite. Another plant scared to Venus. Furthermore, 30Tl is the number 74, and this is the number of 7&, Lamed, the ox- goad, that Hebrew letter which corresponds to Libra, ruled by Venus, and represented in Tarot by the figure of justice. In the story of Esther, Ahasuerus is the unmanifest self, and Mordecai (Marduk or Merodach) is the manifest self. Haman signifies the illusion of separate personality which demands reverence for itself. The Jews are the higher qualities, which were scattered through the lower nature. Such is the psychological interpretation. There are many other occult meanings in this book, which is recognized by all Qabalists as being packed with esotericism.

Just as it is the desire of darkness to merge itself in light, so it is the desire of night to merge itself in day.

Note also that the first path from Nogah is Peh, a path of Madim. And the mediator between Geburah and Netzach, Mars and Venus or Will and Desire is Tiphareth, the Sun.

Rabbi Munk says: \"The Peh consists of a Kaph with a Yod suspended inside it; the Kaph stands for practical action, while the Yod represents wisdom. Thus, the letter Peh represents a spiritual quality (wisdom) contained within the proper vessel for its practical realization ...

Rabbi Kardia says: \"Why is the letter Cheth assigned to \"the function of speech,\" and Peh to \"the mouth as the organ of speech?\" Words that originate in the mouth can never protect, and only exhibit the negative side of Mars, aggression.

In Yesod, Mars and Saturn give place to Jupiter, and the path of Samekh above Yesod is doubly related to Jupiter (Jupiter rules Sagittarius, attributed to Samekh), as you see from the letters O (Sagittarius) and 3 (Jupiter).

Through countless generations the One Life perpetuates Its utterance by means of successive generations of human bodies. That is why the Wise say that in Yesod is the field of renewal through procreation that is why never blasphem the source of Life. Genesis says \"be fruitful and multiply,\" but there is a fruitfulness beyond that of the flesh, and a multiplication of the power of life having children. Thus in the word Yesod, may you read Yod Sod - or Sod, Yod the secret of Yod. Forms are manifest in varying degrees, and when it is your office to bring forth subtle forms, you fail if you miss your opportunity through the false belief that in the bringing forth of forms less subtle there is any essential failure. see 363,23, 11,430 & C.27.

The Zohar [IV: 225A, p. 2681 Comments: \"Observe that when the priest spreads his hands at the time he blesses the people, the Shekinah comes and hovers over him and endows him with power [Literally, fills his hands]. When blessing, the priest raises his right hand above the left, so as to cause the right to prevail over the left. All the grades over which he spreads his hands, are thus blessed from the source of all things, from the well called righteous [i.e. TO', Yesod] the source of all is the future world, the sublime source which illumines all faces, whence are kindled all lamps. It has a counterpart in the source and spring of the well whence all the lower lamps and the lower lights are kindled and radiate. So one corresponds to the other.

Another secret is the ability to reason out ideas and destroy them is an aspect of the reproductive energy. see 2 1 I. Those who know the secret of Yod become the extenders of the paternal Life and Light. Therefore Yesod is called the Sphere of the Moon, which pertains also to Gimel, the letter of Union.

For spiritual Israel, there is the circumcision of the heart by the control of the emotional nature. In Yod the seed of all the letters is the secret of the covenant and this secret is the Peh-Heh, the mouth of the eternal.

The physical rite of circumcision does unveil the paternal Yod, but the Covenant is not its symbol. What is hidden here goes deeper. In miylah the first letter is P% (Mem), then comes Ti (Yod), then T35 (Lamed), and last, (Heh). Yod and Mem spells 72, which is the Living Water, transmitting life. Of that life, the letter Yod at the end of % is the sign, for Yod is the first letter of ;n;P, the name of the Most High. Thus Yod stands for Chaiah, the life-force in Chokmah, and the letters Lamed and Heh which conclude 35% are referred to Venus (Nogah) and Mars (Madim) respectively. The Covenant reveals the paternal Yod in Chokmah. Yet is the symbol a clue to a fact, for the cosmic life-force is projected, generation after generation, into manifestation through human bodies, and the power of Mars is combined with that of Venus in the Vital Soul in Yesod. This is, even now, a closely guarded practical secret. Even these words are veiled. See C. 10. 11. Peh represents the Mars force and is a clue to the meaning of ?I?%, circumcision, which refers to the masculine aspects of the Life Power's activity in reproduction.

In Greek mythology Tv+ov the father of the winds and the son of TYPHOE, with whom he was sometimes confused.

Arthor Redman: Typhon is an aspect or shadow of Osiris. Typhon is not the distinct evil principle or Satan of the Jews; but rather the lower cosmic principle of the divine body of Osiris (81, 590), the God of them. The true meaning of the Egyptian myth is that Typhon is the terrestrial and material envelope of Osiris, who is the indwelling spirit thereof. In the Qabalistic system which we call the Tree of Life this quarternaty of lower principles corresponds to the four Sephiroth below Tiphareth ... if one remembers that every anthropomorphic creative God was with the ancients the Life-giver and the Death-dealer -0siris and Typhon.. It will be easy for him to comprehend that Typhon or Apophis (861) as he was also named was but a symbol of the lower quaternary, the ever conflicting and turbulent principles of differentiated chaotic matter, whether in the universe or in man, while Osiris symbolized the highest spiritual triad. nobiscum (Lt). with us.

Guph is lowest and most external aspect of personality. Assigned to Malkuth, the fruit of completion of the Tree of life. Gimel in Guph stands for the Uniting Intelligence joining Yekhidah in Kether to the Ego seated in the hearts of men in Tiphareth. It is directly related to the Life-force in Chokmah. Vav stands for the Ego as the inner teacher. The burden of his teaching is that true wisdom must ever find expression in loving-kindness. Peh stands for the destruction of error and represents Yesod (by numeration) and the powers of the automatic consciousness. It is during man's Life in the physical body that he must accomplish the work which overcomes the delusions which seem to limit him. Guph is the starting point for the work which leads to liberation and is also the place where the Great Work finds completion. The essence of Guph is the serpent-fire of which the letter Teth is a symbol. This fire comes forth through the working of the Active Intelligence, assigned to Peh. The number of Guph is 89, and this 9 is Teth, and its channel of outpouring is Peh, or 80. Add 8 and 9, and you see the power of Zain (7) coming forth through 1 to bring forth 8, or Cheth. 89 is Teth (9), operating through 80, or the spiraling light-power working through the Mouth of the Eternal (Teth through Peh). When lightening flashes, thunder roars, and thunder has been for the ages a symbol for the Voice of God. So is your body far more than a lump of earth. It is the intelligence that unites us with the Crown (Kether). It is the Nail (Vav) that joins us to the Paternal Wisdom. Guph is truly the Mouth of the Lord. For in Guph are the letters 2, 'I and 8, and these letters unite us forever with the Kingdom. See C.8. 111. Guph is h2, Kallah, the Bride, and in her name is shown the perfection of the Kingdom. The Kingdom is 10, and Kallah is 55, or the sum of the numbers from 1 to 10. The Bride, 353, is also 537, the ALL. In Guph is the whole creation made manifest. Therefore is Guph, the body, the whole, the holy temple of the Most High. And where is this Temple? It stands in the midst, or center, and in it abides forever Adonai Melek 'm), our Lord and King, Holy is His Name, Blessed be He! Guph is really the Kingdom, or the Bride who is the ALL. Can anyone separate even the smallest body from the whole? Through a single atom course all the forces of the universe, and whatever body you may take for an example, whether it be small as an electron or great as a galaxy, this remains true.

Using Tzaddi, the fish- hook via meditation, raises Nun, the fish, out of the \"Water\" or subconsciousness into the region of self-conscious awareness; it also raises the Scorpio force to awaken the higher brain centers. see 20, 106,477, 104. I. The letter Tzaddi is looks like a small Kaph, which forms the lower part of the letter, combined with two Yods. Thus the secret value of Tzaddo is Kaph (20) plus two Yods (2x10) or 40. This indicates a connection between Tzaddi and Mem (0, 40). Note that Aquarius (attributed to Tzaddi) means water-bearer and Mem means water. Note that the function of meditation serves to bring about the changes of personal consciousness which leads to the mental reversal pictured in Key 12 (The Hanged Man), corresponding to Mem.

As a verb mawlak: to administer, to reign, to rule, to counsel. As a noun meyleyk: \"king, ruler, prince\". It refers to Tiphareth as the seat of the Higher Ego or Christos which has dominion over all things. The essential Spirit of Man is the dominant power in creation. The alchemical water is actually the agency whereby the rule or administration of the Life-power is established over all forms and condition of manifested being. see 40,45,52,67,3 1 1, 108 1. I. The King, speaking through that Guph men know by the name of Yeshua. Jesus said, \"I am the living water.\" Note Mem is 90, and so is 7%. Thus Yeshua stilled the waters (seas), for he knew that Adonai Melek (1 55) is Lord of the Waters. see C.7, 155,36, & 89 11. The Son is one with the Father, and the King is one with the Seas, and the Man is the symbol of the division of the Seas. For (Ben) and Nm (Aima) are both 52, and 7% (Melek), is like (Mem, 90) while (Adam) is 45, the half of division of 90. These are the names of Tiphareth. See that Melek and Adam are really the same even in number, for though 45 is the half of 90, 4 and 5 total 9. Furthermore the extension of 9 is 45. Thus Adam and Melek are essentially one, but since Melek is 90, the number of Mem, the Seas, the King, like the Son, is one with the Mother, for Aima is also the root of water, and that is the root of Mem. Aima is named also the great Sea and in this does the royalty of the King have its root. He is one with the Kingdom or Bride, and one with the Mother. Key 12, associated with Mem, the Seas, shows the hanged or suspended Adam, thus is his head surrounded with the glory of the sphere of the Sun. He is the Melek or King, and his power to rule is the consequence of his utter dependence on what supports him - which is the power at the center corresponding to the letter Tav. Again both Melek and Mern are related to the letter Tzaddi by the number 90. Tzaddi in the Tarot is the Mother unveiling herself to those who succeed in meditation, as did our Father Abraham according to the Book of Formation. See 45,52,434,400 & C. 19. Ill.

Enosh, ItttiN (mankind, 357), is the state of the Sons of God when they suppose themselves to be merely the Sons of Adam, and the return is to the original Angelic condition. In this is the deepest mystery of Saturn closely related to the secret of Mars. The Sons of Adam have forgotten that they are truly Sons of God. For them there is no rest, and in diverse ways they seek relief from the intolerable tension that is produced by the sense of separateness. Only a few members of the human race realize their true status, and live accordingly. The rest are turned to destruction until utter collapse of their supposed autonomy sends them back. Now these deluded ones see death everywhere, are taught survival perhaps, but do not usually really believe it. Thus they seek vicarious immortality in posterity, and surrender themselves to death. They who have come into the peace of the Sabbath are free from this delusion, and know better than to prolong the chain of birth and death. See 31. PX~ you angels of his, angles-of-him.

The first decanate of Taurus, ruled by Venus has the qualities of devoted, artistic, sympathetic. The influence of the demon suggest conscious imbalance resulting in the opposite negative qualities.

The purpose of human life is to enjoy a \"good time.\" The secret of happiness is in the honest development of our own gifts. We are given the seeds of mental imagery. It is up to us to develop them so that Adam can return to the Garden of Eden. see 703, 179, 129,53. The Stone is the Garden, and the Garden is the place of delight. That is, 7% (eben) is 12 (gan), and ff is f'lp, because the Stone is the union of the Son with the Father. Since eben and gan are both 53, the Stone is the Stone of Eden, as is the Garden. Eden means deli ht, or pleasure. Its 3 number is 124 or 4 x 31 or N multiplied by 4. Four is Daleth, this is the development of the power in Chesed (4' Sephiroth) to which ?Jw is the Divine Name. Daleth is Venus, thus the power of Daleth, which is the power of Netzach or Nogah (the sphere of Venus), is what multiplies the strength of Chesed into delight. The stone and the Garden are one, and as the Stone is the union of Chokmah and Tiphareth. So is the Garden in that same union; and from union comes delight. Never is there delight in separateness. Only when Father and Son are united is there delight. Gun (garden, 12) is the sign of this union. Because Gimel (f) is the Uniting Intelligence, which links Kether the Crown to Tipareth the Sun. Nun is the Imaginative Intelligence, which unites Tiphareth to Netzach. Gimel is Key 2, the Moon and Nun is Key 13, Mars in Scorpio. In Tarot they add to 15, which is the sign of the Ayin, the Renewing Intelligence that links Tiphareth to Hod. In Tarot, 15 is the Adversary, but he is more than this. His number is the same as V (Divine Name in Chokmah) and m, (the name of the 8\" Sephiroth). Ayin is the 26th Path and has the same number of Tetragrammaton, which is the special name of Tiphareth. He is the Life in Chokmah, and Adam, the King, in Tiphareth, and he is also the Splendor of the Mercurial Work. Thus the letters of ayden, begins with the Renewing Intelligence, followed by Daleth, the Luminous Intelligence which links Chokmah to Binah.

Meditation is the process. it is the physiological demonstration of a see-idea.\" Passion purified (Key 8) becomes compassion. see 6 1,63. The alchemists say the Magnum Opus is \"woman's work,\" and even our speech uses the words \"travail\" and \"labor\" for birth. This Work does not have to do with genetics. It is by a second birth within the heart. The force that is used is the Scorpio power; but in each human personality, for flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom, nor can it be transmitted by genetic processes to posterity. Never will the race evolve into the 5th Kingdom. Every person must transmute his own lead into gold. Evolution is a genetic process. The Magnum Opus goes beyond this. The Great Work transmutes the Microcosm into the Macrocosm. The Microcosm is illusory. It does not exist. Cosmic consciousness is truly Nirvana, or extinction. Thus the Great Work brings us to the place of God at the Center, that is, Tiphareth - in heart, not in head. Thus in all alchemical transmutation the genetic process is inhibited, as one may see from all texts of alchemy, magic and yoga. There is no more oft-repeated statement than this. Thus all the Rosicrucians of the first circle were \"bachelors of vowed virginity.\" Remember that the Sons of the Doctrine are never to be so much suspected as when they write most openly. Remember also, that they said also that some of them had children to whom they could not pass on their mysteries. Evidently \"vowed virginity\" is not simply celibacy, or else priests and nuns would also be adepts, and they are not. Understand that if the Scorpio force is used for generation it cannot be used for the Great Work. Used it may be, in several ways; but whatever the special regimen, it always excludes physical procreation. In Tibet this is well-known, as it is in the Western School. The objective is the new birth as one of the Sons of the Doctrine. Meditation is the process. It is the physiological demonstration of a seed-idea, and the names D%, fa 750 are the statement of that idea."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"See C.13. Omnipotens (Lt).

It may be read as perpetual generation (Nun), the fountain or renewal (Ayin) in (Beth) Daleth. I. Upward on the Tree runs the Way of Return. It begins in Guph, and rises to Nephesh through the path of Tav. This path is named neobed, Administrative and its number is 126, and it has close connection with the symbols of the R.C. For 126 is the total length (in feet) of the boundaries of the Vault described in Fama Fraternitatis. The Path of Tav is also closely related to all temple symbolism. The word neobed also calls attention to Mars in Scorpio (I), and Mars combined with Saturn@), and these are combined with the letters of Mercury (3) and Venus ('1). Mars in Scorpio, Mars exalted in Capricorn, Saturn ruling Capricorn - these are Nun and Ayin. Mercury is Beth, and Venus is Daleth. Meditate on this, and find out what you have to administer in the Temple of the Body. See C. 10. 11. The 32nd Path is 77y2 (Saykel Naobed, 197"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Intelligence of Service or Serving), and that it is so called because it governs the motion of the 7 planets and concurs therein to Tav, the letter of this Path, to which the wise declare that the Temple of the Midst pertains, and that this Path is also that of Shabbathai or rest. Neobed answers to the number 126, and so does 33~5~ (Almanah), or Widow. This refers to Malkuth in her separation from Tiphareth. Thus does the Path of Tav end in Malkuth, but its first letter is the beginning and end of Tiphareth. Its last letter is Vav, assigned to Tiphareth. The Temple of Holiness in the Midst is in the heart of the 6, and there is the place of rest, or Shabbathai. From Shabbathai came forth the other planets, and unto Shabbathai they all returned. In neobed that the first letter pertains to Madim (Mars), and to the perpetuation of life by generation. The 2& letter is the Fountain of Renewal in which Shabbathai rules and Madim has its chief power. Then Beth, and Daleth, so that you may read it as: Perpetual Generation, the Fountain of Renewal In Daleth, for Beth and Daleth together may be read \"in Daleth.\". In describing the vault, its boundaries as given in the Fama total 126. There are 7 lines of 5 feet at the top, 7 of 5 feet at the bottom, and 7 vertical lines of 8 feet, and this totals 126 feet. Note that 21 lines establish these boundaries, and 126 is a 6 x 21. It is then ?!'?% multiplied by Vav, the letter of Tiphareth to which the vault is assigned. The reference to 7lffJ and 3305~ (widow) may seem obscure at first; the riddle solves itself with a little meditation. The Path of Tav calls for a total reorientation to the Spiritual East. East is connected with Venus and the Secret Wisdom. Your personal reorientation and your personal victory, are also a work of Venus. Furthermore the dancer on Key 21 is androgyny, see if you can think through to its meaning, remember that the key stands for Shabbathai, and Saturn. The wreath in Key 21 is an ellipse or a zero sign representing 1% (not), 'IN, that is I, myself, and fw, the womb. Key is 21, has the value of m, the Divine name of Kether, and 'I;P, or Yaho, whose permutations establishes the Cube of Space (see Sephir Yetzirah). The Great Work is both personal and social, but it must begin with people. As they achieve it, as they enter the sanctuary, as they discover for themselves the true secret of Saturn, they progress stage by stage into conscious participation in the New Order. This has gone on for many generations. Since you do not know how many have already achieved the Summum Bonum, it may seem to you it is still far off. On the contrary, it is imminent. See C.36, 474, 61. 33~5~ almahnah. a widow, a desolate place. Said to refer to the \"Fall\" of Malkuth, the Bride in her separation from the Son, Tiphareth.

The Widow refers to Malkuth in her separation from Tiphareth. see 496, 52,306,432. I. But the Widow, is also the Bride, and one with the Mother. In Mizraim was she known as Isis, and her son was Khoor, whom the Greeks called Horus. Horus is 12, the Son who is Tiphareth, and his mother Isis is Binah. It is written \"out of Egypt have I called my son,\" and that son is Ben or Tiphareth. The mystery of Widowhood which separates the Bride from the Son, is a mystery of Motherhood, because the Bride and Mother are one. 11. Almahnah first two letters are ?N, the Divine Name is in Chesed, The next letters Mem and Nun reveal the hidden Manna. The last letter Heh, signifies sight, and is also the special letter in Tetragrammaton (WP) pertaining both to the Mother and the Bride. The Mother is the sphere of Shabbathai, or Rest, and the letter of Tav is Shabbathai itself.

Its outcome makes evident the truth that the mineral waters and the chemical stone are the microcosm. That is the true Adam who is Ben the Son.

The 2oth Tunnel is under the aegis of Yamatu, his number, 131, is the number of Samael, a name of Satan or Set as Guardian of the Threshold. It is also the number of Pan and of Baphomet, the idol adored of the Templars. 8'1732, meaning 'her foundation or fundament', a symbol of the kteis, also adds to 13 1, as well as )?=. Note that 131 + 535 (the number of kteis) = 666, the number of the Beast. This is confirmed by the fact that ftm, the son [i.e. Set] of Typhon, also adds up to 13 1. The sigil of Yamatu is a secret cypher of Set. It exhibits the inverted cross which signifies the downward passage or crossing into Amenta. The astro-glyph of the 20Ih Path is Virgo, and its threshold is the kteis of the Virgin guarded by Samael. Its magical formula is that of 'virile force reserved' i.e. Karezza, which comports a build-up of sexual energy for magical purposes but without final release. This is a perfectly legitimate magical formula and one which may be used in connection with the formula described in connection with the previous kala. Immortality in the flesh is one of the aims of the Black Brothers. The idea arose not only from the natural urge to protect the ego from the impact of death, with its consequent disruption of conscious identity, but also from a mis- interpretation of the doctrine of the Death Posture exemplified by the Cult of the Mummy in ancient Khem. In this connection, Michael Bertiaux - writing on Astral Machines -refers to magicians who endeavoured to achieve immorality on the astral plane. He observes: Instruments like this [an 'the Astral Condenser'] insulate against the changes of time, and it has been known that such instruments have been used by occultists to preserve themselves, or hold themselves on the astral plane against the onward tide of evolution. The Theosophist Leadbeater deplored this practice as a form of black magic. It is a typical example of the magic favored by occultists who habitually haunt the Tunnel of Yamatu. Narcissus, the flower ascribed to this tunnel, yields a key to the nature of the formula of sexual magick associated with it, which, in its dark aspect reflects Karezza as a sterile spending of magical force. This is confirmed by the letter Yod being regarded as sacred to Yamatu. Yod means a 'hand' and to this tunnel qabalists ascribe the Order of Qliphoth known as the Tzaphiriron, meaning 'The Scratchers'. The Light, or secret seed, concealed within the body suggests the idea of invisibility and this is the magical siddhi attributed to this ray, as also is parthenogenesis [ the Virgo-Virgin symbolism]. The work of the Black Brothers thus belongs naturally in the Tunnel of Yamatu where the seed, spilt in a sterile act, renders the body bereft of light and therefore 'invisible'. It was the object of the New Light Sect to retain the light within, thus defying death and achieving immortality in the flesh. The deity ascribed to this ray is Hoor-paar-Kraat, the Egyptian original of the Greek god of Silence and Strength [i.e. latent sexuality], Harpocrates. He was frequently depicted on the monuments as a child squatting upon a lotus with thumb or forefinger (both emblems of the phallus) pressed against its lips in the mudra of 'not uttering a word'. The Tarot Trump attributed to this ray is that of the Hermit who carries the lamp and staff symbolic of the hidden light, or the light expressed in darkness. He is the Magus of the Voice of Power, but in his qliphotic reflex he becomes the utterer of the Word of Death imprisoned in the corpse and not permitted to realize its identity with Space (cosmic consciousness). To be trapped in this tunnel is to suffer the death in life of petrifaction. The typical disease is paralysis, and the inclusion of 'all anaphrodisiacs' among the list of Vegetable Drugs ascribed to 206"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"this ray again suggests the anti-vital nature of its sterilizing influences.

Victory, eminence; juice of grapes, to shine; eternity [l Chron. 29:ll and Isaiah 25:8]. Seventh Sephirah. Overcoming ignorance. Opposite and complement of Hod. The original signification of this noun is brightness, clarity. Sometimes translated as splendor, glory, sincerity or truth. Occasionally it has the connotation of perpetuity or everlastingness. Often it conveys the idea of completeness or perfection, its use in this sense being comparable to the English \"clear,\" which has the same basic meaning of brightness. The most usual meaning of Netzach is Victory. In 1 Chronicles, 29: 1 1, in that Prayer of David which is a brief summary of the main points on the Tree of Life. In Isaiah 25:8 Netzach is translated victory. \"He will swallow up death in victory.\" Furthermore, the pronoun \"He\" in this passage refers to Jehovah Tzabaoth, the Lord of Hosts, specially assigned to Netzach in Qabalah. As the Occult or Hidden Intelligence it suggests the idea that the one life is a power that is perfectly successful and cannot fail, as a whole or in any detail. The victory for man has to do with the control and direction of reproductive (Mars) force, by the practice of meditation and then applied to definite forms of cultural activity transforming appearances of failure into evidences of victory, by control of desires, conserving physical energy and supplying the bloodstream with strength to manifest the higher powers. Tzaddi = Fishhook, that which lifts the fish, Nun, from the water, raises the reproductive power from subconsciousness to self- consciousness-meditation. Cheth = field, enclosed by a fence; limitation of a specific area for purposes of cultivation. Ojas, literally \"the illuminating, the brilliant\" is the root meaning of Netzach. Ojas is \"the highest form of energy attained by a constant practice of continence and purity. see 710, 525, 93, 64 and True and Invisible Rosicrucian Order, Cpp.203-2 121.

The three measures may be understood to be the three Sephiroth immediately below Tiphareth on the Tree. These three are the seats of the principles of personal consciousness, and it is they which must receive the \"leaven\" which comes from above. see Genesis 18:6, 656 (Greek), 507, 13 79, 889, 19 19, 1969.

That 'good news' has for its essential principle the idea represented by the name Jesus, which means 'the nature of reality is to set free'. Jesus and Joshua are two forms of the same name, and the Old Testament tells us that Joshua, who succeeded Moses as leader of the children of Israel, was the son of Nun. That is, his father's name was the same as the name of the letter connected by Qabalists with the sign Scorpio. Just as the leadership of Joshua follows that of Moses, so does the fulfillment of the ancient law by Jesus succeed its earlier manifestations of sacrifice. similarly, after preliminary purifications of yoga and alchemy (The yoke of the Law, [see 1131) comes the liberation of the good news which is heard by the initiate through the transmutation of the Scorpio energies. Thus the Rosicrucian allegory tells us that when brother C.R.C. had overcome the feebleness of his body during his stay of Damascus [444] he heard of the wise men at Damcar [264], went to their temple, and received from them good news, not only as to the significance of events that had happened while he was yet in the closter of the sense-life, but also concerning the true meaning of the world of nature. This good news is associated with the eagle, as a symbol of the regenerated activities of the Scorpio force, connected with the element of water, always a symbol of purification. Hence we find the alchemist directing their pupils to wash the matter many times, and then, say they, the great wonder will appear to you. Similarly, when this purification is accomplished we have borrowed strength from the eagle, and have eyes with which to see and recognize the great truth that every thing in our environment works for liberty, and not for human bondage.\" [Case, 1985, p. 125.1 see 326, 106,700, 50."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"The perimeter of a right angle triangle whose sides are 39, 52 and 65 and the area of 104.

This is a special spelling of the adjective for stable, using two Yods instead of the one which appears in the commoner spelling PP. Thus the basic meaning of qayam is found in its feminine verbal root signifying: to rise up, raising, erection. The secondary sense includes such ideas as \"to stand out, to endure, to confirm, to establish,\" and it is from these that the adjective which designates the path of Mem is taken. see 150, 5 10, 650, 90 and Key I2 (The Stable Intelligence). fZ3'EfN Antimony [Rabbinical Hebrew]. Metal of the earth. Perhaps the reason for Basil Valentine's emphasis on Antimony in his alchemical writings.

Silver refers to the reflective, mirroring power of subconsciousness. By means of this may be perceived the basic truth that \"I\" and \"The God of my Father\" are only two different ways of saying the same thing. Kehseph refers also to the idea or reversal, associated with Key 12, because silver is reflecting and reversed what it mirrors (as does water). 1.

Cain; a lance or spear, that which is pointed. Name of the first murderer. Refers to the false crown of will-power (Key 16) that is shattered by divine illumination.

Since this form of worship reflects a lack of self-knowledge, it is rejected. This drama is at the core of human experience. We are told that Christ is within, or that there is an Atman, immortally soul or essence within us. Instead of plunging into that living life, what do we do? We worship a picture of what we supposes it is, which cannot be but a projection of its shell or container. [Suraes, 1992, p. 137.1 [Then] Qaheen understands its message. He becomes the container of timeless life; and, as such, he goes toward Hevel-man conditioned according to his time and location-and speaks to him, although their separation has already taken place. But Hevel cannot understand; he cannot even hear Qaheen's parable, and he dissolves into what he essentially is: a bladder of blood. This blood is drunk by the female, earth. The text does not say that Qaheen slays Hevel: it says that he is yaqam, meaning elevated, raised, exalted above him. So YHWH and Qaheen look for Hevel and do not find him. There is only that pool of blood, which Adamah [50] the enormous female-to-be- conquered, is drinking. And it is the curse of this female which is upon Qaheen. It is preposterous to think that he is cursed by 'God'. On the contrary, it is written: Therefore, whosoever slays Cain, vengeance (of IHVH) shall be taken on him sevenfold [Genesis 4:15].

During all this time, while \"Cain\" (misinterpreted) is forever cursed by mankind's unending fratricide, Qaheen, who cannot prevent Hevel being killed by his own conditioning, is in deepest mourning in the land of Nod (Nod means sorrow.) This land is east of Eden, there where the tree of life is. This \"land of Nod\" is none other than the Land of Yod, where the N is brought to life in N (50): $11 [Nod] instead of 7' [Y od] . It is not surprising that for the conditioned mind Cain is a killer, whereas he is the very action of IHVH.\" [ibid, 1992, pp. 140-141 .] see 37. 5&%1'1 Niantiel. The Sentinel of the 24th Path (Tunnel) of Nun on the Inverse Tree of Life. I. The 24th Tunnel is under the influence of Scorpio and sentinelled by Niantiel whose number is 160. (160), the 'nucleus of impurity' mentioned in connection with the previous tunnel. It is also the number of 7015, 'for a drink offering', which indicates the sacrament associated with the formula of Niantiel. But a lesser or subsidiary formula is implied by the name )?la (160), which means 'to restrain' or 'keep back', implying the technique of Karezza. Other relevant concepts are Otz, 'tree', the Tree of Life, and PF, a 'setter up', from the Egyptian Khem, meaning 'ithyphallic'; also 98', 'he shone forth', from the Egyptian AJ which denotes the sun in the lower hemisphere. This idea is confirmed by the verse from 231 which reads: Also Asar was hidden in Amenti; and the Lords of Time swept him with the sickle of death. The Lords of Time are represented in the tunnel of Niantiel by the infernal waters of Scorpio which imply the alchemical formula of purification via putrefaction. The 'infernal waters' are the 'nucleus of impurity.' They suggest the symbolism of the rainbow as the seal of the deluge from the abyss of space. 160 is that of ah, 'an image', and this is depicted in the sigil of Niantiel as an image of Death with a five-rayed crown bearing a cross-handled scythe beside the Cross of Set. It is an image of death because the water of purification is the blood that negates life in manifestation, while at the same time affirming it in the Abyss where the blood is sucked PI', 1601 in as a 'drink offering' The five-rayed crown is the circle or cycle of the five kalas typical of the feminine phase of Negation: the lunar period that eclipses 'life' in the form of '5 [160], which means literally 'flakes of flesh'. The symbol of Pente, Five, and of the Pentagram as the Seal or Star of Nuit (Not), has been explained in The Magical Revival. The animals prowing in the shadows of this tunnel include the wolf and hound. This is the hound Cerberus who guards the Abyss. He is the 'great Beast of Hell ... not of Tiphereth without, but Tiphereth within' meaning the infernal sun in Amenta, the phallus in anus [unnatural congress] as distinct from the supernal sun. Also ascribed to this 24th kala are the scorpion and the beetle, both symbols of the Dark Sun. The typical disease connected with Path 24 is cancer, which links up with the beetle symbolism which preceded that of the crab as the sign of the midnight sun, the traverser of the backward path in the widdershins world of the Abyss. The god-forms appropriate are Typhon, Apep, Khephra, the Merti Goddesses [i.e. the goddesses of death], and Sekhet, the sun of sexual heat, the 'savage' sun in the south as opposed to the great Cat-headed Goddess, Bast, the 'gentle' mother of the north. In The Book of Thoth, Atu 13 is attributed to this ray and its title is Lord of the Gate of Death. Necrophilia also belongs here as that aspect of meditation on Dissolution that leads the adept to the portal of the Ultimate Mystery of Non-Being. The specifically sexual nature of the formula is made apparent in the attribution to this tunnel of the energies of Scorpio which rule the genital chakras. In a marginal note in his personal copy of Liber 777, Crowley wrote: 'In the New Aeon, Scorpio is the Woman-Serpent'. This means that the initiator of the adept is hidden in the image of Death with a five-rayed crown [i.e. woman] the symbolism of which has already been explained 235"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"in connection with the feminine number, five. In the African pantheon, the goddess of the rainbow, Aidowedo, pertains to this current. Here, however, the bow is not manifest but latent in the depth of the abyss. The opposite and fructive formula is where the rainbow appears in its full splendor in the heaven of Nu. But here, in the hell of Hecate all is dark, and the serpent Dangbe - the Black Snake - leaves in its wake a trail of slime that indicates the presence of the Necheshtheron, the Brazen Serpents, that haunt the tunnel of Niantiel. Since the Mysteries of Death concern the 24th kala it is necessary to understand the kind of magic practiced by the Atlanteans of the Black Temple. It is well known to occultists that at the moment of sexual orgasm the Adept is able to launch a creative thought-construct which penetrates the astral envelope of his psyche and reifies in matter at a time appointed by the magician. A similar mechanism operates at the moment of death. When the soul quits its earthly vehicle, the Adept of the Death Cult can direct it to any given location. A black magician could be this means capture the soul of individual and make it subservient to his will. This is the method of creating zombies. But the original Atlantean version of this sorcery involved elements of sexual magick. A consecrated priestess was slain in a special manner and the Adept copulated with her shade to produce a zombie on the astral plane. This was also, if required, incarnated via a living woman through the natural process of birth. The zombie produced in this way was not a soulless mechanism - as in the case of a zombie produced by Haitian Voodoo - but a highly intelligent though automatic entity combining the vividness and plasticity of astral consciousness with the magical qualities of the Adept himself. It was literally a child of the dead, yet equipped with magical powers and with all the faculties of humanity except that of the Will. Bertiaux correctly observes: 'Voudou and witchcraft' came 'from the same mystical parent, i.e. the old religions of Atlantis'. This highly complex 24th kala comports therefore various kinds of sexual magick. For the sake of convenience the elements involved are all related to the backward path of the Sun in Amenta; to the formula of Scorpio (purification via putrefaction); or to the necromantic and necrophiliac sorcery associated with the Mystere du Zombeeisme and the Cult of the Dead; and to the retention of the sun-seed in the practice of Karezza. It is therefore not surprising that to the path, of which Niantiel's cell is the tunnel are attributed lamiae, stryges, and witches.

In Isaiah it refers to Tetragrammaton of Host [mar m] as a sanctuary. In the New Testament [I Peter 2:8], the \"stone of stumbling\" is identified with the foundation stone which is the pinnacle stone. It is the identification of the son with the father. This is the basic meaning of Key 14. All tests and trials afford experimental evidence of this identity. The stumbling-block to right thinking about this one identity is to be sought in misinterpretations of sense-experience. I. Isaiah 8:14: \"and he will be a sanctuary; but for both houses of Israel he will a stone that causes men to stumble and a rock tham makes them fall.. .\" 11. \"Corporeal Intelligence is the aggregate cell- consciousness of the physical body.

This is directly related to the meaning of the letter name Samekh, a tent peg (120). Misunderstanding of the function of the corporeal intelligence is a great cause of error, which has its roots in a misconception of the significance of \"place\" or \"locality,\" and of the true inwardness of what seems to be increase or addition. As Jacob said, \"surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not.\" Body- consciousness is the Life-power self-knowledge of form. In Exodus 2 1 : 13: \"And if a man lie not in wait, but God's deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.\" See 1 Kings 8:30. I. Maqom a place, is a reference that the great work has definite location in time and space. It is the utilization of an energy which is out of time- space. It is by bringing the powers of that which is now the unknown, into specific, localized expression that adeptship is attained. But few there be who do not stumble over this 'stone' of material existence, and even the builders have sometimes rejected it. [Paul Case, unpublished notes] 11. The Book of Concealed Mystery: \"the balance hangs in the PP ([place]-a place on which something stands or exist, a location) which is 1% (not).\" 111. Note that by this is hinted that maqom = Ain (61). This is the same as what St. Peter is reported as saying in the Cleminine Homilies: \"The place of God is that-which-is-not.\" Ain is the unmanifest point or the center. [see Isaac Myer, The Qabalah, p.1183 Itself is a needle. Jesus said that is was easier for a rich man [i.e. materialistically inclined) man to enter the kingdom of heaven than for a camel (Gimel) to pass through the eye of a needle. The \"back of the head\" is like to Ain [see Book of Tokens]. The practice of habitual imagery through concentration to bring about body responsiveness to higher frequencies of light is hindered by the inertia of the \"monkey\" mind, which will not be still, but persistence brings results. 1Jt0'3 probation, trial, testing, proving by experiment.

In the life of Jesus the crucifixion was the final, inevitable experiment, whereby the truth of his doctrine was verified. But here is a still deeper meaning, because it is actually in the skull of man that the final stage of the Great Work is completed. \"Gr. kranion, Heb. golgotha, Lat. clavaria, Eng. \"skull.\" The 'crucifixion' takes place in the brain. The Fire, or electric force, rises to the vertex of the skull, where is the opening called mystically the 'door of lesous' (thum tou lesou); at the highest centre in the brain, called the 'third eye' (the conariun~ of the anatomists), it is intersected by the Water, or magnetic force, forming a cross in the brain. The strain of the two forces at the point of intersection throws out a spiral, which coils about the head. The physical body is then in a deep trance, seemingly dead, and the consciousness is in the sidereal body. The man is thus 'born form above', 'born of Water and of Breath,' but this is possible only for the purified ascetic who has reached the androgynous state and is thus 'self-born' (monogenes). This noetic action in the brain of the seer is expressed by the symbol O ; that of ordinary man being [circle with cross without top + bar] and of the woman [circle with cross without bottom + bar]. In this sacred trance the light about the head has the appearance of a sun; hence the aureole and cross shown about the head of lesus. The \"thorny crown', of a golden color, represents the radiation of the fire; and the 'purple mantle', the hue without the radiance (doxa) takes from the magnetic force or water ... the 'crucifixion' is an allegory of spiritual regeneration, not an historical record of a physical death.\" [Pryse, 1967, p. 200.1 EWOL. ~nnia (Gr).

Would he not rather have said that he would diminishes the number, by rendering them more and more painful and laborious? But the Hebraic text is as clear as the day. There is strong evidence that the Hellenist only abandoned it to follow the Samaritan version, because they plainly saw that it exposed the spiritual meaning, as indeed it does. For, which it is in accordance with reason and experience, to think that the volitive conceptions increase in proportion to the obstacles which are opposed to their realization and which force them to be divided, it is absurd and contradictory to affirm it of the pregnancies of physical woman which are necessarily diminished with the pains, maladies and suffering which accompany and follow them.\" [d'olivet, 1976, pp. 1 1 1 - 1 13 .] 11.

So long as will was exercised only in the spiritual realm it was free and efficient. Whatever was willed in ipso facto realized. In spirit every one is free. We can think, feel, create mentally, anything we wish, and no earthly power can prevent us. But when we try to realize our conceptions in the physical realm and have to adapt ourselves to physical conditions, we are at once hedged about with obstacles and difficulties of a thousand kinds, and many of our conceptions prove to be absolutely impossible of realization.

In Blavatsky's Secret Doctrine (1 st Ed. volume 3, p.467) it says: \"In the philosophumena we read that Simon [magus] compared the aeons [divine emanations] to the 'Tree of Life'. Said Simon in the Revelation: \"It is written that here are two ramifications of the universal aeons, having neither beginning nor end, issued both from the same root, the invisible and incomprehensible potentiality. One of these (series of aeons) appears from above. This is the great potency, universal mind [or divine ideation...]; it orders all things and is male. The other is from below, for it is the great (manifested) thought, the female aeon, generating all things. These two (kinds of aeons) corresponding with each other, have conjunction and manifest the middle distance (the intermediate sphere of plane), the incomprehensible air which has neither beginning nor end.\" This female 'air' is our ether, or the Kabalistic Astral light.\" Thus the masculine and feminine meanings of the word are reconciled. 31=!T the chariot.

A young man is the type of the Son who comes forth from Kether through the path of Gimel. He is the personifications of that Son the Egyptian Osiris, of whom it was said: \"He is a black god\" The face of the Son is black because the Son (fa) is one with the Mother (m*), because mother and son are both 52.

IRAK is ' (earth, Yod in a earth sign Virgo), 'I (The Sun, or solar fire), N (Air) and 3 (Jupiter, the god of rain and Water).

The 26Ih Tunnel is under the aegis of A'ano'nin, whose number is 237. This tunnel underlies the 26th path which transmits the 16'~ kala in the series of microcosmic kalas commencing with the 11'\" path. The Cosmic power-zones constitute the ten sephiroth, Daath being not a kala in the strict sense of the term but a Gate of Ingress and Egress of Aiwass (78) via Kether. The 22 Paths are reflections in human consciousness of the power-zones of cosmic consciousness. The aeons may also be considered in relation to the cerebral centers in man, and the kalas in relation to the sexual centers. The psychosexual mechanism of the 16 kalas in humanity (8 in the female; 8 in the male) is reflected from the aeonic centres or cosmic power-zones into the cerebro-spinal fluid and endocrine system. The 16'~ kala, in a macrocosmic sense, is equated with Path 16, the Path of the Har or Child (Horus). He is born of the Goddess represented on Path 15 as The Star whose mystical emblem is the 1 lth zodiacal sign, Aquarius. The reflection of Horus in the 16'\" microcosmic kala, which is numbered 26, is The Devil, or Double, of Horus, i.e. Set. A perfect fusion and balance of forces in the macro and micro-cosms is thus attained in this 26\"' kala, which is ruled by the energies of Capricorn. The Goat is the astroglyph of the Scarlet Woman whose EYE (Ayin) is attributed to this path via the symbolism of Atu 15, The Devil. This ain, or eye, reaches its fullest extent in the name of the Sentinel of this tunnel, i.e. A'ano'nin. His number is 237, which is also that of Ur-He-Ka, the Magick Power of the Goddess mBW (Sefekh, 393). 237 is also the number of IERAOMI, 'to be a priest or priestess', which confirms the sacred nature of this number. The sigil of A'ano'nin shows the Ur-heka surmounted by the head of the priest and surrounded by the letters 1123, which add up to 272. This is the number of Aroa, 'Earth', and of Bor, 'to consume', 'to be beastly', 'brutish', etc. It is' also the number of Orb, meaning 'the evening', or an Arab, i.e. a person living in the West. The West is the place of Babalon. Her totem, the goat, is the glyph of earth in the west as the place of the setting sun. Obr, a metathesis of Orb denotes 'tears, 'myrrh-dropping', from the 288"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"Egyptian word abr, 'ambrosia, 'ointment', and from aft, meaning 'exuding', 'distilling'. The magical powers of Path 26 relate to the Witches Sabbath and the Evil Eye. The Evil Eye is the Eye of Night (i.e. the moon), and the ointment, unguent, or myrrh-dropping is the Vinum Sabbati prepared at sundown in the cauldron of the Scarlet Woman. Capricorn is the Secret Flame whereon the cauldron seethes, hence its connection with Vesta. The disease typical of this kala is priapism, and the animals sacred to it are the oyster, the goat, and the ass. The latter is the specific totem of the female and of the qliphoth associated with the Moon of Yesod, the Gamaliel or 'Obscene Ass'. The tunnel of A'ano'nin is haunted by satyrs, fauns, and panic demons, and the Order of Qliphoth associated with it is the Dagdqgiron, meaning 'the Fishy', which denotes the feminine nature. The corresponding Magical Weapon is the Secret Force represented by the shuttered lamp, which is an allusion to the eye concealed in the buttocks of the goat. The Tarotic attribution of this Path 26 is the trump entitled The Devil, The Lord of the Gates of Matter; for the lunar current is the menstruum of reification which seethes within the Cup of Babalon. She is the Bride of Choronzon for he is in truth Lord of the Gates of Matter. According to Liber 231: The Lord Khem arose, He who is holy among the highest, and set up his crowned staff for to redeem the universe.

Mention is also made of Ariel as an angel who assists Raphael in the cure of disease ... in the Coptic Pistis Sophia, Ariel is in charge of punishment in the lower world.,. In The Testament of Solomon he controls demons. In Gnostic lore generally, his is a ruler of winds and equated with Ialdabaoth as an older name for the God. In practical Cabala he is regarded as originally of the Order of virtues. According to John Dee ... Ariel is a conglomerate of Anael and Ure..

It was necessary then that Adam should be first formed in the spirit world, of spiritual 'human' elements, and then attracted to the physical plane to be 'formed' into physical individual men and women...

This important word is composed of two roots which usage has contracted, 113-31. the first 33, develops literally the idea of a thing placed or happening above another, as a boss, an eminence, a protuberance. Figuratively, it is an increase of glory, strength, honor. The second 113, contains the idea of distinction, of splendor, of purification. it must not be confused with the root word Nil3 to create. The latter is composed of the signs of interior action 1, and the elementary root %: the one now under consideration, unites to the same generative sign 3, the modified root 114 which, applied particularly tofire, develops all ideas attached to that element. It is from this that the following words are derived. 13, wheat, nil to elect, to choose, to distinguish; ma, that which is white and pure; Tin3 that which is selected, put aside, preferred, etc. Observe that vowel which constitutes this root, undergoing the degradation forms the verb llfta, to injlame, to fill with burning adore; to make passionate, Jirrious, etc. From this etymological knowledge, that the word By33 signifies very distinguished, very remarkable, very noble men. The first root 13, meaning very, and rendered by the ancient Greeks by unsp above. The second root 111, has been preserved in the plural Bopsot, Boreans: meaning, the illustrious, the powerful, the strong, in short, the Barons: for the Celtic word baron, is the analogue of the Hebrew 11732, written with the extensive final 11; the Greek word Ynsppopsot, is no other than the high, arch- barons. And thus, confusing constantly the name of a caste with the name of a people, as they have done with regard to the Chaldeans, these same savants have been greatly troubled to find the fixed abode of the hyperborean nation. The word 7713, here referred to, constitutes the fourth name that Moses gives to man: the second, that this hiergraphic writer, makes this superior man descend, by the union of divine emanations with natural forms, that is to say, in other terms, spiritual faculties joined to physical faculties. The element from which he must draw his passive nature substance, is named after him, Adamah. Soon the divine spirit is united to his elementary spirit; he passes from power into action. The being of beings individualizes him by detaching from him his efficient volitive faculty and makes him thus, free, susceptible of realizing his own conception. The intellectual man, pH, exists. The covetous passion, universal incentive of elementary nature, inevitably attacks thenceforth this volitive faculty, now isolated and free. Aisha, [306] seduced and believing to take forth this possession of his active nature principle, gives way to the natural principle. Intellectual man is corrupted. His volitive faculty is changed into elementary existence, Hetvah [Eve, 191. Universal man, Adam, is decomposed and divided.

The corporeal faculties succeed to elementary existence. Corporeal man, AEnosh, [357] appears upon the cosmogonic scene. In the meantime, the divine emanations are united to the corporeties born of the dissolution of Adam, and corporeal man gives place directly to superior man, Ghibor, [211], hero, demi-god. Very soon this Ghibor, this superior man, abandons himself to evil, and his inevitable downfall brings about the repose of Nature. Thus, in the profound thought of Moses, these four-hieroglyphic names succeed one another: Adam P'M, universal man, m, intellectual man, MIN, corporeal man, $I22 superior man.

The magical force is in the blood. It is called the flaming sword in the story of the fall of man, because that story refers to the descent of consciousness from higher and inner planes to the physical. The sword \"turns every way\" because it is the fire force in the blood-stream, circulating through our bodies, and therefore turning every direction. It keeps us out of Eden, for the time being, so that we may gain knowledge of the physical plane. Yet this same force in our blood is what we must learn to use in order to overcome the delusions which cause all our difficulties. Lawhat, (flaming) means 1'73 throat; neck [Crowley, 1977, p. 301.

Baratchial whose number is 260, which is also the number of Tiriel, the Intelligence of Mercury."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"We expect to find a very precise reflection and inversion of this entity in the depths of the abyss where the path becomes a tunnel transmitting infernal influences. And this we do in fact find, for 260 is also the number of -&, the 'con- cealed' or 'hidden', and of W2, 'a priest', not of the Light but of the Dark, for %2 means 'blackness', its root being the Egyptian Kam, 'black'. Although the 12' path is that of the Magician or Magus, the black or hidden priest should not be identified with the black magician, but with the Black Brother. This is the kala of the Sorcerers, the Monnim (260) who transmit the light direct from beyond Kether to Saturn via the formula of duality [Beth and both being synonymous, implying duality]. Duality is expressed zoomorphically by the twin serpents Od and Ob, and by the ape - the shadow of the Magus who, according to tradition, distorts and perverts the Word of the Magus thus making a mockery of his work, as do the Black Brothers with their formula of duality. This is evidenced by the symbols of Baratchial: two swords with inturned blades, suggesting intense concentration on the ego as opposed to the Self of All, flanking a ghostly face (mask) surmounted by a crescent moon. The sigil is a glyph of falsity and illusion reflected in the current of duality that reveals the Shadow of Thoth in the image of his ape or cynocephalus. This doctrine is expressed in the second verse of 231: The lightnings increased and the Lord Tahuti (i.e. Thoth) stood forth. The Voice came from the Silence. Then the One ran and returned. The One is Kether, and it returned to its own power-zone because the vibration of this kala is illusory and cannot transmit truth. Its vibration duplicates that of the previous kala, thus creating a mere simulacrum of the creative spirit. The Black Brother is double tongued, as the serpent, the magical power ascribed to the obverse aspect of which this path is the tunnel, is the Gift of Tongues, the Gift of Healing, and a Knowledge of Sciences. The healing here however is the healing of the ego, which merely aggravates with illusion the disease of false identity creating thereby a chain of endless suffering. Likewise, the Sciences of which knowledge is given are the sciences of darkness. Yet it must not be supposed that these are necessarily evil, it is merely that in the hands of a Black Brother they necessarily tend to sterility because directed towards the fulfillment of wholly personal ambitions. The dark sciences of this path contain the secrets of the kalas of the void. The witches and wizards of this tunnel speak with 'voices' that are reflected into the aura of the Adept by the mechanism of unnatural acoustics associated with the mysterious ventriloquism of Bath Kol, the Voice of the Oracle. The beth is the house or womb of the supreme kala, and of the source of that ventriloquism that was primal in the myths of man, for the Word was endowed with flesh and issued from the belly of the mother. Here again the number of Baratchial, 260, corroborates the doctrine of this path of beth for it is the number of f$?BID, 'pleasures', 'delights', and of 7'27, 'thy thighs', which reveals the sexual nature of these pleasures. The disease typical of this path is Ataxaphasia which here refers specifically to disorders of the faculty of speech, typified by the bestial howlings; or cachinnations of the prehuman creation and by that 'monstrous speech' (mentioned in Liber 7) that thrills beyond the veil of the void. The dangers attendant upon the use of this kala are extreme, yet the advantages that may be gained would seem to outweigh them in that the Adept is able to transcend the merely conceptual transmission of imagery. He is thus able to maneuver specific atavisms at a level deeper than those he could penetrate as a Magus. This is because the silence of the outer spaces, like the music of the spheres, may be apprehended only when the ape-like chattering of the Magician's vehicle [his senses] has been subdued by contact with the transcosmic forces that sweep through this tunnel from the pathways of the Great Inane. The latter is the Ain, or Void, the unwinking eye which emits invisible rays that reify within the innermost sanctuaries of the Adept's non-being. He then becomes The Magus ofpower [The title of the tarot trump equated with the obverse path] in a true and totally different sense to that in which this power has been understood in any previous aeon. For that power (shakti) is primal and does not exist apart from the shadow, the solidification of which is the entified Magus whose Word is but falsehood and glamour.

Tunnel 29 is under the influence of the moon and is the haunt of the witch typified by Hekt, the frog-headed goddess and Lady of Transformation. Qulielfi is the sentinel; her number is 266. The sigil shows 22 inverted lunar crescents; for Qulielfi represents the termination of the qliphoth of the 12 zodiacal signs. The central three crescents surmount a blind eye raying downward. This symbolism refers to the three viable days of the five-day lunar flow when the phallus turns a blind eye to the Eye of the Moon as she shreds her menstruum of astral creation. Hence the magical power attributed to this 29th kala is that of Casting lllusions and Bewitchments generally. As it is written: 'It is from the excrement of Choronzon that one takes the material for the creation of a God.' The title of the tarot trump ascribed to Path 29 is The Moon, its alternative title being the 'Ruler of Flux and Reflux', and the magic mirror is the sole item of equipment in the lunar temple when Qulielfi is evoked. The mirror denotes the crepuscular state of consciousness peculiar to some regions of the astral plane. It is in this state that successful astral working is achieved, for at the borderland of sleep and waking are the 'liers in wait' [The Tunnel of Qulielfi leads to the city of Chorazin and the liers-in-wait are the Qliphotic ring-pass-not without the City.

The number of Qulielfi confirms this symbolism for 266 is 70, meaning 'olla', 'a pot' or 'vase', a glyph of the vulva in its passive and solitary phase. But the formula of this tunnel comports another element that is by no means as passive. It is under the sign of the Frog, the transformer from the waters. This totem typifies the evolution of consciousness from the amphibious to the terrestrial state. The frog is the leaper or jumper, which implies a specific formula in connection with the 'other side' of the Tree of Life. In the Cult of the Black Snake this formula is referred to as that of the Voltiguers, the vaulters or leapers. Frater Achad who 'jumped' from Yesod to Binah by what he termed 'an unusual method', had recourse to the secret paths alluded to by Bertiaux. The deeper significance of Achad's magical leap from Yesod to Binah is resumed by the formula of the leapers as it applies to the tunnel of Qulielfi. It may now be understood in which sense the tunnel of Qulielfi is equated with the Magic Mirror, the 'twilight of the place', for the moon that illumines this tunnel is of Daath, not of Yesod. Hence, in Liber 231 we read: By her spells she invoked the Scarab, the Lord Kheph-Ra, so that the waters were cloven and the illusion of the towers was destroyed. Khep-Ra is literally the backside of Ra (the Sun), i.e. the Moon. The waters refer to M, the water of the Abyss. The towers are those of the Black or Dark Brothers. This points to a mystery concerning the true meaning of Black Magic, for the Dark Doctrine is that of the Dark Brothers who appear upon earth (i.e. on the hither side of the Tree of Life) as Black Magicians. Frater Achad himself approached very nearly to an under standing of this mystery of true Black Magic, but, like many occultists before and after him, he was blinded by assuming that Universe 'B' is 'evil' whereas it is - like Satan - merely the adversary of the sense of individuality that is generated in man by illusory egoidal consciousness. In Universe 'B' occurs the 'dissolution ... in the kisses Of Nu' (i.e. the waters of the Abyss) that Hadit promises.

The earlier twins, however, were Set and Anubis, the golden jackal who, with his 328"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"dark shade, haunted the desert of mummies, i.e. the astral shells left by those who had made the crossing and transcended the abyss. The sigil of Zamradiel is composed of a lunar crescent pierced by an arrow shot from a bow, both ends of which terminate in the letter G. The transfixed moon is the crucified flesh. The 'crucified' are those who have made the crossing of the Abyss. The letter G (gimel) signifies the 'camel', the ship of the desert, the vehicle by which the crossing is achieved. It is the letter of the High Priestess. This tunnel concentrates the influence of Set via the Black power-zone (Binah) that receives its light from the Stellar Sphere (Chokmah) and rays it downward through the abyss. The 17th kala is thus strongly charged with the atmos- phere of Daath and of Death, both of which have close affinity with the Lovers. The number 292 is also that of Chozzar which, as suggested in Cults of the Shadow, is probably connected with the name Choronzon, a corrupt form of it, The symbol of Chozzar resembles the astrological sign of Neptune and according to Blavatsky Chozzar is called Neptune by the uninitiated. It is the symbol of Atlantean Magic and its attribution to the second power-zone, Chokmah, is highly significant because Chokmah receives an influx direct from Pluto (Kether). This is the energy that powers the Lovers of the 17'h Path, but, in the tunnel beneath it, it has been transformed into the MBl (292, a drug and mW, a metathesis of MDl, means 'a young bird') or 'drug of death' that is represented by the black bird of Set and the black pig of Typhon. Chozzar means 'a pig'. This creature was adopted as a symbol of the Great Work by the Typhonians because it was the only animal known to devour human excrement. The pig is symbolic and so is the excrement, for it is not anal refuse that is veiled by this totem, but the blood of the moon, the human female flux in its dark phase. The symbolism was carried over into the solar cults of later ages, and at the time of the vernal equinox the god Khunsu is depicted in the orb of the full moon bearing in his arms the sacrificial pig. The imbibition of the black wine of the moon prepared the initiate for the disintegration, or crucifixion, at Easter time, and this made possible the crossing over into the world of spirit or Nonbeing. The Gnostics depicted Chozzar in the form of a Serpent whose stellar representative was Draco. The undulation of the serpent was an image of the periodic feminine flow. The mystery of this tunnel is glyphed by the sigil of its sentinel with the lunar crescent transfixed by the arrow. In Zarnradiel's sigil the moon is young and has not yet attained the fullness of gestation which occurs after the lovers have emerged from the City of the Pyramids (Binah) into the desert of Set. The relevant verse from 231 reads: Here then beneath the winged Eros is youth, delighting in the one and the other. He is Asar [Osiris] between Asi [Isis] and Nephthi (Nephthys]. Osiris is the mummy, the dead one who is reborn in the spirit world, having been conceived by Isis and brought to birth by Nephthys. The magical siddhi of this kala is - understandably -bilocation, here symbolized by the mummy (Osiris) and the risen youth (Asi). This dual deity sometimes appears as The Brothers and sometimes as The Lovers. It is from this tunnel that dark forces emerge and seep from the abysses of non-being, permeating the power-zones of manifestation with the shadows of their absence. This doubling or dappling with light and shade is typified by symbolic hybrids such as the magpie, the penguin, the piebald, the parrot, the zebra; in fact, all dappled and chameleon-like creatures that have the apparent power of transformation. The Order of Qliphoth ascribed to this realm is the Tzalalimiron, 'The Changers'. The supreme totem of this tunnel is the hyena and this realm is haunted by votaries of the Bultu, or Spectral Hyena. Its cult is known to have existed in the paleolithic age. It brought its totem out of Africa and spread it secretly, all over the earth. It had its astral source in the tunnel beneath the Path of the Twins (The Lovers) and was reflected on to the earth plane at a place in Afiica named Kabultiloa. The name means literally 'the shadow (Ka) of the specter or spirit (loa) of the hyena (bultu)'. This Cult of the Spectral Hyena persisted when all other forms of its god had perished, and certain magicians and dreamers have received 329"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"intimations of its existence through the centuries. Dr. John Dee and Aleister Crowley called it Choronzon, while H. P. Lovecraft sensed it as the monstrous and amorphous slime known as Yog-Sothoth [an amalgam of the god-names Set and Thoth]. According to a secret grimoire 'the Beast was called down not from known spaces but fiom cells between them [i.e. the Cells of the Qliphoth], while the bultu drums beat off-beat rhythms. Similarly, in the later Petro rites of Voodoo - in which the Cult survived under another name - 'the alignments of the secret vevers flowed between the cardinal points, not through them. The tunnel of Zamradiel is under the aegis of the forces of Shugal-Choronzon in their voodoo forms of Baron Samedhi and Guede-Nibho. The Baron represents the Saturnine aspect. Another of his names is Cimitirere, the place of the dead or of those who make the crossing into non-being. Hence, Baron Samedhi is also known as Maitre Carrefour or Carfax, Master of the Crossroads, for at the junction of the four Ways [The center of the cross represents the intersection of the plane of being and non-being.]. The spirits of the living cross over into the realm of non-being, and vice versa. The dual nature of the symbolism associated with Zamradiel accords with the nature of the Bultu which, being of another dimension, is neither flesh nor spectre, white nor black, human nor beast, but a combination of hybrid entities. The hyena is symbolic of all half lives, all twilight and crepuscular states of consciousness, all crossed breeds interweaving, coiling, worming their ambiguous images into flesh and branding with the mark of the Bultu the myriad forms it chooses as its vehicles. Primordial atavisms are unsealed by the beat of the Bultu drums and, if used in connection with the tunnel of Zamradiel. This accounts, in a phenomenal sense, for the 'ominous appearances' and 'banshees', the legendary beings ascribed to this path in Liber 777.

The void is sealed by the image of a black lunar crescent emitting streams of blood. This sigil resumes the ideas relating the magical siddhi of the 25th path, i.e. Transmutations and the Vision of the Universal Peacock. The peacock is a symbol of Shaitan and comports the rainbow symbolism previously explained, thus showing the feminine nature of the transforming fire of this kala. The number 280 is that of 81, meaning 'terror'. It is also the number of squares on the side of the Vault containing the body of Christian Rosencreutz in the Golden Dawn symbolism of the 5\" = 6\" Grade, which should be studied in connection with the symbolism of this tunnel. The relevant verse from Liber 231 reads: And a mighty angel appeared as a woman, pouring vials of woe upon the flames, lighting the pure stream with her brand of cursing. And the iniquity was very great. The Angel as the woman cursing represents the feminine current symbolized by Nephthys, the sister of Isis. Nephthys is the reifier or transmitter of perfection; the art of transforming raw (i.e. virgin) nature into the image of fulfillment or motherhood. The Order of Qliphoth associated with this process is the Nechashiron, or Snakey, and the Atu of Tahuti attributed to Kala 25 is appropriately entitled The Bringer Forth of Life. In the African pantheon, Aidowedo -the rainbow goddess - is the cognate deity. Her coming is likened to the lightning-flash. This is the Sagittarian influence manifesting in the form of the female current. 'Her fetish is a large serpent that appears only when it wants to drink. It then rests its tail on the ground and thrusts its mouth into the water. It is said that 'he who finds the excrement [menstrual] of this serpent is rich forever'. [Grant, 1994, pp. 226-227.1 Micah 6:10]. The secret alchemical fire is the entity with all things, and the foundation of all life and form. Aleph is the Life-breath or Spirit and Shin corresponds to the element fire and has the same numerical value as the \"Life-breath of the Creative Powers.\" Both Aleph and Shin are mother letters. see 53, 44, 444, 256, 471, 360, 300.

In a more restricted sense it is fire considered in the absence of every substance. The Hebraic genius confounds this root with the root PN, and considers in it all which is of the basis and foundation of things; that which is hidden in its principle; that which is absolute, strong, unalterable, as the appearance of fire.

Its anagram, ?la means 'to lighten', 'send lightning', as applied to the Great Serpent (of the Gnostics), from the Egyptian buiruka, meaning 'fulgurant', 'glittering'. A further metathesis, lap, signifies 'a cave', 'hole in the earth', 'tomb'. These three letters therefore constitute the type-name of a place of divination founded on the oracle of the womb. The sigil shows a Priest or King wearing a crown in the shape of a phallus with its 'eye' protruding. This is an image of the Great Serpent extended or 'flowering', its eye signifLing the dawning or opening power of the phallus. The Atu pertaining to Path 28 is that of The Emperor, who is also called 'Sun of the Morning and Chief among the Mighty'. In the Tunnel of Tzuflifu this dawn assumes an almost deliquescent state of heat that resembles a fluid fire-ball. The disease typical of Path 28 is apoplexy, and the demons which haunt the tunnel are the furies born of the blood of Uranus who was castrated for crimes against the ties of kinship. The furies (or Erinyes) are depicted in Greek myth as winged women girt with snakes, thus revealing their affinity with the lunar current. Uranus is the planet assigned to Daath, with its symbolism of reversion to the source of Non-Being, hence the crime of incest associated with this tunnel.

The Sentinel of the 23rd Path (Tunnel) of Mem on the Inverse Tree of Life. I. The 231d kala is under the dominion of Malkunofat who lies in the depth of the watery abyss. His number is 307 which is that of rm, a 'night demon' of the 2\"d decanate of Scorpio, and having therefore an essentially sexual reference. It is also the number of ~~15, meaning 'to sow', derived from the root m, 'semen'. There is in this number an element of panic terror exemplified in the word m, which means 'to make a noise', 'crash', 'be terrible'. It derives from the Egyptian word shefi, signifying 'terror, terrify', 'terrible' or 'demon-like'. It is the root of the name Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction. These ideas are apparent in the sigil which is in the form of a portrait of Malkunofat, with the letters I$IJ descending in that order beside a downward-pointing arrow. The key to this glyph lies in the number 61, which is the number of I$Il. 61 is Ain, meaning 'Not'. Ain is identical with Ayin, the yoni or eye of the void. According to Crowley, 61 is 'a number rather like 3 1'. 3 1 is ~5, 'Not', and h, 'God', thus identifying the Absolute with the Void. Ani, the ego, 61, is also void. 61 is the number of Kali, Goddess of Time and Dissolution. Her color is black, which equates her on the one hand with the void of space, and on the other with the symbolism of sexual magick typified by the blackness of gestation, the silence and darkness of the womb. Above all, 61 is the number of the 'Negative conceiving itself as a Positive'. This it does through the fa3 (Beten, 61) or womb of Kali. Beten derives from the Egyptian but, the determinative of which is the vagina sign. The womb is the nave or I$IJ (61) which in metathesis becomes fn, meaning 'wealth.' It pertains to the Goddess of the lunar serpent that appears only when it wishes to drink. It then rests its tail on the ground and thrusts its mouth into the water. It is said that 'he who finds the excrement of this serpent is rich forever' The excrement to which allusion is made is not anal, but menstrual. The formula of the sigil may be interpreted as the subjection of the womb or woman by Malkunofat for the purpose of acquiring wealth. The Atu corresponding to the Tunnel of Malkunofat is entitled 'The Hanged Man,' The Spirit of the Mighty Waters. This is indicated by the downward pointing arrow alongside the I$IJ, and it implies the light (or gold) in the Depths. Ibis symbolism accords with the magic siddhi attributed to Path 23, i.e. the power of skrying. The tunnel of Malkunofat is the abode of the Deep Ones, of which the Arch devil Leviathan is the generic symbol. The Sepher Yetzirah refers to Leviathan as Theli, the Dragon. Its number is 440 which is the number of ~35, 'placenta', or 'cakes', a reference to the excrement above"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"mentioned. It is also the number of Pn, meaning 'to come to an end', from the Egyptian atem, to annihilate. This is the dragon of darkness whose number is 5, being the formula of the female in her lunar and nocturnal form. Mathers calls attention to the fact that 'this dragon is said by the author of the Royal Valley to be the king of all the 'shells or 'demons', and he suggests comparison with the beast in Revelation. According to The Book of Concealed Mystery 'the serpent (i.e. Leviathan) came upon the woman, and formed in her a nucleus of impurity, in order that he might make the habitation evil. The nucleus of impurity is the substance of which water is the symbol. Water (i.e. blood) is the element attributed to the 23'd Path. It is this 'nucleus of impurity' which the Ade t tR gathers about him for the work of the next (24 ) kala. It should be understood that the term 'nucleus of impurity' is a legacy of the Old Aeon [The Aeon of Osiris of which the Judaistic cults, including Christianity, are the last remaining forms], when all that pertained to woman was considered unwholesome. In terms of physiology she was considered unclean, impure, and, in the moral sphere, 'evil'. The substance thus vilified was the water of life i.e. blood; and because its manifestation in the female determined the period of negation or non-openness to the male, it was execrated by an all-male regime as detestable, noisome, and wholly negative. In the New Aeon of Horus, however, this water is the menstruum of manifestation without which the phenomenal universe would be an impossibility. It is the means of incarnation as well as of magical reification, and as such it is the prime substance of all being, which is NOT (Nuit). This Mystery is of a mystical order and can be understood only when the nature of the Goddess is fathomed in its fullness. [Grant, 1994, pp. 216- 2 18.1 RW seach. thought meditation.

I. \"WN, intellectual man... Here is a new denomination given to man. It appears for the first time, when the Being of beings, having declared that it was not good for universal man, Adam, to live alone in the solitude of his universality, has effected his individuality, in giving him an auxiliary force, a companion, created in his light and destined to him to reflect his image. I beg the reader to remark first of all, that Moses giving a name to this companion, does not derive it from that of Adam; for Adam considered as universal man, could not know a companion. The Hebraic word a% has no feminine. The word YWM which appears to be it, does not signify universal woman, as one might think; but, the elementary principle of Adam. a%, universal man, posses the two sexes. Moses has taken care to repeat it several times so that one shall not be deceived. What therefore is this companion, this auxiliary force, as the word l!)? expresses it? It is the volitive faculty developed by the Being of beings: it is the intellectual woman of universal man; it is the will proper which individualizes him, and in which he is reflected and which, rendering him independent, becomes the creative force by means of which he realizes his conceptions, and makes them pass from power into action. For, this truth must come out from the darkness of the sanctuaries: the will was creator with universal man. Whatever this man willed was when and how it willed it. The power and the act were indivisible in his will. Such is the difference between and ttnN. The one characterizes man universalized by his homogeneous essence. The other designates man individualized the his efficient will. This name springs from two contracted roots m% ...% develops every idea of desire, of inclination, of appetite, of election: B'N is the power of movement, the elementary principle, fire, considered in the absence of these two roots only differs from the word &'!I#, which indicates natural, substantialized fire, by the median sign. In the former it is that of manifestation and duration: in the latter it is the bond between nothingness and being, which I name convertible. The one is a movement, intelligent, volitive, durable; the other, a movement, appetent, blind, fugacious. Here is the hieroglyphic meaning of the word ??W intellectual man. It is a new development of universal man, a development, which, without destroying his universality and his homogeneity, gives him, nevertheless, an independent individuality, and leaves him free to manifest himself in other and particular conceptions, by means of a companion, an auxiliary force, intended to reflect his image. It is therefore with profound reason that Moses having especially in mind, in this companion, the volitive faculty which constitutes universal man, intelligent-being, that is to say, the faculty which renders him capable of will and of choosing, draws its name from the same name of intellectual man, m. In this derivation, he as caused the sign of manifestation ', to disappear, and has replaced it with the final sign of life, in order to make it understood that it is not the volitive principle with resides in [woman], but the principant will, existing, no longer in power, but in action.\" [d'olivet, 1976, pp. 91- 93 .]"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"11. F.J. Mayers: Now let us study, somewhat in detail, this word Aish. The simple root \"N' denotes merely any 'desire', 'inclination', and way in which a being or individual seeks some 'self expression or reveals itself. The root 'Ash' denotes 'potential activity', 'power', 'force', 'directed energy'. Aish denotes all activity in which ones individuality is expressed. It is he manifestation of one's 'intelligent being'. This 'intelligent being', it is that gives man any real 'self to express, and makes him capable of conceiving ideas of his own; but to bring about the realization of the ideas one creates, something more than creative intelligence is required. That 'something' is the driving power of will, and will was what God 'built up' into a living, active force from its elemental germ, that had till then been lying dormant in the being of Adam. Now we can see the meaning of the name Aisha [see 3061. To the name Aish, one sign letter has been added, and one removed. The sign added is Heh the sign of 'Life', or movement towards some purpose or end. It has been referred to and explained may times ... Aisha is that which gives life and realizing power to Aish, but that transliterated Aisha is spelt Aleph-Yod- Shin-Heh, and pronounced Aish, but that transliterated Aisha, Aleph-Shin-Heh without the Yod, although the Yod sound is retained in pronunciation. It was omitted from the written word for heiroglypic purposes. Had it been retained, the word Aisha, would not have been simply a feminine of Aish, and would have denoted that Aisha was a separate 'intelligent being' or 'female intelligence'; but the omission of the Yod showed that Aisha was not a separate being but a faculty of the being of Adam.

The star in the Hermit's Lantern or the hexagram is a synthesis of the alchemical symbols for the 4 elements, and the letters of f'lm (1: Fire; 2: Air; '1: Earth, 3: water) represent these same four elements as phases in the manifestation of Light. One of the 4 occult maxims. The magical will is the radiant power of the Sun (Resh). It is something perceptible throughout nature (Tzaddi). He who learns by practice the art of true meditation becomes a powerful center of that Natural Intelligence. He who knows the one will goes through Life guided by the inner voice (Vav). The magical will is a power of development and dissolving power as well. It takes form in mental imagery (Nun). see 474, 13 1,70,701, 107,20. Translated grace in Lesser Holy Assembly (p. 102, 108, 1 10, 1 1 1 ) \"If this f 'lSl grace, be revealed, all those judgements are enlightened and are diverted from their concealed rigor.\" \"And when this head, which is concealed in the head of the ancient one, which is not known, extendeth a certain frontal formation, which is formed for brilliance, then flasheth forth the lighting of his brain.\" \"And is produceth and designeth (a certain effect) in this light (otherwise in this opening), in this forehead, whereon is inscribed a certain light, which is called f'lm, grace.\" \"And this grace is extended backward into the head, even unto that place where it can remain in the beard, and it is called the supernal, 7Oll Chesed, Mercy.\" Ruwtzone, meaning grace and good will is numerically the same as rnaqor (see below), meaning, something dug, a spring, a well and tzanir, meaning, a water-pipe, a canal or channel. Thus we see that will has to do with the transmission of occult Water from a primary source through a channel. In this connection one would be lead to the conclusion that Geburah, the seat of Will is a watery sephiroth. Note that the letters of rawtzone are composed of the 4 elements.

Note that three of these letters are related to fixed signs, and the Sun, Resh, rules the fixed fire sign of Leo. This is represented by the animals shown in the corners of Tarot Keys IOand 21.

The lapis lazuli was a very highly esteemed stone amongst the old world peoples, who called it 'the stone of heaven', the gem of the starsf, and the Zemech stone connected with all things heavenly. Traditionally it is the stone on which was engraved the law of Moses ... The connector of a blue stone with the blue heaven is consistent with ancient philosophy, and authorities agree in connecting this color with the sign of the mighty heavens ...

Note that in the wilderness Moses raised a serpent of brass on a Tau cross. Brass or Copper is related to Venus and the serpent power that enchanted Eve. Compare this to the story of C.R. whose brother PAL (754 Aleph, I 1 l),died at Cyprus (Kupros, Kpxoq), meaning copper, or magician.

I. In Genesis 3:l: Now the serpent was more subtle than all the wild beast that the Lord God had made. And the serpent said to the woman, 'truly has God said that you shall not eat of any tree of the Garden.' 11. d'Olivet translates: \"Now Nahash (egoism, envy, covetousness, concupiscence) was an insidious passion (blind principle) in all elementary life which YAHWEH Aelohim had made: and it said (this passion Nahash) unto"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"Aishah (volitive faculty of Adam), Why, hath Aelohim declared, ye shall not feed upon all the substance of the organic enclosure?\" He comments: 1W13R Now-eager- Covetousness ... it is well know that the Hellenists and Saint Jerome, have seen here, only a snake, a serpent, properly speaking: indeed according to the former a very wise serpent, ocpy cppovtpw.sa.coq and according to the latter, a serpent very skillful and very cunning, serpens callidor. This wretched interpretation appears to go back to the epoch of the captivity of Babylon and to coincide with the total loss of the Hebraic tongue: at least, it is there that the Chaldaic paraphrase has followed it. He says &% Km a most insidious serpent. The word m3, as it is employed in this case, cannot mean a serpent. It is an eager covetousness, self-conceited, envious, egoistic, which indeed winds about in the heat of man and envelops it in its coils, but which has nothing to do with a serpent, other than a name sometimes given metaphorically. It is only by restricting this figurative expression that ignorant people have been able to bring it to a point of signifLing only a serpent. The Hellenists have followed this crude idea. If, through delicacy of sentiment or respect for Moses, they had wished to rid the veil in this passage, what would have become of the garden, the tree, the rib, etc. etc.? I have already said, in the part they had taken, they had to sacrifice all to the fear of exposing the mysteries. The root Wll which, as I have said in explaining the word TBTl, darkness, indicates always an inner covetousness, a centralized fire, which acts with a violent movement and which seeks to distend itself. The Chaldaic, derives a great many expressions from it, all of which are related to anxiety, agony, sorrow and painful passions. It is literally, a torrefaction; figuratively, an eager covetousness, in Arabic, it is suflering, a grievous passion. It is finally, a turbulent agitation. In the Ethiopic this root verbalized in the Hebraic Wic'l, depicts the action of being precipitated, of being carried with violence toward a thing. The analogous verbs have the same meaning in Arabic, Ethopic and Syraic. There is nothing in these which restricts us to the idea of a serpent. The hieroglyphic analysis can perhaps give us the key to this mystery. The reader will remember that I set down two different roots, % and IVN, to designate equally, the first principle, the elementary principle and the unknown principle of things. I shall now state the important differences that the Egyptian priest conceived between these two roots, and in what manner they expressed this difference. They attached to both, the idea of movement; but they considered % as the symbol of movement proper, rectilinear; and WN at that of relative movement circular. The hieroglyphic character which corresponds to these two movements was likewise a serpent: but a serpent sometimes straight and passing through the center of a sphere, to represent the principle %; sometimes coiled upon itself and enveloping the circumference of this sphere, to represent the principle m. When these same priests wished to indicate the union of the two movements or the two principles, they depicted a serpent upright, uncoiling itself in a spiral line, or two serpents interlacing their mobile rings. It is form this last symbol that the famous caduceus of the Greeks has come. The priest were silent as to the inner nature of both these principles; they used indifferently the radicals % or VN to characterize the ethereal, igneous, aerial, aqueous, terreous or mineral principle; as it they had wished to make it understood that they did not believe these simple and homogenous things, but the composite ones. Nevertheless, among all these several significations, that which appeared the most frequently was that of fire. In this case, they considered the igneous principle under its different relations, sentient or intelligible, good or evil, and modified the radical word which represented it, by means of the signs. Thus, for example, the primitive '1N became 13N to designate elementary )re, %, light, TN intelligible brightness, etc. If the initial vowels is hardened, it takes a character more and more vehement. TI represented an exaltation, literally as well as figuratively: Ti, a burning center, '20, a passionate, disordered, blind ardor. The primate WN was nearly the same. The movement alone still distinguished the two"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"principles, whether, they were exalted or whether they were debased. The rectilinear movement inherent in the primitive %, prevented the confusing of its derivatives with those of the primitive WN, in which the gyratory movement dominated. The two radicals 'PT and represented alike a central3re; but in the first T, it was a central fire form which the igneous principle radiated with violence; whereas in the second tWI, it was, on the contrary, a central fire, from which the same principle being moved in a circular movement, was concentrated more and more and destroyed itself. Such was the hieroglyphic meaning of this root which I have already examined under its idiomatic relations. This coincidence ought not to leave any doubt in the mind of the reader. Now the sign which governs it in the word Iflfif, is that of passive action, individual and corporeal; so that the devouring ardor expressed by the root m, becomes by means of this sign, a passive ardor, cold in its vehemence, contained, astringent and compressive. Literally, it is every hard and refractory body; everything acrid, cutting and corroding; as copper, for example, which this word signifies in a very restricted sense, figuratively, it is every sentiment, painful, intense or savage, as envy, egoism, cupidity, it is, in a word vice. This is the real signification of the word Iflfi3. I have been obligate to extend my proofs more than usual; but its importance demands it. It can be clearly seen that it does not signify simply a serpent. Moses, who has spoken so much of the reptilian life, in the beginning of the Beraeshith, was carefully not to employ it. The word Yw which he uses, is that which, in his idiom, indicates veritable a serpent. One can easily recognize here the source of the French and Latin word, and that of the Celtic sertz, which is preserved without alteration in the modern Oscan.\" [d'olivet, 1976, p. 94-97] 111. Swendenborg: \"By the 'serpent' is here meant the sensuous part of man in which he trusts ... The sensuous things in man they (the most ancient people) called 'serpents', because as serpents live close to the earth, so sensuous things are those next the body. Hence also reasoning concerning the mysteries of faith, founded on the evidence of the senses, were called by them the 'poison of a serpent', and the reasoners themselves 'serpent'; and because such persons reason much from sensuous, that is, from visible things (such as are things terrestrial, corporeal, mundane and natural), its is said that 'the serpent was more subtle than any wild animal of the field ... Among the most ancient people, who were celestial men, by the 'serpent' was signified circumspection, and also the sensuous part through which they exercised circumspection so as to be secure from injury.\" [Arcana Coelestia, pp.83-84, 861 IV. Inman: This word gives us an insight into the association of ideas which prevailed in ancient times. It signifies 'a serpent.' Yet there is nothing very particular about serpents in general; but some, the cobra in India, and the asp in Egypt, for example, have the peculiarity of being able to raise and distend themselves, thus becoming erect. Hence, either or both of these creatures were emblematic of male activity, and covertly represented the phallus. The same word signifies 'a serpent,' and 'to be hard or firm;' and this again is associated with nahash, 'to be unclean, or adulterous.' Moreover, the serpent, being an emblem of diving power, neither roars, bleats, nor sings; it simply hisses. . . .that serpents were supposed to utter oracles, those who taught the credulous to believe so utter words of their own therefore, in a hissing manner; hence the same nahash expressed 'to whisper,' 'to give an oracle,' and 'an omen.' It also signified 'brass, or copper.' ... the reader of Scripture is struck by the fact that the same Moses, who, amidst the thunders of Sinai, was forbidden to make any graven image ... (Exodus 20:4), should be told by the same authority to make a serpent of brass, which was not only the emblem of life, but was to become itself a life-giver, and remain for may succeeding centuries an object of veneration to the faithful (2 Kings 18:4). messiah. \"the anointed\" (one), king, high priest, which is translated Christos in Greek, and Christ in English.

Originally, Satan (as ha-Satan) was a great Angel, chief of the Seraphim, head of the order of virtues. While Seraphim were usually pictured as 6-winged, Satan was shown as 12- winged.

Consulting these texts we find, literally, 'an angle of the Lord' is Satan; that David might become Satan if he went to fight; That Abishai and Joab were Satanic.. . whilst, if we turn successively to 2 Samuel 24:1, and 1 Chronicles 2 1 : 1, we recognize that astounding fact that Satan and Jehovah are identical! Peter, the rock upon which the Christian church is said to have been built was designated 'Satan' by the his master (Matthew 26:23). Jesus teaches his disciples to pray to their Almighty father (Matthew 6:13), 'lead us not into temptation;' whilst James 1 : 13 declares that God tempts no man. These apparent discrepancies may be reconciled by comparing Jehovah and Satan to the Hindu Siva, who is both creator and destroyer. [Inman, 1942, Vol. 2., pp. 697-6981 lmO Satariph.

The 3' decanate of Pisces is attributed to the 10 of Cups, or the power of Malkuth, which is physical existence, in Briah, the creative thoughts and images. The influence form Briah in Malkuth, when misunderstood, results in the misinterpretations that binds us, and too much reliance on physical sense reports. When we understand this plane, the dark antagonist is seen to be the perfect order of the kingdom. It is here that we must become aware of our dwelling place in Briah, where all aspiration are actualities.

Throughout eternity, with no cessation does the utterance of the Ruach Elohim the might of El Shaddai the source of Life; and the Living Soul Nephesh is the vehicle of that utterance. Note that in the letters of Nephesh (WDI), Perpetuity bun], Utterance [Peh], and Ruach Elohim [Shin] the Fiery Breath of the Eternal Spirit of Life. Shaddai El Chai refers to Nephesh, or the Vital Soul and is that same Almighty Ever living One. It is the center in all animate forms, as well as in the and life of man. Through countless generations that Life perpetuates Its utterance by means of successive generations of human bodies. It is because of this that Yesod is the field of renewal through procreation. Shaddai El Chai is Lord of the Universe, and Holy is His Name, Blessed be He. Shaddai El Chai is the source of life, as in the command \"be fruitful and multiply.\" This commandment can also be fulfilled be the generation of children as well as the generation of something more subtle. The clue is in the word Yesod (70') because it can be read as Yod-Sod, or the secret of Yod. Yod is the Creative Power of the Hand, as well as the channel for the transmission of Life. Life is Chaiah, seated in Chokmah, to which Yod especially pertains. Chaiah is light (Aur,W). Aur is 207, or 9 x 23. Twenty-three is the number of ;M1, Chaiah, and 9 is Yesod. Furthermore Chaiah is in Chokmah and is the power of Ab the Father. Thus Life and Light are one; that Light is always pure and always Holy, and that the extension of Light is its multiplication through forms. But forms are manifest in varying degrees, and when it is your office to bring forth subtle forms, you fail if you miss your opportunity through the false belief that in the bringing forth of forms less subtle there is any essential failure. Failure is the missing of one's highest possibility. But what may be failure for you, may be supreme attainment for you Brother. Wherever Life is multiplied the giver of increase is Shaddai El Chai, and nothing that He effects has in it any loss or evil. Evil are man's judgments, but Life Itself remains forever good. The name 'W (3 14) 5N (3 1) 77 (1 8) adds to 363, and this is 11 x 1 1 x 3. Eleven is 7'l& (Od), and 3 is Gimel. 7'N is the magic power and Gimel is the beginning of Guph, the body. Aleph is the Breath, Vav is the Link, Daleth is the Door of Life and is Nogah also, which gives the Victory. In Gimel or 3 is Recollection and Union. Thus the letters of Od speak loud. In Yesod is all this centered and they who know the secret of Yod, become the extenders of the paternal Life and Light. Thus is Yesod called the Sphere of the Moon. Note also that Key 2, The Moon, pertains to the letter Gimel, the letter of Union. Do not seak the spiritual at the expense of the body.

The scripture says Adam was formed from the 'dust of the ground\", and careless superficial reading of the letter of this text and others like it, has led to an erroneous conception that man is a creature essentially different from his creator.

Hence it is that Moses was not able to draw near to the place of God and to fix his gaze on what was to be seen there until he was first enveloped in another garment, as we read: 'And Moses entered into the midst of the cloud, and went up unto the mount' [Exodus 24:18], that is, he enveloped himself in the cloud, as in a garment, and then he 'drew near into the thick darkness where God was' [Exodus 20: 181, and 'was in the mount forty days and forty nights' [Exodus 24: 181, and was able to see what he did see.

Thus Jesus and Jehovah, in Hebrew are identical in respect to the first and third letters, but different in respect to the 2\"d and 4th. A Shin takes the place of the first Heh, and a Ayin of the second Heh. Now Shin corresponds to the Perpetual Intelligence, knowledge of perpetuity, changeless consciousness of the real nature of the Ego, and it is the liberating consciousness of personal immorality, that this recognition is the dominant characteristic of Jesus teaching and personal consciousness. In the Tarot Shin corresponds to Judgement, a picture of resurrection with which the name of Jesus is inseparably identified. Thus the substitution of Shin for Heh in Jesus name is the substitution of Liberation for rulership. Jehovah is the ruler (For Heh is the Emperor) and his self-consciousness is that of the Constituting Intelligence. Jesus is the liberator, and his self-consciousness centers upon the idea of releasing men from bondage and death. The final letter of Jesus name is Ayin. In the Kabalah this is Renovating Intelligence, the knowledge that preserves and renews the personal existence. This letters is associated with the Devil, because the first step towards liberation is to recognize what evil really is, so that we can attribute to it absolutely no power to determine the course of our lives. The story of Jesus temptation is a clue to this Jesus did not teach because he had to overcome the Devil. And his way of doing so was the command: 'Get thee behind me Satan! Thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God.' When we realize that God is the principle of our lives, all evil is recognized as subordinate and without power. To fear the devil is to worship him. Therefore the Lord's prayer asks God not to lead us into temptation instead of pensioning him to allow us to be tempted by Satan. Jesus, according to Cabalistic attributions of the letters, is consciousness of the Divine Will (Intelligence of Will) reflected in the realization that human personality is essentially immortal (Perpetual Intelligence, \"My word shall not pass away.\"), and these two modes of consciousness are combined in the knowledge or Wisdom destined to Triumph over all error and failure (Vav, Triumphant and Eternal Intelligence) which is the true catholic church, having for its foundation Jesus' personal triumph over the Devil, and of the subordination of matter to thought, which is destined to make all things new (Renovating Intelligence, Ayin). If we know the will of God (Yod) if we, by daily meditation, become habitually conscious of personal immorality (Shin); if we rely upon the ever- victorious and eternal wisdom within for guidance (Vav), if we fear no evil, and see no evil, and are conscious of our power to make all things new (Ayin), we have in us the mind which was in Christ Jesus. The sum of the letters in Jesus name is 386. Articulated this is 300, 80, 6, or Shin, Peh, Vav. Consciousness if immorality (Shin) overthrows the structure of false science and common-sense (Peh), and makes us rely wholly on the guidance of the indwelling spirit (Vav). By reduction 386 is 17. Articulated this is 10, 7 or Yod and Zain. Consciousness of divine will and of our relation to it (Yod) is expressed in the harmonious relationship of the objective and subjective minds to each other, and to the supreme spirit, and this is a consciousness that enables us to make a right deposition of all our talents, powers and possession (Disposing Intelligence, Zain). By reduction 17 is 8, the same number that represent the final reduction of the letter values of IHVH. Thus the name Jehovah and the name Jesus are represented by the same root-idea. Thus the I AM, Jesus is the recognition of the identity of the personal self with the universal I AM. Both names imply knowledge of the dwelling place of the supreme spirit (Intelligence of House of Influence). Jehovah is the I AM saying: 'My temple is man, and my knowledge is the hearts of men.' Jesus is man saying 'I am the temple of God; God and I are essentially One, He rules in my heart.' The same truth is revealed in both names from opposites points of view. The sum of the two names is 4 12. Articulated, this is 400, 10, 2 or Tav, Yod, Beth; Administrative Intelligence, Intelligence of Will, Intelligence of Transparency; the World, the Hermit, the Magician. By analogy 412 is the number of the Holy Ghost; since it proceeds from 26 (the Father) and the Son (386). Now the Hebrew word for Spirit is Rauch, spelled M'1, so that its numerical value is the sum of 200, 6 and 8. or 214. Note that 21 4 is 41 2 reversed. The same figures, then that enter into the number produced by the addition of the names of the father and son, which by analogy as the product of the numerical equivalent of the names of father and son, should be a number corresponding to spirit, are found in the number of the word, Rauch. The reduction is 7, the"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"number of Zain, and the Holy Ghost is therefore seen to be the Disposing Intelligence, represented in Tarot by the Lovers.

The Trinity, then is that which expresses itself in the Wisdom that reconciles all opposites, and the wisdom that unites man and God. The reduction of 23 is 5 or Heh: Constituting Intelligence or the Emperor. The Emperor, then is the symbol of trinity, regarding as the supreme wisdom constituting all the conditions of existence. 386 - 26 = 360. This significant number is that which added to the number of Jehovah, produces Jesus. It is the number of the circumference, and the son is the circumference having the father for its center. Articulated 360 is 300, 60 or Shin and Samekh. Perpetual Intelligence and Intelligence of Probation or Trial. Jesus is the 1 AM, consciousness of immorality, and demonstrates that immorality by actual test or trial. Reduced to 360 is 9 or Teth. Intelligence of the Secret. Jesus is the I AM or God's knowledge that he dwells in the temple of man, expressed as consciousness of the Great Arcanum, that all the forces of nature are subject to the subjective mind of man when that reflects the I AM.

Sefekh means the number seven; she is therefore an image of Typhon. According to Gerald Massey, Sefekh is a survival of Khefekh or Khepsh of the Seven Stars, once worshipped at Ombos as the 'Living Word'. By the later solar cults she was abhorred as the Great Harlot. The word khepsh means, literally, the hinder thigh, a symbol of the vagina which is itself an image of the Primeval Typhon, the Mother of Set. She typified the first parent known at a time when the role of the male in procreation was unsuspected. Because she had no consort she was considered to be a goddess without a god, and her son - Set - being fatherless was also godless and was therefore the first 'devil',' the prototype of the Satan of later legends. One of the totems of Typhon was the Dove. This was continued by the solar cults where it typified the male bearer of the ruach or creative spirit, attributed to the element air.

The camel is the chief totem of this path for it traverses the desert of the Abyss; it is the traditional ark or ship of the desert. Its humps contain the vital liquid of life that sustains the Adept during his crossing. The 13'~ path is thus the path of the Virgin who contains within herself the unawakened potential of the wife who is ascribed to the next path. The position of these two paths - 13 and 14 - constitutes the Sign of the Cross. The Abyss is the place of crossing over from the world of appearance (phenomenon) represented by the obverse of the Tree, to that of dis-appearance (noumenon) represented by the hind side. The magical powers of the kala of the moon include clairvoyance and divination. Not the kind of divination associated with the eleventh kala (q-v.) which issues ventriloquilly via the open womb, but divination by dreams emanating from the 'sealed womb at night, i.e. when the lunar light is eclipsed. The 1 3th, 14'~ and 1 5th kalas, resuming as they do the full formula of the female, form the Primal Cross or place of crossing over from the material world into the world of ghosts or spirits. The virgin menstruates and is sealed, dark, unillumined, unawakened; the wife or whore is open, awakened, her formula is love; the mother again is sealed, but after a different fashion for she brings forth what is shut in her womb. The fluid plasma of the astral light that permeates the tunnels is alive with potential that becomes manifest only when it comes to the surface of the Tree, splits into myriad forms, and swarms through the black hole in space represented by Daath, the Gateway to the Abyss. The manifestation of the non-manifest is effected, magically speaking, via the lunar current which characterizes the High Priestess of this kala in her virginal, unawakened, or 'dreaming' phase. The verse in the grimoire applicable to this kala reads: Now hath Nuit veiled herself, that she may open the gate of her sister. Not two women, but one only is implied by this statement. Nuit veils herself in sleep, i.e. she becomes virginal, menstruous, in order to open the gate of her sister - the gate of dreams. In a naturalistic sense the veil is the clothing assumed by primitive woman at the onset of puberty. In a physiological sense it is the unruptured hymen. When Nuit opens the gate she veils herself and is therefore able to divine by dreams seen in the mirror of magical sleep or trance. This is the sense in which virginity, or the state of 'sleeping', is here intended. In yet another sense, the opening of the gate refers to the gate of the mother of Path 15 wherein the unmanifest is made manifest as the birth of the child through the gateway of matter. But this is a later formula and belongs properly below the Abyss, whereas the Gate here intended is the Gate of the Abyss itself. The disease typical of this path is not surprisingly subsumed under the general label 'menstrual disorders', but it should be understood that whereas this disease is applicable to the path, the corresponding disorders obtaining in the tunnel beneath the path comport disorders of the lunar current itself, and the consequent spawning of lemurian horrors. This is substantiated by the magical weapon of the path, the Bow and Arrow. In the Tarot Trump attributed to this kala, the High Priestess is shown with the bow and arrow across her thighs. The bow is also a glyph of the rainbow which has a direct mystical connection with the lunar formula. The symbolism of the bow, as the emblem of Sothis, the Star of Set, and of the rainbow. In ancient Hebrew the name of the rainbow - qesheth or gashed is a qabalistic synonym of qadosh, a method- of sexual magick involving the use of the lunar current. The specific magical formula of kala 13 is P'?N [signifying the 'Elemental Gods'], the number of which - 81 - is the number of witchcraft presided over by Hecate, or Hekt, the frog-headed goddess. It is necessary to guard against interpreting the term witchcraft in its usually accepted sense, which does not pertain to these higher levels of the Tree. The real meaning of witchcraft is to be sought in the image of the frog which has a secret significance for initiates that is far closer to the concept of Lovecraft's batrachian fantasies than is the puerile assessment of the subject by mediaeval churchmen and witch-hunters.

Ol?I'l$? Uriens. The Sentinel of the 16\"' Path (tunnel) of Vav on the inverse Tree of Life. I. The 16'~ Path Transmits the influence of the Hierophant, and its tunnel is sentinelled by the demon Uriens, whose number is 395, and his sigil shows a seven-armed figure; the upper four arms terminate in yods; the lower three, in crosses. The seven-armed figure is a glyph of the Tree of Life [The upper three sephiroth are not always included in diagrams of the Tree]. It has relevance to the worlds below the abyss. The seven also refers to the original Light in Heaven represented by the stars of Ursa Major. Note that 395 - the number of Uriens -- is also that of P'Dm, the 'heavens'. The seven arms, the four yods, the three crosses, make a total of 59 in all (7 + 40 + 12) and this number furnishes a wealth of clues relevant to the meaning of the sigil. According to the Kabbalah Denudata, 59 is PW, meaning 'brethren'; it refers particularly to Samael who is stationed in the midst of the Zodiacal Qtiphoth accompanied by his shakti, the Elder Lilith. She guards the South East Corner and her companions are the Serpent and the Man. The serpent is a glyph of menstruation and 59, as 1-3, means precisely this. It derives from the Egyptian word neti, meaning 'being', 'existence', 'negative', 'froth', 'the sign of bleeding', 'female source'. This number therefore explains why the Adimiron (The Bloody) are the qliphoth attributed to the Tunnel of Uriens. In the list of Primes, Crowley describes 59 as 'The Yoni calling for the Lingam, as ovum, menstruum, or alkali'. Furthermore, and to"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"endorse the interpretation, the word 137 (59) signifies 'tail' or 'extremities'. The name Uriens suggests Oriens who, as Atlas, supported the universe on his shoulders. The idea of support or bearing is borne out by the general symbolism associated with this kala which endows the Adept with the magical siddhi of physical strength. The magical instrument ascribed to the 16'~ Path is the Seat, Throne, or Altar, which are curiously feminine symbols for a kala associated with the Hierophant until it is remembered that, in the New Aeon, the 'Lord initiating' (i.e. the hierophant) is the god Set, who is identical with his Mother, Typhon, and therefore the continuation of her kala, 15. She is in fact the Goddess 15, a name given to the Woman Fulfilled whose symbol, the full moon, occurred on the 15'~ day. The 16'~ kala was therefore her child, i.e. Set, and Set-Typhon under a single image was typified by the Dog Star, Sothis. According to Wilkinson. Set-Typhon was known as 'The Giant' and this symbolism equates it with the pre-eval Nephilim. The name of the seat in Egyptian is Hes, or Isis. The throne bears the God, as the woman bears the child, as the altar bears the priest. The part of the body associated with the 16'h kala is the shoulder, an euphemism for that which bears or supports the world, i.e. the Mother. Hence the association with Atlas (Oriens) who bears the world on his shoulders. Uriens or Oriens, as the name implies, is also attributable to the Orient, the place of the rising sun or solar-phallic power. This phenomenon, both in its cosmic (celestial) and in its microcosmic (biological) aspect lies behind the name of the Ordo Templi Orientis, O.T.0, which being interpreted means the Order of the Temple of the Exalted or Risen Phallus. The verse of 23 1 relating to this Path declares: Also is the Star of Flame (i.e. the Phallus) exalted, bringing benediction to the Universe. A glance at the columns of Liber 777 shows that Uriens is attributed to the eleventh kala which is ruled by air and whose tunnel is presided over by Satan, Prince of the Powers of the Air. (Man). He is one of the entities accompanying Lilith in the spaces between the south and east cardinal points of the zodiacal qliphoth at the center of which is the 'evil' angel Samael. Within the inverted dimensions of these spaces stands the Throne of Samael. Before this stands the altar on which is stretched the nocturnal Lilith, Mother of Abortions [a reference to the Nephilim]. The concept is explicit in the number of Uriens, for 395 is R?~WB Abortiens. Furthermore, the reflection of the Hierophant is refracted into the depths of the Abyss in the form of Set or Pan (Samael), the devil [or Satan, meaning opposer] or double being the 'opposite' image. Likewise, this concept is explicit in the number of Uriens, for 395 is 33m, meaning 'twofold', 'duplex'. It derives from the Egyptian shen, two', 'twofold circle', and 'the other', the alter ego. Thus are the Heavens (Pmm, 395) reflected into the hells, and the Hierophant or Magus of the Eternal becomes the judge [mv, 3951 of the 'dead', whose symbol is the jackal, the howler in the haunts of the dead, and 'the eater of dung in the day of Be With Us'.
