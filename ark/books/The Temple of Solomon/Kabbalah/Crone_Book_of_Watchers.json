In explanation of this passage the exegetes tell a gripping story about a woman named Anåh•d or Zuhra (i.e. Venus) or BŸdukht (daughter of God) who tricked two amorous angels into telling her the great name of God, or some other magic formula that the angels had used to ascend to heaven, whereupon she rose to heaven herself; there she became the star Venus, while the two angels were left behind on earth and punished by being hung upside down in a well in Babylon, where people would come to them for magic knowledge. The exegetes add that angels had descended to earth with God's permission to act as judges because they were upset by the terrible behaviour of human beings, believing that they could do better than humans even if they had to contend with passions; God decided to put them to the test and provided them with passions for purposes of the experiment; and the woman proved them wrong by inducing them to drink wine, kill and practise idolatry before making them reveal their secret formula to her.1 It is well known that both the Qur<ånic passage and the gripping story are developments of the account of the fallen angels in the so-called Book of Watchers, a work attributed to the antediluvian figure Enoch (great-grandfather of Noah).

The interest of all four or five examples lies in the light they throw on the religious milieu in which the Qur<ån arose and the relationship of the Qur<ån (and indeed the exegetical tradition) with an old debate in the Near East about how sin had come into the world. The fallen angels. Genesis, 6:2-4, informs us that in the antediluvian past there were giants (nephilim) on earth and that at that time \"sons of God\" consorted with \"daughters of men\", siring mighty heroes (gibborim); thereafter the wickedness of man led to the flood. This passage has its roots in an ancient Near Eastern myth about rebellion in the pantheon, and it was to generate a vast number of narratives itself. In fact, it is one of those cases where we can follow the history of a couple of motifs and their endless transmogrifications from the dawn of history until today, seeing them meander like a huge river with a mass of constantly shifting arms and canals over the literary landscape of western Eurasia. It is quite an awe-inspiring sight.3 Here, however, we need to zoom in on the rivulet constituted by the Book of Watchers. The Book of Watchers is the first of five or more separate works which together make up the Ethiopic Book of Enoch (known as 1 Enoch).4 It is based on the assumption that the Biblical \"sons of God\" are angels, the normal understanding of the term in antiquity,5 and it casts the angels as sinners. They are guilty of transgressing both sexual and epistemic boundaries, for not only do they take human wives, as Genesis says, they also teach them sorcery and other illicit sciences, and the outcome is disastrous. They have giant offspring (the gibborim and nephilim, identified), and it is these giants who wreak all the havoc on earth that causes God to send the flood, without the damage ever being fully repaired; for though the rebellious angels are bound and jailed while their giant offspring are killed by obedient angels sent against them, their wicked activities continue due to evil spirits that have issued from them. The message of the book is that super-human forces rather than human beings are responsible for the existence of evil on earth; God sent the flood to rid the earth of the dreadful giants, not to punish humans, who suffer as innocent victims of superior powers.6 Fragments of this book, apparently dating from the second century BC and suggesting that the book itself goes back to the third century BC, have been found at   3 Nobody has tried to draw a picture of the entire river, but for a fine account of the already much ramified section from the ancient Near East to Augustine, see N.

Then the rabbis turned against it. The second-century rabbi Simeon b. Yohai cursed all those who explained the \"sons of God\" as angels: in his view they were sons of judges. Some said they were called \"sons of God\" because they lived long and easy lives.11 The Aramaic targums duly translated \"sons of God\" as \"sons of judges\" (Neophyti) or \"sons of nobles\" (Onqelos and Pseudo-Jonathan; similarly the Samaritan targum), while Symmachus, a Jewish or Jewish Christian translator of the Bible into Greek active in the late second or early third century, opted for \"sons of the powerful\".12 They were explained as human beings of one kind or another by all the main commentators on the Bible, Qaraites included, thereafter.13 The protagonists of the story   7 J.

The angels and their demonic offspring had enslaved mankind by teaching them murder, war, adultery, magic and other terrible things, not least worship of themselves in the guise of pagan deities, Justin Martyr (d. 165) explained, developing 1 Enoch 15, 8 and 19. The angels had taught humans astrology, magic, metallurgy, cosmetics, and idolatry, as Clement of Alexandria (d. c. 215), Tertullian (d. after 220) and Lactantius (d. c. 320) said.15 Philosophically inclined Christians such as Origen (d. c. 255) interpreted the story allegorically,16 but even he held the angels to have taught humans astrology.17 That they and their demonic offspring were responsible for idolatry and diverse forms of illicit knowledge came to be a generally accepted Christian view. It was also as false gods and demons that the angels passed into Manichaean literature.18 By the third century, however, the Christians too had begun to turn against the story, and the Enoch literature in general.19 The \"sons of God\" were not angels, it was now said, but rather righteous men, more precisely descendants of Seth who had been seduced by lascivious women descended from Cain in the period between the expulsion from Paradise and the flood. First encountered in Julius Africanus (fl. c. 200, a Syrian despite his name), this version of the story was to prevail in Greek and Syriac literature, and indeed in Catholic and Protestant interpretation up to modern times.20 In short, the responsibility for evil was shifted from superior powers to humans themselves.

For all that, the Book of Watchers continued to be read by Greek and Syriac Christians. Jacob of Edessa (d. 708) even defended the Enoch book of which it formed part, convinced of its antediluvian origins; and unlike their Byzantine counterparts, Syriac chroniclers rarely use disclaimers about the reliability of the Jewish pseudepigrapha when they cite them.21 One reason why the Jews turned against the story is that angels, both pure and fallen, were getting out of control. There is a fair amount of evidence for veneration or actual worship of angels among the Jews of the first centuries CE,22 sometimes involving the angels in general and sometimes a principal angel cast as mediator between God and mankind; speculation about such an intermediary had probably contributed to the rise of Christianity, and devotion to angels and/or an angelic viceregent (notably in the form of Metatron) continued in Judaism after the first two centuries, too.23 Gnostics also operated with the notion of an intermediary, but they postulated that he was evil and filled the void between the all too distant God and mankind with demonic beings, convinced, like the pseudonymous Enoch, that human beings were victim of superior forces of evil beyond their control. Gnostic myths abound in sexual union by seduction or rape between evil archons and primordial humans, now by direct retelling of the Watcher story,24 now by distant echo of it (or independently), and the result is sometimes called abortions (Hebr. nephalim, an alternative understanding of the nephilim of Gen. 6:1).25 A similar filling up of divine space was underway in the \"underworld\" of Platonism, as Dillon calls the confluence of Gnostic, Hermetic and Chaldaean thought characteristic of late antique paganism.26 That humanity is at the mercy of unfathomable forces of the universe is also the key conviction behind late antique magic, devoted to the control of such forces by manipulation of the angels in charge of them.27   21 Cf.

Rather, they coped with it by closing the door on the world outside and crediting evil, like everything else, to God while at the same time making Him so homely and familiar a figure that everything He did seemed bearable. It was not the case that there were \"two powers in heaven\", let alone \"many ruling powers in heaven\"; rather, God and Israel formed a tightknit family, whatever the ups and downs. Personal morality was what mattered, not the uncontrollable developments in the world of gentiles: evil was now dealt with primarily as an \"evil inclination\" (yetzer ha-ra>) in the human heart.30 The Christians, meanwhile, had split the godhead into three and allowed for an almost autonomous realm of evil, setting them well on the way in the Gnostic direction; but they saved their Biblical concept of the deity by casting God as the ultimate creator of the evil realm, while at the same time absolving him of responsibility for it by recourse to the concept of free will. The devil they placed in charge of the evil realm had a long history entwined with that of the fallen angels, who accompanied him in the transfer of the decisive fall from the period before the flood to the beginning of human history.31 Pseudo-Enoch's explanation of the flood was discarded. To both Jews and Christians, eliminating Enoch's fallen angels was all the more desirable in that the idea of angels copulating with women had come to feel offensive.32 Angels were superior beings. Besides, they had no passions, and even if they did, they had no bodies. How could they desire the corporeal, let alone cause human reproduction? The whole story was perverse and absurd, Cyril of Alexandria (d. 444) insisted, stressing that the \"sons of God\" mentioned in Genesis were not to be understood as angels. \"Is it not probable that many will be discouraged by this and choose sensuality.....if we believe that even the very angels fell subject to passion?\", he asked.33 Meanwhile, the story of the \"sons of God\" had been taken up by pagans. Some adduced it in polemics against Christianity, arguing, as did Celsus (c. 170), that it showed Jesus not to have been the only angel to have come, or, as did Julian the Apostate (d. 363), that it proved Moses to have believed in many gods without knowing anything about Jesus. 34 (To late antique pagans, gods and angels were interchangeable, and Christ was commonly envisaged as an angel in early Christianity.35) Others read the story as an   28 Noted by Bamberger, Fallen Angels 92. 29 Fossum, 'Angel of the Lord', 52f. 30 Bamberger, Fallen Angels, esp. 49, 57, 95, 101f; E.

The Watcher story began to be connected with that about Adam and Eve already in the first century BC. 32 That they cannot sin is affirmed already by the Jew in Justin Martyr's Dialogue with Trypho, 79,1. 33 Wickham, 'Sons of God and Daughters of Men', 135-38.

Shoemaker, Ancient Traditions of"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 7account of the origins of the occult sciences. It was after all to the fallen angels that astrologers, alchemists, soothsayers, diviners, magicians and their likes were believed to owe their knowledge, as they themselves were well aware. A Syriac, i.e. pagan or Christian, incantation bowl against \"all the evil magical arts\" (presumably written by someone who saw his own magic as beneficent) refers to \"angels that reveal the mysteries of their lord\".36 Zosimus (c. 300), a Hermetic alchemist from Panopolis, where the book of Enoch was still read in the fifth or sixth century, 37 says that the holy scriptures mentions angels who descended from heaven and mated with women, teaching them \"all the arts of nature\", and that they were punished for this since these arts were bad arts \"of no benefit for the soul\"; he adds that Hermes, too, talked about these events in his Physika, and that indeed they are mentioned in almost every exoteric or esoteric treatise. He is clearly pleased by the Biblical and Hermetic agreement on the angelic origin of the arts of nature, however lacking in benefit to the soul they might be.38 Zosimus' claim that the story had gone into esoteric works accords with a remark by Jacob of Edessa (d. 708), according to which Athanasius of Alexandria (d. 373) had proscribed the Enoch literature because heretics had incorporated it in their secret books.39 There are in fact traces of 1 Enoch in the Hermetic literature,40 and among the Hermetic works that Zosimus may have in mind is a small treatise known as Isis the prophetess to her son Horus. In this work, Isis tells of how one of the angels (or, according to one version, a prophet or angel) caught sight of her and wanted to make love with her, which she refused to do unless he would tell her about the preparation of gold and silver first; the angel said that this was beyond his ability, but sent another angel, Amnael, who also wanted to make love with her and who was eventually persuaded to part with his secrets. (Whether he got his payment is not stated.)41 As de Ménasce observes, in Isis' account the Watcher story seems to have fused with an Indian myth regarding two ashvins, twin Vedic gods who roam about in the world of mortals and try to seduce a married woman, but merely succeed in rejuvenating her old husband instead.42 In this story as in Enoch, the events lead to the appearance of temptations on earth, here by the distribution of intoxicating substances in drinks, women, gambling and sports; and this story, too, would have appealed to the practitioners       the Virgin Mary's Dormition and Assumption, Oxford 2002, ch. 3 and Appendix A, translating an Ethiopic work preserving a fifth-century Syrian narrative). 36 J.

The hypothesis that their adventures had fused with those of the fallen angels would account for three otherwise puzzling features of Isis' version: there are only two angels in it, as opposed to the two hundred in the Book of Watchers;43 it only features one particular woman, as opposed to women in general; and the woman now obtains her secret knowledge by not mating with the celestial beings. It is presumably the same quasi-Indian version which is reflected in rabbinic allusions to the story in which the angels form a pair.44 It is in any case this version which lies behind the Gnostic story of a woman called Norea, Noria, Noraia, Horea, Orea, Nuraita or the like, who resisted the attempts of the wicked archons to seduce her, to be rescued by Eleleth, a holy angel who revealed the truth to her.45 (This seems to be the only form in which the Gnostics took a positive interest in the teaching of the Watchers, which they normally condemn, in so far as they mention it at all.)46 It is also in this form that it was familiar to Muslim exegetes: two angels court one woman, who tricks them into parting with their secrets without mating with them. Though the rabbis and the churchmen had not succeeded in killing the story, they had clearly managed to relegate it to the fringes of respectable society. It was now mainly among pagans, Gnostics and devotees of the occult that it flourished, outside the mainstream communities or, if within them, in the somewhat marginal circles of alchemists, diviners and magicians.47 It must have been from such circles that it passed to the Qur<ån.

J. M. Robinson, Leiden 1988, II, 5, 123). Most Gnostic works retell the story of the Watchers in recognizable form without saying anything about their teaching, see the 'Valentinian Exposition' (op. cit., XI, 2, 38); the 'Apocryphon of John' (op. cit., II, 1, 29); Agapius' summary of Awdi's doctrine in Agapius, Kitåb al->unwån (ed. and tr.

Urbach, The Sages, 97ff; B. Kern-Ulmer, 'The Depiction of Magic in Rabbinic Texts: the Rabbinic and the Greek Concept of Magic', Journal for the Study of Judaism 27, 1996, 289-303)."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 9In the Qur<ånic passage on Hår¥t and Mår¥t as in the Isis story, the angels form a pair, but they are not guilty of any sexual sins; they merely teach people magic. So too do the demons (indeed, the passage can be taken to say that the demons teach magic which they have learnt from the angels), but it is only the demons who render themselves guilty of kufr thereby. The angels are cast as agents of God: they warn their customers not to render themselves guilty of kufr, explaining that their own function is to test their faith (innamå na ̇nu fitna); and what they teach is something sent down to them. Why angels should be teachers of magic, and how they came to be in Babylon, we are not told; nor are we told how, if at all, they relate to the demons. There is no suggestion that the latter are their giant sons; and though the false angels/gods of the mushrik¥n are sometimes explained as demons (jinn) in the Qur<ån,48 it is nowhere suggested there either that they were the offspring of angels. The problem that preoccupies the Qur<ån in the passage on Hår¥t and Mårut is that some People of the Book (i.e. Jews or Christians) prefer magic to the truth. In the preceding verse it complains that a party of the People of the Book react to the fact that a messenger has come to them from God by throwing the book behind their backs (2:101); they prefer to follow that which the demons related to Solomon, i.e. magic.49 Solomon was not an unbeliever (even though he used magic),50 we are assured, but the People of the Book clearly are, for they disregard the advice of Hår¥t and Mår¥t not to turn infidel by using their services. From the two angels they learn \"that with which to split up a man and his wife\" (just as in the Book of Watchers the angels teach the daughters of men \"to make hate-inducing charms\", 1 Enoch, 9:7), and thereby they forfeit their share in the hereafter (2:102). We clearly find ourselves right in the middle of Jewish magic, a well attested phenomenon, and one in which speculation about Solomon is well known to have played a role.51 Famed in antiquity, it is represented in the Greek magical papyri from Egypt, dating from the second century BC to the fifth century CE (though these texts are generally pagan),52 in Aramaic amulets mainly from Palestine, in incantation bowls from Sasanian Iraq,53 in the Hekhalot literature, reflecting the period c. 200-800 CE,54 in   48 Q. 6:100; 34:40f; 37:158. Jinn are not normally demons, but rather spirits who may or may not be evil, but in the Qur<ån the word seems to be used almost synonymously with shayåã•n. 49 According to many exegetes, the demons did not relate things to Solomon, but rather against him. Talå >alayhi normally means \"he related/recited to somebody\", but the verse is problematic because it has them relate things >alå mulk Sulaymån rather than >alå 'l-malik Sulaymån. Some exegetes tried to solve the problem by understanding the >alå as adversarial (against the kingship of Solomon) ; others read it as chronological (at the time of Solomon's kingdom). Since none of these constructions really click, it seems more likely that mulk is in need of emendation. 50 Or, in the understanding of the exegetes, even though the demons maligned him by calling him a magician rather than a prophet. 51 Cf.

De Ménasce conjectured that it was via the Manichaeans that the angels passed into the Qur<ån, on the grounds that it was probably Mani who gave the angels Iranian names, just as he (or his disciples) renamed the giants.59 But such evidence as we have goes against this suggestion. In Genesis, the angels and giants are anonymous; in the Book of Watchers they have acquired names, and here the leading angel is called Shemi ̇azah while the one who reveals the divine secrets is called Asael (>s<l), also rendered Azael (>z<l) and Azazel (>z<zl – a name which conflated him with the devil).60 The fragments of Mani's Book of Giants do indeed iranianise the names of two giants as Såm and Nar•mån, but they just adapt Šem ̇azai as Šahm•zåd;61 and though we do not know how Azael's name was rendered, the fragments operate with two hundred Watchers (now demons) rather than two.62 It is more likely to have been via magic that the angels were renamed, given that it is in the context of magic that the Qur<ån mentions them.

It is a striking fact that although the Qur<ån gives the angels Iranian names and says very little about them, the exegetes effortlessly recognized them as the fallen angels from the Watcher story. The Iraqi exegete al-Kalb• (d. 763) even knew their pre-Iranian names. In his version there are three angels, as also in the Sefer Hekhalot (3 Enoch), perhaps by development of the three (or four) angels who observe the misbehaviour of the giants from heaven in the Book of the Watchers.64 Sefer Hekhalot called them Uza, Aza and   55 Cf.

One of them failed to make the descent, he says, while the other two bore the additional names of Hår¥t and Mår¥t.68 Al-Kalb• and other exegetes also knew the events to be associated with Enoch (now called Idr•s).69 As the exegetes tell the story, it is not about angelic revolt or the origin of sin. Rather, it is about how tough it is to be a human being: even the angels lost control of themselves when they experienced the enormous surge of sexual passion. Cyril of Alexandria's warnings notwithstanding, this plainly did not serve to encourage immorality, but on the contrary to warn against smug self-confidence; and if the angels came out badly in the story, it only went to show that they had no reason to feel superior. The exegetes thus linked the story with the theme, familiar from rabbinic literature, of rivalry between angels and human beings: the story put the angels in their place.70 Though the exegetes went out of their way to stress that angels were not normally endowed with passions, some continued to find the story offensive and construed Hår¥t and Mår¥t as human beings by reading malikayn (\"two kings\") for malakayn (\"two angels\") at Q. 2:102, or they read the verse as saying that magic was not sent down to the two angels.71 (The story of the sons of Seth seduced by the daughters of Cain was well   65 Reed, 'From Asael and Šemi ̇azah', 122 and n64.

Indeed, it returned to the world of high culture, and not only for Muslims, but also for Jews, who liked the Muslim version of the story even though their own exegetes continued to identify the Biblical sons of God as human beings.74 The story proved extremely longlived, too. In 1915 an Indian Muslim in Germany wrote a summary of the story of Hår¥t and Mår¥t in Persian for the Orientalist Littmann: it now involved two women to match the two angels, the women had become singers and dancers, and both ended up as planets; that apart, the story was much as it had been told by al-Kalb• and his likes over a thousand years earlier.75 Other echoes. As Reeves notes, there seems to be a second reflection of the Book of Watchers in Q. 2:30, on God's creation of Adam.76 In the Qur<ån as in the Jewish and Christian literature of the time, it is at the dawn of human history that sin comes into the world, thanks to an arrogant angel who is expelled from heaven and proceeds to seduce the daughters of men in the form of Eve. There had been much interaction between the Biblical story of Adam and Eve and that about the sons of God and daughters of men as developed by later authors, and motifs originally associated with the flood had been transferred to the time of the creation.77 In the Qur<ånic account of the arrogant figure, here known as Ibl•s, the fact that he is envisaged now as an angel (Q. 7:11; 15:28-31; 17:61; 38:73) and now as a demon (min al-jinn, Q. 18:50) is presumably an Enochic legacy. But it is in the account of God's creation of Adam that we encounter a more direct reflection of the Book of Watchers. In Q. 2:30 God tells the angels that he intends to create Adam, which is also what he does in rabbinic accounts (but not in Christian ones);78 and here as there, the angels object to God's plan. Both versions, in other words, pick up the theme of rivalry between angels and humans. In the rabbinic accounts the angels sometimes object to God's plan on   72 Cf. al-$abar•, Ta<r•kh al-rusul wa'l-mul¥k, ed. M. J. de Goeje and others, Leiden 1879-1901, i (tr. F.

Psalms, 8:5; 144:3-4);79 at other times they object that man is all falsehood and discord,80 or they enquire what his deeds will be like,81 or God tells them that he will be righteous without telling them that he will be wicked too.82 In the Qur<ån they object to the creation of a being who \"will do corruption in the earth and shed blood\", and God overrules them, saying that he knows what they do not. Here as there, God knows something that he is not telling the angels, but here it is the angels who foresee the wickedness of mankind, and there is a new stress on bloodshed. As Reeves says, this would appear to reflect Genesis, 6:11-13, on the generation of the flood who \"corrupted the earth\" and \"engaged in violence\", as retold in the Book of the Watchers: here three or four angels observing the earth from heaven see \"much blood being shed upon the earth, and all the oppression being wrought upon the earth\".83 The events leading to the flood having been transferred to the beginning of human history, the angelic objections are now made, not on the basis of observation of the earth in the time of Enoch, but rather by way of foresight at the time of Adam's creation, and they no longer comment on the terrible behaviour of the giants in the pre-flood generation, but rather on that of all too fallible humans in general. (\"Corruption in the earth\" is denounced in many other passages, too.) In the Qur<ån as in the rabbinic literature, however, God overrules the angels, putting them in their place: for all their faults, humans have a special place with Him. In the exegetical literature the transfer of the events from the flood generation to human pre-history had other repercussions. The Book of Watchers presents the righteous angels as descending to the earth to fight the giant offspring of their fallen colleagues. In the exegetical and historical literature of the Muslims, the giants have become an angelic tribe of jinn who lived on earth, where the angel and/or jinn Ibl•s, the future Devil, was sent to serve as their judge, or he was the ruler of heaven and earth at the time until he grew arrogant and disobeyed; or the jinn became infidels and caused corruption in the earth, whereupon Ibl•s was sent against them with an army of angels, which caused him to become arrogant and rebel.84 These events are sometimes used to explain Adam's status as khal•fa (deputy or successor): Adam succeeded or replaced those angels or spirits on earth, we are told. The implicit message is that Adam's title did not mean \"deputy of God on earth\", or in other words that the caliphs could not invoke Qur<ånic support when they styled themselves deputies of God, as they did from >Uthmån   79 Thus Reeves, 'Some Explorations'. 53. 80 Bereshit Rabba 8, 5, where the angels are divided over the question. 81Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 38b, where God responds by destroying them until he gets the answer he wants. 82 Bereshit Rabba, 8, 4. 83 1 Enoch 9; cf.

One part of the story thus came to be associated with a wholly new set of burning problems, once again in connection with political changes.85 There could be a third reflection, or more precisely development, of a theme from the Watcher story in the Qur<ånic stress on the fact that the angels only descend at the command of God, or with His permission. In Q. 19:64 unnamed speakers, generally assumed to be the angels, declare that, \"We do not descend (natanazzalu) except at the command of your (sg.) Lord\", adding that everything belongs to Him and that He does not forget, with the next verse spelling out the implications: \"so worship (sg.) Him\". In 97:4 the night of qadr is identified as the night in which the angels and the spirit descend (tanazzalu) with God's permission.86 Neither passage has anything to do with the Enoch story. (19:64f comes not long after the mention of Enoch's elevation to an exalted place, 19:56f, but it does not seem to be connected with it, or indeed with anything that precedes or follows it.) The insistence that the angels only descend with God's permission, or at His command, is nonetheless striking, especially in 97:4, where there does not seem to be any reason to stress it. (The exegetes claim that the obscure 19:64 was a response to Mu ̇ammad's impatience at a time when Gabriel had long stayed away.) In 65:12 it is simply God's command that descends (yatanazzalu), without reference to the angels or the spirit who serve as its bearers: in all three passages we are reminded that the only power in the universe is God. The same point is also made in polemics against the alleged angels of the polytheists: whether they are genuine angels falsely worshipped, demons, or just empty names, they have no power (e.g. 7:191-3; 21:42f; 36:23, 74f); it is only with God's permission that they can act (53:26). Rebellious angels who descended from heaven of their own accord were problematic from this point of view. Well before the rise of Islam, however, there were some who claimed that the Watchers had descended to the earth with God's permission. In Jubilees (c. 150 BCE) they come down \"to teach the sons of man, and perform judgement and righteousness on earth\".87 In the Jewish Christian Pseudo-Clementine Homilies (c. 300 CE) we are expressly told that they asked for permission to descend, here as in tafs•r because they are upset by human ingratitude to God and wish to convict and punish the guilty, that is to act as judges.88 And in Sefer Hekhalot the angels who descend no longer seem to include the wicked ones at all: it is the ministering angels who come down from heaven, they do so to execute God's will on earth, and their descent is placed in the quasi-Paradisical period after the fall familiar from the Christian story of the sons of Seth and daughters of Cain; that those who taught mankind sorcery were also angels by origin is left unstated.89 In line with this, the Qur<ån nowhere says that Hår¥t and Mår¥t had defied God. Since their status as angels is accepted, they are presented as obedient even as teachers of sorcery (2:102). What is   85 Cf.

But the repeated reminders in other contexts that angels do not descend without being ordered or permitted to do by God are likely to be inspired by familiarity with claims to the contrary. Finally, in the Qur<ån, 33:33, the following words are addressed to the wives of the Prophet: \"stay in your houses and do not make a display, like that of the first Jahiliyya (al-jåhiliyya al-¥lå)\". The reference here would seem to be to the women who had been taught to beautify themselves by the angels (1 Enoch 8:1), an innovation which was singled out for particular reprehension by Tertullian in number of writings: the angels were responsible for the means of \"womanly ostentation\" such as jewelry and eye-make up; it was on account of the angels that they had to be veiled, he claimed.90 The Book of Watchers, as also Jubilees and Christian works, sees the flood as the first global disaster to overtake mankind, prefiguring the last judgement.91 In 1 Enoch the flood is explicitly called \"the first end\".92 That the first end should have been preceded by the first period of ignorance/barbarism is a natural inference, and the Christians seem to have made it too, though the one example I have come across lacks the eschatological perspective.93 Some exegetes duly assign the first Jahiliyya mentioned in the Qur<ån to the period before the flood, either between Adam and Noah or between Idr•s and Noah, explaining it with reference to a story of the people of the mountain versus those of the plains (i.e. a version of the Christian story which replaced the sons of God and daughters of men with Sethians and Cainites).94 The overall impression conveyed by these references is that the Watcher story formed part of the general background against which the Qur<ån was revealed. The story clearly did not come directly from the Book of Watchers. The fact that there are only two fallen angels in the Qur<ån, that they bear Iranian names and are located in Båbil, that the angelic comments on human misbehaviour are set in the time of Adam rather than that of Enoch, that they are associated with the theme of rivalry between angels and humans, and that Enoch's own time had apparently come to be known as the first Jåhiliyya, all this goes to show that the material had long circulated, in written and/or oral form, in circles which continued to revere the Enoch tradition, but which also participated in developments among mainstream Jews and Christians. Three of the four Qur<ånic allusions come in Medinese suras (2:30, 102; 33:33); the fourth, which is not so much an allusion as further thought about angelic descent, comes in Meccan ones (19:64; 97:4). >Uzayr. The possibly fifth example appears in the 9:30, another Medinese sura, in which the Jews are famously accused of regarding a certain >Uzayr as the son of God:   90 VanderKam, '1 Enoch, Enochic Motifs', 51, 68; cf. also 66, on Clement of Alexandria. 91 J.

That is what they say with their mouths, imitating the unbelievers before them. God curse them, how deluded they are\". In the Qur<ån, a son or daughter of God is always an allegedly divine being, usually Christ (as here) or the gods/angels worshipped by the so-called polytheists (mushrik¥n), so the charge that is being levelled against the offending parties here is deification of created beings. Even when the Jews and Christians are accused of calling themselves sons of God, the implicit charge is of deification: the retort includes the point that the Jews and Chritians are just human beings created by Him (bashar mimman khalaqa, 5:18). Of course, the Jews and Christians did not deify themselves, nor is the author of the accusation likely to have thought that they did: he is simply being polemical. But here at least we know where he got his polemical ammunition from (ultimately Deut. 14:1; Psalms 82:6; John 1:12). The same cannot be said in the case of >Uzayr. The exegetes almost unanimously identify >Uzayr as Ezra,95 and modern commentators usually follow suit; but the Jews did not call Ezra the son of God, let alone deify him, as they themselves pointed out. This was well known to the exegetes, who responded by postulating that a small group of Jews had worshipped Ezra as the son of God in Medina at the Prophet's time, or that just one man had done so, or alternatively that all of them had done so in the past, when Ezra had restored the Torah to them, but that they had since stopped, or that they were still doing it somewhere else: the Jewish denial of the charges could thus be discounted.96 Similar suggestions have been made by modern scholars too.97 But the Jews were surely right to remain unpersuaded. Polemics are not of course a genre conducive to accuracy, but polemical charges do need a sting in order to hurt, and it is hard to see where it was in this particular case. The passage proved more of a liability to the Muslims themselves than it did to the Jews. It thus seems unlikely that Ezra was meant, but what is the alternative? One of the more interesting suggestions is by Newby. According to him, >Uzayr is indeed Ezra, but only in name; in substance he is Enoch, with whom, in Newby's view, he had come to be identified thanks to the fact that both of them were scribes who had been translated directly to heaven instead of dying; Enoch in his turn was identified with the angel Metatron, who was regarded as \"the lesser YHWH\" in circles cultivating merkaba mysticism; and as Metatron he was chief of the angels who were known as \"sons of God\" (and whose appellation had somehow rubbed off on him?); the term \"son of God\" could in any case be applied to any righteous men. \"It is easy, then, to imagine that among the Jews of the Óijâz who were apparently involved in the mystical speculations associated with the merkâbâh, Ezra, because of the traditions of his   95 For an exception, see below, note 108. 96 Cf.

If I have understood Newby correctly, he sees the Qur<ån as taking issue with Jewish speculation that \"perhaps -- God forbid -- there are two powers in heaven\", as disapproving rabbis put it.99 The second power was a principal angel, who was envisaged in some circles as Metatron, the angel who is a transfigured version of Enoch in Sefer Hekhalot,100 a work of which the relevant part is assumed to be pre-Islamic.101 So far, so good, but as the complications suggest, the evidence does not quite fit. The Qur<ån does not speak of Metatron or Enoch or even Idr•s (the name under which Enoch usually figures in the Islamic tradition), but rather of >Uzayr -- and getting Ezra into position as the second power in heaven is hard work. One can try with reference to IV Ezra (= 2 Esdras, 3-14, in the Apocrypha), 14:9, where God promises Ezra that \"you shall be taken up from among men, and henceforth you shall live with my Son and with those who are like you, until the times are ended\".102 It sounds as if Ezra is being promised angelification similar to Enoch's here, and the work probably did originally end with his assumption to heaven.103 For this reason IV Ezra figures in the attempts of several scholars to solve the problem of >Uzayr, sometimes along with the Greek Apocalypse of Ezra.104 But it is the messiah, not Ezra, who is here called the son of God.105 Scholars who focus on the Ezra literature accordingly have to postulate either that there was a hitherto unknown Jewish sect which elevated Ezra to divine sonship106 or else   98 G.

The text casually refers to \"before he was taken up\" (8:19); Ezra is told to divest himself of his human nature (14:14), and the work concludes with his assumption in eastern versions, including the Syriac (given in the margin in the New Revised Standard Version of the Bible). 104 Cf. M. E. Stone, 'Greek Apocalypse of Ezra', in J. H. Charlesworth (ed.), The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, i, New York 1983.

Metatron and Enoch were not called sons of God either, however. This is why Newby claims both that Metatron was chief of the fallen angels known as \"sons of God\" and that any righteous man could be thus called. But the first claim appears to be a straightforward mistake. To the extent that Metatron was Enoch, he was indeed associated with the fallen angels known as sons of God, but he was not their chief; nor is there any evidence that the label \"son of God\" was ever transferred to him. As for the second claim, it was back in Graeco-Roman times any righteous man could be known as son of God.109 The rabbis are said to have extended the sonship to every Israelite, or indeed every human being, at some point, but this does not actually solve the problem; for what the Jews are being accused of in Q. 9:30 is not calling all Israelites or human beings sons of God (à la Q. 5:18), but rather of using the expression of one specific figure; and if it had been possible to speak of Enoch/Ezra as a son of God in circles cultivating merkaba mysticism, why were the Jews so puzzled by the Qur<ånic charge? Given that the Jews simply did not recognize the sin they were accused of, it seems more likely that the identification of >Uzayr as Ezra is mistaken. This possibility was rejected by both Horovitz and Künstlinger, but their own suggestions work no better than Newby's.110 Where do we go from there? Newby must be right that we are up against something to do with angel worship. This could admittedly be questioned on the grounds that 9:30 presents the Jewish view of >Uzayr and the Christian view of Christ as parallel errors, suggesting that both parties were guilty of deifying human beings. But the parallelism lies in the fact that both are deifying created beings. Worship of Christ and angels is also put on a par in 4:172: \"The Messiah, Jesus son of Mary does not disdain being a servant of God, nor do the angels who are drawn near (al-malå<ika al-muqarrab¥n)\". Like Christ, the angels wrongly   107 Cf. D. Künstlinger, '>Uzair is der Sohn Allåhs', Orientalistische Literaturzeitung 35, 1932, 381-3, suggesting that Mu ̇ammad mistook the name of the book for the name of the son of God mentioned in it. For another hypothesis requiring him to mistake something, see Ginzberg in the following note. 108 This theory was advocated already in medieval times. Al-Biqå>• (d. 885/1480), NaΩm al-durar f• tanåsub al-åyåt wa 'l-suwar, Hyderabad 1969-84, viii, 439, cites the Jewish convert al-Samaw<al al-Maghrib• for the view that >Uzayr is not Ezra in the sense of the restorer of the Hebrew Bible. Al-Mahghrib•'s own view was that >Uzayr, whom he calls \"al->Uzayr\", was Eleazar (cf. his If ̇åm al-yah¥d, ed. M. >A. al-Sharqåw•, Cairo 1986, 152), but al-Biqå>• says that >Uzayr is the prophet Malachi (who is identified with Ezra in the Talmud (Megilla 15a) and elsewhere). The same suggestion was made, apparently independently, by L. Ginzberg, Legend of the Jews, Philadelphia 1909-38, vi, 432. Since Malachi (which means \"my angel\") is nowhere called a son of God, Ginzberg asks whether Mu ̇ammad confused \"messenger (i.e. angel) of God\" with \"son of God\". (I owe almost all of this to Joseph Witztum.) 109 The Jewish Encyclopaedia, New York [1964], s.v. 'son of God', with reference to Wisdom of Solomon, 2:13, 16, 18; Ecclesiasticus, 4:10; cf. also Philo, On the Confusion of Tongues, 145; id., Questions and Answers on Genesis, I, 92; Justin Martyr, Apology, 1, 22, 2, where Jesus would deserve to be called son of God for his wisdom alone even if he were wholly human.

If we persist in the search for a human being called \"son of God\" by the Jews, we are unlikely to get beyond the conclusion that Mu ̇ammad simply got something wrong. If we are prepared to consider the possibility that he knew what he was talking about, the only way in which Jews could be plausibly be accused of polytheism was with reference to their \"logos theology\", as Boyarin calls it, or in other words their veneration of a divine power, personified as an angel, as an intermediary between God and mankind.111 \"To this logos, His archangel, the Father of all has given the special prerogative to stand on the border and separate the creature from the creator\", as Philo (d. 50 CE) expressed it, happily referring to the logos as \"the second God\" and \"son of God\".112 The Christians duly took Philo to have been a Christian avant la lettre, but it is now recognized that such ideas were widespread in Judaism, especially in the first two centuries CE, but apparently much later too. In Sefer Hekhalot, a composite work which may date in its present form to the sixth/seventh century,113 it is Enoch-Metatron who is the second God, or more precisely \"the lesser God\", as Newby observes. The trouble is that no form of the intermediary is known ever to have been called anything like Ezra. Some eighty years ago, however, Casanova proposed that >Uzayr is a misreading of Azael.114 He made the suggestion in a brief communication without developing the thesis, and perhaps for this reason it fell flat: in effect, he simply substituted one strange name for another, with perfunctory reference to rabbinic sources. Even in our present state of knowledge it has to be said that the thesis has its problems. But as Wasserstrom says, it deserves to be revived,115 if only for a proper hearing. If >Uzayr is a misreading (or mishearing) of Azael, the force of the passage would be that the angelic intermediary venerated by the Jews was actually an evil figure, a demon trying to mislead them. This works well in that it is also one of the reactions to the pagan worship of angels/deities in the Qur<ån: on the day of judgement God will ask the genuine angels, \"Was it these who worshipped you?\", and the angels will reply, \"Glory be to you. You are our friend (wal•), not these. Rather, they worshipped the demons (jinn)\" (34:40f). Or again, \"they have made the demons (jinn) partners of God, though He created them, and falsely credit Him with sons and daughters, with knowing anything about it\" (6:100).116 The charge is all the more plausible in that Azael was an ambivalent figure. Though he was widely known as a fallen angel, a Greek amethyst lists Ichtys, identified as Christ by the chi-ro sign, with Raphael, Renel, and Uriel on one side and   111 See the reference given above, note 23. 112 Philo, Who is the Heir of Divine Things, 205; Questions and Answers on Genesis, ii, 62 (second God); On Husbandry, 51 (firstborn son). 113 Cf. above, note 94. 114 P.

The Problem of Symbiosis under Early Islam, Princeton 1995, 183. 116 Compare also 37:158: \"They have set up a genealogical relationship (nasab) between Him and the jinn\". Contrast 21:26 and 43:19: \"They say, 'al-Ra ̇mån has produced children', but they are servants raised to honour (>ibåd mukram¥n); \"they have made the angels, who are servants of the Ra ̇mån, females\"."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 20Michael, Gabriel, and Azael on the other;117 and in the Aramaic magical texts he is sometimes a fallen angel118 sometimes an anti-demonic power along with the archangels Michael and Raphael. One amulet goes so far as to include him among \"the holy angels who stand in front of the throne of the Great God\";119 one bowl text invokes Aza and Azael (>z< w->z<l) as well as Metatron against the demons;120 another, directed against Jewish, Arab, Persian, Indian, Greek and Roman sorceries, and of disputed date, invokes God, \"who sent Aza, Azael and Metatron (>z< w->z<l w-myããrwn), the great prince of His throne\".121 Here Metatron takes the place of the third member of the >z trio, normally Azael or Azazel. One would dearly like to know what the Qur<ån has in mind when it holds the Jews and Christians who credit God with a son to be imitating \"the unbelivers before you\" (alladh•na kafar¥ min qablu): is this another reference to the \"first Jåhiliyya\", now singled out for its polytheism rather than the female immodesty that prevailed at the time? There does not seem to be any way of telling. If Casanova's emendation is accepted, sura 9:30 would reflect much the same environment as the passage on Hårut and Mår¥t, and carry much the same message: \"the Jews say that Azael is a son of God\", i.e. the Jews prefer a figure associated with magic to the messenger who has been sent to them. The next verse tells us why: they, i.e. the Jews and the Christians, \"have taken their learned men (a ̇bår) and monks (ruhbån) as their lords (arbåban) apart from God, and al-Mas• ̇ son of Mary\" (9:31). This can hardly be a restatement of the claim that they deify >Uzayr and Christ, for Christ does not belong in the category of ruhbån, and he is mentioned again as a separate object of deification. It is equally implausible that the Jews should be accused of deifying an >Uzayr from among their a ̇bår and ruhbån, while the Christians deify Christ, for ruhbån are always Christian figures in the Qur<ån. Most probably, then, this verse attacks the authorities to which the Jews and Christians owe their horrendous beliefs: they elevate their own authorities to the position of God by following them in defiance of God as represented by the Messenger. That they deify al-Mas• ̇ appears to be mere repetition. \"They were commanded only to worship one God\", the verse continues, presumably meaning in the past and now also through the Messenger whom they ignore. Both groups hope to extinguish the light of God with the enormities they utter with their mouths, he says (9:32), using a phrase elsewhere associated with those who dismissed Jesus as a magician (61:6, 8).

The observer knew very well that the Jews did not really worship an angel, righteous or fallen, as the son of God: had he genuinely believed that they did, he would have argued against it as frequently as he did against the sonship of Jesus, not just on a single occasion. He is claiming that idolatry is what the beliefs of his stubborn opponents really amount to. How literally did he intend the charge? It could be argued that all he resented was the expression \"son of God\", having heard Azael described as such on some occasion: metaphorically meant or otherwise, it was wrong to say such things.122 If this is all he meant, his reaction would be comparable to that of a third/fourth-century Palestinian rabbi, who was offended by the passage in Daniel in which Nebuchadnezzar observes in amazement that the three youths in the fiery furnace are unharmed and that they have been joined by a fourth \"like the son of God\", i.e. an angel (Dan. 3:25): the rabbi claimed that an angel came down and slapped Nebuchadnezzar on the mouth for presuming that God had a son.123 What he meant was presumably no more than that one should not say anything conducive to the blurring of the boundaries between Jews and Christians (though he too could have been worried by Jewish \"logos theology\"). That the Qur<ånic observer was only bothered by words is at first sight suggested by the fact that he dismisses the claims regarding >Uzayr and Christ as \"(just) something they say with their mouths\" (dhålika qawluhum bi-afwåhihim)\" (9:30), a phrase elsewhere used of comparing one's wife to one's mother for purposes of repudiation and calling somebody else's son one's own by way of adoption (33:4). But the parallel passage is not in fact about words alone. What 33:4 rejects is the opponents' belief that the words create or reflect something real, whereas the truth is that they are only words (similarly 18:4f; 24:15; 61:1-8). Similarly, the truth about the angels/gods deified by the pagans is that they are just names (when they are not angels falsely worshipped or mere demons, 7:70f; 53:23). It is only when opponents are held to say with their mouths what is not in their hearts, or to have even worse thoughts in their hearts than in their mouths, that a distinction between mere words and actual beliefs is postulated (3:118, 167; 5:41; 9:8; 48:11f). In the passage on >Uzayr and al-Mas• ̇ the opponents do not simply use an offensive expression; they go so far as to reject the Messenger for the sake of the belief expressed by it. This is why they are accused of deifying their leaders too. The intertextual reference to the Jews who dismissed Jesus as a magician (in its turn conjuring up the polytheists who dismissed the Messengers as such) also shows the issue to be divine authority, this time along lines similar to the passage on Hår¥t and Mår¥t: the Jews go for the wrong leaders, preferring the very magic that they wrongly impute to the genuine Messenger. In 5:17-8, where only the Christian belief in a son of God is mentioned, both the Jews and Christians are once more accused of deification, not of their leaders, but rather of themselves: the concept of shirk extends to any form of authority other than that of God represented by Mu ̇ammad, as Comerro observes.124   122 This possibility was suggested to me by Behnam Sadeghi. 123 Alexander, 'Targumim and Early Exegesis', 61f, with reference to Jerusalem Talmud, Shabbat, 6, ad fin. 124 Comerro, 'Esdras', 170."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 22Here, too, the passage culminates in the claim that \"Our messenger has come to you\" (5:19). In short, 9:30 is directed, not just against the offensive expression \"son of God\", but also against actual beliefs held by Jews and Christians and the leaders under whom they upheld them. As far as the Jews are concerned, it has to be said if the reference is indeed to Azael, the charge was a brilliant polemical move, for it was one to which the Jews could only reply, \"yes, but.....\": yes, the fallen angels were described as sons of God in the Bible and the Book of Watchers; yes, Azael was one of them; and yes, it was to him that humans owed their knowledge of magic, in which he was often called upon; but the implication that he was worshipped in the same way that the Christians worshipped Christ was not true at all. What with so complicated a defence, the audience will have inferred that there was something to the charge. It merely so happened that a scribe was a bit too fast when he copied the name of the demonic figure, or alternatively that the name had come to sound too much like Ezra's, so that far from persuading later readers that the Jews had sold their souls to the devil, the verse persuaded the Jews and Christians that Mu ̇ammad was an ignoramus: his scripture was full of errors, the Jews did not regard >Uzayr as the son of God, as the Christians said in polemics of their own.125 There are no problems with Casanova's theory on the linguistic front. In Arabic, Azael (>Azå<Ÿl) would be written >Az(å<)•l. The main difference between that (>zyl) and >Uzayr (>zyr) in early Arabic script would be the size of the final letter:126 if the change took place in written transmission and the copyist was transcribing from Arabic to Arabic, all we need to put things right would thus be to postulate a minor scribal mistake. But the change could also have been effected orally, given that the shift from l to r is common in Semitic languages:127 in that case all we need to postulate is that Azael was pronounced as something like Ozael/Ozaer. We do in fact find the forms Uzael (>wz<l), Uziel (>wzy<l), and related forms, both on undatable magic amulets from the Syria region and in texts on incantation bowls from Iraq.128 One could also suggest other ways of achieving the same result. For example, an angel by the name of >Azriel (>zry<l) figures on amulets and magic bowls.129 He has no independent existence, and is nowhere identified as the son of God, but as yet another bearer of a name on the theme of >z, he could easily have been treated as another manifestation or associate of Azael, as in fact he seems to be in the trio Azael, Azriel, and   125 al-Jå ̇iΩ, 'al-Radd >alå 'l-naßårå', in his Raså<il, ed. >A.-S.

Or, as Comerro suggests, the name Azariah (>zryh) could be lurking in the background. It was borne by one of the three youths who were thrown into the fiery furnace and saved by the angel described by the awed Nebuchadnessar as \"like the son of God\".131 As it happens, it was also the pseudonym adopted by the archangel Raphael in Tobit, in which Raphael teaches Tobias to make medicine and drive away a demon, which Raphael then binds (Tobit, 8:11). Curing by binding demons is what most of the magic bowls of Iraq were designed to achieve. They often invoke Raphael. Given the premium on invoking as many powers as possible, the chances are that they invoked him under the name of Azariah too, thereby causing him to join the list of angels/sons of God whose names are variants on the theme of >z. In fact, it could have been Azariah-Raphael who generated the above-mentioned Azriel. Very few of the angels and demons invoked in magic texts had stable personalities, and strange-sounding names proliferated, but to disapproving observers such as the rabbis, the names on the theme of >z invariably conjured up fallen angels, or even the devil himself. The chances are that the same was true for the Messenger. In whatever form he may have heard the name of the offending son of God, he will have understood him as a rebellious angel and used him to unmask the wayward beliefs of the Jews: what they so stubbornly rejected him for was a demon. If this is accepted, one would assume the transmission to have taken place via Iraq, as in the case of Hår¥t and Mår¥t. Of course, >Uzayr could have entered via a different channel, but the Ethiopic Book of Watchers uses the forms Asael and, more commonly, Azazel,132 making Ethiopia unlikely as a source for our verse. The form Azael is attested in both Syria and Iraq, in Greek in the fifth/sixth-century Codex Panopolitanus and the ninth-century Syncellus, in both of which it is the only form used (AzaŸl); in the above-mentioned (Jewish-?) Christian amethyst, and in two magical texts from Egypt, one dating from the fourth-century, the other from the sixth or seventh;133 in Aramaic on a Palestinian amulet,134 in rabbinic sources,135 and on incantation bowls.136 The related forms Uzael and Uziel also appear on both sides.137 We know from Justinian that there were Jews on the Byzantine side who denied that \"the angels exist as God's work and creation\", i.e. they held the angels to be uncreated (and thus divine), but whether they venerated a principal angel is not said.138 It is in the Babylonian Sefer   130 Naveh and Shaked, Amulets and Magic Bowls, 68f (amulet 7:3). 131 Dan. 1:6f; 3:20-25; Comerro, 'Esdras', 172f, with exegetical traditions which actually identify >Uzayr as one of Daniel's companions. 132 Black, Book of Enoch, 121. 133 K.

Problem. So far, Casanova's hypothesis seems to work wonders, but it raises one intractable problem. Why did the exegetes not recognize Azael behind his new name? The nearest we get to it is Muqåtil's claim that >Uzayr was described in the Pentateuch (tawråt), but he could of course simply have meant somewhere in the Hebrew Bible in general rather than the Pentateuch in particular.141 It is all the odder in that the exegetes effortlessly recognized the fallen angels behind their Iranian names of Hår¥t and Mår¥t. It has to be stressed that the exegetical reaction to >Uzayr is peculiar even if we discard Casanova's hypothesis, for given that the early exegetes knew very well that Jews did not deify Ezra, one would have expected them at the very least to discuss the person intended before settling on the identification of Ezra and >Uzayr. Maybe they did. In the fragments of a Greek translation of the Qur<ån made before 870, possibly in Umayyad Syria, the Jews are accused of saying that Israel is the son of God.142 In this formulation the charge makes perfect sense. In the so-called prayer of Joseph, Jacob declares himself to be \"Israel, an angel of God and a ruling spirit...the firstborn of every living thing\" (compare Colossians 1:15, 17, on Christ), as well as \"the archangel of the power of the Lord and the chief captain among the sons of God\".143 This angel is also familiar from Christian, Manichaean and other Gnostic writings as well as from rabbinic texts.144 But the Muslim exegetes do not seem to preserve any memory of this reading, and it is hard to see how Isrå<•l could have been misheard or misread as >Uzayr. Maybe the Syrians had improved on the Qur<ånic text because it did not make sense to them. However this may be, all exegetes on record accepted that the Qur<ån spoke of >Uzayr and unhesitatingly identified this figure as Ezra. As early as 170/786 certain Sa>d pronounces Mu ̇ammad,       against Jews who deny the resurrection, last judgement and the createdness of the angels is hardly ever discussed. 139 See the references given above, notes 100, 120f. 140 Thus the curse text mentioned above, note 66. In this text (which mixes Jewish, Christian and pagan elements), the \"lower foundation\" of the universe is occupied by seven \"sons of God\" (bny <lhy), who keep the universe together with seven powerful words (Levene, Corpus, M163:9, and commentary). By origin, they are presumably a new version of the fallen angels, but whether the magician sees them as such is not clear. He proceeds to speak of the \"sons of glory\" (line 13) and thereafter about the trio Azael, Azael, and Azaziel, pressed under a mountain with their faces downwards (line 18). Levene thinks that the \"sons of glory\" may be identical with the \"sons of God\" (comm. to line 13), but does not say whether he thinks the same could be true of the trio. 141 Comerro, 'Esdras', 168, citing Muqåtil b.

If so, one wonders if Mu ̇ammad had as well. \"God does not command you to take the angels and prophets as lords\", we are told in Q. 3:80: did >Uzayr belonged in the category of prophets rather than that of angels to the speaker of those words? If he did, we are back where we started: how could the author of the Qur<ån claim that the Jews called Ezra the son of God? Either the Messenger's understanding is peculiar or else that of the exegetes is: in effect, Casanova's hypothesis merely shifts the problem from the one to the other. It has to be said, however, that this is not the only occasion on which the exegetes settled without discussion or disagreement on what to a modern scholar looks like an obvious mistake; there is another example in Q. 24:33, and here there can be no doubt that they did so in departure from authorial intentions.146 Of course, exegetes are everywhere in the habit of disregarding authorial intentions: they make of the revelation what they need. But they do not usually do so with complete lack of hesitation or disagreement, least of all when they know their interpretation to be problematic. The problem of >Uzayr could well lie in the early history of Muslim exegesis rather than in the understanding of the Prophet, or in other words that Casanova may still have the better hunch. Until that can be shown, however, the verdict on his theory must be \"not proven\". That the accusation in 9:30 refers to Jewish veneration of an angelic viceregent remains the most plausible solution; how this being acquired the name of >Uzayr remains unclear. Conclusion. Though Azael's presence in 9:30 remains conjectural, the four other echoes of the Book of Watchers have at least done something to relate the Qur<ån to a well-documented context on the fringes of the Arab world in late antiquity. Relating the Qur<ånic material to earlier traditions could be said to be one of the most pressing needs for historians of the rise of Islam.147 This has now come to be generally recognized, after a long hiatus in which origins tracing had a bad name. One can see why it fell into disrepute. Back in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century there was a tendency for Western scholars to envisage Mu ̇ammad as picking up bit and pieces of religious lore from his Jewish, Christian and diverse other neighbours without much understanding of what they meant, in order to mix them all up and then use them in altogether different contexts in Mecca and Medina. Much work was done on where he had picked up his bits and pieces, but given the magpie model, it did not seem illuminating: what did it matter whether this came from Christianity and that from Judaism, or somewhere else if it had all been denatured in the process of transmission? More recent scholars not unnaturally found the interest of the ideas to lie less in their origin than in their meaning in the new contexts to   145 Y. D. Nevo, Z. Cohen and D.

Origins-tracing never seemed to further our understanding of anything, merely to harp on the theme of the \"parasitic dependence\" of Islam on earlier religions, as Reeves says.148 But religious (and all other) ideas do grow out of earlier ideas, by tiny incremental changes; even revolutionary changes are achieved by very small steps; and though the older literature never showed these steps, merely a haphazard collection of information and mistakes, as if Islam had arisen by misunderstanding, there was more than prejudice to the picture it presented. The Orientalists were reacting to the fact that it was, and remains, extremely difficult to overcome the sense that Islam arose in a world apart. The tribal societies evoked in pre-Islamic poetry, the ayyåm, Ibn Hishåm or al-Wåqid• are so utterly different from the Near East described in Greek, Syriac, Aramaic, Coptic or Iranian works that one automatically classifies ideas which can be shown to have originated in the non-Arabian Near East as \"foreign elements\", or in other words as features appearing out of their normal context, so that they have to be explained by mechanisms such as traders accidentally picking up this and that on their journeys. What we see in the Qur<ånic treatment of the fallen angels in the four (possibly five) passages examined here, however, is not the impressions of a passer-by who had picked up some ancient story without much sense of what it meant to his informants. What we see is the story in the context to which it had come to belong by late antique times, complete with the magic practices it was held to explain and the angry sense of being outflanked by disreputable people that the situation induced in the observer. Wherever or whenever the encounter(s) took place, the observer is engaging with the tradition as it looked at his time, not simply plundering it, let alone getting things wrong. Looking back, we can follow the tradition he grappled with till it disappears in the dawn of history; looking forward, we can see what it came to mean to his many followers thereafter down until today. Islam here grows by imperceptible steps, however drastic the observer's reaction, out of the environment that was before it, creating a new one as it does so. It would be enormously illuminating if we could see the entire book in this way.   148 Cf. Reeves in his introduction to his Bible and Qur<ån, ix. "}]
