The first commentaries on this book were written in the I Oth century, and the text itself is quoted as early as the sixth. References to the work appear in the first century, while traditions regarding its use attest to its existence even in Biblical times. So ancient is this book that its origins are no longer accessable to historians. We are totally dependent on traditions with regard to its authorship. Equally mysterious is the meaning of this book. If the author meant to be obscure. he was eminently successful. It is only through the most careful analysis, studying every word with its parallels in Biblical and Talmudic literature, that its haze of obscurity begins to be penetrated. There have been many interpretations of the Sefer Yetzirah. The earliest commentators tried to interpret it as a philosophical treatise, but their efforts shed more light on their own systems than on the text. The same is true of efforts to fit it into the systems of the Zohar or later Kabbalists. Efforts to view it as a book on grammar or pho­netics are even more unsuccessful. In general, the Kabbalah is divided into three categories, the the­oreticaL the meditative, and the magical. 1 The theoretical Kabbalah, which in its present form is based largely on the Zohar, is concerned mostly with the dynamics of the spiritual domain, especially the worlds of the Sefirot, souls and angels. This branch of Kabbalah reached its zenith in the writings of the Safed school in the 16th cen­tury, and the vast majority of published texts belong in this category. Meditative Kabbalah deals with the use of divine names, letter permutations. and similar methods to reach higher states of con­sciousness, and as such, comprises a kind of yoga. Most of the main texts have never been published, but remain scattered in manuscripts in the great libraries and museums. Some of these methods enjoyed a brief renaissance in the mid I 700's with the rise of the Hasidic movement, but within a half century they were once again largely forgotten."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"SEFER YETZIRAH The third category of Kabbalah-the magical-is closely related to the meditative. It consists of various signs, incantations and divine names. through which one can influence or alter natural events. Many of the techniques closely resemble meditative methods, and their success may depend on their ability to induce mental states where telekinetic or spiritual power can effectively be channeled. As with the second category, the most important texts have never been printed. although some fr agments have been published. One of the best examples of these is the book Raziel. Careful study indicates that Sefer Yetzirah is a meditative text, with strong magical overtones. This position is supported by the ear­liest Talmudic traditions. which indicate that it could be used to cre­ate living creatures. Especially significant are the many reports and legends in which the Sefer Yetzirah is used to create a Golem, a sort o f mystical android. The methods of the Sefer Yetzirah appear to involve meditation: and it is highly possible that it was originally written as a meditative manual. A major 12th century philosopher thus states that it does not contain philosophy, but divine mystery.\" This comes across very clearly in the commentary of one of the greatest Kabbalists, Isaac the Blind ( 1160-1236). who stresses the meditative aspects of the text. It is also particularly evident in a very ancient manuscript of Sefer Yetzirah. dating from the I Oth century or earlier. The introduc­tory colophon states. \"This is the book of the Letters of Abraham our father, which is called Sefer Yetzirah, and when one gazes (tzafah) into it. there is no limit to his wisdom.\"1 As we shall discuss in our commentary (on I :6). the Hebrew word t::: afa h does not denote mere physical gazing. but mystical meditative insight. This very early source would therefore support the position that Sefer Y etzirah was meant to be used as a meditative text. The commentaries which treat Sefer Yetzirah as a theoretical text. read much of it in the t hird person: \"He combined,\" \"He formed.\" and the like. According to this reading, the text is referring to God's creation. In many cases, however, the grammatical form more closely resembles the imperative} The author is telling the reader to \" combine\" and \"form \" as if he was actually giving instruc­tions. In many other cases, the text is unambiguously instructive, as in such passages as, \"if your heart runs, return to the place,\" and, \"understand with wisdom. and be wise with understanding.\" Rather than have the text oscillate between the third person and the impera­tive. it would certainly be more logical to read it all in the imperative. The Sefer Y etzi rah thus becomes an instruction manual for a very special type of meditation. Out of deference to the majority of com­mentaries we have refrained fr om translating it in the imperative, but"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Introduction XI the implications of such a reading are discussed in the commentary. What we therefore have in Sefer Yetzirah appears to be an instructional manual, describing certain meditative exercises. There is some evidence that these exercises were meant to strengthen the initiate's concentration, and were particularly helpful in the develop­ment of telekinetic and telepathic powers. It was with these powers that one would then be able to perform feats that outwardly appeared to be magical. This is supported by the Talmudical references, which appear to compare the use of Sefer Yetzirah to a kind of white magic. 5 An important 13th century commentator writes that students of Sefer Yetzirah were given a manuscript of the book Raziel, a magical text containing seals. magical figures, divine names and incantations. 6 The Text The Scfcr Yetzirah is a very small and concise book. In its Short Ver­sion. it is only some 1300 words long, while the Long Version contains approximately 2500 words. The Gra Version used in this translation contains around 1800 words. So short is the text, that one of the earliest fr agments appears to have the entire book written on a single page. 7 There is speculation that the original source may have contained as fe w as 240 words. 8 The present text contains six chapters. and in some editions, these arc said to parallel the six orders of the Mishnah. 9 Some ancient sources, however. state that the book contains five chapters, and it seems likely that the present fifth and sixth chapters were combined as one in these texts. 10 The earl iest commentator, Saadia Gaon, in a somewhat different version, divides the book into eight chapters.11 The text is presented dogmatically, without substantiation or expla­nation. In the first chapter in particular, it is solemn and sonorous, read­ing like blank verse poetry. Very few Biblical passages are quoted, and with the exception of Abraham, no name or authority is mentioned. The book seems to be divided into four basic parts. The first chap­ter introduces the Sefirot, speaking of them at length. After this, how­ever. there is no mention whatsoever regarding the Sefirot in subsequent chapters. This had led to some speculation that the Sefer Yetzirah might actually be a combination of two (or more) earlier texts. The second chapter consists of a general discussion about the letters of the alphabet. It clearly appears to be introducing their use in a medi­tative context. Also introduced in this chapter are the five phonetic fa m­ilies and the 231 Gates. Again, neither the phonetic families nor the Gates arc ever again mentioned in the text."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"XII SEFER YETZIRAH Chapters three to five discuss the three divisions of the letters, \" mothers, doubles, and elementals.\" These are related to the \" universe, soul and year.\" presenting a fairly detailed astrological system. In these chapters, the entire thrust of the book is changed, and they contain vir­tually no hint whatsoever of its meditative aspects. This, however, can be explained by a principle found in many later Kabbalistic texts. In order to focus spiritual and mental powers, one must take into account the time and astrological environment.12 The sixth chapter again does not appear to have a clear connection to the earlier parts of the book. although in the Long Version, it is pre­sented almost as a commentary. Here, for the first time, are introduced the concepts of the \"axis. cycle and heart,\" ideas which arc not discussed any place else in Hebraic or Kabbalistic literature. with the exception of the BahirY Of all the chapters, this one seems the most obscure, and it is difficult to decide if its emphasis is theoretical or meditative. This chapter concludes with a stanza linking the Sefer Yetzirah to Abraham. It is this quote that serves as a source to the tradition that the book was authored by the Patriarch. Authorship The earliest source to which Sefer Yetzirah is attributed is the Patriarch Abraham. As early as the I Oth century, Saadia Gaon writes that, \"the ancients say that Abraham wrote it.\"1 4 This opinion is supported by almost all of the early commentators. 15 Such ancient Kabbalistic texts as the Zohar and Raziel also attribute Sefer Yetzirah to Abraham.16 A number of very old manuscripts of Sefer Yetzirah likewise begin with a colophon calling it \"the Letters of Abraham our Father, which is called Sefer Y etzirah.\" 17 This does not mean. however, that the entire book as we have it now was written by Abraham. As Saadia Gaon explains, the principles expounded in Sefer Yetzirah were first taught by Abraham, but they were not actual ly assembled in book form until much later.18 Another authority notes that it could not have actually been written by Abraham, since if it had, it should have been incorporated into the Bible, or at least be mentioned in scripture.1 9 Similarly, when the Zohar speaks of books antedating the Torah, it does not include the Sefer Yetzirah among them.2o The attribution of Abraham is supported by the final stanza of Sefer Yetzirah: \"When Abraham ... looked and probed ... he was success­ful in creation ... \" This passage clearly suggests that Abraham actually made use of the methods found in this text."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"lmroduction XIII In many editions of Sefer Yetzirah, scriptural evidence is provided by the verse, \"Abraham went as God had told him, and Abraham took ... the souls t hat t hey had made in Haran\" (Genesis 12:5). According to some commentaries, this indicates that Abraham actu­ally used the powers of Sefer Y etzirah to create people. 21 This would be the earliest example of the use of Sefer Y etzirah to create a Golem. According to this, Abraham would have learned how to use the myster­ies of Sefer Y etzirah before God told him to leave Haran. 22 Other authorities, however, say that \"making souls\" refers to con­verting them to belief in the one true God. and this is also supported by the Zohar. 23 Some commentaries attempt to reconcile this with the text of Sefer Yetzirah, explaining that with the miracles wrought through the Sefer Yetzirah, Abraham was able to convince people of t he power of God, and thus convert t hem to true belief.24 The scripture states. \"t he souls that they made,\" in the plural. This would indicate that Abraham was not alone in his use of Sefer Yetzirah, but had a companion. A Midrash states that if Abraham would have engaged in the secrets of creation by himself, he would have gone too fa r in emulating his Creator. and he therefore worked together with Shem, son of Noah. 25 Ancient sources identify Shem with Malchizedek, who blessed Abraham and taught him many of the earlier traditions. 26 The most important mysteries of Sefer Yetzirah involve the inner significance of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Here too, we find that Abraham was a master of these mysteries. A Midrash thus states that \"the letters were given to none other than Abraham.\"2 7 As we shall see in the commentary (on 1:3 ), the arrangement ofthe animals when Abra­ham made his covenant with God, also appears to be based on the mys­teries of Sefer Yetzirah. Further support linking Abraham to the Sefer Yetzirah is found in the Talmudic teaching that \"Abraham had a great astrology in his heart, and all the kings of the east and west arose early at his door. \"28 Sefer Y etzirah is one of t he primary ancient astrological texts, and it is possi­ble that it incorporates Abraham's astrological teachings. The fa ct that this astrology was said to be \"in his heart\" might also indicate that it involved various meditative techniques, as was indeed the case with ancient astrology, and is also suggested by Sefer Yetzirah. There is evi­dence that these mysteries were also taught to Abraham by Shem, along with the mystery of t he calendar (Sod llalbbur).29 When God revealed himself to Abraham one of the first things that He taught him was not to be overdependent on astrological predictions. 30 Abraham was also fully aware of the magical and idolatrous uses that could be developed from these mysteries. The Talmud thus says that Abraham had a tract dealing with idolatry that consisted of 400 chapters.'1 There is also a Talmudic teaching that Abraham taught"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":".XI\\ SEFER YETZIRAH the mysteries involving \"unclean names\" to the children of his concu­bines. 32 This is based on the verse, \" to the sons of the concubines that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and he sent them away ... to the lands of the east\" (Genesis 25:6). These gifts consisted of occult mysteries, which then spread in eastern Asia. Th e attribution of t he mysteries of Sefer Yetzirah to Abra ham would place its origin in the 18th century before the common era. This is not very surprising, since such mystical texts as the Vedic scriptures date fr om this period, and there is every reason to believe that the mystical tradition was further advanced in the Middle East than it was in India at the time. Since Abraham was the greatest mys­tic and astrologer of his age, it is natural to assume that he was famil­iar with all the mysteries of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. Abra­ham was born in Mesopotamia, and he also lived in Egypt. The n ext place where we find the use of Sefer Yetzirah is in a tradition regarding the older sons of Jacob, which states that they used it to create animals and maid servants.31 When the scripture states that \"Joseph brought an evil report [regarding his brothers] to his father\" (Genesis 37:2), it is referring to this. Joseph's brothers had eaten an animal without slaughtering it properly, and Joseph did not know that the animal had been created through the Sefer Yetzirah and did not need such slaughter. He therefore reported that his broth­ers had eaten \"flesh from a living animal.\" The mysteries of Sefer Yetzirah were used again after the Exo­dus, when the Israelites were building the Tabernacle in the desert. The Talmud states that Betzalel had been chosen to build this Taber­nacle because he \"knew how to permute the letters with which heaven and earth were created. \"34 Such esoteric knowledge was required, since the Tabernacle was meant to be a microcosm, paralleling both t he universe, the spiritual domain, and the human body.35 It was not enough merely to construct a physical building. As it was built, the architect had to meditate on the meaning of each part, imbuing it with the necessary spiritual properties. The Talmud derives this fr om the verse where God says, \"I have called in the name of Betzalel... and I have filled him with the spirit of God, with wisdom, understanding, and knowledge\" (Exodus 31:2-3). \"Wisdom, Understanding and Knowledge\" (Chakhmah, Binah and Daat) refer to states of consciousness, which we shall dis­cuss at length. It is through the manipulation of the letters that such states of consciousness can be attained. The sources are silent about the Sefer Yetzirah t hen until the time of Jeremiah t he prophet. Here again we find a tradition that Jeremiah wished to make use of Sefer Yetzirah, but as in the case of Abraham, was admonished not to attempt to do so alone. He there"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"I 111 rod/{( 'I ion X\\' fore took his son. Ben Sirah, and the two explored these mysteries together. 36 Through their efforts, they were able to create a Golem, but they did not preserve it. There might have been more than one person with the name Ben Sirah, but the one in t his tradition was clearly the son of Jeremiah. Regard ing his birth, there is a fascinating tradition. Jeremiah had been accosted by homosexuals in the bathhouse, and as a result, had experienced an ejaculation in the tub. His semen remained viable, and when his daughter later used the same tub, she was impregnated by it, eventually giving birth to Ben SirahY Ben Sirah was therefore the son of both Jeremiah and the latter's daughter. Some sources say that his name was originally Ben Zera (Son of Seed), but when this name proved embarrassing, he changed it to Ben Sirah. 38 Because of the sensitive nature of his birth, he did not call himself \"son of Jeremiah.\" There is an allusion, however, since Sirah (K1'0) and Jeremiah (1:1'01') both have a numerical value of 271. Later authorities were to bring proof fr om this incident that artificial insemination does not constitute adultery or incest. 39 These traditions are of particular interest, since there are many h ints that Jeremiah taught these mysteries to a certain Yosef, son of U ziel, son of Ben Sirah. 40 There is also at least one source that states that Ben Sirah actually taught the Sefer Yetzirah to Yosefben Uziel.41 What is even more interesting is the fact that there are hints that this very same Yosefben Uziel may have written a commentary on Sefer Yetzirah, or even possibly one of the earli est versions of the text itselfY This is important because it would date the first version of Sefer Y etzirah to the early years of the Second Temple. This was a lso the time of the Great Assembly, who put some of the last books of the Bible, such as Ezekiel, into w riting, and then closed the Biblical Can­non.43 Much of the regular Hebrew prayer service was also composed by this Assembly.44 Like these prayers, the Sefer Yetzirah was not put into writing, but was taught fr om memory. The Talmudic Period Upon entering the Talmudic period, we make a transition fr om tradi­tion to history. We find actual mention of Sefer Yetzirah in the Tal­mud, and even though it is not absolutely certain that it is identical with our version, there is no real reason to doubt that they are one and the same. In Talm udical times, the Sefer Y etzirah began as an oral teaching, and was eventually incorporated as a book, which was used by the sages."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"XVI SEFER YETZIRAH The first reference to such use involves Rabbi Yehoshua [ben Chananya], a leading sage of the first century. He is credited with the statement. \"I can take squashes and pumpkins, and w ith the Sefer Yetzirah, make them into beautiful trees. These will in turn produce other beautiful t rees. \"45 Although the phrase, \"with the Sefer Yetzirah.\" does not occur in printed edit ions of t he Jerusalem Tal­mud, it is found in manuscripts. This reference to Rabbi Y ehoshua is highly significant. Rabbi Yehoshua was one of the five main disciples of Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai ( 4 7 seE-7 3 cE), leader of all Jewry after the destruction of the Temple. and a renowned expert in all occult arts.46 It was Rabbi Yehoshua who was Rabbi Yochanan' s main disciple in the mysteries of the Markava (Chariot), and he later gained fame as the greatest expert of his time in the occultY This also sheds light on another important mystical personality. According to one ancient source, Rabbi Yehoshua also received the tradition fr om Rabbi Nehunia ben HaKanah, leader of the school that produced the Bahir. In Sefe r HaTagin, we find that the tradition regarding the mystical significance of the crowns (tagin) on Hebrew letters was handed down in the following manner: \"Menachem gave it over to Rabbi Nehunia ben HaKanah, Rabbi Nehunia ben HaKanah gave it over to Rabbi E lazar ben Arakh, Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh gave it over to Rabbi Yehoshua, and Rabbi Yehoshua gave it over to Rabbi Akiba. \"4R Rabbi E laz ar ben Arakh is best known as the greatest disciple of Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai.4� It is also known that he learned the Markava mysteries fr om R abbi Yochanan.5° From the above tradi­tion, we also see that he learned fr om Rabbi Nehunia, possibly after he left Rabbi Yochanan. The Talmud reports that at this point, Rabbi Elazar went to live by the river Dismas, in the town of Emmaus.51 Emmaus, however, is also known to be the place of Rabbi Nehunia, as well as a general seat of Kabbalistic teaching.5� It is quite possible that Rabbi E lazar became so involved in mysticism, that, as the Tal­mud reports. he lost his grasp of legalistic theory. Also significant is the fact that Rabbi Nehunia is said to have received the tradition from Menachem. It is known that Rabbi Nehunia was the leading mystic of the fi rst century, as well as a col­league of Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai.53 There are, however, no records as to whom his masters were . From the Sefe r HaTagin we learn that Rabbi Nehunia learned at least some of the mysteries fr om Menachem. who served as vice president of the Sanhedrin (Supreme Court) under Hillel. It was when Menachem resigned his post that Shammai was appointed in his stead. 54"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"ln/n)(/u,·rwn X\\\"11 Most authorities identify this individual with Menachem the Essene, discussed by Josephus.55 Menachem had once seen Herod as a child, and had prophecized that he would be king. Because of this, when Herod later ascended the throne, he honored Menachem as well as the other Essenes. Due to his relationship with Herod, Menachem could no longer maintain his positio n in the Sanhedrin. If we accept the above tradition, Nehunia ben HaKanah might have received at least some of his mystic knowledge fr om Menachem the Essene. This would indicate that the Essenes were conversant in the mystical arts, and that they taught them to at least some of the Talmudic masters. Josephus states that the Essenes made use of the names of angels, and were able to fortell the future, using various purifications and methods of the prophets. 56 Even more significant, Josephus also likens the Essenes to the PythagoreansY Since the Sefer Yetzirah apparently contains some elements that resemble the teachings of the Pythagoreans, it may be that the text was preserved by the Essenes during the period that preceded the Talmud. Rabbi Elazar taught the tradition regarding the crowns on letters to Rabbi Yehoshua, who in turn gave it over to Rabbi Akiba (12-132 cE). Rabbi Akiba excelled in this area, and the Talmud reports that he could derive many important teachings fr om these crowns.58 He also received the Markava tradition fr om Rabbi Yehoshua, as well as other important occult lore. 5 9 There is no question that in his time, Rabbi Akiba was considered the greatest of all experts in the mystical realm. 60 Rabbi Shimeon bar Yochai, author of the Zohar, was also a disciple of Rabbi Akiba. It is therefore not surprising that a number of sources attribute the authorship of Sefer Yetzirah to Rabbi Akiba.61 Most of the early Talmud ical texts originated with Rabbi Akiba, who transmitted them orally in a well defined form.62 Although these books were not written down, they had been worded by Rabbi Akiba, and it was his wording that was taught orally. At that time, there was a rule that the oral tradition be reviewed exactly, word for word, precisely as they had been given over. the rule was, \"One should always reveiw the precise wording of his mas­ter.\"63 Each master would therefore provide a program of study, which his disciples would memorize word for word. In the legalistic field, this was known as the \"First Mishnah.\"64 It is possible that Rabbi Akiba also produced an oral text of Sefer Yetzirah for his stu­dents of mystical lore to memorize. Besides this, personal notes may also have been kept. In this respect, the Sefer Yetzirah would have been no different than the rest of the oral tradition. A lthough it was meant to be trans-"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"\\\\Ill SEFER YETZIRAH mitted by word of mouth, and was not actually published, personal records and manuscripts were kept.65 This was especially true of important teachings that were not usually reviewed in the academies, as well as esoteric texts.66 Similarly, the heads of the academies would keep written notes in order to accurately preserve the traditionsY Although these notes were never published, they were carefully preserved in the academies. Subsequent teachers often added mar­ginal notes to these manuscripts, and such notes were even occasion­ally found in the Biblical scrolls which they used.68 Since these notes were preserved by private individuals and never distributed publically, they were collectively known as \"hidden scrolls\" (Megillat Setarim).69 Not only such esoteric material as Sefer Yetzirah was included in this category, but even such legalistic material as the Mishnah, which was meant to be transmitted orally. This might help explain why the Sefer Yetzirah exists in so many versions. Unlike the Mishnah, which was eventually published in a well defined edition, the Sefer Yetzirah never developed beyond the state of being a \"hidden scroll.\" Different versions may have been taught by various teachers, and, since the text was never openly pub­lished, there was no way in which these versions could be compared and corrected. Furthermore, many marginal notes may have been incorporated into the text, also producing different versions. All this may provide an explanation for the fact that there is no Hebrew clas­sic that is found with so many versions and variants as the Sefer Yetzirah. It seems highly probable that the Sefer Yetzirah was already in its present form when the Mishnah was redacted in the year 204 cE. The Mishnah was edited by Rabbi Yehudah the Prince (135-220 cE), usually referred to simply as \"Rebbi.\" It is indeed possible that there is a reference to Sefer Yetzirah in the Mishnah itself. In one of the few places where it d iscusses esoteric lore, the Mishnah states, \"The mysteries of creation (Maaseh Bereshit) may not be expounded in the presence of two disciples, and the mysteries of the Markava (Maaseh .Warkara) may not be expounded even in the presence of one, unless he is wise, understanding with his knowledge. \"70 The term Maaseh Merkava refers to the meditative methods used to ascend to the higher spiritual realms. 71 Although such later philoso­phers as Maimonides claimed that this involved philosophical specula­tion, the most ancient sources clearly state that Maaseh Markava dealt with the meditative methods used for spiritual ascent. 72 As such, it was considered the most esoteric of all spiritual exercises. According to many authorities, Maaseh Bereshit refers to the mysteries of Sefer Yetzirah.71 Since we know that Maaseh Markara was of mystical nature, it would be logical to assume that the same was true of Maaseh Bereshit. Furthermore, t he assumption that"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"fll/l\"lid/lc/1011 XIX Maaseh Bereshit involves Sefer Yetzirah also clarifies a number of otherwise obscure Talmudical references. There is also evidence that Rebbi was familia r with the mysteries of the Markava, and it is logi­cal to assume that he was also aware of Sefer Yetzirah. 74 A generation later, we thus find a n account of two of Rebbi's disciples clearly involved in the mysteries of Sefer Yetzirah. The Tal­mud relates, \"Rabbi Hanina and Rabbi Hoshia would engage them­selves in Sefer Yetzirah every [Friday] before the Sabbath, would cre­ate for t hemselves a prime75 calf, and would eat it.\" 76 Another version of this account states that they engaged in Hi/khat Yetzirah (Rules of Creation), rather than Sefer Yetzirah. 77 The term Hi/khat, however, can apply t o philosophical rules as well as legal ones. n In some of the most ancie n t manuscripts, Sefer Yetzirah is actually titled Hi/khat Yetzirah. 79 There are many interpretations as to exactly what these two sages accomplished in creating such a calf, and why they did it. Some say that they did not actually create a physical calf, but created such a clear meditative image that t he spiritual sati sfaction was the same as eating. 80 Even such a Kabbalist as Abraham A bulafia (1240-1296) maintains that their creation was mystical rather than physical.8 1 The Rashba (Rabbi Shlomo ben Aderet: 1235-131 0) saw particular signi­ficance in the fact that they would engage in this on Friday, the day in which mammals were originally created.81 This entire question will be discussed further in our commentary. Evidently, Rebbi also taught these mysteries to his disciple Rav (Abba Arikhta), who in turn taught them to Rav Yehudah (220-299 cE), founder and first master of the Babylonian academy in Pumpadita. This Rav Yehudah, together with Rav Aina, were called the \"elders of Pumpadita. \" 81 The Talmud relates that the \"elders of Pumpadita were versed (tanu) in Maaseh Bereshit.\"84 From t h e use of the word tanu here, it is evident that Maaseh Bereshit already existed in a definite form, most probably as a written book. 8 5 This would suggest that Sefer Yetzirah had already been put in writing. There is also other evidence that Rav Yehudah learned the mys­teries of Sefer Yetzirah from Rav. The teaching, \"Betzal el knew how to permute the letters with which heaven and earth were created, \" is attributed to \"Rav Yehudah in the name of Rav.\"86 Also attributed to him is the statement that God told Abraham to \" go out of your astrology. \"87 This indicates that he had some evidence that Abraham was versed in astrology, a position clearly found in Sefer Yetzirah. There is also evidence that Rav Yehudah learned the mysteries of the 42 letter Name fr om Rav.88 As an initiate into the mysteries of Sefer Yetzirah, Rav Yehudah would also have a deep understanding of the mystical significance of the Hebrew l anguage. We thus find that he emphasized the use of the"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"\\.\\ SEFER YETZI R -\\H Hebrew language, even in his daily conversation.89 Rav Yehudah also maintained that prayer should be voiced in Hebrew, and not in the Aramaic vernacular. 90 The Talmud relates that Rav Yosef knew the mysteries of the Markava. while the \"elders of Pumpadita\" were versed in the myster­ies of creation. Rav Yosef got the elders to teach him the mysteries of creation. but would not entrust them with the Markava mysteries in return.91 This indicates that the mysteries of the Markava and those of Sefer Yetzirah were taught by different schools, and that members of one school did not know the teachings of the other. The two involved different disciplines, and care was taken to keep them separate. This also answers the question as to why the Sefer Yetzirah is never men­tioned in the 1/('kha/ot. the classic of Markava literature. 92 The Markava literature developed in a school that might have not had access to Sefer Yetzirah, even though certain of its members were definitely versed in it. In the same context, Sefer Yetzirah is men­tioned but a very few times in the Zohar, and then , not in the main text. 93 In that period, there were some sages who eschewed these mys­teries completely. Such an individual was Rabbi Elazar ben Padat, who headed the academy in Tiberius after the death of Rabbi Yochanan in the year 279 cE. When Rabbi Yochanan had offered to teach him the Markava mysteries, he deferred on the grounds that h e was too young. After Rabbi Yochanan's death, when Rabbi Assi wished to impart these mysteries to him. he again deferred, saying, \"If I would have been worthy, I would have learned them from Rabbi Yochanan your master. \"94 Instead, Rabbi Elazar adopted a position somewhat opposed to the esoteric schools, accepting the viewpoint of Rabbi Yosi ben Zimra. Denying that the Sefer Yetzirah could be used to actually cre­ate life. he said in the name of Rabbi Yosi. \"If all the people in the world came together, they could not create a gnat and imbue it with a soul. \"95 It was not that Rabbi Elazar doubted that such powers existed. Rather, he felt that they were no longer known. These pow­ers. however. d i d exist in the Torah. Rabbi Elazar thus said, \"The paragraphs of the Torah are not in order. If they were in [c orrect] order. anyone who read them would be able to [create a world,] resur­rect the dead. and perform miracles.\" 9\" A generation later. we find two important sages actively engaged in the mysteries of Sefer Yetzirah. The fi rst was Rava (299-353 cE), founder and first master of the Babylonian academy in Mechuza, who is credited with saying. \"If the righteous desired, they could cre­ate a world.\" 97 His partner was Rav Zeira. w ho was known as the"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"tnt n Hluct ion XXI \"saint of Babylon.\"n So great were Rav Zeira's meditative powers that he was able to place his feet in fire without burning them. He would test himself each month to see if this power was unabated. On one occasion. the other sages distracted him, and he failed. where­upon he was called, \"The little man with the burned feet. \"99 An ancient tradition states that Rava and Rav Zeira worked together for three years, meditating on t he Sefer Yetzirah. When they finally mastered it, they created a calf and slaughtered it, serving it at a feast celebrating their accomplishment. They then lost their pow­ers and had to work for another three years to restore them.100 The Talmud relates that \" Rava created a man\" and sent him to Rav Zeira. When the latter saw that this android would n ot answer his questions, he realized that it was a Golem, and told it to \"return to the dust.\"101 The Bahir remarks that the Golem could not speak because Rava was not completely free from the taint of sin, and as long as man sins, he cannot partake of the powers of the Creator.10� Only God can make a man who can speak. This i s the first mention of the creation of a Golem in Hebraic literature, but in the middle ages. several other instances are reported.103 Even the expression, \"Rava created a man,\" has mystical conno­tations. In the original, it is RaBhA BaRA GaBhRA (1'(1Jl 1'(1:1 1'(:11), and, as an early Kabbalist notes, the second word is nothing other than the reverse of the first. 104 The third word adds a Gimmel, the third letter of the alphabet, to the word before it. This yields a phrase consisting of ten letters, with a numerical value of 612, one less than 613, the number of bones and blood vessels in the human body.105 The man created by Rava was thus something less than human. In many ways, this expression is reminiscent of the word Abracadabra (ABRA K'ADaBRA-�n::J1�o 1'(1::11'(), which literally means, \"I will create as I speak.\"106 During t he Talmudic period, there were many sages who engaged in these mysteries. 107 With the close of this era, however, a blanket of silence was cast over all occult activities. It appears that a number of mystical books were written during the subsequent Gaonic period, but their origins are shrouded in mystery. Still, k nowledge of these practices clearly existed as late as the I Oth century, and Hai Gaon (939- 1 038) speaks of people engaged in the mystical permutation (l:::eruf) of letters.10� Texts and Commentaries It is not until the post-Talmudic period that we find actual quotations fr om the Sefer Yetzirah.

He writes:10Y Then. from eternity, with Ten Sayings You gouged With Scribe, script and scroll-Ten. Y ou finished them in six directions, Ten words. There arc also allusions to the teachings of Sefer Yetzirah in Bercita dcShmuel HaKatan, which, according to internal evidence, was written in or around 776 cE.110 There is also a mention of the \"Ten Sefirot of Nothingness\" in a late Midrash, which could have been redacted around this time.111 The absence of any unambiguous references to Sefer Yetzirah in earlier literature has led some historians to speculate whether or not the Talmudic citations are referring to our text. Some maintain that our version was written much later than the Talmud. A list of such estimates in given in Table I. The most careful analysis, however, reveals a number of strata in the text. The earliest parts of the book appear very ancient, possibly antedating the Talmudic era.112 A considerable amount of the text appears to have been added later on, possibly as a glossary or commen­tary. As some of the earliest commentators on Sefer Yetzirah note, com­mentaries and marginal notes were occasionally incorporated into the text.113 In the lOth century, Rabbi Yaakov ben Nissim writes, \"People write Hebrew comments on the book, and other foolish people come later and comment on the commentary. Between them, truth is lost.\"114 This is not surprising, since in Talmudic times, such marginal notes were even common in Biblical scrolls, although enough was known of their text, that the comments were not incorporated into it. Several strata are evident in Sefer Yetzirah, some apparently added in the late Talmudic period, and others in the Gaonic era."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"\\\\1\\ SEFER YETZIR·\\H Thus, critical estimates as to its age would depend on which parts were studied. The earliest commentaries on Sefer Yetzirah were written in the I Oth century. The first was written in 931 by Saadia Gaon, one of the most important religious leaders and philosophers of his time. The second. Chakamoni. was written by Rabbi Shabbatai Donnelo in 946. while the third was written by Donash ibn Tamim a decade later.115 All of these are philosophical, rather than mystical, in content. Most significant is the fact that each of these commentaries was written on a different version of Sefer Yetzirah. The commentary by Donash was written on what is now generally referred to as t he Short Version. With minor variations. it was this version that was printed in 1562 in the Mantua edition, and it is dominant in all subsequent printed editions. The commentary of Shabbatiai Donnelo was written on what is now referred to as the Long Version. Many printed editions included this Long Version as a sort of appendix. A complete manuscript, dat­ing fr om the I Oth century, also exists of this version. Although there are important differences in the assignment of values to letters and planets. the Long Version is very much like the Short Version with an additional commentary. This is particularly evident in the sixth chapter, where we find a commentary on the first stanza of the book. Also significant are some recaps ( 4: 14, 5:20), which are actually revi­sions of the previous text. The existence of both a Short and Long Version was noted as early as t he 13th century by Abraham Abulafia.111' The third version is that of Saadia Gaon, which is also found in some early Geniza fragments. This is very much like the Long Ver­sion. except that the stanzas are in completely different order. This variant, usually called the Saadia Version, has been virtually ignored by the Kabbalists, even though it was apparently used by Rabbi Yehudah HaLevi in his Kuzari. As early as the I Oth century, Saadia Gaon remarked about the many variants of Sefer Yetzirah. saying, \"It is not a common book, and many people have been careless in changing or transposing the text.\"117 A century later. Rabbi Yehudah Barceloni likewise notes that. \"there are many versions, some very confused.\" 11R In 1562, the printers of the first Mantua edition remarked how they had to sift through many manuscripts to find a dependable text. If all the variants found in manuscripts are counted, there are literally dozens of different variants in the text of Sefer Y etzirah. No other Judaic text exists in so many versions. Some of these might"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"!mroducrion XX\\ have come fr om different schools, who, because these teachings were secret, did not communicate with each other. Different marginal notes and commentaries also apparently became incorporated into the text, producing different variants. Furthermore, if t he text was preserved orally for a long time, variants in its ordering may have also developed. Besides this, there is another possibility, suggested by the fact that, in essence, the Kabbalists rejected all the above mentioned ver­sions. It is known that during the Gaonic period (6th-1 0th centuries), the Kabbalists restricted their teachings to very small secret societies. Great stress was placed o n maintaining secrecy so that their teachings should not fall into improper hands. Since Sefer Yetzirah is such a small book, it presented t he greatest danger. The leaders of these schools may have deliberately released spurious versions, so as to confuse those who would be tempted to penetrate their mysteries. With several versions in circulation, the uninitiated would not know which to choose. It was the Kabbalists themselves who preserved the correct text, initially concealing it from outsiders. Around 155 0, Rabbi Moshe Cordevero, leader of the Safed school and the greatest Kabbalist of the day, sifted through the ten best manuscripts available, choosing the one most closely fitting the tradition of the Kabbalists.119 A gene­ration later, the text was further refined by the Ari (Rabbi Yitzchak L uria), one of the greatest Kabbalists of all time. This text, known as the Ari Version, was published a number of times, usually as part of some other collection. It resembles the Short Version in many ways, but there are some very significant differences in assignment. In gen­eral, the Ari Version is the only one which is in agreement with the Zohar. A number of variations were found even in this version, and a final edited text was finally produced by the Gra (Rabbi Eliahu, Gaon of Vilna) in the 18th century.120 This is known as the Gra-Ari Ver­s ion, or simply, as the Gra Version. Thus, there are four important versions of Sefer Yetzirah. They are: I) The Short Version 2) The Long Version 3) The Saadia Version 4) The Gra Version. Since the Gra Version was considered the most authentic by the Kabbalists, this is the one that we have chosen for the initial transla-"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":".\\X \\\"I SEFER YETZIR\\H tion and commentary. The other three versions are presented in Appendix I. Over eighty commentaries have been written on Sefer Yetzirah. Some. especially the earliest. were primarily philosophical. With the emergence of Kabbalah as a public teaching. a number of Kabbalistic and mystical commentaries were also written. When the Bahir and the Zohar were published. commentators worked to fit the Sefer Y ctzirah into the system of these texts. The same was true o f t he teachings of the Ari. which dominates the later comment aries. A his­tory of the commentaries on Sefer Yetzirah reads very much like a history of the K abbalah in general. A list of the major commentaries is found in the Bibliography.

Therefore, plurality only came into existence with the advent of creation. Only then could numbers be defined. The first elements of plurality in creation involved t h e Ten Sefirot. Hence, it was t he Sefirot t hat defined the numbers, and t here­fore, the concept of quantity in general. Most of Sefer Yetzirah will deal with these 32 paths, as they are manifest in the letters and numbers. The 32 paths, themselves, how­ever, will not be mentioned again. The early Kabbalists define these 32 paths as d ifferent states of consciousness. A list of these is given in Appendix II. According to the Kabbalists, these 32 paths are alluded to in the Torah by the 32 times that God's name Elohim appears in the account of creation in the first chapter of Genesis. 2 In this account, the expres­sion \" God sai d\" appears ten times, and these are the Ten Sayings with which the world was created.1 These Ten Sayings parallel the Ten Sefirot. 4 The first saying is said to be the verse, \"In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth\" (Genesis 1:1) . Even though \"God said\" does not appear here, it is implied and understood. 5 The other 22 times that God's name appears in this account then parallel the 22 letters of the alphabet. The three times in which the expression \"God made\" appears parallel the three Mothers. The seven repititions of \"God saw\" parallel t he seven Doubles. The remaining twelve names parallel the twelve Elementals. See Table 2. In general, none of the names of God refer to the Creator Him­self. The Creator is only referred to as Ain Sof, which means t he Infi­nite Being, or simply, the Infinite. The names used in scripture and e l sewhere merely refer to the various ways through which God mani­fests Himself in creation. The name Elohim, which is used throughout the first chapter of Genesis, refers to the manifestation of delineation and definition.

Man is seen as a microcosm, with each thing in his body paralleling something in the forces of creation. Thus, for example, the six days of creation have parallels in man's two arms, two legs, torso and sexual organ. This is the significance of the Torah' s statement that God formed man \"in the image of God\" (Gen­esis 1 :27). Note that the word for \"God\" here is Elohim. This is because man's form parallels the structure of the deli neating forces that define creation. The Kabbalists note that the 32 paths of Wisdom have their par­allel in the human nervous system.6 Thirty-one of these paths then"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Chapter One 9 parallel the 31 nerves that eminate fr om the spinal cord . The thirty­second and highest path corresponds to the entire complex of cranial nerves, which are twelve in number. The n ervous system serves a double purpose. First, it transmits messages fr om the brain to all parts of the body, allowing the mind to control the limbs and organs. Secondly, the nervous system trans­mits information fr om the various senses to the brain. Four of t he senses, sight, hearing, taste and smell, come directly through t he cra­nial nerves, which are entirely in the brain. The impulses that come from the lower 31 nerves deal primarily with the sense of touch and feeling. Like the nerves, each of the 32 paths is a two way street. First it is the channel through which the Mind exerts control over creation. Secondly, however, it is also the path t hrough which man can reach the Mind. If an individual wishes to attain a mystical experience and approach the Mind, he must travel along the 32 paths. In Hebrew, the number 32 is written Lamed Bet (J'?). This spells Lev, the Hebrew word for heart. 7 It is in the heart t hat the action of the Mind is manifest in the body. As soon as the influence of the mind ceases, the heart ceases to function, this being the definition of death. The heart also provides lifeforce to the brain and nervous sys­tem. When t he heart stops pumping, the nervous system can no longer function, and the mind no longer exerts influence on t he body. The heart therefore serves as a casual link between mind and body.8 I t is for this reason that Sefer Y etzirah calls the heart \"the king over the soul\" (6:3). I t also describes the mystical experience as a \"running of the heart\" (I :8). The Tora h is seen as the heart of creation. Th e first letter of the Torah is the Bet (.::1) of Bereshit (I1't7�i.::l )-\"ln the beginning.\" The last letter of the Torah is the Lamed ('?) of Yisrael ('?�;w•)-\"Israel.\" Together, these two letters also spell out Lev (J?), meaning heart.9 The 32 paths are contained in the Torah, which is t he means through which the Mind is revealed. I t is also the link between the Mind and the physical universe. The Torah is therefore expounded in 32 differ­ent ways, as taught by Rabbi Yosi of Galili. The two letters Lamed ('?) and Bet (J) also share another unique distinction. As a prefix, Lamed means \"to,\" and Bet means \" in.\" The three l etters of the Tetragrammaton, Yud (•), Heh (:-t), and Vav (1), can also serve as suffixes for personal pronouns. The suffix Yud means \"me,\" Heh means \"her,\" and V av means \"him.\""},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"10 SEFER YETZIRAH In the entire alphabet, there are only two letters to which these suffixes can be joined, and these are Lamed and Bet. These then spell out the words: Li Lah La •l:? to me ;,l:? to her 1� to him Bi Bah Eo '' in me :1::1 in her 1::1 in him The two letters. Lamed and Bet, are the only ones in the entire alpha­bet which combine with the letters of the divine name in this manner.10 The number 32 is the fifth power of two (25). As the Sefer Yetzirah explains (I :5), the Ten Sefirot define a five dimensional space. The 32 paths correspond to the number of apexes on a five dimensional hypercube.11 This is not as difficult as it might seem. A line, which has one dimension, has two (21) apexes or ends. A square, having two dimen­sions. has four (22) apexes or corners. A cube, which has three dimen­sions. has eight (23) corners. We thus see that with the addition of each dimension, the number of apexes is doubled. A four dimen­sional hypercube has 16 or 24 apexes, while a five dimensional hypercube has 32 or 25 apexes. Pa ths The Hebrew word for \"paths\" here is Netivot (111:J'm), a word that occurs only rarely in scripture. Much more common is the word Derekh (111). As the Zohar states, however, there is an important dif­ference between these two words. A Derekh is a public road, a route used by all people. A Nativ, on the other hand, is a personal route, a path blazed by the individual for his personal useY It is a hidden path. without markers or signposts, which one must discover on his own, and tread by means of his own devices. The 32 paths of Wisdom are therefore called Netivot. They are private paths, which must be blazed by each individual. There is no open highway to the mysteries-each individual must discover his own path. The numerical value of Nativ (::1'1\"1)) is 462. This is twice the num­ber of the 231 Gates discussed below (2:4 ). These gates are a means through which one ascends and descends along the 32 paths."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Chapter One II Mystical These paths are said to be mystical, Peliyot (.n11'('t,!l) in Hebrew. This comes fr om the root Pala (1-(�!l), which has the connotation of being hidden and separated from the world at large.13 Not only are these paths individual, but they are hidden, concealed and transcendental. This is very closely related to the word Peleh (1-(t,!l), meaning a miracle. A miracle is separated and independent fr om the laws of the physical world. It is also influenced by hidden forces. As such, it is a link with the mystical and transcendental plane. The same is true of the paths of Wisdom. According to the Zohar, the word Peleh specifically relates to the paths of Wisdom.14 The type of miracle denoted by the word Peleh is specifically one that is accomplished through the manipulation of these paths. The methods of manipulating these paths is one of the important teachings of Sefer Yetzirah. The Sefer Yetzirah later calls the three Mothers, \"a great mysti­cal (muPhLA) secret\" (3:2). The first of the three Mothers is Aleph (!'(). When spelled out, Aleph ('1�1'() has the same letters as Peleh (l'(�!l).1 5 Accord ing to the Kabbalists, the letter Aleph denotes Keter (Crown), the highest of the Sefirot. 16 It is with regard to Keter that Ben Sirah said, \"In what is mysterious (muPhLA) for you, do not seek.\" 17 The Kabbalists call Keter the level of Nothingness (Ayin).18 It i s on this level that the laws of nature cease to exist, and can therefore be altered. As the book Raziel points out, the three letters of Peleh (1-(t,!l) rep­resent increasingly hidden values.1 9 According to the phonetic fami­lies defined by Sefer Yetzirah (2:3), the first letter, Peh (!>), is pro­nounced with the lips, the second letter, Lamed (�), with the middle of the tongue, and the final Alef (!'(), with the throat. Thus, the first letter is pronounced with the outermost revealed part of the mouth, while the last is voiced with the innermost concealed part. The word Peleh thus denotes the transition fr om the revealed to the concealed. Wisdom These 32 paths are said to be paths of Wisdom (Chakh mah). In a Kabbalistic sense, Wisdom is seen as pure, undifferentiated Mind.20 It is pure thought, which has not yet been broken up into differenti-"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"12 SEFER YETZIRAH ated ideas. Wisdom is the level above all division, where everything is a simple unity. It is in recognition of this that the Talmud states, \" Who is wise (Chakham)? He who learns fr om every man.\"21 It is on the level of Wisdom that all men are one. Hence, if one is on this level, he must learn fr om every human being, and indeed, fr o m all creation. Accord ing to the Baal Shem Tov, this means that a person on the level of Wisdom must even learn from Evil.22 It is only on levels below Wisdom that people are separated into different individuals. Only on lower levels does the division between good and evil exist. The Talmud likewise states, \" Who is wise? He who perceives the future.\"\"1 This is because Wisdom is the pure mind force that tran­scends time. On the level of Wisdom. past, present and future have not yet been separated. Hence, on this level, one can see the future just like the past and present. The antithesis of Wisdom is Understanding. The Hebrew word for Understanding is Binah (:-tJ'J). which comes fr om the root Beyn (p::J). meaning \" between.\"2 4 Understanding is the level immediately below Wisdom. It is on the level of Understanding that ideas exist separately, where they can be scrutinized and comprehended. While Wisdom is pure undifferen­tiated Mind, Understanding is the level where division exists, and where things are deli neated and defined as separated objects. On the level of Wisdom, all men are included in a single world soul. Understanding is the level of Neshamah, where the soul of each individual assumes a distinct identity, and each one is seen as a sepa­rate entity. The divine name associated with Understanding is Elohim.25 This is a plural word, since Understanding implies a plurality of forces. It is the name Elohim that is used throughout the entire first chapter of Genesis in describing the act of creation. The 32 times that this name occurs correspond to the 32 paths of Wisdom. This resolves an important d ifficulty. If Wisdom is a simple undifferentiated Mind, how can it be manifest as 32 distinct paths? But actually, Wisdom is undifferentiated, and it is only through the power of Understanding that it is divided into separated paths. These paths are therefore designated by the name Elohim, the name associ­ated w ith Understanding. An example would be water flowing through a system of pipes. Water itself is an undifferentiated fluid, having no essential (macro­scopic) structure. Structure is only imposed on it when it flows through the system of pipes. In the analogy, Wisdom is the water, while Understanding represents the pipes that channel it."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Chapter One 13 The 32 paths are expressed as the letters and numbers. Since these represent division, they are manifestations of Understanding. 26 Hence, Wisdom represents nonverbal thought, while Understanding is its verb alization. In this respect, Wisdom and Understanding are seen as being male and female respectively. In the Kabbalah, Wisdom is seen as the Father (Abba), while Understanding is the Mother (lmmah). The male represents unchanneled creative force. This can only be brought into frui t ion when delineated, enclosed and channeled by the female womb. It is for this reason that the Sefer Yetzirah (1 :2) calls the pri­mary letters \"Mothers.\" This also resolves another difficulty. Earlier, we said that the 32 paths represent the heart, since the Hebrew word for heart, Lev, actu­ally spells out the number 32. The heart, however, is normally associ­ated with Understanding, while these paths are said to pertain to Wisdom.2 7 But the paths merely channel Wisdom, while the sub­stance of the paths themselves is Understanding.28 Engraved The text states that the Creator used these 32 paths to \"engrave\" so as to create His universe. The Hebrew word here is Chakak (ppn). This usually has the con­notation of removing material, as in the verse, \"Engrave (chakak) yourself a dwelling in a rock\" (Isaiah 22: 16). Derived fr om this root are the words Chok (pm) and Ch ukah (;,pm), meaning \"rule\" and \"decree,\" since rules and laws serve to remove some of the individual's fr eedom of action. 29 Thus, the word Chakak is closely related to Ma-chak (pno), meaning \"to erase,\" as well as to the root La-kach (npS), meaning to \" remove\" or \" take. \"30 The word Chakak is very closely related to the concept of writ­ing.31 The main difference between engraving (chakak) and writing is that when one writes, one adds material such as ink to t he writing surface, while when one engraves, one removes material. When the Bible uses the work Chakak to designate writing, it is referring to such systems as cuneiform, where the text was written by removing wedges of clay fr om a tablet. To understand why the author uses the term \"engraved\" here, we must understand the i dea of creation. Before a universe could be created, empty space had to exist in which it could be made. But ini­tially, only God existed, and all existence was fi lled with t he Divine"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"14 SEFER YETZIRAH Essence. the Light of the Infinite (Or A in Sof). It was out of this undifferentiated Essence that a Vacated space had to be engraved. The process, known to the Kabbalists as the Tz imtzum (Constric­tion), is clearly described in the Zohar:32 In the beginning of the King's authority The Lamp of Darkness Engraved a hollow in the Supernal Luminescence ... The hollow engraved in the Supernal Luminescence was the Vacated Space, in which all creation subsequently occured. The undifferentiated Light of the Infinite which existed before the Constriction is on the level of Wisdom, which is pure undeline­ated Mind. The power of constriction is that of Understanding, this being what the Zohar calls the \" Lamp of Darkness.\" It is negative light, or negative existence, which can engrave a hollow in the Divine Essence. This Constriction or hollowing of the Divine Essence did not occur in physical space, but rather, in conceptual space. I t is \"hollow\" insofar as it contains the possibility for information, but not actual information. As such, it is the \"Chaos and Void\" (Tohu and Bohu) mentioned in the account of creation, where the Scripture states, \" the earth was chaos and void\" (Genesis I :2). Chaos is a state where infor­mation can exist, but where it does not exist.33 The hollow was made through the 32 paths, since letters and dig­its are the basic bits of information. While random letters and num­bers do not actually convey information, as long as they exist, it is also possible for information to exist. The Vacated Space is therefore the state where it is possible for information to exist, but where this possibility has not yet been realized. These letters were subsequently combined into words, forming the Ten Sayings of creation. Each of these sayings brought informa­tion into the Vacated Space. through which creation could take place there. The order was therefore first \"engraving,\" and then \"creation.\" The Sefer Yetzirah therefore states that the Creator \"engraved ... and created His universe.\" Engraved Ya h Many of the Kabbalistic commentaries translate this as \"He engraved Yah .... \" In Hebrew, the word \"he\" is often not written out. but understood fr om the verbal form. The \"He\" here refers to the Infinite Being (Ain Sof) who is above all the divine Names.34"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Chapter One 15 According to this, the Sefer Yetzirah is saying that the Infinite Being began creation by engraving the divine Names through the 32 paths of Wisdom. The Names are written with letters, and they could only come into being after the letters had been created. It is in the same vein that some of the early Kabbalists interpret the first verse in Genesis to read, \"In the beginning He created Elohim, along with the heaven and the earth. \"35 The first thing that the Infinite Being created was the name Elohim, which is associated with the Constriction. The divine Names also parallel the Sefirot. Once the Vacated Space had been engraved, the Sefirot could be created inside it. The \"engraving\" of this Space was therefore intimately related to these Names. This can also be read in the imperative, \"With 32 mystical paths of Wisdom, engrave Yah ... and create His world.\" The term \"engrave\" here would mean to form a clear mental image of the Name, so as to meditate on it, as we will discuss later (1:14 ). The method is alluded to in Rava's saying, \"If the righteous desired, they could create a world. \"36 Ya h Saadia Gaon translates this as, \"the Eternal.\" The Kabbalists normatively associate the name Yah (:1') with Wisdom (Chakhmah). Actually, however, only the first letter of this name, the Yud ('),designates Wisdom. The second letter, Heh (:1) des­ignates Understanding, the feminine principle. The reason why this name as a whole is used to designate Wis­dom is because Wisdom cannot be grasped except when it is clothed in Understandi ng. For this reason, the Yud alone is not used as the name for Wisdom, but rather, the Yud combined with the Heh. There are a number of reasons why these two letters represent Wisdom and Understanding respectively. Yud has the primary form of a simple point. This alludes to the fact that Wisdom is simple and undifferentiated. The numerical value of Yud is I 0, indicating that all Ten Sefi rot are included in the simple nature of Wisdom. At the beginning of a word, the letter Yud indicates the mascu­line future. This is related to the teaching, \"Who is wise? He who perceives the future.\"37 At the end of a word, when used as a suffix, the letter Y ud means \"me\" or \"my.\" Wisdom is the essential nature of the individual, belonging to him alone. As such, it is the ultimate \"my.\" The same is true of the Sefirah of Wisdom (Chakhmah) with respect to the Infi­nite Being."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"16 SEFER YETZIRAH Heh has a numerical value of 5, alluding to the five fingers of the hand. As such. it represents Understanding, the hand that holds Wisdon. distributing and channeling it.38 At the beginning of a word, the prefix Heh means \"the.\" It is the definite article, that specifies and delineates an object. Like a hand, the definite article holds and specifies a concept that is specific rather than general. At the end of a word, Heh indicates the feminine pos­sessive, \"her.\" This is because Understanding is the domain of the Feminine Essence. Heh is one of the two letters in t he Hebrew alphabet that is writ­ten as two disjunct parts. This alludes to the fact that Understanding represents the beginning of separation. There is some disagreement in the Talmud as to whether or not Yah is a divine name.3Y The Sefer Yetzirah clearly takes the position that it is. Ya h. the Lord. .. In Hebrew. this is written as Y/1 YHVH (:11:1' :1'). It was with these six letters that God created all things. It is thus written, \"Trust in God for eternity of eternities. for with YH YHVH He formed uni­verses\" (Isaiah 26:4).411 Th e Lord of Hosts This name usually designates the Sefirot which are associated with revelation and prophecy. These are Netzach (Victory) and Hod (Splendor). 41 This name, however, also contains the Tetragrammaton (YHVH). here translated as \"the Lord. \" The Tetragrammaton desig­nates the totality of all the Sefirot. Hence, the phrase, \"YHVH of H osts.\" actually represents all the Scfirot as they arc revealed to man.42 This is the reason for the designation, \"YHVH of Hosts.\" It refers to revelation, the state in which God associates Himself with beings that arc lower than Himself, namely, His \"hosts.\" According to the Talmud, the first person to use the designation, \"Lord of Hosts,\" was Hannah, when she prayed, \"0 Lord of Hosts, if You will look at the affliction of Your servant\" (I Samuel I: I I ). 43"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"( ·hapter One 17 God qf'Jsrae/ This is connected to \" Lord of Hosts.\" While revelation in general is to all of God's hosts, in particular, it is granted to Israel. As we shall sec (2:4 ), the name I s rael is closely associated with the 231 gates. The Hebrew word for \"God\" here is Elohim. This alludes to Understanding, the concept that divides and delineates. The Living God The name is associated with the essential creative forces, repre­sented by the Sefirah of Yesod (Foundation). In man, this force paral­lels the sexual organ. In Hebrew. this phrase is Elohim Chaim. This Sefirah takes all the forces, collectively referred to as Elohim, and presents them in an active, procreative mode. L ife is defined as that which is active and procreates, and hence, this is the connotation of \"Living God.\"44 King of the Universe This is the mode in which God relates to the universe as a king, and it is associated with the Sefirah ofMalkhut (Kingship). Of all the Sefirot, this is the only one which comes into direct contact with the lower stages of creation. The first five designations, \"Yah, the Lord of Hosts, God of Israel, the Living God, King of the Universe,\" thus designate the Ten Sefirot in their downward mode, as they are the source of all creative force. El Shaddai These two names are usually translated as \"Almighty God.\" Saadia Gaon, however, translates them as \"Omnipotent Almighty.\" Here the Sefer Yetzirah begins designating the Sefirot in an upward mode. In the Bahir, the disciples thus ask, \"From above to below we know. But fr om below to above we do not know.\"45"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"18 SEFER YETZIRAH The designation El Shaddai is also related to the procreative force represented by Y csod (Foundation), and corresponding to the sexual organ in man. We therefore have two designations for Yesod (Foundation), '\" Living God\" (Elohim Chaim). and El S haddai. \"Living God\" is the designation of this Sefirah fr om a God's eye v iew. while El Shaddai is its designation fr om a man's eye view. God thus told Moses. \"I appeared to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob as E l Shaddai\" (Exodus 6:3). The first five designations represented the downward process, from God to the universe, through which the creative force is chan­neled. The author. however. is now designating the names that relate to the upward process. through which man approaches the Divine. \"King of the Universe, \" the lowest stage. applies to both directions. Merc�ful and Gracious These are the second and third of the Thirteen Attributes of Mercy. expressed in the verse, \" El, merciful and gracious\" (Exodus 34:6).40 On this level, one can comprehend the i nner workings of the six Sefirot. Chesed (Love), Gevurah ( Strength), Tiferet (Beauty), Netzach (Victory), and Hod (Splendor). It is through these Sefirot that God expresses His mercy to the world. This level was gained by Moses when God told him, \"I will have mercy upon whom I will have mercy. and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious\" (Exodus 33: 1 9). High and Exalted The next designations are all taken fr om the verse, \"For thus says [God], High and Exalted. dwelling in Eternity, and whose Name is Holy. I dwell lofty and holy ... \" (Isaiah 57:1 5). \"High and Exalted\" refers to the level of Understanding (Binah). The lower seven Sefirot correspond to the seven days of creation. Understanding (Binah) is above these seven Sefirot, and hence, it is the level preceding action and creation. This is the level where God is seen as being utterly transcendental, separated fr om all the worldly, and high above everything mundane. \"Dwelling in eternity\" speaks of the level of Wisdom (Chakhmah). This is the level that is above time. Here one perceives God as transcending not only space, but time as well."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Chapter One 19 ''His Name is Holy\" alludes to the level of the Crown (Keter), the highest of the Sefirot. The Kabbalists note that the expression, \"His Name,\" which in Hebrew is Sh 'mo (11::l�). has a numerical value (gematria) of 346. This is the same as the value of Ratzon (;rn), meaning \"will. \"47 Will is even higher than Wisdom, since it is the impluse that gives rise to all things, even thought. In Kabbalistic terms, Will is designated as Crown (Keter). Just as a crown is worn above the head, so is the Will above and outside all mental processes. The word Holy (Kadosh) denotes separation, and its general sense implies separation fr om the mundane.48 The expression, \"His Name is Holy,\" indicates that the C rown is a level that is separated and removed from every imaginable concept. Since it is above the mental processes, it cannot be grasped by them. The l ast expression, \"lofty and holy\" is not found in many ver­sions of Sefer Yetzirah. It possibly relates to the Infinite Being (Ain Sof), which is lofty above all concepts, even WilL The last five designations thus refer to the rungs which man must climb to reach the Infinite. These are the Sefirot in their upward mode. The impulse of creation first went downward through the Sefirot, and t hen it went upward again, returning to the Infinite. Only then could creation take place. With three books Sefer Yetzirah now begins to define the word Sefirah, t h e Hebrew designation for the divine eminations that form the basis of creation. The Hebrew word for book, Sepher (1.!lO), has the same root as the word Sephirah {:-t1•.!lo). except that the former is masculine and the latter is feminine. These three books are said to be \"text, number, and communica­tion.\" The Hebrew word for \"text\" here is Sepher (1.!lO), which literally means \"book.\" \"Number\" is Sephar (1.!lO), fr om which the English word \"cipher\" is derived. \"Communication\" is Sippur (11.!l•o), which more literally is \"telling. \" These three divisions respectively represent quality, quantity, and communication. These are the letters, numbers, and the manner in which they are used.49 These three books correspond to the three divisions of creation defined by Sefer Yetzirah, namely, \"Universe, Year, and Soul.\" In"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"20 SEFER YETZIRAH Tahle -1-. The three hooks.

See Table 4. As we shall see. the Sefer Yetzirah speaks of a five-dimensional continuum. defined by the Ten Sefirot. The first three are the three dimensions of space. the fourth dimension is time, while the fifth is the spiritual dimension. Since the three spacial dimensions comprise a single continuum, the three of them together constitute the first \"book.\" Time is the second \"book.\" while the spiritual dimension is the third. The three books define the three ways in which the array of the 32 paths can be presented. First, one can draw a diagram representing them, as one would picture them in a book. This is the aspect of \"text.\" This is also the aspect in which they appear in the Book of the Tora h, in the first chapter of Genesis. Secondly. one can express the numerical sequences and distribu­tions of these paths. Thus, for example, as the Sefer Yetzirah states (I :2). the 32 paths consist of ten Sefirot, and 22 letters, the latter which consists of three Mothers, seven Doubles, and twelve Elemen­tals. This is the aspect of number in the 32 paths. This is also related to their affinity to certain geometrical forms. Finally, one can speak of the relationships between these paths as they convey information. This is the level of \" communication.\" It is closely related to the 32 paths where they represent states of con­sciousness. as presented in Appendix II. These three aspects are most apparent in the letters of the alphabet.5° There are three primary ways in which the letters can be interpreted. First. there is the physical form of the letters, as they are written in a book. This is the aspect of \"text\" (Sepher), which literally means book. Secondly, there i s the numerical value or gematria o f the letter, this being \"number.\" Finally, there is the sound of the let­ter. as well as the way its name is pronounced, this being \"communication\" or \"telling.\" See Table 5 on page 22. \"Text\" (Sephcr), the physical form of the letter, pertains to the continuum of space. since form only can be defined in space. This is \"Universe.\" Number (Sephar), implies sequence, and this is the sequence of time. which is the continuum of the \"Year.\" Finally,"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Chaprcr One 21 communication (Sippur) applies to the mind, and this is in the spirit­ual continuum, which is \"Soul.\" These three words also define the term Sefirah. First, the word Sefirah shares the root with Sefer, meaning book. Like a book, each Sefirah can record information. The Sefirot thus serve as a memory bank in the domain of the Divine. A permanent record of everything that has ever taken place in all creation is thus made on the Sefirot. Secondly. the word Sefirah shares a root with Sephar, meaning number. It is the Sefirot that introduce an element of number and plurality into existence. The C reator, the Infinite Being, is the most absolute unity, and the concept of number does not apply to Him in any manner whatever. In speaking of the Infinite Being, the Sefer Yetzirah therefore asks, \"Before one, what do you count\" (1 :7)? It is only with the creation of the Sefirot that the concept of number comes into being. In this mode, every event and action is measured and weighed by the Sefirot, and the appropriate response is conceived and calcu­lated. Using the computer as an analogy, the Sefirot function as the processing unit of the Divine domain in this mode. Finally, the word Sefirah shares a root with Sippur, which means \"communication\" and \" telling.\" The Sefirot are the means through which God communicates with His creation. They are also the means through which man communicates with God. If not for the Sefirot, God. the Infinite Being, would be absolutely unknowable and unreachable. It is only through the Sefirot that he can be approached. Of course, as all the Kabbalists warn, one should not in any way worship the Sefirot or pray to them.51 One may, however, use them as a channel. Thus, for example, one would not think of directing a petition to the postman, but one could use him to deliver a message to the king. In a mystical sense, the Sefirot form a ladder or tree through which one can \"climb\" and approach the Infinite. Thus, when the Sefer Yetzirah presents the words Sepher, Sephar and Sippur here, it is not doing so accidentally. Rather, the book is deliberately presenting roots which define the concept of t he Sefirot. This is all the more obvious, since this entire chapter deals with the Sefirot. The three aspects, \"text, number and communication,\" are the keys to the methods of Sefer Yetzirah. If one wishes to influence anything in the physica l universe (space), he must make use of the physical shape of the letters.

The word Se.firah literally means \"counting.\" It is thus distin­guished from the word Mispar, meaning \" number.\" Although the Sefirot are said to represent the ten basic digits, they are not actual numbers. Rather, they are the sources from which the numbers origi­nate. Although the Sefer Y etzirah does not name the Ten Sefirot, their names are well known fr om the classical Kabbalah. They are given in Table 6. The Sefirot are usually presented in an array con­sisting of three columns, as in the figure. The names of the Sefirot are all derived fr om scripture. In recounting Betzalel's qualifications, God says, \"I h ave filled him with the spirit of God, with Wisdom, with Understanding, and with Knowledge\" (Exodus 31:3 ). As the Sefer Yetzirah later states (1 :9), the \"spirit of God\" refers to Keter (Crown), the first of the Sefirot. Wisdom and Understanding then refer to the next two Sefirot. The first two Sefirot are likewise alluded to in the verse, \"With Wisdom, God established the earth, and with Understanding, He established the heavens, and with His Knowledge, the depths were broken up\" (Proverbs 3: 19,20).

Similarly, the sixth is called Yesod (Foundation) rather than \"All.\" In older Kabbalistic texts, however, both designations are used. According to some Kabbalists, the Ten Sefirot also parallel the 10 Hebrew vouels.54 Together with the 22 letters, they then comprise the totality of the Hebrew language. Of Nothingness The Hebrew word here is Beli-mah (:1/J't,:J). This word can also be translated as meaning closed, abstract, absolute or ineffable. This word occurs only once in scripture, in the verse, \"He streches the north on Chaos, He hangs the earth on Nothingness (Be/i-mah)\" (Job 26:7). According to many commentaries, the word Beli-mah is derived fr om the two words, Be/i, meaning \"without,\" and Mah, meaning \"what\" or \"anything.\" The word Beli-mah would then mean \" without anything,\" or \"nothingness. \"55 According to this interpretion, the designat ion \"Sefirot of Noth­ingness\" is used to indicate that the Sefirot are purely ideal concepts, without any substance whatever. Unlike letters which have form and sound, the Sefirot have no intrinsic physical properties. As such, they are purely conceptual. Other sources state that Belimah comes fr om the root Balam (ct,:J), meaning \"to bridle.\" This is found in the verse, \"Do not be like a horse or mule, who do not understand, whose mouth must be bri­dled (balam) with bit and rein\" (Psalms 32:9).56 This second interpretation seems to be indicated by the Sefer Yetzirah itself, since it later says, \"Bridle (balom) your mouth fr om speaking of them\" (I :8). According to this, Belimah would be trans­lated as \"ineffable.\" The text is speaking of \"Ten Ineffable Sefirot,\" indicating that they cannot be described in any manner whatever."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"26 SEFER YETZIRAH Figure 2.

While the letters are primarily modes of expression, the Sefirot are inexpressibly by their very nature. A leading Kabbalist. Rabbi Issac of Acco ( 1250-1340), points out that Bclimah has a numerical value of 87. God's name Elohim, on the other hand. has a value of 86. Bc/imah thus represents the stage immediately following the pure essence of the Divine.5R 22 Foundation Letters In the simplest sense, these are called Foundation letters because it was through the letters of the Hebrew alphabet that the universe was created. 59The Sefer Y etzirah itself therefore says of the letters, \"with them He depicted all that was formed, and all that would ever be formed\" (2:2). This is also alluded to in what the Talmud says of the builder of the Tabernacle. \"Betzalel knew how to permute the let­ters with which heaven and earth were made.\" 60 With each act of creation. the Torah reports that \"God said.\" Thus. \"God said: let there be light.\" and \"God said, let there be a fi rmament.\" The decrees through which God brought creation into being consisted of sayings. These in turn consisted of words, and these words were formed out of letters. Hence, it was through the letters of the alphabet that the universe was created."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Chaprer One 27 These letters of creation were not only responsible for the incep­tion of the world, but they also constantly sustain it. It is thus written, \"Forever. 0 God, Your word stands in the heavens\" (Psalms 1 19:89). The very words and letters with which the universe was created are also the ones which constantly sustain it. If these words and letters were withdrawn for even an instant, the universe would cease to exist. 61 Thus. if one knows how to manipulate the letters correctly, one can also manipulate t he most elemental forces of creation. The meth­ods of doing this comprise the main subjects of Sefer Yetzirah. In Hebrew, \"Foundation Letters\" is Otiot Yesod. This can also be translated. \"Letters of Foundation.\" In the Kabbalah, Foundation (Yesod) is the Sefirah that corre­sponds to the sexual organ. It therefore h as the connotation of coup­ling and pairing, usually for the purpose of procreation. The letters are said to pertain to Foundation (Yesod), since it is only through the letters that Wisdom and Understanding can come together and be coupled. As discussed earlier, Wisdom is pure non­verbal thought. Understanding, on the other hand, can only be ver­baL since if an idea cannot be expressed verbally, it cannot be under­stood. The only link between nonverbal Wisdom, and verbal Understanding, consists of the letters of the alphabet. This is also evident fr om the above mentioned Talmudic teach­ing. The Talmud states that, \"Betzalel knew how to permute the let­ters with which heaven and earth were made.\" This is derived fr om the verse where God says of Betzalel, \"I will fi ll him with the spirit of God, with Wisdom, with Understanding, and with Knowledge\" (Exodus 31 :3). We therefore see that the ability to manipulate the letters of cre­ation depends on \"Wisdom, Understaning, and Knowledge.\" Knowl­edge (Daat), however, is the point at which Wisdom and Understand­ing come together. If has the connotation of joining and intercourse, as in the verse, \"Adam knew his wife Eve\" (Genesis 4: I ).62 Knowledge therefore serves in the place of Foundation between Wisdom and Understanding. It is in this same context that the Sefer Yetzirah speaks of \"Letters of Foundation.\" In a more general sense, the letters serve to pair off and connect all the Sefirot. This is particularly true in the \"Tree of Life\" shown in figure I (page 24), which shall be discussed in detail. Th ree Mothers These are the three letters, Alef (�). Mem (o), and Shin (w).

One reason why these letters are called \"Mothers\" is because, in general, the letters are derived from Understanding (Binah). As dis­cussed earlier, Understanding is the primary feminine principle, and is therefore called Mother. This is alluded to in the verse, \" For you shall call Understanding a Mother\" (Proverbs 2:3).64 Since these are the primary letters, they are called the \"Mothers.\"65 These letters are also called mothers (lmot) in the same sense that a crossroad is called a \"mother of the road\" (Ezekiel 21:26).66 These three letters are called \" crossroads,\" since they form th e hori­zontal links between the Sefirot in the Tree of Life diagram. On a more basic level, these are \"mothers,\" because the number of hori­zontal links d efines the order of the array, as discussed below.

Of these, three are horizontal, seven are vertical. and twelve are diagonal as shown in fi gure 2 on page 26. The division presented by Sefer Yetzirah is therefore a natural consequence of the array. This fi gure can actu­ally be looked upon as a member of a family of diagrams. The order of the diagram is then determined by the number of horizontal links. In practice, for reasons dealing with the basic nature of the Sefirot. they are not arranged in this natural order, but have the mid­dle line lowered somewhat. There are several different ways that the Kabbalists assign the letters in these diagrams. These are shown in figures 3-6. 1:3 Wr.Jn !1,:V::J�� iW:V i!lOr.J::J ;·m'S::J !1,i'!l0 itt':V nS'r.J::J :V�r.J�::J r,t:m i'n' !1'i::J, tt>r.Jn ilJ.:l :i1:Vr.J;, nS'r.J::J, r,wt,;, Ten Sefi\"l·ot of Nothingness in the number of ten fingers five opposite fi ve n·ith a singular covenant precisely in the middle in the circumcision of the tongue and in the circumcision of the membrum.

The \"masculine\" Sefirot on the right side would then be all those normally on the right, as well as the upper two center Sefirot. The \"feminine\" Sefirot on the left would include the three normally on the left, together with the lower two center SefirotY The five masculine Sefirot are often referred to as the five Loves ( Chasadim), since they are on the side of Chesed (Love). The five feminine Sefirot are similarly called the five Strengths (Gevurot) because they are on the side of Gevurah (Strength). See figure 7 on page 3 4. When the Sefirot are in their normal state, arrayed in three col­umns, they are in a state of equilibrium. But when the Sefirot of the central column are moved to the right and left, so as to divide the Sefirot into two arrays, a powerful tension is produced. When they are in such a mode, poweful spiritual forces can be directed and channeled. Therefore, in many places where God interferes directly with the physical world, the scripture speaks of God's fingers or hands. The most obvious case occurs with reference to creation itself, which the Psalmist calls \"the work of Your fingers,\" as quoted above. We simi­larly find, \"My [left] hand has founded the earth, and My right hand has spread out the heavens\" (Isaiah 48: 1 3). Before such a creative act could take place, all the Sefirot had to be polarized to male and female sides, generating tension and force. Just as human procreation involves male and female, so does Divine creation. Very closely related to this are the various actions that use the hands to channel spiritual forces. These include the laying of hands, the lifting of the hands in the Priestly Blessing, and the spreading of the hands in prayer. In all these cases, t he intent is to channel the power of the Ten Sefirot through the ten fingers.68 In making them correspond to the two hands, the Sefirot are polarized, creating spirit­ual tension. See figure 8 on page 3 4. Once such tension exists, through meditation and concentration, the powers of the Sefirot can be focused and channeled.

The paradigm of a covenant is that which God made with Abraham when he commanded him, \"Take to Me a prime heifer, a prime female goat, a prime ram, a turtle dove, and a young pigeon\" (Gene­sis 15:9).711 These fi ve animals paralleled the fi ve fingers. Three of the animals were divided in half, so that the six halves represented the six Sefirot that are normally to the right and left. The four halves of the birds, which were not divided, represented the four Sefirot which are normally in the center line. See fi gure 9.

It was for this reason that they were given as two tablets, rather than as a single one. When t he Ten Sefirot are divided into this double array, the place in the middle becomes the focus of spiritual tension. This palce is then called the \"singular covenant\" or \" unifying covenant.\" Circumcision of the To ngue The Hebrew word for \"circumcision\" is Milah. This same word, however, also means \"word,\" as we find, \"God's spirit speaks in me, and His word (milah) is on my tongue\" (2 Samuel 23:2). Hence this can also be translated, \"a word of the tongue.\" The \"circumcision of the tongue\" refers to the ability to utilize the mysteries of the Hebrew language. 7 1 It also refers to the ability to probe the mysteries of the Torah.72 In a more general sense, such circumcision denotes a fluency of speech. One who cannot speak properly is said to have \"uncircumcised lips.\" Moses thus said, \"How will Pharoah listen to me, when I have uncircumcised lips?\" (Exodus 6: 12). When one is given the power of proper speech, his tongue is said to be circum­cised. This is both the \"circumcision\" and the \"word \" of the tongue. A good example of this is found in the Priestly Blessing. Here, the priests raise their hands and pronounce the blessing outlined in"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"36 SEFER YETZIRAH scripture (Numbers 6:22-27). The priests must raise their hands so that they are precisely level with the mouth, as it is written, \"Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and he blessed them\" (Leviti­cus 9:22). 71 The cohen-priest must concentrate on the fact that his ten fingers represent the Ten Sefirot. As a result of the focus of spirit­ual force between his two hands, his tongue is \"circumcised,\" and his blessing has its proper effect. The same is true of raising one's hands in prayer. Here again, the two hands focus spritual power so as to \"circumcise\" the tongue, allowing the individual to pray effectively. In some Kabbalistic medi­tative systems, the raised hand position was likewise used to focus spiritual energy. 74 It was for a very similar reason that the cohen­priests had to wash their hands and feet before engaging in the divine service. 75 This also provides insight into the significance of the two Cheru­bim that were on the Ark of the Covenant in the Holy of Holies. These two Cherubim were the source of all prophecy. Prophecy involves a particularly intense focusing of spiritual energy, allowing the prophet to actually speak in God's name. Prophecy was thus the ultimate level of \"circumcision of the tongue.\" In describing the Ark, God told Moses, \"I will commu ne with you. and I will speak to you fr om above the ark-cover, fr om between the two Cherubim, which are on the Ark of Testimony\" (Exodus 25:22). 76 What was true of Moses was also true of the other prophets, and the influx of prophecy was channeled primarily through these two Cherubs in the Holy of Holies. There is some evidence that at least in some cases, the prophetic experience was the result of intense meditation of these two Cherubim. 77 When the Cherubim were removed fr om the Holy of Holies with the destruction of the First Temple, prophecy as such ceased to exist. According to the Zohar, the two Cherubim represented the Sefirot d ivided into a masculine and feminine array. 7 9 These were placed on the Ark, which contained the original Tablets of the Ten Commandments. There were five Commandments of each tablet, so the two represented a similar array of the Sefirot. This created a per­manent state of tension, through which the spiritual force associated with prophecy could be focused. Circumcision of the Membrum Just as the fingers of the two hands represent the Ten Sefirot, so do t he toes of the two fe et. Between the legs is the circumcision o f the sexual organ."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Chapter One 37 In order to understand t he significance of this circumcision, one must realize why God commanded that it be done on the e ighth day. The Torah states. \"On the eighth day, the flesh of his foreskin must be circumcised\" (Leviticus 12:3). 80 The covenant of circumcision was originally given to Abraham. The world was created in six days, representing the six primary directions that exist in a three-dimensional universe. The seventh day, the Sabbath, is the perfection of the physical world, and i t repre­sents the focal point of these six directions, as discussed below ( 4:4). The eighth day then represents a step above the physical, into the realm of the transcendental. HI Through the covenant of circumcision, God gave Abraham and his desendents power over the transcendental plane. The most obvi­ous case in which this occurs is in conception, where a soul is brought down into the world. Since the mark of the covenant is on the sexual organ, it gives the individual access to the highest spiritual realms, from which he can draw down the most lofty souls. By meditating on the fact that the ten toes represent the Ten Sefirot. one is able to concentrate spiritual energy into the sexual organ. 82 Through such methods, one can gain complete control over one's sexual activities, even in the midst of intercourse.83 By sanctifying oneself in this manner during sexual intercourse, one is able to determine the qualities of the child that will be conceived.s4 The covenant of circumcision also represents the channeling of sexual energy. The sexual drive is one of the most poweful psycholog­ical forces in man, and when it is channeled along spiritual lines, it can help bring one to the highest mystical states. In giving the com­mandment of circumcision, God indicated that the emotions and desires associated with sex could be used for the mystical quest of the Divine on a transcendental plane. The juxtaposition between the \" circumcision of the tongue\" and the \"circumcision of the membrum\" explains the prophetic position favored by Elijah. The scripture states, \"Elijah went up to the top of the Carmel, entranced himself on the ground, and placed his face between his knees\" (I Kings 18:42). This position was used for the intense concentration of spiritual energy. Accord ing to the Midrash, this position was used because it placed the head in conjunction with the mark of circ umcision.85 When one is in this position, all of these forces are brought together. The ten fingers, ten toes, tongue and sexual organ comprise a total of 22 elements, paralleling the 22 letters of the Hebrew alpha­bet. 86 The individual's body itself thus becomes an alphabet, with which he can \"write\" in the spiritual realm."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"38 SEFER YETZIRAH 1:4 ��1 1t7:V :Vt7 n ��1 1t7:V ;-trJ'�::J !111'�0 1t7:V j1n::J ;-tJ'::J::J o:Jm ;-trJ:Jn::J p;, ;-t1t7:V nn� 1:J'1' ::Jt7;'11 1'11:::1 �:v 1:::11 1rJ:l);\"l1 tJ;-trJ 11j?;'11 tJ;-t::J :1J1:JrJ �:v 7i:>n Sefirot of Nothingness ten and not nine ten and not ele1·en Understand with 11'isdom Be wise with Understanding Examine with them and prohe from them ,Hake feachj thing stand on its essence And make the Creator sit on His base. This section speaks primarily of the first three Sefirot, Keter (Crown), Chakhmah (Wisdom), and Binah (Understanding). Later, we find a similar discussion with regard to the lower seven Sefirot ( 4:5). Te n and not nine The highest faculty in man is will. This corresponds to the first of the Sefirot, Keter (Crown). If one were to attempt to describe God, it would be tempting to say that He is pure Will. This would be very much like saying that God is \" spirit,\" or that He is \" love.\" since all such descriptions attempt to depict God in term s of human traits. If any human trait were to be used, however, it should be will since this is the highest of all human faculties. If we would say that God was pure Will, however, then we would be saying that He is identical with Keter. Keter, however, is merely a Sefirah, and as such, it is something created by God and inferior to Him. We therefore cannot even say that God in pure Will. Even Will is among His creations, and is inferior to Him. Therefore, there is no word that can be used to describe God's essence. The author consequently states that the Sefirot are \"ten and not nine.\" For if we were to say that God is Will, then Keter would be identical to God, and only nine Sefirot would remain. But since there"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"( 'haptcr One 39 are ten Sefirot, then even Will is nothing more than a Sefirah, and it is something that is inferior to the Creator. The Sefer Y etzirah also warns, \"ten and not eleven.\" This is to teach that God Himself, the Infinite Being, is not to be included among the Sefirot. If He were, then there would be eleven rather than ten. x7 God belongs to a totally different category than the Sefirot, and is not to be counted among them. As a result, we cannot even describe Him by such purely abstract qualities as will, wisdom, love o r strengt h. When the Bible makes use of any of these qualities in relation to God, it is speaking of the Sefirot created by God, and not of the Creator Himself. This is particularly important for the mystic. As a person reaches the highest levels, he might think that he is actually reaching God Himself. The Sefer Yetzirah therefore warns that when one climbs the ladder of the Sefirot, there are only ten steps, and not eleven. The Creator is always beyond our grasp. It is for this reason that God i s called Ain Sof, literally \"the Infi­nite.\" One can climb higher and higher, reaching toward infinity, but one can never attain it. Infinity may remain a goal, but it is only a goal that points to a direction, but not a goal that acually can be reached. The same is true of the Infinite Ain Sof.88 Understand with Wisdom As discussed earlier, Understanding (Binah) involves verbal thought, while Wisdom (Chakhmah) is pure nonverbal thought. Understanding consists of the normal reverie, where the person thinks out things so as to understand and organize the thoughts. Wisdom, on the other hand, is pure thought, and in particular, it refers to a state of consciousness where the mind is not engaged in reverie. It is very difficult to experience pure, nonverbal thought. As soon as a person attempts to clear his mind of thought, he immediately begins to think, \"Now I am not thinking of anything.\" The state of Wisdom or Chakhmah consciousness is one of pure nonverbal thought, which is very difficult to attain. I t is in an attempt to attain the state of Chakhmah consciousness that the various meditative methods are used. Thus, mantra medita­tion attempts to clear the mind of reverie by filling it with the repeated words of the mantra. Similarly, contemplation pursues the same goal by filling the mind with the contemplated object. Wisdom is associated with the nonverbal right hemisphere of the brain, while Understanding i s associated with the verbal left hemi­sphere. As the Kabbalists explain, Wisd om is normally only experi-"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"40 SEFER YETZIRAH enced when it is clothed in Understanding. One may be able to expe­rience the workings of the nonverbal areas of the mind, but only when one clothes them with verbal thoughts. It is here that the Sefer Yetzirah begins instruction on how to grasp the Sefirot. 89 The first step is to, \"Understand with Wisdom, and to be wise with Understanding.\" This involves a deliberate oscillation between Understanding and Wisdom, between verbal Binah consciousness, and nonverbal Chakhmah consciousness. Try for a moment to stop thinking. You remain completely con­scious. but there are no verbal thoughts in your mind. If you are an average person. you may be able to maintain such a state for a few seconds. but immediately your mind begins to verbalize the experi­ence. You might say to youself. \"I am not thinking of anything.\" But as soon as you do this. of course, you actually are thinking of something. For those fe w seconds, however, you have experienced nonverbal Chakhmah consciousness. If you work at this exercise, you can gradu­ally learn how to extend the time in which you are in this state. It is like a heavy pendulum. the longer you push it back and forth, the furt her it will swing. Similarly, the more you learn to oscillate between verbal Binah consciousness and nonverbal Chakhmah con­sciousness. the deeper you will reach into the latter, and the longer you will be able to maintain this state. Chakhmah consciousness is particularly important in reaching the Sefirot. As mentioned earl ier (I :2). the Sefirot are ineffable, and cannot be understood verbally. As the Sefer Yetzirah itself says, they must be reached by \" paths of Wisdom,\" that is, through the paths of nonverbal Chakhmah consciousness. Examine with them A similar expression is later used with regard to the lower Sefirot ( 4:5). Once an individual is able to experience the Sefirot, he must make use of them to examine and test them. The author does not say \"examine them.\" but \"examine with them.\" The Hebrew word used here is Eachan. and it means that one is to test things for their intrin­sic quality as they are at the immediate moment.90 When a person has an awarenes of the Sefirot, he can then \"examine\" anything in creation and determine the Sefira h to which it pertains. As he becomes proficient in doing this. he can use various"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Chapter One 41 things to strengthen his attachment to their associated Sefirah. When the Sefer Yetzirah was first written, each individual had to do this on his own. Now, however, there are many lists which associate vari­ous things and ideas with their appropriate Sefirot, and t hese can be used as aides in binding oneself to them. 9 1 Probe from them The Hebrew word for \"probe\" here is Chakar, which usually indicates attaining the ultimate knowledge of a thing. 92 The Sefer Yetzirah says that one should \" probe fr om them.\" As a result of the spiritual power that one attains from the Sefirot, one should probe each thing to its ultimate depth. Through one's experi­ence of the Sefirot, one is to gain the deepest possible insight into everything in the world. Note carefully that the Sefer Yetzirah does not tell us to contem­plate the Sefirot themselves. Rather, it instructs us to use them in developing an inner sight with which to view the world.93 Make [each] thing stand on its essence In this manner, one can learn how to perceive the essential nature of each thing. 94 T he Sefer Yetzirah says, \"make each thing stand on its essence\" so as to parallel the next phrase, \" make the Cre­ator sit on His base.\" The Sefer Yetzirah is also indicating here that when a person per­ceives the true spiritual nature of a thing, he also elevates that thing spiritually. \"Standing\" refers to such elevation. The expression, \"make each thing stand\" therefore says that when one \"probes fr om them,\" he elevates the things that he probes. Make the Creator sit on His Base The Hebrew word for \"base\" here is Makhon, and in a number of places it is seen as the place where God \"sits.\" Thus, in his prayer, Solomon speaks of \"the heaven. the base (makhon) of Your sitting\" (I Kings 8:39). The scripture likewise states, \"Righteousness and"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"42 SEFER YETZIRAH Tahk 7. The four universes. Universe Content Level Atzilut (Nearness.

In other places, t he Bible speaks of the Temple as being the \"base\" upon which God sits.9s The word Makhon (J1:nJ) comes fr om the root Kon (p::�), which is also the root of the word Hekhin (l'Xl), meaning \"to prepare.\"96 Hence, Makhon refers not merely to a physical base. but to one that is specifically prepared for a special purpose. The Scripture thus says, \"He founded the earth on its base (makhon)\" (Psalms I 04:5). This verse indicates that every thing in the physical world has a specific spiritual counterpart and basis, through which it can be elevated .97 In generaL the anthropomorphism \"sit,\" when used with respect to God, indicates a sense of lowering. 98 When a person sits down, he lowers his body. Similarly, when God \"sits,\" He \"lowers\" His essence so as to be concerned with His creation. When the Bible speaks of God's Throne, it is speaking of t he vehicle through which He expresses such concern. In Kabbalah, there is general rule that every \"awakening fr om below\" motivates an \"awakening from above.\" Thus, when a person mentally elevates each thing to its spiritual essence, he also brings spiritual sustenance (shefa ) down to that particular object. This suste­nance can then be channeled and used by the individual. Under some conditions, this can be used to actually bring about physical changes in the world.99 T he term Makhon is also interpreted by the Talmud to indicate a parallelism between the spiritual and the physical domains.1 00 The \"prepared basis\" (makhon) through which God \" sits\" and channels His spiritual influence to t he world is precisely this Makhon-the paral lelism between the spiritual and the physical. This is the aspect through which God \"sits.\" and the scripture therefore speaks as the \"base (makhon) of Your sitting.\""},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Chap/cr One 43 In this context. the Sefer Yetzirah here calls God the Yo tzer. We have translated this as \" the Creator,\" but a more accurate rendition would be \"the Former.\" or the \"One who forms.\" In Hebrew, there are three words which have similar meaning. They arc Bara. meaning \"to create,\" Yatzar, meaning \"to form,\" and Asah, meaning \"to make.\" According to the Kabbalists, Bara indi­cates creation ex nehilo, \"something fr om nothing.\" Ya tzar denotes formation of something fr om a substance that already exists, \"something fr om something.\" Asah has the connotation of the com­pletion of an action.'o' The Kabbalists teach that stages parallel the three supernal uni­verses. which are called Beriyah (Creation), Yetzirah (Formation), and Asiyah (Making). They are alluded to in the verse, \"All that is called in My Name, for My Glory (Atzilut), I have created it (Beriyah), I have formed i t (Yetzirah), and I have made it (Asiyah)\" (Isaiah 43:7).102 The highest universe is Atzilut, the domain of the Sefirot them­selves. Below this is Beriyah, the domain of the Throne. Since Bcriyah (Creation) is \"something fr om nothing,\" Atzilut is often referred to as \"Nothingness\" (Ayin). Hence, the Sefirot, which are in Atzilut, are called Sefirot of Nothingness. Below Beriyah is the universe of Yetzirah (Formation), which is the world of the angels. Finally, there is the universe of Asiyah (Mak­ing), which consists of the physical world and its spiritual shadow. See Table 7. Here, Sefer Yetzirah is speaking primarily about establishing a link between the two lower worlds, Yetzirah and Asiyah. The meth­ods of Sefer Yetzirah involve the manipulation of the forces of the Universe of Asiyah, and t his is the reason for the name of the book. The t ext therefore speaks of God as the Yo tzer, the Former, indicating His manifestation in the world of Yetzirah. From the above mentioned verse, \"He founded (yasad) the earth on its base (Makhon),\" we see that Makhon refers to a spiritual level that is close to the physical world, namely, the lowest level of Yetzirah.103 Makhon is on the level corresponding to Yesod (Founda­tion), which has the connotation of connecting and binding. Hence, it binds Yetzirah to Asiyah. By elevating objects in the physical world, one can then draw upon the forces of Yetzirah, the world of the angels. It is for this reason that the Sefer Yetzirah uses the term Makhon (Base) rather than Throne (Kisey). The term \"Throne\" would indicate the Universe of Beriyah, which is the world of the Throne. Makhon, on the other hand, is a level of Yetzirah."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"44 SEFER YETZIRAH 1:5 �10 o;,t, j'�iO 1iOV j!11!J :1!J't,:J !111'.!JO 1iOV j?01V1 :J1tl j?01V !1' 1n� j?!J1V1 !1'i0�1 j?!J1V :nvo j?01V, n1m j?01V nnn j?01V, c,, j?01V :v, jr.J�:J lt,O t,� 1'n' j,1� t:J,,, j?01:V, j,.!JY j?01V :1V '1V 1V ,i01j? i1V!J!J ct,1:J:J t,w,!J 1cn Se.f/rot o( Nothingness: Their measure is ten which have no end A depth of beginning A depth of end A depth ofgood .-I depth o( evil A depth of ahore .4 depth of below A depth of east A depth of west A depth o( north A depth of south The singular Master Godfaithful King dominates mer them all from His h oly dwelling until eternity ()(eternities.

See Table 8 on page 46. The space continuum consists of three dimensions, up-down, north-south, and east-west. This continuum is defined by six direc­tions, and is called \"Universe.\" The time continuum consists of two directions, past and future, or beginning and end. This is called \"year.\" Finally, there is a moral, spiritual fift h dimension, whose two directions a re good and evil. This is called \"soul.\" According to the later Kabbalists, these ten directions parallel the Ten Sefirot in the following manner: Beginning End Chakhmah (Wisdom) Binah (Understanding)"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"ChapTer One 45 Good Keter (Crown) Evil Malkhut (Kingship) Up Netzach (Victory) Down Hod (Splendor) North Gevurah (Strength) South Chesed (Love) East Tiferet (Beauty) West Yesod (Foundation)104 The Ten Sefi rot are thus seen as consisting of fi ve sets of opposites. These are the \" five opposite five\" discussed above (1:3 ). The oppo­sites parallel the five fingers on each of the two hands.1 05 Wisdom is always defined as the beginning by the Kabbalists. This is based on such verses as \"The beginning is Wisdom\" (Proverbs 4:7).106 This corresponds to the beginning of existence, before cre­ation was defined, articulated, or verbalized. God then created the world with ten sayings. This represents the power of Understanding (Binah), which is the aspect of verbal thought. As discussed earlier, the name Elohim, used in the account of creation. represents Understanding. \"Sayings\" can only come about through Understanding. denoted by the n ame Elohim. Psychologically, Wisdom also represents the past in another manner. Memory is not verbal, but is stored in the mind in a nonver­bal mode. It is only when one brings a memory to the surface that it becomes verbalized. Since pure memory is completely nonverbal, it is in the category of Wisdom. The future, on the other hand, cannot be imagined at all, except in verbal terms. One can remember the past, but not the future. The future can only be conceived when it is described. The main way in which we know the future is by extrapulating fr om our knowledge of the past, or, in the language of the Talmud, \"Understanding one thing from another. \"107 Past and future are also the counterparts of Wisdom and Under­standing insofar that they are respectively male and female. The past is said to be male, since it directly influences the future. In this man­ner, it is as if the feminine future is impregnated by the past. Keter is said to be \"good,\" since it is the Sefirah closest to God. For the same reason, Malkhut, the Sefirah furthest from God, is sai d to be evil.

The entire array of the Sefirot is often called the \"Tree of Life.\" The center line. from Keter to Malkhut, when taken alone, is called the \"Tree of Knowledge.\" It is on this line that good and evil come together, this being the mystery of the \"Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil\" (Genesis 2:9), of which Adam and Eve were commanded not to partake.108 It is in the quasi-Sefirah of Knowledge (Daat) that good and evil converge. Because of this, some of the later Kabbalists place the \"depth of good and depth of evil\" both in Knowledge ( Daat).lo9 There are 32 hyperquadrants that can be defined in a five­dimensional hyperspace. These correspond to the 32 apexes on a five­dimensional hypercube, as discussed above (I: I). These in turn are related to the 32 paths of Wisdom. See Table 9. In general, a knife or cutting blade has one dimension less than the continuum that it cuts. In our three-dimensional continuum, a blade is essentially a two-dimensional plane. T herefore, in a five­dimensional continuum, one would expect a blade to have four dimensions. Such a blade would be a four-dimensional hypercube, having I 6 apexes.

Each of these directions is said to be infinite and endless. Indeed, in saying that \"they have no end,\" the Sefcr Yetzira h uses the term, \".·lin (!a-hem) Sof\" This is the term usually used for God, the Infinite Being. Each direction extends without limit, and in this respect, the Sefirot share a property with the Infinite Being.111 The initiate is here given an allegory through which he or she can perceive his or her path to the Infinite Being. The allegory con­sists of any of the directions. Thus, for example, \"up\" has no end. One can continue to travel in an upward direction, but can never actually reach \"up.\" The same is true when one travels \" up\" spiritually. A depth o.( beginning The Sefcr Y ctzirah does not speak of directions, but of depths. In general. the concept of depth indicates something at a great dis­tance, as when one looks down a deep well. gazing at its \"depth.\" It therefore denotes great distance. both physical and mental. There­fore. an idea that is difficult to understand, and far fr om one's com­prehension, is also said to be deep. There are many examples of this in scripture. We thus find, \" The heavens for height, the earth for depth, and the heart of kings has no probing\" (Proverbs 25:3). Regarding Wisdom, Kohelet likewise said, '\"It is deep, deep, who can fi nd it\" (Ecclesiastes 7:24). In particular, the word \"depth\" is used in relation to the Divine, as in, \"How great are your works. 0 God, Your thoughts are very deep\" (Psalms 92:6). These ten depths therefore represent the ten directions extended to infinity. It is written. \"Counsel in man's heart is like deep water, but a man of understanding will draw it out\" (Proverbs 20:5). Although the depth of these directions is infinite, it can be described mentally. The first technique involves verbal thought, through being \"a man of Understanding. \" Gradually, then, one can also learn to depict these infinite depths nonverbally. The fi rst exercise is to try to depict the \" depth of beginning.\" Attempt to picture an infinity of time in the past. Let the mind travel back to a minute ago. and hour ago, a day ago, a year ago, continuing until you reach a level where you are trying to imagine an infinity ago. Then do the same with regard to the future."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Chapter One 49 The next exercise involves trying to imagine infinite good and infinite evil. The limits are pure ideas, which cannot be verbalized. Finally, one must imagine the limits of the spacial dimensions. One must perceive the height of the sky and beyond the sky, the depth of the earth and beyond the earth.11 :> In this manner, one gradually trains the mind to depict the infi­nite. Since the Scfirot themselves are also infinite, this exercise can help one attain communion with the Sefirot.113 The individual can then learn how to climb the Tree of the Sefirot, and eventually approach the loftiest spiritual heights. This is accomplished through these depths. It is written, \"A song of steps, fr om the depths I call You 0 God\" (Psalms 130: I). One calls out to God by meditating on the depths, and then one can ascend through a series of steps. The psalm is therefore called \"a song of steps.\" 114 Th e singular Master This can also be read, \"The Master is singular,\" and a similar expression is found below ( I :7). After describing the five dimensional continuum defined by the Sefirot, the Sefer Yetzirah specifically refers to God as the \" singular Master.\" The Hebrew for \"singular\" here is Yachid, indicating a com­plete and absolute unity. The unity of God is absolute. He is not like a person who consists of many parts. He is not even like the most simple physical object, since even such an object has three dimensions. To say that God is bound by dimensions would in itself introduce an element of plural­ity in His essence, and this is excluded. After the Sefer Yetzirah has defined the five-dimensional contin­uum, one might be misled to think that God Himself is a five­dimensional being. The text therefore stresses His unity at this point. The concept of dimensionality does not apply to God at all. God fa ithful King In Hebrew, this is El Melekh Ne'eman (lr.lll.:) 1�r.l ���.:). The ini t ial letters of this phrase spell out Amen (lr.lll.:), and according to the Tal­mud, it is this phrase that defines the word Amen.115 The statement here that God is \"faithful\" means that He i s acces­sible only through faith. The human intellect can only grasp concepts"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"50 SEFER YETZIRAH within the five-dimensional continuum of space-time-spirit. God, the Infinite Being. however, is beyond this. He may relate to the universe as \" Ki ng.\" but He Himself is above the grasp of our mentality. Dominates them all The Hebrew word for \"dominate\" here is Moshel. There are two synonyms that indicate dominance-Melekh and Moshel. A Melekh is a king who interacts with his subjects, and is therefore affected by them. A Jfoshe/. on the other hand, is a tyrant and dictator, who rules. but is in no way influenced by his subordinates. 116 God is sometimes called a Melekh, but this refers only to His actions through Malkhut (Kingship), the lowest of the Sefirot. The Infinite Being. however, is actually a Moshel, an absolute ruler who is in no way affected by His creation. The scripture thus says, \"If you arc righteous, what do you give Him? What does He receive fr om your hand\" (Job 35:7) .117 This is particularly true of God's relationship to the Sefirot. He is in no way affected or defined by them. From His holy habitation The Hebrew word for \"habitation\" here is Ma 'on (11Vr.l). The expression \"Holy habitation\" (Ma 'o n Kadosh) occurs a number of times in the Bible.11� It is also used again below (I: 12). The word .\\fa 'on is defined by the verse, \"0 God, You have been a habitation (Ina 'on) for us\" (Psalms 90: I). The Midrash interprets this to indicate that \"God is the habitation of the world, and the world is not His habitation.\" 11 q God is the \"place\" of the world, defin­i ng the space-time-spirit continuum, and He is not defined by any continuum whatever. The continuum is contained in God, as it were, and He is not contained in the continuum. The word Ma 'on is very closely related to the word Makom (C1j?r.l), meaning ''place.\" .\\1akom comes fr om the root Kom (c1p), meaning \" to stand.\" Hence, Jfakom denotes a place in physical space. where something can \"stand.\" Ma 'o n (11Vr.l), on the other hand, comes from the same root as Onah (T1J1J,/), meaning a \"time\" or \"period.\" Just as Makom defines a point in space, so i\\1a'on defines a point in the space-time continuum.1211 Thus. when the Sefcr Yetzirah says that God dominates the Sefirot fr om His \"Holy Ma 'on\" it is indicating that He is the \"place\" and \"habitation\" of the five-dimensional continuum. Not only does"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"C 'hap!er One 51 God circumscribe the universe of space, but He even defines time and spirit. This is said to be \"holy,\" and as discussed above ( 1:1 ), the word \"holy\" (Kadosh) denotes separation fr om the mundane. The Infinite Being is separated fr om all the Sefirot, and in relation to Him, even the Sefirot are mundane. Until eternity of eternities In Hebrew, this is Adey Ad (1V '1:V), and this expression occurs numerous times in the Bible.121 There arc two synonyms which denote eternity. The first is LeO/am, usually translated as \"forever,\" which indicates the end point of the time continuum. Often used is the expre ssion LeO/am Va Ed (1V1 o?1:v?), which means \"forever and eternity.\" The expression \"etern ity,\" here denotes the realm outside the time continuum, where the concept of time does not exist at all. Even in such a timeless domain, however, there is still a kind of hypertime, where events can occur in a logical sequence. The Mid­rash calls such hypertime, the \"order of time\" (seder zemanim).122 The expression \"etern ity of eternities\" (Adey Ad) denotes a domain that is beyond even such hypertime. 1:6 j?T:J:1 :1�1'-J.::l j n\"E:lY :1l.J ' t,::l n11'E:l0 1WV :J1W1 �1Y1:J j:1:1 11:::111 fj? o;,t, j'� jn't,::ln1 :t:J'mnwr.J o;, 1�o::l 'JE:lt,1 1E:l111' :1E:l10::l 11l.J�l.Jt,1 Ten Sefirot of Nothingness Their vision is like the \"appearance of lightning\" Their limit has no end And His Wo rd in them is \"running and returning\" They rush to His saying like a whirlwind And befo re His throne they prostrate themselves. Their vision The word for \"vision\" here is Tz a(iyah, which usually denotes a prophetical or mystical vision. The Hekhalot, an ancient mystical text which might be contemporary to Scfcr Yetzirah, speaks of the \"vision (l�a(l,vah) of the Markava.\"123 The Markava is the divine"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"52 SEFER YETZIRAH Chariot seen in Ezekiel's vision. and the term is used to denote the mystical experience on its highest levels. The Sefer Yetzirah is now describing how the Sefirot appear in a mystical vision. In earlier sections, the text spoke of the exer­cises used to visualize the Sefirot. and now it describes their appearance. The Bahir. another very ancient text, explains that the word T:::. a(iyah. derived fr om the root T:::. afah, indicates that one is looking down fr om a high place.124 In the previous section, the Sefer Yetzirah spoke of the Sefirot as ten \" depths.\" When one looks into a depth, however, one is usually looking downward. In the Hekhalot, the mys­tical experience is often described as a descent in a downward direc­tion, and it is called \"descending to the Markava. \"125 One reason why gazing at the Sefirot is called a \"descent\" is because. in order to accomplish this, one must first attain Chakhmah consciousness. as discussed earlier. In the array of the Sefirot, how­ever. Chakhmah is the highest, at least of those which are approacha­ble. In climbing the Tree of the 32 paths of Wisdom, one must begin by attaching himself to Chakhmah (Wisdom). When this is accom­plished, one then looks down at the other Sefirot. Only then does one begin climbing the Sefirot, beginning at the lowest. Like the appearance of lightning This is taken fr om the verse, \"And the Chayot, running and returning. like the appearance oflightning (ba:::.ak)\" (Ezekiell:l 4). The word Ba:::.ak. which is found only in this one place in the Bible. is usually translated as '' lightning\" or \"a spark.\"126 According to other interpretations, Ba:::ak denotes a flashing meteor or a burst­ing bubble.127 According to all these opinions, the Sefer Yetzirah is stating that the Sefirot can only be visualized for an instant, and then they vanish. The great Kabbalist, Rabbi Moshe de Leon (1238- 1305), best known as the publisher of the Zohar, offers an interesting analogy.128 When the Sefirot are seen in a mystical vision, their appearance is like sunlight reflected on a wall fr om a bowl of water. As long as the bowl is absolutely stilL the reflected image is clear, but t he slightest vibration causes it to break up and oscillate wildly. Similarly. a clear vision of the Sefirot would be possible in the­ory. but only if the mind were absolutely still and calm. The slightest exterior thought, however. destroys the image completely. When the mind is in a state where it can visualize the Sefirot, it is disturbed by the most minute distractions."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"C 'haprer One 53 Their limit has no end This is obviously derived fr om the verse, \"For every limit I have seen an end, Your commandment is very broad\" (Psalms 119 : 96), The Hebrew word for \"limit\" here is Takhlit (r1'�J.n), which also means \"completion\" and \"ultimate.\"12Y It is derived fr om the root Kalah (;\"l�::J), meaning to \"complete\" or \"finish,\" as in \"the heaven and earth were finished (kalah)\" (Genesis 2: I). The word Ta khlit also denotes purpose, since when something fulfills its purpose it is said to be completed and fulfilled. The expression, \"their limit has no end (ketz),\" can be compared to the earlier expression, \"their measure ... has no end (sof)\" (I :5). Both words, Ketz and 5()/: denote an end, but the shade of meaning is somewhat different. The word 5()((�1'0) is derived fr om the root Safa h (;\"l!l'O), meaning \"to cease to exist.\" The term Ketz ('f\"j?), on the other hand, comes from Katzat:: ('f\"Yj?), meaning \"to cut off.\"130 Hence, the end implied by Sof is where something ceases to exist, while Ketz implies the point where it is \"cut off\" that is, its extreme boundary or limit. As one authority puts it. So( is the end in relation to that which follows it, and Ketz is the end with regard to that which precedes it.131 When the Sefer Y etzirah spoke earlier of the Sefirot as exten­sions, the text says that they have no Sof This indicates that there is no place where they cease to exist, no matter how far out one goes. This is the infinity of extension. Similarly, when God is called Ain Sof, literally \"without S()t:'' it also means that there is no place where He ceases to exist.132 Here. on the other hand, the Sefer Yetzirah is speaking of the Sefirot as they are seen in a mystical vision. The text then says that their purpose, completion and outcome have no limit (ketz). Even though the Sefirot are seen only as a flash, there is no limit to the insight that they can imbue to the individual. His word in them is \"mnning and returning\" This also alludes to the verse, \"And the Chayot running and returning, like the appearance of lightning\" (Ezekiel 1:14). It is dis­cussed again later (I :8)."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"54 SEFER YETZIRAH The phrase \"His word \" is Devaro (i1,;11). Others , however, voca­lize this Dabru (nY)), which means \"they speak.\" This line then reads, \"They speak of them as running and returning.\" 1\" This teaches that one cannot focus for any length of time on any of the Sefirot. The mind can concentrate and see them as a \"flash of lightning,\" but only for an instant. Then one must return. One oscillates between \"running\" and \"re turning,\" peeking for an instant. and then immediately returning to one's normal mental state.1 34 The Kabbalists note that \"running\" denotes Chakhmah, while \"returning\" implies Binah.135 As discussed earlier, one can only visualize the Sefirot with C hakhmah consciousness, through the nonverbal part of the mind. Such Chakhmah consciousness is very difficult to maintain, since the mind normally functions in a state o f verbal Binah consciousness. As mentioned earlier (I :4), the only way to attain Chakhmah conscious­ness i s to swing back and forth between Chakhmah and Binah. It is only during the instant of pure Chakhmah consciousness that the Sefi rot can be perceived. In Hebrew, the word \"run\" is usually Rutz (y11). Here, however, the commentaries note that the root o f the word is Ratza (I'(Y1), and this is apparently the only place in the entire Bible where this root is fou nd.136 Accord ing to the Midrash, t his root is related both to Rutz, \"to run,\" and to Ratzah (:1Y1), meaning to \"will\" or \"desire.\"137 The word Ratza (�Y1) therefore has the implication of \"running with one's will,\" or impelling the will to concentrate on something beyond its grasp. This indicates the mental effort through which the Sefirot are visualized. The Sefer Yetzirah relates \" running and returning\" to speech. Speech exists only in relation to Binah consciousness, since this is the verbal part of the mind. As long as a person i s normally in a state of Binah consciousness, he can only visualize the Sefirot as a flash, \"running and return ing.\" The_v rush to His saying like a whirlwind The Sefer Yetzirah says that God's \"speech in them runs and return s.\" God's speech can be visualized through the Sefirot. but it \"runs and returns.\" \"Speech\" (Damr) refers to the general concept, while a \"saying\" (.\\fa 'amm) denotes a particular statement. It is only with regard to"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Chapter One 55 t he generic \"speech\" that the Sefirot oscillate, \"running and return in g.\" But when there is a M a 'a mar, a specific saying or edict, they no longer oscillate, but rush \"like a whirlwind.\" Accord ing to the reading, \"His speech in them runs and return s,\" this entire section is speaking of the Sefirot. One normally sees the Sefirot \"running and returning,\" like flashes of lightning. But when a particular edict fr om God is present, they no longer oscillate, but pur­sue it \"like a whirlwind.\" According to the commentaries who interpret this line as \"they speak of them running and returning,\" the entire text is speaking of \"they,\" namely the masters and prophets. Although they normally only visualize the Sefirot \"running and returning, \" when a specific edict fr om God was heard, they would pursue it like a whirlwind, going far beyond their normal bounds. The Hebrew word for whirlwind here is Sufah, a term that occurs many times in the Bible.138 The word Sufah (;'!!l10) comes from the root Safah (;'!!lO), meaning \"to annihilate.\" Thus, according to many commentaries, it is the most powerful and destructive wind possi­ble.139 It is also related to the word Sof ( '110), meaning a limit or boundary. As one authority explains, a Sufah is a wind that excedes the normal bounds of natural weather.140 This teaches that when there is an edict from God, the mystic can go far beyond the normal bounds to pursue it. The fact that he is pursuing a divine \"saying\" allows him to have access to much higher states of consciousness t han the normally can attain. It is for this reason that many mystics would engage in medita­tions related to the observance of various commandments. They were making use of God's \"saying\" and edict, and in this manner, were able to reach much higher levels than usual. The divine \"saying\" asso­ciated with the commandment would also serve to attract the Sefirot and make them more accessible. There are two types of storm wind, a Sa'arah and a Sufah.141 A Sa 'ara h is a wind that merely agitates (Sa 'ar), while a Sufah is a hurri­cane that sweeps away everything in its path.14\" At the beginning of the mystical experience, Ezekiel says that he saw a \"storm wind (sa'arah) coming fr om the north\" (Ezekiel 1:4 ). Accord ing to some commentaries, this refers to the agitation of the mind when one enters the transcendental realm.14' The vehicle through which one rises and enters the mystical realm is called a Markava (chariot), and the art of engaging in this practice is called \"working in the Chariot\" (Ma'aseh Markava).144 It is therefore highly significant that the scripture states, \"His Chariot (markava) is like a whirlwind (SL{{ah)\" (Isaiah 66: 15). 145 This indicates"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"56 SEFER YETZIRAH that the ,<,'u(ah wind acts like a Chariot, conveying one into the mysti cal realm. It is a force that carries one beyond the normal limit (sot) into the transcendental. Saadia Gaon interprets Sl(/ah to denote the dust devils that one sees in small whirlwinds. where the dust assumes many shapes and forms. These forms constantly change. and a distinct form lasts only for a moment. Similarly, when one visualizes the Sefirot. one can see them in many forms. but like sand devils. they last only for an instant. and then dissolve. Bej(Jre His Th rone they prostrate themselves As discussed earlier (I :4 ), when we speak of God as \"sitting,\" it means that He is lowering His essence so as to be concerned with His creation. His Throne is the object upon which He sits, and hence, it denotes the vehicle of such lowering and concern . While \"sitting\" is a lowering that one does on one's own initia­t i ve. prostrating oneself and bowing is a lowering that one does because of a higher power. The tools of God's concern are the Sefirot, since it is through them that He directs the universe. As a result of the concept of God's Throne. the Sefi rot must also lower their essence and interact with the lower world. The Sefer Yetzirah there­fore says. \"before His Throne they prostrate themselves.\" The universe of the Scfirot is called Atzilut. Below it is Beriyah, the world of the Throne. As Ezekiel describes it. \"Above the firma­ment that was over their heads was the likeness of a Throne ... and upon the likeness of the Throne. was a likeness of the appearance of a Man\" (Ezekiel I :26). The Throne is in the universe of Beriyah, while the \"Man\" on the Throne represents the anthropomorphic array of the Sefi rot in Atzilut. The highest universe that can actually be visualized is Yetzirah, the world of the angels. In this world, one can visualize a reflection of the Throne. and hence, Ezekiel said that he saw '\"the likeness of a Thro ne.\" One can also see a \"reflection of a reflection\" of the Sefirot. and he therefore saw. \" the likeness of the appearance of a Man.\" When the Sefer Yetzirah says that the Sefirot \" prostrate them­selves.\" he is indicating that they are reflected in the lower universes. Since they prostrate themselves before God's Throne. which is in Beriyah. they arc even visible in Yetzirah. It is in the universe of Y etzirah that a reflection of the Sefirot is visualized."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"1:7 ( 'haprer One j n�nn1 j n� nnJ j!J10 r1v) :1r.J'�J !111'!JO 1WV p�, 1'n' j11�W n�m.J ;111wp n.J;,�w:;, jD10.J :1!)10 ;1!1� ;17.:) 1n� 'JD�1 'JW 1� Te n ,C.,'e(irot of Nothingness Th eir end is imbedded in their beginning and their beginning in their end like a flame in a burning coal For the Master is singular He has no second ..lnd before One, 11·hat do you count? Their end is imbedded in their beginning 57 Accord ing to most commentaries. the \"beginning\" is Keter (Crown), while the \" end\" is Malkhut (Kingship). These are the two end points of the spiritual dimension. In the most basic leveL Keter is seen as the concept of Cause, while Malkhut is the archetype of Effect. Since a cause cannot exist without an effect, and an effect cannot exist without a cause, the two are interdependent on each other. The Sefer Yetzirah likens this to a \"flame bound to a burning coal.\" A flame cannot exist without the coal, and the burning coal cannot exist without the flame. Although the coal is the cause of the flame, the flame is also the cause of the burning coal. Without the flame, it would not be a burning coal. Since Cause cannot exist without Effect, Effect is also the cause of Cause. In this sense, Effect is the cause, and Cause is the effect. Since beginning and end are inseparable, \"their end is imbedded in their beginning, and their beginning in their end.\" Thus, even though Keter is Cause and Malkhut is Effect, there is also a sense in which Malkhut is the cause of Keter. Often i n Kabbalah, where such a situation exists, Keter is seen as existing on a lower level than Malkhut. Thus, for example, Keter of Beriyah is below Malkhut of Atzilut, and Keter of Yetzirah is below Malkhut of Beriyah. As discussed earlier, there is no term that can be used to describe God. God Himself cannot even be called the Cause.146 A cause is to some degree dependent on its effect, and God cannot be dependent on anything. The Kabbalists therefore teach that before creating any-"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"5S SEFER YETZIRAH N () Figure /0. A circle 11·irh 0 and N as fii'O anripodal poinrs. thing else, God created the concept of \"Cause.\" This is the Sefirah of Kctcr (Crown). Keter is also often identified with Will. This, how­ever. is an anthropomorphism, since in man, will is the cause of all action.147 The Sefer Yetzirah therefore states that \"the Master is singular, He has no second.\" The Sefirot may be interdependent, but this does not include the Infinite Being. Since God is absolutely unitary, He cannot even be called the Cause. since this would imply an effect as a \"second.\" When we view the Sefirot as being ten directions in a fi ve­di mensional continuum, we can also interpret this in another man­ner. Every pair of Sefirot defines an infinite line, extended infinitely in both directions. The end points of such an infinite line, however, come together and meet once again at the \"point at infinity.\" This is a fact recognized by mathematicians, and considerable use of the \"point at infinity\" is found in complex analysis, the calculus of com­plex numbers. Although this is a highly abstract concept, it is not that difficult to understand. Imagine a circle, with two antipodal points, 0 and N. Obviously, two lines extending outward from 0 will once again come together at point N. But then what happens if we make the circle infi­nitely large? The larger the circle, the closer the curve approaches a straight line. In the limit where the circle becomes infinitely large, the lines extending outward fr om point 0 actually become straight. But st ill, they come together at point N. This point at infinity is where all endpoints meet. 148 Sec figure I 0. In our three-dimensional continuum, we can likewise extend all lines o utward infinitely. The end points of all these lines would then be an infinite sphere surrounding all space. However, each opposing pair of lines would meet at the point at infinity. and therefore, all outgoing lines must meet at this point.1 4Y"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Chapter One 59 Thus, in one sense, the entire three-dimensional space contin­uum can be seen as surrounded by an infinite sphere. In another sense, however, this entire infinite sphere can also be represented by a si ngle point -the point at infinity. A point, however, is infinitely small. Thus, the point at infinity can be seen as being both infinitely large and infinitely small at the same time. The same argument can easily be extended to the five­dimensional hyperspace discussed in Sefer Yetzirah. Thus, if every pair of Sefirot defines an infinite line, the begin­ning of each line is \" imbedded\" in its end. This is true of all the Sefirot. All opposites, in their extreme case, become joined as one. One can use this as a meditation. Try to imagine the sphere at infinity and the point at infinity, and attempt to perceive how they are actually one. You will then see that your usual conception of space and extension are not as simple as you believe. In particular, this is true of the Keter-Malkhut line. In t he direc­tion of Keter, this line extends infinitely toward God, the ultimate Good. In the Malkhut direction, it extends infinitely away from God, toward ultimate evil. These two end points can also be viewed as the ultimately spiritual and the ultimately physical. I n this sense, we must therefore say that the ultimately physical and the ultimately spiritual are \"imbedded\" in each other. In order to understand this more deeply, we must first ask some questions. The most basic question is: Why did God create a physical world? God created the universe to bestow good to His creation, but this good is purely spiritual. This being true, what need is there for a physical world? Before we can answer this question, we must first ask another question. What is the difference between the material and the spiritual? We speak of the material and the spiritual as two different con­cepts. We know that the spiritual is not material. But precisely what is the difference? The answer should be obvious. The main difference between the material and spiritual involves space. Physical space only exists in the physical world. In the spiritual, there is no space as we know it. Although concepts of distance and closeness exist in the spiritual realm, they do not have the same meaning as they do in the physical world. In a spiritual sense, closeness involves resemblance. Two things that resemble each other are said to be spiritually close. Two things that differ, on the other hand, are far apart in a spiritual sense. This has very important implications. In the spiritual world, it is utterly impossible to bring two opposites together. B ecause they arc opposite, they arc by definition, poles apart."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"60 SEFER YETZIR.-\\H Thus. for e xample, God and man are worlds apart-\"as the heav­ens arc higher than the earth.\" On a purely spiritual plane, it would be totally impossible for the two ever to be brought together. It was for this reason that God created the concept of space. Spiritual things can be bound to the material. just as, for example, the soul is bound to the body. Two opposites can then be brought together by being bound to physical objects. In the physical world, space exists, and two oppo­sites can literally be pushed together. Furthermore, two spiritual opposites can even be bound to the same material object. 150 Thus. for example. man has both an urge for good and an urge for evil, the Yet::: er To r. and the Yet::: er HaRa. In a purely spiritual sense. these are poles apart. Without a physical world, they could never be brought together in a single entity. The archetype of the spiritual being is the angel. Since an angel has no body, it can never contain both good and evil in its being. Our sages therefore teach us that angels have no Yetzer HaRa.15 1 It is only in a physical being that both good and evil can exist together. Although they are at opposite poles spiritually, they can come together in the physical man. One reason why God created man in a physical world was to allow him to have full freedom of choice, with both good and evil as part of his makeup. Without a physical world. these two concepts could never exist in the same being.15\" The fact that good and evil can exist in the same physical space also allows good to overcome evil in this world. Here again, this is only possible in a physical world. In a purely spiritual arena, good could never come close enough to evil to have any influence over it. In the physical world, however, good and evil can exist together, and good can therefore overcome evil. Our sages thus teach us that one of the main reasons why man was placed in the physical world was to overcome the forces of evil. 153 The Zohar expresses it by stating that we are here \"to turn darkness into light.\"1 54 The entire concept of the nonphysical is very difficult to compre­hend. and may be clarified by a remarkable teaching of our sages. The Midrash tells us, \"One angel cannot have two missions. Neither can two angels share the same mission.\"155 This teaching brings our entire discussion into focus. The angel is the archetype of the nonphysical being. When we speak of an angel, we are speaking of an entity that exists purely on a spiritual plane. Angels can be differentiated only by their mission, that is, by their involvement and attachment to some physical thing. Two angels therefore cannot share the same mission. It is only their different missions that make the two angels different entities. They cannot be separated by space like physical objects.156 Therefore,"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"( 'haflll'r One 61 if they both had the same mission. there would be nothing to differ­entiate them. and they would be one. Similarly, one angel cannot have two missions. On a purely spiri tual plane. two different con­cepts cannot exist in a single entity. If an angel had two missions, then it would be two angels. We can also understand this in terms of the human mind. In a sense, the mind is a pure spiritual entity, bound to man's physical brain. Many thoughts and memories may be bound together by man's physical brain, but the mind can only focus on one of them at a time. In simple terms, a person can only think of one thing at a time. A thought is a spiritual entity, and as such, can only contain a single concept. Since both a thought and an angel are basic spiritual entities, this is very closely related to the fact that an angel can only have a si ngle mission.1 57 For a similar reason, angels hav e no way of knowing anything that does not pertain to their particular mission. An angel may be created initially with a vast storehouse of knowledge, but it has no way of increasing it, at least, not beyond its own sphere of activity. Thus, fo r example, we find one angel asking another a question: \"And one [angel] said to the Man dressed in linen ... 'How long shall it be until the end of these wonders\"' (Daniel 12:6)? One angel had to ask the other, because he himself could not know something outside of his own domain.15H In the physical world. we can learn things through our five senses. We can hear, feeL smell and taste. Our knowlege of things comes from our physical proximity to them. In the spiritual worlds, however, this does not exist. The only way that one can learn about a thing is to come into spiritual proximity with it. An angel cannot do this outside of his own realm. Man therefore has an advantage over an angel. The very fact that he exists in this lower world enables him to reach up ever higher. There are concepts of good decreed by God, and as His decrees, they arc intimately bound to Him. When a man physically involves himself with these good concepts, he literally binds himself to God. He thus achieves a closeness that no angel could ever hope to rcach.15� This is a major difference between a man and an angel. An angel is assigned to one spiritual station, and has no way to rise any higher. Thus, when t he prophet speaks of angels, he says, \"Around Him, the seraphim stood\" (Isaiah 6:2). Angels are described as standing and stationary. But when God speaks to man, He tells him, \"If you walk in My ways ... then I will give you a place to move among those who stand here \" (Zechariah 3:7). God was showing the prophet a vision of stationary angels, and telling him that he would be able to move"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"62 SEFER YETZIRAH Tahk 10. Unification of the Sctirot. Apex of Yud Yud :1 Heh Yav :1 Hch Kcter Chakhmah Binah Chesed, Gevurah, Tiferet, Netzach, Hod, Yesod Malkhut among them. Man can move from level to level, but angels are bound to their particular plane.1611 There arc many levels in the spiritual world. If only the spiritual would exist, t here would be no way for these to come together. The only thing that can possibly unify these levels is their relationship to the physical world. In order to reach the highest levels of holiness, man must there­fo re become part of the physical world. When he obeys God's com­mandments. he attaches himself to the same physical objects as the One who gave the commandments. In obeying these commandments, man therefore attaches himself to God to the greatest possible degree. He is thus able to scale the highest spiritual heights. This is the symbolism of Jacob's dream in which he saw, \"A ladder standing on earth, whose top reached the heavens\" (Genesis 28: 12). It is only through earthly deeds that we can climb the loftiest heights. The different levels of the spiritual world, the rungs ofthe \"ladder,\" can only be bound together when they are \"standing on the earth.\"161 The Scfirot arc not physical, and do not appear to be attached to any physical concept. Since they represent different concepts and levels, the question then arises: How can they interact? Obviously, the only possible way is through some relationship with the physical world. It is only when two different Sefirot c ome together and inter­act with the same physical object that they can also interact with each other. The Kabbalists therefore engage in many physical activities with the primary intent of \"unifying the Sefirot.\" Another way in which t he Sefirot are unified is through the Divine Names. This is especially true of the Tetragrammaton, YHYH (:11:1•). According to the Kabbalists, the apex of the Yud (•) represents Kctcr. the Yud itself, Chakhmah, the initial Heh (:-t), Binah, the Yav (1), which has a numerical value of six, the next six Sefirot. and the final Heh, Malkhut. See Table I 0. The very fact that this Name can be written on a physical piece of paper. where the letters representing the Sefirot are brought together, serves to unify the Sefirot. Each Sefirah is associated with"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"C 'h apter One 63 a letter. and when these letters are physically brought together, the Sefirot can also interact. Specific interactions involving the Sefirot can also be brought about when various names are combined. The same i s also true of other Kabbalist i c diagrams and representations of the Scfirot. Even though the Sefirot were created before the physical world, they exist i n a domain that i s above time, where past, present and future arc one. The very fact that they would have physical counter­parts in the future provided them with a link with the physi cal world. Since God willed that at some future time, the letters of the Name would be able to be represented by physical forms and be written on a physical medium, they had an association with the physical even before it was created. This allowed the Sefirot to interact, even before the creation of the physical universe.1 \"\" The same is true of the other letters of the alphabet. Although the letters are best known as they are written down physically, they actually also represent spiritual forces. Through various combina­tions of the letters, the spiritual forces associated with them are brought together in various effective combi nations. These spiritual forces arc the \" letters with which heaven and earth were created.\" From all this, we see that there is an important link between the physical and the spiritual. Even Keter, the highest of the Sefirot, has a physical representation in the apex of the Yud of the Divine Name. This is also realted to our earlier d iscussion of cause and effect. The highest level of Keter is the ulti mate cause, while the physi cal world i s the ultimate effect. Like a flame in a burning coal In describing the relationship between the physical and the spir­itual. the Z ohar uses an expression very similar to that used here. T he Z ohar states: \"If one wishes to know the wisdom of the holy uni­fi cation, let him look at the flame rising from a burning coal or fr om a kindled lamp. The flame cannot rise unless i t is unified w i t h some­thing physica l.\"16' From the context, it is evident that the Zohar is speaking of the different parts of the flame. The only way in which the flame can rise is for all of these parts to come together. This is only possible when the flame is attached to the physical coal or wick. In a similar man­ner. all the spiritual levels cannot function or interact unless they are bound to the physi cal."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"64 SEFER YETZIRAH The Sefer Yetzirah therefore states that \"their end is imbedded in their beginning ... like a flame in a burning coal. \" The only way in which the end and beginning can interact is because both are bound to related physical concepts. This can also be used as a meditation.1 64 The wick itself repre­sents the physical world, while the blue flame nearest to the wick is the counterpart of Malkhut.165 Surrounding this is the bright yellow flame, corresponding to the next six Sefirot: Chesed, Gevurah, Tiferet, Netzach, Hod and Yesod. Above this is the barely visible exterior flame, the hottest part of all, paralleling Binah. Then comes the light radiating fr om the candle, which is Chakhmah. Finally, there is the concept of flame itself, and this corresponds to Keter. All of these parts are unified only through the wick. By contem­plating a flame in this manner, one can bind himself to the Ten Sefirot. I t is for this reason that the Sefer Yetzirah states that the Ten Sefirot parallel the ten directions. Even though the Sefirot are purely spiritual, the very fact that they are associated with the physical directions serves to unify them. Then, as it were. the point at infinity in the five-dimensional hyperspace would represent the unapproach­able Infinite. The great Kabbalist. Rabbi Abraham Abulafia, notes that the Hebrew word for \"coal,\" Gachelet (n�m), has a numerical value of 441. This is the same as the value of Emet (no�). meaning \"truth.\"166 It is Truth that binds all opposites together. This is indicated by the word itself. The word Emet begins with an Alef (�). the first letter of the alphabet. and ends with a Tav (1\"1), the last letter. Thus, the \"end is imbedded in the beginning.\" This is accomplished through the Mem (o). the middle letter of the alphabet. Another master Kabbalist. Rabbi Joseph Gikatalia (1248-1 323), points out that Alef and Tav are also the fi rst letters of the word Atah (:11\"1�). meaning \"Thou.\" The Heh (:1) at the end of t his word, which has a numercial value of fi ve, represents Binah, as expressed in the five books of the Torah, and in the fi ve phonetic families of the alphabet. 167 In order to address God as \"Thou,\" we must fi rst \"imbed the beginning (Alef) in the end (Tav).\" Only then can we address Him through the letters of the Torah, represented by the Heh. For the Master is Singular Besides being brought together by their assoCiatiOn with the physical world. the Sefirot are also unified by God Himself. In his"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Chapter One 65 prayer, Elijah thus says regarding the Sefirot, \"You bind them, and You unify them,\"168 When the Ten Sefirot are represented as the ten directions, the physical can be taken as the zero point, fr om which they all eminate. God, as it were, can be said t o parallel the point at infinity, where they all converge. Of course, God has no representation whatever, but this is the closest that the human mind can come to imagining a representation. By contemplating the point at infinity, one can approach a conception of the Infinite Being. This point at infinity is both infinitely large and infinitely small. It does not have any defined place in the continuum of space, time, or the spiritual. It has neither shape nor form, yet, at the same time, it is defined as a single, unitary, undifferentiated point. A ll of this is also true of God. Of course, God is much more than this. In describing God here, the Sefer Yetzirah does not say that He is one (Echad), but that He is singular (Yachid). It is saying that God is so absolutely singular that there is no quality whatever that can be attributed to Him. As the philosophers state, we cannot describe God with any quality or adjective whatever, only with negative attributes or attributes of action.169 Although we cannot say what God is, by using negative attributes, we can say what He is not. Similarly, with attributes of action, we can speak of what God does. This also implies that God is absolutely simple. In the domain that existed before creation, there was nothing other than God. As mentioned earlier, even such simple concepts as Cause and Effect had to be created. The same is true of number. If the concept o f \"oneness\" existed in God, this would imply that the concept of number exists in His essence. This in itself would introduce an elelment of plurality. One could then speak of God and His \"oneness,\" that is, His association with the number one. \"God\" and \"His oneness\" would then be two concepts. The Hebrew word Echad denotes an association with the number one. Ya chid, on the other hand, is a negative attribute, indicating the absence of any plurality whatever. He has no second This is based on the verse, \"There is One, He has no second, He has neither son nor brother\" (Ecclesiastes 4:8)."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"66 SEFER YETZIRAH Before one, H'hat do you count How can one count before the concept of \"one\" came into exis­tence.

As discussed earlier (I: I), the concept of numbers did not come into existence until the creation of the Sefirot. which were the first c lements of numerality and plurality in creation. The con­cept of \"one\" did not come into being until the Sefirah of Keter was created.

The essence of the Sefirot can only be attained when one bridles one's lips fr om speaking. and closes one's mind to all verbal and depictive thought. Only when one makes the mind completely blank can the Sefirot be experienced.

All such techniques, however, are only a means through which the mind is cleared of all thought. The"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"C 'haprer One 67 actual experience of the Sefirot only comes after one stops using the technique and remains absolutely still, with all the thought processes hushed.1 70 And your he art from thinking In Kabbalah, the term \"heart\" usually denotes Binah.171 It indi­cates the verbal part of the mind, which is the seat of Binah con­sciousness. This Binah consciousness must be \"bridled\" so the Sefirot can be experienced with Chakhmah consciousness alone. And ({your heart runs Here. \" heart \" again refers to Binah consciousness. The Sefirot must be experienced with Chakhmah consciousness. If one tries to depict them with Binah (the \"heart\"), then the mind can become engulfed in a profusion of symbolism. As the Kabbalists explain, this is very dangerous. since the mind can be swallowed up in this kal eidescope of symbolism, and n ot be abl e to emerge fr om it.172 This is what happened to Ben Zomah, who lost his mind when he entered Paradise.1 73 This \"running\" consists of a rapid profusion of symbolism, either verbal or visual. 174 If the \"heart runs,\" the Sefer Yetzirah warns that o ne should \"return to the place.\" He must focus on something physi­cal , so as to restore spiritual equalibrium.175 In this respect, o n e must emulate the Chayot, the \"living angels\" seen by Ezekiel in his vision. One must oscillate between \" running and returning.\" Since one can only think with Binah consciousness, one must use it to swing into Chakhmah consciousness. This state can o nly be maintained for a short time, whereupon Binah conscious­ness returns, and one tries to depict his experience. At this point, one must immediately return to the physical. In this manner, one can oscillate back and forth, reaching higher each time.176 A cove nant was made From the context, this covenant is a mutual agreement between God and the mystic.

In more general terms, a covenant is something that comes between two things and joins them. This is the covenant that joins the spiritual and the physical. In particular, as the Sefer Yetzirah states (1 :3), a covenant denotes circumcision. One of the reasons for circumcisions is to indi­cate that one should be able to control one's sexual passions. 178 Com­munion with the spiritual is also sexual in a sense, and the covenant of circumcision also helps to control this passion. A person who can control his sexual passions even at the height of desire, can also con­trol his mind when it enters the spiritual realm. According to some critical studies, this line is the end of the most ancient part of the text. The Sefer Yetzirah (6:7) also appears t o indi­cate that the covenant mentioned here was that which God made with Abraham. What the text might be saying is that, regarding every­thing that has been written up to this point, a covenant was made, possibly with Abraham. 1:9 O\"n 0':1'?N n11 .nnN :1r.J''i:l .n11'!30 1WV nn1 'i1j?

We therefore see that the \"Breath of God\" comes before Wisdom and Understanding. Among t he Sefirot, then, this corresponds to Keter.1xo As the Talmud says, it was through this \"Breath of God\" that Betzalel was able to manipulate the letters of creation. The word ruach, which we translate here as \"breath,\" is also the word for wind, and the Sefer Yetzirah also apparently uses it as the term for air. This word, however, is often used in the Bible to denote spirit. and this is the sense that it is used here. In general, the word ruach indicates motion and communication. It is related to the words 0-rach, meaning a path, and 0-reach, mean­ing a guest. The spirit (ruach) of life in an animal is the power that causes it to move. Normally. the air is invisible and undetectable. It is only when it moves that one can fe el it as a wind or breath. Similarly, the spirit­ual continuum is undetectable, except when it moves. It is then experienced as spirit (ruach). Hence, ruach is the word for wind, breath, and spirit. This is also describing the act of creation. The analogy would be the formation of a glass vessel.18 1 First the breath (ruach) eminates from the mouth of the glassblower. The vessel is shaped through the interaction of the breath, where the wind bounding off the walls causes pressure. The vessel then expands in all spacial directions. Living God As mentioned above (I: I). the term \"Living God\" (Elohim Chayim) denotes Yesod (Foundation), when this Sefirah is in a pro­creative mode, disbursing all the forces of creation. The \" spirit\" here, which is fr om Keter. is that which is ultimately disbursed by Yesod. Since Keter itself cannot be experienced, it is referred to in terms of Yesod. since that is where it is experienced.18c Blessed and Benedicted In other ancient Kabbalah texts. such as the Bahir, these adjec­tives are also used with regard to Keter.183"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"70 SEFER YETZIRAH In Hebrew. the two terms here are Barukh (111:1) and MeBhorakh (p:JIJ). Both words actually mean \"blessed. \" Barukh denotes that God is intrinsically blessed, while MeBorakh implies that He is blessed by others in prayer. When we say that God is \"blessed,\" this means that His essence is brought down. so as to interact with His creation and \"bless\" it.1 84 Hence, it is related to the word Berekh (11:1), meaning \"knee.\" Just as the knee. when it is bent, serves to lower the body, so a blessing serves to lower the Divine. This is closely related to the concept of sitting. discussed above (I :4 ). God has an intrinsic mode through which He brings His essence to bear on His creation. In this respect, He is called Barukh. His essence is also brought to bear to a greater degree as a result of prayer and similar actions. In this respect He is said to be MeBhorakh. Life qf Worlds This also refers to the Sefi rah of Yesod (Foundation), but in a mode where it bestows spiritual influx and life to the universes below Atzilut. It is therefore called \"Life of Jiorlds.\" Voice qf Breath and Speech These were the tools of creation, as it is written, \"With the Word of God, the heavens were made. and with the Breath (Ruach) of His mouth. all their hosts\" (Psalms 33:6). According to the Talmud, this alludes to the first Saying of creation, that is, to Keter.1s5 Voi ce (ko[) is pure inarticulate sound, and as such, it is related to Chakhmah. Speech. on the other hand. is articulate and related to Binah. These two opposites are then connected by \"Breath\" (Ruach). This can also be interpreted in terms of creation. \"Voice\" is pure, inart iculated creative force. It is alluded to in the first verse of the Torah. \"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.\" The Talmud staes that this was the first of the Ten Saying with which the world was created.1�6 This is an inarticulate Saying, since only the accomplishment, and not the saying, is recorded in the Torah. Right after this. the Torah reports, \"The breath of God (Ruach E/ohim) hovered on the face of the water\" (Genesis I :2). This is \"Breath\" or Spirit (Ruach). It is only after this that God speaks and says, \"Let there be light\" (Genesis I :3).

Ruach HaKodesh is the divine inspiration and information that one can bring back fr om a state of Chakhmah consciousness to one's normal state of Binah consciousness. Such Ruach HaKodesh is like Keter, which stands between Chakhmah and Binah, but which is above them. Both Chakhmah and Binah are functions of the mind itself, while Ruach HaKodesh comes from without. It is therefore likened to Keter, since a crown is worn above the head and is external to it. This Ruach HaKodesh is the \"breath of God\" mentioned in the verse, \"I will fill him with the Breath of God, with Wisdom, Understanding, and Knowledge.\"1 88 1:10 o�!1t71 o�1t7V :-i:J :J�m ppn n11rJ m1 o�nt7 o�nt71 n,t,,�_, V:Jt71 nmN t7t,t7 110� .rwmN :j:-irJ .nn� m1, .nm1ru!:l :11tu31 Two: Breath fr om Breath.

This second \"Breath fr om"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"72 SEFER YETZIRAH Breath,\" associated with Malkhut is called Reflected Light (Or Cho::er). 1 90 Using the analogy of the glassblower above, this is the breath that bounces off the walls of the vessel being formed. In a conceptual sense, the Direct Light is the concept of causal­ity, where Keter is the Cause of all things. As mentioned above, how­ever, Cause cannot exist without Effect, and hence. Effect is also the cause of Cause. Malkhut, the Effect, is therefore also the Cause, and this the concept of Reflected Light. The Kabbalists often speak of Lights and Vessels. \"Light\" denotes the concept of giving, while Vessels indicate that o f accepting and receiving. The Kabbalists also teach that the Vessels came into being through the \"collision\" between Direct Light and Reflected Ligh t. 191 These Vessels are the letters of the alphabet.192 The Sefer Yetzirah therefore speaks of \"Breath\" and of \"Breath fr om Breath.\" The first \"Breath\" denotes the simple breath that eminates fr om the lungs and throat. \"Breath fr om Breath\" is that which is reflected by the various parts of the mouth to produce the sounds of speech.1 93 It is through the interaction of direct and reflected breath that sounds are produced. In man. this takes place in the mouth, while in the Sefirot, it occurs in Malkhut. It is for this reason that the Tikkuney Zohar speaks of Malkhut as the \"Mouth.\" 194 It is also through Malkhut that all images of the higher Sefirot are reflected so that they should be visualized.195 The Sefcr Yetzirah therefore says that the 22 letters were created through this second Sefirah. Engraved and carved As discussed earlier (I: I), the word Chakak, which is translated as \"engrave,\" denotes the removal of material. The letters came into existence when the reflected breath removes portions of the direct breath. This takes place through the various motions of the mouth. The second process is Chat:::av, which is translated as \"carve\" or \"quarry.\" This denotes separating material fr om its source, as in the verse. \"From its mountains, you quarry (chatzav) copper\" (Deuteron­omy 8:9). It also refers to \"quarrying\" in a spiritual sense, as in, \"Look at [God] the Rock from which you were quarried (chatzav)\" (Isaiah 5 1: I ). 19\" The word Chat:::av thus denotes the process wherein the letter sounds leave the mouth and are expressed independently. In this con­text, \"Engrave\" (chakak) indicates the articulation and pronunciation of the sounds, and \"carve\" (chatzav) denotes their expression.197"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Chapter One 73 From the last section of Sefer Yetzirah (6:7), we also see that \"engraving\" and \"carving\" denote meditative process.

Since Malkhut is called the \"Mouth,\" the spirit eminating fr om it is called \"speech.\" Just like physical speech, this consists of \"words,\" which in turn are comprised of \"letters.\" Some authorities interpret this phrase, \"And breath is one of them.\" This is because Breath (Ruach) is associated with the letter Alef, as below (3:7). 198 1:11 .rn� .n,� :J\":l F1:J :JYn, rrn n,ir.J t:l'r.J \"te!�\"te! :1l,iV pr.J:l ii'i'n ��m W!)i ,:1:J, ,:1.nr.J o:1��v pY�, :1:J�tvr.J prJ:l o:J:J�o :1rJm PrJ-' r:J:!m :ri� �}:1 irJ�' lt,t't, '-' irJ�Jt' i!)V ;\"!t'VJ, lt,t' Th ree: J,Vater .fi\"om Breath.

Structure must be imposed on i t fr om without. The process described by Sefer Yetzirah is alluded to in the verse. \"He makes His breath (ruach) blow, the waters flow\" (Psalms 147:1 8).�01 The analogy is rain, which is formed when warm, moist air col­lides with cold air. Similarly, the interaction of direct and reflected breath creates the Sefi rah ofChakhmah. Just as rain falls in all things alike. so Chakhmah bestows God's blessing on all things without dis­tinction. coc Just like air can hold moisture, so Chakhmah is implied in the \"Breath\" that is Keter. The parallel between Chakhmah and rain is described in the verses (Isaiah 55:9-11): As the heaven is higher than the earth so are My ways higher than your ways and M.v thoughts, than your thoughts. But as the ra in and snow descend fr om heaven and return not there without watering the earth making it bloom and bud gi1·ing seed to the sower and bread to he 1vho eats. So the II'Ord that eminates fr om My mouth shalf not return to me emptyhanded ll'ithout accomplishing that which I please and succeeding in its mission. Here God is saying that His \"thought,\" which is Chakhmah, is as far above the human mind as the sky is above the earth. But just as rain can descend fr om the sky, so can God's Wisdom come down to man, accomplishing what He desires. The difference between breath and water is that breath must be blown downward, while water falls on its own.ccn The spiritual essence implied by Keter can only be granted by God's direct inter­vention and wilJ.2°4 That implied by Chakhmah, on the other hand, descends to lower levels on its own. In a psychological sense, Keter represents Ruach HaKodesh, the divine inspiration that can only be granted by God. Wisdom, on the other hand. can be gained by man on his own. If man makes himself into a vessel for Chakhmah. it comes down to him automatically. In this respect, it is like rain, which can be used by anyone who has a proper vessel to hold it.

It is because of Chakhmah that the course of nature can exist. In a physical sense, water is said to allude to the undifferentiated primeval matter.205 With them He engraved Here the Sefer Yetzirah is speaking about the beginnings of writ­ten letters. The spoken letters arise from breath, but for the written letters to exist, there must exist a writing fluid, such as ink. This implies the liquid state, of which the prototype is water. The writing fluid is spoken of as \"mire and clay.\" Chaos and Void Tohu and Bohu in Hebrew. This alludes to the initial state of cre­ation. as it is written, \"The earth was chaos and void\" (Genesis I :2). The Sefer Yetzirah later says that it was out of this chaos (tohu) that substance was formed (2:6). To hu denotes pure substance that does not contain information. Bohu is pure information that does not relate to any substance.206 Both are undifferentiated, and are therefore included in Chakhmah. With Bohu (information), the alphabet letters could be engraved on Tohu (substance). The scripture states that, \"the earth was chaos and void.\" The Kabbalists note that \" earth\" (eretz) is a feminine word, and teach that it alludes to Malkhut, the archetype of the feminine. \"Chaos and void,\" which related to Chakhmah, did not come into existence until after Malkhut. This is the same as the order of the Sefer Yetzirah, which also places Chakhmah after Malkhut.207 Mire and clay In Hebrew, mire is Refesh, and clay is Tyt. The only place in t he Bible where the two are mentioned together is in the verse, \"The wicked are like the troubled sea. It cannot rest, and its waters cast up mire and clay\" (Isaiah 57:20). In describing the original state of creation, the Torah states, \"The earth was chaos and void, and darkness on the face of the deep (lehom)\" (Genesis I :2). According to the commentaries, the word 7chom denotes the mud and clay on the bottom of the sea.2°8 \"Chaos and void\" allude to the interaction between Chakhmah (water) and Keter (Breath). \"Mire and clay\" allude to the interaction"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"76 SEFER YETZIRAH between Chakhmah (water) and Malkhut (earth). Mire consists mostly of water. and therefore represents the dominance of Chakmah. Clay consists mostly of earth, and represents the domi­nance o f Malkhut. The mire is the writing fluid, while the clay is the medium upon which it is written. He engraved them ... The Hebrew letters have t hree basic parts, a top, center, and bot­tom. The top and bottom usually consist of heavy horizontal lines, while the center consists of thinner vert ical lines. The bottoms of the letters were \"engraved like a garden.\" This i s where material is removed fr om the matrix, leaving a hollow. The sides of the letters are then \"carved like a wall.\" These are the vertical lines which separate t he letters fr om each other like walls. Finally, the tops of the letters are added, like a ceiling covering the letters. 209 Accord ing to some authorities, this also alludes to the creation of space. 210 As we shall see later (2:4 ). this can also be an instruction for a meditation. He poured snow over them This is omitted in some versions, but the idea is found in the Midrash.211 The liquid state represents fluidity and change, whereas the solid state represents permanence. When the Torah speaks of instability, it uses water as an example, as in the verse, \"unstable like water\" (Genesis 49:4).212 Thus. when Chakmah is in a state of flux, it is rep­resented by water, but when it is in a state of permanence, it is repre­sented by snow. As mentioned earlier. Chakmah has two modes. The first is that of Chakmah consciousness, while the second is that of memory. Chakhmah consciousness is fluid, and is represented by water. Mem­ory, on the other hand, is fixed, and is denoted by snow. The letters themselves represent the fluid state. Like a fluid, at this point. they can be combined in any way t hat one desires. Only after snow is poured over them do they become set and immutable in the solid state. A similar idea is found in the Bahir, which states that before it was given to Israel, the Torah was likened to water, but after it was given. it was likened to stone. 213 Although Chakhmah is nonverbal. and nonvisual, it still repre­sents the source of the letters. It is only after the letters are combined into words that they represent verbal Binah consciousness.

Fire from Water This is Binah (Understanding).214 The process described h ere is a lluded to in the verse, \"Fire kindles water\" (Isaiah 64:1 ).215 We can use t he same analogy as before, where rain is brought about by the confluence of warm and cold air. \"Fire fr om Water\" would then denote the lightning that accompanies a rainstorm. 216 The process would then be alluded to in t he verse, \"God's voice carves out (chot:::ev) flames of fire\" (Psalms 29:8).217 Other commentaries state that this refers to fire kindled by a globe of water used as a burn ing glass.218 According to both interpretations, t he fire is seen as one that is finely focused on one particular place. It is very different than rain, which falls everywhere without distinction. This, however, is an important difference between Binah and Chakhmah. B inah focuses on a single object, while Chakhmah encompasses everything. There is also another important difference between fire and water. Water naturally flows downward, while fire tends to ascend upward. 219 Fire also causes the air above i t to move upward, and prevents it fr om descending. In a similar manner, Binah tends to restrict and curtail the flow of spiritual sustenance (shefa ) downward to the lower spheres. In this respect. it is the precise opposite of Chakhmah. If Chakmah is t he source of giving, t hen Binah is the source of restraint. The analogy of fire and water also refers to t he mental states implied by Chakhmah and Binah. The Midrash states, \"Water con-"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"SEFER YETZIRAH ceived and gave birth to Gloom (Afelah), Fire conceived and gave birth to Light. Breath (Ruach) conceived and gave birth to Wis­dom.\"cco From the statement. \"Breath gave birth to Wisdom,\" we see that this entire passage is speaking of mental states. Water, which represents Chakhmah consciousness, thus gives birth to Gloom and darkness. This is the hushing and nullification of the senses, as well as the cessation of all normal mental processes. Fire. which represents Binah consciousness, then gives rise to light, since it is in this state that visible images are perceived. Just like water is calm and cool, so Chakhmah consciousness is per­fe ctly calm. Indeed . the experience of entering this state may be very much like descending into calm, deep water. It is for this reason that when Rabbi Akiba and his companions entered into the mysteries, he warned them not to say, \"Water, water.\" cc t They should not be misled into thinking that they were actually experiencing physical water. In the realm of Chakhmah consciousness, even the letters only exist in a state o f pure information. This information exists as \" chaos and void.\" which cannot be grasped at all, or as \" mire and clay,\" which are totally opaque. As explained earlier, the information and letters in C hakhmah can only be grasped through the imagery of B inah ( I: I). It is while in a state of Binah consciousness that this information can be described using such imagery as angels and the Throne of Glory. The Sefer Yetzirah also implies that the physical world came into being through Chakhmah, while the spiritual world has its roots in Binah. This is because Chakhmah, the concept of giving fr eely, is the root of mercy. while Binah, the concept of restraint, is the root of justice. Since evil exists in the physical world, if can only be sustained through God's mercy. as the Psalmist sang, \"I have said, the world is built on mercy\" (Psalms 89:3).

This provides one reason why the letters Yud Heh Vav (1:-1') were chosen. As the Sefer Yetzirah will later explain (2:3), in alphabetical order. the first three phonetic families are: Gutturals: Labials: Palatals: Alef Heh C het Eyin Bet Vav Mem Peh Gimel Yud Kaf Kuf It is immediately obvious that the first letters on these groups are the first three letters of the alphabet. Of these, Alef is one of the three Mothers, while Bet and Gimel are among the Doubles. In these three groups, therefore, the first simple letters are Heh, Vav and Yud. These are the letters of the Tetragrammaton. The primary ordering of these letters is Yud Heh Vav. According to the book Razie/, this is because Yud includes the first four letters of the alphabet. Yud has a numerical value of I 0, and this is the sum of the first four letters (I + 2 + 3 + 4 = I 0). After 4 comes 5, the numerical value of Heh, and then 6, the numerical value of Vav.228 Further significance of these letters is discussed above (I: I). In the mystery of the three Mothers The three letters of the Divine Name, Yud Heh Vav (1:1'), parallel the three Mothers, Alef Mem Shin (�r.JII(). See Table 12. As the Sefer Yetzirah later explains (3:4), Mem is water, Shin is fire, while Alef is breath-air. However, we also know that Yud repre­sents Chakhmah, which is the archetype of water, and Heh represents Binah, which is fire. We therefore have a relationship between Yud and Mem, as well as between H eh and Shin. Vav has numerical value of 6, and therefore represents the six basic spacial directions.229 It also represents the six Sefirot: Chesed, Gcvurah, Tiferet, Netzach, Hod, and Yesod.

Vav is t herefore derived from Alef. As we shall see, the three Mothers (Alef Mem Shin) represent thesis, antithesis and synthesis. the basic triad of Sefer Yetzirah (3: I). Here the text explains how a three-dimensional space is produced from these three concepts. Thesis and antithesis represent two opposite directions in a one dimensional line. Together with synthesis, they yield three elements. Since these three elements can be permuted in six different ways, they define a three-dimensional space having six directions.�30 He sealed \"above ' .' ..

These species are waved in all six directions, and according to the Ari, the appropriate letter combina­tion must be meditated upon for each direction. 231 Each of these direc­tions is also paired with its appropriate Sefirah.

See Table 14. To determine the order for the opposite direction, the Ari then makes use of a system used by the Sefer Yetzirah itself. (2:4). The text states that the two prime opposites are Oneg (ANG lJV) meaning \"delight,\" and Nega (NGA VlJ), meaning a \"plague.\" In forming an opposite, it takes the first letter and places it at the end. This is pre­cisely what is done to produce Gevurah (Strength), which represents the north. The Yud (•), which was at the beginning, is now placed at the end. producing the combination HVY (•1:1). The north south axis is then rercsented by the two letters HV (1:1). The up down axis is similarly defined by the letters YV ( 1•), with the position of the H (;,) determining the direction. In this system, the first letter is also significant. For south and up, the initial letter is Y (•), while for north and down, it is H (•). Both of these are opposites in the three column representation. The east west axis is on the neutral zero point on both the up down line and on the north south line. In the three column represen­tation, Tiferet (east) and Yesod (west) are both in the middle line. Since both the middle line and the letter V (1) represent synthesis, the representation of both these directions begins with a Vav.232 See fig­ure 12. The system of the Zohar is exactly the same as that of the Ari, except that east and west are interchanged. The system of the Tikuney Zohar uses a similar principle, but somewhat differently. Later we shall see that the twelve possible permutations of YHVH represent the twelve diagonal boundaries (5:2). Each of the six basic directions can include two of the diagonal boundaries. The first of these is represented by the second Heh at the end of the trip­let, and the second, with this Heh at the beginning. We can now understand the conceptual nature of the Sefirot. The most primary relationship possible is that which exists between Cre­ator and creation. This is the cause effect relationship. Cause is Keter, while Effect is Malkhut. Once the concepts of Cause and Effect exist, another concept comes into being, namely that of opposites. If opposites exist, simi­larities must also exist. Two new concepts therefore come into being. These are Similar­ity and Oppositeness. In the language of philosophy these are thesis and antithesis.

Oppositeness is Binah. These are the Yud and initial Heh of the Tetragrammaton. Once Similarity and Opposition exist, another concept comes into being, namely Relationship. In philosophic terms, this is the syn­thesis between thesis and antithesis. In our present terminology , this is the Vav of the Tetragrammaton. The word \"Vav\" means a hook, and the letter Vav as a prefix means \"and.\" In both senses, it denotes connection and relationship. At this point in the logical sequence, we have five concepts: Cause and Effect, Similarity and Opposition, and Relationship. These. respectively are Keter and Malkhut, Chakhmah and Binah, and the Vav.233 Until the concept of Relationship was introduced, only four abstract points existed: Keter and Malkhut, and Chakhmah and Binah. It is with the concept of Relationship that a three-dimensional conceptual continuum comes into existence. This defines six direc­tions, and hence, the numerical value of Vav is 6. Each of the four abstract concepts then gives rise to a relation­ship. Chakhmah gives rise to Chesed (Love), Binah gives rise to Gevurah (Strength). Keter gives rise to Tiferet (Beauty), and Malkut gives rise to Yesod (Foundation). As discussed earlier, in a spiritual sense, Similarity is closeness, while Opposition is distance. In order to give, the giver must be close to the recipient. In a spiritual sense, there must be an element of simi­larity between giver and recipient. There fore. Chakhmah. which is Similarity, gives rise to Chesed, which is the concept of giving. Conversely, Binah, which is Opposi­tion, gives rise to Gevurah, the concept of witholding."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"( 'haptcr One 8 7 Tiferet is similarly derived fr om Keter, the concept of Cause. In order to have the relationship of Cause, an element must give the precise amount of existence or motivation required for the effect. This is the concept of measured giving, represented by Tiferet. Tiferet is beauty, the golden mean. Since Tiferet is derived fr om Keter, it would be expected to be above Chesed and Gevurah. However, since Tiferet is also the synthesis between Chesed and Gevurah, it is usually re presented as being below them. Malkhut, the concept of Effect, is usually said to be the feminine archetype of creation. Since Yesod is derived from Malkhut, Yesod is naturally drawn to it and motivated to attach itself to it. It is for this reason that Yesod is said to parallel the sexual organ. It is called Yesod (Foundation) because it is the lowest of the six. Derived fr om the original four, there are now four new concepts: Chesed, Gevurah, Tiferet and Yesod. Once the concept of Relationship has been introduced, these four concepts are no longer merely abstract points in conceptual space. They are connected by the concept of Relationship. The two pairs, Chesed-Gevurah and Tiferet-Yesod are like two crossing lines. This yields four directions in a two-dimensional continuum. These two dimensions can be represented in physical space. The Tiferet-Yesod axis can represent east-west, while the Chesed­Gevurah axis can represent south-north. This then yields a two­dimensional cont inuum. Since the concept of Relationship exists, the relationship between the two dimensions themselves is also significant. In the conceptual space depiction, this would be represented as a line drawn between the two existing lines. The Cause-Effect or Keter-Malkhut relationship is that which is primary. This is represented by the Tiferet-Yesod axis. The thesis­antithesis relationship was introduced only to make the cause-effect relationship possible. The thesis-antithesis or Chakhmah-Binah rela­tionship is therefore secondary. This is represented by the Chesed­Gevurah axis. The Tiferet-Yesod axis is therefore the primary dimension, while the Chesed-Gevurah axis is the secondary dimension. This yields a totally new concept, namely the quality of being primary or secon­dary. These. in turn, form a new, third dimension, which can be related to the up down direction. This is the axis linking Netzach (Victory) and Hod (Splendor). See Figure 13. With the introduction of these two concepts, the six Sefirot rep­resented by the Vav are complete. These are Chesed, Gevurah, Tiferet, Netzach, Hod and Y esod. These six Sefirot represent the six directions in space.

Aside fr om their theoretical implications, the Ten Sefirot also have important mystical and meditative significance. The Sefer Yetzirah, in this first chapter, has presented a system of meditating on the Sefirot and of binding oneself to them. One may use the letters to climb the Tree of Life, but the Sefirot are the points where one must rest. There is actually an important apparent contradiction in the text. In one section (I :6 ), the text says . \"Their vision is like the appearance of lightning ... they speak of them 'running and returning.\"' This would imply that it is impossible to see the Sefirot for more than an instant, just like a flash of lightning. Later, however, the text states, '' If your heart runs, return to the place. as it is written, 'The Chayot running and returning'\" (I :8). This appears to say that one can go furt her, but that one should refrain fr om doing so. 2 34 What the text is actually doing, however, is describing two dis­tinct stages of initiation into the mysteries of the Sefirot. The first stage begins with the exercise where the initiate must ''understand with Wisdom. and be wise with Understanding\" (I :4). Here he learns how to oscillate between Binah consciousness and Chakhmah consciousness. On this level, he can meditate on the Sefirot as ten depths. allowing the mind to reach out to the infinity of each of these depths. Since he is still in a state of oscillating men­tality, he sees the Sefirot like flashes of lightning, \" running and returning. \" The ten infinite directions, however, represent a state of separa­tion and disunity. This is the essence of Binah. The initiate must"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Chapter One 89 therefore \"imbed their end in their beginning\" (l :7). He must con­template the point at infinity, where all these opposing directions come together as one. This, however, is something that cannot be accomplished with Binah consciousness. This state of consciousness can only imagine things ver­bally, or depict things in physical terms. The point at infinity is both infi­nite and infintesimal, and therefore, cannot be depicted. It can only be contemplated with Chakhmah consciousness. As the text notes, this represents the unity that preceded the con­cept of number. It introduces a device very much like a Zen koan, asking, \" Before one, what do you count\"? What is the number that precedes all number? Both the point at infinity and the koan are meant to train the mind to visualize absolute nothingness. The Ari notes that Keter, the highest of the Sefirot, is often designated by the word Ayin, meaning \"nothing.\" The Infinite Being, the level above Keter, cannot even be designated by this word. The only word that can be used is Effes, which, according to the Ari, denotes a nothi ngness that thought (Binah) cannot grasp at all. It has been said that the best way to describe absolute nothing­ness is to speak of it as \"what you see behind your head.\" Since vision does not exist in the back of the head, what one sees there is absolute nothingness. If I ask you what you see behind your head, you answer that you see nothing. Contemplating on what one sees behind one's head is therefore a good way to learn how to visualize absolute nothingness. In general, the soul is said to consist of five parts: Nefesh, Ruach, Neshamah, Chayah and Yechidah. Of these, only the first three, Nefesh, Ruach and Neshamah, have any effect on the mind. The last two, Chayah and Yechidah, are called \"envelopments\" (makifin), which cannot enter the mind.m Neshamah, the highest part of the soul that \"enters \" the mind, parallels the Sefirah of Binah. See Table 15 on page 90. Chakhmah consciousness is above thought, and is like something that exists out­side the mind. Or, as in the analogy used earlier, it is like what we \"see\" behind our heads. Just like something behind the head can only be seen if reflected in a mirror, so Chakhmah consciousness can only be grasped when reflected and clothed in Binah. With relation to con­scious thought, Chakhmah consciousness is called \"nothingness. \"236 It is in this context that the text says, \"Bridle your mouth fr om speaking and your heart fr om thinking.\" \"Heart\" denotes Binah con­sciousness, and hence, it is saying that on this level, the initiate must blank out Binah consciousness completely. This is accomplished by"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"90 SEFER YETZIRAH Tahlc 15. Levels of the soul.

He must maintain this level, and is accordingly instructed, \"If your h eart runs\" back to Binah, \"return to the place.\" This \"place\" is Chakhmah consciousness, which the initi­ate has already attained. Once the initiate has reached a point where he can maintain a state of Chakhmah consciousnes. he is ready to actually begin climbing t he Tree of L ife, which is the ladder of the Sefirot. Hebrew is written without vowels, and therefore, the third per­son and the imperative are written exactly the same. We have trans­lated the last paragraph, \"He sealed nort h and faced to the left, and He sealed it with VHY.\" This, however, can also be read in t he imperative: \"Seal north, face to the left. and seal it with VHY.\" In a similar manner, the expression, \"He engraved it and He carved it.\" can also be read in the imperative, \"Engrave it and carve it.\" If understood in this manner, sections I :9-13 can be read as instructions rather than as a theory of creation. (In Appendix I, I have translated the Short Version completely in the imperative, to demonstrate how it reads.) The supposition that this is describing a technique is supported by the last section of the Sefer Yetzirah itself, which says of Abraham, \"He bound t he 221etters of the Torah in his tongue ... He drew them in water. kindled them with fire, agitated them wit h breath\" (6:7). The initiate begins by meditating on Keter, the initial \"Breath of the Living God.\" T his Bre ath must be brought down to the level of Yesod (Foundation). In doing this, h e must contemplate the essence of \"Voice. Breath and Speech.\" Ordinary thought is verbal, and hence, consists of words. These words consist of letters. These are not physical letters, but mental, conceptual letters. These conceptual letters, however, are built out of \"Voice. Breath . Speech.\" Hence, in meditating on these concepts, one is actually contemplating the very roots of t hought. In the Long Version. the text concludes, \"Speech is Ruach llaKodesh (Divine Inspiration).\" Ruach HaKodesh, h owever, is above thought. Hence. t he \" speech\" which the text is speaking of, is a \"speech\" that precedes thought."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Chapter One 91 The second step is \"Breath fr om Breath.\" The text states, \"with it engrave and carve 22 letters.\" The Kabbalists explain that \"engraving\" and \"carving\" denote meditative techniques. This is sup­ported by the last section (6:7), which states that Abraham \"looked, saw. understood. probed, engraved, and carved, and was successful in creation.\" They teach that \"engraving\" denotes a process where one depicts a letter in one's mind. \"Carving\" then means that this letter is sepa­rated fr om all other thoughts, so that the entire mind is filled with it. �37 One may do this by contemplating a letter or letter combination until all other images and thoughts are banished from the mind. Alternatively, this may be accomplished by chanting a letter in a manner that shall presently be described. This is the stage of Malkhut, where one stands at the bottom of the Tree of Life. It is at this stage that the initiate must work with the letter that he wishes to use. He must then \" draw it in water, and kindle it with fi re\" ( 6: 7). The subsequent instructions therefore indi­cate how the letter is to be charged with spiritual power. The third step, then, is \"Water fr om Breath.\" At first, the initiate depicts the letter in transparent air, visuali z ing it clearly. Now he must reach up to the level of Chakhmah, returning to a state of Chakhmah consciousness. He then begins to see the letter as if he were looking at it through water. This is \"drawing it through water.\" The letter begins to blur and fade, as if it were being viewed through increasingly deep water. The initiate must then \"engrave and carve chaos and void, mire and clay.\" At this stage, the form breaks up and dissolves completely, like something seen through turbulent water. This is \"chaos and void.\"�JH The image then fa des away completely, as if it were being viewed through muddy water. This is \"mire.\" Finally, all that is left is inky blackness. as if one were buried in totally opaque mud and clay. The text describes this process saying, \"Engrave them like a gar­den, carve them like a wall, cover (or surround) them like a ceiling.\" First visualize this blackness beneath your feet. Your feet may then appear to dissolve, a phenomenon that is also mentioned in other ancient mystical texts.239 Slowly, make this blackness creep over you, surrounding you completely like a wall. Finally, let it cover and sur­round you like a ceiling of inky black mire. At this point, you will have no visual sensation whatever, neither physical nor mental. All through this process, you are constantly aware of the fe eling of water, cool and absolutely calm. It is the dark, wet feeling of the womb, where you are totally isolated fr om all sensation. It is with respect to this state that the Midrash states, \" Water conceived and gave birth to absolute darkness (afelah).\"240 This is the level of Chakhmah consciousness."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"92 SEFER YETZIRAH Figure 14. The letters Yud H eh Vav in A shu rite script. The initiate then reaches the fourth step, where he returns to a state of Binah consciousness. This is depicted as fire and blinding light, as the Midrash continues, \"Fire conceived and gave birth to Light.\" This is the stage where one \"kindles them with fire.\" Here, the initiate must \"engrave and carve out the Throne of Glory, Serafim, Ophanim, and holy Chayot.\" He depicts (engraves) and fills the mind (carves) with these images, these being the same as the one's visualized by the prophets.24 1 He must start with the Throne, and then continue through the various levels of angels, ending with the Chayot in the Universe of Y etzirah, which corresponds to the Six Directions. The influx is thus brought to the level of Binah. Now the initiate must bring it to the other six Sefirot-Chesed, Gevurah, Tiferet, Netzach, Hod, and Yesod. These are associated with the six directions of the physical world, which have their coun­terpart in the six days of creation. By associating the Sefirot with the six physical directions, one actually brings the influx into the physical domain. The method of drawing the influx into these lower Sefirot involves contemplating the three letters Yud Heh Vav (171'). These should be visualized as if written in the Ashurite script, with black fire on white fire. See figure 14. These letters should appear huge, filling the entire mind. 242 The idea of black fire is not just the absence of light, but negative light. 243 The black must be so intense that it is brilliantly black, just as a light is brilliantly white. This is the black fire with which the letters must be depicted. While contemplat ing the letter combinations, one should face in the appropriate direction, either physically or mentally. After com­pleting all six directions and permutations, t his part of the exercise is complete. What still remains are the astrological applications of this tech­nique, which will be described in chapters 4 an d 5.

The center column, headed by Keter, is represented by Aelf. As discussed earlier, Chakhmah is water (which is here repre­sented by Mem), Binah is fire (which is Shin), and Keter is breath-air (which is the Alef). A pan of merit The Hebrew word for \"pan\" h ere is Ka.f This word can denote the pan of a scale, but it also denotes the palm of t h e hand. Likewise, the word Lashon can be used for the tongue of a balance, the pointer which indicates when the two pans are in equilibrium. Its usual meaning, however, is the tongue that is in the mouth.1 Therefore, on one hand, the letters Alef Mem Shin (171::11'() repre­sent the two pans and tongue of a balance. On the other hand, they represent the two hands, and the \"covenant between them\" (1:3), which is the tongue. The tongue of decree The Hebrew word for \"decree\" here is Chok (pn). This comes fr om the root Chakak (ppn), meaning to \" engrave.\" It is the \" tongue of balance\" that \"engraves\" the letters. This is represented by the let­ter Alef (N), the basis of the alphabet. In the most elemental terms, Mem, Shin and Alef represent the­sis. antithesis, and synthesis. The analogy is that of a scale. (See figure 15.) There is a pan of merit and a pan of liability. This is very much like the scale used to weigh one's merits and sins, which is mentioned in the Talmud. 2 In the center is the fulcrum and pointer, both repre­sented by the Alef, which is the \"tongue of decree.\" K Figure I 5.

If one wishes to create a situation in which he himself or another person is to be brought to the side of merit, one does so by making use of the letter Mem (o). 3 The techniques shall be discussed later. Similarly, if one wishes to bring an enemy to the side of liability, so that he should be judged harshly on high, one makes use of the letter Shin (�). Alef (//() is used to bring a person to be judged fairly and evenly. These qualities also come into play in popular usage. Humming, which involves pronouncing the letter Mem, is usually seen as a happy, pleasant, positive activity. Conversely, one hisses at a villain or enemy, pronouncing the letter Shin. Mem hums, Shin hisses The Hebrew word for \"hum\" here is Damam (co,), in which the letter Mem is dominant. Similarly, the word for \"hiss\" is Sharak {p,�), which begins with a Shin.4 The humming sound associated with Mem is very calm, and it is thus, the sound associated with water and Chakhmah conscious­ness. If one wishes to attain Chakhmah consciousness, one repeats this sound in the manner described like the Kabbalists. The resem­blance between this and the \"Om\" chant is certainly more than coincidental. This sound is also closely associated with prophecy, which involves C hakhmah consciousness. The Kabbalists say that the \"fine still (damamah) voice\" (I Kings 19: 12), heard by Elijah, was actually a \"fine humming sound. \"5 This humming sound is used to attain such a state of consciousness, and as such, it is experienced when one is in a prophetic state. Just as telling is a passage in Job, which, incidentally, also describes the prophetic experience very graphically (Job 4: 12-16): A word was stolen to me My ear caught a touch of it In meditations fr om night visions When a trance fa lls on man Terror called me and I shuddered It terrorized most of my bones A spirit passed before my fa ce Made the hair of my flesh stand on end It stood and I did not recogni ze its vision A picture was before my eyes I heard a hum (damamah) and a v oice."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"98 SEFER YETZIRAH Tahlc 16.

This sound is associ­ated with fire and Binah consciousness. The two sounds. M and Sh. may also be used as a device for oscillating between Binah and Chakhmah consciousness. One invokes a strong state of Binah consciousness by pronouncing the Shin. and then swings to Chakhmah consciousness by voicing the Mem. The pronunciation of these two letters can also include the five primary vowels. in a manner t hat will be described below (2:5) in greater detail. It is significant to note that these two sounds are dominant in the word Chashmal (t,r.:�·tcm). which. according to the Kabbalists, is the interface between the physical and the spiritual. In his vision, Ezekiel thus says that he saw. \"The appearance of Chashmal in the midst of the fire\" ( Ezekiel I :4). It was only after visualizing the Chashmal that Ezekiel was able to perceive the Chayot and enter i nto the state of prophecy. In our present t erminology. Chashmal would be the inter­fa ce between Binah consciousness and Chakhmah consciousness. It therefore appears out of the \"midst o f the fire.\" since it arises from a state o f Binah consciousness. Since M and Sh are the dominant consonents in Chashmah, it is possible that the word itself was used as a mantra when the prophet swung between Binah and Chakhmah consciousness. \" The appear­ance of Chashmal\" would then be the visual experience that one would have during such a state of oscillation. Even the more advanced prophets. who could enter a state of chakhmah conscious­ness at will. would use the term Chashmal to describe this interface.\" According to the Talmud. the word Chashmal comes fr om two words. Chash. meaning \"silence.\" and Mal, indicating speech. It can therefore be translated as \" speaking silence. \"7 It is a double sensation, where one i s experiencing the \"silence\" of Chakhmah consciousness, and the \"speech\" of Binah consciousness at the same time.

The world will take on a surrealistic, almost spiritual, appearance . The interface between Chakhmah and Binah is even more etherial. The Kabbalists also note that t he two letters Shin and Mem spell out Shem (c'tt'), the word for \"name.\"8 It is through the \"names\" of objects, and in particular, through divine Names, that one can make the transition between Chakhmah and Binah consciousness. As the Baal Shem Tov taught, it is through a name that one can grasp the spiritual essence of a person or object.9 The Zohar also says that the letters Mem and Shin define the mystery of Moses, whose Hebrew name, Mosheh, is spelled Mem Shin Heh (:-t'tt'O). 10 This would be an allusion to t he fact that the two consonants, Mem and Shin, represent Chakhmah and Binah. The Heh has a numerical value of 5, and this would represent the five primary vowels, with which the combination of consonants is pro­nounced. See Table 16. A somewhat similar idea is taught explictly by the early Kabbalists. The Torah states that Moses killed an Egyptian who was striking an Israelite, and the Midrash explains that this was accom­plished with a divine Name.11 When he struck the Egyptian, the Torah reports that Moses \"looked here (koh) and there (koh)\" (Exo­dus 2: 12). In Hebrew, both \" here\" and \"there\" are Koh (:-t.:l), a word which has a numerical value of 25. The Kabbalists say that this repre­sents the twenty-five combinations between two letters that are possi­ble with the five primary vowels.12 See figure 16.

However, one can also control one' s breathing, and it is then in the domain of Binah consciousness.

Thus, the Kabbalists make use of controlled breathing in association with such techniques as pronouncing two consonants with the five primary vowels.13 In particular, such a breath comes between the pronuncia­tion of the Mem and the Shin. 2:2 j!l1Y pYn ii'i'n 110' n1'.n1N C'nW1 C'1WV �:l nN1 11:lr';\"l �:l nN C;-T.J 1:lr1 j1'r.J;\"T1 j�j?TC' :11Y� 1'nv;, Twenty-two Foundation letters: He engraved them, He carved them, He permuted them, He weighed them, He trans formed them, And with them, He depicted all that was formed and all that would be fo rmed.

The most obvious reason for the five phonetic families would be so that the divisions of the alphabet should parallel the divisions in the five dimensional continuum defined by Sefer Yetzirah. Indeed, the Kabbalists teach that these five groups parallel the Five Loves and Five Strengths (see 1:3 ), which are the end points ofthese dimen­sions.22 The assignment of these families to specific dimensions, how­ever, is not indicated, although it may be derived indirectly. It is significant to note that all five families are present in Bereshit (n•WI-(1J), the first word of the Torah.23 One of the mysteries of the Sefer Yetzirah is the fact that the double letters are not mentioned. These double letters are the ones which have different forms in the middle and at the end of a word: Mem (co), Nun (p), Tzadi (t'Y), Peh ('1!)), and Kaf (T'). As the Talmud states, the forms of these letters were forgotten, and later re-instituted by the prophets.24 There is absolutely no reference to these doubles in Sefer Y etzirah. The Kabbalists, however, draw a parallel between the five pho­netic families and the five doubled letters. According to the Ari, the letters paralleling the phonetic families in the order presented here are: Tzadi, Nun, Kaf, Mem, Peh. 25 See Table 20 on page I 04. Another concept that is conspicuously missing in the Sefer Yetzirah is that of the vowels. Here again, they form a group of five, the main vowels being Cholam (o), Kametz (a), Tzereh (e), Chirik (i), and Shurek (u). See Table 21 on page 104. These are often alluded to in the mnemonic Pituchey Chotam (cnn •nn!)), the \"signet engrav­ing\" (Exodus 28: II) of the Bible.26 A��ther mnemonic is Table I X. Phonetic division of the alphabet.

Nutareyikon (lii''�92)_27 Although there are other vowels in Hebrew, these five are considered to be the root vowels, both by the grammatarians and by the Kabbalists. The Zohar clearly draws a parallel between the five phonetic families and the five prime vowels, and this is echoed by oth er Kabbalists.28 The five primary vowels would then also represent the five dimensions of the Sefer Yetzirah. In general, the five vowels are very important in the use of the Sefer Yetzirah. The usual procedure is to take a pair of letters, pro­nouncing them with the twenty-five possible combinations of the five vowels. This appears in the system of Rabbi Abraham Abulafia, as well in various techniques of making a Golem. There appear, how­ever, to be a number of different opinions as to the ordering of the vowels, and a few of these are presented in Table 22.29 Some of the later Kabbalists also assign the five phonetic fami­lies to the five Sefirot: Chesed, Gevurah, Tiferet, Netzach a nd Hod. Yesod is not included, since, in this respect, Yesod and Tiferet are counted as one. 3° Furthermore, Yesod pertains to melody rather than to sound.31 There is, however, a difference of opinion between the Ari and the Ramak as to whether the Sefirot are to be taken in descending or in ascending order.32 The five main vowels are also assigned to these same Sefirot.33 See Table 23. The first clue as to how to assign these to the five-dimensional con­tinuum comes fr om the ordering of the final letters in the Talmud: Mem Nun Tzadi Pen Kaf (1DY.lr.:l). In all sources, both Talmudic and Kabbalistic, the letters are presented in this order. The correct alphabeti­cal order of the letters, however, would be: Kaf Mem Nun Peh Tzadi (rD.lr.:l::l). See Table 24 on page 1 06. The question then arises: why are these letters usually not presented in their alphabetical order?34 Earlier (I :3), however, we have spoken of the division of the Ten Sefirot into two groups representing the two hands. These are the Five Loves and the Five 1 udgments. In the order of the Sefirot, they are: Five Loves: Keter, Chakhmah, Chesed, Tiferet, Netzach. Five Judgments: Binah, Gevurah, Hod, Yesod, Malkhut."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"106 SEFER YETZIRAH It is immediately obvious that each group represents a set of end points in the five-dimensional continuum.

When they relate to the Five Loves, they arc in direct alphabetical order.35 Sec Table 25. Since each of the final letters represents one ofthe phonetic fam­ilies, these can a lso be assigned to their appropriate dimension. In relating the five primary vowels to these phonetic families, the Zohar presents them in the order i u e o a, this being the order that they appear in PiTuCheY ChoTaM (o.nn •n.n!J).36 Since the Zohar here presents the phonetic families in alphab�ti�al order, a parallel can immediately be drawn: Gutturals Labials Palatals Linguals Dentals :n\"l7ol u e 0 a Chirik Shurek Tzereh Cholam Kametz We now have three groups of five: the phonetic families, the final letters, and the primary vowels.

The text then says, \"Engrave them with voice. carve them with breath, and set them in the mouth in five places.\" The instruction is to carefully pronounce each letter of these five families. This is \"engrave them with voice.\" Then one must \"carve them with breath,\" contemplating each letter carefully, and concen­trating on the breath that is exhaled while it is pronounced. Finally, one must \"set them in the mouth,\" meditating on the place in the mouth with which the letter is pronounced. In this exercise, each family may also be pronounced with its appropriate vowel. This yields a chant that can be used for this exer­cise. See Table 26 on page I 08. The purpose of this exercise is to make the initiate highly aware of the physical processes involved in pronouncing the letters. While speech itself involves Binah consciousness, the pronunciation of the letters is an automatic activity, and hence, it involves Chakhmah consciOusness.

In a circle The word for \"circle\" here is Galgal. This can also be translated as \"sphere\" or \"cycle.\" Later, the Sefer Yetzirah speaks of the Galgal again, saying, \"The cycle (galga[) in the year is like a king in the pro­vence\" (6:3)."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Chapter Jh·o 109 The first chapter spoke of the 32 paths of Wisdom. As discussed there ( 1: 1 ), the number 32, when written out, spells Lev, meaning \"heart.\" The text later speaks of the mystical experience by saying, \"If your heart runs\" (I :8). It also warns, \"Bridle your. .. heart fr om thinking\" (I :8). The first chapter thus speaks of one aspect of k ingship, which is the heart. As the text later says, \"The heart in the soul is l ike a king in war\" (6:3). The heart therefore dominates the continuum of the spiritual. Now, in the second chapter, the text is turning to a second aspect of kingship, the Cycle (galga[), which dominates time. In general, if a number of points are placed in a circle, the num­ber of possible lines that can connect any pair of points can be easily calculated. If we l et n be the number of points, and L the number of lines. the formula is: L = n (n-I )/2 Take the number, multiply it by the number below it, and divide by two. Thus, three points in a circle can be joined by three lines, four points by six lines, five points by ten lines, and six points by fifteen lines. See figure 17 on page 1 10. A given number of points can always be joined by the number of lines provided by the above formula. The number of lines that can connect the 22 letters placed in a circle is therefore (22 x 21 )/2. See figure 18 on page Ill. Making the calculation, we find that there are 231 such lines. These are the 231 Gates. Like a wall ... This can also be read in the imperative: \"Place them in a circle, like a wall with 231 gates.\" The Kabbalists present an important meditation regarding these gatesY This is based on a text in the first chapter: \"Engrave them like a garden, carve them like a wall, deck them like a ceiling\" (I: II). The initiate must contemplate the ground, visualizing it as murky black mud. He must then \"engrave\" the 22 letters, forming each one in his mind. These should make a circle in the ground. Then he must \" carve them like a wall.\" He must \"carve\" each letter out of the ground and stand each one up, making a circle of letters, surrounding him like a wall. One of the major Kabbalists, Rabbi Isaac of Acco, speaks of a similar meditation, where the letters are visualized on the horizon.3 8"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"110 3 Points 3 Lines 5 Points I 0 Lines 7 Points 21 Lines SEFER YETZIRAH Figure 17.

Focusing the mind on the Alef, he then follows each of the 21 paths emanating from it to the other let­ters. fr om Bet to Tav. He continues in this manner, using all the other letters. See figure I 9 on page Ill. According to some, this is also a technique for making a Golem. If one wishes to destroy it, one proceeds in the precise opposite direc­tion. beginning with Tav, and ending with Aleph. Some commentaries present a more primitive method, where the initiate actually draws a circle around the object that he wishes to form. 19 Proceeding in a circle, he chants the letter combinations, first Alef with all the other letters, then Bet, until the alphabet is com­pleted. If one wishes to destroy the creation, he proceeds in the oppo­site direction. It i s also related that the disciples of the Riva40 attempted to use the Sefer Y etzirah to make a creature. They went in the wrong direction, however, and sunk in the earth up to their waists through the power of the letters. Trapped, they cried out for help. The Riva was finally con­tacted, and he told his other disciples to recite the alphabets while pro­ceeding in the opposite direction, until the others were freed. 41 There is some question as to whether \"proceeding\" here means that one should actually walk a round the circle, or whether it means that one must merel y move around it m entally and meditatively. With 231 Gates The number 231 represents the number of ways in which two different letters of the Hebrew alphabet can be connected. This num­ber also is the number of two letter words that can be formed with the letters, provided the same letter is not repeated, and provided that order is not considered. These combinations may be arranged in a triangle. 42 This first method is called the Logical Method (figure 20). B esides this, there is also a Kabbalistic Method (figure 21 ) , which is somewhat more complex.43 In the Kabbalistic Method, one begins by writing the entire Hebrew alphabet, fr om Alef to Tav. On the second line, one writes every other letter, ending with Shin. One then skips the Tav and begins once again with Alef.

Since 22 is divisible by eleven, the two letters, Alef and Lamed, repeat themselves for the entire line."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"( 'haprer Jim 115 The next step is to take the array and break it into pairs. This yields 21 lines and II columns, producing a total of 231 pairs. These are the 231 Gates according to the Kabbalistic Method. See figure 22. This system is actually not as complex as it first appears. To understand it more thoroughly, we can take a similar array, using the numbers from 0 to 9 instead of letters. It is quite simple to make such an array. See figure 23. In the first line, one merely counts fr om 0 to 9. In the second line, one counts by two. As soon as we reach 10, we merely use the last digit. In the third line, we do the same, counting by three and using only the final digit. The rest of the array is formed using subsequent numbers. What we actually have then is a simple multiplication table, where only the last digits have been retained. Clearly obvious in this array is the diagonal symmetry, which is also found in the alphabeti­cal array. The fifth line is particularly significant. When one counts by 5, one obtains the numbers 5, I 0, 15, 25, and so on. Therefore, when only the last digits are taken, 5 and 0 alternate on this line. The same is true of the eleventh line in the alphabetica l array, w here the Alef and the Lamed alternate. One then divides the array into double columns, to form a numerical analogue of the 231 Gates. The only difference is that when working with the alphabet, we are, in effect, using a number base of 22. See figure 24 on page 116 . One thing that is immediately apparent is the fact that even though we obtain 45 pairs, they do not correspond exactl y to the 45 unique pairs that can be obtained fr om I 0 digits. See figure 25 on page I 16. We actually find that 14 pairs are missing, while an equal number are repeated. The most glaring example of this is the repeti­tion of the combination 05, which occurs five times. Another redundency is 80, which is merely the reverse of 0 8. Just as one can begin each sequence fr om Alef, so one can also begin it fr om Bet. One would then have a similar array, with each line beginning with a Bet instead of an Alef. Each letter of the Bet array would be one higher than the corresponding letter in the Alef array. One can make similar arrays with all the letters of the alphabet. Very important is the eleventh line, where the letter pairs repeat themselves. In the Alef array, the letters Alef and Lamed repeat them­selves in this line. In the Bet array, the letters Bet and Mem will repeat themselves. As subsequent arrays are constructed, the repeat­ing letters continue to conform to those in the ALBaM (o:J ��)cipher.

In the Lamed array, the letters Alef and Lamed repeat, so that this is the reverse of the Alef array. The repeating let­ters in the subsequent arrays are the reverse of those in the first eleven arrays. Therefore, there are eleven arrays where the eleventh line has the pairs in the ALBaM sequence repeating. The next eleven arrays have their reverse repeating. A number of somewhat similar arrays are used by the later Kabbalists. 44 Instead of using the Kabbalistic Method, however, they merely skip a number of letters in the second column, and then procede with the alphabet in its usual order. It is not clear if these later Kabbalists did this so as to conceal the true method, or if i t actually represents a completely different procedure. See figure 27 on page 118. According to either procedure, there are eleven arrays in which the pairs represented by ALBaM are dominant. Then, there are another eleven arrays where the reverse of these pairs are dominant. The fi rst eleven arrays are said to represent the eleven Sefirot when the quasi-Sefirah Daat ( Knowledge) is also included. The sequence is: Keter, Chakhmah, Binah, Daat, Chesed, Gevurah, Tiferet, Netzach, Hod, Yesod, Malkhut. The first eleven arrays, where the pairs of ALBaM are in direct order, represent the \" fr ont\" of these eleven Sefirot. The second set of eleven, where these pairs are reversed, represent the \"back\" of the Sefirot. These arrays are presented in Appendix III. Although the Sefer Yetzirah says, \"Ten and not eleven\" (1:4), this is only speaking of the inner essence of the Sefirot. When we speak of their representation as letter arrays, we are speaking of their outer essence, and here Daat (Knowledge) is also counted, making eleven.45 These array are very important in binding oneself to the Sefirot. They are also used in the creation of a Golem. According to the early Kabbalists, the 231 Gates are alluded to in the name Israel.46 In Hebrew, Israel is spelled YiSRAeL (?1)(,10'). These letters can also spell out YeSh RLA (�)(?, 10'), which literally means, \"there are 231.\" The Midrash states that at the beginning of creation, \"Israel rose in thought.\" 47 The name \"Israel\" thus alludes to the fact that creation took place through these 231 Gates. According to the later Kabbalists, these 231 gates are what remained in the Vacated Space that preceded creation.4s When the Sefer Yetzirah speaks of the \"32 Paths of Wisdom,\" it uses the word Nativ for \"path.\" The numerical value of Nativ (:I'm)"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"118 SEFER YETZIRAH ' !lit' 1j?

In some versions of Sefer Y etzirah, the actual reading is \"462 Gates. \" 50 There is, however, a very ancient tradition which reads 221 Gates rather than 231.5 1 This is the reading favored by Rabbi Eliezer Rokeach of Wormes, who learned it by tradition fr om Rabbi Yehudah HaChasid.52 See figure 28. The Kabbalists note that this number is based on the Talmudic teaching that in the Future World, King David's cup will hold 221 mea­sures. 53 This is based on the verse, \"You have annointed my head with oil, my cup i s overflowing\" (Psalms 23:5). In Hebrew, \"overflowing\" is Revayah (:1•11), which has a numerical value of 221. The term Revayah is later used by Sefer Yetzirah to denote the \"temperate\" season, paralleling the letter Alef(3:5, 7).

Also significant is the context of this teaching. The beginning of this verse is, \"You have annointed my head with oil.\" This alludes to the feeling of being bathed in oil which is fr equently encountered during the mystical experience.54 Attaining such an experience is therefore associated with these 221 Gates. The number 221 is also significant as being the product of two primes, I 7 and 13. The numbers can therefore be placed in a unique array. This system follows logically from the Kabbalistic Method dis­cussed earlier. In the array produced by this method, the two letters, Alcf and Lamed, arc repeated eleven times. Since this is a single com­bination, such repetition is redundant. In Eliezer Rokeach's system, the Alef-Lamed pair is used only once. Since ten such pairs are omit­ted, instead of 231 Gates, one is left with 221. Similar arrays can be made beginning with the other letters.

In an earlier section (I: 13). we discussed how permutations such as these can result in opposites. A very similar permutation is presented by the Kabbalists. The highest spiritual level to which one can aspire is the Sefirah of Keter (Crown). The furt her one climbs. however, the more rarified the atmosphere, and the greater the spiritual danger. By a simple permu­tation. the word Keter (1m) becomes Karel (m:;,), the Hebrew word for excision. where a person is completely cut off spiritually.5x One of the early 1Oth century mystics, Hai Gaon, noted that many people who embarked on the mysteries were successful, but then met with untimely death. 59 The higher the climb, the more dan­gerous the fall. A person would not attempt to climb a dangerous mountain without the proper training and equipment. Any novice who would attempt a climb without an experienced guide would be courting dis­aster.

Each letter must be permuted with the Tetragramma­ton in an appropriate manner. The technique for doing this is outlined by Rabbi E liezer Rokcach of Wormes, particularly in the context of creating a Golem. 60 This brings us to some of the most powerful meditative techniques of the Sefer Yetzirah. When one is working with a letter, he must combine that letter with the letters of the Tetragrammaton, using all five vowels. Thus, for example, if one were using the Alef, one would begin by combining it with the Yud of the Tetragrammaton, using all five vowels. See figure 36 on page 126. There is, however, some question as to how one is to go about this. From the words of Rabbi Eliezar Rokeach. it would appear that one simply makes use of all the vowels m sequence: AuYuAaYaAiYiAeYeAoYo ·;� ·� ·� ·� ·� '' '' '' TT '' As discussed earlier, there is some question regarding the sequence of the five primary vowels (2:3). There are at least a half dozen different opinions. If the proper sequence is crucial, much dan­gerous experimentation would have to be done to determine the proper sequence. It is possible, however, that the sequence is not overridingly important. In any event, following the system of Rabbi Eliezer Rokeach, the initiate must then proceed in this manner, completing all four letters of the Tetragrammaton. One can proceed in the same manner using any other letter of the alphabet. The initiate continues in this manner, pronouncing all the letters in the array ofthe 221 (or 231) Gates. Since Alef is the letter associated with the thorax, the entire Alef array would pertain to this part of the body. Next the initiate would proceed to the head, for which he would use the Shin array, as explained below (3:9). He would form an array of the 221 Gates where every line begins with a Shin. He would then continue in this manner through all the parts of the body, using the letters that the Sefer Yetzirah associates with each part. For each letter, one must go through the entire sequence of 221 (or 231) Gates. Each such sequence contains 442 letters, and there­fore, in completing all 22 letters of the alphabet, one will have made use of 4862 letters.

An initiate should not do it alone, but should always be accompanied by one or two colleagues. The Golem must be made of virgin soil, taken fr om a place where no man has ever dug. The soil must be kneaded with pure spring water, taken directly fr om the ground. If this water is placed in any kind of vessel, it can no longer be used. The people making the Golem must pur­ify themselves totally before engaging in this activity, both physically and spiritually. While making the Golem, they must wear clean white vestments. These authors also stress that one must not make any mistake or error in the pronunciation. They do not say what must be done if one errs, but fr om other sources, it would appear that at very least, one would have to begin the array fr om the beginning. During this entire procedure, no interruption whatsoever may occur. These authors also intimate that they are only revealing the out­line of the method, and are not presenting it in its entirety. This also appears evident fr om other sources. There is also evidence that creating a Golem was primarily not a physical procedure, but rather, a highly advanced meditative tech­nique. 62 By chanting the appropriate letter arrays together with the letters of the Tetragrammaton, the initiate could form a very real mental image of a human being, limb by limb. This possibly could be used as an astral body, through which one could ascend to the spiritual realms."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"128 SEFER YETZIRAH The formation of such a spiritual body, however, would also result in a tremendous spiritual potential. Once the conceptual Golem was completed, this spiritual potential could be transferred to a clay form and actually animate it. This was the process through which a physical Golem would be brought to life. In introducing this method, the Sefer Yetzirah said, \"Engrave them like a garden, carve them like a wall, deck them like a ceiling\" (I: II) . There is some question as to what role this meditation plays in the technique of making a Golem. According to some early sources. one must procede in a circle around the creature that one is creating. This might refer to the mental structuring of this \"garden,\" \"waiL\" and \"ceiling, \" before the Golem is formed.

If this method were used with an entire array of 221 letter pairs, completing a single array would be a major task, taking over an hour and a half to complete. It would take over 35 hours to complete the entire sequence of 22 letters. It is questionable if this was ever actu­ally done in practice, but it is not impossible. Forming a Golem was considered to b e the most advanced-and dangerous-of all medita­tive techniques. An initiate advanced enough to attempt it might also have the discipline necessary fo r over thirty hours of continuous meditation. Besides this. Abulafia also prescribes specific breathing exercises to be used while chanting these letters. Between each letter one is to take a single breath. Between pairs, one is to take no more than two breaths. between lines. no more than five, and between each letter of the Tetragrammaton. no more than twenty-five. Specific head motions are also prescribed fo r this exercise. These head motions arc to be made slowly and deli berately, while one pro­nounces the letter and exhales. See figure 40. These motions corre­spond to the shape of the vowel. While doing this exercise, one is seated. facing toward the east. There is evidence that the names and shapes of the Hebrew vowel points were used for mystical puposes long before they were used in writing and grammar. The earliest non-mystical use of the vowels dates fr om the eighth or ninth century, while mystical uses arc found in Kabbalistic sources that date as early as the first century. It is highly possible that the shapes of the written vowels were taken from the head motions associated with their sounds. Abulafia uses his system of breathing exercises and head motions with the letter Alef. since Alef (with a numerical value of I) expresses unity with God. The same system can also be used with other letters. There is no evidence. however, that this method was ever used with an entire array of 221 letter pairs. To use it with even a single letter i s a major effort. It is possible, however. that this method could be used with various letters to attain specific results with them. 64 Golem-making was merely the most advanced and spectacular use o f the methods of Sefer Y ctzirah.

The array associated with the particular letter could be used as a meditation to affect that specific limb. This could be used to strengthen the spiritual energy of that limb, or even for curative puposes. The letters are also associated with various times and astrological s igns. Using the system ofSefer Yetzirah one can also construct med­itations associated with these. 2:6 .:JYn1 1.:1't7' l:l'� .11� :1t'V1 1:1.l1r.J t'r.Jr.J 1Y' '� jr.J'O :1n w�m 1J'�t' 1'1�r.J t:J't,nl t:J'11r.JV 11:!1'':1 t,.:1 n� :1WV1 1'r.J7J1 :1�1Y '� c:v ct,1.:11 ct,1.:1 cv t:J' .l1W1 0'1WV 1:11t, jr.J'01 1n� t:JW 11:11:1 t,.:1 .11�1 :1n� �U.:J t:J'Y�n Hcfi:mned substance out q(chaos and made nonexistence into existence He carved great pillars fi\"om air that cannot he grasped.

The \"water\" mentioned there denoted the most primitive spiritual root of"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"132 SEFER YETZIRAH water, as it exists in the universe of Atzilut, the realm of the Sefirot. It was out of this that the first stage of matter, \"Chaos\" (tohu), was formed. The text here therefore states that it was out of this \"chaos\" that matter was formed. The word for \"substance\" here is Mamash (wr.�r.�). This comes fr om the root Mashash (wwr.�), meaning \"to touch.\" What is produced is a reality that can not only be seen, but which is physical enough to be touched. And made nonexistence into existence Chakhmah, however, is on the level of Nothingness. It is from this Nothingness, however, that all things were created. From this \"nonexistence,\" Binah and Beriyah, which are called \"existence\" (Yes h), were brought into being. He carved great pillars The reference here is obviously to the verse, \" Wisdom has built its house, it has carved its seven pillars\" (Proverbs 9: I). This is fur­ther evidence that this section is speaking of Chakhmah (Wisdom).65 There is some discussion at to the meaning of the \"seven pillars\" in this verse. In one place, the Talmud says that they are the seven days of the week.66 Elsewhere, the Talmud states that they refer to the seven pillars upon which the world stands, an interpretation that is also mentioned in the ZoharY Others identify them with the seven sciences: grammar, rhetoric, logic, arithmetic, music, geometry, and astronomy. 68 The Kabbalists teach that these seven pillars represent the lower seven Sefirot.69 These correspond to the seven pillars of creation and the seven days of the week, so this does not contradict the Talmudic interpretation. In the system of the Sefer Yetzirah, it is obvious that these seven pillars represent the seven Doubles. They are called \"pillars\" because they arc represented by vertical lines in the Tree of Life diagram. These seven Doubles are derived fr om the three Mothers. This would support an ancient version, which instead of \"substance\" (Mamash-wr.�r.�), read AMSh (Wr.ll'(), the three Mothers.7c The text would then read, \"He formed AMSh (Wr.ll'() out of chaos ... and carved great pillars .... \""},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Chapter Fwo 133 From air that cannot be grasped These pillars are carved fr om \"air which cannot be grasped.\" Air was earlier identified with Breath, which in tum is associated with the first Sefirah, Keter. Air is also identified with the letter Alef (2: I, 3:4 ). The Sefer Yetzirah states that water is below, fire above, and air is in the middle. This may initially be somewhat difficult to under­stand, since air is associated with Breath and Keter, the highest Sefirah. 7 1 It is also associated with Alef, the first letter of the alphabet. As explained earlier (I :9), however, the Breath associated with Keter is not graspable, since this Sefirah represents a level above the intellect. The only place where this Breath can become manifest is in the lower Sefirot. Therefore, even though it is on a level above Chakhmah and Binah, it is only manifest on a level that is below them. The \" air that cannot be grasped\" is therefore the Breath coming fr om Keter. This cannot be grasped until it enters the realm of the \"pillars,\" that is, the lower seven Sefirot. This section is actually best understood in a mystical sense. The previous section explained how to use the letter arrays t ogether with the divine Name as a meditative device. One of the manifestations of higher meditative states (as well as some drug-induced states) is hallucinogenesis, where one can voluntarily form mental images. These mental images appear to be real and substantial. When a per­son is in a normal state of consciousness, he may be able to form mental images, but they are weak, transcient, and blurred by mental static. In contrast, the images formed in a meditative state appear solid. substantial, and real. In an ordinary state of Binah consciousness, the mind is filled with static. If you wish to see this static, merely close your eyes. You will see a rapidly changing kaleidoscope of images, one imposed on another. Even if you can grasp a single image for a short while, it is intermi ngled with mental static, and you have little control over the image. You cannot make it come and go at will, and you cannot determine how it behaves. Even when you can exert some influence over it, the image will seem to have a mind of its own. This static also exists even when our eyes are open, but it is over­shadowed by the images of the real world. In a darkened room, how­ever, it does remain visible to some degree. This static impairs our perception of the outside world, and clouds our mental processes. The perception of the spiritual world is even more tenuous than that of the physical. In a normal state of consciousness, mental static makes it absolutely impossible to visualize the spiritual world."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"134 SEFER YETZIRAH Here this state of mental static is called \"chaos\" (tohu). As both the Kabbalists and linguists teach, the word 7ohu (1:-t1\"1) comes fr om the verb Ta hah (:-t:-tn), meaning to be \"astounded\" or \"confused. \"72 This is the normal state of mental confusion, where the mind is clouded w ith static. This is also associated with Binah consciousness, and accordingly, a number of Kabbalists associate To hu with Binah.73 The Zohar also teaches that To hu is associated with the K/ipah (Husk). the fo rces that prevent one fr om visualizing the spiritual realm. 74 It is out of this To hu. this state of confused Binah consciousness, that one must create a palpable image. There are many images that can be produced. but the most common is the mental Golem, the astral body. The initiate thus \" forms palpable substance (mamash) out of chaos.\" This implies attaining a state of Chakhmah conscious­ness. The Kabbalists thus note that the word Golem (C�l) has a numerical value of 73. the same as that of Chakhmah (:-to:m).7 5 One must then \"make nonexistence into existence.\" Earlier, in stat­ing, \"form substance out of chaos,\" the text uses the word \"form,\" while here it uses the word \"make.\" In Hebrew, especially according to the Kabbalists. the word \"form\" (yatzar) denotes the initial fo rming of \"something from something.\" The term \"make\" (asah), on the other hand. refers to the completion of the process. Thus, in ')arming substance out of chaos.\" one begins the mental act of creation. In \"making nonexis­tence into existence,\" one completes it. The term \"formation\" also i mplies an activity taking place in Yetzirah. t he lower spiritual universe. Thus, when one \" forms sub­stance out of chaos.\" one is bringing about a purely spiritual result in the universe of Yetzirah. \"Making,\" on the other hand, refers to the universe of Asiyah. which borders on the physical. This implies results that may actually be manifest in the physical world. In order to accomplish this. one must enter fully into the realm of Nothingness. This is the highest level of Chakhmah consciousness, bordering on Keter. One therefore begins with \"nonexistence,\" which is Nothingness. When one reaches this level, he can actually make something \"that actually is\" (yeshno) or \"existence.\" He can actually bring about results in the universe of Asiyah, which can then be reflected in the physical world. In making a Golem, this would correspond to the state of consciousness required before the mental image could be imposed on the clay, bringing it to life. A very similar process is described by the great Hassidic master, Rabbi Dov Baer. the Maggid of Mezritch (I 704-1772). He writes that when a person contemplates a physical object completely and totally, he can actually bring that object onto his thought. If his thought is"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Chapter 1ivo 135 then bound to the supernal Mind, he can elevate that object to the level of Mind. From there, it can be fu rther elevated to the level of Nothingness, where the object ceases to exist. When this object is then once again brought back to the level of Mind, it can be brought back in any form that the initiate desires. Thus, when he finally brings it back to its normal physical state, the object can be changed in any manner he desires. As the Maggid states, \"he can even trans­form it into gold. \"76 It is in this state of consciousness that one can visualize the Sefirot as \"great pillars.\" One \"carves\" them out, this meaning that the image of the Sefirah is seen separately, totally filling the con­sci ousness. Even though t he Sefirot are totally ineffable and inde­scribable, when a person is in this state of consciousness, he can \"carve\" them out. They are then perceived as solid pillars, made of transparent air. Like the air, the Sefirot are still invisible, but in this state of consciousness, even the air can become visible. This is a sign ... The Sefer Yetzirah describes a sign through which one knows that he has attained this state. He must go through the entire array, \"Alef with them all, and all of them with Alef.'' This means that he permutes the array forward and backward, which respectively are the modes of creating and destroying. The initate then \"forsees, transforms and makes.\" The word for \"foresee\" here is tzofeh, and as discussed earlier (I :6), this word denotes mystical insight and foresight. If the initiate has attained the proper state, he attains a mystical insight through which he can per­ceive the inner essence of all things. He can then engage in the proc­ess described earl ier, where the Sefer Yetzirah said, \"discern with them, and probe fr om them\" (I :4). When the initiate reaches this high level, he can also \"transform,\" actually changing physical things. He can even \"make,\" bringing things to existence in the physical world. Most important is the final realization: \"All that is formed and all that is spoken is one N arne.\" The initiate not only knows this intellectually, but he can actually visualize a nd see that all creation is nothing more than one Name, the Tetragrammaton. A sign fo r this thing, 22 objects ... This goes back and refers to the entire chapter. \"Twenty-two objects in a single body,\" is a sign that the initiate has completed this discipline and has mastered it fully."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"136 SEFER YETZIRAH He uses each of the 22 letters to form a mental image of a differ­ent part of the body. Each part of the body can thus be formed sepa­rately. The ability to complete separate parts, however, does not prove mastery of the method of Sefer Yetzirah. The final proof of mastery is the ability to assemble all these 22 objects into a single body.7 7 This is the process of complet ing a mental Golem. The initiate must not only fo rm all the parts, but he must actually assemble them. This means that while he is engaged in the meditation to create one part, he must not lose his mental image of the parts that he formed earlier. As each part of the image is formed, it must be retained in the mind, with subsequent images added to it, part by part. The amount of mental discipline, as well as the advanced nature of the meditative technique required fo r this, is virtually beyond description. The creation of a mental Golem is therefore a culmination of the arts of Sefer Y etzirah, as well as a test to determine if one has mas­tered t hem. This did not involve the actual creation of a physical Golem, since this was only done on very special occasions. As the Kabbalists warn, such an undertaking should not be attempted with­out permission from on high. n"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREE"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Chapter Three 3:1 .rmi rp j110' W\"rJ� nm� W�W :C' .l\"1.:l':l V'1.:m pn j1W�, :1:1m �.::n Three Mothers: Alef Mem Shin (IP�N) Their foundation is a pan of merit a pan of liability and the tongue of decree deciding between them. 139 This repeats part of a previous section (2: I), and it has already been discussed.

It is similar to an ancient tra­dition of homiletic interpretation: \"Two scriptures that contradict one another. until a third scripture comes and decides between them.\" 1 In both cases, the same expression, \"decides between t hem.\" (Makhria Bevnehem). is used. It is significant to note that the homi­letic rule is expressed by Rabbi Ishmael, a leader of an important first century mystical school, who apparently received it fr om Rabbi Nehuniah ben HaKana.2 The simplest interpretation is that Mem is thesis, Shin is antithesis, and Alef is synthesis. These three elements then form the three vertical columns into which the Sefirot are divided. Mem represents the right hand column (headed by Chakhmah), Shin, the left hand column (headed by Binah), and Alef, the central column (headed by Keter).3 There is, however, another interpretation, and this follows the arrangement of the letters on the Tree of Life according to the Ari.4 Here, Alef, Mem and Shin are the horizontal lines, connecting oppos­ing Sefirot. Shin is between Chakhmah and Binah, Alef between Chesed and Gevurah, and Mem between Netzach and Hod."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"140 SEFER YETZIRAH Following this, the text is saying that the \"foundation\" of all three of these Mother letters is the synthesis that connects thesis and antithesis. Thesis is the Sefirah to the right, antithesis is the one to the left, and synthesis is the Mother letter connecting the two. 3:2 ;,o1:�m ��!)m �nl 110 �\"rJ� nm� ��� t:l'rJ 1�1� c;,rJ 1�Y�1 .M1V�tJ ��� mnn1 :!111�1!1 .l11��rJ1 !11�� 11�1J Cl;'\"lrJ1 '0� Three ;\\Jot hers: Alef Mem Shin (vo�) A great, mystical secret covered and sealed with six rings And from them emanated air, water and fi re And from them are born Fathers, and fr om the Fa thers, descendents. A great mystical secret The word for \"mystical\" here is MuPhla (�?!l10). 5 This is very closely related. and shares the same root with the word Peliyah (:-��·L,!l). used in relation to the Thirty-two Paths ofWisdom (1:1). One reason for this. as discussed earlier (2: I), is because it is through t hese Mother letters that one can enter into the realm of Chakhmah con­sciousness, which is the portal to the transcendental. These three Mother letters are also related to the mystery of the divine Name. The Sefer Yetzirah earlier said, \"He chose three let­ters ... in the mystery of the three Mothers, AMSh (vo�)\" (I: 13). Thus. the letters AMSh (vo�) are the roots of the letters of the Tetra­grammaton, YHV (1:1•). According to the Kabbalists, Y ud is derived fr om Mem. Heh from Shin, and Vav fr om Alef.6 These three Mothers therefore represent an even deeper mystery than the Tetrag­rammaton. The Tetragrammaton actually only relates to the Ten Sefirot. There is, however, an aspect of creation that existed before the Sefirot. In this stage, the proto-Sefirot existed as simple non­interacting points. In the language of the Kabbalists, this is known as the Universe of Chaos ( To hu). I n this state, the Vessels, which were"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Chapter Three 141 the proto-Sefirot, could neither interact nor give to one another. Since they could not emulate God by giving, they were incomplete, a n d could therefore not hold the Divine Light. Since they could not fulfill their purpose, they were overwhelmed by the Light and \"shattered.\" This is known as the \"Breaking of Vessels.\" The broken shards of these Vessels fell to a lower spiritual level, and subsequently became the source of all evil. It is for this reason that Chaos ( To hu) is said to be the root of evil. After having been shattered, the Vessels were once again recti­fi ed and rebuilt into Personifications (Partzufim). Each of these Partzufim consists of 613 parts, paralleling the 613 parts of the body, as well as the 613 commandments of the Torah. These Partzufim were then able to interact with each other. More important, through the Torah, they were also able to interact with man. This is the stage where the Sefirot become givers as well as receivers. In this rectified state the Vessels (or Sefirot) became fit to receive God's Light. In Kabbalistic terminology, this state is called the Uni­verse of Rectification (Tikkun). The Kabbalists teach that the letters of the Tetragrammaton, YHV {1:-t'), only pertain to the Universe of Rectification. In the Uni­verse of Chaos (Tohu), the divine Name consisted ofthe letters AMSh (Vr.JI'(). 7 When a person enters into the mysteries, he must parallel the sequence of creation.8 First he enters the Universe of Chaos (Tohu). Here his mind is filled with confused t ransient images. If he perceives the Sefirot, they are \"like lightning, running and returning\" (I :6). The Sefirot are perceived as disconnected images, where no relatio11ship between them can be seen. This is the state of consciousness attained through the letters AMSh (Vr.JI'(), as discussed earlier (2: I). The initiate can then enter the Universe of Rectification, where the Sefirot are connected and assume the form of Partzufim. Each Partzuf is a human-like form, very closely related to the conceptual Golem. The creation of this mental Golem-Partzuf is accomplished through the letters of the name YHVH together with various letters, as described above (2:5). This is the Name associated with the Uni­verse of Rectification. Here, one must combine all the Sefirot to form \" a single body\" (2:6). One also becomes aware of the lines connecting the Sefirot, which are included in t he Thirty-two Paths of Wisdom. Hence, when these T hirty-two Paths are discussed, the Sefer Yetzirah uses the names YH YHVH. The three Mother letters, AMSh also spell out the Hebrew word Emesh (Vr.JI'(), meaning \"yesternight.\" This occurs in the verse, \" You slept last night (emesh) with my father\" (Genesis 19:34). The word"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"142 SEFER YETZIRAH emesh also denotes deep impenetrable gloom, as in the verse, \"Gloom (emesh), waste and desolation\" (Job 30:3).9 This is the inky gloom that existed before creation, in the Universe of Chaos, the \"yesternight\" before the Sefirot were brought into being. There is also evidence that the word emesh was also used as a mystical name of God. Thus, Laban said to Jacob, \" The God of your fathers last night (Emesh) said to me\" (Genesis 31 :29). This can just as easily be read, \"The God of your fathers, Emesh, said to me.\" Sim­ilarly, Jacob sai d, \"And Emesh gave judgment\" (Genesis 31 :43).10 Accord ing to some authorities, the letters Alef Mem Shin (!Ur.JK) also conceal a deeper mystery, which is Alef Vav Yud ('1K). 11 Another element of the mystery of the letters AMSh is the fact that they represent the reconciliation of opposites. Logically, there is no way in which opposites can be reconciled. These letters therefore represent a mystery that cannot be penetrated by logic. One commentator states that the letters AMSh contain the mys­tery through which one can walk on fire.12 The reason for this may be because these letters have the power to reconcile opposites. It is possible that Rav Zeira made use of this technique to prevent his fe et from being burned in fire, as related in the Talmud.13 Sealed with six rings The obvious scriptural source is the verse, \"The script which is written in the King's name and sealed with the King's ring, cannot be reversed\" (Esther 8:8). Accord ing to this, the \"rings\" here would be the rings of the King's name, that is, the letters YHV ( 1;,•). The Kabbalists therefore say that these six ri ngs are the six directions, which, as the Sefer Yetzirah (I: 13) earlier says, were \"sealed\" with the letters YHV (1;,•).1 4 Behind the permutations of the letters YHV is the deeper mystery o f the permutations of the letters AMSh, now under discussion. These six directions, which comprise the physical universe, are what hide the deeper mysteries. It is thus written, \"He has set the universe in their heart. so that man cannot find out the work that God has done. from the beginning to the end\" (Ecclesiastes 3: I 0). As the commentaries point out, the word \"universe\" here in Hebrew is 0/am (0'?1).1). It comes from the root A/am (o?:v), meaning \"occlusion,\" and also has this connotation. As long as a person can only think in terms of the physical dimensions of space, the inner reality is con­cealed fr om him. Also significant is the fact that a ring is normally worn on the finger. As the Sefer Yetzirah states (I: 3), the Ten Sefirot are repre-"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Chapter Three 143 sented by the ten fingers. The six rings are thus worn on the six \"fingers\" corresponding to the six Sefirot, which represent the six directions.15 The \" six rings\" here also allude to the \"six rings of the throat,\" mentioned in the Zohar.1 6 It is fr om these rings that all sound and speech are derived. These six rings, which are the source of physical speech, conceal the mystery of AMSh, which relates to the root of speech. This mystery can only be penetrated when one transcends the realm of physical speech. From them eminated air. water and fire This is the process described in detail in chapter one (1 :9- 12). From them are born Fathers The three Mother letters, AMSh (lt'r.J�), represent cause, effect and their synthesis. Shin (!t7) is cause, Mem (r.J) is effect, and Alef (�) is the synthesis between these two opposites. In the Tree of Life dia­gram, these are represented by three horizontal lines. These three horizontal lines give rise to the three vertical col­umns in the Tree of Life diagram, headed by Keter, Chakhmah, and Binah. These are represented by \" air, water, and fire.\" We therefore begin with a dialectic triad: \"Creator, \" \"object of creation,\" and \"act of creation.\" This gives rise to a second triad: love, judgment, and mercy. This second triad defines the three col­umns into which the Sefirot are arranged.17 The three horizontal lines are the three Mothers. The three col­umns define the three Fathers, which are the letters Yud Heh Vav (1:1•). It was fr om these letters that space is defined, as the Sefer Yetzirah states earlier (I: 13). Once space is defined, then creation can take place. This can also be understood in a meditative sense. Through the pronunciation of the letters AMSh, one enters the realm of Chakhmah consciousness, and passes through the Chashmal. One then passes through t he domains of Breath, water and fire, as described earl ier (I: 14). At this time, one must be in a totally recep­tive mode, which is an aspect of the feminine. Hence, the letters AMSh are called \"Mothers.\" After this, however, one can enter into a creative mode through the letters YHV. These letters are therefore called \"Fathers.\" Only then can one produce \"descendents.\""},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"144 SEFER YETZIRAH 3:3 i�j?to 1.:;,1y p Yn jppn to\"r.J� mr.J� to�to tJ�1V:I to\"r.J� !11r.J� to�to 0:1:1 1Y1 j1'lJ:11 to.:;,J:� to\"r.J� n,r.J� to�to, :1Jto.:J to\"r.J� n,r.J� to�to, :;-t.Jj?J, i:JT Three Mothers: Alef Mem Shin (vr.J�) He engraved them, He ca rved them, He permuted them, He weighed them, He transfo rmed them, And ll'ith them lie depicted Three .Hothers Alo.JSh (vo�) in the Universe, Three .lfothers AMSh (vr.J�) in the Ye ar, Three Jfothers AMSh (vo�) in the Soul, male and female.

In both cases, there are five processes: engraving, carving, permuting, weighing, and transforming. When, as in chapter two, all 22 letters are given equal status, then all five dimensions as the five phonetic families (2:3). Here, on the other hand, the three Mothers are taken separately. The five dimensions are therefore also divided into three domains: Universe, Year, and Soul. The Universe consists of the three spacial dimen­sions, Year consists of the time dimension, while Soul consists of the spiritual dimension. A similar division into three domains was encountered earlier, in chapter one, when the Sefirot were first enumerated. First enumer­ated was the domain of Soul, the spiritual dimension, which con­sisted of \"Breath,\" and \"Breath from Breath\" (I :9, I 0). Then came the domain of Year, the time dimension, consisting of Water and Fire (1:11-12). Finally came the domain of Universe, the three spacial dimensions, represented by the six permutations of the letters YHV (I: I 3 ). The Sefer Yetzirah stated earlier (I: I 3) that the three letters YHV, which define the space continuum, are derived from AMSh."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Chapter Three 145 Therefore, it is the letters AMSh which separate the space continuum fr om that of time and the spiritual. There is an important difference between the space continuum and the other two. It is only in space that one can move voluntarily. In time, one moves in one direction at a predetermined rate. In the spiritual dimension, a physical body cannot move at all. Only the soul can move through the spiritual dimension, and it is for this rea­son that this domain is called Soul. The letters AMSh differentiate space fr om time and soul. These same letters can therefore be used to do away with this diffe­rentiation. 3:4 t:J'.':Jt7 t7N t:J'r.J 1'1N ot,1:V.J t7\"r.JN nmN wt,w n11l.J 1'1N1 t:J'l.Jl.J nN1.JJ r1N1 t7Nl.J 1N1:JJ :t:J' nJ'.J :V'1::lr.J Three Mothers.

In chapter one, the text discussed the spiritual aspect of \" Breath, water and fire,\" in terms of the original four Sefirot. Here it is speak­ing of how these three arc also manifest in the physical world. In the simplest physical terms, \"water\" repesents matter, \"fire\" is energy, and \"air\" is the space that allows the two to interact. 18 On a somewhat deeper physical level, fire, water and air repre­sent the three basic physical forces. \"Fire\" is the electromagnetic force, through which all matter interacts. The atomic nucleus, how­ever, consists of like positive charges, which would repel each other if only electromagnetism existed. There must therefore exist another force which can bind the nucleus together. This is the \" strong nuclear\" or pionic force, which binds the nucleus together, repre-"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"146 SEFER YETZIRAH Figure .fl.

On the other hand, even within each elementary particle. there is a need fo r a cohesive fo rce to counteract the electromagnetic repulsion within the particle itself. This force can be neither electromagnetic nor pionic. This is the '\"air,\" which represents the \"weak nuclear\" force, which \"decides between\" the other two. It is this force that allows light particles (lep­tons) such as electrons to exist. See figure 41. The fourth force, gravity, corresponds to \"earth.\" Earth, however is not a basic element, but a confluence of the other three.19 It is therefore represented by the final Heh in the Tetragrammaton, whic h is actually a repetition of the first Heh in this name. On an even more elementary level, these three elements repre­sent the three axes in the unitary symmetry, SU(3), which is the most basic property of matter. These three elements also relate to the experiential. Here, fire represents the radiation of energy, while water represents the absorp­tion of energy. These arc thesis and antithesis, giving and receiving, which themselves are manifestati ons of cause and effect. Air, which represents the transmission of energy is then the synthesis, linking the two."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Chapter Three 147 In this aspect, fire and water also represent the psychological modes of Binah and Chakhmah consciousness. As discussed earlier, \"fire\" is Binah consciousness, where the mind itself is constantly radiating energy. \"Water,\" on the other hand, is Chakhmah con­sciousness, where the mind can absorb spiritual energy fr om without. \"Air\" is then Ruach HaKodesh, the medium through which such spir­itual energy is transmitted. Heaven is created from fire This is the same as the statement made above ( 1: 12). Our experi­ence and depicting of the transcendental sphere must be brought into Binah consciousness. In a physical sense, fire represents radiative energy. This usually takes place by means of the electromagnetic interaction in the form of light. \"Heaven\" here represents the concept of space as defined by the electromagnetic interaction, this being an important cornerstone of the principle of Relativity. Fire represents Binah, and as discussed earlier (I: I), the word Binah comes fr om the root Beyn, meaning \"between.\" It is from Binah that the concept of separation comes into being. Furthermore, it is only as a result of the concept of separation that space can exist. If not for Binah, all existence would be concentrated in a single point. In the same manner, \"earth is created fr om water.\" \"Earth\" rep­resents the solid state, where matter exists with a minimum of space separating its molecules. This stems fr om Chakhmah, which tends to minimize separation and distance. In a gas such as air, the molecules tend to fly apart and separate. Yet. at the same time, they are held together just suffici ently to give the gas substance. Gas is therefore always in a state of contained expansion. This is intermediate between the containment of solid matter and the total expansion of pure radiation. Fire is represented by the letter Shin. Shin is the dominant letter in the word Esh (v�), meaning fire. It is joined with the Alef, repre­senting air, because a fire cannot exist without air.2° The three heads of the Shin also suggest the flames of the fire. The hissing sound of this letter furthermore i s like the hiss of a flame. The three heads of the Shin are separated, suggesting the general concept of separation. Corresponding to the Shin is the letter Heh (;,), which is only one of the two letters in the alphabet consisting of two disconnected parts."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"148 SEFER YETZIRAH Water is represented by the letter Mem. Here again, Mem is t he dominant letter in the word Mayim (c•o), meaning water. Indeed, the very name of the letter Mem comes fr om the word Mayim.21 Mem is also a closed letter, indicating containment and unity. 22 It is also sounded with t he mouth closed. It parallels the letter Yud (' ) , which is written as a single point. Air is represented by Alef, since it is the initial letter of Avir (1•1�), meaning \"air.\" Alef is a silent letter, whose sound is as undetectable as the invisible air. In shape, it consists of an upper right and a lower left dot, representing two opposites, with a diagonal line in the mid­dle, which both separates and connects t he two. 3:5 om .;-t�111 11p om ;-tJW:J W\"r.JN .n,r.JN wt,w n11r.J ;'1�111 o�r.Jr.J N1:JJ 1,j? t7Nr.J N1:JJ :o�m�:J :v�1::m Three Mothers AMSh (10o�) in the Ye ar are the hot the cold and the temperate.

There is t he hot summer and the cold winter, which are thesis and anti thesis. The two temper­ate seasons, spring and autumn, are both taken togeth er and are spo­ken of as the temperate season. This is the synthesis. Here we see t he concept of a cycle between opposites. This cycle, like many others. constantly swings between two opposites. At the midpoint in each swing, no matter in which direction, the cycle must pass through the intermediate midpoint. Thus. both in going from hot to cold, and from cold to hot, the cycle must pass through a temperate season. I t is out of cycles such as t hese that time is defined. The Sefer Yetzirah therefore states that the Cycle is the king in the domain of time (6:3)."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Chapter Three 149 In the annual cycle, winter is represented by Mem (o), summer by Shin ('e'), and the two temperate seasons by Alef (�'(). The complete cycle is then defined by the letters MAShA (�'e'�r.l). Taking their paral­lels, these correspond to the letters YVHV (1:11• ). This is closely related, but somewhat different than the Tetragrammaton, YHVH ( :11:1' ). In the Tetragrammaton, the ordering of the letters is YHV ( 1:1•). Here thesi s and synthesi s are seen as opposites, representing tension and equilibrium. Antithesis i s then the midpoint connecting the two. The fourth letter of the Tetragrammaton, the Heh, is also a point of tension. The temperate The Hebrew word for \"temperate,\" here, is Ravayah (:1•11). This use of the word Ravayah is virtually unique in Hebrew literature. The usual interpretation of Ravayah is abundence, as in the verse, \"my cup is abundent (ravayah)\" (Psalms 23:5). It should be recalled that it is fr om this verse that some Kabbalists find an allu­sion to the 221 Gates, discussed earlier (2:4). One reason for the use of Ravayah to denote the spring and fall was because these two were the harvest seasons in the Holy Land. The most obvious source for this usage is the verse, \"We have come through fi re and water, You brought us out to Ravayah\" (Psalms 66: 12). Some commentaries interpret Ravayah here to also mean \"abundance,\" but fr om the context, \"temperate\" seems to be a more logical interpretation. Ravayah would then denote the desired meaning between \" fire\" and \" water.\" The Sefer Yetzirah also uses this word in such a sense. It is significant to note that the Talmud interprets \"fire and water\" in this verse to denote psychological states.23 The Midrash likewise interprets \"fire and water\" in this verse as referring to two opposing kinds of purgatory.24 Fire is the overabundance of sensation, and i t is also related to shame.25 Water. on the other hand, denotes lack of sensation, and is related to depression. Ravayah is then the perfect mental state between these two extremes. Some authorities also say that the word Ravayah is related to the word Yo reh (:111•), which denotes the early autumn rains.26"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"!50 SEFER YETZIRAH 3:6 ��:11 WN1 :1:1j?J, 1:H W:lJ:I W\"rJN !1,1JN wt,w :1'U1 0'1J1J N1:1J ��:1, WNrJ N1:1J WN1 .:1'U1 :0'!1J':I V'1::lrJ m11J Th ree Mothers AMSh (!OrJN) in the Soul, male and fe male, are the head, belly, and chest.

One reason for this is because the soul is an exact counterpart of the body. Everything found in the body is also found in the soul. Similarly. the human body is a microcosm of the supernal \"Man.\" See figure 42 on page 151. This is the \" Man\" sitting on the throne, seen by Ezekiel. The supernal \"Man\" represents the array of the Sefirot. The \"Soul\" mentioned here then also refers to the anthro­pomorphic representation of this array. With respect to the Sefirot, Shin is the line between Chakhmah and Binah; Alef, between Chesed and Gevurah: and Mem, between Netzach and Hod. The top line represents the head, the center line, the chest, and the lower line, the bellyY According to Rabbi Abraham Abulafia, there is also an allusion here to the two covenants mentioned above (I :3). The covenant of the tongue is in the head, while the covenant of circumcision is in the region of the belly. Between the two, in the chest, is the heart, which is king over the soul (6:3). This alludes to the Torah, which is the primary covenant. 2X The head also represents man's creative power, which is repre­sented by fire. The belly is man's receptive power, represented by water. The chest and lungs must both inhale and exhale, and there­fore pertain to both. In a deeper sense, the head is seen as the center of Binah con­sciousness. It is the head that is the seat of the conscious stream of thought. The workings of the belly, on the other hand, are almost completely subconscious. The belly therefore parallels the Mem, which denotes Chakhmah consciousness. It is for this reason that some mystics would contemplate their belly when attempting to attain Chakhmah consciousness."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"( 'hapter Three 151 8 Binah Chakhmah 8 Hod Netzach Figure 42 .

One usually breathes unconsciously. but one can also control one's breathing consciously. Breathing is therefore associated with both Binah and Chakhmah consciousness. It is for this reason t hat con­trolled breathing techniques are important in making the transition between these two states. Breathing is centered in the chest. The chest The Hebrew word for \"chest\" here is Gaviyah (;,•1l).�9 The use of Gariyah for chest is also unique in Hebrew literature. Usually, the word refers to the body as a whole, and some commentaries here also state that it denotes the entire trunk.3° A possible scriptural source for this may come fr om Ezekiel's vision. where he said of the Chayot, \"With two [wings] they covered their Gm·i_vah\" (Ezekiel I: II). The scripture may be saying that they covered their chest and heart with two of their wings. 31 Some commentaries interpret Gaviya h to denote the sexual organ.1c In the language of the Mishnah, we indeed fi nd that the \"head of the Gari_rah\" refers to the tip of the male organ.33 How­ever. as the major commentaries note, only the term, \"head of the Ciaviyah\" has this connotation, and not the word Gaviyah itself. 34 3:7 1n:J ,� 1tvp, m1:1 '� n,� 1'�0:1 :1Jie'.J :1,,,, 0�1l).J ,,,� 0:-I.J 1Y, :1i.J :1i j::l1Y, :O\"tt'�.J :1.Jj?J1 tt'\"r.J�.J 1:Jt tt'�J.J :-I'm He made the feller Ale,((:.:) king over Breath And He hound a croll'n to it .lnd lie comhined them one with another .lnd tt·ith themllefhrmed .I ir in the L'n i rersc The temperate in the Year And the chest in the Soul: The male with A.HSh (ltl�JN) And the fe male with ASh.\\1 (�Jlt!Nj."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Chapter Three !53 He made Ale! king Most simply, this means that with regard to concepts related to Breath, Alef is always the first letter in the permutation.35 In a deeper sense, this means that Alef was bound to the Sefirah of Malkhut (Kingship). Malkhut is said to be the \"mouth,\" and as such, it is the Sefirah through which the power of all the other Sefirot is expressed. 36 The first stage is therefore to make the letter \"king.\" This means that it is brought to the \"mouth,\" which is the Sefirah of MalkhutY Bound a crown to it This indicates that the letters are bound to the highest of the Sefirot, Keter. As the Sefer Yetzirah states earlier (I :9), this is the direct Breath. Malkhut, on the other hand, is reflected Breath. Before a letter can be expressed t hrough Malkhut, it must be bound to Keter. Thus, the \"End is imbedded in the beginning\" (I :7). This also speaks of the physical letters, which have small \"crowns\" called Ta ggin on top. The Talmud thus says that when Moses ascended to heaven, he saw God \"binding crowns to the letters.\"38 These crowns represent the higher spiritual nature of the let­ters.39 I f the letters themselves are in Assiyah, then the crowns on top bind them to Yetzirah. 4o Air, temperate, chest In Hebrew, air is Avir (1'11'(), temperate is Ravayah (;\"1'11), and chest is Gevi yah (;\"T'1l). Except for the Resh in Avir, all of these words are spelled the same: AVYR 1'11'( RVYH ;\"1'11 GVYH ;\"!'1l The endings of these words is consistantly VYH (;\"1•1). This repre­sents the hidden power of the letters Yud Heh Vav (1;\"1') in the three Mothers AMSh. It is signi ficant to note that in these words, the order of the let­ters is VYH (;\"1'1). Since Vav (1) corresponds to Alef (!'(), Yud (•) corre­sponds t o Mem (o), and Heh (;\"!) corresponds to Shin (v), the letters VYH (;\"1•1) are in the same order as AMSh (vo�). The word Avir is written with a Resh (1) instead of a Heh (;\"!).

Male and Female Rabbi Eliezar Rokeach of Wormes writes that if one wishes to create a male Golem. then the sequence AMSh (vo�) must be used. If one wishes to create a female Golem, then the sequence must be AShM (ov�). If one wishes to destroy the Golem, then the sequence is ShMA (�ov)Y The Hebrew word for man is Ish (v•�). while that for woman is !shah (;,v�).

As ment ioned earlier, Yud is male, while Heh is female. These letters take the place of the Mem, which is the belly, since it is here that man and woman are differentiated.44 Also significant is the position of the Shin, which represents fire and passion.

Highly significant is the fact that the Resh (1) is here considered to be one of the Doubles. Most post-Talmudical grammarians take precisely the opposite view, and state that the Resh never takes a Dagesh. Not only is there no verbal distinction between the hard and soft Resh, but modern Hebrew grammar does not even recognize such a difference in the written form. There are, however, ten different words, appearing in fourteen places in the Bible, which are written with a Resh containing a Dagesh.2 See Table 28. It is obvious. however, that the usual rules applying to the letters BGD KPT (!l!l-' il.:l), do not apply to the Resh. The present sound of the Resh is a fr icative, and is therefore most probably the soft sound. The hard Resh was either lost or deliberately concealed after the destruction of the Temple. In earlier times, its use was standard, and there is evidence fr om their transliteration of names, that its pronunciation was known to the authors of the Septuagent. 3 By the lOth century, however, the double Resh was only used by the mem­bers of the small Mazya community in Tiberias.4 Tiberias had been the last city in which the Sanhedrin, the great court which preserved the tradition. had flourished. 5 This was one of the mysteries that the Sanhedrin had entrusted to the community of Tiberias. According to the Sefer Yetzirah (2:3), Resh is in the group of Dentals, ZSShRTz (:nvor). Along with the letters Zayin (r), Samekh (o). Shin (v), and Tzadi (Y), it is pronounced with the teeth. Accord­ing to the Long Version (2:1), it is sounded \"between the teeth, with the tongue lying down, spread out.\" We cannot say that it is a rolled"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"Chapter Four 161 r sound, since this involves the tip of the tongue. It would then be closest to the I sound, and should be included among the Linguals, DTLNTh (m�u1). Furthermore, the hard Resh should be a plosive, like all the other hard doubles. There is no r sound in use today that meets all these criteria. Furthermore, there is no plosive sound pronounced with the teeth that could be a candidate for the hard Resh. The original pronuncia­tion of this letter therefore remains a mystery. Hard and Soft The h ard sound is currently indicated by a dot in the middle of the letter, known as a Dagesh. Before printing was introduced, most manuscripts also indi­cated the soft sound by a line above the letter, known as a Rafeh. This device is used in the Damascus \"Keter Torah\" Pentateuch, written in the ninth century.6 In the Firkovich collection of the Library of the Academy of Science in Leni ngrad, there is a codex of the Bible, dated from the year 916, that also makes use ofthe Rafeh. As late as 1480, this mark is found in handwritten Bibles and Prayer Books.7 The use of this mark is also mentioned by the Tikkuney Zohar. It states that the Rafeh above the letter is like t he \"firmament above the Chayot\" (Ezekiel 1 :22).8 The Tikkuney Zohar also states that the hard and soft sounds are related to the \"Chayot running and returning\" (Ezekiel 1: 14 ). It says, \"they run with the hard sound, and return with the soft. \"9 According to some commentaries, this indicates that the hard plo­sive sound is pronounced more quickly than the soft fricative sound.1 0 However, since the Sefer Yetzirah (l :6) teaches that \"running and return ing\" also relates to meditative techniques, it would appear that the hard and soft sounds were used for this purpose. These seven Doubles would be used to climb the vertical lines in the Tree of Life. When the initiate would use the letters to \"run\" and climb upward, he would use the hard sound, and when he would \"return,\" he would use the soft sound. The B ahir states that the letters are the body of the script, while the vowels are its soul.11 The later Kabbalists note that the Dagesh and Rafeh are neither vowels nor letters, but intermediate between the two. 12 It is this intermediate essence that man must perfect if he is to enter the domain of Soul."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"162 SEFER YETZIRAH 4:2 :V1t 1t71V :1r.J:m 11,0' I'1\"1.!:l;:) 1\"l.:J n,�,.!:l;, :V.:JW :rm m�w ;,�wr.Jr.J o\"n Seven Doubles: BCD KPRT (m!l:J 1l:J) Th eir fo undation is Wisdom.

Two of these concepts are alluded to in the Talmud: \"He who wishes wisdom, let him face south; He who wishes wealth, let h im face north.\"1 6 This was reflected in the Temple, where the Menorah, which related to wisdom, was to the south, while the Table, indicat­ing wealth, was to the north. We see here that the letter Resh indicates peace. When there is no peace, this letter cannot be sounded correctly. The Holy Palace This is usually interpreted to denote Malkhut.17 The Hebrew word for \"Palace\" here is Hekhal (?;,•;,). This has a numerical value of 65, the same as that of Adonoy (•Ji�), the divine Name associated with Malkhut.1s Besides being the lowest Sefirah, Malkhut is also the end point of the Keter-Malkhut spiritual dimension. The \"Holy Palace\" in the center therefore not only relates to Malkhut alone, but also to its asso­ciation with Keter. In channeling sustenance fr om Keter, the center point supports al l the others.19 According to the Bahir, \"Hekhal HaKodesh \" here should not be read as \"Holy Palace,\" but as \"Palace of the Holy.\"20 The \"Holy\""},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Chapter Four 165 denotes Keter, and the \"Palace of the Holy\" refers to Malkhut when it is directly connected to Keter in the mystery of \"Imbed their begin­ning in their end\" (I: 7). The also represents a great mystery in creation, as explained by Rabbi Judah Liva (1525- 1609), the Mah aral of Prague, famed as the creator of a Golem. He states that the reason why the world was cre­ated in six days is because a three-dimensional world has six direc­tions, as the Sefer Yetzirah states here. Each day was necessary to complete one of these six directions. The Sabbath is then the center point, which binds all together and supports them all.21 The Sabbath thus represents Malkhut, but in the mode in which it is bound to Keter. These seven elements also parallel the seven branches of the MenorahY They are also alluded to in the verse, \"Seven eyes on one stone\" (Zechariah 3:9). 23 Another such allusion is the verse, \"Give a portion to seven, also to eight\" (Ecclesiastes 11 :2). 24 As discussed ear­lier (I :3), the number seven denotes the perfection of creation, while eight is the entrance into the transcendental. 4:5 WW �t,, V:JW J1\"1�� 1\"l:J J11t,1�� V:JW o;-r:J 11j?n1 o;-r:J i1n:J ;-tJ1rJW �t,, V:JW :m�rJ t,v ,y,� :Jw;-r, ,�,,:J t,v 1::11 1rJV;-r, Seven Doubles: BGD KPRT (m:>;, 1l::J) Seven and not six Seven and not eight Examine with them And probe with them Make [each/ thing stand on its essence And make the Creator sit on His base.

The seven lower Sefirot arc merely the lower end points of these seven vertical lines."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"166 SEFER YETZIRAH These letters are therefore the ladders leading upward fr om the seven lower Sefirot, and this i s the way in which the two are associ­ated. One of the main functions of the seven Doubles is thus to climb vertically on the ladder of the Sefirot. One rises through their hard sound, and descends with their soft sound. The Sefer Yetzirah warned us earlier that there were Ten Sefirot, no more and no less (I :4). Here the text warns us that there are seven vertical paths, no more and no less. If an e ighth vertical path were added, it would be taken as a path from Keter to the Infinite Being, and such a path cannot exist. Furthermore, if a path to Keter were omitted, one might be misled into thinking that Keter is God, and this is also erroneous. Examine with them This is also similar to I :4. One can probe and examine with these letters very much like one does with the Sefirot. In I :4, however, the text also said, \"Understand with wisdom, and be wise with Understanding,\" while here this is omitted. The discussion there involved the basic exercise of fluctuating between Chakhmah and Binah consciousness. Here, the exercise involves the letters themselves, rather than pure states of consciousness. Probe with them In 1:4 the reading was \"probefrom them,\" while here it is \"probe with them.\" When the text spoke of the Sefirot themselves, it could say, \"probe from them,\" since it is from the Sefirot that one receives spir­i t ual energy. Here. however, it is not the letters that provide spiritual energy, but the Sefirot to which they relate. The text therefore states, \"probe with them.\" indicating that the letters are the tools through which one can probe.]6 The upper six of these seven Sefirot represent the six directions. Malkhut is the center point, the \"Holy Palace.\" Taken subjectively, this \"center point\" is the center of being of the individual reaching up to the Sefirot.

In order to understand the significance of the astrological forces, we must first understand the role of angels in the chain between the Sefirot a nd the physical world. The Sefirot are in the Universe of Atzilut, and below this is Beriyah, the universe of the Throne, which serves to allow the Sefirot to interact with the lower worlds. Between Beriyah and Asiyah is Yetzirah, the world of the angels. Yetzirah i s known as the \" world of speech. \" The Talmud states that \"Every word eminating from God creates an angel. \"32 This means that every one of God's words is actually an angel. When we speak of \"God's word,\" we are actually speaking of His interaction with the lower worlds. The force that transverses the spiritual domain is what we call an angel. The stars also form a n important link in God's providence over the physical world.D Between God and man, there are many levels of interaction, the lowest being those of the a ngels and the stars. The Midrash thus teaches, \"There is no blade of grass that does not have a constellation (Maza[) over it, telling it to grow.\"34"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"170 SEFER YETZIRAH Satur n � Kaptziel Jupiter z < Tzidkiel Mars � Sa mae!

As the commentaries explain, God's providence works through the angels, but these angels, in turn, work through the stars and plan­ets. As some authorities put it, the angels are, in a sense, like souls to the stars. Thus. for example, some sources speak of the stars as having intelligence, but the commentaries note that this is actually speaking of the angels that are associated with them.35 There are, however, two types of angels. We have already spoken of the teaching that there are angels created with every word of God. Elsewhere we find that angels are created every day, with a new troop being made each morn ing. 36 On the other hand, there are many angels who are known by name, such as Gabriel and Michael, who have per­manent existence. These are obviously a second kind of angel. This is closely related to another discussion. In the Midrash, there is a question as to when the angels were created.

They state t hat there are t wo basic kinds of angels: permenant angels and temporary angels. The temporary angels were created on the second day, while the permanent ones, which are likened to the birds, were created on the fifth. They also state that an important difference between t he permanent and temporary angels is the fact that only the permanent ones have names.38 One of the most important factors in astrology is the time and date of a person's birth. The Talmud thus states that there is a \"Mazal of the hour.\"39 The time, day, and date upon which a person is born has an important influence on his destiny. Elsewhere the Talmud teaches that there is an angel called Laylah that oversees birth. It is this angel that proclaims if the indi­vidual will be strong or weak, wise or foolish, rich or poor.40 Earl ier, however, we discussed the Midrashic teaching, \"One angel cannot have two missions, and two angels cannot share the same mission\" (l :7). 41 But if this is a general rule, how can a single"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"172 0 ---o--1 I I II II 0 b SEFER YETZIRAH Yatath Ring Tath Spear mer three lines Sat it CurYed line Ladder with two steps -\\grept1 Spear O\\er fo ur lines Marom Ring Sham riel Crooked Mem Figure 45.

The same question also applies to all the permanent angels who have names. These angels, which were created on the fifth day, exist forever. In the course of their existence, they must have many tasks and missions. Why does this rule not hold true with regard to them? In answering these questions, the commentaries note that the angels are like souls to the stars. 42 A human soul is also a spiritual entity, and the same question could be asked about it. How can a single soul be involved in many tasks? But here the answer is obvious. The soul is integrated by its association with a single body. I t is not differentiated into many souls by its many tasks, because its associa­tion with the body allows it to remain an integrated whole. The same is true of the angels having names.

As such, each star serves as a focus for a particular angel, maintaining it as an integrated whole, even though it may h ave many different tasks. There is therefore a one-to-one relationship between the stars and angels. Each star has its own particular angel, and each angel has its own star. It is this relationship that allows the named angels to have many tasks, and still not be differentiated into many angels by these tasks. Each named angel is integrated by the star that serves as its body. This also explains why the permane nt angels have names. The Zohar teaches that every single star in the universe has a name.43 This is derived fr om the verse, \"He brings out their host by number, He calls them all by name\" (Isaiah 40:26). It is also written, \"He counts the number of the stars, He gives them each a name\" (Psalms 147:4). The Midrash indicat es that the different names of the stars corre­spond to the names of the different angels.44 The one-to-one relation­ship is therefore clearly expressed.

There are a number of variations in these assignments, and the more important ones are given in Table 33 on pages 178-1 79. Each letter can be used to influence the part of the body with which it is associated. This can be accomplished through using the array of 221 (or 231) Gates associated with that letter. These letters are used in a similar manner when creating a Golem. Most important are the relationships between the letters, days of the week, and planets and between the seven primary traits: Wisdom, Wealth. Seed, Life, Dominance, Peace and Grace. One can use the methods of the Sefer Yetzirah to attain or enhance any one of these by using the soft pronunciation of the seven Doubles. If one wishes to transmit their opposite, one uses the hard pronunciation. Like other stanzas, this can also be read in the imperative: \"Make Bet king over Wisdom, bind a crown to it, and combine one with another, and with them form .... \" The meditation involves using the seven Doubles in this manner. The dominant letter is placed at the beginning, and the other six let­ters are then permuted. Thus, if one was seeking to transmit Wisdom, o ne would place Bet (J) at the beginning, and one would then per­mute the remaining letters, GO KPRT (!1i!J:l 1l), in every possible manner. Similarly, if one were seeking Wealth, one would place Gimel (l) at the beginning, and would permute the letters BD KPRT (mJJ;� 1:::1) in all 720 possible ways. The permutation with which one begins is given in Table 34 on page 180. At the same time, one should contemplate the part of the body associated with that particular trait. Thus, for Wisdom, one would concentrate on the right eye, while for Wealth, on the right ear. In a similar manner, one should also concentrate on the appropriate direction. Also important is the day of the week associated with each trait. If one wishes to transmit a certain trait, it is best done on the speci­fied day of the week. In using these methods, one must also take planetary influences into account. Besides the influences given here, there are others given in Bereita of Shmuel HaKatan, which appear to be closer to those expressed in Western astrology.45 See Table 35 on page 180. Influence extends only fr om the visible members of our solar sys­tem. The distant planets such as Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, which are invisible to the unaided eye, are not considered to have any sig­nificant astrological influence. If one were to take these into account, one would also have to consider dozens of asteroids which would exert an even greater influence."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Table 33.

The influence of the planets in the system of Sefer Yetzirah does not depend on their position in the sky, but on the hour of the day. This is discussed in a number of Talmudical and Kabbalistic sources.46 In order of their distance fr om Earth, the planets are: Saturn , Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus. Mercury, Moon. Of these, Saturn is fur­thest fr om the Earth, a nd the Moon is closest.47 According to the Bible, the stars and planets were made on the Fourth Day of creation (Genesis I: 14-19). Counting fr om Sunday, the Fourth Day was Wednesday. In Biblical reckoni ng, however, night always preceeds day. The Torah therefore consistently says, \"It was evening, and it was morn­ing.\" Evening always preceeds morning. The planets were placed in their positions on the eve of the Fourth Day, that is, on Tuesday night. They were placed one at a time. an hour apart, in order of their distance fr om earth. Thus. in the first hour ( 6 \"M ), Saturn was placed in its position. In the second hour (7 \"\\t). Jupiter was positioned. The order of creation o f the seven planets was then as follows:"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"( 'haprer Four 181 First hour 6 PM.

Moon This is the ordering found of the eve of Wednesday on the chart of planetary influences. Each planet then dominated the hour in which it was positioned. After the first seven hours, their dominance began a new cycle, with the planets in the same order. This seven hour cycle continues throught the week, and it is the same every week. The entire weekly cycle is given in the tabel of planetary influences see Table 36 on page 182. One immediately notices that the first hour of each evening is dominated by a different planet, in the following order: Sun. Mon. Tues. Wed. Thurs. Fri. Sat. Mercury Jupiter Ven us Saturn Sun Moon Mars The first hour of each day is dominated by the planets in the following manner: S un. Mon. Tues. Wed. Thurs. Fri. Sat. Sun Moon Mars Mercury Jupiter Venus Saturn (Tew) (Woden) (Thor) (Frigg) N ote that the name of each day is associated with the planet that dominates its first hour in the morning.48 Thus, S unday is dominated by the S un, Monday (moon day), by the Moon, and Saturday, by Sat­urn. In the English names of the other days, the Nordic or Germanic names of the planets are used. The Romans had originally named the days after the planets dominating their first hour. This nomenclature still survives in the R omance languages. Thus, in French, Tuesday is Mardi (Mars' day), Wednesday is Mercredi (Mercury's day), Thursday is Jeudi (Jupiter's day). and Friday is Vendredi (Venus' day). Saturn dominates Saturday. which is the Sabbath. In Hebrew, Sabbath is Shabbat (m10), and hence, Saturn is called Shabbatai ( '�I\"l:JIO ).

Seven Universes 185 The later Kabbalists write that these are the Seven Chambers in the Universe of Beriyah.56 These are given in Table 40 on page 186. Of these, the two lowest, \" Brickwork of Sapphire\" and \"Essence of Heaven,\" a re mentioned in the verse, \" They saw the God of Israel, and under His feet was the 'Brickwork of Sapphire,' clear like the 'Essence of Heaven'\" (Exodus 24: I 0). These Seven Chambers parallel the seven lower Sefirot in the Universe of Atzilut. They also parallel the seven watches of angels in the Universe of Yetzirah. Some early sauces state that these Seven Universes are the seven thousand years that the world is supposed to existY The first six par­allel the six weekdays, while the seventh thousand years is the \"day when all will be Sabbath. \"5H Others relate the Seven Universes to the Kabbalistic doctrine of Sabbaticals. This states that there are seven distinct periods of cre­ation, each lasting seven thousand years.59 According to some Kabbalists. the present creation is the second, while others state that it is the sixth or seventh. In any case, there are seven cycles, each seven thousand years long. This means that the universe as we know it will last for 49,000 years."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"186 SEFER YETZIRAH Tahle 40. The seven chambers of the Universe of Beriyah. Kodesh Kedashim Ratzon Ahavah Zekhut Nogah Etzem HaShamayim Livnat HaSappir Holy of Holies Desire Love Merit Luster Essence of Heaven Brickwork of Sapphire According to the master Kabbalists, Rabbi Isaac of Acco, when counting the years of these cycles, one must not use an ordinary phys­ical year, but rather, a divine year.60 The Midrash says that each divine day is a thousand years, basing this on the verse, \"A thousand years in Your sight are as but yesterday\" (Psalms 90:4).61 Since each year contains 3651/4 days, a divine year would be 365,250 years long. According to this, each cycle of seven thousand divine years would consist of 2,556, 750,000 earthly years. This figure of two-and­a-half billion years is very close to the scient ific estimate as to the length of time that life has existed on earth. If we assume that the seventh cycle began with the Biblical account of creation, then this would have occurred when the universe was 15, 340,500,000 years old. This is very close to the scientific esti­mate that the expansion of the universe began some fifteen billion years ago. The current Hebrew year is 5736. In this calendar, the year in which Adam was created is counted as year one. If we then count the Biblical genealogies fr om the time of Adam, we find that 5736 years have elapsed since the time he was formed. However, the Kabbalists clearly say that other human beings existed before Adam, and this is even supported in scripture.62 Actually, there are two accounts of creation in the Book of Gene­sis. The first chapter of Genesis speaks of the init ial creation of the universe, while the second chapter speaks of the creation of Adam. During the six days of creation described in the first chapter, God did not actually create the world, but rather, created the ingredients which would allow the world to develop. It thus refers to the creation of all matter, along with space and time.61 It was during these six days that God brought the umverse into being fr om absolute nothingness. 64 After these six days of creation, God allowed the universe to develop by itself, renewing His creation each seven thousand divine years or 2.5 billion earthly years.

The fi ft h cycle was the one that brought forth life, and this took place around two and a half billion years ago. Around 974 generations before Adam, or some 25,000 years ago, man developed all the physical and mental capabilities that we possess todayY This man had evolved fr om \"the dust of the earth\" (Gene­sis 2:7), but he still lacked the divine soul that would make him a spiritual being. God then created Adam, the fi rst true human being with a soul, \"and He blew in his nostrils a soul of life\" (Genesis 2: 7). 68 According to tradition, the creation of Adam took place on Rosh HaShanah, the Hebrew New Year, which occurred on Sep­tember 9, 3761 scE69 Seven Firmaments These are listed in the Long Version (4:13) as being: Vilon, Rakia, Shechakim, Zevul, Ma'on, Makhon, Aravot. These are also mentioned in the Talmud. 70 See Table 41. According to the Ari, these parallel the seven lower Sefirot of the Universe of Asiyah.71 Seven Earths The Long Version ( 4: 13) lists these as: Adamah, Tevel, Nashiyah, Tzaya, Chalad, Eretz, Chalad.

They also parallel the seven attri­butes under discussion here. Seven Seas Many commentaries state that these are the seven lakes and seas in the Holy Land.70 In modern terminology, the seven seas represent the seven oceans: the Nort h Atlantic, South Atlantic, Nort h Pacific, South Pacific, Indian Ocean, Arctic Ocean, Antarctic Ocean. The seas in the Holy Land represent a microcosm of these oceans. Seven Rivers These are the seven rivers associated with the Holy Land: The Jordan, Yarmoch, Kirmyon. Poga, Pishon, Gichon, Chidekel.77 The Euphrates is not counted because it includes them all. 78 These parallel the great rivers of the world. Seven Deserts These are the seven deserts through which the Israelites passed during the Exodus from Egypt: Eitan, Shur, Sin, Sinai, Paran, Tzin, Kadmut.79 Seven Days These are the seven days of the week. They are also the seven days of the major festivals, Pesach (Passover) and Succot (Tabernacles). Seven Weeks These are the seven weeks between Pesach and Shavuot.

Seven Sabbaticals At the end of seven Sabbatical cycles, the Jubilee year was cele­brated. All slaves would then be freed, and real property would be returned to its hereditary owner.

The First Temple stood for 410 years, and during this period, Israel observed seven jubilees. �0 This also relates to the concept of Sabbaticals of creation, where each jubilee period consists of 49,000 years. There will be seven such jubilee periods, and the universe will therefore last a total of 343,000 years. These are divine years, each one consisting of 365,250 earthly years. Thus, the total time between the initial expansion a n d final collapse of t he universe will be 125 ,287,500,000 years. This figure of 125 billion years is very close to the scientific calculation. After this period the universe will become completely spiritual. One of the aspects of the future world will be extreme longevity on the part of mankind. Regarding this period, it is foretold, \"As a child one shall die at a hundred years old\" (Isaia h 65:20). 81 According to Rabbi Isaac of Acco, the lifespan will have become so extended th at one who dies at t he age of a hundred will be considered like a child currently dying at the age of 3. Thus, the normal lifespan will be approximately 33 times its present value, or around 2,000 years. 82 Isaac of Acco furthermore states that these will be divine years, so the human lifespan will eventually be extended to the order of eighty million years!83"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"190 SEFER YETZIRAH The Holy Palace The is the seventh point. the center of the other six. as explained above ( 4:4 ).

These are the \"2 stones\" that \"build 2 houses.\" If one has 3 letters, one can make 6 permutations: ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA. Use has already been made of this above (I: 13, 3:6-8). In a similar manner, 4 letters can be permuted in 24 ways, and 5 in 120. The numbers are not difficult to obtain. If one starts with one letter X, a second letter can be placed either to its right or to its left. This gives 2 permutations: A X and XA. Now if we take each combination XY, we can place a third letter in three possible positions: AXY, XA Y, XYA. Since the letters XY themselves could be permuted in 2 ways, the total number of permu­tations is 2 x 3, or 6. Similarly, if we have 3 letters XYZ, a fourth letter can be placed in one of 4 places: AXYZ, XA YZ, X Y AZ, XYZA. Since th e 3 letters XYZ can be permuted in 6 different ways, the total number of per­mutations is 6 x 4, or 24. If we then take 4 letters WXYZ, a fifth letter can be inserted on one of 5 places: A WXYZ, W AXYZ, WXA Y Z, WXY AZ, WXYZA. Since WXYZ can be permuted in 24 ways, the total number of per­mutations is 5 x 24, or 120. We therefore see, that for a given number of letters, the number of permutations is given by Ix2x3x .... xN. This is known as N factorial, and is usually written n! The number of permutations for all numbers of letters up to 22 is given in Tables 42 and 43 on page I 92. In generaL letter permutations played an important role in the practices of the meditative Kabbalists. These permutations were often chanted very much like a mantra in order to bring about a desired state of consciousness. 86 A number of such texts contain extensive tables of such permutationsY That wh ich the mouth cannot speak This expression is also found in the Talmud.88 Assume that a person wished to pronounce all 5040 possible per­mutations of seven letters.

Then comes Gad and Asher, the sons of Leah's handmaid, Zilpah, who were born after the sons of Bilhah. A number of authorities list the twelve tribes in this order.4 According to this, Joseph's sign comes out to be Pisces (Dagim), and this is also reflected in Talmudic teachings5 (see Table 44). Other authorities list the tribes in the order of their camps in the desert. 6 See figure 4 7 on page 200. This order is: Judah, Issachar, Zebulun; Reuben, Simeon, Gad; Ephraim, Manasseh, Benjamin; Dan, Asher, Naftali.7 On the eastern camp was Judah, lssachar and Zebulun; on the south, Reuben, Simeon, and Gad; on the west, Ephraim, Menasseh, and Benjamin, a nd on the north, Dan, Asher, and Naftali. According to some authorities, this was also the order of the stones on the Urim and Thumim.8 This change of order occured after Levi was given the priesthood and removed fr om the order of the tribes. To complete the twelve, Joseph was divided into two tribes, Ephraim and Manasseh. This was in accordance to Jacob's blessing, \"Ephraim and Manasseh shall be like Reuben and Simeon to me\" (Genesis 48:5). When the traits are in the order given in our (Gra) version, the tribes must be matched up with them in the order of the camps.9 The division of Joseph, however, is not considered, and therefore, Joseph is in the place of Ephraim, and Levi in the place of Manasseh.

The use of t he term h ere would imply that the diagonal boundaries actually extend beyond the realm of space and time. Earlier, when the Sefer Yetzirah ( 4:4) spoke of the six primary directions. it did not call them boundaries. The reason why they are called \"boundaries\" (gerulim) here is because they are used in"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"206 SEFER YETZIRAH method of meditating on the \"boundaries\" of space. The initiate meditates on the four letters Bet which seal the universe on four sides. setting the limits of thought. 2 2 He also meditates on the twelve permutations of the Tctragrammaton, which correspond to the twelve diagonals. In this manner. he can reach the level where they extend to \"eternity of eternities,\" beyond the realm of space and time. In discussing the twelve diagonals, the Bahir says, \"On the inside of them is the Tree.\"21 This is the Tree of Life, the array of the Ten Sefirot. connected by the 22 letters. The Tree is not inside the twelve boundaries from an earthly point of view, since it is external to the physical universe. It is only inside these boundaries when viewed fr om the point at infinity, that has been discussed earlier (I :7). It is at this point that all the boundaries are unified. When a person meditates on the infinity of the diagonal bound­aries. he is a lso able to move along the diagonal paths in the Tree of Life. This is important, since it is much easier to ascend along the diagonals than along the vertical paths. Boundar ies of the Universe These boundaries parallel the boundaries of the twelve tribes mentioned in Ezekiel 48. Each o f these diagonal boundaries relates to one of the twelve tribes. According to the Talmud, these boundaries correspond to the twelve pillars upon which the universe rests. 24 This is based on the verse. \"He stood up the boundaries of the nations, according to the number of the children o f Israel\" (Deuteronomy 32:8). The Talmud also relates these to the \"arms of the universe.\" Instead of \"boundaries of the Universe,\" the Short Version reads. \"arms of the Universe.\"25 The obvious allusion is to the verse (Deuteronomy 33:26-27): There is none like the God of Jeshurun The Rider of the heavens is your Helper His pride is in the skies (shckhakim). A dwelling is the God of eternity And below are the Arms of the Universe He drives the enemy from before you And He said, \"Destroy!\" This verse occurs after the blessing of the tribes, where Moses blesses the entire nation of Israel. 26 Although the verse is speaking of"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"( 'haptcr Fil'c 207 God helping the Israelites in a mundane sense, it also has mystical overtones. Moses begins by calling God, \"the Rider of the heavens.\" The word \"rider,\" rokhev (�::l11), is closely related to markava (;\"1�::l1r.J), the mystical \"chariot\" that is the essence of the mystical experience. The concept of \"riding\" involves traveling and leaving one's natural placeY When Moses says that God \" rides\" the heavens, it means that He leaves His natural state where He is absolutely unknowable and inconceivable, and allows Himself to be visualized in a mystical vision. As the verse continues, this takes place through the skies known as Shekhakim. This term always refers to the two Sefirot, Netzach and Hod, which are the Sefirot involved in prophecy and inspiration.28 It then says, \" A dwelling (me'onah) is the God of eternity.\" As discussed earlier (I :5), the word ma'on (and me'onah) indi cate a level above space and time, the \"place of the universe.\"29 The word for \"eternal\" here is Kedem, which usually indicates Keter.30 The Hebrew word for Crown, Keter (1m) also comes fr om the root Katar (1m), meaning to \"surround.\"31 It is through the attribute of Keter or Kedem (eternity) that God encompasses all space and time. It is below this that there exist the \" Arms ofthe U niverse.\" These are the infinities involving the twelve diagonal boundaries. On the h ighest level, we conceive of God as being totally divorced fr om all space and time. This conception involves a state of consciousness that pertains neither to perception nor to nonperception. On a lower level, we see Him as the one who defines space and time, as the \"Place of the Universe.\" This involves a state o f consciousness perceiving Nothingness. On a still lower level, we see God as being beyond the boundaries of the universe. Thus, if a person wishes to experience God, he must begin at the lower level and work his way upward. He therefore begins with the \"arms of the Universe,\" contemplating the infinity of space in the twelve diagonal boundaries. Only after this can he reach the level of \"a Dwelling is the God of eternity,\" where he conceives God as the \"Place of the Universe.\" Finally, however, he must attain a concep­tion of God as being totally divorced from space a nd time. He then sees Him as the \"Rider of the heavens,\" who merely uses all depic­tions as a means through which He can be conceptualized. A very important element in attaining the mystical experience is the negation of the self. When a person sees himself as nothing, then his self becomes transparent to the Divine. Commenting on the verse, \"from under the Arms of the Universe,\" the Talmud states that a per­son must \"make himself like he does not exist.\"32 Through contem­plating the infinities of the universe, one can nullify the ego."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"20� SEFER YETZIRAH In another very significant teaching, the Talmud states that, \"The spirit (ruach) depends on the stormwind (sa 'arah) ... and the stormwind hangs fr om the arms of God.\"\" This is also based on the verse, \"From under the Arms of the Universe.\" The stormwind (sa 'arah), however, was the fi rst manifestion of Ezekiel's vision, as he says, \"I looked, and behold, a storm wind coming out of the north\" (Ezekiel 1:4).34 The stormwind relates to the stormy state of con­sciousness that precedes the true mystical experience, which is called \"Spirit\" (Ruach). The Talmud states that the state of Sa 'arah, which is the gateway to the mystical experience. depends on the Arms of the U nivese. One attains this state when one meditates on the infinities of the diagonal boundaries and the permutations of the Tetragrammaton associated with them. In the text here. we see that the ordering of the twelve diagonal boundaries begins with the cast and ends with the north. Since the last direction upon which one meditates is the north, Ezekiel saw the \"stormwind coming from the north.\" The state of \"storm wind,\" as well as the \" great cloud, and flash­ing fire\" seen by Ezekiel are the forces of the evil Husks (Kiipah), which must be breached before one can enter into the mysteries.35 The passage in Deuteronomy therefore concludes, \"He drives the enemy from before you.\" Since after contemplating the \"Arms of the Universe,\" one encounters the enemy-the Klipah-Moses had to promise that God would drive this force away and allow one to enter unharmed.·16 In the Long Version, the reading here in Sefer Yetzirah is \"Heights of the Universe.\" Some commentaries state that these \"Heights\" are the \"Arms of the Universe.\"37 The term. \"Heights of the Universe,\" occurs three times in scrip­ture. In Jacob's blessing to Joseph, he grants him. \"the desire of the Heights of the Universe\" (Genesis 49:26). Moses likewise blessed t he tribe of Joseph with. \"the treasure of the Heights of the Universe\" (Deuteronomy 33: 15)_3x The Zohar states that these Heights are related to the feminine principle in creation. especially to the Sefirah of Malkhut.39 It is through meditation on the twelve infinite lines of the universe that one can enter into Malkhut and begin the climb up the Tree of Life. The twelve diagonal boundaries are therefore like transmission lines. through which creative energy flows into the universe from the twelve diagonal paths in the Tree of Life.

The intestines In Hebrew, the word here is Dakkin. This usually denotes the small intestine. but it can also include the large intestine or colon. In other versions. instead of Dakkin, the Sefer Yetzirah uses the term Massas or Hemsess. Ordinarily in Hebraic literature, this does not denote a human organ. The term usually refers to the Omasum or manyplies, the third stomach in ruminating (cud-chewing) animals such as cattle.40 See figure 53 on page 21J. This organ is also called the psalterium, since its Iongitudal folds are arranged like the leaves in a book. According to a number of commentaries, the Massas denotes the stomach in man.41 In a number of places. the midrash implies that the function of the Massas is to \"grind\" food.42 According to the substitution in the Gra Version here, it would appear that the analogue of the Massas in man is the small intestine. This is also supported by a number of authorities.43 This would be in agreement with the Kabbalists, since according to them, the stom­ach is the Korkeban. The Korkeban The term Korkeban is most often used to denote the gizzard in fowl.44 In the Talmud and Midrash, however, this term is occasion­ally if ra rely used to denote a human organ, usually identified with the \"grinding of food.\"45"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Chapter Fire Keres Rumen I st stomach Ki\\a -\\homasum 4th stomach Figure 53.

Maimonides states that the reason for this is because the Kivah is the fi rst among the digestive organs, and this opinion is echoed by the Kabbalists.55 According to this. the analogue in man would be the esophagus. The Talmud and Zohar, however, apparently teach that the main function of the lvah in man is to induce sleep. 56 This is also reflected in Sefer Yetzirah (5:9). This would indicate an organ of glandular nature, possibly the pancreas. Significantly, an early Midrash attri­butes to the Kiva, a \"sleep of sweetness. \"57 One reason why the Kii'G might be associated with sleep is because in animals it is the organ that digests milk. The human ana­logue may also be associated with milk, and milk is known to induce sleep. 5� The Talmud also states that in general, eating brings on sleep. 5� It is also possible that the Korkeban and Kiva are not human organs at all. This would mean that use is made of them only when the Sefer Yetzirah is used with relation to animals and birds. By mak­ing use of these organs. one may create an animal or bird rather than a human. This might have been the technique that the Talmudic sages used to create a prime calf. 5:7 1i0j?1 ;,n'iOJ ';, 111� l'�r.J:1 tJ�1VJ :1�t:l tJ:1J 1Y1 :1iJ :-it pnY1 1!1J 1� ::1Jj?.:l1 1:JT 'V!l.:l:l j'r.J' �l11 :1.:l'VJ j0'.:l1 1!\"1;) 1� 1'Vj?1 11:11:1J '1 !l1� 1'�r.J:1 :1.:liOJ 1\"�1 tJ�1VJ 1110 tJ:1J 1Y1 :1iJ :1i j!J1Y1 ::1Jj?.:l1 1:n iO!l.:lJ I1'.:lr.J' �'�1J1 :1iJ :1i j!J1Y1 1!1J 1� 1i0j?1 11�:-iJ 'i !11� l'�lJ:1 ��r.J'V �l11 :l.:l'VJ j1'01 tJ�1VJ tJ'r.J1�!l tJ:-iJ 1Y1 ::1Jj?.:l1 1;)T 'V!l.:lJ"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"Chapter Fire He made the letter Heh (;\"!) king over speech and He bound a crown to it And He combined one with another And with them He fo rmed Aries in the Un iverse Nissan in the Ye ar And the right fo ot in the Soul male and fe male.

The letters must then be added up, so as to determine the numerical value of both names.66 To determine the sign of the zodiac. one must cast off twelves, and take the remainder. That i s, one must divide the above sum by twelve. and determine the remainder. This is used to determine the sign of the zodiacY To determine the planetary influence, one must cast off sevens. Like before. one must divide by seven, and retain only the remainder. This is used to determine the appropriate planet. Note that in the table. the order of the planets is that of Saturday night. In Hebrew reckoning. this is the beginning of the fi rst day of the week, and hence. the fi rst period of creation. This method can more easily be understood if we take an exam­ple. Assume that a person's name is Abraham (o;,1J�) and his mother's name is Sarah (;,110). Making use of the numerical value for each letter. we sec that Abraham has a numerical value of 248, while that for Sarah is 505. Adding the two together. the final sum is 753. To determine the sign of the zodiac. we must divide by twelve, yielding 62. with a remainder of nine. Consulting Table 49 on page 220. we find that the appropriate sign is Capricorn . Similarly, to determine the planet. we divide 753 by seven. The quotient is 107. with a remainder of four. We thus find that Mars will exert a strong influence on a person named Abraham. who is the son of Sarah. Also important are the 28 \"camps\" of the Divine Presence, corre­sponding to the 28 days of the lunar month.6' The length of the lunar month is 29 days, 12 hours . 2643 seconds (29.53059 days).69 This is the period during which the Moon goes through all of its phases. Besides this. there is also the sidereal month. the time during which the Moon passes through all twelve signs of the zodiac. This period is 27 days, 6 hours, 780 seconds (27.25902 days). This is the period during which t he Moon revolves around the earth, and returns to its original position with regard to a fixed star. The lunar month is longer than the sidereal month. The reason for this is because, in order to complete a lunar month, the Moon must not only pass through the twelve signs of the zodiac. but it must also occupy its previous position in relation to the Sun. During this month, however, the Sun itself has advanced through the zodiac. The lunar month is therefore longer than the sidereal month by a factor of one twelfth. The Moon therefore passes through each of the twelve signs of the zodiac in 2 days, 6 hours. 1865 seconds (2.271585 days)."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"222 SEFER YETZIRAH Tahlc 50.

The 28 camps parallel the 28 \" times\" mentioned in Ecclesias­tes. 70 See Tables 50 and 51 on page 222. These are related to the seven qualities corresponding to the seven Doubles, as discussed above (4:2-3). See Table 52 on page 224. The 28 camps are associated with the twelve signs of the zodiac through the 42 Letter Name, given above (4: 14). See Table 53 on page 224. This name is combined with the letters of the Tetragram­maton in t he manner shown in figure 54 on page 225. This yields a total of 168 letters, or six for each of the 28 camps. The 168 letters can also be divided into twelve groups, each con­sisting of 14 letters. Each of these groups then corresponds to a spe­cific sign of the zodiac, as given in Table 54 on page 225. It i s these letters that are dominant as the Moon passes through each of the twelve signs. Also associated with each of the twelve signs is a permutation of the names YHVH and Adonoy (')1�). By meditating on these combi­nations, as well as t he derivatives of the 42 Letter Name, one can gain knowledge of things that will happen in t he designated times. See figure 55 on page 226. The 28 \"times\" o f Ecclesiastes can be divided into two groups of 14. One group consists of the good times, while the other consists of the evil times.

These 28 letters can therefore be used to transmit the appropriate concepts. There is another system that also provides insight into each hour of the day. As discussed earlier (2:5), when various letters are com­bined with the Tetragrammaton, five vowels are used. When one wishes to make such a combination relating to the hours of the day, however, one must add a sixth vowel, the Shva (:). 72 The array associ­ated with each letter of the Tetragrammaton then consists of 36 elements."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"224 SEFER YETZIRAH Table 52.

The term occurs neither in the Bible nor in the Talmud, and there is considerable discussion as to its meaning.1"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"232 Cap 1 corn S,tgtttar tllS SEFER YETZIRAH p,..,c,·-. :\\ r I�·� Libra V t rgo �0 v Gerntnl Figure 58.

This is a line with a ball at the end, used to ensnare animals. It would be called a Te li because the ball hangs (tafah) fr om the line. This is also supported by the fact that the scripture clearly states that Esau was to trap (!::.ad) an animal.

This Pole Serpent, which is identified with the Leviathan, may t hen be seen as an imaginary creature fr om which the earth hangs. Thus, in an ancient mystical Midrash, we find that the world \"hangs from a fin of the Leviathan.\" 7 The Pole Serpent is often associated with the constellatio n of Draco. x This is not surprising, since Draco is very close to the North Pole. Indeed, around 4500 years ago, Thuban, a star in Draco's tail, was the pole star. There are, however, two imaginary poles in the sky. The first is the celestial pole, which is directly above the earth's north pole. The second is known as the ecliptic pole. This is the pole of the sphere of which the ecliptic is the equator."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"234 SEFER YETZIRAH Ecliptic Figure 60. The Tcli as the obliquitY hctH·ecn equaror and cc/it)(ic. The ecliptic is the great circle of the celestial sphere traced by the plane of the earth's orbit around the sun. If we view the sun and stars as revolving around the earth, we will notice that in the course of the year, at a given time each day, the sun will occupy a slightly different position in relation to the constellations and other stars . In this perspective, the ecliptic is the annual path of the sun moving fr om west to cast through the heavens.9 In describing the positions of the stars, the ancients made use of the ecliptic pole, rather than the celestial pole. In this system, we find that the constellation of Draco actually surrounds the ecliptic pole. It also has stars in the sections of all the signs of the zodiac.10 It is therefore literally the Pole Serpent, since it is the serpent that sur­rounds the ecliptic pole. See figures 58 and 59 on pages 232 and 233. Since the Pole Serpent has stars in all the houses of the zodiac, it is also seen as supporting them all.11 It is as if Draco was at the top of the celestial sphere, and all the other stars were hanging fr om it. As such, Draco is seen as the overseer and director of all the other stars. Draco is therefore associated with the Teli, which, as the Sefer Yetzirah states (6:3), is \"over the Universe like a king on his thro ne.\" It is called the Teli because all the other constellations hang (talah) fr om it. In ancient times, the Te /i, in the form of Draco, was worshipped as an idolatrous deity.1\" Rabbi Isaac of Acco also identifi es it with the idol Baal, mentioned in the Bible. 13 Many philosophical commentaries on Sefer Yetzirah, as well as astronomical texts, interpret the Te li as being the inclination between two celestial planes.14 In modern astronomy, this is usually called the obliquity. and it usually denotes the inclination separating the eclip­tic and the celestial equator, which is the imaginary circle above the earth's equator. as shown in figure 60.

The point through which the planet passes fr om the south of the ecliptic plane to the north is called the ascending node, while the other point is known as the descending node. In medieval astronomy, the ascending node was often called the \"dragon's head.\" while the descending node was referred to as the \"dragon's tail.\" With regard to the intersection points of the equator and the ecliptic, these are the two equinoxes.

Most early Hebrew writers refer to it by its Arabic name. AI Ja::'har.17 Juz'har is a Persian word, meaning \" knot\" or \"node.\" Rabbi Abraham Abulafia also identifies the Teli with the celes­tial \"knots\" (Kesharim).1s He writes that the head of the Teli denotes merit. while its tail signifies liability.19 Especially important are the lunar nodes, since it is only at these points that an ecli pse. either of the sun or the moon, can occur.20 The Teli can then be seen as the imaginary dragon swallowing the sun or moon. Although the obliquity is often referred to as the Teli, it is ques­tionable if this is the Teli mentioned here by the Sefer Yetzirah. There is also a tradition that there are two Teli's or dragons. one male and the other female. These are identified as t he two Levia­thans. and are mentioned in the account of creation, \"God created the great dragons\" (Genesis I :21 ).21 According to the Talmud, the Pole Serpent mentioned by Isaiah is the male dragon, while the Coiled Serpent (Nachash Aka/ka/on) is the female.22 Some Kabbalists state that the constellation of Draco is the male Pole Serpent, while the inclination of the ecliptic is the female Coiled Serpent.23 The female therefore encompasses the male, this being the mystery of, \"a female shall surround a male\" (Jeremiah 31 :22).24 Other commentaries identify the Teli with the Milky Way, and say that this is the Pole Serpent. 25 According to this, the Teli would be the axis of the galaxy. rather than that of the celestial sphere. In the Book of Ra::iel. however, it appears that the Milky Way is called the River Dinur. mentioned in Daniel, and not the Teli.26 Another important opinion is that of the practical Kabbalists.

Rabbi Judah HaLevi (I 068-1 118) also writes that the Teli alludes to the spiritual world, and to hidden mysteries which cannot be grasped.28 Rabbi Abraham Abulafia similarly writes that the \" knots\" of the Teli are \"knots\" of love and mystical union.29 The nodes of the Teli are the points where two divergent orbits meet.

The Teli would then represent the nodes where the physical and spiritual meet. This picture is clarified through a Talmudic example. The Talmud presents a picture where. \"the stormwind hangs (latah) between the two arms of God like an amulet. \"30 This \"hanging\" can be identified with the Teli. As discussed earlier, the \"storm wind\" (sa 'arah) refers to the initiation into the prophetic or mystical experience.31 The two nodes of the Teli are the spiritual points from which this \"amulet\" hangs. The Talmud furthermore states that the \"arms\" fr om which it hangs are the \"arms of the universe.\" As discussed earlier, the \"arms of the universe\" denotes the twelve diagonal boundaries (5:2). One of the most significant interpretati ons is that of the Bahir. The Bahir states: \"What is the Teli? It i s the likeness before the Blessed Holy One. It is thus written, 'His locks are hanging (taltalim)' (Song of Songs 5: I I). \"32 The link with this biblical verse i s h ighly significant. In its entirety. the verse reads. \"His head is a treasure of fine gold, His locks arc hanging. black like a raven.\" In both Talmudic and Kabbalistic traditions, this verse has two interpretations. First. it relates to a vision of God, indicating that when He is visualized in battle. He is seen a young man with black hair. 13 The Kabbalists say that this is Zer Anpin (Small Face, Microprosopus), the personification of the six Sefirot fr om Chesed to Ycsod.14 The second interpretation relates this verse to the Torah. The Talmud states that the hanging (or piled) hair relates to the fact that every letter of the Torah contains \"piles and piles\" (!eli tela 'im) of wisdom. 35 Besides this, the hanging hairs are said to relate to the lines upon which the letters of the Torah are written.36 The Torah which is spoken of here is not the ordinary written Torah. but the primeval Torah, which was written \" with black fire on white fire.\"37 According to many K abbalists, this primeval Torah in itself is identified with Zer A npin. In this picture. each letter of the Torah is seen as a hair in the beard of Zcr Anpin. These are not seen as simple hairs, but as chan­nels. through which God's wisdom emanates fr om His \"head. \" The \"head\" is the concealed wisdom of God, while the letters are its out­ward rcvclation.3x The portion of God's wisdom that we can compre­hend bears the same relationship to His true wisdom that the hair docs to the brain. The brain is the center of all thought, while the h air is essentially dead. There is a world of d ifference between the two, yet all that we can comprehend is the \"hair.\" The verse says, \"His head is a treasure of fine gold.\" This refers to the unknowable d ivine Intellect. Since all that we can comprehend"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"Chapter Six 239 is a \"hair,\" the verse continues, \"His locks are hanging (piled), black like a raven.\" Even these hairs contain \"piles a n d piles\" (teli tela 'im) of wisdom. Still, it is \"black like a raven.\" Even these \"hairs\" are black and incomprehensible. Each of these h airs corresponds to a \"'point\" in the letters of the Torah.3� Each letter contains \"piles and piles\" of wisdom. These taltalim, which mean \"hangings\" or \"piles,\" thus refer to the divine wisdom that is revealed. According to the Midrash, how­ever, they do not refer to the letters themselves, but to the lines (sirtut) upon which they are written. When one writes a physical Torah. one must first draw lines upon which to write the letters. These lines are not actually drawn with ink, but are merely impressed into the parchment with a sharp instrument. These almost invisible lines represent the \"hanging\" of the hair, the link between the letter and its spritual root. From each hair in the divine beard of Zer Anpin, there hangs a universe. Each of these universes is also related to a letter in the Torah.40 According to this, the Teli denotes the \"hair\" in the d ivine beard fr om which our universe \"hangs.\" This is the axis around which the universe revolves. The Teli also relates to the meditation on a letter. In this medita­tion, one pictures the letters as written with black fire on white fire. One contemplates the letter, concentrating on the near invisible line upon which it is d rawn. This line is seen as a hair in the divine beard, from which the universe hangs. The scripture calls the \"hangings\" of the divine beard Ta ltalim. The Zohar relates this to the word Ta lp iot, which, as the Talmud teaches, is the \"hill (tell) to which all mouths (piot) turn. \"41 This \"hill\" is the mount upon which the Temple was built, which Jacob called the \"gate of heaven\" (Genesis 28: 17).42 This Ta lpiot is the tangible link between the physical and the spiritual. Accord ing to the Kabbalists, the same holds true of the Teli.43 The Cycle The Hebrew word for cycle here is Galgal. In a number of places in the Talmud, this word is also used to denote the cycle of events in the world.44 Later (6:3), the Galgal i s depicted as the king over time. This is because all time is defined by cyclic motion. The word Galgal also means sphere or circle. In some places in the Talmud the word is used to denote the sphere of the zodiac.45"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"240 SEFER YETZ!RAH The Sefcr Yetzirah (2:4) earlier stated that the 22 letters had to be fixed in the Ga/gal to produce the 231 Gates. The word Ga/ga/ therefore also denotes the mystical array of the 22 letters. In this respect. the Te li denotes the almost invisible lines upon which the letters arc written. The Ga/gal is the circle in which they arc drawn. The Scfcr Yetzirah also associated the mystical experience with the whirlwind known as a S4a h (1:6). It is significant that the prophet Isaiah associates such a whirlwind with the Galgal, saying, \"Like a sphere (galga[) before the whirlwind (sl{(ah)\" (Isaiah I 7: 13). It is also associated with God's voice. as in the verse, \"The voice of Your thunder was in the sphere (ga/ga[)\" (Psalms 77: 19).46 Most significantly. the Galgal is also seen as being below the feet of the Cherubim. God thus told an angel. \" Come to the innards o f the Galgal. beneath the Cherub\" (Ezekiel I 0:2). This Cherub is explicitcly identified with the Chayot seen in Ezekiel's initial vision. as he says. \"And the Cherubim went up, this is the Chayah that I saw on the river C hebar\" (Ezekiel I 0: 15). Earlier (I :3). we have also dis­cussed how the Cherubim serve as the focus of the mystical experi­ence. The Ga/gal is therefore a cycle that lifts one up to the level of the Chayot. which arc in the Universe of Yetzirah. The Bahir states that the Galgal is the WombY In one sense. this is speaking of the Galga/ as the cycle of time. The p resent is the womb in which the future is born. As we have seen earlier (I :5). the dimension of time is seen as extending between Chakhmah and Binah. Chakhmah is the past. while Binah is the future. The present is the interface between these two Sefirot. Binah is the Mother, and the Cia/gal is Her womb. An important cycle that we have discussed earlier (I :4) is the oscil­lation between Chakhmah and Binah consciousness. The first initiation into the spiritual domain comes through this exercise, and hence, as a Galgal. it is the entrance into the mysteries. In this sense. the Galgal is the womb from which one is reborn into a spiritual plane. The Heart The heart is seen as king over the soul (6:3). Of all parts in the body. it is the d ominant one. The soul relates to the spiritual dimen­sion. Thus. when the Sefer Yetzirah speaks of the mystical experi­ence, it describes it as a \"running of the heart\" (I :8). The Hebrew word for heart is Lev (::J�), and as mentioned earlier (I: I). this is also the number 32 in Hebrew. As the Bahir states, the heart represents the 32 Paths of Wisdom.48 It is through these 32"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"( \"haprer Sn 241 paths that one ascends into the spiritual dimension. The Book of Ra:::ie/ similarly states, \"Breath (Ruach ) emanates from the heart, just like the Holy Spirit (Ruach HaKodesh) emanates from the Throne [of Glory].\"\"� The Bahir also states that this Heart is the scriptural \" Heart of heaven.\" The one place where this is mentioned is in the account of the revelation at Sinai: \"You came close, and you stood under the moun­tain, and the mountain burned in fire, until the heart of heaven -darkness. cloud. and gloom. And God spoke to you fr om out of the fire\" (Deuteronomy 4:11,12).su From the context, we see that the fire that reached to \"the heart of heaven\" was the fire associated with revelation. from which God spoke. Such fire is the third step in the initiation of revelation, as we find in the case of Ezekiel's vision, which was initiated with \"a storm wind ... a great cloud, and flashing fire\" (Ezekiel I :4). It was only in the fire that he visualized the Chashmal. Similarly, in Elijah's vision. the three steps were, \"wind ... sound ... and fire\" (I Kings 19: 11-12). In one place, the Midrash also relates this fire to the ladder in Jacob's dream.51 This ladder is also the vehicle through which one climbs into the transcendental. The three steps mentioned by Ezekiel also appear parallel those taught by the Sefer Y etzira h (1: I 0-12). First comes Breath (Ruach), which can also be translated as wind, which is the \"stormwind\" of Ezekiel. Then comes \"water fr om Breath,\" which can be associated with the raincloud that he saw. The opaqueness of this cloud is simi­lar to the \"mire and clay\" mentioned in Sefer Yetzirah. The third step is \"fire fr om water. \" This is the \"flashing fire\" seen by Ezekiel. The Sefer Yetzirah says that out of this fire one depicts, \"The throne o f Glory, Serafim, Ophanim, and holy Chayot\" (I: 12). Similarly, after experiencing the fire, Ezekiel was able to visu­alize the Chayot and the Throne of Glory. It is this fire of revelation that is said to reach \"to the heart of heaven.\" The heart is the king over t he dimension of spirit, and one travels through this dimension by means of fire. This fire therefore reaches the \"heart.\" The Heart represents the 3 2 paths on the Tree of Life. In this verse. the scripture states that God spoke \"out of the fire.\" Elsewhere, however, it says, \"You heard His voice out of the midst of the darkness\" (Deuteronomy 5:20). But as the Zohar states, the \"fire\" mentioned here is the fire of darkness. 52 It is the burning long­ing that comes fr om the total nullification of thought. This is also associated with the \" black fire\" with which the primeval Torah was w ritten.53"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"242 SEFER YETZIRAH In the Kabbalah. the word \"heaven\" is usually associated with Zer Anpin. The \" heart of heaven\" is therefore the heart of Zer Anpin.5� It is significant that the Bahir relates the Teli to the hair on the head. while the Galga/ is related to the womb or belly. The Heart is naturally associated with the chest. Thus, fr om these three, we have the head. belly and chest, the three parts of the body associated with the Three Mothers, AMSh. The Jeli. associated with the head, would then relate to the Shin. The Ga/ga/, associated with the belly, would relate to the Mem, and the Heart , to the Alef. Out of the Three Mothers, we derive the kings over the Universe. Year and Soul. This results in the five­dimensional continuum being divided into space. time, and the spiritual. In another sense. the Teli is the axis, representing the longitudi­nal angle. The Galgal is the sphere, representing the asmuthal angle or latitude. The Heart is the radius or altitude. Thus, these three kings represent the three-dimensional in spherical coordinates. The five-dimensional continuum can likewise be represented i n hyperspherical coord inates. The Kabbalists note that the initial letters of Teli (•?n), Galga/ ('?l'?l) and Ler (:J'?) spell out Ta GeL (?m). This is in the verse, \"My soul will rejoice ( Ta Gef) in my God\" (Isaiah 61: I 0). 55 It is through meditation on these three elements that the soul can attain mystical ecstasy. This word also occurs in the verse, \"God is king, let the earth rejoice ( Ta Gel)\" (Psalms 97: I). This can be interpreted to say. \"God is King. Teli Galgal Lev is the earth,\" indicating that these are the three kings over His creation, as the Sefer Yetzirah later states (6:3). These are the deep mystery, as it is written, \"The mystery of another do not reveal (T'GaL)\" (Proverbs 25:9). 6:2 :1�Vr.J� t!� t!� t:J'r.J ,, ,� tJ\"r.J� nm� t'�t' jr.J'01 t:J' nJ'.J V'1;)r.J pn m1 ,,,�, :1�r.J� t:J'r.J1 �� !1j?11t!

Fire is above, water is below, and air of Breath is the rule that decides between them. And a sign of this thing is that fire supports water. Mem hums, Shin hisses, and Alef is the breath of air that decides between them. This is essentially a repetition of 3:4 and 2: I. 243 Water and Mem represent Chakhmah, while fi re and Shin denote Binah. Since Chakhmah is usually considered to be above Binah, it is somewhat difficult to understand why fire is seen as being above water.5 6 The reason behind this, however, is related to the penetration of Chakhmah and Binah into Zer Anpin (Microprosopus). The Kabbalists teach that Yesod of Chakhmah penetrates down to Yesod of Zer Anpin, while Yesod of Binah only penetrates as far as the heart (Tiferet) of Zer Anpin. Since Binah ends in the heart, it is often iden­tified with this organ. Chakhmah is clothed in Binah, and since Binah ends in the heart, it is there that Chakhmah is first revealed. The 32 Paths arc thus identified with the heart (LeV), which is Binah, but they arc also identified with ChakhmahY Thus, even though \"fire is above and water is below,\" still, \"fire supports water.\" Wisdom may penetate creation to a greater degree than Understanding, and may be found in lower levels, but still, Binah \"supports\" Chakhmah, and is below it. This is reflected in the sounds of the Mem and Shin, which represent these as states of consciOusness. As discussed earlier, on the basis of the Bahir, the Te li is identi­fied with the head, the Galgal with the belly, and the Heart with the chest. Thus, the Te li relates to Shin and fire, the Galgal, to Mem and water, and the Heart to Alef and air. What we therefore discover is that space is related to fire, time to water, and spirit to air. 6:3 l�r.J,:, ;-JJWJ �l�l 1�0,::, �V l�r.J,:, tJ�1VJ '�!1 :;,r.Jn�r.JJ l�r.J,:, W!lJJ J� ;-JJ'1r.JJ"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"244 SEFER YETZIRAH Th e Te li in the Lrnirerse is like a king on his throne. The ()de in the Ye ar is like a king in the province. The Heart in the Soul is like a king in war. The Te li in the Universe T he word \"king\" always alludes to the Sefirah of Malkhut (King­ship). It denotes the interaction between a ruler and his subjects. When we speak of an entity as a king, it is an indication that it is interacting with something that is below it. The Te li is the king over the Universe, that is, over the domain of space. It is seen as a \"king on his throne.\" Although the Te li inter­acts with space, it does not become part of it. We can see this in two ways. First of all, we can take the view that the Te li is the axis around which the universe revolves. In circu­lar motion around an axis, everything moves but the axis itself. The axis is the focus of the motion, but does not partake in it. Similarly, the Te li is king over space, but does not become part of it. The same is true if we view the Teli as the link between the spirit­ual and the physical. In this respect also, the spiritual does not enter into the physical.5� As discussed earlier, (I :4, 12), a \"Throne\" always involves a con­cept of lowering and concern. The Te li thus represents the spiritual being lowered so as to interact with the physical. Even though a king sitting on his throne may not come between his subjects, he is st ill highly affected by them. The spiritual is simi­larly affected by the physical. The Cycle in the Year Unlike the axis, the cycle not only defines time, but also becomes part of time. The cycle cannot stand still in time, but must include itself within the flow of time. Hence, it is like a \"king in the province.\" That which defines space can remain aloof fr om space. That which defines time, on the other hand, cannot remain apart fr om it. In human terms, it is the mind that provides a perception of both space and time. You can stand in one place and perceive a large por­tion of space. Like the Te li, you can perceive large areas of space, and still remain aloof from them. You do not actually have to be in a portion of space in order to perceive it. This is not true of time. You can only perceive the time in which you exist. You may perceive the past in memory, or the future in the"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"Chapter Six 245 imagination, but direct perception only exists in the present. You can perceive space at a distance, but time only when in proximity to it. Since no one can perceive the future, you cannot know what you will do later. It is due to this fact that you can have free will in the present. Thus, it is this basic difference between space and time that allows freedom of action. The Heart in the Soul The different spacial points, as well as past and future, involve end points in their respective continuums. Still, they do not represent opposites. In the spiritual dimension, on the other hand, the two end points are good and evil, and these are diametri cal opposites. Since the heart is the midpoint between t hese opposites, it is seen as the site of battle between good and evil. The Talmud therefore identifies the heart as the scene of the battle between the Good Urge ( Yerzer To v) and the Evil Urge ( Yetzer HaRa).59 6:4 !1r.J13)7 :m� 0':17� :1WV ;-tt !1r.J1V7 ;-tt !1� Ol .:m�;, V1r.J v, .J1t�r.J .Jm .Jm nmv7 v, v, :11mw :-t.Jm .J1t!:-t !1� pn.Jr.J V1:-t1 V1:-t !1� pn.Jr.J :O'V17 :-t11r.JW :-tV11 0'.J1t�7 'A./so God made one opposite the other\" (Ecclesiastes 7:14).

Like light and darkness, the two cannot coexist."},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"246 SEFER YETZIRAH Good from good As discussed earlier (I :5). good is the point on this axis that is closest to God. Evil is the side that is furt hest fr om Him. All good comes fr om the side of good, while all evil comes fr om the other side. Good defines evil The Zohar explains that light can only be recognized because of the existence of darkness. 60 If there were no darkness, light would be an integral part of the environment, and such an integral part cannot be sensed. Thus. for example, we cannot sense the air, since it is an integral part of our normal environment. Since air is always present. there is no need for us to have senses to detect its presence or absence . Similarly. if light were always present, without being divided into shades and colors, we could not see anything with it. Every shade or color involves some absorbtion of light, and hence, a degree of darkness. In a similar manner, good can only be recognized because of the existence of evil. If evil did not exist, then we would not have any free choice whatever. We would be like mere puppets or robots. It is only because of the existence of good and evil that fr ee will can exist, where we can choose between t hem. Conversely, it is only as a result of free will that good and evil can be recognized and defined. Good is kept fo r the good ones The dimension of good and evil not only serves to define these concepts, but also serves to reward them. It is taught that God cre­ated the world in order to bestow good to the world.6 1 But what good does He offer? First of alL we must realize that any good that God gives must be the ultimate good that His creation can accept. The Psalmist said \"How great is Your good. stored up for those who fear You\" (Psalms 31 :20). Our sages interpret this to say that God bestows good in the greatest possible abundance.62 In another place, they teach us that this verse means that God is telling us, \"You according to your strength, and Me according to Mine.\"6 3 In other words, God gives us the greatest good that we can possibly accept. But what is this ultimate good? What is the greatest possible good that God can bestow?"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"C 'hapter Six 247 If we think about it, the answer is really quite simple. The great­est possible good is God Himself.64 There is no other ultimate true good. The Psalmist thus said, \"I have no good but You\" (Psalms 16:2). In t he Talmud, Rabbi Acha interprets this to mean t hat no true good exists in the world, except that of God Himself. 65 The u ltimate good is therefore to partake of God, and it is this good that He planned to give the world. He would create a world where creatures ultimately could partake of His essence. The Psalmist sings of this, \"Taste and see that God is good, happy is the man who finds refuge in Him\" (Psalms 34:9). God therefore created t h e world in such a way that we could draw close to Him and partake of His essence. Of course, we are not speaking of physical closeness, but of spiritual closeness. Such close­ness involves the knowledge and understanding of God, as well as resembling Him to the greatest degree possible. Here again, we hear this in the words of the Psalmist, \"But for me, the nearness of God is good. I have made God my refuge, that I may tell of His works\" (Psalms 73:28). The Psalmist is teaching us that his ultimate good is nearness to God. This nearness involves \"telling of His works\"-that is, a deep knowledge and perception of the Divine. 66 The ultimate good that God offers is therefore the opportunity to perceive Him. In one place, our sages thus teach us that God cre­ated the world in order that men may know Him.67 This is not a sepa­rate reason, but the way in which He bestows His good upon us.68 God thus told us through His prophet, \"I am your God, I teach you for your good\" (Isaiah 48: I 7). The Psalmist expresses the same idea when he says, \"You are good, and You do good, teach me Your decrees\" (Psalms 119:68). To know God and understand Him in any way is to have a deep awe and dread of His Majesty. All true wisdom is that of God. But such wisdom and knowledge imply the fear and reverence of God. The Psalmist thus said, \"The beginning of Wisdom is the fe ar of God\" (Psal ms Ill: I 0). Solomon expressed the same idea when he said, \"The fear of God is the beginning of Knowledge\" (Proverbs I :7). 69 We can therefore say that the ultimate goal of creation is that we should come close to God, and therefore both know and fear Him. Again we hear t he words of Solomon, \" Whatever God does shall be forever ... God has made it so that man should fear Him\" (Ecclesias­tes 3: 14). The Talmud comments on this, saying that the world was created for the fear of God. 70 This is man's true purpose in the world, as we find again, \"The sum of the matter, when all has been heard: Fear God and keep His commandments, for this is all of man\" (Eccle-"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"24tl SEFER YETZIRAH siastes 12: 1 3). In the Talmud, Rabbi Elazar comments on this and says. \"Solomon is teaching us that all the world was created for the fear of God. \" 71 When our sages say that the world was created for the fear of God. they are not contradicting the teaching that it was created as a vehicle for His good. What they are doing is expressing what this good ultimately is. It is a knowledge of God that is most perfectly expressed by the reverence and awe that we cal l the \"fear of God.\" The ultimate place where we will be worthy of this vision and perception will be in what we call 0/am HaBah-The Future World or the World to Come. It is a world of absolute life and goodness. It is of the vision of the World to Come that the Psalmist is speaking of when he says. \"I believe that I will gaze upon God in the land of the living\" (Psalms 27: 13). This \"land of the living\" is the Future World.7 c It is this future world that is the goal of all creation. Our sages thus teach us, \"This world is like an antichamber before the World to Come. Prepare yourself in the antichamber before you enter the palace. \"'1 Since this Future World is the ultimate goal of creation, it is also the place of ultimate good. In the language of the Talmud, it is called, \"the World where all is good.\"74 It is a good that surpasses anything that this world may possibly have to offer. This is what our sages mean when they say. \"One moment of delight in the Future World is more than all the good of this world. \" 75 We can obtain some idea of what this Future World will be like from a common saying of Rav, quoted in the Talmud.76 He said, \"In the Future World. there will be no eating, drinking, childbearing or business. Neither will there be jealousy. hatred or strife. The right­eous will sit with their crowns on their heads, delighting in the radi­ance of the Divine Presence.\" Our sages teach us that this \"radiance of the Divine Presence\" is a perception of the Divine.77 In the Future World, we will perceive and comprehend God in the greatest degree possible. This perception of God in the Future World is totally beyond our present grasp. That of the least of us will pale the achievements of the greatest sages in this world. Still, of course, it will be impossible to perceive God in His entirety. This is impossible for any being other than God Himself. Although incomparable to anything in this life. our perception will st ill be less than a drop in an infinite ocean. Nevertheless. it will far exceed anything possible in this world.78 In order that we may approach Him, God created a dimension of nearness to His being. By moving through this dimension, we are able to come closer and closer to God, even though we can never actually reach Him. This dimension is what we call the spiritual"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"Chapter Six 249 world. Our sages call the highest spiritual world Atzilut-the World of Nearness. A ll the spiritual worlds were created as vehicles through which we may draw near to God. In a sense, they serve as a filter, allowing us to draw near, and still not be obliterated by H i s infinite Light. 79 In a number of places, our sages speak of these worlds as the Celestial Treasuries. Thus, Israel sings to God, \" The King will bring me into His chamber\" (Song of Songs I :4). The sages comment that God will bring the righteous into His celestial chambers and allow them to probe the treasuries on high. 80 This is also the meaning of the light that was made on the first day of creation. Our sages teach us that it was not mere physi cal light, but a wonderous light with which one could see \"from one end of the universe to the other.\" 8 1 This was the light of perception, shining in all the spiritual worlds, with which one could experience this vis ion of God. Our sages thus continue, \"God set this light aside for the righteous in the World to Come. \"8 2 This is the l ight of perception with which we will partake of the Divine-the \"radiance of the Divine Presence.\" Elihu was speaking of this when he told Job that God will \"turn back his soul from destruction, and illuminate him in the light of life\" (Job 33:30). Solo­mon informs us that this light is the source of eternal life, when he says, \"In the light of the King's face is life\" (Proverbs 16: 15).83 God's ultimate goal in creation was therefore the World to Come, where man could perceive a vision of God. Not God Himself, of course, but a vision. Perhaps through many filters, but still, a vision of God. The Psalmist sings of this vision, \"In righteousness, I will see Your face, when I awake, I will be satiated with a vision of You\" (Psalms 17: 15). The Psalmist is speaking of the time when he will awake to the delights of the Future World. Our sages comment on this verse, \"God will satisfy the righteous with a vision of the Divine Presence.\" B4 The bliss of the Future World will be endless. In His endless goodness, God will give us a world of good without end. The Psalmist is speaking of this when he exclaims, \" In Your presen ce is fullness of joy, in Your right hand is bliss forever\" (Psalms 16:11 ). 8 5 Of course, everything about this Future World is totally beyond our powers of description. Even the visions of the greatest prophets will pale in comparison. It is something that no human mind can pos­sibly imagine in this life. It cannot come through human understand­ing, but only as a gift fr om God, and when He gives it, we will under­stand. The prophet therefore says when speaking of the World to Come: \"Never has the ear heard it-no eye has seen it-other than God: That which He will do for those who hope in Him\" (Isaiah 64:3).Xo"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"250 SEFER YETZIRAH This good is not given as a reward, but as a direct result of a person's binding himself to good.

Seven: three opposite three The sequence three, seven, twelve, can be defined in a number of ways. One, which we have discussed earlier (I :2), involved the lines connecting the Sefirot. However, there is another important sequence that also yields these numbers. This second sequence can also be expressed in a number of ways. The most obvious involves the first three regular polygons. The sim­plest polygon. the triangle has three points. When inscribed in a square, one then has seven points. Finally, when both are inscribed in a pentagon. there are a total of twelve points. See figure 64 on page 252. On a more sophisticated level, this sequence can be represented by a triangle. a tetrahedron, and a hypertetrahedron. Another significant sequence that yields exactly the same result is that of truncated triangled. See figure 65 on page 252. Section A (figure 65) consists of three points. Here, the one to the right is the advocate, the one to the left is the accusor, and the middle point is the deciding one. This is the concept of thesis, anti­thesis, and synthesis, discussed earlier (2: I). Figure 66 (on page 253) consists of seven points in a truncated triangle. This can be divided into two triangles, each representing the original triad, and a center point in the middle. In the top section of fi gure 66, we can clearly see seven distinct steps from right to left. We also have twelve points in a truncated triangle shown in both fi gures 65 and 66. Here there are no longer seven distinct steps, since three are duplicated in the top and bottom lines. The three on top arc the ones that give life, while the three on the bottom are the three that kill. The triangle to the right represents love, while that to the left are the three who hate. (See section B in figure 66). Hate can also be represented in this diagram by a large inverted triangle. It is hate because the three points are separated. The smaller, inner triangle. where the points are not separated, then represents love. The two triangles to the right and left (in figure 66) are then life and death.

This implies that before God had spoken to him and told him to leave his land, Abraham had already mastered the mysteries of Sefer Yetzirah.

In order to derive the proper arrays fr om these tables, lines containing only eleven letters must be doubled. The other lines, which contain twenty-two letters, are left as they are. All the letters arc then paired into groups of two. One can see how this is done by comparing the table for Alef with the array given in chaper 2:4.

In Genesis 46, the ordering i s the same, but the son's of Leah's handmaid precede those of Rachel's. In Numbers 1:5-15, the order is the same as in Exodus l, except that Joseph precedes Benjamin, and the order of the sons of the handmaids is Dan, Asher, Gad, Naftali. In Numbers 13:4-15, the order is Reuben, Simeon, Judah, Isachar, Ephraim, Benja­min, Zebu1un, Manassah, Dan, Asher, Naftali, Gad. In Num­bers 24:6-29, it is Judah , Simeon, Benjamin, Dan, Manassah, Ephriam, Zebulun, Isachar, Asher, Naftali. (Reuben and Gad are not included, since they remained on the other side of the Jord an.) In Moses' blessing, the order is: Reuben, Judah, Levi, Benjamin, Joseph, Zebu1un, Isachar, Gad, Dan, Naftali, Asher. (Simeon is not mentioned, see Rashi on Deuteronomy 33:7.) In Deuteronomy 27: 12-13, for the blessings the order is: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Isachar, Joseph, Benjamin; for the curses: Reuben, Gad. Asher, Zebulun, Dan, Naftali. 3. Genesis 30, 35:23. 4.

The next verse, \"And Israel dwelt safely alone (badad), the eye of Jacob,\" also has mystical connotations. The word badad is often used to indicate meditation, see Ibn Ezra on Isaiah 44:25. The verse can then read, \"And Israel dwelt safely meditating.\" 37. Cf Bachya on Genesis 49:26. 38. The third is Habakkuk 3:6. This is a highly mystical chapter, discussed extensively in the Bahir68-79, 147- 1 48, 187- 193. The question may arise why the Long Version uses \"heights of the universe,\" which is only in the blessing of Joseph, instead of \"arms of the universe,\" which applies to all Israel. But if Joseph ben Uziel was the author of the Long Version, he may have done this to allude to his name. 39. Zohar 1:50a, 1:274b, 2:22a. Cf Rosh HaShanah !Ia, S1jri on Deuteronomy 33: 15.
