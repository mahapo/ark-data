Out of this same research emerged my first book The Gnostic Imagmation: Gnosticzsm, Mandaeism, and Merkabah Mysticism, which focused on the theoretical issues involved in a com-parison of these traditions and touched on a number of theological issues, such as the link between the hypostatic body of God and transformative knowledge. The present study may be read as a com-panion volume to The Gnostic Imagination insofar as it examines the same religious movements. Whereas the first book explored method-ologies and broadly examined Merkabah mysticism, Gnosticism, and Mandaeism, the present work takes a magnifying glass to a single topic within these traditions: the myth of the angelic vice regent."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION \"Truth did not come into the world naked, but it came in types and images\" Gospel of Philip 67:10 One of the most important types to mediate between the divine realm and the material world in late antique religions was the angel-ic vice regent. As the name implies, the angelic vice regent func-tioned as a theological counterpart to the political vice regent. Just as the human vice regent mediated between the emperor and his realm, so the angelic vice regent mediated between God and the world. Thus, the angelic vice regent frequently functioned as judge and governor of the world, guardian of the divine dwelling, priest of the heavenly tabernacle, and even as a divine hypostasis and demi-urgic figure. More than any other figure in late antique religions, the angelic vice regent embodies the logic of mediation. Certainly the angelic vice regent was not the sole mediator figure in late antique religions, but he was the mediator par excellence. The angelic vice regent medi-ated between the physical and pleromatic worlds, divine and human existence, transcendence and immanence. The mediating functions of the angelic vice regent reveal his quintessentially mythical charac-ter, as Levi-Strauss has written: \"myths seem to be entirely devoted to exhausting all the possible solutions to the problem of bridging the gap between the two and the one.\"' This book will illuminate a highly important topic within the his-tory of angels. Angels have fascinated human beings for thousands of years and continue to do so today, as the current host of books on angels attests. The important position of the angelic vice regent in the theologies and cosmologies of Late Antiquity teaches us much about what it meant to be divine or human in this period. Thus, the angelic vice regent holds at least one key to understanding the basic theological and anthropological structures of Late Antiquity. 1 Claude Levi-Strauss, Structural Anthropology, Vol I, New York and London, 1963, p. 226."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"2 CHAPTER ONE I will examine a number of angelic vice regents including the Jewish figures Metatron and Akatriel, the Gnostic figure Sabaoth and the Mandaean figure Abathur.2 The role of the angelic vice regent in early Christianity requires a monograph of its own. Because of this I have merely oudined the profile of Jesus as a vice regent, as well as certain Muslim and Hermetic traditions, in appendices. The com-parative study of angelic vice regents in Merkabah mysticism, Gnosticism, and Mandaeism is important for several reasons. The development of highly similar angelic vice regent traditions within Merkabah mysticism, Gnosticism, and Mandaeism indicates that all three movements struggled with the same theological questions and sometimes attempted to solve these questions in parallel ways. By contrast, the differences between Jewish, Gnostic, and Mandaean angelic vice regents highlights the sometimes conflicting orientations of these religious traditions. My comparative examination will reveal that Jewish, Gnostic, and Mandaean sources drew on a common pool of biblical and intertestamental Jewish traditions in construct-ing the myths of their respective angelic vice regent figures. A number of scholars, most notably Gershom Scholem, have examined the relationship between Merkabah mysticism and Gnosticism. In another study, I examined this topic in detail, plac-ing particular focus on Scholem's work.3 Although Merkabah mysti-cism is not a form of Gnosticism, as Scholem would sometimes have had it, there are a number of important elements shared by the two movements. These include common cosmological and angelogical motifs, a belief in transformative knowledge, and a valorization of the image of God. Studies on the relationship between Mandaeism andJudaism have long focused on the areas of ethics and ritual. 4 While cosmological and theological issues have attracted some attention, many impor-tant topics remain unexplored. Of particular interest are the many parallels between Mandaeism and different forms of Jewish mysti-cism including the Kabbalah and the Hekhalot materiaP 2 Although not all of these figures are angels, per se, their character justifies this convenient appellation. 3 Nathaniel Deutsch, 77ze Gnostic lmaginaticm: Gnosticism, Mandaeism, and Merkabah Mysticism, Leiden, 1995.

First of all, Jews and Mandaeans lived in close proximity in Babylonia. According to their own accounts, the Mandaeans were settled in the same area as the Jews, even living in the two major centers of Jewish learning: Sura and Pumbeditha.6 In addition to their geographical closeness, there are other indications that Jews and Mandaeans had close contact. Throughout Mandaean litera-ture, we find strong anti-Jewish polemics, a phenomenon which would imply some first hand knowledge of Judaism, at the very least, and, perhaps, an actual competition between Mandaeism and Judaism. The severity of anti-Jewish polemics in the Mandaean lit-erature has even provoked Kurt Rudolph to theorize the existence of' \"periodic oppressions by Babylonian Jewry. \"7 Their geographical closeness, the anti-Jewish polemics, and the mutually comprehensible dialects of Aramaic spoken by the two groups makes it very likely that Mandaeans andJews influenced one another, as Alexander has written, \"the Mandaeans were, for sever-al centuries, in close historical contact with the rabbinic communi-ties of Babylonia in which Merkabah mysticism flourished. \"8 On the linguistic closeness between Mandaic and the Aramaic spoken by the Jews of Babylonia, Theodor Noldeke, one of the nineteenth century pioneers in Mandaean research, wrote: Mandaean is closely related to the ordinary dialect of the Babylonian Talmud. Both the dialects are neighbours, geographically speak-ing ..... actually, we may asssume that the language of the Babylonian Talmud was that used in Upper, and Mandaean that used in Lower Babylonia.' See H. Odeberg, 3 Enoch or The Hebrew Book of Enoch, New York, 1973 (reprint), pp. 64-77. In his \"Prolegomenon\" to Odeberg's edition of 3 Enoch, p. xxxix, Jonas Greenfield sharply criticized such parallels as \"mostly verbal and are on the whole meaningless.\" While Greenfield correctly characterizes many of the parallels pro-posed by Odeberg, he is too broad in his criticism. In several instances, Odeberg illuminated valid comparative issues by juxtaposing parallel passages from Mandaean literature and 3 Enoch. I will revisit some of these parallels in my section on the Mandaean vice regent figure Abathur. 6 E. S. Drower, The Haran Gawaita and the Baptism o/ Hibil-Ziwa, Vaticano, 1953, p. 10. 7 K.

Besides these indications of contact, there is the complex question of whether Mandaeism developed out of Palestinian Jewish roots and the debate over the extent of Jewish elements in Mandaeism. Perhaps Scholem was correct in his intuition thatJudaism and Mandaeism were more closely intertwined than generally thought: Christian Gnosticism in Babylonia, too, seems to have been preced-ed by a form of Jewish Gnosticism, one which in this case assimi-lated Jewish and Persian elements and intertwined the one with the other. Indeed, I think it can be shown by a closer study of the much discussed Mandaean texts (in which the Jewish elements are much stronger than generally supposed) that such a process may well have taken place.1' Throughout this volume I will point out parallels between Mandaean andJewish material, primarily from Merkabah mysticism but in a few cases from the Kabbalah as well. In a few places I will suggest that certain Mandaean and Jewish sources may have a polemical relationship with one another. Although scholars have been intrigued by the question of the relationship between Mandaeism and Judaism sin~e the nineteenth century, most studies have focused on the issue of origins and specifically on whether Mandaeism developed out of Judaism. In a few cases, parallels between Mandaean andJewish traditions have been noted and ana-lyzed but the field remains in its infancy. Particularly interesting are the tantalizing parallels between Mandaeism and Jewish mysticism. In the past few years, Mandaean studies has become re-energized thanks to the prodigious efforts of Jorunn Jacobsen Buckley. I seek to make a small contribution to what will hopefully be a renaissance of interest in this often neglected area of study. My own suggestions are only that -suggestions. Many of the parallels and potential polemics which I will identify in the following pages remain on the level of speculation. Rather than stifle my own imagination and the imaginations of others, I have chosen to include such speculative dis-cussion. Even if some of my suggestions prove to be incorrect, I hope that they will nevertheless help to inspire further research into the relationship of Mandaeism and Judaism.

J. Buckley: \"We [Mandaeans and Hasidim] are so similar! The same clothes, the same habits, the same humor -everything! I was amazed! Are they Mandaeans? Are we Jews?\"11 Mediation in Late Antiquity The role of mediating figures in early Judaism has provoked great debate. Many Christian scholars of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries adopted the position that the need for interme-diaries in early Jewish theology differentiated it from Christianity. Ferdinand Weber contrasted the immanent theology of Christian trinitarianism with the \"transcendentism\" of ancient Judaism.12 Weber argued that Judaism must have postulated a transcendent God, since it clearly formulated a number of intermediaries between him and the world. In a scathing review, George Foot Moore criti-cized Weber for his ignorance of the \"history or the content of Christian dogma,\"13 which, for centuries, had emphasized the paral-lels between the Supreme God of Christianity and that of Judaism, and also between the Christian Logos or Son andJewish intermedi-ary figures. Like Weber, Wilhelm Bousset contrasted what he considered to be the immanent theology of Christianity and the transcendent theolo-gy of Judaism.14 Bousset relied heavily on apocalyptic sources for his description of Jewish theology, for which he was roundly criticized by Jewish scholars, who lamented his lack of rabbinic evidence. Although Moore, too, cautioned against painting an accurate por-trait of early Jewish theology from the apocalypses alone, his prima-ry criticism of Bousset was more subtle: even the God of the apoc-alypses was not transcendent, rather, the apocalyptic image of a 11].].

In his zeal to combat what he viewed as the pernicious anti-Jewish sentiment of Weber, Bousset, et. al., Moore downplayed the significance of intermediate figures in early Jewish theology.16 In retrospect, Moore's greatest contribution to the question of interme-diaries in early Jewish theology was his identification and rejection of the polemical orientation of the scholarship which preceded him. Moore's approach to the role of intermediate figures in early Judaism was challenged by several scholars of his own generation. The greatest critics of Moore's views on mediation were W.O.E. Oester1eyl7 and G.H. Box. 18 While Oesterley and Box supported the existence of intermediaries in early Judaism, they did not accept the particular polemical stance of Bousset and Weber. Instead, they came close to reiterating the earlier position of those Christian dog-matists who considered Jewish intermediaries to be an important parallel with Christian figures such as the Son or Logos. Box and Oesterley argued that while early Jewish theology was rich with intermediate figures, later Jewish theology became narrow and restricted: The importance of the doctrines and thought-tendencies which have been passed in review above [concerning mediation], as illustrating the rise and growth of the expression of Christian ideas is obvious; but it should be added that they largely belong to the wider and richer Judaism which has had to give place to the na rower and more restricted Judaism of subsequent times.\" 15 \"Christian Writers onJudaism,\" p. 247. 16 See, for example, \"Intermediaries in Jewish Theology,\" p. 41. 17 W.O.E.

Within Jewish circles, the issue of mediation has also been widely debated. While Saadya, Ibn Ezra, and Maimonides each developed their own doctrines of mediation, other traditional voices rejected the existence of intermediate figures or, at least, attempted to limit their scope and significance.20 AmongJewish scholars ofMoore's era, Joshua Abelson stands out for his opus The Immanence qf God in Rabbinical ]udaismY Abelson responded to those scholars who con-trasted a transcendent God of Judaism with an immanent God of Christianity by stressing that in early Judaism, God was both tran-scendent and immanent, or as he put it: \"Immanence and Transcendence coalesce into one another, component parts of the same whole. \"22 Abelson eliminated the theological necessity for inter-mediate figures in early Judaism by arguing that God was active in the world via manifestations such as the Shekinah or Ruah ha-Qodesh (\"Holy Spirit\"). Abelson's emphasis on the immanence of God in rabbinic litera-ture was criticized by Ephraim Urbach as apologetic and exaggerat-ed.23 Nevertheless, like Abelson, Urbach stressed that the Shekinah was a \"manifestation of the Lord\" and not an hypostasis with a sep-arate existence.24 In support of this position, Urbach cited the work of Gershom Scholem.25 A close examination of Scholem's writings, however, reveals a more complex position than that suggested by Urbach. Although Scholem wrote that in the \"Talmud, midrash, and the Aramaic translations of the Bible,\" the Shekinah was not a distinct hypostasis, he nevertheless described it as \"verging on hypo-statization\". 26 20 On this issue see Judah Goldin's article, \"Not by Means of an Angel and Not by Means of a Messenger,\" in Jacob Neusner, ed., Religions in Antiquity: Essays in Memory qf Erwin Ramsdell Goodenough, Leiden, 1968. 21 Joshua Abelson, 7he Immanence qf God in Rahbinical Judaism, London, 1912 (reprint: New York, 1969). , Ibid., p. 37. \" Ephraim Urbach, 7he Sages, Jerusalem, 1975, p. 41. ,. Ibid., p. 43; pp. 63-64. 25 Although Urbach argued that Scholem's identification of Midrash Proverbs (ninth century) as the first textual source for a hypostatic Shekinah was too early, favoring instead the later work Bereshit Rabba.ti (eleventh century). 26 Gershom Scho1em, On the Mystical Shape qf the Godhead, New York, 1991, pp. 147-148."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"8 CHAPTER ONE Furthermore, while Scholem basically accepted Abelson's assertion of the immanence of God in rabbinic literature, he unequivocally rejected its relevance for Merkabah mysticism. Instead, Scholem adopted the position of Heinrich Graetz that Merkabah mysticism was a ':Judaized form of cosmocratorial mysticism concerning the divine King (or Emperor),\" or \"Basileomorphism\".27 Far from a the-ology of immanence, Scholem argued that: in the Merkabah mysticism with which we are dealing here, the idea of God's immanence plays practically no part at all ..... The fact is that the true and spontaneous feeling of the Merkabah mystic knows nothing of divine immanence; the infinite gulf between the soul and God the King on His throne is not even bridged at the climax of mystical ecstasy. 28 At the symbolic center of the unbreachable gulf between humans and God in Merkabah mysticism, Scholem placed the figure of Metatron or the \"lesser Jaho,\" who functioned as God's vice regent and angelic emissary. 29 In the wake of Scholem's research, many scholars of early Jewish mysticism have focused on the issue of intermediate beings, general-ly concentrating on the figure of Metatron, but also examining other figures, such as the angelic Jacob, the primal Adam, and the divinized Moses.

It should also be emphasized that one should not expect to find identical the-olgical positions in different forms of early Judaism, or because of the polyphonic nature of Jewish literature in general, even within a single genre or text. In regards to Merkabah mysticism, in particu-lar, a growing number of scholars have begun to reject an either or approach, in favor of a model which posits God's transcendence and immanence. As Peter Schafer has argued concerning Hekhalot liter-ature (echoing the earlier view of joshua Abelson regarding rabbinic literature): \"God is transcendent and immanent, at the same time hidden and revealed. \"38 Within Merkabah mysticism, God is frequently depicted as an exalted and highly remote figure. Thus, Scholem was partly right when he described the gulf between humans and God in Merkabah mysticism. Yet, Scholem erred when he emphasized the impossibli-ty of closing this gulf -that is, when he defined the God of Merkabah mysticism as absolutely inaccessible or transcendent. How was the distance between human beings and God breached in Merkabah mysticism? The answer to this question requires an appreciation of the paradoxical nature of the angelic vice regent. In one respect, the angelic vice regent symbolizes the gulf between God and humans; between the divine and physical worlds. Indeed, without such a gulf there would be no need for the mediating func-tions of the angelic vice regent. At the same time, it must also be stressed that the angelic vice regent symbolizes the ability of human beings to breach the distance with God. In this respect, the angelic vice regent serves as a potent symbol of a continuum between human, angelic, and divine existence. Thus, according to the Hekhalot text known as 3 Enoch, the angel-ic vice regent Metatron begins his career as a human, only to be transformed into a supra-angelic being, even a \"lesser YHWH\". qf Intermediation and t1ze Origin qf Gnosticism, Tiibingen, 1985. \" The Hidden and Manifest God, p. 150.

Ishmael on his own journey through the hekhalot or heavenly palaces. Although 3 Enoch portrays God as distant and exalted (after all, God lies at the end of a very long heavenly journey), God is not transcendent or inaccessible. Rather than keeping R. Ishmael and God apart, Metatron enables his human charge to achieve one of the most poignant and intimate visions of God preserved in any work of Jewish literature: R. Ishmael said: Metatron said to me: Come and I will show you the right hand of the Omnipresent One, which has been banished behind him because of the destruction of the Temple. From it all kinds of brilliant lights shine, and by it the 955 heavens were created. Even the seraphim and the ophanim are not allowed to look on it, till the day of salvation comes. I went with him, and, taking me by his hand, he bore me up on his wings and showed it to me ..... Then the right hand of the Omnipresent One wept, and five rivers of tears flowed from its five fingers, and, falling into the Great Sea, made the whole world quake. 39 By virtue of Metatron's mediation R. Ishmael is granted a vision of God prohibited to the seraphim and the ophanim. The underlying message of the episode is that while God's mercy in the world (sym-bolized by God's right hand) is temporarily restrained, God still loves Israel, and has even empowered an angelic intermediary (the vice regent, Metatron) to bring his worthiest children to him, as it were, even if he cannot or will not come to them. Thus far I have concentrated on the issue of mediation in early Judaism and, in particular, in Merkabah mysticism. Mediating fig-ures also occupy a significant place in Gnosticism and Mandaeism. Indeed, without such figures the essential drama of Gnostic and Mandaean mythology would be impossible. The antipodal processes which drive the motor of these systems are creation and salvation. Both require intermediate figures such as the demiurge and the sav-iour. Vice regent figures in Gnosticism and Mandaeism reign over the space and time between creation and salvation. These interstitial roles are reflected in ambivalent characters. Thus angelic vice regent figures in Gnosticism and Mandaeism possess demiurgical and salvif-ic characteristics. \" 3 Enoch 48A, as cited in P. S.

In his book, Two Powers in Heaven, Segal theorizes that originally ditheistic or binitari-an proto-Gnostics were radicalized as a result of \"the battle between the rabbis, the Christians and various other <two powers' sectarians who inhabited the outskirts if Judaism [emphasis in original]. \"45 Early or proto-Gnostics attacked the god of the Hebrew Bible by depicting him as a lower deity, a kind of reverse image of the angel-ic vice regent. Although he was depicted as the true god's enemy, the Gnostic demiurge resembled the angelic vice regent in many respects. He functioned as the creator and ruler of the physical world and as a de facto guardian of the divine realm, although in this case, he attempted to prevent all human beings from ascending to 40 Quispel, \"The Demiurge in the Apocryphon of John,\" in Nag Hammadi and Gnosis, ed.

Some Gnostics divided the biblical god into two figures -one, an evil or ignorant demiurge (Ialdabaoth) and two, a vice regent who opposed the demiurge and served the high god of the Pleroma (Sabaoth). As we will see, this is the relationship between the demiurge Ialdabaoth and his wayward son, Sabaoth, in a number of Gnostic texts from the Nag Hammadi Library. The transformation of the God of the Hebrew Bible into one or more lower figures suggests that Gnosticism understood itself to be in competition with Judaism and Christianity or, phrased different-ly, that it saw itself as a corrective to these traditions. This observa-tion raises another issue which will be central to the present work. On the one hand, Mandaean, Gnostic, and Jewish vice regent tra-ditions have many parallels, reflecting (as I will argue in the next chapter) structural similarities as well as a common literary and exegetical heritage. On the other hand, there is evidence that these movements employed their respective vice regent myths for polemi-cal purposes, either to undermine parallel figures in competing tra-ditions or to undermine other cosmological and theological beliefs which were associated with these vice regent figures."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO MYTH AND EXEGESIS The angelic vice regent is a mythological figure. For a long time, scholars downplayed or even rejected the significance of myth in both rabbinic Judaism and Merkabah mysticism. 1 As recent studies have shown, however, the imaginative world of late antiquejudaism provided fertile ground for mythological speculation.2 By contrast, scholars have long appreciated myth as an important if not defining feature of Gnosticism and Mandaeism. In this chapter, I will situate the angelic vice regent within the broader study of myth. I will also examine the important role which exegesis plays in the construction of the different versions of the myth of the angelic vice regent. Two schools of thought in particular have influenced my observations on myth -the history of religions approach developed by Mircea Eliade and the structuralist model of myth formulated by Claude Levi-Strauss. While both methodologies have their weaknesses, one of their common strengths is an ability to illuminate the significance of mediation in mythical thought. One of the goals of this study is to further explore the relationship between Merkabah mysticism, Gnosticism, and Mandaeism on the basis of their shared mythologoumena. If the mythologies of Gnosticism, Mandaeism and Merkabah mysticism are like jigsaw puzzles, then one of the most important pieces in each puzzle is the angelic vice regent. The similar profiles of the angelic vice regents in these religious movements reflects two major factors: a shared logic and a common body of traditions. \" Levi-Strauss' goal in his far reaching studies has been \"to define each myth by the set (ensemble) of all its versions.\"3 The encyclope-1 I have examined the debate over this issue in The Gnostzc Imaginatwn, pp. 4-17. 2 For example, Michael Fish bane, \"The 'Measures' of God's Glory in the Ancient Mjdrash\" in Messiah and Christos: Studies in the Jewish Origins of Christiamry, Tubingen, 1992; Elliot Wolfson, \"Visionary Ascent and Enthronement in the Hekhalot Literature\" in Through a Speculum that Shines: Vision and Imagznation in Medieval Jewish Mysticism, Princeton, 1994; G.

My own enterprise is less ambitious. Instead of exhaustively examining the ensemble of transformations of the myth of the angelic vice regent, I seek to define its basic structure or morphology and to comparatively examine three representative examples of this mythological type. Myths are narratives about etiologies and origins. Their characters are divine or semi-divine figures whose actions become paradigmat-ic for human beings. The angelic vice regent functions as a mytho-logical figure in a number of ways. He is frequently associated with the creation of the world, either as a demiurgic figure, himself, or as a close associate of the demiurge. As we will see, his story of trans-formation is a model for human beings to imitate. The message of his tale, like that of other myths, is the possibility of commerce. between human and divine beings. The morphology of the angelic vice regent is as follows: 1. Demiurgical function 2. Guardian of the gate (the abode of God) 3. Ruler (of human and/or angelic beings) 4. Judge 5. Priest 6. Hypostatic form of the divine anthropos 7. Composite or hybrid ontology (has characteristics of God, human, angel). The glue which binds these elements is the logic of mediation. Although not every angelic vice regent figure exhibits all of these characteristics, each figure exhibits many of them. In this respect, my approach draws on a body of scholarship concerning another mythological figure: the trickster. As William Hynes has written: \"a number of shared char-acteristics appear to cluster together in a pattern that can serve as an index to the presence of the trickster ..... Not every trickster nec-essarily has all of these characteristics. Still, more times than not, a specific trickster will exhibit many of these similarities.\" Hynes and others have suggested employing shared characteristics as a matrix by which to survey all known examples of tricksters and to judge their degree of \"tricksterness.\"4 Mircea Eliade's form of religious phenomenology is sometimes contrasted with structuralism.5 Yet there is much in common be-• William Hynes, \"Mapping the Characteristics of Mythic Tricksters: A Heuristic Guide,\" in William J. Hynes and William Doty, eds., Mythical Trickster Figures: Contours, Contexts, and Criticisms, Tuscaloosa and London, 1993. 5 Two exceptions areJ.Z. Smith and Ugo Bianchi who have both noted the mor-phological nature of Eliade's work. See, J. Z.

As the guardian of the gate (i.e. the portal between the physical world and the divine realm) the angelic vice regent oversees what Eliade calls a: frontier that distinguishes and opposes two worlds ~ and at the same time the paradoxical place where those worlds communicate, where passage from the profane to the sacred world becomes possi-ble..... The threshold, the door show the solution of continuity in space immediately and concretely; hence their great religious impor-tance, for they are symbols and at the same time vehicles of passage from the one space to the other.' J. Z. Smith adds that this \"point of communication ..... is repeatable by man.\"9 It is therefore not surprising that the angelic vice regent oversees the passage of human beings from this world to the realm of God, where in Merkabah mysticism, Gnosticism, and Mandaeism the successful individual is spiritually and physically transformed through a process of angelification or divinization.10 The model for this process is the vice regent himself, whose ontological ambiguity symbolizes the potential transition from one mode of existence to another, and who, in the case of Metatron has undergone a process of angelif1cation, himself.

And as Mary Douglas argues in Purity and Danger, a thing which confuses categories can be dangerous.12 Awareness of the hybrid character of the angel-ic vice regent sheds new light on the most famous episode involving the angelic vice regent Metatron. Figures involved in \"interstructur-al activities and liminal situations\" are often exempt from standard taboos. 13 Metatron has been given permission to sit down by God, that is, the taboo of angels sitting in heaven has been suspended. When Elisha unwittingly witnesses the breaking of this taboo, he is quite naturally confused and this confusion leads him to heresy: indentifying Metatron as a \"second power\" or god in heaven. The angelic vice regent thus poses a challenge to what Louis Dumont has called homo hierarchicus. 14 He is betwixt and between a great number of hierarchical categories: world/pleroma; man/god; sacred/pro fane. Ihe Trickster: Shadow qf the Vice Regent My analysis of the angelic vice regent has been influenced by the rich body of scholarship concerning the trickster. Unlike Jung's work on the trickster, my goal is not to define the angelic vice regent as a universal archetype, representing a particular stage of human con-sciousness. 15 Instead, I share Robert Pelton's view that \"the trickster is not an archetypal Idea, but a symbolic pattern that, like the High God or the Divine Mother, includes a wide range of individual fig-ures.\"16 \"Victor Turner, 7he Forest if Symbols: Aspects if Ndembu Ritual, Ithaca and London, 1967, p. 95.

As Levi-Strauss writes concerning the trickster: \"Since his mediating function occupies a position halfWay between polar terms, he must retain something of that duality -namely an ambiguous and equivocal character.\"24 Metatron, an angelic vice regent, and Hermes, a trickster, are depicted as at once old men and youth.25 Just as Metatron is portrayed as a human being transformed into a supra-angelic figure, so the trickster is \"less than a god but more than a human-not god but 'a god who is not god'.26 The key hermeneutical issue for studying both the angelic vice regent and the trickster therefore becomes what Mac Linscott Ricketts has described as the need to penetrate the \"kind of logic [that] combines all these disparate elements into one mythical personality.\"27 The interstitial character of both angelic vice regent and trickster is reflected in the liminal spatial position they frequently occupy, namely, at the threshold or boundary of the divine and physical worlds.

From this position, both trickster and angelic vice regent act as agents of mediation between the divine and physical worlds, or as Karl Kerenyi has written concerning the trickster: \"messenger and mediator ..... [a] hoverer-between worlds who dwells in a world of his own\". 29 Because of the trickster's mediating nature, ambiguity, and multi valence, Victor Turner has depicted the trickster as a liminal figure.30 Indeed, Robert Pelton has gone so far as to call the trickster a \"per-sonified limen, or a \"symbol of the liminal state itself and of its per-manent accessibility as a source of recreative power.\"31 This creative power does not derive entirely from the trickster's ability to mediate or synthesize binary oppositions (a la Levi-Strauss). Instead, Karl Kerenyi's important observation that the trickster is \"the spirit of dis-order, the enemy of boundaries,\" must be added to Levi-Strauss' emphasis on the synthesis of distinctions. 32 Like carnival, whose sym-bolic inversion of hierarchy actually serves to reinforce or reconsti-tute the same hierarchy, the trickster breaks taboos in order to reif)r already existing boundaries or, even, to create new ones.33 Similarly, the angelic vice regent reinforces or establishes new boundaries by initially disrupting or challenging them. For example, the Mandaean vice regent Abathur ruptures the lower boundary of the world of light by gazing below into the \"black waters\". This rebellious act results in the establishment of the physical universe and the stratification of the boundary between this world and the world of light. In Jewish sources, Metatron challenges the boundary between divine and angelic natures by remaining seated when Aher encounters him. Metatron's behavior causes Aher to speculate on the possible existence of two divinities. Ultimately, however, Metatron's disruption of the heavenly order serves as an opportunity to rein-force the boundary between God and his chief angeL Finally, the Gnostic vice regent Sabaoth's rebellion against his evil father Ialdabaoth actually serves to clarify rather than blur the boundary between the forces of good and evil.

The trickster \"enters the human world to make things happen, to recreate boundaries..... Then he returns to that hidden threshold which he embodies and makes available as a passage\".34 Both trick-ster and angelic vice regent symbolize the ability of human beings to pass between sacred and profane modes of being. While reinforcing the existence of boundaries, the trickster and angelic vice regent also symbolize the elasticity, even permeability of the same boundaries. Like the trickster, the angelic vice regent is \"at once an agent of dis-ruption and an agent of reconciliation.\"35 For example, the Mandaean figure Abathur sets into motion the creation of the phys-ical world by rebelliously gazing below the Pleroma, but, afterwards, he actively functions to restore the unity of the Pleroma by weigh-ing human souls and restoring those found worthy to their plero-matic home. Like a bricoleur, the angelic vice regent destroys or transforms existing structures in order to create new ones. Trickster and angel-ic vice regent, alike, are frequently portrayed as demiurgic figures. Related to his demiurgical function, the angelic vice regent is some-times depicted as the hypostatic divine phallus. This phallic quality is also a common feature of trickster figures like Hermes, who is often portrayed ithyphallicaly. 36 As might be guessed, the relationship of the trickster and the high god is one of great ambivalence. The trickster is often portrayed as a rival of the high god. 37 Frequently, the trickster attempts to imitate or usurp the unique powers of the high god. 38 Yet, the trickster can also be the high god's accomplice or collaborator.39 Indeed, the West Mrican trickster Eshu is depicted as the \"marshal\" of the divine court. 4D Paul Radin suggests two mythological etiologies for the \"' Mythical Trickster Figures, p. 60. 35 The Trickster in West Africa, p. 7 5. 36 Mythical Trickster Figures, p. 48. 37 Ibid., p. 27, \"He [the trickster] is ..... the High God's accomplice and his rival.\" 38 On the trickster's tendency to imitate the High God, cf William Hynes, \"Mapping the Characteristics of the Mythic Tricksters: A Heuristic Guide,\" pp. 33; 41, and Christopher Vecsey, \"The Exception Who Proves the Rules: Ananse the Akan Trickster,\" p. 113, in Mythical Trickster Figures: Contours, Contexts, and Criticisms. 39 On the characterization of the trickster as the High God's accomplice, cf. n. 29, supra.

Either the trickster represents a human hero who was transformed and elevated to the rank of a semi-deity, or, conversely, a deity who was displaced and demoted to the rank of semi-deity by the high god.41 In both scenarios, the trickster competes and/or collaborates with the high god. The angelic vice regent also has an ambivalent relationship with the high god. Like the trickster, the angelic vice regent frequendy imitates the high god (e.g. Metatron's sitting; Abathur's procreative activity). This mimetic behaviour brings the angelic vice regent into conflict with the high god since it undermines his uniqueness. Nevertheless, the angelic vice regent also helps the high god by mediating between him and the physical world. Finally, like the trickster, the angelic vice regent is sometimes depicted as a trans-formed human hero (Metatron), a demoted deity (Abathur), or a combination of the two (Sabaoth). The identification of the African trickster Eshu as marshal of the divine court raises another parallel between the trickster and the angelic vice regent. Indeed, in the case of Eshu, the boundary between trickster and angelic vice regent is blurred, since the role of marshal is extremely close to that of vice regent. Eshu's position, while not accorded to the majority of tricksters, highlights the impor-tant role of the trickster within the divine court or hierarchy. Unlike Eshu, however, most tricksters are shadow members of the divine hierarchy, rather than officially empowered figures. During the medieval period and later, the trickster figure became a significant member of the court, both as a literary trope, and, in the guise of the jester, in the actual courts of European royalty. In both contexts, the human trickster evinced the same ambivalent rela-tionship with the king that his mythological brother shared with the high god. 42 Officially, the purpose of the court fool or jester was to entertain. Unofficially, however, the jester cynically challenged the king's authority by way of farce and imitation, and also served the collaborative function of mediating beween the king and his audi-ence by comically evaluating or judging the individuals who came to see the king.

The same ambivalence which governs the relationship between the angelic vice regent and the high god also governs the relationship between the human vice regent and the king. Both human and angelic vice regents are fre-quently guilty of imitating the ruler or usurping his power and authority. Yet, both angelic and human vice regents perform a number of necessary collaborative and mediating functions. Thus, trickster and vice regent are both subversive and collaborative -at once undermining and helping the ruler. Although angelic vice regents and tricksters have much in com-mon, the categories should not be conflated.

By contrast, the trickster almost always operates from a position of unofficial authority within the hierarchy, even when he appears as the court fool, whose official function is to entertain, not mediate between the king and his subjects. Because of his permanently unstable position within the official hierarchy, the trickster must consistently rely on cunning and trick-ery in mediating between the gods and humanity (ala Prometheus).44 By contrast, the angelic vice regent, due to his official empowerment and position, is not definitively tricky, although he may rely on trick-ery when other means of achieving a goal fail.45 In relation to one another, therefore, the angelic vice regent and trickster are like mir-ror images.

Among the most important sources for Gnostic and Mandaean myths are the events and figures in the Hebrew Bible. Far from devaluing the Hebrew Bible as was previously thought, it has become clear that Gnostics employed biblical exegesis as one of the primary means for generating their own mythological systems. 47 Thus, exegetical transformations were often mythological transfor-mations, as well.

Although Edwin Yamauchi downplays the influence of Judaism on Mandaeism in general, he admits that \"the Mandaeans' knowledge of the Old Testament was more extensive -if not more intensive -than that of many Gnostics whose knowledge seems not to have exceeded the prediluvian section of Genesis.\"51 In fact, it is my contention that Mandaean and Gnostic authors -like their Jewish counterparts-transformed mythological material in biblical and apocalyptic texts into new myths of vice regent figures. These mythopoetic transformations indicate that Gnostics and Mandaeans shared a broader knowledge of Jewish literary sources then general-ly acknowledged. Gershom Scholem frequently downplayed the importance of both myth and exegesis in Merkabah mysticism. According to Scholem, the most representative Merkabah texts \"are precisely those which are almost entirely free from the exegetical element.\"52 Scholem also wrote that Merkabah texts are \"essentially descriptions of a genuine religious experience for which no sanction is sought in the Bible.\"53 Nevertheless, Scholem acknowledged that Merkabah mysticism drew on biblical literature for its images and \"basic categories of thought\".54 Scholem's equivocation on this issue reflects a profound ambivalence about how to characterize Merkabah mysticism, a topic I have examined in great detail elsewhere. 55 Recent studies have emphasized the significant presence of myth and exegesis -and the link between them -in Merkabah myst-cism. If, as a number of scholars have argued, apocalypticism rep-resents a secondary explosion of myth, then Gnosticism, Mandaeism, and Merkabah mysticism may be described as branches of a tertiary explosion.56 Not only did these movements refigure ancient Near 50 See Fossum's statement of purpose in \"Gen. 1,26 and 2, 7 in Judaism, Samaritanism, and Gnosticism,\" p. 202, \"The scope of this paper is to restore an ancient Jewish haggada on Gen. l, 26 and trace its subsequent development.\" 51 E.

The critical role of exegesis in the development of angelic vice regent traditions reflects a general trend in late antique angelology. As Saul Olyan writes: \"Exegesis is at least a major aspect, if not the most significant com-ponent, of the elusive framework sought by scholars in order better to understand the development of ideas about angels in late biblical and post-biblical texts.\"57 In most cases, the relationship between late antique vice regent myths and earlier Jewish literary sources is not indicated by the explicit citation of a biblical or apocalyptic text. Instead, the formu-lation of angelic vice regent traditions in Gnosticism, Mandaeism, and Merkabah mysticism often reflects what Michael Fishbane has called \"implicit\" or \"virtual\" exegesis, or what Carol Newsome has referred to as \"traditional-historical'' transformations.58 According to Fishbane, where the explicit citation of a biblical lemma is absent, the identification of implicit exegesis depends on two basic criteria: 1. \"multiple and sustained lexical linkages\" between two texts. 2. The lexical reorganization and topical rethematization of an ear-lier text (the traditum) by a later text (the traditio). Drawing on Fishbane's work, Newsome has suggested that in some cases, the relationship is better described as traditional-historical, rather than exegetical. Newsom illustrates this distinction in her work on Merkabah exegesis in the Qlmran Sabbath Shirot: I would, for instance, identifY I Enoch 14 and Daniel 7 as tradition-histor-ical developments of Ezekiel's merkabah visions but not exegetica transfor-mations of Ezekiel. In these passages certain motifs from Ezekiel's descrip-tion of the divine throne chariot are combined with other traditions about the heavenly seat, the divine council, etc. in order to create a picture of the heavenly court. In neither case, however, are there \"multiple and sustained lexical linkages\" with the text of Ezekiel. The most striking exegetical transformation shared by Jewish, Gnostic, and Mandaean vice regent traditions is that the enthroned figure in Daniel 7:9-10 has now become a prototype for the angelic vice regent. This move -common to all three religions -is sig-nificant because in the biblical text, the enthroned Ancient of Days 57 Saul Olyan, A Thousand Thousands Served Him· Exegesis and the Naming of Angels in AncientJudaism, Tubingen, 1993, p. 11. 58 Michael Fish bane, Biblzcal Interpretation in Anczent Israel, Oxford, 1985, pp. 285ff.

The following chapters will focus on Metatron in rabbinic and Hekhalot texts, material which strad-dles the border between Late Antiquity and the early medieval peri-od. Peter Schafer has made great strides in both assembling the Hekhalot manuscripts and analyzing the stages in their composition and redaction. Schafer has redefined the study of Hekhalot literature by focusing on the issue of literary development, proposing a stage by stage series of compositions and redactions instead of an early, defining period of composition and codification. 1 Schafer has con-cluded that to speak of \"texts\" let alone \"Urtexts\" is an erroneous assumption in the Hekhalot literature. Instead, smaller literary units were composed and redacted along a time line of hundreds of years. 2 Opinions concerning the historical mileu for the composition and redaction of the Hekhalot literature have ranged from Graetz, who posited a post-Islamic setting,3 to Scholem, who argued for a Tannaitic or early Amoraic date of composition,4 and set the authors of the Hekhalot literature \"near the center of rabbinic Judaism, not on its fringes,\" due to the \"Halakhic\" character of the Hekhalot lit-erature.5 1 See especially Schafer's essays \"Tradition and Redaction in Hekhalot Literature,\" Heklw1ot-Studien, Tubingen, 1988, pp. 8-16 and \"The Problem of Compositional Identity of 'Hekhalot Rabbati',\" Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought Vol. 6, I, 1987, pp. 1-12. According to Schafer, it is dubious to speak of Hekhalot texts, such as Hekhalot Rabbati or Ma'aseh Merkabah, per se (see, \"Tradition and Redaction,\" p. 15). Instead, the manuscripts as we have them can be most accu-rately broken down into smaller literary units. Schafer also criticizes the search for \"Urtexts\" or \"Urforms\" which he thinks begs the question, since original texts may not have existed at all. Michael Swartz has applied this compositional theory to the text Ma'aseh Merkabah, in his book, Mystical Prayer in Ancient Judaism: An Ana{ysis qf Ma'aseh Merkabah, Tubingen, 1991. 2 Although Scholem accepted that the Hekhalot literature developed in stages, he was also convinced that at the basis of the Hekhalot tradition were original texts.

I will not attempt to provide a comprehensive treatment of Metatron in these sources. Instead my goal is to show how the texts in which Metatron appears reflect two opposing tendencies within Merkabah mysticism. The first tendency seeks to destabalize, blur, or even eliminate the ontological and functional boundaries between human, angelic, and divine beings. The second tendency is to enforce or to polemically re-assert these boundaries, thereby pro-ducing passages which embody the unbreachable gulf between human beings and God mentioned by Gershom Scholem. The fig-ure of the angelic vice regent is at the center of this crucial debate and may be said to mediate between the two positions. I will first examine those Merkabah traditions which depict the angelic vice regent as a figure who calls into question the impermeability of dif-ferent categories of being(s). Metatron as Divine Man The importance of temples in the ancient Near East cannot be over-estimated. They were at once cosmic and cultural centers. In soci-eties from Babylonia to Greece, temples were understood to be no less than bridges between the heavens and the earth. Likewise, the cadres of priests devoted to the upkeep and function of these sacred spaces were empowered as living conduits between divine and human beings. For a temple to be destroyed was a cataclysmic event for the people who worshipped within its precincts. The trauma becomes more understandable to modern readers when we appreci-6 See P.S. Alexander, \"The Historical Setting of the Hebrew Book of Enoch,\" Journal qf]ewish Studies 28, 1977, p.

When this connection was violent-ly severed, an entire culture felt a shock comparable to being torn from the womb, an image which captures the reaction of the ancient Israelites to the destruction of the First Temple in Jerusalem. The impact of the destruction of the Second Temple on late antique Jewish culture has long been debated. Some scholars have argued that the destruction of the Temple was the primary catalyst for the development of rabbinic Judaism. Out of the ashes of 70 CE, a new religious and cultural edifice emerged. Instead of a building made of stones and mortar, the rabbis built a discursive structure consisting of text (the Tanakh) and exegesis (midrash). Within this new context, pilgrimage consisted of re-visiting the Bible and offer-ing one's own interpretations upon the altar of the text. As Jacob Neusner has written, in place of the temple, works like the Mishnah allowed Israel \"to experience anywhere and anytime that cosmic center of the world\".7 Other scholars have argued, however, that even before 70 CE, a cultural shift occurred in the Mediterranean world away from loca-tive religious structures, such as temples, and towards more anthro-pocentric models of religious expression which focused on charis-matic religious figures. 8 The destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem thus gave concrete expression to a cultural process already under-way. The increased focus on messianic figures and \"divine men\" in Late Antiquity is evidence of such a transition, with Jesus serving as the best known example of this phenomenon. Rather than arguing for a complete contrast between these forms of religiousity, I would like to suggest that both before and after 70 CE, groups within Judaism combined locative, exegetical, and anthropocentric elements in their practice and ideology. The Dead 7 Jacob Neusner, \"Map Without Territory; Mishnah's System of Sacrifice and Sanctuary,\" History qf Religions 19, 1977, 186. 8 J.Z. Smith, writes in \"Earth and Gods,\" Map is Not Territory, 128, \"if the Temple had not been destroyed, it would have had to be neglected. For it represented a locative type of religious activity no longer perceived as effective in a new, utopian religious situation with a concomitant shift from a cosmological to an anthropolog-ical view-point.\" In other writings, Smith has qualified this position by adding that not all locative religious structures were eliminated in Late Antiquity. See, for exam-ple, \"The Temple and the Magician,\" in ibid., p. 186, \"But I believe that a more complex model is called for -one that might better account for a large class of cultic phenomena that exhibit characteristics of mobility, what I would term reli-gious entrepeneurship and which represent both a reinterpretation and a reaffir-mation of native, locative, celbratory categories of religious practice and thought.\""},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"30 CHAPTER THREE Sea Scrolls reflect this cluster of elements, with their focus on mes-sianic figures, the presence of a charismatic leader (the Teacher of Righteousness), an intense but critical interest in the Temple in Jerusalem, and the beginnings of midrashic type exegesis.9 Early Christianity also reflects this combination of topoi. Peter Brown has written that \"In the popular imagination, the emergence of the holy man at the expense of the temple marks the end of the classical world.\"10 Yet, the New Testament actually reinscribes the impor-tance of the temple as a religious category in a number of ways, including Paul's description of the body as a temple (where the image of the divine man and the temple are organically integrated), the eschatological role of the heavenly temple, and even Jesus' con-demnation of the contemporary Temple which nevertheless reflects his devotion to the sanctity of the institution. Finally, rabbinic liter-ature and, in particular, the Mishnah, is notable for its discussion of laws and traditions concerning the Temple, despite the fact that this literature was produced years after the Temple's physical destruc-tion. All of these examples highlight the degree to which the Temple functioned as a conceptual category as much as an actual physical place of worship. Thus, even if the Temple no longer existed as a site of pilgrimage and sacrifice, it continued to exert great influence on the religious imagination in Late Antiquity. One of the chief ways the Temple was reconceptualized in late antique Judaism was the development of the heavenly temple. This phenomenon may be traced to the period before the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem and is intimately linked to the apocalyptic focus on the heavens, their angelic inhabitants, and contents.11 The heavenly temple also became the locus of a new form of pilgrimage -the heavenly ascent -a theme which runs from apocalyptic works to the later Merkabah material. 12 Within the heavenly temple the role of the high priest was filled by an angelic or semi-divine figure, whose identity differed depend-ing on the particular community or text. Michael, Melchizedek, Akatriel, Jesus, and Metatron were each described as high priests in 9 On these issues, see B.

In the Shiur Qomah literature, we find mention of the mishkan ha-na)ar or \"the tabernacle of the Youth [i.e. Metatron]\". One of the most striking references appears in the midrashic collection called Numbers Rabbah, where Metatron is described as follows: When the Holy One, blessed be He, told Israel to set up the taber-nacle, he intimated to the ministering angels that they should also construct a tabernacle. And when one was erected below, the other was erected on high. The latter was the tabernacle of the Youth, whose name is Metatron, and there he offers up the souls of the righteous to atone for Israel in the days of their exile.

Smith has written that \"Rather than celebration, purification and pilgrimage, the new rituals will be those of conver-sion, of initiation into the secret society or identification with the divine man.\"15 Although some movements in Late Antiquity reflect the transition mentioned by Smith, others, including Merkabah mys-ticism, combine elements of both modes of religiousity (as well as an 13 On the well attested tradition of Michael as the high priest, c£ BT Hagigah l2b, Menahoth !lOa, and Zebahim 62a.

Although Metatron is an angelic being, he is also a species of divine man insofar as he represents a transformed or angelified human being: the biblical figure Enoch.17 Esoteric speculation regarding Enoch was inspired by the Bible's laconic and mysterious account: \"Enoch walked with God; then he was no more, for God took him.\" [Gen. 5:24] Apocalyptic sources contain a number of ref-erences to Enoch's heavenly apotheosis or angelification. In I Enoch 71, Enoch is addressed as the Son of Man, thereby implying that he has undergone a process of spiritual and/ or physical transformation, per-haps even angelification or semi-divinization.18 As Alan Segal writes: \"This is an extraordinarily important event, as it underlines the importance of mystic transformation between the adept and the angelic vice-regent of God.\"19 II Enoch 22:8 explicitly describes the 16 On the importance of exegesis m Merkabah mysticism, see The Gnostic Imagination, pp. 56-67. n On the transformation of Enoch into Metatron cf., Moshe Idel, \"Enoch is Metatron,\" pp. 156-157 and Charles Mopsik, Le Livre hibreu d'Hinoch au Lime des palais, Paris, 1989, pp. 55, 210.

Because of his late dating of I Enoch 37-71 ~ate, third century) and II Enoch (ninth or tenth century) and a number of other reasons (supposed dependency on Muslim Hermetic tradi-tions, etc.), Milik goes so far as to date 3 Enoch to the thirteenth century, a position he supports by citing Scholem's work on the Kabbalah. On p. 127, Milik writes \"Moreover, recent research into the origins of the Cabbala in Western Europe, in particular the work of G. G.

P. S.

The tradition of Enoch as a scribe goes back to I Enoch 15 and Jubilees 4:23, where Enoch is con-ducted \"into the Garden of Eden in majesty and honor, and behold there he writes down the condemnation and judgement of the world, and all the wickedness of the children of men.\""},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"34 CHAPTER THREE declares \"I am Enoch, the son of] ared. When the generation of the Flood sinned and turned to evil deeds ..... the Holy One, blessed be he, took me from their midst to be a witness against them in the heavenly height ..... And the Holy One, blessed be he, appointed me in the height as a prince and a ruler among the ministering angels.' As a type of divine man, Metatron functions as the archetypal ini-tiate and pilgrim as well as the model for angelification. Likewise, as the heavenly high priest, Metatron serves as the mythological proto-type of Merkabah mystics such as Rabbi Ishmael.22 Metatron's role as a high priest highlights the functional parallel between the angel-ic vice regent and the human mystic (both are priests), whereas his transformation from a human being into an angel reflects an onto-logical process which may be repeated by mystics via their own enthronement and angelification. 23 Metatron signifies the resistance of some sources within the Merkabah genre to a binary ontology. Instead of a hard and fast division between human and angelic existence, Enoch-Metatron points to a more fluid ontological and functional continuum. Of course, it may be argued that the true division within Merkabah \" For example, in 3 Enoch 2, where Metatron describes Ishmael as \"of the fami-ly of Aaron, who the Holy One, blessed be He, chose to minister in His presence and on whose head He himself placed the priestly crown on Sinai.\" Although there is a rabbinic tradition (BT Ket. 105b, BT Hull. 49a, etc.) that R. Ishmael was of priestly descent, he could not have been the \"official\" high priest in Jerusalem (as implied by BT Ber. 7a) since he was only a child when the Temple was destroyed in 70 C.E. Morray:Jones, \"Transformational Mysticism in the Apocalyptic-Merkabah Tradition,\" Journal qf Jewish Studies 43, 1992, pp. 20-21, writes, \"When taking part in the celestial liturgy, the adept acts as the representative of the peo-ple before God, as well as being commissioned to declare what has been revealed to him. In other words, he performs a function analogous to that of the High Priest of the Temple. A passage [Synapse §§147-149] found in some versions of Hekhalot Rabbati indicates that the adept, here typified by Metatron-as-Enoch, has taken over the priestly function of atonement.\" The high priestly function of Enoch in the heavenly Temple is asserted in Jubilees 4:25. For the explicit identification between Metatron as the heavenly high priest and R. Ishmael as his earthly counterpart, c£ 2 Legends qf the Martyrs, \"I have a servant ('ebed) on earth as you are my servant on high. His splendour corresponds to your splendour and his appearance corresponds to your appearance.\" (BH. vi. 19-36).

Wolfson, Through a Speculum that Shines, p. 12, \"the enthronement of the mys-tic Un Hekhalot sources] should be understood as a form of quasi-deification or angelification, in line with the older tradition expressed in apocalyptic literature con-cerning the transformation of individuals into angelic beings.\""},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"IN PRAISE OF METATRON 35 mysticism existed between God and all of his creatures, including angels. Even this model must be qualified in light of Metatron, how-ever, who not only blurs the boundaries between human and angel-ic beings but, as I will show in the next section, between angelic and divine existence. Metatron as Divine Angel Along with his roles as heavenly high priest and angelified hwnan being, Metatron was sometimes portrayed as a kind of second -albeit junior -deity. 24 The textual traditions which combined to create the image of Metatron as a \"lesser YHWH\" include biblical, apocalyptic, and Merkabah material. In a number of passages, the Bible refers to an Angel of the Lord or malakh YHWH, who is sent by God into the world to act as his representative or emissary (cf. Judg·. 13:3; Gen. 16:7). Perhaps the best known, and in terms of Metatron, the most important of these biblical references is Exodus 23:20-22: I am sending an angel before you to guard you on the way and to bring you to the place that I have prepared. Pay head to him [lit. 'his face'] and obey him. Do not rebel against him, for he will not pardon your offenses, since My Name is in him. But if you obey him and do all that I say, I will be an enemy to your enemies and a foe to your foes. The tradition of an angelic being who embodies the name of God continued within apocalyptic sources such as the Apocalypse qf Abraham, a document which only survives in Slavonic but probably stems from the first or the beginning of the second century. In chap-ter ten of the work, Abraham's heavenly guide declares: \"I am called Y ahoel by Him who moves that which exists with me on the sev-,. Peter Hyman has argued that the Bible reflects a \"dualistic pattern in which two divine entities are presupposed: one the supreme creator God, the other his vizier or prime minister, or some other spiritual agency, who really 'runs the show', or at least provides the point of contact between God and humanity.\" Peter Hyman, \"Monotheism-A Misused Word in jewish Studies?\" Journal of Jewish Studies XLII, 1991, p. 2. Hyman argues that \"most varieties ofjudaism\" reflect this dualistic pat-tern, which itself is an outgrowth of old Canaanite patterns of Canaanite multiple divinities. In Hyman's opinion, the monotheistic theology of Deuteronomy reflects the views of a small party of priests and scribes, what Morton Smith, Palestinian Parties and Politics that Shaped the Old Testament, London, 1987, called \"The Yahweh Alone Party\"."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"36 CHAPTER THREE enth expanse on the firmament, a power in virtue of the ineffable name which is dwelling in me.\" This statement is followed by a description of Y ahoel which draws on the anthropomorphic images of God in both Daniel 7:9 and Ezekiel 1 :26-28: \"the appearance of his [Yahoel's] body was like sapphire, and the look of his counte-nance like chrysolite, and the hair of his head like snow, and the tur-ban upon his head like the appearance of a rainbow\". 25 There are a number of important parallels between Yahoel and Metatron.26 Yahoel's relationship with Abraham in the Apocafypse qf Abraham is analogous to Metatron's relationship with R. Ishmael in the Hekhalot tract 3 Enoch. Both figures serve as heavenly guides, protectors, and agents of revelation. Like Metatron, Yahoel is linked with the high priesthood, in this case, via the turban (c£ Ex. 28:4) which Yahoel wears.27 Finally, as emphasized by Scholem, both 1\\tfetatron and Y ahoel were known by the epithet \"The Lesser YHWH,\" a name which also found its way into Gnostic and Mandaean literature. 28 The explicit identification of Metatron with the Angel of the Lord in Ex. 23 appears in 3 Enoch 12, where Metatron declares that God \"called me the Lesser YHWH in the presence of His heavenly household; as it is written (Ex. 23:21), 'For My name is in him.\"' From the available evidence, it appears that Yahoel and Metatron developed separately but, at some point, Metatron \"absorbed the originally idependent angel Yahoel.\"29 Indeed, in 3 Enoch 48D: 1 25 Apocalypse of Abraham ch.

This text depicts a cosmic judge and weigher of souls. The identity of this figure is unclear because the text describes him in imagery that could indicate God or a supra-angelic being such as Metatron: 2a 1 The goings and comings of the souls of people 2 is held in his hand and he completes the work of the great princes 3 who are appointed over the entrances of the watches of God. 4 And he lifts [or, 'takes'] them by his hand, the same souls, and 5 the same completed book and they go and give them 6 to the guardians [or, 'angels'] and the holy ones greater than them.

In §47, this book is asso-ciated with a prooftext from Daniel 7: I 0, \"The judgement was set and the books were opened.\" Either the plural ma'ase of Schafer §47 or the plural sijrin of Daniel 7:10, may have influenced the plural modifier which follows in our text, i.e. \"are opened\" rather than the grammatically correct \"is open.\" 58 The text gives a plural form although the subject is singular, seen. 167, above. 59 In §72 (=3 Enoch 48c) Metatron is called God's 'ayd or \"witness.\" See Schafer, Genizah, p. 134, n. 2b/17f, where he writes, \"Die Funktion des 'ayd ki:innte auf Metatron verweisen\". 60 A close parallel to the phrase, \"And all the thoughts of the heart are revealed to him\" is found in § 14 (= 3 Enoch II), where the phrase, \"and all the thoughts of the hearts of living beings ..... are revealed to me as they are revealed before the Creator (Yotser Bereshit).\" Concerning this parallel, Schafer writes, \"Vgl. §14 (3.

As the souls ascend, they are passed along to different sets of holy beings, until they arrive at the \"great house\" where they are judged by the \"one who judges the world\". The final line (18) describes how the entire world hangs on his (the judge of the world's) arm. This image forms a segue into the next section, 2b, which begins with an account of how the souls are actually judged. Much of the imagery and terminology in section 2b appears in other Hekhalot passages where the subject is clearly God. In this passage, however, these images and terms appear with other motifs generally associated with Metatron, making it extremely difficult to determine whether God or His angelic vice regent is the subject of the description. Line 4 introduces the first ambiguity, for a \"prince\" who is described as \"moving the sea\" perceives the deeds of the souls \"in a single glance and examines and determines their judgements and establishes them on the truth.\" If the subject were God, it seems extremely unlikely that the term \"prince\" or sar would be employed. Nevertheless, the epithet \"who moves the sea\" is applied to God in another Hekhalot passage. The description of how this prince is able to instantly apprehend human deeds, appropriately characterizes either God, or Metatron, who in 3 Enoch 11, is granted the omni-scient knowledge of human deeds described here. Lines 7-15 depict an enthroned figure of judgement, with the hypostatic attributes of justice/righteousness at his right, mercy at his left, and truth before him. Although these attributes are generally associated with God, BT Berakhot 7 a and Synapse § 151, apply them to \"Akatriel Yah Lord of Hosts,\" who may be an angelic vice regent figure in these passages. It is also significant that Elohim and Adonai are equated with the hypostatic figures of justice and mercy respec-tively, since these are names of God. The confusion over the subject of the description is heightened by three features which appear in lines 15-18. First, in line 15, we find the image of the scales, which is associated in 3 Enoch with the angelic being Shoqed Hozii (who is identified with Metatron, in other passages). Second, in line 1 7, the enthroned figure is called a \"witness\" ('ayd) an epithet associated with Metatron in 3 Enoch 48c.

The situation becomes even more cloudy when we turn to the question of God's anthropomorphic form and its relationship to the chief angel. The possibility that the Angel of the Lord actually embodies God is already present in the Bible and, as several schol-ars have shown, emerges in apocalyptic writings as well. 62 The nature of God's hypostatic form or Shiur Q,omah in Merkabah sources has been widely debated. In an earlier work, I discussed this debate, focusing in particular on the complex position of Gershom Scholem.63 I concluded my discussion by affirming Gedaliahu Stroumsa's suggestion that an ancient, perhaps even the original, version of the Shiur Qgmah tradition understood the subject of the descriptions to be a Name bearing angel, most likely Metatron.64 In addition to the link between Metatron and the Shiur Qgmah, it also appears that some sources understood Metatron to be the hypostat-ic embodiment of a particular part of the divine form, most notably the face of God. As I have argued elsewhere, it is likely that this tra-dition underlies the tide sar ha-panim, which is associated with Metatron. Rather than \"prince of the face [of God]\", this title is bet-ter understood as \"prince who is the face [of God]\". 65 Indeed, at least one Merkabah passage explicidy identifies Metatron as the hypostatic face of God: Moses said to the Lord of all the worlds: \"'If your face does not go [with us], do not bring me up from here.'\" [Ex. 33:15] The Lord of all the worlds warned Moses that he should beware of that face of his. So it is written, \"Beware of his face\". [Ex. 23:21 J This is he who is written with the one letter by which heaven and earth were cre-ated, and was sealed with the seal of \"I am that I am\" [Ex. 3: 14] .... This is the prince who is called Y ofiel Yah-dariel... .. he is called Metatron.

This phrase echoes a series of descriptions in 3 Enoch which imply that Metatron may have been understood as a demiurgic figure by some Merkabah mystics. In 3 Enoch 11, Metatron declares that \"all mysteries of Torah and all secrets of wisdom, and all depths of purity, and all thoughts of the hearts of living creatures, and all secrets of the world, and all the secrets of Creation are revealed before me as they are revealed before the Creator [yoser bereshit].\" In chapter 12, God clothes Metatron in a garment of glory, crowns him, and calls him \"the Lesser YHWH\" or Yahweh Ha-Qgtan. In chapter 13, Metatron states that out of the \"great love and mercy with which the Holy One, blessed be He, loved and adored me more than all the children of heavens, He wrote with his finger, with a flaming style, upon the crown on my head the letters by which the heavens and earth were created.\" Despite the link between Metatron and the \"secrets of creation,\" 3 Enoch still maintains a distinction between Metatron and the Yoser Bereshit or Creator. The question of whether Jewish sources identifY a figure other than God as the creator of the world has long been a thorny one, since the existence of a demiurge is one of the defining features of Gnosticism and is traditionally viewed as one of the chief ways in which Gnostic movements diverged from late antique Judaism and Christianity. A number of scholars have suggested that the portrayal of Metatron in 3 Enoch, while not demiurgic, per se, reveals \"the matrix of ideas out of which the Gnostic concept of the demiurge has risen.\"67 Other scholars have gone one step further by attempting to reconstruct a no longer extant Jewish tradition which attributed demiurgic function to an angelic figure such as Metatron.68 Thus, in Stroumsa's view: \"It was Jewish speculation about the cos-67 Fossum, 'The Name of God and the Angel of the Lord, p. 301.

R. Levi quoted R. Hama b. 'Uqba, quoting R. Johanan: The prince dwells only in Zebul, and it is he who consti-tutes the fullness of Zebul. Thousands of thousands and myriads of myriads are in his presence, serving him. Daniel says of them: \"While I was watching, thrones, and so forth..... A river of fire flowed ..... \" [Daniel 7:9-10] What is his name? Qtmos is his name. R. Isaac says: Me'attah is his name. R. 'Anayni b. Sasson says: Bizebul is his name. R. Tanhum the elder says: 'ttyh is his name. Eleazar of Nadwad says: Metatron, like the name of the Power. Those who make use of the name say: slns is his name, qs bs bs qbs is his name, similar to the name of the creator of the world.71 The identification of Metatron with the Ancient of Days is provoca-tive for two reasons. First, in Daniel 7:9-10, the Ancient of Days 69 Stroumsa, \"Form(s) of God,\" pp. 287-288. Joseph Dan, \"Anafiel, Metatron, and the Creator,\" Tarbiz 52, 1983 (Hebrew), p. 457 has argued that a demiurgic role was ascribed to tbe angelic figure Anafiel and that Metatron and Anafiel may have originally been \"a single entity, which was differentiated only at tbe moment when the aggadah of the apotheosis/ ascension of Enoch was joined to the image of Metatron,\" since this link precluded his identification with a pre-existent demiurge. It is significant that Anafiel, like Metatron, is described as \"a servant who is named after his master,\" (Synapse §§242, 244) and is stationed at the \"gate of the seventh hekhal\" (§245), where he guides the mystic to tbe vision of the \"King in His beau-ty\" (§250). Metatron is explicitly depicted as the demiurge in the medieval writings of Abraham Ibn Izra and Abraham ben David of Posquieres (RABaD). See Elliot Wolfson, \"God, tbe Demiurge, and the Intellect: On tbe Usage of the the Word Kol in Abraham ibn Ezra,\" Revue des etudesjuives 149, 1990, esp. pp. 93-lOl. 70 It should be noted that in at least one of the Shiur Qgm,ah passages, God, rather than Metatron, is explicitly referred to as the Ancient of Days (atiq yomin), cf. Martin Cohen, The Shi'ur Qgmah: Texts and Recensions, Tubingen, 1985, p. 116, line 392. In 3 Enoch 28, God (i.e. the \"Holy One\") is described as sitting in judgement and \"the hair of his head is as pure wool,\" a clear allusion to the Ancient of Days in Daniel 7; while inch. 35, Daniel 7:10 is cited in reference to the Holy One blessed be He. 71 The Vtsions qfEzekiel, ed.

Second, in addition to the Ancient of Days, Metatron bears a resemblance to the Son of Man of Daniel 7:13-14.72 Ancient evidence for the con-flation of the two figures in Daniel 7 comes from LXX Daniel 7: 13, where instead of reading the Son of Man \"came unto [heos] the Ancient of Days,\" the text reads \"came as [hos] the Ancient of Days\".73 Commenting on this passage, Rowland writes: \"This vari-ant suggests that the Son of Man is in fact the embodiment of the person of the Ancient of Days. In other words the original scene in Daniel 7, where two figures exist alongside each other in heaven, is changed so that the vice-regent, the Son of Man, takes upon him-self the form and character of God himself.\"74 The conflation of the Ancient of Days and the Son of Man into a single figure recalls the widespread rabbinic tradition that God appears as both an old man and a youth. 75 In BT Hag. 14a, R. Samuel ben N ahman depicts God as both the Ancient of Days in Daniel 7:9 and the youth in Song of Songs 5:11. Other rabbinic pas-sages portray God as an old man full of mercy at Sinai (zaqen male' rahamim), and a young warrior at the Sea of Reeds.76 Gedaliahu Stroumsa has shown that Metatron embodies a similar \"two-fold polymo:rphy.\"77 The most striking evidence for this parallel between God and Metatron appears in BT Y ebamoth 16b, where in anoth-er tradition attributed to R. Samuel ben N ahman, the Sar Ha-'Olam or \"Prince of the World\" (another title for Metatron) declares: \"I have been young, but now I am old.\" (Ps. 37:25Y\" 72 Frank Cross, Canaanite Mjth and Hebrew Epic, Cambridge/London, 1973, pp. 16-17, argues that the Son of Man is \"evidently young Ba'l reinterpreted and democ-ratized by the apocalyptiCJst as the jeWlsh nation,\" whereas the Ancient of Days echoes the figure of El. 73 Cf.

Rather than affirming an unbreachable gulf in these texts, the angelic vice regent functions as an embodied limin, whose janus like character symbolizes the ability to move from one state of existence to another. As David Halperin has written concerning the connection of Metatron and Moses: \"As Metatron is a 'lesser' Yahweh, so he is a 'greater' Moses.\"79 comes from Abraham Abulafia's Hayyei Ha-'Olam Ha-Ba and from parallels with Jesus, cf. below. 79 David Halperin, Faces qf the Chariot, p. 426."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR THE FALL OF METATRON This chapter will focus on the evidence for an internal polemic with-in rabbinic and Hekhalot texts against the angelic vice regent. The polemic focuses on the figure of Metatron although one of the texts I will examine mentions the figure Akatriel rather than Metatron and is exceptional in other ways as well. These texts reflect an uneasiness with the ascent and angelification of human beings, on the one hand, and the depiction of the angelic vice regent as a sec-ond -albeit lesser -deity, on the other. They polemicize against these related traditions by creating a worst case scenario: a mystic ascends to heaven, where instead of seeing God and undergoing a process of angelification, he mistakenly sees the chief angel as a sec-ond deity and is transformed into an arch-heretic. In other Merkabah texts, vision is intimately linked to the mystic's angelifica-tion (as Elliot Wolfson has shown). In these passages, vision is the source of heresy. Thus, along with the angelification of the mystic and the God-like appearance of the angelic vice regent, these texts also problematize the visionary focus of much of Merkabah mysti-cism. In the passages I have discussed thus far, Metatron serves as the chief symbol for the continuum between human beings, angels, and God. The following passages employ Metatron for a contrary pur-pose: to highlight the hierarchical relationship between different cat-egories of being(s). The transformation of Elisha ben Abuya into Aher, a name which means \"alien\" or \"other,\" may be read as an opposite process to the angelification or deification of successful Merkabah mystics in other texts. His failure results in a complete separation or alienation from God, as the heavenly voice calls out, \"Return backsliding children -except for Aher!\" The reification of boundaries, therefore, rather than their crossing, is the goal of these passages. Having said this, it is important to note that not all of these pas-sages are equally critical regarding the angelic vice regent or the Merkabah mystic. Indeed, at least one of the texts I will examine actually defends both the mystic and the angelic vice regent, in this case Akatriel, although in other ways the text seems to belong to what I will call the Aher /Metatron tradition. At the other end of"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"THE FALL OF METATRON 49 the spectrum stands the Babylonian Talmud's version of Aher's encounter with Metatron which in my opinion contains the strongest polemic. Determining the relationship between what appear to be different (sometimes very different) versions of the same textual tra-dition is one of my goals. In doing so, I hope to show that the line between rabbinic and Hekhalot literature is sometimes difficult to discern. Finally, I seek to understand the relationship between this polemical tradition and the more positive depictions of the angelic vice regent. Did the former function as a kind of warning label attached to Merkabah traditions in order to make sure that the line between God and his creatures was not completely erased? Did it represent another school within the mystical tradition or even the voice of certain opponents of Merkabah mysticism which were nev-ertheless preserved by the editors of the mystical texts, themselves? The danger that some devotees might actually worship Metatron in place of God is clear from a beraita in BT Sanh. 38b: Once a min said to R. Idith, It is written: \"And unto Moses He said, come up to YHWH\" (Exodus 24:1). Surely it should have said: Come up to Me! This was Metatron, he replied, whose name is like that of his Master, for it is written: \"For My Name is in him\" (Exodus 23:21). But, if so, we should worship him! R. Idith replied, The same verse, however, says: \"Do not rebel against him.\" (This means:) Do not exchange him for Me [reading al temor (do not exchange) for al tammer (do not rebel)]. But, if so, why is it stated: \"He will not pardon your transgressions\" (loc. cit., above)? He answered, Indeed, we would not accept him even as a messen-ger, for it is written: \"If Your Presence go not with us\" (Exodus 23: 15).1 A similar danger underlies a more famous rabbinic episode: Aher's heavenly encounter with Metatron. The talmudic context of this tra-dition is the story of the four rabbis who entered Pardes.2 Although the episode occurs in only one talmudic passage~ BTHagigah 15a 1 For a detailed discussion of this passage, cf. Alan Segal, Two Powers in Heaven, pp. 68-69. 2 Studies on the Pardes account have included (although this is by no means an exhaustive list) those of Heinrich Graetz, Gnosticismus und Judenthum, Krotoschin, 1846, who read the Pardes account as a rabbinic expression of the Gnostic contro-versy; Gershom Scholem, Major Trends in Jewish Mystic!STll, pp. 52-53, and Jewish Gnosticism, pp. 14-19, who viewed rabbinic and Hekhalot Pardes accounts as relat-ed descriptions of heavenly ascent; Ephraim Urbach, \"Ha-Mesorot 'al Torat ha-Sod be-Tequfat ha-Tannaim,\" in Eprhaim E.

He notes that Munich 95 gives no indication that Metatron's sin was specifically sitting in the presence of Aher. Indeed, section E declares that \"It was taught that on high there is no standing and no sitting,\" in other words, sit-ting is not identified as being more problematic than standing. Like Munich 95, Vaticanus 134, section E prohibits both sitting and standing in heaven. However, Vaticanus 134, section D adds that Aher saw that Metatron was given permission to \"sit for one hour in the day,\" thereby implying that Metatron's sitting inspired Aher's heresy. 5 While Vatican us 134 restricts Metatron's sitting to one hour a day, Bomberg, section D simply states that Metatron was given permission to sit. Furthermore, Bomberg adds a section absent from the other manuscripts, in which Metatron is condemned for not standing up when he saw Aher (section H). Finally, Bomberg, sec-tion E lacks the reference to standing which is present in the other manuscripts, and reads \"It is taught that on high there is no sitting, . lry \" no nva ..... Alexander accounts for the differences between the manuscripts by arguing that Munich 95 represents the earliest recension of the account, while Vaticanus 134 represents a later recension, and Bomberg the latest. This reconstruction is largely based on Alexander's evaluation of section E of the manuscripts. As men-tioned above, Munich 95 and Vaticanus 134 both declare that there is no sitting and standing on high, while Bomberg lacks the refer-ence to standing. According to Alexander, not only does the pres-ence of the word standing create \"a more balanced, rhythmic form\" in the Hebrew original, but it indicates the lectio difficilior, since it creates a contradiction in Vaticanus 134, namely, if there is \"no standing and no sitting\" in heaven, how come Metatron is given per-mission to sit for one hour a day?6 It seems unlikely that Vaticanus 134 would have introduced such a complication to the formulation preserved in Bomberg (i.e. without the reference to standing). Therefore, the original version of the quotation must have included both standing and sitting. Thus, the emphasis on sitting in Vaticanus 134, and to a much greater degree in Bomberg, reflects an attempt to clarify the cause 5 The emphasis on sitting may have been inspired by the tradition that angels do not have joints, c£ Ezekiel 1:7, \"their legs were straight legs\"; Genesis Rabbah 65:21; PT Berakhot 1: 1; Leviticus Rahbah 6:3, etc. 6 \"3 Enoch and the Talmud,\" p. 60."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"THE FALL OF METATRON 53 ofMetatron's undoing, something which is unclear from Munich 95. Probably aware of the tradition that angels cannot sit because they lack joints, the authors of Vaticanus 134 and Bomberg focused on the motif of sitting in the quotation in section E. Bomberg represents the latest stage of the tradition since it cleans up the quotation in section E, by eliminating the apparent contradiction preserved in Vatican us 134.7 Having reconstructed the sequence of the talmudic recensions, Alexander turns his attention to the relationship between the talmu-dic accounts and the version of Metatron's downfall in 3 Enoch 16: 3 Enoch 16:1-5 (Synopse §20): Rabbi Ishmael said: \"Metatron, the Prince of Countenance, the splendor of the highest heaven, said to me: At first I was sitting on a throne of glory at the entrance to the sev-enth hekhal and I judged all the denizens of the heights, the famil-ia of God, on the authority of the Holy One blessed be he. I dis-tributed greatness, royalty, rank, rule, splendor, praise, diadem, crown, and glory to all the Princes of Kingdoms, when I sat in the heavenly court. And the Princes of Kingdoms stood beside me, to my right and to my left, by authority of the Holy One blessed be he. But when Aher came to gaze on the vision of the Merkabah and set his eyes on me, he became frightened and trembled before me. And his soul was alarmed [to the point] of leaving him because of fear, dread and terror of me, when he saw me when I was sitting on a throne like a king, and ministering angels were standing beside me like servants and all the Princes of Kingdoms crowned with crowns surrounded me. And in the same moment, he opened his mouth and said: \"Surely there are two powers in heaven.\" Immediately a heav-enly voice went out from before the Shekinah saying: \"Return, back-sliding children, except Aher.\" In the same moment, 'Anafiel YHWH, the glorified, splendid, endeared, wonderful, terrible, and dreadful Prince came at the dispatch of the Holy One blessed be he and struck me sixty lashes of light and stood me on my feet.\" Although there are considerable differences between 3 Enoch 16 and the talmudic manuscripts, Alexander argues that \"It is the central role of 'sitting' that allies 3 Enoch's version of the story with that of Bomberg, and sets it apart from Munich 95. Of course once again the option is, in principle, open that both 3 Enoch and Bomberg drew on a common, lost source, but there is no advantage in taking this line. It is much simpler to suppose that the author of 3 Enoch 'Ibid., p. 62."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"54 CHAPTER FOUR 16:1-5 knew and used the Bomberg version of the story.\"8 Therefore, Alexander concludes that \"3 Enoch is based on the Bomberg ver-sion of the humbling of Metatron, i.e. it derives from the latest stage in the evolution of the Talmudic tradition.\"' C. R. A Morray-Jones has critically examined Alexander's model. Although Morray-Jones accepts Alexander's reconstruction of the sequence of the talmudic manuscripts (as do I), he disagrees with Alexander's view of the relationship between the talmudic tradition and 3 Enoch 16. In Morray-Jones' view, it seems likely that the tal-mudic accounts represent a \"softening\" of an earlier, more radical tradition which is preserved in 3 Enoch. According to Morray:J ones, the cause of Aher's error in 3 Enoch is not simply that Metatron was seated, as Alexander implies, but Metatron's \"god-like and glorious appearance as the enthroned 'Grand Vizier' of Heaven.\"10 Since the talmudic redactors were interested in discouraging the most extreme forms of Metatron speculation, they eliminated all references to Metatron's glorious and god-like appearance and, instead, charac-terized him as a less threatening celestial scribe. Morray-Jones con-cludes that \"the talmudic story in its earliest recension [i.e. Munich 95], represents an abbreviated and heavily edited version of the orig-inal, which is more fully preserved at 3 Enoch 16.\"11 In order to shed further light on the tradition of Metatron's down-fall, I would like to examine two additional sources. The first pas-sage is Synapse §672, which explains the apostasy of Elisha ben Abuya in the following way: Synapse §672 And these are the men who entered the Pardes ..... \"Elisha ben Abuya cut the shoots.\" Concerning him Scripture says: \"Do not allow your mouth, and so forth. They said when Elisha ben Abuya descended to the Merkabah he saw Metatron to whom per-mission was given to sit and write down the merits qf Israel fir an hour a day. 8 Ibid., p. 64. 'Ibid. 10Morray:Jones, \"Hekhalot Literature and Talmudic Tradition,\" p. 30. 11 Ibid., p. 31, as Morray:Jones explains, \"In the talmudic versions then, the story of Aher's disastrous encounter with Metatron is re-told in such a way as to mini-mize and guard against precisely the kind of extravagent speculation concerning the glorious and God-hke appearance of the Lesser Lord; that is preserved in Sefer Hekhalot [i. e. 3 Enoch]\". Indeed, Alexander, himself, speculates that the original motivation behind the talmudic tradition \"may not have been what Metatron was doing, but rather his glorious appearance\" See \"3 Enoch and the Talmud,\" p. 62."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"THE FAll OF METATRON 55 He said: \"The sages have taught that on high there is no standmg and no sitting, no jealousy and no rivalry, and no neck and no affliction.\" He contemplated [hirher] that perhaps there are two powers in heav-en. Immediately they brought out Metatron to outside the Curtain (Pargod) and struck him with sixty fiery lashes. And they gave Metatron permission to burn Elisha's merits. A heavenly voice went out and said: \"Return, backsliding children, except for Aher.\" [emphasis added] There are important similarities and differences between this passage and the other versions of Metatron's humbling. Unlike all the tal-mudic manuscripts, Synapse §672 does not open its description with the line \"Aher cut the shoots,\" but, instead reads \"Elisha ben Abuyah cut the shoots\". This reading jibes more closely with the ver-sion of the Pardes account in Tosefta Hag. 2:4: \"Elisha looked and cut the shoots\" and is identical with the version in Song of Songs Rabbah to 1:4.12 Synapse §672 states that Elisha \"contemplated\" (hirher) that perhaps there are two powers in heaven\". By contrast 3 Enoch 16 describes Aher as sqying that \"There are indeed two powers in heaven,\" while all of the talmudic recensions have Aher declare \"Perhaps -God forbid! -there are two powers.\" 3 Enoch 16 and §672, therefore, share the specific reference to the two powers in heaven, while the talmudic recensions and §672 temper the declaration of Aher/Elisha by adding the word \"perhaps\" (and in the case of the Talmud, \"God forbid\"). Unlike either the talmudic manuscripts or 3 Enoch 16, §672 describes Aher /Elisha as only contemplating rather than declaring his heretical idea. This feature may have been included to ameliorate the severity of Elisha's sin or it may reflect the reluctance of the authors to even record such a heretical declaration. In any case, the implication of §672 is that even contemplating the existence of two powers in heaven is a sin, let alone actually declaring their existence. Although the talmudic accounts do not explicitly declare where Metatron is located, the implication is that he is within the Pardes, since the opening line declares that \"Four entered the Pardes ..... \" By contrast, 3 Enoch 16 describes Metatron as sitting at the entrance of the seventh hekhal (\"palace\"), the exact location where he is enthroned by God in 3 Enoch 10. By contrast, §672 reinforces the idea that Metatron was in the Pardes when confronted by 12 The Palestinian Talmud Hag. 2:1 77b has \"Aher looked and cut the shoots \""},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"56 CHAPTER FOUR Elisha/ Aher, for it states that \"they brought Metatron to outside the Curtain,\" in order to whip him, a detail absent from the other ver-sions. By introducing its account with the talmudic line, \"Four who entered the Pardes,\" §672 clearly indicates that the Pardes was the site of the episode (in contrast to 3 Enoch 16). Nevertheless, §672 essentially glosses the talmudic tradition by adding that \"Elisha ben Abuya descended to the Merkabah\". In doing so, §672 incorporates the Pardes account into the Merkabah tradition and preserves a par-allel with 3 Enoch 16, which states that \"Aher came to gaze on the vision of the Merkabah.\" Besides this reference to Elisha's descent to the Merkabah, however, §672 lacks any obvious indications that it belongs to the Hekhalot genre, whereas 3 Enoch 16 clearly indicates its Hekhalot provenance in a number of ways. 13 Significantly, §672 reads like a Hebrew parallel to the Aramaic version in Vaticanus 134.14 Both passages include the reference to \"no standing and no sitting\" and most strikingly, both declare that Metatron was given permission to \"sit and write down the merits of Israel for one hour a day,\" a detail which is absent from all other versions.15 If we regard the reference to Elisha's descent to the Merkabah as a gloss, whose function was to incorporate the passage into the Hekhalot genre, then we are faced with the conclusion that either §672 drew on Vaticanus 134 for its primary inspiration, that Vaticanus 134 drew on §672, or that both passages drew on a com-mon source. It also seems likely that the version of the story pre-served in Bomberg was either unknown to the author of §672 or had not yet been formulated. As for the relationship between §672 and 3 Enoch 16, it appears that besides their common references to the Merkabah, and the \"two powers in heaven,\" there are no other lexical links between the two passages. There is, however, the intriguing reference in §672 to Metatron being cast \"outside the Curtain\" following Elisha's aposta-sy, while in 3 Enoch 16, Metatron is portrayed as being enthtroned outside of the Curtain, at the entrance of the seventh hekhal, bifbre \" With references to the seventh hekhal, the Merkabah, Anafiel, etc. 14 Despite the differences between them. In addition to the ones I have already mentioned, it should be noted that §672 declares that \"they gave Metatron per-mission to bum Elisha's merits.\" a line wh1ch is absent from all the other versions, and which sets up a parallel between the whipping of Metatron With fiery lashes and the burning of Elisha's merits. 15 Although the quotations in their entirety have minor chfferences."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"THE FALL OF METATRON 57 Aher encounters him. It is possible that each passage preserves a competing tradition (one negative; one positive) explaining how Metatron ended up at the entrance of God's abode, rather than inside it. Do my observations concerning §672 shed light on the relationship between 3 Enoch 16 and the talmudic recensions? At the very least, they indicate that §672 was probably not influenced by the final recension in MS Bamberg, which Alexander has argued underlies the version in 3 Enoch. On the other other hand, §672 also preserves a Hekhalot tradition which is either unaware of, or has chosen to suppress the glorious appearance of Metatron emphasized by 3 Enoch 16. Our ability to reconstruct the relationship of the different versions is further complicated by the final Hekhalot witness to the tradition, Synapse §597: Synapse §597 Elisha ben Abuya said: When I ascended to the Pardes, I saw Akatriel Yah, God of Israel, Lord of hosts, sitting at the entrance of Pardes and one hundred and twenty myriads of minstering angels were surrounding him. As it is written: \"Thousands upon thousands served him and myriads upon myriads stood before him,\" [Daniel 7: 10]. When I saw them I was alarmed, I trembled, and I pushed myself and entered before the Holy One blessed be he. I said to him: \"Master of the world, as you wrote in your Torah: \"The heavens and the heavens of heavens belong to the Lord your God,\" [Deut. 10:14]. And it is written: \"The firmament declares your handiwork,\" [Psalm 19:2]. [This implies] only one [God]. He said to me: \"Elisha my son, did you come here only to find fault with my attributes [le-harher 'al midotaz]? Haven't you heard the proverb which goes ..... \" In §597, instead of encountering Metatron, as he does in the other passages I have examined, Elisha ben Abuya sees Akatriel Yah, God of Israel, Lord of Hosts, sitting at the entrance of Pardes. Although it may therefore be argued that §597 does not belong to the tradi-tions concerning Metatron's downfall, it is clear that this passage is related to the other accounts. Like Metatron, Akatriel is a highly ambivalent figure. §597 calls Akatriel \"God of Israel, Lord of Hosts,\" which seems to imply that Akatriel is God, except that later in the passage, Elisha actually enters Pardes and encounters the Holy One blessed be he, the most common rabbinic title for God.16 A figure named Akatriel appears in 16 In fact, Hekhalot sources often refer to exalted angels such as Akatriel and"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"58 CHAPTER FOUR a number of rabbinic and Hekhalot sources. In BT Berakhot 7a (C£ parallel in Synapse § 151 ), Akatriel is described as follows: R. Ishmael ben Elisha says: I once entered the innermost part [of the Sanctuary] to burn incense and saw Akatriel Yah, the Lord of Hosts, seat-ed upon a high and exalted throne. He said to me: \"Ishmael, my son, bless me.\" I replied: \"May it be your will that your mercy will suppress your anger and your mercy will prevail over your other attributes [muidotekha]. And that you will act with your children according to the measure of mercy and on their behalf, stop short of the limit of strict justice.\" And he nod-ded to me with his head.\" As Scholem noted, it cannot be determined from this passage whether \"Akatriel, represents the name of an angel or the name of God Himself in one of the aspects of His glory as it is revealed upon the throne\". 18 In 3 Enoch 15B, Akatriel YHWH of Hosts functions as a manifestation of God and is described as ordering Metatron to ful-fill the requests of Moses. 19 Akatriel appears in other Hekhalot pas-sages, as well, where he is characterized as God, an angel, or the secret name engraved on the divine throne or crown.20 In order to fully appreciate the similarities and differences between §597 and the other accounts, I will analyze §597 in detail. Unlike §672 and the talmudic recensions, §597 does not begin with the line \"Aher/Elisha ben Abuya cut the shoots.\" Instead it opens with the line \"Elisha ben Abuya said,\" and portrays the episode as the first-person testimony of Elisha ben Abuya, just as 3 Enoch 16 treats the episode as the first person testimony of Metatron (the other accounts are in the third person). These differences in narrative voice are important because they suggest a difference in perspective. By por-traying him as a heavenly scribe rather than a glorious vice regent, the Talmud depicts Metatron as a more lowly figure than 3 Enoch. The latter text's more sympathetic image of Metatron is rein-forced by his first person account of his heavenly meeting with Aher. Metatron with names reserved for God in more exoteric Jewish literature. C£ Wolfgang Fauth, \"Tatrosjah-Totrosjah und Metatron in der jtidischen Merkabah-Mystik,\" Journal for the Stucfy f!!Judazsm 22, 1991. 17 In Synapse §!51 the same episode is described, except instead of burning incense, R. Ishmael is \"offering a sacrifice on the altar\" when he sees Akatriel. \"JeWish Gnostzczsm, p. 51. For a discussion of the mythical significance of this pas-sage see, Yehuda Liebes, \"Dei Natura Dei: On the Development of the Jewish Myth,\" m Studzes in Jewish Myth and Jewish Messzamsm, Albany, 1993, pp. !Off. 19 The identification of Akatriel with God and not an angel in this passage is sup-ported by Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism, p. 52, Odeberg, 3 Enoch, ch. 15B, p. 42,n. 4, and Alexander, \"3 (Hebrew Apocalypse o~ Enoch,\" p. 304. 20 The name Akatriel appears in a number of Hekhalot passages, including § 130, where it is probably a name for God; §138, where Akatriel is either God or an angel"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"THE FALL OF METATRON 59 In 3 Enoch, we hear Metatron's side of the story, as it were. Likewise, §597 provides us with Elisha ben Abuya's perspective on what hap-pened when he ascended to Pardes and not coincidently, I would argue, §597 presents a much more sympathetic portrayal of Elisha ben Abuya. One way of explaining these differences is that both 3 Enoch and §597 represent voices from within Merkabah circles, whereas the Talmud may reflect a dissenting view from without the mystical tra-dition or a more conservative voice from within the Merkabah movement.21 The use of first person voices establishes an empathet-ic link between the reader (presumably a mystic, himself) and the fig-ures of Metatron and Elisha ben Abuya, respectively. This is signif-icant given the broader phenomenon of identification within Merkabah mysticism. Thus, Metatron was once Enoch, who serves as a model for Rabbi Ishmael, who in turn serves as a model for the readers of the Merkabah texts. It is also important to note the dif-ferent contexts of the accounts. The talmudic account was intended for a general audience, whereas the Hekhalot passages were written for a limited audience of mystical adepts. The Talmud's version may therefore function as a warning to the general public against the pos-sible dangers of Merkabah mysticism. §597 continues with Elisha's declaration \"When I ascended to the Pardes\". The explicit reference to ascension contrasts §597 with the talmudic accounts, which open with the line \"Four entered (nekhne-su) the Pardes\" and with 3 Enoch, which states that \"Aher came to gaze on the Merkabah.\" Furthermore, the use of the term \"ascend-ed\" differentiates §597 from §672 which states that Elisha ben Abuya \"descended to the Merkabah.\" Like §672 and the talmudic versions, and unlike 3 Enoch 16, which refers to the hekhalot, §597 depicts the Pardes as the location of the episode. Yet, in striking contrast to who receives prayers; §310 where Metatron is called Akatriel's \"servant\" and Akatriel is implicity Identified with God; Geniza fragment 19, which parallels §310; §501, where the name Akatriel is engraved on God's crown and throne; §667, where Akatnel IS an angel in the fourth heaven, and §310 = §678, where Akatriel is the name of an angel. Scholem has argued, Jewish Gnostutsm, p. 54, that \"to define Akatnel in this way, as a secret name of the crown, seems to be both a plausible and a rational explanation of its etymology.\" William Roseanau, \"Some Notes on Akatriel,\" Onental Studus Dedtcated to Paul Haupt, Baltimore, 1926, pp. 103-105, arrives at the same conclusion. Scholem, ibid., n. 35, writes that Rosenau \"has 'guessed' the correct explanation without being aware of existence of the various passages in the Merkabah literature and without mentioning Rashi, from whose commentary he took it.\" 21 As I have suggested above, §672 appears to belong to the same branch of the tradition as MS Vaticanus."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"60 CHAPTER FOUR §672, §597 does not add a gloss to integrate its account into the Hekhalot genre. Indeed, there is no mention of the Merkabah in §597, unlike in both §672 and 3 Enoch. Strikingly, Elisha's vision of Akatriel does not occur within the Pardes, as implied in the talmudic versions and §672, but at its entrance, a detail which jibes structurally with the location of Metatron at the entrance of the seventh hekhal in 3 Enoch. At this point, we might ask whether §597 has merely transformed the motif in 3 Enoch 16, transferring the locus of the encounter from the entrance of the seventh hekhal to the entrance of Pardes or whether there is another source which may have influenced its formulation. In fact, there is a pre-talmudic tradition which parallels the location in §597.22 In the Testament qf Abraham, Recension A, (c. 100 CE), Abraham ascends to heaven and encounters the proto-plast Adam (Gk. ho pro-toplastos) seated on a throne at the entrance of Paradise. Because of its many thematic connections to the Aher /Metatron tradition, I will cite chapter 11 at length and will italicize those phrases which are most significant for my comparison: Michael turned the chariot and brought Abraham toward the east, to the first gate of heaven. And Abraham saw ..... a man seated an a golden throne. And the appearance qf that man was temjjnng, like the Master's . ..... And when the wondrous one who was seated on the throne of gold saw few entering through the strait gate, but many entering the broad gate, immediately that wondrous man tore the hair of his head and the beard of his cheeks, and he threw hzmselj on the ground .from hzs throne crying and wailing. And when he saw many souls entering through the strait gate, then he arose .from the earth and sat on his throne, very cheerfully rejoicing and exulting. Then Abraham asked the Commander-in-chief, \"My lord Commander-in-chief, who zs thzs most wondrous man, who zs adorned zn such glory ..... \"This is the first-formed Adam who is in such glory, and he looks at the world, since every-one has come from him. And when he sees many souls entering through the strait gate, the he arises and sits on his throne rejoicing and exulting cheerfully, because this strait gate is (the gate) of the righteous, which leads to life, and those who enter through zt come mto Paradzse ..... And when he sees many souls entering the broad gate, then he pulls the hair of his head and casts himself on the ground crying and wailing bitterly; for the broad gate is (the gate) of the sinners, which leads to destruction and eternal punishment. 23 22 As Morray-Jones has noted: \"This Is analogous to the position of Metatron in 3 Enoch, a precise parallel is found in a survivmg fragment of a lost Hekhalot work [i e §597].\" Transformational Mysticism,\" p. 17. \"E.P.

The appearance of this enthroned being is \"terri-fying, like the Master's.\" The terrifying character of the being in the Testament qf Abraham parallels the depictions of Metatron and Akatriel in 3 Enoch and §597, respectively. Even more significantly, this being is described as resembling the \"Master\" -that is, God -precise-ly the source for the confusion in all of the versions of the Aher /Metatron tradition. 24 Unlike Aher, Abraham possesses a heavenly guide in the form of Michael. This detail also differentiates Aher from R. Ishmael who is led through heaven by Metatron in 3 Enoch. Indeed, part of the polemical focus of the Aher /Metatron tradition may be directed against the practice of heavenly ascents without an angelic guide, perhaps indicating a desire to preserve an earlier, apocalyptic model for ascents. Certainly, the presence of an angelic guide in the Testament qf Abraham leads to a very different result. Rather than spec-ulating that the enthroned being is a second God as in the Aher/Metatron tradition, Abraham wisely asks Michael to identify the mysterious figure: \"Then Abraham asked..... who is this most wondrous man, who is adorned in such glory?\" The text links the enthroned figure to the separation of human beings into righteous and unrighteous camps, a detail which recalls the role of Metatron in the Talmud and §672 as a heavenly scribe who records the merits of Israel. The Testament qf Abraham also con-tains the elements of standing and sitting which feature so promi-nently in the Aher/Metatron tradition. A voluntary dethronement occurs in the Testament qf Abraham when souls enter the broad gate signifying damnation. By contrast, the wondrous figure stands and re-enthrones himself when souls enter the narrow gate of righteous-ness. Although the reasons for enthronement and dethronement are different in the various versions of the Aher/Metatron tradition, the dynamic of standing and sitting is an intriguing parallel. Underlying all the sources is the sense that there are proper and improper times to sit and stand in heaven. Adam dethrones himself as a sign of mourning in the Testament qf Abraham, which employs the same motifs as the Aher/Metatron tradition to produce a different story. 24 That the \"Master\" in chapter 11 of the Testament f!! Abraham should be identi-fied as God is clear from chapter 8."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"62 CHAPTER FOUR Another link between the Testament if Abraham and the Aher I Metatron tradition involves the identification of the \"wondrous\" figure as the proto-plast Adam. Despite the fact that Cosmic Adam traditions originated in Jewish circles, extant Merkabah sources do not possess a Cosmic Adam tradition.25 Nor do they explicitly identify Adam with Metatron, a link which is well documented in kabbalistic sources.26 Nevertheless, several scholars have posited that an early tradition linking the two figures probably existed. According to Odeberg, this tradition was \"obliterated\" as a reaction against Mandaean speculation concerning the Primordial Man, although possible vestiges may still be found in Hekhalot literature. 27 By contrast, Idel prefers to view the suppression of the Cosmic Adam tradition in Hekhalot circles as a product of \"internal tension between different tendencies in early Jewish mysticism,\" rather than as a reaction to Gnostic or Mandaean speculation.28 The existence of a no longer extant tradition linking Metatron and Adam is supported by a number of sources which portray Adam as God's vice regent.29 For example, in 2 Enoch 30:11 God declares concerning Adam: \"And on the earth I assigned him to be a second angel, honored and great and glorious. And I assigned him to be king, to reign on the earth, and to have my wisdom. And there was nothing comparable to him on the earth, even among my creatures that exist.\" Indeed, there exists a rabbinic passage concerning Adam with striking parallels to the Aher /Metatron tradition: 25 Moshe Ide!, \"Enoch is Metatron,\" p. 151. 26 Ibid., pp. 156-157; Ch. Mopsik, I.e Livre hibreu d'Hfnoch ou Livre des palais, pp. 54-55, 210; Odeberg, 3 Enoch, p. 121-123. Moshe Ide! has more recently written on what he calls the myth of Metatron in \"Metatron: Notes on the Development of a Myth in Judaism,\" in Havivah Pedayah, ed., Myth zn Judaism, Jerusalem, 1996 (Hebrew). Unfortunately, !del's essay came to my attention as this book was coming to press and I was unable to include it in my dJscussion. 27 3 Enoch, pp. 77-78 and p. 83: \"Lastly mention must be made of a possible vestige of the conception of Metatron as a primordwl being occuring in ch. 48C: 'I made him (Metatron) strong (or Mighty) in the time of the first Adam'. One might read in this statement an allusion to Metatroil as connected with or being the Primordial man, the ;tldam Q_admon.\" 28 \"Enoch is Metatron,\" p. 152. On the connection between Adam and Enoch, see pp. 155-156. 29 As Jar! Fossum, The Name if God and the Angel if the Lord, p. 271, writes \"That Adam was made God's vice-king over the creation is an old and widespread tradition which is elaborated upon particularly in the so-called Adam literature.\" The Adam literature consists of a group of accounts concerning Adam preserved in Greek, Syriac, Mandaic, Ethwpic, Armenian, and Slavomc, as well as The Apoca!Jpse if Adam from Codex V of the Nag Hammadi Library."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"THE FALL OF METATRON 63 R. Hoshaya said: When the Holy One, blessed be He, created Adam, the ministering angels mistook him for a divine being and wished to utter the Sanctus before him. What does this resemble? A king and a governor who sat in a chariot and his subjects wished to say to the king 'Domine!' but they did not know which one it was. What did the king do? He pushed the governor out of the chariot, so they know who was the king. [Genesis Rahbah 8:9]'0 In this passage, Adam is compared to a governor whose similar appearance to the king confuses the latter's subjects. The parable notes that both king and governor were sitting in a chariot, a parallel to the image of Metatron sitting like God in heaven, particularly since God is said to sit on a throne-chariot (cf. Ezekiel 1). The angels who wish to say the Sanctus before Adam resemble Aher, who wondered whether Metatron was a \"second power\" in heaven. Just as Metatron is dethroned in the Aher /Metatron tradition, so Adam is tossed off the chariot in Genesis Rabbah, making it clear who is and isn't God. In terms of dating, the tradition preserved in Genesis Rabbah may stand somewhere inbetween the other sources. It may have functioned as a polemic against the earlier tradition of the enthroned, glorious Adam whose appearance was \"like the Master's\" and as a bridge between the positive image of the enthroned vice regent figure and the more ambivalent image in the talmudic ver-sion of the Aher /Metatron tradition. Recension B of the Testament qf Abraham preserves a different version of Abraham's heavenly adventure. Instead of getting off his throne as a sign of mourning, in this version Adam cries when he sees a damned soul being led to destruction and laughs when he sees a soul entering the gate of life ( ch. 8). And yet, Recension B preserves other details which may have influenced the development of the Aher/Metatron tradition. In chapter 10, Michael takes Abraham to Paradise. There Abraham sees a judge (whom ch. 11 identifies as Abel) command another figure who \"writes records\" to present himself The description of this figure suggests connections with both Metatron and Akatriel: 3° For discussions of this passage and the Aher/Metatron tradition, see Saul Lieberman, \"Metatron, the Meaning of His Name and His Functions,\" p. 239. On this tradition, see also, Morray-Jones, \"Transformational Mysticism,\" p.17; E. Wolfson, \"Yeridah la-Mekavah,\" pp. 24-25; Ide!, \"Enoch is Metatron,\" p. 153, where he cites a parallel passage from the Alphabet qf Aqiba, and p. 164, n. 18, where he discusses the Geneszs Rabbah passage."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"64 CHAPTER FOUR The judge commanded the one who writes the records to come. And behold, (there came) cherubim bearing two books, and with them was a very enormous man. And he had on his head three crowns, and one crown was higher than the other two crowns. The crowns are called the crowns of witness. And the man had in his hand a golden pen. 31 Like Metatron in the Shiur Qgmah tradition, this figure is described as \"a very enormous man.\" Like Metatron and Akatriel, he is associated with a crown or crowns (indeed the very name Akatriel contains the Hebrew word for crown, keter). These crowns are called the \"crowns of witness,\" a title associated with Metatron (Heb. \"witness\"='19'd). Finally, the figure holds a pen in his hand, which suggests that he is a scribe like Metatron in the Talmudic version of the Aher/Metatron tradition. Chapter 11 makes the connection with Metatron stronger, for it identifies the figure with the pen as Enoch: And the one who produces (the evidence) is the teacher of heaven and earth and the scribe of righteousness, Enoch. For the Lord sent them here in order that they might record the sins and the righteous deeds of each person. And Abraham said, \"And how can Enoch bear the weight of the souls, since he has not seen death? Or how can he give the sentence of all the souls?\" And Michael said, \"If he were to give sentence concerning them, it would not be accepted. But it is not Enoch's business to give sentence; rather, the Lord is the one who gives sentence, and it is this one's (Enoch's) task only to write. For Enoch prayed to the Lord saying, 'Lord, I do not want to give the sentence of the souls, lest I become oppressive to someone.' And the Lord said to Enoch, 'I shall command you to write the sins of a soul that makes atonement, and it will enter into life. And if the soul has not made atonement and repented, you will find its sins (already) written, and it will be cast into punishment.\"'32 This intriguing passage emphasizes that while Enoch has been granted the authority to function as a scribe, he cannot sentence the souls, since this responsibility is reserved for God. Moreover, Enoch is only allowed to record the sins of people who have already atoned and repented and not the sins which are still 'outstanding.' These motifs are remarkably similar to the description of Metatron in the Talmudic version of the Aher /Metatron tradition. In the Talmud, Metatron is described as \"recording the merits of Israel,\" which 31 E.P. Sanders, \"Testament of Abraham,\" Recension B, in James Charlesworth, ed., The Old Testament Pseudepzgrapha, p 900. 32 Ibtd."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"THE FALL OF METATRON 65 jibes with the notion of only recording sins which have already been atoned for. Like the Testament if Abraham, the Talmud does not depict this scribal figure as possessing the authority of a judge. Indeed, the Talmud's attack on Metatron's sitting may be an implicit rejection of this kind of authority. Whereas Metatron makes the mistake of appearing like he possesses the authority of a divine figure rather than a mere scribe, in this passage, Enoch makes it clear that he does \"not want to give sentence.\" Thus, the tales employ similar motifs to different ends. In the Talmud, Metatron appears as a careless figure at best and a hubristic one at worst; in the Testament if Abraham, Enoch explicitly humbles himself and rejects the kind of authority which is the unique possession of God. While it is possible that these thematic parallels are coincidental, the different versions of the Aher /Metatron tradition may also have adopted and transformed elements from both recensions of the Testament if Abraham, a work which probably originated in the first century CE. Returning to §597, we find that Akatriel is described as \"sitting\" and \"one hundred and twenty myriads of ministering angels were surrounding him. As it is written: 'Thousands upon thousands served him and myriads upon myriads stood before him.\"' [Daniel 7:10] In §597, Akatriel is not merely sitting, but is enthroned, just as Metatron is in 3 Enoch 16. Indeed, both passages reflect the image of the divine judge or atiq yomin in Daniel 7:10, although 3 Enoch 16 (\"and ministering angels were standing beside me like servants and all the Princes of Kingdoms crowned with crowns surrounded me\") only implicitly draws on this Vorlage, while §597 explicitly cites the biblical lemma. What does this parallel imply about the relationship of 3 Enoch 16 and §597? Of course, both sources may have independently decided to employ the image of the atiq yomin in Daniel 7: 10 in order to characterize their respective supra-angelic figures. Yet, the other parallels (and we will see more below) between the accounts allude to a closer relationship. Either both passages drew on a common tradition which depicted the subject of Elisha/ Aher's vision as the enthroned vice regent, or one passage was influenced by the other. We have already seen one case in which §597 appears to have preserved an earlier form of a motif shared by 3 Enoch 16, namely the location of the angelic being at the entrance of Pardes or Paradise (as in the Testament if Abraham), rather than at the entrance of the seventh hekhal. Determining which passage preserves the earlier depiction of"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"66 CHAPTER FOUR the enthroned vice regent figure is more difficult. On the one hand, §597 may represent an earlier version because it is more compact and because it explicitly quotes Daniel 7. As the tradition developed it may have expanded to include more details of the angelic vice regent's glorious appearance; and as the formulation became more elaborate, the originally explicit connection with the biblical lemma may have been ommitted in favor of a more creative reworking. Of course, it is also possible that the author of §597 opted for a more concise formulation and therefore eliminated what he considered to be the excessive detail of the earlier tradition. A further parallel between §597 and 3 Enoch 16 is the fear which the angelic vice regent figure inspires in the human observer. §597 states that after Elisha saw Akatriel and his angelic host, he announced: \"I was alarmed, I trembled,\" while 3 Enoch states that after Aher saw Metatron and his angelic host: \"he became frightened and trembled..... his soul was alarmed\". This element of fear is completely absent from §672 and from the talmudic recensions. Indeed, these accounts do not portray Metatron in a particularly awe inspiring manner. Metatron's glorious, terrifying appearance provides the most reasonable explanation for Aher's confusion. Given this conclusion, we may reconstruct the relationship between 3 Enoch 16 and the talmudic recensions as follows.33 Initially, the tradition of Metatron's humbling was motivated by his glorious appearance, which quite reasonably caused Aher to consider him a second divinity. Indeed, in 3 Enoch 16, Aher confidently declares \"Surely there are two powers in heaven.\" As the earliest recension of the talmudic tradition, Munich 95 represents the most severe attempt to suppress any hint of Metatron's glorious appearance. In its general zeal to counteract the image of Metatron as an angelic vice regent, however, Munich 95 also eliminated any specific reason for Aher's confusion. Therefore the talmudic authors of Vaticanus 134 and Bamberg emphasized Metatron's sitting, a motif which echoed the enthronement of Metatron in the earlier tradition. The new focus on sitting had the advantage of implicitly attacking Metatron's enthronement without actually describing it in glorious terms. In contrast to the talmudic recensions, 3 Enoch 16 does not reject 33 Although I arrived at the basic elements of my reconstruction before reading Morray:Jones' article \"Hekhalot Literature and Talmudic Tradition,\" I am nevertheless indebted to his cogent model for certain detalis of my formulation."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"THE FAll OF METATRON 67 Metatron's glorious appearance and enthronement. Instead it argues that despite Metatron's godlike qualities, we should not mistake him for another god. In other words, 3 Enoch 16 accepts the image of Metatron as an enthroned vice regent but warns against confusing the angelic vice regent with another god. By contrast, the talmudic authors were entirely opposed to Metatron's glorious appearance, and therefore focused on another tradition (also linked with Enoch) that characterized Metatron as a scribe. The implicit goal of the talmudic versions is to combat Metatron's vice regency altogether. The assumptions and goals of 3 Enoch 16 and the talmudic recensions are therefore quite different, even contradictory. By suggesting this reconstruction I am not arguing that the actual text of 3 Enoch 16 is earlier than the Talmud but that its depiction preserves an earlier form of the tradition. If the relationship between 3 Enoch 16 and the talmudic tradition appears clearer, we are still faced with the equally vexing problem of the relationship between 3 Enoch 16 and §597.34 Although Elisha/ Aher is described as alarmed and trembling with fear in both 3 Enoch and §597, his subsequent reaction differs significantly in each account. In 3 Enoch 16, like in the other versions, Aher's vision is followed by his heretical declaration. By contrast, §597 preserves a stunning detail: \"I pushed myself and entered before the Holy One blessed be He.\" In other words, Elisha actually encounters God when he enters Pardes, a far more radical idea than encountering Metatron or Akatriel, no matter how glorious they are. Thus, §597 preserves the most extreme depiction of the mystical experience achieved by Elisha/ Aher. Once again, we must ask whether this feature reflects a later addition, or an earlier element which was sup-pressed in later accounts. Instead of immediately uttering a heretical \"two powers\" declaration, in §597 Elisha actually speaks with the Holy One blessed be He. This is an amazing event which recalls the relationship between God and Moses at Sinai, more than it does the relationship between God and the Merkabah mystic in the seventh hekhal. Although the tenor of Elisha's words indicates that the glorious appearance of Akatriel has troubled him, unlike in the other accounts, Elisha does not declare that there may be, or are, \"two powers\". Quite the contrary, he addresses God as the \"Master of the 34 As I mentioned above, §672 appears to be related to MS Vaticanus 134."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"68 CHAPTER FOUR world,\" and cites two carefully chosen verses from \"Your Torah\" which support the uniqueness of God's authority. The first of these verses, Deuteronomy 10:14, forms part of the divine instructions which Moses transmits to Israel following his second sojourn on Mount Sinai. If the depiction of Elisha's ascent and dialogue with God are at least partially inspired by the traditions of Moses' paradigmatic ascent and dialogue with God, then it is no accident that the author of §597 places Moses' words on Elisha's lips. Secondly, Deut. 10:14 was a common proof-text for the existence of three heavens, since it repeats the word \"heavens\" three times. 35 Why is the reference to three heavens significant? We can only answer this question if we assume that the author of §597 identified the Pardes as the third heaven. 36 Therefore, by reciting the verse, \"The heavens and heavens of heavens belong to the Lord your God,\" Elisha is arguing that all three heavens belong solely to God, rather than to God and another divine being, i.e. Akatriel. The second verse cited by Elisha is also significant. Although Elisha only cites the second half of Psalms 19:2, as is often the case, the unquoted part of the verse is at least as important: \"The heavens declare the Glory of God\". Once again the emphasis of the verse is on the sole dominion of God over the heavens. Mter reciting these verses, Elisha declares <ehad bilvad or \"only one\". In other words, rather than declaring the existence of \"two powers,\" Elisha emphasizes the uniqueness of God. Thus, Elisha challenges God to explain the incongruency between the monotheism which he knows to be true and the godlike appearance of Akatriel. In this formulation, the onus falls on God's shoulders to explain the apparant discrepency, rather than on Elisha for having hypothesized the existence of two deities or Akatriel for having appeared like another deity. This interpretation is supported by God's response to Elisha's declaration. Instead of a heavenly voice declaring \"Return, backsliding children, except Aher,\" God addresses Elisha. Although God criticizes Elisha for \"coming only to find fault,\" he acts more like a father instructing a wayward child 35 C£, for example, R. Judah's use of Deut. I 0:14 in BT Hag. 12b. 36 In]ezmsh Gnosticism, pp. 14-19, Scholem argued, largely on the basis ofparallels with Paul's account in II Corinthians, that the Pardes should be equated with the third heaven.

The specific phrasing of God's criticism of Elisha is extremely significant: \"did you come here only to find fault with my attributes [le-harher 'al middotaz]?\" As we saw above, in BT Ber. 7a, R. Ishmael prays that Akatriel's \"mercy may prevail over your other attributes [middotekha]\". Thus, the attributes or middot of mercy and justice were specifically associated with Akatriel in at least one tradition. It is possible that §597 depicts Akatriel as the hypostatic embodiment of the attributes of mercy and justice, an interpretation supported by the depiction of Akatriel as the enthroned judge from Daniel 7:10.37 Yet, in other sources, the term middot refers not to God's attributes, but to His \"measures,\" i.e. to His Shiur Qgmah. Instead of representing God's attributes, therefore, Akatriel may function as the hypostatic embodiment of God's form in §597. Whichever interpretation is correct, the jist of God's gentle rebuke of Elisha is not to condemn Akatriel (and certainly not to whip him with fiery lashes), but to difend him. In other words, §597 does not attempt to undermine the existence of an angelic vice regent but to support such a conception. It is also noteworthy that in §597 God asks Elisha whether he came \"to find fault,\" which in the original Hebrew is expressed by the verb le-harher. Above we mentioned that §672 employs the word hirher to depict the heretical activity of Elisha, i.e. \"He contemplated [hirher] that perhaps there are two powers in heaven.\" Thus, both §597 and §672 employ the same verb to describe Elisha's action in Pardes. In other sources, the term specifically refers to idolatrous or sexually impure thoughts.38 The first connotation is relevant for both §597 and §672 even though the more precise sense of the verb in the former passage is \"to find fault,\" whereas in the latter, it is \"to contemplate\".39 Is it a coincidence that both passages employ the same verb in parallel contexts, did they draw on a common tradi-tion, or did one formulation influence the other? Indeed, how can one explain the provenance of a passage which barely criticizes Elisha, defends Akatriel, and yet is clearly related to 37 N. Dahl and A.

In my opinion, the most plausible explanations are also the most radical. That is, either §597 preserves the earliest form of a tradition which was later linked with Metatron, or it represents a late attempt to rehabilitate both Elisha and the angelic being he encounters. I have already observed that §597 probably preserves at least one pre-Talmudic tradition, namely the enthronement of God's vice regent at the entrance of Paradise in the Testament rf Abraham. At present, I will examine other indications that §597 may reflect a pre-Talmudic stage of the tradition. §597 lacks the stinging portrayal of Elisha as an arch-heretic and also omits another feature which all the other accounts preserve: the identification of Elisha ben Abuya as Aher. In the talmudic recensions and 3 Enoch 16, Aher is cited throughout as the name of the individual who encounters Metatron; in §672, Elisha ben Abuya is described as seeing Metatron, and is only called Aher after his heretical \"two powers\" declaration. In §597, however, the only name mentioned is Elisha ben Abuya; Aher does not appear at all. Likewise, in all the accounts besides §597, the character who encounters Metatron is condemned by a heavenly voice with the phrase \"Return, backsliding children, except Aher.\"40 The only possible explanations for the absence of the name Aher in §597 are that the author knew of the tradition identifYing Elisha as Aher and chose to suppress it, or that he was unaware of this tradition. If the latter suggestion is correct, then the episode preserved in §597 must be older than, or somehow unaware of, all the other accounts we have examined. In addition, it must be older or unaware of the Palestinian Talmud's version of the Pardes account, since in PT Hag. 77b 11., the name Aher is already attributed to Elisha. Significantly, the Tosefta manuscripts all employ the name Elisha (except for MS Erfurt) and appear to be unaware of the name Aher. Yet, the Tosefta still condemns Elisha by declaring that: \"Elisha looked and cut the shoots.\" Unlike the Tosefta or the other accounts, §597 does not mention that Elisha/ Aher \"cut the shoots\". Once again, we must ask whether this means that §597 preserves an earlier tradition, or whether the author was unaware of, or chose to omit, this moti£ \"' The ultimate source for this quote is probably the Palestinian Talmud Hag. 77b. Significantly, the formulation in the PT does not include the name Aher, but reads \"Return, backsliding children, except for El1sha ben Abuya, for he knew my power yet rebelled against me!\""},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"THE FALL OF METATRON 71 Besides the elements which I have already discussed, there are several additional features which support an early origin for the tradition in §597. Unlike §672 or 3 Enoch 16, §597 gives no evidence of having been integrated into the Hekhalot tradition of descent to the Merkabah. 3 Enoch 16 explicitly mentions the \"seventh hekhal,\" and relates that \"Aher came to gaze on the vision of the Merkabah,\" whereas §672 states, \"when Elisha ben Abuya descended to the Merkabah\". §597 lacks any references to the Merkabah or to the Hekhalot and instead reads like a talmudic tradition in its emphasis on the Pardes, and its prolific citation of biblical proof-texts, none of which are cited in the other accounts. Therefore, we are faced with considerable evidence that §597 preserves an early tradition. Nevertheless, as I mentioned above, there is another potential solution to the problems presented by §597. Instead of preserving the earliest form of the tradition, §597 may actually represent a late composition. If so, then the author of §597 chose to suppress or simply ignore otherwise universally attested motifs (such as the name Aher, the references to \"backsliding children,\" and \"two powers,\" etc.) in order to paint an extremely different portrait of the characters involved. This portrait did not involve Metatron, but another supra-angelic being, Akatriel, who may have replaced Metatron because the author considered him to be the rightful angelic vice regent or merely because he considered Akatriel to be another name for Metatron. If it is late the formulation may reflect the work of the German Pietists, who played a critical role in the redaction and transmission of the Hekhalot material. Unlike the authors of the talmudic recensions and §672, and to an even greater degree than the author of 3 Enoch 16, the author of §597 defended the angelic vice regent in his account. The rehabilitation of the vice regent figure may have been one of the motivations for the changes made in §597. Yet, in addition to defending the vice regent, the author only mildly condemned Elisha for pointing out an apparent tension between what Elisha saw (a godlike figure) and what he knew to be the truth as stated in the Torah (the uniqueness of God). Why would the author have wanted to rehabilitate the figure of Elisha? Morray-Jones has written \"that what the talmudic redactors sought..... to suppress was a certain form of speculation concerning the angel Metatron as 'Lesser LORD' and enthroned Vice-Regent in heaven -and not the practice of heavenly ascents or Hekhalot"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"72 CHAPTER FOUR mysticism as such.\"41 Although I agree completely that the talmudic redactors wished to suppress the tradition of Metatron as enthroned vice regent, I would like to re-examine the question of whether they sought to suppress or at least undermine the practice of heavenly ascents. Clearly, the Talmud does not seek to completely suppress the practice of heavenly ascent, for it indicates that R. Akiba ascended and descended safely. Yet, by undermining the tradition of Metatron's heavenly enthronement the talmudic redactors were implicitly attacking the view that the Merkabah mystic could ascend to heaven and repeat the process of enthronement and angelification originally undergone by Enoch-Metatron. This message is reinforced by the transformation of Aher into the arch-heretic. One imagines that most people hearing or reading this account would become wary of heavenly ascent and visionary experience. If this reconstruction is correct, then the author of §597 may have rehabilitated the angelic vice regent and Elisha in order to rehabilitate a central goal of Merkabah mysticism, itself, i.e. the vision of God's Glory and the enthronement and angelification which accompanies it. Although both solutions have their merits, my own preference is for the former, namely, that §597 preserves the earliest form of a tradition which originally concerned Akatriel and only later was transferred to Metatron. My primary reason for supporting this model is its greater simplicity; futhermore, it better explains certain archaic features, such as Akatriel's enthronement at the entrance of Pardes.42 In either case, §597 raises many basic methodological questions for our understanding of Hekhalot literature. On what basis does §597 belong to the Hekhalot genre? It lacks any references to the Hekhalot or the Merkabah. It depicts an angelic figure, but so do many rabbinic passages. It describes Elisha as ascending to heaven, but the Talmud implies this as well. Indeed, as mentioned above, §597 reads more like a rabbinic passage than a Hekhalot one. My analysis has shown that it is possible to suggest a redactional sequence of the various rabbinic and Hekhalot versions of a particular tradition, yet, it is sometimes more difficult to identify the 41 \"Hekhalot Literature and Talmudic Tradition,\" p. 36. \"Although one could argue that this feature derives from 3 Enoch 16's description of Metatron at the entrance of the seventh hekhal. But why would the author of §597 have transferred the location from the entrance of the seventh hekhal to the entrance of the Pardes? Unless, of course, he was trying to create what appeared to be an early tradition. Once again, however, this is a more complicated explanation."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"THE FALL OF METATRON 73 particular genre to which a passage belongs. Essentially, the distinction between rabbinic and Hekhalot literature may be much less concrete and far more heuristic than previously accepted. As I have argued, the talmudic account of Metatron's downfall impliclity undermines the tradition of the heavenly enthronement and glorious appearance of an angelic vice regent figure. By contrast, the versions of the episode preserved in 3 Enoch 16 and §597 do not seek to negate the image of the enthroned vice regent, but rather, to warn against viewing this figure as a second God, despite his glorious appearance. Ultimately, the Vorlage for Metatron's humbling may be the biblical, intertestamental, and rabbinic tradition-complex which depicts a human or angelic being as attempting (and failing) to attain divine status. Thus, in Isaiah 14:12-15, we read: How are you fallen from heaven, 0 Shining One, Son of Dawn [Vulgate = Lucifer]. How are you felled to earth, 0 vanquisher of nations! Once you thought in your heart, \"I will climb to the sky; Higher than the stars of God I will set my throne. I will sit in the mount of assembly, On the Summit of Zaphon. I will mount the back of a cloud. I will match the Most High.\" Instead, you are brought down to Sheol, to the bottom of the Pit.\" And in Ezekiel 28:1-8: The word of the Lord came to me. 0 mortal, say to the prince of Tyre: Thus said the Lord God: \"Because you have been so haughty and have said, 'I am a god; I sit enthroned like a god in the heart of the seas,' whereas you are not a god but a man, though you deemed your mind to a god's..... they shall strike down your splendor. They shall bring you down to the Pit.\" Significantly, in a passage which recalls the dethronement of Metatron in Pardes, Ezekiel 28 links the King of Tyre with Adam:44 You were the seal of perfection, full of wisdom and flawless in beauty. You were in Eden, the garden of God ..... I created you as a cherub with outstretched shielding wings ..... You grew haughty because of your beauty, you debased your wisdom for the sake of your splendor. I have cast you to the ground. 43 On the mythological background of Isaiah 14, cf B. S.

Indeed, the talmudic authors may have viewed Metatron as a contemporary version of the \"Son of Dawn\"/\"King of Tyre\".46 Accordingly, they ensured that like his biblical predecessors, Metatron was dethroned by God and his divinity explicitly rejected. Further inspiration for the demotion of Metatron may have come from the well attested intertestamental tradition of a Fallen Angel whose sin involved heavenly enthronement.47 Thus, in 2 Enoch 29, we read that: \"one from the order of angels, having turned away with the order that was under him, conceived an impossible thought, to place his throne higher than the clouds above the earth, that he might become equal in rank to my power. And I threw him out from the height.\"48 Besides the common motif of angelic enthronement and forcible dethronement, the link between Metatron and the fallen 45 As several scholars have argued, the tradition of the fallen angel may ultimat-tely derive from the ancient Canaanite figure of Athtar, who attempted to fill the throne of Baal but failed and subsequently had to descend and rule the underworld.

David Halperin, \"Ascension or Invaswn: Implications of the Heavenly Journey in Ancient Judaism,\" Religion 18, 1988, interprets the ascension trachtions concerning Moses and Metatron as positive structural variations of the negative tradition of Lucifer's ascent and subsequent downfall.

Metatron carries Moses' succes to a degree that matches Lucifer's fantasies.\" Halperin does not mention the traditiOn of Metatron's own demotion, which seems to echo the downfall of Lucifer.

As a segue into the next chapter, a final parallel to the downfall of Metatron may be found in Gnostic traditions concerning the Demiurge or what Nils Dahl has called \"The Myth of the Arrogant Ruler\".49 As Dahl and other scholars have argued, the downfall of the Gnostic Demiurge, commonly known as Ialdabaoth, Samael, or Saklas, is also related to the forementioned biblical and inter-testamental traditions concerning the haughty human or angelic being who falsely claims to be a god. Like Metatron, the Demiurge is rebuked in a number of Gnostic texts by \"a voice from above\" which declares: \"You are mistaken, Samael,\" or \"Do not lie, Ialdabaoth.\"50 Unlike the Aher/Metatron tradition which emphasizes the unique authority of the biblical God, the Gnostic sources actually seek to undermine the God of the Bible by identifYing him with the Demiurge51 The point of the Aher /Metatron tradition is to differentiate Metatron from the God of Judaism; the point of the Gnostic sources is to differentiate the God of Israel (i.e. the Demiurge) from the higher God of the Pleroma. Despite their divergent theologies, the Gnostic and Jewish sources resemble one another in a very important respect: both function as polemics against a lower figure who may be easily mistaken for the one, true God. In the next chapter, I will examine two vice regent figures, Sabaoth and Abathur, who like Akatriel in §597 and Metatron in 3 Enoch 16, are depicted as judges enthroned at the entrance of the divine dwelling. The existence of this cross cultural phenomenon may have influenced the authors of the Talmudic version of the Aher /Metatron tradition to polemicize against such a figure within Jewish circles. The closeness of the Hekhalot depictions of Metatron 49 Cf. Dahl, \"The Arrogant Archon,\" pp. 701ff. Cf., also, Fallon, The Enthronement qf Sabaoth, pp. 26ff.; Bernard Bare, L'Hypostase des Archontes: Traite Gnostique sur L'Origine de L'Homme du Monde et des Archontes (NH II, 1), Quebec/Louvain, 1980, p. 34. 50 C£ Hyposlas!s qf the Archons 86:32-87:4; 94:24-26; 95:5-7; On the Origin qf the World 103:15-18; Irenaeus, Haer. 1.30.6.

As Dahl writes: \"The mythopoetic polemic is not directed against an earthly ruler, against the symbohc or eschatological adversary of the people of God, or agamst the religious hero of a heretical group, but against the God of monotheistic opponents.\""},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"76 CHAPTER FOUR and Akatriel to the Gnostic and Mandaean traditions could easily have raised the suspicions of the Talmud's authors. Rather than explicitly declaring that belief in an enthroned vice regent was heretical, however, they may have formulated a far more subtle attack. Even in his avatar as a scribe allowed to sit in heaven to write down Israel's merits and not as a glorious, enthroned vice regent, Metatron was a dangerous figure, whose appearance could cause confusion and lead to heresy. Aher then becomes the symbol of those Jews whose ditheistic or binitarian belief in an angelic vice regent too closely resembles the beliefs of Gnostics and Mandaeans. Perhaps even the reference to \"no standing and no sitting,\" appearing in the earliest Talmudic manuscripts reflects this polemical context for as Michael Williams has shown, standing was a positive sign of stability in many Gnostic sources.52 As Zostrianos declares, \"I became a root-seeing angel and stood upon the first aeon which is the fourth ..... I stood upon the second aeon which is the third ..... I stood upon the third aeon which is the second.\" (.{ostrianos 6:20-7:1 0) Thus, in its most conservative formulation the Talmudic episode attacks both heavenly enthronement and the tradition of standing in heaven, actions which are linked to angelification or divinization in Gnostic and Hekhalot sources alike. I conclude this discussion with a final tradition concern,ing Metatron. The passage appears in the midrashic collection called Lamentations Rabbah and follows a description of God lamenting the descruction of the Temple in Jerusalem and the exile of his Shekinah: At that moment Metatron entered and fell on his face and said before Him, \"Master of the Universe, I will cry so that you don't have to cry.\" He [God] replied, \"If you don't let me cry now I will enter a place where you don't have the authority [reshut] to enter and I will cry, as it is said, \"If you do not heed, My soul will weep in the secret places because of your arrogance ITeremiah 13:17]. (Lamentations Rabbah 24) In this poignant encounter, Metatron bows down to God as a sign of respect, a sharp contrast to his action in the Aher/Metatron tradition. At first glance, Metatron's suggestion that he weep in God's stead appears to reflect positively on Metatron: he IS volunteering to perform an activity which is either painful or 52 :Michael Williams, The Immovahl£ Race: A Gnostu Dmgnatwn and the Theme qf Stability, Leiden, 1985."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"THE FALL OF METATRON 77 inappropriate for God. And yet God's response hints that Metatron may have overstepped his boundaries once again. Rather than accepting Metatron's offer, God tells Metatron that unless he leaves him in peace, God will retreat to a place where Metatron is unable (lit. does not have the \"authority\") to follow. The Hebrew term used is the same word employed by Aher in his infamous \"two powers\" statement. Whether or not we hear an echo of the Aher /Metatron tradition in God's response, it is clear that Metatron has been rebuked for assuming too much authority. This is also suggested by the biblical proof text which in the original context refers to Israel's \"arrogance\" as the source of God's sadness, while in the midrashic re-reading Metatron's arrogance has become the catalyst for God removing himself to a hidden place to cry. Once again, Metatron has literally been put in this place. Indeed, this powerful passage argues that God, rather than Metatron -the angel typically in charge of Israel -will personally mourn for the destruction of his Temple and the exile of his Presence from his people. By affirming that God, and not Metatron, will mourn, the text rejects the importance of intermediaries and argues instead for the primacy of the direct relationship between God and Israel, even as it describes the catastrophe (the destruction of the Temple) which threatens this relationship. Thus, we have seen texts which treat Metatron as a positive symbol of the human ability to breach the distance with God, others which understand Metatron as a threat to what they consider the proper boundaries between God and his creatures, and still others which imply that Metatron functions as an obstacle in the way of a direct relationship between God and people, as in this final passage."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"CHAPTER F1VE ABATHUR'S LAMENT Like Merkabah mysticism, Mandaeism and Gnosticism developed their own myths of vice regency, incorporating many of the same themes and transforming a common pool of biblical and apocalyptic traditions. As in the case of the Jewish sources, Gnostic and Mandaean texts depict the vice regent as a figure who both crosses and reinforces boundaries and categories. Examining these traditions, we encounter similar motifs of ascension and transformation, expulsion and rehabilitation. In the following chapters, I will focus on two vice regent figures, Abathur and Sabaoth. Because the Gnostic figure Sabaoth and the texts he appears in have already been examined in great detail, I will emphasize in particular his parallels with Metatron and Abathur. By contrast, I will provide an extensive portrait of the Mandaean figure Abathur, who has received relatively little scholarly attention until now. Many early scholars of Mandaean literature, including Eric Lidzbarski, Richard Reitzenstein and Rudolph Bultman postulated a pre-Christian, Palestinian origin for Mandaeism. 1 This view gains support from the The Haran Gawaita, which contains the Mandaean's own account of their forced migration from Palestine to Mesopotamia. More recently, Kurt Rudolph has suggested a 'jewish, Palestine, Pre-Christian\" theory of Mandaean origin/ and has written that \"Even the oldest form of that which we today call Mandeism was a splintering off from official Judaism.\"3 Edwin Yamauchi has offered the strongest challenge to this position, arguing instead that the origin of Mandaeism lies in a Transjordan or \"western proto-Mandaean component\" of \"non:Jews\" (possibly sharing an ideology similar to that of the Elchasai sect), who migrated to Mesopotamia and combined their form of Gnosticism 1 For discussions of the various positions see Kurt Rudolph, \"Problems of a History of the Development of the Mandaean Religion,\" History of Religions 8, 1969, pp. 210-234.

The Ginza and Book rif]ohn were first redacted in the early Islamic period. The earliest figure appearing in the colophons of Mandaean works is a scribe named Zazai d'Gawazta, son ofNatar and Hawwa, who is said to have copied the hymns in the Canonical Prayerbook \"from the scroll of the first life.\"7 Many Mandaean scrolls written in the medieval period and later claim to trace their origin to this figure, who lived in the second half of the third century CE. The systematic analysis of the Mandaean colophons is currently being undertaken by Jorunn Jacobsen Buckley, whose work will undoubtedly shed much light on the deve-lopment of Mandaean literature. The highly redacted nature of Mandaean literature recalls the literary character of Hekhalot texts which, as Peter Schafer has 4 Yamauchi, Pre-Christian Gnosticism, pp.140-42. 5 On the critical study of Mandaean literature, see Svend Aage Pallis, Essay on Mandaean Bibliography 1560-1930, London/Copenhagen, 1933; Rudo1fMacuch, Zur Sprach und Literatur der Mandder: Mit Beitriigen von K Rudolph und E.

In response to the complex nature of Mandaean sources, scholars have developed a number of criteria for determining the age and compositional mileu of specific literary units. These critical indicators include the mention of baptismal practices, Jewish doctrines and practices, polemical references, parallels with Gnostic and Christian literature, and linguistic usages.8 Generally, the correlation between Mandaean practices and beliefs with those of early baptismal groups such as the Elchasites is taken as an indication of an early, that is, pre-Islamic, or even pre-Christian origin. Likewise, parallels between Mandaean and Jewish, Christian and/ or Gnostic sources are often interpreted as signs of an early date. The presence of polemics against Christianity and Judaism, but not against Islam, is considered an indication of a pre-Islamic provenance. By contrast, the use of Arabic names, rather than their traditional Mandaic counterparts, (e.g. Allah, for the high-est God; Yahyii, for John) may signify a post-Islamic date. Unfortunately, the determination of a particular literary unit's date and provenance on the basis of these criteria often proves to be highly problematic. For example, the conspicuous absence of a polemic against Islam may have more to do with the fear of Moslem reprisal than a pre-Islamic origin, while the use of an Arabic n;lme such as Yahyii instead of the Mandaic YOhannii, may indicate a late redactional change made to a compositionally early passage. Because of this uncertainty, many scholars have focused on reconstructing the phenomenological character of Mandaean religion, rather than its precise literary development. As Kurt Rudolph has written: It is very difficult to get a clear picture of these religious ideas from Mandaean literature...... It has therefore not yet been possible to reconstruct the evolution of Mandaean ideas from their earliest beginnings with any certainty. Here, I can do no more than to give a short phenomenological outline of the main current of religious ideas in this literature. 9 Elsewhere, however, Rudolph has argued that certain pheno-menological criteria may help us ascertain the evolution of Mandaean theology. In his opinion, the chief phenomenological 8 On the related issues of dating Mandaean literary sources and the Mandaeans, themselves, see the survey in Edwin Yamauchi, Gnostic Ethics and Mandaean Origins, pp. 4-10. 9 Kurt Rudolph, Mandaeism, Leiden, 1978, p. 12."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"ABATHUR'S LAMENT 81 shift in Mandaean theology is from an earlier radical dualism to a more monistic view, a hypothesis which I will examine more closely below.10 Despite the great variety of Mandaean traditions, Rudolph cautions that Mandaeism \"cannot be characterized as a simple mosaic of individual sects or ideas. It is, as Macuch recently emphasized again, a 'unified phenomenon\"'.11 In examining the Mandaean figure of Abathur, I will adopt both of Rudolph's methodological principles, namely, his focus on phenomenology and his acceptance of the underlying coherence of Mandaean sources. One of the unifying themes of Mandaean theology is its emphasis on the divine and semi-divine beings who populate the various levels of the Mandaean universe. Although studies of Mandaean religion have never kept pace with the plethora of Mandaean theological figures, a number of works have been devoted to examining particular beings. The Mandaean Primal Adam or Anthropos has until now received the most scholarly attention, with relevant studies produced by Kraeling, Drower, Quispel, and Cohn-Sherbok.12 Although Kraeling noted the parallels between the Mandaean Anthropos andJewish and Gnostic traditions, he traced the origin of the phenomenon to Iranian religion. By contrast, more recent studies have emphasized the dependence of the Mandaean figure on Jewish conceptions. Earlier in the century, when scholars were more intent on showing the influence of Mandaeism on early Christianity, the Mandaean figure of John the Baptist and the saviour figure Enosh were frequently compared with Christian portrayals of Jesus.13 In roughly 10 Cf.

More recently, Kurt Rudolph has devoted large portions of his now classic Theogonie, Kosmogonie und Anthropogonie in den mandiiischen Schrijten, to examining the various actors in the Mandaean cosmogonic drama. Finally, mention must be made of the current work being done by Jorunn Jacobsen Buckley, who has devoted a number of highly interesting studies rehabilitating the often maligned figure of Ruha. 15 It should be stressed that Abathur is not the only Mandaean figure who possesses characteristics of a vice regent. For example, Hibil Ziwa, Manda d'Hiyya, and Ptahil each have vice regent features, some of which have already been noted in earlier studies.16 Nevertheless, Abathur not only possesses the greatest number of encountered in the area around Basra during the 17th century, they referred to them as \"Christiani S.

On p. 239, Segelberg speculates that the reason \"why Jesus Christ was never received and absorbed and 'Mandaeized\"' was that the Mandaeans were \"a strongly Jewish influenced Gnostic sect\" who lived in close con-tact with Syrian Christianity. Thus, \"The knowledge of Jesus Christ was too much alive in their surroundings to allow a Mandaean transformation.\" \" Carl Kraeling, \"The Mandaic God Ptahil,\" Journal if the American Oriental Society 53, 1933. 15 See].

On p. xxxix, Greenfield writes, \"The parallels which he [Odeberg] offered are mostly verbal and are on the whole meaningless.\" While Greenfield correctly characterizes many of Odeberg's suggestions, he is too broad in his criticism. In sev-eral instances, Odeberg illuminates valid comparative issues by juxtaposing parallel passages from Mandaean literature and 3 Enoch. Unfortunately, Odeberg's own analysis of these passages is incomplete. See also Fossum's discussion of Ptahil in The Name if God and the Angel if the Lord, pp. 261-263. Fossum stresses the Mandaean identification of Ptahil with the archangel Gabriel, and argues that the Mandaean concept of the demiurge Gabriel must derive from Jewish sources, contra Rudolph (following S.

The stages of divine emanation are commonly referred to as the \"Second,\" \"Third,\" and \"Fourth Life,\" but are also known by the corresponding personal names Yoshamin, Abathur, and Ptahil. As the Canonical Prayer Book qf the Mandaeans states, \"The First Life is anterior to the Second Life by six thousand myriad years and the Second Life anterior to the Third Life by six thousand myriad years and the Third Life more ancient than any 'uthra by six thousand myriad years.\"18 Together these divine beings make up the World of Light (alme d'nhura). Parallel to the World of Light is a World of Darkness (alme d'hshuka), inhabited by a pantheon of beings including the ambivalent female figure Ruha and her monstrous son 'Ur. As the light is emanated, its quality decreases, so that the Second Life is inferior to the First Life, and so forth. In a number of sources, a process of devolution occurs as the Second Life (Y oshamin) turns towards the World of Darkness.

By gazing below, Abathur commits an act of extreme hubris and even rebellion, for the proper focus of the emanated beings is on the Great Life, above. Like Sophia's rebellion in the western Gnostic mythos, Abathur's gazing results in the creation of the demiurge, Ptahil, who forms the physi-cal world (tibiO. As the Ginza Raba states: Abathur arose, opened the gate (of the World of Light) and gazed into the black waters; and immediately his counterpart was formed in the black waters. Ptahil was formed and ascended to the boundary...... Abathur instructed him and said: 'Arise, my son, condense a condensation in the black water.'19 In another version of the cosmogonic drama, the rebellious charac-ter of Abathur's action is emphasized: B'haq-Ziwa [i.e. Abathur] shone by himself, and he held himself to be a mighty one. He held himself to be a mighty one and abandoned the name that his father had called him by. And he spoke: \"I am the father of the uthras. The father of the uthras am I, I made shkinas for the uthras.\" He contemplated the turbid water and said: \"I shall call forth a world.\" He took no advice and did not perceive the turbid water. He called Ptahil-Uthra, embraced him, and kissed him like a mighty one. He bestowed names on him, which are hidden and protected in their place. He gave him the name \"Gabriel, the Messenger,\" he called him, commanded, and spoke to him: \"Arise, go, descend to the place where there are no shkinas or worlds. Call forth and create a world for yourself, just like the sons of perfection, whom you saw.\"20 As a result of his rebellious involvement in the creation, Abathur is condemned as the one \"from whom imperfection originated, from him imperfection came into being and he sowed bad seed [i.e. Ptahil].

Following this event, Abathur is installed at the entrance of the World of Light, where he receives a new throne and functions as the weigher and judge of human souls, as The Canonical Proyerbook declares, \"he [Abathur] is fallen from his throne, why from his throne he is fallen and went and become Him-of-the-Scales\".22 Another text, recently published by Jorunn Jacobsen Buckley, called The Scroll qf Exalted Kingship (Diwan Malkuta 'Laita), describes Abathur's fall from grace as follows: \"So Abatur Rama, whose child is the world, is degraded from his throne, degraded, and he went to become 'He-of-the-Scales. \"'23 Abathur's Dethronement The most dramatic account of Abathur's installation as the weigher of souls is preserved in the Mandaean Book qf]ohn, in a section called \"Abathurs Klage\" (Abathur's Lament) by Lidzbarski.24 Mter being ordered to leave his pleromatic home and take up the position of judge and weigher of souls, Abathur complains, \"Why have you 21 The Canonical Prayerbook, p; 198.

The location of Abathur's new throne is described in The Canonical Prayerbook, p. 7, as follows: \"[Abathur's] throne is placed at the gate of the House of Life\". In E. S. Drower, The Thousand and Twelve Qyestions (A!fTrisar Shuialia), Berlin, 1960, p. 163 (English); p. 45 (Mandaic), Abathur is locat-ed below the treacherous waters which separate the World of Light from the vari-ous \"watchhouses\" or mattarta, which function as waystations or purgatories for the ascending soul: \"And the world of Abathur is below the world of the outflowing waters [luifiqia mia], and the world of outflowing waters below the world of the pure Yushamin.\" 23 J.

I have been forced out from my shkina, so that my world is destroyed and desecrated and is deprived to me.\"25 Hibil Ziwa, a divine emissary, then ascends to his father, the Life (a name for the highest god) and informs him that Abathur has refused to assume his position as weigher of souls or Scaleman. Upon hearing this, the King (i.e. Life or Great Life) becomes angry and calls out two times, only to have his call muffied by the shkinas. The third time the King calls out, a lesser being (Sam) responds that he will assume the position of Scaleman. The King responds to Sam's suggestion by calling him a fool and declaring that \"Abathur is called, who is a gentle uthra.\" Section 72 begins with a confrontation between Abathur and the Mana. 26 Once again, Abathur asks why he has been chosen from among all the uthras. Mana responds that \"Among all the shkinas and uthras there is none like you. None in these light worlds, who would be so gentle as you. You are gentle and you are a qualified uthra. You are so courageous and you are a bullwark to the souls. You feel sympathy with the souls and you are an acceptable judge.\" To this Abathur responds that Hibil Ziwa should be judge and he will be Scaleman. The account concludes with a confusing series of role reversals between Hibil Ziwa and Abathur. Upon discovering that Abathur has convinced Hibil Ziwa to become the weigher of souls while he, Abathur, has assumed Hibil Ziwa's role as king of the shkinas, the Great Life throws Abathur off his throne: Mter that Abathur said to Mana: \"Tell Hibil-Ziwa, that he will be the judge and I will be the Scaleman. So then Hibil Ziwa-Yawar turned to Abathur and said: \"If I become judge, who should maintain the shkinas? If I become judge who should become king in these worlds?\" To that Abathur answered, \"I will become king, and I will maintain the shkinas.\" When Abathur said this, Hibil-Yawar clenched and became the Scaleman. (When Hibil-Ziwa said this), the Great Life took him into the Good and against Abathur did the Great Life become full of anger. The Great Life came and threw him [Abathur] off his throne and placed him by the gate of the Sufat 25 Ibid., p. 233. In Mandaean cosmology, the uthras or divine beings of the World of Light inhabit dwelling places called \"shkinas\". \"Here, the name Mana may refer to the highest god, i.e. Life, Great Life, King, cf. Lidzbarski's comments in ib1d., p. 233, n. 8. Otherwise, the term may designate an individual member of a class of heavenly beings, cf. Rudolph's comments in Gnosis: A Selection qf Texts, p. 146."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"ABATHUR'S LAMENT 87 [lbaba d'szifat]. \"Go,\" he said to him, \"be the judge, as long as the Great [Life] desires it from you.\"\" This version of Abathur's dethronement has much in common with the dethronement of Metatron in the Jewish sources I examined above. In both traditions, an enthroned figure who threatens the proper divisions within the cosmic hierarchy is punished by being forced off his throne. Synopse §672, in particular, parallels the Mandaean account since Metatron is exiled outside of Pardes and placed at its entrance, just as Abathur is placed at the gate of the Sufat: \"Immediately they brought out Metatron to outside the Curtain (Pargod) and struck him with sixty fiery lashes.\" In both Mandaean and Merkabah accounts, enthronement functions as the most potent symbol of divine authority. Dethronement, therefore, serves an opposite function, signifying that a lower divine figure does not have the same power or authority as God. In their desire to go beyond their own status and imitate God, Abathur and Metatron are guilty of hubris. This emerges explicitly in the Mandaean account, where Abathur declares that he seeks to become \"king of the shkinas,\" and implicitly in the Jewish sources where Metatron does not stand up when he sees Aher. The relationship between Abathur and Hibil Ziwa in this text is confusing, probably reflecting the fact that although the two figures are often portrayed as separate beings in Mandaean literature (indeed, they interact with one another in a number of places), in some sources it appears that Hibil Ziwa and Abathur are actually the same being, a phenomenon already noted by Drower.28 Thus, for example, the Diwan Abatur alternately depicts Ptahil as the son of Abathur and of Hibil Ziwa. \"Abathur's Lament\" appears to flirt with the idea that Abathur and Hibil Ziwa are identical beings and that they are separate. A final point concerns the depiction of Hibil Ziwa as a judge and weigher of souls in \"Abathur's Lament\". Hibil is the Mandaean version of the biblical name Abel. In the Testament qf Abraham, a text with many parallels with the Aher /Metatron tradition, Abel is depicted as an enthroned judge, surrounded by angels who record 27 \"Sufat\" is the name of an undetworld. See E. S. Drower and R. Macuch, A Mandaic .Dtctwnary, Oxford, 1963, p. 323. 28 E. S. Drower, The Mandaea:ns qf Iraq and Ira:n, p. 95, n. 4, where she refers to \"Abathur Rama, an epithet for Hibil Ziwa,\" and \"Hibil Ziwa, sometimes identified with Abathur\"."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"88 CHAPTER F1VE and weigh the souls: \"And the wondrous man [Abel] who sat on the throne was the one who judged and sentenced the souls ... And the one [Dokiel] who was in front of the table, who was holding the balance, weighed the souls.\"29 This same cluster of themes appears in \"Abathur's Lament,\" where the functions of judging and weighing souls pass back and forth between Abathur and Hibil-Ziwa. As in the case of the Aher /Metatron tradition, it is possible that such parallels are coincidental or that The Testament qf Abraham influenced the formulation of the Mandaean tradition concerning a cosmic figu-re named Hiwil (=Abel), enthroned in heaven as a judge. Abathur as Priest Although \"Abathurs Lament\" preserves the tradition of Abathur's exile from the World of Light, it does not portray Abathur in an entirely negative light. Abathur is a rebellious divine figure, but, as Rudolph has noted in his analysis of the account, Abathur is also characterized in more positive priestly terminology and imagery. Thus, for example, the depiction of Abathur as a \"king of the shkinas\" echoes the common Mandaean tradition of referring to priests by the title of \"king\" (malka).30 In his study of heavenly baptism and enthronement in Mandaeism, Geo Widengren has argued that the Mandaean depiction of the priest as king ultimately derives from Jewish sources such as Test. Levi 8:1-12, where the enthroned priest is described in royal imagery. As Widengren writes: \"We are reminded of the fact that the priest also is called malka, king [in Mandaean writings].\"31 Abathur's priestly 29 \"Testament of Abraham,\" Recension A, ch. 12, in The Old Testament Pseu-depigrapha, p. 889. \"' C£ Theogonie, Kosmogonie und Anthropogonie, p. 136, n. 1. The characterization of human and heavenly priests as \"kings\" is most evident in the Mandaean text The Coronation if the Great Sislam, cf. E.S. Drawer, The Coronation if the Great Sislam.

Thus, for example, in the text known as 17ze Great 'First WoruF, the earthly priest is instructed: \"And when thou sayest 'thou shalt go and reach the guard-house of four beings, sons of perfection' those are the four ritual handclasps (kushtas) which Abathur seeks to exchange with the soul.\"32 And, even more strikingly, in 17ze Lesser 'First World', we read: And when thou takest the iron knife into thy hand, thou hast placed Ptahil's hand into Abatur's hand with (thy) right hand. And when thou takest the sheep or the dove, and turnest thy face towards the Gate of Prayer, Abatur-of-the-Scales gazes upon thee.\" Indeed, there is a direct correspondence between the rituals performed by the priests on earth, and the heavenly rituals performed by the priestly uthras. On the one hand, as E. S. Drawer has argued, \"the rites and sacraments which, performed in the ether-world by 'uthras, were to serve as archetypes for earthly baptisms, masses, and commemorations.\"34 On the other hand, the relationship between the earthly and heavenly rituals appears to be theurgical, that is, the actions of the human priests actually influence parallel behavior in the divine realm. Thus, at one point in the priestly ritual known as the Tabahata--masiqta (\"Parents' Death-Mass\"), the earthly priests exchange the handshake or kushta and declare: \"May Kushta strengthen you, my brother-'uthras! The living have been joined in communion, just as 'uthras in their shkintas are joined in communion. Pleasing is your fragrance, my brothers, in your innermost, that is all full of radiance.\"35 In another ritual, this time the initiation of the low level priest or tarmida, the relationship between the actions of human priests and the light beings (including Abathur) is spelled out as follows: \"When enthronement rites.

J. Buckley eloquently expresses this dialectic between earthly and heavenly actions in Mandaean myth and ritual: The presentation of the masiqta shows that spoken words accompanied by pertinent acts have a creative effect and that these words and acts affect the upper worlds. Modelled after the rituals of the primordial beings in the Light-world, the priests' actions 'recreate' these ceremonies. The Light-beings sent down prayers and rituals so that they might be carried out on earth. But the 'uthria themselves perform these rituals above, too. This reciprocity breaks the borderlines between Light-world and earth, and the earthly rituals 'work' because the priests are, essentially, 'uthria on earth. 37 Along with Abathur, other divine figures who are frequently portrayed as priests in Mandaean mythology include Y oshamin and Ptahil, whom I will discuss below, the Secret Adam or Adam Kasia, who is portrayed as the First Priest, and Sislam Raba, who is depicted as the chief archetype of proper priesthood. 38 As Drawer has noted, a major valence of the priesthood is its mediating function between the World of Light and the world ofmatter.39 It should not come as a surprise, therefore, that Abathur is portrayed as a priest, since intermediation is the chief characterisitic of the angelic vice regent. Just as Metatron's priestly role in the heavenly tabernacle serves as a model for the earthly priesthood, so Abathur's priestly activity is a paradigm for that of his human counterparts. It may be argued that, in contrast to Mandaeism, the earthly priesthood in Judaism no longer functioned during the period when even the earliest Metatron literature was produced. Nevertheless, there is evidence that the mystics who produced the Hekhalot literature identified themselves as spiritual or (in the case of R.

Ishmael is His (priestly) servant on earth, as Metatron is His servant on high. As I noted above, Kurt Rudolph has argued that Mandaean sources reflect a chronological (and phenomenological) shift from an earlier dualism to a later monism. One example of this shift, according to Rudolph, is that earlier sources which portray the cosmogony as the rebellious work of Abathur, Ptahil and the forces of chaos, give way to sources which depict the creation as the work of an angel commissioned by a representative of the Great Life. 41 An equally important, and related, element in this shift is what Rudolph refers to as a process of \"clericalization\" and \"ritualization\".42 According to Rudolph, as time passed, Mandaean literature and rituals increasingly became the patrimony of an emerging priestly elite. 43 An important element in the trends toward monism and the empowerment of the priesthood, was the rehabilitation of previously condemned heavenly priests, such as Y oshamin and Abathur. As Rudolph writes: \"Out of celestial beings come types of celestial priests; the erring and then rehabilitated priest is an especially favorite theme of this kind.\"44 There is a definate connection between the mythological theme of \"erring and then rehabilitated\" celestial priests such as Abathur and the Mandaean rituals for the rehabilitation of human priests. As Drawer has noted, the purpose of these scrolls is precisely \"to discover what must be done to atone for errors in recitation or ritual or to find out what will restore to office a priest who has incurred pollution or committed an involuntary crime against rituallaw.\"45 The rehabilitation of Abathur therefore functions as a model and even a justification for the rehabilitation of the human priesthood and vice versa. 41 See Theogonie, Kosmogonie und Anthropogonu, pp. 97ff. 42 Rudolph, Die Mandaer, II: Der Kult, pp. ll9ff., 136, 138, 196, 213, 341-342. \" See \"Problems of a History of the Development of the Mandaean Religion,\" p. 234, \"This clerical elite, if one may put it thus, reserved for itself special docu-ments, that is, wrote works of this sort, as its property, a development wh1ch was utterly foreign to ancient Mandeism since there everyone was a Mandaean who attached himself to the community.\" 44 Ibid., pp. 233-234.

The Scroll qf Exalted !Gngship warns the initiate not to err as Yoshamin and Abathur did: \"be warned and beware of the works (or: 'rites') that Yushamin performed! (For he did not put on his crown. Abatur divided it (i.e. the ritual?) into three kinds; it became useless. The great mystery of seed and the three mysteries of distress departed from his intelligence and they took their course (which is) from Abatur. He became small and unimportant and went to become 'He-of-the Scales.\"'46 In one hymn from The Canonical Prayerbook, the human being asks for forgiveness of his own sins and then declares that Y oshamin, Abathur, and Ptahil will be forgiven for their transgressions as well (once again emphasizing the correlation between heavenly and human beings): Forgive the sins, trespasses, follies, stumblings and mistakes of him who made (furnished) this bread, m(JSUjta and tabuta. His sins, trespasses, follies, stumblings and mistakes you will remit for him, my lord Manda-d-Hiia and Great First Life, (those of) the donor of fee and oblation. For our forefathers there shall be forgiving of sins. For Yushamin son of Demut-Hiia there shall be forgiveness of sins. For Abatur son of Bihrat there shall be forgiveness of sins ...... For Ptahil son of Zahriel there shall be forgiveness of sins. 47 In her analysis of The Scroll qf Exalted Kinship, Buckley argues for an internal debate within Mandaean literature over the rehabilitation of primordial priests. Early texts like Canonical Prayerbook 243 and the following passage from the Ginza emphasize that the rehabilitation of Y oshamin, Abathur, and Ptahil will only occur at the final judgement: The works of the Tibil [the earth] will fall into disorder, [on the Day of Judgement] and the whole firmament will be shaken. Then Yoshamin, Abathur, and Ptahil come and see this world. Groaning seizes their heart, and they beat themselves on the breast. They behold the container of souls which lies completely corrupted on the ground (?). On that great day of judgement sentence will be pronounced on Yoshamin, Abathur, and Ptahil. Then Hibil-Ziwa comes and lifts them from this world.\"48 46 The Scroll rf Exalted Kingshzp, p. 53. On p. 96, Buckley notes concerning Abatur's wrongdoing in this passage, \"Precisely what Abathur has done wrong in dividing the ritual (?) into three parts remains unclear.\" \" The Canomcal Prayerbook, p. 151. Hymns 237 and 243 of the collection (cf. Drower's comments on p. 214) also deal with the rehabiliation of Yoshamin, Abathur, and despite his initial reluctance, Ptahil. 48 Ginza, p. 311.

To wit: the activity of priest-creating inevitably conjures up the somber lessons of the primordial priests/ 'utras who went astray. When Hibil Ziwa pleads for forgiveness regarding Abatur, \"place your right hands on him!,\" he advocates lenience toward sinning priest-colleagues, a lenience that the Great Life was not ready to extend to Abatur in CP [Canonical Prayerbook] 243. This is an example of Mandaean inter-textual criticism -the author of DM'L seems to feel that the Great Life in CP 243 was too stern, a attitude that should be softened with regard to faux pas committed by earthly priests!' In a passage from the Mandaean Book rif John, a messenger from the Great Life informs Y oshamin that he will be re-enthroned in the World of Light: \"Your throne is firmly erected as it was, and you will be called a king in your shkina.\"50 There is an analogy between the rehabilitation and enthronement of Y oshamin in this passage and the ascent and heavenly enthronement of the human soul in Mandaean sources.51 As The Canonical Prayerbook declares: \"For thee [the human soul] a throne of rest is set up in which there is no heat and wrath.\"52 This process recalls the Jewish traditions I examined above, where the ascent, enthronement, and angelification of Enoch-Metatron serves as a paradigm for the similar transformation of the Merkabah mystic. Abathur and Metatron In a number of passages, Abathur expresses his desire for rehabilitation by pleading with a representative from the World of Light to deliver a favourable report concerning him to the Great Life. This theme is eloquently depicted in a passage from the Ginza Raba, which also reveals a number of remarkable parallels between Abathur and Metatron: 49 The Scroll of Exalted Kingshzp, p. 90. 50 Das Johannesbuch, p. 40; Widengren, \"Heavenly Enthronement and Baptism,\" p. 562, analyzes this passage. \"Ibid. 52 Canomcal Prayerbook, p. 96.

Thousand upon thousand [stand there] with their eyes upon him, and ten thousand upon ten thousand stand before him [at his service). They raise his throne which is high and upon which he sits. When Abathur saw Manda d'Hiia, he stood up from his throne. Then spoke Manda d'Hiia to Abathur: 'Stay, stay, Abathur. Sit on your throne, which is high, magnificent and fortified, which the Great Life on High has granted to you.' At that, Abathur spoke to Manda d'Hiia: 'When you go, make mention of me in the presence of the Life.' Then Manda d'Hiia spoke to Abathur: 'When I ascend and speak and deliver a favorable report, then two angels will come from on High. They will lift up the high curtain [bargod] between the end of your shkzna and the Great Life. They will inform you and speak to you and they will inform and say to the Great Life that Manda d'Hiia has ascended on high and Abathur has administered kushta. 53 In the Mandaean account, Abathur rises from his throne in order to show respect for Manda d-hiia, whereas in the Jewish sources Metatron neglects to rise from his throne when he sees Aher. A heavenly voice delivered by two angels breaches the curtain (bargod) and informs Abathur that he has correctly and respectfully performed his duties. By contrast, in the Jewish sources, a heavenly voice comes from beyond the curtain (pargod) to condemn Aher.54 Like Metatron, Abathur is depicted as an enthroned judge surrounded by thousands and tens of thousands of angels, a striking parallel to the atiqyomin of Daniel 7:9-10.55 I am not arguing for the influence of one tradition on the other but rather for a similar combination of tropes. The connection between Abathur and the atiq yomin is confirmed by another text in which a hybrid being named Denanuxt (whom Lidzbarski describes as \"ein Mittelding zwischen Mensch und Buch\")56 ascends through the seven heavenly watchhouses until he reaches the highest of them, that of Abathur: Winds, winds took away Denanuxt, storms, storms led him away, ladders, ladders carry him upwards and make him ascend on steps. They make him ascend and erected him in the W atchhouse of Abathur, the ancient, high, hidden and preserved one.

Indeed, the Mandaean passage employs a number of parallels with terms from Daniel 7, including the Mandaic term for \"ancient\" or atiqa and the term for \"throne\" or kursia. The depiction of Abathur surrounded by angelic beings with crowns on their heads also recalls 3 Enoch 16, where Aher sees Metatron \"seated upon a throne like a king\" surounded by ministering angels and \"all the princes of kingdoms crowned with crowns.\" Abathur is installed at the entrance of the World of Light beneath a heavenly curtain or bargod. This liminal location, as well as the specific motif of the heavenly curtain or veil, appear in both Jewish and Gnostic depictions of the angelic vice regent. Mandaean awareness of Jewish angelogical traditions in general and of Metatron in particular is supported by the evidence of the magic bowls.59 Indeed, Steven Wasserstrom has written that \"Metatron remained alive in Mandean magic for perhaps over a millenium.\"60 The most powerful evidence for Mandaean knowledge of Metatron appears in a magic bowl written in Mandaic which depicts Metatron -like Abathur -as serving before the heavenly curtain (bargod): \"in the name of Metatron HLDH who serves before the Curtain [bargod] and who has compassion upon the town and who has compassion upon the countryside. \"61 This bowl was apparently written by aJewish scribe for a Mandaean customer, which not only 57 Ibid., p. 210. 58 See, for example, The Canomtal Prayerbook, pp. 7, 45, 46; Guu;a, p. 196. 59 Jonas Greenfield, \"Notes on Some Aramaic and Mandaic Mag~c Bowls,\" Journal qfthe Ancunt Near Eastern Sonety qf Columbw Unwerstty 5, 1973, pp. 149-156. 60 Steven Wasserstrom, Between Muslzm and Jew: The Problem qf Symbwm Under Earfy Islam, Princeton, 1995, p. 191, n. 98. 61 The incantation bowl I refer to is Bowl D (931.4.2) in W.

Indeed, Metatron is not the only angelic being shared by Mandaeans and Jews. Gabriel was also adopted by Mandaeans and played an important role as a demiurgic figure in one version of the Mandaean cosmogony. In the Diwan Abatur, Abathur is described as follows: \"And Abatur putteth on its robes, (he) whose name is Kanfiel, he whose name is Bhaq, he whose name is Hazazban, he whose name is Nsab, his name is Tauriel.\"62 In a Genizah fragment, a figure named Kanfiel is one of the angels who greets Moses during his heavenly ascent and one of the princes created by the Holy One blessed be He, even before the creation of the world, when \"I [God] stretched the fire outside of mysel£ \"63 The many parallels between Abathur and Metatron are particularly striking when Mandaean writings (I. & III.) are placed side by side with passages from 3 Enoch (II.

From this liminal position, they possess complete vision and knowledge of the lower world's events and inhabitants, and, at the same time, they can receive instructions from on high. Both figures guard the gates of God's dwelling and decide who will be allowed to enter. In this respect they function like a psychopompos or \"leader of souls\" into the divine realm, as the following passages reveal: I. And Abathur, when he seeth thee, will take thy hand in holy troth, [kushta] Will clothe thee in his radiance and cover thee with his light. And he will set thee in his scales.

This function of the angelic vice regent is inherited from Jewish apocalyptic traditions of the chief angel (frequendy Michael), who leads the human visionary through a tour of heaven. The transformation which the human soul undergoes in the Mandaean passage resembles the transformation which Enoch undergoes in 3 Enoch 12, where he is wrapped in a \"glorious cloak in which brightness, brilliance, splendor, and luster of every kind were fixed,\" and crowned with a \"kingly crown\". Indeed, both elements (the glorious garments and crown) probably reflect the influence of Jewish apocalyptic sources, such as The Ascension if Isaiah, on Hekhalot and Mandaean literature, alike.71 71 Abathur is also depicted as wearing garments of light, cf., for example, A Pair qf Nasoraean Commentanes, p. 35, and The Canomcal Prayer Book, p. 45, \"(Like them) she (the soul) puts on garment on garment and robe over robe like the vestments of Abathur.\" Other Mandaean divine figures are also described as wearing gannents of light, see, Ode berg, 3 Enoch, p. 66. The transformation of Enoch also parallels the transformation which the Mandaean demiurge Ptahil undergoes at the hands of this father Abathur, c£ Gm;:;a, 348ff., \"When I, Ptahil, was created and came into being, I came into being from the source of the Great radiance. When my father considered and called me forth, he called me forth from the source of radiance. He clothed me in a garment of radiance and wrapped me in a covering of light. He gave me a great crown by whose radiance the worlds shine.\" It is more likely that Mandaean, as well as Hekhalot, depictions of the garments which wrap the ascend-ing soul derive from Jewish apoclayptic rather than Iranian sources, as Geo Widengren has argued in The Great Vohu Manak, Uppsala, 1945.

On p. 187, Meeks discusses the con-nection between the \"glorious garments\" found in baptism contexts, and the lost image of God which is construed as a \"robe of light\". Furthermore, in different Jewish and Samaritan contexts (including depictions of the revelation at Sinai) human beings (Moses, in particular) were re-clothed with the image of God which Adam lost in the Garden of Eden. A version of this tradition is also present in"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"ABATHUR'S I.AME.NT 99 Both Metatron and Abathur are associated with the care of human souls in other ways. Metatron is characterized as the teacher of \"all the souls of the dead that have died in their mothers' wombs, and of the babies that have died at their mothers' breasts, and of the schoolchildren that have died while studying the five books of the Torah.\"72 Abathur's watchouse is depicted as the storage place for the pre-existent souls that have not yet descended to earth. 73 Once again we observe the logic of the angelic vice regent: he is a guardian of the gate; a lord of mediation. Therefore, Metatron and Abathur are in charge of souls that are betwixt and between different modes of existence. In one case, the souls belong to those individuals who were never born or who died too young to receive a proper education; in the other case, the souls are waiting for their corresponding bodies to be born. Hypostatic Traditions A final parallel between Abathur and Metatron is that both figures function as hypostatic manifestations of the Divine Anthropos.74 As we will see shortly, most of the relevant passages link Abathur with specific body parts, as Metatron is linked with the face in early Jewish sources and with the phallus in medieval kabbalistic sources. One Mandaean passage does link the body ( 'stuna) with the image of the scales, a symbol of Abathur: \"For the body is ~ike) a (pair ofj balances!\"75 At least one Mandaean text identifies Abathur with the hypostatic body itself, just as Metatron was linked with the Shiur Q,omah. The passage appears in 7he Scroll rf Exalted Kingship. Its interpretation of the letters of the alphabet recalls similar descriptions in 7he Thousand and Twelve Qyestions, another priestly Mandaean sources, as Meeks notes, \"Robing with 'garments of light' restores the heavenly self in the Mandaean masbuta and masiqta rituals.\" In other words, the wearing of the glorious garments signifies the restoration to the original, divine self. 72 3 Enoch 48C. \"See Ginza, pp. 207-210. \" Another formulation of the hypostatic traditions associated with Abathur and their connections to the Kabbalah appears in The Gnostic Imagmation, pp. 124-127.

In this passage, the Wellspring, a female being, generates other beings who are each identified with a letter of the Mandaean alphabet. The sequence proceeds from \"A\" to \"T,\" and comprises the first eight letters of the Mandaean alphabet (there is no distinction phonemically between an original \"het\" and a \"heh,\" so the text does not include a \"het\" in the eighth position).76 Following this, the text cites another tradition in which the spirit, body, and soul are each linked with a different letter. Although in the first tradition, Abathur is identified with the letter \"U\" (a \"waw\") in the second, he is identified with the '\"ayn,\" which, as the text declares, \"belongs to the body, it is Abatur.\" Yusamin the Pure, Yawar the Great, Abatur the Lofty, Sam Mana Smira, and Sam Ziwa proceeded from her [the Wellspring]. They are the brothers of the Lord of Greatness and they are the letters of the alphabet. A is the Lord of Greatness; B is Mana the Great, Mighty one; G is the Great Father of Glory D is Yusamin the Pure; His Yawar the Great; U is Abatur the Lofty; Z is Sam Mana Smira; T is Singlan the Great .....

Anyone who reveals a portion of these mysteries, the well Sumqaq shall be his dwelling and he shall not see his creator! And Life is victorious!\" This esoteric tradition is extremely important for a number of reasons. First it is the only Mandaean text I know of which explicitly links Abathur with the body, itself, rather than a particular organ. Second this passage recalls the letter speculation of a number of Jewish mystical texts including the Sifi:r Yetsira and Sifer Ha-Bahir. Several scholars, including Drower and Dan Cohn-Sherbok, have already noted parallels between certain Mandaean doctrines and the Sifi:r Yetsira.78 None of them have comparatively examined the Mandaean and Jewish texts in depth, however. Unfortunately, such a detailed comparison also lies beyond the scope of the present study, since it would involve a prolonged detour into the complicated 76 On Mandaic orthography and this point in particular, see Edwin Yamauchi, Mandaic Incantation Texts, New Haven, 1967, p. 70. 77 The Scroll qf Exalted Kingship, p. 59. 78 See The Secret Adam, p. 17.

Given the present study's concentration on earlier Jewish sources, I will limit myself to a few observations concerning the relationship of the The Scroll qf Exalted Kingship to what is generally considered to be the first Kabbalistic text, the Bahir, a Provent;al work from the 12th century. Throughout his writings, Scholem depicted the Sqer ha-Bahir as a conduit for Gnostic influences in the Kabbalah.80 Although Scholem consistently cited the Bahir as evidence for the historical impact of ancient Gnosticism on the Kabbalah, he also considered the possibility that the parallels between the Bahir and Gnostic sources were fundamentally phenomenological rather than historical: The fundamental problem in the study of the book [i.e. the Bahir] is: is the affinity based on an as yet unknown historical link between the gnosticism of the rnishnaic and talmudic era and the sources from which the material in Sefer ha-Bahir is derived? Or should it possibly be seen as a purely psychological phenomenon, i.e., as a spontaneous upsurge from the depths of the soul's imagination, without any historical continuity?81 In Origins qf the Kabbalah, Scholem seemed to waver between historical and phenomenological explanations for the parallels between Gnosticism and the Kabbalah. On the one hand, Scholem wrote \"it is not too much to assume that the gnostic material of Oriental origin in the Book Bahir, once it was received and adopted by a circle of religiously agitated and productive men, amply suffices to explain the inner development of the Kabbalah up to and including, the -?phar.\"82 On the other hand, Scholem suggested that \"The process within the pleroma that brought forth the aeons or the sefiroth could have been developed anew, using purely Jewish forms 79 Werblowsky, op. cit., 132. 80 See, for example, Major Trewls, 34, 75; \"Kabbalah,\" Enc. ]ud., 506, 519; Kabbalah, Jerusalem, 1974, 315; Origms qfthe Kabbalah, 58, 68, 90, 99, 197; On the Kabbalah and its Symbolism, New York, 1969, 99. 81 Kabbalah, 315. \" Origms qf the Kabbalah, 90."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"102 CHAPTER FIVE and based on purely Jewish material, as soon as the preliminary historical and psychological conditions were present. \"83 Scholem's interest in the possible links between the Bahir and Gnosticism focused on Western Gnostic traditions, such as the school of Valentinus. In the next few paragraphs, I will focus on parallels between the Bahir and Mandaeism. Like Scholem, I am open to the possibility that the similarities between Mandaean sources and the Kabbalah are the result of historical contact or, conversely, that they reflect parallel, independent developments. If the esoteric traditions are linked historically, the contact must have occured in Babylonia, where Jews and Mandaeans appear to have shared angelogical and magical traditions. At some point, a Jewish doctrine which emerged from this syncretistic mileu may have made its way via Jewish travellers to Western Europe, a scenario akin to the one depicted in the Chronicle if Ahimaz, a medieval document which describes a figure named Aaron of Baghdad (Abu Aaron) as traveling from Babylonia to southern Italy, eventually transmitting his secrets to Moses b. Kalonymus, a founder of the German Pietists (Haside Ashkenaz). Whether or not such a historical link existed between Mandaean and Jewish traditions, and it seems extremely unlikely that it could ever be proved, the parallels between the sources are thought provoking. Both the Bahir and 17ze Scroll if Exalted Kingshzp depict emanatory systems in which the primordial source of creation is a tree and a wellspring. As the Mandaean text declares: \"those twenty-four letters of the alphabet are the twenty-four crowns that clothe the twenty-four kings who are formed by the light. For the light, the Wellspring, and the Datepalm wear the radiance that glows in the light of Tibil [\"earth\"], and the twenty-four stars, the body, and the twenty four mysteries (that) do not sleep\".84 According to another Mandaean text, from the hieros gamos between the phallic datepalm and vaginal wellspring (Aina u-sindirka), \"proceed all worlds and generations.\"85 The Diwan Abatur contains a drawing of a tree known as 'lana d mrabia yanqia (\"the tree which nourishes nurslings\"), which, as Drower notes, \"is said to be identical with the Sindarka\" mentioned above.86 83 Ibid., 99. 84 The Scroll qf Exalted Kingship, p. 41. 85 The Thousand and Twel:oe Qy£stwns, p. 110.

And in it I established All and I called it All ..... For all depends on it, and all proceed from it, and all need it, and all gaze on it, and all wait for it, and from it fly all the souls ..... To what is this similar? To a king who wanted to plant a tree in his garden ..... He dug and opened a spring [ma)tryan], flowing with living waters [mtryim hqyim]. He then planted the tree, and it stood, giving forth fruit. It was successfully rooted, since it was always watered from the spring.\"87 This passage has much in common with the Mandaean symbology of tree and wellspring, including the reference to the \"living waters\" (mayim htryim) a concept which appears throughout Mandaean sources where the waters are called by the analagous expression mia hiia. The Bahir has a complex cosmological and mythological system of light, flowing water, letters of the alphabet, crowns, parts of the body, sexual symbols, and divine attributes. These same elements appear in The Scroll qf Exalted Kingship, where they interact in ways recalling their relationship in the Bahir. Fully illuminating these parallels would require a detailed semiotic analysis, a worthwhile project, but one taking us too far afield from our original subject. To give some indication of the similarity between Mandaean and kabbalistic thought, however, I quote another passage from The Scroll qf Exalted Kingship: As to the novice [priest], you know that there is something female about him -the inner crown that comes to the outer one supports it. Behold, the crown of the bridegroom has something internal to it, (something) dwelling in the mystery of the female! (IQ there is nothing external within it, its kingship is lost. Behold, the female without the male cannot be established!88 Typically, the crown or taga is a male, priesdy symbol in Mandaeism and yet this passage emphasizes its androgynous character, an androgyny in which the female supports and is literally comprised within the male. This model of androgyny and its use of crown and marital symbolism gready resembles one of the most important symbolic structures of the Kabbalah, one which Elliot Wolfson has explicated as follows: \"The image of the masculine king wearing the crown connotes perfect unity of male and female, which, as I have 87 Sifer ha-Bahzr, sees. 15-16. 88 The Thousand and Twewe Questwns, p. 41."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"104 CHAPTER FIVE noted above, involves a reconstitution of the male androgyne ..... the image of the crown or the process of crowning is used to denote the union of the masculine and femine aspects of the pleroma.\"89 Within the Bahir, the idea of androgyny is linked to the date palm which is described as \"including both male and female. How is this? The lulav [the frond of the date palm] is male and the fruit is male on the outside and female on the inside.\"90 Thus, the Bahir, like the Mandaean text, links the masculine with the external and the feminine with the internal. I close my discussion of The Scroll qf Exalted Kingship and its parallels with kabbalistic sources by returning to the passage which prompted this excursus. The section on the beings of light and their connection to the letters of the alphabet is introduced by the following line: \"These are the seven kings who proceeded from one Wellspring [aina] and five others who proceeded from other Wellsprings ..... A is the Lord of Greatness; B is Mana the Great ..... \" This passage has a close parallel in the Bahir. \"These are the explicit holy exalted names. There are twelve names, one for each of the twelve tribes of Israel... .. To what is this similar? A king had a beautiful wellspring [ma'qyan]. All his brothers had no water except from this wellspring and could not endure thirst. What did he do to this wellspring? He made twelve pipes for the fountain and gave them twelve names.\"91 This parable is followed by a discussion of the letters of the alphabet. Both sources speak of twelve divine figures fed by primordial wellsprings; both link this theogonic model with the alphabet. Whether or not the kabbalistic and Mandaean authors drank from the same well of traditions, these parallels suggest the development of similar symbolic and mythological systems and shed new light on the possible relationship of the Bahir to Gnostic sources. Despite their similarities, the Bahir and Mandaean sources also reflect the profound differences between Judaism and Mandaeism. The Bahir makes liberal use of biblical citations and emphasizes the importance of the commandments (mit::;vot). Unlike Mandaeism, which valorizes the North as \"the source of light, instruction, and healing,\" (the North Star, for example, is the seat of Abathur)92, the \"Wolfson, Through a Speculum that Shines, pp. 363-364. 90 Sifer ha-Bahir, sec. 59. \" Ibid., sec. 47. 92 On the significance of the North in Mandaeism, see The Mo.ruloeons I!{ lmtj and Iran, p. 18, n. 9; p. 199 on Abathur and the north star."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"ABATHUR'S LAMENT 105 Bahir, drawing on an older Jewish tradition, considers the North to be the source of evil. The Bahir also valorizes circumcision, while Mandaeans abhor the practice and a circumcized man cannot serve as a priest. Although they have greatly differing attitudes towards circumCisiOn, both Mandaeism and the Kabbalah view the phallus as a locus of esoteric knowledge or gnosis. The following passage from the Mandaean work known as The Lesser First World indicates this clearly. It describes the phallus as \"more venerated than all the mysteries\" and identifies Abathur as the hypostatic phallus of the Cosmic Body: And when thou recitest 'Life dwelleth in Its own radiance', thou offerest praise to Maleness (the male organ?), the name of which is Abatur of the scales but which the worlds and generations call duna [Lit. \"keg\"; Fig. \"penis\"], for it is more venerated than all the mysteries, and worlds and generations are held (comprised) therein.93 The same text identifies Abathur as the hypostatic tongue, as well: \"the lofty Abathur whose name is 'the Tongue.' [lishana}\"94 A parallel depiction is found in The Thousand and Twelve Qyestions, \"Abathur-Rama, whose name is 'the GreatJordan of White Water', that he is called 'the Tongue'.\"95 Elsewhere, the Jordan is explicitly identified as semen: \"she [the soul] received a sign from the Jordan -which is Semen -and entered the Scales.\"96 Thus, Abathur is identified as thesemen as well as the phallus, itsel£ At first, the identification of Abathur as the hypostatic tongue may seem both obscure and unrelated to his function as the divine phallus. The reason for this identification is illuminated, however, when we observe that in the Jewish mystical and cosmological text, Sqer 'Yesira, the \"circumcision of the tongue and the mouth\" is identified with the \"circumcision of the foreskin.''97 Moreover, as Y ehuda Liebes has observed, the :Z,ohar considers the stifirah called Da'at to be a symbol of the tongue, \"which is considered 93 A Pmr qf Nasoraean Commentanes, p. 57.

The identification of Abathur as both the hypostatic phallus and tongue reflects two aspects of his character. Abathur is the father of the demiurge, Ptahil, and may have been understood to be the \"father of the uthras\" (aba d-'utria).99 The characterization of Abathur as the father of a host of angelic beings would have easily translated into, or reinforced, an identification of Abathur as the phallus, i. e. the organ of fatherhood, and as semen. Both Brandt and Noldeke saw this title as a possible etymology for the name Abathur. Macuch has pointed out that despite the similarity between phrases such as aba d-'utria hatiqa rama kasia ntira (\"the ancient, lofty, concealed, guarded father of the uthras\") and abatur hatiqa rama kasia untira (\"Abathur the ancient, lofty, concealed and guarded\"), the title \"father of the uthras\" does not appear to have been applied to Abathur in Mandaean literature, although it is linked with the figure B'haq-Ziwa (as we saw above), who is identified with Abathur.100 Just as importantly, Abathur was identified with the balance or scale in his avatar as Abathur d-muzania or \"Abathur of the Scales.\" Elliot Wolfson has demonstrated that Jewish mystics established linguistic and iconographic connections between the scale and the phallus.101 For example, the medieval work Sifer ha-'ljyun makes a pun on the Hebrew word peles or \"scale,\" whose consonants can also signify the Latin word \"phallus.\"102 Wolfson observes that in a Vision, and Textual Intetpretation: From Midrashic Trope to Mystical Symbol,\" H!Stary qf Relzgwns 27, 1987, p 207 and Yehuda Lebes, Studies in the Zohar, Albany, 1993, p. 171, n. 65, note this connection. It should be mentioned that the Mandaeans do not practice circumcision, nor do they spiritualize circumcision as, for example, in the Gnostic Gospel qf17wmas 90:18-23, cf. E. Yamauchi, Gnostic Ethics and Mandaean Ongins, p. 64; E.S. Drower, Dzwan Abatur, p. 17. 98 Studzes in the Zohar, p. 171, n. 65, where Lebes refers to Da'at as \"the inner essence of Yesod.

Finally, according to yet another passage, Abathur is the liver: \"Abatur-Rama, he is the liver [abatur rama kabda hu]\".104 Underlying the identification between Abathur and the liver may be a pun on the Mandaic word kabda, which generally means liver but, in this case, may also have the connotation of Glory, as in Hebrew. 105 Similar puns are quite common in Mandaean literture, as ]. ]. Buckley points out: \"Mandaean texts abound in obviously enjoyed puns and word-plays\". 106 A link between the Glory and the divine phallus also appears in the Zohar, as Liebes writes: \"In the Zohar both the male organ and the sifira of resod are called the glory of the body, hiddura de-gufa (II, 186b).\"107 Abathur of the Scales As the lord or embodiment of the scales, Abathur mediates between opposing elements. It is not surprising that Abathur's realm is described as follows: \"There is death, there is life. There is darkness, there is light. There is error, there is truth. There is destruction, there is construction. There is blow, there is healing.\"108 Until now, scholars have emphasized the Iranian background of Abathur's function as weigher of souls, by linking Abathur with the Iranian figure of Rashnu razishta. 109 As Kurt Rudolph writes: \"Das an den Seelenaufstieg anschlieBende Seelengericht durch den 'Waagemann' Abathur hat sein Vorbild in dem Rashnu razishta\".\"0 Although 103 Ibid., p. 64, and p. 182, n. 128 for kabbalistic sources of this image. 104 A Pair qf Nasoraean Comnuntaries, p. 8. 105 Drower has suggested this very pun in a different context, see, A Pmr qf Nasoraean Commmtanes, p. 57, n. 3. 106 Buckley, The Scroll qf Exalted Kingship, p. 82. 107 Studws m the Zohar, p. 2 7. 108 Ginza, 206.

The motif of weighing an individual or his deeds in a scale (\"psychostasy\") appears frequently in biblical and rabbinic sources.112 In apocalyptic literature, the theme of weighing merits emerges in a number of texts, where it is sometimes associated with a secondary divine being instead of with God, as in the biblical and rabbinic sources. 113 The specific motif of an angelic being who weighs souls, rather than deeds or merits, appears in the Testament qf Abraham, Recension A, ch. 12, a text we examined above. In this text, the biblical figure Abel is depicted as the enthroned judge, while another \"sunlike angel\" (Dokiel) actually weighs the souls in a balance: ''' Ginza, p. 284. 112 The Bible contains several examples of weighing the individual in the scale, including Job 31:6, Prov. 16:11, Ps 62:10, and Daniel 5:27. Job 31:6 reads, \"Let Him weigh me on the scale of righteousness\"; Prov. 16: 11, \"Scales and balances of justice belong to the Lord\"; Ps. 62:10, \"Humans are breath; people are illusion; weighed on a scale together they are less than breath\"; Daniel5:27, \"You have been weighed in the balance and found wanting.\" In rabbinic literature the emphasis is on weighing the merits of an individual, although the image of weighing the indi-vidual is also present. Two of the most striking rabbinic examples of this motif are Pirkei Avot 2:8, where Abba Saul declares: \"If all the sages of Israel were in one scale of a balance, and even Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus were with them, and Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh in the other scale, he would outweigh them all.\" and Pesiqta de Rav Kahana xxvi (ed. Buber, 167a), where R. Eliezer declares: \"The scales are even-ly balanced. The scales of iniquities on the one side and of merits on the other; the Holy One inclines (the balance) to the scale of merit.\" For a discussion of the theme of weighing meri s in a balance in rabbinic literature, cf. E. P. Sanders, Paul and Palestinian Judaism, London and Philadelphia, 1977, pp. 128-147. 113 In apocalyptic writings, the motif of a divine being who weighs merits with a scale appears in several places including IV Ezra 3:34 and I Enoch 41:1; 61:8. In IV Ezra 3:34, we read, \"Now, therefore, weigh thou our iniquities, and those of the inhabitants of the world, in the balance rfiendara in statera nostras imquitates] and so shall be found which way the tum of the scale inclines [momentum puncti ubi decline!].\" In I Enoch 41: I, after Enoch sees the four Archangels, he \"saw all the secrets of the heavens, and how the kingdom is divided, and how the actions of men are weighed in the balance.\" And in I Enoch 61:8, \"the Lord of Spirits placed the Elect One on the throne of glory. And he shall judge all the works of the holy above in the heav-en, and in the balance shall their deeds be weighed.\" The importance of the last passage is that the function of weighing merits has been transferred from God to a lower divine being, placed by God on a throne of glory and appointed weigher and judge."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"ABATHUR'S LAMENT 109 And between the two gates there stood a terrifYing throne with the appearance of terrifYing crystal, flashing like fire. And upon it sat a wondrous man, bright as the sun, like unto a son of God. Before him stood a table like crystal, all of gold and byssus ..... In front of the table sat a light-bearing angel, holding a balance in his hand ..... And the one who was in the front of the table, who was holding the balance, weighed the souls.'\" The parallels between this passage and Mandaean depictions of Abathur are significant and, furthermore, are not limited to the motifs of the angelic beings who judge and weigh human souls, rather than deeds or merits. Another important parallel is the presence of a crystal structure at the heavenly location of the weighing. In the passage cited above, both a throne and a table of crystal are associated with the weighing and judging of souls. The Mandaean text Diwan Abatur also juxtaposes the motifs of a crystal structure and the psychostasy: This is Abatur who is in charge of the weighing and numbering [of souls]. This is the throne Sar (\"It-stood-firm\"). This is the vault; its name is \"Covering-over\"; its name is \"Pure Crystal\" [bilura dakia]; It is crystal cut into facets [qisa]. It abideth and my soul counteth thereon.115 Although the Mandaean passage depicts the heavenly vault, rather than a throne or table, as composed of crystal, the image of a heavenly crystal structure is almost certainly derived from the same Jewish apocalyptic milieu. Indeed, another Mandaean text actually depicts the construction of a sanctuary of crystal and a table (or tray) of crystal by primordial priests: \"Thereupon they set to work and built a sanctuary (bimanda) all of pure crystal... .. and set up a table (tariana) that was of pure crystal.\"'16 In many apocalyptic texts, the earthly or heavenly Temple in Jerusalem is described as composed of crystal or \"pure marble\". 117 114 Test. qf Abr. 12, as cited in The Old Testament Pseurkpigrapha, vol. 1, p. 889; see also the comments in n. f. 115 Diwan Abatur, p. 7. 116 A Pair qf Nasoraean Commentaries, pp. 10-11.

And behold there was an opening before me (and) a second house which is greater than the former..... And I observed and saw inside it a lofty throne -its appearance was like crystal. . . And the Great Glory was sitting upon it ...... 118 In this early passage, we find traces of the later Mandaean motif of a heavenly crystal vault (in this case the \"floor\" of the heavenly house) and the later apocalyptic motif of the throne of crystal (as in Test. rf Abr.) associated with the image of an enthroned judge. Ultimately, the image of a heavenly structure composed of crystal probably derives from biblical verses like Ex. 24:10, where \"under His [God's] feet there was the likeness of a pavement of sapphire, like the very sky for purity\" and Ezek. 1:22, \"Above the heads of the creatures was a form: an expanse, with an awe-inspiring gleam as of crystal, was spread out above their heads.\"119 By illuminating the many parallels between Mandaean and Jewish depictions of an enthroned being who weighs and/ or judges human souls, I am not arguing that the older Jewish sources necessarily influenced the development of the later Mandaean tradition. I am suggesting, however, that the previous emphasis on an Iranian Vorbild for the figure of Abathur must be re-evaluated in light of the well attested and earlier Jewish traditions discussed above. Before leaving the issue of the angelic weigher of souls or merits, it is important to note that this motif also appears in 3 Enoch 18, Johann Maier, \"Das Gefahrdungsmotiv bei der Himmelsreise in der jiidischen Apokalyptik und 'Gnosis',\" Kairos 5, 1963, discuss the parallel between the appearance of the earthly and heavenly Temples. Both also link the tradition of the celestial Temple composed of \"pure marble\" with R. Akiba's warning in BT Hag. 14b (and Hekhalot parallels, §§259, 345, 408-410, 672), \"When you arrive at the stones of pure marble, do not say 'Water, Water',\" On this connection also cf. David Halperin, Faces qf the Chariot, pp. 21 Off. I. Gruenwald discusses the motif of heavenly structures composed of crystal or sapphire in Apocafyptic arui Merkavah Mysticism, p. 35, n. 21. Finally, mention should be made of the \"Temple of the Grail\" built by King Titurel, which was composed of crystal plated tiles, cf Henri Corbin, T ernple arui ConternpW.tion, London, 1986, p. 360. 118 As cited in The Old Testament Pseuclepigrapha, Vol. 1, pp. 20-21. 119 Also see Ezek. 1:26, \"Above the expanse over their heads was the semblance of a throne, in appearance like sapphire\". Although the color of sapphire is blue, in a text noted by Gruenwald, see n. 119 above, the sapphire of Ex. 24:10 is described as white (Lekah Tov, ad Exodus 24:10)."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"ABATHUR'S LAMENT 111 where among the angelic inhabitants of the seventh hekhal whom Metatron describes to R.

The origin of hqjiqia mia has long been traced to Persian sources.126 Wilhelm Brandt hypothesized that the Mandaean waters were modeled on the Persian \"stream of tears\" which the soul must cross over after death. 127 In a Pahlavi text called Sad Dar, we find the stream of tears described as follows: The ninety-sixth subject is this, when any one departs to that other world it is not proper for others that they should utter an outcry, maintain grief, and make lamentation and weeping. Because every tear that issues from the eyes becomes one drop of that river before the Kinvad bridge, and then the soul of that dead person remains at that place; it is difficullt for it to make a passage there, and it is not able to pass over the Kinvad bridge.128 As support for the parallel between hqjiqia mia and the \"stream of tears,\" Brandt expanded his comparison to include the \"Kinvad bridge\" which linked the physical world with the after life in Persian religion. Based on several passages in the Gin::;a Raba and Mandaean Book if John, 129 Brandt argued for the existence of an analagous fixed bridge in the Mandaean sources, which traversed hqjiqia mia.130 However, as Svend Pallis has pointed out, instead of referring to a fixed bridge such as the Kinvad, Mandaean sources valorize the ritual of baptism131 as a symbolic bridge to the Pleroma, an observation which leads Pallis to argue \"against the existence of a fixed bridge like the Kinvad, which everybody must cross. \"132 Pallis continues his critique of Brandt's position by rejecting the parallel 120 Wilhelm Brandt, Das Schicksal der Seele nach dem Tode nach mandaischen und par-sicken Vorstellungen, Jahrbucher for protestantische Theologie, XVIII, Braunschweig, 1892, pp. 405-38, 575-603. 121 Ibid., pp. 427-429. 128 Sad Dar, Sec. 96:1-2, as cited in Pallis, Mandaean Studies, p. 75.

Foremost among them is the linguistic analogy between the Mandaic hojiqia mia and the Hebrew expressions ojiqe mayim and ojiqe yam, whose relevant biblical appearances occur in Psalms 18 and II Samuel 22, respectively. In these parallel passages, the terms ojiqe yam and ojiqe mayim signify the cosmic waters which must be re-defeated by God in order to save the righteous individual, who is \"drawn up out of the mighty waters\" by God.

Jewish, Christian, and Gnostic sources all depict heavenly water. Some of these sources also emphasize that the ascending soul or individual will encounter this water during the heavenly journey. The image of heavenly water appears in Justin's Book qf Baruch (Hippolytus, Haer. 5.26 and 5:27.3) and the Nag Hammadi treatise Melchizedek (CG IX 8:1 ).139 The most detailed Gnostic description of heavenly water is in the treatise Zostrianos (CG VIII 18-5-9), which mentions the presence of water at the end of the ecstatic ascent: \"The great male invisible perfect Mind, the perfect Protophanes has his own water, as you [will see] when you arrive at his place.\" This text is also significant insofar as it links this water with a specific being, just as Mandaean sources link the cosmic waters with Abathur. The view that one encounters water in heaven was common in Jewish and Christian apocalyptic literature. For example, the Testament qf Levi 2:7 declares: \"And I entered from the first heaven and saw a huge sea hanging there\"; the Testament qf Abraham 8 states: \"And Michael went out and took Abraham in the body on a cloud and lifted him up to the river Ocean\"; while 2 Enoch 3:3 states: \"They placed me on the first heaven and showed me a very great sea, greater than the earthly sea.\"140 While these passages merely mention the existence of heavenly water, Rev. 22:1 likens the heavenly water to crystal: \"he showed me a river of living water as clear as crystal proceeding from the throne of God and of the Lamb,\" and Rev. 4:6 describes \"a sea of 138 Ibid., pp. 62-63. 139 G.

I :22, where the firmament between God and the hayyot is likened to crystal and Gen. 1:7, where the upper and lower waters in heaven are separated by a firmament. As Rowland writes: \"Indeed the link between the water and the firmament here [in Gen. I :7] could explain the resemblance of the sea in Rev. 4 to crystal, for the juxtaposition of water and the firmament in Gen. could easily have led to the comparison of the firmament to crystal found in Ez. 1, 22.\"142 The link between heavenly water and some kind of solid substance (crystal or glass) recalls a famous passage from the Babylonian Talmud known as Rabbi Akiba's \"Water Warning\". In the same section of the Talmud where Aher's disastrous encounter with Metatron appears we find the following warning: \"When you arrive at the stones of pure marble, do not say 'Water, Water' for it is said, 'The speaker of lies shall not be established before my eyes.\"' (Babylonian Talmud Hagigah 14b) In addition to the Babylonian Talmud, the water episode appears in several places in the Hekhalot literature, including Synopse §§259, 345, 408-410, and 672.143 Unlike the talmudic account, all but 1\" Actually, the \"sea of glass like unto crystal\" in Rev. 4:6 is not really water at all, but a \"crystal like\" substance. Rev. 15:2 also refers to a \"sea of glass\" but omits the reference to crystal. 142 \"The Visions of God in Apocalyptic Literature,\" p. 148. 143 The relationship between the talmudic and Hekhalot versions of the episode has been discussed by numerous scholars, including Gershom Scholem, who writes in Major Trends m ]ewtSh Mysttcism, p. 53, that \"Nothing could be more farfetched than to treat it [one of the Hekhalot versions] as a postfistum interpretation of the Talmudic passage.\"; Ephraim Urbach, \"Ha-Mesorot 'a!

Furthermore, on p. 210, Halperin declares that \"Precisely because text I [i.e. Synopse §259] gives no hmt that it is directly linked to BT Hag. 14b, we can use it with some confidence as an inde-pendent witness to the ideas underlying that source.

The encounter with the cosmic water is fraught with danger in both Mandaean and Hekhalot sources. The water functions as a final obstacle before the individual can enter the divine abode (the House of Life or seventh hekhal). The literary proximity of the water warning to the Aher/Metatron encounter suggests that the two passages may be read together and that the illusion of water is located near Metatron, just as the water is located above the throne of Abathur in Mandaean sources. Finally, the version in §409 links the heavenly water with a scene of weighing and judgement (')udge him to the scale of merit\"), precisely the cluster of motifs in the Mandaean texts, where Abathur weighs the soul to determine whether it is worthy to cross the waters and enter the world of light. There is, however, an extremely significant difference between the Merkabah and Mandaean traditions. According to the latter, the water at the end of the heavenly journey is real, whereas the former emphasize that the water is not real but an illusion. Indeed, the ability to recognize the illusory waters for what they really are, e. g. the \"stones of pure marble,\" is the only way to avoid being ignominiously dispatched by the angelic guardians. The water episode may be read as a warning against those who expect to see water at the end of a heavenly journey. Since the motif of heavenly water appears in Mandaean, Gnostic, and Jewish and Christian apocalyptic literature, the Talmudic and Hekhalot traditions may even have a polemical orientation. Unlike the adherents of these other traditions, who believe in the existence of heavenly water before the divine abode, the truly enlightened Merkabah mystic knows that what others think is water is actually stone (or the \"air of the splendor of the stones of pure marble\"). In their minds, this special knowledge elevates the adherents of Merkabah mysticism above those of other late antique ascent traditions. The possibility that the \"Water Warning\" may have functioned as a polemic against Mandaean cosmological beliefs gains support from two other details in the Hekhalot versions of the episode. None of the Hekhalot sources, except for §672, which parallels the Talmudic account, limit their description to the stones of pure marble. Instead, they describe the explicit cause of the illusion produced by the stones as either the \"air of splendor\" (awir ziw) or \"splendor of air\" (ziw awir) of the stones.

In a number of Mandaean accounts, a divine being called Radiance or ::;iwa leads the soul over the hajiqia mia to the World of Light: I. The soul flieth and goeth until she came to the waters of death [hqfiqia mia] there came forth towards her a great beam of radiance [ziwa] (and) of life, (who) grasped her by the palm of her right hand and brought her over the waters of death [hqfiqia mza].15<J II.

He graspeth her [the soul] with the palm of his right hand and handeth her over to two 'uthras, sons of light, to Adatan and Yadatan, of one gnosis and one mind.'51 Other Mandaean passages describe a substance called the tryar ::;iwa or \"air of splendor\" which surrounds the world and is personified as a divine being. As Drower writes: Ayar-Ziwa. \"Ether-Brilliance\" or \"radiant ether\" ..... With the Man-daeans this rare and purer atmosphere is represented as interpenetrating the thick air round the earth, and giving it vital qualities ..... This Ether is personified, and is sometimes mentioned as a source of life.152 The personification of the air or ether appears in numerous Mandaean texts including The Scroll rif Exalted Kingship, which describes part of the initiation ritual for the tarmida or low ranking Mandaean priest and refers frequendy to the hymns or 149 Faces qf the Chanot, p. 206. 150 Canonical PrayerBook, p. 63. 151 Ibid., pp. 45-46. 152 E.

One passage from this priestly text combines radiance, ether/air, and water in a way reminiscient of the Merkabah accounts: \"There is radiance, and there is radiance and light and there is Ether in them; it dwelt and was divided into flows of water and streams without end.\"153 This passage supports the general Mandaean view that water and light are intimately connected, as Drower writes: \"Water, which reflects the light, is considered a form of light. . . The conception that the firmament is filled with a fluid light and that water is a grosser form of it appears in the doctrine of the planetary boats.\"154 The Mandaean terms for air (ayar) and radiance (ziwa) parallel the expressions awir ziw and ziw awir which appear in the Hekhalot versions of the \"Water Warning.\" Indeed, both Hekahlot and Mandaean sources agree that connected with the cosmic waters (or illusion of waters) is some kind of light or radiance and air. Once again, however, there is a crucial difference between theJewish and Mandaean traditions. The Mandaeans personify the radiance and air, even transforming them into beings who help the soul over the waters. They also posit that the light actually becomes manifest in the form of water. By contrast, the Hekhalot authors connect the radiance and air to the stones which only appear like water. The Hekhalot texts therefore provide an alternate explanation for the appearance of the radiance and air (they are not divine beings) just as they suggest an alternate explanation for the appearance of the water. In both cases, the source of the illusion is actually the stones of the palace or hekhal. This etiology prioritizes the hekhalot over other cosmological structures which may appear in competing traditions such as Mandaeism. As in the case of the waters, rather than denying that radiance and air appear at the end of the heavenly journey, the Hekhalot authors offer their own definitive version of the tradition, thereby subtly undermining other cosmological traditions without explicitly rejecting them by name. The chief problem for the Jewish texts is that water, radiance, and air might be combined at the end of the heavenly ascent. This is precisely the combination which appears in Mandaean traditions. The Jewish sources argue that only an illusion of water exists and 153 The Scroll qf Exalted Kingshzp, p. 49. 154 The Mandmans qf Iraq and Iran, p. I 00.

For Haiasum Kusta is the soul that comes and settles on his head and surrounds herself with seven walls of the white waters.\"155 Here we find an explicit declaration concerning the waters which causes seven walls of iron to surround the individual in a protective fashion (in another text, Abathur is called \"hard iron that is strong\"). 156 In the Hekhalot text, by contrast, the declaration concerning water causes axes of iron to kill the individual. A final element of the Hekhalot versions of the \"Water Warning\" which may suggest a polemical context is the condemnation: \"He is from the seed of those who kissed the calf,\" applied to the individual who mistakes the stones for water. According to a number of rabbinic sources, the golden calf was either created by the \"mixed multitude\" which left Egypt with the Israelites, as cited in Ex. 12:38 and Numbers 11 :4,157 or by Egyptian magicians. 158 Thus in Song Raba 1:9, Rabbi Judan quotes in the name of Rabbi Aha: \"The Egyptian magicians performed sorceries, and it [the calf] appeared to leap before them [the Israelites].\" Although the condemnation may refer to heretics in general, the formulation may also hint at a more specific focus.

Whether or not they existed in the pre or early Islamic period is open to conjecture. The Jewish tradition portraying the Egyptians or mixed multitude as the makers of the golden calf combined with the Mandaean identification with the Egyptians, denigration of the revelation at Sinai, and general hostility to Judaism may have inspired a Jewish polemic which identified the Mandaeans as the mixed multitude who left Egypt with the Israelites and therefore as the makers of the golden calf. Unfortunately, we do not know enough about the forms of Jewish polemics in Late Antiquity nor do we know to which groups the various \"minim\" (the most common rabbinic term for heretics) belonged. It is possible that among the heretics condemned in rabbinic literature were the Mandaeans and that the \"Water Warning,\" is directed against those Jews who were attracted to Mandaean cosmological beliefs. The motif of heavenly water appears in Jewish apocalyptic sources but its adoption by Christian apocalyptic circles, Gnosticism, and Mandaeism may have encouraged the authors of the Merkabah texts to reject it. Were it known to the authors of the Talmud or the Hekhalot passages, the Mandaean formulation of the heavenly waters would have been particularly disturbing because of its many close parallels with the Merkabah tradition. As the \"proximate Other\" in terms of cosmological motifs, language (Mandaic and the Aramaic of the Babylonian Talmud are very similar), and geographical location (Mandaeans and Jews lived in close proximity in Babylonia) the Mandaeans would have posed a particular challenge to any Babylonian Jews involved in Merkabah mysticism. 160 The Mandaeans qf Iraq and Iran, p. 10. 161 Gnoru: A &lectzon qf Texts, p 296, n. 1."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"ABATHUR'S LAMENT 123 Mandaeans themselves were hardly shy in their attacks on Judaism.

Thus, The Scroll qf Exalted Kingshzp depicts Judaism as the stage prior to Mandaeism, which must be cast off by the individual: \"The first, outer casting off (is) when he leaves from the isolation (or: 'ban') oftheJews to be clothed with mandaeism [here understood as Mandaean lay status and therefore Buckley puts it in lower case].

The \"Water Warning,\" may thus be understood as a very sophisticated polemic against a heretical belief in heavenly water, perhaps specifically focusing on Mandaean beliefs. Instead of denying the existence of such water outright, the Jewish sources acknowledge that something which looks like water does exist at the end of the heavenly journey but only those \"from the seed of those who kissed the calf' (i.e. heretics) mistakenly take the illusion to be reality.

In this chapter, I will focus on his role in the Gnostic documents known as the Hypostasis qf the Archons (HypArch)1 and On the Origin qf the World (OnOrgWld).2 It seems probable that HypArch, like its neighbors in the Nag Hammadi library, was originally written in Greek and then translated into Coptic.3 Although widely discussed, the provenance and date of the document are still debated. Nevertheless, the date of the traditions must be prior to the fourth century date of the codex. A great deal of scholarship has been produced on HypArch, in the form of critical editions, general studies, and highly specialized articles. Like HypArch, OnOrgWld was probably composed in Greek and translated into Coptic. Its date and provenance are similarly unfixed, 1 CG II,4. Also called 7he Nature of the Archons.

R.A. Bullard, 7he Hypostasis of the Archons (Patristische Texte und Studien 10), Berlin, 1970, p. 115, argues for an Ophite origin for the first part of the text, and a heavy Valentinian influence on the second part; in his \"Introduction,\" to Nag Hammadi Codex II, 2-7, Vol. I, p. 224, however, Bullard sug-gests that any identification of the text with a specific Gnostic sect \"must be accom-panied by a healthy skepticism about the usefulness of these sectarian names as employed by the orthodox heresiologists.\" This view is shared by Fallon, 7he Enthronement of Sabaoth, p. 5."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"SABAOTH'S REHABILITATION 125 though not for lack of speculation. 4 While not as extensively studied as its literary cousin, OnOrgWld has nevertheless inspired a variety of scholary works. Two of the most pressing questions concerning these documents is their relationship to one another, and their relationship to Christianity and Judaism, respectively. It is now generally accepted that a direct literary relationship between HypArch and OnOrgWld should be rejected. Instead, the two documents appear to have reworked a common set of earlier traditions. By contrast, the relationship of the two texts to Christianity and Judaism remains highly contested. According to Bentley Layton, HypArch is an \"apocalyptic Christian vaticinium ex eventu, a Christian gnostic rewriting of Genesis and the Prophets.\"5 Elaine Pagels emphasizes the influence of Paul's writings on HypArch, suggesting that the text \"mythically elaborates Paul's own exegesis\" .6 Bullard argues that the audience was a Christian Gnostic community which accepted the authority of Paul and had a wide ranging knowledge of both Old and New Testament material. 7 The view that the Christian elements are an integral part of HypArch is not universally accepted. Most recently, Bernard Bare has suggested that the text's explicitly Christian features reflect the attempt of a hypothetical redactor to Christianize originally non-• A. Bohlig and P.

Fallon, The Enthronement qf Sabaoth, p. 6 has refrained from assigning the text to a particular Gnostic sect until the sects, themselves, are better defined, although Fallon does argue for Valentianian influ-ence on the text, pp. 104-116, noting, however, on p. 116, that the author \"has not been bound by Valentinianism but developed further beyond it.\" 5 \"The Hypostasis of the Archons,\" p. 364. Layton also writes, \"the story might be considered to be non-Christian. But of course such a view would be wrong.\" 'E. Pagels, \"Genesis Creation Acccounts from Nag Hammadi,\" in Nag Hammadi, Gnosticism, and Earfy Christianity, p. 266.

In the case of OnOrgWld, Francis Fallon proposes that apparently Christian features (such as the role of Jesus Christ) reflect Valentinian rather than orthodox Christian influence.9 Hans Bethge notes that Jewish, rather than Christian, influence is a \"dominant and especially characteristic element in OnOrgWld''.10 Birger Pearson has eloquently articulated the view that HypArch and OnOrgWld represent a Gnostic midrash on the early chapters of Genesis. Finally, a growing body of scholarly literature emphasizes the influence of Jewish apocalyptic traditions on HypArch and OnOrgWld and the many parallels between the Gnostic documents and Merkabah mysticism.11 Like Metatron, Sabaoth is a complex figure who, as Francis Fallon has noted: \"arises from the conflation of three figures: those of the God of the OT, the leading angels, and the apocalyptic visionary.\"12 Both HypArch and OnOrgWld depict Sabaoth as the repentant son of Ialdabaoth, the Demiurge. Although Sabaoth and Ialdabaoth are juxtaposed in these documents, other sources blur the boundaries between the two figures. Structurally, the rehabilitated Demiurge of Valentinianism and the repentant figure of Sabaoth in HypArch and OnOrgWld greatly resemble one another. In both cases, the biblical God is transformed from a negative figure into a vice regent for the higher God, once he acknowledges the latter's authority. The ability of a figure called Sabaoth and/ or Ialdabaoth to function as a vice regent of the higher God and an opponent of the Devil is attested in a number of places. 13 According to Epiphanius, 8 Bare, L'Hypostase des Archontes, pp. 1-48.

For example, in Valentinian sources, the Demiurge, himself, rules the psychic class (those who have free choice and can either be saved or damned), which is composed of both Jews and orthodox Christians. Furthermore, the Demiurge is not evil, as in HypArch and OnOrgWld, but ignorant, and appears willing to genuininely repent. Like Sabaoth, he is portrayed as an intermechary being, between the truly good pleromatic entities and his son, the Cosmocrator or"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"SABAOTH'S REHABIUTATION 127 the Archontics considered the Demiurge -whom they called Sabaoth rather than Ialdabaoth -to be the God of the Jews, while they depicted the Devil as his son and opponent: And Sabaoth, they say, is the God of the Jews, and the Devil is an evil son of his; and, being from earth, he opposes his own father. And his father is not like him, nor again is he the Incomprehensible God whom they call the Father'4 The actual identification of Sabaoth and laldabaoth is reflected in the doctrine of Severus, who portrays a figure known as both Sabaoth and Ialdabaoth as an intermediary ruler between the true God and the Devil: There is, in an unnamed highest heaven and aeon, a good God. The Devil, he says, is the son of the great ruler over the host of the powers, whom he now names, Jaldabaoth, now Sabaoth. This one who was born from him is a serpent. He was cast down by the power above to the earth15 As Fossum notes: \"According to both the Archontics and Severus, it is the devil, and not Sabaoth, who is responsible for the evils in the world..... Sabaoth, the chief of the demiurgic powers and the ruler in the seventh heaven, has retained his basic position as God's viceregent\" .16 Following his repentence, Sabaoth is \"caught up\" by Sophia and Zoe in H ypArch 95: 19ff. The ascension of Sabaoth reflects the apocalyptic tradition of the ascent of the seer. As we have seen, this theme also appears in 3 Enoch. Although Enoch is not described as repentant, he is chosen for his apotheosis because he is the only righteous individual among a generation of sinners, just as Sabaoth is the only righteous archon. Mter he ascends, Sabaoth is installed as the ruler of the seventh heaven, which is described as \"below the veil between above and below.\" (HypArch 95:20-21). The existence of a heavenly veil which separates the abode of God from the world is linked to the biblical tradition of the veil in the desert shrine (Ex. 26:33) and the Holy of Holies in the Temple (2 Chr. 3:14). In later Judaism, this veil was transferred to heaven, where it was called the viylon, the pargod, or the paroket.

Both the Gnostic and Jewish sources inherited the earlier Jewish apocalyptic tradition of a figure enthroned at the entrance of God's dwelling place. Upon his enthronement in the seventh heaven, Sabaoth receives the divine name \"God of the forces,\" which parallels the ascension, enthronement (at the entrace of the seventh hekhal), and re-naming of Metatron as the \"lesser YHWH\" in 3 Enoch. In many respects, the tale of Sabaoth in OnOrgWld resembles the version in HypArch. Nevertheless, there are significant differences between the two accounts. The first feature I will examine follows the repentance of Sabaoth: \"Then Pistis Sophia stretched forth her finger, and she poured forth upon him [Sabaoth] light from her light\".18 A close parallel to this tradition appears in 3 Enoch 13, where Metatron declares: \"Out of the abundant love and great compassion wherewith the Holy One, blessed be He, loved and cherished me more than all the denizens of the heights, he wrote with his fmger, as with a pen of flame, upon the crown which was on my head.\"19 Although the description in OnOrgWld is more terse, the basic scenario is the same -a divine being stretches forth a finger and pours light on a vice regent figure in what appears to be a kind of annointing. 17 Although problematic in places, the most thorough discussion of the cosmic veil in Gnostic and Jewish sources is in 0. Hofius, \"Der Vorhang vor dem Thron Gottes,\" Wissenschqftliche Untersuchungen zum Neuen Testament 14, Tubingen, 1972. The relationship between the veil in HypArch and OnOrgWld and the veil in Jewish lit-erature is also discussed by Fallon, Enthronement qf Sabaoth, p. 55; Gruenwald, From Apocafypt= to Gnosticism, pp. 211-217; Alexander, \"3 (Hebrew Apocalypse oD Enoch,\" p. 236. In Kabbalah, p. 18, Scholem notes that \"In another form, this con-cept of the pargod (i.e. to separate the ministering angels from God) was taken over by second century non :Jewish Gnostics.\" Fishbane, \"The 'Measures' of God's Glory in the Ancient Midrash,\" p. 61, discusses the signficance of the mylon in a Jewish text (Sijre 355) which exhibits other parallels with Gnostic sources. 18 OnOrgWld 104:3-5. Fallon, op. cit., pp. 94-95, notes that the motif of the out-stretched finger occurs in two passages from interestamental literature, Jub. 25: II and IQS 11:2, and writes that \"Again we have a small motif drawn from intertes-tamental Judaism, apocalyptic Judaism, rather than the OT or NT. On the other hand, while the finger of God 1s also referred to in both the OT and the NT, there is never an emission corning from it.\" 19 Metatron is basically transformed into a Light-Man, such as Michael in TestAbr 7 (Rec. A). Fallon, Enthronement qf Sabaoth, pp. 91-94, notes the parallel between the intertestamental Jewish tradition of the Light-Man and the \"Man and his light\" (a separate figure from Sabaoth) in OnOrgWld !04:2-3."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"SABAOTH'S REHABILITATION 129 The next set of features involves the ascension and enthronement of Sabaoth. Mter Sabaoth is snatched up to the seventh heaven, Pistis Sophia establishes a kingdom for him above the twelve gods of Chaos (OnOrgWld 104:23-26). Sabaoth fashions a dwelling place and a throne-chariot called Cherubin, whose \"forms (morphaz) amount to sixty four forms and seven archangels who stand before him. It is he who is the eighth, since he has authority. All the forms amount to seventy two for from this chariot the seventy two gods received a pattern. They received a pattern to rule the seventy two languages of the nations.\" (OnOrgWldl04:31-105-16) This section has many parallels with Merkabah material and specifically with the depiction of Metatron in 3 Enoch. Thus, in chapter 3, Metatron declares: \"I have seventy names, corresponding to the seventy nations [or \"tongues\"] of the world,\" while chapter 17 mentions \"seventy two princes of the kingdoms in the height, corresponding to the seventy two nations of the world.\" Both Sabaoth and Metatron are clearly being invested with the authority of God's vice regent. The creation of angels in OnOrgWld (105:16-106:3) differs from the account in HypArch in a number of ways, but one is particularly relevant. OnOrgWld depicts Sabaoth as creating \"a congregation [ekklesia] of angels, thousands and myriads\". This detail almost certainly reflects the influence of Daniel 7, where the Ancient of Days is depicted in like language. 20 As we have seen, Merkabah sources also employed imagery from Daniel 7 to characterize the vice regent figures Metatron and Akatriel. Like these Jewish angelic vice regents, Sabaoth is therefore depicted as the Ancient of Days from Daniel 7:9-1 0 -an enthroned judge surrounded by thousands and myriads of angels. I have thus far concentrated on the parallels between Sabaoth and Metatron, but there are also signif1cant parallels between Abathur and Sabaoth. Both Abathur and Sabaoth are depicted as judges enthroned at the entrance of the World of Light. Each figure is intimately related to the actual demiurge of the world, either as his father or his son. Furthermore, both Abathur and Sabaoth are depicted as creators in their own right: Abathur creates Ptahil and Sabaoth creates a host of angelic beings. Indeed, if we accept the \"As noted by Fallon, Enthronement of Sabaoth, p. 106. Cf. I Enoch 14:22; 60:1; 71 :8; Rev. 5:11."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"130 CHAPTER SIX link between the name Abathur and the title \"father [aba] of the uthras,\" there is a precise analogy with Sabaoth since the original form of the name Sabaoth was yahwe seba'ot or du yahwe seba'ot, meaning \"he who creates the [heavenly] hosts\".21 The parallel I would like to focus on, however, is that both Abathur and Sabaoth are portrayed as rehabilitated figures. In a number of ways, the Mandaean figures Y oshamin, Abathur, and Ptahil resemble the fallen angels of I Enoch 6-11.22 The connection between the Mandaean uthras and the fallen angels is primarily, but not solely, based on their common fall from grace following an act of rebellion. Another important but less obvious parallel between the two sets of figures is that both are related to the image of a polluted priesthood. We have already seen that Yoshamin, Abathur, and Ptahil were characterized as heavenly priests who corrupted themselves by rebelling against the Great Life. A number of scholars have argued that the fall of the angels in I Enoch 6-16 should be interpreted as a mythically formulated attack on the polluted or fallen priests in Jerusalem. 23 On a mythical level, therefore, the fallen angels symbolize the fallen priests. David Suter has suggested further that the chief sin of the fallen angels was their improper sexual union with human women.24 The emphasis on the sexual nature of the angels' sin mirrors the extreme concern for the sexual purity (and contemporary pollution) of the human priesthood. It is unclear to what degree the fall oflight beings such as Yoshamin, Abathur, and Ptahil is linked to the issues of sexual purity and pollution. In general, however, these issues are extremely important in Mandaean mythology and ritual.25 For 21 See Frank Cross, Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic, pp. 69-70. 22 Carl Kraeling, \"The Mandaic God Ptahil,\" p. 156, has written that Ptahil, \"approximates, at his worst, only the fallen angels or the revolting Lucifer, and not the demiurgic archons of Manicheism.\" 23 See George Nickelsburg, \"Enoch, Levi, and Peter: Recipients of Revelation in Upper Galilee,\" Journal qf Biblical Literature 100, 1981, pp. 586-587; David Suter, \"Fallen Angel, Fallen Priest: The Problem of Family Purity in 1 Enoch 6-16,\" Hebrew Union College Annual 50, 1979.

Hibil Ziwa, however, is extremely careful not to consummate the marriage with Zahariel, presumably because he wants to avoid sexual pollution. 27 The importance of sexual purity for heavenly priests is also emphasized in the depictions of Sislam Raba as the archetype of the proper bridegroom and priest. 28 The requirement of sexual purity for angelic priests is mirrored by the strict sexual regulation of human priests in Mandaeism. Thus, a priest must come from a priestly family, he cannot be the son of a woman guilty of adultery, nor the son by a second marriage of a widow. Furthermore, he cannot be physically blemished, circum-cised, impotent or a eunuch. He must marry and his wife must come from a priestly family, be a virgin at the time of marriage, and neither she nor the instructor's wife can be menstruating during the period of priestly ordination.29 The key difference between the fallen uthra priests in Mandaeism and the fallen angelic priests in I Enoch 6-16 is that the fallen uthras 26 Gmza, pp. 150-173.

I sowed in them pregnancy and birth and with sexual desire I enflamed them and caused love to dwell in both of them .....

Like Abathur and his kin, Sabaoth is rehabilitated in HypArch and OnOrgWld. The rehabilitation of Abathur and Sabaoth is extremely significant, for it allows them to represent God's interests in the sub-pleromatic realm and to function as God's vice regent. It also provides a model or paradigm for human beings to emulate. All human beings are, in effect, fallen figures according to Gnostic and Mandaean doctrine. The rehabilitation of Abathur and Sabaoth therefore signifies the potential for profound transformation, even rehabilitation, of human beings. The rehabilitation of these fallen figures also represents a step away from a radical dualism between earthly and pleromatic powers, toward a more ambivalent theological position. 30 In her work on the Mandaean figures Ruha and Sitil, ]. ]. Buckley has repeatedly emphasized that the common scholarly interpretation of Mandaeism as an essentially dualistic phenomenon must be re-evaluated in light of the great importance of intermediate theological figures and categories. Instead of a dualistic view of Mandaeism, Buckley supports a tripartite model. Within this structure, opposing elements are separated and mediated by figures and categories that are betwixt and between. According to Buckley, the focus on dualism has prevented scholars from apprehending the basic ambivalence of figures like Ruha. Although Ruha is frequently portrayed as a negative being of the World of Darkness, she is also described as having a positive, heavenly dimension in Mandaean sources. Furthermore, there is a correspondence between the divine figure Ruha and the anthropological category ruha, which signifies the human spirit, an entity which exists between the body and soul, and is a necessary component in the salvation of the individual.31 30 See the comments of Jonas in Gnosis und spatanttkr Geist, I, p. 341, \"what the middle beings were to 'mediate,' was exactly the realization of otherwise merely abstract dualism.\" and p. 337, n. 2, \"The basic thought of atonement for the demi-urgic entity -preCisely because of his bent towards creation -is of extraordinary (Gnostic) significance.\" As cited inJ.J. Buckley, Female Fault and Fu!filment, p. 29; c£, ibid., pp. 14-15, where Buckley describes the figure of Elohim in the Gnostic Book Bamch as follows: \"A middle and, seemingly, a mediating being, Elohim makes the dualism exphcit and tangibly real. He is the cause of the separations, and he is the first to realize the Implicatwns of these; his own trapped spint perfectly parallels his imprisoned life in the upper world.\" 31 Concerning the mha, Buckley, Female Fault and Fu!filment, p. 21 writes \"Situated between body and soul, the spirit, always regarded as female, wavers between good"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"SABAOTH'S REHABiliTATION 133 The key to understanding the ambivalance of Ruha and other Mandaean figures is the concept of the dmuta or \"ideal (heavenly) counterpart\".32 As Buckley writes: The dmuta expresses, moreover, the paradoxical fact that entities may show themselves as both good and evil, may possess both higher and lower characteristics. Not only human beings, but also defective Light World beings -Ruha among them -have their upper images in Msunza Kusta [a region of the upper or ideal world]. The dmuta furnishes a solution to the static, dualistic model: it lends a dynamic feature to Mandaean mythological thought as well as to the anthropological speculation. 33 Like Ruha, Abathur has a lower incarnation, known as Abathur Muzania (Abathur of the Scales) and an ideal heavenly counterpart or dmuta, known as Abathur Rama (Abathur the Lofty). Abathur's split personality mirrors his ambivalent functions within Mandaean mythology. On the one hand, by gazing below the World of Light, Abathur initiates the creation of the physical world, an act which compromises his and the Pleroma's unity. On the other hand, Abathur becomes a vehicle for the re-unification of the World of Light by identifYing the perfected souls which may return to their pleromatic homeland. Thus, as both initiator of creation and judge of ascending souls, Abathur is the catalyst for change in both directions. Abathur's liminal, transformative functions are paralleled by his spatial position at the entrance of the World of Light -a location which is equally at the end of the physical world and at the beginning of the Pleroma. I conclude my discussion with an exploration of the etymology of the name Abathur. The origin of the name Abathur has long puzzled scholars of Mandaean religion. According to Wilhelm Brandt, the name Abathur may be read as a contraction of the words aba (Mandaic = father) and uthra (Man. = divine being, similar to angel).34 Thus, aba d-)utria (\"father of the utras\") > Abathur. Against this explanation some scholars have supported an Iranian etymology.35 According to this position, the name Abathur is based and evil, between higher and lower instincts .....

However, as Svend Pallis has pointed out, the word tura does not exist in Iranian, and was only reconstructed by Andreas on the basis of a Sanskrit noun tufa, \"lever, beam,\" and a verb tulayati, \"to weigh.\"36 In addition, the word oj]a only appears in Neo-Persian, indicating that the name Abathur would date from 800 C.E., which is extremely unlikely.37 In place of the unsatisfying Mandaean and Iranian reconstruc-tions, I would like to propose a new etymology for the name Abathur. Rather than the \"father of the uthras\" or the \"one with the scale,\" the name Abathur may reflect a combination of the Mandaic words aha = \"father\", and thur(a) or thor(a) = \"bull\". Thus, the name Abathur should be read \"Father Bull\". Although one would expect a final aleph in the Mandaic (and generally Aramaic) word for \"bull\", the name Abathur may preserve an older Aramaic or North-West Semitic form, thor, which lacks the definate article ending, aleph. 38 In any case, personal names often do not conform to standard morphological patterns. Indeed, even if the form were originally Mandaic, it is possible that the final vowel dropped out, just as it does in the other hypothetical reconstructions we have cited: Aha dUtre > Abathur and oj]a (g) tur[a], > Abathur. In addition to this linguistic argument, there is an intriguing matrix of associations between Abathur and another divine figure known by an epithet remarkably close to \"Father Bull\", namely the Canaanite god El. In a number of passages, El is referred to as t6ru <i[ abuhu or \"Bull El his father\". 39 In these passages, the \"son\" in question is the storm god Baal. The name Abathur looks remarkably like a metathesis of Das Johannesbuch der Mandder, p. XXIX and Kurt Rudolph, Theogonie, KoSTIWgonie und Anthropogonie, pp. 122-123. Both scholars base their views on Andreas' artificial Iranian etymology. 36 Svend Fallis, Mandaean Studies, Amsterdam, 1974, p. II!. 37 Ibid. Fallis' position is supported by Rudolph Macuch, who writes in his Handbook ofClasszcal and Modern Mandaic, Berlin 1965, p. 211, n. !56, that \"Andreas' artificial etymology (c£ Brandt, Judische Bapttsmen, p. 147; Liclzbarski, Jb, p. XXIX) doubted by Noldeke (ZA 1916, p. !57) and refuted by Fallis (MSt, pp. lllxll4) is made still more improbable by the pronunciation of the name.\" 38 In fact, the U garitic word for \"bull\" is thor, which lacks a final vowel except as a case ending. This is not to 1mply that the name Abathur preserves an archa-ic Ugaratic form, but it does indicate a potential transition from an older form which lacked a final aleph (= definate article), to one which incorporated it. 39 C£ A.

And then, bring the bull, Qadiael: tame him and fasten a yoke upon him and he shall plough furrows in the hills and we will sow seed so that the worlds and ages may eat thereof '\"42 In addition to their common epithets, both Abathur and El are depicted as fathers of the lesser gods (including the demiurge) and as enthroned judges. Above we examined the Mandaean traditions which portrayed Abathur has the father of the demiurge. Turning to El, we find a similar profile. In a number of passages, El is explicitly called 'abu bani 'ili or \"father of the gods\".43 Just as Abathur creates Ptahil, who in turn creates the physical world, El fathers Baal who is the demiurge proper in Canaanite mythology. The distinction between El as a god of theogony and Baal as a god of cosmogony is articulated clearly by Frank Cross in his book Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic: \"'El is creator, the ancient one whose extraordinary procreative powers have populated heaven and earth, and there is little evidence that his vigor has flagged. Myths of 'El perceive creation as theogony. Myths of Ba'l view creation as cosmogony.\"44 As we have seen above, the same distinction between creation as theogony and creation as cosmogony may be applied to Abathur and Ptahil, respectively. 40 Geo Widengren has already noted the parallel between Tauriel and El. Cf. Geo Widengren, \"Die Mandaer,\" in Geo Wtdengren, ed., Der Mandaismus, Darmstadt, 1982, p. 59. 41 E. S. Drawer, Dzwan Abatur, p. 7. In].

In numerous passages, Abathur is characterized as a judge: Then Hibil Ziwa went and said to Abatur, \"Arise! set up thy throne in the House of Boundaries and take over sovereignty. And sublimate that which is sound (good) from that which is base when Man's measure is full and he cometh and is baptized in the jordan, is weighed in thy Scales, is sealed with thy Seal and riseth up and dwelleth in thy world.\"\" Likewise, El is described as an enthroned judge: 'El is enthroned with 'Attart <of the field>; 'El sits as judge with Haddu his shepherd, Who sings and plays on the lyre ..... 46 As Cross has noted: \"The exercise of authority by 'El over his council suggests that his role is more that of a patriarch, or that of the judge in the council of a league of tribes than the role of a divine king.\" Similarly, Abathur is primarily characterized as a judge, rather than a king, although Abathur may aspire to a royal function. 47 Besides these linguistic and functional parallels, there is another association between Abathur and El which must be noted. Perhaps the most striking connection between the two figures is not a direct parallel, but a common one. More explicitly, a triangle may exist between the figures of El, the \"Ancient of Days\" in Daniel 7, and Abathur. Cross has already noted the parallel between El and the Ancient of Days or atiq yomin48• Both figures sit in judgement, and both are called by epithets which stress their ancient age. In Ugaritic sources, El is called both melek <o[am, \"eternal king\" and malk:u <abu shanima, \"king father of years\". 49 The similarity between these epithets and the name atiq yomin, combined with the themes of enthronement and judgement, have led Cross to theorize that the author of Daniel 7 revalorized ancient Canaanite motifs in order to create the figure of the Ancient of Days: \"The text of Daniel 7 is of \"Dtwan Abatur, pp. 1-2. 46 Canaamte Afyth, p. 21, as quoted from the \"Rephaim\" cycle, Corpus des tablettes en cunitformes alphabettques, 20-22. 47 In fact, m \"Abathur's Lament\" or \"Abathurs Klage,\" Abathur is sometimes called \"King of the Shkintas\", although Abathur is descnbed as unfairly usurping tlus positron . ., Canaamte Myth, p. 16. \" Ibid., C£ notes 23 and 24 for Ugaritic texts."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"SABAOTH'S REHABIUTATION 137 particular interest. The apocalyptist utilized for his eschatological vision an old mythological theme: 'El sitting in judgment in his court. The identity of the Ancient One is transparent.\"50 While the figure of El clearly influenced the Ancient of Days in Daniel 7, the exact relationship between the apocalyptic figure and Abathur is less obvious, although, as we have already seen, a number of striking parallels exist between the two figures. The important parallels between the Ancient of Days and Abathur are: l. Abathur's enthronement as judge. 2. The epithet atiqa or \"ancient\" which is commonly attributed to Abathur. 3. The description of the thousands and myriads of angels who serve before Abathur. The parallels between Abathur and the atiq yomin may be explained by the direct influence of Daniel 7 on Mandaean theology or by positing that both Daniel 7 and Mandaeism drew on common sources. In any case, we have seen other features linking Abathur and El which are independent of the common connection with the Ancient of Days from Daniel 7. As a number of scholars have noted, the revitalization of ancient mythological elements is a characteristic feature of apocalyptic writings in general, with the parallels between Eland the Ancient of Days being only one example.51 The possibility that Mandaeism also produced a re-emergence of Canaanite mythological motifs, including those related to Abathur, is a topic which must be examined more closely, as must the links between Mandaeism and Jewish Apocalypticism. Thus, while it is possible that Abathur and the Ancient of Days are both influenced by the Canaanite deity El, it is unclear whether Abathur is also directly influenced by the figure of the Ancient of Days, or whether both figures incorporate common apocalyptic or pre-apocalyptic imagery. Obviously, the view that Abathur's profile as enthroned judge depends, at least partially, on Canaanite and Jewish sources, runs contrary to the standard opinion of a Persian origin for Abathur. According to Kurt Rudolph, the figure of Abathur reflects two profiles: 1. Weigher and judge of souls. 2. Creative light creature. These dimensions are combined in what Rudolph calls \"ein typisch \"synkretistiches\" Produkt der mandaischen Mythologie.\"51 Rudolph adds that Abathur's identity as weigher and judge of souls belongs 50 Ibid., p. 17. 51 This is the view of Frank Cross, Paul Hanson, and John Collins, among oth-ers. 52 Kurt Rudolph, Theogome, Kosrrwgome und Anthropogome, p. 138."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"138 CHAITER SIX to the oldest Iranian stratum of Mandaeism, while Abathur's function as Demiurge stems from the Jewish or \"semi-Jewish (gnostic) World.\"53 In light of the striking parallels between the descriptions of Abathur, El, and the atiq yomin in Daniel 7:9-10, Rudolph's (et. al.) conclusion concerning the Iranian origin of Abathur's identity as weigher and judge of souls may have to be ammended. Either the Mandaeans had already created an Abathur like figure before arriving in Babylonia and western Iran, basing it in part on Daniel 7:9-10 and/or other sources, or, the figure of Abathur was originally based on a combination of Jewish and Iranian elements. In this scenario, the Mandaeans or a group of proto-Mandaeans may have employed Canaanite and Jewish imagery as an original element in the creation of Abathur or in order to fill in the portrait of a pre-existing figure, which the Mandaeans derived from Persian religion. The possibility that the Mandaeans employed Daniel 7:9-1 0 in either creating or, if he already existed in some form, portraying Abathur is strengthened by the fact that Daniel 7:9-1 0 is written in Aramaic, probably in an eastern dialect, which, in any case, would have been comprehensible to Mandaic speakers. Besides these historical questions, there is a compelling phenomenological issue which must be addressed. Namely, what is the underlying significance of the adoption of El as a prototype or Vorbild for the figure of Abathur? The solution to this problem lies in the distinction between Abathur and the Great Life. As we have already noted, the Great Life is the highest god in the Mandaean pantheon. A perfect being of light, the Great Life does not create (for this would compromise its perfection) but emanates. The first and second emanations of the Great Life are Y oshamin and Abathur, respectively. Abathur compromises the unity of the Pleroma by gazing into the turbid waters of chaos, an act which produces the demiurge. For his impudence, Abathur is exiled from the Pleroma and enthroned at its entrance, a vantage point which allows him complete knowledge of the world and its inhabitants. In addition, Abathur takes on the capacity of weigher and judge of souls, as well as leader of myriads of uthras or divine beings. In Abathur's fallen incarnation, he is known as Abathur-Muzania or Abathur of the Scales. Yet, even after his exile, Abathur retains an 53 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"SABAOTH'S REHABIUTATION 139 incarnation or dmuta in the World of Light, who is called Abathur-Rama or Abathur the Exalted. Only in the eschaton, will the two incarnations of Abathur be united, along with the rest of the Pleroma. The figure of Abathur is a hybrid, composed, quite literally, of two distinct ontoi. On the one hand, Abathur is a creature of light, who dwells in the Pleroma, and on the other, he is a judge, enthroned outside (albeit, at the entrance) of the World of Light. As a being of light, Abathur is a dimmer reflection of the Great Life, since as the light is emanated, its quality decreases. It is well known that in Gnosticism, and as we have seen, in Mandaeism, a distinction is made between the highest god and the demiurge. Because in both Gnosticism and Mandaeism the highest god is a perfect being of light, and therefore perfectly transcendent, the act of creating the demiurge must fall to an intermediary divine being, who bridges the gap between the Pleroma and the physical cosmos. In Gnosticism, this divine being is a mother, Sophia. In Mandaeism, the creator of the demiurge is a father, Abathur, who is also enthroned as the judge of the world. Likewise, in Canaanite mythology, El is both the father of the demiurge and an enthroned judge. Thus, in El, the Mandaeans found a ready-made prototype for a wisened god of judgement and father of the demiurge. The revolution of Mandaeism was the creation of a perfect god, whose transcendence precluded any contact with the physical world. Yet, at this phenomenological stage Mandaeism encountered two dilemmas: how was the world created and how is it judged? In order to solve these problems, Mandaeism revitalized the ancient mythological dynamic between a god of theogony /judge (El > Abathur) and a god of cosmogony I divine warrior54 (Baal > Ptahil). 54 Like Baal, who struggles with Mot and Yam before he creates the world, Ptahil must combat the forces of chaos. If El was, in fact, a Vorbz!d for the figure of Abathur, then depictions of Baal may have influenced the development of Abathur's son, Ptahil. Indeed, a long suggested etymology for the name Ptahil, combines the verb patah, which means to \"open\" or \"create\" in Mandaic, and the word el or \"god\". Thus, the name Ptahil would mean \"God creates,\" a reasonable derivation given Ptahil's role as the demiurge. If Ptahil's father were associated with a god whose proper name was El, however, then his name might have the significance \"El creates,\" or \"El created,\" with Ptahil, himself, functioning as the \"object\" oflus own name, i. e. \"EI creates or created [Ptahil]\". For a discussion of the various ety-mologies offered for the name Ptahil, cf. Kraeling, \"The Mandaic God Ptahil\". Kraeling notes, pp. 153-154, possible b1blical parallels of the name Ptahil: I Chrorucles 24:16, the name \"Pethahiah\" (=pethah yah) and Joshua 19:14, the valley of \"Iphtah-el\"."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"140 CHAPTER SIX As noted by Cross, the Hebrew god Yahweh represents the integration of the defining features of El (the father of the gods and judge) and Baal (the divine warrior and demiurge of the cosmos).

Incomplete, because Abathur has a split-personality: Abathur Muzania and Abathur Rama. Abathur manifests ontological and functional features of both a transcendent being of light and an immanent creator and judge. In doing so, he bridges the physical and philosophical chasm between the Pleroma and the physical cosmos. It is quite likely that even if a figure such as El had not already existed to serve as a prototype, his characteristic features would have been invented in the figure of Abathur.55 55 Other possible trajectories of the figure, or, at least, the name Abathur have been noted by Steve Wasserstrom, \"The Moving Finger Writes; Mughirab Sa'id's Islamic Gnosis and the Myths of Its Rejection\". On p. 9, Wasserstrom notes that the laqab (\"nickname\") of either the Muslim rebel Mughira, or one of his followers, was \"al-Abtar\" (\"the one with tail docked, the one cut off, the childless\"). Wasserstrom writes that \"None of the conflicting etymologies of the nickname, how-ever, is convincing. None of these Arabic etymologies, naturally, refers to the most likely source of the name, which was in fact a widespread, variously employed reli-gious appellative.\" Among the \"various forms of the name abtr\" discussed by Wasserstrom is the Mandaic name Abathur. Wasserstrom notes further, pp. 24-26, that the \"anti-Messiah\" or the Dajjal, was also linked with the name \"Abtar\". It is interesting to note that one of the Arabic etymologies for al-Abtar, \"the one cut off,\" is a highly appropriate depiction of the Mandaean Abathur, whereas another ety-mology, \"the childless,\" directly conflicts with Abathur's image as the father of Ptahil."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVEN CONCLUSION Despite their differences, the figures I have examined clearly reflect the same theological type: the angelic vice regent. The angelic vice regent is an ally or, more precisely, a servant of God. As such, he performs functions for a deity who is transcendent (Gnosticism/ Mandaeism) or sometimes remote (Merkabah mysticism). Although the angelic vice regent serves God, his exalted nature is a potential source of tension between him and God. In the sources I have examined, this tension is expressed and, at least symbolically resolved in a number of ways. Either the angelic vice regent is portrayed as a formerly rebellious figure (Sabaoth; Abathur) who has repented and been rehabilitated, or, as in the case of Metatron, the possibility that the angelic vice regent may be mistaken for a second god is expressly undermined. Because he is God's servant, the angelic vice regent's relationship with God is not dualistic, despite the latent tension between them. Indeed, the angelic vice regent may even function as a remedy to radical dualism. This is clearly the case in Merkabah mysticism where the positive characterization of Metatron as God's vice regent preempted or possibly served as an orthodox Jewish solution to nascent Gnostic views of an inferior and evil second deity. In Gnosticism and Mandaeism, the valorization of Sabaoth and Abathur as angelic vice regents may reflect an internal, theological reaction against an earlier stage of radical dualism. As Gilles Quispel, Alan Segal, and others have argued, originally Jewish conceptions of an exalted angel appear to be the theological \"genotype\" which later mutated into Gnostic depictions of the evil Demiurge. Yet these same angelogical conceptions also provided the raw material for the primary theological alternative to the evil second god, namely, the angelic vice regent. Thus Ialdabaoth, Metatron, Abathur, and Sabaoth are all children of the same father. Indeed, the angelic vice regent and the evil, inferior deity are essentially mirror images of one another. The mutability of the two types is illustrated in V alentinian sources, where the Gnostic Demiurge, himself, is rehabilitated and thereafter functions as God's vice regent to a certain degree."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"142 CHAPTER SEVEN The angelic vice regent only achieves his exalted rank after he undergoes a process of angelification (Metatron) or rehabiliation (Sabaoth; Abathur). In other words, none of the figures we have examined is born an angelic vice regent. Instead, each figure is chosen to undergo a profoundly transformative experience. Therefore, the tale of the angelic vice regent is an optimistic one. It informs its readers that a fallen angel, like Abathur and Sabaoth, or a human being who belongs to a generation of sinners, like Enoch, can change for the better. This lesson must have profoundly affected the world-view of those individuals who learned it. Human existence was not hopeless. If he accepted the unique authority of God, it was possible for even the lowliest being to ascend the heights. What kind of individual would have identified most strongly with the angelic vice regent? In order to answer this question, we must first address the more general issue of what kind of communities produced the figures we have been studying. Drawing on the methodological model of Mary Douglas in Natural ~mbols, Alan Segal has reconstructed the social character of the Johannine community. According to Douglas, there is a dynamic interplay between a group's social structure and its symbol system.1 In Segal's words: \"they are mutually dependent. Sometimes social structure affects theology; sometimes the opposite. All we have to note is the frequent parallel relationship between a given social structure and a society's ideas of divinity.\"2 Douglas argues further that dualistic theologies, in particular, are produced by \"Small competitive communities [who] tend to believe themselves in a dangerous universe, threatened by sinister powers operated by fellow human beings.\"3 As Segal notes, the imagined or real persecution of such groups may be \"projected into hostility on the part of cosmic powers.\"' Segal employs this model to explain the theological dualism of the Johannine community, which stressed belief in Jesus while condemning traditional Jewish mediator figures and, in particular, the Prince of the World. In Segal's view, the antagonism toward these cosmic powers both reflected and reinforced the antipathy felt by the Johannine community towards Judaism. Thus, in the minds of Johannine Christians there was a 1 Mary Douglas, Natural Symbols Explorations m Cosmology, New York, 1973, pp 91, 122, 144-5, 153, 199. 2 \"Ruler of This World,\" p 251 'Natural Symbols, p 137 • \"Ruler of This World,\" p. 251."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION 143 symbolic connection between the oppressive Prince of the World and the oppressive Jewish community. A number of other scholars have employed similar models to explain the relationship between social structure and theological symbols in other late antique religions. As we saw above, David Suter and George Nickelsburg have argued that the negative depiction of the fallen angels in 1 Enoch 6-11 represents an attack on the Jerusalem pnesthood. The authors of 1 Enoch 6-11 may have considered themselves to be the rightful human priests. By attacking the fallen angels (::::Jerusalem priests), these pretenders created space for their own priestly aspirations. Once translated onto a cosmic plane the polemic against the Jerusalem priesthood gained added theological support. The interplay between human and angelic priests also plays an important role in the Mandaean rehabilitation of fallen uthras such as Y oshamin, Abathur, and Ptahil. According to Kurt Rudolph, at a certain point in the history of the Mandaean religion, the priestly class empowered itself and transformed what was originally a radically dualistic theology into a more monistic, ritualistic system in which human priests played a greater role. An important part of this social and theological transformation was the rehabilitation of fallen, cosmic priests such as Abathur, who were re-created in the image of the newly empowered human priests. Interestingly, a number of Mandaean legends depict violent conflict between the Mandaeans and the Jewish priesthood inJerusalem. Indeed, in a story commonly called \"Nebuchadnezzar's Daughter,\" a group of Jewish rabbis and priests demand that the Mandaean priests reveal their secrets or they will kill them. This suggests that conflict over proper priesthood was an important element of inter-religious polemics as well part of the struggle over internalJewish definition. The issue of clerical authority was also an important element in the development of Gnostic theology. According to Elaine Pagels, the theological debate between Gnostics and orthodox Christians was essentially a struggle over what Pagels calls \"spiritual authority\".5 Both sides of this debate accepted \"the correlation between the structure of divine authority and the human authority in the church.\"6 When Gnostics deprecated the demiurgic ruler of the 5 Elame Pagels, '\"The Demmrge and His Archons' -A Gnostic VIew of the Bishop and Presbyters?\" Harvard Theologzcal Remew 69, 1976, p 303.

But the bishop's demands, warnings, and threats, like those of the Demiurge himself, can no longer touch the one who has been 'redeemed.\"\" It is important to note, however, that Pagels distinguishes between those Gnostics who depicted the Demiurge in unremittingly negative terms and those who basically rehabilitated him: We might expect that those [Gnostics] who characterize the demiurge as implacably hostile, arrogant, and envious of the higher powers place themselves in a position of unremitting opposition to the authorities that bear 'the demiurge's' name and claim to exercise his power. On the other hand, such groups as the Valentinians who characterize the demiurge as the instrument of the higher 'psychic church,' thereby indicate that they are willing to accept the structure of the orthodox church as a provisional one (for psychics, if not for themselves).\" Pagel's distinction will play a signficant role in my own speculation on the community which characterized Sabaoth as an angelic vice regent. David Halperin has attempted to reconstruct the Sit;:; im Leben of the Hekhalot texts. Although developed independently, Halperin's interpretation is remarkably similar to Pagel's model (as he himself, notes). According to Halperin, the authors of the Hekhalot literature were the 'am ha'ares (\"people of the land\"). These common folk \"had every reason to detest the rabbis\" in Halperin's view. 9 Yet, because the 'am ha'ares do not appear to have established their own religious institutions, their attitutude towards the rabbis was highly ambivalent. On the one hand, they thought of them as \"arrogant tyrants,\" and on the other hand, they acknowledged them as \"expert administrators\" of the religious inheritance. 10 The result of this ambivalence was that the authors of the Hekhalot literature attacked the rabbis while pseudepigraphically invoking the authority of important rabbis and employing rabbinic traditions. The antipathy for the rabbis was projected onto the cosmic plane, where the tension between the rabbis and the 'am 'Ibrd., p. 314. 8 Ibrd , p 324. 9 The Faces qf the Chanot, p. 442. 10 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION 145 ha'ares was reflected in the enmity between angels (rabbis) and humans ('am ha'ares). Accordingly, human ascent to heaven encoded a rebellion against an oppressive, rabbinic social structure as well as a threat to angelic authority. In another work, Halperin has extended his model to include the transformation of Enoch. According to Halperin: \"we might imagine that the figure of Enoch bears the hopes of certain disaffectedjews who themselves hankered for the status of Temple priesthood. In their fantasy, the high and mighty sinners (the angels) are cast down from God's presence, while saintly humble folk (the human Enoch) are elevated to it.m1 Several scholars have criticized Halperin's model, including Elliot Wolfson. 12 According to Wolfson the link between apocalyptic and Hekhalot ascents makes an attribution of the latter material to the am ha'ares problematic, particularly since we know so little about this group. Secondly, a'i\\ Scholem and Lieberman have a1reacl:y uoted, the authors of the Hekhalot material were well versed in the intricacies of rabbinic law, as well as rabbinic aggadah. It seems unlikely that the am ha'ares would have possessed such knowledge. Finally, Wolfson points out that the medieval, Ashkenazi transmitters of the Hekhalot literature would probably have avoided transmitting works which originated \"in a fringe group, or worse, in a group that was the fierce opponent of the rabbis. Despite its potential problems, Halperin's work provides a helpful segue into my own discussion of the type of community which characterized Metatron as an angelic vice regent. Instead of the uneducated 'am ha'ares, however, I propose that the authors of the Hekhalot literature may have been an educated group of individuals who identified themselves with the priestly class. Unfortunately, it is difflcult to determine the precise trajectory of the prie.,tly circles within Judaism following the destruction of the Temple. What is certain, however, is that the authors of the Hekhalot material identified themselves with the priesthood, even if they were not actual physical descendents of priests. Indeed, it is also possible, perhaps even likely, that any priestly authors of the Hekhalot literature were also rabbis. That is to say, they were involved in the creation and promulgation of aggadic and 11 \"Ascension or Invasion,\" p. 56. 12 See, for example, Peter Schafer's critical comments in 77ze Htdden and Mamftst God, pp. 158-161 Ellwt Wolfson, \"Halperin's 77ze Faces of the Charwt,\" ]ewrsh Qyarter[y Remew LXXXI, 1991, pp. 498-499."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"146 CHAPTER SEVEN halakhic traditions. This would explain the aggadic and halakhic expertise which the Hekhalot authors evince in their writings. In addition to the exoteric activities which they shared with their fellow rabbis, however, these priesdy rabbis either inherited or revived an important part of the priesdy (e.g. in apocalyptic and Qumran circles) patrimony: an interest in heavenly ascents and visionary experience. 13 The priesdy authors of the Qumran literature attacked the legitimacy of the Jerusalem priesthood, instead emphasizing their own connection with the angelic priests. This paradigm was inherited by the Merkabah mystics who patterned their own priesdy role and functions on those of their angelic counterpart Metatron. 14 The interest of these priesdy rabbis in mystical activities may have been opposed by more exoterically minded rabbis. Indeed, the Babylonian Talmud's version of Aher's encounter with Metatron may be evidence of this opposition. Thus, Halperin's view that depictions of angelic opposition to heavenly ascents in Hekhalot literature symbolize rabbinic opposition to the activities of the Hekhalot authors may be correct. Instead of reflecting a conflict between the rabbis and the 'am ha'ares, however, the social tension may have existed between two classes of rabbis: 1. Esoterically minded rabbis who identified themselves as priests and wanted to continue the priesdy traditions of heavenly ascent and visionary experience. 2. Exoterically minded rabbis who were opposed to this mystical activity. 13 I. Gruenwald, \"The Impact of Priestly Traditions,\" pp. 75ff. 14 For example, in 3 Enoch 2, where Metatron describes Ishmael as \"of the fami-ly of Aaron, who the Holy One, blessed be He, chose to minister in His presence and on whose head He himself placed the priestly crown on Sinai.\" Although there is a rabbinic tradition (BT Ket. 105b, BT Hull. 49a, etc.) that R. Ishmael was of priestly descent, he could not have been the \"official\" high priest in Jerusalem (as implied by BT Ber. 7a) since he was only a child when the Temple was destroyed m 70 C.E. Morray:Jones, \"Transformational Mysticism,\" pp. 20-21, writes, \"\\\\Then taking part in the celestial liturgy, the adept acts as the representative of the peo-ple before God, as well as being commissioned to declare what has been revealed to him. In other words, he performs a function analogous to that of the High Priest of the Temple. A passage [~apse §§147-149] found in some versions of Hekhalot Rabbati indicates that the adept, here typified by Metatron-as-Enoch, has taken over the priestly function of atonement.\" The high priestly function of Enoch in the heavenly Temple is asserted in Jubilees 4:25. For the explicit identification between Metatron as the heavenly High Priest and R. Ishmael as his earthly counterpart, c( 2 Legends qf tlu Martyrs, \"I have a servant ( 'ebed) on earth as you are my servant on high.

With the earthly Temple in ruins, the focus of the Hekhalot authors was on the heavenly Temple. The ideal figure in the heavenly realm was Metatron, who functioned as the high priest in God's tabernacle. As such, Metatron was the angelic counterpart to the ideal Merkabah mystic, R. Ishmael, who was also depicted as a priest. The characterization of Metatron as God's vice regent may reflect the desire of the priestly-rabbinic authors of the Hekhalot material for authority within the rabbinic establishment. At the very least, it indicates that the Hekhalot authors identified with the angelic vice regent and thought that they possessed a supra-angelic link or conduit to God, something which their opponents lacked. The typological association and identification between Metatron and the Merkabah mystics contrasts sharply with the antagonism between the derniurgic ruler of the world and the Gnostics, thereby illustrating the theological chasm between Merkabah mysticism and radical forms of Gnosticism. Identifying the authors of the Hekhalot material as a circle of priestly rabbis rather than uneducated folk has many advantages. First of all, the authors appear to have considered themselves or, at least, their heroes to be priests. As such, they probably perceived themselves as continuing earlier priestly traditions of heavenly ascents and visionary experiences, which may help explain the connections between apocalyptic, Qumran, and Hekhalot material. The attribution of the Hekhalot material to a group of highly educated priestly rabbis also explains why the literature's authors were so well acquainted with halakhic procedures and why they identified so closely with Metatron, the heavenly high priest and his earthly counterpart, R. Ishmael. My interpretation suggests an alternative to Halperin's view but it is just that -an interpretation. Like Michael Swartz, who has most recently speculated on the possible authors of the Hekhalot corpus -and rejected the <am ha'ares hypothesis -I would argue that even if we cannot identifY any single group with absolute certainty, we can at least \"point to ..... possible social locations of the phenomenon\". 15 The attribution of the Hekhalot traditions concerning Metatron to priestly circles jibes with Rudolph's reconstruction of the social class 15 Michael Swartz, Scholastzc Magzc: Ritual and Revelatzon zn Early ]ewzsh .Mystzczsm, Princeton, 1996, pp. 217-221. Swartz suggests other possible sources for the Hekhalot literature including groups active Within the synagogue and scribes."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"148 CHAPTER SEVEN wh1ch created the literature on the Mandaean vice regent Abathur. In both cases, priestly authors created angelic vice regents to function as ideal prototypes for their own priestly aspirations. The transformation of Enoch into Metatron taught the Merkabah mystics that a righteous individual in a generation of sinners could be transformed into an angelic being, even an angelic high priest in the heavenly tabernacle. Likewise, the rehabilitation of Abathur from a fallen uthra into a responsible, celestial priest served as a model for the human priest who was ritually polluted and required purification (i.e. rehabilitation), a scenario which was quite common due to the stringency of Mandaean purity laws. Although I have proposed plausible social contexts for the creation of Metatron and Abathur as angelic vice regents, the question of what kind of community characterized Sabaoth as an angelic vice regent still remains to be answered. Earlier I noted Pagels' distinction between those Gnostics who portrayed the demiurgic ruler of the world as entirely evil and those who characterized the demiurge as a repentant figure, who functions as \"the instrument of the higher 'psychic church\"'. In Pagels' view, such Gnostics \"thereby indicate that they are willing to accept the structure of the orthodox church as a provisional one (for psychics, if not for themselves).\" Pagels' observation is one of the keys to understanding the type of community which produced the speculation on Sabaoth. Like the Demiurge in Valentinian sources, Sabaoth is a repentant figure who is put in charge of the psychic church. However, while Sabaoth is rehabilitated, his father, Ialdabaoth, remains unrepentant. As I noted, this disjunction reflects a division of the biblical God into positive and negative dimensions. A division which Nils Dahl interprets sociologically: \"One might guess that this differentation corresponds to a distinction between the zealous opponents of the gnostics [symbolized by Ialdabaoth] and other Jews or, at a later stage, Christians for whom there was a hope of repentance [symbolized by Sabaoth].\"'6 By combining the observations of Pagels and Dahl, we may arrive at a picture of the group which produced the Sabaoth speculation. These Gnostics viewed Sabaoth as the ruler of the psychic church, that is, Christians and Jews who were not saved or damned by nature, but could choose to accept the true God. As Pagels' notes, such Gnostics may have even accepted the provisional authority of 16 Dahl, \"The Arrogant Archon,\" p 705, n. 36."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION 149 a repentant figure like Sabaoth, themselves.

Indeed, by creating the repentant and rehabilitated figure of Sabaoth, they may have hoped to inspire Jews and Christians to repent and accept the true God, themselves. If so, then Sabaoth, like Metatron and Abathur, would have functioned as an ideal prototype for indiVIduals who wanted to improve their lot in life or, even, to reach for the stars."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"APPENDIX A JESUS This study has examined vice regent figures in late antique Judaism, Gnosticism, and Mandaeism. Absent from the body of this study, however, is an extremely important vice regent figure who appears in a number of related religious traditions. I am referring to the fig-ure of Jesus, who functions as a vice regent in Christian, Gnostic, andJewish Christian sources. The methodological reasons for omit-ting Jesus from my general discussion of vice regency are two-fold. First of all, the introduction of Jesus expands the comparative frame-work of this study tremendously. The web of relations between Christianity, Judaism, Gnosticism, Mandaeism, and Jewish Christianity are extremely complex -not to mention the internal dynamics (i.e. in J ohannine and Pauline writings, the Church Fathers, etc.) within Christianity, itself. Providing a proper context for Jesus' role as an angelic vice regent would require an extensive examination of the links between Christianity, Judaism, et. al. Secondly, the number of relevant sources for the depiction of Jesus as a vice regent is enormous in itself, as is the secondary literature on specific features of Jesus' vice regency, such as his hypostatic character, his ascension and enthronement and so on. Therefore, a thorough treatment of this topic would require hundreds of pages or, in other words, a volume of its own. Although I cannot provide a definitive examination of Jesus as a vice regent figure, it is nevertheless important to point out and briefly discuss the ways in which Jesus fills this role. It is important because depictions of Jesus inherit many of the same Jewish tradi-tions which influenced other late antique vice regents and because the portrait of Jesus which emerges from Christian, Gnostic, and Jewish Christian sources is remarkably similar to that of other angel-ic vice regents and, in particular, to that of Metatron. In the fol-lowing pages, therefore, I will briefly survey the ways in which Jesus functions as a vice regent in these sources. Early Christian texts avoid employing the term angel when depict-ing Jesus, in order to emphasize his superiority and lordship over the angelic beings (e. g. Heb. l:2b-2:18).1 In later Christian writings, 1 As noted by Alan Segal, Two Powers zn Hea:oen, p. 219 and \"The Risen Chnst"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"152 APPENDIX A however, the identification ofJesus as an angel is made explicit. For example, Justin Martyr depicts Jesus as God's messenger and chief angel, even identifying Jesus with the Angel of the Lord in Exodus 23:20.2 Jewish angelogical traditions also played an important role in Jewish Christian depictions of Jesus as Christos Angelos.3 In addition to his identification with the Angel of the Lord, Jesus was linked with the \"one like a son of man\" of Daniel. In Matthew 25, Jesus is depicted as the enthroned Son of Man who will preside over the final judgement.4 The image of Jesus' enthronement at the right hand of God represents an exegetical transformation of Daniel 7:9-10; 13, and Psalm 110: \"The Lord said to my lord, sit at my right hand\".5 There is also evidence thatJesus, like the other angel-ic vice regents we have examined, was depicted in the image of the Ancient of Days of Daniel 7:9. As Christopher Rowland writes: in Rev. 1, 13 ff. the description of the glorified Christ derives in part from the description of the angel who appears to Daniel in Dan. 10,6, but he is also given attributes of God himself derived from Dan. 7, 9. Thus it would appear that the interest in God's form on the throne of glory which plays a small, but significant, role in Ez. l and l Enoch 14 is now fulfilled, to some extent at least, by the reference to a glorious angelic being endowed with divine attribut-es.'

The Epistle to the Hebrews teaches thatJesus is an enthroned high priest, who serves in a heav-enly sanctuary: \"ITesus] sat at the right of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, cult-minister of the sanctuary and of the true tent.\" (He b. 8: 1-2]) The writings of the Church Fathers also describe Jesus as a High Priest. For example, Tertullian writes that during baptism, Jesus clothed the human being in his own priestly garment: 'Jesus, the great High Priest of the Father, clothing us with His own gar-ment -'for those who are baptized in Christ have put on Christ' (Gal 3:27)-has made us priests to God His Father (Apoc 1:6), as John declares\" (Monogamy 7).10 Origen states that \"the Son of God is the High Priest of our offerings and our advocate (parakletos) with the 7 G.

(Prayer l 0.1 )I' Christian depictions of Jesus as the enthroned Son of Man and the heavenly high priest are important elements in the tradition ofJesus' ascension and enthronement. As I noted above, the chief biblical proof-text for Jesus' ascension and translation was Ps. 110:1 (\"The Lord said to my lord, sit at my right hand\") where Jesus was iden-tified with the second \"lord\" ( adonaz) of the verse. 12 Ephesians 1: 19-21 represents one example of this exegetical tradition, in which God raises Jesus from the dead and installs him in heaven as his vice regent: They are measured by his strength and the might which he exerted in Christ when he raised him from the dead, when he enthroned him at his right hand in the heavenly realms, far above all govern-ment and authority, all power and dominion, and any title of sov-ereignty that can be named, not only in this age, but in the age to come.\" Jarl Fossum has compared Christian traditions of Jesus' ascent and enthronement with I Enoch 71, where Enoch is taken up to heaven and identified as the Son of Man and with 3 Enoch, where Enoch is translated to heaven and enthroned as Metatron. According to Fossum: \"In the New Testament, it is Jesus who is the one being translated to heaven, and both traditions used to describe Enoch's heavenly status recur in the picture of Jesus.\"14 Another important element in the traditions concerning Jesus' ascent and enthronement was his investiture with the Divine Name. Thus, Philippians 2:6-11 declares: \"Therefore, God highly exalted him [Jesus] and gave him the Name above every name, in order 11 Ibid., p. 222. I cannot agree, however, with Sabourin's interpretation of this passage. This passage is reminiscient of the description of Akatriel in BT Berakhot 7. 12 For a discussion of jesus' ascent and translation, see Segal, Two Powers in Heaven, p. 207ff.

See also the more reserved observation of Peter Hayman, \"Monotheism -A Misused Word in Jewish Studies?,\" pp. 14-15, \"Whether or not the Enoch pattern of assumption to heaven and metamorphosis into Metatron was also at work here is difficult to say, because of the still unresolved problem of the date of the Similitudes of Enoch.\""},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"JESUS 155 that, at the Name of Jesus, every knee should bend, in heaven and upon earth and under the earth\". 15 The identification of Jesus with the Divine N arne is developed more fully in Gnostic sources such as the Gospel rif Philip 54, where the father gives his Name to the son: \"For the son would not become father unless he wore the name of the father.\" And the Gospel rifT ruth 38, where Jesus is actually iden-tified as the hypostasized Divine Name: \"Now the name of the Father is the Son.\" Scholars have debated the origin of these Gnostic traditions, alternately emphasizing Jewish/6 Samaritan,17 or Jewish Christian backgrounds. 18 In addition to providing evidence that Jesus was linked with the Divine Name, PhiL 2:6-11 indicates that Jesus was identified as the hypostatic form of God in early Christology. As Stroumsa writes, \"We may assume that according to this original conception, when Christ was 'in the form [morphe] of God,' [Phil. 2:6] his cosmic body filled the whole world\".19 The conception ofJesus as God's hyposta-tic body also appears in the writings of the Church Fathers and in the writings of their competitors, the Gnostics. In Dialogue with T rypho 128:2, Justin Martyr refers to Christ as \"Glory\" (doxa), \"Man\" (aner) and Anthropos, a series of associations which Gilles Quispel has linked with the hypostatic form in Ezekiel 1 :26.20 Quispel has also identi-fied a passage from the Gnostic Tripartite Tractate 66.10-16, which explicidy describes Christ as the form of the invisible God: \"[Christ is] the man of the Father, that is the one whom I call the form of the formless, the body of the bodiless, the face of the invisible, the word of [the] unutterable\".21 This passage not only depicts Christ as the hypostatic form or body, but as the hypostatic face of God, as well. A number of other Gnostic and Christian sources preserve the tradition of Jesus as the hypostatic face, including Exc. ex 17zeodoto 10. 6-11, \"God is above every thing; subordinated to Him is the Son, who is the face of 15 See \"Form(s) of God,\" p. 283; The Name qf God and the Angel qf the Lord, p. 293. 16 Gilles Quispel, \"The Jung Codex and Its Significance,\" in H.-Ch.

Colossians 1:15-16 refers to Christ as the \"image (eikon) of the invis-ible God,\" and adds that \"it is in him that all things have been cre-ated ..... all has been created through him and for him\".23 Christ's demiurgic function is also mentioned in John 1:3, 10 \"All things were made through him, and without him nothing that has been made was made ..... and the world was made by him\"; Hebrews 1:10 \"And you, Lord, laid the foundation of the world in the beginning, and the heavens are the work of your hands,\" and a number of other New Testament passages.24 Jewish Christian sources such as Hom. 18:4 also depict Jesus as the creator of the world: \"[God] gave to His Son, who is also called 'Lord', and who brought into being heav-en and earth, the Hebrews as his portion, and appointed him to be god of gods, that is, of the gods who received the rest of the nations as their portions\". 25 Jesus comes very close to matching the ideal profile of the angelic vice regent. He is variously portrayed as the chief angel, the heav-enly high priest, the hypostatic form of God, the demiurge, and the enthroned judge of humankind. Scholars have noted the striking 22 A. Segal, \"The Risen Christ and the Angelic Mediator Figures,\" p. 315, has written, \"Although Paul may be using language taken from his opponents, he char-acterizes his apostolate as proclaiming that the face of Christ is the glory of God.\" 23 See \"Form(s) of God,\" p. 284. 24 See The Name if God and the Angel of the Lord, pp. 195ff.; Nils Dahl, \"The Arrogant Archon and the Lewd Sophia,\" p. 699, n. 21 for a list of New Testament verses which refer to Jesus' demiurgic function; idem, \"Christ, Creation, and the Church,\" in Jesus in the Memory if the Ear!J Church, Minneapolis, 1976. 25 As cited in The Name if God and the Angel if the Lord, p. 218. Concerning this pas-sage Fossum writes, \"Thus, the Jewish Christians could in fact deny that the high-est ws the creator and accept the view that he created through the principal angel, the guardian angel of the Jews. This is no doubt a teaching of Jewish origin. The Jewish Christians identified the angel as Christ, the Son of God, while the Gnostics exploited the idea in another way and developed a dualism of opposition.\" On Jewish Christian traditions concerning Jesus' demiurgic role and his hypostatic func-tion (and the relationship of these tradtions with the Sifer ha-Bahir), see E.

At the same time that Christians were transferring features of Jewish angelic fig-ures to Jesus, however, they were also suppressing the belief in these same figures within their own nascent communities.

Indeed, the Perfect Man of Jili's al-Insanu 'l-ktimil appears, in many ways, to be a transformation of earlier Jewish conceptions of the angelic vice regent. According to Jili, the Perfect Man is \"our Lord Mohammed\" and \"stands over against the Creator (al-Haqq) and the creatures (al-khalq).\" That is, he is an intermediary between God and His cre-ation.' In the sixtieth chapter of al-Insanu 'l-ktimil, Jili describes the Perfect Man (i.e. Mohammed) as follows: The Perfect man is the Qytb (axis) on which the spheres of existence revolve from first to last, and since things came into being he is one (wahid) for ever and ever. He hath various guises and appears in diverse bodily tabernacles (kana'is): in respect of some of these his name is given to him, while in respect of others it is not given to him. His own original name is Mohammed, his name of honour Abu '1-Qasim, his description 'Abdullah ..... You must know that the Perfect Man is a copy (nushka) of God, according to the saying of the Prophet, 'God created Adam in the image of the Merciful,\" and in another hadith, \"God created Adam in His own image.\" ..... Further, you must know that the Essential names and the Divine attributes belong to the Perfect Man by fundamental and sovereign right in virtue of a necessity inherent in his essence.' The parallels between Jili's depiction of the Perfect Man and Jewish conceptions of Metatron are both numerous and striking. Like Metatron in Kabbalistic sources, the Perfect Man is portrayed as the pole or axis (Qytb) of the universe. He appears in different guises and \"bodily tabernacles,\" much like Metatron sometimes resembles an old man, and sometimes a youth. The Perfect Man is described as \"'Abdullah\" or \"the servant of God,\" just as Metatron is called God's 'ebed (\"servant\"). While Metatron is identified with the Shiur Qgmah or hypostatic divine form, Jili calls the Perfect Man a \"copy\" (nushka) of Allah, and elsewhere, he refers to the hypostatic \"Form of Mohammed\" (al-suratu 'l-Muhammadiyya).6 The Perfect Man also pos-3 See Studies in Islamic Mysticism, pp. 138ff. 4 Ibid., p. 104.

Finally, the Perfect Man is identified with Islam's chief prophet Mohammed, while Metatron is intimately linked (although not explicidy identified) with Moses. Besides the Perfect Man, himself, there is another intermediary being described by Jill in al-Insrinu 'l-krimil who exhibits parallels with Metatron and the other angelic vice regent figures we have exam-ined. According to Jill, the Ruh or \"Spirit\" is a supra-angelic being, who, though not identical with the Perfect Man, is identified as \"The Spirit of Mohammed\": God created the angel named Rith from His own light, and from him He created the world and made him His organ of vision in the world. One of his names is the Word of Allah (Amr Allah). He is the noblest and most exalted of existent beings: there is no angel above him, and he is the chief of the Cherubim. God caused the mill-stone of existent beings to turn on him, and made him the axis (qutb) of the sphere of created things. Towards every thing that God created he has a special aspect (wq:jh), in virtue of which he regards it and preserves in its appointed place in the order of existence. He has eight forms, which are the bearers of the Divine Throne (al-'Arsh). From him were created all the angels, both the sublime and the ele-mental.. ... The Ruh excercises a Divine guardianship, created in him by God, over the whole universe..... He is the first to receive the Divine command, which he then delivers to the angels; and when-ever a command is to be executed in the universe, God creates from him an angel suitable to that command, and the Ruh sends him to carry it out. All the Cherubim are created from him, e.g., Seraphiel, Gabriel, Michael, and Azrael.. ... The Ruh has many names accord-ing to the number of his aspects. He is named \"The Most Exalted Pen\" and \"The Spirit of Mohammed\" and \"The First Intelligence\" and \"The Divine Spirit,\" on the principle of naming the original by the derivative, but in the presence of God he has only one name, which is \"The Spirit\" (al-Rith).' The Ruh or \"Spirit\" is depicted as the means by which the world was created, much as Metatron is portrayed in kabbalistic sources. Like Metatron, who is identified with the \"Special Cherub,\" (kerub ha-meyuhad) and is the leader \"over the majestic cherubim,\" the Ruh is depicted as the chief of the Cherubim, who, according to Jili, pos-sess Jewish angelic names, such as Seraphiel, Gabriel, and Michael. 8 Furthermore, the Ruh has eight forms which support the Divine 'Ibid., pp. 110-112. 8 3 Enoch 48c."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"AL-JiLt'S \"PERFECT MAN\" 161 Throne, a motif which echoes the Merkabah and Gnostic traditions of the eight archangelic or cherubic forms.9 In the Gnostic text OnOrgWld 104-105, Sabaoth creates a throne-chariot called \"Cherubin\" which has eight \"shapes\" per corner, and seven archangelic beings to minister before it, while Sabaoth, himself, is counted as the eighth: And before his mansion he created a throne, which was huge and was upon a four-faced chariot called 'Cherubin.' Now the Cherubin was eight shapes per each of the four corners, lion forms and calf forms and human forms and eagle forms, so that all the forms amount to sixty-four forms and [he created] seven archangels that stand before it; he is the eighth, and has authority. All the forms amount to seventy-two. Furthermore, from this chariot the seventy two gods took shape; they took shape so that they might rule over the seventy-two languages of the peoples. Just as Metatron is commonly called the sar ha-panim or \"Prince of the Countenance,\" and is identified with the hypostatic face of God, so the Ruh is depicted as possessing \"a special aspect [lit. \"face'j,\" directed \"towards every thing that God created\".10 Finally, the Ruh \"excercises a Divine guardianship, created in him by God, over the whole universe..... He is the first to receive the Divine command, which he then delivers to the angels; and whenever a command is to be executed in the universe, God creates from him an angel suit-able to that command, and the Ruh sends him to carry it out.\" Likewise, in 3 Enoch 48c, Metatron is described as follows: I made every prince stand before him to receive authority from him and to do his will. I took seventy of my names and called him them them, so as to increase his honor. I gave seventy princes into his hand, to issue to them my commandments in every language ..... as it is written, \"So the world that goes fom my mouth does not return empty: he carries out my will.\" [Isa. 55:11] It does not say here, \"I carry out,\" but \"he carries out,\" which teaches us that Metatron 9 For Jewish and Gnostic traditions of the eight forms, cf.

The Koran, itself, lists the number of angelic throne-bearers as eight: \"And the angels will be on the sides thereof, and eight will uphold the Throne of thy Lord [yahmilu 'arsh rabbzka] that day, above them\" (Surah 69: 17). \"The Arabic term wa;h can signifY \"aspect\" or \"face,\" as in the Kuran 2:109, \"Wherever you tum, there IS the face [wa;h] of Allah\".

My comparative study con-firms the work of Steven Wasserstrom, who refers to a 'Jewish-Muslim symbiosis ..... Between Muslim and Jew, angels and origins were traded in the marketplace.\"12 Indeed, Wasserstrom has illumi-nated a kind of parallel life for Metatron in Muslim sources, even discussing a Shi'i amulet published in Pakistan in 1973 which invokes the aid of Metatron. 13 Many Muslim magical traditions closely resemble the Jewish tra-ditions I have examined above, including the classical depiction of Metatron as the guardian of the curtain before God. Some appear to add new elements to the Metatron myth, although even here Jewish sources may reveal parallels. A talisman entitled Kitab 'azimfi' ilm al-hikma wa-ma yatarataba 'alaih (\"The Great Book Concerning the Knowledge of Wisdom and What Derives Therefrom\") describes Metatron as holding a whip of seventy-three lashes.14 While I do not know of any Jewish sources which depict Metatron as holding a whip, this tradition may have some connection to the Hekhalot pas-sages §672 and 3 Enoch 16, two versions of the Aher/Metatron tra-dition. In §672, Metatron is punished as follows: \"Immediately they brought out Metatron to outside the Curtain (Pargot!J and struck him with sixty fiery lashes.\" Although Metatron does not possess a whip, himself, he is linked to the act of whipping. Even more suggestive is the version in 3 Enoch: \"In the same moment, 'Anafiel YHWH, the glorified, splendid, endeared, wonderful, terrible, and dreadful Prince came at the dispatch of the Holy One blessed be he and struck me [Metatron] sixty lashes of light and stood me on my feet.\" 11 3 Enoch 48c, as cited in Alexander, \"3 (the Hebrew Apocalypse ofj Enoch,\" p. 312. 12 Wasserstrom, Between Muslim arul Jew, p. 205. 13 Ibid., p. 199. . 14 Edgar Blochet, \"Etudes sur le gnosticisme musulmane,\" Rwista deglz studz orien-tal! 3, 1909-10, p. 295.

Among the tricksters I discussed was Hermes, whose career begins in Greek mythology and passes through a remarkable number of literary incarnations in a variety of lan-guages. 1 In this appendix, I will argue that depictions of Hermes have so much in common with those of angelic vice regents like Metatron, Sabaoth, and Abathur, that Hermes appears to straddle the boundary between the two types of mythological figures. In his study on Hermes as trickster, William Doty characterizes Hermes as an example of \"the Greek sense of a divine-human con-tinuum,\" which he contrasts with the \"sharp differentiation between the divine and human that was developed in Judaism and Christianity\".2 As we have seen, Doty's model is explicitly refuted by angelic vice regent figures in bothJewish and Christian sources, who blur the boundary between human and divine modes of being. Perhaps the most important parallel between Hermes and the angelic vice regent figure is that both embody the logic of media-tion. Indeed, St. Augustine even derived the name Mercurius (the Roman version of Hermes) from his role as mediator or \"medius currens,\" walking in the middle of two opposing individuals or \"quod sermo currat inter homines medius\".3 Another striking paral-lel between the figures is their ambiguous and polymorphous char-acter. Hermes, like Metatron andJesus, was depicted as an old man (sphenopogon) and a youth (achnous).' The Book of Krates, one of the Arabic Hermetic writings, actually draws on the image of the Ancient of Days of Daniel 7:9 in its depiction of Hermes.5 Upon ascending to heaven, Krates sees the following: 1 Including Greek, Latin, and Arabic. 2 William Doty, \"A Lifetime ofTroub1e-Making: Hermes as Trickster,\" in 1'.1ythical Tnckster Figures, p. 50. 3 Cw.

And I inquired about the old man, and it was said to me: this is Hermes Trismegistos.6 This passage is extremely significant, for it reveals that Hermes, like Metatron, Abathur, and Sabaoth, belonged to a trans-cultural but originally Jewish exegetical tradition which transferred the depiction of the atzq yomin to a lower divine or angelic being. Like Abathur, Hermes was identified with the phallus, and his chief symbol was a phallus erected on a herma or phallic pillar. 7 Hermes was also intimately linked with the care of human souls. Among the different functions Hermes possessed were caretaker of souls during sleep, weigher of souls of the dead on a scale (psychosta-sy), leader of souls (psychopompos) on their way to Hades, and soul rais-er (psychagogos) who led souls into this world, either for a brief visit or a new bodily incarnation. 8 In addition to these responsibilities, Hermes also played an important maieutic role (the term is derived from maia, \"midwife\" or \"nurse,\" personified by Hermes' mother Maia) and was even called a male midwife. As we saw above, both Metatron and Abathur were associated with the passage of souls into the divine world, during life and after death, respectively; while Abathur, and perhaps, Metatron, were linked with the weighing of the souls. Although neither Abathur nor Metatron was depicted as a midwife or nurse, per se, Metatron was characterized as the teacher of \"all the souls of the dead that have died in their mothers' wombs, and of the babies that have died at their mothers' breasts, and of the schoolchildren that have died while studying the five books of of the Torah.\"9 While Abathur's watc-house was described as the storage place for the pre-existent souls that have not yet descended to earth. 10 Festugiere, La Revelation d'Herm£s Trismigiste WHermetisme et 'lastrologie), Paris, 1959, pp. 384-400. 6 Translation from Geo Widengren, \"Hermetic-Gnostic Literature in the Arabic Language,\" in The Ascenston qf the Apostle and the He(JJ)enly Book, p. 81.

In fact, the identification of Hermes as heavenly scribe is pre-served in the Babylonian Talmud (Shabbat 156a): \"He who is born under Mercury will be of a retentive memory, because he [Mercury] is the scribe of the sun\". As we have seen, the role of priest was attributed to Metatron, Abathur, and Jesus, while Metatron was characterized as God's messenger and scribe.12 Because of his multivalent character, Hermes was easily equated with important figures from a variety of religious traditions. This process of identification, commonly known as interpretatio (following Tacitus, On the Origin and Situation qf the Gennans ch. 48), was extreme-ly popular in Late Antiquity. As Gerard Mussies has emphasized, however, the basis for equating two figures in late antique sources was never absolute similarity, but \"partial analogies\". 13 This is pre-cisely the situation in regard to Hermes and his counterparts. In Egypt, Hermes was equated with the god Thoth, who functioned as the divine scribe and messenger in Egyptian religion. Within the Christian tradition, Hermes was identified with a number of figures. For example, Justin Martyr compared Hermes with the Logos-Christ (I Apol. XXII2), while Conrad Celtes equated Hermes with John the Baptist in a wood-cut made for Petrus Tritonius' Melopoiae (an early sixteenth century songbook).14 Although Mandaean sources, them-selves, do not identify Hermes with any Mandaean mythological fig-ures, E. S. Drower noted the similarity between the Primal Adam and Hermetic depictions of Hermes and even argued that \"The Hermetic writings have so much which corresponds closely to reli-gious conceptions familiar to them in N asoraean gnosis that they [Mandaeans] would readily have identified the Hermes of the Poimandres as their own Manda-d-Hiia or Mara-d-Rabutha.\"15 Hermes was also identified with several figures from the Jewish tra-dition.
