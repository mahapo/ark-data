Although these texts have been viewed by scholars as secondary to the rest of the lohar, they have been particularly beloved by kabbalists themselves. This study demonstrates the significance of their doctrinal contributions to theosophical Kabbalah. I was initially attracted to these works because of a dis-crepancy between their traditional currency and the scholarly attitude toward them. There was a tendency, among critical scholars, to dismiss them as derivative or otherwise secondary to the \"main\" sections of the lohar. At the same time, they were apparently well beloved by many generations of kabbalists, with more editions of Tiqqunei ha-Zohar being produced than of the lohar itself. I set out, initially, to investigate the attraction of these texts for the traditional community. The first chapter of this study distinguishes between the main sections of the lohar and the material considered Tiqqunei ha-Zohar and Ra'aya Meheimna. The second chapter addresses the author's use of kabbalistic symbolism. The anonymous author of these works presents a xv"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"xvi Preface unified world-view that is unique and highly influential in the subsequent development of Jewish mystidsm. The hermeneutical methodology of Tiqqunei ha-Zohar is based on this author's conception of the kinnui, or symbolic euphemism, as the basis of his assodative method. The kinnui is the device through which traditional Jewish motifs are transformed into meta-physical symbols. This process of symbolization underlies the relationship of the mystic and religious authority. The author's tendency to \"read\" his doctrinal additions into preexistent loharic texts was important in the development of kabbalistic hermeneutics. This practice prefigured the methodology of much later exegesis of the lohar. The third chapter of this study examines the notion of a vocation of Jewish mystics, the maskilim. In the Tiqqunim, the maskil, or enlightened mystic, is the agent and interpreter of religious truth. The order of the maskilim recognizes the lohar as its mystical charter. Mystical illumination and enlighten-ment came from the practice of contemplative Torah study, utilizing the symbolic hermeneutic of the theosophical Kabbalah. Tiqqunei ha-Zohar and Ra'aya Meheimna portray the world as caught in an unfolding drama of catastrophe and mythic chaos. The author uses certain midrashic and loharic tradi-tions in a judidous and characteristic manner that distinguishes them from the rest of the lohar. The fourth chapter of this study will present the author's myth of prehistory, which is based largely on the sagas of the fall of Adam and the flood. The flood accounts are metaphors for the present experience of humankind, which is distinguished by qualities of brokenness and disorder. The heightened sodal and soteric roles of the en-lightened mystic, as well as the author's use of images of struggle, brokenness, and distension, have great effect on the develop-ment of subsequent kabbalistic movements and doctrines. Contemporary scholars have compared the role of the mystic to that of the legalist, to the detriment of the latter. This has led to some miSinterpretation of the author's relationship to the legal tradition, which the fifth chapter of this study attempts to resolve. In fact, the author makes judidous use of the tropes of Jewish law, so that the mystic's vocation at times"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Preface xvii overlaps with that of the legalist. In the light of this extensive use of legal material, this study demonstrates that the author harbored no antinomian attitude toward the law. This study further demonstrates that, far from being ambivalent, Tiqqunei ha-Zohar and Ra'aya Meheimna portray a unified view of this mystic's inner world. The sixth and seventh chapters analyze the theurgic char-acter of the Tiqqunim and Ra'aya Meheimna. These works re-sponded to the dilemmas posed by the myth of chaos with a theurgic religious practice that made wide use of his erudition in halakhah, Jewish law. The author's reinterpretations of halakhic dicta and rhetoric reflected the conditions of the fall and the flood. His use of rabbinical law and lore contradicts the scholarly opinion that there is an antinomian strain in his thought. An investigation of the rabbinic dimension of the Tiqqunim is particularly important, as the work's ascent to litur-gical and canonical status is due to the perceived authenticity of the author's interpretation of classical Judaism. The specific contribution of this work lies in a number of areas. The author's symbolization of halakhic material is unique and has not yet been dealt with in a conclusive manner. In fact, although the deep traditionalism of the theosophical kabbalah has been demonstrated by Gershom Scholem and his students, there have been, to date, few analyses of the relationship of specific areas of halakhah and the Zohar. The clarification of the author's ambilavent attitude to rabbinic authority is long overdue. The identification of a model of mystical behavior, which is such a constant theme in the Tiqqunim, is also a new area of research. Ideally, this study will serve as a modest bridging of the gap between critical scholars of this tradition and its pietistic practitioners, through under-standing the author's accomodation of rabbinic religiOUS tradi-tion into his mystical world-view."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"1 Tiqqunei ha-Zohar and Ra'aya Meheimna in Context The enlightened will shine like the brightness of the firmament (Daniel 12:3).

Both works are in-cluded in the Zohar, the classical work of Jewish mysticism. The author of the Tiqqunim was one of the last of the circle of scholars who composed the lohar. This mystic's expressive style and theological ideas stand out from the rest of the lohar. His works have a particular understanding of the mystic's role in society. The author of the Tiqqunim and Ra'aya Meheimna was very conscious of the tensions inherent in the mystic's relation-ship to Jewish law and society. When considered together, the works of this mystic have a coherent and unified theological position that encompasses the dominant themes of Jewish mys-ticism up to his time and presage its subsequent historical development. This study will examine this obscure figure and show his effect on subsequent Jewish spirituality. The lohar literature is the strongest expression of the me-dieval Jewish mysticism that is commonly called Kabbalah. The Hebrew word kabbalah means, literally, \"that which is received.\" This emphasis on reception reflects a tension between adher-ence to traditional religious structures and lore, on the one hand, and the renewal of the tradition through creative reinterpretation, on the other.2 Kabbalists reviewed the vast exoteric Jewish tradition and understood its inner dynamics in novel and compelling ways. The legal (halakhic) and homiletic (aggadic) structure of Rabbinic Judaism provided Kabbalah with its imagery, whereas its religious practices defined the param-eters of the kabbalist's experience. The strength of the Kabbalah lay in its perceived authenticity, in its evocation of the spirit of the law. Its theorists generally adhered to the most pious belief and practice. Kabbalistic truths, therefore, are best understood in the context of their source tradition, for Kabbalah is the product of a reconsideration of the universe of symbols pro-vided by classical Judaism. Although reinforcing the values and piety of Rabbinic Judaism, Kabbalah expressed the mystical desire for renewed experience of the transcendent and for the metaphysical un-derstanding of reality. Kabbalists claimed to experience the"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Tiqqunei ha-Zohar and Ra'aya Meheimna in Context 3 metaphysical ultimacies as well as the historical realities of Judaism. Kabbalah portrayed itself as the inner component of Judaism, the resolution of its underlying paradoxes and con-tradictions. The lohar is the preeminent text of the theosophical Kabbalah, the first great work of genius in this tradition. The lohar is not a single work, but a collection of some two dozen separate compositions, constituting, in published editions, over 2,000 pages of closely printed Aramaic text. These various com-positions experiment with a number of writing styles and rabbinic literary forms. Such stylistic variety may be either the result of multiple authors and strata of composition or the attempt of a single author to find his literary muse.3 Because of the sophistication of their ideas and their late setting, Tiqqunei ha-Zohar and Ra'aya Meheimna probably make up the latest chronological stratum of the lohar. Critical lohar studies, to date, have concentrated on the main body of the lohar, which is generally understood as having been compiled by R. Moshe Ben Shem Tov de Leon, of late thirteenth century Guadalajara, Spain. Contemporary schol-ars of Kabbalah, such as Gershom Scholem, Isaiah Tishby, and Yehudah Liebes have posited a process of literary development that can be charted within the confusion of the lohar's struc-ture. According to this \"documentary hypothesis,\" the mysti-cism of the lohar developed from a system based in philoso-phy to one based in theosophy. Midrash ha-Ne'e/am, which Scholem and Tishby considered the earliest material, presents the idea of communities of mystic rabbis. In later composi-tions, the mise-en-scene became more detailed, while the theo-sophical nature became more pronounced, so that the stron-gest literary compositions were those in which the mystical ideas were most clearly and daringly formulated. The culmi-nating texts of the lohar are the [drot, which describe convoca-tions in which several of the participants reveal anthropomor-phic visions of the Godhead and perish in mystical ecstasy.4 The literary style and language of the lohar are unique. Its structure, like other late midrashim such as Pirqei de-Rabi Eliezer and Tanna de-Bei Eliyahu, shows the unifying vision of a"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"4 The Enlightened Will Shine single hand.5 Often, a section will commence with a homiletic proem based on the static imagery of the Bible's Wisdom litera-ture. In a juxtaposition common to midrashic and medieval homiletical literature, a Pentateuchal exegesis will then be linked to this homily. This proem form was a movement away from the simple exegesis of a proof text toward the discussion of the interaction of the religious symbols in their own right. Although the lohar's central pretense is that it is a Tannaitic midrash, its rambling, lengthy form and idiosyncratic Aramaic are unlike any other rabbinic creation. Tiqqunei ha-Zohar (possibly \"Infrastructures6 of the lohar\") is structured around seventy lengthy exegeses of the first sen-tence of the Bible.7 Additional sections of Tiqqunim were col-lected and published in the Zohar Ijadash, an anthology of texts that were not included in initial editions of the lohar.8 The main text of Tiqqunei ha-Zohar is more powerful and coher-ent than the material in the Zohar Ijadash, which might have been considered secondary by the earliest editors, if not by the author himself.9 Tiqqunei ha-Zoharwas first published in Mantua in 1658.The Orta Koj edition (1719) represents editorial deci-sions originating in the school of the great theorist of Lurianic Kabbalah, Hayyim Vital, by way of his student Hayyim Alfandari. This edition has served as the basis for most use of the Tiqqunim in subsequent Jewish intellectual history. Its domi-nance is even more complete than that of the Mantua-Vilna edition of the lohar. Even so, it is clear that the Orta Koj edition is full of additions by later editors. The Tiqqunim themselves are monographs that flow into one another. Each Tiqqun is a homily that begins with the Hebrew Bereshit, or \"In the Beginning.\" A given Tiqqun may veer off in a number of directions or exhaustively explore one subject.lo The Tiqqunim abandon the format of the \"mystical novel,\"ll employed by the most literarily successful sections of the lohar, in favor of an unstructured associative method. The author sometimes seems to delight in his opaque style, in which the logical connections between subjects are often unclear. His cascade of images often resembles a process of free association. The Tiqqunim present a fevered melange, whose symbolic"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Tiqqunei ha-Zohar and Ra'aya Meheimna in Context 5 elements are drawn from mythic aggadot, philosophical terms, Divine names, linguistic mysticism, and rabbinic legal dicta. As scraps and fragments of these various traditions are in-voked and discarded, the reader is obliged to reconstruct the nuances of the associative flow. This associative method under-scores the author's spiritual obsessions, as he returns repeatedly to the themes that preoccupy him. The second treatise by the author of Tiqqunei ha-Zohar is called Ra'aya Meheimna, or \"The Faithful Shepherd.\" The Ra'aya Meheimna is composed in the form of a \"book of command-ments\" (sefer mi?Vot), a popular genre of medieval Jewish writ-ing. Books of commandments were produced by such seminal figures as Maimonides, Nalpnanides, and Menal)em Recanati. They commonly listed the commandments in the Torah and divulged their inner nature. In accordance with the conven-tions of this genre, every section of the Ra'aya Meheimna is centered around a particular commandment.12 The \"faithful shepherd,\" Moses, is exhorted by the members of the celestial academy to explain the mystical nature of the commandments, particularly, in the extant sections, the commandments regard-ing the sacrificial cult. This text has a more coherent literary structure than the rambling, associative Tiqqunim.13 The dialogues recorded in Ra'aya Meheimna and the Tiqqunim take place after the deaths of Shimon bar Yol)ai and his companions, in the heavenly academy. Participants in-clude, among others, the prophet Elijah, Moses, the incarnate Shekhinah, and God. There are references to the specific lore of the lohar: to persons such as the legendary Rabbi Cruspedai,I4 to the events of the Idrot,I5 and to the revelation of the Zohar.16 The author clearly intended to continue the romantic tradition of the lohar and subsequent works such as Joseph of Hamadan's Sefer Tashaq. The author of the Tiqqunim, unlike the author of the lohar, makes little effort to portray himself as anything but a medie-val figure.l? His attempts at pseudepigraphy are half-hearted, so that the Tiqqunim and Ra'aya Meheimna are riddled with anachronisms. The author often refers to texts that were plainly composed after the era of Shimon Bar Yol)ai. He makes anach-"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"6 The Enlightened Will Shine ronistic references to the targumim of Onkelos18 and Jonathan Ben Uzziel.19 His references to \"Ben Sira\"20 seem to refer to the medieval Alpha-Beta de-Ben Sira. A characteristic anachronism, impossible in the Tannaitic period, is the expression esh nogah, \"glowing light,\" literally the Spanish sinagoga, synagogue.21 The text also makes references to the lohar22 and to itself. 23 The Tiqqunim are, by their own definition, secondary and accessory to the lohar. Nonetheless, they are important as a bridge between the internal development of the lohar and the interpretive systems of subsequent kabbalists. As an early reader of the lohar and as a theorist in the same tradition, their author embodied the values of reception and development in-herent in the Kabbalah. Motifs and ideas that are secondary or unstressed in the Tiqqunim, thus gaining prominence in the subsequent development of Kabbalah. It has long been cus-tomary to deprecate the Tiqqunim as inferior, both literarily and theologically, to the rest of the lohar. It is the aim of this study to show that the Tiqqunim played an important part in the acceptance of the lohar as canonical literature."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"2 The Hermeneutics of Theosophical Kabbalah: The Symbolization of Sacred Text TiqqUnei ha-Zohar is one of the last great works of theosophi-cal Kabbalah.! Although there are claims for Tannaitic, Manichean, or Neoplatonic origins for many of the ideas of theosophical Kabbalah, its main locus seems to have been thir-teenth-and fourteenth-century Christian Spain. The first theo-sophical work was the Sefer ha-Bahir, a quasi-midrashic text of mysterious origin that first appeared in twelfth-century Provence.2 These theosophical kabbalists3 identified an esoteric dimension, an underlying \"soul,\" of Rabbinic Judaism. They also expressed impatience and dissatisfaction with understandings of that Ju-daism that were overly exoteric and rationalistic. Theosophical Kabbalah is a mysticism of language; the mystical experience that it authorizes consists of the contem-plation of the symbolic repertoire of the Jewish canon. This body of symbols included images and motifs from the Bible and Talmud's universe of narrative, geographical, cultic, and legal material. The symbols are employed to describe God's hypostatic emanation through the sefirot, the dimensions or realms of existence.4 7"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"8 The Enlightened Will Shine Religious experience and mystical practice developed from the mystic's encounter with the canonical text, which itself en-compassed all existence and metaphysical reality. Theosophical kabbalists saw the Torah as a primordial text, predating the creation of the world,s a living garment numinous with poten-tial meaning. Both the sefirot and the Divine letters were instru-ments employed by the kabbalist. The consonantal rendering of the Torah enabled the text to be read with variants or multiple meanings. The essence of the text, however, remained amor-phous, in a state of ongoing potentiality, defying limitation. The rabbinic sanction of multiple understandings of scrip-ture presumed that the Torah was a work of amorphous numinosity. This understanding of the Divine text allowed the kabbalists to continue the creative methodologies of classical midrash. In the same way, the most conservative of rabbinic values considered Torah study and dissemination the central format for enlightenment. Theosophical Kabbalah understood interaction with the Divine text through Torah study as equiva-lent, in erotic metaphor, with the adherent's union with the ineffable Divine.6 The energies of the Divine did not flow into the corporeal world in a set or orderly fashion; the sefirot did not interact in a fixed or static way. In fact, relationships between the sefirot shifted according to the rhythms of time and the relative as-cendancy of the powers of good and evil. The kabbalists tried to understand the patterns of these interactions, as well as the essential nature of the sefirot. Biblical verses were understood in terms of the juxtaposition of several symbols, themselves sym-bolic of various sefirot. Subject-predicate relationships and nar-rative images of movement in the proof text were understood as representing different patterns of sefirotic emanation. This sefirotic conceptualization often canceled the literal meaning of the text, replacing it with deSCriptions of the mythic function of God's emanation. The symbolic reading of scripture was intended to convey messages that are not easily communicable in their essence.? This function of the symbol was acceptable to even the most conservative theologians when seen in terms of traditional Jew-"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The Hermeneutics of Theosophical Kabbalah 9 ish values of God's ineffability and the final inadequacy of the reader's perception of the Divine. SCriptural texts contained at least two levels of meaning: nigleh (the revealed) and nistar (the hidden). The lohar often expressed the tension between these two levels in its image of the egoz, or nut, whose inner nature is concealed by an opaque shell.8 The divine text is both hidden and intellectually accessible. Its network of symbols was both a window to esoteric meaning and an indication of God's inef-fable nature. For the mystical adept, contemplation of the sym-bolic motifs presented by the text was the central means of mystical illumination. Texts that describe static relationships, such as the dimen-sions of the Tabernacle, the social roles of the Wisdom litera-ture9 or biblical genealogies, particularly lent themselves to symbolic interpretation. These overtly dry, irrelevant passages were thought of as encoded with esoteric meaning. The erotic images of the Song of Songs also lent themselves to interpreta-tion in terms of mystical experience. That text's images of erotic longing and pathos had long been allegorized in terms of the Jewish national experience. In the Kabbalah, its eroti-cism represented the frustrating transience of the quest for mys-tical union.10 Much of this literature was presented in the conventional literary formats of the Middle Ages: scriptural commentaries, books of commandments, and didactic works such as Joseph Gikatilla's Sha'arei Orah. Joseph of Hamadan, R. David ben Yehudah ha-I:Jasid, the lohar, and the works of the author of the Tiqqunim represent experiments in the \"mystical novel,\" anthologies of theosophical interpretations rendered in midrashic form. Tiqqunei ha-Zohar and Ra'aya Mehimna used the style of dialogue and narrative's developed by the lohar. They also displayed the didacticism of Gikatilla's works and other guides to symbolic reading of sacred texts. The Palette of Symbols Unlike the main sections of the lohar, which employ narrative and quasi-legalistic literary style, the Tiqqunim and, to a lesser"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"10 The Enlightened Will Shine extent, Ra'aya Meheimna are written in an impressionistic style that approaches stream of consciousness. Religious meaning is determined from the way a symbol is linked to other images and motifs to which it has some formal relation. The chain of association reflects the mental processes of the mystical author. His latent attitudes regarding rabbinic tradition can also be determined from the way that he utilizes aggadic motifs or halakhic dicta. Tiqqunei ha-Zohar's symbolic repertoire draws on two hermeneutical traditions in particular: the Torah's composition from the various esoteric names of God and the esoteric underpinings of the Masoretic traditions of vocalization and cantillation.ll Theosophical Kabbalah struggled with the dilemma of how to express the ineffable. The Jewish philosophical under-standing of the nature of God created the need for a concep-tual symbol of ineffability, if only to express the limitations of language. The names of God were understood as defining the contours of God's ineffability. There are various rabbinic traditions of a numinous and dynamic name of God. These traditions are alluded to in such remarks as \"The bottomless abyss of all creation is sealed in the name.\"12 The ancient traditions of the sacred names of God were handed down by Jewish mystical adepts under con-ditions of great secrecy.13 Nal;nnanides' statement that \"the whole Torah is names of the Blessed Holy One,\"14 awaiting recombination by the mystic adept, represents the emergence of an idea that had been available only to a restricted spiri-tual elite. Divine names were common to the twelfth-century IJasidei ashkenaz, particularly Eleazer of Worms in his Sefer ha-Ifokhmah and Sefer ha-Shem.1S This tradition of names culmi-nated in the notions of the forty-two-and seventy-two-Ietter names of God. These esoteric rabbinic traditions had filtered through Geonic circles to the I;Iasidei Ashkenaz, and from there to the Castilean theosophists.16 Tiqqunei ha-Zohar and Ra'aya Meheimna state that God may be called by all names, but He has no specific name.17 Holy names are descriptions of action, relating to the creator"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"The Hermeneutics of Theosophical Kabbalah 11 and his relationship to creation,18 for \"the Master of the World extends through those names and rules through them. \"19 One aspect of messianic redemption will be the cessation of temurot, the textual distinctions between names and their pronuncia-tions.20 Idolatry is seen as deriving from the demonization of the holy name YHVH.21 The author seems to have adopted the kabbalistic traditions of the Divine name, but the ubiquity of the Divine name is ultimately less profound than the general presence of other kinds of symbols. Another ancient tradition contributed to these works' un-derstanding of the nature of the Torah. This tradition under-stood the Hebrew alphabet as the material for the creation of the world. This idea was the animating principle of the ancient Sefer Ye-?irah, or book of creation. It is reflected in Tiqqunei ha-Zohar's adoption of early kabbalistic linguistic theories.22 The idea that the Hebrew alphabet houses nascent energies is re-flected in the talmudic statement that \"Befalel [the architect of the Taberbacle] knew how to combine the letters from which heaven and earth were created.\"23 According to this tradition, the consonants, the vowels, and the musical notes that accom-pany the Masoretic text control metaphysical energies.24 Each of these aspects of the text has a specific power. Sometimes \"the vowels are a prophetic voice and the notes of cantillation are weapons\"25 whereas \"syllables are contingent on thought, vowels are contingent on speech, and [consonant] letters are contingent on action.\"26 The semiotic qualities of the notes are also a factor in their use as images.27 Individual letters were recognized as having specific qualities.28 For instance, Tiqqunei ha-Zohar contains discourses on the esoteric meaning of the letter kaf,29 the distinction between the letters dalet and resh,30 the spatial dimensionality latent in the pontilistic letter yod,31 and the aural qualities of the vowels and notes.32 As mentioned previously, certain kabbalistic works, such as Joseph Gikatilla's Sha'arei Grah, have a didactic quality in that they instruct the adherent how to make his own analyses of biblical texts. Tiqqunei ha-Zohar often adopts the former di-dactic mode, even utilizing earlier aggadic formulations. One didactic formula employed in the Tiqqunim is the early rabbinic"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"12 The Enlightened Will Shine exegetical form ein ... ella, \"there is none but,\" meaning \"this can mean only.\" In this way, a phrase such as ein imo ella Keneset Yisrakel, which means \"his mother can only mean the Community of Israel,\" goes from being a literal definition of meaning to a quotation from a lost lexicon of kabbalistic sym-bols.33 This formula is employed from time to time by the author in reference to a preexistent code for his kinnuyim, kabbalistic metaphors and symbols, as in \"his father means only the Blessed Holy One. \"34 Sometimes rabbinic exegetical equations may be adopted, such as \"pegi'ah (meeting) is piyusa (mollification).\"35 Sometimes a specific kinnui will have only one meaning.36 One image may be linked with another in a seamless, flowing free association, as in \"isha (woman) is bayit (house) is a raza de-lfokhmata (a secret ofwisdom).\"37 Tiqqunei ha-Zohar and Ra'aya Meheimna employ a number of traditional Jewish principles of exegetical causality and eso-teric meaning, including gematriyah (numerical coefficient), notarikon (acronym), and temurah (permutation). These meth-ods are rife in the works of Abraham Abulafia and especially in the philosophical Kabbalah of Joseph Gikatilla's Ginnat Egoz, itself an important source for the author's linguistic formula-tions. Numerical associations are also commonly adduced, as in \"All sevens are from the realm of Shekhinah\"38 or \"Seven sefirot, containing seven names.\"39 Punning is also an aspect of this associative play, as in \"Four (revi'i) facets, which is ima revi'a 'aleihem (literally the mother nests on them).\"4o Some-times the associative flow becomes almost impenetrable, as in \"YHHV is a korban 'oleh ve-yored (a sliding scale sacrifice), which is [ma 'I/aah (the Transcendent Mother).\"41 In the Tiqqunim, these textual minutiae are symbolized, combined, and associ-ated to create what is often a very dense and impenetrable text: There is no knowledge like the knowledge of the vowels and cantillation.

The three letters Yud are arranged in such a way as to make of the vowel and cantillation point sega/ta. They also symbolize the emanative continuum of the sefirotic tree, the sefirot ljakhmah, ljesed, and Ne?flQ, on the right side, and Binah, Gevurah, and Hod, on the left side. The narrative structure and meaning of sCripture, as well as the semiotic consideration of any of its components, was the source of the contemplative reading that formed the basis of kabbalistic practice. The holiness of the canonical text was always considered as extending into its most inner minutiae. Kinnui Kinnui, or \"euphemism,\" Originates as a rabbinic legal device, as a term that may be substituted for the name of God as the object of an oath and to prevent inadvertent blasphemy dur-ing testimony.44 The use of this term is largely absent from the sections of the Zohar linked to Moshe de Leon.45 In Tiqqunei ha-Zahar and Ra'aya Meheimna, it is the author's central term for symbol or metaphor. The term kinnui had an enduring function in Jewish philo-sophical literature, particularly at the hands of the Tibbonide translators, who coined much of medieval Hebrew philosophi-cal terminology.46 In every case, it seems to be used as to mean euphemism, as in this instance in Maimonides' Guide far the Perplexed;47 \"All speech that is related to the (Divine) Name may be either a euphemism (kinnui) for (Divine) will and desire or a euphemism for that which the name signifies.\" In the same way, in Judah ha-Levi's Kuzari,48 the term kinnui refers to a situation in which a Hebraism comes to inter-cede for a Greek philsopical term, as in \"perhaps the waters of"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"14 The Enlightened Will Shine the act of creation were merely a euphemism (kinnui) for the hiele.\" At the hands of the Tibbonide translators of these philo-sophical works, a kinnui was not a mere translation, but a euphemism that in some way cloaked the original meaning of a term. Ronald Kiener has noted the presence of this understand-ing of kinnui in his research on the famous Hebrew paraphrase of Sa' adiah Gaon's Book of Beliefs and Opinions. This work had an inestimable effect on the developmentof Jewish spirituality in the Middle Ages. As has been noted by Kiener, this remark of the paraphrase to Sa' adiah seems to presage the positions of Joseph Gikatilla and the author of the Tiqqunim:49 \"The distinc-tion between the specific names and the euphemistic names is that (the former), such as YH, AHYH, ELOHIM, have no oppo-site. The kinuyim, however, have an opposite such as RaIJum (merciful) and its oposite would be Kanu (jealous) ... \" According to the paraphrase of Sa' adiah, the names that have no overt significance are inneffable names, whereas the kinnuyim may signify other images. In subsequent Kabbalah, this first catagory of names were called Hawayin, in apposition to the kinnuyim. A widely known employment of this term is in Joseph Gikatilla's Sha'arei Orah, where the various names of God are understood as kinnuyim for the name YHVH: (God's) Holy Names mentioned in the Torah are all contin-gent on the name YHVH. And if you say \"Isn't the name AHYH the root and the source?\" know that the four-letter name is like the trunk of a tree and the name AHYH is the root of this tree. It takes root there and branches out to all sides. The rest of the Holy Names are like branches and shoots, proceeding out from the trunk, and each of the branches makes fruit according to its species (Gen. 1:11). Besides the Holy Name that may not be erased, there are a number of other kinnuyim contingent on every name. What are the kinnuyim of YHVH? \"Full-of-Awe\" (nora), tolerant of iniquity (nose 'avon), passing over sin (over 'al pesha'). What are the kinnuyim of EL? \"Great\" (gadol) \"Compassionate\" (ral)um) \"Gracious\" (IJanun). Kinnuyim of ELOHIM? \"Grand\" (adir) \"Judge\" (shofet) \"Magistrate\" (dayan). All these kinnuyim are other kinnuyim,"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The Hermeneutics of Theosophical Kabbalah 15 contingent on every kinnui of these, and they are all the other words of the Torah, till we find that the whole Torah is woven of kinnuyim and kinnuyim of names, and the holy names are all contingent on the name YHVH; they all unite with it, so that one finds that the whole Torah is woven on the name YHVH, so that it is called (Psalms 19:8) The Torah, wholly of YHVH. One must understand the intention of the Holy Names and grasp the specific kinnuyim for each of them, trying to cleave to Him, to be in awe and fear of Him, then you will understand the awe of God, and you will find the knowledge of Him ... 50 YHVH is the essential name of God, and all of the others have the status of kinnuyim. The kinnuyim refer to attributes of God, aspects in addition to God's essential nature. The idea of the kinnui, therefore, is an extension of NaJ:nnanides's under-standing of the Torah as the names of God, together with the philosophical idea of God being known through the intermedi-ary of the Divine attributes.51 The author of the Tiqqunim was influenced by Gikatilla's use of the kinnui. Certainly, it is the most widely employed literary device in the Tiqqunim and Ra'aya Meheima. In the introduction to the Tiqqunei ha-Zohar, the kinnuyim are portrayed as independent entities: \"the Most Tran-scendent permitted all the holy names and beings and all the kinnuyim to reveal their hidden secrets to [the adepts], every name on its own level, and the ten sefirot were permitted to reveal to them hidden secrets that will not be permitted to be revealed until the generation when the Messiah comes.\"52 The kinnuyim, like the names of God and the sefirot them-selves, are aspects of God's incarnate presence. God permits the kinnuyim to come down and reveal themselves, as if the kinnuyim have an independent existence apart from God's will and na-ture. Just as the sefirot are a vessel for the immanence of God, their kinnuyim are also vessels for multiplicity of expression. Hawayin are all the permutations of the name YHVH, and the kinnuyim comprise the remaining symbols and names of God, including ELOHIM,53 one of the most common biblical appel-lations for God. This idea is supported by the system of numeri-cal causality, gematriya. According to this system, ELOHIM and"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"16 The Enlightened Will Shine kinnui are equated through their shared numerical value of eighty-six. Kinnui signifies a degree of Divinity equivalent to the term ELOHIM, the \"God\" of subsequent English transla-tion: They sanctify God's name above, among the spirits of the other peoples, and every spirit is known by his kinnui, but Israel are known above, by the name YHVH that is the life of all kinnuyim and every name and kinnui witnesses to it. EL witnesses it for it is greater than any people, as in (Job 5:8) I would resort to EL. ELOHIM witnesses on it because He is ELOHAY HA-ELOHIM, as ADNY because of ADO NAY HA-ADONIM.54 The author's free interpretations of biblical texts were man-dated and justified through the medium of the kinnuyim. The kinnui, a product of philosophy and theosophical Kabbalah, was elevated to the importance of the ancient tradition of God's primordial names. As in Sha'arei Orah, the formulation of the kinnui in Tiqqunei ha-Zohar also seems indebted to medieval speculations regard-ing the attributes of God. In the Ra'aya Meheimna, there is this explanation of the theological function of the kinnui: One must know that He is called \"Wise,\" with all kinds of wisdom, \"Understanding,\" with all kinds of understanding, \"Saintly,\" with all kinds of saintliness, \"Heroic,\" with all kinds of heroism, \"Counsel,\" with all kinds of counsel, \"Righteous,\" with all kinds of righteousness, and \"King,\" with all kinds of royalty, until infinity. In all these levels, in one He will be called \"Compassionate,\" and in one He will be called \"Judge,\" and so forth on a number of levels until infinity. Certainly there is a distinction between \"Compassionate\" and \"Judge\"! Before the world was created, however, He was known by those qualities that had yet to exist, for if there was no world, how could He be the Compassionate Judge?! His qualities were potential. Therefore, all names are His kinnuyim because of His actions. He therefore created the soul in His image, to be known through its functions, so that every limb of the body is called a microcosm. The Master of the World does"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The Hermeneutics of Theosophical Kabbalah 17 this with every creature and in every generation according to its acts. The soul is defined according to the actions of its limbs. A limb that fulfills a commandment causes the soul to be called \"compassion,\" \"kindness,\" \"grace,\" and \"mercy,\" while that limb that commits a transgression, its soul is known as \"anger,\" \"judgment,\" and \"rage.\" It is known apart from the body for its compassion or cruelty. Therefore, the Master of the World created the World and its phenomena. Be they compassionate, or gracious, or judging, His names are kinnuyim. He is not called by them, rather every name is a creation of this world. Therefore, when a generation is good, they know Him as YHVH, with the quality of compassion, and when they are sinful, they call Him ADNYsS with the quality of judgment, according to every generation and indi-vidual, but not that He has any particular quality or per-sonal name.S6 The multiplicity of the sefirot, and their kinnuyim, describe God's function in the Universe. They do not, however, attempt to describe the unchanging essence that lies at the core of the Divine, at the very height of the sefirotic tree. The kinnuyim are a formal application of the medieval theological principle of God's attributes. The sefirotic extensions of the Divine are com-pared to the limbs of the body. The actions of each describe and often determine the inner nature of the individual. In a formulation similar to Gikatilla's, the name YHVH remains hidden, its corporeal representation transformed by humankind's sinful state. The emanation and interplay of the sefirot is described by the kinnuyim: Each sefirah has a personal name and quality and limit and realm. The Master of the World extends through these names, dominates them, is called by them, dwells in them, as the soul dwells in the limbs of the body. As the Master of the World has no personal name, or specific place, but every place is His realm, so the soul has no personal name or place in the body, rather the whole body is its realm, there is no limb empty of it. Therefore, one cannot contain the soul in one place, for then it would be absent in other jurisdictions, nor may one call it by one, two, or three names, to say that it"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"18 The Enlightened Will Shine is only ljokhmah, or Binah, or Da'at, but not more, for that would deny its other aspects. How much more so with the Master of the World, that one must not fix Him in anyone place, to call Him by His names ... 57 The Jewish philosophical tradition traditionally prized the notion of God's abstraction and ineffability. Symbolization pro-vided a way to express ideas that defied expression in ordinary language. The philosophical doctrine of God's attributes being the closest one may come to the knowledge of God underlay the function of the kinnuyim. The attributes of the one God could be multiple, as they were understood as attributes, not the essence of God's unity. Hence, the functions of the sefirot could be symbolized in innumerable ways, with the kinnuyim being the medium for this expression. In the words of the great systematizer of Zoharic Kabbalah, R. Moshe Cordovero: \"The sefirot represent various aspects, issues and realities. Every as-pect has a name and kinnui so that one kinnui teaches what another might not.58 The kinnui signifies the hidden Divinity in the profane world. The oneness of God remains hidden, with the kinnuyim representing the function of the Divine in present reality: \"for all the kinnuyim and all the Havayim59 are kinnuyim for Him and He is not a kinnui.\"60 Kinnuyim, in the Maimonidean expression, refer to God's actions, not God's ineffable essence. There is a profusion of symbols to represent the divided realm of Malkhut, the sefirah of present existence. This sefirah is the realm of corporeality, the dichotomous realm of the Shekhinah, the feminine aspect of the Divine: \"The transcendent mother has one kinnui that comes out to the sum of ELOHIM, and that kinnui is light and dark-ness.\"61 An important aspect of the author's use of the kinnuyim lies in his egalitarian employment of source material. Besides the characteristic tropes of the Hebrew Bible, the kinnuyim were apt to include images from the aggadah, the homiletics and lore of the Talmud. They also a display a compelling use of halakhic rhetoric and dicta.

This process is portrayed in terms of the halakhic institu-tion of levirate marriage, in which a man was a required to marry his brother's widow. The ambivalent nature of this insti-tution, with its admixture of joy and sorrow, inspired much kabbalistic interpretation: At that time it says of the Shekhinah (Deuteronomy 28:9): ... and he took off his shoe, the shoe of the Blessed Holy One to uphold what it says: [take off your shoe and unify with the] Shekhinah, which is called J:zali?ah, the hillu? ha-na'al [taking off the sandal]. They don't have to unite with the world though levirate marriage as it says (Ruth 4:7): ... so it is in Israel, a man takes off his shoe and gives it to his neighbor. The shoe is the kinnui, \"a locked garden\" to opening the lock as in Sin crouches by the door (Genesis 4:7), the sin passes and the gate is opened.62 In this example, the kabbalistic symbol is the device that obstructs the essence of the Divine. The adept discards the \"shoe\" that has been thrown in the face of the lesser interpreter of the Divine text. Just as levirate marriage is up to the discre-tion of the couple, so the decision to accept the oblique mean-ing or delve into the deeper meaning of the text is up to the reader. The use of the term kinnui in Tiqqunei ha-Zohar is signifi-cant, as it admits a distinction between a symbol and the meaning that it signifies. Kinnui opens the possibilities of kabbalistic creativity to the adept, through its implicit sanction of randomness, multiplicity, and pluralism.63 According to the principles of this symbolic hermeneutic, a multitude of unde-veloped meanings are nascent in the sprawl of the sacred text. The literature of theosophical Kabbalah was altogether concerned with the interaction of such symbols. The author adopted Joseph Gikatilla's self-conscious use of the kinnui and made it the central literary methodology of the Tiqqun form. The use of the kinnui is important for at least two reasons. First of all, the Tiqqunim themselves are literally structured in a"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"20 The Enlightened Will Shine profusion of kinnuyim linked together.

The Tiqqunim seem to have been composed to convey the mystic's inner state. In so doing, the mystic struggles to part the curtain of symbols to peer, fleetingly, into the essence of the Divine. The mystic follows the path of the associative flow of the kinnuyim, as they circle and overlay the hidden essence of reality. The symbols of any mystical or religious tradition evoke the nature of its religious vision and are necessarily infused with elements of mystery and awe.

The maskilim are an order of mendicant kabbalists, whose charter is the lohar.l The image of a mysti-cal fellowship, whose members wandered the districts of the Galilee, sharing their contemplative visions, had already been portrayed in the lohar. Tiqqunei ha-Zohar and Ra'aya Meheimna formalized this role, particularly in terms of the mystic's rela-tionship to society, social authority, and the cosmic order. The main practice of this mystical order was the contem-plation of the Torah in kabbalistic terms. This kind of reading, which derived from the literary nature of rabbinic midrash, was the characteristic literary feature of the lohar and its re-lated literature. In its chartering of a movement devoted to the practice of symbolic reading, the maskilim of Tiqqunei ha-Zohar represent the apex and closure of the theosophical Kabbalah, in that the text of the lohar became canonical, although the creation of new texts of this nature was sanctioned. The terms maskil and zohar derive from the verse in DanieF liThe enlightened (maskilim) will be radiant (yazhiru) like the bright expanse of the sky, and those who lead the many to righteousness will be like the stars forever and ever.\" This phrase is a staple of loharic imagery, as the term will be radiant is built on the verb ZHR, the basis of the word zohar. This text forms the basis for the introductory proem of Tiqqunei ha-Zohar, and a number of lesser treatments of the text occur in the Tiqqunei Zohar Ifadash.3 The main sections of the lohar generally inter-preted this text in terms of the dynamics of the emanatory process, particularly the conjunction of the lower sefirot: Yesod and Malkhut.4 The brightness or shining of the maskilim, ac-cording to the broadest interpretation of the text, is the hypos-tatic emanation of Divinity into corporeality through the me-dium of these sefirot. In the Midrash ha-Ne'elam,5 arguably the earliest stratum of the lohar, the image zohar signifies the soul's descent into the body.6 Elsewhere, the lohar portrays maskilim as the sup-porting sefirot of the Divine superstructure, \"those who contem-plate with wisdom all that the Palanquin? and her supports require ... for if it didn't shine on them [Le. the maskilim ], they would never be able to perceive it.\"B In this way, the term maskilim represents the emanated aspect of the cosmic order, as"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"The Maskilim: Mystical Vocation in the Tiqqunim 23 well as the mystics who contemplate it. The many portrayals of the maskilim in the Tiqqunim show the mystic using the charged, symbolic reading of the Holy Text as the vehicle for enlighten-ment. To cite one instance: \"Ha-maskilim-These are the ones who look at the secret of wisdom, the inner secrets of the To-rah-the ones who do the will of their master and who practice the Torah day and night.\"9 Through his mystical reading, the maskil becomes a con-duit for the flow of the Divine effluence; he is absorbed into the emanation of reality from the Divine mind.1O This loss of self causes the mystic's consciousness to become a mere instrument for the reception of Divine effluence: \"Ha-maskilim-They prac-tice the Torah and contemplate the words of the Torah with intention and contemplation .... they contemplate, not the word itself, but the place on which that word is contingent. For there is no word that is not contingent on another, higher word. In this word is found the other word, of higher meaning.\"ll The symbolized word of the Torah points to a higher reality. The maskil 's contemplative pietism begins with submis-sion to the law, with the embrace of an obedient faith.12 The self-abnegation required for the acceptance of the \"yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven\" transforms the mystic into a vessel for the outflow of Divine effluence: Maskilim-who contemplate the secret of wisdom, the inner secrets of the Torah, these are the ~addikim who do the will of the Master and practice the Torah day and night, these are the maskilim, knowing the will of the Master best. Have we not learned that there is no level like their level, so that those who practice the Torah are called maskilim, who contemplate with wisdom, with the secret of higher wisdom? The Infinite [Ein Sot] sends out its hidden, unknown light, proceeding from Ein Sof, through the supports, and the maskilim, who know the secret of secrets, contemplate, illuminated by that flowing brightness. Sustaining the secrets of the Torah, they know how to contemplate its hiddenness ... 9 In at least one instance, the Zohar interprets maskilim as a metaphor for the notes of cantillation.14 Tiqqunei ha-Zohar ex-pands this idea to mean that enlightenment descends through"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"24 The Enlightened Will Shine the medium of the cantillation,15 as well as through the let-ters16 and the vowels of the Torah text.

The gnosis of the exegetical moment makes the maskil one with the text and its unfolding of meaning. The maskil aspires to the consciousness of the greatest bib-lical heroes and talmudic sages. The Zohar itself presaged this use of the term maskilim by juxtaposing them with the biblical Patriarchs themselves: \"Did the Patriarchs not know? Rather, the maskilim, who are these? The wise, who themselves contem-plate things that people cannot say with their mouths,18 these are called maskilim.\"19 Tiqqunei ha-Zohar repeatedly equates the maskil's dreams and visions with prophecy.20 The prophecy attainable through symbolic reading is nothing but the direct apprehension of the immanence of God: \"When the Blessed Holy One draws forth prophecy, all the sefirot are unified. \"21 Prophecy exists, in potentia, in the nature of the symbolic text. 22 The maskil's quest for gnosis conforms to the classical rabbinical typologies of prophetic ex-perience. The highest level is represented by the lucid speculum of Moses' prophecy.23 The lowest level of perception is the clouded glass, the instrument of the Sitra AlJra, the demonic force of separation and distension:24 \"He who is adept [maski/] in a mat-ter [davar]25 will attain success (Proverbs 16:20). Davar is the clouded mirror. .. will attain success is the clear mirror. [It is written] adept on a matter and not in a matter, for he must look at that which is above, the shining firmament (zohar ha-raqi'a). From that firmament he could glimpse the shining that shines from the primordial point, that shines and flashes with other lights.\"26 The mystic's intellect is the agency of the mystical ascent and union, not his theurgic practices or meditative techniques. The spiritual claims of this contemplative spirituality were later defined by R. Moshe Cordovero in the following terms: \"it is a functional spirituality, which facilitates vision.

In everything something is reflected ... from the realms which lie in the center of it. Everything is transparent, and in this state of transparency everything takes on a symbolic character. This means that everything, beyond its own mean-ing, has something more, something which is part of that which shines into it or, as if in some devious way, that which has left its mark behind in it, forever ... 29 In sefirotic terms, the maskil's enlightenment comes as a result of the linking of the sefirah of Binah, the receptacle for the more ineffable sefirot, with the corporeal realm of Shekhinah,30 through the realms of Malkhut 31 and Tiferet.32 Shekhinah is a metaphor for the nature of the transcendent and the ineffable as well as the vicissitudes of the soul in the body.33 Enlighten-ment comes about through the classical erotic metaphor of hieros gamos employed so widely in the theosophical Kabbalah. In the words of the Tiqqunim: liThe maskilim have the wisdom to know the daughter's ascent in prayer, through the letters, vowels, and cantillation, to raise love and peace and union and intimacy between them through their qualities, to unify them as one34 ... Masters of Torah, from the realm of the cen-tral pillar, in which at midnight King David arose35 to unite with the Shekhinah (who is night)\" ... 36 As intercessors between the text and its esoteric meaning, the maskilim are like shadkhanim, or matchmakers, brokering the union of the adherent with the Divine. The Tiqqunim and Zohar both employ various images of intercession in their por-trayal of the maskilim.

These works are among the first exegeses of the lohar and also form the basis for subsequent lohar commentaries. According to the author's understanding, the maskil was guided by the lohar and also committed to the expansion and exegesis of that vast work. The maskilim are often juxtaposed with the author's in-vocation of lohar as the charter of his contemporary mystical vocation: \"The maskilim understand from the realm of Binah, the Tree of Life, through your composition that is the Sefer ha-Zohar, from the shining of the higher mother, which is repen-tance, for in the future Israel will taste from this Tree of Life that is this book Zohar.\"37 The Israeli historian Yi~l}.ak Baer was interested in tracing the relationship between the author of the Ra'aya Meheimna and Christian pietistic circles in Castile. Baer saw the author's use of the lohar as similar to Christian pietist's use of manuals of behavior in their orders. \"It is as if the lohar is thought of as a book of daily practice (or even as an actual book of de-crees)-a kind of covenantal book for a circle of initiates, func-tioning, like the Franciscans, and receiving into their circle others who are prepared to assume their ascetic stringencies, or at least to keep the commandments of the Torah.\"38 In making this comparison, Baer erred in his portrayal of the loharic literature. The lohar could hardly be an efficient manual of practice, because of the extended novel form that characterizes much of its composition. Only certain parts of the lohar-for instance, the sections called Piqqudim and Matnitin-adhere to the format of sitrei mi~vot or \"books of command-ments.\" The Ra'aya Meheimna, with its emphasis on the Temple cult, is hardly a manual of discipline for a medieval author. It is more plausible to assume that the lohar was understood as a sacred text for the purposes of the adept's mystical contem-plation.

The Zohar intercedes between the angels above and the mystical scholars below: The maskilim are the 600,000 Masters of the Mishnah above. There are 600,00 Masters of the Mishnah below; these are the 600,000 angels and these 600,000 stars shine as it says:40 Moses' face was like the face of the Sun. They will shine in its words, they will all shine in its writing in this book, Like the shining of the firmament, in whose name it is called the book Zohar (shining), in the image of the inner pillar that is Sefer (book).

This is the Zohar that shines in the heart of the Faithful Shepherd, the brightness42 of the thirty-two in-stances of ELOHIM in the act of creation.43 Tiqqunei ha-Zohar saw the Zohar itself, like the Torah, as consisting of fragmented letters, each with a higher secret.44 The Zohar itself was seen as having the numinosity of any other sacred text in the biblical and rabbinic canon. This un-derstanding helped to expedite the Zohar's own passage into canonic status and its incorporation into the liturgy. When the Tiqqunim and Ra'aya Meheimna were published with the printed texts of the Zohar, they became part of the Zoharic canon and, by association, the Jewish canon. The Zohar literature, as a whole, came to self-consciously portray its own sacredness, cre-ating a kind of historical closure to the classical period of theo-sophical Kabbalah. Piety and Poverty The essential behavior and conduct of the maskil follow the contours of the most classical acts of Jewish piety. The esoteric dimension of this piety is built on classic rabbinic val-"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"28 The Enlightened Will Shine ues of humility and self-abnegation, to the point of immola-tion.45 This piety also draws on the rabbinic understanding of the nature of Torah study. In the lohar and Tiqqunim, study is seen as an ascent to the realm of Divine thought,46 The lohar naturally used the classical typologies of Jewish piety, as it claimed to depict the spiritual life of the tannaim. Tiqqunei ha-Zohar and Ra'aya Meheima continued the use of these typologies in the portrayal of the maskilY The lohar understands the religiOUS saint, or {addik, as God's intermediary. The {addik intercedes between God and humankind. The {addik's leadership redeems the people, and he or she feels the people's pain acutely. The {addik's interces-sion is not through the monistic manipulation of impersonal forces. The {addik is, rather, a third party and buffer in the dynamics of the personal relationship between God and the people Israel. 48 An important literary motif in the lohar is that of the elevation of the SOcietally marginal. Commonly, a member of some humble stratum of society is revealed as a secret pur-veyor of hidden wisdom hiding the magnitude of his or her spirituality. Enlightenment is apt to come from an infant, a donkey driver, or an apparently addled old man. This literary motif carries explicit criticism of the frequent obtuseness of rabbinic authority. It is common for the lohar to portray the figure of the pauper, who \"has nothing of his own,\"49 as sym-bolic of Malkhut, the sefirah of present existence, which is merely a receptacle for the influxes of the other sefirot.50 It is clear that, based on the foundation laid by the lohar, the maskil requires no societal approbation. The potential of this nascent literary motif is realized in the Ra'aya Meheimna and Tiqqunim, which speak of the spiri-tual value of poverty and self-abnegation for the sake of the Torah.51 Tiqqunei ha-Zohar and Ra'aya Meheimna see this value as latent in a number of rabbinic dicta, such as There is no poverty besides that of Torah 52 and You shall love the Lord with all your soul, even if he takes your soul, 53 and Poverty is a kind of death.54 The travail of poverty is \"like the seven fires of Geihinnom,\"55 but, nonetheless, the mystic \"gives God what he loves best.\"56"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"The Maskilim: Mystical Vocation in the Tiqqunim 29 Poverty is not an ideal state, but is, rather, the fault of society. Ra'aya Meheimna, in particular, expresses dissatisfac-tion with societal and religious values. The author is scornful of those burghers who are reluctant to support the mendicant scholars of the community: \"The miser and his money are disgraceful! Because he doesn't contribute, he is not from the seed of the patriarchs ... because he does not benefit the mas-ters of the Torah, by supporting them.\"57 Yi.~q.ak Baer and Isaiah Tishby disputed whether poverty is a necessary part of Ra'aya Meheimna's mystical system. It was Baer's contention58 that poverty was a goal and religious value. Baer thought that this implied a positive value in suffering and considered this to be another indication of the author's contact with Joachide pietism, which valued poverty and renunciation. According to Baer: \"Our cabalist author lists poverty as one of the characteristics of Messianic times. It is not, as the Talmud sees it, one of the final tribulations of Messianic travail, but rather a religious end in itself. Poverty is a means of sanctifica-tion voluntarily assumed. It is a becoming trait, not only of the people to-be-redeemed and of its redeemer, but of the Divinity itself. Here is a case of a tradition turning Dogma.\"59 Contradicting this view, Isaiah Tishbro pointed out that the main sections of the Zohar generally extol the virtues of the poor alongside of the virtue of charity, albeit from a posi-tion of noblesse oblige. According to Tishby, the author of the Tiqqunim accepts the suffering of the poor ~addik but does not make a specific, desirable virtue of poverty. The mystic's be-nighted state is as perverse and unfair as the benighted state of the people Israel. According to Tishby: \"The poor Shekhinah and Moses don't glorify their poverty, rather they complain of their suffering and degradation.\"61 Persuasively, he argues that \"this is not a tradition of holy poverty, only of holy paupers.\"62 Certainly, Baer's argument for a Judaic \"vow of poverty\" would support his thesis that there was considerable contact between theosophical kabbalists and the Franciscan and Joachide pi-etists of Castile. Tishby's understanding seems the more plau-sible: that poverty is a condition that may accompany the mystics's condition, but is not necessarily an inevitable precon-dition for mystical practice."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"30 The Enlightened Will Shine The most recent published remarks on this issue are also the most definitive. A contemporary authority on the Tiqqunim and Ra'aya Meheimna, Amos Goldreich,63 has written: This sharp motif is perhaps the acme of the theological struc-tures of the Tiqqunei ha-Zohar literature that deal with the sources of poverty, which churned in the depths of the author's soul: classes of wealthy, powerful, and parsimonious Jews, at whose hand our author suffered no little bit. This can only be the personal fate of the author, drawn into a metahistorical vision, whose roots are based in the conflict between the Divine and demonic forces. As opposed to the Zohar, which has so much vital interest in the demonic and its array of forces (apparently from the traditions of the Castilean kabbalists, as well as the author's own tendencies toward the realm of myth), the author of Tiqqunei ha-Zohar was not so interested in metaphYSical evil, but rather in its concrete his-torical and societal manifestations. Goldreich's distinction between the preoccupations of the Zohar and the Tiqqunim is particularly apt. In sefirotic terms, the Ra'aya Meheimna's main interest is with Malkhut, the sefirah of present existence. For instance, the Zohar often presents the Messiah, a paradigm of Malkhut, as a pauper. This understand-ing provides an opportunity for the author to equate poverty with the presence of the sefirah of Malkhut. The mystic's suffer-ing also derives from his heightened identification with the suffering of the Shekhinah, the other great paradigm of Malkhut. Metatron, the demiurgic angel, is portrayed bewailing the lot of the righteous: \"Wherever the sages cast their eyes there is ei-ther poverty or death. These are the maidens who die young, all of them are under my jurisdiction in the celestial academy. Why is this? Because the Shekhinah is among them ... \"64 The depth of the author's preoccupation with the phe-nomenon of poverty is reflected in his symbolic interpretation of rabbinic ethical dicta. The Mishnah's well-known injunc-tion, \"He who uses the crown will depart\" (de-ishtammash be-taga l]alaf),65 relates particularly to the dilemma of the poor adept. According to kabbalistic metaphysics, the aspects of"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"The Maskilim: Mystical Vocation in the Tiqqunim 31 Shekhinah in all the sefirot come from Keter, the crown (Aramaic, taga), but this aspect is transformed (I)Qlaf) in the process of immanence.66 The delicate crowns on the Torah text indicate the Torah's origins in the ineffable, as they are made up of the faintest possible markings on the scroll's parchment.67 Using the \"crown\" profanes the delicate interaction between Malkhut and Yesod and throws the transformative moment into the realm of the demonic qelippot.68 This is really a kind of double metaphor, as the crown may also be the crown of the sefirah Yesod, at the apex of Malkhut. The sexual connotation of the term ish tam mash reinforces the Zohar's erotic metaphor for mystical union.69 A further understanding of de-ish tam mash be-taga I]alaf derives from a talmudic reinterpretation associated with R. Shimon ben Lakish,7o in which the illicit use of the crown refers to the act of passing the secrets to one who is not worthy71 or deriving gain from teaching the Law.72 The mystic's merit, ac-crued through his pietistic practice, is not for his own benefit. These energies are reserved for the needs of the community; selfish use of them is compared to using the property of or-phans.73 The Torah is the instrument of redemption,74 but its practitioners immolate themselves through their practice. There-fore \"there is no real poverty except of Torah,\"75 and the mystic is counseled to remain stoic in the face of his suffering. Similarly, the injunction against practicing the mi~vot al menat le-qabel peras, that is, \"for the sake of a reward,\"76 has a metaphysical dimension. The act of claiming a reward is a mark of enslavement to the demonic.77 It is therefore a be-trayal of the adept's royal birthright: his relationship to the Messiah.78 The most appropriate model of humility is that of a child honoring his or her parents.79 The mendicant pietist's lot is the alienation of exile: wan-dering and rootlessness.8o This dynamism of change is expressed through various halakhic actions of change: changing one's name, one's location, and on the Sabbath, one's actions. This restlessness is also evoked by the author's use of biblical literary motifs. The patriarchs of Genesis or the dove of the flood accountBl are exemplars of the redemptive nature of wander-ing and rootlessness."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"32 The Enlightened Will Shine The maskil's life-style is painful.

This ideal will be found to be all pervasive in that writer's thought system. Thus, the messi-anic period will be viewed as a restoration of Adam's condition before the Fall, and for the period between the beginning and the End-the here and now-a program will be conceived to retrieve the lost ideal. At a minimum, such a scheme provides a helpful perspective on a writer. At best, it may provide the key to his thought. 1 In the Tiqqunim and RaJaya Meheimna, present existence is suffused with qualities of exile and loss. The maskil under-stands that the world is enmeshed in an ontology of chaos. The mystic's loneliness and alienation result from his heightened sensitivity to this truth. This alienation is expressed in myths of prehistory and exile, derived from the author's selection of mythic aggadot. The Talmud and midrashim are heterogeneous anthologies of multiple sources, culled over a period of several centuries. If they manifest a unifying mentality, it is that of the compiler and final editor. Zoharic texts, on the other hand, resemble late and medieval midrashim in that they are distinguished by 33"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"34 The Enlightened Will Shine the unifying perspective of a single author. In the lohar, the author's voice asserts itself in his selection and interpretation of the midrashic canon. Narratives from the midrash are com-bined and reconstructed into a coherent myth. This recurring myth haunts the kabbalistic author's thinking as he constructs a world-view based on primordial traditions of rabbinic esotericism. These traditions might be remnants of a lost rab-binic esotericism. The utilization of these early legends consti-tutes a particularly \"received\" aspect of the theosophic Kabbalah, in that the term kabbalah means \"received tradition.\" Although Tiqqunei ha-Zohar clearly builds on the lohar's assemblage of source material, the author nevertheless incor-porates aggadic motifs that the lohar omits or does not ex-plore. These motifs are recombined in such a way as to present a unified myth of prehistory and its relation to the present. Humankind's present dilemmas derive from these mythic events. The events of Genesis, then, are not confined to remote history, but continue to unfold in the present. The lohar perceives the dilemmas of humankind as deriv-ing, at least in part, from the consequences of the fall of Adam. The kabbalistic uses of the mythos of the fall reveal the tension between two great extraneous influences: Neoplatonic optimism and gnostic pessimism. Hence, the tradition of Adam as the primordial man probably has its origins in the mysterious rela-tionship between early Kabbalah and Manicheanism, Catharism, and other esoteric traditions that were presumably within the kabbalists' intellectual orbit.2 Both the lohar and the Tiqqunim cite the midrashic tradition that God created a number of prior worlds, and was later compelled to destroy them (boneh 'olamot u-maJ:r;zrivan).3 The present world was created through the emanation of the Divine effluence through the sefirot. The tensions and rivalries of those previous worlds con-tinue into contemporary history. Biblical figures confront one another again, renewed through the principle of gUgul or trans-migration, particularly among the Edenic generations,4 and the lineages around Moses.5 The fall was important to Tiqqunei ha-Zohar and Ra'aya Meheimna, for it began a chain of catas-trophes that continue to unfold, defining the fallen condition"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"The Myth of Chaos 35 of existence. Focal pOints for the author's portrayal of the fall were its themes of seduction, the power of evil, and the role of the demonic in present existence. Traditions of the seduction and defilement of Eve by the serpent originate in a number of classical Rabbinic sources. One talmudic tradition portrays the serpent as having im-planted zohama (impurity) in Eve.6 This tradition recurs in theo-sophical Kabbalah, particularly in the Bahir/ the Zohar,s and the Tiqqunim.9 In the Tiqqunim, the serpent is a paradigm of deceit,1Â° an agent of the sefirah of Din, harsh judgment.ll The banishment from the Garden of Eden continues into the present, for lithe serpent is the promiscuous woman who destroys the Shekhinah by separating her from her husband.\"12 In sefirotic terms, the tradition of seduction and implantation implies a defilement in the sefirah Malkhut, caused by the illicit union of the serpent and Eve. The implantation of evil in Eve is not only impregnation, it also implies a demonic aspect in womankind, as well as a demonic strain in the primordial geneologies. Hence, present reality is an admixture of good and evil. It is the adept's task to attain the former and overcome or elimi-nate the latter. The fall is depicted as an entrance into the realm of qelippah, the demonic husk that acts as a barrier to the Holy. According to one rabbinic tradition, Adam \"stretched his fore-skin\" and thereby brought sexual transgression into the world.13 The term, \"stretched his foreskin\" (mashakh be-'orlato) origi-nally referred to episplasm, the practice by which Hellenized Jews sought to cover the evidence of their circumcisions. The Zoharl4 and TiqqunimlS understand this expression as a with-drawal into the realm of the demonic qelippah. Subsequent Kabbalah equated the profanation of the covenant with mas-turbation, although not specifically in this case.16 In the words of the Zohar, \"He separated the holy covenant from its place and its portion, truly he stretched his foreskin, discarded the holy covenant, cleaved to his foreskin and was seduced by the word of the serpent.\"I?

For the Good Inclination (ye?Â£r ha-tov) and the Evil Inclination (ye?er ha-ra), which are the good Adam and the evil Adam, the Blessed Holy One provided three com-mandments: idolatry, lewdness and bloodshed ... 18 Before the fall, Adam embodied the good and evil inclina-tions, the impulse to goodness and the impulse to sin. The Evil Inclination is portrayed as an incarnate demonic spirit, and the catastrophe of the fall is the result of this spirit's malevolence: After the Evil Inclination transgressed the commandment of the Blessed Holy One, death was decreed upon him. He said \"what will happen if I die? He will merely take another ser-vant!\" For the Evil Inclination is a servant, and his wife is a maidservant, and his place would be inherited by another servant. What did he do? He and his wife went to seduce Adam and his wife, who were from the realm of goodness. The wife of the Evil Inclination, Lilit, seduced Adam of the Good Inclination, therefore it says: The women that you put at my side, she gave me of the tree ... (Genesis 3:12) And the Evil Inclination seduced Eve, causing them death, so the Blessed Holy One stripped the Good Inclination from Adam's body in the Garden of Eden and the garments of him and his wife, as it says: And they perceived that they were naked (Genesis 3:7) and he expelled them from the Garden, as it says: He drove Adam out (Genesis 3:24) and his mate with him. And he brought them down to the seven lands that are valley, cloud, ruin, land, soil, earth, world.19 He cried out and ascended.20 Nonetheless, he was naked, unclothed, he and his wife.21 The Evil Inclination is a fallen angel, whose tragedy dates from prehistory.

The generations of the patriarchs are an attempt to restore the unsullied nature of Adam before the fall: What did the Blessed Holy One do? He reincarnated him as Abraham, and his wife as Sarah. They brought forth impure progeny, Ishmael, the uncleanliness that the snake implanted in Eve. The Blessed Holy One tempered him in a smelting pot of silver, which was mixed with lead and more lead. When he passed him through the fire, the silver was tempered, whitened, and the residue was taken out, this is the temper-ing of Adam in Abraham. And the impurity was taken out, this is Ishmael, the impurity that the serpent implanted in Eve. And the reincarnation of Eve, Adam's spouse, glowed red in the fire, releasing the impurities and this was Esau, his redness like the blood of slaughter. Since the feminine came through Isaac, the left is called the feminine. Afterward they both emerged in Jacob and his spouse, his seed and his exile is the surrounding pallor. This is, therefore, the meaning of (Job 33:29): All these things has God done twice, thrice with a man ... 22 The initial generations of covenantal history are devoted to an attempt to correct the fallen state of humankind through the refinement of the Jewish nation's genealogical line. At the same time, the nations that surround the people Israel are made up of the residue of the refining process, implying that the gentile nations contain, genetically, traces of the demonic. In pure kabbalistic terms, Adam's sin is understood as taking place in the \"mind\" of the Divine infrastructure, that is, in the first and second sefirot. 23 Such an understanding implies that there is a hierarchical set of values in the sefirotic tree. Defilement at a higher level is more serious because it is more intrinsic, affecting the Divine effluence closer to its source.

As it says: For one high official is protected by a higher one and both of them by still higher ones (Ecclesiastes 5:7) and above all of them is the highest, most hidden thought. How many thoughts are there, clothing one another! Clearly Adam only sinned in the thought that is the garment. As it says:! was afraid because! was naked, so! hid (Genesis 3:10). It says of Adam: ! hid and it says of Moses: Moses hid his face (Exodus 3:6).24 In this text, Rabbi Eliezer, the son of Rabbi Shimon Bar Yogai, confines the scope of the sin to the sefirah Malkhut. He attempts to qualify the scope of the fall by attempting to ob-scure the anthropomorphism of Adam's sinning in the upper sefirot. These sefirot are, bluntly, the \"mind\" of God, being at the head of the anthropos formed by the sefirotic tree. Rabbi Shimon responds by emphasizing the encompassing scope of the sin and the fall, comparing it to Moses' brazenness follow-ing the incident of the golden calf: R. Shimon said, \"My son, Certainly Adam sinned in all of them, in the thought that is the garment and in the inner thought. Therefore, when Moses said: Show me your glory (Exo-dus 33:18), He said: \"For no man shall see me and live\" for if he merits to see Me, he will live forever. Therefore he said to him: You cannot see my face (Exodus 33:20). For there are no countenances here, only unseen countenances. In the place that '!lat ha-'!lot is known, in the place that He is revealed, the sin of Adam caused Moses to be unable to gaze upon Him, let alone another.

Rabbi Shimon's prevailing ar-gument for the accessibility of 'Ilat ha-'Ilot, the most \"potential\" and infinite aspects of God, is a victory of mystical antirationalism over Aristotelean rationalism: R. Eliezer said: \"It is nonetheless clear that he did not sin in the higher thought, rather in that which is the garment, and he remained outside in the intellect without the skull. There-fore I was afraid. He trembled from that which was within the inner thought 'Ilat ha-'Ilot.\" R. Shimon said to him, liMy son, he even sinned in the inner thought, the intellect, from whence comes the seed. It is the flowing of the Tree of Life, the pri-mordial, pure and purified light, three drops of which are implied in the higher Yud, with its upper, lower, and middle hook. He mixed their darkness, which separates 'Ilat ha-'Ilot from the hidden intellect. Therefore, for no man shall see me and live, until that very darkness passes away, the inner mean-ing of Your sins have made him turn his face away and refuse to hear you (Isaiah 59:2). For no thought, or eye, can perceive that darkness, till it passes. It is like the lower clouds, of which it says: Your shelter is in the cloud (Leviticus 3:44). R. Eliezer and all the fellows and elders of the academy trembled and said, \"until now we had not known that the sin was at such a high levell\"27 Adam sins against his own consciousness through his eat-ing the fruit; he sullies the abstract transcendence of 'Ilat ha-'Ilot with the divisions and mundane corporeality of the lower sefirot. This act, in turn, flaws the potential for human percep-tion of the Divine. The action is truly theurgic, as humankind influences the Divine, and validates theurgic kabbalistic re-sponses to the effects of the fall. This understanding remains faithful to the essential meaning of the text in Genesis, in that Adam and Eve attempt to \"become as gods,\" to attain a Divine level of consciousness. In response to this transgression, God withdraws from the first two sefirot, creating a \"garment,\" or obstacle, between the ineffable and its emanation into the corporeal realm.

The World Trees The metaphysical catastrophe of the fall influences history in a number of ways. Tiqqunei ha-Zohar portrays the trees of the Garden of Eden, the E-?

Since the inception of theosophical Kabbalah, these World Trees have been under-stood as representing the realms of the prosaic and the tran-scendent. The Tree of Life represents the union of the six intermedi-ate sefirot. It is an idealized realm of unity, untroubled by the divisions that afflict the lowest sefirah Malkhut. It \"has no diffi-culty from the realm of evil, no dispute from the unclean spirit.\"29 According to the Tiqqunim, mystical teachings are the doctrine of the Tree of Life, whereas halakhah, the legal infrastructure, is the doctrine of the Tree of Knowledge.3D The Tree of Life repre-sents the idealized Torah. Mundane, corporeal existence was manifestly the realm of the Tree of Knowledge; it was the author's expectation that the adept would seek the empower-ment that comes from the Tree of LifeY These ideas are used in many ways to interpret the bibli-cal tradition. Eve's secondary position in her relationship with Adam indicates that she existed only on the level of the Tree of Knowledge.32 HistOrically, the first tablets that Moses received at Sinai came from the Tree of Life, but the subsequent tablets, bestowed after the incident of the golden calf, came from the Tree of Knowledge.33 The Temple service, in particular, invokes the Tree of Life's imagery.

The RaJaya Meheimna and Tiqqunim culled many images of antediluvian chaos from the Bible and the Talmud: the talmudic \"sea of Torah,\"53 the sea trial of the biblical Jonah, and the mysteriously allegorical aggadot about Raba Bar Bar Hanah.54 The flood's chaos is a plague of decrees of the harshest, most immediate judgment, which are like the turbulent sea.55 The spiritual elect, besieged by the forces of corruption take refuge in the ark. The recession of the flood indicates the begin-ning of a messianic age. The ark is the Zohar,56 which provides its beleaguered community with shelter and salvific knowledge in the midst of the present chaos.57 The raven and the dove of the flood account have particu-lar importance in Tiqqueni ha-Zohar and Ra'aya Meheimna. In the original account, of course, the raven perishes in the sea, whereas the dove returns to the ark to signal the eventual passage of the elect to safety. Two movements of Judaism are described, one of which failed in its mission, pulled down by the corrupting needs of an ignorant populace. The failure of the raven, the corrupted rabbinate, leaves the \"dove\" to reveal the redemptive process. The yonah, or dove, represents the Shekhinah, who, like the dove, seeks a resting place, with Jerusalem as her nest.58 The word yonah signifies both the willful prophet Jonah and the dove that is the agent of humanity's redemption.59 The dove is"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"44 The Enlightened Will Shine the trustworthy messenger who archetypally guards her brood with prayers, songs, and praises.60 The dove also represents Moses, who brings the Torah through which Israel is redeemed.61 The political dilemma of Israel is portrayed as that of a dove being pursued by an eagle.62 As Yi~l;1ak Baer has demonstrated, the parable of the dove bears remarkable similarity to a commentary on Jeremiah that originated among followers of the Abbot Joachim of Fiore. The Christian text is pseudepigraphic and apparently dates to 1240 C.L It compares the ark with the besieged ecclesiastic community. The raven represents the dominant sect, whose fate is to be swallowed up by the crisis, whereas the dove represents the Joachide-Franciscans who will emerge to signal the coming redemption. This commentary also portrays a pan-theon of nemeses: Dominican Catholicism, Greek Orthodoxy, the Roman clergy, rationalistic philosophers, and various other corrupting influences. The possibility of contact between the mystical representa-tives of two largely antipathetic religious communities is per-plexing. Baer was of the opinion that these pietists had been brought into \"ideological kinship.\"63 Baer theorized that the author of the Tiqqunim developed an interpretation of the dove, then came in contact with the Joachide account of the raven and incorporated it into his work. In Baer's words: Authors of sermons such as those of the Ra'aya Meheimna and the Tiqqunei ha-Zohar seem like the Jewish brothers of the wandering mendicant brothers, the spiritualized Joachide Franciscans from whom originated the anonymous commen-tary on Jeremiah .... There is no doubt that the Jewish Kabbalist heard or read the [pseudo-Joachim's] words and wanted to make use of them for his purposes, but he did not succeed in this, or perhaps he was not so brazen as to ex-plain his allusions and left them unclear. He was certainly not so brazen as to apply the Messianic term \"Yonah\" to one of his own generation.64 Yi~l;1ak Baer's studies of the Ra'aya Meheimna were directed towards tradng the interaction of the author with Christian pietis-tic drdes in Castile. Evidence such as the parable of the dove and"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"The Myth of Chaos 45 the raven, along with his advocacy of ascetidsm and self-abnega-tion pointed, in Baer's view, to a direct link between the two mystical communities. The methodological flaw in such a di-rected study was the narrow focus of the subject matter. Although there are similarities between these teachings and those of the author's Christian contemporaries, these teaching are not the main preoccupation of the Tiqqunim and Ra'aya Meheimna. The Zohar literature may borrow literary motifs from many sources, includ-ing Christian mystical texts, yet its attitude toward Christianity is savagely negative. In his eagerness to identify links between the author of Ra'aya Meheimna and his Christian contemporaries, Baer gave scant attention to the fact that their shared notions reflect the common values of piOUS ascetics in every culture. Isaiah Tishby theorized that the raven represents a veiled critique of Moses de Leon, who was said to have profitted finandally from the philanthropists who financed the \"tran-scription\" of the Zohar.65 The reverence that the author directs toward the Zohar as a sacred text, however, would seem to belie such a sentiment. If the Zohar was really produced by a wider drcle of initiates, then perhaps author of the Tiqqunim could revere the work as a whole while expressing disappoint-ment in its prindple contributor. The allusions to Moses' fall seem, most likely, to reflect the stormy interaction of mystical and halakhic communities. The drama of the Day of Atonement is also symbolized by the events of the flood. In this metaphoric scheme, the flood signifies the events of the coming year and repentance is the soteric agency, saving the adherent from annihilation.66 The predominance of this literary motif caused Tiqqunei ha-Zohar to be identified liturgically with the season of penitence from the month of Elul through the Day of Atonement. Many editions are divided in such a way as to guide the pious reader through a redtation of the whole Tiqqunei ha-Zohar during that forty-day period.67 Clearly, the flood was popularly perceived as an important and characteristic motif in the Tiqqunim. These interpretations present the flood as a recurring myth of renewal. The symbols and metaphors of the story provide a rationale for the sodal upheavals and arbitrary tragedies of the author's time."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"46 The Enlightened Will Shine The Incarnate Demonic The historical catastrophes that attended the creation, the flood, and the exodus continue in the machinations of demonic. The author of the Zohar and the author of the Tiqqunim shared a very great dread of this incarnate demonic spirit. Such a notion of an independent realm of evil is close to dualistic heresy, a violation of classical Jewish theism. As such, these kabbalistic traditions bal-ance various contradictory understandings of the demonic. As has been stated, kabbalistic thought wavered between the poles of Neoplatonic optimism and gnostic pessimism.68 The former is a monistic understanding of a world nourished and sustained by the outpourings of Divine effluence. The lat-ter posits a barrier between the mystic, mired in the banality and pain of present reality, and the sublime Divinity, in its own abode, forever elsewhere. A gnostic rupture in the Divine effluence may come about through the blocking effect of the qelippot. This catastrope creates a voided, demonic context. Simi-larly, in the Neoplatonic understanding, linear distance be-tween the acme of the Godhead and the lowest hypostasis of the sefirot creates an alienation that provides a context for evi1.69 Both doctrines of evil exist in potencia, and both possibili-ties were incorporated into early kabbalistic systems. The Zohar contains two understandings70 of the origin of the demonic. One is a mythological, cathartic view of evil as Divine waste, and the other is a philosophical, emanative view, positing evil as part of linear distance from the acme of the Godhead. Both hold that evil emanates from the demonic that has its root in the left side of the Divine. Such understandings of evil preoccupied the early kabbalists of Provence and Gerona.71 This view is reflected in the views of the Castilian practitioners of \"gnostic Kabbalah,\" the brothers Jacob and Isaac Cohen and Todros Abulafia (himself an important influence on Moshe de Leon). The Cohen brothers seem to have been influenced by the Catha rite gnostics of Languedoc, through the intermediary of the Provencal kabbalists.lZIn R. Isaac Cohen's scheme, the demonic originated in the sefirah Binah, the principle of Divine understanding in the upper triad of the sefirotic tree. R.

In each situa-tion, the kabbalist's see evil as nascent in the Divine structure. In the Zohar's emanative scheme, the demonic realm is com-monly portrayed as a mirror image of the Divine sefirotic tree, though its power and scope are but a \"dry shadow\" of the holy emanation, \"like a monkey to a person. \"73 These mirror im-ages of the sefirotic structure derive from the realm of tum'ah (impurity) and are called, variously, the \"crowns of sorcery\" or the \"ten weapons of sorcery and witchcraft.\"74 The Zohar's second understanding portrays evil as origi-nating in the residue of Din, which is produced in the same way that the human body produces impurity and waste5 Sym-bolically, these forces of evil and impurity also originate in the dregs of the primordial chaos, tohu va-vohu/6 The demonic may be incarnate in various ways.

In the persons of the mashQit (destroyer) and the Angel of Death, it embodies destruction and death. In the persona of the horned Samael and his mates, it governs the demonic and personifies sexual transgression. There are evil spirits that take charge of various times and periods,77 and demonic entities that command inde-pendent conceptual realms, such as that of falsehood/8 The processes of the demonic, particularly in its incarnation as the evil inclination, are \"as inexorable as leaven in dough.\"79 The demonic is also manifested in specifically masculine and feminine aspects. This male aspect is called king of the gentilesBo and presides over a court of minor demons who serve him.81 Lilit, the archetypal devouring goddess of crib death and nocturnal emission, is a palpable presence in Tiqqunei ha-Zohar's demonology.82 She is the incarnate product of incest and misce-genation, 'ervat ishshah u-vitah,83 the \"shadow\" of the Shekhinah, who governs the realms of sin and despair.84 In sefirotic terms, Samael and Lilit are justaposed to the sefirot Tiferet and Malkhut.

Demonic elements include the 'ammei ha-are{, \"people of the land\" or ignoramuses, and the 'erev rav or \"mixed multi-tude\" of the Exodus account. The 'erev rav are at least partially responsible for society's degeneracy. These progeny of Lilit 97 are inherently flawed or inferior members of the Jewish community. According to the metaphor of the Tiqqunim, the 'erev rav have the worth, to society, of fertilizer decaying in a garden: \"This is the realm of the mixed multitude: garbage is mixed in the garden, to grow seeds from the realm of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, from the realm of idolatry that is called Saturn, Lilit.

These five races, primordial enemies of Israel, are Judaism's contempo-rary nemeses. To the pietistic author, each of these five groups represents one aspect of social malaise.

Nefilim, the fallen angels (ct. Genesis 6:4), have allowed philosophy and heresies to corrupt their belief and thus fell from their spiritual plane. Gibborim, the biblical \"men of re-nown\" are characterized by their social self-aggrandizement. In Yi~l)ak Baer's opinion, these are the court Jews with their intrigues. Refaim, in a play on the Hebrew rofef, \"soften,\" are those who \"soften\" their religious observance to assimilate.104 The anaqim, \"giants,\" are the wealthy, who are miserly with their support of the mendicant scholars. 105 A subtext in the presentation of these typologies is Kabbalah's ongoing polemic against the corrosive influence of philosophical rationalism on the observance of the commandments. The bor or \"ignoramus\" is another agent of the demonic. This is understood as a multivalenced term, meaning either \"pit\" or, roughly, \"boor.\" Tiqqunei ha-Zohar explores this multivalence, quoting the talmudic dictum Ein bor yere IJet (the bor cannot be in fear of sin)yl6 Bor signifies, as well, the pit into which Joseph was thrown by his brothers.107 According to a well-known midrash, lOS the pit was full of snakes and scorpi-ons, which are interpreted as \"famine, thirst, weeping, fasting, and darkness. \"109 One's social caste is intrinsic, deriving from the state of the practitioner's soul: There is a soul that is like a slave, as it says: When a man sells his daughter as a slave (Exodus 21:7).

And there are those who rut like animals; the Masters of the Mishnah taught that they are like reptiles, their daughters are like vermin, of whom it says: Cursed be he who lies with any beast (Deuteronomy 27:21).

The Messiah who haunts the Tiqqunim and RaJaya Meheimna is suffering and destitute, pursued by preda-tors and abused by the rich. His nature is aptly portrayed by the suffering servant of the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah, lan-guishing, imprisoned by the forces of evil.1!7 This suffering Mes-siah is distinct from the heroic Davidic paradigm. Each of the traditional images of the Messiah is necessary, as the two Mes-siahs represent two sefirotic aspects of the redemption: \"In the last redemption, [God] will send two Messiahs with you, ac-cording to the two wings of the dove, for in the fourth redemp-tion you will be like a torso without limbs. Initially Israel was like a torso, and you [Moses] and Aaron were like the two dove's wings, with which Israel flew.\"1l8 In RaJaya Meheimna and Tiqqunim, messianic associations are attached to the figure of Moses, the \"once and future\" leader, more than to any other figure.119 The talmudic tradition of the forty-nine gates of awarenesslZO that were given to Moses is inter-preted in sefirotic terms. The seven lower sefirot each contain, potentially, seven further sefirot, leading to the charged figure forty-nine that indicates the level of Moses' consciousness. The Messianic age will bring a renewed Torah from Moses, encom-passing the union of the lower and the intermediate sefirot: At the end of Moses' life in the last generation, he will reveal Only that shall happen which has happened (Ecclesiastes 1:9) .... There is no generation less than 600,000, of which it says the promise He gave for a thousand generations (Psalms 105:8) and he [Moses] extended through every generation, in every saint and sage that preoccupies himself with Torah, up to 600,000, to correct the blemish of each one. And the mean-ing of the term is He was wounded because of our sins (Isaiah 53:5) that he is weighed against all of them, as the Masters of the Mishnah saidl21 that one woman bore 600,000, imply-ing Moses who is like 600,000.122 Moses is the valiant enemy of the realm of qelippah.123 When he is overcome by catastrophes of misjudgment, his punishment is death and burial \"in the Mishnah,\" entomb-"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"The Myth of Chaos 53 ment in the mundanity of the exoteric tradition.124 As will be demonstrated in the fifth chapter of this study, Moses' fall is interpreted as an entanglement in the purely legalistic and casuistic dimension of the law. This flawed understanding is seen as a kind of violence against the Torah, as opposed to the Zohar's form of mystical speculation. The State of the Shekhinah The qualities of brokenness and disorder that characterize the nature of present existence are inherent in the sefirah Malkhut. This sefirah is the context into which the Divine effluence of the other sefirot flows. Because it is the beginning of existence, the base of the sefirotic tree, Malkhut is where humanity encounters the Divine. As is widely known, Malkhut is most often evoked in the figure of the Shekhinah, the symbolization of the Divine feminine. The symbolic imagery for the Shekhinah is the richest of all the theosophic Kabbalah. This process of symbolization is quite evident in the Bahir,125 the earliest work of theosophical Kabbalah. The Bahir personified the Shekhinah archetypally as bride,l26 princess, ecclesia of Israel, and simply Shekhinah. The Bahir also symbolizes the Shekhinah archetypally as earth, moon, citron, and date. Tiqqunei ha-Zohar draws from the rich store of images for this sefirah. A number of characteristic symbolizations may demonstrate the author's preoccupations. In levirate marriage and annulment, she is the shoe of rejection, because she repre-sents the banality of the physical dimension.127 Elsewhere, the Tiqqunim portrays the Shekhinah as the ur-mother, mistress of the Divine house,128 bound to Israel and bearing her vicissi-tudes,129 the earthly incarnation of the Divine.l3O She has a special relationship with the sages, for \"in exile, she rests on the Torah students like the Divine spirit that hovered over the watery chaos.\"131 Positive images of the Shekhinah portray her as the pardes (garden) of the Torah, in that she encompasses the four exegetical levels of PaRDeS. 132 Shekhinah embodies a number of dichotomous relation-ships. She encompasses both the negative potentials of the"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"54 The Enlightened Will Shine sefirah Gevurah on the left side of the sefirotic tree and the positive qualities from the sefirah lfesed on the right side.133 The unification of both aspects takes place through the actions of the demiurgic figure of Metatron.134 The condition of Malkhut is itself a mixture of good and evil;135 its qualities of embodiment and incarnation are constantly shifting: \"Like silver mixed with dross, she is a tree whose bark is unclean from without while its essence is sweet within ... \"136 This dual nature is acknowl-edged in the prohibition of mixing wool and linen in one garment, which is a metaphysical expression of the dual na-ture nascent in Malkhut. These themes of wholeness and partiality are evoked in the seven week transition from the Passover to the Shavuot festival. The Passover table's broken maHah represents the de-monic realm of the left, while the whole maHot that envelope it derive their sacredness from the redemptive, inclusive realm of Tif'eret.137 In kabbalistic terms, the lel:zem 'oni, \"bread of pov-erty,\" represents the union of the sefirah Yesod, the nexus of sexuality, and Malkhut. In this way, wasting bread is compared to the taboo of masturbation, which is, after all, \"wasting seed.\"13s These images of incompleteness and completeness are mirrored liturgically in the recitation of the complete Hallel prayers on the first day of the festival, followed by the incom-plete Hallel on the subsequent days.139 In this way, the mystical experience of Passover invokes the pathos of the Shekhinah in her exile, at the outset of the redemption. The ensuing forty-nine days are a meditation on the repair of the seven interme-diate sefirot to unify them by the festival of Shavuot, which commemorates the theophany at Sinai. The Immanence of God in Tiqqunei ha-Zohar The chaos that is rife in the created world is mitigated, to some extent, by the immanent presence of God. Isaiah Tishby and Gershom Scholem140 have portrayed a doctrine of Divine imma-nence specific to the Ra'aya Meheimna and the Tiqqunim. Tiqqunei ha-Zohar and Ra'aya Meheimna employ the doctrine of the four worlds of creation, A{Uut, Beriah, Ye~irah and 'Asiyyah. According to Gershom Scholem,141 the doctrine of the four worlds may have"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The Myth of Chaos 55 derived from contemporary gnostic ideas. It also owes much to early Kabbalah's adoption of the Neoplatonic concept of hypos-tases, progressive emanations of Divine effluence. The Zohar hardly explores the juxtaposition of the terms Bara-Ya?ar-'Asah.142 It describes the sefirot as extensions of God, linear hierarchies of Neoplatonic, hypostatic emanation. The higher sefirot are necessarily closer to the essence of the Godhead, whereas the lower sefirot are that much more alienated from this pure essence. The undifferentiated, abstracted Divine is called A?ilut, or emanation. This undifferentiated realm is also called the 'alma de-yil)udah, or \"world of unity,\" as opposed to the 'alma de-perudah, or \"differentiated world.\" The ultimate abstraction is also called Ein Sof, \"infinity,\" or Ayin, the \"noth-ingness\" that stands at the peak of the Godhead.143 Tiqqunei ha-Zohar and Ra'aya Meheimna use of this idea, showing the influence of the Masekhet A?ilut, an early four-teenth-century work, as well as the writings of R. Isaac of Acre. Scholem noted, in the Tiqqunim, three applications of the doc-trine of the four worlds.144 The first consists of the worlds as denoted without their formal names.145 The second usage in-volves the terms sefirot of A?ilut, sefirot of Beriah and so forth. 146 Finally the worlds are expressed anthropomorphically the struc-tures \"Adam of A?ilut, Adam of Beriah.\"147 For example,148 Primordial Man [Adam Qadma'ah] [is] from the realm of pu-rity, for there is another Adam, from the realm of impurity, and what's more, there are three \"Adam's\": Primordial Adam, who is the Adam of Beriah, Adam of Ye;:irah, Adam of 'Asiyyah from the realm of purity. And there is another from the realm of impurity, the worthless Adam (Adam Beliyya'aT), a man of sin, the Evil Inclination. The good Adam is the Good Inclina-tion, as the elders have said (Ecclesiastes 7:14) The one no less than the other was God's doing ... The anthropomorphic employment of the doctrine of the worlds also pOSits a separate realm of the demonic. This Adam Beliyya'al is apparently a shadow of the Adam of 'Asiyyah, the lowest world.

These vessels are dis-tinct, but not entirely separate, from the undifferentiated unity of A.~ilUt.149 In these later compositions, the emanation of the Divine takes place across three realms: Ein Sof, the infinite abstraction of God; 'cqmut, the essence of God; and kelim, the vessels.150 The sefirot are powers or qualities of God, but they have no existence in and of themselves. 151 They are called temunat ha-Shem, the \"image of the Divine,\" the medium through which the immanent Divine reigns equally in all di-mensions of existence. According to this doctrine of immanence, 'Illat ha-'Illot, the \"Cause of Causes,\" the most transcendent aspect of God, extends through the medium of the sefirot into corporeality.152 One common paradigm of this immanent emanation is the linear understanding of the emanation through the name YHVH. 153 In this paradigm, each letter of the Divine name rep-resents one or more sefirot, so that every recitation of the name in prayer is a meditation on the sefirotic structure of the the universe. All the names and kinnuyim of God are signs, point-ing to the sefirot, which in tum point to the Divine.154 'Illat ha-'Illot is distinguished by its dynamic qualities. In the Ra'aya Meheimna and Tiqqunim, Ein Sof, \"Infinity,\" is identi-fied with 'Illat ha-'Illot and also with Keter, the uppermost sefirah.155 At these levels of ~ilut, there is unity of the essence and the sefirot: \"One doesn't say of 'Illat ha-'Illot, 'He said to Keter, let us make man ... \" He said to them 'Let your ears hear what your mouth says ...

The theological applications of this doctrine of immanence bring kabbalistic theology from the detached, monistic stance of the lohar into a \"theistic, personalistic\"157 understanding of God, creator and first cause, whose existence transcends all corporeality and is distinct from the Divine essence.

The substance of this critique was utilized in the theoretical literature of the Sabbatean and I:Iasidic movements. The conflict between the halakhic and kabbalistic tradi-tions originates in the distinctions between the Torah's mystical nature and its exoteric character. In most cases, the practitio-ner was forced to choose between a mystical consciousness and a legalistic consciousness.! The Tiqqunim and RaJaya Meheimna conduct a polemic, advocating the former over the latter. The Two Torahs The Tiqqunim and RaJaya Meheimna portray two aspects of the Torah: the Torah of A?ilut (emanation) and the Torah of Beriah (creation). The doctrine of the two Torahs is a mythic expres-sion of the distinction between the Torah's exoteric and the esoteric levels. The author of these works derived this idea from certain dualistic images in the Bible. 59"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"60 The Enlightened Will Shine In mythic terms, these two kinds of Torah were conceived separately, in the aftermath of the fall. They originate in the two World Trees in the garden of Eden. The E{ ljayyim, or Tree of Life, is synonymous with the Torah of A{ilut, whereas the E{ ha-Da'at Tov ve-Ra', or Tree of Knowledge, is identified with the Torah of Beriah. The model practitioner is the {Qddik (saint) of the Tree of Knowledge, rather than the mere \"man\" of the Tree of Life.2 Moses' breaking the first tablets of the Torah, in the inci-dent of the golden calf, was another catastrophe that exacer-bated the division between these two aspects of the Torah.3 The first tablets represented the spiritual essence of the Torah, the Torah of A?ilut, which is now available only to mystics. The second tablets constitute the Torah of Beriah, which is charac-terized by historicity. Its commandments are the product of this Torah's shell or qelippah. Hence, preoccupation with the mere commandments is an embrace of the most extraneous, irrel-evant aspect of the Torah. The two Torahs' functions are also understood in sefirotic terms, as stages in the path of the emanation of Divine efflu-ence. The Torah of A?ilut comprises the energies of the sefirah Ifokhmah that are gathered under the sefirah Tif'eret. This is the undifferentiated Torah whose origins precede the creation of the world.4 In one example from the Tiqqunim, the maskil's relationship with the Tree of Life, and its accompanying Torah of A?ilut, is depicted in terms of a halakhic metaphor: The Masters of the Mishnah taught:5 One doesn't climb a tree or straddle it or use it. I ask you, 0 Holy Spark, not in the simple, physical manner of the Masters of the Mishnah, but in the secret way, the spiritual way, as it says: The maskilim will shine. He said to him: \"0 venerable sage,6 I will tell you, for you are from the realm of the Tree of Life, which is planted in the Sabbath Queen, which needs no person to tend it, as has been learned:7 He who uses the crown will depart.8 The speaker asks Shimon Bar Yol)ai to explain the law in which trees may be part of a Sabbath boundary. The law is a metaphor for the way that the Tree of Life is defiled by the"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Halakhah and Kabbalah 61 prosaic legalism of the Torah of Beriah. Using the Tree is like violating the ernv, the Sabbath boundary portrayed metaphori-cally as the boundary between the sacred and the profane. The Torah of Beriah relates to the realm of the Shekhinah, the realm of the differentiated world.9 This Torah is the outer garment of the Shekhinah, its debased aspect.lO There are dan-gers in mistaking the essence of the Torah for its garment. The perverse behavior of the rebelious son, as portrayed in the Passover liturgy is one example of this mistaken world-view: There is a Torah of Beriah and a Ijokhmah of Beriah and a Binah of Beriah and so it is with all the qualities (senrot). In this Torah the son may be without mifvah and mifvah sepa-rated from the Torah. Hence: the rebellious son. But from the realm of Afilut there is no separation. One is in no danger of sin; and there is no punishment and no reward and no death. This Torah is the Tree of Life, the reward of the world-to-come, for this Tree of Life is called the world-to-come. But for the rebellious son, it is not called reward because this son did not strive in the Torah to receive a reward, not in action, speech, or thought. 11 The rebellious son is a metaphor for the practitioner of the exoteric Torah, the legalist or rationalist who sees no deeper meaning to the commandments than their exoteric nature. There is an internal contradiction in the doctrine of the two aspects of the Torah. The exoteric levels of rabbinic schol-arship, preoccupation with the biblical text and the law, are also essential aspects of the Divine, not misapprehensions of it. Yet they remain a covering for the primordial, inner Torah. Halakhah determines the adept's corporeal existence, but kabbalistic wisdom is understood as the vessel for the channel-ing of Divine effluence, the stuff of enlightenment.12 The potentially antinomian possibilities of this doctrine engrossed the Jerusalem scholars of Jewish historiography: Yi?1]ak Baer, Gershom Scholem, and the latter's disciple, Isaiah Tishby. These scholars were influenced by the subsequent ap-plication of these ideas, particularly their eschatological aspect, in the Sabbatean heresy."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"62 The Enlightened Will Shine Gershom Scholem defined the tensions regarding Torah and law in the Tiqqunim in terms of two questions: the relation-ship of the Torah to the fall of man, and the messianic Torah.13 In Scholem's view, the author of the Tiqqunim recognized the legitimacy of rabbinic Judaism. He also, however, viewed rab-binic Judaism as a mediating garment, which would be re-moved in the messianic age. According to Scholem, the author considered the Oral Torah as the less legitimate version of reality. This understanding had a definite utopian-eschatologian application, which was to find expression in Sabbateanism.14 Yi.~l)ak Baer understood the doctrine of the two Torahs as a revolt against the rabbis of the age, part of a pattern of uprisings against leadership of all the Western religions. All the same, he did not view it as a campaign against rabbinic Juda-ism. According to Baer, the author's ambivalence towards the halakhah derived from the tension between Jewish survival in the Diaspora and national yearnings. Out of this tension came a great yearning for the creation of a new Torah that would be wholly godly. Its practitioners would necessarily be pious ascet-ics primarily concerned with values of devotionalism, humility, and simplicity of thought.15 This understanding is in keeping with Baer's general preoccupation with the eschatological and social aspects of the Ra'aya Meheimna's teachings, particularly as they resembled the writings and doctrines of his Christian contemporaries. Isaiah Tishby has assembled the most exhaustive review, to date, of the various contradictory statements regarding the Torah in his master work, Mishnat ha-Zohar.16 Tishby considers the author's distinctions and contradictions potentially irrecon-cilable: \"[Ra'aya Meheimna and Tiqqunim] have a peculiar un-derstanding of the role of the Torah. Rather than a har-mony between the various aspects of the Torah, there is a confusion of divisions and chasms, with images of bitterness and ugliness. It is a Torah of changed intent, with images of exile and alienation predominating over enlightenment and spiritual purity. This area is also rife with internal contradic-tions.\"l? After an exhaustive analysiS of many of the references to the exoteric tradition, Tishby concludes:"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Halakhah and Kabbalah 63 I see no way of resolving such a multitude of inconsistencies. On the one hand, the author extols the halakhah, its litera-ture, and those who teach and study it. On the other hand, he despises them as the straw and waste matter of the Torah, or as asses, and agents of the demonic. Any attempt to bridge the gap between these two diametrically opposed pOints of view is doomed to failure .... We find ourselves face to face with an extraordinary kabbalist who, for unknown reasons, perhaps connected with his own personal psychology or with some social situation, tried to have the best of both worlds, seeking both to glorify and destroy rabbinic tradition .... My view, in brief, is that the author of the Ra'aya Meheimna had antinomian tendencies, but was careful not to express him-self entirely negatively, even with respect to the Messianic age. IS Perhaps a review of the author IS portrayal of the tension between Kabbalah and halakhah will further clarify his attitude toward the halakhah and its agents. Rather than examine ev-ery contradictory reference to the subject, I will examine themes that are recurrent or, in the case of contradictions, dominant. The Mystic and the Law The Tiqqunim and Ra'aya Meheimna seem to view rabbinic ca-suistry as unrelated to the principle aim of contemplative study, the redemption of the Shekhinah, the realm of present exist-ence. The legal system of halakhah is often portayed as debased and temporary. This legal structure will, inevitably, be sup-planted by the idealized and unrealized law that lies nascent in the secrets of Kabbalah.19 Throughout the Tiqqunim and Ra'aya Meheimna, the author yearns for release from the rigid mentality of rabbinic casuistry. In deprecating the exoteric level of the Torah, the author uses a number of midrashic and kabbalistic hermeneutical categories. One of these was the acronym PaR DeS, a term that was apparently originated by Moshe de Leon. PaR DeS distin-guishes the levels of the exoteric and esoteric Torah in the following terms: peshat (simple meaning), remez (allegory), derash (midrash), and sad (the esoteric meaning).20 Two changes in terminology are characteristic of the Tiqqunim's typology: the"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"64 The Enlightened Will Shine use of the term re'ayot2! instead of remez and the denigratory pi shoneh halakhot22 instead of peshat. 23 The strength of the PaR DeS formula is that it implies that the four levels of the Torah are coexistent with one another. This conciliatory position derived from classical rabbinic understandings of the Torah's multiplic-ity of meaning. The author of the Tiqqunim, however, utilized the typologies of PaR DeS to stress his pejorative view of the literal meaning of the text. The four dimensions of the Divine text are also metaphors for the cosmic structure and the stages of mystical inquiry. The achievement of the Torah's fourth and deepest level, sod, is the goal of mystical quest. This is in keeping with another impor-tant theme in the Tiqqunim, that of transition from demonic triunity to redemptive quatemity. Elsewhere, however, these four aspects of the Torah are described as sustenance for the soul,24 the merkavah or vehicle of enlightenment.25 Tiqqunei ha-Zohar and Ra'aya Meheimna employ the signifiers peshat, the simple meaning of the text, and pesaq, the determination of the law, to deprecate the significance of the exoteric Torah. In fact, the author interprets many technical expressions of the halakhic process as signifiers for aspects of existence in the realm of the sefirah Malkhut. In this way, the Masters of the Mishnah and the posqei halakhot, /I determiners of the law,\" abuse the Shekhinah in her bitter exile. 26 The questions, contradictions and lack of resolution that characterize the Talmud represent hidden and inchoate aspects of present existence. As such, they are instruments of survival in the benighted realm of Malkhut: With the addition of the letter vav, pesaq [literally, halakhic judgment] becomes pasuq [literally, verse]. The verse that con-tains all halakhic decisions, that are the Shekhinah, tashbap,27 shama'nu,28 shitah,29 tiyuvtah,30 tosefta,31 haggadah, tayqu32, tania, Kabbalah, halakhah, mishnah, baraita, qushia,33 mal)loqet, l)umrah,34 and qulah.35 The Shekhinah is in the question, which the sage asks relevantly and answers according to the halakhah.36 The confusion and randomness of the Talmud seem to derive from the absurdity of present existence. The author ma-"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Halakhah and Kabbalah 65 ligns that dimension of existence, the halakhah that governs it, and the rabbis who propagate halakhah. The realm of plain meaning is also described as demonic as a serpent's bite.37 Even the cantillation point sof pasuq, \"end of a verse,\" refers to sof pesaq halakhot; that is, \"the end of law making!\"38 The Talmud itself is portrayed as a barrier, blocking the individual from the attainment of kabbalistic illumination. This relationship is even expressed in a halakhic metaphor: halakhah is like the stag-nant water brought into the purifying pool, whereas Kabbalah derives from the pure rivers that nurture both the Garden of Eden and the Tree of Life.39 The Typologies of the Legalist and the Mystic The author of the Tiqqunim objects to the halakhist's social role in a manner in keeping with his critique of the Jewish commu-nity.40 Satirically, he refers to them as the lJamorei ha-Torah, \"donkeys of the Torah. \"41 More lethally, they are also portrayed as venal opportunists, motivated by the desire for personal gain: Many masters of study, colleagues of yours, nightly cry out contradictions in the Oral Torah, crying like dogs who say \"Hav hav!\", as it is written (Proverbs 30:13) The leech has two daughters, \"Give\" and \"Give. \"42 Give us wealth in this world, give us wealth in the next world, as it is taught:43 Learn much Torah and you will be given much reward. And there is no one who is occupied with the Torah in order to raise the Shekhinah from the Diaspora and to unite her with the husband, for their eyes are blind, and their hearts are sealed.44 The author of the Tiqqunim reordered the classical hierar-chies of rabbinic authority. In a series of Hebrew puns, the talmudic scholars are portrayed as slaves in Egypt, embittering their own lives with the stringencies and refinements of the law: \"The Masters of the Mishnah said: They embittered their lives with hard work [avodah qashahJ (Exodus 1:14) with difficul-ties with mortar [lJomerJ with kal va-lJomerz45 with bricks [levenim] with tempering [libbun] of the halakhah, with all the work in the field, that is baraita,46 with all their work, that is Mishnah.\"47"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"66 The Enlightened Will Shine Elsewhere, this anonymous kabbalist employs plainly me-dieval imagery to illustrate the relationship between the halakhist and the mystic. The halakhists are portrayed as ba'alei terisim, \"shield bearers,\" foot soldiers for the knights of the Kabbalah: \"A voice calls out in the Academy: 'How many of you are shield bearers of the Oral Torah, come to do battle with the serpent?' \"48 The actions of the shield bearers, however, are by defini-tion futile: \"The shield bearers come into the Academy; yet with their leniencies and stringencies, They turn this way and that and there is no one (Exodus 2:12).\"49 The \"shield\" of the Oral Law is akin to the classical kabbalistic symbol of the qelippah, or shell, which separates the individual from the Divine.50 Each is a barrier to deeper, more profound knowledge. For the legalist and the mystic, coexistence is possible only if the legalist accepts a secondary role, creating the context for the mystic's erotic quest. Tiqqunei ha-Zohar and Ra'aya Meheimna em-ploy two models to describe the positive function of the halakhists, the model of the foot soldier and the model of the stonecutter. In one text in particular, they play these roles almost Simultaneously, storming the fortress of the Matronita, or Shekhinah, and building her a trysting place for union with the Godhead: There are men who exert themselves in the Oral Torah for its own sake; they are its artisans. There are those who cut stones, mountains and mighty rocks. Afterwards they perfect them with questions and of them it says: Build it of whole stones (Deuteronomy 27:6). With them they make many buildings for the King and Queen to dwell in. These decisions are gar-ments for the Queen, they cut many facets into them, then perfect them with many questions, in which the Matronita may appear before the King. And at that time you will see it as an everlasting covenant (Genesis 9:16). These are the gar-ments of the high priest, the four white garments and the four golden garments. 51 At this point, the chisel of the stonecutter is transformed into the weapon of the foot soldier, as the halakhists become the infantry of the Divine army:"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Halakhah and Kabbalah 67 These garments are the decisions of the shield bearers that come from the study house, who cut and set them with their tongues as with swords and lances, like horsemen on dry land and the sea, which are themselves the Written and the Oral Torahs. Happy are they, with the King between them, the central pillar, that encompasses the Written and Oral Torahs, which are given from the right and the left, with which they make war. Woe to those who go to battle without the King, of them it is written (Psalms 19:4): There is no utter-ance, there are no words, whose sound goes unheard. All of the artisans are found in the innersz Oral Torah as it says: All the honor of the princess is within (Psalms 45:14).53 The midrashic image of the hammer on the rock, giving off sparks in every direction, is the classical expression of the Torah's multiplicity of meaning.54 In a further exploration of the image of stonecutting as a metaphor for rabbinic casuistry, the creation of Oral Torah is compared to Moses' violent strik-ing of the rock at Merivah (Numbers 24:21). This catastrophe amounts to the rape of the Shekhinah: Moses' rock, of which it says: You will speak to the rock before their very eyes and it will yield its water (Numbers 20:8)-this is a Divine voice, on which is contingent only speech and sup-plication. But the maidservant is another rock that is called Mishnah, the feminine, slave, servant. Of it it says: A slave cannot be disciplined by words (Proverbs 29:19); rather he strikes it and connects from it various decisions and collects them and they are called collected ... with no flow of wisdom or Kabbalah. My rock is called the Princess, so it says: You will speak to the rock before their very eyes and it will yield its water, with words and persuasion, like a Princess. Since he forced her and struck her, death was decreed for him. For one who refuses the Matronita incurs the death sentence, all the more so one who forces the princess. So it was decreed that he should not enter the land of Israel, to be buried in a strange land.55 Moses' violent disobedience creates a flawed tradition. His offense bars him from the land of Israel in the same way that casuistry bars the adept from enlightenment. This flawed"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"68 The Enlightened Will Shine hermeneutic originates with Moses, the Ra'aya Meheimna him-self: You are the one of whom it says: And he struck the rock ... (Numbers 24:21). For the Blessed Holy One instructed you to speak to the rock, and you did not do so, for if you had done it through speech they would be studying the To-rah with no doubt, with no question and dispute. Because it says of you: And he struck the rock and nothing came of it but single drops, so the Masters of the Mishnah are like those who strike the rock. Their tongues are like a hammer striking the rock, they decide many halakhic decisions, which accu-mulate drop by drop.56 The motif of Moses' striking the rock reinforces the com-parison of scholasticism to stonemasonry. The debased and degenerate halakhah is \"the burial place of Moses. \"57 Elsewhere, the rabbinic tradition is portrayed as a mining expedition that ends in disaster for its participants: Many Masters of the Mishnah have descended to the depths of the halakhah and have found the date of the liberation. Yet they have descended there and they have not escaped. Even though their language is like a hammer splintering a rock, their hammer is too exhausted to penetrate that rock, and whoever has done so without permission has been bitten by the serpent. And there are others who penetrated it until they came to the bottom of the primordial abyss, from which they have not escaped .... The Messiah, son of David, has fallen there with the Messiah, son of Joseph!58 The halakhists lack the wisdom to predict the date of the messianic age, and their attempts lead to disaster. 59 The motif of the stonecutter predominates over that of the foot soldier. Rather than drawing off the flowing waters of kabbalistic wis-dom, the halakhist chips and smashes the opaque crust of the Torah in images that invoke both violence and futility. The rabbinic hermeneutic is an act of violence against the Torah's essence."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Halakhah and Kabbalah 69 Pardes The well-known Rabbinic statement about the four who en-tered the Pardes, or mystical orchard, was particularly im-portant in kabbalistic hagiography. The account stresses the pitfalls of the mystic quest and the idealization of Rabbi Akiva, who \"entered in peace and departed in peace,\" as the paradigm of the integration of Law and mysticism.60 This seminal account is, oddly, largely unexplored in the main sections of the Zohar.61 It is cited repeatedly in the Tiqqunim62 and Ra'aya Meheimna,63 where it is presented as an example of the risks of mystical ascent. The author readily equates the Pardes, as orchard, with the multi-tiered hermeneutical PaRDeS.64 In the Tiqqunim, the four adepts parallel the four heads of the river that flowed through Eden, another mythical orchard.65 In a pun, the river Pishon is pi shoneh halakhot, the \"mouth teaching halakhot,\" the Oral Torah: It then divides and becomes four branches (Genesis 2:10). These are the four that entered the Pardes, one went to Pishon, which is pi shoneh halakhot. The second rose to the Gil)on, and there it is buried, of which it says: Anything that crawls on his belly (Leviticus 11:42).66 The third rose to the Ifideqel, sharp and light,67 this is the light and sharp language of derasha. The fourth entered Perot, which is the brain, which flourished and multiplies.68 Ben Zoma and Ben Azzai went up in the qelippin of the Torah and were harmed by them. R. Akiva went up in the mind. Of him it is said that he went up in peace and departed in peace. 69 The avnei shayish tahor, the stones of pure marble that are the object of Rabbi Akiva's warning, are understood by the author though a recurring theme of scholasticism as stonema-sonry. These stones are the second tablets of the Torah, the result of the disaster of the golden calf. The three victims of the ascent erred in equating the prosaic stones of marble with the life-giving waters of the mystic wisdom:"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"70 The Enlightened Will Shine When Moses brought the two tablets of the Torah down to Israel, they were unworthy of them, and they were smashed, causing the loss of the first and second Temples .... He brought them others from the realm of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and, Evil, from which is brought the Torah of forbidden and permitted, from the right, life and, from the left, death, so Rabbi Akiva said to his students, \"When you come to the pure stones of marble do not say 'Water, water.'\" For the other stones are life and death, the heart of the wise on the right and the heart of the fool on the left. Moreover, you will endanger yourselves, for those of the Tree of Knowledge are in separation, while the stones of pure marble are in unity, with no separation at all,7Â° The reference to the stones is deliberately obscure in the Talmud's rendering, making it an appropriate object of subse-quent exegesis. Tiqqunei ha-Zohar continues of the image of the Torah as stone, to be crafted or mutilated according to the expertise or the ineptitude of the scholar-adept. In sefirotic terms, the three hapless Rabbis ascended only to the realm of qelippah, while Rabbi Akiva entered in the realm of mol;zin, the Divine mind. This qelippah that entangles the three victims is compared to the foreskin that covers the uncircumcized membrum viril: liThe four who entered the Pardes are from the realm of the foreskin. Three ate from those qelippot and died, and the fourth ate the inner fruit and threw out the qelippot and lived, just as Rabbi Meir found a pomegranate, ate its inner part and threw out the husk.\"71 Rabbi Meir, although a contemporary of Rabbi Akiva, is not a figure in the original Pardes account. His II discarding the husk\" was an analogy for his continued study with the apos-tate Elisha Ben Abuya.72 Here it is adapted as metaphor for the mystic's relationship to the exoteric Torah. The adept discards the husk of the halakhah to extract the deeper, kabbalistic mean-ing of the text.73 This image is also employed in a national metaphor: liThe pomegranate: Ben Zoma sinned with it, while Rabbi Meir ate the kernel and threw out the husk. For the husk are the nations of the world and Israel is the intellect within. In the same way, the Shekhinah is the Pardes in the exile, with the"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Halakhah and Kabbalah 71 intellect within. It is called the nut, as King Solomon said I went down to the nut garden (Song of Songs 6:11), and the Shekhinah is the hidden fruit.\"74 So it is that the exoteric dimension of the Torah is a bar-rier or shell for the esoteric dimension.75 The hapless victims, enmeshed in the qelippot, saw and died,76 so that the malevo-lence of the three exoteric dimensions destroyed the victims of the ascent. 77 The negotiation of the treacherous qelippot is not merely the goal of personal quest, but has resonance for the fate of the Jewish people. The Masters of the Mishnah The way that Tiqqunei ha-Zohar and Ra'aya Meheimna employ the term Masters of the Mishnah is particularly complex. On one hand, the expression as the Masters of the Mishnah established is used frequently to introduce a Rabbinic dictum, be it halakhah or aggadah, which is then interpreted kabbalistically.78 None-theless, the Masters of the Mishnah are caught in a prosaic level of consciousness: Fish and locusts require no ritual slaughter, only gathering. So it is that the masters of the Academy do not require ritual slaughter, rather it says of them: Breathing his last, he was gathered to his people (Genesis 49:33). Just as fish must live in the sea, so the sages, the Masters of the Mishnah, must live in the Torah; if they are taken from it, they die immediately. The Tannaim of the Mishnah proliferate in it like the fish in the sea, yet if they are on dry land and are thrown into the sea, not knowing how to swim, they die. But Adam the mas-ter of Kabbalah, which is above, is above them all. It says of him: He will rule the fish of the sea and the birds of the air (Genesis 1:26), who are the Masters of the Mishnah ... during their study, they have disagreements and question one an-other, each swallowing his colleague ... 79 This ambivalence toward the Masters of the Mishnah ex-tends to their source text, the Mishnah itself. As a result of its inherent duality, Mishnah can be a positive or a negative en-tity, according to the worthiness of its interpreter. There is,"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"72 The Enlightened Will Shine despite the images presented thus far, a positive aspect of the halakhist's struggle with the law. Sometimes, the Oral Torah is not malevolent, merely secondary: The maskilim are the masters of the biblical text will shine, these are the Masters of the Mishnah, for these Masters of the Mishnah are the forty-nine facets of purity and the forty-nine facets of impurity .... 80 The Masters of the Mishnah are illu-minated in these forty-nine facets. They are second to the halakhah, its maidservant, just as Mordechai the Jew was second to the King.81 So Mishnah is second to the king; the Masters of the Mishnah are illuminated in it. Like the shining of the firmament; this is the halakhah, the tradition to Moses from Sinai. It has many ladies in waiting, the legal decisions, the maidens without number (Song of Songs 6:8).82 The position of the Masters of the Mishnah, bound to time and space, is contrasted with the cosmic role of the maskilim. Nonetheless, the Talmud remains a valid path of ascent to the level of the maskilim: And she rises above them all, as it says: You went above them all (Proverbs 31 :29) and she is with them all, as it says, The law is like the majority. And those who lead the many to righ-teousness will be stars forever, as the stars cannot be counted. And these \"maidservants\" (,alamot) call them, rather, worlds ('olamot). For the Righteous are like stars, each one has a star of his own; so our ancestors taught that every taddik inhabits a world of his own.83 Then, in a Significant fusing of angelology and kabbalah, the Mishnah is identified with Metatron,84 the demiurgic go-between. In sefirotic terms, Metatron embodies the union of the lower sefirot and Malkhut. Contemplation of the Oral Torah brings the adept to the union of the lowest sefirot. All of the euphemisms of youth and servitude that are used to invoke Metatron also describe the functions of the exoteric Torah: And whoever achieves one halakhah inherits one world. All the more so for one who achieves a tractate, or two, or sixty,"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Halakhah and Kabbalah 73 of whom it says: There are sixty queens (Song of Songs 6:8). For every tractate has the Matronita within it. Happy is he who inherits her in this world. The halakhah is the maidser-vant of the Matronita, Kabbalah. Happy are they who strive for the Shekhinah who is over everything, through halakhah, to free her from exile of which it says: For your sins your mother was sent (Isaiah 50:1), to escort her to her husband, that he might embrace her, as in: His right hand under my head ... (Song of Songs 2:6). In the exile Mishnah, which is Mettatron rules, and it is Mishneh la-Melekh, the second to the King. Mishnah is the seat of the Matronita. And this is: The maidservant who displaces her mistress (Proverbs 30:23). And on the day of Moses the maidservant doesn't rule, rather the Matronita. After Moses died, Joshua, the youth, inher-ited, so the maidservant rules.85 Elsewhere, rabbinic hermeneutics, as well as the keeping of the commandments and the act of prayer, are described as Metatron's tallit or cloak.86 Metatron's dominion of the lower sefirot is portrayed in terms of familiar social typologies: \"There are two types of people who Metatron controls: the Masters of the Mishnah. On the fish in the sea, these are the sages. The birds of the air, these are the ones who have merit. And on the beasts, [these are] the ignorant.\"87 What is the true place of the Mishnah in the cosmic or-der?

These are the ones who say \"There is no Torah other than the simple meaning, there is no other secret meaning!\" And these facets [par?unn] are the fifty-three [tractates of the Talmud], of which it says a locked gar-den95 is my sister my bride (Song of Songs 4:12).96 The limitations of rabbinic consciousness cause the deso-lation of the Oral Tradition. Implicit in this criticism is the assumption that an unfettered consciousness would release some of the bonds of the law. The Dividedness of the Shekhinah In purely kabbalistic terms, present existence is that which takes place at the bottom of the sefirotic tree, in the senrah of Malkhut, the domain of the Shekhinah. The rituals and strictures of rabbinic Judaism, which make up exoteric practice, are fore-most an act of interaction with this senrah. The Shekhinah suf-fers in exile, and the burden of the law is part of her suffering. The pluralism and multifacetedness of the Oral Torah derive from its flawed nature. The pettiness and sophistry of legalistic casuistry were also caused by these divisions in the realm of the Shekhinah."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Halakhah and Kabbalah 75 Another kabbalistic paradigm describes the transcendent Written Torah as deriving from the sefirah lfesed, the realm of loving kindness. The exoteric Oral Torah derives from Din, the quality of harsh judgment.97 Nonetheless, this Torah, which actualizes the Bible in present reality, is the domain of the Shekhinah. In kabbalistic terms, it is also the realm of the Torah of Beriah and the Tree of Knowledge. The mi~ot, command-ments, form the medium of religious experience in the realm of Malkhut. The six higher sefirot remain ineffable, as lithe Blessed Holy One is closed in the secrets of Torah as much as He is known in mi~ot, which are Shekhinah. \"98 The Talmud's accumulation of unresolved conflicts and disputations is an overt sign of the dividedness of the Shekhinah and the unredeemed state of the law. The Talmud's myriad disputations (mal)loqot) contain both valid and invalid ques-tions.99 Some of these disputations originate in the uncleanli-ness of the divided realm of Malkhut.1oo Others derive from God's separation of the upper and lower waters during the act of Creation.

Therefore Moses was buried outside of the Holy Land, and his grave is the Mishnah, and no man knows his burial place to this day, for it was a tradition to Moses and the King, and the queen is separate from her spouse, therefore (Proverbs 30:21-23): The earth shudders at three things ... a slave who becomes king; this is that slave, and the slave girl is the Mishnah.

(Genesis 1:6) [God] separated the waters of purity, the fit and the permitted from the waters of the forbidden, the impure and unfitness, the waters of the broken well, putrid and filthy.\"119 This critique of legalism is the doctrinal parallel of the Zohar's criticism of the plain reading of the Torah and the philosophical rationalism. Two halakhic structures are really being presented: a debased casuistic form, which is opposed by a primordial and beautific reality originating from an ideal-ized Mishnah. Talmudic casuistry can tum to sophistry, an empty, worthless realm. There is a \"Mishnah of Truth,\" tran-scending the dichotomies of permitted-forbidden, pure-impure, and sacred-profane. The adept must synthesize these two di-mensions of the law."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"78 The Enlightened Will Shine Various halakhic dicta reflect this tension. For instance, the Tannaitic directive that one must act on the topic at hand and reply with the appropriate ruling (shoel ka-'inyan u-meshiv ka-halakhah) is interpreted, in Tiqqunei ha-Zohar, as maintain-ing an esoteric consciousness while discoursing on the exoteric level.12o In the same way, two biblical precepts involving the Torah invoke its dual nature. They are Hagita bo, the responsi-bility of study and preoccupation, and the commandment that the king copy out a Torah scroll. That latter mi?Vah, the act of reproducing a perfect text, requires the quality of being unblemished attained by Jacob, the paradigm of Tif'eret, free of detritus, \"for if the scroll is flawed, then it is disqualified.\"121 Often these typologies are presented in the context of halakhic understandings of the vicissitudes of marriage. Hence, the exo-teric law is allegorized as a kind of libel of the virginity of the bride, the supemallaw.122 The coexistence of the legalist and the mystic is symbol-ized in the dual traditions of halakhah to Moses from Sinai and kabbalah to Moses from Sinai. 123 The intrusion of halakhah is portrayed as a rupture in the erotic union of the Shekhinah with the transcendent aspects of the Divine: This is the way that she goes up to him. Two thighs that are the two pillars of truth, and when she rises to the embrace of his two arms she is called kabbalah. And when she kisses him on the mouth she is called the Oral Torah, and at that moment what leaves the mouth of the king is upheld by the faithful shepherd. With him I speak mouth to mouth (Numbers 12:8). When she rises to her feet in the last exile she is called halakhah to Moses from Sinai, for the King is called kabbalah to Moses from Sinai ... and when the halakhah becomes far from Moses, below, the Shekhinah becomes an argument with God. When she is not in his arms, kabbalah, there is a dispute above, hence: Hear a Mountains the dispute of God (Micah 6:2). These are the three Patriarchs, and their argument is the Shekhinah, for when one reverses the letters, Rabbi (RB\"Y) is riv (RY'B) [dispute].124 This is the Rabbi from the land of Israel, and with him the Shekhinah is in conflict.125"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Halakhah and Kabbalah 79 The relative functions of the halakhists and kabbalists are ren-dered in terms of the union or estrangement of the primoridal lovers, the Godhead and the Shekhinah. A survey of the relative role of this mysterious author's observations regarding halakhah and Kabbalah in overall con-text seems to support Scholem's understanding, in which rab-binic Judaism retains its legitimacy, yet remains less valid than kabbalistic doctrine. Tishby's arguments seem crushed under the weight of the many relevant allusions in the text, whereas Scholem apparently gleaned the most general tendendes among the profusion of references. One might say that Scholem, like Rabbi Meir, was able to \"eat the pomegranate and discard the husk.\" Scholem's growing preoccupation with the Sabbatean heresy did lead to his repeatedly assodating the teachings of the Ra'aya Meheimna and Tiqqunim with a nascent antinomian sentiment toward rabbinic authority. This tendency is different from the actual renundation of the commandments. The com-mandments, as they are presented in the Tannaitic writings with which the Zohar and Tiqqunim are meant to be contem-poraneous, are not to be questioned or altered. In methodological terms, Scholem and Baer are overly in-fluenced, in their understandings of the author's relationship to halakhah, by the subsequent misuse of the doctrine of the two Torahs by the Sabbateans. A problematic tendency of such his-toriography is to impute nascent motives into such a text based on the actions of that text's historical interpreters. A phenom-enological or literary methodology, as opposed to such a purely historiographical view, holds more promise for the resolution of such contradictory texts in the Tiqqunim and Ra'aya Meheimna. Yet the author's own literary methodology was to con-struct the text according to the assodations prevalent in his own stream of consdousness. These assodations, and the uses of tropes of the Oral Torah in the Tiqqunim, indicate that the language of the law has theurgic meaning.

In fact, the role of halakhah in Tiqqunei ha-Zohar and Ra'aya Meheimna can be determined through examining the domi-nant rabbinic motifs cited in these works. The author proposes a theurgic religious practice grounded in theosophical Kabbalah. Tiqqunei ha-Zohar and Ra'aya Meheimna tend to employ more widespread and sophisticated symbolization of halakhic ideas than the earlier sections of the Zohar. The law's mystical dimension flows from the mystique of practice, creating new possibilities for religious experience. 81"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"82 The Enlightened Will Shine Halakhic systems and rhetoric are means of interaction with the hidden functions of the Divine. Religious practice is a means of deepening one's understanding of the hidden and the re-vealed elements of existence. The practitioner's existential situ-ation is in tension with the origins of the formal rite. Historical distance from the \"simple\" understanding of the ritual act in-vokes a mystery, the disjunction of present reality and the transcendent. The individual laws are metaphors for human and na-tional conditions. The tropes of halakhah join biblical refer-ences as fuel for the author's flow of symbolic associations. Even the rabbis' social observations were reflective of meta-physical dynamics. Their ethical dicta do not merely describe patterns of religious behavior, but, rather, are insights into the very nature of the adept's condition. Contemplation of the Torah and the practice of the mi.~vot, particularly prayer, are also vehicles for kabbalistic theurgy.2 Tiqqunei ha-Zohar and Ra'aya Meheimna assign differing functions to the positive and the negative mi?Vot. The talmudic dictum \"One increases in holiness and one does not decrease\" is interpreted as implying that the negative mi?Vot are second-ary to the positive.3 The positive commandments are symbol-ized or alluded to in such images as the apotropaic dove's wings,4 or the Divine glory or kavod.5 Different areas of Jewish law are understood in broadly symbolic terms. For example, the citron of the feast of Tabernacles or the broken mCl.??ah of the Passover meal are symbols of the Shekhinah, as are all references to archetypal femininity. The laws concerning the return of lost property are seen as a metaphor for the restora-tion of authentic gnosis and the commonwealth.6 Similarly, the various agricultural tithes symbolize the experience of ex-ile.? Finally, the exile is symbolized by the forgotten sheaf lying in the \"field,\" itself an archetypal symbol of the Shekhinah.

Vows and oaths, therefore, derive their force from the nature of this Di-vine speech. Hence, the metaphysical binding power of vows and oaths derives from the same imperatives that bind God to the covenants with the Patriarchs. Vows are invested with greater power than oaths, because of their different nature. An oath, therefore, which is contingent on corporeal objects, derives from the transient world of temporal existence. A vow, which shapes the future behavior of the person who makes it, is contingent on the eternal world to come.14 All religious law necessarily contains aspects of the sefirah Gevurah, Divine judgment. The energies of that sefirah are ap-plied by the rabbinic court. IS Biblical forms of execution, for example, encompass the discharge of various aspects of Divine judgment.16 A corrupt judge is an agent of Samael.17 The grav-ity of a sin depends on whether it is tried in the earthly or the supernal Sanhedrin, or rabbinical court,18 because the two courts reflect higher and lower aspects of the Shekhinah.19 In Tiqqunei ha-Zoharand Ra'aya Meheimna, halakhic figures and tropes are employed in the associative weave of the kinnuyim.

The mi-?vot serve a purpose that is both protective and restorative. Their most important function is as an instrument in the struggle between the forces of good and evil. The com-mission of prohibited acts strengthens the forces of demonic chaos: Sin does not extinguish the Torah, but sin can extinguish mi?vah. A mi?vah is a lamp. Whoever commits a sin is really extinguishing his own lamp, of which it says: The human soul is the lamp of God (Proverbs 20:27). This extinguishing leaves his own body in darkness. One who draws the Shekhinah out of her place darkens and extinguishes that place. This dark-ness is sin, a slave-girl who supplants her mistress (Proverbs 30:23). Redeeming the mi?vah from the realm of the unlearned [ammei ha-are?] extinguishes their lamp, upholding (Samuel I 2:9) The wicked perish in darkness. But there is no extinguish-ing the Masters of the Torah, for they shine with many se-crets of the Torah. \"Light\" ['or] is called24 \"secret\" [raz]. And the mi?vot of the Torah that the rabbis uphold are the Torah for them, night and day it will not be extinguished for them, for they uphold: And you will meditate on them day and night (Joshua 1:8).25 The struggle between the holy and the demonic is re-flected empirically in the conditions of ritual purity and impu-rity. The palpability of tum'ah, ritual impurity, is apparent in Jewish mysticism as early as the merkavah tradition.26 Medieval philosophers had attempted to qualify the empirical nature of this status.27 Maimonidean tradition considered tum'ah an in-tellectual construct for the development of human values. The theosophical Kabbalah, however, considered it a source of em-pirical evil. According to this understanding, a demonic entity inhabits wounded [tre~ animals.

The gentile meat in the mar-ketplace is not merely forbidden but evil. Contact with it, and indeed with all elements of gentile culture, pollutes and defiles the adept, lowering his spiritual attainment. Nonetheless, meat infested with this spirit is still distinct from the demonic aspect of the sacrifice. The demonic's rapaciousness is satisfied by aspects of cer-tain sacrifices, the negative commandments, and the agricul-tural tithes. The scapegoat, the bitter waters of the unfaithful wife, the decapitated calf (Deuteronomy 21:1), the straps and the extra threads of hair in the tefillin are also detritus left for demonic forces and \"appeasement of the evil eye.\"31 Mixing of neutral quantities renders them demonic. This is the esoteric meaning of the biblical prohibition of the mix-ing of seed crops (kilayim), wool and linen (sha'atnez),32 and grafting fruit trees.33 The prohibitions of incest and other illicit liaisons are further examples of this illicit mixing. The case of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil is used to exemplify this demonization of mixed neutral quantities. Here, it is com-pared to the prohibited mixture of wool and linen: \"Every mi-?vah is a fruit-bearing tree, so it says: le-mino, \"of its kind.\" But the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil is not le-mino; it is mixed with other species, so it says: Don't sow your field with mixed seeds, nor wear mixtures of wool and linen (Leviticus 19: 19).\"34 The world exists in a dichotomized condition of good and evil. This is catastrophic, yet worse still is the confusion of these two forces. The interbreeding of species reflects the mythic chaos that encompasses existence. Order exists in the consciousness of the maskil, whose religious practice is an instrument for restoring order in the world."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"86 The Enlightened Will Shine The Motif of Quaternity The Heikhalot di-Qedushah, or \"Palaces of Holiness,\" is a section of the Zohar that details the heavenly palaces that sit at the base of the sefirotic tree.35 That text seems to associate the biblical forms of execution with the actions of the demonic: \"When the Other Side joins with judgment, its accusations reign in the four judicial executions: stoning, burning, the sword, and hanging.\" The Tiqqunim and Ra'aya Meheimna expand on this im-age, invoking a recurring paradigm of transition from demonic triunity to redemptive quaternity. These include the three years required for a fruit tree to reach maturity, the still small voice36 that announced Elijah's theophany37 and the three hapless victims of the expedition into the pardes. In kabbalistic terms, these structures signify a process of transition from a demonic triunity to a redemptive quaternity. The redemptive aspects of quaternity are further portrayed in the widely reproduced study of the four general categories of damages set forth in the Mishnah, the four avot neziqin. The talmudic laws of damages are identified with the four beasts that draw the celestial chariot of Ezekiel. 38 The adoption of this theme is a radical re-adaptation of an important and central area of talmudic discourse:39 Rise, Ra'aya Meheimna, to set forth the laws of damages in this order HVYH, which is (Psalms 68:18) God's chariots are myriads upon myriads that are the ox, eagle, lion, and man. On the right side, the side of YHVH, this is the order of the four beasts: man, lion, eagle, and ox, and according to the differences of the HVYH's are the movement and order of the beasts. The beasts are the other side, the damages of the left, this is their order SheNA''AN. Therefore their beginning, the ox, is related with the four major damages, the ox, the pit, the tooth, and the fire, and their conclusion is the suspected man.

ADNY (Lord) may be reversed to spell DINA (law). Therefore the Masters of the Mishnah said, the law of the malkhut is lawY All laws are judged with this name.\"42 The quaternity of the chariot symbolizes certain aspects of rabbinic civil law. In each case, the law leads the litigants from the demonic triunity of unrequited sin to the redemptive qua-ternity of completed judgment. Gevurah is particularly indi-cated by the Divine name ELOHIM: A rabbinical court requires three. The rabbinical court is the Shekhinah. Three, for the three Patriarchs. The central pillar is the True Judge, who judges from the realm of ADNY. The True Judge is there, and from the realm of the name ELOHIM he judges, as is written (Psalms 75:8): For Elohim judges. What judgments are there? One: the judgments of the ox; the sec-ond: the judgments of the pit; the third: the judgments of fire; and the fourth: the judgments of man.43 The rabbinical court of three is the agent of Gevurah. The judgment and punishment are purgative; when the judgment is carried out, the practitioner is spared further punishment. Beyond the four main families of damages, various halakhic constructs in civil law are presented as further instances of purgative judgment through redemptive quaternity: The laws of the four guardians, he who guards without pay-ment, with payment, the borrower, and the leaser, correspond to four judgments: the law of the divisions between partners, laws of division of land, the laws of slaves and maidservants, and the laws of litigants in all kinds of litigations, which may involve financial responsibility, theft, and loss, or the case of one who injures his neighbor and kills him, through one of the four legal executions.44 The agents of judgment for the transgression of command-ments are demonic forces.

Disability: the neglect of Torah, causing her to neglect her children. Healing: with words of Torah.48 Dam-ages: the mischief of the angels of destruction, rage and an-ger. Shame: for they shamed the Shekhinah with idolatry, lying, and saying Where is your God? (Psalms 42:4).

He stamped: with his horn he killed the Priests and Levites, destroying everything, he brought low the kingdom and its ministers (Lam-entations 2:2).51 The fourth source of damages, the pit, is portrayed as the devouring vaginal abyss of the demonic feminine. This havoc wrought by this demonic entity is portrayed in terms of the humbling of the city Jerusalem as portrayed in the book of Lamentations: The pit is the evil feminine, Lilit. In her house, a prison, the evil maidservant seized the Matronita and her children in exile and bound them in chains and ropes, and her children's hands are bound behind them. She sits among the nations and finds no rest (Lamentations 1:3), and what is more, all her suitors have shamed her, for they saw her nakedness, so she sighs and turns aside (Ibid. 1:8) Also the prostitute, the blazing fire: A fire has been set in Zion (Ibid. 4:11).

When they came out of the Exile, they were broken, until the food was sorted out from the detritus, the chaff and straw, the mixed multi-tude .... Until they were separated out, the Yud, the tithe, did not dwell on the Hey, the bread, made of the five types of grain as it says: Hand upon the throne of the Lord (Exodus 17:16).59 So the chaff and the straw do not require tithing until they have been separated .... Just as wheat that has been cleaned is brought to the storehouse, so the purified Israel are brought to Jerusalem, the mountain of God, as it says (Psalms 24:3): Who will come to the mountain of God, and who will risp up in His holy place? He who has clean hands and a pure heart ... or. The mystic discards and deprecates the exoteric aspect of the Torah. According to the halakhah, chaff and straw are not subject to tithes, and so the maskilim throw them away: \"These are the cattle, who only know the Torah's chaff, the outer shell,"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"The Theurgic Dimension of the Commandments 91 the straw, of which it says, 'straw and chaff are excused from tithing.' For the scholars of Torah, the masters of the secrets, throw the straw and chaff away and consume the Torah's inner kernel. The twenty-two letters of the Torah come to the sum I].itah [wheat] ... \"61 The search for the essence of the law is compared to sifting flour. The mixed multitude are the result of the incomplete sifting of the \"flour\" that symbolizes the people Israel: There are two husks (qelippin), green and white, for the husks of the nut, one is tohu, the green line, while the second is bohu, polished stones,62 a strong husk, like a polished stone. These correspond to the two husks, the chaff and straw of the wheat. The third, thin husk, corresponds to the bran that clings to the wheat and must be ground in a mill to separate it, like the grinding of a man's mouth. So one must savor the words of the Torah, sifting the impurities, the bran, through his lips until he determines the haZakhah, the fine flour.63 This motif of sifting wheat originates in the tradition of chaos as the underlying theme of reality. Tiqqunei ha-Zohar draws on the rabbinic tradition that the instrument of the fall, the \"fruit,\" was a kernel of wheat. The tithe I].allah, the appor-tionment of dough to the Temple, atones for the fall. Therefore it is incumbent on women, who must necessarily atone for Eve's complicity in the fall: \"For her sake Adam, the I].allah of the world, died. So she must take I].allah out of her dough, for it is her drop of seed that she returns to Adam.\"64 Because the fall is sexual in nature, the chaff and straw of the wheat are compared to the foreskin, in that each serves the demonic qelippah's functions and purposes.65 Each motif re-quires the peeling away of barriers to the Divine. Tiqqunei ha-Zohar understands entrance into the covenant of circumcision as transition from the realm of the demonic into that of the holy.66 The removal of the demonic detritus leaves the \"sign of the covenant,\" which takes its place together with the Sabbath and the mezuzah as windows into the realm of the higher sefirotY The tradition that the righteous are often born circumcized underscores the demonic nature of the foreskin.68"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"92 The Enlightened Will Shine The transition from the demonic to the holy is accom-plished through the stripping away of the husk or qelippah inherent in the three actions of circumcision, 'orele, peri'ah, and 'atifu de-dama, the cutting of the foreskin, uncovering the co-rona, and the drawing off of the ensuing flow of blood. 'Orele and peri'ah are synonymous with various demonic pairs: Samael and the serpent, or Rome and Constantinople.69 Each aspect of the act constitutes a bribe for the demonic: \"The flow of blood from the peri'ah will save you from the pressure of the grave, because it gives food to the murderer, sixteen sword edges for the sword of the Blessed Holy One for milah, peri'ah, me~i~a, and the thirteen covenants. \"70 These layers of qelippah are likened to the three shells of the egoz, the classical expression of the hiddenness of the Di-vine. Circumcision is a transition from demonic triunity to redemptive quatemity, which is symbolized by the sign of the covenant: \"The membrum virile has three coverings, like the shells of the nut, tohu va-vohu [primordial chaos] ... the first qelippah: vohu ... the second qelippah, and hoshekh [darkness], the third qelippah, as it says: 'One does not explain matters of illicit sexuality in groups of three.' \"71 After the circumcision, the foreskin is hidden in a pile of earth, with this explanation: Rabbi Eliezer said, \"Father, what is the secret meaning of the covenant, in that we bury the foreskin in a vessel of earth?\" He said to him, \"My son, I once asked the same thing of Elijah [the prophet] .... He told me that the foreskin is the spouse of the primordial serpent that brought death to Adam and to all creation, so we prepare it a vessel of earth, which is its sustenance, as it says: The serpent's bread is dust (Isaiah 65:25). So it separates from human beings ... and this dust is like the dust of the altar, of which it says: Make me an altar of earth (Exodus 20:24).\"72 In societal terms, circumcision symbolizes the eventual stripping away of the lower, debased dimension of the cov-enant.

The Blessed Holy One gathers all His hosts and is revealed, truly removing that foreskin above from the covenant of the holy pillar. All the actions of Israel below arouse an action above, so at that time, the foreskin is removed from all the holy people from above. 73 Like the blood offered in sacrifice,74 the blood of circumci-sion unifies the adherent with the highest levels of the Divine, saving the adherent from the Angel of Death.75 Circumcision is a metaphor for an eschatological understanding of the trans-formation of the nature of Divine law and religious experience. The maskil must strip away the barriers to perception, clarify-ing the legalists' obfuscations by stripping away the corporeal shells that obscure the Divine. The symbolism of circumcision is not arbitrary. The membrum virile, the point at which being is passed on, is marked with the sign of the revelation of God. Theurgy and the Anthropos In the deepest recesses of the lohar's esotericism lies the the ancient notion of God the anthropos, with the human literally created in the Divine image. The texts in the lohar that delin-eate the anthropomorphic structure of the Divine are the most theologically brazen, and they provide the key to understand-ing many oblique loharic exegeses. The editors of the classical editions of the lohar showed great discretion with regard to this tradition and were apt to append lengthy disclaimers and apologies to it.76 The [drat, those passages of the lohar that boldly delin-eate the secrets of the Divine anthropos, are saturated with messianic longing.77 Both modem scholars and Lurianic theo-rists considered them to be the culminating texts of the lohar."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"94 The Enlightened Will Shine One may trace the interactions of thirteenth-century kabbalists according to their awareness of the [drat; the systematic presen-tations of Cordovero and Luria are likewise much indebted to those texts. Both Scholem and Tishby considered the [drat a catalyst for Moshe de Leon's creative muse.78 Yehuda Liebes has qualified the image of the main part of the Zohar as the work of a single author, yet he too has demonstrated the devel-opment of the [drat to be the central preoccupation of the same circles that produced the Zohar.79 The [drat are suffused with the realization of ultimate metaphysical truths, not least be-cause they end with the ecstatic deaths of several of the adepts of Shimon Bar Yol)ai's circle. The Tiqqunim, as well, are preoc-cupied with the [drat, in which the interplay of the sefirat corre-sponds to the contours of a Divine anthropos. The paradigm for the most transcendent levels of Divinity is the primordial man, Adam Qadmon. This anthropos serves as a metaphor for God, the Cosmos, the Torah,80 and by associa-tion, the Temple and its sacrificial cult.81 Tiqqunei ha-Zohar in-terprets the anthropos teachings as forming a response to humankind's present dilemma. Interaction with the Divine is possible through projecting the Divine anthropos onto the hu-man model. Specific rituals begin this transformation and re-pair the wounded body of the universe. The anthropos paradigm expresses the hierarchical na-ture of the sefirat. It also illustrates the dichotomy of the body and the soul, for transition down the sefirotic hierarchy re-quires a similarly radical transition from dimension to dimen-sion.82 This same relationship is a paradigm for the effluence of Divinity into the corporeal world.83 Contemplative mystical ex-perience, in introspective withdrawal into the soul, is the me-dium for ascent into the highest dimensions of the universe:84 \"R. Eliezer said, 'Father, how is man made in the Divine image, for we have heard many opinions?' He said to him, 'My son, when all the sefirat were made they were included in the image of the soul, and the soul was their vehicle.' 1185 The soul's levels mirror the levels of religious expression.

Sacrifice The Zohar,98 Tiqqunim, and Ra'aya Meheimna portray sacrifice as the most profound theurgic act in the synchrony of the anthropomorphic images of God, the universe, and the adept. Temple sacrifices are an overt exchange of spiritual energy. The immolation of the animal's body processes and cycles Divine and demonic energies.

The Tabernacle itself was an earthly microcosm of the universe; to ponder its constituent elements was to ponder the divine superstructure.99 Moreover, the structure of the Temple also conforms to the microcosm of the Divine body.lOO Every aspect of the Temple's function, such as the priestly blessings and duties or the Levitical night watches, is portrayed in terms of its metaphysical dimensions.101 The soteric function of the Temple sacrifices is explained in terms of the interaction of the sefirot.102 Sin causes a rupture in the Divine body, which is assuaged by the body of the sacrifice. The immolation of the sacrificial animal redeems the limbs of the human body. This action links the worshipper to the limbs of the Shekhinah,103 for \"sacrifices atone for a person's limbs, according to the sins that are contingent on that limb.\"104 The grandeur of the cult is portrayed in mythic terms: In the future the Blessed Holy One will unsheath the sun, the righteous will be healed with it. A fiery lion will come from the Throne of Judgment to consume the sacrifices. These are assigned to each limb with which one sins, each a nemesis, as had been taught \"he who does one sin acquires one nem-esis. \"105 When this Divine fire comes down and ignites those limbs and fats and descends like a fiery lion, it will ignite the demons that are assigned to them, and absolve the sins of Israel, the limbs of the Shekhinah.106 The sacrifice is the point of interaction between the lower sefirot and the mundane realm. Trangressions remove the sin-ner from the natural order, but sacrifice returns him, satiating the four beasts and deflecting their destructive proclivities.107 With these beasts mollified, the energies of the sacrifice can ascend into the higher realms of the Divine.

When a person sins with one of the four elements, it is as if he sinned with his soul. So it is written: When he sins in a soul (Numbers 6:11). At that time, the water separates from the fire, the wind from the dust. From the dust come seeds to sustain man, from the water come the animals that sustain the lion, from fire come the grazing animals to sustain the ox, and from wind come birds that sustain the eagle. When a person sins, these elements separate violently. The name of God departs and is replaced by the evil inclination, Samael, Satan. God does not dwell in separation, as it says: They divided their hearts and they will be guilty (Hosea 10:2). Sacri-fices must come from that aspect with which they sinned, to unify108 the four elements that have been separated. When they reunify, the Blessed Holy One descends upon them and Satan flees, rather than be immolated in the sacrificial fire. 109 The Zohar and Tiqqunim clarified the Torah's bewilder-ing differentiation of the sacrifices. The korban oIeh ve-yored, or the \"rising and descending sacrifice,\"llo follows the de-scent of the higher Shekhinah to the lower. As these two aspects of the Shekhinah unite, the practitioner is included in their union. This movement equates the transformative as-pect of the Divine feminine, Imma 'Ila'ah, the \"highest Mother,\" with the elementary, erotic, and unitive aspect.111 The sacrifices reassume their primitive identity as God's food; their immolation, like the song of the Levites, evokes the ascent to the Divine.ll2 Various sacrificial traditions have different theurgic func-tions. The burnt offering, 'oIah, represents the quality of mercy, which catalyzes and dissipates the force of Judgment through the sin offering.ll3 The menorah evokes the Shekhinah as an instrument of unification.1l4 Every sacrifice has an aspect that may be devoted to the realm of the demonic.ll5 Some sacrifices, such as the guilt offer-ing, are clearly a bribe to the demonic.1l6 MinQah, the humble grain offering, is specifically brought to \"break the anger of Samael.\"!17 The temidim, or ongoing regimen of sacrifices, represent the constancy of God.

Sacrificial slaughter must take place at the north side of the Temple, because the qualities of Divine Judgment are associated with the north.119 The laws attending the slaughter are reinterpreted kabbalistically so that such re-petitive formulas as the twelve examinations of the knife,l20 or the five disqualifications in the act of slaughter,l21 are imbued with metaphysical significance. Ritual slaughter is also a metaphor for human death.122 Fish and locusts, which do not require slaughter, are reincarnated scholars. At their deaths, these spiritual elect are simply gathered to the Di-vine, as fish are killed by merely being gathered into the fisherman's net. They never feel the knife of Divine Judg-ment, the untimely cessation of their lives by virtue of their accumulated sins.123 The Zohar contains many statements regarding the proper kavvanah or intention attendant upon sacrifices.124 The author of the Tiqqunim goes further, reinterpreting the Maimonidean critique of the cult, which implies that the physical sacrifice is to be transcended in a more enlightened age.125 Tiqqunei ha-Zohar and Ra'aya Meheimna portray this transcendence in terms of a hierarchy of intentions based on the development of the sacrificer's consciousness. The flawed practice of the ignorant is merely a bribe for the demonic, while the simple pietists can offer only their prayers and good deeds. The maskilim offer their esoteric practice as a sacrifice.126 This typology makes an implicit critique of those who \"consume\" the Torah at the level of simple (peshat) exegesis.127 The individual gives his or her essence to God, and it is altogether clear that some essences are intrinSically superior to others."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"100 The Enlightened Will Shine Sacrificial Organs The limbs are sealed in the secret of sacrifice ... -Zohar III 235b Bodies not only reflect the glory their souls receive in God's presence but are also the place where persons are rewarded and punished in their specificity ... -Caroline Bynum128 The association of the mi-?Vot with the sacrifice extends to the effects on the adept's spiritual and physical bodies. The animal's organs are counterparts of organs in the Divine anthropos as well as the organs that are nourished or abused by the practice or abrogation of the mi-?Vot. This comparison of the elements of the sacrificial body and the Divine body makes extensive use of medieval theories of medicine, elevated to an esoteric level. The sacrifice is a cathartic moment of unification between the worshipper's body and the Divine anthropos. It restores and sanctifies the limbs that have been damaged through sin. There is a radical implication that the sacrifice empowers the dormant strength of the Divine body.lz9 The Divine anthropos circulates holy and demonic ener-gies in the same way that the body circulates air and fluids. The sefirot are also understood as conduits for this exchange of energies. The lungs are the conduit for the rual;, or spirit, the seat of existence.

If they are worthy, the lion descends to eat the sacrifice, and if they are not [worthy] a dog descends. Where? Onto the liver and the bile, Geihinnom, the leech with two daughters, crying \"Give!

The liver is Samael, the bile is its poison. When the bile rules the veins and they are overcome with sin, it says of them: They came to Marah and were unable to drink the waters, for they were bitter (Exodus 15:23). At that time the veins of the heart are blocked, like Noah, his wife, children, animals, beasts, and birds hid-den in the ark. And the heart is blocked, for if the bile ex-tends to the heart, one immediately dies. The bile cannot overcome Israel, who are the heart, except through sin. If they repent, taking on the pure soul of the highest Shekhinah, the heart and its arteries are saved, as it says: And the waters were sweetened (ibid.).138 These organs are symbolized by members of the patriar-chal family, which themselves relate to various sefirot: The liver is Esau, Edom, gathering all the blood, clear or murky, not distinguishing or separating good and bad. The heart is Israel, which distinguishes between good and evil, between pure blood and impure blood, taking only the clearest and cleanest, as one who separates food from waste.!39 After the heart, Jacob, takes the purest blood above, then the liver, Esau, is left with the refuse, which angers him.

It lights torches in the veins of the liver, threatening to envelope the whole body, like the angry sea, whose waves rise to heaven, threatening to break their bounds and shatter the world ... 141 A particularly cathartic role is assigned to the spleen, bile, and liver as receptacles for demonic detritus. For example, the demonic quality of the guilt offering is discernible in the liver, which is \"dirty with the sins of Israel,\"142 and the spleen.143 A characteristic object of these meditations is the demonization of the sirkhot, or lesions on the lungs: Like the sirkhot, which impede the lungs from inflating, so the sins of Israel fuse with the wings of the Shekhinah that are the beasts of the throne, so that they cannot rise on the merits of Israel to the Blessed Holy One. They detain her and weigh on her wings, each beast weighed with these sins.144 The guilt offering is the mother of the mixed multitude, sirkhah, holding on to the throne of the Matronita, forbidding her to escape from exile.

By inhibiting the breathing capacity, the sirkhot actually inhibit the flow of the Divine channels: \"Negative commandments are like refuse, like birds caught in a trap, like the sirkhot that do not allow the folds of the lungs to move.\"148 Tiqqunei ha-Zohar counts eighteen possible sirkhot, a num-bering that entered subsequent exoteric halakhah.149 Whether"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"The Theurgic Dimension of the Commandments 103 or not this understanding originated with the author of the Tiqqunim, it subsequently affected Rabbi Joseph Caro's seminal commentary Beit Yosef 150 in its counting of eighteen sirkhot.

Although this issue awaits definitive analysis, it may provide an example of a kabbalistic imposition on halakhah. Lulav and Etrog Four species of vegetation are brought to the worship service on the Sukkot holiday: the myrtle, willow, palm shoot, and citron.l5l The Tiqqunim and Ra'aya Meheimna interpret in terms of the Divine anthropos. The anthropomorphic metaphor is presented in terms of the rabbinic character of this mi?Vah: The etrog is the Shekhinah, the heart, the essence of the limbs of the body, which are the myrtle, the palm and the two willow branches. The heart is in the center, and the rest of the limbs surround it. Because of thiS, the etrog is the Shekhinah, as the Masters of the Mishnah taught:152 ifits stem has been removed, or if it has been blemished, it is unfit. For it must be like the Shekhinah, of whom it says: You are com-pletely beautiful, my bride, there is no blemish in you (Song of Songs 4:7). The palm branches, that is the lulav, of which it says:153 If the leaves have split off, it is unfit. This is cutting the shoots, for isn't the lulav the knot that binds all? Whoever blesses it on the first day of Sukkot, it is the knot of unity of everything, Ifai olamiml54 for the eighteen vertebrae in the spine. Therefore the Masters of the Mishnah taught: the lulav resembles the spine. The secret meaning of the lulav is (Psalms 92:13) the righteous shall flourish like a palm. 155 The act of gathering all the species involves the ingather-ing of all the forces of the cosmic anthropos. This is particu-larly the case when the adherent prays with the lulav:"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"104 The Enlightened Will Shine One must shake [the lulav] eighteen times in six directions: He sealed the east in YH\"V. ...

Three myrtles, the body and the two arms, corresponding to the eye and the two eyelids. Two willow branches, corresponding to the two thighs, and the two lips. When they are brought together with the palm, the backbone ... they make up the four species of the Divine Chariot, with YHVH riding on them.Is8 The myrtle has a triune nature, which invokes the three Patriarchs, paradigms of the intermediate sefirot Ijesed, Din, and Tif'eret. The two willow branches invoke Ne~1) and Hod. The palm shoot, or lulav, symbolizes Tif'eret, whereas the etrog, or citron, symbolizes Malkhut. Holding the lulav and etrog to-gether is an act of unification, symbolizing the union of the transcendent and the corporeal. The lulav is shaken eighteen times.1S9 This action, like the eighteen blessings of prayer, relates to the eighteen vertebrae of the backbone.16o Because the lulav is symbolic of the Divine backbone, any fracture in its structure renders it unfit for use. Such a fracture parallels that of gnostiC heresy through the images of ki~~u~ and perud, rupture and separation.161 The lulav and petitional prayer are ways of meditatively imaging the Divine. The anthropomorphic hierarchy of the sefirot is in-voked in the Divine names that describe them: For all blessings, one must bow with the eighteen vertebrae, as the Masters of the Mishnah established, with until all the vertebrae of the spine bend.162 This is for the eighteen blessings that are included in the eighteen worlds.

The sukkah itself represents the sanctified inner realm of the holy. The lulav and etrog are instruments of the adherent's union with the supernal dimensions of the anthropos. In Tiqqunei ha-Zohar and Ra'aya Meheimna, the halakhah provides nuances for the illumination of the theurgic act. The Temple cult's importance only magnifies the desola-tion wrought in its loss, so that a gnawing eschatological pa-thos haunts these theurgic mysteries. In light of the eventual absence of the sacrificial cult and its soteric effects, this practice is important, placing social pressure on the maskilim, whose practice is conducted at the highest level. Certain rituals have the esoteric function of unifying the Divine anthropos and, thence, of repairing the damage wrought by the chaotic nature of existence. The Sabbath, especially, provides a respite from this same struggle, and its palliative effects extend over the entire week.

Other mi~ot protect the individual from ma-levolent or demonic forces.

Medieval Jewish philosophers identified the consciousness of God's unity, mi~at ha-yi1).ud, as a specific commandment of the Torah. To have this consciousness might be an actual act of \"unification,\" or it might be merely a kawanah or intention to be assumed in the course of one's practice. In the Tiqqunim, unification with the Divine is a positive act that takes place through the contemplative practice of certain mi~ot. The Sabbath The Zohar displays a subtle understanding of the metaphysical rhythms of time. The cycles of the day, week, and year are por-trayed as a garment for the unfolding of the Divine effluence. The continuum of time is a step down from the unchanging essence of the supernal Godhead.1 The charged metaphysical 107"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"108 The Enlightened Will Shine nature of the Sabbath is reflected in the halakhic strictures that attend its observance.2 The Sabbath is a day free of creation, the day that \"the Shekhinah is freed from her exile.\"3 Hence, its prohibitions derive from withdrawal from constructive actions.4 Tiqqunei ha-Zohar emphasizes the theurgic aspects of the thirty-nine actions forbidden on the Sabbath. These actions derive directly from the catastrophe of the fall, as they encom-pass the curses made upon Adam at the expulsion from Eden: \"When the dewS reigns, the sages forbade the thirty-nine for-bidden actions, which are called avot melakhot,6 corresponding to the Patriarchs on whom reigns the dew which is thirty-nine. Of these thirty-nine actions, ten were inflicted on Adam, ten on Eve, ten on the serpent, and nine on the land. Since this dew already reigns on the Sabbath, no lashes are administered on the Sabbath.\"7 Because the halakhah defined these actions as paradig-matic acts of creation, they are essential to corporeal existence. On the Sabbath, when the Divine effluence flows directly into the corporeal world, one must refrain from them. Refraining from these actions reflects the Shekhinah's tranquility on the Sabbath day. On the Sabbath, humankind has no complaint with the state of creation, so that one is forbidden to interfere with it: \"Wherever Israel are, they are protected and tranquil. Therefore it is forbidden to plow the earth and to make fur-rows, for it is like a blemish in the Holy Land, the Shekhinah. Therefore it is forbidden to use agricultural tools on the Sab-bath, even to carry a stone ... \"8 A central metaphysical difference between the Sabbath and the rest of the week is that, on the Sabbath, the demonic is forbidden from going about its mischief. This freedom from the actions of the demonic brings about various changes in the liturgy and in the adept's behavior.9 According to Tiqqunei ha-Zohar and Ra'aya Meheimna, this change in world-view creates the salient dynamic of the Sabbath mentality, shinnui, the chang-ing of one's activity. Tiqqunei ha-Zohar presents a lengthy homily on the Sab-bath. This sermon combines pietistic exhortations with an eso-teric doctrine of the Sabbath's inner nature:"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Agencies of Unification: The Sabbath and Prayer 109 To observe the Sabbath, it must be changed from the days of the week, in one's clothing, food, and other delights. One who customarily eats two meals on the weekdays should eat three on the Sabbath, as it says: Eat it today, for today is the Sabbath to God; you will not find it in the field (Exodus 16:25). In all things, one should make an addition for the Sabbath. One who customarily has wine and bread on the weekdays should add meat as a Sabbath addition. Change of action, so that if one customarily behaves in a secular way, he should not do so on the Sabbath .... Change of name, for every day is called action, as it says: the six days of action (Ezekiel 46:1). But the seventh day is called the Sabbath, the negation of action. Change of place, that if one customarily lit a lamp on weekdays, he would change and not light it on the Sabbath, as it says: Do not light fire in all your dwellings on the Sabbath day (Exodus 35:3).10 Sabbath's dynamic of change has an underlying meta-physical rationale. On that day, the Shekhinah transforms from the elementary paradigm of the feminine to the transforma-tive persona, the royal Matronita: One must change from the servant to the Matronita, that they not be equal. For the Matronita is the place of the Blessed Holy One. She must become royal, as it says: She was there with her maidservants (Esther 2:9) on the Sabbath. Moreover in your dwellings: a person's dwelling is his place. Also, Change of place, to prepare one's house for the Sabbath more than on the weekday.

According to this well-known mo-tif, sexual intercourse, on the Sabbath eve, evokes the union of the Shekhinah and Tif'eret that takes place in the cosmic realm: If a couple have had a dispute on the weekday, let them have peace on the Sabbath, that one not draw near to the elixir of death, the harlot, or to her husband, the pagan deity, the profanation of the Sabbath.

And if he customarily said the blessing for the bread over one loaf, let him add a second, like the second loaf [of the altar]. If he customarily argued with his wife on the weekdays, on the Sabbath let them have relations in peace. Therefore, the sexual duties of the sages are weekly, from Sabbath eve to Sabbath eve.13 The marital relationship is only a metaphor for the sage's primary relationship, which is with the Shekhinah: \"One must differentiate the Sabbath from the week in all respects. If one is peaceful on all the days of the week, he should be all the more so on the Sabbath, conciliating her with great love, as it says with regard to the Shekhinah: Open to me my sister, my bride, my dove, my innocent (Song of Songs 5:2). With extra words of con-ciliation such as these a man placates his wife on the Sabbath. II 14 The changes that accompany the Sabbath reflect the tra-vails of the Divine, the distension and exile that attend its emanation into the present world. A similar change is con-nected to the invocation of the Divine name. During prayer, that name is never pronounced audibly according the inef-fable letters YHVH. The Divine name enters present reality only in secular fashion, with the euphemism Adonay. The separate essence of the name is comparable to the transformations of consciousness that accompany the Sabbath: Three upheavals: changing one's place, name, and action. Changing one's place, like the Blessed Holy One, of whom it says: Behold, the Lord will go out of His place (Isaiah 26:21). When the Lord comes out, He changes from judgment to mercy and from mercy to judgment so the Masters of the Mishnah taught: Not as I am written am I said.15 In the world-to-come it will be written YHVH and pronounced YHVH. In this world, it is written YHVH and pronounced ADNY. This is change of place, for it is apart from its place that is the world-to-come.

Change of action is the Sabbath, for all actions must be done with the back of the hand.16 Yad [hand] is the ?addik, alJar (back) is the Shekhinah, and this is change of action.l? The dynamic of change is a metaphor for two states of the human condition: the exile and imprisonment of the soul in the corporeal body and the transformed essence of the Divine in the corporeal world. Change is also an underlying aspect of the scholar's exile and wandering: A man whom the Blessed Holy One has troubled with rein-carnation, who has no success, let him be taken out of his place and put in another place, changing his place. This is the secret meaning of: He will take other earth and plaster the house (Leviticus 14:45), and this is change of place. When he sees that he is unsuccessful, he will break down the house, its stones, and its beams (ibid.). He is grafted into another body, as one might graft an apple tree onto a quince tree, chang-ing the tree and its fruit; this is changing the name .18 The idealized and beatific nature of the Sabbath empha-sizes only the benighted quality of the scholar's existence. Ac-cording to the classical rabbinic and Zoharic teaching, the Sabbath is a context for the indwelling of the Divine. This indwelling of the Divine was also present in the maskil's con-sciousness. The Sabbath comes to remedy the situation of the maskil by expediting this transformation of mentality. The Sabbath Table The Sabbath meal is a rite of great spiritual power in the Jewish tradition and was the focus of much interest in the theosophical Kabbalah. The meal is a ritual of unification, for the prayers and rites that attend the meal reflect the interac-tion of the sefirot, their ascent, descent, and union. These ritu-"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"112 The Enlightened Will Shine als, from the handwashing to the grace after the meals, unify the upper and lower sefirot. Every halakhic aspect of the meal is invested with theurgic significance. Esoteric underpinnings for the various aspects of the meal include the breaking of the bread, handwashing, the \"cup of blessing,\" Torah study at the meal, the inclusion of the poor at the table, the avoidance of gluttony, the second handwashing at the end of the meal, the benediction over a cup of wine, and the minimum amount for the cup and the meal.19 The Ra'aya Meheimna and Tiqqunim develop the rabbinic motif of the Sabbath table as a paradigm of the Temple altar:20 The cup has ten requirements,21 as the Rabbis of the Mishnah taught, like the sum of yud from yesod, and they are crown-ing [in a beautiful cup], covering the table, immersion, rins-ing, freshness, fullness, being taken with both hands, placed in the right, being contemplated and raised from the ground one handbreadth. These are a gift to all of the household. Crowning is from the crown of the holy covenant; covering like: He wears light as a cloak (Psalms 104:2), immersion and rinsing, immersion from without, rinsing from within, the secret meaning of: They will be purified and made holy (Leviticus 16:19).22 As the act of slaughter releases the animal for consump-tion, so the benedictions over the meal similarly release the food for consumption. Therefore, food eaten without a benedic-tion is like meat unfit for consumption.23 The rabbinic dictum, ba'al ha-bayit bo.~e'a ve-oreal] mevarekh, \"The householder breaks the bread and the guest says the blessing,\"24 is interpreted in terms of the interaction of the sefirot. The householder represents the intermediate sefirah Malkhut, whereas the guest is the sefirah Yesod, which mediates union with the Shekhinah. Besides the sexual union of the adept with his spouse, the interactions of society facilitate the Divine union on Friday nighU5 Inviting guests to the meal is an act of unification. Both actions reflect the sexual union of the Shekhinah with the Godhead:"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Agencies of Unification: The Sabbath and Prayer 113 The Masters have taught: the breaker of bread is not allowed to eat until the members of the meal have answered amen, and they are not allowed to eat until he has. When the master of the house breaks the bread for those at the meal, not everyone has the same amount, for he need not divide equally. Sometimes he gives this one an olive-weight, or an-other an egg-weight. When they answer amen before the mas-ter of the house, they combine the two requisite amounts as one, an olive-weight or a egg-weight, that is YAHDVNHy.26 The motif of sexual union underlies the esoteric meaning of the two loaves of bread on the Sabbath table.27 The term bo{ea is a likely euphemism for the sexual act, whereas the bread itself also symbolizes the Shekhinah.28 Even the crumbs are meaningful, as the minimum number of crumbs which make up the requirement of a blessing is ten, like the ten sefirot.29 Hence, the meal is an act of unification of the sefirot Tiferet and Malkhut through the medium of Yesod. The equation of Sabbath hospitality with marital rela-tions resolves the dilemma of those Sabbaths in which marital relations are impossible due to the interference of menstrual impurity. Hosting guests is a substitute act of unification, so that no Sabbath may pass without the mystic's commemora-tive act of unification. In another exploration of the sexual metaphor, careless behavior at the Sabbath table is as heinous as sexual trans-gression: Whoever wastes morsels of bread, throwing them into an improper place, is like one who wastes the morsels of the brain, the drops of seed, throwing them upon the earth, of them it says: For all flesh has corrupted its way upon the earth (Genesis 6: 13). Such is the case whether he scattered them in a menstruous woman, a gentile, a maidservant, or a prosti-tute, and all the more so one who scatters the morsels of the bread of Torah, which are the jots and crowns ... 30 The sacraments of the altar and the Sabbath table are all performed with wine, because wine has two facets, white and"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"114 The Enlightened Will Shine red, representing the sefirot Ratzamim and Din.31 This dual na-ture symbolizes the Sabbath mandates of remembrance and observance.32 The wine is charged with metaphysical energies that themselves manipulate esoteric forces: Wine will gladden a man's heart (Psalms 104:15). This is the wine of Torah, as the coefficient (gematria) of \"wine\" (yayin) is \"secret\" (sod ).33 Just as wine has to be sealed and hidden, lest it be offered for idolatry, so the hidden secret Torah must be sealed, only drunk by those who are in awe of her. Hence there are many commandments regarding wine, for with it one blesses the Blessed Holy One. Wine has two colors, white and red, Din and RafJamim, for its two aspects, like the crocus, white and red, white from the realm of the right, red from the realm of the left ... 34 As a result of this dual nature, wine may be employed for the demonic. Yayin nesekh, wine used for gentile sacraments, has taken on this demonic quality. Hence the stricture that the cup of sanctification must be rinsed and purified.35 Rinsing the inside of the cup invokes the rabbinic trope tokho ke-varo, \"con-sistent within and without,\" suggesting that the inner nature of the adept should be consistent with his comportment. 36 The Two Domains In Tiqqunei ha-Zohar, the Sabbath prohibition of carrying from reshut ha-yatzid (a private domain) to reshut ha-rabbim (the pub-lic domain) is a metaphor for the defilement of the holy when it is brought into the realm of the demonicY Rabbinic prohibi-tions against carrying items into or within the public domain guard against such metaphysical ruptures. God's private do-main is the Sabbath, so that planting, uprooting, and carrying on that day are all aspects of the violation of the day's sacred-ness.38 The secular banality that characterizes the public thor-oughfare is also detrimental to the adept's practice. This is explained in this interpretation of the first statement of the Mishnah regarding the Sabbath: Ye?i'ot be-Shabbat shetayim,39 these are picking up and putting down in one action. One who takes something from its place"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Agencies of Unification: The Sabbath and Prayer 115 and leaves it elsewhere has uprooted the Tree of Life, the sign of the covenant, and placed it in a foreign domain. Whoever does this uproots a soul from one realm to another, that of the bile and the spleen. This causes the uprooting of Israel from the holy land to a foreign domain, reshut ha-rabbim,40 as one who took his holy covenant into a foreign domainY The very term rabbim means, simultaneously, \"the many\" or \"the public\" and, in the spirit of the author's ongoing social critique, \"the rabbis.\" The venture into the public thoroughfare is equated with entering the jurisdiction of the halakhic au-thorities.42 Moreover, placing the covenant in a foreign domain is a reference to forbidden sexual relations, so that many forms of transgression are invoked in this image. When the demonic is invoked, it is often in a welter of kinnuyim , as if opening the door to one image lets in a flood of attendant shades and demons. The demonic aspect of the pub-lic thoroughfare is characterized with many mythic images: As much as one must guard the covenant, never taking it into a foreign domain43 so one must guard the Sabbath, not taking [an object] from the private domain into the public domain. The private domain's width is four cubits, and they are YHVH, and its height is ten cubits and they are YU\"O HilA VAV HilA. The public domain is the serpent, whore, elixir of a pagan deity, which is Samael. It is the essence of the seventy nations, the profaned harlot. Her mate is the profanation of the Sabbath. Therefore, one who takes from the private to the public domain is liable for stoning. The 'eruv (Sabbath boundary) is the central pillar, in which one may carry from house to house, the higher and lower Shekhinah ... 44 The adept carries various apotropaic signs into the chaos of the public thoroughfare: the circumcision, tefillin, and the Sabbath itself. Notwithstanding these protections, leaving the inner precincts of the Sabbath for the demonic public thor-oughfare has many risks: The Sabbath is the sign of the covenant of circumcision, the sign of the tefillin. Whoever profanes one, it is as if he pro-"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"116 The Enlightened Will Shine fanes the other. The tefillin of the head are for Remember [the Sabbath day] and the tefillin of the hand are for Observe [the Sabbath day]. As the public thoroughfare is the desecration of the Sabbath, so the sign of the covenant has the prostitute as its desecration, the foreign thoroughfare.45 The public thoroughfare has a quality of sexual illicitness46 and is equated, perhaps realistically, with the prostitute, in this case the debased and demonic aspect of the ShekhinahY Mas-turbation and coitus interruptus profane the holy by casting seed into the demonic realm.48 Thus, the theme of the two reshuyot is often accompanied by the motif of illicit sexuality: \"Whoever carries out of the private domain and into the public domain, or spills seed from the sign of the holy covenant bring-ing it to a foreign domain, has planted the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. Hence, it says of whoever implants a prosti-tute, a maidservant, a gentile woman or a menstruous woman: You shall make no idol (Exodus 20:4).\"49 Profaning God's name is also a violation of boundaries. The Divine name originates in the transcendent and abstracted upper sefirot. Profanation brings it stillborn into the falsehood and artifice of present reality. In the same way, the 'eruv, or Sabbath boundary, creates a sanctified realm of sacred sym-bols. In the exile, observance of the Sabbath requires with-drawal into such a closed sanctuary, free from the corruptions of secular influence. Defilement of the Sabbath is comparable to the fall, in that each catastrophe is allegorized as blas-phemy and idolatry. 50 The private domain, reshut ha-yal)id, is the sacred realm. The 'eruv, the boundary that creates this domain, is the unify-ing sefirah Tif'eret. The rabbinic dimensions of the private do-main, four cubits and ten handbreadths, represent the four letters YHVH and the ten sefirotY The various boundaries also have different meanings. The 'eruv encompasses all of the up-per sefirot, whereas the mavoi or blind alley includes the lower Shekhinah. These boundaries are represented in the shapes of Hebrew letters: \"An 'eruv, in which one lowers the beam when it exceeds twenty handbreadths,52 is the Yu\"d above the Ka\"f of Keter. Therefore, a blind alley, the lower Shekhinah, measures of"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Agencies of Unification: The Sabbath and Prayer 117 ten handbreadths. One must lower the beam that is the letter vav.\"53 All of these understandings originate in the experience of Sabbath activity. The private, encircled areas, reshut ha-yaIJid, are the sanctified realm. Otherwise, the practitioner is adrift in reshut ha-rabbim. The prohibition of carrying and picking things up bars the adept from interaction with his environment, which evokes the shifting, alienated nature of the exile. The Sabbath observer passes, wraithlike, through the corporeal domain. This alienation from present reality is the didactic goal of the mystic's experience of reshut ha-rabbim. Observance of the Sabbath is a withdrawal into the realm of the sacred. Rather than being a celebration of the wonder of the created world, the holy day is a sanctuary, a refuge from the profane realities of existence. Prayer as Unification In the theosophical Kabbalah, prayer has a soteric function as a vehicle of transformation. Prayer redeems the practitioner at the level of Malkhut.54 Petitional prayer is, therefore, a act of mystical ascent and quest: \"Like the stone flung by a sling, one must direct one's prayer to a known place. One must fling one's thought in prayer to that Crown that is encrusted with gems, of which is says: When bowing, bow at Barukh and straighten at the name, with the name toward which one needs to send it.\"55 The recitation of psalms, when coupled with the act of repentance, takes the place of penitential sacrifice.56 Even the daily petitional prayers are part of this process. In fact, they are its center, for the very nature of blessing is an invocation of the upper sefirot: \"BaRUKH (blessed) is KH'-Keter, R'-Reshit57 Iftkhmah B' the transcendent Mother and the Shekhinah U' 58 for the six sefirot, even ten are included in it and gathered in. \"59 The Tiqqunim interpreted two rabbinic dicta in terms of the theurgic act of unifying the upper and lower sefirot. The talmudic dictum kore'a be-varukh, zoqefba-shem, or \"bow at the blessing, straighten at the Name, \"60 refers to the proper bows to be taken during the recitation of the daily prayer. The adher-ent bows at the word Barukh, literally, \"Blessed,\" and straight-ens up at the recitation of the name of God. Tiqqunei ha-Zohar"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"118 The Enlightened Will Shine stresses the theurgic aspects of bowing and straightening, to indicate the approach, coupling, and union of the upper and lower worlds. The bow directs the descent of the higher aggregate as-pects of the Divine to unification with the lower. The effect is intensified through the release of serpentine energies in the spine, as indicated by the rabbinic admonition that one must continue praying \"even if a serpent is coiled at one's heel.\"61 The act blends the powers of the name YHVH, the energies of the sefirah Tif'eret, with the powers of the audible manifestation of the name Adonai. This action brings the union of Tif'eret with Malkhut: \"When he bows, all the cherubs shelter him with their wings, which is the sekhakh [thatch] of the Sukkah. Zoqef-he straightens with the two names AHYH and YHVH.\"62 The bows of the petitional prayer are true theurgy, in that they invoke the immanent presence of God. The union of these realms is also symbolized in the motif of the matriarch Rebekah's leaning down to empty her water jug, the Hebrew kad. The numerical coefficient of kad is twenty-four, also the number of books in the Bible, implying that Scripture is also a conduit of this immanent Divinity.63 The act of prayer, like the mystical exegesis of Scripture, is an act that brings about unification: liThe twenty-four letters [of the second line of the shema prayer] include the twenty-four books, the kad withdraws from the sea of Torah .... What does this kad draw forth? The Shekhinah, which is the twenty-four books of the Torah.\"64 The prostrations also invoke the dimensional nature of the six intermediate sefirot. They are compared to shaking the lulav, another theurgic act that invokes the flow of the ineffable Divine into corporeal existence: \"These bendings and straightenings demonstrate the principle of back and forth, for He that owns the four winds; up and down for He that owns the heaven and the earth.65 These are the six dimensions: heaven and earth and the four directions ... \"66 This action also invokes the people Israel's role as the support for the vicissitudes of the Shekhinah in her exile. The proper intention or understanding at times of prayer affects the Shekhinah's condition: \"Happy are you, Israel, the feet of the"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Agencies of Unification: The Sabbath and Prayer 119 Shekhinah, when you stand on them in the Amidah prayer, truly standing on them, standing on them in the exile, when YHVH descends on you, as it says: When you straighten, straighten at the Name, for a person must straighten and rise to the Shekhinah. \"67 Straightening invokes the union of the sefirot Malkhut and Tiferet, which is indicated in the combined name YAHDVNHY. This combinations of the names YHVH and ADNY came to be a standard usage in kabbalistic liturgy. In sefirotic terms, the linking of Tif'eret and Malkhut through Yesod channels Divine effluence into the corporeal and returns Divine thought to the ineffable.68 Not surprisingly, this practice is repeated ten times69 in the prayer service. The rabbinic dicta ha-ro-?eh le-hal)kim yadrim, \"he who de-sires wisdom should (tum) south,\" and ha-ro-?eh le-ha'ashir y~pin, \"he who desires wealth should tum north, \"70 refer prayer to-ward different areas in the Temple court. It originated, histori-cally, at the point of transition between cultic sacrifice and personal prayer. Its original application seems to have been as a theurgic addendum to the Temple cult, as the altar's table was located in the north side of the sacrificial area. These dicta went to the heart of a theological problem that preoccupied kabbalistic speculation. The shifting exchanges of energy in the ten sefirot tempted the practitioners to devise prayers that would address specific sefirot. The kabbalists were con cered with whether the adherent could direct prayer toward one sefirah or another. Potentially, this practice was heretical in that it implied divisions in the absolute unity of the sefirot. Because the sefirot were meant to be in union, to visualize a separation in the Divine was gnostic heresy. This direction of energies toward various aspects of the sacrificial cult provides an important precedent for the direction of intention towards specific sefirot: One might ask: Why do we pray to the Blessed Holy One on several levels? Sometimes one prays through a certain sefirah or attribute, sometimes one's prayer is to the right, as it says; ha ro?eh le-hal]kim yadrim, sometimes to the left, which is sig-"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"120 The Enlightened Will Shine nified by ha ro~h le-ha'ashir ya~pin. Sometimes to the central pillar, sometimes to the ~addik. Every prayer goes up to a certain level, but YHVH is truly in every sefirahJI The practicing kabbalist confronted a dilemma. On the one hand, he might perceive that cosmic or social orders were beset by an imbalance in the energies of the sefirot. Due to its theurgic power, his properly directed mystical prayer could cor-rect that imbalance. Yet at the same time, the kabbalist could not direct prayer only toward the sefirah in question. Full inten-tion, during prayer, to a particular sefirah is equivalent to the gnostic heresy of kiHU? ba-neti'ot, \"cutting the shoots,\" the im-aging of divisions, as opposed to unity, in the Divine.72 Such directed prayer, then, could emphasize a certain realm, predi-cated on the understanding that the sefirot as a whole were unified. This directing of prayer is an act of balancing and compensation. In the present case, the direction of prayer does not originate from an ongoing bias on the part of the adher-ent; there are merely different needs for the Shekhinah at differ-ent times: \"Prayer is the Shekhinah. When one asks mercy on the world, she goes on the right, when she has to bring judg-ment on the world she goes to the left, and all of these are for YHVH who is everywhere ... \"73 This paradox of unity and multiplicity makes use of the classical Zoharic preoccupation with the four rivers that flowed out from the Garden of Eden. Just as these rivers all derived from a single source, so the mystic's directed prayers are ab-sorbed by the unified network of the sefirot: \"A river issues from Eden to water the garden and it then divides and becomes four branches (Genesis 2:10) that is lfesed, the right arm. Then he who desires wisdom, let him tum south. The camp of Michael drink from it, with Judah's staff and two tribes. Gevurah is the left arm, so he who desires wealth, let him tum north, the camp of Gavriel drink from it, with the staff of Dan and two tribes ... \"74 This statement compares the multiplicity of the sefirot, which make up the unity of God, with the multiplicity of the tribes and the heavenly host, which also make up the unity of Israel and the cosmos. Kabbalah also contains principles of"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Agencies of Unification: The Sabbath and Prayer 121 balancing and compensation in which the sefirot originate in their opposites. For instance, there is the paradox of the dy-namic, extroverted sefirah fjesed originating in the ineffability of the sefirah Ifokhmah.75 These rabbinic dicta regarding prayer are interpreted by the author of the Tiqqunim in terms of the interaction of the sefirot. In each case, the rabbinic dictum is reduced to the kinnui form, then reinterpreted symbolically. In the case of the bowings and straightenings, this sefirotic interpretation is origi-nal and novel. The dictum concerning directed prayer towards areas of the Temple has a more direct link to the motif of sefirot as aspects of the Divine.

It has been the position of this study that such is not the case with the works of the author of Tiqqunei ha-Zohar and RaJaya Meheimna. Even though the Tiqqunim are, by their own definition, secondary to the lohar, they develop the lohar's mystical world-view in ways that are significant for subsequent Kabbalah. The lohar is the central work of theosophical Kabbalah but the Tiqqunim and RaJaya Meheimna are instrumental in creating a context for the accep-tance of the lohar and the subsequent historical developments of movements of kabbalistic thought. The vocation of the maskil, which Tiqqunei ha-Zohar and RaJaya Meheimna formalized, demanded that the adept emu-late the lohar's contemplative spirituality, particularly the ro-mantic ethic of picaresque religious quest as practiced by Rabbi Shimon Bar Volpi and his disciples. The anonymous kabbalist who wrote Tiqqunei ha-Zohar and RaJaya Meheimna defined this social ethic so that this purportedly Tannaitic life-style could be carried into his contemporary milieu. According to this doc-trine of religious vocation, mystical enlightenment came from 123"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"124 The Enlightened Will Shine the practice of contemplative Torah study, utilizing the sym-bolic hermeneutic that had been crystalizing among the theo-sophical kabbalists. This pietism was not only contemplative; the mystic was socially activist in his struggle to achieve the Zohar's theurgic goals. 1 It is the position of this study that Tiqqunei ha-Zohar and Ra'aya Meheimna also had an important role in the develop-ment of kabbalistic hermeneutics. The author's doctrinal addi-tions to the Zohar's theosophical Kabbalah were critical in shaping the perception of the Zohar by later kabbalists. Subsequent interpretations of the Zohar were also influenced by his doctrinal innovations, which include his understandings of the immanence of God, the emanating structure of the suc-cessive worlds and the relation of Divinity to the kabbalistic symbol, or kinnui. His tendency to \"read\" those doctrines, as well as the conclusions of the Idrot, into preexistent Zoharic texts prefigured the methodology of later exegeses in the Cordovero and Lurianic schools of thought. Every subsequent school, in interpreting the Zohar, was bound to accept the the author's doctrinal innovations and to find them in the earlier strata of the Zohar, just as the Tiqqunim and Ra'aya Meheimna did. The quality of urgency in Jewish history was dramatized in these works' portrayal of the legendary catastrophes of the Pentateuch as continuing to unfold in contemporary history. In this drama of unfolding catastrophe and mythic chaos, the maskil is portrayed as struggling to find meaning for the dilem-mas of humanity. It is not the purpose of this study to trace the resonance of this imagery in subsequent kabbalistic movements. However, it may be assumed that the images of struggle, bro-kenness, and distension emphasized in Lurianic Kabbalah, with such effect in Jewish history, have their seed in the Tiqqunim and Ra'aya Meheimna. The heightened social and soteric roles of the enlightened mystic are portrayed as a fitting continuation of the heroic legend of Shimon Bar Yolpi and his circle. Hence, there is a historical connection between the romanticism of the Zohar, the Tiqqunim, and Ra'aya Meheimna and the the spiritual move-"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Agencies of Unification: The Sabbath and Prayer 125 ments of Safed, Sabbateanism, and Polish J:Iasidism. These later movements sought to continue the spiritual model of the he-roic mystic, whose example and actions are as significant as his teachings. It is the conclusion of this study that the teach-ings of the TIqqunim and RaJaya Meheimna self-consciously at-tempted to expedite this historical process. Therefore, they serve as an important bridge between the Zohar and the develop-ment of subsequent kabbalistic movements. Because the TIqqunim and RaJaya Meheimna came to have such an important historical role, the author's relationship to halakhah requires clarification. Jewish mysticism, in general, developed from the pre-existent, highly contextualized ontol-ogy of rabbinic Judaism. Jewish tradition shaped this kabbalist's expectations; its theological aims limited the parameters of his experiences. The author's use of rabbinic texts as kabbalistic symbols, or kinnuyim, belies the accusation that his attitude towards the halakhah was antinomian. His utilization of rab-binic materials in the kinnui form, combined with his under-standing of the immanent function of the Divine in the chaos of contemporary history, demonstrate that the law and lore of the Talmud are intrinsic to present existence and redemption from its dilemmas. The author's understanding of the ritual and civil laws of Judaism do contain a number of important departures from their nature of biblical and rabbinic origins. TIqqunei ha-Zohar and RaJaya Meheimna utilize the nuances of the dietary and ritual traditions to reinforce the performance of the mi?Vah as a charged act that directly causes change and repair in the Di-vine macrocosm. Such an understanding of the mi?Vot cer-tainly preceded these works in the traditions of the theosophi-cal Kabbalah.2 Nonetheless, TIqqunei ha-Zohar and RaJaya Meheimna judiciously use halakhic material, particularly in their exploration of the mnemonics and repeated principles that so animate talmudic debate. It is true that the TIqqunim and RaJaya Meheimna contain proportionately more rabbinically based ar-guments, and that those arguments draw on a deeper and more theoretical level of halakhic thought than the other parts of the Zohar. This charged use of halakhah was particularly"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"126 The Enlightened Will Shine effective when combined with the anthropomorphic conclu-sions of the [drot. The practices presented in this study are not specific to the maskil; all were basic acts of piety incumbent upon the entire community. The maskil only brings a greater degree of con-sciousness to the action. Inevitably, then, the maskil is fated to lead, as he alone knows the inner meaning of the popular practice. Only the maskil understands the ontological state of the world, particularly the chaotic nature of existence. He is the one most conscious of this level of reality; hence he per-ceives most clearly the demonic nature of those entities that the law considers unclean, unfit, and forbidden. Certainly, the outline of these proscriptions are the contours of the demonic's empirical existence. Consequently, the maskil also understands best the theurgic dimension of the mi?Vot. Preoccupation with the exoteric dimension of the law is seduction into apostasy, for legal casuistries that refine the laws may stray into a voided realm of religious sophistry. So it is that the vocation of the maskil at times overlaps with that of the legalist, but the former is not in full agreement with the latter. There is an essential level of halakhah, in which the legalist and mystic are united by shared purpose. The halakhists' flaw lies in their application of a voided, sophistic casuistry to the essence of the halakhah. This mentality also lent itself to the nihilism of rationalistic philosophy, which was itself the object of numerous polemiCS in the Zohar and works of Moshe de Leon. In the light of this extensive use of the tropes of the law in the Tiqqunim and Ra'aya Meheimna, it is clear that the author distinguishes between the primary binding nature of the com-mandments themselves and the potentially flawed purview of the rabbinical authorities, who he freely criticizes. The author also makes a distinction between halakhah as part of the sym-bolic canon, in which its deeper meaning is implied by aspects of its surface nature, and the empty casuistry of many contem-porary rabbis. There is an inherent skepticism about this hu-man authority, yet a reverence for the essential identity of the Torah and its laws. In this regard, the doctrines of the Torah of"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Agencies of Unification: The Sabbath and Prayer 127 Afilut and Torah of Beriah represent gradations and dimensions of the same Torah, even as the worlds of Afilut and Beriah describe dimensions of the same whole macrocosmos. This understanding of the law's transcendent aspect is also part of the maskil's enlightenment. The same heightened con-sciousness that understands the inner meaning of the sacred text perceives the esoteric dimension of the laws and practices. This is particularly true when the maskil has been initiated into the innermost dimension of the law, the anthropomorphic mys-teries of the Idrot. These traditions provide the maskil with a window into his own soul, through which he gains an under-standing of the innermost nature of existence. This understand-ing creates an almost yogic awareness of the movements of forces across the human body and the Divine macrocosm. The mysterious figure who wrote Tiqqunei ha-Zohar and Ra'aya Meheimna was truly the principal acolyte of the Zohar. By accepting the Zohar as an entity and internalizing it, he created the ethic of subsequent Kabbalah in its most popular, widespread, and historically significant incarnations. Moreover, Tiqqunei ha-Zohar and Ra'aya Meheimna may be read in such a way as to portray a unified view of this mystic's dark and beautiful inner world."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Notes Chapter One Notes 1.

This is a necessary development in kabbalah studies and should provide for a less charged and doctrinal understanding of the lohar's origins. 5. The presence of a characteristic single hand was acknowl-edged by R. Avraham Galante, in the great anthology of lohar commentaries, Or ha-Jfamah I (c. 1550) 159a: \"these are the words of the book's author in the days of the Geonim, or other sages who gathered the articles of R. Abba, R. Shimon Bar Yol).ai's scribe, and divided them according to the readings of the year ... \" 6. Tiqqun is one of the lohar's euphemisms for the sefirot, or Divine hypostases, which are the central organizing principle of clas-sical Kabbalah. The Tiqqunim, in particular, employ this term as an organizing principle of the text's literary form. The term derives from the Arabic UL/, to complete, render firm, construct well\" (Lane, An Arabic-English Lexicon 1:1, p. 309), \"finir, se rendre raison de ... ,\" (R. Dozy, Supplement aux Dictionaries Arabes, p. 149). 7. The idea of seventy faces or aspects to the Torah is a classical rabbinic formulation. See Moshe Idel, \"Infinities of Torah in Kabbalah,\" in Midrash and Literature, ed. Geoffrey H. Hartman and Sanford Budick, (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 155n. 8. A large section from the Tiqqun 70 is included in the main part of the lohar, I 22a-29a. R. Moshe Cordovero, in his commen-tary Or Yaqar (c. 1567) also indicates that the lengthy selection Ta Jfazei (TlI:I 7b, l I 256a-262a) is also \"from the Tiqqunim\" (Or Yaqar III; p. 277). The author of the Tiqqinum also wrote the preface to the romantic composition Saba de-Mishpatim (l II 94a-b) according to Tishby, MhZ I, p. 19n. See also Yehudah Liebes's Peraqim be-Millon Sefer ha-Zohar [Some Chapters in a lohar Lexicon] (Ph.D. disserta-tion, Hebrew University, 1976; Jerusalem: Hebrew University Press, 1982) p. 322. The gloss of the lohar's treatise on physiognomy, Raza de-Razin (II 70a-75a, lI:I 56c-60a) in Zohar Jfadash 31a-35b, seems to be by the author of the Tiqqunim. A composition included in Sefer ha-Malkhut (Paris #841), an anthology of the writings of Joseph of Hamadan, was identified by the late Ephraim Gottlieb as coming from the same hand as Tiqqunei ha-Zohar and Ra'aya Meheimna (\"Shenei I:Iibburim Nosafim le-Rav Yosef ha-Ba mi-Shushan ha-Birah ve-lihui ha-I:Iibburim she-be-'Sefer ha-Malkut' \" [Two Additional Compositions by R.

Joseph Hacker). Gottlieb compiled a number of the author's unpub-lished Hebrew writings. Amos Goldreich of Tel Aviv University has edited a number of these manuscripts, and we hope they will be published imminently. At this time one has been made available, in the essay \"La'az Iberi be-Fragment Bilti-Yadu'a shel Ba'al Tiqqunei ha-lohar\" [Iberian Dialect in an Unknown Fragment from the Author of Tiqqunei ha-lohar], in The Zoharand Its Generation, pp. 89-12l. 9. The extant manuscripts of Tiqqunei ha-Zohar may be di-vided into four \"families.\" The first and largest resembles the printed editions of the Tiqqunim and generally begin at Tl 17 a, with the \"second introduction,\" the famous preamble by Elijah the Prophet, \"Patal') Eliyahu.\" Within this family are a number of smaller group-ings. Some texts omit the first Tiqqun of the Mantua and Orta Koj editions, thereby altering the numbering of all the subsequent Tiqqunim (Cambridge ADD 519, ADD 1833; J.T.S. 1644). Other texts truncate the third Tiqqun (British Museum REG 16A XIV 765 and OR 10701 GS 1398), and still other texts omit Tiqqun 13 (British Museum ADD 27061 782). Some texts append material from Tiqqunei lohar Hadash to the end (Sasson 591, Vatican 200). This Introduction from the printed edition rarely appears (Mousaioff 218, Cambridge ADD 519), although material from it may be scattered throughout the text (Vienna-Reiner 218). This would support the idea that, as in the Mantua edition of the lohar, the introduction is an artificial con-struct included after the assembly of the main material (this is sup-ported by the inclusion of material from the introduction in the Tiqqunei Zohar Hadash of Cordovero's Or Yaqar). Such is also the case with material from the lengthy Tiqqunim 21, 69, and 70, which are shorter in many manuscripts in this family. The material in lohar I, 22a-22a, appears in certain manuscripts in this family, though not always in the same place (Vatican 208, Paris 791). A second family of manuscripts are those texts presently in-cluded in Tiqqunei Zohar Ifadash. These may be presented in a man-ner similar to its published form (Oxford M337-1917, Sasson 27) or according to the format of Cordovero's Or Yaqar. This latter group is particularly important because the texts are very exact yet lacking in many embellishments and interpolations found in the Orts Koj text, to which material has been added. The British Museum manuscript of Or Yaqar (ADD 37060-781, ADD 27061-782, ADD 27063-783 and particularly ADD 27041-784 and ADD 27042-785) contain lohar texts not otherwise found in the printed edition."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"132 Notes A third family of manuscripts is exemplified by Vatican 207 (1489) and British Museum OR 10863-GS 1097. This family seems to bear no resemblance to the structure of the printed edition and makes extensive use of the marginal material included in Tiqqunim 21, 69, and 70. Sometimes the copyist seems to have randomly combined disparate sections, often switching section in midsentence, as if he did not understand what he was writing. At the same time, there is much substitution of Hebrew for Aramaic and other para-phrasing. The fourth family of manuscripts is exemplified by Paris 791. Its most salient feature is that the extra Tiqqunim of Tl 139a-148a are inserted into the text in the vicinity of Tl 38b. This text, or one like it, was used extensively by Reuven Margoliot in the pre-paration of his edition of the Tiqqunim and is responsible for much of the difference between that edition and the standard Orta Koj edition. The lohar project of the Hebrew University, under the director-ship of the late Rivka Shatz, collected some fifty-five manuscripts that were initially listed as Tiqqunei ha-Zohar. Of these, some are really texts of the Idra Rabbah, mislabeled (Firenza 53, J.T.S. 2203, Vatican 226). Other manuscripts contain \"Tiqqunim\", that is, Lurianic devotional practices, but they are also not Tiqqunei ha-Zohar (J.T.S. 1582, 1584, 1650; British Museum OR 10385-GS 238). 10. For example, Tiqqunim 10 and 21 deal largely with the issue of prayer, whereas Tiqqun 67 deals with the sin of Adam. In the lengthy Tiqqunim 69 and 70, the author extends his excurses into later sections of the book of Genesis. Tiqqun 21 (Tl 42b-63a) portrays a somewhat more elaborate setting of the heavenly academy and has a more developed structure than the other Tiqqunim. 11. Scholem, Major Trends, p. 157. 12. See Elliot Wolfson, Introduction to Sefer ha-Rimmon, Chap-ter 4. 13. In the published editions, the text of the Ra'aya Meheimna was broken up and incorporated into the main sections of the lohar, with each extant commandment placed according to the Torah por-tion in which it appears. In the Cremona and Mantua editions of the lohar, the text of the Ra'aya Meheimna was confused with an-other treatise on commandments, Piqqudim, which seems to have been composed by Moshe de Leon. It is possible to reconstruct the structure of the Ra'aya Meheimna with the help of the numbering system of R. Moshe Zakhut (known by"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Notes 133 his acronym as the ReMeZ) and the studies ofE. Gottlieb, \"Ma'amarei ha-'Piqqudim'she-be-Zohar\" [The \"Commandments\" Passages in the Zohar] in MeQqarim be-Sifhlt ha-Kabbalah, pp.224-229. Cordovero's Or Yaqar separates the two treatises, and Cordovero acknowledged their distinction in his Or Ne'erav (3:3, 4:2). The manuscript of Or Yaqar contains observations about the identity of various Zoharic texts. The Cordovero version of Ra'aya Meheimna has recently been published as part of the Or Yaqar commentary. It is regrettable that Reuven Margoliot chose to accept the unity of the two compositions with faith in its Tannaitic origins, in his Ra'aya Meheimna, Sefer Mi~ot [ ... A Book of the Commandments, in the first volume of his edition of the Zohar], after the manner of R. David Luria in his Kadmut Sefer ha-Zohar [The Antiquity of the Zohar] (New York: Nezal]., 1951). The follOwing seem to be the extant texts of the Ra'aya Meheimna: I: 2520, 246b,226a-b II: 41b-43a, 930, 1140-1210, 157b. III: 3b, 16b, 200, 24b, 27a-29b, 330, 340, 420, 67b, 81b-83b, 89b-90a,98a-b, 108b-110b, lIla, 1210-1260, 152b-153b, 1750,2150-2170, 217b-220a, 2220-2390, 2420-2580, 271b, 2740, 274b-283a. Breaking up the main text of the Ra'aya Meheimna did have a negative effect on the coherency of the text, as R. Avraham Galante (Or ha-lfamah II, p. 148b) noted: \"The publishers broke up these commandments and wrote each one in its own place, and their destruction was greater than their building, for the understanding of many issues is contingent on the commandment which precedes them, and this disruption leaves things obscure and out of context.\" 14.

The address of the prophet Elijah, Patal) Eliyahu, which makes up the second introduction to the main text of the Tiqqunim (IZ 17a-b), was incorporated into the daily and pre-Sabbath rite of the Lurianic liturgy. The meditation on the shofar (RM III 98b) is also commonly printed in the Rosh ha-Shanah service of the Sefardic and ljassidic communities. If a work is incorporated into the liturgy, its mere recitation, even without comprehension, is still perceived as having a positive effect. If this liturgical application is equal to Jew-ish canonicity, then the Tiqqunim themselves are canonical. 2. See Gershom Scholem, Origins of the Kabbalah (Princeton, N.J.: Jewish Publication Society and Princeton University Press, 1987), pp.35-48. 3.

The prevalence of erotic metaphor serves only to emphasize a terror of its illicitness. This charged quality may betray a morbid sexual pathology in remarks such as \"a cohen has to take a virgin, because otherwise she's a used cup, since the woman is the cup of blessing\" (RM III 89b). Yehudah Liebes speculates intriguingly on the pOSSibility of sexual dysfunction on the part of the author of the Zohar (\"Ha_ MashiaIJ. shel ha-Zohar,\" pp. 203-205)."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"152 Notes In both the Zohar and the Tiqqunim, there are references to the corrupting and demonic nature of intercourse with a menstruous woman, a maidservant, a gentile woman, or a prostitute (respec-tively, Niddah, Shifl]ah, Goyah, Zonah; acronym Nashgaz). The vehe-mence of these references goes far beyond the degree of mere halakhic or philosophical value structures. They reflect the influence of the Toledano reforms of 1280-1281, in which the Castilian community, under the leadership of Todros Abulafia, imposed social restrictions designed to combat the excesses of Jewish slave owners with their gentile maidservants. This attribution of the archetypal qualities of the demonic to these four examples of forbidden intercourse indi-cates the kabbalistic support for these ethical reforms. (See Baer, A History of the Jews in Christian Spain, vol. 1 pp. 243-305, and \"Ha-Reqa' ha-Histori shel ha-Ra'aya Meheimna,\" pp. 1-44; Goldreich, \"La'az Iberi be-Fragment Bilti-Yadu'a shel Ba'al Tiqqunei ha-Zohar,\" p. 108.) The author of the Tiqqunim continues the Zohar's characteristic ambivalence toward the feminine (TZ 133a). He respects the eco-nomic advantages of married life (TZ 30b, 126b), yet the wife is little more than the body to the husband's \"soul\" (TZ 134a). An unhappy marriage can lead to the total disruption of one's life (TZ 30b, 72a), yet a man is flawed without a wife, abandoned by God (TZI:J 114d). Communication with ones spouse wards off the demonic aspects of feminine sexuality (RM III 276a, see Z II 28). In the manner of the Bahir, marital ruptures, such as divorce or levirate marriage, are seen as metaphors for the chaotic upheavals in the cosmos (TZ 61a-b, 72a; see also Liebes, \"Ha-Masial) she I ha-Zohar,\" p. 203n.). The three guarantees of the marriage contract reflect triunity (TZ 22a-b), while the seven blessings of the wedding service reflect the seven lower sefirot (TZ 84a, see Ketubot, 7b-8a). The author echoes the great biblical literary equation of idola-try with promiscuity (RM III 90a, 11Oa) as well as the Talmud's equation of idolatry with witchcraft. Illicit sexuality is idolatry, hence intercourse during the menstrual cycle is like a sacrifice to idols. These demonic qualities are a classical example of the negative elementary character of the Mother archetype (TZ 69a; see Neumann, The Great Mother, pp. 147-179). 103. I (TZ) 27a. 104.
