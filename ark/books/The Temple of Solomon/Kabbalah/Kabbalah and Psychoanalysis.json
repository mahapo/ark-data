Daniel Wentworth transcribed the tapes of theseseminars. I have added some new material without disturbing theflow of the seminar as it happened. The Appendices stand as a littlebook in itself. I think of how enthralled I was with the appendix toMarion Milner’s On Not Being Able to Paint, which opens dimensionsonly hinted at in the text. That remains as a background model for theimportance of what is added on.Part of the impetus for this work, although I did not suspect itthen, was a spontaneous interchange I had with Wilfred R. Bion in1978, the year before he died. We were speaking, and out of the bluehe asked, “Do you know the Kabbalah, the Zohar?” As far as I wasaware, there was no preparation for this remark. He just said it. I wasa bit taken aback and said, “Well, I know it, but don’t really knowit.”I read bits of Kabbalah since my early twenties and, without consciousawareness, it was part of my lived background from early childhood.I was in my early forties when I met Bion. He quickly said, “I don’teither, really know it,” modestly reassuring me. It was established thatix"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"neither of us were scholars, experts, “knowers”, but had awareness,acquaintance. There was a pause. Then he looked at me and said, “Iuse the Kabbalah as a framework for psychoanalysis.”I said nothing for a while, letting the remark sink in. I remembereda seminar with Joseph Campbell, who used the Kundalini chakras asa framework for Freud and Jung and varied reaches of spiritual life,so, although I was surprised, I was not totally surprised. Yet, hearingBion say this set off ripples. I wondered for years why he said that tome. As far as I have been able to learn so far, I did not hear of himsaying that to anyone else. Why me?A few years later, reading one of his Brazilian seminars, I found apassage in which he spoke about a Jewish patient who devalued hisracial background. He was supervising a case and spoke about thepatient’s attitude as cutting him off from something basic, a font ofpotential richness. This cutting off stifled a basic flow of his being. Iwondered if Bion’s remark about Kabbalah was meant to stimulate,invite, nourish my Jewish soul? Did it imply something about my ownneed to become at-one with a profound source of possibility in mybeing, one I partly disowned, brushed past, neglected? Our conversa-tions accomplished a lot in a short time (Eigen & Govrin, 2007) andsome of what happened took years to bear fruit. This book is one ofthe outcomes, thirty-four years later.I am not a Kabbalah scholar, but aspects of its teachings havebecome part of me, as has psychoanalytic work. The two have manypoints of convergence. The main psychoanalytic writer I use in thiswork is Bion, partly because of his striking statement that he usesKabbalah as a framework for psychoanalysis, but largely because it ishard to miss connections between the two. Both are preoccupied withcatastrophe and faith. Bion calls faith the psychoanalytic attitude. Bothare preoccupied with infinity and intensity of experience. Both arepreoccupied with shatter and the possibility of bearing and growingthe kind of psyche that can work with the dimensions sensitivityopens. Both are preoccupied with ontological implications of theUnknown and the importance of emotional life. Bion, too, writespenetratingly about an ongoing crises of faith, basic to Kabbalahconcerns.As in all of my work, D. W. Winnicott plays an important back-ground role. His writings on vital sparks connect with Kabbalah’sburied divine sparks scattered everywhere. His incommunicado corexPREFACE AND INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"connects with Kabbalah’s Ein Sof, the infinite beyond bounds andconception. For Winnicott, too, faith is important, what I call a para-doxical faith (Eigen, 1998) because it spans and opens diverse dimen-sions without reductively taking sides. Winnicott also writes of theimportance of creative illusion, which adds to richness of living, evenhelps one feel alive. He locates illusion in transitional experiencing,which takes different forms as one grows. It might be that what wecall self is, partly, a transitional state, which, like dolls, games, hobbiesof childhood, lose meaning as one grows. We outgrow self-identitiesonce treasured as new dimensions of experience open and take usforward. Yet, paradoxically, old self-states might deepen when wetouch them with who we are now.The present work is my own exploration supported by manysources. The writing on Rabbi Nachman in Chapter Two draws heav-ily from Arthur Green’s (1992) Tormented Master: The Life and SpiritualQuest of Rabbi Nahman of Bratslav. It is also enriched by RodgerKamenetz’s (2010) Burnt Books: Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav and FranzKafka.The different spellings of Nachman/Nahman are discussed inAppendix 7: “Rabbi Nachman’s paths”. My thanks to Dr Sue Saper-stein for urging me to read the above works by Green and Kamenetz.I list some suggested readings in Appendix 8, in addition to theReferences, but no short list can cover the ground. Some of my mostimportant learnings were from direct exposure to teachers and lifeitself. The Kabbalah is not a unified work, but a loose term that coversan archipelago of possibilities, texts from many times and places andmany personalities one can only imagine. My own life has beentouched by a diversity of spiritual–mystical traditions besidesJudaism, including Buddhist, Taoist, Hindu, Sufi, and Christian. Simi-larly, a host of psychoanalytic and non-analytic influences are impor-tant to me, including Freud, Jung, Adler, Reich, Searles, Elkin, Kohut,Bion, Winnicott, Milner, Lacan, Perls, and various kinds of body work.I would list a host of simpaticocontemporaries, but am in dread ofleaving someone out. I am not an expert in anything, but I am grate-ful to many contacts for opening aspects of reality.For many, a sense of infinity interweaves with everyday life. Theyare part of each other, one reality. This interweaving has been part ofmy life ever since I can remember and helped make my life meaning-ful beyond words. Sometimes, I picture individuals and humankindas a whole as a mansion with many rooms, many of which we mayPREFACE AND INTRODUCTIONxi"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"never enter.

Shhhmaaaa. Shhhh ...The heart of the Kabbalah, the very heart of Kabbalah is the line:“V’ahav’ta eit Adonai Elohekha b’khol l’vav’kha uv’khol naf’sh’kha uv’kholm’odekha”. Everyone who knows this line please say it with me.(Group:V’ahav’ta eit Adonai Elohekha b’khol l’vav’kha uv’khol naf’sh’khauv’khol m’odekha.) (Deuteronomy6:5.)When I was a child, we were taught that this meant, “You will lovethe Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with allyour might.” It was presented as a commandment, although, even asa child, I felt there was more to it. More resonance, another vibrationI could not quite link up with: more than a commandment, other thana commandment. It was a clue about who I was and what was in me.When I was a little older, I took it as an invitation: you are invitedto love God with all your heart and soul and might. A sort of invita-tion to God’s playground, God’s holy ground. You are invited to comeand play with God with all your heart and soul and might. Then,when I was still older, I started thinking, V’ahav’ta—and you will love.And you willlove, you will love. When I am in despair and wretchedCHAPTER TITLE11["},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"and totally unloving and hateful and miserable and have no guidanceor hope, something sometimes comes up in me and says, “I love you.”And it is the hope that I willlove. You willlove, you will love Godwith all your heart and soul and might.When I became older still, I began to sense this sentence as a state-ment of fact. It was just the way it was, it is the way we are imprinted.It is something in us, something in our foundation, a blueprint for ourvery being. It keeps changing, opening. One never stops growing intoit. We relate to it differently at different times, and it relates to usdifferently. It is a statement of fact. I love you. I love God with all myheart and soul and might. So let’s say that together: “I love God withall my heart and soul and might.” (Group: I love God with all myheart and soul and might. I love God with all my heart and soul andmight.) I love you. I love you. I love you with all my heart and souland might: a commandment, an invitation, a challenge, a fact. Theheart of both Kabbalah and Torah. Everything grows out of this love.The youin the words “and you will” is an inclusive you, meaningall of us. V’ahav’ta eit Adonai(“and you will love the Lord”). Adonai,as many of you know, is a substitute word. Adonaimeans “lord”, andit substitutes for the tetragrammaton, Yud-Hay-Vav-Hay. Throughoutthe Torah, Yud-Hay-Vav-Hay (YHVH)is the word that is used. Butthen, superimposed on it is Adonai.You are not supposed to say the tetragrammaton, YHVH. We do not even know how it is said, We do not know the vowel sounds,although early Christian texts tell us you say it, “Yahweh”. Some-times, in wry, humorous moments, I think maybe it was pronouncedOy-vey, or something that led to this all purpose expression. A fewdays ago, I stopped some very religious looking Jews in the park andasked them about words for God that were singular and plural. Intheir answer, they used the word Jaweh—avoiding pronunciation ofY and V. With Jaweh, you almost say the name without saying thename. Jaweh: close but not quite. Who knows?Here is a semi-Kabbalistic story. When I was a child in Passaic,New Jersey, a man from New York would come and visit us once ortwice a year seeking a charitable donation for the poor of his Chassidicgroup. His name was Rabbi Kellner and he always had a nice wordfor me, a little boy. When I saw him, something different happenedfrom the usual person I would meet in Passaic. His face had a glowand I did not know what the glow was. It did something special2KABBALAH AND PSYCHOANALYSIS"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"inside. When I grew up, I came to know the glow was a sense of theholy. When Rabbi Kellner came, my father stopped whatever he wasdoing. I do not remember much of what was said, but the feelingnever left. (Aner Govrin questioned me about my childhood inPassaic, New Jersey, and you can find out about it in ConversationsWith Michael Eigen, 2007.)When my father died in 1986 I went to a shul(synagogue, temple,house of prayer and study) near my house in Brooklyn to say kaddish.I picked this shulbecause, weeks before, the rabbi from this shulwaswalking down the street with a lulavand esrogand invited my five-year-old son and I to say a prayer and shake them. (The lulavis abundle of palm, myrtle and willow; the esroga citrus similar to alemon. You shake them all around you, God all around you, celebrat-ing Sukkot, holiday of huts and fall harvest, remembering the trekthrough the wilderness, underscoring impermanence and deepdependence on God.) My son and I enjoyed shaking them. It felt sogood that when I went to say kaddish, I picked this rabbi’s shul. Notlong before my father died, he told me the kaddish is not what manythink, a mourning prayer, a sad prayer—it is a song of praise, it singsGod’s praises. He meant me to say kaddish in this fashion.About the same time I started going to my neighbourhood shul, arabbi who spoke at my father’s funeral in Passaic put me in contactwith Rabbi Kastel in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. I spent some time withRabbi Kastel and when he heard my story about Rabbi Kellner, hefixed me up with Rabbi Kellner’s two sons, then old men living inCrown Heights. So there I was, a man in my fifties, studying withRabbi Kellner’s sons in Brooklyn. There is much to tell you about theseweekly visits, but that will have to wait for another day. I was luckyto have the time with them that I did, for, not long after we stopped,they left this earth. If that’s not Kabbalistic, I don’t know . . . The rabbiwhose shulI picked in my neighbourhood also had roots in CrownHeights—again, stories for another day.Time does strange things. It opens doors you do not expect to beopened. Doors close, doors open.Here is a little something the Kellners taught me. I asked them, inthe sh’ma, why are there two names of God, Yahweh and Elohenu(Sh’ma Yisroel, Adonai Elohenu, Adonai echad: Hear, O Israel, the Lord isour God, the Lord is one. Adonai, lord, is orally substituted for thewritten YHVH, the unsayable infinite mystery). They told me one isCHAPTER ONE3"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"singular and one is plural. YHVH—adonai, lord—singular. Elohenuplural, gods. In my mind—and they did not correct me—I took it thatall the gods, all the gods the Bible alludes to, or that anyone mightallude to, all are subsumed by the One, profiles of the One, so tospeak. The One and Only remaining beyond thought, image, word.All gods are One God, with the mystery of the One taking precedence.Plural and singular are one. A unity of plurality and the One.The oneruns through religions, doesn’t it? There is a one in Taoism.In Buddhism, there is one-finger Zen, our original face, and muchmore. At rock concerts, everyone waves their hand above their headwith their index finger pointing upward. At Matisyahu (a Chassidicrocker-rapper) concerts, the same thing happens, all the people in theroom waving one finger upward in time with the music. So this one isvery special, very popular. All one. When I think on it now, I get asense that I am honoured to be here. It is an honour to be with you.And it is an honour for us to be here at all. The Dalai Lama talks aboutthe precious human form, and my prayer is that we honour the dayand that the day honours us, that we are worthy of life this day andthat life gives us inspiration to go forward, to open a little more.It is one of the themes in Kabbalah, and one of the themes inaspects of psychoanalysis, that we are broken. And, at the same time,there is an odd paradox—a kind of paradoxical monism rather thandualism—that we are whole and broken at the same time. Psalms tellus that the soul is pure and kabbalah adds that there is a soul point incontact with God at all times. We might or might not be aware of thispoint of contact. A term like “point” is just an image for ineffablesense of contact with the Deepest of All. Yet, the psalms also tell us oftimes when we feel no contact, bereft of contact, abandoned, abysmal,and long for contact again. I said before that we are touching some-thing more than duality, but, paradoxically, we are deep in dualities.I am and am not in contact with God. We are and are not in contact.Something in me might be pure, I am not pure. I can be a devil. I ammischievous, weird, playful, nasty, selfish, and worse, yet I have tobear witness to something pure, whole, utterly uplifting and amazing:a miracle that a life form such as you and me should be. Crippled andwhole, corrupt and pure, and everything between and mixed. I wouldlike to touch the theme of brokenness more.Kabbalah is vast. Kabbalah is not a unified thing, an official set ofbooks like the Torah. It is an archipelago, fragments over time. That4KABBALAH AND PSYCHOANALYSIS"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"one wrote this, this one wrote that. It accumulates over many years,possibly to this day. Many tracts, books, visions, meditations, recordsof talks, probably spanning more than 2,000 years, reaching back toimaginative elaborations of what Torah is made of, hidden, deepermeanings. Kabbalah reaches us through broken forms touching aneedy core. It is about a deep intimacy we sense and express, lose, re-find, re-create in longing, suffering, and rejoicing.One thread on brokenness that has become a popular Kabbalahtheme is in Lurianic Kabbalah. Rabbi Isaac Luria taught in Safed in thesixteenth century. He did not write much, but a follower, Chaim Vital,wrote and reshaped his talks and teachings. I will share a little portionof his vision, which many of you know. We all have our idiosyncraticways of telling a story. God felt inspired to create something. It is oddto say this about God, since creativity, we imagine, is intrinsic to his“nature”. The God of Genesisis, if anything, a creative God. In thebeginning, God created or, to change it to something a little more likean ideogram: In the beginning God creating. Or leave out “in” and“the”: Beginning God Creating.Perhaps God felt a need to share creative being, although, again,the word “need” sounds suspect when it comes to certain views ofGod. In Kabbalah, God is often talked about as having needs,although one realises one is speaking about the unspeakable. To speakof need is to speak of love; to share creativity out of love, or simplyout of creativeness as such.Some Gnostic teachings tell us that creation is a kind of step down for God, a lower form of God’s being. There are Kabbalah teach-ings that echo this, but there are others that give a special weight tothis “lower” creation, a place of radical consequence, filled withspiritual possibility, a place where compassion can be realised, ascompassion and cruelty vie and intertwine. Life as home to anguishand joy.A problem God faced: how to go about creating something if youare everything? There is no room for creation if God fills everything.God’s problem is how to make room for anything but God. RabbiLuria (1534–1572) in Safed and Jacob Boehme, a German mystic borntwo years after Rabbi Luria died, had similar solutions. God contractsto make room for the world. I wonder if this is a kind of mysticalunderpinning for Martha Graham’s emphasis on contraction. I say this somewhat tongue in cheek because contraction has manyCHAPTER ONE5"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"possibilities, as in contracting with pain and anguish, or, more Taoist,part of the in-out rhythm of breath, or Melanie Klein’s unconsciousphantasy processes involving introjection–projection. We even speakof expanding–contracting universes. Then there is the wordplay, thedouble meaning of contract, to pull in, to make a contract with, acovenant.God pulls back, contracts. I see it as a bow: bowing, making roomfor the other. Making space, a covenant, a kind of mutual bowing.Now, everything we say about God, we are saying about ourselves.We say God is omniscient, omnipotent, but these are capacities wewish for ourselves. More, we act as if we are omniscient and omnipo-tent in important ways. That is, we act as if we know everything, ormore than we do, and that we have power to do whatever we want,or are deluded to think so. Omniscience and omnipotence as power-ful fantasies that permeate our behaviour, often with disastrousresults, sometimes with astonishing creative results. As analysts, wemight say we project omniscience–omnipotence on to God, reflectingour own preoccupation with knowledge and power. Look at all thetrouble we get into thinking we know more than we do and acting asif we are more powerful or should be, and the contraction we undergothinking that God is as we imagine. We impoverish God by contract-ing God to adumbrations of selected mental categories, mentalcontractions.Here is an example of omniscience. We knew—at least some of us knew, or thought they knew, or simply made believe theyknew—that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction andwe had better get him before he gets us. Omniscience has many vari-ations. We should know better. At times, we attribute omniscience toGod and blame him for the mess we are in. We shift the blame, thecause, the responsibility. But we do not know better, and blamingdoes not help. It is best to acknowledge this dangerous, at timesperverse quality we have, that we think we know more than we do.Luria and Boehme tell us God contracts to make room for us. Godmodels something for us. We need to contract, to make room. If weare only expanding, there is no room for others. It is good to be expan-sive and enjoy your expansive self. But if someone is telling you some-thing deeply meaningful, something real and true and delicate forthem, and you can only expand, how will you hear them, how willyou let them in?6KABBALAH AND PSYCHOANALYSIS"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"God contracted and made room for us. Not a hell of a lot of room,perhaps, but here we are, such as we manage to be. I would like toshare a vision, a paradoxical impossibility, which inner visionproposes as deep reality. God is wholly everywhere. Yet we are, weexist. Can we say we exist inside God, outside God, both, elsewhere?Is there any space that is not godspace? If God is everywhere, how canwe feel without Him? Yet we do. We have no access to God who isalways accessible; accessible yet withdraws and, in coming and going,quickens us with pain and joy: partly a cruel vision, partly embracing.A primordial “now you see him, now you don’t”, connecting with thecoming and going of our own aliveness and self-feeling, ouremotional fluctuations. At the same time, Chassidus (Schneerson,1998) tells us, there is a soul point ever in contact with God that, inour experience, waxes and wanes, or perhaps is like a constant humin the background.In Rabbi Luria’s story, even though God tried to make room for us,something went wrong. Vessels that were meant to hold and transmitand transmute godly energy shattered. Vessels emanating creationbroke at lower levels of formation. They could not take the intensityof the energy they were mediating. Some of the higher channelsremained intact, but those most involved in what turned out to be ourworld (and us) shattered. I was touched in a recent Anselm Kieferexhibit by a sculptural representation of the Shekinah in tatters, torn,smudged, burn marks on her rag-like, princess-like garment, perhapsa wedding gown (the Sabbath bride). Shekinah, whatever else, isGod’s Presence in us, on earth, in the tenth Sephirot, Malkut, one of theshattered spheres, dimensions, vessels, channels. (Appendix 1: Ein Sofand the SephirotTree of Life.) It is said our challenge, our job, is torepair the rupture. Wherever we are, embedded in the shatter, in theshards, the brokenness, there are divine sparks awaiting redemptionwith our help. And we are helped by the Divine Presence, theShekinah, which, in Kiefer’s vision, partakes in the dust and ashes ofour scarred beings. One cannot help turning letters around, wonder-ing about scarred—scared—sacred.That creation and the creative process could not bear its own inten-sity teaches us, as psychotherapists, to go slow, dose it out. WilfredBion (1970; Eigen, 1998) sees catastrophic processes at the beginningof psychic life and writes of a sense of catastrophe as a link thatcements personality together. He cites Rabbi Luria as resonant withCHAPTER ONE7"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"his concerns and adds a new turn. Bion feels we cannot take the inten-sity of our own experience. We are, in some sense, embryonic withregard to ability to work with our experiential capacity. We are ableto process or digest very little of what has impacts on us. Bionpresents this as a kind of developmental and evolutionary challenge:how to grow psychic capacity to work with the psyche. Or, to put itslightly differently, how to grow ability to work with emotional prob-lems, the disturbances human personality presents. I hope time willallow us to develop this theme further.Bion is parallel to Luria: our system cannot take very much ofitself. Experiencing cannot take too much experiencing. We do notknow what to do with ourselves and our experiential capacity. Thelatter produces experiences that are too much for us, that we cannot“handle”. If one meets this situation, begins taking it in, a broader atti-tude develops. If the patient seems not to be changing and you aregetting impatient and irritated, contract, make room for apparentunchanging. Armed with Luria–Bion, you are aware that our systemcannot take too much. Changes of energy, shifts of being and ways of being might be too much for this patient now. The patient’s“unchanging” might be too much for you now. Contract, make room,for the patient and yourself, your frustration and the patient’s slowpace. There are always other ways to view a situation. Much thathappens imperceptibly may surface in surprising ways when oneleast expects it.Remember Luria’s story: God contracted all at once to create our world and life, and the vessels transmitting being could not takethe process. This is akin to saying the psyche cannot take the forces ofpsychotherapeutic change. In psychotherapy, slow is important,dosing is important. It is not just repetition. It is giving time for some-one to get ready, build capacity for a little more. Therapeutic changeis difficult and it takes time to build ability to make use of it, let ithappen, digest it. We have to build resources that make therapeuticchange possible. Building up resources is crucial.Some of you heard me tell this story before (at the end of PsychicDeadness, 1996). Susan Deri used to talk about it at meetings. It was acase of a “chronic schizophrenic” man. Over the course of fifteen ortwenty years of work together, he improved. He now had an apart-ment; he now took care of himself. He had a more independent exis-tence. He was alone, but he was surviving, living the life he could.8KABBALAH AND PSYCHOANALYSIS"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Then this man gets the idea—it came to him—that he wants to fall inlove. And, lo and behold, it happens. Susan was wary about it. Howcould this happen, how could he manage it? Is he equipped for it? Shefollowed him, went with him, supported him. He falls in love. And,lo and behold, someone falls in love with him. And they get married.And he’s overjoyed. And he drowns on his honeymoon. He had aheart attack and died on his honeymoon. Now this love that he had,this moment of falling in love, was something that Susan did not have.She had grown children but this kind of love was not part of her life.Her patient had it but he did not have the resources to take it.What can you say? Would it have been better for him to remain“chronic schizophrenic” (his diagnosis in those days), making do withthe existence he could take, or break through his walls and shatter?Well, in day-to-day life, you usually do not have to make decisionslike this. The work is slow enough and gradually you build a floor,you build resources to support feelings. Feelings need support andyou build psychic resources to support the life of feelings a little at atime. Therapy supports the slow growth of affective life.In Susan Deri’s patient’s case, something shattered. Vessels of lifecould not take the life process. Life shattered under the impact of life.How does life make room for life? In Kabbalah, God pulled back,made room, and life could not take it, it was too much, and life broke.That is a predicament we find ourselves in. We are told that our job isto repair the world, repair the vessels, put God’s name together, putHumpty Dumpty back together. What does it mean to repair God’sname? Help a broken God? Help a broken God within ourselves? Wehave severed God. We are severed beings. Severed beings with asevered God. There is no end to brokenness, no end to repair. But isit simply repair, or is brokenness part of creativity? We are creatinglife together, life is creating us—and what we call brokenness is partof it, part of creating.What do we say is broken? Shirah Kober Zeller speaks of God’sbroken heart. Frances Tustin speaks of an infant’s broken heart. Theterm “broken heart” is part of the wisdom of language. When Freudtells us that words or events can be a “blow to the face” or “stab in theheart”, he does not mean it only metaphorically. Tustin and Zellerspeak of a broken heart at the core of existence. Perhaps there are twohearts: broken and whole. Or one emotional heart capable of beingboth broken and whole. One being, many states and conditions.CHAPTER ONE9"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"How do we respond to our broken hearts, to God’s broken heart?Fight? Get rid of it? Blame? Hide? Run? Grieve?

How do we go about growing with abroken heart without doing too much damage to ourselves and eachother? How do we survive ourselves and with what quality?The Baal Shem Tov, an eighteenth century mystic credited as thefounder of Hasidism, would say divine sparks are buried in broken-ness and our job is to free them, unite them with Divinity. The BaalShem Tov translates as something like “Master of the Good Name”,or perhaps “A Good Master of the Divine Name”. His name was Israelben Eliezer (son of Eliezer). There are many tales of the Baal ShemTov, an inspiriting presence.Many Kabbalistic writings recycle the Greek distinction betweenhyle (matter) and animating spirit (nous), or rational intelligence.Matter is lower and “dumb”. Spirit/intelligence animates it, gives itform. For Aristotle, rational intellect was the defining capacity forrealised humanity. Lower–higher play a basic role in thinking aboutlife and human capacities. Lower–higher categories and imagerypermeate Kabbalistic vision and thought. This is partly modelled onthe upright posture of the human body. Head above, feet below dove-tails with sky above, earth below. When the Chassid prays, he ties abelt around his waist to signify an upper–lower division. He ascendsin prayer, not descends to lower appetites. You would not besurprised to learn that a common problem in prayer is keeping outdisturbing, lower thoughts and urges.There is much to say about the upper–lower structure in humanexperience and perhaps we can come back to this (I amplify aspects ofupper–lower structures of experience in The Psychotic Core,1986).Now, I wish only to point out that the shattering of the vessels andscattering of divine sparks result in sparks being “buried” in matter.The higher is buried in the lower, the pure in the corrupt or base.There is, also, Biblical ground for this distinction. From dust we comeand to dust and ash we go. God’s inspiriting breath animates the clay(Adam) that man is made of. The Holy Spirit gives us Life.The scattered spiritual sparks trapped in matter need to bereleased. Matter seems to be something of a villain in this context. Theheaviness of matter holds spirit down. Spiritual sparks need to be10KABBALAH AND PSYCHOANALYSIS"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"freed and united with their Source. The freeing of spirit from matteris a Kabbalah sub-theme, an important one. One often gets the sensethat a basic battle is between spirit and matter, higher and lower, as ifspirit is good and matter “bad”. This can obscure a struggle in spirititself, between different affective attitudes: for example, betweencruelty and compassion. Struggle between caring and cruelty is also athread in Kabbalah, in which one finds many threads in manycontexts. A third complementary or compensating thread is a sensethat our job is precisely to help the “material” world inthe materialworld, with our mitzvot (good deeds), our care and blessings, work inthe trenches, discovery and creative partnership in the holiness ofeveryday.As a psychoanalytic psychologist, I reshape the spark story, shiftits point of emphasis. I am not sure what to do with the matter–psyche distinction, it is so complex an issue, filled with possibilities(something I take up in The Psychotic Core). My variation of the story:the psyche is broken and has all sorts of buried sparks, sparks of life.When sparks of life come up, you think, “O my God, I’m alive!” Andthen it fades and you think, “Here I am again, plain me.” States shiftand sometimes we feel freer, a spark of life freeing a fuller, more alive,richer self. Aliveness can be many things, quiet aliveness, stillness,from the aliveness of sleeping to banging cymbals and dancing withjoy (for the deep aliveness of stillness, see “The Yosemite God” inFeeling Matters(Eigen, 2006)). To learn how to be alive is a work inprogress, touching capacities with unknown possibilities and nuancesof experiencing.I have heard Rebbe Menachem Schneerson say, “Wherever youfind yourself, no matter how desolate or meaningless a place, there iswork to be done, sparks to be freed.” I might add, sparks to be mined.Wherever you are, there are sparks to be mined. Sparks of life to bereleased in whatever place you find yourself, sparks to be experi-enced, worked with, created—transformative moments. Sparks tocontact, connect with, undo dissociations, splits. There is a hiddenspark everywhere. Wherever you are means “psychically”, the“place” you are living your life, the feel of your life. Whatever yourpsychic space might be—despair, rage, love, hate, deadness, fear,joy—wherever you are, a spark is waiting for you, for you alone,because only you can contact, distil, release, explore, and be a vehiclefor your unique set of sparks. Sparks right now in a process ofCHAPTER ONE11"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"creation. No one can do it but you, because the sparks you areinvolved with are creating your own being, coming into existencewith your own life. There is a saying in Judaism that the whole world,the whole creation was made just for you. Of course, that is balancedby other sayings, and by life itself. When I read the word “metta” thatSara (Sara Weber, one of the founders of the NYU ContemplativeStudies Project) signs at the end of email communications—a Paliword meaning loving kindness ... I forgot what I was going to say ... maybe it will come back later ... [It did, see p. 37.]Audience member: It felt like you knew her spark when she writesthat. That somehow it connects to something.Response: That’s not what I was thinking but I like it.Audience member: Each of us are individual sparks, each of us aloneto all of us ...Response: That’s not what I had in mind but I like that, too.We are the tender of the sparks. Not just the tender of the garden,but tender of the sparks in our garden. Sparks grow in our garden andgardens grow in our sparks.Brokenness. Before going further with psychoanalysis and broken-ness, I’d like to say another word on an aspect of Kabbalah. It growsfrom the V’ahav’ta(love God with all your heart and soul and might).In a very lonely time in my life, I would be in my bed late at night andout of the blue the words, “I love you,” would come up. It was notaddressed to anyone in particular. Was it addressed to me? From me? Something in me was saying, “I love you.” One could interpretthat I was saying it to me, but it did not feel that way. “I love you”welling up from loneliness, coming from beyond. “I love you” as akind of support, a wish, a longing, but something, too, at the heart ofdevotion, something that just is.I am thinking of one of my favorite Kabbalists, Rabbi Akiva. Ivisited his grave in Israel in Tiberias: a simple grave. You would notknow that anyone great was buried in it. It was not like the greattombs in London; it was not like the pyramids. A simple stone, youcan hardly see anything that it says. All alone in the desert sand. Whata thrill, such a deep thrill. One story is that men were praying in a shul(house of prayer and learning) and a little boy was in the back. Themen became aware of a glow coming from the back of the prayerhouse and when they investigated found a boy sitting and reciting the12KABBALAH AND PSYCHOANALYSIS"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"alphabet, aleph, bet, gimmel . . . He did not know Hebrew, he did notknow the prayers. An illiterate boy who could not even say the wholealphabet, but what he knew he repeated over and over with all hisheart and soul, a glow rising above him. He spoke the letters withkavana. Kavana can mean “concentration”, “one-pointed concentra-tion”, or “intention”. Some connect it with devotion, here, I feel,whole-hearted devotion. Allmy heart and soul—who can do that?!It is good to have stories and myths. They express deep emotionsof the human race or individuals, make you feel something that is real.Some touch something you feel is “all” in you, a special “all-sense”that brings wonder and tears and joy. We are only always part, andyet feel this “all”.Rabbi Akiva learned to read and write in his forties. He became,we are told, one of the great Merkabah mystics, the chariot-thronemystics. Ezekiel envisioned angels moving on four wheels, with fourwings and four faces (man, lion, ox, eagle), constituting or “driving”a chariot that linked with, perhaps in some way was, God’s throne.Meditating on this vision, angels, wheels, wings, chariot, faces, thronewas a pure “ride” to God, the holy chariot a direct link with God’sthrone. Rabbi Akiva may have been an accomplished throne-chariotmystic, but much more. He died at the hands of the Romans. Therewere strong prohibitions imposed after the destruction of the secondtemple, restrictions of Jewish observance and prayer. Rabbi Akiva waskilled for violating these restrictions. He was a great teacher and hada following. We are told he was crucified, perhaps burnt, but thecentre of the story is, as part of the procedure, the Roman soldiers tookoff his skin. I picture him crucified, in flames. And while his skin wasbeing peeled and death imminent, he is said to have thanked God forgiving him a chance to know and live “m’odekha” (“might”). “All mylife I loved God with all my heart and soul. I always wanted a chanceto love Him with all my might. Now I can love You with all my heartand soul and might.” “M’odekha” has various translations or mean-ings, mightone of them. Possessions another—all that you possess,materially and spiritually, all that is in you, your all. Still another, tolove God with both your good and evil inclinations, your all. InEnglish, “might” resonates with power, strength, time, possibility, allthat is possible, all one’s being and potential.This story touches the pinnacle of Rabbi Akiva’s life, “I love youwith all my heart and soul and might, everything, all I am, my all.”CHAPTER ONE13"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"My very body, my very skin, my very being is now Yours in this love.The summit of the little boy reciting aleph, bet with total devotion.

This is heavy stuff.But in some spiritual, psychological, emotional sense, most of us—Ican only speak for myself—but if you are here today as spiritual seek-ers, then I bet it is likely that many among you were skinned ininfancy.I would like to do one more thing before we take a break. Whenwe come back from the break we will get more into psychoanalysis.Now I would like to lead a little guided meditation. This is based ona Bal Shem Tov story. He would go to a place in the forest where heprayed. The generations after him knew the place but not the prayers.Still later generations did not even know the place. They knew therewas a place and prayers, but no longer knew where or what theywere. Eventually, people did not even know the forest.I will speak and see if you can find what you can find.Guided meditationPicture going into the forest. You don’t know where the place is.

But before gettinginto that, I cannot resist plucking out some phrases from the psalms.I do not know if everyone knows or reads the psalms. One of my waysof reading the Bible is to tune into the vein, the thread, the emotionalworld dramatised by the characters at a particular moment. If youbracket the belief system for a time, if you can do that, you are goingto find sets of powerful emotions. If you do not try to name them tooquickly, emotional worlds open up. The psalms are one of the quick-est ways to get to some of these strong feelings.Here are some random phrases: “My wound exudes into the nightwithout ceasing.” “My soul refuses to be comforted.” “My spiritfaints.” “You hold fast the lids of my eyes.” “I throb with pain andcould not speak.” “With my heart I meditate, and my spirit searchesdiligently.” Some phrases that occur to me now have to do withdepths. “Depths” is a big biblical term. Depths associated with Godand associated with us: “Out of my depths I cry to you.” “You searchmy hidden depths.”It does not take much to live your way into the feelings thesehuman beings, who lived long ago, expressed. People writing aboutdepths of feeling. Human depths, Godly depths.Will my Lord, my God, cast me out forever? Will He no longer befavourable? Has His kindness ceased forever? Has His anger shut offHis mercies? Does He act this way to terrify me, to bring me to Him?“Out of the depths, out of the abyss, I cry to You.”Here are a few more phrases: “Seek His presence continually.”“You have put me into the lowest pit.” How can you keep seeking Hispresence continually if He put you into the lowest pit? I think of Job:“Yay, though You slay me, yet will I trustYou.” Where does that comefrom? Freud’s masochism, the death drive? Yay, though You slay me,yet will I trustYou. It silences psychoanalysis. “Render justice to thelonely and the orphaned.” “A burnt offering You do not desire. Theoffering You love is a broken spirit, a broken and humble heart.”“Make me have gladness in rejoicing so that the bones You havecrushed will rejoice.” “In Your light do we see light.” “Reflect in yourhearts upon your bed and be still.” “You put joy in my heart.” “AllCHAPTER ONE15"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"who take refuge in You will sing forever.” “Sing a new song unto theLord (YHVH).” “I will sing to my God as long as I live.”There is a phrase, “holy mountain”, a phrase you will come acrossin the sutras and psalms, where mountains dance with joy and skip.Skipping and dancing mountains are something that both ZenBuddhism and the psalms speak of. Such exultation that even moun-tains dance and skip and sing.One might say there is a kind of bipolar range of emotions thepsalms give us. The depths of despair without You, bereft of the HolyPresence. The beloved is gone, the Other gone. Winnicott describes asituation I call “the Z dimension”. Winnicott writes of a mother whogoes away from the baby for X time, then comes back and the baby isall right. Mother goes away for X + Y time, comes back, baby is allright enough, takes a hit perhaps, but weathers it. Mother’s gone forX + Y + Z time, comes back, baby is changed permanently. A perma-nent alteration of the kind Freud speaks of in “Analysis terminableand interminable” (1937c). One might say, something of the infant isgone, has entered the Z dimension. Something happened that, if notirreparable, offers dire obstacles. In the psalms, this is given expres-sion in the most personal way, a soul journey. Here—gone. Where areYou? Where is the Presence that is always here? Where did You go?Will I ever get out of hell? Worse than hell? When presence comesback, life comes back. Joy and singing come back. “I go to bed weep-ing and wake up laughing.”In the psalms, it appears, the Z dimension can be reversible. Thesoul goes under, suffers torment, death, and returns, alive, thankful,one with Life again. A deep model for therapy and daily living, aswell. I think of Freud saying that the presence of dreams gives us hopethat psychotic states can be helped, since we undergo temporarypsychotic moments in dreams and then awake to everyday life again.I am tempted to say, also, that the presence of psalms gives us hopethat the most mangled states can be helped, for similar reasons.Dreaming consciousness, void awareness, everyday waking life—allcombined and variably mixed—feed the emotionally colourful worldthat makes us feel alive.One thing that Judaism contributes is an amazing range ofemotionality. Your emotions, your most personal emotions, the wholerainbow, hell to heaven, your broken, crying, longing, joyous heart—I do not know any literature as personal and emotional as the biblical16KABBALAH AND PSYCHOANALYSIS"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"literature. Bion has extracted from this literature many things. One ishis attraction to myths or “stories” where something bad happens.They might begin happily enough. For example, the Tower of Babelstory: people work together to build a tower to heaven. What couldbe better? Who does not want to reach heaven? Sounds like a goodthing to do, build a tower to contact God. A link from Earth to heaven,from the soul to God. Building as a co-operative activity, people work-ing well together. For some reason, God does not take a fancy to it anddestroys the tower. What seems to be a good intention, linking withGod and each other, turns into a disaster. People in disarray, loss ofcommon language, connections lost, unities lost. Diffusion spreads,fragmentation spreads. What can we draw from it?Beware of unities? Unities are dangerous? Unities fission. Unionsexplode. Are we marked by explosive unions? Swings betweenmaking and breaking links? A reminder that there is always differenceas well as union? Where there is union, difference asserts itself (andvice versa?).Bion asks, what did people do to deserve this punishment? Theywere linking up and working together and a destructive force stopsthem. Bion calls attention to a destructive force in human life. Godplays the role of punisher in the story. But the destructive tendency ispart of our beings, whether directed outside or inside. God expresses ahuman tendency. A configuration we know well, but find it hard totake in and work with. We make a creative, co-operative effort andsomething jams it, threatens to undo or deform it. In vernacular, weoften say we “screwed up”, “messed up”. We make a linking effortand it gets damaged or destroyed. I think of the imp peering out of aman’s chest on the book cover of George Groddeck’s Book of the It.During the Second World War, unexplained mess-ups were attributedto an imp, Kilroy, “Kilroy was here.”(Digression: whimsical word play—the name, Kilroy links withKill-roi, kill the king. That is, we are not masters (kings) of our ownhouse, but subject to slippage, uncertainty, fallible reversals of allsorts, including impish destruction.)Perhaps one aspect of destructive urges is a need to be free of links.I want to link up, but not be too linked up. I want to breathe freely,neither too linked nor unlinked. Links begin to sound like chains, andno chains like nothing. Between claustrophobia and agoraphobia,philobat–ocnophil (Balint, 1959). What do we do with this paradoxical,CHAPTER ONE17"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"double capacity? I call it a distinction–union structure, a double orparadoxical structure, in which distinction and union tendenciescontribute (Eigen, 1986, 1992, 1993, 1995, 2011). Each of these threadsor tendencies, distinction and union, has a biography.Some people are more one or the other. A union person might beafraid of distinction. A distinction person might be afraid of union.Whichever side is dominant, the other side will manifest itself. Manymovies portray dramas between distinction–union tendencies.Different characters portray different tendencies. You might have avery separate type of person and a very union type of person. By thetime the movie ends, each has made a little move towards the middleor the relationship explodes or collapses. Both tendencies can beexplosive or dictatorial, validating one capacity over the other, veer-ing between collision and elusive dissociations.The Babel story has both of these tendencies. At the outset, we areunited, co-operative. We build, then destroy. A destructive forcecomes. Probably from within and between ourselves, the friction ofdifferences or suffocation of claustrophobia breaks the unity.Cosmic thinking tells us there are destructive forces in theuniverse. And, since we are part of the universe, destruction worksthrough us. There are creative forces in the universe, destruction partof the mix. We do not know what to make of relationships betweencreativeness–destructiveness. Bion calls attention to a conjunction oftendencies: we build, unite, work together, and destroy what we arebuilding at the same time. I used to see Con Edison (a utility companythat supplies electricity) signs when workers were destroying thestreets: “Dig we must for growing New York.”One of my favourite quotes about the universe, by the physicist,Eddington: “Something unknown is doing we don’t know what.”Something unknown. Do I hear Ein Sof? The unknown infinite ofinfinites, for which there is no name or knowledge, our unknowingthe only means of approach? How does unknowing and somethingunknown fly in the face of omniscient, omnipotent us? Unknowingmeets our know-it-all attitude. Know-nothing, know-everything, andsomething in between.I used to worry during the Cold War that the United States orRussia would press the atomic war “button” from the viewpoint ofomniscience. One or the other side would falsely think it knew some-thing about the other that, in fact, it did not know. For example,18KABBALAH AND PSYCHOANALYSIS"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"“knowing” Russia was about to press the button so we must press thebutton first. Well, thank God that did not happen.

And it continues. Psychopathicuse of omniscience to get what one wants. Psychopathic use of omni-science and phony omnipotence. We, protector of democracy, also abully, the strongest, Number One, the most powerful nation in worldhistory, etc. So much that we attribute to God in some way applies toour own states and attitudes. Omniscience and omnipotence, forexample. Apply these to yourselves. How does omniscience–omnipo-tence work in your own life? How has it helped you get as far as youhave? How does megalomania play a role in creativity? How does ithelp? How does it mess things up? We all have to pretend to knowmore and be stronger (and maybe weaker too) than we are to getthrough childhood, even to get through our daily tasks.Bion draws out mixtures of tendencies in biblical stories like Edenand Babel. Curiosity, good fruit, desire, wanting to be like God, some-thing bad happens. Desire–punishment, or, in William Blake’s terms,innocence–experience. Good turning bad is a basic structure LurianicKabbalah and Bionic psychoanalysis share. Both gravitate to cata-strophic realities. Bion shadows Lurianic Kabbalah by depictingtrauma and psychic origins with a Big Bang image, a constitutivepsychic shattering. He relates the Big Bang image to an explosivebeginning of psychic life and also the birth of psychosis (Bion, 1970,Chapter Two; Eigen, 1998, Chapter Three). In psychosis, he depicts anexplosion (trauma), with bits and pieces of personality floating inspace at accelerating velocity, going further and further away fromeach other and further from the point of explosion (O, origin). Linksthin, possibly are lost as diffusion grows. Catrastrophe links person-ality together. Some of these bits and pieces might pop up and hit youin the therapy room, and you might try to talk about them and makesense of them. But you might be running before you have a ball. Thebits and pieces of exploded personality floating in the room might not be redolent with meaning so much as flotsam and jetsam of anextended SOS signal, like a thinning, vanishing scream over time(Eigen, 2002, pp. 151–155). You might be speaking to the wind as thepiece you address continues to rush away. It just happened to passthrough your office at that moment. Even so, the vanishing debrisCHAPTER ONE19"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"might have value as passing signals of a catastrophic process thatbegan long ago and still goes on.A therapeutic value of this depiction is support in keeping youreye on the originating explosive process. Feel the impact, an implicitsense that might be translated something like:I am a catastrophe in process. My personality is catastrophic.Something awful has happened, is happening. I am undergoinga state of disintegration, flying off into space. I am happening tome; I am a constant disturbance to myself.A black box, a black hole is flashing an extended SOS signal. It issignalling that there is no end to destruction. If you are getting frus-trated because the patient is not getting better, maybe you are tryingtoo hard or working with something that is unavailable. Maybe partof what needs to happen is to sit with the explosion, hear the SOS.A Kabbalistic exercise, suggested by Rabbi Nachman is: listen,hear the scream. There is a scream inside. It is faint, dying out,perhaps already has died out. But when you listen, it gets louder andlouder. Stay with that scream, an inaudible scream of your patient’sbeing, perhaps your own being as well.What do you do with a screaming adult, a screaming baby? Thescream is a sign of distress that cannot be addressed by the screamingone. A distress the adult or baby cannot solve, an unsolvable distur-bance. And that is where you come in. Not that you have a quick fix, asolution. But you are prepared to stay with that scream for decades, tosit with the unsolvable disturbance, providing a background. A back-ground support for something to grow over time.So catastrophe, explosiveness—a big theme in Bion and Kabbalah.The shattering of the vessels, the shattering of personality. What canthe psychoanalyst bring in face of this catastrophic happening andongoing disturbance?Bion called psychoanalysis—for example, the psychoanalysis thathe underwent with Melanie Klein—a catastrophe. He speaks ofpsychoanalysis as a catastrophe one has to survive.What is the state, the attitude, he counters to catastrophe? ForBion, the attitude, state, and disposition with which we meet cata-strophe is Faith. Not “K”, not knowledge. He is not anti-knowledge.Knowing plays an important role in his work. But it is faith he posits20KABBALAH AND PSYCHOANALYSIS"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"as the only state of being that meets catastrophe (Eigen, 1993,Chapters Eleven and Seventeen). He creates a special notation toexpress this: F in O, where O signifies unknown ultimate reality, espe-cially, in psychoanalysis, emotional reality. He calls Faith the psycho-analytic attitude, which includes the discipline of being withoutmemory, expectation, understanding, or desire. Paradox: psycho-analysis as catastrophic, the psychoanalytic attitude (F) the way tomeet it.Something in Bion’s work touches a chord in Saint Augustine’sConfessions. You go through everything with Augustine. He becomesobsessive. Should I go to a play? Have sex with my girlfriend? I amnot fully devoted to God if I go to plays and have sex. He loved plays,loved his girlfriend, but felt Eros and theatre conflicted with his lovefor God. In each chapter he goes through gruelling conflict. He exer-cises thought, but will fails. Reason is not enough, but he takes it asfar as he can. There is spiritual suspense, human suspense. You do notknow what is going to happen at the beginning of a chapter. Youmight “know” cognitively, but Augustine takes you through itemotionally. You are in emotional suspense and crises. All his know-ledge seems helpless in the face of obsessive difficulties. Helpful to apoint, then a limit. The chapters end with reason trailing into Faith,into love: O my God, I love You. You are wherever I am. You are inmy anxiety, my inability to help myself, in my abyss; You are in myunsolvable problems, my unsolvability. Wherever I find myself, Youare there. Every chapter ends like that. Augustine finds God every-where. Wherever he is, God is. A little reminiscent of the culminationof Job’s mystical moment—just God! Faith itself.For Bion, the psychoanalytic attitude is Faith. Most workers asso-ciate psychoanalysis with knowledge, understanding, insight (K).Many Bion readers emphasise K. But, as Bion’s work unfolds, Fassumes central importance. In my writings on the area of faith inBion (1993, 1998), I try to work out relations between faith and know-ledge, an ongoing effort. A certain primacy of faith emerges that situ-ates knowing. Grotstein (2007) is one of the few who sees this aspectof Bion’s work and amplifies it (e.g., his writings on the backgroundsubject or Presence of primary identification). Bion emphasizses whatis not known in a session. A session is about what we do not know.We work with unknown impacts. Faith is an opening to the unknown.What on earth can faith do in face of catastrophic realities, bigCHAPTER ONE21"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"bangs, small bangs, explosiveness, shatter, shards, sparks? For Bion,in faith we do not know, but its call to openness does something to us.I go back to a moment in Job’s story: “Yea though You slay me yet willI trust You”. A moment of Bionic faith. A process of transformationJob unwittingly lived, peeling layers of perception, mystical skin.Bion denotes unknown reality as “O” and writes of Faith in O. O can be catastrophic. It gives rise to many kinds of impacts. The Songof Songsregisters O-impacts in another key, in terms of erotic longingand bliss rather than imminent catastrophe. In a sense, O isEddington’s unknown doing we don’t know what. We can make acase that O resonates with Ein Sofin its unknowability. In a deep andpregnant sense, Bion is a guardian of the unknown.In Cogitations(1994b, pp. 323, 325; Appendix 4: O-grams), he offerstwo O-grams (my term), a kind of tree of life, starting with O alone atthe bottom, giving rise to cosmic–human creative ventures, offspring.In a way, Bion’s depiction complements the Kabbalah tree of life (thesephirot), which starts at the top and flows downward, Ein Sofbeyondthe top, above the sephirotchannelling downward flowing divine life. (Appendix 1: Ein Sofand the SephirotTree of Life.) Bion’s secondO-gram (1994b, p. 325; Appendix 4, O-gram No. 2) has arrows point-ing downward from all the creative offspring towards O, whichstands alone at the bottom. Taking the two O-grams together, we canenvision creative flow bottom up, top down, or in all directions. Whatwe learn or discover or create at “higher” levels feeds back to O, inter-acts with O, generating further creativeness.While energy emanates top-down in the sephirotand bottom up inBion’s O-gram, there is multi-directional flow of possibilities. MarionMilner is fond of pointing out that energy flows both ways,top–bottom, bottom–top. This, too, is inherent in Bion’s and Kab-balah’s depictions, above ↔below. But a difference in representationsexists which must be pointed out: O at the bottom, Ein Sofat the top.The O-grams suggest a profound monism; O-transformations atwork in the creative fanning of life through experience and its expres-sions. Bion writes that he is interested in the poetry of life, the poeticspirit, yet the roots of poetry are in language. And language? He asks,“What is important? The root? The flower? The germ? The conflict?The durability?” (1994b, p. 323; Appendix 4) He adds that any otherexperiential domain can be substituted for categories he chose. Sightcan be “replaced by taste, touch, smell, sound, etc., from infra-sensual22KABBALAH AND PSYCHOANALYSIS"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"to ultra-sensual” (p. 325). Bion leaves open how one might depict theparticular experiential domain constituted by psychoanalysis. Perhapsit would have roots and branches or, as some might say, grow morelike a rhizome. Bion’s grid (1994b, p. 295; Appendix 5) might be oneattempt at representing aspects of a psychoanalytic domain, butexpressive attempts are very much in process. Whatever representa-tions you favour, for Bion, psychoanalytic experience invites explo-ration in its own right.Whether Ein Sofat the top or O at the bottom, Bion protects the unknown, and Faith for him is an attitude of approach to theunknown: a radical faith in the face of decimation. He even speaksabout suffering joy, building capacity to suffer joy. It could beassumed that joy is easy to take. But, from the perspective Bion devel-ops, our capacity to bear and process any affective state is lacking.Care, development, and time is needed to begin the kind of growth ofcapacity needed to digest emotional life and see where it can go.When he writes that every dream is an aborted dream, he means thatevery affect is an aborted affect—partially aborted. He writes as if theaffective world is difficult to take, that we cannot tolerate and do notknow what to do with our feelings. Often we break off what we areexperiencing, divert, escape, re-channel, act out, somatise, and engagein creative struggle. Our psychophysical system produces states itcannot process, its productions ahead of ability to digest and usethem. In extreme instances, our own impact on ourselves can kill usor make us sick. We sometimes fall ill, even die, from intensity orstrangeness of feelings, at times at a loss for a frame of reference forexperience. In one of his images, Bion suggests as analogue, bleedingto death in our own tissues. At any moment, our K functions mightnot be up to the task of understanding what is happening to us, inclu-ding our own effect on ourselves. And yet, how precious are momentsof realisation, seeing an experience through as best we can, the unex-pected unfolding of life as we grapple with it, as we wait on it.I recently received a report on Internet mailing lists detailing theprogress research on schizophrenia has made, emphasising neuralimaging and chemical treatments. Yet, the report ended by saying thatwe cannot rely on the very biological interventions it praised, forexample, that there is nothing we can find in neuro-imaging that tellsus what do with a psychotic individual in real life. There are too manycomplexities, gaps, and possibilities at work. We get back to someCHAPTER ONE23"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"unknown place. We experiment with medications and sometimes theyare very helpful. I am not anti-medication. Yet, it is good to keep inmind that there are unknown aspects to what we are medicating.This is even true with an electric light. I can turn a light on or off,but I do not know how it works. An electrician knows. But, if youpush him, “Tell more about electricity”, at some point he will get tothe end of his knowledge, perhaps pretty quickly. What the hell iselectricity? We do a lot with a lot of things with very partial know-ledge of how they work or what they are capable of doing. Scientiststell us most matter of the universe is unknown, we do not know whatit is. If this is true of the physical universe, whatever we mean byphysical, how much more so with the psychical and spiritual. Weknow how to push and pull some switches, but what we are pushingand pulling remains a mystery.We can have a good meditation session and open a channel. Butwhat are we monkeying with? We might depict faith as an intuitiveorgan, an attitude through which we try to meet what we monkeywith: faith as an open channel in face of everything. Or whatever wecan take of everything. How much life can we take, our leaky, explo-sive, alone and together life?Alone—all one. All one—alone. Back and forth, a kind of psychicheartbeat. Now this, now that. Building the tower of Babel, destroyingit. God—no God. Self—no self. Back and forth, both together, terms ofconstant conjunctions, dual tendencies, capacities, states, moments.Perhaps we are trying to develop another way of thinking, a moreinclusive attitude. Not just this vs. that. We are not too far along thispath. We fight over beliefs instead of taking beliefs as signals, bleepsof larger rhythms of which we have intimations. Buddha did not takea stand about many belief systems—is the soul eternal? What is theultimate nature of the universe? When strong beliefs came into view,beliefs people fight over, Buddha might say, “I don’t know. I can’tdecide. It is not relevant to you growing as a person, working on your-self. Practise. Keep practising.” So many unanswerable questions. Somuch to do, unending work with oneself, trying to open, help insteadof harm. Buddha was a little like Freud saying that free associationwill free you from karma. (Donald Levy, Emeritus Professor ofPhilosophy, Brooklyn College, suggested this to me.)We are made of rigid, persistent systems that go through almostanything. Yet, we are also fragile.

A psychological breakdown, a somatic breakdown. Psychicsymptoms, somatic symptoms. So many tensions, the tension of beingalive. We are unsolved problems. Our feeling of aliveness itself can bea problem with no solution. How to dose emotional life, channel alive-ness. How to work and live with aliveness is an unknown we areworking on, experimenting, trying.We have touched several themes in Bion: catastrophe, faith,dosage, unknown reality, O. How much of ourselves can we take andwith what quality? There are other themes we may not have time for. One is transformations. Both Kabbalah and Bion are interested in what Bion calls transformations. Transformation is part of spiritualor mystical experience from ancient times and before. Cave paintingsof 32,000 years ago suggest transformative impacts. An archaeolo-gist interviewed in Werner Herzog’s film, Cave of Forgotten Dreams,suggests we be re-named Homo Spiritus rather than Homo Sapiens.Different approaches to transformations could be a seminar in itself.In the first O-gram (Bion, 1994b, p. 323; Appendix 4), O transmutesto Root, which transmutes to Instrument (tools), God, Stone, Lang-uage, Paint, and these give rise to music, religion, sculpture, poetry,and painting. You can make your own O-tree, expressing the creativeveins most meaningful to you. O runs through them, gives rise to allof them. Another meaning for O: One. Or Other. You might call itcreative spirit. But it is nameless. The One, the many. All creativeactivities of humankind branching from an unknown substructure.You are an O-branch made from O-processes. A paradoxical conjunc-tion or synchrony of One and Other.In the second O-gram (Bion, 1994b, p. 325; Appendix 4), O givesrise to Godhead and Analogues, which give rise to beta elements,which give rise to alpha elements, which give rise to pictorial imageand representation, which give rise to horse and ideogram. All ofthese processes point back, flow back to O.Between image and thing in itself, Bion posits unknown alphafunction, a meaningless term to note something happening that trans-forms perception through image to elemental naming. He calls namea hypothesis that bring things together. We are already thinking, feel-ing, sensing on the road to more thinking, feeling, sensing. Emotionalexperiences are expressed in myths and dreams, at once ideogramsCHAPTER ONE25"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"and narratives, with more abstract transformations ahead (see Bion’sgrid, 1994b, p. 295 and Appendix 5: Bion’s Grid).Meditation on Bion’s O-grams opens rich fields to explore, emanat-ing from unknown reality (Kabbalah: Ein Sof). For psychoanalysis,unknown emotional reality, which Bion describes as infinity: “Thefundamental reality is ‘infinity’, the unknown, the situation for whichthere is no language—not even one borrowed by the artist or the reli-gious—which gets anywhere near to describing it” (1994b, p. 372).How does psychoanalysis, which we are repeatedly told is a verbaltherapy, touch the infinite unknown, wordless reality? All kinds ofunknown emotional transmissions occur during therapy. You do nothave to be talking for them to occur. Your supportive presence, back-ground atmosphere, tone, and texture has an impact over time thatmight be more important than anything you say. The combination ofword and atmosphere are part of the soup, part of the ingredients. ButBion holds fast to the predicament that the basic reality we work with,partner, is unknown infinity: we nibble bits and pieces of unknowninfinite emotional reality. It is freeing to feel we are nibblers, some-times gulpers. Always qualified by more nibbles. We make our decla-rations, have our beliefs and convictions. We say you are this; you arethat. We use the DSMfor insurance companies and partly for educa-tion. But our declarations, beliefs, and categories are pimples of a deepemotional pull or presence that has no beginning or end and we donot know where we are in relation to “it”. We put ourselves at “its”disposal.Let me sum up some of overlapping themes in Bion and Kabbalah:catastrophe, Faith, intensity of affect, shatter, and transformation.Bion’s grid and O-grams are like inversions of the sefirot. If we hadtime, we could go into the sefirotand Bion’s grid and O-grams and seehow they relate. They are kind of upside down with each other, so tospeak. But the sefirotare all interrelated and all the parts of Bion’s gridand O-grams are interrelated. You can move upside down, downsideup, side to side and find intricate transformations and blends. Some-thing like the children’s song: Hashem is here, Hashem is there,Hashem is truly everywhere; up, down, all around, that’s where Hecan be found. (Hashem—The name, meaning God). There are appar-ently directional flows at a given moment, but if one looks closely onefinds swirls, other flows, multi-directional, everywhere at once. Maybethis omni-directionality is part of what makes people paranoid.26KABBALAH AND PSYCHOANALYSIS"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"In the time we have left, I would like to mention other aspects ofpsychoanalysis that resonate with the theme of shattering. InWinnicott’s (1992, Chapter Thirty-Four; Eigen, 1993, Chapter Eleven)“use of the object” portrayal, he depicts the baby destroying themother in fantasy. In a destructive fit, the baby is in danger ofmentally destroying the other. For Winnicott, much hinges on theoutcome of this drama. In the best outcome, Winnicott envisions themother surviving the baby’s attacks in a non-retaliatory way, main-taining her integrity as a person and not reactively collapsing. Shesurvives destruction intact, without falling apart, or diminishment, orinducing guilt. The mother goes through the experience with thebaby, coming through in a good enough way. This leads to the babyexperiencing a fresh sense of otherness. The other is beyond hisomnipotent control, is real, and this realness is nourishing and can beused for growth purposes.Not all outcomes are so optimal. We are all not as good asWinnicott’s mother. We deform, go blank, fall apart, get angry, afraid,helpless, vanish, self-erase, or disappear. I might not be too good atsurviving destruction in a particular moment. Sometimes, I cannottake very much and withdraw or freeze or go into hiding for a while,or say something uncalled for. But, in time, I regroup and come back.You might say I survive the patient’s destruction over time, if not at aparticular moment. I have gradually learnt to live my way into the factthat I might not be able to take very much, that attention comes andgoes. Sometimes, a patient thinks I am looking at the clock when Imight be fading out, staring around. But I do come back. Hello, I’mback! Sometimes, when someone catches on to me, she can see—oh,he’s back. If patients survive me long enough, they learn to cut meslack. They can get mad or express what they feel, knowing that Icome and go. We have to learn to cut each other slack if we are goingto survive each other. I do come back. That is our job. We can do that.We keep re-forming, re-shaping (Eigen, 1995).Meltzer (Meltzer, Hoxter, Bremner, & Weddell, 2008) describedwhat he called dismantling of attention in autistic children. Somethinghurtful happens and they are “gone”. Where do they go when theyare gone? Meltzer felt he linked an autistic child’s coming and goingwith separation anxiety: for example, the analyst’s forthcoming vaca-tion, a break in therapy, or other threat of leaving. Threat of breakingthe link between child and therapist transforms into stopping mind.CHAPTER ONE27"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Fear of the analyst’s leaving could precipitate “gone” states in thechild. It is hard to believe this is always so, but, even if it is sometimesor often so, a link is made between threat and dismantling of atten-tion, “gone” states. When threatened severely enough, mind disap-pears, goes blank, numbs, vanishes. My experience is that mindworking overtime is also a response to emotional pain or threat ofpain (in psychotic states threat is reality). Mind speeds up, becomeshyper-vigilant, as if searching for an answer, racing to find a way out.Speeding turns into fading away; racing—gone. Some autistic chil-dren spin round and round as fast as they can. “Normal” children do this, too. But, in autism, you feel something more desperate. Youfeel the mind whirring, then stopping. Children who spin might beenjoying an altered state, a different form of consciousness, for amoment transcending ordinary painful consciousness, sheddingmental skin, stopping life’s anxieties, dissolving boundaries and frus-tration. Perhaps these are some reasons why spinning tops are sofascinating.Meltzer’s link of separation anxiety with “gone” states resonateswith Fliess’s (1973) depiction of going blank when traumatic memorythreatens to appear, blankness as response to trauma. We find waysto dismantle attention in face of psychic threat. While it is importantto be able to link threat and loss of attention, much of the time thecoming and going of states seem more chaotic and haphazard. Often,you do not have a clue. Often, you come and go in sessions, and some-times you can make a link with how the patient is affecting you orthreats coming from your own internal states. At the same time, it canbe fruitful to have a sense of how your coming and going affects thepatient. Psychic threats go both ways. An important part of therapy isliving through mutual threats, absences, breaks in contact and hyper-infusions of contact. One of our great strengths, a virtue, is that we do,a good portion of the time, come back, whether it takes a week, amonth, a year, or a minute. We’re gone, we come back. We’re hurt, werecuperate. That is a rhythm we unconsciously model for the patient.They, too, break, come back.Winnicott (1992, Chapter Twenty-One; Eigen, 2004, Chapter Two)writes of going through a kind of breakdown and recovery insessions. The analyst does something that is experienced as traumatic,and the patient undergoes temporary breakdown. By the session’send, or some point in therapy, spontaneous recovery occurs. A28KABBALAH AND PSYCHOANALYSIS"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"rhythm of pain and recovery. Winnicott feels that in such moments wedip into mad states, disorganised states, and learn to come throughthem better. Therapy, in a way, is practice in going mad and being thebetter for it. Such moments can be precipitated unwittingly by thetherapist, for example, saying the wrong thing, being misattunedwithout knowing it, not being there.Winnicott told me of one such moment. A patient he had beenworking with for some time wanted to centre his image in her hand-held mirror. He was behind her, and as she tried to centre his imagehe could see it was off centre. He moved to help her get his image inthe centre of the mirror and knew immediately he made a mistake.The next time she came to see him she said, “You know, if thathappened six months ago, I’d be back in the hospital.” She had beenin and out of hospital and they were working on fragile areas ofpersonality. Enough had been done for the patient to toleratemistakes. It is important to be able to tolerate being off-balance. Whois balanced anyway?Perhaps this woman’s mother could not tolerate off-balancemoments that are part of raising a child. Perhaps she needed to be thecentre of her child’s life. Was Winnicott’s patient testing him, seeingif he could tolerate not being her centre, if he could tolerate her keep-ing him off balance? Such moments are often paradoxical, touchingdifferent tendencies simultaneously. Sometimes we need to toleratebeing the centre; sometimes we need to tolerate being off-centre, or,as Woody Allen portrays in one of his movies, “out of focus”. In focus,out of focus, in centre, off centre.Back to use of object, where the other is potentially thrown off bythe baby’s destructive fantasies, yet somehow comes back, reforms,survives, works with it, takes it in, thinks about it—all this mostlyunconsciously, distilled in a spontaneous feeling response. A rhythmof impact–response. This paradigm can be applied to many situationsand interactions: baby–mother, patient–therapist, political interactions,interactions between intimate partners. Clare Winnicott (personal communication) felt it described an important part of her and D. W.Winnicott’s marriage, how they lived. I would like to add what seemsto me a useful qualifying knot. It might be that a mother’s or partner’sor therapist’s response is off, a lot or a little, but then one adjusts one’sresponse, comes a little closer to getting it “right”, or better, or goodenough. There are variations in how we respond to each other’sCHAPTER ONE29"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"destructive urges, fantasies and expressions of the latter. Sometimes,we are better than others. Sometimes, we “get it”, sense the communi-cation, feel what is off and respond well. At other times, we miss theboat, whether from incapacity, fatigue, or our own reactive tendenciesand destructive needs. The mother tries this, that, a response does not work, still trying, a response works a little better, then a little better still. At last, the baby stops crying. I must have done somethingright, good enough.What is at stake is more than thinking the baby is hungry when itis wet, or wet when it is chilly, and the like. This is not about hungeror nappy or thermal states, although it could be. It is about feelingstates, attitudes, and disposition. I feel xand she thinks I feel y. I feelfrightened and she thinks I am happy. I am furious—can she bear myintensity? Can mother survive me and with what quality? Can wesurvive each other? Can we survive ourselves—can we survive ourown feeling life—and with what quality?Winnicott’s emphasis is on the other surviving my destructive feel-ings. If you are in a partnership with someone—a marriage, a deeprelationship—you are going to have to learn how to survive eachother’s destruction of you. Surviving destruction is a key, essential toa relationship surviving. The quality with which you survive eachother’s destructive needs is a key to the quality and evolution of therelationship. I remember André Green saying every relationship isconflicted—the only question is, does the conflict lead to growth ornot? Bion and Winnicott touch a core issue, destructive urges as partof relationships. Perhaps destructive urges and potential impacts arepart of every relationship. Is it destruction that can be survived witha quality that makes life worthwhile and enables growth?To complement Winnicott, who writes of the other surviving mydestructive urges, Bion (1994b, p. 104; Eigen, 2004, Chapter Two)writes of my getting murdered and being all right. Being murdered bythe other and being all right. That might not be an easy place to getto, but it is not an impossibility. You learn how to do it over the courseof your life, sometimes better, sometimes worse. Every process hasvariability. How to get killed, survive destruction, and still be therefor oneself and others. It is a freeing capacity to develop. It helps onebe freer from oneself as well as more able with others. It is a doubledestruction, a double shatter Winnicott and Bion are up to: yousurviving me, me surviving you. Me surviving your destruction of30KABBALAH AND PSYCHOANALYSIS"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"me, you surviving my destruction of you. I would add: me survivingme and you surviving you.If psychoanalysis contributed nothing else to the evolution ofpsychic life and culture, that would be more than enough. This basic,dual tendency in relationships has never been stated in such clear,succinct, and challenging ways, with elaborative fantasies to go alongwith these destructive fields. It is something psychoanalysis can beproud of. No other discipline that I know has done it so well. Psycho-analysis works with these tendencies and possibilities in one-to-onerelation over time, going through whatever one goes through. It is alearning that spreads, as Clare Winnicott pointed out, to the rest ofone’s life.If we had time, I would relate surviving mutual murder to thesephirot. For example, I am talking with my wife and she says some-thing that destroys me and I think, gevurahis flaring up, this can turn into a catastrophe. If I am lucky, there will be a quick flash oflightning, chochma, which, if channels open, runs through the tree, a redistribution of power, recentring, and in an instant, instead of becoming a monster, chesedcomes. From a moment’s fury andjudgement—how dare you say this about me!—to seeing it from theother’s viewpoint and saying, wow, I did not realise what an idiot I was being and now that I see it from her eyes, I see another pers-pective. A moment making space. (By gevurah, here I mean somethinglike judgemental fury; chochma, a kind of wisdom flash; chesedascompassion, loving kindness, mercy; all of these states comming-ling, offsetting each other, contextualising potentially destructivereactivity and enabling growth. For a diagram and discussion of the sephirot, see Appendix 1: Ein Sofand the Sephirot(The Tree of Life.)Psychoanalysis is about giving time and making space. Givingtime for these processes to begin to work. They are embryonic andtake time. Minute micro-processes, often invisible and inaudible, butthey grow over time. You have to give them time and psychic space.In Psychic Deadness(1996), I wrote about a lovely woman, a fine ana-lyst, who came for supervision. Her patient was suicidal and gettingworse. As we talked, it became clear that she could not identify withher patient’s dishevelled, messy, abject state. Her patient was not puttogether like she was and seemed to be oblivious to her progressivedeterioration, or could do nothing about it. In contrast, the therapistCHAPTER ONE31"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"was mess-phobic. I had fantasies of the therapist maybe coming towork with her hair a little dishevelled, not so perfectly put together.More deeply, it became clear that if she did not let in some empathyfor the mess, her patient’s shame would keep escalating. Shamewould kill her.One of the findings of Psychic Deadnessis that you can be too alivefor your patient. You can be too good for your patient. Self-hate canbe so huge, the mess so acute, catastrophe so bleak, that you cannotfind it or let it in. Or you might be more like me and find it but do notknow what to do with it. I seem to have a sensor that gravitatestowards the catastrophic, the poisonous. For me, it is intuitively obvi-ous. But how to be and what to do is another story. For my supervisee,the wrecked soul of her client might as well have been anotherspecies, another world. She would have to find a way to let downsome of her perfect aliveness or this patient would die.In Psychic Deadness, I write of a gradation, a continuum of alive-ness–deadness. With some people you have to become “deader” for along time. They say in Zen, be like a corpse. Or, in Kabbalah, contract,make space. Be patient, do not break the vessels. Or, if they break, beready to work with ruptures. We are being challenged, stimulated togrow capacities to work with breakage as part of our evolutionarytask. We are, over millennia, trying to learn how to work with whatwe break, or what breaks under the strain of life.Modulate your aliveness to fit the requirements of where you are,who you are with. If in a quandary, one supervisor told me, “When indoubt, wait it out.” That does not always work, but in the case I wasjust speaking about, the therapist kept trying to “push” the patient intolife, “analyse” her bad feelings about herself, encourage her. But thepush and encouragement and analysis came from another plane, a“higher” plane, not the living reality of the moment, places that needtouching, person to person, self to self. The term “understand” has asense of getting under, standing under. Getting under rather than overthe patient.Psychoanalysis is very good at shaming patients, adding to the badfeeling of not being better than you are. For Freudians, it used to be“making the Oedipus”. Being a “pre-Oedipal” person was more infan-tile, immature, undeveloped. For Kleinians, it was “making thedepressive position”. Moving from a more infantile, primitive para-noid–schizoid position to the “depressive”, where ambivalence is32KABBALAH AND PSYCHOANALYSIS"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"tolerated and one relates more as a whole person to whole people. Akind of “moralism” creeps into most schools with higher–lower,better–worse divisions. Words like infantile and primitive becometaunts. Therapy itself becomes persecutory.For me, Winnicott and Bion open further possibilities of being withpeople without “judging”, staying with realities of the moment. Ifshitty, not trying too quickly to turn shit into gold. Not being anOlympic god in the face of an anal mess. Can you “lower” yourselfdown, make yourself “smaller” and find the place that calls for findingnow? Too often, I get a sense of therapy persecuting a person: “Whyaren’t you related?” “Why aren’t you sexual?” “Why aren’t you?”Rubbing a person’s nose in what they are most ashamed of: disabilities,incapacities. This human tendency is not a monopoly of any one disci-pline. Marx saw it at work in the ways religions and the money machinefunctions. It could be widespread in education.One of my teachers years ago, Hymen Spotnitz, warned againsthelping to get a depressed person undepressed too quickly. He felt apoint at which suicide can come is when someone starts to feel better,then feels bad again. More important than the mood of the moment isgradual work in building resources. You can get someone to feelbetter, but that does not mean there are resources enough to handle abetter mood. Without resources to sustain better feeling, the fall downis more acute. You have to build, through gradual give and take, thecapacity to sustain ups and downs.We can share in the pride of having workers in psychoanalysiswho have made real inroads in perceiving and working with humandestruction. Learning to work with destructive tendencies is impera-tive not only for individuals, but for survival and quality of survivalof the species. There are many avenues of attempts to help. We havegood social workers trying to make the world a better place. Thisincludes social reformers and activists who try to make society morekind, less cruel. And social workers who help the lives of many inclinics and homes who are handicapped by financial disability andmassive social injury. Help on many levels is needed. But, without apsychic change in humankind, social action will lack the supportneeded for long-term sustenance.There is a lesson to be learnt from purist communities, semi-utopian communities that experiment with creating a better society insmall terms. Most of the ones I know about cracked over time becauseCHAPTER ONE33"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"of cracks in human nature. You cannot simply legislate or idealiserivalry, jealousy, self-centredness away. The “wild” thing, the animatething, wreaks havoc with idealised schemes. Changing outer struc-tures might have benefits, but without profound inner psychicalchange, fierce, self-centred tribal scenarios will manifest. What kind ofpsychical change is possible? How? Will we ever know how, or inter-mittently try our best, groping along, struggling with our nature. Thework psychoanalysis does in the trenches might be marginal in termsof world problems, but not marginal in the world of psycho-spiritualpossibilities. Attempts to learn how to work with our makeup, espe-cially destructive needs and tendencies, are valuable explorations ofhuman relationship. We are trying to learn something about how wedestroy each other and how to survive and grow through/withdestruction. Can we do it? To what extent? Even a little? And if so,will it spread? We do not know. It is an area that adds to the rebirthand renewal theme, a new twist on the theme of coming through hell:coming through one’s own and each other’s destructive tendencies ina better way. This, in part, is where therapy work takes us. Religiousdisciplines have tried to work with destructive tendencies. With whatresult is not clear. Mass destructions that have been part of religiousrivalry are sobering facts. Many individuals have been uplifted by thespiritual dimensions religions can cultivate, but bloody aspects ofwarring beliefs have been blood-curdling.Psychic work with destructive tendencies within a person-to-person therapy relationship: where can this take us? Kabbalistic exer-cises on aggression can be helpful at certain stages. There is the storyabout a man fearing his hateful urges towards someone undertakingthe study of Talmud and Zoharto learn everything he can aboutaggression. He became so immersed in his studies that his wrath anddestructive fears faded. Some exercises encourage a person to keepobserving, staring at his anger and seeing what opens. Others say,look away, substitute joy. Some say pay more attention, some saydivert yourself, find another way. But the detailed study of aggressiveurges? I am not sure there has been anything quite like it beforepsychoanalysis, although, as Freud said, poets—and I would add,spiritual disciplines—opened and continue to open many doors.It is nothing new to see aggression as part of our survival makeup,instrumental in mating, food gathering, territory, shelter, cross-fertili-sation of war. Some see it as a kind of cleansing, clearing out the old,34KABBALAH AND PSYCHOANALYSIS"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"bringing in the new, analogous to death making room for birth. Des-truction, too, can be a response to claustrophobia, an attempt to breakthrough the confines of life, the walls of personality: destruction asresponse to social claustrophobia, the squeeze of “civilisation”. A free-ing destruction, a fantasy that if I destroy everything, I will be free.My autonomous side seeking air. Freud, Klein, Winnicott, Bion,Bowlby, Reich, and Kohut are among those who make unprecedentedforays into labyrinths of destructive tendencies. If we never figure outthe most creative ways to meet the destructive side of our nature, it isnot a problem we are free to evade. Even digesting the possibility thatwe might face an unsolvable problem can open paths and vision.Let me stop talking. Any questions, feedback, fables? When we arein the realm of Kabbalah, we are in the realm of the fabulous.Similarly, when we read many of the sutras, we are in the realm of thefabulous. All kinds of things are said about Buddha that are adult chil-dren’s stories. Spirit journeys, soul journeys, mind journeys of awonderful nature. The basic discipline in Kabbalah is how to openyour heart, how to turn a heart of stone into a heart of flesh, openingchannels. A basic discipline in psychoanalysis is how to supportpersonality in life and help it face its attempt to destroy itself.Question: If the psychoanalyst builds her vessel for herself and herclient, how would you describe, Kabbalistically, how, as analysts, wecan hold a certain frame, a different kind of vessel, than we canprovide for our child. How do we explain that our vessel seems tohave greater strength and mobility when we are in a therapeutic modethan when we are parental, or just one in a group of people trying toget in line for something?Response: First of all, I have no explanations for anything. But therewill be people better at mothering than at psychoanalysing, especiallyif you are a new mother. My wife continued to practise for a while,and then she started getting phone calls after our first child was born.Betty, where are you? She just tended not go to sessions, she forgotabout them. And when she was in her sessions, she often was think-ing about her child. Eventually she stopped practising for a whileuntil she was able to think of both her children and her patients. So,it can work either way. We can be better with our patients than athome, or better at home than with our patients, and this can vary.CHAPTER ONE35"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"What we are talking about, in part, is psychic flexibility.

Incidentally, Bion writes of a thought frame orrhythm involving a thought or feeling appearing one moment, disap-pearing the next: here, gone; on, off; God, no God; self, no self; you,no you (I explore it in Contact With the Depths(2011) and in the Seoulseminars).So, metta.

You need to keep finding what works for you. Forme, it sometimes happens by seeing a face on the subway, someonewith a certain look that opens me. With my children and patients, thethawing moment ever changes. Sometimes I’m tired; sometimes I’mopen. Both Kabbalah and psychoanalysis say that there is a domain ofstruggle. You cannot escape having to work on yourself, sometimesholding back, sometimes opening. You develop a “body English,” aspiritual body English, a sensing through which your body thaws ortightens, depending on the need of the moment.I learnt many years ago, in the 1960s, that our bodies are muchtighter than they have to be, as if they are fighting off a threat. Oursphincters are tighter than they have to be in order to function. It is asif we are living under a state of threat. When you go home to yourfamily, threat increases. A paradoxical situation, since you think, ah,the nest, safety. Yet, the closer you are, the greater the threat. Mostmurders occur in the family. Work and home might provide differentamalgams of threat and safety.In my first major psychoanalysis, I complained about getting betterwith people in the “outside” world, but when I meet my parents, Izero out. Like the Zen master who meets the King and loses his Zen.36KABBALAH AND PSYCHOANALYSIS"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"I meet my family and my gains in psychoanalysis crumble. My analystsaid, “Your parents are the last people you’ll be able to relate to. Don’tworry about solving that now. Stick with growing where you can.” InBuddhism, “stick with your practice now.” Psychoanalysis becomes apractice. My analyst’s paradoxical communication was, if you flunkwith your parents, make the most of it. If you live with them or onyour own, use it as raw material to learn. Your family becomes an areaof practice. You try this and that, juggle the chakras, juggle the sephi-rot. You sense yourself too much this way, too much that way. Youmeditate, you pray, you pull back, withdraw, try again. You feel notonly the impact of the other on you. Some moments you sense whatthe other is asking for. Where are they coming from? Why do theyhurt me? What happened?Years ago, when I was dating, I could be with a girl feeling some-thing nice happening, and then she’d say or look or do just one badthing to me and, almost instantaneously, I’d get physically sick. Icould suddenly get sick by a glance or bad word. Not just momentar-ily ill, but lasting a week or two. When you are with someone thirtyyears, or fifteen, or five, impact multiplies. The impact of the other. Ilearnt through experience how vulnerable, how sensitive I could be inintimate situations, something I had to work with.Another variation involves contrast between alone states andimpact of the other. I am thinking now of a creative artist who spenthours alone painting. He could feel a rush of new realities unfoldingwith the movement of his hand, or plunge into an abyss when move-ment stalled. His mood would go up or down with the state of creativ-ity. Yet, the highs and lows were part of his alone reality, him and thework. When he had to put his brushes down, time for dinner withfamily, the crash was often more than he could bear. The transitionwas more than difficult. Suddenly, his family life seemed so trivial, abother that did not fit in with his creative meditative state at all. Hiswife and children were foreign bodies, noise, impingement. Thecontrast was bewildering. He wanted to escape back to his workalone, where he felt magically real. At the same time, he wanted to bewith his family, to share life together. A perpetual quandary. On theone hand, why can’t I stay in my meditative state forever? On theother, real life was calling. Being with other people was an incessantchallenge. He had to face the challenge of learning to work with tran-sitions and discover the possibility of softer landings.CHAPTER ONE37"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"We emphasised disaster, obstacles, difficulties.

The essence ofTorah and the essence of Kabbalah in that respect are the same.That is the essence: love God with all your heart and soul and might.I mentioned that it sounds like a commandment. You should, youwill, you have to. But it is more: you are. To love God with all you aredefines you. You are this love and in relation to this love.It is a discovery. If you make this discovery, if it happens, if itcomes to you that, oh, my God, I love You with all my heart and souland might, it is a fact. It is a fact not from the outside but from thedeepest inside. Schopenhauer says music is the deepest dream of theworld. You could also say this dream, this music, expresses this love.Last time I talked about my favourite historical and also fabledrabbi, Rabbi Akiva, and I will not be saying much about him today,but we talked about his kavannah, his devotion, and his awareness, hisfeeling at the end of his life when his skin was being taken off by theRomans that at last he was able to give God everything, love God with all his might, all that was in him, all that he was. In another partin the Bible it says love God with all your heart and soul and mind. So,there is a change from might to mind. They are both important and 39"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"it is a challenge. How can one do that? What is “all”? What would“all” be? Rabbis say with the good inclination and the bad inclination.Love God with good and evil inclinations. And what would that looklike?I counted how many intersections I could find between psycho-analysis and Kabbalah, at least the psychoanalysis I am interested in,and counted something like seventeen. It is impossible to do all ofthese today, but I picked a few and have a hunch that what I pickedmight not be for everybody, but if there are some who find it helpful,I will be very happy. One has to do with links between the v’ahavta—loving God with all your heart and soul and might and what that canmean, what all of you, all of mecan mean—and the centrality of faith inBion’s work.As I mentioned last time, Kabbalah is not one thing, more an arch-ipelago, scattered through time, perhaps starting a couple of hundredyears before the Common Era, maybe earlier. Gershom Sholem tendsto see it as a form of Gnosticism. Moshe Idel feels it has independentroots in the Torah, a meditation on the inner meaning of the Torah.Different geniuses of spiritual imagination related their perceptions,insights, and stories over many years. Like crumbs in a forest, we cantrace tracks through the ages of texts and presences.Often, stories and facts were confused. For example, it wasthought that the Zoharwas written roughly around 200 CE by Shimonbar Yochai, a devoted student of Rabbi Akiva. The legend was thatShimon bar Yochai and his son hid in a cave for thirteen years, escap-ing Roman persecution and death. While in hiding, Shimon barYochai was said to have formed the basis of what became the Zohar,in which he is a major character. Chasidim attribute writing the Zoharto him, taking a main character for its author. Shimon bar Yochai isrevered as a holy man and celebrated today.Scholars track the Zoharto a Spanish writer, Moses de Leon(1250–1305), who authored it as an act of creative, spiritual imagina-tion. He wrote it in a strange Aramaic under the pretence that Shimonbar Yochai was its author. A story has it that when he died, piousscholars came for the manuscript he claimed to mediate, but weregreeted by his wife saying, “Here it is. He made the whole thing up.”Apparently he felt his visions and reflections had a better chance ofbeing taken seriously if he attributed them to a saint like Shimon barYochai.40KABBALAH AND PSYCHOANALYSIS"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Fact and fantasy sometimes collide. Perhaps it does not matterwhether it was written in the third or thirteenth century. There is areligious tradition that Akiva transmitted an oral tradition to Shimonwho passed it on, its spirit resurfacing in Maimonides in the twelfthcentury, Luria in sixteenth century Safed, and the Baal Shem Tov ineighteenth century Eastern Europe. From this viewpoint, Moses deLeon is seen more as a redactor than original author. Whatever theliteral truth, it is not surprising that fable and fact intermix. That athirteenth century visionary would be drawn to a third century saintas his channel or “voice” is itself worthy of study. Whatever its back-ground, the Zohar (Radiance, Splendour) was written, and its impacton mystical Judaism was decisive. Luria, the Baal Shem Tov, andRabbi Nachman were among the many who studied it, and its fecun-dity grew. It was an evolutionary act of the mystical mind, one of aninfinity of evolutionary acts.Last time I talked about Lurianic Kabbalah and related the shat-tering of the vessels to Bion’s depictions of psychic catastrophe. Myemphasis today is going to be a little different. My emphasis is goingto be on faith, the centrality of faith, and, to make it sharper, I havepicked a Chasidic descendent from the Baal Shem Tov by two gener-ations, a great grandson, Rabbi Nachman (1772–1810) and his inter-locking with the twentieth century British psychoanalyst, WilfredBion. We will see how they light each other up or add to each other’slights. Nachman, in one of his passages, depicted the world as a kindof dreidel, a spinning dreidel. We will see if we can reap some insightfrom spinning minds, spinning spirits, spinning souls.The centrality of faith. Catastrophe is central to Bion’s thinking andLurianic Kabbalah. Bion envisions catastrophe at both the origins ofpersonality and psychotic processes. Psychotic processes are anexpression of catastrophic happenings. We, as the film Zorba the Greektells us, are catastrophes in our own life. We are catastrophic beingsand our sense of being a catastrophic being is often part of our mostintimate feeling.Bion writes, “When two personalities meet, an emotional storm iscreated. (“Making the best of a bad job” in Clinical Seminars and OtherWorks, 1994a). This sentence is attributed to Bion in 1979, the year thathe died. Not everyone feels this emotional storm when meetinganother person. Well-regulated people probably do not feel it, but I donot know too many of them. My guess is, if numbers are “normal”,CHAPTER TWO41"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"the catastrophic ones are more normal. Does it sound a little weird tothink of a sense of emotional catastrophe as normal?How do we meet emotional catastrophe? With what do we meetit? Bion answers: with Faith, capital F. For him, Faith is the psycho-analytic attitude, which he depicts as being without memory, expec-tation, desire, or understanding. To be without memory, expectation,desire or understanding—no one does that. It is not a possible state.But it is a direction one can aim at and it makes a difference whetherone moves along this path or not. To step out of these capacities, evenfor an instant, is freeing.Perhaps we are on multiple paths, one the ego as centre of the uni-verse, another without memory, expectation, understanding, desire.Filling up, letting go, different kinds of filling and emptying. Yourpoint of emphasis might make a difference in how you feel and lookafter thirty, forty, fifty years. Emphasising the faith path does notmean you are done with evil. No one is done with evil. Everyone isgood and evil. But it makes a difference how you approach yournature, how you relate to it. Faith-work plays some role in mitigatingegocentricity.The first Bion formula I want to give you is F in O, Faith in O. Ois a sign he uses for unknown, ultimate reality, here, unknownemotional reality. Why emotional reality? He feels emotion is a coreof human life. For example, he says the core of a dream is emotionalexperience, and mythic narratives express and organise emotional lifefor the group. One of our core concerns is how life feels to us, how lifetastes, a sense with varying levels of depth, from how life feels whenwe do or do not do something, to the scent and texture of existence.F in O. And O is unknown. It is the same unknown that Job faced.The same unknown Job came up against, cutting everything away,possessions, attachments, loved ones, leaving nothing but encounterwith God, contracting to a point of mystical vision: Oh my God—it isreal, You are real. Speechless awe, silenced by awe. One moment of Fin O.Rabbi Nachman also gets carried away, hit by the intensity ofexperience. Seeking and meeting God often involves oscillatingbetween megalomania and unworthiness, both fused and conflictual.Nachman felt he wanted to arouse in people an awe such as neverexisted before in the universe, an awe of awes never known before.Nachman felt this about many things. Sometimes, he went through a42KABBALAH AND PSYCHOANALYSIS"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"morning or day and felt, “Today I am living a day such as was neverlived before.” About death, the same thing: “I want to die a death suchas was never died before.” Nachman had very intense, magnified feel-ing and his feelings of unworthiness also were intense and magnified.In a significant way, life was ever fresh, ever in the process of birth.Faith in unknown emotional reality, ultimate unknown emotionalreality, never experienced quite this way before this instant, yet stillunknown and beckoning, vastly unknown, inexhaustible. Bion, fol-lowing Wordsworth, speaks of intimations, intimations that border onconvictions and lead to belief systems. We fight over beliefs. Beliefs,too often, substitute for ongoing originary intimations. Nachman andBion call us to get back to intimations of the unknown.Faith is deeper than belief. Belief is a way of capturing faith,taming it, putting it in a box. Faith explodes belief. Faith feelsconstricted by belief. At the same time, beliefs can try to give expres-sion to faith, lead to faith, deepen it, depending on function and use.Can you have a belief that does justice to faith?F in O is one Bion formula. Another is T in O, where T stands fortransformations that go on in O. F in O and T in O. Unknown trans-formations, perhaps unknowable. We sometimes think we feel orsense them, intimations, perturbations, rumbles, whispers. But we donot know what kind of transformations go on in O. Saying there aretransformations in O is itself a leap, hypothesis, narrative, sensing,vision. Diverse groups of people have this inkling based on certainexperiences. Buddhists talk about wordless transformations that go onoutside awareness, intentionality, and conscious control. O-transfor-mations, perhaps a sensing that something is happening and you feelsome of the results. A moment opens, an intimacy, a delicacy, real andelusive, not lived before (to resonate with Rabbi Nachman). An Asianteaching is that our thoughts, feelings, images, sensations are bubblesor waves arising from an unknown sea, an unknown presence.Chuang Tzu speaks of mysterious, unknown, elusive presence linkedwith transformations deeper than knowing. T in O.F in O supports T in O. Everyone say it: F in O, T in O. (The groupsays this several times, beginnings of a kind of mantra or chant.)Now let me introduce a villain. In the Punch and Judy show,Punch and Judy are having a good time, and woops—out pops thedevil. Bion has given the most dramatic formulation of the “negative”force that I have come across. It was waiting to be said. All theCHAPTER TWO43"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"medieval talk about the devil came close but could not quite get there.William Blake, too, came close.Freud, Klein, and Bion write of a destructive force or urge ortendency, a thread of destruction that they put tracers on. Destruc-tiveness in the human condition. They do not dodge it. They try to seehow it undergoes transformations: for example, its displacements,condensations, dissociations, projections, introjections, symbolisa-tions, idealisations, identifications, and more. Bion maximises thestakes by positing a destructive force that goes on working after itdestroys time, space, existence, and personality. This is a variation onan ancient theme, with its own particular thrust, but it joins a diffi-culty the human race faces: what can we do about our own destruc-tiveness? A force that just destroys; a dedicated inclination that feedson destruction. After everything is destroyed it feeds on the totallydestroyed state. It does not stop destroying. It is an eternal state, inWilliam Blake’s sense, when he writes that all states are eternal.Bion’s statement that a destructive force never stops links withFreud saying that the push of psychic energy is constant, drive pres-sure is constant. The latter might not seem constant, given ebbs andflows of experience, but Freud feels there is something to be gainedby supposing the pressure and stress of drives as constant. Bion envi-sions part of this constant push as destruction that never ends, avision that is hard to take, but sobering and, I fear, expressive ofdamage we do to ourselves and each other.I like to balance Bion’s depiction of a dedicated destructive forcewith Buddhism’s Kuan Yin. Kuan Yin is variously depicted as aBuddha or aspect of Buddha, a goddess, or a psychic or spiritual force.Kuan Yin cannot do anything but be compassionate. People pray toher for favours and when favours are granted, all she wants as rewardis for people to say, thank you. Do you ever find yourself saying thankyou for little things during the day? I am one of the peculiar ones whogo through the day saying thank you. This happens, that happens—thank you, often to no one in particular, in my heart or a whisper. Iam reminded of Melanie Klein’s book, Envy and Gratitude (1997), inwhich Klein depicts an inverse relation between envy and gratitude,the former making the latter difficult, leading to further personalityconstriction.We have the Kuan Yin principle, which seems allied with faith, anda force that never stops destroying: an endless meeting of destruction44KABBALAH AND PSYCHOANALYSIS"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"and compassion. What are we saying when we bring these twotogether or connect Bion’s F in O with his writings on an incessantdestructive force? Incessant faith, incessant destruction. Are we sayingfaith encompasses destruction, while destruction destroys faith? Arewe saying we have faith in something that destroys and keeps ondestroying us? That we are that destruction? That we are that faith?Can we say O is neutral, changing, giving rise to variety, now KuanYin, now destructive force, mixtures, fusions, antagonisms? I think ofJob again as a guide, a model, when he says, “Yay though You slay me,yet will I trust You.” What kind of faith is that? Everything is takenaway, nothing left, everything destroyed except one thing. If God tookaway everything from you except one thing, what would you wantleft? Yay though You destroy me, yet will I tust You.I think of Winnicott wanting to be alive when he died, faith deeperthan destruction. I want to make a double formulation: faith is deeperthan destruction and destruction is deeper than faith. I want them asone thing. Faith deeper than destruction; destruction deeper thanfaith. There can be no faith after the Holocaust. Yet there is, faithdeeper than the Holocaust, yet the Holocaust is deeper than faith. It isjust the way it is, if you can find it. It is not one way, it is not the other.It is both. And maybe there are lots of different relations to each other.Maybe they are in antagonistic relations, oppositional, maybe some-times synchronous, fused, sometimes oscillating, sometimes alltogether at once. Variable relations between tendencies, states, reali-ties, and capacities.Faith deeper than destruction, destruction deeper than faith.Nachman underwent the most severe torments and doubts withregard to his faith and, above all, a sense of distance from God. On theone hand, he felt close to God, and on the other hand, he felt far. Attimes, the distance was so huge that he did not see how he would everget close again. You find such feelings in the psalms. One moment thepsalmist cries, “Where are you God? You’ve left me and I’m in anabyss, in despair.” Then a reversal: “I go to sleep crying and wake uplaughing. You are back and I am happy. My soul dances, great is yourfaith.”Emotions rotate around God’s presence or absence. You leave meand I am in despair, total torment. When will you show Your presenceto me again? The time will come when You will come back and myheart will sing with joy.CHAPTER TWO45"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"I sometimes relate this to what I call Winnicott’s Z dimension. Whenmother goes away X time, baby tolerates it. When mother goes away X + Y time, mother comes back and baby has a harder time but is stillall right, although going through a number of intense emotions. Whenmother goes away X + Y + Z time, there is a permanent alteration of theself. When mother comes back, something does not come back in thebaby, something is changed, different. An abandonment of massiveproportions had catastrophic consequences. Nachman went throughthis over and over. He lived in the Z dimension much of his life. At thesame time, he lived in Heaven. He lived a catastrophic state far fromGod, and a joyous state close to Him.I do not know anyone who has not had dreams of being excluded.I am not talking about feeling excluded in your waking life, whichmost people in this room certainly must have felt or you would not begravitating towards me. Everyone has had dreams of being excluded,of exile. People not wanting you, you do not belong. It is the wayNachman felt with God. I belong with God and I am excluded. Godhas put me away from Him.Today, Nachman might be diagnosed bipolar but, free of suchlabels, he felt his emotional states were messengers, God’s messen-gers. In Nachman’s tales, like Kafka’s, messages were never delivered.Layer upon layer of complexity. Emotions as undelivered messages.Nachman lived for thirty-nine years. A short life, a lot packed intoit. I do not know if Nachman ever gave up on anything the soul askedfor. Emotions as undelivered would not deter him. Emotions as links,paths to the Deepest Unknown of All—faith deeper and greater thandelivery. The birth experience and path—what might today be calledprocess—was more than enough, if never enough. Never enough ismore than enough. Dayenu—a moment of God is more than enough.But there are many moments, never ending moments of undeliveredmessages always on the way towards delivery. Kafka called his wholelife an incomplete moment (Kamenetz, 2010).Faith deeper than exile, deeper than agonised distance from God,deeper than all ills. I suspect, for Nachman, there are ways in whichGod in the distance, perhaps, isdistance as well, distance so painful,so close. A hellish beauty in the soul, a poignant, piercing love.An example of Nachman’s persistence, insistence, was his trip toIsrael. He went, in part, because the Baal Shem Tov did not get there.The latter felt signs he encountered on the journey boded disaster and46KABBALAH AND PSYCHOANALYSIS"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"turned back. Nachman felt he was completing the journey for hisgreat-grandfather. Perhaps spiritual grandiosity or devotion or both,Nachman took it upon himself to make good for the Baal Shem Tov.He was always making good for souls, especially dead souls.He could see dead souls needing help and would try to free them,raise them to heaven. He would make amends. I will not recount nowall the vicissitudes of his trip to Israel, enriching in themselves, innerand outer obstacles heightened by spiritual vision and an acute senseof reality (Green, 2004). All the things he went through openedpsychological and spiritual doors.Now, I want to let you know that the first moment he set foot inIsrael, he felt he could leave. He did not have to stay a second more.He felt total elation; all his problems were over. Mission accom-plished.To hear someone say, “All my problems are over” rings a bell inme. Perhaps Nachman meant his tormented distance from God wasnow bridged. Such wonderful moments when everything seemssolved. I think of letters belonging to a World Trade Center suicidebomber, reassuring him that his heroic deed will raise him to heaven,personal torments gone forever. His problems will be over, no moredisturbances, no more tormenting personality difficulties. It is quite alure, quite a promise, all personality problems over. If one stays alive,the wheel turns, new moments arrive and difficulties reassert them-selves. So, for Nachman: one foot in the Holy Land and all problemssolved! I will forever be close to God, torment over. But moments,days, weeks later and another story begins, another mood, more workin the trenches.As might be predicted, Nachman did not instantaneously leave theHoly Land and his problems were not over. He became depressedwhen he realised that the latter continued. He went through thissequence, in one or another way, over and over. A moment thatdissolves all problems, and their depressing return with a little time. I hear this sequence in therapy. Someone goes from one loveaffair to another and the first moments are wonderful, everythingnew. The World Trade Center suicide bomber washed clean by right-eous devotional destruction, the lover made fresh by love. And thencrash.Do we ever learn that we cannot get rid of the psyche and itsdisturbances? It appears that Nachman misdiagnosed a difficulty orCHAPTER TWO47"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"was taken in by a spiritual high, forgetting, ignoring, or not caringabout its trajectory. A sense that now is all and all is solved gives way,in time, to the reassertion of a fuller psychic reality.One of the basic rug pullers Nachman obsessed about was guiltover sexuality. He was following aspects of rabbinic and kabbalisticliterature, which gives a sexual interpretation to Adam and Eve eatingthe apple. Guilt is itself the fall, punishment in itself. To have to beguilty over sexuality expresses enormous injury. There are religiousresponses, rules about sexuality, ways to hallow it, what is permitted,what not, its tie to pleasure and procreation, ways to tame or channelsuch a gift and villain. For some, achievement of abstinence, as goalor reality, becomes a path, a necessity.Little cupid, devil of sex. Is it really theprimary tormentor of lifeor one of a number? For Nachman, it was a torment that impelled himto try to eradicate the roots of sex, so as to uproot guilt. Can it work?If goodness is a goal of sexual transcendence, lack of sexuality doesnot necessarily achieve it. Nature and society perform experiments.Castrated men are not necessarily beneficent. If you get rid ofhormones that feed sexuality, a person still can be mean and vindic-tive. Bracketing sex does not solve the problems of personality. Youcan get rid of sex and still suffer torments, you can still be a devilhaunted by devils. Getting rid of sex does not solve the problem ofevil, or, in less moralistic terms, a destructive drive or urge ortendency.The problem of personality is not solved by focusing on one thing.Sex is pretty dramatic; it certainly captures attention. But often itmasks egocentricity, vainglory, and will to power. Our varioustendencies play important roles, contribute to the colour, complexity,and taste of life. But they go haywire, become destructive as well asgenerative. For most of Freud’s career, anxiety was associated withlibido. Towards the end, and especially as elaborated by MelanieKlein, anxiety was associated with a destructive force Freud called adeath instinct or drive. Can one uproot the latter? What would thatlook like?Many of you know the story of the kabbalist who bemoaned theevil inclination. He so prayed it would be extinguished that Godgranted his wish and when he awoke, much that made life breatheand pulse was gone. The destructive urge, too, feeds life, is part ofaliveness. And feeds guilt.48KABBALAH AND PSYCHOANALYSIS"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Homer begins the Western canon of literature with the word“rage” or “fury”. He did not begin it with “lust”. It was rage over acrime of lust, an erotic theft, one man stealing another man’s woman.Rage is so often close to a total, blinding feeling. We have phrases:impotent rage, helpless rage. Rage at injustice, but also rage at our willnot done, loss of control, power, not being the master. In a way,Nachman was victimised by incomplete analysis of the human condi-tion. It is easy to focus on sex, it is so obvious. But a deep aggressiveforce that is partly erotic, yet partly has its own trajectory? A destruc-tive urge at once erotic and anti-erotic?There are aggressive pleasures and an inner bent that goes beyondpleasure, a drive to destroy everything and keep on destroying. Satanwas assigned erotic and persecutory components, hating love, cursingexistence. What was his will and counter-will? How close does it cometo the destructive gradient Bion envisions? A destructive force thatdestroys itself and goes on destroying. We never hear that Satan, apersonification, destroys himself. Does Bion envision a destructiveforce that Satan could not have imagined?In Greek literature, hubris, in Catholicism, pride—close cousins.Bion has numerous complex formulations; one ought not to over-emphasise one taken out of context. A thread that runs through hiswork is that our personalities are problematic. Even our consciousnessis a problem. We are disturbances to ourselves. As a baby, I go in andout of consciousness. I cannot take too much consciousness. I sleep,wake, sleep, wake. Suzuki spoke of dozing, waking as an old man, notresisting dropping off, coming back. He compared his state as an oldman to a baby in this regard. Of course, he kept speaking and writingin old age as well. I remember Harold Boris in his dying year writinghis two best books. He could not stay awake long. He would sleep,wake and write, sleep. I once heard Elizabeth Sewell say that sheknew when she was thinking because she had to go to sleep after-wards. It is hard work to support consciousness. It is hard beingconscious. Some sages say we are rarely conscious. Some feel we needto work to achieve consciousness even when we are “conscious”(sometimes called “sleep-walking”). If Einstein said he thought onlyonce in his life, where does that leave the rest of us?Consciousness is hard to support. Bion brings out how intensity of experience is hard to support. Psychic life is hard to support. Wehave evolved unevenly. We evolved in such a way that we can haveCHAPTER TWO49"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"experiences of great intensity but lack equipment to support them.Our experiential products are ahead of ability to digest them. It is asif what our personality produces is too much for us. Our experientialcapacity is too much for us, too much for itself. We lag behind ex-periential possibilities. Freud says we die from our conflicted charac-ter wearing us down. From Bion’s perspective, it is more that we lackequipment to support the amazing capacities we have. Such support,if it is desirable or possible, requires further evolution.As of now, we cannot take too much of ourselves and, as a result,evacuate ourselves in all kinds of ways. We use ourselves creativelyon the one hand, but also try to get rid of ourselves, as if the pain ofaliveness is too much. Scott (1975) wrote about a conflict betweenwaking and sleeping. A tension that applies, also, to living and dying,reflected in ebbs and flows of more and less aliveness through a dayor lifetime, moments of realisation punctuated by taking time outfrom oneself.The problem of lacking sufficient support for our experientialcapacity marks a more general difficulty than pinning our problemson sex or aggression, although the latter are not problem free. Weneed to meditate on our insufficiency in the face of our own capacitiesrather than blame one or another of the latter for our problems.Blaming sex and aggression distracts us from the unevenness of ourevolution, our not knowing what to do with ourselves. We seem tohave a blaming propensity that is contagious: it is your fault, it is myfault, it is its fault, assigning simplified causality when situations areimponderably complex and tangled. Maybe it is just us and our partic-ular unevenness of evolution that we cannot take too much of. Wehave to learn how to partner ourselves, even if it takes thousands ofyears. Maybe we should stop thinking in terms of trying to pin the tailon the donkey and try to work with the system as a whole.Let me retell a tale from Kafka. It is about a man seeking the law.He meets a doorkeeper who refuses him admittance. The man won-ders if he can go in anyway, but is told that even if he succeeds, hewill meet worse doorkeepers. The man exhausts his powers, butcannot gain access. Finally, his vision darkens. Is he dying? Is it reallygrowing dark? Yet, as it grows dark, he sees radiant light shiningthrough the door he cannot enter.Light shining through darkness when all is exhausted is an ancienttheme. The Kafka story emphasises frustration, law and light beyond50KABBALAH AND PSYCHOANALYSIS"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"the power of man to embody, always just beyond reach. Yet, there isa hint of radiance. I am tempted to say the Light is our centre, as wellas just beyond reach. For Kafka and Nachman, a distance element,tantalising or grim, is crucial (Kamenetz, 2010). Something holds theman fast, a promise of the law, a coming of light. For Nachman, devo-tion. For Kafka, I am not so sure, perhaps a yearning, a need, a refusalof anything less. Lack as illumination, uncompromising lack throughwhich radiance glows.Law and radiance, hidden radiance. I think of one of AndyStatman’s CDs, The Hidden Light. Andy Statman is a clarinet andmandolin player and follower of Nachman. Much of his music givesexpression to Jewish mysticism. Once a year, he plays his clarinet atRabbi Nachman’s grave in the Ukrainian town of Uman, where thereis mutual infusion of spiritual power, grace, joy, devotion, sadness,and light.But there is more to Kafka’s story. The man does not have muchlonger to live after seeing the light. What strength he has left con-denses into a question: everyone seeks the law. Am I the only one whotried to come in? Why is no one else here? The doorkeeper called theman insatiable, but answers, No one else is here because this is yourdoor, yours alone, meant only for you. Now I must shut it. And thedoor closes as the man dies.The doorkeeper called the dying man insatiable. It is not sex andaggression that is insatiable, but a burning for contact with Law andLight, a need to reach home base, a drive towards the Nourisher ofAll. The door closed forever is a real emotional nucleus in Kafka’s life,the door meant solely for me, closed forever. A real state that Kafkaexplored in his stories: barred forever.At some point, Kafka was taking Hebrew lessons and thinking of going to Israel, perhaps only a fantasy. But something stirred,turned on by Ruach Elohim, the Holy Spirit. A deep double state: faithdeeper than faithlessness and faithlessness deeper than faith. Adouble reality.Now a few more words about Nachman. As a child, Nachmanspoke to God in heartfelt pleas. Some people stumble on God as chil-dren. Not the church or the temple—God. It just happens. People tryto contain this happening with ritual and magical thinking. Mosescontained his Vision, his Meeting, with Laws. Wherever there is a law,there is someone who cannot obey it. For example, Kafka’s man whoCHAPTER TWO51"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"cannot go through the door cannot reach and live the law. Nachmanspoke to God with his heart. Do you remember speaking to God withheartfelt pleas—with tears? I sure do, but histories and sensibilitiesdiffer.Nachman developed speaking to God with his heart as a method,a kind of psychoanalytic method. He poured his heart out, all hisfaults, pains, misgivings, needs, and hopes. Outpouring that becamea method, a method of prayer and inner growth. He differed frommany religious authorities in that he advocated speaking your inmostfeeling with any language that is natural to you. If the holy language,Hebrew, the official prayer language is not natural, speak in Yiddish,the prevalent tongue of his people. Speak in your native tongue, realand personal as you can. When I went through my most serious,orthodox phase, a rabbi I worked with, realising where I was comingfrom, said read the Bible in English. Pray in English. I grew into someHebrew, some became part of me. But there is no need to pretend infront of God. He knows English is my mother tongue. There is noth-ing wrong with crying in English. Do not worry about the officialprayers. Just make contact. For Nachman, heartfelt prayer was a pathall life long.More, he practised and taught his students not just a weepingheart, but a broken heart. To break your heart in speaking with God.I think of the prophets: turn your heart of stone to a heart of flesh. Onereason I likened Nachman’s “method” to psychoanalysis is becausepsychoanalysis is called a “talking cure”. It is far more complex andsubtle than this. But speaking is a big part of it. Saying whatevercomes to you, feeling whatever comes, giving it voice. Nachman’sbroken-hearted speaking was like that. He was like Kafka in so far ashe felt no matter how he poured his heart out, God did not notice himat all. He spoke, but was not heard. Over and over he had the experi-ence of emotions not being met, perhaps like a baby whose cries arenot heard, whose feelings meet oblivion. It seemed to him he wasalways pushed away as though he was unwanted.The feeling he came up against often appears in dreams. In myexperience, most people have dreams of being left out, unwanted,exclusion, exile, aloneness. Nachman maximised the feeling: utterlyunwanted. Days and years pass and still he was far from Him, nosense of nearness at all. This state reminds me of the dying Jesussaying, “Father, why have you forsaken me?” What are Nachman and52KABBALAH AND PSYCHOANALYSIS"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Jesus finding? Not just destitution, but a most profound dimension ofaloneness as part of the human heart.The state Nachman undergoes requires sensitive thought. Nach-man had a deep sense of intimacy with God, an unconscious, some-times conscious or semi-conscious, nearness. Part of his sense of lackof nearness was that there could always be more nearness. His inti-mate nearness with God could not be exhausted. More was alwayspossible. He could never be near enough. It is said that as the sageprogresses, smaller and smaller “faults” seem bigger and bigger. Inpart, it might be something like this with Nachman: the sweetness ofnearness made distance more painful. That there can always be morenearness magnifies distance. To be near is to be far. He would not betormented by the nearness he did not have if he did not already tastenearness. He would not know to pray for a capacity that did not exist;more likely, he prayed for something he wanted more of. He couldnever have enough. I suspect his lack of closeness was more intimatethan my greatest sense of nearness.Nevertheless, we ought not minimise the state he expresses.Agonising distance from the Beloved, the Centre, the Place (Hama-kom), becomes a path, a gate. Nachman did not budge. He refused toabandon his abandonment. He did not leave or escape for long the farfrom God moment. Reassurance did not help. He stayed with it andstayed with it year after year. I think of Bion speaking about certainemotional experiences as an unsolvable problem. What can you dowith emotion as an unsolvable problem? Sit with it. Pay attention.Wait. If you sit with it without giving in to distracting “solutions”, theproblem might not change, but you will.Nachman, at times, became depressed when, in spite of all hisheart-rending pleas, no attention was paid to him and he remained farfrom God. Yet, if farness is what he felt, it became a link with the MostIntimate of All, the One who is closer to me than I am. Depression aslink in response to loss of link. I am not suggesting you follow yourdepression to the bitter end, the very beginning, if that were possible.Nachman’s path will not work for everyone. What I am suggesting, ifless severe, still is challenging and freeing. Let in the state, in this case,distance, separation, loss, not having. It is a relief not to have to keepit away. One does not have to fight one’s states or make believe theydo not exist. To be able to let a feeling in and say, this is so, this is partof me, the way things are, the way I feel. A relief not to have to makeCHAPTER TWO53"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"believe it is not so. I do not have to fill the void with fillers just so itwill be full.At low points, Nachman would cease his private prayers for anumber of days, then be overcome with shame for having called thegoodness of God into question. What is this basic sense he has, thebasic goodness that keeps on going down the tubes and recurring? Hecannot get rid of basic goodness and he cannot hold on to it. He wouldbegin again to plead as before. This sequence happened many times,a kind of basic rhythm. Not quite loss of faith–return of faith, butsomething like it. A decline of something important and refinding orreminding: loss of and refinding contact, dedication, renewal.Nachman remarked that he was in a constant state of renewal.***INTERMISSION***[There was a jump in the recording, so some of the seminar is lost.]As a child, Nachman kept his dilemmas and problems hidden. It wasas if he nursed himself a long time in a kind of psychic womb. In part,he felt his inner concerns would be damaged if they were aired. Noone would understand. More, he felt what he was going through wasbeyond understanding. People would try to talk him out of it—it isnot so bad, you will grow. He learnt at an early age that if you havedeep intense states, people will try to get you out of them, minimisethem, sweep them away. So, he kept them to himself. Psychoanalysisand esoteric traditions share concern with something hidden.Kabbalah purports to give the hidden, true, secret meaning of theTorah—the real meaning. And Freud purports to reveal what ishidden in the psyche. He calls the id the true psychic reality. Concernwith secrets—something Kabbalah and psychoanalysis share.It took Nachman a long time to come out and try to be the sage,the tzadikhe felt he was. He would intermittently come out and thenwithdraw. In one state, he felt there was no revelation like his revela-tion. He felt he was the tzadik hador, the tzadik of the age. Other tzadikspaled by comparison, he was the one who really knew. In anotherstate, he felt he knew nothing, was utterly unworthy. When he wasyounger, he shied away from controversy. He felt that controversywould damage you if you were not ready. On the other hand, he felt54KABBALAH AND PSYCHOANALYSIS"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"that if he revealed his teachings, people would faint. Who was readyto hear and bear the truths he knew? Like Kafka, he asked that hisunpublished writings be burned after he died. Perhaps he feared theywould be misunderstood and misused. No one was ready for thesecrets, the revelations about the nature of our lives and our relation-ship with God. Something is trying to be born, but birth must not berushed. Not an easy dilemma: to nurture the experiential, emotionalwork, the messengers, in secret, or enter public controversy and riskinjury. A tension between gestation and delivery.When Nachman revealed himself, he felt his teaching had no peer.He had an expansive aspect as well as a self-denigrating one. He sawother tzadikim, wise people, as finding their niche, their level. He, onthe other hand, could not stay in a niche. Every moment he felthimself another person. Teachers entered into controversies from theirniche. Since Nachman kept changing, reaching new levels, controver-sies that followed him could never end. In this state or attitude,Nachman wanted no hour to pass without further movement,constant struggle a path, necessary for growth, enabling him to movefrom place to place, opening heaven. Not only struggle with otherteachers, but his own nature, sexual nature, for example. Whenstudents complained of exhaustion, he might reply that he wouldmake peace if there were not spiritual places that could only be foundthrough struggle.Nachman noted that controversy was everywhere, betweennations, within a family, individuals, groups. He felt all controversieswere one, flowed from one source. In psychoanalytic terms, we mightsay they flow from us, from human nature, our makeup, our mix oflove and aggression and much more. Sometimes the mix is moredestructive, sometimes more generative. For Nachman to liken fightsin the family to fights between groups outside the family shows keenpsychological vision. He keeps his eye on fighting and its transforma-tions. If we look at human history, fighting is one of the constants.Who fights whom changes, but fighting as an emotional link is aninvariant. Wars continue although who fights whom over what shifts.It is the fact of war that Nachman puts a tracer on, whether in fami-lies or nations or oneself.Even those who try to stay out of quarrels succumb. I think ofpatients who want peace. One meditates, another is lost is painting,deep immersion. They reach a place where it seems as if family frictionsCHAPTER TWO55"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"would be resolved. As one person said after an afternoon of peace, “Ifelt that now things would go better with my wife and kids.” It tookonly a few minutes at the dinner table for all hell to break loose. We feeldifferently in different states, running the gamut of war and peace.Nachman suggests that if war is in self, home, and nation, anyplace we can make a difference might affect other places. If we becomeless warring at home, will nations war less? I do not know about that.But at least home might become a little less of a war zone. Perhapsworking with our emotional nature at any level can affect others. Myhope is that every bit counts. But does it? It matters to me. Is thatenough? Is there ever enough? If my life can be a little better, doesn’tthat count, too? What about the belief that if you affect anything at anylevel, you affect the whole cosmos?One more remark on Nachman and war. He notes that if a mansitting alone in a forest goes mad, it could be because all the warringparties are now within. There are no others outside to divide theaggressive impulse with. Fighting with others saves us from goingcrazy, saves us from facing the aggression within. It is not just lack ofcontact that makes us go mad, but all the warring nations inside with-out any place to go. We are torn apart by ourselves. We can be grate-ful to our family, neighbours, nations for keeping us sane. We needsomeone to fight with.On another note is the extravagance of Nachman’s “highs”. He feltthat people would pass out if they heard his teachings. The world wasnot used to such high spiritual levels. The music of his teachingswould evoke such longing and rapture that the whole of nature wouldsing in fulfilment beyond itself. All would faint in rapture as the soulof every being flew to height after height. This reminds me of a rootmeaning of ecstasy, to pass out of oneself, go beyond or outsideoneself, “beside oneself”. A sense of “crossing over” is part of manyforms of spiritual experience. In Buddhism, there is “crossing over” ofsamsara to nirvanna (the “other side”). In the Bible, crossing over ariver to another level of life is a recurrent image, from Abraham on,perhaps starting with Adam and Eve.Nachman gives examples of everything singing. The land sings, thegrass sings, each bit of existence with its own song. He talks about whysome shepherds were musicians, like King David. The shepherd hearsthe earth singing and through his own song nourishes plants for hisherds. Plants and flowers grow through song. The song of the shepherd56KABBALAH AND PSYCHOANALYSIS"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"includes the song of all beings and opens new possibilities. When askedhow to answer an atheist, he answered, by song. Nachman had a mag-nificent sense of beauty and nature and song. There were periods whenhe felt that dancing would raise the souls of those who could not do itfor themselves, and he would do nothing but dance. It was said thatsometimes his dance was so still, so inward, you could not see himmove. Stillness and movement were both important to him.He travelled a lot, mirroring his restless soul, not content withwhat he achieved for long, sensing more. He uprooted his familydepending upon need or intuition. One never knew where the spiritwould lead. He was run out of one town for criticising the local tzad-dik. Nachman claimed hewas the real tzaddik, the tzaddikof the age,taking spiritual life to levels the local rabbi did not reach. He foundhis way to a town called Bratslav and became known as Nachman ofBratslav, where he established a school and had followers, before hewent to Uman, where he is buried.There were periods in Bratslav when clapping hands becameimportant to him. Prayer should make you feel like clapping hands. Ifhe did not hear clapping, he wondered if his students were reallypraying. Praying with one’s whole being could take so many forms.Through a broken heart and a singing heart, through confession,struggle, dance, and clapping. The sound of one hand clapping? Oneuniverse clapping? All hearts breaking, singing, dancing, clapping.When asked how to answer an atheist, he said, “Think about thedepths of prayer, a moment your prayer was answered.” In the depthsof prayer, prayer itself is the “answer”. It is not only a matter ofprayers coming true, but of prayers being true. Certain moments ofprayer open the deepest truths, often beyond words.A young man comes to his father, a rabbi and asks, “Rabbi, can youtell me how I can achieve what you have achieved?” How can he reachthe spiritual place his father has? His father gives him texts to read.The son reads everything he was given and more, eager to search andgrow. But he does not find what he is reaching for. Again he goes tohis father and this time says, “Tata, I’ve read everything you gave meand I have not come close to finding what I am seeking.”This time, the rabbi answers as a father, as tata. “When I read all thisI did not find the Source of All Life either. Here is how it happenedfor me. When I was a young man, the Baal Shem Tov was speaking inCHAPTER TWO57"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"a town not far from mine, so I went to hear him. As I was walking, ablizzard came. My shoes were useless, my coat thin. I was afraid Iwould freeze to death. I was exhausted, I could not move. I cried andcried. Even in the blizzard I could not stop my tears. Before I knew itmy tears became a prayer, “God, I can’t move. I can’t take anotherstep. Please, please, help me hear the Baal Shem.” At that moment, ahorse and carriage came into view and brought me to the town. Ifollowed lights in the windows to a little place that looked like a shul[house of worship and study]. The Baal Shem seemed to be waiting forme and said, “See? Your prayers are answered.” The son understood.It was not from books but life, the prayer life is, that one lives the truthof one’s being. (Paraphrased from Schachter-Salomi & Miles-Yepez,2009, pp. 130–131)The rabbi highlights a moment of desperation, prayer as outburst,outcry. It is not a luxury, frill, or decoration, but a lived moment ofdread, loss, and love. Nachman generalises this moment as a path. Hetells his students, speak from your heart in your own words, yourown language. Speak in any way that breaks your heart. Speak yourheart out to God. Words and tears from the depths of your life.Nachman felt that descendents of the Baal Shem Tov had a specialcapacity to pour their hearts out to God because they were descen-dents of King David, whose psalms were such an outpouring. WhenI was being taught at Crown Heights in Brooklyn by the two old menI mentioned, they would say that the Messiah carries King David’ssoul and that there existed in our time someone who could carry thatsoul, their Rebbe Schneerson, but it was not happening. And thoughthey were enjoined by their religion to expect the Messiah daily, theyfelt it was not likely to happen in their time, for whatever reason, buthoped it would in my time. Their sense of reality triumphed overwish-fulfilment, but the dream remained alive.Let me summarise again three of the paths Nachman taught andlived: constant struggle; dance and song, music, beauty; and speakingfrom a broken heart.Now, a few more notes to give a flavour of Nachman’s life andteachings, with particular focus on emotional flavours. Feelings dohave flavours, colours, sounds, and we have psychic taste buds.There was a time when Nachman tried to attract students by goingon retreat with them, living in the woods. The Baal Shem Tov lovedbeing in the woods. Not only did he pray and meditate in the woods,58KABBALAH AND PSYCHOANALYSIS"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"but the woods itself was a kind of prayer. Nachman enticed some tocome with him. He thought students might have a better chance ofopening spiritual reality away from the routine they were used to.Parents of those who left home to follow Nachman did not appreciatethis. Nachman tried many things to whet spiritual appetites.One of his models was the biblical Abraham. A story is thatAbraham went from town to town running through the streets, some-thing like a madman in an alarmed, aggrieved state. This causedpeople to run after him to help him. Abraham used this as a ploy totalk about God. He was very persuasive to some and able to arguewith many. Nachman, too, would do most anything to bring peopleclose to God. Although such extraordinary means had their moments,they were not, on the whole, very successful. But Nachman’s expres-sive attempts gradually strengthened his sense that he was the tzadikofthe age, one who can see the needs of each soul, whose soul containedall souls and, by an intuitive sense, unlocked the souls of others.A variation of the soul that contains all souls, is a sense that thetzadikcontains what each soul lost by being born. Before conceptionand birth, each soul knows, and with birth “loses”, awareness of whatit is to do in life. Life partly is a search for what is lost at birth. Thetzadikbecomes a conduit, uniting souls with what they lost, so thatthey can come closer to fulfilling their missions. To do this, the tzadikmust first find his own loss, a process that enables him to find thelosses of others. An outcome is that the tzadikis a depository of every-one’s losses. One finds one’s own loss through the tzadik.Here is another of the affinities between Nachman and psycho-analysis. We noted that Nachman’s outpouring of the heart, saying allto God, has some resemblance to free association. There are ways ofspeaking whatever is in one that lead to growth. In Nachman’s depic-tion of finding one’s loss through the tzadik, we have a glimpse ofFreud’s emphasis on the analyst discovering within himself what hecan help others find. We are aware, too, of how each person helps theother, journeys in mutual help.[Question is asked that the tape did not pick up.]There are lots of stories, myths, fables in Kabbalah. One that informsa thread that we are touching involves shattering of the vessels—Lurianic Kabbalah. Bion mentions Rabbi Luria, whom he describes asa carrier of the messiah–genius function. Bion contrasts what he callsCHAPTER TWO59"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Establishment with Genius–Messiah aspects of personality, tensionsbetween more conservative and more creative forces or tendencies inoneself, in groups, in society. Luria and Jesus are among those he citesas special carriers of the genius–messiah function, a creative functionthat breaks new ground in human vision and experiencing.Luria was born in Jerusalem in the sixteenth century, studied inEgypt, and, through discussions with teachers from the distant past,including Elijah, he moved to Safed, Israel, where he mined his spiri-tual talents. Luria suggested that to make room for creation, Godcontracted. If God was everywhere and filled existence, how wouldthere be room for the world and others? If God were merely expan-sive, would there be space for us? God’s contraction creates a voidmaking creation possible. Jacob Boehme, a German mystic, about fiftyyears later, also posited that God contracted to make room forcreation. Luria, born in Israel, also had German roots. There were,across time and space, certain affinities between Luria and Boehme.In a way, their logic, that God contracts to make room for creation,is lovely and fruitful as an image, but a curious curtailing of God. IfGod can do anything, God can fill all space andmake space for exis-tence (Chapter One, “Distinction–union structure” in Contact With theDepths, 2011). That God is everywhere andthere is room for us is partof the mystery of creation. One need not posit a void for God to create.Yet void, or something like a void, is an important part of experience.And if God could do anything, God could contract, shrink, create avoid. God couldhold back to make room for us, although He did nothave to.To hold back and make room. By holding back, although He didnot have to, God demonstrates an important moment: making roomfor others is an important capacity to develop. Often what we sayabout God pertains to aspects of our own makeup. If we were onlyexpansive, we often would miss each other, we would not hear or seewhere the other was in a full sense. I often think of contraction as akind of bow, making room for the other. Luria’s spiritual imaginationabout God’s relation to us opens possibilities about our relationshipto each other and to our own self. For it is especially important thatwe also make room for ourselves.Luria takes difficulties of creation to other levels, vision uponvision. Not only does God contract, but a contrary, expansive move-ment occurs within this contraction. An expansive movement that is60KABBALAH AND PSYCHOANALYSIS"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"meant to be contained, breaks through containment. God’s emana-tions break some of the vessels meant to mediate the former. Godcould not contain His own energy. Some of the spheres mediatingGod’s life (or power, force, energy, intention) broke. Higher spheresremained intact but lower spheres shattered under the impact. Higherand lower spheres or dimensions are depicted by the SephiroticTree,the Tree of Life, which charts flows of divine power through diversecentres, for example, will, wisdom, understanding, compassion,strength, beauty, down through the lower spheres having to do withaction in our world (Appendix 1, “Ein Sofand the SephirotTree ofLife”). The latter shattered under divine impact, with the implicationthat our world is, in a profound sense, shattered existence. TheShekinah, God’s presence in our world, is depicted as feminine, yettorn. Our job is to help repair broken existence, heal earth’s destiny,repair the broken vessels of God that transmit God yet create us. Somesay our job is to help heal God and His Presence in the world, whichinvolves healing ourselves.The lower spheres are where we live, emotions in action. God issomething like a two-year-old in a nursery, not knowing his ownstrength or impact. Things break. Dare one say that God is like a babywho does not know what he is doing? These images express feelings,our own relationship to the new. When we learn about somethingnew we have to feel our way into relationship with it. In this vision,God is a beginner when it comes to creating our universe and us andhas to learn what to do with the Powers he “uses”, the Power he is.God is too much for his own energy. Perhaps he did not contractenough. Perhaps he cannot contract enough. Perhaps we are alwaysin danger of uncontrolled outbreaks of godly energy. Creative energywas too much and spheres attempting to contain and mediate it broke.One of Bion’s resonant themes is the importance of catastrophe inpsychic life and difficulties involved in tolerating creative andemotional intensity of many kinds, a theme I hope to return to later.Seminar member:The relationship between God and us is reciprocal.The breaking of the vessels teach us to make room for God. In theJapanese art of bonsai, the miniature plants, the plant is never plantedin the middle of the container, it is always planted off-centre, becausethe centre is reserved for God. So, to learn that in one’s own heart,there has to be something reciprocal, there has to be a nothingness toCHAPTER TWO61"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"make room. I think the message of Luria is that if God could do this,then we can do this, too.Response:That would be another ray in the circle (Appendix3: “Circle and rays”), a positive ray. In the particular ray Luria delin-eates, brokenness, shatteredness becomes part of existence—pain,wretchedness, misery, suffering. One does not get around the fact ofsuffering. Yet, you are right to point out the importance of makingroom, working towards making room, which is part of learning, partof enlightenment. Luria adds to this a vision of buried sparks, divinesparks buried in brokenness and nothingness. Sparks that we canmine and help to release. Divine sparks buried in our own existence,our own psyche, our own lives.An aspect of reciprocity is learning to become partners with ourcapacities. To let the work of enlightenment sparks release us. Divinesparks work in us, help in transformation. Buried sparks as creativepotential, sparks of our own life, of divine potential. Winnicott, recall,speaks of a vital spark that is part of an infant’s being, needing to beshepherded. Kabbalah teaches that we need to help release trappedsparks. Bear in mind, too, that these “sparks” work on us, in us, asstimuli of transformation. Bion writes of Transformations in O. Wespoke about this earlier. A lot of transformational work goes onoutside our awareness. The sparks themselves are busy helpers, partof the “material” of transformational processes. For example, in medi-tation, we often sense something going on, although we cannot saywhat. Something is happening, something in us is giving way, open-ing, changing, although we cannot pin it down. This is but one exam-ple of Transformations in O, work going on in psychic reality, elusivebut making a difference.Nachman, roughly two hundred years later than Luria, appliednotions of higher–lower to teaching, how to talk to people. Kabbalah,like Aristotle and Plato, speaks of higher and lower functions, spiri-tual planes, levels of existence. Nachman was always trying to reachhigher spiritual levels. In Nachman’s terms, to be closer to God, onegoes higher and higher, opening heavenly dimensions of soul. Onecould say this is a way of speaking, a way of giving expression to feel-ing, to inner facts or possibilities. God is not localisable up or down,right–left, here–there. God can be thought of as an inner point within,or no point anywhere. Judaism says no name or image will do. One62KABBALAH AND PSYCHOANALYSIS"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"could say there is a Greek influence in much up–down Kabbalisticthinking and vision. At the same time, up–down is a language relatedto our body, upright posture, head (eyes) over the rest. As a way totranscend or complement the upright and visual dominance, Bionrepeatedly asks what life feels like through respiration, kinaesthesia,proprioception, skin, belly–mind, and Freud resorted to asking thepatient to lie down and not face the analyst to gain some freedomfrom the upright. Many of you have thought of the association ofhearing, listening, Sh’ma, hear, O Israel—listen. The Bible haspassages suggesting be quiet, lie still, and hear God.Higher and lower played an important role in spiritual direction,eliciting and heightening spiritual awareness. To people Nachmanperceived to be on a lower, simpler rung, he would say, “God iseverything everywhere.” He would make it easy to find and boostfaith. You cannot escape God. He is in everything you do. To thosewho were learned and secretly proud of their minds, he would say,“God is mysterious, unknown, ungraspable.” A never-ending ancientlesson, God is not defined or confined by representations.Nachman distinguishes between hidden and revealed faith. Hewas an observant Jew. He followed the Torah to the letter as best hecould. As a mystic, there was a sense that Torah laws are conduits toGod, paths of and to the One. On this level, there is a certain clarity,do’s and don’ts, customs, rituals. A rabbi once explained to me thatthe laws and customs communicate what God wants of you. You donot ask a lover, why do you want it this way, not that way. You wantto please the beloved; you do it. Yet, hidden dimensions beckon andattract Freud and Nachman, psychoanalysts and kabbalists. Oftenwhat is hidden is right before your eyes in plain view. In that case, theway one sees or fails to see is what makes something hidden or not.Like Nachman, Wertheimer (Eigen, 2005; “Guilt” in EmotionalStorm) says it is not a matter of reasons, but of life, experience. If youask someone the reason for his faith, he might be able to give you alot of good talk, but, at bottom, faith is its own reason. There is a pointwhere reasons are not the point. Faith is. There are kinships through-out the Bible, passages speaking about God’s faith, linking with Job’sfaith. Jesus: Father, why have you forsaken me? What kind of faithcalls to God from the depths of forsakenness? What kind of faith isthis when all has been taken away? What kind of faith when the Oneyou call is gone, when there is no one to call? A faith for which youCHAPTER TWO63"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"cannot give any reason. A bare heart’s centre, nothing left. Nachmanspeaks of faith at the core of a broken heart, broken-hearted faith.“There is nothing so whole as a broken heart.” One day he feelshimself a man of clarity, a man of revealed religion. The next he is barefaith itself, broken, destitute, gratuitous faith—the thing itself. Godgone, faith is the only link. God’s presence is all the more acute in itsabsence. At such times, Nachman finds communication impossible, atother times, he speaks beautifully. There is something you cannoteven tell yourself. You cannot tell yourself what it is, but it is. Wouldsomeone like Nachman be given medication today for states he feltwere hidden messages from God? Would his world of experience berespected? Would some be nourished and enriched by it? Are wetoday enriched by it? Would we be the poorer had he not transmittedsomething of it?[A seminar member asks a question relating faith to longing, faith aslonging, not clear on the tape.]Response:For Nachman, longing is part of a path. In certainmoments, certain spheres or “rungs” of faith, it is a stimulant. Youlong for more, you long for further contact.Seminar member: Or in the context of what you said before, longingfor what you have but don’t have . . .Response:Yes, exactly. Nachman said that everything has aheart, all of nature is alive with heart. The whole world has a heart, isheart. He depicts the world heart as an alive body, like the Sephirot,with head, hands, feet. His vision is great, magnanimous at suchmoments. He says that even the toenail of the world heart is moreheart than any other heart. This reminds me of those moments whenhe feels he is living a day such as never was lived before, thinking athought, praying a prayer such as never was thought or prayedbefore, from height to height, going beyond everything that ever was. Even the toenail of the heart of the world does this. This re-minds me of Marion Milner (1987) writing about consciousness of thebig toe.Green (2004) writes of a Nachman story about a mountain spring atone end of the world, heart at the other. The heart longs for the springand the spring longs for the heart. As one might expect, there are diffi-culties. The sun, eager for the heart and mountain spring to meet,64KABBALAH AND PSYCHOANALYSIS"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"shines so brightly that it burns the heart. This reminds me of how God,in creative exuberance, shattered some of the vesssels (sephirot) ofcreation. The sun, like God, eager to help, forgets its own strength.Such tales mirror our fragility in relation to our own energies.The sun burns the heart while the heart cries in longing for thespring. We are caught between too much and too little, too muchaliveness, too much deadness, burnt by our desire for more aliveness.Yet, the heart keeps going. When it must rest, a great bird spreads itswings over it, protecting it. This reminds me of Faust falling asleepwhen he discovers that Beatrice killed herself, the healing work ofdeep sleep. Or the fig tree God caused to grow to give shade to Jonah,hovering over all the complexities of a complicated heart.If the heart is filled with so great a desire for the spring, whydoesn’t it simply enter the spring? There are complications. One isthat the mountaintop keeps disappearing, or almost disappearing. Ina mystical way, the spring is the life of the heart. If the mountaintopwhere the spring flows should vanish, the heart would die. Back andforth: it cannot have the spring, it cannot be without the spring. Thespring flows through the heart but no one knows how. If the formerwas lost to heart vision, not only would the latter die, the whole worldwould be destroyed. Existence depends on a delicate link betweenspring and heart.This brings us to a fourth path. We have constant struggle, danc-ing and singing, and speaking from a broken heart. The fourth root offaith involves awareness that one has no understanding at all.Ignorance, not knowing as a path. It is paradoxical how deep one cango, and how fully one can open by going through the gate of notunderstanding. Nachman straddled worlds. One day he “knew”. Oneday he didn’t. Knowing is good, he said, but my I don’t know is better.Faith based on revealed truth is good, but deeper faith has no proofor reason. Nothing to hold on to but faith itself, “faithfulness in thenight”. Akin to Job’s faith, everything stripped away, or Jesus’ cryfrom forsakenness. Calling from the depths, the night.If I love God with all my heart and soul and might, with every-thing in me, in so far as this is possible, my hate loves God. If I loveGod with all I am, then my hate loves God, I love God with my hateas well. We know from Freud how affects, pronouns, and statesreverse. Reciprocity and reversal between hate and love, betweendoubt and faith. My doubt loves God. My unbelief loves God. MyCHAPTER TWO65"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"atheism loves God. Can I say my faith hates God? There are ways thatthis is so. We have this fluidity.Nachman speaks of the wholeness of faith. He affirms the ques-tioning mind, the technical and scientific mind, without which wewould not have a building to be in or a sound system to speakthrough. We would not have the books that form a basis of our studyin our meeting today. Yet, Nachman expresses a tension between themind that asks for reasons and a faith no “reason” can encompass. Alittle like Winnicott saying you ought not ask a child if he created ordiscovered the breast or prepossessing object of interest. The childshould not have to make such a decision when immersed in a signif-icant experience. If the child is immersed in illusion, it might, for amoment, be paradoxical, creative illusion, nourishing being.A variant of Nachman’s vision of wholeness involves wholeness ofthe universe, in which anything can become anything else. He speaksof the universe as a dreidel, a spinning top, in which life forms turninto each other. One might almost be reading passages from ChuangTzu (1964). A head may turn into a foot and vice versa. Angels andmen transform into each other. High becomes low, low high. Allmanner of separations and blends of spiritual and material qualitiesoccur. He stresses a common root. For a resonant depiction, see Bion’sdiagrams of a single root at the origin of various phenomena and cate-gories. (Cogitations, 1994b, p. 323; Appendix 4, O-grams.) In thisvision, Nachman and Bion overlap in depicting transformational pro-cesses emanating from a common source.Nachman’s vision of everything transforming into everything else,and Nachman’s and Bion’s sense of common origin (O) or root, is abasis for compassion. Bion writes of different ways of using or relat-ing to truth, depending on attitude, disposition, sense of life: cruel orcompassionate use of truth. Nachman spoke of love as a basis for lifebefore there was Torah. The biblical patriarchs lived through love,God’s love, before God gave Moses the Torah. Inherent love was theguide. One could argue Torah always existed, or that there is notemporal before–after when it comes to God. Torah is eternity, part ofeternity, infinite. But in our time-world, in the depiction of before–after, love came first.Similar questions can be raised with regard to God’s withdrawalto create the world. Everything is God, filled with God: how can therebe nothing, “space” void of God? Nachman leaves such questions66KABBALAH AND PSYCHOANALYSIS"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"unanswered. From his point of view, all will be clear in heaven. Butin terms of methodology on earth, he places importance on not know-ing. Not knowing becomes a spiritual and psychic path, shedding,deepening, quickening, opening.There might be other ways of experiencing, akin to Freud’sprimary process or Matte-Blanco’s symmetrical mode of being (Eigen,2011, “Distinction–union structure” in Contact With the Depths.)Adimension might exist in which God is and is not everything. If Godcan do anything, God can do that. Bion wrote that for a thing to be, itis and is not at the same time. Aspects of psychoanalysis tap experi-ential possibilities often overlooked, dimensions in which the law ofcontradiction does and does not hold. Openness to different experi-ential possibilities feed each other.I would like to read something from Chuang Tzu (1964) that ishard to pass up, about everything turning into everything else.Joy, anger, grief, delight, worry, regret, fickleness, inflexibility, mod-esty, willfulness, candor, indolence – music from empty holes, mush-rooms springing up in dampness, day and night replacing each otherbefore us, and no one knows where they sprout from. Let it be! Let itbe! It is enough that morning and evening we have them, and they arethe means by which we live. Without them we would not exist, with-out us they would have nothing to take hold of . . . I do not know whatmakes them the way they are. It would seem as though they have sometrue Master, and yet I find no trace of him. He can act – that is certain.Yet I cannot see his form. Whether I succeed in discovering his identityor not, it neither adds nor detracts from his Truth. (pp. 32–33)Here is another another passage:All at once Master Yu fell ill. Master Ssu went to ask how he was. “Amazing!” said Master Yu. “The Creator is making me allcrookedy like this! My back sticks up like a hunchback and my vital organs are on top of me. My chin is hidden in my navel, myshoulders are up above my head, and my pigtail points at the sky. Itmust be some dislocation of the yin and yang! . . . My, my! So the Creator is making me all crookedy like this! (pp. 80–81)Master Yu goes on reflecting that perhaps the hidden one will turn hisarm into a rooster to announce the day, or a bow to shoot prey forfood. Each transformation has uses. There are so many changes, it isbest to be free of being bound by them.CHAPTER TWO67"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"You might be astonished to find a radical reincarnation view inNachman and its fit with ancient imagery, as well as the theme of notknowing.

Along thisline, when Buddha was asked metaphysical questions, he might saysomething like, “Just keep meditating. Those are questions I cannotanswer. Keep practising.”Questioner: . . .

There are happier versions offaith, perhaps, than the faith I am touching, which often (not always)has a tragic element. There is an urge to talk people out of dark places,but for some, that is a greater horror than living in the dark. There areterrible truths vital for living. To lose them can be losing a chance tobe born. You tell a child, “It was only a dream, a nightmare”, imply-ing it is not really real, things will look different in daylight. But therecomes a time when nightmares are vital to one’s growth, expressionsof psychic realities, traumas, binds, difficulties. When I saw Bion andtold him some troubling dreams, he sided with the dream figures,saying, “Your dream is real. The feelings and images are real.” Emo-tionally real, real feeling.What I am trying to convey today, in part, is expressed by thecircle and ray diagram (Appendix 3): common nucleus, many radii. Asimple diagram, too simple, it signals common roots and manyoffshoots. Perhaps we have many nuclei and radii, cores and off-shoots. Even shared originating processes take different forms.

Something in us needs and wants to respect complexity. Butperhaps something cannot bear it.[Inaudible question.]Response:There can be faith–love, there can be faith–truth, therecan be bad faith, but the latter is not the faith we are talking about.

I was wondering if faith mightbe linked to wisdom related to a kind of loss or sacrifice; the willingrelease of memory, knowing and desire is a kind of death. Also thedarkness you speak of—a kind of death, a way of dying.Response:That is beautifully put. We have polarities, no? Plenitudeand emptiness, loss and fullness. All the parts of our beings are thecolour of our life. Kafka called life an incomplete moment. If life is anincomplete moment, certainly this one is also. This might not be truefor all people at every moment. I can verify what you are saying by adifferent example. To get along with someone, you have to tolerateloss or there will not be room for how the other sees you. You have tomake room for the other. If you only want the other to see you accord-ing to your desires, you want your desire to capture the other’s desire(or vice versa). You can have some good times that way, but sooner orlater it is going to hurt. Something is going to happen to break thatfusion, illusion, megalomania. If you cannot build up tolerance forloss, for example, loss of how the other sees you, loss of how you wantto see the other, loss involving unfulfilled desires and images, if youcannot tolerate loss, you cannot tolerate a relationship. On the otherhand, if you can tolerate such loss, there is much to gain.[Question about taking a rest from the law, although the tape is partlyinaudible.]Response:I think we need a lot of downtime from law. Law can betoo much for us. You have to take it with a grain of salt, a little flexi-bility. When I went through a pretty radical orthodox phase—strictlyobserving Shabbos(Sabbath), being kosher, whatever else I could do—my family suffered terribly. I hear from many orthodox people thatgetting through Shabboscan involve a lot of wear and tear. The idea ofrest can be idealised when you are dealing with wretched kids. I knewone dedicated man who got through Shabbosby sleeping much of theday. Reality is one thing, ideal another. Yet, there are many for whomstrict observance is beautiful or has beautiful aspects.Nachman was observant. For him, like many Jewish mystics, thelaws are ways to get closer to God, avenues of contact. We can followhim and go into the woods together and reach great heights. But, inreality, we come back to our affectional ties, daily existence, city life.Whether you are observant or not, whatever path you follow orCHAPTER TWO71"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"discover, we come to something mysterious. We participate in a senseof mystery. It is a root moment that connects our lives. Taoism says,“Stay with the situation as it is. If you impose right and wrong, trueand false, you will likely make a bigger mess”. Hard enough to staywith things as best you can without trying to treat them as you thinkthey ought to be.You talked about taking a rest from the law. I was thinking thatmaybe that is what God does on Shabboswhen He rests. Law can betoo much for God, too. As babies, as children, we spent a lot ofmoments without the Law. Immersed in play, in fascination, timeless.I think, too, of Nachman saying that we lived by love before the Law.The Law gives us Shabbos, which is beautiful, then makes Shabbosunhappy, so many details to watch out for. For some, all the obser-vances are second nature. Even so, there can be unwanted conse-quences. For a time we had Friday night dinners with an ecstaticrabbi, who fell asleep at the table. He could not keep his head up oreyes open out of fatigue. His Shabboschores and preparation were toomuch for his constitution. His wife looked at him apprehensively,knowingly, tending to the table and the children.A phrase, “We lived a long time without it”, comes back to me. Iheard Anna Freud say it at a meeting in London in 1975. André Greenspoke about changes in psychoanalysis, using Winnicott, Bion, Lacan,Freud. He outlined basic dynamics of borderline psychosis. As Ilistened, I felt psychoanalytic imagination was alive. Leo Rangellspoke about the structural theory as it was used in the USA. He spokea lot about superego. I felt deadened. The two talks seemed to repre-sent diverse spirits and interests. I heard of further complicationsbehind the scenes. Rangell was in the Los Angeles PsychoanalyticSociety. When Bion migrated to Los Angeles in the last decade of hislife, the Los Angeles Society denied this creative man (and formerpresident of the British Society) full status. Perhaps he did not fit theirpicture of psychoanalysis. Creativity and difference is often defendedagainst. Near the end of the meeting, Anna Freud, in old age, got upand said, “Structural theory, structural theory. We lived a long timewithout it.” An unexpected moment, a breath of air, an affirmation ofcreative spirit. A thirty-nine-year-old man at the meeting, me, felt sheresponded to the same enlivening and deadening spirits that I did.You might say Rangell’s use of the structural theory was a kind ofdeadening use of the law, while Green explored ins and outs of72KABBALAH AND PSYCHOANALYSIS"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"processes that opened doors of madness. So, yes, the law has its func-tions, but you have to watch out. Everything is dangerous. The law isdangerous. No law is dangerous.

And, like a baby, whocannot take too much consciousness, take time off as needed or ascircumstances allow.Question:Doesn’t rage grow out of desire?Response:It can, and desire can be more than sexual. Nachman gotoverly stuck on eradicating sexual desire but, if you want to put it thatway, there are scarier desires, like subjugation. Slavery was part ofhuman life for quite a long time and, one way or another, even if onlyinwardly, still is.Rage can be complicated. If it is linked with desire it can be a needto always be right. Or a need to feel omnipotent, or strong, or power-ful. Or an inability to face a sense of helplessness and work with it(“impotent rage”). Rage can be one of the most orgasmic, total states.It short-circuits complex psychic functioning. It blots out (a biblicalphrase) complex awareness. It might be a response to sensed injusticeand injury. Whether or not it has a positive function depends on manyfactors. In my book, Rage(2002), I comment that a sense of being righthas done more harm in human history than most other attitudes. Ragefeeds on a sense of being right.Question:Life is such a mixture and you have written about themixtures of feelings compellingly. You have included a sense of theholy. Can you say something about this now?Response:Here is a story I think I told you in our first seminar. Alot of new people are here today, so I will risk repeating it. Maybesomething a little different will happen this time around. When I wasa child, an old man would come to our house once or twice a year fora donation. His name was Rabbi Kellner. My father would stop what-ever he was doing and greet him and respond to his requests. WhenRabbi Kellner came, he brought a light with him, a glow. Mostlycentred around his face, his head. His forehead, cheeks, beard, eyes—a glow that varied in shades, bright white light to golden. When hetalked to me I lit up.CHAPTER TWO73"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"I felt something like it when my clarinet teacher played for me atthe end of lessons. The sounds tickled me and I could not stop laugh-ing. He would threaten to stop playing if I did not stop laughing, butI could not help myself.The glow I experienced with Rabbi Kellner I later came to recog-nise as a sense of the holy. I suspect the laughter I felt with my clar-inet teacher was a soul reflex to being tickled by beauty. The soul canbe tickled by beauty and glow with the holy. Through Rabbi Kellner,I experienced the holy as embodied and real.During the time I said Kaddish for my father, a rabbi referred me toRabbi Kastel in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and when Kastel heard mystory he suggested I study with two old men in Crown Heights—RabbiKellner’s sons! This was over fifty years after my childhood meetingswith their father! Here I was, a fifty-year-old man, studying with theaged sons of a rabbi who mediated a holy glow in my childhood.They told me many things. One that comes back to me nowbecause we were speaking about rage—when the Messiah comesthere will be peace on earth. If a man lifts his hand to strike anotheran angel will stop it. (I recently found online an article I wrote for TheJewish Reviewin 1987, soon after my father died, about experiencesthat brought me closer to the mysterious sense we hover with:http://thejewishreview.org/articles/?id=66.)As for the mixtures you mention: we have emotional capacitycapable of experiences that seem to go beyond what we call real. Butthey are very real and help shape our existence. In emotional realitythere can be maximum destructiveness and maximum love. How isthis possible? A sense of the Good, Beauty, Holy, Justice intertwined,opposed to, fused with destruction. That we recoil at this notion indi-cates that we are afraid to let in fully our experiential capacity. Weshut off experience to let in what we can manage. At the same time,we sense there is more that we simply are not up to. To reach a pointwhere we will not have to strike each other to defend our smalleremotional territories, we need to acknowledge the more we cannotaccess. To live in this More, in awareness of this More, to make a senseof the More a living part of us, an essential part, might help to takethe edge off our need to affirm and defend little portions of “self” atothers’—and our own—expense.Time is almost up and there is so much to say and do. We havetouched several of the threads that Kabbalah has in common with74KABBALAH AND PSYCHOANALYSIS"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"psychoanalysis, but far from the seventeen I counted before the semi-nar started. For the remaining moments, I would like to say a fewwords about Bion. I am looking at Cogitations(1994b, pp. 234–235).Among the threads we have waded into is the thread of not know-ing, unknowing, realisation, and confession that one does not know,faith without knowing (Eigen, 2011, Chapter Three, “I don’t know”).It appears in many ways in many places in Bion. One extraordinarypassage is on pp. 234–235.For Bion, what is the core of a dream? Emotional experience is thecore of a dream. Emotional experience, for good or ill, is not only thecore of a dream, but of the psyche. In the passage we are looking athe distinguishesbetween the experience that consists in trying to understand anemotional experience that is secondary to the attempt to solve a prob-lem, and the experience that consists in trying to solve a problem inwhich the emotional experience itself is the problem. (p. 234)For the former, we have the arsenal of induction, deduction, analyticand logical thinking, common sense, hypothesis, inference, variouscognitive operations involved in problem solving, including the “feel”of a situation, “hunches”, goal directed intuition, selected facts that jellgestalts, various mental syntheses. We seek solutions, synthesisingmaterial we gather together. This is an important use of mind, span-ning means–end relations, goals, purpose, learning how things workand how we see things, issues of creative construction and regulation.Bion writes, in the second instance in which emotional experienceitself is primary and problematic, “there is probably no way of regard-ing the problem as anything at all” (pp. 234–235). This is one of Bion’smost dramatic ways of pointing to radical unknowing when it comesto our most basic emotional life. It is a situation we try to extricateourselves from as soon as possible, seeking psychic organisations thatseem to offer meaning and coherence. That is, we have little tolerancefor the radically unknown nature of emotional life, finding ways outof this situation by turning it into something we imagine can beworked with by usual means (e.g., operations like those noted above).Bion continues, “In short, there are situations that are felt to beproblems that either have no solution, or to which no solution can befound with the equipment at the disposal of the individual experi-encing them” (p. 235).CHAPTER TWO75"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"I should let Bion’s statement sit as a psychoanalytic koan. Pleasecome back to it in its raw nakedness. It is a statement that undressesthe psyche and reveals it in its nudity. But I will spend a little timemeandering around it.The various mental operations I listed are among those that mightbe circumscribed by Bion’s notion, K, knowing, knowledge, thepursuit of knowledge. The domain he touches by directing attentionto the situation in which emotional experience is itself a primary prob-lem opens a “dimension” he calls F, faith. He describes faith as thepsychoanalytic attitude, a state of being without memory, expectation,understanding, or desire (a discipline or process or gesture towardssuch a “state”). He quotes a letter in which Keats wrote of a capacityto be “in uncertainties, Mysteries and doubts, without any irritablereaching after fact and reason”. In Attention and Interpretation(1970),he notes that F discipline can open a state of “hallucinosis”, a coun-terpart to psychotic hallucination, making it possible to link withpsychotic individuals from the inside, “psychosis to psychosis”.He is not saying K is bad and F is good. Capacities change valuesdepending on how they function in given contexts. Either, so to speak,can be good or bad, or good and bad. Bion supports exploring capa-cities and seeing where they lead, unending explorations with unend-ing mysteries (when it comes to F) and problems (when it comes toK). His method, partly, is a kind of psychic seeing and sensing,psychic vision and bracketing of vision, F-intuition. Freud spoke ofconsciousness as a kind of psychic sense organ. For Bion, F is a kindof psychic organ or attitude or path that opens walls to infinity.K is more akin to Buber’s I–It relation, akin to engineering, regu-lation, means–end relations, manipulation of experience. F is non-manipulative, seeking contact with the thing itself, akin to Buber’sI–Thou (1970). Part of growth towards F involves struggle to be lessmanipulative, more open to experience. Even with little success, suchstruggle can be beneficial. There is no one universal prescription forgrowth in the F-dimension, F-growth.When emotion itself is the problem, how do you tolerate emotion?Freud wrote about how frustrating tolerating the build up of statescan be. Dewey (2005) in Art As Experience,wrote beautiful passagesabout difficulties in tolerating the build-up of intensity in experienc-ing a work of art. He offered hints in training oneself to enable expe-riencing to build. We tend to short-circuit experience.

A little like getting used toseeing in the dark. One might begin to see or imagine or sense relatednetworks, veins, branches, links with other quasi-mute perturbations.One could pursue these in K modes of relating, often with profit. Butwe come back to F again, F in O, T in O, facing unknown reality, intan-gible, ineffable infinities and transformational events.Freud and Klein, in various ways, point out difficulties in stayingwith emotional life. We cannot stay with feelings for long. We shunt,displace, symbolise, evacuate, substitute, reverse, turn emotionalsensations or inklings or premonitions into something else. It is veryhard to stay with experiencing as such. To see a feeling through, to liveit through, especially if it is nameless, shapeless, homeless, is a taskawaiting development. To pay attention to this difficulty might stimu-late development. One can begin to appreciate in a new light Nach-man’s sense that emotions are God’s messengers, expressive vehiclesof unknown processes. Bion highlights difficulties of staying withunknown feelings in unknown ways, yet affirms the importance oftrying to do so. In F, there is nothing to hold on to, yet one may senseintimations of an unknowing “sensing” process, a “faithing” process.Bion emphasises the need to build capacity to stay with experi-ence, in so far as that is humanly possible. The capacity to work withemotion as a problem is embryonic, perhaps scarcely conceived. Togrow the capacity to work with, support, tolerate, digest emotionallife is an evolutionary challenge. Bion calls attention to this problem,notes it. We are not going to do justice to it. We are not going to drawup a plan of attack. At this point, we would not know what we weretrying to approach. Bion cultivates awareness that how to approachemotional experience isa problem. We wait on a capacity that has notyet arrived, or is gestating, perhaps in process of slowly being born.Levinas (1999) speaks of a new attitude, “maturity for insolubleproblems”, requiring waiting on emotional or attitudinal difficultiesfor which no solution is apparent. Need for growth connected withaffective attitudes exerts pressure that lacks words, thought, defini-tion, a state that in some way “may resemble sleep”. Levinas callsCHAPTER TWO77"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"upon a passage from St Exupery in which the little prince asks thepilot to draw a sheep.

It isstill sleeping in the bottom of the box; but a box over which personswho have drawn close to each other keep watch.

I have the idea ofa possibility in which the impossible may be sleeping. (1999, p. 89)To wait on a capacity not yet born or conceived, or one that is ges-tating, or slowly being born. Bion writes of ways we prematurely extri-cate ourselves from this situation. Sometimes, I think of what it wouldbe like if the whole world, every single person, top to bottom, chantedin synchrony three words little used in high places: “I don’t know”. Aworld-wide wave of unknowing together. It takes so much effort to pre-tend to know and to act as if one were better than one is, more wholeand knowing, and the cost to individuals and nations is high.An emotional problem without a “solution” or equipment to workwith it exerts pressure on personality. We can try to escape the pres-sure or try to stay with it, to the extent we can. In either case, pressurebuilds. If we stay with the problem without solution and the equip-ment to meet it does not arrive, the problem makes demands on us,on our ability and capacities. It makes demands on personality andthought. One thing that can happen when you stay with an emotionalexperience with no solution—Nachman’s “constant struggle” in anintermittent way—you keep coming back to it: itmay not get “solved”but youchange, yougrow in the process. The problem might or mightnot give way, but something happens to you. Batting your psycheagainst an unsolvable problem forces you to develop. In my chapter,“I killed Socrates” in Flames From the Unconscious (2009), I wrote of apsychic “wormhole”. The intensity of pouring oneself into an insolu-ble problem perforates the psyche and you find yourself in anotherplace, a place you might not have imagined before it happened. Theunsolvable can promote growth of experience in unsuspected ways.Well, I guess we will have to leave it at that for now, our time has runout. The seminar as an incomplete moment, a sense of beginning.78KABBALAH AND PSYCHOANALYSIS"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"APPENDIX 1Ein Sofand the Sephirot(Tree of Life)Ein Sofis a notation for the unnameable, inconceivable, unimag-inable, unrepresentable—what in English we call “God”. Thewords mean without boundaries, boundless, no bounds, repre-sented as infinity or infinite infinite. In a way, it is beyond God, as thelatter is a notation with a wide range of associations and meanings thatlimit its unknowability (the use of “it” is already a misappropriation).I personally sometimes think of Sofia, wisdom, already a vast limita-tion. With the popularity of Buddhism, one might speak of Ein Sofasno-thing and its twin emanation, being.Technically, Ein Sofis not part of the Sephirot/Tree of Life. It isbeyond all representation. You might envision it as the Energy thatflows through the Sephirotand “creates” them. UnrepresentablePrimal Power, or Presence. Again, these are terms drawn from ourphenomenology of force, action, experience, care, and mystery. Ishould say at the outset that everything I say is hypothetical, fantasy,attempts to express the inexpressible, touch the intangible thattouches me. Bion speaks of O, unknown, unknowable ultimate reality,not identical with Ein Sof, but not unrelated.There are ten Sephirotand an additional hidden one (Daat).

As the dramaunfolds, death is part of the stream.From Keterthe flow passes through Chochmah/wisdom, oftendepicted as a divine flash akin to “insight”—a sudden blast of whitelight containing all colours. Mozart described such relative momentswhen a symphony appeared to him in an instant, and all he had to dowas work it out. Saint Paul describes something like this when, in aflash, he was thrown by divine impact and all at once knew Christ. It remained for him to elaborate and develop his revelation and80APPENDIX 1Figure 1.Ein Sofand the Sephirot(Tree of Life)."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"relationship to divinity and the Divine Presence. I call these happen-ings “relative” because they appear to be relative levels of what ismeant by Chochmah, immediate, wordless, imageless impact andresponse. The narrative, or musical or visual forms that emerge toexpress felt impact, the instant “blast”, is relative to one’s moment inhistory, the way one uses language, the nature of one’s understand-ing. The “thing itself” eludes all “formulations” that sensed realitygives rise to. My use of “instantaneous impact” is also qualified. Inactual living, Chochmah, wisdom, might grow slowly over a lifetime, acumulative fruition through many experiences. In this case, ratherthan hitting all at once or in spurts, it sneaks up on one over time. Forsimplification of communication here, I will use my wording ofimpact and response.We are impelled, called upon to work with wordless, imagelessimpacts, mine them as best we can. From Chochmahthe flow passesthrough Binah/understanding. The divine impact works on us and wehave to work to understand. We think of God’s understanding as true,ours as relative, subject to error, bias, limitations, yet necessary. Wecannot evade the task of understanding, for, whatever we do, howeverwe live, we understand things one or another way. Our understand-ing, our “take” on life, impacts on how we live or fail to. This is onereason Socrates spoke for the importance of examining understanding:we often think we know things that we do not, sometimes with injuri-ous consequences. What we understand and the way or how weunderstand affects the quality of our existence.From Binah/understanding, the divine flow goes through Daat/knowledge, the hidden sphere on the tree. It is said to be directly con-nected to Ein Sofas well as a way station in the circuits of capacities. Inits direct connection, it is Godly knowledge, knowing God. As a con-ductor or sphere in the divine flow, it forms a kind of triangle: Choch-mah, Binah, Daat: Wisdom, Understanding, Knowledge. With Keter, aquaternity, or inverted triangle. The light of wisdom transmits throughunderstanding, which transmits through knowledge, all transmittingDivine Life–Intention (Keter) flowing from Ein Sof. We might write thiswith double arrows: Ein Sof, no-thing, infinite of infinites ↔fullness ofbeing, indicating reciprocal links between capacities. Some mysticsemphasise the downward flow (Chabad) and some the flow frombelow upwards (Nachman), but these are points of emphasis, for theflow cannot be circumscribed by directions (God exceeds directions).APPENDIX 181"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"The Sephirothave multiple references and act as kind of mirrorimages between Godly capacities and human capacities. The Sephirotfunction both as God’s medium for creation and as human capacitiesto realise divine life. Our capacities can be used for many purposes.Human wisdom, understanding, knowledge can make atom bombs,medicine, beautiful buildings, wondrous art, enlightenment journeys.There seems no end to what we can do with our capacities, good and ill. At the same time, the work of capacities can open us to theUnknown more deeply, fully, growing contact with the Deepest ofAll. Some express this by trying to lead a godly life in a human way.But one cannot trap or exhaust Ein Sofwith mind or story or intention.Yet, a point of contact keeps speaking to us, through us. Touched bythe Untouchable.Through Daat, the divine flow passes from Keter–Chochmah–Binah(wisdom–understanding–knowledge) to Chesed/mercy, lovingcompassion, the right hand of God. Then from Chesed/mercy toGevurah, judgement, the left hand of God. In human terms, the dialec-tical mixture of both love and judgement are needed. The dangers ofone without the other is harshness and severity on the one hand,mush on the other. Each contributes to the balance and growth of thewhole. I think of Jesus telling his disciples, “Be harmless as doves,prudent as serpents.” A wedding of care and discernment. TheHebrews in the Bible often were called stiff-necked, stubborn. Theywould not have survived otherwise. Neither would they have sur-vived without a most profound love and knowledge of God in theirhearts and souls, however great their stubborn resistance to thecommandments.From Gevurahthe flow passes through Tiferet/beauty, completingthe second triangle. If the first triangle (or double triangle) emphasisesthe head, the second touches the heart. Tiferet/beauty stands in themiddle of the tree, two channels above it, two below on the centraltrunk. The association of heart and beauty is profound. We are deeplytouched by the beauty in life, its association with time, loss, poignantlonging, the ache of being. The beauty of music animates Tiferet’ssoul.I think, too, of Keats: “A thing of beauty is a joy forever”. I feel that beauty is one root of ethics, a sense of wanting to do right by life,to do justice to that which can so arouse such depth of feeling (Eigen,2006, Chapter 1; 2012). On another level, it might not take much for thwarted desire associated with beauty to become destructive.82APPENDIX 1"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Capacities work in many ways. If the top Sephirotare associated withthe head, the second set is associated with the trunk, chest, heart andarms. The sephirottake shape along a model of the human body in itsupright aspect.Sephirotmeans spheres, partly referring to spheres of creation,dimensions, states, capacities. They are aspects of creative processes.They also, mystically, refer to the wheels of Ezekiel’s angels, one of theearly points of meditation of Kabbalah mystics (the wheels go roundand round in all directions, signifiers of spiritual aspiration and possi-bility). In Kabbalah, flow begins above and goes down, from higher tolower levels, but is not so limited. There is a saying, “As above, sobelow; as below, so above”. The flow goes both ways, all ways. Milner(1957) writes of flow from consciousness downward and simultane-ously from below, all reaches of the body, upward. Kabbalah speaksof worlds within worlds, world after world. Wherever one looks,there are worlds of experience and, beyond them, unknown worlds.The way we now picture the heavens, the universe and all its galax-ies, systems, and beyond, has similarities to the way Kabbalistspictured aspects of spiritual life.I feel the verticality of the Kabbalistic tree is a limitation. The verti-cal provides an important model of experience with deep roots, but isalso confining. It is associated with our upright posture, head top, feetbottom, above–below, higher–lower. This links with the verticaldimension of perception: sky or heaven above, earth below, upperand lower strata of society, higher and lower mental and social func-tions. But there are other possibilities. Deleuze and Guaterri (1987)contrast a rhizome with the vertical tree model. They feel the treemodel leads one to think of cause, or origins and effects, or endings,roots below, trunk upright, branch after branch. A rhizome can goevery which way, tangles of possibilities, no apparent centre or plan.They emphasise finding oneself in the middle, between, not confinedto a linear scheme, no obvious beginning or end.In The Psychotic Core(1986, Chapter 6), I discuss limitations to thevertical emphasis and propose other possibilities of flow. I think nowof Leonardo’s interest in tangles of hair and trickles of water.Psychoanalysis relied heavily on digestive and reproductive models,both with references to top–bottom (e.g., oral, anal, phallic, genital).These functions and images are not simply confined to top–bottom,but also refer to in–out.APPENDIX 183"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Asian spirituality emphasised respiration, chest, solar plexus, hara.The in–out flow of breathing is part of experience that permeates thebody. Kundalini/chakrasare partly organised via top–bottom andbottom-up images, emphasising the rise of the Kundaliniserpent(psychospiritual energy) from below up the spine, while seated in thelotus position. Body experience exceeds schemas of it. Unpredictable,intangible flows of body sensation, proprioception, kinaesthesia,inklings, intuitive promptings offer possibilities that maps miss.Freud hinted at this when he referred to semi-chaotic, early sensationspreads, which, in his scheme, became more unified with ego devel-opment. Still, delicious, if also feared and dumbfounding, sensorypossibilities play in the margins of awareness.Different models reflect different aspects of experience, or waysexperience can be organised. A fruitful model pays homage to expe-rience, mines the latter, and opens possibilities. Since experience is socomplex and multifarious, different kinds of models, even if theyappear to conflict with one another, add to what we can access.While vertical, the chains of triangles of the Kabbalah tree of lifeare not necessarily rigid. All sephirotcommunicate with each other,instant interweavings throughout the tree and beyond. There is a chil-dren’s song: Hashem is here, hashem is there, Hashem is truly every-where; up–down, all around, that’s where He can be found. Hashemliterally means the Name (the holy, unutterable, perhaps unknowableand unimaginable name of God). From this vertex, directionalityevaporates.The next triangle, the lowest obvious one (I say obvious, becauseother triangles, and triangles within and outside triangles, can bepostulated that are less immediately obvious) is Netzach–Hod–Yesod. Here, I used the names Splendour, Majesty, Foundation. I have seen schemes where Splendour is with Hod and Majesty with Netzach. Or perhaps they are called something else: for example,Netzach as endurance and determination. There can be a certainamount of shift, interweaving, and reversal. Why, I often wondered,were the lower sephirotcalled majesty and splendour? What does this tell us? If the middle set (Chesed, Gevurah, Tiferet) is the chest/trunk, the lower set involves pelvis and genitals and, in part, legs. Ina loose sense, this triangle is the Freudian sephirot. It makes sense tosee reverberations between the edifice Freud constructs from eroticexperience and the Kabbalah calling the genital function foundation.84APPENDIX 1"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"On the one hand, we are speaking loosely, but there is deep fit andresonance.In its positive aspect, erotic experience is splendour, majesty. Thereare people who see God during sexual intercourse, some feel like Godor a god. It is no accident that so much sexuality is associated with somany gods, East and West. Eros is, or can be, ecstatic. This on a purelevel of sensation, or sensation–feeling. Such majesty, such splendourbeyond words.Sensation has received a bad rap in western thought for manyyears. For Aristotle, God is active reason, active intellect. Sensory lifewas looked on as lower, disorganised, needing higher functions forformation. Recently, there is more writing on the spontaneous self-organisation of sensory life, without recourse to functions like reasonor judgement. And what of the beauty of sensation, all that it gives incolour and tone and inspiration, seeing the wondrous sky, mountains,music that brings uplifting tears, the touch of skin that brings us toheaven. So much sensation is ineffable. Poetry completes it (Lust, 2006,pp. 30, 34). The Song of Songs touches, expresses the erotic–divine.There is even such a thing as a God-sensation, a God-feeling. Vastdomains and subtle nuances where sensation–feeling blend. Freudsaying that consciousness is a sense organ for the perception ofpsychical qualities is a meditative fount.Another set of functions and experiences, associated with the“lowest” triangle, emphasises instrumentality, goal-orientated action,drive, plans, seeking and getting and building. This is one reasonNetzach is often associated with endurance or determination. Wemake plans, want something, desire to achieve, make things, accom-plish goals (or, as we often say now, live our passions, our dreams).This takes patience, skill, know-how, purpose, learning what leads towhat, luck, cause–effect, knowledge of how things work in reality,social–physical space–time. We need Netzach’s endurance, stubbor-ness, persistence and its complement: Hod is often associated withflexibility, more than one way to skin a cat. We take detours, compen-sate for loss, meet blocks, walls, make substitutions. If Netzach isassociated with persistence, Hod connects with plasticity.Persistence–plasticity: a twinship that has helped us to endure andcreate.Nezach–Hod–Yesod: persistence–plasticity and fecundity in actionare capacities that not only aid survival, but also can take one towardsAPPENDIX 185"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"God, unite with God, realise godliness on earth.

You might say, on a godly plane, all capa-cities are pure and give rise to divine realisation. But there is, also,smaller use of capacities, selfish, meaner, or narrow-minded use. TheGreat Spirit, the Great Dream, the Great Plan is, to various degrees,occluded, forgotten, unseen, unheard, unfelt, lost. One is left with asmaller ego at the centre of one’s universe, what I want and how toget it, often unsure of what that is. What is I? What is want? Yet, oneplunges in, uses whatever resources one has to accomplish what onethinks, feels, imagines are one’s goals. Nevertheless, on the plane ofhuman ambition and desire, much good can be done, much achievedof value and worth. Not just know-how, means–end relations, tech-nology, skill, but many kinds of creative activity. It feels good tocreate, to be creative, to make, to build. Yesod/foundation, a drivingforce at this level, procreation, fertility, genital life signifies generativ-ity in many ways. Yesodand all that flows from it partakes in aGenerative Spirit. In the human mirror, all capacities are doubleedged, multi-edged.Bion (1994b, p. 206) has a way of linking mathematics and geometrywith emotions, often emphasising sexual aspects. In one passage, heconnects the structure of a triangle with genitals. Not just three (trian-gular genital areas, or mother, father, baby), but also space, likened toholes or empty space in Henry Moore’s sculptures, at once a conjunc-tion of Eros and spirit in emptiness, an encompassing and encompassedemptiness. He speaks of Euclid’s “three-kneed thing” and his PonsAsinorum: “the ‘elements’ of geometry are left behind when the stu-dent crosses the Pons”. In seamless leaps, he links Euclid, Moore, andMelanie Klein’s positions (creative oscillation of breaking apart andcoming together): mathematics, art and psychoanalysis enmeshed witherotic, emotional, and spiritual life.William Blake captures the positive side of Yesodin his vision ofLucifer, the morning star, as illuminated. Satan is associated withEnergy. Here are some sayings from Blake’s “The marriage of heavenand hell”.Man has no Body distinct from his Soul for that call’d Body is aportion of Soul discerned by the five Senses, the chief inlets of Soul inthis age.86APPENDIX 1"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Energy is Eternal Delight.If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear toman as it is, infinite.Freud’s libido is sometimes described as erotic energy that flows,likened to electricity and water, taking many forms.

For both, imagination, even hallucina-tion, plays an important role in configuring desire. The flow of divineenergy through the sephirotis often depicted as a lightning flash inwhich human energy partakes.Some corrections and amplificationsMy presentation of Ein Sofand the sephirotmeans to loosely convey asense of possibilities, interactions, flows. I have not tried to stick to a rigid scheme (there is no one scheme to stick to; Kabbalah is filledwith variations). But I do wish to make some additions and qualifica-tions. While I have tended to emphasise sensation for Netzach–Hod–Yesod, one might better speak of sensation–feeling blends. Ihoped to bring out a little of what worlds of sensation offer in theirown right. Yet, in a way, sensation is a kind of feeling, a felt sensation.And feeling is a kind of sensation, a feeling sensation. The two arevirtually inextricable. SephirotNos 4–9 (Chesedthrough Yesod) areoften viewed as the emotional sephirot. SephirotNos 1–3, plus Daat, arethe “intellectual” sephirot. The last, No. 10, Malkhut, the realm ofaction. I find a loose blend of sensation–feeling–action useful in work-ing with Netzachthrough Yesod, a kind of instrumental attitude ormode of being, rather than interest in the thing itself. However, eventhis division does not do experience in these dimensions justice. Forexample, wondrous sexual moments are values for their own sake, thething itself. And this can be true of many sensory moments and times of creative immersion, for example, the rapture of scientificdiscovery.Loosely speaking, one might view the Kabbalah tree in terms ofJung’s four functions: the highest sephirot, direct, immediate know-ledge, intuition followed (still in the upper sephirot) by thinking; the middle sephirot, feeling; the lower triangle, sensation. Intuition,APPENDIX 187"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"thinking, feeling, sensation. The tree adds one more, the lowest,action, which might be symbolised by standing on our own two feet(as happens during Jewish prayer).One could also make correlations between the lower sephirotandHusserl’s empirical ego, the middle sephirotwith Husserl’s psycho-logical ego, and the upper sephirotwith Husserl’s transcendental ego.It is said that only the first three sephirotplus Daatare intact, therest are broken. They shattered during the act of creation, unable totake the flow of Divine Energy. The first three plus Daatare directemanations (intuitive conception) from and pathways to God, stillwhole. In my vision, breakage is progressive, the sensation group(Netzach–Hod–Yesod) more broken than the emotion group (Chesed,Gevurhah, Tiferet), with Malkhut, No. 10, most broken of all.Nevertheless, it is on the plane of Malkhutthat our daily humanlives take place—life on planet earth, called Kingdom. The Kingdomof real life by real human beings made up of all the enumerated capacities and more. The most broken of all—our kingdom. In theCatholic prayer: thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth, as it isin heaven. Here broken, there whole. Malkhut, the most broken sphere of all—our home, said to be the end, the point, the purpose of God’screation: the human drama in all its facets. All the higher and highestmade for the lowest. What can we do with it? What dare we do with it?Like the Holy Spirit in Catholic mystical experience, we are giventhe torn and tattered Shekinah, a feminine aspect of God, with us tohelp in the work of healing and creative action. She dwells with us inMalkhut, giving of her inspirited Presence. In our sphere, torn andtattered, yet beautiful, Queen of Sabbath, with us in travails in thedeepest Sabbath point of the soul.“Holy, holy, holy. The whole earth is filled with Your glory.” Avision with which Blake could well concur, which his life and workexpress.Broken lives, broken souls. There is a saying, “The whole world ismade just for you”, our mission, to tend, to mend, to lift ourselves, togive of ourselves. Rabbi Nachman: “Nothing is more whole than abroken heart.”The kind of lifting called for defies the Tree, has no location,dissolves limitations by using them.88APPENDIX 1"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Two tales of brokenness: Cain and the Tower of BabelWhen Cain killed Abel, he repented.

To be an actual murderer has at least one virtue orlearning. One knows one is a killer. One learns that one can murder.Many deny this possibility. Many think they are not murderers. Thismight make them more dangerous than Cain. To think one is free ofbeing a murderer is a serious deception.I think of all the mini-murders one commits daily to oneself andothers. And how can one escape murder if one has a baby or is a baby?Mutual murder is part of growing up.But Cain overstepped a line.

He set it up, play-ing favourites, inciting rivalry. A jealous God, possessive, destructive,God of love and justice. As mixed up as earth.The Tower of Babel story has a similar mix.

As Bion (1994b, p. 241) relates thetale, the people of earth get together to build a tower to reach heaven. Not a horrendous effort—who does not want to reach heaven?

The people now are scattered, dispersed,their attempts at unity broken, with the consequence (punishment) ofno longer understanding each other’s language. One language hasbecome many, understanding broken. Perhaps this latter state is areference to something deep in the human condition, our lack ofability to understand each other or even to understand ourselves. Ithighlights difficulties of connection, including connecting withoneself.The drama moves from unity to dispersal, a basic conjunction.Unity ↔dispersal. The destructive force is depicted as coming fromwithout (God), as often happens in natural catastrophes or in obvioushuman violations of one another. But I think it safe to posit a destruc-tive force coming from within the group, within humanity, withinourselves, you and me. We are still far from owning this fact of ournature and far from knowing what to do with it. There is somethingin us that takes us out of Eden, something in us that destroys heav-enly aspirations. This is part of the challenge of Malkhut. We like toemphasise a hopeful, creative element, but doing so, true as it is, oftendiminishes perception of what we are up against. Perhaps it is notheaven we have to worry about, but how to get along on earth.Perhaps the story is warning us against over-idealising a good state,in so far as that prevents us from working with complexities of ourreality.Some meditative notesMeditative possibilities with the sephirotare limitless. Many systemshave been worked out. For example, sephiroteach have numbers,colours, sounds, names of God associated with them. The possibilitiesare limited only by scholarship and imagination and perhaps a certainspiritual “feel”.Kierkegaard’s hierarchical depiction of the man of action, aesthet-ics, and ethics has some relevance. But what we call “goodness”, or90APPENDIX 1"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"“the Good”, runs seamlessly through the whole tree as an expressionof God’s nature. In pure Buddha mind, all capacities depicted arepure. Perhaps especially Keter, Chochma, Binah, Daat, and Chesed. Here,it is easy to imagine purity of will, wisdom, intuition, and reflection.But we say in God all of these capacities are pure, from earthly gener-ative acts (Malkhut) to intuitive union (Keter). At the same time, theseare human capacities, narratives, representations of godly workthrough our own disposition and ability. They are projections, alsodepicted as mirrors of godly tendencies. Whether God or demon isoften a matter of context and use. It appears to be human to think ofgods and demons. Psychoanalysis is one area engaged in the struggleto expand what we think of as human. To be simply human iscomplex indeed.One can meditate on any of the sephirot. We can go endlessly deepinto any capacity. Pick your sephiraor let it pick you, quietly attendand you become partner to worlds within worlds, worlds withoutend. You will envision how any capacity can be evil and/or good inways that cannot be untangled. You may wish to be good, but if youthink you succeed in transcending evil, you are in danger of being ademon.The whole tree lights up, quivers, trembles. It lights up as wholeand in all of its parts. Crystals, rays, indescribable radiance. A greatwork of the Kabbalah is called Zohar, variously translated as radiance,splendour. Any sephiratakes you beyond itself to the others.

The Bible says the soul is pure and Jewish mysticismsays a pure point of soul is in contact with God.There is dispute as to whether Atzilut, emanation, is characteristicmainly of Keter(crown) or extends to the rest of the “head”, Chochmah,Binah, Daat(wisdom, understanding, knowledge). Does the secondworld, Beriah(creation), begin with Chochma(wisdom), or with Chesed(mercy)? For our purpose, I will treat Atzilut, emanation, as includingthe head sephirotplus Daat, which, strictly speaking, has no location(direct Godly knowledge).We will posit the second world, Beriah, creation, starting withChesed(mercy) and going through Tiferet(beauty).

Here, things take newkinds of forms, not just Godly emanation, but human formation.Nevertheless, each of the limiting conditions in the world of formationstems from spiritual attributes. In this scheme, it is difficult to get to atotally godless place, although such a possibility is postulated for thelowest reaches of Malkhut. Formative capacities can be exploited bythese lowest reaches, but, in our real lives, they are mixed up witheverything else.The fourth world, Assiah, action, involves Malkhut. Malkhut, like allsephirot, has many levels, regions, dimensons, and possibilities. It isthought possible—some say experience confirms this—that thereexists so low a level that even God cannot penetrate it, a godless place,a godless moment. It is said that in Egypt, the Hebrews reached theforty-ninth level of depravity, had they gone down one more, theywould have been unredeemable. This last might seem unimaginable,but many people feel it. There are states of depression and also of evilin which help seems impossible, all is hell. Was it Ortega who saidabout hell, “Mother church says hell exists, so it must be so. But I don’tthink Father God ever sends anyone there.” I was taught by Jewishmystics that after death the soul goes to something comparable to thecleaners, getting fit for heaven.Still, one cannot completely escape a sensation that there issuch athing as total evil, a realm beyond God and redemption. Yet anothersensation says, “I don’t believe it”.Freud writes of some energy vanishing in the work of the deathdrive. He postulates a constant quantity of energy in the psychic94APPENDIX 2"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"universe, yet some of it disappears in psychic death work, perhaps anentropy tendency. William Blake writes, “All states are eternal”.Perhaps we can encompass this, for the moment, by using doublearrows to express alternating or reversible states: God ↔no god. God↔godless.I do not mean to paint (pain) a gloomy picture of Malkhut. But Ifeel if we fail to learn more about what to do with our destructiveaspects, we will fail to learn what to do with life. Malkhut, the worldof our activities on planet earth, offers abundance in so many ways,yet death is part of it, and death’s mimic, destructive action. In theMiddle Ages, the devil was called a clown. In Freud’s letters to Jung,Freud called the ego a clown. We had better watch out for what wethink, say, and do. When psychoanalysts said a goal was to turn idinto ego, a danger sign should have lit up. I would not want my totallife, the sum of existence, to be in the hands of my smaller ego and itsgrasping, destructive proclivities. When Freud wrote the words trans-lated as “beyond the pleasure principle” (1920g), perhaps he oughtalso to have added, “beyond the lower, lowest ego”. What is it in usthat can take into account all our proclivities? Is that possible? How?A transcendent function?I recently saw the film, A Dangerous Method, which I found, inmany respects, “funny”, psychoanalytic fun. For example, the para-dox: Jung kept saying he had to go beyond the Freudian emphasis onsexual motivation, yet he was the one who slept with patients. Can theego with all its desires and ambitions be the guardian against self-deception? Who is fooling whom?The four worlds might, also, be viewed in terms of Jung’s fourfunctions: intuition, thinking, feeling, and sensation. I think of theancient schema, earth, fire, water, and air, or the four humours,choleric, melancholic, sanguine, and phlegmatic. Four is an attractivenumber; Jung called it a symbol of unity. Unities keep cracking. Isuspect what human beings keep trying to get at is a way to talk aboutinterplay of states and capacities. To this moment, we have notstopped trying.APPENDIX 295"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"APPENDIX 3Circle and rays97Figure 1.Circle and rays 1."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Idrew these diagrams as simple depictions of the idea of manypaths through, or somehow associated with, a common centre.One can picture them as radiating out of a common centre orcrossing through the latter, emanating from a nucleus, or whateveryour imaginations suggest.

He quotes a book that writes of Chinese charactersas poetry (1994b, p. 323). He likes the idea of opposites com-bined in a single image, diverse directionality in a figure. It connotesrichness of experience. The ideogram-like hierarchies that he sketchedI have called O-grams. Each begins or ends with O alone beneath allprocesses and branches above it.In Chapter One (pp. 23–24), I wrote about some of the relationshipsbetween Bion’s O-grams and the Kabbalah and the structure of thesephirot. In O-gram no. 1, O subtends “root”, which branches off toinstrument, God, stone, language, paint. From a primordial O-sense,tools, spirit, expressive materials (language, paint, stone) emerge, andfrom these, music, religion, sculpture, poetry, and painting. Bionquotes from Ernest Fenollosa’s work on Chinese characters, “Mysubject is poetry . . .” He gravitates towards expressive gestures,expressive needs, contact with life, and the press to mine what thiscontact gives rise to. In the beginning, there is O. And O gives rise toexperience pressing for survival and culture, a kind of complexmonism. By saying, “in the beginning”, I have already misappropri-ated O, which might not have beginning or end.Note that Bion does not include business or economics or moneyor the drive for power in this grouping, important as they may be. Heincludes areas connected with cultivation of emotional life for its ownsake, not mainly for instrumental reasons. There may be areas wherethe two are one, or are connected or stimulate each other, or occludeeach other. But in this O-gram there is primacy of emotional expres-siveness and the art and religion it engenders.In Werner Herzog’s film, Cave of Forgotten Dreams, a documentaryabout cave drawings in France over 30,000 years ago, one of the scien-tists interviewed said something like: “Man should not be calledHomo Sapiens but Homo Spiritus.” The images on the cave werebreathtaking, inspiriting and, after all “rational” explanations areexhausted, mysterious. Inspired by spirit, the spirit of inspiration,inspired by O-impacts that compel expressive search and dedication.We might be killers, but we also are lovers, awe-stricken, touchedby wonder and a need to create and express what touches us and theworlds it opens: O-visions.Meditate on any part of the O-grams and more opens.

Moments of intensity, appreci-ation, awakening. In the last sentence on page 323, Bion (1994b)writes, “What is important? The root? The flower? The germ? Theconflict? The durability?”Enter any place, tend it, and gardens, forests, worlds grow. Verylike the sephirotbut the structural analogue to Ein Sof, O, is at thebottom, not the top. This is very like the experience I had with Bionwhen I met him. The instant I walked in for my session, I felt he wasunder me. It is hard to put this into words. I think of the word “under-stand”, to stand under. I felt him not above but under, a mute supportin my painful search. It brought near instant relief, a sense that yes,here was something I could value, a bridge that made my life morepossible.Bion by no means minimises the importance of succession ortemporal ordering. In an ideogram, bite/dog/man, it makes a differ-ence whether man bites dog or dog bites man. Nevertheless, a dimen-sion of compression (akin to Freud’s “opposite meanings of primalwords”) plays an important role in experience and psychic ambience.The latter overlaps with domains called “primary process”, “syncreticexperiencing”, “implicate order”, “symmetrical mode of being”.In O-gram no. 2, Bion suggests processes spanning a number ofdimensions. In the middle of the list are alpha elements, loosely sepa-rating things in themselves (beta elements through O) and images.Alpha elements turn things in themselves to images. I put this crudelyand wrongly. They no more turn one into the other than one puts feel-ings into words. Did you ever see someone put a feeling into words?Invisible rabbits into a hat? These are ways of speaking, occluding andalluding to transformational processes incessantly at work. Theyimply something more graspable and solid than exists. Neverthe-less, Bion implies some division between what is above and belowalpha.Again, rudely put, he calls alpha a meaningless term meant to noteunknown processes that transform a sense of things-in-themselvesinto various forms of meaning. We say transforms, but this does notmean the domain of things-in-themselves ceases, disappears intomeaning. Perhaps it is better to think of different dimensions ofbeing–experience interacting, taking on many kinds of relations (e.g.,antagonism, fusion, reversibility, oscillation, and less tangible auras towhich we cannot begin to do justice here).APPENDIX 4103"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Note, again, O subtends Godhead and analogues. In a way, thisguards “God” from belief systems about “Him”. It opens fields ofpossibilities having to do with what we call mystery. Much of whatwe say about God is premature closure. This is also true of what wesay about no-God. The binary tends to close off what it tries toexpress.That beta, Godhead, and O are below alpha, or prior to alpha pro-cessing, suggests much goes on that is beyond our range of experience,but profoundly relevant for experience. Much of what has impacts onus might be nameless. To some extent, perhaps we can say impact givesrise to alpha, gives rise to image, gives rise to symbol, gives rise tothought (following and modifying Paul Ricouer).We now think we know something about electromagnetic fields.For most of the human race’s existence, electromagnetic fields wereunknown and whatever ways they might have an impact on our lifeor personalities were unknown. The ancients postulated forces thatcould have something in common with invisible electromagneticfields. They gave expression to sensed impact from unknown pro-cesses, which they tried to elaborate in imaginative vision and reflec-tion. Impacts of the Unknown and Unknowable played an importantrole in peoples lives and belief systems. Bion included reference “frominfra-sensual to ultra-sensual” in O-gram no. 2. He postulated a“psychoanalytic domain” he likened to Teihard de Chardin’s “noos-phere” (1959), part of a larger psychosphere, an intangible domainpartly sensed by intuition (Keter, Chochma) but not accessible bycommon sense or ordinary modes of perception (the lower sephirot).Vast unconscious processes modelled not simply on “repression” buton capacities, what we can and cannot access and work with and how.Processes we need to respect even if we cannot know what they are.At the same time, we process what impacts we can and make use ofthem as we can, through alpha to image, to symbol, to narrative, andthought and vice versa (note that in O-gram no. 2, the arrows pointdownward from upper functions towards O).To help keep some brakes on reductionism, Bion adds that taste,touch, smell, sound, and infra-ultra sensuous possibilities can besubstituted for image in this schema (just as he notes the differentworlds of experience we find through respiration, proprioception,kinaesthesia, digestion, reproduction, and intimations hard to locateof subtle sensory spreads). He hints at vast domains that touch and104APPENDIX 4"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"press us beyond our capacity to access. It is not an accident of ournature that we keep trying to give expression to the unknown onmany levels, many ways, with all the capacities we have.When Bion was in New York, someone asked why he does not useordinary psychoanalytic language, why introduce a term such asalpha? Bion spoke about how little we know about these processes,then commented, “I use alpha like a nest, hoping birds of meaningmight alight”. In a way, he turned the sephirotupside down, butopened doors of possibility. In the Bible, God is sometimes associa-ted with unknown, inaccessible depths. Bion guards these depths,increases our appreciative sense of them. Dogen (1985), a thirteenth-century Zen master, writes that depth is a measure of height. Measure,here, links with measureless (neither height nor depth). Since bothmeasure and measureless are real moments of being, both importantfor the way we live, we might place the former in the numerator, thelatter in the denominator, the two in one expressive token. Or wemight call what is measurable a figure against a measureless back-ground, capable of reversing at any moment.APPENDIX 4105"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"APPENDIX 5Bion’s Grid107Figure 1. Bion’s Grid."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"When Bion was in New York (1978), he placed little emphasison the grid. His main emphasis was on the living session. Inexperiential terms, he felt the lived session was in row C,dream thoughts, dreams, and myths. If you were D through F, thechances were you were not in the session, not in the felt moment. Atmost, the grid was for between session reflection about the emotionalexperience of the lived session, a way of taking a session apart and re-situating it along a number of dimensions that might improve discern-ment of processes. He wrote of it as a kind of psychic exercise, keepingalpha function alive and in repair, keeping intuition alive.As he spoke, I wondered if he was consigning the grid to a kind ofscrap heap, much the same as Husserl did with his early attempts tomathematise consciousness. Husserl decided that a mathematics ofconsciousness was not possible (at least from his horizon) and turnedfull attention to delineating structures of experience and came to beknown as the “father of twentieth century phenomenology”.In the New York seminar, Bion also played down his group book(Bion, 1948). When asked about this early, well-known work, heasked, “Are people still reading that?” I am not sure what his tonewas. It was not simple—possibly a tinge of disparagement, but morelikely amazement or curiosity. I really do not know. I was taken abackby it myself. Later, I wondered if there was some latent disappoint-ment. After all, it was 1978, some thirty years later, and so manypapers on psychotic processes of individuals had been published, thegreat works of the 1960s climaxing in Attention and Interpretation(1970), not to mention his last long work in the 1970s, A Memoir of theFuture(1991), and the seminar that was going on at that very moment.Yet, I doubt it was disappointment or chagrin. It really sounded likesurprise, at once pleasurable and curious.I know many people for whom the group book is Bion. That is thebook they know and read and value, the vast and stunning literaturethat followed notwithstanding. It is as if the latter, with few excep-tions, never was. But there are others for whom the unfolding chainof work is revelatory, ongoing in his last year.I personally like the group book (Experiences in Groups, 1948,republished by Tavistock, 1961). It begins like a Pinter play, a singlespotlight on the analyst alone on the stage. Gradually, patients enterand interactions begin. The analyst, who felt all right alone, nowbegins to undergo various pulls and tugs, emotional deformations108APPENDIX 5"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"under the pressures of group engagement. He tries to pinpoint someof these deformations, describe them. A mini-dictionary of basicassumptions and the forces they exert begins.I would not want to lose the early work. And I would not want tolose the grid. To say Bion has gone further is not to take away fromeach step achieved.I take up the grid here because I loosely connect it with the sephi-rot. It is not a one-to-one connection. There are important differences.But there is overlapping ambience and concern. What I say is notdefinitive, just reflective conjectures, more tentative exploration thanconclusive. Saying this clears the way for me to take some poeticlicence and risks.Others have written about the grid in more detail than I do here,but I want at least to give a broad sketch for the interested reader whomight find the lines of letters, numbers, and words bewildering, evenattacking.The vertical axis, A to H, is often characterised as growth frommore concrete to abstract thought. The binary concrete–abstractoccludes too much and I will try to portray some intricacies. The hori-zontal axis, 1 through 6. . .n, portrays growth of experience towardsaction, leaving the way open for unknown possibilities beyond action.The terms delineated seem crude compared with processes theyexpress. The grid as a whole can be taken to portray growth ofthought, experience, and feeling. I propose that it explores growth ofsensation as well. The forest can easily be lost in the trees, so before Iget bogged down in details, let me say the whole grid quivers, trem-bles, is aglow. It shakes like jelly, ripples, and, like the sephirot, anypart can link with any other and all parts are contained in each other.All parts of the grid, like the sephirot, express transformations.Note that O is missing. Everything on the grid proposes to expressO-impacts and, in one or another way, gives them shape or preparesthem for shaping. As soon as there is impact, it is subject to transfor-mational processing through whatever filter systems our life form ismade of and uses. O is slanted through the “grid” of our makeup. Oneway of saying this is that we have access to what our system does withO-impacts. The O of the O-impact, so to speak, is unknown.The grid begins with beta-elements, “A” on the vertical axis.Above A is a blank. For me, this suggests that a lot of processes go onoff the grid, before reaching the grid, before reaching beta. Let us beAPPENDIX 5109"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"a little wild, and posit Ein Sofoff the grid. Instead of reaching the gridthrough Keter–Chochma, the head, it reaches it through beta, more akinto what the ancient Greeks called hyle, a kind of substance or mattersubject to transformation. Beta is often spoken of as “sensation”, aproblem being how sensation grows towards thought. One might say,the grid roughly parallels the sephirotupside down, with Keter–Chochmaat the bottom. But things are not so simple.In psychosis, thoughts can act as sensations and be taken as realthings, the things themselves. Thoughts, images, and hallucinationsbecome reality. Bion spends a lot of time in his work delineating theseprocesses. Thoughts, feelings, and sensations transform into animatedpresences, inspirited reality.The grid opens the larger question of how things function. Alllocations on the grid represent functions. How does a thought or feel-ing or sensation function? Does it function as a beta object or alphaelement, a dream or myth or preconception, conception, concept?Every thought one meets does not function as a thought, is not neces-sarily part of an ongoing thinking process. Concepts can function asdemons or airy nothings or enter a struggling, genuine attempt tothink. As hinted above, boxes on the grid can fuse or dissociate inmyriad ways.In one of their positive functions, beta objects feed alpha function.Raw registering of impact attracts and stimulates psychic work. Thework might be to shut out the impact. Or continue registering it,unconsciously getting inklings about it, implicit hypotheses (A1),reaching towards notation, attention, enquiry, and action on the hori-zontal plane and towards dream/mythic images–narratives, precon-ceptions, conception (F1) on the vertical. In this mode, some speak ofan alpha-betising function, converting beta impacts through alphafunction into material more usable for growth of experiencing.I wrote of hylein relation to beta, and one can usefully meditate onthe “materiality” of beta impacts, parallel with what Aristotle mighthave meant by hyle. But I would add here a kind of psychic “materi-ality”, unknown psychic material, part of unknown psychic processes,which undergoes transformations through image, symbol, andthought, as the O-grams try to signal.A good part of the literature on beta-objects emphasises their nega-tive aspects, how they interfere with emotional processing. “Agglutin-ated” or demonised beta objects block and destroy psychic flow. They110APPENDIX 5"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"exacerbate persecutory reactions and are projected or evacuated,attempts to get rid of them, creating further persecution.Bion depicts O-impact as a catastrophic big bang, destroyingpsychic space, creating a situation in which psychic objects hurtlethrough expanding space in a more and more unhinged manner. Tosome extent, vertical column 2, the Psi function, slows things down, akind of braking system or contact barrier, permeable but resistant.This enables notation and attention and enquiry on the one hand, anddreaming, mything, and various implicit–explicit thinking processeson the other. He is graphing creativity.The birth of psychic life is depicted in a trauma mode, but capa-cities for creative work with trauma develop. Bion frequently writesof a “choice”: to deny or modify. The grid suggests creative work hasno end. It might also have no beginning. The grid is a depiction ofpossible creative processes against an unknown background. I sug-gested above that much goes on off grid before appearing on grid. Ispoke of the missing O as Ein Sofoff the grid, infinitely unknown, butyou can substitute whatever you think might be a better designationof unknown O.Bion attributes unknown processing to alpha, which plays a rolenear the beginning of emotional digestion. One function needed isnotation. Bion gives the example of recording a happening withimages. Images function like ideograms containing vast complexitiesof a moment, often expressed as opposites as binary narrative devel-ops. The latter makes use of, and develops, operations such ascompare–contrast, same–similar–different. But he is adamant in call-ing attention to unknown work going on in growth of emotionalprocessing from the beginning.Like Kafka, who calls his life an incomplete moment, Bion feels that most dreams are aborted dreams. Dreams (row C) play arole in emotional digestion. For example, they try to work with cata-strophic impacts, but often short-circuit before a “solution” is found.Most people experience dreams that suddenly break off before aconclusion. Perhaps the breaking off is itself a “conclusion”, portray-ing a sense of our fragmented and incomplete existence. In DamagedBonds(2001), I wonder if part of human irritability is associated withwidespread emotional indigestion. What kind of dream will a therapysession be? Can therapy play a role in emotional digestion, or end asanother nightmare?APPENDIX 5111"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Bion feels nightmares serve an important function, potentiallydrawing awareness to emotional trauma. He sees it as an advance tobe able to produce a nightmare rather than a somatic symptom toexpress what frightens one.Yet, with everything we know about dream and defensive opera-tions, Bion keeps the field open. What is attempting to be processedhow? For Bion, we are explorers. If the emotional background of ourbeing is unknown infinity with a million faces (experienced/filteredthrough dread, agony, rage, joy), we are ever partners with endlessunfolding/development.I write of beta objects as mediating raw impacts of O, an impactthat can take on many emotional colourings as processing develops.We do not know what beta objects are. They are something Bion madeup to avoid knowing something we do not.Sometimes, I represent them as raw trauma globs, as yet unspeci-fiable, undefined, awaiting processing and/or evacuation. Alphasomehow works on them, turning them into material useful for learn-ing, growth. An immaterial material, since they are psychic eventswhich cannot be located like a liver or brain (one can see brainprocesses represented by video images, but no one has ever “seen” athought. One thinks thoughts, senses feelings).I tend to see beta as very alive, dense with compacted possibility.I think of the Tao master referring to himself as uncarved stone. Or Michelangelo’s “prisoners”, semi-emerging yet still part of therough stone that is their uncarved background and substance. Or the simple child at the Passover seder, who does not know enough toask, a kind of mute mystic silenced by the overwhelming nature ofthings, dumb with awe. Or myself as a child, who often felt, “What’sgoing on here?” A kind of dumb, quiet state, blank, waiting. I did nothave a clue what was happening until college, when suddenly thelight in the rock began to shine. I have felt like a beta object all my life or, at least, in touch with a beta dimension of existence (pre-existence?).Another trope for beginnings of emotional processing might be lifeemerging in a swamp or marsh, or deep in the sea, mysterious oddforms that fascinate and repel.Fascination with origins is not new in history. Ancients hadnotions of the unformed, the potential. Bion underlines processes thatmake up the things themselves, not simply order imposed from with-112APPENDIX 5"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"out: self-organising and self-destroying processes, interacting withother processes.In Appendix 1, I wrote about the positive contributions sensationmakes in the aliveness, flow, and colour of life. Sensation is not a dullclod, an inert beta object. It can be ineffable, lifting existence. It playsa role in feeling feelings, sensing thoughts. Freud called consciousnessa sense organ for perception of psychical qualities. This is an impor-tant component of Bion’s work, the feeling of life. How does life feel?A sense of life. What is your sense of your life? A question about themicro-infra-world Bion tunes into involves not whether xis beta oralpha, but how does it function? For example, is it moving towardslife, or life-destructive at a given moment? Freud would say, alwaysboth. How does one envision this?Sometimes, the grid is pictured as functioning in reverse. Insteadof a mute sense or intimation growing towards action–thought, thelatter devolves back into nothing, or worse than nothing (Eigen, 1996,Chapter Five, “Bion’s No-thing”).There are malevolent and positivenothings, a negative and positive grid, depending on how a state orcapacity is functioning, often both positive and negative workingtogether as well as seemingly at cross purpose. Freud said that everypsychic act is made up of both life and death instincts—the nega-tive–positive grid is one translation of this vision. This is very likecreative–destructive functions of the sephirot, bringing the soultowards God and towards alienation (remember how agonised RabbiNachman was when feeling so close andso far from God; above,Chapter Two). Or another, less deist plane, a double movementtowards worthwhile existence andself-destruction (Eigen, 2001,Chapter Six, “The need to kill oneself”).The grid lends itself to many uses. For example, it can stimulatemusings on relations between action and thought. Action is the lastfilled-in horizontal category, and features of thought the last on thevertical. They are conjoined in processes signified by A through F.Action can dominate thought or thought dominate action, with manymixtures and variations. Husserl describes thought as a mental act.Action applies to many realms. A range that includes and extendsbeyond beta element acts might be called alpha function acts, dreamacts, on through varied degrees and qualities of higher thought-influ-enced acts. The same can be said on the scale of thought-driven action,for better or worse, depending on the kind of thought and action. WeAPPENDIX 5113"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"are ridden with evil imaginings and ideas. Thoughtful does not neces-sarily mean good, or acting bad. The reverse is often so.At the “highest” thought level on the grid, there is practically nointeraction with the vertical column or, for that matter, with anythingother than itself. An exception is G2, which has a braking function. Forthe rest, “higher” thought can go where it will, unconstrained byanything but itself, although Bion has taken care to call attention toemotional aspects of thought in general. At the top and bottom wereach empty space, openness. Yet, one cannot say H is unconditioned.The whole mass of processes, from A through F, subtend and lead upto it. Bion feels there are emotional substrata of mathematics (we sawa little of this earlier, discussing triangles in Euclid; above, Appendix1). Even the leap into no-constraints has invisible links with unknownprocesses “before” and “after”, or no location in time at all. The grid,then, is like Michelangelo’s prisoners, carved out from a largerunknown horizon, which Bion likens to Teilhard de Chardin’s noo-sphere, a topic discussed in Appendix 6 (Stefanie Teitelbaum, inconversation, originally alerted me to the profound significance ofMichelangelo’s “prisoners”).114APPENDIX 5"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"APPENDIX 6Bion quotesFollowing is a selection of quotes from Bion that are relevant forpsycho-spiritual reflection.

There is inbuilt frustrationin trying to communicate feelings, even communicating them tooneself.

As one looks more closely, difficul-ties representing the Unrepresentable mark the work of emotionalcommunication more generally. Frustration that is part of the attemptto commune–communicate often is taken for granted, or inadequatelyrecognised, making it harder to appreciate this aspect of our situation.It is not uncommon to think we have successfully communicatedsomething important to us, only to be taken aback by layers of misin-terpretation.

This sphere Ishall name by borrowing the term, ‘noosphere’ from Teilhard deChardin [ThePhenomenon of Man], but as I wish to avoid too great apenumbra of associations, particularly those activated by the term,‘sphere’, I shall employ a sign that is as devoid as I can make it(compatible with retention of its capacity for communicability), sigma.(1994b, p. 313)***First, “a mental multi-dimensional space of unthought and unthink-able extent and characteristics”. Within this larger space, “a domain ofthoughts that have no thinker”.The above constitutes beta-space. Meditate on “a mental multi-dimensional space of unthought and unthinkable extent and charac-teristics” and see where it takes you. Also, “thoughts without athinker”.One might think of “a mental multi-dimensional space of un-thought and unthinkable extent and characteristics” as the largerrealm, a background horizon without imaginable time or compass.Within that realm, thoughts without a thinker. In another passage,when discussing the O-grams (1994b, p. 326), Bion calls the unthink-able domain and thoughts without a thinker a psychosphere.Within the psychosphere is what Teilhard de Chardin called thenoosphere. For Teilhard de Chardin it was a further step in evolution,from the physical world, or geosphere, to the animate, or biosphere,to the human mind and makeup which evolves into the noosphere, aunifying, connecting mental–spiritual network (perhaps a parallel toIndra’s net in Buddhism). Noosphere comes from Nous, mind–spiritin ancient Greek philosophy. For Bion, it is a part of the psychospherethat begins thinking thoughts, vast thoughts and survival thoughts,incipient alpha space. As mentioned in his quote, he renames Teilhardde Chardin’s noosphrere, sigma. It might also be that he used Teilhardde Chardin’s Omega (the final “point” of evolution), O, as a generalsign for unknown infinite, ultimate reality.Teilhard de Chardin, a Jesuit palaeontologist, described each suc-cessive stage as emergent realities. For Bion, that might be so, but theytend to function more as simultaneously existing structural processescomplexly interacting with (or, in the case of one of his astronomicalAPPENDIX 6117"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"images, racing away from) each other. The more general unthinkablepsychosphere, and its domain of unthought thoughts—both sub-sumed in the category of beta-space—remains as a kind of infinitebackground and horizon as alpha-space, sigma, and thoughts with athinker develop. Bion gives as examples of constellations of alpha-elements vast thoughts like “void”, “formless infinite”, “god”, “infin-ity”. Thoughts about the unthinkable. A good deal of human thinkingreaches towards the unthinkable.Alpha function opens a path towards thinking about psychologi-cal life without confining it to a visible body. Terms like “mood”,“character”, “personality”, “anxiety” point to realities that are notidentical with physical identity. Similarly, for Bion, psychoanalyticrealities constitute a “psychoanalytic domain” (1994b, pp. 325–326)which is not accessed by ordinary thinking or discourse, but requiresdevelopment of a special capacity for intuition, characterised by beingwithout memory, desire, understanding, and expectation.The latter might be an impossible state, yet is a direction or path,a way of exercising a specific capacity, even stimulating its birth anddevelopment. Alpha-space is capable of growth, its limits unknown.You can develop your own links, similarities, and differences withintuition in Jewish mysticism and the sephirot. Remember, each sephiraincludes and communicates with all other ones, so that intuition(represented by higher sephirot) can function to investigate and workwith lower “spheres” as well as to open paths towards “that” beyondall spheres.For Bion, it is harder to tell what is higher or lower and, if he could,I suspect he would eliminate hierarchical directionality from descrip-tions of psychic space, realities, and possibilities. Communicationwith the language we have is very demanding, especially when we tryto use it to express something it was not made to express. Bion writesof the difficulty of using a frame of mind and discourse that grew upin the service of survival for illuminating psychological concerns,issues of integrity, and personal development.Mind keeps trying to blow itself up, go beyond itself, shed shells.I think of diverse images from East and West: Moses seeking to free apeople from slavery. The biblical trope involving freedom from slav-ery in Egypt links to a word, mitzrayin, related to limit, limitations—freedom from limitations. For a Christian gloss on the same theme,Nikolai Berdyaev, Slavery and Freedom(1975), faith in Christ as a free-118APPENDIX 6"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"ing path. For Buddha, freedom from slavery to our minds, life, dispo-sition, and tyranny of self.What kind of seeing, experiencing, intuiting, vision is discoveredand is in the process of discovery?Development of psychoanalytic intuition poses challenges forpractitioners. Intuitive sensing, vision, or processing can make anindividual more sensitive to psychotic ranges of experience. So muchof what an everyday individual slides past, hides, ignores, versions ofself, identities taken for granted, might open access to fearedpsychotic processes. Intuition contacts “pellucid” and “turbulent”areas of sigma, opening windows the personality tries to seal.Intuition opens worlds unperceived by the habitual self. Forexample,dreams would need to be thought of as belonging to a far more widelyextended C category [see Appendix 5, Bion’s Grid], much moreextended than one enclosing only visual or any other sensuous images,though in ‘practical’ psychoanalysis only elements within the sensuousrange would, by definition, be experienced. Sooner or later, the inves-tigation would have to be extended to infra- and ultra-sensuous areasfirst, then from noosphere to psychosphere. (1994b, p. 326)To try to evoke a sense of what he points to, Bion writes of bigSigma and small sigma, the latter referring to the flesh and bloodperson we see before us, the former to unseen, unknown psychic real-ities. (1994b, pp. 313–317). All our capacities come into play, work atonce. All the knowledge (K) we gain from ordinary philosophical andscientific cognition, and domains of “inaccessible” realities revealedby faith (F). Bion calls F the psychoanalytic attitude, radically openingto the unknown.The practical me writes unknown in a process sense, althoughmystical me might mean more. Bion writes that in a session he isconcerned with what he does not know, the unknown. Once heknows, there is more unknown. Opening of vistas that cannot beexhausted can be a source of depression for the patient. Just as thepatient thought he solved the puzzle of his personality, infinities ofunknown areas are sighted, dots of the Unknowable.A lot of work goes on without quite knowing (K) what it is. Onemay sense something, an intimation, a felt change, without know-ing what it is. Something is happening, we may say. Something isAPPENDIX 6119"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"happening we as yet have no words for. In the Lankavatara sutra,much transformation goes on without language, image, conception.Bion’s sign, T in O, links with such processes. F in O and T in O.

We might see Buddha as one possi-ble signifier of a resurrected state, not so much the redemptivemoment as the moment achieved, post-redemption. He sought toremove a “thorn from his heart” and is said to have felt he did this(Blomfield, 2011): a thorn with a long history and many names.***These poets and artists have their methods of recording their aware-ness of some sort of influence, stimuli that come from without, theunknown that is so terrifying and stimulates such powerful feelingsthat they cannot be described in ordinary terms . . . We need to inventsome form of articulate speech that could approximate to describingthese realities, the phenomena that I cannot possibly describe. (1994b,p. 369)***The sentences left out of the preceding quotation had to do with situ-ating experiences that Bion was pointing to sub-cortically—”thala-mic” experiences “with no real synaptic communication between thethalamus and the subsequent development of the mind”. He had beenspeaking of realities communicated by Tennyson, Shelley, and Keats,but also a direct hit of a tank in the unit he helped command: “bodieswere charred and blackened, and poured out of the door of the tankas if they were the entrails of some mysterious beast of a primitivekind which had simply perished then and there in the conflagration”(1994b, p. 368).120APPENDIX 6"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"He went on to talk about the mystery of a word like “Yaveh”,whose meaning, spelling, and pronunciation are unknown-unknownbecause nothing else could possibly do any sort of justice to the factthat ‘Yaveh’ was a way of talking about a force, a power that cannotbe described in articulate speech such as is appropriate when talkingabout omnipotence or omniscience, or the ordinary formulations ofreligion—none of them adequate ways of describing the matters towhich attention is to be drawn by the communication. (1994b, p. 370)It is freeing to think that the ordinary ways we speak of God do notcome close to the mysterious experience touching us. Such wordseclipse the experience they try to communicate, reducing it to fantasyor wish-fulfilment—ah, to be omnipotent, omniscient. Thank God, weare not. Bion tries to clear what we call God of these dilutions andpollutions. (See the section, “God’s personality” in Rage, Eigen, 2002.)***Many mystics have been able to describe a situation in which it isbelieved there really is a power, a force that cannot be measured orweighted or assessed by the mere human beings with the mere humanmind. This seems to me to be a profound assumption which has hith-erto been almost completely ignored, and yet people talk about‘omnipotence’ as if they knew what it meant and as if it had a simpleconnotation. Martin Buber [1970] came much closer to recognizing therealities of the situation when human speech is resorted to . . . Whenone talks about ‘I–You’, the significant thing is not the two objectsrelated, but the relationship—that is, an open-ended reality in whichthere is no termination (in the sense that this is understood by ordi-nary human beings). The language of ordinary human beings is onlyappropriate to the rational, can describe only the rational, can onlymake statements in terms of rationality. (1994b, p. 371)***Any particular religion changes with the prevalent fashion, but thefundamental thing, religion itself, does not. It is a very powerful force,as can be seen by the evidence of what would appear to be a sign orsymptom of the thought of a period dug up by the archaeologists whoexcavated the Death Pit of Ur. Apparently, when the ruling authoritydied, the court also died with him; they were all buried in the same pitand took the same dose of whatever was used before they were buriedAPPENDIX 6121"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"alive. That in itself would seem to suggest that the religious force is avery powerful one, whether it is located in God, or the people, or thepriesthood, or the court authorities. (1994b, p. 374)***I add the above quote to emphasise that the unknown Bion alludes tois not “controllable” by language or desire. It seems monstrous; itseems divine. Or it exceeds all categories. In the Bhagavad Gita,Krishna makes a monstrous appearance, yet is in all things andmore— isall things. In part, the “monstrousness” has to do withhuman perception and awareness being unable to take full dosage ofdivinity/reality. We see many demons and monsters in Buddhist art,having to do with demonic tendencies in life and mind, but also withdeformations of vision owing to lack of capacity to take too muchintensity of experience, a theme Bion emphasises. In the Bible, we aretold to see God is to die. One way we tend to translate this is thatseeing God leads to a kind of death of narrower vision, opening big-vision.Literature about Job in recent years tends to emphasise his slav-ishness to God, being cowed by show of strength. In one translation,he never stops arguing, never gives in to God’s evil. In one of my own“takes”, I feel Job has cut away everything, coming upon the Oneremaining and, in a burst of spontaneous awe and miraculous appre-hension, is thrown past speech into the thing itself, the very MomentGod Appears, contact with the Unknown. Cutting away everything isa movement of contraction; his new life, new family, new land repre-sents a movement of expansion after the Amazing Vision and Contact,Moment of Reality of Realities. When we come back down to earth,we are left with our questions, yet also something more.In another “take” or state, it is hard to get past the reality of evil,mine, yours, ours, humankind’s. In psychoanalysis, we take littlenibbles at a time, although sometimes we go overboard and findourselves being eaten, both chewed and swallowed whole, by thegreat monster in one of its profiles.***When the patient said he dreamed he was being swept down the riverto the weir—”I tell you, I never woke up so fast in my life.”—what,122APPENDIX 6"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"according to me, was he talking about? In so far as I know, I was in astate of mind in which I am wide awake. Is that ‘wide’ enough? Or is it a state of mind that is too narrow—like ‘to–fro tender trambeams’truckling ‘at the eye’? [Gerard Manley Hopkins, “The CandleIndoors”] Or too ‘wide’ awake, too conscious, too rational?‘By that window’[idem] what sights did the patient see that made him‘wake up’ so fast that he could not be swept down the stream? Was itthe danger of becoming, like me, too wide awake? Or, like me, too fastasleep—in fact, the sleep of death? Or in the state of mind of ‘sleep’ ofpsychoanalysis?‘There plant eyes, all mist from thence purge and disperse, that Imight see and tell of things invisible to mortal sight’. [Milton, ParadiseLost, Book III] But the price appears to be the loss of ‘mortal’ sight. Itcannot, however, be bought by ‘losing’ mortal sight; to be blind,unconscious, unaware of the world visible and audible, where you arein the ‘yin’ state of mind, is not the solution. One must dare to beaware—consciously—of the universe that is apparent in the state ofmind in which one is asleep and the state of mind appropriate to‘awake’. Yin and Yang. Therefore merely being able to concoursemusically, balletically, athletically, is not enough; it must be an inter-course—a means of communication ‘inter’, between two states ofmind. Socrates described himself as a mental midwife; perhaps thepsychoanalyst is a midwife between two states of mind of theanalysand. (1994b, pp. 366–367)***A term like ‘love’ cannot describe something even as well as the term,‘the love of God’—that at least makes an attempt to introduce anelement that shows it is not a discussion about something that is sosimple as physical love known to the human animal. A lioness nuzzlesand shows every sign of feelings of love and affection—if interpretedin human terms—for prey it has destroyed; but it is murderous love,the love that destroys the loved object. Such visual images may beused to talk about love, even what we imagine to be mature love, butthere is some other love that is mature from an absolute standard. Thisother love, vaguely adumbrated, vaguely foreshadowed in humanspeech, is of an entirely different character; it is not simply a quanti-tative difference in the kind of love one animal has for another orwhich the baby has for the breast. It is the further extension to‘absolute love’, which cannot be described in the terms of sensuousAPPENDIX 6123"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"reality or experience. For that there has to be a language of infra-sensuous and ultra-sensuous, something that lies outside the spec-trum of sensuous experience and articulate language. It may beapproximated to by methods of communication that are not purelysensuous; the artist who paints a little street in Delft can see andcommunicate a reality to the observer who then sees something that isquite different from any brick wall or little house that he has everknown or seen in his life. Even in science, Heisenberg’s description ofthe Uncertainty Principle shows that already a crises has arisen—a‘crise de foi’. (1994b, pp. 371–372)***All my life I have been imprisoned, frustrated, dogged by common-sense, reason, memories, desires and—greatest bug-bear of all—understanding and being understood.This is my attempt to express my rebellion, to say ‘Good-bye’ to allthat. It is my wish, I now realized doomed to failure, to write a bookunspoiled by any tincture of common-sense, reason, etc. (see above).So although I would write, ‘Abandon Hope all ye who expect to findany facts—scientific, aesthetic, religious—in this book’, I cannot claimto have succeeded. All these will, I fear, be seen to have left theirtraces, vestiges, ghosts hidden within these words, even sanity, like‘cheerfulness’, will creep in. However successful my attempt, therewould always be the risk that the book ‘became’ acceptable,respectable, honoured, and unread. “Why write then?” you may ask.To prevent someone who knows from filling the empty space—but Ifear I am being ‘reasonable’, that great Ape.

They con-dense aspects of his spiritual experience written about in ChapterTwo, above, and in Green’s (2004) Tormented Master: The Life andSpiritual Quest of Rabbi Nahman of Bratslav, which I draw from. Do not be confused by the different spellings of Rabbi Nachman’s name.Green uses Nahman; others like Kamenetz (2010), also a backgroundsource for Chapter Two, use Nachman. I use Nachman because I grew up spelling the gutteral throat growl-like sound “ch”. Neitherspelling conveys the actual sound in Yiddish or Hebrew.While elaborations are in Chapter Two, I thought a list of RabbiNachman’s paths might be helpful. The list is not meant to becomplete but suggestive.***1.Emotions as messengers. Nachman enjoyed and suffered intensitiesof experience, moments of closeness to God and moments ofghastly separation, unbridgeable distance. His states echo emo-tions in the psalms, the psalmist bereft, cast into the abyss when125"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"God withdraws, joyous when again God’s face shines. A kind ofdouble movement of towards–away. One does not know whenGod withdraws or the soul withdraws, and vice versa. Which-ever extreme he lived, Nachman felt emotions as paths to andfrom God.2.Incubation. Nachman felt there was a time to be silent, to hide,withdraw from company or, at least, minimise full exposure ofwhat was brewing. Often it was important to nourish secret innerprocesses, to let them germinate. Premature exposure coulddamage them, aborting potential spiritual life.3. Constant struggle. This can be inner and/or outer struggle.Struggle with one’s own personality and struggle with the world.There comes a time to come out and struggle with the world, atime when such struggle not only urges one to give expression to oneself, but stimulates further growth. Nachman frequentlyremarked that he was always growing, going further, not makingdo with status quo. He felt a spiritual developmental impera-tive.4. Nature and music. Like the Baal Shem Tov, Nachman valuedcommunion with nature, which was soul nourishing in manyways. He felt all nature alive with song. Shepherds who sangnourished the grass, which nourished the lambs. Singing, clap-ping hands to the rhythm of prayer, dancing, all expressive ofDivine Presence, soul nourishment. Spirit comes alive throughsong. This reminds me of King David dancing and the music ofthe last psalms. It is said that Nachman danced with such inten-sity that you could not see him move, his stillness was soprofound. His dancing created and discovered new dimensionsin stillness.5.Suffering.Wittgenstein said there were certain sufferings that ledto experiencing God. He would have found a companion inNachman on this score. The deep pain of life, existential suffer-ing, the acute agonies of trauma, loss, and grief, but also spiritualsufferings, longing for the Divine. Nachman traced an ache thatran through many levels, an ache that raced after God, the latterreceding the closer the aching heart came. This ever-present gapensured always going further. Just as one thought one was asintimate as one could get, intimations of still greater intimaciesinvited the soul.126APPENDIX 7"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"While sufferingseems to be part of path no. 1, emotions asmessengers, I felt impelled to give it space of its own, given theemphasis Nachman placed on a certain aching longing in transi-tional movement towards God. Bion, too, writes of the impor-tance of suffering experience. He tends to mean suffering thebuild up of experience, gradually tolerating more of its intensity,and even speaks of suffering joy. Dewey, in Art as Experience(1936) writes of difficulties in tolerating the build up of intensitywhile viewing a work of art. To suffer rather than deny or disownexperience is a problem cutting across many dimensions of life.6.Confession and prayer. These two each deserve a category of theirown but I find it natural to bring them together. Prayer takesmany forms, an abyss of silence, stillness of peace and awe,expressions of thanks, and supplications of all sorts. So manyways of seeking God, communion with God. Song and dance canbe part of prayer, so can weeping, shouting, and begging.Nachman places special emphasis on confession. Not justduring prayer, but confessing aloud to one’s spiritual teacher.Confessing everything that is in one, all doubts, agonies, appre-hensions, needs, disappointment, longing, hurt, anger, and fear.It sounds like a relative to free association in psychoanalysis.Prayer, too, can be a form of confession, and confession a formof prayer. Nachman goes further, urging his followers to speakfrom their hearts, from their broken hearts. Further yet, to breaktheir hearts in prayer and confession. He advocates praying inyour native tongue, the language that comes naturally to you, notnecessarily Hebrew. God understands you, whatever languageyou speak, so speak the language that best conveys what is inyour heart, the language of the heart. A Nachman saying:“Nothing is more whole than a broken heart”.7.I Don’t Know.At times Nachmen felt his knowing, not just hislearning, but inspired teaching of the moment, a knowing thatsuddenly burst forth with light, could make people faint withspiritual apprehension, beauty, awe. Such bursts of holy lightmight be too much for those not ready. One reason Nachmanordered unpublished writings of his to be burned had to do withhis fear of the harm they might cause to a world not ready forsuch heights of illumination. He feared they would do more illthan good.APPENDIX 7127"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"At other times, he felt he knew nothing. Sometimes abjectly,distraught, out of contact, not tuned into the Divine current. Yetother times, he said, “My knowing is great, but my I don’t knowis greater”. He confessed to the most profound not-knowing, ornon-knowing, as a path. While he supported the unlearned inwhatever they knew, he urged the learned to confess non-know-ing. None of us know in face of God and the workings of Life—none of us know. Our faith has intimations and takes us tounknown places.
