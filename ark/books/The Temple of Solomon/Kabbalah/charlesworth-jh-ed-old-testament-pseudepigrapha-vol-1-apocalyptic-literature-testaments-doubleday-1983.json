The ancient Jewish and Jewish-Christian documents that are here called Pseu-depigrapha have in their long history been both problematic and promising in both Jewish and Christian communities. It is heartening to observe that the very publication of this new collection testifies more to their promise than to their problems. An ancient witness to both problem and promise can be found within two late books of the New Testament itself. The Epistle of Jude, in its strong antiheretical polemic, refers at least twice to the language of the book we call 1 Enoch and in a third instance quotes it in an authoritative manner as prophetic. It also refers to a legend about the body of Moses known to us in the book called the Assumption of Moses. The Second Epistle of Peter, generally regarded as the latest of the New Testament books, incorporates much of Jude into its second chapter, but it is very careful to excise all of the allusions to the Pseudepigrapha. The problem to which this situation points is that of the canonical status of the Pseudepigrapha in early Christianity—and the consequent propriety or impropriety of citing them in public documents. Clearly the authors of Jude and 2 Peter reflect different views. This problem persisted for centuries in the Church and can further be seen in the reluctance of some churches to accept Jude into the New Testament because of its controversial sources. In the synagogue the problem did not persist so long, and the decision was clearly against the Pseudepigrapha. The promise to which the episode of Jude and 2 Peter points is the value of studying the Pseudepigrapha for a better understanding of prerabbinic Judaism and of the religious matrix of Christianity. Whatever canonical decisions were taken by the official leadership, it is clear that in popular religious circles, especially Christian ones, this literature continued to be prominent and to influence thought and piety. The most recent decades have seen an astonishing rebirth of scholarly interest in the Pseudepigrapha, and these volumes are an excellent guide to much of it. The renewed interest has been and continues to be stimulated in part by new manuscript discoveries. One thinks of the Dead Sea Scrolls among others. These have provided access to much more extensive knowledge of Judaism in the period immediately following the Old Testament. But perhaps even more important than such a largely accidental factor as manuscript discoveries has been the ever increasing acceptance of historical-critical method on the part of students of the Bible at all levels. To study the Bible by this method involves knowing as much as one can about the biblical world in all of its facets. And this of course includes knowing the Jewish and Christian religious literature that ultimately did not become"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"part of the Bible. What we find, as these volumes show, is a bewildering variety of ideas, styles, and literary genres that is as diversified as the Bible itself yet often quite different from it. One of the merits of this edition, especially when compared to the few earlier ones in modern languages, is that it is inclusive rather than exclusive. It includes much more of the surviving literature than others have. Thus it affords a rich insight into the creative religious imagination from a singularly important formative period in Western religious culture. Readers of these volumes and those who consult them for reference should include scholars and teachers, students, and any others who have an interest in the biblical world. All will be grateful to the many scholars who have contributed to the work. But more especially, they will have an enormous debt of gratitude to Professor Charlesworth and his immediate associates who boldly undertook and so competently executed the formidable task of editing this major work. FOREWORD FOR CHRISTIANS JAMES T. CLELAND As one brought up in the home of a Church of Scotland minister, my father, and as one prepared for the Christian ministry in the Divinity Hall of Glasgow University, I have been trying to recall any unique impact made upon me by these related experiences, apart from family worship; the daily reading of the Word of God: Genesis to Revelation, one chapter per night, before falling asleep. The unexpected outcome is that I still find it somewhat difficult to decide if a Scots Presbyterian is an Old Testament Christian, with a stress on the Law and the Psalms, or a New Testament Jew, who attends his synagogue—as Jesus' custom was—on the sabbath day (Luke 4:16). There he hears a sermon which may be based on the Old Testament, or on the New Testament, or on both, as equally valid, equally authoritative. Why not? Is it not the same God in both testaments? Many years later, in a Duke Divinity School morning chapel service, instead of a meditation, I just read the Prayer of Manasseh, now recognized, in its own right, as one of the Pseudepigrapha. After the service, a colleague asked me, 4 4Where did you find that?\" I told him. His surprised, almost awed, comment was: \"That is the gospel outside of the Gospels.\" Why such a reaction? Manasseh was acknowledged to be the wickedest king of Judah, one who both majored and minored in iniquity, and yet maintained his throne in Jerusalem for fifty-five years, which was something of a record. Dr. James Moffatt sums up Manasseh, that royal rake, in a few simple words: \"He did ample evil in the sight of the eternal to vex him\" (2Chr 33:6). That is the emphasis of underemphasis. However, Manasseh repented; he prayed; God forgave (2Chr 33:13). The God who forgave is the same, yesterday, today, and forever, the God of Jew and Christian alike. What I, a pulpiteer, hope from this volume, supervised by Professor Charlesworth,"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"xi FOREWORD aided and abetted by scholars throughout the world, is that, as never before, Judaism and Christianity will be recognized as heirs of the same God, with what Jew and Christian have in common uniting us, rather than continuing a separation which may be emotionally understandable but is spiritually devitalizing. The very text of parts of the Pseudepigrapha may have been edited by later Jews or Christians. It would be good if one of the scholars discovered in his research that a section was prepared by Jew and Christian working together, not always in agreement in minor matters, but one in scholarship and editing because each had faith, academic and spiritual, in the same Father, who is at the heart of both testaments, and to be found in the Pseudepigrapha. So, may it come to pass that what unites us as brethren will far surpass what seems to separate us, too often, even too willingly. We need each other. We are both children of the Kingdom, and the Pseudepigrapha may become a bridge between the Old and New testaments, helping us cross to and fro, back and forth, until we are equally at home in both, to our mental satisfaction, and our spiritual growth in grace. So read the Prayer of Manasseh in the Pseudepigrapha. It is a model for a prayer, public or private: the invocation of God: \"O Lord, God of our fathers, . . . unending and immeasurable are your promised mercies\" (vss. 1-6); the confession of sin, verses 9-10: \"O Lord, I am justly afflicted . . . because I did evil things before you\"; the entreaty for forgiveness, verses 11-15, including the wonderful metaphor of complete surrender to God: \"And now behold I am bending the knees of my heart\" (v. 11); \"Forgive me, O Lord, forgive me\" (v. 13); \"I shall praise you continually all the days of my life\" (v. 15). It is a bonny prayer; my gratitude to the Jew who wrote it. I shall use it. This prayer is to more than a few people the most famous instance of \"the infinite compassion of God.\" If a Manasseh can be absolved, there is hope for anyone—including me. No wonder that I bend \"the knees of my heart.\" It is the gospel outside the Gospels. FOREWORD FOR JEWS SAMUEL SANDMEL By the strangest quirk of fate respecting literature that I know of, large numbers of writings by Jews were completely lost from the transmitted Jewish heritage. These documents stem roughly from 200 B.C. to A.D. 200. Not only the so-called Pseudepigrapha, but even such important and extensive writings as those by Philo and Josephus have not been part of the Jewish inheritance from its past; these were preserved and transmitted by Christians. It was rather only in the backwash of the Renaissance that Jews began to encounter Philo and Josephus. A sixteenth-century Italian rabbi, Azariah de Rossi, in a book called Me-or Enayim (\"Light for the"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Eyes\"), inaugurated this Jewish rediscovery of the \"lost\" literature. He wrote with great praise of Philo, but with only reserved admiration for Josephus, whose Jewish loyalty he doubted. After de Rossi, Jews began slowly to deepen their study of Josephus and Philo, and thereafter the other literature, as legitimate parts of the Jewish heritage. The ancient literary legacy which Jews did preserve and transmit was primarily the rabbinic literature. This huge body of writings might be divided into three categories: one, the Midrashim; two, Mishna and Gemara; and three, the Targumim. The Midrashim are commentaries on Scripture arranged according to the sequence of the biblical verses. The Mishna is a laconic statement of the secondary laws (Halacha) derived from Scripture. The Targumim allude to the Aramaic translation of Scripture; these translations have come down to us in differing styles and in somewhat differing ages. While within the rabbinic literature, especially in passages called haggadic (\"narrative\"), there are allusions to some of the documents found in the Apocrypha and occasionally to those in the Pseudepigrapha, it is only Ecclesiasticus (Jesus, the son of Sirach) who figures in any prominence at all in the talmudic literature. The Pseudepigrapha as such might be said with very little exaggeration to be without reflection in rabbinic literature. As is known, the Pseudepigrapha were first gathered by Johannes Fabricius in the early part of the eighteenth century. Subsequent collectors of this material were able to add certain books that were unknown to Fabricius and certain editors, such as R. H. Charles, included in editions of the Pseudepigrapha materials the presence of which might be questioned. Charles, for example, included the talmudic tractate the Ethics of the Fathers. The point is that there is no such thing as a \"canon\" of the Pseudepigrapha. Rather, there is an abundance of this scattered literature, some of it preserved in entirety and some preserved in part, usually in translation rather than in the original Hebrew or Aramaic. It is in reality only in the eighteenth century that the earnest and ever increasing study of the Pseudepigrapha began. Because most of the Pseudepigrapha were not preserved in Hebrew or Aramaic, it has been only the rare Jewish scholar who has made this study a major concern. By and large it has been Christians who have done the painstaking work of gathering this material, comparing the various manuscripts, producing critical editions, and providing translations into modern languages. I do not think it is wrong to say that much of the Christian interest in the Pseudepigrapha in the early nineteenth century was based on the light this literature was deemed to throw on early Christianity. Since the documents in the Pseudepig­rapha were not being studied for their own sake, often that roundedness which one should expect from the best of scientific scholarship was absent. Even more to be deplored was the circumstance that there were Christian scholars who seemed to feel the need to choose, as it were, between the Pseudepigrapha on the one hand and the rabbinic literature on the other hand, and who, on the basis of only part of the total Jewish literary productivity, came to some occasionally quixotic or reckless or even partisan conclusions about the nature of Judaism at the time of the birth of Christianity. Such an allegation would not be unjust respecting R. H. Charles. A complete turnaround in the approach to the Pseudepigrapha in the last decades has been most gratifying. These writings have become the object of study for their own sake, part of the wish to illuminate the totality of the Jewish creativity of that"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"bygone age. The recent scholarship has not tried to make the literature fit into a procrustean bed for some parochial purpose. It should be said that the relevancy of the Pseudepigrapha to early Christianity is not in any way diminished by the recent admirable mode of the study of Pseudepigrapha. The result of the work of fine scholars, such as are represented herein, has been a significant broadening and deepening of the appreciation of the Jewish literary creativity. The cooperative study enlisting the gifted minds of Christians of various denominations and Jews of varying backgrounds is surely as moving and exciting a development as any cooperative academic venture could be. Perhaps it was the abundance of this ancient literature which the author of Ecclesiastes had in mind when he spoke rather cynically in these words: \"of making many books there is no end and most of them are a weariness of the flesh.\" Obviously the author of Ecclesiastes did not admire every bit of writing that was in his ken. I do not think that the modern student needs to admire every example of the Pseudepigrapha, any more than we today need to regard every novel as a masterpiece. But he can still be astonished, amazed, enlightened, and overwhelmed by the abundance and variety and recurrent high quality of the Jewish literary activity of that period. Old as this literature is for most modern people, it is also in a sense something brand-new, for most American laypeople have never heard the word Pseudepigrapha, or, if they have heard it, are not sure what it means. Now through the work of Professor Charlesworth and his associates a door is being opened anew to treasures that are very old. How gratifying it is that scholars devote themselves to the recovery of that which was lost or strayed or hidden. How gratifying that cooperative study is reviving this literature. How much such study contributes to understanding the richness of the Jewish legacy, now the heritage of both Jews and Christians."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"EDITOR'S PREFACE The present work is designed for the scholar and for the interested non-specialist. The general introduction, the introductions to each subdivision and to each document, and the translations with accompanying notes are shaped to help the reader understand these ancient writings. At the outset it is wise to stress three caveats for the general reader: 1) The following collection of writings, many of which claim to preserve a message from God for his people, are not gathered here in order to replace or add to those scriptures considered canonical by Jews or the larger collections claimed to be canonical by various groups of Christians. 2) In order to understand the Bible better the Pseudepigrapha should not be read in isolation, but along with the writings collected in the Old and New testaments (terms used for convenience and without confessional bias), and in ten other collections of ancient Jewish or early Christian writings (see Introduction). 3) The expanded definition of the Pseudepigrapha, now universally recognized as necessary by scholars, represents a more extended historical period than Charles's selection of writings; hence it must not be used prima facie as a group of writings representative of Early Judaism. The late documents, and Christian expansions of early Jewish writings, as the contributors themselves clarify, must not be read as if they were composed by contemporaries of the early ones. Conversely, late writings must not be ignored in a search for ideas possibly characteristic of Early Judaism; these documents frequently preserve edited portions of early Jewish writings. In the fall of 1972, an editor at Doubleday, John J. Delaney, on the advice of his consultants, invited me to prepare a new edition of the Pseudepigrapha. The present work, completed ten years later, is the product of an international team of collaborators. Because it is a widely used term today, we have decided to retain the technical term \"Pseudepigrapha\"; it is explained in the following Introduction. Each contributor was asked to discuss all issues requisite for a meaningful reading of the document translated, and given some freedom in utilizing the following format: The contributor begins the presentation either with a synopsis of the narrative or with a discussion of the key characteristics and central ideas in a non-narrative writing. Texts. The scholar discusses only the most important extant texts, and clarifies the textual base or the critical edition behind the translation. Original Language. The translator briefly discusses the original language of the document, reviews published scholarly conclusions, and usually advocates one possibility. Date. The contributor assesses the debates (if any) over the date of the original composition, explains, if appropriate, the dates of any subsequent expansions or interpolations, and then presents his or her own scholarly opinion."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Provenance. The expert briefly evaluates the hypotheses regarding the place or places in which the work may have been composed, and subsequently voices his or her own judgment. Historical Importance. The contributor discusses the importance of the document for an appreciation of the historical period in which it was composed. Theological Importance. The specialist explains the motifs, symbols, and major theological ideas contained in the pseudepigraphon. Relation to Canonical Books. The expert assesses the possible relationships between the pseudepigraphon and writings now customarily judged canonical. Relation to Apocryphal Books. The scholar succinctly discusses the apocryphal books to which the document is especially close. Cultural Importance. If appropriate, the contributor discusses the importance of the pseudepigraphon for a better understanding of the origin of our culture. Briefly mentioned are possible parallels between it and the great classics, such as Plato's Dialogues, Dante's Divina Commedia, and Milton's Paradise Lost. At the end of each introduction to a document the contributor lists the most important publications on the document. The organization of these documents follows considerable discussion with the Board of Advisors and the contributors themselves. Any system for ordering these documents has weaknesses. A listing of the documents in chronological order is impractical at the present time. We are still uncertain about the date or dates of compositioii for many of these writings; moreover, some are composite and represent more than one century. Merely placing them in alphabetical order is attractive in the sense that one knows where a particular document is in such a recognized sequence; hence, an alphabetical listing on the endpapers of this volume. An alphabetical listing is confusing, however, because some of the documents collected below are known by more than one title, some may be listed alphabetically according to more than one word in the title, and—most importantly— an alphabetical order is artificial and does not signal the relationships between documents that are related. We have decided to organize the documents according to broadly conceived literary types. Within these groups they are listed chronolog­ically in terms of the earliest probable date with the exception that cycles of traditions, like the Enoch and Ezra books, are grouped together. In the past scholars often felt free to emend a text and to aim at a loose idiomatic translation (although Charles himself was a literalist). Modern scholarship has demanded more rigorous devotion to extant readings, more thorough attempts to understand the grammar and syntax of ancient languages, and, in general, more loyalty to the manuscripts. While we have aimed whenever possible at an idiomatic rendering, we have avoided the temptation to paraphrase the meaning of a complicated passage or to conceal sometimes confusing readings behind elegant English prose. Besides trustworthiness to the transmitted text, there are other advantages in these literal renderings: The reader is introduced to the flavor of ancient expressions, phrases, and images. We have also presented literal translations of texts written in a language two or three times removed from that of the lost original. For example, Pseudo-Philo is extant in Latin but the original was composed in another language, probably Hebrew. The same situation lies behind 1 Enoch and Jubilees; both seem to derive ultimately from a Semitic language, which may be immediately behind the Ethiopic or be separated from it by an intermediary Greek version. The preparation of this volume has been financed by generous grants and gifts"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"xvii EDITOR'S PREFACE from the Phillips Investment Corporation, the Phillips family, the Mary Duke Biddle Foundation, Brigham Young University's Religious Studies Center, Ray­mond and Hazel Mueller, Frances DeMott, the Welch family, and the Duke University Research Council.

CHARLESWORTH Western culture has been largely shaped by a unique collection of ancient books: the Bible. Not only our culture's language, but also its theology, philosophy, art, and law have been affected profoundly by the ideas, symbols, morality, commit­ments, perceptions, and dreams preserved in the biblical books. In the attempt to understand these books, scholars, especially since the time of the European Enlightenment, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, have coupled an intensive study of them with a search for other ancient writings related to them. The Search for lost writings Mere perusal of the biblical books discloses that their authors depended upon sources that are no longer extant. We know so little about these sources that we cannot be certain of the extent to which they were actual documents. A list of these lost sources would be extensive; it would include at least the following: the Book of the Wars of Yahweh (Num 21:14), the Book of the Just (Josh 10:13, 2Sam 1:18), the Book of the Acts of Solomon (lKgs 11:41), the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel (lKgs 14:19, 2Chr 33:18; cf. 2Chr 20:34), the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah (lKgs 14:29, 15:7), the Annals of Samuel the seer (IChr 29:29), the History of Nathan the prophet (2Chr 9:29), the Annals of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer (2Chr 12:15), the Annals of Jehu son of Hanani (2Chr 20:34), an unknown and untitled writing of Isaiah (2Chr 26:22), the Annals of Hozai (2Chr 33:18), and an unknown lament for Josiah by Jeremiah (2Chr 35:25). In the Apocrypha (defined below) lost books also are mentioned; in particular, 1 Maccabees 16:24 refers to the Annals of John Hyrcanus. Within the Pseudepigrapha themselves there are references to \"documents\" now lost (cf. e.g. TJob 40:14,41:6, 49:3,50:3). Christianity and rabbinic Judaism evolved within a milieu that was distinguished by considerable and significant literary activity. Some of the documents composed during the early centuries have been transmitted by copyists; many remain lost; and others have been recovered during the last two centuries. The search for lost writings is aided by ancient lists of \"extracanonical\" books. One of these lists is a catalogue, perhaps from the sixth century, falsely attributed to Athanasius of Alexandria (c. 296-373). The author includes among the disputed parts of the Old Testament (ta antilegomena tes palaias diathekes), the four Books of the Maccabees (1-4 Mac), the Psalms and Ode (sic) of Solomon. He defines the Apocrypha of the Old Testament (ta de apokrupha palin tes palaias diathekes tauta) as follows:"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Enoch Elijah the Prophet Patriarchs Zephaniah the Prophet Prayer of Joseph Zechariah the Father of John Testament of Moses Baruch Assumption of Moses Habakkuk (And the) pseudepigrapha Ezekiel (pseudepigrapha) of Abraham Daniel Eldad and Modad Eldad and Modad All of the documents judged to be disputed parts of the Old Testament or the Apocrypha (if we understand their titles correctly) are included, if only fragmen-tarily, in the present collection, except for 1 and 2 Maccabees (which belong in the Apocrypha), and except for the lost pseudepigrapha attributed to Habakkuk and Zechariah (which is to be placed among the New Testament Pseudepigrapha because it is related to Zechariah the father of John the Baptist). Numerous writings not mentioned by Pseudo-Athanasius are included in this volume. Many of these are named in other canonical lists, notably the List of Sixty Books (c. sixth to seventh century?) and the list of Mechitar of Ayrivank4 (c. 1290). Others do not appear in any early list. Some pseudepigrapha mentioned in medieval lists are not included; they are judged to be characteristically different from and too late for the present collection (see below). The search continues for documents not yet found but cited in the classical lists: an Apocryphon of Larnech (Sixty Books), the Interdiction of Solomon (Gelasian Decree), and the Book of the Daughters of Adam (Gelasian Decree; perhaps this document is another name for Jubilees). Likewise scholars are seeking to understand the origin of ancient quotations from or allusions to unnamed Jewish apocryphal documents. Many of these citations or traditions are preserved by the Church Fathers, especially Clement of Rome, Clement of Alexandria, Hippolytus, Tertullian, Origen, and the compiler of the Apostolic Constitutions, as well as by the Byzantine chroniclers (especially George Syncellus [c. 800] and George Cedrenus [c. 1057]). The present edition of the Pseudepigrapha reflects the search for lost writings. We have included many apocryphal documents, fragmentary or complete, which may be related to those named in the canonical lists or cited by the Church Fathers; note, for example, the following: Apocalypse of Adam, Apocalypse of Abraham, Testament of Abraham, Prayer of Joseph, Eldad and Modad (still preserved in only one brief quotation), Apocalypse of Elijah, Apocryphon of Ezekiel, Apocalypse of Zephaniah, and Apocalypse of Ezra. Many documents, recently discovered in the Near East or recognized in distinguished libraries, are translated here into English for the first time. Not including the documents placed in the Supplement, the writings now available for the first time in English are the Testament of Adam, the Testaments of Isaac and Jacob (from the Arabic), the Apocalypse of Daniel, the Revelation of Ezra, the Vision of Ezra, the History of Joseph, Syriac Menander, and the History of the Rechabites (from the Syriac). Additional writings translated for the first time in a full English translation are the Questions of Ezra, the Ladder of Jacob, Jannes and Jambres, and the Apocalypse of Sedrach. In addition to these documents, four writings presented only in a truncated version in Charles's edition are presented here in their full extant form. From the"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Martyrdom of Isaiah Charles himself included only chapters 1, 2, 3, and 5; the present edition presents all of that document along with the other traditions now preserved in the Martyrdom and Ascension of Isaiah. From 2 Enoch Forbes and Charles omitted the conclusion to the document; the present edition includes chapters 68 through 73, which contain the fascinating account of Melchisedek's miraculous birth. From the Sibylline Oracles Lanchester collected only the fragments and Books 3, 4, and 5; the present edition includes all of the Sibylline Oracles now extant. Finally, from 4 Ezra Box selected chapters 3-14; the present edition also includes the Christian additions (chapters 1 and 2, and 15 and 16). Canon The preceding discussion brings forward the question of the origin of the closed canons of the Old and New testaments. Impressive research is presently focused upon these issues, and it is possible to summarize only briefly my own opinions regarding this complex issue. For a long time scholars postulated that two canons of the Old Testament developed, one in Palestine and another in Egypt, and that Alexandrian Jews added the Apocrypha (see below) to the Hebrew canon. It now seems clear that there never was a rival Alexandrian canon. Philo and other Jews in Alexandria did not cite the Apocrypha, and the Alexandrian Church Fathers witness to the fact that Alexandrian Jews did not have an expanded canon. When R. H. Charles published his edition of the Pseudepigrapha there was widespread agreement that the Hebrew canon, the Old Testament, was fixed finally at Jamnia around A.D. 90. Today there is considerable debate regarding the importance of the rabbinic school at Jamnia in the history of the codification of the Hebrew canon. On the one hand, it is becoming obvious that the process of canonization began long before the first century A.D., and that perhaps the earliest part of the Bible, the Law, had been closed and defined as authoritative well before the second century B.C., and the Prophets surely by that time. On the other hand, it is clear that after A.D. 90 there were still debates regarding the canonicity of such writings as the Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, and Esther, but it is not clear what were the full ramifications of these debates. It seems to follow, therefore, both that the early pseudepigrapha were composed during a period in which the limits of the canon apparently remained fluid at least to some Jews, and that some Jews and Christians inherited and passed on these documents as inspired. They did not necessarily regard them as apocryphal, or outside a canon. The writings collected into the New Testament were written during the end of this same period since they are dated from about A.D. 50 to 150. The New Testament canon was not closed in the Latin Church until much later; certainly not before the late fourth century and long after Constantine the Great established Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire. All the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, for example, are listed for the first time as the only canonical New Testament scriptures by Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria, in his Easter letter of A.D. 367. If the Latin Church finally accepted twenty-seven books as the canonical New Testament by the fifth century, the Greek Church apparently was not thoroughly convinced about the canonicity of one book, Revelation, until about the tenth century. The Syrian Church witnessed to an even more complicated debate over the canon of the New Testament; for many east Syrians today the"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Peshitta is the canon and it contains only twenty-two documents, excluding 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, Jude, and Revelation. Moreover, the assumption that all Christians have the same canon is further shattered by the recognition that the Copts and Ethiopians have added other documents to the canon. Even in America today there are different canons among the various Christian communions: for example, Protestants exclude from the canon the Apocrypha, the additional books in the Greek Old Testament; the Roman Catholics, following the edicts of the Council of Trent in 1546, include them as deuterocanonical. The Mormons, moreover, argue that more books belong in the canon, and that it should remain open. Most Jews throughout the world acknowledge only the Old Testament as canonical (cf. e.g. 4Ezra 14:37-48). The Falashas, Ethiopian Jews probably dependent on Ethiopian Christianity, however, have an expanded canon, including various apocrypha and pseudepigrapha, especially the Prayer of Manasseh, Jubilees, 1 Enoch, 3 and 4 Ezra. For our present purposes it is wise to add to the above insights the recognition that many authors of pseudepigrapha believed they were recording God's infallible words. Early communities, both Jewish and Christian, apparently took some pseudepigrapha very seriously. The author of Jude, in verses 14 and 15, quoted as prophecy a portion of 1 Enoch, and this passage, 1 Enoch 1:9, has now been recovered in Aramaic from one of the caves that contained the Dead Sea Scrolls. Jude probably also was dependent, in verses 9 and 10, upon a lost Jewish apocryphon about Moses. This brief overview of the historical development of the canons reveals that to call the Pseudepigrapha 44non-canonical,\" or the biblical books 4'canonical,\" can be historically inaccurate prior to A.D. 100 and the period in which most of these documents were written. These terms should be used as an expression of some later 4'orthodoxy\" with regard to a collection that is well defined regarding what belongs within and what is to be excluded from it. It is potentially misleading to use the terms 44non-canonical,\" \"canonical,\" 44heresy,\" and \"orthodoxy\" when describing either Early Judaism or Early Christianity. Definition of pseudepigrapha The technical term 4'pseudepigrapha\" has a long and distinguished history. It was used in the late second century by Serapion when he referred to the New Testament Pseudepigrapha (ta pseudepigrapha, \"with false superscription\"; cf. Eusebius, HE 6.12). It was given prominence in the early years of the eighteenth century by J. A. Fabricius, who called the first volume of his massive work Codex pseudepigraphus veteris testamenti. The nineteenth-century collection of 4'pseud­epigrapha\" was by the Roman Catholic M. L'Abbe J.-P. Migne and titled Dictionnaire des apocryphes, ou collection de tous les livres apocryphes relatifs a Vancien et au nouveau testament', this work did not use the term 4'pseudepigrapha\" because Roman Catholics consider the Apocrypha to be deuterocanonical writings and refer to the Pseudepigrapha as \"the Apocrypha.\" In the year 1900, E. Kautzsch edited the first German collection of the Pseudepigrapha, titled Die Apokryphen und Pseudepigraphen des Alien Testaments. The first, and until the present the only, English collection of the Pseudepigrapha was published in 1913 by the Clarendon Press of Oxford, England, and edited by R. H. Charles; he included in"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"his large two-volume work both The Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha of the Old Testament. The importance of the Pseudepigrapha in the international community at the present time is evidenced by the preparation of translations into Danish, Italian, French, German, modern Greek, Japanese, Dutch, and Spanish. It is appropriate at this point to clarify the meaning of the term 4 'pseudepigrapha.'' Several definitions are current. Webster's Third New International Dictionary (p. 1830) defines the term as denoting \"spurious works purporting to emanate from biblical characters.\" That definition is misleading; ancient writings are dismissed subjectively as illegitimate. The Random House Dictionary of the English Language (the Unabridged Edition, p. 1159) offers the following: \"Certain writings (other than the canonical books and the Apocrypha) professing to be Biblical in character, but not considered canonical or inspired.\" Three reactions appear to this definition: First, it would have been informative to clarify for whom the writings are \"not considered canonical or inspired.\" Second, it is good to see a recognition of the claim to be \"Biblical in character,\" which I believe is implied by some pseudepigrapha of the Old Testament. Third, it is unfortunate that neither of the two definitions presented by these authoritative volumes recognizes that this term is also employed for documents not related to the Bible. Scholars have used the term, for example, to denote some rabbinic writings, referring to the Othijoth de Rabbi 'Akiba and the Pirfce de Rabbi Eliezer as rabbinic pseudepigrapha; moreover, \"pseudepigrapha\" is a technical term for some writings by the post-Platonic Pythagoreans. Strictly speaking, the term \"pseudepigrapha\" has evolved from pseudepigrapha, a transliteration of a Greek plural noun that denotes writings \"with false super­scription.\" The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, the title of this collection, etymologically denotes writings falsely attributed to ideal figures featured in the Old Testament. Contemporary scholars employ the term \"pseudepigrapha\" not because it denotes something spurious about the documents collected under that title, but because the term has been inherited and is now used internationally. In entitling the volume The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, I have had to take a stance on the definition of \"pseudepigrapha\" as illustrated by the selection of works other than those included by Charles. Only two works from Charles's volume of seventeen documents are not included: Pirke Aboth and \"The Fragments of a Zadokite Work,\" the former because it is rabbinic and the latter because it is now recognized to belong among the Dead Sea Scrolls. The following collection of fifty-two writings together with a long Supplement has evolved from the consensus that the Pseudepigrapha must be defined broadly so as to include all documents that conceivably belong to the Old Testament Pseudepigrapha. The present description of the Pseudepigrapha is as follows: Those writings 1) that, with the exception of Ahiqar, are Jewish or Christian; 2) that are often attributed to ideal figures in Israel's past; 3) that customarily claim to contain God's word or message; 4) that frequently build upon ideas and narratives present in the Old Testament; 5) and that almost always were composed either during the period 200 B.C. to A.D. 200 or, though late, apparently preserve, albeit in an edited form, Jewish traditions that date from that period. Obviously, the numerous qualifications (e.g. \"with the exception of,\" \"often,\" \"customarily,\" \"frequently,\" \"almost always\") warn that the above comments do not define the term \"pseudepigrapha\"; they merely describe the features of this collection."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Writings cognate to the Pseudepigrapha Including fifty-two documents plus a Supplement in the present collection of the Pseudepigrapha meant excluding other writings, although they may have some characteristics of the Pseudepigrapha. These writings were usually omitted because they were far removed from the Old Testament in date and character. Most notable among them are the following: The Vision of Daniel, The Death of Abraham (both ed. by A. Vassiliev in Anecdota Graeco-Byzantina, vol. 1. Moscow, 1893), the Hebrew Apocalypse of Elijah (ed. and trans. M. Buttenwieser, Die hebrdische Ellas-Apokalypse. Leipzig, 1897), the Book of Jasher (ed. J. Hive, The Book of Jasher. Bristol, 1829), the Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan (ed. A. Dillmann, Das christliche Adambuch des Orients. Gottingen, 1853; ET: S. C. Malan, The Book of Adam and Eve. London, 1882), the Cave of Treasures (ed. C. Bezold, Die Schatzhohle: Syrisch und Deutsch, 2 vols. Leipzig, 1883, 1888; ET: E. A. W. Budge, The Book of the Cave of Treasures. London, 1927), the Book of the Rolls (cf. M. D. Gibson, Apocrypha Arabica. Studia Sinaitica 8. London, 1901), the Sin of Solomon (unpublished, probably a homily, cf. Cod. Par. Gr. 1021, fols. 184v-185v in the Bibliotheque Nationale), Pirhe de Rabbi Eliezer (trans. G. Friedlander, Pirfce de Rabbi Eliezer. New York, 19814), the Syriac Apocalypse of Ezra (ed. and trans. J.-B. Chabot, 4 4 L'Apocalypse d'Esdras,\" Revue semitique 2 [1894] 242-50, 333-46), the Book of the Bee (ed. and trans. E. A. W. Budge, The Book of the Bee. Anecdota Oxoniensia, Sem. Ser. 1.2. Oxford, 1886), and the Questions Addressed by the Queen (of Sheba), and Answers Given by Solomon (trans. J. Issaverdens, The Uncanonical Writings of the Old Testament. Venice, 1901). Later documents related to the Pseudepigrapha have been edited in important collections; most important are those from Armenian by Jacques Issaverdens, from Ethiopic by Wolf Leslau, and from rabbinic Hebrew by Adolph Jellinek (cf. the German translation by A. Wunsche). Recently Father Martin McNamara in The Apocrypha in the Irish Church (Dublin, 1975) drew attention to 4'probably the richest crop of apocrypha in any of the European vernaculars, possibly in any vernacular language\" (p. 2). While some of the documents mentioned above may prove to be ancient or preserve portions of early Jewish pseudepigrapha, the following ten collections of ancient Jewish or early Christian writings are recognized as important for under­standing the period in which the Pseudepigrapha were composed. First and second are the works of the Jewish philosopher and exegete Philo of Alexandria (c. 20 B.C.-A.D. 50) and the Jewish historian Josephus (c. A.D. 37-C. 100); these are essential reading for an understanding of first-century Jewish life and thought. Third are the Dead Sea Scrolls, which are Jewish sectarian documents first found in 1947 in caves to the west of the Dead Sea; these inform us of the apocalyptic and eschatological ideas and of the surprising interpretations of the Old Testament by one sect of Jews, which flourished from the second century B.C. (c. 150 B.C.) to the first century A.D. (viz. A.D. 68). These scrolls are extremely important for an understanding of many pseudepigrapha, especially Jubilees, the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, 1 Enoch, and the Odes of Solomon. Fourth are the rabbinic writings, and there can be no doubt that some of the traditions recorded in these"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"documents predate the destruction of the Temple in A.D. 70; these early traditions are helpful in understanding the daily life of the religious Jew before the destruction of the nation and the Temple. Fifth are the targums, which are Aramaic translations and expansive interpretations of the Hebrew scriptures; these sometimes seem to preserve important evidence of an ancient understanding of the Old Testament. Since a Targum of Job, dating from the first half of the first century A.D., was found at Qumran, it is now clear that the earliest traditions in the other, but much later, targums must be included in an assessment of early Judaism. Sixth are the \"Jewish\" magical papyri, especially those edited by K. L. Preisendanz; these should not be ignored, as should become evident from a careful reading of some pseudepigrapha, especially the Prayer of Jacob, the Prayer of Joseph, and the History of Joseph. Seventh are the Hermetica, which are writings of the first few centuries A.D. attributed to Hermes that describe the means to personal salvation; these may contain (although I personally am not convinced) some early Jewish traditions that are important for an understanding of Early Judaism and earliest Christianity. Eighth are the Nag Hammadi codices; these Coptic codices were composed from perhaps the first to the fourth centuries A.D., but were not found until 1945 in Upper Egypt. These writings, most of which are gnostic, are intermittently influenced by early Jewish traditions. Of special importance among these codices is the Apocalypse of Adam included below. Ninth are the New Testament Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha, which contain many early Christian writings that are usually legendary expansions of the New Testament itself; these only infrequently were shaped by early Jewish traditions. Tenth are the Apocrypha, which are writings that like many pseudepigrapha are usually related to the Hebrew scriptures; as indicated earlier, the Apocrypha are documents preserved in the Greek, but not in the Hebrew, Old Testament. These documents are often designated by Roman Catholics as \"deuterocanonical,\" but most scholars have now accepted the Protestant terminology and call them \"Apocrypha.\" Different collections of the Apocrypha are available today. In order to harmonize with the contemporary, enlarged concept of Pseudepigrapha the Apocrypha should include only the additional writings preserved in almost all Septuagint manuscripts, and not the additional documents in the Vulgate (see PMR, p. 19). The Apocrypha, therefore, includes thirteen documents: 2 Ezra (= 1 Esdras),* Tobit, Judith, Additions to Esther, Wisdom of Solomon, Sirach, 1 Baruch, Letter of Jeremiah, Prayer of Azariah with the Song of the Three Young Men, Susanna, Bel and the Dragon, 1 Maccabees, and 2 Maccabees. Often two pseudepigrapha, 4 Ezra (= 2 Esdras)* and the Prayer of Manasseh,* are considered part of the Apocrypha. The thirteen documents in the Apocrypha, with the exception of Tobit, which may be much earlier, date from the last two centuries before the common era. These documents may be found in Protestant ecumenical Bibles that contain the Apocrypha in a center section between the testaments, or at the end of the two testaments. All except the three marked with asterisks will be found in Roman Catholic Bibles interspersed among the Old Testament writings or even as part of them (esp. Esth and Dan). It is important to draw attention to these other significant collections of early Jewish and Christian documents. Along with them, the Pseudepigrapha preserve ideas essential for an understanding of Early Judaism and Early Christianity."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Importance of the Pseudepigrapha We may now assess briefly the importance of the Pseudepigrapha for a better understanding of the history and thought of Jews during the centuries that preceded and followed the beginning of the common era. Four aspects of that period are impressive. First, there is the very abundance of the literature, although we possess only part of the writings produced by Jews during the period 200 B.C. to A.D. 200. We know many works are lost since early Christians quoted from and referred to documents now lost, since some writings are available only in truncated manuscripts or in fragments, since there are references to lost volumes produced, for example, by Jason of Cyrene, Justus of Tiberias, and Nicolaus of Damascus, and since each new discovery of a manuscript reminds us that there are still more works to be recovered. It is obvious that post-exilic Judaism was distinguished by voluminous and varied literature: from the production of epics or tragedies in hexameters or iambic trimeters (viz. PhEPoet, EzekTrag) to philosophical tractates (viz. Aristob, Philo, 4Mac), from perhaps reliable histories (viz. IMac, some of Josephus' publications) to imaginative recreations of the past (viz. the Chronicler, 3Mac, JosAsen), from apocalyptic dreams and visions of another world (viz. lEn, 2Bar; cf. HistRech) to humanistic wisdom (viz. Sir, Ps-Phoc), and even from charges against God in seemingly Promethean arrogance (viz. Eccl; cf. ApSedr) to hymnic and introspective submissions to God as the sole means of righteousness and salvation (viz. 1QH, PrMan; cf. OdesSol). During the post-exilic period, the Jewish genius exploded into creative new writings. Second, the Pseudepigrapha illustrate the pervasive influence of the Old Testament books upon Early Judaism. That is seen not only in the following group of works designated \"Expansions of the Old Testament,\" but also in many similar ones, especially in the selection of 44apocalypses\" and 4'testaments.\" Judaism became for all time a religion of the Book, God's eternal message. Third, we learn from the Pseudepigrapha that the consecutive conquests of Palestinian Jews by Persians, Greeks, and Romans, and the intermittent invasions by Syrian, Egyptian, and Parthian armies did not dampen the enthusiasm of religious Jews for their ancestral traditions. The ancient Davidic Psalter was constantly expanded until some collections included 155 psalms. Other psalmbooks appeared, especially the Psalms of Solomon, the Hodayoth, the Odes of Solomon, and perhaps the Hellenistic Synagogal Hymns. Apocalypses that stressed the grandeur and transcendence of God were customarily interspersed with hymns that celebrated God's nearness, and by prayers that were perceived as heard and answered. Post-exilic Judaism was a living and devout religion. New hymns, psalms, and odes witness to the fact that persecution could not choke the blessings by the faithful. Fourth, the Pseudepigrapha attest that post-exilic Jews often were torn within by divisions and sects, and intermittently conquered from without by foreign nations who insulted, abused, and frequently employed fatal torture. Persecutions inflamed the desire to revolt and some pseudepigrapha mirror the tensions among the Jews. Especially noteworthy are the Psalms of Solomon and the Testament of Moses, which record the idea that God alone is the source of power; it is he who"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"will initiate action against the gentiles and purge Jerusalem of the foreigners. The apocalypses usually are pessimistic about the present: God had withdrawn from the arena of history and from the earth; he would return only to consummate the end and to inaugurate the new. Thereby the apocalyptists affirm the loyalty of God to covenant, invite the reader to live in terms of, indeed within, another world, and envisage an optimistic conclusion for Israel in God's completed story. The Pseudepigrapha, therefore, are an important source for understanding the social dimensions of Early Judaism. The simplistic picture of Early Judaism should be recast; it certainly was neither a religion which had fallen into arduous legalism due to the crippling demands of the Law, nor was it characterized by four dominant sects. A new picture has been emerging because of ideas preserved in the documents collected below. Three examples suffice to demonstrate this insight: First, none of the present translators strives to identify a document with a particular Jewish sect. We cannot identify with certainty any author of a pseudepigraphon as being a Pharisee or an Essene or a member of another sect. Second, Palestinian Jews were influenced by Egyptian, Persian, and Greek ideas. Hence, the old distinction between 4 'Palestinian Judaism'' and * 'Hellenistic Judaism'' must be either redefined or discarded. Third, because of the variegated, even contradictory, nature of the ideas popular in many sectors of post-exilic Judaism, it is obvious that Judaism was not monolithically structured or shaped by a central and all-powerful \"ortho­doxy.\" When Charles published his edition of the Pseudepigrapha, it was widely held that Early Judaism was shaped and characterized by \"normative Judaism\" or a ruling orthodoxy centered in Jerusalem. This idea is no longer defended by most biblical scholars. Since 1947, when the first of the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered, there has even been a tendency to emphasize unduly the diversity in Early Judaism. While it is now recognized that foreign ideas penetrated deep into many aspects of Jewish thought, and that sometimes it is difficult to decide whether an early document is essentially Jewish or Christian, it is, nevertheless, unwise to exaggerate the diversity in Early Judaism. In the first century Judaism was neither uniformly normative nor chaotically diverse. The above discussion leads to the following observations that should be emphasized. The documents contained herein certainly demonstrate the rich vitality and diversity of Judaism during the early centuries. This is not the place to attempt to articulate further what, if anything, seems to unify them. Certainly confirmed is Charles's own statement that was controversial in his time: Without the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha (and we would add other documents recovered since his time, notably the Dead Sea Scrolls) \"it is absolutely impossible to explain the course of religious development between 200 B.C. and A.D. 100\" (APOT, vol. 1, p. x). Significant theological conceptions The general reader will find it helpful, when reading the documents collected below, to learn that at least four significant theological concerns are frequently found in the Pseudepigrapha: preoccupations with the meaning of sin, the origins of evil, and the problem of theodicy; stresses upon God's transcendence; concerns with the coming of the Messiah; and beliefs in a resurrection that are often accompanied with descriptions of Paradise. Each of these interests was developed—"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"at least partly—from ideas and beliefs found in the Old Testament. At the beginning it is prudent to emphasize that scholars' understanding of early Jewish theology has evolved from decades of research not only upon the Pseudepigrapha, but also upon the Old Testament, the Apocrypha, early rabbinics, Philo, Josephus, and the Dead Sea Scrolls. Sin, Evil, and the Problem of Theodicy. The Jews who returned to Palestine following the sixth-century B.C. exile in Babylon attempted to be faithful to the covenant; they rebuilt the Temple and emphasized the study of the Torah. Dedication to purity involved not only heightened rules for worship and daily life but also racial purity and separation from the heathen. Despite renewed dedication and faithfulness, the righteous did not prosper and live in a holy land free from domination. It was the sinners and the unfaithful who seemed to be rewarded, and the land—indeed the land promised to Abraham as an inheritance—was ruled by foreign oppressors. Sin and injustice were rewarded; evil appeared to be the ruling power in a world created by God. Raised repeatedly was the question: \"How could the God of Israel be holy, just, and all-powerful, and at the same time permit evil forces to oppress the righteous?\" Many pseudepigrapha are shaped by this question and the problem of theodicy (see especially 4Ezra, 2Bar, ApAbr, 3Bar). This problem evoked mutually exclusive reactions in Judaism. Qoheleth con­cluded, \"Vanity of vanities. All is vanity!\" (Eccl 1:2). Authors of some pseudepigrapha, basing their insight upon the story of Adam and Eve's first sin, described in Genesis 3, took the position that evil was dominant in the world because of Eve's sin. The author of the Life of Adam and Eve 18:1, as the author of Sirach 25:24 (in the Apocrypha), put the blame squarely upon Eve. The source of the guilt shifts completely from Eve to Adam in 4 Ezra. Evil reigns in the world certainly not because of God's actions, but because of Adam, who \"transgressed\" and was overcome, and not only he himself but all who descend from him (4Ezra 3:20f.; cf. 7:118). About the same time as 4 Ezra, the author of 2 Baruch argued that sin is in the world and continues to be a power because each individual chooses to sin (2Bar 54:15, 19; cf. lEn 98:4f.). An appreciably different explanation for the origin of sin is found emphasized in numerous pseudepigrapha. Taking as their starting point the story in Genesis 6 about \"the sons of God\" who married \"the daughters of men,\" the authors of some pseudepigrapha—especially the authors of 1 and 2 Enoch—claim that evil is in the world and is a powerful force because of evil angels. Four possible explanations for the fall of these angels may be discerned: 1) The angels had lusted for earth's beautiful women (lEn 6:1-16:4, 40:7, 54:6; 2En 18). 2) The angels perhaps had desired to reproduce themselves (lEn 6:2b, 7:1-3). 3) The Devil and his followers refused to worship Adam (Vita 14:3). 4) An angel and his legions desired to exalt themselves (2En 29:4f.). All these explanations, despite their significant differences, reflect the seriousness with which evil was perceived by post-exilic Jews, and all attempt to absolve God of the responsibility for evil. This balanced perspective is upset in a much later document, the Apocalypse of Sedrach (ch. 5). Evil is a dominant force in the world, despite God's will and actions. The righteous suffer primarily because of the power evil has obtained on the earth. The land of Israel has been engulfed by nations either sent by God to punish his sinful people or by foreigners ruled by evil forces or angels; hence God can both send"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"evil and allow it to continue. God's people suffer, and he tends to remove himself from a special portion of his creation. Transcendence of God. The emphasis in many pseudepigrapha that God is far from Israel contrasts markedly with earlier traditions, especially two accounts: According to Genesis 18 God encountered Abraham on the earth and by the oaks of Mamre, just north of Hebron; according to Exodus 3 the Lord God calls Moses from a burning bush on Mount Horeb, and the presence of God defines the place as \"holy ground.\" After the exile God is usually perceived as one who is above. The apocalyptists place him in the highest heaven, far removed from the earth (lEn 1:4, 71:5-11; 2En 20:5), but the prayers interspersed through the apocalypses reveal that he is not inaccessible. He has withdrawn from the world and no longer acts in its history; he will, however, act again, probably through intermediaries (PssSol 17, TLevi 18, TJud 24, 4Ezra 7, 2Bar 72f.). Most pseudepigrapha, in contrast to earlier Jewish writings, are characterized by an increasing claim that God is thoroughly majestic and transcendent (2Mac 3:39; 3Mac 2:15; SibOr 3.1, 11, 81, 807; 5.298, 352; Martls 1:6b; lEn 71:5-11; 2En 20:5). Knowledge of him is obtained almost always only through the sacred books, the descent of angels (TAb 2:15), the gift of vision (lEn 1:2), or the journey of a seer through the various heavens (2En, Ascenls). The contrast of these ideas with earlier ones is demonstrated by the way the author of the Testament of Abraham rewrites Genesis 18: God does not descend to visit Abraham; he sends his angel Michael to speak with the patriarch (TAb 1; cf. 16). The contrast between ideas or tendencies in early documents, such as Genesis, and those in the Pseudepigrapha should not be exaggerated; and the rewriting of God's encounter with Abraham should not be interpreted to mean that religious Jews came to believe that God was absolutely extramundane, remote, and exiled. As the hymns, odes, and prayers in the apocalypses themselves demonstrate, the Jew continued to affirm efficacious and personal communion with God. With these caveats it is possible to point out that early Jews tended to emphasize God's holiness, majesty, gloriousness, and sovereignty; he was transcendent. Messianism. The belief in a Messiah—a term which here means an ideal person, probably a king or priest, who will bring in perfect peace—is not found in the Old Testament, in the Apocrypha, or in Philo and Josephus (except for allusions). The belief in a future messianic Davidic king, however, is recorded in the prophets (viz. Isa 9:2-7, 11:1-9; Jer 33:14-22; Ezek 37:24-28); and the belief in a future Messiah (or Anointed One) of Aaron and Israel (CD Text B 19.10f.; cf. 1QS 9.11) is recorded in the Dead Sea Scrolls. The term \"Messiah\" also appears in the later Targums (especially Pseudo-Jonathan [Jerusalem Targum] at Gen 49:1 and Num 24:17-24). Numerous titles were given to the expected messianic figure; but since it is difficult to be certain in which passages these are indeed titles for the Messiah, it is wise to limit this overview only to the places in the Pseudepigrapha which mention the terms \"the Messiah\" (the Heb. noun) or \"the Christ\" (the Gk. translation) or \"the Anointed One\" (which is the meaning of both the Heb. and the Gk.). Significantly, most pseudepigrapha do not contain a reference to the coming of a Messiah; and it is impossible to derive a systematic description of the functions of the Messiah from the extant references to him. Only five pseudepigrapha contain clearly Jewish traditions about the Messiah. Late in the first century B.C. the author"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"of the Psalms of Solomon yearned for the coming of the Messiah, who will \"purge Jerusalem from gentiles.\" Notably he shall perform this task \"with the word of his mouth,\" and do this not from his own initiative, but because he is God's agent and belongs to God (PssSol 17f.). Apparently late in the first century A.D.—when many of the New Testament writings were being written, especially Matthew, Luke, and John—three authors of pseudepigrapha elaborated on traditions concerning the Messiah. The author of 2 Baruch focused upon the role of the Messiah in three separate sections (chs. 29f., 39-42, 72-74). When \"all is accomplished\" the Messiah will be revealed and the righteous resurrected (2Bar 29f.). In contrast to this apparently passive role, the Messiah, according to the second section (2Bar 39-42), will act decisively, convicting and putting to death the last evil leader, and protecting God's people. The Messiah is also active in the third section (2Bar 72-74): He shall summon all the nations, sparing those who have not mistreated Israel, and slaying those who have ruled over her. In both the second and third messianic sections the Messiah appears to be described as a militant warrior who slays the gentiles by the sword (72:6). At about the same time as the author of 2 Baruch the author of 4 Ezra, in three passages (chs. 7, 11:37-12:34, 13:3-14:9), discusses the functions of the Messiah. According to the first of these (4Ezra 7), in the future age, the world to come (7:50, 8:1), the Messiah shall be revealed, bringing rejoicing for four hundred years, and eventually die (7:28f.). According to the second passage (4Ezra 11:37-12:34), the Messiah, who is depicted as \"the lion,\" will denounce, judge, and destroy the ungodly; but he shall deliver the faithful and make them joyful. According to the third section (4Ezra 13:3-14:9), the Messiah, who is \"my son\" (13:32, 37, 52; 14:9; cf. 7:28f.) and \"a man\" (13:26, 32), withstands a warring multitude and consumes them with \"a stream of fire\" that proceeds from his mouth. Perhaps roughly contemporaneously with 2 Baruch and 4 Ezra (see the intro­duction to lEn), the author of 1 Enoch 37-71 recorded his ideas about the Messiah. In contrast to his vivid depictions of \"the Son of Man,\" \"the Righteous One,\" and \"the Elect One,\" the author's two meager references to the Messiah (or \"the Anointed One\") are surprisingly brief (48:10, 52:4). No functions are attributed to the Messiah. The fifth document in the Pseudepigrapha that contains a clearly Jewish perspective on the Messiah is the late document titled 3 Enoch. Noteworthy is the portrayal of a Messiah who is son of Joseph, and a Messiah who is son of David (45:5). It is possible that one Messiah is meant; but if two Messiahs are denoted, then the Messiahs of Israel will wage war against Gog and Magog at the end of time. This war appears to end in a draw; God himself eventually enters the war and wins the last battle. Subsequently the author of 3 Enoch describes the celebration of Israel's salvation (48:10A). The possibly early date of these traditions has been raised by the discovery of similar ones in the Dead Sea Scrolls (especially 1QS, CD, 1QM). Obviously different from the above are the references to \"the Messiah\" (and derived terms) in the pseudepigrapha that appear to be Christian compositions. Observe especially the use of the term in the Odes of Solomon (9:3, 17:17, 24:1, 29:6, 39:11, 41:3, 41:15), the Apocalypse of Zephaniah (10:24-12:32), the"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Apocalypse of Elijah (13:15-15:14, 25:8-19), and the Apocalypse of Sedrach (ch. 12). Lengthy Christian additions in the Vision of Isaiah (9:12-13, 30:7-15) and the Testament of Adam (Rec. 2) also contain significant references to \"the Anointed One\" or \"the Christ.\" Resurrection and Paradise. Scholars generally agree that the Old Testament writings, with the possible exception of Isaiah 26 and Daniel 12, do not contain explicit references to the resurrection of the dead. At death the individual simply is gathered to his final (or father's) place, the tomb. Sheol and the netherworld ('ere$) is described as the abode of the dead, not of people who continue to live after death (cf. Isa 38:18, Sir 17:28, 14:12-19). Only through his reputation or a son does his life continue on the earth. In contrast to this perception are the ideas developed in post-exilic Judaism. Some books in the Apocrypha contain numerous explicit references to the resurrection of the dead (see especially 2Mac 7, 14), or possibly even to the immortality of the soul (WisSol), and the Dead Sea Scrolls preserve ambiguous sections possibly referring to an afterlife (see especially 1QH 5.34, 6.29L, 11.10-14). Some pseudepigrapha, even more than these other documents, contain many passages that with pellucid clarity express the belief in a resurrection after death (viz. TJob, PssSol, 4Mac, Ps-Phoc, 2En, HistRech). The author of 2 Baruch, moreover, devotes a section, 49-52, to the description of the resurrected body. Logically subsequent to the development of this idea is the attempt to describe the future place of rest for the righteous. Hence, picturesque images of Paradise appear in many pseudepigrapha. The various pictoral descriptions are characterized by mutually exclusive ideas. Paradise is placed sometimes in the third heaven (2En 8A, ApMos 37:5, 40:1), and sometimes on the earth (lEn 32; 2En 8:1-6A, 30:1A; ApMos 38:5). It is depicted as either without inhabitants (lEn 32, 2En 8f., 4Ezra 8:52) or with inhabitants (PssSol 14, 2En 42:3B, ApAb 21, OdesSol 11:16-24; cf. HistRech). It is portrayed as both an eternal inheritance (PssSol 14:3f.; 2En 65:10A; OdesSol ll:16d, 16f.; 4Ezra 8:52) and a state preceding the end (ApMos 37:5, 40:1-41:3; Vita 48:6f.; Ascenls 9; cf. HistRech 13-15). There are some common beliefs, notably that Paradise is full of fruitful trees (see 2En 8A, OdesSol 11:11-16, 23) and distinguished by a sweet-smelling odor (viz. see lEn 32:3, 2En 8A, OdesSol 11:15, 2En 23:18). The contradicting ideas should not be explained away or forced into an artificial system. Such ideas in the Pseudepigrapha witness to the fact that Early Judaism was not a speculative philosophical movement or theological system, even though the Jews demonstrated impressive speculative fecundity. The Pseudepigrapha mirror a living religion in which the attempt was made to come to terms with the dynamic phenomena of history and experience. These are only four of the theological characteristics of the Pseudepigrapha, namely the problems of sin and theodicy, emphasis upon God's transcendence, speculations about the Messiah, and the ideas concerning the afterlife. Many other theological features could also be highlighted. The choice between a lunar and a solar calendar (see Jub and lEn) produced major upheavals in Judaism in the second century B.C. Calendrical issues contained cosmic and profound theological dimensions. How exasperating to discover you were not observing the Sabbath on the correct day and with the angels and the rest of the universe. How astounding to learn that Passover was celebrated at the wrong time. Similarly, the search for"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"authority and reliable insight into God's will is reflected in the search for the quintessence of Torah and its text. The search for God himself and the tendency toward belief in a transcendent and apparently aloof Creator spawned complex angelologies. The impossibility of obtaining satisfactory meaning in present history helped produce the theological perspectives behind apocalypticism. Conclusion These introductory comments are far too brief to constitute an introduction to the Pseudepigrapha, and they should not be taken to indicate that scholars have arrived at anything like a consensus on the major issues. These few comments should, however, enable the general reader to understand better the documents collected below; at least they reflect how the editor perceives them. Each of the Pseudepigrapha is preceded by an introduction (see Editor's Preface) and organized under categories which also have brief introductions. These collectively serve to help the reader appreciate the documents themselves."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"EXPLANATION OF TYPOGRAPHICAL AND REFERENCE SYSTEMS Chapter and verse numbers We have endeavored to present the documents below in a format similar to that of the Jerusalem Bible. Hence, chapters and verses are supplied. A new chapter is indicated by a large bold numeral. Verse numbers are placed in the margin in ordinary roman type; in the text itself, the beginning of each verse is marked by a • which precedes the first word of the verse except when the verse begins a new line or a new chapter. Because of their linguistic nature, some documents—such as the Sibylline Oracles, Letter of Aristeas, and Syriac Menander—are not divided into chapters and verses. These are presented so that the beginning of each line or section of text is noted in the margin with numbers in ordinary roman type as with verse numbers. Italics in the text Italic type in the text denotes full or partial quotations of the Bible. The biblical passage from which the quotation is derived is noted in the margin. Brackets and other sigla in the translation [ ] Square brackets denote restorations. ( ) Pointed brackets signify corrections to a text. ( ) Parentheses circumscribe words added by the translator. Ancient languages are cryptic; verbs, nouns, and pronouns are often omitted. These are, of course, necessary for idiomatic English and are presented within parentheses. | | This siglum indicates a letter incorrectly omitted by an ancient scribe. { } Braces denote unnecessary words or letters in an ancient text. Footnotes In each chapter, footnotes are lettered alphabetically. The footnotes are not intended to be a mini-commentary, but to supply significant information, such as important related thoughts contained in ancient writings not considered either canonical or extracanonical. Only significant variants in the manuscripts are cited. These notes assume that the reader has read the general introduction and the introduction to each document being footnoted."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"EXPLANATION OF TYPOGRAPHICAL AND REFERENCE SYSTEMS xxxvi Punctuation of biblical references Chapter and verse are separated by a colon, e.g. Ex 20:7. A subsequent verse in the same chapter is separated from the preceding by a comma. Subsequent citations in other biblical or apocryphal writings are separated by semicolons: e.g. Ex 20:17, 20; Lev 9:15. Citations which are not preceded by an abbreviation refer to the respective passage in a document being footnoted. Marginal references Marginal references are kept to a minimum and except in rare occasions are limited to significant parallels in biblical and apocryphal writings. These marginal references should help the reader better understand the relevant passage by drawing attention to the source of a biblical quotation, and to other uses of special terms, phrases, or images. The references in the margin often occur in groups all relating to one text line; in such cases, the position of the first reference indicates the line to which the whole group applies. Marginal references not preceded by the abbreviation of a book indicate a passage elsewhere in the document before the reader. Care has been taken to assure that each marginal reference begins on the line to which it refers. However, in some cases this is not possible because of the length of necessary marginal references. In these cases, the marginal reference is preceded by a verse reference (i.e. the letter v plus the number of the verse) so the reader can attach the marginal references to the correct verses. Secondary divisions within the document The manuscripts from which the translators have worked usually do not separate the text so that each new thought or development in the narrative is indicated. The translators have supplied the subdivisions to help the reader follow the flow of the document."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS I.

H. CHARLESWORTH Apocalyptic—from the Greek word apokalupsis meaning * 'revelation'' or \"disclo­sure\"—is an adjective that has been used to describe both a certain type of literature and a special feature of religions in late antiquity. Unfortunately there is presently no consensus regarding the precise definition of this adjective; confusion sometimes arises because it is employed frequently in contradictory ways. Some scholars have argued that \"apocalyptic\" denotes a specific type of revelatory literature that has a narrative structure and unique characteristics, such as pseudonymity, bizarre images, and visions of the end of time or of the numerous heavens; according to them apocalyptic literature tends to represent a well-defined literary genre. Other scholars—more impressed by the different features of the documents that are \"apocalypses\"—have claimed that \"apocalyptic\" does not denote a specific genre but a religious bearing that is preoccupied by the approach of the end of all normal time and history. Some specialists have written about apocalyptic religion as if it were a movement. The dissimilarities and contradictions among the apocalyptic writings—especially the different attitudes toward revolution and the contrasting descriptions of the various heavens and Paradise—should caution us against perceiving late biblical religion as if it were a coherent uniform movement. The Old Testament contains only one apocalypse: the Book of Daniel. The New Testament adds only one more: the Book of Revelation. These writings were selected from numerous apocalypses that were popular during the time when the canons of the Old Testament and New Testament were still open. Both of the canons, moreover, contain important apocalyptic sections (viz. Ezek 40-48; Isa 24-27, 34f., 56-66; Zech 9-14; Mk 13 and par., IThes 4; ICor 15). The present edition of the Pseudepigrapha includes nineteen documents that are apocalypses or related documents. In the past, the definition of \"apocalyptic\" was derived from a study of only some of the extant apocalypses, especially \"the Apocalypse,\" the Book of Revelation. It will be easier now to perceive more adequately the richness of apocalyptic literature and the extent of early Jewish and Christian apocalyptic ideas and apocalyptic religion. The possible importance of apocalyptic Judaism to earliest Christianity is demonstrated by the claim by some New Testament specialists and Christian theologians that apocalyptic Judaism was the mother of all Christian theology. In assessing the nature and importance of the apocalypses translated below, the reader should examine also other pseudepigrapha that contain apocalyptic sections, especially the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, the Testament of Abraham, the"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 4 Testament of Moses, Jubilees, the Martyrdom and Ascension of Isaiah, and 4 Baruch. It is important also to consult the Dead Sea Scrolls, many of which are apocalyptic writings, and the apocalypses and apocalyptically inspired writings in the New Testament Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha. A final caveat seems necessary. The presence of the term \"apocalypse\" in the title of a document does not qualify it immediately as an apocalypse; likewise the absence of such a term does not exclude it from being an apocalypse. Sometimes these titles were added by individuals far removed chronologically and geograph­ically from the authors, and some pseudepigrapha bear discrepant titles; for example, the History of the Rechabites in some writings is titled the Testament of Zosimus, in others the Apocalypse of Zosimus; the Life of Adam and Eve is essentially the same as the Apocalypse of Moses (an inapt title for the story of Adam and Eve).

A NEW TRANSLATION AND INTRODUCTION BY E. ISAAC The Ethiopic Book of Enoch (Henok), also known as 1 Enoch, is the oldest of the three pseudepigrapha attributed to Enoch, the seventh descendant of Adam and Eve, the first man and woman. According to Genesis 5:24, \"Enoch walked with God. Then he vanished because God took him.\" This tradition of Enoch's spiritual relocation gave rise to many haggadic stories, including one that Enoch, son of Jared, when he was taken away by God, saw the secrets of the mysteries of the universe, the future of the world, and the predetermined course of human history.1 The first part of the book contains an introduction (chs. 1-5), which portrays the escha-tological era and the final judgment of the righteous and the wicked, and a narrative (chs. 6-36) which concerns the fallen angels, their intercourse with women (Gen 6:1-4), their corruption of all men, Enoch's unsuccessful intercession on their behalf, a prediction of their doom, and various visions of Enoch during a tour of the earth, Sheol, and heaven. The second part—the Similitudes, or the so-called \"parables\" (chs. 37-71)—deals respectively with the coming judgment of the righteous and the wicked; the Messiah, the Son of Man, the Righteous One, and the Elect One; the exposition of additional heavenly secrets; the measuring of Paradise; the resurrection of the righteous; and the punishment of the fallen angels. The third part, an astrological treatise (chs. 72-82), concerns the reckoning of time by the sun, the nature of the solar year of 364 days, and the cosmic disorders of the last days. The fourth part, the Dream Visions (chs. 83-90), consists of two visions concerning the future history (from Enoch's antediluvian perspective) of the world and Israel: the coming punishment of sinful society by the Deluge, and the history of Israel from Adam to the Maccabeans presented with bold symbolic imagery. Oxen symbolize the patriarchs; sheep, the faithful Israelites; beasts and birds of prey, the heathen oppressors of Israel; a great horned sheep, a rising Jewish leader; a white bull with great horns, the Messiah. There is also additional material on the fallen angels, the throne of judgment, and the new Jerusalem, together with Enoch's experience of his earlier visions. The fifth part (chs. 91-104), Enoch's testament, recapitulates the theme of the spiritual blessedness of the righteous and the sorrowful end of the sinners. Woes are pronounced upon the sinners, who are repeatedly identified with the exploitative wealthy and oppressive powers. This section, known partic­ularly for its inclusion of the Apocalypse of Weeks (91:12-17 and 93:1-10), summarizes the events that would unfold upon the earth during ten (actually seven and three respectively) consecutive world weeks. An appendix (chs. 105-8) contains fragments of independent works, especially from the Book of Noah (chs. 106f.), and an editor's conclusion. 1 For other synopses of the narrative, see M. Rist, \"Enoch, Book of,\" IDB, vol. 2, pp. 104f.; R. H. Charles, The Book of Enoch, pp. 22f.; R. H. Charles, Religious Development Between the Old and the New Testaments (New York, 1914) pp. 223-26.

Charlesworth for his improvements to the Introduction.]"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Texts 1 Enoch is found complete only in the Ethiopic (Ge'ez) Version, for which more than forty manuscripts are known to exist as of this writing. However, fragments of the work are also found in Aramaic, Greek, and Latin. 1. Aramaic: Aramaic fragments of 1 Enoch were found at Qumran and have been recently published, together with a major study of the text and history of 1 Enoch.2 2. Ethiopic: As has been indicated above, the complete version of 1 Enoch is preserved only in Ethiopic. Below are a list of five major and important manuscripts, one of which (A) has been utilized as the base text of the present English translation, and another of which (C) has been used very extensively in the same work: A. Kebran 9/II (Hammerschmidt—Tdnasee 9/II); fifteenth century.3 B. Princeton Ethiopic 3 (Garrett collection—Isaac 3); eighteenth or nineteenth century.4 C. EMML 2080; fifteenth (possibly 14th) century.5 D. Abbadianus 55; possibly fifteenth century.6 E. British Museum Orient 485 (Wright 6); first half of the sixteenth century.7 3. Greek: The Greek fragments are found principally in the following: a. Codex Panopolitanus (two 8th-cent. or later MSS, found in 1886-87 in a Christian grave in Akhmim, Egypt), containing 1 Enoch 1:1-32:6 (designated Ga in this work). b. Chronographia of Georgius Syncellus (c. 800), containing 1 Enoch 6:1-10:14; 15:8-16:1 (designated Gs in this work). c. Chester Beatty papyrus of 1 Enoch containing 97:6-104; 106f. (published by C. Bonner, The Last Chapters of Enoch in Greek) (designated Gp in this work). d. Vatican Greek MS 1809, containing 1 Enoch 89:42-49. 4. Latin: a Latin fragment, containing 1 Enoch 106:1-18, found in an eighth-century manuscript.8 Original language Some scholars believe that the original language of 1 Enoch is Hebrew; others, however, think it is Aramaic; still others contend that the book, like Daniel, was composed partly in Hebrew and partly in Aramaic.9 Recently there have been attempts either to counter10 or to substantiate entirely11 the Aramaic origin of the Ethiopic text. Neither theory provides wholly convincing arguments which may be accepted without reservations. Our text of A shows an additional closeness between the Ethiopic and Greek versions, but not sufficient to rule out the possibility that a major portion of the Ethiopic text of 1 Enoch was of Aramaic origin. Moreover, HalSvy's argument that portions of the Ethiopic text derive ultimately from a Hebrew original has not been disproved. Consequently, the thesis that part of 1 Enoch, like the canonical Daniel, was composed partially in Aramaic and partially in Hebrew has to be considered probable.

Introductory Chapters  1-5  late pre-Christian The discovery of these fragments of 1 Enoch has awakened new interest in the structure and dating of 1 Enoch. Following to some extent the former views that this work is a collection of independent writings, Milik has argued for the categorization of the Ethiopic version into five primary books with the last chapter being taken as a much later addition.13 These are: 1. The Book of the Watchers (1-36) 2. The Book of the Similitudes (37-71) 3. The Book of Astronomical Writings (72-82) 4. The Book of Dream Visions (83-90) 5. The Book of the Epistle of Enoch (91-107) Milik argues for a pre-Christian Qumran Enochic Pentateuch which contained a much longer version of the astrological writings, and, most importantly, instead of the Similitudes, another work entitled the Book of Giants.14 He bases his argument on the fact that fragments of only four of the five constituent parts of the Ethiopic Enoch have been discovered at Qumran. No fragment from the Similitudes has been recovered. Milik argues that by the year A.D. 400 the Book of Giants as in the Qumran Aramaic Enoch had been replaced by the late Christian work, the Similitudes, in a new Greek Enochic Pentateuch. This hypothesis is not supported by any solid evidence and has been subjected to serious criticism, in particular by the members of the SNTS Pseudepigrapha Seminar which met in 1977 in Tubingen and in 1978 in Paris.15 The consensus of the members was that the Similitudes were Jewish and dated from the first century A.D. At these meetings, it was also agreed that Milik should have worked more directly with the Ethiopic evidence. Unfortunately, he took Charles's dated text and translation at face value and incorrectly assumed that all Ethiopic manuscripts of 1 Enoch are very recent, except possibly a fifteenth-century text (Charles's u—Abbadianus 55). We now have at least three definitely fifteenth-century Ethiopic manuscripts, and it seems probable that even earlier ones may be discovered. Indeed, one of the readings in the fifteenth-century manuscript used herein as a base text casts serious doubts on one of Milik's arguments for the late date of the Similitudes. Milik has argued that the reference to angels flying \"with wings\" (lEn 61:1) points to a post-Christian period for the composition of the Similitudes. Our manuscript does not support him; it has no reference to angels flying 4 4with wings\" (see translation and n. below). Milik is correct that his text of 61:1 is late; he failed to see, however, that the late part is a late variant. In conclusion, I am convinced that 1 Enoch already contained the Similitudes by the end of the first century A.D. Provenance We are not certain about the city or place in which 1 Enoch was, or its constituent parts 12 Cf. R. H. Charles, \"The Book of Enoch,\" in APOT, vol. 2, pp. 170f. 13 Cf. J. T. Milik, HTR 64 (1971) 333-78. Also see Milik, The Books of Enoch, pp. 4-135. 14 This work, believed to have been in circulation among the Manicheans, has been recovered from various fragments by W. B.

However, it is clear that the work originated in Judea and was in use at Qumran before the beginning of the Christian period. The evidence concerning the origin of the Ethiopic version of 1 Enoch is also lacking. We can be relatively certain that the version was produced in Ethiopia during the earliest period of Ethiopic literature (c. A.D. 350-650). However, this was a time of extensive translating and copying by Christian scribes in Ethiopia, and exact dates and cities are unknown. Historical importance Information regarding the usage and importance of the work in the Jewish and Christian communities, other than the Ethiopian Church, is sparse. It is difficult, therefore, to understand its exact origin. It seems clear, nonetheless, that 1 Enoch was well known to many Jews, particularly the Essenes, and early Christians, notably the author of Jude. The earliest portions of the work originated probably in a proto-Essene milieu; the latter sections perhaps in a setting quite different from Qumran Essenism. 1 Enoch reflects the historical events immediately preceding and following the Maccabean Revolt. More important, however, is the light it throws upon early Essene theology and upon earliest Christianity. It was used by the authors of Jubilees, the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, the Assumption of Moses, 2 Baruch, and 4 Ezra. Some New Testament authors seem to have been acquainted with the work, and were influenced by it, including Jude, who quotes it explicitly (l:14f.). At any rate, it is clear that Enochic concepts are found in various New Testament books, including the Gospels and Revelation. 1 Enoch played a significant role in the early Church; it was used by the authors of the Epistle of Barnabas, the Apocalypse of Peter, and a number of apologetic works. Many Church Fathers, including Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Origen, and Clement of Alexandria, either knew 1 Enoch or were inspired by it. Among those who were familiar with 1 Enoch, Tertullian had an exceptionally high regard for it. But, beginning in the fourth century, the book came to be regarded with disfavor and received negative reviews from Augustine, Hilary, and Jerome. Thereafter, with the exception of a few extracts made by Georgius Syncellus, a learned monk of the eighth century, and the Greek fragments found in a Christian grave in Egypt (c. A.D. 800), 1 Enoch ceased to be appreciated except in Ethiopia. The relegation of 1 Enoch to virtual oblivion by medieval minds should not diminish its significance for Christian origins; few other apocryphal books so indelibly marked the religious history and thought of the time of Jesus. The interest in 1 Enoch in Ethiopia began with its initial translation and has continued thereafter. During the earliest period of Ethiopic literature many biblical, apocryphal, pseudepigraphical, and distinctly Christian works were translated into Ethiopic (Ge'ez) and copied extensively by scribes. Most of these early copies probably perished during the various periods of political upheavals that took place in Ethiopia (c. A.D. 950, c. A.D. 1270, or c. A.D. 1527-43). Thus, most scholars take for granted that no manuscripts of this early period actually exist; nevertheless, it is premature to dismiss the possibility at this time. Although research in Ethiopian studies in general is quite advanced, research into manuscripts and manuscript collections found in Ethiopian monasteries and churches is still at an elementary stage. As of now, our three oldest manuscripts of 1 Enoch date from the fifteenth century. In the early seventeenth century, some European scholars thought that a version of 1 Enoch which was identical with the one quoted by Jude and early Church Fathers existed in Ethiopia. A learned Capuchin monk was believed to have brought to Europe a copy of the work, which passed into the possession of Nicolas Claude Fabri, the Seigneur of Peiresc (1580-1637). This manuscript, which aroused great excitement in Europe, drew the attention of the first great European Ethiopic scholar, Ludolfus Hiob, who traced it to the Bibliotheca Regia in Paris in 1683. He was disappointed to learn that the manuscript was not of 1 Enoch but that of an unknown Ethiopic work called the Book of the Mysteries of Heaven and Earth. It took another century before copies of 1 Enoch finally arrived in Europe. They were brought in 1773 by J. Bruce, the adventurous Scottish traveler to Africa. Nothing occurred until 1800, when Silvestre de Sacy, in his \"Notice sur le livre d'Henoch\" (in Magazine encyclopedique 6/1, p. 382), first published excerpts from the book together with Latin translations of chapters 1, 2, 5-16, and 22-32. In 1821 Lawrence issued the first English version of the work. In 1853 Dillmann published a translation which aroused much interest in the work."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Theological importance 1 Enoch helps clarify the rich complexities of both intertestamental Jewish thought and early Christian theology. In this brief introduction it is only possible to sketch a few of 1 Enoch's many ideas, motifs, symbolisms, and important theological concepts. The God of 1 Enoch is the righteous and just God of the Old Testament; he is the Creator of the world, the holy lawgiver, the dispenser of history, and the ultimate judge of all. Genesis 6:1-4 alludes to the sons of God who had intercourse with the daughters of the people. 1 Enoch transforms this idea into a theology of fallen angels, who consorted with women and produced giants who sinned against the people. They corrupted the people through the instructions in forbidden sciences like making arms, cosmetics, precious metals. Enoch's intercession on behalf of the fallen angels fails; he is instructed, on the contrary, to predict their final doom (12—16). Allusions to the legend of the fallen angels occur elsewhere in Jewish writings (viz. Jub; Sir 16:7; CD 2.14-3.13; 4Q 180f.; and rabbinic Midrashim).16 One of the extensively discussed concepts in 1 Enoch, particularly by students of New Testament theology, is that of the heavenly Messiah (45-57). The Messiah in 1 Enoch, called the Righteous One, and the Son of Man, is depicted as a pre-existent heavenly being who is resplendent and majestic, possesses all dominion, and sits on his throne of glory passing judgment upon all mortal and spiritual beings. This description of the Messiah is placed in the Similitudes in the context of reflections upon the last judgment, the coming destruction of the wicked, and the triumph of the righteous ones. This eschatological concept is the most prominent and recurring theme throughout the whole book. The very introduction (1-5) opens with an announcement of the final, coming punishment, the destruction of the wicked ones and the resurrection of the righteous ones to an endless and sinless eternal life. Likewise, in the Dream Visions (83-90) the same theme is recalled. In this case, the righteous dead, including converted gentiles, will be resurrected, the Messiah will appear, his kingdom will be founded, and the new Jerusalem established; on the other hand, the sinners, the fallen angels, including the apostate Jews, will be judged. The last major section of 1 Enoch (91-105) is an admonition to righteousness, for he predicts that the wicked shall be condemned to eternal punishment in Sheol, whereas the righteous shall have a blessed resurrection to enjoy the bliss of heaven. One of the central emphases of 1 Enoch is that sinners are economic exploiters, the political oppressors, and the socially unjust people of this world. Thus, while 1 Enoch will deepen our insights into and broaden our perspectives of intertestamental Jewish and early Christian theology, it also will help us to appreciate the revolutionary mood of Jews and their staunch opposition not only to Greek and Roman imperialism, but also to Jewish aristocracy itself. There is also a social concern behind 1 Enoch's computation of time and understanding of the calendar. Time should be reckoned only by the sun, not by the moon as in the Pharisaic lunar calendar. The author's solar year consists of 364 days, and not 365'A, a fact of which he is also aware. The calendrical discussion is tied to a spiritual concern; in the last days the sun, moon, stars, and earth will be disrupted in cosmic chaos. Relation to biblical and apocryphal books It should be evident from what has been said above that 1 Enoch is as dependent upon the Old Testament as it is influential upon the New Testament and later extracanonical literature. During the exilic and post-exilic periods, apocalyptic became a major trend in Jewish thought. It was inherited by Christianity and remains an element in it to the present. Apocalyptic is both prophetic and revelatory; in apocalyptic literature we find, on the one hand, moral indignation about the present world, and, on the other, the foreboding predictions of eschatological events and the ultimate destiny of the world. Old Testament ideas and stories such as the account of the fallen angels, the Flood, the history of Israel, the distinction between the righteous and the wicked, and the Messiah are interpreted, elaborated, and presented through the paradigm of apocalyptic dualism, wherein 16 Cf. D. Dimant, 44 'The Fallen Angels' in the Dead Sea Scrolls and in the Apocryphal and Pseudepigraphic Books Related to Them\" (Ph.D. thesis, Hebrew Univ., 1974)."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"sharp distinctions are drawn between the opposing cosmic powers of good and evil and between the present and coming ages. These concepts in 1 Enoch also permeate Jubilees, the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, the Assumption of Moses, the Testament and Apocalypse of Abraham, 2 Baruch, and 4 Ezra. Likewise, even though Charles may have exaggerated when he claimed that \"nearly all\" the writers of the New Testament were familiar with 1 Enoch, there is no doubt that the New Testament world was influenced by its language and thought. It influenced Matthew, Luke, John, Acts, Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Ephesians, Colossians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, 1 Timothy, Hebrews, 1 John, Jude (which quotes it directly), and Revelation (with numerous points of contact). There is little doubt that 1 Enoch was influential in molding New Testament doctrines concerning the nature of the Messiah, the Son of Man, the messianic kingdom, demonology, the future, resurrection, final judgment, the whole eschatological theater, and symbolism. No wonder, therefore, that the book was highly regarded by many of the earliest apostolic and Church Fathers. Cultural importance 1 Enoch, as we have seen, made an impact on early Christian thought and left its indelible mark upon the New Testament. It also contributes indirectly to our understanding of Western culture; however, inasmuch as it was altogether a lost book to the Western world until the last century, 1 Enoch played no role in, and made no contributions to, the development of the intellectual history of modern Western culture. On the other hand, it is hardly possible to understand any aspect of the religious tradition and thought of Ethiopia, the country in which it survived, without an understanding of it. No wonder that the indigenous Ethiopic Book of the Mysteries of Heaven and Earth created such a sensation in seventeenth-century Europe as being the very \"Book of Enoch\" itself. The style, the language, the symbolisms, and the concepts of the Book of Mysteries, though different in many ways from those of 1 Enoch, clearly manifest a conscious effort to emulate 1 Enoch. For instance, the fourth part of the Book of Mysteries, called \"A Discourse Concerning the Birth of Enoch,\" recapitulates the Apocalypse of Weeks, brings the last three weeks through to the Christian era, and ends with the Antichrist in the tenth.17 The Book of Mysteries is only one example of the influence of 1 Enoch on Ethiopic literature. The Kebra Nagast, the famous Ethiopian royal saga, is another example of a work that utilizes 1 Enoch generously. Other Ethiopic religious works contain references from, and show influences of, 1 Enoch. Ethiopic poetic literature, the gadles (the Ethiopic hagiographies), and some of the magical works manifest the influence of 1 Enoch in their language, imageries, angelology, and demonology. Still more significant is the influence of Enochic ideas on Ethiopian Christian theology. What distinguishes Ethiopian Christian theology from that of either Western or Eastern. Christendom may well be the Ethiopian emphases on Enochic thought. Sin does not originate from Adam's transgression alone; Satan, the demons, and evil spirits (the fallen angels) are equally responsible for its origin; they continue to lead man astray, causing moral ruin on the earth. On the other hand, there are the protective angels, with their various orders and ranks, who play an important part in both the religious and social life of the Ethiopian people; these angels—particularly Michael, Gabriel, Rufael, Uriel, as well as the cherubim (Krubel) and the seraphim (Surafel)—serve as personal guardians of those specially dedicated to them and who celebrate with meticulous observance the dates of their special festivals. Introducing the following translation My primary base text (A) for this translation of Ethiopic Enoch is a fifteenth-century Ethiopic manuscript found in a monastery in Kebran, in Lake Tana. I obtained a copy of this manuscript from a microfilm (A) now found in West Germany.18 Though I have chosen to use as my base text a single manuscript, instead of an existing eclectic text or one created temporarily as the real basis of my translation, I have continually compared A with another 17 Cf. J. Perruchon and I. Guidi, \"Le Livre des Mysteres du Ciel et de la Terre\" in Patrologia Orientalis 1/1 (1907) 1-95; and S. Grebaut, \"Les Trois Derniers Traites du Livre des Mysteres du Ciel et de la Terre,\" Patrologia Orientalis 6/3 (1911) 361-464. 18 E. Hammerschmidt, Athiopische Handschriften vom Tdnasee, p. 107."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Ethiopic manuscript of the late eighteenth century (B) found in the Garrett collection of Princeton University as well as with the text of R. H. Charles (C),'9 and, in a few cases, followed them instead of A where the latter is clearly wrong or unintelligible. I have been as faithful as possible to A, following it even when B and C and all other known witnesses, attested by the variations of other manuscripts given in the apparatus of Charles (EC), disagree with it, except in clear cases where A obviously transmits grammatical, syntactical, or scribal errors. Only the most significant or relevant variations of other witnesses are shown in my notations. If B or C are clearly erroneous (scribal, typographic, grammatical), I do not always give them as variations. Wherever possible or necessary I have also been able to compare A with the texts of the existing Greek fragments as given in the Charles edition of 1 Enoch: Ga (the fragments from Akhmim—Gal and Ga2 the duplicate passages of the same if they exist), G5 (the fragments preserved by Syncellus), and Gp (the Greek papyrus as edited by Bonner). The Qumran Aramaic fragments of 1 Enoch have been consulted but have not influenced the following translation.20 It appears to me that in general A is superior to B and C, often giving shorter and more difficult readings (see, for instance, 71:8f.). I have been able to examine briefly microfilms of three important Enoch manuscripts—EMML 2080 (15th cent.), 4437 (17th cent.), and 4750 (17th cent.)—copies of which are presently found in the Hill Monastic Microfilm Library, St. John's University, Collegeville, Minnesota, to ascertain the importance of A. Of the manuscripts that Charles studied, A appears to be closest to his g (early 16th cent.)21 and his u (possibly 15th cent.).22 But in many interesting or important cases, A may agree with other manuscripts used by Charles. For instance, A agrees with not only u but also Charles's m and t in omitting \"Son\" from the \"Son of Man\" (69:26). In at least one crucial place, A agrees with q against other witnesses. Scholars have thought that the reference to Enoch's travel in a \"chariot of wind\" as found in a Mani Codex (which relied on an Apocalypse of Enoch) is missing from the Ethiopic Enoch; if we follow A and q (cf. 52:1) this may not be wholly the case. In general A agrees with the Ethiopic textual tradition against the Greek; nevertheless, there are a few cases where it agrees with the Greek against other Ethiopic traditions (e.g. 18:9; 24:5). The importance of A is unfortunately reduced by the carelessness of the scribe (e.g. 45:1; 48:10). It is also possible that the scribe of A used two manuscripts as he worked or copied one manuscript freely; that may be the reason why fols. 103r-106v (lEn 78:8b-82:20) are a duplicate of fols. 96r-99r (or vice versa), showing each time several variations—perhaps two scribes with very similar hands copied parts of A, using separate texts. It should be noted here that my translation, though very faithful to the text, is in general not always literal. Therefore, I may render a single Ethiopic word into different English expressions depending on the context or idiom. For instance, mangest may be rendered \"kingdom\" or \"empire,\" hayl, \"power,\" \"force,\" \"forces,\" \"army,\" or \"array,\" samay, \"heaven\" or \"sky,\" and so on. In this respect, I have also translated the expression re'esa mawd'el as the \"Antecedent of Time\" or the \"Before-Time,\" instead of the literal \"Head of Days\"; on the other hand, it has not been easy to find a more adequate expression for the more or less literal \"Son of Man.\" I generally bear in mind not only the context of the language but also the context of the milieu of the languages of 1 Enoch; thus, I translate kramt \"rainy season\" rather than \"winter,\" hagay \"dry season\" rather than \"summer.\" It should also be noted that despite the freedom in Ethiopic regarding the use of the singular and the plural, both in the case of nouns and verbs, I have tried to render all Ethiopic expressions into acceptable English; moreover, except in certain cases (e.g. the sun is generally feminine, the moon, masculine), it has not always been possible to indicate the gender of Ethiopic words in the translation. A major dilemma always arises in rendering the simple but ubiquitous Ethiopic conjunction wa- into English; the reader should know that I have been very generous in using whatever connective English conjunction I felt to be appropriate in many cases (e.g. \"and,\" \"or,\" \"but,\" \"moreover,\" \"furthermore,\" \"then,\" 19 Charles, The Ethiopic Version of the Book of Enoch. 20 These are now edited by Milik, The Books of Enoch, pp. 139-407. 21 W.

In conclusion, even though I have not tried to annotate all my restorations of grammatical, scribal, and textual errors and variant readings, I have provided ample notes in order that the reader may appreciate the problems of translating this difficult work and understand better this translation. I am the last person to claim that this translation is flawless; by its nature, every translation involves a subjective dimension which may lead to errors.23 231 am thankful to Professor James Charlesworth of Duke University, who invited me to do this work, and to Professor Michael Stone, who urged me to accept the invitation.

Appendix: 2 Enoch in Merilo Pravednoe A NEW TRANSLATION AND INTRODUCTION* BY F. I. ANDERSEN This work is an amplification of Genesis 5:21-32; that is, it covers events from the life of Enoch to the onset of the Flood. The first and larger part, chapters 1-68, describes how Enoch was taken up to the Lord through the seven heavens and then returned to report to his family what he had learned. The second part, chapters 69-73, deals more briefly with the life of Enoch's successors, Methuselah and Nir, and ends with the story of the birth and ascension of Melchizedek, just prior to the Flood. The book is basically a Midrash; but the sparse plot is almost lost in the large amount of apocalyptic material that it carries. The story of Enoch and his descendants provides the setting for a loosely assembled array of quite diverse ingredients, including cosmological speculations, ethical instruction, and prophecies of the future. Besides forecasting the Flood, these predictions extend to the fate of mankind, good and bad, after death. A basis for this eschatology was provided by the visits to Paradise and to the place of torment in the heavens. Angelology, astronomy, astrology, and calendrical systems all arise from the study of creation. The whole is suffused with teaching about God which is uncompromisingly monotheistic, notwithstanding the abundant mythology. The main doctrinal point, which is reiterated throughout, is that the Lord is the sole Creator. No other activity of God is celebrated, unless it is the last judgment. There is no interest in history. The author's posture is simple. His statements are unsupported by philosophical reasoning. Idolatry is denounced in conventional terms. The ethical component is spread over the whole work, either as comments by the angels on why the occupants of heaven and hell are where they are, or as exhortations given by Enoch to his family. The cardinal virtues are care for the poor and needy, and sexual purity. Many other ideas, some quite strange, appear along the way; but the main concern is with the origin of things. While derived mainly from the biblical creation stories, the account of the cosmos has been elaborated in a quasi-scientific manner. The results are not altogether consistent; sometimes the picture is quite obscure. The most systematic description arises from the journey through the seven heavens. Then there is a distinct account of the origin of everything, presented as an extended story of the creation of the universe based on Genesis If., told by the Lord himself in the first person as autobiographical reminiscences. Some of this material is repeated when Enoch makes his report to his family on earth, in the form of lists, rather than narrative.1 * [The Introduction does not contain sections on \"Relation to Canonical Books\" or on \"Relation to Apocryphal Books,\" because of the complex textural history of this document.

Not one of them is simply a text of 2 Enoch itself; in every case the Enoch material is either part of a larger-work or part of a collection of various pieces. Only a few of them have the text in any degree of completeness; most of them supply only brief extracts incorporated into different miscellanies, usually with drastic abbreviation or extensive reorganization. Four manuscripts (N, V, B2, P) end with Enoch's second ascension. Five manuscripts (A, U, B, R, J) are more complete, since they go on to the subsequent events, including the legends of Methuselah and Melchizedek. J does not continue to the end, so that only A, U, B, R reach the rapture of Melchizedek and the Flood. The Melchizedek story is found also in Rum, which has extracted it from 2 Enoch, as the title shows. There is no evidence that the second part ever existed separately.3 Attempts have been made to classify the known manuscripts into textual families. Without critical editions of them all, this procedure is premature. A stemma of relationships is often very hard to work out in medieval manuscripts of this kind. To illustrate, M. I. Sokolov's impression that V is virtually identical with N, based on a cursory collation, has been repeated in much subsequent discussion; but it is false, and the several superior readings of V need to be included.4 The fourteenth-century copy of Merilo Pravednoe, which is the oldest of all the manuscripts, is so far the only one that has been published in facsimile. But the extracts from 2 Enoch which have been incorporated into this ethical treatise have been 2 The following abbreviations are used to refer to institutions holding MSS: BAN Library of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R., Leningrad GIM State Historical Museum, Moscow IHP Institute of History and Philology, Nezhin NLB National Library, Belgrade RM Rumyantsev Museum TSS Trinity-St. Sergius Monastery Library [The last two collections are now in the Lenin Library, Moscow] VL The Austrian National Library, Vienna The editor and translator wish to express their gratitude to the Library of the Academy of Sciences in Leningrad for photographs of the unpublished MSS A and J; and to the Vienna Library for a photograph of the unpublished MS V. 3 F. L. Horton (The Melchizedek Tradition [SNTS MS 30; Cambridge, 1976]) summarily dismisses 2En on the grounds that its Melchizedek materials are found in only one recension. This argument is not itself logical; but the facts are otherwise. The tradition is found in both recensions, in six MSS representing four text families. 4 F.

It is generally recognized that there is a longer and a shorter recension. This is a distinction in the character of the text, quite apart from the length of the extracts found in individual manuscripts. More precisely one can distinguish a very long recension (J, P, with P2 as a brief extract of a text close to P), a long recension (R—physically longer even than J because it completes the Melchizedek section which J cuts short), a short recension (A, U, with Tr, Syn as extracts of the same kind of text), and a very short recension (B, N, V, B2, with Rum as an extract in the same tradition). The other manuscripts, which are only extracts, belong to other text traditions. Even manuscripts which are identified as being of the same kind are far from uniform among themselves. The closest pairs are P and P2, A and U, V and N; but even these vary extensively in spelling. Quite apart from the mistakes made by scribes, or the liberties with which they expanded or condensed to suit their purposes, difficult readings due to other causes, including simple incomprehension of material from an alien culture, such as the calendar in 2 Enoch, have compounded the problems. It is likely that every manuscript has suffered from such influences to a greater or a less degree; not one can claim to be intrinsically superior to the others. Another result of this hazardous transmission is that while some sections have survived in many manuscripts, others are known from only a few copies. In the extreme case, a reading found only once might prove to be authentic, although such readings are often no more than a divergence in one manuscript. When it is so hard to tell whether a solitary reading is a sole survivor from the original or an interpolation, it is better to present all the evidence and suspend judgment. The common mistakes of counting witnesses as a measure of a reading's claim and dismissing a reading because of meager attestation are, accordingly, particularly detrimental in 2 Enoch research. There are many indications that 2 Enoch is derived from sources foreign to Slavonic culture. Most, if not all, Slavonic literature of this kind was translated from Greek, and traces of such an origin may be discerned in 2 Enoch. But no Greek texts of 2 Enoch, or even parts of it, are known. This circumstance makes it all the more difficult to settle textual problems within the Slavonic manuscripts. The extensive and substantial differences between manuscripts of the longer recension (R, J, P, P2—two or three families) and manuscripts of the shorter recension (the main ones are A, U, V, N, B2, B—four or five families) constitute the major textual problem. The difference in length is due to two quite different features. There are blocks of text found only in the longer manuscripts; but even when the passages are parallel, the longer manuscripts tend to be more ample. At the same time there is so much verbal similarity when the passages correspond that a common source must be supposed; that is, we have recensions, not different versions. Furthermore, the very short manuscripts differ from the short ones in the same manner. Quite contradictory explanations have been offered for these facts. Earlier investigators, notably Sokolov and R. H. Charles, accepted the longer texts as nearest to the original, and explained the shorter ones as the result of condensation.6 N. Schmidt, A. Vaillant, and N. A. Meshchersky, in contrast, concluded that the longer texts were the result of expansion and heavy interpolation.7 The extra material, therefore, tended to be discarded as probably inauthentic. These scholars, however, differ quite extensively in their arguments, and in their conclusions about the production of the book through its various stages. Reserve is called for. All of the material calls for reassessment. At the very least we should remain 5 M. N. Tikhomirov, Merilo pravednoe po rukopisi XIV veka (Moscow, 1961). 6 M. I.

Abbreviation as well as expansion has almost certainly taken place. In the present state of our knowledge, the genuineness of any disputed passage is difficult to judge. The claims of the longer recension need special attention in the sections dealing with creation, chapters 24-33. These chapters contain many weird notions in the longer recension, some of which could be embellishments. But the shorter account is so incomplete and so disjointed that it seems more like the debris left after drastic revision than an original succinct account. Some, at least, of the creation passages found only in manuscripts of the longer recension are worthy of more serious attention than they have received. Original language Three possibilities have been defended by scholars. The work now exists only in Slavonic, and no certain trace of it has been found elsewhere. A. S. D. Maunder claimed that 2 Enoch was composed in Slavonic, and is a late medieval concoction.8 But this is quite improbable. It is possible that some early Slav assembled these materials and translated them, but he is hardly likely to have composed them. And the extensive connection with 1 Enoch, however indirect, can hardly be denied. Most of the early religious literature in Slavonic was translated from Greek; 2 Enoch can hardly be an exception. Other cases are known of rare works surviving on the fringes of civilization, in languages such as Ethiopic and Armenian. Greek is indicated as the language behind the Slavonic version, if not the language of the original composition, not only by the inherent historical possibilities of the case, but also by passages whose linguistic features preserve traces of Greek words and expressions. The best known of these are the anagram and the names of the planets in chapter 30. The anagram, which connects the name of Adam with the points of the compass, makes sense only in Greek. Yet such evidence is not entirely conclusive. First, this is an old tradition, and the Jews who mixed Greek science with their biblical studies took over this kind of terminology into Hebrew or Aramaic. Secondly, these key passages are missing from manuscripts of the shorter recension; so, if it could be shown that they are secondary interpolations, they do not prove that the original work as a whole was composed in Greek. The text abounds in Semitisms; but several explanations of this are possible. It is theoretically possible that the book, or at least parts of it, came directly from Hebrew into Slavonic. This is what Meshchersky has argued for the shorter recension, which he takes to be the original work.9 But it is more likely that the Semitisms are due to Hebrew (or Aramaic) sources behind the Greek version, or at least due to the cultivation of a biblical style in the Greek original. Now that it is known that parts of 1 Enoch existed in Aramaic in pre-Christian times,10 it is more credible that 2 Enoch stands in another stream of Enoch traditions stemming from similar sources, and perhaps even of comparable antiquity. An original Semitic composition can still be suspected; but after two stages of translation through Greek to Slavonic, it is not now possible to tell how much written material in a Semitic language might lie behind those portions of the text which still have Semitisms, let alone to determine which Semitic language it might have been. Date Since no manuscripts older than the fourteenth century are known, any time before that is available as the date by which the book reached its present form. But evidence for the complete texts of the two main recensions is somewhat later than that, and the earliest evidence (that of MPr) different from both of them. This divergence is probably the result 8 A. S. D. Maunder, \"The Date and Place of Writing of the Slavonic Book of Enoch,\" The Observatory 41 (1918) 309-16. 9 Sokolov, in his paper on the Phoenix, \"Feniks* v* apokrifakh' ob' Enokhg i VarukhS,\" in Novyi sbornik statei po slavyanovedeniyu, ed. V. I. Lamansky (St. Petersburg, 1905) pp. 395-405, pointed to pre-Christian writings in Heb. behind the Gk. text used by the Slav, translator. The suggestion that 2En (that is, the shorter recension, which he considers to be original) was actually translated directly from Heb. into Old Russian was first made, so far as I know, by N. A. Meshchersky in \"Sledy pamyatnikov Kumrana v staroslavyanskol i drevnerusskoi literature (K izucheniyu slavyanskikh versii knigi Enokha),\" Trudy otdela drevnerusskoi literature [TODRL] 19 (1963) 130-47; idem, \"Problemy izucheniya slavyano-russkol perevodnol literatury XI-XV vv.,\" TODRL 20 (1964) 180-231; and in the papers cited in n. 7 above. 10 J. T. Milik, The Books of Enoch: Aramaic Fragments of Qumran Cave 4 (Oxford, 1976)."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"of transmission in Slavonic, with extensive expansions and contractions (see nn. to the translation). The original translation could have been made in an early period of Slavic literacy, but even so the supposed Greek composition need not have been produced earlier than A.D. 1000. Of course the Greek author could have made use of ancient material, and almost certainly did. But the very freedom of the treatment makes it impossible to prove that any passage which resembles something in another work is a quotation, whether a quotation from 2 Enoch in some other work of known date (proving that 2En existed prior to the writing of the work which quotes it), or whether a quotation from some other work used by the author of 2 Enoch (proving that 2En must be later than the work which it quotes). And, quite apart from the elusive character of such evidence, even if it could be proved that 2 Enoch contains such a quotation, this might be no more than a late gloss, and not an integral part of the original work. Of this character are the references to the Julian calendar which are obvious glosses and settle nothing concerning the date of the main text. The suspected echoes of the New Testament seem to be of this kind, and betray more likely the hand of a Christian scribe than the mind of a Christian author. In view of this complicated situation, it is not surprising that dates ranging all the way from pre-Christian times to the late Middle Ages have been proposed for the production of 2 Enoch. The rather improbable suggestion that 2 Enoch is no more than a medieval assemblage leaves uninvestigated the more important question of when and where these gathered materials were produced. Recognizing that the book is in all likelihood the result of a long and complex process of collecting and editing—a process which we cannot now reconstruct—the question of date becomes more complicated. The task is to date and locate the major stages (admittedly hypothetical) in the literary growth of the work. The questions of date and provenance thus go together. Provenance All attempts to locate the intellectual background of 2 Enoch have failed. There must be something very peculiar about a work when one scholar, Charles, concludes that it was written by a hellenized Jew in Alexandria in the first century B.C., while another, J. T. Milik, argues that it was written by a Christian monk in Byzantium in the ninth century A.D. Affinities with the Qumran writings have been noticed; some of these can probably be explained by the use of 1 Enoch as the source of such features as the calendar. In spite of Milik's claims, and Vaillant's theory that 2 Enoch is a Christian revision of Jewish Enoch (lEn), very little can be demonstrated by way of direct connection between the two works, and the divergences are numerous and substantial. In particular, 1 Enoch has an interest in history not present in 2 Enoch, while 2 Enoch has an interest in creation not present in 1 Enoch. Independent of this connection is the interest in Melchizedek, which was lively at Qumran.\" If ancient, this part of 2 Enoch should be added to the Qumran Melchizedek traditions as background for the Christian treatment of this theme in Hebrews.12 The most remarkable token of continued puzzlement over this work is the failure of scholars to decide whether it came from Jewish or Christian circles. It hardly stands in the mainstream of either religion. In spite of its evident biblical style, there is no point at which it can be shown to depend on the text of the New Testament, barring obvious Christian glosses, whose extraneous character is betrayed by their presence in only one manuscript or at most in manuscripts of one family. There is not a distinctively Christian idea in the book. Alleged use of it in the New Testament (evidence that it is a pre-Christian Jewish work) is in passing phrases of a very general kind; either 2 Enoch and the New Testament are drawing on a common background, or else a later author is vaguely influenced by such expressions.13 11 In addition to Horton's monograph (cf. n. 3), see J. A. Fitzmyer, \"Further Light on Melchizedek from Qumran Cave 11,\" Essays on the Semitic Background of the New Testament (London, 1971) pp. 245-67. 12 For repeated arguments that the Melchizedek story in 2En is a pre-Christian Midrash see I.

It is more likely that Mt and 2En have a similar milieu than that a later Christian author of 2En was influenced by only one book of the NT."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Vaillant's arguments that 2 Enoch is a Christian revision of 1 Enoch are unconvincing. Quite apart from the difference in scope, his main point is that 2 Enoch is not quite so hard on sinners! It could be argued, however, that the rabbis were more lenient than the apostles in this matter, and there is nothing in 2 Enoch as savage as Revelation. As already noted, the suspected quotations from the New Testament, adduced by Vaillant and others, do not amount to much; but more important is the total lack of a Christian Savior or scheme of salvation. On the contrary, Enoch occupies an exalted position as God's chosen and prime agent which is totally incompatible with Christian belief in Jesus as Messiah. Judaism and Christianity agree in highlighting God's justice in punishing the bad and rewarding the good; but a higher virtue is compassion expressed in mercy toward repentant sinners. According to the Christian Gospel, this mercy is mediated to mankind through the incarnate divine Redeemer, and secured by his atoning passion. In contrast, 2 Enoch is altogether severe. In spite of one extraordinary passage which says that Enoch takes away the sin of the world, there is another which denies any efficacy for mediatorial prayer, even Enoch's. A blessed afterlife is strictly a reward for right ethical behavior. This does not mean that the work is Jewish; it lacks some of the most distinctive and definitive tenets of main-line Judaism. In fact, it knows nothing of developments between the Flood and the end of the world, so there is no place for Abraham, Moses, and the rest; there is no reference to the Torah. Instead, the writings attributed to Enoch are advanced as the essential guide to life and salvation; but the vital knowledge they convey does not go any further than belief in one God as the Creator, and the practice of a simple ethical code. It would go a long way toward solving the mystery of 2 Enoch if we could discover a religious community that venerated it on its own terms. If the work is Jewish, it must have belonged to a fringe sect. If it was ever a sacred scripture of a real group, they could have been a community of God-fearers (the highest virtue in 2En 43:3), who were able to combine a strictly Jewish belief in one Creator-God (based on Gen, but combined with hellenistic metaphysics) and simple but strict ethical rules, with speculations about the cosmos, including a tincture of astrology. Add to this some typical sectarian concern about such things as tying the four legs of an animal when making a sacrifice, which is documented as a deviant practice on the margins of Judaism,14 and a fanatical belief in the correctness of their own solar calendar (everything is regulated by astronomy, hence the week is not a unit in God's time and there is no interest in the sabbath).15 In some respects these features remind us of Philo's Therapeutae, whose simplicity Philo admired. But the Therapeutae, in contrast to the author of 2 Enoch, seem to have revered Moses. If 2 Enoch does go back to the turn of the era, it is a source of the highest importance for the history of syncretism of selected parts of the Jewish faith with cosmological speculation. It has no intellectual strength, for there is no system, and the attempt to be philosophical is spoiled by unreflective folk notions. 2 Enoch could derive from any region in which Jewish, Greek, Egyptian, and other Near Eastern ideas mingled. Proto-gnostic speculations, such as the ordering of the ranks of heavenly beings, or the suggestion that Adam was originally a heavenly creature expelled from a heavenly Paradise after his fall, are hard to pin down. Egypt, or Syria-Palestine, or Asia Minor could have been the seedbed; but it is impossible to discern how early or how late such ideas were around. There are ingredients suspected of being Iranian in origin;16 but in spite of claims sometimes made, the work is totally devoid of dualistic thinking, except for a passing belief that man is free to choose good or evil. There are, of course, fallen angels. As in 1 Enoch, they serve to explain Genesis 6:1-4; but there is nothing like the symmetry of the spirits of light and darkness as at Qumran.17 The Melchizedek legend constitutes a special problem. The fantastic details about this priest conflict both with Christian belief in Jesus as God's sole legitimate priest in heaven and with the Jewish idea that the descendants of Aaron (or Zadok) are God's sole legitimate 14 S.

The miraculous conception of Melchizedek without human father (not strictly virginal, and with no mention of a divine agent, such as the Holy Spirit) is a typical wonder story, made somewhat ridiculous to our taste by the circumstance of the spontaneous delivery of the infant from his mother's corpse. But it is certainly not an imitation of the account of Jesus' birth found in Matthew and Luke.18 No Christian could have developed such a blasphemy (and we can imagine a scribe refusing to copy this part); and why should a Jew answer the Christians in this way when a more obvious and more scurrilous explanation of Mary's pregnancy was at hand? The Melchizedek materials from Qumran, regrettably fragmentary, do not line up with the Melchizedek story in 2 Enoch, except in the very general sense of being Midrashim. But this evidence at least shows that at the turn of the era Midrashic embellishments of terse biblical accounts could take on quite fantastic elements. The more sober treatment in Hebrews, while including features not derived from the Old Testament (but not demonstrably derived from any other known materials), could well be a fresh Christian attempt to say something on this current subject that would fit in with the Gospel. If 2 Enoch does preserve ideas from an early setting in Palestine or nearby, its main importance would be its manner of interpreting the Torah. In particular, its various comments on the creation passages in Genesis could represent one of the earliest attempts to reconcile Scripture with science. Historical importance In every respect 2 Enoch remains an enigma. So long as the date and location remain unknown, no use can be made of it for historical purposes. The present writer is inclined to place the book—or at least its original nucleus—early rather than late; and in a Jewish rather than a Christian community. But by the very marginal if not deviant character of their beliefs, its users could have been gentile converts to moral monotheism based on belief in the antediluvian God of the Bible as Creator, but not as the God of Abraham or Moses. Theological importance Some passages sound as if there was a sect which accepted the Enoch writings as sacred scripture in the highest sense, but who they might have been we cannot now discern. The book is organized around the story of a journey and return, but it has no undergirding conceptual system. The monotheism is stark, but the God is altogether forbidding—not like the merciful father of all mankind that Jews and Christians believe in—and the attempts to describe him border on the ridiculous, although intended to be reverent and awesome. (The comparison with hot iron emitting sparks if we had only 22:1 could be judged an interpolation; for it occurs only in \"longer\" MSS. But it occurs again in 39:3, where it is found in both recensions.) Creation itself is explained by the extraordinary and quite unphilosophical notion that, when God alone existed, he was not at rest. A disproportionate amount of space is given to the duties of the innumerable angels in the various heavens, with the result that God himself is hardly involved in running the universe. In the longer recension the creation of man receives a lot of attention, and some analytical observations are made on his physiological and psychological constitution. The ethics are general and humane. The traditional form of beatitude as the medium of moral exhortation is extensively used. Embedded in the conventional moralizing, alongside such quaint ideas as man's accountability for his treatment of animals, is an ethical idea as sublime as any found in Jewish or Christian teaching, an idea equal to the noblest doctrines of any ancient moralist. Man is the facsimile of God, God's visible face. Any disrespect for any human being is disrespect for God himself. This interpretation of the imago del in ethical rather than metaphysical terms is quite enough to justify the inclusion of 2 Enoch within the Pseudepigrapha.

Unfortunately the manuscripts used were the worst representatives of the two recensions. G.N. Bonwetsch's German edition presented separate translations of the longer and shorter recensions based on all of Sokolov's published evidence.19 He presented the Melchizedek legend separately. P. Riessler's edition contains another German version.20 Vaillant's French edition, which highlights U, is the best working translation. He compiled ample textual and philological notes, but relegated to an annexe the material of the longer recension. Kahana made a Hebrew translation of R for his edition of the Pseudepigrapha.21 The reference system There is no schema of chapters and verses common to the manuscripts, and no agreed convention among modern scholars. Sokolov introduced his own verse numbers, which have been followed by some. Charles's schema is different again. Vaillant's method of referring to a passage by the page and line number in his edition has little to commend it, since it depends on the accidents of typesetting. The existing literature probably uses Charles's schema more than any other, so this has been retained here as much as possible. We have made the following minimal but necessary adjustments: (1) The chapter enumeration has been taken from the longer, rather than the shorter, recension, from which some whole chapters are missing and in which, at one point, the chapters come in a different sequence. (2) The chapter enumeration has been continued into the Melchizedek appendix, rather than numbering this as a distinct work. (3) Where Charles's verse numbers follow an abnormal verse sequence, we have changed the sequence to the text of A as a standard. (4) We have tried to mark the verse boundaries more precisely than Charles, and to make them the same for both recensions where they match. (5) We have supplied verse numbers for the long preface for convenience of reference. The translation and its presentation The translation tries to achieve three goals. It provides an idiomatic English translation of two prime manuscripts of 2 Enoch. It seeks to reproduce the peculiarities of the original sources as precisely as English will permit, even though the result might not be elegant. And it displays the two recensions side by side so that their similarities and differences may be viewed synoptically. These aims sometimes conflict. The two manuscripts chosen are A (for the shorter recension) and J (for the longer). Since they are not always complete or superior, they need to be supplemented at some points by the readings in other manuscripts. When a portion of the text is lacking in A or J, it will be supplied from another source of the same recension. When another manuscript has an important variant to a reading present in A or J, this alternative will be supplied in a footnote. All such supplementary material will be clearly identified. The main text always corresponds to either A or J, even when their readings are inferior or erroneous or unintelligible. When necessary an ambiguous passage is clarified in a note. Space forbids the provision of a full textual apparatus, which would be very large because of the endless variations in spelling. Variant readings have been restricted to those in which a material difference is involved. We have resisted the temptation to make the English more readable by smoothing out textual difficulties. A has been chosen to represent the shorter recension without prejudice as to its overall superiority. It was chosen for three reasons. First, because up to now it has never been published or used, and its very existence has escaped the attention of Western scholars; secondly, because the availability of photographs of A enables this lack to be remedied; thirdly, A is virtually identical with U, whose importance as an exemplar of the shorter recension is generally recognized. When another manuscript of the shorter recension has a 19 G. N.

Such passages could be either additions that have been made to A's kind of text, or original material that has been lost in A's line of transmission. Sometimes it will be obvious which of these explanations is more likely; but often it is not. It is wise at this time to leave such questions open. Quite a few manuscripts which stem from the shorter tradition are only excerpts; but there are some which preserve a more ample text, although not as complete as that of A and U. There are two main kinds. To keep the picture simple, only two additional manuscripts, one of each kind, have been used to supply supplementary material in the translation itself. Such extras obtained from B are put in (. . .). Manuscript V is the best representative of the third kind of shorter manuscript; its special readings are shown in |. . .|. A further reason for using V is the fact that it has never been published; hitherto we have depended on its inferior congener N, the source of Charles's B. In short, the translation of the shorter recension presented here is the text of A supplemented by B and V. A similar policy has been followed with the longer recension. J has been given pride of place for three reasons. First, because the full text has not been published before; secondly, because J is generally superior to P, its nearest congener, which has been prominent up to now as the source of Charles's A; thirdly, because J and P are further away from the shorter recension than R, the only other reasonably complete manuscript of the longer kind. We thus present the evidence of the most divergent texts. In addition, J goes on to the Melchizedek Midrash, which P lacks. Even so, it ends abruptly, and after 71:5 R is the only witness to the Melchizedek story in the longer tradition. Since P2 is virtually identical with P its readings hardly matter. Hence it is possible to present all the textual evidence for the longer recension by supplying supplementary readings from R in (. . .) and supplementary readings from P in |. . .|. The most common occasions for the latter are the chapter titles, including often the enumeration \"Word 4 1.' \" These are peculiar to P and obviously secondary, even within the longer tradition. Sometimes they interrupt the text in a most unsuitable way; see, for instance, the transition between chapters 47 and 48, 53 and 54, 56 and 57, and the chapter heading between verses 1 and 2 of chapter 60. Textual variants in the notes are alternatives, not supplements to what is in the main translations. Trivialities, such as the article, which does not exist in Slavonic, have not been included in this schema. {. . .} enclose a passage which is considered erroneous in the original manuscript, usually due to dittography. The translation is as literal as English will tolerate. An attempt has been made to preserve distinctions in the vocabulary of the original by always rendering the same Slavonic word by the same English word. This information is often important for textual history. The name for the deity is mainly gospodi, which is always rendered \"LORD.\" The occasional vladyku is \"Lord,\" and bogu is \"God.\" Since English has only one word for \"Paradise,\" we have used it for poroda (a loan) and translated the native rai as \"paradise.\" Without the aid of a concordance, we cannot guarantee complete success, since there are many pairs of synonyms of minor importance. The intensification of adjectives by means of the prefix pre-, which seems to be due to efflorescence in transmission of the text, is generally shown by means of \"very\" or, when it seems to be elative, \"supremely.\" There was no convenient way to avoid thereby obscuring the use of the adverb zelo, \"very.\" Our presentation of numbers as either words or numerals reproduces the peculiarities of the manuscripts. We have even preserved some peculiarities of spelling, where they are of interest. Thus the various spellings of proper nouns, like Mathusalam and Edem, are exactly as found in the originals. The synoptic display introduces numerous unsightly gaps into the printed text, especially in the shorter recension. We hope that the gain in facility for comparative study will outweigh the aesthetic loss.

Translator's note The purely provisional state of the present treatment of 2 Enoch must be underscored, at every level: text, translation, and notes. In spite of years of endeavor, including a visit to the U.S.S.R. in search of manuscripts, many needed materials are still not available. In particular, a thorough study of the Disputatio is essential, and it is an embarrassment that the present contribution must go forth before this task is accomplished. The progress we have made would have been impossible without the continual encour­agement of Professor James H. Charlesworth. Thanks to his tenacity, we were able to secure microfilms of the manuscripts A and J which are the basis of this edition. As editor, he and his staff have had an unusually difficult job in preparing these unfamiliar materials for the press. Although some will still maintain that 2 Enoch is a work of dubious authenticity (as a pseudepigraphon of the Old Testament, belonging with the other works in this volume, that is) and of doubtful value, all that has still to be debated thoroughly. Professor Charlesworth has insisted that a new attack on these problems requires a fresh presentation of the evidence. This translator wishes to acknowledge gratefully his share in the final production. SELECT BIBLIOGRAPHY Charlesworth, PMR, pp. 103-6. Delling, Bibliographic p. 160. Denis, Introduction, pp. 28f.

The titles in the MSS show a great variety. U is the same as A; J P R have a preface of similar form and scope, but with many differences. Rum has essentially the same text as theirs through vs. 2 of the preface. P and P2 begin: \"The Book (about) the secrets of Enoch, the son of Ared,\" after which P2 adds \"from The Pearl of Great Price\" and goes on immediately to the creation story in ch. 28, whereas P continues \"a man wise and loved by God.\" In R the work is called \"The book of the holy secrets of Enoch, a man . . .,\" continuing as in P. J's term \"story\" (slovo, lit. \"word\") is the same as that used by P for the individual chs. It can mean a literary work, or simply \"tale\" as in Slovo o polku Igoreve, \"The Tale of Igor's Expedition.\" Some titles do not have the word \"secret.\" MPr: \"From the book of righteous Enoch\"; B: \"The life of righteous Enoch, a man ...\" The latter— bytija—is reminiscent of Gen. P's title is very long; it designates Enoch as \"a wise man and beloved by God\" followed by a detailed note about the place and circumstances of making this copy. [The notes to 2En are more extensive than our general rule. This divergence is intentional because of the importance of the recently discovered MSS, and the refined methodology. J.H.C.] b. The titles vary between \"book\" and \"books.\" Thus Tr: \"which are called The Secret Books of Enoch\"; and V N: \"And these are the books (called) The Secrets of God, a revelation to Enoch\"; B2 is similar, but singular. This fluctuation could reflect a tradition that there were several, or many Enoch books and that this one is (1) a many-volumed work; or (2) one of these books (ot of A U is partitive); or (3) extracted from them. The last is appropriate when we have a deliberate excerpt, as in MPr. The other two meanings can be covered by the fact that this is at once an account of the origin of the many known books of Enoch and also one of them, although not one of the set which Enoch himself made in heaven. Great importance is attached to the books that Enoch wrote in heaven. God emphasizes their key role for the last generation (chs. 33, 35, 36) and Enoch repeats this several times in his final charge (chs. 47, 48, 50, 53, 54). These could be the secret books hidden away until the end-time (68:2). 2En is then the book that tells the story of these books. This awareness of a corpus of Enoch writings wider than 2En itself, but dealing with subjects which are listed in 2En, suggests that 2En was written with immediate and detailed knowledge of such books. It was an introduction to them. The repeated emphasis on the importance of these books for the spiritual well-being of the community of \"the last generation\"—\"the men of truth\" (35:2), who will study and obey these writings (36:1)—makes sense only if such works were actually available in the circles that produced 2En. The works which fit this best are the books now collected under lEn; the community that revered them must have been something like the Qumran community. But the community that generated them is not Qumran itself, for the surviving fragments of Enoch books in Aram, are older than the foundation at Qumran and the outlook of 2En is quite different from that at Qumran, except in the matter of the calendar. c. A galaxy of epithets has gathered around Enoch in the titles. Without tracing each one to its MS, they include (1) wise man, (2) great scribe, (3) great artificer, (4) righteous, (5) beloved by God. The additional appellative in A U resembles s Gi blgvi ode, which is conventional in titles to extracts from the lives of saints in Christian mis­cellanies. A scribe evidently considered 2En to be a similar hagiographical composition. He is, how­ever, called vladyko, \"master,\" rather than \"father.\" It is more likely that this refers to Enoch than to God. A double name for the deity is rare in 2En; then it is gospodinu bogu, \"LORD God.\" d. The MSS have so many different readings that it is hard to decide which is best. The more ample text of P is clear and logical, but Vaillant (Le livre des secrets d'Henoch: Texte slave et traduction francaise, p. xvii), supposing it to result from the corrections of a reviser, reconstructs the textual history as follows: v *vid(!telju byti «^ \"to be a viewer\"^^ Rum viditi y * vid&ti ljubiti B \"to see\"  \"to see, to love\" A U vidite ljubite  jr  \"you see, you love\" / vuzljubi ego da vidit J ^x^\"and he loved him so that he might see'' P ego vozljuby, i prijati ego gdi da vidit \"the Lord conceived love for him and received him, that he should behold ...\" (APOT, vol. 2, p. 431) A difficulty in Vaillant's restoration is that it supposes a different noun from the one at the end of the paragraph. This could be overcome by"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"2 ENOCH 2 ENOCH [A] la From the secret book(s)b about the taking away of Enoch the just,c 1 a wise man, a great scholar, whom the LORD took away. 2 to see,e to love the highest realm; 3 and of the most wise and great,  unchanging  4 and almighty sovereignty of God, #and of the very great many-eyed and immovable throne of the LORD, and of the brightly shiningk reading vidici at both places; but the form in -/ is essential for his theory that the verb \"love\" has arisen by misdivision. There can be no doubt that the statement goes back ultimately to Gen 5:24: \"Enoch walked with God. Then he vanished because God took him.\" This is altogether laconic. It could mean no more than an explanation of Enoch's premature death as an act of God. In Job 1:21 the same idiom means removal by death. In Gen 42:36 'enennu, \"he is not,\" means \"he is dead.\" In 2Kgs 2:3 the Lord \"took\" Elijah to heaven without dying, and it was easy to see this as supplying the missing details of Enoch's translation. This becomes explicit in Heb 11:5, and in Idem 9—he \"was translated, and death was never known to happen to him.\" LXX is literal—hoti metetheken auton ho theos. Sir 44:16 and Heb 11:5 use the passive metetethe, a pious convention already evident in lEn 12:1 (elemphthe). In this respect 2En is more primitive, or at least closer to the Heb. than these later accounts. In any case Charles's \"received\" is uncertain, if it is not his reception but his removal. e. The words \"to see . . .\" and \". . . to be a witness\" (vs. 6) constitute an inclusion around the long list of noun phrases which describe what Enoch saw. Strictly speaking the comprehensive term \"the upper(-most) realm\" is the object of \"see\" and all the rest is the object of \"witness.\" Morrill's original division of the list was mistaken (The Book of the Secrets of Enoch [Oxford, 1896] p. 1). The list itself is carelessly compiled. It covers only a small part of the contents of the book, since it corresponds mainly to the seventh heaven. f. Sokolov solved the textual problem discussed above by emending to ljubitelja. Enoch is to become a lover of the upper regions. This is altogether improbable. The phrase vyfnjag(o) iitia of A is plural in J P. Hence \"the heavenly abodes\" (Mor-fill, Secrets of Enoch, p. 1) or \"uppermost dwell­ings\" (Forbes, APOT, vol. 2, p. 431), miskenot merdmim (Kahana, Ha-Sefarim ha-Hitsonim le-Torah [Jerusalem, 1936-37; reprinted 1978]). There is no need to compare this with Jn 14:2. The plural could have arisen from within the book itself, which does talk about eternal residences prepared for both good and bad. In ch. 61, however, three quite different words are used—khranilista, \"shel­ters,\" khraminy, \"residences,\" domy, \"houses.\" Here the singular is correct. Like politeuma (Phil 3:20) zitie can refer to manner of life, with an emphasis on order. This is its sense in 68:4—\"this present life.\" B has a gloss—niinjaja i vySnjaja, \"lower and upper.\" 2En did not include a subterranean hell in its cosmos. In fact, one of the remarkable things about 2En is that its nearest equivalent to a tradi­tional hell is a region in the north of the third heaven (ch. 10). But there are some passages which are under pressure to include the netherworld (18:7). The gloss in the preface of B is another result of the same tendency. It does not fit, because Enoch makes no visit to any lower region. But cf. 40:12. g. Slav, premoudryi \"wise\" (A), is not a suit­able attribute of \"kingdom\" (cSsarlstvo [AJ) unless the latter means \"reign\" (cfsaristvije [J]). It applies to God, where J uses mudryi, which suits Enoch (see n. c). h. \"Sovereignty\" or \"kingdom.\" C&sarstvo can be abstract or concrete, like the Gk. basileia, which it habitually translates. i. This epithet has a different referent in each list. The variation between the recensions in the use of the adjective \"many-eyed\" may reflect conflicting traditions about its appropriate use. The normal spelling is munogo-ofityi. P (mnogooditago) is better than U (mnogotita*). This, like other words in the preface, echoes Christian liturgical terms. In Ezek 4 the four creatures who are God's seat and vehicle are \"full of eyes\" (4:18). Their connection with the throne is clear from Rev 4:6, but 2En distinguishes the throne from the \"station\" of the Lord's servants, and J P ascribe \"many-eyed\" to the latter, A U to the former. Ezek 10:12 has a more extravagant description of creatures whose bodies are covered with eyes. The preface keeps the seraphim and cherubim distinct from these, and from each other. The latter are connected with singing, the former are probably intended by the fourth item, for they are either \"bodiless\" (J) or \"fireborn\" (A). In other texts they are associated as \"many-eyed\" and \"six-winged,\" e.g. munogooditii kherovimi i Sestokrilataa serafima (SJS, vol. 2, p. 241). j. R at this point lacks five words and portions of two others. A space is left. One fragment supports J's nepodviiimago (\"immovable\") against P's ne-postilimago (\"incomprehensible\"). Vaillant inter­prets it as \"immobile,\" but Ezek 1 suggests the opposite. The idea is closer to Heb 12:28. Unlike Ascenls, which has a throne in each heaven, 2En knows only the throne of God in the seventh heaven. k. A U do not use 2En's characteristic \"glo­rious,\" found in J P R, but their presvttla, \"very bright,\" is a synonym."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"[J] •and of the ranks and organization of the bodiless 5 armies, and of the indescribable composition of\"1 the multitude\" of elements, •and of the variegated appearance\" and indescribable 6 singing of the armyp of the cherubim,q and of the light without measure/ to be an eyewitness.\" 1 |Concerning Enoch's dream| At that time\" he said, When 165 years were complete for me, I fathered my son 1 Methusala; and after that I lived 200 years. I completed all the years of my life, 365 years. #In the first month/ on the 2 assigned dayd of the first month, I was in my house alone. 1. Lit. \"fireborn.\" Unless reflected in this word, the seraphim are not included in the list of the preface. They are present in 20:1, 21:1 in long MSS. Fire and light are fundamental elements in the physics of 2En. Fire enjoys varying prominence in the several creation sections of the book. Light is primary, fire derivative. Darkness comes first (ch. 24), then light (ch. 25). Water is made from light (ch. 27), rock is made from water (ch. 28), and fire comes from rock (ch. 29). The angels are created from this fire (29:3). m. The term \"ministration\" (APOT, vol. 2, p. 431) derives from P's sluienia. This is a mistake due to the frequency of slouienije elsewhere in 2En, where it refers to the liturgy rather than, say, the service of administrative duties. No other MS has it. All the rest read sloienija. It is true that the heavenly beings are called \"elements\" at various points, and the preface is mainly interested in angels, not physics; but these are not the primal matter—four \"elements\" or even one. They are multitudinous. Slav, sloienije could be the inde­scribable \"composition\" of any one of these ele­ments (in that case they would not be elementary); or else the innumerable formulae by which the elements combine to make the diverse materials of the universe. Here, as elsewhere in 2En, it is hard to decide whether the texts have drifted from scientific ter­minology (\"combination of elements\") to some­thing more mythological (the organization of the various ranks of beings), or the reverse. n. Slav, munoiistvo normally renders the Gk. plethos. Does the longer reading of A U represent the biblicism \"myriad myriad\"? The word \"ele­ment\" (stikhii or stoukhii) could be the physical elements or \"ranks\" of angelic beings. We cannot tell how close this is to the stoikheia of the NT. In 2En 13:9 the stoukhii are angels of some kind. o. The recensions differ at this point. R is defective. J P: ob'javlenie, \"manifestations\" (?). p. Or \"host,\" Heb. sdba and sebadt. This terminology pervades 2En. The military character of the Lord's heavenly retinue goes back to the war theology of early Israel. 2En stills knows of \"armed\" troops, but no combat is reported. Some angels serve as guards of prisoners, even as tor­turers. Otherwise the parade order is that of a choir. Little can now be discerned of a chain of command, although there seems to be an echelon of officers. It is no longer possible to discern the human army upon which this celestial counterpart might have been modeled. q. As in the West, the Heb. plural has been taken as the stem, and repluralized with Slav, suffixes. r. The idea of boundless light occurs in Pistis Sophia. s. The translation \"eyewitness\" attempts to dis­tinguish the variant samovideci from vidici or viditeli. 1 a. The reading from Jn 3 in OE begins with such a phrase, which is not in the Gk. But the position of the adjective there (vw ono vrimja) is not as Hebraic as 2En 1:1. This abrupt beginning sounds like the continuation of some preceding narrative, and suggests that 2En is part of a larger work, a Midrash on Gen. But note that the second Lat. recension of the GBart begins in exactly the same way. The ending of 2En is similarly abrupt since a continuation into the story of the Flood is called for. The story presupposes that the reader knows the background, but no explanation is given of Enoch's grief. The book does not even repeat the one thing that Gen says (twice!) about Enoch, namely, that he walked with God. This unprepared onset makes it necessary to supply some kind of title. The one now present is clearly artificial, and its limited attestation and wide variation shows that it is an addition; but it cannot be a late addition, since it is found in MSS of both recensions which have already diverged substan­tially in details. We can suppose, then, the extraction from a larger Midrash of the history from Enoch to the Flood, and its designation, rather inexactly, \"the Book of Enoch\" or the like. This is a misnomer, except for those MSS which end with the second ascension of Enoch. This has led to an altogether prejudiced assessment of the Melchizedek portion. While the Enoch story occurs without the Methu­selah, Nir, Melchizedek continuation, the latter"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"[A] 5 station of the LORD'S servants, #and of the ranks of the powerful, fireborn,1 heavenly armies, the indescribable combination of a 6 great multitude of elements, *and of the variegated appearance and indescribable singing of the army of the cherubim, and of the light without measure, to be a witness. 1 1 And at that time Enoch said, When 365b years were complete for me,  Gen 5:21-23 2    *in the first month, on the assigned day of the first month, I was in my house alone, never occurs except as part of the Book of Enoch. There is continuity; and the references back to Enoch in the Melchizedek section, as well as the similarity of style, suggest an original and integral work. Charles's omission of this Melchizedek ma­terial is thus unfortunate and mistaken. b. Cf. Gen 5:23. A connection with the solar year has been suspected in this figure. But the solar year in 2En was originally 364 days. c. V N read \"second.\" Morgenstern (1924) has shown that at least three different calendars were used in ancient Israel. In the first (based on the solar year), the Canaanite names of the months were used. In the second system, the months were designated by number, the first corresponding to a New Year in the fall. The third system was the Babylonian lunar-solar calendar (still in use), and the Babylonian names were used. These appear also in 2En 73, complicated by the presence of Egyptian month names as well. This feature of 2En is thus typically Jewish. But this does not mean that 2En is to be explained in terms of the Jewish liturgical year as we know it from biblical or rabbinic sources. In fact, its defiant use of a solar calendar points away from this. Its first month, which probably means the New Year month, could begin with the spring equinox. Since this calendar divides the year into four equal seasons, this would mean that Enoch finally went to heaven at the summer solstice, a suitable time for such an event. If Morgenstern is right in his argument that the latest priestly legislation embod­ied in biblical rules for observing both Passover and Sukkoth has swung into line with the Baby­lonian lunar calendar in which the first full moon after the autumn equinox takes place on the fifteenth day of the first month, with an intercalated month from time to time as needed, then 2En's calendar is different in many respects. 2En has only a trace of the Metonic cycle of nineteen years, found also in the Babylonian calendar, and accordingly passed on to Christians as well. But 16:8 is an evident gloss. 2En is heterodox in the matter of the calendar, but not unique. Quite apart from its possible dependence on lEn for such details, its agreement with Jub suggests similar antiquity. Yet in other respects it diverges from Jub and Qumran. It has no interest in a seven-day week nor in sabbath observance. The few references are glosses never integrated with prime texts. So we cannot tell whether 2En is a later reflex of this interest in a 364-day solar calendar, and that of a rather aca­demic kind, found only among scribes; or whether it is archaic and conservative, and of vital impor­tance to a community that tried to use such a calendar. J. Morgenstern (\"The Three Calendars of An­cient Israel,\" HUCA 1 [1924] 13-78, esp. p. 65) definitely thinks that the calendar of lEn and of Jub, in spite of the unworkable 364-day year, is related to the old Canaanite solar calendar. In fact, Jub 6:36-38 contains a polemic against the lunar calendar as an innovation. 2En does not contain such polemic, but its lunar calendar is geared to the solar year. At least it can be said that the Enoch writings have a solar year with New Year at the vernal equinox, and this sets the date for Enoch's first translation. d. The best MSS of both recensions agree that the day is narotitil. R has a unique gloss which effects repetition of the whole expression—\"in the first month, on the intended day of the first month, on the first day.\" It uses the numeral a, but the adjective pruvyi each time with \"month.\" A U, however, have mc a a, and this numeral could have produced R's numeral, since the sequence is the same. J has a reading much closer to A U, except that, like P and R, it reverses the noun-adjective sequence. This agreement of A U J then gives the best reading—\"in the first month, on the designated day of the first month.\" In P this has been simplified to \"on the 1st day of the first month,\" thus eliminating the obscure technical word. We cannot assume that it was a Jewish New Year's Day. Indeed, Jewish custom rules this out. According to Megillat Ta'anit (17b, 18a) 1-8 Nisan was a period in which it was forbidden to mourn or to use penitential self-mortification, and the first in particular, a new-moon day, could not be other than joyous. The scribal error \"first\" could only arise from ignorance of Jewish practice, unless 2En is heterodox."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"[J] And I lay on my bed, sleeping. #And, while I slept, a great distress entered my 3 heart, and I was weeping6 with my eyes in a dream.g And I could not figure out what this distress might be, |nor| what might be happening to me.

There is a tradition that apocalyptists are upset by evil in the world, or by inability to understand the plan of God (Dan 7:15; Rev 5:4; 4Ezra 3). lEn 83:3 explains that Enoch was already distressed by the evil brought upon the world by the fallen Watchers. But a presupposition that this lies behind Enoch's unexplained grief in 2En is not needed. The motif could have been derived from a traditional convention. f. The sequence A U is inferior. V N read \"I was distressed, weeping with my eyes,\" a better idiom. g. R lacks nine words found in J P (\"in a dream [or sleep] and I could not understand what is distress\"), so that the remaining words (\"This which might be to me\") are quite unintelligible. P replaces li with Hi. A U lack this statement entirely, and, furthermore, have a much simpler picture: Enoch is lamenting (no reason is given) and falls asleep. Then the two men appear. J P, however, and R in part, have a more complex development. The weeping is part of the dream. If this is true, then there is less need to look for some liturgical setting for an act of penitence. After all, Enoch is alone, in his house, on his bed. But the recensions are different in this respect. A gives the impression that first Enoch was weeping alone in his house. No reason is given. Worn out by grief, he lies down and falls asleep. He dreams that he sees two men. In J the onset of distress occurs after he falls asleep, again with no hint as to its cause. The place of this dream in the story is hard to assess. The two \"men\" first appear in the dream, then, when he wakes up, they are present in reality. They could just as easily have come for him while he was awake, so Enoch's dream contributes noth­ing to the plot. h. Some MSS have the numeral. In what follows the better MSS often use dual forms; but we have refrained from translating this pedantically as \"the pair of men.\" i. The appearance of figures of gigantic size is a common motif in apocalypses of the early period. Compare 4Ezra and the Gospel of Eve. In GPet the two young men (!) who appeared at the tomb of Jesus were tall (\"their heads reached into heaven\") and the risen Lord was even taller (ANT, p. 92). V agrees with J P R in reading privelika z&lo, \"very big indeed,\" but A lacks the prefix. j. Note the fluctuation between \"man\" and \"angel\" in Zech 1. We are to suppose angels in human form taken for the occasion. Their names are given, rather casually, in 33:6. Even so, their dimensions, and the following description, show that this was not a disguise. In fact human form need not be implied and \"man\" might mean, simply, \"person.\" The coming of angels in pairs is an ancient tradition, going back to the two \"messengers\" who conventionally accompany a god on a journey in Canaanite mythology. Hence the two \"men\" who accompany the Lord on his visit to Abraham (Gen 18f.; cf. Gen 32:25). Com­pare the \"two men\" at the empty tomb (Lk 24:4). Compare Acts 1:10 and 2Mac 3:26 (\"There also appeared to Heliodorus two young men of sur­passing strength and glorious beauty, splendidly dressed\"). The \"two young men\" are angels. Cf. 2En 33:11. k. A U lack the words supplied, which are found not only in J P R, but also in other MSS of the short recension (V N B B2). The loss is due to homoeoteleuton of repeated jako. A U's reading \"his mouth\" is clearly inferior; ego can be ex­plained as a corruption of the dual (j)eju (which V N R use correctly), which B and others have replaced by plural ikh. J P have the dative. A U have also moderated the concrete imagery by adding \"like\" to fire, not found in B B2. 1. The addition of jako to A U is inferior, since other \"short\" MSS lack it. m. The text at this point seems to be incorrigibly corrupt. The MSS agree with surprising unanimity, since the variants are mainly orthographic: A peniju razdaaniju U peniju razdajaniju B p£nija razdnaja B2 pSrle razltfno V i penie razlidno N pgnie razlid'no R pgnie razdeanie J penie razdanie"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"[A] 3          4Ezra3:I          weeping and grievingf with my eyes.

Singing is a common theme in this book; at least it is a characteristic activity of the angels in the heavens. But it seems out of place at this point, where the whole interest is in the appearance of the men, and, specifically, their clothing. The matter is complicated by variation in the adjective that goes with \"singing,\" although here the agree­ment of A and J is weighty. n. At this point MSS of the shorter recension read like a garbled abbreviation; they have confused \"the arms\" and \"the wings.\" o. Compare the bird in the story of the ascension of Alexander, who forbids him to enter heaven. p. This is the conventional stance of a dream visitor in relation to a sleeper. This is how the Lord stood \"beside\" Jacob in his dream at Bethel (Gen 28:12f.) as in NAB, not RSV, where the Lord is placed above the ladder. Compare ISam 3:10. q. When the Lord appears in a vision he often addresses the person by name. r. The MSS differ in the verb used to describe Enoch's arousal; and they do not divide into long and short. Both alternatives are found in MSS of both recensions, as V vizbnouv shows, while P has vostakh, closer to A U. Something similar happens with \"my\" in \"my sleep\"; V (short) agrees with R (long) in reading svoego; J P (long) agree with A U (short) in moego. A has the participle \"having stood up.\" s. The term \"actuality\" implies objectivity, not a dream. It means that what he saw on waking was exactly the same as what he had seen in his dream, as just described. t. Slav, az ze uskorikh i vstakh. The awkward­ness of the construction, which seems to be a Hebraism (w'mhr w'qm), is shown by the chaos of MS readings. The normal idiom in Slav, is uskoriti plus the infinitive, which means \"to speed up,\" not just \"to act quickly.\" One variant (V N R) is oujadri, also followed by an infinitive. But R has dropped the second verb, and reads \"I hastened to them,\" while J P have dropped the first verb. V changed vstakh to the participle vustavi, which reverses the sequence of actions. u. Unlike John's angelic guide, who rebuked him for such behavior (Rev 19:10), and the angel in Ascenls, Enoch's visitors accept the homage. Cf. Gen 18:2. v. The MSS differ considerably in their descrip­tion of Enoch's reaction to the appearance of the men, making it difficult to establish what the original author might have said. There is agreement that his basic response was one of fear, and longer MSS have the verb ouzasokhsja as well as the noun strakhu. This is part of the conventional response to such an epiphany. The traditional accounts of such events have doubtless molded the account here. The following words of assurance are also part of the scenario. Such stories have probably contaminated the text in transmission. The longer text of J is the most general: \"and the appearance of my face was changed ot strakha (apo phobou).\" There are variants corresponding to the words \"appearance\" and \"changed.\" The simple vidinie of J (vidgnie of P) matches prividgnije of A U. Vaillant (Secrets, p. 4, n. 16) incorrectly states that both these similar readings derive from R's original zrinjem, from which he goes on to restore the unattested original * sriniemi, suggesting a cold, rather than a bloody, sweat. But \"hoar-frost\" is hardly acceptable; the emendation is too conjectural. Such a change could be due to the fact that \"the appearance of my face\" is redundant. Other MSS, notably B, read simply \"my face.\" R's variant zrinje suggests that Enoch's vision was blurred; but this contradicts the statement that the men were plainly visible. More likely it means \"my face changed at the vision,\" hence the instrumental; zirHnije, \"sight,\" can be subjective or objective (SJS, vol. 1, p. 691). A's variant points in the same direction since prividtnije (SJS, vol. 3, p. 261) has the connotation of \"apparition\" (phantasma); hence the instrumental case. There are several variants of the verb. R could mean \"I covered up my face from fear.\" Compare APOT, vol. 2, p. 431 (derived from N). B says \"my face was covered with tears (rydaniem),\" but B2 has rdeniemu. The image is incongruous, since"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"[J] brave, Enoch! In truth,w do not fear!

And may God make your hearts true in reverence for him.j And now, my children, no one must search for me until the LORD returns me to you.\" oblijati (SJS, vol. 2, p. 477) means to cover by pouring something over something. Thus the story of Boris and Gleb includes the words: / visi slizami oblijavu sja rede, \"and with all tears covering himself, he said:\" (US 12b: 25-27). Compare i vodoju oblijati lice jeja, \"and with water to cover her face\" (US 138b: 18-19). So we have the idiom \"my face was bathed with sweat.\" The reading of A U, ble$tac(a), suggests that his face was shining (or blanched?). The verb really means \"to be radiant,\" and it is not part of the vocabulary usual for the terror response to an epiphany of this kind (SRY, vol. 1, p. 238). It would be more appropriate for the visitors. Thus the translation of Luke's version of the resurrection story in the Ostromir Gospel describes the two men in dazzling apparel (24:4), vu rizakhu bliStjastakhu sja. The women are terrified and fall to the ground. In view of the mobility of the vowels, and their frequent omission in spelling, we suggest either that A U means \"and they were dazzling [white]\" or that it should read * btlestasja or the like, meaning \"the appearance of my face turned white.'' w. R agrees with J, \"in truth.\" This additional phrase resembles a reading of Zech 8:13 found in Glagoliica Iosephi Vajs: dizaite v istinu i kriptte ruki vaSe. R has \"LORD\" instead of God, found in other MSS. B and V agree in the variant \"youth'' for \"Enoch.\" Cf. ch. 10, n. j. x.

The readings in A and V are dual (compare 1:10) because two sons of Enoch are known in the short recension. But the next occurrence is plural. MSS of the longer recension have three sons in 1:10 and plural 4'children.'1 Dual forms are also used fairly consistently to refer to Enoch's two angelic escorts. Of the seven injunctions, V has only the first three and the last. It is remarkable, but perhaps coincidental, that this omission corre­sponds roughly to the lacuna in P. d. Slav, sudby, \"judgments,\" is the better read­ing, since R agrees with A U. P has a large lacuna at this point; hence Charles's A text. J reads zapovidi, *'commandments.\" This is a significant variant, for it draws attention to the difficulty felt with the original suduby. The latter is a palpable Semitism, obviously miSpdtfm, often used in the OT to include ethical instructions or moral customs. But for scribes who knew suduby = Gk. krimata the meaning of \"verdicts, punishments\" does not suit; hence the change to the word that translates entolai. e. Perhaps J R mean \"make your prayers for salvation odious (to God).\" In any case the reading is inferior. The original was intended for a com­munity which practiced sacrifice. f. B adds 44Bless the LORD!\" g. R J repeat \"firstborn.\" The identity of the second item is not clear. Vaillant's \"oxen\" is the result of emendation. The dominant yunot (R) or yunos~i(B) (agreement between long and short MSS is important) is not intrinsically difficult (Ex 13:2; 22:29f.; 34:19f.). J reads vnucjat, \"grandchil­dren,\" which, however curious, at least confirms that they are human. A U agree in nuty, \"oxen\"; but it is more likely that this easier reading is secondary, since there are accompanying altera­tions. h.

Their secondary character is shown by two features. They often use language identical with the text that follows, which brings about repetition; or they introduce new (later) terms not found in prime texts. MSS which have a title at this point vary between vzjatie (?) and vuskhoz-enie (V). A U have vuskhyStenije at the beginning. The translation \"assumption\" (APOT, vol. 2, p. 432) is scarcely warranted. SJS (vol. 1, p. 298) lists vuzjatie as occurring only in Euchologium Sinaiticum. The corresponding verb vuzjati, which is simply laqah or lambanein, is common in 2En and is generally used when the two men \"take\" Enoch from place to place. Vuskhoz(d)enije is anabasis, while vuskhys'tenije is \"rapture.\" b. With no other indication of a new ch., A has .a. in the middle of the line. V completes the line with :»~ :»~ and then has a rubric—vuskhozenie enokhovo na .a.-e nbo, which has a certain affinity with P's ch. heading. c. The Hebraic character of the narrative com­position is manifest in the abundant parataxis, and especially in the opening \"and it was\" (= wayehi). The unacceptable character of this idiom is shown by its alteration, either by dropping \"and\" (R P) or by changing bysti to bykhu, \"I was\" (A U). The latter is influenced by the autobiographical form, which is sustained in this ch. But P has changed \"me\" to \"him\" through the whole of vs. 1 (APOT A), against all other witnesses. It reverts to first person in vs. 2. d. At this point A has a nbo in the margin, and a very large / to begin the next section. B has a similar ch. heading. e. It should be noted that P is the only MS that calls the \"men\" \"angels\" at this point. All agree that they have wings. In the longer MSS the journey has two stages: First Enoch is placed on the clouds, then on the first heaven (same idiom). The clouds are a vantage point, not a vehicle. Although J supports R's \"they were moving,\" P's \"I looked\" is superior. In describing the two stages the words \"and they placed me on\" occur twice. The inter­vening material is lacking in short MSS, an obvious instance of loss by homoeoteleuton, which is very common in these MSS. But Vaillant considers extra material an inept addition by the reviser. But the text of P (APOT) is garbled; J and R agree that Enoch distinguished the air vuzdukh from the aieri, borrowing this Gk. word to designate the ether. According to Eph 2:2 this is Satan's domain. Compare 2En 29:5. If the text of 2En came from a Gk. original, the correct sequence would be aer aither. Having translated the first by vozdukh, the second would have been borrowed. Hence the ignorant use of the loan suggests composition in Slav. This distinction between atmosphere and stratosphere is already present in Homer. Made more systematic by later philosophers, ether be­comes the fifth element. 2En is thus nearer to Homer than to Aristotle. These layers are met in a six-tier scheme in a prayer in ActsJn (112). f. This verse is 4:2 in A U. Several motifs of 2En 3 are found in TAb 7:19-8:3. 4 a. The Sestodnevtsa (No. 238) of Prince P. P. Vyazemsky calls the ten archangels, whose names it gives, who are commanders of the ten orders of angelic powers, \"the elders of the heavenly forces.\" 2En's elders are distinct from the two hundred angels who govern the stars. There seems to be a chain of command; so the elders could be senior angels, but in early Jewish and Christian literature the elders in heaven seem to be human. (A. Feuillet, \"Les vingt-quatre vieillards de I'Apocalypse,\" RB 65 [1958] 5-32). 2En does not say how many elders there were. They are not the same as the \"leaders\" of lEn 82, for they are in charge of the seasons (four) and months (twelve), whereas the elders in 2En are \"lords of the starry divisions.\" The location of angels on this first (the lowest) heaven is contrary to the usual astronomy which locates the (fixed) stars above the spheres of the seven planets. In 2En also (21:6—long MSS only) the stars and \"the heavenly houses of the 12 zodiacs\" are in the ninth heaven. This contradicts ch. 4, and also the account of creation in ch. 30, where the stars are placed in the lowest heaven, with the moon, or even below that in the air (30:4).

And the angels were flying with their wings. Rev 4:6; 15:2: TLcvi 2:7 supplied by the Beth Alpha mosaic. In its center circle the sun is surrounded by twenty-three stars and the crescent moon. Putting stars and the moon together corresponds to 2En 30:4. The number twenty-four corresponds to the number of elders in Rev. It is important to emphasize that although ch. 30 is almost totally lacking from short MSS, they do have the stars in the first heaven in 4:1. b. The correlative terms Sestvije and prekhoi-enije occur again in 11:1 (with many variants in the latter term among the MSS). They invite a search for something precise by way of astronomical terminology. In describing the various cycles of nature, the verbs \"go in\" (vukhod-) and \"go out\" (izkhod-) are used, along with many variants, such as viskhod; proiskhod-, prikhod-, obkhod-. At most points the MSS display great uncertainty as to which verb to use. Thus 5:2 describes the movements of clouds. According to J they go out and they go in; according to A they go in and they go out. Two pictures are possible. Either the clouds go into the treasuries and then go out into the sky, or they come out into the sky and then return to the treasuries. The latter is probably intended, because the rising and setting of the sun and moon are described by the verbs vkhoditi (\"he enters\") and iskhodit (\"he leaves\"), although even this language is not used consistently. Thus in ch. 13 the rising of the sun for half the annual cycle is iskhodit, but vkhodit for the remainder (which Vaillant, Secrets, p. 12, wants to correct to vuskhoditu). It could depend on the point of view of the observer. As we see it, the sun comes into the world in the morning and goes out at night. From the sun's point of view, he goes out into the world when he rises and goes back in at night. Both Sistvije and pr$khoi[d\\enije can denote movement in general; but obkhoienije probably connotes \"return.\" Note that in 13:4 obuSistvije is the seasonal turning of the year. So the terms might refer to the waxing and waning of the moon (although the month lengths do not fit that) or to the recession of the sun up to midwinter and his return up to midsummer, a phenomenon described in 48:3. We conclude that Sestvije describes regular move­ment, such as the rising and setting of the sun; and prekhoienije describes a perturbation imposed on that, such as the annual movement of sunrise point across the horizon that lies behind ch. 13. The \"aberrations\" of the stars, referred to here, would then be another way of looking at hai tropai heliou. Thus Cancer is in conjunction with the sun at the summer solstice; and so on. The following phrase, \"from year to year,\" can thus be taken literally. Vaillant's translation, d'un temps d un autre (Secrets, p. 7), recognizes a stage in the language when godu still meant simply \"time\" and not yet precisely \"year.\" But the phrase used here seems to mean \"annually\" (SJS, vol. 1, p. 414). This fits in with the calendrical interests of 2En, which describes the movements of the sun and moon through the course of a year, but does not go into conjunctions and eclipses which vary from year to year. We cannot be certain; because ch. 4 might be speaking only about the planets, not the fixed stars. But note 30:4. c. Slav, vu sve'te' (A), vo svfre (U). This reading is demonstrably in error, since all long MSS (J P R) read .c., the numeral 200, and so do V N. B B2 have the word dvisti. Vaillant plausibly supposes an intermediate * .v. sti (forduvisuti, both duals), which some scribe has misread as an abbreviation of vu svfre', \"in the light.\" It is important to emphasize that the same error has given rise to the spurious \"Lord of light\" in 2En 18:3 (APOT, vol. 2, pp. 439f.); see the n. there. d. \"Combinations.\" P's reading. Slav, sluien-ija, \"services\" (APOT, vol. 2, p. 432), must be discarded, although it is found in B also. All other MSS agree in slozenia. See the same confusion in la:5. Vaillant's translation combinaisons des cieux may be questioned, especially since he annotates: sans doute les constellations. Except for a reference to the zodiac in 21:6 (probably spurious), 2En does not discuss the constellations, and here the \"com­binations\" are probably the conjunctions of the planets. e.

Vaillant's interpretation (Secrets, p. 9) of this obscure phrase, found only in the longer recension, is an improvement on the previous \"and come around all those who sail\" (\"swimmers,\" APOT, vol. 2, p. 432). It is true that plavati primarily describes swim­ming or marine navigation, but I have not found any other occurrences of the planets as \"swim­mers\" in heaven. It seems unlikely that these angels have jurisdiction over travel on the great celestial ocean that has just been described. The immediate context, in longer MSS at least, is the government of stars. The idea that angels supervise the heavenly bodies in their movements is promi­nent in 2En. The verb obukhoditi, \"go around, surround,\" fits the picture. We are to imagine that the obukhodinikii (= periodeutes, an itinerant inspector)4 'does the rounds''. of the4 'stars'' making sure that they are functioning properly. Regularity is not automatic; there are no fixed laws of nature identical with the will of God or the truths of mathematics. But since the planets have been given their normal name \"stars\" in vs. 1, we cannot be sure that plavajuStikhu means 4'planets\" precisely, but only those who might wander from the right path. Here we might have the idea that all is orderly in the upper kosmos, but in the lower ouranos things are sometimes irregular. Note that all MSS have \"they fly with their wings,\" but in the short tradition this reads like a fragment. 5 a. Slav, diriati normally means \"keep\" in the sense of \"hold.\" But MSD, vol. 1, p. 775 lists vladiti, praviti as meanings. Cf. SJS, vol. 1, p. 521. b. The word \"storehouses\" used in the title (khraniliite) is not the same as the word in the text (sukroviSte). Both come together in 5:1 in A U. c. A has khladnaa, U essentially the same. But B has golotnaja and so do V N (which, however, have vs. 1 after vs. 2). Hence \"cold\" in APOT, vol. 2, p. 433. Originally * kholdu, the form in A is Slav. (Russ. kholodnyi [as in B2]), but it is not used for one of the elements in the lists in biblical texts. Since A has golotnaja at 40:10 in agreement with other MSS, its variant at 5:1 must be second­ary. Slav, golotnaja corresponds to 4'frost.\" Cf. Ps 148:8. d. A and U have an identical dittography at this point. e. Presumably the subject is the snow and the frost, not the angels. On the verbs of motion, see n. b to ch. 4. Similar confusion occurs here. The variants represent two different ways of looking at the movement of the clouds. According to A, the elements first go in (vkhodjat) to the treasuries, and then go out (iskhodjat). But the relative adverb otnjuduie (or otkuduie—P's inferior reading) ap­plies to \"come out,\" but not to \"go out.\" So the translation \"into which they go\" (APOT, vol. 2, p. 433) is incorrect. The awkwardness of A's idiom could account for the inversion of the verbs in R P. J has gone one step further, reading \"go up and go in.\" Its first verb vuskodit corresponds also to V N (all singular). Hence 4'goes up\" (APOT, vol. 2, p. 433). The picture in R P is more like the way we view the rain cycle. The clouds first come out and then the water goes back in. In J the water goes up and goes back in. In V N, apparently, the clouds go up and come out. According to the Bible, the rain and snow come down from heaven and do not go back there (Isa 55:10). In the scheme of A U, the angels prepare the clouds and put them into the storehouse, ready to go out into the world."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"113   2 ENOCH   7:2   [A] 1 And they showed me there the treasuries of the snow and the cold, 2 terrible angels are guarding the treasuries. -And they showed me there those guarding the treasuries; {and they showed me there the treasuries} of the clouds, from which they .go in and come out. 1 And they showed me the treasuries of the dew, like olive oil.

Slav, uzniky (A, compare U) or uiiki (B), that is uiiniku = desmios; J P veryfniki, better veriini (R). The latter, attested in SRY (vol. 2, p. 89) but not in SJS, is probably East Slavic. Cf. uziliSt, uzilnicy uznici at 10:3. The term points to angels (desmophylaks). It does not seem to be Christian vocabulary for damned spirits in the eschatological sense. But is it Jewish? In any case, the imagery is that of fetters, not \"dungeons\" (APOT, vol. 2, p. 433). d. Slav, bljudomy, passive participle of bljusti (SJS, vol. 1, p. 117; SRY, vol. 1. p. 248; MSD, vol. 1, p. 121) = phylattein, phylassein. The passage resembles 2Pet 2:4 and Jude 6, but the correspondence of vocabulary is not complete enough to sustain a hypothesis of borrowing. Possible influence of Christian Scriptures on the transmission of 2En should be kept in mind as well. The longer and shorter MSS differ. The usual source of tima (J) is skotos (MSD sub tima). In J the adjective \"great\" modifies \"judgment,\" not \"day\" as in Jude; \"day\" is lacking in 2En; but elsewhere \"the day of the great judgment\" is found. Both recen­sions have more in common with Jude than with 2Pet. To put it another way, they have nothing that is in 2Pet that is not in Jude, and the siros of 2Pet has no counterpart in the other texts. And there is nothing in the short MSS that is not also in long ones, except the different word for \"prisoner,\" which does, however, bring in the idea of fetters (cf. Jude). The evidence is not clear-cut enough to permit the explanation that the long recension is an expansion of the short one under the influence of Jude. For even the short recension already has affinities with Jude. In fact, the only point at which the long recension and Jude agree against short MSS is in the word \"great,\" and even then the ideas are not quite the same, for Jude has \"great day,\" 2En J \"great judgment.\" Furthermore, and more seriously, \"great\" is found only in P— \"measureless\" is the better reading (all MSS); and 2En has the angels \"weeping,\" J, in addition, \"hanging\" and \"waiting.\" e. Without any modification, we cannot be cer­tain what visjasa means here. Visiti means either \"to depend upon\" or \"to be suspended.\" (On the possible \"wisdom\" link between these two mean­ings, see W. F. Arndt and F. W. Gingrich, A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament [Chi­cago, 1952] p. 451.) This verb is used of hanging (= crucifixion) in Lk 23:39; Acts 5:30; 10:39, and so describes suspension of an executed criminal (either in punishment or exposure), not of one awaiting sentence, as here. Has the idea come in from ApPet (7:22), which also has such things as \"darkness\" and the river of fire? At least the tradition is similar—but those are human sinners. Blasphemers are hung up by the tongue (ek tes glosses kremamenoi), loose women by the hair, fornicators by the penis (surely!—not \"thighs\" as in HSW, vol. 2, p. 673—for this is a Hebraism from raglayim, \"genitals\"). f.

The intensified prtstupiiniku is familiar, but the spelling points to the prefix zulo-, \"evil,\" rather than dzilo, \"very.\" The former follows the analogy of words intensified by blago-. \"good.\" Hence \"evil\" is adjectival; the compound does not mean \"those who turned aside to evil.\" h. The nuance of utvruideni is hard to establish (\"confined,\" Morfill, The Book of the Secrets of Enoch, p. 6: \"fastened,\" APOT, vol. 2, p. 433), for utviriati means \"support,\" \"strengthen.\" i. This detail is lacking in short MSS, although the relevant information is present in them at ch. 18. In 2En 18:7 all traditions state that these fallen angels are \"under the earth,\" a detail found also in lEn 10. (The second heaven in 2En is like the third heaven in ApPaul.) The scheme can be harmonized if the present location of fallen angels in the second heaven is temporary. After the judgment on \"the Lord's great day\" they will be consigned to a subterranean hell, anticipated in 2En 18:7. Cf. the conventional hell of 2En 40:13-42:2, occupied by damned humans. In 2En there seem to be four grades of evil angels: (1) their prince, Satanail, apparently in the fifth heaven with (2) the Watchers, who consorted with women at Ermon; (3) the apostate angels of the second heaven; and (perhaps) (4) the ones condemned to be \"under the earth.\" The NT also knows of hosts of wicked in heavenly places. Even Origen did not succeed in categorizing the various species of fallen angels. Two principles operate oppositely. On the one hand, since the worst is the corruption of the best, the depth of all is proportional to original rank. Satan was one of the highest archangels; the Watchers, who commit the vile sins of Gen 6, become devils; the minor angels, who merely follow, become demons. But in 2En the heavens are in an ascending scale, and the wicked angels in the fifth heaven are worse than those in the second. The characterization of the latter is vague. They evidently hope for salvation; they arouse Enoch's compassion. They request him to pray for them. This is not dismissed as impossible because their doom is inevitable. Rather he excuses himself with evasive replies: He is a man; he doesn't know where he is going; he doesn't have anyone to pray for him. Enoch's visit to the second heaven ends on this vague note. j.

It is across the ocean (77:3) \"at the extremities of the earth\" (106:7-8). This sounds more like the place where Gilgamesh goes to consult Utnapishtim. This is where Enoch himself eventually goes (lEn 60:8), and presumably the paradise to which Michael took Melkizedek in 2En 72:9. This is where Methuselah and Noah go to consult Enoch (lEn 65:2). Paradise is differently located in other parts of lEn. In chs. 37-71 he goes to the west (52:1), \"to the extremity of the skies\" (39:3). But in 70:1-4 he goes northwest. In the mythological journey of Enoch in lEn 17f., 23-25, Paradise is a marvelous garden to the northwest, near the divine mountain. It has the tree of life, and rivers come from it. c. The Persian loan word has passed into many languages as a proper noun, Paradise. Originally Eden was the location of the garden, and Sumerian Edin means \"steppe.\" Domestication into Heb. produced the etymology \"pleasant.\" Hence janndt 'an-noiim or janndt 'adn in the Koran, and the adjective blag- in 2En. The designation of the heavenly paradise (jannd 'dliyd) as \"the garden of Eden\" is a Jewish rather than a Christian tradition (Palache 1920). On the other hand, the transformation to Edem is LXX, while Edom is the Eth. term. 2En uses the term \"garden\" (= gan) only occasionally; but the connection is still there, especially in the emphasis on trees and fragrances. d. A U read nevidimo. Other MSS (of several families) agree in nesuvidimo. The reading of A U could be an error, influenced by the following vidinija (all MSS of the shorter recension), whereas J etc. have vidtkhii, \"I saw.\" This emphasis on seeing throws doubt on A U's statement that Paradise has never been seen, unless it means that it was not like anything seen on the earth (3:3; 7:2). SJS gives a range of meanings for nesuvi-domu, including \"indescribable.\" e. P alone reads zrikhu, \"I beheld,\" against zrilu (A and the rest), \"ripe.\" f. The tradition of Gen 3:8. But here it sounds like a continual practice, since this Paradise is part of the heavenly complex. Ezek 28:13 calls Eden \"the garden of God,\" and Gen 13:10 knows about \"Yahweh's garden,\" which is the ultimate in fertility and prosperity. g. The reading viiskhoditi of J P R V N contrasts with vkhoditi of B B2 and is more difficult. U reads erroneously khvoditi. A reads khoditu, a secondary simplification (?). There is a similar difficulty in describing the movement of the clouds in 5:2. The idea of the LORD \"ascending\" into Paradise is incongruous with his usual location in the seventh heaven. Viiskhoditi is the standard translation of anabainein; voskhoidenije, \"the rising (of the sun)\" is a characteristic derivative. The idea of return to origins or periodic return could be present. h.

It is hard to get the picture. Perhaps •'extrem­ity\" is meant as in lEn 106:7f. Normally iskhodu (= exodus) means \"going out\" in the verbal rather than the substantive sense. I have not been able to find any equivalent of the phrase \"the exodus of the earth.\" There is one clue, however. By a series of associations iskhodu can refer to the place where the sun rises (mosa). In Ps 75:7 (= 74.7), for instance, the MSS vary among iskhodu vtlskodu vlstaka (= east). This agrees with 2En 42:4 (J). These details are lacking in A etc., both in ch. 8 and in ch. 42. Either a scribe has added them to an original resembling A, not worrying about the inconsistency in the location: or else a scribe has removed them from a MS like J in order to alleviate the inconsistency. The position of the reference to the four rivers in 8:2 (A) seems awkward, since it interrupts the description of the fruitfulness of the trees. The description of Paradise in ch. 42 in A etc. seems rather vague contrasted with the details in the longer MSS. The notice about the olive tree (8:5, A etc.) seems unnecessary after the remark that the garden contains every kind of fruit tree. It seems to be debris from J's fuller account of the four rivers. 1. While this might suggest that Paradise is in a zone between heaven (incorruptible) and earth (corruptible), another explanation is possible. An­cient astronomy distinguished between kosmos, where order prevailed, and ouranos, where things were more irregular, or, at least, where change was possible. If, in the cosmology of 2En, heavens 1 and 2 are the region of change, and heavens 4-7 are changeless. Paradise, in the third heaven, is in between. But since there are fallen angels in both the second and the fifth heaven, and both good and bad human beings in the third heaven, this Paradise is not between two clearly defined levels of good and evil. The concept of \"corrupt­ible\" does not seem to be moral. The words tilinije and netlenije translate to phtharton and aphtharsia in ICor 15:53. The apostle switches from concrete to abstract, a fine but important point. The corruptible does not become incorruptible, it puts on incorruptibility. m. P's reading niskhodjatu, \"descend,\" is sec­ondary and inferior. P has also lost by homoeotel-euton the words \"and they divide themselves into 40 parts and proceed.\" In the next verse it has lost the words \"and every tree is well fruited and every place\" by the same process. It has also lost the adjective \"atmospheric.\" n. As a gloss, this seems to be unmotivated. Is it a reminiscence of the \"Spring of 40,\" Nebcfel'Arbain, between Byblos and Baalbek, a notorious cult center in antiquity? The spring at Pella of the Decapolis is called 'Urn 'Arbain, \"mother of forty (outlets?).\" o. \"God.\" A U. All other MSS have \"LORD.\" p. Plural; i.e. every day, but also for the whole of every day. 9 a. J agrees with P in having a new ch. begin at this unsuitable point. There is no break in A. b. This ch. has notable affinities with Mt 25:31-46: (1) the designation \"righteous\"; (2) the idea of a \"prepared\" place; (3) the ethical measures; (4) the arrangement of the virtuous actions in pairs.

With never-ceasing voice and pleasant singing they worship God° throughout the whole day.p And I said, \"How very pleasant is this place!\" The men answered me: \"This place has been prepared, Enoch, for the righteous, who suffer every kind of tribulation in this life and who afflict their souls, and who avert their eyes from injustice, and who carry out righteous judgment, to give bread to the hungry, and to cover the naked with clothing, and to lift up the fallen, Isa 33:15; Ps 119:37 E/.ck 18:7; Isa 58:7; Mt 25:35. 37; 4 E/ra 2:20; Tob4:l6 Isa 1:17; Jcr 22:3 the capital one that the Son of Man is the Judge: (1) the setting is quite different; (2) the good deeds in Mt are exclusively humanitarian, whereas 2En has religious duties and the endurance of persecu­tion; (3) in fact there are only two in common— relieving hunger and nakedness. The community which used 2En 9 as its code was more self­consciously pious than the community of Mt 25. Its simple ethical monotheism would fit ''God-fearers1' anywhere; and it underscores 2En's con­stant theme—exclusive worship of the LORD as the only God. c. The longer version is more orderly than the shorter: but most of the differences seem to be due to simplification of the original rhetoric or the addition of homiletical glosses. Thus the block of humane acts in the middle are stated with infinitives in A. These have been extended to the following injunctions in V, but in J all but the first have been normalized to relative clauses. This process is complete in P; but R retains the pattern of A U. The importance of this doubtless more authentic arrangement is that these four practices define what is meant by \"righteous judgment.\" The absence of \"and\" in A U V N confirms this. Other stylistic changes include: 1. Movement of \"Enoch,\" since the vocative is delayed (V N agree with R J P in putting it earlier). In B it even occurs twice: mesto ce, junose, predivnymu i enokhu ugotovanno esti. The variant \"youth\" occurs in B again in the matching state­ment in 10:4. Note also B's careless error in reading pravednikomu (4 * righteous\") as predivnymu (4' mar­velous\"); and the dative enokhu leads to an incon­gruous result: \"This place has been prepared for the righteous (and for) Enoch.\" But A U also have the apparent dative. 2. Rearranging clauses so that the verb comes first; thus R J P all have \"before the face of the Lord\" after \"walk\"; but P alone has moved \"naked\" to follow \"clothe.\" Note that the con­struction \"has been prepared,\" behind which a Gk. perfect participle probably lies, bothered the scribes. Glosses include the addition of \"every kind\" to \"calamity\" (R J P), the addition of the words \"and [not P, hence the translation (A) in APOT, vol. 2, p. 434] orphans\" to \"injured\" (J R); the addition of \"without a defect\" to \"walk\" (R J P). V N have expanded \"and naked cover with a garment\" (in which A U agree with R J) to \"and the naked dress and cover with a garment\" (hence the translation [B] in APOT, vol. 2, p. 434). It can be seen from this that both MSS used in APOT represent extreme deviations from the main line. Minor variations include the change of \"this life\" (iitii semu [AJ) to \"their life\" (svoemi—V as well as J R; the phrase is missing from P). Also V reads zivotd. A U lack the word \"place\" at the end, but since it is present in V N, this is a blemish in A U. P gives a unique theological twist to the second point by reading \"from those who afflict\" instead of \"and who afflict\" (compare APOT, vol. 2, p. 434). This moves away from the idea, in all other MSS, that self-inflicted sufferings are meri­torious. d. The same word is used for the place of torment (10:4) and also the place of judgment (49:2). e.

Cf. Mt 25:34. 2En seems to be an independent treatment of this theme which in the Gospel has been radically Christianized. It is not likely that 2En 9 is a de-Christianized version of Mt 25. If the author of 2En knew Mt 25, we would have expected more specific resemblances. 10 a. The Essenes believed that Paradise was in the north. The reading in J P R (stranu = storonu) has the same ambivalence as Heb. gebul, \"bound­ary\" or \"region.\" In modern Russian this has become differentiated into strana, \"country,\" and storona, \"side,\" and hence \"side\" {APOT, vol. 2, p. 435). But earlier they were mere variants, both covering all these meanings. Original khora (?). b. J P R agree against the other MSS in the adjectives added to \"darkness\" and \"gloom.\" c. Instead of \"a black fire . . . with a river of fire,\" in which both long and short MSS agree, V N read \"fire and flame and blackness.\" d. P's variant prisno is merely a synonym. e. The \"river of fire\" is first met in Dan 7:10. The imagery of a volcano is present as \"the lake of fire\" in Rev 19:20: 20:10, 14f.;21:8. 1 En 14:19 is still like Dan, while in 2En the fiery stream is not yet the place and means of punishment as in Rev. Compare SibOr 2.196-200: 252f.; 286; 3.84; 8.411; ApPet 8; ApPaul. Phillip prays before his martyrdom to be delivered from \"the waters of fire\" {ANT, p. 450), but this could come from Rev. f. In I En 14:3 the house of God is \"hot as fire and cold as ice.\" In 2En God is compared to blazing fire. The idea that \"the soul is a cold element\" is found in Aristotle (Deanima 1.2.405b). Origen (On First Principles 2.8.3), struggling to establish the meaning of the word \"soul\" by etymology, speculates that a fall from virtue is a cooling of ardor for God, so cold is the natural state of evil things. The Second Council of Con­stantinople condemned the opinion (attributed to Origen) that demons have \"cold and murky bodies\" as a result of sin. g. Other MSS do not confirm the \"and\" in P which gave \"frost and ice\" in APOT, vol. 2, p. 435. h. For P's nouns (\"thirst and shivering\" [APOT, vol. 2, p. 435]), J and R agree in using verbs. Because of its agreement with P, we have adopted R's order rather than J's. The rhyme zebet (zjabti), iezet (zazdati) explains the spelling, in which J and R agree. This cold heat in one action parches and chills. i. We prefer other short MSS, e.g. / mudeste (V), to A U imuste, \"having,\" which is clearly an error. j. The remarkable reading yunoSe, clearly legible in A, supports the evidence of V, which has this variant four times (not here), and of other MSS, that there was a tradition in which Enoch was addressed in this way. The similarity to the vocative enoSe might explain the variant as purely scribal slip. But it is surprising that it is only in address, never in description, that the term is used. The variant jenokhu is rare. There is no phonetic reason"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"why the first vowel should change to ju; *junokhu is never found.

The vices for which the wicked are in the place of torture are not simply the opposite of the virtues in ch. 9, nor corresponding sins of omission, except for starving the hungry, stripping the des­titute naked, and idolatry. Even so the schemes are compatible, at least when the glosses are removed; but here the black arts are forbidden. The more specific Jewish duties*—circumcision, sabbath-keeping, food taboos, sex taboos (as distinct from fornication and deviant practices)—are not listed. There is nothing here that any god-fearer, Jew or Christian, would not affirm. I. The reference to sodomy is found only in P, which has similar additions in ch. 34. On prokhodu - otverstie (\"aperture\") see MSD, vol. 2, p. 1604. Slav, zadneprokhodnoe onerstie = \"anus.\" m. V N agree with J P R as reading obajanije, which means \"magic\" or more precisely \"sor­cery.\" The reading of A U (obaienija, \"calum­nies\") is inferior. n. The list of vices at the end of vs. 4 is found only in P. o. The reference is quite obscure, and J P R do not have it. Elsewhere the yoke is a symbol of accepting God's authority. See the n. on 34:1. In a context which is talking about fraud, the sin could be tampering with the scales. See 44:5; zugos could be mirilo. There could be a confusion in the verbs. Is it riSati or riSitil The latter, indicated by rHeti (V) {MSD, vol. 3, p. 227), means \"unbind, untie.\" But r&Satu (A U) can refer to some of the worst sacrilege, such as taking away from the newly baptized the baptismal robe and washing that part of the body which had been anointed with the holy oil. The word is used like this in the Sermon on the Cross in the Dubensky Sbornik. It describes in terms of the utmost abhorrence something \"un-thinkably evil\" that is done to the cross. If the \"yoke\" does not point to dishonesty in the use of scales, but rather to the violation of a sacred moral obligation, then we have no idea what it might be referring to. p. There is a discrepancy between the two recensions, and considerable difference in word order. J P R say they are \"able to supply suste­nance\"; but A U B read \"not able\" (twice in A U, once only in B). Here V and N agree with longer MSS, although V reads nakrimity (a syn­onym of nasytiti, in which other MSS agree). P's solitary reading gladnija makes \"the empty\" the object of \"satisfy,\" but gladom, \"hunger,\" of J R, as well as the different word order of other MSS, shows that this is instrumental with \"kill.\" Two distinct words are used here, each of which can render limos—gladu or alutf (f. aluda). Either alduStija or gladnija can mean \"starvation.\" The coexistence of the synonyms in all MSS shows that such pairs do not necessarily contract dialects or traditions.

R P agree with other MSS in reading \"gods.\" The gloss \"which can neither see nor hear\" only in J P. The epithet istukanny {glyptoi) only in P. r. Slav, dostoanie. Contrast nasle'de, \"inherit­ance\" (9:1). Both words are used in the Gospels to translate kleronomia. 11 a. At this point A has D (=4) NBO (= heaven) in the margin in huge letters. In the text the MSS vary between the numeral (e.g. A) and the word (e.g. U). b. The opening statement illustrates the kind of variation that takes place continually in these MSS. Most MSS have two verbs (in V they are vtizdvy-gnusta and viiznesosta, cf. N B etc.; in J vuzjasta and vozvedoSu, cf. P R), but A U have only vozdvigosta, a simple case of loss by homoioarkton. c. It is not clear what astronomical realities are meant by prikhoidenia, \"transitions.\" A U have probably simplified the text for this reason. By omitting \"and\" P arrives at \"successive goings,\" but it reads predkhodnaja. Perhaps the original was a hendiadys. d. The hesitation of scribes over the use of synonyms is illustrated at this point. Gk. is partic­ularly rich in words for \"light.\" Slav, has luca (best aktis) or sve'tu (best phos, opposite of \"dark­ness\"). But the latter also has the wider meaning of \"world,\" \"life,\" \"age\" Coldm, aidri). Here both are used in MSS of several families, but it is a question whether \"rays of light\" is glossed or whether \"rays\" (A U B) represents a simplification. In what follows sve'tu is used by all. Another confusion arises in the word for \"moon.\" Short MSS have nouns, \"sun and moon\"; long ones have switched to adjectives, \"solar and lunar.\" The apparently original mca (mesjaci) developed into \"month,\" while the synonym luna remains \"moon.\" R still has misjadnago but J P have lunnago. The secondary character of the readings with lun- is proved by the error in A U in vs. 2— \"greater than the sun (!)\"—it should be \"moon\"; and mt?a, as read by R and by all short MSS except A U, explains the other readings. In J P it has been replaced by its synonym luny; while slnca (A U) is a misreading of the identical ending, a mistake not so easily made with luny. The idea seems to be an exegetical inference from Isa 30:26: see also 2En 66:7f. e. The textual problems at this point may be illustrated by a few representative readings: g A km ea i kolesnica R krugi eju i kolesnicja eju g J P kru emu i kolisi emu g V / kru eju kolesnyca The picture seems to be that of a circuit (krugu = kyklos) around which the sun and the moon drive their chariots. That both heavenly bodies are in mind is shown by kozdo eju, \"each of the two of them,\" which follows, and which the agreement of R V A proves to be superior. J P read \"always.\" By the same token, R V, which read \"their (dual) circle,\" are better than A U B2 (\"her\") or J P B Chr (\"his\"). The grouping of both long and short MSS on both sides suggests that similar errors have developed independently. The feminine pronoun of A U is unaccountable, unless by simple error for the dual, since sulnce is neuter in Slav. But \"moon\" is feminine; see ch. 16. In any case the singular shows that J P are already talking only about the sun at this point. J's replacement of \"chariot\" by \"wheels\" (kolo, koleso also means \"circle\" and so is a near synonym of krugu) could be deliberate demythologization, since it occurs again in ch. 14; but most of the picture is still intact. In 11:2, 4, J P read kolo against kolesnica of other MSS, and this is probably intended as a synonym, since kola can also translate hamaksa. In 2En 16 krugu seems to mean \"cycle\" (of day and night), but there A U (not long MSS) retain the discussion of the moon's chariot. At 12:2 short MSS and R (but not J P) describe the angels \"who pull the chariot of the sun,\" which is more concrete than J P. See the next n."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"[A] 6 to supply clothing, take away the last garment of the naked; «who do not acknowledge their Creator, but bow down to  vain gods, constructing images, and bowing down to something made by hand— And for all these this place has been prepared as an eternal reward.\" 11 1 And (|the men|) lifted me up from there (|and they carried me up|) to the 4th heaven.

By changing the original ezditii, \"drives,\" to Sestvueti, 4'moves,\" J P have diminished the myth­ological content. At the end of vs. 2, J P have nouns where other MSS have verbs. A similar adjustment has been made in 12:2, where the verb mudet (vehunt)—original as R's agreement with short MSS shows—has become \"accompany and run\" in J P, which lack the reference to the chariot as well. This is the more remarkable, because otherwise long MSS have (retain?) mythological details lacking (censored?) in short MSS. g. Once more the singular emu, \"to him\" (of J P), contrasts with the better dual (ima) of all other MSS. This seems to contradict the statement in 24:5 that \"the sun has rest.\" It could mean no more than that he never stops moving; but in view of gnostic interest in \"rest\" something more sig­nificant could be involved. It suggests that \"the Sun\" is a self-conscious being. It is difficult to establish from the descriptions of the sun, moon, and stars in these sections whether they are imagined to be living celestial beings or not. The vivid dramatic descriptions of their move­ments could be no more than personification for literary purposes. The strictly mechanical timetable does not suggest free rational beings (Origen equates freedom and rationality). The accompanying angels serve as the rational causes of the regular motions, the theological equivalents of 44natural laws.\" Origen, assuming that all creatures are capable of development, and therefore of good and evil, does not exempt the heavenly bodies from this rule. Almost the whole of On First Principles 1.7 is devoted to the idea that the heavenly stars are souls in fiery bodies. He quotes Job 25:5 as a proof that stars can be tainted with sin (On First Principles 1.7.2). Belief that the stars are living beings goes back to the old polytheism, and retains sophisticated expression by Plato, who called the stars 4'divine\" (Timaeus 30b). Philo (De mundi opif.) taught that the stars, being heavenly beings, were incapable of defection. (See our discussion of \"incorruptible\" in the n. on 8:5 above.) Origen's other opinion (cf. Jude 13) arises from a priori notions, and an angels irresistible desire to systematize. There is no doubt that he thought that the sun, moon, and stars were rational beings (compare Contra Celsum 5.11). His main argument is the mere fact of their movement as such. This is supported by Scriptures in which commands are addressed to stars as if to responsible beings. But he had it both ways: The very precision of their movements is seen as proof of the highest reason (On First Principles 1.7.3). 2En is on a much lower level of sophistication. It is content to describe the movement of sun and moon in terms of calendrical facts, with a little cosmology, or rather astronomy, about gates. The angels are the causes. The mechanism of locomo­tion, whether on wheels or in a chariot or on a circular orbit, is not clear. But in any case it is fairly crude in conceptuality. Origen's views on this subject were attacked with vigor by Jerome and Justinian, and belief that the sun, moon, and stars were living beings became unorthodox. Since 2En decribes Sun and Moon at least in such a mythological way, its use in Christian circles could signify either (1) agreement with Origen against Jerome on this point; or (2) accept­ance of 2En at a time after the controversy was forgotten; or (3) innocuous use of fairy-tale ways of talking about the sun and the moon. h. The picture does not suit a quadriga, tradi­tional for sun deities, for here there are four stars on each side of the chariot, making eight in all. All long MSS have the additional feature of one thousand angels for each of these eight. In short MSS these verses have been drastically condensed by removing the extravagant figures, or else J P have been embellished. R is different again. It agrees at vs. 3 that each of the eight stars has one thousand stars under it. It continues: 4'And 15 myriad angels conduct him in the daytime, but at night a thousand angels, each angel with six wings, who go in front of the chariot, and one hundred angels give him fire.\" In J P the verbs seem to be singular, with the sun as subject. The sun enkindles and sets on fire (the words are synonyms) the one hundred angels.

The divergences in the MS evidence for this ch. cannot be described simply by reference to long and short recensions; for there are substantial differences within these two main kinds of text. The short MSS are brief and scrappy to the point of incoherence. They leave unclear such questions concerning the celestial birds as: (1) Their relation to the \"stars\" that go with the sun in ch. 11 (the continuity of short MSS at this point suggests that they are the same, in fact they are called \"angels,\" and the talk to the contrary in long MSS, which is all about phoenixes and the khalkedras, is lacking). (2) Their number (the repetition of the numeral in V N B2 suggests that there are twelve of them, while R |short| has the unique detail that there are two). (3) Their anatomy (short MSS have only the detail of twelve wings each |all agree in this) whereas long MSS go into considerable detail; R says merely that one was like a phoenix, the other like a khalkedra, whereas J P identify them as these creatures). (4) Their function (they \"pull\" the chariot; the weakening of this to \"accompany\" in J P only is clearly secondary). (5) Their task in conveying heat and dew to the earth (obscure in all texts). (6) Their course (they descend to the earth in short MSS, they go around under the earth in long MSS, and this is probably the original picture). b. This terminology is a peculiarity of J P within the long recension. See la, n. n. c. The plural (also in 19:6—both recensions) is unexampled in all literature, and suggests ignorance of the ancient and widespread traditions about this bird which everywhere else is sui generis. Fur­thermore, here the role of the phoenix(es) as the bird of the sun is quite general. Charles (APOT, vol. 2, p. 436) claimed that Lactantius' knowledge of the phoenix is dependent on 2En. Van den Broek (The Myth of the Phoenix, trans. I. Seeger [Leiden, 1972] p. 285, n. 1) denies this, with good reason. Among many details, 2En evidently does not know about the rejuvenating immersion of the phoenix at sunrise. At the same time, van den Broek (Myth, p. 260) agrees with Charles to the extent of recognizing that 2En's ideas about the phoenix must have originated at Alexandria. d. These are brass serpents; they are associated with cherubim in lEn 20:7, compare 2En 19. In the description which follows, phoenixes and khal­kedras seem to be the same. e. P reads dudni, J studnyi, not \"cold\" (stu-denyi), nor \"shameful\" (studlnyi). The word in P's preface, prefudnykh, is even more secondary. f. Knowledge of the anatomy of phoenix or khalkedra gained from elsewhere cannot be used safely here, for there is no indication that the author of 2En knew any more than the names of these creatures. Nor does Ezek 1:5-11 solve the problem. R J P agree in the details, but each of the three uses the conjunction \"and\" differently. P (APOT, vol. 2, p. 436) suggests that feet and tails were leonine; but R (Vaillant, Secrets, p. 91) suggests that feet, tail, and head are crocodilian, so that the body is that of a lion. This is not strictly the meaning of obrazu, \"shape.\" g. R uses the words \"nine\" and \"hundred\"; J has the numeral 900; P has 900 and \"hundred.\" The value of the \"measure,\" me'ra, is not defined. In translation literature it is either metron or batos (\"volume\"); or yepah or bath in OT texts (both \"volume\"). The most obvious unit is the cubit, the unit in the Disputatio (hos apo pekhon ennea)."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"123 2 ENOCH [A] 13:2 2          Ps 110:3 with 12 wings like those of angels, who pull the chariot of the sun, carrying the dew and the heat, when the LORD gives the command to descend to the earth, 3 with the sun's rays. 13 1 And the men carried me away to the east of heaven.

The confusion could be due to a clash of models of the universe, either a series of horizontal levels or a set of spheres concentrically around the earth. Perhaps the two can be combined, with the seven \"circles\" in between an upper zone of light and a nether zone of darkness. In ch. 14 the sun travels from west to east under the earth in darkness every night. i. Cf. the heading of ch. 12 in P.

The Slav, word vrata has no singular. In the oldest Mesopotamian traditions SamaS comes out through a gate in the east. In Parmenides' poem On Nature the gates of the sun, which are described quite literally, are opened by Justice, holder of the keys of retribution. The adjective \"solar\" modifying \"gates\" is found only in J P. 3Bar has 365 gates in heaven by which the sun rises. d. The MSS use a variety of verbs to describe the sun's egress at its rising. e. MSS with the adjective are better. As a modifier of vrimja, ustavlnyi has the idea of divine ordering. It translates horismenos, which in lClem 20:3 describes the appointed courses along which the heavenly bodies \"roll.\" f. Since 2En is not specifically interested in the phases of the moon as an astronomical phenome­non, what is meant here is probably the annual round of months (cf. ch. 16, n. e). The MSS agree in general, but fluctuate between singular (which suggests the moon [Vaillant, Secrets, p. 131) or plural (which suggests the months). That an annual cycle is in mind is shown by the following remarks about the shortening of the days (short MSS), and by the phrase \"the entire year.\" But the latter is not present in V, which reads i po obikhozdeniemi s mca vcego, \"according to the round of every month.\" V is also superior to A in what follow?;— \"and after shortening to (!) lengthening of days and nights.'' The correct udlizeniju of V has become prikhozdeniju, which really means \"arrival.\" It has been influenced by the preceding obkhozdeniemi metsjaca. B Chr read ulozeniju, \"diminution.\" Long MSS support \"day and night.\" Before re­jecting the reference to the sundial (all long MSS), note its occurrence in short MSS at 15:3. g. R says that the gates were \"big,\" once more in significant agreement with V and N. All MSS agree in its occurrence in 14:1. It could mean \"wide\" or \"tall.\" The same applies to the noun velikota, \"bigness,\" which follows. At this point all MSS seem to be corrupt; at least it is not possible to work out what the dimensions of the gates were in the source documents. It is more probable that the measure is the width, not the distance away (Vaillant). We are to imagine six openings along the eastern horizon (perhaps an actual structure), which, when viewed from the proper point, make the place of sunrise move one stadium (or two) each day.

It is easy to see how vuskhodit, \"as­cend,\" has crept in. The same split occurs in vs. 5 between R and J P. That is, A U are wrong in vs. 3; J P are wrong in vs. 3 (they are defective in vs. 5). The scribes were looking at sunrise from the human point of view; but the originals describe it from the sun's point of view. He \"goes out\" in the morning and \"goes in\" at night. In ch. 14 a different verb again, zakhodit, describes sunset. i. Does this refer to the equinox? The reference to the four seasons (vs. 5) suggests that the year might begin on such a date, but the picture of the sun rising through successive gates and then work­ing his way back through them suggests the move­ment of the point of sunrise across the horizon from solstice to solstice. j. Most MSS are defective in the full details of the ten periods spent in the six gates each year. But the complete agreement of R (long) with A U (short), not only in the full list, but also in the number of days, proves their authenticity. Their correlation either with a working calendar or with astronomical facts is another matter. A scheme of this kind is not known elsewhere; but the system of gates is familiar from lEn, including the astro­nomical sections of the Aram, fragments from Qumran. The 364-day year is a certain link with these old treatises. 2En 13 is either another solar scheme that has survived, or else a garbled relic. 14 a.

B has a similar reading at 16:8. At 70:1 similar confusion among numerals can be explained in terms of Glagolitic originals. c. The singular, \"the day,\" in A U, which is confirmed by B and V, is important evidence against the reading of J PR, in which the length of the year according to the Julian calendar is evidently a gloss. The figure is purely theoretical. What is being said is that the place where the sun sets in the west matches the place where it rises in the east, depending on the count of the day concerned. V is different. Instead of \"corresponding to the circuit [obkhodu] of the eastern gates\" in which MSS of both recensions agree, it reads \"corre­sponding to the eastern entrance\" (vikhodu—a word which comes a little later in other MSS). And it agrees with J R (against other MSS) in reading \"which it sets there,\" a palpable Hebraism (tu = Sam). Where others have \"rising\" (vkhodu = entrance), it has \"ascent\" (viskhodu). In vs. 3, instead of \"travels\" (ide[t]), it has \"goes out\" (izydetf). d. The following information, found only in MSS of the longer recension, is probably interpo­lated and cannot be used to date the main texts. (1) The Julian year of 365* days (14:1; cf. 16:4 and 16:6). (2) The calendrical cycle of twenty-eight years (15:4) when all the days of the month fall again on the same day of the week. (3) The Metonic cycle of nineteen years during which seven lunar months must be intercalated (16:8). (4) The lunar epacts (16:5) because twelve lunar months fall short of one solar year by about twelve days. The lunar epacts are first named in a Lat. treatise on the computation of Easter, dated A.D. 243. (5) The great cycle of 532 years (28 x 19) after which all movable ecclesiastical festivals come on the same day of the month and the same day of the week (16:5). e. J has developed a different picture, seeing sunset (in the west, as described by all other MSS) as a return to the eastern gates.

This is true also of figures associated with the sun, such as the phoenix. There is no indication that this use of 7 is any more than another occurrence of this sacred mystical or magical number. Nor is it invariant as a sun symbol, at least so far as coronal rays are concerned. Numbers 4, 5, 6, 9, and 12 are also found. g. P reads \"in heaven with the LORD.\" The brevity and obscurity of A U suggest that the text has been abbreviated by removing some of the more fantastic features. R differs considerably from J P in this ch.; but either or both might well preserve readings with a claim to authenticity. Since even A U describe the removal of the sun's crown at sunset, its replacement before sunrise is to be expected. We have presented all the evidence by conflating R's peculiar readings with the text of J. This does not mean that the textual problems are to be solved by such a maximizing procedure. In particular our interpretation of J's unique provide is dubious. See n. i. h. The sun has daily turning points (tropai) if the movement is considered to be back and forth. There are also seasonal tropai corresponding to the solstices. i. R says that \"the 4 hundred angels bring (prinoset) the crown and crown him.\" P has the similar privoditu, suggesting that J {provide) is an error. 15 a. The expected ch. enumeration of P (\"word 414' \") is missing. This shows that these headings were copied from another MS, and not made up just for P. b. The superior reading of R avoids the plural. c. The MSS vary extensively in the word used here and in 16:1, 8.

There are three or four terms, variously spelled. Longer MSS read rasditanie throughout, except that P alone deviates to rastedenie in ch. 16—hence \"course\" (APOT, vol. 2, p. 438)."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"and they place the crown on him there. 15 i 2 3 And they showed me this augmentation of the sun and the gates by which he goes in and goes out; for these gates the LORD created to be an annual horologe. 16 But the moon has a different augmentation.

This is the source of \"disposi­tion\" in APOT (vol. 2, p. 438), but \"order\" or \"routine\" would be better, and suits. The fact that diataksis or diatage could lie behind this word makes comparison with Acts 7:53 interesting. The variant rastinenije is attested, and all the words in A U could be the same. But raStenie (auksesis), \"increase,\" is also suitable in an astronomical treatise. Vaillant's emendation to' 'deduction'' does not seem necessary. The variant of Chr—\"differ­ence,\" or \"separation,\" assuming that razludenija at 16:8 is not merely a scribal slip—has little claim to authenticity, but it does suggest that the text was not understood. d. The annual movement of the sun serves as a kind of cosmic clock. From the time of Hesiod a farmer's almanac took its date from the annual movement of the sun through the ecliptic. This is due to the fact that the sidereal day is slightly shorter (by about four minutes) than the solar day. This means that the stars gradually overtake and surpass the sun. Roughly this permits the year to be divided into intervals, depending on what stars the sun is near. The crudest system divides the zone into twelve zodiacs. The Egyptians recognized thirty-six constellations or decans of ten days each. By accurate observation of the risings (heliacal or acronycal) and settings (cosmical or heliacal) of individual stars, more exact indications are possi­ble. In 2En all the recensions agree in the idea that the gates through which the sun rises and sets keep track of the days of the year in the same way as a sundial keeps track of the hours of the day. J, R, and P go on to affirm that this is why the sun is the greatest created thing. This statement is lacking in A U, except for the words since skazaeti, \"the sun says,\" which are unintelligible. Yet something like them is found in other MSS. Even so, the divergence among the three MSS of the longer recension at this point leaves the whole matter obscure. J's \"heat,\" vari, is clearly a corruption of tvar, \"creature\" (P). This strong statement about the sun is intended to reinforce the adherence of this group to the solar calendar. e. A U share at this point the stray words since skazaeti. Other MSS have the same words in inverted order, as with skazuetu solnce (B). The corruption is irreparable. 16 a. See ch. 15, n. c.

Thus likewise by the western gates in accordance with the cycle, and in accordance with the number of the eastern gates. b. The picture is far from clear. There are twelve gates, each corresponding to one month of the solar year (but these months are not those of any known calendar). The disposition of the gates is not clear, whether \"to the east\" (A) or \"from the west to the east\" (J P). The movement of the moon is \"going in and going out\" through these gates. These gates are not the same as the gates of the sun—six in the east, six in the west—and the months connected with those gates are quite dif­ferent in their division of the year. A further problem is the apparent description of these gates as a \"crown.\" Parmenides conceived of the universe as a system of concentric rings of fire (cf. 2En 27:3), called stefanai. Is this word an intrusion of the word \"crown\" from the description of the sun? The word has a good claim to authenticity since A U read vinca. J P have the participle vgn'danfnja, from which R's vddnaa, \"eternal,\" is best explained as a corruption. Yet some short MSS also have this variant, e.g. V, identically vidnaa. Vaillant (Secrets, pp. 15f.) suspects that Ps 24 (Slav. 23):7. 9 with vrata vic*naja has contaminated the text. Vaillant emends the text extensively to arrive at twelve gates \"crowned\" in the east and twelve similar gates in the west. But the preposition ko, \"to,\" which persists in all MSS, is awkward, except in J P—\"from the west to the east.\" If we are to imagine a complete circlet (\"crown\") of gates \"from the west to the east,\" perhaps something like \"the houses of the zodiacs\" is in mind. But the language of vs. 3 suggests that there are two sets of gates, one set in the east, one set in the west, and that the moon behaves similarly in each set. This is the picture in lEn 72. J P clearly identify the first gate as \"western.\" \"in the place of the sun,\" the latter phrase being found in R as well. This is one of several details in which lEn can still be recognized behind 2En (e.g. lEn 73:4). But lEn (72:3) uses the same gates (six in the east, six in the west) to describe the movements of both sun and moon. lEn 75, however, describes a system of twelve gates in another connection, and this could be the source of 2En's muddled account. The presence of fragments of ideas from lEn in longer MSS, and their absence from shorter MSS, disproves the theory that longer MSS have been interpolated. Many differences can only be explained if the shorter MSS have been abbreviated. c. The designation of a month by a number rather than a name corresponds to Qumran practice. lEn and Jub similarly never use month names. Month names appear at 2En 48:2 and in chs. 68 and 73. d. Another problem is the number of days to be assigned to each of the twelve months. R is the only MS with twelve numbers intact and they add up to 363. These agree fairly well with other MSS where they have the numbers, notably with A U. In fact, if we prefer A to R at the one point where they disagree (31 days for the third month), and supply A with R's figure for the twelfth month (22 days—a figure confirmed by J), the total is 364, which is probably original. But the lengths of the months do not line up with any known calendar. The calendar in 16:2 according to the various MSS is as follows: lEn P J R A, U B Jub 1 (3)1 31 31 31 30 30 2 35 35 35 35 35 30 3 30 30 30 31 30 31 4 30 30 30 30 30 30 5 31 — 31 31 30 30 6 31 — 31 31 31 31 7 30 30 30 30 30 30 8 31 31 31 31 31 30 9 35 31 31 31 31 31 10 30 30 30 30 — 30 11 31 31 31 31 — 30 12 28 22 22 122] — 31 Total 373 363 [364] 364 The numerals in Vaillant (Secrets, pp. 15f.) correspond to U, except that month 12 is missing, and he has restored it (22 days) from R.

Besides the obvious correction of the first month from 1 to 31. they changed P's two 35-day months to 31 days each, thus secur­ing a total of 365 days. But even so, the series *31 *31 30 30 31 31 30 31 *31 30 31 28 does not match the Julian calendar, and 2En does not use a 365-day year in any case. J agrees with R as far as it goes, and both preserve the vital information about the twelfth month. When this is supplied to A U the correct total is obtained. R is the only MS with figures for twelve months but its total is wrong. R agrees with U at every point except in the third month, where its value (30 days) explains why it is one day short. A U are accordingly the best witnesses. B has only nine months and only six of them agree with A U. But its agreement that the second month has 35 days is important evidence. In fact all MSS agree with this infor­mation. e. The meaning of the adverbs used to charac­terize the behavior of the moon in each month is obscure. The discovery of the pattern is made harder by the wide disagreement among the MSS. Four different adverbs are used. Note the following translations: invistno, \"exactly\"; ispytno, \"accu­rately\" (\"perfectly\"?); izjastenu, \"exception­ally\"; izrjadenu, \"extraordinarily.\" The adverbs are altogether lacking in B. Only A U use all four. R has three; J P only two, with a marked trend to label most months \"exactly.\" This accounts for the two months (3 and 11) for which R J P agree together against A U. Note the following: Month A U  R  1 exactly exactly 2 exactly exactly 3 exceptionally exactly 4 exactly exactly 5 extraordinarily extraordinarily 6 exactly exactly 7 exactly exactly 8 extraordinarily extraordinarily 9 accurately accurately 10 exactly exactly 11 exceptionally exactly 12 exactly exactly Month J P 1 exactly exactly 2 exactly exactly 3 exactly exactly 4 exactly exactly 5 — exactly 6 — exactly 7 exactly exactly 8 extraordinarily extraordinarily 9 exactly exactly 10 exactly extraordinarily 11 exactly exactly 12 exactly exactly Otherwise R agrees with A U (against J P) where this leveling has not occurred (5, 9). All agree in labeling the eighth month \"extraordinarily.\" The textual evidence indicates that A U have the best readings. A clue is probably found in 16:6, which says that there are four \"extraordinary\" months each year. This has something to do with the waxing and waning of the moon in relation to the calendar months, although it is possible that the \"diminution\" and \"augmentation\" mentioned there refer to those periods of the year in which the days are getting shorter and longer. A U have lost some of the text at this point by homoioarkton, but restoration can be made from B. In J P R the scribes seem to have got the matter confused with the cycle of bisextile years. The calendar of lEn begins the year at the spring equinox, when day and night are equal and the days are getting longer.

And when they see any evil activity,  they put the commandments and instructions in order, and the sweet choral singing0 and every kind of glorious praise. These are the archangels who are over the angels; and they harmonize all existence, heavenly and earthly; and angels who are over seasons and years, and angels who are over rivers and the ocean, and angels who are over the fruits of the earth and over every kind of grass, and who give every kind of food to every kind of living thing; and angels who record all human souls, and all their deeds,d and their lives before the face of the LORD. e. Mount Hermon as the scene of this wickedness probably goes back to a polemic against the cult of Ba'al-Harmon. See my note in BASOR 198 (1970), 41. It probably has a reflex in the god Haram-bet- 'el of Elephantine. Vincent (La Religion Ties Judeo-arameens a Elephantine [Paris, 1937] pp. 593-621) draws attention to the motif of sexual relations between divine beings and women as a link between this cult and the use of the word \"Hermon\" in the Enoch corpus: \"II est vraisembl-able que si 1'auteur du livre d'Henoch a place cette scene du serment des anges sur le sommet de 1'Hermon, c'est precisement parce qu'une pratique de serment rituel avait rendu celui-ci celebre\" (p. 602). ^ f. A: na rami. lEn 6:6 says that the oath was sworn on the summit eis ten koryphen of Mount Hermon. B has the interesting reading na arame. There are many possible explanations of these variants. A major shift from the source in lEn is the inversion of the oath; originally the fallen angels swore to sin. Here \"they broke the promise.\" g. Since A and U confirm the reading \"under the earth\" found only hitherto in longer MSS (it is not in V N, hence lacking in Charles's B text in APOT), its genuineness cannot be doubted, al­though it simply does not fit the cosmography of the rest of the book, and even contradicts this very ch., which locates the other fallen angels in the second heaven.

Where longer MSS have (so)prilelozenia odezdi, or the like, shorter MSS present a variety of readings for the first word, some agreeing with those in J P R, some more abstract.

B tidenie; others khozdenie, \"movement,\" which is perhaps correct. Yet it is possible that we are here rather close to an astrology, grounded in polytheism. The parti­ciple kipjaStim (19:4) suggests growth if not birth. These angels, managers of seasonal fertility, are not far removed from the old nature gods, but acceptable to Jewish-Christian thought because they are now heavenly creatures, subservient to the will of the one true God. c. This motif, which derives from Isa 6, is common in the apocalypses. They differ widely in the location and scope of this music. In Ascenls it takes place in every heaven. According to Epistula Apostolorum 13 the angels perform the liturgy daily at \"the altar of the Father\" in the highest heaven. d. The task of these recording angels is carried out by Enoch himself, according to 2En 43; and 2En 65:4 suggests that God himself keeps a journal of every person's activities from birth to death. These records will be produced on judgment day (52:15; cf. 40:13).

Since the \"six-winged\" are seraphim in Isa 6, these, although not named as such, are probably intended here.

The main differences between the two re­censions in this ch. are undoubtedly the result of a revision that incorporated into the antecedent of longer MSS details about three more heavens which are incompatible with the scheme of seven heavens. Even so, the genuine Heb. words which occur in these interpolations show that they are not medieval Slav, notions. The full textual assessment is com­plicated by the differences between J, P, and R in these details. In addition to 20:3, these farther heavens are mentioned by longer MSS at 21:6— 22:1. At the other extreme, shorter MSS seem inco­herent, as if they have been mutilated. In particular, the tradition of ten ranks of angels in the seventh heaven with corresponding lists has a better claim to be authentic than the scheme of ten heavens, even though these details also are now found only in longer MSS.

Elsewhere the term \"rank\" {dinu) or \"order\" is used.

For the former see Maimonides, Mishneh Torah (S. 1); for the latter see below. Both Jewish and Christian lists vary extensively in both the identity and the hierarchical sequence of these ten (or nine). We cannot assume that chance lists are meant to give relative ranking. b.

Gabriel's role here resembles that of Michael in 22:6. In the earliest Jewish and Christian Mid­rashim on biblical themes there is a decided pref­erence for Michael as the Lord's chief executive officer—arkhistratig in 2En. Almost any unnamed angel in the Bible is likely to be identified with him. According to lQapGen (22:1, 2), the pdlit of Gen 14:13 who brought the report to Abraham was a shepherd whom Abraham had given to Lot. In other Midrashim it is King Og. According to PRE it was Michael. In ApAb it is Michael who conducts the patriarch to the gate of heaven; cf. the role of Michael in transporting Melkizedek in 2En 72 (longer MSS). In 3Bar Michael is the Mediator (cf. 2En 33:10) who conveys the prayers of the righteous to God and who takes back rewards to the faithful. And so on. In lEn it is Michael who does the honors, and even in 2En, Gabriel seems to have a lesser role, and is called merely \"one of his glorious ones,\" but longer MSS add \"archan­gel.\" In view of the popularity of the cult of Michael in the Christian East, his prominence in 2En does not help to settle the religious setting of this document. But \"Gabriel\" could come from a Christian hand, at least when he ousts Michael, as in A and U's variant readings in ch. 72. Gabriel as the Christian favorite is already competing for Michael's honors in Origen's claim that Gabriel supervises wars {On First Principles 1.8.1). f. In V Gabriel addresses Enoch as \"youth!\" g. MSS of both long and short traditions present the alternatives ouvy mni, \"Woe to me!\" (V N B2 J—oukhi of R is equivalent to ouvy) and vo nine*, \"in me\" (A U B P). The latter is meaningless, but should not be rejected as a corruption (Vaillant, Secrets, p. 22). It is undoubtedly authentic. Its association with \"my lord\" points to the Hebrew bi 'ddoni Cddondy). The exclamation bi, entreaty rather than dismay, is used twelve times in OT, always followed by \"my lord\" and nearly always speech initial. In the LXX Pentateuch it is translated deomai (plural Gen 43:20) but elsewhere by an absurd misunderstanding of bi, en emoi. This misunderstanding is found here in 2En. Either 2En has repeated the mistake of LXX (Heb. original) or it has reproduced a LXX text (Gk. original). False correction of \"in me\" to \"Woe to me\" followed inevitably within the Slav, transmission. h.

V N also go on to say that Enoch fell on his face and did not even look at the Lord. The survival of the same details in both recensions at 39:3 shows that the comparison with hot iron is original; but here (22:1) it is lacking in all shorter MSS. This shows that sometimes J P might be the only MSS preserving authentic readings. In contrast shorter MSS have moved toward more abstract ideas (e.g. \"the extent of the Lord's being\"), yet even here the MSS falter. A, for instance, seems to read iobijatu with an illegible letter, like fi, above the omega. The spelling of U suggests that an infinitive was intended, with the result \"who am I [or who is able] to describe the extent [amplexus] of the Lord's face as it is [suitee].\" The latter is the participle (used as an adjective meaning \"actual\"), whereas all longer MSS have sustestvo, \"being\" in the abstract sense of \"existence.\" Vaillant {Secrets, p. 26) restores suStie {ousia, substantia) as an intermediate reading. But it is more likely that behind this language lies mystical speculation about the physical size of God (see ch. 39). R is sufficiently distinct to be reproduced sepa­rately: \"And I saw the LORD in the face. And his face is strong and very glorious [here R agrees with A U], marvelous and supremely frightening [•uias-, where A U have straS-], terrible and horrifying [here R has pritranno, where J P have prestrasno].\" d. Cf. the face of fire seen by Jacob at the top of the ladder in LadJac. In the Book of John the Evangelist Satan's face becomes like heated iron. e. Longer MSS incline to \"the way of nega­tion.\" using neispovedimoe (three times in J P but also in A U at the end of vs. 3). Yet the emphasis is not that God is unknowable, or even inconceiv­able, but rather indescribable, and then, not because it is impossible, but because it is forbidden. The Slav, connotations of ispovedati are with eksomo-logein but neispovedimoe is closer to anekdiegetos. J R also have neobdtoe (\"not to be betrayed\"?) and P reads neizredennoe {afatos, anekfrastos). f. J P R agree in the reading mnogo-ucenii ego, \"his abundant knowledge\" {multum erudition). which is probably inferior to A U mnogo-ocnoe. The former is not suitable, since the connections of ucenie are with imparted teaching rather than inherent wisdom. Hence \"instructions\" (APOT. vol. 2, p. 443). But here the narrator has retreated, as biblical writers so often do, from describing God to depicting his splendid supernal setting (vs. 2). g. In V N the sequence of events is different: Vss. 8-10 come before vs. 5, and vs. 11 follows vs. 7 (see APOT B). h. The Lord's speech of welcome is identical in all MSS, except for the verb.

Slav, \"archistratig.\" Michael's military func­tions are anciently attested. In IQM he is the one who overthrows the Kittim. In spite of the title used in 2En, there are no combat motifs in this book. A U have replaced the title with \"great archangel.\" But arkhistratigu (J P R B V N B2) is certainly correct. A's variant comes from Dan 11:1 (ho aggelos ho megas), where the adjective is elative. making Michael at least an archangel, if not the senior one. j. This act of the Lord in consulting the heavenly assembly is very significant. But it is difficult to know where to place it in the history of ideas. The ancient Mesopotamians believed it was impossible for a human to gain permanent admittance to the community of divine beings. Gilgamesh is asked, Now who will call the gods for you to assembly, that you may find the life you are seeking (Gilgamesh U:\\97f.). The motif recurs in many stories of futile attempts of desperate or presumptuous mortals to scale the height of heaven, or of the achievement of a transient visit as the limit of possibility. The discussion in the divine assembly provides the starting point of many OT oracles, and prophets participate in some way, if only in a vision. The scene in 2En 22 retains quite a lot of this mythology. There is no real debate. The Lord makes a proposal and the angels concur. The verb iskusitiliskusati, found in both recensions, is strange, since it means \"test\" or \"tempt.\" The question is whether a human as such should be admitted or whether Enoch should become an angel. The sequel shows that it is the latter. Note the backdrop of Gilgamesh: When the gods created mankind death for mankind they set aside life in their own hands retaining (10.3:3-5). Ps 115:16 also affirms that Heaven belongs to Yahweh while he gave the earth to mankind. The inevitability of death is one thing; possible admittance to heaven after death is another. In the case of Enoch the impression is given that entrance to heaven is possible only if death is circumvented. On the other hand, the events in ch. 22 might secure a release from the body essentially the same as death. In Egyptian Christian tradition, as found in the History of Joseph the Carpenter (ch. 31), in order to stress the universality of death, Jesus teaches that even Enoch and Elijah will have to die in due course. Note the introductory comment to the extract from 2En in MPr, \"he is still alive.\" k. In a prayer to Boris and Gleb, the martyred princes, Yaroslav the Wise says, Blagodatiju ziva esta i gospodevi predustoita, \"By grace you (two) are alive, and stand in front of the Lord\" (Skazanie o Borise i Glebe). Note the contrast of the native idiom here with the Semitism in 2En—stoatiprddu lied Gi. The persistence of this simple but primitive and Hebraic anthropomorphism \"in front of the face of God\" is all the more striking since the movement to more abstract language is already in full swing in LXX. Thus Pss 17:15; 63:3 become in Gk. \"to appear before God\" (LXX 16:15; 62:3) instead of \"to see the face of God.\" 1. The state of the MSS at vs. 7 shows that the scribes, if not the angels, were embarrassed by the proposal. In short MSS the response is simple, \"Let him ascend,\" using the same word as the question. Longer MSS have become more cere­monial. But in J R the reply is ustupit. Since MSD (vol. 3, p. 1291) gives otstupit* as a meaning of ustupiti, P's reading (otstupit) could be no more than a gloss, although mistaken, since it seems to mean \"retreat\" or \"depart,\" \"withdraw,\" while da ustupit, \"let him keep away,\" or any other of its several meanings, does not fit since \"in accord­ance with your word\" implies acquiescence. m. The imagery of extracting a person from his garment is close to the terminology of Dan 7:15. \"my spirit was upset inside its sheath.\" The same idea is found in lQapGen 2:10, wnSmty Igw ndnh\\ \"and my breath within its sheath.\" Aram, neddn is a loan from Persian niddni, \"container.\" In 2En there is no explicit talk about soul and body. But the identification (or at least a simile) is made in the 1076 Sbornik (p. 237, 11. 5-6): tilo bo naSe jesti aky riza, \"for our body is like a garment.\" Enoch is not simply liberated from his \"clothing\"; he has to be clothed upon (2Cor 5:3). In Rev the saints wear white robes (Rev 6:11; 7:9, 13, 14); these are not identified as a transformed body, but they are white by virtue of Christ's atonement, a need not recognized in 2En. In the Chaldean oracles the soul, as it travels through the planetary spheres, puts on successive garments corresponding to the qualities of the stars. n. \"The clothes of my glory\" is a transparent Hebraism. o. There is not enough detail about this chrism to betray the influence of baptismal practice. The symbolism is compatible with Christian ritual, but"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"[A] brave, Enoch!

And the there is no washing. It is the effulgent oil that gives Enoch the radiant countenance, dangerous to human beholders. This motif seems to have been influenced by the legend of Moses, whose shining face was a reflection of God's magnificent glory. Philip, in his prayer before martyrdom, and evidently anticipating the heavenly condition (cf. Acts 6:15), says, \"Clothe me in thy glorious robe and thy seal of light that ever shineth\" (James, ANT, p. 450). Cf. Mt 13:43. Origen (On First Principles 2.3.7) speaks of the best and purest spirits, who must have some kind of body, being changed according to their degree of merit into an ethereal condition, and interprets \"change\" in ICor 15:52 as \"shining with light.\" p. At Qumran the souls of the righteous after death live with God \"like angels\" while the souls of the wicked go to join the spirits of Belial (1QS 4:6-8, 11-13; 1QM 12:1-7). This could indicate little more than their final location. The Christians resurrected are \"like the angels in heaven\" (Mt 22:30); but again this touches only the question of sexuality. Epiphanius' account of Ebionite Christology casts Christ in a role not unlike that of Enoch in 2En, although the latter does not use adoptionist termi­nology. Note the following: \"They say that he was not begotten of God the Father, but created as one of the archangels . . . that he rules over the angels and all the creatures of the Almighty\" (AdvHaer 30.16.4f.). It is not clear whether this act of \"creation\" explains the origination of Christ; but it does not say precisely that Christ was one of the originally created archangels, but made (to be) like one of them. Elsewhere in Ebionite teaching, according to the same Epiphanius, Jesus was con­stituted as Christ by the union of the Holy Spirit with the man. In any case the installation of Enoch does not seem to be contaminated at any point by Christian ascension doctrine. It is hard to tell how far 2En goes in the transmutation of a human to an angelic being. In the Christian synthesis with Gk. belief in the immortality of the soul as the main thing, the resurrection of the body dwindled in significance; at least the body was spiritualized so as to be hardly human any longer. This point could have been reached by Origen, although what he actually believed is hard to retrieve behind Rufinus' translation. To judge from the Gk. frag­ment preserved by Justinian (Ep. ad Mennam), Rufinus has accurately represented Origen's views in On First Principles 1.6.2. A righteous soul may merit \"the rank of angel.\" Jerome is, accordingly, probably perverse when he accuses Origen of \"mixing everything up\" (Ep. ad Avitum 3) by teaching \"that one who is now a man may in another world become a demon,\" while a demon may become a man or an angel. He does not specifically accuse Origen of teaching that a man may become an angel, but complains about the idea of changing an archangel into a devil. Here Jerome goes too far, for Origen is on safe scriptural ground. He has avoided the trap in his statement that \"the end is always like the beginning\" (1.6.2) because he has recoiled from the logical inference that God originally made demons as such and that they \"inherit this realm of darkness . . . from the necessity of their creation\" (1.5.3). On the con­trary, the differentiation in the hierarchy of moral beings is entirely due to the freedom of their rational natures. Origen falls back on the Bible when he expounds the fall of Lucifer (see also 1. Preface. 6). But he is in real difficulty by regarding all three species of rational creatures as having a common mode of being in moral freedom, espe­cially since he regards this as constitutionally all-important. For, placing man in between angel and demon, he sees him capable of improvement or deterioration. Having admitted the fall of Satan, he finds it hard to teach the indefectibility of the loyal angels. Having admitted that man may be restored to his former state, it is hard for him to exclude demons from the same possibility. Hence his alleged heresy that Satan would be saved. Enoch not only attains the rank (i.e. location and function) of an angel; he becomes like the members of the highest echelon in the seventh heaven. If Origen had known this tradition, it might have suited him to quote it. The problem seems to be behind the obscure language of 2En 31. It is not clear how much the events in 2En 18 imply the salvation of the angels in the fifth heaven. Those in the second heaven don't appear to have such a prospect; and all humans, blessed and cursed, are in between, in the third heaven. q. The emphasis is physical. His face is incan­descent (37:2); he has lost all desire for food (56:2), an effect ascribed directly to the oil of glory (but 42:5 speaks of feasting in eternal life); he does not seem to need sleep (23:3; cf. Rev 4:8); and there are statements elsewhere that suggest that he has become omniscient.

The name is otherwise unknown, and remains unexplained. As an archangel, he resembles Uriel, and the names are not unlike. As the scholar archangel, is Vrevoil modeled upon Thoth = Hermes = Mercury in the Egyptian-Phoenician tradition as reported by Sanchuniathon (Philo By-blos—Eusebius)? According to Diodorus, Thoth was scribe to Osiris, and tomb paintings often illustrate this. The tradition is that Sanchuniathon obtained his theology from the books of Thoth, just as Enoch got his from Vrevoil. Vrevoil's epithet here (swift in wisdom) agrees with Hermes' reputation for nimble wit. But the idea that a human learns the secrets of existence (or even acquires power) by gaining access to the heavenly tablets (of destiny) is an ancient one in Mesopotamia (the Adapa myth has much in common with the Enoch legends). And Eusebius connects Manetho's history with Th6(y)th, who inscribed it first on some pillars in the land of Sen ad, and after the cataclysm they were translated into Gk. s. The epithet reminds us of mahir, an epithet of the greatest scribes, beginning with Ezra. t. The apocryphal documents contain numerous references to books in heaven; these ideas evolved out of the OT. 23 a. The commencement of a new ch. here in longer MSS is not suitable. Other MSS do not provide a break when Vrevoil is introduced at 22:10. But A begins a new section in the middle of 23:1. b.

The term znamenia suggests that the copyist copied omen texts. f. Short MSS lack the details about human souls and their destinies. The phrase \"formation of the earth\" (zemlunago) is reminiscent of Mt 24:34, and could be a Christian gloss. But the passage implies the pre-existence as well as the predestin­ation of all souls. Even Adam existed before he was sent to the earth (ch. 32). A knowledgeable Christian scribe would recognize here the views of Origen on the subject condemned by the Second Council of Constantinople. That is, short MSS look more like orthodox censorship than long ones look like Christian interpolation. g.

The recensions divide consistently over the number of books produced, whether 360 (short MSS) or 366 (long). When Popov published the 1679 Poltava copy (P) in 1880, he searched for evidence of the earlier circulation of this hitherto unknown work. He found a book called \"Enoch\" mentioned in a list of \"disapproved\" (i.e. non-canonical) books in a I4th-cent.

There is a deviant Enoch tradition in the Book of St. John, allegedly Bogomil. In this work it is Satan who creates the world, and the angels who came to Enoch were his emissaries. They took him up into the firmament to behold his |Satan's| godhead. \"And he commanded pen and ink to be given him, and he sat down and wrote 67 books\" (James, ANT, p. 190). [A] LORD summoned Vereveil, one of his archangels, who was wise, 11 who records all the LORD'S deeds. #And the LORD said to Vereveil, \"Bring out the books from the storehouses, and give a pen to Enoch and read him the books.\" And Vereveil hurried and brought me the books mottled with myrrh.

Nothing is said about who is on the right-hand side. The position assigned to Enoch elsewhere is different: \"standing in front of the face of the Lord.\" b. This chapter heading, a rarity in A U, is in the text of A, followed by a large letter. A Gk. pi is in the margin of U. c. The genre of recasting a biblical story into autobiographical form is already present in the reminiscences of Wisdom in Prov 8. But Wisdom describes creation as carried out by God. God's own account is given by the author of Job 38. d. Cf. 40:3. In the NT the mystery that the angels are curious about is the Gospel. Here it is the story of creation. This is the only subject on which the Lord himself discourses to Enoch. Ac­cording to Epistula apostolorum (19) believers have privileges denied to angels. e. Vaillant's \"birth\" (Secrets, p. 29), which is not a suitable word for the origin of angels in any work remotely connected with the Bible, comes from a purely conjectural emendation, vustavlenija, behind which he sees anastasis. f. The texts of the two recensions are not the same at this vital point; but the picture is not altogether clear in either of them. Both agree (vs. 5) that creation arose from a restlessness or lack of equilibrium in God himself at the very first, in contrast to the stability of the sun's movement. J P R seem closer to the doctrine of creation ex nihilo than the others, since they say more abso­lutely \"I was (the only) One,\" whereas A U say \"like one (of them?).\" V is quite clear in its reading, \"like one of the invisible things.\" Even so, the impression remains that God was not the only existent being or thing from the very first, although each recension gives this impression in its own way. Both agree that God made the existent out of the non-existent, the visible out of the non-visible. So the invisible things coexisted with God before he began to make anything. (Contrast Chris­tian belief that God made all things visible and invisible.) Vs. 4 is quite explicit on this point: Before any of the visible things had come into existence, God was moving around among the invisible things. g. 2En's cosmology does not derive all existence from one original substance, such as water (Thales) or fire (Heraclitus), or a common indeterminate substance (Anaximander) or mist (Anaximenes); nor from four: fire, air, water, earth. Even so, an attempt is made to account for these elements, and the idea of mixture is present. But the biblical process of differentiation and separation is still recognized. Unlike the original, this version of Gen 1 gives prominence to fire, but it is quite derivative. Some other unidentified mythology is given more room than Gk. physics. Out of the original invisible things, God calls two beings: Adoil, from whom is born the great light, and Arukhas, from whom comes the darkness. Water is made by thickening a mixture of light and darkness. But light, if anything, is the great elemental substance. h. The primal restlessness of God contrasts with the main trends of philosophy, especially those of an absolute idealism, where by definition, God, the perfect being, knows no change, and, of course, has no needs. In gnostic thought, God is perfect rest, and to this restless souls may themselves attain. That God himself is seeking repose comes out already in Eccl. The restlessness of God is expressed in the age-long quest of Wisdom or of the Holy Spirit for a place of permanent rest. Eccl 24:7 represents Wisdom as seeking anapausis \"from generation to generation, passing into holy souls\""},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"[A] Ex 33:11 And the Lord called me; and he placed me to the left of himself closer than Gabriel.

And I thought up the idea of establishing a foundation, to create a visible creation. 25 Sir 42:17 (WisSol 7:27). Similarly, according to the Pseudo-Clement Homily III 20:2, the Kerygmata Petrou (a Jewish-Christian gnostic work) represents the pre-existent redeemer as spending the ages ' 'chang­ing his form at the same time as his name\" until he becomes incarnate in Jesus, and so attains to eternal rest. According to GHeb, a similar eschatological rest is attained by the Holy Spirit when the Son comes forth, and the Spirit \"rests\" upon him. The Spirit declares, \"You are my rest.\" The idea of rest is central in the Pseudo-Cle­mentines, and their ultimate statement about God is \"You are rest.\" Here then is a metaphysical counterpart (God is anapausis) to match the Chris­tian \"God is agape (love).\" 2En sees the restlessness of God as the fact behind creation. It does not say how (or even whether) the creation satisfied God's need for rest. It seems to be building up for an interpretation of Gen 2:2f, which says that God rested on the seventh day. The connection with creation is found also in the Apocryphon of John, where it is likened to the restlessness of Sophia at the beginning. This ex­plains \"moving over\" in Gen 1:2. Wisdom was moving around at the first in the darkness of ignorance. i. Philo's idea is that God \"conceived before­hand the models of its parts, and that out of these he constituted and brought to completion a world discernable only by the mind (Kosmos noetos) and then, with that for a pattern, the world which our senses can perceive\" (On the Creation 19). Cf. 24:2, which says that God made the visible out of the invisible. 25 a. If the sources behind this portion of 2En are ancient, it could represent one of the earliest attempts to reconcile the Bible with science. It tries to integrate Gk. physics with Gen 1. Yet it does not have an avowed apologetic intention. The cosmic-creative processes in 2En can be summarized as follows: 1. Disintegration, of light from Adoil (25:2), of darkness from Arukhas (26:2). 2. Solidification or thickening, the light solidifies into the upper foundation (25:4); the darkness solidifies into the lower foundation (26:3). In fact, this process of solidification (consolidation) seems to take place in two stages. To judge from 26:1 Arukhas is solidified from the original invisible things; but ch. 25 does not begin with a matching statement that Adoil (the light-bearer) was a con­solidation of originally visible things, for original existence consisted of invisible things only. Water, in turn, results from the consolidation of a mixture of light and darkness (27:2); the heavenly circles (28:1) and earthly rocks (28:2) are solidified from water. Fire is one stage further in the solidification of rock (29:2). 3. Mixing, of light and darkness in order to produce water (27:2); the seven crystalline circles are a mixture of wet and dry; lightning is a mixture of water and fire (29:1). Finally the constitution of man involves more complex mixtures, which are discussed in several different ways. At some points Gen is simply paraphrased with little embellishment, as on the rather uneventful fifth day (30:7), except that animals, as well as fish and birds, are made then, leaving man alone to be created on the sixth day. At other places there is not only embellishing but also drastic restructuring, as in the elaborate account of the creation of man (almost completely lacking in short MSS): or the bringing in of other biblical materials to enlarge the picture (the creation of angels and the fall of Satanail on the second day).

Word \"26.\"|a the events of the first three days in Gen 1 take place on the first day in 2En, leaving the second day for making angels; the third day is devoted entirely to the creation of Paradise. The two ac­counts are in phase at the fourth day. Even when biblical vocabulary is used it is sometimes given a different \"scientific\" meaning. On the third day, according to Gen 1, God separated the sea from the land by \"gathering\" the water together, so that the dry land \"appeared.\" In 2En (day one!) this \"collection\" is interpreted as the solidification of water into rock. b. R reads \"highest,\" which is more symmet­rical. c. There are three readings: vtka velikago, \"great age\" (A U B Chr); kamyka privelikaago, \"very large stone\" (V N B2); svita (J P R). d. Or \"let (something) visible be loosed from you.\" P lacks the repeated word, and J R razdaemo seems to have used the root \"to give birth.\" See n. i to my translation of MPr. e. See Eccl 24:4f. f. The significance of this action remains ob­scure. It evidently puzzled the scribes, since the MSS vary widely. First, the unsuitable chapter division has isolated this statement, making it the last action of the preceding episode rather than the first action of the next one. Secondly, the sequence of actions varies in the MSS. All culminate in the second creative command (26:2) and the two pre­ceding actions could be preparation for this. Prior to the first command, God was moving around; prior to the second he was seated on his throne. Thirdly, the verb is usually associated with obeis­ance in worship, vuskloniti being the opposite of nakloniti. Fourthly, on top of the mystery of the Lord bending or straightening himself, the associ­ated activity—before this in short MSS, after it in long ones—is described by several different verbs: viizrikhu, \"gazed\" (J P R); zrdkhu, \"looked\" (B Chr); rdkh, \"said\" (A U); vidikha, \"saw\" (V N). g. Much of the creation story now in long MSS could be original, allowing also that short MSS have sustained heavy losses and long ones probably contain some interpolations. 26 a. The connection between \"visible\" and \"in­visible\" is not clear. The confusion in the MSS reflects a tension between telling the stories of Adoil and Arkhas along the same lines, as against the idea that Arkhas produces darkness and so, perhaps, is never visible. In this cosmogony, then, both light and darkness come out of the original \"invisible,\" each becoming visible in its own way. In Gen 1:3 God commands the light to shine into pre-existent darkness; in 2Cor 4:6 the light shines out of darkness. b. The name Arkhas invites identification with Gk. arkhe, not unexpected in cosmology. Arkhe is one of the most fundamental concepts of pre-Socratic physics, and it remained in currency right down through the Neoplatonists.

The plural is met when two or more primal beings or substances are in mind; but the translator of 2En knew to render this literally as \"beginnings.\" It is worth noting that Damascius, last of the pagan Neoplatonic philosophers, quotes from the Baby­lonian creation epic and identifies the two ultimate principles of Babylonian cosmology, the primal water elements, Apsu and Tiamat (abyss), as ark-hai. But the Bible could have supplied the vocab­ulary of this section. Thus Prov 8:22-26 mentions arkhe (twice) as well as tas abyssas. On the other hand the spelling Arukhas suggests a Heb. word *aruk, \"extended\"; but it is not a creation word. c. Slav. Cermenu (\"red,\" long) or crunii (\"black,\" short). d. Together with 25:5 this makes a symmetrical picture of the cosmos. Nothing Adoil -* the great light -* Upper Foundation Ar(u)khas —*• darkness —> Lower Foundation Nothing The dualism of light and darkness arises from two primal beings, Adoil and Ar(u)khas. 2En does not say that God created them, but they are clearly under his control. This light and darkness are cosmophysical, not spiritual or ethical. They cannot be connected with the dualism of the Bogomils, which is quite outright—dva nafala (= arkhai) suti: edino ubo blago, drugoe zlo, \"There are two originals: one good, the other evil\" (cf. G. Wild, \"Die bogumilische Haresie in einigen siidslav-ischen Volksliedern,\" Die Well der Sloven 9 [ 1964] 258-76). 27 a. From this point onward short MSS are fragmentary compared to the full and coherent account of creation that continues in long MSS. Except for trivial details, J, P, and R agree com­pletely in the present chapter, whereas A, U, etc. have only a few words which scarcely make sense. At the very least we would expect the narrative to follow the thread provided by Gen 1; and this is present in vs. 4, even if the other material con­cerning the origin of water and the system of seven stellar circuits is extraneous. The former (vss. 1-3a) is quite in line with the fundamental cosmology of 2En. The latter (vs. 3b) does not fit the celestial structures described in chs. 3-21, but it does agree with 30:2a-3. At the present stage of research it is impossible to decide which, if either, of the two recensions is closer to the original. Even if vs. 3b in J, P, and R is an interpolation, vs. 4 must surely be original, and A, U, etc. lost this unobjectionable biblical material when the body of the chapter was excised. The mutilated state of the short MSS has produced further disorder. Comparison of A with V is enough to show that. Closer study indicates even more significantly that the key word put, \"orbit\" (for a planet), survives in V N as the"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"[J] \"And I gave the command: 'Let there be taken some of the light and some of the darkness.' »And I said, 'Become thickened, and be wrapped around with light!'

From another angle, the importance which Vail­lant attaches to the use of the verb grjasti (Secrets, p. xiv) as evidence of lOth-cent. translation into a Western dialect can be noted. He cites only its occurrence in 2:1, where only P (not even J R) has the isogloss idu. The use of the same verb (grjadut) in 27:3 to describe the movement of the planets is, by the same token, in favor of the authenticity of the passage. b. In 2En 27 there is a symmetrical universe in layers rather than concentric spheres. Some light and darkness, mingled in the intermediate zone, are thickened and spread out to make water, \"above the darkness, below the light.\" This central zone— \"the bottomless\" abyss—is encompassed with light; and this part of the cosmos is more like the Pythagorean system. Within this watery zone are seven crystalline circles (compare the crystal sea in Rev 4:6 and perhaps lEn 14:9-11, which also mentions \"the path of the stars,\" another point in favor of the authenticity of 2En 27:3). This system has nothing to do with the seven heavens in 2En 3-22, for those do not have a planet each, as in Ptolemaic celestial mechanics, and they are tiers not spheres. In ch. 27, however, each \"star\" has its own krugu, \"circle,\" or puti, \"route.\" c. Only in the center zone do light and darkness meet, making day and night. Here the account picks up Gen 1. d. J P, but not R, preserve the Heb. repetition of the preposition. e. The schedule of creation days, marked by the refrain from Gen 1, is augmented here by supplying the Slav, names for the days of the week in the secondary ch. headings. Instead of marking the close of daily work, it now marks the commence­ment of a new day. The formula \"evening and morning\" certainly gives that impression; but the original scheme is considerably changed as a result. Note the following development of thought: Preliminary acts—Conceptualization (ch. 24) Adoil (ch. 25) (light) Ar(u)khas (ch. 26) (darkness) Water and the seven circles (ch. 27) Day 1 Sea and land (ch. 28) Day 2 Fire, angels, fall of Satan (ch. 29) Day 3 Vegetation (ch. 30:l-2a) Day 4 Heavenly bodies (ch. 30:2b-6) Day 5 Fish, birds, reptiles, animals (ch. 30:7) Day 6 Creation of Adam and Eve; their fall and expulsion (ch. 30:8-32:1)"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"[A] 1 'Then encompassing (myself?) with the light of the ether, 2   *I thickened it. 3 I stretched it above the darkness. • 28 2 \"Then from the waters I hardened big stones, and the clouds of the depths I commanded to dry themselves. 3 And I did not name what fell to the lowest places. 4   •Gathering the ocean into one place, I bound it jCr.s:22: P* with a yoke.

There is a variation between J (P P2) sugru-zikhi (contraxi) and R siigre'zikh (commiscui). e. The impression given by Gen 1 is that orig­inally the land surface was covered by water, a condition to which it reverted as a result of the Deluge. On the third day the water was drained away so that the dry land was exposed. 2En 28:2 has an opposite approach. Here land was made by condensing and solidifying the primeval water. Is this intended to explain the undulations on the earth's surface? Philo's position {On the Creation 38) is between these two: originally \"earth and water being mingled together and kneaded, like a mass of dough, into a single element, without shape or distinction of its parts.\" The salt water was taken out to one place, but sweet water remains in the earth's pores to keep the soil fertile. f. Once more the shorter MSS are fragmentary, inferior, and in considerable disagreement among themselves. The negation in A U is an error, reading ne- from narekokh of other MSS. The terminology for the \"bottomless\" (hezdnula, \"abyss\") varies: upadok, \"fallen\" (R—cf. upad in A U, but V has upadoki), but propasti, \"gulf\" (J P P2). On the etymology of ahyssos, cf. Philo (On the Creation 29), \"for to kenon is a region of immensity and vast depths.\" g. The yoke restraining the ocean could be a fragment of mythology going back to the harness (muzzle?) by which yam (Heb. \"sea\") was re­strained in the Canaanite myth. In Job 38:10 the ever-threatening ocean is kept back by a barricade. But in 2En 28:4 the earth has become a solid shield above the lower deeps to keep them from surging up (e.g. Ps 24:2; Gen 7:11; 49:25). The MSS describe this threat differently. Where J R have \"from your own waters,\" P P2 have sostavu, \"composition\" (\"component parts,\" cf. APOT, vol. 2, p. 446). But all other MSS are unanimous in having \"water.\" A U, supported by V N, read simply ot vod(y), lit. \"from water.\" h. \"Established\" has the same root as \"foun­dation\" (cf. 24:5). The imagery is problematical, since we do not usually think of a firm upper structure as a \"foundation.\""},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"29 a. The two recensions are very different at this point, yet they agree in the central fact that fire was derived from rock and angels were made out of fire. b. J agrees with R in this reading (not shown in Sokolov's Lat. translation); but A U agree with P P2 in \"armies.\" There is no preposition, so \"fiery essence\" could be the complement; i.e. he made them a fiery substance. c. The same word, \"solid,\" was used in 28:4 to denote the celestial firmament. Perhaps the same is meant here. But o(t), \"from,\" is often missing from words beginning with o- (haplography); this phenomenon occurs in the following words in the text, \"(from) the flash,\" in P P2, but not in J R. So it is \"rock,\" not the firmament, that the great fire is cut from in vs. 2. d. The translation follows P P2. Yet J R have a good claim of being the superior reading, since they agree against P (whereas P usually agrees with J against R). Yet their reading, \"from the flash of my eye the lightning also received the watery (not \"marvelous\" [P]) essense,\" is difficult; and P P2 could be the result of reducing the difficulty. The theory is that lightning is a mixture of fire and water, but how the flash of God's eye supplies the aqueous component is not evident. e. Perhaps \"nipped,\" since the verb comes from brickmaking. f. \"Fire\" is not an element in Gen 1; hence it is important to seek for the background of this thought in 2En (it is present in both recensions). The Chaldean oracles state that everything comes from fire: eisin panta henos pyros ekgegaota (E. des Places, Oracles Chaldaiques avec un choix de commentaires anciens [Paris, 1971] p. 69). But Ezek 28:16 has a connection between stones and fire, and the myth behind this could have Canaanite connections, as well as supplying the form of the Lucifer myth found here in 2En. Even so, the derivation of fire from rock seems unparalleled; the reference to lightning suggests that the model is the striking of fire from flint. Cf. Akkadian (abnu) isdti, \"fire (-stone).\" Note that 2En's [J] 29 |Monday is the day. The fiery substance.|a \"And for all my ownb heavens I shaped a shape from the fiery substance.

In the Jewish tradition Gen 1 safeguarded the primacy of water. Even though Gen 1 does not mention fire, the commentators brought it in (cf. Rashi on Gen 1:8). g.

Christian explanations of the origin of evil linked Lk 10:18 with Isa 14 and Ezek 28, and eventually Gen 3. So vs. 4 could be a Christian interpolation. In the Byzantine tradition Satan's revolt took place on the fourth day, not the second, as here. Jewish theology concentrated on Gen 6, and this is prominent in the Enoch cycle as in other apocalypses. j. The Book of John the Evangelist describes Satan's presumption in similar language: \"He set his seat above the clouds of heaven\" (James, ANT, p. 188). GBart (4:24) explains that although Satan was the first angel created, he refused to worship Adam as the image of God. Later on it records his revolt: \"I will set my throne over against his throne\" (4:55). 30 a. This conflation with Gen 3:25 flouts the biblical chronology and obscures the significance of this arrangement as a consequence of sin. b. The scheme could be no better than a garbled Almagest by some uninformed individual. Only a few of the planets are on Ptolemy's levels. In 2En the disposition of seven planets on seven heavenly circles has nothing to do with the cosmology of chs. 3-21. It is not even clear that the seven crystalline circles of 2En 27:3 are the same as the Pythagorean or Ptolemaic spheres. In any case the seven heavens of the apocalypses represent layers: 2En 4:1 gives the impression that there are stars in the first heaven (cf. 30:4); but chs. 11-17 place sun and moon together in the fourth heaven. Note also that these planetary orbits are counted from the top down, whereas the heavens are numbered from the bottom up.

The hells in 2En are dark (7:1: 10:2), but not the fifth heaven. p. The translation \"come to know\" requires an emendation, since all MSS read \"I saw.\" P con­tinues the verb consistently, \"he does not see his own nature; that is why non-seeing is ...\" But J and R agree in reading \"He does not know . . . ignorance ...\" Hence it seems that the first verb should also be \"know.\" Confusion between vid-and v#d- occurs easily, and turns up in other connections.

The reading \"from him\" is according to P P2. J R read \"for him,\" perhaps under the influence of the preceding text. r. Charles (APOT, vol. 2, p. 450) connects this with Eccl 25:23 (i.e. 24).

According to 2En 42:3 the earthly paradise was open to the third heaven, making connection with the heavenly paradise. It was an issue for debate among the Fathers whether Adam could see angels. Here Adam both sees and hears them. Philo taught that hearing is lower than seeing (Cher 8; Sobr 8). Origen was criticized for teaching that men could not see angels (Epiphanius, Adv Haer 64.4; Justinian, Ep. ad Mennam; Jerome, Ep. ad Avitum 2). Origen reasoned thus: Angels are spirits which share with God the property of invisibility; that is, it is impossible for the human sense of sight to react with any body except one possessing color, shape, and size (First Principles 1.1.7). Origen would have found 2En in error at this point, unless, of course, at this stage, Adam is still a celestial being. Hence this detail does not settle the unsolved question of Origen's acquaintance with a book of Enoch that deals with the subject of creation. The idea that Adam was demoted from a heavenly paradise to earth (2En 32:1) is found in Origen. [For similar traditions re Adam, see especially the CavTr TAdam, and Vita. J.H.C.J d. The MSS all disagree in small details, but even the omission of a conjunction can make a big difference to the connections of phrases and sen­tences. Vaillant's translation (Secrets, p. 103) is based on extensive emendation. In particular, his putting Satan in charge of the lower regions is highly conjectural. It is unknown how Charles (APOT, vol. 2, p. 450) obtained Satomail, for all MSS read Satanail in contrast to Sotona (J P; R— P2 has Satana). The double use of jako suggests that two puns are involved. First, \"The devil\" will become a demon (best) because he fled (bize). The parallelism of this wordplay to the following pun on \"Satan\" throws doubt on Vaillant's (Secrets, p. 103) emendation of bisi (attested by all four MSS, and quite a suitable word). Secondly, he will be Sotona because his name was Satanail. (The GBart, 4:24, records the change of name from Satanael to Satanao.) The difficulty lies with the intervening words, where each MS is different: R sutvorili  su nbse J sutvori  su nbsi P sutvori sutvori s nbsii P2 / sotvori  sie b#su The word \"create\" is undeniable. One suspects a play on its first syllable (sut- or sot-) and the name Sotona. This paronomasia points to Slav. soil.

P2 appears to have moved from this possibility by changing \"heaven\" to \"demon.\" But the creation of a demon as such cannot be an act of God unless this is P2's way of saying that God punished Satan by turning him into a demon. The theoretical observations presented in the remainder of this ch. only make the matter more obscure. In general, 2En's strong overarching monotheism keeps its dualistic tendencies within limit. The Satan passages do not amount to a coherent or systematic doctrine of evil. In particular, a wicked ruler of the darkness of this world is never men­tioned as enticing to sin in the ethical sections (unless 34:2, 76:6, 25—the depravity before the Flood); nor does he have a hand in the climactic wickedness of the end time; nor is he the prince of hell in the places of torment in 2En; nor is he located in a domain of darkness, as opposed to God's realm of light. 2En 29:4-5 describes the revolt of an archangel (identified as Satan only in P's secondary ch. heading), who is hurled from heaven by God. In 18:3, on the contrary, the rebel leader's descent to earth is willful and contrary to God. 2En 31:4 is different again, casting Satan in the role of rival to Adam as ruler of the earth. We have, then, fragments of Satan stories loosely mixed, with no evident concern to link them into a consistent whole. This intellectual confusion prevails generally in 2En. e. The MSS are virtually identical, but the meaning is quite obscure. 32 a. The use of po, \"after,\" in the title could be an error for o, \"about.\" The noun is apparently locative. The idiom settles nothing, since it trans­lates no fewer than seven different Gk. prepositions. b. This curious exegesis of Gen 3:19b seems to be unique. It implies that Adam, made in a heavenly Paradise from materials brought from the earth, is now sent back to his native element to live there. Were it not for P's ch. heading, no connection with sin would be indicated. 2En 31:9 tends to blunt the edge of the biblical curse; Adam is blameless. Here Eve is not mentioned as banished to Earth with Adam. Similarly Gen 3:22-24 men­tions Adam only, not Eve. It cannot be proved that this stage in man's destiny owes anything to the theory of man's descent to bodily existence ascribed to Origen. We have only to remember that in the Koran (Sura 2:35-36), Adam and his wife begin in a garden not of this world. c. This familiar phrase need not be a Christian touch. It is not found in the NT, although Justin already uses it. It is scarcely conceivable that the writer of 2En, with his stark monotheism, at this point identifies the Lord as Jesus. On the contrary, the idea is present in Jub 1:26, where God descends at the end of the world, and lives with his purified children for eternity. d.

Besides Rev 1:10, which is not conclusive, the idea turns up in quite early Christian writers. c.

The command to disseminate the revealed teaching contrasts with the typical gnostic injunctions to conceal the mys­teries and impart them only to the worthy. 2En is similar to the Mesopotamian tradition. According to Berossus, Xisuthros (Sisithros = Ziusudra, the Babylonian Noah) was instructed to bury in Sippar all available writings, to preserve them during the Deluge. When it was, over, Xisuthros tells the survivors \"to rescue the writings from Sippar and disseminate them to mankind\" (W. Lambert and A. Millard, Atra-Hasis [Oxford, 1969] p. 136). j.

Milik's arguments (The Books of Enoch [Oxford, 1976) p. 110), relying on alleged Slav, rendition of Gk. consonants, only go to show how very weak the links in this chain are. According to the Koran, the blasphemers were not Solomon, but the evil ones, teaching men magic and such things as came down at Babylon to the angels Harut and Marut. This is not altogether clear. It gives the impression that these two angels taught magic and in particular the use of love potions."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"[J] 34 |God convicts the persons who are idol worshipers and sodomite fornicators, and for this reason he brings down the flood upon them.

The imagery of the yoke is already developed in the OT, where obedience to God is wearing his yoke like a docile draft animal, and rebellion is the opposite. The Torah as yoke is a familiar idea in Judaism and Jesus defined discipleship as taking his yoke (Mt 11:29), which could be a Christian counterstatement. Similarly Clement spoke of \"the yoke of his grace\" (I Clem 16: end) as if in contrast to the yoke of law. 2En 48:8, in its turn, identifies the yoke with obedience to Enoch's writings. But here (ch. 34) the language is vague to the point of obscurity. It is of importance to discover whether this yoke joins two partners, and refers to marriage. The injunction about seed is then in strict poetic parallelism. The baffling passage in 2Cor 6:14-7:1 has affinities with Qumran as with 2En 34. In the OT idolatry and sexual immorality are hardly separable. In 2En 34 idolatry and miscegenation were the two main provocations of the Deluge. Sodomy (a gloss in P in vs. 2) is a later addition confusing the traditions from Gen 18f. b. The inconsistency of the MSS (even within individual copies) in the use of verb tense forms shows up in the various translations. It remains uncertain whether the speech is prophetic prediction or describes what has already occurred. When are the events of 2En 18 to be dated in 2En's chro­nology? Since 2En 70:1 describes a golden age in the lifetime of Methuselah, that is, between Enoch and the Flood, 2En 34 corresponds to Gen 6:1-4, and is still future. But against this is the Paleja tradition that Enoch's righteousness was his refusal of the counsel of the giants, already abroad in his lifetime. c. This transparent and age-old metaphor of sexual rectitude, present also in 42:11, is required by the context. It has not been recognized by modern scholars, and it eluded some scribe in the line of long MSS who omitted the clause. The poetic structure, preserved in A U etc., suggests that \"yoke\" and \"seed\" are metaphors of the same thing. 35 a. Very little is claimed for the translation of ch. 35 in either recension. The texts are parallel, but the numerous minor variations and uncertainty over the clause boundaries make all MSS rather unintelligible. In the present stage of research all individual readings should be kept in mind as options. Comparison with CD 1.1 If. is especially inviting now that we know that Enoch books were in use at Qumran. Kahana's translation is worth considering, even though it smooths over many difficulties: \"And there will stand up from his seed another generation, the very last, and from them many will be very lustful. And in that last generation I will show to them the books written by your hand and by the hands of your fathers. And the keepers of the earth will show them to faithful men, those who do my will [cf. Lk 2:14], who do not call upon my name in vain: and they will report to that generation, and they, after they call upon them will be more glorious in the end than at the beginning.\" b.

Lit. from Heb. 7i saddiq (Gen 6:9). d. If the phrase \"last generation\" can be re­covered from the chaotic readings—the agreement of A U with J P in this detail (apart from punctua­tion) is impressive—then we have a very firm link with Qumran, where dor 'afjdron is a specialized term for the end-time. With a few exceptions its biblical occurrences refer to \"the next generation\" or vaguely to the future. Eschatological connotation arises from symmetry with dor nson (Job 8:8), \"the olden days.\" Of further importance is the construction of \"many\" with the preceding adjec­tive, not as in a new clause, as the usual translations have it. The postpositive conjunction leaves this in doubt. But if it is rabbim with the meaning \"all,\" then the whole phrase means \"the last generation of all.\" e. The opening words of vs. 2 are unintelligible, in spite of a fair measure of MS agreement. Vaillant (Secrets, p. 37) connects izvode with eksagoge (cours). Other attempts—\"the extinction of that family'' (Charles, The Book of the Secrets of Enoch, 1896); \"he who has brought up that race\" (APOT, vol. 2, p. 453), etc.—are no more satisfying. R agrees with short MSS (izvodi) whereas J P have merged the preceding preposition vo to make voz-vodja. The development could go in either direc­tion. The context requires the introduction of an authoritative teacher along with the restitution of the books of Enoch, to provide for the needs of the faithful in the end-time. We suggest that this is an act of God. In this setting izvodi(stvo) = ekbasis is not as suitable as vozvodi, which has the connotation of \"raise up\" (SRY, vol. 2, p. 273). Cf. egeiren (Lk 1:69), wyqm (CD 1.11). Cf. otstavlju (vs. 1). f. The \"guardians\" are not identified. One sus­pects angels, since various duties have been as­signed to them, notably the preservation of the books for use in the end-time. But the expression is obscure. The context does not clarify the rela­tionship between the \"righteous man\" and the \"truthful men.\" The key is the meaning of straiie, in which the MSS agree. Is it \"guard tower\" or \"watchman\"? Is it the teacher-interpreter, or are the writings themselves regarded as defense works against the evils of the last age? More problematical is the meaning of zemstei, for here the MSS are not agreed. Most MSS, in fact, have the more familiar adjective zemnii, zemlinii, or the noun zemli (V N); the latter is the easiest reading, \"of earth.\" g. The ambiguity of ty, which translates either Gk. sy or ekeinos, is reflected in the verbs which go with it. J has skaii; P R skazjut. B lacks the pronoun. In the former case, it is Enoch himself (either redivivus [although the term is hardly suit­able] or through his preserved and rediscovered writings) who will teach the last generation; in the second,4 'truthful men\" (the same as the' 'guardians of the earth\"?) who will do this.

The sequence of material in the next four chs. is hard to establish. There are major differences between the MSS. We have followed the sequence of the chs. as found in MSS of the longer recension (R J P). Other MSS which have the text at this point lack ch. 38 and have apparently reversed the sequence of chs. 37 and 39. The result in short MSS—36, 39, 37, 40—is not as suitable as the ordering in the longer recension. Furthermore, ch. 38 is surely authentic; at least it does not fit the common theory that such additional materials are interpolations put in by the so-called \"reviser\" who produced the longer recension. Its place in the narrative is vital, and the shorter MSS are crippled without it. The disarray of the text at this point is shown further by the peculiar material which A U have at the end of ch. 36 (see vss. 3f., lacking in J P R). Even Vaillant recognizes that this is a patch job which makes U inferior. But it is not so certain that it is only an interpolation, as Vaillant (Secrets, p. 37) says concerning 36:3f., which he omits from his translation. At least vs. 3 has a claim to authenticity (see 67:2), even though vs. 4 is premature at this point. The placement of ch. 37 between chs. 39 and 40 in A can be understood.

The two explanations of the need of refrigeration by the ice angel are not contradictory. In the first place Enoch was in personal danger of being sizzled by the Lord's incandescence. But it seems very late in the story to solve this survival problem. In fact the transformation achieved in ch. 22 has already adapted him to this environment.

In lEn, as Milik suggests (The Books of Enoch, p. 14, n. 5), the angels bring Enoch back and deposit him 4 'on the earth in front of the door of my house.\" This corresponds to the point of departure in 2En 1:10, for he had risen from his bed and gone outside and shut the door. The circumstance that Methuselah is waiting at the bedside suggests another version, in which the patriarch is taken away in his sleep. Or even in which the whole experience takes place in a pro­longed dream. (See nn. on 2En 1:3.) His return to his bed is then the fairy-tale equivalent of waking from such a dream. 39 a.

On the simile, see the n. on 22:1. f. A U share the curious error nami against vami of all other MSS. g. There should be no doubt that the reading in A U—tila, \"body\"—found also in B, is correct. It fits into the inventory of lips, face, eyes, right hand, and body. The word obijatie (A\\s consistent spelling is better than that in the short MSS) is a rare word, meaning \"range\" or \"compass.\" When the first-known long (P) and short (N) MSS (ver­sions A and B in APOT) are placed side by side, it is possible to suggest that the rather tedious recitation in P represents a tasteless expansion of the \"reviser,\" and that the short is original. But now A U have a virtually identical text to P, including the ideas most offensive to theological taste, esp. the remark about the size of the Lord's body (cruder than the short version) and the puerile simile in vs. 3 (which short MSS censored out in 22:1). One can see why Sokolov maintained that U (to which we must now add A, not known to Sokolov) represented an \"intermediate\" recension. Furthermore, one can see the mind of scribes at work on the changes. The ancestor of short MSS defused the idea by changing one letter, tila (\"body\") to dila (\"affairs, deeds\"), making it abstract. But the ancestor of V N etc. has simply excised the whole passage.

A U seem to be at fault here in using the participle \"discoursing.\" The switch to imperative is certain: \"Listen to the one who is giving you advice about an earthly king!\" Other short MSS (V N B B2) read the noun \"advice about an earthly king\"; or, perhaps, \"the parable of the earthly king.\" which makes a comparison a fortiori with the heavenly king, a strategy familiar enough from the Gospels. But the contrast is between instruction from an earthly king, which is terrifying enough, and teaching from the King of Kings. This only works if the earthly king is Enoch himself, who has been the other pole of the contrast all the way through the chapter. R J P have eased this problem by reading \"earthly father.\" The contrasting title of God has many forms in the MSS. A U read simply \"the king\" and VNB2 are similarly brief. B has \"King of Kings.\" J is more elaborate still. The conjunctions in R point to \"the King of Kings and of both earthly and heavenly armies.\" P's reference to \"living and dead\" could be a Christian gloss, since a similar passage occurs in Gregory's oration on his brother Caesarius, namely the in­vocation o zoes kai thanatou Kyrie! (PG, vol. 35, p. 788). i. The question at the end of this ch. in long MSS is unanswered, rhetorical. In short MSS it receives an apparent answer, because ch. 37 follows at this point. The conjunction no, \"but,\" marks the link. Enoch was able to endure because an angel of ice cooled him down when he was in the presence of the Lord, and \"that is how the Lord spoke all his words to me\" (37:2). Short MSS thus have a flashback to an incident not reported in the preceding narrative. The problem is not recognized during the sixty days Enoch spent in the seventh heaven, including a tete-a-tete seated next to the Lord.

Why should Enoch feel obliged to swear to this statement on predes­tination, a point already made in ch. 23? On the other hand, the longer version reads like a tortuous bit of casuistry, needed to account for the fact that a godly person like Enoch takes an oath, which is a forbidden thing. Dependence on Mt 5:34f. or Jas 5:12 appears obvious, but not certain. The statement that God does not use oaths is not true, so far as the OT is concerned. In fact the teaching of Jesus seems to be that \"Yes\" or \"No\" should be enough. The repetition explained in 2En reflects the Jewish legal opinion that \"Yes\" or \"No\" became oaths when they were repeated (b.Sanh 36a). b.

The words which Charles took to be the conclusion of this exhortation (52:16 of text B in APOT) we regard as the beginning of a new section (53:1 in our A). The text of V is continuous at this point, but A marks the onset of a new section quite clearly. In any case the words are a formula for beginning discourse. The grammar points to nyni de rather than wi'attdh or wk\\n)(t) of Aram, epistolatory address. The vs. is entirely missing from long MSS, which begin a new ch. here. (P has its usual synopsis of the coming ch.) The words could have been lost by homoeoteleuton of \"my children,\" at the beginning of vs. lb. 53 a. See ch. 52, n. j. The MSS are divergent, and the original text hard to guess. Note the variants: V da stavilo sveta nasltduete B da stavi sveta nasliduetu A na stavilo sveta nasleduite If some satisfactory explanation for \"balance\" could be found, V offers the best hope, since da, \"so that,\" is better than na, \"on.\" But the promise (\"so that you may inherit the balance of light for eternity\") is not clear. Hence A U have attached the word \"balance\" to \"injustice.\" I doubt if svitii has acquired its secondary meaning of \"world\" in these texts, or, rather, it retains its exclusive connotation of this earthly world.

It is hard to believe that a medieval Christian \"reviser\" making a copy of the ancestor of J P R from a Vorlage similar to A U V etc. would have interpolated the first sentence in vs. 2, so categor­ically inimical of the Christian doctrine of Christ's effectual mediation, unless he went too far in denying Enoch's intercessory power. It is easier to understand a scrupulous scribe, writing the ancestor of short MSS, eliminating such an objectionable doctrine—that there is not help of any kind for sinners. c. Notwithstanding P's ch. division and heading, J begins a major new section with this conventional opener. See ch. 52, n. j. (J is damaged at the bottom of the page, but the key readings are certain.) 54 a. In view of the insoluble problems in ch. 35, it is a pity that its companion (ch. 54) is in such an unreliable state. What are they to do with the books? Since J R have the same reading as V N, they are not to hide the books {potaite). P, omitting the negative, has the unique reading podavaite, \"give them away.\" B seems to say \"drink them in\" (napite) (\"sing them\"?), but the first syllable is a mistaken reading of negative ne of other MSS. b.

The word \"king\" is found in both R and P, but at different points. See 30:12. c. Slav, povinovenie, \"obedience,\" of other MSS is preferable to pominovanie (A U). d. The position of the word \"lord\" suggests that it is the subject of the verb, not the complement. It would be remarkable to give to man a title which, in this book, is used exclusively as the personal name of God. Nevertheless, the analogy of Ps 104:21 (LXX) makes it possible that J P R, which have gospodina, could be correct. In secular use the word is common enough as \"master.\" But B agrees with A U in lacking it, while V N have vlastela, \"overlord,\" perhaps to diminish the ex­alted title without adopting A U's drastic measures and excising it. e. In 2En 58:4 the souls of animals will be preserved to testify against humans: but they are not themselves considered to be morally account­able. This contradicts Jewish, Muslim, and even medieval Christian belief. The responsibility of animals is established by the prescription of pen­alties for their crimes (Gen 9:5; Ex 21:28). From these texts considerable jurisprudence developed. The Mishnah begins with rules for the constitution of courts for the trial of accused animals (Sanh ch. 1). f. R reads vu vice? velicim, \"in the great age\"; cf. 25:1 (A!). P has vu vice* cemu, \"in that age.\" J, by a simple error, reads vu velicim velici. Exactly the same thing happens in J at 61:2, but not at 65:8, where all MSS agree. g. A U share a careless reading, the repetition of do suda (but A spells it differently—with izica— on the second occasion). Most MSS read celovika, \"man\" (person), in one form or another; but B reads curiously do sada, \"to the garden,\" instead of do suda, \"until judgment.\" 59 a. Morfill (Secrets of Enoch, p. 75) inferred from the language of the ch. heading that its author believed that the crime being warned against was bestiality. Charles subsequently denied any such reference (APOT, vol. 2, p. 465). Each of the key words in the heading presents a distinct problem. Instead of the general term for \"beast\" (skot), used in the text, it has govjado; and for this noun SRY (vol. 4, p. 54) gives the meaning \"ox,\" as distinct from sheep. But R. M. Tseltlin (Leksika staroslav-yanskogo yazyka [Moscow, 1977] pp. 2If.) does not consider it so specific. Its absence from G. P.

Etimologideskii slovar3 slavyanskikh yazykov (ed. O. N. Trubacev [Moscow, 1980] vol. 7, pp. 74ff.) points in the same direction. There is no warrant, accordingly, for Morrill's \"Flesh of Cattle\" (p. 75), let alone Charles's \"beef\" (APOT, vol. 2, p. 465). But why should the scribe have selected such a specific term unless he had in mind, not offenses against animals in general, but something done specifically to a \"bull\"? Even more problematical is the reason given for this injunction—\"because of the outflow.\" Isticanije is a rare word. It is not listed in SJS. MSD (vol. 1, col. 1146) records two occurrences, unglossed. SRY supplies two mean­ings: (1) \"outflow,\" especially of blood; (2) [is-tecanie] \"going beyond bounds.\" If the former (a synonym of istedenie) is intended, then the nature of this outpouring is not clear. It requires reading between the lines to discover a reference to the \"bull's\" penis, which is not to be touched. The choice of this verb also has to be explained. Three aspects of the improper treatment of animals are dealt with: feeding badly (58:6), sacrificing wrongly (59:2-4), and whatever unlawful acts are referred to in 59:1 and 5. The emphasis on secrecy in the latter, and the severity of the penalty (loss of one's own soul), show that something more wicked than neglect or even cruelty is involved. In biblical usage, both Heb. and Gk., \"touch\" can connote \"injure,\" \"taste\" (food), or \"sexual activity\" (e.g. Prov 6:29; ICor 7:1). P's ch. heading resem­bles the latter in idiom, so bestiality is not excluded. This is the most likely evil to be done to an animal in secret (vs. 5). But the secret will come out at the last judgment, because the animal will lay charges. This suggests that isticanije should be connected with istecu, \"plaintiff,\" and refers to the \"accusation\" made by the victim, as in 58:6. b. Embarrassment over the topic, or simple incomprehension, could explain the differences among short MSS, for each family seems to have abbreviated it differently. V N have only vss. 1, 2a; B has only 2a, 2b, 3 (and then jumps to 60:4); A U have 2a, 4, 5. So among them, these three short families have preserved everything that is in long MSS. c. It is not clear whether this slaughter is dietary, cultic, or magical.

Origen does not enumerate the heavens. He does, however, call each heaven a sphere or globe; but this shape does not derive from physical astronomy; rather it is a purely rational deduction, for the sphere is the most perfect shape. Origen finds a biblical basis for all this by reasoning that each successive heaven is one of the \"resting places\" of Jn 14:2. The process is essentially intellectual. The soul's ascent is a process of education as it passes to higher and higher grades of enlightenment. 2En bears no trace of such synthesis with Gnosticism, unless it be in Enoch's reiterated claim that he has acquired knowledge of \"everything.\" But there seem to be only two sets of living quarters, the final homes of good and bad. g. All long MSS have \"no rest\" as well as 4 * nor returning.'' The fact that pokaanije (metanoia) is not used points up once more the total absence from 2En of the fundamental Jewish-Christian belief in human repentance and divine forgiveness as the prime factors in man's salvation. But see 62:3 and the n. there. h. Lit. \"big and little\"; which is a pure Hebra­ism. P R reverse the sequence, and could be more original. i. R repeats the last clause; but not in identical words, so it is not a case of simple dittography. It has ego first time, svoeju the second, as in J P's one statement. There could be a distinction between \"the works of his (the person's) hands\" and \"the work of his own (God's) hands,\" just as there is a comparison between the face of a person and the face of God."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"[J] 62 |About how it is appropriate to bring one's gift with faith.

While 2En teaches a noble humane ethic in general terms (ch. 44), its doctrine of judgment is rigorous legalism (ch. 61). This strictness continues in the short text of ch. 62. If the extant text is essentially original it deals precisely with the ne­cessity for the punctual fulfillment of vows. If the longer text of vs. 3 in J P R is authentic, the point is that vows must be performed immediately (cf. Num 30:2). Even worse is the retraction of vows; the person is not allowed to change his mind. If this is what pokajanije means, then it holds to the literal meaning of metanoia, and does not imply contrition. The point is important, and it goes with the problem of the meaning of otdanije also used here. The problem is that this word translates both antidosis and afesis. The original meaning seems to be strictly one of repayment, whether reward or retribution, as in 63:1. At the end of vs. 1, where long MSS have glossed otdaanie with grtkhom, V N have pokaanie adaniju, \"repentance for re­mission.\" Here \"repentance\" is an intrusion, be­traying the same drift to Christian vocabulary, even in short MSS. Except for vs. 3a. which has a good claim on being authentic, at least in its opening words, most of the additional material in the long MSS appear to be expansions by a Christian. This is certainly the case with the interpolations found only in P. notorious for such glosses. In early Rus the conventional Christian teaching on penance took firm hold. The Testimony of Vladimir Monomakh (1115) emphasizes repent­ance, tears, and almsgiving (cf. 2En 63:1) (PVL Part 1:153-163: see Adrianova-Perets [ 1950]). The main movement of long MSS in this direction is achieved by adding the phrase \"for sin\" to otdanie. thus achieving the phrase used in the Gospels: \"remission of sins.\" It should be noted however that V (and N) also read adaanie grikhovi. b. The phrase \"with faith.\" in the ch. heading and in vs. 1, is a Christian gloss peculiar to P. c. Since the nature of the \"gifts\" is not specified, it is not clear whether they are sacrifices or any kind of votive offering. Compare 59:2, 61:4. Un­fortunately we cannot reconstruct the cultic prac­tices of the community which used 2En as sacred scripture, whether in actuality or only in the author's imagination. Hence we do not know whether ti sotvoriti (here A U confirm the reading of J R, not in P), \"he performs it,\" means \"sacrifices\" or simply \"does.\" d. The reading \"before the time,\" preserved only by long MSS, completes the picture summed up in vs. 3. He cannot revise his vow before the deadline; nor can he count on an extension. Punc­tuality becomes the supreme virtue, in keeping with 2En's fascination with the exact measurement of time. e. The difference between blagoslovitcja (A U) and blagovolitcja (J P R) occurs here just as in"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"62 1 \"Happy is the person who, in his suffering, brings a gift 2 before the face of the LORD, for he will find remuneration. • And a person when with his mouth he appoints a time to bring a gift before the face of the LORD, and he does it, then he will find remuneration. But if the time specified elapses, and he carries out his promise, his repentance will not be accepted, 3   •because every delay creates a scandal. 63 1 \"(And) a person, when he clothes the naked (and) gives his bread to the  isa 58:7: Ezek 2 hungry, will find remuneration. 'But if his heart   187   should murmur, then he makes a loss, and nothing will be obtained. 3 And when the poor man is satisfied, and his heart is contemptuous, then he forfeits all his good work, and he will not obtain (anything). 4 For the LORD detests every kind of contemptuous person.\"   prov6:i6-i7   55:3. See the n. there. V has a different reading again: vuspiimeti (cf. N). This contradicts the others flatly. \"He (presumably God) will accept the (belated) change of mind.\" f. The addition \"after death\" is common to all long MSS: it is also in P's ch. heading. The point (confirmed by vs. 3, even in long MSS) is that it is too late to fulfill a vow after the specified time. g. While the first part of vs. 3 in long MSS has a claim to authenticity, the concluding phrase \"before men and a sin before God\" is dubious. The word \"God\" attracts suspicion. 63 a. This ch. shows more interest in spiritual inwardness than any other part of 2En. It could, however, be intended to counteract grumbling against rules of sharing in a community. b. It is hard to tell what has happened at the beginning of vs. 3. There are two main traditions. B has a drastically abbreviated text, consisting only of vss. 1 and 2. It introduces the qualification by aSte ze, not aSte li, which is generally used in other MSS. It is possible that the reading of A U significantly agreeing with J P R (apart from minor spelling variations), / nisti, is a mistake for this. If so, the ch. deals with only one matter—the spiritual conditions for effective almsgiving. This good deed can be ruined if the donor grudges the gift, or despises the receiver. This is the presentation of V N, which have aSte li egda at the beginning of vs. 3. But if the evidence of A U J P R is considered more original, then there are two sides of almsgiving in view. The receiver, when his misery is relieved, must not become haughty: otherwise he forfeits his reward for his previous endurance of poverty. The latter point is made only in J PR, either a gloss there or a loss from the other MSS. c. The much longer text of J P R is probably due to a scribe. Note the use of muz, not celovtku, for the second \"man\" (J R, not P); but A U V N use muzi for \"person\" the first time, so the abbreviation could be scribal. d. Apparently the offending member, the tongue, is cut out. Strictly speaking, ostrota is the point or edge, and ostrotoju could be intended as an adjec­tive, \"sharp.\" But one suspects behind this a word play, characteristic of the lurid punishments in early Christian horror accounts of hell (see n. e on ch. 7). The tongue must be punished by the \"tongue\" (the usual Heb. term) of the sword. e. Since the reference to \"fire\" is a deviant reading in P only, it does not indicate that 2En has a conventional hell of torment in fire. See, however. 2En 10:2. The punishment of a vicious tongue with fire could derive from Ps 120:3: but Dives' reference to his tongue (Lk 16:24) could be germane, since he was guilty of contempt for the poor, just like the malefactor in 2En 63."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"[J] 64 |About how the LORD calls Enoch up.

In P's curious gloss to 67:3, nadertanie is an inscrip­tion on a svitoku (= biblion). I have not found a listing of vyobrazenije in any lexicon or glossary.

The present passage seems to be inspired by Isa 30:26, which predicts that the eschatological sun will be seven times brighter than the present one. In 65:11 (A) the righteous will shine \"like the sun.\" Several Christian apocalypses predict that at the parousia or in his present glory the face of Jesus is seven times brighter than the sun (Epistula Apostolorum 16: ApPet 7; ActsPhil §20). 67 a. The veiling of the mysterious event in dark­ness resembles the evangelists' reports on the circumstances of Jesus' death. They do not have a correspondingly dramatic account of the return of the light. The GPet (6:22) does record the return of sunlight after the death of Jesus. The opposite is met in the Ebionite version of Jesus' baptism, according to Epiphanius (AdvHaer 30.13.7f., after the divine pronouncement of Ps 2:7 as in Lk 3:23) \"and immediately a great light shone round about the place.\" There is no preceding darkness, but"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"In long-suffering, in meekness, and in the affliction of your distresses, suffering.\" go out from this age of 67 While Enoch was talking to his people, About the taking away of Enoch the LORD sent darkness onto the earth, and it became dark and covered the men who were standing   with Enoch. #And the angels hurried and (the angels) grasped Enoch and carried him up to the highest heaven, and the LORD received him and made him stand in front of his face for eternity.

Morgenstern points out that \"A far larger number of events in the traditional early history of Israel are linked to this day than to any other festival\" (\"The Calendar of the Book of Jubilees,\" VT 5 [1955] 56).

Vaillant fol­lowed Sokolov in recognizing its integral place as a continuation of 2En. It has no MS existence as a distinct work. For this reason we have continued the ch. enumeration.

Vaillant's main text is U, with the variants of R in his annexe. Since we present A and J in our two versions, the complete information about these four witnesses is now available. In ch. 69 the textual differences between long (J R) and short (A U) MSS are minor. Even so, they are worthy of close attention. The Hebraic (or at least pseudobiblical) character of the original is abundantly manifest and the exotic character of the Semitic idioms, due to literal translation, created strains in Slav, syntax.

They dropped the preposition and kept the redun­dant noun: \"Stand in front of the face of the Lord and the face of his people.\" B has naturalized the idiom differently, but the telltale noun \"face\" remains. \"Come with us to (na) the face of the Lord and to (na) the face of your people and in (vw) the face of the altar of the Lord.\" In vs. 5 (cf. 17 and 70:14, 18) J R retain prid, but B A U switch to v: \"m front of them and in front of my altar.\" The fluctuation of svoegoltvoego is also revealing, since this option does not exist in Heb. Other palpable Hebraisms are \"the time of evening,\" \"the elders of the people,\" and \"the altar of the Lord.\" In fact one has only to glance at Kahana's translation to realize that literal back-translation into Heb. yields perfect classical nar­rative prose. An important principle of text criticism follows from these observations, which could be multiplied indefinitely. The \"correctness,\" i.e. originality of a reading, should not be tested by conformity to the norms of Slav, syntax. It is the opposite. The more Semitic idiom has the better claim, the more Slav, idiom is the result of domestication subse­quent to translation. b. The lacuna in A U at this point is made up by B. c. B retains the Hebraic ethic dative, and kit with indirect object; J R have adjusted to the simple dative.

Her husband has it all explained to him by an angel, so there is no crisis (Book of James 4:2). d. Sacral abstinence from sex while engaged with the holy mysteries is not a rule exclusive to Christian clergy of the Eastern churches. (1) The angels of heaven, in contrast to the Watchers, have never been defiled with women; hence sexual activity is banned in their presence (lEn 15:3f.). (2) There was to be no sex for three days during assembly at Qumran (lQSa 1.26). (3) This is related to the warrior's sacral abstinence (ISam 21:5). The Qumran community emphasized that there was to be no sex during war, \"because the holy angels accompany the armies\" (1QM 7.3-7). (4) The Temple Scroll prohibited sex within the holy city Jerusalem (lQTem 45-47). (5) Moses refrained from sex after the Lord appeared to him (R.

I. ANDERSEN Medio Pravednoe (\"The Just Balance\")1 is the name of a celebrated collection of juridical and ethical writings of East Slavic provenance. A reference to Simeon, Bishop of Tver, who died A.D. 1288, as well as other evidence, shows that it was compiled in the thirteenth century. One of the sources was 2 Enoch. Material was excerpted from several different places in that work and rearranged to make a veritable pasticcio.2 The manuscripts of Medio Pravednoe have been described by Lyubimovy3 and Tik-homirov.4 Vaillant, following Sokolov, lists four copies of Medio Pravednoe: manuscripts numbered 15, 489, 682, 253 in the Trinity-St. Sergius Monastery,5 now housed in the Lenin Library, Moscow. Tikhomirov stated that there were three copies of Medio Pravednoe? Meshchersky now reports five.7 In any case Medio Pravednoe occupies a special place in 2 Enoch studies. It was in this miscellany that the existence of a Slavonic Book of Enoch was first made public.8 It was also the first text of 2 Enoch ever printed; a transcription of TSS 15 appeared in Tikhonravov's Pamyatniki.9 Collation with the photos shows a few errors in this first publication. This manuscript was also the first (and is still the only) witness to 2 Enoch to be published photographically in facsimile.10 This copy was made in the middle of the fourteenth century, and so is the oldest known evidence for the text. The prestige deserved by this manuscript because of its antiquity is offset by the fact that the text has been rewritten with such extreme liberty. Yet even though the original narrative was separated and reassembled in a completely different pattern, there is no indication that any of the actual words were changed. In individual cases, then, its readings could have a superior claim to originality. For these many reasons, a translation of TSS 15 is appended to the contribution on 2 Enoch. 1 The title goes back to zygos dikaios, md'zene-sedeq (Job 31:6). 2 The section from chs. 41 to 65 supplies the material, which has actually been sorted out. Statements on the same subject, scattered in 2En, are gathered into one place to make a collage which in some ways is more coherent than the original. 3 V. P. Lyubimovy, Pravda Russkaja, vol. 1, ed.

The Enoch extracts occupy ff. 36-380b, six pages."},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"ENOCH TRADITIONS PRESERVED IN MER1LO PRAVEDNOE From the books of Enoch the righteous3 before the Flood, and now he is (still) alive. Listen, my children! Even before all things did not exist, the LORDc established |65:i]b the age of creation. And after that he created the whole creation, visible and invisible;11 and after all that he created man according to his own image, with his own two (65:2] hands,6 small and great/•* and he appointed for him eyes to see and ears to hear11 and reason to argue. Then the LORD released1 the age for the sake of man; and he divided it into seasons [65.3] and years,j into months and days and hours; »so that a person might think about the [65:4] changes of the seasons, the beginnings and the endings,k so that he might estimate his own life and death. a. This title is different from those of all other MSS. b. The ch. and vs. references correspond to those of J used as a standard. c. A U have the opposite sequence, verb = subject. d. This stock phrase is probably used unreflect­ingly, and does not imply a sequence. In the Fathers, the invisible creation of spirit beings is completed first. Thus Basil, in his Hexaemeron (I § 5), argues that there was a whole invisible order, including angels, created before the visible order. Other schemes include the creation of angels on one of the six days. In 2En, since angels are created out of fire, they come rather late in the story. e. The phrase \"with his own two hands\" is found in A U at 44:1. f. The phrase \"small and great\" is found in A U at 44:1, but not contiguous with the preceding one. Furthermore, that text says \"in the likeness of his face.\" g. This phrase replaces the original \"male and female.\" h. MPr lacks the reference to the heart found in other MSS. i. Slav. razdriSi in MPr. The scribes evidently had difficulty with this term, which is very impor­tant for understanding 2En's doctrine of creation. It occurs again in 25:2, which also has to do with the creation of \"the great age\" and where the MSS are similarly confused. There such a term comes three times. Adoil is commanded to dissolve himself so that the visible might be dissolved from him (or so that what was yielded by this action might become visible) and he dissolved himself, and \"the great age,\" which had previously been in his belly, came out. This great age became the carrier of all the creation that the Lord wished to create. Vaillant (Secrets, p. 31) equates the Slav, verb with luesthai but with the metaphorical sense of accouchement. This certainly finds support in the imagery of the great age in Adoil's belly and in the verb \"came out.\" The latter, however, does not prove that Adoil gave birth to the great age. It seems rather from the language of 25:1 that there were stages, more physical in concept than suc­cessive emanations. First Adoil \"came out [or \"down\"]\" from the depths: then the great age \"came out\" from Adoil. Then (65:3) the great age was divided up into segments of time. Here we seem to have a more abstract Neoplatonic theory of the creation of particulars by dispersion, rather than a version of the egg theory of primeval creation. Nevertheless, the imagery of birth has been found in the language. V N read razdaemoe for razriSaemoe in 25:2, and this reading, although poorly attested and best explained as secondary, is preferred by Vaillant because of his acceptance of the birth theory. The use of the dominant verb razdriSiti in MP r's text of 65:3 is therefore im­portant. For there God is the subject of the verb, and it is hardly likely that any myth in the mon­otheistic tradition of 2En would teach that God gave birth to the world. Furthermore, as the text continues, it makes it clear that this act of God, performed on the age for the sake of man, consisted precisely of breaking it up into discrete portions. The verb razdiliti is quite unambiguous in this respect. The equation of razdriSiti with lusai can be accepted, but not the inference that it means birth. The verb in A U, razriSiti, also means lusai in the sense of \"undo\" (a shoelace), \"release\" (from sins, i.e. forgive). In fact razdriSiti is simply a Russian variant, as shown, e.g. by systematic differences in the Ostromir Gospels (see the quo­tations from Mk 1:7 and Mt 18:18 in MSD, vol. 3, pp. 37, 52). But, so far as I can ascertain, it is never used to describe the release of a child in birth. A meaning somewhere between \"relinquish\" and \"annihilate\" is required. The control is sup­plied by the exposition which follows. Time is divided; and this is done for the sake of man. That is, time was differentiated, and made the medium of change so that man could be given his creaturely and fallen existence in such time, and so work his way to salvation as timeless existence, the climax of MPr, as its closing lines show. j. The MSS differ extensively as to the units of time and their ordering: year, season, month, day, hour. The lack of interest in the \"week\" as a unit of time is conspicuous, but quite characteristic of 2En, which is a point against locating it in main­line Judaism. The term \"seasons\" is not cleanly used because it is evidently mixed up between vremya meaning \"time\" (in extension) or \"sea­son\" (of the year), as well as all the range of ideas covered by chronos and kairos, both of which it translates. In addition to the possibilities of \"(stretch of) time\" and \"(point in) time,\" 2En is interested in the beginning and ending of an epoch in time, especially the human life-span, with an astrological concern for the instant of birth and the instant of death. k. A U are more ample at this point, with a reference to \"years and months and days and hours,\" which MPr has in vs. 3, where A U lack the phrase. This could be a simple example of textual dislocation. But A U also read plurals. Vaillant (Secrets, p. 62) thinks that U is better. But the focus seems to be on death as the end of life and the sobering reflection on the inevitable termination of all time periods."},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"And behold, my children, 1 am the manager1 of the arrangements on earth.

Similarly also (one) person is more worthy than (another) person: one because of much property; another because of superlative wisdom* of the heart; and another because of intelligence 1. The MSS are very divergent in their reading of this verb, upon which so much depends at this crucial point; for it defines Enoch's cosmic role. The variations probably betray theological embar­rassment among the scribes. The unusual word order compounds the difficulty. The reading of the second verb in A is pamitaa. \"remembering\"; U reads pometaya. which could represent riptein. Enoch casts away the things of earth. But other MSS (B N) agree with MPr. V reads promttaemaa (= N); MPr has promitaya. Sreznevskil {MSD. vol. 2, p. 1544) was unable to suggest a meaning for promitati. Vaillant (Secrets, p. 45) accepts p(r)ometaya. which he identifies as a rare verb corresponding to basanizo. The meaning is not quite suitable, and it does not correspond to Enoch's research earlier in the book. It casts Enoch in the role of investigator as well as recorder. The simplest solution is that Enoch observed the way things had been arranged on earth, and recorded his obser­vations. But this is unobjectionable, and, if original, would hardly have upset the scribes. Other passages suggest that Enoch himself was in charge of these arrangements, which could have been objected to as an intrusion on divine prerogatives. It is also unclear whose deeds \"on earth\" he scrutinized, those of God, or those of men. If the former, then Enoch is the chronicler of creation as in ch. 40; Vaillant (Secrets, p. 45), citing WisSol 13:2, thinks it alludes to the way God has directed events on earth, in contrast to the theory that they are controlled by natural forces, wrongly considered divine. If the latter, Enoch is compiling the records to be used in the last assize, as in 50:1. The evidence for the first verb is even more mixed. A and U read i krai, which makes no sense. Vaillant's notes imply the following schema: krumifistvuemaya krumswuemaya^^ • kriimstvuema (R) kormstvuemaya (B2) korystvuemaa (V N) skorstvuyaya (B) pravlemaya (MPr) i krai (A U) N's reading yielded \"the things that can be used on earth.\" The verb is not recognized by the Prague lexicon; the attestation given by Sreznevskil sug­gests it is a Rusism. MPr seems to be an interpre­tation: the things that have been ordered on earth, i.e. by God. Vaillant (Secrets, p. 45) admits that the verb krumistvovati is otherwise unattested, but he interprets it as a \"plausible\" variant of krumi-distvovati. m. MPr has condensed the text at this point, omitting the breakdown of time into smaller units: year, month, day, hour. n. The MSS show considerable variation in the use and placement of the conjunction /, \"and.\" This variation makes a big difference to clause boundaries, and connects verbs with different ob­jects. The trouble seems to be caused by stress in the syntax, whether it is better to have the object before or after the verb. In the present instance the effect is to make \"seed\" the object either of the preceding verb (\"I wrote down\") or of the follow­ing verb (\"compared\"). In view of the exposition which follows, two ideas are being developed. There is the division of time into small units, and the differentiation of these units, so that no two days are the same. In a similar way the dispersal of seed produces individ­ual human beings, all different. The thought begins with the act of the Creator, who made a variety of \"seed on the earth.\" not the many species of animals and plants each created and reproducing \"after its kind,\" according to Gen 1, but the variety of the common seed of mankind. We have already seen in MPr 36:8 (= 65:2) the alteration of Gen l's \"male and female\" into \"small and great,\" and this thought receives more attention here. There is tension in the MSS between describing such facts as something either God or Enoch arranged. Some­times it comes out as the latter, as if he is some kind of manager of the cosmos. The reading of A U, raznestvovakh, probably means \"dispersed,\" i.e. differentiated. The variant in MPr. izrovno-vakhu, is unique (it provides the only entry in MSD), and probably means \"compared.\" Changes in the conjunctions make its object, not \"every seed on earth,\" namely all mankind, but \"every measure and the just balance.\" o. Other MSS read \"every\" at this point. p. MPr shares the reading ispisakhu, \"wrote.\" with B, against ispytak. \"probed,\" of other MSS. q. It is hard to know what English equivalent to use for rtstinyi. It is well illustrated by its use to translate entimos (Lk 7:2) or entimoteros (Lk 14:8). Even so, the moral connotation is not secured, whether this difference in \"honor\" is in the estimate of others, due to different grades of achievement, or due to differences in nature (whether by accident or divine decree). The following anal­ysis does not settle the point since it is a mixture of these. r. Whereas A U etc. list the series with obu . . . ob ie . . . ob zV .../.../.. .

V reads / khytrosti i mliiania ezyka i ustnu. A U have khitrosti i molianiya ustennago. V thus agrees with A in adding \"cunning\" to \"intelli­gence\" (but A lacks the conjunction). But MPr agrees with A in having \"silence of the lips,\" where V (N also) adds \"tongue and\" lips. MPr. however, has prosto instead of khitrosti. It is not obvious what nuance this introduces. At the end of the list, it could mean \"perhaps.\" or \"simply\" (haplds). Note, however, that MPr has primudrosti and the prosto- could be a similar prefix. Hence Sreznevsii thinks it means \"complete silence\" (MSD. vol. 2, p. 1577). u. At the very least episkopein lies behind this word. But behind it again is surely lipqod (the variants point to an original supine). But the associations of either judgment or redemption are not present in the descent of the LORD. v. Other MSS read svoeya, \"his\" creatures. w. V reads \"the LORD God\" as in Gen. x. It is hard to recover the original tradition behind this list of names. The difficulty with MPr is that both skotu and zviri mean \"animal,\" with a distinction corresponding to Heb. bihemdh (do­mestic) and hayydh (wild). But the use of both to represent therion is illustrated by a paraphrase of Gen 3:14: proklata ty otu vusikhuskotu i zvirei zemuskyku. MSS like A which read gad zemnyi, \"reptiles of the earth,\" are doubtless better. It is like the list in Acts 10:12; but this too has variants, such as vi neuie bikhu vca ietvrinoga zemle i zviri i gadi i pike nebesneye (SJS, vol. 1, p. 388). y. This idiom does not seem to derive from the OT directly. Cf. glagole ki vsimi pticami pareStimi (Rev 19:17). Note that R also has parjastei po vozdukh(u). Cf. J P. But A U have pernatyya (\"feathered\"). z. The Heb. idioms are more palpable here, but this could come through Gk. The text does not correspond to Gen 2:19 in these details, and LXX follows the Heb. literally. We have, then, an independent Midrash on Gen 2:19. a2. MPr is closer to MSS of the longer recension than to those of the shorter recension at this point. This suggests that sometimes their longer readings might preserve something original that has been lost from the shorter recension. b2. This is followed by the numeral .v.ye in MPr. This is written fully in A and V (vtoroe). and the punctuation of both suggests that it goes with the preceding noun, not after a comma, as in Vaillant's edition. Still its significance is not clear. It could be a corruption of pod ruci ego (J), \"under his hand.\" c2. Slav, vu vici semi. Other MSS have \"the great age.\" d2. The main variants are as follows: B edino misto esti i koSari edinago i ograda edina i pastvina A U edino misto esti i ograda edina i pastvina edina V edino misto I / koSari edini MPr yedino misto koSara yedina i pastvina B place pen yard pasture A U place yard pasture V place pen MPr place pen pasture e2. A U read \"created\" and V has the same verb. V continues vlastela vsemu steianiyu (see n. g2) svoemu. A U lack the first word \"lord.\" f2. Slav, ilvka. not Adam. g2. If Vaillant (Secrets, p. 57) is correct that this passage imitates Ps 105:21, then we must conclude that it comes directly from Heb., not Gk. The passage, however, is not very close to Ps 105:21 (104:21 in LXX): (1) It is not an individual (Adam) but mankind that is appointed to the Lord's property, so there is no analogy of king and vizier. (2) No title is used, as in 30:12; but V does use vlastela, which could reflect yddon rather than kurios, while J has gna, \"lord.\" The agreement of a long and a short MSS in supplying a title must be offset by the fact that each has a different title. (3) A number of Heb. words lie behind ktesis. and this fluctuates with ktisis in the Gk. MSS. h2. A Hebraism. nepeShayydh, \"animal.\" Gen 9 could be behind the interpretation attempted in 2En. i2. That is. of animals. j2. There is a considerable omission here. k2. Slav, zlobezakoniye. But A U read zloza-konie, \"evil-law,\" or, perhaps, \"making the law evil,\" and B is similar.

Not all MSS preserve the parallel statements found in MPr. There seems to be a play on the sound of similar words, if not outright puns. If the latter could be proved, it would show that this passage at least was composed in Slav. vriya ilvka v siti samu oubyazayeti vriya ilvka v sudd ne oskudiyetx su ye go vu viki The first word in both statements has more than one possible meaning. 1. First, we note the reading of P. vlagayai. the source of Charles's \"put\" {APOT. vol. 2. p. 465). Since this is not supported even by R and J. it may be set aside as a corruption. Note, however, vlagati vu stydu (SRY. vol. 2, p. 207). 2. The spelling in MPr (vriya) (cf. A U) leaves undetermined the stem vowel. It could be the verb vriyati (or vrivati) (SRY, vol. 3. p. Ill): \"shove.\" \"push\" or \"throw.\" It could be vriti. one of whose meanings is \"boil,\" \"seethe.\" The signif­icance of this possible meaning, at first sight improbable, is its correlation with (so)sud (SRY, vol. 3, p. 109). Its variant is veriti (SRY, vol. 2, p. 87). 3. On the other hand, J has the reading variyui. SRY (vol. 2, p. 23) gives this the meaning \"lie in wait\" (podsteregat'), but it also means \"forestall,\" \"anticipate.\" 4. The reading in V (virai) is closer to MPr than to J; but the similarity is insignificant, since the vers tend to be used indiscriminately. The unique text of P, which has a different verb in each statement (as if explicating the pun), also uses the unambiguous sosud, \"vessel,\" which is neither a corruption nor an interpretation, but a resolution of the original homonym sud (this is both the ordinary word \"judgment\" and also the archaic equivalent of sosud). P thus resolves the ambiguity which is apparently present in MPr: \"He who lies in wait for a person with a net . . .\" \"He who forestalls a person in judgment . . .\" (or \"He who boils a person in a caldron\"). 5. There is no question about the wordplay in the second statement (so)sud . . . -skud- . . . sud. Sud is a straight pun, reading vriya for virai or vereya or vareya. There is secondary play on seii (\"net\")/W (\"vessel\" or \"judgment\"), but this is lost when there is only one statement. Even so. since the second statement in its more obvious meaning is a solution to the riddle in the first statement, it is less likely that it conceals another enigma in its own double meaning. Since MSS of 2En are the result of a fluid tradition, we cannot settle the \"correct\" reading of such sayings by reverting to the earliest text known to us. For all we know, MPr might already have leveled the verbs which are still distinct in P. The idea is commonplace (Ps 9:16; Eccl 27:26). but these biblical passages are not the immediate source of the wording in 2En. The Slav, verbs do not match the originals. Eccl 27:26 has ho histdn pagida en aute haldsetai. This is more succinct, more down to earth, less eschatological than 2En. By adding the word \"person\" 2En lowers the enigmatic content. And the impression remains that the word­play was concocted in Slav. m2. Note that 44:1 has already been used in effect at 58:3b above. See nn. e and f. Vaillant (Secrets, p. vi) says that this section is \"abridged\" in MPr: but one wonders if A U already show signs of glossing. n2. The more ample texts have four rude ges­tures, each separately stated. The last, spitting, is detached from the others. In this detail the text of MPr is similar to A U, except that the latter have plural (\"they spit\") against the preferable singular of all other MSS which have the passage. Yet. in spite of this agreement, the longer reading of 44:3 in R J P seems to be better. o2. A third category is mentioned in A U. p2. The word in the title of the miscellany. q2. MPr has the same word here as in 46:3. There it is the same as A, but here A reads niktoze ne moieti ukrasti sye, \"no one will be able to sneak away.\" r2. Here MPr neoskudno has the same root as the verb in 37ob:3 [60:4], and this gives it pref­erence over other MS readings, particularly A (plotno), which seems to be a corruption of nluno (R). Furthermore, MPr is supported by B (neosku-diemo). s2. A reads vsyakogo skorbi, \"every kind of affliction,\" thus losing the allusion to the yoke.

The MSS are quite confused over what to do with this yoke, whether to accept it or to get rid of it. In the latter case there is a suggestion that it is a work of charity to remove the heavy yoke from another. The different positions of the phrase \"for the LORD'S sake\" also secure different nu­ances; either the yoke comes on to you on account of the LORD or otherwise repudiate it for the LORD'S sake. The main readings are: MPr, A dtrHxte (U has otreSite). OturiSiti, if genuine, reflects luein, but this does not seem to suit the spirit of the passage. The reading in B (poterpite) fits better, for it could mean \"endure.\" P has terpite, but J has vusi ponesete i otriixte e, which is essentially the same as R. So there are four verbs: oturiSiti {MPr A U) otriziti (J R) (po)terpiti (B P) ponesiti (J R) renounce or loose cut off endure carry Perhaps there are only two, those in J R being variants of the ones found only singly in other MSS. Even so, the two ideas seem to be opposed: ridding oneself of the yoke or bearing it patiently. The yoke is not the yoke of obedience to Torah nor the yoke of Christian discipleship. neither of which was considered a burden. It is persecution. There seems to be no logical way of combining the recommended responses, unless oturizati means \"release\" the yoke from someone else, or oturisiti means \"forgive\" your persecutors. u2. MPr lacks two pairs of blessing and cursing found in longer MSS at this point. v2. A U have the variant gordago. \"terrible.\" w2. Slav, skreninomu, with initial / added in correction by another hand. x2. The diverse readings at this point show that the scribes have lost control of the text. MPr (yetero bole) should be retained for three text-critical reasons: because it is old, because it is difficult, because the others can be derived from it. Yetero corresponds to tis and becomes variously nekoe, nekotorye (A). The main alternative to bole is pole (B) and seems to mean \"field\" (pedion, campus). Vaillant (Secrets, p. 42) accepts this reading and meaning (une certaine plaine). but the language does not suit the imagery of a prison. MSS otherwise divergent agree in bole. The reading in A is very clear, since it writes the b in an unusual way. So it has a strong claim. But what does it mean? The stem bol- is found in words meaning either \"sick\" (hence R J P kako bolit) or \"great,\" neither of which makes sense. If pole is preferred, but the meaning \"field\" causes difficulty, perhaps it de­rives from politi = phlegein. The language is remarkably like Codex Suprasliensis 142:26. Sedu na misto ideie biafe ogni raiduzenH. Vidivu plameni polyaSti. Cf. Dan 7:9, pristolu ognenu-yemu kolesa yego ogni poly a {pur phlegon). Hell is a place of flaming fire. y2. Slav, ouvidakhu. A U have ouvidikh, \"I saw.\" z2. MPr (also B) reads na, not the usual pred. a3. This passage highlights the total lack of any scheme of salvation for sinners in 2En. b3. MPr's smrada is preferable, and is probably the source of yarma (A), \"yoke,\" not igo, the usual term in 2En. c3. Lit. \"face.\" d3. MPr: vnyalu.

ALEXANDER 3 Enoch purports to be an account by R. Ishmael of how he journeyed into heaven, saw God's throne and chariot, received revelations from the archangel Metatron, and viewed the wonders of the upper world. It falls into four main sections. (1) Chapters 1-2, 4The Ascension of Ishmael\": Having passed through six heavenly palaces, one within the other, Ishmael is challenged by the guardian angels at the gate of the seventh, innermost palace. In response to his prayer for help God sends him the archangel Metatron, who ushers him into the seventh palace and presents him before God's throne. God graciously receives him and he joins the angels that attend the throne in reciting the Sanctus (the QeduSSah). (2) Chapters 3-16, 'The Exaltation of Enoch\": Metatron informs Ishmael that he is none other than Enoch the son of Jared (mentioned in Gen 5:18-24), whom God translated from earth to heaven and elevated over all the angels as his vice-regent. Metatron explains how and why he was taken up, and reveals in detail the steps by which he was transformed in mind and body from a human being into an angel; he describes his insignia and the heavenly functions he now performs. (3) Chapters 17-40, \"The Heavenly Household\": Metatron discourses to Ishmael on the organization and activities of the heavenly world. He gives an elaborate account of the angelic hierarchies, and describes a session of the heavenly assize and the performance of the climactic act of the angelic liturgy—the recitation of the celestial Sanctus. (4) Chapters 41-48, \"The Sights of Heaven\": Metatron takes Ishmael and shows him various heavenly marvels. These have to do with three main topics: (a) Cosmology: Ishmael sees the cosmic letters by which the world was created. He is also shown cosmic \"opposites\" (such as fire and water) held in balance by the power of divine names, (b) Eschatology: Ishmael sees the curtain {pargod) that hangs before God's face, and represented on that curtain the whole course of human history from Adam until the coming of the Messiah. He also sees the right hand of God, behind his throne, waiting the appointed time of Israel's redemption, (c) Psychology: Ishmael is shown various souls; the souls of the righteous enjoying God's presence; the souls of the wicked and the intermediate in Sheol; the souls of the Patriarchs interceding for Israel; the souls of the stars; and the souls of the angels who have failed in the performance of the Sanctus, banished from God's presence and incarcerated behind fiery walls. This summary of 3 Enoch is based on the contents of manuscripts A and B. The form of the work in these two manuscripts shows clear signs of editing; if we exclude the patently additional chapters 23-24 and 48BCD, then the overall structure of the work is reasonably coherent, and thematically related materials have been grouped together. It is evident, however, on closer investigation, that 3 Enoch has arisen through the combination of many separate traditions: it tends to break down into smaller \"self-contained\" units which probably existed prior to their incorporation into the present work. In the process of being brought together these pre-existing units of tradition were accommodated to each other only minimally, and so the work contains not a few cases of overlapping, inconsistency, and even contradiction. Manuscripts A and B give the longest recension of 3 Enoch. It is not clear whether the shorter recensions found in the other text-witnesses are abbreviations of this long recension,"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"or whether, at least in some cases, they represent earlier stages in the growth of the work; the traditions may not all have been assembled at once, but could have come together in stages. There is some evidence to suggest that chapters 3-15 on the exaltation of Enoch are the oldest section of the work and formed the core around which the present A B text crystallized.1 Texts The original title of 3 Enoch appears to have been Seper Hekalot (The Book of the Palaces), but it has also been known as The Chapters of Rabbi Ishmael, and The Book of Rabbi Ishmael the High Priest; one manuscript refers to chapters 3-15 as 'The Elevation of Metatron.\" The name 3 Enoch was coined by H. Odeberg for his edition of 1928. The text of 3 Enoch is in considerable confusion. Odeberg's attempted critical edition has many serious flaws. The translation offered in the present study draws on the following manuscripts and editions (a number of which were unknown to Odeberg): Siglum Location A Vatican City: Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana 228/4 (Assemanus).

The Lemberg edition was reprinted at Warsaw in 1875, and the Warsaw edition at Piotrkow in 1883. The oldest printed text of 3 Enoch appears to be Deru§ Pirqe Hekalot. It covers 3:1-12:5 and 15:1-2, and is dated by A. E. Cowley (Catalogue of Hebrew Printed Books in the Bodleian Library [Oxford, 1929] p. 241) to around 1650. The translation of chapters 1-48A (except for 15B and 22BC) is based on B, despite the many errors of this manuscript, since the only critical edition of 3 Enoch available at present 1 MS D and DeruS Pirqe Hekalot both contain effectively only the account of the exaltation of Enoch (see below on \"Texts\"). The earliest surely attested section of 3En is chs. 3—15; these chs. may have circulated once under the name of R. Aqiba, and it was for this reason that a summary of them was included in the Alphabet of Aqiba (see below on \"Date\").

Particular weight has been given to manuscript A, since it belongs to the same textual tradition as B but gives superior readings. The base text for 15B and 22BC is manuscript C, as in Odeberg. For 15B the text-witnesses are C and Eleazar (see 15B, n. a); for 22B they are C, Maca£eh Merkabah, Hekalot Rabbati, and a Haggadic Fragment printed by Jellinek (see 22B, n. a); for 22C they are C, Eleazar, Macas*eh Merkabah, and the Haggadic Fragment (see 22C, n. a). The translation of 48BCD is based on Wert since B, which Odeberg prints, is hopelessly corrupt. For 48BCD the text witnesses are: A, B, E (for 48B only), F (for 48B only), G, Crac, Wert. A selection of variant readings is given in the notes. These readings are intended (1) to indicate the authority or authorities for departures from the base manuscripts, and (2) to record the more substantial variants. For ease of reference the numbering of chapters and verses follows Odeberg. The chapter numbers derive ultimately from manuscript B. A cautious attempt has been made to recover the original form of the A B recension of the text and so the obviously additional chapters 23-24 and 48BCD have been relegated to an appendix. The chapters numbered 15B and 22BC by Odeberg, which contain additional material not found in A or B, have also been put in this appendix. Original language 3 Enoch is written in Hebrew. The exact character of its language has never been investigated, though Odeberg's 'index to the Hebrew Text\" (3 Enoch, Pt. 4, pp. 3-18, esp. 14-18) provides a ready basis for analysis. There is no reason to suppose that the work has been translated into Hebrew from another language, such as Aramaic, in which some Merkabah traditions were written down. (Note, however, that the title \"great and honored prince\" in 18:5, 6 is in Aram.) There are loanwords from Latin (familia, 12:5) and Greek (e.g. glossokomon, 27:2). The style of 3 Enoch and of the related Merkabah literature is highly distinctive. It is marked by extreme redundancy: Note the piling up of synonyms in such a typical sentence as \"He enlightened my eyes and my heart to utter psalm, praise, jubilation, thanksgiving, song, glory, majesty, laud, and strength\" (1:12). It also indulges in the repeated use of such highly emotive words as \"glory, majesty, power, greatness\" (see e.g. 19:1), and it manifests a tendency to fall into rhythmic prose (see e.g. 22B:8). These characteristics of style find their ultimate expression in the Merkabah hymns. G. G. Scholem has aptly spoken of the \"polylogy\" of these compositions.2 They lie at the very heart of Merkabah mysticism and were almost certainly a feature of the Merkabah movement from an early stage; they formed part of the technique by which the adepts made their ascent to the Merkabah, and the practical function of their repetitiveness was to induce ecstasy (see below). It is probable that the redundant style belonged originally to the Merkabah hymns but came in the end to pervade the whole of the Merkabah literature.3 Date 3 Enoch—like a number of other Merkabah texts—is attributed to Rabbi Ishmael, the famous Palestinian scholar who died shortly before the outbreak of the Bar Kokhba War in 2 G. G. Scholem, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism, p. 60. Merkabah hymns are not, in fact, found in 3En. See further, A.

Singer, The Authorised Daily Prayer Book [London, 1962) p. 78). Also the benediction Yittabbah: \"Unto thee, O Lord our God, and God of our fathers, song and praise are becoming, hymn and psalm, strength and dominion, victory, greatness and might, renown and glory, holiness and sovereignty, blessings and thanksgivings from now even for ever\" (Singer. Authorised Prayer Book, p. 37; cf. E. D. Goldschmidt. The Passover Haggadah [Jerusalem, 1960] p. 135; see also b.Pes 118)."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"A.D. 132 (see 1:1, n. b). Though some of the traditions of 3 Enoch can be traced back to Ishmael's time (and even earlier), there can be no question of accepting this attribution at its face value; the work is a pseudepigraphon and Ishmael is simply the master whose authority the author or redactor of 3 Enoch wished to claim. The question of the real date of 3 Enoch has elicited from scholars very different answers. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, though 3 Enoch itself was not well known, the tendency was to assign the type of literature to which it belongs to the gaonic era (7th—11th cent. A.D.). This view gained currency through the influence of L. Zunz's Die gottesdienstlichen Vortrdge der Juden (Berlin, 1832; Frankfurt am Main, 18922)pp. 165-79. It was H. Graetz, however, who first tried to establish this position by detailed argument (see \"Die mystische Literatur in der gaonaischen Epoche,\" MGWJ 8 [1859] 67-78, 103-18, 140-53). Graetz reasoned that this Jewish mystical literature must be post-talmudic on the grounds that \"the leading ideas contained therein were unknown in the talmudic age, and would have been abhorrent to talmudic authorities\" (p. 104). In his view these Jewish mystical texts came into being in the ninth century under the influence of ideas current at that period in Islam. Thus he argued that the glorification of Enoch by the mystics (e.g. chs. 3-15), in contrast to his denigration in classic Midrashim (GenR 25:1; TargOnk to Gen 5:244), reflects the favorable attitude to Enoch in Islamic tradition, which identifies him with righteous Idris of the Koran (Sura 19.57/56-58/57; 21.85f.; Mascudi, Murudj3, ed. Meynard-Courteille, vol. 1, p. 73). The nub ofGraetz's case, however, was the contention that the crudely anthropomorphic doctrine of Sicur Qomah, found in the Jewish mystical literature (see below), is dependent on the teaching of Islamic mushabbiha sects, such as the Mughiriyya, followers of the heretic al-Mughira b. Sacid al-idjli (Shahrastani, Kitab al-Milal wal-Nihal, ed. Cureton, pt. 1 [1842] pp. 134f.; ed. Al-Wakil [Cairo, 1968] pp. 176-78; trans. Haar-briicker, vol. 1 [1851] pp. 203f.). Graetz's position is indefensible. There was no need to invoke Islam to explain the mystics' favorable views of Enoch; they were simply carrying on an indigenous Jewish tradition with its roots in Palestinian apocalyptic in the Maccabean period, if not earlier (see below). As for Sicur Qomah, Scholem and Lieberman have pointed to probable allusions to the doctrine already in the talmudic period (see below). H. Odeberg (3 Enoch) took a very different line from that of Graetz. He maintained that the earliest stratum of material in 3 Enoch (9:2-13:2, which appears to describe Metatron as a primordial being) dates from a time not later than the first century A.D. (pt. 1, p. 188). The main body of the text, however, chs. 3-48A, was redacted in the latter half of the third century A.D. The rest of the material (chs. 1-2, 15B, 22BC, and 48BC) is all pre-Islamic (pt. 1, pp. 41f.). Odeberg's main arguments are as follows: (1) A comparison of 3 Enoch with Hagigah 1 lb-16a suggests that 3 Enoch is not later than that text (pt. 1, p. 32). (2) The language of 3 Enoch is \"most akin to that of the earlier haggadic dicta of the Babylonian Talmud, or, in general, that of the dicta attributed to the tannaitic teachers and earlier Amoras\" (pt. 1, p., 37). (3) The reference to Samma'el, the Prince of Rome, and Dubbi'el, the Prince of Persia (26:12), points to the origin of the work in pre-Islamic times, when Rome and Persia divided the world between themselves (pt. 1, p. 37). (4) The irenic attitude of 3 Enoch toward the nations suggests a period of good relations with the ruling power such as the Jewish colonies in Babylonia enjoyed under Sassanian Persia in the third and fourth centuries A.D. (pt. 1, pp. 37f.). (5) The form of the QeduSSah in 3 Enoch takes us back to a time when it had not yet received any of the amplifications attested in the Gemara of the Babylonian Talmud, or been associated with the cAmidah (pt. 1, p. 38). (6) The reference to the Messiah, the son of Joseph, in 45:5 dates the document after the time of Hadrian (pt. 1, p. 38). (7) Similarly the reference to the pre-existence of the soul (ch. 43) \"may perhaps be taken as evidence for the origin of that section not much earlier than the beginning of the third century A.D.,\" if Billerbeck's opinion is correct that this idea first penetrated rabbinic Judaism then (pt. 1, pp. 38, 180). (8) The relationship which Odeberg perceived between 3 Enoch and the other Merkabah texts also played a part in his dating. He regarded 3 Enoch as one of the earliest of these texts, older, for example, than Hekalot Rabbati (pt. 2, pp. 54, 159), 4 However, the text of Onkelos at this point is not altogether certain; see I. Gruenwald, \"Knowledge and Vision,\" Israel Oriental Studies 3 (1973) 66, n. 20; P. S. Alexander, \"The Historical Setting of the Hebrew Book of Enoch,\" 775 28 (1977) 176, n. 40."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"and since he was still influenced by the nineteenth-century dating of this literature as post-talmudic, he tended to push 3 Enoch back into the talmudic period. These arguments are not all of equal weight. The fourth is subjective and of little value. The third is weak, though not entirely lacking in force. The fifth is interesting: It is certainly noteworthy that the forms of the QeduSSah in 3 Enoch are simpler than those used in the synagogue liturgy; but it is very doubtful whether we can deduce from this that the sections of 3 Enoch which quote the heavenly Sanctus originated before the synagogue QeduSSot were composed. The second argument looks as if it might provide a strong case, but Odeberg offers no evidence beyond bald assertion, and, in fact, our knowledge of rabbinic Hebrew is hardly so exact as to allow us to draw such a precise conclusion. Arguments six and seven are possibly correct, and may indicate a date (or dates) after which 3 Enoch must have been finally redacted.5 The crucial arguments are, however, the first and the eighth, and in both cases it seems that Odeberg made a fundamental misjudgment. As Scholem subsequently demonstrated, 3 Enoch is probably one of the later, not one of the earlier Merkabah texts. And while Odeberg was justified in maintaining that 3 Enoch contains traditions as old as, if not older than, talmudic Macaseh Merkabah, he failed to see that occasionally it makes use of talmudic material, and so its final editing is presumably post-talmudic.6 Scholem dates 3 Enoch to the fifth or sixth century A.D., though he concedes that \"much of the material is old and important\" (Gnosticism, p. 17, n. 19). He does not systematically argue his case;7 he surveys the Merkabah literature and offers a reconstruction of the development of Merkabah mysticism from the first to the tenth century A.D., and it is from this that his dating of 3 Enoch emerges. 3 Enoch is a highly complex and involved Merkabah text and so it should be assigned a place fairly late in the history of Merkabah mysticism (after Hekalot Zutarti and Hekalot Rabbati). Scholem maintains that \"3 Enoch already reinterprets, and wrongly, some older Merkabah traditions that a third-century writer could not have misunderstood\"8 (Gnosticism, p. 7, n. 19). The following appear to be examples of what he means by reinterpretation. (1) One of Metatron's most distinctive titles is Nacar. Originally this was used in the sense of \"servant\" and it referred to Metatron's role as the high priest of the heavenly sanctuary; its equivalent in one Aramaic text is sammdSd* rehtnuV = \"the beloved servant.\" (Cf. Metatron's common title cebed = \"servant\" [10:3].) In 3 Enoch 4, however, Ncfar is taken in the sense of \"Youth\" and linked with the notion that Metatron is translated Enoch: as the youngest of the angel-princes he is known among them as \"Youth\" (4:10) (Gnosticism, p. 66). (2) Another possible instance of reinterpretation is the name 'Azbogah. In origin this was a secret name of God, possibly related to the gnostic concept of the Ogdoad, the eighth heavenly sphere. ('Azbogah is made up of three groups of consonants, each of which adds up by gematria to eight.) But in 3 Enoch 18:22 'Azbogah has become simply the name of one of the angels, and it is taken as a kind of abbreviation (notarikon) for 'ozer bigde hayyim = \"the one who girds (the righteous) with the garments of life\" (Gnosticism, pp. 65f.). A very late date for 3 Enoch has recently been advanced by J. T. Milik.9 He holds that the work cannot have been composed earlier than the ninth or tenth century A.D., and that, in fact, the greater part of it was written between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries A.D. (pp. 126f.). His arguments run as follows: (1) 3 Enoch draws on 2 Enoch, which, in its Greek original, must be dated to the ninth or tenth century A.D. (2) On the incantation bowls 5 J. Heinemann, \"The Messiah of Ephraim and the Premature Exodus of the Tribe of Ephraim,\" HTR 68 (1975) 1-15, argues that the idea of the Messiah of Ephraim is pre-Hadrianic but that it underwent a transformation after the death of Bar Kokhba. On the pre-existence of the soul see E. E. Urbach, The Sages: Their Concepts and Beliefs (Jerusalem, 1975) vol. 1, p. 236: \"Support for this concept is to be found only in dicta of the Palestinian Amoraim of the second half of the third century.\" 6 See 4:6, n. I; 16:1-5, n. a; 31:2, n. e; 45:2, n. h. On the problem of the relationship of 3En to the Talmud see further below on \"Historical importance.\" 7 This is unfortunate. His arguments have to be culled from Major Trends, pp. 40-79. and from Gnosticism. It should be noted that Gnosticism gives earlier dates for the Hekalot texts than does Major Trends (see Gnosticism, p. 8). Thus in Major Trends, p. 45, Scholem appears to date 3En later than the 6th cent. A.D. The 5th/6th-cent. date assigned to it in Gnosticism presumably applies only to the bulk of the work (chs. 1-48A), and Scholem still stands by his view, put forward in Major Trends, p. 68, that the list of the seventy names of Metatron in 3En 48D is from the Gaonic era. 8 I.e. if Odeberg's 3rd-cent. date for 3En were correct. 9 J.

(3) The name Metatron is to be derived from the Latin metator, via Greek metator, mitator (p. 131). But this loanword could hardly have entered Hebrew and Judeo-Aramaic before the fifth or sixth century A.D., for it was then that Latin borrowings, especially of administrative and military terms, entered these languages en bloc (pp. 133f.). (4) 3 Enoch was influenced by the Arabic Hermetic tradition of the eighth to tenth centuries A.D. The Arabic Hermeticists identified Hermes with Enoch; the incantation bowls identify Hermes with Metatron. The author or redactor of 3 Enoch, receiving both these traditions, deduced that Enoch was the same as Metatron (p. 134). (5) \"Cabbalistic theories, including the figure of Metatron-Enoch in his role as lieutenant of God, do not appear in Western Europe until the twelfth century (A.D.)\" (p. 134). Milik's arguments will not stand up to close scrutiny. The first of them depends on a dating for 2 Enoch which does not command much scholarly assent, and it requires us to posit a close and exclusive relationship between 2 Enoch and 3 Enoch such as does not, in fact, exist. In the second argument Milik's dating of the incantation bowls is open to question. Many of the bowls cannot be dated with certainty, but those from Nippur (among which are some of our most informative texts on Metatron) were found in stratified deposits and have been dated archaeologically to the seventh century A.D. at the very latest.™ Moreover, the fact that Enoch is not identified with Metatron on the bowls proves little. It is unlikely that the circles from which 3 Enoch emanated were the same as those which produced the bowls. The failure of the magicians to equate Enoch and Metatron does not prove that the equation had not already been made by the Merkabah mystics either in Babylonia or in Palestine. As for the third argument, Milik is rather overconfident about the derivation of the angelic name Metatron from the Latin metator (see below). His assertion that metator can hardly have entered Judeo-Aramaic or Hebrew before the fifth or sixth century A.D. does not accord with the evidence: it is found in what would appear to be much earlier Jewish material.11 The appeal in Milik's fourth argument to Arabic Hermetic traditions to explain the equation between Metatron and Enoch is unnecessary. The identification can be explained as a natural development within the mystical tradition. It is very curious, if Milik is correct, that the impact of Arabic Hermeticism is not more evident in 3 Enoch or in the other Merkabah tracts. Out of the scores of names for Metatron found in the Merkabah traditions Hermes does not appear to be attested. Milik's final argument is simply mistaken. It assumes that 3 Enoch was written in western Europe. In fact it was almost certainly written in the East— either in Babylonia or in Palestine (see below on \"Provenance\"). It can be shown conclusively that the vast majority of the ideas contained in 3 Enoch, including the Enoch-Metatron doctrine, were known in both these centers long before the twelfth century A.D. It is impossible to reach a very firm conclusion as to the date of 3 Enoch. The main problem is the literary character of the work: it is not the total product of a single author at a particular point in time, but the deposit of a \"school tradition\" which incorporates elements from widely different periods. Certain rough chronological limits can, however, be estab­lished. (1) 3 Enoch can hardly have been written later than the tenth century A.D., since it is clear from the writings of Sa'adya, Sherira and Hai, and the Karaites Jacob al-Qirqisani and Salmon b. Yeruhim that the Merkabah literature was circulating widely among Rabbanites at that period and was regarded as being of considerable antiquity and authority.12 Particularly interesting is the fact that Jacob al-Qirqisani knew the short account of the elevation of 10 See J. A. Montgomery, Aramaic Incantation Texts from Nippur (Philadelphia, 1913) pp. 103f.; see further n. 18 below. \" The Latin metator is found in a dictum attributed to Eliezer b. Hyrcanus (late lst/early 2nd cent, A.D.) in SifDeut 338 (ed. Finkelstein, p. 388), on which see n. 17 below. It occurs also in a dictum which, according to GenR 5:4, was cited by R. Levi (late 3rd cent, A.D.) in the name of Ben Azzai and Ben Zoma (1st half of the 2nd cent. A.D.). The angelic name Metatron occurs in a dictum which Rab Nahman b. Isaac (died mid 4th cent, A.D.) attributed to Rab Idi (early 4th cent, A.D.) (b.Sanh 38b). Note also its occurrence in the 4th-cent. work Re'uyot Yehezqe'l, BM, vol. 2, p. 132 (ed. Gruenwald, p. 130). 12 Sacadya, see *Osar hagge*onim, ed. Lewin, Berakot, Responsa sec: p. 17; Sherira and Hai, see 'Osar hagge'onim (ed. Lewin, Hagigah.

This short account appears to be a summary of a longer version of the elevation of Enoch closely akin to 3 Enoch 3-15. (2) If we are right in surmising that 3 Enoch has drawn some of its materials from the Babylonian Talmud,13 then its final redaction can hardly be earlier than the fifth century A.D. (3) The magical bowls from Nippur show that many of 3 Enoch's ideas about Metatron and about the heavenly world were known in magical circles in the sixth and seventh centuries A.D. All things considered, then, though 3 Enoch contains some very old traditions and stands in direct line with developments which had already begun in the Maccabean era, a date for its final redaction in the fifth or the sixth century A.D. cannot be far from the truth.14 Provenance In the period to which we have dated 3 Enoch there appear to have been two main centers of Merkabah mysticism—Palestine and Babylonia.13 It is far from easy to determine in which of these two regions 3 Enoch was finally edited. The work draws extensively on Palestinian apocalyptic traditions about Enoch (see below), and some of its distinctive ideas can be paralleled in Palestinian sources; e.g. the identity of Enoch and Metatron is attested in one of the Palestinian Targumim (TarJon to Gen 5:24),16 and \"Mitatron\" occurs as a secret name of the prince of the third heaven in the fourth-century Palestinian work Re'uyot Yehezqe'l (BM, vol. 2, p. 132; ed. Gruenwald, p. 130).17 On the other hand, there are also close parallels to 3 Enoch in texts of Babylonian provenance. Metatron is mentioned a number of times in the incantation bowls from Babylonia, and invoked as \"the Great Prince,\" \"the Great Prince of God's Throne,\" \"the Great Prince of the Whole World\"; one Mandaean bowl speaks of \"Metatron . . . who serves before the curtain [brgwd*].\"1* There are three highly suggestive references to Metatron in the Babylonian Talmud (b.Sanh 38b; b.Hag 15a; b.AZ 3b). Particularly significant is the close relationship between the account of the humbling of Metatron in 3 Enoch 16 and that in Hagigah 15a. If, as seems to be the case, this story is of Babylonian origin, then it is reasonable to locate the final redaction of 3 Enoch in Babylonia.19 Historical importance Classic rabbinic literature makes it clear that there was an esoteric doctrine in talmudic Judaism. It was concerned with two subjects—the Account of Creation (Macafeh Bere'sit) 13 See n. 6 above. 14 I. Gruenwald is of the opinion that 3En may be later than the 6th cent, A.D., though he agrees that it contains much older material, some of which may go back to the 2nd or 3rd cent, A.D., or even earlier; see \"Jewish Sources for the Gnostic Texts from Nag Hammadi?\" Proceedings of the Sixth World Congress of Jewish Studies (Jerusalem, 1977) vol. 3, p. 50. 15 In the Middle Ages Merkabah texts were known in Europe and North Africa. Several Merkabah texts were discovered in the Cairo Genizah (Re'uyot Yehezqe'l, a Hekalot text, a fragment of Si'ur Qomah, and the related magical tract Seper HaRazim). In the 10th cent. Si*ur Qomah texts were known to the Jews of Fez in Morocco (Responsum of Sherira and Hai, *Osar hagge'onim, [ed. Lewin, Hagigah, Responsa sec, pp. 10-12]). Merkabah mysticism may have been known in southern Italy as early as the 9th cent, A.D.; by the 10th it was known in the Rhineland; and by the 13th in Spain. What we cannot be certain of is when the Merkabah teachings first began to spread from the East to the West, and how exactly they were transmitted. 16 Cf. TarJon to Deut 34:6. These two references to Metatron probably belong to a late stratum of the Targum; the other two recensions of the Palestinian Targum make no reference to Metatron. It is well known that the final redaction of TarJon to the Pentateuch cannot have been earlier than the 7th cent, A.D., because of the allusion to a wife and daughter of Mohammed in Gen 21:21. 17 SifDeut 338 (ed. Finkelstein, p. 388) does not allude to Metatron the archangel, contrary to what Odeberg, 3 Enoch, pt. 1, pp. 91f., supposes: see Alexander, JJS 28 (1977) 163, n. 15. 18 For the texts see Montgomery, Aramaic Incantation Texts from Nippur, C.

It must be stressed that the decipherment of these texts is often acutely problematic; cf. with Montgomery's readings the readings proposed by J. N. Epstein, \"Gloses babylo-arameens,\" REJ 73 (1921) 27-58; 74 (1922) 40-72. For discussion, see B. A. Levine, \"The Language of the Magical Bowls,\" in J.

All study and discussion of these topics in public was banned.20 The Mishnah rules that \"the Account of Creation may not be expounded before two or more persons, nor the Chariot before even one, unless he is a scholar who understands of his own knowledge\" (m.Hag 2:1). Those who ignored these injunctions did so at their peril. The story was told of a certain Galilean who announced that he would publicly lecture on the Merkabah, but who was stung by a wasp and died (b.Shab 80b). A young scholar who dabbled prematurely in chariot lore was said to have been smitten with leprosy (y.Hag 77a.46); another perceived the haSmal and was consumed by fire (b.Hag 13a). Despite efforts to keep Merkabah teaching secret, we are not entirely in the dark as to its contents in the talmudic period; some elements of it are disclosed. The most extensive single text in classical rabbinic literature Hagigah lib-16a. This gives an account of the seven heavens and their contents (strictly a motif of Maca£eh Bere'Sit), discusses the safeguards to be applied in studying and teaching Maca$eh Merkabah, and relates stories of the great masters and adepts. The ideas which are explicitly put forward in Hagigah lib-16a can hardly be the sum total of talmudic Merkabah mysticism; in view of the Mishnaic ruling it is reasonable to suppose that there were more esoteric doctrines which have not been made public. These deeper teachings are hinted at in a number of places. One of these is the story of the four who entered Pardes: Four entered Pardes, and these are they: Ben Azzai, Ben Zoma, 3Aher, and Rabbi Aqiba. Rabbi Aqiba said to them: When you reach the stones of pure marble do not say, \"Water! Water!\" for it is written, \"He that speaks falsehood shall not be established before my eyes\" (Ps 101:7). Ben Azzai looked and died: Scripture says of him, \"Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints\" (Ps 116:15). Ben Zoma looked and went mad: Scripture says of him, \"Have you found honey? Eat so much as is sufficient for you lest you be sated with it and vomit it up\" (Prov 25:16). 'Aher cut down the young plants. Rabbi Aqiba went out in peace.21 Pardes is a designation of the place to which the souls of the righteous go after death.22 Here, however, the reference cannot be to the final departure of the souls of the four to that blissful abode; it must allude to a mystical entry into Pardes which took place while they were still alive; note how Aqiba not only enters but comes out again.23 Pardes was sometimes located on earth, sometimes in heaven. Which of these traditions lies behind this passage cannot now be determined with certainty; however, a reference to a celestial Pardes is likely. The parallel in 2 Corinthians 12:1-7 points in this direction, and it is evident that—whatever its original meaning—the text was already being read in amoraic times in terms of a mystical ascent to heaven. Its setting in the Gemara should be noted; it occurs in a context dealing with the heavenly world, and in Hagigah 15a the enigmatic remark about 'Aher cutting down the young plants is apparently explained by a story about an encounter between 'Aher and the angel Metatron which is supposed to have taken place \"on high,\" i.e. in heaven 20 m.Hag 2:1 also forbids public discussion of the laws regarding incest: see P. S. Alexander, \"The Rabbinic Lists of Forbidden Targumim,\" JJS 27 (1976) 185. 21 b.Hag 14b. The parallels contain a number of variants: see t.Hag 2:3-4; y.Hag 77b.8-23; SongR 1:4.1. For discussion see A. Neher, \"Le voyage mystique des quatre,\" RHR 140 (1951) 59-82; Scholem, Major Trends, pp. 52f.; Scholem, Gnosticism, pp. 14-19; I. Gruenwald, \"Yannai and Hekhaloth Literature,\" Tarbis 36 (1966/67) 261-65; E. E. Urbach, \"The Traditions About Merkabah Mysticism in the Tannaitic Period,\" Festschrift Scholem (1967) Heb. sec, pp. 12-16. 22 Usually this place is referred to as Gan 'Eden in rabbinic literature; see 3En 5:5, n. f. Another suggestion is that Pardes is a cryptic designation for mystical or metaphysical speculation, this term having been chosen because it was in Paradise that the tree of knowledge was to be found (Gen 2:17) (Strack-Billerbeck, vol. 4, p. 1119; Scholem, Major Trends, p. 361, n. 45). \"To enter Pardes,\" then, would mean to engage in a certain kind of esoteric study. In biblical and rabbinic Heb. pardes means \"a park,\" \"a garden\" (Neh 2:8; Eccl 2:5; Song 4:13; t.BMes 1:10; b.Sot 10a). Like the Gk. paradeisos (the root of the English \"paradise\"), it is derived from the Persian pairidaeza, \"an enclosure.\" See further I. de Vuippens, Le paradis au troisiime ciel (Paris, 1925); Strack-Billerbeck, vol. 4, pp. 118-1165; H. Bietenhard, Die himmlische Welt im Urchristentum und Spatjudentum (Tubingen, 1951) pp. 161-85. 23 The ending of the story in the Yerusalmi Talmud, the Tosepta (Erfurt MS), and SongR is clear on this point: \"R. Aqiba entered in peace and went out in peace.\" The version in the Babylonian Talmud abbreviates. The Vienna MS of the Tosepta has an interesting variant: \"R. Aqiba ascended in peace and descended in peace.\""},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"(cf. 3En 16).24 If this interpretation of the story of the four who entered Pardes is correct, then it would seem that in talmudic times Maca£eh Merkabah contained a doctrine of mystical ascent to heaven. Another element of the Merkabah tradition in the talmudic period may be disclosed by an early rabbinic gloss on 1 Samuel 6:12. Rabbinic exegetes derived the unusual verbal form wayyiSSarnah in 1 Samuel 6:12 not from the rootyir in the sense of \"go straight,\" but from syr, \"to sing.\" They took the text to mean that the cows sang a hymn as they pulled the cart bearing the Ark of the Covenant back along the road from Philistia to Israel. Various suggestions were made as to the song they sang; some identified it with the Song at the Sea (Ex 15), others with biblical Psalms (Pss 93, 98, 99), but the Palestinian haggadist R. Isaac Nappaha (mid 3rd cent, A.D.) stated that it was a non-biblical composition which ran as follows: Rejoice, rejoice, acacia shrine, Flaunt yourself in your abundant glory, Bound in embroideries of gold, Praised in the sanctum of the Temple, Resplendent in the finest of ornaments.25 As Scholem has pointed out, the whole force of this exegesis turns upon an allusion to the Merkabah hymns: Just as the hayyot (the holy creatures) bearing up the Merkabah sing hymns to the Merkabah, so the kine bearing up the Ark sang hymns to the Ark. The song of the kine has a number of affinities to some of the surviving Merkabah hymns (see Hekalot Rabbati 2:4, BHM, vol. 3, p. 84; Cairo Genizah Hekalot B/l, 33, ed. Gruenwald, p. 369). It would appear, then, that R. Isaac and his audience were acquainted with hymns of the Merkabah type and with their mystical setting.26 A patristic text appears to indicate that students of Maca$eh Merkabah were already speculating in the talmudic period on the mystical body of God. In the prologue of his commentary on the Song of Songs (cf. Jerome, Commentary on Ezekiel 1 Praefatio, and Epistle 53, ad Paulinum), Origen informs us that in his day Jews did not study the beginning of Genesis, the beginning and end of Ezekiel, and the Song of Songs, until they had mastered the rest of Scripture and the oral law. Scholem has argued that the inclusion of the Song of Songs along with these other mystical texts shows that already in the early third century A.D. Sicur Qomah speculation had been attached to the description of the Beloved in the Song of Songs 5:10-16 (cf. Hekalot Rabbati 12, BM, vol. 1, p. 87: Merkabah Selemah 38a). An analysis of certain tannaitic and amoraic statements about the Song of Songs undertaken by Lieberman tends to confirm Scholem's view.27 From this discussion it seems reasonable to conclude that, in addition to the explicit teachings given in Hagigah and in other classic rabbinic texts, Merkabah mysticism in the talmudic period contained the following three elements:(l) an idea of mystical ascent to heaven; (2) Merkabah hymns; and (3) speculation of the Sicur Qomah type. It is clear, then, that all the leading ideas in the Merkabah tracts such as Hekalot Rabbati and 3 Enoch were already present in Merkabah mysticism in the talmudic period. An important question now arises: What is the relationship between the talmudic Merkabah texts and the Merkabah tracts? Two views are possible. On the one hand we could argue that the mystical tracts are post-talmudic and have grown out of attempts to understand and to explain talmudic Maca£eh 24 Later Jewish scholars certainly interpreted the story as referring to an ascent to heaven: see Hai, 'Osar hagge'onim, ed. Lewin, Hagigah, Responsa sec, pp. 13-15, and esp. p. 14; Rabbenu Hanan'el to b.Hag 14b (cf. 'Aruk haSSalem under pardes); Rashi to b.Hag 14b; Tosapot to b.Hag 14b, niknesu. 25 So b.AZ 24b; the parallels have a number of important variations: see GenR 54:4; Seder 'Eliyahu Rabbah 12 (11) (ed. Friedmann, p. 58); MidraS Semu'el 12:3 (ed. Buber, p. 40). 26 Scholem, Gnosticism, pp. 20-30; I. Gruenwald, 44A Technique of the Midrash: Linkage by Sound-Patterns,\" Ha-Sifrut 1 (1968/69) 726 (in Heb.). J. Goldin, The Song at the Sea (New Haven, 1971) pp. 80f., suggests that there are some ancient hymnic fragments embedded in Mekilta' deRabbi 'ISma'el, Sirah 1 (ed. Horovitz-Rabin, p. 119). The hymns he reconstructs are in some respects similar to the Merkabah hymns. 27 See Scholem, Gnosticism, pp. 38-40; Lieberman, app. D in Scholem's Gnosticism, esp. p. 123. For an application of Song 5:10-16 very explicitly to God see Mekilta' deRabbi 'Isma'el, Sirah 3 (ed. Horovitz-Rabin, p. 127); Goldin, The Song at the Sea, pp. 115-20. Scholem's suggestion (Gnosticism, p. 40) that the reference to the \"length of the nose being as the length of the little finger\" in b.Bek 44a is a quotation from the Si'ur Qomah (cf. Merkabah Selemah 38a; Lieberman, Shkiin [Jerusalem, 19702] p. 12) is unconvincing."},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"Merkabah materials. Or we could argue that the Merkabah tracts and the talmudic Merkabah texts belong to one unbroken mystical movement and that in some cases the traditions in the mystical tracts may go back to the talmudic period or may even be anterior to the talmudic Merkabah traditions. Of these two views the second seems to fit the facts better. There are many elements in the Merkabah tracts (such as 3 Enoch's account of the elevation of Enoch)28 which cannot easily be explained as Midrashim on talmudic Macageh Merkabah; clearly the writers of the tracts had access to Merkabah traditions other than those contained in classic rabbinic sources. Moreover, in certain cases the mystical tracts appear to contain in fuller form traditions alluded to only obscurely in the Talmud. For example, the statement attributed to R. Aqiba in the story of the four who entered Pardes, \"When you reach the stones of pure marble do not say, 'Water! Water!' for it is written, 'He that speaks falsehood shall not be established before my eyes,' \" has baffled exegetes both ancient and modern. Parallels to it, however, are found in the mystical tracts Hekalot Zutarti and Hekalot Rabbati, and there it is stated that Aqiba's remark refers to a stage in the ascent of the mystic to the Merkabah: When he reaches the sixth palace he sees a glittering pavement of pure marble flags, and it seems to him that they are waves of water threatening to swallow him up. He must be careful, however, not to cry out, \"Water! Water!\" for by uttering this falsehood he lays himself open to angelic attack. Though at certain points later elements may have crept into the tradition in Hekalot Zutarti and Hekalot Rabbati about the stones of pure marble, Scholem is surely right in seeing here the key to the enigmatic talmudic statement. If this is so, then it follows that in this case the mystical tracts contain Merkabah material as old as that in the Talmud.29 It would seem, then, that Merkabah mysticism was a movement which continued in unbroken existence from tannaitic to gaonic times. The movement originated in Palestine. This may be deduced from a number of facts. Merkabah doctrines are found in early Palestinian texts (e.g. t.Hag 2:1-6 and y.Hag 2, 77a). We should also note that the four who entered Pardes—Ben Zoma, Ben Azzai, Aqiba, and Elisha b. Abuya (3Aher)—were all Palestinian scholars of the second century A.D. Merkabah literature itself claims Palestinian roots, for it cites as its authorities Tannaim belonging mainly to the circle of Yohanan b. Zakkai's disciples. Some of the surviving Merkabah texts contain what would appear to be identifiably Palestinian elements. Thus 3 Enoch's Metatron embodies Palestinian apocalyptic traditions about Enoch. In a vivid description of the guardian angels of the seventh palace Hekalot Rabbati refers to \"the mangers of Caesarea\" (presumably those attached to the hippodrome at Caesarea Maritima, Josephus, Ant 16.137), to the \"gate of Caesarea,\" and to the \"water-pipe in the Valley of Kidron\" near Jerusalem (Hekalot Rabbati 16:1-2, BUM, vol. 3, pp. 94f.). The story about R. Hananyah b. Teradyon and Lupinus Caesar in Hekalot Rabbati 5-6 (BHM, vol. 3, pp. 87f., BM, vol. 1, pp. 80f.) is also, in all probability, of Palestinian origin. Merkabah mysticism spread from Palestine to the Jewish communities in Babylonia; cultural contacts between the two centers were close, so it is not difficult to see how the Merkabah ideas could have been carried to Babylonia.30 We have already remarked on the presence of Merkabah materials in texts of Babylonian provenance such as the Babylonian Talmud and the incantation bowls. It is a fact that the Merkabah traditions in the Babylonian Talmud are richer and fuller than those in the classic Palestinian rabbinic texts (cf. y.Hag 2, 77a with b.Hag lib-16a). There are two possible explanations of this fact: it is possible that the Babylonian mystics were less inhibited than their Palestinian counterparts about disclosing the contents of Maca£eh Merkabah; or else the Babylonian Talmud may contain further developments of the Merkabah tradition which originated among the Babylonian mystics. 28 It is well known that classic rabbinic sources have very little to say about Enoch: he is not mentioned even once in the two Talmuds or the tannaitic Midrashim (see Ginzberg, Legends, vol. 5, p. 156, n. 58); the references to him in GenR are generally denigratory. 29 See Major Trends, pp. 52f.; Gnosticism, pp. 14-16; see further Gruenwald, Tarbis 36 (1966/67) 262-66; Urbach, Scholem Festschrift, pp. 15-17. Hai Gaon had already explained the talmudic text from Hekalot Zutarti in the 10th cent.: see 'Osar hagge'onim, ed. Lewin, Hagigah, Responsa sec, p. 14, and cf. Rabbenu Hanan'el to b.Hag 14b. 30 E.g. the Babylonian scholar Rab (early 3rd cent, A.D.), who appears to have had an interest in esoteric lore, studied in Palestine, and the Palestinian Isaac Nappaba, who quoted the song of the kine (see n. 25 above), was in Babylonia for some time."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"The Merkabah mystics came to be known as Yorede Merkabah, \"those who descend to the Chariot,\"31 and in certain cases they appear to have been organized into regular conventicles. From a close reading of the Merkabah literature it is possible to sketch the profile of these conventicles. Particularly valuable is Hekalot Rabbati 13-18 (BHM, vol. 3, pp. 93-97), which appears to be a thinly disguised description of a Merkabah stance. Each group was gathered round a master who not only initiated his disciples into the mystical lore, but demonstrated the ascent to the Merkabah. The achieving of a \"vision of the Merkabah\" (sepiyyat hammerkabah) (see 3En 1:1), either by the master himself or by another adept in the group, was probably the central act of a session of a conventicle.32 The technique of the ascent had two aspects. First, preparation: For some days prior to the ascent the adept made himself ready by fasting, eating special food, or bathing (Responsum of Hai Gaon, 'Osar hagge^onim, ed. Lewin, Hagigah, Responsa sec, p. 14; Ma'aSeh Merkabah 19, ed. Scholem, p. Ill; cf. Seper HaRazim 2:6-11, ed. Margalioth, p. 81). Secondly, there was the ascent itself. This was effected by the recitation of (1) Merkabah hymns or prayers (Maca£eh Merkabah 27, ed. Scholem, p. 113); (2) magic formulae; or (3) invocations of God or of the archangels by magical names (Hekalot Rabbati 14:4, BHM, vol. 3, p. 94).33 These hymns, prayers, formulae, and invocations have one thing in common: they all involve the rhythmic repetition of certain words, or sounds, or ideas. Given the rigorous preparations for the ascent, the sense of anticipation and the aura of mystery and awe with which the act was surrounded, this repetition would have been potent enough to have sent the adepts into trance. Its efficacy would have been magnified if, as Hai Gaon asserts, the mystics recited the hymns with their heads between their knees, in the manner of Elijah on Mount Carmel (cf. IKgs 18:42), thus constricting their breathing.34 The Merkabah texts stress the dangers of the ascent: To reach the throne of God the mystic had to pass through seven gates guarded by awesome archangels. He must have the right \"seals\" to show them and he must know the names of the angels (Hekalot Rabbati 15 and 17, BHM, vol. 3, pp. 94f.; Ma'aSeh Merkabah 23, ed. Scholem, p. 112; cf. 3En 48D:5). The sixth gate was regarded as especially perilous (Hekalot Rabbati 17:6, BHM, vol. 3, p. 96). The adept had to be marked by certain qualities and he had to make the ascent in a condition of ritual and spiritual purity (Responsum of Hai Gaon, Osar hagge^onim, ed.

Hekalot Rabbati 18:2 (BHM, vol. 3, p. 96) describes an elaborate technique for terminating a trance which was probably used when things appeared to be going awry.35 31 For the expression Yorede Merkabah see Hekalot Rabbati 9:2 {BHM. vol. 3, p. 90, 1. 18); 10 (p. 91, 1. 14); 16:3 (p. 95, 1. 8); 17:6 (p. 96, 1. 22); 18:4 (p. 97, 1. 11); 26:1 (BM, vol. 1, p. 107, 1. 11 = BHM. vol. 3, p. 102, 1. 11); Cairo Genizah Hekalot A/2, 11. 3, 8 (ed. Gruenwald, p. 361); cf. Seder Rab Amram Gaon, ed. N. N. Coronel (Warsaw, 1865) pt. 1, p. 4a, with 9:2 above. (The passage is not in the edition of Hedegard. Note also p. 4b, which inserts Merkabah material.) Hekalot Rabbati uses the terms \"fellowship\" (hab&rdh) (see 18:1, BHM, vol. 3, p. 96, 1. 28) and \"members of the fellowship\" (haberim) (see 18:4, TBHM, vol. 3, p. 97, 1. 17; 5:2, BHM, vol. 3, p. 87, 1. 21) with regard to the mystical groups. From such expressions as hayyored lammerkabah (Hekalot Rabbati 20:1, BHM, vol. 3, p. 98, 1. 14) and lered lammerkabah {BHM, vol. 3, p. 102, 1. 9; BM, vol. 1, p. 107, 1. 9, reads lered bammerkdbdh) it is clear that Yorede Merkabah means \"those who descend to the chariot.\" The expression \"descend to the Merkabah\" is odd; the mystical tracts speak also of \"ascending\": see e.g. Hekalot Rabbati 16:3 (BHM, vol. 3, p. 95, 1. 8): \"All the masters of the Yorede Merkabah were ascending and were not being harmed, and they were seeing all this palace [i.e. the 7th palace], and were descending in peace.\" Scholem suggests that the liturgical phrase \"go down before the Ark\" (ydrad lipne hattebdh) may have influenced the terminology of \"descending\" to the Merkabah: see Major Trends, pp. 46f., and Gnosticism, p. 20, n. 1. 32 See further Alexander, JJS 28 (1977) 169-73. 33 See further Gruenwald, Israel Oriental Studies 3 (1973) 89f. 34 \"He [the mystic] sits fasting for a specified period of time and places his head between his knees and whispers earthwards many hymns and praises ...\" ('Osar hagge'onim, ed. Lewin, Hagigah, Responsa sec, p. 14). Cf. the posture of Haninah b. Dosa in b.Ber 34b. 35 Scholem, Gnosticism, pp. 10-12; L. H. Schiffman, \"The Recall of Rabbi Nebuniah b.

Maier,4 4 Das Gefa hrdungsmoti v bei der Himmelsreise in der judischen Apokalyptik und in der 'jiidischen Gnosis.\"' Kairos 5 (1963) 18-40. The mystical ascent is compared to climbing a ladder in Hekalot Rabbati 13:2 (BHM, vol. 3, p. 93, 1. 11) and 20:3 (p. 98, 1. 31). According to Pereq mippirqe hekalot (BHM, vol. 3, p. 162, 1. 12), the angels ascend a ladder to reach the throne of glory. There may be an allusion to Jacob's ladder (Gen 28:12); however, the ladder is a common mystical symbol: see A. Altmann, \"The Ladder of Ascension,\" Festschrift Scholem (1967) pp. 1-32; E. R. Dodds, Pagan and Christian in an Age of Anxiety (Cambridge, 1965) pp. 50-53."},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"According to Hekalot Rabbati 18:4 (BHM, vol. 3, p. 97) the adept was expected to speak during the trance and scribes were placed to write down what he said, for his utterances were taken to be revelations of what was happening in the heavenly world. It is not clear whether any of these utterances have been incorporated directly into the Merkabah texts; it is possible that some of the angelic names and magical formulae are glossolalia.36 Most of the material, however, probably arose from later reflection, by the adept himself, or by other members of his fellowship, on his trance experiences. These vivid experiences clearly cried out for some interpretation, and this was usually supplied by attempting to correlate them with Ezekiel's vision of the Merkabah. Scholem and Gruenwald have published certain physiognomic texts which apparently emanated from the Merkabah circles. It would seem from these that, like the Pythagoreans (at least according to Iamblichus, De vita Pythagorica 17.71, 74) and possibly also the Qumran Essenes, the Merkabah mystics controlled entrance to their conventicles by using physiognomy. A number of influential talmudic sages are known to have studied the Merkabah lore, so it would appear that the mystical movement was at home at the very heart of rabbinic Judaism. The Merkabah texts as they stand may be described broadly as 4'orthodox'' in that they remain within the bounds of monotheism and pay due respect to Torah. However, there are clear signs that at least some rabbinic authorities were uneasy about Merkabah mysticism. It is possible that their concern was occasioned by a more extreme form of the teaching than we And in the extant texts. On the other hand it must be admitted that there is enough in the surviving literature to provoke misgivings. In the first place, the practice of mystical ascent to God's throne is potentially dangerous to rabbinic Judaism. It is not at all clear why the adepts wanted to make the ascent to the Merkabah. In some cases the motive may have been purely religious: They wished to view the glory of God and to join in the heavenly QeduSSah (cf. 3En 1:11). Sometimes, however, they were convinced that the exercise would bring them very mundane benefits: They would discover what was about to happen in the world; they would see all that men do, even in their innermost chambers; they would gain the protection of the heavenly law court (Hekalot Rabbati 1:1-2:2, BHM, vol. 3, pp. 83f.). The adepts appear to have functioned on occasion like the pagan oracles and the pagan and Christian prophets of late antiquity. An interesting example of a typically oracular use of an adept is found in Hekalot Rabbati 5:5 (BM, vol. 1, p. 74).37 There we are told that when Rome issued a decree to seize the leading Jewish scholars in Palestine, R. Nehunyah b. Ha-Qanah sent R. Ishmael down to the Merkabah to inquire of SurPel, Prince of the Divine Presence, why this had been allowed to happen. So long as the adepts confined themselves to pronouncements on non-controversial matters there was little danger. If, however, they had begun to pronounce on ultimate issues, they could have come to be regarded as channels of revelation on a par with the written and the oral law. Pagan theurgists certainly exploited mediums as a way of discovering ultimate truths, and the Christian Montanists apparently collected the oracles of their prophets into a sort of Third Testament, equal in authority to the Old and New Testaments. Just as the Montanist principle of continuous revelation posed a serious threat to the Christian estab­lishment, so too the Merkabah mystics, by resorting to ecstatic experience, could have threatened the stability of rabbinic Judaism with its commitment to the sufficiency of Torah. It is not clear whether there was ever any attempt to impose an absolute ban on Merkabah mysticism in rabbinic circles, but strong efforts were certainly directed toward containing it: It was hedged about with safeguards and clamped firmly in a vise of orthodoxy. It was to be studied only by mature scholars (m.Hag 2:1; b.Hag 14a). According to Hekalot Rabbati 20:1 (BHM, vol. 3, p. 98) only those who have mastered Bible, Mishnah, Halakot, and Haggadot, and who observe all the laws revealed to Moses on Sinai, are allowed to descend to the Merkabah. This stress on the classical disciplines as a necessary propaedeutic was doubtless aimed at neutralizing the danger inherent in the mystics' practice of ascending to the throne of God; the mystics' minds would have been so imbued with an orthodox world view that they would have tended to assign orthodox values to their mystical experiences. 36 A similar suggestion has been made about some of the formulae and unintelligible names in the magical papyri; see Dodds, Pagan and Christian, p. 55, n. 1. 37 See BM, vol. 1, p. 74, n. 25; the text in BHM, vol. 3, p. 87, is rather different."},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"It was not only the mystics' methods but also some of their doctrines which caused concern. It is noteworthy that two out of the three references to Metatron in the Talmud are critical; some of the rabbis apparently thought that the position assigned to him, at least by some mystics, amounted to dualism (see b.Sanh 38b; b.Hag 15a; the neutral reference is b.AZ 3b). This is hardly surprising in view of the title \"The lesser YHWH\" which Metatron carries in the mystical literature (see 3En 12:5). Moreover, the extreme glorification of Enoch in certain mystical circles (cf. 3En 3-15) stands in pointed contrast to the striking silence about him in the two Talmuds and the hostile notices of him in classic Midrashim.38 It is possible to detect signs of uneasiness about the Merkabah traditions in our current texts of 3 Enoch. There appears to have been an orthodox tendency at work in the redaction of this tract. There are several attempts to diminish the powers of Metatron: 3 Enoch 16 contains a version of the humbling of Metatron (cf. b.Hag 15a), and there is an \"orthodox\" gloss aimed at demoting Metatron in 3 Enoch 10:3. It is possible that the marked absence of theurgy in 3 Enoch is to be explained in the same way. We are nowhere told in 3 Enoch how to make the ascent to the throne (the ascent itself is covered in one verse, 3En 1:1), and there is a striking lack of Merkabah hymns. It is even possible that a list of the seventy names of Metatron (which could have been used to invoke him) has been edited out of 3 Enoch 4:1 (see ch. 16, n. a). A large number of elements in the Merkabah texts can be paralleled in apocalyptic literature, and yet, despite these shared traditions, the ethos of Merkabah mysticism is rather different from that of apocalyptic. The Merkabah texts concentrate overwhelmingly on the mysteries of heaven and on the description of God's throne: They show little interest in eschatological themes such as the last judgment, the resurrection of the dead, the messianic kingdom, and the world to come, all of which figure in classic apocalyptic. The differentiation is a matter of emphasis. The Merkabah texts do have some eschatology (see e.g. 3En 45:5), and apocalyptic literature does contain Maca£eh Merkabah (see e.g. lEn 14:8-25); but there is definitely much less eschatological interest in the Merkabah texts than in apocalyptic literature. So, too, we find cosmology treated in both kinds of text (see e.g. lEn 72-80 and 3En 18:4—7; 41-42); on the whole, however, cosmology bulks larger in apocalyptic than in Merkabah mysticism. In the talmudic period the tendency was to regard cosmology as belonging to a distinct though related esoteric tradition—to Maca£eh Bere'Sit rather than to Maca$eh Merkabah. Finally, we should note that although there is some evidence (particularly in later apocalyptic texts) that trances were experienced by the apocalyptists and that trance-inducing techniques were occasionally used by them, the theurgic element is much more explicit and overt in the Merkabah tradition: A number of the Merkabah treatises are taken up largely with the techniques for ascending to the throne of glory.39 Maca$eh Merkabah forms one of the strands of apocalyptic literature prior to A.D. 70; what is not clear, however, is whether at that period it was studied without reference to eschatology and had a literature and tradition of its own. It is tempting to argue that Merkabah mysticism did not have a separate existence outside of apocalyptic till after A.D. 70 and that it was the events of the years A.D. 70-135 in Palestine which brought about a reorientation of apocalyptic and gave rise to a more or less independent Merkabah movement. It is interesting to note that Hekalot Rabbati 13:1 (BHM, vol. 3, p. 93) appears to place the birth of the Merkabah movement just prior to the destruction of the Temple in A.D. 70. The destruction of the Temple removed a powerful, visible symbol of the divine presence and could have fostered the transcendent view of God that we find in the Merkabah texts. The war against Rome also dampened eschatological fervor: Messianic hopes were signally dashed and soberer spirits must surely have turned their backs on the apocalyptic fanaticism that had so aggravated the disasters of the Jewish people.40 Apocalyptic hopes were shattered further sixty years later with the debacle of Bar Kokhba and the conversion of Jerusalem into 38 GenR 25:1; TargOnk to Gen 5:24; see n. 4 above. 39 For theurgy in apocalyptic see Gruenwald, Israel Oriental Studies 3 (1973) 89f.; and for an attempt to characterize Merkabah mysticism and apocalyptic see I. Gruenwald, \"The Jewish Esoteric Literature in the Time of the Mishnah and the Talmud,\" Immanuel 4 (1974) 37-46. 40 This new coolness toward eschatological hopes is perhaps classically illustrated by the dictum attributed to Yobanan b. Zakkai: \"If you have a sapling in your hand, and it is said to you, 'Behold, there is the Messiah1—go on with your planting, and afterwards go out and receive him. And if the youths say to you, 'Let us go up and build the Temple,' do not listen to them ...\" (ARN B 31, ed. Schechter, 34a)."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"a pagan city. As a result it is possible that in certain circles the eschatological element in apocalyptic was played down and a form of the tradition arose which was much less concerned with the future and more interested in the mysteries of the heavenly world. It can hardly be disputed that the destruction of the Temple in A.D. 70 created a profound crisis in apocalyptic, and it may have given an impetus to Merkabah mysticism, but we should note—in opposition to the view we have just put forward—that in the Angelic Liturgy from Qumran (4QSirSabb) we may have a pre-70 text devoted exclusively to classic Maca£eh Merkabah themes. If this is so—and we cannot be certain since the text is so fragmentary—then it would seem that already in the period before the destruction of the Temple, Maca$eh Merkabah had a literature of its own and was being treated as a subject in its own right.4' Our sketch of the development of Merkabah mysticism would be incomplete if we were to see it only in the light of Jewish religious history. To do so would be to lose sight of the important fact that it displays a number of affinities with certain non-Jewish religious world views of late antiquity. Undoubtedly the closest parallels are with Gnosticism. Indeed, Scholem has argued that Merkabah mysticism is to be regarded as \"Jewish Gnosticism\" (Gnosticism, pp. 2-3, 10). \"Gnosticism\" is notoriously difficult to define, for there are many variations in detail between the various gnostic systems, but a typical system would speak of God as a transcendent, supreme power; of a second power (sometimes called the demiurge) that created the world; of a series of spheres (or aeons) separating man from the supreme power, each under the control of a hostile spirit (or archon); of the divinity of the human soul and its ascent to the supreme power; and of the secret knowledge (gnosis) by which this ascent is to be achieved. In its broad outlines this structure invites comparison with the Merkabah texts. These speak of a transcendent God, and of God who reveals himself on the throne of glory; God as he reveals himself is sometimes referred to as Yoser BerPsit, \"the Creator\" (cf. 3En 11:1). Separating God and man are a series of regions controlled by angels whose business it is to stop man from approaching God. The Merkabah texts also speak of the heavenly origin of the human soul (3En 43:3), and of an ascent to heaven, and they claim that they contain the secret of how this ascent can be made. It has long been observed that there is a strong Jewish component in Gnosticism.42 In some cases the Jewish elements in Gnosticism can be found also in the Merkabah texts. The correspondences between Merkabah mysticism and Gnosticism may be illustrated from two works. The first is The Hypostasis of the Archons (NHC 2/4).43 The second section of this treatise follows a pattern found commonly in apocalyptic works (and also in 3En): that of a revelation of secrets by an angel. Eleleth, Sagacity, the Great Angel who stands in the presence of the Holy Spirit, comes down from heaven to instruct Norea about the origin of the archons. Chapter 94, 8-13 (Labib 142, 8-13) refers to a \"veil\" (katapetasma) that divides \"the World Above and the realms that are below.\" Chapter 95, 19-22 (Labib 143, 19-22) makes it clear that this veil separates the seventh and eighth heavens. A parallel passage in the Untitled Work (NHC 2/5) refers to a \"veil\" (parapetasma) that separates man from the celestials (98, 22; Labib 146, 22). The Merkabah texts also mention heavenly veils: according to one tradition the first heaven, Wilon, is a veil, and we read of a curtain (pargod/ pardket) that hangs before the throne of God (see 3En 17:3; 45:1). At 94, 25-26 (Labib 142, 25-26) we read that the first archon who came into existence was \"Samael (which is, 'god of the blind').\" Samma'el is the Prince of the Accusers in 3 Enoch 14:2 and 26:12. The Semitic etymology in the gnostic text is noteworthy: Samael is derived from the Hebrew/ Aramaic root sm\\ \"to be blind,\" and *el, \"God.\"44 41 It appears that a number of glosses have been incorporated into the text of Ezek 1. These may be evidence of very early interest in Ma'aseh Merkabah in its own right: see W. Zimmerli, Ezechiel (Biblischer Kommentar Altes Testament 13/1; 1969) esp. pp. 23-30. 42 On the Jewish element in Gnosticism see G. W. MacRae, \"The Jewish Background of the Gnostic Sophia Myth,\" NovT 12 (1970) 86-101; J. Quispel, Gnostic Studies (Istanbul, 1974) vol. 1, pp. 173-239; R. McL.

Layton's translation has been quoted. 44 Bullard offers the alternative translation \" 'Samael/ that is, the blind god.\""},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"When Samael blasphemously proclaims to his seven offspring, \"It is I who am the god of the Entirety,\" he is rebuked by Life (Zoe), the daughter of Faith-Wisdom (Pistis-Sophia). Then \"she breathed into his face, and her breath became a fiery angel for her; and that angel bound Yaldabaoth (i.e. Samael) and cast him down into Tartaros below the Abyss\" (95, 8-13; Labib 143, 8-13). It is perhaps not inappropriate to compare with this the Merkabah idea that the angels are created by the utterance (dibbur) of God (see 3En 40:4; cf. 27:3). When Sabaoth, one of Yaldabaoth's offspring, sees the punishment meted out to his father, he repents, condemns his father and his mother, Matter, and praises Wisdom (Sophia) and Life (Zoe). Wisdom and Life thereupon take him up and give him charge over the seventh heaven. Sabaoth makes for himself \"a great four-faced chariot [harma] of cherubim [cher-oubin] and infinitely many angels to act as ministers, and also harps and lyres. And Wisdom took her daughter Life, and had her sit upon his right to teach him the things that exist in the Eighth (Heaven)\" (95, 13-34; Labib 143, 13-34). This description of the elevation of Sabaoth is rather reminiscent of the account of the elevation of Enoch in 3 Enoch 4-15. Compare, for example, the instruction of Sabaoth with 3 Enoch 10:5, where we read that God committed the Prince of Wisdom and the Prince of Understanding to Enoch \"to teach him the wisdom of those above and of those below, the wisdom of this world and of the world to come.\" Sabaoth's chariot naturally recalls Ezekiel's Merkabah: for the expression, \"a chariot of cherubim,\" compare 3 Enoch 24:1 and 22:11. The allusion in the gnostic text to choirs of angels is also easily paralleled in the Merkabah texts; see 3 Enoch 35-40.45 The second text which we shall compare with Merkabah mysticism is Origen's summary of the teachings of the gnostic \"sect of the Ophians\" in the Contra Celsum 6:24—38.46 Origen's account is garbled but a number of points are reasonably clear. An important part of the Ophian teaching was concerned with the ascent of the soul to heaven after death (6:27). To reach its goal in the realm of the Father and the Son the soul had to pass through a \"Barrier of Evil,\" which is defined as \"the gates of the archons which are shut for ever\" (6:31). There are seven archons controlling the gates; in ascending order they are: Horaeus, Aiolaeus, Astaphaeus, (Adonaeus), Sabaoth, Iao, and Ialdabaoth.47 To persuade the archons to let him pass, the soul must address them by name, recite the correct formula, and show to each of them a \"symbol\" (symbolon). These symbols are perhaps to be connected with the \"seal\" (sphragis) which, according to 6:27, was bestowed by the Father on the \"Youth and Son.\" Seals are certainly mentioned in the context of passage through the aeons in the Naassene hymn quoted by Hippolytus, Refutation of All Heresies 5.10.2. Having passed through the realms of the seven archons the soul reaches the eighth sphere—the Ogdoad (6:31), which is ruled over by a nameless being hailed as \"first power.\" The soul would appear to have effectively reached its goal since the Ogdoad seems to lie within the realrfl of the Father and the Son: \"From here on,\" announces the ascending soul, \"I am sent forth pure, being already part of the light of the Son and the Father\" (6:31). The Ogdoad, or eighth heaven, is mentioned elsewhere in the gnostic texts; see, for example, The Hypostasis of the Archons 95, 34 (Labib 143, 34). This whole passage should be compared with the ascent to the Merkabah described in Hekalot Rabbati 17:1-20:3 (BHM, vol. 3, pp. 95-98). According to this text the adept on his ascent to the Merkabah must pass through seven doors (the doors of the heavenly palaces), each of them controlled by powerful angels (cf. 3En 18:3). To pass through the doors the adept must know the names of the doorkeepers, and he must show them the appropriate seals (cf. 3En 48D:5). The concept of the eighth heaven can also be matched in the Merkabah texts. Ogdoad is sometimes found in the gnostic texts as a name of the supreme power; Scholem has argued that its analogue in the Merkabah texts may be the divine name 'Azbogah, which is made up of three sets of consonants each of which adds up by gematria to eight 45 The account of the elevation of Sabaoth in the Untitled Work (NHC 2/5) provides some further points of comparison with the Merkabah texts (see 103, 32-106, 18; Labib 151, 32-154, 18). See Gruenwald, Proceedings of the Sixth World Congress of Jewish Studies, vol. 3, pp. 45f. 46 Edited by P. Koetschau in GCS; translated by H. Chadwick, Origen: Contra Celsum (Cambridge, 1953); also in W. Foerster, Gnosis: A Selection of Gnostic Texts (Oxford, 1972) vol. 1, pp. 94-99. 47 Origen curiously lists them in descending order. \"Adonaeus\" has accidentally dropped out of the text; see 6:32. It is to be supplied between Astaphaeus and Sabaoth following the suggestion of Bouhereau (see Koetschau's apparatus criticus); cf. Chadwick, Origen: Contra Celsum, p. 348, n. 1."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"(Gnosticism, pp. 65-71; cf. 3En 18:22). The name of the archon of the fourth aeon in the gnostic text is noteworthy; as Origen recognized, Iao is probably derived from a form of the tetragram YHWH. In the gnostic works Pistis Sophia and the Book ofJeu we encounter the \"Great Iao\" and the \"Little Iao\" (Pistis Sophia, chs. 7 [twice], 86, 140; Book ofJeu, ch. 50). These may correspond to the titles \"greater YHWH\" and \"lesser YHWH\" found in the Merkabah texts (3En 48B:1[44]; 48D:1[90]) (cf. Odeberg, 3 Enoch, pt. 1, app. 2, pp. 188-92).48 It is far from clear how we are to explain these parallels between Merkabah mysticism and Gnosticism. Has Merkabah mysticism in its early stages influenced Gnosticism? Or have both systems drawn on a common ancestral tradition, such as Palestinian apocalyptic? Or has some third party, such as syncretistic magic, mediated between them and transferred ideas from one tradition to the other? In the present state of our knowledge it is impossible to say. We must be careful not to read too much into these parallels. There are important theological differences between Merkabah mysticism and Gnosticism which should not be ignored. In Gnosticism there is normally a sharp conflict between the good supreme power and the evil demiurge; there is no such opposition between God in his transcendence and God as he reveals himself on the throne of glory in the Merkabah texts. We should also note that in Gnosticism the ascent to heaven is made after death whereas in Merkabah mysticism it is made during life and can be repeated many times over. It must also be recognized that parallels to Merkabah mysticism can be found not only in Gnosticism but also in the Hermetic writings, the Chaldean Oracles, the magical papyri (such as the so-called \"Great Magical Papyrus of Paris\"),49 and more remotely in Roman Mithraism and Neoplatonism. Even the paganism of late antiquity was closer to Merkabah ideas than we might at first suppose, for, as E. R. Dodds points out, there were many pious pagans who, by the second century A.D., had come to regard the gods of classical Greek mythology as \"no more than mediating daemons, satraps of an invisible, supramundane King.\"50 When we consider Merkabah mysticism in the light of these non-Jewish religious world views of late antiquity we can see how completely it fits into the religious climate of its time. It is not a purely Jewish religious phenomenon, but has been shaped by forces generally at work in the political and social history of late antiquity. Identifying those forces is an extremely delicate task. E. R. Dodds suggested that the disturbed social, political, and economic conditions in the period from Marcus Aurelius to Constantine had a profound effect on the development of several of the religious world views to which we may compare Merkabah mysticism. He quotes with approval a dictum of Festugiere: * 'Misery and mysticism are related facts.\"51 To some degree Dodds may be right. It is interesting to note that the Merkabah texts themselves make the point that Merkabah mysticism was a source of comfort and reassurance in times of crisis and stress (Hekalot Rabbati 4:4-5, BHM, vol. 3, pp. 86f.; cf. BM, vol. 1, pp. 74f.; and Hekalot Rabbati 13, BHM, vol. 3, p. 93). But a simple correlation of misery and mysticism cannot represent the whole story; we must also account for the fact that Merkabah mysticism continued to flourish and develop not only in Palestine but also in Babylonia right down to the eighth or ninth century A.D. If we focus our attention on the phenomenon of trance, which appears to have played a significant role in Merkabah mysticism, we may perhaps gain a deeper understanding of the sociological function of Maca£eh Merkabah. It is true that there is a significantly high incidence of trance phenomena in very poor societies, but here we must note a crucial difference. When trance correlates with poverty as a catharsis, it is usually a public business: for it to be effective large numbers must go into trance or participate closely in the trances of those who do. The Merkabah mystics, on the other hand, were apparently few in number, 48 Scholem (Gnosticism, pp. 37f.) has suggested that there are close parallels between the Merkabah doctrine of Si'ur Qomah and the gnostic thinker Marcus' description of the \"Body of Truth\"; see Irenaeus, Adversus Haereses 1.14.3 = Epiphanius, Panarion 34.5 (Foerster, Gnosis, vol. 1, p. 205). 49 See M. Smith, \"Observations on Hekhalot Rabbati\" in Biblical and Other Studies, ed. A. Altmann (Cambridge, Mass., 1963) pp. 142-60. 50 Dodds, Pagan and Christian, p. 38; see also p. 57. Further, M. P.

Trance outside this setting was presumably regarded as demon possession. The fact that the Merkabah trances were confined to a small elite within society suggests that their modern analogue would be stiamanistic trance. In shamanistic societies trance is confined to a few and it serves two purposes: First, it marks off the trance-subjects as special and distinctive within the group; and, second, it is an integral part of the role which these people play toward society. Merkabah trances may have had a similar function within rabbinic society. They bolstered the authority of the adepts, who were rabbis, and they marked them off as holy men, like the holy men of the surrounding religions. Knowledge of the Merkabah mysteries had great prestige value: It is described as \"a great matter,\" greater than a mastery of the intricacies of halakah (see b.Sukk 28a; MidraS MiSle 10, ed. Buber, 34a). But trance phenomena were also closely related to the rabbis' role in society. The rabbi was no mere academic: He was a holy man who through his knowledge and his power could protect society from demonic attack; he had a mediatorial role between God and man; he prayed for rain in times of drought, and, because of his holiness, had an especially close relationship to God. The ability to ascend to heaven and to reach God's throne would have been regarded as facilitating his work. It may, then, have been the continuing importance of the rabbi in the Jewish community that kept Merkabah mysticism alive for so long.52 Theological importance COSMOLOGY Though cosmology is strictly a motif of Maca£eh Bere'Sit, a certain number of cosmological motifs are to be found in the Maca$eh Merkabah texts. One function of this cosmological element in Maca£eh Merkabah appears to be to provide a definite location in the universe for God's throne and to bring it into spatial relationship to man on earth. According to 3 Enoch 17:1-3 and 18:1—2 there are seven heavens above the earth. This tradition of seven heavens is almost universal in classic rabbinic literature (e.g. b.Hag 12b; cf. PRE 19), in the Merkabah texts (e.g. Masseket Hekalot 4, BHM, vol. 2, p. 42; Re>uyot Yehezqe'l, BM, vol. 2, p. 130; ed. Gruenwald, p. 115), and in texts of the Ma'aSeh Bere'Sit tradition (e.g. MidraS Konen, BHM, vol. 2, p. 53; cf. Seder Rabbah diBere'Sit, BM, vol. 1, p. 29; Baraita' diMa'aSeh Bere'Sit, ed. SSd, A 72-123, 296-369; B 60-112, 263-304). However, other views are occasionally found. Thus Hagigah 12b records an opinion that there are only two heavens, while MidraS Tehillim 114:2 (ed. Buber, 236a) states that some held that there are three. Within the Merkabah tradition itself speculation arose as to the possibility of heavens beyond the seventh. An eighth was postulated on the basis of the reference in Ezekiel 1:22 to a firmament above the heads of the creatures (b.Hag 13a).53 Most extreme was the view that there are 955 heavens above the seventh (3En 48A:1; Masseket Hekalot 7, BHM, vol. 2, p. 45). In 3 Enoch 18 the heavens are merely enumerated (\"first heaven,\" \"second heaven,\" etc.); in chapter 17, however, they each carry a special name (cArabot, Macon, etc.) (cf. 3En 38:1). These names are found in other texts, though there is some difference of opioion as to which name goes with which heaven (see b.Hag L2b; LevR 29:11; ARN A 37, ed. Schechter 55b; Re'uyot Yehezqe'l, BM, vol. 2, pp. 131-33; ed. Gruenwald, pp. 121-37; Yannai, Qerobot leSeper Bere'sit 5/8,112-14, ed. Zulay, p. 15). 3 Enoch 17 agrees precisely with the list in Hagigah 12b, which is attributed there to the third-century Palestinian authority Resh Laqish.54 The first heaven is called Wilon, the \"Veil.\" It separates the lower and the upper worlds, and its opening and shutting may have been regarded as causing the alternation of light and darkness.55 52 On the role of the rabbi see J. Neusner, \"The Phenomenon of the Rabbi in Late Antiquity.\" Numen 16 (1969) 1-20. 53 For a possible connection between the 8th heaven in the Merkabah texts and the gnostic Ogdoad see above on \"Historical importance.\" 54 See Gruenwald, Tarbis 36 (1966/67) 269f. 55 See 3En 17:3, n. f."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"Further cosmological material is to be found in 3 Enoch as follows: (1) 17:4-7, a short astronomical passage in which the heavenly bodies are described as inert masses moved through the heavens by angels; (2) 14:3-4, a list of angels who control the elemental forces of the world (fire, rain, thunder, etc.); (3) 41:1-3, speculation on the letters by which the world was created; (4) 42:1-7, speculation on the power of divine names to hold in balance opposed elemental forces such as cold and heat. THE HEAVENLY WORLD In the seventh heaven stands God's abode—a series of seven palaces (hekalot) arranged concentrically (3En 18:3; cf. 1:1-2; 7; 37:1; Hekalot Rabbati 15-16, BHM, vol. 3, p. 94; Masseket Hekalot 4, BHM, vol. 2, p. 42). The word for palace, hekdl (pi. hekalot), denotes both \"palace\" and \"temple\" and so has overtones both of royalty and of holiness. The motif of the seven hekalot is peculiar to the Merkabah tradition, though it is not found in all the Merkabah texts; thus it is notably absent from the early work Re'uyot Yehezqe'l. It does not appear overtly in Hagigah llb-16a, though, as we noted above, there may be an allusion to it in Aqiba's reference to \"the stones of pure marble\" (14a). Analogous ideas to the seven hekalot occur in a number of places: Seper HaRazim speaks of seven heavenly dwellings (me'dndt) (Petihah 6, ed. Margalioth, p. 65; 7:19, 25, ed. Margalioth, p. 108; cf. 3En 17:3), and Hagigah 13a of God's \"inner houses\" and \"outer houses\"; the description of God's heavenly abode in lEn 14:10-17 (cf. lEn 71:5-9) as a house within a house is strongly reminiscent of the language used in Merkabah literature to describe the seven palaces. The seven palaces is essentially an idea of Maca$eh Merkabah, that of the seven heavens probably arose from cosmological speculation; 3En 18, which combines the two ideas by locating the seven palaces in the seventh heaven, probably marks the confluence of two originally independent streams of tradition. The centerpiece of the heavenly world is the Merkabah, which stands in the innermost of the seven palaces and bears the throne of glory (kisse* hakkabdd). The physical aspects of the Merkabah are not clearly visualized (though see 3En 25:5 and cf. 22:12 and 48C:4). The topography of heaven is in general sketched very impressionistically (see 3En 37) and the aim appears to be simply to create an atmosphere of awesome majesty. The whole enormous structure of the Merkabah is defined in terms of angelic hierarchies. There is a tendency to spiritualize its physical elements: Thus the 'opannim, \"wheels,\" and the hasmal (JB, \"bronze\") of Ezekiel 1 become orders of angels in 3 Enoch (see e.g. ch. 7). A curtain (pargdd) hangs before God's throne separating his immediate presence from the rest of the heavenly world. This curtain shields the angels from the full glare of the divine glory. It also symbolizes the ultimate inscrutability of God and of the mysteries known only to him. In 3 Enoch 45 Metatron shows Ishmael the whole course of human history, from Adam to the messianic age, embroidered on the curtain.56 Following Daniel 7:10 the Merkabah texts speak of a River of Fire that flows out from beneath the throne of glory (3En 36:1). Occasionally more than one River of Fire is mentioned (3En 19:4; 33:4; 37:1). The River of Fire functions in a number of contexts: It is used in accounts of the divine judgment as a symbol of the wrath of God (18:19, 21; 33:4-5); it also forms part of the descriptions of the celestial Sanctus: The angels bathe in the River of Fire before they perform the QeduSSah (36:2).57 A development of this motif is the speculation on the bridges that span the River of Fire (22B:1, with n. b; 22C:1). In the celestial palaces are many treasuries and storehouses. Some of these contain natural phenomena such as snow (22B:3, 4) and lightning (37:2). In others are \"spiritual gifts\" such as wisdom, peace, and \"the fear of heaven\" (48D:2, varia lectio; cf. 1:11; 8:1). There are also the archives (27:1), where the records of the heavenly law court are kept, and in 43:3 there is a reference to a storehouse of beings. 56 See 3En 45:1, n. a.

The divine attributes most persistently stressed, God's holiness and his glory, are conceived of as attributes of transcendence, expressing his \"otherness.\" God's tran­scendence is stated in three main ways. First, God is said to be spatially remote from man. This idea is implicit in the cosmology: God dwells in the seventh palace in the seventh heaven. It is a standard theme of the Merkabah texts that the distances between the different heavens are almost inconceivably vast; see Hagigah 13a; Masseket Hekalot 4 (BHM, vol. 2, p. 43); Re'uyot Yehezqe'l (BM, vol. 2, p. 131; ed. Gruenwald, p. 121). There are elements of this motif of the dimensions of the heavens in 3 Enoch 22C. Second, God is represented as being well-nigh inaccessible to man. His throne stands in the innermost of the seven concentric palaces and the way to it is barred by fierce guardian angels at the gate of each palace. Not only the gatekeepers but the angels in general are opposed to man (3En 1:6—7; 2:2; 5:10; 6:2; 15B:2). The hostile angels form a protective circle round God's throne; in a sense they are hypostatizations of his holiness.58 Third, God's transcendence is expressed through the story in 3 Enoch 5:10-14 of the withdrawal of his Sekinah from the earth. The Sekinah is the divine presence which takes up its abode in a place or with a person or group of people. Where God is experienced as present, there his Sekinah is said to dwell. 3 Enoch pictures the Sekinah in very concrete terms: It is a bright light, a luminous cloud, like the cloud that manifested God's presence in the Temple and the Tabernacle (IKgs 8:10; Lev 16:2; cf. NumR 12:4; SongR 3:8). According to 3 Enoch 5:1-14, after Adam was expelled from Eden, the Sekinah remained on earth, but since the generation of Enosh (the third in line from Adam) it has been residing in the highest heaven.59 The Merkabah mystics were greatly exercised by the problem of who (or what) occupies the throne of glory, and how he (or it) should be represented. According to 3 Enoch it is the Sekinah that dwells on the throne (see e.g. 18:19, 24; 22:13, 16; 24:15; 28:2; 37:1; 39:1). However, we gather this fact only in passing, for 3 Enoch shrinks from dwelling on the appearance on the throne. This reticence contrasts sharply with the detailed descriptions which it offers of the higher orders of angels, and it rather sets 3 Enoch off from the Sicur Qomah strand of the mystical tradition. In Sicur Qomah a form is given to the divine glory: It is envisaged as a colossal human figure and the dimensions of its limbs are computed. Of this speculation there is hardly a trace in 3 Enoch.60 The Merkabah texts represent God and his angels under the image of an emperor and his court. God has his heavenly palace, his throne, and, in Metatron, his grand vizier; he has also his treasuries and storehouses. The image of God as the heavenly king is by no means an innovation of the Merkabah texts, but it is possible that the heavenly court of 3 Enoch reflects something of the earthly courts of its time. Noteworthy is the designation of the angelic hosts as \"the heavenly household\" (pamalya* selenufalah: 3En 18:21; cf. 12:5; 16:1). This would appear to be an allusion to the familia Caesaris, the body of imperial slaves and 58 On angelic opposition to man see A.

The organization of the heavenly world in the Merkabah texts may reflect the image of an absolute monarchy with a complex bureaucracy; the emperor was only to be approached through intermediaries or with elaborate protocols. Perhaps this picture corresponds best to the image cast by the monarchy in the Byzantine era.61 THE HEAVENLY HOUSEHOLD Although the angels play a central role in Merkabah mysticism, there is no uniform angelology in the Merkabah texts. Even within 3 Enoch itself we find three different angelologies incorporated more or less intact (ch. 17; ch. 18; chs. 19-22 and 25:1-28:6), and fragments of several other systems as well. 3 Enoch agrees with the standard rabbinic view that angels are of a fiery substance (chs. 7 and 15). The higher angels at least have human form: They are pictured as huge warriors armed with swords and bows; see 3 Enoch 22 and the vivid descriptions in Masseket Hekalot 4 (BHM, vol. 2, p. 42) and Hekalot Rabbati 15:8-16:2 (BHM, vol. 3, pp. 74f.) and 20:3 (p. 98); compare Seper HaRazim 2:14-16 (ed. Margalioth, p. 82) and 2:131-33 (ed, Margalioth, p. 88). In 3 Enoch 47:2f. the analogy with humankind is taken to the extent of seeing angels as composed both of \"body\" and \"soul.\" The countless myriads of angels are grouped into classes and the classes ordered into hierarchies. The angelology of 3 Enoch 19-22, 25:1-28:6 has the following grades (in ascending order of rank): common angels (meSdretim, maPdkim, etc.), galgallim, creatures (hayyot), cherubim, ophanim, seraphim, Watchers and holy ones (Hrin and qaddiSin). Other angelic classes are mentioned elsewhere: haSmallim and Sin'anim (ch. 7); 'elirn, 'efellim, and tapsarim (14:1); and 'elohim (15B:1, n. c).62 Merkabah mysticism is greatly interested in the names of the angels. This interest was partly theurgical: To know the angels' names was to have the power to invoke them (see e.g. Hekalot Rabbati 14:4, BHM, vol. 3, p. 94). Merkabah texts are replete with angelic names. These are of various kinds: (1) Some, such as Michael and Gabriel, are biblical and traditional. Others are formed on the analogy of these and consist of a stem element and 'el, \"God.\" In many cases the stem contains an allusion to the function of the angel who bears the name; Baraqi'el is the angel of lightning, bdrdq (3En 14:4). In other cases, however, the stem does not appear to have any meaning. Some names are compounded with yah, \"Lord,\" e.g. Suryah. (2) Another group comprises names constructed by using techniques of letter and number magic such as gematria, temurah, and notarikon. A case in point is 'Azbogah (3En 18:22). This name is made up of three pairs of consonants, each of which adds up by gematria to eight. (3) Some of the names may be corruptions of foreign words, particularly Greek. (4) Some may have originated as glossolalia. There are a number of important angelic offices mentioned in the Merkabah texts. Different angels fill these offices in different traditions, but the offices themselves remain constant. 1. Prince of the Divine Presence (Sar happdnim): an angel who has the privilege of serving in God's immediate presence; see 3 Enoch 8:1; 48C:7; Hekalot Rabbati 11:1 (BHM, vol. 3, p. 91). It is possible that the idea of the Prince of the Divine Presence may be connected with that of the curtain: note Masseket Hekalot 7 (BHM, vol. 2, p. 46). 3 Enoch frequently calls Metatron Prince of the Divine Presence, but others, such as Suryah in Hekalot Rabbati 14:4 (BHM, vol. 3, p. 94), also bear the title. It is probable that the title is derived from Isaiah 63:9: \"In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence [maPakpdndyw] saved them\"; cf. Tobit 12:15; Jubilees 1:27; Hekalot Rabbati 3:3 (BHM, vol. 3, p. 85); Cairo Genizah Hekalot B/l, 36 (ed. Gruenwald, p. 369). Note also 61 However, it should be borne in mind that it is very hard, first, to establish how the Byzantine ideology of kingship worked itself out in practice, and, second, to discover what image the monarchy would have cast in the minds of its subjects. As a Christian example of the correlation of the emperor and his court with God and his angels we may take the Byzantine mosaic from the Church of the Assumption, Nicaea, Turkey, which shows the archangels in the garb of court officials carrying military standards inscribed with the Sanctus; see further Louis R£au, Iconographie de Van chritien, vol. 2.1 (Paris, 1965) p. 35. 62 Maimonides, Yad. Yesode Torah 2:7, lists ten orders of angels. In ascending order of rank they are: bayyot, ophanim, 'er'ellim, basmallim, seraphim, mal'akim, 'elohim, bene 'elohim, cherubim, 'iSim. The Zohar, Masseket 'Asilut, and Berit Menubah all have different systems, but the number ten remains constant. Christian writers, following Dionysius the Areopagite's Celestial Hierarchies, usually have nine orders; see Dante, Paradiso, Canto 28."},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"Esther 1:14, which refers to the seven princes (sdrim) of Persia and Media \"who saw the king's face.\" 2. Prince of Torah (Sar Tdrdh): an angel who can help one to understand Torah (particularly its deeper, mystical aspects), and can prevent one from forgetting what one has learned (Hekalot Rabbati 30:2, BHM, vol. 3, p. 107; Ma'aSeh Merkabah 13, ed. Scholem, p. 109). In 3 Enoch 48D:4 the Prince of Torah is called Yepipyah. He is shown there in a typical role, assisting Moses to remember the Law he received on Sinai. Variations on the title Prince of Torah are \"Prince of Learning\" (Sar Talmud) (Cairo Genizah Hekalot B/l, 20, ed. Gruenwald, p. 369) and \"Prince of Wisdom\" (Sar hokmah) (3En 10:5; 48D:1[93]). Cairo Genizah Hekalot B/l, 37 (ed. Gruenwald, p. 369) speaks of \"Princes of Torah\" (Sare Tdrdh). 3. Princes of kingdoms (Sare malkuyyot). Developing the thought of Daniel 10:20-21, 3 Enoch assigns to each nation on earth its angelic representative in heaven (cf. lEn 89:59), who speaks on its behalf in the heavenly law court (3En 30; cf. 17:8). The only princes of kingdoms to emerge in 3 Enoch as individuals are Samma'el, the Prince of Rome, DubbPel, the Prince of Persia (26:12), and Michael, the Prince of Israel (44:10). 4. Prince of the World (Sar hdcdldm): an angel, distinct from the princes of kingdoms, who is in charge of the world as a whole. He is mentioned in rabbinic texts, but is a rather nebulous figure (b.Yeb 16b; b.Hull 60a; b.Sanh 94a; ExR 17:4). 3 Enoch 30:2 states that he has authority over the princes of kingdoms and he pleads for the world at the heavenly assize. In 3 Enoch 38:3 he appears to be the ruler of the heavenly bodies. He is not clearly identified in 3 Enoch. Metatron fulfills some of his functions (3:2; 10:3), and in later texts is equated with him explicitly (Tosapot to Yeb 16b and to Hull 60a). Some circles regarded Michael as the Prince of the World (PRE 27; cf. Yalqut Sim'oni Gen 132). The Prince of the World in the Merkabah texts is not an evil figure as in John 12:31 and 16:11. 5. The guardians of the doors (Sdmere happetahim): angels who guard the gates of the seven palaces. Hekalot Rabbati 22:1 (BHM, vol. 3, p. 99) states that there are eight at each gate, and each group has its leader. In 3 Enoch 18:3, in contrast to Hekalot Rabbati, the gatekeepers are not given names; 3 Enoch 1:3, however, alludes to the chief of the gatekeepers of the seventh palace, Prince Qaspi'el. Cairo Genizah Hekalot A/1, 35 (ed. Gruenwald, p. 359) refers to \"guardians of the palaces\" (Sdmere hekalot), which is presumably a variant of \"guardians of the doors.\" By far the most significant angel in 3 Enoch is Metatron. Metatron's position in the heavenly world is briefly and accurately summed up in the title \"The lesser YHWH\" (3En 12:5; 48C:7; 48D:1[90]); he is the highest of the archangels and God's vice-regent (3En 10:3-6). Like the Holy One himself, he has a throne and presides over a celestial law court (3En 16:1). There has been a great deal of speculation about the meaning of the name Metatron. The name actually occurs in two forms, Mttrwn and Myttrwn. Various etymologies for it have been suggested. The more plausible are as follows: (1) Latin metator: This word originally designated the officer who went ahead of the army to prepare its camp, but it was then used generally of anyone who prepares the way. In favor of this explanation is the fact that metator is clearly attested as a loanword in Hebrew and Jewish Aramaic.63 (2) Greek metaturannos = \"the one next to the ruler,\" i.e. next to God, or, assuming this is equivalent to sunthronos, \"the one enthroned with (God).\" (3) Greek (ho) meta thronon = \"(the throne) next to the (divine) throne,\" \"the second throne.\" None of the etymologies suggested is really satis­factory. It should be remembered that an angelic name such as Metatron does not necessarily have an etymology; it could be gibberish, like the magical names cAdiriron and Dapdapiron. Metatron in 3 Enoch is a complex figure with a long history behind him. It is possible to trace some of the stages of his development. Metatron is, in a number of respects, similar to the archangel Michael: Both angels were known as \"the Great Prince\"; both were said to serve in the heavenly sanctuary; both were guardian angels of Israel; what is said in one text about Michael is said in another about Metatron.64 A possible explanation of these 63 See n. 11 above. On the uses of metator in Lat. and Gk. see Milik, The Books of Enoch, pp. 131-33. 64 See Ginzberg, Legends, vol. 5, p. 20, n. 91; p. 170, n. 10; p. 305, n. 248; vol. 6 (1928), p. 74, n. 381; Lieberman, Shkiin, pp. 11-15, 99f.; Alexander, JJS 28 (1977) 162f."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"similarities would be that originally Metatron and Michael were one and the same angel: Michael was the angel's common name, Metatron one of his esoteric, magical names.63 At some point, however, the connection between Metatron and Michael was obscured, and a new, independent archangel with many of Michael's powers came into being. The connection may not have been entirely lost, for we find that in some late texts the identity of the two angels is asserted: see e.g. Seper Zerubbabel, BM, vol. 2, p. 498 (the text in BHM, vol. 2, p. 55, is slightly different). Metatron was merged with two other heavenly figures, (1) the archangel Yaho'el, and (2) translated Enoch. Metatron bears the name Yaho'el in 3 Enoch 48D:1(1). From other texts, however, we know of an angel Yaho'el quite independent of Metatron (Seper HaRazim 2:38, ed. Margalioth, p. 83; 2:140, ed. Margalioth, p. 89; Maca$eh Merkabah 20, ed. Scholem, p. 111,1. 29; Slavonic LAE 32:If.; ApMos 43:4; and especially Slavonic ApAb 10). The archangel Yaho'el probably originated in speculation about the angel in whom God's name resides, according to Exodus 23:20f. (note in this connection ApAb 10). In 3 Enoch 12:5 and Sanhedrin 38b the angel of Exodus 23:20 is identified as Metatron. The title \"lesser YHWH\" (3En 12:5) may have belonged originally to Yaho'el; it certainly seems to be attested independently of Metatron in gnostic texts. Metatron's absorption of translated Enoch could only have taken place in circles acquainted with the Palestinian apocalyptic Enoch traditions. The apocalyptic texts do not seem to go so far as to say that Enoch was transformed into an archangel when he was translated into heaven, but some of them speak of his exaltation in language which could be taken to imply this (see esp. 2En 22:8). There were evidently mystics who laid great store by Metatron. It is not hard to see why he attracted them. He was a human being who had been elevated over all the angels, and was living proof that man could overcome angelic opposition and approach God. He was a powerful \"friend at court.\" The transformation of Enoch in 3 Enoch 15 may reflect something of the experiences of the mystics themselves as they ascended to behold the Merkabah. Others, of more orthodox leanings, were not enamored of Metatron and considered that the powers ascribed to him bordered on dualism (b.Sanh 38b; b.Hag 15a). There are traces of criticism of the doctrine of Metatron in 3 Enoch 16 and lO^.66 THE ACTIVITIES OF THE HEAVENLY WORLD The heavenly law court Building on such biblical texts as 1 Kings 22:19-22, Psalm 82; Job 1:6-12, and especially Daniel 7:9f., the rabbis taught that there is a heavenly law court (bet din Selema'aldh or pamalyd' Selenufaldh, in its narrower sense) over which God presides (b.Sanh 38b; ExR 30:18; LevR 24:2). It was regarded as the heavenly counterpart of the earthly Sanhedrin (b.Sanh 99b; b.Ber 16b/17a), and there was earnest discussion as to the relative jurisdictions of the two courts (b.Makk 23b; Pesiqta5 deRab Kahana 5:13, ed. Buber, 48a; cf. DeutR 5:5; GenR 26:6). The heavenly law court is one of the main themes of 3 Enoch, and its sessions are covered in detail. There are three main blocks of material: (1) 28:7-10; 30:1-33:2; (2) 26:12; and (3) 18:19-21. It is characteristic of 3 Enoch that the heavenly assize is not the eschatological last judgment, after the resurrection of the dead (cf. b.Sanh 91b; LevR 4:5), but a judgment that takes place daily (3En 28:7, 9; 26:12; cf. GenR 50:3). According to 3 Enoch 30: If. the court is made up of seventy-two princes of kingdoms and the Prince of the 65 Scholem, Gnosticism, p. 46, suggests that evidence of this is to be found in Re'uyot Yefcezqe'l, BM, vol. 2, p. 132 (ed. Gruenwald, pp. 128f.): \"The Prince dwells nowhere but in Zebul [the 3rd heaven] . . . And what is his name? . . . Mitatron, like the name of the Power.\" He suggests the \"Prince\" here is Michael on the grounds that Michael is called \"the great prince\" in Dan 12:1; cf. b.Hag 12b; b.Men 110a; b.Zeb 62a.

Satan and his two representatives, Samma'el, the Prince of Rome, and DubbPel, the Prince of Persia, appear as the accusers in 26:12. The heavenly academy 3 Enoch 18:15f. contains a passing reference to the rabbinic idea that Torah is studied in heaven in the heavenly academy (yesibdh Selema^alah), just as it is studied in the academies on earth (b.BM 86a; b.Gitt 68a; b.Tacan 21b; cf. b.Ber 64a). The celestial Qedussah 3 Enoch represents the celebration of God's holiness through the recitation of the QeduSSah (the Sanctus) as the central act of heavenly worship. 3 Enoch 35-40 is devoted entirely to this subject. The celestial QeduSSah takes a number of different forms in 3 Enoch: see (1) 22B:8; (2) 1:12; 20:2; (3) 39:1-2; 48B:2. There is a marked absence in 3 Enoch of Merkabah hymns, which are such a striking feature of some Merkabah texts (e.g. Hekalot Rabbati and Maca£eh Merkabah). The only heavenly hymns in 3 Enoch are, like the QeduSSah, traditional and biblical. As we have already noted, the Merkabah hymns had a theurgical use and their total absence from 3 Enoch may point to an anti-theurgical tendency in the final redaction of this work. MAN 3 Enoch is interested in the human soul, its origin, and its fate after death (see esp. 43:1-44:7). Men are divided into three classes—the righteous, the intermediate, and the wicked (cf. b.RH 16b/17a; b.Shab 152b; t.Sanh 13:3). The souls of the righteous ascend to the throne of glory after death and there enjoy God's presence: according to 3 Enoch 43:2 they fly above the throne; in Sanhedrin 152b they are stored in treasuries beneath the throne. The intermediate are purified in the purgatorial fires of Sheol and then, presumably, allowed to join the righteous above. The wicked are consigned to the flames of Gehinnom (3En 44:3). 3 Enoch is silent as to their ultimate fate, and the point was much disputed among the rabbis. Many regarded their punishment as of limited duration; after a brief period they would be annihilated (b.RH 17a; cf. m.cEduy 2:10; b.Shab 33b; LamR 1:40). Some taught, however, that certain types of sinners would be punished eternally (b.RH 17a). 3 Enoch is not explicit as to when the division into classes takes place. Two views are given in Rosh Hashanah 16b/17a: According to the one it takes place at a heavenly assize held on each New Year's Day (cf. m.RH 1:2; t.RH 2:11-13); according to the other it is done at the final day of judgment, when the dead are raised (b.RH 17a, with Tosapot leydm). 3 Enoch has no interest in the last judgment, so it is probable that its view is that the division into classes takes place at the judgment which each man undergoes immediately after death. (For a fanciful description of this \"judgment of the grave\" see Masseket hibbut haqqeber, BHM, vol. 1, pp. 151f.; cf. also BHM, vol. 5, pp. 49-51.) This is the judgment spoken of in 3 Enoch 31:2. According to 3 Enoch the human soul not only survives the body, and, at least in the case of the righteous, goes up to the heavenly regions, but it pre-exists the body as well, and descends from the heavenly storehouse of souls to enter the body at birth (3En 43:3; cf. b.Yeb 62a and parallels: 63b, b.AZ 5a; b.Nidd 13b; GenR 24:4; LevR 15:1; further b.Hag 12b). Unborn souls have done no wrong and so may be classified loosely as \"righteous\" (3En 43:1). Some rabbis went so far as to hold that the soul was intrinsically pure (see b.Ber 10a; LevR 4:8; Tanhuma5, ed. Buber, vol. 3 [Wayyiqrd*], 4a/b). The stress in 3 Enoch is on the idea of immortality; typically there is no reference to the eschatological notion of the resurrection of the dead. Relation to the canonical books OLD TESTAMENT The mystics were steeped in the Bible and their picture of the heavenly world was formed by harmonizing the Old Testament references to (1) theophanies, (2) angels, and (3) ascensions to heaven."},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"1. Theophanies: The visions of the Merkabah in Ezekiel 1; 3:12-15, 22-24; 8:1-4; 10:1-22; and 43:1-7 were their basic texts. These provided them with such fundamental elements as the Merkabah (3En 1:1, 5-7); the wheels (ophanim; 3En 25); the four creatures (hayyot; 3En 20f.); the throne of glory (3En 1:10,12); the hasmal (3En 36:2,7); the cherubim (3En 22). Daniel 7:9-10 and Isaiah 6 were incorporated into Ezekiel's picture. Daniel 7 records a vision of God seated on a fiery throne which has wheels of flame. It furnishes the additional motifs of the heavenly law court (3En 28:7), the River of Fire (3En 18:19-21; 19:4; 33:4; 36:1-2; 37:1), and the hosts of attendant angels (cf. 3En 19:6). Isaiah 6 contains a vision of God seated on a high and exalted throne (cf. 3En 26:12). Isaiah 6 contributes to the total picture the seraphim (3En 26) and the QeduSSah (3En 1:12; 20:2). Note also the vision of heaven in 1 Kings 22:19-22, in which the Lord is seen seated on his throne with all the array of heaven standing before him. Ezekiel employs the language of the nature theophanies (\"fire, lightning, storm\") to express the appearance of God's glory. The Merkabah texts expand this imagery by drawing on other Old Testament accounts of nature theophanies, particularly God's appearance to Israel at Sinai (Ex 19:16-18; cf. IKgs 19:11-13; Pss 18:7-15 and 97:2-5). For combinations of these elements see 3 Enoch 34 and 37. 2. Angels: Such Old Testament phrases as \"the host of heaven\" (IKgs 22:19) and \"the host of the height\" (Isa 24:31) suggest that the number of the angels is virtually infinite (cf. 3En 19:6). The Old Testament appplies various names to the angels: seraphim (Isa 6:2, 6); cherubim (Ezek 10); creatures (hayyot) (Ezek 1); Watchers and holy ones (Hrin and qaddisin) (Dan 4:14). 3 Enoch takes these names as designations of different orders of angels (3En 19-22; 25-28:6). The angels are represented in Genesis 19: If. and Daniel 8:15f. as having human form, and in Joshua 5:13; Numbers 22:23; and 1 Chronicles 21:16, 30 as being armed with weapons; cf. 3 Enoch 22:3-9. The powerful \"angel of the Lord\" in the Old Testament (who is sometimes hard to distinguish from God himself) may be the prototype of 3 Enoch's Metatron (cf. Ex 23:20-23 with Judg 2:1-5, and see 3En 12:5 and b.Sanh 38b). 3. Ascensions to Heaven: The most obvious case in the Bible of someone ascending to heaven is Elijah (2Kgs 2:11). Following a very old tradition 3 Enoch states that Enoch also was translated. Genesis 5:24 is ambiguous on this point, but the occurrence there and in 2 Kings 2:9 of the Hebrew verb laqah (\"to take\")67 was used in rabbinic exegesis to show that Enoch departed in the same manner as Elijah. Note how 3 Enoch 6:1 describes Enoch's translation to heaven in the same terms as the Bible uses of Elijah's ascent. THE NEW TESTAMENT In view of the date of its final redaction there can be no possibility of 3 Enoch as a work having directly influenced the New Testament. However, it and the other Merkabah texts throw light on certain aspects of the New Testament. 1. The Colossian \"Heresy\": The ideas of the Merkabah mystics provide some interesting parallels to the Colossian \"heresy.\" The Colossian \"heretics\" stressed the role of angels as mediators between God and man (Col 2:8, 18; cf. Col 1:13-20 and 2:15) and visions played an important part in their religious life (Col 2:18). At the same time they appear to have had a legalistic strand to their teaching: They enjoined the observance of religious festivals, new moons and sabbaths, and the Jewish dietary laws (Col 2:16, 21); they may also have demanded circumcision from converts (cf. Col 2:11). New Testament scholars have described the Colossian \"heresy\" vaguely as \"gnosticizing Judaism,\" or as \"syncre-tistic Judaism,\" or have attempted to link it with Qumran and Essenes. They appear to be agreed that (despite its legalistic side) it cannot be linked with the Pharisaic movement. However, the Merkabah texts make it clear that these ideas can exist side by side with strict Torah-observant Judaism. 2. Paul in Paradise: According to 2 Corinthians 12:1-7 Paul himself experienced ascent to heaven. He describes it as being \"caught up to the third heaven\" and as being \"caught up to paradise.\" The term \"paradise\" here recalls the expression \"to enter Pardes,\" which was used early on in the Merkabah movement to designate the mystical ascent. Like the Merkabah mystics Paul is reluctant to speak of his experiences, though his reticence may 67 On this verb see the references in n. 4."},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"be rather stronger than theirs; the words he heard in heaven were 4 4so secret that human lips may not repeat them\" (2Cor 12:4, NEB). Paul speaks of his ascension as 4'visions and revelations of the Lord\" (2Cor 12:1). The genitive here may be objective: Just as the Merkabah mystics saw God enthroned at the climax of their ecstasy, so Paul may have seen Christ enthroned. However, certain differences between 2 Corinthians 12:1-7 and the Merkabah texts should be noted. Paul's cosmology may allow only for three heavens, as against seven in Merkabah mysticism, while his use of the verb 44to be caught up\" (harpazesthai) suggests involuntary rapture in contrast to the Merkabah mystics' use of trance-inducing techniques. 3. The Book of Revelation: The Book of Revelation is basically an apocalypse (a vision of the end-time) but it does contain material related to Ma'aseh Merkabah. The description of God's throne in Revelation 4 harmonizes elements from Ezekiel 1, Daniel 7, and Isaiah 6, just as the Merkabah texts do. The heavenly hymns in Revelation form, perhaps, the most interesting link with the Merkabah texts. Their repetition of emotive words such as 4 'praise,'' \"honor,\" \"glory,\" \"might,\" \"power,\" and 4'wealth\" are rather reminiscent of some of the Merkabah hymns. See especially Revelation 4:11; 5:12, 13; 7:12; 15:3f. 4. God's \"House\" and \"Family\": The reference in John 14:1 to God's \"house\" with its many \"rooms\" recalls the Merkabah traditions about God's heavenly \"palaces\" and ''dwellings\" with their many \"chambers\" (see 3En 1:1, n. d). Ephesians 3:14 appears to imply that there are \"families\" in heaven as well as on earth. This idea may be illuminated by the Merkabah designation of the angels as \"the celestial family\" {pamalya* selema'aldh), in contrast to God's 4'earthly family\" {pamalyd3 selemattdh), Israel. The Merkabah texts also speak of \"families\" of angels (see 12:5, n. f)-Relation to earlier pseudepigrapha, Dead Sea Scrolls, and Merkabah literature PSEUDEPIGRAPHA The close links between the Merkabah literature and the Pseudepigrapha may be illustrated from five apocalyptic texts: 1 Enoch, 2 Enoch, Testament of Levi, Ascension of Isaiah 6-11, and Apocalypse of Abraham 15-29. The last two of these works (both dating probably from the second century A.D.) in certain respects form a bridge between apocalyptic and the Merkabah texts. J Enoch 1 Enoch has the same kind of complex angelology as we find in Merkabah mysticism; note, for example, the different orders of angels listed in 1 Enoch 61:10-12. 1 Enoch 20 mentions seven archangels: Uriel, Raphael, Raguel, Michael, Saraqael, Gabriel, and Remiel; cf. the angels of the seven heavens in 3 Enoch 17. There is a fair number of angelic names in 1 Enoch; besides the archangels just mentioned, note the list of fallen angels in 1 Enoch 6:7: Kokab'el (4QEna 1 iii, 1. 7), Baraq'el (4QEna 1 iii, 1. 8), ZiqPel (4QEnc 1 ii, 1. 26), etc. (cf. lEn 8:3; 69:2). Angelic names of precisely this type are well attested in the Merkabah texts: ZiqPel occurs in 3 Enoch 14:4; compare further 1 Enoch's Kokab'el and Baraq'el with the slightly different forms in 3 Enoch—KokabPel (3En 14:4; 17:7) and BaraqPel (3En 14:4). There are two Merkabah passages in 1 Enoch, viz. 14:8-25 and 71:5-11; the latter appears to be dependent on the former, which draws on Ezekiel 1 and 10, Isaiah 6, and Daniel 7:9f. Particularly interesting is the reference to the two heavenly houses, one apparently inside the other, with God's throne standing in the inner one. This is probably an anticipation of the idea of the seven concentric heavenly palaces which we find in the Merkabah texts (3En 1:1-2). 1 Enoch's treatment of the final translation of Enoch is also noteworthy (see chs. 70f): Enoch is exalted to the heaven of heavens and by some mysterious process ends up as the Son of Man (lEn 71:14). This may perhaps be compared with the metamorphosis of Enoch into the archangel Metatron in 3 Enoch 3-15. 2 Enoch 2 Enoch is in some ways even closer to 3 Enoch than is 1 Enoch. Its basic scheme is as follows: Under the protection of two heavenly guides Enoch passes through the seven heavens and views the contents of each heaven. He comes to God's throne, is transformed (by being"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"stripped of his earthly garments and anointed with holy oil), and then is brought by the archangel Michael before God's face (2En 22). He is instructed by the archangels Vreveil and Gabriel about various subjects, particularly the workings of nature and the story of creation. The cosmology of the seven heavens found in 2 Enoch is fundamental to the Merkabah texts. The description of the contents of the seven heavens is also a standard Merkabah motif (cf. Re'uyot Yehezqe'l, BM, vol. 2, p. 131; ed. Gruenwald, p. 121; Seper HaRazim; b.Hag 12b). Enoch's ascent through the seven heavens to God's throne, where he receives instruction from the archangels in various mysteries, is parallel to Ishmael's journey in 3 Enoch. The transformation of Enoch in 2 Enoch 22 provides the closest approximation, outside Merkabah literature, to Enoch's transformation in 3 Enoch 3-15. Testament of Levi The Testament of Levi 2:6-5:3 tells of how Levi ascended through the heavens to the \"throne of glory,\" where he received his priestly commissioning from God (5:1-2) and learned mysteries which he was to declare to men (2:10). Levi's heavenly journey was made under the protection of an angelic guide whom he questions about the wonders that he sees (2:8-9). Among the many motifs in this account which can be paralleled in the Merkabah texts, the following are particularly noteworthy: The title of God, \"The Great Glory\" (3:4), is found in its Aramaic equivalent Ziwa3 Rabbd* as a title of Metatron in 3 Enoch 48D:1(88). The designation of God's heavenly throne as the \"throne of glory\" (TLevi 5:1, following the text-witnesses beta, A[efg] and S in Charles's edition) is found very frequently in the Merkabah texts; see e.g. 3 Enoch 1:6. The \"Angels of the Presence of the Lord\" in Testament of Levi 2:5-7 should be compared with the \"Princes of the Divine Presence\" in the Merkabah texts (e.g. 3En 8:1). With the allusion to the heavenly choirs in Testament of Levi 3:8, cf. 3 Enoch 35f. The \"gates of heaven\" in Testament of Levi 5:1 (4QTLevi ara 2:18, trcy smyy) recall the \"gates\" (petdhim I se'drim) of the heavenly palaces (hekalot) in the Merkabah texts (3En 1:2; Hekalot Rabbati 17:1, BHM, vol. 3, p. 95). There is perhaps an allusion to the treasuries of fire, ice, and snow in Testament of Levi 3:2; cf. 3 Enoch 22B: 3, 4; 37:2. The motif of the sea suspended in the first heaven, Testament of Levi 2:7, occurs again in Re'uyot Yebezqe'l (BM, vol. 2, p. 131; ed. Gruenwald, p. 123). Ascension of Isaiah The structure of Ascension of Isaiah 6-11 is very similar to that of 2 Enoch and Testament of Levi 2-5: Isaiah is conducted by a heavenly guide through the seven heavens to God's throne, where he receives the revelation of a mystery. Several details call for comment. In each heaven, except the sixth, Isaiah sees a throne, with angels to its right and to its left, and \"one sitting on the throne\" (see e.g. Ascenls 7:18-20). These thrones may represent the angels in charge of the various heavens (cf. 3En 17), or they may be related to the idea that there is a Merkabah in each heaven (Re'uyot Yehezqe'l, BM, vol. 2, p. 131; ed. Gruenwald, p. 119). In Ascension of Isaiah 7:18-23, 28-31 we find the motif of the dimensions of the heavens, which occurs also in the Merkabah tradition (Re'uyot Yehezqe'l, BM, vol. 2, p. 131; ed. Gruenwald, p. 121; b.Hag 13a). Ascension of Isaiah 10:24-31 mentions angelic guardians of the gates of the various palaces, to whom passwords have to be given. This recalls the Merkabah notion of the gatekeepers of the seven heavenly palaces, to whom \"seals\" have to be shown by the mystic on his way up to heaven (Hekalot Rabbati 17:1-20:3, BHM, vol. 3, pp. 95-98). With the angelic challenge to Isaiah as he ascends to heaven, \"How far shall he ascend who dwells among aliens?\" (Ascenls 9:If.), cf. 3 Enoch 2:If. and 6:2. The theme of the angels praising God \"with one voice,\" found in Ascension of Isaiah 7:15, 8:18, and 9:28, is paralleled in the Merkabah tradition (see Scholem, Gnosticism, pp. 29f.). With Isaiah's participation in the celestial hymns, cf. 3 Enoch 1:11. Perhaps most significant of all is the setting which Ascension of Isaiah gives for Isaiah's vision (see 6:1-11). Isaiah makes his ascent in the presence of the king, his counselors, and"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"forty prophets and sons of prophets; there is a clear description of him falling into a trance (6:1 Of.), and it is stressed (6:17) that he did not impart his heavenly vision to anyone but the inner circle of Hezekiah, Jasub, and the remaining prophets. This whole picture is strongly reminiscent of the description of the Merkabah conventicle in Hekalot Rabbati 13-20 (BHM, vol. 3, pp. 93-98). Apocalypse of Abraham 15-2° In this work we find once again the pattern of an ascension through the seven heavens (ApAb 19) to God's throne, followed by a revelation of secrets. Abraham's heavenly guide is the archangel Jaoel, whose name (in the form Yaho'el) appears as one of the names of Metatron in 3 Enoch 48D:1. When God approaches Abraham in a frightening theophany, Abraham recites a hymn taught to him by Jaoel. Like the Merkabah hymns this is theurgical in character: It protects him from being consumed and it opens up the way to a vision of the Merkabah (ApAb 17-18). The Merkabah is described mainly in terms of Ezekiel 1 and Isaiah 6. The revelation that Abraham receives is a vision of the seven heavens, the earth, the garden of Eden, and the whole course of human history from Adam to the Messiah (ApAb 19-29; cf. this last element with 3En 45:3-5). THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS The Merkabah literature has links also with Qumran. Perhaps the closest parallels are in the following texts: The angelic liturgy (4QSirSabb) This poorly preserved text68 appears to give an elaborate account of the liturgy used by the angels in the heavenly temple. The first of the published fragments alludes to various orders of angels and mentions in particular seven \"sovereign princes\" {nesPe ros), i.e. archangels. The Qumran text uses the Hebrew term nesPim for the angels; the Merkabah texts normally call them sdrim\\ however, we find the expression nesPe kdbod (\"glorious princes\") in Seper HaRazim 5:4 (ed. Margalioth, p. 100). The second fragment contains a Merkabah piece, which is based on Ezekiel 1, but includes elements derived from Daniel 7 and 1 Kings 19. In line 1 it uses \"the Glory\" (hakkdbod) as a title of God (cf. above on TLevi 3:4) and it appears to refer to a heavenly tabernacle (miskdn); this may be compared with the tabernacle of Metatron in 3 Enoch 15B:1. It brings in from 1 Kings 19:12 (RSV) the \"still small voice\"; this motif is prominent in the Merkabah texts (see 3En 22C:5, n. m). Line 2 appears to read, \"there is a murmur of jubilation when they [i.e. the cherubim] raise their wings.\" The idea here may be similar to that in 3 Enoch 22:15: The cherubim raise their wings to praise God. Line 2 also refers to God's throne as the \"throne [kisse*] of the Merkabah\" and the \"seat of his glory\" (mwsb kbwdw); cf. the Merkabah designations \"throne of glory\" (kisse* hakkdbod) and \"seat of his glory\" (mosab haddro, mosab yeqaro) (see 3En 1:6, n. j, and 22:12, n. t). Ezekiel 1:26 and 10:1 only refer to a \"throne\" (kisse\"). Lines 4-5 seem to distinguish between the galgallim and the ophanim (cf. 3En 19 and 25). Line 5 possibly refers to \"streams of fire\";69 cf. the \"river(s) of fire\" in the Merkabah texts (e.g. 3En 19:4). Finally, we should note in line 8 the reference to \"the camps of the 5elohim\" (mhny Hwhym). Here 'elohim is probably not a designation of God but of the angels in general or of an angelic order (cf. 3En 15B: 1, n. c); the idea is probably as in the Merkabah texts (3En 1:6, n. i) that the angelic choirs are organized into \"camps.\" The heavenly Melchizedek (IJQMelch) In this text70 Melchizedek appears as being exalted over all the angels. It is stated that he will preside over a heavenly assize and exact punishment, with the help of the other angels, 68 J. Strugnell, \"The Angelic Liturgy at Qumran,\" VT Sup 7 (1959) 318-45. A fragment of the same work was unearthed at Masada (MasSirSabb): see Y. Yadin, \"The Excavations at Masada,\" IEJ 15 (1965) 81f., 105-8. There are other, unpublished Merkabah fragments from cave 4 at Qumran. 69 If this is, indeed, what is meant by Sybyly '$ or Sbwly '£; Strugnell reports that later, in an unpublished fragment, there is a reference to nhry 'wr, \"rivers of fire.\" 70 A.

L. Horton, The Melchisedek Tradition (Cambridge, 1976) pp. 64-82."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"from Belial and his minions. In view of the priestly functions of Melchizedek in the Bible (Gen 14:8; Ps 110:4), van der Woude has conjectured that at Qumran Melchizedek may have been regarded as the high priest of the heavenly Temple and identified with the archangel Michael, who fulfills the role of the heavenly high priest in rabbinic tradition (Hagigah 12b; cf. MidraS hannecelam, Lek leka, quoted in M. M. Kasher, Torah Selemah, Genesis, vol. 3 [Jerusalem, 1931] p. 615, no. Ill; Yalqut HadaS, MaPakim no. 19 [Warsaw, 1879] p. 122).71 However, all of this is very uncertain. A number of clear parallels between the heavenly Melchizedek of Qumran and the Metatron of 3 Enoch at once suggest themselves: both figures hold exalted, if not pre-eminent, positions among the angels; both are heavenly judges (for Metatron's court see 3En 16:1), and both, apparently, had earthly lives prior to their exalted, heavenly states. Physiognomies (4QCryptic) Like the Merkabah mystics the Qumran community was interested in physiognomy. 4QCryptic contains fragments of several texts which apparently attempted to establish that there is a significant relationship between a man's physical features, the astrological conditions prevalent at the time of his birth, and the number of parts his spirit possesses in the House of Light and in the Pit of Darkness.72 Another text from Qumran cave 4 (4QMess ar) refers to the distinguishing physical marks of someone who is called \"the elect of God\"; the first editor of this fragment thought that the reference is to the Messiah.73 Gruenwald has published some physiognomies which apparently emanated from Merkabah circles (see Tarbis 40 [1971] 301-19). He has attempted to show that there are significant parallels between these Merkabah physiognomies and 4QCryptic (pp. 304f.). For example, his second fragment, 3/1 line 3 (p. 317), and 4QCryptic (1) 3:4 both seem to speak of \"thick legs\" (sdqayim cdbot) as an important distinguishing physical trait. He has further pointed out that the lentil-shaped marks (tlwphyn) on the body, mentioned in the Qumran messianic text (4QMess ar 1:2) are paralleled in a Merkabah physiognomy published by Scholem (Seper Assap [Jerusalem, 1953] p. 491, 1. 1: \"And the signs, some are like lentils ['addsdh] and some are like the seeds of cucumbers\"), though the precise word for lentil is different in each case. MERKABAH LITERATURE 3 Enoch cannot be fully understood unless it is related to the corpus of Merkabah texts of which it forms a part. The parallels between 3 Enoch and the other Merkabah tracts will not be pursued here; they are amply covered elsewhere, in the introduction and in the notes to the translation. Some of the texts still remain in manuscript, or have been published only in part, or in very faulty editions. The more important printed editions are as follows: 1.

Cultural importance WITHIN JUDAISM Merkabah mysticism has made a contribution to Jewish life and thought in three main areas: (1) the liturgy of the synagogue; (2) the mystical theology of the Haside 'ASkenaz; and (3) the Spanish Qabbalah. The synagogue liturgy The Merkabah mystics had some influence on the development of synagogue hymnology. Two synagogue hymns will serve to illustrate this point. The first is 'El 'ddon cal kol hamma'asim (\"God, the Lord over all works\"), which is used in the morning service for sabbaths; it is found in all the prayer books, apart from Sacadya's Siddur. This hymn praises God as the one who is \"exalted above the holy creatures {hayyot] and is adorned in glory above the Merkabah\"; it speaks of 44purity and rectitude before his throne, loving-kindness and mercy before his glory,\" and it ends, 4'All the hosts on high render praise to him, the seraphim, the ophanim, the holy creatures ascribing glory and greatness.\" This is probably an example of a hymn composed by a poet who was acquainted with Merkabah ideas and used them to enrich his composition. The second example seems to provide a clear case of a Merkabah hymn which was composed within the mystical circles, but later appropriated for public use. It is the Ha'adderet wehd'emundh lehay coldmim (\"Excellence and faithfulness are his who lives for ever\"), which is found in the 'ASkenazi prayer books as the sixteenth section of the Qerobah 'Emeykd ndsd'ti for the morning service on Yom Kippur. The Qerobah is attributed to Meshullam b. Kalonymus (10th-l 1th cent, A.D.), but it seems that he did not compose this particular hymn; he simply lifted it bodily from the Merkabah traditions with which he was acquainted. It can be found in Hekalot Rabbati 26:7 (BHM, vol. 3, p. 103).74 There is nothing obviously 74 See I. Davidson, Thesaurus of Mediaeval Hebrew Poetry (New York, 1924) vol. 1, p. 139, n. 2976, and vol. 2 (1929) p. 116, n. 16."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"mystical about this composition; however, it is a classic example of the \"polylogy\" of the Merkabah hymns, which was the basis of their theurgic power.75 The Haside 'Askenaz Merkabah literature played a central role in shaping the theology of the medieval German-Jewish mystics known as the Haside 'ASkenaz. For example, Eleazar b. Judah of Worms (c. A.D. 1165—c. 1230) frequently quotes the Merkabah tracts in his voluminous writings (see esp. his Sode Razayya', pt. 2, Sod hammerkabah, published by Israel Kamelhar [Bilgoraj, 1936] under the title Sode RazayycP). He gives many substantial and exact quotations from 3 Enoch. The interest of the Haside 'ASkenaz in these mystical tracts is evidenced by the fact that the vast majority of our surviving Hekalot texts exist in late medieval copies that emanated from their circle. German Jewry may have been first introduced to the Merkabah literature by the Kalonymus family, which emigrated from southern Italy to the Rhineland in the ninth century, and which came to hold an eminent position among German Jews (Eleazar was a Kalonymide). It is possible that the Merkabah texts were first brought to southern Italy by Aaron of Baghdad, who arrived there in the ninth century. Tradition has it that Aaron was a great master of mystical lore (see Megillat 3Ahimacas, ed. A. Neubauer, Mediaeval Jewish Chronicles, vol. 2 [Oxford, 1895] p. 112; ed. B. Klar [Jerusalem, 1944] p. 13), and Eleazar bears witness that Aaron met Moses b. Kalonymus at Lucca and transmitted to him \"all his secrets.\"76 The Spanish Qabbalah The influence of the Merkabah traditions on the development of Jewish mysticism in medieval Spain may be illustrated from the Zohar, the most important text of the Spanish Qabbalah (composed probably by Moses de Leon in the late 13th cent. A.D.). There can be no doubt that the author of this work was acquainted with Merkabah traditions and that they helped to shape his thought. Thus in two passages he reworks, at considerable length, the Merkabah teachings about the seven heavenly palaces (Zohar Bere'sit 1.38a-45a, and Pequde 2.244b-262b). Metatron is also frequently mentioned in the Zohar (e.g. Zohar Wayehi 1.223b: \"From beneath her feet went forth a Youth [Nacar = Metatron] who stretched from one end of the world to the other . . . and who is called 'Enoch, the son of Yared'\"). But in many instances the concept of Metatron has been developed far beyond the comparatively simple ideas of the Merkabah mystics (see e.g. Zohar Mispattm 2.94a/b).77 The author of the Zohar often refers to the \"Book of Enoch\" as one of his authorities; some of these references correspond reasonably well to 3 Enoch (see e.g. Zohar Wayehi 1.223b, and Bere'sit 1.37b); however, the correspondences are never very exact, and there is much material attributed to this \"Book of Enoch\" which could never conceivably have formed part of 3 Enoch (see e.g. Zohar Prologue 1.13a, and Mispdtim 2.100a).78 75 On the influence of the Merkabah mystics on the synagogue liturgy see I. Elbogen, Der jiidische Gottesdienst in seiner geschichtliche Entwicklung (Frankfurt am Main, 1931) pp. 377—81; P. Bloch, \"Die Yorede Merkabah, die Mystiker der Gaonenzeit, und ihr Einfluss auf die Liturgie,\" MGWJ 37 (1893) 18-25, 69-74, 257-66, 305-11. Gruenwald and others have argued for the influence of Merkabah traditions on the early Palestinian liturgical poet Yannai; see Gruenwald, Tarbis 36 (1966/67) 257-77; cf. Z. M. Rabbinowitz, \"The Relationship of the Payyetan Yannai to Hekhalot and Merkabah Literature,\" Tarbis 36 (1966/67) 402-5 (in Heb.). The influence is hard to deny; see e.g. Yannai's QeduSta' for Yom Kippur, which begins Missod Hakdmim umillemed haberim (ed. Zulay, pp. 328-42, no. 132). 76 See A. Neubauer, REJ 23 (1891) 230-37; see H. Gross, in MGWJ 49 (1905) 692-700. On the influence of Merkabah mysticism on medieval German Hasidism see Scholem, Major Trends, pp. 84-87; J. Dan, The Mysticism of the Haside 'Askenaz (Jerusalem, 1968) (in Heb.). 77 On Metatron in the Zohar and in related mystical texts, see Odeberg, 3 Enoch, pt. 1, pp. 111-25; Margalioth, MaTake 'Elyon, pp. 73-108. 78 For references to this \"Book of Enoch\" in the Zohar see Odeberg, 3 Enoch, pt. 1, p. 22; Margalioth, MaTake *Elyon, pp. 80-3; BHM, vol. 3, pp. 195f. Moses de Leon in his MiSkan haedut also has a long quotation from a \"Book of Enoch\": for the text see BHM, vol. 2, p. xxxi."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"OUTSIDE JUDAISM The influence of Merkabah mysticism outside the Jewish tradition is extremely hard to document. Its possible links with Gnosticism were explored above. The following are some notes on other areas which would be worth investigating. Odeberg (3 Enoch, pt. 1, pp. 64-79) tried to establish that there are significant parallels between 3 Enoch and the literature of the Mandaean community of southern Iraq. J. Greenfield is skeptical about these parallels and asserts that they \"are mostly verbal and are on the whole meaningless\" (prolegomenon to KTAV reprint of Odeberg's 3 Enoch, p. xxxix). Two things should, however, be borne in mind: first, Metatron and the curtain ipargod) have turned up on a Mandaean incantation bowl; and, second, the Mandaeans were, for several centuries, in close historical contact with the rabbinic communities of Babylonia in which Merkabah mysticism flourished. Following N. Sed's interesting study \"Les hymns sur le paradis de Saint Ephrem et les traditions juives,\" Le Museon 81 (1968) 455-501, it would seem to be worth investigating the possibility of Jewish Merkabah speculation having had some influence on Syriac Christian writers. As we noted above, H. Graetz argued that the Merkabah doctrine of Sicur Qomah was influenced by anthropomorphic views of God held by certain Islamic thinkers. Though this is a mistaken notion, the parallels to which he pointed remain. It is possible that the influence worked in the other direction, and that the Islamic mushabbiha thinkers drew on Jewish Merkabah traditions."},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"SELECT BIBLIOGRAPHY Charlesworth, PMR, pp. 106f.

Then he vanished because God took him.\" Gen5:24 1 1 Rabbi Ishmael\" said: When I ascended to the height to behold the vision of the chariot,1 I entered Ezek i 2 six palaces, one inside the other,d #and when I reached the door of the seventh is.i palace I paused in prayer before the Holy One, blessed be he; I looked up and 3 said: •\"Lord of the Universe, grant, I beseech you, that the merit of Aaron, son of Amram, lover of peace and pursuer of peace/ who received on Mount Ex 24:9f.; 28:i Sinai the crown of priesthood in the presence of your glory, may avail for me now, so that Prince QaspPel/ and the angels with him, may not prevail over 1 a. Chs. 1 f. provide a setting for the revelations that follow. It is not clear whether they were added to chs. 3-48A by the final redactor of 3En, or whether they had already been introduced at an earlier stage as a preface to a shorter form of the work (e.g. chs. 3-15/16). Chs. If. contain many parallels to the rest of the book. Two are particularly striking: (1) the way in which Ish­mael, when he ascends to heaven, is challenged by the archangels and defended by God is similar to the challenge and defense of Enoch on his ascent (cf. I:7f. and 2:1-3 with 4:7f. and 6:21'.); (2) the bestowal of spiritual gifts on Ishmael is exactly matched by the bestowal of spiritual gifts on Enoch (cf. 1:1 If. with 8:If.). It is possible that chs. If. have been pieced together from material lifted from the rest of the work. On the other hand, the parallelism could have deeper significance: It may be meant to suggest that the ascent of Ishmael (and so of every adept) is in certain respects analogous to the elevation of Enoch. b. A famous Palestinian scholar who died before A.D. 132. There is a rabbinic tradition that he was of priestly descent (b.Ket 105b; b.Hull 49a; t.Hall 1:10). but he cannot have been high priest since he was only a child when the Temple was destroyed in A.D 70 (b.Gitt 58a). In view of the privileged relationship of the high priest to God. the mystics had a vested interest in claiming that their master held the supreme priestly office. Ishmael s name was early linked with mystical lore: b.Ber 7a claims that as high priest he had a vision in the Holy of Holies of \" 'Aktari'el Yah. the Lord of Hosts, sitting on a high and lofty throne\" (cf. 3En 15B:4). and b.Ber 51a mentions three things which he is supposed to have learned from the Prince of the Divine Presence; note further the interpretation of 'Aza'zel (Lev 16:8) attributed to \"the school of Ishmael\" in b. Yoma 67b. R. Ishmael appears as the narrator in a number of other Merkabah texts; see Hekalot Rabbati. Ma'aseh Merkabah (though in this work he is closely associated with R. Aqiba). and the Cairo Genizah Hekalot (note e.g. A/2, 34. ed. Gruenwald, p. 366. and B/l. 18, ed.

They said before the Holy Job i:6 the idea is that they were seventy of God's own names which he bestowed on Metatron (thus symbolizing the transfer to Metatron of some of his power). This is probably the sense of the reading \"seventy names . . . similar to the name of the King\" (see n. b above). Cf. b.Sanh 38b, \"Metatron . . . whose name is similar to that of his Master,\" and Re'uyot Yebezqe'l. BM, vol. 2. p. 132, I. 14 (ed.

They opposed the creation of man. so God destroyed them. The same fate befell a second company, but a third company allowed man to be created. However, when the generation of the Flood came, these angels said: \"Lord of the Universe, did not the first company of angels speak aright?\" God replied. \"Even to old age I am the same, and even to grey hairs will I carry\" (Isa 46:4). This tradition has been adapted here: (1) The third company of angels is identified with 'Uzzah, 'Azzah, and 'Aza'el; (2) the charge brought against mankind in general is incongruously applied specifically to Enoch: (3) the point of the expression \"the first ones\" (i.e. the first company of angels) has been obscured.

His soul was alarmed to the point of leaving him because of his fear, dread, and terror of me, when he saw me seated upon a throne like a king, with ministering angels standing beside me as servants and all the princes of 3 kingdoms crowned with crownsf surrounding me. #Then he opened his mouth 12:3: i8:i 4 and said, \"There are indeed two powers in heaven!\"8 •Immediately a divine voiceh came out from the presence of the Sekinah' and said, \"Come back to 5 me, apostate sons—apart from 3Aher!\" •Then cAnapPelJ YHWH, the honored, Jer3:22 glorified, beloved, wonderful, terrible, and dreadful Prince, came at the com- 6:i mand of the Holy One, blessed be he, and struck me with sixty lashes of firek and made me stand to my feet. 16 a. Ch. 16 is probably a secondary addition to chs. 3-15: It runs counter to the whole tenor of the foregoing description of the role of Me­tatron, and is probably aimed at minimizing his powers: cf. the gloss at 10:3, and see further \"Historical Importance\" for evidence of concern over the powers of Metatron. Such a story would hardly have originated in the mystical circles responsible for the traditions in chs. 3-15; it must have come from elsewhere. Its most obvious source is the account of the humbling of Metatron in b.Hag 15a. The talmudic version of the story probably has priority over the one quoted here. Allusions to the humbling of Metatron and to many other ideas in 3-16 are found in Cairo Genizah Hekalot A/2, 13-18 (ed. Gruenwald, pp. 362f.): \"A youth [na'ar] comes out to meet you from behind the throne of glory. Do not bow down to him—for his crown is as the crown of his King, and the sandals on his feet are as the sandals of his King, and the robe [hdluq] upon him is as the robe [haluq] of his King ... his eyes blaze like torches, his eyeballs burn like lamps; his brilliance is as the brilliance of his King, his glory is as the glory of his Maker— Zehobadyah is his name.\" b. \"A great throne,\" A C Mus.

Chs. 17-40, which form the third major division of 3En, contain the discourses of Me­tatron on the heavenly world. The material falls into three rough sections: Chs. 17-28/29 deal with the angelic hierarchies; chs. 29/30-33 de­scribe the sessions of the heavenly law court: chs. 34-40 are concerned with the recitation of the celestial Sanctus. Once again disparate tra­ditions have been combined: There are three originally distinct angelologies (the first in ch. 17; the second in ch. 18; the third in 19-22; 25:1-28:6) and several different accounts of the heavenly assize, and of the performance of the celestial QeduSSah.

Cf. the \"seven angels who were created first\" in Masseket Hekalot 7 (BHM. vol. 2, p. 46, I. 30), and the seven Protoktistoi in Clement of Alexandria, Eclogae propheticae 57.1. c. \"Michael . . . Sidri'el\": the list of angels here and in vs. 3 follows A and, substantially, Mus. As usual, the vocalization of some names is uncertain. d. On the seven heavens see \"Theological Importance.\" It is clear from the parallel passage in b.Hag 12b that, apart from Wilon (on which see n. f below), the various names of the heavens are derived by exegesis from Scripture. e. \"Which is in RaqiaV Lemb; \"which is in the height of RaqiaV A B: \"which is in Samayim,\" Mus. f. \"The first heaven, which is in Wilon,\" Mus; \"the first heaven, which is in Wilon, which is in Samayim,\" A. Wilon as a name for the first heaven appears to have originated among Babylonian Jews, whereas Samayim is the stand­ard Palestinian term. Wilon, derived from the Lat. velum, \"curtain,\" \"veil.\" denotes an or­dinary door curtain in rabbinic Heb. (m.Kel 20:6; m.Neg 11:11). It would seem, then, that the first heaven is regarded as a sort of veil or curtain which either conceals the heavenly world from human eyes, or which, by being opened and shut, is the cause of daylight and darkness. b.Hag 12b describes its function thus: \"It does not serve for anything, but enters in the morning and leaves in the evening and renews every day the work of creation\" (cf. MidraS Konen. BHM. vol. 2. pp. 36f.; Seder Rabbah diBere'su. BM, vol. 1. p. 39: Baraita' di Ma'aseh Bere'Sit. ed. Sed. A 70-72; B 58f.). Note also MidraS 'aseret hadibberot (BHM. vol. I, pp. 63f.): \"The Holy One, blessed be he. created seven heavens. The lowest of them is called Wilon and it is like a curtain [wilon] drawn across the doorway of a house, so that those within can see those without, but those without cannot see those within.\" See further. b.Ber 58b; ARN A 37 (ed. Schechter, 55b); Midras Tehillim 19:6 (ed. Buber, 83a-b), and 114:2 (ed. Buber, 236a).

An angelic hierarchy 18 R. Ishmael said: Metatron, Prince of the Divine Presence, the glory of highest heaven, said to me: The angels of the first heaven, when they see their Prince, they dismount from n:3 their horses8 and fall prostrate.      zech i:8 bodies are classified into four groups: sun, moon, constellations, and stars (i.e. planets). They are assigned to the second heaven (Raqia*), and their orbits (in diminishing length) are given. In 46:1-4 and probably also in 5:8, the heavenly bodies are animate beings; here they are inert masses which the angels trundle through the heavens. For this latter idea see lEn 80:1; 4Ezra 6:3; 3Bar 6:2. Astronomy forms an element in some apoc­alyptic texts; see e.g. lEn 72-82. It is, strictly speaking, a motif of Ma'aseh Bere'Sit (see \"The­ological Importance\"). j. \"Under them,\" A Mus. k. \"88 angels,\" A B; \"85 angels,\" Mus. 1. \"354,000\": This figure is a multiple of the number of days in the lunar year (1 lunar month = 294 days). m. \"When does the moon stand,\" A Mus; \"when does the moon sit,\" B. n.

In favor of the former view is the fact that the princes of kingdoms, like the angels of the heavenly bodies, are here located in the second heaven. Note also 38:3, where the Prince of the World (who in 30:2 is said to be the leader of the princes of kingdoms) exercises authority over the heavenly bodies. In favor of the latter view is the fact that in 18:2 the princes of kingdoms are placed on the hierarchical ladder above the seven princes of the seven heavens. r. \"72 nations,\" B; \"70 nations,\" A Mus. The division of mankind into seventy or seventy-two nations is based on a count of the names in the Table of the Nations in Gen 10.

Buber, 159a; cf. m.Sot 7:5; b.Shab 88b), and this idea may be as old as 1 En 89:59 (the' 'seventy shepherds\"). However, there are variations: e.g. MidraS Haggadol to Gen 10:1 reckons sixty nations, but to Gen 10:32 speaks of seventy-two languages; normally the number of languages correlates with the number of nations in the world; see margin. s. \"Decked with royal jewels,\" A and, sub­stantially, Mus. t. \"Royal servants,\" A Mus. 18 a. \"Horses\": emending to susim; A B have the singular \"horse\" (sits).

The angelology of ch. 18 was originally independent of that in ch. 17.

The River of Fire is a standard motif in the descriptions of the Merkabah; it is derived from Dan 7:10. We find references to one River of Fire (A Mus and 36:1); four rivers of fire (B and 19:4; 37:1); and seven rivers of fire (33:4). The usual name for the River of Fire is Nehar diNur, which is taken from Dan 7:10, but it is also called Rigyon. The meaning of the latter name is uncertain. The bridges which span the River of Fire were a subject of speculation; see 3En 22B:1; 22C:1.

The construction of the angelic names in chs. 19-22 and 25-28 (apart from Radweri'el in 27:1) is transparent: They are made up of an element corresponding to the function of the angel plus the theophoric ending 'el. Thus Rikbi'el is rekeb, \"chariot\" (a synonym of merkabah). plus 'el, \"God.\" On the formation of the angelic names see 14:4, n. d. and \"The­ological Importance.\" However, since Rikbi'el is in charge of the \"wheels of the chariot\" (galgalle hammerkdbdh), the name Galgalli'el would have been more obvious; see 14:4; 17:4. c. \"The wheels\" (galgallim) are derived from Ezek 10:13, where it is implied that they are the same as the ophanim. In the present angelological system they are different from ophanim; see 25:5-7. In the Hekalot texts the word galgal has several senses: (1) It denotes the literal wheels of the chariot (see 15:1; 41:2; Masseket Hekalot 7, BHM, vol. 2, p. 45, 1. 20; this is probably the meaning here); (2) it denotes a class of angels (see 6:2; Masseket Hekalot 5. BHM, vol. 2, p. 43, I. 17); (3) it denotes the \"orb\" {galgal) of the sun, in contrast to the \"globe\" ('dpdn) of the moon (see I7:4f.). In medieval Jewish texts the galgallim are the heavenly spheres; see e.g. Ibn Gabirol, Keter Malkut 14, I. 131, and cf. b.BB 74a. d. \"Between them . . . their wheels\": The exact sense is obscure; \"forming a circle . . . stand\" is muqqdpin we'dmedim in Heb., but the muqqdpin. \"forming a circle,\" is redundant.

The reference here is to the \"judgment of the grave\" (din haqqeber), which each man undergoes when he dies; see Masseket bibbut haqqeber. 2 (BHM, vol.

On the lashes of fire see margin and cf. the \"chain half-fire, half-iron\" with which the Angel of Death beats the dead man (BHM. vol. 1, p. 151. II. If.); also Ma'aseh deRabbi YehoSua' b. Levi.

The passage on the divine judgment in 28:7-10 forms the climax of the angelology of chs. 19-28. Different traditions have been combined in chs. 30-33: Contrast 31:1 with 33:1 (see 33:1. n. a); it seems very likely that each of the present chs. originally formed an independent unit of tradition. b. \"The Great Law Court\" (Bet din haggd-ddl): The heavenly law court is called either Bet din Selemaaldh or Pamalyd' selema'aldh. For the equivalence of these expressions (in certain contexts) cf. the form of R. Yobanan's dictum in y.Sanh 18a.59 with that in b.Sanh 38b: see further 12:5. n. f. The heavenly law court is mentioned frequently in rabbinic texts: See y.Ber 14c.l6;b.RH 8b;b.Makk 13b, 14a: b.Shab 21a; b.Ter 3a/b; b.Sanh 99b; GenR 12:1: EcclR 2:12.1: LevR 29:4. In 3En 30 the heavenly law court is said to meet at a fixed time daily; cf. 28:7 and contrast b.RH 16a, which speaks of judgment being passed on New Year's Day. The court is made up of the seventy-two princes of kingdoms: Contrast the accounts of the workings of the heavenly law court in 18:20-24; 26:12: and 28:7-9.

Cf. Pesiqta' deRab Kahana 12:22 (ed.

Raphael\": see also Midras Tehillim 68:10 (to Ps 68:17. \"The Lord is in them\") (ed. Buber. 160a). There is presumably a difference between being \"called YHWH\" and having a name \"based on\" the name YHWH (see 29:1: 3:2). e. \"Princes of kingdoms\": See margin and \"Theological Importance.\" For the idea that each nation has its angelic representative see Mekilta' deRabbi 'Isma'el.

The earthly Sanhedrin had only seventy or seventy-one members according to m.Sanh 1:6. but m.Zeb 1:3 and m.Yad 4:2 speak of \"72 members of the college.\" f. \"The Prince of the World.\" ABE: \"one Prince.\" F. If we take this vs. in conjunction with 10:3 it would appear that Metatron is the Prince of the World: see \"Theological Impor­tance.\" 31 a. \"Justice [sedeq] . . . Mercy [hesed]\": Cf. Ps 89:14: \"Righteousness [sedeq] and Justice support your throne. Love [hesed] and Faithful­ness are your attendants.\" The relationship be­tween the divine attributes of \"justice\" (din) and \"compassion (rahamim)\" is a common problem of rabbinic texts; see b.Ber 7a: GenR 8:4; ARN A 37 (ed. Schechter. 55b). The name YHWH is linked with \"mercy\" and 'Elohim with \"jus­tice\"; see SifDeut 26 (end) (ed. Finkelstein. p. 41): GenR 33:3; but contrast Mekilta' deRabbi 'Isma'el, Sirah 3 (ed. Horovitz-Rabin. p. 128. I. 6). For the conflict between Mercy and Justice in the divine judgment see 3En 18:19-21 and 33:1. Note further the idea of God's two thrones— one of Justice and one of Mercy (b.Hag 14a: b.Sanh 38b: b. AZ 3b: LevR 39:3). Mercy usually triumphs over Justice; Mekilta' deRabbi 'Isma'el, Mispatim 18 (ed. Horovitz-Rabin, p. 314); cf. t.Sot 4:1 and contrast GenR 26:6 (end). The procedures of the earthly Sanhedrin leaned to the side of leniency: see m.Sanh 1:6: 5:5. For hypostatization of the divine attribute of justice see b.Shab 55a; Alphabet of Aqiba, BHM. vol. 3. p. 50. I. 19 (cf. b.Sanh 97b: 103a: b.Pes 119a). b. \"And Truth stands.\" A E F. c. \"A man,\" B; \"a wicked man.\" A E F. d. \"For judgment\": presumably just after death; see 28:10. e. \"A staff, as it were\": Heb. kemaqqel. The idea obviously is that Mercy extends to the man its protection, but the language is awkward. Perhaps read z/V for mizziw: \"The splendor of Mercy extends towards him, like a staff, und takes up position in front of him.\" There appears to be an allusion here to a passage in b.Sanh 108a. b.Sanh 108a quotes Ezek 7.11: \"Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness [lemaueh reSa\"]; none of them shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of their wealth: neither shall there be wailing for them.\" Then it cites a comment of R. Eleazar on this obscure verse: \"This teaches that violence erected itself like a staff [kemaqqel]. stood before the Holy One, blessed be he, and said before him: 'Lord of the Universe, none of them shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of their wealth: neither shall there be wailing for them!' \" Violence personified is here seen as accusing the generation of the Flood in the heavenly law court: the staff is presumably a symbol of chastisement. In 3En 31, however, the idea has been transposed: The staff is now wielded by Mercy in the heavenly court and has become a symbol of protection. The connection between \"violence\" and \"staff\" in b.Sanh 108a must surely be original, since the connection was derived from Ezek 7:11. 3En 31 presupposes R. Eleazar's exegesis in b.Sanh 108a. f. \"Angels of destruction\": mentioned fre­quently in rabbinic texts. They have two main functions: (I) to exact punishment from the wicked in this world: see 32:1; 33:1: b.Shab 55a. 88a; b.Pes 112b: Hekalot Rabbati 5:3 (BHM. vol. 3. p. 87); Alphabet of Aqiba, BHM. vol. 3, pp. 50f. and p. 62, 1. 3: cf. 1 En 53:3: 56:1: 63:1: (2) to act as warders, torturers (and purifiers) of the souls in hell: see 44:2; b.Ket 104a; b.Sanh 106b; Masseket Gehinnom I (BHM. vol. 1. p. 147, I. 19); Midras Konen.

In Alphabet of Aqiba, BHM, vol. 3, p. 62, 1. 4, the angels of destruction are said to wield a sword. The sword (hereb) of God is a common end-time image in the OT; see Deut 32:41; Isa 27:1; 34:5: 66:16; Ezek 21:3. Cf. the \"great sword\" that was given to the sheep (Israel) to wreak God's judgment on their enemies in I En 90:19, 34; 91:11; see also 1 En 88:2 and Rev 19:15.

In GenR 21:9 the fiery sword of Gen 3:24 is personified as fiery angels. d. The language is reminiscent of descriptions of the end-time (cf.

For angels of mercy see Hilkot hakkisse' (BM. add. 27199, fol. 139a): \"211 myriads of angels of mercy are standing beside the Throne and they plead in favour of Israel\" (quoted from Odeberg).

The closest parallel is Seder Rabbah diBere'Sit, BM, vol. 1. p. 27, 1. 22: \"Some say that the world is round and the sea goes round the world like a skullcap [kemin kippdh].\" There it means \"in a circle.\" Note also b.Hag 14b: \"The heavens became overcast and a kind of bow [kemin qeSet] appeared in the cloud.\" k. \"Each one\": emendation, reading kdl \\ehdd) for B's unintelligible wkT and A E F's wklh. 1. \"'Arabot. . .

Ch. 34, which depicts the phenomena of heaven as arranged in concentric circles round the Merkabah (see n. c below), was linked to ch. 33 on the catchword principle: Cf. 34:1, \"The hooves of the creatures,\" with 33:4, \"the feet of the holy creatures.\" Ch. 34 ends with a reference to the celestial QeduSsah. This leads naturally into a section (chs. 35-40) concerned with the same subject. b. ' The hooves of the creatures'': Heb. par sat ragle hahayydt; so A E F.

Ishmael said: The angel Metatron, Prince of the Divine Presence, said to me: i. \"The yoke of the kingdom\": To accept \"the yoke of the kingdom of heaven\" is to acknowledge God's sovereignty. Cf. the Yoser prayer: \"Be Thou blessed, O our Rock . . . Creator of ministering spirits, all of whom stand in the heights of the universe, and proclaim with awe and unison aloud the words of the living God and everlasting King . . . And they all take upon themselves the yoke of the kingdom of heaven\" (Singer, pp. 39f.). Jews accept the yoke when they recite the Sema' (m.Ber 2:2: SifNum 115, ed. Horovitz, p. 126). The Sema' benedic­tion, \"Blessed be the name of his glorious kingdom for ever and ever\" (t.Ta'an 1:13; b.Pes 56a), is introduced into the celestial QedusSah in 3En 39:2; cf. 48B:2. j. 4 The kingdom of the High and Exalted One who created them all\": Heb. malkut ram wenissa' yoser kulldm; so A E F.

Gruenwald, p. 126): \"The angels stretch out their hands and take some fire from the River of Fire and cleanse their lips and their tongues\" (note the echo of Isa 6:6f.). e. \"In the fire of the River of Fire,\" A E F; \"in the fire.\" B. f. \"And don garments of haSmal\": the text contains several unintelligible words. A (which is well supported by the other MSS) reads: weldbeSin lebuS mhmqy sml we'dtepin tply fjaS-mal. \"and don garments of ... and wrap themselves in . . . of hasmal.\" All that it seems possible to say is that mhmqy sml must conceal the name of a substance parallel to haSmal and tply a word corresponding to lebuS. Perhaps for the latter read me'He (\"and wrap themselves in cloaks oihaSmal\"); cf. 17:8; 18:25: Seder Rab­bah diBere'Sit. BM, vol. 1, p. 46. I. 20; Seper HaRazim 7:16f. (ed. Margalioth. p. 108); Req-anati's quotation from Seper Hekalot in BHM. vol. 2, p. xvii. g. \"In every heaven\": It is not clear whether this goes with \"stand\" or with \"throne of glory.\" If it is construed with the former then the sense would be that the angels in every heaven line up facing the throne of glory in the seventh heaven. If it is construed with the latter then the sense would be that there is a throne of glory in each of the seven heavens, and that the angels stand facing the throne in their respective heavens. The second interpretation is supported by the tradition that there is a Merkabah in each heaven (see 37:1, n. a). According to Ascenls 7:13-9:2 there is a throne in every heaven (except the sixth), though it is not clear whether these thrones belong to God, or to the angelic princes who rule over the various heavens (cf. 3En 17)."},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"Four chariots of the Sekinah stand in the seven palaces,8 and before each of is:3 them stand four camps of the Sekinah.

There are three possible explanations why unborn souls may be called \"righteous\": (1) Souls may be created \"right­eous\" and \"unrighteous\"; see WisSol 8:I9f.; 4Mac 18:23; GenR 8:7; cf. b.BB 16a, \"God creates both the righteous and the wicked.\" (2) Unborn souls may be designated as \"righteous\" by God in virtue of his foreknowledge of the righteous lives they live on earth; so GenR 8:7 (on another interpretation). (3) \"Righteous\" may be loosely used to express the idea that all souls before birth are pure; see b.Shab 152b; EcclR 12:7.1; and the benediction 'Eldhay neSdmdh, recited on waking from sleep: \"O my God. the soul which thou gavest me is pure\" (Singer, p. 5; cf. b.Ber 60b). d. \"He led me,\" E F; \"he bore me up,\" A B. e. \"To the throne of glory\": A B add \"to the abode of the Sekinah, and he revealed to the throne of glory.\" The text follows E F. f. Ishmael is not shown the unborn souls as promised in vs. 1. There may be a lacuna in the text. g. \"That 'the spirit shall clothe itself in my presence,' \" A F. h. \"The souls of the righteous\": emendation (cf. vs. 1). The MSS misplace the expression after \"of beings.\" i. \"The storehouse of beings\": Heb. gup habberivvdt. This storehouse is mentioned in b.Yeb 62a; 63b; b.AZ 5a: b.Nidd 13b. Rashi explains the idea thus: \"There is a treasure-house Vdsdr] called gup, and at the time of creation all souls destined to be born were formed and placed there\" (to b.AZ 5a). \"Gup: A chamber like a body [gup]; the name for the special place for souls which are about to be born\" (to b.Nidd 13b). \"Gup: A curtain [pargdd] which forms a partition between the Sekinah and the angels, and there are placed spirits and souls created since the six days of creation, which are to be put into bodies yet to be created\" (to b.Yeb 63b). When this ch. of 3En speaks of \"souls which have been created\" and \"souls which have not yet been created\" it cannot mean creation in any absolute sense, but must refer to the entry of the soul into the body. Cf. b.Hag 12b, quoted in n. b above; see further Re'uyot Yebezqe'l, BM, vol. 2, p. 133, 1. 18 (ed. Gruenwald, p. 136). j.

This term re­fers, strictly speaking, to premature death in­flicted by God for certain sins (b.MK 28a; y.Bikk 64c.37). Here, however, it is not used literally, but to indicate the enormity of Israel's transgres­sions.

Friedmann. 185a.27), where Michael pleads for Israel before God. 45 a. \"The curtain [pargod] of the Omnipresent One\": This curtain is the heavenly counterpart of the Veil which divided the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies in the earthly Tabernacle and Temple (Ex 26:31; 2Chr 3:14). The earthly veil is called the pdrdket: the heavenly veil, though sometimes called a pdrdket, is more commonly designated the pargod. Pargod is a loanword from Persian: Cf. the PdfoVawpardag, \"curtain,\" \"veil,\" and the cognate Hindustani pardah, from which the English \"purdah\" is derived. The heavenly pargod separates the immediate pres­ence of God from the rest of heaven. It shields the angels from the destructive glare of the divine glory (Targum Job 26:9; cf. 3En 22B:6), and it conceals the ultimate mysteries of the deity; only the Prince of the Divine Presence is allowed to go within the curtain (cf. b.Yoma 77a). Some­times secrets are announced by a heavenly voice \"from behind the curtain\" (b.Ber 18b; b.Hag 15a; 16a; b.Sanh 89b; Ma'yan Hokmah, BHM, vol. 1, p. 60, 1. 10; Ma'aseh 'asarah haruge malkut, BHM, vol. 6, p. 21, 1. 32, and p. 31, 1. 28; MidraS \" 'Ellen 'ezkerah,\" BHM, vol. 3, p. 65, I. 25; MidraS 'aseret hadibberot, BHM, vol. 1, p. 81, 11. 3f.; Haggadat Sema' Yisra'el, BHM, vol. 5, p. 165, 11. 29f.; Masseket bibbut haqqeber 4; BHM, vol. 1. p. 152, I. 10). The idea in 3En 45 appears to be that the whole course of human history is already worked out \"in blueprint\" in the heavenly realm, and has been totally foreordained by God. Cf. the heav­enly tablets on which, according to Hekalot Rabbati 6:3 (BM, vol. 1. p. 76), all the trials foreordained for Israel are already recorded. On the pargod see further b.Sot 49a; b.BM 59a; PRE 4; Masseket Hekalot 7 (BHM, vol. 2, p. 46, 1. 30); Alphabet of Aqiba, BHM, vol. 3, p. 44, 11. 3, 9, and 16 (= BM, vol. 2, p. 388); Seder Gan 'Eden, BHM, vol. 3, p. 135, 1. 25. and p. 138, 1. 3; Rashi to b.Yeb 63b, catchword gup.

The verb sdraq means lit. \"to comb\": however, in view of the paral­lelism with \"oppressors,\" it must have a meta­phorical sense here. It probably means \"to tor­ment.\" \"to torture\"; there may be allusion to the story of the martyrdom of Aqiba: \"They brought out R. Aqiba to kill him. and they combed [sdreqin] his flesh with combs of iron\" (b.Ber 61b). The reference is to the Roman torture of hanging up a victim naked and scraping his body with \"claws\" (ungulae).

Odeberg translates: \"and he saw the heart within the heart of the Lion.\" He identifies the lion with one of the four creatures (Ezek 1:10). Eleazar reads: \"and he saw [werd'dh] that it was white [Idbdn; or, repointing libbdn, \"(that) their heart (was)\"] like the heart of the lion.\" The lion has magical significance; see Seper HaRazim 1:133-35 (ed.

COLLINS Sibylline oracles are a widely attested phenomenon in the ancient world. They are found invariably in epic Greek hexameters (perhaps under the influence of the Delphic oracle) but the phenomenon was not peculiar to Greece. Many of the alleged Sibyls were Asiatic and their type of prophecy is widely assumed to have come to Greece from the East, although there is no clear evidence to support (or refute) this view.1 No satisfactory etymology of the word \"Sibyl\" has been proposed,2 so no light is thrown on the phenomenon from this source. In the earliest attestations, from the fifth and fourth centuries B.C., the word \"Sibyl\" refers to a single individual.3 It is quite possible that the word was originally the proper name of a prophetess. The Sibyl is always depicted as an aged woman uttering ecstatic prophecies. Ovid tells us that she was granted by Apollo that she might live as many years as there were grains of sand on the seashore. However, she did not ask for youth, so she remained for thousands of years a shriveled, shrunken old woman.4 According to Heracleides Ponticus (c. 360-25 B.C.) the Sibyl was older than Orpheus.5 If any historical prophetess ever underlay the figure of the Sibyl, she was already lost in the mists of legend by the fifth century. According to Heraclitus she \"reaches through thousands of years\" with her voice.6 Her prophecy was even said to continue after her death, while her soul revolved in the face of the moon.7 She was sometimes thought to be intermediate between the divine and human state, and a coin from Erythrea refers to her as Thea Sibylla, \"the Goddess Sibyl.\"8 In Jewish tradition she was said to be a daughter (or daughter-in-law) of Noah.9 As from the fourth century B.C. we read of a number of Sibyls.10 The most famous Sibyls were those of Erythrea and Marpessus in Asia Minor and of Cumae in Italy.\" Various attempts were made in late antiquity to reduce the chaotic plurality to order by making lists. The most influential list was that of Varro, who enumerated ten, Persian, Libyan, Delphic, Cimmerian, Erythrean, Samian, Cumean, Hellespontian, Phrygian, and Tiburtine.12 Notably the Hebrew, Chaldean, and Egyptian Sibyls are omitted from this list. The Suda and the anonymous Prologue to the present collection of Sibylline Oracles repeat this list but identify the Persian Sibyl with the Hebrew. In the Middle Ages the number was increased to twelve, 1 See A. Rzach, \"Sibyllen,\" Pauly-Wissowa 2A (1923), cols. 2073f. 2 See the discussion of the various proposed etymologies by V. Nikiprowetzky, La Troisieme Sibylle, p. 2. 3 So Heraclitus, in Plutarch, De Pythiae oraculis 6 (397a); Aristophanes, Peace 1095-117; Plato, Phaedrus 244b. 4 Ovid, Metamorphoses 14.132. 5 Clement, Strom 1.108.1. Cf.

Kurfess, Sibyllinische Weissagungen, pp. 9-16. 12 Lactantius, Divlnst 1.6."},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"to correspond to the twelve apostles.13 We find a shorter list in Pausanias 10.12.1-9 where only four are mentioned: the Libyan Sibyl, Herophile of Marpessus (whom he identifies with the Delphic Erythrean and Samian Sibyls), Demo of Cumae, and Sabbe of the Hebrews (whom some call Babylonian, some Egyptian). The name of the Hebrew Sibyl, Sabbe or Sambethe (so the Suda and the anonymous Prologue to the Sibylline Oracles), is as enigmatic as the term \"Sibyl.\" Derivations range from Sibtu, Queen of Mari and the Queen of Sheba, to the Jewish sabbath or the divine epithet Sabaoth.14 There is no conclusive evidence to tie the name to any one etymology. Also obscure is the relation between the Hebrew Sibyl and the Babylonian (or Chaldean). Pausanias reports that some people identified Sabbe as a Babylonian Sibyl and said that she was daughter of Berossus. Berossus was a Chaldean priest who lived in the first quarter of the third century B.C. He was said to be an astrologer, and he wrote a history of Babylonia which began with the myths of the creation of the world and ended with a prediction of cosmic destruction.15 Such a well-known historical figure could not possibly be the father of the legendary Sabbe. In Sibylline Oracles 3.809f. the Sibyl says that she has come from Babylon. The same book, Sibylline Oracles 3.97-161, contains a description of the fall of the tower of Babel and a euhemeristic account of Greek mythology. Since the work of Bousset and Geffcken this passage has been widely accepted as a fragment of the Babylonian Sibyl.16 The relation of that Sibyl to Berossus is then explained by postulating that Berossus derived material from the Sibyl or vice versa. However, close examination of the passage in Sibylline Oracles 3 reveals no evidence of Babylonian origin.17 The story of the fall of the tower is a natural expansion of the biblical narrative. The euhemeristic account of Greek mythology may well be a borrowing from another source but there is no reason to suspect that the source was Babylonian. In fact there is no extant oracle or fragment that can be attributed to a Babylonian Sibyl.18 Such a Sibyl may possibly have existed but any alleged relationship to the Jewish Sibyl or to Berossus must be purely hypothetical. The outline of Berossus' history, which has a cosmic sweep from creation to final destruction, bears obvious analogy to many of the Sibylline books. This analogy may be due to a historical influence which cannot now be traced, but the analogy itself may have been enough to give rise to the supposed relationship between the Sibyl and Berossus. The nature of Sibylline oracles The most characteristic feature of Sibylline oracles is the prediction of woes and disasters to come upon mankind. In the words of the Erythrean Sibyl, the Sibyl was \"foreseeing on behalf of men hardships difficult to bear.\" In this they show some similarity to the Old Testament prophets, since \"from remote times the prophets . . . prophesied war, famine and plague for many countries and for great kingdoms\" (Jer 28:8). Further, like the prophets, their words of doom are often directed against specific peoples and cities, and occasionally, at least, a ray of hope does penetrate their message, indicating restoration after the destruction. The disasters are due to the wrath of the gods, which can be incurred by ritual offenses, but also, especially in the Jewish and Christian oracles, by ethical violations. The fragments of the pagan Sibyls which have survived are relatively brief and describe either the Sibyl herself and her relationship with the gods—especially Apollo—or woes to come upon specific 13 So the Chronicum paschale, ed.

The authenticity of the passage that refers to cosmic destruction (Seneca, Naturales quaestiones 3.29.1) has been questioned by Jacoby (FGH, vol. 3C, pp. 395-97) and others because it is the first such reference in Babylonian literature. However, this is not an adequate reason to reject the attribution. Berossus may well have derived the idea from a non-Babylonian source. 16 W.

For this reason some scholars tend to distinguish sharply between the early Sibylline oracles and the longer continuous oracles found in our collection, and see the prototype of the later Sibylline oracles in the long poem attributed to Lycophron, the Alexandra.20 Lycophron lived in the first half of the third century B.C., but since vss. 1446-50 of the poem seem to refer to the battle of Cynoscephalae in 197 B.C., many scholars think the attribution is false. The Alexandra consists of an allegorical ex eventu prophecy, put in the mouth of Alexandra or Cassandra, daughter of Priam, which dwells at length on the fate of the heroes after the Trojan War, but also (in vss. 1412-50) deals with Greek and Roman history in the hellenistic age. The poem is notoriously difficult, partly because of the allegorical language, which can be highly confusing—Agamemnon is referred to as Zeus and vice versa. The poem has a clear political tendenz. It glorifies the Trojans and prophesies the exaltation of their descendants, the Romans. Yet the prophetic form of the poem is a clear literary fiction—no one ever suggested that it was a real prophecy of Cassandra. The Alexandra shows a number of features characteristic of the later Sibylline oracles which are not found in the extant pagan fragments, most notably extended ex eventu prophecy, which might be taken as an attempt to cover the whole course of world history, from the earliest known events to the present time. It also emphasizes the theme of the conflict between East and West, a favorite subject of the Sibylline oracles.21 Yet it is by no means clear that this poem was the prototype of the Sibylline oracles. Ex eventu prophecy was a common device in Greek drama—Cassandra herself figured in the Oresteia of Aeschylus. Also the Erythrean (or Marpessan) Sibyl was said to have prophesied about Helen, the war between Asia and Europe, and the fall of Troy;22 therefore, most probably, an ex eventu prophecy of some length was ascribed to her. It is more likely that Lycophron, or Pseudo-Lycophron, modeled his poem on the Sibylline form than vice versa. Neither the Alexandra nor the Erythrean Sibyl divide world history into a set number of periods, in the manner typical of the later Sibylline oracles. However, such periodization of history was certainly a feature of the pagan Sibyls as can be seen by Virgil's reference to the ultima aetas, \"final age,'' of the Cumean Sibyl in the Fourth Eclogue. The periodization of history was probably a relatively late development in the Sibylline tradition (i.e. after 400 B.C.) under Persian influence.23 The Roman Sibylline oracles The most famous collection of Sibylline oracles in antiquity was the official one at Rome. Legend places the origin of these oracles in the time of Tarquinius Priscus.24 This probably indicates that the Romans had acquired a collection of oracles in Greek hexameters before the fall of the monarchy.25 These oracles were entrusted to special keepers, first two men, then ten, finally fifteen.26 They were consulted only in time of crisis for the state, and the consultation had to be authorized by a decree of the senate. No other body of literature was accorded such official authority in the Greco-Roman world. 19 The fragments of the pagan Sibyls can be found in C. Alexandre, Oracula Sibyllina. vol. 2, pp. 118-47. To these should be added the Oslo fragment published by G. Cronert, \"Oraculorum Sibyllinorum fragmentum Osloense,\" Symbolae Osloenses 6 (1928) 57-59. 20 So especially M. J.

When the temple was rebuilt in 76 B.C. oracles were collected from various Sibylline centers, especially Erythrea.27 In view of the diverse origins of these oracles it is probable that the collection was made up of short oracles rather than long continuous ones. The content of these oracles may have varied. Tibullus, 2.5.66-78, suggests that they were preoccupied with prodigies and portents. One of the main extant examples of Roman Sibyllines deals with the birth of an androgyne, who will have \"all the male characteristics and those which young girls show forth,\" and the other prescribes rituals for the occasion of the founding of the Ludi Saeculares, \"Secular Games.\"28 The use to which these oracles were put could vary too. In the early fifth century the Sibylline oracles were used as the authority for founding temples to Greek gods.29 In 173 B.C. they were consulted when the Romans were alarmed by prodigies during a war with Macedonia.30 In general they were consulted in serious crises of any kind. The function of Sibylline oracles Besides the superstitious fascination with prodigies to which they attest, Sibylline oracles (like other oracles and prophecies) seem to have functioned widely as political propaganda.31 Callisthenes wrote that both Apollo of Didyma and the Erythrean Sibyl prophesied Alexander's coming kingship.32 Nicanor, who like Callisthenes accompanied Alexander on his campaigns, is cited by Varro for the statement that the Persian Sibyl was oldest of all.33 Nicanor's interest in the Sibyl strongly suggests that there were Sibylline oracles that had a bearing on Alexander's campaign. Plutarch associates Sibylline oracles primarily with political up­heavals.34 In A.D. 12 the Emperor Augustus destroyed more than two thousand prophetic verses, including some Sibylline verses, because he found them politically subversive.35 The fact that some Sibylline books were spared by exception shows that their prestige in Rome was exceptional, but does not mean that they were devoid of political significance. It should also be remembered that the idea of a golden age, which Virgil apparently derived from the Cumean Sibyl, was closely bound to the expectation of an ideal monarch. Accordingly, it lent itself readily to political propaganda, whether or not the relevant Sibylline sources had such a purpose. All the Sibylline oracles were, of course, essentially religious. Prodigies, portents, and political crises were all related to the will of the gods and often related to matters of right worship (so, for example, the extant Roman Sibylline oracles). The pagan Sibyl spoke for Apollo, as surely as her Jewish counterpart spoke for Yahweh. The Sibylline oracles, like all oracles in antiquity, were subject to interpolation, falsifi­cation, and manipulation.36 This fact was well known in the ancient world. The Sibyls were mercilessly parodied by Aristophanes and Lucian,37 while Cicero and even Plutarch show themselves aware of the deceptions of oracle-mongers.38 Nevertheless, the prestige of these oracles was enormou's. It was doubtless because of the high esteem in which these prophecies were held that Jewish and Christian writers used the form so extensively to present their own messages.

The second collection consists of the group of manuscripts known as H. This begins with a ninth book, made up of material already found in the first collection: book 6, then a single verse, which has been placed at the beginning of book 7 since the edition of Alexandre, then 8.218-428. Then follows book 10, which is identical with book 4 of the first collection, and then books 11-14. The first two books of the second collection should be numbered 9 and 10, in sequence after the first collection. Since these books merely reduplicate material found in books 1-8 they are omitted in the editions, but the numbering of books 11-14 is retained. Hence the anomaly whereby there are no books 9 and 10 in the present collection. The chief manuscripts in each group are: H: M: Codex Ambrosianus E64 sup. (15th cent.)

The first edition was published in Basel in 1545 by Xystus Betuleius (Sixtus Birken). It was based on manuscript P and contained only the first eight books. Only in the nineteenth century were books 11-14 first published, when Angelo Mai discovered manuscripts M, Q, and V (1817-28). The first complete edition was that of C. Alexandre, who published the Prologue and books 1-8 and the fragments in 1841, and books 11-14 in 1853. The two major editions are those of A. Rzach, Oracula Sibyllina (1891) and J. Geffcken (who incorporated suggestions of K. Buresch, L. Mendelssohn, and U. Wilamowitz-Mollendorf), Die Oracula Sibyllina (1902). Opinions are divided as to which is the better edition. In general, Rzach prints emendations more readily, which gives a smoother text, but one which on occasion improves the manuscripts unduly. Geffcken is more cautious. His work is also more extensively informed by other oracular literature. The present translation is based on Geffcken's text. Occasions where other readings are followed (those of Rzach, those suggested in Geffcken's apparatus or others) are listed in the notes. Mention should be made of the contributions of A.-M. Kurfess in Sibyllinische Weissa-gungen (1951), which gives a text and German translation of books 1-11, and in several articles.40 For book 3 see V.

The dates of the individual books will be discussed in the separate introductions that follow. Books 3, 4, and 5 and the fragments were known to Clement of Alexandria at the end of the second century. These, and books 6, 7, and 8 were known to Lactantius about A.D. 300. The Prologue must be dated about A.D. 500, since it depends on the Theosophy, which contains at the end a chronicle from Adam to Caesar Zenon (474-91) and therefore was written after or during the latter's reign. The Prologue was probably composed for the first collection of Sibylline oracles as found in (j).4' Provenance The provenance of the individual books will also be discussed in the separate introductions that follow. Approximately half the collection can be ascribed to Egypt—books 3,5,11-14. Other books can be traced (with varying degrees of probability) to Syria (4, 6, 7), to Asia Minor (1/2), or only to an undetermined region of the Near East (most of SibOr 8). Historical importance Despite their wealth of historical allusions, the Sibylline oracles cannot be expected to provide reliable clironological or factual data. Some books, especially the later ones, show only the vaguest knowledge of the events they describe. The stylized presentation of the oracles is in any case not intended for factual reporting. The main historical value of the books lies in their representation of popular attitudes in the realm of politics, the legend-laden view of kings and empires, and the hopes and fears of Eastern peoples under first Greek and then, for most of the books, Roman rule. In particular they are a major source for the ideology of resistance to Rome throughout the Near East.42 Historical interest is notably lesser in the oracles that are clearly Christian (6, 7, and parts of 1, 2, and 8). Theological importance The theological importance of the Sibylline oracles lies perhaps less in their actual content than in the phenomenon which they represent—the attribution of inspired Jewish and Christian oracles to the pagan Sibyl. It is true, of course, that the Sibyl was identified as the daughter (or daughter-in-law) of Noah. However, Christian apologists explicitly emphasized that she was pagan, hoping thereby to establish her as an independent witness to the truth of the Christian faith. The logic of this position is clearly stated by Lactantius, Epitome Institutionum 68 (73): Therefore since all these things are true and certain, foretold by the harmonious prediction of all the prophets, since Trismegistus, Hystaspes and the Sibyl all uttered the same things, it is impossible to doubt that hope of all life and salvation resides in the one religion of god . . . Even before Christian writers adapted the Sibyls for their apologetic purposes, the oracles represented a remarkable attempt to find a mode of expression common to Jews (or Christians) and gentiles. As such the Jewish Sibylline oracles originated in the apologetic literature of hellenistic Judaism. The willingness to incorporate material from pagan oracles shows a significant readiness to build on the common human basis of Jews and gentiles. At least the earliest oracles in Sibylline Oracles 3 express a very positive attitude to their gentile neighbors. Later, after the destruction of the Temple, the Jewish oracles, e.g. Sibylline Oracles 5, adopt a more negative attitude but persist in using the international Sibylline form. 41 See Rzach, Pauly-Wissowa 2A, cols. 2119f. 42 See especially H.

Christ, Die Romische Weltherrschaft in der antiken Dichtung (Stuttgart, 1938)."},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"ESCHATOLOGY In content, the Sibylline oracles are dominated by eschatology. The only books that do not contain significant eschatological passages are Sibylline Oracles 11-13, and even there eschatological passages may well have been lost or displaced. The eschatology of the Jewish oracles is political in nature: It is concerned with the advent of a glorious kingdom and the transformation of the earth. As such it was a suitable medium of propaganda for the hellenistic world. A similar interest in the transformation of the earth under an ideal ruler is also found throughout the hellenistic world. The most famous example is Virgil's Fourth Eclogue, and, in general, such an earthly eschatology was well harnessed in the service of Roman propaganda.43 However, political eschatology also functioned widely in the ideology of resistance to Rome (and earlier to Greece) in the Near East. The best-known examples are the Egyptian Demotic Chronicle and Potter's Oracle, and the Persian Oracle of Hystaspes and Bahman Yasht, and of course the Jewish apocalyptic literature.44 The negative side of this eschatology is the threat of the destruction of the world, usually by fire. Here again plentiful parallels can be found in the pagan world, especially in Persian eschatology and in the Stoic concept of the ekpurdsis, \"conflagration.\"45 The idea of the conflagration is often associated with the Flood, as the two great destructions which punctuate the history of the world. (So especially SibOr 1/2 and 4.) The idea of a twofold destruction of the world is related to that of the Great Year, which is attested in some Greek writings.46 Periodization is ubiquitous in the Sibylline Oracles. Usually history is divided into ten generations, but the pattern of four kingdoms also occurs, at least in Sibylline Oracles 4. The division of history into ten periods ultimately derives from Persian religion,47 but it is also found widely in Jewish apocalyptic.48 The affinities of the Sibylline Oracles with pagan eschatology are further augmented by the incorporation of popular motifs and legends. The most famous example is the legend that Nero would return as an eschatological adversary at the head of a Parthian host, which is especially prominent in Sibylline Oracles 4, 5, and 8.49 Another example is provided by the schema of four kingdoms in Sibylline Oracles 4.50 Only in the Christian books do we find extensive interest in the fate of the individual after death. Belief in a resurrection is attested in the Jewish Sibylline Oracles 4 but only very tersely. There is some doubt as to how much of the judgment scene in Sibylline Oracles 2 is Jewish or Christian. However, the developed interest in the sufferings of the condemned is most prominently displayed in Sibylline Oracles 2, which is largely Christian, the Christian Sibylline Oracles 7, and the Christian parts of Sibylline Oracles 8. Sibylline Oracles 2 is especially characterized by its detailed interest in the fiery sufferings of the damned. Even in the Christian books, however, the paradise of the resurrected saints is an earthly one, depicted in terms of a transformation of the earth. MORAL EXHORTATION The eschatolpgy of the Sibylline Oracles usually provides a framework for exhortation. Destruction is a punishment for sins and can be avoided by certain righteous actions. The sins in which the Sibyl expresses most interest are idolatry and sexual offenses, while most of the standard ethical prohibitions of injustice, violence, etc., are also present. The polemic against idolatry is found throughout and is related to the Sibyl's repeated insistence on monotheism. All forms of sexual offenses are condemned, but special reproach is poured on homosexuality. It should be noted that the sexual polemics usually are not inspired by asceticism but rather by a concern for natural law. Only in Sibylline Oracles 2.51, in a Christian passage, is virginity commended as a virtue. While both polemic against idolatry and against homosexuality are typical features of Jewish apologetic, both can also be paralleled amply in the preachings of gentile moralists. 44 See Collins, The Sibylline Oracles, ch. 1. 45 Ibid., ch. 6. 46 Ibid., pp. lOlf. 47 Cf. n. 23 above. 48 Especially the Apocalypse of Weeks in lEn 93; 91:12-17; and HQMelch.

At this point the religious polemic of the oracles is more directly related to the political polemic that often surrounds it. Cultural significance The impact of the Sibylline oracles on the culture of the West lies mainly in their impact on the theological tradition. The oracles are quoted hundreds of times in the Church Fathers.51 They were important enough to find a place in the Emperor Constantine's \"Speech to the Saints.\"52 More significant, however, was the fact that production of Sibylline oracles continued down through the Middle Ages, and had an important influence on millenarian thinking, notably on Joachim of Fiore.53 The Tiburtine Sibyl was especially popular in the Middle Ages.54 In liturgical circles the fame of the Sibyl was perpetuated by her mention in the Dies irae of Tomas a Celano. About 1600, Orlando di Lasso composed a polyphonic arrangement of Sibylline prophecies.55 The impact of the oracles on secular culture was not great and was probably most significant in the Latin poets. In addition to Virgil's use of the Cumean Sibyl, echoes of the oracles have been found in Horace and Juvenal, although it is not certain that there was literary dependence.56 The depictions of the tortures of the damned in Sibylline Oracles 2 are echoed in a long tradition of Western writing, most notably in Dante's Inferno. However, this tradition is not specifically indebted to the Sibyl, but to the broader phenomenon of apocalyptic literature. One final area in which the influence of the Sibylline oracles should be noted is that of art. Michelangelo juxtaposed five Sibyls (Persian, Erythrean, Delphic, Cumean, and Libyan) with the Old Testament prophets in the Sistine Chapel. Raphael used four Sibyls (Cumean, Persian, Phrygian, and Tiburtine) to adorn Santa Maria della Pace in Rome. Various other painters depicted individual Sibyls.57 Eschatological motifs of the Sibylline tradition such as the Antichrist figure also appear in medieval art, but specific influence of the Sibyl is more difficult to establish in these cases. 51 See B.

It is anonymous and its exact provenance is unknown. It can be dated no earlier than the sixth century A.D. since it depends on the Theosophy, which in turn refers to Caesar Zenon (474-91) and can be no earlier than the end of the fifth century.1 The Prologue explains briefly why its author decided to collect the Sibylline Oracles. It then gives a list of ten Sibyls and recounts the legendary origin of the Sibylline books at Rome. It appeals to Lactantius for a defense of the value of the oracles. Finally it concludes by citing a few parallels in Sibylline Oracles 3.1-45, in the Sibylline fragments, and in the Pseudo-Orphic fragments. SIBYLLINE ORACLES Prologue If the hard labor involved in reading Greek literature produces great benefit for those who accomplish it, inasmuch as it is able to make those who toil at these things very learned, it befits the wise much more to busy themselves with the sacred writings—inasmuch as they 5 treat of God and the things which provide spiritual benefit— »and gain from that source a double profit throughout being able to benefit both themselves and those who meet them. For these reasons, therefore, I decided to set forth the oracles called Sibylline, which are io found scattered and confusedly read and recognized, •in one continuous and connected book, so that they might be easily reviewed by the readers and award their benefit to them, by expounding a not inconsiderable number of necessary and useful things, and making the 15 study at once more valuable and more diversified. »For they expound very clearly about Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the divine Trinity, source of life;3 about the incarnate career of our Lord and God and Savior Jesus Christ; the birth, I mean, from an unchanging virgin,\" 20 and the healings performed by him; • similarly his life-giving passion and resurrection from the dead on the third day and the judgment which will take place, and the retribution for what we all have done in this life. In addition to these things they clearly recount the things which are expounded in the Mosaic writings and the books of the prophets, about the creation 25 of the world, •the fashioning of man and the expulsion from the garden and again the new formation. In manifold ways they tell of certain past history, and equally, foretell future events, and, to speak simply, they can profit those who read them in no small way. The name \"Sibyl\" 30 \"Sibyl\" is a Latin word, interpreted as \"prophetess,\" that is to say \"seer.\" •Therefore the female seers were called by one name.

Again, in another approach to the king, she brought forward the six books and asked the same sum. She was considered of no account, so she again burned three more. Then, a third time, she approached, bringing the three that were left, and asked the same 60 price, saying that if he did not accept she would burn them also. •Then, they say, the king read them and was amazed. He gave a hundred didrachms for them and took them, and he entreated her about the others. When she answered that she did not have the equivalent of what had been burned, and could not know anything of the sort without inspiration, but that sometimes certain people had selected from various cities and regions what they considered 65 necessary and beneficial •and that a collection must be made from them, they did this also with all speed. For that which was given by God did not escape notice, though it truly lay hidden in a nook. The books of all the Sibyls were deposited in the Capitol of ancient Rome. 70 Those of the Cumean were concealed and not released to many 'since they expressed what would happen in Italy very precisely and clearly, but those of the others were known to all. Those of the Erythrean have as superscription this name by which she is called, derived from the region. But the others are not inscribed as to what belongs to whom, but are not 75 distinguished. *Now Firmianus,1 a not inconsiderable philosopher, and priest of the afore­mentioned Capitol, looking toward Christ, our eternal light, set forth in his own works what had been said by the Sibyls about the ineffable glory, and capably refuted the absurdity of 80 Greek error. His powerful commentary *was in Latin, but the Sibylline verses were set forth in Greek. That this may not appear incredible, I will provide a testimony of the aforementioned man as follows:\"1 When the Sibylline verses found with us can easily be despised by those who are knowledgeable in Greek culture, not only because they are easily available (for 85 things which are rare are thought valuable) •but also because not all the verses preserve metrical accuracy, he has a rather clear argument. This is the fault of the secretaries, who did not keep pace with the flow of speech or even were ignorant, not of the prophetess. For the memory of what had been said ceased with the inspiration. With regard to this even Plato 90 said •that they describe many great things accurately while knowing nothing of what they say.\" For my part, therefore, I will set forth as much as possible of what has been handed on in Rome by the elders.

The Jewish oracle was structured on the familiar Sibylline division of world history into ten generations. The first seven generations are preserved without inter­polation in Sibylline Oracles 1.1-323.2 Then follows a Christian passage on the incarnation and career of Christ in 1.324-400. After a transitional passage in 2.1-5 the original sequence is resumed in 2.6-33. However, a considerable portion of the Jewish oracle has been lost, as there is no reference to the eighth or ninth generations, but we are thrust immediately into the climactic events of the tenth (2.15). The remainder of Sibylline Oracles 2 (vss. 34-347) is an account of eschatological crises and the last judgment. It shows clear signs of Christian redaction but is probably not an original Christian composition. Rather the Christian Sibyllist modified the eschatological conclusion of the Jewish work by interpolations. The extent of the redactor's work is difficult to determine exactly. One passage, 2.154-76, is surely Jewish, as it culminates in the universal rule of the Hebrews (175). A number of passages are certainly Christian: 2.45-55 refers to Christ and allots a special place to virgins and martyrs.3 2.177-83 is based on the parable of the watchful servant (Mt 24:46-51; Lk 12:36-40). 2.190-92 (cf. Mark 13:17): It is possible that both Mark and Sibylline Oracles 2 could have derived this motif independently from Jewish tradition. 2.238-51: For the coming of Christ in glory with his angels cf. Matthew 25:31. The condemnation of the Hebrews in verse 250 is obviously Christian. 2.31 If.: These verses refer to the intercession of the virgin. 2.264: This verse refers to presbyters and deacons. It is part of a catalog of sins condemned at the judgment (255-83). The rest of the passage is not necessarily Christian.4 The remainder of Sibylline Oracles 2 could have been written by either a Jew or a Christian. Most scholars incline to the opinion that such passages were taken over as part of the Jewish original. In the u) group of manuscripts, Sibylline Oracles 2 contains a lengthy insert from the sayings of Pseudo-Phocylides5 (vss. 56-148). These verses contain a number of clear indications of Jewish authorship or redaction. We find references to the Old Testament in verse 82—\"God wants not sacrifice but mercy instead of sacrifice\" (cf. Hos 6:6)—and in 100f., which warns against transgressing boundaries (cf. Ex 22:5; Deut 19:14). The polemic against homosexuality (vs. 73), while less conclusive, is also typically Jewish. Nothing in these verses is necessarily Christian. However, they form part of the longer passage on the contest for entry into heaven, of which at least verses 45-55 are Christian. While Jewish in authorship, the verses may have been first inserted into the Sibylline Oracles by a Christian. 1 The main discussions of these books are those of Geffcken, Komposition und Entstehungszeh, pp. 47-53; Rzach, Pauly-Wissowa 2A, cols. 2146-52; A. Kurfess, \"Oracula Sibyllina I/II,\" ZNW 40 (1941) 151-65. 2 Geffcken, Komposition und Entstehungszeit, p. 48, argued that SibOr 1 175-79 and 193-96 were Christian interpolations based on SibOr 8.184-87 and 7.7, 9-12 respectively, but he has been convincingly refuted by Kurfess, Z/VW40(1941) 151-60. 3 For the association of martyrdom and virginity in the early Church see H. von Campenhausen, Die Idee des Martyriums in der alten Kirche (Gottingen, 1964) pp. 139f. They are already the two chief distinguishing marks of the elect in Rev. 4 Geffcken inclined to Christian authorship because of the parallels with such Christian writings as ApPaul {Komposition und Entstehungszeit, p. 52). 5 See especially A. Kurfess, \"Das Mahngedicht des sogenannten Phokylides im zweiten Buch der Oracula Sibyllina,\" ZNW 38 (1939) 171-81. For a more complete study of Ps-Phoc see the work of P. van der Horst in this volume, and in The Sentences of Pseudo-Phocylides with Introduction and Commentary (SVTP 4; Leiden, 1978)."},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"Date Such evidence as we have for the date of Sibylline Oracles 1 and 2 is scanty and less than conclusive. There are two major opinions: 1. Geffcken dated both Jewish and Christian stages in the third century A.D.6 For the Jewish stage he advanced three arguments: a. The Sibyl and Noah are depicted on coins from Apamea-Kibotos in the third century. However, this proves only that the association of the Sibyl and Noah was known in Asia Minor in the third century. It does not prove that it was not known earlier. The Sibyl and Noah were associated already in Sibylline Oracles 3.827, in the second century B.C. This criterion must be considered inconclusive. b. Certain metrical peculiarities in the book find their closest analogies in book 12, which dates from the third century. However, given the metrical irregularity of the entire Sibylline corpus,7 no firm conclusion can be based on this. c. Geffcken's third argument is the author's poor style. This again cannot be said to point to any particular date. For the Christian redaction Geffcken posits dependence on Sibylline Oracles 8, which was written in the late second century. This dependence, as we shall see, is open to question. 2. The second major position on the date of this book is that of Kurfess.8 Kurfess dates the Jewish stage about the turn of the era and the Christian stage before A.D. 150. For the Jewish stage the latest possible date is supplied by the comparison with Sibylline Oracles 7, which is usually dated in the mid-second century A.D. Now Sibylline Oracles 7.7, 9-12 correspond exactly to Sibylline Oracles 1.183, 193-96. Since these verses are well integrated in their context in book 1 and are part of a fragmentary isolated oracle in book 7 we must assume the priority of Sibylline Oracles l.9 The date of Sibylline Oracles 7, however, is by no means certain, but since it is quoted by Lactantius we can at least take the mid-third century A.D. as the latest possible date for Sibylline Oracles 1. The earliest possible date for the Jewish stage is supplied by the fact that Rome is the only power singled out for destruction in the tenth generation (SibOr 2.18). Rome was prominent in Asia Minor from the beginning of the second century B.C., but the fact that it is the only power mentioned suggests that the oracle was written at a time when Roman power in the Near East was consolidated, therefore no earlier than 30 B.C. This gives a period from 30 B.C. to A.D. 250 within which the oracle could have been written. This period can probably be limited further. The Jewish stage contains no reference to the destruction of Jerusalem, and there is no reference in book 2 to the favorite Sibylline theme of Nero's return. There is a reference to the fall of Jerusalem in 1.393-96. However, it is passed over briefly without any recrimination against Rome, and there is no reference to it in the context of the tenth generation. In fact, the only offense mentioned in connection with the destruction of Rome is idolatry (2.17). It is unlikely that a Jew writing after A.D. 70, who is at all concerned with historical events, would pass over the destruction of the Temple so lightly. Therefore the consensus of scholars that 1.387-400 is part of the Christian redaction is probably right. These verses are the only part of the Christian addition to book 1 that do not deal with the career of Christ. Presumably they were added to bring the oracle up to date. If this is so, the original Jewish oracle probably carried its review of history no later than the time of Augustus, and so the dating suggested by Kurfess, about the turn of the era, is most likely correct. The earliest possible date for the Christian redaction is the fall of Jerusalem. The latest possible date is more difficult to find. Kurfess argues that the book must be earlier than Sibylline Oracles 7 and 8.10 There is in fact no reason to posit literary dependence between 6 Geffcken, Komposition und Entstehungszeit, p. 49. 7 See A. Rzach, Metrische Studien zu den Sibyllinischen Orakel (Wien, 1892); Bousset, \"Sibyllen und Sibyllinische Bucher,\" p. 274. 8 Kurfess, ZNW 40 (1941) 151-65. A similar position was maintained by H. Dechent, Uber das I, 2 und 11 Buch der Sibyllinische Weissagungen (Frankfurt am Main: diss., Jena, 1873). 9 Contra Geffcken, Komposition und Entstehungszeit, p. 48. 10 Kurfess, ZNW 40 (1941) 165."},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"the Christian redaction of books 1 and 2 and book 7, but the parallels between books 2 and 8 are too numerous for mere coincidence: 2.325-27, 329 cf. 8.424-27 The direction of the influence is disputed. Geffcken presumes the priority of book 8, Kurfess of book 2. There is no clear conclusive evidence either way. The contention of Kurfess that the verses are more likely to be original in the sustained eschatological treatise of book 2 seems to carry the greater probability. In any case, the highly developed eschatology of the book is presumably later than the Revelation of John. Since no other historical event is mentioned after the destruction of Jerusalem, the Christian redaction should probably be dated no later than A.D. 150.\" Provenance At least the Jewish substratum of Sibylline Oracles 1 and 2 comes from Phrygia.12 This is indicated by 1.196-98, where Phrygia is said to be the first land to emerge after the Flood, and to become the nurse of restored humanity in the sixth generation. Also, in 1.26If., Ararat is located in Phrygia. The prominence thus given to Phrygia is the only indication of local provenance. There is nothing to indicate the provenance of the Christian redaction. The speech of Noah in 1.150-98 underlines the hortatory function of the book, but there is nothing to indicate its actual setting in life. Historical importance If the early dating proposed for both Jewish and Christian stages of Sibylline Oracles 1 and 2 is correct, then these books acquire considerable historical importance. The Jewish substratum is the only extensive document we have from the Judaism of Asia Minor in this period. The historical importance of the Jewish stage is somewhat diminished by the doubt as to whether much of book 2 is Jewish or Christian, but it remains a substantial source for an area of Judaism of which little is known. The book is remarkable among the Sibylline Oracles for its lack of reference to particular cities and events (though such references may have been part of the lost account of the eighth and ninth generations). Accordingly it is more difficult to relate to a specific historical situation than the other Sibylline books. Theological importance The main theological interest of Sibylline Oracles 1 lies in its use of the schematization of history into ten generations. Such a schematization is presupposed in several Sibylline Oracles, including those of the Cumean Sibyl of Virgil's Fourth Eclogue,13 but it is most elaborately developed here and in Sibylline Oracles 4.'4 In Sibylline Oracles 1 it is combined with the idea of the Great Year. The first five generations end with a destruction by flood; the second five with a destruction by fire.15 The schematization of history is used by the Sibyllist as a framework for exhortation. The \" Ibid., p. 165. 12 Geffcken, Komposition und Entstehungszeit, p. 50. 13 See especially the commentary of Servius, who identified the \"last age\" of Virgil's Sibyl as the tenth, Servii Grammatici qui feruntur in Vergilia Bucolica et Georgica commentarii (ed.

Flusser, \"The Four Empires in the Fourth Sibyl and in the Book of Daniel,\" Israel Oriental Studies 2 (1972) 163. 14 On the schematization of world history in SibOr 1 see A.

Such a doctrine of two world cycles seems to be implicit in Hesiod, and is explicit in Heraclitus and Plato (see esp. Politicus 273 b-c). For such a belief in Judaism see especially Vita 49; Josephus, Ant 1.2.3 (70f.). See further I. Chaine, \"Cosmogonie aquatique et conflagration finale d'apres la secunda Petri,\" RB 46 (1937) 207-16.

So in Sibylline Oracles 1.150-70 and again in 174-98 Noah preaches to his contemporaries about the sins which lead to destruction and the ways to avoid it. The sins mentioned are obvious ones—violence (155-57, 176), deceit (177), adultery and slander (178), and lack of reverence for God (179). The remedy is simple— repentance and supplication (167-69). Because of the Christian redaction it is not clear whether humanity is given a similar warning before the final destruction by fire. ESCHATOLOGY It is also uncertain how far the eschatological rewards and punishments of Sibylline Oracles 2 can be ascribed to the Jewish oracle. At least 2.154-76 appears to be Jewish. This passage describes the eschatological dominion of the Hebrews \"as of old,\" therefore presumably an earthly kingdom of the historical order. The description of the resurrection in 2.214-37 is quite possibly Jewish. The four archangels, Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Uriel, are familiar from Jewish sources.16 The reference to the Giants (2.23If.) is an explicit point of contact with book 1. The actual description of resurrection, with its very physical conjunction of bones and flesh, recalls Ezekiel 37. The natural sequel to such a resurrection is not a heavenly state but rather a transformation of the earth, which we find in 2.317-29. The punishment of the wicked by fire (2.285-310) is of course attested as early as Isaiah 66:24 and was common in intertes­tamental Judaism,17 so it too could have formed part of the Jewish work. THE CHRISTIAN REDACTION The Christian redactor was interested primarily in the eschatology of the book. His impatience with the earlier history is shown by his omission of the eighth and ninth generations. The redactor also makes use of the end-time for a hortatory purpose. The ethical instruction is presented in two passages: 1. The contest for entry into heaven (2.39-153) provides a framework for exhortation. Much of this is taken up (at least in the u> MSS) by the sayings of Pseudo-Phocylides, which consist of the rather banal commonalities of Greek and Near Eastern folk wisdom with a few distinctly Jewish verses.18 Of course the inclusion of this material is significant as an indication of the Sibyl's willingness to find common ground for gentile, Jew, and Christian. The most significant indication of the values of the Christian redactor, however, is found in 2.46-48, where two classes are singled out for special honor—martyrs and virgins. This combination is quite typical of early Christianity.19 Other virtues specifically mentioned are justice, monotheistic worship, and marital fidelity (2.49-52). 2. The second passage important for the ethics of the redactor is found in 2.255-83.2(1 This is a catalog of sins for which people are condemned. In addition to the usual condemnation of idolatry, violence, injustice, etc., special emphasis is laid on the treatment of widows and orphans (2.270-73) and of parents (273-76) and on sexual offenses and abortion (279-82). Much more emphasis is laid on the punishment of the bad than on the reward of the good. The plight of the damned in the fiery underworld is described in lurid detail in 2.285-310. The detailed interest in punishment after death and the use of the wisdom teachings of Pseudo-Phocylides reflect an interest in the judgment of the individual rather than a political notion of the end-time focused on the overthrow of Rome. Yet the Christian redaction retains much of the Jewish oracle, and salvation is ultimately presented as a transformation of the earth rather than as a heavenly state. Neither the Jewish nor the Christian stage attaches any significance to a distinction between soul and body. One final feature of the eschatology is worthy of note. According to 2.330-38 the blessed 16 E.g. 1 En 9:1; ApMos 40:1. See Y. Yadin, The Scroll of the War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness (Oxford, 1962) p. 238. 17 E.g. 1QS 2:8; lEn 21.

Cf. n. 4 above."},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"can obtain the release of some condemned souls by intercession. In a gloss in the u) manuscripts this doctrine is condemned and attributed to Origen. Relation to other literature The most conspicuous parallels in these books to a biblical text are found in the account of the Flood, which draws heavily on the Septuagint.2' However, even here the Sibyllist is not solely dependent on biblical tradition, since some details of the story correspond, not with Genesis, but with Babylonian myth.22 Rzach suggests that the Sibyl may have been influenced by Berossus, who shows a similar sweep of cosmic history from creation to the end. Various parallels are found in the Jewish stratum of the work to the intertestamental writings of Judaism. The most significant perhaps are the parallels to the Watchers in 1 Enoch.23 Sibylline Oracles 1 and 2 is more obviously related to the rest of the Sibylline literature, especially book 4, in its organization of history into periods, and to book 8 in the eschatology of the Christian redaction. A conspicuous feature of Sibylline Oracles 1 and 2 is the extent of the influence of Hesiod, especially the Works and Days.24 In book 1 each half of world history is divided into four declining ages, followed by a fifth in which the world is actually destroyed. The sixth generation, the first after the Flood, is said to be golden (1.284). The schema, and several verbal parallels, reflects direct use of Hesiod by the Sibyl. Finally the eschatology of Sibylline Oracles 2, with its heavy concentration on the punishments of hell, is paralleled in late Jewish and early Christian apocalypses— especially the apocalypses of Zephaniah, Peter, and Paul.25 The idea of punishment in Orphism (e.g. Plato, Republic 10.614-21, Gorgias 523) and some Greek influence is probable in book 2. However, the most prominent feature of the Sibylline writing is the fiery character of the netherworld. The destruction of the world by fire, and the attendant destruction of sinners, was very prominent in the Persian notion of the end and throughout the Sibylline tradition. Kurfess has emphasised the parallels between Sibylline Oracles 2 and the Oracle of Hystaspes.26 However, the distinctive character of the eschatology of Sibylline Oracles 2 is a fiery hell as an eternal place of punishment. This concept appears to be a Jewish development. The Watchers in 1 Enoch are consigned to a fiery abyss, and the sinners in the judgment share a like fate (e.g. lEn 90:23f.).

The idea of a river ordeal is ancient in the Near East and underlies many passages in the Psalms (Ps 69:2f.; Ps 18:5; Jonah 2:4,6).

West, Sacred Books of the East, vol. 5, p. 125f.): \"Afterwards the fire and halo melt the Shatvairo in the hills and mountains, and it remains on this earth like a river.

The destruction of the wicked by fire is prominent in Persian belief about the end, but it is not an eternal punishment in the netherworld. The idea of a fiery hell seems to be a Jewish development. It is suggested by Isa 66:24, but that passage does not imply that the wicked will be alive to feel the flames.

In fact we may distinguish three stages in the book:4 1. The main corpus: verses 97-349 and 489-829. 2. Oracles against various nations: 350-488. 3. Verses 1-96, which probably constitute the conclusion of a different book. One verse (776) must be regarded as a Christian interpolation.5 1. The main corpus In the main corpus of the book five oracles may be distinguished: (1) 97-161; (2) 162-95; (3) 196-294; (4) 545-656; (5) 657-808. The first of these, 97-161, stands apart from the rest of the book. It contains: (a) the fall of the tower of Babylon (97-104); (b) a euhemeristic account of the war of the Titans against Cronos and his sons (105-55); (c) a list of world empires (156-61). The description of the fall of the tower has been widely thought to be a fragment from a collection of oracles of a Babylonian sibyl, perhaps influenced by Berossus, but this theory has been soundly refuted by Nikiprowetzky.6 There is nothing in the Sibylline account that could not be developed from Genesis. The euhemeristic account of Greek mythology is exceptional in Sibylline Oracles 3, and may possibly be borrowed from a non-Jewish source but, on the other hand, is not incompatible with anything else in the book. The list of world empires is, of course, a typical Sibylline feature. Sibylline Oracles 3.156-61 lists eight kingdoms, but we should assume that the kingdom of Cronos is presupposed as a first kingdom and that a tenth, final kingdom is expected. The passage therefore conforms to the typical Sibylline division of history into ten periods.7 The entire section 3.97-161 serves as an introduction to the remaining portions of the book. It introduces the theme of world kingship and shows that it was a cause of strife from the beginning. It therefore provides a context for the oracles about the end-time that are in the rest of the book. The other four sections present a recurring pattern: (a) sin, usually idolatry, which leads to (b) disaster and tribulation, which is terminated by (c) the advent of a king or kingdom. The third section of the book (196-294) differs from the others insofar as it is not about the end-time but describes the Babylonian exile and restoration. In the second section (162-95) the king who terminates the period of disasters is identified as the seventh king of Egypt from the Greek dynasty and in the fourth section (545-656) as a king \"from the sun,\" which should be taken as a reference to an Egyptian king.8 In the final section the reference is to a kingdom raised up by God (767). DATE The date of the main corpus is fixed by three references to the seventh king of Egypt in 1 See especially the studies of A. Peretti, La Sibilla Babilonese nella propaganda ellenistica; V. Nikiprowetzky, La Troisiime Sibylle; J. J. Collins, The Sibylline Oracles of Egyptian Judaism, pp. 21-71. 2 See Collins, The Sibylline Oracles, p. 21.

While seven was a sacred number, thus perhaps describing the seventh king as the ideal king, the number could not have been introduced, with any credibility, later than the reign of the seventh Ptolemy.9 The identification of the seventh Ptolemy is not, however, unambiguous. There are three possible identifications: Ptolemy 6, Philometor, who reigned from 180-64, 163-45; Ptolemy 7, Neos Philopator, 145-44; Ptolemy 8, Physcon (also called Euergetes II), 170-64, 164-63, and 144-17. Philometor and Physcon were co-regents from 170-64 and Physcon replaced Philometor for a time in 164-63. The enumeration of the kings is further confused by the possibility that Alexander was counted as the first king. Finally, the Sibylline oracle may have been written either during the reign of the seventh king or during that of the sixth, when the seventh was proximately expected. Accordingly, the reference to the seventh king could conceivably point to a date at any time in the second century B.C. down to the death of Physcon in 117 B.C. However, this period can be further defined. The prominence of the Romans in verses 175-90 requires a date after the battle of Magnesia in 190 B.C. and probably after Rome's intervention in the affairs of Egypt in the time of Antiochus Epiphanes. This already brings us down to the time of Philometor, and so the oracles were most probably written at some time during the reigns of Philometor and Physcon. In view of the remarkable confidence which the Sibyl places in the Ptolemaic kings and of the celebrated relations of Philometor with the Jews,10 it is most probable that the Sibyl wrote in the period 163-45 B.C.\" PROVENANCE There is no doubt that Sibylline Oracles 3 was written in Egypt. This is clear from the double reference to Egypt in 155-61, in which the kingdom of Macedonia is followed by a kingdom of Egypt, and from the repeated references to the seventh king of Egypt. Within Egypt the work has been usually located in Alexandrian Judaism. However, there is reason to believe that it was written in the circles associated with the priest Onias, founder of the temple at Leontopolis. The strongest clue to the provenance of Sibylline Oracles 3 is the enthusiastic endorsement of a Ptolemaic king as a savior figure who will put an end to war and usher in a reign of peace. The emphasis on warfare and politics throughout the book contrasts sharply with the spiritualizing tendencies usually associated with Alexandrian Judaism. However, it seems entirely appropriate for a follower of Onias, who was a prominent general in the army of Philometor.12 The hailing of a Ptolemaic king (either Philometor or his expected heir) as a virtual messiah points also to the circles of Onias, who benefited most obviously from the 9 The only dissenter from this view is Nikiprowetzky (La Troisieme Sibylle, p. 215). He identifies the seventh king as Queen Cleopatra VII (!). It is very doubtful whether the numeral 7 was associated with Cleopatra in antiquity. In any case, whatever the queen's manly qualities, history leaves little possibility that she could have been mistaken for a king. 10 Josephus, Apion 2:49, claims that Philometor entrusted his whole realm to the Jews. While this is certainly an exaggeration there must have been some basis for the statement. The Jewish temple at Leontopolis was built under Philometor (War 1.1.1 and 7.10.2 [432]; Am 12.9.7 [382f.] and 13.3.1 [62f.]). Also, the Jewish philosopher Aristobulus was said to have been teacher of Philometor or at least to have dedicated a book to him (2Mac 1:10). See J.J. Collins, 4'The Provenance of the Third Sibylline Oracle,\" Bulletin of the Institute of Jewish Studies 2 (1974) 8f. 11 Nikiprowetzky, La Troisiime Sibylle, pp. 209-12, argues for a lst-cent. date mainly on the basis of the prominence of Rome in vss. 175-90. However, that oracle makes special note of Roman outrages in Macedonia (190). This reference points not to a lst-cent. date but rather to the Macedonian wars in the 2nd cent. B.C. Peretti, La Sibilla Babilonese, p. 190, regarded the references to the Romans as a late insertion. J. Nolland, \"Sib Or III. 265-94, An Early Maccabean Messianic Oracle,\" JTS 30 (1979) 158-67, argues that vss. 282-94, which ostensibly refer to the restoration under Cyrus, refer typologically to the author's own day, which he identifies as the time when the Temple was profaned by Antiochus Epiphanes. Since he takes the oracle to refer to a Davidic messiah, and since it does not refer to the Maccabees, he dates it \"prior to significant Maccabean success.\" However, even if we accept the typological interpretation of the passage, which is not certain, the only individual king mentioned in the passage is Cyrus. Typologically, the passage suggests that a gentile king will fill the messianic role. Silence on the Maccabees may be due to a lack of sympathy with them, and the Maccabean restoration of the Temple may not have been recognized. 12 Josephus, Apion 2.149."},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"patronage of Philometor, rather than to any academic circles in Alexandria. Further, the third Sibyl displays an interest in the Temple which is unparalleled in any document from Egyptian Judaism13—see verses 286-94, 564-67, 657-59, 715-18. This interest in the Temple does not require priestly origins but is obviously highly compatible with the attitudes of a follower of Onias: The Temple to which Sibylline Oracles 3 refers is certainly the Jerusalem Temple. This fact, and the lack of any explicit reference to Leontopolis, might be thought to constitute an objection to provenance in the circles of Onias. The objection, however, is not a serious one, and rather provides a closer indication of the date of the work. The temple of Leontopolis was not built until several years after Onias arrived in Egypt.14 The land for the temple was probably given in recognition of services over a number of years.15 Sibylline Oracles 3 was probably written in this period before the new temple was built—therefore approximately 160-50 B.C. We should note moreover that there is no reason why the community of Leontopolis should not have continued to look on Jerusalem as the ideal temple even after the new shrine was built, just as the Qumran community continued to look to the Jerusalem Temple after they had severed connections with it.16 HISTORICAL IMPORTANCE The main historical interest of Sibylline Oracles 3 lies in its attestation of a Jewish community that could hail a Ptolemaic king as a savior figure or Messiah. The transformation at the end-time is dated to the reign of the seventh king of Egypt in verses 193, 318, and 608, but the most striking instance is found in verses 652-56. There we read that a \"king from the sun\" will bring peace to the earth by the counsels of God. The phrase \"a king from the sun\" is also found in the closely contemporary Egyptian Potter's Oracle,17 where it clearly refers to an Egyptian king. In Egyptian mythology the king was thought to be an incarnation of the sun-god.18 There is nothing to indicate that Sibylline Oracles 3 endorsed the Egyptian mythology, but in view of the frequency with which the Egyptian kings (including the Ptolemies) were associated with the sun,19 verse 652 must be taken as a reference to an Egyptian king. This Egyptian \"king from the sun\" cannot be held distinct from the \"seventh king\" of the Greeks in whose reign war will cease. In short, Sibylline Oracles 3 looked upon the seventh Ptolemaic king, whether present or still future, as a messiah sent by God. Such veneration of a gentile king was not without precedent in Jewish tradition but strikingly recalls how Deutero-Isaiah hailed Cyrus as messiah (Isa 45:1). A work that hails a Ptolemaic king as a savior figure must be presumed to have at least in part a propagandistic purpose. The work might at least hope to ingratiate the royal house and show that Jews and gentiles could share a common hope. 13 Collins, The Sibylline Oracles, pp. 48f.; Bulletin of the Institute of Jewish Studies, pp. llf. A. Momigliano, \"La portata storica dei vaticini sul settimo re nel terzo libro degli Oracoli Sibillini,\" in Forma futuri: Studi in onore del Cardinale Michele Pellegrino (Turin, 1975) pp. 1077-84, argues that SibOr 3 was writen to assert the unity of Egyptian and Palestinian Judaism after the Maccabean revolt. He sees a reference to the revolt in vss. 194f.: \"And then the people of the great God will again be strong.\" This allusion, however, is far too vague and should be understood as future hope, not accomplished fact. There is nothing in SibOr 3 that indicates sympathy with the Maccabees. The emphasis placed on a king of Egypt is quite alien to the nationalism of the Maccabees, but is strikingly compatible with the politics of the Oniads both before and after the revolt. 14 See M. Delcor, \"Le Temple d'Onias en Egypte,\" RB 125 (1968) 196. 15 V.

Bergman, Ich bin Isis (Uppsala, Sweden, 1969) p. 67. 19 In a hieroglyphic stele dated to 311 B.C., Alexander IV is described as \"chosen of the sun, son of the sun.\" On the Rosetta Stone, Ptolemy V Euergetes is described as the son of the sun \"to whom the sun has given victory.\" See E.

Momigliano, Forma futuri: Studi in onore del Cardinale Michele Pellegrino, pp. 1077-84, suggests that in SibOr 3, as in the Potter's Oracle, the king from the sun is anti-Ptolemaic. This view ignores the association of sun mythology with the Ptolemies and makes a strained distinction between the seventh king and the king from the sun. Momigliano's thesis that the oracle was written in support of the Maccabean revolt suffers from the lack of any clear reference to the Maccabees."},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"THEOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE As usual in the Sibylline Oracles the concept of the end-time provides a framework for exhortation. Certain types of action lead to destruction, certain others to deliverance. In section 2 (vss. 162-95) the main cause of destruction is the misconduct of the Romans, especially homosexuality (185-86) and covetousness (189). In section 3 (196-294) the Babylonian exile is a direct punishment for idolatry (275-85). In the fourth section (545-656) the Greeks are endangered because of idolatry (545-55) but can avoid disaster by sending sacrifices to the Temple (565). They are contrasted with the Jews, who honor the Temple with sacrifices and avoid idolatry (575-90), adultery and homosexuality (595-600). Again in verses 601-7 the gentiles are said to be in danger because of homosexuality and idolatry. Finally in the last section (657-808) the Sibyl again appeals to the Greeks to refrain from idolatry, adultery, and homosexuality (762-66) and prophesies that people from all countries will send gifts to the Temple (715-19, 772f.). The main message of Sibylline Oracles 3 then would seem to lie in the denunciation of idolatry and sexual abuses and in the advocacy of the Temple. This message is explicitly directed to the gentiles but no doubt was intended for Jewish readers as well. One brief passage (vss. 591-95) gives us a glimpse of some of the more specific practices of this branch of Judaism. They raise their arms in prayer to God at dawn and take ritual baths (or wash their hands ritually).20 Despite occasional attempts to relate these practices to the Essenes or Pythagoreans, the evidence is not specific enough to warrant the identification of a sect.21 The eschatology of Sibylline Oracles 3 centers on the expectation of an ideal king or kingdom. The enemies of that king will be killed or subdued by oaths (654). The state of salvation is envisaged in political earthly terms, as a transformation of the earth and exaltation of the Temple (701-61, 767-95). Before this ideal king comes there will be a period of chaotic tribulation. In verses 611-15 this is brought about in part by a king from Asia, the traditional threat to Egypt.22 In verses 660-701 a final period of confusion is caused by the attack of the gentiles on Jerusalem. They are destroyed directly by God by various means, including brimstone from heaven. RELATION TO OTHER BOOKS The ethics of Sibylline Oracles 3 are commonplace in the Judaism of the hellenistic age. Similar polemics against sexual aberrations are found, for example, in Epistle of Aristeas 152, Philo, Abr 135; SpecLeg 2.50, 3.37; and Romans 1:26. Polemic against idolatry is ubiquitous in Jewish writing after Deutero-Isaiah. The polemic agamst astrology and Chaldean divination in verses 220-28 is paralleled in Jubilees 12:16-18 and 1 Enoch 80:7. The eschatology of Sibylline Oracles 3 finds its closest parallels in pre-exilic Jewish literature such as Isaiah and the Psalms. The assault of the gentiles on Jerusalem is especially reminiscent of Psalms 2 and 48, while the transformation of the earth in verses 785-95 is obviously dependent on Isaiah 11. The idea of the pilgrimage of the gentiles at the end-time to Jerusalem is found in Isaiah 2:1-4, Micah 4:1-4, and Zechariah 14:16-21. The expectation of an ideal king, followed by a transformation of the earth, is also paralleled in a number of contemporary gentile writings, most notably the Potter's Oracle and (somewhat later) Virgil's Fourth Eclogue. Sibylline Oracles 3 shows no sign of a belief in resurrection or afterlife typical of the apocalyptic writings of the period. 2. Sibylline Oracles 3.350-488. Oracles Against Various Nations Verses 350-480 consist of four diverse oracles that lack any ethical exhortation and are included because of the general Sibylline interest in political oracles. The four oracles are vss. 350-80, 381-87, 388-400, 401-88. 20 According to a quotation in Clement (Protrepticus 6:70) they purify their flesh by washing. According to the MSS they wash their hands. 21 See the discussion by Nikiprowetzky, La Troisieme Sibylle, pp. 238-59. Nikiprowetzky errs in trying to eliminate the differences between SibOr 3 and SibOr 4. 22 See Collins, The Sibylline Oracles, pp. 39f. Peretti, La Sibilla Babilonese, mistakenly takes the king from Asia as a messianic figure."},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"VERSES 350-80 This oracle is distinguished from the rest of the book by the fact that the antithetical powers are Rome and Asia, whereas the rest of the book deals with internal Egyptian matters and presents a contrast between Rome and Egypt or Asia and Egypt. The theme of the oracle is the vengeance of Asia on Rome, which will be exacted by a lady, a despoina. The lady in question should be identified as Cleopatra, representing also Egypt, of which she was queen, and the goddess Isis, whom she claimed to incarnate.23 The only serious alternative to this interpretation, which has been put forward,24 is that the oracle was part of the propaganda of Mithridates (in which case the despoina must be identified as Asia). However, one detail of the oracle renders this interpretation highly unlikely. Not only is the destruction of Rome envisaged but also its restoration (361) and an ultimate state of harmony (375). Such an idea of reconciliation had no place in Mithridates' war to the death against Rome.25 Cleopatra's ambition, however, was to rule over the Roman Empire, not to destroy it. She stood in the tradition of Alexander—her son by Antony was called Alexander Helios—and therefore in a tradition which envisaged the unity of East and West.26 Date and provenance This oracle must have been written shortly before the battle of Actium (31 B.C.) and, presumably, in Egypt. There is nothing specifically Jewish in these verses but, whether they were composed by a Jew or only taken over, we must note that they are quite in harmony with the enthusiasm for the Ptolemaic house noted in the main corpus of Sibylline Oracles 3. It is true that relations between Cleopatra and the Jews were not always cordial. The queen wanted to restore Egyptian rule in Palestine, a desire naturally resented by Herod.27 There is also a report, of less than complete reliability, that she withheld corn from the Jews in time of famine.28 However, there is no reason to suppose that Cleopatra was at odds with all Jews or that some of them could not have espoused her cause, especially those who had a tradition of loyalty to the Ptolemaic house. Significance and relation to other literature The importance of this oracle lies in its attestation of Near Eastern anti-Roman propaganda. The fact that at least one strand of Egyptian Judaism could espouse such an oracle is also of interest. Two traditions are important for understanding this oracle. The first is an old tradition, common to the entire eastern Mediterranean, which saw world history as an ongoing conflict between East and West, Asia and Europe. This theme is found in Herodotus 1.4 and is used in the Alexandra of Lycophron, in oracles preserved by Phlegon which are said to have been uttered at the time of the battle of Magnesia,29 and above all in the Oracle of Hystaspes.30 It also finds mention in Tacitus' account of the Jewish war.31 Significantly, Cleopatra's campaign against Rome was presented as a world conflict between East and West not only by the Roman poets Virgil (Aeneid 8.685f.) and Florus (2.21) but most explicitly by the Egyptian Jew Philo (Legatio ad Gaium 144).32 The second tradition is native to Egypt. According to Egyptian tradition every queen was an incarnation of Isis. This claim was made explicitly by Cleopatra.33 Many aspects of the 23 Collins, The Sibylline Oracles, pp. 57-71. 24 So Geffcken, Komposition und Entstehungszeit, p. 8; Lanchester, \"The Sibylline Oracles,\" p. 372; Peretti, La Sibil la Babilonese, p. 340. 25 See H.

VERSES 381-87 These verses are ascribed to a Persian Sibyl by Geffcken because they predict the fall of the Macedonian kingdom after the conquest of Babylon.35 They are ascribed to a Babylonian Sibyl by S. K. Eddy for exactly the same reason.36 At least the existence of a Persian Sibyl is attested.37 (The existence of the Babylonian Sibyl is more dubious.) However, the evidence for attributing this oracle to a specific situation is simply inadequate. It could have been written by anyone hostile to the Macedonians at any time after the fall of Babylon to Alexander. VERSES 388-400 This oracle is again directed against the Macedonians. The man, clad in purple, who will come to Asia is certainly Alexander.38 This oracle was updated by a Jewish Sibyllist who added references to the root with ten horns and the horn growing on the side, clearly alluding to Daniel 7. Since all the oracles in verses 350-488 were apparently late additions to Sibylline Oracles 3, the reference to Daniel is of no help in dating the book. The oracle stands as an isolated piece of anti-hellenistic propaganda. VERSES 401-88 These verses have been plausibly attributed by Geffcken to the Erythrean Sibyl.39 Varro tells us that the Sibyl of Erythrea prophesied that Troy would fall and that Homer would write falsehoods,40 and Pausanias (10.2.2) says that she sang of Helen and the Trojan War. These are precisely the themes we find in Sibylline Oracles 3.401-32. Further, this is the only section of Sibylline Oracles 3 where there are regular references to places in Asia Minor. The only indications of date are in verses 464-69, where there is clear reference to a Roman civil war, and in 470, which speaks of a man from Italy who goes to Asia. The man from Italy has been identified by Lanchester as Sulla.41 This oracle might well be associated with the Mithridatic wars. The oracles in verses 350-480 show no ethical interest. They were presumably inserted to bring Sibylline Oracles 3 up to date and to add to its Sibylline flavor by increasing the prophecies of destruction against particular cities. 3. The oracles in Sibylline Oracles 3.1-96 The first ninety-six verses of Sibylline Oracles 3 are dissociated from the rest of the book by all scholars except Nikiprowetzky.42 Even the manuscripts contain indications that these verses are part of a separate work. In most manuscripts the present Sibylline Oracles 3 is introduced as an extract from the \"second book, about God.\" Before verse 93 three manuscripts in the class i|> insert the note \"seek here the remnants of the second book and the beginning of the third.\"43 Sibylline Oracles 3.1-45 are quite different from anything else 34 Tarn, \"Alexander Helios,\" pp. 139-48; Collins, The Sibylline Oracles, p. 62. 35 Geffcken, Komposition und Entstehungszeit, p. 13. 36 Eddy, The King Is Dead, p. 127. 37 Varro, cited by Lactantius, Divlnst 1.6. 38 So Eddy, The King Is Dead, p. 12, following Bousset, \"Die Beziehungen der altesten judischen Sibylle zur Chaldaischen,\" ZNW 3 (1902) 23-50.

Kurfess has suggested that the first three fragments with verses 1-92 make up the original second book of the collection.44 This suggestion is attractive insofar as verses 46-92 would then form the conclusion of a book, whereas they now stand rather incongruously at the beginning of a book.45 There must, however, be some doubt as to whether verses 46-96 really belong with verses 1-45 at all. Also verses 63-74 must be considered later than the rest of the material. DATE Verses 1-45 and the fragments in Theophilus are direct hortatory material that are concerned chiefly with monotheism and polemic against idolatry. This material finds its closest parallels in the Jewish Orphic fragments, which probably date to the second century B.C.,46 and also in Philo. In themselves, they could have been composed at any time in the late hellenistic or early Roman periods. If we may assume that they originally formed a unit with any part of verses 46-92 we can fix their date more precisely. Verses 46-92 consist of three oracles: 46-62, 63-74, 75-92. Verses 46-62 must be dated shortly after the battle of Actium. Verse 52 refers to the second triumvirate.47 Verses 46f. presuppose that Rome has already gained control over Egypt. Verses 75-92 were also written shortly after the battle of Actium. This oracle is dominated by the figure of Cleopatra, the \"widow\" of verse 77.48 Here she is no longer the glorious queen of Sibylline Oracles 3.350-80 but the widow who has brought disaster upon the world. The oracle reflects the disillusionment of the Egyptian Jews after the defeat of Cleopatra. Verses 63-74 relate the coming of Beliar, the signs he will perform, and his eventual destruction. He is said to come \"ek Sebastendn.\" Two main interpretations of this phrase have been proposed: a. It means: from the people of Sebaste, the name given to Samaria by Herod in 25 B.C. in honor of Augustus. Beliar is then identified with Simon Magus or simply said to be associated with Samaria as an anti-Messiah.49 In fact, however, there is no parallel for an anti-Messiah from Samaria in Jewish writings. b. The phrase \"ek Sebastenon\" means \"from the line of the Augusti.\"50 In this case Beliar can be most plausibly identified with Nero. This interpretation is supported by two parallels. First there is the prominence of Nero as an eschatological adversary throughout the Sibylline corpus.51 Second, in the Ascension of Isaiah 4:1, Beliar is clearly said to come in the likeness of Nero (\"a lawless king, the slayer of his mother\"). Most probably, then, Sibylline Oracles 3.63-74 should be taken as a reference to Nero. It was added sometime after A.D. 70 to bring this collection up to date with current eschatological expectations. Even if we were to understand verse 63 as a reference to Sebaste we would have to assume that it was a late insertion in its present context. PROVENANCE The interest in Cleopatra points to an Egyptian setting for verses 75-92, and this is confirmed by the reference to Egypt in verse 46. Nothing in the other passages is incompatible with Egyptian provenance. HISTORICAL AND THEOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE The opening forty-five verses of Sibylline Oracles 3 and the fragments are important as 44 A. Kurfess, \"Christian Sibyllines\" in HSW, vol. 2, p. 707. On the other fragments see A. Kurfess, \"Wie sind die Fragmente der Oracula Sibyllina Einzuordnen?\" Aevum 26 (1952) 228-35. 45 Nikiprowetzky attempts to include in SibOr 3 not only the present vss. 1-96 but also the fragments found in Theophilus and the fragment of Ps-Phoc from SibOr 2 (La Troisieme Sibylle, p. 65).

God is eternal (3.15), self-begotten, and invisible (3.11). Great emphasis is laid on the contrast between perishable and imperishable (frags. 1-3) and on the unity and uniqueness of God. Idolatry is the supreme sin because it is not in accordance with truth. This highly spiritual religion is not, however, adverse to sacrificial cult but insists only that it be offered to the true God (frag. 1:20-22). The passages 46-62 and 75-92, referring to the end-time, are important indicators of the reaction of some Egyptian Jews to the defeat of Cleopatra. The tone in each oracle is one of bitter disillusionment. The main emphasis falls on a day of destruction—with brimstone from heaven in 3.60f. and the collapse of the heavens, accompanied by a stream of fire from heaven in verses 80-85. It is noteworthy that here, after the battle of Actium, the horizons of the Sibyl are no longer confined to Egypt but extend to the whole world. The \"holy prince\" of 3.49 will gain sway over the whole earth. This conception of the savior figure may well be influenced by Roman propaganda, which emphasized the universality and eternity of the empire.52 Again in verses 75-92 the Sibyl is concerned with the whole universe, but this time there is no mention of a savior figure. Drawing on the language of Isaiah 34:4, the Sibyl envisages the collapse of the heavens and a final conflagration. The widow Cleopatra brings widowhood and desolation on the universe. Like Babylon in Isaiah 47:8f., her claim to universal rule is made void by her widowhood. The destruction of the heavens is an important recurring theme in the Sibylline Oracles. The most striking elaboration is found in Sibylline Oracles 5.512-31.

This is found in Sibylline Oracles 4.49-101. There we read that the Assyrians will rule for six generations, the Medes for two, and the Persians for one. Then the tenth generation and fourth kingdom coincide in the Macedonian Empire. We should expect that this climactic generation would be followed by a definitive kingdom or judgment, but instead we find history prolonged to refer to Rome and its eventual downfall (145-48). Since Rome is not integrated into the numerical schematization of history we must assume that verses 102-51 are a later addition, and that the original oracle referred lo no historical empire after Macedonia. We should expect, however, that the original oracle built up to some conclusion, which is not now contained in verses 49-101. It is quite possible that the conclusion now found in verses 173-92, which tells about the end-time, also formed the conclusion of the original oracle, but this, of course, cannot be conclusively demonstrated.2 The second stage of the oracle is found in verses 1-48 and 102-72 (and possibly 173-92). Verses 102-51 are a collection of oracles relating to particular events and legends that bring the older oracle up to date. Verses 1-48 and 152-72 give the moral and religious teachings of the redactor. There is no trace of Christian redaction in Sibylline Oracles 4. Date and provenance The original oracle was probably written not long after the time of Alexander. * The Macedonian Empire is thought to have lasted only one generation, and there is no clear reference to any events between the death of Alexander and the rise of Rome. In schematizations of history of this sort the last enumerated kingdom/generation is either a glorious one (e.g. the seventh king in SibOr 3) or is especially marked out for destruction (as in Dan 2 and 7). Since the Macedonians do not in any sense usher in a glorious age in Sibylline Oracles 4 we must assume that the oracle was anti-Macedonian in tendency. If the present conclusion was part of the original oracle, then Macedonia would have been the immediate victim of the judgment of God. Such an oracle could have been written in any place that was subject to Macedonia. Although the schematization of history may reflect Persian influence,4 the oracle is not likely to be Persian, since the Persians are allotted only one generation of world empire, and the author shows no special sympathy for them. Nothing in the oracle necessarily requires Jewish authorship. Even the passage about the end-time, 173-92, while it probably contains at least Jewish redactional elements, could have been largely composed by a gentile, as both the destruction of the world by fire and the resurrection of the dead could be derived from Persian doctrines.5 Also the reference to the Flood in verses 51-53 could be derived from Babylonian or even Greek tradition. The particular 1 The most important discussions of SibOr 4 are those of Geffcken, Komposition und Entstehungszeit, pp. 18-21; J. Thomas, Le Mouvement baptiste en Palestine et Syrie (Gembloux, Belgium, 1938) pp. 46-60; V.

However, that vs. is probably part of the later redaction and, in any case, the identification of the earthquake in question is doubtful. Cf. Lanchester, APOT, vol. 2, p. 395. 4 See Flusser, Israel Oriental Studies 2 (1972) 162-74. 5 See Collins, JJS 25 (1974) 374. On the role of the conflagration in Zoroastrianism see R. Mayer, Die biblische Vorstellung vom Weltbrand (Bonn, 1956) pp. 1-79.

B.C)."},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"enumeration of world kingdoms, Assyria, Media, Persia, Macedonia, cannot be derived from the Book of Daniel, where the first empire is Babylon; it is paralleled in Tobit 14 and in Roman sources6 and so was widely known in the eastern Mediterranean. While Jewish authorship remains as plausible as any other, there is nothing distinctively Jewish about the original oracle. The redaction of Sibylline Oracles 4 can be located with more precision. It refers to the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple (116), the legend of Nero's flight to the Parthians and future return (119-24, 138-39),7 and the eruption of Vesuvius in A.D. 79 (130-35). All scholars agree that it was written shortly after the last datable event mentioned—therefore about A.D. 80. Its Jewish character is revealed by its doctrines and most specifically by the fact that it understands the eruption of Vesuvius as a punishment for the destruction of Jerusalem (136). The geographical provenance of the first-century redaction is more controversial. Most scholars locate it in Syria or the Jordan Valley because of the importance attached to baptism,8 and, while the evidence is less than conclusive, this position carries the balance of probability. Recently Nikiprowetzky has attempted to associate it with Sibylline Oracles 3 and 5, and therefore to assign it to Egypt.9 However, Sibylline Oracles 4 shows an attitude to the Temple diametrically opposed to what we find in Sibylline Oracles 3 and 5. In the latter two books the Temple plays a central role. In Sibylline Oracles 4.5-12 and 27-30 there is a complete rejection of temple worship.10 Since Sibylline Oracles 5 must be dated later than'Sibylline Oracles 4, the difference in attitude to temple worship cannot be explained by the fact that the Jewish Temple was no longer in existence when book 4 was written. Sibylline Oracles 4 also attaches far greater importance to baptism than either books 3 or 5. Since the only reference to Egypt in book 4 (vs. 72) is part of the hellenistic oracle,\" there is no basis whatever for Egyptian provenance. Historical and theological importance The hellenistic oracle is important as a specimen of anti:Macedonian political prophecy. Our appreciation of the hellenistic oracle is, however, hindered by doubt as to how it originally concluded. The periodization of the hellenistic oracle has multiple parallels in Jewish apocalyptic. The ten generations appear in the Apocalypse of Weeks in 1 Enoch, the Melchizedek text from Qumran Cave 11, Sibylline Oracles 1 and 2, but also in the Cumean Sibyl, as reported by Servius in his commentary on the Fourth Eclogue.12 The four kingdoms are best known from Daniel 2 and 7, but are also found in Aemilius Sura and the Persian Zand-I Vohuman Yasn.13 It should be noted that Sibylline Oracles 4 is concerned with world history only since the Flood (vss. 51-53). Therefore, its four kingdoms, followed presumably by a destruction of fire, are analogous to the four generations that come between the Flood and the destruction by fire in Sibylline Oracles 1 and 2. The view of the end-time of Sibylline Oracles 4, with its emphasis on bodily resurrection, finds its closest parallel in Sibylline Oracles 2. In both Sibylline books the good are restored to life on earth while the wicked are condemned to the underworld. The description in Sibylline Oracles 2 is, however, much more elaborate and probably represents a later stage of this tradition about the end-time. The Jewish first-century redaction used the schematization of history as a framework for exhortation. In verses 161-77 we get a concise summary of what is necessary to avert disaster—to refrain from violence, \"wash your whole bodies in perennial rivers\" and supplicate God. The rejection of violence is, of course, commonplace, although we should note that deeds of violence are 6 See Flusser, Israel Oriental Studies 2 (1972) 153-62: J. W.

However, the distinctive requirement, if disaster is to be averted, is baptism. The role of baptism here and its relation to the judgment is strikingly reminiscent of John the Baptist and quite different from the ritual washings of Sibylline Oracles 3.592L, which are not presented in an eschatological context. This baptism is also quite different from the ritual washings of the Essenes despite the efforts of scholars to identify them.14 Our knowledge of the doctrines of the Jewish first-century redactor is supplemented by verses 1-48. There we find polemic against idolatry (6f.), sexual offenses (33f.), injustice, and violence. Monotheism and God's power as creator are emphasized. The distinctive doctrine of these verses, however, is the rejection of temple worship. According to verses 8-11, God does not have a temple of stone, but one which is not made by hands. According to verses 27-30, the pious reject all temples and sacrificial cults. While these passages are not specifically an attack on the Jewish Temple (which no longer existed), they undermine the very idea of temple worship and make no allowance for the possibility of an acceptable temple. This rejection of temple worship has its parallels in the Bible, most proximately in the speech of Stephen in Acts 7. The distinctive doctrines of Sibylline Oracles 4 then are baptism, as a prerequisite for salvation, and the rejection of temple cults. To these must be added a lively expectation of the end. This complex of doctrines finds its closest parallels in the beliefs of the Christian Ebionites and Elcasaites.15 There is nothing in Sibylline Oracles 4 to suggest Christian authorship, but the book was presumably written in Jewish baptist circles, of a kind similar to those Christian sectarian movements and perhaps historically related to them. 14 Most recently Peretti, Laparola del passato 17 (1962) 247-95, and Noack, Studia Theologica 17 (1963) 92-102.

This should not be interpreted with Lanchester as a reference to a specific event. As in the parallel Sibylline passages, it attests the common Asiatic hope for vengeance on Rome. See the Introduction to SibOr 3 on vss. 350-80. e2. The most obvious parallel to the baptism of SibOr 4 is provided by John the Baptist, who also preached a baptism of repentance in the face of im­minent eschatological destruction. Baptism and es­chatology are also linked in the Ebionite and Elca-saite sects (PseudClemRec 1.54-65; Hippolytus, Ref 9; Epiphanius, AdvHaer 19, 30). The baptism of SibOr 4 shows little resemblance to the ritual washings of the Essenes. All that we know of the baths of the Essenes from Josephus or from the Qumran scrolls points to daily purifications, not to a baptism of repentance. The ritual washings in SibOr 3.591-93 also refer to daily purifications. 12. The destruction of the world by fire was part of several traditions in the hellenistic age. In Stoicism, the ekpurosis, \"conflagration,\" would reduce every­thing to its primal substance. The doctrine of the Great Year, found already in Heraclitus and Plato, envisaged two great cycles, one ending in a flood, the other in a conflagration (e.g. Plato, Timaeus, 22b). This idea is found in Berossus (Seneca, Nat-urates quaestiones 3.29.1) and may have influenced SibOr 1 and 2 and even SibOr 4, which deals only with the period after the Flood. It is also found in Vita 49, Josephus, Ant 1.2.3 (70f.), and 2Pet 3:6f. Fire as a stream of molten metal is a standard feature of Persian eschatology. In the Bundahishn this stream of fire melts mountains and makes the earth level. The Oracle of Hystaspes also predicted the destruction of the world by fire (Justin, Apologies 1.20). In the biblical tradition fire is an instrument of Yahweh's judgment (Amos 7:4; Isa 66:16, etc.). The belief in a final conflagration is attributed to both the Essenes and the Pharisees by Hippolytus (Ref 9). It is attested in 1QH 3.29-33; IEn 52:6; and Ps-Sophocles (Ps-Justin De Monorchia 3; Clement, Strom 5.121.4-122.1)."},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"g2.

The next four oracles are (2) 52-110; (3) 111-78; (4) 179-285; (5) 286-434. These show a common pattern: a. Oracles against various nations. In (2) and (4) the oracles are mainly against Egypt, in (3) and (5) against Asiatic countries. b. The return of Nero as an eschatological adversary. c. The advent of a savior figure. d. A destruction, usually by fire. (The manner of destruction is not specified in [2].) Finally, there is a concluding oracle (6), verses 435-530. This oracle is largely concerned with Egypt. Verses 493-504 describe the building of a temple to the one true God in the land of Egypt and its subsequent destruction by the Ethiopians. The oracle concludes with an elaborate battle of the stars (512-53). The only passage in Sibylline Oracles 5 that reflects Christian redaction is verses 256-59. Even here it is probable that a reference to a Jewish savior figure in the original Jewish oracle has been modified only by an allusion to the crucifixion.3 Date The prominence of the Nero legend in (2), (3), (4), and (5) requires a date no earlier than A.D. 70 but more probably later than 80. The latest possible date for the collection is supplied by the favorable reference to Hadrian in verses 46-50, which must have been written before the Jewish revolt of A.D. 132. Not all sections of the book were necessarily written at the same time. The bitterness of complaint about the destruction of the Temple (cf. esp. vss. 398-413) suggests that at least the central oracles—(2), (3), (4), and (5)—were not far removed in time from that event. By analogy with 4 Ezra and 2 Baruch we might suggest a date in the last years of the first century A.D. Expectation of Nero's return is also likely to have flourished at that time. One detail may give a closer indication of date. In a number of places the Sibyl speaks of the destruction or dereliction of pagan temples (52-59,484-91). The destruction of pagan temples was a notable feature of the Jewish revolt in the Diaspora of A.D. 115.4 We may see in these Sibylline oracles an indication of the atmosphere which fostered that revolt in the early years of the second century. The opening oracle, (1), which refers to Hadrian, must be dated after the revolt. The concluding oracle, (6), which has no reference to a saving figure and is considerably more pessimistic in tone than the other oracles, may also be thought to reflect the failure of the revolt.5 Provenance The Egyptian origin of Sibylline Oracles 5 is not disputed. Sections (2) and (4) deal 1 See especially Collins, The Sibylline Oracles, pp. 73-95. SibOr 5 is discussed by Geffcken, Komposition und Entstehungszeit, pp. 22-30: Rzach, Pauly-Wissowa 2A, cols. 2134-40; Nikiprowetzky, HUCA 43 (1972) 30-33. 2 See Lanchester, APOT, vol. 2, p. 373. The objection to vs. 51 is that a Jew who wrote of Hadrian in favorable terms must have written before the Jewish revolt of A.D. 132. 3 Collins, The Sibylline Oracles, p. 88, following Lanchester, APOT, vol. 2, p. 402; B. Noack, \"Der hervorragende Mann und der Beste der Hebraer (SibOr 5.256-59),\" Annual of the Swedish Theological Institute 3 (1964) 122-46; Kurfess, Sibyllinische Weissagungen, p. 310, takes the passage as Jewish, consisting of a hybrid reference to Moses and Joshua. 4 See A. Fuks, \"Aspects of the Jewish Revolt in A.D. 115-117,\" Journal of Roman Studies 51 (1961) 98-104. 5 See Collins, The Sibylline Oracles, pp. 94f. There is little substantial disagreement on the date of SibOr 5. All scholars date it between A.D. 80 and 130."},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"primarily with Egypt. In verse 53 (2) the Sibyl claims to be the familiar friend of Isis. The opening section, (1), begins with a reference to Egypt and includes a reference (vss. 17-18) to Cleopatra. The final section of the book, (6), includes a direct address to Isis (484) and Sarapis (487) and looks forward to the erection of a temple to the true God in the land of Egypt. Egyptian references are lacking in sections (3) and (4), but there is nothing in these sections incompatible with Egyptian authorship. The manner in which Sibylline Oracles 5 alternates its emphasis on Egypt and Asia suggests deliberate arrangement. Sibylline Oracles 5 continues the major themes of Sibylline Oracles 3—interest in the Temple, expectation of a savior figure, the eschatological adversary (cf. SibOr 3.611; 75-92). Like Sibylline Oracles 3, it has little of the formal periodization characteristic of books 1 and 2 and 4. Sibylline Oracles 3 and 5 can be seen as the two extremities of one tradition in Egyptian Judaism. In Sibylline Oracles 5.501-3 we read that there will be a temple to the true God in the land of Egypt,6 which will be destroyed by an Ethiopian invasion. It is not clear, however, whether the Sibyl actually envisages an invasion from Ethiopia. The Ethiopians are said to leave the Triballi, who were properly a tribe in Thrace, and this makes little geographical sense. In Sibylline Oracles 3.319f. the Ethiopians are identified with Gog and Magog and so may be understood as a general name for eschatological adversaries. It is possible then that the destruction of the temple in Egypt, which precipitates the battle of the stars, is actually the destruction of Leontopolis by the Romans. However, even if we should understand both the temple and its destruction as eschatological, the idea would be more intelligible if the Sibyllist stood in a tradition once related to Leontopolis. Historical and theological significance Sibylline Oracles 5 is an important witness to at least one strand of Egyptian Judaism in the period between the Jewish revolts. By contrast with Sibylline Oracles 3, book 5 shows advanced alienation from all its gentile neighbors. In the period between the two books relations between Jews and gentiles in Egypt had deteriorated considerably.7 Whereas Sibylline Oracles 3 could look to the Ptolemaic house with enthusiasm, Sibylline Oracles 5 shows clear antipathy to the Egyptians (e.g. vss. 82-85 and 484-96) and their persecution of the Jews (vss. 68f.). Consequently two sections, (2) and (4), are dominated by oracles of doom for Egypt. Much more powerful, however, is the Sibyl's animosity toward Rome. The outburst against Rome in verses 162-78 is unparalleled in bitterness anywhere in the Sibylline Oracles. Rome is denounced because of immorality, adultery, and homosexuality (166), but more significantly because of the destruction of Jerusalem (160-61). Ultimately Rome had laid claim to divine honors—\"you said, *I alone am, and no one will ravage me.' \" (vs. 173) For this reason she must be cast down.8 The great adversary of the end-time in Sibylline Oracles 5 is the Roman emperor Nero. Utilizing the popular legend that Nero had fled to Parthia and would one day return, the Sibyl presents him both as king of Rome (vs. 139) and as leading an attack on Rome in the eschatological time (vs. 367). It should be noted that Nero was expected to return from the Parthians, not (at least explicitly) from the dead.9 In verse 147 he is said to go to the Persians. In verse 93 he is referred to as a Persian. In verse 363 he is said to come from the ends of the earth. He is not yet identified with Belial as he is in Sibylline Oracles 3.63-74 and in Ascension of Isaiah 4:1, but his wickedness consists, in large part, of his claim to be God (vss. 34, 139f.). In fact the evil of Nero has the same three dimensions as the evil of Rome: he is morally evil,10 he was responsible for the destruction of Jerusalem (vs. 150), since the Jewish war began in his reign, and he claimed to be God. The four central oracles, (2), (3), (4), (5), contain references to a savior figure—in verses 108f., 155-61, 256-59, and 414-25. The striking feature of this figure is that he is depicted 6 The idea had a biblical basis in Isa 19:19 but is nevertheless highly unorthodox. 7 See Collins, The Sibylline Oracles, pp. 76f. 8 Ibid., p. 79. 9 See A. Yarbro Collins, The Combat Myth in the Book of Revelation (Harvard Dissertation Series; Missoula, Mont., 1976) p. 177. 10 His major crime was matricide (vss. 30, 142, and 363) but he is also accused of violence and of \"sinning against spouses\" (146)."},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"as coming from heaven. This is most explicit in 414, where he is said to come \"from the expanses of heaven.\" In verse 256 the savior figure is said to come \"from the sky,\" but since verse 257 is clearly Christian, 256 may also be redactional. In verse 108 the savior figure is a king \"from God\" who is sent against Nero. This figure is not necessarily heavenly (cf. SibOr 3.286) but obviously could be. In section (3) the function of the savior is exercised by \"a great star\" that comes from heaven and burns the sea and Babylon (158f.). Stars were frequently associated with savior figures in the hellenistic world.\" Messianic figures in Judaism could be designated as stars by application of the Oracle of Balaam.12 The leader of the Jewish revolt in A.D. 132 was given the name Bar Kokhba, son of the star. Stars were frequently identified with angels in Jewish tradition.13 The star that destroys the sea and Babylon (here a metaphor for Rome) in Sibylline Oracles 5.158f. must be seen in the Jewish tradition of angelic or heavenly savior figures represented by Michael in the Book of Daniel, in the War Scroll from Qumran Cave 1, and Melchizedek in the text from Qumran Cave ll.14 The heavenly character of the savior figure in Sibylline Oracles 5 reflects the alienation of the Jewish community from its environment. In Sibylline Oracles 3 the Sibyllist could hope for a savior figure from the Ptolemaic house. In Sibylline Oracles 5 he must look outside the earthly realm for a heavenly figure. Two passages in Sibylline Oracles 5 envisage a restored and glorious Jerusalem (vss. 249-55 and 420-27). In each case the restoration is upon the earth. According to verse 251 the wall of Jerusalem will extend as far as Joppa. Both passages emphasize that Jerusalem will be admired by other nations. There is no question here of resurrection of the dead. The emphasis in Sibylline Oracles 5, however, falls not on restoration but on destruction. This is most strikingly evident in the final section of the book. Even the temple of the true God in Egypt will be destroyed by the Ethiopians (vs. 507). The books ends with a conflagration of the earth and desolation of the heavens, without any sign of further hope. ETHICS The ethics of Sibylline Oracles 5 are reflected chiefly in the vices for which the nations are condemned. As elsewhere in the Sibylline Oracles we find polemic against idolatry (vss. 75-85, 278-80, 353-56, 403-5, 495f.) and sexual offenses, especially homosexuality (vss. 386-93, 430). The most striking feature of the piety of Sibylline Oracles 5, however, is its emphasis on the Temple and cultic piety. Verses 406f. recall the sacrifices offered to God in the Temple and, in the final section, a temple in Egypt is envisaged where sacrifices will be offered. This interest in sacrifices is remarkable in view of the fact that the Temple had been destroyed for several years. It shows the gulf that separates the tradition in which Sibylline Oracles 5 stands from that of Sibylline Oracles 4. Relation to other literature Apart from its relation to Sibylline Oracles 3, book 5 has its most significant contacts with the Revelation of John. While the total eschatological conceptions of the two books are quite different, they share a number of important motifs.15 Chief of these are the use of the Nero legend (Rev 13:3, 18; 17:11), the designation \"Babylon\" applied to Rome (SibOr 5.159; Rev 18), the contrast of the two cities, Rome and Jerusalem (cf. SibOr 5.418-25; in Rev contrast ch. 18 with ch. 21), and certain astral imagery (SibOr 5.155-59; Rev 8:10; 9:1). The final conflagration and battle of the stars finds it closest parallel in Seneca, Consolatio ad Marciam 26.6, which is influenced by Stoic doctrines but can also be understood against the biblical background of such passages as Isaiah 34:4. The opening oracle in Sibylline Oracles 5.1-11 is a summary of Sibylline Oracles 11 but the two books share little beyond this. See the introduction to Sibylline Oracles 11. 11 See Collins, The Sibylline Oracles, pp. 90-92. 12 Num 24:17; cf*. TJud 24:1. At Qumran the Oracle of Balaam is used in both CD and 4QTest. 13 E.g.

There is nothing to indicate a Jewish or pagan substratum in this book. It consists of a brief account of the career of Christ, beginning with his baptism and concluding with an apostrophe to the cross. The hymn has been designated heretical by Geffcken1 because of the association of fire with the baptism of Christ in verse 6, which is paralleled in Sibylline Oracles 7.84. Geffcken sees a parallel here to the Gospel of the Ebionites, but there the reference is to a light which shone around Christ rather than to fire.2 The Gospel of the Ebionites also begins with the baptism of Christ, but the evidence is not sufficient to support a literary relationship between the two works. Kurfess has rightly protested that the association of fire with the baptism of Christ is not necessarily sectarian in any case.3 The latest possible date for this hymn is fixed by the fact that Lactantius (c. A.D. 300) cites it. Geffcken very tentatively proposes a second-century date, because the meter is better than is usual in third-century works.4 This criterion must be considered dubious. Kurfess posits that Sibylline Oracles 7 depends on Sibylline Oracles 6 for the association of fire with the baptism of Christ, but in fact there is nothing to suggest literary dependence between the two books.5 At most the parallel would suggest that the books come from similar milieus. The interest in baptism in the Jordan might suggest that Sibylline Oracles 6 originated near the Jordan Valley, but this again is by no means necessary. Ultimately all we can say with confidence about the provenance of Sibylline Oracles 6 is that it was written by a Christian before the time of Lactantius. The idea expressed in verse 37, that the cross would be taken up to heaven, was popular in later Christian writings.6 1 Geffcken, Komposition und Entstehungszeit, p. 31, following Alexandre and Mendelssohn. 2 Epiphanius, AdvHaer 30.13. 3 Kurfess, Sibyllinische Weissagungen, p. 313. 4 Geffcken, Komposition und Entstehungszeit, p. 32. 5 Kurfess, HSW, vol. 2, p. 708.

Much of the intervening section is taken up with oracles against various nations and places: verses 1-6, 16-23, 40-63, 96-117. These could very well have been derived from pagan oracles. The sequence of references is chaotic. So verses 40-50 refer to a war of Rome with the Parthians, which ended in the rout of the Romans, possibly at Carrhae. This is followed by an oracle on Troy (51-54). Later the Sibyl returns to Rome (vss. 108-11), but the reference is to the rise of Rome after the fall of Macedonia. These oracles of destruction are interrupted by an eschatological passage in 24-39, which includes a conflagration (24-28) and a messianic prophecy (29-39), and by a passage on the baptism of Christ, followed by certain ritual prescriptions in 64-95. The latter passage contains the most distinctive doctrines of Sibylline Oracles 7. The book concludes with a confession of the Sibyl.3 Since the book is framed by passages on the Flood and conflagration it corresponds approximately to the second half of Sibylline Oracles 1 and 2 and, less directly, Sibylline Oracles 4. However, one important feature is missing. The periodization, which was the main structuring element in the earlier oracles, is completely lacking. The eschatology of in Sibylline Oracles 7 has close affinities with both Sibylline Oracles 4 and Sibylline Or­acles 2. There is nothing to suggest a Jewish substratum in the book. The hope in the house of David (29-39) does not envisage an earthly kingdom but the enthronement of Christ above the angels. Date Most scholars have dated Sibylline Oracles 7 to the second century,4 but there is no clear evidence. The latest possible date is provided by Lactantius.3 The vague and disordered historical prophecies provide no clear allusion later than the time of Christ. The second-century date has been proposed mainly on the basis of the alleged Jewish-Christian and gnostic character of the book. In fact, there is nothing in the book to enable us to fix its date with any precision within the second and third centuries. Provenance The provenance of the book is equally elusive. The interest in the baptism of Christ and the fact that Christ is introduced in an oracle against Coele-Syria and Phoenicia might suggest that Sibylline Oracles 7 was composed somewhere in Syria, but this is very far from conclusive. Theological and historical importance The book has been designated \"gnostic\" and \"Jewish-Christian\" by Geffcken and 1 The main discussions of SibOr 7 are: Geffcken, Komposition und Entstehungszeit, pp. 33-37; Rzach, Pauly-Wissowa 2A, cols. 214If.; Kurfess, Sibyllinische Weissagungen, pp. 313-16; and J.

Neither of these references in a Christian context in the second or third century need necessarily imply affinity with Judaism. The house of David is summed up in an individual figure, presumably Christ, who is enthroned above the angels (32-35). The term \"Hebrews\" may well be used in a spiritual sense or merely be an allusion to Revelation 2:9; 3:9.7 Of course, the possibility that Sibylline Oracles 7 was produced by people who were Jews by race cannot be ruled out, but the evidence is inconclusive. A number of unusual references in the book have gnostic parallels:8 1. On the towers in verse 71, compare Acts of Thomas 17-23, where Thomas builds a spiritual palace (cf. ShepHerm Vis 3.3.3, 4.1). 2. On Uranus as a mythological person (vs. 71) compare Epiphanius, AdvHaer 31.3. 3. On God's noble \"mothers\" (Hope, Piety, and Holiness, vss. 72-73) compare Irenaeus 1.5.2L, Epiphanius, AdvHaer 31.5 (also ShepHerm Vis 3:8). 4. On the \"third lot\" (vs. 139) compare Pistis Sophia (244-45). 5. On the \"Ogdoad\" (vs. 140) compare Epiphanius, AdvHaer 31.6. These allusions are isolated in Sibylline Oracles 7 and, at least in the case of the Ogdoad, quite out of context. Gager is surely right in insisting that they do not make the book gnostic in any clearly defined sense. They show that this Sibyl, who drew freely on gentile oracles, was familiar with some gnostic terminology and could draw on it too. Ultimately we cannot identify Sibylline Oracles 7 with any known sect. Yet the interest of the book is considerable if only as a specimen of the diversity within second- or third-century Christianity. The author is clearly Christian, however unusual his Christianity, and is also monotheistic, as his polemic against idolatry shows (vss. 14, 21, 129-31).9 Sacrifice is replaced by a strange rite commemorating the baptism of Christ (76-84). Water is sprinkled on fire and a dove released to heaven, which is said to symbolize the begetting of the Logos by the Father. Here, as in Sibylline Oracles 6, the begetting of Christ is closely associated, if not identified, with his baptism and also with a theophany by fire. The ritualism of verses 76-84 is continued in verses 85-91, where a rite is prescribed for accepting supplicants. Strikingly, the Sibyl does not enjoin that anything be given to the beggars but only that a prayer be recited over them. Geffcken rightly draws attention to the implications of magic here,10 but they are not sufficient to associate the Sibyl with any particular sect. The eschatology of Sibylline Oracles 7 is closely modeled on Sibylline Oracles 2n and Sibylline Oracles 4. The world will be destroyed by a conflagration, and the wicked will not simply perish but will be tortured by fire forever. The infernal punishment is somewhat more elaborate here than in Sibylline Oracles 4 but does not approach the vividness and detail of Sibylline Oracles 2. As in Sibylline Oracles 4 and Sibylline Oracles 2 the just are rewarded, not by a heavenly life, but by the resurrection and transformation of the earth. Sibylline Oracles 7 does not make an explicit connection between its ritual prescriptions and its eschatology. We should note that sacrifices are also rejected in Sibylline Oracles 4, and the importance attached to the baptism of Christ in book 7 also recalls the importance of baptism in book 4. The final confession of the Sibyl (150-62) is obviously related to the concluding verses of Sibylline Oracles 2. 6 Gager, HTR 65 (1972) 91-97. 7 In Rev 2:9 the reference is probably to people who were Jews by race but whom the author did not consider heirs to the promises of Judaism. 8 See especially Kurfess, HSW, vol. 2, p. 707. 9 Gager's emphasis on the syncretism of the Sibyl must be qualified by this fact. 10 Geffcken, Komposition und Entstehungszeit, p. 34. 11 On the priority of SibOr 2 to SibOr 7 see the introduction to books 1 and 2 and Kurfess, ZNW 40 (1941) 151-65."},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"THE SIBYLLINE ORACLES Book 7 Destruction of various places O Rhodes, you wretched one, for you first will I weep.

Verses 217-500, by contrast, are largely taken up with Christology, the incarnation, and the praises of God. The political concerns that dominated the first half of the book are completely lacking in the second. Within each half of the book there are a number of loosely structured oracles. In verses 1-216 we find: 1-16 refer to the fall of the tower of Babylon and repeat substantially the list of kingdoms found in Sibylline Oracles 3.159-61. There follows (17-36) an admonition against greed. Next we find a series of oracles against Rome: 37-49 attack Rome for idolatry. 50-72 present an attack on Hadrian and expect the return of Nero. 73-130 describe the woes to come upon Rome and the equality of all in the eschatological time. 131-38 predict power and stability for the fifteenth king of Egypt in the sixth generation of Latin kings—i.e. Hadrian.2 139-50 again pick up the Nero legend. 151-59 present yet another prophecy of the return of Nero. 160-68 consist of oracles against various gentile nations. 169-93 describe eschatological upheavals, which, in part at least (vs. 171), have special relevance for Rome. 194-216 relate the eschatological reign of a woman in the tenth generation. Geffcken ascribes three passages to a pagan Sibyl. He rightly notes that verses 131-38, which are favorable to Hadrian, are incompatible with verses 50-72 and are the work of an Egyptian Sibyllist (Hadrian is called the fifteenth king of Egypt). This Sibyllist may have been either a pagan or a Christian, but certainly not a Jew. The oracle was inserted here to counteract or correct the attack on Hadrian in the earlier passage. Geffcken also ascribes verses 160-68 to a pagan Sibyl. These are typical Sibylline verses, the cliches of the genre. They could indeed be taken over from a pagan Sibyl but could just as easily have been composed by a Jew or Christian. In fact, several of the verses seem to be taken from, or modeled on, earlier Jewish Sibyls—160 from Sibylline Oracles 4.101; 162 from 5.17; 164, cf. 3.371; 165f. from 3.363f. A third passage that Geffcken ascribes to a pagan Sibyl is the Nero oracle in verses 151-59. Geffcken rightly notes that Nero is here presented in historical terms with little mythological elaboration.3 However, this is equally true of the other Nero passages in Sibylline Oracles 8 and does not necessarily require gentile authorship. In the rest of the first half of the book Geffcken distinguishes the work of two Christian authors, one in verses 1-49 and 73-130, the other in 50-72, 139-50, 169-216, 337-58. This enables him to unite the two Nero passages (50-72 and 139-50), but the differences which he alleges between the two sets of oracles are exceedingly vague. The persistent interest in Rome rather suggests that the entire first half of the book, except for verses 131-38, is a unified work. Geffcken assumes that all this material is Christian.4 The only evidence to support this view consists of a few random parallels with Christian apologists. Rzach prefers to see the work as Jewish, while admitting that the eschatological reign of the woman (vss. 194-216) 1 The most important discussions are those of Geffcken, Komposition und Entstehungszeit, pp. 38-46 and Rzach, Pauly-Wissowa 2A, cols. 2142-46.

The eschatological passage in verses 205-8 also probably depends on Matthew 11:5 or alternatively on a Christian passage in Sibylline Oracles 1.353-55. However, the indications of Christian origin are confined to the eschatological passage in 194-216. Jewish authorship of the remainder of the first section of Sibylline Oracles 8 is supported by the animosity toward Hadrian in verses 50-59, although no explicit reference is made to the Jewish revolt. More significant is the fact that Nero in verse 141 is said to attack specifically \"the nation of the Hebrews.\" This reference excludes gentile authorship, though not necessarily Christian. Since Sibylline Oracles 8.1-193 contains nothing that is specifically either Jewish or Christian, the question of authorship cannot be decisively settled.6 However, in view of the prominence of Christology in the rest of the book and in the Christian Sibylline Oracles in general, the lack of Christian elements may be a significant indication of non-Christian authorship. We may conclude then that a slight balance of probability favors the Jewish authorship of Sibylline Oracles 8:1-216, with the exception of the gentile oracle in verses 131-38 and the Christian eschatological section in 194-216. Verses 217-500 The second half of the book consists again of a collection of oracles, although separate authorship is not necessarily implied. We find: 217-50: an acrostic poem that spells out with the initials of each line the words Iesous Christos Theou Huios Soter Stauros, \"Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior, Cross.\"7 251-336: a long poem on Christ, including a sketch of his earthly career. 337-58: a description of eschatological disturbances. 359-428: a speech of God that concentrates on denunciation of idolatry. 429-55: a hymn in praise of God. 456-79: the incarnation. 480-500 conclude the book with ethical and ritual exhortation. Geffcken wished to ascribe the eschatological section in verses 337-58 to the author of the first half of the book.8 However, there is no positive reason for this attribution. Since a number of verses in this passage recall the Christian Sibylline Oracles 2, especially in the punishment of the damned (vss. 350-58),9 it should be thought to belong with the clearly Christian second half of the book. Date The date of verses 1-216 can be fixed with some precision. Verses 65-74 envisage the return of Nero during the reign of Marcus Aurelius. Therefore this oracle must have been written before the death of that emperor in A.D. 180. Verses 148f. say that Rome will have completed 948 years before it is destroyed. Strictly speaking, that should point to a date of A.D. 195. However, given that this destruction of Rome is still in the future, and that Sibylline chronology is never exact,10 this statement is quite compatible with a date about A.D. 175. The latest possible date for the second half of the book is provided by Lactantius, who quotes extensively from the entire book. There is no closer indication of date. Geffcken •s Rzach, Pauly-Wissowa 2A, col. 2144. 6 SibOr 8.205-7 might seem to depend on SibOr 1.353-55 or Mt 11:5 and therefore be Christian, but this has been disputed by Kurfess, ZNW 40 (1941) 159. None of the alleged cases of dependence on the NT cited by H. Fuchs, Geistige Wider stand, p. 79, are necessarily so. 7 The first five initials, of course, spell the famous Christian cryptogram Ichthus, \"fish,\" 8 Geffcken, Komposition und Entstehungszeit, p. 41. 9 See Geffcken, Die Oracula Sibyllina, pp. 164f. 10 See Geffcken, Komposition und Entstehungszeit, p. 40."},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"notes similarity of style thoughout the book and suggests that there was no great lapse of time between the various parts.\" Provenance There is nothing to indicate the place of origin of Sibylline Oracles 8. Verses 131-38 were obviously written in Egypt (vs. 138), but the rest of the work could have been written in any part of the Near East that was subject to Rome. Historical and theological importance Sibylline Oracles 8.1-216 is a striking example of anti-Roman prophecy, which surpasses even Sibylline Oracles 5 in vehemence. The explicit basis for this polemic is not, as we might expect, Rome's violation of the sovereignty of any particular people (even the Jews) but rather her greed and social injustice (vss. 18-36). In this respect, and also in the opposition of Rome and Asia (e.g. vs. 72), Sibylline Oracles 8 continues the tradition of Sibylline Oracles 3.350-80. Rome is also attacked for idolatry (vss. 43-49), but the sexual polemic of the earlier Sibylline Oracles is missing. The fate of Rome is that she will be cast down to the underworld, where she will be punished in fire and brimstone (102). This punishment is evidently modeled on the individual tortures described, for example, in Sibylline Oracles 2.305. It is followed by a description of Hades, as the place where all are equal, recalling the description of Sheol in Job 3:17-19. There are references to the resurrection of the dead in verses 83 and 170, but this section of Sibylline Oracles 8 shows little interest in the afterlife. The main theme is the coming destruction of Rome and the removal of its wickedness. The acrostic poem in verses 217-50 is the only example of this phenomenon in the Sibylline Oracles, although acrostics were considered criteria for the authenticity of pagan Sibylline Oracles.12 The use of acrostics here reflects the desire of the Christian author to present his work as a gentile oracle. Chritian forgeries and interpolations of this sort aroused bitter disputes in apologetic debates.13 The remainder of the Christian oracles contain no striking doctrinal peculiarities. There is a polemic against idolatry in verses 377-98. Verses 404-8 recommend almsgiving and charity as a substitute for sacrifice. In verses 480-500 the commandments to love God and neighbor are repeated, and sacrifices are replaced by hymns and pure minds. Sibylline Oracles 8 makes extensive use of the first five Sibylline books. The oracles against Rome are especially close to the tradition of Sibylline Oracles 3.350-80 and Sibylline Oracles 5. They also find close parallels in the Carmen apologeticum of Commodian, a Christian apologist of the fifth century A.D.14 \" Ibid., p. 44. 12 Cicero, De divinatione 2.54, 111, 112.

The end of each book is marked by a prayer of the Sibyl (SibOr 11.315-24, 12.293-99, 13.172f.), and there are similar introductory verses at the beginning of each book. However, the contents of the oracles in each book pick up where the preceding one left off. No one would suggest that all this material was composed by the same author at one time. Rather we have an ongoing tradition that was repeatedly updated. Since every stage presumably had an eschatological conclusion, it is probable that the present ending of Sibylline Oracles 14 was composed early and repeatedly moved back.1 Sibylline Oracles 11 reviews history from the Flood to the death of Cleopatra.2 References to historical figures are not direct but veiled thinly by gematria—i.e. the numbers represented by the letters of a name or only by the initial. Kurfess has suggested that the sequence of kingdoms is modeled on Sibylline Oracles 3.159-61,3 and this seems essentially correct. The first kingdom is the Egyptian (vss. 19-32). Then we find the unhistorical sequence of Persia (47-50), Media (51-60), Ethiopia (61-79),4 Assyria (80-105), Macedonia (186-223), Egypt (232-60), and Rome (261-314). Within this framework Sibylline Oracles 11 has made some modifications. Between the first rule of Egypt and that of Persia there is inserted a Hebrew kingdom (33-41) ruled by Moses. Next, the kingdom of the Assyrians contains no reference to Babylon (unlike SibOr 3.160) and is described in remarkably favorable terms. The Assyrian king is a champion of the law of God (vss. 81-82) and will build the temple of God (vs. 87)! In fact we must understand Assyrians here as a name for the Jews and the king as Solomon.s Verses 109-71 are a digression on Romulus and Remus (vss. 109-71), the Trojan War (122-43), Aeneas (144-62), and Virgil (163-71).6 A confused passage that includes a reference to the Persian invasion of Greece (179-82) intervenes before the rise of the Macedonians. The account of the Ptolemaic Empire dwells at length on the time of Cleopatra (vss. 243-60), and the book culminates in an oracle on the conquest of Egypt by the Romans. Date There is no agreement as to the date of Sibylline Oracles 11. J. Strugnell contends that the present book is not an independent piece but is continued directly in Sibylline Oracles 12.7 Even those who accept the book as an independent unit disagree on its date. Geffcken dates it after A.D. 226 because verse 161 presupposes the fall of the Parthians.8 However, the tense of the verb in question is disputed. Geffcken reads mekuneto, \"tarried,\" but Kurfess emends to mekuneth, which he interprets as a present tense, mekunetai, following Bousset. Even if we retain mekuneto, the use of tenses in the Sibylline Oracles does not permit a firm conclusion that the event in question was already past. Rzach accepts the present tense, \"where the Parthian tarries,\" but still argues for a later date.9 He assumes 1 See esp. W. Scott. \"The Last Sibylline Oracle of Alexandria.\" The Classical Quarterly 9 (1915) 144-47. 2 The main discussions are those of H. Dechent.

Accordingly, Rzach accepts Geffcken's dating of the book to the third century. Both scholars support this date with references to stylistic considerations and to the similarity of Sibylline Oracles 11 to books 12-14. Over against this position, Dechent, Bousset, and Kurfess have argued for a date in the first century A.D. Dechent'S position rests on the extremely dubious argument that the word genee, \"race,\" in verse 159 refers to the Julio-Claudian house, and that the oracle must therefore have been written before the death of Nero.10 It is more natural, however, to understand the genee in verse 159 with reference to Aeneas and the Roman race. Bousset's argument is simply that the oracle would not have stopped with Cleopatra if it were written much later.\" Kurfess supports this argument with further considerations. There is no reference in the book to peoples with whom Rome came into conflict in the second century. There is no reference to the fall of the Temple, and there is little real hostility to Rome. The main object of the Sibyl's wrath is Egypt (298-314). Kurfess infers that the book was written under Augustus or Tiberius, before relations between Jews and Romans in Egypt began to deteriorate in the time of Caligula.12 The argument of Bousset, that an oracle which ends with Cleopatra must be presumed to be written soon after her death, would be conclusive if it were certain that Sibylline Oracles 11 was composed as an independent unit. However, Strugnell's suggestion that Sibylline Oracles 11 and 12 were composed as a unit deserves careful consideration. The date proposed for Sibylline Oracles 11 by Geffcken and Rzach, sometime in the third century, not long after the conquest of Mesopotamia by Septimius Severus, is also a plausible date for Sibylline Oracles 12, which concludes with the death of Alexander Severus. Further, Sibylline Oracles 12.1-11 may be considered a summary of Sibylline Oracles 11, since it singles out the \"citizen of Pella\" (cf. SibOr 11.219: \"Pellaean Ares\"), who falsely claimed descent from Zeus Ammon (11.197), Aeneas, the descendant of Assaracus (11.144), and the \"children of the flock-devouring beast,\" Romulus and Remus (SibOr 11.110-17). Further, Sibylline Oracles 12 picks up where Sibylline Oracles 11 leaves off, has a similarly positive attitude to the Romans, and shows equally little interest in moral and religious questions. However, the question is complicated by the fact that Sibylline Oracles 12.1-11, which provide the summary of Sibylline Oracles 11, are taken directly from Sibylline Oracles 5. Two possibilities therefore emerge: 1. Sibylline Oracles 11 may have drawn on Sibylline Oracles 5. We have seen that much of Sibylline Oracles 11 is built on the list of kingdoms in Sibylline Oracles 3.159-61. Further, the passage on Virgil in verses 163-71 is based on Sibylline Oracles 3.419-25 and even the passages on Cleopatra in 250-53 and the conquest of Egypt in 285-90 are modeled on Sibylline Oracles 3.397-400 and 350-60 respectively. On this hypothesis Sibylline Oracles 11 would be virtually completely composed by borrowings and expansions of earlier Sibyls. 2. Alernatively, Sibylline Oracles 5.1-11 may already have been a summary of Sibylline Oracles 11. Both Sibylline Oracles 5 and 12 are interested primarily in the period after the battle of Actium. Verses 1-11 (common to both books) are distinctly a summary. However, some of the details in that summary, the references to the \"son of Assaracus\" and the \"children of the beast,\" do not occur in any Sibyl earlier than Sibylline Oracles 5, unless we assume an earlier date for Sibylline Oracles 11. The references to the Roman origins could be supplied in Sibylline Oracles 11 from popular lore (or in some part from Virgil) and would have been sought out to complement the Sibylline history of the East. Neither of these hypotheses can be established with certainty, but the second seems the more probable. The choice of details in Sibylline Oracles 5.1-11 is more easily understandable if that passage is summarizing an earlier Sibyl. Further support for an earlier dating can be found in Sibylline Oracles 11.171, which says that Virgil will conceal the Sibyl's writings until after his death. This reference makes most sense if the book was written shortly after Virgil's death in 19 B.C. The anti-Egyptian attitude of Sibylline Oracles 11 fits well with the 10 Dechent, Uber das erste, zweite und elfte Buch, pp. 49-88. \" Bousset, Real-Encyclopedie, p. 278. 12 Kurfess, Sibyllinische Weissagungen, p. 339."},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"picture of Alexandrian Judaism found in such works as 3 Maccabees and the Wisdom of Solomon. Finally, the book is intelligible in itself as an oracle which culminates in the conquest of Egypt and has been recognized by the tradition as an independent book. The fact that Sibylline Oracles 12 picks up where Sibylline Oracles 11 leaves off may be somewhat coincidental, since that is the beginning of the Roman Empire, the subject matter of Sibylline Oracles 12. Otherwise Sibylline Oracles 12 is not conspicuously dependent on book 11 and draws much more directly on Sibylline Oracles 5. The reference to the Parthians in verse 161 should then be understood as a real prophecy. The Parthians were already prominent as a threat to Rome in the East in the first century B.C. An oracle that proclaimed the universal rule of Rome might very naturally prophesy the conquest of the Parthians.to complete the ideal extent of Roman dominion. The stylistic arguments for a later date were adequately refuted by Bousset. Sibyllists at all times and places were capable of poor style and faulty meter.13 Sibylline Oracles 11 then should be dated tentatively about the turn of the era. Provenance There is no doubt that this book was written in Egypt. Its review of history begins with Egypt and ends there, and the culmination of the book is an oracle on the destruction of Egypt. The reference to the foundation of Alexandria in verses 219f. and the eulogy in verses 232-35 suggest that the Sibyllist wrote in that city. Despite the parallels in Sibylline Oracles 3 and Sibylline Oracles 5.1-11 noted above, Sibylline Oracles 11 lacks most of the concerns of books 3 and 5—interest in the Temple, expectation of a savior figure and eschatological judgment, polemic against idolatry and sexual abuses. The motif of widowhood with references to Cleopatra recalls Sibylline Oracles 3.75-92, but this does not require literary dependence as the motif would arise naturally in the context of Cleopatra's defeat. The use of gematria is paralleled in Sibylline Oracles 5.1-51, but this, of course, is not peculiar to the Sibylline Oracles.14 The book is Jewish, as is shown by the references to Joseph (29f.), Moses (38-40), Solomon (80-103) and by the fact that Egypt is said to be finally destroyed because it oppressed God's chosen people (307). There is nothing to indicate a Christian origin or redaction. The oracle may well have been written before the origin of Christianity. The book does not seem to belong to the same tradition as Sibylline Oracles 3 or 5. Yet it can be located in the development of Egyptian Judaism by reference to these other Sibyls. It stands closest to Sibylline Oracles 3.75-92 by its antipathy to Cleopatra, while it lacks the vehemence of that passage. It shows no sign of the resentment against Rome that burns in Sibylline Oracles 5. In fact, the book lacks any criticism of Rome, even such as we find in the earliest stage of Sibylline Oracles 3 (vss. 175-91). Historical and theological importance The only theological interpretation offered in Sibylline Oracles 11 is in verses 307-10, which say that Egypt will be subjected because of its treatment of the Jews. The obvious reference here is to the sojourn in Egypt before the Exodus, but it probably also suggests strained relations between the Egyptians and the community that the Sibyl represents. Otherwise, Sibylline Oracles 11, like books 12-14, is remarkably void of theology. There is no eschatological conclusion. There may have been one, and it is possible that Sibylline Oracles 14.351-61 originally stood at the end of Sibylline Oracles 11 and was moved back gradually as additions were made. Even that passage, however, contains nothing more specific than the hope that the Jewish people would rule the whole earth. There is no description of a judgment, and the review of history is not used to frame ethical and ritual exhortations as is often the case in books 1-5. The historical value of the book is extremely scant. The author's ignorance of history is 13 Bousett, Real-Encyclopedie, p. 278. 14 See F.

The only period on which he seems reasonably well informed is that of Cleopatra, and even there he gives few specific data. The only literary contact of note is with Sibylline Oracles 3, which it echoes in many places, most notably in the list of kingdoms and in the account of Virgil in verses 163-69, which is modeled on Homer in the earlier Sibyl. Unlike most of the other Sibylline Oracles, Book 11 is not a vehicle for religious exhortation. The most obvious function of the book lies in its anti-Egyptian propaganda. Verses 277-97 can be read as a direct rejoinder to the pro-Cleopatran ideology in Sibylline Oracles 3.350-61.

Geffcken sees here a further reference to Moses, who is depicted by Artapanus (a Jewish-Egyptian historian of the 2nd cent, B.C.) as an Egyptian general and also as the founder of the animal cults. Alexandre takes the snake in this passage to represent \"wisdom\" and so to be applicable to Moses. The phrase \"terrible snake\" is, however, most naturally understood in a pejorative sense. It refers to Nero in SibOr 5.29 and 12.81 and to Severus in 12.264. The phrase may refer to some unspecified Pharaoh or rather be a general derogatory reference to the Egyptian monarchy. k.

After the introductory verses 1-11 the review of history proper begins with Augustus (i.e. where SibOr 11 left off) and outlines the history of the emperors to the death of Alexander Severus. There are Christian insertions in verses 30-34 and 232, but the book as a whole is Jewish not Christian. It is unthinkable that a Christian would have written of Domitian in such glowing terms as we find in Sibylline Oracles 12.124-38.2 The references to the Jews in verses 99-104 and 152 and the name Sabaoth for God in verse 132 reflect Jewish rather than pagan authorship. The book concludes with the Sibyl's account of her own inspiration (vss. 293-99). Date and provenance The book is dated by its latest reference, the death of Alexander Severus in A.D. 235 (vs. 288). Like books 11 and 13-14, with which it forms a tradition, it was most probably written in Alexandria—compare the reference to *4the city of Egypt/' in verse 42, and to Egypt as the \"land of splendid fruit'' (vs. 17). Theological and historical importance Like the other late Sibylline Oracles, the book contains little material of theological interest. It does, however, echo the traditional Sibylline polemic against idolatry (vss. 11 If. and 292). -The historical interest of the book is considerable as it provides a rare witness to the popular perception of Roman emperors in the eastern provinces. Fact is mixed with legend and error throughout. Tiberius is erroneously said to have been murdered (vs. 47). Titus is said to have been murdered by his soldiers (122f.). The Sibyl reports bloody drops from heaven in the time of Caligula (vss. 56f.), rain of stone in the reign of Claudius (vs. 75), and miraculous rain in the time of Marcus Aurelius (vs. 200). The latter emperor is said to have been granted whatever he asked by God. The Sibyl gives negative accounts of emperors who were widely unpopular—Caligula (vss. 50-67), Nero (vss. 78-94), Nerva (vss. 142-46), Commodus (vss. 206-28), Septimius Severus (vss. 256-68). However, the general attitude to the emperors is favorable. Praise is lavished on Augustus (vss. 12-35), Domitian (vss. 124-38), Hadrian (vss. 163-75), and Marcus Aurelius (vss. 187-205). Most significant is the treatment of the emperors who suppressed Jewish revolts. Vespasian is admittedly a destroyer of pious men (vs. 99), but greatest attention is paid to his destruction of Phoenicia and Syria (vss. 105-12), and these countries are said to be punished for idolatry. Vespasian himself is described at the end as 4 4noble\" and 4'excellent\" (vss. 115f.).

Some verses are lost at the beginning, before verse 7, but the first clear reference is to Gordianus III (A.D. 240-44) in verses 13-20. The review of history is very brief and extends only to the time of Odenath of Palmyra, in the reign of Gallienus (A.D. 260-68) in verses 150-73. The reference to the persecution of Decius in verses 87f. is assumed by all commentators to have been written by a Christian. Geffcken assumed that the entire work is Christian. Against this, Rzach, followed by Kurfess, has pointed out that there is no reference to the persecution under Valerian or to his capture by the Persians, which a Christian might have seen as a punishment of God.2 Verses 87f. could easily have been inserted later. There is nothing else in the book to suggest Christian authorship. If, then, the book was not written by a Christian, it is probably Jewish, not pagan. This is indicated by the references to divine providence in verse 112, the wrath of the great God (vs. 54) or of the Most High (vs. 109) and the polemic against astrology in verses 69-73 (cf. SibOr 3.227f.).3 Date and provenance Since Sibylline Oracles 13 does not refer to the deaths of either Gallienus or Odenath, it can be dated with some confidence about A.D. 265. The place of origin is less certain. The enthusiasm shown for Odenath of Palmyra might suggest an origin somewhere in Syria, but there is also a eulogy of Egypt and Alexandria in verses 43-49. Since the other Sibylline books with which Sibylline Oracles 13 is in continuity come from Alexandria, this book was probably written there too. Historical and theological importance Apart from the few indications of Jewish authorship listed above, Sibylline Oracles 13 is quite without theological interest. Its historical interest is, however, considerable. Most important are the references to Mareades (also called Kyriades), a Roman traitor who twice tried to lead Parthian forces against Rome and of whom little is known.4 As presented in Sibylline Oracles 13.89-100 and 119-30, this figure is modeled on the Nero legend.5 For the Sibyllist the legend of Nero's return, which was no longer alive in its original form, was actualized in Mareades. The hero of the book is ultimately Odenath of Palmyra, who fought for the Romans against the Parthians. He is twice described as heliopemptos, \"sent from the sun\" (vss. 151, 164), and while the title derives from the association of the sun with Palmyra, the phrase also recalls the savior king of Sibylline Oracles 3.652 and suggests that Odenath too was a savior figure.6 At the end the Sibyl prophesies that Odenath will be \"intact, unblemished, and great,\" and will rule over the Romans (vss. 170f.).

Scott, who was heavily committed to finding authentic historical references in the book, can do no better than suggest \"that each of the several paragraphs was originally composed as an account of some known ruler, but that they were not originally connected together in one series, and that their present arrangement is merely accidental.\"4 Precedent can be found for such random collections of oracles (e.g. SibOr 3.381-489), but in Sibylline Oracles 14 it comprises very nearly the entire book, at least verses 1-283. Since the text is also hopelessly corrupt, the book has little meaning, let alone importance. It is possible to discern that verses 1-283 are, like the preceding books, concerned with Roman emperors, but scarcely any can be identified with any certainty.5 The later part of the book (vss. 284 to the end) is concerned with Egypt rather than Rome. Scott has advanced an elaborate interpretation of these verses with reference to the Arab conquest of Egypt in the seventh century. He relies heavily on emendations, and while no one can doubt that the text he emends is corrupt, that which he produces has only a dubious relation to the tradition and can scarcely serve as the basis for historical inferences. The most interesting part of the book is in verses 340-49, which refer to a battle involving Jews, Arabs, and \"Fair heads\" (Europeans of some sort). Scott sees here the conquest of Alexandria by the Arabs and assumes Jewish collaboration with the conquerers.6 No more plausible identification has been advanced. Date and provenance If Scott's interpretation is correct, the book took its final form no earlier than the seventh century. In any case it seems to be the latest of the Sibylline collection and certainly cannot be earlier than the third century. The poor state of the text and uncertainty of the references prevent any definite conclusion. There is consensus that the book was written by an Alexandrian Jew. The Alexandrian setting is obvious in verses 284-349. The Judaism of the author is reflected chiefly in the eschatological conclusion (vss. 350-61). There is nothing to suggest Christian authorship.7 Historical and theological importance If Scott's interpretation is accepted, Sibylline Oracles 14 acquires some significance with reference to the Arab conquest of Egypt, but the uncertainties are too great for the oracle to have any real importance. The eschatological conclusion portrays a rather communistic 1 The main discussions of SibOr 14 are those of Geffcken, Komposition und Entstehungszeit, pp. 66-68; Rzach, Pauly-Wissowa 2A, cols. 2162-65; and W.

Kurfess has attempted to locate the other fragments within the Sibylline corpus, but they are too brief to admit of confident identifi­cation.2 The theological significance of the fragments lies in their insistence on monotheism and denunciation of idolatry, a common theme in the Sibylline Oracles. They show no trace of the political concerns that dominate the other Jewish books and emphasize the spirituality and eternity of God in a manner reminiscent of Pseudo-Orpheus and Philo. The eschatology of the fragments is presented most fully in fragment 3 and has a strong otherworldly character. The wicked will be burned with torches for all eternity while the righteous will enjoy life in paradise. This emphasis on individual afterlife is quite atypical of the Jewish Sibylline Oracles and is most closely paralleled in the Christian redaction of Sibylline Oracles 2. The fragments are found in Theophilus, Ad Autolycum 2.36 (frags. 1 and 3) and 2.3 (frag. 2) with some parallels in Clement and Lactantius.

A NEW TRANSLATION AND INTRODUCTION BY J. H. CHARLESWORTH This pseudepigraphon, attributed to Shem, the son of Noah, describes the characteristics of the year according to the house of the zodiac in which it begins. Documents like this one, which are technically called calendologia, are also attributed to other biblical personalities; one of these is called the Revelatio Esdrae de qualitatibus anni.1 The Treatise of Shem contains twelve chapters, following the twelve signs of the zodiac running counterclockwise from Aries to Capricorn, but reversing the order of the last two so that Pisces precedes Aquarius. This inverted order was caused by a scribe who omitted a chapter in his haste to finish, but eventually added the missing chapter at the end. The scribe who copied the only extant manuscript, or an earlier scribe, warns the reader that a copyist's mistake places Aquarius after Pisces. Originally the twelve chapters were in an ascending order of desirable features, beginning with Aries, in which apparently the worst year begins, and culminating with Pisces, in which clearly the best year originates: \"there will be peace and prosperity among men, and love and harmony among all the kings who are on the entire earth\" (TrShem 11:18). Text The Treatise of Shem is preserved in a fifteenth-century Syriac manuscript, unbound, in the John Rylands University Library of Manchester (Syr. MS 44, fols. 81b-83b). The base for the present translation2 is a critical edition I am preparing for the SBL Texts and Translations, Pseudepigrapha Series. Original language The four Greek loan words found in the Syriac text are not indicative that the original language is Greek. Each of them (see nn. a to ch. 3, c to ch. 5, d and k to ch. 7, d and g to ch. 11), with the possible exception of harmonia, \"well-ordered\" (see n. d to ch. 7), early passed into and became customary in Syriac. The original language seems to be Semitic 1 See the contribution by D. A. Fiensy and the Introduction (\"Theological importance\") to the GkApEzra by M. E. Stone herein. Also see James, LAOT, pp. 80f., and Charlesworth, PMR, pp. 182-84. Reliable books are F. Cumont's Astrology and Religion Among the Greeks and Romans, trans. J. B.

Because of the lacunae and the corrupt nature of the Syriac text3 it is impossible to discern whether the original language is Hebrew or Aramaic (Syr.). If the provenance is Alexandrian, then Aramaic would be a little more probable. Date It is impossible to date this document precisely and certainly; but it is logically justifiable to assume that the notations are not fictitious but historically based. If this assumption is correct, then the references to the Romans (1:5; 3:6f.; 11:12) would indicate that the document was composed in the Roman period. A. Mingana speculated that this treatise was composed after the ravaging of Palestine by Vespasian or Hadrian.4 His suggestion is unlikely; by that time (c. A.D. 69-138) peace had been established in the Roman Empire, and the singular most notable feature regarding a date of composition is the pervasive references to wars, usually against the Romans (3:6f.; 1:9; 2:2; 3:3; 7:8, 18; 10:10f.; cf. 5:7; 6:13; 12:8). This concern coincides with the terror of war that characterized the eastern portion of the Empire during the first two thirds of the first century B.C., and until Octavian defeated Antony in 31 B.C. at Actium.5 Octavian's own inscriptions and Virgil's writings demonstrate that Octavian was popularly conceived as the one who put an end to war.6 The fear of war between Rome and Egypt—\"And the king of the Romans will not remain in one place ... a great war and misery (will occur) on all the earth, and especially in the land of Egypt\" (1:5-9)—adequately describes the period when Antony was associated with Alexandria and \"married according to Egyptian law\" to Cleopatra (37-30 B.C). This passage may also refer obliquely to the suicides of Antony and Cleopatra, and the merciless acts by Octavian in Alexandria in 30 B.C. The claim that the Romans will defeat the Parthians (3:6f.), if our restoration of the text is accurate, indicates a date shortly after Antony's victory over the Armenians, Medes, and Parthians, and the celebration of this triumph in Alexandria (not in Rome as tradition demanded) in the fall of 34 B.C. Likewise the reference in 12:4—\"And Egypt (will rule) over Palestine\"—also fits nicely into 34 B.C., because in that year Antony, out of his exigencies, especially his need for Cleopatra's money, granted her the rule over Palestine. Then she along with her son Caesarion began a joint reign over it.7 The second most notable feature regarding the date of composition is the reference to and fear of \"robbers,\" \"thieves,\" or \"marauders\" (cf. 7:20; 10:7; 11:11; 12:1; cf. 6:1; 10:1; 11:1). This concern recalls the period before Octavian strengthened the Empire, built impressive and extensive highways, and established a military police, which secured relatively speedy and safe travel within the Empire. These observations cumulatively suggest that the Treatise of Shem was composed in the last third of the first century B.C., probably sometime after the events in the thirties but when the memories of the preceding era were still fresh. It is possible to speculate further regarding the date of composition. Antony or Cleopatra may be the subject of 2:3: \"And a wind will go out from Egypt and will fill the entire earth.\"8 A reference to the battle at Actium between Antony and Octavian may be couched 3 See nn. f to ch. 2, e, g, and i to ch. 5, e to ch. 6, e, j, and o to ch. 7, d and g to ch. 8. 4 Some Early Judaeo-Christian Documents in the John Ry lands University Library: Syriac Texts (Manchester, 1917; pp. 20-29, 52-59; repr. from BJRL 4 [19171 59-118). 5 Conspicuously absent are references to the internal struggles within the Roman Empire during the 1st cent, A.D., Claudius' charge to the Alexandrians to be \"tolerant and friendly to the Jews\" (London Papyrus, 1912), the Nero redivivus myth, the two great Jewish wars (A.D. 66-70, 132-35), both of which exacted great costs in Alexandria— 50,000 Jewish lives were lost there in the first war and the synagogue was burned in the second. No significant historical event after 30 B.C. seems to be portrayed in the TrShem. 6 An inscription at Priene, which is just south of Ephesus in Asia Minor, dated 9 B.C., refers to Octavian as the \"savior, who ... put an end to war and ... set everything in order.\" In his Res gestae diviAugusti, Octavian himself spoke of Actium as \"the crowning victory,\" and pointed with justifiable pride at the peace he had established in the Empire: \"I restored peace to all the provinces of Gaul and Spain and to Germany, to all. . .\" With phrases reminiscent of the dream of a blessed future described in Isa 11, Virgil in his Fourth Eclogue (19-22) spoke of the age Octavian had inaugurated: \"He shall receive the life of gods, and see/Heroes with gods commingling, and himself/Be seen of them, and with his father's worth/Reign o'er a world at peace.\" A reliable edition of the last two texts is contained in C. K. Barrett's The New Testament Background: Selected Documents (London, 1956; New York, 1961). 7 See A. E.

Syme, The Roman"},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"in 2:10: \"two kings will oppose one another.\" Antony's defeat by Octavian in the sea battle at Actium, and his subsequent suicide in Alexandria, may be mentioned in 6:13-17: \"And the king [the Roman Emperor Octavian] will strive with a king [Antony] and will slay him. And Alexandria will be lost . . . And many ships will be wrecked.\" Another reference to the results of this battle may be found in the next chapter, 7:16f.: \"And the king [Octavian] will stay in one place [Octavian ends the intermittent wars and resides in Rome]. And power will leave the land [Egypt will become the personal possession of Octavian, the first Roman king of Egypt].9 And the nobles will flee to the sea, and there will be between (them) [in the sea] a severe war.\" If these conjectures are sound, then our author was thinking about the vicissitudes of life evoked by the defeat of the seemingly invincible Antony and Cleopatra. Although they commanded nearly twice as many men and ships as Octavian, they both deserted Actium before the battle was decided; ironically this is one of the greatest non-battles of history.10 Hence, it appears that a Jew composed this astrological document after 31 B.C.,11 probably by the late twenties, when the victory at Actium had become a major part of Roman propaganda.12 Provenance The two most likely places in which this text was composed are Egypt (mentioned in chs. 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 12) and Palestine (specified in chs. 4, 6, 11). The latter is improbable since there is a reference to robbers who come from Palestine (\"And robbers will come from Palestine\" [11:11]). The numerous references to the Nile (chs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 [restored], 7, 8, 12) demonstrate that the provenance is probably Egyptian; and the products, wheat, barley, peas, are certainly Egyptian crops. The references to irrigation (1:4; 10:18) and illnesses caused by winds bearing desert sands (4:7) increase this probability. References to the city Alexandria (4:3 and 6:14) imply that the provenance may be Alexandrian. The description of the beneficial effects of the north wind (3:1; 5:1; 8:1), the harmful characteristics of the east wind (7:3; 10:2), and the continuous references to the sea (1:10; 2:12 [twice]; 3:7; 4:5; 7:18 [twice, once restored]; 11:5; cf. 10:5), the [se]acoast (10:15), fishing (11:5), and ships (1:10; 2:12; 3:7; 4:5; 6:16; 11:6) denote that the Treatise of Shem was composed probably in Alexandria.13 Revolution (Oxford, 1939) and H. H. Scullard, From the Gracchi to Nero (London, 1970). An attractive account of Alexandria is presented in E. M. Forster's Alexandria: A History and a Guide (Garden City, N.Y., 1961). Scholarly discussions of Jewish life in Alexandria can be found in V. Tcherikover's Hellenistic Civilization and the Jews, trans. S. Applebaum (New York, 1959; repr. 1970); in M. Stern's \"The Jewish Diaspora,\" The Jewish People in the First Century, ed. S. Safrai and M. Stern (Assen, 1974) vol. 1, pp. 117-83; see also pp. 184-215; and in P. M. Fraser's Ptolemaic Alexandria, 3 vols. (Oxford, 1972). 9 According to Samuel, the Ptolemaic kingdom ended on August 3, 30 B.C.; the following year Octavian began to reign (Ptolemaic Chronology, p. 160). ,0 \"The battle of Actium was decided before it was fought\" (Syme, The Roman Revolution, p. 296). 11 Some critics will claim the obvious has not been stated emphatically, affirming the date suggested by pointing to the voluminous astrological treatises pseudonymously attributed to King Nechepso and his priest, Petosiris, that were composed in Alexandria sometime in the 2nd cent. B.C. (Boll, Sternglaube, p. 24; Fraser, Ptolemaic Alexandria, vol. 1, pp. 436f., vol. 2, pp. 632f.; M. Nilsson, Geschichte der Griechischen Religion [Handbuch der Altertums-wissenschaft 5.2.; Munich, 1955—612] vol. 2, p. 269; earlier scholars dated these texts to the second third of the 1st cent. B.C., e.g. W. Kroll, \"Nechepso,\" Pauly-Wissowa 16.2, cols. 2160-67; and E. Riess, \"Astrologie,\" Pauly-Wissowa 2.2, cols. 1802-28, especially cols. 1816L). Dating the TrShem in the last third of the 1st cent. B.C. fits nicely with the observation that astrology began to be popular about the time of Jesus' birth (Nilsson, Geschichte, vol. 2, p. 276). 12 For the myth of Actium see Syme, The Roman Revolution, pp. 297, 440f. Professor J. F. Oates, who read this contribution, opinioned in a letter of February 22, 1978: \"I was convinced that this is the area in which we must date it. It must come after 63 B.C, Pompeii's settlement of the East, and before A.D. 69, the Jewish revolt. Within that time period the whole set of references to particular Roman activity, as well as the movement of the vernal equinox from the House of Aires to Pisces at exactly this time, convinces me that we are talking about a period in the late 20's B.C.\" The severe earthquake in Palestine, which occurred during the battle at Actium, may also have been in the author's mind when he composed 7:19 (see n. k to ch. 7). 13 Alexandria during the hellenistic period was characterized by its astrological ideas (cf. especially Cumont, L Egypte des astrologues; Nilsson, Geschichte der Griechischen Religion, vol. 2, pp. 268-81; Fraser, Ptolemaic Alexandria, vol. 1, pp. 434f.). For examples of zodiacal papyri in late Ptolemaic and early Roman Egypt see O. Neugebauer and R. A. Parker, Egyptian Astronomical Texts, 4 vols. (London, 1960-69; especially see vol. 3, pp. 203-12 and vol. 4, plates 46, 47, and 48). As usual, there are problems that preclude certainty regarding a provenance. Rain is mentioned throughout the treatise, and it almost never rains in Egypt. Perhaps such comments are a convention of this type of writing, or an aspect of the author's dream for a better day (in Jub 12:16-18 Abraham is portrayed as looking to the signs of the stars to see what the year would bring in terms of rain)."},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"Historical importance A few decades ago historians had no clear evidence that Jews composed astrological tracts at the time of Jesus; many good scholars thought this interest surfaced only late in medieval Jewish mysticism. Even quite recently the erudite and informed editors of the Encyclopedia Judaica reported that the zodiac is \"first mentioned in the Sefer Yezirah,\" a document dated somewhere between the third and sixth centuries (EncyJud, vol. 16, col. 1191). Jewish interest in astrology and the zodiac is at least so early as Jesus of Nazareth.14 This new insight is demonstrated by the early date of the Jewish Sibylline Oracles, especially 5.512-31,15 and the discovery among the Dead Sea Scrolls of two Jewish astrological documents, one called 4QCryptic (formerly 4Q186)'6 and the other still unnamed and unpublished.17 The clearest and fullest evidence for an early Jewish interest in astrology had been unknown to scholars, although it has been shelved for most of this century in the famous John Ry lands University Library of Manchester, England. The document is of course the Treatise of Shem, and like 4QCryptic the concern is not with daily manipulations of nature and man by the stars but with the determination of the year or of people (cf. TrShem 8:12) according to the zodiacal house in which they originate or are born. If the historical reconstruction attempted above is accurate, we have a significant and unparalleled Jewish response to one of the most significant and epoch-making sea battles in the history of our culture. Jewish soldiers from King Herod of Judea along with troops from throughout the Eastern Empire united under Antony. Octavian won the battle, nevertheless, and his success at Actium enabled him to unite the \"civilized\" world and to lay the foundations for the greatness of the Roman Empire. He received the title that had been reserved for the gods, and even today he is known as Augustus (\"the exalted one\"). Significant for an understanding of many passages in the Treatise of Shem is the recognition that Augustus Caesar took Egypt as his own personal possession and began to export Egyptian grain to Rome. Theological importance The contention that if the year begins in Virgo then a Jew whose name contains a y, s, b, and n will be robbed and forced to flee his home contradicts the ancient tradition that the Jewish home is protected by God (e.g. cf. Ex 12:13, 22) and each member in it is protected by the solidarity of the family (cf. Lev 25:25; 47-49; Gen 4:23f.). The pervasive idea that fortune, the rise of the Nile, the movement of the stars and the moon, health, and a good harvest depend upon the power of the zodiac flagrantly compromises the ancient tradition that God is lord of the universe (cf. Pss 24, 29) and actively involved in the processes of history (e.g. cf. the cultic confession of faith in Deut 26:5-9; cf. Ps 8). The claim that ample rain depends upon the house of the zodiac in which the year begins compromises the belief that God controls the rain (e.g. cf. Amos 4:7; Zech 10:1), a central Jewish belief popularized by the colorful account of Elijah's successful prayer for rain on Mount Carmel (IKgs 18:1, 41-46),18 and contradicts the idea that people can effect the amount of rain by petition(s), prayers, and other actions (TrShem 10:17). In the Pseudepigrapha this biblical perspective is reaffirmed in an antiastrological context. The author of Jubilees, who venerated Shem (cf. Jub 7:10-18; 8:18; 10:13f.; 19:24f.), 14 See my \"Jewish Astrology in the Talmud, Pseudepigrapha, the Dead Sea Scrolls and Early Palestinian Syn­agogues,\" HTR 70 (1977) 183-200. 15 See the discussion and translation of the SibOr herein by J. J. Collins. Book 5 was composed early in the 2nd cent. A.D. The TrShem is at least a century older, according to our dating. 16 Published by J. M. Allegro in \"An Astrological Cryptic Document from Qumran,\" JSS 9 (1964) 291-94; repr. DJD 5, 88-91, plate XXXI. See J. Carmignac, \"Les Horoscopes de Qumran,\" RQ 5 (1965) 199-217. 17 See J. T. Milik, Ten Years of Discovery in the Wilderness of Judaea, trans. J. Strugnell (SBT 26; London, 1959) p. 42. 18 The only scholar who has read and commented on the TrShem besides Mingana, E. R. Goodenough, claims correctly that the thin veneer of Judaism in the TrShem discloses that the author did not relate his astrological beliefs to his Jewish faith; he writes, \"a Jew would seem to have believed in both Judaism and astrology but to have been content to join the two together thus loosely rather than try really to fuse them.\" See his Jewish Symbols in the Greco-Roman Period (New York, 1958) vol. 8, p. 199."},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"explicitly rejected19 ideas characteristic of the Treatise of Shem. And in the sixth week, in its fifth year, Abram sat up during the night on the first of the seventh month,20 so that he might observe the stars from evening until daybreak so that he might see what the nature of the year would be with respect to rain. And he was sitting alone and making observations; And a word came into his heart, saying: \"All of the signs of the stars and the signs of the sun and the moon are in the hand of the LORD. Why am I seeking? If he desires, he will make rain morning and evening, And if he desires he will not send (it) down; And everything is in his hand.\" (Jub 12:16-18) While Jubilees 12, of course, was not written against the Treatise of Shem, it was directed against the astrological claims that the zodiac determined yearly rainfall, an idea expressed, for example, in the Treatise at 5:1: \"And if the year begins in Leo: there will be spring rains, then the soil will be deprived of the north winds.\" The author clearly contradicts his astrological ideas when he affirms the older tradition that God is efficacious; he hears petitions and prayers for rain (8:3; 10:17; cf. 12:9). It is significant that the author refers to God only three times (8:3; 11:17; 12:9) and that twice he uses the phrase \"the living God.\" The author of the Treatise of Shem was apparently a Jew. Some hellenistic Jews consid­erably compromised ancient traditions as they became accommodated to foreign lands and customs. Diasporic Judaism, and even Palestinian Judaism, was not guided by an established orthodoxy. The Treatise of Shem significantly improves our perception of the variegated nature of intertestamental Judaism; mere possession of it should invalidate the recent claim that astrology in Judaism was never more than a Qumranite or sectarian aberration.21 Noticeably absent in this document are references to angels, a belief in immortality or a resurrection from the dead, and the various levels of heaven. No Jewish festivals are noted except Passover (1:8; 6:12) and the references to it may simply be another indication of the Egyptian provenance. The author (or a later copyist) may have attributed this document to Shem because he was the oldest son of Noah (Gen 10:21; cf. Jub 4:33), was greatly blessed and loved by his father 19 Other significant arguments against astrology are as follows: According to the author of the early chapters of IEn, astrology is an evil and demoniac idea since it was taught to men by one of the fallen angels, Baraqiyal (IEn 8:3). The third book of the SibOr (c. 2nd cent. B.C.) in 11. 220-36 praises righteous men who neither search the mystical meaning of the movements of the heavenly bodies nor are deceived by the predictions of Chaldean astrology. Philo of Alexandria (c. 25 B.C.-A.D. 45) attempted to refute the ideas of the astrologers and argued that Moses, although he apparently had a concept of the universe similar to that of the astrologers, taught that God alone is in control of creation, but he never suggested that the \"stars or their motions\" affected the fate of men {Mi#r 32). Josephus mentions that the veil of the Temple, which was composed of Babylonian tapestry, \"typified the universe\" and possessed \"mystic meaning,\" but although it \"portrayed a panorama of the heavens, the signs of the zodiac\" were not represented {War 5.212-14; cf. War 6.228-92). Later R. Johanan argued against Jewish interest in astrology by teaching that Israel is immune from planetary influence (b.Shab. 156a). The entire fourth book of Hippolytus' Ref is directed against astrology and speculations regarding the influence of the zodiac; his attention is directed against the belief that one's fate is determined by the house of the zodiac that is rising over the horizon at the moment of birth, an idea different from the thoughts in the TrShem but similar to those in 4QCryptic. For an informative account of the attempts by Octavian and others to control the volatile speculations of the astrologers, see R. MacMullen, \"Astrologers, Diviners, and Prophets,\" Enemies of the Roman Order (Cambridge, Mass.. 1966) pp. 128-62. For further discussion see HTR 70 (1977) 183-200. 20 I.e. Tishri, the beginning of the Jewish year. \"There are four 'New Year' days: on the 1st of Nisan ... on the 1st of EIul ... on the 1st of Tishri is the New Year for [the reckoning of] the years [of foreign kings], of the Years of Release and Jubilee years, for the planting [of trees] and for vegetables; and the 1st of Shebat . . .\" (RH 1.1). H. Danby, The Mishnah (Oxford, 1933) p. 188. Danby notes that Tishri \"is alone spoken of throughout the rest of the tractate as 'the New Year.' \" 21 M. R. Lehman, using the outmoded paradigm of \"normative Judaism,\" claims solely on the basis of 4QCryptic and an enigmatic passage in the Talmud that \"astrology never got a permanent foothold in Judaism, since it was. from the beginning, fraught with sectarian overtones.\" See his \"New Light on Astrology in Qumran and the Talmud,\" RQ 32 (1975) 599-602. It should be added that astrology did make a \"foothold in Judaism\" as demonstrated by R. P. Hanina b. Hama: \"The stars make one wise, the stars make one rich, and there are stars for Israel\" (b.Shab. 156a). For an excellent survey of astrology in Judaism see A.

He receives as an inheritance \"the middle of the earth\" (Jub 8:12-30), which included the Promised Land and the three dwellings of God, the garden of Eden, Mount Sinai, and Mount Zion (Jub 8:18f.). Moreover, according to some ancient traditions, the angels taught Noah every kind of medicine and the cure for diseases; he in turn wrote all these things in a book and gave it to Shem (Jub 10:10-14). These traditions could easily have caused a Jew to attribute the ideas contained in the present document to Shem.22 Relation to canonical books Intermittently throughout the preceding discussion the Treatise of Shem has been compared with the Old Testament. The few parallels emphasize a difference in perspective. For example, the Old Testament prophets prophesy about what is soon to happen because of God's involvement in history; the author of the Treatise of Shem predicts events potentially far distant in the future because of the effect of the zodiac upon earthly cycles. The Old Testament writers saw the stars as obeying God's commands and displaying his glory;23 the author of the Treatise of Shem claimed the heavenly bodies caused events to happen on the earth. One passage in the New Testament24 receives new illumination because of the discovery of Jewish interest in astrology prior to Jesus and his followers. Matthew 2:2 mentions that the wise men (magoi) came to Judea to see a newly born King of the Jews because \"we have seen his star in the East ...\" (RSV). An alternative and better translation is \"we saw his star as it rose ...\" (JB) or \"we saw his star when it came up in the east...\" (GNMM).25 With either translation, and especially with the latter, it is conceivable that the author of this tradition—either Matthew himself or more probably26 another Jewish Christian before him— was influenced by astrological predictions. So strong were the astrological overtones in this verse (and Mt 2:9) that some early Christians claimed it proved \"that astrology may be depended on.\"27 Eventually St. John Chrysostom in the fourth and St. Augustine in the fifth century were forced to direct one or more sermons against an astrological interpretation of Matthew 2:1-12. St. Augustine became embroiled in a heated controversy and the influence of his opponents can be surmised by the words he used: * 'This star confounded the meaningless reckonings and prognostications of the astrologers when it showed these worshippers of stars 22 Shem was also accorded a significant place in holy history in later Jewish writings; cf. N. Pavoncello, \"La scuola di Shem e di Ever nella tradizione rabbinica,\" RevistB 27 (1979) 325-29. The TrShem is significantly different from other documents attributed to Shem. Most notable among these are the gnostic Paraphrase of Shem (Nag Hammadi Codex VII, 1) and the medieval Kitdb al-lkhtildjdt (T-S A45.21), or the \"Book of Twitches\" composed by Shem (ed. by S. Hopkins, A Miscellany of Literary Pieces from the Cambridge Genizah Collections [Cambridge University Library Genizah Series 3; Cambridge, 1978] pp. 69-71). 23 Cf. especially Isa 40:26; 45:12; Pss 19:1, 5f.; 148:3. The concept reappears in the Pseudepigrapha: 2Bar 3:34f.; IEn 18:13-16; 21:1-6; 41:5; 86:1-6; 4Ezra 6:3. I am indebted here to W. Foerster, \"aster, astron,\" TDNT 1 (1964) 503-5. King Josiah deposed the priests \"who offered sacrifice to Baal, to the sun, the moon, the constellations and the whole array of heaven\" (2Kgs 23:5, JB). 24 Rev 4:6-8, which describes the four living creatures that surround the heavenly throne, and Rev 12:1, which describes a woman crowned with \"twelve stars,\" are usually interpreted in terms of the zodiac. The first passage represents the four main zodiacal constellations (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius), the second portrays the twelve signs of the zodiac. See R. H. Charles, The Revelation of St. John, 2 vols. (ICC; Edinburgh, 1920, repr. 1963 and 1966) vol. 1, pp. 122f., 315f. 25 The GNMM is the translation behind E. Schweizer's The Good News According to Matthew, trans. D. E. Green (Atlanta, 1975). 26 Schweizer correctly sees two traditions behind Mt 2:1-12, one that emphasized the struggle between Herod and the newborn king and another that had as its motif \"the homage offered by the astrologers.\" These traditions were of different origin, and \"Matthew was probably the first to link the two traditions.\" Good News According to Matthew, pp. 36f. Another careful argument for the independent prior character of the tradition about the wise men has been published recently by F. Zinniker, Probleme der sogenannten Kindheitsgeschichte bei Manlius (Freiburg, 1972) cf. especially p. 167. 27 The quotation from these Christians is preserved by St. John Chrysostom; Homilies on the Gospel of Saint Matthew, trans.

Paul and R. E. Brown,30 does not totally exhaust the rich complexities in Matthew. It is no longer justifiable to approach Matthew 2 with the assumption that all Jews believed the stars intervened in man's destiny only in line with God's will; and it is unwise to presuppose that Matthew's wise men must be pagans because of their astrological beliefs.31 Astrological speculation could well have been linked with Jesus' birth by Jewish Christians before Matthew wrote.32 At his birth (or close to it)33 Jupiter and Saturn over a period of eight months were in conjunction three times in Pisces, the Hebrew zodiacal sign and the sign of the last days.34 Later Jewish and Jewish-Christian astrologers could well have noted the significance: Jupiter, the \"star\"35 that denoted kingship, was linked with Saturn, the \"star\" that represented Israel (or Palestine).

Paul, who eventually reaffirms the ancient tradition that the wise men were disciples of Zarathustra {L'Evangile de I'enfance, pp. 104-12, 116-25). R. A. Oriti incorrectly states, \"Since the Jews were not believers in astrology, they would attribute no special significance to the chance grouping of planets.\" \"The Star of Bethlehem,\" Griffith Observer 39 (1975) 9-14. The wise men are called Zoroastrians in Leeds Arabic MS No. 184 (c. 18th cent.), which is a fou. h version (Arabic four) of the oriental form of the Tiburtine Sibyl: \"The Zoroastrians shall come from the east, bearing gifts for him\" (p. 293). While there is no literary dependence between this text and the TrShem, there are some interesting similarities. Note, for example, vs. 9: \"The ninth sun is the ninth age, in which the Lion Cub shall come out of the west, and rebuild the earth's ruins, and the world shall be prosperous and the fruit of the earth shall multiply ...\" (pp. 302f\\). See E. Y. Ebied and M. J. L. Young, \"An Unrecorded Arabic Version of a Sibylline Prophecy,\" Orientalia Christiana Periodica 43 (1977) 279-307. 32 A cuneiform tablet, the Celestial Almanac of Sippar, predicted the triple conjunction of Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars in 7 B.C. Hence, astrologers and astronomers eagerly anticipated the celestial wonder. See the discussion and bibliographical notes in E. Stauffer, Jesus and His Story, trans. R. and C. Winston (New York, 1960); especially see pp. 32-34, 217. 33 Jesus' birth, according to critical research, is placed between 8 and 6 B.C; in 7 B.C there was a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn three times (thanks to the optical illusion of retrograde motion) in Pisces: in late May and early June, throughout October, and in early December. See the astronomical tables published by W. D. Stahlman and O. Gingerich, Solar and Planetary Longitudes for Years -2500 to +2000 by 10-Day Intervals (Madison, Wise, 1963) p. 306. Shortly after this threefold conjunction, on February 19, 6 B.C. Mars was in conjunction with Saturn, \"but the Magi, though they were expecting it, probably were prevented from observing it because the sun had by now moved into the area and all three planets were almost certainly lost in the glare of sunset.\" R. S. Knapp, A Star of Wonder (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1967) p. 15. For assistance in this research I am grateful to R. S. Knapp and J. P. Charlesworth, both of the Morehead Planetarium. 34 W. Sinnott claims that Matthew's star was probably the conjunction of Venus with Jupiter on June 17, 2 B.C, which occurred in Leo (a lion according to early Semitic records, and Judah is called a \"lion's whelp\" in Gen 49:9f.) with the planets equidistant from the star Regulus (prince), which always remains between Leo's feet (cf. Gen 49:9f.). See his \"Thoughts on the Star of Bethlehem,\" Sky and Telescope (December 1968) 384-86. Also see the response to Sinnott by the editor in chief, C. A. Federer, who offers the opinion \"that Ensign Sinnott's results make the Star of Bethlehem more plausible astronomically than it has seemed heretofore.\" \"Rambling Through December Skies,\" Sky and Telescope (December 1968) 390, 396. 35 Mt uses the noun aster, \"star,\" not astron, \"star, constellation.\" Ignatius (Eph 19.2) also uses the noun aster. R. Rodman argues that aster should not be taken to denote a conjunction of planets because astron would more appropriately represent \"conjunction\" and planes \"planet.\" (\"A Linguistic Note on the Christmas Star,\" Griffith Observer 40 [1976] 8f.) Astron, however, does not mean \"conjunction,\" and aster does mean \"planet\" only when combined with planes, as Rodman reports: planes aster means \"wandering star.\" But Mt, who was a Semite not a Greek, did not originate the account (see n. 21), rather he adapted the earlier tradition in line with his pervasive emphasis upon the fulfillment of messianic prophecies. One should remember that aster is generic and might even represent a \"comet,\" since Origen, who obviously wrote in Gk., claimed that the star was \"a new star\" (astera en te anatole kainon) like a comet or meteor. He claims that Chaeremon the Stoic's Treatise on Comets shows that comets occasionally did portend good things (Contra Celsum, bk. 1, 58f.). It seems unlikely, however, that aster denoted the conjunction of two planets; it is more likely that the author of the tradition, if he used aster, was focusing upon the unique behavior of Saturn, the star of Israel."},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"seems clear: In the last days a great king shall be born in Israel.36 Proof of astrological speculations among the Jews prior to the birth of Christianity, as now demonstrated by the recovery of the Treatise of Shem, coupled with the indisputable fact of a \"most unusual celestial display\"37 near the time of Jesus' birth by no means prove that Matthew 2 preserves reliable historical information; but it is now more difficult to claim that Matthew's star was created purely out of a myth. Cultural importance It is significant that the Treatise of Shem was composed about the time that the vernal equinox (the traditional beginning of the year, the start of spring) moved from Aries to Pisces, where it has been ever since, although it is about to move into Aquarius. This change, G. de Santillana has argued, would have evoked strong \"astrological emotion\" since one age was succeeding another.38 It is certainly not clear, however, that this phenomenon was perceived or comprehended in antiquity. If it was, then the Treatise of Shem would be an unparalleled record of this monumental shift, the Precession of the Equinoxes. The cultural importance of this document is even greater if, indeed, it reflects the unexpected demise of Antony and Cleopatra at Actium and their subsequent suicides in Alexandria. It becomes the first link in that literary chain of classics that features and exposes the paradigm of Antony and Cleopatra's paradoxical lives and love. It would be difficult to overestimate the influence upon our culture of such masterpieces as Plutarch's Life of Marcus Antonius, Shakespeare's The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra, Dryden's All for Love, and Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra.

Collective nouns representing animals in Syr. can take singular or plural verbs (cf. T.

Mingana claimed that there4 'are evidently some words missing here,\" and left the sentence open: \"And there will be at the beginning of the year [. . .]\" The line in the MS ends with \"in the begin­ning of the year\" and the author refers frequently to the \"beginning,\" \"middle,\" and \"end\" of the year; it is possible that a line or more has been omitted inadvertently due to the repetition of identical words. In fact, three lines below this one the last word is \"year.\" Another line could have ended in \"year\" and the copyist could have inadvertently omitted it as his eye returned to \"the year\" which ended it, thinking it was the one he had just copied. This error is one of the most frequently committed by Syriac scribes. Nevertheless, there is no evidence in the MS that some words have been omitted. Scribes corrected this MS (cf. n. e, ch. 4, and d, ch. 8), and the phrase can be translated sensibly to refer to what precedes. There is, therefore, no need to suppose that some words are missing. b. Mingana misread the MS: \"in some places.\" See n. h, ch. 5. c. Lit. \"will have miseries.\" Mingana: \"will be in distress and sickness.\" d. Linking a plain in Transjordan with a region in northwest Asia Minor seems odd. Note that in 1:11 Hauran is joined in thought with Damascus.

ROBINSON The Apocryphon of Ezekiel has not survived intact; four fragments preserved in secondary sources and one small fragment of the apocryphon itself, which is also quoted by Clement of Alexandria, are all that remain. Of these five fragments, the only one long enough to require summarization here is the story of the lame man and the blind man found in rabbinic literature and in the writings of Epiphanius. In this story a certain king invites everyone in his kingdom except two cripples, the lame man and the blind man, to attend a great feast. Understandably offended, the two cripples devise a plan to get even. The lame man braids a rope and, throwing it to the blind man, leads the latter to himself. He then climbs onto the shoulders of the blind man. Thus equipped with the eyes of the lame man and the legs of the blind, the two men enter the garden of the king and, presumably, tear down the fruit trees or, as in the Hebrew version, eat the choice fruit. When the deed is discovered, the lame man and the blind man are brought before the king. Each appeals to his particular infirmity as proof that he could not be the guilty party. Then the wise king has the lame man placed on the shoulders of the blind, and having thus demonstrated how the deed was performed, orders them to be flogged together before him. As they are flogged, each accuses the other of being primarily responsible for the crime. The moral which is drawn from the story is that body and soul, like the lame man and the blind man, cooperate in all the deeds performed in mortality; hence, at the judgment of God, body and soul must be reunited in a resurrection so that both may receive their just deserts. Texts The texts for fragment 1, the story of the lame man and the blind, are found in Epiphanius' Against Heresies 64.70, 5-17 (ed. Holl), and in rabbinic literature at Sanhedrin 91a, b (attributed to R. Judah ha-Nasi, c. A.D. 200), Leviticus Rabbah 4:5 (attributed to R. Ishmael, c. A.D. 130), and in the Mekhilta on Exodus 15:1 (also attributed to R. Ishmael). The translations below are taken from K. Holl's edition of Epiphanius1 and from the Soncino Hebrew-English edition of the Babylonian Talmud.2 Fragment 2 is found in several places, the earliest of which is the text of 1 Clement 8:2f. The translation of fragment 2 below is taken from K. Lake's edition of 1 Clement.3 Other versions of this fragment are found in Clement of Alexandria (Paid 1.10),4 and in the Coptic Exegesis on the Soul from Nag Hammadi.5 There is also an allusion to this passage in Quis dives salvetur 39.2 by Clement of Alexandria.6 1 Epiphanius: Ancoratus und Panarion, ed.

The fourth surviving fragment of the Apocryphon of Ezekiel is cited in no fewer than thirty-two secondary sources, which date from the second century A.D. well into the Middle Ages. The earliest and most important of these citations is found in Justin Martyr's Dialogue with Trypho 47.5, from which the translation below is taken.12 Slightly varying versions of fragment 5 are found in Clement of Alexandria (Strom 1.9),13 in Origen (Homilies on Jeremiah 18.9),'4 and in the Manichaean Psalmbook (Psalm 239:5f.).15 The sole surviving fragment of a manuscript of the Apocryphon of Ezekiel itself, as opposed to a citation of the apocryphon found in secondary sources, contains this fifth fragment. This manuscript fragment was identified and edited by C. Bonner from among the Chester Beatty Papyri.16 This fragment confirms that the citation of Clement is from the apocryphon; the translation is based on the fragmentary text of the papyrus and the complete text of Clement. Original language It is extremely hazardous to speculate on the original language of compositions that are no longer extant or that are known by only a few fragments. Bearing this in mind, one may, however, hypothesize that Greek and Hebrew are the most likely candidates for the original language of the apocryphon. On the one hand, Greek might be suggested by the fact that it was so widely spoken in the intertestamental period and by the fact that the only surviving manuscript fragment of the apocryphon is written in Greek. On the other hand, Hebrew might be suggested by the appearance of a Hebrew version of fragment 1 in the rabbinic literature and by the statement of Josephus that there were in his day two books of Ezekiel, the natural inference being that he considered these companion pieces, and hence written in the same language, i.e. Hebrew. However, both of these possibilities are threads too slender to bear much weight, and in the absence of more manuscript evidence, the question of the original language of the Apocryphon of Ezekiel should be left open. Date The Apocryphon of Ezekiel cannot be dated later than the end of the first century A.D. 1 Clement (c. A.D. 95) uses the Apocryphon as one of its sources, and the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus noted (Ant 10.5.1) that Ezekiel had left behind two books, of which we may assume one to have been the apocryphon. The earliest possible date cannot be determined as precisely, although the conjecture of K. Holl17 and J.-B. Frey,18 placing the composition of the document between 50 B.C. and A.D. 50, has been generally accepted. rather than a citation. Influence from ApocEzek can be seen throughout this chapter: (1) the presence of the term \"blacker\" in what appears to be a quotation from Isa 1:18, which destroys the synonymous parallelism; (2) the emphasis upon repentance \"with the whole heart\"; and (3) the use of the appellation \"Father\" (infrequently used in the treatise except on the lips of Jesus) in close conjunction with the theme of repentance. 7 GCS 17, p. 66, I. 25. 8 PL 2. col. 836. 9 See M.

Although some of the fragments may indicate a Christian redaction of the apocryphon, there is little doubt that the original was Jewish in character.19 Historical importance Historically, the Apocryphon of Ezekiel is another example of an intertestamental text that, though Jewish in origin, has been preserved, albeit fragmentarily, only in Christian sources. This common phenomenon serves to remind the reader that intertestamental Judaism was not nearly as monolithic in its theology nor as homogenous in its literary tradition as the rabbinic Judaism of a slightly later time. Moreover, the wide popularity of the Apoc­ryphon of Ezekiel in early Christian sources witnesses a certain latitude in the concept of canon that became less common as the Church became less and less diversified in later centuries. The transmission history of fragment 4 illustrates how an apt saying, even from an apocryphal source, could find its way into general usage and become a Christian maxim long after its origins had been forgotten.20 Theological importance The first and longest fragment is an eloquent statement of the doctrine of the resurrection and of the judgment of God in the end-time. In both the Hebrew and Greek versions the message is clear: God will reunite body and spirit in a future judgment in order to dispense justly either reward or punishment. The resurrection envisioned is a literal reunion of the departed spirit with its former body. Man is neither a spirit in a body, nor a body with a spirit, but both a body and a spirit. Without both, the identity of the individual is incomplete and he cannot be judged. Also, the individual is clearly judged as an individual and not as a member of a people or of a community. In both the Hebrew and Greek versions the criterion for judgment is the deeds performed in mortality. However, the Greek version may reflect the belief that those who were in the service of the king in the parable (Christians?) are exempt from the judgment, or that only those who are not enlisted in the king's service would perform deeds worthy of condemnation, for the Greek version has no judgment of those invited to the banquet. Relation to canonical books It has been suggested by some scholars that the Apocryphon of Ezekiel never existed as a separate document, but only as an expanded version of, or Midrash on, canonical Ezekiel.21 If we were dealing only with fragments 2, 4, and 5, this suggestion would be very attractive, for these fragments do bear some similarity to passages from the canonical Ezekiel. However, it is very difficult to understand where fragments 1 and 3 would fit in such an expanded or paraphrased text, for they are totally unlike anything in the canonical Ezekiel. Also, Epiphanius explicitly identifies fragment 1 as coming from 44Ezekiel's own apocryphon.\"22 Moreover, any theory that the Apocryphon of Ezekiel is merely an expanded or paraphrased Christian version of canonical Ezekiel must ignore the notice in Josephus (Ant 10.5.1) that ™DBSup, vol. 1, cols. 458-60. 19 Denis, Introduction, p. 190; K.-G. Eckart, \"Das Apokryphon Ezechiel,\" JSHRZ 5.1 (1974) 47, 49; Holl, Aus Schrifi und Geschichte, pp. 93f.; T. Zahn, Forschungen zur Geschichte des neutestamentlichen Kanons und der altkirchlichen Literatur 6 (1900) 311; J.-B. Frey, DBSup, vol. 1, col. 460. For the opposite opinion, cf. M. R. James, \"The Apocryphal Ezekiel,\" JTS 15 (1914) 243, and A. Resch, Agrapha. pp. 381-84. 20 A. Baker, JBL 87 (1968) 285. J. Jeremias disputes the claim that Justin has improperly attributed this saying to Jesus (Unknown Sayings of Jesus, pp. 86f.; the second English edition cited in Bibliography was translated from the substantially revised third German edition of 1963). He proposed that the Liber graduum preserved the most original form of the saying and attributed it clearly to Jesus, just as Justin did. The attribution to Ezekiel appears later only as a result of a change in the form of the citation that brings it into close alignment with Ezek 33:12-20. 21 See J. Danielou, The Theology of Jewish Christianity (London, 1964) pp. 105-7, and more recently, Baker, JBL 87 (1968) 285f. Resch (Agrapha, pp. 381-84) suggests that the fragments are actually from a Christian reworking of the canonical Ezekiel. 22 Epiphanius, AdvHaer 64.70."},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"the Jewish historian knew of two books attributed to that prophet. The five fragments presently extant and the testimony of Jewish and Christian writers in antiquity weigh heavily in favor of the separate existence of the Apocryphon of Ezekiel. A more detailed statement of its relationship to canonical literature must unfortunately await the discovery of a more complete text of the apocryphon. Relation to apocryphal books The Apocryphon of Ezekiel seems to have enjoyed a certain amount of popularity in the first centuries of the present era. Besides the numerous quotations from the apocryphon in the patristic literature, fragment 2 is quoted in the Exegesis on the Soul from the gnostic library at Nag Hammadi;23 fragment 3 is found in the Acts of Peter;24 and fragment 5 is found in the Manichaean Psalmbook.25 The Ascension of Isaiah may also have known the apocryphon, for in chapter 11, as the rumor of Mary's maternity is spread throughout Bethlehem, some affirm and some deny the report. This is quite reminiscent of fragment 3, especially as preserved by Epiphanius.26 The characterization of the Messiah's mother as a heifer probably finds its precedent in Jewish literature at 1 Enoch 90:37. Here Enoch symbolically represents the coming of a Messiah by the birth of a white bull. Our apocryphon has taken over this motif and has logically assumed that Enoch's white bull would have been born from a heifer. This motif of the heifer who bears the Messiah is taken up by the Church Fathers in later controversies over the virginity of Mary.27 SELECT BIBLIOGRAPHY Charlesworth, PMR, pp. 109f.

So come on, just as he did to us, let us 5.6 retaliate (against) him/' -But the other asked, \"In what way?\" #And he said, \"Let 7 us go into his garden and there destroy the things of the garden.\" •But he said, 8 \"But how can I, being lame and unable to crawl?\" »And the blind one spoke, \"What am I able to do myself, unable to see where I am going?

A NEW TRANSLATION AND INTRODUCTION BY O. S. WINTERMUTE If the calculations of Carl Schmidt are correct, only about one fourth of the text of the Apocalypse of Zephaniah has been preserved, with a lacuna of over one half of the text at the beginning.1 Even the text that survived is not continuous. There is preserved: (1) a short Greek quotation cited by Clement of Alexandria,2 (2) two pages of a Sahidic manuscript, and (3) eighteen pages of Akhmimic text, broken by a lacuna after page 12. Despite the fragmentary nature of the text, the genre and structure are quite obvious: It is an apocalypse; more specifically it shares the greatest number of literary features with other apocalyptic writings such as 1 Enoch, 2 Enoch, 3 Baruch, and The Apocalypse of Paul (cf. Nag Hammadi CG V, 2.).3 Each of these works contains the first-person account of a seer who is led through heavenly spheres by an angelic guide or guides and bears witness to the splendor of various heavenly glories (cf. TLevi and Ascenls) as well as terrifying scenes of sinners as they suffer the torment of their just punishment. Such writings normally have an episodic structure consisting of a series of short vignettes and dialogue strung together or set side by side with other independent literary units inside the loose framework of a \"cosmic journey.\" The isolated episodes or scenes that make up such a work are frequently complete and self-consistent. Consequently they are readily subject to modification. They may be expanded upon, abbreviated, omitted, or supplemented by the addition of new episodes. Thus various episodes or scenes within 1 Enoch have been assigned correctly to different authors from different periods of time. In 3 Baruch, which is a fairly straightforward trip through five heavens, the seer can pause along the way to include one digression on the tree (actually a grape vine) of Paradise and another on the Phoenix, as well as lesser concerns. In the case of 2 Enoch, a simple comparison of the translations of the two main Slavonic manuscripts illustrates how easily the separate scenes may be modified, abbreviated, expanded upon, or omitted without doing serious violence to the overall structure of the work. The Apocalypse of Paul, moreover, contains doublets that are found in the seer's journeys to the promised land and his subsequent visit to Paradise, suggesting that the writer drew into his account episodes from separate, overlapping sources. The Apocalypse of Zephaniah undoubtedly had a similar structure. Within the surviving fragments there are indications of repetition and overlapping. The sea of fire first appears in 6:1, but it is taken up again in 10:3, where the author describes the torment of the souls who sink in the sea. The punishment of sinners that is discussed in 10:4-9 is also the concern of the first eight lines of the Sahidic fragment. This type of literature is composed of self-contained scenes and episodes that are loosely 1 C. Schmidt, \"Der Kolophon des Ms. Orient. 7594 des Britischen Museums; eine Untersuchung zur Elias-Apokalypse,\" Sitzungsberichte der Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, pp. 312-21. Schmidt said that he was assisted in reconstructing the MS by Ibscher. 2 Strom 5.11.77. 3 This newly discovered text from Nag Hammadi CG V, 2 is also titled \"The Apocalypse of Paul,\" but it is a gnostic text which should not be confused with the previously cited apocalypse which has the same name. See n. 12 below."},{"pageNumber":551,"pageContent":"4 The pagination which is noted here is based on Schmidt's analysis of the text. See n. 1 above for bibliography. joined rather than tightly woven into a developing plot or interconnected sequence of events; hence, it is virtually impossible to guess what the initial forty-six pages4 of missing text contained. Most likely they recorded a general description of Zephaniah's cosmic travels, in which he saw both heavenly glories and the torments of hell. This rather safe conjecture is supported by the contrasting content of Clement's quotation about the fifth heaven and the Sahidic fragment's description of a tortured soul in Hades; both of these may have been located somewhere in the first half of the text. There is a positive aspect to the self-contained nature of the episodes: We can understand the surviving fragments of the Akhmimic text quite well, despite having only the most general understanding of what preceded it. The surviving text begins with a brief glimpse of angelic glory in the fifth heaven. After a lacuna of unknown length, the seer describes a vision of the scourging of a soul in Hades and his own terrified response. This is followed by an angelic exhortation to prevail over the accuser so that the seer might come up from Hades. Subsequently, the seer journeys with the angel of the Lord to a great broad place in which further visions begin. The Akhmimic manuscript contains the largest portion of surviving text. It may be divided into two major sections: (1) scenes from the travelogue, and (2) trumpet scenes. The travelogue describes the seer's movements, which introduce a new setting for the visions and dialogue that follow. The first travel notice is found at 2:1: \"Now I went with the angel of the Lord and he took me up (over) all my city.\" The scenes and dialogue from on high continue until 3:1, where the second travel notice begins with the sentence: \"The angel of the Lord said to me, 'Come, let me show you the place of righteousness.' And he took me up upon Mount Seir ...\" Other travel notices appear in 4:1, 5:1, 6:1, and 8:1, where the seer is transported by boat to the site of the trumpet scenes. Both the quotation cited by Clement and the Sahidic text (B8) contain similar travel notes. The author of the text used the travel notices to break up his travelogue into a number of episodes. If we count the brief introductory fragment dealing with burial, there are seven such episodes: 1. A brief fragment dealing with burial (ch. 1). 2. Scenes from some heavenly location above Jerusalem (ch. 2). Here the seer witnesses scenes of city life, discusses the nature of the continous light that shines with the righteous, and sees men in torment. 3. Scenes from Mount Seir (ch. 3). A vision of three men led by two angels provides the starting point for a dialogue in which the angel who accompanies the seer describes the manner in which angels record the good and evil deeds of men on a manuscript for the time of judgment. 4. Scenes outside the heavenly city (ch. 4). Here Zephaniah sees the terrifying angels who bring the souls of evil men to their eternal punishment. He prays for deliverance, and his petition is heard. 5. Scenes within the city (ch. 5). Here the seer's attention is centered on the gates and the city square. He also witnesses the transformation of his angelic guide. 6. Scenes from Hades (chs. 6f.). After turning back, Zephaniah observes a sea of fire. Subsequently he is confronted by the accuser, who has his manuscript of sins and short­comings, and Eremiel, who has a record of his good deeds. 7. Scene in a boat (ch. 8). At this point the seer puts on an angelic garment and joins the angelic host. The text ends with four trumpet scenes in which the episodes are introduced by a great angel who blows on a golden trumpet. The scenes appear in the following order: 1. The trumpet that heralds the seer's triumph over the accuser (ch. 9). This episode describes the seer's wish to embrace the angel, and the angel's conversation with Old Testament saints (Abraham, Isaac, etc.). 2. The trumpet that heralds the opening of heaven (ch. 10). In this episode the seer once again sees the fiery sea and the sinners who are tormented in it. He also sees bodies with hair and learns that the Lord provides body and hair. 3. The trumpet that calls the saints to intercessory prayer (ch. 11). In this scene, the seer sees a pious multitude interceding for those in torment; he is told that the pious assemble for prayer daily when the trumpet sounds."},{"pageNumber":552,"pageContent":"4. The trumpet that introduces a discussion of the end (ch. 12). The seer is told about a trumpet that will be blown in the future and hears about God's coming wrath. Title The title, the Apocalypse of Zephaniah, is not preserved in either of the surviving Coptic manuscripts, but the Sahidic manuscript contains the following statement: \"Truly, I, Zeph­aniah, saw these things in my vision.\" That statement together with the general content of the text is sufficient to classify the work as an Apocalypse of Zephaniah. It is not entirely clear from the content of the surviving portions of text why the author selected Zephaniah as the name of the seer. There are some parallels with the biblical Book of Zephaniah (cf. the nn. to the translation), but there are stronger parallels to Zechariah. The strongest parallels to Zephaniah in the surviving text are the concern for apostate priests in 3:2-6 (cf. Zeph 1:4) and the mention of God's coming wrath in 12:5-8 (cf. Zeph 1:14-18). Since a considerable amount of text is missing, it is quite probable that some lost episode near the beginning of the text provided a literary tie to the biblical prophet Zephaniah. Texts The text of the Apocalypse of Zephaniah has been partially preserved in two separate manuscripts that come from the White Monastery of Shenuda near Sohag. The earlier manuscript, which Steindorff dated at the end of the fourth century, is written in Akhmimic; the second manuscript, which Steindorff dated at the beginning of the fifth century, is written in Sahidic.5 Both manuscripts contain the text of the Apocalypse of Elijah as well as the Apocalypse of Zephaniah. Since the surviving text was purchased for European libraries leaf by leaf in two separate lots, there was originally a considerable amount of confusion about the identity and the content of these texts. The first group of papyri, which was purchased by Maspero between 1881 and 1884, contained not only two pages of the text of the Apocalypse of Zephaniah and twelve pages of the text of the Apocalypse of Elijah from the Sahidic manuscript but also fourteen pages of the Apocalypse of Elijah from the Akhmimic manuscript. That group of papyri is now in the Bibliotheque Nationale, inventory number Copte 135. A second lot of papyri from the same Akhmimic manuscript was uncovered in 1888 by K. Reinhardt. That collection consisted of sixteen pages of text: four from the Apocalypse of Zephaniah and twelve from the Apocalypse of Elijah. The papyri are now located in the Egyptological section of the State Museum of Berlin (German Democratic Republic), inventory number P 1862. The Greek text of Clement's citation has been published in Stahlin's edition of the Stromata, book 5.11.77.6 In addition to that quotation, there are three ancient witnesses who mention an Apocalypse of Zephaniah. Since they simply list the title without quoting from the document, there is some uncertainty about the relationship between the Coptic apocalypse and the work cited in those three lists. The first of these is the stichometry that was appended to the chronography of Nicephorus, Patriarch of Constantinople (806-15). That list, which may be several centuries older than the work of Nicephorus, includes a text entitled \"(The Book of the) Prophet Zephaniah,\" which contained 600 stichoi. The listing of the Zephaniah title immediately follows a work entitled \"(The Book of the) Prophet Elijah.\" The proximity of the works attributed to Zephaniah and Elijah in the stichometry and the fact that the works appear together in two separate Coptic manuscripts lend some support to the assumption that the Coptic works are to be identified with the ancient works mentioned in the stichometry. Nevertheless, it would appear that we do not have texts in the recension used for counting stichoi, since the calculations of Schmidt reveal that the text of Elijah is a bit short for the suggested 316 stichoi and the space needed for the text of Zephaniah is a bit more than the suggested 600 stichoi. The second ancient witness is the Synopsis scripturae sacrae of Pseudo-Athanasius, an 5 G. Steindorff, Die Apokalypsedes Elias, eine unbekannte Apokalypse undBruchstikke derSophonias-Apokalypse. 6 Clemens Alexandrinus, ed. O. Stahlin (GCS 15)."},{"pageNumber":553,"pageContent":"early list (perhaps 6th cent.) which Zahn treated as an independent tradition.7 The list of books in general is similar to that found in the stichometry of Nicephorus, but there is no stichometry provided. The works assigned to Elijah and Zephaniah appear in precisely the same order and with the same title that was given to them in the stichometry of Nicephorus. The third writing is the anonymous Catalogue of the Sixty Canonical Books. It lists the Apocalypse of Elijah, the Vision of Isaiah, and the Apocalypse of Zephaniah in that order. Here the works attributed to Elijah and Zephaniah are both designated as apocalypses, and the Vision of Isaiah is placed between them. Nevertheless, there is nothing in this listing of the two works that prevents their being identified with the parallel works mentioned in the previous lists. In fact, the probability lies with their being the same. It has generally been assumed that the ancient lists refer to the same work cited by Clement. Be that as it may, a more important question to consider is the relationship between Clement's citation and the Coptic texts. There are details in the quotation that both parallel and contradict data in the Coptic fragments. The most striking parallel is that both quotations deal with angels and describe them as singing hymns before God (as in the Ascenls). Contradictory features are most noticeable in the description of the deity; he is called \"the ineffable most high God\" in the Clement citation, but the \"Lord Almighty\" in the Coptic text. The \"Holy Spirit\" is mentioned in Clement's quotation, but not in the Coptic fragments. The quotation also assigns the spirit a role in transporting the seer; the Coptic fragments portray the seer traveling with the angel of the Lord. None of these contradictory features excludes the possibility that the quotation was taken from the same text as the Coptic fragments. Variation between Clement and the Coptic text may occur because Clement had a Christian recension of the text. Variation may also exist because the author of the apocalypse was following a different source in writing about the fifth heaven. Nevertheless, the majority of scholars appear to have followed the lead of E. Schiirer and assumed that this quotation was taken from the same Apocalypse of Zephaniah as that preserved in the surviving Coptic fragments.8 Thus the simplest hypothesis is to assume that there was a single ancient text entitled \"The Apocalypse of Zephaniah,\" which was attested by the four ancient witnesses listed above, and the Coptic fragments represent two different versions of that text. Original language It is generally assumed that the Coptic texts of the Apocalypse of Zephaniah are translations of a Greek original. There is no reason to suspect a pre-Greek stage of writing behind any of the surviving fragments. On the contrary, there is reason to believe that the writer did not fully understand Hebrew (compare the note regarding \"Eloe, Lord, Adonai, Sabaoth\" at 6:7). Date If the quotation by Clement of Alexandria is part of the apocalypse, then there are distinct limits for the time within which the text is to be dated. The earliest date for the Apocalypse of Zephaniah is sometime after the story of Susanna was circulated in Greek as part of the Book of Daniel. In 6:10 the author of the apocalypse appeals to the accounts of Susanna, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego as examples of God's power to deliver. Unfortunately, the date and even the original language of composition of the tale of Susanna are still matters of debate, but one could assume with some certainty that the text would be well known in Alexandria as part of the Book of Daniel during the first century B.C. The latest date is, of course, the time of Clement of Alexandria's Stromata. If we are correct in assuming that Clement accepted the work as that of the biblical prophet Zephaniah, it must have circulated long enough to have acquired that prestige. That would set the latest date sometime before the last quarter of the second century of the Christian era. As a result of the preceding arguments we can fix the date of this writing somewhere between 100 B.C. and A.D. 175. In commenting on the author's use of Mount Seir in 3:2 we have speculated about the historical period in which such a setting would be most apt to 7 T.

ScS.urer, Review of Die Apokalypse des Elias by Steindorff in TLZ 24 (1899) cols. 4-8."},{"pageNumber":554,"pageContent":"occur, concluding that motives for a pro-Edomite tradition may have persisted until the fall of Jerusalem in A.D. 70. If the author of this text is responsible for the tradition that places the seer's vision on Mount Seir, then he probably wrote before A.D. 70. Provenance We have no knowledge of the author apart from what we can deduce from his work. Although the claim is made that these are the visions of Zephaniah, reported in the first person, the well-known literary conventions of apocalyptic writing have led scholars to disregard that claim. Zephaniah is generally considered to be a pseudonym used by an anonymous writer who either believed that he was writing in the spirit of the biblical prophet Zephaniah or simply wished to enhance the prestige of his own ideas by invoking the name of an illustrious man of God. Whatever his name, it is fairly clear that the writer was a Jew. In the surviving portions of the text that deal with doctrines as basic as judgment for sin, intercessory prayer, and life after death, there is nothing distinctively Christian. The lack of Christian elements is even somewhat surprising when we remember that the manuscripts came from the library of a Christian monastery. They were preserved by monks, and in all probability copied by monks from earlier manuscripts that had been translated from Greek to Coptic within a Christian community. Over a period of one or two centuries of transmission by Christian scribes there are a number of ways that Christian concerns might have entered the document short of a conscious redaction of the text: (1) a Christian translator might have assumed that certain Greek terms in the document he was translating had a \"Christian\" meaning; (2) a Christian copyist might unconsciously have expanded a phrase or reformulated a sentence to agree with a familiar liturgical statement drawn from a Christian context; or (3) a monk might even have been tempted to add the name of Jesus or Paul to the list of righteous saints in Paradise. As a matter of fact, however, there is no clear example of any such modification of the text. The closest point of contact with Christian writings is found in the Akhmimic text. At 2:1-4 there is a close parallel to Matthew 24:40f. and Luke 17:34-36. At 6:11-15 there is a description of the angel Eremiel that has several features in common with descriptions of angels in Revelation. At 10:9 there is a quotation containing the word katechoumenos, which is used in a sense frequent in patristic texts. Nevertheless, each of these parallels may be rather easily explained as due to a common Jewish-Christian heritage. The most important point to observe is that in the surviving fragments there is no evidence of any Christian modification of any of the major theological concerns expressed in the work. Further study of the document by other scholars who are more knowledgeable about the sectarian divisions of ancient Judaism will be required before it is possible finally to set this apocalypse in its proper sociological context, but the following preliminary statements may be set forth. The author, who was concerned about the question of life after death, was not a Sadducee. His dualism is not compatible with that of Qumran. There is no zealot theology in evidence. He comes across as a gentle man, concerned for intercession on behalf of those in torment. He has concern for proper fulfillment of priestly ordinances (3:3f.) and times of daily prayer (1 l:5f.), but there is no reason to believe that the author himself was a priest. As a writer of apocalyptic, he shares features with a wide range of similar writings, a number of which are indicated in the accompanying notes, but his writing is also illuminated by referring to the Old Testament and to books within the Apocrypha such as Tobit, the Wisdom of Solomon, and the additions to Daniel. Since the author wrote in Greek, he may well have resided in a Jewish community outside of Palestine, somewhere in the hellenistic world. Evidence favoring Egypt is strongest. Two separate manuscripts have survived in Egypt. The Coptic (Budge) Apocalypse of Paul probably contains a quotation from a third Egyptian manuscript (see fragment B, n. c), attesting to the popularity of the text in Egypt. The only remaining Greek fragment of the work is the quotation by Clement of Alexandria. Consequently, it is reasonable to assume that the work was produced in that city. The comment regarding the weighing of good and evil (see ch. 8, n. b) also reminds one of an Egyptian motif, but such a comment could scarcely be decisive."},{"pageNumber":555,"pageContent":"Theological importance A basic theme present in all of the Coptic fragments is that of a divine judgment which faces all men. The Sahidic fragment, for example, contains a description of the scourging of a soul that was found in lawlessness. The same theme provides a connecting link joining the separate episodes in the travelogue. In 3:1 the angel of the Lord says, \"Come, let me show you the place of righteousness.\" If the translation \"place of righteousness\" is correct, it probably refers to the heavenly realm beyond the river of Hades, in which dwell the righteous men of old: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Enoch, Elijah, and David. In order to reach that place it is necessary for the seer to travel the route of a departed soul, which involves a harrowing confrontation with the accuser in Hades. The journey is carried out in stages. At the first stage, on Mount Seir, the seer learns how the evidence for and against a man is collected by angels who sit upon the gate. At the second stage, which is outside the heavenly city, he sees the terrifying angels who bring up the souls of ungodly men to their justly deserved eternal punishment. They cannot touch Zephaniah, however, because he is pure. The third stopping point is within the city before the gates, where fire is being cast forth. After withdrawing from there, the seer finds himself in Hades, where he encounters both Eremiel and the accuser. Eremiel is clearly a beneficent angel who cares for the souls imprisoned there, but the accuser, true to his title, seeks to condemn men before the Lord. Thus he functions as a prosecutor in the final judgment of men. It is also in Hades that the seer recognizes his own manuscripts, which contain testimony for and against him. When he finally prevails over the accuser and is judged victorious, he joins the ranks of angelic beings and summarizes his experience by saying, \"Now, moreover, my sons, this is the trial because it is necessary that the good and the evil be weighed in a balance\" (8:5). In the trumpet scenes there are further descriptions of punishment for sinful souls and mention of a final day \"when the Lord will judge,\" but the theme of intercessory prayer by the righteous becomes equally prominent. The concern of the righteous for those in torment appears in several passages. In 2:8f. Zephaniah sees the souls of men in torment and he offers a strong intercessory appeal which prompts the angel of the Lord to show him the place of righteousness. Along the way he observes two angels weeping over the three sons of Joatham because they have no righteous deeds to record. Nevertheless, this theme reaches its climax in the third trumpet scene, where we read of \"multitudes\" (including Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob) and \"all the righteous\" who intercede daily for those in torment. The intercessory prayers are addressed to a God who is capable of mercy (11:2), who remains with his saints, and has compassion on behalf of the world (2:9). A similar conception of God lies behind Zepaniah's prayer for his own deliverance. In 6:10 he appeals to the God whose faithfulness to his saints is illustrated by his salvation of Israel, Susanna, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. In 7:8 he appeals to God's mercy, which is \"in every place and has filled every space.\" A corollary of God's mercy and patience is his willingness to permit repentance, which could spare man the punishment he justly deserves. In the second trumpet scene the seer is shown the torment of sinful souls. When he has seen them, he asks, \"do they not have repentance here?\" The answer is \"yes,\" and the opportunity continues right up until \"the day when the Lord will judge.\" This text is written with a strong appeal for repentance. The two most extended and specific descriptions of the torment of sinners are found in the second trumpet scene and in the Sahidic fragment. Each time the description is closed with a comment about repentance. The comment from the second trumpet scene was discussed above and encourages repentance by emphasizing God's patience. The comment at the end of the torments described in the Sahidic fragment encourages repentance by warning that the soul is being tormented because it was \"found in its lawlessness\" and taken from its body before \"it attained to repenting.\" Despite the emphasis on God's mercy and his willingness to accept repentance, the author never forgets that God is the final judge, and that those found wanting will be subject to his wrath. The Akhmimic fragment is broken off after page 18, just as the author begins his final description of God's wrath. It is reasonable to assume that the four missing pages of the Akhmimic manuscript described the eschatological woes that are to be expected at the end of the age. God's glory is presented indirectly in the Coptic texts. His transcendence is preserved"},{"pageNumber":556,"pageContent":"throughout, but the splendor of his angel, Eremiel, is so great that the seer assumes that he is God and falls down to worship him. He is soon corrected by the angel, but one implication of the encounter is that if one could see him, God would be even more glorious than his great angel. In the quotation preserved by Clement, the angelic thrones in the fifth heaven are described as being \"sevenfold more (brilliant) than the light of the rising sun.\" By implication, the glory of God, who is far above the fifth heaven, is beyond description, a view explicit in the name for God: \"the ineffable most high God\" (fragment A). In contrast to Clement's quotation, the Akhmimic text refers to God as \"Lord Almighty\" [pjaeis pantokrator = Gk. kurios pantokrator). This Greek phrase is consistently used in the Septuagint to render the Hebrew Yahweh S'bcPdt, the \"Lord of Hosts.\" In the pre-exilic period this expression identified Yahweh as the God of the Armies (Hosts) of Israel, but by the time of the Exile \"the Hosts\" were identified with heavenly beings (cf. Isa 13:4f.). Thus it is natural in a text that places so much emphasis on the angelic hosts to confront the phrase \"Lord of Hosts.\" The angelology was very important for the author's understanding of the divine world. God is everywhere assumed to be an absolutely sovereign monotheistic deity; yet the author's angelology allows him to deal with data that is moderately dualistic. There are basically two types of angels: (1) beautiful angels, who praise God and assist righteous men, and (2) ugly angels, who are sent to terrify evil men, transport their souls to eternal punishment, and torment them. The ugly angels are not described as demons or evil angels but as \"servants of all creation\" (4:6), and hence servants of the God of all creation, the pantokrator. The ugliest angel is \"the accuser,\" but there is nothing to suggest that he is either a fallen angel or a lord of demons. His task remains much the same as that of Satan in the Book of Zechariah, a document that extensively influenced the author of this apocalypse. One of the important tasks of the angels in the Akhmimic text is to watch men and record every deed, both good and bad. Ultimately the writer is dealing with the omniscience of God, the righteous judge, who knows our every deed, but he deals with it in a very homely figure. Ugly angels write down all the evil deeds of men and take them to the accuser, who records them in order to accuse men before God. The beautiful angels write down all the good deeds of the righteous and give them to the great angel—Zephaniah's guide—and he takes them to God, who enrolls them in the Book of the Living. In this mode of operation we can see two groups of angels serving in different camps. One group works for the great angel and the other works for the accuser. The great angel and the accuser appear to be on a level of parity before the Lord Almighty. A similar picture may be drawn from the scene in Hades, where Eremiel, the guardian of souls, appears vis-a-vis the accuser of souls. There are striking parallels between the structure presented here and similar views that appear in the Qumran Manual of Discipline (1QS 3.13-4.26), where God created two spirits to govern the affairs of men: a spirit of truth and a spirit of falsehood. The significant difference, however, is that the ugly angels in the Apocalypse of Zephaniah are not commissioned to deceive men or to contribute to their downfall; they merely report it. The anthropology of the text has already been touched upon in dealing with theology and angelology. Here we may summarize. There are two ways open to men. One leads to enrollment in the Book of the Living (9:2), investiture in angelic garments (8:3), participation in angelic liturgy, and communion with the righteous, including the patriarchs, Enoch, Elijah, and David. The other way leads to eternal punishment (4:6f.). Every man is judged on the basis of his earthly deeds, and the righteous are delivered from Hades. Repentance is capable of changing the ultimate destiny of man. In all of this, man is represented as being free to make moral choices. He is not deceived or misled by evil spirits. On the contrary, there is evidence that the angels and the righteous continually seek to intercede with prayers and weeping on behalf of the fallen. Relation to canonical books Inasmuch as the Apocalypse of Zephaniah was written within a Jewish community, the author was familiar with the Old Testament and also expected his readers to be. It seems likely that he was familiar with the Pentateuch, prophets, and a number of the writings. The edition of Daniel that he used contained the story of Susanna. At 2:5 the description of a drop suspended from a bucket is probably dependent on Isaiah 40:15."},{"pageNumber":557,"pageContent":"Elsewhere, the author's use of the Old Testament is less specifically related to a particular text. He knows a number of epithets for God (6:7), the names of patriarchs (11:4; 9:4), heroes (6:10; 9:4), and the prophet Zephaniah (fragment B, 7). He also mentions Psalms (1:2) and the Book of the Living (3:7; 9:2; cf. Ps 69:28). The manner in which the dialogue between the prophet and his angelic interpreter is described follows the model found in Zechariah 1-6. The use of such data does not suggest that the author was a particularly careful student of the Scriptures who would rank with Paul, Philo, or the author of Jubilees. His knowledge is the casual sort available to a layman in the Jewish community. He is not interested in either studying the Scriptures directly or using them to support his theological position. The Old Testament simply provides him with a literary model for a portion of the angelic discourse, a number of well-known characters, a few ethical concerns, and incidental descriptive details. The author's limited use of the Old Testament is determined by his concern for postmortem judgment of souls, a concern virtually unmentioned in the Old Testament. Conversely, many significant concerns of the Old Testament are barely noted by the author. From the Pentateuch he is familiar with the phrase \"commandments and ordinances\" (3:4), but the phrase is split up so that the \"commandment\" is that of a priest Joatham, and the ordinances are from the Lord. The writer mentions the sons of Israel (7:7), but there is no mention of covenant, election, or land. He lists the patriarchs (9:4), but treats them merely as examples of pious men who were saved. He mentions God's mighty act of saving Israel from Pharaoh (6:10), but reveals no theological feeling for sacred history. The historical texts of the Old Testament have little interest for our author. He mentions David and Elijah simply as examples of holy men. He is somewhat more interested in the prophets, but both Zephaniah, who appears as the central figure in the apocalypse, and Zechariah, whose angelic dialogue serves as a model, are portrayed here, not as messengers of God's judgment or blessing, but as apocalyptic seers to their own age. The author's interest in angels, thrones, and apocalyptic judgment represents a more direct influence from the later Old Testament collection of writings, particularly Daniel and Psalms. The sins of omission that are listed on the seer's manuscript (7:3-8) are expressed in a form (i.e. \"If I did not . . .\") reminiscent of Job 31:16, 20. Both Job and the present text ultimately reflect the \"Negative Confessions,\" which are found in the Egyptian Book of the Dead, confessions to be made in the underworld at the judgment of the soul. The ethical concern for the widow and orphan (7:4f.) is found throughout the Old Testament (Deut 24:17; Isa 1:17; Job 31:16f.), and so is the mention of prayer and fasting (Judg 20:26; IKgs 21:9; Ezra 8:21), but the concern for turning to the sons of Israel reflects a post-exilic setting when life within a non-Jewish environment has singled out the children of Israel as a distinctive group among the nations for whom the pious express continual concern. Although the author of the present apocalypse has no interest in Nehemiah's political hopes for his people, he accepts the model of piety expressed in Nehemiah 1:4-6. In that passage Nehemiah is described as engaging in daily fasting and intercessory prayer for the children of Israel. Since there is little reason to believe that the present text was influenced by the New Testament, any parallels that occur are due to borrowing from a common milieu or a New Testament dependence on the present work. One of the most striking parallels is the seer's vision of two women grinding at a mill (2:3; cf. Mt 24:41). In that case, we are probably dealing with a well-known proverbial expression that was used by both the author of the present apocalypse and the evangelist. At 6:14f. there is a significant parallel to Revelation 19:10 (cf. 22:8f.). In both cases the seer falls down to worship an angel, and in both cases he is told not to worship the angel because he is not God. The context in which the adoration occurs in the present text is clear and logical. The seer was so awed by the splendor of the angel Eremiel that he mistook him for God. The author may have wished to indicate the surpassing majesty of God by suggesting that what might appear to men to attain the level of divine glory does not rise above the level of angelic splendor. The motif is repeated twice in Revelation (19:10; 22:8f.) in a context that is less clear. The angel who appears there describes himself as merely a fellow servant of the seer. The New Testament author may be dependent on a tradition that wishes to combat the worship of angels. In the Apocalypse of Zephaniah the angel who is worshiped is both identified and described"},{"pageNumber":558,"pageContent":"(6:11-15) in a passage that is strikingly similar to Revelation 1:13-18. The passage is obviously based on the description of a figure appearing in Daniel 10:5-14. The fact that the figure in Daniel is not identified undoubtedly generated a considerable amount of speculation. His legs are burnished bronze like those of the divine figure described in Ezekiel 1:27. He also claims to have been aided by Michael in resisting the Persians. It would appear from the description that Daniel saw either God or one of his highest angels. Whoever seeks to solve the problem of Daniel's vision must decide that issue, and if he decides that it is an angel he is then obliged to try to identify him. In the present text the issue is resolved when Zephaniah encounters the same figure that Daniel saw and identifies him as Eremiel, denying that he is the Lord Almighty. The author, or the source on which he relies, has both edited and expanded Daniel's vision at points. He eliminates Daniel's reference to the figure as a man and also the notice of his linen garment because he is not interested in his human features. He adds a notice that his face was shining like the sun and reports that he is responsible for those imprisoned in the abyss and Hades. What is surprising is to find the two added details in Revelation 1:11-18. There are, of course, differences in the vision that is preserved in Revelation. The human features of Daniel's figure have been retained because the Christian tradition has identified the man in Daniel 10:5 with the Son of Man in Daniel 7. The Christian tradition is probably also responsible for providing the figure in Revelation 1:11-18 with white hair, a portrayal taken from the description of the Ancient of Days in Daniel 7. Despite the differences, however, the descriptions of Eremiel and the figure of the Son of Man in Revelation are strikingly similar. The figures also share a benevolent concern for the souls in Hades. On the basis of the parallels, it is reasonable to assume that the Apocalypse of Zephaniah bears witness to a Jewish tradition that portrays Eremiel, the good angel of Sheol, in imagery based on Daniel 10:5-12, which was subsequently expanded. When the Christians began to identify the figure in Daniel 10:5-7 with the Son of Man, they used that expanded description of Eremiel to portray the risen Christ in his role as one who has power over death and Sheol. Relation to apocryphal books The Apocalypse of Zephaniah is dependent upon a tradition of apocalyptic writing that is concerned with demonstrating God's justice and mercy by permitting a seer to witness scenes of postmortem judgment and places of blessing prepared for the righteous. One of the earliest of these writings is found in 1 Enoch 21-25, a portion of \"The Book of Watchers,\" which Milik dates \"towards the middle of the third century B.C.\"9 Subsequent treatments of the same theme in Jewish and Christian circles involved the seer's ascent through three, four, seven, eight, or ten heavens to the throne of God. As Bousset has shown in his study of Die Himmelsreise der Seek, later elaborations of the form involved many additional details, such as the removal of earthly garments and investiture with heavenly ones, sacramental anointing, and magical defense against demons who threaten the seer's ascent to the highest heaven.10 There also appears to be a clear shift of emphasis from a simple display of God's justice toward a direct focus on the experiences of the seer as a prototype of the postmortem trials of a pious soul as it advances toward the throne of the Almighty. The surviving portions of the Apocalypse of Zephaniah reflect a relatively early stage in the evolution of the type of apocalypse outlined above. Its closest parallels in both form and content are to be found in the apocalyptic portions of 1 Enoch, 2 Enoch, 3 Baruch, the Apocalypse of Paul, and the Nag Hammadi text CG V, 2,\" which also bears the title \"The Apocalypse of Paul.\" To a lesser extent there is also a formal parallel to be seen with the Testament of Levi and the Ascension of Isaiah. Specific parallels in content between the Apocalypse of Zephaniah and the apocalyptic writings listed above will be found in the notes that accompany the text. 9 J. T.

Rev 22:8 A a. In 2En 18 the seer also finds a host in the fifth heaven. In that text they are called \"Egoroi\" (\"Gre-gori\" in text A). Charles identifies them with the Aram. cirim who appear in Dan. That word is trans­lated into Gk. as egregoroi, \"watchers\" (Aquila, Symmachus). When Enoch first saw them, they were lamenting for their fallen brethren, but he persuaded them to praise God with their singing, as the \"lords\" are doing in the present passage. The background for designating an angelic host as \"lords\" may be sought in the LXX version of Deut 10:14-17 where the God of the heavens is described as \"God of gods and Lord of lords.\" The mention of \"many gods and many lords\" in ICor 8:5 may also be related to Deut 10:17, but it is basically pejorative in its thrust and conse­quently belongs to a different tradition than the present work. b. We have capitalized the Holy Spirit because the spirit is undoubtedly that of God. Nevertheless, there is no need to understand this in a trinitarian or Chris­tian sense as Clement may have done. There is suf­ficient attestation of the use in Jewish sources: Cf. WisSol 9:17;MartIs5:14;4Ezra 14:22; PssSol 17:42; CD 2.10. c. In Dan 7:9 there is mention of \"thrones\" being set up for a scene of judgment. The use of the plural suggests that members of the heavenly host are also to be enthroned beside the Ancient of Days. The same passage provides an OT background for the brilliant, luminous quality of the thrones portrayed in the present text. Cf. Col 1:16; Rev 4:4; Ascenls 7:13. d. The Gk. arretos, \"ineffable,\" may be used of God in two senses: (1) one who is indescribable because he is beyond comprehension, and (2) one whose name ought not to be spoken because it is prohibited outside of a limited cultic setting. It is difficult to know which sense is intended here because of the lack of context. Both uses were current in Jewish sources. e. The Gk. hupsistos, \"most high,\" was used in the LXX to render the Heb. 'elyon. It was subse­quently rather widely used in the apocrypha and pseudepigrapha as a divine name. Cf. Tob 1:4, 13; Jdt 13:13; 2Mac 3:31; 3Mac 6:2. See also TWOT. vol. 8, p. 618. B a. The meaning of the Cop. word used here and in vs. 5 is uncertain. b. \"Each one\" must refer to the angels. c. There is a similar phrase on fol. 35b of the Cop. version of the ApPaul edited by Budge. It reads, \"Be strong, O one who will triumph and you will triumph over the accuser, who will come up from Hades.\" The text of ApPaul must represent either a quotation from the present text or a borrowing from a common stock of liturgical expressions. The version in ApPaul has been corrupted so that it appears that the accuser is the one who will come up from Hades, but when it is corrected to agree with the wording of the present apocalypse the sense of ApPaul is im­proved.

The angel of the Lord appears in the OT as a figure closely identified with Yahweh. In the earlier portions of the OT he is sent to deliver a message from God or to assist Israel in time of distress. With the prophet Zechariah, however, the angel of the Lord becomes a guide and interlocutor who explained the visions that the prophet saw. It is in that role that the angel of the Lord appears in the present text. f. The Cop. word can also represent the Gk. words genos, \"genus,\" orphusis, \"nature.\" g. The same phrase is found at vs. 4:4. h. The remainder of the text is broken off. The reverse side of the papyrus is illegible, except for isolated words. 1 a. The author may be explaining what the burial practice in a typical situation is. That would contrast with the seer's own transformation. It is also possible that the seer is here quoting someone else who is describing the seer's own body, which appeared to be dead. In PJ there is an account of what happened when Jeremiah was undergoing a visionary experi­ence. Those who were left on the earth thought that he was dead and considered preparing his body for burial. The Cop. word that is used in the present passage means either \"to bury\" or \"to prepare the corpse for burial.\" In the Nag Hammadi ApPaul (CG V, 19, 27-29\"), Paul is apparently told to look back and see his own \"[likenessl\" upon the earth. Un­fortunately the text must be restored at that critical point. b. This description of the funeral rite is so brief that it is not possible to tell whether it is Christian or Jewish. The pattern clearly conforms to very early Christian practice, but that does not exclude the pos­sibility of it being Jewish. In 2Sam 3:31-4, King David provides a prototype for Jewish funeral proces­sions together with the accompanying lamentation. Josephus {Apion 2.27) describes the appropriate re­sponse of pious Jews of his time to a passing funeral procession. The recitation of Ps 91 during the proces­sion is apparently very ancient. 2 a. Jerusalem would be the most likely city to ap­pear in an apocalypse of Zephaniah. Note God's word in Zeph 1:10-13. It is also of interest to note Zech-ariah's considerable interest in Jerusalem since our author is greatly indebted to that prophet. b. Possibly \"no one.\" c. The present passage is obviously related to the words of Jesus reported in Mt 24:40f. and Lk 17:34f. (cf. GThom 91, 23). Unfortunately, the nature of the relationship is not easy to determine. If we agree with P. Lacau, \"remarques sur le manuscrit akhmimique des apocalypses de Sophonie et d'Elie,\" JA 254 (1966) 176, that the quotation \"two men ... on one road\" is simply a variant of the \"two men ... in the field,\" which appears at Mt 24:40, then we may compare the three versions in the following manner: (1) two men on one road (= field)—two women grinding at the mill—two in one bed (ApZeph), (2) two men in the field—two women grinding at the mill (Mt), (3) two in one bed—two women grinding— [two men in the field] (Lk). The ApZeph contains the fullest account. It mentions the \"mill\" of Mt and the \"bed\" of Lk. A simple solution might be to assume that the version of ApZeph is a conflation of the Gospel passages, but there are a number of reasons for re­jecting that position. Lacau has already noted that this would then be the only passage in the apocalypse that could be specifically identified as Christian. The structure of the saying suggests a carefully worked proverbial phrase, similar to the proverb about the drop on the bucket that follows. In the present saying, the action moves from two men on the road to two women who are presumably straining together in a common effort to turn the upper millstone, and then, finally, to a couple in bed. The scene becomes progressively more intimate as the saying continues. It begins with two men, turns to two women, and concludes with a couple (presumably a man and a woman). The fact that the proverb is so well con­structed and complete in its present form means that it is not a simple conflation. One is not obliged to accept the opinion that it is derived from the Gospel accounts. In fact, one could argue that Mt and Lk provide abbreviated variants of a longer parable. It is our opinion that this was a familiar parable that was used in the present work and alluded to by Mt, Lk, and the author of GThom. The proverbial nature of the saying is also apparent"},{"pageNumber":563,"pageContent":"women grinding together at a mill.

Although there is a slight lacuna at the end of the statement, it is hardly large enough to permit the author to explain his saying; he reasonably expected his readers to understand the saying as a familiar proverb dealing with the frailty of life and its inevi­table end. It is a vision that follows his discussion of a typical funeral procession; the reader was expected to supply a traditional understanding of the visitation of the Angel of Death, who would remove one of the partners in each of these vignettes (cf. GThom 91, 24). In order for the writer to assume that sort of reading, the proverb must have circulated in a form that made it readily applicable to the typical human experience. The Gospel quotations will not meet that requirement because they are set in the context of the sudden appearance of an eschatological age. The motif of a seer ascending and looking back to see events on earth is also found in ApPaul 13. The seer in that text watches men at the point of death as the soul leaves the body. Compare Nag Hammadi CG V, 19, 29-32. d. The pronoun must be restored in the text. e. The translation of \"[each] one of them acting for their (mutual) . . . upon a bed,\" is uncertain. If we were certain of the reading \"on a bed,\" or if we were able to restore the word that fits in the lacuna, we could then be more confident about reading the rest of the phrase. The word in the lacuna is a Gk. word ending in ia. We also know that it was feminine singular. Lacau suggested adikia, anomia, or some word suggesting repose. The list of words could be extended to include words meaning \"harmony,\" \"pleasure,\" or \"accord.\" The parallel from the GThom describes the two as \"resting\" or \"being at repose\" upon a bed. f. There are two scribal errors in this sentence. In the phrase \"which is suspended,\" the scribe wrote a chai instead of an e. g. In the phrase \"up from,\" he wrote an e instead of a chai. The translation of 2:3-5 depends upon reconstructions of the text suggested by Lacau in JA 254 (1966) 169-95. h. The question appears to be a non sequitur in the present context, where it follows proverbial ob­servations on the tenuous nature of human existence. It is possible that there was a lacuna in the MS from which the present text was copied, or perhaps the abrupt change is simply a witness to a rather crude conflation of sources. In its present setting, the question concerning the absence of darkness is introduced by the comment that \"There was nothing before my eyes,\" and ex­amples of the seer's unusual vision as he observes people engaged in various activities from his location high above the city. i. The term pantokrator was well established in Jewish writings on the basis of its use for translating fba'ot and Saddai in the LXX. Although the term gains currency among the patristic writers, its use in the NT is strictly limited. Apart from an OT quotation in 2Cor 6:18, it is found only in Rev. For its use within the OT see \"Theological Importance.\" j. There is a scribal error at this point. He wrote o instead of e at the beginning of the word for \"if.\" k. A slight emendation is required to permit the reading \"you (certainly) have compassion.\" 3 a. A feminine noun that describes a location is needed at this point. There is a similar phrase in the Cop. (Budge) ApPaul, a work that appears to depend on the present text in several places. The Cop. text published by Budge (Miscellaneous Coptic Texts in the Dialect of Upper Egypt, p. 568) records the following command by Paul's guiding angel: \"Rise up now and follow me and let me show you your place.\" The angel then leads Paul into Paradise. b. Probably Edomite Seir, which is closely asso­ciated with Mount Sinai in the theophanies that appear in the Song of Deborah (Judg 5:4f. and Deut 33:2). Throughout the OT, Edom is treated as a model pf villainy, but after the conquest of Edom by John Hyrcanus, the Idumeans begin to be fully involved in the affairs of Judah. During the period of Antipater and the Herodians, pro-Edomite sentiment undoubt­edly flourished. Despite the fact that hatred for those Idumean monarchs only intensified the traditional mistrust of Edom among certain Jewish parties, there were others who sought their favor. For example, Josephus reports in his War (4.4) that the Idumeans came to Jerusalem to assist the Zealots shortly before that city fell to the Romans. The most likely period for this pro-Edomite portion of the narrative that locates the prophet's vision on Mount Seir is between 128 B.C. and A.D. 70, when there was a reasonable motive for recalling positive references to Mount Seir in the OT or for making it the locus of a new vision. In the Nag Hammadi ApPaul, the ascent of the apostle takes place from the mountain of Jericho.

I will not permit them to come to you because the 10 Lord Almighty sent me to you because (you) are pure before him.\" »Then he beckoned to them, and they withdrew themselves and they ran from me. c. This passage might possibly be decisive for dating the apocalypse if we could identify Joatham and his sons. Unfortunately, that is not a simple matter. The name Joatham appears in Josephus as a spelling for Jotham (cf. spelling of Jotham in Mt 1:9). Josephus identifies two high priests by that name. In a list that parallels IChr 6:4-8, 50-53, and Ezra 7:2-5, Josephus (Ant 8.12) has inserted Joatham at the point where the biblical writers list Uzzi and Zerahiah as ancestors of Solomon's priest, Zadok. A second Jotham, son of Juelus, is mentioned in a list of high priests who held office between the time of Solomon and the Babylonian captivity. Jotham is the tenth priest in line. Using an average of twenty years for the length of a high priest's tenure, Jotham, son of Juelus, would have served sometime during the period of Ahaz or Hezekiah. It is conceivable that his sons might have disgraced themselves during the reign of Manasseh and Amon. The biblical Zepha­niah, who provided the pseudonym for the present work, and who began his labors shortly after the reign of Amon, delivered an important oracle (Zeph 1:1-6) against the priests in Jerusalem, who are charged with swearing by both Yahweh and Milcom (vss. 4f.). In the Heb. text, the errant priests are called kemarim, a term not used for legitimate priests of Yahweh, but the Heb. text also adds the phrase \"with the priests.\" Zephaniah threatened to remove the names of those priests. At best any argument for identifying the Jotham of this text with either of the priests mentioned by Josephus remains a fragile hypothesis. It is equally possible that the author has in mind some lesser priest whose family affairs were notorious among the con­temporaries of the author of ApZeph. d. There may be a temporal sequence here, with two angels rejoicing before the three sons sin (3:2-4) and two others weeping afterward. It is also possible that the text simply describes two different angelic responses. Two bad angels rejoice in wickedness and two good angels weep. e. Compare ApPaul, chs. 7, 9, and 10. In that text angels bring forth deeds of men, whether good or evil, at sunset. One angel goes forth rejoicing and another goes out with a sad face. f. \"Their manuscript\" is corrected from scribal \"his manuscript.\" The plural pronoun refers to the angels. The plural is correctly used in 3:8, and the singular is correctly used in 3:9, where the pronoun refers to the accuser. g. Compare Ps 69:28, where the Book of the Liv­ing is parallel to those \"enrolled among the right­eous.\" Compare also Ex 32:32f.; Ps 40:7: Isa 34:16; Dan 7:10; 12:1; Mai 3:16; Phil 4:3; Rev 3:5; 13:8. h. It may also be read \"who is over the earth,\" in the sense of authority, or it could refer to the angels who are upon or over the earth. i. The Cop. construction is adverbial, describing the direction of the verb of motion. Perhaps the region of the accuser is \"down there.\" 4 a.

At 9:30 Isaiah is apparently transformed to appear like an angel. In 10:18-27 Isaiah witnesses the various transformations of the Lord as he descends from heaven to heaven. The reader is reminded of the transfiguration scenes in Mk 9:21*.; Mt 17:2: Lk 9:28f.; or the theological commentary of 2Cor 3:18. The ancestor of the transfiguration motif in Judaism may ultimately be the translation of Elijah in 2Kgs 2:11 or the account of Moses' shining face in Ex 34:29. The expectation that all who are righteous will be transfigured is based on Dan 12. The theme is enthusiastically expanded in apocalyptic literature. Compare 4Ezra 7:97, 125; 2Bar 51:3, 10; IEn 39:7; 104:2. The writers also conceived of a continuum between the angels and men who would become like the angels. Cf. IEn 104:6 and 2Bar 51:10. Conse­quently, angels might also be subject to transforma­tions. Angelic messengers faced the same problem that confronted Moses when he was forced to veil and unveil his face as he moved between God and men in Ex 34:33-35. Apparently the angels dealt with the problem through a series of transformations. b. This translation assumes that the sights within the city were not meant to be revealed. Compare ApPaul 21, where Paul is prohibited from revealing what he has seen in the third heaven. ApPaul is obviously dependent on Paul's note in 2Cor 12:1-4. Nevertheless, the idea of secret lore, sealed books, hidden knowledge is the stock-in-trade of Jewish apocrypha (= hidden matters) generally. Compare 4Ezra 14:4-6. 44-46: Dan 12:4. If the seer's mouth was closed with respect to mysteries seen within the city, that would explain why very little is described beyond the gates and the overall beauty of the square. The reader has been led to expect a report of the seer's vision and an angelic explanation of each scene, but that is missing from the episode within the city. c. In most of the apocalyptic writings gates are described as part of the heavenly city, but in TAb 11 (rec. A), there are two gates within the first gate of heaven. One leads on a narrow way for the blessed and one leads to a wide path for those who are evil. An earlier ancestor of that scene is to be found in the Myth of Er in Plato's Republic 614-21. Plato does not describe the entrances to heaven and Hades as gates, but TAb provides evidence that such a feature was known in apocalyptic writings. The gates which our seer beheld with fire being cast forth could pos­sibly be the gates opening up from Hades. 6 a. Steindorff suggests that this represents a Heb. phrase, \"lohay. iaddnay. h'ddnay sfbcfot. which would be translated \"My God, my Lord, Lord of Hosts.\" That looks like a curious expression indeed. It is hard to imagine that it would be constructed in a Heb.-speaking community. It is also strange that anyone would translate the first iadonay and transcribe the second. It would appear that the author of this text was not well acquainted with Heb. He apparently knew two Heb. Epithets: \"Eloe\" and \"Adonai Sa­baoth.\" He used the two of them together with his own Gk. term kurios to address God by means of three of his titles: \"Eloe, Kurios, Adonai Sabaoth.\" The Cop. translator translated the Gk. and left the Heb. transcriptions in place. b. This vs. also contains the phrase \"his hair was spread out like women's.\" One of these descriptions appears to be redundant. Steindorff suggested that there might have been a description of his face which was like \"the lionesses'.\" At this point he compared a text from Cod. Bruc. 227, 1. 6, in which the description of the face of the figure precedes the description of its teeth.

In that text Ezra asks how long he must wait until the new age, and he is informed that the righteous are in the underworld and in the cham­bers of the souls, which are like a womb that will bear when its time is filled. In 2Bar 55:3 and 63:6 the name is spelled Ramiel. He is described in that text as \"the angel. . . who presides over true visions'' (55:3). In IEn 20, the spelling is Remiel. He is listed as one of the seven archangels; he is set over \"those who rise.\" d. The Cop. phrase is ambiguous.

This sentence is an attempt to sum up the pre­ceding episode. It is addressed to the hearers, who are identified as \"my sons.\" The homiletical aside suggests that this portion of the text was prepared for use within an organized religious community that assembled to hear lectures or sermons. It is not pos­sible to determine whether the text was originally written for that purpose or simply used in that manner by later generations. b. The mention of weighing good and evil in a balance reminds one of the Egyptian prototype for judgment in the underworld. 9 a. \"Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Enoch, Elijah, and David.'' These six righteous ones have a special status for the writer of ApZeph. After leaving Hades, where Eremiel watches over the souls entrusted to him, the seer enters the realm of the righteous and meets those who did not sojourn in Hades. In this group, Enoch serves as the prototype for others. The statement that \"Enoch walked with God. Then he vanished because God took him\" (Gen 5:24) gave rise to early spec­ulation about where he was taken. Jub 4:23 reports that he was conducted to the garden of Eden, where he writes down all the wickedness of the children of men. In IEn 70 we are told that his name was raised aloft and he saw angels measuring the place for the elect and righteous. He also saw the first fathers and the righteous who dwelt there. Unfortunately, that ch. in IEn cannot be dated. According to J. T. Milik, The Books of Enoch, p. 4, it is from a portion of IEn which was not attested at Qumran. The removal of the patriarchs and David to Paradise presented a more severe problem because their death and burial was an accepted fact, and their tombs were available as shrines. TAb, TIsaac, and TJac, which are relatively late documents, preserve an account of how it was done. The body of each patriarch was buried, but his soul was removed to be with God (cf. ApMos for the removal of Adam's soul). An earlier witness to that tradition may possibly be seen in Jesus' argument preserved in Mt 22:29-33. The climax of the argument is found in vs. 32, \"I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob? God is God, not of the dead, but of the living.\" Apparently a similar removal was accorded King David, whose eternal presence was required as a musician who leads the praise of God with his harp and song (cf. ApPaul 29). See also the Cop. (Budge) ApPaul, fol. 36a. The motivation for David's transfer to a heavenly scene is probably to be located in a text such as the LXX version of Ps 16(LXX 15):10, in which it is stated that God would not leave his (i.e. David's) soul in Hades. It is also quite possible that the author of Acts 2:25-36 was arguing against a popular Jewish opinion that the soul of David was in Paradise while his uncorruptible body remained in the tomb. The author of Acts would be opposed to the theology of the present text because he explicitly states that \"David did not ascend into the heavens.\" It is interesting to note that the Christian addition to 4Ezra, commonly referred to as 5Ezra, contains a list of Jewish heroes that begins with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Elijah, and Enoch. It then adds the names of the prophets, but it does not mention David. The number of righteous persons in the heavenly Paradise described in our text is not obvious.

The accompanying chart shows the confused and confusing nomenclature of the diverse titles applied to the work. The opening two chapters set forth a divine call to Ezra, a man of priestly descent (1:1-3), to reprove the Jewish people for their waywardness despite God's repeated mercies (1:4—2:32). Rejected by Israel, Ezra turns to the gentiles (2:33-41) and is granted a vision of a great multitude that stands on Mount Zion, each receiving a crown from \"the Son of God, whom they confessed in the world\" (2:42-48). Following this Christian introduction, the main body of the book (chs. 3-14), written by a Jewish author and preserved in several Oriental versions (see \"Texts\"), sets forth seven visions granted to Salathiel, also called Ezra, in Babylon. In the first vision (3:1-5:19), presented in dialogue form, Ezra bewails the fate of his people and raises perplexing questions concerning the origins of the world's sin and suffering. He is assured that the end of the age is near. In the second vision (5:21-6:34), after reiterating his complaint that God has abandoned his own chosen people to the gentiles, Ezra raises a new problem concerning the lot of those who die before the present age has passed away (5:41) and is assured that their lot will be similar to that of those living at the inauguration of the new age (5:42-6:10). There follows a list of the signs of the end of the age (6:11-28). The lengthy third vision (6:35-9:25) describes the final judgment and the future state of the righteous and the wicked (7:26—[131]). Expressing great compassion for the lost, Ezra struggles with the problem of reconciling God's mercy with the destruction of the wicked (7:[ 132-40]) and once again makes intercession to God on their behalf (8:4-36). This is followed by an admonition that Ezra, who is destined for eternal bliss, would do better to think about his own future than to brood over the lot of sinners, which they deserve (8:37-62). The vision concludes with a recapitulation of the signs that will precede the end (8:63-9:25). The fourth vision (9:26-10:59) depicts a woman in deep mourning for her only son and describes her suffering (9:38-10:4). She is suddenly transformed into a glorious city, identified as heavenly Zion in the day of salvation (10:25-59). The fifth vision (11:1-12:39) is an elaborate allegory illustrating the course of future history by means of an eagle rising from the sea (11:1-35). The eagle, Ezra is told, represents the Roman Empire, which will be punished by God's Messiah for persecuting his elect (12:10-34). In the sixth vision (13:1-58) Ezra sees one like a man rising from the sea, who, with the 1 Modern scholars sometimes designate chs. 1-2 as 5 Ezra and chs. 15-16 as 6 Ezra."},{"pageNumber":571,"pageContent":"clouds of heaven at the head of a great army, annihilates his enemies with a stream of fire issuing from his mouth. The seventh and final vision (14:1-48) is an account of how an angel commissions Ezra to dictate for forty days to five men, who produce in this manner ninety-four books, namely twenty-four canonical books and seventy esoteric books that will remain hidden. At this point the Oriental versions of the book come to an end (see \"Texts\"). The Christian form of the book, preserved in Latin manuscripts, continues with a kind of appendix comprising chapters 15 and 16. These contain denunciations against the enemies of God's people and exhortations for the chosen people to put their trust in God. Texts The following translation is made from the Latin text edited by R. L. Bensly, The Fourth Book of Ezra. In general the translation follows the rendering of the Revised Standard Version of the book (the initial draft of which was prepared by the present writer), but is modified by minor alterations and corrections. The Latin manuscripts cited by Bensly are the following: 1. Codex Sangermanensis, A.D. 822, formerly in the Library of the Benedictine Abbey of S. Germain des Pres at Paris, now in the Bibliotheque Nationale, number 11505 Fonds Latin. This, the oldest known copy of 4 Ezra, lacks 7:[36]—[105] and is the parent of the vast majority of extant manuscripts.2 The missing section had at one time been contained on a leaf that had been cut out in early times. Since the passage contains an emphatic denial of the value of prayers for the dead (7:[ 105]), it is probable that the excision was made deliberately for dogmatic reasons. 2. Codex Ambianensis, a Carolingian minuscule of the ninth century is number 10 in the Bibliotheque Communale of Amiens. This manuscript contains the \"missing\" section (7:136H105]).3 3. Codex Complutensis, written in a Visigothic hand and dating from the ninth to tenth centuries, formerly of Complutum (Alcala de Henares), is now MS 31 in the Library of the Central University at Madrid. 4. Codex Mazarinaeus is in two volumes, dating from the eleventh century, numbered 3 and 4 (formerly 6, 7) in the Bibliotheque Mazarine at Paris. The text of 4 Ezra is given in the sequence of chapters 3-16, 1 and 2. The types of text of 4 Ezra in these and other Latin manuscripts fall into two main families: the French group (represented by MSS S and A) and the Spanish group (represented by MSS C and M). In general the French family presents a superior text. Other versions of 4 Ezra (chs. 3—14) are the Syriac, Ethiopic, Armenian, and two independent Arabic versions; the last three are rather free renderings, of little value in reconstructing the original text. In addition, fragments of a Coptic and of a Georgian version are extant. The following are the chief editions of these seven Oriental versions.4 Syriac: The Old Testament in Syriac According to the Peshitta Version, edited on behalf of the International Organization for the Study of the Old Testament by the Peshitta Institute of the University of Leiden (eds.

The original is Bodleian MS Or 251 (cat. Nicoll, p. 13, no. VI) of A.D. 1354,6 and the copy is in the Vatican (Arab. 3). The Arabic text was published by E. G. A. Ewalt in \"Das vierte Ezrabuch nach seinem Zeitalter, seinen arabischen Ubersetzungen und einer neuen Wiederherstellung,\" in Abhandlungen der Koniglichen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaf-ten zu Gottingen, vol. XI (1863). A second Arabic version, known as Arab 2, exists in a complete form in a Vatican manuscript (Arab. 462) of the fourteenth century and in partial form in two other manuscripts. The Vatican manuscript was edited with a Latin translation by J. Gildemeister, Esdrae liber quartus arabice e codice Vaticano (Bonn, 1877). Two further fragments of an Arabic version independent of Arab 1 and Arab 2 are also known.7 Coptic (Sahidic): A fragmentary parchment leaf, dating from the sixth to the eighth centuries, was edited by J. Leipoldt and B. Violet, \"Ein saidisches Bruchstuck des vierten Esrabuches,\" Zeitschrift fiir agyptische Sprache und Altertumskunde 41 (1904) 138-40. The leaf contains 4 Ezra 3:29-46. Georgian: Portions of 4 Ezra are contained in two manuscripts: one preserved in the Library of the Greek Patriarchate at Jerusalem (MS 7+11 written A.D. 1050), and the other—containing excerpts comprising about two thirds of the book—in the lavra of Iveron on Mount Athos (written A.D. 978). The two manuscripts, according to Blake, \"go back to the same archetype, and that by no means a remote one\" (HTR 19 [1926] 303). See R. P. Blake, \"The Georgian Version of Fourth Esdras from the Jerusalem Manuscript,\" HTR 19 (1926) 299-375, and \"The Georgian Text of Fourth Esdras from the Athos MS,\" HTR 22 (1929) 57-105. Blake is of the opinion that the Georgian and the Ethiopic versions go back to a single Greek archetype (HTR 19 [1926] 309). In a more recent study Kourtsikidze finds that the Georgian texts edited by Blake are represented also by a fragment of the Paris Lectionary (ed. M. Tarchnichvili).8 Greek: A tiny scrap of papyrus found at Oxyrhynchus, dating from about the fourth century (POxy 1010), preserves the text of 15:57-59. There is also a condensation in Greek of chapters 11 and 12 contained in a manuscript dated A.D. 1656, which is in the Library of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate at Jerusalem (no. 160). When the text is compared with that of the several versions of 4 Ezra, it appears that the condensation was made from the current Latin form of the book.9 Original language The relation of the extant versions of the Ezra Apocalypse (chs. 3-14) to each other and to a lost original has received prolonged and repeated study. Not a few instances have been collected in which differences between the several versions (with the possible exception of 5 Textural problems in the Arm. version of 4Ezra are dealt with by Stone in Museon 79 (1966) 387-400; HTR 60 (1967) 107-15; and Textus 6 (1968) 48-61; see also Stone's Concordance and Texts of the Armenian Version of IV Ezra (Oriental Notes and Studies 11; Jerusalem, 1971). 6 In 1646, John Gregory of Christ Church, Oxford, called attention to this MS as preserving \"the most authenticke remaine\" of 4Ezra. At the beginning of the 18th cent., at the request of William Whiston, Simon Ockley, the noted Arabist at Oxford, prepared an ET of this version for inclusion in the former's curious work entitled Primitive Christianity Reviv'd (London, 1711) vol. 4. On the continent J. A. Fabricius made a Lat. translation of Ockley's rendering for his Codicis pseudepigraphi Veteris Testamenti (Hamburg, 1723) vol. 2, pp. 173-307, and J. H. Haug made a German translation (probably from Fabricius) of the \"missing\" section of ch. 7 for the Berleburg Bibel (1742) vol. 8, pp. 105f. 7 For details, see Violet, Die Ezra-Apokalypse, p. xxxix, and G.

According to B. Outtier (Bedi Kartlisa 33 [1975] 382), this study represents, with some changes and corrections, Kourtsikidze's work that appeared in Mravaltavi 1 (1971) 93-109. 9 So R.

For example, in 8:6 the Latin locum obviously arose from misreading Greek typon as topon, and in 9:19 the Latin and Oriental versions took nomos (accented on the first syllable) as \"law,\" which does not fit the context, instead of nomos (accented on the last syllable) as \"pasture.\" Likewise the internal evidence of versions often suggests dependence upon an underlying Greek text. For example, the Latin sometimes reproduces Greek constructions (e.g. the genitive absolute) or Greek genders that are unknown to Latin grammar. Furthermore, quotations of 4 Ezra included in Greek patristic and apocryphal documents presuppose knowledge of a Greek version of the book.10 In modern times Hilgenfeld, with the assistance of Lagarde and H. Ronsch, reconstructed the lost Greek text from the Latin version.11 There remain, however, many other phenomena that suggest a Semitic original lying behind the lost Greek text. Several scholars have argued that this was Aramaic.12 On the other hand, the presence of instances of notable Hebraisms (such as the infinitive absolute construction) has led most modern scholars to postulate a Hebrew original underlying the Greek.13 Date According to most scholars,14 the original Jewish document known today as 4 Ezra was composed about A.D. 100. This opinion rests upon a more or less plausible interpretation of the opening sentence, which states that \"in the thirtieth year after the destruction of our city\" Salathiel, who is also called Ezra, was in Babylon and underwent the experiences recounted in the visions that follow (3:1). Although this purports to be in the thirtieth year after the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar in 586 B.C., it becomes obvious when one begins to study the book that this statement is intended to refer cryptically to the fall of Jerusalem in A.D. 70 (3:2; 6:19; 10:48; and elsewhere). Since it is difficult to believe that a Jewish book of this kind could have found its way into Christian circles after the Bar-Kokhba revolt, when Church and Synogogue had become hopelessly alienated, the date of the completion of the Hebrew original cannot be placed much after A.D. 120. This would allow time for the Greek version to have been made and taken up in Christian circles. Near the middle or in the second half of the third century four chapters were added, two at the beginning and two at the end, by one or more unknown Christian writers. Provenance Although several scholars have thought that the core of 4 Ezra was composed in Rome among the Jewish Diaspora (the reference to Babylon [3:1] being understood as a cryptic reference to Rome), the obviously Semitic coloration of the work rather suggests Palestine as the place of writing and publication of the Hebrew original. There is no trace of any influence from Egyptian Judaism or from the Qumran community. Theological importance Among the more prominent theological ideas presented in 4 Ezra is the author's belief in God as the one and only Creator (3:4; 6:38-55; 6:1-6).

Besides being Judge at the final judgment (6:1-6), God is merciful and compassionate (7:[ 132—38]). The Law is a divine gift to Israel (3:19f.; 9:3If.). It had indeed been offered to the other nations of the world but was deliberately rejected by them (7:23f., [72]); Israel, on the other hand, had accepted it. It was for this reason, the writer holds, that Israel was elected by God to be his special possession and chosen people. It is here that the particular pathos of the book emerges as the author wrestles with the question: Why has God delivered his people into the hands of their enemies? What puzzles the author is that God should permit Israel's oppressors to be in prosperity, while his own people, who are at least no worse than these, he leaves to perish (3:30, 32). It is with this question bearing on divine justice that the seer agonizes, seeking \"to justify the ways of God to man.\" In the end, however, the author concludes that God's ways are inscrutable. The teaching of 4 Ezra on the subject of mankind and human free will is basically pessimistic. Sin is conceived as consisting essentially in unfaithfulness to the Law (9:36), resulting in alienation and estrangement from God (7:[48]). Although free will is definitely asserted in a few passages (e.g. 3:8; 8:56-58), the seer believed that inevitably all have turned away from God. This defection is due, in some way, to the sin of Adam (7:[118]), who possessed an evil heart (cor malignum, 3:20) in which a grain of evil seed (granum seminis mali) had been sown (4:30). Since all of Adam's descendants have followed his example in clothing themselves with an evil heart (3:26), each is morally responsible.15 It will be seen that this view corresponds to the rabbinic doctrine of the evil inclination or impulse (yeser ha-rcf). The eschatological speculations of the book are extensive and somewhat involved. The author's consideration of the traditional belief in a messianic kingdom set up on earth, a kingdom which in his view will endure for four hundred years (7:28f.), is overshadowed by concern to penetrate the mystery of the world to come and the conditions of the afterlife. The dawn of the end of the age will be heralded by wonderful and terrible signs—physical, moral, and political (4:52-5:13a; 6:11-29; 7:26-[44]; 8:63-9:12). After the resurrection (5:45; 7:32, [37]) and the judgment (7:33-35; 7:[105, 115]) the wicked will go to the furnace of Hell and the righteous to the Paradise of delight (7:36, [78-101]). In addition to these otherworldly speculations, 4 Ezra also contains, in other sections of the book, quite different eschatological teachings. In the Eagle Vision (ch. 12) a purely political eschatology is concerned with release from the tyranny of Rome, secured by the Messiah, who will then set up the Kingdom of God upon earth (12:32-34; cf. 11:44-46). Different again is the eschatology of the Vision of the Man rising from the Sea (ch. 13); in this vision the pre-existent Messiah, after annihilating all his enemies, gathers a peaceful multitude (the ten \"lost\" tribes of Israel) to himself. In this connection a comment may be added as to the role of the Messiah in the total eschatological thought of 4 Ezra. This role, as Stone points out,16 is difficult to assess. Besides taking up the whole attention of chapter 13 and playing a significant role in chapters 11-12, the Messiah is mentioned elsewhere in the book only at 7:28f. Stone conjectures that the reason for the relative paucity of references to the Messiah may be that he was not the answer to the questions that Ezra was asking. At the same time, though the Messiah is not the exclusive center of the seer's aspirations, he plays a significant role in the author's eschatological scheme. One other feature of the seer's theological outlook deserves comment. This is his uni-versalism, shown in his world-embracing solicitude not only for his own nation, but for all people whose wickedness will bring them to a tragic fate in the next life. His pathetic lament concerns humanity as a whole, regardless of racial origins (7:[62-69]). In fact, the compassion of Ezra for the lost seems at times to exceed that attributed by the author to God himself (cf. 8:37-62), for when he makes intercession at length in behalf of the mass of mankind who, as sinners, will be doomed, his prayer is in vain. He is told bluntly, \"Many have been created, but few will be saved\" (8:3). 15 For the most recent discussion of this doctrine see A. L. Thompson, Responsibility for Evil in the Theodicy of IV Ezra. 16 M. E. Stone, \"The Concept of the Messiah in IV Ezra,\" Goodenough Festschrift, pp. 295-312."},{"pageNumber":575,"pageContent":"Unity of the book From what has been said in the preceding section concerning the eschatological features of 4 Ezra 3-14, it can be seen that quite disparate elements are represented. There has been, therefore, not a little debate as to whether the book is the product of a redactor who combined the diverse productions of several authors,17 or whether, despite more or less minor incon­sistencies arising from the utilization of varying traditions, the artistry of the book suggests the hand of a single author who managed to fit heterogeneous details into a more or less coherent scheme.18 Although such a question cannot, perhaps, be regarded as permanently settled, many scholars today tend to regard chapters 3-14 as representing the author's own conception and handiwork. Relation to canonical books A number of resemblances in thought and diction with the New Testament occur in the Ezra Apocalypse (chs. 3-14), but none of them suggests direct dependence. In 7:7 the writer speaks of the narrow entrance that leads to the abode of the righteous, a concept that occurs also in Matthew 7:13f. With the statement \"Many have been created, but few will be saved\" (8:3) compare Matthew 22:14 and Luke 13:23f. In 4:33 the seer asks, in reference to the time when the new age will come, \"How long and when will these things be?\"—with which may be compared the words of the disciples to Jesus in Luke 21:7. Parallels with Pauline theology occur in the seer's treatment of the evil yeser (see \"Theological importance\") as compared with Romans 5:12-22, and the personification of Zion as \"the mother of us all\" (10:7) as compared with Galatians 4:26, \"the Jerusalem that is above ... is our mother.'' The transiency of human life as described in 7:[61], \"the multitude ... are now like a mist, and are similar to a flame and smoke,\" may be compared with James 4:14: \"What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes.\" In 4 Ezra 12:42 the comparison of Ezra as being \"like a lamp in a dark place\" reminds one of the exhortation to pay attention to the prophetic word \"as to a lamp shining in a dark place\" (2Pet 2:19). The Messiah's destruction of a hostile multitude by the breath of his mouth (13: lOf.) finds a parallel in 2 Thessalonians 2:8. The reader will find a considerable number of parallels between 4 Ezra and the Book of Revelation.19 Among these are the noteworthy similarities between the account in 13:32-39 and the context of Revelation 7:9 and 14:1. The former refers to the messianic woes followed by the coming of the Son of Man, who will stand on Mount Zion and gather to himself \"a multitude that was peaceable.\" Relation to apocryphal books Many scholars have pointed to a very considerable number of parallel passages between 4 Ezra and 2 Baruch, which is also sometimes called the (Syriac) Apocalypse of Baruch.20 The latter work, which on the whole represents a point of view and a theological outlook somewhat more in accordance with later rabbinical Judaism than 4 Ezra, appears to have been written as an answer to the perplexities mentioned by the seer. Several striking parallels can be found between 4 Ezra and 1 Enoch, particularly the latest section of 1 Enoch (i.e. chs. 37-71, the Similitudes of Enoch). These include 4 Ezra 6:49-52 and 1 Enoch 60:7-9; 4 Ezra 7:32f. and 1 Enoch 51:1, 3; 4 Ezra 7:137] and 1 Enoch 62:1. 17 See e.g. R. Kabisch, Das vierte Buch Esra (Gottingen, 1889), who identified two basic documents and three minor ones that were combined by a redactor; Box, The Ezra-Apocalypse, pp. xxii-xxxiii; W. O. E.

A few extracts from it are still used in the Christian liturgy; e.g. the Introit of the Mass for the Dead in the Roman Missal (Requiem aeternam . . .) is based on 2:34f. The dying words of Bishop Latimer spoken to his brother martyr when, in 1555, both were about to be burned at the stake in front of Balliol College, Oxford (\"Be of good comfort, Master Ridley. Play the man. We shall this day light such a candle, by God's grace, in England, as I trust shall never be put out.\") echo the traditional rendering of 14:25. Of greater significance is the remarkable influence of 4 Ezra on Christopher Columbus, William Whiston, and John Ruskin.22 A passage from \"the prophet Ezra\" encouraged Columbus to venture to set sail. In 6:42 a comment is made about God's work of creation: \"On the third day you commanded the waters to be gathered together in the seventh part of the earth; six parts you dried up and kept so that some of them might be planted and cultivated and be of service before you.\" Although, of course, the proportion of water to dry land is nearly the reverse of Ezra's figures, Columbus was heartened by Ezra's erroneous comment on Genesis. In fact, it was partly by quoting this verse to the hesitant sovereigns of Spain that Columbus finally obtained financial support for his several voyages. In the first half of the eighteenth century the learned and eccentric William Whiston, Sir Isaac Newton's successor as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in Cambridge University, drew up a list of ninety-nine \"proofs\" that the end of the age was at hand. One third of these signs come from 4 Ezra (5:1-13; 6:20-24; 9:1-8) and are quite general, resembling similar predictions in the canonical Scriptures. For example, the forty-sixth and the sixty-fifth \"Signals\" in his total list are that \"Wickedness should be vastly encreas'd beyond Measure of former Ages\" and that \"Incontinency, Vileness, and Wickedness, shall be increased upon the Earth.\" Much more specific was Whiston's interpretation of the significance of the rumor, circulating in 1726, that an illiterate farm woman of Surrey, named Mary Toft, had given birth to a litter of rabbits. To the torrent of pamphlets and editorials written for and against the truth of the story, Whiston added his impassioned defense—for he was convinced that here was a signal fulfillment of Ezra's prophecy that at the end of the age \"women shall bring forth monsters\" (5:8). Among the books of the Apocrypha to which Milton gave repeated attention was 4 Ezra, which he referred to as 2 Esdras. On the occasion of writing the introduction to his Deucalion, he says: It chanced, this morning, as I sat down to finish my preface that I had, for my introductory reading, the fifth chapter of the second book of Esdras; in which, though often read carefully before, I had never enough noticed the curious verse, \"Blood shall drop out of wood, and the stone shall give his voice, and the people shall be troubled\" [5:5]. Of which verse, so far as I can gather the meaning from the context, and from the rest of the chapter, the intent is, that in the time spoken of by the prophet, which, if not our own, is one exactly corresponding to it, the deadness of men to all noble things shall be so great, that the sap of trees shall be more truly blood, in God's sight, than their hearts' blood; and the silence of men, in praise of all noble things, so great, that the stones shall cry out, in God's hearing, instead of their tongues . . . 21 For a list of nearer and more remote parallels, see H.

For the world lies in 21 darkness, and its inhabitants are without light. »For your Law has been burned, and so no one knows the things which have been done or will be done by you. 22 If then I have found favor before you, send the Holy Spirit to me, and I will write everything that has happened in the world from the beginning, the things which were written in your Law, that men may be able to find the path, and that those who wish to live in the last days may live.\" 23 He answered me and said, \"Go and gather the people, and tell them not to seek 24 you for forty days. 'But prepare for yourself many writing tablets, and take with Ex 24:i8; 34:28 you Sarea, Dabria, Selemia, Ethanus, and Asiel—these five, because they are 25 trained to write rapidly; *and you shall come here, and I will light in your heart the lamp of understanding, which shall not be put out until what you are about to 26 write is finished. #And when you have finished, some things you shall make public, and some you shall deliver in secret to the wise; tomorrow at this hour you shall begin to write.\" Ezra's address to the people 27 Then I went as he commanded me, and I gathered all the people together, and 28,29 said, #\"Hear these words, O Israel. #At first our fathers dwelt as aliens in Egypt, 30 and they were delivered from there, #and received the Law of life, which they did 31 not keep, which you also have transgressed after them.

A NEW TRANSLATION AND INTRODUCTION BY M, E. STONE The Greek Apocalypse of Ezra contains the visions received by Ezra, who had fasted and prayed to have the mysteries of God revealed to him. His prayer is answered; and he is taken up into heaven, where he intercedes for the sinners whom he sees being punished. God replies that he rewards the righteous for their righteousness (1). Ezra once again prays, expressing deep questions about the righteousness of the world and the punishment of sinners. Angels appear to him and he again prays for the sinners. Adam's sin, he is told, was due to Satan, but Ezra observes that \"If you had not given him Eve, the serpent would never have deceived her\" (2:16). Ezra again remonstrates with God, requesting mercy for mankind (2:18-25). He asks for a vision of the day of judgment; it is granted (2:26-3:7). The signs of the approaching end, particularly internecine strife, are set before him. In chapter 4, Ezra is led down into Tartarus. He sees Herod being punished; then he descends to the bottom of hell. There he sees various sorts of sinners being punished as befits their crimes. Next, he sees the Antichrist; his appearance and his signs are described. Subsequently, he sees further cases of punishments and is taken to heaven (5:1-7). The wonders of the development of the fetus are set forth before him, emphasizing Ezra's doubts about the creation of man (5:12-14). He then sees the saints in heaven, certain cosmological secrets, and some details of the judgment. The final part of the writing contains an account of Ezra's struggle with the angel for his own soul, a description of God's comfort to him as death approaches, his concluding prayer, and the narrative of his death and burial. The whole concludes with a doxology (chs. 6 and 7). Text The writing was first published in 1866 by C. Tischendorf from a fifteenth-century Greek manuscript preserved in Paris (Cod. Par. Graec. 929), although scholars earlier had noted its existence.1 It has been translated into English and German.2 There doubtless exist a number of other manuscripts, and at least one further has already been noted.3 The text of the manuscript upon which Tischendorf based his edition also serves as the base of the present translation. The manuscript, unfortunately, is both faulty and corrupt at a number of points. Tischendorf suggested numerous emendations, most of which have been accepted herein. In a number of cases additional emendations have been suggested. Sometimes his suggestions have been rejected, changed, or modified (the more significant of these are placed in the notes to the translation).4 The Greek language of the writing is late in character. It is notable for a number of anomalous forms and usages: among them, kolasasthai, \"condemn,\" in 1:11; anapausdmai, \"I shall give rest,\" and kathesteka, \"I am,\" in 1:12; 1 C. von Tischendorf, Apocalypses Apocryphae, pp. 24-33. On earlier scholars, see his Introduction, pp. xii-xiv. 2 A. Walker, \"The Revelation of Esdras,\" ANF, vol. 8, pp. 571-74. P. Riessler, pp. 126-37 and brief nn. on p. 1273. 3 Cod. Par. Graec. 390, 16th cent., noted by A.-M. Denis, Introduction, p. 92. Denis's chapter on this work is the only attempt at a study of the apocalypse and contains much valuable information; see his Introduction, pp. 91-96. 4 These will be published by M. E. Stone in \"The Metamorphosis of Ezra: Jewish Apocalypse and Mediaeval Vision.\" JTS N.S. 33 (1982) 17f."},{"pageNumber":615,"pageContent":"dikazesthai en, \"presses suit against,\" in 2:6; pisteuei, \"let him believe,\" in 4:11; and apheis, \"you permit,\" in 4:34. The Greek style is inelegant and the single published manuscript often unclear or clumsy. The English translation, in such cases, is inevitably somewhat rough; efforts have been made to make it as clear as possible within the limits of faithfulness to the text. Such cases are particularly prominent in 2:16 and 3:11. Composition The Greek Apocalypse of Ezra as extant is a Christian composition in which a series of sources, Jewish and Christian, have been utilized.5 The whole has been put together in a somewhat crude fashion and the writing is characterized by literary unevenness and incon­sistency, repetitions, and a measure of incoherence. Many of these features are discussed in the following paragraphs, others are pointed out in the notes. The corrupt state of the Paris manuscript makes it possible that amelioration of the text by recourse to a broader range of witnesses might obviate some clumsy passages. Yet their abundance makes it unlikely that they are all the result of textual corruption. Furthermore, the careless nature of the final editor has on occasion resulted in a strange or fanciful utilization of a source which has led to an absurdity or at least a measure of the bizarre. For example, in 1:5, Ezra is said to fast for 120 weeks, a somewhat excessive period based on the seven one-week fasts in 4 Ezra. Other examples are found in the commentary. A study of the apocalypse enables the attentive reader to recover certain stages of the editor's work. It is best to start from the descriptions of heaven and Tartarus in chapters 4-5. In 4:5, very abruptly, Ezra asks to be shown \"the lower parts of Tartarus.\" He descends, with angels, and sees Herod (9-12), a fiery place of punishment (13-14), the disobedient (16-18), the unsleeping worm and consuming fire (20). By now he has reached the foundation of hell and is led to the south. He sees first \"hanging\" punishment there (22-24) and is then led to the north, where he sees the Antichrist, who is described in detail (25-33). In this connection a prophecy about the end-time is pronounced and its explanation given (35-43). Then, bracketed by two prayers for pity (5:1, 6), follows one more \"hanging\" punishment and a description of the terrors of hell (5: 2-4). The seer is then returned to heaven (5:7), where he sees many punishments and gives vent to his feeling of the futility of the birth of man (8-11). The wonders of conception and birth and their purpose are described (12-14). So far, at least on the face of it, the narrative is moderately coherent; 5:1-6, however, is a section that does not fit in its present position but would better follow 4:22-24. In 5:20-28 confusion reigns. In 5:20, Ezra asks to see punishments and Paradise. He is taken to the east (21) and sees Paradise and the righteous, some meteorological phenomena, and \"eternal punishments.\" Then, in 5:27, he is apparently back in Tartarus for he sees a \"hanging\" punishment and is led \"further down into Tartarus,\" where he sees the sinners mourning (5:24-28). This confusion is the result of the combination of diverse sources. The first source describes a descent into Tartarus (4:5-21); the seer descends to the lowest level of Tartarus, called apoleia, \"destruction.\" This section is straightforward and self-contained. The remaining types of material occurring here are also found combined in other apocalypses.6 These are (1) the descriptions of the \"hanging\" punishments; (2) the physiognomy of the Antichrist;7 and (3) the description of Paradise. These may have originally been represented by the following fragments: (1) \"hanging\" punishments: 4:22-25; 5:2-4 (5-7?), 8-11, 24-25 (26?); (2) Antichrist and prophecy about the end-time: 4:25-43; and (3) Paradise: 5:20-23. Fragment 1 in particular was broken up and combined by redactional links with the first source but, like fragments 2 and 3, it is of an indubitably ancient character. It is this redactional work that has caused the various inconsistencies in the text. This analysis finds considerable support from an examination of the Vision of Ezra, which contains another form of the \"hanging\" punishments, Tartarus, and Paradise material found in the Greek Apocalypse of Ezra. A 5 The problem of definition of Jewish and Christian materials in such works as this is referred to by R. A. Kraft, \"The Multiform Jewish Heritage of Early Christianity,\" Christianity, Judaism and Other Graeco-Roman Cults, ed. J. Neusner (Leiden, 1975) pp. 174-99, particularly pp. 184-87. 6 The best examples are to be found in the fragmentary Elijah apocryphon; see M. E. Stone and J. Strugnell, The Books of Elijah: Parts 1-2 (T&T 18, Pseudepigrapha No. 8; Missoula, Mont., 1979). 7 See further discussion, \"Theological importance.\""},{"pageNumber":616,"pageContent":"comparison of the two writings clearly indicates that they shared common sources but each used them differently. It may be observed further that 5:7-11 fits very well with l:7f. A difficulty of the latter passage is that it refers to the \"first heaven,\" where no more follow, while its references to \"judgments\" and to the voices of the wicked imploring Ezra's intercession are nicely complemented by 5:9-11 in which the sinners tell Ezra that \"since you came here ... we have obtained a slight respite.\" Both passages are typified by the seer's exclamation \"It were better that man was not born . . .\" (1:6; 5:8). Observe also that 1:9, Ezra's prayer on behalf of the sinners, is still in the first person with which the book opens. Ezra's speech is introduced in 1:10 and follows immediately upon his prayer in 1:9; but it is in the third person: \"And Ezra said.\" Again a clear sign of the literary \"seam\" can be discerned.8 A final observation in this connection is that 3:11-15 may be an originally independent piece of text as is indicated by the two second plural verbs found only there in the book.9 Original language It follows from the above that the writing was composed in Greek. Riessler suggested that the supposed Jewish source was written in Hebrew. His chief examples adduced to support this view are as follows: 1:20 contains a corruption of a hypothetical mdr to gdr; in 2:12 a supposed barah, \"to eat\" was confused with bara, \"to do\"; in 4:21, apoleia, supposedly from Hebrew sht, was misinterpreted in context; it should mean \"grave\"; in 5:23, kolasis is a mistranslation of pqwdh. All these examples are unlikely, unnecessary, or unconvincing. Most scholars correctly contend that the writing as extant is Christian and was originally written in Greek.10 Date and provenance The dependence of the writing on (presumably the Greek version of) 4 Ezra and its Christian character indicate a date sometime in the first millennium. If James is correct and this is the writing referred to in the Canon of Nicephorus (c. A.D. 850), then a date sometime between A.D. 150 and 850 is probable. Its provenance cannot be discerned.11 Historical importance and literary implications This writing clearly conveys no historical information in the ordinary sense of the word. In the broader context of Byzantine apocalyptic writing, it is an important witness of the way in which older Jewish apocalyptic traditions were taken over and reused by the Church. It may be appropriate in this context to observe that there are a number of other Christian compositions connected with this writing. One is the Armenian Questions of Ezra and another is most probably the Apocalypse of Sedrach (see the contribution herein). Other Ezra writings exist in Syriac, Ethiopic, Latin, and Greek. 1. Syriac Apocalypse of Ezra. It includes a vision of Four Empires, an account of the Antichrist, and other material.12 2. Ethiopic Apocalypse of Ezra. This Falasha work preserves details of judgment, historical prediction, and related legends. It is clearly dependent upon 4 Ezra and Jubilees. If the latter part is original, it was composed in Ethiopic. It does not belong to the cycle of Ezra books 8 It should be observed that the vacillation between first- and third-person narrative occurs frequently in the book. It indicates its composite and poorly authored character but cannot serve on its own as a criterion for literary analysis. 9 See nn. to 3:11-15. Riessier suggested that GkApEzra is a composite work containing an older Jewish source that has been Christianized. In his view, the Jewish sections are 1:1-3:10; 3:16-4:8; 4:16-21; 5:6-6:2 and the Christian passages are 3:11-15; 4:9-15; 4:22-5:5; 6:6-7:16. This analysis is incompatible with the analysis suggested above. See further in the next section. 10 Denis, Introduction, pp. 9If., presents a summary of views. 11 M. R.

Visio Bead Esdrae, \"The Vision of the Blessed Ezra.\" The Vision of Ezra belongs to the same body of literature as our Apocalypse of Ezra. It contains a fuller form of the descent into Tartarus and the \"hanging\" punishments, without the material on the Antichrist. Several features indicate it to have been translated from Greek; Mercati claims that there are almost no New Testament references in it.14 For the sake of clarity it should be noted that there are some references to the New Testament, particularly in the description of Herod's slaying of the infants. Thus no particular presumption of antiquity vis-a-vis the Greek Apocalypse of Ezra and the Apocalypse of Sedrach seems to follow. Many features of the apocalypse are lacking. 4. Revelatio Esdrae de qualitatibus anni, \"The Revelation to Ezra Concerning the Characteristics of the Year.\" This is an astrological treatise, presumably belonging to the same category of astrological-divinatory literature associated with Ezra of which Tischendorf gave some Greek excerpts and of which James noted some texts in Old English. To the Latin texts, Mercati added some fragments in Italian, while Nau discussed some futher Greek versions.15 Charles worth has recently drawn our attention to an astrological document in Syriac attributed to Shem which is similar to this document (see the contribution herein). 5. A Greek calendar of events of patriarchal history, combined with astrological portents and auguries arranged by days of the lunar month, is also attributed to Ezra.16 6. Finally, mention should be made of chapters 1-2 and 15-16 of 4 Ezra, which occur only in the Latin Vulgate. These chapters, fragments of which have been discovered in Greek, are sometimes called 3 and 5 Ezra respectively (see Metzger's contribution herein).17 Theological importance GOD God is mentioned in the work chiefly in dialogue with the seer. Ezra remonstrates with him, invoking his mercy (1:20, 12; etc.), and God responds, admitting his merciful character but insisting that he must punish the wicked for their sins. This idea returns throughout the first part of the work, and is perhaps most clearly expressed by the exclamation \"Your sins exceed my kindness\" (2:21). One of the sins against God is the crucifixion: \"they gave me vinegar and gall to drink\" (2:25; 7:1). This statement, of course, implies, as does 6:16 (cf. 6:17), a Christological view, but the book refrains from any reference to salvation through Christ. Other noteworthy Christian features are the mention of Paul and John (1:20) and of \"the Christian people\" (1:6; 2:7; 5:1; etc.), and the idea that Antichrist turned the stones into bread and water into wine (4:27). God is entitled usually \"Lord\" (passim), but he is also called \"Most High\" (1:2), merciful, greatly pitying one (1:10), and Father (2:22). He is associated with the cherubim (2:26) and is the one who drives the cherubim (7:6). He is opposed by Satan. The most striking feature of the concept of God is that he can be argued with. The seer can reproach him, remonstrate with him, and beseech him on behalf of mankind. This feature is inherited from 4 Ezra. 13 James, Fourth Ezra, p. lxxxvii, refers to its occurrence in BM Eth. No. 27.7, fol., 67a-71b, and BM Eth. No. 61.1, fols. l-7r. It was published with a French translation by J. Halevy, TPizdza Sanbat (Bibl. Ec. Hautes Etudes 137; Paris, 1902). 14 G. Mercati, Note di letteratura biblica e cristiana, pp. 70-73. Translation is found in Riessler, pp. 350-54. Denis concludes from the claimed absence of NT references that it is older than GkApEzra, ApSedr, and certain other works (Introduction, p. 93). In this he follows the view of Mercati, p. 66. P. Dinzelbacher, \"Die Vision Alberichs und die Esdras-Apokryphe,\" Studien und Mitteilungen zur Geschichte der Benediktiner-Ordens (Othobeuen, 1976) pp. 435-42, points to the older printing of an inferior longer rec. of the Visio B. Esdrae and some of its relationships in medieval apocalyptic literature. 15 G.

In 1:10; 2:10-11, 23, as also in 4 Ezra and the Apocalypse of Sedrach, God's direct responsibility for the creation of mankind is stressed (see 1:10 margin). The same idea also occurs elsewhere.18 This emphasis makes even more acute the seer's reproach of God for the perilous state of things. In 5:19 this concept is developed further: The world was created for the sake of mankind (see also 4Ezra 6:55; 7:11; 8:44; and 2Bar 14:19).19 Great emphasis is placed in the book on mankind's sinfulness and the rigor of their punishment. This stress is, of course, inherent to the seer's argument with God and is a sustained theme of the writing. Not only are the punishments of the sinners repeatedly stressed (1:7-11, 18; 4:9-20; 5:1-6), but the very point of the creation or birth of sinful mankind is repeatedly questioned. The expression of this theme derives from 4 Ezra (see 1:6 margin) and it recurs in various forms in many sources: for example, 2 Baruch 3:1, 4 Ezra 7:69, Babylonian Talmud cErubin 13b. Adam, who was created by God, sinned as a result of Satan's activity, although the name of Satan does not occur (2:12-14). The prophet's observation that without the creation of Eve by God, the serpent would not have deceived her, and that God creates and destroys whom he wishes (2:16f.), receives no response. The emphasis on Eve may be a reminiscence of the minimization of Adam's responsibility for the Fall to be found in the Adam books (contrast especially 4 Ezra 3:20f.). Mankind is weak and limited; their knowledge is such that they cannot answer divine challenges. This is expressed by a \"riddle\" question posed in 2:32: \"count the stars and the sand of the sea,\" to which Ezra responds that he, being merely human, finds this beyond his ability (3:2). A similar question occurs in 4:2 and the seer's response is likewise similar (cf. 4:4). These questions are clearly inspired by similar questions preserved in 4 Ezra (4:3-9 and 5:36-38). In the Bible the idea that the stars cannot be counted is commonplace, yet the number of stars was revealed to an apocalyptic seer in 1 Enoch 43:1-4 and in 2 Enoch 40:2-3. The use of such questions is extensive and goes back to biblical roots in Job and elsewhere. While using expressions designed to deny the possibility of men achieving secret knowledge, the Apocalypse of Ezra is in fact full of revelations of such mysteries, including natural phenomena (5:23).20 This situation naturally indicates a tension between the theme of mankind's limited nature (derived from 4 Ezra) and the disclosure of secrets to them (not from 4 Ezra). Yet the basic and pervasive concept is mankind's limitations. Humans are composed of soul and body; on death the soul leaves the body and departs for heaven, while the body returns to the earth (7:3). It would seem to follow, perhaps only by implication, that all those whom Ezra sees being punished are in fact the souls of the sinners. The contrast of the soul and body comes out most explicitly in the passage in 6:5-15 in which Ezra argues with the angel about giving up his soul. This theme—the unwillingness of the righteous man to yield up his soul—is widespread. The most extensive example preserved and one which resembles the Greek Apocalypse of Ezra in many ways is the Testament of Abraham, the whole of which is formed around this theme. In that work the angel fails to bring forth Abraham's soul, hence Death is sent. Different from the Greek Apocalypse of Ezra and the Testament of Abraham is Origen's description of the struggle between the good and evil angels over Abraham's soul (HLk 35). In the two former works the righteous man himself is the protagonist. Most recently J. T. Milik related the source referred to by Origen with the Visions of Amram from Qumran Cave 4. Be this as it may, the common theme of the Greek Apocalypse of Ezra and the Testament of Abraham also recurs in the Apocalypse of Sedrach 9, there sharing a source with the Apocalypse of Ezra. 18 2En 44:1; Alpha Beta de R. Akiba (A. Jellinek, Bet ha-Midrasch [repr. Jerusalem, 1938] vol. 3, p. 59): \"for the whole world was created by the speech of the Holy One, Blessed be He, and man by his hand\"; and ApMos 37:2; Philo, De somniis 210. 19 For similar rabbinic views see E.

Here he is called \"the prophet\" and not \"the scribe\"; this shift occurs either because of the later Christian tendency to make every biblical author into a prophet or because of his role as a recipient of visions. The selection of Ezra as the seer is due to 4 Ezra, the book which has inspired the present writing. In 6:5ff. Ezra is assimilated to Moses. This identification is found in other sources, of which some chief ones are: (1) the interpretation of 4 Ezra 14 as a second Sinai event; (2) rabbinic dicta such as that of R. Jose: \"Ezra was worthy that the Torah be given by him had not Moses preceded him\" (Tosefta Sanhedrin 4:7 and par.); (3) Armenian traditions developing this view.22 Many of the verses in which Ezra appears referred originally to Moses. The intercessory function which Ezra fulfills throughout the book bears a similarity to that of Enoch in 1 Enoch 12 (see Isaac's contribution herein). ANGELS Angels play a large role in the book. The cherubim associated with God were mentioned above. In addition to the tasks already mentioned, the cherubim guard the tree of life (2:14). A chief function of the angels in this apocalypse, however, is the common one of guide and interpreter for the seer. There is considerable variation in the names and titles of these guides: 1:3 Michael the archangel; 1:4 the archistrategos Raphael; 2:1 Michael and Gabriel and all the apostles; 4:7 Michael and Gabriel and thirty-four other angels; 4:24 Michael the archis­trategos; in 6:2 Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel, and five other angels with strange (some Greek-sounding) names are mentioned. In 4 Ezra it is Uriel who reveals the secrets; in the Vision of Ezra, Ezra is led to Tartarus by seven angels of Tartarus (1. 2) and to heaven by Michael and Gabriel (1. 79). The title \"archistrategos\" (1:4 and commentary) most frequently refers to Michael, as it does in older sources: Testament of Abraham; Joseph and Asenath 14; Daniel 8:11; 2 Enoch 22:6f.; 33:10f.; 3 Baruch ll:lf.23 In Sefer Zerubbabel (Even-Shmuel, Midreshe-Ge'ula, p. 73) variant readings are \"Michael\" and \"chief of the army of the Lord.\" The five strange names in 6:2 are not readily paralleled. Aker might be compared with *kyr in Sefer Harazim (ed. Margalioth, Index, s.v.) and an angel Zebuleon might conceivably be related to Hebrew zebul. In 1:7 reference is made to a \"great command of angels\" who come and lead the seer to the judgments. In 2:13 Adam is said to have been guarded by an angel, and the tree of life by a cherub. In 3:8 the angels are said to be destined to glorify God, and in 4:22 angels beat a wicked man. The nine angels in 6:2 are \"over the consummation.\" These tasks, like that of an angelic guide, are in no way extraordinary in a writing as late as the Apocalypse of Ezra. AFTERLIFE The book clearly foresees a final judgment, whose character is set forth in some detail (2:26). On that day there will be no rain upon the earth (2:29) but only merciful judgment (2:30). There is a strict judgment (see 1:16; 5:17; cf. also 2:30); God eventually will assemble wicked men in the valley of Jehosaphat and annihilate them and the world (3:5f.). Moreover, the book refers to the signs and portents that will precede that day, namely the breakdown 21 An extensive discussion of TAb and related issues is in M. R.

This is most clearly expressed in 3:12, where well-known language and literary forms are involved. The same occur, with some changes, in Armenian 4 Ezra 5:9; 6:4; and elsewhere (see Mt 10:21; IEn 100:1; Melito, Paschal Homily 51; Hesiod, Works and Days, 183-90; Ovid, Metamorphoses 1.144-46; m.Sotah 9:16; Tiburtine Sibyl 36f.).24 Next the Antichrist will appear. He is first mentioned in the book in 3:15, where it says that he will come up from Tartarus and show many things to men. In connection with the extensive Antichrist passage in chapter 4, reference is also made to the final judgment (4:36-43). This event is described in the following way: the Antichrist will come and perform signs by which he will lead astray the race of men (4:32-34). Then a trumpet will sound, the graves will be opened, and the dead will rise (4:36). The Antichrist will hide in the outer darkness and then heaven and earth and sea will perish—heaven will be burned for eighty cubits and earth for eight hundred cubits; this melting of the earth and men results because of the hiding of the Antichrist (4:37-39, 43). The idea of the burning of the heavens and the earth in a conflagration at the end of days is ancient and widespread; see, for example: Josephus, Antiquities 1.70; Philo, Vita Mosis 2, 263; Life of Adam and Eve 49f.; 2 Peter 3:10; and Agadat Bereshit (Jellinek, Bet ha-Midrasch, vol. 4, p. I).25 No exact parallel is known to the measurements given for the conflagration. The manuscript is sadly corrupt at the point where the sin of the heavens should be mentioned, but the sin of the earth is the hiding of the Antichrist. All of 4:25-43 is an extensive description of the Antichrist and his activities; Ezra has reached the lowest level of Tartarus. He sees a \"hanging\" punishment. Then he proceeds to the north, where he sees the imprisoned Antichrist. The chief themes expressed in this section are: 1. the imitation of Christ (4:27) 2. the danger of men being led astray (4:28) 3. the details of the physiognomy of the Antichrist (4:29-31) 4. the \"Lucifer\" theme (4:32) 5. the Antichrist becomes a child and an old man (4:33) 6. divine warning and the signs of the end (4:34-43): a. the trumpet (4:36) b. graves open and the dead rise (4:36) c. Antichrist hides (4:37) d. heaven, earth, and sea perish (4:38) e. heaven burns for eighty cubits and earth for eight-hundred and the reasons for this (4:39-43) A body of themes are gathered here that have old, widespread roots. The idea of the wicked king of the last generation may already be found in Ezekiel 28:2; Daniel 7:24f.; and that of the leader of the forces of evil in the last battle in 1QM 18:1; 1QS 4:18f.; Testament of Levi 3:3; Testament of Dan 5:6, 10f.; and Assumption of Moses 8. In the New Testament the term \"Antichrist\" is first encountered (Un 2:18, 22; 4:3; 2Jn 7). This figure is also probably the \"son of perdition\" and the \"man of lawlessness\" in 2 Thessalonians 2:2-4. A particularly Christian development is that the Antichrist will take on features in imitation of those of Christ in order to deceive men. This idea is clear in the Apocalypse of Ezra 4:27 and the warning against it comes out once again in 4:35. Another particularly clear example is in the Seventh Vision of Daniel, where the Antichrist is described as \"a wonder-worker having near him the souls of the lost, drawing bread out of stones,\" and giving sight to the blind. All this is said to be in resemblance (that is, of Christ). The passage concludes with a lament for those who believe in him. Earlier in the same section he is said to be born of an unholy virgin and to turn many away from the worship of God. The same theme may also be observed in the Coptic Apocalypse of Elijah 3:1-11 and other sources.26 24 P. J. Alexander, The Oracle of Baalbek (Washington, 1967) p. 10. 25 There are numerous texts giving lists of cosmic signs which will precede the end-time. Many such have been assembled in M. E. Stone, Signs of the Judgement, Onomastica Sacra and the Generations from Adam (University of Pa. Arm. Texts and Studies 3; Chico, Cal., 1981), pp. 2-57. Compare also the ApThom. For one text with widespread ramifications see W. W. Heist, The Fifteen Signs Before Doomsday (East Lansing, 1954). 26 E.g. the Seventh Vision of Daniel (see J. Issaverdens, The Uncanonical Writings of the Old Testament [Venice, 19341 p. 263). See ApEl in J.-M. Rosenstiehl, VApocalypse d'Elie (Textes et Etudes' 1; Paris, 1972) pp. 95-98."},{"pageNumber":621,"pageContent":"The description of the physiognomy of the Antichrist is to be found in a series of different sources. Most similar to the Apocalypse of Ezra (4:29-32) is the description in the Greek Apocalypse of Ioannis (according to Tischendorf, Apocalypses Apocryphae, pp. 74f.): The appearance of his face is gloomy; the hairs of his hand are sharp as missiles, his eyebrows like those of a wild man, his right eye like the star which rises at dawn and the other like that of a lion; his mouth (is as wide) as one cubit, his teeth a span long, his fingers like scythes; the soles of his feet (are) two span; and on his forehead (is) an inscription: \"Antichrist.\" He will be exalted up to heaven, he will descend as far as Hades, performing false apparitions. This description draws upon the same source as the Apocalypse of Ezra, and apparently not on the Apocalypse of Ezra itself.27 Another description is that occurring in a Greek fragment attributed to an Elijah apocalypse which has numerous parallel forms.28 Likewise, such descriptions are to be found in the Coptic Apocalypse of Elijah, which goes back to a Greek original, 3:12f.,29 in Sefer Eliyahu (ed. M. Buttenweiser, p. 16), in Sefer Zerubbabel (ed. Even-Shmuel, Midreshe-Ge'ula, p. 79), and in a series of other sources. This type of description of the features of the face and body, in combination with astrological indications of the character is to be found in 4Q186 (DJD, vol. 5, pp. 88-91). This is presumably to be related to Jewish physiognomic literature of a somewhat later date, Hebrew texts of which have been preserved.30 It should also be set in the broader context of the physiognomic literature in Greek, which is sadly fragmentarily preserved. The \"Lucifer\" features are the presumption of the Antichrist to set himself above God. The old mythical fragment in Isaiah 14:12-15 has had a decisive influence on later devel­opments of this theme. It is clearly found in the description of the \"little horn\" in Daniel 7:8, 20, 25, an important early \"Antichrist\" text. The theme of the primordial pride that led to the fall of Satan is clear in the Vita Adae et Evae and in certain later forms of this story.31 These features are appropriately assigned herein to the Antichrist. The relationship between these events and the punishments that Ezra sees in the course of his descent to Tartarus is not clear. The \"hanging\" punishments, typical of this section, are widespread, the two oldest texts dealing with them being the Apocalypse of Peter (22-24) and the Elijah apocryphon.32 They are also to be found in the Apocalypse of Paul 39f. and the Apocalypse of the Virgin 9f. Both these writings also contain material on the Antichrist, that in the Elijah apocryphon being a physiognomic description. These punishments might be seen, then, as forming an intermediate state between death and final judgment. This possibility is not stated, however, and their occurrence in the Apocalypse of Ezra may be due either to the combination of diverse sources or to the combination of just such material in 4 Ezra. The same factors have doubtless led to the confusion about the place of punishment, which is sometimes located in the heavenly spheres and sometimes in the abyss (see n. to 1:7). Relationship to canonical and apocryphal books While the Apocalypse of Ezra uses the biblical writings of both the Old and New Testaments, it is difficult to signal any particular biblical books with which it shows special 27 On further possible relationships of this description see W. Bousset, The Antichrist Legend, trans. A. K. Keane (London, 1896) p. 42. This work contains an invaluable study of the legend of the Antichrist and a wealth of sources are cited. 28 See Stone and Strugnell, The Books of Elijah, and the Gk. fragment published by F. Nau in JA 11 (1917) 454. The parallel texts are all adduced in the former work. See also J.-M.

The relationship of the work with 4 Ezra is intimate. First, the very form of the writing, a dialogue between the prophet Ezra and an angel (or God) in which the seer taxes his interlocutor with telling questions, doubtlessly derives from that writing.34 Second, a number of the topics raised are clearly taken from 4 Ezra, even though the Apocalypse of Ezra treats or expresses them differently.35 Such are not merely the questions about the purpose and nature of creation or the repeated calls for God's mercy, appealing to his own self-predication, but the \"riddle\" questions (2:32-3:2; 4:2-4; cf. 4Ezra 4:3-9; 5:36-38), the description of the development of the fetus (5:12f.; cf. 4Ezra 8:6-13) and of the messianic woes (3:11-14; cf. 4Ezra 5:1-13; 6:21-24; 9:3). In a number of cases there is more or less a literal use of the text of 4 Ezra (see margins),36 and many words and expressions strongly resemble 4 Ezra. Moreover, the literary framework is perfunctory, a fact which emphasizes the de­pendence of the Apocalypse of Ezra upon 4 Ezra. The Apocalypse of Sedrach and the Vision of Ezra are both closely related to the Apocalypse of Ezra and 4 Ezra.37 The Apocalypse of Sedrach has expressions in common with the Apocalypse of Ezra that do not occur in 4 Ezra, while nearly all its allusions to 4 Ezra also occur in the Apocalypse. It is, therefore, tempting to think of the Apocalypse of Sedrach as based on another form of the materials in the Apocalypse of Ezra, perhaps with some \"access to 4 Ezra.\"38 A similar situation was observed above to obtain as to the relationship between the Apocalypse of Ezra and the Vision of Ezra. The chief parallels between the Apocalypse of Ezra and the Apocalypse of Sedrach are noted in the margins (the references are according to James's paragraph division). The most striking parallel between the Apocalypse of Sedrach and 4 Ezra not found in the Apocalypse of Ezra is the passage about the choice representative of each kind (ApSedr 8; 4Ezra 5:23-27). There are also some parallels with the Armenian Questions of Ezra (see the contribution herein), but it seems unwise to state that the Armenian is \"a version of the apocryphon.\"39 The independent relations between the Questions of Ezra and the Apocalypse of Sedrach do indicate, however, that the Questions of Ezra belongs to the same literary tradition.

The title in the MS is4 'Treatise and Revelation of Esdras [Ezra] the Holy Prophet and Beloved of God.\" This title is frequently numbered as vs. 1. b. The date in years, but not that in days, derives from 4Ezra 3:1; this dependency explains why the phrase \"the thirtieth year\" appears without proper clarification. c. For the emendation behind this translation see Stone, \"Metamorphosis of Ezra.\" d. The seventy weeks are perhaps inspired by the prophet's seven weeks' fasting in 4Ezra and 2Bar, in both of which a week's fast intervenes between each vision. e. Archistrategos—lit. \"commander-in-chief of an army\"—is an angelic title most frequently used of the angel Michael; cf. Introduction. f. The significance of this gift to the seer is unclear. M. Himmelfarb has drawn my attention to the storax rod of the pearl merchant in the Acts of Peter and the Twelve Apostles (CG VI, 1) 2:25. g. The legal character of Ezra's disputation with God here and below (see margin) may derive from expressions such as those in 4Ezra 7:19. See also ApSedr 3. h. This expression, drawn from 4Ezra, recurs a number of times in GkApEzra. See margin. i. This reference to a first heaven probably re­flects a source which contained a vision of a number of heavenly spheres. Here in GkApEzra the sinners are said to be punished in the heavens (cf. 5:7-11, 24-26; 2En 7:10). This is confused with another view placing the place of punishment in Tartarus or the abyss. See in detail Introduction. j. This title has become commonplace in late pseudepigrapha. k. The word \"elevated\" is supplied only for the sake of translation. B. Violet's suggestion that phroureisthai, \"guarded,\" should be supplied on the basis of 4Ezra 7:85f. seems gratuitous. The idea that the vision of the punishment of the sinners is part of the reward of the righteous, and the reverse, is found in 4Ezra 7:83-86, 93f.; 2Bar 51:5. Cf. 4Ezra 7:38. 1. Here, in 2:10f., 23 and in various places in 4Ezra and ApSedr (see margin), it is stressed that God himself is directly reponsible for the creation of man not with his word, but with his very hand. See also the note to 5:19. m. The Gk. word for \"merciful\" is uncommon, but occurs in certain sources in connection with polyeleas, \"greatly pitying,\" as a rendering of the divine attributes listed in Ex 34:6f.; Jonah 4:2; Joel 2:13; Ps 86:16. See Introduction and n. 34. n. \"To punish\"—lit. \"to be punished.\" o. The sense of the Gk. verb (epituchein) is difficult here. The translation follows a suggestion of T. Korteweg; for the sense see 6:22. Korteweg would read artou for autou preceding, but for the absolute use, see Jas 4:2. p. For the image of the wage, a common one also in the NT, see 4Ezra 8:33.

The idea that mankind cannot sustain God's wrath is analogous to 4Ezra 8:34. where it says that man, being corruptible, is not a fitting object of divine anger. r. Riessler suggests that these vss. are an inter­polation. They do seem to interrupt the course of the dialogue and, more notably, are divine speech following directly upon divine speech. s. In Gk. only the beginning of this word is preserved by the MS and the restoration is uncertain. 2 a. Clearly this vs. is not a response to vs. 2 nor a continuation of it. It appears that the speaker must be Ezra, and that more than the introductory for­mula, which has been restored here, was actually lost. b. The sense is obscure here. ApSedr 3 has \"the son has a Iawsui{ with [?] the father\" (cf. Plato, Euthyphro 4e). Apparently Abraham is invoked to testify about some specific past case of a son press­ing suit against his father, but it remains uncertain to which event reference is made. Abraham's dia­logue with God about Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen 18) does not seem to fit here. c. The expression \"immaculate hands\" is com­mon to GkApEzra and ApSedr in connection with the creation of man but does not occur in 4Ezra. d. Or \"the food of the tree of life\"; cf. Walker, ANF 8, p. 571. 4Ezra does not mention any task assigned to Adam in the garden of Eden. The Bible (Gen 2:15) says \"to till it and keep it.\" In Gk­ApEzra 5:21 the tree of life is in the East, i.e. in Eden (Gen 2:8). Cf. IEn 24:3f. e. He who established disobedience is Satan. The vs. is not a response to the question in vs. 10. T. Korteweg suggests the loss of something like \"And the prophet said, 'Why are we now separated from the tree of life?' And God said ...\" This may have been due to scribal error. The text lying behind the translation is discussed in detail in Stone, \"Metamorphosis of Ezra.\" f. Vita 33:If. reports that Adam and Eve had guardian angels and the Fall took place at the hour when these angels had ascended to heaven to pray. This is related of Eve alone in ApMos 7:2. ApSedr 8 relates that angels guarded Adam continually. g. Tischendorf has numerous emendations for vss. 14f.; nearly all are accepted. See in detail Stone, \"Metamorphosis of Ezra.\" h.

The vs. is difficult. The Gk. actually reads \"memorial of writings.\" The text reflected by the translation is as emended by Tischendorf but he has not avoided all difficulties, notably the nominative case of \"father.\" The vs. might be emended to \"through the recollection of Scripture, O my Father, you measured out Jerusalem and rebuilt her.\" This would be better Gk. and does not require very extensive tampering with the transmitted text. Yet it does involve accepting four distinct changes in it and, at the present stage of textual knowledge (see n. g above), perhaps Tischendorf s more con­servative suggestion is to be preferred. The actual statement is somewhat odd, if the reference is to be the pseudepigraphic background of Ezra, for he was one of those responsible for the rebuilding of Je­rusalem. Perhaps our author was thinking of the angelic guide in Ezek 40-48 and the angel in Zech 2:5-9. The underlying idea may be that God, who, in accordance with the scriptural promises of res­toration, rebuilt Jerusalem in his mercy, will also have mercy upon the sinners. j. The Gk. ptosis is used in EpBar 6:9 much as it is here, apparently meaning \"creation.\" k. The Gk. has four corrupt words here that can­not be read. Tischendorf emends, dubiously, to \"and not then.\" This is certainly a Christian ref­erence. The apparent denial of divine mercy, jus­tified by citing the crucifixion as evidence for the wickedness of mankind, seems strange. In ApPaul 44 a similar reproach precedes Christ's statement that he will grant some respite to the suffering sinners. 1. God's cherub throne; cf. e.g. Ezek 1. m. Certainly a corrupted text based upon 4Ezra 7:39-42, where the phenomena of nature are said to be removed on the day of judgment. Aploan (Tischendorf, Apocalypses Apocryphae, p. 75) speaks of the removal of dew, clouds, and winds. It is unclear why GkApEzra should have singled out the rain alone from this list. Compare, however, the Daniel Apocalypse according to A. Vassiliev, Anecdota Graeco-Byzantina Pars Prior (Moscow, 1893) p. 47. The statement in vs. 30 is strange. In 4Ezra great emphasis is laid upon the view that, although divine compassion and human prayer can bring forgiveness and mercy in this age (most strik­ingly in 7:106-12), the day of judgment will be characterized by the strictest divine justice. This is particularly clear in 4Ezra 7:33, the latter part of which might have been misunderstood by Gk­ApEzra. In fact, in 1:16 and 5:17 GkApEzra refers to strict judgment. The same view as in 4Ezra is also found in 2Bar 85:12. Compare also TAbr, rec. A, 13. See also the note to 5:10. Walker's trans­lation (ANF 8, p. 572) is \"for such is the day of judgment as that in which there is no rain upon the earth; for it is a merciful tribunal as compared with that day.\" This is barely possible on the basis of the Gk. n. The similarity between these questions and those in 4:2-4, the answers to which are beyond human knowledge, and those in 4Ezra 4:3-9 and 5:36-38 is noted in the Introduction. They come to show the limitations of man, yet of course GkApEzra is actually full of special revelations, including meteorological ones in 5:23. 3 a. This vs. stands in evident contradiction with vs. 3. Compare Mk 13:32: \"But of that day and hour no one knows.\" b. The import of these vss. is unclear.

Tischendorf* s emendation of this phrase sies-mouptosin, \"the falling . . . through snaking,\" to seismon eis ptosin, \"shaking for falling,\" is re­jected. The phrase is difficult to translate. e. The picture of internecine strife given in vs. 12 is a commonplace; see Introduction. On the verbs in vss. 12f., see Introduction. f. Although this list is related to that in vs. 12, it stems apparently from a different source as is indicated particularly by the phrase \"nor slave upon master.\" This phrase occurs in 4Ezra 7:102-4 and not in the other passages that probably stand behind vs. 12. 4Ezra 7:102-4 proclaim that on the day of judgment no man, however intimately related, will be able to pray for his fellow. In GkApEzra, in­tercessory prayer has become \"to have mercy upon.\" The original intent of the verses is preserved in the Ethiopic Ezra Apocalypse (cf. Hal6vy, TPtzaza Sanbat, p. 182). g.

Other sources are collected by S. Lie-berman, \"On Sins and Their Punishment,\" L. Ginz-berg Jubilee Volume (New York, 1945) vol. 2, p. 258 (in Heb.). The particular punishment in GkApEzra here is paralleled in certain of the me­dieval Heb. sources he cites. f. Is the description of the Antichrist introduced following this section because of his title \"Son of Perdition'' (apoleias) derived from 2Thes 2:3? This title is not found in GkApEzra, but see the Daniel Apocalypse, published by Vassiliev, Anecdota Graeco-Byzantina, p. 43. See in general Bousset-Keane, Antichrist. g. The Gk. word is rare. Lampe (Patristic Greek Lexicon) offers \"the twelve last plagues of hell\" with no further support (cf. also Aploan in Tis­chendorf, Apocalypses Apocryphae, p. 94). h. The Gk. word here, katecho, is that generally used for the imprisonment or restraint of the An­tichrist; see 2Thes 2:6, 7 and the remarks of Viel-hauer according to HSW, vol. 2, pp. 614f. i. The Antichrist claims to be Christ and per­forms his miracles; see Seventh Vision of Daniel (Introduction), Cop. ApEl 3:1, 8-10. There is de­nied him only the resurrection of the dead. Cf. also the Daniel Apocalypse published by Vassiliev, Anecdota Graeco-Byzantina, p. 43. j. The idea that the purpose of the revelation of the signs of the Antichrist is that the seer might warn men against him is also to be found; e.g. Cop. ApEI 3:2ff. k. The chief physiognomic descriptions are noted in the Introduction. They do not bear partic­ular resemblance in detail to what we find here except for Aploan. The same style and the same literary type are, however, clearly observable. Note the \"high\" soles of his feet in Sefer Eliyahu, p. 16. 1. See the discussion of this theme in the Intro­duction. It is also prominent in the Vision of Enoch the Just (ed. Issaverdens, Uncanonical Writings, pp. 245f.). m. This detail also recurs in the Cop. ApEl, 3:14. Its source and significance are not clear. See also Tiburtine Sibyl 190-92 (Alexander, Oracle of Baalbek, p. 113, n. 54). The matter is discussed with suggestions as to its origins in Bousset-Keane, Antichrist, pp. 150-53. n. The trumpet announces the redemption; see Isa 27:13; Zech 9:14; Mt 24:31; IThes 4:16f.; Did 16:6. The closest parallel is, however, ICor 15:52, upon which GkApEzra depends entirely. The graves are opened and the dead arise un­corrupted. This is the general resurrection of the dead and not the grisly portent which is the falling of the dead bodies from their graves. This latter is to be found in Signs of the Judgement XI (Stone, Signs of the Judgement, pp. 26f.) and probably also in Mt 27:51. The sources for the resurrection are manifold, but here, again, GkApEzra seems directly dependent on ICor 15:52. Parallels to these two events in later literature are abundant and are not cited."},{"pageNumber":629,"pageContent":"38 the terrible threat, will hide himself in the outer darkness.0 -Then the heaven and 39 the earth and the sea will perish.p 'Then I shall burn the heaven for eighty cubits 40 and the earth for eight hundred cubits.\" «And the prophet said, \"And (in) what 4i,42 did the heaven sin?\" #And God said, \"Since [. . .] is the evil.\"4' »And the prophet 43 said, \"Lord, (in) what did the earth sin?\" »And God said, \"Since the opponent having heard my terrible threat will hide (in it), and because of that I shall melt the earth and with it the rebel of the race of men.\"r Further punishments i,2 5 And the prophet said, \"Pity, O Lord, the race of Christians.\" -And I saw a i* 3 woman suspended and four wild beasts were sucking upon her breasts.3 »And the angels said to me, \"She begrudged giving her milk but also cast infants into the 4,5 rivers.\" *And I saw terrible darkness and night without stars or moon. • There is there neither young nor old, neither brother with brother nor mother with child nor 6 wife with husband. •And I wept and said, \"O Lord, Lord, have mercy upon the i:i5 sinners.\" Ezra taken to heaven 7 And as I said these things a cloudb came and seized me and took me up again i:7f. 8,9 to the heavens. #And I saw many judgments and I wept bitterly and I said, »\"It i:6,2i;5:i4 10 were better if man did not come forth from his mother's belly.\" -Those who were 41^4*2; in punishment called out, saying, \"Since you came here, holy one of God, we ^io'o16 11 have obtained a slight respite.\"0 »And the prophet said, \"Blessed are they who bewail their own sins.\" Birth and its purpose 12 And God said, \"Hear Ezra, beloved one!

If vs. 43 is correctly understood, the \"outer dark­ness\" must be somewhere on earth since the earth is burned in order to melt the hidden Antichrist. The term occurs in contexts not particularly sig­nificant for the present text in the NT (Mt 8:12; 22:13; 25:30). In a context not unlike the present it occurs in QuesEzra, rec. A, 3; cf. also ApPaul 16. p. There is some contradiction here between the perishing of heaven, earth, and sea (vs. 38) and the burning of heaven and earth to various measures (of breadth? of depth?) in vss. 39-43. A similar contradiction is to be observed in the Arm. version of Signs of the Judgement between the signs cited below: 1. Heaven, earth, and sea perish; cf. Arm. Signs of the Judgement VII. 2. Heaven is burned for 80 cubits and earth for 800; cf. Signs of the Judgement XIV. Earth is burned for 30 (variant 33) cubits: ApDaniel published by Tischendorf, Apocalypses Apocry­phae, p. xxxii, and Vassiliev, Anecdota Graeco-Byzantina, p. 47; Eth. Ezra Apocalypse according to Hatevy, TP&zaza Sanbat, p. 178; and 8,500 (variants: 500, 1,800, 660, 30) cubits in Aploan 14 (Tischendorf, Apocalypses Apocryphae, p. 81); 72 cubits Cop. ApEl 3:83. The idea of a general conflagration at the end of days is found in quite early sources; see Josephus, Ant 1.70; Philo, VitaMos 2:263; Vita49f.: cf. 2Bar 70:8; 2Pet 3:10. The idea has been attributed to Stoic origins. q. The sin of heaven is unclear due to textual corruption. r. The sin of the earth is that in it is hidden the rebel (for the title compare Vision of Enoch the Just [ed. Issaverdens, Uncanonical Writings, pp. 246f.]). 5 a. Cf. ApVirg 20, where this punishment is re­corded for a different sin, one of ecclesiastical character. The first sin here appears to be comple­mented by the punishment, although a second sin has been added. The ecclesiastical character of the sins in ApVirg indicates that work to be later in character than GkApEzra. See also 4:13f. (margin) for a similar case. b. The idea of a cloud taking the seer up to heaven occurs elsewhere, e.g. IEn 14:8; Aploan (Tischendorf, Apocalypses Apocryphae, pp. 71, 93); TAb, rec. A, 9, 15; rec. B, 8, 10, etc.; cf. Isa 19:1 (of God). c. The view that the prayer of the righteous can be instrumental in gaining some respite for the suffering sinner is, of course, clear in TAb and ApPaul 44. It also bears on the concluding section of QuesEzra. The term for respite is not that of ApPaul, regarding which see Lieberman, Ginzberg Volume, vol. 2, p. 252; see 2:30 n. d.

ROBBINS Although this pseudepigraphon is thoroughly Christian1 and has as its closest parallels certain New Testament apocrypha,2 its place within the Old Testament Pseudepigrapha is assured for two reasons: (1) its attribution to the figure of Ezra; and (2) its affinities with the other Ezra-related pseudepigrapha, most notably 4 Ezra, the Greek Apocalypse of Ezra, and the Apocalypse of Sedrach.3 The Vision opens abruptly. Unlike the Greek Apocalypse of Ezra, there is no preparation for the petition that Ezra makes in the first verse: \"Grant me, O Lord, courage that I might not fear when I see the judgments of the sinners.\" That Ezra will receive a vision of the damnation of the wicked is presupposed. His entreaty is scarcely uttered before he is transported by seven angels of hell to the infernal regions. The series of visions commences with Ezra's arrival at the fiery gates of hell (vss. 3-11). Here Ezra sees the just passing untouched through the flaming portals. When the damned attempt to do likewise, they are ripped apart by the dogs (or in some MSS, lions) that lie in front of the gates and are consumed by the fire. It is a recurrent feature of the vision that the just pass through the infernal regions unscathed, whereas the damned are unable to escape. After passing through the gates, Ezra begins his descent into Tartarus. The account of this descent is fuller (vss. 12-55) than that of the Greek Apocalypse of Ezra. He sees the torments of adulterers, both men and women (vss. 12-18); of incestuous mothers and sons (vss. 19-22); of those who failed to make confession, who were niggardly in almsgiving, who were inhospitable to the sojourner (vss. 23-26); of Herod, on account of his slaughter of the holy innocents (vss. 37-39); of false teachers (vss. 40-42, 45-47); of unchaste virgins (vss. 43f.); of unjust rulers (vss. 48f.); of disrespectful children (vs. 50); of unfair masters (vs. 50); and of women who murdered the children they conceived in adultery (vss. 51-55). Having witnessed all the \"judgments of sins,\" Ezra enters into Paradise. Escorted no longer by the angels of hell, but rather by Michael and Gabriel (vs. 56), he catches a glimpse of the heavenly habitations and their splendor. Before placing him in the presence of God, the angels of heaven beg Ezra to plead the case of the sinners whose punishments he has recently witnessed. Ezra does intercede on their behalf, but is assured by God that they are receiving \"according to their works\" (vs. 61), just as the elect, who made good confession, who were penitent, who gave alms freely (vss. 26, 64), receive theirs, i.e. \"eternal rest\" in the kingdom of heaven (vss. 64, 66). Texts The Vision of Ezra is preserved in seven Latin manuscripts, which date from the eleventh 1 Cf. vss. 10 (the Lord's day); 37-39 (Herod and the slaughter of the infants in Bethlehem); and the numerous allusions to the NT noted in the margins (see also \"Relation to canonical books\"). 2 E.g.

While at least three of these may be considered major witnesses, the present translation is based upon a manuscript preserved in the Vatican Library, Vat. lat. 3838, fols. 59a-61a (12th cent.; referred to below as V).4 This text is to be preferred because its language is closer to the earlier, classical Latin than any of the other manuscripts, which suffer from numerous vulgarities of language, syntax, and spelling common to the medieval period. They also are interpolated at five points in the narrative. At least one of these interpolations could not have been possible before the late sixth century, which rules out any claim that the manuscripts in which it appears represent the original form of the document.5 The second and third major witnesses both represent this longer, interpolated tradition. Their alternate readings and additions are included in the notes to the translation. The first of these witnesses is a twelfth-century manuscript from Heiligenkreuz, Austria, Codex 11, fols. 272b-73a (referred to below as H).6 The second witness to the longer traditions is MS AI/6 (Hs 1) from the Bibliothek des Priesterseminars in Linz, Austria (11th cent.; referred to as L below).7 Manuscript L is distinct from the remainder of the manuscripts in that Ezra speaks in the first person.8 In addition to the above, O. Wahl has recently discovered in Austria four new manuscripts that contain the Vision of Ezra: (1) Klosterneuburg, Stiftsbibliothek, Codex 714, fols. 139ba-41ba (12th cent.; referred to below as K); (2) Lilienfeld, Stiftsbibliothek, Codex 145, fols. 70aa-70bb (13th cent.; referred to below as Lf); (3) Melk, Stiftsbibliothek, Codex 310.F.8, fols. 208b-9b (13th cent.; referred to below as M); and (4) Lilienfeld, Stiftsbibliothek, Codex 134 Klein-Maria-Zell, fols. 109ab-10aa (13th cent.; referred to below as Z).9 These manuscripts contain innumerable textual variants, few of which significantly alter the sense of the three major witnesses. The variants are primarily spelling differences, word omissions and transpositions, and minor additions.10 Original language There is almost unanimous agreement that the extant Latin of the Vision of Ezra is a translation from an earlier Greek tradition.11 Two points favor this conclusion: (1) the tangible literary kinship with the Greek Apocalypse of Ezra (see the contribution by M. E. Stone herein) and the Apocalypse of Sedrach (see the contribution by S. Agourides herein), both extant in Greek;12 and (2) variations within the witnesses to the Vision itself, which are most easily explained as variant translations of a Greek original.

O. Wahl has also noted a few verses that he claims represent Semitisms, most notably verse 7 (cf. also vss. 17, 21): bonum desiderium desideraverunt, \"they desired a good desire.\"13 Wahl makes no explicit claims that these few examples represent evidence for a Semitic original, yet his mention of them implies that the possibility might be entertained. Such a possibility is doubtful for two reasons: (1) the previously mentioned literary rela­tionships to works known only in Greek, and (2) the likelihood that phrases like desiderium desideraverunt may be biblicisms or \"Vulgatisms\" (cf. Ps 115:14) rather than Semitisms. Date and provenance There are no historical allusions in the Vision of Ezra that would yield an approximate date for the work. Given the numerous allusions to the New Testament, especially the Herod episode (vss. 37-39), the earliest possible date would be the late first century A.D. That a medieval work, the Vision of Alberich, is literarily dependent both on the shorter (MS V) and the longer versions of the Vision (MSS H and L), which would mean that they had to be available prior to A.D. 1111, the latest possible date would be the early twelfth century (even earlier if the eleventh-century date of MS L is accurate).14 The upper limit may be reduced slightly to allow time for the original to circulate in translation before being interpolated. This seems especially applicable here, as the Latin translations witness to both a longer and a shorter tradition. The lower limit may be raised for two reasons: (1) the Vision lacks many features of classical intertestamental apocalyptic works such as 4 Ezra and 2 Baruch; its features are derivative, not originative; (2) the Vision shares features, such as the \"hanging\" punishments and the journey through the underworld, with many New Testament apocrypha. While no literary dependence need be postulated, the Vision certainly shares the Zeitgeist, \"ethos,\" of their era, the third and fourth centuries A.D. For these reasons, the Greek original of the Vision of Ezra, whose Latin translations assured it an important role in later medieval literature, should probably be dated from A.D. 350-600. Apocalyptic works, especially those that do not recount history and do not have other historical allusions, are nearly impossible to locate geographically and culturally. All that may be said in the case of the Vision of Ezra is that it is a Christian document of unknown origin circulated in medieval times in the West.15 Historical and theological importance It is a commonly held notion that, by the beginning of the second century A.D., apoca­lypticism had died out in Christianity. As the early Church attempted to come to grips with the continued delay of the Parousia (the second coming of Christ), with waning hopes for an imminent end of history, and with the implications this realization had for a longer-than-anticipated institutional life, the apocalyptic tradition, it is argued, a tradition inherited from Judaism and incorporated into the very fabric of the Church's daily existence, its worship and its authoritative writings, was largely abandoned.16 As recent studies have shown,17 such an opinion cannot be maintained. While apocalyptic expectations underwent numerous transformations, both in content and in the manner in 13 Wahl, Salesianum 40 (1978) 586. 14 Dinzelbacher, Studien 87 (1976) 440. 15 Ibid., 435-42. 16 B. McGinn, in Visions of the End: Apocalyptic Traditions in the Middle Ages (New York, 1979) p. 16, quotes M. Werner as the foremost proponent of this view: \"The delay of the Parousia of Jesus, which after his Death became increasingly obvious, must, in view of the non-fulfillment of the eschatological expectation, have grown into a problem which was conducive to the transformation of the original eschatological doctrine.\" See Werner, The Formation of Christian Dogma (New York, 1957) p. 22. 17 E.g. J. Pelikan, The Emergence of the Catholic Tradition, 100-600 (Chicago, 1971) pp. 123-32; N. Cohn, The Pursuit of the Millennium, rev. ed. (New York, 1970); and McGinn, Visions."},{"pageNumber":637,"pageContent":"which those expectations were given expression, apocalypticism remained a vital component of the Catholic faith not only in the patristic period but throughout the Middle Ages as well. In the second through the fourth centuries A.D., those hopes were preserved and fostered by such writers as Irenaeus, Commodian, and Lactantius. Even those early Church Fathers who were opposed to overt apocalypticism—Eusebius, Jerome, Augustine, and Tyconius—wit­nessed to its resiliency, and often served as sources of information for later medieval views with which they would have found little sympathy. B. McGinn18 has noted that classical apocalypticism had twin offspring. On the one hand, a visionary literature was produced which increasingly centered on the fate of the individual soul, on the personal afterlife, with a detailed account of the pains of hell and the joys of heaven. Although such visions could exhibit the common eschatological pattern of crisis, judgment and salvation, and include speculation about the career of the Antichrist, interest in history as a unitary structure was not strong. On the other hand, there also existed a variety of texts more closely linked to apocalyptic proper which evinced explicit historical concerns, especially a view of the present as a moment of supreme crisis, and a fervent hope of an imminent judgment that would vindicate the just. Texts of the latter sort frequently, though not invariably, incorporated concern with the structure of history, usually in terms of a theory of world ages. The Vision of Ezra can best be understood as belonging to the first of McGinn's categories, to that visionary literature which laid stress on the personal afterlife. Unlike the Greek Apocalypse of Ezra, to which it is clearly related, the Vision of Ezra makes no mention of the Antichrist. Christ himself is referred to only obliquely (vss. 38, 46). There is no concern for the number and duration of the ages of the world or with Christ's thousand-year reign (Rev 20:4-6). Nor does the document address itself to an impending eschatological crisis. Rather, the primary concern of the Vision of Ezra is the punishment of sinners, the contrast between their torments and the beatitude of the just. The punishments and rewards in the afterlife correspond directly to the sin(s) or good deed(s) wrought on this side of the grave. Moreover, God's judgment of the sinners is unimpeachable. When Ezra bewails humanity's fate before God, God thunders back with the central theme of the Vision: \"In my image I have formed man and I have commanded that they not sin, and they sinned. Therefore they are in torments\" (vs. 63; cf. GkApEzra 5:12-19; ApSedr 4). How does such a vision function in the life of a community? Sociologists are inclined to view millenarian movements as agents of social change, as prepolitical phenomena, at times as protorevolutionary ones. The literature they produce functions, then, as a critique of social, political, and economic institutions. But if the Vision of Ezra is not a millenarian text, as we have argued above, then the sociological stereotypes used to characterize such literature probably will not apply. McGinn has correctly observed that apocalypticism is broader than either millenarianism or messianism, and its literature can have more than one function.19 Though he does not discuss this document, the Vision of Ezra aptly illustrates McGinn's point. By correlating as it does the punishments and rewards in the afterlife with actions committed in the earthly sphere, the Vision confronts us with an apocalyptic tradition intended to support and recommend the existing values and mores espoused by the institutional C-urch. The Church of the seer, opposing reprobates within and without, will not compromise its long-held demands of almsgiving, fidelity in marriage, confession, hospitality, chastity, ight teaching, the just use of power, and respect of parents. Rather, by means of the Vision, those values receive divine imprimatur, eternal validation. The elect who \"go into eternal rest\" do so on account of \"confession, penitence, and largesse in almsgiving\" (vs. 64), by maintaining the Church's ethical norms. To do otherwise is to \"sin\" (vs. 63) and \"enter into judgment\" (vs. 65). Relation to canonical books Beyond the name, Ezra, the Vision displays no contact with the canonical books of the Old Testament. Mercati also claimed that there were practically no New Testament references 18 McGinn, Visions, pp. 14f. 19 Ibid., pp. 28-36. McGinn's critique and corrective of Cohn's analysis of medieval millenarian movements and those of other anthropologists who study millenarianism in primitive societies are trenchant. We are indebted to him for the remarks that follow."},{"pageNumber":638,"pageContent":"or allusions in the Vision.20 M. E. Stone (see contribution herein) has rightly noted that there are indeed some references to the New Testament discernible in the text. He cites the description of Herod's slaughter of the infants (vs. 38 = Mt 2:16-18) as a clear example. It may be that, in this instance, the Vision is relying more on the Greek Apocalypse of Ezra (4:9-12), which also mentions Herod in this context, than on the New Testament directly. The emphasis placed on largesse in almsgiving (vss. 7, 26, 31, 64) probably derives from injunctions in Matthew 6:2-4, but especially in Acts 9:36, 10:2, and 24:17. The doctors of the Law in verse 46, \"who were teaching with words, but they did not spur on to work,\" bear resemblance to the scribes and Pharisees in Matthew 23:1-7, \"who sit on Moses' seat,\" who \"preach but do not practice.\" In verse 57b of manuscript H, \"those who altered the last things and spoke false testimony\" suffer the sort of fate Revelation 22:19 promises for the \"one who takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy.\" Other allusions are noted in the margins and in the notes to the text. Relation to apocryphal books The strongest and most consistent links with any other apocryphal works occur between the Vision and the other literature of the Ezra cycle: 4 Ezra, the Greek Apocalypse of Ezra, the Questions of Ezra, and the Apocalypse of Sedrach.21 But even these links, with one notable exception, are not close enough to postulate any theory of literary dependence one way or the other. They all share in the Zeitgeist of the collapse of classical apocalyptic during the fall of the Roman Empire. All share, to varying degrees, the pessimism of their progenitor, 4 Ezra, and are built around the figure of Ezra and his complaints against God. These complaints are somewhat muted in the Vision of Ezra. There is really only one complaint in the Vision of Ezra (paralleled in the Greek Apocalypse of Ezra): that the animals are better off than humans because they are not required to praise God yet do no sin (vs. 62). The one episode in the Vision of Ezra that is closely paralleled in the Greek Apocalypse of Ezra is the scene in which Herod is seated upon a throne and being tortured (VisEzra 37-39; GkApEzra 4:9-12). In this one instance literary dependence could be posited, but the brevity and singleness of this example, coupled with the elusiveness of establishing dates for the two documents, leave the question open as to which document served as the source for the other.22 Numerous other parallels exist between the Vision and the Greek Apocalypse of Ezra (especially 4:5-5:6), but, again, these are general in nature and preclude any attempt to establish priority. The situation in this regard is further complicated by the parallels all the Ezra literature displays with the New Testament apocryphal works (ApPet, ApPaul, ApVirg, VisPaul). The common features include the journey through hell and heaven and the \"hanging\" punishments of the sinners in hell (cf. the marginal references). It is unlikely that any theory of literary dependence would account for the similarities; often individual sins and their punishments occur in different combinations in all the documents. Cultural importance It has been noted repeatedly that Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, the supreme literary creation of the Middle Ages, bears striking resemblance to the apocalyptic literature of its own and earlier centuries. What were the sources for Dante's compelling vision of inferno, purgatorio, and paradisol Surprisingly, the Vision of Ezra may be put forward. P. Din-zelbacher has recently demonstrated that the medieval Vision of Alberich, a treatise recognized by Dante scholars since its publication in the early nineteenth century as a sure source and inspiration for Dante, had itself relied on both shorter and longer recensions of the Vision of Ezra.23 20 Mercati, Note, p. 66. 21 Cf. Mttller, \"Die Griechische Esra-Apokalypse,\" JSHRZ 5.2 (1976) 88; Wahl, Apocalypsis Esdrae, pp. 2-7. For a general survey of extant Ezra literature, cf. R. A. Kraft, \" 'Ezra' Materials in Judaism and Christianity,\" ANRW II. 19.1 (1979) 119-36. 22 Mercati, Note, pp. 65-68, has suggested that VisEzra may be older than the GkApEzra and ApSedr.

STONE The Questions of Ezra is a work that purports to relate a dialogue between the prophet Ezar and the angel of the Lord. The subject of the dialogue, which survived in two recensions, is the fate of the souls of men after death. The prophet asks about the fate of the righteous and sinners—the righteous are destined, he is told, for \"great joy and eternal light\" and the sinners for \"the outer darkness and the eternal fire\" (vs. 3). Next follows Ezra's question about the fate of the sinners and the fact that nearly all men are sinners. What will be the fate of the souls, he asks, immediately after death (vs. 10)? A page is missing from the manuscript of one recension at this point, but from the second it can be surmised that there followed a discussion of the purpose of creation and the temporary places of the sinners (they are imprisoned by demons in the lower atmosphere) and the righteous (they rise to the Divinity in the upper atmosphere). There follows a characterization of the seven steps up to the Divinity and of the guardians of the divine throne (vss. 19-30) abounding in vivid and bizarre descriptions. The freeing of the souls from the hands of Satan through expiatory prayers is then discussed and, in recension B, the document concludes with a prediction of the resurrection and final judgment. Texts The Questions of Ezra is extant in two textual forms. The first is that published by Yovsepciancc in his edition of the Armenian apocrypha1 and first translated into English by J. Issaverdens.2 Yovsepciancc based his edition on a single manuscript, a Mastocc (Ritual), manuscript number 570 of the Library of the Mechitarist Fathers in Venice.3 The manuscript was written in A.D. 1208, and the Questions of Ezra occurs on folios 203r-206v. In the present translation a second form of the Questions of Ezra is added to the published information. This is found in the Menologium (Lives of Saints) of the Armenian Church, in the fourth recension thereof, that was printed in Constantinople in 1730 (pp. 424-25).4 This printed text was compared with that of a seventeenth-century manuscript in the Bodleian Library, Oxford (MS Marsh 438, vol. 3, fol. 402). No major differences were to be observed between these two witnesses.5 The Venice text is here given first as recension A and the Menologium text as recension B. B differs from A in several respects: 1. It is much shorter but, even where the texts are parallel, it contains a number of details not in the longer A text. 1 S.

It seems to preserve text in two places where there is a physical lacuna in A: following verse 10 of A and following verse 40 of A. 3. It lacks verses 11-30 of A. Original language and date There is insufficient evidence to determine whether the writing was originally composed in Armenian or whether it was translated into Armenian from another language. Possible arguments based on literary considerations will be adduced in the next section. There seems no clear basis for establishing the date except to say that the writing is a Christian composition clearly based on Jewish models. There is no indication of provenance. Composition and literary affinities The Questions of Ezra should be viewed in the context of the apocryphal Ezra literature. Its general inspiration derives clearly from 4 Ezra, which may also have provided certain patterns of the questions posed. (See the marginal notes to the translation.) The amount of verbal parallelism is very limited, however, and decisive evidence whether dependence is on the extant Armenian version or on the lost Greek version of 4 Ezra is unclear. The contacts between the two writings are shared general ideas and not direct parallels. Special note should be taken of the seven steps or ways of ascent of the souls in the Questions of Ezra A 19-21, and the similar material in 4 Ezra 7:81-98. Beyond this, however, the very dialogue style and the subject matter indicate the dependence on 4 Ezra. The general resemblance to the Greek Apocalypse of Ezra is also quite striking; both writings center on questions about the fate of the souls and share the dialogue form. The Latin Vision of Ezra is another form of this writing. The third body of apocryphal Ezra material with which the Questions of Ezra should be related is the extensive expansionary passages found in the Armenian version of 4 Ezra. These passages are dialogues on various theological issues inserted into the dialogue of 4 Ezra.6 Taken together, these writings constitute a fairly extensive body of literature, inspired by 4 Ezra and preserved in the Armenian tradition. (The apocryphal Ezra writings in various languages are discussed in the Introduction to GkApEzra.) In a study of the Questions of Ezra published in Armenian in 1898, B. Sargissian pointed out certain parallels between it and two other Armenian texts, the Inquiries of St. Gregory the Illuminator and the Martyrdom of St. Kalistratos.7 He published the chief parallels with these writings in his work. Both contain dialogues concerning the fate of the souls of men. Sargissian is of the opinion that the Inquiries of Gregory is later than the Questions of Ezra of which he knew only recension A, but that the Martyrdom of Kalistratos is an Armenian translation of an older Greek source that may also have served the Questions of Ezra.8 Although the Martyrdom of Kalistratos contains closer verbal parallels to the Questions of Ezra than does the Inquiries of St. Gregory, it also has close parallels with this latter work. It is by no means certain, however, that this implies that it served as a source for the Questions of Ezra.9 This is particularly so in view of the affinities of the latter with the Ezra literature noted above, as well as with the text of recension B. Concerning the composition of the writing, Sargissian suggests that the section A 31-40 is a later addition to an older description of the heavens. Moreover, he considers this older description to have some features in common with Zoroastrianism. This theory requires reevaluation in view of the new information to be gained from recension B. On the basis 6 See the publication of one such dialogue: M. E. Stone, \"Some Features of the Armenian Version of IV Ezra,\" Le Muse'on 79 (1966) 395-400. A translation based on an inadequate text may be found in Issaverdens, Uncanonical Writings, pp. 361-501. See now M. E. Stone, The Armenian Version of IV Ezra (Univ. of Pennsylvania Armenian Texts and Studies 1; Missoula, Mont., 1979). 7 B. Sargissian, Studies on the Uncanonical Writings of the Old Testament, pp. 452-82 (in Arm.). The text of parts of the Inquiries of St. Gregory is on pp. 465-69; that of extracts from the Martyrdom of St. Kalistratos is on pp. 475-78. The latter may also be found in P. Awgerian, Complete Lives and Martyrdoms of the Saints (Venice, 1810-14) vol. 6, pp. 489-94 (in Arm.). 8 Sargissian, Studies, pp. 469-77. 9 The final resolution of these issues must await the full publication of the Arm. texts involved."},{"pageNumber":646,"pageContent":"of a comparison of the two recensions it may be suggested that the cosmological description from verses 16 to 30 is derived from a separate source, although the supposed Zoroastrian features are not as striking as Sargissian thought. This section is not represented in B. The comparison of A and B thus seems to imply that two source documents are involved. The first contained the dialogue between the prophet and the angel concerning the fate of the souls. It comprised six parts: (1) A 1-10; (2) the section upon which B 4 is based, which fell in the lacuna after verse A 10; (3) A 11-15; (4) the section upon which B 6 is based; (5) A 31-40; and (6) a section corresponding to B 10-14. The second document comprised the dialogue about the ascent of the soul corresponding to A 16-30. This section is distinctive in its views and contains a pastiche of ideas drawn from older sources. This analysis would contradict the view of Sargissian referred to above, for it is clear that the discussion of the fate of the souls belonged in the same document as the indubitably Christian section dealing with the freeing of the souls from Satan. This means that the writing as extant is Christian; but it probably draws upon older sources. The point in its development at which the description of the ascent of the souls was combined with the dialogue about the fate of the righteous and the wicked is unclear. If recension B was based on a form of the text in which this section did not occur, then we must say that it was incorporated subsequently into the original composition. If, on the other hand, the epitomist of B simply left it out, as he did other isolated verses of A, then this material may go back to an older source utilized by the person who put the Questions of Ezra together in its present shape in recension A. The forty-day period of repentance (A 32) appears in a somewhat different form in another of the documents associated with the pseudepigraphical Ezra literature, the Apocalypse of Sedrach 13-14. In that writing there is emphasis on prayer and service of God that in general resembles that in the Questions of Ezra. This may, however, reflect merely a common concern and a similar response of monastic piety to similar issues (see vss. 3Iff., n. q). In the Introduction to the Greek Apocalypse of Ezra the relationship between the Ezra apocrypha is discussed. Theological importance The central issue of this document is the fate of the souls of men after death and at the end of time. This issue devolves naturally from certain assumptions about the nature of God as revealed in his dealings with men. On the first hand God requites the righteous and wicked after death for their actions. Emphasis is laid on the fact that this requital is just and fitting \"and those things in which God finds man, by those is he judged\" (B 4). Yet God's mercy is displayed; by means of prayer, repentance, and due memorial service, it is possible to gain release of the souls of men from the power of Satan who punishes them (A 31-36; B 9f.). According to A 16-30, God is seated in the highest heaven, surrounded by angelic hosts, and his glory is such that sinful man in his weakness can only approach the throne of God; even the angels cannot see his face (A 24-26). The throne of God is situated opposite the garden (the heavenly paradise), and there is sublime light (A 21). He is surrounded by seraphim who sing the Trisagion to him perpetually (A 24), a picture derived ultimately, of course, from Isaiah, chapter 6. Man is sinful and only the martyrs who died in tortures for the sake of God are seen to be righteous (A 7). The details of the cosmological view of the document, based as it is on common hellenistic assumptions, have been set forth in the notes to A 16-20. There are seven heavenly spheres, the lower ones characterized by evil, negative traits, the upper ones by fiery, positive ones. Hell is in the third sphere. The soul of the righteous is led by an angel through these spheres until it reaches the presence of the Divinity. Apparently, in A 16, various fearsome and dangerous areas are described through which the soul passes with its angelic guide until it 10 The idea that the souls of the wicked find no rest until judgment, but wander about, is found in 4Ezra 7:80. This may have provided an impetus in the tradition for the introduction of these concepts, but the views are by no means identical."},{"pageNumber":647,"pageContent":"commences the ascent through the heavenly spheres. There is no suggestion of the inhabitants of the heavenly spheres beyond the list of the guardians around the divine throne (A 27-30). On the other hand there are two quite distinctive angelological views that should be mentioned. The first is the idea of the good and evil angels who will come after death to take the souls of the righteous and the wicked, respectively. This idea bears a certain resemblance to Zoroastrianism, as pointed out in the note to A 15; however, clear parallels in older Jewish sources and some later Christian ones are also shown to exist, but the view, as it occurs here, is not to be found exactly in any other source. The other view touches on demonology. In the description of the intermediate state of the souls in B 6, it says that the souls of the righteous rise to the upper atmosphere, while those of the wicked are imprisoned in the lower atmosphere, held by demons. This idea is not found in the ancient Jewish sources and it seems to represent an adaptation of concepts of hellenistic religion in which the atmosphere is thought to be full of semidivine beings both good and bad, and according to which the soul of the righteous rises to the supralunar spheres. These ideas have been taken over and adapted to a description of the intermediate state of the souls, between death and resurrection. The punishment of the souls of the wicked in this intermediate state is then thought to be in the hands of demons or of Satan (A 31-33; B 12).10 This indicates that the dualistic views in which there is a contrast between angels and demons, corresponding to the contrast between the righteous and the sinners, are well established in this writing. What is not clear is the extent of cosmic dualism. At one level, there is a clear contrast of the earthly sphere and the heavenly spheres above it. At another, there is the expectation of an end-time, which suggests an opposition between this world and that to come, But neither of these views is developed as a dominant one in the document. It is clear, from recension B in particular, that an end-time is expected, and that it is thought of in conventional terms. Gabriel will sound the trumpet, the souls will be reunited with the bodies, and the resurrected will pass in judgment before Christ at the time of his return (B 11-14). What is more distinctive is the view of the intermediate state, which includes the punishment of the souls of the wicked by demons in the atmosphere and the ascent of the souls of the righteous who will see the throne of God. The view of an intermediate state is derived, in general, from 4 Ezra, but here has received a special development. Cultural importance The Questions of Ezra is an interesting example of the development and Christianization of themes deriving from the great Jewish apocalypses of the period of the second Temple. The questions with which it deals, the fate of the souls of men and reward and punishment, are among those that have always aroused men to thought and speculation. This work is one of those developments that show the way in which various Christian churches developed and amplified themes of special interest to them. BIBLIOGRAPHY Charlesworth, PMR, pp. 117f.

The text contained by B 8 probably derives from the missing section (see Introduction). The Parousia is the second coming of Christ, expected to occur at the end of days. g. The idea of the impartiality of the day of judgment expressed in vss. 11-13 is prominent in 4Ezra, but it is formulated there in different terms: See4Ezra 5:42; 7:33-35.66, 102-15.

ApPaul 11-16 describes groups of good and evil angels who receive the souls of the righteous and wicked men: Cf. 2Bar 51:1-6; TAb A 17, B 13. The idea of personification of a man's deeds in the form of two women occurs commonly in Zoroastrianism; see J. Duchesne-Guillemin, La Religion de I'lran ancien (Paris, 1962) pp. 332f. This is not necessarily the direct source of the passage here. Other features of Iranian eschatology, notably the Cinvat bridge of testing, are noticeably absent. Cf. the rather different story in Xenophon (Memorabilia 2.1.20ff.). i. This observation may be compared with Ar­menian 4Ezra 8:62L, there emphasizing the essen­tial goodness of creation: \"That which was created for good, he did not use well and he (man) sinned. Not that I created anything evil, but everything which I created was very good; each thing which existed, existed for its own purpose, just as iron existed not that it might kill, but that it might work the ground and be of use to all.\" j. This description apparently refers either to the first part of the ascent through the heavenly spheres (see vss. 20-21) or, more likely, to some prelim­inary stage. The east as the direction in which the soul is led should be contrasted with GkApEzra 5:21 (see also n.). There east is the direction of Paradise. In IEn 22:1 Sheol is in the west (cf. also 23:1), while the gardens of spices are in the east (chs. 28-32) and Paradise in the north (ch. 32). In 2En, hell is on the northern side. The presence of the meteorological phenomena in the lower heavens is commonplace, e.g. 2En 5; TLevi 3:2. With the list of phenomena in 2En 40:1-11, cf. IEn 34; 41:3f. k. ApPaul 14,16 relates how the angels lead the souls to the presence of God. The idea of seven steps of ascent to the Divinity (which correspond to seven heavens) is widely known. On the seven heavens, see H. Bietenhard, Die himmlische Welt im Urchristentum und Spdtjudentum (WUNT 2; Tubingen, 1951) pp. 3-8, for the chief sources. The idea of the seven spheres that bear the planets and that form stages for the ascent of the soul is common in hellenistic thought, and these are some­times described as the steps of a ladder; see the sources assembled by H. Lewy, The Chaldean Oracles and Theurgy (Cairo, 1956) p. 413. The term \"lodging\" is not a common expression in this context but may perhaps be compared with \"hab­itations\" (used differently) in 4Ezra 7:80. The seven lodgings here are comparable with the seven \"ways\" or \"orders\" of the ascent of the soul after death in 4Ezra 7:80-98. Are the \"lodgings\" the same as the mansiones or \"way stations'' of Roman travel and route descriptions, such as the Peutinger Table? 1. In this description, the lower stages, appar­ently heavens, have a negative character. Such may also be observed in the description of the heavens, e.g. in 2En and 3Bar. Hell, in the sources that bear this character, is often in the third heaven, so 3Bar 4:1-6; 2En 10; TIsaac (apud G. H. Box, Testament of Abraham [London, 1927] pp. 67-70). The idea of hell's being associated with icy cold may be compared with TLevi 3:2; ApPaul 42. The description in this vs. is paralleled by that in vs. 22, which refers to terrors, quarrels and wars, burn­ing heat. A similar series of terms also occurs in vs. 28—\"quarrels, wars, burning heat\"—but there it is preceded by \"thunders, earthquakes.\" The \"burning heat\" of vss. 22 and 28 is not referred to in vs. 20, and the term may refer to the fiery environs of the Godhead; cf. Dan 7:9-10; IEn 14:19; 71:5-6; etc. Alternatively it might refer to hell, but then it would be in the wrong position in the series. The \"thunder\" and \"earthquakes\" of vs. 28 are not echoes of anything in either vs. 20 or vs. 22. The heavenly repositories of meteoro­logical phenomena are widely known. Elements of this description may be drawn from 4Ezra 3:19, in which vs. God's descent on Sinai is described: \"And your glory passed through the four gates of fire and earthquake and wind and ice.\" In the present text only \"wind\" is missing. Cf. also the order of elements in the list of revealed things in 2Bar 59:11—innumerable angels, flaming hosts, splendor of the lightnings, voice of thunders, chiefs of the angels, treasuries of light, etc. m. The glory of God is also the climax of the ascent of the souls through the seven \"ways\" or \"orders\" according to 4Ezra 7:87, 98, and else­where."},{"pageNumber":651,"pageContent":"God cannot be seen 22 The prophet said to the angel, \"My lord, when you cause him to pass through 20,28 such terrors, through quarrels, through wars, through burning heat, why do you not cause him to meet the Divinity, rather than causing him to approach only the 23 throne?\" •The angel said to the prophet, \"You are one of the foolish men and you 4Ezra4:io-n 24 think according to human nature. • I am an angel and I perpetually serve God, and I have not seen the face of God.

The Arm. word occurring at this point is unknown and does not have a clear etymology. Sargissian (Studies, pp. 470f.) suggests that the word manasruank' derives from Avestan manah + sravha, apparently supposed to mean \"beautiful spirits.\" A forced Arm. etymology might be de­rived from the stem man-, \"spin,\" and the word sur, \"sword,\" i.e. \"those of spinning swords.\" The rest of the strange terms in this vs. and in the latter part of vs. 28 seem to refer to classes of angels, but they are unparalleled in the descriptions of the guardians of the divine throne.

The words from \"thunders\" to \"burning heat\" appear to be out of place. The list of beings surrounding the throne of God is distorted by these features that apparently appertain to the lower heav­ens; see vs. 20, n. p.

FIENSY The Revelation of Ezra is a kdlandologion,1 or almanac describing the nature of the year depending on the day of the week on which the year begins. Natural conditions such as rainfall and drought, the severity of winter, and the abundance of crops can be predicted; while the fate of national rulers can also be foreseen. Text G. Mercati2 edited three Latin manuscripts in 1901 that purported to be revelations of Ezra. His oldest manuscript (MS A),3 which is translated here, was produced in the ninth century.4 Original language There is no reason to conclude that this text is a translation. Grammatical and syntactical evidence is lacking for a Greek or Semitic original.5 The original language, then, is probably Latin. Date The latest possible date for this text is the ninth century, since the earliest extant manuscript comes from that period. However, kalandologia were obviously composed prior to the ninth century and had become very popular by that time. Nicephorus (c. 806-15) condemned the use of certain \"profane\" books, among them branto/ag/a,6 rc/evw^ Thus the composition of this text may have been well before the ninth century. 1 See A. A. Sophocles, Greek Lexicon of the Roman and Byzantine Periods (Cambridge, 1914) p. 621; F. Boll and C. Bezold, Sternglaube und Sterndeutung (Leipzig, 1931) pp. 159, 186. 2 Note di letteratura biblica e cristiana antica, pp. 74-79. 3 Palat. Lat. 1449, fol. 119M20. 4 Mercati's MSS B and C (which are actually later recs.) date from the 12th and 15th cent, respectively. For Gk. MSS see F. Boll, F. Cumont, G. Kroll, and A. Olivieri, eds., Catalogus codicum astrologicorum Graecorum (Brussels, 1898-1932). The kalandologia listed in it attributed to Ezra range from the 12th to the 16th cent., three hundred or more years after Mercati's MS A. Although these texts are similar in form to the Lat., they are altogether different compositions. 5 It must be asked whether the document is a translation due to the many astrological texts extant in Gk. (see Boll et al., Catalogus) and to the numerous Heb. and Ar. astrological texts that were translated into Lat. See K. Kohler, *'Astrology,\" JE, vol. 2, pp. 241-45, and the bibliography given there, especially M.

The work is evidently the product of a Christian, since the author uses the expression \"the Lord's Day.\" Historical importance The Revelation of Ezra demonstrates the importance of Ezra as an astrological figure. It was probably due to the popularity of 4 Ezra9 that \"Ezra\" became the most common pseudonym for prognosticators in the Middle Ages.10 In addition to the Latin manuscripts edited by Mercati there are numerous Greek texts11 as well as English and Old French prognostications that claim Ezra as their author.12 Relation to non-canonical literature13* The Revelation of Ezra is strikingly similar to the Treatise of Shem. Both documents attest to the same belief: The beginning of the year determines the nature of the year. The difference between the two is that in Shem it is the zodiacal sign that determines the year, while in Ezra it is the day of the week. If Shem was composed in the first century B.C. (see the contribution in this volume), it may be the prototype of the genre to which the Revelation of Ezra belongs. The Revelation of Ezra also bears a resemblance to the Testament of Solomon. As Solomon became for Jews the magician par excellence, so at a later period Ezra's name was associated with astrology and he became for Christians (and perhaps for Jews) the prognosticator par excellence. The best parallels to the Revelation of Ezra are other medieval kalandologia. A Latin text attributed to Bede14 and several anonymous Greek kalandologia15 are extant in addition to those attributed to Ezra cited above. Although they differ in details, they are identical in structure.16 They begin with something like: If the first of January is on Sunday, such and such will occur during the year. The formula is then repeated for each day of the week. The authors share the same interests: the success of the harvest, the weather, wars, plagues, and the fate of national rulers. 9 According to M. R. James, The Fourth Book of Ezra (T&S 3.2; Cambridge, 1895) p. lxxxix. 10 See Boll and Bezold, Sternglaube, p. 175, who say that although the names Aristotle, Melampus, Adam, David, and Solomon were used, Ezra's name was most popular. 11 Gk. astrological texts similar to our Revelation of Ezra (and attributed to Ezra) are cited and extracted by: C.

A NEW TRANSLATION AND INTRODUCTION BY S. AGOURIDES The Apocalypse of Sedrach begins with a sermon by Sedrach on the necessity of unfeigned love and on its paradigmatic expression in the sacrifice of the Son of God. At the conclusion of the sermon, Sedrach hears the voice of an angel and is taken up into the presence of the Lord. Sedrach asks the Lord why the world was created, and when the Lord replies that it was created for man, Sedrach reproaches him for the condition of man in the world. Sedrach's objections are centered on the problem of evil in the world, while the answers offered by the Lord in reply to Sedrach's charges are centered on man's own responsibility for evil. In the end, Sedrach pleads that the Lord will be merciful to men. At this point, the Lord directs his only begotten Son to take the soul of Sedrach and place it in Paradise. Sedrach resists the attempt with a series of questions and lamentations. Christ reminds Sedrach that he has been promised Paradise, but still Sedrach resists, for he is concerned with the fate of sinners. The Lord promises Sedrach that if a man lives a hundred years of sin and then repents for only three years, he will be saved. Then Sedrach, with the help of the archangel Michael, gradually persuades the Lord to reduce the required period of repentance to twenty days. Having been thus satisfied, Sedrach allows his soul to be taken to Paradise. Although the word \"apocalypse\" is not found in either the title or the body of the text, the ascent of the seer into heaven to speak with God face to face certainly justifies the classification of this work as an apocalypse. The seer is identified only as Sedrach; but, since the only Sedrach known to Byzantine writers was the character from Daniel 3:12, it is probable that he is intended as the author. Text The Apocalypse of Sedrach is preserved in only one fifteenth-century Greek manuscript, which is located in the Bodleian Library: Cod. Misc. Gr. 56, fols. 92-100. The text was published in part by M. R. James.1 James omitted as irrelevant to the main theme of the work the largest part of the sermon on love with which the manuscript begins. The text published by James was translated into English by A.

Original language There is no reason to doubt that Greek was the original language of the Apocalypse of 1 I am grateful to the editor and his staff for polishing this introduction. M. R. James, Apocrypha anecdota, pp. 130-37. 2 A. Rutherford, \"The Apocalypse of Sedrach,\" ANF, vol. 10, pp. 175-80."},{"pageNumber":659,"pageContent":"Sedrach. The extant Greek text is replete with patristic and Byzantine vocabulary and syntax, although elements of modern Greek also appear. Date Although there is general agreement that the Apocalypse of Sedrach dates, in its final redacted form, to the Byzantine period, the probability that the apocalypse is shaped out of much earlier material is accepted by most scholars. It is the opinion of M. R. James and A.-M. Denis that the Apocalypse of Sedrach received its final form around the tenth or eleventh century A.D., but that the author drew upon materials which extended back to an earlier age.3 M. E. Stone and J. H. Charlesworth have argued that the materials so used must have dated from the early centuries of the present era.4 Much of the doctrinal content of Sedrach is atypical of medieval Christianity and many other elements of the Apocalypse are more Jewish than Christian (see below, \"Provenance\"). Where \"Christ\" is briefly mentioned, the term seems to be a substitute for the name of the Jewish archangel Michael. While no precise dates can be given, it appears that the Apocalypse was originally composed between A.D. 150 and 500, and that it was joined together with the sermon on love and received its final form shortly after A.D. 1000. Provenance The Apocalypse of Sedrach appears to be from a Jewish original for the following reasons: First, the role of Sedrach as explorer of the divine will and mediator for divine compassion does not fit the Christian tradition of either the earlier or later period. In popular Christian tradition this role is attributed to Mary, the mother of God. For example, in the Apocalypse of Mary, she travels through hell, sees the torments of the sinners, and tearfully pleads with her son for them. As a result he grants them a respite of fifty days in Paradise between Easter and Pentacost. Second, the final period of twenty days' repentance agreed to by the Lord at Sedrach's pleading seems to be in conflict with much of later Church discipline. Most of the serious sins in the later Church require several years of repentance.5 Third, Christian elements such as the incarnation or the cross are conspicuously absent. Christ plays practically no role at all. He is sent for Sedrach's soul; but this motif probably originates with the role of Michael,6 who appears elsewhere in the text. The Christian redactor here has substituted the figure of Christ for the figure of Michael. Fourth, one can detect a change not only in content but in style, when moving from the first section to the last. The difference between the bombastic rhetoric of the sermon on love and the more subtle tones of the apocalypse itself is readily apparent. The contrast is accentuated by a sudden transition from the sermon to the ascent of Sedrach. All of these indicate that the author of the second section is not the author of the Christian homily. Fifth, the theme of man's debate with God is typically Jewish and the reluctant reduction of the period of penitence at the badgering of the favored seer qualifies as the leit-motif of the Apocalypse of Sedrach. Other Jewish features of the Apocalypse are the bat qol received by the seer, and the belief that the soul filled the entire body.7 The tradition about the creation of Adam and Eve, and their comparison to the sun and the moon, is typically Jewish as is also the angelology of this document. Finally, those things represented as most beloved by God are: \"among the rivers, (the) Jordan; among the cities, Jerusalem.\"8 It appears that the original Sedrach apocalypse was at some time put together with one or more Christian sermons on love, repentance, orthodoxy, and the second coming of Christ. In the course of time all but the sermon on love and the apocalypse itself dropped out, with the remainder of the collection still bearing the more inclusive title, but now being attributed to the main character, Sedrach. 3 James, Apocrypha anecdota, p. 128f.; and A.-M.

Meier relates in GenR 14:9. 8 ApSedr 8:2."},{"pageNumber":660,"pageContent":"It may be fairly stated that the sermon on love is a product of Byzantine Christianity and that the apocalypse itself originated in Jewish circles, but nothing further can be said about the place of composition. Theological importance The main theme of the Apocalypse of Sedrach is the love of God and his compassion for the sinner and full understanding of man's weakness. This theme ties together both the sermon and apocalypse portions of the text and gives them a thematic unity which M. R. James did not recognize. Particular emphasis is placed on the mercy of God, who reduces the period of repentance required of even the most inveterate sinner, and who, in a unique passage (14:5), grants salvation even to the unbaptized. The mercy of God, for the author of Sedrach, overcomes all confessional barriers if only man will repent. Even man's capacity to sin, the gift of free will, is granted to man as a result of God's unbounded love. Thus God's love and mercy are emphasized in three ways: first, in his granting to humans their freedom of choice; second, in his accepting of long-delayed repentance; and third, in his granting salvation to the unbaptized. The universalism evident in the unrestricted appli­cation of God's mercy to all is contradictory to most contemporaneous Christian views on the subject, and only serves to emphasize how thin the Christian veneer on this document is. The analogy of a prodigal son found in the apocalypse has a most un-Christian twist to it: The father does not forgive, but takes back the inheritance from the prodigal and casts him out. It is uncertain whether this analogy is related to the famous parable of Jesus, but if it is, it may represent a Jewish form of the parable that was later adapted by Jesus to make a different point. Finally, the description of the beauty of the human body ('*... your hair is known from Theman, your eyes from Bosra . . .\")9 and the lamentation over the prospect of separation from it would surely have brought a blush to the cheek of many Christian ascetics. Sedrach laments over the human body that decays in the grave as one laments over the body of his sweetheart. This glorification of the body seems anomalous with the ascetic ideal of later Christianity. Relation to canonical and non-canonical books Scholars recognize the indebtedness of the Apocalypse of Sedrach to the canonical book of Job, the Apocalypse of Baruch, and the Testament of Abraham. The most striking parallels, however, are to the book of 4 Ezra. James cites many resemblances in language and subject matter, and there is no question that the author of the Apocalypse of Sedrach has borrowed from 4 Ezra.10 There are major differences between Ezra and Sedrach. The latter is not set against a background of biblical events, not even those relating to the person of Sedrach. There is no eschatological interest about the end-time, and the national problems of the Jews are not mentioned. However, the main theme of the Apocalypse of Sedrach, namely, the compassion of God for the lost sinner, is also one of the main themes of 4 Ezra. The idea that man was created superior to the angels, who were invited to worship him, and that Satan's refusal to prostrate himself led to his exile from heaven, is found in the Life of Adam and Eve.11 The statement of J. H. Charlesworth that \"very little critical work has been published on this pseudepigraphon'' is woefully correct.12 A more complete introduction and a commentary to the text of Sedrach are needed. It is hoped that the present translation will stimulate further research on this rich but neglected document. 9 ApSedr 11:1. 10 James, Apocrypha anecdota, pp. 128f. 11 Vita (ApMos) 16. 12 Charlesworth, PMR, p. 178."},{"pageNumber":661,"pageContent":"SELECT BIBLIOGRAPHY Charlesworth, J.

Master, grant (thy) blessing. 1,2 1 Beloved, we must prefer nothing more than unfeigned love. «We commit many faults every hour, day and night, and for this reason let us acquire love, because 3 it covers a multitude of sins. 'What do we gain, my children, if we possess iPet4:8 4 everything yet do not have saving love? *How does one benefit, my children, if 1Cor 13:13 one gives a great banquet and invites king and nobleman and prepares every sort of expensive fare in order that nothing should be missing; nevertheless, if there is no salt, that banquet cannot be eaten; and one not only bears the expense but 5 one also wastes (his) efforts and is disgraced by the guests. »It is the same in our situation, my brethren; what will we profit, for what grace do we possess without 6 love? »Our every deed is false, even if one has virginity and fasts and keeps vigil 7 and prays and gives a banquet for the poor. #And if one brings gifts to God, or offers the first fruits of all his goods, or builds churches or does anything else without love, it shall be counted by God as nothing, for (these things) are not 8 acceptable. •Thus the prophet says: \"The sacrifice of the impious is an abomination Prov 15:8 9,10 to the Lord.\" °Do not be advised to do anything without love. #If you say, 47 hate my brother but I love Christ,'' you are a liar, and John the Theologian rebukes Un4:20 you, for how can one who does not love his brother whom he has seen, love God Un4:20 n whom he has not seen? *\\i is clear that anyone who hates his brother but thinks 12 that he loves Christ is a liar and is deluding himself. #For John the Theologian says that we have this commandment from God, that he who loves God should also love un 4:21 13 his brother. »And again the Lord himself says, \"Upon these two (commandments) 14 depend all the law and the prophets\" #Oh, how extraordinary and paradoxical Mt22:40 is the miracle that he who has love fulfills all the law; love is the fulfilment of the Rom n-.io 15 law. «Oh, power of love beyond imagination; oh, power of love beyond measure! 16 There is nothing more honorable than love, nor is there anything greater either 17 in heaven or on the earth. •This divine love is the capital (virtue); among all the is virtues love is the highest perfection in the world.8 »It dwelt in the heart of Abel; it worked together with the Patriarchs; it guarded Moses; it made David the dwelling 19 place of the Holy Spirit; it strengthened Joseph. #But why do I say these things? TJOS i7:if. 20 The most important is that this love brought the Son of God down from heaven. 21 Through love all good things were revealed; death was trampled down, Hades was made captive, Adam was recalled (from death), and through love one flock 22 was made thereafter of angels and men. •Through love Paradise has been opened; the kingdom of heaven is promised; the waste places it madeb (into) cities, and filled15 the mountains and the caves with song; it taught men and women who were 23 treading the narrow and sorrowful path. #But how long shall we prolong this sermon on the achievements of love which even the angels cannot accomplish? 24,25 Oh, blessed love which bestows all good things!

J. KLIJN Although the destruction of Jerusalem in 587 B.C. is given by the apocalyptist as the occasion for writing this work, it was in fact written after the fall of Jerusalem in A.D. 70. 2 Baruch is a work with varied contents consisting of lamentations, prayers, questions with answers, apocalypses with explanations, addresses to the people, and a letter to Jews in the Dispersion. The contents can be summarized as follows: 1:1-8:5. Jerusalem is destroyed by the Babylonians after the angels remove the holy vessels from the Temple. 9:1-12:4. After fasting for seven days, Baruch sends up a lamentation to God. 12:5-20:4. Baruch fasts for seven days. Questions follow concerning the usefulness of being righteous and living a long life with the answer that man must not direct himself to corruption. 20:5-30:5. Baruch fasts for seven days, and after praying, declares that God will finish that which he began. Twelve disasters are announced, followed by the coming of the Anointed One, the resurrection of the dead, and the final judgment. 31:1-34:1. Baruch warns the people that disasters will come before the end of time. 35:1-43:3. In the Holy of Holies Baruch receives a vision of a forest and a plain surrounded by mountains. The forest changes into a cedar; then he sees a vine and a spring. The vision is explained and those who will live to see its consummation are named. 44:1-46:7. Baruch speaks to the people about God's judgment. 47:1-48:50. Baruch fasts for seven days. In a prayer he expresses his conviction that everything is determined by God. 49:1-52:7. Baruch asks about the outward appearance of the righteous ones after the resurrection. 53:1-74:4. Baruch sees a vision of a cloud from which bright and dark waters alternately pour. The vision is explained. 75:1-77:26. Baruch thanks God, then speaks to the people a third time about the righteous ones who will be saved. 78:1-87:1. The work concludes with a letter to the nine and a half tribes in which the Jews of the Dispersion are exhorted to obey God's commandments and to trust in God. Text The textual tradition regarding chapters 1-77, the apocalypse proper, must be dealt with separately from that of chapters 78-87, the attached letter. The text of the apocalypse is known from one Syriac manuscript: Bibliotheca Ambrosiana B. 21 Inf. in Milan, fols. 257a-265b, dated from the sixth or seventh century. Three small excerpts are known from Jacobite lectionaries: BM Add. 14.686, dated 1255, fol. 77a, c. 1, 1. 14-77b, c. 2, 1. 9, contains 44:9-15; BM Add. 14.687, dated 1256, fol. 157b, c. 1, 1. 6-158a, c. 2, 1. 3, contains 72:1-73:2, and fol. 175a, c. 2, 1. 12-176a, c. 1,1. 1, also contains 72:1-73:2. A fourth portion is mentioned for the first time in D. Dedering's edition:"},{"pageNumber":669,"pageContent":"\"Pampakuda [in Kerala, India]. A. Konath Libr., MS 77. The MS is dated A.D. 1423: 44:9-15; 72:1-73:2.\"* Recently an Arabic version of the apocalypse has been discovered (Sinai No. 589), but the text has not yet been published. Preliminary observations show that this manuscript is a translation of a Syriac document, but probably not the same text as present in Bibliotheca Ambrosiana B. 21 Inf. The translation is rather free and thoroughly adapted to Muslim ideas. The recently discovered manuscript does not significantly improve our understanding of the Syriac text, but it is sometimes useful in evaluating conjectured improvements to the Syriac proposed by former editors of this pseudepigraphon. One fragment, verso and recto, is known in Greek among the Oxyrhynchus Papyri: 12:1-13:2 (verso) and 13:11-14:3 (recto) from the fourth or fifth century.2 There are thirty-six different texts of the letter, in Syriac. The translation below follows the text of Bibliotheca Ambrosiana, fols. 265b-267a, which is the letter as it is attached to the apocalypse. In the following translation, this text is indicated by the siglum c while the other manuscripts are cited according to the sigla presented in the List of Old Testament Pershitta Manuscripts? Only in a few cases are readings of other manuscripts preferred over c. Original language The heading of the Syriac text states that the document has been translated from Greek; the report is certainly true. The existence of a Greek version is proved by the fragment of this work discovered among the Oxyrhynchus Papyri (see also 3:6). The extant Greek is different from the Syriac and seems to be a free rendering. The Greek version, most of which is lost, appears to have been translated from Hebrew. An original Hebrew version should be accepted because of the many parallels between 2 Baruch and other Jewish writings composed in Hebrew or Aramaic. In some cases the Syriac text is intelligible only after translating it into Hebrew. Finally, a translation of Ihe Syriac text into Hebrew restores a play on words apparently contained in the original.4 Date Several passages help determine the probable date of the Apocalypse of Baruch. 32:2-4 states that \"after a short time the building of Zion will be shaken in order that it will be rebuilt. But that building will not remain because it will again be uprooted\"; finally a new Temple will appear that will last forever. In this passage two destructions are presupposed, indicating that the author lived after the destruction of the second Temple in A.D. 70. In 67:1, the author speaks about the disaster that befalls \"Zion now.\" In 68:5, he writes about the restoration of the Temple. If he assumes the view of Baruch, the author speaks about the destruction of the Temple in 587 B.C. and the building of the second Temple without mentioning its destruction. In that case the author used a source that has to be dated before A.D. 70. If, however, he is referring to the restoration of the Temple which probably took place in A.D. 130 during the time of Hadrian, then the \"last black waters,\" mentioned in chapters 69 and 70, might refer to the time of Bar Kokhba.5 In 28:2, it is said: \"For the measure and the calculation of that time will be two parts: 1 S. Dedering, Apocalypse of Baruch, p. iii. The present translation is based on Dedering's edition. The existence of an Ar. version of this work was announced by P.

Bientenhard, \"Die Freiheitskriege der Juden unter den Kaisern Trajan und Hadrian und der messianische Tempelbau,\" Judaica 4 (1948) 164-66."},{"pageNumber":670,"pageContent":"weeks of seven weeks.\" This passage is thoroughly unclear and cannot be used to arrive at a date of origin.6 The passage 61:7 is quoted in Barnabas 11:9, an indication that the author of Barnabas knew this work. It is, however, not quite clear when Barnabas was written. Two proposed dates are A.D. 117 and 132.7 These passages point to a date after A.D. 70, although the author probably made use of earlier sources. In this connection the relation with 4 Ezra is significant. If this work is dependent on 4 Ezra, a date around A.D. 100 is probable. A dependence, however, of both writings on a common source seems the most acceptable hypothesis. 2 Baruch is probably later than 4 Ezra, since it appears to show an advanced stage of theological development. Therefore, the Apocalypse of Baruch seems to come from the first or second decade of the second century. Provenance There are three reasons why this work was probably written in Palestine. The original language, Hebrew, indicates this region. Also, the work shows a close acquaintance with Jewish rabbinical literature. Finally, the author takes his stand with the inhabitants of Palestine, who, especially in the final letter, try to exhort and encourage the Jews in the Dispersion. Historical importance The work shows a composite character. The first part is characterized by certain, sometimes conflicting, traditions about the Temple. In chapter 4 the author used a tradition in which a new, already existing Temple from heaven will appear on earth. This differs from the tradition used in chapter 6 in which angels are sent from heaven to take away the vessels from the Temple in order to preserve them in the earth \"until the last times, so that you may restore them when you are ordered\" (6:8).8 Here a restoration of the second Temple is supposed. Both traditions about the Temple have parallels in Jewish literature before A.D. 70.9 They show that in the Jewish world many ideas existed with regard to the future of the Temple. But the author of this work was not himself interested in the Temple. The destruction was for him a suitable starting point from which to raise a general lamentation about Israel's fate after the disaster in 70. Subsequent to a narrative section the author starts, in chapter 10, a long passage in which Baruch speaks about Israel's sorrows but ironically does not mention the Temple. It is striking that in the final letter, the author speaks about the destruction and writes that the angels came from heaven to remove the vessels \"lest they be polluted\" (80:2), which only means that he does not expect a restoration of the Temple. An important part of the apocalypse is devoted to the three visions (27:1-30:5; 36:1-40:4; and 53:1-76:5). These visions contain the announcement of the appearance of the Anointed One, after whose appearance there will be a time of abundance. While the importance of the land of Israel is emphasized, nothing is said about the Temple. Here we are dealing with traditions which apparently predate A.D. 70. At the same time, we should note that the author inserts these visions into his work explaining them in his own way. In addresses to the people after the visions, he does not mention their contents. After the first vision (31:1-32:6), Baruch emphasizes that disasters will come at the end of time (31:5); in the address after the second vision (44:1-46:7), he tells the people that everyone will be judged according to 6 L. Gry, \"La Date de la fin des temps, selon les revelations ou les calcula du Pseudo-Philo et de Baruch (Apocalypse syriaque),\" RB 48 (1939) 337-56. 7 This depends on Barnabas 16:4, from which no certain conclusions can be drawn because its text is corrupt. 8 In PR 26:6 we read that an angel breached the walls of Jerusalem so that the enemies cannot boast that they have vanquished the city, but nothing is said about the holy vessels. See W. G. Braude Pesikta rabbati (Yale Judaica Series 18; New Haven, London, 1968) pp. 524, 534f. In 2Bar two traditions are brought together. 9 For the concept of a temple in heaven see IEn 90:28f.; 1Q32; 2Q24; 5Q15; 4QFlor; Tob 14:5; SibOr 5.402, 414-44; Jub 1:27-29. For the concept of vessels hidden in the earth, see 2Mac 2:4f."},{"pageNumber":671,"pageContent":"his work (46:6); and after the third vision (77:1-26), he says that the righteous ones will be saved (77:26). In the final letter nothing is said about an Anointed One. Here the author speaks about the corruptibility of the world, the final judgment, and the necessity of living according to the Law. From this we may gather that the importance of this work lies in the manner in which the author deals with traditional material. He knows of traditions concerning the Temple and the Messiah, but was not himself influenced by these ideas. He was impressed by the holiness of God and his inscrutable ways. He was convinced that God's judgment has confronted Israel and will come over the whole world; the only way to survive is to live according to God's commandments. Without losing his belief in a coming judgment, he has separated himself from all speculations about the way this judgment will arrive. Theological importance A description of the theological importance includes the traditions about the Temple; the apocalyptic parts of the writing; passages in which the author speaks by means of addresses, prayers, answers and questions; and the final letter. With regard to the visions, the following particulars are of importance: The Anointed One will be revealed after the tribulation, which will afflict the earth (29:3). In two of the visions the Anointed One shows a warlike character. He will execute the last ruler over the earth (39:7-40:2), allowing some nations to survive but destroying others (70:9 and 72:2). The first and the third visions present the idea of a great abundance on the earth after the appearance of the Anointed One (29:4-7 and 73:2-74:4). All the visions express the idea that the land of Israel will be protected during the culmination of the tribulations (29:2; 40:2; and 71:1). In the second and third visions it is revealed that the Anointed One will either judge or destroy the nations (39:7-8; 40:1; and 72:2). The rest of the work contains the following concepts: God is the creator (14:17; 21:4-5; 54:13; 78:3; 82:2) who rules his creation (21:5; 54:2-4) and will judge it in the future (5:2-3; 48:27, 39; 83:7; 85:9). God's government is not always evident because he is inscrutable (14:8; 21:9-10; 44:6; 75:2-5). However, he knows the times and periods and has appointed a day on which to judge the earth (21:8; 48:2; 54:1). He also knows the number of men on the earth (21:10; 23:4; 48:6, 46). He will fulfill everything he promised in the past (44:13; 83:5; 84:6), and he will avenge himself on the enemies of Israel (82:2, 4-9). He is merciful to those who show themselves to be righteous (24:2; 75:1; 78:13; 85:8). Israel is loved by God (5:1; 21:21; 78:3) but cannot be compared with the other nations since she was elected by God (48:20; 77:5). For that reason she is separated from the other nations (42:5). Israel has Abraham as her father (78:4) and is not mixed with the other nations (48:23). She has acquired for herself some privileges and received others: She possesses righteous men (14:7), the righteousness of the fathers (84:10), God's promises (78:7), knowledge (14:5), and the Law (48:24; 77:3). This has created more responsibility for Israel (15:6; 19:3). However, she did not sin in the same way as the other nations (14:5), although she trespassed certain of the commandments (1:2; 77:8-10). For this reason she will be punished for some time (4:1; 6:9; 13:9; 78:3; 79:2). Israel deserved this suffering (78:5; 79:2). Her punishment will be the destruction of the Temple and the Dispersion among the nations (1:4). However, all of this shows that God did not reject his people, and the disasters reconcile her sins (13:9-10). Therefore, Israel should rejoice in her sufferings (52:6). After the destruction of the city, Israel has nothing left other than God and his Law (85:3), which will last for ever and ever (77:5). Some Jews separated themselves from Israel (41:3) and mixed themselves with other nations (42:4); they will be rejected. Those who live according to the Law will be gathered together (78:7), will take part in the resurrection of the dead, and will enjoy life on a new earth (30:1-2). The Law is a lamp given by Moses (17:4) on the occasion of the establishment of the covenant (19:1). The Law illuminates (38:1-2; 54:5) and divides between life and death (46:3). Darkness is the result of Adam's sin (18:2). Everyone is free to choose between light"},{"pageNumber":672,"pageContent":"and darkness (54:15, 19; 85:7). He who chooses to live according to the Law will receive eternal life (32:1; 38:1; 48:22; 51:3, 4-7; 54:15), the good things (44:7), and grace and truth (44:14). The Law should be explained and expounded (3:6; 46:3) and will last for ever and ever (46:4; 77:16). Wisdom and intelligence are given in order to scrutinize God's Law (44:14; 46:5; 48:24; 51:3), and to understand God's actions, especially those at the end of time (54:5). But many wise men will be silent at that time (70:5; cf. 48:36). The Law has to be learned (32:1; 84:1—9) so that Israel will live according to God's will in the future (44:3; 46:5; 82:6). The nations have rejected God's goodness (13:12). Although they know that they act unrighteously, still they resist God (82:9). They have become \"their own Adam\" (54:15, 19). They may live happily (12:3-4; 82:3-9) and boast before their own gods (5:1; 7:2; 67:2; 80:3), but, in fact, they served the God of Israel when they destroyed Jerusalem (5:3; 7:2-3). They acted out of their hatred for Israel (3:5); therefore, they await unknowingly their just punishment (5:1; 12:4; 13:5-7; 48:32). They dispersed Israel, but this will benefit both of them (1:4; 41:4). Only a few individuals have joined Israel (41:4f.; 42:5), but eventually all nations will be subjected to Israel (72:5). The world was created by God because of man (14:18), the righteous ones (15:7), or the Patriarchs (21:24). Death rules over all men because of Adam's sin (17:3; 19:8; 23:4; 48:42-43). Therefore, life is a struggle (15:8; 16:1) and full of pain (48:50). Nothing is more bitter than the world (21:13). Creation will be destroyed (21:4, 83), being subject to corruption (21:9; 28:5; 40:3; 42:2; 44:9; 74:2; 83:9-11; 85:5). The world is only temporary (85:10), but will be renewed (32:6; 44:12; 57:2). At the time of the judgment God will vindicate himself (5:2; 48:27; 85:9). Before that time (83:2-7), however, the number to be borne must be completed (23:4f.), because everything has its own time (22:1-8). The destruction of Jerusalem is only one of the things that will happen at the end (20:2); horror will cover the whole earth (25:3; 32:1; 48:30f.). Then one will know that the end is near (23:7; 82:2; 83:1). God will not tarry (20:15; 54:1; 83:1). On the day of judgment the books will be opened (24:1). Until that day the righteous will sleep in the earth, the realm of death and the treasure of souls (11:4; 21:23-24; 31:1-2). These righteous possess a treasure of good works (14:12; 24:1). They will rise from the dust (21:23; 31:1-2), no longer corruptible (40:3; 85:5). Their outward appearance will be changed (50-51), and they will receive the world that was promised to them (14:13; 44:13; 84:6). They will be like angels (51:10), but even more excellent than the angels (51:12). Sinners will waste away in the fire (30:4-5; 44:15; 51:6; 54:14, 21-22). The author's clear theological concepts were shaped by reinterpreting traditions passed down to him. He rejected the idea of a messianic kingdom on earth. He awaits God's judgment; only the Law, which is known to Israel alone, is efficacious. The author tried to show the individual Jews living all over the world that at present nothing is left apart from God and his Law (80:3). Relation to canonical books The number of quotations from the Old Testament is small. In 4:2 Isaiah 49:16 is quoted according to the text of the Peshitta. There might also be quotations in 5:1 (Josh 7:9), 13:2 (Ezek 2:1), and 64:3 (2Chr 33:7), but it is not certain that the author really quoted since he is deeply steeped in the usage of the Old Testament and its contents. He continually uses Old Testament expressions and easily shifts from alluding to them to quoting them. It is, therefore, to be expected that the author often refers to the books of Kings and Chronicles and alludes to the prophet Jeremiah in the final letter to Baruch. It is striking that there are many parallels to the New Testament. It is, of course, impossible to prove dependency on the part of the author. He most likely shared with the New Testament authors a dependency on apocalyptic imagery. The parallels are especially striking with the Pauline Epistles, in particular Romans and 1 and 2 Corinthians. Relation to apocryphal books The work shows a great number of parallels with 4 Ezra and Pseudo-Philo. The parallels"},{"pageNumber":673,"pageContent":"with Pseudo-Philo are too incidental to suppose dependency, and are explicable from a common knowledge of haggadic material. The parallels with 4 Ezra are attributed by many scholars to a dependence by 2 Baruch on 4 Ezra; but singe the theological ideas of the two writings differ widely, a common source is also more likely here. This source might be written, but it is also possible that we are dealing with common knowledge and teaching popular in the synagogues. Some parallels with 4 Baruch apparently are due to dependence by the author of 4 Baruch on 2 Baruch. There are, in addition, a number of parallels with 1 and 2 Enoch, but only in isolated passages. Cultural importance 2 Baruch is extremely important for an understanding of early Judaism since it copes with the catastrophe of A.D. 70. After the destruction of the Temple, a new period arrived that was characterized by the influence of the rabbis. The author opened a way for studying the Law after a period of apocalyptic expectations. He was an expert on both apocalyptic imagery and rabbinic teaching, and, as such, was one of the Jews who managed to bring Judaism into a new era. SELECT BIBLIOGRAPHY Charlesworth, PMR, pp. 83-86.

In this pseudepigraphon, Baruch, the scribe of Jeremiah, weeps over the destruction of Jerusalem and its Temple and the mockery of its heathen destroyers. The Lord sends an angel to comfort him and to guide him through the heavens and show him their mysteries. This angel then leads Baruch through five heavens: 1. The first contains a plain where those being punished for waging war against God are found (ch. 2). 2. The second contains a plain where those who forced others to build a tower to heaven in order to discover its contents are found (ch. 3). 3. The third contains a plain in which are a snake, a sea, and primal rivers, as well as the garden of Eden (perhaps Hades), the sun with the Phoenix, and the moon (chs. 4-9). 4. The fourth contains a plain on which are a pool and exotic birds, and the gathering place of the souls of the righteous (ch. 10). 5. The fifth is where the angels responsible for men on earth bring the gifts of men to Michael, who presents them to God. Baruch does not pass inside the gates of this heaven; they remain closed. In these chapters, three classes of mankind are mentioned: the righteous, the insufficiently righteous, and the sinners. In the Slavonic version, Baruch is granted permission to intercede for the suffering sinners (chs. 11-16). After his heavenly journey, Baruch is returned to earth to relate what he has seen to his fellow men (ch. 17). Texts 3 Baruch is found in both Greek and Slavonic. The Slavonic is a translation from a lost Greek original. GREEK MANUSCRIPTS 1. BM MS Add. 10073. This manuscript is dated from the late fifteenth to the early sixteenth century. It is described by M.

In most respects the more original readings have been preserved in family A. Clear revisions can be found in family B as a whole, and further redaction has led to its subfamilies. Until now, subfamily B1 has been used for comparison with the Greek manuscript tradition, with the exception of a comment by W. Ludtke.3 The translation below is based on family A wherever possible. Unfortunately, its best representatives, manuscripts L and T, both lack the sections 1:2-2:2 and 16:8-17:1, and these have been supplied by family B. Family A: L. Leningrad Greek 70 fols. 105—111 v and St. Catherine's Monastery Slavonic 34 fols. 27-29v. One large manuscript, formerly in St. Catherine's Monastery, Sinai, has been split into four parts. One part (Slavonic 34) remains there, and the other three were removed to Russia and are now in the Salykov-S£edrin State Library of Leningrad. The folios containing 3 Baruch were misbound into two of the parts of this manuscript. B. M. Zagrebin has recently discovered the relationship of these parts and described the contents of the original manu­script.4 The manuscript was written by several scribes; the portion containing 3 Baruch dates from the thirteenth century. This scribe copied a number of apocrypha. A tentative list includes the Abgar Legend, 3 Baruch, and 4 Baruch. The proper sequence of folios in 3 Baruch as now recovered is Greek 70 fols. 105-108; Slavonic 34 fols. 27-29; Greek 70 fols. 109-111 v. Three gaps still damage the text of this manuscript. l:2-2:2a is missing (fols. 105v and 106r [first half] are blank). The order of 2:7-4:5a and 4:5b-5:2a is reversed because of a confusion in an antecedent manuscript, and this is probably what caused the loss of text at 5:2b-12a. The third missing portion is from 16:8 to the end. Both L and T contain an addition before 5:1, and end with an expanded version of the prayer of Baruch in chapter 16. The ending (16:8 to the end) is contained only in the manuscripts of family B. For further details on this manuscript and a diplomatic edition of it, see my forthcoming edition. T. Theological Academy of Moscow No. 363/679, reportedly now in the Historical Museum of Moscow. This manuscript from the fifteenth century was published by N. Tichonravov (see bibliography). In addition to the faults it has in common with L, this manuscript shares with manuscript B the loss of 1:1-3:1, and an addition at the end of 5:3. (This seems to be a fragment from Vita 13-17, otherwise unknown in Slavonic.) Both T and B omit 3:8b. T omits 6:6-10:5. B. Originally in the Barsov collection, this manuscript has passed into the Theological Academy of Kiev. It was written in A.D. 1701 and was published by M. Sokolov (see bibliography). Its language is very late, and it summarizes and rephrases passages freely. Manuscript B ends with a summary conclusion after chapter 9. Family B: The effects of the redaction behind this group can be clearly seen at a number of points: 1. 2:6 is omitted. 2. An interpolation occurs at 3:5. 3 W.

A full description of the manuscripts in family B can be found in Gay lord (see n. 3). THE TEXTUAL BASIS FOR THE TRANSLATIONS The translation below of the Greek is based on the texts of M. R. James and J.-C. Picard. The translation of the Slavonic is based on my forthcoming edition. In that edition manuscript L has been used as the base text, emended when necessary on the basis of a thorough comparison of all the known manuscripts, as described above. When manuscripts L and T are absent (1:2-2:2 and 16:8 to the end), an eclectic text has been made. T and family B are used for 5:2b-12a. News of the discovery of the Sinai manuscript portion of L reached me only after this work was completed. I have had time only to make a preliminary examination of it and a provisional translation. My definitive analysis and translation, especially of 6:6-11:3, will be found in my critical edition. Parallel translations of the Greek and Slavonic texts are presented rather than an eclectic one for several reasons. Firstly, the divergences between the two textual traditions are so many and so great that the apparatus would rapidly be filled with variants alone. Secondly, the systematic variations and tendencies of each tradition should be examined not only on individual readings, but as a whole. Furthermore, the divergence of the textual tradition of present Greek manuscripts and the Greek basis of the present Slavonic tradition occurred not later than the tenth century, approximately five hundred years before the earliest extant Greek manuscript. In several important differences, which separate the Greek from the Slavonic traditions, a strong argument for the priority of the Slavonic exists: 1. The possible dependencies of the Greek on 4 Baruch in the introduction and chapter 1 are omitted in the Slavonic. 2. Explicit New Testament citations in the Greek (4:15; 5:3(?); 15:4; 16:2), and the phrase ''through Jesus Christ Emmanuel\" at 4:15 are all lacking in the Slavonic. 3. The story of the planting of the garden by angels in the Slavonic, lacking in the Greek, is worthy of consideration as original. 4. The structure and content of chapter 4. These matters are discussed below. Original language The Slavonic,version is a translation from Greek. A few linguistic features of the Greek could be explained by supposing a Semitic base text but are not unknown in later Koine Greek usage. There is no convincing argument that the Greek is a translation from another language. Date and provenance The dating and assignment of a historical context for 3 Baruch have been the subject of considerable discussion. M. R. James5 was the first to suggest a reference to this work in Origen, De principiis 2.3.6: \"Finally they appeal to the book of the prophet Baruch to bear witness to this assertion, because in it there are very clear indications of the seven worlds or heavens.\"6 If this identification is correct then the latest possible date for the writing of 3 Baruch would be A.D. 231. The suggestion that the earliest possible date may be set by 4 Baruch because of allusions to it in 3 Baruch (introduction and chapter 1) has been cautioned against by James himself.7 James concluded that 3 Baruch is \"a Christian Apocalypse of 5 James, Apocrypha Anecdota II, p. li. 6 Translation by G. W. Butterworth, Origen on First Principles (London, 1936; repr. New York, 1966) p. 91. 7 James, Apocrypha Anecdota II, p. Iv."},{"pageNumber":709,"pageContent":"the second century. \"8 L. Ginsberg argued that it is a Jewish-gnostic work from the beginning of the second century.9 H. M. Hughes maintained that the original version is a second-century Jewish work that has been modified by Christian redactors.10 J.-C. Picard claimed that it is a product of Jewish mysticism in the Diaspora from the first or second century with very minor Christian interpolations.11 The most recent statement concerning the provenance is that it is a product of Syrian Jewry.12 Origen's statement does not help us to determine the latest possible date for our present work. Either he knew a version other than the present one (i.e. one with seven heavens), or he is speaking about another work altogether that has not survived. The only clear references to 3 Baruch are of a much later date, namely the use of 3 Baruch, chapter 2, in the History of the Rechabites13 and in later Slavonic literature.14 Nor is the suggested earliest possible date reliable since the possible references to 4 Baruch (absent in the Slavonic version) are probably secondary.15 Another argument for the earliest possible date is the dependency of 3 Baruch on 2 Baruch 76:3, in which Baruch is promised a vision.16 However, the interests of the author of 3 Baruch suggest that he belongs to a group completely other than that of the author of 2 Baruch. There is no apocalyptic notion of an end-time in 3 Baruch, nor would that interest him. Furthermore, his interest would seem to be focused on heavenly realities and not on those on earth. A timeless heavenly service in which the good deeds or prayers of men are offered by Michael on the altar is his chief answer to the crisis caused by the destruction of the earthly temple, and not a patient waiting for the new temple (whether in heaven or in Jerusalem) at the end of days. Chapters 11-16 have often been singled out as having Christian characteristics, and even as being a secondary Christian conclusion replacing the earlier Jewish one. Yet many of these Christian elements are lacking in the Slavonic version, e.g. the citation of Matthew 25:23 in 15:4, Romans 10:19 or Deuteronomy 32:21 in 16:2, the monastic expression pneumatikous pateras in 13:4 (although it does contain references to the Church here and in chs. 15 and 16). The Slavonic also lacks the reference to Christian priests, Greek version 16:4. The Greek version would also appear to show a Christianizing tendency at the end of 5:3 (cf. Slavonic 5:3; the phrase as in the Slavonic also appears in 1:6 and 2:6), cf. also 4:15 in the Greek. One definitely sees Christian editing in chapters 11-16 in the Slavonic and even more in the Greek. Christian revision of the Greek manuscript tradition may also be seen in 4:3-6 and 4:15. One cannot be certain about a time and place of composition for 3 Baruch. The alternatives are that it is a Christian composition that has made use of Jewish traditions, which may or may not have been later reworked, or that it is a basically Jewish composition that has undergone Christian reworking. The most likely dating of the initial composition in the latter case would be during the first two centuries after Christ; in the former, the dating would be very difficult. However, the scholarly dichotomy of Jewish and Christian writings in the first two centuries, like the earlier one between Diaspora and Palestinian Jewry, may be a misleading attempt to distinguish what is closely interrelated.

Previously it has been argued that the Slavonic is a rewritten version of the Greek. With the new manuscript evidence it can be seen that the Slavonic represents in the main the same text as the Greek. At some points it is shorter and at others it is longer. Three sections (chs. 4f., 10, and 11-16) are most important in judging the two versions. The Slavonic places the resting place of the righteous and hell apparently elsewhere than in the first four heavens. The Greek version places hell in the third heaven (cf. chs. 4f.), and the resting place of the righteous in the fourth (ch. 10). In chapters 4 and 5 the Slavonic concentrates upon the incidents associated with the Fall: the garden of Eden and the serpent being punished for his role in the Fall. Further, in chapter 10 the inhabitants of the fourth heaven are not the righteous but probably angels singing the praises of God. Yet in both places it can be argued that those passages occurring only in the Greek are a reworking of the original construction, which is better represented by the Slavonic version. In his introduction to the Greek text, M. R. James raised the issue of the relation between 3 Baruch and the fourth-century Apocalypse of Paul and suggested the possibility that the Apocalypse of Paul in chapters 9-18 was dependent on a version of 3 Baruch, chapters 11-16, closer to the original than the present Greek version.17 The Slavonic version of these chapters would reflect such a text, which includes the same sequence at that point as the Apocalypse of Paul. Another possibility would be the dependence of both 3 Baruch and the Apocalypse of Paul on a common original. If the contents of the concluding chapters of the Slavonic version are more original than the Greek, then the earlier chapters 4 and 5 and chapter 10 also must be considered more original. Furthermore it is precisely in chapters 4f. and 11-16 that the Greek has suffered the most at the hands of Christian scribes. Wine is identified as the \"blood of God\" (4:15); \"spiritual fathers\" (mentioned in 13:4) is a Christian term especially used for monastics and bishops, and the function of the priests in 16:4 would also suggest a Christian context. Moreover, the New Testament is explicitly cited in the Greek at 15:4 and perhaps at 16:2. Yet the Slavonic itself is not free from Christian elements (cf. 13:4 and 16:2). While there is evidence of Christian reworking of this apocalypse, there is also strong evidence of its original writing being Jewish or early Christian. The many parallels with Jewish traditions are not likely to have been known after the clear separation between Jewish and Christian communities. Therefore the original work should probably be dated in the first two centuries A.D. Theological importance The visions found in 3 Baruch share elements with many Jewish and Graeco-Roman traditions, yet differ from their parallels at crucial points. The supreme episode in most heavenly visits in the apocryphal and mystical (Merkabah) literature is the appearance before the throne of God. Although the throne is mentioned twice in 3 Baruch (6:8[S]; 9:4[S]), this element is missing in the journey. The gates of the fifth heaven remain closed to Baruch, and he does not see the throne. It is possible, however, that the original text contained descriptions of further heavens, but the original form cannot be reconstructed from the extant versions. There seem to be two differing views concerning God in this work. He acts directly against the two sets of tower builders (2:7; 3:6, 8), but in the later chapters he intervenes only through intermediaries, meting out rewards and punishments (chs. 11-16). Angels implement the will of God in the creation of the garden of Eden and in the daily care of the sun and moon. Moreover, another group of angels render daily (?) account of the activities of men to their commander-in-chief Michael. He receives from them the good works of men, which he as high priest then takes to the temple in an upper heaven to offer upon the altar. The same angels then give rewards and punishments to the men in their charge. This work has a wealth of angels. Two angelic messengers are mentioned: Phanael is described as an archangel (10:1[G]), an angel of hosts (2:6[G]; 10:1[S]), and an interpreter of revelations (11:7[G]). An otherwise unknown angel, Sarasael, delivers a revelation to Noah (4:15). The central angelic figure in 3 Baruch is Michael, who is addressed as the 17 A close relation between ApPaul and 3Bar was first suggested by N. Bonwetsch. Nachrichten. pp. 92f.

An edition of the Slavonic version of ApPaul would aid in sorting out this problem."},{"pageNumber":711,"pageContent":"commander-in-chief of all the angels (see n. to 11:4). Yet his activities are even broader: He holds the keys to the gates of the upper heavens, the kingdom of God or heaven (11:2), and functions as priest in the heavenly temple. In chapters 11-16 he is also the single intermediary between God and the angels overseeing men. Five angels are mentioned by name in the Slavonic version of 3 Baruch: Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, Raphael, and Satanael (the MSS of family A), and Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Phanuel, and Satanael (the MSS of family B). The name Satanael, modeled upon the -EL element in other angels' names, is changed to Satan when he loses his favored status. Satanael is mentioned in several other works as well. The earliest is 2 Enoch 18, 31, where he is the chief of the fallen Watchers. Moreover, he is probably identified with the figure in Isaiah 14:13f. who falls from heaven. A parallel account is also found in the Gospel of Bartholomew 3:25-29 and in the Book of the Cave of Treasures.18 Yet the name Satanael in the Slavonic is probably secondary to the name Samael in the Greek version. Samael became a centralizing figure in the later rabbinic literature, incorporating the functions of several angels. Yet Diabolos, or Satan, functioned in the same manner among Christians, and we find little record of Samael in Christian literature. The first four archangels in the two lists are each paralleled in early Jewish and Christian sources (see n. to 4:7[S]). The name Samael is very common as the chief of evil angels in rabbinic literature and some apocryphal works. Possible etymologies are the poison of God (cf. the poison administered by the Angel of Death, b. AZ 20b), or the blind one. Both versions of 3 Baruch are confused in their treatment of Samael and the vine. In the Greek they are both cursed before the fall of Adam and Eve, but the vine is to be transformed for the good (4:15). In the Slavonic version the vine is first identified with \"sinful desire which Satanael spread over Eve and Adam,\" and then Noah is told to \"alter its name and change it for the better.\" Implied in both versions is disobedience among the angels before that of Adam and Eve. At least three different backgrounds are possible for the account of Samael here, and it is impossible to make a definitive judgment. Though the vine was planted by Samael and cursed by God, in the new creation after the Flood the vine and its fruit remain useful, within reason. By his disobedience Adam lost \"the glory of God\" (4:16[GJ), which may have been comparable to that of angels (cf. 13:4[S]). The reward of the righteous is oil, possibly the sign of the glory of God, which the angel-guide promises to show Baruch several times in this text (6:12; 7:2; 11:2; 16:3[S]). It is hardly accidental that there are traditions that Adam sought to receive the \"oil of mercy\" at the point of death, and that Enoch was transformed by the \"oil of his glory\" (see n. to 15:1). The angel describes the resting place of the righteous as one of glory (16:4[S]), but Baruch does not visit it. The story about the phoenix bird, known in classical, Jewish, and Christian antiquity, also appears here.19 Many of the details correspond to the classical tradition. Early Christianity used this story as a symbolic representation of the resurrection of Jesus: the new phoenix rising out of the ashes of its predecessor. Yet here, without parallel, the phoenix is the protector of the world, shielding its inhabitants from the fierce pure rays of the sun, which would destroy them and their impure deeds were it not for this mediator. Two central themes run through the entirety of 3 Baruch. At the opening, Baruch is crying over the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple. The angel tells him not to be concerned for the salvation of Jerusalem (1:3), and he promises to show Baruch the mysteries of God. These mysteries concern obedience and disobedience to God's commands and their results. Another aspect of the mysteries that Baruch encounters at many points is the wonders of the natural, albeit heavenly world. He observes the workings of the sun and moon and, most clearly in the Slavonic, observes other wonders too: the snake that keeps the great sea in balance and the origin of fruitful rains. Baruch sees the punishment of those who waged war with God (ch. 2), of those who forced others to build a tower to the heavens (ch. 3), of the serpent who participated in the temptation of Adam and Eve (ch. 4), of the moon that helped Samael in the temptation (ch. 9), and the punishment of men who disobey God's commands 18 See E. A. W. Budge, The Book of the Cave of the Treasures (London, 1927) pp. 56f. 19 [See the recent and very important work on the phoenix—and the discussion of the phoenix in 3Bar (especially pp. 261-304)—by R. van den Broek. The Mxth of the Phoenix (Leiden, 1972); also cf. nn. d, e. h. j. and k to ch. 6 below. —J.H.C.I"},{"pageNumber":712,"pageContent":"(ch. 16). Moreover, Adam himself lost the \"glory of God\" because of his disobedience (4:13, 16). In chapters 11-16 the focus is shifted to those presently living. No final Day of Judgment is even hinted at (except in Baruch's remark in 1:7). It appears that angels take a daily account of the lives of men and receive new instructions concerning them. Those who have lived virtuously receive their reward, and those who have clearly been disobedient are punished for committing the sins listed at several points in the text (chs. 4, 8, 13). The two versions give differing accounts of those who have insufficient accomplishments. Baruch's initial concern would seem to be about the proper functioning of the Temple in Jerusalem. How can the proper relation between God and men be maintained without the sacrifices of the Temple? The answer becomes clear: There is a heavenly temple in which the prayers, virtues, and good deeds are offered by Michael. The rewards, the oil (of mercy) and the glory of God, will not be withheld because of the absence of the Temple in Jerusalem. This answer is quite different from others given in this period. Here there is no mention of a messiah, no division between Israel and the other nations (except possibly in Baruch's opening lament), and no notion of two ages. Relation to canonical books The opening chapters of 3 Baruch are most closely bound to stories from the Book of Genesis, but these are expanded and reworked in a manner common to much of the literature of second Temple Judaism. A good example of this is the treatment of the tower of Babel (Gen 11:1-9). Two different groups of men seem to be distinguished here.20 The first group attempted to reach heaven in order to wage war with God and are punished in the first heaven. The second group, imprisoned in the second heaven, forced others to build a tower so as to discover the composition of heaven. Here several elements of the Egyptian enslavement of Israel are incorporated into the story. The store cities (fortified cities in LXX) of Exodus 1:11 may here have been interpreted as a tower. The story of the woman forced to work while giving birth is elsewhere told of the Egyptian period (see n. to 3:5). Bricks are also a strong element of the account in Exodus 1. The punishment with blindness is mentioned in Genesis 19:11 in relation to the citizens of Sodom and Gomorrah, but it is suggested already in the Wisdom of Solomon 19:17 that the plague of darkness (Ex 10:21-23) was also blindness. Again, the story of the garden of Eden is expanded here. The planting of the garden was not done directly by God but by his angels, and the angel who caused Adam and Eve to sin was one of these angels. The punishment of the snake (Gen 3:14f.) takes place in the third heaven, where, according to the Slavonic version, he \"eats earth like grass\" (4:3). The giants who, we are told, were drowned in the Flood may be the children of the unions described in Genesis 6:1-4 (cf. e.g. IEn 6-16). A strong typological relation is set up between Adam and Noah, who discovers a piece of the vine through which Adam and Eve sinned washed out of the garden by the receding floodwaters. Afraid to provoke God's wrath, Noah hesitates to plant the vine, but the angel Sarasael is sent to instruct him to do so.21 Relation to apocryphal books Baruch, a minor figure in the Book of Jeremiah, became an important pseudonym in the second Temple period of Jewish history. In the second century B.C., 1 Baruch 1:1-3:8 was written. After A.D. 70 the works 2 and 4 Baruch were written. These books attributed to Baruch are not the work of a single school, but this name brought associations of the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of the Temple in 587 B.C. and the crisis that resulted. Furthermore, there is a Christian Apocalypse of Baruch in Ethiopic which was adapted by 20 A threefold division of tower builders is mentioned in rabbinic sources: \"Rabbi Jeremiah ben Eleazer said. They (the builders) were split into three groups.' One said, 'Let us go up and dwell there,' and one said, 'Let us go up and practise idolatry,' and one said, 'Let us go up and make war.' \" The first group is dispersed, the second is stopped when God confuses their tongues, and the third group is changed into apes, evil spirits, and demons (b.Sanh 109a). 21 The two versions diverge greatly here (5:15). The Gk. \"and its fruit. . .\" is a Christian addition, but its opening and closing phrases may be original."},{"pageNumber":713,"pageContent":"the Falashas.22 Justin the Gnostic in the second century also had a book of Baruch.23 James thinks that still another book of Baruch was known to Cyprian.24 One can see by the last three books the degree to which Baruch's name was used for very different purposes: He is even identified as an angel by Justin the Gnostic. 3 Baruch is one of a number of books concerning the visions of a man conducted through the various heavens. Similar visions are recorded in the Testament of Abraham, the Apoc­alypse of Abraham, 1 Enoch, 2 Enoch, the Testament of Levi, the Vision of Isaiah, and the Merkabah literature. Lists of seven heavens and their contents are also given in rabbinic sources. These lists are far from uniform, and different items occur in the various works. On many specific points common traditions are shared between 3 Baruch and other apocryphal literature, and these are mentioned in the notes below. Among these is the tradition about Adam's pre-Fall glory, which he lost (4:16[G]). This important tradition is closely related to the books concerning Adam and Eve. The secondary references to Satanael in the Slavonic version have probably been influenced by Christian traditions; this may also be true of the mention of Satanael in 2 Enoch. Still, it is possible that this myth, based on Isaiah 14:12-14, and found in the Latin Vita Adae et Evae as well as in one late rabbinic source, is much older than is sometimes thought. In what A. Vaillant considers the oldest version of 2 Enoch25 seven phoenixes are located in the sixth heaven (2En 19:6). However, in the long text, phoenixes and chalkydii accompany the sun in the fourth heaven (2En 12:1-3). Moreover, they announce to the earthly birds the entrance of the sun at dawn (2En 15:1). Yet the main function of the phoenix in 3 Baruch, guardian of the world, has no parallel. Cultural importance This work has not made a great impact in later history. It is possible that it has influenced certain parts of the Apocalypse of Paul and the History of the Rechabites. Origen may cite it at one point. Yet in Slavic literature it has had some importance, as witnessed by the fact that twelve known manuscripts exist today. The Slavonic version was reedited before the fourteenth century (MSS of family B). Moreover, it gave rise to a Bulgarian folktale known from the eighteenth century.26 There are also Russian manuscripts (15th-17th cent.) of a moral discourse against the abuse of wine, which uses chapters 4 and 5 of 3 Baruch to confirm its point.27 Thus while in Western Europe and Greece 3 Baruch has lain in libraries unread until the late nineteenth century, it has been in popular and religious use among Slavic peoples. 22 Cf.

And all were great, excelling those on earth. 4 And I asked the angel, \"What is the plain and what is the lake and what are the multitude of birds around it?\" 5 And the angel said, \"Listen, Baruch: This plain which surrounds the lake, and in which are other mysteries, is the place where the souls of the righteousd come when they assemble, living together choir by choir. 6 And the water is that which the clouds receive to send as rain upon the earth, and (then) fruit grows.\" 10 a.

RUBINKIEWICZ The theme of the Apocalypse of Abraham seems to be Israel's election and its covenant with God. The document can be divided into two parts, chapters 1-8 and chapters 9-32. Chapters 1-8 constitute a story of Abraham's youth and his perception of idolatry. Abraham concludes that his father's idols are not gods, because some stone idols are crushed and a wooden idol is accidentally consumed by fire. Abraham consequently beseeches God to reveal himself, whereupon he hears God's voice, which instructs Abraham to leave his father's house. Abraham is commanded to offer a sacrifice so that God will reveal \"great things which you have not seen ...\" (9:6). God sends his angel Iaoel to lead Abraham up to heaven (15:4), where he sees seven visions: the light and fiery angels (15:5-7), the fire (17:1-3), the throne (18:1-14), the firmaments (19:4-9), the world (21:2-7), the seven sins of the world (24:3-25:2), and the destruction of the Temple (27:1-3). Finally God announces the punishment of the gentiles through ten plagues (chs. 29f.) and the victory of the just (chs. 31f.). Texts The Apocalypse of Abraham is known only in an Old Slavonic translation, which has come down to us in several Russian redactions. The combined witness of six manuscripts that contain essentially the full text allows us to discern fairly clearly the original form of the Slavonic text, although many details remain obscure. Four manuscripts provide confir­matory evidence only for the first eight chapters. Other fragments, summaries, and reworkings are obviously derived from the older long form; they will not concern us here. The apocalypse appears as a completely independent unit only in one manuscript, but basically the same text is found in a second manuscript with a slightly different beginning and a radically truncated ending. A slightly different redaction is reflected in the text that has been incorporated into the Explanatory Palaia (Tolkovaja Paleja), a broad account of Old Testament history interspersed with exegesis, much of it anti-Jewish polemic.

We were able to consult the unpublished texts D, B, and C in microfilms, which were made available through the cooperation of the libraries and museums of the U.S.S.R.1 The Palaia manuscripts, which contain the longer form of the Ladder of Jacob, have the first eight chapters of the Apocalypse of Abraham; this is the later Palaia redaction. The earlier redaction, represented by the Kolomna manuscript of A.D. 1406, has only a few fragments of the Apocalypse of Abraham. An abbreviated text, summarizing chapters 1-12, 15, 17, 20, and 30, is found in two manuscripts, while a derived legend is found in seven. They are not helpful in establishing the early Slavonic text. Most critics have distinguished two parts to the Apocalypse of Abraham: chapters 1-8 and chapters 9-32; they claim that the former did not belong to the original apocalyptic work but was added later by an editor.2 If our interpretation of the apocalypse 1-6 is correct, these chapters form an integral part of the work and were written by the same author who composed the rest of the apocalypse. It is generally accepted that the present text of the apocalypse has many insertions which are due to Slavonic editors. All of chapter 7 seems to be redactional.3 Original language A thorough investigation of the original language of the Apocalypse of Abraham has never been undertaken. A. Rubinstein studied only ten passages from the apocalypse and concluded that the document probably was written in Hebrew.4 The Slavonic text of the Apocalypse of Abraham contains several Hebrew names, words, and phrases. The most impressive examples are the following: Ioavan is a Slavonic deformation of the Hebrew ywn (Greece); Souzouch is probably a transcription of the name kwrws (Cyrus); and Maroumat is an abbreviation of the Hebrew Martd Roma. The use of parts of the body instead of a simple pronoun is frequent: \"My heart was perplexed\" (1:4), \"Why now have you afflicted my heart?\" (27:6).5 The parallelism of the verses reflects Semitic thought.6 The positive instead of a comparative betrays a Semitic original. \"It was heavy of a big stone\" (1:5) renders the Semitic kbd mn (cf. also 6:9), which has to be translated: \"heavier than a big stone.\" Moreover, the prepositions are sometimes utilized according to Hebrew rather than Slavonic syntax (for example: 8:4, \"for the sins,\" lit. \"in the sins\"; 12:10, \"you will see all,\" lit. \"you will see in all\" [= Heb. t°h fr7]7; 27:11, \"to rule from them in them,\" lit. \"to rule in them\" [= Heb. hmsylty bhm]). The syntax of the temporal phrases reflects the Hebrew original of our apocalypse. Frequently a phrase is introduced by the verb hyh: \"And it came to pass, that when I saw it, my heart was perplexed ...\" (1:4; cf. e.g. 1:7; 2:5; 5:4; 5:10, 11; 8:5). Numerous other examples could be cited. The foregoing suggests that the Apocalypse of Abraham was written in a Semitic language, probably in Hebrew. The Slavonic version of the Apocalypse of Abraham was made in the eleventh or twelfth 1 A seventh text (Uvarov 85, fols. 297-313, Historical Museum, Moscow) turned out to be a copy of S and therefore of no interest. E. Turdeanu, in his preliminary study of the MSS on the basis of published materials (\"L'Apocalypse d'Abraham en slave,\" JSJ 3 [1972] 156-64), did not know of MSS C and D, which we found during our work toward a critical edition of the ApAb. He believed that MS Sin. 548 (Historical Museum, Moscow) contained ApAb; N. B. Tikhomirov of the Lenin Library has kindly informed us that this is an error. I am grateful to the editor for polishing the introduction and to H. G. Lunt for improving the English translation. 2 Cf. N. Bonwetsch, Die Apokalypse Abrahams: Das Testament der vierzig Mdrtyrer, p. 41. 3 Ch. 7 seems to be derived from Palaea Tolkovaja (Moscow, 1892) pp. 123-45. 4 Cf. A.

It may be that this pseudepigraphon was translated directly from Hebrew into Slavonic. Between 1108/9 and 1120 the archbishop of Ochride (Macedonia) was Leon Mung, a Jew converted to Christi­anity.8 His teacher was Tobias b. Eleazar (11th cent.), the author of the Midrash Lekah Tov. Bulgaria at that time had educated men who could make the translation from Hebrew into Slavonic. Further study needs to be made regarding this issue. Date It is commonly held that our pseudepigraphon was composed at the end of the first century A.D. No decisive argument, however, has been given in support of this date. In the following paragraphs the issue will be discussed first in terms of the external and then in terms of the internal data. The testimonies of Nicephorus,9 patriarch of Constantinople (806-15), of Pseudo-Atha-nasius (6th cent.),10 and of the Apostolic Constitutions (4/5th cent.)11 are very vague and nothing can be deduced from them in regard to our apocalypse. Epiphanius (4th cent.) speaks about some \"Apocalypse of Abraham\" used by the Sethians.12 The same apocalypse was utilized by the Audiens and we know its content, thanks to Theodore bar Konai (8th cent.)13 and Origen.14 There can be no doubt, however, that the writing used by the Sethians and our pseudepigraphon are two different works. The text of Recognitiones (2nd cent.) gives us at least two traditions. The first one presents Abraham as an astrologer (Rec. 32:3f.), the second one (33:lf.) may be an allusion to the Apocalypse of Abraham. These witnesses permit us to suggest that the Apocalypse of Abraham was possibly known by the second century. Our pseudepigraphon was written after A.D. 70, because the author describes the destruction of Jerusalem (cf. ch. 27). Hence, the apocalypse—that is the early Jewish stratum—was composed sometime after A.D. 70 and before the middle of the second century.15 It is unwise to speculate further regarding the date of the apocalypse in the present collection of documents.16 Provenance17 If the original language of the Apocalypse of Abraham is Hebrew, then it was most likely composed in Palestine. It is necessary to be conservative regarding the probable provenance of the apocalypse for two main reasons: First, it is preserved in Slavonic manuscripts that are far removed from the conjectured time and place of the original composition. Second, as stated herein by H. G. Lunt and F. I. Andersen respectively in the presentations of the Ladder of Jacob and 2 Enoch, pseudepigrapha preserved only in Slavonic may have been considerably altered by the Bogomils (a medieval dualist sect), who were influenced by passages in the pseudepigrapha and composed new ones. 8 Cf. \"Notitia Archiepiscopi Iannis Comneni,\" ed. in: Fontes Historiae Bulgaricae (Sofia, 1968) vol. 7, p. 110; see also: N.

The interpolator of 29:3-13 was probably a Christian editor who had nothing to do with gnostic circles. However, the gloss in 22:5, the censure in 20:5, and the gloss in 20:7 reveal that their author wanted to indicate that the God of Abraham is a god of evil. This point of view is usually associated with the gnostics. The gloss in 22:5 and the censured text of 20:5, however, show that they could be made only in the Slavic world. The only Slavs who claimed that the God of the Old Testament was the god of evil were the Bogomils. Their founder was Pope Bogomil (10th cent. A.D.). According to the Bogomils, God had two sons: Satanael and Jesus. Satanael rebelled against God and created the visible world; everything described in the book of Genesis is the work of the devil. If then this world is created by Satanael (= god of the OT), one has to abstain from every contact with the material world. The Bogomils, therefore, condemned marriage, abstained from meat and wine, and did not believe in the resurrection of the body.18 The glosses in 20:5, 7 and 22:5 perfectly suit their doctrine. We can say the same about the interpolator of 29:3-13; he shows that Jesus came forth from the heathens and not from the Jews (= the people with Azazel!). Perhaps also inserted by a Bogomil were 9:7, an injunction against meat and wine, and 23:4-10, which claims that the sin of Adam and Eve consisted in the conjugal relation. Maybe the same Bogomil editor interpolated 10:6-12 and 17:8b—19. The general content of the account of the sin of Adam and Eve reveals that it comes from Jewish sources. It fit the Bogomil doctrine, however, and therefore was inserted into our apocalypse. Theological importance God. The God of eternity (9:3) is the God who protects Abraham and his descendants (9:4). He created the world (9:4), chose Israel, called this nation \"my people\" (22:5; 31:1), and will give it victory over its enemies (31:If.). Angelology. Angelology plays a large role in our apocalypse. The most important figure is the Angel of God, Iaoel. His fundamental role is to protect and strengthen Abraham (10:3). Demonology. The chief of the fallen angels is Azazel (13:6). His power is over the earth, because he has chosen it for his dwelling place (13:7f.; 14:6). However, his power is limited (13:10) since God does not permit him to tempt all the righteous (13:11). For example, he cannot seduce Abraham (13:14), and he has no power over the body of the righteous (13:10). Cosmology. God shows Abraham the firmaments in order that he may know that \"on no single expanse is there any other but the one whom\" Abraham has searched for or who has loved him (19:3). God says to Abraham: \"Look now beneath your feet at the firmament and understand the creation that was depicted of old on this expanse\" (21:1). Abraham sees then the earth with the wicked men, and the garden of Eden with the just, he sees the sea with Leviathan, and the waters over the firmaments; at last, he watches the men on the right and on the left side of the \"picture of creation\" (chs. 2 If.). Abraham is told that as the world is divided into two parts: earth and Eden, the waters of the sea and the waters over the firmaments, so mankind is divided into the people of God and the heathens (21:3-7). The numeration of the firmaments is due to editorial expansions, probably by a Slavic editor. The descriptions of the three heavens is similar to that in the Testament of Levi 3:1-4. Dualism. In the Apocalypse of Abraham there is no ontological dualism. The created world is good before the eyes of God (22:2). There is no other God in the universe than \"the one whom\" Abraham has \"searched for\" and \"who has loved\" him (19:3). There is evil in the world, but it is not inevitable. God has full control over the world and he does not permit the body of the just to remain in the hand of Azazel (13:10). Azazel is wrong if he thinks he can scorn justice and disperse the secret of heaven (14:4). He will be banished in the desert forever (14:5). Eschatology. The age of ungodliness endures \"twelve periods\" (29:2). After the last '* Cf. D. Obolenski. The Bogomils (Cambridge, 1948); S. Runciman, The Medieval Manichees (Cambridge, 1947); D. Angelov, Bogomilstvo vU Bulgarija (Sofia, 1961)."},{"pageNumber":738,"pageContent":"period comes the final judgment, which precedes the redemption of the just. God announces ten plagues (29:15; 30:2-8); when they pass, he will send his \"chosen one\" (31:1) who will gather the dispersed people. Together with him God will punish the heathens (31:2). The apostates will be burned through the fire of Azazel (31:6); the Temple and the sacrifices will be restored (29:17f.). The doctrine of resurrection is noticeably absent, although it may be reflected in the symbol of the dew (19:4). The Apocalypse of Abraham, however, passed through the hands of the Bogomils, who did not believe in the resurrection of the body. It is possible that phrases mentioning the resurrection were omitted. It is clear, regardless of that possibility, that our author believed in life after death (cf. 21:6). Relation to the canonical books19 The books of Genesis and Ezekiel play a fundamental role in the Apocalypse of Abraham. The author begins with the text of Genesis 20:13 (ApAb 1:1), which is quoted according to the exegesis of the Targums; he ends his work with the citation of Genesis 15:13-16 (= ApAb 32:1-3), but he changes the biblical \"fourth generation\" into \"seventh,\" i.e. a perfect one. The apocalypse at 8:4 and 9:1-4 reflects respectively Genesis 12:1 and 15:1 seen in the light of Psalm 20:2f. or Deuteronomy 33:29. The author quotes Genesis 15:9f. (ApAb 9:5), and Genesis 15:17a (ApAb 15:1). Apocalypse of Abraham 20:4 calls to mind Genesis 18:27; 20:6 is based on Genesis 18:30. Chapters 1 and 10 of Ezekiel are behind chapters 18f. Abraham sees four living creatures (ApAb 18:5-11; Ezek 1:10; 10:14), the wheels full of eyes (ApAb 18:3, 12), the throne (ApAb 18:3; Ezek 1:23), and the divine chariot (ApAb 18:12; Ezek 10:6). There is no direct relationship between the Apocalypse of Abraham and the New Testament. There are some parallel expressions, however, which may indicate that both drew from a shared tradition. Relation to the apocryphal books The author of the Apocalypse of Abraham follows the tradition of 1 Enoch 1-36. The chief of the fallen angels is Azazel, who rules the stars and most men. It is not difficult to find here the traditions of Genesis 6:1-4 developed according to the tradition of 1 Enoch. Azazel is the head of the angels who plotted against the Lord and who impregnated the daughters of men.20 These angels are compared to the stars.21 Azazel revealed the secrets of heaven and is banished to the desert.22 Abraham, as Enoch, receives the power to drive away Satan.23 All these connections show that the author of the Apocalypse of Abraham drew upon the tradition of 1 Enoch. Cultural importance The Apocalypse of Abraham is one of the most important works written after the destruction of the nation in A.D. 70. The importance of the apocalypse may be compared to that of 2 Baruch or 4 Ezra, but our author analyzes the causes of the destruction of Jerusalem from a different perspective: The defeat was caused by the infidelity of Israel toward the covenant with God and the opportunistic politics of some leaders. The pseudepigraphon is written with great talent and with a good understanding of biblical exegesis. The symbolical language is clear, logical, and easy to understand. The Apocalypse of Abraham provides us with an insight into the literary \"workshop\" of the Palestinian 19 For a full discussion see Rubinkiewicz, L'Apocalypse a\"Abraham. 20 ApAb 14:4; lEn 6:4 and ApAb 14:6; lEn 6:If.; 10:4. 21 ApAb 14:6; lEn 86:1. 22 ApAb 14:4; lEn 8:1 and ApAb 14:5; lEn 10:4. 23 ApAb 14:3; lEn 14:3."},{"pageNumber":739,"pageContent":"writers of the first century A.D.; in consequence we may understand better the literary genres of that period. The Apocalypse of Abraham was practically unknown for ten centuries. Neither the Semitic original nor the supposed Greek version has been found. Perhaps the latter never existed. Translated into Slavonic, our document circulated first in Bulgaria and afterward in Russia. Known only in the Orient, it had no influence on occidental literature. The transmission of the Apocalypse of Abraham24 The Slavonic Apocalypse of Abraham is to be ascribed to the extraordinarily productive burst of cultural activity during the reign of Simeon of Bulgaria (893-927), when a prodigious amount of material was translated from Greek into Old Church Slavonic as part of the effort of the Bulgarian emperor to bring his realm to the level of Byzantium itself.25 The translation contains Greek words well known from Old Church Slavonic (adu: \"haides, Hades\"; aeru: \"air, air\"; stuxija: \"stoicheion, element\"), along with the conventional bizarre rendering of Gehenna as \"fiery race\" (by a confusion of geenna with gened or some other derivative of the Gk. root gen-) and numerous literalistic phrases that make better sense in Greek than in Slavonic. There can be no question that this text, like the whole Slavonic culture of Bulgaria of the time, was translated from Greek.26 It is, then, fully realistic to assume that a Greek text of the Apocalypse of Abraham still existed in the Balkans as late as the ninth century, although no trace has yet been found in surviving Greek manuscripts. The style is strongly Semitic but generally within the bounds of the biblical Greek that was presumably used by some hellenistic Jews for original works, e.g. Revelation. It is reasonable to hypothesize that the text was composed in Hebrew or Aramaic and rendered very literally into Greek. While no decisive arguments for a Semitic original have yet been advanced, the sheer number of Semitisms is best explained by this hypothesis. The quotation of the Divine Name El, El, El, El (retained only in copy S) and Eli (glossed \"that is, my God\"; replaced, except in copy S, by the spelling ///, in line with the accepted form in Mt 27:46) is suggestive but inconclusive. Final -il for Hebrew 'el in the names Azazel, Iaoel, and Michael indicates Greek mediation. Perhaps the strange wording of 9:4 reflects the Hebrew of Genesis 15:1 (see n. b to ch. 9). It is not impossible that putt zeminu (10:4) reflects drk 'rs in the sense of \"manners, morality,\" but it may be an inept way of expressing \"the road to the (promised) land.\" This meager evidence may suggest a Hebrew original. The Slavonic text has come down to us in relatively full form in six manuscripts, the oldest from the early fourteenth century, the second from the fifteenth, and the others from the sixteenth century. The chief distinction among the copies is that four contain the apocalypse more or less integrated into the Explanatory Palaia, while two present the text as an independent (copy S) or nearly independent unit (copy D). The Palaia variants contain long interpolations of anti-Jewish polemical passages, but otherwise the text is so close to S D that only in chapter 7 is a new redaction indicated. The oldest copy, S, is unfortunately extremely faulty, with numerous omissions of syllables, sentences, and even paragraphs; with frequent distortions even of obvious words; and with unsuccessful efforts to update the archaic language, the forms and vocabulary of which were often not understood by the 24 [Due to the complicated history of transmission of ApAb, the following remarks by H. G. Lunt are intended to supplement the work of R. Rubinkiewicz. —J.H.C.I 25 The translation of ApAb could be slightly earlier, from the last years of the initial period of Slavonic culture, viz., the Moravian mission of Cyril and Methodius (863-84), and its Bulgarian offshoot after 864; for it appears that the translation was made into an occidental version of OCS and then, like most texts that have come down to us through East Slavic mediation, adapted to the more eastern norm that was elaborated under Simeon. It is impossible, however, to exclude a dating up to about 1050, the end of the OCS period. In any case, the archaic language of ApAb makes Turdeanu s ascription of the translation to the 13th cent, unacceptable (cf. E. Turdeanu, JSJ 3 [1972] 156-64). The combined evidence of such works as IEn, the Palaia, and the Visls requires us to posit Slavonic versions of many apocryphal and pseudepigraphic works—along with a remarkable store of more orthodox texts—before the final Byzantine military triumph of 1018 and the rapid withering of Slavonic cultural activity in the Balkans. See H. G. Lunt, \"On the Language of the Slavonic Apocalypse of Abraham,\" Festschrift for Moshi Altbauer (Slavica Hiero-solymitana; in press). 26 A few translations from Lat., made in Moravia (or Pannonia or perhaps Dalmatia). may have been in use in Macedonia and Bulgaria, e.g. the GNic. The products of western Slavonic culture are somewhat better represented in Russia, where they were introduced between about 988 and 1100."},{"pageNumber":740,"pageContent":"scribe.27 Copy D stems ultimately from the same Vorlage as copy S, but unfortunately the scribe, clearly not at home in the style and special sphere of apocalyptic tradition and allusions, gave up well before the end and simply omitted most of the apocalyptic vision (from 26:5 on), reducing all of it to a few phrases. On the other hand, the Palaia texts A B C K continue beyond the end of S (in 31:3).28 Tikhonravov29 apparently chose to exclude a paragraph (ch. 32) that PornYev,30 probably rightly, assigns to this text rather than to the subsequent episode in the Palaia account of Abraham's life. It is reasonable to assume that all six copies stem originally from a single old manuscript (very likely with some faults) representing the archaic language in South Slavic orthography. All copies reflect Novgorod phonetics at some state in their history; this shows up in 6:7 (udinen: \"appointed, installed\") of A B C K instead of S D's correct udenen: \"valued.\" B is, overall, the most reliable text, occasionally agreeing with S D against A C K (e.g. in retaining in 17:2 pokljade, \"knelt,\" a word not known in Russian, against the replacement ponik, 4'having bowed his head,\" of A C K). A and C often go together,31 but they have independent omissions and distortions. K, the youngest copy, shows many clarifying par­aphrases or lexical substitutions that are illuminating even when they only show precisely in what way the scribe understood the old text. B has as marginal notes materials K incorporates into the text. The picure is approximately as follows: *Greel^ text *OCS,translation, c. 900 S (14th cent.)-•copy available in Russia Palaia materials incorporated U (16th cent.) B (16th cent.) D (16th cent.) (j)—A (15th cent.) C (16th cent.) K(16/17thcent.) Agreement of S D B provides the most reliable readings. On the whole, variations are minor and a plausible text can be established, but there are important passages where the textual corruptive cannot be repaired. The German translation by Bonwetsch32 and the English one by Box, assisted by Landsman,33 were based on rather indiscriminate selections of variants from the published texts of S A K. Neither translator was fully acquainted with the medieval language, and both made a number of conjectures and emendations based on modern Russian rather than Old Slavonic. Since these translations have been the basis of much of the work on the apocalypse, we have felt it necessary to point out some of their mistakes in our notes. The aim of the present translation is to give readers the clearest possible picture of the complicated Slavonic text we believe to have been available in Russia in the thirteenth or fourteenth century. The history of that text back to about A.D. 900 and of its Greek model or models of earlier date remains a matter for speculation. It is quite possible that individual component parts have very diverse origins. The translation follows the chapter divisions established by Bonwetsch and, with a few exceptions, the verses used by Rubinkiewicz in his Rome dissertation. The song in chapter 17 is treated as verse, but 21:3-7, which might be viewed as poetry, is set as prose. 27 The scribe mistreats in the same way the other texts in the codex; however, some of these are far less exotic in theme and archaic in language. Thus no editorial purpose is to be discerned for the odd omissions and distortions in S, although of course they must be noted in cases where we must depend on the witness of other MSS. 28 The scribe of S ends another text in mid-sentence. 29 N.

A NEW TRANSLATION AND INTRODUCTION BY G. MACRAE The Apocalypse of Adam is a gnostic secret revelation or \"apocalypse\" communicated by Adam to his son Seth and destined to be preserved for Seth's posterity, the race of the gnostics. Because it is narrated by Adam immediately before his death, it also bears some of the literary characteristics of the genre testament. Adam first narrates the story of the Fall in a peculiarly gnostic version without much direct dependence on the Genesis garden story. In his fallen state of subservience to the creator God, without knowledge of the God of truth above, he receives a revelation of the future from three mysterious strangers, and it is this revelation that forms the substance of the remaining narrative. Adam then foretells the story of the Flood, of the resettlement of the world, and of a cosmic conflagration that is perhaps based on the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. These catastrophic events are interpreted as efforts on the part of the creator God to destroy the race of Seth, of which he is envious, but heavenly beings save them in each case. In a third episode a saving figure, called the \"Illuminator of knowledge,\" comes and is persecuted by the powers of the world, who in their wrath are perplexed about his origin and their own ignorance. There follows a long poetic passage in which erroneous myths about his origin on the part of thirteen \"kingdoms\" are narrated in very stylized form. In contrast with these, the \"kingless race\" (i.e. the Sethian gnostics) know his true origin from above and are enlightened by him. The peoples of the earth then acknowledge their error and the supremacy of the gnostics, and a voice confirms both. In the formal conclusion of the work baptism is equated with gnosis, or knowledge. Text The Apocalypse of Adam is preserved in a unique manuscript in the collection of Coptic codices discovered near Nag Hammadi, Egypt, in 1946. It is the fifth and last treatise in Codex V (64,1-85,32), which also contains three Christian gnostic apocalypses and a speculative non-Christian gnostic tractate.1 The codex may be dated to the second half of the fourth century A.D.; Codex VII of the same collection has been dated after A.D. 348 on the basis of documentary papyri embedded in its cover.2 The codex is now preserved in the Coptic Museum at Old Cairo (inventory number 10548). Almost all of the pages of the Apocalypse of Adam have suffered damage at the bottom and sometimes at the top so that several lines of text are often missing. Original language The extant version of the Apocalypse of Adam is in the Sahidic dialect of Coptic with 1 See the table of contents of the library in A. Bohlig and F. Wisse, Nag Hammadi Codices III, 2 and IV, 2: The Gospel of the Egyptians (NHS 4; Leiden, 1975) pp. xi-xii. 2 J. W. B. Barns, \"Greek and Coptic Papyri from the Covers of the Nag Hammadi Codices,\" in M. Krause, ed.. Essays on the Nag Hammadi Texts (NHS 6; Leiden, 1975) pp. 9-18; see especially p. 12."},{"pageNumber":761,"pageContent":"some other dialectal traits characteristic of the dominant language of the Nag Hammadi library. Like most Coptic literature of the early period, it is undoubtedly a translation from Greek, and there are no linguistic features in the work that would point to any other language underlying the Greek. In the rare cases where the apocalypse seems close to the biblical text, it is clearly the Septuagint version that it depends on. Date The only certain conclusion that may be drawn about the date of composition of the work is that it is older than the extant Coptic version. Because the form of the gnostic myth contained in it shows apparently primitive features, and because the work seems to be independent of Christian influence, some interpreters assign it a conjectural date in the first or early second century A.D.3 One author detects in its description of the destruction by fire an allusion to the Vesuvius eruption in A.D. 79 and would date the work no earlier than the first decade of the second century.4 The allusion is a doubtful one, however. The limits for dating are approximately the first to the fourth centuries A.D., and the document probably belongs earlier rather than later in this period. In addition, it may contain traditional elements that are much earlier. Provenance Some of the Nag Hammadi codices bear indications that they were copied in the vicinity of, and perhaps in close relation to, the monastic communities of Upper Egypt, especially Chenoboskion.5 The site of the find confirms this location. If the Apocalypse of Adam is a late document, it might have originated in Egypt. But there is no positive reason to associate the Greek original with Egypt, and it might have been composed anywhere in the Mediter­ranean world. Epiphanius, writing his descriptive catalog of heresies around A.D. 375, describes a sect called the Archontics, whose teachings resemble the Apocalypse of Adam in several ways.6 He locates this sect in his own time in the province of Palestine and in Armenia. The connection with the Archontics is not a strong one, but an earlier Palestinian origin for the apocalypse is not inherently improbable. Historical importance The Apocalypse of Adam, like the majority of gnostic documents that have come down to us, especially the many retellings and embellishments of the Genesis story, provides few if any clues to its milieu or function. It is generally assumed that such gnostic works were written for the edification of gnostic individuals or communities. It has been suggested that this one served as an elementary introduction to Gnosticism for initiates,7 but it does not bear the marks of clearly propagandistic works such as the Letter of Ptolemy to Flora.8 Its real importance lies in the absence of any unmistakably Christian influences in its depiction of the Illuminator of knowledge, opening up the possibility that the work reflects a transition from some form of apocalyptic Judaism to Gnosticism. Much greater specificity would be merely conjecture at the present stage of investigation into the problem of the origins of Gnosticism. Some scholars regard the work as a product of late Gnosticism, but such a view does not exclude the possibility that elements in it may be very much older.9 If the final pages of the document are an indication, it seems to reflect a polemical context 3 E.g. M. Krause in W. Foerster, ed.. Gnosis: A Selection of Gnostic Texts, vol. 2, p. 15. 4 H. Goedicke, \"An Unexpected Allusion to the Vesuvius Eruption in 79 A.D..\" American Journal of Philology 90(1969) 34CM1. 5 T. Save-Soderbergh, \"Holy Scriptures or Apologetic Documentations?

Since nothing in the text clearly suggests Christian baptism, it is possible that the document reflects an encounter between Jewish practitioners of baptism and sectarian gnostics who diverge from them on this issue in particular. The presence of repetitious and occasionally awkward transitions in the narrative suggests that the Apocalypse of Adam in its present form is the result of a process of growth in which several elements were combined or in which the narrative was expanded in successive stages. Such stages may reflect a progressively explicit gnosticizing of Jewish apocalyptic themes. Theological importance One of the most characteristic features of the Apocalypse of Adam, as of many other gnostic writings that retell the creation story, is the sharp distinction drawn between the creator God and the remote supreme God. The former is at times called \"the ruler of the aeons and the powers,\" at times \"God the Almighty,\" even \"Sakla,\" a derisive name. The creator God, the God of Genesis, becomes a hostile power whose mission is to thwart the attempts of humanity to preserve a knowledge of the supreme God, the \"God of truth\" or \"the eternal God.\" This radical dualism of the deity is a gnostic commonplace; it is uncommon, however, for a gnostic work to use the name \"God\" for both the Demiurge and the supreme Father. Humanity in this conception is the creature of the Demiurge and normally lives in servitude to him and in ignorance of the eternal God, destined for death. But the Apocalypse of Adam also distinguishes two categories of people, the followers of the Demiurge and the descendants of Seth, the gnostics, in whom knowledge of the higher God is preserved and who are destined for imperishability: For the whole creation that came from the dead earth will be subject to the power of death. But those who reflect on the knowledge of the eternal God in their hearts will not perish. The apocalypse does not speculate on the eternal or divine element in this type of man, as many gnostic works do, but it clearly seems to presuppose a qualitative difference. The encounter between the types of humanity that is resolved in the final pages of the work does not appear to hold out hope for the ultimate salvation of the non-gnostics. But beyond the promise of imperishability, the precise nature of salvation is not spelled out. As in most gnostic systems, and indeed in many forms of ancient Judaism and Christianity, the cosmos of the Apocalypse of Adam is subject to the influence of a host of spiritual beings, both gracious and malevolent, variously called aeons, angels, and powers. The terms are not used consistently, but the powers are in general the minions of the creator God who oppress humanity and attempt to persecute the gnostics, while \"the great eternal angels\" or \"the holy angels\" are representatives of the eternal God who share the knowledge of the gnostic race and intervene in the world to save them from harm. Relation to canonical books Many gnostic cosmogonic treatises are closely dependent on the text of Genesis, which they paraphrase or comment on consciously and sometimes with careful attention to the original text.10 The Apocalypse of Adam is unusual in that it is clearly dependent on the Genesis story but never quotes it exactly except for an occasional word or phrase. It has the character of a gnostic Midrash on the text, but a text already mediated by a Jewish exegetical tradition. There are no other exact allusions to Old Testament texts in the document, but there is evidence of an acquaintance with the Old Testament, especially with the figure of the Isaian servant of Yahweh in the depiction of the Illuminator of knowledge. Several New Testament passages may be cited as parallels to statements in the Apocalypse of Adam, but there is no reason to postulate dependence on the New Testament text. 10 E.g. The Nature of the Archons. The Apocryphon of John, etc. See O. Wintermute, \"A Study of Gnostic Exegesis of the Old Testament,\" in The Use of the Old Testament in the New and Other Essays, ed. J. M. Efird (Durham, N.C., 1972) pp. 241-70."},{"pageNumber":763,"pageContent":"Relation to apocryphal books Because the Apocalypse of Adam contains gnostic theology, it stands apart from most of the pseudepigrapha. Nevertheless, it is closely related to the extensive Adam literature and has many parallels to the Life of Adam and Eve in particular.11 An exact identification of the work with any previously known document is not possible, however. Epiphanius mentions \"apocalypses of Adam\" as well as \"books in the name of Seth\" in use among the sectarians whom he calls the \"gnostics,\"12 but nothing more specific is known of them. The Cologne Mani Codex quotes passages from an \"Apocalypse of Adam,\"13 the first of a series of apocalypses in the names of Genesis figures, but the quotations have nothing in common with the Nag Hammadi work. Within gnostic literature itself the work shares many features with the Nag Hammadi Gospel of the Egyptians, an explicitly Christian gnostic treatise in the name of Seth. In addition, the Apocalypse of Adam shares its concern about the meaning of baptism and its various names of angels with gnostic writings, especially the Nag Hammadi tractates Zostrianos and Triple Protennoia, and an untitled work from the Bruce Codex.14 SELECT BIBLIOGRAPHY Charlesworth, PMR, pp. 72-74.

The Fall \"Then God, the ruler of the aeonsc and the powers, separated usd wrathfully. Then we became two aeons, and the glory in our hearts deserted us, me and your APMOS 20:1-2; mother Eve, along with the first knowledge that used to breathe within us. #And 21:6 the glory fled from us, entering into other great [aeons] and another great [race],6 one that did not [come (65) from] the aeon that [we] came from, I and Eve your mother. «But the knowledge entered into the seed of great aeons/• That is why I myself have called you by the name of that man who is the seed of the great race Gen 5:3 or from whom (it comes).8 \"After those days the eternal knowledge of the God of truth withdrew from me and your mother Eve. •Since that time we have learned about dead things, like men. •Then we recognized the God who created us, for we were not strangers to his powers, and we served him in fear and subjection. #And afterward our hearts Deut 6:I3; were darkened.                 Ps 2:11 Adam's vision 2 \"Now I was sleeping in the thought of my heart, and I saw before me three Gen 18:2; mena whose appearance I could not recognize because they were not from the TAb6 powers of the God who created me. They surpassed [those powers in their] glory. The men [spoke], (66) saying to me, 'Rise up, Adam, from the sleep of death,b and hear about the aeon and the seed of that man to whom life has come, the one who came forth from you and from Eve your wife.' 1 a. The seven hundredth year, according to the LXX of Gen 5:4 (MT = 800), is the length of Adam's life after the birth of Seth; cf. Josephus, Ant 1.2.3. Thus the apocalypse is a deathbed \"testament\" of Adam. b. Throughout, the word \"glory\" is a literal translation of the Cop. for Gk. doxa. It may some­times refer to honor or dignity, sometimes to ex­ternal splendor, as often in the LXX. c. The word4 'aeon\" in Gk., a loanword in Cop., is sometimes a temporal, sometimes a spatial con­cept. In addition, in gnostic literature it is also used for personal beings, whether spiritual or material. All these meanings occur in ApAdam, but the word is translated \"aeon\" throughout. d. The primordial state of Adam and Eve, as often in gnostic literature, is seen as that of a single androgynous being. Here the androgyne myth is used to interpret Gen 2:21-23. e. The Gk. word genea, a loanword in Cop., is variously translated here as \"race,\" \"nation,\" or \"generation,\" according to the context. f. The point may be to assert that the external splendor of Adam and Eve reverted to heavenly beings, but their knowledge {gnosis) passed into the posterity of Seth. The words \"glory\" and \"knowledge\" are not in the text at this point but are inferred from the grammatical gender of the verbs. The \"seed\" is the posterity or offspring of Seth; two Gk. words, possibly reflecting different sources, and a Cop. word are all rendered \"seed\" throughout the translation. g. The final phrase is obscure and may be an editorial gloss. Seth, perhaps a heavenly prototype of Seth, is the \"man\" referred to. 2 a. The appearance of three \"men\" is common in the Abraham legends and is frequent in gnostic literature, where it is sometimes interpreted in a trinitarian sense. In TAb 6 (rec. A) the strange appearance of the \"men\" is also emphasized. b. The sleep of Adam and his awakening to a revelation of knowledge, which may be rooted in Gen 2:21, is a widespread gnostic motif."},{"pageNumber":766,"pageContent":"3 \"When I heard these words from those great men who stood before me, we 4 sighed in our hearts, I and Eve. #And the Lord, the God who created us, stood Gen 3:8 5 in our presence and said to us, 'Adam, why were you sighing in your hearts? -00 you not know that I am God who created you, and that I breathed into you a spirit0 isa 45:5ff. of life for a living soul?'

The separate mention of Ham and Japheth a few lines below makes the reconstruction of the name of Shem very likely here. The story in Gen 9:20-27 singles out Ham negatively over against Shem and Japheth; Canaan, Ham's son, is to be a slave to Shem and Japheth and Japheth is to dwell in the tents of Shem. By identifying Shem, ancestor of the Israelites, so closely with Noah and God the Almighty, ApAdam seems to show an anti-Jewish bias that is not uncommon in gnostic sources. c. The number 400,000 may be simply a large round number. The Manichean Homilies 68.18 re­fers to \"400,000 righteous,\" and Josephus (Ant 7.13.1) uses the same number of the tribe of Judah. Here it apparently refers to non-Jewish converts to the race of Sethian gnostics. d. The twelve kingdoms may be modeled on the twelve tribes of Israel. In the LXX of Gen 10:2 and 10:6 there are twelve sons of Japheth and Ham. For the twelve plus one, cf. the thirteen kingdoms mentioned below, which have parallels in the Nag Hammadi documents such as the Gospel of the Egyptians (Codex DI, 63, 18: thirteen aeons) and Marsanes (Codex X, 2,14-4,23: thirteen \"seals\"). 5 a.

The biblical model for the apocalyptic de­struction by fire is the story of Sodom and Gomorrah in Gen 19:24-28. The scheme of destruction first by flood, then by fire, is well known in Jewish and Christian apocalyptic sources; cf. e.g. LAE 49:3-50:2. In Ant 1.2.3 Josephus portrays Adam as having predicted these events to Seth. d. The \"luminaries\" or \"lights\" are the sun and the moon. The darkening of them is a common apocalyptic theme in biblical contexts. e. Clouds of light or bright clouds are a common means of ascent to the heavens in the pseudepigra­pha as well as in gnostic literature; cf. e.g. TAb 9 (rec. A). f. In various combinations these three names occur frequently in the gnostic literature from Nag Hammadi and elsewhere, usually designating an­gelic beings in a gracious or protective role, e.g. Gospel of the Egyptians 52, 19-53, 9. 6 a. Though the coming of the Illuminator has not been mentioned previously, this is the \"third time\" in relation to the rescue of the race of Seth in the Flood and the fire. In an important parallel passage in the Gospel of the Egyptians (63, 4-8) the great Seth passes through \"three Parousias\": \"the Flood, and the conflagration, and the judgment of the rulers and the powers and the authorities.\" In that work, Seth in his third Parousia is identified with Jesus; here such an identification is not explicit if indeed it is intended at all. b. The Gk. word, phoster, is used elsewhere in ApAdam to refer to the sun and the moon. As a title it is widely used in Christian, gnostic, and Manichean sources to refer to the savior figure, e.g. Hippolytus, Refutation 5.8.40; Letter of Peter to Philip (Codex VIII, 139, 15). Compare the phrases \"the light of knowledge\" in TLevi 4:3, the \"light of the nations\" in Isa 42:6, and \"the light of the world\" in Jn 8:12; 9:5. * c. The metaphor of fruit-bearing trees for people is found in the NT but is already traditional. See also PssSol 14:215] and OdesSol ll:16a-21. d.

Cf. also ICor 2:6-8. e. The scene of the punishment of the Illuminator presupposes the kind of Docetism familiar in gnostic accounts of the passion of Jesus.

WINTERMUTE The Apocalypse of Elijah is a composite work that contains the following: an opening homiletical section that discusses prayer and fasting (ch. 1); a phophetic description of events that precede the advent of the Antichrist (ch. 2); a description of the Antichrist (ch. 3); an account of three martyrdoms (ch. 4); and oracles depicting events that are to occur \"on that day\" (ch. 5). The title of the present work is given at the end of the Akhmimic text as tiapoklupsis nheleias: \"The Apocalypse of Elijah.\" That title might lead one to expect the work to contain an account of secret lore revealed by an angelic messenger to Elijah, but it does not. The work begins in the form of a prophecy spoken by a figure who is identified simply as \"son of man,\" a title that was used of Ezekiel (Ezek 2:1) in the Old Testament. Within the text, Elijah is mentioned twice, both times in the third person and in association with Enoch. The fact that Elijah is mentioned in the text might explain why his name was joined to the title, but it will be argued below that the portions of text that refer to Elijah and Enoch are Christian interpolations added to an earlier Jewish work. If that is true, the title of the original Jewish work remains unknown. The designation \"apocalypse\" is also a somewhat inadequate description of the basic document. An apocalypse, i.e. \"revelation,\" usually contains the account of a secret revelation conveyed to a seer by an angelic messenger who directs that the revelation be written down for the benefit of those who will remain faithful in the last days. The present document does not have such a framework. The writer presents his opening statements as \"the word of the Lord,\" which comes to him in a normal prophetic form (cf. Ezek 6:1; 12:1; 13:1). Although the point of view changes in the document, there is no evidence to suggest that the writer begins to assume the role of an apocalyptic seer. The fact that the document is not written in apocalyptic form leads one to ask why it is called an apocalypse. The answer is to be sought in an examination of the type of material contained in the document. Much of the portrayal of the final days of the present age is typical of the apocalypses. In fact, there is reason to believe that the description of the martyrdom of Enoch and Elijah (in ch. 4) is strongly influenced by the account of two martyrs in Revelation 11:4-12. In other words, the present text, which is not written in the form of an apocalypse, contains passages that may rightly be described as apocalyptic inasmuch as they are similar to descriptions found in works constructed in the form of an apocalypse. Not only the Christian editor who inserted the Enoch-Elijah martydom but also other early readers would have been aware of its dependence on Revelation. Consequently, the final Christian edition of this text, which described the martyrdom of Elijah in an \"apocalyptic\" manner, came to be designated \"The Apocalypse of Elijah.\" A closer analysis of the structure of this work reveals its composite nature more clearly: Chapter J The first chapter contains a prophetic homily encouraging fasting and prayer. This is possibly an early Jewish work that has been supplemented by a Christian editor. The original Jewish homily would have had the following structure:"},{"pageNumber":775,"pageContent":"1. Introduction: a description of the call of a prophet who is identified as a \"son of man\" (1:1). 2. Exhortation: \"remember'' what is prepared for the sealed and for the sinners (1:8-12). 3. Exhortation: \"hear\" about deceivers who will appear in the last days and oppose the fast (l:13f.). 4. Exhortation: \"remember\" the benefits of a pure fast, which was created by God (1:15-22). 5. Closing comment: the value of single-mindedness, and a simile comparing the farmer's tool and the soldier's breastplate to single-mindedness (1:23-27). The Christian editor who added 1:3-7 was aware of the homiletical structure of the work and so he added his comments in a similar form. After the prophet's call, he also added a quotation from 1 John 2:15 (at 1:2), which contains an imperative that aptly suits the homiletical style. Neither of these added comments have anything to do with fasting and prayer, which constituted the main concern of the earlier Jewish composition. They are, however, the-matically related to the larger text, which deals with the judgment of the Antichrist and the salvation of the saints. That would indicate that the Christian editor had much of the present text before him when he began his editing. It is obvious that additional verses in chapter 1, particularly 1:8-12, might be regarded as the work of a secondary Christian editor. In fact, there is nothing in any part of chapter 1 that could not be regarded as the work of a Christian writer. Nevertheless, it is clear that the verses that are most intrusive and irrelevant to the basic theme of prayer and fasting are verses 1:2-7 (possibly 8-12), which contain explicit quotations and themes drawn from the New Testament. Chapter 2 The second chapter is the most difficult portion of the text to analyze. That is due in part to the fact that the recently published Chester Beatty Papyrus has added some fifteen verses (2:15b-30b) to the chapter, increasing its length by more than one fourth and drastically changing the presumed scenario. The scholarly community has not yet had an opportunity to examine the text and make its contribution to a study of the many tantalizing questions that it raises. The difficulties involved in an attempt to understand this chapter are aggravated by the problem of identifying the genre involved. The chapter attempts to provide a description of events preceding the advent of the Antichrist. At first impression it appears to fit somewhere in the continuum of Jewish and Christian apocalyptic prophecies, which extend from Daniel to 6 Ezra. It seems to share with them a method of surveying history in the form of future predictions that make use of such coded expressions as \"a king who rises in the north\" (2:3, cf. Dan 11:6) or \"in the west\" (2:6, cf. Dan 8:5) or the three \"kings of Persia\" who will struggle with four \"kings of Assyria\" for three years (2:42). Since the code is unclear, both the interpretation and the dating of this chapter remain uncertain. Chapter 2, together with chapter 5, also shares another literary feature with the type of apocalyptic prophecy found in Daniel. That is the tendency to repeat certain characteristic motifs and even to restate the same sequence of events in several different forms. Thus chapters 2, 7, 8, and 11 of Daniel abound in descriptions of beasts, kingdoms, and horns. They speak of powers arising with \"four winds of heaven\" (Dan 7:2; 8:8) and a kingdom that will never be destroyed (Dan 2:44; 7:14). The same chapters of Daniel provide four different descriptions of the sequence of Median-Persian, Greek, and Seleucid kingdoms which precede the final age. In a similar manner chapter 2 of the Apocalypse of Elijah repeats the notice that \"your children will be seized\" (2:4, 30), the land or cities of Egypt \"will groan\" (2:4, 31), many will \"desire death, but death will flee\" (2:5, 32) from them, and good rulers will \"take vengeance\" (2:8, 48) on the land of Egypt. Chapter 2 also appears to give two different accounts of events preceding the advent of the son of lawlessness. The chapter begins with a description of the desperate plight of those who live in Egypt. The women who bear children are tormented and lament their giving birth. At that point Persian kings intervene and remove the Jews from Egypt to Jerusalem, and we are informed that \"the son of perdition"},{"pageNumber":776,"pageContent":"will soon come.\" The following oracle begins \"In those days the lawless (one) will appear in the holy places,\" but at that point the text breaks off and the writer returns to discuss the Persian rise to power in much greater detail. This time the author describes how a native king from Heliopolis assisted the Persians in their conquest of Memphis. Finally, at the end of the chapter the king from Heliopolis is fully established in power and his reign is characterized by a short-lived era of peace, which immediately precedes the coming of the son of lawlessness. The most difficult problem to be resolved in the study of the Apocalypse of Elijah is the historical significance of the various kings mentioned in the text. There are at least three possibilities: 1. All of the kings are drawn from a literary tradition, and the author himself believes or speculates that at some future date the first of these kings will appear. 2. Some of the kings had already appeared, but the author casts his work in the style of a seer who desires to warn his contemporaries of the imminent end of the age by joining their own history to that of the final age and casting it all in the form of a future prophecy. 3. The author has made use of a prior literary tradition or even a complete apocalypse from an earlier time, which he brought up to date by modifying details of the predicted future to conform more accurately to the actual course of history as he knew it. Chapter 2 may be outlined in the following manner: 1. An introductory subtitle (2:1). 2. A description of historical events that will precede the advent of the Antichrist (2:2-28). 3. A lament for Egypt \"in those days\" (2:29-38). 4. A homiletical aside and announcement of the appearance of the lawless one (2:39f.). 5. A further description of historical events \"in those days,\" which will precede the advent of the Antichrist (2:41-53). The introductory subtitle in 2:1 introduces the remainder of the tractate, which begins with the discussion of an Assyrian king (2:3) and ends with a destruction of heaven and earth and the creation of new ones (5:23, 30, 38). If the subtitle has been correctly identified, its presence would suggest that the present work was created when an editor or writer joined the opening homily on fasting and prayer to an independent document that is described by this subtitle. The first description of coming events, which begins at 2:2 and ends at 2:28, contains a series of references to kings who cannot be identified at this time. It clearly begins with an Assyrian king who is wicked. He is replaced by a pious king from the west. The new Chester Beatty Papyrus introduces an evil, demon-faced son (vs. 19), who seems to be responsible for the evil events described in verses 24-27. The lament for Egypt begins in verse 2:29. It is characterized by a loose literary description of times of affliction, and (with the exception of a mention of three Persian kings in vs. 39) lacks specific allusion to political events. The lament is also characterized by the recurring phrase \"in those days,\" which continues to the end of the chapter. This lament for Egypt begins immediately after the writer informs us that \"the priests of the land will tear their clothes.\" The author may have intended the lament to represent the response of those priests. At the point where the lament ends, there is a homiletical aside addressed to the same priests of the land. Verse 2:41 begins with the phrase \"in those days,\" which generally introduces a larger paragraph. In this case, however, it simply contains an announcement that the lawless one will appear. One might expect the author to begin his treatment of that important figure at this point, but he immediately drops the subject and turns once again to events preceding the appearance of the son of lawlessness, whose more complete introduction is delayed until chapter 3. Chapter 2 ends with the discussion of a war between Persians and Assyrians. In the midst of their struggle for Egypt, a native ruler appears at Heliopolis, sides with the Persians, and comes to power in Memphis as a righteous king. This portion of text is heavily influenced by a literary tradition that appears in the Oracle of the Potter,1 an Egyptian text from the 1 SeeC. C. McCown. \"Egyptian Apocalyptic Literature,\" HTR 18 (1925) 397-400; L. Koenen, \"Die Prophezeiungen des Topfers,\" Zeitschrift fiir Papyrologie und Epigraphie 2 (1968) 178-209."},{"pageNumber":777,"pageContent":"end of the third century B.C., surviving in three fragmentary Greek versions dated between the first and third centuries A.EK That text presents itself as an oracle given by a potter to King Amenophis concerning things that shall come to pass in Egypt. It was produced by native Egyptians who resented Greek domination of their land from Alexandria, which is referred to as \"the city oy the sea\" that will be reduced to a place where fishermen dry their nets. Both the cities of Heliopolis, where the potter is buried in honor, and Memphis, where native rule should flourish, are mentioned favorably. The heart of the prophecy, however, is the prediction that a native king who will rule bountifully will appear from the sun and be established by Isis so that those who survive will call upon the dead to arise and share the good things with them. The literary tradition regarding that native king obviously plays a part in the righteous king from the \"city of the sun\" (2:46) who comes to power in Memphis and introduces \"abundant well being\" (2:52) so that the living will say to the dead, \"Rise up and be with us in this rest\" (2:53). It can be concluded, therefore, that in addition to apocalyptic motifs inherited from Jewish and Christian literature, the author has drawn on motifs attested in Egyptian apocalyptic writing. Chapter 3 This chapter contains a discussion of the following matters: 1. The advent of the son of lawlessness (1:1). 2. The signs of the advent of the true Christ (1:2-4). 3. The works of the Antichrist (1:5-13). 4. The physical signs of the Antichrist (1:14-18). The main concern of this section is the figure of the son of lawlessness, who falsely claims to be the Christ. His works are reported and his physical signs given. The description of the advent of the true Christ (1:2-4) is obviously a digression inserted by a Christian editor of this work. The descriptions of the physical signs of the Antichrist, however, are well known from such late Hebrew texts as the Apocalypse of Zerubbabel, the Prayer of Simon ben Yochai, the Signs of the Messiah, and Midrash Wayissou, which were published by A. Jellinek in his Bet ha-Midrash.2 Although there are also parallel descriptions in later Christian texts, it is difficult to believe that Jewish writers would borrow their basic description of the physical appearance of the man of lawlessness from Christians. Therefore, it may be assumed that the parallel portions of our present text originated in Jewish circles. Of course, in its present form the entire section was reworked by a Christian editor who inserted the description of the true Christ and modified the description of the works of the Antichrist to agree with a Christian typology. From chapter 3 we learn little about the speaker or his audience, which is addressed in a homiletical style (cf. e.g. 3:1, 13f., 18). There is also little evidence for dating this section; all that can be said is that the description of the true Christ is post-Christian, and that it is later than the Jewish document to which it was joined. Chapter 4 This chapter may be outlined in the following manner: 1. The martyrdom of Tabitha (4:1-6). 2. The martyrdom of Elijah and Enoch (4:7-19). 3. The persecution of the righteous (4:20-29). 4. The martyrdom of the sixty righteous men (4:30-33). One of the noticeable literary features of this section is the manner in which the martyrdoms parallel one another. The following chart displays the most obvious parallels: TABITHA will hear that the shame­less one has revealed him­self in the holy place she will put on her garment ELIJAH-ENOCH will hear that the shame­less one has revealed him­self in the holy place SIXTY MARTYRS will hear they will gird on the breastplate 2 A.

Most interpreters of Revelation identify the two witnesses described there as Elijah and Moses, but from the time of Hippolytus onward a number of Church Fathers reinterpreted the passage in Revelation to apply to Enoch and Elijah, the two men who had never died. Since Elijah was taken to heaven in a fiery chariot (2Kgs 2:11), it was generally assumed that he never died. The case for Moses, although less clear, was made in certain Jewish circles because the burial place of Moses was never found (Deut 34:5f.). The case for Enoch was stronger than the one for Moses, and probably much older since it is clearly set forth in 1 Enoch. Consequently, it was possible for Christian exegetes to replace Moses with Enoch, particularly if they had misgivings about Moses' reputed longevity.3 The Martyrdom of Tabitha was also composed by a Christian author. The name, which means \"gazelle,\" is that of a woman from Joppa, who was also known as Dorcas. In Acts 9:36-41 a story is told of the manner in which Peter raised her from the dead. Lacking any report of her subsequent death, it must have been assumed that she was still alive and would survive in order to serve as a witness in the last days. Her speeches are quite similar to those of Enoch and Elijah, and like them she is resurrected to deliver a concluding rebuke to the shameless one. When we turn to the story of the sixty martyrs, the account is much simpler. It has nothing that marks it as distinctively Christian. There is no resurrection. There is nothing to suggest that the sixty men previously shared the \"deathless\" nature of the first three martyrs. When they speak of the powers of the shameless one, they liken them to the powers \"which the prophets have done,\" a phrase that contrasts with a Christian version in 3:12, \"He will do the works which the Christ did.\" The context in which the third martyrdom is set is smoother than that of the earlier martyrdoms. Tabitha heard about the appearance of the shameless one and accused him of being \"hostile to all the saints,\" but the persecution of the saints had not yet been described. In the case of the sixty, however, they girded on their armor and fought with the shameless one in response to the persecution of the saints after it is fully described. The present location of this martyrdom is anticlimactic. The first two martyrdoms are far more spectacular. Tabitha was resurrected to scold a second time. Enoch and Elijah are resurrected, scold and fight again, and apparently ascend in full view of all the people of the world. It is difficult to see why anyone would want to add a relatively simple martyrdom tale concerning sixty pious men immediately after such a spectacular account. It is more reasonable to assume that the spectacular accounts were inserted into an original martyr tale written on a more modest scale. In view of the preceding arguments, the present section may be understood to have 3 For a brief discussion on the manner in which Enoch came to be more highly regarded in Christian circles than in early rabbinic circles cf.

A later Christian editor inserted the first two martyrdoms. There are also some features in the account of the persecution of the saints, such as the dominical words of the Christ in 4:27, that suggest that the Christian editor expanded the original persecution scene. As with chapter 3 we learn little about the speaker, although he could be a prophet. This chapter lacks the type of direct address that was found in the previous chapter. It is written in a narrative style and was possibly intended for general circulation within the Jewish and Christian communities. The section does not contain any specific historical allusions that might be of significance for dating either its Christian or Jewish strata. Chapter 5 The oracles in the final chapter describe the following events: 1. Many who witness the persecution of the righteous flee from the Antichrist and denounce him (5:1). 2. The Christ sends angels to save those who are sealed. Gabriel and Uriel lead them to paradise (5:2-6). 3. Cosmic signs occur and sinners rebuke the Antichrist because he misled them so that they are destined to suffer famine and thirst (5:7-14). 4. The Antichrist laments his end, pursues the saints, and fights against the angels (5:15-21). 5. There is a description of a cosmic fire (5:22f.). 6. The byways speak describing the coming judgment (5:24-29). 7. After a description of the Lord's judgment, Elijah and Enoch return to kill the son of lawlessness (5:30-32). 8. There is a description of the death of the Antichrist (5:33-35). 9. The chapter concludes with a description of the beginning of the millennium (5:36-39). The series of oracles found in this section is somewhat difficult to analyze. There are no specific historical references. The material is drawn from traditional apocalyptic lore common to both Judaism and early Christianity. On the basis of what we have concluded about the admixture of Jewish and Christian materials in the previous sections, we are inclined to confront the present section with the a priori assumption that it contains an early Jewish stratum that has been supplemented by a Christian editor. Unfortunately, the process of disentangling the Jewish and Christian strata will require a considerable amount of further research. At this point in our research we can only point to isolated examples that support our a priori assumption. One example of the mixing of Jewish and Christian strata may be seen at 5:2-6, where there appear to be two slightly different versions of the salvation of the saints. The second version may well be the earlier one. It describes the return of the saints to Eden in terms of the Exodus motif. \"Gabriel and Uriel will become a pillar of light leading them into the holy land.\" The version that now stands first is somewhat more elaborate and betrays a Christian inclination. The Christ will send sixty-four thousand angels to save \"those upon whose forehead the name of Christ is written.\" That statement should be contrasted with the statement in 1:9, where it is \"the Lord\" who is quoted as saying that \"I will write my name upon their forehead.\" The reference in 5:11 to \"the Christ who created us\" also helps to identify this portion of the text as the work of a Christian writer. A second example of the mixing of strata may be seen in the doublet concerning the burning of the earth. The earlier version occurs at 5:22f., where \"the Lord\" commands the fire that prevails over the earth in a manner reminiscent of the Flood story. The Christian version is found at 5:36f., where \"the Christ\" comes forth with his saints and it is reported that \"He will burn the earth.\" There is no clear identification of either the speaker or the audience in this chapter, but presumably it is intended to be taken as the word of a prophet addressed to the larger community of Christians and Jews. The chapter opens with people fleeing from the Antichrist, who persecuted sixty righteous men in Jerusalem; but the scene is enlarged in this section when the writers begin to describe the final events on a cosmic scale."},{"pageNumber":780,"pageContent":"Text Until recently, the two most important manuscripts of the Apocalypse of Elijah were those edited by G. Steindorff.4 The earliest manuscript, which Steindorff dated in the fourth century, was written in Akhmimic, and the second manuscript, which he dated at the beginning of the fifth century, was written in Sahidic. In addition to the Apocalypse of Elijah, both manuscripts contained the text of the Apocalypse of Zephaniah. The history of both of these manuscripts was discussed in the introduction to the Apocalypse of Zephaniah, to which the reader is referred. In addition to the two manuscripts published by Steindorff, fragments of two additional manuscripts have long been available. One was written in Sahidic and the other in Greek. The Sahidic fragment, which contains only the opening section of the text, was written at the end of a manuscript now preserved in the British Museum as Orient. 7594; it was published by E. A. W. Budge in 1912.5 The manuscript contained the books of Deuteronomy, Jonah, and Acts. The Sahidic fragment itself was added in a later hand and has been dated in the first half of the fourth century.6 The Greek fragment contains only a few words that parallel the Akhmimic text at 5:30-32. Nevertheless, it is an important witness to support the assumption that there was a Greek text underlying the present Coptic texts. It also bears witness to the close relationship between the Greek text and the Akhmimic translation. The fragment, which was first published by E. Pistelli,7 was also dated in the fourth century. Of the manuscripts available at the time when the present translation was begun, the Akhmimic manuscript was the most complete. Consequently, the Akhmimic text was chosen as the basis for the translation presented here. After that translation was completed, a new papyrus manuscript (4th-5th cent.) from the Chester Beatty Library and Gallery of Oriental Art (inventory no. 1493) was edited by A. Pietersma, S. T. Comstock, and H. Attridge.8 During the final stages of preparing the present work for publication, the editors of the Chester Beatty Papyrus very generously permitted me to make use of a prepublication version of their text so that it was possible to take advantage of many of its readings to supplement and improve the present translation. The Chester Beatty Papyrus is the most complete manuscript now available. It is written in Sahidic and covers ten folios, which contain the text of the Apocalypse of Elijah from verse 1:1 to 5:15a. Inasmuch as the Akhmimic text contains three lacunae, it had to be supplemented by following the Sahidic text. The only manuscript evidence available for the Sahidic text at the time the translation was begun was the manuscript published by Steindorff,9 and that was used to fill in two lacunae. It was not possible to fill in the third lacuna until a copy of the Chester Beatty Papyrus was made available, because it is the only manuscript that contains that portion of the text. As a result of the procedure that had to be followed, the basic text used for the present translation is the Akhmimic version, but it was supplemented by readings taken from Sahidic manuscripts in the following manner: Chapter 1:1-2:15b follows the Akhmimic text. Chapter 2:15b-2:30a follows the Chester Beatty Papyrus. Chapter 2:30b-4:2 follows the Akhmimic text. Chapter 4:3-4:15a follows the Sahidic manuscript edited by Steindorff. Chapter 4:15b-5:13a follows the Akhmimic text. Chapter 5:13b-5:23a follows the Sahidic manuscript edited by Steindorff. Chapter 5:23b-5:39 follows the Akhmimic text. 4 Die Apokalypse des Elias, eine unbekannte Apokalypse und Bruchstiicke der Sophonias-Apokalypse. 5 Coptic Biblical Texts in the Dialect of Upper Egypt, pp. lv-lvii, 270f. 6 See the review of Budge's work by W.

Rosenstiehl\" have provided surveys of ancient witnesses to apocryphal works that have been attributed to Elijah. There are three types of witnesses: early lists of canonical and noncanonical works, citations in early Christian writings, and a complete Hebrew text also known as the Apocalypse of Elijah. The most important lists are: the Stichometry of Nicephorus, the closely related Synopsis of Sacred Scripture of Pseudo-Athanasius, the Catalogue of the Sixty Canonical Books, and a list of ancient works preserved in the Apostolic Constitutions. Most lists do not provide much information about the text beyond the canonical status and the title, which may appear in a slightly different form from list to list. The Stichometry of Nicephorus, however, reports that the length of the work was 316 stichoi (lines). On the basis of that bit of information, Steindorff12 noted that the work was approximately the same length as Paul's Epistle to the Galatians. He then compared the length of a Coptic (Bohairic) text of Galatians with the length of the Coptic (Akhmimic) text of the Apocalypse of Elijah and discovered that the Apocalypse of Elijah was about 7 percent shorter than Galatians. Nevertheless, Bohairic may be written a bit more pleonastically than Akhmimic, and the parallel is probably close enough to represent a recension of the Apocalypse of Elijah cited in the Stichometry of Nicephorus. An argument of that type merely establishes the possibility that the present text is the one mentioned by Nicephorus. The possibility is strengthened by two facts: First, it is significant that we have five surviving manuscripts of the present work. That would indicate that it was rather widely used, an important criterion for a work to be included in the ancient lists. Secondly, it should be noted that the present text circulated in two separate manuscripts with the Apocalypse of Zephaniah. In the lists of Nicephorus and Pseudo-Athanasius, the two works are listed side by side. In the Catalogue of the Sixty Canonical Books the order of books is: the Apocalypse of Elijah, the Vision of Isaiah, and the Apocalypse of Zephaniah. At the present stage of research, we can only speak of the possibility that the ancient lists referred to the present Apocalypse of Elijah because citations in early Christian writings clearly bear witness to other works attributed to Elijah. In his Commentary on Matthew (27:9) Origen traced Paul's quotation in I Corinthians 2:9 to the Apocalypse of Elijah (in Secretis Eliae). Jerome (Epistle 101 to Pammachius and Commentary on Isaiah, vol. 17) did not deny that the quotation was to be found in the Apocalypse of Elijah, but he denies that Paul was dependent on an apocryphal work. The relevant point, however, is that the ancients were familiar with an Apocalypse of Elijah that spoke of things \"which the eye has not seen nor the ear heard.\" No such phrase is to be found in our apocalypse. Three ancient witnesses attribute citations to Elijah without specifically identifying the work that contained them as the Apocalypse of Elijah. The first of these is Epiphanius (Advtiaer 42), who claimed that the quotation in Ephesians 5:14 was circulated \"in Elijah\" (empheretai para toi Eliai). That quotation is not found in the Coptic Apocalypse of Elijah. The second witness is the writer of the Pseudo-Titus Epistle.13 He attributed a description of souls tormented in Gehenna to \"the prophet Elijah.\" No such description is found in the Coptic Apocalypse of Elijah. The third witness is a Greek fragment published by F. Nau,14 which contains a description of the Antichrist quite similar to the description that appears in the Testament of the Lord; but the Greek description is introduced by the statement that \"Elijah the prophet spoke concerning the Antichrist.\" In that case, the fragment parallels an episode in the Coptic Apocalypse of Elijah that contains a description of the Antichrist, but the details of the two descriptions are quite different. The only other complete Apocalypse of Elijah to survive is a Hebrew text published by A. Jellinek.15 The Hebrew text is significantly different from the Coptic work. It more nearly approximates the form of an apocalypse. The text begins with a detail from 1 Kings 19:5, Ibid., pp. 20-22. \" L Apocalypse dElie, pp. 13-15. 12 Die Apokalypse des Elias, p. 14. 13 See HSW, vol. 2, p. 158. 14 F.

The vision begins with a brief spiritual tour of various heavenly regions, in which he sees a burning fire, stars in combat, and souls being judged according to their deeds. Then he is told that a false ruler (i.e. the Antichrist), who is known by many different names, will appear. A description of the \"signs\" of that ruler is given. This one section has close parallels with the Coptic Apocalypse of Elijah. Thereafter the Hebrew apocalypse describes the various kings who will appear at the end of the age, the advent of the Messiah, and various other eschatological events. Although both the Hebrew Apocalypse of Elijah and the Coptic Apocalypse of Elijah deal to some extent with similar matters, the only point of close verbal agreement is in the description of the signs of the Antichrist. When Jellinek first published the text of the Hebrew Apocalypse of Elijah, he traced its composition to Persia in the Gaonic period,16 but there is reason to believe that the writer made use of much earlier traditions. That possibility was rather clearly established with regard to the signs of the Antichrist by W. Bousset17 and more recently by J.-M. Rosenstiehl.18 One suspects that there are other antique traditions contained in the Hebrew Apocalypse of Elijah. Steindorff was probably correct in suggesting that it is possible that \"both writings have been partially created out of the same Hebrew source.\"19 Original language Portions of the text of the Apocalypse of Elijah have survived in both the Sahidic and Akhmimic dialects of Coptic as well as in Greek. It is generally assumed that the Apocalypse was translated from Greek, and there is no reason to deny that assumption, especially in light of the existence of a fragment of Greek text that has survived. When Steindorff published his edition of Die Apokalypse des Elias, he offered convincing evidence that the Sahidic version was translated from Akhmimic.20 The evidence was primarily in the form of unusual Akhmimic features that appeared in the Sahidic text which he edited. It seemed reasonable to assume that a translator of the Sahidic text found some puzzling constructions in the text from which he worked. Being unable to translate them or careless about translating every expression, he allowed them to enter the Sahidic text. In strong contrast to the Sahidic manuscript edited by Steindorff, the newly discovered Chester Beatty Papyrus provides a different sort of evidence. It contains essentially the same Sahidic text as that found in Steindorff's edition, but without the unusual Akhmimic features. It is also more extensive. On the basis of a limited study of the evidence provided by the new Chester Beatty Papyrus, it seems reasonable to conclude that the Akhmimic and Sahidic texts represent independent translations from the Greek. The problem deserves further study. The strange Akhmimic features in Steindorff's Sahidic manuscript remain puzzling. Perhaps they are due to a scribe whose native dialect was Akhmimic, thereby making him more familiar with the Akhmimic version. Date Since there are Coptic manuscripts of the present text dated to the early fourth century at the latest, the original Greek text can scarcely be later than the end of the third century. On the other hand, the text in its present form is obviously post-Christian. At verses 4:13f. there seems to be dependence on Revelation 11:8f. At verse 1:2 there is apparently a quotation from 1 John 2:15, a writing that shares with the Apocalypse of Elijah a concern for the last days and the coming of the Antichrist (Un 2:18). The dating of these documents from the Johannine circle remains a problem for New Testament scholars. Nevertheless, an extremely 16 Ibid., p. xviii. 17 The Antichrist Legend, trans. A. H.

Consequently, it is possible to set a reasonable date somewhere between A.D. 150 and 275 for the final composition of the present work. Such scholars as E. Schurer,21 W. Bousset,22 and J.-M. Rosenstiehl23 have concluded that the work must be dated after the middle of the third century, and it is probable that the document was composed closer to 275 than to 150. Nevertheless, most of the evidence used for dating the text will need to be revised in terms of the additional information provided by the new Chester Beatty Papyrus. Although the new portion of text is not large, it radically changes our understanding of chapter 2, the primary chapter consulted by previous scholars in an attempt to discover historical allusions of value for dating. Until scholars have time to appraise carefully the new material, the date of the final composition should be left open. Most scholars who have studied the Apocalypse of Elijah have concluded that it is a composite work containing both Jewish and Christian materials. The task of sorting out the various passages to be assigned to each group is still being pursued. Once that has reached a state of general consensus, it will be possible to examine the Jewish data separately and propose a date for its composition. That task should be carried out with a close examination of related Jewish works such as the Hebrew Apocalypse of Elijah,24 in order to determine more precisely the nature of a possible common ancestor. Until that is done, any statement about a date for the earlier Jewish material in this tractate remains too conjectural. Never­theless, the Jewish stratum seems to predate the destruction of the Jewish quarter in Alexandria in A.D. 117. Provenance The events described in chapters 3 and 4 are eschatological events that will take place in Jerusalem. They are part of the eschatological lore that anticipates the appearance of the Messiah in that city. Chapter 3, however, describes events that will occur in Egypt before the time of the Antichrist. It is that interest in Egypt which betrays the provenance of the writers of this work. The Jewish community in Alexandria may have been the home of the writer of the Jewish portions of the work. Chapter 2:15 apparently mentions the removal of \"the wise men\" to that city. It is quite possible that the Christian reworking of the document also took place in that city. One of the sources of the present work is the Oracle of the Potter,25 which expresses a very hostile attitude toward \"the city by the sea.\" In the present text, the hostility is removed, and the wise men are taken there in much the same way as Jews are returned to Jerusalem in 2:39. Theological concerns The theology of the present document is not the product of a single writer or community. It is only natural that a work that contains both Jewish and Christian strata would express different theological concerns in different parts of the document. Therefore, it is obvious that a simple survey of the various statements concerning God, angels, and men would scarcely do justice to the complexity of this important text. It is also obvious that no final statement can be made about the theological concerns of the several parts of the document until research on the present text reaches a point where there is general agreement on the respective Jewish and Christian components. Therefore, the following survey must be limited to an attempt to review the theological content of the text on the basis of our present understanding. A discussion of the theology of the various chapters of this document must distinguish between the earlier Jewish stratum and the later Christian additions. From a literary point of view, it is probable that the Jewish document itself was composed of several different 21 Geschichte des jiidischen Volkes im Zeitalter Jesu Christi (Leipzig, 1898-1901) vol. 3, p. 368. 22 Die Religion des Judentums in spdthellenistischen Zeitalter (Tubingen, 1926) p. 46. 23 L'Apocalypse d'Elie, p. 75. 24 Jellinek, Bet ha-Midrash, vol. 3, pp. 65-68. 25 C i"},{"pageNumber":784,"pageContent":"sources. It is quite likely that chapter 1, which deals with prayer and fasting, was once an independent document. However, there are only very slight differences between the basic theological framework of the Jewish portion of chapter 1 and the theology expressed elsewhere in the Jewish stratum. Consequently, it is possible to describe the Jewish theology contained within this document as a unity. The view of God expressed in the Jewish document is that he is the enthroned Creator of the heavens who has prepared a place for the righteous. One slight discrepancy between chapter 1 and the rest of the document is that in chapter 1 the place prepared with thrones and crowns is within a heavenly city. Elsewhere the place of the righteous is expressed in terms of Exodus typology as a \"place of rest\" or \"the holy land,\" which is likened to the garden of Eden, where the tree of life is found. The God who appears in the Jewish document may also be described as a Lord of history who raises up kingdoms and brings them down as he hastens this age to its end. The righteous kings are opposed to idols, confess that the name of God \"is one,\" and care for his house. God demands that his Law be obeyed, and prepares his wrath for sinners who disobey. Under his command are angels—including Gabriel and Uriel—who lead the righteous to their place of reward. There are also thrones of death who bar the way for the unrighteous, and there are demons who probably served to punish sinners. Within the world there is a dualism of good and evil. The righteous obey the Law and are part of the Covenant. The sinners disobey and are cut off from the Covenant so that they are under God's wrath. The kingdoms of the earth are also good or evil as each one follows in its turn. As history moves toward its culmination, two human leaders will appear. The one expected to lead the righteous is a prophet like Moses, who will perform signs and wonders. The text does not describe this messianic figure directly. Knowledge of the Messiah must be extrapolated from the figure of the lawless one, who is a false Messiah. The false Messiah, who rules as an earthly monarch, will also do the signs and wonders that the prophets did, but the righteous will be able to recognize him by the signs on his head. Although the forces of evil come to dominate at the end of the age under the rule of the lawless one who will torture and slay the righteous, this world is not regarded as totally evil. So long as the righteous remain in it, the sun will rise and the earth will bear fruit. It is only when the righteous are removed that natural calamities will abound and the sun will fail to rise. In its discussion of the final destiny of the righteous, the Jewish document contains an apparent discrepancy between chapter 1 and later sections of the text. In chapter 1, the righteous who die are led to a heavenly city by the angels. Elsewhere we are told that those who flee the lawless one will \"lie down as one who sleeps.\" Their spirit and soul returns to the Lord, but their body is turned into stone until the day of the great judgment when they will be resurrected and find a place of rest. Presumably the place of rest is the holy land, to which the righteous are led by Uriel and Gabriel. Although there is a conflict between this- view and the one expressed in chapter 1, the Jewish writer who joined the two together apparently saw none. He could easily have interpreted the journey to the heavenly city as the route the soul followed after death to await the day of judgment and resurrection. The destiny of the unrighteous is the opposite of that of the righteous. In chapter 1 they are prevented from reaching the heavenly city by the thrones of death. Elsewhere the wrath of God is brought upon them in the form of a final judgment by fire. They do not share in the rest. There is no way of knowing whether or not the writer expected the unrighteous to be resurrected for their final judgment. There is no specific mention of it. It is important to note the recurrence of the Exodus motif in the latter part of the document. It seems reasonable to assume that the writer's thinking about the Messiah and false Messiah was stimulated by Deuteronomy 18:18, 20. In verse 18 God promises to send a prophet like Moses, but in verse 20 he speaks of the false prophet who \"presumes to say in my name a thing I have not commanded him to say.\" The problem of discerning between the true and the false eschatological prophets was of crucial importance to the writer of this text. The Christian theology expressed in this text is strikingly different. This is true despite the fact that the Christian editor must have accepted in a general way the Jewish theology contained in the document he emended. In the Christian text, the merciful God of glory is virtually identified with the Christ, the Son of God. Both God and Christ are hailed as"},{"pageNumber":785,"pageContent":"Creator, and it is God who \"changed himself (to be) like a man when he was about to come to us so that he might save us.\" The dualism within the Christian additions is not between good and evil men, but it is between God and Satan. The son of lawlessness, the Antichrist, is identified with Satan in the same way that the Christ is identified with God. Within the world, the Christ is God incarnate and the Antichrist is Satan incarnate. Therefore the struggles are no longer those of human adversaries, but a cosmic struggle between God and Satan in an effort to remove man from captivity of this age and bring him to the kingdom of the Christ. The Christ is consistently portrayed as a triumphant divine figure, walking upon the clouds, shining like the sun, commanding sixty-four thousand angels. The Antichrist is painted in similar colors. He acts against heaven and is hostile to the thrones. He has fallen from heaven. He can do all of the works the Christ did except for giving life. In contrast to the Jewish theology, which saw the struggle between good and evil largely in terms of human adversaries who were righteous or sinful men, the Christian theology views man as virtually a helpless pawn in the larger cosmic struggle. The world is conceived of as totally evil. Men are captives. All that they can do is to refuse to love the world and endure in the face of martyrdom. Since this world is so dominated by evil, the chief concern of men is to escape. That is possible for the pious who have turned from the world to \"live in the Lord.\" The Antichrist has power to torture them and even kill them, but he has no power over their spirit or soul. The final destiny of the pious is to live in the kingdom of Christ in a new heaven and a new earth, which will replace this evil one. The fate of the Antichrist is to be destroyed in the judgment by Elijah and Enoch, but his death is no more final for him than it was for the pious. After death he is to be cast to the bottom of the abyss together with all who believe in him. Relation to canonical books In its present form the Apocalypse of Elijah reflects a familiarity with the major collections of books within both the Old and New Testaments. The Old Testament works most frequently alluded to are the books within the Pentateuch and Prophets. The Apocalypse of Elijah begins in the style of a prophetic writing. In the Akhmimic text the prophet is called \"son of man\" (1:1) in imitation of the prophet Ezekiel. At 5:5 there is an obvious use of the Exodus motif. From the collection of later writings, an allusion to Ecclesiastes 12:7 may appear at 4:25. The figure of the lawless one who will appear in the holy places is ultimately derived from the book of Daniel. Turning to the New Testament, the gospel tradition is most clearly reflected in the list of works the Antichrist will do in imitation of the true Christ (3:9f.). The influence of the Pauline corpus may be noted at many points, but it is most clearly illustrated at 2:41 and 3:1, which make use of the description of the advent of the man of lawlessness in 2 Thessalonians. Literature from the Johannine circle is used at 1:2, which contains a quotation from 1 John 2:15, and at 4:13-14, which is dependent on Revelation 1 l:8f. In light of the breadth of literary allusions that appear in this text, it is quite probable that the writer knew most if not all of the books of the Old and New Testaments. We cannot, of course, draw any final conclusion about the extent of his canon on the basis of that observation. Relation to apocryphal books In the notes that follow, attention is called to parallels that may be found in the Wisdom of Solomon and Sirach. Nevertheless, the parallels are not of such a nature as to suggest that the author of the Apocalypse of Elijah relied on those works. There are no a priori reasons why he might not have known that group of works traditionally referred to as the Old Testament Apocrypha, but neither is there clear evidence that he did. A similar observation may be made with regard to the larger group of anonymous Jewish writings composed between 200 B.C. and A.D. 200. The author discusses Enoch, but there is no obvious dependence on the books of Enoch. He shares apocalyptic motifs with the Sibylline Oracles and the Psalms of Solomon, but the very nature of apocalyptic speculation makes the source of such material difficult to determine."},{"pageNumber":786,"pageContent":"Introduction to the translation The translation is based on the Akhmimic text of the Apocalypse of Elijah where that is extant. When it is lacking, it is necessary to follow one or another of the Sahidic manuscripts. Chapters 4:3-4:15a and 5:13b-5:23b follow the Sahidic manuscript edited by Steindorff in Die Apokalypse des Elias. Chapter 2:15b-2:30a follows the Chester Beatty Papyrus edited by A. Pietersma, S. T. Comstock, and H. W. Attridge.26 In the notes that follow, reference is made to the Akhmimic text, the Sahidic text, and the several Sahidic manuscripts. Since there is only one Akhmimic manuscript, the designation \"Akhmimic text\" clearly refers to that unique manuscript. The term \"Sahidic text\" is used in an unqualified manner only when all of the Sahidic manuscripts available for that portion of the text agree. Otherwise the separate Sahidic manuscripts are named.

For the opening phrase compare Ezek 33:1-2; 6:1; 12:1; 13:1; 14:2. G. Steindorff in Die Apo­kalypse des Elias, p. 67, called attention to a very close parallel in the ApPaul, which reads: \"The word of the Lord came to me, saying, 'Say to this people, \"How long will you sin and add to the sin and anger the God who created you?\" ' \" (ApPaul 3). The last part of this quotation is parallel to the LXX version of Isa 30:1, which reads, \"to add sins to sins.\" The opening portion of this text has been pre­served in the Sahidic text written at the end of BM MS 7594. The best edition of that Sahidic text was provided by C. Schmidt in \"Der Kolophon des Ms. Orient. 7594 des Britischen Museums: Eine Un-tersuchung zur Elias-Apokalypse,\" Sitzungsbe-richte der Preussischen Akademie der Wissen-schaften, Philosophisch-Historische Klasse, pp. 312-21. The Sahidic text differs from the Akh­mimic slightly and is somewhat closer to the ApPaul. It reads \"The word of the Lord came to me, saying to me, 'Say to this people, \"Why do you sin and add (reading {n)tetnoueh, with Schmidt) sin to your sin and anger (reading (n)tetntidont, with Schmidt) the Lord God who created you? In agreement with the ApPaul the text of BM MS 7594 does not include the phrase \"son of man,\" but it does include the phrase \"why do you sin?\" A similar Sahidic text is provided by the new Chester Beatty Papyrus. In writing the phrase \"to me,\" the scribe cor­rected an original a to r in writing Sarai. The siglum { } indicates words (or letters) in the Cop. text that are otiose and, therefore, not translated. The siglum [| |] indicates a letter eliminated by the Cop. scribe in antiquity. The siglum < ) indicates a passage omitted by the scribe. b. The text of BM MS 7594 adds \"to me\" at this point. c. Reading aj {et} n. d. The word for anger in the Akhmimic text is tinouks.

An important motif in several gnostic texts from Nag Hammadi is the \"boasting\" of the chief ruler of this world. Cf. CG II 103, 9; 107. 30; 112, 28; 86, 30; 94, 21. The biblical background for the boasting of a demonic power may be traced to Dan 11:36-39; 2Thes 2:3-4. Cf. Ascenls 4:2. J.-M. Rosenstiehl in L'Apocalypse d'Elie, p. 79, called attention to a large number of parallel passages in the Pseudepigrapha as well as in other Jewish and Christian writings that share this writer's negative view of the present world and its domination by Satan. h. The style of this first section is homiletical. It was written to be preached. The literary units in this section begin with exhortations to \"remember\" or \"hear.\" These exhortations recall the rhetorical style of Deut. Cf. Deut 9:1; 6:4; 7:18; 8:2, 18; 20:3. Rosenstiehl, L'Apocalypse d'Elie, p. 29, has called attention to the similarity between 1:3 and 1:5. He thought that both sections were Christian interpolations, with intervening text from an earlier Jewish work. It is our opinion that the entire paragraph was introduced by the Christian editor. i. The Akhmimic text reads \"the Lord of glory.\" BM MS 7594 and the Chester Beatty Papyrus read only \"the Lord.\" The expression \"Lord of glory\" is a frequent epithet in IEn. Cf. IEn 22:14; 25:3; 27:3, 5; 36:4; 40:3; 63:2; 75:3; 83:8. If Milik's reconstruction of the Qumran fragments of IEn 22:14 is correct, the original Ar. phrase read mr' rbwt'. See his work The Books of Enoch: Aramaic Fragments (Oxford, 1976) p. 218. j. Reading etahtano nho(b) nim. BM MS 7594 and the Chester Beatty Papyrus read pentaftamie nka nim. Rosenstiehl, L'Apocalypse d'Elie, p. 80. has called attention to the juxtaposition of the double motif of Creator who also delivers from captivity. He notes the parallels in Isa 44:24f.; 40:21-26; 41:17-20. k. In the phrase \"had mercy upon you so that he might save us,\" Rosenstiehl, L'Apocalypse d'Elie, p. 80, assumed that the shift of pronoun was due to a confusion between the Greek words humin and hemin. It is also possible that a person writing in a homiletical style might have intended the shift. Compare the well-known pronominal change in the famous \"credo\" of Deut 26:5-10. 1. The idea of souls in captivity in this world was a widespread feature of gnostic theology. CG II 114, 20 contains a simple, basic statement of this doctrine. It reads \"And these are the ones who are taken captive by the First Father according to lot. And thus they were shut up in the prisons of the moulded bodies until the consummation of the eon.\" Cf. Eph 4:8."},{"pageNumber":789,"pageContent":"devil desired not to let the sun risem above the earth and not to let the earth yield Eph 4:8 fruit,\" since he desires to consume men like a fire0 which rages in stubble,p and Mai4:i 5 he desires to swallowq them like water/ •Therefore, on account of this,s the God Joei 2:5 of glory1 had mercy upon us, and he sent his son to the world\" so that he might Acts 7:2 6 save us from the captivity/ 'He did not inform an angel or an archangel or any Jn3:i7, io:36 principalityw when he was about to come to us,x but he changed himself to be like PHU 2:6-8 a many when he was about to come to us so that he might2 save us [from flesh].a2 7 Therefore become sons to him since he is a father to you.

Rosenstiehl, LApocalypse d'Elie, p. 80, calls attention to 5:18, where the writer claims that it is because of the saints that the sun shines above the earth. He also calls attention to a number of texts dealing with the deceits and plots of the devil. The present text contains a number of features that suggest an Egyptian origin. At this point, one is reminded of the Apophis myth. Apophis was a serpent of the Underworld who continually sought to hinder the sun god on his daily journey. For the Christian editor of this text, the devil, who is in­carnate as the Antichrist, may be conceived of as a serpent. Cf. 5:33, where the Antichrist is said to \"perish like a serpent which has no breath in it.\" n. Written ati[\\a\\]karpos. In 5:18 the fertility of the land is also attributed to the presence of the saints. o. BM MS 7594 and the Chester Beatty Papyrus read \"the fire.\" p. Reading etpet hn ourdoui, lit. \"which runs within straw.\" The reading is supported by BM MS 7594 and the Chester Beatty Papyrus, which read efpet hn ourooue, but the Akhmimic MS reads efpet hn outyray,\" lit. \"who runs with a shout\" or \"roar.\" Cf. IPet 5:8. Rosenstiehl, L Apocalypse d'Elie, p. 115, has cited the following parallels for the figure of fire-destroying stubble: Ex 15:7; Isa 5:24; Nan 1:10; Mai 3:19; Joel 2:5; WisSol 3:7; lEn 48:9; 6Ezra 15:23; 1QM 11.10. q. The Cop. word for \"swallow\" is dmk. It was translated \"consume\" in the preceding line. r. One tradition that developed in the OT was the view that the world, which had once been destroyed by a flood, was threatened with a future destruction by fire. Cf. Zeph 1:2-3, which recalls the flood imagery of Gen 7:4, 23, and Zeph 1:18. The fire imagery is a figure rooted in the practice of herem, which involved burning all the booty after a holy war. When the wicked are finally destroyed in a cosmic holy war, all things will be consumed by fire. Cf. Joel 2:30; 2Pet 3:10. In the present text, however, it is the devil who is held responsible for the desire to consume men like fire and like water. Rosenstiehl, LApocalypse d'Elie, p. 80, sees the devil as the executive of God's wrath against Sodom (fire) and against the sinners of Noah's time (water). He also notes the imagery in Ex 15:4-7; Rev 12:15; and Hos 5:10, which is quoted in CD 19.15. s. BM MS 7594 and the Chester Beatty Papyrus read \"and on account of this.\" They lack \"There­fore.\" t. At 1:3 the Akhmimic text reads \"Lord of glory,\" which is familiar from lEn. The expression \"God of glory\" is familiar from Acts 7:2 and Ps 29(LXX 28):3. The passage in Pss is based on a Heb.»/ hkbwd. Contrast the phrase mr3 rbwf, which Milik, Books of Enoch, identified as the Ar. ante­cedent for \"Lord of glory\" in Enoch. See n. i above. u. Reading aftnnau instead of the scribe's aftnnaf. The Chester Beatty Papyrus reads afhatn-noou, \"He will send.'' Passages such as Jn 3:17 and 10:36 immediately come to mind. Rosenstiehl, LApocalypse d'Elie, pp. 49, 80, compares the theology of Isa 63:8-9 (LXX) and cites a long list of Jewish texts that treat \"Son of God\" as a mes­sianic title. v. The scribe wrote aijmalosia for aichmalosia here and elsewhere. w. The phrase \"or any principality\" is lacking in BM MS 7594 and the Chester Beatty Papyrus. x. Steindorff, Die Apokalypse des Elias, p. 68, called attention to the parallel in Ep. ad Diognetum 7:2. Could this passage reflect a tradition contrary to the Lucan birth narratives? y. Cf. Phil 2:6-8. Rosenstiehl, LApocalypse d'Elie, p. 81, called attention to several Christian interpolations in the T12P: TAsh 7:3; TSim 6:5, 7; TBenj 10:7. z. BM MS 7594 breaks off at this point, except for a few fragments. It is lacking for about fourteen lines and resumes at vs. 1:13 of the Akhmimic text. a2. There is a lacuna in the Akhmimic text. The Chester Beatty Papyrus has preserved the writing \\s)arx, which would neatly fill the Akhmimic lacuna when joined with the preposition hn. b2. Cf. Rev 2:10; 20:4. Rosenstiehl, L Apocalypse d'Elie, p. 81, has already called at­tention to WisSol 5:16; lEn 108:12; 4Ezra 2:46; Ascenls 9:25; and 1QS 4.7. c2.

These are the angels of death that confront the wicked. Cf. ApPaul 15f. for an example of the plight of a wicked soul after death. n2. This phrase provides another example of the author's homiletical style. Rosenstiehl, L'Apocalypse d'Elie, p. 83, has called attention to \"the wise\" in Dan 11:33, 35; 12:3. He also noted the use of the term mskyl in a technical sense at Qumran. At 2:15 below 44the wise men\" are taken to the metropolis by the sea. o2. BM MS 7594 reads \"these deceivers.\" Ro­senstiehl, L'Apocalypse d'Elie, p. 83, cites TJud 19:4 and other texts where Satan is described as \"Prince of error.\" Cf. AsMos 7; Mt 24:11. ITim 4:1-5 provides an interesting counterpoint vis-a-vis the present text. Timothy describes those who en­join abstinence from foods as 4'giving heed to . . . doctrines of demons.\" In the present text, the author is attacking those who make their belly their God and fail to abstain. p2. Reading (e)taueire ntouhei nnounoute neu. The scribe wrote ntoune instead of nnoute. BM MS 7594 and the Chester Beatty Papyrus read ete peu-noute pe hetou, 4'whose belly is their God.\" Cf. Phil 3:19; 3Mac 7:11. q2. Rosenstiehl, L'Apocalypse d'Elie, p. 83, has noted that this discussion of fasting may be ex­plained in a Jewish context. The most important single cultic fast in the OT is related to the Day of Atonement; compare Lev 16:29-31; 23:27-32; Num 29:7. The expression for fasting in those passages is \"to afflict oneself.\" In SpecLeg 2.195, Philo says that a purpose of the fast that occurs on the Day of Atonement is to control the tongue, the belly, and the organs below the belly, a view of fasting similar to that of the present text. There are a number of passages that deal with the fasting of individuals as a work of piety. Cf. Ezra 10:6; Neh 1:4; Dan 9:3; Jdt 8:5-6; TReu 1:10; TSim 3:4. The practice was enthusiastically sup­ported by the Pharisees and other Jewish sects (Lk 18:12; Mt 6:16-18), including the followers of John the Baptist (Mk 2:18-20). The fact that Jesus' earliest disciples were accused of not fasting sug­gests that during the life of Jesus the freedom to fast or not to fast was still a debatable issue. r2. Reading eueipe mmau (n)Smmo atdiatheke mipnoute) in agreement with BM MS 7594 and the Chester Beatty Papyrus. For references to alienation from the Covenant see Eph 2:12; 4:18; 1 Clem 1:1; Deut 29:25; Jer 22:9; and frequently in the docu­ments from Qumran; cf. Rosenstiehl, L'Apocalypse d'Elie, p. 84. Both the sect of Qumran and the early Christians used 4'covenant\" as a technical term to describe their community. Cf. Jer 31:31; Jub 23:16-21. s2. The Akhmimic text uses the Gk. term apos-terei. BM MS 7594 and the Chester Beatty Papyrus have translated it as fode. t2. The Akhmimic text uses Spop for 4'prom­ises.\" BM MS 7594 and the Chester Beatty Papyrus have eret. These promises probably refer to the \"crowns\" and \"thrones\" mentioned in line 1:8. Cf. PssSol 12:8; Jas 1:12; 2:5. The NT frequently links the promises to the covenants with Abraham, Moses, and David, which were realized in the coming of the Messiah. Cf. Heb 11:13, 39-40, or 2Pet 1:2-4, where the ethical implications are spelled out. The present text does not contain any suggestion that these promises are to be realized in a messianic figure. u2.

After the word \"desires\" the text of BM MS 7594 has a lacuna which is larger than the parallel Akhmimic text can supply. The Chester Beatty Papyrus contains the phrase \"which change,\" i.e. \"changing\" or \"fickle desires.\" For the sense of the passage cf. Jas 4:1; IPet 2:11; Tit 2:12. Rosenstiehl, L Apocalypse d'Elie, p. 84, calls attention to Josephus, War 2.8.2, which speaks of the value the Essenes placed on resisting passions. Cf. TJos 4:8; 10:lf. The struggle against passions was a hellenistic commonplace. Cf. Plato, Phaedo 83b; Philo, LegAll 2.106; SpecLeg 2.195. a3. Reading ppo(ne)ros. The reading has been confirmed by the Chester Beatty Papyrus. BM MS 7594 preserved . . .]eros at this point. From here on the BM text breaks off, except for a few isolated letters. Schmidt, \"Der Kolophon,\" p. 315, sug­gests that approximately thirteen lines were lost. b3. The Cop. word Sobh (Akhmimic Sobtf) may be used to render the Gk. word ekkaio in the fig­urative sense in which it appears in Rom 1:27. It could also reflect the Gk. word phlego. The Chester Beatty Papyrus reads \"so that the evil [or evil one] will not deceive you.\" c3. Instead of \"a pure fast\" one could read \"clean\" or \"holy fast.\" In vs. 1:20, where the word is found again, the same adjective is used of \"hands\" and \"heart.\" Joel 1:14; 2:15 speak of sanctifying a fast. Rosenstiehl, LApocalypse d'Elie, p. 84, has noted that the discussion of fasting in this text parallels Isa 58:1-11. In both cases a true fast involves avoiding sin, but the present emphasis on \"purity\" or \"sanctity\" of the fast is lacking in Isa. d3. The Chester Beatty Papyrus reads \"which he has created.'' The use of the first-person pronoun seems to require that the quotation precede the phrase \"said the Lord.\" In reading the Sahidic text, it is possible to assume that the phrase \"The Lord said\" begins a new sentence, and that the phrase that follows is to be treated as a quotation. e3. In the Chester Beatty Papyrus the expression \"continually\" follows and clearly modifies the verb \"sin.\" In the Akhmimic text, the word order makes the reference of \"continually\" somewhat ambig­uous. It could be rendered \"The one who fasts will never sin,\" in agreement with the Chester Beatty Papyrus. 13. The passage that follows is probably not poetry in the strict sense, but the saying is expressed in obvious parallel construction. g3. Read (ou)nestia. Cf. 1:16.

A well-known purpose of fasting on the Day of Atonement is the release of sin. Cf. PssSol 3:8. 13. Although the phrase \"and fasting\" is gen­erally considered to be an addition to Jesus' dis­cussion of casting out demons at Mk 9:29, it reflects an ancient view of the importance of fasting for an exorcist. m3.

Rosenstiehl. L'Apocalypse d'Elie, p. 86, viewed the extended figure of speech that begins here as an addition. He thought it had the nature of a logion, which remains unidentified. The peas­ant and the mercenary suggested to him an origin in the Ptolemaic period, but soldiers and farmers are standard figures in any age. o3. Reading atkai{e) ejjieau with W.

We have altered the word order for clearer sense in English. p3. The words \"to fight\" are lacking in the Chester Beatty Papyrus. q3. The parallel Sahidic text published by Stein­dorff, Die Apokalypse des Elias, pp. 114-45, begins at this point. This phrase is preceded by the words mmof mmau, \"him there.\" This could be part of a slight variation of the Akhmimic sentence \"Will he not be killed?\" r3. Steindorff, Die Apokalypse des Elias, p. 74, restored dph[ik]ion. In Sahidic 1. S3, 2, the form is ophikion. Steindorff correctly identified the word as the Gk. ophphikion, which represents Lat. of-ficium. Rosenstiehl, L'Apocalypse d'Elie, p. 86, suggested that the use of a Lat. official term indi­cated a date after Diocletian in the 3rd cent, A.D., but that is not necessarily true. There is no reason why such a common Lat. term could not have entered Egypt much earlier. s3. Rosenstiehl, L'Apocalypse d'Elie, p. 86, has tracked down a long list of parallels for this passage, including 1QH 4.14; TAsh 3:1-4:1; Jas 4:8; and a very close parallel in the thirteenth canon pub­lished by A.

A similar use is probably intended here. To make the mind dark suggests creating a shady, furtive mentality within a man so that the angels will not trust him. v3. The Chester Beatty Papyrus reads \"If you become single-minded always in the Lord be wise in the time.\" The phrase in italics is lacking in Akhmimic. The Sahidic text published by Stein­dorff, Die Apokalypse des Elias, reads erri *ake hn pehroei. *ake should undoubtedly be read sabe, and hroei is quite possibly a corruption of the Akhmimic plural for the word hoou, \"day.\" There are a number of Akhmimic forms in that Sahidic text. w3. Translating nhate nim. The Sahidic text reads hob nim, \"everything.\" It is possible that the Akhmimic text is corrupt.

Restored on the basis of the Sahidic text pub­lished by Steindorff, Die Apokalypse des Elias. y. Cf. Zech 14:9 and Deut 6:4. According to the History of the Patriarchs, Patralogia Orientalis, vol. 1, p. 142, Mark's first convert in Alexandria was a cobbler whom the evangelist heard shouting heis ho theos, \"God is one.\" It is reported that Mark was surprised that the cobbler knew God's name. The story illustrates the fact that this formula had wide currency within both the Jewish and Chris­tian communities and elsewhere in the hellenistic world. In his volume entitled heis theos (Gottingen, 1926), E. Peterson traced the use of this formula in both Christian and non-Christian circles. In Christian circles outside Egypt there was a strong tendency to expand the acclamation to include either the name of Christ or both the name of Christ and the name of the Holy Spirit. z. The Sahidic text reads \"He will give glory to the priests of God.\" Rosenstiehl, LApocalypse d'Elie, p. 89, was persuaded that the reading of the Akhmimic text was incorrect at this point. The Sahidic reading, \"priests of God\" instead of \"saints,\" may be influenced by the use of these texts in monastic circles. The Akhmimic text used the expression \"priests of the land\" in vs. 2:40 to identify the audience addressed by the writer. The priests appear again at 4:21 together with the saints. The word that is translated \"saints\" is literally \"the ones who are pure\" or \"holy.\" It is the word that one would use to designate either the \"hasidim\" of the OT or the \"saints\" of the NT. a2. Rosenstiehl, LApocalypse d'Elie, p. 89, reads \"restoration.\" The Cop. word is jise, which means \"a lifting up,\" generally in the sense of \"praise.\" b2.

Both the Akhmimic and Sahidic texts pub­lished by Steindorff, Die Apokalypse des Elias, break off at this point. The Akhmimic text preserves only two letters, i.e. ou, from the quotation that follows. There is a single sheet (two pages) of papyrus missing from the Akhmimic text at this point.

They were kind enough to allow me to use the text that will appear under their names in the Texts and Translations: Pseudepigrapha Series, published by the Society of Biblical Literature. f2. The Chester Beatty Papyrus has a different reading. There is a preposition \"in\" before \"the markets\" so that the complete phrase \"in the mar­kets of the cities of Egypt'' is joined to the preceding sentence. A new sentence is then created by pro­viding a new pronoun so that the following sentence reads \"They will become dusty.\" g2. Restoring {te)pmou pot fkaoue. Restoring the conjunctive helps the sense of the passage and provides a precise parallel for the Cop. version of Rev 9:6. The Chester Beatty Papyrus reads awo ntemou pot nsabol mmoou, \"and death will flee from them.\" h2. The Chester Beatty Papyrus lacks the phrase \"In those days.\" i2. The Chester Beatty Papyrus adds \"but death flees from them.\" j2. The Chester Beatty Papyrus reads \"round about the whole land.\" k2. The Chester Beatty Papyrus adds \"in that time.\" 12.

Von Lemm, \"Kleine koptische Studien, X, 4-6,\" Bulletin de I'academie imperiale des sci­ences de Saint-Pitersbourg, 5e sene, 13 (1900) X, 4, clearly identified the Cop. word klo as the word for \"poison.\" In an extended discussion he con­cluded that it was a vegetable poison. The word that follows is sate, which could be the word for \"arrow,\" \"dart,\" or less likely an irregular Akh­mimic spelling of the Sahidic sate, \"fire,\" \"fiery.\" Assuming that it means \"arrow,\" the Sahidic form should be sote, but the Chester Beatty Papyrus has soto, a form more difficult to interpret. n2.

The passage that follows has a number of poetic characteristics. In addition to parallelism, there is a continual play on the contrast between \"earth\" and \"heaven.\" The two words are set in antithetical parallelism in 11. 1 and 2, where \"The midwife . . . upon the earth\" is set in parallel with the mother who \"will lift her eyes to heaven.\" There is a similar antithetical parallelism involving the same two words in the last two lines. By using the same type of parallelism in the opening and closing lines the writer has devised an enclosure that marks off the limits of the poem. The poem may be divided into two stanzas. The first four lines describe the lament of fertile women and the last four lines describe the rejoicing of childless women. The first stanza ends with the word \"earth,\" and the second stanza ends with \"heaven.\" q2. The Chester Beatty Papyrus adds \"then. And.\" r2. Reading tetasmise. The scribe wrote tatas-mise. s2. Lit. \"the brick.\" Cf. Ex 1:16, where the Heb. word 'bnym, \"stones,\" is used. They are translated \"birthstools.\" The Egyptian hiero­glyphic determinative for the word msi, \"to give birth,\" clearly portrays a woman giving birth in the squatting position that was normal when she was seated on a birthstool. t2. Lacau, \"Remarques,\" 190, would restore as(n)are$e. For the sense of the passage cf. Isa 54:1; WisSol 3:13; 2Bar 10:14-15; Lk 23:29. u2. The Akhmimic text writes \"heaven\" in the plural. The Chester Beatty Papyrus uses the sin­gular. v2. The Chester Beatty Papyrus reads \"and they will populate it for them again.\" w2. Rosenstiehl, L'Apocalypse d'Elie, p. 92, who followed an earlier reading of porj, \"divi­sion,\" wished to relate this passage to \"the house of division,\" which is apparently his translation of bytpig in CD 20, 22 and 4QpNah 4.1. The Chester Beatty Papyrus reads \"when you hear that there is security and safety in Jerusalem.\" The word I have translated as4 'safety'' is asphaleia, and its presence in the expanded reading of the Chester Beatty Pa­pyrus together with a preceding definite article in­dicates that the preceding noun should be read as 6rj, \"security,\" plus the definite article. The words orj and asphaleia are virtually identical in meaning. x2. This is a homiletical aside to the reader or hearers of this text, who are called \"priests of the land.\" This passage may simply reflect the use of the text in monastic circles. y2. Reading ip)Sere mpteko. Cf. Jn 17:12; 2Thes 2:3. z2. Lit. the text reads \"he will not delay before he comes.\" a3. The Chester Beatty Papyrus begins this sen­tence with the word \"Immediately.\" b3. Cf. 2Thes 2:8. Perhaps this figure is to be identified with \"the son of lawlessness\" at 3:1, 5. In Semitic parlance \"son of\" can simply mean \"one of a particular class. \"The son of lawless­ness\" could be rendered \"the lawless one.\" The Cop. construction describing the appearance of the \"lawless one\" here is similar to that used in 3:5 to describe the appearance of the \"son of lawless­ness.\" c3.

The scribe wrote a^rearit. Von Lemm, Bulletin de Vacad&mie impiriale des sciences de Saint-Pttersbourg, 5C sene, 21 (1904) XXVI, 14, provided a number of examples of armies \"standing to fight.\" He interpreted the idiomatic use of ohe erat to mean \"to stand over against hostilely.\" Lemm's emendation was fully justified on the basis of the Akhmimic text alone, but there is now evi­dence from the Chester Beatty Papyrus that makes Lemm's reading and that provided in the present translation questionable. Unfortunately the Chester Beatty reading contains a lacuna, but the remaining text reads [ . .]r[. . . . ] hit, which does not agree with what Lemm proposed. Lemm saw this section, with its battle between Persia and Assyria, as a recollection of Cyrus and Nebuchadnezzar. The mention of taking treasure from the temple in 2:43 recalled for him the activity of Nebuchadnezzar in Jer 52:19. The subsequent triumph over Assyrians in Memphis in 2:47 he attributed to the Persian kings who overthrew the Babylonians. e3. The Chester Beatty Papyrus reads \"carry off the wealth from that place.\" f3. The phrase \"In those days\" is lacking from the Chester Beatty Papyrus. g3. Steindorff, Die Apokalypse des Elias, pp. 84f., has identified this with the Arabic city of Qus, the ancient Apollinopolis Parva. It is located a few kilometers south of Coptos on the eastern bank of the Nile. h3. The Chester Beatty Papyrus reads \"in Egypt.\" i3. Most likely Heliopolis, biblical On. Cf. the LXX text of Gen 41:45; 46:20. The Cop. biblical texts translate the LXX form as tpolis mpre. j3. Instead of \"and\" the Chester Beatty Papyrus reads \"in those days.\" k3. Reading (fna)pdt with the Chester Beatty Papyrus. 13. The Akhmimic text does not contain the phrase \"with the Persians,\" but that is the sense of the passage. A native Egyptian king will arise in Heliopolis. By associating himself with the Per­sian kings and assisting them in the plot against Memphis, he will share in their triumph over the Assyrians and come to reign as the \"righteous king.\" The sequence of events is made clear by the new Sahidic text provided by the Chester Beatty Papyrus. I would translate the relevant passages in the following manner: \"In the sixth year of the kings, he will flee to Memphis with the Persians. He will plot an ambush in Memphis. He will kill the Assyrian kings. The Persians will take venge­ance on the land.\" By inserting a preposition and changing the per­sonal pronoun to third masculine singular at two points, the Sahidic text provides a slightly different reading, which clarifies the role of the king from Heliopolis. The Akhmimic text may be interpreted in a similar way, but prior to the publication of the Chester Beatty Papyrus its meaning was not ob­vious. m3. See n. 13 for the Sahidic translation up to this point. n3. The Sahidic text continues to describe the close cooperation between the Persians and the king from Heliopolis. I would translate it as follows: \"He will command and they will kill all the heathen and the lawless ones. He will command and they will plunder the temples of the heathen and they will exterminate the priests. He will command and they will build the temples of the saints.\" It should be noted that the Sahidic text is a bit longer than the Akhmimic text at this point. o3. The Chester Beatty Papyrus reads \"he.\" p3. The Cop. word oudSt can mean \"worship.\" It was a normal practice to extend divine honors to the rulers of Egypt, whether natives or con­querors. For example, the Persian kings, Cambyses and Darius, and the Macedonian king, Alexander the Great, were all accorded divine honors."},{"pageNumber":797,"pageContent":"52 sent us a righteous king so that the land will not become a desert.\" »He will Jer50:i2f command that no royal matter be presentedq3 for three years and six months/3 The Dan 7.25 53 land will be full of good in an abundant well-being. \"Those who are alive will go to those who are dead, saying, \"Rise up and bes3 with us in this rest.\"13 The advent of the son of lawlessness 1 3 In the fourth year of that king/ the son of lawlessness15 will appear, saying, Mt2*5 \"I am the Christ,\"c although he is not.

This passage presents the translator with a crux. The Akhmimic text reads lit. \"He will com­mand not to give any royal thing (or person).\" It has traditionally been emended to read \"He will command not to give anything to the king,\" but the emendation is not supported by the new Chester Beatty Papyrus, which reads \"He will command so that nothing royal will be given.\" One might speculate that the passage involves the suspension of certain royal taxes or royal honors. r3. Josephus, Ant 12.3.3, reports on a three-year remission of taxes for Judah which was ordered by Antiochus the Great. Earlier in Ant 11.8.5 Josephus reported that Alexander the Great agreed to remit taxes during the sabbatical year. s3. The Chester Beatty Papyrus reads' 'remain.'' t3. Cf. Ps 95:11; Heb 3:11, 18; 4:1-11. The psalmist equates \"the rest\" with the attainment of the land of promise. Subsequently writers easily identified the rest with the realization of eschato­logical promises in other forms. At this point in the text, the present writer uses a figure close to that found in Ps 95:11, although he has reinterpreted the good land of rest to apply to Egypt. Cf. the following NHL text On the Origin of the World, II, 122:34, \"These great signs appeared only in Egypt, signifying that it is like the Paradise of God.\" At 4:27 below, the author sets the place of rest in an eschatological context. Surprisingly, it is not part of the kingdom of the Messiah, but it is a lesser place. A writer who was in any way dependent on Heb. would probably not have made that sort of adjustment. It is our opinion that this discussion of \"rest\" goes back to the early Jewish stratum within the text. Cf. WisSol 4:7; TLevi 18:9; TDan 5:12. 3 a. The scribe left a space before the phrase \"in the fourth year of that king.\" Steindorff, Die Apokalypse des Elias, p. 86, suggested that it might be the result of the scribe's attempt to indicate a new section. The Chester Beatty Papyrus has preserved a longer reading at the beginning, which I would restore as hrai nteh[e nt] mahfto nromp[e, \"In the beginning of the fourth year.\" Rosenstiehl, VApocalypse d'Elie, p. 95, has a long footnote attempting to pin down the significance of \"the fourth year.\" He calls attention to the three and one half years in Dan 7:25; Lk 4:25; Jas 5:17; Rev 11:3; 12:14; 13:5. But all of those refer to times of suffering for the saints in contrast to the three and one half years of bounty in our text. He then calls attention to the period of forty years in the Tiburtine Sibyl, but he comes to no firm conclusion. b. \"The son of lawlessness\" is lacking from the Chester Beatty Papyrus. c. The Cop. probably translates an ego eimi statement. Cf. Mt 24:5 and the synoptic parallels. This boast of the Messiah is also present in Heb. versions of the Antichrist legend. Cf. Jellinek, Bet ha-Midrash, vol. 2, p. 56 ('ny hw' msyh) and vol. 4, p. 124 ('ny msyhkm). d. Reading pisteue (a)raf e. Cf. Mt 3:16 and the gospel parallels. Cf. also Mt 10:16 and 12:39 since the name Jonah means \"dove.\" The translation \"covey of doves\" is sup­ported by the Chester Beatty Papyrus, which I would restore to read nnoumeh[ou]al ngrompe. The word mehoual is listed by Crum, Coptic Dictionary, p. 208a, as meaning \"nest, dovecot,\" but just as the word ohe means both \"sheepfold\" and \"flock\" the word for \"nest\" or \"dovecot\" may be extended to mean \"covey\" or \"flock.\" The Akhmimic word that is translated \"covey\" is samnt. Crum, Coptic Dictionary, p. 339b, listed its meaning as \"col­lecting place.\" It is also used of small bodies of water. I would suggest a semantic evaluation similar to that which occurred in the mah, \"nest, brood.\" In Middle Egyptian the hieroglyphic determinative for mh is the picture of three ducklings in a pool. The duck pond is conceived of as a \"brooding place.\" That expression may then be used for other \"brooding places\" and applied to other species of birds. f. The Chester Beatty Papyrus reads \"his crown.\" g. Mt 24:30 speaks of the \"sign of the son of man\" appearing before him. W. Bousset in The Antichrist Legend, trans. A. H. Keane (London, 1896) pp. 232-36, traced the various apocalyptic descriptions of the sign of the son of man, partic­ularly the sign of the cross. h. The Chester Beatty Papyrus reads \"the Christ.\" i.

The passage that follows is probably not poetry in the strict sense, but we have printed it in this form to call attention to the considerable amount of parallelism. m.

This sentence is lacking in the Chester Beatty Papyrus. The two preceding sentences lack the phrase \"he will say.\" The order is also reversed. The text reads: \"darken, and it will; shine, and it will.\" o. The Sahidic text published by Steindorff, Die Apokalypse des Elias, resumes its parallel at this point. That text has a difficult reading, which trans­lates as follows: \"saying, 'walk upon the dry land,' and you will walk upon the sea and the rivers as upon the dry land.\" The Chester Beatty Papyrus reads \"and he will say 'walk upon the sea and the rivers as upon the dry land.' \" p. Reading Soudou at Steindorffs suggestion in Die Apokalypse des Elias, p. 88. The scribe wrote SouSou. q. The following list of miracles parallels Mt 11:5. Cf. TAdam 3:1. r. When the author grants the Antichrist power to cast out demons, one is reminded of Jesus' statement concerning a house divided against itself, Mt 12:24-27. s. The Sahidic text edited by Steindorff, Die Apokalypse des Elias, reads \"which the Christ is going to do.\" The Chester Beatty Papyrus reads chrestos in place of Christos. Cf. Jn 2:11; 2:23; 3:2. In 4:31 below the writer speaks of the Antichrist as doing \"every power which the prophets did.\" t. In the apocalyptic texts mustered by Bousset in The Antichrist Legend, pp. 176-81, there is a disagreement over the ability of the Antichrist to raise the dead. Some texts include that among his abilities as a sign of his power, but others explicitly deny it. u. The Sahidic text edited by Steindorff, Die Apokalypse des Elias, lacks the word \"for.\" v. See Bousset, The Antichrist Legend, p. 156, for examples of \"The Antichrist in the Character of a Monster.\" Bousset calls attention to the \"original Jewish character\" of our apocalypse at this point. Rosenstiehl has collected all of the rel­evant descriptions together in \"Le Portrait de Tantichrist,\" which appears in Pseudepigraphes de Vancien testament et manuscrits de la mer mort (Paris, 1967) vol. 1, .pp. 45-63."},{"pageNumber":799,"pageContent":"... of a skinny-legged young lad,w having a tuft of gray hair* at the front of his baldy head.

The translation of this section is difficult and uncertain. The texts read as follows: Akhmimic, oupelei nouSem pe nbr-Sire nSam-ouerete; Sahidic (text published by Steindorff, Die Apokalypse des Elias), oupelek noukouei pe nsa-laSeie nSamaretf; the Chester Beatty Papyrus, oupeled nou[koui pe nsalaSeie] nSamaratf. The first word in the Akhmimic text, petti (=pelik), is unknown, but it is probably a noun. Rosenstiehl, L'Apocalypse d'Elie, p. 98, tran­scribed the word as Peleg and treated it as a title for Hyrcanus II which was concealed in the Qumran references to pig. That thesis is a bit too speculative for us to follow. Although it must be admitted that if he was correct in interpreting the word4 'division\" in 2:40 as a translation of the Heb. pig his argument would be strengthened. It is clever to say the least. Both references to the appearance of the Antichrist (2:40 and the present passage) contain a reference to Peleg according to his view. The second word in the description of the An­tichrist is a familiar word meaning4 4small, young.'' The Akhmimic Sim and the Sahidic kouei are syn­onyms. They normally precede the noun that they modify. Cf. W. Till's Koptische Grammatik (Leipzig, 19612) p. 69. The last word in the Akhmimic phrase given above is Sam-ouerete. The Sahidic Samaretf Samaratf is apparently a synonym. The words are written without an article and should normally be translated as an attribute of the preceding noun. The word Samouerite is a compound expression composed of the word Sma, 44thin, light, subtle,\" and ouerete, 44foot, leg.\" Fortunately, we have a close Heb. parallel for this Cop. phrase. In the HebApEl (in Bet ha-Midrash, vol. 3, p. 65) we read that Swqyw dqym, 4'his legs are thin.\" The word dq, 44thin, light, subtle,\" is the precise equivalent of the Cop. Sma. The noun which is modified by both \"thin-legged\" and \"young\" is not the same in Akhmimic and in Sahidic. In Akhmimic the word is frr-Sire, \"little servant, lad.\" When it is modified by the two attributives the phrase reads \"a skinny-legged young lad.\" Rosenstiehl's translation (in L'Apocalypse d'Elie) of the complete phrase as \"a little Peleg, young, with slender legs,\" assumes a less orthodox syntax on the part of the writer. The noun in Sahidic is sa-laSeie. I know of no reason to ignore Crum's interpretation of this word as \"tall,\" perhaps more lit. 4'grotesquely tall man.\" Compare the Ar. gloss indicating a \"mon­strous form\" (Cram, Coptic Dictionary, pp. 333a and 148a). Thus the Sahidic text reads \"a skinny-legged young grotesquely tall man.\" A mention of great height (sometimes ten or twelve cubits) is a frequent characteristic of descriptions of the An­tichrist. Cf. Rosenstiehl, Pseudepigraphes, p. 54. x. The mark of Cain (?), Gen 4:15. The An­tichrist cannot change this sign. See 3:17 below. y. The Akhmimic word is Satmehel, and the Sahidic word is ialoubih. Both forms of the word were discussed by Von Lemm, Bulletin de I'academie imperiale. z. The Chester Beatty Papyrus has bouhe, which Cram (Coptic Dictionary, p. 48a) lists as meaning *'eyelid.\" W. Westendorff, Koptisches Hand-worterbuch (Heidelberg, 1977) pp. 30, 496, has added the meaning \"Wimper.\" It seems clear from its use in the present context that the meaning ''eyebrow\" should also be added. a2. The Sahidic text reads \"He will change him­self in your presence.\" b2. The Sahidic text published by Steindorff (Die Apokalypse des Elias) reads \"Sometimes he will become old, but other times [reading hinkesop for hinkeop] he will become young again.\" The Chester Beatty Papyrus reads \"Sometimes he will become old but sometimes he will become young again.\" An interesting theophany of Christ as a child and as an old man is found at the beginning of the Apocryphon of John from Nag Hammadi. c2. The Sahidic text published by Steindorff (Die Apokalypse des Elias) reads \"in his signs.\" d2. The Sahidic text reads \"he will not be able to change.\" Although they may be translated in the same way, the Sahidic text published by Steindorff and the Chester Beatty Papyrus use different forms to express the future tense. The former uses a negative first future and the latter uses a negative third future. 4 a. This is apparently the woman from Joppa, who was also known as Dorcas (Acts 9:36). Peter raised her from the dead. That would suggest that this martyr tale, which is closely parallel to those that follow, was the work of a Christian editor of a later time who may have sought to preserve an etiological detail about the healing blood of Tabitha by writing her story into a martyr tale that paralleled those that follow. b. The Sahidic text published by Steindorff (Die Apokalypse des Elias) reads \"The one who is shamed appeared.\" c. The Sahidic text published by Steindorff (Die Apokalypse des Elias) reads \"in the holy place.\" d. Lit.4 'run after him up to Judea.'' The Sahidic text reads 4'and she will run up to Judea.\" e.

This phrase is the same one that is used by Enoch and Elijah in 4:15. h. The Antichrist's hostility to all the saints, which Tabitha condemns here, is described in some detail in 4:20-29 below. The Akhmimic text breaks off at this point. There is a single sheet (two pages) of Akhmimic text missing, but the Sahidic text continues uninter­rupted and preserves a complete text until the Akh­mimic text is resumed. i. Rosenstiehl, L Apocalypse d'Elie, p. 100, notes that Tabitha came from Joppa, in the extreme west with respect to Jerusalem. j. The Cop. word oujai can also be translated \"a salvation.\" k. A similar statement is made by Elijah and Enoch at 4:15 below. 1. The reading at the beginning of this sentence is provided by the Chester Beatty Papyrus. The Sahidic text published by Steindorff (Die Apoka­lypse des Elias) reads simply \"Even my blood you have cast.\" m. The expectation that Elijah would return be­fore the coming of the Messiah is based on Mai 4:5. The assumption that Enoch would return before the day of judgment is based on lEn 90:31, a part of the Book of Dreams. Bousset, The Antichrist Legend, pp. 203-8, assembled a large number of Christian texts dealing with the return of Elijah and Enoch. Although one assumes that the two wit­nesses in Rev 11 were probably intended by the author to represent Moses and Elijah, the Christian exegetes began to interpret them as Elijah and Enoch at a very early date, i.e. from the time of Irenaeus andHippolytus (cf. Bousset, The Antichrist Legend, p. 27). n. The Chester Beatty Papyrus reads \"holy places.\" o. The passage that follows has several poetic features in addition to the obvious parallelism in 11. 4f., 6f., 9f. The last three lines are parallel to the first three lines, providing an enclosure. In 1. 2 there is a contrast between the Antichrist's attempt to attach himself to the saints and his standing firmly against God in 1. 11. Within the poem the writer identifies the one who would attach himself to the saints as a devil. The poem has a symmetrical structure when the lines are grouped together in a sequence of three lines (1-3), two lines (4f.), three lines (6-8), two lines (9f.), three lines (11-13). When it is read this way the first grouf> of three lines ends with the phrase \"you are always es­tranged.\" The second group of three lines ends with the phrase \"you are always a stranger,\" and the last group ends with \"you are a devil.\" p. Not necessarily a question. It could be read \"you are indeed not ashamed.\" q. Reading enetouaab for nenetouaab. Cf. the Sahidic text edited by Steindorff (Die Apokalypse des Elias)!.22. This line is lacking from the Chester Beatty Papyrus. r. The Chester Beatty Papyrus reads' 'those who are upon the earth.\" s. In the third ch. of the TLevi, the author de­scribes various ranks of angels, including a group described as \"thrones.\" Cf. 2En 20:1; Col 1:16; Rev 4:4. At 1:lOf- the \"thrones\" were conceived of as being potentially hostile to men. Here they are apparently good angels who deserve the respect of the shameless one. t. The Chester Beatty Papyrus has a slightly different reading for the last two lines, i.e. \"you have been hostile to the angels and the thrones.\" u. Cf. Job 38:7; Isa 14:12.

The reading \"your tribe\" is found in the Chester Beatty Papyrus. The Sahidic text published by Steindorff (Die Apokalypse des Elias) reads simply \"tribe.\" The noun in both cases is the Gk. word phyle. The meaning of the sentence is not obvious. w. The great city is undoubtedly Jerusalem, but Rosenstiehl, L'Apocalypse d'Elie, p. 43, notes that the epithet is frequently a pejorative expression based upon Jonah's use of the term for Nine van. Although the term is used of Jerusalem in SibOr 5:154, 226, 413 and Jer 22:8, it is more frequently applied to the metropolis of a detested enemy. The use of the expression in Rev is a case in point. The author of that work always uses the term to refer to Rome, except in Rev 11:8 where it is used to describe the city in which the Lord was crucified. There are numerous parallels between the present passage and Rev 11:7-11 which presume a de­pendence on either the present text of Rev or one of its sources. x.

The heavens and the earth (Isa 1:2), the mountains and the founda­tions of the earth (Micah 6:2), who were original witnesses to the covenant, were called again to witness the lawsuit for breach of contract.

The Sahidic text ends at this point with the reading \"on [that] day.\" x2. Rosenstiehl, L'Apocalypse d'Elie, p. 113, has provided a very long list of citations that de­scribe the Messiah as Son of God or portray him as presiding over the judgment.

Normally when a compound subject is desired, one subject is set before the verb and the second is joined after it. The reconstruction of diabolos with an adjective is not entirely satisfac­tory, but it is more idiomatic than the attempt to reconstruct a compound subject at this point.

ZERVOS In its present form the Apocalypse of Daniel1 is a comparatively late Byzantine apocalypse in which earlier traditions concerning the coming of the Antichrist and the end of the world are adapted to the particular historical situation of eighth-century Byzantium. Accordingly, the text may be divided into two major heterogeneous sections, the first of which (chs. 1-7) is based upon the historical events of the Byzantino-Arab wars of the eighth century and their aftermath leading up to the coronation of Charlemagne in Rome in A.D. 800, all of which the author relates in a cryptic manner and projects into the future as prophecies. The narrative leaves the historical sphere and enters the realm of apocalyptic with the beginning of the second major section (chs. 8-14) in which the author draws upon earlier traditions and sources and presents his own version of the end of the world as a direct continuation of the series of historical events described in chapters 1-7. The events of the last years of the world, which in this section also are recounted in the future tense as prophecies, are dominated by the figure of the Antichrist. Described in some detail are the origin and personal characteristics of the Antichrist as well as his rise to power as king and messiah of the Jewish nation, which has been previously restored in Judea. His brief reign—characterized by the deterioration of nature, the persecution of Christians, an unsuccessful attempt at a miracle, and confrontations first with a dragon and then with three holy men—is brought to an abrupt end by the coming of the day of judgment and the appearance of Christ. Texts The text of the Apocalypse of Daniel is preserved complete in each of two manuscripts and partially—and in a much freer rendering—in a third. The complete texts are found in a fifteenth- or sixteenth-century manuscript (MS M) in the School of Medicine at Montpellier, France (Nr. 405, fols. 105r-15), and in a fifteenth-century manuscript (MS B) in the Bodleian Library at Oxford (Codex Canonicianus Nr. 19, fols. 145-52). The partial text (MS V) is in the Bibliotheca Marciana in Venice (Marc. Grec. VII 22, fols. 14-16).2 The present translation is derived from photographs of manuscript B. This manuscript was published by V. Istrin in Otkrovenie Mefodie Patarskago i Apokrificheskie Vidienie Daniila (Moscow, 1897) pp. 145-50; but a reexamination of the photographs revealed numerous errors in Istrin's edition, which reappeared recently in K. Berger's Die griechische Daniel-Diegese.3 Manuscript B is an extremely corrupt text with misspelled words in almost every line. The 1 This particular apocalypse should not be confused with numerous other medieval works associated with the names of Daniel and Methodius. These are catalogued briefly by A.-M. Denis in \"Les Apocalypses de Daniel,\" Introduction, pp. 309-14. 2 MSS M and B were studied by photographs, V by reference to K. Berger, Die griechische Daniel-Diegese, pp. 8-11.1 would like to express my appreciation to the Bodleian Library at Oxford and the School of Medicine at Montpellier for excellent photographs of these MSS, and to the International Center for the Study of Christian Origins at Duke University for access to them. 3 Berger, Daniel-Diegese, pp. 12-23."},{"pageNumber":809,"pageContent":"majority of these misspellings are obviously due to the confusion of the scribe over various groups of Greek letters and diphthongs that during the course of the development of the language have come to be pronounced identically.4 Most of these misspellings or itacisms were corrected by Istrin and will receive no comment in the critical notes of the present translation. Other misspellings, omissions of words and phrases, and mistaken transcriptions by Istrin will be noted. Original language There is no apparent reason why the original language of the Apocalypse of Daniel should be considered to be other than Greek. This assertion is supported by the use of the Greek Septuagint text for Old Testament quotations (4:14; 5:12; 11:11; 14:12) and for Semitic proper names (Hagar in l:2f.; Ishmael in 1:4), as well as for the reference to the \"flinty rock\" in 13:8 (cf. Deut 8:15). The case for Semitic sources for parts of the apocalyptic section (chs. 8-14) would have to be built on such slight evidence as the occurrence of the odd Semitic place-name Gouzeth5 (9:7), which may be contrasted with the easily identifiable Greek place-names in chapter 1, and the Semitism \"sons of men\" (14:5). This phrase, although unique in this document, could still be explained as the influence of the Septuagint or possibly even of the New Testament. Of interest also within this context is the confusion of the manuscripts over the three letters on the forehead of the Antichrist (9:25). While manuscripts M and V have readings that are easily understandable in Greek, manuscript B has the letters A K T; the scribe is obviously hard-pressed to explain their significance.6 This could suggest that this manuscript has preserved the original letters from an earlier source. It is not inconceivable that this source was written in a different, possibly Semitic, language, thus explaining an almost ridiculous attempt to elucidate the meaning in Greek of three letters transliterated from such a language as Aramaic or Syriac.7 However, for lack of more conclusive evidence, the most that can be said is only that these three examples—Gouzeth in 9:7, \"sons of men\" in 14:5, and the three letters on the forehead of the Antichrist in manuscript B (9:25)—could conceivably be faint traces of an earlier, possibly Semitic, source or sources that underlie the whole or parts of the apocalyptic section of the Apocalypse of Daniel. Date The date of the present form of our apocalypse can be determined with some precision by identifying the last historical event to which it makes reference. This appears to be the transfer of the kingdom from Constantinople to Rome (7:14), which may with reasonable certainty be interpreted as an allusion to the coronation of Charlemagne as emperor in Rome on Christmas Day, A.D. 800. This interpretation is supported by the description of the last Byzantine ruler before this event took place as a woman (6:1 Of.), who corresponds to the historical figure of the Empress Irene, sole ruler of Byzantium from 797 to 802. It may therefore be concluded that the Apocalypse of Daniel was in all probability written between the early months of 801, allowing time for the news of Charlemagne's coronation to reach Byzantium, and the end of Irene's reign on October 31, 802.8 The determination of the date of any possible earlier traditions and sources of the apocalyptic section would be extremely difficult and would have to depend on the identification of passages of the present apocalypse with those found in known earlier works. As will be seen below, the Apocalypse of Daniel, and especially its apocalyptic section, contains elements parallel to such early documents as the Sibylline Oracles (books 3-5, 2nd cent. B.C. to 2nd cent, A.D.), 2 Baruch, 4 Ezra, and the Revelation of John (all late 1st cent. A.D.). 4 These itacisms indicate that the scribe who copied MS B did so while hearing the original text being read orally. 5 See n. 12. 6 See ch.9, n. d2. 7 Aram. *khth is mentioned as a root associated with the meaning \"venomous\" or \"vindictive\" in M. Jastrow's A Dictionary of the Targumim, the Talmud Babli and Yerushalmi, and the Midrashic Literature (New York, 1903) vol. 1, p. 66. In Syriac *chth' is a noun form meaning \"wrath\" or \"lasting anger.\" Both of these Semitic words could apply as characteristics of the Antichrist. 8 Cf. Berger, Daniel-Diegese, pp. 36f."},{"pageNumber":810,"pageContent":"Furthermore, our apocalypse describes the conception of the Antichrist by a virgin who touches the head of a small fish into which the Antichrist has previously entered (ch. 9). This account resembles a cryptic Christian inscription of the late second century on the tomb of Aberkios of Hierapolis,9 which depicts Christ as a fish that has been caught by a pure virgin. This parallel, in addition to those with the early pseudepigraphical works mentioned above, could indicate that the author of the Apocalypse of Daniel was familiar with early traditions and incorporated some of them into his own work. It may be concluded, therefore, that the original date of certain elements of this apocalypse could be centuries earlier than that of the document as a whole and that some of them could fit into the apocalyptic environment that produced such works as the Sibylline Oracles, 2 Baruch, 4 Ezra, and the Revelation of John. Provenance Berger's suggestion of a provenance in the Greek islands rather than in Byzantium itself, because of what he describes as the considerable role which the former play in the manuscripts of the apocalypse,10 does not seem to be well founded. The word nesos (island) occurs only twice each in manuscripts M (2:15; 5:9) and V (vss. 34, 36)11 and three times in manuscript B (5:9; 11:8 twice). Such a paucity of references to the term \"island\" within the document could hardly warrant the conclusion of a provenance in the Greek islands. Even these few instances could perhaps be explained more satisfactorily as an example of the dependence of the Apocalypse of Daniel on the imagery of the Revelation of John (see \"Relation to Canonical Books\"), in which islands are mentioned three times (Rev 1:9; 6:14; 16:20). Rather, the overwhelming concern of the apocalypse for the city of Constantinople, at least throughout the historical section, suggests that the \"mother of cities\" (7:11), Constantinople itself, is the place of origin. The change in the overall character of the Apocalypse of Daniel in proceeding from the historical to the apocalyptic section is also apparent in the corresponding geographical shift from Greek Byzantium to Hebrew Judea. This probably reflects the distinctive provenance of the supposed earlier sources of the apocalyptic section, but to determine this provenance with any degree of certainty would be most difficult. Aside from the references to Judea (8:1) and Jerusalem (8:5; 9:14), the only other geographical clue is the place-name Gouzeth (9:7), which Berger explains as the transcription of Kush, the Semitic name for Ethiopia. He concludes, however, that it is more satisfactorily identified as Egypt by a literary parallel occurring in another Christian apocalyptic work.12 At any rate, on the basis of such meager information the most that can be said is that the provenance of the hypothetical sources of the apocalyptic section is perhaps in a Semitic rather than a Greek environment; Palestine and possibly Egypt are suggested by references in the text. Historical importance In its present form, the Apocalypse of Daniel has significance mainly within the context of late eighth-century Byzantine history. The author describes three Byzantine rulers, the first very favorably and the last two in a derogatory manner. The first emperor, as described in chapters 3-5, has characteristics of both Leo III (717-41) and his son Constantine V (741-75); but he is probably to be identified with the latter.13 Both Leo III and Constantine 9 Ibid., pp. 104-6. 10 Ibid., p. 9. 11 Ibid., p. 25. 12 Ibid., p. 106. The place-name Gouze is identified explicitly as the \"land of the Egyptians\" in the Logos tou Kyriou hemon lesou Christou peri tes antilogias tou diabolou, which was published by A. Vassiliev in his Anecdota Graeco-Byzantina, Pars Prior (Moscow, 1893) p. 8. It is perhaps worthy of note that Jastrow identifies Goza as \"a river or channel in Babylon\" (Dictionary, vol. 1, p. 220). 13 Concerning the complicated matter of the divergence of the MSS as to the succession of Byzantine emperors presented in ApDan, see Berger, Daniel-Diegese, pp. 32-39. It seems that the number of years of rule (thirty-four for Constantine V against thirty-six in 5:13 of ApDan), the mention of the two small boys in 3:15; 4:1, 4; 5:2, 18 (see ch. 3, n. r), and the letter \"K\" denoting the name of the emperor in 3:12 (see ch. 3, n. m) would strongly suggest that Constantine V is indeed the savior-king of ApDan, or at least of the version contained in MS B. This is verified by the descriptions of the two rulers who succeed him in ch. 6, who in fact correspond to the two historical successors of Constantine V—Leo IV and Irene."},{"pageNumber":811,"pageContent":"V are notorious in Byzantine history, the former as the initiator and the latter as the most zealous proponent of the iconoclastic movement, which literally shook Byzantium to its very foundations for over a century until it was finally defeated in A.D. 842. On the contrary, the last two rulers, who are described so unfavorably in chapter 6, correspond to Leo IV (775-80) and Irene (797-802 as sole ruler), both of whom in varying degrees opposed the iconoclasts. Irene, in fact, convened the Seventh Ecumenical Synod which met at Nicea in 787 and officially reinstated the veneration of icons and condemned iconoclasm as heresy, acts for which she was later canonized by the Orthodox Church. The extreme favoritism of the author of the Apocalypse of Daniel toward Constantine V and his obvious dislike of Leo IV and Irene perhaps betray his own iconoclastic tendencies. These, however, he never states in this work, possibly out of fear, since he probably wrote during Irene's reign after the decision of the Seventh Ecumenical Synod. Thus, a supporter of iconoclasm, writing at a time when his party was apparently defeated by what must have seemed to him as a heretic empress, could have viewed this development in connection with the rise of a new political power under Charlemagne as the beginning of a series of events that were expected to take place at the end of the world.14 Accordingly, the author drew upon earlier traditions and sources dealing with the last days and composed his own version of what was supposed to follow in the near future. If this hypothesis is correct, it would explain the sudden leap in the story line of the Apocalypse of Daniel from the Byzantine political scene in 801 to the apocalyptic narrative concerning the Antichrist and the last days of the world. Theological importance Since the Apocalypse of Daniel is historically and politically oriented, there is relatively little theological material contained in it. God appears mainly when he intervenes in the political or military history of nations, as for example in chapter 3, in which he determines the outcome of the Byzantino-Arab wars (cf. 6:9 and 7:11); but he is also responsible for the abundance of the fruits of the earth in peacetime (5:16). Man also is shown chiefly in political and military situations; but in the sphere of religion he is divided into two camps according to faith: the Roman Christians and the misbelievers (especially the Arabs and Jews). World history is presented as proceeding toward a final \"judgment and recompense\" (14:14), but exactly what is to follow is not specified beyond a single statement concerning the flowering of Christ as \"Lord and king of glory\" (14:16). There is only one mention of an angel in 3:7, but this verse could be dependent on the imagery contained in chapter 16 of the Revelation of John (see \"Relation to Canonical Books\"). As far as can be ascertained from the description of the sinful rulers in chapter 6 and from the account of liturgical degeneration in chapter 2:5-8, the ethics of the apocalypse seem to be along the traditional lines that would be expected in a medieval Christian work. The most important single theological aspect of the Apocalypse of Daniel—and which significantly seems to belong to the earlier underlying sources—is a relatively complex dualism centering on the figure of the Antichrist,15 who is the leader of the final assault by the forces of evil against the Christians. Jews (ch. 11), demons (ch. 12), and even nature itself (chs. 11:5-11; 12:9-13) take part in this great persecution, while the whole affair is summarily described as \"the deception of the devil\" (14:15). Given in chapter 9 are important details about the origin of the Antichrist as well as a bizarre description of his person. The \"theology\" of the Antichrist as presented in this apocalypse is completed by the addition, in the last two chapters, of the accounts of his unsuccessful attempt at a miracle and his confrontation with three holy men leading up to his final downfall, which coincides with the coming of the day of judgment and the appearance of Christ. 14 For a discussion of the belief that the fall of the Roman Empire, which to our author was the Byzantine Empire, would immediately precede the end of the world, see W. Bousset's The Antichrist Legend, pp. 123-32. 15 Concerning the Antichrist tradition see Bousset, Legend, and more recently H. D. Rauh's Das Bild des Antichrist im Mittelalter: von Tyconius zum deutschen Symbolismus (Beitrage zur Geschichte der Philosophic und Theologie des Mittelalters N.F. 9; Minister, 1979); see especially pp. 145-52."},{"pageNumber":812,"pageContent":"Relation to canonical books Except for such scattered references to biblical books in 1:1 (Mk 13:7, 8, and parallels), 4:14 (Deut 32:30), 5:12 (Isa 2:4), 9:9f. (2Thes 2:3), 11:11 (Prov 11:32), 14:9 (Heb 11:38), and 14:12 (Ps 51:19), the Apocalypse of Daniel seems to be primarily dependent on the imagery and language of the Revelation of John. In fact, the overall framework of this apocalypse is reminiscent of the sixth and seventh bowls of God's wrath described in Revelation 16:12-21 and of the fall of the great harlot Babylon portrayed in chapters 17 and 18. In Revelation 16:12 we find the idea that the Euphrates River will dry up so that the way of the kings of the East may be prepared. Similarly, in the Apocalypse of Daniel 1:2 a bush that restrains the three sons of Hagar also dries up, and according to 1:3 these three figures enter Babylonia, the area around the Euphrates River. In Revelation 16:13-16 three unclean spirits go forth to gather the nations of the world to the great final battle of Armageddon. This brings to mind the three armies led by the three sons of Hagar against Byzantium, where they engage in a great war with the savior-king and his two small boys (chs. 1-4). A significant parallel may be seen at the climax of the attack by the respective forces of evil in each of the narratives in question. In both cases very similar statements occur concerning sounds and voices from heaven and a great earthquake, which seem to signal the turning point in the battle (Rev 16:17f.; ApDan 3:7). Finally, the description of the great harlot Babylon in Revelation (chs. 16-18) is obviously the prototype of the references to Babylon in our apocalypse (7:2, 5, 11). This is verified by similarities even in details such as the seven hills of the city Babylon (Rev 17:9; ApDan 7:2, 5) and the woes pronounced upon this city (Rev 18:10, 16, 19; ApDan 7:2, 5, 11). Aside from the possibility that the historical structure of the Apocalypse of Daniel is dependent on the succession of events described in chapters 16-18 of the Revelation of John, there also seems to have been a certain amount of borrowing of specific images. For example, Revelation 14:20 presents the image of blood as deep as the bridles of horses, and the Apocalypse of Daniel 4:8 portrays horses as being submerged and drowning in blood. According to Revelation 9:6 men will seek death and desire to die, and according to our apocalypse 12:4f. people will be calling on death and will be blessing those who have already died. The drying up of all greenery, trees, and flowers and the description of the earth as being like copper according to the Apocalypse of Daniel 12:9-11 could be a reflection of the burning of one third of the trees and green grass on the earth that is depicted in Revelation 8:7. Finally, a striking parallel image in the two documents is the description in Revelation 6:15f. of the kings of the earth and magnates, among others, hiding themselves in the caves and the rocks of the mountains and calling on the mountains and rocks to fall on them. This seems to be reproduced in the Apocalypse of Daniel at 2:15, where it is written that rulers and magnates will \"flee to the glens of the mountains\" and in 12:6 (MS M only), where it is said that people will entreat and beg the mountains to cover them. Finally, there are a number of parallel phrases and terms in the two works that would support a dependence of the Apocalypse of Daniel on the Book of Revelation. The most outstanding of these are the phrases \"sand of the sea\" used to describe the multitudes of the enemy in our apocalypse at 12:1 (cf. Rev 20:8), and \"foundation of the world\" found in our apocalypse at 4:6; 5:16; and 10:1 (cf. Rev 13:8). The terms \"mountains\" and \"islands\" are used together twice in Revelation (6:14; 16:20), while appearing also together in the present apocalypse at 5:9 and separately at 1:9; 2:15, 17; 11:8; and 14:9. Also of interest are the similes of the mourners of fallen Babylon as sailors in Revelation 18:17-19 and as merchants in 18:3, 11, and 15. Sailors will lament over fallen Babylon according to the Apocalypse of Daniel 7:13, merchants will do likewise according to 7:14 (MS M only). Each of these parallel terms and phrases would seem insignificant alone. However, when viewed together and in connection with the previously discussed similarities of historical structure and imagery, they strongly indicate a dependence of the Apocalypse of Daniel on the Revelation of John. Relation to apocryphal books The Apocalypse of Daniel is only one of a considerable number of similar apocalypses"},{"pageNumber":813,"pageContent":"that are strangely reminiscent of the early Jewish pseudepigraphical works.16 That the Apocalypse of Daniel either influenced or was influenced by one or more of these contemporary documents cannot be doubted, as this is evidenced by several examples of direct dependence.17 It is beyond the scope of this introduction, however, to examine this matter in more detail. The most that will be done will be to point out some of the most significant parallels between this apocalypse and some early pseudepigrapha. The reference to the king of the Romans by the initial letter of his name (ApDan 3:12) could stem from Sibylline Oracles 5.1-51, in which most of the Roman emperors from Julius Caesar to Marcus Aurelius are identified by the numerical value of the first Greek letter of their names. It is perhaps significant that among the names of these emperors, Caesar and Claudius begin in Greek with the letter K, which has the numerical value twenty, as is the case with the Roman king mentioned in the Apocalypse of Daniel 3:12. It should be noted that this apocalypse follows the motif of the Sibylline Oracles as opposed to that used in the Revelation of John 13:18, in which the figure represented by the second beast is identified by the number 666, the sum of the numerical values of all the letters of his name. In view of the probable dependence of this apocalypse on Revelation, as discussed in the preceding section, the method for denoting emperors could indicate that this particular element is borrowed from another source, possibly the Sibylline Oracles. Another concept of the Sibylline Oracles worthy of note in relation to the Apocalypse of Daniel is that found in Book 3.75-77, in which a woman is described as the last ruler before the end of the world. This idea accords with 6: lOf. of our apocalypse, which also presents a woman as the last ruler of the \"Seven-hilled\" city in an eschatological context (cf. Rev 17). The similarity between the two texts is strengthened by the appearance in both of a malevolent figure who will deceive people, especially the Jews. In Sibylline Oracles 3.63-69 the deceiver is Beliar, or Satan, and in our apocalypse the later chapters are concerned with the Antichrist, who will deceive the Jews into worshiping him as the Messiah. A final motif of the Sibylline Oracles present also in the Apocalypse of Daniel is that expressed in 3:10 and concerns the savior-king of the Romans, \"who people say is dead and useful for nothing, who people think died many years before.\" This is apparently a reference to the early Nero redivivus legend, which found its way repeatedly into the Sibylline Oracles (e.g. 4.119, 138f.; 5.33L, 101-7, 137-54) and is implied in Revelation 13:3. The essential difference between the use of this motif in the Sibylline Oracles and Revelation on the one hand and in the Apocalypse of Daniel on the other is that in the former two works it refers to the monstrous figure of Nero as an enemy of the people of God, and in the present apocalypse it is applied to the savior-king sent by God. Chapter 10 of the Apocalypse of Daniel contains an interesting description of the fruitfulness of the earth just prior to the rise to power of the Antichrist. The phraseology in 10:3f. includes vine branches, grape clusters, and individual grapes; this cluster of images is strongly reminiscent of what R. H. Charles referred to as a \"fragment of an old Apocalypse\"18 recorded in 1 Enoch 10:19, 2 Baruch 29:5, and later by Papias through a quotation preserved in Irenaeus, Contra kaereses 5.33.3. Exactly which of these documents was the source of the parallel passage in our apocalypse cannot be determined with certainty. However, the occurrence of such a passage serves to demonstrate that the author of the Apocalypse of Daniel did at least take into consideration much earlier sources and in this particular case interpolated, although not without modification, early apocalyptic material into his own work. Another possible case of the insertion of foreign material into the Apocalypse of Daniel may perhaps be seen in chapter 13, which concerns an unsuccessful attempt by the Antichrist to turn a stone into bread in the presence of his Jewish worshipers. There appear to be elements from another tradition interwoven into the fabric of this chapter. This is indicated lb See n. 1. Berger gives an extensive list of 188 apocryphal works, both early and medieval, in pp. xi-xxiii of Daniel-Diegese. 17 Aside from the aforementioned parallel in the document published by Vassiliev, Anecdota Graeco-Byzantina, p. 8, there are also strong literary affinities between ApDan and the so-called \"Apocalypse of John\" published by C. Tischendorf in his Apocalypses Apocryphae Mosis, Esdrae, Pauli, lohannis, item Mariae Dormitio (Leipzig, 1866) pp. 73-76. Berger (Daniel-Diegese) deals extensively with the matter of parallels between ApDan and other—especially medieval—apocryphal works in his commentary on the text of the Apocalypse of Daniel. 18 APOT, vol. 2, p. 497."},{"pageNumber":814,"pageContent":"by the use of two different Greek words—lithos (stone) in verses 1 and 2, and petra (rock) in verses 8 and 10—to describe the stone. Furthermore, the verses in which the term petra is located (vss. 8-13) stand apart from the rest of chapter 13 and from the apocalypse as a whole in two significant ways. First, these verses are written as a block in the present tense as opposed to the rest of the document, which, except for a very few scattered instances, is in the future tense.19 Secondly, verses 8-13 relate a series of events that are theologically incompatible with the Book of Revelation, which has been shown to be a major source of the imagery in our apocalypse. Verses 8-13 describe the Antichrist commanding a \"flinty rock\" to become bread in order to impress the Jews. Instead, the rock becomes a dragon and reviles him as iniquitous and unjust, thus shaming him before the Jews. This picture of a dragon as an enemy of the Antichrist is contrary to the portrayal of the dragon (Satan) in Revelation 13:2, 4, 11; and 16:13 as an ally of the two bestial Antichrist figures described in Revelation 13. The linguistic evidence of the two different Greek words for the stone used in the two sections of chapter 13, the grammatical peculiarity of the second section being in the present tense, and the theological incompatibility of this section with the main source of the imagery of the apocalypse as a whole, the Book of Revelation, would indicate that verses 8-13 of chapter 13 of the Apocalypse of Daniel are based on material originating from another source. The closest parallel to the imagery presented in these verses may be found in 4 Ezra 5:5, in which a stone is also said to \"utter its voice\" within an eschatological context closely resembling the woeful times preceding the end of the world as presented in the last chapters of the Apocalypse of Daniel.20 Finally, and of particular interest in connection with the relation of the Apocalypse of Daniel to other apocryphal works, is the suggestion made by W. Bousset21 concerning the existence of a now lost apocalypse dealing with the Antichrist, which was entitled, according to Bousset, the Apocalypse of Daniel. Even more interesting is the possibility raised by Bousset22 that this lost apocalypse was used as a source by the third-century Christian Father Hippolytus, thus bringing the date of this hypothetical document to a period approaching that of the early pseudepigrapha. An investigation of the possibility of the existence of such a document and its relation to the other medieval apocalypses would perhaps clear up many of the questions concerning the sources of the apocalyptic material preserved in the Apocalypse of Daniel. Cultural importance The present Apocalypse of Daniel was until very recently accessible only through the manuscripts themselves or through Istrin's rare edition of 1897, and then only to those with a knowledge of Greek. Berger's publication in 1976 made it available in German, while the present translation is the first appearance of this document in English. Under such circum­stances the Apocalypse of Daniel can hardly be said to have exercised any significant influence on our culture. However, certain concepts embodied in this and similar Byzantine works, although originally intended for one specific period of history, have lived on through the popular beliefs and aspirations of those nations that have inherited the Byzantine spiritual tradition. As the centuries passed, the Turks replaced the Arabs as the \"sons of Hagar\" and the \"Ishmaelites\" and became the relentless enemies of the Orthodox nations of the Balkans and eastern Europe. The Ottoman Empire eventually enveloped all these peoples, except the Russians, and took the \"Seven-hilled\" city of Constantinople in 1453. The subsequent decline of the Turkish Empire was paralleled by the emergence of Russia as a world power and later by the establishment of such independent and restive Balkan states as Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia, and Romania. Thus was created a political situation reminiscent of eighth-century Byzantium, with free Orthodox nations again in conflict with the \"sons of Hagar.\" A new significance was acquired by the old Byzantine apocalypses that told of a Roman 19 Seech. 13, n. j. 20 Cf. 4Bar 9:30. 21 Bousset, Legend, pp. 68-72, 160. 22 Ibid., pp. 82f."},{"pageNumber":815,"pageContent":"king named Constantine who would defeat the Ishmaelites and drive them away from the \"Seven-hilled\" city. This concept was especially tantalizing to the Russians, who considered themselves to be the inheritors of the Roman sovereignty after the fall of the Byzantine Empire. The Russian rulers were called czars after the Caesars and Moscow was the Third Rome—after classical Rome and the New Rome, which was the official title of Constantinople. The centuries-long struggle of Russia to gain strategic access to the Mediterranean Sea also took on the nature of a holy war to liberate the old Byzantine imperial city of Constantinople, which happened to sit astride the Bosporus, the natural gateway from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean. Catherine the Great went so far as to christen her second grandson Constantine in 1779 as part of a plan to drive the Turks out of the Balkans and Asia Minor and to reestablish the Byzantine Empire with her grandson as its ruler in Constantinople. The Romanov dynasty also pursued an aggressive foreign policy against the Turks throughout the nineteenth century. This culminated in World War I with the secret treaty of the Allies awarding Constantinople to Russia after victory. The Russian Revolution of 1917 intervened, however, and Russia withdrew from the war, thus losing by a matter of months the prize it had sought through centuries of wars and struggles. At any rate, this interest of the Russians in medieval apocalyptic traditions explains the appearance in the late nineteenth century of collections of Byzantine apocalypses in Russian editions, such as that of Istrin and the Anecdota Graeco-Byzantina of A. Vassiliev, which appeared in Moscow in 1893. The influence of medieval apocalyptic traditions may also be seen in the case of modern Greece. The Greeks were the first of the Balkan peoples to achieve their independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1830 and have added traditional Greek territories to their state roughly every generation since that time at the expense of the ever-dwindling Turkish Empire. The old prophecies concerning a king named Constantine who would drive the Turks from Constantinople seemed to be coming true in the early 1920s when indeed King Constantine XII (twelfth in line from Constantine the Great) ruled Greece at a time when a Greek army of occupation had landed in Asia Minor and was moving eastward. Although the expedition failed and the Greeks were driven out of Asia Minor, there can be little doubt that the ancient popular traditions had played a not inconsiderable role in the formulation of the Greek war plans. Even today the belief is widespread among the Greek people, as the only remaining free Orthodox nation, that someday a Constantine will accomplish the reconquest of the \"Queen of cities,\" which has until now eluded their grasp. The examples of Russia and Greece serve to demonstrate how Byzantine apocalyptic traditions, if not such works themselves as the Apocalypse of Daniel, have significantly influenced major historical events throughout the centuries and continue to have the potential to do so.

The first part of this quotation is an exact rendering from Mk 13:7f., while the latter part seems to reflect the concern with heavenly signs in the parallel passage in Lk 21: lOf. h. Hagar was the maidservant of Sarah who gave birth to Ishmael by Abraham (Gen 16). Hence, the Byzantines commonly referred to the Arabs and later to the Turks, whom they thought to be the descendants of Hagar and Ishmael, as Agarenes and Ishmaelites. i. M: \"And the nations and the three sons of Hagar will go forth from great Babylonia,\" but it may also be translated: \"And the nations of great Babylonia and the three sons of Hagar will go forth.\" j. As supported by the reading of this name as Oualleis in M, this is probably a reference to the Arab Caliph Walid I who ruled early in the 8th cent. See Berger, Daniel-Diegese, pp. 47-49, for a discussion of the identities of the three sons of Hagar mentioned by name in this verse. k. Istrin corrects the corrupt reading ho hete in B to ho heteros (lit. \"the other\"). 1. Istrin corrects the corrupt reading kato mews in B to katelthe to mews. This is supported by M. m. The three individuals vaguely referred to in B as \"the other one,\" \"another,\" and \"the third one\" are more clearly identified in M as the afore­mentioned three sons of Hagar. n. Read Smyrnen for Smirnin in B. Istrin has Smirnen. o. The \"Seven-hilled\" city which will be men­tioned many times in this document is Constanti­nople (Byzantium), the capital of the Byzantine Empire, which, like Rome, was built upon seven hills. p. B has kai twice. q. The Byzantines considered themselves to be the successors of the Roman Empire and therefore as a rule referred to themselves as Romans. r. Read haima for haiman in B. s.

The numerical values of the Gk. letters Ch, X, and St also add up to 666. The letters A K 7\\ however, which are preserved in B, obviously puzzled even the scribe of this MS. The A is explained adequately as rep­resenting arnoumai, but the K and T are presented as signifying the conjunction kai (\"and\") and the article ton (\"the\"), which introduce the phrases: \"And I completely reject\" and \"The befouled dragon.\" This ludicrous explanation by the scribe of B indicates that he is dealing with a set of letters foreign to him—possibly from another source—for which he concocts an obviously forced interpreta­tion.

H. CHARLESWORTH The traditions in the Old Testament provided the framework and most of the presuppositions for the following testaments. These documents represent a type of writing that was presaged in the Old Testament (cf. Gen 49), but which did not reach maturity until the time of the second Temple. Just as the Old Testament contains for Jews and Christians a record of God's covenant, testament, and will (nouns represented by one word in Gk., diatheke), so the following compositions reputedly preserve the solemn last words and wills of model figures. No binding genre was employed by the authors of the testaments, but one can discern among them a loose format: The ideal figure faces death and causes his relatives and intimate friends to circle around his bed. He occasionally informs them of his fatal flaw and exhorts them to avoid certain temptations; he typically instructs them regarding the way of right­eousness and utters blessings and curses. Often he illustrates his words—as the apocalyptic seer in the apocalypses—with descriptions of the future as it has been revealed to him in a dream or vision. The latter feature is common to apocalyptic literature and plays a significant role in some of the testaments, especially the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, the Testament of Abraham, and the Testament of Moses. The unique features and peculiarities of some of these documents and the significant differences among them should not be overshadowed by their sharing of the title \"testament.\" Some scholars, for example, have argued that the Testament of Abraham is not a testament because it lacks one of the form's reputed features: Abraham is not portrayed as preparing and giving a testament. It is clear that the testaments do not represent a well-defined genre; moreover, the testamentary framework often includes, for example, apocalyptic, ethical, and Midrashic types of literature. Some works included under \"Expansions of the 'Old Testament' and Other Legends\" have even been called testaments; for example, Jubilees has been denom­inated \"The Testament of Moses.\" Also to be consulted when reading the testaments are the following: the Testament of Hezekiah (in the Martyrdom and Ascension of Isaiah), the Testament of Zosimus (an earlier name for the History of the Rechabites), and the Testament of Orpheus (cf. Orphica in the Supplement).

A NEW TRANSLATION AND INTRODUCTION BY H. C. KEE The Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs purport to be the final utterances of the twelve sons of Jacob, on the model of Jacob's last words in Genesis 49. Just prior to his death, each of the sons is depicted as gathering around him his offspring, reflecting on aspects of his life, confessing his misdeeds, exhorting his family to avoid his sins and exemplify virtue, concluding with predictions about the future of Israel and giving instructions concerning his burial. In the process, each patriarch calls for special honor to be given to Levi and Judah, progenitors, respectively, of the priestly and kingly lines of the nation. The account in each case ends with a report of the burial of the patriarch. Most of the Testaments include a section in which the destiny of the nation is described according to a pattern of the nation's sin, its exile as divine judgment, and its restoration in glory in the eschatological future.1 Texts GREEK 1.

In his edition of the Greek text of the Testaments, R. H. Charles assumed the existence of two ancient recensions of the work, one of which he designated a and the other p. He believed he could trace these two different textual traditions back to two recensions of what he thought to be the original Hebrew of the Testaments. For the most part the differences between the Greek textual traditions were accounted for by Charles as having arisen by chance, based in many cases on corruption in the process of translation. According to Charles, both a and p texts contain Christian interpolations, with a greater number in the 1 My studies in T12P were initiated by my esteemed teachers at Yale, Millar Burrows and Clarence Tucker Craig. More recently I have benefited by way of stimulus, challenge, and criticism from the members of the Pseudepigrapha Seminars of the Society of Biblical Literature and the Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas, especially M. de Jonge and J. H. Charlesworth. John Priest, of Florida State University, read a draft of this material and offered most helpful comments and criticism; Dr. Ellen Young likewise provided perceptive editorial assistance. To all of them I hereby express gratitude, in recognition that I bear responsibility for the results."},{"pageNumber":829,"pageContent":"latter text tradition. Charles based his critical text primarily on the a text, but acknowledged that sometimes one tradition preserves the true text, and at times the other, so that the translator is obliged to move back and forth between a and p. M. de Jonge, on the other hand, based his critical text on the (3 tradition. H. J. de Jonge, in M. de Jonge, Studies on the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, rejects the a/p classification of manuscripts and concludes that only manuscripts b and k (only contains excerpts) have preserved the oldest stage of the Greek archetype. ARMENIAN Nearly all of the twelve manuscripts of the Testaments in Armenian known to R. H. Charles were from western Europe (chiefly in the library of the Mechitarist Fathers in Venice); of these, nine were used by Charles in preparing his critical edition of the text. C. Burchard now lists forty-five manuscripts of the Testaments in Armenian, some of which are now in the Armenian Patriarchate in Jerusalem and which have been published in part by M. Stone in his critical study of the Testament of Levi. Until new evidence from previously unpublished manuscripts shows otherwise, however, the Armenian manuscripts are still to be classified as Aa and Ap, of which Aa is an abbreviated text that includes readings of a secondary nature, although on the whole it stands closer to the a text of the Greek tradition. In addition, it represents several superior readings. The Armenian manuscripts remain translations from the Greek, however, and give no evidence of dependence on Semitic originals. SLAVONIC The Slavonic manuscripts are few and late, consisting mostly of material excerpted from Greek sources in which Old Testament narratives are retold in expanded form. HEBREW Late Hebrew fragments of a Testament of Judah and a complete Testament of Naphtali have long been known, but the Late Hebrew style in which they are written and their divergence in both structure and basic substance from the Greek Testaments exclude them from consideration as being merely late copies of an original Hebrew document that might underlie our Greek Testaments. They present only occasional and fragmentary verbal parallels with the Greek Testaments. An unpublished genealogy of Bilhah from Qumran Cave 4 seems to have an affinity with the Testament of Naphtali 1:6—12, but determination of the relationship must await publication of the text. ARAMAIC The fragments of an Aramaic Testament of Levi, discovered in the Cairo Genizah (a synagogue storeroom) and first published in 1910, have since been supplemented by a somewhat fuller Greek version of this same work found at the Monastery of Koutloumousiou on Mount Athos, and more recently by numerous fragments discovered at Qumran. The latter include possible parallels—their fragmentary nature precludes certainty—to the Tes­tament of Levi 21 and to a Prayer of Levi which is not found in our Greek Testament of Levi but which does appear in the Athos version after Testament of Levi 2:3. All these fragments evidence kinship with the Testaments and at some points with the Jubilees, but the divergences in wording are so great as to exclude the possibility of a direct literary dependence of our Greek Testaments on this Aramaic material. The textual basis for this translation is the critical edition of R. H. Charles, although some readings have been adopted from the p text published by M. de Jonge, usually in the interests of literary coherence or clarity of meaning. In addition, the edition of S. Agourides has been consulted. Where the weight of evidence between the two main text traditions seems to be balanced, or where one offers an interesting variant to the content of the other, both have been printed in parallel columns. Original language The discovery of fragments of testaments in Aramaic that are in some way akin to the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs has led some scholars to conclude that the Greek form"},{"pageNumber":830,"pageContent":"of this work is dependent on a hypothetical Aramaic or Hebrew document that included testaments of all twelve of the patriarchs. The direct links between the Greek version and the Aramaic works are so few, however, and the absence from the Semitic fragments of some of the fundamental concepts of the Testaments presented here is so complete as to rule out an Aramaic original for our Testaments. Charles sought to make a case for Hebrew as the original language of the Testaments on the grounds that (1) Hebrew idiom underlies the Greek text and (2) that awkward turns of speech, puzzling etymologies for personal and place-names, and seemingly unintelligible passages can best be accounted for by reconstructing a Hebrew original. But the Semitic idiom can just as well be explained as deriving from the language and style of the Septuagint in use among Greek-speaking Jews. The evidence adduced for mistranslations from a Semitic original is purely hypothetical and is more than offset by the clear indication that our document is dependent on the Septuagint as Testament of Joseph 20:3 (hippodromos) shows, and by the occurrence of puns on Greek words (e.g. TLevi 6:1). The pervasive use of technical terms of hellenistic piety for which there are no exact counterparts in Hebrew or Aramaic, in addition to the influence of hellenistic romances on the style and scope of the narrative portions of the Testaments, points rather to the conclusion that they were originally written in Greek. There were possibly some additions to the text made by Greek-speaking Jews in the period around the turn of the eras; for example, Testament of Reuben 6:7 and Testament of Levi 18:9 may have been expanded by later Jewish (non-Essene) editors. A large number of passages in the Testaments are messianic, but ten or more of them also sound specifically Christian. Examples of this are Testament of Levi 4:1; 14:2, which speak of laying hands (violently) on the \"Son\" or \"the Savior of the world.\" In Testament of Asher 7:3, God is said to come eating and drinking, as a man. Testament of Benjamin 9:3 depicts the Lord entering \"the first temple,\" after which he is \"raised up on wood.\" Charles designated these passages as Christian interpolations into a basically Jewish document. M. de Jonge, on the other hand, asserted that the whole of the Testaments is Christian: building on Jewish traditions—the testaments of Levi and Naphtali, as well as other testaments which have survived in fragmentary form or in later copies—a Christian author produced the present complete set of twelve testaments around A.D. 200. His theory, however, seems both unwarranted and unnecessary. The existence of the Aramaic fragments of a Testament of Levi and of the fragmentary Hebrew Testament of Naphtali at Qumran, together with the much later Hebrew testaments of Judah and Naphtali, shows that in the testamentary literature linked with the sons of Jacob and produced in the period of the second Temple we are dealing with a broad and free tradition. The genre \"testament\" is itself loosely defined, and its exemplars are transmitted in versions which vary in language and content. As a result of this generic and conceptual fluidity, it is not surprising that there are only very occasional points of verbal contact between the Greek Testaments and the Hebrew and Aramaic testaments. Literary dependence cannot be inferred, much less demonstrated. Rather, we must reckon with an author who, in writing the Testaments, is drawing on a free tradition and creating from it his own distinctive literary product. The peculiarities of the document can be accounted for fully if we assume that it was written originally in Greek, with Hebrew and Aramaic testaments serving loosely as models and perhaps to a very limited extent as sources for details. The Christian interpolations, which number not more than twelve, and which occur in the latter part of those testaments that contain them, are conceptually peripheral to the main thrust of the document and are literarily incongruous, so that they may be readily differentiated from the original Greek text. Date Apart from the Christian interpolations, which seem to have a special affinity with Johannine thought and probably date from the early second century A.D., the basic writing gives no evidence of having been composed by anyone other than a hellenized Jew. Its use of the Septuagint suggests that it was written after 250 B.C., which is the approximate year that the Septuagint translation was completed. Syria is the last world power to be mentioned"},{"pageNumber":831,"pageContent":"in the sketch of successive world empires, and the lack of any unambiguous reference to the Maccabees might suggest a date before that nationalist revolt circa early second century B.C. If, however, the combination of prophetic, priestly, and kingly roles in Testament of Levi 18:2 is taken as a reference to John Hyrcanus (so R. H. Charles), then the Testaments may well have been written during his reign (137-107 B.C.). Others have inferred from some evidences of kinship between the Testaments and the Dead Sea writings that the former is Essene in origin (so M. Philonenko and A. Dupont-Sommer). Certainly the view in the Testaments of a dual messiahship, with an anointed king from Judah and an anointed priest from Levi, parallels the (not always consistent) messianic outlook at Qumran. And since the Qumran community seems to have flourished in the period beginning about 150 B.C., this link could also be taken as evidence pointing to the Maccabean period as the date of origin of the Testaments. Provenance Proponents of the Aramaic origin of the writing look to Palestine as its place of writing, although the marked differences between it and the Dead Sea Scrolls on the essence of obedience to the law rule out Qumran. Champions of a Christian origin for the Testaments have a wide range of options for provenance. The internal evidence, however, could be read as pointing to Egypt, because of the special interest in Joseph (which seems to have flourished among Egyptian Jews) and possibly because of the loose links between the Christian interpolations and Johannine thought, which is at times assigned to Alexandrine Christianity. More likely, however, is a Syrian provenance: It is Syria rather than the Ptolemies of Egypt that appears as the current world power in this writing; the knowledge of Palestinian place-names but the lack of accuracy as to their location may point to a neighboring land such as Syria, while almost certainly ruling out Palestine proper. Historical importance When the ten or twelve Christian interpolations are set aside, the basic document of the Testaments bears witness to the diversity of outlook that developed within Judaism in the period prior to the Maccabean Revolt and flourished throughout the Maccabean period. Secondarily, the Greek text as it has been preserved demonstrates the various ways in which the perspectives represented by this writing were appropriated by Jews and Christians in subsequent centuries. The oldest discernible stage of this writing represents (1) a synthesis of devotion to the Law of Moses and dyarchie messianism (king and priest); incorporated with that synthesis is (2) a piety employing the religious and ethical language and concepts of Hellenism. By the time the testaments were taken over by Christians, they included not only universal precepts of hellenistic ethics but apocalyptic expectations, ascetic exhortations, entertaining embellishments of the biographical sections of the book of Genesis, and a primitive kind of somatic psychology as well. The document demonstrates, therefore, the openness of one of several segments of Judaism during the period of the second Temple to non-Jewish cultural insights and influences, as well as to the inadequacy of the neat division of Jews into the \"three philosophies\" that historians have inherited from Josephus in his Antiquities (13.171-73). Theological importance God. Although God is represented as merciful and gracious (TIss 6:4; TJos 2:1; TJud 23:5), his qualities as emphasized in this document are his holiness (TLevi 3:4) and his wrath (TLevi 6:11). He effects judgments in the world (TLevi 4:1; 18:lf.; TJud 22:1; 23:3) and does so with such vengeance that the patriarchs intercede in behalf of others (TReu 1:7; 4:4; 6:6). In the end-time, he will dwell in the midst of Israel (TLevi 5:2; TJud 22:2; TZeb 9:8; TNaph 8:3). Man is portrayed as possessing seven (or eight) spirits (i.e. the senses; TReu 2:2-9); these \"are commingled\" with seven other \"spirits of error\" (TReu 3:3-6). His organs function to influence his behavior by means of a kind of somatic psychology (TSim 2:4; TZeb 2:4;"},{"pageNumber":832,"pageContent":"TGad 5:11; TJos 15:3). Sleep leads him into fantasy and error, as well as to visions of death (TReu 3:1, 7). In contrast to women, men are basically pure in mind (TReu 6:2; see below under Ethics). Cosmology. The universe is ceiled by three heavens, in ascending order: of water, of light, and of God's dwelling place (TLevi 2:7-10). It is essential to preserve natural order (TNaph 3:2-5), since natural law is identical with the Law of God (TNaph 3:4). The present age will end in the consummation of God's purpose (TReu 6:8). Angels. The angels who instruct the righteous (TReu 5:3; TIss 2:1; TJud 15:5) are present in the first heaven, where they also serve as instruments of punishment on the wicked (TLevi 3:2-3). In the second heaven are the spirits of Beliar, and in the third are the archangels of the Lord's presence, who offer to him a bloodless oblation. The angel of peace enables Israel to withstand her enemies (TDan 6:5). In addition to interceding in behalf of Israel (TLevi 5:6), the angels offer special guidance to Levi and Judah (TLevi 5:4). Dualism. Two kinds of spirits are abroad in the world: the spirits of truth and the spirits of error (TJud 20: If.). This has been so since the beginning of time when the Watchers brought a curse on the earth by defying the natural order (TNaph 3:5). The fundamental split now manifests itself in the choice between Two Ways, one guided by the angels of the Lord and the other by the angels of Beliar (TAsh). It is Beliar who instigates human acts of sin (TDan 1:7; 3:6, where he is called Satan; 5:6; TBenj 6:1; 7: If.), especially by taking advantage of human sexual urges (TReu 4:11; 6:3; 7:2). He will carry many off into apostasy in the last days (TIss 6:1), but will be defeated by God's agents of salvation (TDan 6:3; TJos 20:2). Eschatological Agents and Events. Levi and Judah are central figures in the eschatology of the Testaments (TReu 6:8, 11; TSim 7:1; TIss 5:7-8; TJos 19:11; TNaph 5:1-5; 6:7; 8:2) with Judah as king (TJud 1:6; 24:1-6) but with Levi as his superior (TJos 19:4). As God's anointed priest, Levi will be the agent of redemption (TLevi 18:1-11) and will overcome Beliar (TLevi 18:12). After the temple has been destroyed in judgment (TLevi 10:3; 15:1; 16:4-5), it will be rebuilt in the end (TBenj 9:2). In some passages there appears (in addition to Levi and Judah) a unique prophet in the eschatological temple (TBenj 9:2), while in other texts there is a single agent \"from Levi and Judah\" who accomplishes redemption (TDan 5:10; TGad 8:1; TBenj 4:2). Finally, God himself will be revealed to all the nations (TLevi 4:4), among whom Israel will stand as a light (TLevi 14:34; TSim 7:2; TJud 22:3; 25:5; TBenj 9:5). Ethics. Although there is throughout the Testaments a stress on obedience to the Law, the ethical appeal rarely refers to specific legal statutes of the Torah. Rather, universal virtues are presented in a manner strongly reminiscent of Stoicism: integrity (TSim 4:5; TLevi 13:1; TIss 3:2; 4:8; 5:1; 7:8; TJud 23:5), piety (TReu 6:4; TIss 7:5; TLevi 16:2), uprightness (TIss 13:1; 4:6, TGad 7:7; TSim 5:2), honesty (TDan 1:3), generosity (TIss 3:8; 4:2; 7:3), compassion (TIss 7:5; TJud 18:3; TZeb 2:4; 5:1-3; 7:1-4; 8:6), hard work (TIss 5:3-5), and self-control (TJos 4:1-2; 6:7; 9:2-3; 10:2-3). Conversely, the grossest sin is sexual prom­iscuity (TReu 1:6; 1:9; 3:10-4:2; 4:7-8; 5:3-4; 6:1; TLevi 9:9; 14:6; 17:11; TSim 5:3; TIss 4:4; 7:2; TJud 11:1-5; 12:1-9; 13:5-8; 17:1-3; 18:2-6), a failing that Beliar exploits (TReu 4:10). But sexual misdeeds are not linked to specific commandments; rather, they are handled by injuctions to temperance or asceticism, for which there is no basis in the Torah. Sin is instigated not only by Beliar directly (TReu 4:8, 10), but also by the power of anger (TDan 2:1-5:2), of envy (TDan 1:4; TGad 7:1-7; TSim 4:5, 7, 9; 6:2), and of greed (TJud 17:1; 19:103). Women are inherently evil (TReu 5:1) and entice men (TReu 5:1-7; TJud 10:3-5; 15:5f.) as well as the Watchers (TReu 5:6) to commit sin. The sabbath law does not figure in the Testaments and circumcision is mentioned only in connection with the enforced circumcising and subsequent slaughter of the Shechemites by Jacob's sons. The issue there is not circumcision, however, but cruelty to fellow human beings. The food laws are mentioned only as a metaphor of moral purity (TAsh 2:9; 4:5). The resources for right living are God's spirit (TSim 4:4), one's conscience (TReu 4:3; TJos 20:2), God's fidelity (TJos 9:2), and the inherent power of good to overcome evil (TBenj 5). One of the highest virtues is brotherly love (TSim 4:7; TIss 5:2; TDan 5:4), which is instilled in the reader by both the negative example of the consequences of hatred of one's brother (TGad 3:1-5:11; TSim 2:6-7) and by the exemplary model of Joseph (TSim 4:5f.; TJos 17:2-8)."},{"pageNumber":833,"pageContent":"The Law is treated in the Testaments as a virtual synonym for wisdom (TLevi 13:1-9), as it is at times in rabbinical tradition. Unlike its function among the rabbis, however, in the Testaments, law (= wisdom) is universal in its application (TLevi 14:4) and is equated with natural law (TNaph 3). Accordingly, homosexuality and idolatry are condemned, not because they are specifically prohibited in the Torah, but because they are not compatible with the law of nature (TNaph 3:3-4). The linking of wisdom with natural law, including the movement of the heavenly bodies, goes beyond even the viewpoint expressed in Wisdom of Solomon 7. The understanding of law in the Testaments, with its movement away from legal requirements toward general moral ideals or to conscience, contrasts with that of the nascent Pharisaic movement of the period, the leaders of which were primarily concerned with the relevance of legal precepts to their daily lives, and with that of the Essenes, whose stringent interpretation of the Torah led them to withdraw from their Jewish co-religionists and from all outside contacts in order for them to maintain their Torah-demanded purity. The appeal to a universal law of nature in the Testaments is incompatible with the concept of the Torah as a protective wall of covenantal identity that characterized most of Jewish piety in the period of the second Temple and subsequently. Afterlife. In much of the writing there is no clear evidence of a hope of an afterlife (TIss 4:3); in some passages, however, the resurrection of the faithful is affirmed (TJud 25:1-4; TZeb 10:2). Relation to canonical books The blending of ethical exhortations and eschatological expectations recalls the teaching of Jesus in the gospel tradition in a general way, but the one obvious common element is the uniting of love for God with love for one's neighbor. \"Neighbor,\" however, seems to be understood in the Testaments as a fellow Israelite. The dyarchie (Levi and Judah) or triadic (Levi, Judah, the Prophet) messianic hopes of this writing are not present in the New Testament, although the messianic roles of prophet, priest, and king are assigned to Jesus in the various New Testament books (prophet in Lk 13:33; Jn 6:14; priest and king in Heb 7; king in Mt 2:2; Lk 19:38; Jn 1:49; Rev 19:16). The description of the high priest's investiture (TLevi 8:1-10) recalls the Christian's armor in Ephesians 6:13. It is only in the Christian interpolations that there are direct links—especially with Johannine thought and language—but these are, of course, secondary in nature and not part of the original document. The document offers rather different solutions for the same problems—messianic hope, eschatology, obedience to the Law—dealt with in the New Testament. Relation to apocryphal books This pseudepigraphon is the most extensively preserved representative of that part of the testamentary literature of the period of the second Temple that builds on Genesis 49 and the last words of Moses in order to serve as a vehicle for ethical and eschatological teaching. Closest to our work in specific content and literary method is Jubilees, although several fragments from the Dead Sea Scrolls show real kinship with the Testaments in detail (lQapGen, 4QPBless, HQMelch, 4QPrNab ar, 4QFlor). Still closer in form, though man­ifesting only occasional fragmentary verbal links, are the testamentary fragments (4QTLevi ar1; a fragment of TNaph in Heb.). Behind both the Qumran material and the Testaments stands an oral tradition expressed in testamentary form, but the verbal and conceptual differences are so great as to rule out literary dependence of our Greek documents on these Semitic texts. Cultural importance In antiquity the most significant impact of the Testaments was on the Christians, who took them up and adapted them to their own purposes. The most striking modern example of romantic expansion of the patriarchal narratives is Thomas Mann's massive Joseph cycle, where Joseph appears as something of a prig, just as he does to modern eyes in the Testaments."},{"pageNumber":834,"pageContent":"BIBLIOGRAPHY Charlesworth, PMR, pp. 211-20.

Rather, I was mourning over my sin, since it was so great. Never had anything like it been done in Israel. 1 2 \"And now give heed to me, my children, concerning the things which I saw 2 during my time of penitence, concerning the seven spirits of deceit.3 #For seven spirits are established against mankind, and they are the sources of the deeds of 3,4 youth. #And seven other spirits are given to man at creation so that by them »every human deed (is done). First is the spirit of life, with which man is created as a composite being. The second is the spirit of seeing, with which comes desire. 5 The third is the spirit of hearing, with which comes instruction. The fourth is the 6 spirit of smell, with which is given taste for drawing air and breath. #The fifth is 7 the spirit of speech, with which comes knowledge. »The sixth is the spirit of taste for consuming food and drink; by it comes strength, because in food is the substance 8 of strength. #The seventh is the spirit of procreation and intercourse, with which 9 come sins through fondness for pleasure. For this reason, it was the last in the creation and the first in youth, because it is filled with ignorajice; it leads the young person like a blind man into a ditch and like an animal over a cliff. 1 a. The simple fact that Reuben died is asserted in Jub 46:4, but no date for his demise is indicated. b. The pattern for instructions and exhortations to one's posterity, together with predictions con­cerning the future, was set by the tradition attrib­uted to Jacob (Gen 49). c. Although the Law is the declared norm for ethical behavior in T12P, the details of moral ob­ligation and the overall framework in which obe­dience to the Law is enjoined are shaped by Stoic virtues and by Stoic anthropological conceptions, and also by the dualistic notions of Jewish apoca­lypticism. Cf. TLevi 13:1-9; TIss 5:1, n. 2 a. The spirits of deceit seem to be human qual­ities, or at least each exploits some basic human quality (2:4-8). As such they are akin to the Stoic notion of spirits. Elsewhere in T12P, however, the evil spirits are personified, given specific names, and identified as the spirits of Beliar (alternate spelling, Belial; see n. on TReu 4:7), as in TIss 7:7, or as agents of Beliar, as in TAsh 6:4. Satan figures relatively infrequently in T12P (TDan 3:6; 5:6; 6:1; TGad 4:7; TAsh 6:4, in a text), whereas Beliar appears more than thirty times (depending on which textual tradition is used as the basis for the count).

From that time until now I have kept a careful watch and have not sinned. #So then, my children, observe all the things that I command you »and do not sin, for the sin of promiscuity is the pitfall of life, separating man from God and leading on toward idolatry, because it is the deceiver of the mind and the perceptions, and leads youths down to hell before their time. #For promiscuity has destroyed many.

For every woman who schemes in these ways is destined for eternal punishment. 6 For it was thus that they charmed the Watchers, who were before the Flood.3 As they continued looking at the women, they were filled with desire for them and Gen&M perpetrated the act in their minds. Then they were transformed into human males, and while the women were cohabiting with their husbands they appeared to them. Since the women's minds were filled with lust for these apparitions, they gave birth to giants.

Moral forces operate at two levels: the human and the demonic. If the human will is strong, Beliar is unable to gain control; if the will is weak, Beliar dominates. 5 a. In the story recounted in Gen 6:1-4, according to which sexual union between human females and heavenly male creatures violates the divine order, there is no clear assignment of blame. In Jub 4:15, where the narrative is elaborated, the heavenly Watchers come to offer moral instructions to the earthlings. But here blame is placed on the women, who are the villainesses, since they lure the Watch­ers into the illicit sexual relations, with dire con­sequences for the whole of the human race, as exemplified in their monstrous progeny. The Watchers appear in other texts of the period as well. Cf. CD 2.18; TNaph 3:5; Jub 4:22; 7:21; 8:3; 10:5; and often in the Enochic literature. 6 a.

In CD 7.15-20, however, the in­terpreter of the Law is identified as the star of Num 24:17, while in the Psalms of Joshua the role of the star and that of Levi are set side by side. The term for consummation of the ages is a technical one in apocalyptic literature (cf. TLevi 10:2). In TZeb 9:5 (b d g texts) the event is called simply \"in the last days.\" Cf.

The Cappadocians are mentioned also in lQapGen 21:23, where this designation replaces Ellasar (= Larsa) in the biblical text as Gen 14:9. The names of the enemies as here given, therefore, include both the traditional foes mentioned in the biblical accounts (Ham, the Amalekites) as well as those contemporary with the writer of the T12P. c. The MSS differ here in detail; some link the glorification with Seth rather than Shem; some omit the reference to God as \"the Great One in Israel.\" But all agree that God will be manifest \"as a man.'' Apparently, this is the first of the Christian inter­polations. The theological viewpoint of these in­sertions stresses the humanity of the \"body\" that \"God has taken\"—a view that was later denounced by orthodox Christians as Patripassianism, since it affirmed the suffering of the Father. The second part of this interpolation (TSim 6:7b), in addition to employing characteristically Christian language, interrupts the flow of thought in the passage as a whole. d. Possibly an affirmation of a doctrine of the resurrection of the righteous at the end of the age. Dan 12:2, on the other hand, teaches the resurrec­tion of both the just and the unjust. e.

Perhaps the \"great plague\" is the death of the firstborn (Ex 11:1-11), although the passage shifts to the plague of darkness. 1 a. The real writer of TLevi obviously thinks that he is standing near the day of judgment; hence his eagerness to convey his warnings and promises. 2 a. The story of the vengeance against Hamor and the men of Shechem (depicted as an individual) for having defiled Dinah is told in Gen 34. Here Levi is credited with having taken the initiative in slaughtering the male inhabitants. b. Abel-Maoul is apparently a variant spelling for Abel-Meholah (Judg 7:22). In the biblical tra­dition, the gift of understanding, which was granted to Solomon as king and archetypal wise man (IKgs 3:12) and to Daniel as seer (Dan 1:17), is linked with the spirit of the Lord and promised as a divine gift to the shoot from the royal Davidic line in Isa 11:1-3. c. The sleep, the vision, the mountain, the ascent to the heavens and on to the throne of God are standard elements in Merkabah (throne) mysticism. Based on the visions of the divine dwelling place in Isa 6 and Ezek 1 (cf. IEn 14 and 3En) as well as on the mountaintop visions granted to Moses and Elijah, this movement began to flourish in Judaism during the hellenistic period and influenced both apocalyptic and Jewish mystical tradition. d. The vision originally included three heavens, although in some forms of the text (a) 3:1-8 has been modified and expanded in order to depict seven heavens. Cf. 2Cor 12:2, where Paul ascends in a vision to the \"third heaven.\" e.

The wintry elements held in reserve for the day of judgment appear also in 2En 5:1; lEn 60:17-18; cf. Jub 37:1-10. b. Instruments of God's judgment; cf. Sir 39:28-31. The Holy Ones in 3:3 are angels. c. Great Glory is a favorite name of God in Merkabah circles; cf. lEn 14:19; 102:3; similar titles in lEn 25:3, 7; 47:3 (from Isa 6). d.

The intercessory angel served a necessary function at a time when stress on the notion of God's transcendence distanced him from mankind, as in this document. Michael fulfills this mediatorial role in Dan 10:13, 21; 12:1 (cf. IEn 20:5). An unnamed \"one\" intercedes in IEn 89:76 and in 90:14. The angel of peace aids the faithful in TDan 6:5; TAsh 6:4; TBenj 6:1; and in IEn 52:5; 53:4. In IEn 40:8 the roles of Michael and that of the angel of peace are linked.

The common Gk. word aspis is unknown as a place name, a phenomenon which suggests that the text as we have it, including the names of the locales, originated in a Gk.-speaking setting. Abima, though not distinctively Gk, is also other­wise unknown. The wide range of textual variants (Abila, Ameba, Abema, Abina) and conjectural readings (Abilene) show that the difficulty is an ancient one. b. In this passage—though not in Gen 34— Levi's opposition to circumcising the Shechemites was based on his determination to kill them in revenge, but he wanted to do so without resort to a subterfuge and without involving them, however superficially, in the sacred rites of the covenant people. c. Circumcision is not mentioned in the accounts of this incident in Jub 30 or Josephus, Ant 1.21, apparently on the ground that it was wrong to kill circumcised persons. In the Gen 49 account of Jacob's deathbed pronouncements, Simeon and Levi are cursed; in Deut 33, Moses' farewell bless­ings omit Simeon but promise Levi the roles of priest and instructor in the Law of God (Deut 33:8-11). d. Eblaen is otherwise unknown. The textual tradition offers a wide range of variants. 7 a. Sir 50:25-26 declares that the \"foolish peo­ple\" of Shechem are a non-nation; cf. CD 13.23-14.2. 8 a. Jacob's vision (Gen 28:10-17; 35:9; Jub 27:19-27) is replaced—or supplemented—in TLevi by Levi's vision.

Jub 32:3 represents Jacob as clothing Levi in the priestly garments. The investiture here described is performed by seven men (angels?) who are God's agents, as are the six who execute judgment in Ezek 9:2. The scene is offered in a more elaborate form in 4Q§irSabb 39. Similar references to the seven angels are found in lEn 20; 81:5; 87:2; 90:21; 3En 17-18. The basic biblical description of the priestly garb is given in Ex 28:3-43; Sir 45:8-12 portrays Aaron in a brief sketch. The virtues linked with the various garments are reminiscent of Eph 6:13-17, where the armor of God is described along similar lines. c. The anointing, as in Ex 28:41-43; 29:1-8; Ps 133:2. The process of robing the high priest on the Day of Atonement is described in Lev 16:1-34. Bread and wine are Melchizedek's offering in Gen 14:18;cf. Ps 110:4. lQapGen 22:14 retells the story of Melchizedek's bringing food and drink to Abram, but with no elaboration of the concise Genesis account. d. The climax of the investiture of Levi as priest is the giving of the priestly diadem, but that is followed by an enigmatic reference to a threefold office (8:11). The first office is \"greater\" than the others; the second is the priesthood; the third is the kingship, although it is granted to Judah rather than to Levi (8:14) and is immediately defined as a \"new priesthood.\" That new role, which is said to follow the model of the gentiles, may allude to the Mac-cabean priest-kings, with their increasingly secular discharge of the dual role. e. Having blended priestly and kingly roles, the office is associated with that of prophet, and then with those of judge and scribe. Clearly the present form of the text is confused, or at least has under­gone substantial modification from the typical dyar-chic pattern of Levi as priest and Judah as king. Butcf. Jub 31:14f. 9 a. The story parallels that of Isaac's blessing Jacob and Esau (Gen 27) and is given in a more elaborate form in Jub 31:8-23, where Levi is blessed (as priest) by Isaac's right hand and Judah by his left hand (as king). b. In Jub 32:1, it is Levi rather than Jacob who has the dream vision at Bethel (Gen 28). The paying of tithes recalls Abraham's payment to Melchizedek in Gen 14:20. c.

The conflict between Jacob (and sons) and Esau (and sons) is also reported, with minor vari­ations, in Jub 38:1-24. Both accounts expand on the biblical evidence for conflict between the sons of Isaac (Gen 27) and on the personal and place-names in the genealogy of Esau in Gen 36. 10 a. There are in TJud 10-13 three motifs in the portrayal of the evils resulting from sexual irre­sponsibility or promiscuity: (1) the scheming mother theme in 10-12; (2) the seductive widow in 12; (3) the plotting father-in-law, who not only decks out his daughter for enticement purposes but also offers wealth as an added inducement for taking her (13). The confusion of names in the textual tradition is only incidental; central is the delineation of these modes of seduction. b. Here is specified why Er's wickedness led to his death: Contrary to the divine priorities (as our author discerns them), exogamy is a graver moral issue for him and his mother than is his failure to beget posterity (cf. 10:6). Also Er's death without offspring and Onan's failure to fulfill his obligation to his dead brother are blamed on the scheming, xenophobic mother.

The final defeat of God's enemies is foreseen as occurring on this mountain as well (Zech 14, especially vss. 3-4).

The bull is linked with Joseph in Deut 33:13-17. The eagle's wings recall Ezek 17:3, while the eagle image itself appears in Ezek 1:10 and is then taken up in Rev 4:7 and 12:14. Here Joseph seeks to control both bull and eagle. If these animals are to be interpreted as representing earthly powers, then possibly the bull is Alexander, the horns are the Seleucids and the Ptolemies; the eagle is the Ro­mans, a rising power in the west during the 2nd and 1st cent.

A NEW TRANSLATION AND INTRODUCTION BY R. P. SPITTLER The Testament of Job resembles the form and purpose of the better-known Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs. It is slightly shorter than Paul's Letter to the Romans, and commends the virtue of endurance (or patience: hypomone) based on the biblical character, Job. It is not equal to the literary and philosophic grandeur of the canonical book of Job but is prosaic and at times humorous. A Prologue (ch. 1) gives the title and setting. An Epilogue (chs. 51-53) describes Job's death, soul ascent, and burial. The main body of the Testament (chs. 2-50) falls into four literary divisions: Job relates in turn to a revealing angel (chs. 2-5), to Satan (chs. 6-27), to the three kings (chs. 28-45), and to his three daughters (chs. 46-50). The bulk of the testament (1:4-45:4), embracing the first three of the four sections, is Job's first-person account of the cause and consequences of his sickness. At the end of his life, the patriarch (identified as Jobab, a descendant of Esau, before God named him Job) gathers his children for last words of counsel and for distribution of his estate (ch. 1). Job's perplexity over the idolatry he sees (chs. 2f.) occasions the appearance of an angel, who promises catastrophe yet renown (ch. 4) should Job persist in his resolve to destroy the idol's shrine. He does (ch. 5). Satan's consequent attack on Job (chs. 6-27) begins subtly with his disguise as a beggar (chs. 6-8) seeking to take advantage of Job's generosity and piety, which Job recounts at length (chs. 9-15). But the former charities are displaced by tragic losses (chs. 16-26) in property, family, and health. Nevertheless, Job endures nobly and when Satan finally confronts him directly, it is to surrender before the athlete of endurance (ch. 27). The three kings appear, astonished at the extent of Job's calamities (chs. 28-30): Eliphas laments Job's losses (chs. 31-34). Baldad tests his sanity (35:1-38:5). Sophar offers their royal physicians (38:6-8). As a final blow, Job's grieving wife, Sitis, dies and is buried (chs. 39f.). Finally, Elihu speaks (ch. 41). The kings are forgiven by Job's intercession (ch. 42), while Elihu is cursed (ch. 43). Job recovers (ch. 44), gives final counsels, and divides the inheritance among his seven sons (ch. 45). When the three daughters inquire about their share of the inheritance, Job calls for the triple-stranded phylactery by which he was cured when at God's direction he girded himself (ch. 46). As one of the magical cords is given to each of the daughters in turn, they lose interest in earthly concerns and begin to speak ecstatically in the language of angels (chs. 47-50), yielding hymns said to have been preserved by Nereus, Job's brother (ch. 51) and blessing God in their distinctive dialects as the soul of Job is carried off in a heavenly chariot (ch. 52). Finally (ch. 53), Job's body is buried with a proper lament. Text The Testament of Job survives in four Greek manuscripts, in an Old Church Slavonic version, and in an incomplete Coptic version.

Preliminary details12 show the Coptic text (Sahidic dialect, with Bohairic influence) differs from the Greek. This oldest (A.D. 5th cent.) of witnesses to the text of the Testament of Job will aid the production of a critical text. Original language Earlier modern scholars (Kohler, James, Riessler) held the work to have been written originally in Hebrew, even though no manuscript evidence of a Semitic origin exists. Strongest considerations supporting the possibility of a Hebrew original arise from hymnic portions of the text, where such phrases as \"while crowns lead the way with praises\" (43:14) may reflect Hebraisms. An Aramaic origin was argued by C. C. Torrey,13 on alleged linguistic grounds. But his arguments have convinced few modern scholars.14 Greek is most likely the language in which the Testament of Job was originally composed. No Semitic versions or manuscripts are known. Moreover, the close, though complicated, linguistic relation of the Testament to the Septuagint Book of Job provides the strongest argument in favor of original composition in Greek. 1 J.

Especially is this true of the speech of Job's wife: Two sentences appear in the Hebrew text (\"Do you hold fast your integrity? Curse God and die.\" Job 2:9). These become a plaintive paragraph in the Septuagint, while the Testament of Job (24f.) gives Job's wife a name (Sitis) and embellishes her speech even more. Similarly, the Septuagint differs from the Masoretic text at the end of the Book of Job: The Greek version closes with a paragraph about Job's homeland and his ancestors (Job 42:17b-e LXX). This longer Septuagint ending shows correspondences with the Testament of Job. It also embodies marked parallels to an Aristeas fragment preserved by Alexander Polyhistor (in Eusebius, PrEv 9.25.1-4). The Testament of Job draws mainly from the narrative framework of the Septuagint Book of Job, which appears at Job 1-2; 42:7-17. But in addition, Job 29-31 (LXX) furnished Testament of Job 9-16 with numerous concepts and phrases by which to amplify Job's wealth, piety, and generosity. At times, merely a phrase of the Septuagint language is worked into the Testament (seven thousand sheep: Job 1:3 LXX; TJob 9:3). In a few instances, more complete Septuagint quotations appear. Reliance of the testament on the Septuagint is clear also from the testament's agreement with Septuagint passages where there is no Hebrew equivalent (e.g. TJob 13:5). As yet unresolved is the complicated problem of the textual relations between the several Greek manuscripts of the Testament of Job and the textual growth of the Septuagint Book of Job. The testament genre The mere phrase \"My son(s),\" found already in short units of wisdom literature (e.g. Prov 5:1, 7), implies the essence of the testament (diatheke): A wise aged (and usually dying) father imparts final words of ethical counsel to his attentive offspring. In the major biblical instance—the blessing of Jacob on his twelve sons (Gen 47:29-50:14)—specific elements characteristic of the later Jewish testaments already appear: (1) An ill father (48:1), (2) near death (47:29), (3) and on his bed (47:31), (4) calls his sons (49:1), (5) disposes of his goods (48:22), and (6) issues a forecast of events to come (49:1, et passim). The father (7) dies (49:33) and (8) a lamentation ensues (50:2-14). Each of these features appears in the Testament of Job. J. Munck15 found a sufficient grouping of these features in late Jewish (e.g. Tob 14:3-11; lEn 91:1-19) as well as New Testament (Acts 20:17-38; ITim 4:1-16) literature to identify the \"farewell address\" as a widely used literary technique in which features of the testament genre show up in literature not in the testament form. The notion of the term \"testament\" in the sense of a legal will, not to mention the derived notion of a spiritual legacy, was only possible as a hellenistic development. For the Hebrew language apparently has no specific word for \"testament,\" even though inheritance laws flourished in Israel. The Hebrew term bryt refers to a covenant or a contract, not a will. The first century B.C. and the first century A.D. were eminently the centuries of the testament. Some products of the genre of that era were absorbed into other works: The Testament of Moses, composed in the first century A.D., was absorbed into the Assumption of Moses. The Testament of Hezekiah, a Christian product, must have originated late in the first century A.D.; but since the second to fourth centuries A.D., it has been part of the Ascension of Isaiah (3:13b-4:18). In its Greek form, the Testament of Adam probably goes back to the environs of the first century A.D. The Testament of Abraham is another first-century A.D. product. The fourth-century Christian document Constitutiones apostolorum (6.16.3) in its list of apocryphal works cites the4 * apocryphal books ... of the three patriarchs,'' which presumably refers to the testaments of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who are elsewhere widely remembered together. In the Testament of Orpheus appears a Jewish-hellenistic text that called on the pagan mystagogue as a witness to monotheism. 15 \"Discours d'adieu dans le Nouveau Testament et dans la literature biblique,\" in O. Cullmann and P. Menoud, eds., Aux sources de la tradition chritienne (M. Goguel Festschrift) (Neuchatel/Paris, 1950) pp. 155-70."},{"pageNumber":885,"pageContent":"Subsequent Christian testaments display tendencies: The third-century Testament of Sol­omon was a guide to magical exorcistic rites. The Testamentum Domini (extant only in Syr.) reflects ecclesiastical interests of the fourth and fifth centuries. The strong ethical note of the earlier Jewish testaments endured throughout the Middle Ages, when Jewish scholars wrote (wonpseudepigraphic) moral wills for their children. The earliest of these was the Orhot Hayyim (\"Ways of Life\"), written by Eliezer Ben Isaac Gershom around A.D. 1050. In his study Jewish Magic and Superstition, J. Trachtenberg16 made use of very late representatives of this genre, including the Testament of Judah the Pius and the Testament of Shabbetae Horowitz, dated in the sixteenth century A.D. Development also characterized the testament genre; it obtained the sense of a will, which legally specified the testator's wishes regarding the disposition of his estate following death. Testamentum Platonis (in Diogenes Laertius 3.41-43) provides a first-century B.C. example. The same classical author preserves (among others) the will of Theophrastus (Diogenes Laertius 5.51-57). Wealthy persons could designate the establishment of memorial cults or institutions, resulting in such epigraphic remains as the Testamentum Galli, the Testamentum Epicuri, and the Testamentum Epictetae. Showing the possibilities of evolving literary elaboration of this form, the Testament of Diogenes (c. A.D. 200) is a summary of the philosopher's parting words inscribed on a wall for travelers to see. Similarly, the third- or fourth-century A.D. Testamentum Porcelli was said by Jerome to amuse schoolboys, since it was a \"satiric parody\" of a will contrived by a pig named Grunnius Corocotta prior to his slaughter. But it is above all the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs with which the Testament of Job most readily aligns. As do these, the Testament of Job (1) opens with a deathbed scene; (2) celebrates a virtue; (3) offers moral exhortations; and (4) closes with the death, burial, and lamentation scene. But the Testament of Job embodies distinctive modifications of the testament genre. It treats but one biblical character, who was not from the Torah but from the wisdom literature. Of the features identified as characteristic of the testament genre, the Testament of Job may, in comparison with the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, be said to be more haggadic, considerably less hortatory, and almost entirely devoid of any apocalyptic element. It is fair to say that the biblical details have undergone considerably more haggadic embellishment in the Testament of Job than in the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, which nowhere equal the hagiographic fantasy apparent in the extensive magnification of Job's generosity (TJob 9-15). Exhortation in the Testament of Job is almost limited to 45:1-3, which may have been an original end to an earlier form of the testament. The' 'two-ways\"—the way of righteousness and the way of evil—motif does not appear. Overall, the Testament of Job is a far more artistic tale—a \"novelized\" testament, one might say—than the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs. Traditional apocalyptic features in the Testament of Job show through only slightly, such as in the description of the splendorous sashes Job bequeathed his daughters (TJob 46:7f.) or the appearance of the angel (TJob 3-5). There is no assumption to heaven (nor even seven or three heavens), no tour of celestial scenes with an angelic interpreter (the angel is not heard of again), and no foreboding promises of cosmic doom. There is, in the Testament of Job, no messianism (as in TLevi 18), no \"Belial\" nor any named angels, no sense of eschatological imminence, no concern for the end of the age, and no discontent with the present world. To the contrary, the praise of Job's philanthropy amounts to praise of social institutions. The Testament of Job does not indulge in portentous grotesque symbolism or in apocalyptic zoology. Although it has been drawn up by one disinterested in the testament form, the Testament of Job more nearly retains testamentary elements than does, for example, the Testament of Abraham, the Testament of Isaac, or the Testament of Jacob. It clearly aligns more with the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs than with the legal or literary pagan \"testaments\" or the medieval Hebraic varieties. 16 Cleveland/New York, 1961."},{"pageNumber":886,"pageContent":"Provenance, purpose, and date The Testament of Job was almost certainly written in Greek, probably during the first century B.C. or A.D., and possibly among the Egyptian Jewish sect called the Therapeutae, described extensively by Philo in his tract Vita contemplativa. Although Christian editing is possible, the work is essentially Jewish in character. It draws heavily from the Septuagint Book of Job, to which text the Testament of Job also may have contributed. Characteristic features of the text include Job's affirmation of the \"upper world\" (hypercosmios), concerns for proper burial, and attention to women. Some aspects of the Testament of Job resemble those found in the sectarian Qumran texts, but more singular interests appear in its use of magic and \"merkabah mysticism\" (Jewish mystical speculation focusing on God's chariot, mrkbh). The earliest modern opinion on the Testament of Job was that of Cardinal Mai,17 who concluded that the work was produced by a Christian. James,18 although suggesting that it may have had a Semitic origin, claimed that in its present form the work stems from a second-century A.D. Christian, born a Jew, who put the Hebrew original into Greek and added his own material (TJob 46-53 and the poetic pieces at TJob 25, 32, 33, 43). A decade after James, F. Spitta19 published an extensive study on the Testament of Job. He concluded that the testament is a piece of pre-Christian folk piety not attributable to the Essenes. He also argued that the tradition about Job lay behind the New Testament portrayal of Jesus as sufferer. Similarly, D. Rahnenfuhrer20 views the Testament of Job as a pre-Christian, non-Essene text the purpose of which was to serve propagandistic missionary interests of hellenistic Judaism. M. Delcor21 suggests that the invasion of Palestine by the Persian general Pacorus in 40 B.C. may lie behind the reference to Satan's disguise as the \"king of the Persians\" (TJob 17:2). But J. Collins22 tempers this proposal, noting that Persian kings were traditional enemies of Egyptian royalty. As the testament suggests a time of persecution, when the \"patience\" (or \"endurance\") it commends would be specially relevant, Collins proposes a first-century A.D. date as more likely. But the state of the evidence hardly permits any more precise dating than the first century B.C. or A.D. About the same time as James, near the end of the last century, K. Kohler23 described the Testament of Job as an Essene Midrash on the biblical Book of Job, possibly traceable to the Therapeutae. More recently, M. Philonenko24 re-evaluated Kohler's thesis in view of the Qumran finds. He concluded that the Egyptian Therapeutae are to be distinguished from the Qumran Essenes and that the former is a more likely source for the Testament of Job than the latter. While the Essenes were misogynists, the Therapeutae allowed women a significant role. Prayer toward the east (TJob 40:3) also characterizes the Therapeutae (Vita cont 89). Most impor­tantly, Philo recounts (80) how spontaneous hymnic compositions sprang from sacred meetings of the Therapeutae, in which both men and women were present. Several internal features of the testament appear to confirm an Egyptian origin. Job is called \"the king of all Egypt\" (TJob 28:7). The reference to Job's \"fifty bakeries\" (TJob 10:7) finds no Septuagint source, as do many of the quantities mentioned in the Testament. The Therapeutae held the number fifty in special reverence, perhaps as a reference to the Feast of Pentecost. Gem collecting, attributed to Job (TJob 28:4f.; 32:5; cf. Job 31:24 LXX), was an Egyptian royal pastime according to Theophrastus (De lapidibus 24.55). A few considerations warrant hesitancy in accepting an Egyptian provenance among the 17 Mai, Scriptorum veterum nova collectio, vol. 7, col. 191. 18 Apocrypha Anecdota, pp. xciii-xciv. 19 \"Das Testament Hiobs und das Neue Testament,\" Zur Geschichte undLiteratur des Urchristentoms, vol. 3, pt. 2, p. 165. 20 \"Das Testament des Hiob und das Neue Testament,\" ZNW 62 (1971) 88-93. 21 \"Le Testament de Job, la priere de Nabonide et les traditions targoumiques,\" in S.

Philo made a special point (70-72) about the absence of slaves in the community of the Therapeutae; yet they are assumed in the Testament of Job, and are both male (13:4) and female (14:4). Philo does not mention any glossolalic hymn singing, as does the Testament of Job (48:3; 50:1). Nor does he include laments among the forms or purposes of the hymns of the Therapeutae. Even so, an origin of the Testament among the Egyptian Therapeutae seems very possible. But has there been any Christian editing? Job's first-person address ends at chapter 45. Testament of Job 46-53 supplements 1-45 in reporting Job's recovery. Apocalyptic language more conspicuously appears in chapters 46-53, which contain no extended poetic piece to match those found in chapters 1-45. In the single reference to the devil found in 46-53, he is called \"the enemy\" (TJob 47:10), while the terms \"Satan,\" the \"devil,\" and the \"evil one\" appear in 1-45. Spittler25 suggested that the Testament may have been reworked in the second century by Montanists. Eusebius (HE 5.17.1-4) preserves the argument of an unnamed anti-Montanist who demanded to know where in the range of biblical history any precedent appeared for ecstatic prophecy. The descriptions of Job's daughters speaking in ecstasy (TJob 48-50) may have been a Montanist move to supply such a precedent. Furthermore, the document— or at least the tradition it preserves, that of Job's return of the escaping worm to his body (TJob 20:8f.)—is reflected in one of Tertullian's books (De anima 14.2-7) written just before his Montanist period. The following reconstruction of the origin and development of the Testament of Job mingles probabilities with possibilities. The result is a scenario for the emergence of the Testament of Job that must be seen as conjectural; how in fact the Testament arose cannot be described with faultless historical accuracy. Somewhere in the second half of the first century B.C., a member of the Therapeutae near Alexandria produced a \"testament\" in praise of patience, which is surely a \"contemplative\" virtue. Although he (or someone before him) may have used a Semitic original, his own work bore unmistakable evidences of a lover of the Septuagint. Having himself spontaneously composed hymns at the Therapeutae vigils, and with his poetic skills now refined by writing, he—or she—produced at least three (TJob 25, 32, 43; 33?) poetic pieces in the work. As the document left the Therapeutic community and found its way to the Phrygian regions, it was in Greek and consisted of the Testament of Job 1-45, a true \"testament\" of a tested servant (therapon) of God. The work was artful enough—at least so far as the speech of Job's wife (TJob 24) is concerned—to have been interlaced with the developing text of the Septuagint. If the Testament was influential enough to have affected the Septuagint text, or been affected by it, it may be no surprise to find it in Phrygian regions two centuries later. When the new prophecy erupted, there was no contest over canon, scripture, or doctrine. When, however, the original Montanist trio passed and the foretold end had not yet come, the movement organized and prophetic ecstasy spread. Prophetic virgins constituted them­selves into an institution. At one point—before A.D. 195—an anti-Montanist writer demanded of the Montanists where in scripture prophecy in ecstasy might be claimed. In an era of canonical flexibility, a Montanist apologist, probably of Jewish background, made use of a \"testament\" known to him and in which he found ideas compatible with his own species of Judaistic practice. By creating Testament of Job 46-53, possibly inserting chapter 33, and certain other restyling, the apologist for the new prophecy produced a text wherein the daughters of Job were charismatically, or magically, lifted into prophetic ecstasy, enabling them to speak in the language of angels. The work remained in Montanist hands as a propaganda text, perhaps particularly useful for Jews. Tertullian, at any rate, came by the text even before he became a Montanist. He used this Jewish testament in praise of patience in producing his own work De patientia. The work may even have played some part in his attraction to the Montanist movement. By the sixth century, the work appeared on a list of proscribed apocrypha, the Gelasian Decree. But even before then it had been translated into Coptic, showing its continued popularity in Egypt. By the tenth century, it had been translated into Slavonic. In spite of four late medieval Greek manuscripts, the work remained virtually unknown in the West till modern times. 25 Spittler, Testament of Job, pp. 58-69."},{"pageNumber":888,"pageContent":"Theological importance As a whole, the theological outlook of the Testament of Job aligns with hellenistic Judaism. The living (37:2) and just (43:13) God is the one who created heaven, earth, the sea, and mankind (2:4). God is called the \"Master of virtues,, (despotes ton areton 50:2) as well as the \"Demiurge\" (39:12), but without subsequent gnostic notions attached to that term. The title \"Father\" (33:3, 9; 40:3; 47:11; cf. 50:3; 52:6; see n. i to 52) need not be viewed as a Christian intrusion (see n. g to 33). In the Testament, it is Job's zeal against an idol's shrine (2-5) that is made the occasion of the calamities that befall him. God is the receiver of praise (14:3) and present in praise (51:1). He is Job's source of healing, the creator of physicians (38:8), to the end that even at death Job felt no pain (52: If.). Human nature in the Testament of Job is subject to the deception of the devil (3:3), exemplified in the various disguises assumed by Satan in his opposition to Job (see n. c to 6). Job's wife, his servants, and he himself are the objects of Satan's attacks. Indeed, a highly developed doctrine of Satan marks the Testament. He is variously identified as Satan (6:4), the devil (3:3), the evil one (7:1 V), the enemy (47:10). He is not human (23:2; cf. 42:2) nor of flesh, as Job (27:2), but is a spirit (27:2) who was responsible for the nefarious inspiration of Elihu (41:5f.; cf. 17:If.). As in the canonical account, Satan derives his limited authority from God (8:1-3; cf. Job 1:12; 2:6). The notion of angels in the testament corresponds to Jewish and Christian thought. An interpreting angel, also called a \"light\" (4:1; cf. 3:1), figures in Testament of Job 2-5 in a manner characteristic of Jewish and Christian apocalyptic. Job's daughters speak in ecstasy the language of the angels (48:3), the archons (49:2), and the cherubim (50:2). Unidentified heavenly creatures (angels?), functioning as the psychopomps of Greek mythology, carry off Job's soul at his death (52:6-10; cf. 47:11). Distinctive emphasis is given in the testament to a cosmological dualism that inculcates a certain otherworldliness. This motif most clearly appears in Job's psalm of affirmation, in which he boldly asserts, \"My throne is in the upper world\" (33:3). By contrast, this world and its kingdoms pass away (33:4, 8), a claim that infuriates the friendly kings who came to help (34:4). But the cosmic superiority of the upper world—which nowhere is elaborately described in the Testament of Job—also emerges in the effects of the charismatic sashes once they are donned by Job's daughters. Their hearts were changed, they no longer cared for earthly things, they used the tongues of angels (48-50). Even so, the testament celebrates Job's exemplary care for the poor (9-13), which is an earthbound enterprise to which he returns following his recovery (44:2-5). Several eschatological ideas exist side by side in the testament. Among the rewards promised Job by the angel is participation in the resurrection (4:9; cf. n. c to 4). Job's children, who died when their house collapsed (39:8), however, need no burial; they were taken directly to heaven by their creator (39:8-40:3). Yet the testament ends with a description of Job's soul being carried off in a chariot (52:10); his body is buried a few days later (53:5-7). In fact, burial concerns are a distinct interest of the testament, reflecting its Jewish origin. Not only did Job's wife, Sitis, plead for the burial of her children (39:1-10), her own burial is told in detail: the procession, the place, the lament used, even animals mourning her death (40:6-14). Similarly, Job's burial is described (53:5-7). The poetic compositions at Testament of Job 25 and 32 stem from the lament form, the life setting of which was the funeral. A high interest in women marks the testament. This first appears in the names given to both Job's present wife (Dinah) and his earlier spouse (Sitis). Sitis, unnamed at Job 2:9f. in the canonical account, becomes a leading figure in the testament, which extensively elaborates her speech (TJob 24:1-25:10) compared to the Septuagint adjustment of the Masoretic text (TJob 24:1-25:10; Job 2:9a-d LXX). More than this, in Testament of Job 21-26 Sitis becomes something of a figure of pity, driven to enslavement and finally forced to sell her hair ignominiously to Satan. Even so, the Sitis cycle functions to accentuate Job's troubles. In the Testament of Job 39-40, she reappears on behalf of her deceased—but as yet unburied—children, three of whom were women. No less than six words are used in the Testament of Job for female slave.26 Widows, too, 26 Pais (7:3); doule (7:7); therapaine (14:4); paidiske (21:2); doulis (21:3); latris (24:2); all are used with the feminine article."},{"pageNumber":889,"pageContent":"make their appearance: Job is their champion. (His funeral dirge has the line \"Gone is the clothing of widows!\" 53:3.) And by his musical skills Job could quell their murmuring (14:1-5). At Testament of Job 13:4-6 (quoting Job 31:31 LXX) complaints against Job are attributed specifically to his male servants, apparently exonerating the female servants mentioned at Job 31:31 (LXX). Aside from the wives, the widows, and the slaves, there are the daughters of Job already named in the canon and said to have had such beauty that \"Throughout the land there were no women as beautiful as the daughters of Job\" (Job 42:15). The fact that \"their father gave them inheritance rights like their brothers\" triggered a distinct section of the testament (46-50), where the earlier interest in patience has been displaced by a concern for ecstatic and perhaps magical participation in the upper world through glossolalia. Finally, the motif of endurance, or patience (hypomone), receives high praise in the testament. The degree to which this theme is worked into the testament is clear evidence of its kinship with the testament genre. Job is the hero of patience; he is born to it (1:5). If he is patient—the angel promises (4:6)—he will gain fame and be restored. On the dung heap, he invites his wife Sitis to endure with him (26:5). Underwriting the charitable exploits of others whose mismanagement led to bankruptcy, Job acceded to their pleas for patience (11:10). He would undergo whatever Satan could bring; that adversary finally learned Job could not be enticed away from patience to contempt (20:1). Job was like the underdog wrestler who nevertheless won the match \"because he showed endurance and did not grow weary\" (27:4). It was their prior knowledge of Job and his former happy estate—and not their patience—that led to the speechlessness of the king-friends upon their discovery of Job (28:5). Sitis bitterly condemns Job's dung heap motto: \"Only a little longer!\" (24:1). No more fitting summary of the hortatory intent of the testament could be quoted than 27:7: \"Now then, my children, you also must be patient in everything that happens to you. For patience is better than anything.\"27 Cultural importance Rejected by the rabbis and the Church, the Testament of Job not surprisingly has been virtually unnoticed till modern times and has had little detectable effect on the development of Western culture. Nothing in Archibald MacLeish's play J.B., for example, suggests any roots traceable to the testament. Early Church Fathers developed parallels between Job and Jesus as sufferers, a theme at times expressed in early medieval Christian art. Tertullian may have used the testament in some form of its literary history (see n. f to 20). According to Kohler28 the Islamic tradition preserves features of the saga of Job distinctive to the testament. A few plays and works on the biblical book of Job from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century were cited over a century ago in a short preface to the first French translation of the testament.29 Whether or not any of these reflects aspects of the story of Job distinctive to the testament remains to be investigated (as do possible relations between the text traditions of the testament and the Vulgate). The chief contribution of the Testament of Job lies in its witness to the sectarian diversity of hellenistic Judaism. Much of its vocabulary and concepts it shares with the New Testament, as well as with other contemporary literature in the testament genre. Here in a single document, however, typical hellenistic Jewish monotheistic propaganda and moral exhortation mix with a primitive form of Merkabah mysticism, with the sharply dualistic outlook at Qumran (especially TJob 43), with the beginnings of Jewish magic (46:3-47:6), and with a Montanist-like interest in angelic glossolalia. The testament is in fact a valuable monument to the rich variety of hellenistic Jewish piety. 27 Some of the T12P, rather than commending virtues, condemn vices, as TSim (envy), TJud (love of money, fornication). TJob incidentally depreciates arrogance (alazoneia, 15:8), exultation (gauriama, 33:6), boasting (kaukema, 33:8), scorn (Jkataphronesis, 15:6), contempt (oligoria, 20:1), pride (hyperephania, 15:8); all are inconsistent with enduring patience. 28 Semitic Studies, pp. 292-95. 29 J.

This choice is not supported in the extant Greek witnesses, but it draws partial support from the Coptic version as well as from the order of appearance of Job's friends in the Septuagint (see n. a to 31). Versification follows that of Brock.

All marginal references to Job are to the Septuagint version. A number standing by itself refers to the verse of that number in the same chapter.

Reference is made probably to the Jobab of Gen 36:33f., who is described as the second king of Edom. This suggests a setting in the patriarchal era, confirmed by Job's genealogy \"from the sons of Esau\" (TJob 1:6). Similarly, Job 42:17c LXX describes Job as a descendant of Abraham and speaks (in reverse order from TJob) of \"Jobab, the one called Job\" (42:17d). c. Following the testament form, 1:2-7 pictures Job at the end of his life (248 years old, according to 53:8 S V Slav), his children gathered around him, about to urge endurance (hypomone) by a recital of his own famed perseverance. d. But, according to 52:1, he fell ill without pain or suffering, due to the miraculous effects of the splendorous girdle (46.7f.) by which he had re­covered from his earlier stroke (47:4-8). Among the T12P, TReu (1:2) and TSim (1:2) likewise describe their subjects as ill as part of the deathbed scene, while TLevi (1:2), TNaph (1:2), and TAsh (1:2) each expressly state the patriarch is in good health even though—in conjunction with the tes­tament form—about to die. e. The second set of ten children: The first ten (also seven sons and three daughters according to Job 1:2, but not specifically so stated in TJob) were all lost in Job's tragedy (TJob 1:6; 18:1; cf. Job l:18f.). The total and the male-female ratio thus agree with Job 42:13. On seven sons, cf. Ruth 4:15; ISam 2:51; Tob 14:3A. Job's 7,000 sheep and 3,000 camels (Job 1:3; cf. TJob 9:2-4) appear in the same ratio. f. V Slav omit all names. S omits the first five. The seven sons, listed first, play no further role in TJob (cf. 46: If.), while the daughters figure prom­inently in 46-53. g.

In TJob the wife of Job's trials is named Sitis (n. b to 25), while the mother of the ten children just named and before whom Job declares this \"testament\" is Dinah, the daughter of Jacob and Leah (Gen 20:31; 46:15). That makes Job an in-law to the twelve patriarchs and thereby further legitimates a testament from one outside the circle of patriarchal worthies, Abra­ham, Isaac, Jacob, and the twelve sons of Jacob.

Job and the Revealing Angel (2-5)a Job's perplexity over idolatry i,2 2 Now I used to be Jobab before the Lord named me Job. •When I was called 3 Jobab, I lived quite near a venerated idol's temple.b *As I constantly saw whole- 3:6; 4:i,4; 5:2; burnt offerings being offered up there, I began reasoning within myself saying, 17:4 4 \"Is this really the God who made heaven and earth, the sea too,c and our very selves? How shall I know?\" 1 3 One night as I was in bed a loud voice came to me in a very bright light saying, 4:i; 5:2; 18:5,8 2 \"Jobab, Jobab!\" #And I said, \"Yes? Here I am.\" And he said, \"Arise, and I will 3 show you who this is whom you wish to know. •This one whose whole-burnt offerings they bring and whose drink offerings they pour is not God. Rather, his is the power of the devil,3 by whom human nature5 is deceived.\" 4,5 When I heard these things, I fell on my bed worshiping and saying, «\"My Lord, 6 who came for the salvation of my soul, «I beg you—if this is indeed the place of 47:ii; 52.5,6,10 Satanc by whom men are deceived—grant me authority to go and purge his place 7 so that I may put an end to the drink offerings being poured for him. Who is there to forbid me, since I rule this region?\"d     28:7; 29:3 The angel's disclosure of impending calamities 1 4 The light8 answered me and said, \"You shall be able to purge this place. But 3:i I am going to show you all the things which the Lord charged me to tell you.\" 2 a. TJob here (2-5) blends apocalyptic features into the testament form. A revealing angel responds in a night vision to Job's concern over a nearby idol's shrine. His destruction of it, authorized by the angel, becomes the cause of Satan's attack on Job. The nighttime sleep interrupted by a voice and a light, the perplexity motif, worship of the revealing angel, the call by name, all these are typical features of apocalypses roughly contem­porary with TJob; e.g. 2En 1:2-9A; 4Ezra 3:1-4; 4:lf.; 3Bar 1:2-8; Rev 1:9-19. Such features are not common in the T12P, but cf. TLevi 2:4-6. b. Elsewhere the pagan temples are called \"the place of Satan\" (3:6; 4:4), \"the temple of the idol\" (5:2), \"the temple of the great god ... the place of drink offerings ... the house of god\" (17:4). Opposition to idolatry in TJob 2-5 resembles the similar iconoclasm of Abraham (Jub 12:12). c. Quite nearly a creedal formula at Ps 145 (146):6; Acts 4:24; 14:15; Rev 10:6; 14:7, probably arising from Ex 20:11; Neh 9:6 (2Ezra 19:6 LXX). Except for Rev 14:7 (which has \"and every water-spring\"), these all add \"and all that is in them\" (or similarly), for which TJob alone reads, \"and our very selves.\" In all cases the order heaven, earth, and sea is retained. Cf. Jub 2:2 (where the addition is \"all the spirits\" [angels], which are then extensively enumerated); PrMan 2f.; Jdt 13:18. 3 a. Elsewhere \"the devil\" is called \"Satan\" (3:6), \"the enemy\" (47:10; cf. 7:11, Slav addition to 53:8), and in V only \"the evil one\" (7:1; 20:2) and \"wretched one\" (27:1). Belial (or Beliar) does not appear. Satan as enemy: TDan 6:3f.; Mt 13:39; Lk 10:18f. b. The phrase \"human nature\" occurs in the NT only at Jas 3:7, where various bestial natures are said to have been tamed by it. TJob elsewhere shows sensitivity to the distinction between human and beastly (39:10) or Satanic (7:5; 42:2) natures. Such deception by Satan later in TJob overtakes Job's doormaid (7:6), his wife (23:11), and threat­ens even Job himself (26:6). c. The \"place of Satan\" is not as strongly po­lemic as the NT expression \"synagogue of Satan\" (Rev 2:9; 3:9) and \"the place where Satan is en­throned\" (Rev 2:13). d. Where LXX had already called Job's friends \"kings\" (Job 2:11), TJob makes Job a king too, most strongly at 28:7, \"Jobab, the king of all Egypt.\" The friends speak of him as their \"fellow king\" (29:3), and his throne—mentioned at 20:4— becomes the taunting refrain in the lament of Eliphas (32:2-12): \"Where then is the splendor of your throne?\" Perhaps the canonical Job 19:9 (cf. 31:36)—speaking already in the MT of Job's crown—implies he was there too considered a ruler (cf. 29:25, \"like a king amid his armies . . .\"). 4 a.

Not in LXX, the expression \"consummation of the age\" occurs in the T12P and at Mt 13:39; Heb 9:26. c. Both syntactically and doctrinally, this verse could qualify as a Christian interpolation: even more V's additional phrase \"to eternal life.\" But LXX Job already taught a future resurrection, even apart from the interesting statement in the appendix (42:17a) \"And it is written that he will rise again with those whom the Lord will raise up\" (\". . . whom the Lord raised up\" reads V distinctively at TJob 53:8). Resurrection in 4:9 as well as in 53:8V (and Job 42:17a LXX) seems limited to the right­eous, as in 2Mac 7:14. This contrasts with, e.g., TBenj 10:8, where \"All shall arise—some to glory, and others to dishonor.\" d. This phrase artfully anticipates 27:3-5, where similar athletic imagery marks the end of the episode of Satan and Job. 5 a. According to 6:2 and 9:7f., the doors ordi­narily stood open for the benefit of the poor seeking food. The author has the habit of introducing a major section with a brief advance summary: 5:3 brings on 6-8, while 8:3 announces 9-26. Cf. 46:11 for 48-50. 6 a. Chiastic structure marks this section: 6-8 de­scribe Satan's attack issuing in Job's tragedy, while the closing ch. (27) reverses the matter with Job conquering Satan. Where at 6:1-6 Job secludes himself from Satan, by 27:lf. it is Satan who is hiding from Job. The remaining chs. (9-26) appear to be modeled after the temporal contrast charac­teristic of certain mocking laments: 9-15 tells what Job once was (wealthy, philanthropic, hospitable, musically skilled, pious). Then 16-26 details what he later became (deprived of wealth, family, health). b. Having just razed the idol's temple (5:2), Job conceals himself in his house shutting doors (5:3; 6:2f.) that usually stand open (9:7f.). Coming in disguise as a begger—many such beggers came to Job's house to share in his care for the poor (9:8)— Satan first asked an interview (6:5f.), then a loaf of bread (7:2). Denied both, with Job's assertion of his \"estrangement\" from him (7:4, 10), Satan negotiates authority over Job with God (8:lf.) and discomfits him (8:3). Throughout 6-8, Job is thor­oughly insulated from Satan.

And 2 when he arrived, he spoke to the doormaid saying, •\"Say to Job, 'Give me a loaf 3 of bread from your hands, so I may eat.' \" 'So I gave a burnt loaf of bread to the 4 girl to give to him and said to him, • \"Expect to eat my loaves no longer, for you are estranged from me.\" 5 Then the doormaid, ashamed to give him the burnt and ashen loaf of bread 6 (for she did not know he was Satan), took the good loaf of her own and gave it 23:2; 27:2; 42:2 7 to him. •And when he received it and knew what had occurred he said to the girl, \"Off with you, evil servant. Bring the loaf of bread given you to be given to me.\" 8 The girl wept with deep grief, saying, \"Truly, you well say I am an evil servant. 9 For if I were not, I would have done just as it was assigned to me by my master.\" 20:9 And when she returned, she brought him the burnt loaf of bread, saying to him, 10 \"Thus says my lord, 'You shall no longer eat from my loaves at all, for I have 11 been estranged from you. • Yet I have given you this loaf of bread in order that I may not be accused of providing nothing to a begging enemy.' \"b  47:io; cf. 12 When he heard these things, Satan sent the girl back to me saying, \"As this loaf ^25:21 of bread is wholly burnt, so shall I do to your body also.

And I had a pack c. Satan in disguise appears elsewhere in TJob; 17:2 (as \"king of the Persians\"); 23:1 (as \"bread seller\"). At 20:5 Satan also appeared as a \"great whirlwind.\" The motif serves a literary, rather than a dogmatic, purpose: In each case what Satan becomes suits the requirements of the narrative context. Here, Satan appears as a beggar precisely because it is beggars who gained ready entrance to Job's house (9:8-10:4). TReu 5:6 refers to the fallen angels who were disguised as men. Paul's awareness that Satan disguises himself as an \"angel of light\" leads him to view his opponents as fake aposUes (2Cor 11:13-15). Satan's impersonations may have been among the designs of Satan known to Paul (2Cor2:ll). 7 a. The meaning is unclear, since the word (as-salion) is not found elsewhere in the Gk. of any period. Since it goes on the shoulders, it must be something worn or borne. Possibilities: garment, shawl, wallet, basket, wineskin, water bag, shield. That upon his return with the item Satan asks for bread may suggest it was suited to carrying the bread. Even that might be a garment with roomy folds. b. The phrase possibly reflects Prov 25:21a, \"If your enemy is hungry, give him something to eat; if thirsty, something to drink\" (behind Rom 12:20). 8 a. Job likewise had to obtain authority to raze the idol's shrine (3:6; 4:1). 9 a. Typical Midrashic embellishment character­izes this section magnifying the pious generosities of Job. Job 29 and 31, both LXX (less so Job 30 LXX), clearly inform the author here, supplying numerous details and actual language and illumin­ing several textual problems in TJob 9-15. b. Cf. 10:5.

The figures in P S V all agree in the three places where they are given in TJob (9:2-6/10:5; 16:3; 32:2f.), except for V's two enlarge­ments at 16:3 (\"the multitude\" for \"the seven thousand\") and 32:3 (3,000 for 1,000).

P has likely dropped out the line by a characteristic error in copying, the close proximity of the two occurrences of \"guarding\" in vs. 3. On the dogs, cf. Tob 5:16, 11:4 and see the surprising number of references in L. Ginzberg, Legends of the Jews (Philadelphia, 1967) vol. 7, pp. 115f. d. A reason for this many doors is offered in the talmudic text, ARN 7:1, \"And why did Job make four doors to his house? So that the poor should not have the trouble of going round the entire house. He who came from the north entered straight ahead, and he who came from the south entered straight ahead, and so on all sides. For this reason Job made four doors to his house.\" Job 31:17, 20—which inform TJob 9-10—are also quoted at ARN 7:1. 10 a. This figure is doubled to sixty at 32:7, except for Slav, which reads fifty. Slav also attributes fifty such tables to Sitis (25:5), where P S V read seven. The wife of Job thus shared in his continuous hospitality. b. So 13:4; 14:2; 15:1.

The phrase again draws on the same LXX source, which radically differs from the MT at this point (Job 31:37). 12 a. The words are reminiscent of Paul's \"cheer­ful giver\" (hilaron . . . doten, 2Cor 9:7), using the language of Prov 22:8 LXX, which is a line absent from the Heb. text. b. Basic law at Lev 19:13.

To portray Job's fabulous wealth in cattle, the author utilizes the LXX version of Job 29:6 (cf. TJob 13:2f.) and 31:31 (cf. 13:5f.) drawn from Job's final speech in the dialogue (Job 20:1-31:40)—itself a wishful longing for prior days of affluence and status corresponding in mood to the plaintive tone of TJob 9-15. b. Bountiful milk led to lavish supplies of butter, which is invariably linked with milk (Gen 18:8; Judg 5:25) or honey (2Sam 17:29; Isa 7:15) or both (Deut 32:13f.; Job 17:20) as a token of affluence. c.

Dependence on Job 1:1-4 LXX is evident in 15:1-9: LXX adds the calf to MT, and to the calf TJob adds the list of sacrificial animals (15:4; cf. Job 42:8). Thus in TJob even the domestic piety of Job—resulting in a recurring supply of fresh meat—contributes to his care for the poor. b. TJob follows Job 1:4 LXX in making defi­nitely daily banquets out of the probably annual celebrations mentioned in MT. c.

While patience is the major virtue extolled in TJob, the leading vices it combats are pride (hy­pe rephania, 15:8), contempt (oligdria, 20:1), and arrogance (alazoneia, 21:3). 16 a. This reaction narrates the sequence of Job's losses: in turn, his cattle (16), his children (17-19), his health (20), finally his wife (21-26). The order follows that of the canonical story (Job 1:14-19). Literary exaggeration is used, but with restraint. b. Doing what? Presumably Job is made to refer to the charitable practices just rehearsed in 9-15. c. Chronological details appear elsewhere in the TJob at 21:1; 26:1; 27:6; 28:1, 8; 41:2; 52:1; 53:7; 53:8 S V Slav. Cf. Job 42:16, where MT agrees with LXX (V and S) against LXX (A) and TJob 53:8 S V Slav. According to P, Job spent at least forty-eight years on the dung heap outside the city (21:1). After eleven years (22:1) his bread ration was reduced, producing a famine crisis that would have lasted six years since it was in the seventeenth year (26:1) that Sitis invited Job to blaspheme God and die (26:1). Again according to P, the visiting kings came in the twentieth year (28:1,8), reviewed Job's situation for twenty-seven days (41:2; On this figure P S V agree), after which Job recovered (42:1; 44:1; 47:5-7; but how long is unspecified). P lacks the longer ending of 53:8 found in S, V, or Slav so that this witness is not bound by any length of years for Job's total life span. As for S, it is only by the addition of this longer ending— which resembles Job 42:16—that S varies from P in its chronology. With V the matter is quite other­wise: By omission (28:1 V; cf. 27:6 V) and alter­ation (16:1 V, 22:1 V) a believable seven-year period of testing is ascribed to Job (21:1 V) and uniformly maintained. For V, the spreading of incense took—not three days (as 31:4 P S)—but three hours (31:4 V). V's artistry emerges again in its own version of the longer ending: Only V calculates how long Job lived before his plague (85 years, apparently derived by halving the 170 years that, according to the major LXX MSS, Job lived after his recovery). That V's total for the years Job lived is not the expected sum of 255 but 248 finds V haplessly recording the traditional figure for the length of Job's life. This feature alone should preclude a wrongheaded expectation of chronological perfection in an apocryphon where the interest lies quite beyond mathematical accu­racy. In summary, P's scheme is not really self-contradictory, although it is rather artless and certainly less believable than V's consistent seven-year scheme. S simply accords with P, except for its longer ending. d.

Come along then and gather spoils for yourselves of all his 2:2 animals and whatever he has left on the earth.'' 5 They answered him and said, \"He has seven sons and three daughters. Possibly 1:2 they might flee to other lands and plead against us as though we were tyrants and Job 1:2 in the end rise against us and kill us.\" 6 So he said to them,' 'Have no fear at all. Most of his possessions I have already destroyed by fire. The others I confiscated. And as for his children, I shall slay them.\" 1 18 When he said these things to them, he departed and smashed the house down Job 1:19 2 upon my children and killed them.8 »My fellow countrymen, when they saw that what was said truly happened, pursued and attacked me and began to snatch up 3 everything in my house. »My eyes witnessed cheap and worthless men at my tables and couches.6 4 I was unable to utter a thing; for I was exhausted—as a woman numbed in her 5 pelvic region by the magnitude of birth pangsc—•remembering most of all the battle foretold by the Lord through his angel and the songs of victory which had 4:4 3:i been told to me. 6 dAnd I became as one wishing to enter a certain city to discover its wealth and 17 a. This is the second disguise of Satan—here the \"devil\" (see n. c to 6). Appropriately, only another king could rally opposition to Job \"the king of all Egypt\" (28:7; see n. d to 3). And what better \"king\" (conveniently here left nameless, however) than \"the king of the Persians,\" who in the person of Cyrus (Ezra 1:2-7)—to name but one—had previously shown kindness to the Jews? Disguised thus as a royal benefactor, Satan could appeal to Job's countrymen the more convincingly. Choice of the phrase may reflect the author's conviction that Job lived in the Persian era. See the Introduction above for a possible clue to date of composition furnished by this reference to the king of the Persians. 18 a. Again (as 17:6) Satan is blamed for the tragedy attributed in Job l:18f. to a great wind. b. S here has an unusual longer reading: \"My eyes saw those who make lamps at my tables and couches: Cheap and worthless men they were.\" c. The same simile at IThes 5:3 stresses sud­denness, rather than exhaustion as here. d. The point of this striking parable of the be­leaguered mariner (18:6-8) lies in Job's expressed willingness to see his vast wealth plundered (18:2), buoyed as he is by the hope of eventual improved survival as the angel promised (4:6-11). It is tempt­ing to wonder if the author of TJob may have intended a connection with the promise of 4:9, \"You shall be raised up in the resurrection,\" in a mood similar to Heb 11:8-16 (cf. 12:21f.). Al­though the notion of a heavenly citizenship—with earthbound living thought of as a sojourn—emerges strongly in Christian circles (Phil 3:20; Eph 2:19; Rev 21:2; later Augustine, De civitate dei), Philo speaks similarly (Agr 65). In yet another Alexan­drian piece (4Mac 7:1-3), marine imagery very similar to TJob 18:6-8 occurs. It may be merely coincidental that the same three figures used in TJob 18:4-8 (parturient woman, valued city, beleaguered ship) likewise describe personal distress in one of the Qumran hymns: \"And they made my soul like a ship on the depths of the sea, and like a fortified city before them that besiege it. And I was confined like the woman about to bring forth at the time of her first child-bearing\" (1QH 3.6f.). The other-worldliness motif implied in the parable—relin­quish any worldly goods necessary to reach the destined port—also characterizes Job's psalm of affirmation (33:2-4) and the \"changed hearts\" of his daughters when they were in ecstasy (48:2; 49:1; 50:2)."},{"pageNumber":900,"pageContent":"7 gain a portion of its splendor, -and as one embarked with cargo in a seagoing ship. 4Mac 7:1-3 Seeing at mid-ocean the third wavec and the opposition of the wind, he threw the cargo into the sea, saying, \"I am willing to lose everything in order to enter this 8 city so that I might gain both the ship and things better than the payload.\" •Thus, I also considered my goods as nothing compared to the city about which the angel 3:i spoke to me. 1 19 When the final messenger3 came and showed me the loss of my children, I 2 was deeply disturbed. •And I tore my garments,5 saying to the one who brought 3 the report, \"How were you spared?'' »And then when I understood what had 4 happened I cried aloud, saying, •\"The Lord gave, the Lord tookaway.

This detail of Job's illness seems to be worked into the narrative of TJob (perhaps from there to the LXX interpolation at Job 2:9) from the more poetic plaint of Job at Job 7:5. Worms, which were said to accompany certain cases of illness (Herodotus 4.205; 2Mac 9:9; Josephus, Ant 17.169 • 16.6.5; Acts 12:23; Eusebius, HE 2.10.1; Lu-cian, Alexander 59), became a Jewish, then Chris­tian, eschatological forecast for the ungodly (Isa 66:24; Jdt 16:17; Eccl 7:17; Mk 9:48). It is boils that afflict Job according to the LXX (helkos, Job 2:7) and the MT (S'hin). But TJob speaks of Job as worm-ridden (skolekobrdton to soma). A similar feature appears in Visio Pauli 49 (M. R. James, ed., Apocrypha Anecdota [T&S 2.3; Cambridge, 1893] p. xx). A similar reference appears in ARN, where the relevant passage may be translated,' 'And worms would crawl down him and worms would make holes, holes in his flesh, until one of the worms made a strife with its fellow. What did Job do? He took up one and laid it down upon its hole. And the other he laid down on its hole.\" (S. Schech-ter, ed., Aboth de Rabbi Nathan [New York, 1945] p. 164,11.26-28.) Even more significant, however, is the similar tradition in Tertullian, De patientia 14.2-7 (J. Borleffs, ed., pp. 42f.). In this work-written before he became a Montanist—Tertullian clearly reflects TJob 20:8f. in a vivid, if vulgar, passage: \"How God laughed! How what was al­ready lacerated was the more mangled when, with laughter, he would call the little beasts breaking forth back into the pits and pastures of his furrowed flesh!\" {De patientia, 14.5). So much resembles the passage in ARN just listed; but De patientia shows other parallels to features of the Job story not found in LXX (De patientia 14.2/TJob 1:5; De patientia 14.4/TJob 24:4; 25:10c). It appears war­ranted to conclude Tertullian utilized a Jewish tes­tament praising patience as a source for his own treatment of the same theme."},{"pageNumber":901,"pageContent":"return it to its original place, saying, \"Stay in the same place where you were put until you are directed otherwise by your commander.\"8   7:9   4.

The worm's forced compliance with its or­dained role shows a touch of humor on the part of the author, who elsewhere associates animals and humans by having the cattle mourn over the death of Sitis (20:11; cf. Mk 1:13b). Acquiescence in one's fate has links with a well-known Stoic prin­ciple, \"Fate (heimarmene) is said to be the cause of all that is, the rational principle by which the world is managed (Diogenes Laertius 7.149). The incident of the replaced worms functions as but one more way to extol the virtue of patience. Curiously, while the \"commander\" is in the author's mind assuredly God (cf. 26:4; Job 2:10), it is nevertheless Satan to whom Job's plague was just attributed (20:6; cf. n. a to 18). 21 a. According to the storytelling artistry of the author, Job loses his first wife, Sitis, in three stages. She is first driven to impoverished slavery in order to support Job (21:1—22:2). When her owners re­strict her food supply, she sells her hair to Satan (22:3-23:11). Finally, in a passage closely resem­bling the LXX addition to Job 2:9, she makes a prolonged and embittered speech inviting Job to curse God and die (24; 25:9f.). Her speech is in­terrupted by a poetic lament for Sitis (25:1-8) and followed by Job's \"patient\" response (26). The account of Sitis is resumed and completed in 39f. b.

As in the first disguise, Satan appears to a woman in Job's circle (6:4, to his female servant; 23:2, to his wife). In none of the disguised appearances (6:4; 17:2; 23:2) does Satan encounter Job directly, which leads to Job's challenge for confrontation at 27:1. b. P has simply \"merchant.\" c.

No mention was made at TJob 19:2 of Job's own head-shaving, listed among the grief reactions at Job 1:20. Shaving of the head in TJob is not a sign of grief but of disgrace (23:10; 24:10), as it is also at ICor 11:6: \"In fact, a woman who will not wear a veil ought to have her hair cut off. If a woman is ashamed to have her hair cut off or shaved, she ought to wear a veil.\" The disgrace might arise from cropped hair as (1) a mode of humiliating punishment (Aristophanes, Thesmo-phoreazusae 838: for rearing a cowardly son; or, Tacitus, Germania 19: for adultery) or (2) the practice of female homosexuals (Lucian, Dialogi meretricii 290 = 5.3). 24 a.

Possibly an interpolation, inserted at a log­ical point, just following the report of the reaction of the crowd to the cutting of her hair (24:10). Omission of the lament for Sitis (25:1-8) leaves undisturbed the continuity of the narrative. Inclu­sion of poetic pieces appropriate to narrative context but abruptly inserted without introduction is par­alleled at IMac 1:24-28; 3:3-9, 45; 14:4-15; and Lk 1:14-17, 32f. This lament for Sitis contrasts her former wealth and charity with her present state in a way very similar to the description of Job's pious generosity (TJob 9-15), followed by the recital of his losses (TJob 16-26), and correspond­ing exacUy in form to the lament for Job (TJob 32:2-12). As Job commissioned charitable missions to the poor (9:4f.) and set up free food centers in his own home (10:1-4), Sitis did likewise (25:4f.). While Job's wealth is described in terms of cattle (9:1-6; 10:5; 13:1-3), bakeries (10:7), and jewels (28:5f.), more feminine objects figure in the wealth of Sitis: draperies (25:2), a gold and silver foot basin (25:6), expensive clothing and furniture (25:7f.). Such connections between the descriptions of Sitis and Job argue against viewing 25:1-8 as an interpolation, a point strengthened by the fact that the similar lament for Job (32:2-12) is carefully worked into the prose context (see especially 31:5-32:1; 33:1). The abcb'db\"e . . . pattern, which also characterizes the lament for Job, appears elsewhere in Jewish poetry: most clearly, Ps 136. While the repetition of a line is found in the pure lament form (e.g. 2Sam 1:19, 25, 27; cf. IMac 9:21), the taunting quality of the refrain in the lament for Sitis (25:3-8) more closely parallels the prophetic mocking songs sampled in Rev 18, with its thrice-repeated (18:10, 16-17a, 19) refrain of doom for Babylon. The form of the lament for Sitis thus represents none of the earlier, purer forms of funeral dirges. In fact, the lament is occasioned not by death but by disgrace (as that for Job was occasioned by privation). Since laments were recorded and passed on traditionally (TJob 40:14; 2Sam 1:18; Jer 9:19 [20]; 2Chr 35:35), the appearance of the lament for Sitis at this point in the TJob is not surprising. TJob's own term is a \"royal lament\" (basilikos threnos, 31:7), in which the refrain served for antiphonal response (31:8; 33:1; 43:3). The sharp temporal contrast between what one was and what one has become (in a tragic direction) is used at Ezek 27:32-36. What amounts to an inverse lament—contrasting a former disparaged with a present blessed state—appears in Christian litera­ture (ICor 6:9-11; Tit 3:3-7). b. Variously spelled in P S V and everywhere omitted by Slav. Apparently derived from Ausitis, the LXX translation (Job 1:1; 42:17b, e LXX [A]) for Job's home city, called Uz (cus) in the MT. LXX, but not MT, links Elihu with the same region (Job 32:2 LXX). c. Reflecting TJob's characteristic interest in lex­ical variety, a different word for \"exchange\" is used in the six references (25:3, 4, 5, 6, 8); vs. 7 uses the same term as vs. 6. V assures variety by omitting the refrain (\"Even . . . loaves\") from vs. 6. d.

This second major section of the TJob retains the order of the canonical Job in bringing on the three friends only after the incident with Job's wife. The \"friends\" of MT (Job 2:11) in LXX already became kings (see n. d to 3), a shift shared by TJob. A bit of suspense characterizes this as the preceding and following sections: Only after a series of disguises does Satan meet Job head on (27:If.); only after seven days of silence (28:4), extensive fumigation (31:2-4), and interrogation (31:1; 38:6) are the fellow kings convinced that the tragic figure before them is indeed Job in his right mind; only after donning the charismatic sashes do the daughters—and they alone—get to witness Job's ascent to heaven (47:11; 52:9).

The custom of throwing the earth \"toward heaven\" or on one's head (TJob 29:4;cf. 2Mac 10:25; Jdt9:1; Rev 18:19)may have originated with the conveyance in baskets carried on the head of earth used by grieving relatives to bury a deceased member of the family. e.

Job's patience is contrasted with the absence of that virtue in his friends. g. Such as characterized Job's throne (32:5); cf. the disclaimer that he put his trust in them (Job 31:24 LXX). Josephus (War 2.8.136 = 7.137) reports that the Essenes cherished among their esoteric interests \"the works of the ancients\" wherein \"they study the healing of diseases, the roots offering protection, and the properties of stones.\" BB 16b preserves a tradition that \"Abra­ham had a precious stone hung about his neck which brought immediate healing to any sick person who looked on it.\" But it is not such medicinal values of stones but their proof of wealth which is in view here. Collections of gems (daktuliotheke) existed after Alexander, and the elder Pliny (His-toria naturalis 37.5.11) names the first Roman gem collector (Scaurus). Is Job here portrayed as such a gem collector? Theophrastus (De lapidibus 24.55) refers, with some hesitation, to unspecified records that mention unusually large gems sent to Egyptian kings as gifts from Babylonian kings (24) and that describe royal Egyptian synthetic gem manufacture (55). If gemology was a feature of hellenistic Egyptian royalty, the argument for an Alexandrian provenance for TJob may thereby be strengthened. h. \"You are more noble\" S V. i. This phase may suggest an Egyptian origin for TJob. V's longer reading adds to Job's Egyptian kingdom \"all this territory,\" suggesting V may have known that Ausitis was not to be located in Egypt. The reference to Egypt might also have arisen from the frequent appearance of the word in the T12P, probably well known to the author of TJob. 29 a. Only for Eliphas is the homeland of any of the kings identified in TJob. The ethnic references for the other kings given at Job 2:11 LXX may have been omitted in TJob because Teman was much better known than the other sites (Ezek 25:13; Amos 1:12) and was renowned for its wisdom (Jer 49:7; Obad 8, 9; IBar 3:22f.). III. Job and the Three Kings (28-45)* A. JOB RECOGNIZED AND THE KINGS ASTONISHED (28-30) i,2 28 After I had spent twenty years under the plague, #the kingsb also heard about 21 :i what happened to me. They arose and came to me, each from his own country0 job2:ii-i3 3 so that they might encourage me by a visit. «But as they approached from a distance, they did not recognize me. And they cried out and wept, tearing their 4 garments and throwing dust.d *They sat beside me for seven days and nights. And 29:4; 30:4; 3i:i 5 not one of them spoke to me.c #It was not due to their patiencef that they were 35:4 silent, but because they knew me before these evils when I lived in lavish wealth. . For when I used to bring out for them the precious stones* they would marvel, job 3i:24 clapping their hands, and say, \"If the goods of our three kingdoms were gathered 32:5 into one at the same place, they would be no equal to the glorious stones of your 6 kingdom.\" •For / was more nobleh than those from the east. 7 But when they came to Ausitis asking in the city, \"Where is Jobab, the king ift1*? s of all Egypt?\"1 they said to them about me, '\"He sits on a dung heap outside the 20:7 9 city. For twenty years he has not returned to the city.\" •Then they asked about 21:1 my goods and the things which had befallen me were shown to them. 1 29 When they heard that, they left the city together with the citizens. And my 2o:7 2 fellow citizens showed me to them, «but they remonstrated, saying I was not Jobab. 3 Since they were still quite in doubt, Eliphas—the king of the Temanites*—turned **2:ii"},{"pageNumber":906,"pageContent":"4 to me and said, \"Are you Jobab, our fellow king?\" - And I wept, shaking my 36:i;3:7 headb and throwing dust on it. And I said to them, \"I am indeed.\"0  28:3 3i:6;36:i 1 30 When they saw me shaking my head, they dropped to the ground in a faint. 2 And their troops were disturbed at seeing their three kings collapsed on the ground 3i:8; 34:5 3 as if dead, for three hours. •Then they arose and began saying to one another, 42:3 4 \"We do not believe that this is he!\" 'Then they sat for seven days reviewing my 28:4 5 affairs, recalling my herds and goods and saying, #\"Have we not known about the many good things sent out by him into the cities and the surrounding villages3 to 9:4 be distributed to the poor, besides those established at his house? How then has he now fallen into such a deathly state?\" B. ELIPHAS: LAMENTS JOB'S LOSSES (31-34) Eliphas confirms Job's identity 1 31 And after seven days of such considerations, Eliphas3 spoke up and said to 28:4 his fellow kings, \"Let us approach him and question him carefully to see if it is 35:6 really he himself or not.\" 2 But since they were about a half stadionb distant from me because of the stench0 of my body, they arose and approached me with perfumes in their hands, 32.8; 34:4 3 while their soldiers accompanied them scattering incensed around me so they would 39:8 4 be able to approach me. *And they spent three dayse furnishing the incense. 5 And when they had come near me, Eliphas spoke up and said to me, \"Are you Jobab, our fellow king?f    29:3    Are you the one who once had vast splendor? Are you the one who was like the sun by day in all the land? Are you the one who was like the moon and the stars that shine at midnight?'' 6 And I said to him, \"I am indeed.\"    29:4    A lament of Eliphas for Job 7 And so, after he had wept with a loud wailing, he called out a royal lament 40:14 8 while both the other kings and their troops sang in response.^  30:2 33:i;*43:3; 4*1 b. In both LXX (Job 16:14; Lam 2:15) and NT (Mt 27:39) references to shaking the head refer to scornful derision mounted by others; Job here in pained grief heaps scorn on himself. c. Same language (ego eimi) as used of Jesus in the Gospels. 30 a. P reads \"villages and the surrounding cit­ies.\" The translation follows S V. 31 a. Confusion exists in the textual witnesses between the names of Elihu and Eliphas. P S V here all read Elious. At 29:3 Eliphas appears as the first of the royal interviewers, corresponding with the biblical order. Eliphas should dominate through TJob 34, after which Baldad appears. Indeed Eliphas is named at 34:2, 5 by P S V. Yet the same witnesses all read Elious at 31:1, 5; 32:1 (also 33:1 P S). Possibly, Elious (Elihu probably is intended) is a sort of pseudo-Satan figure standing behind and inspiring Eliphas (cf. 41:5; 42:2) so that either may be said to be the originator of the insulting words. This translation adopts the con­jecture of Riessler (p. 1334) reading Eliphas for Elihu at 31:1, 5; 32:1; 33:1, thereby unifying 29-34 as an Eliphas section. Eliphas at 31:1, at least, appears in the recently discovered 5th cent. A.D. Cop. translation of the TJob, Papyrus Colon 3221. b. About 304 feet. c. 2Mac 9:9-12 says the terminal illness of Antiochus IV was accompanied by worms and by an odor so revulsive to his troops that he could not be carried. d. But without magical connotations of fumi­gation such as appear with the apotropaic effects of a smoke contrived from the heart and liver of a fish; cf. Tob 6:8. e. V has \"three hours.\" f. The questions anticipate the poetic lament in ch. 32. g. Antiphonal singing also at TJob 43:3; 44:1, but the references are absent in V at 31:8; 44:1. The refrains of the hymns at TJob 25, 32,33,43:4, 17 suit remarkably Philo's remark that the Thera­peutae use traditional as well as newly composed hymns, at times joining in on \"the last lines or the refrains\" (Vita com 80)."},{"pageNumber":907,"pageContent":"32 a. Possibly a development of a line at Job 29:20 LXX, \"My splendor was newly upon me.\" b. \"For the children\" in P, a change calling only for an additional iota (paisin for pasiri). c. S here adds \"Where then is the splendor of his throne?\" Use of the third person pronoun, in contrast to the second person refrain throughout the lament itself, may suggest S used the phrase as a title for the lament. d. The question that introduces the refrain may be translated, with equal grammatical warrant, as an assertion tinged with sarcasm: \"You are the one who appointed 7,000 sheep for the clothing of the poor: Where then is the splendor of your throne?\" and similarly throughout 32:2-12. e. Equivalent to the \"500 yoke\" mentioned at 10:5; 16:4; Job 1:3. f. Sitis also was said to have had couches of gold and silver; cf. 25:8. Cf. Job's golden lamps on silver stands (32:9) and Sitis' clothing of gold-woven linen (25:7). g. S. P reads \"sits on the road.\" h. This verse closely parallels in thought, if not in language. Job 29:5 LXX (lines reversed), a favorite source for the author: \"When I was very fruitful and my children surrounded me . . .\" i. The Qumran hymns speak often (1QH 6:15; 7:19; 8:6, 8, 10) of the \"sprout\" (neser), but apparently as a self-designation for their own community drawn from Isa 11:1; 60:21. Some of these passages have been taken to refer to the Teacher of Righteousness and thus to a revered individual, as here (TJob 32:6) to Job. j. S omits vs. 6. The obvious difference in style suggests these lines may have been added later. k. But thirty according to 10:1—with twelve more for widows (10:2)—while Sitis is credited with seven (25:5). Slav evens the count, reading \"fifty\" for both Job (32:7) and Sitis (25:5). 1. The text is uncertain. References to Job's use of censers, lamps (32:9), and frankincense (32:10) appear to ascribe to him prerogatives held only by priests (cf. 2Chr 26:16-21). Use here of \"assem­bly\" (ekklesia) may derive from Job 30:28 (\"I stand up in the assembly\" RSV), where Job contrasts his present cry for help with his former honored status in the city gate (Job 29:7-25, especially 29:7). It is difficult to say whether the assembly in view is cultic, juridical (as would suit Job 29:7-25), or even military (as TJob 31:2-4). m. The parallelism here, which continues that in the two preceding verses, shows that the frank­incense (libanos) is here a token of costliness, as it was in the two NT occurrences (Mt 2:11; Rev 18:13). See G. Van Beek, \"Frankincense and Myrrh,\" BA 23 (1960) 70-95. n. The word joke (chleue) appears nowhere in LXX, but possibly stems from Job 12:4 LXX, \"For a just and blameless man has become the object of mockery (chleuasma).,t The idea, how­ever, appears in the favored LXX source at Job 30:9; 31:30; cf. 30:1; 17:6. 1 32 Hear then the lament3 of Eliphas as he celebrates for allb the wealth of Job:c 2 \"Are you the one who appointed 7,000 sheep for the clothing of the poor?*1 9:3 Where then is the splendor of your throne? Are you the one who appointed 3,000 camels for the transport of goods to 9:4 the needy? Where then is the splendor of your throne? 3 Are you the one who appointed the thousand*5 cattle for the needy to use iu:5 when plowing? Where then is the splendor of your throne? 4 Are you the one who had golden couchesf but now sits on a dung heap? 25:8 Now where is the splendor of your throne? 5 Are you the one who had a throne of precious stones, but now sits in 28:5 ashes?« Now where is the splendor of your throne? 6  hWho opposed you when you were in the midst of your children?

Now I will show you my throne with the splendor of its majesty, which is among the 43:6 holy ones.d     43:10     3  e\"My throne is in the upper world/ and its splendor and majesty come from the right hand of the Father.8 4 'The whole world shall pass awayh   33:4   and its splendor shall fade. And those who heed it shall share in its overthrow. 5 But my throne is in the holy land,1 and its splendor is in the world of the 7 changeless oneJ    36:5    o. This vs. is found only in P, which—though it uses \"Job\" here—employs the name Jobab at 31:5 (and Job again at 33:2). At 25:1, the very similar taunting lament uses the name of Job's wife; cf. \"Elihu\" at 43:5, 17. Thus of the four poetic pieces in TJob, three are directed against named individuals. 33 a. Directly responding to the reproachful re­frain in Eliphas' mocking lament, Job asserts in this psalm of affirmation (TJob 33:3-9) his alle­giance to the supramundane (hyperkosmios, 33:3), heavenly realm where—contrary to transient earthly reigns (33:8)—he has an eternal kingdom (33:9). In form, the seven-part poem alternates between four assertions of the supercosmic permanence of his \"throne\" (33:3, 5, 7, 9) and three evenly interspersed derogations of mundane transience (33:4,6,8). Each of the positive statements contains some variation of \"my throne,\" which is reminis­cent of the refrain characteristic of the two earlier poems (TJob 25, 32). The ascription of a heavenly throne to a revered figure is a frequent hagiographic technique in the literature of the period (Mt 19:28b = Lk 22:30, and cf. Mt 20:21; Rev 4:4; 11:16; 20:4; neo-Heb. examples in H. Odeberg, 3 Enoch or the Hebrew Book of Enoch [Cambridge, 1928, repr. 1973] p. 27, note to 3En 10:1, where Enoch has just such a throne set for him as he is proclaimed Metatron). But the rabbis felt anyone seated in heaven gives affront to the Holy One (Hag 15a). Job's claim to have a throne at the Father's right is thus a daring one. b. Only V so reads. P has Elihu and S, Elious. See n. a to 31. c. Dropping the first person, P reads \"Job said.\" d. A striking resemblance to the Qumran concept of die fellowship of the just with the angels (e.g. 1QH 3.21-23; 4.24f.; 11.10-12; 1QS 11.709; lQSa 2.8f.) elsewhere in TJob expressed in his daughters' charismatic access to the language of the angels (48:3; 49:2; 50:2). Among the harsh (excommu-nicative?) judgments invoked on Elihu was the loss of such fellowship: \"And the holy ones abandoned him\" (43:10). Exactly as the Qumran members were themselves called \"men of holiness\" (1QS 8.17, 23; 9.8; cf. 8.20), so may \"the holy ones\" now rejoice at the discomfiture of Elihu (43:15; cf. 43:14). The whole of the hymn against Elihu (TJob 43:4-17), in fact, is replete with Qumran affinities. e. T*iis vs. follows 33:4 in V. f. Neither LXX nor MT uses this term (hyper-kosmios), which first appears in 5th cent. Christian (Cyril of Alexandria) or pagan (Iamblichus) mys­tical authors. g. Only P reads \"Father\" here. S has \"God\" and V reads \"Savior.\" S V speak of \"the Father in the heavens.\" S V Slav add the line \"My throne is eternal.\" Surprisingly, the phrase \"from the Father's right hand\" is not readily paralleled in the biblical tradition (MT, LXX, NT) though the tendency apparent at Acts 2:33 and Eph 1:17, 20 emerges clearly in later Christian examples, in­cluding exacUy this phrase in a variant reading for Mk 16:19 (quoting Ps 109 [1101:1). The wide NT use of Ps 109 (110):1 regularly appears with \"Lord\" (as LXX), \"God,\" or a circumlocution such as \"power\" (Mt 26:64; but note conflation at Lk 22:69:' 'at the right hand of the Power of God' *) or \"majesty\" (Heb 1:3; 8:1). \"Father\" is used of God nationally already at such places as Isa 63:16; 64:8; Mai 1:6; 2:10, and of God as the Father of individuals at least since Eccl 23:4 (cf. 23:1): \"Lord Father and God of my life . . .\" h. Both NT parallels (ICor 7:31; Un 2:17) use the present tense. Cf. Did 10:6: \"Let grace come and this world pass on.\" i. ' 'The holy land'' as early as Zech 2:16; WisSol 12:3; 2Mac 1:8 refers to the promised land. But it is apparently not until Origen (Contra Celsum 7:29) that the term is used metaphorically of heaven, though the meaning might be anticipated in such places as Mt 5:5: \"The gentle . . . shall have the earth for their heritage.\" One motif in intertesta­mental literature is the special privilege that attaches to those who live in Palestine (Joel 2:32; 4Ezra 13:48f.; 2Bar 29:3; 40:2). Charles, in a note to 2Bar 29:2 (Apocalypse of Baruch [London, 1896] pp. 51f.), summarizes rabbinic notions that (1) of three who will inherit the coming world, one is he who lives in Israel (Pes 113a); (2) leaving Israel forfeits the accumulated merit of the fathers (BB 91a); (3) he who dies in the Holy Land will rise first in the resurrection (Jalkut Shimeoni; Bereshit 130); and (4) the righteous dead, if they are to participate in the resurrection, would have to roll through un­derground passageways to Palestine (Ket 111a). j. S V have \"the unchangeable world.\" Paral­lelism with \"Father\" in 33:3, 9 suggests \"the changeless one\" here is a tide for God, but there seems no firm reason to associate the title with a similar expression for an eon (\"endless and un-"},{"pageNumber":909,"pageContent":"Eliphas' rejoinder i,2 34 As I was saying these things to them so they would be quiet, •Eliphasa became enraged and said to the other friends, \"What good has it done that we have come 3 here with our armies to comfort him? •Look, now he accuses us!

BALDAD TESTS JOB'S SANITY (35:1-38:5) 1 35 Then Baldad seized hima and said, \"One should not speak that way to a man 2 who not only is in mourning but also is beset by many plagues. -Take note: Although we are quite healthy, we were not strong enough to approach him because 31.2-4 3 of the foul stench, except by the use of much perfume. *You there, Eliphas, do 4 you forget how you were when you fell illb for two days? «Now then, let us be patient in order that we may discover his true condition.

The term \"forever\" (eis to dienekes)—found in Heb 7:3; 10:1, 12, 14—is not elsewhere used in NT or LXX, but the 2nd-cent. A.D. historian Appian uses it to say Julius Caesar was made dictator \"forever\" (Bella civilia 1.4). 1. I.e. transient. The same feature (not opacity) characterizes the mirrors of ICor 13:12 and Jas 1:23. m. This remarkable phrase, \"the chariots of the Father,\" is attested in P S V, while \"Father\" is used elsewhere of God only by P (33:3; 40:2; 47:11 [possibly of God here also]; 52:12). The textual validity of \"Father\" at 33:3 draws some strength from its appearance here; for the result then has the term \"Father\" artfully arranged in the first and last units of the poem, in each of which Job says his splendor and majesty are associated with the \"Father.\" The passage is commonly connected with the so-called Merkabah mysticism (mystical speculation about the \"chariots\" [mrkbwt] of God thriving on the fringe of hellenistic Judaism through and beyond NT times). Such speculations appear in a minor sectarian document from Qumran. Called the \"Angelic Liturgy\" (4Q$ir£abb 37-40), these fragmentary texts suggest an order of worship merging angelic cultic actions with the liturgy of the Qumran covenanters. But in contrast with these Qumran fragments, TJob has no sevenfold heaven nor is it even concerned with ecstatic descriptions of the throne or chariot as 4Q$ir§abb 40. In fact, TJob 33:9 asserts yet again the supramundane permanence of Job's own throne—not God's—by locating it with \"the chariots of the Father.\" Perhaps an Alexandrianized early Merkabah tra­dition lies behind this unusual phrase. 34 a. Here, as not since 29:3, triply attested in P S V. Seen, a to 31. b. P has \"administrations.\" 35 a. Seized Eliphas, that is, who according to 34:5 was about to leave. S V Slav add \"by the hand.\" b. There is no canonical reference to the illness of Eliphas, which may have been occasioned by the stench of Job's sickness. c. The Gk. of chs. 35-38 shows a rich vocab­ulary for mental (in)stability which taxes the trans­lator's ingenuity. The section may have been in­formed by Job 36:28b LXX: \"In all these things your understanding was not deranged nor was your mind disturbed in your body.\" 6 •Rivers will dry up,      Job i4:ii and the arrogance of their waves goes down into the depths of the abyss. 7 But the rivers of my land, where my throne is, do not dry up nor will they 5 disappear, but they will exist forever.* 8 •These kings will pass away, and rulers come and go; but their splendor 34:4 and boast shall be as in a mirror.1 9 But my kingdom is forever and ever, and its splendor and majesty are in the chariots of the Father.\"\"1     52:6.8.10"},{"pageNumber":910,"pageContent":"1 36 Then Baldad, when he had arisen, approached me and said, \"Are you Job?\" 29:3 And I said to him, \"Yes.\"     29:4     2 And he said, \"Is your heart untroubled?\" 3 And I said to him, \"My heart is not fixed on earthly concerns, since the earth 48:2; 49:i; 50.2 and those who dwell in it are unstable. But my heart is fixed on heavenly concerns, 47:3 for there is no upset in heaven.\"8 4 And Baldad replied and said, \"We know the earth is unstable, since of course 33:4 it changes from time to time.

And if you answer me calmly, it will be clear that you are not emotionally disturbed.\" 1 37 So he said, \"In whom do you hope?\"3 2 And I said, \"In the God who lives.\" 3 And again he said to me, \"Who destroyedb your goods or inflicted you with these plagues?\" 4 And I said, \"God.\"               4:3.5               5 And again he replied and said, \"Do you hope upon God? Then how do you reckon him to be unfair0 by inflicting you with all these plagues or destroying your 6 goods? *If he were to give and then take away, it would actually be better for him not to have given anything. At no time does a king dishonor his own soldier who bears arms well for him. Or who will ever understand the deep thingsd of the Lord 7 and his wisdom? Who dares to ascribe to the Lord an injustice? • Answer me this, Job. 8 \"And again I say to you, if you are sound of mind and have your wits about you, tell me why we see the sun on the one hand rising in the east and setting in the west, and again when we get up early we find it rising again in the east? Explain these things to me if you are the servant of God.\"e 1 38 And to all this I said, \"I do have my wits about me, and my mind is sound. Why then should I not speak out the magnificent things of the Lord?8 Or should 36 a. The gist of Job's response—his alliance with the stable \"heavenly concerns\"—accords with the central theme of his psalm of affirmation (TJob 33). There it was his throne, here it is his mind (kardial pseuche). There it was the supramundane (hyper-kosmios), here it is the \"heavenlies\" (epourania). With this relate the glossolalic participation of Job's daughters in the same upper world (TJob 48:3; 49:2; 50:2). The whole motif, furthermore, may be com­pared to the postresurrectional understanding of Christian existence implied in Col 3: If.: \"Since you have been brought back to true life with Christ, you must look for the things that are in heaven, where Christ is, sitting at God's right hand. Let your thoughts be on heavenly things, not on the things that are on the earth.\" b. Putting riddles follows a typical wisdom motif (cf. H. Torczyner, \"The Riddle in the Bible,\" HUCA 1 [1924] 125-49). Job has his own riddle to ask, 38:3f. 37 a. The question—now sincere, not rhetorical— may arise from Job 17:15 LXX: \"Where then is my hope?\" The longer recension of Tob—reflected in the Vulgate as well as in the Heb. and Aram, fragments of Tob from Qumran—says Tobit's misfortune happened \"so that the example of his patience might be given to posterity, just as was also that of sainUy Job\" (Tob 2:12 Vulgate; cf. Jas 5:11: \"You have heard of the patience of Job''). The same passage (not paralleled in the shorter Gk. recension) also shows very high similarities with certain elements in the TJob: \"For just as the kings would mock blessed Job, so also those who were subject to him and his kin would laugh at his way of life, saying, 'Where is your hope? To what end did you give alms and perform burial rites?' \" (Tob 2:15f. Vulgate). b. God here, but Satan at 4:3-5. c. The text is corrupt. P reads \"How then can he be unfair by inflicting . . .?\" Kraft conjectures, \"How then does he act unjustly when he judges, inflicting . . .?\" d. This phrase is closer to NT expressions (ICor 2:10) than to anything in LXX (but cf. Dan 2:22 LXX, \"the deep and dark things\"). e. In LXX (e.g. 1:8; 2:3), Job is frequently called the \"servant\" (ho therapon) of God. S V Slav omit the \"if clause. 38 a. The phrase \"the magnificent things (ta me-galeia) of the Lord\" has been suggested as the title of a collection of angelic hymns. If so, Job appears here (38:If.) to say that recital of angelic hymns, while entirely open to him in full possession of his mental powers, is inappropriate as a dem­onstration of sanity. Rather, he will show mental acuity in a way that will not offend the Lord, by"},{"pageNumber":911,"pageContent":"my mouth utterly blunder regarding the Master?b Never! #Who are we to be busying ourselves with heavenly matters, seeing that we are fleshly, having our lot in dust 5 Job30:i9 and ashesT \"Now then, so you may know that my heart is sound, here is my question for you: Food enters the mouth, then water is drunk through the same mouth and sent into the same throat.

SITIS: LAMENTS HER CHILDREN, DIES, AND IS BURIED (39-40)3 39 While I was saying these things to them, my wife Sitis arrived in tattered 25:7 garments, •fleeing from the servitude of the official she served, since he had forbidden her to leave lest the fellow kings see her and seize her. #When she came, she threw herself at their feet and said weeping, '\"Do you remember me, Eliphas— you and your two friends—what sort of person I used to be among you and how I used to dress? 'But now look at my debut and my attire!\"b  25:7  asking a counterriddle—which baffles Baldad (38:3f.). \"The great things\" refers, in LXX, to the mighty deeds of God, chiefly those displayed at the Exodus (Deut 11:2; Ps 105 [106]:21). They were to be recited widely (Ps 70 [71]: 19; Eccl 36:7). So the \"mighty deeds\" became a praiseful recital of the acts of God. Luke uses the same phrase to describe the content of glossolalia heard on the Day of Pentecost (Acts 2:11; cf. 10:46, \"Since they could hear them speaking strange languages and proclaiming the greatness [megalu-nouton] of God\"). As the companion of Paul, who himself knew of tongues of angels (ICor 13:1), Luke, with Paul, may have been aware of some tradition linking the glossolalic praise of God with angelic hymnody. While there is not sufficient evidence to say either Luke or Paul knew of the TJob, the concern of all three with prophetic experience at once ecstatic and angelic brings them closer together on this point than any other contem­porary texts. b. ' 'Master'' (despotes) appears only here in the TJob. Cf. Job 5:8 LXX: \"Lord and Master of all.\" c. This view of the \"nothingness\" of mankind, which permits neither ability nor right to meddle in heavenly matters, is frequently expressed; it constitutes the thrust of the God speeches in Job 38:1-41:25 (cf. especially Job's response at 42:3b, \"I have been holding forth on matters I cannot understand, on marvels beyond me and my knowl­edge\"). See further the conversations concluded by 4Ezra 4:10f., 21 and Jn 3:12. TJob sees no conflict between this anthropological abnegation— reflected here in Job's own words—and Job's earlier claim that he sides with the \"heavenlies\" (36:3). d. Neither P, S, nor V adopts a euphemism for * 'latrine'' as Codex Bezae does for Mk 7:19 (= Mt 15:17, only here in NT) by reading (\"sewer, drain,\" ochetos). e. \"Foresight\" in S. f. Sophar's denial that he and his friends were exploring inscrutables shows that the gist of Job's remarks (38:1-5) was a caution against such spec­ulation. g. The text is uncertain. h. In the ongoing narrative, Job's healing is not detailed, though it must have occurred during the appearance of God to Job \"through a hurricane and clouds\" (42:1). Later (47:4-9), the effects of the healing and the role of Job's charismatic phylactery are recalled. 39 a. TJob 39f. resume and complete the Sitis episode earlier treated at 21-26.

Jewish funereal interests apparent here are illustrated at Tob 1:17-19 and Eccl 38:16-23. Here, as also TJob 19:2; 20:4; 53:1-4, it is a question of sincere and traditional laments (even if, fantastically, the animals share in the lamenta­tion, 40:10!), and not the mocking laments of TJob 25:1-8 and 32:1-12. See also n. d to 28. d. This sign of royalty was placed even about idols (LetJer 6:11, 71; cf. Jn 19:2, 5). e. Body and soul, apparently, since (1) the search for bones would be fruitless (39:11) and (2) it is the children, not their souls, or spirits, merely, that have been taken to heaven (39:12f.; 40:3). Yet this seems to contradict the account of Job's demise, where although his soul was borne off in a chariot to the east (42:10), his body was at once prepared (53:11) and buried after three days \"in a beautiful sleep\" (53:7). At the outset of the story, the angel had promised Job would be raised up in the resurrection (4:9; see n. c to 4), an echo (or source?) of Job 42:17a LXX. Though nothing direct is said of the future of the wicked in the TJob, the hymn against Elihu (TJob 43) speaks more of banishment, of separation from the \"holy ones,\" than it does of extinction or of consignment to any special abode of the wicked dead, either with or without a resurrection. (See 43:5, 6, 10.) Except for the assumption of the children, the view of life after death expressed in these passages in TJob is not unlike that of Jub 23:28-31; lEn 91:10; 92:3; 103:3f.; TAb B 7, in which the bones and the bodies rest in the earth but the spirits rise in conscious joy. If the ascent to heaven of the children (leaving no bones behind!) seems inconsistent with the other references, it is only because TJob reflects a stage in the development of Jewish eschatology where considerable diversity appeared. Compared to Qumran thought, TJob openly asserts (as 4:9) the resurrection of the righteous, where Qumran (e.g. 1QH 3.19) tacitly assumes it, or, by virtue of intense eschatological immediacy, obviates it. TJob never reaches (at best, 43) the execratory vocabulary of damnation for the wicked character­istic of the Qumran texts (e.g. 1QS 4.11-14). Finally, Qumran knows nothing comparable to the bodily assumption into heaven, following death, of Job's deceased children. While ancient worthies such as Elijah (without death, 2Kgs 2:9 LXX), Abraham (TAb B 7), Paul (before death, 2Cor 12:2, 4) were said to have been \"taken up\" (analambaneinlanalempsis; for 2Cor, harpazein), the ascension of Jesus (Acts 1:11) should not be overlooked in this case. With Jesus, there was no discussion about body and/or soul, whereas Paul twice (2Cor 12:2f.) wondered if he were \"in the body\" during the ascent. The model of Jesus— ascension after death, consequent to resurrection— may betray a Christian hand somewhere in the editorial history of TJob. f. TJob employs some unusual divine titles: \"the great God\" (17:4); \"Master\" (despotes) (38:1); \"the Master of virtues\" (50:2); \"the Creator\" (demiourgos) and \"King\" here at 39:12. \"Creator\" (demiourgos) is used in NT only at Heb 11:10. None of the later gnostic contempt for the term \"creator\" appears here. g. V reads for the quotation, \"for when we were about to recover the bones of your children, you forbad us, saying, 'They have been gathered up and are kept by their Creator.' \" 40 a. So P; \"I sang praises first to the Lord and to God'' S;\" . . .to God first'' V. Kraft conjectures \"I first gave thanks to the Lord.\" On \"Father\" in TJob, see n. g to 33. Cf. singing praises to the Father with a similar line in the speculative hellen­istic theosophic tract Poimandres 1.26, which says of the climax of the ascended soul upon its arrival at the eighth sphere, \"And it sings (hymnei) to the Father with those who are there.\""},{"pageNumber":913,"pageContent":"your eyes to the eastb and seec my children crownedd with the splendor of the 52: io 43: M heavenly one.\"e 4 And when she saw that, Sitis my wife fell to the ground worshiping and said, 21:2 \"Now I know that I have a memorial with the Lord.

At least at Lk 1:78, the \"east\" (anatole) had messianic connotations. Literal aid from the east—fellow Jews in Babylon—was re­called in IBar 4:36; 5:5. Josephus (War 2.128 = 2.8.5) mentions the prayers of the Essenes directed toward the sun; and according to Athanasius, Quaestiones ad Antiochum 37 (PG 28.620A), the Jews prayed toward the east. Christian practices in patristic times included baptizing toward the east and orienting churches in that direction. Contrast the north-south orientation of most graves at Qum­ran. c. S V Slav have \"when they looked, they saw.\" d. The anticipated future of the sons of truth, according to 1QS 4.7, includes \"the glorious crown\" (kill kdbSd). e. V has \"the heavenly king.\" f.

Probably the city folk, but possibly the mourn­ing animals of vs. 11. i. Sympathetic participation of animals is an occasional feature of certain popular sectarian lit­erature: the cooperative worm (20:9); Ignatius (Rom 4:2) seeks the aid of beasts in becoming the \"pure bread of Christ\"; cf. Mk 1:13, Jesus with the wild beasts; and 2En 58:6, where beasts are said to survive to accuse their abusers. (See an extensive n. to 2En 58:6 regarding Jewish and Greek notions of the rationality of animals in Charles, APOT, vol. 2, p. 464. j. Vss. 9-11 show considerable disarray in the text witness.

Parallels at 49:3 and 50:3 suggest \"The Spirit\" as atitleat48:4. \"The Great Things\" (51:3; cf. 38:1; 51:4) could be yet another such title (see n. a to 38). The principle is anticipated by numerous \"lost\" books mentioned in the canonical literature (Num 21:14; Josh 10:13 MT; 2Sam 1:18; IKgs 11:41; 14:19, 29; 15:7; IChr 29:29; 2Chr 9:29; 12:15; 20:34; 26:22; 33:18f.; 35:25.

In the canonical Job, Elihu makes a very graphic and explicit claim to inspiration: \"For I am filled with words, choked by the rush of them within me. I have a feeling in my heart like new wine seeking a vent, and bursting a brand-new wineskin. Nothing will bring relief but speech, I will open my mouth and give my answer\" (Job 32:18-20; cf. 32:8, \"But now I know that it is a breath in man, the inspiration of Shaddai, that gives discernment\"). While the biblical book at­tributes the inspiration to God (Job 32:8), TJob ascribes it to Satan (41:5; cf. 42:2). d. See n. 1 to 40. The words of Elihu are preserved in the records of Eliphas perhaps because Elihu is the subject of execration (TJob 43) and any invitation to consult his own records would be inappropriate. 42 a. A less restrained apocryphon may well have easily or fabulously amplified this event mentioned at Job 38:1. b. Beyond his speech, nothing is heard of Elihu in the canonical book. c. Cf. 23:2; 27:2, all of which attest a developed yet restrained view of Satan not unlike that of NT (e.g. Eph 2:2). d. V omits the whole verse. S reads \". . . the cloud, they heard.\" e. TJob 42:4-8 slightly compresses Job 42:7-9 LXX, with the following differences: (1) LXX (42:7) says the kings did not speak the truth as Job did—TJob (42:5) says they did not speak truly regarding (kata) Job; (2) LXX (42:8) speaks of seven bullocks and seven rams, TJob (42:6) merely of \"sacrifices\"; (3) the names of the kings (42:9) in LXX are omitted in TJob (42:9; but cf. 28:4 V, where V has the names); (4) unusually, TJob in one or two cases does not follow the Alexandrian text of LXX. 43 a. P reads \"Eliphas received a spirit. . .\" (or \"the Spirit\"?) P here omits \"holy\" before \"spirit,\" but includes it at 51:2. The activity of the spirit here is associated with speaking (or singing) the hymn (cf. ICor 14:15; Eph 5:18f.), but not with the inspiration of composing the hymn. Describing the hymn composition of the Therapeutae, Philo mentions no \"spirit\" (Vita cont 29.80). On the other hand, the Holy Spirit (according to 51:2 P; S has \"holy angel,\" V omits) is present in Nereus' recording of the hymns (51:2 P). \"Spirit\" as inspiring agent is clear in such Jewish literature as lEn 91:1; Martls 1:7; 5:14; TAb A 4; and 4Ezra 14:22. But in none of these examples is it a matter of hymn composition. But cf. Job's query of Baldad, found at Job 26:4 LXX: \"Whose breath is it that has come forth from you?\" b. See n. g to 31. Philo (Vita cont 80) identifies among the hymns of the Therapeutae those that were sung at the altar, as here and at 44:1, where in view is the altar where the sacrifices had just been offered by Job for his fellow kings (42:6-43:3). c. Eliphas, as the leading one of the visiting kings, gives the hymn. He also is the only one identified as to homeland (29:3); was first to speak upon the kings' discovery of Job (29:3); and was first to be addressed by Sitis (39:4). d. This hymn (43:4-17) is an imprecatory exe­cration text given, according to TJob, at the altar when it became clear Elihu did not share in the forgiveness just mediated through Job's sacrificial offices (42:5-43:3). Something like a refrain ap­pears as the opening and closing lines (43:4, 17); it is not impossible the refrain originally appeared in alternation with the remaining verses so as to approximate the form of the laments in TJob 25, 32 (see n. g to 25). Some parallels with other material in TJob appear: e.g. cf. 43:10 with 33:2"},{"pageNumber":915,"pageContent":"(for use of Job 18 LXX, see n. g to 43). Yet much of the language of the psalm is distinctive and its affinities with Qumran hymnody have been noted by Philonenko (\"Le Testament de Job,\" Sem 18 [1968] 52f.). Even though it belongs to a consid­erably later period (5th to 6th cent, A.D.), a striking parallel is afforded by the Cop. gnostic apocryphon entitled Book of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ by Bartholomew the Apostle (ResBart). This text contains an execration against Judas Iscariot said to have been pronounced by Jesus in \"Amente,\" an Egyptian mythological term for hell, where Jesus went following death and prior to resurrection and where he found Judas Iscariot. Both the Elihu hymn and the Judas invective (1) are poetic in form, (2) appear in the third person, (3) amount to an excommunicative curse, and (4) are uttered against a named individual. Striking conceptual similarities appear in the following paired excerpts (utilizing the present translation of TJob and, for ResBart, that of E. Budge, Coptic Apocrypha [London, 1913] p. 185; Cop. text, pp. 7-9 with plates VII-IX; excerpts from TJob are in textual sequence, those from ResBart are not): TJob 43:5 Elihu . . . will have no me­morial among the living ResBart  Judas' inheritance has been taken away from among the living TJob 43:5 his quenched lamp lost its luster ResBart  the light departed and left him, and darkness came upon him TJob 43:7 His kingdom is gone, his throne is rotted, and the honor of his tent lies in Hades ResBart  his crown has been snatched away ... the worm has in­herited his substance ... his house hath been left a desert TJob 43:8 He loved the beauty of the snake and the scales of the dragon. Its venom and poison shall be his food. ResBart  His mouth was filled with thirty snakes so that they might devour him The Elihu hymn shows more literary finesse; it begins and ends with a similar couplet, for example. But both hymns must arise from the same literary stock, the roots of which reach through Job 18 LXX as far back as the \"mocking dirges\" in Isa 14 and Ezek 28. e. Close the the Christian title for Satan, \"the Evil One,\" which occurs at TJob 7:1 V; 20:2 V; cf. Mt 13:19 and 6:13. f. The frequency of the expression \"no memor­ial\" in TJob (24:2; 39:8; 40:4; 43:5, 17) was anticipated by its occurrence at Job 18:17 LXX (cf. Job 2:9 with TJob 24:2 and see n. c to 24). With whom the \"memorial\" occurs varies: the earth (24:2; Job 2:9b), the living (43:5, 17), the Lord (40:4), or no such reference (39:8). g. The themes and the language of 43:5f. appear in the LXX poem of Job: the vanished memorial (Job 18:17); the quenched lamp (Job 18:5f.; 21:17; 29:3); light/darkness motifs (Job 12:25; 17:12; 18:6, 18; 23:11; 26:10). Baldad's derisive description of the ungodly (Job 18:2-21 LXX), in particular, seems to inform TJob 43:5f. h. The ill end of Elihu's \"splendor and majesty'' (vs. 6) and of his \"throne\" (vs. 7) contrast with the heavenly, supramundane character of Job's kingdom and throne (33:2, 3, 5, 9). i.

Eliphas, Baldad, and Sophar are thus forgiven and they may, with the \"holy men,\" rejoice (43:15). But Elihu now stands under divine judg­ment, excluded from the group; he is not again heard of in TJob. 44 a. One expects at this point, or earlier, some description of Job's healing. But none is given, although 47:2-9 recounts how his recovery was effected through a triple-stranded band, or sash, Midrashically derived from a literal interpretation of the biblical injunction, \"Gird your loins like a man\" (Job 38:3; 40:7 RSV). The band is then split into three parts and given to the daughters as their inheritance. b. Reference is made either probably to the unnamed city of the region of Ausitis (TJob 28:7 and Job 1:1; 42:17b, e A) or possibly to the city the angel mentioned (TJob 18:8). c. TJob 44:3-5 restyles Job 42:10-12 so as to reflect Job's charitable deeds detailed earlier at TJob 9-15. d. Lit. a \"tetradrachma of gold.\" V makes it an alloy: \". . .of gold and silver.\" Cf. Job 42:11 LXX B, \"a tetradrachma of uncoined gold.\" e. V completes the verse with a characteristic and lengthy reading: \"and within a few days I abounded in goods and cattle and the remaining things which I had lost. And I gained others in double quantity. And I took a wife, your mother, and I fathered the ten of you in lieu of my ten children who had died.\" 45 a. This paragraph is typical of the close of the usual \"testament\": the death scene, exhortations to the children, summary injunctions. But the death itself is not described (till 52:1-53:8), and there is no concern to take the bones back to Hebron (found in all T12P). b. The essentially Jewish ban against foreign marriage has been widely recognized. From biblical roots (Gen 24:3, 37; 27:46-28:1; Num 36:8; Ezra 10:10; cf. Gen 26:34f.), it has spread to such texts as JosAsen 8:5; Tob 1:9; 3:15; 4:12f.; 6:10-12 (pre-eminenUy); Jub 20:4; 22:20; 25:1-10; 30:7-17; TLevi 9:10; Ps-Philo 9:15; 18:13; 43:5; AddEsth 4:17w, x. c.

Job and His Three Daughters (46-50)* The daughters' inheritance: their father's phylactery 1 46 And they brought forth the estate for distribution among the seven malesb only. 2 For he did not present any of the goods to the females. They were grieved and said to their father, \"Our father, sir, are we not also your children? Why then did you not give us some of your goods?\" 3 But Job said to the females, \"Do not be troubled, my daughters: I have not 4 forgotten you. »I have already designated for you an inheritance better than that 45:4; 47:i of your seven brothers.\"c       Job42:15       5 Then when he had called his daughter who was named Hemera he said to her, \"Take the signet ring, go to the vault, and bring the three golden boxes, so that 6 I may give you your inheritance.\" *So she left and brought them back. 7 And he opened them and brought out three multicolored cordsd whose appearance 8 was such that no man could describe, •since they were not from earth but from 9 heaven,e shimmering with fiery sparks like the rays of the sun.f »And he gave each one a cord, saying, \"Place these about your breast, so it may go well with you all the days of your life.\" 1 47 Then the other daughter, named Kasia,a said to him, \"Father, is this the inheritance which you said was better than that of our brothers? Who has any use 46:4 for these unusualb cords?c We cannot gain a living from them, can we?\" 2 And their father said to them, \"Not only shall you gain a living from these, 3,4 but these cords will lead you into the better world, to live in the heavens.d ^Are 36:3 you then ignorant, my children, of the value of these strings? The Lord considered 46 a. Merely named (1:3 P) prior to this point in TJob, the three daughters dominate the final main section. Chs. 1-45 have been related in the first person; with 46:1, however, there is a sudden shift to third-person discourse, which is sustained through 50:3; thereafter the first person returns, but it is Job's brother Nereus who speaks throughout (51-53). Although such a shift may suggest com­positional evolution, similar shifts of person occur in texts where unity is not in question, such as 2Ezra 6:28; Tob 3:7; and lQapGen 21.23-30. While TJob 1-45 serves to commend the virtues of patience and philanthropy in a manner reminis­cent of the T12P, TJob 46-53 seems rather to legitimate charismatic communion with the angels in a mode approaching Merkabah mysticism. b. A similar interest in males occurs at 15:4. It may be possible to detect here rudimentary proto-gnostic interests, such as the process of \"becoming male\" as an expression for saving enlightenment. c. The whole of TJob may be considered as a Midrashic development from Job 42:15b: \"And their father gave them inheritance rights like their brothers.\" The daughters each receive as their portion one cord of the tri-stranded belt, or girdle, by which Job was miraculously cured (47:5). No particular theological use is made here of \"inher­itance.\" d. S has \"the multicolored objects.\" V has \"three cordlike aprons.\" The meaning is unclear. Elsewhere it is called a cord (sparte, 48:1), cincture (perizdsis, 52:1), phylactery (47:11), while more likely words for \"girdle\" (zone, kestos) are not used. These terms suggest a sash, or cord, derived from the tri-stranded therapeutic girdle that God provided Job (47:5) when the chaUenge was given, \"Gird up your loins ...\" (Job 38:3; 40:7; cf. 42:4 RSV). By this object, Job was cured (47:4-8). Now each of the three daughters is given as her inheritance one of the three cordlike strands, which she is to don as a sash. These \"cords\" are possibly a magical device for fending off evil; see n. i to 47:11. e. In accord with the earth/heaven bifurcation of TJob 33:2-9; 36:3. f. 3En 29:2 describes a class of angels thus: \"And from each of them sparks and lightnings shoot forth; from each of them rays of splendor stream out, and from each of them lights flash; pavilions and tents of brilliance surround them, for even the seraphim and the creatures who are greater than all the celestials cannot look on them.\" 47 a. Kasia and Hemera (46:5) have a part in the conversation with their father. But Amaltheia's Horn is not introduced till 50:1. b. Or, \"useless.\" c. S Slav put the question: \"What then is so unusual about these cords?\" d. As Job affirmed in his psalm (33:2-9) and asserted during his interrogation (36:3), the daugh­ters too will now be enabled to share in the heavenly world, specifically by ecstatic utilization of the language of heavenly beings (48:3; 49:2; 50:2). e. The account of Job's miraculous cure (vss. 4-9) occurs neither in the canonical book nor after TJob 42:3 or 43:17, where it might logically appear. From God's challenge to Job to arise and gird himself for divine questioning (Job 38:3; 40:7; cf. 42:4), TJob in Midrashic style fashions the very \"girdle\" that now becomes the inheritance for the daughters."},{"pageNumber":918,"pageContent":"me worthy of these in the day in which he wished to show me mercy and to rid my body of the plagues and the worms.    20:8    5 \"Calling me, he furnished me with these three cords and said, 'Arise, gird your Job 38:3; 40:2 loins like a man.

See n. d to 1. g. Probably this refers to the event described in TJob 42:1-3 and Job 38:1 LXX. The scene is taken as the origin of an apocalyptic vision disclosing \"things present and impending,\" a typical apoca­lyptic agenda (cf. Rev 1:1; see n. j to 1). Such apocalyptic visions—more precisely the claims based on them made by his opponents—led Paul to his statement in Rom 8:38: \"no angel, no prince, nothing that exists, nothing still to come.\" Yet he allowed even at Corinth a \"revelation\" (apokalyp-sis) among the components of an ordered Christian service (ICor 14:26). h. Cf. 7:11 andn. a to 3. i. Lit. \"phylactery\" (phylakterion). In view of its therapeutic and evil-averting effects, this phy­lactery appears to stem from the sphere of magic. No hint is given that this phylactery corresponds to the usual arm and head cases for miniature Scripture portions, examples of which (with slight differences) have been found at Qumran. In com­mon with the traditional Jewish phylacteries, those of Job's daughters were to be tied on, or at least donned (47:11; 48:1; 49:1; 50:1; 52:1). But it is striking that they wore them at all, since talmudic tradition exempted from the use of phylacteries slaves, mourners, and females (Kid 34a; MK 15a; Tefillin 3). Yet neither is it a pure magical amulet (a written prescription for magically fending off evil). It is thus a case of restrained Jewish magic, resulting in a wearable' 'charm'' Midrashic in origin and capable of effects including those (1) thera­peutic (47:5-7; 52:1); (2) economic (47:2); (3) evil-averting (47:10); (4) glossolalic (48:3; 49:2; 50:2); and (5) apocalyptic-visionary (47:2, 9, 11; 52:9). j. Job, or God? The text is ambiguous. S V Slav read \"the Lord,\" understanding the term as a divine title, as they also did at 40:2, where according to P, Job \"sang praises to the Father.\" \"Father\" is a frequent title for Job in the immediate context: 47:1, 2; 48:1 (cf. 52:9, 12). The \"father\" here seems to be Job, whose own phylactery he is about to grant his daughters as their inheritance, k. V has \"wonders.\" 48 a. The accounts of the daughters putting on their sashes (48-50) show several common ele­ments: (1) the name of the daughter; (2) donning the sash; (3) having the \"heart changed\"; (4) no longer concerned with worldly things; (5) glosso-lalia in the language of specified heavenly beings; (6) a brief characterization of the contents of glos-solalia; and (7) reported preservation of the speeches in mythical books (but see n. h to 48). b. Lit. \"Day.\" See nn. f, g, and h to 1. c. S has \"wrapped it around herself.\" d. V heightens by adding \"and at once she was outside her own flesh,\" which parallels Paul's * ecstatic ascent; he twice wondered whether the ascent was \"in the body\" or \"outside the body\" (2Cor 12:2f.). The changed \"heart\" (cf. 49:1; 50:2) refers not to conversion but appears rather to describe the onset of the ecstatic state, \"the descent to the Merkabah.\" When Saul was \"also among the prophets,\" it is said that \"God gave him another heart.\" Note the similarity to the language of Montanus preserved in the 4th-cent. heresiologist Epiphanius: \"Behold! Humankind is like a harp, and I strum as a plectrum; humans sleep, I am awake. Behold! The Lord is the one who excites the hearts of humans, the one who gives them a heart\" (AdvHaer 48.4.1)."},{"pageNumber":919,"pageContent":"3 earthly thingsc—•but she spoke ecstatically in the angelic dialect,* sending up a hymn to God in accord with the hymnic style of the angels.

With this avoidance of \"worldly things\" can be related Job's own deprecation of \"earthly things\" (TJob 36:3; see n. a to 36) and especially his psalm of affirmation (TJob 33), where the heavenly throne is described as Job's present possession, an onto-logical rather than eschatological dualism. The on­tology resembles Heb, especially 9:1 and 8:5: While eschatological events are not absent (Heb 9:28; TJob 4:9; 47:9) they play no major role. To the contrary, the enduring reality of the upper world is already realized (Heb 12:22-24, in community; TJob 48-50, by ecstatic access). Overall, TJob shows an eschatology closer to Heb. than to Qumran (or, for that matter, to the Montanists with their hope for the descending New Jerusalem; Epi­phanius, AdvHaer 49.1.2f.). f. Similarly, \"the dialect of the archons\" (49:2), \"the dialect of those on high\" (50:1), \"the dialect of the cherubim (50:2), \"the distinctive dialect\" (52:7). The source of Paul's \"tongues ... of angels\" (ICor 13:1)? Paul, however, does not use \"dialect\" (dialektos), which in NT is Luke's word alone. In the account of the Pentecostal glossolalia, Luke uses the word expressly for humans (of varied nationality) and not for angels; contrast his use of \"magnify\" (megalunein; see n. a to 38). In ApAb 17, an angel teaches Abraham a heavenly song, recital of which leads him to a vision of the Merkabah. The singing of hymns by females (\"vir­gins\") in the language of the cherubim—as well as the notion of the \"Chariot of the Father\"—is known also to Resurrection of Bartholomew (ed. Budge, Coptic Apocrypha, pp. 1 If., 189). g. See n. a to 43. \"Spirit\" here could be the subject: \"As she spoke ecstatically, the Spirit let it be inscribed on her garment.\" In view of parallel titles of poems at 49:3 and 50:3, Kraft—followed here—takes \"The Spirit\" as also a title of a poem or hymn. V omits the entire sentence. h. For \"on her garment (en stole),11 M. J. Schwartz (in Philonenko, Sem 18 [1968] 56) in­geniously conjectures \"in her epistle\" (en epi stole). The proposal has in its favor the provision of a book corresponding to the \"Hymns of Kasia\" (49:3) and the \"Prayers of Amaltheia's Horn\" (50:3). But the conjecture may be unnecessary. Philo (Vita com 29) speaks of hymnic composition by the Therapeutae using the same term (charatto). The existence of mystically engraved gems per­taining to 3rd-cent. Gnosticism is well known (cf. C. Bonner, Studies in Magical Amulets [Ann Arbor, 1950] pp. 1-21). So are the \"garments of glory\" prepared for such persons as Isaiah (Ascenls 9:2-11); Metatron (3En 12:1); and Enoch (2En 22:8). Most interesting is the line in Hekhalot Rabbati 24, where God is described as \"glorified with embroideries of songs\" (hmhwdr brkmy syr; cf. G. Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism [New York, 19652] p. 26; cf. p. 128 and n. to p. 26). Scholem (p. 24) also calls attention to AZ 24b, where animals addressing the ark sing a hymn containing the line describing the throne as \"girdled in golden em­broidery.\" Finally, Hekhalot Rabbati 3.4 says of God's garment, \"And it is every part engraved from within and from without JHWH JHWH.\" These and other comparatively inaccessible texts grouped by Scholem disclose a motif of the \"gar­ment of God,\" sometimes said to be inscribed. While these sources are late (3rd. cent, A.D.), it may be possible to see in Hemera's inscribed skirt a development of early Merkabah traditions already present in 4Q§irSabb 37-40. 49 a. Probably this is another title of a poem. Possibly \"the creation of the heavens\" was one of the various subjects of mystical inquiry featured in Merkabah mysticism. b. Cf.

What singing angels sound like, which pre­sumably those using their language would resemble, can be gauged from 2En 17:1 J: \"In the middle of the heaven, I saw armed troops, worshiping the LORD with tympani and pipes, and unceasing voices, and pleasant [voices and pleasant and unceasing] and various songs which it is impossible to describe.

The shift back to first person (as TJob 1:4-45:4)—but now to Nereus—affects at least 51:1-4 and 53:1-4. See nn. i to 1 and a to 46. The name \"Nereus\" is a Gk. mythological deity. Nereus, sometimes said to be the oldest of the gods, was an apt choice for the name of an oracular recorder, since this god himself was said to have had the gift of prophecy (Horace, Carmina 1.15). Like Job, the god Nereus had daughters, the fifty (number varies) Nereids, whose names were re­corded. Like Satan, Nereus could transform himself into many shapes (fire, water, etc., Apollodorus 2.5.11). Paul knew a Christian of this name at Rome (Rom 16:15). Nereus is called Nahor (Naor) at TJob 1:6 S V Slav, where he is made a brother to Esau by S and a brother to Job by V. c. Perhaps the same angel as the one who met Job earlier, TJob 5:2 (cf. 18:5). P speaks here of \"the Holy Spirit,\" while V omits the whole phrase. d. See n. a to 38. V adds so as to read \"the magnificent things of the three daughters of my brother.\" e. The translation is uncertain; possibly, \"made signs to each other,\" or \"noted things down for each other\" (so Kraft). f. 2En knows of books written by angels (22:11) and—at the angel's dictation—by Enoch (23:6; cf. Rev 2:1 and Rom 16:22). 4Ezra 14:42, on the other hand, has five men writing in unfamiliar letters what Ezra himself uttered under inspiration. In TJob, however, it is Nereus himself who takes the literary initiative, even though both the Lord and the \"holy angel\" (or, \"Holy Spirit\"?) were present. 52 a. See n. d to 1. b. Regularly called angels by V (52:5, 6, 8; 47:11). c. According to 14:If., Job had a ten-stringed lyre with which he entertained the widows after dinner. d. A censer as Job had in earlier days of glory (32:8). e. The ascent of Job's soul is not unlike that said of Enoch, where, however, there is no death involved and no soul/body separation: 3En 6:1, \"When the Holy One, blessed be he, desired to lift me up on high, he first sent4 Anaphiel H [H = tetragrammaton], the Prince, and he took me from their midst in their sight and carried me in great glory upon a fiery chariot with fiery horses, servants of glory.

SANDERS The works that now bear the titles \"The Testament of Abraham,\" \"The Testament of Isaac,\" and 'The Testament of Jacob\" apparently spring from an apocryphal book, written in Greek during the first century by a Jewish author in Egypt, which dealt with the death of Abraham, his tour of the inhabited world, and his view of the judgment. It is no longer possible to ascertain the history of the story in Jewish usage, but it would appear that the story about Abraham developed into two distinct recensions before it was appropriated by Christians. The Testament of Isaac and the Testament of Jacob are derivative from the Testament of Abraham, perhaps being written to round out the stories of the deaths of the three patriarchs, and they were apparently written in that order: The Testament of Isaac refers to Michael's being sent to Abraham (2:1), as well as to the story of Abraham's death (8:1), while the Testament of Jacob refers to the commemoration of the deaths of both the other two patriarchs (1:2; 8:1). In addition, as the marginal references will make clear, the Testament of Jacob echoes many of the themes of the Testament of Isaac. As they now stand, the latter two testaments contain more Christian elements than the Testament of Abraham in either recension; but it cannot be said with certainty whether they were originally composed by Jews or Christians. It is certain, however, that eventually all three were Christianized and became the exclusive property of the Church. They were for some centuries immensely popular in Christianity, as may be seen both from their wide distribution and from the influence of the Testament of Abraham on later Christian writing and art.

When it is time for Abraham to die, God sends the archangel Michael to inform him to prepare for death and to make a will. It is hoped that Abraham will voluntarily surrender his soul to Michael. Abraham, however, is recalcitrant and refuses to go, requesting first to be shown all the inhabited world. After consulting with God, Michael conducts Abraham on such a tour. Abraham, seeing people engaged in various sins, calls down death upon them, but God tells Michael to stop the tour; for he, unlike Abraham, is compassionate and postpones the death of sinners so that they may repent. Abraham is then conducted to the place of judgment to witness the fate of souls after they depart from their bodies, so that he may repent of his severity. He learns that souls are tried in three ways: by fire, by record, and by balance; and he learns that there are three judgments: by Abel, by the twelve tribes of Israel, and, finally, by God. Abraham intercedes on behalf of a soul that is judged to be neither wicked nor righteous and, repenting for his former harshness, he then pleads on behalf of those whom he had caused to die. God saves the former and restores the latter. Abraham is taken back home, but he still declines to surrender his soul. God finally sends Death, who shows Abraham his ferocity and who at last takes his soul by a deception. The soul of Abraham is conducted to heaven by angels. Texts The Testament of Abraham exists in two basic forms, a longer form, attested by several Greek manuscripts and supported on the whole by a Rumanian version (TAb A), and a shorter form, attested by several Greek manuscripts and supported on the whole by the Slavonic version, a Rumanian version, and by the Coptic, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions (TAb B).1 The best witnesses for each of the two forms are the Greek manuscripts, although the versions are useful in shedding light on various points.2 There are several minor and two major differences between the two Greek recensions, but it is likely that they have a common ancestor. The only published critical text of the two recensions of the Testament of Abraham is that of M. R. James,3 and the present translation is based on his text, taking into account some of the major variants. In his recent thesis, F. Schmidt has argued strongly that, for the shorter recension, manuscript E, which was not known to James, provides the best Greek text. The notes to B give special attention to the readings of E, a typed copy of which was kindly provided by Schmidt. 1 The most complete discussion of the texts and versions is that by F. Schmidt, Le Testament a\"Abraham: Introduction, edition de la recension courte, traduction et notes, vol. 1, pp. 1-20. See also A.-M. Denis, Introduction, pp. 32-34; M. Delcor, Le Testament d'Abraham, pp. 5-24. Delcor misstates the relationship of the northern versions, Slavonic and Rumanian, to the Gk. recs. on p. 23, although he describes it accurately on p. 16. 2 Schmidt (Le Testament d'Abraham) has shown that one of the Slavonic versions is an important supporter of what may be the best MS of TAb B, Gk.

Fonds Grec 1613, fols. 87v~96v, dated in the fifteenth century. Now to be especially noted is MS E: Milan, Abrosienne Grec 405, fols. 164r-171r, dated in the eleventh or twelfth century. Scholarly opinion is divided on the relative antiquity of the two forms of the Testament of Abraham.4 With regard to the story, the Testament of Abraham B differs from the Testament of Abraham A in two major ways: First, in B Abraham's view of the judgment is before his tour of the world, not after; second, in B the judgment scene itself is much less fully described. Instead of the elaboration of A (three means of judgment; three judgments), there is only the story of the condemnation of a woman who was a heinous sinner. The style and vocabulary of B are simpler and less verbose than that of A. There are also fewer late words and fewer places where Christian influence is probable.5 The first editor of the Greek recensions, M. R. James, was of the opinion that A best represents the contents and order of the original composition, while B sometimes preserves earlier wording.6 In spite of the difficulties inherent in any complicated solution, this still seems to be the soundest conclusion. But even though it is best to conclude that the contents and order of the original are better preserved in A, James's other point must also be emphasized: B lacks most of the late words of A in its present form, some of which are not evidenced before the fifth century A.D., and B lacks most of A's evidence of Christian influence.7 The story itself is not substantially Christianized; the Messiah, or the Son of Man, or Christ, for example, does not appear in the judgment scene. The present form of A, however, does show some instances of Christian editing, such as a few verbal dependencies on the New Testament, and these are almost entirely absent from B. (See \"Relation to canonical books.\") Although there are numerous differences among the various Greek manuscripts that support each recension, the difference between the two recensions is even more strongly marked, and it is necessary to postulate a separate Vorlage for each of them. These two Vorlage themselves probably have a common ancestor, but neither appears to be directly dependent on the other. The existence of an ultimate common ancestor is indicated not only by the general similarity of the story line but also by the high degree of verbatim agreement between the two recensions in some chapters and occasional striking verbatim agreements even in the sections where the order of events differs.8 On the other hand, the existence of two separate intermediate ancestors is indicated by the consistency in style, syntax, and vocabulary within each recension.9 It appears that there was originally a book about Abraham that contained approximately the contents of the Greek Testament of Abraham A in the order given there. It was rewritten in at least two principal recensions, each one of which was translated into different languages and copied in Greek without close concern for exactitude. The later copyists were presumably Christians, with the result that some Christian phraseology crept into A and a Christian doxology was added to both recensions (so all MSS except E of rec. B). Different manuscripts and versions were Christianized to different degrees, but no thoroughly systematic Chris-4 It is debatable whether or not TAb A and TAb B are directly or indirectly related and even whether there is an original behind either or both of them. See R. A. Kraft, SCS 6, pp. 121-37. The present proposal is for an indirect and complicated relationship between the two recs. and for a common ancestor at some remove from the extant witnesses. 5 The most thorough examination of the vocabulary of TAb and of parallels with the NT is that of N. Turner, The Testament of Abraham: A Study of the Original Language, Place of Origin, Authorship, and Relevance.

Box, The Testament of Abraham, p. xiii; Delcor, Le Testament d'Abraham, p. 33; G. W. E. Nickelsburg, SCS 6, p. 92. Nickelsburg convincingly argues the case in favor of the priority of the story as it appears in A. See also n. b to BIO below. 7 These points have been emphasized in the theses of Turner and Schmidt; cf. Nickelsburg, SCS 6, p. 92. 8 The amount and the significance of verbatim agreement between the two recs. have been underestimated.

The precise wording of the original cannot be ascertained, although frequently it may be better represented by B.10 Original language Among early scholars, L. Ginzberg and K. Kohler favored a Hebrew original of the Testament of Abraham, while G. H. Box maintained that the work was originally Palestinian and may have had a Semitic original, even though the present Greek does not read like a translation. N. Turner agreed with Box's view with regard to recension A, but argued that B was a translation from Hebrew, written not in Palestine but in Egypt. Schmidt has accepted the hypothesis of a Hebrew original for B.11 Of the scholars mentioned, only Turner systematically and in detail tried to establish a Hebrew original for one of the recensions.12 It is noteworthy that he first modified his position to the view that a Hebrew original is only slightly more likely than the alternative (that B was written in 4'Jewish Greek\");13 and he has now kindly indicated to the present writer that he 4'cannot believe either recension to be a translation.\"14 M. Delcor is the principal exponent of the view that the original was written in Greek.15 He cites the closeness of much of the language to the later, or Alexandrian, books of the Septuagint and regards the Semitisms as being \"Septuagintalisms.\" Delcor, however, based his study primarily on A. Turner had already noted that A shows knowledge of the Septuagint of Genesis, although he considered that B does not; and also that A, but not B, has \"a strong linguistic similarity with 2, 3, 4 Maccabees.\"16 Thus there is no dispute about the language of A: It is not based directly on a Hebrew original and it does reflect Alexandrian Greek. There is still, however, the question of B: Is the language, besides being simpler, also indicative of a Hebrew original? The only weakness in Turner's original analysis points the way to the solution of the problem. He meticulously dated the Greek of both recensions (See \"Date\"), but not the Hebrew of his retroversion.17 B can, for the most part, be smoothly translated into Hebrew, but it is the classical Hebrew of the early narrative sections of the Bible that emerges, not any form of late Hebrew as known from the late canonical books, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and rabbinic literature. Thus what we have in B, and occasionally also in A, is an imitation of the classical biblical prose style, which the author doubtless thought was appropriate to his theme. The question of whether this sort of Jewish Greek existed as a spoken language among Jews of 10 Although A contains more late words than B, and clearer evidence of Christian influence, it also has more terminological affinity with other Jewish literature of Egyptian provenance, as the nn. to the translation will show. The language of A cannot always be considered later than that of B, and room for conjecture as to the original wording will remain. The verbatim agreements between the two recs. should afford the best evidence for the original vocabulary and style. 11 Schmidt, Le Testament a\"Abraham, vol. 1, p. 120. 12 No one has proposed an Aram, original, and Turner's study shows that the Semitisms are Hebraisms rather than Aramaisms. See his The Testament of Abraham, p. 57. 13 Turner, \"The Testament of Abraham': Problems in Biblical Greek,\" NTS 1 (1954/55) 222f. 14 Letter of November 24, 1976. The reason for the change in Turner's view since he wrote his thesis in 1951 is that, in his comprehensive studies of the syntax and grammar of biblical Gk. (see n. 18 below), he repeatedly found the same Semitizing style that marks the Testament of Abraham, especially rec. B. In a further note to the present writer, dated November 10, 1977, he wrote in part, \"I now think that books written freely in 'biblical Greek' were relatively representative phenomena among Jews and Christians who had tasted the influence of the synagogue and knew the Greek versions of the Bible very well . . . Like Professor Sanders I would think that both recensions were more likely to have been composed in this dialect of Greek than to have been literally rendered from a Vorlage; that the Semitic idioms had already infused the dialect known to the author, who was not consciously translating nor even thinking in one language and writing in another.\" 15 Delcor, Le Testament a\"Abraham, p. 34: written in Gk. in Alexandria. Cf. E. Janssen, \"Testament Abrahams\" (JSHRZ 3 [1975]) 193-256; see pp. 198-200: written in Gk. in Palestine. 16 Turner, NTS 1 (1954/55) 221, summarizes the detailed demonstration in his thesis. In favor of the use of LXX in B, however, see the agreements noted in B2, nn. b, c; B5, n. a. 17 A similar problem exists in the study by R. A. Martin, \"Syntax Criticism of the Testament of Abraham,\" SCS 6, pp. 95-120.

It would be possible to imitate the classical style in Hebrew, but there are no clear instances of such an imitation, even when biblical themes are being dealt with in late apocalypses. It was earlier noted that there is extensive verbatim agreement between the two recensions, which in general seem to have had separate histories of transmission, and this fact argues strongly in favor of Greek as the language of the original composition.20 When we add to this evidence the observation that the habit of composing in Semitizing Greek was widespread, the best conclusion is seen to be that both recensions had Greek originals. Date Estimates of the date of the Testament of Abraham have ranged very widely and for good reason. There are no references to historical events, the doctrines of the book are not datable to any narrow historical period, and even the language of the work does not present a sure criterion, since, on the one hand, it is doubtful that we have the original language; and, on the other, B is written in a style partly imitative of classical biblical prose. James, who regarded the work as Christian, thought that it must have been later than the Apocalypse of Peter21 and earlier than Origen: \"That it was written in the second century, that it embodies legends earlier than that century, and that it received its present form perhaps in the ninth or tenth century, seems ... a sufficiently probable estimate.,,22 Turner's original estimate of the date of the book was much earlier. He regarded it as having been written in Egypt before the Septuagint was translated or in wide use, and when at least some Jews still spoke Hebrew. He dated the Greek translation represented by B to c. 200-165 B.C. and that represented by A to a period not much later, though perhaps as late as the second century A.D., with some late additions.23 Schmidt, who regards the work as Palestinian, composed in Hebrew in either Essene or related circles, dates the original to the first half of the first century A.D.24 He argues that, since the Testament of Abraham is concerned with only individual eschatology, it must come after 4 Ezra, where both individual and collective or national eschatology are matters of concern. Apart from the fact that it is impossible to suppose that there was a steady progression from national eschatology to a mixture of national and individual eschatology to purely individual eschatology,25 the argument that the Testament of Abraham comes after 4 Ezra is itself in conflict with the pre-50 date, since 4 Ezra must be dated after the destruction of the Temple in A.D. 70. On the assumption that the original work was written in Greek and comes from Egypt (See \"Provenance\"), it is possible to make a reasonable conjecture of the date on the basis of general considerations. It is doubtful if Egyptian, especially Alexandrian, Judaism was sufficiently intact after A.D. 117 to allow the production of such literature,26 especially a work like the Testament of Abraham, which does not distinguish Jew from gentile in the judgment. On the other hand, it is unlikely that the work is very early. It combines genres and motifs that must have been known to the author from other literature: some aspects of 18 Most recently, see N. Turner, A Grammar of New Testament Greek IV: Style (Edinburgh, 1976) p. 7, and further references there. 19 For examples from Lk, ProUames, Acts of Pilate, see E. P. Sanders, The Tendencies of the Synoptic Tradition (Cambridge, 1969) pp. 200-02, 226, 228. 20 Turner's original view, The Testament of Abraham, pp. 242-48, that A and B are independent translations, does not account for the verbatim agreement between them. Considering the gross differences between A and B, the degree of verbatim agreement is remarkable and points toward a Gk. original. 21 James's hypothesis about ApPet as a source for many traditions in TAb and elsewhere (Testament, p. 23) was not borne out when fragments of the lost work were subsequenUy found. 22 James, Testament, p. 29. 23 Turner, The Testament of Abraham, pp. 242, 248. 24 Schmidt, Le Testament d'Abraham, p. 120. 25 Note, for example, the late (3rd cent, or later) story of R. Joshua b. Levi (BHM, vol. 2, pp. 48-51) and the still later apocalypse of Elia (BHM, vol. 2, pp. 65-68), where the expectation of Israel's victory over the gentiles in the messianic time appears. 26 For the date, see V. Tcherikover, Hellenistic Civilization and the Jews (Philadelphia, 1959) p. 356 and n. 65, where further references are given."},{"pageNumber":928,"pageContent":"the testament genre, the \"ascension\" or heavenly tour genre, and the motif of resistance to death apparently borrowed from the Moses traditions. (See below.) Further, there is a concern, assuming that A preserves the original contents, to bring into one picture the different images of the judgment: fire, balance, and written records. It seems best to assume a date for the original of c. A.D. 100, plus or minus twenty-five years. The work was rewritten by more than one hand, and A in particular shows the traces of late redactional activity. The redactional activity that imparted to A, and to a lesser extent to B, late words and traces of New Testament passages, however, must be distinguished from the rewriting that produced the ancestors of the two recensions. If the late redactional activity had extended to rewriting, it would doubtless also have resulted in a pronounced Christianizing of the text, especially the judgment scene.27 Despite being repeatedly copied by Christian scribes, the Testament of Abraham in both recensions remains unmistakably Jewish. Provenance If the Testament of Abraham is regarded as having been originally written in Greek, the most likely place of origin is Egypt.28 The evidence for this may be summarized as follows: The vocabulary, especially of A, shows strong similarity to that of the late books of the Septuagint and to other Jewish books written in Greek in Egypt (e.g. 3Mac); the motif of the weighing of souls is most closely paralleled in late Egyptian depictions; the three levels of judgment may reflect the three levels of government in Egypt. These arguments are decisive only for recension A. Since it appears that the story as it is found in A, especially the account of the judgment scene, more accurately reflects the ultimate common ancestor (see above, n. 6, and references there), it is best to postulate Egyptian provenance for the original story. Recension B is as lacking in definite signs of its place of origin as it is in definite indications of its date. It would be reasonable to assume that the story was redacted where it first circulated, in Egypt, but there is nothing that would decisively rule out other Jewish centers in the Mediterranean basin. In the discussion of provenance it is instructive to consider the connections between the Testament of Abraham and other Jewish literature. The closest parallels, both in terms of some of the major motifs and in terms of details, are to be found in the Testament of Job, 3 Baruch, 2 Enoch, and the Apocalypse of Moses. Some scholars have argued that each of these works originates from Egypt. The Egyptian origin of most of them (TJob is the exception) is now questioned.29 If such works as 3 Baruch and the Apocalypse of Moses do not come from Egypt, their close resemblance to some aspects of the Testament of Abraham would seem to indicate the degree to which themes, motifs, and ideas \"floated\" around the Mediterranean world. In any case, as will be shown in more detail in the notes to the translation, there are more parallels between the Testament of Abraham and the works just named than between it and any other grouping of more or less contemporary literature.30 There have been repeated attempts to find a connection between the Testament of Abraham and one of the Jewish parties named by Josephus, particularly the Essenes. Ginzberg hesitated 27 Thus even if the judgment scene in A is not original, it is still Jewish and comes from A.D. 100. 28 Turner, even when arguing for a Heb. original, proposed Egypt as the country of origin, while Schmidt, who favors a Palestinian provenance for the original, considers A to be the result of an Egyptian redaction. See Turner, The Testament of Abraham, pp. 177-85; Schmidt, Le Testament d Abraham, pp. 119-21. Janssen (JSHRZ 3, pp. 198f.) proposed Gk. composition and a Palestinian origin, but the latter rests on very weak grounds, e.g. that the interest in Mamie shows \"Palestinian coloring\" (p. 199). The phrase \"oak of Mamre\" is derived from the LXX; see Al n. a. For arguments in favor of Egyptian origin, see also Delcor, Le Testament d'Abraham, pp. 28-32,59-62,67f. 29 In favor of the Egyptian origin of ApMos, see A.-M. Denis, Introduction, p. 6; on 2En (the long rec), see J. H. Charlesworth, PMR, p. 104; on 3Bar, see J. C. Picard, PVTG 2, pp. 77f.; on TJob, see M. Philonenko, \"Le Testament de Job,\" Sem 18 (1968) 24. For the latest views see the introductions to each work in the present edition. 30 There are numerous parallels with regard to details in rabbinic and other Heb. and Aram, literature, but many of them are in late material; and, when the vast size of this material is considered, the proportion of parallels is seen to be relatively small. Kohler (\"The Pre-Talmudic Haggada II: The Apocalypse of Abraham and its Kindred,\" JQR 7 [1895]) exaggerated the degree to which motifs of TAb are paralleled in rabbinic literature. Thus, for example, the passages referred to on p. 593 as showing that \"the Midrash . . . preserved the memory of Abraham's ride above the vault of heaven\" (GenR 48, 82) are not really to the point. Further, in considering the relation of TAb to rabbinic sources, the different and even contradictory motifs in the latter should be noted: E.g. Abraham was the first to dispose of his property in his lifetime (TanBub Noah 20, vol, 1, p. 47), a motif that is directly opposite one of the themes of TAb."},{"pageNumber":929,"pageContent":"on whether to attribute the Testament of Abraham to the Pharisees or Essenes, while Kohler definitely attributed it to the Essenes. Recently Schmidt has called it \"a writing springing from a popular Essenism,\"31 while Delcor also sees a link with Essenism, and concludes that the Testament of Abraham may come from the Therapeutae.32 Kohler's evidence could now be dismissed were it not for the fact that recent scholars cite him as having shown that both the Testament of Abraham and the Testament of Job have Essene traits and continue to consider his outmoded list of Essene characteristics as accurate. Kohler's view of Essenism was eccentric in his own time33 and now should be considered completely discredited; his finding of Essene \"traits\" (hospitality, cosmopolitanism, an emphasis on angels and the like) in the Testament of Abraham should no longer be cited as evidence for an Essene origin of the work. Kohler mentioned that the eschatology of the Testament of Abraham was Essene without specifying why he came to this conclusion.34 Recently Schmidt has argued that it is Essene because of the clear distinction between body and soul, a distinction Josephus attributes to the Essenes.35 The evening prayers (B4:5),36 the mention of a divine chariot, the elaborate angelology, and the mention of the \"River Ocean\" (B8:3)37 have also been cited as showing some connection with Essenism. None of these points is convincing. Josephus also attributes belief in the immortality of the soul to the Pharisees, adding that they believed in the transmigration of souls (War 2.163). Josephus' comments demonstrate two points: First, supposing that his description is accurate, belief in the immortality of the soul was not peculiarly Essene; and, second, his attribution of a doctrine of transmigration to the Pharisees should make one cautious about relying very strictly on his descriptions. Morning and evening prayers are common in Judaism, and one learns more about merkabah (\"chariot\") speculation from rabbinic literature than from the Dead Sea Scrolls. A developed angelology is common in Judaism, and the angels of the Testament of Abraham have no particularly Essene traits.38 Finally, in the Testament of Abraham, at least in B, Abraham lives in a city (B3:2), which would seem to rule out a connection with Philo's Therapeutae, who were strictly non-urban dwellers.39 The most important observation is that the Testament of Abraham, far from presenting the particular doctrines of some Jewish sect, represents a kind of lowest-common-denominator Judaism. In some ways its most characteristic feature is its characterlessness; it lacks peculiar traits. Historical importance The Testament of Abraham, along with 2 Enoch and 3 Baruch, bears witness to the existence of a universalistic and generalized Judaism, in which \"good works\" consisted of such obvious virtues as charity and hospitality, coupled with avoidance of obvious moral sins—murder, adultery, and robbery—and according to which all people, whether Jew or gentile, are judged according to how well they observe these ethical requirements. The Torah 31 Schmidt, Le Testament d'Abraham, vol. 1, p. 120. 32 Delcor, Le Testament d'Abraham, pp. 69-72. 33 Kohler, for example, equated the hasidim (\"pious\") of rabbinic literature with the Essenes and thus greatfy extended the range of \"Essene traits.\" See Kohler, JQR 7 (1895); countered by A. Biichler, Types of Jewish-Palestinian Piety from 70 B.C.E. to 70 C.E.: The Ancient Pious Men (London, 1922). Kohler further thought that \"Essenism\" was represented by such leading rabbis of the post-Essene period as R. Eliezer the Great and R. Ishmael (JQR 7 [1895]), and he attributed to the Essenes the trait of universalism, just the opposite of the sectarianism that we now know was the characteristic of the sect. Kohler is still cited, however, as having shown the Essene traits of TAb and TJob by such modern scholars as Delcor, Schmidt, and Philonenko. 34 Kohler, JQR 7 (1895). 35 Schmidt, Le Testament d'Abraham, vol. 1, pp. 54f., referring to War 2.7. 154-58 and other passages such as 4Ezra 7:78. He must also then consider 4Ezra as related to Essenism (p. 55a). 36 Schmidt, Le Testament d'Abraham, pp. 82f. 37 Delcor, Le Testament d'Abraham, pp. 70f. Josephus, when describing the Essenes (War 2.155), writes, \"Sharing the belief of the sons of Greece, they maintain that for virtuous souls there is reserved an abode beyond the ocean\" (trans. H. Thackeray, LCL). Josephus clearly has in mind the Gk. \"Isles of the Blessed,\" and it is precarious to see here vocabulary used by Essenes themselves. Delcor also refers to 3Bar 2:1: \"A river which no one can cross,\" which shows how widely spread the supposed Essene influence must be on his hypothesis. 38 On angelology, see recently A. Kolenkow, SCS 6, pp. 153-62. 39 See Philo, Vita cont 18-20."},{"pageNumber":930,"pageContent":"and the covenant of Israel seem to play no role. The Testament of Abraham is one of the few witnesses, and thus a very important one, to the existence in Egypt of a form of Judaism that stressed neither the philosophical interpretation of Judaism, as did Philo, nor the need to retain strictly the commandments that set Jews apart from gentiles, as did the author of Joseph and Asenath. Judaism is depicted here as a religion of commonplace moral values, which nevertheless insists both on the strictness of God's judgment and on his mercy and compassion. Theological importance The most striking feature of the Testament of Abraham is the one that has just been noted: the lowest-common-denominator universalism of its soteriology. This feature was especially noted by Kohler, who spoke of the work's ' 'cosmopolitan humanity.',40 Other commentators have noted the universalism of the work but have not seen it as a particularly striking feature.41 The principal component parts of the lowest-common-denominator universalistic soteriology are these: First, there is no distinction between Jew and gentile. The only reference to Israel is the one in A13:6, which mentions the judgment by the twelve tribes; this implies a special role for Israel, but Israel's importance is not developed and does not inform the rest of the book. Abraham looks down on the sins of \"the inhabited world,\" (A10:l; cf. B12:12, \"all the creation\"); it is the souls of all mankind which will be judged, the descendants of Adam, not of Abraham or Jacob (All:9; B8:12f.). The vast majority of Jewish documents provide a special place for Israel in the divine economy, either restricting salvation to Israel,42 providing for the future restoration of the twelve tribes,43 or allowing that some righteous gentiles will be saved along with faithful Israelites;44 but in any case making a clear distinction.45 The works that most closely parallel the universalism of the Testament of Abraham are 2 Enoch and 3 Baruch.46 Second, the sins mentioned in the Testament of Abraham are heinous by anyone's definition; and no specifically Jewish transgressions, such as hiding circumcision, transgressing the Sabbath or the dietary laws, and the like, are mentioned—not even idolatry, which is condemned in 2 Enoch 10:6 and 3 Baruch 13:4. Third, everyone is judged by the same standard, whether the majority of his deeds be good or evil, and even Abraham's intercessory prayer is not specified as being for his descendants.47 One hears nothing about the merits of the patriarchs aiding their descendants, God's forgiving observant Jews on the Day of Atonement, or anything of the sort. Fourth, the only means of atonement mentioned are repentance and premature death. Repentance plays a principal part in any Jewish work dealing with sin and atonement, and there are good rabbinic parallels for the idea that death, especially premature death, atones. Those whom God punishes by death will not be further punished.48 But again this is not applied in the Testament of Abraham to those in the covenant, who need only to repent or be sufficiently punished in order to retain their share of the covenant promises; the atoning efficacy of repentance and premature death applies equally to all. This universalism stands in sharp contrast to the strong emphasis on converting to Judaism in the Egyptian work 40 Kohler, JQR 7 (1895). 41 Cf. Turner, The Testament of Abraham, pp. 149f. Turner saw the universalism as supporting an early date, since he thought that it soon disappeared from Judaism. 42 E.g. AsMos 10:7f.; R. Eliezer in tSanh 13:2; JosAsen 8:5; 9:2; 15:3, 7f.; perhaps Philo: See Sanders, \"The Covenant as a Soteriological Category and the Nature of Salvation in Palestinian and Hellenistic Judaism,\" Jews, Greeks and Christians, R. Hamerton-Kelly and R. Scroggs, eds. (Leiden, 1976) pp. 26-38. 43 E.g. AsMos 4;6f.; Philo, Praem 162-72; 4Ezra 13:39f. 44 E.g. R.

The lists of vices, for example, are quite general, although idolatry is mentioned (13:4). In 2En, note such phrases as \"all the souls of mankind, however many are born\" (23:4; cf. 43:1); race of Adam (30:15); no one shall escape notice in the day of judgment (46:3); whoever accepts and obeys (48:6-9). There are, however, some motifs that are more distinctly Jewish: sacrifices atone (59:2; but cf. 45:1-3); \"upper Jerusalem\" as a name for heaven (55:2). One can find a few other sentences in Jewish materials that put \"all the children of the world\" or \"all nations\" on equal terms at the end. See lEn 10:21; 91:14 (J. T.

The emphasis on judgment on the basis of deeds (A12f.; B9f.) is standard, both in Jewish and Christian literature,52 although the literal depiction of it in the Testament of Abraham is unique. The efficacy of repentance and God's merciful inclination to delay the death of sinners until they repent are noteworthy, and the delay of death to allow for repentance is perhaps a unique motif.53 God is the final judge, although recension A differs from most Jewish and Christian literature in interposing two prior levels of judgment. God can be directly prayed to and is directly concerned with men's conduct, although he uses angels as intermediaries. Michael, as often elsewhere, is the chief intermediary. Two angels not mentioned elsewhere are named: Dokiel, who weighs, and Puriel, who tests by fire. The idea that the soul separates from the body at the time of death, and that it is the soul that goes either to salvation or punishment, is relatively widespread. Recension A does not, as do some documents, explicitly provide for the future resurrection of the body and the reunion of body and soul, although B7:16, where the resurrection is mentioned, does imply such a reunion (see A20 n. h). Since it appears likely that one of the main purposes of the original author was to describe the judgment scene (see \"Genre and relation to other Jewish and Christian literature\"), and thus to indicate on what basis all individuals would gain either life or punishment, this theme deserves further comment. As has been noted, the soteriology of A is simple: If sins not repented of or punished by premature death prior to the judgment outweigh or outnumber righteous deeds, the soul is sentenced to punishment. If righteous deeds predominate, the soul goes to life. If they are equally balanced, the implication of A14:6 seems to be that the balance can be tilted in favor of life by intercessory prayer. God is merciful and desires that sinners repent, but if they deserve punishment, he is righteous and will punish. All this is straightforward, and most of these themes are common in Jewish materials. The author's particular contribution is in having everyone, Jew or gentile, judged on the same basis and in describing the judgment concretely. The author brought together in graphic form three traditional images of judgment, although they are not actually harmonized or assigned separate roles in the testing of deeds. The operative means of testing appears to be the enumeration of deeds written in a book. Further, the author harmonized three levels of judgment: the judgment of individual souls immediately after death, the traditional nationalistic theme of the judgment of gentiles by Israel (or of the wicked by the righteous), and the final apocalyptic judgment by God. In both these cases—the presentation of three modes of judgment and the presentation of three levels of judgment—the author is reconciling separate traditional motifs, but the harmony is only pictorial and is not based on a systematic explanation of how the harmo­nization works. 49 Virt 219 (on proselytes who join the [Jewish] commonwealth, which is \"full of true life and vitality\"). Cf. the importance of being initiated into the mysteries of Moses, Virt 178. 50 TJob 15:9; 42:6-8; cf. 2En 59:2; 62:1. 51 Delcor, Le Testament d'Abraham, p. 36, thinks that the reference to Abraham's hospitality implies his activity in proselytism, citing a rabbinic Midrash to that effect. Cf. Schmidt (Le Testament d'Abraham, vol. 1, p. 120). What is striking about TAb is that proselytism is not mentioned at all; nor is there need to refer to it, since all the race of Adam is judged by the same standard. \"E.g. Rom 2:13; 2Cor 5:10; Mt 25:31-46. For the theme of weighing deeds in Paul and Palestinian Jewish literature, and an argument to the effect that \"weighing\" does not, as it does in TAb, constitute soteriology in other literature, see Sanders, Paul and Palestinian Judaism, pp. 128-47 , 515-88, 543. 33 See A10:14and n. 34 The full evidence was set out by Turner; see n. 5 above. When one takes into account the probable date of composition, the late redactional activity, and the full evidence of the dependence of TAb on the NT in at least three places, it becomes impossible to accept the view of C. W. Fishburne, \"ICor. iii 10-15 and the Testament of Abraham,\" NTS 17 (1970) 109-15, that Paul used TAb A13:13. Fishburne did not have access to Turner's study, nor did he note the numerous late elements in TAb A."},{"pageNumber":932,"pageContent":"Relation to canonical books Almost nothing of the Old Testament appears in the Testament of Abraham except the obvious references to Abraham in Genesis (see Al:5; 3:6; 4:11; 6:4; 8:5-7; see also 13:8; 11:12; B2:8-10; 6:10-13; see also 5:1). Recension A, as we now have it, has been influenced by the wording of the New Testament in at least three places (see All:2, 10f.; 13:13 and nn.).54 Recension B may also have been influenced by the wording of Matthew 7:13,55 although the image of two gates probably does not depend on Matthew. Genre and relation to other Jewish and Christian literature The Testament of Abraham is not properly a testament.56 Michael, at God's behest, instructs Abraham to make testamentary disposition of his goods, but no testament is made and there are no last words of advice to his son, although Isaac figures in the story. Nor is there any direct paraenesis, although the value of doing good works and avoiding evil is made prominent. The tour of earth and the view of the judgment are related to numerous other views of heaven, hell, the afterlife, and the like, which are usually called \"apocalypses\" or \"ascensions.\" The third principal part of the work concerns Abraham's reluctance to die and a description of how his soul is taken. There are parallels to this motif, especially in stories about Moses. The purpose of the book appears to be this: The author was concerned to present the judgment scene, in order to stress the value of good works, the efficacy of repentance, and God's justice and mercy, and in order to reconcile and depict the various images of judgment— by fire, balance, and deeds written in books. He chose as his medium a narrative that plays on the testamentary motif in order to provide an introduction: Michael goes to Abraham to advise him that it is time to draw up a will in view of his impending death. The author employs the theme of resisting death, borrowed from Moses traditions, as the occasion of Abraham's being given a tour of earth and subsequently a view of the judgment. Thus the judgment scene is central, and the other two principal motifs are employed to introduce it and provide a setting for it. The only real connection with the testamentary literature is the emphasis on one virtue. Just as Job exemplifies endurance and charity, Abraham exemplifies hospitality. The reluctance of the seer to die, as well as the connection of this motif with a vision, probably comes from Moses traditions. The exegetical base for the connection between resistance to death and revelations about the world to come seems to be Deuteronomy 34:1-4, which the earliest Midrashim interpret thus: God shows Moses \"all the land\" in compensation for not letting him enter, after Moses had protested the restriction. The rabbis understand the vision of the land to include its historical future: Moses saw the Temple and \"the whole land\" from the time of creation until the resurrection of the dead; while \"the city of palm trees\" (Deut 34:3) is understood to mean that Moses saw Paradise and the righteous leisurely strolling in it.57 The Mekilta also mentions in this connection that God showed Abraham the land and some of its future history.58 In later Midrashim, Moses is depicted as having been given a tour of heaven and hell, conducted by angels.59 It may be that the motif of Michael's coming for Abraham's soul is also dependent on Moses traditions, and it is likely that a now lost \"Assumption of Moses\" told of Michael's being sent to bury Moses, Satan's opposition, and Michael's victory.60 There is a twofold scene of Moses' disposition: His soul is taken to heaven and his body buried.61 Moses' protest of death and his being given a view of the other world have a better exegetical grounding and are more widespread than the story about Abraham, and it is likely that Moses traditions influenced the Testament of Abraham. 55 See B8 n. e. 56 See recently Nickelsburg, SCS 6, pp. 85-88; A. Kolenkow, SCS 6, pp. 139-52. 57 SifDeut357 (to34:lf.). 58 Mek Amalek 2 (Lauterbach, vol. 2, pp. 151-54). 59 See GedMos; \"The Revelation of Moses,\" by M.

It is not unlikely that these Moses traditions also influenced the stories about Adam and Eve in ApMos."},{"pageNumber":933,"pageContent":"There are, however, other stories about Abraham's being conducted on a heavenly tour or being shown a vision of the afterlife. In connection with the promise to Sarah (not, it is to be noted, in connection with Abraham's death), Pseudo-Philo wrote that God showed Abraham a vision of the place of fire for punishing the wicked and the torches for enlightening the righteous.62 On the occasion of the sacrifice mentioned in Genesis 15:17 (again, not his death), the Apocalypse of Abraham 15-29 describes a heavenly tour in which Abraham sees the seven heavens and some historical events. There is a similar story in Targum Neophiti at the same point.63 There are numerous other stories of ascensions and heavenly tours, but it still appears most likely that the author, in connecting a protest against death with a heavenly tour, was principally indebted to the Moses traditions.64 The heavenly tour of the Testament of Abraham must be distinguished from other \"ascensions\" and \"apocalypses.\" It is not a tour of the different layers of heaven (usually seven), nor is it a tour of the place of repose of the righteous and the punishment of the wicked. It is a view primarily of the place of judgment to which souls go for sentencing. Thus the work lacks the paraenetic purpose of other \"tour\" works, which describe the awful torment of the damned and the bliss of the righteous. The testament of Abraham is also related to works that give an account of the departure of the soul and the burial of the body, such as the Apocalypse of Moses, the Testament of Job, and the lost Assumption of Moses. Other comparisons and contrasts are cited in the notes. Some of the themes—that angels do not eat, the heavenly tour, the departure of the soul and its ascent—are so widespread that direct influence is impossible to determine. The Testament of Abraham, however, does seem to have been used by the author of the Christian Apocalypse of Paul. Note, for example, God's repeated statement in chapters 4, 5, and 6 that his \"patience bears with them until they are converted and repent\" (cf. TAb A10:14; B12:13). It also appears to have been used by the author of the Christian Apocalypse of Sedrach. Other parallels are cited in the notes. 62 Ps-Philo, LAB 23:6. 63 See Delcor, Le Testament d'Abraham, p. 39. Delcor (p. 41) regards this as the point of departure for the story in TAb. 64 In this as in many other matters it is difficult to decide whether one tradition influenced another or whether similar stories arose spontaneously. The date of the final redaction of the materials is not always decisive. In the present case, the final redaction of the materials in which the Moses stories appear is probably later than the date of the original composition of TAb. The arguments in favor in TAb's dependence on Moses traditions are as follows: The other Abraham traditions about a vision or heavenly tour do not connect it with a protest against death, while this is the standard connection in the Moses traditions; the connection of protest with tour or vision arises naturally from the biblical story of Moses' protest in Deut 34; although the earliest sources for the Moses tradition (SifDeut and Clement of Alexandria) are to be dated at the end of the 2nd cent., it is noteworthy that essentially the same tradition appears in both Palestine and Egypt; finally, Clement was drawing on an early (but now lost) work, while the exegesis of Deut 34:1 in SifDeut almost certainly antedates the final redaction of SifDeut."},{"pageNumber":934,"pageContent":"BIBLIOGRAPHY Charlesworth, PMR, pp. 70-72.

All the years of his life he lived in quietness, gentleness, and righteousness, and the righteous man was very 2 hospitable: • For he pitched his tent at the crossroads of the oak of Mamre3 and bSot ioa welcomed everyone—rich and poor, kings and rulers, the crippled and the helpless, friends and strangers, neighbors and passersby—(all) on equal terms did the pious, 3 entirely holy, righteous, and hospitable Abraham welcome. »But even to him came the common and inexorable bitter cup of death and the unforeseen end of life. 4 Therefore the Master God called his archangel Michaelb and said to him, \"Com­mander-in-chief0 Michael, go down to Abraham and tell him about his death, so 5 that he may arrange for the disposition*1 of his possessions. 'For I have blessed him as the stars of heaven and as the sand by the seashore, and he lives in abundance, (having) a large livelihood and many possessions, and he is very rich.6 But above all others he is righteous in all goodness, (having been) hospitablef and loving until 6 the end of his life. #But you, archangel Michael, go to Abraham, my beloved 7 friend,8 announce his death to him, and give him this assurance, #tAt this time you are about to leave this vain world and depart from the body, and you will come to your own Masterh among the good.' \" 1 2 So the Commander-in-chief left the presence of God and went down to Abraham at the oak of Mamre, and he found the righteous Abraham in the nearby field, sitting beside yokes of plow oxen with the sons of Masek3 and other servants, 2 twelve in number. And behold the Commander-in-chief came toward him. •When Abraham saw the Commander-in-chief Michael coming from afar, in the manner of a handsome soldier, then Abraham arose and met him, just as was his custom 3 to greet and welcome all strangers.6 »And the Commander-in-chief saluted him and said, \"Hail, honored father, righteous soul elect of God, true friend of the 4 heavenly One.\" #And Abraham said to the Commander-in-chief, \"Hail, honored soldier, bright as the sun and most handsome, more than all the sons of men.

'Then Sarah beckoned Abraham to come to the door (and step) outside, and she said to him, \"My lord 3 Abraham, do you know who this man is?\" • Abraham said, \"I do not know.\" 4 Sarah said, \"You must know, my lord, the three heavenly men who stayed as guests3 in our tent beside the oak of Mamre when you slaughtered the unblemished Gen i8:i-8 5 calf and set a table for them. • After the meat had been eaten, the calf got up again and exultantly suckled its mother.

ApPaul 4, 5,6 (\"bear with them ... so that\"). The idea that God postpones the punishment of sins in order to allow time for repentance is relatively widespread: Rom 2:4; 3:25; WisSol 11:23; 12:10; Philo, LegAll 01.106; cf. the rabbinic view that God postpones the deserved punishment of the world for the sake of the patriarchs (Sifra Behuqqotai pereq 8:7; to Lev 26:42).

The commentators correctly note that the theme of two ways is a common feature of Jewish literature. The verbatim agreement between this passage and Mt 7:13f., however, is marked: the combination of \"gate\" and \"way,\" the use of precisely the same four adjectives (steni, tethlim-rnene, plateia, and eurochoros), and the phrases that appear later in this chapter, \"which leads to life\" and \"which leads to destruction.\" The com­pact and balanced form of Mt could hardly have been derived from TAb; and in view of other evi­dence of verbatim agreement between TAb A and the NT, the dependence of the former on the latter here seems indisputable.

The imagery of weighing deeds, as distinct from this graphic description of weighing souls, is very widespread. In Jewish literature, see e.g. IEn 41:1; 4Ezra 3:34 (of nations); 2En 52:15 (combining balance and books). See further Pearson, SCS 6, pp. 244,249-53. On the theme in rabbinic material, see Sanders, Paul and Palestinian Judaism, pp. 128-47. For evidence that emphasis on the strict weighing of deeds is closer to Iranian than rabbinic thought, see D. Winston, \"The Iranian Component in the Bible, Apocrypha, and Qumran,\" History of Religions 5 (1966) 195, n. 33. The depiction of weighing souls, however, is generally considered Egyptian; see Delcor ad loc.; Schmidt, Le Testa­ment d'Abraham, vol. 1, pp. 72-76 (Egyptian, somewhat altered); Turner, The Testament of Abra­ham, pp. 177-85. g. Fire as a means of testing, as distinct from being the means of punishing sinners, is not so common a judgment theme as weighing and re­cording. It is, however, indicated in such passages as Ps 66:10-12 (65:10-12 LXX): \"You tested us, God, you refined us like silver ... but now the ordeal by fire and water is over.\" Here \"test\" is dokimazd, the word used in TAb. So also Zech 13:9; Jer 6:29; WisSol 3:6. For refining by fire, see Mai 3:2. The image of testing (dokimazd) by fire is picked up by Paul (ICor 3:13-15) and in IPet 1:7 (cf. also IPet 4:12, \"for a test,\" peirasmos). For refining by fire, see Rev 3:18. The theme as such is readily explicable in TAb as an independent use of the motif of testing by fire, although the precise wording in 13:13 below seems to have been influenced by ICor. h.

The final judgment will be held by God when he comes; thus the traditional view of the judgment is combined with judgment of individuals immediately after death. On God's coming, see 2En 32:1 (where it implies the resurrection). The final judgment is not connected with the word parousia in LXX, although it is linked with God's coming; e.g. Mai 3:2, eisodos. Parousia (usually of Christ) is frequently linked with judgment in the NT: e.g. IThes 4:15; Un 2:28; for parousia used of God, see Jas 5:7; 2Pet 3:12. The term was probably more common in Jewish literature than can now be directiy demonstrated. b. For the assignment of individual souls to torment or bliss immediately after death, without waiting for the resurrection, see ApAb 21. c. This brings in and modifies another traditional motif: the judgment of gentiles by Israel (or of the wicked by the righteous, in which case the righteous could be understood as Israel): Dan 7:22 LXX: \"He gave the judgment to the saints of the Most High,\" i.e. to Israel; Jub 32:19: \"They (Israel) shall judge all the nations . . .\"; WisSol 3:8: \"They (the righteous) shall judge (the) Gentiles\" (ethne); IQpHab 5.4: \"God will give the judgment of the Gentiles (goyim) into the hands of his elect\"; cf. 1QS 5.6f.; 1QH 4.26; 1QM 6.6; 11.13f.; ApAb 22:29. The theme is applied to the disciples in Mt 19:28, which helps attest to its existence as a Jewish theme of judgment. The present passage in TAb is the only reference to Israel in the work. d.

STINESPRING This document commemorates Isaac on a fixed day in the Coptic Church calendar. Sometimes a narrator speaks, sometimes Isaac himself. After the Trinitarian formula is stated, Isaac delivers a brief homily on the futility of the worldly life and the glorious, eternal rewards promised to the faithful. Then God sends the archangel Michael to Isaac to announce the approaching end of the patriarch's life. Isaac is willing to go but is concerned about Jacob. The angel assures him that all will be well with Jacob, from whom twelve tribes will come forth. Michael departs and Isaac informs Jacob of what is about to happen. Jacob is disturbed and wishes to accompany his father. Isaac explains that God's decrees cannot be changed, and tells Jacob of his great ancestry from Adam on, and of his great future as progenitor of the twelve tribes and ultimately of Jesus the Messiah, son of the Virgin Mary and incarnation of God. At this point the narrator tells of the extreme asceticism of Isaac, such as his frequent fasting and praying night and day, also his abstention from meat and fruit and his refusal to sleep on a bed. A crowd gathers and Isaac delivers a lengthy homily on the strict obligations incumbent on all who are devout, and especially on all priests, among whom Isaac includes himself. After this an angel comes and takes Isaac for a preliminary visit to the next world. He is shown hell and some of the horrible tortures being inflicted on sinners, especially those who have died still in enmity with others. Soon he declares that he cannot endure the sight of any more horrors. The angel takes him to heaven, where he sees his father Abraham and many saints. They lead him up to a curtain, behind which is the throne of God. God utters a few words of welcome to Isaac, but most of the conversation is between God and Abraham. God emphasizes that he is very compassionate and forgiving to all who earnestly try to live a good life. The conversation concluded, God orders Michael to bring a delegation of angels and saints, along with the chariot of the seraphim. With the cherubim and angels going ahead, they descend to bring Isaac back. Again Jacob is disturbed and needs to be reassured. Then the Lord takes Isaac's soul, white and pure as snow, to heaven in the holy chariot, with the cherubim and angels singing before it. The narrator ends by describing the delights of heaven, exhorting the readers to celebrate the special day of Isaac, and affirming the eternal nature of the Holy Trinity.

Original language, date, and provenance The Testament of Isaac is now extant only in the languages listed above, all from the area south of the Mediterranean. Unlike the Testament of Abraham, it is not extant in Greek or in the northern versions, Romanian and Slavic. The dependence on the Testament of Abraham, however, makes it possible that the Testament of Isaac was originally written in Greek, shortly after the Testament of Abraham and in the same milieu. There are pronounced Christian elements in the Testament of Isaac as it now stands, and in its present form it has the function of emphasizing the date of the deaths of Abraham and Isaac as commemorated in the Coptic Church. Thus it would be possible to see the work as springing from the Coptic Christian Church. The Christianizing is not thoroughgoing, however, and it seems more likely that the original composition was a product of Egyptian Judaism. Historical and theological importance The Testament of Isaac maintains the universalism of the Testament of Abraham (see 2:9, \"fathers to all the world\"), and the admonitions concerning proper behavior remain quite general. (See, for example, 4:11-54.) It is also noteworthy that Jacob is called \"the father of many nations\" as well as of the twelve tribes (2:22), despite the wording of the Bible, which limits Jacob's progeny to the twelve tribes of Israel. Thus, assuming that the Testament of Isaac was originally Jewish, it represents very much the same values as are represented by the Testament of Abraham: Men should set their houses in order in preparation for death, they should live good moral lives, they should remember the judgment, but they should forget neither the mercy of God nor the need that they themselves be merciful."},{"pageNumber":958,"pageContent":"THE TESTAMENT OF ISAAC 1 In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, the One God.

STINESPRING After the statement of the Trinitarian formula, the narrator begins a commemoration of Jacob on the same day set aside in the church calendar to honor Isaac. As in the case of Isaac, the Lord sends the archangel Michael to Jacob to announce his imminent demise. Jacob, accustomed to speaking with angels, replies that he is ready to die, now that he has been able to come to Egypt to see and enjoy his son Joseph once more (Gen 46:30). After an interval, another angel, resembling Isaac, appears and somewhat frightens Jacob. Then the heavenly visitor identifies himself as Jacob's guardian angel, who has already saved him from Laban, Esau, and various dangers, and will continue to see that all will be well. The angel departs, with Jacob's confidence restored. Jacob then requires Joseph to swear that he will take his body back to the land of Canaan to be buried in the ancestral tomb (Gen 47:29-31). Next the narrator relates the story of the blessing of Ephraim and Manasseh (Gen 48), followed by a condensed version of Jacob's blessing on his twelve sons (Gen 49). Then, like Isaac, Jacob is taken up for a preliminary tour of the next world, first to hell with all its horrors, afterward to heaven with all its bliss. He returns to earth and dies at the age of 147 years. The Lord and his angels come down and take his soul to heaven. Joseph orders his body embalmed in the Egyptian manner. Many days of mourning ensue (Gen 50:2f.). Then follows the great procession of Israelites and Egyptians to the land of Canaan to bury Jacob's body (Gen 50:4-14). In conclusion, the narrator presents his own views and advice. He recommends reading the Torah, written by Moses (sic), and imitating the patriarchs in one's own life to avoid the tortures of hell. Much prayer and fasting are necessary, likewise alms .freely given out of mercy and compassion. Such living will drive away demons. Avoid danger, depravity, and all sexual immorality, including homosexuality. Honor the patriarchs every year on their special day. Finally, all we weak sinners will have urgent need of intercessors in heaven on the day of judgment. We must plead for mercy before Jesus the Messiah, who is both judge and helper. Our best intercessors will be the Virgin Mary, \"mistress of intercessions\" and \"mother of salvation,\" also the martyrs and saints and all who have pleased the Lord with pious deeds.

PRIEST The Testament of Moses is the farewell exhortation given by Moses to his chosen successor Joshua just prior to the leader's death and Israel's entrance into the promised land. Apart from a few responses of Joshua, which serve to facilitate the flow of Moses' speech, the format is a predictive delineation of the history of the people from their entrance into Canaan until the end of days. In summary fashion, Moses outlines the conquest (2:1-2), the time of the judges and the united kingdom (2:3-4), and the period of the divided kingdoms (2:5-9). Chapter 3 speaks of the fall of Jerusalem (3:1-3) and the reunion of all Israel in the land of their exile (3:4-14). Next, Moses foretells the return from captivity (4:1-6) and the rebuilding of Jerusalem (4:7-9). The return is, however, followed by a renewed apostasy (5:1-6; 7:1-9). Those responsible for this apostasy are usually considered to be the hellenizing priests of the Seleucid period (175-165 B.C.) and/or the priest-kings of the Hasmonean era (142-37 B.C.). The consequence of these evil deeds is the partial destruction of the Temple (6:9), and the torture, imprisonment, and death of the faithful (6:3-9; 8:1-5). An episode that appears to be the culmination of this historical survey tells of the resolve of a Levite and his seven sons to die rather than betray their ancestral faith (9:1-7). There follows an eschatological hymn that portrays the destruction of the evil one at the hands of Israel's guardian angel (10:1-2), cataclysmic cosmic events (10:3-6), and the exaltation of Israel in the end of days (10:7-10). Finally, there is a dialogue between Moses and Joshua in which the latter questions his own ability to lead the people and laments that Moses' death will encourage Israel's enemies to attack, once they believe that his presence will no longer protect the chosen people (11:1-12:1). Moses, however, assures Joshua that God is in complete control of all that is and will be (12:1-5). It is his will and mercy, not the merit of Moses, that have guarded the people up to now (12:6-7), and the same will suffice in the days of Joshua (12:8-9). The concluding verses exhort faithfulness to the commandments, promising good to those who fulfill them and evil to those who disregard them (12:10-11), and affirm that, in spite of all hazards, a nucleus of God's people will survive in accord with the covenant promises made long ago (12:12-13). At this point, in the middle of a sentence, there is a break in the text and the remaining contents of the document are lost. Text The sole extant copy of our text is a Latin palimpsest discovered by A. M. Ceriani in the Ambrosian Library in Milan in 1861.

The preserved text is clearly incomplete with perhaps one third to one half being lost. There are gaps in those"},{"pageNumber":973,"pageContent":"sections that do remain, and in many places the writing is scarcely legible.1 Further, it is apparent that either the Latin translator or the copyist, or both, were careless in both spelling and grammar. Consequently, editors and translators have had to resort to many emendations and reconstructions. Original language It was apparent to the first editors of the text that the Latin was translated from Greek. A few Greek words appear as transliterations, certain syntactical constructions clearly reflect a Greek background, and some difficult passages may be clarified by reconstructing the Greek that underlies the Latin. Most of the first editors and translators assumed that the original language was indeed Greek. Further investigation, however, indicates that the Greek itself was, in all probability, a translation of a Semitic original. This view is almost universally accepted today, but there remains a question as to whether the original was Aramaic or Hebrew. Certainty is not possible, but the balance of probability leans toward Hebrew.2 That the text is a translation of a translation further complicates the problem for modern translators as will be indicated in some of the notes. Date Widely differing estimates have been proposed for the date of the document, but these may be classified into three broad categories: (1) in the first half of the second century A.D., most likely in the period just following the war of A.D. 132-135; (2) during the period of the Maccabean revolt, i.e. 168-165 B.C.; and (3) in the first century A.D., before the fall of Jerusalem in A.D. 70 and most likely during the first three decades of that century. The first option has been most vigorously argued by S. Zeitlin,3 but though many of his arguments deserve careful attention, they fail to carry conviction as a whole. The second option has most recently been proposed by J. Licht4 and adopted especially by G. Nickelsburg.5 The thrust of Licht's argument rests on his theological interpretation of the role of Taxo in chapter 9 and of the eschatological hymn in chapter 10. Nickelsburg accepts this position but develops more intricate arguments for the Maccabean dating. He bases his position on a form-critical analysis of the document as a whole and on the apparent description of the persecutions of Antiochus IV Epiphanes in chapter 8. He believes that the vividness of this description indicates that the persecution was contemporary with the author. However, chapter 6 contains a serious difficulty for a Maccabean dating as there is near universal agreement that Herod's reign and death are there referred to. This would mean that the text, in its present form, could not have been written before 4 B.C. Licht and Nickelsburg solve this problem by suggesting that chapter 6, and perhaps chapter 7, are interpolations into a document that had its origin in the Maccabean period. The arguments for a date in the first century A.D., before A.D. 70, were stated in their fullest form by R. H. Charles.6 His main points were that the date must be (1) before A.D. 70, since the Temple is still standing (1:17); (2) after 4 B.C., since Herod is already dead (4:6); (3) before A.D. 30, since it is stated that Herod will beget heirs who will reign for shorter periods than he (6:7), i.e. less than his reign of thirty-four years; and (4) after A.D. 7 since he supposed that the text implies that Archelaus has already been deposed. 1 D. H. Wallace, in private correspondence, has indicated that all technological efforts to restore illegible portions of the text have thus far resulted in failure. 2 See the discussions in E. M.

Since he believed that in those chapters the author was describing historical events with chronological consistency, the references to Herod's reign in chapters 6 and 7 should follow chapters 8 and 9, which reflect the persecutions of Antiochus IV Epiphanes. Concluding that at some stage of transmission there was dislocation, he solved the problem by inserting chapters 8 and 9 between 5 and 6, thus restoring what he presumed to be the original order.7 Although this proposal has been widely accepted, it is cogent only if one assumes that contemporary canons of consistency must apply to an apocalyptic author. Rejection of Charles's theory on this point does not, however, affect his overall argument for a first-century A.D. date, while acceptance of the interpolation proposal is mandatory for a Maccabean dating. The possibility of interpolation is not to be dismissed arbitrarily. Indeed, it is probable that the text has a long and obscure literary history, which includes additions, interpolations, and other forms of editing. The fragmentary, often untrustworthy, nature of the Latin, itself one language removed from the Semitic original, precludes operating with the critical precision implicit in any specific theory of interpolation, dislocation, or rearrangement. Consequently, it is better to retain the first-century date of the document, with the recognition that some of the materials may have had a considerable prior history in either oral or written form. Provenance and historical importance The geographical locale of the Testament of Moses has elicited little discussion by commentators. A few have tentatively proposed a Western, probably Roman origin, but most assume a Palestinian locale. Though specific evidence is lacking, the latter proposal is probably correct. The question of the community to which the author belonged has prompted a wide variety of answers. At one time or another almost every well-known Jewish religious group from the Sadducees to the Samaritans has been suggested.8 Three suggestions seem to warrant serious consideration: (1) the rather amorphous group called the Hasidim, known to us to have been a party from Maccabean times at least; (2) a branch of the Pharisaic party; and (3) the Essenes. Two difficulties, neither insurmountable, appertain to the first suggestion. Information about the Hasidim is too general in nature to isolate specific features that might separate them ideologically; and it is generally agreed that from the first century B.C. onward the general Hasidic movement became focused in more clearly defined sectarian groups. The question of the date of the Testament of Moses, therefore, is significant in determining the group in which it originated. A Maccabean date would be appropriate for the general Hasidic movement while the first century A.D. date would require a more specific identification. Charles presented the most forceful argument for a Pharisaic origin. He insisted that the author was a Pharisaic quietist who was resisting a growing nationalistic tendency within the party. Charles also noted the continuity between the outlook of the author and of the old Hasidic ideals. The majority of commentators since Charles have accepted his position. A few early commentators suggested that the book came from Essene circles and the discovery of the Qumran and related materials resulted in fresh adherents to this opinion. There are, indeed, many parallels between the Qumran materials and the Testament of Moses. Some of these will be found in the notes. That no fragments of the work have been identified at Qumran is a serious, though by no means decisive, objection to the Essene theory. Some may subsequently be identified, and there is no reason to suppose that the entire corpus of Essene literature has been preserved. The Testament of Moses does appear to have closer affinities with the Essenes than with any other known group in the Judaism of the period. There is increasing evidence, however, that the Judaism of this period was quite complex. It would appear unwise, therefore, to insist on the identification of every document with a 8 For a convenient review, see Laperrousaz, Testament, pp. 88-95.

It seems preferable not to assign to the Testament of Moses either a Pharisaic or an Essene origin but to state simply that it reflects the general outlook of the later Hasidic movement with a stress on apocalyptic motifs. Whether this was an individual or sectarian view cannot be ascer­tained.10 Theological importance E. Laperrousaz has rightly remarked that the theology of the Testament of Moses is not very original.11 Fundamentally, the theology reflects apocalyptic determinism although the Deuteronomic view that evildoers will be punished and the righteous will be rewarded is also present (12:10-11). This somewhat paradoxical combination is not unknown in other works of the period. The deterministic theme, however, is dominant. All that has happened in the past was determined by God and revealed to Moses (3:11-12; 12:4-5). Thus, the promises of Moses that God's eschatological intervention is at hand (10:1-12) and that his covenant promises will not fail (12:3-13, and see below) may be received with full assurance. This, of course, is a primary purpose of apocalyptic, to give hope to those who are oppressed and in despair. The Testament of Moses fully shares that purpose. The central argument for the assertion of Israel's final hope lies in the author's conviction that the covenant promises of God are certain (cf. 1:8-9; 3:9; 4:2-6; 12:7-13). Moses asserts that just as the guidance in the wilderness was not due to his strength (12:7) nor the impending conquest due to the piety of the people (12:8), so the final deliverance would result solely from the action of God, predetermined by his covenant and oath (12:13). It has been claimed that the statement in 1:12 \"God has created the world on behalf of his people\" is not found in any work prior to the first century B.C. though it is found often in subsequent writings.12 Chronological priority may belong to our document, but whether the idea originated with the author of the Testament of Moses cannot be determined. Similarly, 1:14 says, \"But he did design and devise me, who (was) prepared from the beginning of the world, to be the mediator of his covenant.\" This has been cited as being original in speaking of Moses' pre-existence and in designating him as a mediator. It seems dubious that the text can bear the weight of claiming pre-existence for Moses as a person, though this is not impossible since such a claim may have been made for the Son of Man in 1 Enoch (see especially 48:2, 3, 6; 62:7) and 4 Ezra (especially 12:32; 13:26) and since some Alexandrian Jewish circles taught the pre-existence of all souls. It seems wiser simply to say that our author, consistent with his thorough determinism, stated that Moses' role had been decreed from the beginning of the world. Whether he believed that Moses himself was \"precreated\" is not clear. Moses' decreed role is clearly that of mediator. It is true that in the Old Testament Moses is not called a mediator and that the word occurs only in Job 9:33, but many narratives portray him in that role and the designation is quite well known in other documents of the first century A.D. (e.g. Gal 3:18; Heb 8:6; 9:15; 12:21; Philo, Vita Mos 3:19). Again, chronological priority may reside with the Testament of Moses, but it is probably too much to claim originality. Both the ideas of pre-existence and the designation of Moses as a mediator were in the air at the time. One passage, the story of Taxo and his seven sons (ch. 9) warrants a more detailed examination. Not here applicable is whether its significance belongs properly to the issue of theological importance, historical importance, or relation to apocryphal works; that issue 9 Charles, Assumption, p. liv, and APOT, vol. 2, p. 411, felt required to subdivide the Pharisees and speak of the author as a \"quietistic Pharisee.\" Laperrousaz, Testament, p. 95, argues for Essene origin but notes that the author was an Essene with particular qualities. The necessity of such qualifications damages attempts to make clear positive identifications. 10 M. Smith, in Palestinian Parties and Politics that Shaped the Old Testament (New York, 1971) p. 157, suggests that the author of TMos founded a sect that declared all sacrifices of the second Temple impure (see 5:4-5). The evidence is somewhat tenuous. 11 Laperrousaz, Testament, p. 80. For convenient summaries of the theology of TMos as a whole, see Laperrousaz, Testament, pp. 80-87; Charles, Assumption, pp. Iviii-lxi, and APOT, vol. 2, pp. 411-12. 12 Other views, that the world was created for the righteous, e.g. 2Bar 14:19; 15:7; 21:24; 4Ezra 9:13; or for all mankind, e.g. 4Ezra 8:1, 44, are also common."},{"pageNumber":976,"pageContent":"is problematical and results perhaps from an arbitrary division. Most scholars who have dealt with Taxo attempted to decipher the cryptic name and thus identify him historically. Their ingenuity is impressive but not very productive.13 Focus on the function of Taxo rather than on historical identification is a more fruitful angle of approach. C. J. Lattey suggested that Taxo be understood as the suffering Messiah whose appearance and death bring about the divine consummation.14 The methods by which the name Taxo is made to refer to the Messiah are too oblique to convince many of the identification, but an understanding of Taxo as the one who precipitates the divine vengeance that inaugurates the end-time has recently gained considerable support.15 It has been maintained that the death of Taxo and his sons was intended to provoke the divine vengeance and thus be the instrument provoking the onset of the eschatological age. The death of Taxo and his sons will \"compel God to exercise His vengeance.\"16 Comparison of the story of Taxo and his sons with other accounts of martyrdom in contemporary documents, particularly 1,2, and 4 Maccabees, raises questions about this conclusion. There the reasons for and the results of martyrdom are by no means consistent. In some cases the martyrs are innocent, in others they suffer for their own sins. Their deaths may be simply exemplary, they may lead to restoration of life, or they may serve as a vicarious expiation for the sinful community. It should be noted that even when expiation is mentioned, there is no eschatological dimension envisaged.17 It might, nevertheless, be argued that the role of a righteous sufferer as provoking divine vengeance is a unique teaching in the Testament of Moses. This is possible, but the text does not demand such an interpretation. It is more likely that the author has used a typical martyr story to introduce his pronouncement of the end of time. He has included in the story motifs, known to us elsewhere, of God's avenging innocent suffering and, perhaps, has hinted at the idea of vicarious propitiation, although this is not clear. That he has set forth a unique teaching that Taxo's innocent suffering is the act that provokes the divine vengeance that leads to the consummation of the end-time seems to require much more than the text will bear. Taxo is better seen as a singular example of the extreme woes that will beset God's people in the last days than as one who plays a significant part in precipitating the advent of those days. That the Testament of Moses proclaims divine vengeance is not to be denied. That Taxo is the instrument of that divine vengeance remains unproved. For the author of the Testament of Moses, God alone is the worker of his predetermined will. Relation to canonical books The most obvious relationship between the Testament of Moses and the Hebrew canon is with Deuteronomy, especially chapters 31 to 34 of that book. The basic outline of the Testament of Moses follows the pattern of those chapters to such an extent that the Testament of Moses may be considered a virtual rewriting of them.18 This is true not only with respect to general outline but also regarding specific allusions and theological perspective. Deuter­onomy 31-34 is clearly the author's model, though he has recast his own work in light of the history of the people from the conquest to his own day and through the prism of his own apocalyptic outlook. Influence by other canonical books is much more difficult to assess. Attention has been drawn to possible relationships between the Testament of Moses and Daniel. Most com­mentators conclude that the person in the Testament who prays for the people at 4:1 is Daniel and note the passage in Daniel 4:4-19. Further, parallels between the judgment scene in Darnel 12 and the hymn in Testament of Moses 10 have been cited. It is probable that the 13 Convenient summaries of this interesting episode in the history of scholarship may be found in Rowley, Relevance, pp. 149-56; Zeitlin, JQR 38 (1947/48) 4-5. 14 C. J. Lattey, \"The Messianic Expectation in 'The Assumption of Moses,' \" CBQ 4 (1942) 9-21. 15 Licht, JJS 12 (1961) 95-103. Cf. n. 4 above. 16 Licht, JJS 12(1961)98. 17 For a more extensive treatment comparing the martyr stories, see J. Priest, Perspectives in Religious Studies 4 (1977) 99-103. The entire article, 92-111, elaborates a number of points alluded to in this introduction. 18 Nickelsburg, Resurrection, p. 29. The use of Deut 31-34 is so extensive that marginal references to biblical parallels in the translation will note only those that contain direct verbal allusions."},{"pageNumber":977,"pageContent":"identification of the prayer with Daniel is correct. This, however, would not necessarily mean that the author of the Testament of Moses was familiar with the book of Daniel but rather with certain Danielic traditions. There are enough differences between the judgment scenes in Daniel and the Testament of Moses to raise serious questions about the precise nature of their relationship.19 Thus, though it is probable that the author of the Testament of Moses was acquainted with the book of Daniel, it is not possible to assert definite dependence on his part. Allusions, both verbal and in thought, to a number of Old Testament books do appear in the Testament and will be noted in the references to the following translation. However, the Testament of Moses does not seem to reflect direct influence by any work other than Deuteronomy. It may be noted that priestly interests occur prominently but hardly as a reflection of any definite text. Some influence by the Testament of Moses on a number of New Testament passages has been suggested. Those most often cited are Jude 9, 12-13, 16; 2 Peter 2:13; Acts 7:36-43; and Matthew 24:19-21 (with parallels). Jude 9 refers to the story of the dispute between Michael and Satan for the body of Moses, an account that does not appear in our text. That the episode was contained in the lost ending of the Testament of Moses or in a cognate work, properly called the Assumption of Moses, is possible; but our present information does not warrant any positive conclusion. (The relation between a Testament of Moses and an Assumption of Moses will be discussed below.) Jude 12-13 utilizes nature metaphors reminiscent of Testament of Moses 10:5—620 and Jude 16 describes opponents in language similar to a number of passages in our document. In both instances, however, the contexts are quite different. Nevertheless, the strongest case for possible knowledge of the Testament of Moses by a New Testament writer is with the letter of Jude. The other proposals are not compelling. The possibility exists that some New Testament authors were familiar with the Testament of Moses, but it would be better to say that both the Testament of Moses and certain New Testament texts show familarity with common traditional material.21 Relation to apocryphal books Evidence for literary relations among apocryphal books is difficult to assess. Two factors, primarily, contribute to this difficulty. First is the problem of relative dating. There is far from universal agreement regarding the date of most works, and even the relative dates suggested may vary widely. Second, unless there is a direct reference linking two works together, there is the possibility, even probability, that similar passages represent a similar development of Old Testament passages or common sources rather than direct dependence of one on the other. Many phrases and themes in the Testament of Moses do have parallels in other apocryphal works, but they should probably be considered as parallel statements emanating from a common milieu. Evidence of dependence or acquaintance cannot be demonstrated. Since the view that the Testament of Moses is of Essene origin has been renewed,22 its relationship with the Qumran materials should be mentioned. There are, indeed, many instances of verbal similarities, particularly with CD and 1QH.23 Further, some of the polemic interests in the Qumran materials are also to be found in the Testament of Moses. But the overall theological perspective of the Testament of Moses differs so much at crucial junctures from the Qumran literature that it is difficult to see how it could be a product of the Qumran community, though it is not improbable that the author, given the date proposed here, could have been acquainted with the thought and perhaps some of the writings of that sect. 19 Nickelsburg, Resurrection, p. 30. 20 See the discussion by D. J. Rowton, \"The Most Neglected Book in the New Testament\" NTS 21 (1974/75) 558. 21 For detailed discussions, see Charles, Assumption, pp. lxii-lxv, and APOT, vol. 2, pp. 412f.; Laperrousaz, Testament, pp. 50-76. 22 E.g. by A. Dupont-Sommer, The Essene Writings from Qumran (Cleveland, 1967) p. 96, and the discussion in Laperrousaz, Testament, pp. 91-95. 23 A number of similarities will be referred to in the nn. on the translation. One Qumran text, 1QDM, could be of considerable interest, but the extant fragments show no particular connections with TMos. The editors remark that \"One may suppose that the composition ended with the death of Moses, and eventually his assumption\" (p. 91). Of this there is no textual evidence. See D. Barthelemy and J. T. Milik, Qumran Cave I (Oxford, 1955) pp. 91-97, and plates xviii-xix."},{"pageNumber":978,"pageContent":"Nevertheless, his own sectarian outlook did have its own peculiar development. And again, a common milieu may account for the apparent parallels. Finally, apocryphal works associated with the name of Moses are mentioned frequently in early Jewish and Christian sources.24 Precise identification is often difficult or impossible. Of particular interest, however, are those references that speak of both an Assumption of Moses and a Testament of Moses. Both are mentioned in some lists of noncanonical books,25 and the former is specifically named in some early Greek and Latin writings.26 Other writings, though not specifically naming a source, cite material that would be appropriate to a work describing the death and assumption of Moses. Ceriani identified the present manuscript as the Assumption of Moses on the basis of a passage from the Acts of the Council of Nicea that appeared to cite 1:14, and perhaps parts of 1:6 and 1:9, as \"having been written in the book of the Assumption of Moses.\" Later on, the same text spoke of the struggle between the archangel Michael and the devil, which is known from other early texts to be a part of the Assumption of Moses, and again cited its source as \"book of the Assumption of Moses.\"27 Since his initial identification, the book has regularly been called the Assumption of Moses. Commentators on the manuscript discovered by Ceriani have regularly noted that the extant text nowhere mentions the assumption of Moses. Indeed all references to his impending death imply that it is to be a natural one (1:15; 3:3; 10:12, 14). The form of the present text is that of a farewell speech, or testament, which is a well-known genre in itself. Since the ancient lists recorded both an Assumption of Moses and a Testament of Moses, was Ceriani correct in identifying the manuscript as the Assumption or would it be more appropriate to infer that it is indeed the Testament? There is no unambiguous answer to this question. Since the extant manuscript is clearly incomplete it may be that the lost section did go on to tell of Moses' death and assumption. The evidence from the Acts of the Council of Nicea can be interpreted in this way. Charles proposed that there were originally two separate works, a testament and an assumption account, which were joined together at an early period and that subsequently the whole was referred to as the Assumption of Moses.28 This is an attractive suggestion but cannot be demonstrated. The matter remains open but since the only text we have is a farewell speech, a testament, most modern commentators prefer to refer to it as the Testament of Moses, and that is the practice followed in this work.

Lit. \"they will build a palisade, restoring the place.\" This is another clear attempt to render a Semitic original. e. \"Former\" is more properly translated \"given\" but this hardly changes the meaning. The crucial issue is whether the author rejects all sac­rifice in the second Temple or deplores the condi­tions in the second Temple as compared with the First. That the situation in the second Temple was deplored in works of the period is clear, cf. IEn 89:73; 2Bar 68:5-6; and many instances from Qum­ran and in PssSol. The evidence in TMos does not permit a definitive interpretation. That the second Temple was considered inferior to the first is a common theme in both biblical and extrabiblical writings and that TMos asserts more than this is not likely. f. The Lat. does not make sense and the trans­lation is an educated guess based on several emen­dations. 5 a. Ch. 5 probably refers to the Hasmonean period (142-63 B.C). This negative attitude toward the Hasmoneans is also found at Qumran but this need not mean that TMos and the Qumran literature emanate from the same group. Though there are many parallels, these should be attributed to a com­mon situation rather than to a common source. b.

Similar allu­sions in other works are also inconclusive. For example, CD 19.11 = 7.21 mentions a \"first\" or \"former\" punishment (Heb. pqdh, which probably lies behind the Lat. here), but this has been variously interpreted as an allusion to the fall of Jerusalem in 587 B.C, the Antiochan persecution, the capture of Jerusalem by Pompey in 63 B.C, or to some otherwise unknown historical event. It seems better to assume that the author has put together many past events that he believes are about to be replicated in the end-time. See also the n. on 9:2 below. b. The verb translated \"deny\" has been emended from necantes (\"to kill or slay\") to ne-gantes as a parallel to confitentes (\"confess\"), but another emendation would yield the parallelism \"conceal and reveal.\" c. The reading, if correct, probably refers to sacred prostitution (cf. 2Mac 6:4). The text is often emended to read \"will be violently given to the nations\" (cf. 2Mac 5:24). The general sense is the same as slavery might well involve prostitution. d. The text of these two vss. is very uncertain.

The text Mo dicente (\"even as he was speak­ing\") is usually emended to Mo die (\"in that day\"), and this may well be correct.

DULING The Testament of Solomon is a haggadic-type folktale about Solomon's building the Temple of Jerusalem combined with ancient lore about magic, astrology, angelology, demonology, and primitive medicine. According to the majority of manuscripts, the testament begins with the story of Solomon's favorite, a boy who inspires the artisans of the Temple, but whose soul is being sucked out of him by a pesky demon, Ornias. In response to Solomon's prayer to God for aid, the archangel Michael grants Solomon a magic seal ring by which he is able to call up the demons, to interrogate them as to their names, astrological locations, demonic activities (pains, diseases, immoral deeds), to compel them to reveal their thwarting angels, and to enlist their help with the construction of the Temple. Thus, Solomon learns that the pesky demon is named Ornias, is located in Aquarius, can undergo several transformations (strangler of those who are located under Aquarius; a man who craves bodies of effeminate boys; a heavenly, winged creature), and is thwarted by the archangel Ouriel. With Ouriel's help, Ornias is sentenced to cut stone in the stone quarry and, with the aid of the ring, to go and get Beelzeboul, the Prince of Demons (chs. 1-3). Beelzeboul is interrogated and promises to bring forth the unclean spirits bound. Beelzeboul shows Solomon Onoskelis, a cliff-dwelling satyra, who associates with men and travels by the full moon; she is commanded to spin hemp for construction ropes (ch. 4). Beelzeboul brings forth the impertinent Asmodeus, who is the Great Bear constellation, who spreads the wickedness of men, hatches plots against newly weds, spreads madness about women through the stars, and commits murders; Solomon learns that Asmodeus is thwarted by the angel Raphael and smoke from a burning liver and gall of a fish (ch. 5). Solomon learns that Beelzeboul is a fallen angel who destroys by means of tyrants, causes demons to be worshiped, arouses desires in holy men, brings about jealousies and murders, and instigates wars. Beelzeboul prophesies about the Arabian wind demon Ephippas (chs. 22-24), tells that he is thwarted by the Almighty God and the oath \"the Elo-i,\" and informs Solomon about heavenly things; he is commanded to cut marble (ch. 6). Solomon interrogates the wind demon Lix Tetrax, learns that he creates divisions among men, makes whirlwinds, starts fires, disrupts households, is the offspring of the Great One, has a star near the tip of the southern moon, and is thwarted by the archangel Azael; he is commanded to hurl stones up to the heights of the Temple for the workmen (ch. 7). Solomon interrogates the seven heavenly bodies (Deception, Strife, Fate, Distress, Error, Power, The Worst), learns of their evil activities and their thwarting angels (respectively, Lamechiel, Baruchiel, Marmaroth, Balthioul, Ouriel, Asteraoth, [name unknown]), seals them with the ring, and commands them to dig the Temple foundation (ch. 8). Solomon interrogates the headless demon called Murder, who sees through his breasts, attacks the voices of infants, cuts off heads, attaches them to himself and consumes them through his neck, inflames limbs, inflicts feet, and produces festering sores; he is ordered to stay with Beelzeboul (ch. 9). Solomon interrogates the doglike demon, Scepter, who deceives those who follow his star and subdues the hearts of men through their throats; Scepter then helps Solomon to obtain an emerald stone for the Temple; Solomon learns that the demon is"},{"pageNumber":989,"pageContent":"thwarted by the great Briathos (ch. 10). Solomon interrogates the Lion-Shaped Demon, who prolongs illness and rules a legion of demons; they are thwarted by Emmanouel, who will drive them over the cliff into the water; the legion is commanded to carry wood and the Lion-Shaped One is made to saw it with his claws and to fuel the perpetually burning kiln (ch. 11). Solomon interrogates the three-headed dragon spirit, Head of the Dragons, and learns that he blinds fetuses and makes them deaf and dumb, and causes men to fall down and grind their teeth; he is thwarted by the place marked \"Place of the Skull\" and the angel of the Wonderful Counselor on the cross; after revealing a treasure of gold in the Temple, he is sealed and ordered to make bricks for the Temple (ch. 12). Solomon interrogates Obyzouth, the female demon with disheveled hair, who strangles newborn infants at birth, injures eyes, condemns mouths, destroys minds, and creates pain; learning that she is thwarted by the angel Raphael, or writing her name on a piece of papyrus when women give birth, Solomon binds her by the hair and hangs her in front of the Temple (ch. 13). Solomon interrogates the Winged Dragon, who copulates through the buttocks of women who have beautiful bodies and who suddenly sets on fire with his breath wood for constructing the Temple. Learning that the demon is thwarted by Bazazath, Solomon invokes the angel and condemns the demon to cut marble for constructing the Temple (ch. 14). Solomon interrogates Enepsigos, the female demon with two heads, learns that she hovers near the moon, can also take the form of Kronos or another form, and that she is thwarted by the angel Rathanael; Solomon prays to God, invokes Rathanael, seals Enepsigos with a triple-link chain, and after she prophesies the destruction of kingdom, Temple, and Jerusalem, the scattering of the demons, and the coming of the Son of God, Emmanouel, who is crucified on a cross and born of a virgin, Solomon explains that he wrote the testament so that the sons of Israel might know the powers and forms of the demons and their thwarting angels (ch. 15). Solomon interrogates Kunopegos, the cruel sea-horse demon who becomes a great wave that causes ships to capsize, drowns men, and causes seasickness; learning that he is thwarted by the angel Iameth, Kunopegos is sealed in a bowl and stored away in the Temple (ch. 16). Solomon interrogates a lecherous spirit born from a giant in the age of giants, a spirit who has the shadowy form of a man and gleaming eyes; at midnight in the tombs the demon slays men with a sword or possesses a man, causing him to gnaw his own flesh; learning that the demon will be thwarted by the Savior or his mark written on the forehead (the sign of the cross), Solomon locks up the demon (ch. 17). Solomon interrogates the thirty-six heavenly bodies who are divisions (decans) of the Zodiac; he learns their names, the mental, physical, and social illnesses they cause, their thwarting angels, and orders them to bear water and to go to the Temple (ch. 18). Riches are given to Solomon by all the kings of the earth, including Sheeba, the Queen of the South, who is a witch (ch. 19). Solomon hears the conflict between an old man and his son; Omias the demon prophesies that the son will die and Solomon compels him to explain how he knows God's plan for the future; Ornias tells that demons in the heavens overhear God's decisions and that falling stars are really demons who are exhausted because they have no way stations on which to rest; Ornias's prophecy is fulfilled (ch. 20). Sheeba, impressed with the new Temple, contributes ten thousand shekels (ch. 21). A letter from Adarkes, king of Arabia, requests Solomon's help against the wind demon Ephippas, which kills man and beast; when the gigantic cornerstone of the Temple cannot be moved by the artisans or demons, Solomon dispatches his servant boy to Arabia, where the boy entraps the wind demon in a leather flask by the aid of the ring; the boy brings the demon to the Temple, where he is interrogated by Solomon, who learns that his thwarting angel is the one who will be born of a virgin and crucified by the Jews (ch. 22). Solomon learns that the wind demon has great powers and requests that he put the cornerstone in place; the demon agrees and states that, with the aid of the demon who lives in the Red Sea, he will lift up the pillar of air which is in the Red Sea and place it where Solomon wishes; the cornerstone is inserted in place by the wind demon, fulfilling the keystone prophecy (Ps 118:22; ch. 23). The Arabian demon Ephippas and the demon of the Red Sea bring back the pillar from the Red Sea and continue to hold it in the air to this very day (ch. 24). Solomon interrogates the demon from the Red Sea, learns that his name is Abezethibou, that he was the one whom Iannes and Iambres called to their aid against Moses in Egypt, that he hardened Pharaoh's heart and caused the pursuit of the sons of Israel to the Red Sea,"},{"pageNumber":990,"pageContent":"where, with the company of the Egyptians, he was trapped when the waters receded; Solomon adjures him to continue holding up the pillar (ch. 25). Solomon falls madly in love with a beautiful Shummanite woman; to have her, he sacrifices five locusts to the foreign gods Raphan and Moloch, and takes her to his palace; the glory of God departs from Solomon after he builds temples to her idols; to those who hear he writes his testament (ch. 26). Texts The standard edition of the Greek text of the Testament of Solomon, introduced and edited by C. C. McCown, comments on fourteen Greek manuscripts.1 Another Greek manuscript2 and a fragment3 are known. A description of seven manuscripts in order of importance, according to McCown, is as follows:4 1. D: Dionysius monastery, Mount Athos, No. 132, folios 367 (recto)-374 (verso), sixteenth century, entitled peri tou Solomontos (\"About Solomon\"). The text of this manuscript was published in V. M. Istrin's Grieceski spiski zabesania Solomona (\"Greek Manuscripts of the Testament of Solomon\") (Odessa, 1898) and in Lietopis istoriko-phil-ologetscheskago Obtchestva VII (Byzantine Division IV; Odessa, 1899; pp. 49-98; contains also MSS I and Q). McCown collated the manuscript from photographs from which the title is missing; the pages are deleted by transverse lines; it is carefully written and well preserved. The manuscript is not really the testament, but a biography of Solomon characterized by a strong demonological interest. McCown believed that it was a revision of the story (d) which lay behind the testament and printed it separately.5 It includes David's sin with Bathsheba (1:1-3); God's inability to stop David (1:4-6); Nathan's reproof of David (1:7-l 1); Solomon's birth, reign, power, and wisdom (l:12f.); the building of the Temple (2:1); Solomon's favorite servant (2:2); Solomon's prayer about the matter (2:3); Solomon's interrogation of the servant (2:3f.); Solomon's supplication for him (2:5); the granting of the magic ring (2:6f.); Solomon's gift of the ring to the servant (2:8f.); the capture of Ornias the demon (2:10-13); Solomon's interrogation of Ornias (3:1-4); treatment of the demons (3:5-9); dispute of father and son and Ornias's prophecy (4:1-18); the admiration of the Temple by the \"Queen of the South\" and others (5:1); the king of Arabia's letter to Solomon (6: If.); 1 C. C. McCown, ed., The Testament of Solomon, pp. 10-28 of the Introduction (p. numbers of the Introduction have no asterisk; those of the Gk. text and apparatus do), describes eleven texts in the order of their importance to him (MSS D, H, I, L, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W) and lists a twelfth from Mt. Athos (No. 3221), which he was not able to obtain and which apparently has never been studied. To these twelve MSS should be added two others which McCown discovered too late to be evaluated in their proper order. The first (MS N) is described and its variants listed separately as an appendix to the Introduction, pp. 112-23; it is included in the list of most important MSS here (see n. 9). The other (MS E) is described by McCown separately (pp. 123-26), but because it is not the full testament, it is printed separately (pp. 102-20*; the same is the case for MS D, pp. 88-97*). Apart from MSS D, E, and N, the MSS are collated and printed as an eclectic text with three recs.: A (MSS H I L), B (MSS P Q), and C (MSS S T U V W). Furthermore' parts of rec. C (TSol 1:1-5; 9:8-13:15) have such unique material that they are also printed separately (pp. 76-87*). All three recs. are distinguished in the opening VSS. where McCown favors rec. B over what he considered the best rec. overall, rec. A.

Delatte, Anecdota Atheniensia 36 (1927) 211-27. This is an 18th-cent. MS, 17.4 x 11.5 CCS. It is not the full testament but a shortened form like MSS D and E. Briefly, its contents include a narrative of David's sin, Nathan's rebuke, and the birth and glories of Solomon; Solomon's favorite boy and the story of the boy; the gift of the ring through Michael; the capture of Ornias by the boy with the ring; Solomon's interrogation of Ornias; fetching of Beelzeboul by the boy and Ornias; interrogation of Beelzeboul, thwarted by Raphael; the story of the old man and his son interspersed with material about Ornias and Michael; Sheeba (Sibulla); the letter of the king of Arabia; fetching of Ephippas by the boy; interrogation of Ephippas; the cornerstone account; a parenthetical remark about Jesus; bringing of the pillar by the boy with the seal and Ephippas; Solomon's learning about the chief Satan, Chathrou Samael; the fetching of the demon and his corps by the boy and Ornias; observation of the demons at work on the Temple; interrogation of Chathrou Samael, thwarted by the Savior of the world, the Son and Word of God; rebuke of Samael, who is commanded to work on the Temple; account of the kings of the earth who are impressed by the Temple and Solomon's power; glories of the Temple; parenthetical remark about John of Damascus and the Church; parenthetical remark about Christ, the disciples, and the Temple; Jeremiah and the Temple; the destruction of the Temple by the Chaldeans; Christian conclusion and note about the boy, whose name is Chiram. 3 K.

H: private library of the Earl of Leicester, Holkham Hall, Norfolk, England, No. 99. This sixty-eight-page manuscript from the fifteenth century, perhaps from Greece, measuring 16 x 21.5 centimeters per folio page, is entitled diegesis peri tes diathekes Solomdntos . . . (\"An Account Concerning the Testament of Solomon . . .\"). It is clear, has many abbreviations, and places rubrics before the chief divisions of the story. Its title and the initial letters of lesser sections are in red. It omits 14:3-16:1 (cf. MS L). Except for 26:8-10, its text is usually abbreviated. 3. I: Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris, Supplement grec, No. 500. This manuscript is from the sixteenth century and measures 16 x 22 centimeters. The testament is found on folios 78-82. Its title begins Solomdntos . . . ([\"concerning] Solomon\"), with diatheke t (\"Tes­tament o[f]\") carelessly written in the upper margin (see TSol 1:00, n. c). The manuscript is well preserved. It was published by Istrin (see MS D, above). The Testament of Solomon follows Ecclesiastes and Song of Songs in the codex. The copyist seems to have wearied of the many demons, for he broke off in the middle of a sentence in the middle of a column at 5:8. 4. L: Harleian MSS, British Museum, No. 5596. This fifteenth-century manuscript measures 23 x 34 centimeters and has a catalog description \"Geomantica, exorcismi, divinationes et huius modi\" (\"Geomantics, exorcisms, divinations and things of this sort\") with the addition \"quaedam Salominis\" (\"certain things of Solomon\"). It is well preserved. Folios 8 (recto) to 18 (recto) of manuscript 5596 contain the incomplete testament, omitting 14:3-16:1 (cf. MS H) and ending at 18:41. Other portions of the manuscript make up \"MS T\"7 because they represent for McCown recension C rather than A in which manuscript H falls. The testament has been worked over by a medieval magician who included magical, astrological, and demonological lore. The largest section of the manuscript is the Clavicula Salomonis, probably the best-known medieval Solomonic document.8 Titles to sections in the Clavicula, a large circular seal containing magical signs, and the numbers of \"MS Td\" are painted with silver over red. Places that direct one to a magical remedy for disease are marked with a cross and a circle. 5. N: Library of the Greek Patriarchate, Jerusalem, Sancti Saba, No. 422. This is a fifteenth- or sixteenth-century manuscript measuring 11 x 15 centimeters. The beginning and end of the codex are missing. The testament begins on folio 49 and ends on folio 93, though its first page is missing, causing it to go unnoticed until McCown rediscovered it in 1920-21. Too late to be collated with the others, McCown described it and printed its variant readings separately as an appendix, pp. 112-23.9 The manuscript often makes no sense, but it is virtually complete and McCown judged it closer to the original form of the testament than manuscript P (rec. B), to which it is most similar. It is the only other manuscript besides manuscript P to contain Testament of Solomon 14:3-16:1, the latter part of which incorporates the testament's most Christian comment (TSol 15:10-12) and a separate explanation as to why the testament was written (TSol 15:13-15; cf. 26:7f.). Yet, near the end of the testament, manuscript N supports manuscript H (rec. A) enough that McCown, who had come to have more confidence in recension B and to print it at that point, was willing to revise his judgment back in favor of recension A (cf. TSol 26:8, n. f). Finally, it should be noted that manuscript N equates each of the thirty-six decans in chapter 18 with ten days of the Coptic month. This equation relates manuscript N to Egypt. 6 McCown, Testament, pp. 88-97.* The two other shorter versions of the testament are MS E, which McCown discovered too late to collate with MS D (McCown, Testament, pp. 123-26; 102-20*), and Delatte's Bibliotheque Nationale No. 2011 (summarized in n. 2 above). 7 Three fragments from this MS are designated by McCown as T°, V, and Td since they are separate fragments and belong to his rec. C. They make up his eighth \"MS.\" 8 See below, \"Cultural importance.\" 9 MS N is not included among McCown's eleven MSS in this order (see n. 1), but he writes that \"It is certainly much nearer the original than P . . .\"in most instances (McCown, Testament, p. 113). Therefore, I have placed MS N before MSS P and Q."},{"pageNumber":992,"pageContent":"6. P: Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris, Anciens fonds grecs, No. 38 (Colbert 4895). This sixteenth-century manuscript has twenty-four folios and measures 15.5 x 20.5 centimeters. Its title begins diatheke Solomontos (for the full title, see TSol 1:00). The manuscript, which belonged to the library of M. le President de Mesmes (died 1596), is carefully written and worked over by an editor. It is cataloged as \"no. 38 olim Colbert.'' Though known and occasionally cited by scholars in the seventeenth century, it was first printed by F. F. Fleck in Wissenschaftliche Reise durch das siidliche Deutschland, Italien, Sicilien und Frankreich 2/3, Anecdota maximam partem sacra (Leipzig, 1837, pp. 113-40). This text of the testament became the standard work until Istrin (see above, MS D); but Istrin's work was in Russian and not easily accessible in the West. The Fleck text of manuscript P was reprinted by J. Furst, Der Orient 5 (1844) and 7 (1846), with a German translation, and in Literaturhlatt editions; but it was incomplete. It was also reprinted in the standard collection of early Christian writings in Greek (cf. J. P. Migne, Patrologia graeca, vol. 122 [Paris, 1864], cols. 1315-58). McCown wrote that \"Fleck rather inaccurately copied the editio princeps from MS P, mistaking many letters, and so causing himself and those who have had to depend upon his edition much difficulty.\"10 Yet, the only English translation to date is based on the Fleck edition (cf. F. C. Conybeare, JQR 11 [1898] 1-45). To facilitate comparison with Conybeare's translation of Fleck, the present translation attempts to follow, where possible, Conybeare's paragraph divisions and places his paragraph division numbers in parentheses in the margin. There is also an English paraphrase of the testament in L. Ginzberg's The Legends of the Jews (trans. H. Szold; 7 vols. [Philadelphia, 1913] vol. 4, pp. 150-54). F. A. Bornemann (Zeitschrift fiir die historische Theologie 14 [1844] 9-56) translated Fleck's edition into German. 7. Q: Andreas Convent, Mount Athos, No. 73. This represents folios 11-15 of the materials published by Istrin (see above, MS D), who bracketed many letters and omitted sections, indicating to McCown many lacunae. Testament of Solomon 3:1-20:9 is missing. It is important to understand why these manuscripts are given in this particular order.11 The first manuscript, D, is not the testament but, according to McCown, a revision of the story (d) which lay behind the testament. For that reason, it is not translated below; rather, the base text is McCown's eclectic text, which is an attempt to reconstruct the Testament of Solomon which lay behind recensions A (MSS HIL) and B (MSS PQ, to which note must be taken of N). Hence, manuscripts HIL, or recension A, come next, followed by NPQ, or recension B. McCown described five other manuscripts or parts thereof (MSS STUVW) which he called recension C. Mount Athos 3221 (not obtained) and manuscript E (McCown, pp. 123-26; 102-20*) account for the other two manuscripts. Original language In 1896, Moses Gaster, on the basis of what he considered to be a misunderstanding of a Hebrew term, argued that the testament (the Fleck edition of MS P) was a translation from the Hebrew.12 McCown, skeptical of an argument based on a single instance from what he, in his day, knew to be a single manuscript among several, turned up two more possibilities,13 one in an important passage of Egyptian origin.14 However, though it is possible that the testament has Semitic language materials behind it, or its sources, these meager instances cannot support the hypothesis that it is a translation document. McCown's conclusion still stands: the native language of the writer of the Testament of Solomon as a testament was Koine Greek, the commonly spoken Greek of the hellenistic era, and thus of the New Testament.15 It is no surprise that in most respects the language and style of the testament are similar to that of the Greek New Testament.16 10 McCown, Testament, p. 28. 11 See n. 1, and TSol, Title, n. a. 12 See M.

NT will find many terms of the NT on every page."},{"pageNumber":993,"pageContent":"Date The story of the Testament of Solomon purports to take place during the reign of Solomon in the tenth century B.C. Nonetheless, there is no doubt that it comes from much later times, not only because of its language, but because it presupposes events, some in the form of prophecies, which took place in the first century A.D., and because in general it assumes thought forms generally accepted as having arisen in hellenistic times.17 Nonetheless, because explicit references to historical events, apart from the story line and prophecy, are lacking, opinions about its date have varied. In the preface to the testament in Migne's patrology (1864), F. F. Fleck argued that the writing (again, MS P) was a Byzantine work from the Middle Ages;18 the Russian Istrin, who discovered manuscript D and first argued in 1898 that it was the basis for the testament, thought that the latter was written about A.D. 1200.19 In 1844, the German F. A. Bornemann moved the date back to the early fourth century, because he believed that its demonology resembled Lactantius' \"mstitutiones,\"20 and in 1907 this view was echoed by C. H. Toy in the Jewish Encyclopedia.21 Meanwhile, A. Harnack, though he would not fix a date, thought it might not be in the earliest period,22 while E. Schurer left the date open.23 In 1898, F. C. Conybeare, in the preface to his English translation of the testament (MS P), noted that it was quoted as one of Solomon's authentic writings in the Greek Dialogue of Timothy and Aquila. The Dialogue, a Christian document from about A.D. 400, was thought by Conybeare to go back to an earlier dialogue from the middle of the second century.24 During the course of the Dialogue, the Christian applies Psalm 2:7 (\"You are my son, today I have become your father\") to Jesus as Messiah. The Jew, however, says the passage refers to Solomon and adds 2 Samuel 7:14 (\"I will be a father to him and he a son to me\") as further proof. The Christian responds, with reference to 1 Kings 11:3-6, that the promise to David's son was conditional on Solomon's walking in the Lord's ways as David did; but Solomon did not keep God's commandments. He sacrificed locusts to idols. The dialogue continues: The Jew responded, \"Not sacrificed [esphaxen, \"split the throat\"], but unwillingly crushed [ethlasen] in his hand. The Book of Kings does not encompass these things, but it is written in his Testament.\" The Christian said, \"On this I take my stand with confidence, because this was not made clear by the hand of a historian, but out of the mouth of Solomon himself.'925 This reference unambiguously refers to the Testament of Solomon (cf. TSol 26:5). Conybeare went on to propose that the testament was a Christian revision of a Jewish document, the original form of which might well have been \"the very collection of incantations which, according to Josephus, was composed and bequeathed by Solomon,\"26 that is, in one form it goes back at least to the late first century A.D. Conybeare also suggested that certain Christian additions to this originally Jewish document sounded very \"archaic\" and \"seem to belong to about 100 A.D.,\"27 that the section about the thirty-six heavenly bodies (TSol 18) shared a common demonology with the apostle Paul, and that its faith had an analogue in that of the Essenes, a Jewish sect described by Josephus (Wars 2.142).28 K.

Salzberger in his extensive study of the whole Solomon legend in Semitic literature.30 In his ground-breaking critical edition of the testament (1922), McCown suggested that the latest possible date, on the basis of the Dialogue of Timothy andAquila, was about A.D. 400. In some respects, he agreed with Conybeare, for he stated that if one removed the Christian and pagan elements, \"the Test comes to be of assistance in reconstructing the thought world of the Palestinian Jew in the first century of our era . . .\"31 He even pointed to a number of ideas which he thought represented first-century Judaism.32 Yet, in contrast to Conybeare, McCown stressed the view that the testament as a testament was a Christian work (i.e. not simply a Jewish work edited by a Christian) from the early third century A.D. Building on Istrin's hypothesis that manuscript D was closer to the original form of the document which later became the testament, McCown suggested that originally there existed a collection of first-century Jewish Midrashim, or interpretative stories, about Solomon and the demons. These came from Palestine, perhaps Galilee.33 They formed a more connected story (the hypothetical d), a revision of which is preserved in manuscript D, which was transcribed by an educated Greek from Byzantine times.34 From dy an early third-century Christian—his demonology is like that found in Origen's Against Celsus—removed the episodes about David's sin and Nathan's inability to warn David on account of the devil; he added demonologic, astrological, and magical material, concluding with Solomon's demise. This work our Christian author called a \"testament\"35; it is best represented by recension A (MSS HIL). Then, another Christian from the fourth or fifth century added especially demonologic, but also gnostic, cabalistic, and Christian elements;36 these can be seen in recension B (MSS PQ, along with N, collated separately).37 Recension B, which is better at the beginning and end of the testament, is to be compared with recension A to arrive at the autograph.38 Finally, a Christian of the Middle Ages, perhaps in the twelfth or thirteenth century, added magical formulas, gnostic-sounding terms, and a number of medieval ideas to make recension C.39 To McCown, it was inconceivable that any one should take the Test as found in Recs. A, B, or C, and, by eliminating all the magico-medical element and the \"testament\" motif, reduce it to the simple tale of Solomon's birth and greatness, his temple building with demons, which appears in MS D.40 In 1922, M. R. James found McCown's theory of the evolution of the testament \"plausible, but not wholly convincing,\"41 and raised the question whether such a reduction to the simple tale might not have taken place, just as the author of the \"Greek Legend of Isaiah\" pruned the Ascension of Isaiah; nonetheless, James went on to accept McCown's early third-century dating of the testament itself, as have most other scholars since McCown, notably A.-M. Denis.42 An exception to this trend, however, is the recognized authority on the magical papyri, K. Preisendanz, who suggested that the original was from the first or second century 29 K. Kohler, \"Demonology,\" The Jewish Encyclopedia, vol. 4, p. 578. 30 G. Salzberger, Die Salomosage in der semitischen Literatur (Berlin, 1907) p. 10. 31 McCown, Testament, p. 3. 32 Ibid., pp. 59-62. 33 Ibid., pp. 85, 108. 34 Ibid., pp. 35, 86. The contents of d, he suggested, consisted of that which is common to MS D and the testament, e.g. essentially TSol 1-2, 20, 22-24. 35 TSol 15:13-15 from a redactional critical perspective sounds like an ending; McCown, Testament, p. 83, suggests that it is \"probably the work of the B redacteur,\" noting that the term \"testament\" occurs in TSol 15:14 and in 26:8, the latter reference being also probably a Christian addition. 36 McCown, Testament, p. 89, argued that there was too much Christian material in the testament to be Jewish and that Josephus the Jew would not have referred to a Christian document. The argument is, of course, circular. 37 Ibid., pp. 35, 82f. 38 McCown modified his distrust of rec. A at the end of TSol in the light of his discovery of MS N; see above, \"Texts\" (N) and note 1; Textual Emendations; TSol 26:8, n. f. 39 McCown, Testament, pp. 83f., 100, 108. 40 Ibid., p. 32. 41 M.

Before concluding a discussion of the testament's date, one unexpected and interesting datum should be mentioned. In 1945, Coptic translations of fifty-one tractates, mostly gnostic, were discovered in southern Egypt in the vicinity of Nag Hammadi. Four of the tractates mention Solomon,44 and one of them, \"On the Origin of the World,\" mentions \"the Book of Solomon.\" The context of this reference deals with \"Death,\" begotten by the First Father of Chaos, Ialdabaoth, and set up over the sixth heaven. The passage continues: Then since Death was androgynous, he mixed with his nature and begot seven androgynous sons. These are the names of the males: Jealousy, Wrath, Weeping, Sighing, Mourning, Lamenting, Tearful Groaning. And these are the names of the females: Wrath, Grief, Lust, Sighing, Cursing, Bitterness, Quarrelsomeness. They had intercourse with one another, and each one begot seven so that they total forty-nine androgynous demons. Their names and their functions you will find in \"the Book of Solomon.\"45 The identification of \"the Book of Solomon\" which gives the names and functions of the forty-nine demons has given rise to several hypotheses. J. Doresse originally offered two suggestions. The reference might have been to the \"Epistle to Rehoboam,\" also called the \"Hygromancie of Solomon\" or \"The Key to Hydromancy,\" perhaps composed in first-century B.C. Egypt.46 This Solomonic book contains lists of the seven planets, of angels, and of demons which influence each of the twenty-four hours of each day of the week, followed by prayers to the planets and the angels, magical signs of each planet, and the plants of the zodiacal signs and planets. Doresse, however, thought it might be more likely that the reference was \"to something in that vast collection entitled the Testament of Solomon, which enumerates a crowd of genies and mentions, for example, as rulers of this terrestrial world, Deception, Discord, Quarrelsomeness, Violent Agitation, Error, Violence, and Per­versity.\"47 Doresse appears to refer here to the seven \"world rulers\" (stoicheia) of the Testament of Solomon, chapter 8. Doresse's specific reference to the testament, chapter 8, has the complication that, if Giversen's retranslation of the male and female demons of the passage from Coptic into Greek is correct,48 the only common name with the Testament, chapter 8, is Eris, \"Strife,\" \"Discord.\" Yet, the reference is to the forty-nine demons; though the testament does not have exactly forty-nine, it does have more than forty-nine, 43 Preisendanz, \"Salomo,\" (Pauly-Wissowa Supplement 8 [1956] col. 689, and EOS 48 [1956] 161-62) draws upon the classic study of W. Gundel, Dekane und Dekansternbilder, Studien der Bibliothek Warburg 19 (Hamburg, 1936), who discusses TSol at length (pp. 49-62), and suggests that ch. 18 was in use in pre-Christian Egypt. In his latter article (EOS 48 [1956] 161) Preisendanz states that the formulation of the Gk. text of the testament itself appears to go back to the 1st or 2nd cent. A.D. However, he uses as one of his arguments a reference to McCown, Testament, p. 40, where McCown does not date the testament itself. For McCown, presumably only the hypothetical d might have been that early. See esp.

Author and provenance There is nothing in the Testament of Solomon which would clearly identify its author. As the above discussion indicates, the author did not write in either Hebrew or Aramaic. If a Greek-speaking Jew originally wrote it, it was edited by a Christian; more recent scholarship, however, accepts the view that the author was a Greek-speaking Christian. This is reinforced by what appear to be the final stages of redaction (cf. TSol 11:6; 12:3; 15:10-15). Equally difficult to establish is its provenance, for, like most hellenistic (-Jewish) magic, the testament has an international quality. Certain elements suggest Babylonia. The ascription of ailments and diseases to specific demons was deeply rooted there, and so was the wind demon, which causes a fever (TSol 22).51 There are also connections with the Babylonian Talmud, for example, the demons assisting Solomon's temple building, or the lengthy treatment of the legend of Ashmedai ( = Asmodeus).52 Furthermore, the popular magic of the Aramaic Incantation Bowls from Babylonia, though from about A.D. 600, is in many respects like the magic of the testament, most notably in the importance of Solomon as a \"Son of David\" whose name is invoked to exorcise the demons.53 Yet, some judge that the testament is both pre-talmudic in its demonology and earlier than the type of magic associated with the sixth-century bowls; thus, Babylonia is not usually suggested as the place of origin.54 A second possibility is Asia Minor. The Book of Acts stresses that Ephesus was an important center for the magical arts; whether accurate or not, the claim is made that magical books worth 50,000 pieces of silver were consumed in a book burning at Ephesus (Acts 19:11-20). Though somewhat meager, there are other indications of active magical activity in Asia Minor; for example, a whole magical apparatus has been discovered at Pergamum.55 Among the scholars, McCown; followed by James, mildly and cautiously favored Ephesus or some part of Asia Minor, McCown because \"no decisive objections appear.\"56 The third, and perhaps most obvious possibility, is Egypt, that melting pot of ancient magical lore. Ethiopia received its Jewish and Christian traditions via Egypt, and Ethiopia preserved magic, demonology, and legends about the Queen of Sheeba and Solomon's demise similar to those found in the testament.57 The magic of the testament is very much 49 For example, Error and Power (cf. TSol 8:5); one also finds in the Nag Hammadi texts Orneos, Michael, Gabriel, cherubim and seraphim, and various forms of Uriel (Ouriel). For an account of the fallen angels (cf. TSol 5:3; 6:2), see On the Origin of the World (II, 5:123).

Presumably the papyrus fragments of the decan chapter of the testament came from Egypt.58 Gnostic amulets frequently drew on the name of Solomon, and gnostic texts from Nag Hammadi refer to a \"Book of Solomon\" and the tradition of Solomon and the demons.59 Finally, the earliest literary reference to the testament is likely from Egypt (Dialogue of Timothy and Aquila).60 Conybeare thought that the testament was probably a favorite book among the Egyptian Ophians or some analogous gnostic sect, but McCown objected to Conybeare's gnostic interpretation of the Testament of Solomon, chapter 8, and believed that neither the testament's cosmology nor its dualism was gnostic enough to derive it from Egyptian gnosticism.61 A final possibility is Syria-Palestine. The Jews and Samaritans were known in the Greco-Roman world for magic, and the Solomonic magical tradition is well documented in Palestinian Judaism, as will be presently shown.62 If Conybeare's suggestion that Josephus was referring to the testament seems a bit farfetched, it is also clear that McCown's primary reason for preferring Asia Minor over Palestine (Galilee)—the testament is \"thoroughly Greek in its language and much of its material\"63—would no longer be accepted by an increasing number of scholars who are convinced of the hellenization of Palestine.64 Thus, the fourth possibility, Syria-Palestine, emerges as more of a live option than could have been possible in McCown's day. In short, McCown's judgment that it is impossible to reach any certain conclusion about the testament's place of origin must be reaffirmed; but his view of the ascending order of probability—Galilee, Egypt, Asia Minor65—might just as likely be stated as Babylonia, Asia Minor, Egypt, Palestine. Historical importance The Testament of Solomon is the product of the growth of a legend about a famous biblical character combined with a variety of syncretistic beliefs about astrology, demonology, angelology, magic, and medicine. As the product of long tradition, it represents not only its own period of composition but the period of the Second Jewish Commonwealth and the rise of earliest Christianity. The testament is an important response to basic human problems: the presence of human frailty, sickness, and potential death. It therefore invites comparison with similar responses from the arena of ancient eastern Mediterranean civilizations, especially Persian, Babylonian, Egyptian, Greek, Jewish, Christian, and Islamic religions.

It can also be seen in the context of the history of magic, medicine, and science.66 One of the historically important features of the testament is that it represents a popular hellenistic Jewish-Christian view of King Solomon, one of the key figures of the Jewish Scriptures, midway between the time he actually lived (10th cent. B.C.) and the period when many of the surviving texts about him stressed his character as the magician par excellence (15th-16th cent. A.D.). The view that Solomon was a magician goes back to ancient interpretations of 1 Kings 4:29-34 (5:9-14 in Heb.):67 Yahweh gave Solomon immense wisdom and understanding, and a heart as vast as the sand on the seashore. The wisdom of Solomon surpassed the wisdom of all the sons of the East, and all the wisdom of Egypt. He was wiser than any other, wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, wiser than Heman and Calcol and Darda, the cantors. He composed three thousand proverbs; and his songs numbered a thousand and five. He could talk about plants from the cedar in Lebanon to the hyssop growing on the wall; and he could talk of animals, and birds and reptiles and fish. Men from all nations came to hear Solomon's wisdom, and he received gifts from all the kings of the world, who heard of his wisdom. This Old Testament tradition is expanded in the following way: Solomon's wisdom is increasingly seen to include magical knowledge, and his literary productivity grows to include magical incantations and magical books. The literary side to his productivity can already be observed in the Old Testament itself, for it is claimed that he authored Proverbs (Prov 1:1), Song of Songs (Song 1:1; cf. 1:5; 3:7, 9, 11; 8:11), Ecclesiastes (Eccl 1:1, 12, 16-18), and, if extended to the apocrypha, it is implied that he authored the Wisdom of Solomon (WisSol 8:10f.; 9:7f., 12). Other pseudepigraphic books include the Odes of Solomon, the Psalms of Solomon, and the work under consideration, the Testament of Solomon. In the Wisdom of Solomon (WisSol 7:15-22), probably from second-century B.C. Egypt, it is claimed that Solomon knows astrology, \"powers of roots,\" and \"forces of spirits,\" in part an extension of his knowledge of plants in 1 Kings 5. Perhaps from about the same time and place came a Septuagint translator who changed 1,005 \"songs\" in 1 Kings 5:12 (4:32) to 5,000 \"odes\" (Gk. odai), and this may be the source of the later view that Solomon wrote \"incantations\" (Gk. epodai; cf. Josephus, Ant 8.2.5). In any case, it is clear that Solomon's fame grew in Egypt at a very early period. Meanwhile, though sometimes difficult to trace, the popular tradition was also growing in Palestine. Josephus wrote that the Essenes, usually thought to have written the Dead Sea Scrolls, did \"research into medicinal roots and properties of stones for the healing of diseases\" (War'2.8.6). It may be that Solomon was known among them as an exorcist of demons. Certainly, Abraham in the Genesis Apocryphon and probably Daniel in the Prayer of Nabonidus are viewed as types of exorcists. Recently, there has turned up a curious recension of Psalm 91, which was known among the Rabbis as an exorcistic psalm (y.Shab 6:8b: \"song for the stricken\"; b.Shebucoth 15b: \"song referring to evil demons\"; y.cErub 10:26c: \"song for the demons\"), which contains Solomon's name just before the term \"demons\" in column l.68 These Dead Sea Scrolls references are at least so early as the first century A.D. From the late first or early second century A.D., in all probability, comes Pseudo-Philo's Liber antiquitatum biblicarum 60, originally a separate literary piece written in Hebrew, and probably from Palestine. It contains a psalm said to have been played by David on his harp to rebuke the demon that troubled Saul. At the end of the psalm there is a prophecy that some commentators think might refer to Solomon. D. Harrington translates the prophecy 66 See L. Thorndike, A History of Magic and Experimental Science, 5 vols. (New York, 1923) especially vol. 1 and vol. 2. 67 For much of what follows, see D.

The document contains many Jewish, Iranian, and Mandaean ideas and many scholars believe it is non-Christian; in fact, A. Bohlig, G. MacRae, and C. Hedrick would locate it in a first- or second-century A.D. Syrian-Palestinian baptismal sect.70 It is interesting in this regard to note that the Mandaean Ginza views Solomon as the ruler over the demons and the seven planetary Devs.71 In any case the Apocalypse of Adam 7:1-48 lists thirteen false explanations for the origin of a redeemer figure called the Photor, or \"Illuminator.\" Hedrick has attempted to trace the redactional history of this section in Palestinian-Jewish baptismal sects prior to its incorporation into its present context sometime prior to A.D. 150.72 The fourth explanation for the origin of the Photor reads: The fourth kingdom says [of him]: \"He came [from a virgin . . . Solomon] sought her, he and Phersalo and Sauel and his armies which had been sent out. Solomon also sent his army of demons to seek the virgin. And they did not find the one they sought, but the virgin who was given to them was the one they fetched. Solomon took her. The virgin conceived and gave birth to the child there. She nourished him on a border of the desert. When he had been nourished, He received glory and power from the seed from which he had been begotten. And thus he came to the water.\"73 [ApAdam 7:13-16; Italics mine.] Though the tradition of the virgin who bore Solomon a child is new, it is clear that the text knows of the legend of Solomon's control of an army of demons so prominent in other Jewish sources, and specifically in the testament. In short, it is possible that the Apocalypse of Adam should be added to early Jewish Palestinian source material about Solomon. The tradition of Solomon as magician, which is only roughly represented in the above material, is clearly present in Josephus' Antiquities 8.2.5. This important passage reads: Now so great was the prudence and wisdom which God granted Solomon that he surpassed the ancients, and even the Egyptians, who are said to excel all men in understanding, were not only, when compared with him, a little inferior but proved to fall far short of the king in sagacity ... He also composed a thousand and five books of odes and songs, and three thousand books of parables and similitudes, for he spoke a parable about every kind of tree from the hyssop to the cedar, and in like 69 M.

Subsequently, it was adapted by an anti-water baptism community to illustrate thirteen false explanations of the Photor's origin. Finally, a redactor who combined a Jewish gnostic source (A) with a largely non-Jewish but certainly non-Christian gnostic source (B) incorporated the catalog into source (B). According to Hedrick, the document was \"redacted prior to A.D. 150 during an early stage of the Sethian-Archontic tradition by a representative of a minority faction who argued for a spiritualized understanding of baptism and an ascetic life style\" (pp. ii-iii).

There was no form of nature with which he was not acquainted or which he passed over without examining, but he studied them all philosophically and revealed the most complete knowledge of their several properties. And God granted him knowledge of the art used against demons for the benefit and healing of men. He also composed incantations by which illnesses are relieved, and left behind forms of exorcisms with which those possessed by demons drive them out, never to return. And this kind of cure is of very great power among us to this day, for I have seen a certain Eleazar, a countryman of mine, in the presence of Vespasian, his sons, tribunes and a number of other soldiers, free men possessed by demons, and this was the manner of the cure: he put to the nose of the possessed man a ring which had under its seal one of the roots prescribed by Solomon, and then, as the man smelled it, drew out the demon through his nostrils, and, when the man at once fell down, adjured the demon never to come back into him, speaking Solomon's name and reciting the incantations which he had composed. Then, wishing to convince the bystanders and prove to them that he had this power, Eleazar placed a cup or footbasin full of water a little way off and commanded the demon, as it went out of the man, to overturn it and make known to the spectators that he had left the man. And when this was done, the understanding and wisdom of Solomon were clearly revealed, on account of which we have been induced to speak of these things, in order that all men may know the greatness of his nature and how God favored him, and that no one under the sun may be ignorant of the king's surpassing virtue of every kind.74 In this passage, the allusions are clearly to 1 Kings 4:29-34 (5:9-14 in Heb.) again. The numbers 1,005 and 3,000 are those of the Hebrew text (not the Septuagint), but now Josephus refers to 1,005 books of odes (odai) and songs and 3,000 books of parables and similitudes, including those about all kinds of trees and creatures (the natural sources for magical incantations). Solomon is thus said to have composed \"incantations\" (epodai, perhaps suggested by odai) and exorcistic formulas by which one can drive out the demons. In addition, the ring is introduced, though it is really the root under the seal of the ring by which Eleazar performs the exorcism. Finally, Solomon's wisdom and greatness are so acknowledged that speaking his name and reciting his incantations help bring about the exorcism. All of this is an \"art\" (techne) employed by the ancient physician or magician. Because of its military setting Preisendanz connected this event with Vespasian's campaign in Palestine during the Jewish wars with Rome (A.D. 66-70), and Conybeare suggested (rather implausibly) that the testament might be the very book of incantations about which Josephus wrote.75 The interpretation of 1 Kings 5:13 (4:33) occurs again in the Targum Sheni to Esther. Solomon ruled over the wild beasts, over the birds of the heaven, and over the creeping beasts of the earth, as well as over the devils, the spirits of the night; and he understood the language of all these according as it is written, \"and he talked with the trees.\"76 [Italics mine.] In this targum, Solomon's mastery over the demons includes the \"demons of the night\" (Heb. lilin; cf. Isa 34:14, \"night hag\"). The reference to the \"demons of the night\" recalls the Aramaic Incantation Bowls, another example of Jewish magic.77 These bowls are about the size of soup tureens. They are reported to have been found upside down, usually in houses, often in the four corners of the houses, but also in cemeteries. There are several theories about bowl praxis, the most likely being that they were meant to trap or overturn the demons in some way.

(2) Sealed and countersealed and fortified are Ahat, the daughter of Imma; Rabbi, Malki and Dipshi, the sons of Ahat; and Yanai (3) the daughter of Ahat, and Ahat the daughter of Imma, and Atyona the son of Qarqoi, and Qarqoi the daughter of Shilta, and Shilta the daughter of Immi (4)—they and their houses and their children and their property are sealed with the seal-ring of El Shaddai, blessed be He, and with the seal ring of King (5) Solomon, the son of David, who worked spells on male demons and female liliths. Sealed, countersealed and fortified against the male demon (6) and female lilith and spell and curse and incantation and knocking and evil eye and evil black-arts, against the black-arts of mother (7) and daughter, and against those of daughter-in-law and mother-in-law, and against those of the presumptuous woman, who darkens the eyes and blows away the soul (i.e. causes despair), and against the evil black-arts, that are wrought by (8) men, and against everything bad.

Sealed are the bodies(?) of CS QL, the bodies(?) of CS QL MYLY MYLY TYGL'.78 [Italics mine.] The incantation bowls are relatively late and their demonology and magic are sometimes considered more developed than that in the testament; yet, there are similar incantations from an earlier period. An especially pertinent example is a Jewish incantation written in Hebrew on a small metal-foil amulet which was discovered in 1853 at the southern tip of the Sea of Galilee. Dated in the second or third century A.D., the thirty-two-line inscription is a piece of protective magic for an unborn infant, and it is very similar to an incantation on one of the bowls. It begins with the magician's magical equipment: \"And now with the wand of Moses and the shining-plate of Aaron the high priest, and with the seal of Solomon, and with [the Shield] of David, and with the mitre of the chief priest have I pro­nounced^) [the wo]rd . . ,\"79 [Italics mine.] Among the Rabbis, Solomon's wisdom was both exonerated as his greatest asset and deprecated as that which led to his downfall. The testament has obvious points in common with the rabbinic stories about Asmodeus (cf. Tob), who is called Ashmedai.80 When Solomon requires the stone-cutting worm, the shamir (\"flint,\" \"diamond\"), to cut stones for the Temple—according to law they could not be cut with iron tools (cf. IKgs 6:7)—it was surmised that the archdemon Ashmedai alone knew of its location. On earthly visits to watch debates in houses of learning, Ashmedai was known to get a drink at a mountain well which he then capped daily with a large rock and which he always examined before reopening. To obtain the coveted shamir, Solomon gave his chief man, Benaiah ben Jehoiadah, a chain engraved with the divine name, a ring engraved with the divine name, a bundle of wool, and a skin of wine, and dispatched him to the mountain well. Benaiah drilled a hole and drained off the water, and then, stuffing the hole with the bundle of wool, he filled the well with wine. When Ashmedai, descending from heaven, discovered the wine, he was suspicious; finally, however, he gave in to his thirst, became drowsy with the wine, and fell asleep. Benaiah then chained him about the neck, and when Ashmedai awoke and tried to get free, Benaiah stated that \"the name of thy Lord is upon thee\" (presumably, the demon was sealed 78 C. H. Gordon, \"Aramaic Magical Bowls in the Istanbul and Baghdad Museums,\" ArOr 6 (1934) 324-26 (Text B); Montgomery, Aramaic Incantation Texts, p. 170, contains an incantation in which the ring has on it \"the Ineffable Name\" (No. 11). 79 J.

After the completion of the Temple, the king told Ashmedai he did not understand how the demons' power could be so strong if their chieftain could be bound by a human. Ashmedai responded that if Solomon were to remove the chains and lend the magic ring to him, Ashmedai would prove his greatness. When Solomon agreed, Ashmedai hurled Solomon four hundred parasangs from Jerusalem, and then put himself forward as king. After much wandering, Solomon's lover, the Ammonite Naamah, recovered the magic ring from the belly of a fish, for Ashmedai had thrown it into the sea. Putting it on his finger, Solomon was immediately transported to Jerusalem, where he drove out Ashmedai and ascended the throne. There are other rabbinic stories that can be compared to stories in the testament. Of Solomonic magical books, however, there was scarcely mention until about the twelfth century when Solomon once again appeared as the source of all wisdom. It may be that the Rabbis were referring to this lack when they said that Hezekiah \"suppressed the book of recipes,\" for medieval commentators said that this book referred to a book which Solomon wrote.81 In any case, it appears that such books were ignored or, more likely, discouraged. In this connection it may be recalled that the Sepher Ha-Razim, a Jewish magical work pieced together by M. Margalioth and perhaps coming from third- or fourth-century Palestine, noted that Solomon was heir to the Books of the Mysteries, and that these gave him power over all the spirits and demons.82 The earliest Christian tradition about the magical wisdom of Solomon, suggest some modern interpreters, is already implied in the New Testament.83 They refer primarily to the cryptic passage which states \"something greater than Solomon is here\" (Matt 12:42), which is followed by the story of the return of the unclean spirit (Matt 12:43-45).84 One is also led to raise the possibility with the Son of David pericope (Mark 12:35-37 and parallels) and the Markan theology as a whole, e.g. as a conception Mark opposed.85 But if such connections are rejected, the first clear reference in the Christian literary tradition is found in Origen's commentary on Matthew 26:63 in which Origen states, \"It is customary to adjure demons with adjurations written by Solomon. But they themselves who use these adjurations sometimes use books not properly constituted; indeed they even adjure demons with some books taken from Hebrew.\"86 Possibly Origen was referring to the passage about Eleazar in Josephus, as do later Christian writers, but he might also have been thinking of the testament or the Sepher Ha-Razim. It has been noted above that the Nag Hammadi texts mention \"the Book of Solomon\" and contain what is probably a Jewish-gnostic baptismal text from Palestine which refers to Solomon and his army of demons. There are also two Christian gnostic texts from Nag Hammadi which mention Solomon. The first, The Second Treatise of the Great Seth, which is a polemic against \"orthodox\" Christianity, contains a \"laughingstock\" passage which polemicizes against a series of Old Testament figures. The litany-like pattern is that an Old Testament figure (Adam; Abraham, Isaac, Jacob; David; Solomon; the twelve prophets; or Moses) is called a \"laughingstock,\" followed by a reason related to the Hebdomad's (Jaldabaoth's) false claims about them to make himself stronger than the gnostics, concluded 81 j. Ber 10a; Pes 56a; cf. McCown, JPOS 2 (1922) 6f. The medieval commentators are Maimonides and Rashi. 82 M. Morgan, Sefer HaRazim, renders the Opening, 12f.: \"And when he [Noah] came forth from the ark, he used (the book [of mystery given to Noah by the angel Raziel]) all the days of his life, and at the time of his death he handed it down [two manuscripts: to Shem, and Shem] to Abraham, and Abraham to Isaac, and Isaac to Jacob, and Jacob to Levi, and Levi to Kohath, and Kohath to Amram, and Amram to Moses, and Moses to Joshua, and Joshua to the elders, and the elders to the prophets, and the prophets to the sages, and thus generation by generation until Solomon the king arose. And the Books of the Mysteries were disclosed to him and he became very learned in books of understanding and so ruled over everything he desired, over all the spirits and demons that wander in the world, and from the wisdom of this book he imprisoned and released, and sent and brought in, and built and prospered.\" Cf.

But we are innocent with respect to him.\"88 One wonders whether Solomon's \"strength\" in thinking he had become Christ was related to stories of his miracle working. Perhaps most interesting of the Nag Hammadi references to Solomon is that found in \"The Testimony of Truth\" (IX, 3), a Christian gnostic tractate which combines a homily with polemics against \"orthodox\" Christianity and other gnostic groups. A strongly ascetic (Encratite) document from perhaps the late second or late third century A.D., the tractate's Solomon section has a large lacuna which must be filled. Referring to hypocrites who say they renounce the world but do not, the passage continues as follows: They become wicked in their action, and some of them fall away [to the worship of] idols. [Others] have [demons] dwelling with them [as did] David the king. He is the one who laid the foundation of Jerusalem; and his son Solomon, whom he begat in [adultery], is the one who built Jerusalem by means of the demons, because he received [their powers]. When he [had finished building, he imprisoned] the demons [in the temple]. He [placed them] into seven [waterpots. They remained] a long [time in] the [waterpots], abandoned [there]. When the Romans [went] up to [Jerusalem] they discovered [the] waterpots, [and immediately] the [demons] ran out of the waterpots as those who escape from prison. And the waterpots [remained] pure (thereafter). [And] since those days [they dwell] with men who are [in] ignorance, and [they have remained upon] the earth. Who, then, is [David]? And who is Solomon? [And] what is the foundation? And what is the wall which surrounds Jerusalem? And who are the demons? And what are the waterpots? And who are the Romans? But these [are mysteries . . .]89 B. A. Pearson connects this passage with Jewish haggadic traditions, referring to a \"David-Solomon midrash,\" and thinks that the author \"is probably quoting or adapting from a written source [or sources] . . .\"90 S. Giversen also makes the link with Solomon's rule over the demons, especially as it is found in other Nag Hammadi texts.91 The connection with the testament is somewhat stronger if the lacuna at the end of the third sentence just quoted is restored to read \"he received [power]\" or \"he received [wisdom],\" thus reading, \"Solomon ... is the one who built Jerusalem by means of the demons, because he received power [or wisdom].\"92 In the testament the gifts of power and wisdom are from God; it is not the power of the demons (\"their power\"). Finally, there are instances in the testament when Solomon traps demons in vessels and places them in the Temple until they are freed, though the freeing occurs at the first destruction, not at the coming of \"the Romans,\"93 and the tradition of seven waterpots is known elsewhere.94 87 J.

That is what the language used to denote them makes one suppose; for the term 'bottles of Solomon' is a Hebraic expression . . . After these writings had spread everywhere, being still incomplete, they were corrupted. It is he (sc. Solomon) that invented them (sc. the talismanic bottles), as I said above. But Solomon only wrote a single work concerning the seven bottles; and people composed commentaries at different epochs to explain the things that this work contained. Now in these commentaries there was some fraud; (but) all (of them), or almost all, are in agreement on the work of the bottles directed against the demons.

The seven bottles in which Solomon shut up the demons were made of electrum. We must"},{"pageNumber":1004,"pageContent":"From the time of Origen on, Solomon is found in Christian tradition even more than in Jewish tradition. Many writers praise his magical powers, and he is found in the popular tradition on amulets, talismans, and lintels. When, however, the Jews attribute messianic passages to Solomon that Christians believe Jesus fulfills, the Christian writers become critical of Solomon.95 Solomon's fame as a magician in Judaism and Christianity carried over into the magic of the larger hellenistic world, and at least one example must be cited. This is a reference in the Paris Magical Papyrus, probably from the third or fourth century A.D. but containing traditional material of a much older date. The text reads, \"I adjure thee, every demonic spirit, say whatsoever thou art. For I adjure thee by the seal which Solomon laid upon the tongue of Jeremiah and he spoke.\"96 Though the passage occurs in a larger context which is probably a Jewish liturgical exorcism and undoubtedly refers to Jeremiah's inability to speak (Jer 1:6), the precise tradition which relates Jeremiah to Solomon's seal has not yet been traced. Nonetheless, it would be generally recognized that the passage illustrates an example of the use of Jewish, specifically Solomonic, magic in the magic of the Greco-Roman world. Islamic folklore developed the Solomonic tale in tremendously fertile and imaginative ways.97 Solomon is the greatest of the world rulers, a true apostle of Allah, his messenger, and a prototype of Muhammad. 1 Kings 4:33 (5:13 in Heb.) is recalled and so are rabbinic traditions such as the stone-cutting worm, the samur (shamir). Solomon's fantastic powers to trap the jinn are recounted, and his ring is said to be engraved with \"the most great name\" of God. Solomon's seal is a charm, usually in the form of a pentagram or hexagram. The major historical importance of the Testament of Solomon is that it provides a resource for understanding one type of common religious experience in hellenistic Jewish Christianity, an experience related to everyday problems of sickness and health, death and life. But it is also historically important as a means of seeing a high point in the development of the Solomonic legend. Filially, it is an important religious text to compare with other religious texts of the period. Theological importance The Testament of Solomon is a mixed collection of religious legends and beliefs, not a systematically constructed theology. Abstracted from such material is the following: GOD In the testament, God is the God of the Bible, but the accent falls heavily on his authority over the demons. He is the one and only God (TSol 26:3), the living God (TSol 1:13; 5:12), the \"Lord God of Israel\" (TSol 1:13) and the \"Holy One of Israel\" (TSol 4:12). His most frequent designation, \"the God of heaven and earth\" (TSol 1:8; 2:9; 3:6; 17:4; 18:41; 20:21), believe, in this respect, the Jewish writings concerning the demons. The altered book which we possess, and which is entitled The Seven Heavens, contains, in summary, the following: [?] The angel ordered Solomon to make these bottles. (The book) adds (that) Solomon made the seven bottles, according to the number of the seven planets, in conformity to the divine prescriptions . . . The wise Solomon knows also how to evoke the demons; he gives a formula of conjuration, and he indicates the electrum, that is, the bottles of electrum, on the surface of which he inscribed this formula.\" This text comes from a 15th cent. Syr. MS of some of Zosimus's alchemical writings published in French by M. P. E. Berthelot, Histoire des sciences: La Chimie au Moyen-dge (Paris, 1893) vol. 2, pp. 264-66, and translated by W. Scott and A. S. Ferguson, Hermetica IV: Testimonia (Oxford, 1936) pp. 140f. Zosimus may also know of a document in which a certain Mambres spoke to Solomon instructing him about sacrifices to drive off, or make powerless, the demons; see Scott-Ferguson, Hermetica IV, pp. Ill, 139f. if Reitzenstein (Poimandres, p. 214) is correct to suggest this is Jambres, \"the Egyptian sorcerer,\" this could be another point of contact with TSol (TSol 25:4; cf. 2Tim 3:8f.).

He is designated \"the great God Most High\" (TSol 11:6), indicating that his abode is in the heavens (cf. TSol 18:3); there he makes decisions about men (TSol 20:12). He is also called simply \"God\" (TSol 16:1; 25:9), the \"Lord God\" (TSol 1:7, 13; 5:12; 10:10), the \"Lord God Almighty\" (TSol 3:5), and the \"Lord Sabaoth\" (TSol l:6f.; 5:9), all designations of power and authority. His rule also extends to the underworld, for initially he has \"authority over all the spirits of the air, the earth, and (the regions) beneath the earth\" (TSol 18:3). Solomon prays to him as one of unquestioned authority (TSol 1:5, 8; 15:1; 18:41). This God, whose power can bind demons with unbreakable bonds (TSol 5:11), gives Solomon power over the demons (TSol 1:00; 18:3), grants him a ring for such power through his archangel Michael (TSol 1:6), and instructs him on how to respond to their evil plots (TSol 7:4). Solomon's power, therefore, always is recognized as a gift for which Solomon continually gives God praise, glory, and thanks (viz. TSol 1:5). When Solomon's lust drives him to idolatry, God's spirit departs from him (TSol 26). MAN There is no developed conception of humanity in the testament, but it is clear that apart from Solomon, who has been graciously granted special powers, human beings, who are also \"sons of Israel\" in the story (TSol 15:14), are to be contrasted with the supernatural angels and demons as \"sons of men\" and \"of earthly origin\" (TSol 5:3). As such, they are constantly subjected to all those moral, spiritual, and physical catastrophes brought on by the demons. Even the most holy men and priests can be aroused to desire (TSol 6:4). The only protection against the demonic powers is knowledge of their names, their activities, and their thwarting angels, or magical-medical formulas and praxes, all of which comes from God through Solomon and is preserved in the testament itself (TSol 15:14; 26:8). COSMOLOGY The cosmos is tripartite, with the heavens above, the earth in the middle, and hell beneath the earth (TSol 18:3). It is God's world for he is \"God of heaven and earth,\" and he dwells in the highest heaven (TSol 20:11-17). The heavens are also the abode of God's angels (TSol 5:9; 2:7), and the demons are actually \"fallen angels.\" The earth is the realm of nature and the stage for human drama, though God can interrupt natural law. Both angels and demons appear there, and demons like to frequent the more desolate places (TSol 4:4, 6; 17:2). The Prince of Demons, Beelzeboul, is said to hold men bound in Tartarus, the underworld region in control of the demon Abezethibou (TSol 6:3; 23-25). What is most characteristic of the testament's cosmology is the combination of astrology and demonology. Demons are said \"to reside\" (keimai) in a \"star\" or \"constellation\" (aster), as well as in a sign of the zodiac (TSol 2:2). One demon travels (hodeud) with the moon (TSol 4:9). The stars are usually viewed as demonic and seem to have a special destructive power over those humans who share the same constellation (TSol 2:2; 4:6). Indeed, Asmodeus is said to spread madness about women through the stars (TSol 5:8). There are two chapters which especially illustrate this notion, both dealing with the \"world rulers\" or \"heavenly bodies\" (stoicheia). In chapter 8 seven small stars, the \"rulers of this world of darkness\" (TSol 8:2), are described as seven \"vices\" (Deception, Strife, Fate, Distress, Error, Power, The Worst); each is responsible for certain religious, social, or political evils, and each (with the exception of the last) has a thwarting angel.98 In chapter 18 the stars are the thirty-six \"world rulers of the darkness of this age\" (TSol 18:2), the first of whom is called \"the first decan of the zodiac\" (TSol 18:4). This refers to the thirty-six decans, or deities, each of whom rules over 10° of the 360° zodiac, a widespread astrological concept in the ancient world.99 However, in the testament the decans are demons who cause mental and physical illnesses. DEMONOLOGY The Testament of Solomon shares with many ancient Jewish writings the belief (based 98 See above, \"Date\"; TSol 8:2, n. a. 99 See above, \"Date\"; TSol 18:2, n. a. Conybeare, JQR 11 (1898) 6-10; McCown, Testament, pp. 56-59."},{"pageNumber":1006,"pageContent":"on an interpretation of Gen 6:1-4) that the demons are fallen angels (TSol 6:2), or at least the offspring of fallen angels and human women (TSol 5:3). Sometimes in Jewish literature the offspring were thought to be giants and perhaps the testament reflects that view (TSol 17:1). One, a female demon, is said to be generated from \"a voice of the echo of a black heaven, emitted in matter\" (TSol 4:8); another demon is the \"offspring of The Great One\" (TSol 7:5). As the above summary of the contents of the testament shows, the demons are primarily spirits who take one or several forms or change forms (especially TSol 3:6; 15:5; 20:13). They can be perceived as gods if the names of their thwarting angels are unknown (TSol 5:5; cf. 14:2; 15:3). Their forms include heavenly bodies perceived as vices or persons, forces of nature such as fire or wind, mythical personages such as dragons, part animal and part human creatures such as satyrs, some of whom are female, others of whom are headless or two-headed. Beelzeboul, formerly the highest-ranking angel in heaven (TSol 6:2), is their ruler (TSol 3:6); he seems to rule over the earth as well (subject to God). Yet, though he is consulted by Kunopegos, Beelzeboul's role as Prince of the Demons is not highly developed. BeelzebouFs crony, Abezethibou, rules Tartarus, the underworld (TSol 6:3; 25). Beyond this, no complicated hierarchy of demons is developed. Almost all the demons are given names. There are \"spirits of the air, the earth, and beneath the earth\" (TSol 22:1). Many of the demons are stars or are in some way associated with the stars. Demons, as mentioned, reside in constellations and, because they can fly up to heaven (TSol 2:3), they sometimes overhear God's plans for the life of men and know the future (TSol 20:14-17). They also frequent desolate places (TSol 4:4, 6) and haunt tombs (TSol 17:2). Their major function is the implementation of all kinds of wickedness, immorality, natural disaster, deformity, disease, and death. A strikingly Christian view is found in 15:10: \"We (the demons) will lead astray all the inhabited world for a long time until the Son of God is stretched upon the cross.\" ANGELOLOGY Nothing is said of the precise origin or hierarchy of all the angels in the testament, but their major function is clear; each angel has one or more demons which he is able to render powerless or ineffective (katarged: \"I make powerless,\" \"I destroy,\" rendered below as \"I thwart\"). To know the name of the appropriate \"thwarting angel\" for a particular demon and to call on him is to gain power over that particular demon and the evil he causes. If human beings do not know the names of the thwarting angels, the demons will be worshiped as gods (TSol 5:5). The angels are also God's emissaries (TSol 1:7). Four of the seven archangels, Michael, Ouriel, Raphael, and Gabriel, are found in the testament.100 Michael, Ouriel, and Raphael are the first three angels to be mentioned by name (TSol 1:6; 2:4; 5:9) and each of the four is said to have power over one of the first four of the thirty-six heavenly bodies (TSol 18:5-8). Specifically, Michael delivers the magic ring granted by God to Solomon and announces to him that he will have power over the demons (TSol l:6f.); Michael also imprisons the first of the thirty-six heavenly bodies, Ruax, the headache demon (TSol 18:4f.). Ouriel is the first to be introduced as a thwarting angel, namely in connection with the demon Ornias (TSol 2:4); he also thwarts Error, one of the seven heavenly bodies (TSol 8:9), and imprisons Artosael, the third of the thirty-six heavenly bodies, who damages the eyes (TSol 18:7). Raphael thwarts Asmodeus (TSol 5:9) and the Medusa-like Obyzouth (TSol 13:6); he also imprisons Oropel, the fourth of the thirty-six heavenly bodies, who causes sore throat (TSol 18:8). Gabriel imprisons Barsafael, the second of the thirty-six heavenly bodies, who is also a headache demon (TSol 18:6). There are many other thwarting angels in the testament, usually with Semitic-sounding names. One is called \"The Almighty God,\" or \"Patike\" by the Hebrews, or \"Emmanouel\" by the Greeks (TSol 6:8). DUALISM The Testament of Solomon contains no absolute dualism.

Overpowered, they are put to work constructing the Temple. MAGIC, MEDICINE The major interest of the author of the testament was medical. Chapter 18 sounds very much like an ancient family medical encyclopedia.101 Here, the \"heavenly bodies,\" most of whom cause physical and mental disease, are made to \"retreat\" (anachoro) not only by reciting the magical formula, \"Angel X, imprison Demon Y\" (the first ten, the fifteenth, and the nineteenth demons), but also by certain exorcistic words, sometimes simply spoken, sometimes said in conjunction with \"medical\" rites, sometimes written, usually on various apotropaic materials, sometimes worn on the person, sometimes posted at various protective locations. For example, \"The tenth said, 4I am called Metathiax. I cause pains in the kidneys. If I hear \"Adonael, imprison Metathiax\" I retreat immediately' \" (TSol 18:14). \"Rhyx Hapax, who unleashes insomnia, retreats if anyone writes 'Kok; phedismos' and wears it from the temples\" (TSol 18:32). \"Rhyx Mianeth, who holds grudges against the body, demolishes houses, and causes flesh to rot, flees from a house if anyone writes 'Melto Ardad AnaatK on the front entrance of the house\" (TSol 18:40). Similar ideas occur in the earlier parts of the testament. The Lion-Shaped Demon, in control of a legion of demons, is adjured by the suffering Emmanouel, who binds them and who drives them over a cliff, a passage which recalls the story in Mark 5:1-13 (TSol 11:1-7). In a slight alteration of the Tobit story, Asmodeus is thwarted by Raphael (\"but also a liver and a gall of a fish smoking on coals of charcoal . . .\"), and the fish is identified as a sheatfish (TSol 5:9f.). Also an apparently dangerous form of magic is revealed—Solomon rebukes Beelzeboul for revealing it—when Solomon is told how to support his household (TSol 6:1 Of.). In the following chapter Solomon stops the wind demon Lix Tetrax by spitting on the ground and sealing him with his magic ring (TSol 7:3). ETHICS The demons involve man in actions that are contrary to traditional biblical morality. Likewise, God is a good God and his angels stand ready to thwart the demons in man's behalf. Thus, insofar as mental, physical, and moral health is a good, and mental, physical, and moral sickness is an evil, there is a strong ethical flavor in the document. AFTERLIFE There is no view of the afterlife expressed. In 25:8, Solomon adjures Abezethibou to hold up the pillar of air \"until the End,\" and in 26:8 (rec. B) Solomon writes his testament \"in order that those who hear might pray about, and pay attention to, the last things and not to the first things, in order that they might finally find grace forever.\" Relation to canonical books The Testament of Solomon has numerous connections with both the Hebrew Scriptures and the New Testament. There is only one citation, the cornerstone, or keystone, prophecy from Psalm 118:22 (TSol 23:4). Other connections appear to be non-literary. With regard to the Hebrew Scriptures, the major associations are Solomon's building the Temple (IKgs 6f.), Solomon's wisdom (IKgs 4:29-34), the story of the Queen of Sheeba (IKgs 10; TSol 19:1-3; 21:1-4), Solomon's many wives and downfall due to the worship of foreign gods (IKgs 11; TSol 26), all of which are elaborated in Jewish and Arabic folklore, and the story of the Exodus (Ex 14; TSol 6:3f.; 22:7; 23:2; 24-25). One also finds mention of the divided kingdom (IKgs 12; TSol 5:5; 15:8), the fall of the angels (Gen 6:1-4; TSol 5:3; 6:1-4), the prophecies of the Wonderful Counselor (Isa 9:6; TSol 12:3) and Emmanouel (Isa 7:14; TSol 6:8; 11:6; 15:11), and the cherubim and seraphim (IKgs 7:48f.; TSol 18:34; cf. 21:2). As mentioned above, the archangels Michael (Dan 10:13; 12:1; TSol 1:6 [n. j]; 18:5) and Gabriel (Dan 8:16; 9:21; TSol 18:6) are found. Finally, as in the hellenistic magical papyri and gnostic literature, many Semitic-sounding names occur throughout the testament, though these do not necessarily point directly to the Scriptures. See TSol 18:2, n. a."},{"pageNumber":1008,"pageContent":"The testament is also related orally to the New Testament. Conybeare isolated a number of common phrases between the New Testament and manuscript P,102 some of which are simply illustrations of a common environment. Yet, there are clear allusions to the story of the Gerasene demoniacs (Mark 5:1-13; TSol 11), and Beelzeboul occupies a major place in the documents (cf. Mk 3:22; Mt 10:25; 12:24; Lk 11:15; TSol 3; 4:2). The \"virgin\" (Mt 1:18-25; Lk 1:25-38) is implied once (TSol 15:10) and explicitly mentioned once (TSol 22:20). The implicit reference occurs in what is the clearest reference to Jesus which McCown thinks might be the work of the redactor of recension B,103 though he prints it in his eclectic text: We will lead astray all the inhabited world for a long time until the Son of God is stretched upon the cross. For there has not yet arisen a king like him, one who thwarts all of us, whose mother shall not have sexual intercourse with a man. •Who holds such authority over the spirits except that one? The one whom the first devil shall seek to tempt, but shall not be able to overcome, the letters of whose name add up to six hundred forty-four—he is Emmanouel (TSol 15:1 Of.). The virgin, the reference to the Son of God, the temptation of Jesus, Jesus' rule over the demons, the crucifixion, and the name Emmanouel are clear. Moreover, there is the curious reference to the number 644. This number is connected with the name Emmanouel in manuscript P of 6:8, which states in response to Solomon's question about a thwarting angel that the one who thwarts Beelzeboul is \"the holy and precious name of the almighty God, the one called by the Hebrews by a row of numbers, of which the sum is 644, and among the Greeks it is Emmanouel.\" [Italics mine.] Now 11:6 speaks of a suffering Emmanouel as one who thwarts the Lion-Shaped One, and adds, \"As he moves about he is conjured up by means of three letters.\" The three letters used for the number 644 in manuscript P of 6:8, however, are Greek letters (chi, mu, delta). Moreover, manuscript P of 11:6 adds, \"The 'Great Among Men' who is to suffer many things whose name is the formula 644, who is Emmanouel. . .\" It is never explicitly stated, but the Greek letters of Emmanouel's name also add up to 644 (TSol 6:8, n. i). The crucifixion of Jesus by the Jews is mentioned again in 22:20, and in a difficult passage in 12:3 the three-headed dragon spirit states, \"But there is a way by which I am thwarted, (namely,) by (the site) which is marked 'Place of the Skull,' for there an angel of the Wonderful Counselor foresaw that I would suffer, and he will dwell publically on the cross.\" An oath called \"the Elo-i,\" recalling Jesus' words on the cross from Psalm 22:1 (Mk 15:34; Mt 27:46) occurs in 6:8 and the sign of the cross written on the forehead thwarts the lecherous spirit in 17:4. Special notice should also be taken of the fact that in these references Jesus functions very much like a thwarting angel in the testament (TSol 6:8, n. h). Finally, there/are a number of general relationships such as demonology and the designation of Solomon as \"Son of David\" (TSol 1:7; 20:1) which have led some scholars to believe that the testament provides an excellent background for understanding many parts of the New Testament. Relation to apocryphal and pseudepigraphic books It is already clear that the testament shares much with the apocryphal and pseudepigraphic literature. The account of Asmodeus, who hatches plots against newly weds and is thwarted by the angel Raphael and a smoking liver and gall of a fish (TSol 5:7-10), reflects the main narrative of Tobit, though in Tobit it is the smoking heart and liver of the fish that cause Asmodeus to flee the newlyweds' bedchamber, the gall being held in reserve to cure Tobit's blindness. McCown discovered what he thought was one phrase from the Wisdom of Solomon as well (WisSol 9:4; cf. TSol 3:5).104 An important theme from the pseudepigraphic literature is the theme of the fall of the angels based on Genesis 6:1-4 (IEn 6-7; 15f.; Jub 7:21-25; 10:5; TSol 6:2; 5:3). The fourth major archangel of the testament, Ouriel, is also frequently 102 Conybeare, JQR 11 (1898) 5f. 103 McCown, Testament, pp. 83, 89. 104 McCown, Testament, p. 61."},{"pageNumber":1009,"pageContent":"found in the Pseudepigrapha (e.g. 4Ezra 5:20; 10:27; IEn 9:1; 10:1). In general, it may be said with McCown, 'The angelology and demonology of the Test are practically those of the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha.\"105 Such connections with the testament appear to have been brought about by oral traditions. Cultural importance Though the tradition of Solomon's magical wisdom was perpetuated in Judaism, Chris­tianity, and Islam—witness the growth of Solomonic legends in the Talmud, Ethiopic Christianity, the Koran, and Arabian Nights as well as the plethora of amulets, talismans, lintels, and the pentagrams and hexagrams scratched on every type of magical material—the attestation of Solomonic magical books seems to have been avoided in official Judaism until the twelfth century. The Rabbis preserved the tradition that Hezekiah hid the \"book of rec­ipes.\" Hippolytus (c. A.D. 160-236) seems to have been the first Christian writer to mention the notion of the suppression of Solomon's books by Hezekiah, an idea continued in early Christian writers, perhaps in a lost account of Eusebius.106 Clearly, in the early period, magical books by Solomon were considered suspect, partly because \"official\" Judaism and Christianity associated the practice of magic with paganism, and perhaps partly because the practice of magic in the Roman Empire was legally punishable by death.107 Nonetheless, it was quite difficult to distinguish magic from medicine and in practice it flourished everywhere in the popular culture. Thus, alongside the beloved tales of Solomon's great wisdom and magical prowess, Solomonic magical books existed and some survived the sporadic book burnings. Theodoret (A.D. 385/393-458), for example, mentions in his interpretation of 1 Kings 4:33 the existence of Solomon's \"medical books\" and praises Solomon as the source of all medical knowledge.108 The first clear reference to the testament, however, attacks Solomon's reputation by referring to his demise in 1 Kings 11:31-36. This is the Dialogue of Timothy and Aquila from about A.D. 400. Other Christian writers also attack Solomon's reputation, but usually only when claims for him come into conflict with claims about Jesus, as in the Dialogue. Where the conflict with Judaism was absent, Solomon's reputation as a healer of diseases seems, in the early period, to have been maintained.109 In the medieval period, probably about the twelfth century, and probably under Arabian influence, Solomon became known especially as a writer of scientific and magical books. M. Seligsohn mentions forty-nine of these books listed in Arabic and Hebrew literature,110 and McCown adds that this list is by no means exhaustive.111 Perhaps most famous of all these medieval works was the Key of Solomon, known in Greek, Hebrew, and Latin (Clavicula Salomonis), so named because like a key which unlocks a treasure, it was believed to unlock the mysteries of the magical arts.112 By the fifteenth century, books of magical secrets were attributed to many major characters of the Jewish Scriptures, including Adam and Moses, and especially Solomon. To this company, Zoroaster, Hermes Trismegistus, Aristotle, Alexander the Great, Virgil, and Muhammad were joined. Students of history of Western mysticism will recognize here a number of common features with the mystical Jewish cabala, which developed the myths of fallen angels found in Genesis 6:1-4 and 105 Ibid., p. 59. 106 Hippolytus, Commentary on Canticles, fragmentarily preserved; see McCown, JPOS 2 (1922) 11 and n. 3. Official Islam appears to have considered Solomonic books to be works of the devil: cf. Koran, Sura 2:951'.; McCown, Testament, pp. 98f., on Eusebius. 107 Important texts are the Laws of the Twelve Tables (451-450 B.C.); Julius Paulus, Sententiae 5:21, 1-3; 5:23, 17, 19 (early 3rd cent, A.D.); Justinian, Pandects 48:8, 13f.

In much of this there is a movement away from the testament's focus on knowledge of the demons as a way of coping with evil toward the attempt to manipulate the demons for positive benefits. Similarly, partly due to Neoplatonic influence, there was an increasing tendency to arrange the demons in hierarchies of power.113 Manuscript Td of recension C of the testament (dated by McCown to about the 12th or 13th cent.),114 represents these technical works for the professional astrologer and magician by including in chapter 10 a list of fifty or fifty-one demons who are summoned for the purpose of gaining wealth, power, and happiness. Indeed, this manuscript is really a fragment of a longer manuscript containing a whole body of magical, astrological, and demonologic lore, most notably the Key of Solomon. Many of the other manuscripts, which are from the fifteenth or sixteenth century, also contain such lore, including many pentacles and Solomonic drawings.115 In conclusion, it should be stressed that the Testament of Solomon is an important document for understanding everyday religion in the early centuries of Christianity. On the one hand, there is the romantic story of Solomon. Solomon built the temple and, according to Scripture, \"it was with stone prepared at the quarry; so that neither hammer nor ax nor any tool of iron was heard in the temple while it was being built\" (IKgs 6:7). He was a lover of women, which led to his demise. But he was also the wise king, whose knowledge included the magical properties of plants and animals. Most tantalizing is the account of his magical ring and its power over the demons.116 The story provides a backdrop for all manner of important information about sickness, disease, natural tragedy, and death: who causes it (the demons), the world in which it exists (God's mysterious world with its stars and planets), and what to do about it (knowledge about angels, medicine, and magical incantation). As such, the testament is a sample of what R. Ellwood calls the \"alternative\" religious tradition in the West.117 It arises out of the broader religious environment of which Christianity was a part rather than being a normative document of what orthodox Christianity was to become. If its thought, especially its demonology, helps clarify the type of literature that orthodoxy came to accept as normative, its basic thrust, limited in its Christology, found much in common with, and contributed to, a persistent mysticism, astrology, magic, and what has continued in the modern period as the occult.

McCown presents, with the exception of the first three VSS., an eclectic text which attempts to reconstruct the original TSol behind recs. A (MSS H I L) and B (MSS P Q). Rec. C (MSS S T U V W), he judged, was descended from rec. B and carried little weight against rec. A; however, when C agreed with A against B, he argued that this agreement came closest to the original. In rec. A, he considered MS H to be the best MS and his rule was \"When in doubt, follow H\" (McCown, Testament, p. 38). There was an exception to this generalization: McCown thought rec. A to be secondary at the beginning, and here he relied more on rec. B (for the conclusion, see Introduction, MS N; TSol 26:8, n. f). Finally, McCown printed various combinations of MSS in the first three VSS. sometimes separating, sometimes combining recs. A and B, and sometimes printing MS L separately, but always printing MSS V W separately. b. The numbers in parentheses in the margin correspond, where possible, to the paragraph num­bers of F. C. Conybeare's translation of F. F. Fleck's edition of MS P (1837), considered by McCown to contain many errors. I have attempted to follow Conybeare's paragraph divisions in most cases, despite the differences in the underlying Gk. text. These numbers will facilitate comparison with the only other English translation of the text of TSol. Furthermore, I have occasionally put variants from MSS, especially P as found in McCown, in the nn. See F. C. Conybeare, \"The Testament of Solomon,\" JQR 11 (1898) 1-45 for another trans­lation. The subheadings in bold type are those of the translator. c. This Gk. title, along with others, is printed separately by McCown, Testament, p. 99*. In ac­cord with McCown's judgments about rec. A being secondary at the beginning, I have selected the rec. B (MSS P Q) text here. MS I of rec. A reads, \"Solomon, Son of David, who reigned in Jerusa­lem; and concerning the demons whom he subdued, and what are the authorities against the demons to be granted to him by God, and by what angels the demons are thwarted, and the works of the Temple which he (so) magnificently accomplished,\" with the words \"Testament o[fl\" written by another hand and placed in the margin above. Perhaps the original Gk. implied \"concerning,\" that is, \"Con­cerning Solomon . . . and concerning the de­mons . . . ,\" and the scribe, seeing the genitive form (Solomdntos), interpreted it as a possessive genitive, or \"Testament of Solomon ...\" as in rec. B. MS H of rec. A states simply, \"An account about the Testament of Solomon, the coming of the demons, and the construction of the Temple.\" Rec. C (MSS V W), found in McCown, Testament, p. 99*, states, \"Testament of the wisest Solomon with its parallel names which were guarded as mysteries by Hezekiah after David the king died.\" There is a lengthy tradition mentioned in the Talmud (Bet 10a; Pes 56a) and found in early Christian writers that Hezekiah suppressed Solomon's mag­ical writings (cf. Introduction) and this tradition has influenced TSol C13.

Solomon is called Son of David in Gk. titles of MSS P Q I; MS L and rec. C; Prologue 1:1; rec. C 12:1; 13:12; MS D 1:1; MS E 11:1; MS H 26:9; and in McCown, TSol 1:7; 20:1. He is called \"son of the prophet David\" in MS E 1:1; 2:1. The address \"Son of David\" could be a link between the magical tradition about Solomon and the activity of Jesus as exorcist and healer. e. The Gk. verb katargeo is translated through­out TSol as \"I thwart.\" It can mean \"I make ineffective,\" \"I make powerless,\" or \"I abolish,\" \"I wipe out,\" \"I set aside.\" A usual demand of Solomon is that the demon identify the name of the thwarting angel. To know the angel who has power over a demon is to be able to ward off the demon and solve the trouble. The demon Asmodeus later indicates that if men do not know the names of demons, the latter will be worshiped as gods (TSol 5:5). The term katargeo is used to describe the annihilation of the \"lawless one\" at the coming of the Lord in 2Thes 2:8. f. McCown combined rec.

As a result he was much loved by me, Solomon, and received twice as much pay and provisions as all the other artisans. So I, Solomon, was continually rejoicing and happy, praising God for the construction of the Temple.\" MS L of rec. A reads, \"Solomon, Son of David, wanting to rebuild and construct Zion, commanded thaMhere be brought together artisans from every region and district to work on the Temple of God ...\" and continues in TSol 1:1 much like the others; see below, TSol 1:2, n. h.

The demon is capable of \"sapping\" the boy's energy by sucking it out of the thumb; see the boy's description in TSol 1:4. h. McCown, Testament, p. 8*, now begins to print all of rec. A (MSS H I L) with rec. B (MSS P Q) with variant readings of words in the apparatus; rec. C (MSS V W) reads, \"Then one day King Solomon stretched out his hands toward heaven and said, 'God of gods and alone King of kings, reveal to me the boy's complete torment for the sake of your fearful and all-holy name.'

In Jude 9, he is an \"archangel\" who contends with the devil about the body of Moses (who, according to Jewish tradition, was charged by the devil with being a murderer and therefore not worthy of burial); in Rev 12:7 he leads the angelic armies against the dragon, and his angels cause the latter to be expelled from heaven.

The an­gel Raphael has the task of binding the demon Asmodeus (Tob 3:17; 8:3; cf. TSol 5; 13:6); Ra­phael was also commanded to bind Azazel \"hand and feet, and cast him into the darkness\" (IEn 10:4; 6-13) where he would eventually be judged; the fallen angels (cf. Gen 6:1-4), described as \"stars\" and \"beasts\" (IEn90:23-24; Jub5:6; Jude 6-7; cf. TSol 5:1; 6:2), are bound presumably by the angels Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Phanuel; the hosts of Azazel will be bound in the future (IEn 54-56); and Beliar will be bound by the \"new priest\" (TLev 18:12). Also, demons are frequently bound, and portrayed as such in art, in the Aramaic Incantation Bowls. See TSol 5:12, n. p. Finally, note M. Eliade, \"The 'God Who Binds' and the Symbolism of Knots,\" ch. 3 of Images and Sym­bols, trans. P. Mairet (New York, 1969), especially p. 94, n. 9, for literature. q. The Gk. verb krazo, \"I cry out,\" like krau-gazo (n. o), is also used of demons in the NT; cf. the Gaderene demoniac (Mk 5:5) and the deaf and dumb spirit in the boy (Mk 9:26; cf. Lk 9:39). 2 a. See TSol 1:2, n. c. b. 2En 21:6 states that the twelve signs of the zodiac are above the seventh heaven and that their heavenly homes are in the ninth heaven. c. Gk. ho Hydrochoos, \"the Waterpourer.\" d. Gk. he Parthenos, \"the Virgin,\" second larg­est constellation, the goddess of love or mother goddess in myth (or Justice among the Greeks). e. Gk. haptomenou, from haptomai, \"I touch,\" \"I take hold of,\" sometimes with reference to sexual intercourse with a woman; cf. ICor 7:1. Gk. thelykos, the adjective that goes with paidion, \"child,\" \"boy,\" normally means \"feminine\" or \"effeminate.\" The reference appears to be either to sexual intercourse with young girls or sexual activity with effeminate boys. f. Cf. Origen, Contra 6.30; the devil is said to go about like a roaring lion in IPet 5:8. g. Gk. he dynamis, \"(the) power,\" seems to refer to a personal, supernatural angel, or spirit, as it frequently does in Mediterranean religions; cf. Acts 8:10. h. On the thwarting angel, see Title, n. e. i. Seven archangels are named in IEn 20:If. as Uriel (\"over the world and over Tartarus\"), Ra­phael (\"over the spirits of men\"), Raguel (\"takes vengeance on the world of luminaries\"), Michael (\"set over the best part of mankind and over chaos\"), Saraqael (\"set over the spirits, who sin in the spirit\"), Gabriel (\"over Paradise and the serpents and the cherubim\"), and Remiel (\"over those who rise\"); cf. IEn 9:1; 10:1. The four archangels that are prominent in TSol—Michael, Uriel, Raphael, and Gabriel—are well attested to­gether in Judaism in general and magic in particular. Uriel is probably Suriel, mentioned in Origen, Con­tra 6.30, as \"bull-like.\" In magical materials, he is lord of the second or third heaven. See TSol 18:7, n. k. j. The Babylonian Talmud (b. G\\\\\\ 68ab) tells the story that Solomon sought the coveted stone-cutting worm, the shamir, to help build the Temple. After binding a male and a female demon, Solomon sent Benaiahu to get the shamir from the Prince of Demons, Ashmedai; to bind him, Benaiahu was given, among other things, a chain and a ring, each engraved with the divine name. See Introduction. k. Conybeare, JQR 11 (1898) 18, n. 1, recalls the tradition in folklore that the evil demons fear iron; cf. T. Hopfner, Griechisch-dgyptischer Of-fenbarungszauber, 2 vols.

The Heb. bacal-zebub is probably a contemptuous corruption of a Philistine god (2Kgs 1:2, 6), its obvious meaning being \"lord of the flies.\" LXX MSS have Beelzeboul, perhaps refer­ring to Ugaritic Aleyan Baal, \"Baal Prince.\" b. The Gk. phrase ton son thronon paredron sophian [or sophon], \"Wisdom, the attendant of your thrones,\" occurs in WisSol 9:4.

In Tob, Raphael instructs Tobit to remove the gall, heart, and liver of a fish taken from the Tigris River (see \"rivers of Assyria\" in the next vs.), promising that they will be useful for medication. In Media, Raphael tells Tobit that the smoking heart and liver before a man or woman who is attacked by a demon or evil spirit will result in the demon's fleeing forever; this method is then applied by Tobit against Asmodeus on Tobit's and Sarah's wedding night; see TSol 5, nn. a and g. Raphael then pursues the demon to Egypt, where he binds and fetters him (TSol 1:13, n. r). The gall is later used to cure Tobit's blindness. In TSol, the liver and gall are smoked. ) 1.

Origen (Contra 8.58) wrote that \"among these demons, even down to the least ones, there exists some one or another to whom authority (ex-ousia) has been given, may be learned by any one from what the Egyptians say, namely, that thirty-six demons, or ethereal gods of a kind, have dis­tributed among themselves man's body, which is apportioned into a corresponding number of parts. Some say the number of these demons is much greater. One demon then is appointed to take care of one part and another of another. Of these demons they know the names in the local speech (i.e. Cop­tic), as, for example, Khnoumen, and Khnakou-men, and Knat, and Sikat, and Bion, and Eron, and Erebion, and Ramanor, and Reianoor, and the rest of the names used in their tongue. And, of course, by invoking these demons, they cure the sufferings of the several parts\" (Conybeare, JQR 11 [1898] 7). Whereas Celsus stated that propitiation of these demons was necessary for health, Origen replied from Phil 2:10 that all are subject to Jesus and that Christians need only trust in the living God. For the stoicheia as the seven demonic stars, see TSol 8:2, n. a, where it is noted that Origen (Contra 6.30) also speaks of the Seven Ruling Demons. g. Perhaps Rhyx; cf. TSol 18:24-35. The first decan is most important; the name may mean \"the Lord\" (Gundel, Dekane, pp. 50f.) and be related to rex, \"ruler,\" \"king,\" \"prince.\" It corresponds to Sro, the ram, in Manilius' list of decans. h. On Michael, cf. Introduction; TSol l:6f. and n. q; NHC II, 1:77,30. i. On Gabriel, cf. Introduction; NHC III, 2:52, 23;JJ,6;57,[7];<54,26; VHI,1:57,9;5S,22. j.

Studies for Morton Smith at Sixty, ed. J. Neusner (Studies in Judaism in Late Antiquity 12.3; (Leiden, 1975). Uriel is also common in gnostic texts; cf. NHC Index in The Nag Hammadi Library in English (Oroiael, Oriel, Oroiel, Ariael, Ouriel). 1.

Gundel (Dekane, p. 51) suggests the name is built up out of kairod, \"I fit the right point in time,\" xaind, \"to comb (wool), to make it fit for spinning,\" and dalos, \"torch,\" and could be anal­ogous to the decan Lampadias, the \"torch carrier.\" p. Ourouel: a variation of Uriel? Cf. TSol 18:7, n. k above. q. Gundel (Dekane, p. 50) suggests the root sphendone, \"a sling,\" or anything shaped like it, in this case the arrow of the protector, or the ax. r. Conybeare (JQR 11 [1898] 35, n. 5): \"The Greek medical terms which stand in the Greek text are found in Hippocrates, Galen, and Cael.

Gundel (Dekane, p. 52) suggests (cautiously) the goddess Satis, or the decan-goddess Krebses. y. In addition to gnostic materials and magical papyri, amulets contain such names, e.g. Good-enough, Jewish Symbols, p. 229: \"Iao, Sabao, Michael, Gabriel, Ouriel, Cheroubin, Serapi[n].\" This amulet also contains the cavalier, e.g. Solo­mon. z. Gundel (Dekane, p. 52) thinks it likely that the name is built out of sapha, \"clearly,\" and thoraios, another name for Apollo, i.e. \"the one who is fit for the seed, the one who qualified for procreating.\" He relates him to the Egyptian New Year. a2. In NHC II, 5:106, Sabaoth begets Death, who begets seven androgynous sons who beget forty-nine androgynous demons; in 107 the text states, \"Their names and their functions you will find in 'the Book of Solomon.' \" Cf. Introduction. Sabaoth occurs frequently in the Nag Hammadi texts. b2. Gundel (Dekane, p. 52) suggests a person­ification of phobos, \"fear,\" who may be related to the old decan Knuphis, who is called to protect against evil powers. c2. Adonai, \"my Lord,\" from the Heb. Bible, is common to gnosticism and magic; Gundel (De­kane, p. 60) thinks he is placed here to show his power over the gods of the Egyptian pantheon. d2. Gundel (Dekane, p. 52) guesses the name might refer to a windbag, buffoon, gossip, or also to ornaments and jewelry. e2. Gk. hoti kallion esti Solomon hendeka pa-teron, \"because Solomon is fairer than eleven fath­ers.\" Gk. kallion, \"fairer,\" could mean \"more powerful.\" Gk.paterdn, \"fathers,\" might refer to demons, so Lampe, p. 1051; cf. TSol 22:20, n. a (MS P). For the view that the eleven fathers are gnostic, see McCown (Testament, p. 82). f2. Gundel (Dekane, p. 52) suggests this decan might mean either a peacock or a cat. g2.

Gundel (Dekane, p. 58) associates the \"eight fathers\" with the Egyptian deities of the Ogdoas, the archetypal \"Eight.\" As the original Father and Mother, they are the foundation of everything through their power. o2. In white magic, protection of openings of dwellings where demons might enter is necessary; cf. W. K.

Mardero, suggests Gundel (Dekane, p. 53) combined a rare word for \"hand,\" mare, and derd, \"to skin,\" \"to flay,\" with reference to the hand of the virgin. q2. On Rhyx, see TSol 18:4, n. g. Nathotho, according to Gundel (Dekane, p. 53) could be the moon-god Thoth, found in old Egyptian decan lists; it could also be a combination of naos, \"temple,\" and thos, \"cow,\" \"jackal.\" r2. Gundel (Dekane, p. 59) suggests that Phou-nebiel is based on the deity Phtah-Nun, the father of Atum. s2. Alath, says Gundel (Dekane, p. 53), might be a name for the wargod Mars, and would therefore be related to the Egyptian wargod Horus. t2. Rarideris, writes Gundel (Dekane, p. 58), might reflect the Egyptian goddess Thueris, who appears as a hippopotamus or a pig among the decans. u2. Gk. bastazei, \"carries\" (on one's person) or perhaps \"touches\" (the infant). v2. Gundel (Dekane, p. 53) states that the Heb. author substituted a Syrian sun-god Aumos.

Gk. astochesantos, \"which has failed (to make harbor)\"; Lampe, p. 247, suggests \"which has been lost.\" z2. Gk. aeriou, \"of air,\" is possible. A. Au-dollent (Defixionum Tabellae [Frankfurt, 1904; repr. 1967] p. 328) suggests Marmaroth means \"Lord of lords\" (Aram, mar means \"lord\"). Gun­del (Dekane, p. 59) suggests a derivation from marmaird, \"to flash,\" \"to sparkle,\" \"to glisten,\" and aoth, or Jaoth, for Yahweh. This would then be \"the glittering, shining God,\" recalling the Gk. names of the planets Phaethon and Phainon. Cf. TSol 8:7 in which Marmaroth (note spelling) thwarts Fate, who encourages war, leading Gundel to make the association with Mars. Cf. TSol 18:33. a3. Gundel (Dekane, p. 53) suggests a connec­tion of Anatreth with the sun-god Re (Ret, Rat, Srat) or with the Gk. word anatretos, suggesting \"boring through,\" since an old Egyptian decan is called \"The One Who Bores Through.\" b3. Gk. zeseis, \"seethings,\" \"efferves­cences,\" \"boilings.\" c3. Arara, Arare, is mentioned in the Gk.

Gundel (Dekane, p. 54) suggests Enautha contains either the goddess of the heaven, Nut, or the Gk. verb enaud with the meaning \"to start a fire,\" having to do with ancient Gk. and Egyptian notions of fire. e3. For Axesbuth, Gundel (Dekane, p. 54) pro­poses a derivation from axetos, \"unpolished,\" \"coarse,\" and bythos, \"(the) deep,\" suggesting the Indie decan associated with a snake. f3.

Hapax, according to Gundel (Dekane, p. 54), might be associated with the Gk. word hapax, \"one time,\" perhaps containing number symbol­ism; the variant Harpax refers to a decan with long, sharp teeth. h3. Gundel (Dekane, p. 55) suggests Anoster could contain the word nostos, \"a return home,\" and could refer to an evil demon who prevents one from returning home. i3. On Marmaraoth, cf. TSol 18:28; TSol 8:7 (Marmaroth). j3. For cherubim and seraphim on a protective amulet, see above, TSol 18:15, n. y; cf. also NHC 0,5:705.19; Vn, 2:54,34; IX, 1:70,4. k3. Gundel (Dekane, p. 55) thinks, cautiously, that Aleureth could be related to aleuron, \"wheat flour,\" and thus the Egyptian name for the wine press; it could also have to do with the decan of trouble and tribulation. 13. Was Ichthuon suggested by ichthuos, \"fish,\" in the previous vs. (TSol 18:35)? m3. On Adonai, see TSol 18:17, n. c2. n3. Gundel (Dekane, p. 55) attempts an expla­nation of Achoneoth in relation to the Egyptian decans Chont-har and Chont-chre (rams), modified by the Gk. Anchonion, suggestive of hangman or strangler, yielding a throat god or a strangler god; note that he causes sore throat and tonsillitis. o3. Gk. botrydon anachdris is not clear. Gk. botrydon means \"in clusters,\" or \"like a bunch of grapes.\" Gk. anachdris is obscure; perhaps it was originally anachdsis, \"raising an embankment.\" p3. In Phtheneoth, Gundel (Dekane, p. 55) sees Phtha, the Egyptian god of the art of forging metals. q3. On the \"much suffering eye,\" usually thought to be a protection against the \"evil eye,\" cf. C. Bonner, Studies in Magical Amulets Chiefly Graeco-Egyptian (Ann Arbor, 1950) pp. 96-100; Goodenough, Jewish Symbols, vol. 2, pp. 238-41. Both Solomon and the \"seal of Solomon\" are found on \"much suffering eye\" amulets; the \"much suf­fering eye,\" if Bonner is correct in his interpreta­tion, based partly on this vs., is found on the synagogue at Dura; cf. Goodenough, vol. 2, p. 238, and figs. 1065, 1066. r3. Gundel (Dekane, p. 58) says Ar-ta, an Egyp­tian creator god, is hidden in Ardad; in Anaath is Neith, an Egyptian crocodile god. s3.

The introduction of the Queen of Sheeba at this point seems strange; moreover, her admiration for the Temple in TSol 21 is unrelated to the story of the old man.

Then take hold of the wineskin and (place) the ring in front of the neck of the flask 11 (against the wind). »As the flask is being filled with air, you will discover that it is the demon who is filling it up. Carefully, then, tie up the flask tightly and when you have sealed (it) with the ring, load up the camel and come back here. Be off, now, with blessings.\" 12 Then the boy obeyed the orders and went to Arabia. Now the men from the 20) region doubted whether it was possible to bring the evil spirit under control. 13 Nonetheless, before dawn the house servant got up and confronted the spirit of the wind. He put the flask on the ground and placed the ring on (its mouth). (The 14 demon) entered the flask and inflated it. »Yet the boy stood firm. He bound up the mouth of the flask in the name of the Lord Sabaoth and the demon stayed inside is the flask. #To prove that the demon had been overcome, the boy remained three days and, (when) the spirit did not blow any longer, the Arabs concluded that he had really trapped the spirit. The Arabian wind demon, named Ephippas, is brought to the Temple, where it is interrogated by Solomon and puts the immovable cornerstone in place 16 Then he loaded the flask on the camel. The Arabs sent the boy on his way with 21) gifts and honors, shouting praises to God, for they were left in peace. Then the 17 boy brought in the spirit and put it in the foremost part of the Temple. •The following day I, Solomon, went into the Temple (for) I was very worried about the cornerstone. (Suddenly,) the flask got up, walked for seven steps, and fell is down on its mouth before me. »I was amazed that (even though the demon was entrapped in) the flask, he had the power to walk around, and I ordered him to get 19 up. Panting, the flask arose and stood up. •Then I asked him, saying, \"Who are you?\" From inside the spirit said, \"I am a demon called Ephippas (and I live) in Arabia.\" 20 I said to him, \"By what angel are you thwarted?\" He said, \"By the one who 22) is going to be born from a virgin and be crucified by the Jews.\"a 22 a.

ROBINSON The Testament of Adam is divided into three sections known as the Horarium, or hours of the day and night, the Prophecy, and the Hierarchy. The first two sections are attributed to Adam, and Adam speaks in the first person; the third section is not attributed to any specific figure. In the first section, the Horarium, Adam speaks to his son Seth, listing the hours of the day and night and revealing to him which portion of the created world praises God at each hour. In the second section, the Prophecy, Adam reveals information to Seth about the creation and fall of man and foretells the Flood, the birth, passion, and death of Christ, and the final end of the world. At the end of this section, Seth adds that he has personally recorded the testament of his father, Adam, and that he buried it in the legendary Cave of Treasures. The third section, the Hierarchy, is a list of the nine different orders of heavenly beings (angels, archangels, powers, etc.) and a description of the function of each of the nine orders in the divine economy. Texts The Syriac Testament of Adam is found in three recensions, witnessed by eight manuscripts which date between the early ninth and late eighteenth centuries. Of these three recensions, recension 1 is the most original.1 The most important manuscript for recension 1 is British Museum MS Add 14,624 (MS A, 9th cent.). This is the oldest and most important of all the Syriac manuscripts and serves as the base for the translation of the Horarium and Prophecy which follows. The second witness for recension 1 is Vatican Syriac MS 58 (MS B, late 16th cent.). In the translation that follows, lacunae in A have been restored according to B. The Hierarchy is found in only one Syriac manuscript, the best witness for recension 2, Vatican Syriac MS 164 (A.D. 1702). The translation of the Hierarchy is taken from this manuscript. Recension 3 is witnessed by four manuscripts, three of which contain only the Horarium. The fourth, Vatican Syriac MS 159 (A.D. 1632), contains both the Horarium and the Prophecy. One of the other witnesses to recension 3, British Museum MS Arund Or 53 (16th cent., referred to below as E), contains several important variants. Original language The Testament of Adam is extant in Syriac, Greek, Arabic, Karshuni, Ethiopic, Old Georgian, and Armenian. M. R. James was also of the opinion that a quotation in Latin by Nicetas of Remesiana was taken from the Testament of Adam, although this is uncertain.2 Three languages have been proposed as the original of the Testament of Adam: Hebrew, 1 See G. J. Reinink, \"Das Problem des Ursprungs des Testamentes Adams,\" OCA 197 (1972) 391-95, especially n. 19; see also S. E. Robinson, The Testament of Adam: An Examination of the Syriac and Greek Traditions, pp. 46, 102-4. The author is indebted to J. H. Charlesworth for his invaluable aid in the preparation of both the dissertation and the present article. 2 See M. R. James, \"Notes on Apocrypha,\" JTS 7 (1906) 562f., and Robinson, Testament of Adam, pp. 13f."},{"pageNumber":1043,"pageContent":"Greek, and Syriac. The other languages in which the testament is extant are excluded from consideration by the relatively late dates of their development. The Karshuni and Ethiopic are dependent upon the Arabic, but the Arabic is dependent upon Syriac recension 3 and repeats its errors and expansions.3 The only evidence for a Hebrew original of the testament is the appearance in one of the Greek manuscripts of Hebrew names for each of the hours. M. R. James and others have suggested that these Hebrew names represent the last vestiges of the original Hebrew text. However, examination reveals that these names are not in fact Hebrew but rather Greek words written in Hebrew characters.4 F. Nau suggested that the Testament of Adam was originally written in Greek by Apollonius of Tyana. This is untenable for several reasons. First, the extremely large number of biblical allusions in the text make it unlikely that it was written by a pagan. Second, none of the Greek manuscripts is older than the fifteenth century, and all of them employ Byzantine vocabulary not attested before the tenth century A.D., by which time the Testament of Adam had already been circulating in Syriac for six hundred years. Third, the Greek version corresponds most closely with Syriac recension 3, the least reliable of the Syriac recensions. There can be little doubt that the original language of the Testament of Adam is Syriac, since it has been convincingly shown that the Greek text is dependent upon the Syriac.5 None of the variant readings in the Syriac text seem to be instances of alternate translations of the same Greek word, or of mistranslated Greek words, as we should expect if Greek were the original language, but are rather a result of the scribes having mistaken one Syriac word for another.6 Further, there are several striking paronomasiae in the Prophecy section which are possible only in Syriac. The Hierarchy section is extant only in Syriac and quotes Zechariah 1:8 according to the Syriac Peshitta version of the Old Testament rather than the Septuagint version.7 Finally, the Testament of Adam is known to have been circulating in Syriac by the late fourth century A.D., centuries before there is evidence of its existence in any other language. Date The three sections of the Testament of Adam were not written at the same time, but the final Christian redaction, in which the testament took on its present form, probably occurred in the middle or late third century A.D. This tentative date for the final redaction of the Testament of Adam is supported by several bits of evidence. First, the testament is familiar with the Christian traditions found in the New Testament and must therefore be dated after, say, A.D. 100. Second, part of the Prophecy section is quoted in the Syriac Transitus Mariae, which is dated in the late fourth century. Third, the Testament of Adam demonstrates a literary relationship at one point with the Coptic Apocalypse of Elijah, which is dated in the third century A.D. Ordinarily this might be due to copying at some later date, but here the Testament of Adam seems to preserve the passage (a description of the signs of the Messiah) in a more original form than does the Apocalypse of Elijah and should probably not be dated after that document. Since the Jewish portions of the testament are likely older than the Christian additions, the Horarium and perhaps some of the Prophecy may date from considerably before the third century A.D. The final section, the Hierarchy, is an accretion which does not lend itself to a firm dating, although it may have been composed between the second and fifth centuries A.D.8 3 See E. Bratke, \"Handschriften Uberlieferung und Bruchstucke der Arabisch-aethiopischen Petrusapokalypse,\" ZWT 1 (1893) 493; S.

While it was most likely written in Syria or Palestine, the precise location is unknown. Historical importance Historically, the Testament of Adam witnesses a pattern in its composition which is also found in some other documents among the Pseudepigrapha. An originally Jewish composition has been redacted (heavily in the Prophecy, lightly in the Horarium and Hierarchy) by a Christian.9 The original work, or works if the sections are considered to have circulated separately, has been transformed from a Jewish Midrash on the creation story to a defense of the Church's claim that Jesus was the Messiah. The Testament of Adam thus reflects the high regard in which Jewish traditions were held by many Christians. It also reflects the willingness of some Christians to modify and expand those traditions in support of their own theological position. Theological importance In the Testament of Adam, God is represented primarily as the creator of the world and all that is in it. He receives praises at each hour of the day and night from some portion of his creation. There is no dualism; God is the creator of all, including both angels and devils, good and evil, and all things render him proper reverence. There is a definite order to creation and a proper time for every function. In this the document is reminiscent of Jewish wisdom literature. In the Testament of Adam the cosmos is depicted in familiar Old Testament terms. However, the Flood is said to have been caused by the daughters of Cain, and the career of the world is to last for six thousand years after the Flood, or, presumably, for seven thousand years in all. One striking theological feature of the Testament of Adam is that Adam is intended from the beginning to become a god; his deification is promised in no uncertain terms (3:2,4). The fall of man is seen as an unfortunate misstep, but the outcome is sure: Adam will become a god. The forbidden fruit is identified as the fig. The most fully developed doctrine in the Testament of Adam is its angelology, although this is confined mainly to the latest section of the testament, the Hierarchy. While angels and demons are referred to in the Horarium, and both cherubim and seraphim are mentioned, the Hierarchy describes all nine orders of angels and specifies their functions. Angels, the lowest order, act as guardians for human beings. Archangels, the next order, direct the affairs of the rest of creation, human beings excluded. Archons control the weather. Authorities have jurisdiction over the heavenly lights: the sun, the moon, and the stars. The powers keep the demons from destroying the world in general and human beings in particular. Dominions have authority over political kingdoms and grant victory or administer defeat in battle. Angels called \"thrones\" guard the gate of the holy of holies and stand before the throne of the Lord. Cherubim carry the throne of the Lord and are the keepers of the divine seals. Seraphim serve the inner chamber of the Lord. Relation to canonical books Despite its extensive Christian additions, the Testament of Adam is a pseudepigraphon of the Old Testament. Both the Horarium and Prophecy dwell on the themes of creation and the story of Adam and Eve found in Genesis 1-3. It is likely that these two sections were originally Midrashic expansions of the account of the creation in Genesis.10 Moreover, the Horarium demonstrates striking similarities to Psalm 148, which also deals with the 9 Robinson, Testament of Adam, pp. 156-60. 10 M. R. James, \"Apocrypha,\" in Encyclopedia Biblica (New York, 1899) vol. 1, col. 253. See also Robinson, Testament of Adam, pp. 156-60."},{"pageNumber":1045,"pageContent":"themes of the creation. Other biblical allusions and quotations may be found at Testament of Adam 1:3 (Ps 148:7f.), 1:4 (Isa 6:1-6 and Ezek 3:13), 1:5 (Gen l:7f.; Ps 148:4; and Ezek 1:24), 1:12 (Ps 104:4), 2:lf. (Ps 148:lf.), 2:10 (Gen 1:2), 4:7 (Zech 1:7-11). Relation to apocryphal books Beyond its dependence on the Old and New Testaments, the Testament of Adam manifests a clear literary relationship with several other books from the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha, and with rabbinic Judaism. Of particular significance are the parallels to the story of Adam and Eve found elsewhere in Jewish literature. The Testament of Adam has much in common with the Life of Adam and Eve (both the Vita and the ApMos), with the gnostic Apocalypse of Adam found at Nag Hammadi, and with the Armenian Death of Adam. Particularly, Adam's prediction of the Flood (3:5) is found also in Josephus' Antiquities 1.2.3 and in the Apocalypse of Adam 69:2-70:9. The death and burial of Adam (3:6) is found in the Apocalypse of Moses 33:1-40:2, Vita Adae et Evae 45:3-46:1, Jubilees 4:29, and in the Armenian Death of Adam. The sisters of Cain and Abel mentioned in the Testament of Adam are a commonplace in rabbinic writing (GenR 22.2, 7; PRE 21; Yeb 62a). The identification of the fig as the forbidden fruit from recension 2 (3:4a) is also found in the Apocalypse of Moses 20:4f. and Genesis Rabbah 15. The Testament of Adam shares a common passage with the Coptic Apocalypse of Elijah (ApEl 3:5-11), although the passage in the testament appears to be more original (TAdam 3:1; see also recension 2). The passage is a description of the signs of the Messiah based on Jesus' miracles in the New Testament, but in the Apocalypse of Elijah it has been adapted to describe the deceits of the Antichrist. The testament itself has influenced several later compositions, including the Syriac Transitus Mariae (late 4th cent.), and the Arabic Book of the Rolls (c. 8th—9th cent.). The angelology of the Hierarchy appears to have influenced the Book of the Bee by Solomon of Basra (13th cent.) and may also have influenced the Celestial Hierarchy of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite (c. A.D. 500). SELECT BIBLIOGRAPHY Charlesworth, PMR, pp. 91f. Denis, Introduction, pp. 7-14. Frey, J. B. \"Adam (Livres apocryphes sous son nom),\" DBSup, vol. 1, cols. 117-25. Gibson, M. D.

He will perform APAdam 76:8 signs and wonders on the earth, will walk on the waves of the sea. He will rebuke ApEi 3:5-n the winds and they will be silenced. He will motion to the waves and they will stand still! He will orJen the eyes of the blind and cleanse the lepers. He will cause the deaf to hear, and the mute to speak. He will straighten the hunchbacked, strengthen the paralyzed, find the lost, drive out evil spirits, and cast out demons. \"He spoke to me about this'in Paradise after I picked some of the fruit in which death was hiding: 4Adam, Adam do not fear. You wanted to be a god; I will make you a god,b not right now, but after a space of many years. I am consigning you to death, and the maggot and the worm will eat your body.' *\"And I answered APMOS 13:26 and said to him, 'Why, my Lord?' And he said to me, 'Because you listened to the words of the serpent, you and your posterity will be food for the serpent. But after a short time there will be mercy on you because you were created in my image, and I will not leave you to waste away in Sheol. For your sake I will be bom of the Virgin Mary. For your sake I will taste death and enter the house of the dead.

And after the Flood there will be six thousand years (left) to the form of the world, and then its end will come.\" And I, Seth, wrote this testament. And my father died, and they buried him at vua 45:2 the east of Paradise opposite the first city built on the earth, which was named Jub4:29 (after) Enoch. And Adam was borne to his grave by the angels and powers of heaven because he had been created in the image of God.

And the sons APMOS 29.5f. of kings, the magi, will come and get them, and they will take them to the son of God, to Bethlehem of Judea, to the cave.g The End of the Testament of Our Father Adam. 3 a. The widespread tradition of Adam's prophecy of future world history is also found in Ant 1.2.3; ApAd 64:2-6 and 85:19-31; Vita 25:lf.; and in the Armenian Death of Adam (M. Stone, \"The Death of Adam—An Armenian Adam Book,\" HTR 59 [1966] 283-91). b. The explicit promise of deification to Adam is unexpected but not without precedent. Cf. Jn 10:33-36. c. Here rec. 2 adds, \"And I, Seth, said to my father, Adam, 'What is the name of the fruit you ate?' And he said to me, 'The fig, my son, was the gate by which death entered into me and my posterity, and by it life shall come to me and to my children when our Lord becomes a man through the virgin and puts on a holy body at the end of the ages.' \" d. The Syr. can be read \"I heard in the begin­ning\" or \"you have heard, my son Seth,\" although the word division and diacritical marks clearly intend the latter. In rec. 2 these indicate the former, in a clear example of a variant which could arise only in Syr. e. See also GenR 22.7 and PRE 21; L.

Listen, my beloved,b as they are set in order one after another from the bottom, until we reach those who carry our Lord Jesus the Messiah and bear him up. The lowest order is the angels.c And the plan has been revealed to it by God concerning every human being whom they watch over, because one angel from this lowest order accompanies every single human being in the world for his protection. And this is its service. The second order is the archangels. This is the service: directing everything in this creation according to the plan of God, whether powers or animals, birds, or creeping things, or fish, and to speak briefly and in short, whatever exists in this creation, besides human beings, they care for it and guide it. The third order, which is the archons. This is its service: moving the air so that a cloud rises from the ends of the earth, according to the words of David the prophet, and rain falls upon the earth. And this (order) makes all the variations in the atmosphere, sometimes rain and sometimes snow and sometimes hail and sometimes dust and sometimes blood. And it varies them. These also belong to this (order): thunder and the fire of lightning. The fourth order, which is authorities. This is its service: the administration of the lights, of the sun and the moon and the stars. The fifth order, which is the powers. This is its service: they keep the demons from destroying the creation of God out of their jealousy toward human beings; for if the cursed nature of the demons were allowed to accomplish the lust of its will, in an hour and a moment they would overthrow the whole creation. But the divine power stops them, for a watch is set over them lest they succeed in achieving the lust of their will. The sixth order, which is the dominions. This is its service: they rule over kingdoms, and in their hands are victory and defeat in battle. And this is shown (to be) so by (the example of) the Assyrian king. For when he went up against Jerusalem, an angel descended and ravaged the camp of the wicked, and one hundred eighty-five thousand died in one moment. • And also the blessed Zechariah 2Kgs 19:35 saw the angel in the form of a man riding on a red horse standing among the trees ^^hi-ii of the tabernacle, and following him (were others on) white and red horses with lances in their hands. And Judah the Maccabee also saw the angel riding on a red 2Mac 3:24-26 horse all decked out with gold trappings. When they saw him, the camp of Antiochus the wicked fled before him. And wherever there is victory or defeat, these bestow it at the prompting of the living God, who commands them in the hour of battle. These other orders, thrones and seraphim and cherubim, stand before the majesty of our Lord Jesus the Messiah and serve the throne of his magnificence, glorifying him hourly with their \"holy, holy, holy.\" The cherubim bear up and reverence his throne and keep the seals; the seraphim serve the inner chamber of our Lord; the thrones guard the gate of the holy of holies. This is truly the explanation of the services according to the plan of the angels in this world. By the Power of Our Lord's Help the End of the Writing, the Testament of Our Father Adam. 4 a.
