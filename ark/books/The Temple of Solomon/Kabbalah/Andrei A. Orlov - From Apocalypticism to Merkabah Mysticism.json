I am thankful to the editors of thesejournals for permission to re-use the material.The format and the style of the original publications have beenchanged to comply with the standards of the collection. Some alter-ations also have been made due to printing errors or obvious errorsof fact. Some footnotes have been omitted as they appeared in morethan one article. Slavonic citations of2Enochhave been standardizedwhere it is possible in accordance with Sokolov’s edition. All Russianbibliographical references are given according to the new orthogra-phy.While numerous bibliographical tools were consulted in prepara-tion of the bibliographical section on Slavonic pseudepigrapha, spe-cial recognition is due to Lorenzo DiTommaso’sA Bibliography of Pseude-pigrapha Research1850–1999(JSPSS,39;Sheffield: Sheffield AcademicPress,2001) and Dmitrij Lihachev’sСловарь книжников и книжностиДревней Руси(Ленинград,1987–89).I owe special thanks to my colleagues at the Department of Theol-ogy of Marquette University for their continued human and scholarlysupport and encouragement.I would like to express my appreciation to Pat Anderson, BogdanBucur, Silviu Bunta, Christopher Dorn, Rachel Elior, Basil Lourié,Oleg Makariev, Nikolai Seleznyov, and Lisa Stephenson who read themanuscript and offered numerous helpful suggestions.

He stressed that the influence ofpseudepigraphic writings “on the subsequent development of Jewishmysticism cannot be overlooked” since they “undoubtedly contain ele-ments of Jewish mystical religion.”2Recent studies of the origin of early Jewish mysticism have not en-gaged in any systematic treatment of several Jewish pseudepigraphicmaterials that have survived solely in their Slavonic translations.

These writings have never been studied collectively for their pos-sible connections with early Jewish mysticism. Although Hugo Ode-berg, Gershom Scholem, Ithamar Gruenwald, and other students ofearly Jewish mystical traditions occasionally referred to these texts intheir research, pointing to certain provocative allusions that seem toconnect these pseudepigrapha with the imagery and conceptual worldof the later Merkabah and Hekhalot materials, critics of Scholem’sapproach have often ignored this important evidence. Despite their for-mal acknowledgement of the importance of these pseudepigraphic textsfor the history of early Jewish mysticism, even Odeberg, Scholem, andGruenwald have not ventured into systematic study of the evidence ofJewish mystical traditions in the Slavonic pseudepigrapha. The mainobstacle, in my judgment, to such work has been the challenge of theSlavonic language which most scholars have tended to view as “eso-teric.”It appears that one of the important tasks in clarifying the origins ofearly Jewish mysticism lies in systematic investigation of such writingsas2Enoch,theApocalypse of Abraham,andtheLadder of Jacoband inunderstanding their role in the shaping of the imagery and conceptsof subsequent Jewish mystical developments.It should be noted that2Enoch,theApocalypse of Abraham,andtheLadder of Jacobrepresent a unique group of texts that share a theophanicand mediatorial language that, in my view, is as different from themainstream of early apocalyptic and pseudepigraphic writings as it is(AGJU,14; Leiden: Brill,1980),50–51; J.

This group of materials gives evidence ofthe lostpracticalandliterarydevelopment that could very well representan important transitional stage in early Jewish mystical testimonies,serving as a bridge from the matrix of early Jewish apocalypticism, asit was manifested in early Enochic literature, to the matrix of earlyJewish mysticism as it became manifest in rabbinic Merkabah andHekhalot materials. The articles gathered in this volume intend toillustrate this transitional character of the Slavonic pseudepigraphicevidence by exploring theophanic and angelological imagery foundin2Enoch,theLadder of Jacob, the Slavonic version of3Baruchandother pseudepigraphical texts preserved in Slavonic.4It appears that thetheophanic and angelological developments found in these documentsoccupy an intermediary stage between Second Temple apocalypticismand Hekhalot mysticism and thus exhibit its own distinctive, one mightsay “proto-Hekhalot,” mystical mold. For example, the Slavonic Enoch,similar to some of the Hekhalot writings, already operates with theconcept of Metatron and his later titles, such as the Youth, which areabsent from early Enochic writings but prominent in such Hekhalotmacroforms asSefer HekhalotandHekhalot Rabbati.Another important feature of the pseudepigraphical documents in-vestigated in this volume is their polemical thrust that facilitated theaforementioned transition from Jewish apocalypticism to early Jewishmysticism. Slavonic pseudepigraphical texts show an intricate web ofmediatorial debates in the course of which the several traditions aboutexalted patriarchs and prophets prominent in Second Temple Judaism,including Adam, Enoch, Moses, Jacob, Melchizedek, and Noah, under-go polemical appropriation in which their exalted features are trans-ferred to the rival exalted heroes. These polemical tendencies seem toreflect the familiar atmosphere of mediatorial debates widespread inthe Second Temple period that offered competing accounts for the pri-macy and supremacy of their exalted heroes. The polemics found inthe Slavonic pseudepigraphons are part of these debates and representa response of Enochic, Adamic, Noachic, Jacobite, and Mosaic tradi-tions to the challenges of their rivals.This collection of studies is to be seen as only a preliminary step inthe larger task of appropriating the Slavonic pseudepigraphic evidence4Although some articles included in this volume do not deal directly with theSlavonic texts they nevertheless provide important insights into the afterlife of theJewish pseudepigraphical texts and traditions in the Eastern Christian environment."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"106from apocalypticism to merkabah mysticismfor understanding the origins of early Jewish mysticism.

One of thesefeatures includes the fact that Josephus credited Seth’s descendantswith the discovery of “the science of the heavenly bodies and theirorderly array.” Scholars have noted that this role from ancient time wastraditionally ascribed to Enoch,2who in various Enochic traditions isportrayed as an expert in cosmological, astronomical and calendaricalsecrets.1Josephus,Jewish Antiquities(LCL; tr. H.S.J. Thackeray; Cambridge: Harvard Uni-versity Press/London: Heinemann,1967),4.33.2J. VanderKam observes that in the passage about the discovery of astronomi-cal learnings, Josephus “attributes the achievement not to Enoch but, instead, to thedescendants of Seth.” J. VanderKam,Enoch: A Man for All Generations(Columbia: Uni-versity of South Carolina,1995),153. H.S.J. Thackeray also notes the “Enochic role”in Josephus’ passage.

In1:73Josephus tells us that “many angels of Godnow consorted with women and beget sons who were overbearing anddisdainful of every virtue, such confidence had they in their strength;in fact the deeds that tradition ascribes to them resemble the auda-cious exploits told by the Greeks of the giants.”3J. VanderKam remarksthat the author ofJewish Antiquitiesdoes not connect this “Enochic-sounding” tale with the seventh patriarch; “rather, he makes Noahpreach to them—unsuccessfully.”4He further suggests that “it is notimpossible that Josephus took his information from a source such as1Enoch6–11, which mentions Noah but not Enoch.”5It appears that thesuggestions of scholars about the connection between the “two stelae”narrative and some Enochic materials are valid and deserve furtherinvestigation.Besides Josephus’ writings,6the two tablets/stelae tradition7appearsin many other sources, including the ArmenianHistory of the Forefathers3Josephus,Jewish Antiquities(LCL; tr.

Thepurpose of this chapter is to investigate these associations between the“two stelae” tradition and Enochic tradition.I.“Shadows” of the Enochic RolesJosephus’ account of the two stelae specifically credited the architectsof the antediluvian pillars (in Josephus’ case, the Sethites)9with the dis-covery of the science of astronomy. It was noted earlier that this refer-ence alludes to the seventh antediluvian patriarch, who, according totheAstronomical Book, first received such knowledge from the archangelUriel during his celestial tour. A closer look at Josephus’ passage andother textual evidence associated with the “two stelae” traditions showsthat the discovery of astronomy is not the only Enochic achievementthat appears to be borrowed in the variety of these stories. It seemsthat the employment of different Enochic roles is not a rare featureof these traditions. This section of our research will seek therefore touncover the hidden “shadows” of the Enochic roles that were implicitlypreserved in the various “two stelae” narratives.Brill,1996),151,198; idem, “Selections from ‘On the Creation of the World’ byYovhannes Tulkuranci,”Literature on Adam and Eve(eds.

In the two tablets’ story, in hisChronography1:5, he seemsto depend entirely on Josephus’ evidence.10However, his retelling helpsus to see some new angles in the familiar story. In his narration ofJosephus’ account, Malalas points to the foreknowledge of the futuredestruction of the world as an important characteristic of the authors ofthe antediluvian stelae.11He stresses that “Seth’s descendants were god-fearing men and, having foreknowledge of the destruction, or change,that was then to affect mankind, made two tablets, the one of stoneand the other of clay.”12Again, this motif of the foreknowledge of thefuture destruction of the earth returns us to some situations and rolesassociated with Enoch.In the Enochic traditions only a few prediluvian persons receivedrevelation about the upcoming destruction of the world. Among themEnoch and Noah can be found. Although Noah is informed about thefuture destruction of the world, the specific function of writing downthis revelation is usually assigned to Enoch, who in theBook of theWatchers,13Jubilees,14and in theBook of Giants,15is often portrayed as the10E.

An important detail in theseEnochic traditions relevant to the “two stelae” story (which entertainsthe idea about dual destruction of the world by water and fire), isthe fact that, in contrast to Noah who is informed about the Flood,Enoch, due to the specifics of his mediating affairs, also knows aboutthe upcoming destruction of the Watchers/Giants by fire.Art of WritingJosephus’ passage pictures the descendants of Seth as the ones whoinscribe astronomical discoveries on the pillars. It seems that the vari-ous “two stelae” stories seek to emphasize the scribal expertise of theSethites by attributing to them even the invention of writing.Although Josephus’ fragment does not say directly that the descen-dants of Seth invented writing, other “two stelae” accounts often doso. Thus, the ArmenianAbeldepicts Enosh as the one who inventedthe letters.16The anonymous chronicler included in the CSHB editionof John Malalas17and the LatinLife of Adam and Evealso point to theSethites’ invention of the art of writing by referring to Seth as to theone “who devised the caps of letters.”18Upon observing these references to the scribal activities of the vari-ous authors of the antediluvian stelae, one can easily recognize certainsimilarities to Enoch’s figure. As was noted earlier, he, similar to theSethites, was also involved in producing the antediluvian writings dedi-cated to the astronomical secrets.The excursus about the unique scribal functions of the seventh ante-diluvian patriarch in the Enochic traditions can begin with the pas-sage found in2Enoch22. It provides a striking picture of Enoch’s ini-tiation into the scribal activities which takes place near the Throne ofE.J.C.

Adler draws the reader’s attention to an interesting passage fromMichael Glycas which refers to Uriel’s instruction to Seth in a manner similar to Uriel’srevelation of the calendarical and astronomical secrets to Enoch in theAstronomical Bookof1Enoch. “It is said that the angel stationed among the stars, that is the divine Uriel,descended to Seth and then to Enoch and taught them the distinctions between hours,months, seasons, and years.” Adler,Time Immemorial: Archaic History and Its Sources inChristian Chronography from Julius Africanus to George Syncellus,105.

And letthem distribute the books in your handwritings, children to childrenand family to family and kinfolk to kinfolk... So I have commanded myangels, Ariukh and Pariukh, whom I have appointed to the earth as theirguardians, and I commanded the seasons, so they might preserve them[books] so they might not perish in the future flood which I shall createin your generation.24Despite the apparent “esoteric” character of the knowledge conveyedby the angels and the Lord to the seventh antediluvian patriarch, thedissemination of this information remains one of the major functionsof Enoch-Metatron in various Enochic traditions. They depict himas the one who shares astronomical, meteorological, calendarical, andeschatological knowledge with his sons and others during his short visitto the earth. He also delivers knowledge about future destruction to theWatchers/Giants. In the Merkabah tradition, Enoch-Metatron is alsoresponsible for transmitting the highest secrets to the Princes underhim, as well as to humankind. H. Kvanvig observes that “in Jewishtradition Enoch is primarily portrayed as a primeval sage,25the ultimaterevealer of divine secrets.”26Expertise in Astronomical and Calendar ScienceJosephus credited the authors of the antediluvian stelae with the dis-covery of astronomical and apparently calendarical knowledge, sincehis passage contains the reference to the science of the heavenly bod-ies and “their orderly array.”27Another “two stelae” text, drawn from23Josephus,Jewish Antiquities,4.33.24F.

Itreads that “the divine Uriel, descended to Seth and then to Enoch andtaught them the distinction between hours, months, seasons and years....”28The “two stelae” traditions also claimed that the Sethites gaveastronomical bodies their names. For example, the Armenian accountof two stelae found inAbelexplicitly supports this tradition by referringto Enosh, son of Seth, as the one who “called the planets by name.”29This tradition, with a reference to Josephus, is repeated in the Chroni-cle of John Malalas.30The account about the naming of the planets alsoappears in the anonymous chronicler included in the CSHB edition ofJohn Malalas.31In this text Seth is the one who called the planets byname. The account even refers to the specific Greek names, which Sethgave to the planets.The depictions of the Sethites’ achievements in astronomical scienceechoes traditional Enochic roles. Already in the early Enochic book-lets of1Enoch, Enoch is portrayed as the one who learned knowledgeabout the movements of the celestial bodies from the archangel Uriel.In theAstronomical Bookthe knowledge and revelation of cosmologi-cal and astronomical secrets become major functions of the elevatedEnoch. The origin of these roles in Enochic traditions can be tracedto1Enoch72:1,74:2,and80:1.In1Enoch41:1Enoch is depicted as theone who “saw all secrets of heaven...”32Jub.4:17also attests to thispeculiar role of the seventh patriarch. A large portion of2Enochis ded-icated to Enoch’s initiation into the treasures of meteorological, cal-endarical and astronomical lore during his celestial tour. Later Merk-abah developments also emphasize the role of Enoch as the “Knowerof Secrets.” According to3Enoch11:2, Enoch-Metatron is able to behold“deep secrets and wonderful mysteries.”3328Adler,Time Immemorial: Archaic History and Its Sources in Christian Chronography fromJulius Africanus to George Syncellus,105;Michaelis Glycae Annales(ed.

M. Stone, remarking on the passage fromAbel, observes that “thetradition connecting Seth with the invention of the names of the starsis unusual. It may be related to the more prevalent tradition attributingthe invention of both writings and astronomy to Enoch.”34In the distant past, R.H. Charles also noted that in the Byzan-tine chronicles many discoveries attributed to Seth reflect a transferof “Enoch’s greatness to Seth.”35In reference to Charles’ comments,W. Adler observes that the tradition attested in the “two stelae” narra-tive of Josephus and widespread in the Byzantine chronicles “becamethe basis for the attribution to Seth of numerous revelations and discov-eries, many of them precisely parallel to those imputed to Enoch.”36Preaching to the GiantsIt was observed earlier that in Josephus’ account the “two stelae” storyis attached to the Watchers/Giants narrative. The author ofJewishAntiquitiesportrays Noah’s unsuccessful preaching to the Giants. J. Van-derKam notes that “it is not impossible that Josephus took his infor-mation from a source such as1Enoch6–11, which mentions Noah butnot Enoch, although in those chapters Noah does not try to improvethe overbearing giants.”37Indeed, despite the fact that some traditionspoint to a possible close relationship between Noah and the Giantsin view of his miraculous birth,38his “experience” in dealing with theGiants in Enochic traditions cannot be even compared with Enoch’srecord. In various Enochic materials, Enoch is pictured as the specialenvoy of the Lord to the Watchers/Giants with a special, long-lastingmission to this rebellious group, both on earth and in other realms.TheBook of the Watchersdepicts him as the intercessor to the fallenangels.

Instead of Noah’s preaching to the Giants, they por-tray Enosh’s preaching to the sons of God. Two references about thepreaching to the sons of God in the “two stelae” traditions are espe-cially important. Both of them have been preserved in the Arme-nian language and include the ArmenianHistory of the ForefathersandAbel.The ArmenianHistory of the Forefathers40–44deals with the two stelaestory. In45the narrative continues with the description of Enosh’spreaching:40Sixth, because he [Enosh] set up two pillars against the sons of Cain,these are hope and good works, which they did not have.41Seventh, that he made writings and wrote on stela(e) of baked brick andbronze, and he prophesied that the earth will pass through water andfire on account of the sins of humans. And he cast the baked brick intothe water and the bronze into the fire, in order to test (them), if the firewas to come first, the bronze would melt, and if the water was to comefirst, the brick would be destroyed. And by this means he learned thatthe water was destined to come, and then fire. And these are a work ofhope.42And the writings on the two stelae told the names of all things, forhe knew that by lispers, stutterers and stammerers the language wasdestined to be corrupted.43And they confused and changed the names of the objects that had comeinto being, which Adam had named and fixed. On this account he wrote(them) on the two stelae and left them, so that if the water came firstand destroyed the pillar of baked brick, the bronze writing and names ofthings would remain, so that after the flood and the passing of times itmight come to use.39VanderKam,The Book of Jubilees,2.27–28.40See4Q2038.41Andersen,1.130–133."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"overshadowed by enoch’s greatness11944Likewise, also if the fiery flood42and the bronze (i.e., stele) melted andruined the writing, the earthen one might remain more baked.

Twohundred persons, having learned this from him, remembered the life ofparadise and established a covenant for themselves to live purely. Andthey were called “sons of God” on account of hope and of being busywith heavenly desire. For the glory of Christ, our hope.43The ArmenianAbelalso portrays Enosh as the author of the stelae.However, in contrast to the previous text, it connects the traditionabout the sons of God with Enoch and his antediluvian writings thatsurvived the Flood:4.3However, we found that Enosh, son of Seth, made the letter(s) and calledthe planets by name.4.4And he prophesied that this world would pass away twice, by water andby fire. And he made two stelae, of bronze and of clay, and he wroteupon them the names of the parts of creation which Adam had called.He said, “If it passes away by water, then the bronze (will) remain, and ifby fire, then the fired clay.”4.5And they were called true sons of God because God loved them, beforethey fornicated.4.6By this writing the vision of Enoch was preserved, he who was trans-ferred to immortality. And after the Flood, Arpachshad made Chaldeanwriting from it, and from the others (were made).44Several details in these two Armenian accounts about the preachingto the sons of God are important for establishing possible connectionswith Enochic traditions:1. Both texts use the terminology of “sons of God”;2.History of the Forefathersapplies this term to the audience of Enosh’spreaching;3.History of the Forefathersalso specifies the number of the sons of Godas two hundred persons;42b.

In the Bible the term can betraced to the Giants story in Gen6. Scholars, however, note that inlater Christian accounts the term “the sons of God” was often usedin reference to the Sethites.46They also note the peculiar tendencyto equate the Watchers and the Sethites in various accounts of the“two stelae” tradition.47It is quite possible that the authors of the twoArmenian accounts understand the sons of God to be the Sethites. Itis also evident that the prototype of the story was connected with theWatchers’ story and Enoch’s preaching to them. Several details in thetexts point to this connection. First,History of the Forefathers45definesthe number of “the sons of God” as two hundred. In the Enochictraditions this numeral appears often in reference to the number ofthe Watchers who descended on Mount Hermon.48Another importantfeature in the Armenian accounts is the description of the sons of Godas those whom God loves before they fornicated. It may allude to theexalted status of the Watchers and their leaders before their descent onMount Hermon.The important aspect of the preaching story found inHistory of theForefathers45involves the question why instead of Noah or Enoch thistext depicts Enosh as the one who preaches to the sons of God. It ispossible that Enoch’s name here was misplaced with that of Enosh.M. Stone observes that Enosh and Enoch are often confused in the45M. Stone observes that the Sethites are often called angels in some Greek patristicand Byzantine sources. Cf. M.E.

For he used to say: “If the earth isdestroyed by fire, the bricks will be preserved to be a reminder [for thosewho come after] of the mighty works of God which have happened fromthe beginning; and if the earth is destroyed by water, the marble tabletswill be preserved.” And Enoch used to warn the giants about manythings, but they remained stubborn and impenitent, nor did they wantto glorify the Creator, but instead each [of them] walked in his own willof the flesh...52A glance at thePalaeafragment shows that it is completely differentfrom the previous “two stelae” accounts based on Josephus’ story. Themain distinction is that Enoch, who in the Sethites’ accounts occupieda peripheral role, stays now in the center of his own authentic narrative.The fact that the preaching to the Giants preceded the writing of thestelae emphasizes that the focus of the story was changed and theproper order of the events was restored.This leads to important corrections. Unlike the Sethites in Josephus’account, Enoch does not try to preserve only one facet of the ante-diluvian knowledge, astronomical or calendar, but attempts to save thetotality of the celestial knowledge, as it was commanded to him bythe Lord in some Enochic accounts. Just as in2Enoch, he writes abouteverything that happened before him.In contrast to the Sethites’ account, thePalaeadoes not mention thename of Adam. In the Sethites’ “two stelae” stories, Adam serves as themediator of the divine revelation, through whom the Sethites receivethe knowledge about the future destruction of the earth. ThePalaeadoes not refer to the Adamic tradition, since Enoch and Noah, unlikethe Sethites, have direct revelation from God about the upcomingdestruction.These differences indicate that the author of the passage inPalaeaHistoricaseems to draw on traditions different from those representedin Josephus. It is also evident that the stories inPalaeaand Jose-52A.

The two tablets story is situated in themiddle of a large Noachic account which occupies three chapters inPalaea Historica.Unfortunately, in our presentation of thePalaeafragment, we were unable to reproducethis lengthy Noachic narrative.

The depiction takes place in the midst of the Noachic nar-rative where the theme of the Flood comes to the fore. The referenceto the tablets for the fire destruction therefore appears puzzling sincethe assurance of the approaching Flood makes them completely unnec-essary. Why does Enoch need the tablets made from the two types ofmaterial if it is already certain that the earth will perish inevitably inthe imminent Flood?The answer to these questions can possibly be found by referenceto theBook of Giants, where the theme of the Enochic tablets alsolooms large. Although the temporal locus of this narrative appears tobe placed before the approaching Flood, it seems to entertain the ideaof the dual destruction of the world, by water and by fire.One of the Qumran Aramaic fragments of theBook of Giants(4Q530)depicts a dream in which a giant sees the destruction of a certain “gar-den” by water and fire.58Most scholars take this symbolic dream to sig-nify the upcoming destruction of the world by water and fire. J. Reevesobserves that “the Qumran passage reflects an eschatological concep-tion59well attested in the Hellenistic era of a dual cosmic destruction,one of which employs water (mabbul shel mayim) and the other fire (mabbulshel\"esh).”60In their analysis of the dream about the destruction of the gar-den, scholars have tried to establish a connection between the materialfrom4Q530and the late Rabbinic text known as theMidrash of Shem-584Q530: “...Then two of them dreamed dreams, and the sleep of their eyes andcome to [...] their dreams. And he said in the assembly of [his frien]ds, the Nephilin,[...in] my dream; I have seen in this night [...] gardeners and they were watering [...]numerous roo[ts] issued from their trunk [...] I watched until tongues of fire from [...]all the water and the fire burned in all [...] Here is the end of the dream.” F.

Jubal, as well as the Sethites, knows about Adam’sprophecy. The reference to Adam in Jubal’s story might indicate thatthe main theological concern of the writers/editors of the “two stelae”accounts was not the prominent role of the Sethites, but rather Adam’sprophecy about the upcoming destruction of the earth. Here again thetraces of the Adamic tradition(s) are clearly observable.It was mentioned earlier that theBook of Giantsentertains the ideaof the dual destruction of the world, by water and fire. Althoughthe Bible and the Pseudepigrapha commonly refer to the Flood theyrarely use the image of the earth’s destruction by fire. It also appearsthat the Enochic Watchers/Giants account is one of the few placesin intertestamental Jewish literature where the necessity of such fireannihilation finds a consistent theological explanation. In spite of thefragmentary nature of the extant materials, they nevertheless are ableto demonstrate the complexity of the theme in theBook of Giants.It should be noted that the allusions to the future judgment by fireare not confined only to the Aramaic portions found at Qumran. Thefragments of theBook of Giantswhich have survived in other languagesgive additional details of this theme in the book.72They include severalnoted that “...in chapter26our compiler seems to have intercalated from the middleof paragraph15on to the end of20a tradition that occurs once before in chapter24,paragraph6–9, and which is missing in the Latin. It is not at all improbable that thisportion belongs to the old original.”The Chronicles of Jerahmeel,lxxv.69“...Jubal heard the prophecy of Adam concerning two judgments about to comeupon the world by means of the flood, the dispersion and fire, that he wrote down thescience of music upon two pillars, one of fine white marble and the other of brick, sothat in the event of the one melting and being destroyed by the waters, the other wouldbe saved.26:15–20.”The Chronicles of Jerahmeel,56.70“...and Enoch—who was the author of many writings—walked with God, andwas no more, for God had taken him away and placed him in the Garden of Eden,where he will remain until Elijah shall appear and restore the hearts of the fathers tothe children. And the Flood took place.”The Chronicles of Jerahmeel,57.71Another distinctive feature in Jubal’s story is that it refers to white marble as oneof the materials used for the stelae.

See: Milik,The Books of Enoch,318–320; Adler,Time Immemorial,179. Syncellus’ fragment describes the fire destructionof Mount Hermon, the prominent topos where the Watchers’ descent once took place.The text preserved in Syncellus reads: “...and again, concerning the mountain, onwhich they swore and bound themselves by oath, the one to the other, not to withdrawfrom it for all eternity: There will be descend on it neither cold, nor snow, nor frost, nordew, unless they descend on it in malediction, until the day of the Great Judgment.At that time it will be burned and brought low, it will be consumed and melteddown, like wax by fire. Thus it will be burned as a result of all its works...” Milik,The Books of Enoch,318. For the critical edition of the text see: Georgius Syncellus,Ecloga Chronographica(ed. A.A. Mosshammer; Bibliotheca Scriptorum Graecorum etRomanorum Teubneriana; Leipzig: Teubner,1984),26–27. The story of fire destructionof Mount Hermon in Syncellus echoes1Enoch10:13–16, where God tells Michael thatHe has prepared the destruction by fire for the Watchers.73The first group of fragments is connected with the final fire punishment of“sinners” (in Henning’s opinion, “sinners” represent the Watchers and the Giants)under the eyes of the Righteous. Henning believes that this group of texts belongedto the Kawân. F—“(Col. D) ...sinners...is visible, where out of this fire your soul will beprepared (for the transfer) to eternal ruin (?).

They include a Parthian fragment about the GreatFire and a Coptic fragment from Manichaean Psalm book where the name of Enoch ismentioned: N—“And the story about the Great Fire: like unto (the way in which) theFire, with powerful wrath, swallows this world and enjoys it...;” Q—“The Righteouswho were burnt in the fire, they endured.

It is important, however, to emphasize several featuresof this theme relevant to the subject of our investigation:1. It is clear that the story of the tablets represents a major theme inthe originalBook of Giants. In a relatively small amount of the extantQumran materials of theBook of Giants,thecontextualreference to thetablet(s) occurs six times in three fragments:2Q26;744Q2037BII,75and4Q2038.76The tablets are also mentioned in the Sundermann fragmentof the ManichaeanBook of Giants77and in theMidrash of Shemhazai andAzael.782. Several fragments of theBook of Giantsrefer totwotablets. The twotablets are addressed in4Q2037BII and4Q2038. This number oftablets also occurs in the Middle Persian fragment of theBook of Giantspublished by W. Sundermann.793. The extant materials ascribe the authorship of the tablets to Enoch.4Q2038refers to a “copy of the seco[n]d tablet of [the] le[tter...] bythe hand of Enoch, the distinguished scribe...”80Enoch is described asthe distinguished scribe. He is also portrayed as the one who copied thetablets, since the reference to a “copy of the seco[n]d tablet” in4Q2038:3–4occurs in conjunction with his name.742Q26“[...and] they washed the tablet to er[ase...] [...] and the water rose abovethe [tab]let [...] [...] and they lifted the tablet from the water, the tablet which [...] [...]...[...] to them all [...].” F.

The reference to Enoch’s copying of the tablet is quite intriguing,since “copying” plays a decisive role in the various two tablets/stelaematerials mentioned in our research earlier, which are construedaround the idea of the duplication of the tablets in various materials.5. In conclusion to this section, it should be noted that theBook of Giants’materials seem to contain traces of a more developed and multifacetedtradition about the tablets than the later “two tablets” accounts. In theBook of Giantscopying is only one of the several roles Enoch has inrelation to the tablets. In this text the theme of tablets seems closelyconnected with other traditional roles of the elevated Enoch such asthose of Mediator81and the Witness of the Divine Judgment.82TheseEnochic roles are reflected in the peculiar functions of the tablets intheBook of Giants. The tablets serve as a record of accusations againstthe Watchers/Giants, representing the written account of their sins.83The tablets are also a mediating tool in the dialogue between God andthe Watchers/Giants via the representatives of the both parties—Enochand Mahaway.84These peculiar functions are only slightly hinted at inlater tablet traditions.85The later “two tablets” traditions seem primar-ily preoccupied with the idea of copying, where the tablets are por-trayed as the specific means for the preservation of knowledge in theimpending catastrophe. They therefore appear to represent only onefacet of the complicated story of the Enochic tablets.81The “mediating” function of Enoch remains prominent during the whole historyof the Enochic traditions. It has been shown previously that in1Enochand2Enoch,the seventh antediluvian patriarch “transmits” celestial knowledge to various humanand angelic agents. In the Merkabah tradition, Metatron/Enoch is also responsible fortransmitting the highest secrets to the Princes under him and to humankind.82On Enoch’s roles see A. Orlov, “Titles of Enoch-Metatron in2Enoch,”JSP18(1998)71–86.83Cf.4Q2038:6–15and possibly2Q26. Apparently the last one pictures an attemptto erase (wash out) this record of iniquities:2Q26“[...and] they washed the tablet toer[ase...] and the water rose above the [tab]let [...] and they lifted the tablet from thewater, the tablet which [...] to them all [...].” F.

The first part of our research deals with the “two stelae” stories basedon the Josephus account. Our analysis of these accounts shows thatthey contain traces of the Enochic traditions. It appears that these “twostelae” stories interact with the Enochic traditions by way of attributingvarious Enochic roles to the alleged “authors” of the antediluvianstelae. These “authors” are usually portrayed as the Sethites. Theattribution involves substantial rewriting of the original Enochic motifsand themes. The analysis also shows that the interaction of “two stelae”stories with Enochic traditions seems to involve some details of theWatchers/Giants’ story.2. The passage found inJewish Antiquitiesand the stories which arebased on this account demonstrate the influence of the Adamic tra-dition(s). In these accounts Adam’s prophecy about the upcoming de-struction of the earth serves as the reason for the making of the ante-diluvian stelae.3. It is also possible that despite the decisive formative influence Jose-phus’ account had on the subsequent “two stelae” stories, it itself rep-resents the Adamic revision of the original two stelae/tablets accountbased on Noachic/Enochic traditions. Noah’s preaching to the Giantsin Josephus’ account, the host of Enochic roles, and remnants of theWatchers/Giants story in various “two stelae” narratives may point tothe Noachic/Enochic prototype.4. It is possible that the Noachic/Enochic prototext was dedicated nei-ther to the Sethites nor the Cananites who followed Adam’s instruc-tions, but rather to Enoch and Noah.5. The tradition preserved inPalaea Historicamight directly derive fromthis Noachic/Enochic original, which has not undergone Adamic revi-sions.6. It is possible that some “two stelae” accounts might be connectedwith, or maybe even derived from, traditions similar to theBook ofGiants. The circulating of materials related to theBook of Giantstradi-tions in medieval Christian milieux does not seem impossible. W. Adlerobserves that some passages found in Syncellus “imply the existence of"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"overshadowed by enoch’s greatness131some work circulating in the name of the Giants.”86He also demon-strates that such references sometimes occur in connection with the twostelae/tablets traditions.877. In an attempt to find possible antecedents for the two tablets story inthe known Noachic/Enochic materials the tablet tradition(s) preservedin theBook of Giantsfragments were explored.8. While our comparative analysis of the “two stelae” traditions withmaterials from theBook of Giantsrevealed some suggestive similarities, itis evident that the extremely fragmentary character of the extant mate-rials from theBook of Giantscannot give us definite evidence about thepresence of the two stelae/tablets tradition in the original document.86Adler,Time Immemorial: Archaic History and Its Sources in Christian Chronography fromJulius Africanus to George Syncellus,91,n.68.87Cf.

In these chapters, one findsmany promises that Enoch will “stand in front of the face of the Lordforever.”9In terms of the theological background of the problem, the titleseems connected with the image of Metatron in the Merkabah tradi-tion,10which was “crystallized in the classical Hekhalot literature.”11According to the legend of the Hekhalot tradition, Enoch “was raisedto the rank of first of the angels and\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007\b(literally, ‘prince ofthe divine face’, or ‘divine presence’).”123Enoch, as well as other textsof the tradition, have a well-developed theology connected with thistitle.The Knower of SecretsThe Merkabah tradition emphasizes the role of Metatron as the“Knower of Secrets,”\u0002\u0003\t\u0007\u000b\f\u0003.13According to3Enochhe is “wise inthe secrets and Master of the mysteries.”14He is the one who receivedthese secrets from the angels and from the Lord (the Holy One). Heserves also as “the Revealer of Secrets,” the one who is responsible forthe transmission of the highest secrets to the Princes under him, as wellas to humankind. In ch.38of3Enoch, Metatron told R. Ishmael that hewas the person who revealed secrets to Moses, in spite of the protests ofheavenly hosts:7stani pred licem] moim[ vo býky.8Odeberg,3Enoch,1.55.9Cf.21:3;21:5;22:6;22:7.10Scholem,Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism,67.11About different stages in Hekhalot tradition, see Gruenwald,Apocalyptic and Merka-vah Mysticism,67;98–123.12Scholem,Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism,67.13The origin of the role in Enochic traditions can be traced to1Enoch72:1;74:2and80:1.Seealso41:1, “And after this I saw all secrets of heaven.” M.

Why do you reveal this toflesh and blood?15According to this theological material, Enoch (Metatron) is responsiblefor transmitting the secrets of the Written Torah as well as the OralTradition. “And Metatron brought them out from his house of trea-suries and committed them to Moses, and Moses to Joshua, and Joshuato the elders, and the elders to the prophets and the prophets to themen of the Great Synagogue... .”16In later Merkabah materials, Enoch-Metatron is the guide and therevealer of secrets to all who are initiated into the account of the Char-iot.17Hekhalot literature (3Enoch,theShi#ur Qomahmaterials) describesthese functions of Metatron. He guides and reveals secrets to R. Ish-mael and to R. Akiba. Sometimes the Merkabah narrative extends hisrole to the titles of the Prince of Wisdom and the Prince of Understand-ing.18It is apparent that in2Enochone may see some kind of preparationof Enoch for his role as Metatron, “the Knower of Secrets.” Thepreparation entails several stages. First, the archangel Vereveil inductsEnoch into these secrets. He instructs Enoch in “all the deeds of theLord, the earth and the sea, and all the elements and the courses...andthe Hebrew language, every kind of language of the new song of thearmed troops and everything that it is appropriate to learn” (23:1–2). Second, the Lord himself continues to instruct him in the secrets,which he had not even explained to the angels (24:3). Finally, the Lordpromised Enoch the role of “Knower of Secrets.” The important detailhere is that the promise of the role is closely connected with other titlesof Metatron such as the Prince of Presence, the Heavenly Scribe, andthe Witness of the Judgment. In the text the Lord promised:15Odeberg,3Enoch,2.177–178.16Odeberg,3Enoch,2.178.17Metatron himself was the Merkabah mysticpar excellenceand a good example forYorde Merkabah. As Alexander notes, it is not hard to see why he attracted mystics. “Hewas a human being who had been elevated over all the angels, and was living proofthat man could overcome angelic opposition and approach God. He was a powerful‘friend at court.’” Alexander, “3Enoch,”OTP,1.244.18Odeberg,3Enoch,2.30."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"138the enoch tradition...and you will be in front of my face from now and forever.19And youwill be seeing my secrets20and you will be scribe for my servants21sinceyou will be writing down everything that has happened on earth and thatexists on earth and in the heavens, and you will be for me a witness ofthe judgment22of the great age (36:3).This substantial passage graphically depicts the interrelation of thefuture roles of Enoch-Metatron in the narrative of2Enoch. In spite ofthe fact that the text does not elaborate the real embodiments of theseroles and titles, but only promises and initiations in these roles, it leavesthe impression that2Enochis part of larger tradition and that its authorhas prior knowledge of the future development of these titles and thedeeds behind them.It is intriguing that the narrative of2Enochdoes not show the prom-ised powerful deeds of Enoch-Metatron in different offices of the heav-enly realm, for example, those of the Knower, the Scribe, the Wit-ness and the Prince of Presence even in early “primitive” Merkabahor apocalyptic form. It looks as if the author of the text deliberatelyavoids these details. He knows that it is not time for revealing thesefacts. Enoch must return to the earth, and only after that trip he willfully assume his heavenly offices. In67:2, which serves as the conclu-sion to Enoch’s story, there is a statement about the theme: “and theLord received him and made him stand in front of his face for eter-nity.”23In this regard, the narratives of2Enochand3Enochseem to be writtenfrom different temporal perspectives. The setting of Enoch’s story in2Enochis the antediluvian period. Melchizedek’s narrative of the bookdistinctively stresses this point. This explains why in2Enoch“there is noplace for Abraham, Moses, and the rest.”2419“The Prince of Presence.”20“The Knower of Secrets.”21“The Heavenly Scribe.”22“The Witness of the Divine Judgment.”23Andersen, “2Enoch,”195.24Andersen, “2Enoch,”196."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"titles of enoch-metatron in2(slavonic)enoch139The Heavenly ScribeOdeberg notices that Enoch’s initiation into the Secrets (and his title—the Knower of Secrets) is closely connected with his scribal activi-ties25and with his other title—“the Scribe”26(\u0007\u0005\f\r) or “the HeavenlyScribe.”27The steps in the development of this theme in2Enochareapparent. Enoch’s scribal functions have several aspects:1. He was initiated into the scribal activities by the Lord himself.“And the Lord said to Vereveil, ‘Bring out the books from thestorehouses, and give a pen to Enoch28andreadhimthebooks.’And Vereveil...gave me the pen29from his hand” (22:11).302. He writes down the mysteries which were explained to him byangels. In23:4angel Vereveil commands him: “Write everythingthat I have explained to you.”313. The results of his scribal activity were a certain number of books.“I wrote accurately. And I expounded300and60books” (23:6).324. The Lord instructed Enoch to deliver these books in his handwrit-ing to his sons,33and to distribute the books in his handwriting tohis children ... for they will read them from generation to genera-tion (33:8–10).25In early Enochic traditions these two functions are also unified. The motif ofinitiation into the secrets as the beginning of scribal activities occupies a substantial rolein the Astronomical Book of1Enoch, the oldest Enochic material. In1Enoch74:2Enochwrites the instructions of the angel Uriel regarding the secrects of heavenly bodies andtheir movements. Knibb,The Ethiopic Book of Enoch,2.173.QumranEnochicfragments(4QEnGiants14;4QEn92:1) picture Enoch as “the scribe of distinction”\u000e\b\u0007\u0005\u0007\u0005\r.Cf.Milik,The Book of Enoch,261–262and305. In the book ofJubileesEnoch is attested as“the first who learned writings and knowledge and wisdom... And who wrote in thebook the signs of the heaven.” O.S. Wintermute, “Jubilees,”OTP,2.62.26The origin of the title in Enochic traditions can be traced to theBook of the Watchersof1Enoch12:4,15:1, where Enoch is named as “a scribe of rightousness.” Knibb,TheEthiopic Book of Enoch,2.92and100. According to Black the possible biblical parallel toEnoch’s role as the Scribe could be the passage from Ezek.9, which pictures man cladin white linen with an ink-horn by his side.

The Lord appointed the guardian angels for Enoch’s writings:For I will give you an intercessor, Enoch, my archistratig, Michael, onaccount of your handwritings and the handwritings of your fathers—Adam and Seth. They will not be destroyed until the final age. For I havecommanded my angels Arioch and Marioch, whom I have appointedon the earth to guard them and to command the things of time topreserve the handwritings of your fathers so that they might not perishin the impending flood which I will create in your generation (33:10–12.)34The motif of guardian angels of the books is very specific for theesoterism of Merkabah tradition.35This motif can be found in3Enochas well as in other texts of the tradition.6. Finally the Lord gave the promise to Enoch about his futurerole as the Heavenly Scribe when he will return to heaven afterthe instructions of his sons, “...and you will be the scribe36formy servants, since you will be writing down everything that hashappened on earth and that exists on earth and in the heavens,and you will be for me a witness of the judgment of the great age”(36:3).37Finally, it is worth examining an interesting detail that is relevant asa characteristic of a hypothetical provenance, but which has remainedunnoticed by scholars. In23:4, when Enoch was already in the highestrealms, Vereveil gave him permission to sit down.38“You sit down;write everything... .” And Enoch said, “And I sat down39for a secondperiod of30days and30nights, and I wrote accurately” (23:6).40It34Andersen, “2Enoch,”157.35Alexander notes that “classic rabbinical literature makes it clear that there wasan esoteric doctrine in Talmudic Judaism. It was concerned with two subjects—theAccount of Creation (Ma#aseh Bereˇsit) and the Account of the Chariot (Ma#aseh Merkabah).All study and discussion of these topics in public was banned.” Alexander, “3Enoch,”229–230.36kniænik.37It is an important moment for understanding of the presence of Merkabah tra-dition in the text of2Enoch: the functions of Enoch as the Scribe will be connectedwith his role as the Witness of the Divine Judgment: “Metatron sits and judges theheavenly household” or “Metatron, the angel of the Presence, stands at the door of thePalace of God and he sits and judges all the heavenly hosts before his Master. And Godpronounces judgment and he executes it.” Odeberg,3Enoch,2.171.38s0di.39sýdoh.40Andersen, “2Enoch,”141."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"titles of enoch-metatron in2(slavonic)enoch141is important to notice that Vereveil’s suggestion that Enoch be seatedoccurs after Enoch has been “brought in front of the face of the Lord”(22:6), and after he has been invited by the Lord “to stand in front ofhis face forever” (22.6–7). According to rabbinic tradition, “there is nositting in heaven.”41An allegorical description, which can be found in3Enoch, depicts God as the one who places Metatron on a throne at thedoor of the Seventh Hall.42In his commentary on this section of3Enoch,Odeberg states that “assigning a seat or a throne to any angel-prince orto any one beside the Holy One, might endanger the recognition ofthe absolute sovereignty and unity of the Godhead.”43Furthermore, hereasoned that according to rabbinic tradition the privilege of “sitting”was accorded to Metatron by virtue of his character as “scribe,” for hewas granted permission as a scribe “to sit and write down the meritsof Israel.”44This fact, that Enoch was seated in the text of2Enoch,isone more compelling example that further strengthens the hypothesisregarding the connection of the text of2Enochwith the Merkabahtradition.The YouthPrevious research has shown that the descriptions of the celestial titlesin2Enochoccupy some sort of intermediate position between earlyEnochic traditions and the Metatron tradition. Therefore, some latertitles of Metatron, which are absent in1Enoch, Jubileesand Qumranmaterials are presented in the narrative of2Enoch. A good illustrationof this situation could be the observation of another celestial title ofEnoch-Metatron which can be found in2Enoch,namely—Na#ar\u0007\u0004,which can be translated as the Youth or the Lad.45According to Jewish mystical lore, this title could be considered as“proof ” of the theological assumption that Metatron is the translatedEnoch ben Yared. The tradition derives this title from the exegesis of41b.Hag.15a.423En.10.43Odeberg,3Enoch,2.27.44Odeberg,3Enoch,2.27.45According to Tishby it is the most popular title of Metatron. “Metatron is knownby many names and titles, but his regular designation, found even in the earlierliterature, is\u0007\u0004,na#ar—“boy,” or “lad.” I.

According to one of them, the name may beexplained by the fact that Metatron grows old, and is then constantlyrejuvenated.47Another possible explanation is that he is young in com-parison with other angels-princes who existed from the beginning.48Itis notable, that the several important occurrences of the title “Youth” inthe text of2Enochcome from the mouths of angels. In chapter9of theshort recension an angelic being, who is accompanying Enoch on hisway through the heavenly realm, addresses Enoch as “Youth”: “Thisplace has been prepared, Youth (þnoøe), for the righteous... .49Laterin chapter10we can hear the same address again: “This place, Youth(þnoøe), has been prepared for those who practice godless uncleannesson the earth...”50These occurrences could be considered by someonesimply as reminders for Enoch about his novice status in the heav-enly realm. This, however, is not the case with the Merkabah tradi-tion, whereNa#aralso designates special relationships between the HolyOne and Metatron. In3Enochwhen R. Ishmael asks Metatron “Whatis your name?” Metatron answers, “I have seventy names, correspond-ing to the seventy tongues of the world... but my King calls me ‘Youth’(Na#ar).”51Interestingly enough, we can see the beginning of this tra-dition in the text of2Enoch. In chapter24of the short recension52weread: “And the Lord called me (Enoch) and he placed me to himselfcloser than Gabriel. And the Lord spoke to me ‘Whatever you see,Yo u t h (þnoøe), things standing still and moving about were broughtto perfection by me. And not even to my angels have I explained mysecrets... as I am making them known to you today.’”53As we can see46Odebert,3Enoch,1.119.47Tishby,The Wisdom of the Zohar,2.628: “it is the mystery of the boy who reachesold age and then reverts to his youth as at the beginning.”48Odebert,3Enoch,1.80.49Barsov’s manuscript [B], ch.

Perhaps the most mysterious thing connected withthis title is the fact that prominent scholars of Jewish mystical litera-ture like Scholem and Odeberg do not find the important title in thenarrative of2Enoch. One possible explanation may be that Vaillant didnot pay enough attention to the variants of the reading of the term“Youth” in his edition, considering this reading as a “corruption,”54andconsequently dedicating just a few sentences to this fact. According toVaillant this “corruption” occurred because the Slavonic wordEnoøe,the vocative form of “Enoch,” is very similar to “Youth,”þnoøe.55This probably explains why those scholars who based their researchon Vaillant’s text also missed this vital point. Only the new collationof manuscripts for Andersen’s translation again drew attention to thisvariant. Andersen gives a short concluding note on the term “Youth”that “It cannot be a coincidence that this title is identical with that ofEnoch (= Metatron) in3Enoch.”56The Governor of the WorldThe Merkabah tradition stresses the role of Metatron as “governingpower over the nations, kingdoms and rulers on earth.”57Chapter30of3Enochpictures Metatron as the Prince of the World\u0002\u000f\f\u0006\u0007\b,theleader of seventy-two princes of the kingdom of the world, who speakspravednogo: Teksty, latinskij perevod i izsledovanie,”Chtenija v obshchestve istorii i drevnostejRossiiskih4(1910),90–91.54Andersen criticizes Valliant’s position.

My previ-ous observations about the celestial titles of Enoch showed that thesedescriptions are situated in chapters21–38. These early chapters unfoldEnoch’s transformation from a human being into an angel in the high-est celestial realms near the Throne of Glory.In chapters39–67, Enoch gives some instructions to his childrenduring his brief visit to the earth. The text makes clear that during thisvisit Enoch is already an angelic being. In chapter56of2Enochhe saysto his son: “Listen, my child! Since the time when the Lord anointedme with the ointment of my glory, it has been horrible for me, andfood is not agreeable to me, and I have no desire for earthly food.”66This portrayal of Enoch as angelic being in this section of the book isvery important, because it allows us to see traces of another traditionin the text of2Enoch. It is possible that in this part of the book we havesome remnants of developed Metatron tradition. Chapters39–67differslightly from chapters21–38in the ways the picture Enoch’s role in thecelestial realm.First, the later chapters (43–44) give an important description ofEnoch as the Governor (Prince) of the world, a role which in lateMerkabah literature usually is connected with Metatron tradition.men in their generations until the day of judgment. He saw and knew everything andwrote his testimony and deposited the testimony upon the earth against all the childrenof men and their generation ... And he wrote everything, and bore witness to theWatchers .... And Enoch bore witness against all of them ...

There is no other Slavonic text where the wordprometayais documented. Phonetically close to the term “Metatron,”prometayacould represent a very early, rudimentary form of the name whichlater was transformed into the term “metatron.”68It is noteworthythat we cannot find the term in the early chapters connected with thedescriptions of other celestial titles.Third, at the beginning of this textual block (chapter40)wehavethefollowing words of Enoch: “Now therefore, my children, I know every-thing; some from the lips of the Lord, other my eyes have seen fromthe beginning to the end, and from the end to the recommencement.”69This statement does not fit with previous descriptions of Enoch’s initi-ations which were restricted by fixed temporal boundaries (angel Vere-veil instructions for30days and30nights, and so on). Later, in ch.50,Enoch says that the already “put into writing the achievements of everyperson, and no one can escape.”70As we recall in his deeds as the Gov-ernor of the earth he already “arranged the whole year” and he “hasdistinguished every seed on the earth, and every measure and everyrighteous scale” (43:1). This unlimited horizon of functions and deedsof Enoch is not consistent with the previous narrative of chapters21–38. It is apparent that we have two different traditions which sometimesdemonstrate the lack of linkage and reconciliation.Finally, we must keep in mind the fact which radically differen-tiates2Enoch’sstory from other stories of early Enochic documents(like1Enoch,Jubileesor Enochic Qumran fragments). The importanttheological watershed of the Enochic and Metatron traditions in thebook is the allegorical description of the extraction of Enoch fromhis “earthly clothing” and the placement of him into the “clothes ofGlory.”71In2Enoch22, after the archangel Michael extracted Enoch67“And behold my children, I am the Governor of the earth, [prometaya], I wrotethem down ...”68I investigated the relationships between the wordsprometayaandMetatroninmyarticle “The Origin of the Name ‘Metatron’ and the Text of2(Slavonic Apocalypse of)Enoch,”JSP21(2000)19–26.69Andersen, “2Enoch,”165.70Andersen, “2Enoch,”177.71A possible parallel to this theme could be1En.71where Enoch “was born torighteousness.” The text describes the situation when Enoch went through some sortof “transformation” when his whole body was “melted” and his spirit was transformed."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"titles of enoch-metatron in2(slavonic)enoch147from his clothes and anointed him with the delightful oil which was“greater than the greatest light,”72Enoch becomes like “one of the glo-rious ones, and there was no observable difference.”73This symbolicevent of angelic74transmutation75apparently represents in many waysan important turning point in which the Enochic tradition has movedinto a new era of its development—the Metatron tradition.76ConclusionAs I have already mentioned, the most impressive alignments between2Enochand Merkabah tradition are dependent upon developing thethemes connected with the Celestial Titles of Enoch (Metatron). Theygive new evidence that the Metatron tradition has deep connectionswith early Enochic literature.77As we know, the process of the hidden theological transformation,when one name (“Enoch”) suddenly becomes transformed into anothername (“Metatron”), does not demonstrate the continuity of the textualtradition. On the contrary, a gap exists between the early Enochicliterature (I Enoch, Jubilees, Enochic Qumran materials,2Enoch)andtheKnibb,The Ethiopic Book of Enoch,2.166–167. However radical difference of this transfor-mation from the similar event in2EnochisthefactthattransformedEnochin1Enochdoes not belong to the archangelic rank of “glorious ones” to which Metatron belongs.The text is silent about any sign of angelic transmutation.72Andersen, “2Enoch,”139.73Andersen, “2Enoch,”139.74J.H. Charlesworth rightly observes on this episode that “it is conceivable that hereEnoch—although he is not explicitly called ‘an angel’—has attained the rank of anangel or been transformed into angel. The possibility looms large since in2Enoch21.3Gabriel is identified as one of the Lord’s glorious ones.” James H. Charlesworth, “ThePortrayal of the Righteous as an Angel,” in: J.J.

In the Slavonic apocalypse, Enoch describes to his childrenthe gigantic hand of the Lord which fills the heaven.

More-over, some of these accounts seem to depict Metatron as the measure ofthe Divine Body.Scholem’s comments about the significance of2Enoch39for thehistory of early Jewish mysticism are important. His analysis, however,is incomplete since it focuses only on theShi#ur Qomahpassage foundin chapter39. It does not explore the broader context of the passage,especially its relation to other descriptions of Enoch in the Slavonicapocalypse that seem to recall the depictions of Metatron in theShi#urQomahmaterials. Moreover, it appears that the traditions about thedivine body are not limited in this text to the figure of Enoch andinclude another important character of the text, namely, the patriarchAdam. The portrayal of the prelapsarian Adam found in the longerrecension of2Enochreveals fascinating similarities to the laterShi#urQomahdescriptions. Keeping in mind these important features of theSlavonic apocalypse, this study will investigate the roles of Adam andEnoch in the broader context of theShi#ur Qomahaccount found in2Enoch.Adamic Tradition of2EnochBefore proceeding to an investigation of the traditions about the divinebody found in the Slavonic apocalypse, a short excursus into the Adam-ic narrative of2Enochis necessary. This narrative appears partly to beresponsible for creating the polemical context in which the divine bodytraditions in the text are introduced and discussed.Adam’s story occupies a significant place in2Slavonic Enoch.Ac-counts of the protoplast’s creation and his fall can be found in allthree major sections of the book.10The text depicts Adam as a glori-ous angelic being, predestined by God to be the ruler of the earth, butfalling short of God’s expectations. Although a large part of the Adamicmaterials belongs to the longer recension, a number of important pas-sages related to this tradition are also attested in the shorter recension.The presence of Adamic materials in both recensions and the signifi-102Enoch30:8–32:2;33:10;41:1;42:5;44:1;58:1–3;71:28."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"152the enoch traditioncance of the Adamic narrative for the whole theological framework ofthe Slavonic apocalypse lead the interpreter to conclude that they arenot later interpolations, but belong to the original layer of the text.It should be noted that such an extensive presence of Adamic mate-rials in the early Enochic text is quite unusual. For instance, in theEnochic books, included in1(Ethiopic) Enoch, Adamic traditions are notaccentuated and are limited to a few insignificant remarks.11Moreover,Adam’s image in1Enochis quite different from the one attested in theSlavonic Apocalypse.1Enoch’smaterials do not provide any informationabout the elevated status of the protoplast.The modest role which Adam plays in the early Enochic books canbe explained by the fact that Enochic and Adamic traditions often con-tend with each other in offering different explanations of the originof evil12in the world.13From the point of view of this rivalry betweenAdamic and Enochic traditions, it might appear that the concentratedpresence of Adamic materials in2Enochrepresents alien accretionsinterpolated into the original narrative much later during its long trans-mission in the Christian environment. A closer examination of thetext, however, reveals that the presence of the Adamic tradition inthe Slavonic apocalypse is neither secondary nor coincidental but hasa profound conceptual value for the overall theology of the pseude-pigraphon. It appears that the purpose of the extensive presence ofAdamic materials in2Enochcan be explained through the assessmentof Enoch’s image in the text.Scholars have previously noted that Enoch’s figure, portrayed in thevarious sections of2Enoch, is more developed than in the early Enochictractates of1Enoch. For the first time, the Enochic tradition tries toportray the patriarch, not simply as a human taken to heaven andtransformed into an angel, but as a celestial being exalted above theangelic world. In this attempt, one may find the origin of anotherimage of Enoch (very different from the early Enochic literature) which11See,1Enoch32:6;37:1;60:8;69:9–11;85:3;90:37–38.12The Enochic tradition bases its understanding of the origin of evil on the Watch-ers story where the fallen angels corrupt human beings by passing on to them variouscelestial secrets. In contrast, the Adamic tradition traces the source of evil to Satan’sdisobedience and the transgression of Adam and Eve in Eden.13M.

One of these transferences includes thetradition of Adam’s cosmic body that seems to play a formative role increating such new identities of Enoch as themeasureand themeasurerofthe divine body in the Slavonic apocalypse.14Philip Alexander observes that “the transformation of Enoch in2Enoch22pro-vides the closest approximation, outside Merkabah literature, to Enoch’s transformationin3Enoch3–13.” Alexander, “3Enoch,”248.15In1987Moshe Idel published an article in which he explored the role of theAdamic traditions in shaping the image of Enoch as the supreme angel Metatron.Although Idel’s research deals mainly with later rabbinic materials, it demonstratesthat already in some pseudepigraphic accounts Enoch appears to be portrayed as aluminous counterpart of Adam who regained Adam’s glory, which was lost during theprotoplast’s transgression. Idel suggests that Enoch’s luminous metamorphosis attestedin2Enoch22might also belong to the same tradition which views Enoch as theone who regained Adam’s lost status and luminosity. He observes that to the bestof his knowledge “Enoch is the only living person for whom we learn that luminousgarments, reminiscent of Adam’s lost garments of light, were made.” M. Idel, “Enochis Metatron,”Immanuel24/25(1990),220–240. Alexander, in his recent research, addsnew insight to Idel’s argument about the formative value of the Adamic traditions forthe image of the elevated Enoch. Alexander points to a number of rabbinic passagesin which the “supernatural radiance” of Adam’s heavenly soul, which departed fromhim when he sinned, then returned to be reincarnated in Enoch. He further observesthat “behind these passages is a concept of Metatron as a divine entity first incarnatein Adam and then reincarnate in Enoch. Enoch, having perfected himself, in contrastto Adam, who sinned and fell, re-ascends to his heavenly home and takes his rightfulplace in the heights of the universe, above the highest angels.... Enoch thus becomesa redeemer figure—a second Adam through whom humanity is restored.” Alexander,“From Son of Adam to a Second God,”111.16Christfried Böttrich, in his recent bookAdam als Microkosmos(Judentum und Um-welt,59; Berlin: Peter Lang,1995), attempted to investigate the Adamic traditionsabout the protoplast’s creation out of the seven components and the correspondenceof his name with the four corners of the world found in2Enoch30.

According to this text, dur-ing this celestial metamorphosis Enoch-Metatron “was enlarged andincreased in size till [he] matched the world in length and breadth.”18The materials associated with theShi#ur Qomahtradition19also describeEnoch-Metatron in similar terms, telling that “the stature of this youthfills the world20(\u0002\u000f\f\u0006\u000e\u000f\u0012\f\u0013\u0012\f\u0014\u0006\t\u0006\u0007\u0004\u0006\f).”21Despite the prominent place that the traditions about the cosmicbody of Enoch-Metatron occupy in the later Merkabah accounts, theearly Enochic materials of the Second Temple period are silent aboutthe great dimensions of the body of the elevated patriarch.

In con-trast to this silence about Enoch’s corporeality, several early Jewishsources attest to the lore about the enormous body of another Biblicalcharacter, the patriarch Adam, which the protoplast possessed beforehis transgression in Eden.

And I saw there a man very great in height and terrible inbreadth, incomparable in aspect, entwined with a woman was also equalto the man in aspect and size.

Thus, in several pseudepi-graphical materials the depictions of Adam’s stature are often linked tothe imagery of the enthroned divine anthropomorphic extent knownfrom the priestly and Ezekelian sources as God’sKavod. One such asso-ciation might be hinted at in2Enoch30;heretheKavodimagery seemsto have been applied to Adam’s prelapsarian condition. In this text theprotoplast is labeled as “the second angel” to whom the Lord assignedfour special stars. Jarl Fossum suggests24that, in view of the imageryattested in another Enochic texts where stars often designate angels, theallotment to Adam of the “four special stars” might allude to the factthat Adam, like God, also has his own “Princes of the Presence”—thefour angels whose function is to serve near the Throne of Glory. Thisangelic imagery signals that2Enoch’s authors might understand Adamas an enthroned entity resembling the Lord’s glorious anthropomorphicextent, hisKavod.25TheTestament of Abraham11:4(Recension A) also attests to a similartradition when it offers a depiction of “the first-formed Adam” seatedon the throne at the entrance to paradise at the end of time: “Andoutside the two gates of that place, they saw a man seated on thegolden throne.

Thus, theApocryphon of Johnrelates a traditionaccording to which the seven powers were responsible for the creationof the seven souls of Adam.31The text relates that the seven powersprovided for the angels the seven substances of the soul in order tocreate the proportions of the limbs of Adam.32In theApocryphoneachof the limbs of the first man corresponds to the name of the angelresponsible for its creation.33The detailed attention to the limbs of thefirst man and their naming according to angelic connotations seem torecall the laterShi#ur Qomahmaterials with their tendency to name the26E.

Stone points to the originalAdamic mytheme behind this Enochic imagery. M.E.

As already mentioned, earlier schol-ars proposed that the Adamic imagery played a formative role in theshaping of the Metatron tradition. It is also possible that the concept ofthe cosmic body of the protoplast played a formative role in construct-ing the later Metatron’s office as the measurer of the divine body. Thebeginning of this significant development might be detected already in2Enoch. In order to support this hypothesis, our investigation will pro-ceed in the following manner. First, we will explore in detail the tra-dition of Adam’s body in the Slavonic apocalypse. Then, we will focuson the theme of Enoch’s corporeality in the text. Finally, we will try toestablish the relationship between both traditions in their connectionswith the motif of the Lord’sShi#ur Qomahfound in chapter39.From the Four Corners of the WorldAccording to2Enoch30:12, the prelapsarian Adam was a very specialcelestial being. The Slavonic apocalypse defines him as a second angelwho was great (Slav.velikú) and glorious. The Slavonic terminologyused for the term “great” (velikú) appears to be related to the physicaldimensions of the protoplast.2Enoch30:10provides additional proofthat the greatness might designate Adam’s proportions. In this passagethe Lord says that “even at his [Adam’s] greatest (vú veliöý)heissmall, and again at his smallest he is great.”35The conjunction of theterm “great” with the term “small” further supports the hypothesis thatthe epithet “greatness” in the text is applied to the dimensions of thefirst human.Besides these general references to the “greatness” of Adam, thetext also provides other hints about the dimensions of the patriarch’sbody. It appears that the most important evidences about the unusual34Cf. G.G. Stroumsa, “Polymorphie divine et transformations d’un mythologème:l’Apocryphon de Jean et ses sources,”VC35(1988)412–434.35Andersen, “2Enoch,”152."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"158the enoch traditionframe of the protoplast in the Slavonic apocalypse are conveyed via thetraditions about the creation and the naming of the protoplast.In2Enoch30:13the Lord tells Enoch that he created Adam outof the seven components and assigned to Adam a name from thefour “components:” from East—(A), from West—(D), from North—(A), and from South—(M).36The correspondence of the anagram ofAdam’s name with the four corners of the earth might indicate thatthe dimensions of his body are considered identical with the size ofthe earth. The Slavonic text, however, does not make this connectionexplicitly. Moreover, the question remains if this passage about theanagram is really linked to the traditions about Adam’s body. Theanalysis of the early evidences of the anagram’s motif shows that thistheme was often connected with the theme of Adam’s bodily form.In order to illustrate this point, a short excursus in the history of thistradition is needed.One of the early Jewish texts where a similar37tradition about theanagram can be found is the third book ofSibylline Oracles, a composi-tion apparently written in Egypt around160–150BCE.38It is intriguingthat already in theSibylline Oracles3:24–2739the anagram is linked to themotif of Adam’s bodily form: “Indeed it is God himself who fashionedAdam, of four letters, the first-formed man, fulfilling by his name eastand west and south and north. He himself fixed the shape of the formof men (α\u0019τ\u001bς δ\u001d \u001eστ\u001fρι ε τ!π\u0011ν μ\u0011ρ#$ς μερ%πων).”40The term “shapeof the form” (τ!π\u0011ς μ\u0011ρ#$ς) here seems to be related to the body of theprotoplast. The conflation of the anagram of Adam’s name with theshape of his form is significant for our investigation.4136The letters of this anagram correspond to Gk.'νατ\u0011λ\u001f,δ!σις,)ρκτ\u0011ς,andμεσημ-\u0014ρ\u000eα.37TheSibylline Oracleshave a slightly different sequence of the “corners”: east-west-south-north.38J.J. Collins, “Sibylline Oracles,”The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha(2vols.; ed.J.H. Charlesworth; New York: Doubleday,1985[1983]),1.355–356.39John Collins observes thatSibylline Oracles3:1–45“finds its closest parallels in theJewish Orphic fragments, which probably date to the second century B.C., and also inPhilo.” Collins, “Sibylline Oracles,”360.40Collins, “Sibylline Oracles,”362;Sibyllinische Weissagungen(ed.

A passage fromPhilo mentioned in our previous investigation indicates that by the firstcentury CE the lore about the gigantic physique of the first humansappeared to be widespread in the Alexandrian environment.2Enoch,which also contains a host of traditions pertaining to the protoplast’sbody, might have been also composed at the same time and place,namely, in the Alexandrian Diaspora of the first century CE.The tradition in which the anagram of Adam’s name was associatedwith his body was not lost in the melting pot of the Alexandrian envi-ronment but was carefully transmitted by later Jewish traditions. Thesame tendency to link the name of Adam derived from the Greek des-ignations of the four corners of the world with his body is observablein the rabbinic materials. The difference between the early accountsfound in theSibylline Oraclesand Zosimos of Panopolis and these rab-binic materials is that the latter explicitly identify the anagram, notsimply with Adam’s body, but with his cosmic body, which accordingEve.

Böttrich also refers to the pas-sages from theSibylline Oraclesand Zosimos. Böttrich, however, did not recognize themas a chain of references to the body of the protoplast. Cf.

Leazar said: He created him [Adam] as a lifeless mass extendingfrom one end of the world to the other; thus it is written, Thine eyesdid not see mine unformed substance (Ps. CXXXIX,16). R.

IV,32). And how do we know that he filled the empty spacesof the world? From the verse, “And laid Thy hand upon me” (as youread, Withdraw Thy hand from me (Job XIII,21)).46This passage indicates that the speculations about the cosmic bodyof the protoplast in the rabbinic literature were juxtaposed with thetradition about the correspondence of Adam’s name with the fourcorners of the earth. It is remarkable that the passage fromGen. R.8:1has exactly the same “sequence” of the corners as2Enoch, namely“from east (A) to west (D)” and from “north (A) to south (M),” whichprecisely corresponds to the sequence of the letters of Adam’s name.The presence of the anagram in the midrashic text points to its ancientHellenistic origin since the anagram does not carry any meaning inHebrew, but only in Greek. This tradition about the correspondenceof Adam’s cosmic body with the four corners of the world and thefour letters of his name was widespread in rabbinic literature and wasrepeated multiple times inGen. R.21:3,Gen. R.24:2,Lev. R.14:1,andLev. R.18:2. It is significant that all these passages have the same orderof the corners of the world: from east to west and from north to south.A similar tradition can be also found in thePirke de Rabbi Eliezerand theChronicles of Jerahmeelwhere the motif of Adam’s gigantic body createdfrom the four corners of the world is conflated with the story of theveneration of the protoplast by the creatures who mistakenly perceivedhim as a deity.47Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer11reads:46Midrash Rabbah(10vols.; trs.

All the creatures saw him and became afraid of him, thinkingthat he was their Creator, and they came to prostrate themselves beforehim.48In theChronicles of Jerahmeel6–12, the same tradition is repeated in avirtually identical form:...God then called Gabriel, and said unto him: “Go and bring Me dustfrom the four corners of the earth, and I will create man out of it”...

In light of this tendency, it is possible that the tradition aboutthe anagram found in2Enoch30also represents a reference to the cos-mic body of the protoplast. This suggestion is made more plausiblewhen one considers that the anagram tradition in2Enoch30:13followsimmediately after the definition of the protoplast as a great celestialcreature.5048PirkedeRabbiEliezer(tr.

Thedescription found in2Enoch30:8relates that Adam’s flesh was created from earth; hisblood from dew and from the sun; his eyes from the bottomless sea; his bones fromstone; his reason from the mobility of angels and from clouds; his veins and hair fromthe grass of the earth; his spirit from the Lord’s spirit and from wind. It is possiblethat by such postulations the text intends to stress that the primordial Adam was thecreature of macrocosmic dimensions since Adam’s creation from the seven elementsrefers to Adam as a microcosm, e.g. the anthropomorphic representation of the world.The motif of creation from the seven elements might also be linked to the traditionsassociated withShi#ur Qomahmysticism.

It is significant that, through the analogical descriptions introduced inchapter39for the first time in the Enochic tradition, a significant bondwas established between the immense body of the Lord and Enoch’sbody; this bond will later play a prominent role in Merkabah mysti-cism. In2Enoch, as with later Merkabah developments, the proximitybetween the two bodies appears also to be reinforced by additionalmetaphors. These metaphors are intended to demonstrate the closenessbetween the corporeality of the Deity and the Enoch-Metatron corpo-reality.51From the Merkabah materials one can learn that “the hand ofGod rests on the head of the youth, named Metatron.”52In2Enoch39:5the patriarch uses a similar metaphor when he tells his children that hehas seen the right hand of the Lord helping (beckoning)53him.542. In the Merkabah materials the divine corporeality is labeled as theMeasure of the Body55(\u0006\u0012\f\u0014\u0007\f\u0003\b). The same terminology is oftenapplied to Enoch-Metatron’s body. According to one of the Merk-51Ithamar Gruenwald observes that “it is hard to say whether any method liesbehind these measures, but we assume that originally the measures aimed at conveyingthe notion of ideal proportions. These proportions were shared by God and man alike.”Gruenwald,Apocalyptic and Merkavah Mysticism,214.52Synopse§384.53The same imagery can be found in Ezekiel the Tragedian’sExagoge72: “Upon itsat a man of noble mien, becrowned, and with a scepter in one hand while with theother he did beckon me....” R.G. Robertson, “Ezekiel the Tragedian,”OTP,1.812.54Cf. also2Enoch24:2(the shorter recension). “And the Lord called me; and heplaced me to the left of himself closer than Gabriel.” Andersen, “2Enoch,”143.55G. Scholem observes that the termqomahwas often translated as “height” (“Mea-surement of the Height”), used in the Biblical sense. He stresses that such translation"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"“without measure and without analogy”163abah texts, “the stature (\f\u0013\u0012\f\u0014) of this youth fills the world.”56The linkbetween the body of the patriarch and the divine body in the Slavonicapocalypse is also emphasized by identical terminology. It, therefore,comes as no surprise that in2EnochtheShi#ur Qomahterminology isapplied, not only to the body of the Lord (the stature57of the Lord), butalso to the body of the patriarch (stature of my [Enoch’s] body).3.In2Enoch39, Enoch’s body seems to serve as the measure andthe analogy through which the patriarch conveys to his children theimmeasurability of the Lord’s stature. In2Enoch39:6the termwithoutmeasure58(Slav.bezmýrno) is used immediately after the expression “thestature59of the Lord.”60This conflation of the concepts of “stature” and“measure” further strengthens G. Scholem’s hypothesis that2Enoch39might attest to the preciseShi#ur Qomahterminology, since the term\u0007\f\u0003\bcan be translated as a measure.614. It is also important that the message about the impossibility of mea-suring62the Lord’s body comes from the mouth of Enoch, depictedin various sections of2Enochas a measurer responsible for measuringdoes not apply to the Merkabah materials whereqomah, like in the Aramaic incantationtexts, signifies “body.” Cf.

Sokolov,1.38,1.94.58SomeShi#ur Qomahdescriptions also stress the idea of the immesurability of theDivine Face: “...The image of His face and the image of His cheeks is as the dimen-sions of the spirit and as the creation of the soul, such that no one can recognize it,as it is stated (in Scripture): ‘His body istarshish.’ His splendor is luminous and glowsfrom within the darkness, and (from within) the cloud and fog that surround Him andalthough they surround Him, all the princes of the Presence (supplicate) before Him as(obediently as water flows when it is poured from) a water-pitcher, because of the visionof His comeliness and beauty. There is no measurement (\u0006\u000b\u0012) in our hands; the names(alone) are revealed.” Cohen,The Shi#ur Qomah: Texts and Recensions,47.59Slav.8bü0tèe (8býtj¬)literally can be translated as “embrace.” This noun isrelated to the Slavonic verb—to embrace somebody, to fold somebody in one’s hands.Francis Andersen translates the term as “scope” (the longer recension) and “extent”(the shorter recension).602Enoch39:6“...I have seen the stature of the Lord, without measure and withoutanalogy....”61Markus Jastrow translates the term as “proportion,” “standart,” “definite quan-tity,” “size,” or “limit.” M. Jastrow,A Dictionary of the Targumim, the Talmud Babli andYerushalmi, and the Midrashic Literature(2vols.; New York: Shalom,1967),2.1565.62The stress on the immesurability of God in2Enochdoes not contradict thetheology of theShi#ur Qomahtradition. Peter Schäfer observes that “theShi#ur Qomahtradition does not intend to state that God can be ‘calculated,’ that he is, so to speak,"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"164the enoch traditionvarious earthly and celestial phenomena.63It demonstrates a remark-able parallel to the later role of Metatron as the one who conveys tovisionaries the measure/the stature of the Body. In theShi#ur Qomahsec-tion of theMerkavah Rabbah, the following tradition is attested: “I saidto him, to the Prince of Torah,64teach me the measure of our Cre-ator, and he said to me the measure of our Creator, and he said to methe measure of the body (\u0006\u0012\f\u0014\u0007\f\u0003\b).” (Synopse§688).65In later Jewishmysticism Enoch-Metatron himself is described as the measure66of thedivine body.In the conclusion of this section, it should be stressed that our anal-ysis of the description of the Lord’s corporeality in chapter39indi-cates that several features of this account manifest remarkable similari-ties to the concepts and imagery of the divine body found in the laterHekhalot and Merkabah writings. The development detectable in theSlavonic apocalypse, however, seems to represent a very early form ofthis tradition, which contains a vague sketch of what will take its defini-tive form in Jewish mysticism much later.Bodily AscentIt has been previously mentioned that Enoch’s image in2Enochappearsto be quite different from his portrait in the early Enochic circle.Among the new features that constitute this new enhanced profile ofthe seventh antedeluvian patriarch, a significant one can be foundthat seems related to our ongoing discussion about the cosmic bodya superman of enormous yet exactly measurable and conceivable dimensions ... thecompletely absurd calculations is to demonstrate that God cannot be conceived ofin human categories: he, ‘as it were,’ is like a human being and yet hidden.” P.Schäfer,The Hidden and Manifest God.

This important feature appearsin the first chapter of2Enoch, which describes the beginning of Enoch’scelestial ascent.In2Enoch1:3the reader finds the patriarch sleeping on his bed.According to the text Enoch sees a strange dream in which two hugeangelic beings, with faces like the shining sun, approach the patriarch’sbed and call him by his name. The text says that after the patri-arch was awakened by the angels, he went out from his house clos-ing the door behind him as the angels had ordered. Philip Alexanderdraws the reader’s attention to an important detail in this description;he observes that2Enoch“attests with a boldness and clarity nowherematched in1Enochthat Enoch ascended bodily to heaven...”67He alsonotes that this emphasis on the bodily ascent in the awakened condi-tion represents a departure from the early Enochic materials attestedin1(Ethiopic) Enoch, where the patriarch’s ascension to heaven seems tobe depicted as in a dream during sleep.68Alexander further observesthat this unequivocal claim that a human could bodily enter the upperrealm was profoundly problematic within the worldview of early Juda-ism.69It is intriguing that the later Merkabah Enochic accounts, as with2Enoch’s account, insist on the bodily ascension of the patriarch. Al-exander observes that,3Enoch“clearly envisages bodily ascent and sopostulates the physical metamorphosis of Enoch” during which Enoch“becomes, like other angels, physically composed of fire.”70Alexanderalso points to another consequence of this metamorphosis, namely, theenlargement of Metatron’s body until it equaled the dimensions of theworld.71This connection between the bodily ascent of the visionary and thetransformation of his body in2Enochand theSefer Hekhalotis not coin-cidental, since in the Slavonic apocalypse, for the first time in theEnochic tradition as we saw earlier, the body of the patriarch becomes67Alexander, “From Son of Adam to Second God,”104.68Ibid.,103.69Ibid.,102. It should be noted that despite the fact that1Enoch’smaterials do notattest to the bodily ascent of the visionary, the transition to this concept occurred inearly Judaism not later than the first century CE. Besides2Enoch’sevidence, whichcan be dated to the first century CE, before the destruction of the Second Temple, thePauline passage attested in2Cor12also demonstrates familiarity with the concept ofthe bodily ascent.

As has been already demon-strated in theShi#ur Qomahpassage from2Enoch39, the patriarch’s bodywas explicitly compared with the divine body and linked with it byidentical technical terminology. The insistence on the bodily ascent ofthe patriarch in2Enochseems also to constitute an important step inthe forming of this new perspective on Enoch’s physique, the develop-ment that reached its formative stage in the later Merkabah specula-tions about Metatron’s body matching the size of the world.Adam and Enoch: “Two Powers” in HeavenPrevious studies proposed that the traditions about the cosmic body ofMetatron in later Jewish mysticism might have originated as a result ofthe polemics with the traditions about the cosmic body of the proto-plast. Thus, Philip Alexander, in his comment on the motif of Enoch-Metatron enlargement in3Enoch9, refers to certain rabbinic traditions72about “the primordial Adam’s body, like that of the Gnostic protoan-thropos, [which] corresponded to the world in size, but was diminishedto the present limited dimensions of the human body as a result ofthe fall.”73He further suggests that3Enoch’saccount about the giganticbody of Enoch-Metatron “maybe expressing in mythological languagethe idea that Enoch reversed the fall of Adam.”74Moshe Idel’s research also reveals that “Jewish mystical literatureindicates ... a certain similarity between the enlarged states of Adamand Enoch.”75He notes that “the end of the gigantic Adam is well-known: he was severely reduced in his human dimensions.

Metatron was thus viewed as a preexistent divinebeing,82first incarnated in Adam and then in Enoch, who re-ascendedto the protoplast’s heavenly home and took his rightful place in theheights of the universe.83Our research will later demonstrate that in78Cf.b. Sanh.38b:“RabJudahsaidinRab’sname:Thefirstmanreachedfromone end of the world to the other... R.

Tishby,The Wisdom of the Zohar,(3vols.; London: The LittmanLibrary of Jewish Civilization,1994),2.628–629. In some Zoharic materials Metatron’sname(s), similar to Adam’s name, are also juxtaposed with the tradition about the fourcorners of the world: “This is Metatron, which is higher [than the creatures] by adistance of five hundred years. Metatron, Mitatron, Zevul, Eved, Zevoel—here are five[names], andhis names multiply in four directions to the four corners of the worldaccording tothe missions of his Master.” Tishby,The Wisdom of the Zohar,2.643.80Idel, “Enoch is Metatron,”226.81Alexander, “3Enoch,”311.82Scholem argued that in the Metatron lore one can find two possible conceptsof this angel. The first one considers him as an angelic counterpart of the seventhantediluvian patriarch translated to heaven before the Flood and transfigured into animmortal angelic being. He argued that there was also another trend in which Metatronwas not connected with Enoch or any other human prototype but was understood as apre-existent angel. See G. Scholem,Kabbalah(New York: Dorset Press,1987),378–380.83It is noteworthy that the motif of Enoch as the redeemer and the restorer ofprelapsarian humanity can be traced to2Enoch64:4–5where the patriarch is portrayedas the one who carried away the sin of humankind.

He points out that in both cases “their immense sizecaused an error of faith, namely other creatures were induced to believethat two powers governed the universe, not God alone.”84Several rabbinic and Hekhalot sources, includingb.Hag.15a,SeferHekhalot16,andMerkavah Rabbah(Synopse§672) attest to a traditionaccording to which the terrifying vision of Metatron, seated on a greatthrone at the door of the seventh palace, caused Aher to believe thatMetatron represents the second power in heaven.In3Enoch16:1–5Enoch-Metatron tells to Rabbi Ishmael the follow-ing story:At first I sat upon a great throne at the door of the seventh palace, and Ijudged all the denizens of the heights on the authority of the Holy One,blessed be he... I sat in the heavenly court. The princes of kingdomsstood beside me, to my right and to my left, by authority of the HolyOne, blessed be he. But when Aher came to behold the vision of thechariot and set eyes upon me, he was afraid and trembled before me. Hissoul was alarmed to the point of leaving him, because of his fear, dread,and terror of me, when he saw me seated85upon a throne like king, withministering angels standing beside me as servants and all the princes ofkingdoms crowned with crowns surrounding me.86Despite the prominent role that Enoch-Metatron plays in the “twopowers” controversy, the initial background of this tradition about theerroneous veneration of the exalted humanity appears to originate, notin the Enochic, but in the Adamic tradition.87Jarl Fossum’s research demonstrates that the motif of the misplacedadoration of Adam by the angels appears in several forms in the84Idel, “Enoch is Metatron,”225.85The rabbinic tradition states that there is no sitting in heaven, where accordingtob.Hag.15a, the privilege of “seating” beside God was accorded solely to Metatronby virtue of his character as a “scribe”; for he was granted permission as a scribe tosit and write down the merits of Israel. It is important that the motif of the “seating”of Enoch-Metatron in heaven is first documented in2Enoch23:4where the archangelVereveil allows the patriarch to sit down and “write everything.”86Alexander, “3Enoch,”268.87For Adam’s connection with the two powers’ traditions, see Segal’s pioneeringresearch: A.

R.8:10one can learn that whenGod created man in his own image “the ministering angels mistookhim [for a divine being] and wished to exclaim ‘Holy’ before Him...What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He caused sleep to fallupon him, and so all knew that he was [only a mortal] man.”89In theAlphabet of R. Akibathe angels’ erroneous behavior is explained throughthe reference to Adam’s gigantic body:90This teaches that initially Adam was created from the earth to thefirmament. When the ministering angels saw him, they were shockedand excited by him. At that time they all stood before the Holy One,blessed be He, and said to Him; “Master of the Universe! There are twopowers in the world, one in heaven and one on earth.” What did theHoly One, blessed be He, do then? He placed His hand on him, anddecreased him,91setting him at one thousand cubits.9288Jarl Fossum differentiates three major forms of this tradition: “(1) The angels mis-take Adam for God and want to exclaim ‘Holy’ before him, whereupon God lets sleepfall upon Adam so it becomes clear that the latter is human; (2) all creatures mistakeAdam for their creator and wish to bow before him, but Adam teaches them to renderall honor to God as their true creator; (3) the angels mistake Adam for God and wishto exclaim ‘Holy’ before him, whereupon God reduces Adam’s size.” J.

Inb.Hag.15a God punished Metatron with sixty fiery lashes. Alan Segal observes that “justas Metatron needed correction for the false impression he gave Aher, so Adam needscorrection for the false impression given the angels.” Segal,Two Powers in Heaven,112.Indeed, in the Adamic accounts of two powers the protoplast is disciplined in variousways, including the reduction of his stature.89Midrash Rabbah,1.61.90It should be noted that the traditions about the gigantic body of Adam werewidespread in the rabbinic literature.

Scholars observe93that these accounts havetheir roots in the prominent story already found in the primary Adambooks94and other early materials,95according to which God himselfordered the angels to venerate Adam, and all the angels except Satanbowed before the first human.The prototype of the story of the misplaced veneration of Enoch-Metatron also can be traced to this early Adamic lore. It is possible thatthe transition from the Adamic two powers template to the Enoch-Metatron two powers template occurred not in the rabbinic periodbut much earlier, that is, already inside the Second Temple Judaism.M. Stone has demonstrated that in2Enoch22the Adamic traditionof the protoplast’s veneration by the angels was skillfully transferredto the seventh antediluvian patriarch.96It is not coincidental that thetransference of the “two powers” tradition from Adam to Enoch wasmade for the first time in the Slavonic Apocalypse where the protoplastand the seventh antediluvian patriarch were interconnected via theconception of the cosmic body.93Altmann, “The Gnostic Background of the Rabbinic Adam Legends,”382;Fos-sum, “The Adorable Adam of the Mystics and the Rebuttals of the Rabbis,”530–531.94The account of Adam’s elevation and his veneration by angels is also found inArmenian, Georgian, and Latin versions of theLife of Adam and Eve13–15.Theseversions depict God’s creation of Adam in his image. The first man was then broughtbefore God’s face by the archangel Michael to bow down to God. God commandedall the angels to bow down to Adam. All the angels agreed to venerate the protoplast,except Satan (and his angels) who refused to bow down before Adam, because the firsthuman was “younger” than (“posterior” to) Satan.95The Slavonic version of3Baruch4;Gospel of Bartholomew4,CopticEnthronement ofMichael,Cave of Treasures2:10–24,andQur\"an2:31–39;7:11–18;15:31–48;17:61–65;18:50;20:116–123;38:71–85.96M.

Stones notes that, besidesthe motifs of Adam’s elevation and his veneration by angels, the author of2Enochappears to be also aware of the motif of angelic disobedience and refusal to veneratethe first human. M. Stone draws the reader’s attention to the phrase “sounding themout,” found in2Enoch22:6, which another translator of the Slavonic text rendered as“making a trial of them.” Stone notes that the expressions “sounding them out” or“making a trial of them” imply here that it is the angels’ obedience that is being tested.Cf.

Our investigation has also demon-strated that this connection can be detected already in2Enoch. A criticalquestion, however, still remains: how can these traditions about the cor-porealities of the two patriarchs be related to theShi#ur Qomahaccountof the Divine Face found in chapter39.It appears that the depiction of the divine anthropomorphic extent,labeled in2Enochas the Lord’s Face, serves as an important locus thatunifies the Adamic tradition of the cosmic body of the protoplast andthe Enochic tradition about the glorious angelic body of the translatedpatriarch. Our research must now turn to the analysis of the accountsof the Divine Face which unifies both traditions.It should be noted that2Enochcontains two descriptions involvingthe motif of the Divine Face. The first one occurs in2Enoch22,achapter which depicts Enoch’s encounter with the Lord in the celes-tial realm. The second account appears in chapter39where the patri-arch reports his initial theophanic experience to his sons during hisshort visit to earth, adding some new details. Although both descrip-tions demonstrate a number of terminological affinities, the secondaccount explicitly connects the Divine Face with the Lord’s anthropo-morphic “extent.” It is also significant that in both theophanic descrip-tions the stature of the Lord, His “Face,” is associated with light andfire. In biblical theophanies smoke and fire often serve as a divine enve-lope that protects mortals from the sight of the Divine Form. Radiantluminosity emitted by the Deity fulfills the same function, indicatingthe danger of the direct vision of the divine form. Luminosity alsorepresents the screen which protects the Deity from the necessity ofrevealing its true form. Scholars note that in some theophanic tradi-tions God’s form remains hidden behind His light.97The hiddenKavodis revealed through this light, which serves as a luminous screen, “theface” of this anthropomorphic extent.2Enoch’stheophanies, which usethe metaphors of light and fire, may well be connected with such tra-97April De Conick’s pioneering research shows that in Enochic traditions God’sform remains hidden behind his light.

The association between the Divine Face and theDivine Form in2Enoch39:3–6closely resembles the biblical traditionfrom Ex33:18–23, where the divinepanimis mentioned in connectionwith the glorious Divine form, God’sKavod.The motif of the Divine Face has paramount significance for ourinvestigation since it serves as a symbol decisively linking Enoch’s newlyacquired luminous angelic body with the glorious body of the proto-plast. Enoch’s luminous metamorphosis takes place in the front of theLord’s glorious “extent,” labeled in2Enochas the Lord’s “Face.” From2Enoch22one can learn that the vision of the divine “Face” had dras-tic consequences for Enoch’s appearance. His body endures radicalchanges as it becomes covered with the divine light. This encountertransforms Enoch into a glorious angelic being. The text says that afterthis procedure Enoch had become like one of the glorious ones, andthere was no observable difference.99This phrase describes Enoch’stransition to his new celestial identity as “one of the glorious ones.”During this transition in the front of the Lord’s face Enoch’s own“face” has been radically altered and the patriarch has now acquired anew glorious “visage” which reflects the luminosity100of the Lord’sPa-98The imagery of the divine Face plays an important role in Merkabah mysticism.In theHekhalot Rabbatithe following descriptions can be found: “... the holy livingcreatures ... put on garments of fire and wrap themselves in a covering of flame,and cover their faces with a lighting bolt, and the Holy One, blessed be He, unveilsHis face.”Synopse,§184. “The honored King is enthroned and He rises up the livingcreatures... They embrace Him and they kiss Him and they unveil their faces. Theyunveil themselves and the King of Glory covers His face, and the Arabot firmamentused to burst like a sieve before the face of the King.”Synopse,§189.99Andersen, “2Enoch,”139.1002Enoch’snarrative gives evidence that Enoch’s face acquired the same qualities ofluminosity as the Face of the Lord. In2Enoch37, the Lord calls one of his angels to chillthe face of Enoch before his return to earth. The angel, who “appeared frozen,” thenchilled Enoch’s face with his icy hands. Immediately after this procedure, the Lord tellsEnoch that if his face had not been chilled in such a way, no human being would beable to look at his face.

It is expressedthrough a series of analogical comparisons that demonstrates thatEnoch’s new transformed stature is fashioned in thelikenessof theLord’s “Face.”This creation in the likeness of the Lord’s Face represents an impor-tant link that connects this new angelic body of Enoch with the body ofthe glorious Adam. It has been demonstrated that the Face in2Enoch22represented the cause and the prototype after which the new celestialidentity of Enoch was “created.” The new creation fashioned after theFace signifies here the return to the prelapsarian condition of Adam,who according to the Slavonic apocalypse was also “modeled” duringhis creation after the Face of God. In2Enoch44:1one can learn thatthe protoplast was created in the likeness of God’s Face. The text saysthat “the Lord with his own two hands created mankind; in a facsimileofhis own face, both small and great, the Lord created [them].”102It isintriguing that2Enochdeparts here from the canonical reading attestedin Gen1:26–27, where Adam was created, not after the face of God,but after His image (tselem). In view of this departure, the author of therecent English translation of the Slavonic apocalypse, Francis Ander-sen, observes that2Enoch’s “idea is remarkable from any point of view... This is not the original meaning oftselem... The text usespodobie lica[in the likeness of the face], notobrazuorvidenije, the usual terms for‘image.’”103entity which now resembles the Lord’s Face. We can find a detailed description of thisprocess in another “Enochic” text, theSefer Hekhalot, which describes the transformationof Enoch-Metatron, the Prince of the Divine Presence, into a fiery creature. Cf.3Enoch15:1“R. Ishmael said: The angel Metatron, Prince of the Divine Presence, the glory ofhighest heaven, said to me: When the Holy One, blessed be he, took me to serve thethrone of glory, the wheels of the chariot and all needs of the Shekinah, at once myflesh turned to flame, my sinews to blazing fire, my bones to juniper coals, my eyelashesto lightning flashes, my eyeballs to fiery torches, the hairs of my head to hot flames,all my limbs to wings of burning fire, and the substance of my body to blazing fire.”Alexander, “3Enoch,”267.101It is noteworthy that after this procedure Enoch’s “face” itself, similar to the Lord’sface, acquired the ability to glorify other subjects. Thus, in2Enoch64:3–5the followingtradition can be found: “...and the elders of the people and all the community cameand prostrated themselves and kissed Enoch... O our father Enoch, bless your sons andall the people, so that we may be glorified in front of your face today.” Andersen, “2Enoch,”190.102Andersen, “2Enoch,”170.103Andersen, “2Enoch,”171,noteb."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"174the enoch traditionThe previous analysis, however, demonstrates that this reading doesnot arise in the Slavonic environment but belongs to the original argu-ment of2Enoch, where the creation of the luminous protoplast afterthe Face of the Lord corresponds to a similar angelic “creation” ofthe seventh antediluvian patriarch. There is almost no doubt that, inview of the information about Adam’s glorious angelic nature attestedin2Enoch30:11, the author of the Slavonic apocalypse tries to connectthe theme of Adam’s creation with the motif of the glorious Face of theLord.This connection also reveals that the bodies of the two charactersof the Slavonic apocalypse, the prelapsarian corporeality of the proto-plast and the body of his luminous counterpart, the patriarch Enoch,are both fashioned in the likeness of the third body, namely, the extentof the Lord, also known as the luminous “Face.” It is not coincidentalthat in2Enochthe interconnection of all three corporealities, the glo-rious body of the protoplast, the glorious body of the elevated Enoch,and the luminous divine body, is made via the account of the DivineFace where, according to Gershom Scholem, the preciseShi#ur Qomahterminology might have already been made evident."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"SECRETS OF CREATION IN2 (SLAVONIC) ENOCHEnoch was found blameless, andhe walked with the Lord and hewas taken away, a sign of\u0013\u000bforgenerations.(Cairo Geniza Ms. B Sirach44:16)... the learned savant who guards thesecrets of the great gods.(Tablet from Nineveh,19)I.The SecretsThe notion of “secrets” occupies a distinct place in2(Slavonic) Enoch.The importance of this terminology is highlighted by its prominentposition in the title of the book.

The purpose of this chapter is to callattention to some details of this theme in2Enoch.The StoryDespite the prominent role the word “secrets” seems to play in the titlesof the book, it occurs, quite unexpectedly, only three times in the mainbody of2Enoch, twice in chapter24and once in chapter36.Itisnot,however, coincidental that the term is found in this section of the book.Chapters24–36of2Enochcan be viewed as the climax of angelic anddivine revelations to Enoch during his celestial tour. From these chap-ters we learn that Enoch, previously described to have been “placed”into the clothes of glory and instructed by the archangel Vereveil, wascalled by the Lord. The book tells that the Lord decided to reveal toEnoch the secrets of his creation, which he never explained even tohis angels. Further the term “secrets” is applied only to this account ofGod’s creation, conveyed to Enoch by the Lord himself, “face to face.”6The content of these revelations includes the following details:1. Prior to the Creation the Lord decided to establish the foundationof all created things;2. He commanded one of the invisible “things” to come out of thevery lowest darkness and become visible;3. By Lord’s command a primordial “great aeon,” bearing the nameAdoil, descended and, disintegrating himself, revealed all creationwhich the Lord “had thought up to create”;74. The Lord created a throne for himself. He then ordered the lightto become the foundation for the highest things;4MSSV,N“And these are the books (called) the secrets of God, a revelation toEnoch.” Sokolov, “Slavjanskaja Kniga Enoha Pravednogo,”1.83.Cf.alsoB2“This isthe book of the secrets of God, a revelation to Enoch.” Sokolov,1.133.5Cf.P“The book about the secrets of Enoch, the son of Ared,” andR“The booksof the holy secrets of Enoch...” Cf.

In chapter24the Lord tells Enoch that he wants to instruct himin His secrets. In some manuscripts of the longer recension, chapter24even has a specific heading, “About the great secrets of God, which Godrevealed and related to Enoch; and he spoke with him face to face.”8Inchapter36, which serves as a conclusion of the Lord’s instruction, theLord promises Enoch the role of the expert in His secrets—“Because aplace has been prepared for you, and you will be in front of my facefrom now and forever.

Already in the earliest Enochic books of1(Ethiopic) Enoch,the knowledge and the revelation of secrets become major functionsof the elevated Enoch.10Later Enochic traditions also emphasize therole of Enoch as the “Knower of Secrets” (\u0002\u0003\t\u0007\u000b\f\u0003). According to3Enoch, Enoch-Metatron is able to behold “deep secrets and wonderfulmysteries.”11In this Merkabah text Metatron is also responsible fortransmitting the highest secrets to the Princes under him, as well as8Andersen, “2Enoch,”1.140.9Andersen, “2Enoch,”1.161.10The origin of the role in Enochic traditions can be traced to1Enoch72:1,74:2,and80:1.In1Enoch41:1Enoch is attested as the one who “saw all secrets of heaven....”M.

According to thesestudies, one of these possible prototypes can be an intriguing char-acter of the “Sumerian” Kings list—Enmeduranki, king of Sippar.In three copies of the List he occupies the seventh place, which inGenesis’ genealogy belongs to Enoch. In other Mesopotamian sourcesEnmeduranki appears in many roles and situations remarkably similarto Enoch’s story. Among these roles are that of the knower and theguardian of the secrets of gods.14The tablet from Nineveh, possibly dated before1100BCE, is aprimary witness to the parallels between the stories of Enoch andEnmeduranki.15The text, reconstructed by W.G.

Bockmuehl observes that the term\t\u0007inDaniel always relates in some way to a disclosure of the future.25Thelabeling of disclosures of the future as “secrets” becomes a promi-nent motif in the later “Enochic” text,Sefer Hekhalot.In3Enoch11:2–3Enoch-Metatron tells R.

First,2Enochdoes not apply the notion of“secrets” to many types of revelation. This term occurs very rarely inthe book and is reserved only for the particular cosmogonic31revelationof the Lord. Second, the term is never applied to an earthly affair, noteven in reference to historical and eschatological information. Third,the “secret name” does not play any significant role in2Enoch’scos-mogony. Fourth, the angels in2Enochdo not know about God’s cos-mogonic “secrets.”Moreover, it seems that in2Enochthe realm of the secrets, even“topologically,” transcends the angelic world. The shorter recensiontells us that before the cosmogonic revelation took place, the Lord had“placed” Enoch to the left of Himself, closer than Gabriel.32Further,the Lord confirms the transcendence of the knowledge about creationover the angelic world when He informs Enoch that even to his angelsHe has explained neither his secrets nor his “endless and inconceivablecreation which He conceived.”33The “secrecy” of the Lord’s revelation is underscored further byseveral additional factors.First, immediately following the cosmogonic instructions, the Lordinformed Enoch that he appointed an intercessor, the archangel Mi-chael, and guardian angels, Arioch and Marioch,34for Enoch’s writingswhich should not perish in the impending flood:30I.

It might indicate that we are dealing herewith the famous “secret” books by which antediluvian wisdom reachedpostdeluvian generations. This motif of antediluvian “secret” writingshas a number of parallels in Mesopotamian lore.36Second, the esoteric details of the Lord’s cosmogonic revelations donot appear in chapters39–66, dedicated to Enoch’s instructions to hischildren. In these chapters Enoch shares the information about hisheavenly tour and his extraordinary experiences near the Throne ofGlory. He conveys to his children an esoteric knowledge which includesmeteorological, cosmological, and eschatological information. In thissection of the book Enoch even offers a lengthy description of theLord’s limbs “without measure and analogy”37which, some scholarsbelieve, belongs to another highly esoteric trend of Jewish mysticism.38The full account of God’s cosmogonic revelations, however, does notappear in these instructions of Enoch. Even though the text makesseveral allusions to the creation story, telling us that “the Lord wasthe one who laid the foundations upon the unknown things and ...spread out the heavens above the visible and the invisible things,”39Enoch never discloses to his children the full story about Adoil andArukhas.35Andersen, “2Enoch,”1.157.36Cf.

The simi-larities include the following points:1. One of these parallels is Enoch’s initiation into the secrets of Cre-ation. The important detail in both texts is that some preparatoryinstructions before the account of creation were given through angels.In the case of3Enoch, the instructions were given through the angelsknown as the “Prince of Wisdom” (\u0006\u0012\u0015\u0011\u0006\u0007\b) and the “Prince ofUnderstanding” (\u0006\u0004\u0003\u0016\u0006\u0007\b); in the case of2Enochthey came throughthe angel Vereveil (Vereveil). In both books these angelic mediatorsdo not reveal “secrets” but offer instead some preparatory knowledge.In2EnochVereveil instructs Enoch in different “things”—“all things ofheaven and earth and sea and all the elements and the movements andtheir courses ... and the Hebrew language, every kind of language ofthe new song of the armed troops and everything that it is appropri-ate to learn” (23:1–2).40In3Enochthe Prince of Wisdom and the Princeof Understanding teach Enoch-Metatron “wisdom”—“the wisdom ofthose above and those below, the wisdom of this world and the world tocome.”412. Both texts also mention that immediately after these preparatoryangelic instructions, the Lord (the Holy One) reveals “the secrets ofcreation” to Enoch (Metatron). From3Enoch11:2we learn that all thesecrets of creation (\u0013\u0003\b\u000e\u0007\u0016\u0003\u0007\u0013\r)42now stand revealed before Enoch-Metatron as they stand revealed before the Creator.

And not even to my angels have I explained my secrets, nor relatedto them their composition, nor my endless and inconceivable creationwhich I conceived, as I am making them known to you today.433. As was mentioned earlier, the notion of “secrets” in3Enochincludesvarious types of revelations. Even though the book applies the term“secrets” to several things, including the Torah, it also seems to usethe notion of “the special secret” in reference to certain details of theAccount of Creation. According to the book, this special secret playsan important role in “God’s creation of everything.” We learn aboutthe secret from3Enoch48D, where Metatron tells R. Ishmael that hewas the person who revealed the special secret Moses, in spite of theprotests of the heavenly hosts:YHWH the God of Israel is my witness that when I revealed this secretto Moses, all the armies of the height, in every heaven, were angry withme. They said to me, “Why are you revealing this secret to humankind,born of woman, blemished, unclean, defiled by blood and impure flux,men who excrete putrid drops—that secret by which heaven and earthwere created, the sea and the dry land, mountains and hills, rivers andsprings, Gehinnom, fire and hail, the garden of Eden and the tree of life?By it Adam was formed, the cattle and the beasts of the field, the birdsof heaven and the fish of the sea, Behemoth and Leviathan, the uncleancreatures and reptiles, the creeping things of the sea and the reptiles ofthe deserts, Torah, wisdom, knowledge, thought, the understanding ofthings above, and the fear of heaven. Why are you revealing it to fleshand blood?”44P. Alexander observes that in this passage “the secret” could be either(1) the Torah, or (2) the secret names of God. He further suggests that“the identification of the secret with the Torah appears to be excludedby the fact that Torah is one of the things created by the secret.”45This situation in which the notion of “secret” transcends the realm ofthe Torah and refers instead to God’s creation appears to have closeaffinities to the position of2Enoch, where the Torah is not listed amongGod’s mysteries.43Andersen, “2Enoch,”1.143.44Alexander, “3Enoch,”1.315.45Alexander, “3Enoch,”1.315."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"186the enoch traditionIII.Secrets of Creation in the Zoharic TraditionThe cosmogonic account in2Enochdemonstrates close similarities notonly with that in the Merkabah tradition46but also with much laterdevelopments of Jewish mysticism. The following analysis is an attemptto trace some affinities between the account of creation in2Enochandthat in some medieval texts of Jewish mysticism.StonesIn one of his books47G. Scholem points to an interesting detail in thecreation narrative in2Enoch. The story involves the enigmatic stonesthe Lord placed in the waters during the process of creation. In chap-ters28–29, when the Lord instructed Enoch about the secrets of theAccount of Creation, He said:Then from the waters I hardened48big stones,49and the clouds of thedepths50I commanded to dry themselves. And I did not name whatfell to the lowest places.51Gathering the ocean into one place, I boundit with a yoke. I gave to the sea an eternal boundary, which will notbe broken through by the waters. The solid structure52Ifixedandestablished it above the waters (28:2–4).53The theme of the “big stones” plays an important role in the creationnarrative of2Enoch. G. Scholem draws attention to the relationshipbetween these enigmatic stones and the cosmogonic tradition of “anesoteric baraitha54in which the word\f\u0006\u0016in\f\u0006\u0016\f\f\u0006\u0013of Genesis1:2was46On the Merkabah features of2Enochcf.

Cosmogonic doctrines, however, were important duringall stages of Jewish mysticism,57and occupied a prominent place in suchbooks asSefer YetsirahandSefer ha-Bahir.58Isaiah Tishby observes that theunderstanding of the causes and processes of the formation of the worldbecame one of the central themes in late Jewish mysticism.59In late Jewish mysticism, especially in theZohar, the theme of the bigstones placed by the Creator in the waters (in the abyss) occupied animportant place. In spite of the late date of theZohar, these materialshave preserved important early traditions relevant to the subject ofour research. Moreover, this medieval compendium of Jewish mysticalknowledge mentions a book under the title “The Book of the Secretsof Enoch”60which is identical with the titles given to2Enochin somemanuscripts.61Similarities between2Enochand theZoharare not confined only tothe title of theSlavonic Enoch. Several scholars, including G.H. Box andH. Odeberg, have noted striking parallels between both texts, especiallyin the materials of the longer recension. G.H. Box points to the con-nection between2Enochand theZoharand observes that “theSlavonicEnoch... is remarkably illuminating in its realistic presentment of someof the Kabbalistic ideas—e.g. as to the process of creation, the consti-55Scholem,Origins of the Kabbalah,74. He points also to “the muddy stones fromwhich darkness flows” in the Targum on Job28:8. Another interesting early parallelcould be “stones of bohu” in Isa34:11.56Gershom Scholem was a unique exception in his field, as he persistently tried toinvestigate the relationships between2Enochand the Jewish mystical traditions. Eventhough his observations on possible parallels between2Enochand Jewish texts are notsystematic, they are very perceptive and can provide many insights for students of2Enoch.57Cf.G.Scholem,Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism(New York: Schocken,1954).58For the discussion of the parallels between the cosmogonies of these two texts and2Enochcf.

Odeberg, who was Box’s stu-dent at the University of London, holds a similar view.63In spite ofsome apparent deficiencies in his edition64of3Enochhis work containsimportant insights into possible relationships between theSlavonic Enochand late Jewish mysticism. Odeberg, who used Forbes’ separate transla-tions of the shorter and longer recensions of2Enoch, makes a numberof provocative comments on the nature of the Jewish mystical tradi-tions incorporated in these texts. In his opinion, the longer recensionsometimes contains concepts that belong to a later (post-Hekhaloth)development of Jewish mysticism. In this respect, he found a numberof striking similarities with the Zoharic tradition. It should be notedthat Odeberg’s position was partially conditioned by his favoring of theshorter recension as more ancient and original.65He viewed the longerrecension as a later expansion of the shorter one. In the light of therecent studies of F. Andersen, J. Charlesworth,66A. de Santos Otero,67and C. Böttrich,68who argue for the originality of the longer recension,Odeberg’s hypothesis is losing its persuasive power. In this context aninvestigation of the possible parallels between the story of creation in2Enochand the Account of Creation in theZoharcan contribute notonly to our understanding of the hypothetical provenance of the longerrecension but to the provenance of the text in general. It also can clarifythe formative value of the account of creation in2Enochfor subsequent62W.O.E. Oesterley and G.H.

The importance of such inquiry constitutes oneof the reasons for the inclusion of some materials from theBook of Zoharin our research.ZoharI,231a reads:The world did not come into being until God took a certain stone, whichis called the “foundation stone,”69and cast it into the abyss70so that itheld fast there, and from it the world was planted. This is the centralpoint of the universe, and on this point stands the holy of holies. This isthe stone referred to in the verses, “Who laid the corner-stone thereof ”(Job XXXVIII,6), “the stone of testing, the precious corner-stone” (Is.XXVIII,16), and “the stone that the builders despise became the headof the corner” (Ps. CXVIII,22). This stone is compounded of fire, water,and air, and rests on the abyss. Sometimes water flows from it and fillsthe deep. This stone is set as a sign in the centre of the world.71ZoharII,222a continues the theme of the foundation stone:When the Holy One, blessed be He, was about to create the world, Hedetached one precious stone72from underneath His Throne of Gloryand plunged it into the Abyss, one end of it remaining fastened thereinwhilst the other end stood out above; and this other and superior headconstituted the nucleus of the world, the point out of which the worldstarted, spreading itself to right and left and into all directions, andby which it is sustained. That nucleus, that stone, is calledshethyiah(foundation), as it was the starting-point of the world. The nameshethyiah,furthermore, is a compound ofshath(founded) andYa h(God), signifyingthat the Holy One, blessed be He, made it the foundation and starting-point of the world and all that is therein.73We will now examine some important similarities between2Enochandthese Zoharic passages. The text of2Enochuses the termbezdna74(lit-erally, “abyss”) which also occupied a prominent place in the narrativeof theZohar.IntheZohar, the Holy One cast a stone into the abyss.2Enochdoes not mention that the stone fell into the abyss but does uti-lize the phrase, “I did not name what fell to the abyss” (28:3), with theimplication that this act of the Lord had already taken place.69\u0006\u0003\u0013\b\u0018\u0016\u000e.

The concept of the “Foundation Stone” occupies a promi-nent place in several cosmological stories.76E. Burrows’ research pointsto the Mesopotamian provenance of the concept of the “FoundationStone,” which symbolizes in these traditions the bond between heavenand earth.77Burrows traces the geographical origins of this cosmogonicpattern to “the sanctuaries at Nippur, at Larsa, and probably at Sip-par.”78The possible connection with Sippar is especially important forthe Enochic text, if we keep in mind the possible Mesopotamian ori-gin of Enoch’s figure, based on the antediluvian king Enmeduranki ofSippar.Finally, the difference in the number of stones in both texts mustalso be explained. TheZohartells about one foundation stone,2Enochspeaks about stones.79But later in the narrative of2Enoch,thetermswitches from the plural to the singular, and refers only to one stone:“From the stone I cut offa great fire... (29:3).”80Adoil and Arukhaz: Etymology of the NamesDuring His instructions in the secrets of creation, the Lord told Enochthat in the beginning of creation he had thought to create a visiblecreation from the invisible. This process occupies an important place inthe narrative of2Enochand demonstrates in complicated imagery thisstage of creation. To assist our inquiry, the following passage must bequoted:75Tverdü vodruæih i 8snovah vrúhu vod(literally—“I erected a firm foundationand established it above the waters”).76On the concept of the Foundation Stone, see L.

And I commanded the lowestthings: “Let one of the invisible things come out visibly!” And Adoil81descended, extremely large. And I looked at him, and, behold, in hisbelly he had a great age.82And I said to him, “Disintegrate yourself,Adoil, and let what is disintegrated from you become visible.” And hedisintegrated himself, and there came out from him the great age. Andthus it carried all the creation which I had wished to create. And I sawhow good it was. And I placed for myself a throne, and I sat down onit. To the light I spoke: “You go up higher and be solidified and becomethe foundation for the highest things.” And there is nothing higher thanthe light, except nothing itself. And I spoke, I straightened myself upwardfrom my throne. And I called out a second time into the lowest things,and I said, “Let one of the invisible things come out solid and visible.”There came out Arukhas,83solid and heavy and very black.

And become the foundation of the lowest things!” And there isnothing lower than the darkness, except nothing itself (24–26).84The passage deals with two enigmatic names, Adoil and Arukhas.Much attention has been devoted to the etymology of these wordswhich might indicate that many scholars consider these names as im-portant cues for clarifying the origins of the text.R.H. Charles asserts that Adoil might be derived from Hebrew,\u000b\u0003\u000f\u000e, translated as “The hand of God.”85M. Philonenko supports thisetymology pointing to some Egyptian parallels in which “les premièrescréatures naissent du liquide séminal que le démiurge solitaire avait faitjaillir au moyen de sa main.”86L.

Milik considers the name Adoil as “a Greek and Semitic hybrid:Hades + El.”91G. Quispel derives it fromAdonai-el, where the first ele-ment is the circumlocution for the Tetragrammaton.92Another proper name in the narrative, Arukhaz, also poses severalproblems for interpretation. R.H. Charles believes that Arukhaz mayhave originated from the Hebrew word\u0003\u0014\u0007(“firmament”).93A. Vaillant supports the view that the term “Arukhaz” is connectedwith the image of foundation (Greek,στερ\u0015ωμα;Hebrew,\u0003\u0014\u0007). In hisopinion it was composed from the Hebrew words\u0010\f\u0007“arranged” and\t“hard.”94J. Milik traced “Arukhaz” to the Hebrew feminine term\u0006\u0015\f\u0007\u000e(“geo-graphical basin”), transcribed with the masculine flexional ending asArukhaz.95F. Andersen, while thinking that the name could probably be derivedfrom the Greek word'ρ*\u001f, points out that the ending -as, which is notSlavonic, is doubtful.96He opts for another translation that connects thename with a Hebrew word\u0010\f\u0007(“extended”).97However, some materials found in theZoharmight lead us to quitedifferent interpretations of the names “Adoil” and “Arukhas.” In theZoharI,17b one may find some provocative material from the Accountof Creation that describes the same stage in the story of creation whichbegan, just as the passage of2Enoch, with the idea of establishing a“foundation”:Let there be a firmament: i.e. let there be a gradual extension.

A similar correspondence can be found in2Enochwhere Adoilis matched with the upper foundation.The same symmetrical pattern also shows in the case of Arukhaz:Arukhaz, the lower foundation in2Enoch, and the “other extension,”the lower waters in theZohar.

These inferences will be concernedmainly with the form and the content of the examined textual material.1.2Enochappears to contain a systematic tendency of treating the storyof creation as containing the most esoteric knowledge. Even though2Enochdeals with various meterological, astronomical, and cosmologi-cal revelations, it specifically emphasizes the “secrecy” of the account ofcreation.2Enoch, unlike other early apocalyptic materials (such as theBook of Daniel and1Enoch), does not include the variety of “revealedthings” in the notion of “secrets.”2.2Enoch’semphasis on the “secrecy” of the creation story demon-strates an intriguing parallel to the later rabbinic approach to\u0006\b\u0012\u0013\u0003\b\u000e\u0007\u0016as esoteric knowledge.2Enoch, therefore, can be seen as animportant step in the shaping of the later rabbinic understanding of“secret things,” which eventually led to the esoterism of the Account ofCreation.3. The Account of Creation in2Enochincludes the cosmogonic motifsof God’s creation of the primordial order. These descriptions show anumber of parallels with late Jewish mysticism, namely the Zoharictradition. It supports the Box-Odeberg hypothesis, that the creationnarrative of the longer recension shows a presentment of some of theZoharic ideas of creation. At this stage of our research, it is difficultto determine whether these blocks of the Account of Creation are105M.

This reference might allude to another distinctive role of theexalted angel, to his office of the celestial choirmaster, that is, one whodirects the angelic liturgy taking place before the Throne of Glory. Thetradition attested in3Enoch15B, however, does not explicate this role ofMetatron, most likely because of the fragmentary nature of this passagewhich is considered by scholars as a late addition toSefer Hekhalot.5A similar description inSynopse3906appears to have preserved betterthe original tradition about Metatron’s unique liturgical role.

The form of the workin the major manuscripts demonstrates “clear signs of editing.” Scholars observe that“3Enochhas arisen through the combination of many separate traditions: it tends tobreak down into smaller ‘self-contained’ units which probably existed prior to theirincorporation into the present work... It is not the total product of a single authorat particular point in time, but the deposits of a ‘school tradition’ which incorporateselements from widely different periods” (Alexander, “3Enoch,”223). Alexander alsoobserves that “an inspection of the textual tradition shows that chapters3–15/16,which describe the elevation of Enoch, circulated as an independent tract...and itis intrinsically probable that these chapters formed the core round which the longerrecensions grew” (Alexander, “The Historical Settings of the Hebrew Book of Enoch,”156–157).

This passage also indicates that Metatron is not only theone who protects and prepares the heavenly hosts for their praise tothe deity,8but also the choirmaster who himself conducts the liturgi-cal ceremony by invoking the divine name. The passage underlines theextraordinary scope of Metatron’s own vocal abilities that allow himto invoke the deity’s name in seven voices. Yet the portrayal of thiscelestial choirmaster intentionally “deafening” the members of his ownchoir might appear puzzling. A close examination of Hekhalot litur-gical theology may however help clarify the paradoxal imagery. PeterSchäfer points out that in the Hekhalot writings “the heavenly praise isdirected solely toward God” since “for all others who hear it—men aswell as angels—it can be destructive.”9As an example, Schäfer refers toa passage fromHekhalot Rabbatiwhich offers a chain of warnings aboutthe grave dangers encountered by those who dare to hear the angelicpraise.10James Davila’s recent study also confirms the importance ofthe motif of the dangerous encounters in the course of the heavenlyworship in Hekhalot liturgical settings.117Peter Schäfer, with M.

Despitethis apparent absence, this study will argue that the roots of Enoch-Metatron’s liturgical imagery can be traced to the Second TempleEnochic lore, namely, to2Enoch, a Jewish apocalypse, apparently writ-ten in the first century CE.

Enoch’saffiliations with the heavenly Temple in theBook of the Watchers(1En.1–36), theBook of Dreams(1En.83–90), and the book ofJubileescanbe seen as the gradual evolution from the implicit references to hisheavenly priesthood in the earliest Enochic materials to a more overtrecognition and description of his sacerdotal function in the later ones.While later Enochic traditions attested in the book ofJubileesunam-biguously point to Enoch’s priestly role by referring to his incense sac-rifice in the celestial sanctuary, the earlier associations of the patri-12It appears that the angelic hosts must be protected, not for the whole course of thecelestial liturgy, but only during the invocation of the divine name.

She notes that the Ethiopic text reports that,in order to reach God’s Throne, the patriarch passes through threecelestial constructions: a wall, an outer house, and an inner house.The Greek version of this narrative mentions a house instead of a wall.Himmelfarb observes that “more clearly in the Greek, but also in theEthiopic this arrangement echoes the structure of the earthly templewith its vestibule (\u0002\u000f\f\u000e), sanctuary (\u000f\u0015\u0003\u0006), and holy of holies (\u0007\u0003\u0016\u000b).”15God’s Throne is located in the innermost chamber of this heavenlystructure and is represented by a throne of cherubim. It can be seen asa heavenly counterpart to the cherubim found in the Holy of Holies inthe Jerusalem Temple.16In drawing parallels between the descriptionsof the heavenly Temple in theBook of the Watchersand the features ofthe earthly sanctuary, Himmelfarb observes that the “fiery cherubim”which Enoch sees on the ceiling of the first house (Ethiopic) or middlehouse (Greek) of the heavenly structure represent, not the cherubim ofthe divine Throne, but images that recall the figures on the hangingson the wall of the terrestrial tabernacle mentioned in Exod.26:1,31;36:8,35or possibly the figures which, according1Kgs6:29,2Chron.3:7and Ezek.41:15–26, were engraved on the walls of the earthlyTe m p l e.1715Himmelfarb, “Apocalyptic Ascent and the Heavenly Temple,”210.16One comment must be made about the early traditions and sources that maylie behind the descriptions of the upper sanctuary in1En.14.Scholarsobservethatthe idea of heaven as a temple was not invented by the author of theBook of theWa t c h e rssince the concept of the heavenly temple as a heavenly counterpart of theearthly sanctuary was widespread in the ancient Near East and appears in a numberof biblical sources. Cf. Himmelfarb, “The Temple and the Garden of Eden,”68.Students of Jewish priestly traditions previously noted that the existence of such aconception of the heavenly sanctuary appears to become increasingly important inthe times of religious crises when the earthly sanctuaries were either destroyed or“defiled” by “improper” rituals or priestly successions. For an extensive discussion ofthis subject, see B. Egoet al.

Himmelfarb observes that the priests of theheavenly Temple in theBook of the Watchersappear to be representedby angels, since the author of the text depicts them as the ones “stand-ing before God’s Throne in the heavenly temple.”18She also points tothe possibility that in theBook of the Watchersthe patriarch himself inthe course of his ascent becomes a priest19similarly to the angels.”20In this perspective, the angelic status of the patriarch and his priestlyrole21are viewed as mutually interconnected. Himmelfarb stresses that“the author of theBook of the Watchersclaims angelic status for Enochthrough his service in the heavenly temple” since “the ascent shows18Himmelfarb, “Apocalyptic Ascent and the Heavenly Temple,”211. David Hal-perin also supports this position. In his view, “the angels, barred from the inner house,are the priests of Enoch’s heavenly Temple. The high priest must be Enoch himself,who appears in the celestial Holy of Holies to procure forgiveness for holy beings”(Haplerin,The Faces of the Chariot,82).19Halperin’s studies also stress the apocalyptic priestly function of Enoch in theBookof the Watchers. He observes that “Daniel and Enoch share an image, perhaps drawnfrom the hymnic tradition of merkabah exegesis (think of the Angelic liturgy), of Godsurrounded by multitudes of angels. But, in the Holy of Holies, God sits alone.... Theangels, barred from the inner house, are the priests of Enoch’s heavenly Temple. Thehigh priest must be Enoch himself, who appears in the celestial Holy of Holies toprocure forgiveness for holy beings” (Halperin,Faces of the Chariot,81–82).20Himmelfarb, “Apocalyptic Ascent and the Heavenly Temple,”213.21George Nickelsburg’s earlier study on the temple symbolism in1En.14providessome important additional details relevant to our ongoing discussion. Nickelsburgargues that Enoch’s “active” involvement in the vision of the Lord’s Throne, when hepasses through the chambers of the celestial sanctuary, might indicate that the author(s),of theBook of the Watchersperceived him as a servant associated with the activities inthese chambers. Nickelsburg points to the fact that Enoch’s vision of the Throne in theBook of the Watchersis “qualitatively different from that described in the biblical thronevisions” by way of the new active role of its visionary. This new, active participationof Enoch in the vision puts1En.14closer to later Merkabah accounts which aredifferent from biblical visions. Nickelsburg stresses that in the biblical throne visions, theseer is passive or, at best, his participation is reactional. In contrast, in the Merkabahaccounts, Enoch appears to be actively involved in his vision. In Nickelsburg’s view,the verbal forms of the narrative (“Idrew nearthe wall,” “Iwent intothat house”),serve as further indications of the active “participation” of the seer in the visionary“reality” of the heavenly Throne/Temple. On the other hand, biblical visions arenot completely forgotten by Enochic authors and provide an important exegeticalframework for1En.14. Comparing the Enochic vision with the Ezekelian accountof the temple, Nickelsburg suggests that the Enochic narrative also represents a visionof the temple, but, in this case, the heavenly one. He argues that “the similarities toEzek.40–48, together with other evidence, indicate that Enoch is describing his ascentto the heavenly temple and his progress through itstemenosto the door of the holy ofholies, where the chariot throne of God is set” (Nickelsburg, “Enoch, Levi, and Peter,”579–581)."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"the liturgical role of enoch-metatron205him passing through the outer court of the temple and the sanctuary tothe door of the holy of holies, where God addresses him with his ownmouth.”22It is important for our investigation to note that, despite thefact that Enoch appears to be envisioned as an angel by the authors ofthe text, nothing is said about his leading role in the angelic liturgy.The traditions about the seventh patriarch’s heavenly priesthood arenot confined solely to the materials found in theBook of the Watchers,since they are attested in other1Enoch’s materials, including theAnimalApocalypse(1En.85–90).It is noteworthy that, whereas in theBook of the WatchersEnoch’s asso-ciations with the heavenly Temple are clothed with rather ambiguousimagery, his depictions in theAnimal Apocalypsedo not leave any seriousdoubts that some of the early Enochic traditions understood Enoch tobe intimately connected with the heavenly sanctuary.Chapter87of1Enochportrays the patriarch taken by three angelsfrom the earth and raised to a high tower, where he is expected toremain until he will see the judgment prepared for the Watchers andtheir earthly families.1Enoch87:3–4reads:And those three who came out last took hold of me by my hand, andraised me from the generations of the earth, and lifted me on to a highplace, and showed meatowerhigh above the earth, and all the hills werelower. And one said to me: “Remain here until you have seen everythingwhich is coming upon these elephants and camels and asses, and uponthe stars, and upon all the bulls.”23James VanderKam notes a significant detail in this description, namely,Enoch’s association with a tower. He observes that this term24is re-served in theAnimal Apocalypsefor a Temple.25The association of thepatriarch with the tower is long-lasting, and apparently he must havespent there a considerable amount of time, since the text does not22Himmelfarb, “Apocalyptic Ascent and the Heavenly Temple,”212.23Knibb,The Ethiopic Book of Enoch,1.294;2.198.24Cf.1En.89:50: “And that house became large and broad, and for those sheep ahigh tower was built on that house for the Lord of the sheep; and that house was low,but the tower was raised up and high; and the Lord of the sheep stood on that tower,and they spread a full table before him” (Knibb,The Ethiopic Book of Enoch,2.208);1En.89.73: “And they began again to build, as before, and they raised up that tower, and itwas called the high tower; and they began again to place a table before the tower, butall the bread on it (was), unclean and was not pure” (Knibb,The Ethiopic Book of Enoch,2.211).25J.

So the patriarch is depicted as present in the heavenlysanctuary for most of theAnimal Apocalypse.26Although the traditions about Enoch’s associations with the heavenlyTemple in theBook of the Watchersand in theAnimal Apocalypsedo notrefer explicitly to his performance of the priestly duties, the accountattested in the book ofJubileesexplicitly makes this reference.Jubilees4:23depicts Enoch to be taken from human society andplaced in Eden27“for (his) greatness and honor.”28The Garden is thendefined as a sanctuary29and Enoch as one who is offering an incensesacrifice on the mountain of incense: “He burned the evening incense30of the sanctuary which is acceptable before the Lord on the mountainof incense.”31VanderKam suggests that here Enoch is depicted as one who “per-forms the rites of a priest in the temple.”32Furthermore, he observesthat Enoch’s priestly duties represent a new element in “Enoch’s ex-panding portfolio.”3326VanderKam,Enoch: A Man for All Generations,117.27For Enoch’s place in the heavenly Paradise, seeTestament of Benjamin10:6;Apocalypseof Paul20;Clementine Recognitions1:52;Acts of Pilate25;andtheAscension of Isaiah9:6.Cf.C.Rowland,“Enoch,”inK.vanderToornet al.

VanderKam,The Book of Jubilees(2vols.; CSCO,510–511; Scriptores Aethiopici,87–88; Leuven: Peeters,1989),2.28.29VanderKam argues that there are other indications that in the bookof JubileesEden was understood as a sanctuary. As an example, he points to Jub.3.9–14,which“derives the law from Lev11regarding when a women who has given birth may enterthe sanctuary from the two times when Adam and Eve, respectively, went into thegarden” (VanderKam,Enoch:A Man for All Generation,117).30One must note the peculiar details surrounding the depiction of Enoch’s priestlyduties in early Enochic lore. While theBook of the Watchersdoes not refer to anyliturgical or sacrificial rituals of the patriarch,Jubileesdepicts the patriarch offeringincense to God. The absence of references to any animal sacrificial or liturgical prac-tice in Enoch’s sacerdotal duties might indicate that his office may have been under-stood by early Enochic traditions to be of the “divinatory angle,” that is, as theoffice of oracle-priest, practiced also by the Mesopotamian diviners who, similarlyto Enoch’s preoccupation with incense, widely used the ritual of libanomancy, orsmoke divination, a “practice of throwing cedar shavings onto a censer in order toobserve the patterns and direction of the smoke” (M.S.

Gabriele Boccaccini observes that"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"the liturgical role of enoch-metatron207The purpose of the aforementioned analysis was to demonstratethat, despite the fact that the early Enochic materials found in1EnochandJubileesemphasize the patriarch’s association with the heavenlysanctuary, they do not contain any references to his role in directingthe celestial liturgy. Unlike the later Merkabah materials where thepriestly duties of Enoch-Metatron are often juxtaposed with his litur-gical activities, early Enochic lore does not link these two sacerdotalfunctions. Moreover, it appears that in1EnochandJubileesEnoch doesnot play any leading role in the celestial liturgy. Thus, for example, intheBook of the Similitudes(1En.37–71), where the celestial liturgy playsan important part, the patriarch does not play any significant role (1En.39). Moreover, the text stresses that Enoch is unable to sustainthe frightening “Presence” of the deity. In1Enoch39:14the patriarchlaments that during celestial liturgy his “face was transformed” until hewas not able to see.34This lament makes clear that Enoch’s capacitiescan in no way be compared with Metatron-Youth’s potentialities whichare able not only to sustain the terrifying Presence of the deity butalso to protect others, including the angelic hosts during the celestialliturgy.These conceptual developments indicate that in the early Enochicmaterials the leading role of the translated patriarch in the sacerdotalsettings remains solely priestly, but not liturgical. Unlike the later Merk-abah materials where the theme of the celestial sanctuary (the taber-nacle of the Youth) is often conflated with Metatron’s role as the celes-tial choirmaster, the early Enochic materials associated with1EnochandJubileesshow only one side of the story. Our study must now proceed tothe testimonies about Metatron’s priestly and liturgical activities in theHekhalot and theShi#ur Qomahmaterials.“Enochians completely ignore the Mosaic torah and the Jerusalem Temple, that is thetwo tenets of the order of the universe.” In his opinion, “the attribution to Enochof priestly characteristics suggests the existence of a pure prediluvian, and pre-fall,priesthood and disrupts the foundation of the Zadokite priesthood, which claimed itsorigin in Aaron at the time of exodus, in an age that, for the Enochians, was alreadycorrupted after the angelic sin and the flood” (G. Boccaccini,Beyond the Essene Hypothesis:The Parting of the Ways between Qumran and Enochic Judaism[Grand Rapids: Eerdmans,1998],74).34Knibb,The Ethiopic Book of Enoch,2.127."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"208the enoch traditionTabernacle of the Youth: Priestly and Liturgical Rolesof Enoch-Metatron in the Merkabah TraditionIt has been already mentioned that, in contrast to the early Enochicbooklets which do not provide any hints as to Enoch’s leading rolein the heavenly liturgy, in the Merkabah tradition the priestly roleof Enoch-Metatron is closely intertwined with his pivotal place in thecourse of the angelic worship. Since both of these sacerdotal functionsare closely interconnected, before we proceed to a detailed analysisof the liturgical imagery associated with this exalted angel, we mustexplore Metatron’s priestly duties, which in many respects echo anddevelop further the earlier Enochic traditions about the sacerdotalduties of the seventh antediluvian hero.Heavenly High PriestWhile the early Enochic materials depict the seventh antediluvian patri-arch as a newcomer who just arrives to his new appointment in theheavenly sanctuary, the Merkabah materials portray Metatron as anestablished celestial citizen who is firmly placed in his sacerdotal officeand even possesses his own heavenly sanctuary that now bears hisname. Thus in the passage found inMerkabah Shelemahthe heavenlytabernacle is called the “tabernacle of Metatron” (\u0018\f\u0007\u0019\u0019\u0012\u0018\u0015\b\u0012). In thetradition preserved inNum. R.12.12, the heavenly sanctuary again isassociated with one of Metatron’s designations and is named the “taber-nacle of the Youth” (\u0007\u0004\u0006\u0018\u0015\b\u0012):35R. Simon expounded: When the Holy One, blessed be He, told Israel toset up the Tabernacle He intimated to the ministering angels that theyalso should make a Tabernacle, and the one below was erected the otherwas erected on high.

Both Enochic and Hekhalot traditionsseem to allude here to Enoch-Metatron’s role as the celestial high priestsince he approaches the realm where the ordinary angelic or humancreatures are not allowed to enter, namely, the realm of the immediatePresence of the deity, the place of the Holy of Holies, which is situatedbehind the veil, represented by heavenly (\u000b\f\u0017\u0007\u0005)42or terrestrial (\u0013\u0015\u0007\u0005)curtains. Metatron’s service behind the heavenly curtain parallels theunique function of the earthly high priest who alone was allowed toenter behind the veil of the terrestrial sanctuary.43It has been men-tioned that the possible background of this unique role of Metatron can383En.8.1: “R. Ishmael said: Metatron, Prince of the Divine Presence, said to me:BeforetheHolyOne,blessedbehe,setmetoservethethroneofglory....”(Alexander,“3Enoch,”262).

Gordon, “Aramaic Magical Bowls in the Istanbul and BaghdadMuseums,”Archiv Orientálni6(1934)319–334(328).39Alexander, “3Enoch,”303.40On the title “Youth” in the Hekhalot literature, see Davila, “Melchizedek, the‘Youth,’ and Jesus,”254–266, and Halperin,Faces of the Chariot,491–494.41Cf., for example,Synopse385:“whenthe youth enters beneath the throne of glory(\r\u0004\u0015\u0004\u000b\f\u0016\u0015\u0006\u000e\r\u0015\u0013\u0011\u0013\u000f\u0007\u0004\u0006)” (Schäfer,Synopse,p.162). Another text preserved in theCairoGenizahalso depicts the “youth” as emerging from his sacerdotal place in the immediatePresence of the deity: “Now, see the youth, who is going forth to meet youfrom behindthethroneofglory. Do not bow down to him, because his crown is like the crownof his King...” (P.

This depiction also cor-relates with the Hekhalot evidence according to which only the Youth,that is, Metatron, similarly to the earthly high priest, is allowed toserve before as well as behind the heavenly veil. The inscription on oneMandean bowl describes Metatron as the attendant “who serves beforethe Curtain.”44Philip Alexander observes that this definition “may belinked to the Hekhalot tradition about Metatron as the heavenly HighPriest ... and certainly alludes to his status as ‘Prince of the DivinePresence.’”45It is true that Metatron’s role as the Prince of the DivinePresence or the Prince of the Face (Sar ha-Panim) cannot be separatedfrom his priestly and liturgical duties since both the tabernacle of thisexalted angel and the divine liturgy that he is conducting are situated inthe immediate proximity to God’s Presence, also known as his Face. Inrelation to our investigation of the liturgical imagery, it is worth notingthat by virtue of being God’sSar ha-PanimYouth-Metatron can uncon-ditionally approach the Presence of the deity without harm for himself,a unique privilege denied to the rest of the created order. He is alsoallowed to go behind the Curtain and behold the Face of God,46as wellas to hear the voice of the deity. This is why he is able to protect thehayyotagainst the harmful effects of the Divine Presence in the courseof the angelic liturgy. Such imagery points to the fact that Metatron’sbold approach to the Divine Presence is predetermined, not only by hisspecial role as the celestial High Priest, but also by his privileges in theoffice of the Prince of the Divine Presence.It should be noted that, in contrast to the early Enochic traditionswhich hesitate to name explicitly the exalted patriarch as the highpriest, the Merkabah materials directly apply this designation to Meta-tron. Rachel Elior observes that Metatron appears in theGenizahdocu-ments as a high priest who offers sacrifices on the heavenly altar.47Shedraws attention to the important testimony attested in oneCairo Genizahtext which labels Metatron as the high priest and the chief of the priests.The text reads:44W.S.

Elisha, to whom Metatron serves as anangelus interpres. In view of Enoch-Metatron sacerdotal affiliations, it isnot coincidental that Rabbi Ishmael is the tanna who is attested in b.Ber.7a as a high priest.49R. Elior observes that inHekhalot Rabbatithisrabbinic authority is portrayed in terms similar to those used in theTalmud, that is, as a priest burning an offering on the altar.50OtherHekhalot materials, including3Enoch,51also often refer to R. Ishmael’spriestly origins. The priestly features of this visionary might not onlyreflect the heavenly priesthood of Metatron52but also allude to theformer priestly duties of the patriarch Enoch known from1EnochandJubilees, since some scholars note that “3Enochpresents a significantparallelism between the ascension of Ishmael and the ascension ofEnoch.”5348L.H.

The passages from3Enoch15BandSynopse§390that began our investigation show that oneof the features of Metatron’s service in the heavenly realm involves hisleadership over the angelic hosts delivering heavenly praise to the deity.Metatron is portrayed there not just as a servant in the celestial taber-nacle or the heavenly high priest, but also as the leader of the heavenlyliturgy. The evidences that unfold Metatron’s liturgical role are not con-fined solely to the Hekhalot corpus, but can also be detected in anotherprominent literary stream associated with early Jewish mysticism whichis represented by theShi#ur Qomahmaterials. The passages found in theShi#ur Qomahtexts attest to a familiar tradition in which Metatron isposited as a liturgical servant. Thus,Sefer Haqqomah155–164reads:And (the) angels who are with him come and encircle the Throne ofGlory. They are on one side and the (celestial) creatures are on the otherside, and the Shekhinah is on the Throne of Glory in the center. Andone creature goes up over the seraphim and descends on the tabernacleof the lad whose name is Metatron and says in a great voice, a thinvoice of silence, “The Throne of Glory is glistening!” Immediately, theangels fall silent and thecirinand theqadushinare still.

And the lad calls Him, “the great, mightyand awesome, noble, strong, powerful, pure and holy, and the strong andprecious and worthy, shining and innocent, beloved and wondrous andexalted and supernal and resplendent God.”55In reference to these materials M. Cohen notes that in theShi#ur Qomahtradition Metatron’s service in the heavenly tabernacle appears to be“entirely liturgical” and “is more the heavenly choirmaster and beadlethan the celestial high priest.”56It is evident that the tradition preserved inSefer Haqqomahcannotbe separated from the microforms found inSynopse390and3Enoch15B since all these narratives are unified by a similar structure andterminology. All of them also emphasize the Youth’s leading role in thecourse of the celestial service. It is also significant that Metatron’s roleas the one who is responsible for the protection and encouragement ofthe servants delivering praise to the deity is not confined only to theaforementioned passages, but finds support in the broader context ofthe Hekhalot andShi#ur Qomahmaterials.57Thus, in the Hekhalot corpus, Metatron’s duties as the choirmas-ter or the celestial liturgical director appear to be applied, not onlyto his leadership over angelic hosts, but also over humans, specificallythe visionaries who are lucky enough to overcome the angelic opposi-tion and be admitted into the heavenly realm. In3En.1.9–10Enoch-Metatron is depicted as the one who “prepares” one of such visionaries,Rabbi Ishmael, for singing praise to the Holy One:At once Metatron, Prince of the Divine Presence, came and revived meandraisedmetomyfeet,butstillIhadnostrengthenoughtosingahymn before the glorious throne of the glorious King...5855Cohen,The Shi#ur Qomah: Texts and Recensions,162–164.

Thus,Daniel Abrams notes that inSefer ha-Hashek“Metatron commands the angels to praisethe King of the Glory, and he is among them.” Abrams, “The Boundaries of DivineOntology,”304.58Alexander, “3Enoch,”256. Peter Schäfer suggests that Ishmael’s example stresses"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"214the enoch traditionIt is possible that these descriptions of Enoch-Metatron as the onewho encourages angels and humans to perform heavenly praise infront of God’s Presence might have their roots in early Second Templematerials. Our investigation must now turn to analyzing some of theseearly developments that might constitute the early background of theMerkabah liturgical imagery.The Beginnings: Liturgical Role of Enoch in Slavonic ApocalypseOne of the texts which might contain early traces of Enoch-Metatron’sliturgical imagery is2(Slavonic) Enoch, the Jewish apocalypse, appar-ently written in the first century CE. In contrast to other early Enochicmaterials, such as1EnochandJubilees, which emphasize only one sideof the patriarch’s heavenly service through the reference to Enoch’spriestly activities, the Slavonic text appears to encompass both sacer-dotal dimensions—priestly as well as liturgical. Allusions to the priestlyoffice of the seventh antediluvian hero in the Slavonic text demonstratemarked difference in comparison with the testimonies found in1EnochandJubilees. Thus, unlike the aforementioned Enochic tracts,2Enochdoes not associate the translated patriarch with any celestial structurethat might remotely resemble the descriptions found in1Enoch14and87. On the other hand, the Slavonic text contains a number of otherindirect testimonies that demonstrate that the authors of this apoca-lypse were cognizant of the patriarch’s priestly role. Thus, scholars pre-viously observed that Enoch’s anointing with shining oil and his cloth-ing into the luminous garments during his angelic metamorphosis in2Enoch22appear to resemble the priestly vesture.59Another possiblesacerdotal association comes from2Enoch67–69where the descendentsof the seventh antediluvian patriarch, including his son Methuselah,are depicted as the builders of the altar which is erected on the placewhere Enoch was taken up to heaven. The choice of the location forthe terrestrial sanctuary might allude to the peculiar role of the patri-arch in relation to the heavenly counterpart of this earthly structure.the connection between heavenly and earthly liturgies; cf. Schäfer,The Hidden andManifest God,132.59M. Himmelfarb observes that “the combination of clothing and anointing sug-gests that the process by which Enoch becomes an angel is a heavenly version ofpriestly investiture” (M. Himmelfarb,Ascent to Heaven in Jewish and Christian Apocalypses[New York, Oxford: Oxford University Press,1993],40)."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"the liturgical role of enoch-metatron215The Slavonic text also appears to refer to the sacerdotal office of Enochby portraying the patriarch as the one who in2Enoch59delivers thesacrificial instructions to his children. All these testimonies show that2Enoch’s authors were familiar with the traditions about the priestlyaffiliations of the seventh antediluvian hero attested also in the earlyEnochic booklets. However, in contrast to these early materials thatmention only Enoch’s priestly role, the authors of the Slavonic apoca-lypse also appear to have knowledge about another prominent office ofthe translated patriarch—his liturgical activities and his role as the onewho encourages and directs the celestial hosts in their daily praise ofthe creator.Entertaining this possibility of the Enochic origins of Metatron’s roleas the leader of the divine worship, we must direct our attention to thepassage found in2Enoch18where the patriarch is depicted as the onewho encourages the celestial Watchers to conduct liturgy before theface of God. The longer recension of2En.18.8–9relates:And I [Enoch] said, “Why are you waiting for your brothers? And whydon’t youperform the liturgy60beforethefaceoftheLord?Startupyourliturgy,61and perform the liturgy before the face of the Lord, so thatyou do not enrage your Lord to the limit.” And they responded to myrecommendation, and they stood in four regiments in this heaven. Andbehold, while I was standing with those men,4trumpets trumpetedin unison with a great sound, and the Watchers burst into singing inunison. And their voice rose in front of the face of the Lord, piteouslyand touchingly.62One can notice that the imagery of this account represents a vaguesketch that only distantly alludes to the future prominent liturgicalrole of Enoch-Metatron. Yet here, for the first time in the Enochictradition, the seventh antediluvian patriarch dares to assemble anddirect the angelic creatures for their routine job of delivering praise tothe deity. The choice of the angelic group, of course, is not coincidentalsince in various Enochic materials the patriarch is often described as a60Slav.sluæite. M.I.

This peculiar terminologyinvolving the symbolism of fire appears to allude to the concepts foundin the aforementioned Hekhalot liturgical accounts where the imageryof fire, in the form of the references to thedeafening fireand angels“bathing” in the fire, plays an important role. The shorter recensionalso stresses the importance of Enoch’s leading role, specifically under-scoring that the angels needed “the earnestness” of his recommenda-tion.65The reference of2Enoch18to the later Youth-Metatron office as theheavenly choirmaster does not appear to be happenstance, since theSlavonic apocalypse alludes to some additional features that recall thelater Merkabah liturgical developments. The present study will concen-trate on two of such characteristics that enhance Enoch’s connectionwith his newly acquired liturgical office.BothofthemarelinkedtoEnoch-Metatron’s designations, namely, his titles as “Youth” and the“Servant of the Divine Presence,” which appear here for the first timein the Enochic tradition.

Our study must now proceed to the investigation ofthese two titles in2Enoch’smaterials.63The shorter recension of2En.18.8–9reads: “‘And why don’t you perform theliturgy before the face of the Lord? Start up the former liturgy. Perform the liturgy inthenameoffire(vo imja ogne), lest you annoy the Lord your God (so that), he throws youdown from this place.’ And they heeded the earnestness of my recommendation, andthey stood in four regiments in heaven.

It isnot surprising that in2Enoch, which attests to the origins of Enoch-Metatron’s liturgical imagery, one can also find for the first time in theEnochic tradition an explicit reference to the patriarch’s role as theServant of the Divine Presence.66Hugo Odeberg may well be the first scholar to have discovered thecharacteristics of “the Prince of the Presence” in the long recensionof2Enoch. He successfully demonstrated in his synopsis of the parallelpassages from2and3Enochthat the phrase “stand before my faceforever” found in the Slavonic apocalypse does not serve there merelyas a typical Hebraism, “to be in the presence,” but establishes theangelic status of Enoch as Metatron, the Prince of the Presence,\u0007\b\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006.67In2Enochtherefore the patriarch is depicted not as one of thevisonaries who has only temporary access to the Divine Presence, butas an angelic servant permanently installed in the office of theSar ha-Panim. The title itself is developed primarily in chs.21–22,whicharedevoted to the description of the Throne of Glory. In these chapters,one can find several promises coming from the mouth of archangelGabriel and the deity himself that the translated patriarch will nowstand in front God’s face forever.68In terms of the theological background of the problem, the titleseems to be connected with the image of Metatron in the Merkabahtradition,69which was crystallized in the classical Hekhalot literature.7066Although the imagery of angels of the Presence was widespread in the pseudepi-graphical writings and specifically in the early Enochic pseudepigrapha, it was neverexplicitly identified with the seventh antediluvian patriarch.1En.40:9, however, men-tions the four “Faces” or “Presences” of Ezek.1:6identifying them with the four princi-pal angels: Michael, Phanuel, Raphael, and Gabriel.67Odeberg,3Enoch,55.68Cf.2En.21:3: “And the Lord send one of his glorious ones, the archangel Gabriel.And he said to me ‘Be brave, Enoch! Don’t be frightened! Stand up, and come with meand stand in front of the face of the Lord forever.’”2En.22:6:“AndtheLordsaidtohisservants, sounding them out: ‘Let Enoch join in and stand in front of my face forever!’”2En.36:3: “Because a place has been prepared for you, and you will be in front of myface from now and forever” (Andersen, “2Enoch,”136,138,161).69Scholem,Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism,67.70On the debates about the various stages in the development of the Merkabahtradition, see Alexander, “The Historical Setting of the Hebrew Book of Enoch,”173–"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"218the enoch traditionAccording to the legend of the Hekhalot tradition, Enoch “was raisedto the rank of first of the angels and\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007\b(literally, ‘Prince of theDivine Face,’ or ‘Divine Presence’).”713Enoch, as well as other textsof Hekhalot tradition, have a well-developed theology connected withthis title.YouthIt has been already shown that in the descriptions related to Meta-tron’s sacerdotal and liturgical duties he often appears under the title“Youth.” Such persistence of the Hekhalot writers who repeatedly con-nect this designation with Metatron’s priestly and liturgical service maybe explained by one of the possible meanings of the Hebrew term\u0007\u0004,which also can be translated as “servant.” It should be stressed that thesobriquet “Youth” is never applied to designate the seventh patriarchin1Enoch,Jubilees,Genesis Apocryphon,andtheBook of Giants. Yet, it issignificant that in some manuscripts ofSlavonic Enochfor the first timein the Enochic tradition the seventh antediluvian patriarch becomesassociated with this prominent Metatron’s title.72Despite the fact that180; David J.

The variantjenokhuis rare.There is no phonetic reason why the first vowel should change toju;junokhuis never found. But it cannot be a coincidence that this title isidentical with that of Enoch (= Metatron) in3Enoch.75The employment of the designation “Youth” in the Slavonic apoca-lypse cannot be separated from its future usage in the later Merkabahmaterials, since the context of the usage of the sobriquet is very simi-lar in both traditions. Thus, according to the Merkabah tradition, Godlikes to address Enoch-Metatron as “Youth.” In3Enoch3,whenR.Ish-mael asks Metatron, “What is your name?” Metatron answers, “I haveseventy names, corresponding to the seventy nations of the world ...however, my King calls me ‘Youth.’”76The designation of the trans-lated patriarch as “Youth” seems to signify here a special relationshipbetween the deity and Metatron. One can see the beginning of this tra-dition already in2Enochwhere in ch.24of the shorter recension thefollowing tradition can be found:AndtheLordcalledme(Enoch)andheplacedmetohimselfcloserthanGabriel. And I did obeisance to the Lord. And the Lord spoke to me“Whatever you see, Youth, things standing still and moving about werebrought to perfection by me and not even to angels have I explained mysecrets...as I am making them known to you today...”7773Professor Francis Andersen reassured me in a private communication about theoriginality of this reading, referring to it as “powerful evidence.”74See, for example, §§384,385,390,396in Schäfer,Synopse,162–163,164–165,166–167.75Andersen, “2Enoch,”118–119.76Alexander, “3Enoch,”257.77Sokolov, “Materialy i zametki po starinnoj slavjanskoj literature,”90–91;Ander-sen, “2Enoch,”119."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"220the enoch traditionIt is significant that the title “Youth” here is tied to the motif ofEnoch’s superiority over angels and his leading role in the celestialcommunity which will play later a prominent role in the Merkabahliturgical accounts. It is possible that the title “Youth” also signifieshere Enoch’s role as a very special servant of the deity who has im-mediate access to God’s Presence which is even closer than that ofthe archangels. In this context it is not surprising that in the shorterrecension of2En.24.1–2the patriarch is depicted as the one who hasthe seat left78of the Lord, “closer than Gabriel,” that is, next to God.Finally, we must note that several important readings of “Youth”in the materials associated withSlavonic Enochcan be found in theVienna Codex.79In this manuscript Enoch is addressed by the Lordas “Youth”80in the context of angelic veneration. The passage from2Enoch22of the Vienna Codex reads:And the Lord with his own mouth called me [Enoch] and said: Be brave,Yo u t h !81Do not be frightened! Stand up in front of my face forever. AndMichael, the Lord’sarchistratig, brought me in the front of the Lord’s face.And the Lord tempted his servants and said to them: “Let Enoch comeup and stand in the front of my face forever.” And the glorious onesbowed down and said: “Let him come up!”82This veneration of the Youth by the heavenly hosts in the context ofGod’s speech recalls the liturgical accounts found inSynopse390andSefer Haqqomahwhere the angelic hosts prostrate themselves before theYouth in the Presence of the deity allowing the exalted angel to insertthe fire of deafness into their ears. It is not coincidental that scholarspreviously pointed to the liturgical coloring of this scene from2Enoch22where the patriarch changes his earthly garments for the luminousattire which now closely resembles the priestly vesture.8378The assigning of the left side to the vice-regent might be seen as puzzling. MartinHengel, however, rightly observes that this situation can be explained as the correctionof the Christian scribe(s), who “reserved this place for Christ” (M. Hengel,Studies in Ear-ly Christology[Edinburg: T.&T. Clark,1995],193). Hengel points to a similar situation intheAscension of Isaiahwhere the angel of the holy spirit is placed at the left hand of God.79I want to express my deep gratitude to Professor Francis Andersen who gener-ously shared with me the microfilms and photographs of MSS V, R, and J.80Unfortunately, Friedrich Repp’s research on the Vienna Codex failed to discernthe proper meaning of “Youth” in this important manuscript.

Scholars have previouslynoted that Enoch’s figure portrayed in the various sections of2Enochappears to be more complex than in the early Enochic tractates of1Enoch.84For the first time, the Enochic tradition seeks to depict Enoch,not simply as a human taken to heaven and transformed into anangel, but as a celestial being exalted above the angelic world. Inthis attempt, one may find the origins of another image of Enoch,very different from the early Enochic literature, which was developedmuch later in Merkabah mysticism—the concept of the supreme angelMetatron, the “Prince of the Presence.”85Theattestationoftheseventhantediluvian patriarch as the celestial liturgical director in2Enochgivesadditional weight to this hypothesis about the transitional nature ofthe Slavonic account which guides the old pseudepigraphical traditionsinto the new mystical dimension. In this respect the tradition foundin2Enoch18might represent an important step towards defining andshaping Enoch-Metatron’s liturgical office in its transition to his newrole as the celestial choirmaster.86It is also significant that the beginningof Enoch’s liturgical functions in2Enochis conflated there with thedevelopment of his new titles-offices as the Youth and the Servant of theDivine Presence which will later play a prominent role in the Merkabahpassages pertaining to Metatron’s liturgical actions.84Alexander, “From Son of Adam to a Second God,”102–104; Odeberg,3Enoch,52–63.85P. Alexander observes that “the transformation of Enoch in2Enoch22providesthe closest approximation, outside Merkabah literature, to Enoch’s transformation in3Enoch3–13” (Alexander, “3Enoch,”248).86It is intriguing that a similar or maybe even competing development can bedetected in the early lore about Yahoel. Thus,Apoc. Abr.10:9depicts Yahoel as theone who is responsible for teaching “those who carry the song through the mediumof man’s night of the seventh hour” (R. Rubinkiewicz, “Apocalypse of Abraham,” inOTP,1.694).

Earliest traces of theMerkabah tradition are situated in apocalyptic and Qumran literature. However, asGruenwald notes, the main corpus of the Merkabah literature was composed in Israelin the period200–700CE. Some references to this tradition can be found also inthe literature of German Hasidim (twelfth to thirteenth centuries CE) and medievalKabbalistic writings (theZohar).The term “Hekhalot” (“Divine Palaces”) designates the corpus of literature that firstgives a full-scale presentation of Merkabah mysticism (the beginning of the tradition isconnected with the circle of Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai and his pupils). According toGruenwald the main subjects dealt with in the Hekhaloth literature are heavenly ascen-sions and the revelation of cosmological secrets. I. Gruenwald,Apocalyptic and MerkavahMysticism(AGAJU,14; Leiden: Brill,1980). The term “Merkabah” (the “Chariot”) canbe used also in its technical Kabbalistic meaning as the link between the physical andthe divine worlds or as one of the upper worlds.

And I compared every measure and the just balance Imeasured.9An important aspect of both passages is the Slavonic termp(r)ometaÿ(prometaya), which follows Enoch’s title, “The Governor of the World.”10This term was deliberately left in its original Slavonic form in order topreserve its authentic phonetic image.Prometayarepresents an etymo-logical enigma for experts in Slavonic, since it is found solely in the textof2Enoch. It should be stressed again that there is no other Slavonictext where the wordprometayais documented.The prominent Russian linguist I. Sreznevskij, in his Slavonic dictio-nary, which is still considered by scholars as a primary tool of Slavonicetymology, was unable to provide a definition forprometaya.11He sim-ply put a question mark in the space for the meaning for the word.12The variety of readings for this term in the manuscripts of2Enoch13shows similar “linguistic embarrassment” among Slavic scribes whomost likely had some difficulties discerning the meaning of this ambigu-ous term. The readings of other manuscripts includepromitaya, prometae-maa, pometaya, pametaa.One possible explanation for the singular occurrence ofprometayaisthat the word may actually be a Greek term that was left untranslatedin the original text for some unknown reason. In fact,2Enochcontainsa number of transliterated Hebrew and Greek words preserved in theiroriginal phonetic form (e.g.,Grigori, Ophanim, Raqia Araboth). But if weinvestigate the termprometayamore closely, the rootmetadraws ourattention nesessitating further examination of the relationship betweenthe wordsprometayaandmetatron.Contemporary scholarship does not furnish a consensus concerningthe origin of the name “Metatron.” In scholarly literature, there areseveral independent hypotheses about the provenance of the term.9Andersen, “2Enoch,”217–219.10Andersen translates the title as “the manager of the arrangements on earth.”Andersen, “2Enoch,”217.11On the other hand, Vaillant in his edition states thatprometayacould be identifiedas a rare verb corresponding to the Greek\u0014ασαν\u000e+ων. The linguistic source of thissuggestion remains unknown. Andersen criticizes this translation, pointing out thatthe meaning is not quite suitable and does not correspond to earlier materials. SeeAndersen, “2Enoch,”217.12“promitati,promitaÿ(promitati, promitaja)—?” I.I. Sreznevskij,Slovar’ drevnerus-skogo jazyka(Moscow: Kniga,1989),2.1544.13Andersen stresses that the variations show “theological embarassment” among theSlavic scribes (“2Enoch,”217)."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"the origin of the name“metatron”227I want to draw our attention to one possible interpretation, whichcould be connected with some materials in2Enoch.Accordingtothisinterpretation, the name “Metatron” may be derived from the Greekwordμ\u0015τρ\u0011ν(measure, rule). Adolf Jellinek may well be the first scholarwho suggestedμ\u0015τρ\u0011νas an alternative explanation of Metatron, onthe assumption that Metatron was identical with Horos.14GedaliahuStroumsa in his article, “Forms of God: Some Notes on Metatron andChrist,” gives some convincing new reasons for the acceptance of thisetymology, on the basis that Metatron not only carried God’s name,but also measured Him; he was HisShi#ur Qomah(the measurementof the Divine Body).15In light of this observation, Stroumsa stressesthat “renewed attention should be given toμ\u0015τρ\u0011νand/ormetatoras apossible etymology of Metatron.”16Matthew Black, in his short article devoted to the origin of thename Metatron, expounds upon an additional etymological facet ofthis interpretation of the name. He traces the origin of the name to apreviously unnoticed piece of evidence which can be found in Philo’s17Quaest. in Gen., where, among other titles of the Logos, Black finds thetermpraemetitor.18He further suggests thatpraemetitorcould be traced tothe Greek termμετρητ\u001fς,19the Greek equivalent of the Latinmetator,“measurer,” applied to the Logos.20The termpraemetitorin its hypothetical meaning as a “measurer”is an important piece of evidence because it is almost phoneticallyidentical with the Slavonic termprometaya.Additionally, the termprometayais incorporated into the passagewhich describes Enoch as the Measurer of the Lord. In ch.43of2Enoch, immediately after the use of this term, Enoch makes the fol-lowing statement:14Odeberg,3Enoch,134.15G.G. Stroumsa, “Form(s) of God: Some Notes on Metatron and Christ,”HTR76(1983)287.16Stroumsa, “Form(s) of God,”287.17The idea that the Metatron figure originally came into Judaism from Philo’s Logosspeculations was popular in German scholarship of the19th century.

Possible hypo-thetical Greek prototypes ofprometayacould beπρ\u0011μ\u001f,εια(πρ\u0011μη,ε!ς,πρ\u0011μη,\u0015\u0011μαι), in the sense of protection, care, or providence, whichcould be directly related to the preceding title of Enoch—the Governor,or the Guide of the earth—“I am the Governor of the earth,prometaya,Ihavewrittenthemdown.”In conclusion, it is important to note thatprometayacould representa very early, rudimentary form of the title that later was transformedinto the term “metatron.” In relation to this, Gershom Scholem, inhis analysis of the term “metatron,” shows that the reduplication ofthe lettertet(\u0019\u0019) and the endingronrepresent a typical pattern thatruns through all Merkabah texts. In his opinion, “both the ending andthe repetition of the consonant are observable, for instance, in nameslike Zoharariel and Adiriron.”28Further, he stresses that it must alsobe borne in mind thatonandronmay have been fixed and typicalconstituents of secret names rather than meaningful syllables.29Thus, keeping in mind the possible date of2Enochin the first centuryof the common era before the destruction of the Second Temple,prometayacould be one of the earliest traces connecting the namesEnoch and Metatron.3027Andersen, “2Enoch,”219.28Scholem,Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism,69.29Scholem,Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism,69–70.30On the hypothetical date of2Enochsee: Scholem,Jewish Gnosticism, MerkabahMysticism and Talmudic Tradition(New York: The Jewish Theological Seminary,1965),17; Gruenwald,Apocalyptic and Merkavah Mysticism,50."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"RESURRECTION OF ADAM’S BODY:THE REDEEMING ROLE OFENOCH-METATRON IN2 (SLAVONIC) ENOCH1In2Enoch, a Jewish apocalypse written in the first century CE, a hintabout the angelic status of its hero is expressed through his refusal toparticipate in a family meal.

Since the time when the Lord anointed me with the oint-ment of his glory, food has not come into me, and earthly pleasure mysoul does not remember, nor do I desire anything earthly.2The important feature of this passage from the Slavonic apocalypseis the theme of the “ointment of glory,” a luminous substance whichtransformed the former family man into a celestial creature who is nolonger able to enjoy earthly food.

It is also significant that the oil appears here to be synonymouswith the Glory of the Deity since the longer recension of2Enoch56describes the oil as the “ointment of the Lord’s glory.” In this respect itshould not be forgotten that Enoch’s embrocation with shining oil takesplace in front the Lord’s glorious extent, labeled in2Enochas the DivineFace. The patriarch’s anointing therefore can be seen as covering withGlory coming from the DivineKavod.At this point it must be noted that several manuscripts of the shorterrecension bring some problematic discrepancies to this seamless arrayof theological motifs pertaining to the patriarch’s anointing. They insistthat the patriarch was anointed not with ointment of the Lord’s glorybut instead with the ointment coming from Enoch’s head. Thus twomanuscripts of the shorter recension (AandU) insist that the patriarchwas anointed not with ointment ofthe Lord’s glorybut instead with theointment coming from Enoch’s head.The passage from chapter56attested in the manuscriptsAandUreads: “Since the time when the Lord anointed me with the ointmentof my [Enoch’s] head (elýem[ glavy moe«)... .”4This tradition which describes the miraculous power of the oil com-ing from the head of the main character of the text appears to be quitepuzzling. Yet in the light of the later Jewish materials this motif aboutthe transforming substance coming from the head of the celestial crea-ture might not be entirely incomprehensible. For example, inPirke deRabbi Eliezer34one learns that the reviving dew, a rabbinic metaphorfor the oil of the resurrection, will come at the eschatological time fromthe head of the Deity:RabbiTanchumsaid:Onaccountoftheseedoftheearth,whenitiscommanded, (it) discharges the dew for the resurrection of the dead.From what place does it descend? From the head of the Holy One; forthe head of the Holy One, is full of the reviving dew. In the future life theHoly One, will shake His head and cause the quickening dew to descend,4M.I.

TheZohar1:130b–131a reads:And at the time when the Holy One will raise the dead to life He willcause dew to descend upon them from His head. By means of that dewall will rise from the dust... . For the tree of life emanates life unceasinglyinto the universe.6Both passages about the reviving dew, as well as the tradition found in2Enoch22, might have their earlier background in Psalm133:2–3wherethe precious oil running down on the head (\u000b\u0007\u0003\b\u000e\u0007\u0006\u000f\u0016\f\u0019\u0006\u0018\u0012\b\u0015)ofAaron is compared with the dew of the eternal life sent by the Deity.Ye t2Enoch’saccounts about the oil of anointing appear to emphasizenot only the priestly but also the eschatological role of the translatedpatriarch who is predestined to play an important part in redemptionof humanity from the sin of the Protoplast.The question remains, however, how the traditions about the dew ofresurrection coming from the Deity’s head are related to the problem-atic readings postulating that the resurrection oil is coming not from thehead of the Lord but instead from the head of Enoch. The confusionbetween the head of the seer and the Deity’s head, God’s oil and the oilof Enoch, the glory of the Lord and the glory of the exalted patriarchreflected in Slavonic text, does not appear to be coincidental. It seemsto reflect a significant theological tendency of the text where Enoch’sheavenly “persona” is understood as the “replica” of the DivineKavod,in front of which the visionary was recreated as a heavenly being. Thesimilarities between the two celestial corporealities—The DivineKavodand the newly acquired celestial extent of Enoch-Metatron, which insome traditions serves as the measurement of the divine body—havebeen previously explored in several important studies. This presentationhowever seeks to address another eschatological dimension in whichEnoch’s new identity is connected with his new role as the redeemer ofhumanity who is able to reverse the sin of Adam.

The people who came to bowdown before the patriarch delivered to Enoch the following address:O our father, Enoch! May you be blessed by the Lord, the eternal king!And now, bless your sons, and all the people, so that we may be glorifiedin front of your face today. For you will be glorified in front of the faceof the Lord for eternity, because you are the one whom the Lord chosein preference to all the people upon the earth; and he appointed you tobe the one who makes a written record of all his creation, visible andinvisible, and the one who carried away the sin of humankind (2Enoch64:4–5).107P.

But what kind of sin was Enochable to carry away? Can it be merely related to Enoch’s role as anintercessor for humans at the time of the final judgment? In this respectit is important that in2Enoch64the “elders of the earth” define Enoch,not as the one who will carry away the sin of humankind, but asthe one who has already carried away this sin. The emphasis on thealready accomplished redemptive act provides an important clue tounderstanding the kind of sin Enoch was able to erase. The focushere is not on the individual sins of Enoch’s descendents but on theprimeval sin of humankind. Therefore, it becomes apparent that theredeeming functions of the patriarch are not related to his possibleintercession for the sins of his children, the fallen angels or the “eldersof the earth.” Rather they pertain to the sin of the protoplast which thepatriarch was able to “carry away” by his righteousness, ascension, andtransformation. Yet Enoch’s role in the economy of human salvationis not confined solely to his past encounter of the Face of God. Inthe Slavonic apocalypse he himself becomes a redeemer who is ableto cause the transformation of human subjects. The significant detailof the aforementioned account in chapter64that unfolds Enoch’sredeeming functions is that the same people who proclaim the patriarchas the redeemer of humanity now also find themselves prostrated beforeEnoch asking for his blessing so that they may be glorified in front ofhis face.2Enoch64tells:And the elders of the people and all the community came and prostratedthemselves and kissed Enoch. And they said to him, “O our father,Enoch! May you be blessed by the Lord, the eternal king! And now,bless your sons, and all the people, so that we may be glorified in front ofyour face today.”11This depiction recalls the earlier scene of the patriarch’s approach totheKavodin2Enoch22where the visionary is depicted as prostratedbefore the Divine Face during his account of transformation. Theonly difference here is that instead of the Divine Face people arenow approaching the Face of Enoch.

For theLord has chosen you, to appoint you to be the one who reveals, whocarries away our sins.”12In light of these theological developments taking place in the Slavonicapocalypse where the patriarch assumes the role of redeemer whoseface is able to glorify human subjects, it is not coincidental that somemanuscripts of2Enochconfuse the glory of the Deity with the gloryof the patriarch and the oil of the Lord with the oil of Enoch’s head.These readings therefore appear to be not simply scribal slips but delib-erate theological reworking in which Enoch’s oil might be understoodas having the same redeeming and transformative value as the oil of theLord.122Enoch64:3–4(the shorter recension).

This assumption issimply incorrect. There is nothing Christian in these two verses. They are presentedin both recensions in all major MSS of2Enoch. A simple comparison of two recen-sions provides additional proof that it is not an interpolation. In the shorter recensionan interpolation in71:34–36is absent. If71:32–33also belongs to this interpolation itis difficult to explain why these verses are still preserved in the shorter recension. Itshould be noted that previous translators A. Vaillant and F.

This chapter, therefore, will seek to investigate theAdamic polemics in2Enoch, one of the most important polemical devel-opments taking place in the Slavonic apocalypse; this polemical devel-opment, unfortunately, completely escaped Böttrich’s attention.5By thisinvestigation I will try to demonstrate that the polemics permeate thewhole text and that without consideration of them any research on2Enochends inevitably in a blind alley.The Function of the Adamic Tradition in2EnochAdam’s story occupies a prominent place in2Slavonic (Apocalypse of)Enoch. The traditions pertaining to the first human can be found in allthe sections of the book.6In these materials Adam is depicted as a glo-rious angelic being, predestined by God to be the ruler of the earth, butfalling short of God’s expectations. Although a major bulk of Adamicmaterials belongs to the longer recension, which includes, for example,the lengthy Adamic narrative in chapters30–32, the Adamic traditionis not confined solely to this recension. A number of important Adamicpassages are also attested in the shorter recension. The extensive pres-ence of Adamic materials in both recensions and their significance for5It is remarkable that Böttrich’s book dedicated to the Adamic tradition in2Enoch[C. Böttrich,Adam als Microkosmos(Judentum und Umwelt,59; Berlin: Peter Lang,1995)] does not have even one word on the polemical nature of the Adamic narrative inthe Slavonic apocalypse. The question of the influence of the Adamic tradition on theimage of Enoch is also completely ignored.62Enoch30:8–32:2;33:10;41:1;42:5;44:1;58:1–3;71:28."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"on the polemical nature of2(slavonic)enoch241the theology of the Slavonic apocalypse indicates that they are not laterinterpolations but are part of the original layer of the text.It should be noted that such an extensive presence of Adamic mate-rials in the intertestamental Enochic text is quite unusual. In the earlyEnochic circle, included in the composition known as1(Ethiopic) Enoch,Adam does not figure prominently. His presence in these materials ismarginal and limited to a few insignificant remarks. Besides these fewshort references to the first humans,7the early Enochic booklets aresilent about the traditions associated with the protoplast. Moreover,Adam’s image in1Enochis quite different from the one attested in theSlavonic apocalypse.1Enoch’smaterials do not give any specific detailsabout the elevated status of the protoplast. For example, theAnimalApocalypse(1Enoch85:3) depicts Adam as a white bull. Although white isa positive symbol in the imagery ofAn. Ap.,8scholars note that, in gen-eral, this allegory does not indicate goodness or elevation, but ratherlineage.9Thus, inAn. Ap. all the sheep are white, even the blinded ones.The white color, therefore, does not serve as a sign of the elevated orangelic status of the protoplast. Sethites, for instance, are also depictedas white bulls. If the authors or editors ofAn. Ap.wanttostresstheangelic status of a character, they usually depict it in transformationfrom an animal into a human. Thus, in Ethiopic and Aramaic versionsofAn. Ap.(1Enoch89:36), Moses is portrayed as the one who was trans-formed from a sheep into a man during his encounter with God onMount Sinai. Moses’ “humanization” points to his transition to angelicstatus. The same process can be found in the Ethiopic version ofAn.Ap.(1Enoch89:9) where Noah’s angelic metamorphosis is symbolicallydepicted as a transformation from a white bovid into a man.10Such“humanization,” however, was never applied to Adam inAn. Ap.The modest role which Adam plays in the early Enochic circlecan be explained by several factors. Scholars previously observed thatEnochic and Adamic traditions often offer contending explanations ofthe origin of evil in the world.11The Enochic tradition bases its under-7See,1Enoch32:6;37:1;60:8;69:9–11;85:3;90:37–38.8P.

It appears that thepurpose of the extensive presence of Adamic materials in2Enochcan beexplained through the assessment of Enoch’s image in the text.Scholars have previously noted that Enoch’s figure, portrayed in thevarious sections of2Enoch, is more complex than in the early Enochictractates of1Enoch.12For the first time, the Enochic tradition seeks todepict Enoch, not simply as a human taken to heaven and transformedinto an angel, but as a celestial being exalted above the angelic world.1312P.

Odeberg,3Enoch or theHebrew Book of Enoch(New York: KTAV,1973),52–63.13One can argue that the beginning of this process can be seen already in theBookof the Similitudeswhere Enoch seems to be identified with the Son of Man. It is possi-ble that theSimilitudes, written close to the time of2Enoch, also reflects this process oftransition to the new image of Enoch. In contrast to2Enoch,theSimilitudes,however,does not elaborate this process to the same degree as the Slavonic apocalypse does.Enoch’s transformation into the Son of Man in theSimilitudes71is rather instantaneousand ambiguous. In contrast, in2Enochthis process of Enoch’s transition to new super-angelic identity is described in detail through the expositions of Enoch’s celestial titleswhich unfold the patriarch’s new roles in numerous celestial offices.

In this text,Enoch acquired a whole host of roles and qualities which the Adamicnarrative of the Slavonic apocalypse associates with the protoplast. Inthe course of these polemical appropriations, the elevated angelic statusof the prelapsarian Adam, his luminosity, his wisdom, and his specialroles as the king of the earth and the steward of all earthly creaturesare transferred to the new occupant of the celestial realm, the patriarchEnoch, who, near the Lord’s throne, is transformed into one of theglorious ones initiated into the highest mysteries by the Lord, becomesthe “manager of the arrangements on the earth,” and writes down“everything that nourished” on it.Our further analysis will demonstrate that the traditions about theprelapsarian conditions of Adam provide an initial background for thepolemical appropriations.

At the end of hisdescription, Enoch delivers the following conclusion:Frightening and dangerous it is to stand before the face of the earthlyking, terrifying and very dangerous it is, because the will of the king isdeath and the will of the king is life.

It is not therefore coincidental that inthis situation some duties of Adam in his office of the king of the earthbecome also transferred to the new occupant of this office, the seventhantediluvian patriarch.

It appearsthat the depiction of Enoch as the governing power on earth represents an importantstep in shaping the new image of Enoch as the supreme angel elevated above theangelic world. The role of Enoch as the king/manager of earth in2Enochis, therefore,directly connected with the later Metatron title, the “Prince of the World,” found inthe Merkabah literature and on the incantation bowls from Babylonia. Cf. Alexander,“3Enoch,”1.229,1.243; C.H. Gordon, “Aramaic and Mandaic Magical Bowls,”ArOr9(1937)94–95. The Merkabah tradition stresses the role of Enoch-Metatron as thegoverning power over the nations, kingdoms, and rulers on earth. Chapter30of3Enochalludes to the role of Metatron as the Prince of the World, the leader of seventy-two princes of kingdoms in the world who speaks (pleads) in favor of the world beforethe Holy One ... every day at the hour when the book is opened in which every deedin the world is recorded. The depiction of Metatron as the “Prince of the World” in3Enochreveals several similarities to the royal status of Enoch in the Slavonic apocalypse.One of them is that in2Enoch64:1the patriarch delivers his address “to his sonsand tothe princes of the people.” The reference to the princes of the people is intriguingsince in3Enoch30Metatron is described as the leader of seventy-twoprincesof thekingdoms of the world. The second important similarity is that in both texts the role ofEnoch/Metatron as the governing power on earth is tied to his duties as the witness ofthe divine judgment. Both accounts, therefore, contain references to Enoch’s writingsrepresenting the record of all the deeds of every person.35Andersen,1.164–166.Inchapter43, the same picture can be observed.

Like Adam who “named” everything thatlives on the earth Enoch in his turn writes down “every seed on theearth.”36It is important that Enoch’s “stewardship” over the created order,akin to Adam’s duties, also includes the obligation to protect andcare for the animals. In2Enoch58–59, the protoplast’s responsibilitiespertaining to the animals are transferred to the seventh antediluvianpatriarch and his descendants.It is noteworthy that both accounts, the story of Adam’s naming ofanimals and Enoch’s instructions to his children about the protectionof animals, are located in the same chapter of the Slavonic apoca-lypse.2Enoch58depicts the Lord summoning all creatures of the earthand bringing them before Adam that the first human might namethem. This story then continues with Enoch’s instructions to his chil-dren about the special care for animals whose souls will testify againsthuman beings at the great judgment if they treat them unjustly. Thisaccount, which substitutes one steward of God’s earthly creatures foranother, fits perfectly into the pattern of the Adamic polemics found inthe Slavonic apocalypse.InWeltweisheit, Menschheitsethik, Urkult, C.

Stone’s illuminating studyreveals that the argument with the Adamic tradition in the Slavonicapocalypse includes, not only the internal debates based on2Enoch’sdepictions of the protoplast, but also the intertextual polemics withthe Adamic traditions attested in the primary Adam books.40The factthat these Adamic traditions are already re-written in the Slavonicapocalypse, as the deeds and functions of the protoplast are transferredto Enoch without any reference to their original “proprietor,” servesas strong evidence to the scope of the polemical intentions of2Enoch’sauthors.M. Stone’s article investigates an important motif preserved in chap-ters21–22of the Slavonic apocalypse. The story depicts angels bringingEnoch to the edge of the seventh heaven. By the Lord’s command, thearchangel Gabriel invites the patriarch to stand in front of the Lord for-ever. Enoch agrees and archangel Gabriel carries him to the “Face” ofthe Lord where the patriarch does obeisance to God. God then person-ally repeats the invitation to Enoch to stand before him forever. Afterthis invitation, archangel Michael brings the patriarch tothe frontof theface of the Lord. The Lord then tells his angels, sounding them out:“Let Enoch join in and stand in front of my face forever!” In responseto this address, the Lord’s glorious ones do obeisance to Enoch saying,“Let Enoch yield in accordance with your word, O Lord!”41After thatthe patriarch’s earthly garments were removed by archangel Michael,he was anointed with shining oil and became like one of the gloriousones.42M.

Two significant features found in2Enochseem to indicate thatthe tradition of angelic veneration is interwoven into the original fab-ric of the text. The first is evidenced in chapter7of the Slavonicapocalypse.2Enoch7:3depicts Enoch carried by angels to the sec-ond heaven. There the patriarch sees the condemned angels kept asprisoners awaiting the “measureless judgment.” Enoch’s angelic guidesexplain to him that the prisoners are “those who turned away fromthe Lord, who did not obey the Lord’s commandments, but of theirown will plotted together and turned away with their prince and withthose who are under restraint in the fifth heaven.”51The story furthercontinues with angelic veneration: the condemned angels bow downto Enoch asking for his intercession: “Man of God, pray for us to theLord!”52It is possible that this passage about the group of the condemnedangels is an allusion to the motif of angelic veneration found in2Enoch22and in the primary Adam books.Three details of the story from2Enoch7seem to support this inter-pretation:a. In2Enoch7, just as in the Adamic accounts, the sin of the impris-oned angels isdisobedienceto the Lord’s commandments.b. The agents of the rebellion are agroup of angelswith “their prince.”This recalls the information found in the Adamic accounts wherenot only Satan, but also other angels under him, refuse to venerate48M. Stone’s argument was later supported and developed by G. Anderson. G. An-derson observes that “one cannot imagine that the tradition in the Enoch materialswas created independently from the tradition found in theVita.” G. Anderson, “TheExaltation of Adam and the Fall of Satan,”Literature on Adam and Eve,101.49Stone, “The Fall of Satan and Adam’s Penance,”48.50Stone, “The Fall of Satan and Adam’s Penance,”48.51Andersen,1.114.52Andersen,1.114."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"on the polemical nature of2(slavonic)enoch253Adam.

An addi-tional important detail here is that the patriarch is addressed bythe fallen angels as a “man”—“a man of God.”This act of angelic bowing before Enoch in the second heaven mightanticipate later angelic obeisance the patriarch received in chapter22of the Slavonic apocalypse.The second evidence demonstrating that the theme of angelic bow-ing from chapter22is deeply imbedded in the original theologicalframework of the Enochic writing is its connection with the Enochictitle “Youth” or “Lad” found in some Slavonic MSS of2Enoch.YouthWe have already seen that the authors of2Enochare responsible forcreating the new roles and titles of Enoch which are absent in theearly Enochic treatises of1Ethiopic Enochbut can be found in the laterMerkabah mysticism. One of such titles is “Youth” which becomesone of the favorite designations of Metatron in the Merkabah litera-ture.Before proceeding to the analysis of the title “Youth” in the Slavonictext and its connection with the Adamic tradition, a short excursus intothe later rabbinic materials is necessary.Recently Gary Anderson demonstrated that the Adamic story ofangelic veneration and opposition to humanity played a prominentrole in rabbinic literature.54In his article Anderson draws attention532Enoch18:3“And those men answered me, ‘These are the Grigori, who turnedaside from the Lord,200myriads, together with their prince Satanail. And similarto them are those who went down as prisoners in their train, who are in the secondheaven, imprisoned in great darkness.’” Andersen,1.130. It is noteworthy that in2Enochthe Enochic story of the Watchers’ rebellion and the Adamic story of Satan’srefusal to venerate humanity appear to be closely connected. They demonstrate anintriguing parallel to theMidrash of Shemhazai and Azael2,3Enoch5:9–10and theZoharIII.207b–208a, where the leaders of the Watchers are depicted as the forces opposingthe creation and elevation of humanity.54G.

Ishmael said: I said to Metatron: “... you are greater than all theprinces, more exalted than all the angels, more beloved than all theministers ... why, then, do they call you ‘Youth’ in the heavenly heights?”He answered: “Because I am Enoch, the son of Jared ... the Holy One,blessed be he, appointed me in the height as a prince and a ruler amongthe ministering angels.

And once they all arose and went to meet meand prostrated themselves before me, saying “Happy are you, and happyyour parents, because your Creator has favored you. Because I am youngin their company and mere youth among them in days and months andyears—therefore they call me ‘Youth’.”56Commenting on this passage, G. Anderson suggests that if “we removethose layers of the tradition that are clearly secondary ... we are leftwith a story that is almost identical to the analog we have traced inthe Adam and Eve literature and II Enoch.”57He further notes thatthe acclamation of Enoch as “Youth” inSefer Hekhalotis intriguingsince the reason3Enochsupplies for this title is deceptively simple andstraightforward: “Because I am young in their company and a mereyouth among them in days and months and years—therefore they callme ‘Youth.’” G.

Anderson’s hypothesis that the origin of the title “Youth” is con-nected with the appropriation of the Adamic tradition is crucial to thecurrent investigation.It is interesting that in some manuscripts of the Slavonic Enochthe seventh antediluvian patriarch is also often addressed as “youth.”59Despite the fact that this designation occurs only in several Slavonicmanuscripts, the author of the recent English translation, Francis An-dersen, considered this reading as the original.60He was also the firstscholar to propose that Enoch’s designation as “Youth” in2Enochrecallsthe identical title of Metatron attested in3Enochand other Hekhalothwritings.61In his commentary to the English translation of2EnochinOTP, Andersen wrote:The remarkable readingyunoˇse[youth], clearly legible in A, supportsthe evidence of V, which has this variant four times (not here), and ofother MSS, that there was a tradition in which Enoch was addressedin this way. The similarity to the vocativeenoˇse[Enoch] might explainthe variant as a purely scribal slip. But it is surprising that it is only inaddress, never in description, that the term is used. The variantjenokhuisrare. There is no phonetic reason why the first vowel should change toju;junokhuis never found. But it cannot be a coincidence that this title isidentical with that of Enoch (= Metatron) in3Enoch.62It is notable that several important occurrences of the title “Youth”in2Enochcome from the mouth of angels. Thus in chapter9of theshorter recension, an angelic being accompanying Enoch on his waythrough the heavenly realm addresses him as “youth:” “This placehas been prepared, Youth, for the righteous ...”63Later in chapter10,one can hear the same address again: “this place, Youth, has been pre-pared for those who practice godless uncleanness on the earth ... .”6458G.

Ishmael asks Meta-tron “What is your name?” Metatron answers, “I have seventy names,corresponding to the seventy nations of the world ... however, my Kingcalls me ‘Youth’.”65The designation of Enoch as “Youth” seems to sig-nify here the special relationship between the Holy One and Metatron.One can see the beginning of this tradition already in2Enochwherein chapter24of the shorter recension the following tradition can befound:AndtheLordcalledme(Enoch)andheplacedmetohimselfcloserthanGabriel.

It does not follow,however, that these readings are secondary and not original. The reha-bilitation of the longer recension, as well as the reaffirmation of itsvalue in recent scholarship, should not lead to the automatic rejectionof everything in the shorter recension as inauthentic and secondary.The mere subscription to one of the recensions deceptively oversimpli-fies the problem of asserting the original text. The task is more compli-cated and necessarily involves a careful investigation of the theologicalintentions of the authors and editors of the text. Almost three decadesago F. Andersen warned students of2Enochagainst jumping to simplis-tic and hasty conclusions. He noted that “all of the materials calls forreassessment ... . In the present state of our knowledge, the genuine-ness of any disputed passage is difficult to judge.”71His prudent advicestill remains valuable today.The Hunger MotifThe previous analysis demonstrated that the author(s) of the Slavonicapocalypse were cognizant of the motifs and themes similar to thosefound in the primary Adam books. One of the prominent Adamicmotifs absent in the Biblical account but present in the later extra-biblical traditions is the theme of Adam and Eve’s hunger after theireviction from Eden to earth.72The primary Adam books begin their stories with depicting theexpulsion of the first humans from the Garden. The narrative continueswith describing the hunger the first humans experienced as they foundthemselves on earth. It seems that the cause of their hunger was not theabsence of food on earth, but the dining habits of the first humans, whowere used to the celestial nourishment during their stay in Paradise. Itis, therefore, significant that the Armenian, Georgian, and Latin ver-sions of the primary Adam books emphasize the difference between the71Andersen,1.93–94.72On the hunger motif in the primary Adam books, see: G.

The second part of2Enochdepicts the patriarch who, just likeAdam and Eve, was transported from heaven to earth. This time,however, the transition is pleasant: Enoch is not punitively expelledfrom heaven, like Adam, but sent by God on a short trip to instruct hischildren. From2Enoch56:2we learn that during Enoch’s instructions,Methuselah asks his father a blessing, so that he may prepare some foodfor him to eat. The patriarch answers his son in the following manner:Listen, child! Since the time when the Lord anointed me with the oint-ment of his glory, food has not come into me, andearthlypleasure mysoul does not remember, nor do I desire anything earthly (2Enoch56:2the longer recension).In the shorter recension of2Enoch, the patriarch’s rejection of food iseven more decisive:Listen my child! Since the time when the Lord anointed me with oint-ment of my glory, it has been horrible for me, and food is not agreeableto me, and I have no desire for earthly food.74The important detail that connects this Enochic account to the accountfound in the Armenian, Georgian, and Latin primary Adam books istheir emphasis on the fact that it is the earthly food that is unsuitablefor those who just came from the celestial realm. The account foundin these versions of the primary Adam books also stresses this fact.They inform that Adam and Eve “did not find food like the food bywhich they had been nourished in the Garden.” Eve’s discourse foundin4:2again emphasizes this difference between earthly and celestialfood, referring to earthly food as nourishment for the beasts.75These similarities suggest that the tradition found in2Enoch56:2might represent a part of the polemics with the Adamic traditions inthe Slavonic apocalypse. Here Enoch is depicted as superior to Adamand Eve, who must accept the earthly food as the sign of the Fall andtheir permanent transition to the lower realm.73“They arose and went about upon the earth, and they did not find food like thefood by which they had been nourished in [the Garden].”A Synopsis of the Books of Adamand Eve.

Thepartiarch’s transition to the new, celestial identity found in this part ofthe text is therefore convenient for appropriating the Adamic traditionabout the luminous condition of the protoplast.The motif of the divine Face is important to linking Enoch’s glori-ous condition with the former luminosity of Adam. Enoch’s luminousmetamorphosis takes its place in front of the Lord’s glorious “extent,”labeled in2Enoch22and39as the Lord’s “Face.”76From2Enoch22we learn that the vision of the divine “Face” had dramatic conse-quences for Enoch’s appearance. His body endured radical changes asit became covered with the divine light. This encounter transformedEnoch into a glorious angelic being. The text says that after this pro-cedure Enoch became like one of the glorious ones, and there was noobservable difference.77This phrase describes Enoch’s transition to hisnew celestial identity as “one of the glorious ones.” During this tran-sition in front of the Lord’s face, Enoch’s own “face” became radi-cally altered and the patriarch acquired a new glorious “visage” which76“I saw the view of the face of the Lord, like iron made burning hot in a fire andbrought out, and it emits sparks and is incandescent. Thus even I saw the face of theLord. But the face of the Lord is not to be talked about, it is so very marvelous andsupremely awesome and supremely frightening. And who am I to give an account ofthe incomprehensible being of the Lord, and of his face, so extremely strange andindescribable? And how many are his commands, and his multiple voice, and theLord’s throne, supremely great and not made by hands, and the choir stalls all aroundhim, the cherubim and the seraphim armies, and their never-silent singing. Who cangive an account of his beautiful appearance, never changing and indescribable, and hisgreat glory? And I fell down flat and did obeisance to the Lord” (2Enoch22:1–4,thelonger recension).

The new creation after the Face signifies here the return tothe prelapsarian condition of Adam, who also was “modeled” afterthe Face of God. Support for this view can be found in2Enoch44:1where one learns that the protoplast was also created after the Faceof God. The text says that “the Lord with his own two hands createdmankind; in a facsimile of his own face, both small and great, the Lordcreated [them].”80It is intriguing that2Enochdeparts here from thecanonical reading attested in Gen1:26–27where Adam was created,not after the face of God, but after His image (tselem). F. Andersenobserves that2Enoch’s“idea is remarkable from any point of view...This is not the original meaning oftselem... The text usespodobie lica[in the likeness of the face], notobrazuorvidenije, the usual terms for“image.”81It is clear, however, that this reading did not arise in the Slavonicenvironment, but belonged to the original argument of2Enochwhere782Enoch’snarrative gives evidence that Enoch’s face acquired the same qualities ofluminosity as the Face of the Lord. In2Enoch37, the Lord calls one of his angels to chillthe face of Enoch before his return to earth. The angel, who “appeared frozen,” thenchilled Enoch’s face with his icy hands. Immediately after this procedure, the Lord tellsEnoch that if his face had not been chilled in such a way, no human being would beable to look at his face. This chilling procedure indicates that Enoch’s metamorphosisnear the Face involves the transformation of the visionary’s face into the fiery, perilousentity which now resembles the Lord’s Face. We can find a detailed description of thisprocess in another “Enochic” text,Sefer Hekhalot, which describes the transformation ofEnoch-Metatron, the Prince of the Divine Presence, into a fiery creature. Cf.3Enoch15:1“R. Ishmael said: The angel Metatron, Prince of the Divine Presence, the glory ofhighest heaven, said to me: When the Holy One, blessed be he, took me to serve thethrone of glory, the wheels of the chariot and all needs of the Shekinah, at once myflesh turned to flame, my sinews to blazing fire, my bones to juniper coals, my eyelashesto lightning flashes, my eyeballs to fiery torches, the hairs of my head to hot flames,all my limbs to wings of burning fire, and the substance of my body to blazing fire.”3Enoch15:1. Alexander,3Enoch,1.267.79It is noteworthy that after this procedure Enoch’s “face,” just as the Lord’s faceacquired the ability to glorify other subjects. Thus in2Enoch64:3–5the followingtradition can be found: “... and the elders of the people and all the community cameand prostrated themselves and kissed Enoch...

There is almost no doubt that, in the view of the informationabout Adam’s glorious angelic nature attested in2Enoch30:11,theauthor of the Slavonic apocalypse tries to connect the theme of Adam’screation with the motif of the glorious Face of the Lord.Regrettably, Böttrich did not recognize the pivotal role of the imag-ery of the divine Face in the original argument of the Slavonic apoc-alypse and rejected the descriptions of the Lord’s Face in2Enoch22and39as later interpolations.82This rejection had, in my judgment,dramatic consequences for Böttrich’s research and his ability to discernthe theology of the text in general and the meaning of the Adamictraditions in2Enochin particular. The tradition of the Divine Face rep-resents a nexus through which several significant polemical trajectoriesof the text are interwoven together. One of these trajectories is the con-nection between the traditions of Adam’s cosmic body in2Enoch30:8–11and theShi#ur Qomahtradition presented in2Enoch39, which depictsEnoch as the measurer of the divine body.83This important connectioncompletely escaped Böttrich’s attention and undermined the credibilityof his later research on the cosmic body of Adam.84Oil from the Tree of LifeAnother Adamic motif in the story of Enoch’s transformation is theluminous oil, which causes the patriarch’s glorious metamorphosis.2Enoch22:9portrays archangel Michael extracting Enoch from hisclothes and anointing him with delightful oil. The text tells that theoil’s appearance was “greater than the greatest light and its ointmentis like sweet dew, and the fragrance [like] myrrh; and it is like rays of82See: C.

And from every direction it has an appearancewhich is gold-looking and crimson, and with the form of fire.”86Theshorter recension also refers to a second, olive tree near the first one“flowing with oil continually.”87It should be noted that the oil anointing of Enoch is a unique motifin the Enochic tradition. Enoch’s approach to the throne in theBook ofthe Watchersand his transformation into the Son of Man in theBook ofthe Similitudesdo not involve anointing with or any usage of oil. Later“Enochic” traditions are also silent about oil. For example, the accountof Metatron’s transformation in3Enochdoes not mention any anointingwith oil.Yet while unknown in the Enochic literature, the motif of anointingwith the oil from the Tree of Life looms large in the Adamic tradition.Chapter35(9) of the primary Adam books contains the story of Adam’ssickness. The patriarch finds himself in great distress and pain. Tryingto find a cure, Adam sends Eve and Seth to paradise so they can bringthe oil of the Tree of Life that will relieve his illness. Their mission,however, is unsuccessful. Archangel Michael refuses to give the oil toEve and Seth, telling them that the oil will be used “when the years ofthe end are filled completely” for those who “be worthy of entering theGarden.”88There are several corresponding characteristics that can be detectedin the Adamic and Enochic accounts:1. The purpose of the anointing is similar in both traditions. Its functionis the “resurrection of Adam’s body”89e.g., the reversal of the earthlyfallen condition into the incorruptible luminous state of the protoplast.85Andersen,1.138.86Andersen,1.114.87Andersen,1.117.88A Synopsis of the Books of Adam and Eve,45E (Armenian version).89A Synopsis of the Books of Adam and Eve,45E (Armenian version)."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"on the polemical nature of2(slavonic)enoch263It is not coincidental that in2Enoch22oil anointing transforms Enochinto a luminous angelic being. As has been already noted, it recalls thedescription of the protoplast in2Enoch30:11as a glorious angelic being.2. The subject of the anointing is also identical. In2Enochand in theprimary Adam books, the oil is used (or will be used) for transformingthe righteous ones in their transition to the angelic state in the celestialrealm. In the primary Adam books, the oil is prepared for those who“be worthy ofentering the Garden.”90M. Stone observes that2Enochalso“knows an anointing with the heavenly perfumed oil that brings abouta transformation of the righteous.”91The same situation is also attested in3Baruch, where the rewardof the righteous is oil. H. Gaylord notes that this theme in3Baruchhas a connection with the Adamic tradition. He observes that “byhis disobedience Adam lost ‘the glory of God’ (4:16[G]), which mayhave been comparable to that of angels (cf.13:4[S]). The reward ofthe righteous is oil, possibly the sign of the glory of God, which theangel-guide promises to show Baruch several times in this text (6:12;7:2;11:2;16:3[S]). It is hardly accidental that there are traditions thatAdam sought to receive the ‘oil of mercy’ at the point of death, andthat Enoch was transformed by the ‘oil of his glory’...”923.Itisimportantthatin2Enochand in the primary Adam books aperson in charge of oil is the archangel Michael.93In2Enoch22heanoints Enoch with shining oil causing his luminous metamorphosis.In3Baruch15:1Michael brings oil to the righteous.94In the primaryAdam books he also seems to be in charge of oil since it is he whodeclines giving Seth the oil for healing Adam.4. It is intriguing that2Enochand the primary Adam accounts refer totheflowingof the oil.

Stone notes that “it isstriking that2Enochhighlights the flowing of the oil, just like the Adambooks.”96These similarities show that the motif of the oil from the Tree ofLife in2Enochmight have Adamic provenance. It is unlikely that thistradition is a later interpolation. Attested in both recensions, it plays apivotal role in the scene of Enoch’s luminous metamorphosis.“The One Who Carried Away the Sin of Humankind”It has been mentioned earlier that in later Jewish mysticism Metatronwas viewed as a divine being first incarnated in Adam and then inEnoch, who re-ascended to the protoplast’s heavenly home and tookhis rightful place in the heights of the universe. P. Alexander observesthat “Enoch thus becomes a redeemer figure—a second Adam throughwhom humanity is restored.”97It appears that this theological motif ofEnoch’s redeeming role is already developed in2Enoch.In chapter64of the longer recension of the Slavonic apocalypse,the “astounding encomium” can be found which, in the view of oneof2Enoch’stranslators, “could hardly please a Christian or a Jew.”98The chapter depicts a prostration of “the elders of the people” and“all the community” before Enoch at the place of his second departureto heaven. The people who came to bow down before the patriarchdelivered to Enoch the following address:O our father,99Enoch! May you be blessed by the Lord, the eternalking! And now, bless your [sons], and all the people, so that we maybe glorified in front of your face today. For you will be glorified in front95A Synopsis of the Books of Adam and Eve,40E.96M.

But what kind of sin was Enochable to carry away?Böttrich argues that the description of Enoch as the one who carriedaway the sins of humankind reflects not the reality but only the expec-tation of the “elders of the people.” He stresses that2Enochabsolutelyrejects the idea of intercession before God,101pointing to the passage inchapter53where the patriarch warns his children that he will not beable to help them on the day of judgment, since no one can help relieveanother person’s sin.102Unfortunately, Böttrich’s observations, based on a faulty methodol-ogy, miss the gist of the argument in chapter64. Oblivious to Adamicpolemics in the text, he fails to notice a crucial detail: in2Enoch64the “elders of the earth” define Enoch not as the one who will carryaway the sin of humankind, but as the one who already carried awaythis sin.103The emphasis on the already accomplished redemptive actprovides an important clue to understanding the kind of sin Enochwas able to erase. The focus here is not on the individual sins ofEnoch’s descendents, but on the primeval sin of humankind.104There-fore, it becomes apparent that the redeeming functions of the patriarchare not related to his possible intercession for the sins of his children,P.B.

Accordingly, Enoch has already accomplished his role as the“redeemer” of humanity through his luminous metamorphosis nearthethroneofglory.105Humanity has been redeemed in him, and thisredemption gives hope to other righteous ones, who will later attain theparadisal condition. The significant detail that confirms Enoch’s uniqueredeeming role is that, unlike in chapter53where he opposes the ideaof intercession, in2Enoch64–65he does not object to the idea that he isable to carry away the sin of humankind.Enoch’s response to the people’s address, which occupies the fol-lowing chapter65, provides additional support for interpreting the sinEnoch was able to carry away as related to the transgression of theprotoplast. It is not coincidental that the patriarch starts his responsewith paraphrasing the account of Adam’s creation, telling that the Lord“constituted man in his own form, in accordance with a similarity.”106He further relates that the Lord gave the protoplast “eyes to see, andears to hear, and heart to think, and reason to argue.”107Some elementsof this part of the paraphrase allude to the details of the protoplast’smarvelous creation found in2Enoch30:9, namely to some of his prop-erties (seeing, hearing, reasoning) given to Adam at his creation.Enoch concludes his reply to the people with the theme of therestoration of humanity to its prelapsarian “paradisal” condition, fur-ther indicating that the whole account revolves around the patriarch’srole in the removal of Adam’s sin. It is logical, therefore, that thismessage of hope comes from the patriarch’s mouth whose humanityhas already been restored to the paradisal condition. In2Enoch65:8–10Enoch tells the people that at the end all the righteous who escapedfrom the Lord’s great judgment “will be collected together into thegreat age ... and they will have a great light, a great indestructiblelight, and paradise, great and incorruptible. For everything corruptiblewill pass away, and the incorruptible will come into being, and will bethe shelter of the eternal residence.”108105The important hint to this unique role is Enoch’s definition in2Enoch64as “theone whom the Lord chose in preference to all the people of the earth.”106Andersen,1.190.107Andersen,1.190.108Andersen,1.192."},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"on the polemical nature of2(slavonic)enoch267ConclusionThe limited scope of this paper did not allow the exploration of all thefacets of the Adamic polemics in2Enoch.109However, some conclusionscan be drawn at this stage of the research.1. The foregoing survey testifies to the existence of Adamic polemics in2Enoch. These polemical developments contain, not only the “internal”debates based on2Enoch’sdepictions of the protoplast, but also theintertextual polemics with the “external” Adamic traditions attested inthe primary Adam books.2. The analysis shows that Adamic polemics involves a rewriting of“original” Adamic motifs and themes when the details of Adam’s “sto-ry” are transferred to a new “hero,” the seventh antediluvian patriarchEnoch.3. The analysis demonstrates that, similar to the early booklets of1Enochthe attitude of the author(s) of2Enochto Adam’s figure and thetraditions associated with his name, reminds highly polemical. Yet, incomparison with1Enoch, the Slavonic Enoch demonstrates a paradigmshift in polemical strategy. Now the competitive tradition is not silencedbut is rather exposed and openly appropriated for polemics. This switchmight be connected with the challenge which the intense developmentof the traditions about the exalted patriarchs and prophets posed to the“classical” profile of Enoch found in early Enochic booklets. Adamic,Mosaic, and Noachic polemics found in2Enochmight represent thereaction of the Enochic tradition to these new conceptual develop-ments. It should be noted that the traditions about the elevated Adamappear to have been widespread in the Alexandrian environment ofthe first century CE, the possible place and time of the composition of2Enoch.4. The investigation of Adamic polemics proves that a number ofimportant passages associated with the early Jewish mysticism, such109One of these unexplored subjects includes the connection between the tradition ofAdam’s cosmic body in2Enoch30and the role of Enoch as the measurer of the divinebody in2Enoch39."},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"268the adam traditionas the motif of the Divine Face in chapters22and39,thefutureprominent role of Enoch-Metatron as the governing power on theearth, and his title “Youth,” belong to the primary text, since they playa decisive role in the original argument of the Slavonic apocalypse. Inthe light of this role Böttrich’s hypothesis that these themes representlater interpolations must now be dismissed as erroneous.5. The analysis of the polemical developments in the text also revealsthat the theological intentions of its authors were not to find a peace-ful consensus with the non-Jewish environment in the Diaspora situa-tion, as Böttrich proposed, but to resolve the internal problems of theEnochic tradition in its encounter with the challenges of its competitors."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"“MANY LAMPS ARE LIGHTENED FROM THEONE”: PARADIGMS OF THE TRANSFORMATIONALVISION IN THE MACARIAN HOMILIESAmong mystical testimonies circulating in the Eastern Christian tra-dition, two portentous descriptions of transformational visions can befound.The first account is drawn from2Enoch, a Jewish apocalypse, appar-ently written in the first century CE and preserved in the EasternChristian environment in its Slavonic translation. In this text the ante-diluvian patriarch Enoch describes his luminous metamorphosis neartheThroneofGlory:And Michael, the Lord’s greatest archangel, lifted me up and broughtme in front of the face of the Lord ... And Michael extracted me frommy clothes. He anointed me with the delightful oil; and the appearanceof that oil is greater than the greatest light, its ointment is like sweet dew,and its fragrance like myrrh; and its shining is like the sun. And I gazedat all of myself, and I had become like one of the glorious ones, and therewas no observable difference.1The second account is written a thousand years later and comes fromthePhilokalia, a collection of Eastern Christian writings compiled byNicodemus Hagioretes, in which Pseudo-Symeon conveys preparatoryinstructions for acquiring the vision of the Taboric light:Then sit down in a quite cell, in a corner by yourself, and do what Itell you. Close the door, and withdraw your intellect from everythingworthless and transient. Rest your beard on your chest, and focus yourphysical gaze, together with the whole of your intellect, upon the centreof your belly or your navel.

For as soon as the intellect attains the place of the heart, at onceit sees things of which it previously knew nothing. It sees the openspace within the heart and it beholds itself entirely luminous and fullof discrimination.2It is apparent that these two descriptions belong to very different sym-bolic worlds. In the first one, an adept, on his celestial trip, finds him-self before the glorious appearance of the Lord, accompanied by theangels who extract the visitor from his earthly garments and anointhim with delightful oil. In the second one, he is led through darknessand “an impenetrable density” on the inner journey to the depth ofhis heart. The majesty of the celestial environment strikingly confrontsthe monotonous quietness of the inner contemplation. Still, somethingsimilar is recognizable in these two accounts. In both descriptions thevisionaries eventually come to the same result—they behold themselvesluminescent. Both accounts also stress the totality of this metamorpho-sis—mystical adepts of these visions become “entirely” luminous. It is,however, observable that in the two accounts the source of the divinelight is different. In the first account, it comes from outside, namelyfrom the glorious appearance of the Lord, depicted symbolically asthe angelic anointing with shining oil. The shining oil, the “cover-ing” substance of the transformation, serves as an additional detailwhich stresses the outer nature of the visionary’s luminous metamor-phosis.The important feature of the second account which differentiates itfrom the first is the “inner” nature of the luminous metamorphosis—the illumination comes from inside, from the darkness of the soul,proceeding from the open space within the heart of the visionary.Separated by a millennium, these two accounts serve as significantmarkers of the long-lasting theological journey from the outer transfor-mational vision to its inner counterpart. On this journey the toweringfigure of the Syrian father, known to us as Pseudo-Macarius, remainsprominent.

The term\u000b\f\u0016\u0015can be translated as “substance,”“body,” “mass,” “power,” “might,” “honor,” “glory,” “splendor.” In its meaning as“glory”Kavodusually refers to God, his sanctuary, his city, or sacred paraphernalia. ThePriestly tradition uses the term in connection with God’s appearences in the tabernacle.P and Ezekiel describeKavodas a blazing fire surrounded by radiance and a greatcloud. M. Weinfeld, “\u000b\f\u0016\u0015,”TDOT,7.22–38.12It is also noteworthy that Ezekiel and the materials of the Priestly tradition, suchas Gen5:1, share similar terminology, namely the term\u0013\f\u0012\u000b.Theterm\u0013\f\u0012\u000bappears12times in the Book of Ezekiel where it becomes a favorite terminology for the descriptionof various divine and angelic “appearances.” It occupies a prominent place in Biblicalanthropomorphic debates.

In the Hebrew Bible, as well as in later apocalyptic tradi-tions, God’s “form” remains hidden behind His light. The hiddenKavodis revealed through its light.19This situation explains the wide use of theKavodparadigm in the visions of light phenomena.Kavodtheology leads to the special type of transformational visionsthat can be found in various biblical and apocalyptic materials.20In theclimactic points of these accounts, their visionaries normally “see” theextent of the divine glory, often portrayed as enthroned anthropomor-phic figure. As a consequence of this encounter, the visionary experi-ences a dramatic external metamorphosis which often affects his face,limbs, and garments, making them luminescent. A classic example ofsuch a transformational vision is the account of Moses’ shining coun-tenance in Ex34after his encounter with the Lord’sKavodon MountSinai. It is noteworthy that in the apocalyptic and Merkabah traditionsthe vision of the Lord’s Glory (“the King in His beauty”) increasinglybecome the main teleological point of the heavenly ascents.Enoch’s transformation in the Slavonic apocalypse also belongs totheKavodparadigm. Enoch’s luminous metamorphosis took place inthe front of the Lord’s glorious “extent,” labeled in2Enochas the Lord’s“Face.”21From this Enochic account we learn that the vision of the17Weinfeld,Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomic School,201.18Weinfeld,Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomic School,202.19De Conick,Seek to See Him,104–105. De Conick’s research investigates the rela-tionships between God’s form and God’s light, showing their complexity. She arguesthat in some traditions God’s form remains hidden behind His light.

A significant detail in this description is that Enoch is nottransformed into light but covered, “clothed,” with the light of God’sGlory. The use of delightful oil as a covering substance emphasizes this“covering nature” of the luminous metamorphosis.In Enoch’s radiant metamorphosis before the Divine Face an impor-tant detail can be found which links Enoch’s transformation with thatof Moses’ account in Exodus. In2Enoch37we learn about the unusualprocedure performed on Enoch’s face in the final stage of his encounterwith the Lord. The text informs that the Lord called one of his seniorangels to chill the face of Enoch. The text says that the angel appearedfrigid; he was as white as snow, and his hands were as cold as ice.The text further depicts the angel chilling Enoch’s face, who could notendure the terror of the Lord, “just as it is not possible to endure thefireofastoveandtheheatofthesun...”22Right after this “chilling pro-cedure,” the Lord informs Enoch that if his face had not been chilledhere, no human being would have been able to look at his face.23Thisreference to the radiance of Enoch’s face after his encounter with theLord is an apparent parallel to the incandescent face of Moses after theSinai experience in Ex34.In spite of the dominant role of theKavodpattern in biblical andapocalyptic theophanic accounts, it becomes increasingly challenged inthe postbiblical rabbinic24and patristic environments which offered newgive an account of his beautiful appearance, never changing and indescribable, and hisgreat glory?

Second, he lost the very image itself (α\u0019τ4ν τ4ν ε/κ%να)in which was laid up for him, according to God’s promise, the fullheavenly inheritance” (II.12.1).28Further, another important passage inthe homily informs the reader that Adam and Eve before the Fall wereclothed (\u001eνδεδυμ\u0015ν\u0011ι) with God’s glory in place of clothing (II.12.8).29The text reveals a certain continuity between Adam’s “very imageitself ” and his glorious clothing. An important detail in the narrativeis that the homilist makes a distinction between Adam’s nature, createdaccording to the image and likeness of God30and Adam’s “very image(ε/κ%να) itself,” speaking about them as of two separate entities whichwere lost during the Fall. This subtle theological distinction shows theauthor’s familiarity with the Jewish aggadic traditions abouttselem(Heb.\u0002\u000f\u001d) of Adam—the luminous image of God’s glory according to whichAdam was created.31The term “image” (Gk.ε/κ5ν) can be found in a number of sig-nificant New Testament passages.

In Pauline writings we can also see peculiar terminologicalparallels in which the notion of image (ε/κ5ν) becomes closely asso-ciated with important theophanic concepts, prominent in traditionalKavodtheology, such as glory33(δ% α)34and form (μ\u0011ρ#\u001f).35Other important theological developments in Gnostic36and rabbiniccircles lead to a gradual “interiorization” of thetselemimagery. Inpostbiblical Jewish accounts,tselemis often identified with the luminous“clothing” of the human heart. Scholem’s research shows that in Jewishmysticismtselemwas also understood as a sort of “garment” of the soul,32J.

It is especially noticeable in Gregory Pala-mas’ theology of the divine image which shows amazing parallels to theconcepts and imagery of Macarius.

I would proposethat these various levels, or various bodies, reflect one another. The physical body is areflection of the body of light.

Meir’s Torah it was foundwritten, ‘Garments of light’: this refers to Adam’s garments, which were like a torch[shedding radiance], broad at the bottom and narrow at the top.” H. Freedman andM.

According to the tradi-tion, it happened because after their transgression they lost their original radiance—the“garments of light” which prevented them from seeing their naked “physical” bodies.Luminosity thus served for the prelapsarian humankind as a sort of screen which con-cealed their original form. Gregory Palamas clearly employs this tradition.44“Even though we still bear God’s image to a greater degree than the angels, yet asregards the likeness of God we fall far short of them.”Philokalia,4.376.45Philokalia,4.376.46Cf.

In postbiblical Jewish and Christianwritings the MosesGestalt, however, gradually became utilized for thepurposes of internalized visions. It cannot be a coincidence that in thesenew theological “developments,” the Moses account was also linkedwith thetselemimagery.These tendencies are noticeable in the Macarian Homilies whereMoses is often portrayed as Adam’s luminous counterpart. Followingthe already mentioned Adamic narrative of Homily II.12, which tellsus how Adam lost his luminous status and “obeyed his darker side,”Macarius gives us Moses’ example who “had a glory shining on hiscountenance.” The homily refers to Moses’ Sinai experience, expand-ing this tradition and adding some new significant details:Indeed, the Word of God was his food and he had a glory shiningon his countenance. All this, which happened to him, was a figure ofsomething else. For that glory now shines splendidly from within thehearts of Christians. At the resurrection their bodies, as they rise, willbe covered (σκεπ6+εται) with another vesture, one that is divine, and theywill be nourished with a heavenly food (II.12.14).49It is noticeable that the passage serves as a bridge between the symbolicworlds of theKavodandtselem. Macarius openly “internalizes” theMoses account, stressing that Moses’ glory now “shines splendidly fromwithin the hearts of Christians.” On the other hand, some featuresof theKavod’s paradigm are still noticeable: the homilist understandsMoses’ luminosity as a covering with God’s glory.50The author’s furtherdiscussion in II.12.15about the clothing of Christians and wrappingthem in “divine and glorious garments” gives additional strength to thismotif of Moses, covered with the luminous garments of God’s glory.The tendencies for internalizing theKavodparadigm through impli-cations of the concept of God’s image found in Macarian Homiliesdemonstrate amazing similarities to some Jewish developments. Thelate Rabbinic midrashim attest to such traditions.51The origin of such49Pseudo-Macarius,The Fifty Spiritual Homilies and the Great Letter,102.H.Dörriesetal.Die50Geistlichen Homilien des Makarios,114.50The motif of covering with the Glory is also prominent in another Macarianpassage which depicts Moses’ shining countenance: “For blessed Moses provided uswith a certain type through the glory of the Spirit which covered his countenance uponwhich no one could look with steadfast gaze (II.15.10).” Pseudo-Macarius,The FiftySpiritual Homilies and the Great Letter,74.51In Rabbinic literature the traditions about Moses as a luminous conterpart ofAdam also can be found.

F. Andersen stresses the theo-logical uniqueness of such creational imagery. He, however, does notclarify what the creation after the Lord’s Face means in the broadertextual context of the Slavonic apocalypse. The Lord’s Face plays animportant role in2Enoch’stheophanic descriptions being identified withthe Lord’s glorious form—HisKavod. In chapter22of2Enochthe Lord’sFace emits light and fire and serves as the source of Enoch’s luminousmetamorphosis. In this context, the creation of Adam after the Lord’sFace demonstrates a remarkable effort toward merging theKavodandtselemparadigms of the transformational vision.The previous investigation shows the important role of the Adam–Moses connection in the evolution from outer to inner in theKavodimagery. It is clear, however, that in the Macarian writings the internal-izing of theKavodparadigm is not confined solely to the reevaluation ofMoses’Gestalt.Theeffort is much more radical. In fact, it is so revolu-tionary that it strikes even distinguished students of the mystical tradi-tions. One of them, Gershom Scholem, points to the amazing Macar-ian tendency for mystical “reinterpretation” of the Merkabah vision ofEzekiel in which the human soul become itself the throne of glory.52InHomily II.1.1–2Macarius writes:When Ezekiel the prophet beheld the divinely glorious vision, he de-scribed it in human terms but in a way full of mysteries that completelysurpass the powers of the human mind... . And all of this which theis the basis for comparison between Moses and Adam in several rabbinical materials.”Alon Goshen Gottstein, “The Body as Image of God in Rabbinic Literature,”182.Deut.R.11.3attests to such traditions: “Adam said to Moses: ‘I am greater than you becauseI have been created in the image of God.’ Whence this? For it is said, ‘and God createdman in his own image’ (Gen.1,27). Moses replied to him: ‘I am far superior to you, forthe honor which was given to you has been taken away from you, as it is said: but man(Adam) abideth not in honor, (Ps. XLIX,13) but as for me, the radiant countenancewhich God gave me still remains with me.’ Whence? For it is said: ‘his eye was not dim,nor his natural force abated’ (Deut.34:7).” H. Freedman and M. Simon (tr.),MidrashRabbah(10vols.; London: Soncino Press,1939),7.173. Gottstein also gives anothermidrashic passage fromMidrash Tadshe4in which Moses is again Adam’s luminouscounterpart: “In the likeness of the creation of the world the Holy One blessed be heperformed miracles for Israel when they came out of Egypt... In the beginning: ‘andGod created man in his image,’ and in the desert: ‘and Moshe knew not that the skinof his face shone.’” Cf.

For the prophet was viewingthe mystery of the human soul that would receive its Lord and wouldbecome his throne of glory. For the soul that is deemed to be judgedworthy to participate in the light of the Holy Spirit by becoming histhrone and habitation, and is covered with the beauty of ineffable gloryof the Spirit, becomes all light, all face, all eye.53Scholem, observing such a radical rethinking of classicKavodimagery,further asks the legitimate question: “was there not a temptation toregard man himself as the representative of divinity, his soul as thethrone of glory?”54Interestingly enough, this query directs us to thevery heart of the Macarian theological enterprise in which theKavodinternalization become possible only as a consequence of the uniqueinterrelationships between human and divine in the event of Christ’stransfiguration.Crystallization of the New Paradigm:The Macarian Account of the Lord’s TransfigurationThe previous analysis shows that in the Macarian homilies Moses’shining countenance and the luminosity of Adam’s prelapsariantselemserve as metaphors for major paradigms of the transformational vision.In the Macarian writings, one can also encounter a third paradigmof luminous transformation which is radically different from the pre-vious two traditions. In a peculiar Macarian understanding of Christ’stransfiguration55on Mt. Tabor, the duality of inner and outer in thevisio53Pseudo-Macarius,The Fifty Spiritual Homilies and the Great Letter,37.54G. Scholem,Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism(New York: Schocken,1961),79.55The original Synoptic accounts of Christ’s transfiguration seem influenced by theKavodparadigm in its classical Exodus’ form. Several details of the account serve asimportant reminders: the vision took place on a mountain, the presence of Moses,a bright cloud that enveloped the visionaries, a voice which came out of the cloud,and the shining face of Christ.

Cf.J. Behm,TDNT,4.755–757.57Another important testimony to the Lord’s Body of Light isPseudo-ClementineHomily17:7which pictures the brilliant radiance of Christ’s body in connection withChrist’s image: “For He has shape, and He has every limb primarily and solely forbeauty’s sake, and not for use. For He has not eyes that He may see with them; for Hesees on every side, since He is incomparably more brilliant in His body than the visualspirit which is in us, and He is more splendid than everything, so that in comparisonwith Him the light of the sun may be reckoned as darkness. Nor has He ears thatHe may hear; for He hears, perceives, moves, energizes, acts on every side. But Hehas the most beautiful shape on account of man, that the pure in heart may be ableto see Him, that they may rejoice because they suffered. For He molded man in Hisown shape as in the grandest seal, in order that he may be the ruler and lord of all,and that all may be subject to him. Wherefore, judging that He is the universe, andthat man is His image (for He is Himself invisible, but His image man is visible), theman who wishes to worship Him honours His visible image, which is man.” A. Robertsand J. Donaldson, eds.,The Ante-Nicene Fathers(10vols.; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans,1950–1951),8.319–320. It is important that here Christ’s luminosity is placed into the accountof Adam’s creation after God’s image. The phrase “He is incomparably more brilliantin his body than the visual spirit which is in us” deserves particular attention since itcan refer to the correspondence between the Lord’s luminous “body” and the Adamictselem.58Pseudo-Macarius,The Fifty Spiritual Homilies and the Great Letter,122–123.H.Dörrieset al.Die50Geistlichen Homilien des Makarios,149–150.59Origen inPrinc.2.3.7remarks that the best and purest spirits must have some kindof body, being changed according to their degree of merit into an ethereal condition,and interprets “change” in1Cor15:52as “shining with light.”60Pseudo-Macarius,The Fifty Spiritual Homilies and the Great Letter,122–123.H.Dörrieset al.Die50Geistlichen Homilien des Makarios,149–150."},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"“many lamps are lightened from the one”285The language of the passage further reinforces the totality of thistransformational vision—Christ’s internal glory serves as the teleologi-cal source of his complete, luminous metamorphosis.In the articulation of the newness of Christ’s condition, Macariusthus offers a completely new paradigm of the beatific vision—the bod-ies of visionaries are now not simply covered externally with the divinelight but are “lightened”61in the way as many lamps are lightened fromthe one:Similarly, as many lamps are lighted from the one, same fire, so also itis necessary that the bodies of the saints, which are members of Christ,become the same which Christ himself is. (II.15.38).62In this new concept of the transformational vision, Macarius, how-ever, sets a significant distinction between Christ’s Transfiguration andhuman luminous transformation. In contrast to the Lord’s metamor-phosis, the bodies of mortals cannot be completely “transfigured intothe divine glory” but rather simply become “glorified.”The hypostatic quality of Christ’s luminous form is what differen-tiates Him from transformed Christians who are only predestined toparticipate in the light of His Glory and “have put on the raiment ofineffable light.”63This articulation of the distinction between Christ’shypostasis and His light will play later an important role in Palamas’dialectics of God’s essence and the divine energies.ConclusionIt is time to return to the passage from thePhilokaliawhich began thisinvestigation. In comparison with the “traditional” cases of transforma-tional visions, this account might appear as quite ambiguous. It demon-strates the absence of significant details of such visions in which theluminous metamorphosis of a visionary becomes possible as the conse-quence of the beatific vision of the glorious “form” of the Deity. Theteleological necessity of such a divine form, in its external or internal61It is noteworthy that the homilist applies the imagery of “covering” not only to thephysical bodies of these Christians but also to their souls which according to him will be“covered with the beauty of the ineffable glory of the light of Christ.” Pseudo-Macarius,The Fifty Spiritual Homilies and the Great Letter,37.62Pseudo-Macarius,The Fifty Spiritual Homilies and the Great Letter,122–123.H.Dörrieset al.Die50Geistlichen Homilien des Makarios,149–150.63Pseudo-Macarius,The Fifty Spiritual Homilies and the Great Letter,44."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"286the adam traditionmanifestations, seems to presuppose the very possibility of any luminousmetamorphosis. On the contrary, in thePhilokaliaaccount a visionarydoes not see any luminous form, but “the open space within the heart,”which, however, makes him entirely luminous.The answer to this strange situation can be found in the Macarianunderstanding of Christ’s transfiguration on Mount Tabor which playsa paradigmatic role in later Hesychastic visions of the divine light.Macarius’ position implies that Christ in the Tabor story representsboth aspects of the transformational vision. First, He is the Glory afterwhich a visionary is transformed. Second, He is also the visionaryhimself, whose face and garments are transformed.64In the Macarianwritings Christ’s interior glory is poured out upon his external body,making it luminous.For as the body of the Lord was glorified when he climbed the mountand was transfigured into the divine glory and into infinite light, so alsothe bodies of the saints are glorified and shine like lightning. Just as theinterior glory of Christ covered his body and shone completely, in thesame way also in the saints the interior power of Christ in them in theday will be poured out exteriorly upon their bodies... (II.15.38).65In the light of the Macarian account of Christ’s transfiguration, therequirement for the divine glorious form as the transforming sourceof the visionary experience becomes replaced by the notion of thedivine energies. It becomes possible since the locus of the visionary’sperspective now is not external to the divine luminous form, but israther immanent within it. In this situation the dichotomy between thesubject of the beautific vision and the object of the beautific vision canbe easily overcome.A Hesychast in his transformational vision intends to resemble Christin the Transfiguration. He focuses his physical and intellectual gaze noton the outside but on the inside, upon his heart, “where all the powersof the soul reside,” waiting patiently that the interior power of Christwill lighten him as a lamp, so he can “become the same which Christhimself is.” Divine glory here, just as in theKavodtradition, is still64The luminous face and the transformed garments of Christ in the Synopticaccounts of the Transfiguration may stress the role of Christ as a visionary of Hisown glory.

Reeves had earlier suggested that the “gar-deners” might represent the Watchers prior to their apostasy. He notesthat the image of the gardeners “watering” the garden may allude tothe initial educational mission of the Watchers, who, according toJub.4:15, were originally sent by God on earth to instruct humans in moralconduct.29The second detail of the description concerns the imagery of thetrees. It seems that the trees symbolize not the vegetation, but theinhabitants of the garden: angelic, human, or composite creatures.Arboreal metaphors are often used in Enochic tradition to describe theWatchers and the Giants (cf.CD2.17–19).Another important detail is found in theMidrash of Shemhazai andAzael, in which the destruction of the garden is associated with theflood and Noah’s escape from it.4Q530line10also seems to alludeto the flood, since Hahyah’s dream mentions the destruction of thegarden by fire andwater. A short Qumran fragment,6Q8, also providesevidence for the connection of Hahyah’s dream with Noah’s escape.F. García Martínez observes that the reference to Noah and his sonsin theMidrash of Shemhazai and Azaelhas its equivalent in6Q8line2,30which speaks of three shoots preserved from the flood so as to signifythe escape of Noah and his three sons.31J. Reeves offers the following reconstruction of the dream based onthe two fragments:32Hahyah beholds in his vision a grove of trees carefully attended by gar-deners. This tranquil scene is interrupted by the sudden appearance (ortransformation?) of two hundred figures within this garden.

While Hahyah viewed this scene, emissaries fromHeaven arrived and ravaged the garden with water and fire, leaving onlyone tree bearing three branches as the sole survivor of the destruction.33A comparison of this description from theBook of Giantswith the storyfound in the Slavonic version of3Baruch4shows that both accountsseem to have three similar events that follow one another in the samesequence: the planting of the garden, the destruction of the garden, andthe escape of one tree from the destruction. These intriguing similaritiescall for a more thorough investigation of the parallels between thegarden traditions found in the3Baruch4and theBook of Giants.III.The Angelic Planting of the Garden (3Apoc. Bar.4:7–8)The motif of angels planting the garden is uniquely preserved in theSlavonic version of3Baruch.34In the text, the tale about the plantingcomes from the mouth of Baruch’s angelic guide. From him the vision-ary learns that God commanded Michael to gather two hundred thou-sand and three angels in order to plant the garden. The story furthertells that Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, Raphael and Sataniel planted fivetrees. Other angels also planted “various trees.”Several features in the story of the planting found in3Apoc. Bar.4:7–8seem to resonate with the account found in theBook of Giants.Thesedetails include the following significant points:1.3Apoc. Bar.4:7mentions two hundred thousand and three angelsplanting the garden;2. the fallen angel Sataniel also takes part in planting the “trees”;3. according to the story, Sataniel plants the bad tree—the tree ofdeception;4. the tree is described as a sinful desire that the fallen angel had forhumans;5.3Apoc. Bar.4:7mentions the planting of five types of trees in thegarden.33Reeves,Jewish Lore,95.34The Greek version contains only a very short reference to Samael’s planting of thetree: “It is the vine which the angel Samael planted (\u001e#!τευσεν) by which the Lord Godbecame angered, and he cursed him and his planting (τ4ν #υτε\u000eαν α\u0019τ\u00112).” Gaylord, “3Baruch,”667;seealsoPicard,Apocalypsis Baruchi Graece,85."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"298the adam tradition1. The first feature of3Baruch4that recalls theBook of Giantsis thenumber of angelic hosts involved in planting the garden.3Apoc. Bar.4:7tells that God commanded Michael35to gather two hundred thousandand three angels in order to plant the garden. The numeral two hun-dred thousand and three, reserved here for the number of angelic hosts,gives a clue to the reader that the angelic “gardeners” described in3Apoc. Bar.4:7are somehow related to the fallen Watchers, who in theBook of Giants“planted” gigantic “trees” on the earth through their iniq-uities.36In early Enochic accounts, the numeral “two hundred” oftenrefers to the number of the Watchers descending on Mount Hermon.37Some later Enochic accounts, however, tend to exaggerate the num-ber of the fallen Watchers, depicting them as two hundred thousandor two hundred myriads. For example, in the longer recension2Enoch18:3, the angelic guides give Enoch the following information about theWatchers: “These are theGregori(Watchers), who turned aside from theLord,200myriads, together with their prince Satanail.”38It is notewor-thy that in3Baruch4, similar to2Enoch18, the tradition about the twohundred myriads of angelic beings is creatively conflated with the nameof Sataniel.3935The commissioning of Michael for the mission of gathering two hundred thou-sand angels might allude to Michael’s role in theBook of the Watchers(1Enoch10:11–15),where he is responsible for the affairs connected with Shemihazah and the Watchers.36That three angels are mentioned in3Apoc. Bar.4:7in conjunction with thetwo hundred thousand angels might be a reference to a tradition in which the threeprincipal angels (Raphael, Uriel, Gabriel) were called by the fourth principal angel,Michael, to fulfill God’s command to plant the garden. Another explanation of theangelic triad in3Apoc. Bar.4:7is that is could represent the leaders of the Watchersgroup. The later Enochic accounts often speak aboutthree, not two, leaders of the fallenWatch e r s. S e e3Enoch4:5–6“... And the Holy One, blessed be he, appointed me[Enoch] in the height as a prince and a ruler among the ministering angels. Then threeof ministering angels, Uzzah, Azzah, and Azael, came and laid charges against me inthe heavenly height” (P. Alexander, “3(Hebrew Apocalypse of) Enoch,”OTP,1.258).See also3Enoch5:9“... it was only because Uzzah, Azzah, and Azael taught themsorceries that they brought them down and employed them, for otherwise they wouldnot have been able to bring them down” (OTP,1.260).

Bar.4:7–8, one of the angelic creatures planting thegarden along with the four principal angels (Michael, Gabriel, Uriel,and Raphael) is the fallen angel Sataniel. The description of Sataniel asthe gardener is puzzling. The pseudepigraphic texts usually follow thebiblical account40that claims that the garden was planted by God (Gen2:8).41This motif of the fallen “planter” might, therefore, parallel theBook of Giants, where the fallen angels are also depicted as gardeners.3.In3Baruchand in theBook of Giants, the “planting of trees/tree”is part of the angelic plot to corrupt the human race. In theBook ofGiants, the “gardeners,” represented by fallen angelic beings, “plant”bad “trees”—the wicked offspring that, through their enormous appe-tites, brought many disasters to the antedeluvian generation. In3Baruch4, the “gardener,” the fallen angel Sataniel, also plants a tree designedto cause the fall and degradation of the human race. In3Baruch,thevine tree eventually becomes the tool through which Adam and Evewere deceived and corrupted.4. The account in3Baruchconnects the tree planted by Sataniel withthe “sinful desire” spread by this fallen angel over the first humans. In4:8,theangelus interprestells Baruch that “in the first place, the tree wasthe vine, but secondly, the tree (is) sinful desire42which Sataniel spreadover Adam and Eve.”43This reference to the “sinful desire” of the fallenangel over humans is intriguing since it alludes to the terminologyfound in Enochic tradition. Thus1Enoch6says that the Watchers hadsinful desire for human creatures.44TheMidrash of Shemhazai and Azaelalso uses the term “evil desire” or “evil inclination” (Heb.\u0007\u0006\u0007\u001d\u0003)inWatchers is supported also by the information found in other parts of the book. Accord-ing to Bauckham (“Early Jewish Visions of Hell,”372), the author of3Barindeed knewabout the story of the Watchers. He suggests that two groups of condemned angelsin chaps.2and3of3Baruchparallel two groups of Watchers in the second and fifthheaven from2Enoch7and18.40I am indebted to Professor Michael Stone for this clarification.41See also4Q504 8:4–6“...

Althoughthe number of the principal angels seems unusual, the reference tothe “five trees” excites interest in light of a passage found among thefragments of the ManicheanBook of Giantspublished by W.B.

By contrast, the Adamicstory traces the source of evil to the fall of Adam and Eve in Eden.These two accounts share many common details that reveal a persistentand strenuous polemic between the two traditions.

Bar.4:8, the angel tells the visionary about the evil role thevine tree played in Sataniel’s deception of Adam and Eve. Accordingto the story, God, as a result of this deception, cursed the vine andits seed. Upon hearing this story, Baruch asked the angel why, despiteGod’s curse, the vine can still exist. The angel told Baruch about theflood in the heavenly garden.The story recounts that God first caused the flood upon the earth,which led to the drowning of “every firstling,” including104,000giants.Then the water rose above the highest mountains and flooded the heav-enly garden. As God withdrew the water, “all flower” was destroyedexcept for one shoot from the vine. When the land appeared from thewater, Noah went out from his ark and discovered the vine lying on theground.Several points of this flood story resemble the account found in theBook of Giants, including the following details:1.In3Apoc. Bar.4:10and in theBook of Giants,thefloodingofthegarden is parallel to the flood on the earth.2. In both traditions the destruction of all vegetation (in3Baruch“allflower”)52in the garden “mirrors” the destruction of all flesh andthe giants on earth.3. In both traditions the surviving “plant” from the flooded garden isparallel to the escape of Noah from the flood.1. Later rabbinic materials sometimes operate with the notion of twogardens: the celestial garden of Eden and the terrestrial garden. In3Enoch5:5–6we learn that before the generation of Enosh had sinned,God’sShekinahfreely traveled from one garden to the other:When the Holy One, blessed be he, went out and in from the gardento Eden, and from Eden to the garden, from the garden to heaven,and from heaven to the garden of Eden, all gazed at the bright imageofShekinahand were unharmed—until the coming of the generation ofEnosh, who was the chief of all the idolaters in the world.53The story of the garden in3Baruch4might represent an early traditionabout the two gardens, since in this apocalypse the garden becomesthe locus of celestial and terrestrial events at the same time.

Bar.4:10–11, the events taking place inheaven and on earth are depicted as if they were to mirror each other:the destruction of “all flesh,” including the giants on earth, “mirrors”the destruction of “all flower” in the heavenly garden. Both accountsalso mention survivors, the patriarch Noah from the flooded earth andone plant from the flooded heavenly garden. This parallelism resemblesthe one in theBook of Giants, where the dream(s) about the destroyed“vegetation” of the garden and the single preserved shoot symbolizedthe drowned giants and Noah’s miraculous escape.2. As we mentioned above, in the Enochic traditions the fallen angelsand their offspring are often depicted through arboreal imagery.CD2.17–19refers to the giants as tall cedars.54TheBook of Giantssupports this tendency: in the Manichean fragments of this composi-tion, the Watchers are unambiguously associated with the trees.55TheMidrash of Shemhazai and Azaelalso seems to take the vegetation of thegarden as a symbol of the Watchers/Giants group. This correspon-dence is made not directly but through parallelism. In theMidrash,Shemhazai’s statement about the flood on earth follows immediatelyafter Hiyya’s dream about the destruction of the trees. The two eventsseem to “mirror” each other in such a way that the first depicts thesecond symbolically.3Apoc. Bar.4:10follows the same pattern, portraying the destructionof “all flesh” and the giants on earth and the destruction of “all flower”in the heavenly garden as two “mirroring” processes taking place in thecelestial and terrestrial realms. The similarities between the descriptionsin3Baruch4and theBook of Giantsseem not to be coincidental. Inaddition, the description of “all flesh” in3Apoc. Bar.4:10includes adirect reference to the drowned giants.5654“For having walked in the stubbornness of their hearts the Watchers of the heavenfell; on account of it they were caught, for they did not heed the precepts of God. Andtheir sons, whose height was like that of cedars and whose bodies were like mountains,fell.” (García Martínez and Tigchelaar,Dead Sea Scrolls Study Edition,1.555).55“... outside ... and ... left ... read the dream we have seen. Thereupon Enochthus ... and the trees that come out, those are the Egregoroi, and the giants that cameout of the women. And ... over ... pulled out ... over ....” (Henning, “Book of theGiants,”66).56It is possible that3Apoc. Bar.4:3also attests to the traditions of the giants.

The next is the identification of Noah with the “escaped plant.”In theMidrash of Shemhazai and Azael, the giant Hiyya beholds in hisdream one tree with three branches that survived the destruction ofthe garden. The text tells that “an angel (was seen by him) descend-ing from the firmament with an axe in his hand, and he was cut-ting down all trees, so that there remained only one tree containingthree branches.”57A verse later, the story switches to Noah and histhree sons:58“He [Shemhazai] said to them [Hiwwa and Hiyya]: ‘TheHoly One is about to bring a flood upon the world, and to destroyit, so that there will remain but one man and his three sons.’”59InMidrash10b–11a, the reference to Noah and his three sons enduring theflood follows immediately after the symbolic depiction of the tree withthree branches surviving the destruction. Although theMidrashdoes notdirectly identify the tree with Noah, it makes the indentification obvi-ous by correlating these two descriptions.The same correlation is seen in3Apoc. Bar.4:10b–11, where the ref-erence to Noah and his escape follows immediately after the statementabout the preserved shoot: “and the water entered into the garden anddestroyed every flower, bringing out one shoot from the vine as Godwithdrew the waters. And there was dry land, and Noah went out fromthe ark.”60It is important, however, that the escaped “tree,” which intheBook of Giantswas associated with the righteous remnant, becomesassociated in3Baruchwith the evil deception. This difference mightpoint to the polemical character of3Baruch’s appropriation of Enochicimagery.the surface of the earth. TheBook of the Watchersand theBook of Giantsalso attest to theenormous appetites of the giants. TheMidrash of Shemhazai and Azaelhas it that “each ofthem eats daily a thousand camels, a thousand horses, a thousand oxen, and all kinds(of animals)” (trans. Milik,Books of Enoch,328).57Trans. Milik,Books of Enoch,328.58Associations of Noah with the plant abound. e.g.,1Enoch10:16:“Destroyallwrongfrom the face of the earth .... And let the plant of righteousness and truth appear”(Knibb,Ethiopic Book of Enoch,2.90). For a survey of the evidence, see Reeves,JewishLore,99–100.

It depicts the patriarch afterhis debarkation seeing the shoot of vine lying on the ground. Noahhesitates to plant the vine, knowing the fatal role this plant had indeceiving Adam and Eve. Puzzled, Noah decides to ask the Lord inprayer if he can plant the vine. The Lord sends the angel Sarasael,who delivers to Noah the following command: “Rise, Noah, and plantthe vine, and alter its name and change it for the better.”61Sarasael’saddress to Noah is important for establishing the connection between3Baruch4and the broader Enochic/Noahic traditions. It reveals thatthe author of3Baruchwas familiar not only with the details of Noah’sescape from the flood that are found in the extant materials of theBook of Giantsbut also with the peculiar details of Noah’s story in theBook of the Watchersand in the traditions associated with theBook ofNoah.The Greek and Ethiopic versions of1Enoch10:1–3attest that Godcommissioned Sariel to inform Noah about the approaching flood.62This story might possibly parallel Sarasael’s63revelation to Noah in3Apoc. Bar.4:15, but Sariel’s revelation in1Enoch10:1–3does not containany information about the plant. It may be, however, that the “original”reading of1Enoch10:3survived in its entirety not in the Ethiopic textof1Enochbut in the text preserved by Syncellus,64which correspondsclosely to the Aramaic evidence.65In the passage found in Syncellus,God commissioned Sariel to tell Noah not only about his escape fromthe flood but also about aplant: “And now instruct the righteous one61Gaylord, “3Baruch,”668.621Enoch10:1–3: “And then the Most High, the Great and Holy One, spoke andsent Arsyalalyur to the son of Lamech, and said to him: Say to him in my name‘Hide yourself,’ and reveal to him the end which is coming, for the whole earth willbe destroyed, and a deluge is about to come on all the earth, and what is in it will bedestroyed. And now teach him that he may escape, and (that) his offspring may survivefor the whole earth” (Knibb,Ethiopic Book of Enoch,2.87).63Sarasael represents here the corruption of Sariel, the angelic name of the arch-angel Uriel also known in various traditions under the name of Phanuel. On theUriel/Sariel/Phanuel connection, see “The Face as the Heavenly Counterpart of theVisionary in the SlavonicLadder of Jacob,” in:Of Scribes and Sages: Early Jewish Interpretationand Transmission of Scripture(2vols.; ed.

Thus,Jub.7:1, for example, says that “during the seventh week, inits first year, in this jubilee Noah planted a vine at the mountain (whosename was Lubar, one of the mountains of Ararat) on which the ark hadcome to rest. It produced fruit in the fourth year.”68Here, just as in3Apoc. Bar.4:13–15, the planting of the vine is associated with Noah’sdebarkation.Noah’s story as found in3Apoc. Bar.4:11–16gives additional sup-port to the hypothesis about the existence of the materials associatedwith theBook of Noah. F. García Martínez’s pioneering research demon-strates that the materials of theBook of Noahare closely associated withthe Enochic/Noachic traditions found in1Enoch,Jubilees, the Qumranmaterials, and Syncellus.69In3Baruch4several traditions associatedwith theBook of Noahappear to be intimately interconnected, whichmay point to their common origin in theBook of Noah. For example,In3Apoc. Bar.4:15–17, Sarasael tells Noah about the dangers of thevine. The angel tells him that the plant still retains its evil. This revela-tion aboutthe plant and the evil it possessesrecalls another passage possiblyassociated with theBook of Noah, namely, the tradition about the angelic66Black,Book of Enoch,30.67P.A.

In addition to the titles of the lostBook of Noah, several fragmentary materialsassociated with the early Noachic traditions have survived.

The foregoing analysis has demonstrated a number of intriguing par-allels between the theme of the garden in3Baruch4and similar tra-ditions associated with the materials of theBook of Giants.71In bothaccounts, the garden is depicted as the place of the primordial heav-enly rebellion involving angelic being(s). Although3Baruch4is writ-ten from the Adamic perspective,72this account demonstrates severaldetails that are absent from “traditional” Adamic accounts but can befound in the Enochic tradition. This suggests that the author of3Baruchmight be involved in anti-Enochic polemics, borrowing and rewrit-ing Enochic motifs and themes from the Adamic perspective. There-fore, the story of the planting and the destruction of the garden in3Baruchseems to represent the locus of intense debates involving sub-stantial rewriting of the “original” Enochic/Noahic motifs and themes.The details of the Enochic Watchers/Giants story appear to be rear-ranged73and transferred to new characters of the Adamic story, includ-ing Samael/Sataniel and the serpent.7470Jub.10:11b–14“All of the evil ones who were savage we tied up in the place ofjudgement, while we left a tenth of them to exercise power on the earth before thesatan. We told Noah all the medicines for their diseases with their deceptions so thathe could cure (them) by means of the earth’s plants. Noah wrote down in a bookeverything (just) as we had taught him regarding all the kinds of medicine, and the evilspirits were precluded from pursuing Noah’s children. He gave all the books that hehad written to his oldest son Shem because he loved him much more than all his sons”(VanderKam,Book of Jubilees,2.60).71The analysis demonstrates that, among the Jewish and Manichean materialsassociated with theBook of Giants,theMidrash of Shemhazai and Azaelshows the closestproximity to the traditions about the garden found in3Baruch4.723Baruch4appears to be one of the texts where the Adamic tradition plays aprominent role. Scholars have previously noted that Adamic and Enochic/Noachictraditions often compete with each other, offering different interpretations of the originsof evil in the world and the agents responsible for the transgression. In the course of thelong-lasting polemics about these matters, Adamic and Enochic traditions often alludereciprocally to the motifs and themes of both. For a detailed discussion of this subject,see Stone, “Axis of History at Qumran,”133–149.73Harlow (Greek Apocalypse of Baruch,59) noted that the author of3Baruch4“put theWatchers’mythonitshead.”74The depiction of the serpent in3Baruchseems to allude to the enormous appetites"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"308the adam tradition2. The author of3Baruchseems to be engaged in anti-Enochic polemicsnot only with the traditions associated with theBook of Giantsbut alsowith the Enochic motifs and themes found in theBook of the Watchers,theBook of Jubilees, and Syncellus. It appears that even the theme ofthe flooding of the heavenly garden represents an anti-Enochic motif.Jubilees4depicts Enoch as the one who was translated to the garden ofEden.Jubilees4:23further tells that because of Enoch “the flood waterdid not come on any of the land of Eden because he was placed thereas a sign and to testify against all people in order to tell all the deeds ofhistory until the day of judgment.”753. A substantial part of3Baruch4is occupied by the Noachic account,and the Noachic tradition found in3Baruch4is closely connectedwith the fragments of theBook of Noahfound in1Enoch,Jubilees,theDead Sea Scroll fragments, and Syncellus. It appears, however, thatthe Noachic materials found in3Baruch4have also undergone the“Adamic” revisions. H.E. Gaylord observes that “a strong typologicalrelation is set up between Adam and Noah, who discovers a piece of thevine through which Adam and Eve sinned washed out of the garden bythe receding floodwaters.”76of the giants; see3Apoc. Bar.4:3“And he showed me a plain, and there was a serpenton a stone mountain. And it drinks one cubit of water from the sea every day, and iteats earth like grass” (Gaylord, “3Baruch,”666).75VanderKam,Book of Jubilees,2.28.76Gaylord, “3Baruch,”659."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"THE MOSES TRADITION"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"EX 33 ON GOD’S FACE:A LESSON FROM THE ENOCHIC TRADITIONExodus33:18–23depicts Moses who asks the Lord to show him Hisglory. Instead the Lord agrees to proclaim his name before Moses,telling him that it is impossible for a human being to see God’s face.In recent scholarship this prominent motif of Moses’ story has be-come a stumbling block for students of the Hebrew Bible. Currentlymost biblical scholars agree upon apparent difficulties in the literary-critical analysis of this section of Exodus. M. Noth comments that “aliterary-critical analysis of Exodus33is probably impossible.”1B. Childsconfirms that there are several fundamental exegetical problems withExodus33:18–23. “The most difficult one is to determine the role ofthis passage in its larger context.”2The internal logic of the passage about the Divine face is alsoproblematic. The whole narrative about God’s\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005in Ex33is quiteperplexing. Ex33:11informs a reader that God would speak to Mosesface to face (\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u000f\u000e\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005) as a man speaks with his friend. A few verseslater, in33:14–15, God promises Moses that His face will go (\f\u0015\u000f\u0003\u0003\u0004\u0005)with him. In the context of these promises and early testimonies about“face-to-face” relationships, it comes as a surprise that in33:20theLord suddenly rejects Moses’ request to see His face (\u0013\u000e\u0007\u000f\u000f\u0015\f\u0013\u000e\u000f\u0003\u0004\u0005\u001e\u0013\u000e).It is clear that the anthropomorphic tradition about the divine facein Ex33has a fragmentary character.3It may well contain polemicsbetween the anthropomorphic position of the J source and the Deuter-onomic theology of the divine name: instead of the seeing of God’s1M.

Nothobserves that Ex33can be seen as “a conglomeration of secondaryaccretions.”5The apparent difficulties one encounters in clarifying the conceptof the divine face within the context of the known sources of thePentateuch call for an investigation of the broader biblical and extra-biblical traditions where this motif could be possibly preserved in itsextended form. Implicitly linked to the “original” Exodus motif, theselater “interpretations” might provide some additional insights whichmay help us better understand the fragmentary tradition preserved inchapter33. This study will focus on one of the possible echoes of Ex33—the theophanic tradition of the divine countenance preserved inthe corpus of the Enochic writings.4The Old Testament materials reveal complicated polemics for and against anthro-pomorphic understanding of God. Scholars agree that the anthropomorphic imageryof the Hebrew Bible was “crystallized” in the tradition, known to us as the Priestlysource. Moshe Weinfeld,Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomic School(Oxford: ClarendonPress,1972),191. Theological developments of the Priestly tradition demonstrate thatthe anthropomorphism of the Priestly source is intimately connected with the place ofDivine habitation. In this tradition, “in which the Divinity is personalized and depictedin the most tangible corporeal similitudes,” God, who possesses a human form, has aneed for a house or tabernacle. (Weinfeld,Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomic School,191).Weinfeld rightly observes that this anthropomorphic position was not entirely an inven-tion of the Priestly source, but derives from early sacral conceptions found in the earlysourses. In these traditions the Deity was sitting in his house ensconced between the twocherubim, and at his feet rests the ark, his footstool. In spite of the active promulgationof anthropomorphic concepts in some Old Testament materials, like J, P, and Ezekeliansources, the Hebrew Bible also contains polemics against God’s corporeality. Scholarsnote the sharp opposition of the book of Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomic schoolto the anthropomorphism of the Priestly source and early anthropomorphic traditions.In their opinion, Deuteronomic school “first initiated the polemic against the anthro-pomorphic and corporeal conceptions of the Deity and that it was afterwards taken upby the prophets Jeremiah and Deutero-Isaiah.” (Weinfeld,Deuteronomy and the Deutero-nomic School,198). In contrast to the anthropomorphic imagery of J and P, the Deutero-nomic school promulgates anticorporeal theology of “divine name” with its conceptionof sanctuary (tabernacle) as the place where only God’s name dwells. On Deutero-nomic antianthropomorphism, see T.N.D. Mettinger,The Dethronement of Sabaoth. Studiesin the Shem and Kabod Theologies(Coniectanea Biblica.

Who can give an account of hisbeautiful appearance, never changing and indescribable, and his greatglory? And I fell down flat and did obeisance to the Lord (2Enoch22:1–4,the longer recension).6In chapter39Enoch reports this theophanic experience to his sonsduring his short visit to the earth, adding some new details. Althoughboth portrayals demonstrate a number of terminological affinities, thesecond account explicitly connects the divine face with the Lord’santhropomorphic “extent.” The following account is drawn from theshorter recension of2Enoch:And now, my children it is not from my lips that I am reporting to youtoday, but from the lips of the Lord who has sent me to you. As foryou, you hear my words, out of my lips, a human being created equalto yourselves; but I have heard the words from the fiery lips of theLord. For the lips of the Lord are a furnace of fire, and his words are6Andersen, “2Enoch,”136. The shorter recension of the Slavonic text gives a lesselaborated description of the Lord’s appearance: “I saw the Lord. His face was strongand very glorious and terrible. Who (is) to give an account of the dimensions of thebeing of the face of the Lord, strong and very terrible? Or his many-eyed ones andmany-voiced ones, and the supremely great throne of the Lord, not made by hands, orthose who are in attendance all around him, the cherubim and the seraphim armies, orhow unvarying and indescribable and never-silent and glorious is his service. and I felldown flat and did obeisance to the Lord.” Cf. Andersen, “2Enoch,”137.Andersenobserves that the absence of the comparison with hot iron in MSS of the shorterrecension shows the embarrassment of scribes over this attempt to describe the Lord’sappearance.

It is not a coincidence that in both of them the “face”is associated with light and fire. In biblical theophanies smoke and fireoften serve as a divine envelope that protects mortals from the sightof the divine form. Radiant luminosity emitted by the Deity fulfills thesame function, signaling the danger of the direct vision of the divineform. Luminosity also represents the screen which protects the Deityfrom the necessity of revealing its true form. Scholars note that insome theophanic traditions God’s form remains hidden behind Hislight.11The hidden\u000b\f\u0016\u0015is revealed through this light, which servesas the luminous screen, “the face” of this anthropomorphic extent.2Enoch’stheophanies which use the metaphors of light and fire maywell be connected with such traditions where the divine “extent” is7Slav.lice Gospodne.8The important detail of this description is solar symbolism, which plays an impor-tant role in2Enoch. The text often uses solar metaphors in various descriptions ofangelic beings; e.g., in chapter1where Enoch meets two angels with “faces like theshining sun.” Later, during his heavenly journey, Enoch sees “a group of seven angels,brilliant and very glorious with faces more radiant than the radiance of the sun.”The images of fire and light are often involved in these solar descriptions of angelichosts.

And you see the formof my body, the same as your own; but I have seen the form (extent) ofthe Lord, without measure and without analogy, who has no end (2Enoch39:3–6).The association between the divine face and divine form in2Enoch39:3–6alludes to the biblical tradition from Ex33:18–23where thedivinepanimis mentioned in connection with his glorious divine form—God’sKavod:13Then Moses said, “Now show me your glory (\u0010\u000b\u0016\u0015).” And the Lord said,“I will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you, and I will proclaimmy name, the Lord, in your presence... but,” he said, “you cannot seemy face (\u0003\u0004\u0005), for no one may see me and live.”It is clear that in the biblical passage the impossibility of seeing theLord’s face is understood not simply as the impossibility of seeing theparticular part of the Lord but rather as the impossibility of seeing thecomplete range of His glorious “body.” The logic of the whole passage,which employs such terms as God’s “face” and God’s “back,” suggeststhat the termpanimrefers to the “forefront” of the divine extent.

The text gives a number of evidences which prove that theanthropomorphic “extent,” identified with the divine face, indeed rep-resents HisKavod. The theophany of the divine countenance in theSlavonic apocalypse is surrounded by a peculiarKavodimagery, whichplays a prominent role in the Ezekelian account. The following paral-lels are noteworthy:1. The theophany of the divine face took place in the highest of theheaven.21The highest of the heaven is a traditional place of God’sThrone, the abode of His Glory.

A reference to the “many-voiced ones” probably alludes to choirs ofangelic hosts surrounding the Throne.4. Finally, in2Enoch22there is a direct reference to the throne of theLord, which occupies a central place in the theophanic description, andis pictured as “supremely great and not made by hands.”24The Throneof Glory is surrounded by the armies of the angelic hosts, cherubimand the seraphim, with “their never-silent singing.”25Moses’ FacePrevious research shows that the correlation between God’s face andhis luminous form (his gloriousKavod) was already implicitly articulatedin Ex33. The Enochic theophany found in2Enochfurther strengthensthis connection, giving a theophanic description of the Lord’s face ashis terrifying “extent” which emits light and fire.The important detail of these two accounts is the “danger motif ”—the warnings about the peril of seeing the Deity. Both of them containspecific references to the harmful effect this theophanic experiencehas on the mortals who dare to behold the Divine face. In Ex33:20the Lord warns Moses about the danger of seeing His face: “Youcannot see my face, for no one may see me and live.” The motif ofperil is further reinforced by the Lord’s instructions in33:22where hecommands Moses to hide himself into a cleft in the rock and promisesto protect the prophet with His hands.The “danger motif ” also looms large in2Enoch.In2Enoch39, imme-diately after his description of the theophany of the face, Enoch giveswarning to his children about the danger of this theophanic experi-ence:Frightening and dangerous it is to stand before the face of an earthlyking, terrifying and very dangerous it is, because the will of the king isdeath and the will of the king is life. How much more terrifying [anddangerous] it is to stand before the face of the King of earthly kings andof the heavenly armies, [the regulator of the living and of the dead].Who can endure that endless misery?

M. Weinfeld argues that the warning aboutthe danger of seeing the Deity usually affirms the possibility of such anexperience. In his observations about antianthropomorphic tendenciesof Deuteronomy, Deutero-Isaiah and Jeremiah, he points to the factthat these texts demonstrate a lack of usual warnings about the dangerof seeing the Deity found in pre-Deuteronomic books. He concludesthat it happened because the Deuteronomic school cannot conceive ofthe possibility of seeing the Deity.27The possibility of theophany hinted at in2Enochand Ex33mightsuggest that Exodus’ account implicitly asserts that Moses could see thedivine form.28The distinctive details in the depiction of Moses’ face inEx34may further support this conclusion. But before we explore thismotif, let us again return to the narrative of2Enoch.From this Enochic account we learn that the vision of the Divineface had dramatic consequences for Enoch’s appearance. His bodyendures radical changes as it becomes covered with the divine light.The important detail here is that the luminous transformation of Enochtakes place in front of the radiant “face” of the Lord. In22:6Enochreports that he was lifted up and brought before the Lord’s face byarchangel Michael. The Lord decides to appoint Enoch as\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007\b,the Prince of the Divine Presence: “Let Enoch come up and stand infront of my face forever.”29Further, the Lord commanded archangelMichael to remove Enoch from earthly clothing, anoint him with thedelightful oil, and put him into the clothes of the Lord’s glory (22:8–9).30The text describes the actions of Michael, who anoints Enoch withthe delightful oil and clothes him. The symbolism of light permeatesthe whole scene; the oil emanates the rays of the glittering sun “greaterthan the greatest light.”31At the end of this procedure, Enoch “had27M. Weinfeld,Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomic School,207.28Another “Mosaic” account attributed to J, openly articulates this possibility: “Withhim (Moses) I speak mouth to mouth (\u0006\u0005\u000f\u000e\u0006\u0005), clearly and not in riddles; he sees theform (\u0013\u0004\u0012\u0013\f) of the Lord (Num12:8).”29Andersen, “2Enoch,”139.30Andersen, “2Enoch,”139.31Andersen, “2Enoch,”138. Jarl Fossum provides a number of allusions to thetheme of “shining oil” in2Enoch. Cf. J.

In2Enoch37we learn about the unusual pro-cedure performed on Enoch’s face on the final stage of his encounterwith the Lord. The text informs us that the Lord called one of hissenior angels to chill the face of Enoch. The text says that the angelappeared frigid; he was as white as snow, and his hands were as cold asice. The text further depicts the angel chilling Enoch’s face, who couldnot endure the terror of the Lord, “just as it is not possible to endurethe fire of a stove and the heat of the sun...”34Right after this “chill-ing procedure,” the Lord informs Enoch that if his face had not beenchilled here, no human being would be able to look at his face.35Thisreference to the radiance of Enoch’s face after his encounter with theLord is an apparent parallel to the incandescent face of Moses after theSinai experience in Ex34.36References to the shining countenance of a visionary found in2Enochreturn us again to the Exodus story. Ex34:29–35portrays Moses afterhis encounter with the Lord.37The passage tells that “when Mosescame down from Mount Sinai ... he was not aware that his face wasradiant, because he had spoken with the Lord.” The strange logic ofthe last sentence, which points to anambiguous connection betweenthe speech of the Lord as a cause of Moses’ glowing face can be32Andersen observes that “this motif (Enoch’s transformation into the gloriousangel) seems to have been influenced by the legend of Moses, whose shining face was areflection of God’s magnificent glory.” Andersen, “2Enoch,”139.33Andersen, “2Enoch,”139.34Andersen,160.35Andersen,160.36About possible Mesopotamian provenance of this motif cf.: M.

As will be demonstrated later, the con-nection between the Enochic and Mosaic accounts has quite ancientroots. Evidences of the early link between Enoch and Moses includesthe already mentioned drama of Ezekiel the Tragedian, which wasapparently written during the second century BCE.39W. Meeks40and P.W. van der Horst41observe that the depiction ofMoses in the drama of Ezekiel the Tragedian bears some similaritiesto Enoch’s figure in the Enochic traditions. They note a number ofremarkable allusions in the drama to the Enochic motifs and themes.These allusions include the following points:1. Moses’s account is depicted as his dream vision in a fashion simi-lar to Enoch’s dreams in1Enochand2Enoch.2. In the text Moses is “elevated” by God, who gives him the throne,the royal diadem,42and the scepter.3. God appointed Moses as an eschatological judge of humankindable to see “things present, past and future”43—the traditional roleof Enoch found already in early Enochic booklets.4. Moses is an “expert” in “a variety of things,” including cosmolog-ical and astronomical information:I beheld the entire circled earthBoth beneath the earth and above the heaven,And a host of stars fell on its knees before me;I numbered them all,They passed before me like a squadron of soldiers.4438Andersen,163.39C.R.

One of its interesting details is that Mesopotamian kings, as well as patriarchs fromGenesis’ account, had extraordinary long reigns, ranging from3,600to72,000years.A second important parallel is that two versions of the List give ten kings, the last ofwhom is designated as the hero of the flood. It demonstrates a close resemblance tothe role of Noah who occupies the tenth place in the list of Genesis5.J.VanderKamnotes that “in the literature on Genesis5there is a well established tradition whichholds that P modeled his pre-flood genealogy on a Mesopotamian list of antediluviankings, the so-called Sumerian King List.” VanderKam,26.Animportantcharacterofthe Sumerian King list is Enmeduranki (Enmeduranna), the king of Sippar, the city ofthe sun-godˇSamaˇs.

Unfortunately, the fragmentary character of the Qum-ran document does not allow us to grasp the full scope and intentionsof the author(s) of4Q504in making such a juxtaposition. To understandthis juxtaposition better, research must proceed to other sources wherethe association between the glory of Adam and Moses was made moreexplicit. One of such sources includes the Macarian Homilies, wherethe author vividly accentuates this association. However, before ourresearch proceeds to a detailed analysis of the Adam/Moses connectionin the Dead Sea Scrolls and in the Macarian homilies, a short intro-duction to the Jewish, Samaritan, and Christian materials about theglorious garments of Adam and the glorious face of Moses is needed.The Background: The Garments of LightThe Biblical passages found in Gen1:26–27and Gen3:21represent twopivotal starting points for the subsequent Jewish and Christian reflec-tions on the glorious garments of Adam and Eve. Gen1:26describesthe creation of human being(s) after the likeness (\u0013\f\u0012\u000b) of the image(\u0002\u000f\u001d) of God. It is noteworthy that Gen1:26–27refers to the\u0002\u000f\u001d(tse-lem) of Adam, the luminous image of God’s glory according to whichAdam was created.5The particular interest in Gen1:26is that Adam’stselemwas created after God’s owntselem(\f\u0004\u0012\u000f\u001d\u0016) (literally “in ourtse-lem”), being a luminous “imitation” of the glorioustselemof God. Somescholars argue that the likeness that Adam and God shared was notphysicality—in the usual sense of having a body—but rather lumines-cence.6The Targums, the Aramaic renderings of the Hebrew Bible, alsoattest to the prelapsarian luminosity of Adam and Eve in the Garden ofEden. The Biblical background for such traditions includes the passage5For discussions about the luminous body of Adam, see: David H.

Meir’s Torah it was found writ-ten, ‘Garments of light: this refers to Adam’s garments, which were likea torch [shedding radiance], broad at the bottom and narrow at thetop.’”9It is usually understood that Gen3:21refers to God clothing Adamand Eve’s nakedness after the Fall. S. Brock, however, argues that suffi-cient evidence exist to suggest that there also was another way of under-standing the time reference of Gen3:21. According to this alternativeunderstanding the verbs are to be taken as pluperfects, referring to thestatus of Adam and Eve at their creation before the Fall.10It is noteworthy that in the later Jewish and Samaritan sources, thestory about Adam’s luminous garments is often mentioned in conjunc-tion with Moses’ story. In these materials, Moses is often depicted as aluminous counterpart of Adam.7In Targum Pseudo-Jonathan on Gen3:21the following tradition can be found:“And the Lord God made garments of glory for Adam and for his wife from theskin which the serpent had cast off(to be worn) on the skin of their (garments of)fingernails of which they had been stripped, and he clothed them.”Targum Pseudo-Jonathan: Genesis(tr.

The Samaritan texts insistthat when Moses ascended to Mount Sinai, he received the imageof God which Adam cast offin the Garden of Eden.11According toMemar Marqah, Moses was endowed with the identical glorious body asAdam.12Memar Marqah5.4tells us that: “He [Moses] was vested withthe form which Adam cast offin the Garden of Eden; and his faceshone up to the day of his death.”13The Adam/Moses connection also looms large in the rabbinicsources. Alon Goshen Gottstein stresses that “the luminescent qualityof the image (tselem) is the basis for comparison between Moses andAdam in several rabbinical materials.”14Deuteronomy Rabbah11.3offers important witness to the Adam/Mosesconnection. It includes the following passage in which two “luminaries”argue whose glory is the greatest:Adam said to Moses: “I am greater than you because I have been createdin the image of God.” Whence this? For it is said, “and God created manin his own image” (Gen.1,27). Moses replied to him: “I am far superiorto you, for the honor which was given to you has been taken away fromyou, as it is said: but man (Adam) abideth not in honor, (Ps. XLIX,13)but as for me, the radiant countenance which God gave me still remainswith me.” Whence? For it is said: “his eye was not dim, nor his naturalforce abated” (Deut.34,7).15Goshen Gottstein draws attention to another significant midrashic pas-sage fromMidrash Tadshe4, in which Moses poses Adam’s luminouscounterpart. The tradition tells that...in the likeness of the creation of the world the Holy One blessed behe performed miracles for Israel when they came out of Egypt... In thebeginning: “and God created man in his image,” and in the desert: “andMoshe knew not that the skin of his face shone.”1611J.

Thus, as an example, inLeviticus Rabbah20.2, the following passage can be found:Resh Lakish, in the name of R. Simeon the son of Menasya, said: Theapple of Adam’s heel outshone the globe of the sun; how much more sothebrightness of his face! Nor need you wonder. In the ordinary way if aperson makes salvers, one for himself and one for his household, whosewill he make more beautiful? Not his own? Similarly, Adam was createdfor the service of the Holy One, blessed be He, and the globe of the sunfor the service of mankind.18Genesis Rabbah11also focuses, not on Adam’s luminous garments, butrather on his glorious face:Adam’s glory did not abide the night with him. What is the proof ?But Adam passeth not the night in glory (Ps. XLIX,13). The Rabbismaintain: His glory abode with him, but at the termination of theSabbath He deprived him of his splendor and expelled him from theGarden of Eden, as it is written, Thou changesthis countenance,andsendest him away (Job XIV,20).19Despite the importance of these late rabbinic passages linking the lumi-nosity of Adam’s body and Moses’ face, the chronological boundariesof these evidences are difficult to establish. Rabbinic attestations to theAdam–Moses connection are also very succinct and sometimes lack anysystematic development.Much more extensive expositions of the traditions about Moses asthe heavenly counterpart of Adam can be found in the writings ofthe fourth century Christian author, the Syrian father, known to us asPseudo-Macarius.17According to Jewish sources, the image of God was reflected especially in theradiance of Adam’s face.

In his employment of the Adam–Moses connec-tion, the author of the Macarian Homilies reveals profound knowledgeof the Jewish and Christian esoteric traditions about the glorious mani-festations of Adam and Moses.The story of Adam serves for the homilist as the starting point of histheology of the divine light. Thus, from the homily II.1222the reader20This feature of the Macarian Homilies serves as additional proof of the closerelationship between Pseudo-Macarius and the various Syriac developments in whichthe theme of Adam’s garments plays an important theological role. S. Brock notes theextensive usage of the “clothing” metaphors in the Syriac tradition. He shows that thisimagery is closely connected with Adam Christology: “... the first Adam loses the robeof glory at the Fall; the second Adam puts on the body of the first Adam in order torestore the robe of glory....” Brock, “Clothing Metaphors as a Means of TheologicalExpression in Syriac Tradition,”16.21The traditions about the glorious garments of Adam and Eve were widespreadin the Syriac sources. [For a detailed discussion of this subject, see: De Conick,Seek toSee Him: Ascent and Vision Mysticism in the Gospel of Thomas,157–172; Brock, “ClothingMetaphors as a Means of Theological Expression in Syriac Tradition,”11–38]. Itis possible that the early Syrian authors gained access to such traditions throughtheir familiarity with the Targums, the Aramaic renderings of the Hebrew Bible. TheMacarian Homilies, which were connected with the Syrian milieu, demonstrate thattheir author was exposed to a great variety of the Jewish and Christian traditions aboutthe luminous garments of the first humans.22There are four Byzantine medieval collections of Macarian Homilies. Three ofthem appeared in critical editions. Collection I was published inMakarios/Simeon: Redenund Briefe. Die Sammlung I des Vaticanus Graecus694(B)(2vols.; ed. H.

Second, he lost the very image itself (α\u0019τ4ν τ4ν ε/-κ%να) in which was laid up for him, according to God’s promise, thefull heavenly inheritance” (II.12.1).23Further, another important pas-sage in the same homily informs the reader that Adam and Eve beforethe Fall were clothed (\u001eνδεδυμ\u0015ν\u0011ι) with God’s glory in place of cloth-ing (II.12.8).24The homily shows a certain continuity between Adam’s“very image itself ” and his glorious clothing. An important detail inthe narrative is that the homilist makes a distinction between Adam’snature, created after the image and likeness of God, and Adam’s “veryimage itself,” he speaks of them as of two separate entities whichwere lost during the Fall. This subtle theological distinction showsthe author’s familiarity with the Jewish aggadic traditions about thetselemof Adam—the luminous image of God’s glory according towhich the first human being was created. The Macarian association ofAdam’s garments and his creation after the luminous image of Godpoints us again to the Qumran passage from4Q504, where Adam isdepicted as the one who was “fashioned” in the image of God’s glory.It should be noted that besides this reference to “image,” both textsentertain several other parallels that reveal similarities between theAdamic story in the Macarian Homilies and the Adamic traditions atQumran.First, the Qumran Adamic account in4Q5048is distinctive in that itconnects Adam’s glorious state25with his ability to exercise dominion26over the rest of creation.4Q5048reads:23Pseudo-Macarius,The Fifty Spiritual Homilies and the Great Letter(tr.

For the Word himself was his inheritance, his covering, andaglorythat was his defense (Is4:5). He was his teaching. Forhe taught himhow to give names to all things: “Give this name of heaven, that the sun; thisthe moon; that earth; this a bird; that a beast; that a tree.” As he wasinstructed, so he named them.29A second important detail that connects the Adamic tradition at Qum-ran with Macarian writings is that the luminous image (tselem) of Adamin the Macarian Homilies is termed as “the full heavenly inheritance.”30In II.12.1, it is also associated with a very valuable estate:...he lost the very image itself in which was laid up for him, accordingto God’s promise, the full heavenly inheritance (κληρ\u0011ν\u0011μ\u000eα). Take theexample of a coin bearing the image of the king. If it were mixed with afalse alloy and lost its gold content, the image also would lose its value.Such, indeed, happened to Adam. A very great richness and inheritancewas prepared for him. It was as though there were a large estate and itpossessed many sources of income. It had a fruitful vineyard; there werefertile fields, flocks, gold and silver. Such was the vessel of Adam beforehis disobedience like a very valuable estate.31The terminology found in this Macarian passage seems to allude to theQumran Adamic materials, which also refer to Adam’s “inheritance.”Thus, the Qumran Pesher on Psalms (4Q171) contains a reference tothe inheritance of Adam (\u0002\u000b\u000e\u0013\u000f\u0011\u0004) which the Israelites will have in thefuture:...those who have returned from the wilderness, who will live for athousand generations, in salva[tio]n; for them there is all the inheritanceof Adam (\u0002\u000b\u000e\u0013\u000f\u0011\u0004), and for their descendants for ever...3227García Martínez and Tigchelaar (eds.),The Dead Sea Scrolls Study Edition,2.1009.28Cf. also Gen1:26.29Pseudo-Macarius,The Fifty Spiritual Homilies and the Great Letter,99.30Pseudo-Macarius,The Fifty Spiritual Homilies and the Great Letter,97.31Pseudo-Macarius,The Fifty Spiritual Homilies and the Great Letter,97.324Q171 3:1–2.

The reference tothe vineyard is intriguing since in4Q171the term, the “inheritance” ofAdam, is closely associated with the Temple36and the Temple moun-tain.37The foregoing analysis shows that the theme of Adam’s heavenlygarments plays an important role in the theological universe of theMacarian Homilies. The homilist, however, does not follow blindlythese ancient traditions, but, incorporates them into the fabric of theChristian story. The Adamic narrative, therefore, represents an essentialpart of the Macarian “glory” Christology, where the lost luminousgarment of the First Adam has to be restored by the glory of theSecond Adam, Christ. The Second Adam thus must put on the bodyof the first Adam in order to restore the lost clothes of the divine light,which now has to be acquired by the believers at their resurrection.However, in Macarian writings this “glory” Christology is not simplyconfined to the Adam–Christ dichotomy but includes a third importantelement, namely, the story of Moses, whose glorious face serves as theprototypefor the future glory of Christ at the Transfiguration.38The radi-ance of the patriarch’s face remains in the Macarian Homilies to be themediating point between the former glory of Adam lost in the Paradise33M.O.

Thus, in the Homily II.5.10–11,Macarius describes Moses’ glorious face as the prototype of the futureglory:...For the blessed Moses provided us witha certain type(τ\u001bν τ!π\u0011ν)through the glory of the Spirit which covered his countenance uponwhich no one could look with steadfast gaze. This type anticipates howin the resurrection of the just the body of the saints will be glorified witha glory which even now the souls of the saintly and faithful people aredeemed worthy to possess within, in the indwelling of the inner man....39In his presentation of the shining appearance of Moses, the homilist,however, makes a clear distinction between the glory of Moses at Sinaiand the glory of Christ at the Transfiguration. Moses’ glory is only a“prototype” of God’s “true” glory. Macarius’ understanding of Moses’glory as the prototype (τ!π\u0011ς) or the figure of the “true glory” isobservable, for example, in the Homily II.47.1:...The glory of Moses which he received on his countenance wasafigure of the true glory(τ!π\u0011ς :ν τ$ς 'λη,ιν$ς δ% ης). Just as the Jews wereunable “to look steadfastly upon the face of Moses” (2Cor3:7), so nowChristians receive that glory of light in their souls, and the darkness, notbearing the splendor of the light, is blinded and is put to fight.40Another feature of Moses’ glorification is that Moses’ luminous facewas only “covered” with God’s glory in the same way as the luminousgarments covered the body of the first humans. According to Macarius,Moses’ luminosity was not able to penetrate human nature and removethe inner garments of darkness bestowed by the devil on the humanheart.41In II.32.4, the Syrian father affirms that:39Pseudo-Macarius,The Fifty Spiritual Homilies and the Great Letter,74;Dörries,62.TheHomily II.5.11repeats the same idea again: “In a double way, therefore, the blessedMoses shows us what glory true Christians will receive in the resurrection: namely,the glory of light and the spiritual delights of Spirit which even now they are deemedworthy to possess interiorly.” Pseudo-Macarius,The Fifty Spiritual Homilies and the GreatLetter,74.40Homily II.47.1. Pseudo-Macarius,The Fifty Spiritual Homilies and the Great Letter,232;Dörries,304.41The Macarian motif of the garments of darkness bestowed by Satan on thefirst humans brings us to the connection between the Macarian Homilies and thetargumic traditions. It has been mentioned previously that the Syrian authors mighthave acquired their knowledge of the Jewish aggadic traditions about the luminosityof the garments of Adam and Eve via their familiarity with the targumic texts. Some"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"338the moses tradition...Moses, having been clothed in the flesh, was unable to enter into theheart and take away the sordid garments of darkness.42For Macarius, only the glory of Christ is able to remove the attire ofdarkness and “heal” the human heart. It is, therefore, observable thatfor the Syrian father the glory of Moses shows a greater typologicalaffinity to the glory of Adam43than to the glory of Christ.A decisive feature of the Macarian Homilies is that the homilist oftenemphasizes the connection between the luminosity of Adam’s heavenlyattire lost in the Paradise and the luminosity of Moses’ face acquired onMount Sinai. In the Macarian Homilies, the motif of Moses’ gloriousface seems to serve as a sign of the partial restoration of the formerfeatures of Adam’s story found in the Macarian Homilies point in this direction. Forexample, the Homily II.1.7tells that when “... Adam violated the command of Godand obeyed the deceitful serpent he sold himself to the devil and that evil one puton Adam’s soul as his garment—that most beautiful creature that God had fashionedaccording to his own image....” [Pseudo-Macarius,The Fifty Spiritual Homilies and theGreat Letter,41]. This motif of Adam being clothed with the evil one as his garmentseems to allude to the targumic tradition which attests to the fact that God madegarments for Adam and Eve from the skin which the serpent had cast off.TheTargumPseudo-Jonathan on Gen3:21tells that: “And the Lord God made garments of glory forAdam and for his wife from the skin which the serpent had cast off(to be worn) on theskin of their (garments of) fingernails of which they had been stripped, and he clothedthem.” [Targum Pseudo-Jonathan: Genesis(tr. M. Maher, M.S.C.; AB,1B; Collegeville:Liturgical Press,1992),29]. It seems, however, that the author of the Macarian Homiliessubstantially edits this targumic tradition. In the Macarian Homilies, the garments ofthe devil become the attire of darkness in contrast to the Palestinian Targum, wherethey are depicted as the garments of light. On the garments of darkness, cf. also theHomily II.30.7: “In that day when Adam fell, God came walking in the garden. Hewept, so to speak, seeing Adam and he said: ‘After such good things, what evils youhave chosen! After such glory, what shame you now bear! What darkness are you now!What ugly form you are! What corruption! From such light, what darkness has coveredyou!’ When Adam fell and was dead in the eyes of God, the Creator wept over him.The angels, all the powers, the heavens, the earth and all creatures bewailed his deathand fall. For they saw him, who had been given to them as their king, now become aservantofanopposingandevilpower.Therefore,darknessbecamethegarmentofhissoul, a bitter and evil darkness, for he was made a subject of the prince of darkness.”Pseudo-Macarius,The Fifty Spiritual Homilies and the Great Letter,192–193.42Pseudo-Macarius,The Fifty Spiritual Homilies and the Great Letter,198.43Cf. the Homily I.2.3.14: “I think that the glorified face of Moses was a type (τ!π\u0011ς)and teaching of the first Adam, formed by the hands of God, which death saw andwas wounded by it, not being able to look on it, and fearing that its kingdom would bedissolved and destroyed—which, with the Lord, did in fact occur.” Alexander Golitzin,The Macarian Homilies from Collection I,3(forthcoming);Makarios/Simeon: Reden und Briefe.Die Sammlung I des Vaticanus Graecus694(B),1.9.

Moses’glorious face is, therefore, viewed by the homilist as the counterpartof the glorious garment of Adam. The conflation of the two “glories,”lost and acquired, is observable, for instance, in the Homily II.12. Afterthe already mentioned Adamic narrative of Homily II.12, which tellsus how Adam lost his luminous status and “obeyed his darker side,”Macarius sets before the reader the example of Moses as the one who“had a glory shining on his countenance.”45The Healing MotifThe employment of the Adam/Moses connection in the Qumran ma-terials does not seem to be confined solely to4Q504. There is anotherimportant document which appears to entertain a similar connection.In the Qumran fragment4Q374, also known as theDiscourse on theExodus/Conquest Tradition,46the portentous clause can be found whichconnects Moses’ shining countenance47at the Sinai encounter48with44Cf. the Homily I.2.3.14“Now, I think that when the enemy saw the original gloryof Adam on the face of Moses, he was wounded because [he understood that] hiskingdom was going to be taken away.” Alexander Golitzin,The Macarian Homilies fromCollection I,3(forthcoming).45“...Indeed, the Word of God was his food and he had a glory shining on hiscountenance. All this, which happened to him, was a figure of something else. For thatglory now shines splendidly from within the hearts of Christians. At the resurrectiontheir bodies, as they rise, will be covered (σκεπ6+εται) with another vesture, one that isdivine, and they will be nourished with a heavenly food.” (II.12.14).

Cf. Fletcher-Louis,"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"340the moses traditionthe motif of healing. The passage unveils the following tradition: “[But]he (Moses) had pity with [...] and when he let his face shine for themfor healing(\u000e\u0005\u0007\u0012\u000f), they strengthened [their] hearts again...”49In this passage, as in4Q504, God’s glory is described as manifestedthrough Moses’ shining face. It appears that the passage is related tothe ongoing discussion about the luminosity of Moses and Adam. Hereagain, as in the case of4Q504, the evidence found in the MacarianHomilies helps to clarify the possible connection.The Homily II.20describes Christ as the true physician of humannature who can heal the human soul and adorn it with the garmentsof his grace. It is evident that the theme of healing is interwoven inthe homily with the motif of the luminous garments. In unfolding thistheme, the homilist, first, retells the Gospel story about the woman whowas cured of the blood flow by touching of the garment of the Lord,and connects the motif of healing with the theme of the garments:...and again just as the woman afflicted with an issue of blood believedtruly and touched the hem of the garment of the Lord and immediatelyreceived a healing and the flow of the unclean fountain of blood driedup...50Following the story of the healed woman, Macarius proceeds to theexamples of Adam and Moses. It is not a coincidence that in thishomily, as in4Q504, Moses’ name is mentioned in connection withthe theme of healing. From the homily II.20.6, we learn that “indeed,Moses came, but he was unable to bring a perfect healing ('λλ\u001d \u0011\u0019κ;δυν\u001f,η <ασιν παντελ$ δ\u00112ναι).”51The conflation of Moses’ figure withthe healing motif in the Macarian Homilies is intriguing since it mightindicate that the author of the Homilies draws on the traditions similarto those that can be found in4Q374.52“4Q374: A Discourse on the Sinai Tradition: The Deification of Moses and EarlyChristianity,”238.49García Martínez and Tigchelaar (eds.),The Dead Sea Scrolls Study Edition,2.740–741.50Pseudo-Macarius,The Fifty Spiritual Homilies and the Great Letter,151.51Pseudo-Macarius,The Fifty Spiritual Homilies and the Great Letter,151.Dörries,190.52Cf. also the Homily I.2.12.7–9: “...the devil, by means of a tree and serpent, usedjealousy and trickery to deceive Adam and Eve, and arranged [for them] to be thrownout of Paradise, and brought them down from their purity and glory to bitter passionsand death, and subsequently, having received from them the whole human race [tobe] under his power, caused [it] to stray into every sin and defiling passion ... byhis inexpressible wisdom, God, making provisions for humanity, send forth Moses thehealer to redeem the People through the wood of his staff... therefore half of piety wasset aright through Moses, and half of the passionshealed(/6,η)....” Alexander Golitzin,"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"vested with adam’sglory341The affinities between the healing motif found in the MacarianHomilies and in4Q374include another important feature. Both textsinterpret healing to be the healing of the human heart. The Qumranmaterial speaks that after the healing through Moses’ shining counte-nance the hearts of the Israelites were “strengthened” again.53The Homily II.20.7also links the motif of healing with the theme ofthe curing (or cleansing) of the human heart. It tells that “man could behealed only by the help of this medicine and thus could attain life by acleansing of his heart by the Holy Spirit.”54It seems that in both excerpts (4Q374and Macarian), the luminosityof Moses’ face plays an important role. Although the Macarian passagedoes not directly refer to the shining face of Moses, the context of thepassage, which deals with the garments of the Lord, indicates that inthe Macarian Homilies the motif of “healing” is understood as therestoration of the former Adamic glory, the glorious garments withwhich the first humans were clothed in Eden before their transgression.The author of the Homilies seems to view Moses’ shining face as animportant step in the process of the recovery of the former divine gloryonce manifested in humans during their life in Paradise. According tothe homilist, the glory would be restored in humanity only later, in theevent of the incarnation of Christ, which brings “perfect healing” to thewretched human nature. In this context, Moses’ shining face appears tobe an important, even if not a “final,” step in the process of healing ofhuman nature.55The Macarian Homilies from Collection I,9(forthcoming);Makarios/Simeon: Reden und Briefe.Die Sammlung I des Vaticanus Graecus694(B),1.24.53García Martínez and Tigchelaar (eds.),The Dead Sea Scrolls Study Edition,2.741.54Pseudo-Macarius,The Fifty Spiritual Homilies and the Great Letter,152.55It is noteworthy that Macarius again follows here the established tradition whichconnects the glory of Moses and the glory of Christ. The beginning of such a tradi-tion can be found in2Cor3:7–4:6. See: J.A. Fitzmyer, S.J., “Glory Reflected on theFace of Christ (2Cor3:7–4:6) and a Palestinian Jewish Motif,”JTS42(1981)630–644;A. Orlov and A. Golitzin, “Many Lamps are Lightened from the One: Paradigms ofthe Transformational Vision in the Macarian Homilies,”VC55(2001)281–298.TheSynoptic accounts of Christ’s transfiguration seem to be also influenced by the Mosestypology. Several details in the accounts serve as important reminders of Mosaic tra-dition(s): the vision took place on a mountain, the presence of Moses, a bright cloudthat enveloped the visionaries, a voice which came out of the cloud, and the shin-ing face of Christ. On Moses typology in the Synoptic accounts of the Transfigura-tion, see: J.A. McGuckin,The Transfiguration of Christ in Scripture and Tradition(Studies"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"342the moses traditionAn additional detail that connects Moses with Adam is that thehomilist understands Adam’s deprivation of the luminosity as thewound which requires healing.56In II.20.1and20.4–5, Macarius linksthe loss of the external luminous attire by Adam with the internalwound. The homilist tells that the human being who......is naked and lacks the divine and heavenly garment...is covered withthegreatshameofevilaffections... since ... the enemy, when Adamfell, used such cunning and diligence that he wounded and darkened theinterior man... man was, therefore, so wounded that no one else couldcure him...57Despite the extensive “usage” of the Moses typology in the Macariandiscussion of the Adamic “wound,” the whole purpose of this employ-ment remains Christological. Here again Macarius uses Mosaic tradi-tions as the mediative tool for his glory Christology.The Homily II.20recounts that Moses’ “healing” was incompletein comparison with the healing of Christ, since it was “external” andunable to heal the inner wound inflicted by Satan at the Fall. In II.32.4,Macarius sums up the Mosaic argument by telling us that:...Moses, having been clothed in the flesh, was unable to enter into theheart and take away the sordid garments of darkness.58Although Macarius tries to diminish the significance of Moses’ shin-ing face in the process of healing the human heart, he still seems todraw heavily on the Jewish traditions similar to4Q374, where Moses isdepicted as the healer of the darkened human nature.59in the Bible and Early Christianity,9; Lewiston, N.Y.: Edwin Mellen,1986),1–19;J. Markus,The Way of the Lord(Edinburgh: T&T Clark,1993),80–93; M.E. Thrall,“Elijah and Moses in Mark’s Account of the Transfiguration,”NTS16(1969–1970)305–317.56It should be noted that despite the fact that the motif of Adam’s luminous clothingis widespread in Aramaic and Syriac milieux, the conflation of this theme with theimagery of healing seem unique. See Brock, “Clothing Metaphors as a Means ofTheological Expression in Syriac Tradition,”11–40.57Pseudo-Macarius,The Fifty Spiritual Homilies and the Great Letter,151.58Pseudo-Macarius,The Fifty Spiritual Homilies and the Great Letter,198.59The Macarian Homilies, therefore, can be seen as the set of the intense polemicswith the Jewish developments."},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"vested with adam’sglory343ConclusionIt should be noted in conclusion that the examination of the Adam–Moses connection in the Macarian Homilies and in the Qumran frag-ments might be mutually beneficial for a better understanding of bothtextual corpora.First, the evidences to Adamic and Mosaic accounts found in theMacarian writings can extend the possible scope of the traditions whichwere preserved in the Dead Sea Scrolls materials in a very fragmentaryform. In the light of the Macarian evidence, which provided an addi-tional context for such traditions, it is not unreasonable to suggest thatthe passage from4Q374might speak about the healing power of Moses’glorious face as healing the “wound” of Adam in the weak humannature. Therefore, in4Q374,aswellasin4Q504, one might encountera very early tradition depicting Moses as the glorious counterpart ofAdam, the theme that later became a famous leitmotif in numerousJewish and Christian materials. Despite the fact that the Qumran pas-sage about the healing in4Q374lacks any reference to Adam or to hisglorious garments, its close affinities with the later Macarian evidence,where such connections are explicitly made, seem to clarify the propermeaning of the Qumran reference.Second, it is also evident that both4Q504and4Q374can providefurther insights for the background of the Adamic and Mosaic tradi-tions in the Macarian Homilies. Despite their fragmentary character,these Qumran evidences about Adam and Moses help one see thatthe Macarian employment of the Mosaic traditions has in fact a strongpolemical nature. The Syrian father seems to try to diminish the sig-nificance of Moses’ “glorification” in the process of “healing” humannature, depicting it as theexternalcovering unable to heal the innerwound caused by the Adamic transgression. However, the testimony tothe Mosaic tradition found in4Q374demonstrates that the emphasison the internal character of the healing was already made at Qumran,where Moses’ luminosity was depicted to be potent to heal the humanheart."},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"THE HEIRS OF THE ENOCHIC LORE:“MEN OF FAITH” IN2 ENOCH35:2 ANDSEFER HEKHALOT48D:101Make public the twenty-four booksthat you wrote first and let the worthyand the unworthy read them; butkeep the seventy that were writtenlast, in order to give them to the wiseamong your people.

It is significant that the designationof the ultimate receptors of the esoteric lore is identical in both tradi-tions. The Hekhalot reference may, therefore, have an Enochic prove-nance. Despite the fact that the reference to the chain of transmissionis repeated several times in the Hekhalot literature, the reference tothe Men of Faith and the Faithful in the chain is made only in the“Enochic” passage from3Enoch48D.15It is possible that the author ofthe passage combines the two traditions by adding to the mishnaic lineof transmission reflected inPirke AbotandAbot de Rabbi NathananewEnochic group, similar to those found in2Enoch35.Thetablebelowillustrates these combinations:2Enoch35:2m.

In such a perspective the Mosaic successors and Moseshimself represent only intermediate temporal guardians whose role isto pass the revealed knowledge into the hands of its true owners, theheirs of the Enochic tradition.16An important detail of3Enoch’saccount is its anti-Mosaic flavor: theauthors of the passage fromSefer Hekhalottry to diminish the impor-tance of Moses and the transmitters of the Mosaic Torah by depictingthe son of Amram in a role inferior to Enoch-Metatron from whomMoses receives his revelation. Scholars previously noted that this ten-dency to depict Metatron as a greater Moses was widespread in theMerkabah accounts. Several years ago David Halperin in his bookThe Faces of the Chariot17demonstrated the popularity of such compar-ative imagery, which reflects the polemical character of the Merkabahportrayals of Moses and Metatron. He noted that in these materialsMetatron is always depicted as “a greater Moses ... more exactly, he isMoses gone a step farther. Moses ascends to heaven; Metatron becomesruler of heaven. Moses defeats the angels; Metatron dominates them.Moses grasps God’s throne; Metatron sits on a throne identical to it.When Metatron grants revelation to Moses, he is giving a helping handto his junior alter ego... . These authors ... saw the exalted Metatronas the primary figure, the ascending Moses as his junior replica.”18Halperin’s work sees the initial background of the Merkabah polem-ical comparisons between the son of Amram and Metatron in Moses’ascension stories reflected in the rabbinic materials associated with theShabu#otcircle.19He suggested that “as historians of the tradition ... wemust reverse the relationships [between Moses and Metatron]. First theShabu#otpreachers had Moses invade heaven and lay hold of the throne.16In this respect2Enoch35operates with the concept of the “earthly guardians”(straæie zemnii) as the agents responsible for handling Enoch’s writings until theyfinally are brought into the hands of the “Men of Faith.” The expression “earthlyguardians” might reflect a polemic with the Mosaic notion of the transmission andpreservation of the revelation as “guarding.” Among other places, such a concept isreflected in the famous rabbinic saying fromm.Abot1:1where the preserving of thetradition is designated as “making the fence around the Torah.”17Halperin,The Faces of the Chariot.18Halperin,The Faces of the Chariot,426.19Halperin,The Faces of the Chariot,289ff."},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"350the moses traditionThen the authors of the Hekhalot, breaking the restraints of the olderstories, let Metatron enjoy the fruits of conquest.”20Still, despite Halperin’s suggestions about the formative value andprimacy of the rabbinicShabu#ottestimonies for Moses-Metatron polem-ical interactions, it is possible that already in the Second TempleEnochic materials, namely in2Enoch, the Enochic authors attemptedto portray the Mosaic hero as a junior replica of Enoch-Metatron.In my previously published articles, I argued that2Enochreveals anintricate web of the mediatorial debates in the course of which severaltraditions about exalted patriarchs and prophets prominent in the Sec-ond Temple Judaism, including Adam, Noah, and Moses, underwentpolemical appropriation when their exalted features were transferred tothe seventh antediluvian hero.21These polemical trends seem to reflectthe familiar atmosphere of the mediatorial interactions widespread inthe Second Temple period which offered contending accounts for theprimacy and supremacy of their exalted heroes. The polemics foundin2Enochare part of these debates and represent a response of theEnochic tradition to the challenges of its exalted rivals.In my previous work I tried to show that in2Enochmany theophanicfeatures of Moses’ story were transferred to Enoch.22Two o f s u chprominent characteristics are the motifs of the glorious face of theseventh antediluvian hero and his encounter with the Deity’s handduring his celestial metamorphosis. Our study must now proceed tothe investigation of these two motifs in2Enoch’smaterials.LuminousFaceofEnochFrom the Slavonic apocalypse one learns that the vision of the divineFace has dramatic consequences for Enoch’s appearance.

In2Enoch37onelearns about the unusual procedure performed on Enoch’s face at thefinal stage of his encounter with the Lord. The text informs us that theLord called one of his senior angels to chill the face of Enoch. The textsays that the angel was “terrifying and frightful,” and appeared frozen;he was as white as snow, and his hands were as cold as ice. With thesecold hands he then chilled the patriarch’s face. Right after this chillingprocedure, the Lord informs Enoch that if his face had not been chilledhere, no human being would have been able to look at him.23This ref-erence to the dangerous radiance of Enoch’s face after his encounterwith the Lord is an apparent parallel to the incandescent face of Mosesafter the Sinai experience in Exodus34.24Exodus34:29–35portrays Moses after his encounter with the Lord.The passage relates thatMoses came down from Mount Sinai ... Moses did not know that theskin of his face shone because he had been talking with God. WhenAaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, the skin of his face was shining,and they were afraid to come near him... and Moses would put the veilon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.This passage unambiguously constitutes the Mosaic background ofthe tradition found in2Enoch37, where Enoch’s face is depicted assimilar to Moses’ face who shields his luminous visage with a veil. Thetransference of the Mosaic motif into the framework of the Enochictradition is made here for the first time. It is also obvious that thistransferal has a polemical character. Passing on to the patriarch sucha salient detail of the biblical story would immediately invoke in theEnochic readers the memory of Moses’ example. Such transference alsointends to demonstrate that Moses’ encounter at Sinai and his luminousface represent later, inferior imitations of the primeval account of thepatriarch’s vision, a vision which occurred not on earth but in heavenin the antediluvian time.The polemical appropriation of the Mosaic motif of the seer’s radi-ant face is not confined in2Enochsolely to the encounter with the“frozen” angel, but is reflected also in other sections of the book.According to the Slavonic apocalypse, despite the chilling procedureperformed in heaven, Enoch’s face appears to have retained its trans-23Andersen, “2Enoch,”160.24Apoc.

In2Enoch64:2people ask the transformed Enoch for blessings so they canbe glorified in front of his face.25This theme of the transforming powerof the patriarch’s visage may also have a polemical flavor.The theme of the luminous countenance of the seer is also importantfor the ongoing discussion of the Enoch-Metatron connection. It shouldnot be forgotten that2Enoch’sappropriation of the Mosaic imageryserves as the formative framework for the later Enoch-Metatron ac-counts, and especially for the one reflected in the so-called additionalchapters26ofSefer Hekhalot. In these chapters the theme of the luminosityof Moses’ face and Metatron’s visage are also put in a polemical juxta-position. From3Enoch15B one learns that it is Enoch-Metatron, whoseface was once transformed into fire, who tells Moses about his shin-ing visage:27“At once Metatron, Prince of the Divine Presence, said toMoses, ‘Son of Amram, fear not! for already God favors you. Ask whatyou will with confidence and boldness, for light shines from the skinof your face from one end of the world to the other.’”28Here Moses isportrayed as a later version of his master Enoch-Metatron whose faceand body were transformed into blazing fire long before the prophet’sascension at Sinai.2925See2Enoch64:4(the longer recension): “And now bless your [sons], and all thepeople, so that we may be glorified in front of your face today.” Andersen, “2Enoch,”190.26For a critical assessment of the theory of “core” and “additions” inSefer Hekhalot,consult Peter Schäfer, “Handschriften zur Hekhalot-Literatur,” in: P.

See, for example,Synopse§§396–397: “...TheLord of all the worlds warned Moses that he should beware of his face. So it is written,‘Beware of his face’ .... This is the prince who is called Yofiel Yah-dariel ... he is calledMetatron.” On Metatron as the hypostatic Face of God see A.

The authors of2Enochmay have been care-fully following here the theological unfolding of the story of their rivaland the enhancement of his profile as an elevated figure. The familiar-ity of Enochic authors with the Second Temple extra-biblical Mosaicaccounts can be illustrated through an examination of the motif ofthe Deity’s hand; this hand embraces and protects the seer during hisencounter with the Lord in the upper realm.In2Enoch39the patriarch relates to his children that during hisvision of the divineKavod, the Lord helped him with his right hand. Thehand here is described as having a gigantic size and filling heaven: “Butyou, my children, see the right hand of one who helps you, a humanbeing created identical to yourself, but I have seen the right hand ofthe Lord,helping me(pomagawu mi)andfilling heaven(isplünýùunebo).”30The theme of the hand of God assisting the seer during hisvision of the Face recalls the Mosaic account from Exodus33:22–23.Here the Deity promises the prophet to protect him with his handduring the encounter with the divinePanim: “and while my glory passesby I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with myhand until I have passed by; then I will take away my hand, and youshall see my back; but my face shall not be seen.” There is also anotherearly Mosaic account where the motif of the divine hand assisting thevisionary is mentioned.

The passage from the Slavonic apocalypsealso mentions the right hand of the Lord. Further there is anotherterminological parallel that unifies the two accounts. While the longerrecension of2Enochuses the term “helping” (pomagawu) in referenceto the divine hand, some manuscripts of the shorter recension employthe word “beckoning” (pomavaþwi), the term used in theExagoge.The terminological affinities between theExagogeand2Enochpointto the possibility that the authors of the Slavonic apocalypse, in theirdevelopment of the theme of the divine hand, were relying not only onthe tradition preserved in Exodus but also on more advanced Mosaicspeculations similar to those found in Ezekiel the Tragedian.Although2Enoch’sdescription is very similar to theExagoge’s passage,the Slavonic apocalypse has a more advanced version of the mysticalimagery; this imagery demonstrates close parallels to the symbolism ofthe Merkabah lore. The important detail here is that the divine handis described as “filling heaven” (isplünýùu nebo).33This descriptionrecalls the language of theShi#ur Qomahaccounts, in which Metatronreveals to Rabbi Ishmael and Rabbi Akiba the knowledge of the gigan-tic limbs of the Deity, limbs which fill heaven. It has already beennoted that the allusion to this mystical imagery in the Slavonic apoca-lypse does not appear to be happenstance since it is incorporated thereinto a series of analogical comparisons between Enoch’s body and theLord’s body. These portrayals recall the later Hekhalot andShi#ur Qomahaccounts in which Enoch-Metatron is often portrayed as possessing thegigantic body himself.when these things are fulfilled.

Ishmael thatduring the transformation of his body into the gigantic cosmic extent,matching the world in length and breadth, God “laid his hand” onthe translated hero.35Here, just as in the Slavonic account, the handof the Deity signifies the bond between the seer’s body and the divinecorporeality.InSefer Hekhalotthe imagery of God’s hand is also conflated withthe Mosaic tradition. InSynopse§68Enoch-Metatron unveils to RabbiIshmael the hypostatic right hand of God with which “955heavenswere created.” This introduction of the divine hand is interwoven inSynopse§§68–6936into an elaborate set of references to Moses, to whom,according to the text, the mighty hand of God was once revealed.The author alludes to the passage from Isa63:12, in which the Deitysends his glorious arm to be at Moses’ right hand, as well as otherMosaic biblical themes. Although the name of the Israelite prophetis mentioned six times in this text, nothing is said about his exaltedprofile. It would seem appropriate there, since the main hero of thisaccount is not Moses but the translated patriarch, who now unveils themysteries of the divine hand to the visionary.Moreover it seems that, inSynopse§§77–80,37Enoch-Metatron isunderstood, at least implicitly, as the hypostatic hand of the Deityhimself. These materials depict the translated patriarch as the helpinghand of God; with this helping hand God passes the Torah to theMosaic hero and protects him against the hostility of angelic hosts.After this short excursus into the theophanic polemical appropria-tions let us now return to our passage about the Men of Faith found inSefer Hekhalot48where Enoch-Metatron is depicted as a revealer supe-rior to Moses.34Synopse§384.35“...the Holy One, blessed be he, laid his hand on me and blessed me with1,365,000blessings.

Itdepicts the Deity dictating to his celestial scribe, the patriarch Enoch,the account of creation organized in almost the same fashion as thefirst chapter of the biblical Genesis. The Lord starts his narration withthe familiar phrase “in the beginning”: “Before anything existed at all,from the very beginning (isprúva),38whatever exists I created from thenon-existent, and from the invisible.” Although the very first line of thenarration brings to memory the beginning of the Mosaic Torah, thecreational account itself is quite different from the one reflected in thebiblical Genesis. The story contains imagery pertaining to the primevalorder and to the creation of humanity that is completely missing fromthe biblical text. Although the Enochic scribes try to preserve the struc-tural grid of the Genesis story by organizing it around the seven daysof creation, the plot is greatly expanded with new striking details andunknown characters, among whom one can find, for example, the cos-mogonic figures designated as Adoil and Arukhas. The structure of thisnarration, involving the seven days of creation looks odd and dispropor-tional in comparison with its biblical counterpart.

Itis clearly fashioned as an alternative intended to overwrite an essentialpart of the Mosaic revelation. It is significant that despite the Enochicauthors’ attempt to deconstruct the well-known ancient account, thepurported antediluvian reception of their disclosure speaks for itself,silently postulating the primacy of this revelation over the one receivedseveral generations later by Moses on Mount Sinai. It is also importantthat unlike in1Enoch, in the Slavonic apocalypse God reveals to the seernot simply astronomical information or a warning about the upcomingjudgment, but a disclosure fashioned in form and structure similarly tothe Mosaic Torah. The mode of reception is also different since therevelation is received not simply as a seer’s dream, similar to the visionof the Biblical history in theAnimal Apocalypse, but as directly dictatedby God.The chapters following the creation account in2Enoch24–32arealso important for our discussion since they convey knowledge aboutthe function and the future role of this alternative version of the firstchapters of the Mosaic Torah. From2Enoch33:8–12one learns that therevelation recorded by Enoch will be transmitted from generation togeneration and it will not be destroyed until the final age. The twofollowing chapters (2Enoch34and35) also pertain to the themes ofGod’s revelation to Enoch and the destiny of his books. The themeof the Enochic books is conflated here with the notions of the yokeand the commandments: after informing the seer that his handwritingsand the handwritings of his ancestors will not perish in the upcomingflood, God reminds the seer about the wickedness of humans who haverejected the divine commandments and are not willing to carry theyoke (rmo)40which the Deity placed on them. It is curious that theterminology of “yoke” and “commandments” follows here the themeof Enochic writings. Scholars have previously proposed that the term“yoke” might be reserved here for the Torah. Celia Deutsch observesthat “the yoke here refers to Torah, as is indicated by its use with‘commandments.’”41She also notes that this theme is further expandedin2Enoch48:9, where it includes the teaching received by Enoch andtransmitted through the revealed books.42In2Enoch48:9the author of40Sokolov,Slavjanskaja Kniga Enoha Pravednogo,1.34.41C.

Already in the Second Temple materials,specifically in2(Slavonic) Enoch, Enochic authors sought to portray theMosaic hero as a junior replica of Enoch-Metatron and his revelationas the disclosure inferior to the one received by the seventh antedilu-vian patriarch. The passage fromSefer Hekhalot48D:10also attests tothis long-lasting rivalry between Moses and Enoch.

This association points to an apparent unitybehind the “Enoch-Noah’s axis.” In some Pseudepigrapha texts, “thewords of Noah” often follow closely “the words of Enoch.” From theearliest Enochic materials we can see this interdependence betweenNoachic and Enochic traditions.

In our further analysis we willexamine certain features of Noah’s story which come under attack inthese polemics.Noah’s SacrificesGen8:20pictures Noah’s animal sacrifice after his debarkation. Itmay be the first account of an animal sacrifice on the altar foundin the Bible. Although Abel’s animal offerings are mentioned in Gen4:4, these sacrifices did not establish any significant sacrificial patternfor future generations.11Until Noah, the Bible does not attest to anyongoing tradition of animal sacrifices. WhenJub. mentions the offeringsof Adam and Enoch, it refers to them as incense sacrifices.12Noah thus can be regarded as the originator of the official ongoingtradition of animal sacrifices. He is also the first person to have receivedfrom the Lord the commandment about the blood. As M. Stone ob-serves, Noah’s connection to the sacrificial cult and to instructionsconcerning the blood was not accidental.13In2Enoch, however, the role of Noah as a pioneer of animal sacrifi-cial practice is challenged by a different story. We learn in this text thatimmediately after Enoch’s instructions to his sons during his short visitto the earth and his ascension to the highest heaven, the firstborn sonof Enoch, Methuselah, and his brothers, the sons of Enoch, constructedan altar at Achuzan,14the place where Enoch had been taken up.15Inobserved in2Enoch71–72which rewrites the story of Noah’s birth, transferring thespecial traditions to Melkisedek.” M.

Verses11–16of thischapter describe the first animal sacrifice of Methuselah on the altar.The texts says that the people brought sheep, oxen, and birds (all ofwhich have been inspected) for Methuselah to sacrifice them before theface of the Lord.16Further, the text gives an elaborate description ofthe sacrificial ritual during which Methuselah slaughters with a knife,“in the required manner,” sheep and oxen placed at the head of thealtar.17All these sheep and oxen, of course, are tied according to thesectarian instructions given by Enoch earlier in the book. It is apparentthat Methuselah’s role in the animal sacrificial practice conflicts withthe canonical role of Noah as the originator of the animal sacrificialtradition.The text18poses a more formidable challenge to Noah’s uniqueplace in the sacrificial tradition by indicating that before his deathMethuselah passes his priestly/sacrificial duties to the younger brotherof Noah—the previously unknown Nir. Chapter70of2Enochrecountsthe last days of Methuselah on earth before his death. The Lord ap-peared to Methuselah in a night vision and commanded him to passhis priesthood duties on to the second son of Lamech, Methuselah’sgrandson Nir. The text does not explain why the Lord wanted to passthe priesthood to Nir instead of Noah (Lamech’s19firstborn son),20eventhough Noah is also mentioned in the dream. The text only tells aboutthe response of the people to that request: “Let it be so for us, and letthe word of the Lord be just as he said to you.” Further, the booktells that Methuselah invested Nir with the vestments of priesthood16F.

There is no substantialdifference between the recensions in the representation of these materials. During myanalysis I have used illustrations from both recensions in equal proportions.19Lamech died before Methuselah. According to the Masoretic text of Gen5:26–31, after Lamech was born, Methuselah lived782years... Lamech lived a total of777years.20This priestly succession from Methuselah to Nir is an apparent violation of all thenorms of traditional succession. Cf. the traditional view inJub.7:38–39:“Forthisishow Enoch, your father’s father, commanded his son Methuselah; then Methuselah hisson Lamech; and Lamech commanded me everything that his fathers had commandedhim.

ThenNir took the sacrificial knife and slaughtered them in the front ofthefaceoftheLord.23The important detail here is that immediatelyfollowing the sacrifice the text offers the formula in which the Lordis proclaimed to be the God of Nir. This title apparently stresses thepatriarchal authority of Nir: “and all people made merry in front of theface of the Lord, and on that day they glorified the Lord, the God ofheaven and earth, (the God) of Nir”2470:21–22.25Noah as an Originator of Sacrificial InstructionThe teaching about sacrifices comes from ancient times and is con-nected with Noah both inJub.21and in the Levi document (MountAthos) §57.26Jub.21:10refers to the sacrificial traditions written “in thewords of Enoch and in the words of Noah.”27The first part of this state-ment about Enoch as the originator of sacrificial instruction fully agreeswith2Enoch’s story. The text offers a lengthy account of Enoch’s sacri-ficial prescriptions to his sons during his short visit to the earth. Theseinstructions have a form of sacrificial halakhot. The halakhic charac-ter of these commands is reinforced by the specific Slavonic vocabularywhich employs the termzakonü(“law”) in reference to these sacrificialregulations. The text stresses that “he who puts to death any animalwithout binding it, it is an evil law,28he acts lawlessly29with his own21Andersen, “2Enoch,”197–203.22Andersen, “2Enoch,”202–203.23Andersen, “2Enoch,”202.24Slav.Gospoda Boga nebesi i zeml0 Nireva.M.I.Sokolov,“Materialyizametkipostarinnoj slavjanskoj literature.

The Slavonic wordzakonücommonlyused to denote a binding custom or a rule of conduct in the community,in some instances, carries a much more restricted, technical meaning: itsometimes refers to the Mosaic Law and serves as an alternate designa-tion for “halakha.”30Enoch’s sacrificial precepts occupy an important place in the narra-tive of2Enoch. Some of these sacrificial rules, however, have an appar-ent sectarian flavor. In chapter59,Enochoffers Methuselah, as well ashis brothers—Regim, Ariim, Akhazukhan, Kharimion—and the eldersof all the people, some instructions in animal sacrifices. These halakhotinclude the following guidelines:1. Enoch commands his sons to use clean beasts in their sacrifices.According to his prescriptions, “he who brings a sacrifice of cleanbeasts, it is healing, he heals his soul. And he who brings a sacrificeof clean birds, it is healing, he heals his soul.”312. Enoch teaches his sons that they should not touch an ox because ofthe “outflow.”323. Enoch’s prescriptions address the issue of the atoning sacrifices. Hesuggests that “a person bring one of the clean animals to make asacrifice on account of sin, so that he may have healing for his soul.”33Although the blood is not mentioned in these sacrificial prescriptionsof Enoch, the text uses extensively the term “an animal soul.” Enochcommands his sons to be cautious in dealing with animal souls, becausethose souls will accuse man in the day of judgment.344. Enoch also teaches his sons to bind sacrificial animals by four legs:30Cf. P.I. Avanesov, ed.,Slovar’ drevnerusskogo jazykaXI–XIV vv. (10vols.; Moscow:Russkij jazyk,1988–),3.317–319; R.M.

And everything which you have for food, bind it by four legs,35thereis healing, he heals his soul. He who puts to death any animal withoutbinding it, it is an evil custom; he acts lawlessly with his own soul.36S. Pines draws attention to this unique practice of tying together fourlegs during animal sacrifices. On the basis of a passage in the Mishna(m. Tamid4:1) which states that each of the forelegs of the sacrificialanimal was tied to the corresponding hind leg, Pines notes that thetying together of all four legs was contrary to the tradition.37Pinesgives one of the two explanations found in the Gemara of the Bablithat this disapproval sought to prevent the imitation of the customs ofthe heretics,minim38(the authors of Mishnaic sacrificial prescriptionsconsidered the practice of tying together all four legs to have strongsectarian overtones). In his final conclusion, Pines suggests that “it mayhave been an accepted rite of a sect, which repudiated the sacrificialcustoms prevailing in Jerusalem. It might be conjectured that this sectmight have been the Essenes, whose sacrificial usage differed accordingto the one reading of the passage of Josephus39from those practiced atthe Temple.”40As we can see,2Enochdepicts Enoch as the originator of the sac-rificial instruction. Although some of these instructions are not nec-essarily canonical, the role of Enoch in the sacrificial tradition fullyagrees withJub.21:10a. On the other hand,2Enochis completely silentabout Noah’s role in these sacrificial instructions. He is refered to nei-ther as the originator of these instructions nor as their practitioner.While the text speaks several times about the future role of Noah asa “procreator” of the postdiluvian race,41it is silent about his place in35Slav.sv¬æete e po ÷etyre nogi.

We might expect that Noah, then, willhave an opportunity to do his part after the Flood, but the text, leavesout any significant role for Noah in the postdiluvian priestly/sacrificialtradition. The duty of the priestly successor is given to Nir’s “son”—Melchizedek, who “will be the head of the priests”42in the postdilu-vian generation. Noah’s role is less prominent. According to theSlavonicEnoch, he “will be preserved in that generation for procreation.”43Noah and Divine RevelationsIn the Bible and the Pseudepigrapha, Noah is portrayed as a recipientof divine revelations, given to him both before and after the Flood. InGen6:13–21and Gen7:1–5, God speaks to Noah about the Deluge andthe construction of the ark. The evidence for the direct communicationbetween God and Noah is further supported by1Enoch67,Jub.5,andtheGenesis Apocryphon6–7. According to the Pseudepigrapha, Noah alsoenjoys various angelic revelations. In1Enoch10:1–3, an angel Asuryalwarns Noah about the upcoming destruction of the earth.Jub.10:1–14records an angelic revelation to Noah about evil spirits and healingherbs which he wrote in a book and gave to Shem, his oldest son.44Scholars also believe that in1Enoch60it is Noah who was described asa visionary.45These traditions depict Noah as the chosen vessel of divine revelationwho alone found favor in the sight of the Lord in the antediluvianturmoil.46These details and emphases on the direct communication betweenthe Lord and Noah are challenged by the information about Noahfound in2Enoch. As has been shown earlier, in theSlavonic EnochNoahkeeps a low profile. Although Noah is the firstborn of Lamech, he isportrayed as a family man, a helper to his prominent younger brother42Andersen,211.43Andersen,209.44J.C. VanderKam,The Book of Jubilees,2.60.45Kvanvig argues that “in1Enoch60,1–10.24c–25Noah is described as a visionary(as in4QMess Ar) and in a vision he is warned about the coming catastrophe. Thisdescription of the flood hero as a visionary had its parallel in both Atra-Hasis andBerossos’ version of the Flood story when the flood hero is warned in a dream.”Kvanvig,242.46Cf.

While Nir is a priest surrounded by crowds of people, Noah is atimid relative whose activities are confined to the circle of his family.After Melchizedek’s situation was settled, Noah quietly “went away tohis own place.”47In contrast to this modest role of Noah, Methuselah and Nir arepictured as priests of the Lord who have dreams/visions in which theLord gives them important instructions about priestly successions andfuture events. It sharply contrasts with the absence of any indication ofthe direct revelations of the Lord to Noah.48We therefore learn aboutthe Flood and Noah’s role in it from Methuselah49and Nir’s dreams.In2Enochchapter70the Lord appears to Methuselah in a nightvision. The Lord tells him that the earth will perish but Noah, the first-born son of his son Lamech, will be preserved in order that “anotherworld rise up from his seed.”50The account of the Lord’s revelation toMethuselah about the Flood and Noah in2Enoch70:4–10might belongto the “original” Noachic tradition. It shows some similarities to theaccount of Enoch’s revelation to Methuselah in1Enoch106:15–19.Theaffinities, however, should not be exaggerated.A symmetrical parallel to Methuselah’s dream in2Enoch70:4–10isNir’s night vision in71:27–30. In this short dream, which also describesin almost identical terms51the future destruction of the earth, oneimportant detail is missing. Noah is absent from this revelation,52and47Andersen,206–207.482Enoch73, which attests to such a revelation, is a later interpolation representedonly by the manuscriptRand partly (only one line) byRum. Cf. Sokolov, “SlavjanskajaKniga Enoha Pravednogo,”1.80and1.155. Our analysis of anti-Noachic polemicsstrengthens the hypothesis that2Enoch73is a later addition, foreign to the originalbody of the text. For the discussion about chapter73, see Vaillant, xxii; Andersen,212.49The motif of these divine/angelic revelations to Melthuselah parallels1Enoch106,1QapGen2:19and to the text of Pseudo-Eupolemus where “Methuselah ... learned allthings through the help of the angels of God, and thus we gained our knowledge.” CarlHolladay,Fragments from Hellenistic Jewish Authors(4vols,; Chico, Calif.: Scholars,1983),1.175.50Andersen, “2Enoch,”203.51For example, see in the manuscriptR:2Enoch70:8—“everything that stands willperish” (i pogybne vs0 stavlenie)and2Enoch71:27—“everything that stands on theearth will perish” (i pogybnetü vúsýko stavlenie zemno). Sokolov, “Slavjanskaja KnigaEnoha Pravednogo,”1.69and1.75.52It is clear that Noah’s name was purged from the original Noachic account whichlies behind Nir’s vision. The additional supporting detail here is that right after Nir’svision, when he arose from the sleep, he repeats the vision in his own words. In this"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"370the noah traditionhis place is now occupied by Melchizedek, who according to the Lordwill not perish during the Flood but will be the head of the priests inthe future.53This revision which substitutes one surviver of the Floodfor another fits perfectly in the pattern of anti-Noachic polemics of theSlavonic Enoch. The important role of Noah as the “bridge” between theantediluvian and postdiluvian worlds is openly challenged.Noah as a Bridge over the FloodM. Stone stresses that “the sudden clustering of works around Noahindicates that he was seen as a pivotal figure in the history of humanity,as both an end and a beginning.”54He also points out that the Pseude-pigrapha from Qumran, which ascribe the priestly teaching to Noah,stress Noah’s role as the “bridge” between the ante- and postdiluvianworlds.55In the Pseudepigrapha Noah carries the priestly tradition throughthe Flood.Jub. pictures Noah and his sons as priests. Targumic andrabbinic traditions also attest to the priestly functions of Noah’s family.The canonical emphasis on the role of Noah in the sacrificial practicehas been mentioned earlier.In2Enoch, however, this function of Noah as a vessel of the priestlytradition over the Flood56is seriously undermined by Melchizedek—the child predestined to survive the Flood in order to become thepriest to all priests in the postdiluvian generation. This story is repeatedrepetition Nir mentions both Melchizedek and Noah as survivors of the Flood. It isapparent that we have here two different traditions which sometimes do not reconcilewith each other. Cf. “And Melchizedek will be the head of the priests in anothergeneration. For I know indeed that this race will end in confusion and everyonewill perish, except that Noah, my brother, will be preserved in that generation forprocreation”71:33–37.

From2Enoch33:8–12we learn that theLord commanded his angels Arioch and Marioch to guard Enoch’s books, so “theymight not perish in the impending flood.” Andersen, “2Enoch,”157.

It is therefore no surprise to see that somedetails of Noah’s birth in2Enochare transferred to a new hero—thefuture postdiluvian priest, Melchizedek.The birth of Noah occupies an important place in the Noachictraditions. In1Enoch106–107and in theGenesis Apocryphon2–5,Noahis portrayed as a wonder-child.1Enochpictures him with a glorious faceand eyes like the rays of the sun. He was born fully developed; andas he was taken away from the hand of the midwife, he spoke to theLord. These extraordinary qualities of the wonder-child lead his fatherLamech to suspect that Noah’s birth was angelic in origin.57This story is supported by the lenghty priestly geneology which also includesEnoch, Methuselah, and Nir. Noah, of course, is not presented in this list: “Thereforehonor him (Melchizedek) together with your servants and great priests, with Sit, andEnos, and Rusi, and Amilam, and Prasidam, and Maleleil, and Serokh, and Arusan,and Aleem, and Enoch, and Methusalam, and me, your servant Nir.

Here again we have thepolemical rewriting of the Noachic narrative when the peculiar detailsof Noah’s story are transferred to an another character, namely, toMelchizedek.Scholars noted previously that Melchizedek’s birth inSlavonic Enochrecalls some parallels with the birth of Noah in1Enochand in theGenesisApocryphon.61The Melchizedek narrative occupies the last chapters of2Enoch. The content of the story is connected with the family of Nir.Sothonim, the wife of Nir, gave birth to a miraculous child “in her oldage,” right “on the day of her death.” She conceived the child, “beingsterile” and “without having slept with her husband.” The book tellsthat Nir the priest had not slept with her from the day that the Lordhad appointed him before the face of the people. Therefore, Sothonimhid herself during all the days of her pregnancy. On the day she wasto give birth, Nir remembered his wife and called her to himself inthe temple. She came to him, and he saw that she was pregnant. Nir,filled with shame, wanted to cast her from him, but she died at hisfeet. Melchizedek was born from Sothonim’s corpse. When Nir andNoah came in to bury Sothonim, they saw the child sitting beside thecorpse with “his clothing on him.” According to the story, they wereterrified because the child was fully developed physically. The childspoke with his lips and he blessed the Lord. The unusual child wasmarked by the sign of priesthood. The story describes how “the badgeof priesthood” was on his chest, glorious in appearance. Nir and Noahdressed the child in the garments of priesthood and fed him the holybread. They decided to hide him, fearing that the people would havehim put to death. Finally, the Lord commanded His archangel Gabrielto take the child and place him in “the paradise Eden,” so that hemight become the high priest after the Flood. The final passages of61Cf. M.

Both Noah and Melchizedek belonged to the circle of Enoch’s family.2. Both characters are attested as “survivors” of the Flood.3. Both characters have an important mission in the postdiluvian era.4. Both characters are pictured as glorious wonder children.5. Immediately after their birth, both characters spoke to the Lord.1Enoch106:3—“And when he (Noah) arose from the hands of the mid-wife, he opened his mouth and spoke to the Lord with righteous-ness.”2Enoch71:19—“he (Melchizedek) spoke with his lips, and heblessed the Lord.”626.

Their fathers were suspicious of the conception of their sons and thefaithfulness of their wives.64In theGenesis Apocryphon, Lamech is worried and “frightened” aboutthe birth of Noah, his son.

And he said to her, ‘what isthis that you have done, O wife? And why have you disgraced me inthe front of the face of all people? And now, depart from me, go whereyou conceived the disgrace of your womb.’”668. Their mothers were ashamed and tried to defend themselves againstthe accusation of their husbands.In theGenesis Apocryphon, the wife of Lamech responds to the angryquestions of her husband by reminding him of their intimacies: “Ohmy brother and lord! remember my sexual pleasure... [...] in the heatof intercourse, and the gasping of my breath in my breast.”67Sheswears that the seed was indeed of Lamech: “I swear to you by theGreat Holy One, by the King of the hea[vens...]...[...] that this seedcomes from you, [...] and not from any foreigner nor from any of thewatchers or sons of heav[en].”68In2EnochSothonim does not explainthe circumstances of the conception. She answers Nir: “O my lord!Behold, it is the time of my old age, and there was not in me any (ardorof) youth and I do not know how the indecency of my womb has beenconceived.”699. Their fathers were eventually comforted by the special revelationabout the prominent future role of their sons in the postdiluvian era.It is noteworthy that this information is given in both cases in thecontext of the revelation about the destruction of the earth by theFlood.1Enoch106:16–18—“And this son who has been born unto you shallbe left upon the earth, and his three sons shall be saved when they whoare upon the earth are dead.”65F.

The text therefore can be seen as a set ofimprovisations on the original Noachic themes.Noah’s SonShem b. Noah plays a prominent role in Noachic traditions.71Accord-ing toJubilees, Shem is Noah’s choice in the transmission of his teach-ing. FromJub.10:13–14we learn that “Noah wrote down in a bookeverything ... and he gave all the books that he had written to his old-est son Shem because he loved him much more than all his sons.”72Because of his unique role in the Noachic tradition, Shem b. Noah isalso one of the targets of the anti-Noachic polemics of2Enoch.Thisdebate takes its place in the last chapters of the book which are con-nected with the Melchizedek legend.The previous exposition shows that the Melchizedek story is closelyconnected with Nir’s family. Even though Nir is not the biologicalfather of Melchizedek, he later adopts him as his son. In2Enochchap-ter71Nir says to the Lord: “For I have no descendants, so let this childtake the place of my descendants and become as my own son, andyou will count him in the number of your servants.”73In this instanceof Nir’s “adoption” of Melchizedek we have again an anti-Noachicmotif.In targumic and rabbinic literature Melchizedek is often attested asthe oldest son of Noah—Shem. The identification of Melchizedek andShem can be found inTg. Ps.-J.,Frg. Tg.,Tg. Neof.,Gen. Rab.43.1;44.7,Abot R. Nat.2,Pirke R. El.7;27,andb.

Noah (Melchizedek) represents an impor-tant link in the passing of the Noachic priestly/sacrificial traditionto Abraham. This prominent motif of the succession of the Noachicpriestly/sacrificial tradition by the tradition of Abraham and his de-scendants, including Isaac and Levi, can be found already inJub.21and in the Levi document from Athos.In contrast, the text of theSlavonic Enochattempts to build an alter-native to the traditional targumic/rabbinic line of interpretation, whichserves as a parallel to the official Noah-Shem line. Previously unknownNir, the young brother of Noah, plays an important theological rolein this shift. The substitution of Noah’s “fatherhood” to Nir’s “father-hood” is one more facet of the complicated anti-Noachic polemics inthe text of2Enoch.ConclusionThe goal of our research was to show the existence of anti-Noachicpolemics in2Enoch. To understand the reasons for the suppressionof the Noahic traditions in the text would require another lengthyinvestigation. However, some conclusions can be made at this stage ofthe research.74Cf. for exampleb.Ned.32b:“R.ZechariahsaidonR.Ishmael’sauthority:TheHoly One, blessed be He, intended to bring forth the priesthood from Shem, as itis written, ‘And he [Melchizedek] was the priest of the most high God’ (Gen14:18).But because he gave precedence in his blessing to Abraham over God, He broughtit forth from Abraham; as it is written, ‘And he blessed him and said, Blessed beAbram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth, and blessed be themost high God’ (Gen14:19). Said Abraham to him, ‘Is the blessing of a servant tobe given precedence over that of his master?’ Straightway it [the priesthood] was givento Abraham, as it is written (Ps.110:1), ‘The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou atmy right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool;’ which is followed by, ‘TheLord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever, after the order ofMelchizedek’ (Ps.110:4), meaning, ‘because of the word of Melchizedek.’ Hence it iswritten, And he was a priest of the most High God, [implying that] he was a priest,but not his seed.”The Babylonian Talmud.

The foregoing survey testifies to the existence of anti-Noachic polem-ics in2Enoch. The analysis shows that these polemics seem to be basedon the “original” Noachic materials which demonstrate some distantparallels with the fragments of theBook of Noahfound in1Enoch,Jub.,and theGenesis Apocryphon.752. The anti-Noachic debates involve a substantial rewriting of the “orig-inal” Noachic motifs and themes. The details of the Noah “biography”are rearranged and transferred to other characters, including Methuse-lah, Nir, and Melchizedek.3. It appears that the main target of the anti-Noachic polemics isthe Noah–Abraham priestly connection. It explains why Melchizedek(who in targumic/rabbinic traditions represents the important link inthe passing of the Noachic priestly/sacrificial tradition to Abraham)becomes the center of the fierce anti-Noachic debates in2Enoch.Thefact that Abraham and his progeny are completely absent in2Enochfurther supports the hypothesis. In this Slavonic apocalypse the Lord isnamed as “God of your father Enoch”76—the familiar title which in theBible is connected with Abraham and his descendants.4. The anti-Noachic polemics could be also triggered by the promi-nence of the Adamic tradition in theSlavonic Enoch,77where “the highpriesthood is traced back ultimately to Adam.”78In the Pseudepigraphaand the Qumran writings, the Adamic and Priestly—Noah traditionsoften compete with and suppress each other. In the Adamic tradition,the source of evil is traced to the fall of Adam and Eve in Eden. In con-trast to that, the Noachic tradition bases its understanding of the origin75It is possible that some traces of the polemics with Noachic tradition can be foundalready in early Enochic documents, including bookletes of1Enoch,whereEnochoften“substitutes” Noah in Noachic narratives. Such tensions between Enoch and Noahcan be rooted in certain Mesopotamian “prototypes” common for both characters.Cf. P. Grelot, “La légende d’Hénoch dans les apocryphes et dans la Bible: origine etsignification,”RSR46(1958)189–191.76Cf.2Enoch69:2,69:5,and70:3—“I am the Lord, the God of your father Enoch”(Bogú otca tvoego Enoha).77On the Adamic traditions in the Slavonic pseudepigrapha and2Enochsee: ÉmileTu r d e a n u ,Apocryphes slaves et roumains de L’Ancien Testament(SVTP,5; Leiden: Brill,1981),405–435; C.

In this section of the pseudepigraphon we learn that, immediately after Enoch’sinstructions to his sons during his short visit to the earth and his ascension to thehighest heaven, the firstborn son of Enoch, Methuselah, and his brothers, the sonsof Enoch, constructed an altar at Achuzan, the place where Enoch had been takenup. In2Enoch69the Lord appeared to Methuselah in a night vision and appointedhim as priest before the people. Verses11–16of this chapter describe the first animalsacrifice of Methuselah on the altar. The text gives an elaborate description of thesacrificial ritual during which Methuselah slaughters with a knife, “in the requiredmanner,” sheep and oxen placed at the head of the altar. All these sheep and oxenare tied according to the sectarian instructions given by Enoch earlier in the book.Chapter70of2Enochrecounts the last days of Methuselah on earth before his death.The Lord appeared to Methuselah in a night vision and commanded him to pass hispriesthood duties on to the second son of Lamech, the previously unknown Nir. Thetext does not explain why the Lord wanted to pass the priesthood to Nir instead ofNoah (Lamech’s firstborn son), even though Noah is also mentioned in the dream.Further, the book tells that Methuselah invested Nir with the vestments of priesthoodbefore the face of all the people and “made him stand at the head of the altar.”The account of the sacerdotal practices of Enoch’s relatives then continues with theMelchizedek story. The content of the story is connected with Nir’s family. Sothonim,Nir’s wife, gave birth to a child “in her old age,” right “on the day of her death.”She conceived the child, “being sterile” and “without having slept with her husband.”The book narrated that Nir the priest had not slept with her from the day that theLord had appointed him in front of the face of the people.

These polemical tenden-cies seem to reflect the familiar atmosphere of the mediatorial debateswidespread in the Second Temple period which offered contendingaccounts for the primacy and supremacy of their exalted heroes. Thepolemics found in2Enochis part of these debates and represent aresponse of the Enochic tradition to the challenges of its rivals.4A.

The legacy of thispriestly-sacrificial office is still strictly maintained within the Enochicfamily since Noah’s priestly garments are not lost or destroyed butinstead are skillfully transferred to other kinsmen of the Enochic clan,including its traditional member Methuselah7and two other, newly-acquired relatives, Nir8and Melchizedek.9This shows that the impetus for the denigration of Noah, this impor-tant character of the Enochic-Noachic axis, does not come from oppo-nents to the Enochic tradition, but rather originates within this lore.

She found that such dualistic ideas were consistent with thesectarian teaching that “God had two sons, Satanail and Michael.”23Maunder’s study was not limited solely to the analysis of the theologicalfeatures of the text but also included a summary of the astronomicaland calendarical observations which attempted to prove a late date forthe text. Her argument against the early dating of the pseudepigraphonwas later supported by J.K. Fotheringham, who offered a less radicalhypothesis that the date of2Enochmust be no earlier than the middleof the seventh century CE.24Scholars have noted that Maunder’s argumentation tends to under-estimate the theological and literary complexities of the SlavonicEnoch.

Another attempt to question the scholarly consensus about the earlydate of2Enochwas made by Jósef Milik in his introduction to theedition of the Qumran fragments of the Enochic books published in1976.27In the introductory section devoted to the Slavonic Enoch,Milik proposed that the apocalypse was composed between the ninthand tenth centuries CE by a Byzantine Christian monk who knew theEnochic Pentateuch “in the form with which we are familiar throughthe Ethiopic version.”28In order to support his hypothesis of a late dateMilik draws attention to several lexical features of the text. One of themis the Slavonic wordzmureniemü(zmureniem’)29found in2Enoch22:11which Milik has traced to the Greek termσυρμαι%γρα#\u0011ς,30a derivativeof the verbσυρμαι\u0011γρα#ε.ν, translated as “to write in minuscule, hencequickly.”31He argues that this verb appears to be a neologism which isnot attested in any Greek text before the beginning of the ninth century.In addition in his analysis of the lexical features of the apocalypse,Milik directed attention to the angelic names of Arioch and Mariochfound in2Enoch33, arguing that they represent the equivalents of the25A.

He also argued that the priestly succession fromMethuselah to Noah’s nephew Melchizedek described in the third partof2Enochreflects “the transmission of monastic vocations from uncleto nephew, the very widespread custom in the Greek Church duringthe Byzantine and medieval periods.”35This feature in his opinion alsopoints to the late Byzantine date of the pseudepigraphon.

It alsoshows that none of these hypotheses has been able to stand up to criti-cism and to form a rationale that would constitute a viable counterpartto the scholarly opinion supporting the early date. Still, one should rec-ognize that, while the adoption of an early date for the text itself doesnot face great challenges, placing the text within the precise boundariesof Second Temple Judaism is a much more difficult task.In proceeding to this task one must first understand what featuresof the text point to the early date of the text in the chronologicalframework of Second Temple Judaism. It is noteworthy that the vastmajority of scholarly efforts have been in this respect directed towardsfinding possible hints that might somehow indicate that the Temple wasstill standing when the original text was composed.38Thus, scholarshave previously noted that the text does not seem to hint that thecatastrophe of the destruction of the Temple has already occurred atthe time of its composition. Critical readers of the pseudepigraphonwould have some difficulties finding any explicit expression of feelingsof sadness or mourning about the loss of the sanctuary.The affirmations of the value of the animal sacrificial practices andEnoch’s halakhic instructions also appear to be fashioned not in the“preservationist,” mishnaic-like mode of expression, but rather as ifthey reflected sacrificial practices that still existed when the author waswriting his book.39There is also an intensive and consistent effort onthe part of the author to legitimize the central place of worship, whichthrough the reference to the placeAchuzan(a cryptic name for the tem-ple mountain in Jerusalem), is transparently connected in2Enochwiththe Jerusalem Temple.40Scholars have also previously noted that thereare some indications in the text of the ongoing practice of pilgrimageto the central place of worship; these indications could be expectedin a text written in the Alexandrian Diaspora.41Thus, in his instruc-tions to the children, Enoch repeatedly encourages them to bring thegifts before the face of God for the remission of sins, a practice which38U.

These discussions are not new; even Charlesemployed the references to the Temple practices found in the Slavonicapocalypse as main proofs for his hypothesis of the early date of theapocalypse. Since Charles’ pioneering research these arguments havebeen routinely reiterated by scholars.Recently, however, Christfried Böttrich attempted to broaden thefamiliar range of argumentation by bringing to scholarly attention adescription of the joyful celebration which in his opinion may fix thedate of the apocalypse within the boundaries of the Second Templeperiod. In his introduction to his German translation of2Enochpub-lished in1995, Böttrich draws attention to a tradition found in Chap-ter69of the Slavonic apocalypse which deals with the joyful festivalmarking Methuselah’s priestly appointment and his animal sacrifices.44According to Böttrich’s calculations, this cult-establishing event falls onthe17th of Tammuz, which in his opinion is identified in2Enochasthe day of the summer solstice.45Böttrich links this solar event with theimagery found in2Enoch69, where Methuselah’s face becomes radi-ant in front of the altar “like the sun at midday rising up.” He thenreminds us that, since the second century CE, the17th of Tammuz wasobserved as a day of mourning and fasting because it was regarded asthe day when Titus conquered Jerusalem.46Böttrich suggests that thedescription of the joyful festival in2Enoch69, which does not show anysigns of sadness or mourning, indicates that the account and conse-quently the whole book were written before the fall of Jerusalem andthe destruction of the Temple in70CE.47422Enoch61:1–5;2Enoch62:1–2.432Enoch51:4: “In the morning of the day and in the middle of the day and in theevening of the day it is good to go to the Lord’s temple on account of the glory of yourcreator.” Andersen, “2Enoch,”178.44Böttrich,Das slavische Henochbuch,813.

Böttrich is unawareof the Noachic polemics witnessed to by the Slavonic apocalypse anddoes not notice that the description of Methuselah as the originator ofthe animal sacrificial cult in2Enoch69represents the polemical coun-terpart to Noah’s role, who is portrayed in the Bible and the pseude-pigrapha as the pioneer of animal sacrificial practice.48Methuselah,who has never been previously attested in Second Temple materialsas the originator of sacrificial cult, thus openly supplants Noah, whoseprominent role and elevated status the authors of the Slavonic apoc-alypse want to diminish. It has already been mentioned that in thecourse of the Noachic polemics, many exalted features of the hero ofthe Flood have been transferred to other characters of the book.

Still, Böttrich is unable to dis-cern the Noachic meaning of this allusion. Meanwhile Fletcher-Louisclearly sees this Noachic link, demonstrating that Methuselah’s radi-ant face in2Enoch69is linked not only to Sirach50:5–11but alsoto1Enoch106:255and1Q19.56Sirach’s description of the high priestSimon serves here as an intermediate link that elucidates the connec-tion between Noah and Methuselah. All three characters are sharingthe identical priestly imagery. Fletcher-Louis notes strong parallelismbetween Simon’s description and the priestly features of the story ofNoah. He observes thatthis description of Simon the high priest comes at the climax of a lengthyhymn in praise of Israel’s heroes which had begun some six chaptersearlier with (Enoch and) Noah (44:16–17), characters whose identity andpurpose in salvation-history the high priest gathers up in his cultic office.Obviously, at the literal level Noah’s birth in1Enoch106:2takes place intheprivatehouse of his parents. However, I suggest the reader is meantto hear a deeper symbolic reference in that house tothehouse (cf. Sirach50:1), the Temple, which Simon the high priest illuminates and glorifies.Just as Simon appears from behind the veil which marks the transitionfrom heaven to earth and brings a numinous radiance to the realm of53Crispin Fletcher-Louis notes parallels between this scene and the descriptionof the ideal high priest from Sirach50. He argues that “in Sirach50the liturgicalprocession through Simon’s various ministrations climaxes with Aaron’s blessings of thepeople (50:20,cf.Numbers6) and a call for all the readers of Sirach’s work ‘to bless theGod of all who everywhere works greater wonders, who fosters our growth from birthand deals with us according to his mercy’ (50:22).

Nevertheless,he fails to discern the proper meaning of such a connection, unable torecognize the Noachic background of the imagery. It is not coincidentalthat in the Noachic accounts the facial features of the hero of the Floodare linked to solar imagery. Fletcher-Louis notes the prominence ofthe solar symbolism in the description of Noah’s countenance; his eyesare compared with “the rays of the sun.” He suggests that “the solarimagery might ultimately derive from the Mesopotamian primeval his-tory where the antediluvian hero is closely identified with the sun.”58Yet in the Second Temple period such solar imagery has taken on dis-tinctively priestly associations.59In light of the aforementioned traditions, it is clear that Methuselah,who in2Enoch69inherits Noah’s priestly office is also assuming therethe features of his appearance as a high priest, one of which is theradiant visage associated with solar symbolism. The radiant face ofMethuselah in2Enoch69thus represents a significant element of thepolemics against the priestly Noachic tradition and its main character,whose facial features were often compared to the radiance of the sun.Noachic Polemics and the Date of the TextThe analysis of the Noachic background of the priestly and sacrificialpractices in2Enochleads us to the important question about the roleof Noachic polemical developments in discerning the early date of theapocalypse. It is possible that the Noachic priestly polemics reflectedin2Enochrepresent the most important and reliable testimony that thetext was composed when the Second Temple was still standing.The central evidence here is the priestly features of the miraculousbirth of the hero. It has been already demonstrated that the main con-cern of the story of the wondrous birth was sacerdotal; the story ispermeated with imagery portraying the newborn as the high priestparexcellence. It also has been shown that the anti-Noachic priestly tradition57Fletcher-Louis,All the Glory of Adam,47.58Fletcher-Louis,All the Glory of Adam,46.59Fletcher-Louis,All the Glory of Adam,46."},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"394the noah traditionreflected in2Enochis not separate from the Enochic-Noachic axis butbelongs to the same set of conceptual developments reflected in suchSecond Temple Enochic and Noachic materials as1Enoch106,theGen-esis Apocryphon,and1Q19.60The traditions prevalent in these accountswere reworked by the Enochic author(s) of the Slavonic apocalypsein response to the new challenging circumstances of the mediatorialpolemics. The priestly features of2Enoch’saccount of the wondrousbirth might thus point to the fact that this narrative and, as a conse-quence, the whole macroform to which it belongs was written in theSecond Temple period. It should be emphasized again that the distinctchronological marker here is not the story of the wonder child itself,which was often imitated in later Jewish materials, but the priestly fea-tures of the story that are missing in these later improvisations.The analysis of the later pseudepigraphic and rabbinic imitationsof the account of Noah’s birth shows that the priestly dimension ofthe story never transcended the boundaries of the Enochic-Noachiclore, nor did it cross the chronological boundary of70CE since itremained relevant only within the sacerdotal context of the SecondTemple Enochic-Noachic materials. Although some later Jewish au-thors were familiar with the account of Noah’s birth, this story neveragain became the subject of priestly polemics once the dust of thedestroyed Temple settled.Several examples can illustrate this situation. In search of the latervariants of the story of the wonder-child Fletcher-Louis draws attentionto the account of Cain’s birth in the primary Adam books.61Thus, theLatinLife of Adam and Eve21:3relates that Eve “brought forth a sonwho shone brilliantly (lucidus). At once the infant stood up and ranout and brought some grass with his own hands and gave it to hismother. His name was called Cain.”62Fletcher-Louis points out that60Fletcher-Louis suggests that the authors ofJubileesprobably also knew the story ofNoah’s birth, since the text mentions his mother Bitenosh.

Although the authors of the LatinLAEmight have been familiar with the narrative of Noah’s birth, thepriestly concerns associated with the story were no longer relevant forthem.The same situation of the absence of the sacerdotal concern is ob-servable also in the rabbinic stories of Moses’ birth reflected inb.Sotah12a,64Exod.

Fletcher-Louis observes that, although Moses, likeNoah, is able to speak from his birth and the house of his birth becomesflooded with light, “the differences of the specifically priestly form ofthat older tradition can be clearly seen.”69He points out that whileMoses is able to speak as soon as he is born, he does not bless God, asdo Noah and Melchizedek.70The same paradigm shift is detected in thelight symbolism. While in the rabbinic stories the whole house becomesflooded with light, the Mosaic birth texts do not specifically say thatMoses is himself the source of light.71These differences indicate that,unlike in2Enoch, where the priestly concerns of the editors come tothe fore, in the rabbinic accounts they have completely evaporated.72Fletcher-Louis notices that “the fact that in the Mosaic stories the childis circumcised at birth indicates his role as an idealized representativeof every Israelite: where Noah bears the marks of the priesthood,Moses carries the principal identity marker of every member of Israel,irrespective of any distinction between laity and priesthood.”73The marked absence of sacerdotal concerns in the later imitations ofthe story may explain why, although the rabbinic authors knew of thepriestly affiliations of the hero of the Flood, the story of his priestly birthnever appeared in the debates about the priestly successions. This factconvincingly demonstrates that the Noachic priestly tradition reflectedin2Enochcan be firmly placed inside the chronological boundaries ofthe Second Temple period, which allows us to safely assume a date ofthe Melchizedek story and the entire apocalypse before70CE.69Fletcher-Louis,All the Glory of Adam,52.70Fletcher-Louis,All the Glory of Adam,52.71Fletcher-Louis reminds that “the illumination of the house through Noah’s eyesand the comparison of the light to that of the sun are specifically priestly features ofNoah’s birth.” Fletcher-Louis,All the Glory of Adam,52–53.72Although the priestly affiliation of the hero of the Flood was well known to therabbinic authors, as the story of Shem-Melchizedek has already demonstrated.73Fletcher-Louis,All the Glory of Adam,53."},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"THE JACOB TRADITION"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"THE FACE AS THE HEAVENLYCOUNTERPART OF THE VISIONARY INTHE SLAVONICLADDER OF JACOBIntroductionThe book of Genesis portrays Jacob as someone who not only sawGod but also wrestled with Him. Jacob’s visionary experiences beginin Genesis28where he sees in a dream the ladder on which the angelsof God are ascending and descending. Above the ladder Jacob beholdsthe Lord. The distinct feature of the Bethel account is the paucity oftheophanic imagery. Despite the fact that the vision is linked with thecelestial realm (“ladder’s top reaching to heaven”), which is labeled inthe story as “the awesome place,” “the house of God,” and “the gate ofheaven,” the narrative does not offer any descriptions of God’s celestialcourt or his appearance. Instead we have the audible revelation of God,his lengthy address to Jacob with promises and blessings.God appears again to Jacob in Genesis32. While the narrativestresses the importance of the vision of God (the account claims thatJacob “saw God face to face” and even called the place of wrestlingPeniel/Penuel—“The Face of God”), it focuses its description on Ja-cob’swrestlingwith God rather than hisseeingof God.The reference to the motif of God’s Face (which plays an importantrole in a number of biblical theophanic accounts)1and to Jacob’s seeingof God “face to face” could however indicate that the authors or editorsof Jacob’s account might be cognizant of the broader anthropomorphictheophanic debates in which the motif of God’s Face2played an impor-1See, e.g., Exod.33:18–23;Ps.17:15.2OntheFaceofGod,seeS.Balentine,The Hidden God: The Hiding Face of God in theOld Testament(Oxford: Oxford University Press,1983),49–65; A.

Despite its long life inside the com-pendium of heterogeneous materials and its long history of transmis-sion in Greek and Slavonic milieux, the pseudepigraphon seems tohave preserved several early traditions that can safely be placed withinthe Jewish environment of the first century CE. Scholars propose thatthe SlavonicLadder of Jacobis most likely derived from its Greek vari-ant, which in turn appears to have been translated from Hebrew orAramaic.6The content of the work is connected with Jacob’s dreamabout the ladder and the interpretation of the vision. In Horace Lunt’stranslation, the text is divided into seven chapters.7The first chap-ter depicts Jacob’s dream in which he sees the ladder and receivesGod’s audible revelation about the promised land and blessings uponhis descendants. In the second chapter, a reader encounters Jacob’slengthy prayer to God in which he uncovers additional details of hisdream and asks God to help him interpret the dream. In chapter3,God sends to Jacob the angel Sariel as an interpreter. In chapter4,Sariel informs Jacob that his name has been changed to Israel. Percep-tive readers may thus notice that despite the title of pseudepigraphon,its text is not only confined to the ladder account but also accom-modates features of Jacob’s other visions, namely, the substitution ofhis name during the wrestling account. The last three chapters of theLadderrecount Sariel’s eschatological interpretations of Jacob’s dreamin which he reveals to the visionary the details of future human his-tory.Slovar’ knizhnikov i knizhnosti Drevnei Rusi,285–288; V.M.

The text describes Jacob’s dream in which hesees a twelve step ladder, fixed on the earth, whose top reaches toheaven with the angels ascending and descending on it. This familiarbiblical motif then is elaborated further and adds some new features.8The story relates that on the ladder Jacob sees twenty-two human faceswith their chests, two of them on each step of the ladder. On the topof the ladder, he also beholds another human face “carved out of fire”9with its shoulders and arms. In comparison with the previous “faces,”this fiery “higher” face looks “exceedingly terrifying.” The text portraysGod standing above this “highest” face and calling Jacob by his name.The depiction leaves the impression that God’s voice10is hidden behindthis fiery terrifying “face” as a distinct divine manifestation, behindwhich God conveys to Jacob his audible revelation about the PromisedLand and the blessings upon Jacob’s descendants.This description of the celestial “Face” as the fiery anthropomor-phic extent,11which serves as the embodiment of the deity leads usto another Slavonic text in which the theme of the fiery Face loomslarge.

And the face in the middle was higher than all thatI saw, the one of fire, including the shoulders and arms, exceedingly terrifying, morethan those twenty-four faces. And while I was still looking at it, behold, angels of Godascended and descended on it.

The important detail that connectsthis passage withLadderis that the Face in2Enochis similarly definedas “fiery”13and “terrifying.”14Another parallel is that in both2EnochandLadderthe Face is understood as the luminous representation of thedeity, behind which He can convey His audible revelation to visionar-ies.15It is noteworthy that the incandescent Face in2Enoch, as well as inLadder, is depicted not as a part of an angelic or divine “body” butrather as the fiery “forefront” of the whole anthropomorphic extent.16It has been previously noted17that this fiery extent, labeled in somebiblical and intertestamental texts as the “Face,” is related to the glori-ous celestial entity known in theophanic traditions as God’sKavod.18Inthese traditions, the Face often serves to designate the radiantfaçadeofthe divineKavod.19This tendency to equate the Face with theKavodcanto be talked about, it is so very marvelous and supremely awesome and supremelyfrightening. And who am I to give an account of the incomprehensible being ofthe Lord, and of his face, so extremely strange and indescribable? And how manyare his commands, and his multiple voice, and the Lord’s throne, supremely greatand not made by hands, and the choir stalls all around him, the cherubim andthe seraphim armies, and their never-silent singing.

Andersen in his commentary on2En.22notes the similarities between the fieryface in2Enochand the face of fire inLadder.Cf.Andersen,“2Enoch,”137,n.22d.14Both Slavonic pseudepigraphons in their description of the Face share the sim-ilar Slavonic terminology, words like face (lice); fiery (ognena,iz[ ogn0); terrifying(straqno).

Jacob’s prayer revealsthat his dream about the Face might represent the vision of the Throneof God’s Glory. A number of points need to be noted to support thisconclusion:a. The prayer refers to “his many-eyed ones,”22alluding to\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\f\u000e\u0006,the Wheels, the special class of the Angels of the Throne who aredescribed in Ezek.1:18as the angelic beings “full of eyes.”as the fierybust: “I saw that from what appeared to be hiswaist uphe looked likeglowing metal, as it full of fire, and that from there down he looked like fire; andbrilliant light surrounded him.”20See Exod.33:18–23: “Then Moses said, ‘Now show me your glory (\u0010\u000b\u0016\u0015).’ Andthe Lord said, ‘I will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you, and I will proclaimmy name, the Lord, in your presence... but,’ he said, ‘you cannot see my face (\u0003\u0004\u0005), fornoonemayseemeandlive.’”21Lunt, “Ladder of Jacob,”408.22Andersen, “2Enoch,”137."},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"the face as the heavenly counterpart of the visionary 405b.

Finally, the passage explicitly identifies the fiery Face with God’sglory.Ladder of Jacob2:15says that “before the face of your glorythe six-winged seraphim are afraid... .” Thus the fiery face inLadder1:6is not just any face but the Face of God.The apparent similarities between two Slavonic accounts indicate thatLadder, as well as2Enoch, seem to represent a single tradition in whichthe fiery Face is associated withKavod.Additional evidence to support the view that the fiery Face on theladder inLadderrepresents God’sKavodcan be found in the targumicaccounts of Jacob’s story.Targum Pseudo-JonathanandTargum Onqelosgivenumerous references to the Glory of the Lord in their description ofJacob’s vision of the ladder.23Alexander, “3Enoch,” inOTP,1.223–315(305).24MSS—Chavod;MSR—Chavod;MSF—Chsavod.SeeTolkovaja paleja1477goda,101b; Kushelev-Bezborodko,Pamjatniki starinnoj russkoj literatury,3.28;Franko,Apokrifi,1.110.25See Lunt, “Ladder of Jacob,”408,n.2.i."},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"406the jacob traditionTargum Pseudo-Jonathanto Gen.28:13–17reads:And, behold, the Glory of the Lord (\u0006\u000b\u000e\u0007\u0014\u0003) stood beside him and saidto him, “I am the Lord, the God of your father Abraham and the Godof Isaac.

Engraving on the Throne might indicate anassociation with theKavodsince the Throne is the central part of theKavodimagery—the seat of the anthropomorphic Glory of the Lord.The image engraved on the Throne might be an allusion to the face,35the fiery face, since it is engraved on the fiery and glorious Throne ofthe Glory.30The same tradition can be found in rabbinic texts.Gen.

Jarl Fossum’s research36demonstrates that in some traditionsabout Jacob’s image, his “image” or “likeness” is depicted not simplyasengravedon the heavenly Throne, but asseatedupon the Throne ofGlory.37Fossum argues that this second tradition is original. Christo-pher Rowland proposed that Jacob’s image is “identical with the formof God on the throne of glory (Ezek.1:26f.).”38J. Fossum offers addi-tional support for this idea by pointing out that the Hebrew forms ofthe Greek loan wordε/κ5ν, used in the Targums andGen.

In2Enoch,theFaceofthe Lord seems to play an important role in the description of Enoch’sheavenly counterpart.2Enoch39:3–6depicts the patriarch who, duringhis short trip to the earth, retells to his children his earlier encounterwith the Face. Enoch relates:You, my children, you see my face, a human being created just likeyourselves; I am one who has seen the face of the Lord, like iron madeburning hot by a fire, emitting sparks. For you gaze into my eyes, ahuman being created just like yourselves; but I have gazed into the eyesof the Lord, like the rays of the shining sun and terrifying the eyes of ahuman being.

He also points to a certain baraita (b. Hul.91b) that seems toattests to the same tradition (139–140).38C.

For this investigation, however, another jux-taposition is most pertinent. It is a contrast between the two identitiesof the visionary: the earthly Enoch (“a human being created just likeyourselves”) and his heavenly counterpart (“the one who has seen theFace of God”). It appears that Enoch tries to describe himself in twodifferent modes of existence: as a human being who now stands beforehis children with a human face and body and as the one who has seenGod’s Face in the celestial realm. These descriptions of two conditions(earthly and celestial) occur repeatedly in tandem. It is possible that thepurpose of Enoch’s instruction to his children is not to stress the differ-ence between his human body and the Lord’s body, but to emphasizethe distinction betweenthisEnoch, a human being “created just likeyourselves,” and theotherangelic Enoch who has been standing beforethe Lord’s face. Enoch’s previous transformation into the glorious oneand his initiation intoSar ha-Panimin2En.22.7support this suggestion.It is unlikely that Enoch somehow completely abandoned his supra-angelic status and his unique place before the Face of the Lord grantedto him in the previous chapters. An account of Enoch’s permanentinstallation can be found in chapter36where the Lord tells Enoch,before his short visit to the earth, that a place has been prepared forhim and that he will be in the front of Lord’s face “fromnowand for-ever.”42Finally, in chapter43,43Enoch introduces himself to his childrenas the Governor44of the World.45This title gives additional proof for thefact that the permanent installation of Enoch-Metatron in the heavenlyoffices, including the office of the Prince of the World (\u0002\u000f\f\u0006\u0007\b), hasalready taken place. The importance of this account for the idea of41Andersen, “2Enoch,”163.422Enoch36:3. Andersen, “2Enoch,”161.43A similar testimony can also be found in the passage of2Enochpreserved in theSlavonic collection of ethical writings, “The Just Balance” (Merilo Pravednoe), in whichthe existence of2Enochwas first made public. Cf. M.N. Tihomirov,Merilo Pravednoe porukopisi XIV veka(Moscow: AN SSSR,1961).44Andersen translates the title as “the manager of the arrangements on earth,” seeAndersen, “2Enoch,”217.45On this title of Enoch and its connection with the office of the Prince of theWorld, see Orlov, “Titles of Enoch-Metatron in2Enoch,”82–85."},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"410the jacob traditionthe heavenly counterpart in2Enochis apparent because it points to thesimultaneous existence of Enoch’s angelic double installed in heavenand its human counterpart, whom God sends periodically on mission-ary errands. Targumic and rabbinic Jacob accounts also attest to thisview of the heavenly counterpart when they depict angels beholdingJacob as one who at one and the same time is installed in heaven and issleeping on earth.46The idea about the heavenly counterpart of the visionary found in2Enochis also present in another early Enochic account. One of thebooklets of1(Ethiopic) Enochattests a similar tradition. Scholars havepreviously observed47that theSimilitudesseem to entertain the idea ofthe heavenly twin of a visionary when it identifies Enoch with the Sonof Man.48For a long time, students of the Enochic traditions were puz-zled by the fact that the Son of Man, who in previous chapters oftheSimilitudeshas been distinguished from Enoch, becomes suddenlyidentified in1Enoch71with the patriarch. James VanderKam suggeststhat this puzzle can be explained by the Jewish notion, attested inseveral ancient Jewish texts, that a creature of flesh and blood couldhave a heavenly double or counterpart.49To provide an example, Van-derKam points to Jacob’s traditions in which the patriarch’s “featuresare engraved on high.”50He stresses that this theme of the visionary’signorance of his higher angelic identity is observable, for example, inPrayer of Joseph.46Ta r g.

Fletcher-Louis,Luke-Acts: Angels, Christology and Soteriol-ogy(WUNT,2/94; Tübingen: Mohr/Siebeck,1997),151.48It is important to note that in theSimilitudes, the Son of Man is depicted asseated on the Throne of Glory. See1En.62:5;69:29. Fossum observes that “in the‘Similitudes’ the ‘Elect One’ or ‘Son of Man’ who identified as the patriarch Enoch, isenthroned upon the ‘throne of glory.’ If ‘glory’ does not qualify the throne but its occu-pant, Enoch is actually identified with the Glory of God.” Fossum further concludesthat “...the ‘Similitudes of Enoch’ present an early parallel to the targumic descriptionof Jacob being seated upon the ‘throne of glory’” (The Image of the Invisible God),145.49VanderKam, “Righteous One, Messiah, Chosen One, and Son of Man,”182–183.50VanderKam, “Righteous One, Messiah, Chosen One, and Son of Man,”182–183."},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"the face as the heavenly counterpart of the visionary 411It is noteworthy that in theSimilitudes, similarly in2EnochandLad-der,51the theme of the heavenly counterpart seems to conflate with theimagery of God’sKavod.1Enoch71:5reports that Enoch is brought byMichael to the fiery structure, surrounded by the rivers of living fire,which he describes as “a something built of crystal stones, and in themiddle of those stones tongues of living fire.”52There is no doubt that the fiery “structure” in theSimilitudesrepre-sents the Throne of Glory, which, in another booklet of1Enoch,isalsodescribed as the crystal structure issuing streams of fire.53An explicitreference to the Throne of Glory in1En.71:8,54immediately after thedescription of the fiery “crystal” structure, makes this clear.Similarities between1Enoch71and2Enoch22in the depictions ofKavodand Enoch’s transformation near the Throne of Glory are alsoapparent.a. In both accounts (1En.71:3–5and2En.22:6), Enoch is brought tothe Throne by archangel Michael.b. Angelology of the Throne in1Enoch,asin2EnochandLadder,55includes three classes of angelic beings: ophanim, cherubim andseraphim.c. Both Enochic accounts speak about the transformation of thevisionary. Enoch’s metamorphosis in1Enoch71recalls the descrip-tion of the luminous transformation of Enoch into a glorious heav-enly being from2En.22:8–9.d. In both cases, the transformation takes place in front of the fiery“structure,” a possible source of both transformations.51A notable detail in the description is that during his ascension Enoch, in a mannersimilar to Jacob’s vision of the ladder, sees the angelic “movements” and the angelic“faces.” In1En.71:1he reports about “...the sons of the holy angels treading uponflames of fire, and their garments (were) white, and their clothing, and the light of theirface (was) like snow” (Knibb,The Ethiopic Book of Enoch,2.165).52Knibb,The Ethiopic Book of Enoch,2.166.53In theBook of the Watchers14:18–19the Throne of Glory is also described as acrystal structure surrounded of the rivers of fire. The reference to “crystal” structurealso recalls the depiction of the Throne in Ezek.1.26, where it is described as a throneof sapphire (\u0007\u0003\u0005\r).541En.71:7: “And round about (were) the Seraphim, and the Cherubim, and theOphannim; these are they who do not sleep, but keep watch over the throne of hisglory” (Knibb,The Ethiopic Book of Enoch,2.166).55TheLadderalso refers to three classes of angels, ophanim (many-eyed ones),cherubim and seraphim, right after the remark about the Throne: “...the fiery Throneof Glory ... and the many-eyed (ones) just I saw in my dream, holding the four-facedcherubim, bearing also the many-eyed seraphim” (Lunt, “Ladder of Jacob,”408)."},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"412the jacob traditione. Studies in the past have noted that in both accounts the transfor-mation of the visionary takes place in the context of the angelicliturgy (2En.21:1–22.10;1En.71:11–12).56The same feature is alsoobservable inLadder2.15–18.f. In both accounts Enoch falls on his face before the Throne.57g. The manner in which Enoch is greeted near the Throne of Gloryin1En.71:14–17evokes the scene from2En.22:5–6,wheretheLord personally greets Enoch. In both accounts we have an ad-dress in which the visionary is informed about his “eternal” sta-tus.58These features of both Enochic accounts, entertaining the idea of theheavenly twin, point to the importance of the vision of theKavodin theprocess of acquiring knowledge about the heavenly counterparts of thevisionaries. It is not coincidental that in Jacob’s tradition, which alsoattests the idea of the heavenly counterpart, the vision of God’s gloryalso becomes an important theophanic motif. It is clearly recognizablein the targumic Jacob’s accounts and theLadder, where reports aboutJacob’s angelic counterpart are creatively conflated with theophanictraditions about the vision of God’sKavod.Uriel-Sariel-PhanuelAnother prominent trait that links Jacob’s account in theLadderwithboth above mentioned Enochic accounts (1En.71and2En.22)isthereference to the angel Sariel, also known in various traditions under thenames of Phanuel and Uriel.5956Fletcher-Louis,Luke-Acts,154.571En.71:11: “And I fell upon my face” (Knibb,The Ethiopic Book of Enoch,2.166);2En.21:2: “I fell on my face” (Andersen, “2[Slavonic Apocalypse of] Enoch,”135).581En.71:14–15: “You are the Son of Man who was born to righteousness, andrighteousness remains over you...and so you will have it for ever and for ever and ever”(Knibb,The Ethiopic Book of Enoch,2.166–167);2En.22:5–6:“Bebrave,Enoch!Don’tbe frightened! Stand up, and stand in front of my faceforever”(Andersen,“2Enoch,”138–139).59J. Smith observes that in five instances in1Enoch(40:9;54:6;71:8,9,13), confinedto theSimilitudes, Phanuel replaces Uriel in a catalog of the four archangels. He alsopoints out that while Sariel is a relatively unknown angelic figure, his name seems tobe quite frequently conflated with Uriel, as in1En.9:1. Cf. J.Z. Smith, “Prayer ofJoseph,” inOTP,2.699–714(708–709). For the discussion about Uriel/Sariel/Phanuel,see J.

In fact, the angelicname “Phanuel” might be a title which stresses the celestial status ofUriel/Sariel62as one of the servants of the divinePanim.63The title “Phanuel” is reminiscent of the terminology found in var-ious Jacob’s accounts.

This tradition can be found, for example, in3En.45:1;47:1;48D:8.3Enochalso uses an expression “the Curtain (pargod)ofthePlace”in reference to the celestial veil, which shields the angelic hosts from the harmfulluminescence of theKavod.65G. Vermes suggests that the angelic name Phanuel “is depended on the Peniel/Penuel of Genesis32.” Cf. Vermes, “The Impact of the Dead Sea Scrolls on JewishStudies,”13. Smith supports Vermes’ position. In his opinion, “it is most likely that thename Phanuel is to be derived from the place name Peniel/Penuel (the face of God) inGenesis32:30, and therefore may be related to the title ‘a man seeing God’” (Smith,"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"414the jacob traditionAlthough theLadder’s narrative does not directly refer to the angelnamed Phanuel, it uses another of his names, Sariel, in reference tothe angelic being, who interprets Jacob’s dream and announces to himhis new angelic status, depicted symbolically in the changing of thepatriarch’s name to Israel. TheLadder of Jacob2portrays Jacob askingGod in prayer for help in interpreting the dream. Chapter3of theLadderrelates that God responds to Jacob’s prayer by commanding:“Sariel, leader of those who comfort, you who in charge of dreams,go and make Jacob understand the meaning of the dream.” The textfurther depicts the angelophany of Sariel who comes to the patriarch toinform him about his new angelic name and status.This reference to Sariel/Uriel as the angel who instructs/wrestleswith Jacob and announces to him his new angelic name is documentedin several other sources, includingTargum NeofitiandPrayer of Joseph.InPrayer of Joseph, Jacob attests that “Uriel, the angel of God, cameforth and said that ‘I [Jacob-Israel] had descended to earth and I hadtabernacled among men and that I had been called by the name ofJacob’.

When he saw that he could not prevail against him, hetouched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh becamebenumbed in his wrestling with him. And he said: “Let me go becausethe rise of the dawn has arrived, and because the time of the angels onhigh to praise has arrived, and I am a chief of those who praise” (\u000e\u0004\u000e\f\u000e\u0003\u0011\u0016\b\u0012\u000f\b\u0003\u0007). And he said: “I will not let you go unless you bless me.”And he said to him: “What is your name?” And he said: “Jacob.” And hesaid: “Your name shall no longer be called Jacob but Israel, because youhave claimed superiority with angels from before the Lord and with menand you have prevailed against them. And Jacob asked and said: “Tellme your name I pray”; and he said: “Why, now, do you ask my name?”And he blessed him there. And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel“Prayer of Joseph,”709). See also S. Olyan, who argues that “the angel Penuel waseither derived from texts such Exod.13:14–15and Deut.4:37, where the divine presenceis given figurative treatment, or it emerged from the exegesis of Gen.32:25–33”(Olyan,A Thousand Thousands Served Him,108–109).66Smith, “Prayer of Joseph,”713."},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"the face as the heavenly counterpart of the visionary 415(\u000f\u000e\u0003\u0004\u0005) because: “I have seen angels from before the Lord face to faceand my life has been spared.”67Scholars have previously noted that “in the circles represented by theSimilitudes of Enoch, Qumran and Neofiti variety of the PalestinianTargum, the angelic adversary of Jacob was recognized as one of thefour celestial princes and called alternatively Sariel or Phanuel.”68Itappears thatLadderalso belongs to the same circles. InTarg. Neof.andFrag. Targ.69to Gen32:27, Sariel is defined as “the chief of those whogive praise” (\u000e\u0003\u0011\u0016\b\u0012\u000f\b\u0003\u0007). TheLadderseems to allude to this title. IntheLadder3:2Sariel is described as “stareishino uslazhdaemych”70whichcan be translated as “the chief of those who give joy.”71It is of interest to note that in theLadder, Sariel/Phanuel imageryseems to be influenced by the Enochic tradition even more extensivelythan in the Targums; in theLadder, the motif of wrestling is completelyabsent and is replaced by the depiction of Sariel as the interpreter ofdreams. It seems that Sariel/Uriel in theLadderassumes the traditional“Enochic” functions ofangelus interpres.72Princes of the FaceIn theLadderand thePrayer of Joseph, Jacob’s identification with hisheavenly counterpart, the angel Israel, involves the initiatory encounterwith the angel Sariel/Uriel, who in other texts is also known as Phan-uel, the angel of the Divine Presence or the Face.

The installation of a visionaryasSar ha-Panimseems to correlate with the procedure of identifying avisionary with his heavenly counterpart.74In1Enoch71, Enoch is trans-formed and identified with the Son of Man in front of God’s Throne.In2En.22:6–10, Enoch’s initiation into one of the Princes of Presence75also takes place in front of the fiery Face of the Lord. This encountertransforms Enoch into a glorious being. It is important to note thatafter this procedure Enoch observes that he hadbecome like one of the glo-rious ones,andthere was no observable difference.76The last phrase describesEnoch’s transition to his new identity as “one of the glorious ones.”This identity might refer to his angelic counterpart. It also indicatesthat Enoch’s earthly appearance/face has been radically altered andthat the visionary has now acquired a new “face” which “mirrors” or“doubles” the Face of the Lord.77The motif of engraving the imageof the visionary on the Throne might also serve as a metaphor for73For a complete discussion about angels as the heavenly counterparts of humans,see De Conick,Seek to See Him,148–157.74The reference to the angels of the Presence as the heavenly counterparts ofhumans is not confined solely to the Jewish pseudepigrapha. April De Conick’s researchrefers to several important Christian passages in which angels of the Presence/the Faceserve as heavenly counterparts of humans; see De Conick,Seek to See Him,153–154.Oneof such traditions is reflected in Mt.18:10: “See that you do not despise one of theselittle ones; for I tell you that in heaven their angels always behold the face of my Fatherwho is in heaven.”75On Enoch’s role as the Prince of the Presence in2Enoch, see Orlov, “Titles ofEnoch-Metatron in2Enoch,”74–75.76Andersen, “2Enoch,”139.77A visionary, therefore, becomes a reflection or even a “representation” of theFace/Kavod, a sort of its vice-regent. Christopher Morray-Jones observes that “thereis evidence, then, of the early existence of a tradition concerning the ascent to heavenof an exceptionally righteous man who beholds the vision of the divineKaboduponMerkabah, is transformed into an angelic being and enthroned as celestial vice-regent,thereby becoming identified with the Name-bearing angel who either is or is closelyassociated with theKaboditself and functions as a second, intermediary power in"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"the face as the heavenly counterpart of the visionary 417the similarity between the visionary’s face and the Face. There is nodoubt that one of the features which unifies both “faces” is their lumi-nosity.2Enoch’snarrative gives evidence that Enoch’s face acquired the samequalities of luminosity as the Face of the Lord. In2Enoch37, the Lordcalls one of his angels to chill the face of Enoch before his return toearth. The angel, who “appeared frigid,” then chilled Enoch’s face withhis icy hands. Immediately after this procedure, the Lord tells Enochthat if his face had not been chilled in such a way, no human beingwould be able to look at his face. This chilling procedure indicates thatEnoch’s metamorphosis near the Face into theSar ha-Paniminvolvesthe transformation of the visionary’s face into the fiery, perilous entitywhich now resemblesKavod. We can find a detailed description of thisprocess in another “Enochic” text,Sefer Hekhalot, which describes thetransformation of Enoch/Metatron, the Prince of the Divine Presence,into the fiery creature:R. Ishmael said: The angel Metatron, Prince of the Divine Presence, theglory of highest heaven, said to me: When the Holy One, blessed be he,took me to serve the throne of glory, the wheels of the chariot and allneeds of the Shekinah, at once my flesh turned to flame, my sinews toblazing fire, my bones to juniper coals, my eyelashes to lightning flashes,my eyeballs to fiery torches, the hairs of my head to hot flames, all mylimbs to wings of burning fire, and the substance of my body to blazingfire.78It is possible that the reference to the heavenly counterpart of Jacobin the form of his image (engraved) on the Throne of Glory alsoimplies that Jacob is one of the servants of the Divine Face. Thispossibility is already hinted at in the biblical account where Jacobis attested as one who saw God face to face.79Moreover, in someof Jacob’s traditions, he is directly described (in a manner similar toEnoch/Metatron) as the Prince of the Divine Face. We learn about thistitle from thePrayer of Joseph8,80where Jacob-Israel himself unveils hisheaven” (C.R.A. Morray-Jones, “Transformational Mysticism in the Apocalyptic-Mer-kabah Tradition,”JJS43[1992]10–11).783En.15:1.

TheLadder of JacobandPrayer of Joseph,aswell as the biblical account of Jacob’s vision, are silent about any trans-formation of Jacob’s body and his face. This tradition, however, can befound in another prominent account connected with the Jacob story.85In this important material, the eyes of Jacob, similar to the eyes of thetransformed Metatron, are emitting flashes of lighting.81Vermes notices thatTa r g u m N e o fi t iexplains the etymology of Israel from\u0007\u0007\b(“torule, to act as a prince”); see Vermes, “The Impact of the Dead Sea Scrolls on JewishStudies,”13.82Gieschen,Angelomorphic Christology,141–142.83The fact that Sariel/Uriel/Phanuel is known under several names might indicatethat this angel also serves as a heavenly counterpart in the manner similar to otherservants of the Face such as Jacob/Israel, Enoch/Metatron, and possibly Melchizedek/Michael. On the identification of Michael with Melchizedek, see J.R. Davila, “Mel-chizedek, Michael, and War in Heaven,” inSBLSP35(1996),259–272; D.D. Hannah,Michael and Christ: Michael Traditions and Angel Christology in Early Christianity(WUNT,2/109; Tübingen: Mohr/Siebeck,1999),70–74.84Olyan refers to Rashi’s passage which identifies “the ‘angel of his presence’ of Isa.63:9with Michael, the Prince of Presence” (Olyan,A Thousand Thousands Served Him,108).85The beginning of the second half ofJoseph and Asenethgives a description of Josephand Aseneth visiting Jacob.Jos. and Asen.22:7–8says that when Aseneth saw Jacob, she“was amazed at his beauty... his eyes (were) flashing and darting (flashes of) lighting,and his sinews and his shoulders and his arms were like (those) of an angel, and histhighs and his calves and his feet like (those) of a giant. And Jacob was like a man whohad wrestled with God. And Aseneth saw him and was amazed, and prostrated herselfbefore him face down to the ground” (C. Burchard, “Joseph and Aseneth,” inOTP,2.177–247[238])."},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"the face as the heavenly counterpart of the visionary 419ConclusionFinally, it is necessary to address the question why some theophanictraditions depict angelic beings as both the servants of the Face andthe Face itself. Later Merkabah accounts categorize Metatron as theFace of God.86The reference to Uriel/Sariel, who is also known asPhanuel (“the Face of God”), can serve as another example. This ambi-guity in the theophanic tradition is also apparent in the SlavonicLadderof Jacob, where the fiery Face can be taken as either God’sKavodoran enthroned vice-regent associated with the Face (i.e. the enthronedJacob-Israel). The difficulty in discerning between these two luminousentities can be illustrated through a reference to a late “Enochic” pas-sage (3En.), describing the enthronement of Metatron at the door of theseventh palace. From this account we learn that when one infamousvisionary encountered the enthroned Metatron, he took it as some-thing equal to the Chariot. Then, according to the story, the vision-ary opened his mouth and uttered: “There are indeed two powers87inheaven!”88Besides other things, this account might serve as:1. an additional evidence that some heavenly counterparts are in-deed “mirrors” of the Face;2. an important lesson about the evasive nature of the celestial“faces”; and3. a warning about the possible perils for those who try to explainwhat these “faces” might really represent.86For the identification of Metatron with the Face, see De Conick, “HeavenlyTemple Traditions and Valentinian Worship,”329; D.J. Halperin,The Faces of theChariot(TSAJ,16; Tübingen: Mohr/Siebeck,1988),424–425.

Charles, Morfill, and Bonwetsch3thought that the theme of Melchizedek was a sort of appendix anddid not belong to the main body of the text. For this reason, thelegend was not investigated for a long time. Even Fred Horton in hisfundamental work dedicated to the Melchizedek tradition ignores thematerial of2Enochon the basis that it is found only in one recension.4On the contrary to these opinions, A. Vaillant successfully demonstratesthat Melchizedek’s legend is an integral part of2Enoch.F.Andersensupports this position. His new collation of manuscripts shows that theMelchizedek tradition is found in both recensions, in six manuscriptswhich represent four text families. His final conclusion is that “there isno evidence that the second part ever existed separately.”5ExpositionThe Melchizedek narrative occupies the last chapters of the book. Thecontent of the story is connected with the family of Nir,6the priest,3Cf. R.H. Charles and W.R. Morfill.,The Book of the Secrets of Enoch(Oxford:Clarendon Press,1896); G.N.

There were a number of attempts to interpret this enigmatic name.One of them was Vaillant’s hypothesis that Slavonic “Nir” equals Semitic\u0007\u0004,andcanbe taken in its etymological sense as “light.” He supports his opinion by referring toEthiopic Enoch, since Nir, the brother of Noah, is in2Enocha “dedoublement” ofNoah, who was described as the wonder child in1Enoch106. Vaillant, xii. Vaillant’sargument probably refers to the “light-like appearence” of Noah in Ethiopic Enoch:“His eyes are like the rays of the sun, and his face glorious” (106:5). The hypothesishas many weak points. Rubinstein shows the difficulty of this explanation, because the“dedoublement” of Noah inSlavonic Enochis related to the description of Melchizedek,not Nir (see our discussion about Noah-Melchizedek’s birth). Rubinstein also stressesthat there is nothing miraculous about Nir in2Enochandhe(Nir)canbedescribedasa “sacerdotal drudge.” Rubinstein,Observations,17–18. Rubinstein notes a remote pos-sibility that the name of Nir was chosen with an eye to the figurative use of the term\u0007\u0004in the Old Testament for the description of “dominion” of David’s descendants. Hefurther suggests that “it is not impossible that an oral exegesis of the Melchizedek leg-end inSlavonic Enochsomehow connected Melchizedek and Nir with Davidic descent,though the fact that Nir is only said to have adopted Melchizedek is an obvious dif-ficulty.” Rubinstein,Observations,18. Finally, J. Milik argues that Nir “certainly means‘luminary,’ because the author of2Enochdoubtless drew on the name of the wife of"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"426the melchizedek traditionwho is pictured in the book as “second son of Lamech”7and thebrother of Noah. Sothonim8the wife of Nir, gave birth to a child “inher old age,”9right “on the day of her death.”10She conceived thechild, “being sterile” and “without having slept with her husband.”11The book narrates that Nir the priest had not slept with her from theday that the Lord had appointed him in front of the face of the people.Therefore, Sothonim hid herself during all the days of her pregnancy.12Finally, when she was at the day of birth, Nir remembered his wifeand called her to himself in the temple. She came to him and he sawthat she was pregnant. Nir, filled with shame, wanted to cast her fromNoah,Νωρ\u000eα, meaning ‘Fire of God.’” Milik,The Books of Enoch,115. In my opinion,one more possible explanation of the name Nir can be suggested. This interpretationcan be connected with the meaning of Nir as “clearing, breaking ground or earth.”M. Jastrow in his dictionary defines\u0007\u0003\u0004as “to break ground,” “to clear.” Cf. M.

According to Jastrow it can mean “new broken land’ insome instances. In2Enochthe destiny of Nir is connected with “clearing of the Earth.”The Lord told him that He planned “to send down a great destruction on the earth.”Nir is the last priest before the great destruction of the Flood. At the very end of2Enoch, Nir says: “For I know indeed that this race will end in confusion, and everyonewill perish, except that Noah, my brother, will be preserved in that generation for pro-creation.” Nir is indeed the man who beheld the future “clearing, breaking down” ofthe earth, therefore it is possible that his name reflects this coming situation.7Slav.Nira syna Lamehova btorago.8Slav.Sofonimü, Sofonima. Rubinstein tries to connect this proper name with thefacts of Sothonim’s biography. He draws attention to the details of the story: Sothonimwho had been described earlier as old and on the point of death, falls dead at Nir’sfeet and while Nir is away, having gone to inform Noah of Sothonim’s death, the infantMelchizedek emerges from her body. Rubinstein believes that it is highly probable thatthe author of2Enochhad in mind the story of Benjamin’s birth in Gen35:18.Racheltravailed, and had a difficult labor and as her soul was departing ... she called hisname Ben-oni..., i.e. the son of my sorrow. Rubinstein further suggests that the nameSothonim may well mean “the end of afflictions,” “the end of sorrows”—in Hebrew,\u0002\u0003\u0004\f\u000e\u001f\f\r—symbolic of Sothonim’s release from the feelings of shame and sorrow duringher pregnancy and her dispute with Nir.

He mentioned that the phonetic pattern ofthe name could be traced to the Hebrew word\u0002\u0003\u0004\f\u0005\u001d, hidden or mysteries.

Melchizedek13was born from Sothonim’scorpse. When Nir and Noah came in to bury Sothonim, they saw thechild sitting beside the corpse with “his clothing on him.” Accordingto the story they were terrified because the child was fully developedphysically. The child spoke with his lips and he blessed the Lord.It is of great significance that the newborn child was marked by thesign of priesthood. The story describes how “the badge of priesthood”14was on his chest, and it was glorious in appearance. Nir and Noahdressed the child in the garments of priesthood and they fed him theholy bread. They decided to hide him, fearing that the people wouldhave him put to death. Finally, the Lord commanded His archangelGabriel15to take the child and place him16in “the paradise Eden” sothat he might become the high priest after the Flood. Final passages ofthe short recension describe the ascent of Melchizedek on the wings ofGabriel to the paradise Eden.Shem TraditionsThe Melchizedek narrative in the book is connected with the nameof Noah, the legendary pre-deluge patriarch. We can not only findNoah in the book but also his grandfather, Methuselah17and his father,Lamech. The midrashim of these descendants of Enoch occupy chap-ters68–73of the text. Right after Enoch’s ascension to the highestheaven, the firstborn son of Enoch, Methuselah, and his brothers, “thesons of Enoch,” constructed an altar at Achuzan,18the place whereEnoch had been taken up (ch.68). It is important to stress that the termAchuzanhere is a specific name for the hill of the Temple in Jerusalem.In chapter69the Lord appeared to Methuselah in a night vision andappointed him as the priest before the people. Verses11–16of this chap-ter describe the first animal sacrifice of Methuselah on the altar.

The text does not explain why the Lord wanted topass on the priesthood to Nir instead of Noah—Lamech’s firstborn son.The text just mentions that the people answered on that request, “Letit be so for us, and let the word of the Lord be just as he said to you.”Further the book narrates that Methuselah invested Nir with the vest-ments of priesthood in front of the face of all the people and “madehim stand at the head of altar.”19As shown,2Enochpresents Melchizedek as a continuation of thepriestly line from Methuselah, son of Enoch, directly to the secondson of Lamech, Nir (brother of Noah), and on to Melchizedek.2Enochtherefore considers Melchizedek as the grandson of Lamech. This un-derstanding of Melchizedek as the continuation of the priestly line ofdescendants of Enoch has interesting parallels in rabbinic literature.In the Babylonian Talmud the following passage is found:R. Zechariah said on R. Ishmael’s authority: The Holy One, blessed beHe, intended to bring forth the priesthood from Shem, as it is written,‘And he [Melchizedek] was the priest of the most high God’ (Gen14:18).But because he gave precedence in his blessing to Abraham over God,He brought it forth from Abraham; as it is written, ‘And he blessed himand said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heavenand earth, and blessed be the most high God’ (Gen14:19). Said Abrahamto him, ‘Is the blessing of a servant to be given precedence over that ofhis master?’ Straightway it [the priesthood] was given to Abraham, asit is written (Ps.110:1), ‘The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at myright hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool;’ which is followedby,‘TheLordhathsworn,andwillnotrepent,Thouartapriestforever, after the order of Melchizedek’ (Ps.110:4), meaning, ‘because of theword of Melchizedek.’ Hence it is written, And he was a priest of themost High God, [implying that] he was a priest, but not his seed (b.Ned.32b).20This identification of Melchizedek with Shem, son of Noah, descen-dant of Methuselah and Lamech by Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha wasvery popular in rabbinic literature.21We can find the origins of the tra-19Andersen, “2Enoch,”197–203.20The Babylonian Talmud. Seder Nedarim(London: Soncino Press,1936),98–99.21Two other rabbinic evidences that attest Melchizedek as Shem includePirke R. El.andGen. Rab.Pirke R. El. has two references to Melchizedek-Shem. The first referenceoccurs in the passage dedicated to the handling of the tradition of intercalation amongthe Patriarchs. The text says that “Noah handled on the tradition to Shem, and he"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"melchizedek legend of2(slavonic)enoch429dition from a very early time; identifying Melchizedek as Shem can befound in the Targums,22Aramaic renderings of the Hebrew Bible.Tg.Neof.onGen14:18shows the exegetical development of this identifica-tion: “And Melchisedech, king of Jerusalem—he is Shem the Great—brought out bread and wine, for he was the priest who ministered inthe high priesthood before the most High God.”23TheTg. Ps.-J.holdsa similar exegetical position when it reads: “... the righteous king—that is Shem, the son of Noah—king of Jerusalem, went out to meetAbram, and brought him bread and wine; at that time he was minister-ing before God Most High.”24Biblical chronology proves the possibilityof the meeting of Shem (Melchizedek) and Abraham after the defeatof the kings (Gen14:17). According to Gen11:10–26,Shemlived500years after the birth of his first son Arphaxad. There were290yearsbetween the birth of Arphaxad and the birth of Abram. When Abramwas initiated in the principle of intercalation; he intercalated the years and he wascalled a priest, as it is said, “And Melchizedek king of Salem ... was a priest of GodMost High” (Gen14:18). Was Shem the Son of Noah a priest? But because he was thefirst-born, and because he ministered to his God by day and by night, therefore washe called a priest.”PirkedeRabbiEliezer. Translated by Gerald Friedländer (New York:Hermon,1965),53. The second reference to Melchizedek-Shem inPirke R. El. occurs inthe chapter28where we can find the following passage: “Rabbi Joshua said: Abrahamwas the first to begin to give a tithe. He took all the tithe of the kings and all the titheof the wealth of Lot, the son of his brother, and gave (it) to Shem, the Son of Noah, asit is said, ‘And he gave him a tenth of all.’”PirkedeRabbiEliezer.TranslatedbyGeraldFriedländer (New York: Hermon,1965),195.Gen. Rab. gives a very interesting interpretation to the fear of Abram after hismeeting with Melchizedek. It says: “Fear not, Abram. Whom did he fear? RabbiBerekiah said: He feared Shem (whose descendants, viz. Chedorlaomer and his sons,Abraham had slain), as it is written, ‘The isles saw, and feared’ (Isa41:5): just as islandsstand out in the sea, so were Abraham and Shem outstanding in the world. Andfeared: Each one feared the other. The former (Abraham) feared the latter, thinking,perhaps he nurses resentment against me for slaying his sons. And the latter (Shem)feared the former, thinking, Perhaps he nurses resentment against me for begettingwicked offspring.”Midrash Rabbah(10vols.; London: Soncino Press,1961),1.365.Thispassage shows that not only was Melchizedek Shem, but the four kings of the Elamiteopposition were sons of Shem.22Only theTg. Onq. does not mention Shem in connection with Melchizedek. Theinteresting fact here is thatTg. Onq. is the only targum which also shows a negativeattitude toward Enoch: “and Enoch walked in reverence of the Lord, then he was nomore, for the Lord has caused him to die (Gen.5,24).” B.

According to Gen25:7Abraham lived175years. Therefore Shem in fact outlived Abraham by35years.Another important point in identification of Shem and Melchizedekis the fact that the blessing of Shem in Gen9:26has distinct parallelswith the blessing which Melchizedek gives to Abraham. Fred Hortonproves that both blessings have some similarities from “a form-criticalstandpoint.”25It is interesting to note several important similarities between targu-mic and rabbinic material and Melchizedek’s portion of2Enoch.a.2Enochas well as targumic and rabbinic sources tried to put thegenealogy of Melchizedek into the Semitic context of Enoch’s descen-dants. They endeavored to give this abstract and ahistorical characterof Genesis a certain historical location and place him in the context ofthe pre-Deluge generation.b. Both traditions are interested in the descriptions of the priestly func-tions of Enoch’s family.262Enochhas a lengthy account of Methuse-lah and Nir with elaborate descriptions of their priestly and sacrificialduties and practices. As Rubinstein notes, “it is hard to escape theimpression that the purpose of the account is to build up the priestlyantecedents of Melchizedek.”27The main point of the passage fromb.Ned. as well as fromGen. Rab.andPirke R. El. is the building up ofthe priestly antecedents of Melchizedek (Shem) in the context of thetransmission of this priestly line to Abraham.c. Both traditions are also interested in taking away the priestly linefrom Enoch’s historical descendants.b. Ned.32b stressed about Shem-Melchizedek, “he was priest; but not his seed.” Melchizedek’s finaltranslation to heaven at the end of2Enochalso shows discontinuationof the historical priestly line of Enoch’s relatives. In the text, the Lordsays: “Melchizedek will be my priest to all priests,28and I will sanctify25Horton,117.26Sacchi notes that the Melchizedek story in2Enochgives “the impression of a workthat develops an Enochic priestly tradition in the midst of the problems of first-centuryJewish thought, with particular reference to the relation between the function of Enochand those of Melchizedek.” Cf. P. Sacchi,Jewish Apocalyptic and Its History,234–235.27Rubinstein,5.28Andersen notices that this detail is one more piece of evidence against Christian"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"melchizedek legend of2(slavonic)enoch431him and I will change him into a great people who will sanctify me...Melchizedek will be the head of the priests in another generation.”29d. Another important point, which can be found in observations ofthe rabbinic and2Enochsources, is that the text of theSlavonic Enochattempts to build an alternative to the traditional rabbinic line fromMethuselah’s priestly vocation, which can be some type of parallel tothe official Noah-Shem line. The important theological role in this shiftis played by previously unknown Nir, the young brother of Noah.30We can see some sort of theological polemic by the author of2Enochwith traditional Jewish (targumic, rabbinic) positions. It shows that thetraditional Jewish settings of the Oral Torah about Melchizedek asShem were very important and authoritative for the audience of2Enocheven in the situation of their rejection.Noachic TraditionsOur previous analysis of Shem traditions in the Melchizedek storyreveals also some references to the Noachic tradition.31A substitutionof the line Noah-Shem for the line Nir-Melchizedek shows that one ofthe main targets of the author’s polemic in2Enochis in fact a Noahfigure. It is not a coincidence that this sort of polemic takes placein the Enochic narrative. From the earliest Enochic materials we cansee the interdependence of Noachic and Enochic traditions. Kvanvigshows that in Noachic traditions Noah and Enoch often appear in theauthorship of2Enoch. He says that “the fantastic details about this priest conflict withChristian belief in Jesus as God’s sole legitimate priest in heaven.” Andersen,96.29Andersen,209.30This substitution of Nir for Noah could be also viewed as a polemic with Noachictradition. See our analysis of Noachic tradition.31On Noachic traditions see: L. Bailey,Noah: the Person and the Story in History andTradition(Columbia, South Carolina: University of South Carolina,1989); F.

Lamech suspects that his wife Bathenoshwas unfaithful to him and that “the conception was (the work) of theWatchers and the pregnancy of the Holy Ones, and it belonged tothe Nephil[in].”35The story of the relationship between Lamech andBathenosh found in theApocryphonis very similar to the story of therelationships between Nir and Sothonim. However, there are someessential differences between the texts. In the Qumran text the wife ofLamech, in response to his angry questions, tries to remind him of theirintimacies—“Oh my brother and lord! remember my sexual pleasure... [...] in the heat of intercourse, and the gasping of my breath in mybreast.”36She swears that the seed was indeed of Lamech: “I swear toyou by the Great Holy One, by the King of the hea[vens...]...[...] thatthis seed comes from you, [...] and not from any foreigner nor fromany of the watchers or sons of heav[en].”3732H. Kvanvig,Roots of Apocalyptic. The Mesopotamian Background of the Enoch Figure andthe Son of Man(WMANT,61; Neukirchen–Vluyn: Neukirchener Verlag,1988),117.33Another similar motif in the Noachic traditions is the story of Noah’s birth in1Enoch106, who appears also as a marvellous child. The story in1Enoch106–107says:“And after (some) days my son Methuselah took for his son Lamech a wife, and shebecame pregnant by him and bore a son. And his body was white like snow and redlike the flower of a rose, and the hair of his head (was) white like wool...and his eyes(were) beautiful; and when he opened his eyes, he made the whole house bright like thesun so that the whole house was exceptionally bright. And when he was taken from thehand of the midwife, he opened his mouth and spoke to the Lord of Righteousness.And his father Lamech was afraid of him and fled and went to his father Methuselah.And he said to him: ‘I have begotten a strange son; he is not like a man, but is likethe children of the angels of heaven, of a different type, and not like us.

She answered Nir: “O my lord! Behold, itis the time of my old age, and there was not in me any (ardor of)youth and I do not know how the indecency of my womb has beenconceived.”38However, some scholars draw attention to the fact thatboth texts have similar features in this situation. Delcor affirms that thephrase of Lamech in the beginning ofthe Apocryphon, “Behold, then Ithought in my heart that the conception was the work of the Watch-ers and the pregnancy, of the Holy Ones...” can be compared withthe words of Noah in2Enochspoken at the time of the examination ofMelchizedek: “This is of the Lord, my brother.”39An important sup-porting detail here is the fact that the description of Enoch and hisdescendants inGenesis Apocryphonshows a number of interesting similar-ities with2Enoch’sstory.Chapters39–66of2Enochdescribe the instruction which Enoch gaveto his sons and the elders of the people during his thirty day visit to theearth. The text makes clear that during this visit Enoch is already anangelic being. In chapter56of2Enochhe says to his son: “Listen, mychild! Since the time when the Lord anointed me with the ointment ofmy glory, it has been horrible for me, and food is not agreeable to me,and I have no desire for earthly food.”40Chapter67of2Enochdescribes the final departure of Enoch toheaven. The information about the transformed Enoch can be foundalso in theGenesis Apocryphon. The text says that when Methuselah knewabout Lamech’s suspicions he decided to ask advise from Enoch. TheGenesis Apocryphoncontinues that “he (Methuselah) left for the higherlevel, to Parvaim, and there he met Enoch, [his father...].”41Thisreference to the “higher level” can be considered as a hint for theelevated status of the translated Enoch.Apocryphonfurther says that “He(Methuselah) said to Enoch, his father: O my father and lord, to whomI have co[me...] [...] I say to you: Do not be annoyed with me becauseI came here to [...] you [...] fear (?) before you [...].”42Methuselah’s38Andersen, “2Enoch,”205.39Delcor, “Melchizedek from Genesis to the Qumran Texts and the Epistle to theHebrews,”129.40Andersen, “2Enoch,”183.41F.

The description of animal sacrifices occupies a very impor-tant place in the narrative of2Enoch. In chapter59, Enoch instructedMethuselah, his brothers—Regim, Ariim, Akhazukhan, Kharimion—and the elders of all the people how to perform animal sacrifices: “...he who brings a sacrifice of clean beasts, it is healing, he heals his soul.And he who brings a sacrifice of clean birds, it is healing, he heals hissoul. And everything which you have for food, bind it by four legs;43there is healing, he heals his soul. He who puts to death any ani-mal without binding it, it is an evil custom; he acts lawlessly with hisown soul.”44Further the book tells that right after the appointment ofMethuselah to the position of the priest he came up to the Lord’s altar“with all the people in procession behind him and he stood in front ofthe altar with all the people ... around the altar ... and ... the elders ofthe people, ... taking sheep and oxen ... tied (their) four legs together,and placed (them) at the head of the altar.”45S. Pines draws attentionto this unique practice of tying together four legs during animal sac-rifices. He refers to a passage in the Mishna (m. Tamid,4:1)which,according to the most probable interpretation, states that each of theforelegs of the sacrificial animal was tied to the corresponding hind legand declares that the tying together of all the four legs was contraryto the tradition.46Pines gives one of the two explanations found in theGemara of the Babli that this expression of disapproval was due to thefact that the customs of the heretics,minim,47should not be imitated.48The practice of tying together all four legs had very strong sectarianmeaning for the authors of Mishnaic sacrificial prescriptions.

Two features of the Gnostic text are especially valuable. First,the author’s use of the phrase “the children of Seth” (5:20), and second,his usage of the phrase “the [race] (γ\u0015ν\u0011ς) of the High priest ('ρ*ιερε!ς)49Ant.18,18.50Pines, “Eschatology and the Concept of Time in theSlavonic Book of Enoch,”75.51G. Scholem,Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism(New York: Schocken,1991),359.52The issue of possible connections between the Nag Hammadi texts and theEnochic tradition can be clarified by reference to some patristic materials. As weknow, the place of discovery of the Nag Hammadi library was close to the formersite of the Pachomian monastery at Chenoboskion. The following condemnation of the“apocryphal books” was made by patriarch Athanasius and recorded in the PachomianLives: “Who has made the simple folk believe that these books belong to Enoch eventhough no scriptures existed before Moses?” Cit. in D.

In chapter72of the shorter recension of2Enoch, the followingstatement comes from the lips of the Lord: “... and Melchizedek willbe the head of the priests in another generation as was Seth in this gen-eration.”57The author’s familiarity with the traditions which exaltedSeth, however, become evident much earlier in chapter33:10wherethe Lord promises to give Enoch an intercessor archangel Michael andguardian angels Arioch and Marioch on account of his handwritingsand the handwritings of his fathers—Adam and Seth.58Mentioning allthree traditions together shows that Sethian tradition has in the eyes of2Enoch’s author equal value to the tradition of Adam and Enoch.Melch. also gives an interesting list which includes Adam, Enoch,and Melchizedek.59Birger Pearson suggests that “the list of biblicalfigures mentioned in this passage, culminating with Melchizedek, maybe intended as a list of those heroes of the past who functioned aspriests.”60Another important testimony to Sethian tradition is found in chap-ter71where the author of2Enochdepicts a priestly line which beginswith Seth: “Therefore honor him (Melchizedek) together with your ser-vants and great priests, with Seth, and with Enoch, and Maleleil, andAamilam, and Phrasidam, and with Maleleil, and with Rusif and withEnoch and with your servant Nir...”61These testimonies to Sethian tradition show that there are obvi-ous similarities betweenMelch.and2Enoch.

It is noteworthy that this emphasis on priestly role ofSeth is a rare motif in Sethian traditions. In the variety of Sethian tra-ditions, Seth is often pictured as an astrologer, a scribe, or the head of ageneration, but he is rarely viewed as a priest.62From the other side, despite these parallels,63there is a fundamentaldivergence betweenMelch.and2Enoch. The purpose of the author ofMelch. is apparent—to place Melchizedek in the context of Sethianpriestly authority. In observations on the tractate, B. Pearson stressesthat because of the reference to the “children of Seth” (5:20), and theparallel reference to the “race of the high priest” (i.e.Melch.6:17),it is possible that inMelch., the priest-savior Melchizedek is regardedas an earthly incarnation of the heavenly Seth.64On the contrary,in2Enoch, however, there is an established attempt to challenge theSethian priestly line and replace it with a new postdiluvian priestlyauthority of Melchizedek.62On the figure of Seth and Sethian traditions cf. A. Klijn,Seth in Jewish, Christianand Gnostic Literature(SNT,46; Leiden: Brill,1977); R. Kraft, “Philo on Seth: Was PhiloAware of Traditions Which Exalted Seth and His Progeny?”The Rediscovery of Gnosticism(2vols.; ed. B. Layton; SHR,41; Leiden: Brill,1981),2.457–458; G. MacRae, “Sethin Gnostic Texts and Traditions,”SBLSP11(1977)24–43;B.Pearson,“TheFigureofSeth in Gnostic Literature,”The Rediscovery of Gnosticism(2vols.; ed. B. Layton; SHR,41;Leiden: Brill,1981),2.472–504; M. Stone, “Report on Seth traditions in the ArmenianAdam Books,”The Rediscovery of Gnosticism(2vols.; ed. B. Layton; SHR,41; Leiden:Brill,1981),2.459–471.63Several additional parallels between2EnochandMelch., which were noticed byPearson should also be mentioned. According to Pearson’s hypothesis in both textsMelchizedek appears in several historical manifestations. Pearson rightly observes thatinSlavonic EnochMelchizedek “has three different manifestations: miraculously bornbefore the Flood, serving in the post-diluvian age as a great priest, and functioningas a priest in the end-time, i.e. in messianic capacity.” Birger A. Pearson (ed.),NagHammadi Codices IX and X,30. Pearson also notes that inMelch. Melchizedek appearsin several roles: “as ancient priest and recipient of heavenly revelations of the escha-tological future, and as eschatological savior-priest identified with Jesus Christ.” BirgerA. Pearson (ed.),Nag Hammadi Codices IX and X,20.According to Pearson, another parallel between2EnochandMelch.isthatbothtexts belong to the genre “apocalypse.” Pearson notes thatMelch. “satisfies the genericrequirements of an apocalypse: it is pseudonymous, attributed to a biblical hero ofthe past, and contains purported prophecies of future events given by an angelicinformant, as well as secrets pertaining to the heavenly world, presumably in a visionaryexperience.” Birger A. Pearson (ed.),Nag Hammadi Codices IX and X,20.64B.

However, some conclusions can be made at thisstage of the research. These conclusions focus on the problem of thehypothetical community behind the Melchizedek narrative.First, the Melchizedek portion demonstrates the interest in the issuesof priestly practice, succession and authority, which occupy an impor-tant part in the eschatology of2Enoch.Second, the material reflects complicated polemics with various tra-ditions of priestly practice and the priestly succession inside Judaism.Third, the story of Melchizedek, thissacerdos in aeternum,isusedin2Enochas well as in many other traditions as the theological tool oflegitimization of alternative priestly authority (line).Fourth, it is possible that in the text we can see a specific attitudetoward the priestly authority (hierocracy) connected with the Temple inJerusalem.65The important supporting detail here is naming the placeof sacrificial duties of Enoch’s descendants as Achuzan.66This may alsobe the main reason for the replacement of official priestly line Noah-Shem to the line Nir-Melchizedek, as a legitimate background for thenew sectarian priestly authority.Fifth, the Melchizedek material of2Enochwas probably composedin a community which respected the authority of the Jewish lore (theopinion about Enoch’s ancestors as predecessors of Melchizedek). Thiscommunity might have had certain liturgical and theological differ-ences (sectarian biases) from the mainstream of Second Temple Juda-ism.65The question of the relationship between2Enochand the temple in Leontopolisremains open. A possible Alexandrian provenance ofSlavonic Enochcould give addi-tional support to this hypothesis. Cf. Fischer,Eschatologie und Jenseitserwartung im hellenis-tischen Diasporajudentum,40–41; M.
