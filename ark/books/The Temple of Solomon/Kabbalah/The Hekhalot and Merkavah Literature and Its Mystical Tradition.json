Its goals, religio-spiritual attitudes, practices, rev-elations, and exegetical perceptions demonstrate specific traits which,from a phenomenological perspective, can be characterized as mystical.THE HEKHALOT AND MERKAVAH LITERATUREThe anonymous corpus known as the Hekhalot and Merkavah litera-ture derives its name from two of its principal themes. The first themeinvolves descriptions of visionary heavenly ascents through the sevendivine palaces (Hebrew: Hekhalot). The second theme featuresmeditations and interpretations of the chariot vision (Hebrew:Merkavah).1 The collective title, “Hekhalot and Merkavah lit-erature,” may give the impression of a cohesive corpus of writingswith a specific homogeneous tradition or a consistent religious out-look. This literature, however, is not a unified body of work havingone spiritual approach. On the contrary, the Hekhalot and Merkavahliterature consists of several anonymous and enigmatic manuscripts,each of which includes various literary genres and diverse traditions.2The Hekhalot and Merkavah manuscripts are written in Hebrewand Aramaic with several borrowings from Greek.3 They came intoexistence over an extensive period of time. According to several schol-ars, they took shape in Palestine and Babylonia during the Mishnaicand Talmudic periods of the second and fifth centuries. Others datethis literature to the sixth and the eighth centuries, C.E., the late phaseof the Geonic period.4 These texts involved a long process of writing,editing, and redacting. They have not been preserved in their originaland complete form but are found instead as fragmented manuscriptsand literary units in later sources. A major body of the manuscriptshas been found in medieval Europe, among the writings of the HasideiAshkenaz movement. These manuscripts were edited by members ofthis school at the end of the twelfth and the beginning of the thir-teenth century C.E.5 Hekhalot and Merkavah material has been pre-served as well in the work of early Jewish philosophers from the tenthcentury and in polemic Karaite literature.6 Additional fragments, theauthorship of which is attributed to the ninth century, have been foundin the Cairo Genizah.7 Short segments of the Hekhalot and Merkavahtexts were also included in various Midrashim and in the Babylonianand Jerusalem Talmuds.8The Hekhalot and Merkavah literature is distinctively multifac-eted, presenting complex and sometimes contradictory notions of God,angels, and human beings.9Each manuscript, in fact, may be seen asan anthology of different traditions and subject matters. Cosmological"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The Herkhalot and Merkavah Literature9concepts, magical and theurgical traditions, accounts of visionaryascensions to the celestial world, descriptions of the angelic realm,rituals of adjurations, messianic contemplation, theosophical specu-lations concerning the nature of God, his appearance and the dimen-sions of his divine figure (shi‘ur komah,), are several of thecentral topics which the Hekhalot and Merkavah treatises introducesimultaneously.10The diversity of the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature as well asthe complexity of its texts make difficult any attempt to reach clear,solid conclusions regarding the scope of the corpus, the relationshipsamong its various parts, the time and social climate of its composition,and its dominant characteristics. Questions concerning the literaturehave therefore been disputed in the scholarly literature and manyspeculations have not been definitively proven.11 The following is abrief overview of the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature; its origins,literary traditions, and prevalent themes.HISTORICAL AND SOCIAL BACKGROUNDThe first attempts to anchor the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature ina specific Jewish tradition and to set the historical and chronologicaldate of its compilation were made in the nineteenth century. Severalscholars of that period considered texts of this literature as obscurelate manuscripts which stand outside the normative Judaism of lateantiquity and early Middle Ages. The historian H. H. Graez, for ex-ample, attributed the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature to the post-Talmudic and Midrashic periods. In Graetz’s opinion the literature’sexceptional and irrational themes, such as descriptions of angels,magical formulas, ascents to heaven, and descriptions of the body ofthe divine, could not correctly be seen as the product of legalisticrabbinical Judaism, but rather reflect the presence of Islamic influencefrom sources of the eighth and ninth centuries.12 Other scholars, incontrast, viewed the Hekhalot and Merkavah texts as authentic Jewishwritings from a much earlier date. M. Gaster, considered the Hekhalotand Merkavah literature as a remnant of an ancient school of thoughtdating from the Second Temple period. A. Jellinek regarded the manu-scripts as late homilies, which had not been included in the classicalcollections. He issued several of the treatises in his edition Bet ha-Midrash. S. A. Wertheimer shared a similar attitude and included sev-eral Hekhalot and Merkavah texts in his collection, Batei Midrashot, asdid S. Musajoff, who included Hekhalot and Merkavah texts in hisedition,Merkavah Shelemah.13 In the twenties, H. Odeberg published acritical edition of Sefer Hekhalot, also labeled by him as The Hebrew Bookof Enoch or 3 Enoch. As the title reflects, Odeberg considered the text"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"10Beholders of Divine Secretsto be a part of the ancient apocalyptic Enochic literature from the firstcenturiesB.C.E. and the first century C.E.14G. Scholem’s writings mark the beginning of contemporary aca-demic study of the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature. Scholem andseveral other scholars dated the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature toa much earlier time than had previously been suggested.15 The litera-ture, according to this view, was attributed to mainstream orthodoxRabbinic circles in the Tannaim period, around the turn of the firstcenturyC.E., and then developed in various ways during the followingsix or seven centuries.16 These conclusions have been challenged byseveral scholars. E. E. Urbach and D. J. Halperin have shown differ-ences between the Hekhalot and Merkavah tradition and that of Rab-binic Judaism, in which they have not found any trace of mysticalactivity but rather that of a homilitical midrashic study of Ezekiel’schariot.17 M. S. Cohen, P. S. Alexander, and M. D. Swartz have arguedthat different Hekhalot and Merkavah texts and literary units cannotbe dated to the first centuries C.E. Instead, they contend these textstook shape over several centuries in Palestine between the earlyAmoraic period and the post-Talmudic time in Babylonia.18Not only the chronological dating of the Hekhalot and Merkavahliterature remains unclear, but also the identity and the social-histori-cal background of its authors or compilers. No clear answers can bededuced from the literature itself.19 Well-known Tannaitic figures suchas Rabbi Ishmael, Rabbi Akiva, and Rabbi Nehunia ben Ha-Kanah arepresented in the various narratives as main speakers, yet the informa-tion they communicate often conflicts with documented historical data.Their descriptions relate primarily to an imaginary reality, and theirviews frequently contradict the accepted traditional norms of theMishnaic and Talmudic periods of the second and fifth centuries C.E.20Diverse theories have been suggested to determine the writers’identities. Members of a mystical school, originating in Palestine inTannaitic and Talmudic times, were considered by Scholem to be theearly authors of the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature, which laterextended to Babylonia and subsequently to Europe. P. Schäfer seesthis literature as an expression of an elite post-rabbinic group of schol-ars, originating in Babylonia. “People of the land,” including unedu-cated lower class rebels from a younger generation, were the writersof this literature, according to Halperin. This group challenged the oldrabbinic authorities, making theurgic use of the Sar Torah traditions ofthe Hekhalot and Merkavah in order to gain a higher social status andauthority. Associating the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature withmagical literature J. R. Davila considered professional scribes as thecomposers of the literature. Lacking formal rabbinic training and vener-able social status, they challenged the Rabbis with magic. In a recent"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The Herkhalot and Merkavah Literature11study he has identified the people behind the Hekhalot and Merkavahliterature as practitioners of ritual power, compared to shamans andshamans/healers. Swartz sees the authors as educated groups who lackedformal rabbinic training. These groups, placed between the elite and thecommon lower classes, were found in circles of synagogue functionar-ies, liturgical poets and professional scribes. R. Elior situates the Hekhalotand Merkavah literature in the context of priestly-angelic lore. She at-tributes it to members of priestly circles, whose concern was to preserveand reconstruct Temple traditions after its destruction as well as totransform the imperceptible divinity into a perceivable order.21The cultural-historical background of Hekhalot and Merkavah lit-erature has also been studied from various angles. As scholars havedemonstrated, the literature shares many characteristics with severalmajor religious movements which flourished in the same cultural cli-mate both within Judaism and outside of it. Similarities have beendrawn on the level of the general structure of ideas and as well on thelevel of detailed literary motifs and themes. In addition to the connec-tion of this literature with the Talmudic and Midrashic literature,22interdependence between Hekhalot and Merkavah hymnology andJewish traditional prayers has been documented, and significant im-pact of priestly-angelic traditions from the First and Second Templeperiods on the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature has been demon-strated.23 The Hekhalot and Merkavah literature has also been linkedto several other traditions and texts from a similar cultural environ-ment. These include apocryphal and apocalyptic literature,24 theQumran texts,25 Gnostic traditions,26 and early Christian literature.27Connections between several Hekhalot and Merkavah traditions andvarious Jewish and Greco-Roman magical traditions of late antiquityhave been studied as well.28SCHOLARLY EDITIONS AND METHODOLOGICAL APPROACHESFrom the middle of the nineteenth century several Hekhalot andMerkavah manuscripts were published by Jellinek, Wertheimer, andMusajoff.29 In the twenties, the first critical edition of a Hekhalot andMerkavah manuscript, Sefer Hekhalot, was published by H. Odeberg,who also labeled it The Hebrew Book of Enoch or 3 Enoch.30 Criticaleditions of specific manuscripts and literary units were published laterby scholars such as P. S. Alexander, M. S. Cohen, R. Elior, I. Gruenwald,K. Hermann, and G. Scholem.31 In the late 1970’s P. Schäfer suggesteda different approach to the study of the manuscripts. Questioning theconvention of separating the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature intofixed, defined, and independent textual units and books, Schäfer andhis colleagues published a synoptic edition of the Hekhalot andMerkavah literature. This edition is composed of seven manuscripts"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"12Beholders of Divine Secretsfrom medieval European sources, presented in one sequence and di-vided into nine hundred and thirty orderly, consecutive paragraphs. Alater edition of the Hekhalot and Merkavah texts, also published bySchäfer, comprises twenty-three fragments from the Cairo Genizah. Pho-tographs of the texts, comments, explanations and references to otherrelated Hekhalot and Merkavah sources are also part of this edition.32In several discussions, Schäfer has promoted the historical-textualapproach to the study of the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature. Inthese, he has emphasized the greater importance of clarifying ques-tions regarding the relationships among the manuscripts and varioustextual units over the lesser importance of the study of their particularcharacteristics.33 Other scholars, in contrast, have suggested employ-ing an overall contextual-phenomenological perspective in order toexplore the unique attributes of the literature. This second approachtreats the literature as a corpus with a common spiritual outlook anda shared literary heritage, reflected in the various texts, despite obvi-ous differences and contradictions. Scholars have appropriately adoptedthematic, contextual, phenomenological, and historical approaches asfruitful methods for analyzing the manuscripts. These methods allowmajor conceptual themes and outlooks found in the literature to bedistinguished and assessed.34Among the various conceptual themes and phenomenological fea-tures of this literature, its mystical teachings, principles, and ideashave been the topic of much discussion in significant studies. Thisstudy, as well, focuses on the Hekhalot and Merkavah mystical tradi-tion. Recognizing mysticism as one of many notions of this multilay-ered literature, it seeks to explore its specific features. As anintroduction, it is thus pertinent to discuss two topics, the nature ofmystical literature in general, and of the Hekhalot and Merkavahmystical literature in particular.MYSTICISM IN THE HEKHALOT AND MERKAVAH LITERATURERecent scholarship presents two primary approaches to the studyof mysticism in the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature. On the onehand, several scholars claim that this literature contains records ofgenuine otherworldly experiences, preparatory techniques, and rev-elations, all seen as its mystical core. In Scholem’s opinion, forexample, the soul’s ascent to heaven and its attainment of God isthe dominant mystical concept of this literature. It reveals evidenceof ecstatic visionary experiences which later degenerated into magi-cal writings. I. Gruenwald likewise associates mysticism in this lit-erature exclusively with ascent traditions. J. Dan identifies three"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The Herkhalot and Merkavah Literature13types of mystical elements in the literature, among which the as-cent to the Merkavah is the most significant. In Elior ’s view, themystical aspects of this literature are represented by a new conceptof divinity as well as by the practice of ascent to heaven. K. E.Grözinger highlights the mystical ascent as well as mystical prepa-ratory techniques and stages.35On the other hand, some scholars assert that the Hekhalot andMerkavah literature includes merely literary constructions, which donot reveal authentic mystical experiences and practices. Urbach andHalperin, for instance, maintain this view, arguing that the ascent themeshould not be regarded as the primary aspect of this literature, whichreflects mostly literary developments. Schäfer argues that the litera-ture does not provide any indication of how the heavenly ascent wascarried out, or even if it was practiced at all. M. Himmelfarb assetsthat the literature includes stories to be repeated and not descriptionsof tenable experiences and rites.36This dichotomy between the experimental and the exegeticalaspects of the Hekhalot and Merkavah mystical tradition has beenchallenged recently in several studies. Alexander discusses the inter-dependency of these two aspects in any study of Hekhalot andMerkavah mysticism and asserts: “from early on in the movementboth ‘theoretical’ (i.e. exegetical) and ‘practical’ (i.e. experimental)approaches to the Merkabah were followed.”37 Rejecting any distinc-tion between the two E. R. Wolfson states: “Such a distinction is predi-cated on the ability to isolate phenomenologically an experienceseparated from its literal context—a questionable presumption, inas-much as all such experiences occur within a literary framework.38This approach parallels a prevalent view according to which theacademic access to mystical teachings, experiences, revelations, anddoctrines of any mystical school is available mainly through its lit-erary writings. Scholars have argued in support of this claim, main-taining that only the literary records give expression to mysticalnotions and enable students of mysticism to explore their meaning,thus, the analysis of mysticism is primarily textually based. S. T.Katz makes this observation very clearly, asserting that the key tounderstanding mystical phenomena in general is through analysis ofits literary evidence:There are no pure (i.e., unmediated) experiences. Neithermystical experience nor more ordinary forms of experiencegive any indication, or any grounds for believing, that theyare unmediated. That is to say all experience is processedthrough, organized by, and makes itself available to us inextremely complex epistemological ways.39"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"14Beholders of Divine SecretsSharing this perspective, scholars such as R. M. Gimello, P. Moore, andC. A. Keller assert that mystical writings form the only data for anyanalysis of mysticism. The study of mysticism appears, therefore, to beprimarily literary, philological, and exegetical.40 In his investigation ofmystical phenomena, B. McGinn’s perception accords with this per-spective: “The only thing directly available to the historian or histori-cal theologian is the evidence, largely in the form of written records.”41This approach to the study of mysticism seems to be particu-larly valid in the case of the Hekhalot and Merkavah mystical tra-dition. In its enigmatic and fractured collection of literary texts, wedo not find records of pure, unmediated mystical experiences orrevelations, presented as verified, firsthand, personal testimony.Instead, the many Hekhalot and Merkavah passages provide a richtapestry of theoretical literary descriptions and of first, second, orthird hand pseudepigraphical testimonies of visionary experiencesand revelations, which demonstrate certain mystical characteristics.These writings may present records of authentic experiences trans-lated into words. They may also be bound up with accepted tradi-tional norms, or based on literary conventions shared by a specificgroup.42 Since the literary texts, in their present form, constitute ouronly link to Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism of late antiquity,the pure nature of authentic mystical experiences, their validity, orthe accuracy and correctness of reported mystical claims are topicswhich stand beyond the scope of our investigation. Instead, througha careful analysis of the written data, substantial insights into thenature of the Hekhalot and Merkavah mystical tradition and itsspecial traits can be achieved.43WHAT IS MEANT BY MYSTICISMAs we approach Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism through a studyof its literature, we need to discern the term mysticism, as well as tospecify which parts of the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature exhibitnotions and outlooks which could be characterized as mystical. Themany studies of mysticism make clear that every examination of thiswide phenomenon defies any clear-cut attempt at its definition. Mys-ticism is a phenomenological concept, coined by Western scholars,which refers to various types of teachings, experiences, and goals ofvaried spiritual trends.44 Deeply influenced by the perspectives, back-grounds, and interests of its scholars, the definitions and classificationsof mysticism are numerous and diverse. Rather than distinguishingwhat mysticism is, this study focuses on several of its characteristicqualities, denoted from a phenomenological perspective, which are ofparticular interest for this investigation of the Hekhalot and Merkavah"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The Herkhalot and Merkavah Literature15tradition. Beneficial observations on these aspects are offered byMcGinn in his discussion of the heuristic nature of mysticism:When I speak of mysticism as involving an immediate con-sciousness of the presence of God, I am trying to highlighta central claim that appears in almost all mystical texts.Mystics continue to affirm that their mode of access to Godis radically different from that found in ordinary conscious-ness, even from the awareness of God gained through theusual religious activities.. . . As believers, they affirm thatGod does become present in these activities, but not in anydirect or immediate fashion. Mystical religious texts are thosethat witness to another form of divine presence, one thatcan, indeed, sometimes be attained within the context ofordinary religious observances, but which need not be. Whatdifferentiates it from another form of religious conscious-ness is its presentation as both subjectively and objectivelymore direct, even at times as immediate.45McGinn’s observation highlights several distinctive principles,which are significant for the study of Hekhalot and Merkavah mysti-cism. This observation expands the notion of mysticism, recognizingthat the unio mystica model is not its only characteristic feature, andthe principle of union with God does not embody its sole essence.Acknowledging alternative mystical models McGinn perceives a stateof an immediate consciousness of the presence of God as pivotal andfurther contends:. . . union is only one of the host of models, metaphors, orsymbols that mystics have employed in their accounts. Manyhave used it, but few have restricted themselves to it. Amongthe other major mystical categories are those of contempla-tion and the vision of God, deification . . . ecstasy. All of thesecan be conceived of as different but complementary ways ofpresenting the consciousness of direct presence.46Several additional conceptual and ideological traits are suggested byMcGinn’s observation presented above. References to specific conscious-ness of the presence of God demonstrate a claim that there is an alter-native realm of absolute divine entity, or ultimate reality, beyond thephenomenological world, which can be attained by human seekers.The mystical awareness is different from the awareness of God gainedthrough the usual religious activities and thus, the attainment ofthe divine, according to this view, often occurs outside the frame-work of established, traditional religious life. In his discussion ofthe nature of mysticism, Dan similarly observes: “There is an alter-native, nonsensual, and nonlogical way of achieving truth, the via"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"16Beholders of Divine Secretsmystica, which can lead the mystic . . . to embrace some aspects of thehidden truth.”47McGinn’s account also emphasizes the internal mental realm ofhuman consciousness, on which both the spiritual quest and its at-tained revelations occur. It highlights unique spiritual perception,awareness, and state of mind, radically different from that found inordinary states of being, that influence the ways in which the ultimatedivine reality is attained. J. E. Collins’ observation, presented from aphenomenological-psycological perspective, further elucidates thisaspect:One who subjects himself/herself to the discipline requiredof the mystic path, either by self effort or by submission toa spiritual guide, experience, as a result of his/her dedica-tion to this discipline, radical change within his/her con-sciousness. This transformation of consciousness may bemanifested in a new epistemology, cosmology, ontology,soteriology, and so forth.48The significance of such human’s states of consciousness, indirectly,also indicates another characteristic of the mystical phenomena—theprivate, introspective nature of the mystical process, which seems tobe, primarily, of personal concern. D. Merkur ’s view of mysticismadvances this aspect:What, in my opinion, finally distinguishes mystics from othertypes of religious ecstatic is their standing in society. Sha-mans, mediums, and prophets are public social functionar-ies who act on behalf of their coreligionists in contactingtheir gods or spirits. Coreligionists may perform similarpractices for personal or private reasons. Mystics tend toseek experiences of exclusively private concern. Private ori-entations may be achieved through religious experiences ofmany different type, mystical union is merely one example.In all cases, it is the inward turn, due to the impossibility ofpossessing public religious authority, that I think character-izes mysticism wherever it is found.Finally, McGinn’s observation denotes the significance of religious texts,through which mystical notions are conveyed. Recognizing literatureas a source in which mystical concepts are described, expressed, andcommunicated verbally, this assertion denies a previous, commonlyreceived view about the absolute nature of mystical ineffability. In asimilar vein C. A. Keller notes: “Mystical writings are . . . texts whichdiscuss the path towards realization of the ultimate knowledge . . . andwhich contain statements about the nature of such knowledge.”50"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The Herkhalot and Merkavah Literature17McGinn’s reference to religious texts also indicates, it seems, thesignificance of an exclusive religious perspective, from which experi-ences and revelations are decoded and presented in the textual sources.Spiritual awareness of other realities is thus related as a mystical con-sciousness of the presence of God. Merkur’s observation, directs atten-tion to the specific nature of mystical states of mind:Mystical experiences are religious uses of otherwise secularalternate states of consciousness—or more precisely, alter-nate psychic states. What makes an alternate state experi-ence a religious one is its personal or cultural valuation.51The subsequent chapters of this study examine in detail the intri-cate manner in which these notions, characterized as mystical, arepresented in the distinct context and terminology of the Hekhalot andMerkavah mysticism. The following discussion of this chapter, as anintroduction, briefly describes the presence of such notions in specificsources of the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature. It intends to demar-cate its mystical writings and to outline their prominent features.THE HEKHALOT AND MERKAVAH MYSTICAL LITERATURESeveral of the Hekhalot and Merkavah literary texts are regarded asforming the main mystical core of the literature: Hekhalot Rabbati (TheGreater Book of Hekhalot), Hekhalot Zutarti (The Lesser Book ofHekhalot ), Ma’aseh Merkavah (The Works of the Chariot ), Sefer Hekhalot(The Book of Hekhalot), also known as the Hebrew Book of Enoch or 3Enoch, the Shi’ur Komah texts (Measurements of the Divine Body),various fragments relating to Metatron known as Shivah Metatron andseveralGenizah fragments.52Descriptions in Hekhalot Rabbati present an account of RabbiIshmael’s journey to heaven in order to find out if the death decree often prominent Jewish sages was decided by God.53 Rabbi Nehunia benHa-Kanah’s ecstatic ascent is similarly recorded. The text also outlinesvarious stages of the visionary ascent, paradoxically designated in thetexts as the “descent to the Merkavah,” including its goals, techniques,and revelations.54 Depiction of the upper worlds, the divine chariot,and the angelic rituals are provided.Hekhalot Zutarti relates Rabbi Akiva’s ascent to the upper heavens,delineated in a version of the story of “four who entered the Pardes,”found also in the Tosefta, the Talmud, and the Midrash. Rabbi Akiva’saccomplishments are highlighted as he is compared to the other threesages who “entered the Pardes.”55 Their harsh fate illustrates indirectlythe risks of the journey as well as the ways in which to avoid them.Rabbi Akiva also describes his vision of ascending to heaven, and"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"18Beholders of Divine Secretsinstructs members of Merkavah group who wish to ascend. This liter-ary tradition also makes references to Moses, portrayed as an ancientmystic who ascended on high to behold God.56 The text also offersdetails concerning spiritual goals and specific methods and practicesdesigned, it seems, to influence the adept’s awareness and to induceecstasies. It narrates the stages of the visionary ecstatic journey, includ-ing its dangers and challenges. Divine revelations are also disclosed.57Ma’aseh Merkavah provides information concerning spiritual goals,techniques, visionary ascents to the chariot, and spiritual achieve-ments.58 It includes general descriptions, songs, hymns, and prayers,recited by the Merkavah seekers before God, as well as a few accountspresented as their personal testaments.Sefer Hekhalot, known as 3 Enoch or The Hebrew Book of Enoch, re-ports Rabbi Ishmael ‘s ascent to the highest seventh heaven and re-counts his encounter with the Prince of the Countenance, Metatron,who shows him the structure and secrets of the divine world. Theaccount details the personal experiences and spiritual transformationwhich Rabbi Ishmael undergoes before he enters the divine realm. Thestory of Enoch, son of Jared, the human being who was transformedinto the divine archangel Metatron, echoes Rabbi Ishmael’s account. Itoffers additional data concerning the voyage from the phenomeno-logical to the transcendent world, the final transformation at the endof the path, and the nature of divine revelations.59TheShi’ur Komah traditions consist largely of visions of the mani-fested, anthropomorphic image of God.60 They also incorporate subtleexegetical interpretations of these revelations, presented from a specificspiritual viewpoint as will be demonstrated. Finally, several Genizahfragments from Cairo add various details, mainly about the visionaryjourney and its entailed revelations.All these Hekhalot and Merkavah accounts present, in a distinc-tive language and vocabulary, several particular features, which reacha level of explicit literary formulation. These are closely related to themystical notions discussed above. The Hekhalot and Merkavah mys-tical accounts claim the existence of an alternative realm of ultimatereality which stands beyond the physical phenomenological world.Seen from a specific religious perspective, this sphere is classified interms such as the Heaven of Heavens, the King’s palaces, or God’sMerkavah (chariot). These traditions, likewise, acknowledge an innercontemplative process of attaining the absolute achieved by humanseekers. This experience is depicted as visionary contemplative jour-neys out of this world to celestial realms. The members of the Merkavahcircle undergo a series of mental inner stages, through which severalqualified individuals acquire a unique spiritual perception, awareness,"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The Herkhalot and Merkavah Literature19and consciousness. This state enables them to attain the divine realityin a personal direct manner, which seems to be of private concerns.They see God’s celestial palaces, behold the King at his beauty, andgaze at the Merkavah.As mentioned earlier, in these Hekhalot and Merkavah diverseliterary accounts, we find no consistent information regarding mysti-cal concepts. In none of the writings can we find an attempt to conveymystical ideas in a methodical fashion, or to introduce a coherent andsystematic mystical doctrine. On the contrary, complex references tovarious mystical teachings, practices, visions, revelations, and exegesisare present in the nonhomogeneous Hekhalot and Merkavah literarygenres. They are transcribed in multiple modes of expression andcomposed from diverse perspectives as records of inner experiencesand visions, as well as theoretical information, general descriptions,narratives, and instructions.We read reports revealed as the mystics’ testaments during theexperience.61 Likewise, the mystics’ later reflections of their experi-ences are recorded, as well as reports and explanations from a thirdperson’s perspective.62 Theoretical teachings or what seem to be nar-rations of exemplary mystical principles are also found in theHekhalot and Merkavah literature.63 Narratives, such as the “Pardesstory” or the “account of the ten martyrs,” also provide references tomystical concepts, as well as direct dialogues between teacher anddisciple, and general instructions, directed to the people who aspireto engage in specific spiritual quests.64 Poetic forms, expressiveprayers, exegetical interpretations of mystical visions are additionalliterary genres which manifest mystical concepts in the Hekhalotand Merkavah literature.65Both the variety of sources and the lack of consistency clearlychallenge attempts to draw precise and decisive conclusions regardingthe nature of Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism. It is important, how-ever, to note the advantages of such a broad and richly layered litera-ture. Consideration of the many-sided mystical literature of anytradition, followed by an analysis of its significant literary genres, cancontribute to a wide understanding of this specific mystical tradition.The broad range of significant literary texts, genres, and forms do notobscure the investigation. Rather, they reveal its many aspects, phases,and outlooks, and can be of great value for comprehending the com-plexity of any specific mystical tradition. In his discussion of mysticalliterature, Keller observes diverse literary genres which are often in-cluded in mystical sources. Often, according to Keller, these differentliterary categories do not present unbroken and direct accounts of thepure experience. Nevertheless, when seen holistically, they provide"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"20Beholders of Divine Secretsaccess to prominent aspects and characteristics of the specific mysticaltradition in which they were compiled.66The advantages of this approach in the study of the Hekhalot andMerkavah literature becomes evident. Its wide scope in structure, genre,and content, allows an extensive examination of the mystical tradition.It provides rich material from various sources and angles, which mani-fest many characteristics and parallel aspects. Furthermore, the breadthof this literature exhibits corresponding notions found in several of itsliterary accounts. These similar aspects, which occur in various com-posite texts and redactions, demonstrate the shared conceptual andspiritual heritage of Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism. It is meaning-ful to note that the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature was never grantedany official canonical rank. Nevertheless, common mystical notionsprevailed over long periods of time in its diverse textual components.The lasting nature of these ideas attest to the vitality, respected status,and continuity of the Hekhalot and Merkavah mystical tradition."}]
