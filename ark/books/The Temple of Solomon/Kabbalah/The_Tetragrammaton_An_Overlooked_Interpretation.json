Siegfried urges that the imperfect of the verb means that the event was yet future: qui successurus erat. Now, beyond a doubt, the phrase can mean this. \"To stand in one's place\" is good Hebrew for succeeding to his position or throne. And the imperfect would express the future from the point of the narra- tive. But, on the contrary, the Hebrew does not demand such interpretation. The crux of the matter is the reference in the suffix on T1n l. It is idle to invoke English usage and point out that \"the youth\" is the nearest ante- cedent. Nonetheless, such identification gives the one interpretation harmonious with the theme of the passage. The youth continued to stand in his own place, that is, remained poor and humble. It may be objected that Sieg- fried's interpretation is more in harmony with the tense of the verb; for \"continuing to stand\" we should expect a participle. Whatever force there may be in this is obviated by the fact that the imperfect is employed in this force by Koheleth (e.g., 3:13, 14, 15, 22). Verse 16 is relatively simple. There was no end of all the crowds at whose head the old king was enthroned; nonetheless, later genera- tions will give no thought to him. The passage, then, translates: 13 Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king who does not know enough to take advice, 14 even though he had come from prison to the throne, though, too, in his own kingdom he was born in poverty. 15 I saw all the living who move about busily under the sun, among them that youth, who continued in his own station in life- 16 there was no end of all the people: all whom he ruled; yet those who come later will never give him a happy thought. The passage is a logically coherent unit. The king had every advantage. He rose from the most menial circumstances to a throne where for long years he was ruler of seemingly endless crowds of people; he ruled the youth also. But the youth had nothing, as wealth and power are commonly appraised: he was poor, and he continued poor to the end. For this is precisely the author's comparison: wealth and power along with foolishness, as against wisdom along with nothing at all. And, he says, the latter is better! UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO THE TETRAGRAMMATON: AN OVERLOOKED INTERPRETATION WILLIAM A. IRWIN T HE problem of the tetragrammaton has been given renewed attention in recent months. In this Journal, III (1944), 1-8, Ray- mond A. Bowman advanced the view that the name is derived from a root meaning \"to speak\"; and in the Journal of Biblical Litera- ture, LVII, 269 ff., Julian Morgenstern ad- duces the usage of Second Isaiah to show that the word hi) was understood as a divine title. In this he was anticipated by Samuel I. Feigin, whose discussion in his Missitrei Heavar1 is such as to merit its being presented to readers who may not have seen it in the Hebrew original. He says (pp. 355 and 430-31): \"The name Yahweh is an imperfect from T'~i in the ancient form which had pathah with the preformative yod and waw as the second radical instead of the later yod. It appears also as the first person •'7 when God speaks on his own behalf [Exod. 3:14; Judg. 6:16; Hos. 1:9]. \"Perhaps, too, the participial form of the verb , ', namely Rj [H'I ], is used to signify Yahweh.2 Compare, 'I, I am He [HMD], and 1 New York: Hebrew Publication Society of Pales- tine and America, 1943. 2 [The form is a passive participle with stative meaning. As Jlg fl.\" is contracted to _ t •.- _ , so •.• (later '.1j) was contracted to I.iI and finally ri., probably under the influence of the third person pronoun. While expresses the existence of tempo- rary things (Eccles. 2:22) and ,•,~ (Exod. 9:3) ex- presses God's power acting temporarily, the passive form i$. expresses constant existence which is be- fitting as an epithet of God. For the passive participle expressing constant action compare 'ahazz hereb (Song of Songs 3:8), \"constant holders of sword\"; batuab This content downloaded from 144.122.201.150 on Thu, 11 Feb 2016 12:18:06 UTCAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"258 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES there is no god with me' (Deut. 32:39) with the verse in Isaiah, 'I, I am Yahweh, and be- side me there is no saviour' (Isa. 43:11). The word Hfii in Deuteronomy means Yahweh. The same meaning attaches to the verse, 'I, I am He [HUi] who wipes out your transgres- sions for my own sake, and your sins I will not remember' (Isa. 43:25), namely, 'I am Yah- weh.' So likewise, 'I, I am He [Hfip] who com- forts you' (Isa. 51:12), namely, 'I, Yahweh, comfort you.' Also in the verses, 'I, Yahweh, am the first, and with the last I am He [Hi'a]' (Isa. 41:4), 'I am He [HUi], and none can de- liver from my hand' (Isa. 43:13), 'And unto old age I am He [HU ], and unto gray hairs I will carry' (Isa. 46:4), 'I am He [Hui], I am the first, yea I am the last' (Isa. 48:12)-in all these verses one can interpret 'I am Yah- weh.' Also the verse, 'For my mouth, it [HUi] has commanded, and his spirit, it [Hai] has gathered them' (Isa. 34:16), which Professor David Yellin explains as an ellipsis for 'His mouth, it has commanded' (Hiqre Miqrd~ on Isaiah [1939], p. 36) is to be interpreted, 'For the mouth of Yahweh'; HiuA serves in place of Yahweh. \"Also some proper names which end in Hi are to be explained as compounded of the participle of M \", standing for Yahweh, and another element. At times Hui is shortened still further. Compare, for example, Abifh, son of Aaron, and Abiyahu or Abiyah, king of Ju- dah. Both are one, but in Abihc the name of God is expressed by the participle of •,, while in Abiyah the name of God appears in the regular form. The name is to be interpreted as 'Yahweh is my God.' So too, Elihfi (I Chron. 26:7; 27:18), ElihuD (Job 32:2, 5, 6; 34:1; 36:1; I Sam. 1:1; I Chron. 12:20), and Elijah [ Eliyah and DEliyahO]: the interpretation of both is 'Yahweh is my God.' \"The name Solomon, too, is to be explained as compounded of Shl6m and HfiD, 'Peace of Yahweh,' but the name of Yahweh is written as the participle Hui, which can be shortened to H'i, and, finally, waw falls out and only he with mappiq is left, from which at length the mappiq also falls out as if a pronominal suffix were before us. And, indeed, Nathan called Solomon by the name Jedidiah (II Sam. 12:25), for the two names have the same meaning, 'The peace of Yahweh' and 'Be- loved of Yahweh.' Compare the names Shele- miah and ShelemiahP, in which the tetragram- maton is preserved in shortened form. \"Sometimes the name is compounded of two divine names. The name D6ddwdhfi (II Chron. 20-37) is compounded of D6d and Hai, and even the waw connecting the two names is preserved. But in the name D6d6 (I Chron. 11:12, 26, etc.) not alone is the waw connect- ing the names lost but also the root Hi is con- tracted to 6, as at the beginning of names Yahui is reduced to Y6.3 \"The Dwdh, mentioned in the stela of Me- sha, the Drl of which Mesha carried into the city of Ataroth and dragged before Chemosh in Keriath (Inscription of Mesha, 11. 12-13), was, it seems, compounded of Dwd and an ab- breviation of the participle of ,',, signifying Yahweh. We have here a divine name com- pounded of Dwd and HUi, but each one appear- ing in its own right. Professor Albright in his latest book, Archaeology and the Religion of Israel (1942), explains Drl as a proper name, Uriel; Dwdh he explains as dodah with mappiq- her dod, namely of Ataroth (p. 218, n. 86). But he gives a completely new meaning to the word dwd; that it is 'chief.' Against this one may note that the noun does not appear with this meaning anywhere in Hebrew..... Accord- (Isa. 26:3), \"it is constantly trusting\"; has'&eddah (Pss. 137:8) \"the professional robber\"; 'a~qir wecdzib (Deut. 32:36) \"permanent ruler and helper.\" The use of intransitive verbs in passive participle to express stative meaning is common in the Mishnah. For another contraction of 1 compare .•, \"branding,\" from . (Isa. 3:24). For contraction of b compare . (Mesha Stone, 1. 12) for h•' \"gazing stock.\" For contraction of . compare n.\" for f•'n• \"friendship.\" For other examples of contraction of 1 compare Ir ,, \"swim,\" from sahw (Gesenius-Buhl, 16th ed., p. 781), -i \"pasture\" from ahw, which is still found in Aramaic ,7Tn (Onqelos Gen. 41:2, 18).

Montgomery, \"The Hebrew Divine Name and the Personal Pronoun he\" (JBL, LXIII [1944], 161-63). Professor MIontgomery adduces other examples where hWi stands for Yahweh.

Very instructive is the verse Jer. 5:12, where X1 h- , \"there is no Hu,\" is parallel to denying Yahweh.--S.I.F.] (Montgomery's article appeared since the above was written.-W. A. I.) THE ORIGIN OF E•LOH, \"GOD,\" IN HEBREW SAMUEL I. FEIGIN As is well known the name ':ldh, \"God,\" is ex- plained either as an enlargement of Dl or as derived from a special root Dlh.1 It seems to me that we have in Deloh a compound name of Wl, \"God,\" and \"ah a shortened form for 'ahyeh, \"I shall be,\" the designation of Yahweh in the first person (Exod. 3:14; Judg. 6:16; Hos. 1:9). As Yahweh the third person is related to •ehyeh, originally ahweh the first-person qal of the root hwy,2 also Dah abbreviation of Dahyeh in the first person is related to ydh shortened form of Yahweh in the third person.3 The Da which was lost in the combination is recom- pensated by lengthening the vowel 4, as the lost a: is recompensated by lengthening the preceding vowel in syllables ending with '. Thus bara' became bard, \"he created\"; ra D, \"head,\" became rdrim, \"heads,\" finally r6d; and ya mar, \"he will say,\" becomes *ydmar, finally y6mar, so also Dela h became >eldh. The form Deldh is preserved in Aramaic and in Hebrew becomes, as usual, 'el6h. In cunei- form both forms are preserved ilahi and iluha.' For such a combination of deities compare Dwdh,4 namely, Dawid + Hu.5 In the same region is found also Ishtar-Kemosh.\" It is in- teresting to note that in both cases the other element precedes the element of the national deity, Ishtar before Kemosh, Dawid before H IA = Yahweh. Moreover, both may have some connection with the deity of love, Ishtar being the well-known deity of love in Baby- lonia and the West, and Dawid, judging from the name ded, means love also. Whether Dwdh was regarded as a separate deity or was only a manifestation of Yahweh as god of fertility is hard to decide. The two elements of Del and Dah, of which the name Deldh = Del6h is compounded, may have been originally two special deities, Del being the deity of earth and Dah = Yahweh the deity of heaven and the national deity of the Hebrews in general and of Israelites in par- ticular.7 But Professor G. Cameron pointed out to me that 1l may have been a kind of de- terminative \"god\" in general and has no spe- cific designation as \"god of the earth.\" The singular lA6h, pronounced l6lah, is used in plural form mDlehim, originally \"gods,\" but later \"God\" in the singular. This inter- change between \"god\" and \"gods\" to desig- nate the same divinity was found also in the old period in ilAmurru, \"the god Amurru\" and iliAmurru (DINGIR.DINGIR.MAR.TU). Also, Bacal appears as Becalim, cAshtareth as cAshtdr6th, cAnath as cAndth6th, the manifestations of the deity in various places and in various func- tions.8 UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO 1 See Gesenius-Buhl, Hebrdisches und aramdisches Handworterbuch (16th ed.; 1915), p. 39. 2 See Missitrei Heavar, p. 355, and above, p. 257.
