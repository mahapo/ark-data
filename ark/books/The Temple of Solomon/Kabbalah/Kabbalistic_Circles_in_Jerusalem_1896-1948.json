While this phenomenon has indeed attracted substantial research attention in recent years, the literature has yet to take stock of the historical background behind these developments. First and foremost, the world of the late nine-teenth and early twentieth-century kabbalists still awaits a full accounting. The hagiography that has been crafted by the progeny and admirers of these figures consists of dozens of books that paint a romantic picture of a glorious past. More specifically, the beginning of the twentieth century is depicted as a kabbalah renaissance unequalled since the halcyon days of R. Isaac Luria (HaARI) in Safad. Surprising as it may be, that same period’s Hebrew and Yid-dish belle lettres and, under their influence, the scholarly literature give the impression that by the early 1900s, the kabbalah deteriorated to the brink of extinction. According to this Zionist narrative, the flame was barely being preserved by a handful of survivors – a sort of dying kabbalah elite. Perhaps the boldest brushstrokes of this portrait were reserved for the contemporaneous kabbalah circles in Jerusalem, as Zionist writers portrayed a great awakening, on the one hand, and a steep decline, on the other. The desire to understand this contradiction is one of the main catalysts behind the present book, which focuses on the growth of the city’s kabbalah seminaries from 1896 to 1948. An understanding of these institutions also opens a window onto various Jewish mystical streams throughout the rest of the Middle East and Eastern Europe, which still await comprehensive accounts of their own.During these same years, Jerusalem became a cynosure for a host of kabbal-ists from around the globe, largely owing to the establishment of new yeshi-vot that were entirely dedicated to studying and disseminating the concealed Torah. Some of these institutions even devised systematic approaches to and curriculums for learning this wisdom. Seminaries of this sort practically did not exist in other communities, where kabbalists tended to study alone or in diminutive groups, on the margins of synagogues, Talmudic study halls, and Hasidic courts. For instance, we do not find so much as a single kabbalah ye-shiva in Eastern Europe during this period. However, quite a few books on this topic were printed throughout the region, so that there was evidently a local readership. The various waves of aliyah ( Jewish immigration to Palestine) at the outset of the twentieth century included seasoned kabbalists who sought an umbrella organization that would provide both financial support and a group framework in which to study. Moreover, young Torah scholars that displayed"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Prefacex<UN>an interest in kabbalah and sought a nurturing environment to pursue this calling also turned to such institutions. Established in 1737, the renowned Beit El Yeshiva, which concentrated a small handful of experienced kabbalists, was no longer the only “game in town.”In 1896, Jerusalem’s kabbalah landscape began to diversify. A few institu-tions, most notably Rehovot haNahar and Sha’ar haShamayim, branched out of the aforementioned yeshiva or saw themselves as “the New Beit El,” while developing a unique character of their own. Among the resident scholars of these emergent seminaries were both Ashkenazim and Sephardim who en-ergetically advanced their institutions, formulated curriculums, coined tech-niques, printed kabbalah material, and reached out to the traditional Jewish public, both in Palestine and abroad. Most of Jerusalem’s yeshivot championed the Sharabian way (discussed at length further on), but also had regulars with different leanings, such as devotees of the Vilna Gaon’s approach to Jewish mysticism. Be that as it may, the RaShaSh’s way was presented as the only legitimate interpretation of Lurianic kabbalah – a consensus view that indeed spawned indignation and resistance. The majority of the kabbalists, though, adopted one of the offshoots of the Sharabian school of thought or integrated elements of this gospel into other traditions, which they had brought from their places of origin.In recent years, Menachem Kallus, Moshe Hallamish, Joseph Avivi, Pinchas Giller, and other researchers have expanded on the RaShaSh’s mysticism and theology. Moreover, they have presented his image against the backdrop of earlier kabbalah literature, analyzed tikkunim and kavanot, and conducted a typological comparison between Sharabian and other kabbalah streams that emerged in the nineteenth century. In fact, Giller’s monograph on the Beit El Yeshiva offers the most in-depth look at the RaShaSh’s thought and prayer intentions. Furthermore, he meticulously compares the Sharabian way with those of different Hasids and with the Vilna Gaon’s school of thought. That said, the literature has yet to describe the yeshivot themselves, their resident scholars, and wide-ranging enterprise from a broad historical context. Kabbal-istic Circles in Jerusalem comes to fill this void. Put differently, this book adds a historical-cultural dimension to the literature on the early twentieth-century kabbalah world. The events of the Holocaust, the subsequent waves of immi-gration, the major socio-political transformations that Jerusalem underwent in 1948, and the diversification of the local kabbalah scene constitute the logical borders of this work. From this point forward, the picture indeed changed in many respects.Apropos to its title, the book opens with a chapter on the kabbalah’s “ imagined decline” in the eyes of Zionist novelists, poets, and researchers. A special emphasis is placed on the nostalgic writing of Ariel Bension, the"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"xiPreface<UN> fiction of Haim Hazaz, and various accounts by Gershom Scholem, who began his research enterprise on Jewish mysticism during those same years. Chapter two begins with a quick survey of the RaShaSh’s way and the criticism of this approach’s exclusivity among kabbalah circles in Jerusalem. That said, the nub of this and the following chapter (2 and 3) is an exposition on the kabbalah seminaries in Jerusalem, particularly Beit El, Rehovot haNahar, and Sha’ar haShamayim. This account draws heavily on the abundance of material that was written by the habitués of these same institutions as well as an array of manuscripts that pertain to their activities: public notices, private correspon-dences, official letters, financial statements, and the dossiers of rabbinical em-issaries. In the process, the chapter discusses the relations between kabbalists from different ethnic backgrounds. The fourth chapter expands on the efforts of R. Shimon Zvi Horowitz, a founder of Sha’ar haShamayim, to find the Lost Tribes. This undertaking is strongly linked to the rabbi’s kabbalistic approach and his own vision of the emergent national redemption. Likewise, we unveil two harrowing epistles that Horowitz addressed to the Sons of Moses. In the hopes of advancing their exoteric goals, Jerusalem’s kabbalists turned to the printing press. This enterprise constitutes the topic of the fifth chapter, which focuses on two major collaborations: new and improved editions of HaARI’s works, which were predicated on manuscripts that the publishers happened to come across; and the first print version of the RaShaSh’s siddur. The latter stirred up a heated debate within the community under review. All the more so, it intensified the dynamic between revelation and concealment – a balance that was espoused by kabbalah insiders. For the most part, these publications catered to the initiated—both veteran and novice practitioners of the Jewish mysticism—in the Land of Israel. Within this context, we introduce several unknown kabbalists whose printing initiatives rendered them cultural agents. The sixth chapter assays the “policy” of the Jerusalem seminaries toward the greater public. Embracing the hoi polloi, the yeshivot’s resident scholars could no longer be viewed as an insular elite that strove to preserve the kabbalah’s esoteric nature. Instead, they exhorted traditional Jews to expose themselves to a deeper stratum of their religion and culture. To this end, kabbalists dis-seminated prayers that were compiled for “lay” audiences. Additionally, the general public was encouraged to perform a variety of Lurianic and Sharabian kabbalah rituals and to learn the Zohar. In the seventh and final chapter, we examine the immediate reaction to this outreach in Jewish belle lettres and the local daily press. The resistance to, parody of, and disagreement with Horowitz and his cohorts in these works attest to the fact that Maskilic elements were apprised of what was going on in Jerusalem’s kabbalah circles...."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Prefacexii<UN>No single library encompasses all the material that I consulted in researching Kabbalistic Circles in Jerusalem. That said, it would have been impossible to complete this project sans the treasures housed in the Gershom Scholem Col-lection at the Israel National Library in Jerusalem. I would like to thank the librarians of the “Scholem room” from the bottom of my heart for maintaining such a tranquil, productive atmosphere and for the unfettered access to each of those sources. Furthermore, important archival material was discovered in the National Library’s Manuscripts Department, the Central Zionist Archive in Jerusalem, the Israel State Archives in Jerusalem, and the Yeshiva University Archive in New York. I am indebted to the directors and staff at all these institutions for helping me find the relevant documents. Rare notices and manuscripts also turned up at other libraries in Israel and the United States as well as private collections, whose owners were gracious enough to place these items at my disposal. In this respect, the book’s thick bibliographical list, which nearly constitutes a full inventory of the Jerusalem kabbalah seminaries’ publi-cations and many other related manuscripts, promises to facilitate new studies in the field.This short preface cannot possibly hold the names of all those people who helped bring the Hebrew and expanded English version of Kabbalistic Circles in Jerusalem to fruition. That said, my long conversations with and sage advice from Prof. Daniel Abrams, Prof. Zeev Gries, and Prof. Boaz Huss left an indel-ible mark on this book. I am also indebted to the fine craftsmanship of the translator Avi Aronsky, who proved equal to the task of transforming obscure and flowery kabbalistic rhetoric into flowing and comprehensible passages. May this book constitute a stepping stone to further research on twentieth-century kabbalah, not least its expansion beyond the formidable borders of the Jewish faith. The removal of the old barriers—the irrevocable shift in the balance between revelation and concealment in favor of openness—has also had a decisive impact on how traditional Jews approach this wisdom, to the point where the history of kabbalah, as it was hitherto understood, is in the midst of a veritable metamorphosis."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, ���6 | doi �0.��63/97890043��649_00�<UN>chapter 1The Last Kabbalists Ariel Bension and the Imagined DeclineIn 1925, Ariel Bension (1880–1932), a staunch Zionist activist, came out with a small booklet titled Hilula (Anniversary of a Passing) – a quasi-introduction to a more comprehensive book. The latter, Sefer Rafael, was slated to be a biog-raphy of “the last kabbalist.” Or as the author put it, the book is about “the last Sephardic mystic-cum-hero of the moribund Sephardic Hasidism in the Beit El Yeshiva.”1 He was essentially describing the lifestyle of his father, R. Yehosh-ua Ben-Zion of Morocco (ob. 1897), who was among the habitué of that same, venerable kabbalistic seminary in Jerusalem.2 Needless to say, Beit El has been in the Jewish public’s consciousness since its halcyon days in the eighteenth century, under the leadership of Gedaliah Chayun (ob. 1750) and his successor Shalom Sharabi – none other than the RaShaSh (1720–1777). The yeshiva was best known for the “writs of allegiance” (or “contracts of unity”) that its kab-balists composed and for the depths of their asceticism and immersion into Lurianic kabbalah. Beit El disseminated redacted versions of HaARI’s writings and copied manuscripts of parts of a siddur bearing the RaShaSh’s kavvanot 1 Bension, Hilula. An earlier, German version of this work places less of an emphasis on the yeshiva’s decline; idem “Die Hochzeit des Todes,” 956–972; idem, Die Hochzeit des Todes. In the introduction to the latter, Richard Beer-Hofmann wrote: “Die Hochzeit des Todes soll nur Einleitung einem grösseren Werke, dem Buch Raphael sein, und Sie sagten mir, dass Sie darin versuchen, Wesen und Art einer kabbalistischen Gemeinschaft festzuhalten, die, unter Spaniolen in Jerusalemenstanden, Jahrhunderte wuchs und lebte, und nunmehe ihren Ende nahe ist.” Portions of the non-Hebrew edition remain in manuscript form to this day, along with various drafts by Bension on the Jewish mystical literature and its annals; see Grubel, Catalog, 4.

I was brought up surrounded by scholars who carried on daily discussions on the Zohar, and my father was the spiritual head of this group of learned Chassidm.” Also see the notes that Scholem added on the margins of his personal copy of Ariel Bension, The Zohar in Moslem and Christian Spain at the Gershom Scholem Library, Jerusalem."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"chapter 12<UN>(kabbalistic prayer intentions that where integrated into the traditional lit-urgy). The kabbalists of Beit El devoted themselves to these silent meditative prayers, which last for hours (a practice that Pinchas Giller expounds upon in his groundbreaking book on the Sharabian kabbalah).3In Sefer Rafael, Bension endeavored to describe the yeshiva and its lifestyle up to the early 1900s. That said, only the aforementioned introduction to the full-scale book came out during his lifetime. As evidenced from his correspon-dence, Gershom Scholem was quite familiar with the author and his books, and even kept in touch with his widow.4 In any event, attempts to locate the rest of Bension’s shelved work on the Beit El Yeshiva have come to naught.5The famed seminary is also discussed in a few of Bension’s other works, in Hebrew, Spanish, English, and German. All these works portray Beit El as an institution that had lost its ardor and is thus mired in a state of atrophy. Examples include a booklet on Sharabi, a short article on the yehsiva and its evolution, a piece in the Viennese journal Menorah revolving around a couple of the writer’s memories, and an appendix on the seminary in his comprehen-sive book about the Zohar.6 In all these publications, Bension waxed poetic about the yeshiva’s way of life and its past leaders, but the present did not merit a faithful representation. Of course, he had nothing positive to say on Beit El’s continued existence or any living kabbalists. At the end of one article, Bension gave a particularly far-fetched account:That same star, Beit El, which rose upon Sharabi’s arrival to Jerusalem, began to set at the end of the previous century and a period of internal disintegration commenced. The outer shell of Beit El was consumed over the years and the rot is crumbling those walls, which long ago were a stronghold of the sacred fire, which was borne hither from the mountains of the Galilee. The storms and rain completely destroyed the roof ’s dome, 3 There is a wide-ranging literature on the Beit El Yeshiva.

That said, he also believed that it was a theological system that was no longer relevant to the “New Jew” in the Land of Israel. For this reason, kabbalah is destined to “vanish.”8 Critique of the Decline TheoryAccording to a 1931 review of Bension’s Master Shalom Sharabi in the news-paper HaOlam, “this book, is the first attempt to present the life of Sephardic Hasidism in a new style and a modern lyrical-literary form, like that of Martin Buber with respect to Ashkenazic Hasidism.”9 R. Binyamin (the pseudonym of Yehoshua Radler Feldman) gushed that “With this precious book a gate has been opened for us to the world of mystery.” However, he also stressed that Master Shalom Sharabi is not “a historical research, but impressions and mem-ories possessing the dew of childhood and pure excitement.”10 In an obituary on Bension, R. Binyamin added that “It was my privilege in my capacity as the editor of Moznaim to publish one of your most beautiful articles in this 7 Bension, “Beth-El: Die Synagogue,” 11; idem, Shalom Sharabi, 49.8 For an in-depth look at Bension’s thoughts on cultural Zionism and his vision of the East in his own words, see Bension, “El Neviei haSheker,” 1; idem, “The Jewish Renaissance in Eretz Israel,” 5–6.

Bension himself mentioned the influence of Buber on his writings. In fact, he declared that Buber’s books on East European Hasidism led him back to the study of Jewish mysticism.

From Beit El you hailed, from the tribe of ‘intenters’ [mekhavvnim]. And you too were an ‘intenter’ your entire life, a dreamer-intenter, a poet- intenter, a laborer-intenter. And you labored not with the passions of rhetoric, which was repugnant to you, not with clamor; I’ll say it candidly, not with the ‘revealed’ in you, but with the ‘concealed’ in you, in the undertones of the eso-teric, the religious undertones in you.”11 What is more, foreign translations of Bension’s books and articles also received positive feedback, especially from the German reading audience.12As opposed to these adulatory pieces, Moshe David Gaon’s 1931 review of Hilula excoriates Bension for “the dissembled wonderment and the radical emotionalism” that “are alien to the spirit of Jerusalemite Sephardic Hasidism.” The reviewer was intimately familiar with the Beit El Yeshiva, as his father was a regular at the institution for several years. On the basis of this knowledge, Gaon described many of its figures in The Oriental Jews in the Land of Israel (1938).13 At any rate, he doubted whether Bension’s planned sequel would pro-vide a faithful account of Jerusalem’s kabbalists:For this reason [i.e., the author’s sentimentality] I will allow myself to be removed if the body of the forthcoming book will be able to be ac-cepted in the literature in a bond of trust, which depicts and establishes the image and lives of the Sephardic Hasids in Jerusalem. And there is no difference in my opinion, who is “the last hero,” the Sephardic mystic of the moribund Hasidism in the Beit El Yeshiva in Jerusalem, whose life will be described and illuminated in Sefer Rafael. Only it bears emphasis, for the sake of historical truth, that he was not the last and that Sephardic Hasidism is not dying as per the account of the distinguished writer; that 11 Idem, “Following the Loss of Bension,” 16.12 See, for example, the review of Eugen Hoeflich (Moshe Ya’akov Ben-Gavriel) on Die Hochzeit des Todes: idem, “Neue östliche literatur,” 32; idem. Tagebücher, 346; and Theman-lys, “The Beth El Kabbalist,” 22–24. Some reviewers compared Bension’s works to those of Dante and Novalis. In 1921–1922, Bension was interested in commissioning the well-known Jewish ethnologist, musicologist, and composer Abraham Zevi Idelsohn to com-pose “Oriental music” for a proposed film adaptation of Die Hochzeit des Todes – his book on the last kabbalist. See Bension, Letters to Idelson (ms); Cohen, “The Opera,” 130–131.13 According to Gaon, his father was a foreign emissary of Beit El; in this capacity, he was responsible for the yeshiva’s collections (i.e., charity boxes) overseas.

Moreover, he discusses the reception of the book’s German edition. In Gaon’s estimation, it was feted in the German press due to many odd Romantic inclinations in that country. However, in the Land of Israel, he claimed, this topic cannot be digested in such a manner:In place of the act in which Hasidism is revealed with all its flaws through the lens of reality and actuality – one must not ignore the deficiencies that are attributed to it, lest naïve people believe that this is the color of the standard that Rabbi Gedaliah Chayun, and Shalom Mizrachi Sharabi (the Sun) of blessed memory raised in their time, and under it [i.e., this misperception] their progeny and admirers will today be deceived and misconstrue it [the kabbalah].15Although Gaon believed that the kabbalists had regressed, he merely saw this as a passing phase. The intellectual then concluded his review with the following hopes:The Hasidic movement and the pathways of its development among the Sephardim in Jerusalem – still awaits its describer and appraiser. It is still too early to speak of “the last Sephardic mystic and of the dying Hasidism in Beit El in Jerusalem.” Unlike the Baal-Shem-Tov Ashkenaz-ic Hasidism, which is boisterous and mirthful, this mystical movement that abounds in tranquility and eternal suffering – awaits a craftsman, who will reveal the source of light that is concealed therein, and who will draw out something of its delightful virtues, not one who will, God forbid, place a heavy stone over its ruins, but will spread out before the Hebrew audience with great love and pity its radiance in the past and its diminished standing in the present. Even in times of decline we shall not tremble; it is a step down for the sake of ascending; the light and the shadow will stand out...

As such, they nourished early twentieth-century scholars, novelists, and even kabbalists who, for the most part, gleaned his myths about the RaShaSh.18 Reports of Decline and the Kabbalah-Socialism MythRiveting as they may be, Bension’s accounts of the kabbalists’ supposed fall from grace evidently attest to a heartfelt wish or the Romantic proclivities of an author who was reared in and subsequently distanced himself from their world. In any event, a similar picture of the Beit El Yeshiva emerges from the period’s Hebrew and Yiddish literature and even from its scholarly writing, to the point where the Jerusalem institution became a symbol of “the sinking kabbalah.”19 Descriptions of living kabbalists or other seminaries were es-chewed in favor of that same comforting picture of Beit El’s dissipation and the consequent birth or rejuvenation of something else. Even an objective historian like Eliezer Raphael Malachi, who grew up in and was intimately familiar with 17 Gaon, Oriental Jews, vol. 1, 138–143; idem, “The Holy Community,” 117–120, 236–241; idem, The Sages of Jerusalem, 14–18. A substantial amount of the material that Gaon collected on Jerusalem’s kabbalah seminaries, including original documents, have been preserved in his personal archive; see Gaon, Notes and Documents on the Annals of the Kabbalistic Yeshivot in Jerusalem (ms). While Gaon was working on Oriental Jews, the kabbalist Ova-dia Hedaya sent him material on Beit El; Hedaya, Two letters to Gaon on the Sages of the Beit El (ms).18 See, for example, the generous use of Bension’s observations in the literature: Scholem, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism, 328–329, 422; Themanlys, The History of Beit El (ms); idem, “Bethel Foyer du Hassidisme Sefardi,” xxii-xxiii; Heschel, “Rabbi Gershon Kutover,” 52; idem, The Circle of the Baal Shem Tov, 84; and the reprinting of several pages in Jacobs, Jewish Mystical Testimonies, 156–161; idem, “The Uplifting of Sparks,” 112–113; Hoffman, The Kabbalah Reader, 104–107. The kabbalist Jacob S. Kassin also drew on one of Bension’s books for his own account of the RaShaSh; Kassin, Sefer Pri Eṣ haGan, 7–15.19 Among the fanciful accounts of Beit El’s demise are Frumkin, Toldot Ḥakhmei Yerusha-layim, vol. 3, 46–56, 107–121; Freiman, Sefer haZikharon haYerushalmi, 10, 50, 81."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"7The Last Kabbalists<UN>turn-of-the-century Jerusalem, wrote in 1931 that Beit El’s decline began back in the 1870s. Moreover, he described the head of the seminary, Yedidyah Rapha-el Chai Abulafia (the YaREh), as “the last of the kabbalists’ lions and with his death [in 1869] the candle, which was kindled by Rabi Gedaliah Chayun, began to wither until it completely expired.” Malachi also contended that Abulafia vehemently opposed the opening of modern Jewish schools, namely those in-tegrating general and religious studies, in Jerusalem, but “history avenged him.” Abulafia’s grandson, Nissim Behar, “established the first standardized school in Jerusalem,” thereby laying “the foundation for Hebrew education, from whose roots we are imbibing to this very day.”20 Succinctly put, besides offering an account of destruction, the researcher claimed that a profoundly different enterprise had sprung forth from these ashes. Like all his contemporaries, Malachi failed to describe the living kabbalists who indeed perpetuated the allegedly wilting traditions of Sharabi and his ilk; and the same can be said for all the researcher’s contemporaries.21A similar fate was shared by the period’s Hasids. Evocative descriptions of Hasidism’s atrophy and decline were penned by those same writers who lauded the Hasidic literature and its resplendent past, including those who 20 Malachi, “Nissim Behar,” 158–160. Behar discussed his efforts on behalf of “standardized education” in a newspaper article; Nissim Behar, “Paris,” 364–367.21 Malachi also brought up this topic in 1928; idem, Mekubalim in Eretz Yisroel, Introduction: “This work interested me from as far back as my youth. When I was a small boy, before leaving Jerusalem, I would frequently visit the seminaries in which they studied kabbalah, a place where ‘the last Mohicans’ of the kabbalah world would sit on low stools and learn the Zohar and other kabbalah books in a sad tune. I would sit for hours on end in the yeshiva of someone that recently passed away, the sage Isaac Gagin. Out of compulsion, I would leaf through the dusty old books, and I would listen to the deeds and myths that Gagin would tell me about Shalom Sharabi and the other kabbalists from the Beit El Ye-shiva.” The work ends with R. Hayyim Vital. The author represented the so-called “end” of those mystics, or the description of their remnants, exclusively through the story of Beit El, as he refrained from mentioning the other kabbalistic seminaries in Jerusalem. In this work, Malachi also touches on the RaShaSh (ibid, 20): “Rabbi Shalom Sharabi was the last of the great kabbalists. He was the true restorer of past glory. He was the one that rekindled the light of the kabbalah. A light that burns to this very day. A small center of Beit El exists to this very day in Jerusalem.” A planned sequel to Mekubalim in Eretz Yis-roel never came to fruition. At any rate, the “first volume” merited positive reviews in the press; Yekutiel, “Kabbalists,” 584. Malachi did eventually devote an article to his contem-porary Jewish kabbalists. Among the featured figures in this piece were the Jerusalemites Shimon Zvi Horowitz, Menahem Menkhin Halperin, and Rahamim ben David Shrem. See Malachi, “R. Shimon Zvi Horowitz,” 330–331."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"chapter 18<UN>spurred on a renewed interest in this corpus, albeit in the new Romantic spirit of the time.22These same, Zionist writers raised the banner of the “writs of allegiance,” which had epitomized the fellowship between Beit El’s kabbalists. Most of these compacts were later published on various stages between the late nine-teenth and early twentieth century as part of the efforts to construct a model for the idea of the emergent Land-of-Israel communes. All that the authors had to say about living kabbalists was that they were “final remnants” or a minor phenomenon unworthy of serious attention.23 A case in point is Alexander Zis-kind Rabinowitz’s article “The Commune among the Kabbalists of Jerusalem” from 1923. Besides providing the text of one of the said compacts, Rabinowitz argued that “The commune, qua idea, was discovered among the kabbalists of Eretz Yisrael 166 years ago. The kabbalah, which strives for absolute unity and equality, is what paved the way for the rise of the commune.”24 Thereafter, other writers followed Rabinowitz’s lead, such as Eliezer Rivlin (in his notes to Aryeh Leib Frumkin’s book), and Eliyahu Tsherikover, who stressed the social-ist dimension of the writs.25The observer who put the lie to the analogy between the writs of allegiance and the modern communes in Palestine was Shaul Hana Kook (the brother of Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook – the Ashkenazic chief rabbi of Mandatory Palestine). “In our days,” he wrote, “before our eyes, a” completely baseless “myth has taken form as to the commune of the RaShaSh.”26 Moreover, Kook identified Rabinowitz as the one who had disseminated the misinformation 22 For more on this phenomenon, see Ross, Beloved-Despised Tradition; Meir, Rabbi Nahman of Bratslav, 10–39.23 The writs of allegiance have merited considerable attention.

Benayahu provides the exact wording of these compacts. On the assorted versions and content of these documents, see Kook, “On the Association of Jerusalem’s Kabbalists,” 84–85.

Moreover, similar accounts were destined to rear up, such as the following article in an organ of the kibbutz movement: Nini, “The Writs of Allegiance,” 12–13.26 Kook, “The Myth surrounding the Commune in Jerusalem Kabbalistic Circles,” 128–130; idem, “The Annals of the Kabbalist Society in Jerusalem,” 134–137; idem, “The First Writ of Allegiance of the Jerusalem Kabbalists,” 221–225; idem, Studies, vol. 2, 153–159."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"9The Last Kabbalists<UN>that the kabbalists shared their property. Kook concluded that this theory is a “flight of fancy.” However, at the time, the myth was stronger than reality. Gershom Scholem and Coeval KabbalistsIn the same 1943 edition of the journal Moznaim as an article by Bension on the Beit El Yeshiva, one S. Adaya contributed a short story titled Nehora Kadisha (Holy Light), which she dedicated to Gershom Scholem. The work describes a kabbalist in Jerusalem’s Old City who manages to calculate the end of the days. However, the protagonist winds up taking the secret with him to the grave. When other kabbalists realize what had happened, they set out to salvage his findings; but they are scalded in the process and ultimately abandon the quest. Over the course of the story, the gap between the old-school mystic and the next generation comes into focus.27 Nehora Kadisha not only reflected the pre-vailing attitude toward the putative decline of the kabbalah circles, but also the outlooks concerning the secrets that they harbored – esoteric knowledge that kabbalists, researchers, and novelists sought to embrace or debunk.As adduced from his writings, Scholem’s approach is nearly the same as Bension’s and the rest of the decline camp, as he too employed terms and de-scriptions like “the remnants,” “the last of the kabbalists,” and “the survivors, the surviving residue who watch over the dim flame of the kabbalah and the gospel of kavvanot in a few of Jerusalem’s yeshivot.”28 The scholar primarily referred to Beit El’s habitués, some of whom he met during his first years in Jerusalem.29 On this particular topic, his accounts were predicated on and expansively cit-ed from Bension’s work.30 The crux of Scholem’s theory was that in response to the Sabbatai Zvi affair, Sharabi’s acolytes had basically withdrawn from public life. In Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism, he claimed that the fellowship of Beit El decided to completely “forego” the creation of “a mass movement, in order to avoid a repetition of the disastrous consequences which had fol-lowed the most recent of these attempts.” As a group, these kabbalists “entirely renounced the more popular aspects of Lurianism [Lurianic mysticism] and 27 Adaya, “Nehora Kadisha,” 160–164. This same tension is described in a short story by Naftali Ben Menachem (who subsequently became a kabbalah scholar); idem, “The Kabbailst,” 3.28 Scholem, Devarim b’Go, 225.29 Boaz Huss elaborated on the genesis of this approach in several articles, including idem, “Ask No Questions,” 141–158; idem, “Authorized Guardians,” 104–126.30 E.g., Scholem, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism, 328–329, 422."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"chapter 110<UN>tried to lead the kabbalah back from the market place to the solitude of the mystic’s semi-monastic cell.” Moreover, Scholem viewed Sharabi as “the classic representative of this tendency”31 In this context, he described the contem-poraneous Beit El Yeshiva as “a forlorn spot in the Old City of Jerusalem.” That said, Scholem noticed that the institution continued to resonate in the public consciousness:Even today as I write these lines, men who are thoroughly “modern” in their thought may draw inspiration from contemplating what Jewish prayer can be in its sublimest form. For here the emphasis was again, and more than ever, laid on the practice of mystical prayer, the mystical con-templation of the select. “Beth El,” says Ariel Bension, the son of one of its members, “was a community resolved to live in unity and sanctity. Of those who thought to enter its portals it demanded the attainment of the scholar and the self-abnegation of the ascetic. Thus it missed the masses.” [...] Kabbalism becomes at the end of its way what it was at the begin-ning; a genuine esoterism. A kind of mystery-religion which tries to keep profanum vulgus at arm’s length. Among the writings of the Sephardic Kabbalists of this school, which has exercised a considerable influence on Oriental Jewry, it would be difficult to find a single one capable of being understood by the laity.32These observations notwithstanding, Scholem refrained from expanding on the multifaceted world of Sharabi’s followers. For instance, he made no men-tion of the various kabbalistic practices that they sought to promote as general religious duties for the community at large. On the face of things, Scholem described these mystics as aloof – shut off and secluded – and as individuals guarding the palace gates. He preferred the topic of East European Hasidism. At the time of its founding, he averred (in the spirit of Martin Buber), Hasidism was a vital movement that turned to the masses and transformed the kabbal-ah in various ways. As demonstrated in the next few chapters, though, these kabbalists straddled the fence between the revealed and the concealed and between populism and seclusion.In his memoirs, Scholem reflected on the yeshivot under review in a similar fashion. However, the discussion is rather terse and is nestled into the author’s description of his relentless hunt for Hasidic and kabbalah books:31 Ibid, 328.32 Ibid, 328–329."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"11The Last Kabbalists<UN>In Jerusalem, the last of the kabbalists of Beit El and other yeshivot like Sha’ar haShamayim and Porat Yosef were still active. Beit El was a cen-ter with an uninterrupted tradition of approximately two hundred years entirely devoted to immersion into Lurianic kabbalah and praying with kavvanot – an introspective (meditative) practice that was designed down to the last detail by R. Shalom Sharabi, the rosh yeshiva [seminary head] in the mid-eighteenth century. All the mekhavvnim followed in his footsteps. However, they did not recognize any stream outside of Luri-anic kabbalah, and every other form of kabbalah was neither genuine in their eyes nor worthy of serious study. As such, they had no interest whatsoever in books of kabbalah that did not accord with their view, and certainly not in works of Hasidic literature that they deemed a sort of kabbalah for the masses that was incompatible with their spirit.33Scholem’s research enterprise on Jewish mysticism coincided with a major re-surgence of its use in the Land of Israel and an influx of Sharabian kabbalists to Jerusalem. Against this backdrop, it comes as no surprise that he tried to distinguish between kabbalah scholars and the contemporary kabbalists. This vantage point comes across in an observation that Scholem made in a 1935 article titled “Kabbalah at The Hebrew University:”The kabbalist places himself within the long chain of the kabbalah’s tradition and views it from the inside. He lives in the world of kabbalah and forgoes broaching questions that scientific-minded people must raise. And if I say that he dwells in this world, it means that he is living in that same curtailed part in adherence to that same approach that still exists and is persevering in recent generations too. He does not see the expansion in methods or the many and manifold variations of kabbalistic thought and he does not see the progression of things over the genera-tions. [...] The last remnants of Lurianic kabbalists are still to be found in several yeshivot in Eretz Yisrael. These men are the last sentries at the palace door [i.e., authorized guardians]; from all the spiritual richness 33 Scholem, MiBerlin leYerushalayim, 206 (also see the shorter and heavily revised versions of this book in English and German; idem, From Berlin to Jerusalem, 169–170). Thereupon, Scholem admitted that the kabbalists’ horizons were broader than he had originally thought: “Only years later did I discover that a few of them also furtively occupied them-selves with the writings of Abraham Abulafia and copied them for themselves, but these books did not come out in print.” These activities at the Beit El Yeshiva will be discussed in the next chapter; ibid (missing in the English version)."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"chapter 112<UN>and refinement in the kabbalah world, all that remains for them is that same psychological education and system of mystical training that goes by the name of “praying with intention.” They live in the world of “inten-tion” [kavvana] and it is this method that they still teach; however, in all that concerns researching the entire range and depth of the kabbalah world there is no savior amongst them.34Scholem made similar comments in an English article from around 1938, titled “The Research of the Kabbalah at The Hebrew University:”In Jerusalem there are, at the present day, certain Yeshivas where groups of Kabbalists can be found who are maintaining the chain of Kabbalist tradition, and safeguarding its spiritual heritage and treasures. Kabbalists in the Diaspora regard them as those most authorized and best fitted to expound their lore. But the great majority of these latter-day kabbalists have completely forgotten the historic elements of their movement. The only kabbalists [sic] system among them which still maintains a measure of vitality is that of Rabbi Shalom Sharabi of Yemen, who lived in Jerusa-lem during the Eighteenth Century. In this tradition the lore of the Kab-balists is based on the sacred forces of prayer, on prayer with devotions [kavvanot], absorption, and assimilation in the mysteries of Divinity and worship, down to details so minute as to border on excess. There are still, at the present day, followers of this lore of mystical devotion by means of prayer, who live their lives in accordance with it during long years of study and preparation. To them all other branches and sections of Kab-balistic lore have become closed and obsolete except insofar as they serve for the theoretical confirmation of the principles of devotion and medi-tation. If ever they do trouble to read one of the earlier Kabbalist’s works, it is only in order to discover therein the secrets of their own system.35Scholem occasionally depicted the “Sharabian kabbalists” as a monolithic group. Put differently, they all marched to the beat of the same drum and were devoid of true innovation. Therefore, he did not publically express his views on their sundry books, even though he was quite familiar with them. More spe-cifically, the vast majority of these works reached Scholem’s personal library, and he even added comments on their margins. In an interview almost forty 34 Scholem, “HaKabbalah baUniversita haIvrit,” 14.35 Scholem, “The Research of the Kabbalah at The Hebrew University,” 9–10 (also see the Hebrew version; idem, “Hakirat haKabbalah baUniversita haIvrit,” 9)."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"13The Last Kabbalists<UN>years later, Scholem described the regression of the Jerusalem kabbalah center vis-à-vis previous generations: “What remains from the kabbalah in Beit El was something akin to yoga. I got the impression that I was dealing with a group of people practicing yoga according to a Jewish formula in the Land of Israel.”36 This contention resurfaces in a number of his later works, some of which also portrayed “the last survivor.” The common denominator between all these accounts was their brevity and lack of detail.Scholem reprised the theme of the kabbalah world’s “decline,” especially with respect to the Beit El Yeshiva, in “On the Possibility of Jewish Mysticism in our Time.” He claimed that there is no “original mysticism” in his genera-tion, save for a couple of exceptional phenomena.37 Likewise, a “renaissance” was not to be found in Jerusalem’s kabbalah seminaries or in the practices of Sharabian mystics.38 Rehashing earlier insights, Scholem noted that the writing of these same figures had transformed the kabbalah back into an esoteric field that is closed off to outsiders and difficult to penetrate. “Had I behaved like an Orthodox person,” Scholem contended, he would have acquired more knowl-edge about their enterprise.39 As evidenced from his correspondence with one Samuel L. Lewis in 1948, Scholem displayed little interest in fathoming these realms. His Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism had sparked a fire in Lewis’ heart. Owing to the book’s descriptions of the Jerusalem kabbalists, the Jewish Sufi from California wanted to meet these same “survivors” for the sake of a spiri-tual unification. Scholem’s response to the new-age leader’s letter is compel-ling in several respects. Laced with derision, it nevertheless touches on the author’s link to, or more precisely, detachment from Jerusalem’s kabbalists. “I must confess,” Scholem wrote, “that I have never been initiated into any eso-teric circle, and in interpreting Kabbalah and Jewish mysticism at all, I have been relying on my own intuition and that measure of understanding which a careful analysis of difficult texts on a philological basis may afford.”40Scholem indeed encountered quite a few kabbalists during his years in Jerusalem. These meetings are documented by an assortment of papers in his literary estate, notes written on the margins of books in his personal library, 36 Scholem, Devarim b’Go, 44.37 Ibid, 71–83; Scholem, On the Possibility, 6–19.

Among the Jewish mystics that he spoke with are R. Gershon Chaim Vilner, who attended Beit El and the Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva (Vilner agreed to teach his interlocutor kabbalah under one condition: Keine Fragen zu stellen – no questions allowed);41 R. Makhluf Amsalem, an alchemist and kabbalist who he visited together with Simcha Assaf;42 R. Eliyahu Avraham Mizrachi Dahuki, a mystic from Kurdistan who was apparently interested in teaching him practi-cal kabbalah;43 a face-to-face encounter with R. Yehuda Fetayah towards the end of the rabbi’s life;44 and he had a conversation about Abraham Abulafia with R. David Cohen the “Nazirite.” Upon first hearing about the latter, Scholem was reportedly astonished: “I thought that the kabbalists had come to an end, yet here in Jerusalem wanders a living kabbalist and produces words of kabbal-ah in this day and age – a living kabbalist!”45 In any event, Scholem concluded his own impressions of Cohen thus: “All my efforts to get to the bottom of his thought came to naught.”46 In 1938, Scholem received an invitation to Rehovot haNahar Yeshiva (discussed at length below) from R. Eliyahu Dweck-HaKohen, the head of the seminary. “It is our privilege,” Dweck-HaKohen wrote, “to invite you to visit our institution, for we have heard that his honor is interested in the wisdom of the kabbalah; on our premises, he will find a library rich in this knowledge.”47 There are doubts as to whether Scholem took advantage of this 41 Scholem, Zur Kabbala und ihrer Symbolik, 117; idem, Devarim b’Go, 43–45. See Huss, “Ask No Questions,” 141, 155. Sha’ar haShamayim’s records suggest that Vilner was among the yeshiva’s regulars; Sha’ar haShamayim, Account Books (ms), 1908–1922.42 Scholem refers to this encounter on the margins of his personal copy of Tapukhei Zahav B’maskiot Kesef (1926–7). Also see Fenton, “Rabbi Makhluf Amsalem,” 92–123.43 Scholem, Notes on Contemporary Kabbalists (ms). Mizrachi copied various manuscripts, including the book of magic Harvah deMoshe. In 1931, he printed Refuah veHayyim meY-erushalyim (Medicine and Life from Jerusalem), which includes remedies and amulets from various manuscripts.44 Scholem makes note of this in his personal copy of Fetayah, Sefer Beit Leḥem Yehuda (vol. 1, 1936). This book is currently in the possession of The Hebrew University’s Bloomfield Library.45 This anecdote was related by Zalman Shazar, the third president of Israel. See Cohen (haNazir), Kol haNevua, page 9 of the appendix “Praise Be the Voice of the Prophecy.” This section consists of adulatory speeches about the said book that were given at the President’s Residence in the summer of 1970.46 Scholem, MiBerlin leYerushalayim, 204.

Despite these encounters and the wide-ranging literature that these figures penned, Scholem was not motivated to write about what was transpiring in their circles. That said, he did make an effort to secure all of their publications for his collection.In light of the above, Scholem’s attitude towards these kabbalists and every other manifestation of Jewish mysticism in early twentieth-century Palestine must be understood within the broad context of the prevailing mindset at the time among Jewish novelists, especially in the Yishuv (the Jewish settlement in the Land of Israel). These intellectuals were wont to understate the value of their contemporaneous kabbalists’ enterprise or to ignore it altogether. At one and the same time, though, these writers, as well as academic scholars, burrowed through the Jewish mystical literature in the hopes of igniting other sparks with which to construct a new literary, research, and/or interpretive edifice. Haim Hazaz’s Vision of DeclineThe sources under review not only depict a world that is slowly ebbing or has already vanished, but were part of a trend to assert that the kabbalah’s decline in the Land of Israel was a fait accompli. Historic events, foremost among them the ingathering of the exiles in the Zionist spirit, had sealed the fate of Jewish mysticism. This position was radically evinced in a handful of belletristic works by Haim Hazaz, an East European Jewish writer who immigrated to Palestine in 1931. During these years, there were also novelists, like Israel Zarchi and Ezra Hamenahem, who had a different take of the local kabbalah scene, casting some of its practitioners in a positive light. However, these viewpoints were exceptions to the rule. Over the next few pages, we will examine several of Hazaz’s works that comport with the “decline theory.”In the novel Ya’ish (1947–1952), Hazaz portrayed a Yemenite kabbalist who undergoes a metamorphosis amid a series of trials and tribulations.48 Given the background, it is only natural for the reader to conjure up images of other mystics, not least Shalom Sharabi. While in Yemen, the protagonist, Ya’ish, is occupied with mystical practices, such as yiḥudim and kavvanot. He merits dreams, visions, and ascents of the soul and regularly merges with the upper 48 Hazaz, Ya’ish, parts 1–4. He published the first chapters of this novel under the pseud-onym Zecharya Uzali (a moniker for a native of Sana’a), before issuing a revised edition, under his own name, circa 1968. For a disquisition on Hazaz and his major works, see Bargad, Ideas in Fiction; Kressel, Encyclopedia of Modern Hebrew Literature, vol. 1, 595–597."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"chapter 116<UN>spheres by feverishly dancing at ritualistic celebrations to musical renderings of poetry by the kabbalist and Torah scholar Shalom Shabazi (1619–1720).49 These scenes are comprised of fragments of kabbalistic texts that Hazaz inter-spersed, to distinctive emotional and prosodic effect.50Towards the end of Hazaz’s circuitous plot, Ya’ish immigrates to Palestine, where the revelations that he often had in Sana’a come to a grinding halt. As one of the book’s characters puts it, “the Land of Israel is the end of all the miracles.”51 The novel concludes with the protagonist deeply regretting this loss: “Indeed, he was not answered – not in word and not in action, not with a vision nor a dream. Every travail he travailed and every exertion he exerted did not help. The heavens were sealed before him and would not be opened for the rest of his days, forever.”52 Although Hazaz’s description of this stage in Ya’ish’s life is threadbare, the hero undergoes a transmigration and redeems himself via deeds, rather than visions. Upon encountering the temporal realm of Palestine, his religious-cum-mystical life changes so drastically that the “old 49 Ya’ish’s visions are concentrated in the third part of the book, but a few turn up in the fourth as well. The first two sections cover the hero’s youth, the early years of his marriage, and a litany of struggles. According to Halevy, these visions are a satire or parody of the mystics’ “fall;” Halevy, Image and Self-Portrait, 76–78, 87–93. In a few of Ya’ish’s ascents, the import of the kabbalistic world actually rises, even surpassing the heavenly realms. For instance, the angels that he encounters are not impressed with his stories of redemption. It is “doubtful,” Hazaz wrote, “that they hear and they certainly do not understand.” See Rabinovitz, “Between Supremacy and Inferiority,” 251–254; Bargad, Ideas in Fiction, 105. The satiric conversation with the angels was translated into English by Ezra Spicehandler: Hazaz, “Yaish Meets the Angels,” 51–57 [idem, Stories, 251–261].50 That said, it is worth remembering Abramson’s words on this topic: “The novel Ya’ish was influenced by the kabbalah, of course. And there is no need to go into detail and extrapo-late, only that when you check you find that not all the words of the kabbalah therein derive from the kabbalah’s sources, and some of them are nothing but the fruit of Hazaz’s ingenuity, who suited his language to the language of the kabbalah. There are those who sought to draw insights from this on the language of the Jewish ethnicities, such as the natives of Yemen, but this warrants extreme caution, two- and fourfold.

What is more, he alluded to the ideological revo-lution that was ushered in by the Jewish people’s new, profane historical real-ity. In a certain sense, then, Ya’ish’s aliyah (literally ascent), namely his immi-gration to Palestine, was his yeridah (descent).Similar to a handful of earlier writers from the First Aliyah (a wave of Jewish immigration to Palestine between 1882 and 1903), Hazaz enlisted “Yemenite mysticism” to the service of “the ideological story.” More specifically, he pre-sented images of Yemenite kabbalists that embody not only an ethnic way of life, but a “vision of the earthly redemption.” The shift from aliyah (ascension) to lofty spheres to aliyah (immigration) to the material Land of Israel became a basic template for some of Hazaz and his above-mentioned predecessors’ works.54Hazaz expanded on this theme in the novel HaYoshevet ba’Ganim (She Dwelleth in the Gardens, 1944). To some extent, this novel picks up where Ya’ish left off. Once again, the narrative revolves around the figure of a seer – a dream-er who calculates the end of the days – by the name of Mori Said, whose mysti-cal world is vanishing before his very eyes. In contrast to Ya’ish, this protagonist does not experience ascensions of the soul. His world is comprised of dreams that he interprets by connecting a myriad of gematrias and acronyms. As per the mystic’s understanding of his own dreams, the Exile has been abrogated; the messiah has already taken up residence in Jerusalem; and is on the verge of revealing himself. As Hazaz puts it, “all his dreams were really identical, 53 For a full analysis of this story, see Miron, Haim Hazaz, 47–111; Michali, By the Potter’s Wheel, 165–181; Bargad, “Hazaz’s Yemenite Works,” 232–250; idem, Ideas in Fiction, 101–109; Goitein, “Hazaz’s Yemenite Enterprise,” 232–244; Drori, Yemenite Redemption and New Hebraism. Also see Michal Oron, “Mystical Elements in the Novel Ya’ish,” 162–170. Oron provides a different interpretation of the closing scene, as he views the shuttering of heavens’ gates in a positive light. Alternatively, Ratzaby wrote that “Ya’ish, who in the Diaspora was the son of the kingdom of heaven, with his aliyah to the Land of Israel the gates of heaven were shut before him. This contains a hint of the lowering in the status of the religious and spiritual figure in the Yishuv [ Jewish settlement] in the Land of Isarael, which is causing the removal of the shkhinah [divine presence],” Ratzaby, “Hebrew Dia-lects,” 75, note 3. For more on Ratzaby’s interpretation, see Barzel, “Introduction,” 13–15. This reading appears to deviate widely from Hazaz’s own words, but the gates of interpre-tation have yet to be sealed.54 For more on this paradigm, see Berlovits, Inventing a Land, Inventing a People, 98–102; Gerber, Ourselves or Our Holy Books, 85–116."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"chapter 118<UN>variations on one central theme: the hour of redemption was near. And this was actually the cause of his aliya to Palestine... Mori Said had prophesied that hard tines would come, that they would pave the way for the Messiah’s ad-vent. In his interpretation every event, whether petty or significant, took on apocalyptic meaning and was crucial to Israel’s redemption.”55 Whereas Mori Said delves into the kabbalah, his progeny discover other worlds. The hero’s son, Ṣiyon (Zion), straddles the fence between two realms. At times, he boasts about the sanctity that he is engaged in; at other times, despair thrusts him into a life of sin. Alternatively, Ṣiyon’s daughter, Rumyeh (or Miriam), severs herself from the Orthodox community and runs away to a kibbutz. In parallel, Mori Said’s dreams turn from good to bad. Horrified, the protagonist searches for another path to the same destination, for he is certain that his revelations con-cerning the end of the days will come to pass. His solution is to convince peo-ple to cede their part in the afterworld to the messiah. If everyone did so, Mori Said assumes, the savior would certainly deign to expedite his arrival. However, the kabbalist’s appeal falls on deaf ears and his life falls apart. The protagonist ends up among the destitute panhandlers at the Western Wall, which he vows not to leave until the scion of David assumes the throne. The story ends with the hero’s tumultuous and painful death in a ruin adjacent to the Western Wall. In sum, Mori Said clings to a fading world and desperately awaits a tarrying messiah at an hour in which the redemption is being advanced by a compet-ing ideological camp – the builders of the temporal Land, who count his own children among their ranks.56Hazaz’s plot thus unveils the revolution that was triggered by the severance of the pioneers from the Diaspora. It was Berl Katznelson, a leading advocate of Labor Zionism, who remarked that Mori Said “is our Don Quixote.”57 In an interview conducted by Galia Yardeni in 1968, Hazaz explained his outlook: “At first, I assumed that kabbalah, kabbalists seeking to bring about the redemption – all this is ancient history, not a living reality. And lo and be-hold, amongst the Yemenites I found kabbalists who are preoccupied with 55 Cited in Bargad, Ideas in Fiction, 94.56 Hazaz, HaYoshevet baGanim [also see the English translation by Ben Halper: idem, Mori Sa’id].

This outlook comes across in, among other places, the writer’s short story “HaDrasha” (The Sermon, 1943),59 and his controversial play, BeKeṣ haYamim (The End of Days, 1934), on the Sabbatai Zvi era.60 In the latter, Hazaz described how Jews thirsted for liberation from the diaspora, as well as the accusations thrust by the false messiah’s acolytes at co-religionists who refused to see the light. Sabbatianism is portrayed as a movement that aroused national yearnings, to the point where Sabbatai Zvi is cast in the role of political savior.61 The play ends with Yuzpa, a character with apocalyptic leanings, calling for the Exile to be incinerated. Years later, Hazaz clarified this position, linking it to Zionism and the Holocaust:Yuzpa burns down the Exile, but we [i.e., Zionists] also incinerated the dispersions [that we left] behind us. All the polemicizing against the book [i.e., the play BeKeṣ haYamim] is a waste of time, for we did so our-selves. The Jews of Yemen and Iraq also incinerated the Diaspora. If only we really had burnt down the Exile, the people would have been saved. By burning down houses, by burning down property, the people would have been saved.... Instead, they sat carefree while calamity dangled over 58 Yardeni, “No Limits to Perfection,” 261–262.59 Hazaz, “HaDrasha,” in Avanim Rotḥot, 219–237 [idem, Stories, 231–249]. Another facet of this outlook turns up in “Drabkin,” ibid, 163–187 [idem, Stories, 203–230], which was writ-ten that same year. The story’s protagonist takes the opposite view of the sermon giver in “HaDrasha,” yet preserves the dichotomy between Judaism and Zionism. Similar devel-opments inform “Mar’ot Yerushalayim,” one of the author’s stories from the 1930s; idem, BeṢilan shel Malḥuyot, 169–297. At any rate, it bears noting that in Hazaz’s works, the Ex-ile’s negation does not come at the expense of a full description of the vitality of Diaspora life. This balancing act is discussed in Kurzweil, Our New Literature, 39–40, 260–266; idem, Facing the Spiritual Perplexity of Our Time, 120; Laor, The Struggle for Memory, 165.60 Hazaz, BeKeṣ haYamim.

There was no one to force them to be saved. If they had burnt down their houses, they would have been rescued.62In a conversation with Hayim Elhanani, the novelist took a similar stance:One of our comrades intimated that he was hurt by the lethal line on the Diaspora in The End of Days. Many got caught up in this matter. Yiddish-ists in America fought against The End of Days, claiming that ‘Hazaz is burning the Diaspora.’ It is true; it contains the incineration of the Exile; what is Zionism if not the burning of the Exile? From its inception, Zion-ism has always negated the Diaspora. Would that we had burnt down the Exile on our own before it was too late, for then Hitler would not have annihilated six million Jews.63While Hazaz’s oeuvre is not without conflicting trends, it is impossible to ig-nore the prevailing spirit.64These explicit statements by Hazaz are indeed commensurate with, inter alia, the final scenes of Ya’ish and haYoshevet baGanim. As per this worldview, the Diasporic version of the kabbalah and mysticism in general has no place in the modern Palestine. In fact, the loss of the Exile’s spiritual world is also manifest in the novelist’s devaluation of its literature as an invigorative en-terprise. Moreover, what Hazaz saw as the Exile’s religio-centric culture was bound, in his estimation, to be either revamped or annulled by the Zionist redemption. Under these circumstances, there was certainly no place for a positive description of kabbalah-oriented Jews in Palestine at the outset of the twentieth century. It is only logical that these kabbalists were portrayed as heading off a cliff.Perhaps this outlook does not faithfully express Hazaz’s personal views? The novelist is on record as stating that “it is a mistake to ascribe ruminations or opinions of a figure in a book to the author,” even if “now and again there is something to it, but not overtly, not all the way.”65 That said, the stories in 62 Cited from Hazaz’s remarks at the press conference on the opening night of the play at Habima Theater in 1950.

In this context, Megged went so far as to say that “Stories are neither a political program nor"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"21The Last Kabbalists<UN>question clearly reach the following conclusions: the Exile’s spiritual life is in its death throes; and Zionism is precipitating far-reaching changes in the Land of Israel.66 Even if we were to deny that literature is harnessed to simplistic political agendas, given the historical context in which Hazaz operated, it is impossible to ignore the picture that emerges from these works.67In a letter to Gershom Scholem from around 1972, Hazaz distinguished between “That which pertains to history and that which pertains to a play. History’s reach is short and is not an artistic creation. For this reason, the poem is charged with repairing history, hastening the belated, detracting and adding, etc.”68 These themes that the novelist developed were not an island onto themselves and even permeated – albeit in a refined and understated manner – the period’s research literature on Jewish mysticism. As a result, scholars presented a distorted picture of their contemporary kabbalists in Palestine. Hazaz’s “correction” of the historical image was an ideological outlook that was out of touch with reality. Decline and Zionist UtopiaA riveting picture of the kabbalistic circles in the Land of Israel can be found in Anshai Gil’ad (The Men of Gilead), a Zionist utopia written in 1942 by the future Biblical scholar Haim Gevaryahu. The protagonist, Shlomo, is “the head of a procession of young kabbalists from Jerusalem who moved to the Gilead for the sake of dwelling in the homeland of Elijah the Prophet.” To this end, a philosophical tract. Things that are communicated by the people in his stories – they are voices.” Megged, ibid, 85.66 For Hazaz’s position on the relation between the Diaspora and the Land of Israel, see his anthology of lectures and articles: Hazaz, Mishpat haGeula, 131–132, 139–164. Most astounding is the novelist’s determination that not an iota of mysticism has seeped into the New Hebrew literature, which he completely identifies with Zionism; see ibid, 114. In another lecture, Hazaz averred that Zionism is the final incarnation of the Jewish belief in the messiah. Furthermore, he stated that this movement will end differently than Sabbatianism; ibid, 150. On the importance of these lectures, which bear the same dialec-tic tensions and irony that characterize his stories, see Schweid, “Between Philosophizing and Narrative Fiction,” 20–34.67 Kabbalistic figures also surface in Hazaz, BeKolar Echad (In a Single Collar). In this story, the novelist portrays the father of Moshe Barazani (a member of the Jewish underground against the British Mandate in Palestine) as a kabbalist who studied at the Shoshanim leDavid Yeshiva and was a member of Yehuda Fetayah’s inner circle; Hazaz, BeKolar Echad, 63, 86, 206–207.68 Hazaz, Letter to Scholem, 1972 (ms); Cited in a manuscript by Werses, “Sabbatai Zevi and Sabbatianism in Modern Hebrew Literature,” 132."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"chapter 122<UN>they established a village by the name of Ḥakal Tapukhin (apple field). In “the [settlement’s] athenaeum for the youth of the prophets’ children,” Shlomo finds clay tablets containing the secret for growing cereals on trees. “The words of Elijah the Prophet of Thisbe,” the inscription reads, “where in the upper worlds that were destroyed crops grew on trees, and on account of the sin they have decreased in size and their stems die each and every summer.” The tablet’s next passage declares that the time for the “tikkun” has arrived. Towards the end, it notes that the “cereal apples” decisively altered the global economy.69 Gevarya-hu combined images of husbanding the Land with an old-school kabbalist to form a picture that is a far cry from the contemporaneous reality in Jerusalem. From this standpoint, his utopia is a critique, perhaps even a satire, of the era’s kabbalists.In a similar fashion, the only contemporary kabbalists that the Second Ali-yah poet David Shimoni (1891–1956) depicted in a positive fashion were those advancing the Zionist cause, which he ultimately viewed as an incarnation of “the messianic idea among the Jewish people.”70 Throughout his career, Shi-moni occasionally referred to kabbalists, but always in the same particular context. A case in point is an earlier play in which a Yemenite Jew integrates the vision of the redemption and tikkun ḥaṣot (Midnight Vigil) with toil in the vineyard.71 In another of the poet’s idylls, there is a short description of “a rich, wondrous kabbalist; by day he labors in his vineyards and by night he ponders the Zohar.”72 Shimoni also produced a more complex tableau. He considered the signs of the “land’s redemption” and the pioneers’ yearnings to be a quasi-transformation of the erstwhile longings of kabbalists and prophets. For example, in the idyll Maṣeva (A Memorial, 1928–1938), he wrote that “The redemption always appeared before my eyes in the image of an expansive field.”73 Upon describing the pioneers’ zeal, the poet turned his attention to seu-da shlishit (the third Sabbath meal), which became a central kabbalistic ritual 69 Gevaryahu, The Men of the Gilead: A Utopian Story of the Life in Eretz Yisrael over the Next Three Generations, citations from pp. 46, 56–57. Under the editorship of Shalom Schwartz (Ben-Baruch), the weekly Hed Yerushalayim put out a different version of this work in se-rial installments between June 1941 and January 1942. One of the first chapters of the serial version places an emphasis on the “Sons of the Prophets.”70 Halevy, Image and Self-Portrait, 37–56.

Shimoni essentially transformed this meal into a poem on nature and the Land of Israel, thereby adding a new wrinkle to this idea which suited the needs of his own generation. More specifically, he converted seuda shlishit into a dinner for the poor out in the field. By virtue of this meal, the lips of “Eretz Yisrael on high and the temporal Eretz Yisrael” met, “and the sensual touch,” along with “the mysterious touch of the messiah’s wing, delighted the coveted land, in the unknowns of the quest of the genera-tions [of Jews] who pleaded for the wonder of the redemption.”74 Thereafter, “the Torah of Eretz Yisrael” is described as the physical labor of the pioneer.75 Like Gevaryahu and others, this sort of utopian writing allowed Shimoni to release himself from and criticize the present, while lionizing the past, of all things. Perhaps the apotheosis of this “sub-genre” is a series of poems that he dedicated to the early kabbalists of Safad. These works draw heavily on the book Shivḥai HaARI (Praises of Isaac Luria). Although the series is devoid of hints concerning the present and although Shimoni’s ostensibly limited him-self to praising the poetry’s language, the very act of replication gave rise to a utopia that nourished the redemptive pioneering reality of his time.76It stands to reason that the above-mentioned Zionist writers had no de-sire to fathom their era’s kabbalistic worldview. Instead, they glanced at the mystics from afar and chose to emphasize those elements that suited their ac-counts of the emergent reality in the Land of Israel. Rather than describing the living spirit of the seminaries under review, they set their sights on the “pure kabbalistic knowledge” of yesteryear, “the last kabbalist” who is slowly going under, and/or “the first kabbalist” to break new ground.74 Ibid, 270–272.75 Ibid, 274, 285.76 Ibid, “Me’Agadot Ṣfat,” 165–187."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, ���6 | doi �0.��63/97890043��649_003<UN>chapter 2The Kabbalah Seminaries of Jerusalem Shalom Sharabi and the Rise of the Kabbalistic YeshivotIn recent years, writers are fashioning a new picture of early twentieth-century kabbalah circles in which a small handful of figures, particularly Yehuda Leib Ashlag and Abraham Isaac Kook, assume center stage. On more than one occa-sion, though, the spotlight is being maneuvered by the aggressive and outspo-ken latter-day followers of these same kabbalists, at the expense of other key players. Accounts of Jerusalem’s kabbalah seminaries are nowhere to be found in these works, and conjecture as to the demise of Jewish mysticism has even infiltrated the research literature.1The Beit El Yeshiva was clearly the largest and most renowned kabbalah seminary, as throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries many Jews turned their eyes to this institution. Most of Jerusalem’s kabbalists adhered to the way of the RaShaSh. Even if some practitioners adopted more nuanced or countervailing positions vis-à-vis those endorsed by Beit El, all of Jerusalem’s early twentieth-century kabbalah seminaries saw themselves as Sharabian in-stitutions, followed in the footsteps of the Beit El Yeshiva, and focused their attention on the Zoharic and Lurianic literature as well as the writings of the RaShaSh and its offshoots.2 Already in the 1800s, like-minded centers were es-tablished in Baghdad and Aram Ṣoba (a Jewish toponym for Ḥalab, namely Al-lepo). The blossoming of the new centers in Jerusalem at the outset of the twen-tieth century was largely spurred on by the relocation of influential kabbalists from these communities to the Land of Israel, along with the tireless efforts 1 For a discussion on these preliminary accounts of the kabbalah streams at the outset of the twentieth century, which are gradually changing the accepted view, see Garb, The Chosen will Become Herds; idem, “Mystical and Spiritual Discourse,” 17–36; idem, “Contemporary Kabbal-ah and Classical Kabblah,” 19–46; Myers, “Kabbalah at the Turn of the 21st Century,” 175–190; Huss, “Altruistic Communism,” 109–130; idem, “The New Age of Kabbalah,” 107–125; idem, “All You Need Is lav,” 611–624; Mayse, From the Depth of the Well, 270–280, 349–354; Meir, “Light and Vessels,” 163–247; idem, “Wrestling with the Esoteric,” 585–647; idem, “The Revealed and the Revealed within the Concealed,” 151–258; idem, “New Findings concerning R.

Although the hardships that the Beit El Yeshiva faced in the early 1900s (a topic that will be expounded on below) led to a decrease in its “student body,” new and vibrant centers with a similar spirit were concomitantly founded in the city. Before delving into this renaissance of Jerusalem-based kabbalah circles, the way in which its members grasped the RaShaSh and his thought warrants a close look.Kabbalists espousing many and manifold outlooks indeed coexisted in Beit El from the yeshiva’s very inception. A generation after Sharabi’s passing, though, his worldview and approach to prayer intentions and Lurianic thought steadily came to define the “Beit El way” and emerged as the hallmark of its sustained exceptionalism. While some of Beit El’s regulars undoubtedly took issue with the RaShaSh’s way, there is no denying that it was the cornerstone of the kabbalah world, as even his critics were preoccupied with responding to the Sharabian gospel.3In fact, the RaShaSh was widely viewed as no less than the reincarnation of HaARI, and his approach became the final word on practicing Jewish mysti-cism. As early as 1853, R. Haim Palaggi noted that “Alas we have the great Torah scholar and Hasid, renowned in kabbalah, Rabbi Master Shalom Sharabi of blessed memory, may his merit protect us amen, of whom they said that our rabbi HaARI of blessed memory promised his students when he would dip into his ritual immersion when they led him to have him buried [that] if you will merit it I will come to you another time; for the rabbi, HaARI, came to them again in the form of R. Shalom.”4At the turn of the twentieth century, R. Chaim Shaul Dweck-HaKohen per-sonally copied Palaggi’s words atop a manuscript version of an introduction to one of Sharabi’s works that was in the possession of the Rehovot haNahar Yeshiva, to which he added the following words: “From this we may deduce that our holy teacher the RaShaSh was an incarnation of our rabbi HaARI, and 3 Shlomo Molkho, among the sages of Salonica and Izmir, arrived in Jerusalem circa 1780. In his book Shemen Zayit Zakh, he called into question the RaShaSh’s interpretation of HaARI’s works. For an in-depth look at the debate that this sparked, see Avivi, Kabbala Luriana, vol. 1, 756–757; vol. 3, 1064–1069.4 Palaggi, Toḥekhot Hayim, vol. 2, 96b. He repeated this point, albeit more garrulously, in 1859; idem, Kaf haḤayim, §32, letter 18, 258b-259a. Similar sentiments are to be found in the writings of one of Beit El’s leading figures; Aharon Refael Chaim Perera, Efer Yiṣḥaq, 9b. This outlook is also expressed in a book from 1913: Aharon ’Eli ha-Kohen Tawil, Sefer Yiśakhar uZevulun, 37b-38a. Though assuming various forms, this tradition recurs in several works. E.g., Dablitski, Makhshevet Beṣalel, 83; Mutzafi, “Introduction,” in De la Rosa, Sefer Torat Ḥakham, 21–23; Gepner, Midrasho shel Shem, 62; Hillel, Ahavat Shalom, 3–9; idem, Aspakla-riah, 26–30; Giller, “Leadership and Charisma,” 29–31."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"chapter 226<UN>his disciples are the disciples of HaARI of blessed memory.”5 In a similar vein, kabbalists described revelations that were conveyed to Sharabi by Elijah the Prophet and other revered figures. Moreover, they claimed that the RaShaSh settled esoteric matters that were concealed from R. Hayyim Vital and revealed other secrets as well.6 These beliefs are evident from the contemporary writ-ings of one Yaakov Moshe Hillel, the rosh yeshiva of Ḥevrat Ahavat Shalom, a kabbalah seminary in Jerusalem. According to Hillel, Sharabi “came to the world to put the finishing touches on and explain the thought of HaARI.” In addition, he “had the good fortune to complete the revelation of Rabbi Hayyim Vital. For this reason, the greats of the generations after him accepted his way and the approach of our master the RaShaSh of blessed memory in the expla-nation and arrangement of the thought of HaARI, with the same level of ac-ceptance as HaARI’s authority; for this reason they do not budge from his view and method so much as an iota. And they accepted his words as absolute truth from Sinai, without dissent.”7 While some kabbalists disagreed with this firm stance, it was certainly the prevailing outlook among the Jerusalem circles of the early 1900s.Praise of this sort turns up in almost every book that was put out by the RaShaSh’s own students and adherents in subsequent generations, on through the twentieth century. For example, accolades were incorporated into works that raise the banner of Sharabi’s works, including tikkunim (vigils), rituals that he authored or revised, his explanatory notes for books, and his arrangements of prayer intentions. A case in point is a 1866 recommendation by R. Yedidyah Raphael Chai Abulafia (1806–1869) – the head of Beit El Yeshiva in the 5 Dweck-HaKohen, Pe’at HaSaDeH, vol. 2, 223. As per his own testimony, Yeshaya Asher Zelig Margaliot heard the same story from Dweck-HaKohen in 1930: “What is written in the end of Sefer haGilgulim [Vital’s Book of Incarnations] that our rabbi HaARI said before his holy soul departed with a kiss. That if you shall merit it, I will come to you and teach you, see therein. We have a tradition that it was our rabbi the master Shalom Sharabi who came once again to this world to open the gates of HaARI like the opening of a hall. And to illuminate and examine in deep and plain words. And joyous is he that has merited to study the writings of HaARI as was instructed by the RaShaSh in the way of his sanctity.” Margaliot, Sefer Yashev Ruḥo, 4a.

And there was even an episode involving a Torah scholar of blessed memory, who on a certain matter wrote the opposite [of Sharabi’s view], and he had a revelation [from heaven] that appeared to be a support for his position. Nevertheless, we do not listen to this. As is known to a couple of Torah scholars here in the holy city, the Ra-ShaSh’s words are for the strong pillar to illuminate the path of the Jewish greats, and the keepers of the holy spirit from the generations before us of blessed memory. And to this day thus behave the sages of the con-cealed [Torah], may God protect and save them, for whom the RaShaSh’s words illuminated a path.9In an anthology of kabbalah books that came out in around 1922, R. Akiva Po-rush (1881–1922), Shapira’s student, went even further:Anyone that engrossed himself in [and] expanded on Rehovot haNahar and dove into the depths of Nahar Shalom and the Siddur by our teacher the rabbi Shalom Sharabi, will understand that they are to the books of 8 “And it is already known that anyone who grabs Sefer Eṣ Ḥayyim with the aforementioned an-notations [of the RaShaSh], comes to the conclusion that one who learns Eṣ Ḥayyim without the annotations of Master Shalom, regarding such a student it is said commandments done by rote, and he will addle his mind in the spring of confusion, it is all a pitfall, he does not understand from the end to the beginning, for he is like a drunk in the middle of the sea, and he does not know in what direction the light shall rest. When we saw some associates who compiled many a book, they dove into mighty waters, came up with shards in their hands, and so on and so forth. In fact all who grab a book and desire to partake from the fruit of the tree must traverse the river [i.e., the RaShaSh’s book Nahar Shalom – Shalom’s River], where he will find a haven to illuminate the eyes of the wise, and his words are living and binding.” Abulafia, “Approval for Eṣ Ḥayyim.” Hillel discusses this recommendation in idem, Aspakla-riah, 19.9 Shapira, Seder Tikkun Ḥaṣot, vol. 2, 2636. R. Shlomo Molkho put forth a question on the Ra-ShaSh’s approach, which was affirmed in, among other places, a dream of Eliezer ben Tuvo – a scholar from the Maghreb. For more on this episode, see Dablitski, Makhshevet Beṣalel, 73 (who heard it from Yosef Leib Zussman); Hillel, Aspaklariah, 18–19; idem, Ahavat Shalom, 151; Giller, Shalom Shar’abi and the Kabbalists of Beit El, 91–92."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"chapter 228<UN>our rabbi HaARI like Maimonides and the Tur and the Shulḥan Arukh are to the Talmud, as well as the books of HaARI are to the Zohar and the Tikkunei Zohar.10There is little doubt, then, that many of Jerusalem’s kabbalists saw the RaShaSh as a transcendent figure, even if they integrated disparate traditions and ele-ments into their own approach.Sharabi’s leading role in these same circles can also be discerned from the content of dreams – a genre that was quite popular among kabbalists and therefore warrants our undivided attention. In these visions, words of Torah – scriptural, Talmudic, and kabbalistic innovations along with esoteric mysteries – were revealed. The RaShaSh frequently surfaces in these recollec-tions. Among the purposes of his “visits” was to validate a novel idea, approve a forthcoming book, afford physical or spiritual succor, and rescue the dreamer from some danger.11 For example, in one dream, Sharabi reprimanded a kab-balist for finding fault with a passage of a book by the savant’s grandson.12As a direct result of this worldview, the RaShaSh’s approach was considered the only faithful (or alternatively, the most perspicacious) interpretation of Lurianic thought. This perception led kabbalists to object to or ignore other works of kabbalah.13 A case in point is the following exchange between Yosef 10 Porush, Merkavah Shlema, “Small Opening,” 3. These words turn up at the beginning of a most unusual book, which has nothing to do with Lurianic or Sharabian kabbalah. Ac-cording to Porush, he toiled on this book for several reasons: “In this sort of orphaned generation, even after all the study of the Eṣ Ḥayyim and the eight gates and Minḥa Blulah beShemen and the intention in the siddur of our teacher the rabbi the RaShaSh and the rest of the yiḥudim, one must still take heed not to be overtaken by disgrace and oppro-brium heaven forbid for the great day of judgment.”11 E.g., Aharon Azriel wrote that the RaShaSh appeared to him while he was ill and gave a quasi-recommendation for his book; Azriel, Sefer Kapei Aharon, part 1, “Second Introduc-tion;” Moskowitz, Ḥayei haRashash, 85–89; Grayevski, Miginzei Yerushalayim. Likewise, in Shlomo Tzofioff ’s dream, the RaShaSh allegedly prayed on behalf of Jacob S. Kassin; Hillel, “The Life of Jacob Kassin,” 69.12 The “culprit” in this episode is Eliyahu Suliman Mani. While studying with Nissim Eyni from the book Divrei Shalom by Rafael Avraham Sharabi (the RaShaSh’s grandson), a dif-ficult passage came up. Mani asserted that the author of the work in question did not get to the bottom of the RaShaSh’s words. As soon as these words left Mani’s lips, he lost his ability to speak. Following a confession, the RaShaSh came to Mani in a dream and reprimanded him. As a result, the dreamer subsequently proclaimed in a manuscript “Not to criticize Sefer Divrei Shalom.” Mani, Sefer Meʻil Eliyahu, 6.

Yosef Hayyim replied that he should test out all the candidates and ask each scholar to explain several pages of Sharabi’s work of kabbalah Nahar Shalom. In the end, he should choose the one who discerns all the hints to HaARI’s writ-ings in those of the RaShaSh, compares between the two savants’ oeuvres, and manages to reconcile the supposed contradictions between them. Upon find-ing the right mentor, tell him, R. Yosef Hayyim added, to “please teach me the wisdom of truth that was revealed by our rabbi HaARI. If you understand these texts clearly, then it is for the best [because] I truly thirst for the words of our rabbi HaARI that you will teach me; and if heaven forbid your mind is confused by them, why would you confuse me”14 According to one tradition, the novice who sought Hayyim’s guidance was Suliman Eliyahu, who ended up studying under Chaim Shaul Dweck-HaKohen at Rehovot haNahar.15The major kabbalah seminaries in Jerusalem all toed the same line with re-spect to the study of Lurian and Sharabian thought. Accordingly, most of the customs that they observed, the tikkunim they instituted, and the prayers they formulated were based on these traditions. In addition, their way of life re-volved around the RaShaSh’s prayer intentions, which were usually copied onto folios and disseminated to other places as well. The kabbalists at these yeshivot worked diligently on these intentions during prayers that lasted for hours on end, as this practice was considered the very essence of learning Torah and worshipping God.16 For this reason, a string of warnings was targeted at those 14 Yosef Hayyim, Sefer Da’at uTvunah, “The Author’s Foreword.” In several places Yosef Hayy-im reiterated the need for and importance of learning kabbalah orally from the mouth of a wise rabbi according to an established tradition. He even went so far as to equate one who studies exclusively from books to a congenitally blind person who is taken to the pal-ace and given an explanation of the splendor before him; Yosef Hayyim, Rav Pe’alim, part 3, “Sod Yesharim,” §13, 130a. Also see ibid, §1, 1a-2b. Hayyim’s contention that it is incum-bent upon kabbalists to reconcile the contradictions between HaARI and the RaShaSh is tied to R. Shlomo Molkho’s claims in Shemen Zayit Zakh; see Avivi, Kabbala Luriana, vol. 3, 1064–1069.15 Hillel, “The Life of Suliman Eliyahu,” 28–29; Meir, “Toward the Popularization of Kab-balah,” 148–149.16 Giller expands on how Jerusalem’s kabbalists prayed in the Sharabian tradition and on the meaning of kavvanot; idem, “Between Poland and Jerusalem,” 226–250; idem, “Leadership"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"chapter 230<UN>who approached this kind of prayer. Alternatively, plaudits were heaped on mystics that advanced to the level of mekhavven (intenter) – a title outranking that of mekubal (kabbalist).17 Sharabi’s commentary on the Lurianic kabbalah, which for all intents and purposes was an additional floor of that same edifice as well as a new kabbalistic method in its own right, gradually became the only reading that is deemed to be faithful to HaARI’s thought.18 Although not a focal point for most of Jerusalem’s kabbalists, commentaries that diverged from the RaShaSh’s path (especially the kabbalistic writings of the Vilna Gaon’s disciples and Hasidic works) were nevertheless copied, printed, and studied in Jerusalem. Manuscript copies of, say, R. Abraham Abulafia’s works could also be found on Beit El’s shelves during the nineteenth century. In fact, the ye-shiva’s habitués went to great lengths to obtain these texts and occasionally copied them alongside the RaShaSh’s intentions. However, there is no evidence that these writings were studied in a systematic and orderly fashion.19 In any and Charisma,” 21–41; idem, Shalom Shar’abi and the Kabbalists of Beit El; Kallus, The Theurgy of Prayer in the Lurianic Kabbalah; Mezuman, The Intentions of the Four Deeds. Also see Green’s lucid description: “Kabbalah developed a highly complex system of kav-vanot for...the daily prayers. Each divine name that appeared in the siddur was taken as a reference to some permutation of the sefirot. The precise wording of the prayer text became the object of seemingly endless commentary and mystical speculation. Praying with the proper kavvanot required great amounts of time and patience, in addition to significant kabbalistic learning;” idem, These are the Words, 131. We will expand on the siddur’s first print run below.17 Hillel elaborates on this topic in idem, Ahavat Shalom, 241–310.18 The RaShaSh’s gospel and the changes that he introduced to Lurian kabbalah are not broached herein. For a discussion on these topics, see Giller, Shalom Shar’abi and the Kab-balists of Beit El; idem, Kabbalah, 132–134; Avivi, Kabbala Luriana, vol. 2, 756–757, 782–788, 853–854, 898; vol. 3, 1052–1053, 1064–1069. Avivi also examines Lurianic kabbalah and the writings of HaARI’s adherents under Sharabi’s tutelage.19 For example, Sasson ben Moshe (the head of the Beit El Yeshiva until 1903) possessed manuscripts of Abraham Abulafia’s Sefer Ḥayei Olam haBah and Sefer Sulam haAliyah. See Scholem and Yisakhar, Catalogus codicum Cabbalisticorum Hebraicorum, 33. Several of Abulafia’s works that were copied at Jerusalem kabbalah seminaries are preserved at the Israel National Library and in Shlomo Moussaieff ’s manuscript collection. However, there was apparently some resistance to Abulafian thought in the early twentieth century. For instance, Shimon Zvi Horowitz deprecates Abulafia in a book that, first and foremost, praises the kabbalah and beseeches its readers to delve into this body of knowledge; Horowitz, Sefer Ohr haMei’r veKol Mevaser, 19b-20a (including Solomon ben Aderet’s fa-mous words against Abulafia).

A survey of the institution’s regulars and their activity indicates that they were interested in a wide selection of topics. For instance, many of them penned books of homiletic literature and ethics, tikkunim, Talmud commentaries, and an array of Halakhic books.20This state of affairs basically endured until 1948. Be that as it may, the ex-pansion of Beit El’s “student body” and the founding of new yeshivot of this sort inevitably triggered riveting changes that diversified the approach of the Sharabian kabbalists. Beit El’s Astonishment at Reports of Its DeclineIn essence, the status of early twentieth-century kabbalah appreciably dif-fered from the morbid accounts that we highlighted in the introduction. By the tail end of the 1800s, Beit El had certainly seen better days, and the major earthquake that hit the region in 1927 severely damaged the yeshiva’s building. As a result, quite a few of its regulars transferred to other seminaries. In 1929, Eliezer Rivlin wrote the following description in his annotations to Frumkin’s above-cited book, The Annals of Jerusalem’s Sages:Over the past few years, the bundle of Jerusalem’s kabbalists has come apart, and they have been divided among a few yeshivot. The Beit El Syn-agogue was almost completely destroyed; the kabbalists have left it, and its books have been scattered in every direction, and the building itself was almost completely ruined in the great earthquake that took place on the 11th of Tamuz 5687.21While all this information is true, Rivlin failed to mention that the yeshiva was rebuilt and continued to operate virtually without pause until 1948.22 There are beautiful accounts of Beit El that were penned duirng the first half of 20 For a description of Beit El’s resident scholars from its establishment in 1737 to its tempo-rary relocation in 1948, see Gepner, Midrasho shel Shem.21 Note by Eliezer Rivlin in Frumkin, Toldot Ḥakhmei Yerushalayim, vol. 3, 122.22 For a description of the yeshiva’s renovation and activities in 1928, see Baruch, “Qehal Ḥasidim,” 296–300; Hedaya, Sefer Deiah ṿeHaskel, vol. 1, 15a; Gaon, Oriental Jews, vol. 1, 142–143; Haibi, ’Anaq haRuaḥ 97–98.

For instance, Shmuel Yosef Agnon, who occasionally prayed in the yeshiva, rendered belletristic portraits thereof. According to his own testimony, the Nobel laureate befriended a few of its kabbalists, who helped him translate parts of the Zohar that are quoted in his popular anthology Yamim Nora’im (1938).23At any rate, when Beit El’s own habitués got word of Rivlin’s claims, they were indeed aghast. Nevertheless, the regulars wasted no time in articulating a firm riposte. In a 1931 anthology on the Azriel family and its connection to Beit El, the yeshiva’s scholars also sought to debunk the hypothesis as to their sharp decline. More specifically, a letter was sent by “The Holy Community of the Beit El Hasids” to the book’s editor, Pinhas Grayevsky. Signed by the kabbalists and sextons Shalom Hedaya, Shmuel Azran, Avraham Azriel, Naftali Baruch, and Yeshuah ben Sasson, they described the yeshiva as a vibrant place bustling with a wide range of activities, including the following:And on the 14th of Shvat the eve of the passing of the rabbi and sage Sha-lom Mizrahi Sharabi a righteous person of blessed memory the founder of this holy place, we do a huge [night of ] study for the ascension of his soul and most of Jerusalem’s sages and rabbis come and the building will be filled as will the court and the sukkah what with the lack of space. And a few Torah scholars learn all night and the sexton of the holy commu-nity remunerates them each according to his status; furthermore, on the sixth week of the Omer24 we schedule a study session every night on the kabbalah, as was instituted by the founders, like angels may their virtue protect us amen, and on the sixth night of the sixth week we do a tikkun karet to repair the yesod [foundation] and [pray for] the success of all the people that consecrate and maintain this place.

In fact, the yeshiva continued to operate more or less in this fashion until 1948. The seminary was headed by R. Sasson ben Moshe (1823–1903) from 1883 to 1903.26 He was succeeded by Massoud Alhadad HaKohen (1820–1927) who, among other things, stood at the institution’s helm and regularly led the congregation in prayer, until his death at a ripe old age.27 Between approximately 1927 and 1945, the mantle was held by Shalom Hedaya (1864–1944), who immigrated to Jerusalem from Allepo in 1899.28Throughout these years, Beit El continued to dispatch rabbinical emissar-ies to various lands for the sake of collecting money for the institution and its students.29 An extant leaflet and account book from a fundraising mission 25 Grayevsky, Miginzei Yerushalayim, 18.

It was the incumbent rosh yeshiva, Ovadia Hedaya (1889–1969) who renewed the yeshiva’s activities outside the Old City’s walls.37 In a draft of a fundraising appeal from the 1950s, Hedaya bemoaned the paucity of kabbal-ists in his lifetime:Much to our regret [the kabbalah] is steadily fading into oblivion. We remember the kabbalist rabbis in and outside the [Old] City, that there were kabbalistic synagogues in Beit El founded by the RaShaSh may his merit protect us amen as well as in the Bukharan Quarter which also abounded with their virtues; their huge merit safeguarded the entire world, and now much to our regret this entire generation has come to a close and passed on, and all that remain are o[ne] from [the] city and two from the family; about four years ago I stood up and drew encouragement to coordinate and renew the great yeshiva of Beit El, but unfortunately the opportunity has yet to present itself to me to fully renew it given the absence of a designated venue for this purpose and the lack of a helper and supporter; for I have seen mystics and they are few – there is no aspi-rant and no seeker.38It appears that Hedaya’s words are more an outpouring of nostalgia for a by-gone generation and an attempt to demonstrate that he was the faithful cus-todian of its legacy than an accurate diagnosis of the state of kabbalah at the time.Kapei Aharon, “Second Introduction.” Also see Grayevski, Miginzei Yerushalayim, 18; Ge-pner, Midrasho shel Shem, 63; Bension, Shalom Sharabi, 58.35 Beit El Yeshiva, Pinkas Shemot, 1934–1940 (ms).

Moreover, tens of individual kabbalists studied outside the yeshiva frame-work; and at times, they attracted study groups and disciples of their own. All of these figures toiled, in one way or the other, to disseminate Jewish esoteric knowledge in the early 1900s. Elsewhere, I examined the dozens of kabbalists who were active in the city during this period, but these figures have yet to be researched in an exhaustive manner. Each of them was tied, to some de-gree, with at least one or more seminaries in the city.39 This enterprise gave rise to a sort of Jerusalem kabbalah renaissance. Among the new yeshivot that significantly contributed to this phenomenon were Rehovot haNahar, which opened its doors in around 1896; Sha’ar Shamayim, which was established about a decade later; and the Oz veHadar Yeshiva, which has been in existence since 1923. Every institution had a unique character; and a host of influential kabbalists – only a small portion of whom will be mentioned over the course of this book – gravitated around each yeshiva. On occasion, these individuals were affiliated with multiple institutions, as some of their names turn up on the rosters of a couple of the seminaries at one and the same time. Moreover, established kabbalah groups met at several of Jerusalem’s synagogues as well as private residences and synagogues that were founded by Hasidic courts. From the 1940s onwards, many kabbalists arrived in the Land of Israel, and these new arrivals indeed warrant a survey of their own. Not surprisingly, there was a concomitant upsurge of seminaries in Jerusalem with kabbalah studies on the curriculum.The stated objective of most of these yeshivot was neither to increase kab-balah wisdom among young Jews within the institution’s confines nor design a standard approach to teaching this literature. Instead, the official role of these independent institutions was to provide for the livelihood of Torah scholars with a long track record in this field.40 To this end, the yeshivot regularly dis-patched emissaries on fundraising missions. The most active players in this arena were Beit El and Sha’ar Shamayim, both of which garnered considerable support from abroad. Comprehensive descriptions of these and other seminar-ies were penned by their founders and habitués as well as random visitors to 39 Meir, “Wrestling with the Esoteric,” 585–647.40 Luncz, “The Jews in the Land of Israel,” 192–193; Ben Hillel HaKohen, Atkhalta, 122–123; Ben-Arieh, A City Reflected in its Times, 346–347, 413; Ben-Naeh, “Religious Life in Nine-teenth Century Jerusalem,” 332–333, 337."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"37The Kabbalah Seminaries Of Jerusalem<UN>Jerusalem.41 At times, the kabbalistic schools operated alongside other frame-works, such as talmud torahs (Talmudic academies) and synagogues; these af-filiates even shared the same name. In other words, some of the institutions ran two separate divisions under the same roof. For example, Sha’ar haShamay-im established special talmud torahs, and Oz veHadar was an in-house “sub-sidiary” of Porat Yosef. At any rate, the publications of the various seminaries indicate that most of them allocated resources to both kabbalah and Talmudic studies.Zvi Meroni, who in the late 1930s canvassed the “lives of Jerusalem’s kab-balists” from the outside looking in, concluded (in his book The Dreamers in Jerusalem: Sketches of the Lines and the Dreamers, Esotericism, and Kabbalists in the Jerusalemite Present) that his subjects had ushered in a mystical “renais-sance.” In his estimate, there are 500 Jewish mystics in Jerusalem, “half of them study in public [i.e., in yeshivot specializing in kabbalah] and half on a solitary basis.” All told, he offered a romantic and far-fetched account of the kabbalis-tic “magic” that permeated the city.42 However, his assessment that Jerusalem had an unparalleled number of frameworks for studying Jewish mysticism was certainly not an exaggeration. Rehovot haNaharMany observers considered Rehovot haNahar to be the preeminent kabbalah seminary in Jerusalem during the first half of the twentieth century – a sort of new Beit El or its successor. Headed by R. Chaim Shaul Dweck-HaKohen of Allepo (1857–1933),43 the institution was founded in the Bukharan Quarter circa 1896 by a cadre of kabbalists who broke off from the venerable Beit El Yeshiva. The lion’s share of Rehovot haNahar’s budget was provided by Nissim Nahum (1863–1927), an affluent Tripolitan who practiced kabbalistic mortifi-cation. In the years ahead, Nahum would also help finance the establishment 41 See, for instance, the general accounts of contemporaneous observers: Abraham Sam-uel Herschberg, In Oriental Lands, 302, 429–430; Meroni, The Dreamers, 65–118; Unger, “MeḤayei Kat haMequbalim,” 716–718.42 Meroni, The Dreamers, 72–73.43 Shapira, “The Elder of the Kabbalists,” 6; Laniado, “The Elder of the Kabbalists,” 3; idem, LaQedoshim asher baAReṢ, 8, xvii-xviii (with his picture); Sutton, Aleppo, 172–178; Mos-kowitz, Ḥayei haRashash, 95–98; Hillel, “The Life of Dweck-HaKohen,” 23–31, 41; Afang’in, HaRashash, 326–331; Kallus, The Theurgy of Prayer, 127–129; Pozailov, From Bukhara to Je-rusalem, 246–248; idem, The Great Rabbis of Syria and Lebanon, 148–160; Giller, Shalom Shar’abi and the Kabbalists of Beit El, 58–59, 88–89."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"chapter 238<UN>of Porat Yosef and Sha’ar haShamayim. Moreover, he footed the printing costs for numerous kabbalah books.44 Generous backing, not least the property for the seminary, also came from the elites of Jerusalem’s Bukharan communi-t y.45 Foremost among them was Shlomo Moussaieff (1852–1922), among the neighborhood’s founders. A practitioner of the kabbalah in his own right, Moussaieff opened his home and library to Rehovot haNahar’s sages, inter alios.46While passing through the Bukharan Quarter in 1899–1900, Abraham Sam-uel Herschberg, a Jewish pilgrim from Bialystok, entered the said yeshiva and made the following observations:I visited its synagogue and its beit midrash, both of which are simple rooms with benches next to the walls and mats spread out on the ground. In its beit midrash I found sages from Aram Ṣoba (Allepo) sitting on the mats and studying books of kabbalah. These sages are subsisted by the community for this purpose. Additionally, I found two young Sephardim sitting alone and delving into Eṣ Ḥayyim by R. Hayyim Vital. I struck up a conversation with these young scholars and reminded them of what it is said: that youngsters like them should avoid [studying kabbalah], and they apologized to me, for they do not really study it.4744 For more on the patron, see Kassin, Sefer Pri Eṣ haGan, vol. 1, 75–104; Laniado, LaQedoshim asher baAReṢ, 96–97; Sutton, Aleppo, 282–283.

This patronage is also discussed in Pozailov, From Bukhara to Jerusalem, 233, 246–247; Wharman, The Bukharians, 52. During the first years of its existence, the yeshiva resided in Shlomo Moussaieff ’s synagogue. From 1899 until the early 1930s, it was in the Issacharoff-Babayof Synagogue, whereupon it relocated to the neighborhood of Maḥane Yehudah. See Rehovot haNahar, Report, 1938 (ms).46 For more on Moussaieff as well as his library and its wealth of kabbalistic manuscripts, see Avivi, Ohel SheM; Pozailov, Bukharan Jewry, 325–353; idem, From Bukhara to Jerusa-lem, 355–356.

He posited that the holy tongue was chosen because it was the only one that all the participants had in common. Despite the use of the “renewed” ancestral language, Herschberg commented that the Bukharians are far removed from any national ardor or Zionism, for they “are radical Orthodox predisposed toward the secrets of the kabbalah.”48The founding core of the Rehovot haNahar Yeshiva was indeed comprised of sages from Allepo. However, it appears that scholars from other ethnic com-munities soon got on board, as they were all united by their affinity to the Ra-ShaSh’s way and the unique personality of Chaim Shaul Dweck-HaKohen.Dweck-HaKohen began immersing himself in kabbalah back in Allepo, where the Sharabian gospel had arrived at an early stage. Already in the Ra-ShaSh’s lifetime, tens of manuscript copies of his siddur with the intentions – subsequently known as the “short version” – were distributed in Allepo. Although we lack firm evidence of standardized kabbalah study in Allepo, it appears that a quasi-kabbalistic yeshiva was founded there in around 1830. The institution’s habitués prayed in accordance to the RaShaSh’s intentions and copied significant portion of his writings. During this period, the city’s main Sharabian figures were Eliyahu Mishan (ob. 1882) and Nissim Harari-Raful (ob. 1870). The former maintained close ties with Beit El’s practitioners, foremost among them Yedidyah Raphael Chai Abulafia. Harari-Raful possessed exact copies of and engrossed himself in the nuances of the RaShaSh’s siddur. Both of these kabbalists cultivated several disciples. Dweck-HaKohen, who emerged which sages from Aram Ṣoba sit all day and deliberate over kabbalah books and they [i.e., members of the community] subsist them;” Herschberg, Mishpat haYishuv heḤadash, 14.48 Herschberg, BeEreṣ haMizraḥ, 430: “I visited the building of the talmud torah’s two depart-ments: the Holy Scriptures, [taught] in the grammar of the Hebrew language and also one matter in the Talmud and I found proficiency in their studies. In particular, I was amazed that all the studies learnt in this building are in Hebrew, and their method of learning came out by them not according to [sic] an external awakening of nationalists and Zionists – movements that are a great distance from the Bukharians who are radical Haredis predisposed toward the secrets of the kabbalah, but rather simply out of neces-sity, since the Sephardic teachers do not know the Bukharian that flows from the mouths of the pupils and they do not hear the Sephardic tongue of the instructors.... In its own right this method deserves to be the standard for our generation and our elders them-selves particularly in the Land of Israel.” Also see Themanlys, “The Beth El Kabbalist,” 23. The question of whether to teach in Hebrew, Yiddish, or other languages indeed became a bone of contention between the various groups in the Yishuv. In traditional Sephardic society, there were members who adopted the “Hebrew in Hebrew” approach for reasons that diverged from the concerns of the “language’s reformers,” like Eliezer Ben-Yehuda. For precedents of this sort, see Haramati, Three who Preceded Ben-Yehuda, among others."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"chapter 240<UN>from this same circle,49 had another mentor, R. Mordechai Abadi (ob. 1883). Adopting a slightly different kabbalistic approach than his colleagues, Abadi taught a few other students as well.50In around 1890, Dweck-HaKohen arrived in the Land of Israel from Allepo, along with a group of other sages and kabbalists, where he joined the ranks of the Beit El Yeshiva. A bevy of Allepo natives, including Yom Tov Yedid Halevi, Ezra Harari-Raful, Shaul Kassin, Isaac Shrem, and Dweck-HaKohen, were regu-larly present at the seminary. Within a couple of years, they would become the founding core of the Rehovot haNahar Yeshiva. Vidal ben Chanoch Angil described the evolution of this group:Two individuals from Ḥalab, Rabbi Shaul [Dweck-] HaKohen and Rabbi Yom Tov Levi, reached the community of Hasids [i.e., Beit El]; and they have arrived filled with the eight gates [i.e., HaARI’s writings], and they are practiced to some degree in the siddur, and they study with us a bit in a group from the siddur, and they already practically started to pray with kavvanot, and we were happy, for it seems that they are holy from the womb and will be frequent [attenders of the yeshiva]; with God’s help, may all the mekhavvnim from the Sephardic community be upright and worthy of this undertaking.51Despite the glowing first impressions, a rift gradually formed in Beit El, due to tension between the younger habitués and the veterans (as evident from sev-eral comments in the kabbalist Shalom Mizrahi Adani’s 1899 book)52 as well as 49 Laniado, LaQedoshim asher baAReṢ, 160–161; Sutton, Aleppo, 76–79, 275–276, 206–210; Hillel, Emet meAram Ṣoba, 7–9.

Among the regulars at the new institution were, at various stages, Avraham Antebbi, Shaul Kassin, Avraham Ades, Shalom Yosef Alshich Halevi, Eliyahu Yaakov Lag'imi, Yom Tov Yedid Halevi, Eliezer Halevi (Yom Tov’s son), Isaac Abadi, Isaac Shrem, Yaakov Lopas, Suliman Eliyahu, Yehuda Fatiyah, Yaakov Chaim Sofer, Eliyahu Moshe Ma’aravi, Haim Ben Sa’adia, Shlomo Mashiach, and many more. Some of these kabbalists even entered into a writ of allegiance obligating them to pray in the same place every day as per the RaShaSh’s intentions and to occupy them-selves with Talmudic studies.54With Rehovot haNahar’s establishment and the standardization of its nu-merous activities, it became the most important and vibrant kabbalah institu-tion in Jerusalem, accommodating tens of highly influential kabbalists. At the heart of the yeshiva’s enterprise stood the works of HaARI and the RaShaSh. Likewise, its regulars strove to enhance the discipline of praying with inten-tion. Yeshaya Asher Zelig (RYA Z) Margaliot,55 who was on close terms with Rehovot haNahar’s sages, including its rosh yeshiva (see the discussion below), shed light on the daily routine at this seminary:53 For a discussion on why these kabbalists left Beit El, see Kassin, Sefer Pri Eṣ haGan, 26, 59; Sutton, Aleppo, 61–64; Hillel, Sefer ṿeShavta haAreṣ, 25–28, 68–71; idem, “The Life of Dweck-HaKohen,” 24–25.

Also see Hillel, Ahavat Shalom, 184–185; Giller, Shalom Shar’abi and the Kabbalists of Beit El, 71–73, 77. According to one eyewitness, Beit El’s sages recoiled from Dweck-HaKohen’s way, to the point of telling him that “The crown of pshat [the literal interpretation] is enough for you; leave the crown of kabbalah for your superiors;” Laniado, “The Elder of the Kabbalists,” 3.54 Sutton, Aleppo, 63, 413–414; Hillel, “The Life of Dweck-HaKohen,” 28–30.

And there were those among them who studied with Torah scholars who came there to the holy yeshiva to learn the wisdom of the kabbalah from them; all night it would shine like the day until the first light; and when dawn broke they wrapped and adorned themselves with a tallit and tefillin of Rashi and Rabbeinu Tam together.

Needless to say, Dweck-HaKohen left his mark on this entire enterprise. Besides his tikkun-im literature (a corpus that will be expanded on in Chapter 6), Dweck-HaKohen was a prolific annotator of HaARI and the RaShaSh’s works. In addition, he took pains to reconcile the contradictions between their thought in a succinct and penetrating manner.58 His magnum opus, Eifa Shlema, which includes comments on Sefer Oṣrot Ḥayim, came out in Jerusalem in 1907. Affixed to this book are words of praise for those studying kabbalah.59 What is more, Dweck-HaKohen annotated and helped publish several kabbalah books by sages from Baghdad and Aleppo, including the following: Nissim Harari, Sefer Alei Nahar (1903);60 Sasson ben Mordechai Moses Shinduch, Sefer Sdeh Lavan (1904);61 57 Margaliot, Zvi for the Righteous, introduction, 28.

In the in-troduction, the book’s release is tied to the founding of Rehovot haNahar:And on the occasion that a new house of worship has been established within the holy society of Rehovot in the holy community of ha’buḥaralia [Little Bukhara]; and regulars in the said house of worship are rabbis studying the wisdom of truth in matters of utmost importance – pure ut-terances, and their soul wished to drink the waters of the spring of living water, [namely] to release a commentary on the Pri Eṣ Hayyim presented in this book.64Moreover, the revered kabbalist noted that the book’s publishers also possess a number of responsa concerning Jewish mysticism: the second part of Eli-yahu Mishan’s Darkei Emet; a collection by Moshe Sweid; and a kabbalistic re-sponsum from the pen of Dweck-HaKohen. However, Rehovot haNahar’s sages never managed to publish these books, as they remained in manuscript form for over half a century. In approximately 1910, Dweck-HaKohen also edited and put out Emet me’Aram Ṣoba, a book by his grandfather.65 Last but not least, he helped publish the Jewish-Arabic translation of Eliyahu HaKohen of Izmir’s Shevet Musar in 1921.66Seventeen years later, in 1938, Moshe David Gaon summed up the figure of Dweck-HaKohen: “In isolation and privation throughout his days this kabbal-istic rabbi was estranged and remote from his surroundings, and all that comes into existence outside the kabbalah’s purview did not concern him whatso-ever, and was unlikely to distract him from the progression of his thoughts on 62 Mishan, S’fat Emet, printed on behalf of the Rehovot haNahar Yeshiva.

On these and others matters, Rehovot ha-Nahar’s sages were cut from the same cloth as Margaliot and his fellow Hasids-cum-kabbalists. For instance, they opposed all the new and secular trends that were reaching Jerusalem and other Jewish communities. Margaliot indeed at-tempted to enlist the Sephardic kabbalists for some of his reactionary Orthodox battles. The signatures of the yeshiva’s rabbis, foremost among them Dweck-HaKohen’s, figure prominently on manifestos and letters that were circulated throughout the city on topics like modesty, education, and the independence of the yeshivot within Jewish society.68 Be that as it may, Dweck-HaKohen ap-parently displayed an enthusiastic attitude towards Zionism. Isaiah Shapira, “the pioneer-rebbe,” came away with the following insights from a visit to Re-hovot haNahar circa 1931: “In the development of the Yishuv in recent years he [i.e., Dweck-HaKohen] saw the buds of the redemption, for you indeed ‘have no end from an exile from the fact’ that the words of the prophet are beginning to be fulfilled, ‘But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people of Israel.’” On the other hand, Dweck-HaKo-hen bemoaned the fact that the Jewish resettlement of the Land was not being carried out in strict conformity to Halakha.69 Similar observations were made by Moshe David Laniado soon after Dweck-HaKohen’s passing:He [Dweck-HaKohen] saw in the new settlement and the return to Zion “the bells of the Messiah and the arousal from below to the redemp-tion above.” In the development of the construction and the planting 67 Gaon, Oriental Jews, vol. 2, 215.68 For example, Margaliot and his ilk called upon their followers to resign from Knesset Yisrael (the umbrella organization for Jews in Mandatory Palestine). Moreover, he was vehemently opposed to female suffrage, endorsed bans against modern education and secular schools, protested against immodest dress, and clamored for segregation between the sexes in crowded places. In 1926, Mordecai Atiyah printed Jacob Halevi Lipschitz’s Makhzikei haDat (Upkeepers of the Faith), the proceeds from which were earmarked for the Rehovot haNahar Yeshiva. Dweck-HaKohen added a letter of recommendation to this work.

More specifically, kabbal-ists from all the Jewish ethnic groups paid courtesy calls to the seminary and were in touch with Dweck-HaKohen, who a few of his contemporaries dubbed “the elder of the kabbalists in Jerusalem” and “saba de’mishpattim.”71 Accord-ing to one source, “Many have said that there is a spark of HaARI in him.”72 Dweck-HaKohen, as Gaon observed, “is deemed to be the rabbi and teacher of the majority of the mekhavvnim in Jerusalem, both Sephardic and Ashkenazic alike.”73 From as far back as 1931, Shapira offered a similar description in the Hebrew press: “All the kabbalists in Jerusalem, both Sephardic and Ashkenazic alike, rise early to his gate and partake of his waters. If they come across a com-plex issue in the wisdom of the truth, they will come to Dweck-HaKohen and subscribe to his view.”74A medley of wondrous stories has been concocted around the unique figure of Dweck-HaKohen. Many of these tales pertain to the blindness that he was stricken with during his final years, which did not prevent him from tending to kabbalah matters, praying with intention, or publishing books (with the aid of a few students). What is more, the rabbi continued to serve as a cantor in the yeshiva. Blessed with a remarkable memory, he was a reservoir of Talmudic knowledge.75 Gaon testified that when leading prayer services, for example, 70 Laniado, “The Elder of the Kabbalists,” 3.71 The title “elder of the kabbalists” stuck to him as early as 1928 in “Modaʻa ṿeAzhara” (plac-ard). In 1931, an observer wrote that “The rabbi R. Shaul Dweck-HaKohen is one of the most beloved of the sages in Jerusalem, a figure wrapped in mystery and riddles, like one of the hidden saints of previous generations. He is deemed to be the elder of the kabbal-ists that are in Jerusalem.” Shapira, “The Elder of the Kabbalists,” 6.

Ac-cording to a 1931 piece in a local Jerusalem newspaper, “He is also famous as a miracle worker. He writes amulets and gives folk remedies and many come to him to ask for a blessing.”77 Lastly, there are reports that Dweck-HaKohen exor-cized a dybbuk (i.e., evil spirit) on one of his trips to Tiberias.78Dweck-HaKohen was also perceived as a gifted instructor in all that con-cerns praying with intention, as many students in Jerusalem and beyond learned the secrets of the trade from him. A fine illustration of this skill turns up at the outset of Eliyahu Moshe Ma’aravi’s 1924 book:From the day I stood by my own opinions, this was my passion to edify my worship of God and religious life; and upon ascending the mountain to Jerusalem i found that which my soul loved: rabbis holding forth in the Dweck-HaKohen adapted books with tikkunim and subsequently brought them to press. Other copies of his original writings, responsa, and annotations were compiled by Jacob S. Kassin, Rachamim Shrem, Yaakov Yosef Munseh, Eliyahu Moshe Ma’aravi, Suliman Eli-yahu, and RYA Z Margaliot.76 Gaon, Oriental Jews, vol. 2, 215. Cf. Laniado’s account from 1935: “And despite the fact that he was destitute of vision for approximately 20 years, he nevertheless did not forget any-thing from his learnings; and on the High Holidays he would pray from memory before hundreds of his students who would wallow in the dust of his feet [and] partake from his waters with tremendous devotion according to the kavvanot.” Laniado, “The Elder of the Kabbalists,” 3.77 Shapira, “The Elder of the Kabbalists,” 6; Laniado, “The Elder of the Kabbalists,” 3.

As an aside, he claimed that Sharabi appeared before Shalom Zofiof in a dream and agreed to pray for his convalescence, “especially because he is among those studying the kabbalah the way it should be, and prays from the RaShaSh’s siddur.”81Among those who lionized Dweck-HaKohen as the bequeather of kavvanot to the next generation were RYA Z Margaliot and the kabbalists of the Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva. Their interest in Sharabi’s kavvanot was encouraged by Dweck-HaKohen and his ilk at Rehovot haNahar. In 1931, the Jerusalem press reported that “Among the Ashkenazim there were quite a few immigrants from Poland who took shelter under Dweck-HaKohen’s shadow; for with their immi-gration here in recent years, they severed themselves from the courts of the Ha-sidic rebbes, in the dust of whose feet they wallowed all the days of their life.”82Despite the generous support from Nissim Nahum and the Bukharan com-munity in Jerusalem, Rehovot haNahar ran into financial difficulties in the midst of the First World War. Consequently, it issued several kolot kor’im (calls for submission) to drum up support. One of the flyers that the yeshiva printed out in Hebrew, English, and Yiddish was titled “The Holy Yeshiva of Rehovot haNahar of the Holy Community of Mekhavvnim may God Protect and Invigo-rate them” (the English version reads “The Holy Cabbalah College ‘Rehoboth Hanahar’ at Jerusalem University to Study Cabbalah [sic]”). According to this pamphlet, the yeshiva’s “goal is to disseminate the Torah of truth the wisdom of kabbalah among the sages of all the ethnic communities without any dif-ference and to pray according to the intention.” Since the institution’s estab-lishment, the document boasts, kabbalists of every stripe have flowed to its doorstep, learnt the works of Luria and Sharabi, and improved their knowledge of the kavvanot. In return for donations, the kabbalists will pray for the patron’s wellbeing at the Western Wall and the rest of Palestine’s holy sites. The flyer 80 Kassin, Sefer Pri Eṣ haGan, 58–59. Also see Hillel, “The Life of Kassin,” 35, 74–83.81 Hillel, “The Life of Kassin,” 53–54. Later on, Kassin received a strange honorary degree from Yeshivat Gan HaLevanon that was formulated in English: “February 2, 1942. This is to certify that our Holy College and Yeshivah, hereby confers upon the great and learned Rabbi-Rabbi Jacob S. Kassin, the Honorary Degree of Doctor and Magistrate in the science of Kabbalah and the Philosophical culture connected therewith and entailed therein, all in accordance with and pursuant to the methods adopted by our great and illustrious Rabbis – known as Ari and Rashash.” Ibid, 106.82 Shapira, “The Elder of the Kabbalists,” 6."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"chapter 250<UN>also enumerates the kabbalists’ prayers and their various tikkunim on behalf of the donors. It also bears noting that the wording of the three editions is un-identical. In the Yiddish and English pamphlets, say, the seminary’s kabbalists are said to have perfect attributes and are described as thaumaturges who dis-pense powerful amulets, remedies, and talisman.83 Another fundraising bro-chure is addressed to “our brethren the holy community of the sons of Aram Ṣoba from their brothers dwelling in Jerusalem.” Unlike the rest of the city’s yeshivot, the document claims, Rehovot haNahar has neither special rabbini-cal emissaries nor charity boxes throughout the world. Consequently, readers are exhorted to set up such receptacles and loosen their purse strings.84 By around 1923, the institution’s persistent budget woes led some of its resident kabbalists to transfer to the Oz veHadar Yeshiva (discussed at length below), whose fellows were granted accommodations and a regular monthly stipend.85 Rabbinical envoys were subsequently dispatched on Rehovot haNahar’s be-half, and they apparently managed to shore up its finances. For instance, Mar-galiot was sent to Damascus in around 1924, and Kassin evidently raised funds in America.86 The next year the yeshiva printed “A General and Private State-ment of Income and Expenditure” for its regular contributors.87 At any rate, the seminary’s financial hardships did not prevent most of Jerusalem’s kab-balah practitioners from convening under its roof thanks to the exceptional personality of its leader.

After the war, the yeshiva renewed its operations and even increased the number of students. In 1923, some eighty percent of the students moved to the Porat Yosef Yeshiva, which opened that year in Jerusalem from the funds of the patron Shalom of Calcutta. This seminary attracted many of Rehovot haNahar’s students, who were probably lured by the chances for a bigger stipend thanks to the fruit of a permanent fund. However, the rabbi C.S. Dweck brought several new students to the yeshiva, from the nearby lands of the East, and he continued to sustain the yeshiva with the backing of the above-mentioned rabbi Nissim Nahum.” Rehovot haNahar Yeshiva, Report, 1938 (ms).86 Margaliot, Azamer beShvakhin, 47–50 (the author provides a photograph of his emissary letter).

This was the case for the rabbis of Oz veHadar, which was housed in the Porat Yosef Seminary.89 The latter was established in 1923 with funds from the trust and estate of one Yosef Avraham Shalom; among the richest men in Iraq, by that time he was living in India.90 Over the years, Porat Yosef produced a long list of famous rabbis. From its very incep-tion, the yeshiva set aside room for those learning kabbalah and established a rich library stocked with relevant material. It also built a kabbalistic syna-gogue in which worshippers prayed according to the RaShaSh’s kavvanot. In addition, the institution’s resident kabbalists received living quarters.91 Some of its regulars had transferred from Rehovot haNahar, which could not pro-vide fixed support. Oz veHadar’s first two head rabbis were Suliman Eliyahu of Baghdad (1879–1940)92 and Ephraim Cohen Zilkha of Baghdad ( 1885–1957).93 Among the habitués at Porat Yosef was Ben-Zion Mordechai Hazan of Baghdad 88 Mutzafi, Olamo shel Ṣadiq, 85.

With Dweck-HaKohen’s passing, they splintered off and took up residence in various institutions. While Dweck-HaKohen was still alive, a quasi-branch of Rehovot haNahar, by the name of Gan haLeva-non (Garden of the Lebanon), was founded by R. Jacob S. Kassin (1900–1994). Reared in Porat Yosef, Kassin married the daughter of the Beit El kabbalist Sha-lom Hedaya. From 1933 onwards, he lived in New York, where he taught Jewish mysticism to a select few. Gan haLevanon operated from approximately 1923 to 1931. Between these years, it put out a couple of books on the RaShaSh’s kav-vanot, in the spirit and with the consent of Dweck-HaKohen.97From 1933 to 1949, Rehovot haNahar was led by its founder’s son: Eliyahu Dweck-HaKohen.98 The seminary moved from the Bukharan Quarter to Maḥane Yehudah in around 1930. Thereafter, R. Eliyahu relocated the institution to his home in the Ruḥamah Neighborhood. In all likelihood, Rehovot haNahar’s stu-dent body diminished after the leadership succession in 1933, as quite a few of its habitués left for other yeshivot or new centers that had sprung up in Jerusa-lem during the 1930s and 1940s. That said, a nucleus of roughly ten kabbalists stayed under Eliyahu Dweck-HaKohen’s wing.99 In Rehovot haNahar’s official 94 Gaon, Oriental Jews, vol. 2, 247–248; Ben-Yaakov, A History of the Jews of Iraq, 373–374.

The pamphlet, ShaHaDI baMromim, opens with a statement of purpose and exhortation:Dear honorable lord!

The above-cited letter inviting Gershom Scholem to the seminary in 1938 attests to how different the son was from his father.103 From this letter, it is evident that the former sought to “brand” the institution as a global center for kabbalistic enterprise. Atop its official letterhead, the ye-shiva was touted as “The Rehovot haNahar Center for Seekers of the Wisdom of the Kabbalah in Jerusalem (Anything Difficult shall be Brought Here).” More-over, R. Eliyahu assumed the same title that his father had merited years ear-lier: “Elder of the Kabbalists in Jerusalem.” A verse inscribed on the letterhead also alluded to the new man at the helm: “For the Cohen’s lips should preserve knowledge, and men should seek the law at his mouth (Malachi 2:7).”104 Other stationery bore the name “The Rehovot haNahar Institute for Questions, for Guidance, and for Instruction in the Wisdom of Kabbalah and a Center for To-rah and Prayer.” On one envelope, the son was referred to as “a spiritual leader for the community of kabbalists and the head of the Rehovot haNahar Insti-tute for Pursuing Kabbalah Wisdom.”105 In reality, though, few people looked up to Eliyahu Dweck-HaKohen and the yeshiva’s standing, financial and other-wise, was precarious.A fundraising drive to shore up the institution was undertaken in the late 1930s and early 1940s. As part of this initiative, the seminary’s top brass con-ducted a long correspondence with the Jewish National Council (from 1938 to 1940) and the American-Jewish Central Relief Committee (1938 to 1945), both of which supported a number of yeshivot in Jerusalem.

Instead, they sufficed with a visit to the “Bukharan Yeshiva” (i.e., Oz veHadar). “Upon hearing ‘explanations’ from strangers on the essence of the kabbalah and the like,” Moshe wrote, the Council’s envoy “frowned and took off. And at this point the question is asked How is it that you have come to embrace the Bukharan way of imbibing expla-nations that have nothing to do with us?”108 The secretary’s efforts apparently bore fruit. More specifically, a new official was dispatched to reassess the previ-ous findings, and a certain sum of money was eventually forwarded to Rehovot haNahar. Aside for summarizing Eliyahu Dweck-HaKohen’s version of the ye-shiva’s history, the new report explicates the institution’s gloomy present state and dearth of students.109R.

Among the tidbits of information that Moshe submitted that “The institution currently maintains, besides for the yeshiva for studying kabbalah which is found in a large room in the director’s house, also a synagogue for praying with intentions as per HaARI and the RaShaSh (this sort of prayer lasts about four hours). The synagogue is located in the home of Mrs. Hannah Banin on David Yellin Street near the yeshiva.

From the moment Uziel got on board, R. Eliyahu referred to himself in the yeshiva’s official correspondences as merely “the spiritual director.”110 The chief rabbi’s name indeed graces many of the seminary’s letters from 1939 and on. Uziel also wrote to the National Council about the dire straits that he found Rehovot ha-Nahar in towards the end of 1939 and to inform the organization of his decision to take part in its renewal:After visiting the aforementioned yeshiva, I hereby have the honor of informing you that there are ten Torah scholars here occupied with the hidden Torah and the esoteric wisdom under the supervision and man-agement of the rabbi and kabbalist R. Eliyahu Dweck-HaKohen, and they are holding the last spark of the kabbalists. I have decided to take upon myself the care of this important institution in all that concerns admin-istrative and financial matters and am thinking about expanding the number of its students and to improve the study methods for the sake of preserving in our midst the source of natural light of the brilliant period from the bygone kabbalists’ lives.111Uziel’s decision to champion Rehovot haNahar’s cause is surprising in several respects. Above all, he was not heretofore a public advocate of Jewish mysti-cism. In addition, there is no evidence that he openly practiced kabbalah or that it had any influence on his thought. The chief rabbi’s report as to R. Eli-yahu’s small coterie harboring “the last spark of the kabbalists” was not only an exaggeration, but completely ignored what was transpiring in the Jerusalem kabbalah scene at the time. Therefore, we can assume that this hyperbole was intended to rustle up more generous support. A letter that Uziel addressed to the National Council in 1940 reveals that he had grander plans for Rehovot haNahar:It behooves me to inform you that when I took upon myself the presi-dency of the above-mentioned yeshiva, I did not plan on continuing with the same dismal format like it is, but my aspiration was and always will be to expand it and aggrandize it, by injecting it with young and fresh forces so that the esoteric wisdom of the Jewish people shall not 110 Eliyahu Dweck-HaKohen, Letter to the National Council, 1939 (ms).111 Uziel, Letter to the National Council in Palestine, 1939 (ms)."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"57The Kabbalah Seminaries Of Jerusalem<UN>be forgotten. However, the means that have been placed in my hands over these months since receiving the presidency were very meager and I still have not managed to acquire enough friends and lovers for this Toranic institution to bring it to the lofty point to which I aspire.... I hereby ask of you to be so kind as to give a superlative recommendation for the Rehovot haNahar Yeshiva and its director, the aforementioned honorable rabbi [Eliyahu Dweck-HaKohen] and to exert influence in the necessary places, so that they will extend them the requisite maximum assistance and give [us] the opportunity to upgrade this institution as befits it.112Uziel’s salvo of letters paid dividends, as the Central Relief Committee and Na-tional Council agreed to sustain the yeshiva at current levels.For some time, Rehovot haNahar’s habitués regularly studied at the chief rabbi’s yeshiva, Sha’arei Ṣion, in the hopes that this step would bolster the kab-balah institution’s status and attract more students.113 However, it seems that Uziel’s intensive efforts on the seminary’s behalf slowed down by 1940. During that year, Rehovot haNahar’s sextons, activists, and leaders once again began to complain about their troubles. The chief rabbi continued to press an as-sortment of philanthropic organizations to assist the yeshiva, but was unable to fully implement his plans. Likewise, Uziel’s attempts to reconcile between R. Eliyahu and his father’s disciples who had gradually left the yeshiva came to naught.114Given the dearth of full-time students and the Relief Committee’s subse-quent decision to cease its permanent support, Rehovot haNahar’s troubles mounted. As Eitan haEzrahi reported in a letter from around this time, “Rabbi Eliyahu Dweck-HaKohen, who has become completely destitute of vision, has been forced to close the Rehovot haNahar Yeshiva whose students have joined the other Sephardic seminaries in Jerusalem, like Porat Yosef. Never-theless, Sephardic and Ashkenazic rabbis continue to go early in the morning and stay late at night at Rabbi Eliyahu’s doorstep to receive instruction and guidance in all the difficult questions regarding the wisdom of the kabbalah and Talmud.” HaEzrahi also divulged that the seminary was conducting nego-tiations with Yaakov Halberstam, the grand rebbe of Sanz and the rosh yeshiva of the Darkei Ḥaim Yeshiva in Jerusalem. According to the tentative terms, Halberstam would see to it that Ashkenazic kabbalists attend daily services at 112 Uziel, Letter to Chaim Yefet, the National Council, 1940 (ms).113 Rehovot haNahar Yeshiva, Exchange of Letters with Uziel, 1939–1940 (ms).114 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"chapter 258<UN>R. Eliyahu’s house, thereby ensuring a minyan. Moreover, the grand rabbi would handle Rehovot haNahar’s technical and administrative affairs. The talks nearly panned out, but R. Eliyahu’s poor health ultimately scuttled the deal.115 In parallel, the yeshiva distributed a flyer promising donors “a great talisman for redemption and success,” which was allegedly fashioned by the es-teemed Hasid R. Levi Yitzchok of Berditchev.116 The National Council did con-tinue to support the yeshiva in a sporadic fashion and even sent it books on an ad hoc basis. However, this largess would not suffice to solve the yeshiva’s main problem, namely an inadequate number of students to justify its existence.Not all the remaining habitués left R. Eliyahu the moment he lost his vi-sion. In fact, some even remained after it dawned upon them that the yeshiva was incapable of providing for their livelihood. The majority, though, took off either immediately or soon after his father’s death. In 1933, a large group of Chaim Shaul Dweck-HaKohen’s disciples established a kabbalistic synagogue and seminary in the Bukharan Quarter by the name of Emet veShalom (Truth and Peace). At first, they sought to retain the name Rehovot haNahar, but R. Eliyahu took legal measures to thwart this plan.117 In any case, the new yeshiva essentially adopted the same format and traditions of Rehovot haNahar at its peak.One of Emet veShalom’s fundraising pamphlets was almost an exact replica of the aforementioned trilingual flyer. In appropriating this text, the praise for Rehovot haNahar during Chaim Shaul Dweck-HaKohen’s lifetime was project-ed onto the new seminary. The opening sentence in the original declaration, which pertains to the establishment of Rehovot haNahar, was replaced with the following words: “This notice stating that here in the holy city of Jerusalem was established in the year 5656 [ca. 1896] the holy yeshiva of the kabbalists and it has now been renewed under the name Emet veShalom in the holy com-munity of the mekhavvnim may it be built on justice.” Aside for this sentence, the only other discrepancies between the two documents are the name, the picture at the top, and the list of signatories, some of whom also appear on the 115 HaEzrahi, Letter, undated (ms).116 Rehovot haNahar, Qupat Eliyahu haNavi, undated (ms).117 In 1940, R. Eliyahu described the immediate aftermath of his father’s passing: “Wretched days came upon the yeshiva; many of the students left it and even sought to use the name Rehovot haNahar in order to raise funds for another yeshiva. However, under the pressure of legal measures that the founder’s son, Eliyahu HaKohen Dweck, the present director, wielded against them they were compelled to surrender the name Rehovot haNahar and called themselves by the name of the Emet veShalom Yeshiva – (today this institution is no longer in existence).” Rehovot haNahar, Report, 1938 (ms)."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"59The Kabbalah Seminaries Of Jerusalem<UN>first.118 Affirming the new declaration are several of the era’s most important kabbalists who had hitherto been overshadowed by the elder Dweck-HaKohen: Yaakov Chaim Sofer, Eliyahu Moshe Ma’aravi, Abraham Salam, Yechezkel Ezra Yehoshua haLevi, Haim Cohen Traub, Shalom Yosef Alshich Halevi, Refael Me-nachem Ma’aravi, and Shlomo Mashiach. Given all that the two institutions held in common, Emet veShalom’s rabbis felt compelled to print another no-tice declaring that since Rehovot haNahar moved to Maḥane Yehudah, they have not received any support from it. Moreover, according to the new placard, every other declaration in Emet veShalom’s name was a forgery. Last but not least, it proclaims that the signatories adhere to all the practices that were ob-served during the revered kabbalist’s lifetime.119As of 1936, Emet veShalom was led by R. Chaim Shaul Dweck-HaKohen’s loyal disciple Yaakov ben Yosef Rofeh Munseh of Damascus (1877–1944).120 Legend has it that when Munseh came to Jerusalem in 1919, R. Hayyim Vital ap-peared before Dweck-HaKohen in a dream and warned him “to honor Yaakov our Patriarch.” From that point on, the rosh yeshiva entrusted the new student with mysteries of wisdom, for “his soul was worthy” thereof. For his part, Mun-seh did not budge from Rehovot haNahar.121 He also persuaded many of the city’s Jews to study kabbalah. As part of his campaign to promote Jewish mys-ticsm, Munseh offered “recruits” prayer pamphlets, tikkunim, and talisman. In fact, he had a reputation for concocting potent amulets. Some of his handouts (especially the numerous flyers that he distributed on general tikkunim) were equipped with flashy titles: “A Closely Guarded Secret,” “A Talisman from a Pre-cious Old Kabbalistic Tool Passed on from Person to Person back to Moses Our Rabbi;” and “Talisman from HaARI,” etc.122 Furthermore, he copied a fair share 118 Emet veShalom Yeshiva, Call for Aid; cf.

This notice was also re-printed in the newspaper Doar haYom (1933).120 A native of Damascus, Munseh reached Jerusalem ca. 1919 and became Dweck-HaKohen’s student. He was a resident scholar at Yagdil Torah, Rehovot haNahar, and Emet Shalom, settling down in the latter from 1936 onwards.

In many of his letters, R. Eliyahu excoriated Munseh and the rest of the students that had left the yeshiva upon his father’s demise.124 Accord-ing to Moshe Dweck-HaKohen, the head of the rival seminary also had some choice words about the Rehovot haNahar leadership, both past and present. The former recollects a conversation in which Munseh resorted to excessive braggadocio:If he [i.e., Uziel] is the Sephardic chief rabbi, in Damascus I would sit in a chair studded with precious stones and all the people that came calling would not believe they were fortunate enough to reach me in order to kiss my hand and adorn me with coins. I would occasionally explain not only to your father [R. Eliyahu] but to your grandfather R. Shaul himself kabbalah passages that everyone had a hard time interpreting. They say about your father that the Torah lights a fire underneath him? You should know that he does not have even one percent of what I have! And he [i.e., Munseh] then slammed on the table.125At about this time, a group began to coalesce around R. Yehuda Fetayah of Baghdad (1859–1942), who had taken up permanent residence in Jerusalem circa 1934. He too had been on close terms with R. Chaim Shaul, helping him, inter alia, prepare manuscripts of his works.126 Fetayah built quite a name for 247–248.

See idem, ’Olamo shel Ṣadiq; Gilkrov, He’ir haMizrakh, vol. 2, 1–51.124 For instance, according to R. Eliyahu, those who left the seminary after his father’s passing were “ungrateful destructive elements who held jobs in Damascus and only in the year 1923 with the opening of the Porat Yosef Seminary (and there was a shortage of students) we brought them from behind the cattle to shepherd in God’s law and we withheld from our own mouth and gave them. These provocative elements will not have a foothold in my yeshiva and in the father’s lifework, room will not be given except to quiet and productive forces.” Eliyahu Dweck-HaKohen, Letter to Uziel, 1940 (ms).125 Rehovot haNahar Yeshiva, Exchange of Letters with Uziel, 1939–1940 (ms).126 For more on Fetayah, see Moshe, Sefer Qeṣ haYamin, 47–50; Mutzafi, “Introduction;” Co-hen, HaARI baMistarim, 47–60; Dvir, Ish meBeit Lehem Yehuda.

For instance, saints purportedly visited his dreams. Moreover, Fetayah was regarded as a proficient exorcist, and there was heavy demand for his remedies and amulets.127 Mysteries of the East and the Rebbe of MunkacsMany kabbalists in Jerusalem who arrived from both the East and West fully adopted Sharabi’s gospel, while others – be it in the Land of Israel or the Exile who reached the RaShaSh’s work in one way of the other – integrated his meth-ods into their own. A synthesis between Sharabian thought and East European Hasidism was already introduced in the late 1800s by Yaakov Meir Spielman.128 Among the kabbalists in the Land of Israel who subsequently combined the two approaches was Yeshaya Asher Zelig Margaliot – the aforementioned confi-dante of Dweck-HaKohen who was briefly affiliated with the Sha’ar haShamay-im Yeshiva. The feeling that the “secret” and “the true and pure” kabbalistic way was to be found in the RaShaSh’s thought and in the hands of his disciples motivated Eastern European Jews to fabricate tales according to which Hasids and kabbalists from their own extremities of the Diaspora were in contact with Sharabi. A case in point is myths whereby copies of a hand-written siddur by the RaShaSh himself found their way into the hands of various rebbes (see the discussion in Chapter 5). Similarly, kabbalists in Eastern Europe sought the “seal of approval” from their counterparts in Jerusalem, even when their re-spective approaches completely differed or were antithetical to one another.127 A case in point is Fetayah’s attempt to rectify the souls of Sabbatai Zvi and Nathan of Gaza. He viewed the latter as the author of Ḥemdat Yamim. Fetayah, Minḥat Yehuda, 1933 (also see the English translation; idem, Minḥat Yehuda, 2010).

His mentor, Shimon Agassi, also put an emphasis on dreams and exorcisms; idem, “Visions and Revelations of Elijah.”128 Spielman, Tal Orot, vol. 1, “Introduction,” 1b. Gershom Scholem made the following ob-servations in his personal copy of this work: “And it is a rather wonderful book and most interesting – a Hasidic-psychological interpretation of the words of the Maggid [Dov Ber of Mezeritch] is merged with the RaShaSh’s approach and Emek haMelekh! ! ! It is largely based on the b[ook] Sha’arei Gan Eden and merges a tradition of the Ba’al Shem Tov’s disciples with the disciples of R.

The intermediary behind this summit was Margaliot, whose descriptions of Shapira apparently caught the imagination of Rehovot haNahar’s head rabbi. The latter circulated a placard throughout the city informing the Yishuv that “the sage of the mys-teries is coming to town.” Consequently, “a sacred duty is imposed on all of Jerusalem’s learned and especially our members who are studying the wisdom of truth and those who are familiar with the concealed wisdom to give respect to the Torah by going to the train station to greet the face of the shekhinah [divine presence].”129 The rebbe’s scribe made certain that the Holy Land visit, not least the meeting with the venerated mystic, was well-documented. Above all, he spread the word of, their conversation in the holy tongue regarding the wisdom of Kabbalah. Moreover, the scribe provided colorful descriptions of Rehovot haNahar.130 For his part, Dweck-HaKohen asked Shapira to finan-cially strengthen the yeshiva – a request that was quickly fulfilled.131 It also bears noting that the two rabbis remained in touch via the post until around 1933 – a correspondence that produced several fascinating exchanges.132 One of Shapira’s missives refers to a dream that his correspondent shared with him. In this dream, Dweck-HaKohen was instructed to bore an opening through a 129 Rehovot haNahar and Margaliot, “The Sage of the Mysteries is Coming to Town” (placard), signed by Dweck-HaKohen. A photo of this document appears in Shimon Margaliot, Aza-mer beShavkhin, 78; Goldstein, Journey to Jerusalem, 70.130 Goldstein, Masa’ot Yerushalayim, 13b-14a, 31b-32a, 36a (also see the English translation: idem, Journey to Jerusalem, 70, 99–101). The primary motive behind this trip might have been a meeting with Solomon Eliezer Alfandari.131 For more on Shapira’s generous financial support to Rehovot haNahar and its rosh yeshiva, see Margaliot’s 1932 letter in idem, Azamer beShavkhin, 82. On account of his de-teriorating medical condition, Dweck-HaKohen was rushed to Shaare Zedek Hospital. In consequence, the rebbe of Munkacs quickly dispatched a letter to Dr. Moritz Moshe Wal-lach, the hospital’s director, urging him to keep a close eye on the prized patient; Shapira, “Two Epistles,” 58. According to one of his students, a blessing that Shapira received from Dweck-HaKohen right before the kabbalist’s passing left him feeling strengthened. The rebbe received these tidings in response to a “kvitel [small note asking for a rebbe’s inter-cession] and five hundred crowns” that he had forwarded to Dweck-HaKohen. Yitzhak Adler, Seder haShana haAḥrona, 140–141.132 For example, in a 1932 letter, Shapira crowns Dweck-HaKohen with bombastic titles, asks that the kabbalist pray on his and his family members’ behalf, and shares a novel kabbal-istic idea with him; Shapira, Shealot ṿeTshuvot Minḥat Elazar, vol. 5, §17, 9b-10a.

According to a tradition in Joseph Karo’s Maggid Meisharim, this custom had the power to end a draught and subsequently became a technique for averting all sorts of disasters.133 What is more, Margaliot depicted Dweck-HaKohen as a wonder worker not only for the Jews in the Land of Israel, but a grand rabbi who tends to requests from suppliants outside his bailiwick. For example, he recounted a wondrous incident that transpired in the 1920s:A written appeal came from overseas to the holy eminence, our teacher and rabbi the divine kabbalist Rabbi Chaim Shaul HaKohen Dweck that the governor of the city from nearby there [i.e., a Jewish community] is harassing the Jews quite a lot. And the holy rabbi[,] the righteous and saintly person of blessed memory, rode to Meiron for a Shabbat of slichot before Rosh Hashanah with twenty of his students, and me, the little one, with them; and we were there five days, and every day we did circuits around the holy gravestone of our distinguished forefathers with the four species of Sukkot from last year, in our hands; and when we returned to Jerusalem, the rabbi found a telegram in his house informing him that the city’s governor had suddenly died, and for the Jews there was radi-ance and joy.134Besides Margaliot, the regulars at Sha’ar haShamayim also helped build ties be-tween Dweck-HaKohen and kabbalists and Hasidim in Eastern Europe. More than all the others, though, it is the bond between the rabbi of Munkacs and Rehovot haNahar’s leading light that has spurred on interest in these relation-ships. The romantic belief among many Ashkenazic Jews that the “secret” was ensconced in the East was certainly one of the prime catalysts behind these ties. As we shall see in the ensuing chapter, though, the relationships were oc-casionally much more complicated.133 Ibid, 52–54.134 Shapira, Shealot ṿeTshuvot Minḥat Elazar, vol. 5, §16, 9b."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, ���6 | doi �0.��63/97890043��649_004<UN>chapter 3Merging Traditions: The Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva Criticism against the Sharabian MonopolyThe exclusivity of the RaShaSh’s way also drew criticism from some Jerusalem-based kabbalists who espoused different traditions or a new interpretive ap-proach These factors did not consider the Sharabian meditative prayer to be the center of the kabbalah world, nor did they view the RaShaSh’s writing to be the definitive and most accurate reading of the Lurianic mystical tradition. Upon acquainting himself with Jerusalem’s kabbalists in 1922, Yehuda Leib Ashlag (1885–1955) excoriated them for, above all, their meager comprehen-sion of the kabbalah’s inner meaning. More precisely, he asserted that they were clueless in all that concerns Lurianic knowledge. At the time, Jerusalem had several kabbalah centers, but the brunt of his criticism was apparently directed at the mekhavvnim that followed in Sharabi’s footsteps and interpret-ed HaARI’s kabbalistic works on this basis. Ashlag’s contentions turn up in a shelved introduction to one of his books:Upon finally meeting the most famous among them, namely people that had already spent their [best] years learning the works of HaARI and the Zohar and managed to acquaint themselves with HaARI’s books to the point of astonishment, I asked them if they had studied under a rabbi with an understanding of the inner nature of things, and they answered me – I am hesitant to remind you, there is no internalness save for the words as they are written [and] transmitted to us and nothing else. So I asked them if R. Hayyim Vital comprehended the inner nature of things, and they answered me – He certainly did not attain more than we do. I then asked them about HaARI himself, and they answered me – He cer-tainly did not know internalness any more than we do; and everything that he did know, he passed on to his disciple R. Hayyim Vital, and these [insights thus] reached our hands. In consequence, I laughed at them a great deal; for if this is so, how did the insights take shape in HaARI’s heart without any understanding and knowledge. And they answered me – the work of the things [i.e., the kabbalah wisdom] he received from the mouth of Elijah, and he knew the internalness because he was an angel."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"65Merging Traditions<UN>At this point, I released my frustration on them, for I had run out of pa-tience to stand next to them.1By this point in his life, Ashlag had already begun to develop his own unique interpretation of Luria’s works, which had a major impact on kabbalists in the second half of the 1900s. Moreover, he saw himself as the current receptacle of HaARI’s itinerant soul, so that his commentary was the final word on the distinguished rabbi’s gospel. Ashlag attracted a small yet loyal following. In around 1938, he established “beit ulpana rabata itur rabanim [the Ornament of Rabbis Great Seminary] for the Study and Dissemination of the Wisdom of Kabbalah in Jerusalem.” Operated out of Ashlag’s house, this outfit was basically a foundation for advancing the study of kabbalah and publishing the founder’s books, which diverged sharply from the Sharabian kabbalah.2R. Israel Abuhatzeira (the Baba Sali, 1889–1984), who earned quite a reputa-tion as a miracle worker in the State of Israel, is said to have voiced his own reservations concerning the RaShaSh’s approach to kabbalah during visits to Palestine in circa 1922 and 1933.3 Nevertheless, Abuhatzeira studied this brand of kabbalah while in Jerusalem with Eliyahu Yaakov Lag'imi (the aforemen-tioned sage who was affiliated with Beit El and Rehovot haNahar). In parallel, he took steps to publish the works of his brother David.4Shlomo Elyashiv (1841–1926), a respected kabbalist from Lithuania who provided his own take on HaARI’s gospel in Sefer Leshem Shevo ve-Aḥlamah, also raised concerns about the monopoly of the RaShaSh’s kabbalistic thought and the intention-oriented approach. Towards the end of his life (circa 1922), Elyashiv settled down in Jerusalem, where he formed bonds with circles of mekhavvnim.

Elyashiv even wrote an enthusiastic approval for one of the books on Sharabian intentions that came out under the yeshiva’s imprint.5 That said, he complained to one of his fellow kabbalists about the dominance of this method in Jerusalem:And herewith I will not withhold from my friend from offering before him some of what is on my heart. For I have seen with my own eyes that the greatest Sephardic rabbis hold that the gospel of our rabbi, R. Shalom the saint Sharabi is to the gospel of the holy HaARI as the approach of the oral Torah is to the written Torah. This is not my opinion. With respect to the words of the holy rabbi Shalom, I hereby say that they [i.e., the mekhavvnim] are indeed right that a few of his sacred words are founda-tions and principles in the depth of the gospel of HaARI without which it is impossible to discern the truth – overall, though, his way is [but] one dimension of the gospel of HaARI. And to the best of my knowledge it is also possible to suitably understand it in other lights as well, for there are several dimensions to the Torah and one mustn’t necessarily under-stand them exclusively according to his way in holiness even if his way in holiness is very very sharp and profound and not every brain compre-hends this and one can also understand it in a different, simpler, and less complicated manner as I determined and saw in a couple of places that God deigned to share with me.6A different line of reasoning was put forth by R. Avraham Weinberg (ii), the grand rabbi of the Slonimer Hasidism (1884–1933),7 who visited the Land of Israel – where his followers had set up communities – in 1929 and 1933. He unfurled his outlook on learning kabbalah before one of his disciples, who wished to advance “to a higher rung” of devotion by embracing the wisdom of kabbalah:5 Dweck-HaKohen and Lag'imi, Sefer Benayahu ben Yehoyada, vols. 1–2. Elyashiv also wrote annotations and footnotes for the RaShaSh’s works; Elyashiv, Sefer leShem shevo ve-Aḥlamah, an Explanation of the Words of Our Holy Rabbi Sharabi (1950).6 Levin, “Toldot haGaon haQadosh,” iii. For a close look at Elyashiv’s attitude towards the kabbalists in Jeruslaem, see Meir, “Wrestling with the Esoteric,” 602–604. Part of the problem that Ashlag, Elyashiv, and others had with the RaShaSh’s way is tied to sundry kabbalistic conceptions of allegory. Avivi discusses the two contrasting approaches to HaARI; idem, Kabbala Luriana, 3, 1052–1055.7 For more on Weinberg, see Rabinowitsch, Lithuanian Hassidism, 161–163; Piekarz, Ideological Trends of Hasidism in Poland, 75–76; Nadler, “Slonimer Hasidism,” 402, 410–411."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"67Merging Traditions<UN>And take this general rule in your hand, so that you will blossom to the sky; and by dint of this, you will not fall to the bottom of the nether-world – and the study of the Eṣ Ḥayyim in this generation is an effec-tive means to faith. You shall do as follows, start learning bit by bit and each and every hidden meaning adds up; and the main thing is that you should start each day off by studying Talmud with Rashi for about an hour, and thereafter you shall study kabbalah; and whether to learn in-depth or in simplicity is up to your desire, each according to his heart’s desire; and it seems to me that the crux of the matter is to study in a way that leads to action, namely that you will maximize the things that you are learning so as to place them in words of prayer or Torah. And it behooves you to study Sefer Sha’arei Gan Eden, including its arrange-ment of the prayers that is titled Kol Yaakov, and Sefer Shefah Tal, and Zohar with the commentary Mikdash Melekh.8In conclusion, Weinberg averred that the kabbalah is reserved for a select few, who are best-advised to accentuate the work methods, rather than the learning itself – an approach that informed the previous rebbes of his Hasidic court.9 The “Slonimer way” runs counter to that of Jerusalem’s kabbalists, some of whom Weinberg presumably met on his visits to the Land of Israel. In another letter to that same Hasid (the content of which was expurgated by the book’s editor), the grand rabbi strengthened his case:As hinted to you in my previous letter, it’s all in the worship of God. For the sake of not reaching this point, you must avail yourself of Torah scholars a lot [sic], and writings: the books of the holy rabbi [Yisrael] from Kozhnitz, Avodat Yisrael, the commentary on Tikunei haZohar, and Nezer Yisrael on the Zohar is alluded to a lot; that said all the books of the Ba’al Shem Tov’s disciples goes [sic] on this point, but there are books 8 Weinberg, Beit Avraham, 277, letter 36. This epistle is missing from the book’s first editions.9 Be that as it may, there are researchers who posit that kabbalah played a minimal role in this Hasidic court. See Nadler, “Slonimer Hasidism,” 395–415. Even if kabbalah studies were not an official part of the Slonimer yeshivot’ curriculum, the court always had a few mem-bers who immersed themselves in this literature and were deemed to be kabbalists, such as Moshe Midner, the mashgiaḥ (spiritual supervisor) of Weinberg’s seminary, and R. Aharon Yosef Luria (1894–1969), among the important Slonimer Hasids in Tiberias. This trend dates back to R. Avraham Weinberg (i) of Slonim (1804–1883), who wrote a book on kabbalistic matters (Ḥesed le’Avraham). As per the author’s wishes, only a limited number of copies were disseminated. In contrast, Weinberg’s Yesod haAvodah merited a larger distribution and was indeed more popular. Targeting a wider audience, kabbalistic topics are understated therein."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"chapter 368<UN>that raise heads etc., and there are books that went into the depths of the kabbalah and then the way of Hasidism; and the above-mentioned books appear, if I may say so, to indeed be the things that have put the worship of God before wisdom; and on this matter I hinted to you that you should see everything as coming from the arrangement of worship of God; for I have seen the kabbalah’s proponents in Eretz Yisrael... It could very well be that in all that concerns the kabbalah they are more proficient than [their counterparts in the Diaspora], but the true path is the way of the Ba’al Shem Tov of blessed memory, and the Ba’al Shem Tov’s commentary on the words of HaARI is to bring the wisdom to this enterprise.10Save for R. Aharon Roth and Rabbi Alfandari, there is no evidence of who Weinberg met with in Palestine.11 However, his argument against Jerusalem’s kabbalists is tied to their eschewal of the Ba’al Shem Tov’s approach, on the one hand, and their emphasis on theoretical studies and specific technical prayers, on the other. In the event that Weinberg also paid a visit to Rehovot haNahar Yeshiva, his criticism may be aimed at Dweck-HaKohen and his acolytes.12The well-known mystic Hillel Zeitlin (1871–1942) reproached Jerusalem’s kabbalists for ignoring the later Hasidic methods, especially that of Chabad and Bratsalv. Moreover, he was troubled by the lack of unity among the kab-balists in the Land of Israel. In Zeitlin’s estimation, this state of affairs was hindering the redemption.13 As we shall see, though, the cooperation between Jerusalem’s kabbalists was actually greater than the dissension. In short, he did not view the RaShaSh’s gospel to be a solution for the precarious situation of Eastern Europe Jewry at the time. Consequently, he began to formulate his own messianic vision, which drew heavily on Jewish mystical literature.14In essence, these critical views of the Sharabian approach represent differ-ent kabbalistic schools of thought, with proponents in Jerusalem and beyond. At any rate, each group was forced to contend with the RaShaSh’s legacy, which has long prevailed in Jerusalem. Perhaps one of the more riveting develop-ments in Jerusalem during these same years was the adoption of the Sharabian way by Ashkenazic kabbalists who were products of the Lithuanian Talmudic 10 Weinberg, Beit Avraham, 278, letter 37.11 Albert, “Visit to Eretz Ysrael,” 46–48; Schwartzman, Sefer Yehi Or, 351.12 For an account of such a meeting, see Pozailov, Great Rabbis of Syria and Lebanon, 156. However, there is no trustworthy source on this presumed encounter.13 Meir, “Wrestling with the Esoteric,” 612–615.14 Meir, Rabbi Nahman of Bratslav, 10–39; idem, “Hillel Zeitlin’s Zohar,” 119–157; idem, “The Book of Visions,” 149–171."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"69Merging Traditions<UN>system or Hasidic courts. This phenomenon, which is exemplified by the Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva, not only involved the transition of ideas to kabbalists who were reared in other traditions, but also contained the first buds of a merger between the RaShaSh’s tradition, kabbalah schools other than Beit El and Rehovot haNahar, and new methods that were introduced during these years. The Beginnings of Sha’ar haShamayimUnlike Rehovot haNahar, Sha’ar haShamayim was not an offshoot of the Beit El Yeshiva. Sha’ar haShamayim was established in 1906 by a few kabbalists who had operated outside the borders of a permanent beit midrash, even if they were close in spirit to the venerable institution. The new seminary was not the by-product of an ideological or interpretive dispute over the ascendant kabbalistic method in Jerusalem, but took root thanks to a small number of kabbalists (mostly Ashkenazim) who aspired to forge a new organizational structure, mode of study, and outreach apparatus. In fact, Sha’ar haShamayim continued the local practice of studying HaARI’s works and praying in accor-dance to the RaShaSh’s intentions. However, the fact that most of its regulars were Ashkenazim was a novelty. Its “student body” was indeed required to “adopt” a path that was unfamiliar to most Eastern Europeans. This Ashkenazi anomaly might explain why Sha’ar haShamayim underscored its cooperation with the more established kabbalah seminaries as well as its detailed curricu-lum. In any event, the emergent institution also had special departments that set it apart from its senior counterparts.Sha’ar haShamayim’s head rabbis were Shimon Zvi Horowitz of Lida and Chaim Yehuda Leib Auerbach. The former, also known as Shimon Lider and Shimon the Kabbalist (1869–1946), was a non-Hasidic Jew who began spread-ing the kabbalah at the turn of the century, distributing various booklets and teaching the concealed Torah to individuals and groups.15 The scion of a Hasidic Polish family, Auerbach (1883–1954), was born in Jaffa and married into the respected Porush family. He oversaw the seminary’s programs in Halakhic 15 For more on this kabbalist, see Malachi, “R. Shimon Zvi Horowitz;” 330–331; Meir, “The Eclectic Kabbalah,” 411–420; Tidhar, Encyclopedia of the Pioneers, vol. 1, 334. According to Tidhar, Horowitz died on the 2nd of Tishrei 5707 (1946) in Motza (a village west of Jerusa-lem), where he would seclude himself every Rosh Hashanah. Dablitski offers an account of his passing and funeral; idem, Binu Shnot Dor vaDor, 69–70."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"chapter 370<UN>literature, which was indeed his main area of interest.16 Sha’ar haShamayim’s establishment was facilitated by the broad support of rabbis and kabbalists from diverse backgrounds. In 1927, Auerbach reminisced over its nascent stages:The virtue of my forefathers stood to my benefit to establish the holy yeshiva Sha’ar Shamayim for the study of the true wisdom of Kabbalah, which owing to our many sins was nearly abandoned in our generation, an orphaned generation; and I was still young in days, less than the age of liability; and I enlisted the renowned kabbalist, the lord of secrets, Shimon Zvi Horowitz, and I appointed him the rosh yeshiva of the holy seminary to teach kabbalah; and from day to day, the number of students gradually multiplied; they are god-fearing and well-rounded Torah scholars among the illustrious of the Jews, and many of them developed and succeeded and also made [sic] fruit in studying the holy Torah; and among them were those who entered the orchard of supreme wisdom, through the inner gate, the mysteries of Torah, and the secrets in the prayer inten-tions according to the kabbalah of HaARI, and they commenced with this work – praying with the holy siddur of the RaShaSh.17In essence, Horowitz’s arrival set the yeshiva on its unique path. Born in Lida to a family of mitnagdim, he reportedly began studying kabbalah as a teen-ager from books that he found at the Strashun Library in Vilnius. Horowitz reached Palestine in 1887, before turning twenty, where he studied at the Eṣ Ḥayyim Yeshiva and apparently Beit El during the tenure of R. Sasson ben Moshe.18 In 1895, while enrolled at Eṣ Ḥayyim, he lent his signature to a notice, which was published in the newspaper HaBazeleth expressing support for a couple of the seminary’s students, Yehiel Michel Pines and Ze’ev Yavetz, “on the matter of settling the Holy Land by working the soil in adherence to the pure sanctity of Jerusalem’s denizens.”19 During this period, Horowitz was already engrossed in kabbalah studies. According to one eyewitness, he pressed the young students at Eṣ Ḥayyim to take up Jewish mysticism, albeit 16 Biographical information on this figure is provided by Bath Yehudah, “Auerbach,” 45–47; Tidhar, Encyclopedia of the Pioneers, vol. 3, 1470. One of his sons was the influential Halakhic adjudicator Zalman Auerbach.17 Auerbach, Sefer Ḥakham Lev, 1.18 For more on Sasson ben Moshe, see Tidhar, Encyclopedia of the Pioneers, vol. 1, 334.19 “Ma’asef leKol haMaḥanot,” 211–212. Horowitz is one of the signatories. See Malachi, Studies in the History of the Old Yishuv, 214–215."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"71Merging Traditions<UN>with mixed success.20 Moreover, he gave kabbalah lessons on a regular basis at Jerusalem’s “Great Beit Midrash that is in the courtyard of the Elders’ Residence [Moshav Zkainim].” In 1899, Horowitz and a disciple, Haim Kayam Kadish Halevi, printed Sefer Ateret Yosef by the Lithuanian kabbalist R. Joseph of Lesko (A commentary on the first part of R. Imanuel Hai Ricchi’s Sefer Mishnat Ḥasidim), the two perceived this work as an introduction to and comprehen-sive review of Lurianic Kabbalah.21 Horowitz wrote that it was “the illustrious kabbalists of Beit El’s Holy Community of Rehovot [i.e., Rehovot haNahar,]” who spurred him on to print the book (Haim Shaul Dweck- HaKohen and Avraham Antebbi provided their approvals).22 Thereafter, Kadish Halevi pub-lished a notice in the daily press lauding the book and Horowitz.23 The lat-ter continued to teach kabbalah to small groups and individuals in his house. Among his students were renowned rabbis like Isser Zalman Meltzer, the RID-BaZ (Yaakov David Wilovsky), Isaac HaLevi Herzog, and Tzvi Pesach Frank (who lectured on Talmud and Halakha at Sha’ar haShamayim).24 In one of 20 Ḥayut, Shishim ṿeShalosh Shana, 28–29: “Once he even offered to study with me the book Eṣ Ḥayyim, which was compiled by the kabbalist rabbi R. Hayyim Vital and from the gos-pel of HaARI; and he even studied the first page with me, but I said that I still have time for this field of study, and this isn’t a field of study for a boy of fifteen; in the meantime, I must acquire a great deal of Talmud; and if I am fortunate, one day I will also find the time for the concealed Torah.” Eliezer Raphael Malachi, another “graduate” of this seminary, came away with similar impressions; idem, “R. Shimon Zvi Horowitz,” 330–331.21 Joseph of Lesko, Sefer Ateret Yosef. Kadish added an introduction containing, among other things, a warning to those who engage in kabbalah studies (5a-6b). Moreover, Horowitz proofread the work and added a booklet of definitions and clarifications; Shem meShi-mon, 70b-77b. The book was reprinted by the Vilna Gaon Institute within the following framework: Emanuel Hai Ricchi, Sefer Mishnat Ḥasidim, vol. 2. For a discussion on this book, see Morgenstern, Mysticism and Messianism, 123–124; idem, The Gaon of Vilna, 11–30; Avivi, Kabbala Luriana, 757–759.22 Horowitz, Sefer Or haMeir ṿeQol Mevaser, 1b.

Halevi appears in the general ledgers of the Elders’ Residence be-tween 1891 and 1907 (i.e., from the age of 64 to 80). For example, these records summarize his past: “He was a rosh yeshiva and a native of Vawkavysk” (a town in present-day Be-larus). See Moshav Zkainim, Sefer Ḥeshbon, vol. 11, 14; vol. 31, 56.

Shimon Zvi Horowitz, was known to all as R. Shimon Lider; and he would crank out wonderful Toranic insights on the wisdom of kabbalah in the many classes that he would teach in a couple of synagogues; and Jerusalem’s renowned geniuses and savants would study the wisdom of kabbalah with him; and even the brilliant RIDBaZ whose place of residence was in the holy city of Safad agreed to study kabbalah with him and said that “by R. Shimon we can learn kabbalah;” and R. Shimon would explain quite wonderfully drawing the things closer to the brain with very delectable words for the ears of those who heard them, and he had the good fortune of producing many students; and he was exceedingly humble and patient and does not get [sic] angry; and the blessed Lord granted me several occasions to enjoy from the rapture of his pure sayings and from his wonderful explanations which was sweeter than honey and nectar.25During the yeshiva’s inaugural year, Horowitz published Sefer Or haMeir. In this work, he explained “that the brunt of the Exile’s length is due to the eschewal of studying the kabbalah’s wisdom” and backed this claim with quo-tations from earlier kabbalists and Hasids. Furthermore, the book attempts to inspire traditional Jews to study the rudiments of the mystical literature.26 Sefer Or haMeir also contains approvals by rabbis from various ethnic groups and ideological camps (e.g., the RIDBaZ, Haim Berlin, Haim Zvi Hirsch Braude, Yitzchak Blazer, Abraham Isaac Kook, and sages from Rehovot haNahar, like Dweck-HaKohen, Antebbi, and Yedid Halevi) who felt that limitations should be placed on this sort of kabbalistic outreach. All told, the views that Horowitz expressed therein were neither unusual nor innovative; hence, the sup-port from all the Orthodox streams. With the objective of arousing study of Jewish mysticism, Horowitz also exchanged letters with rabbis and kabbal-ists in Palestine and East Europe. For instance, he corresponded with Hillel Zeitlin, who concomitantly began to disseminate his own brand of kabbalah 25 Hominer, Sefer Kavanot Niflaot, 12b-13b.26 Horowitz, Sefer Or haMeir. In this book, he is still referred to as one of “the students” at Eṣ Ḥayyim, not Sha’ar haShamayim’s head rabbi. Decades later, he published a summary of Sefer Or haMeir’s main points on the grounds that copies of this “valuable” book had run out; idem, Sefer Sanegoriya, 37–43."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"73Merging Traditions<UN>in Warsaw.27 The two met in Jerusalem in around 1925, and Zeitlin churned out enthusiastic reviews of his colleague’s output in Poland’s daily Yiddish press.28Horowitz and his confidantes were also quite active in the publishing arena. As discussed in Chapter 5, he orchestrated a couple of large-scale endeavors in this field. The heads of Sha’ar haShamayim also recommended an array of new books, be they products of the Land of Israel or the Diaspora, champion-ing the study and dissemination of esoteric knowledge. A case in point is the approvals of Menahem Menkhin Halperin, Horowitz, and Auerbach for a book by Aryeh Leibish Lifshitz, a Hasidic kabbalist and miracle worker.29 Moreover, the co-rashei yeshiva offered similar backing for newly-annotated editions of Sefer Mishnat Ḥasidim.30Horowitz and Auerbach’s efforts to spread the kabbalah paid dividends, as their institution steadily grew. According to one estimate, 113 students were enrolled at Sha’ar haShamayim in 1913, a significant portion of whom was ap-parently occupied with the kabbalah.31 One of the yeshiva’s communications from around 1932 put the number of affiliated kabbalists at over a hundred.32 About three years earlier, a similar estimate was cited in a fundraising-mission dossier (pinkas shlihut). Besides the students in the teachers and rabbinical ordination programs, “over a hundred” – a figure that was subsequently cor-rected in the manuscript to “tens” of – “rabbis, great sages, and thinkers in God’s Torah learn there day and night in the revealed and the concealed.”33 Regardless of the precise numbers, it is evident that dozens of kabbalists received substantial support from the institution and were studying there 27 See Meir, “Zeitlin’s Zohar;” 119–157; idem, Rabbi Nahman of Bratslav, 9–39.28 The meeting comes up in Zeitlin’s letters to Binyamin Lipkin-Horowitz from 1939; Zeitlin, Letters to Lipkin-Horowitz, 1939 (ms). Aside for Shimon Horowitz’s books, Zeitlin also reviewed works by Kook, Elyashiv, and Ashlag. In the process, he discussed the kabbalah’s revival in Palestine; Zeitlin, “Vos geit unz izt Eretz-Yisroel,” 4.29 Inserted on a single sheet in the front of the book, the approval is not found in all its copies.

During the early stages of its existence, the lion’s share of the seminary’s donations came from Eastern Europe. The most prominent benefactors were Hasidic rebbes who wished to bolster the study of Kabbalah in Jerusalem, but did not share a rapport with the city’s other kabbalah yehsivot.38 Sha’ar haShamayim’s representatives also personally solicited rabbis to donate their books and give regularly to the institution.39 Nissim Nahum, the aforementioned Sephardic 34 A long list of the habitués that were supported by the institution surfaces in the Account Books of the Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva, 1908–1922 (ms).35 From a perusal through the institution’s general ledgers, it is evident that Sha’ar ha-Shamayim invested a great deal of energy in formulating appeals, translating them into different languages, and delivering them to potential donors.

Two of its envoys’ mission dossiers, from 1910 and 1929, are held by the Israel National Library. Though lacking its emissary’s name, the first dossier contains the signatures of the heads of both the yeshiva and the Ashkenazic court in Jerusalem.

It includes a recommendation from Yaakov Meir, the Sephardic chief rabbi of Mandatory Palestine, a letter by Abraham Isaac Kook, and a long list of targeted destinations across a wide geographic expanse.42 Other envoys were sent to Europe and the Western Hemisphere, but there is scant information about their efforts. The following emissaries are mentioned in Sha’ar haShamayim’s account books: Elazar Koenig (1910), M.

In a 1929 letter to a potential donor in the United States, the rashei yeshiva made note of the ex-tensive support that they had merited from rabbis in East Europe “until the terrible world war broke out:”The bond between us and our throngs of benefactors ceased; however, we naturally expected that soon enough the clouds would scatter and the sword would be reinserted into its sheath, and that true peace would be agreed to across the world; and in the meantime we have amassed expenses and many creditors have surrounded us from every direction, received a copy of the prospective donor’s book; Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva, Letter to Shmuel Yitzhak Hillman, 1931.

Ac-cording to a letter, in Yiddish, sent to family members begging for assistance, Halperin’s cupboard did not even contain “bread of privation.”46From the 1930s onward, donations flowed into Sha’ar haShamayim from the Western Hemisphere. Auerbach embarked on several fundraising trips to the New World in the early 1930s and in 1952. These visits netted considerable media attention.47 His first trip was covered by the Theosophical Society’s newspaper, which published an interview with the rosh yeshiva and an ac-curate description of the seminary’s programs and goals. In fact, this account could have easily been pasted from the institution’s own communications. Moreover, this piece was intended to draw parallels between what was trans-piring in Palestine kabbalah circles and the American group’s own esoteric en-terprise. Auerbach even gave a lecture to the American theosophists on the soul and the concept of gilgul (reincarnation). That said, it is hard to believe that the rabbi truly understood or felt a special affinity for his hosts.48 In any event, these trips led to establishment of the American Friends of Sha’ar ha-Shamayim49 and large donations from American Jewry’s Central Relief Com-mittee between the years 1937 and 1949.50The seminary’s fundraising campaigns also targeted ordinary Jews in East Europe. A case in point is a 1913 letter to Sha’ar haShamayim by one R. Shmuel Aharon Miller, the presiding judge of the Jewish court in the town of Lubawa, Poland. Upon reading the yeshiva’s anguished cries for help, Miller contributed a modest sum. On account of his “limited and tenuous income,” the rabbi was 45 Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva, Letter to an Unknown Addressee in America, 1929 (ms).

To make up for it, though, he also sent his own ideas on “the path of the concealed and the revealed.”51These fundraising efforts did not always go so smoothly. On occasion, criticism was thrust at the profusion of emissaries whose routes had begun to overlap. For instance, one angry donor, R. Shalom ben Shimon Madhuch, wrote to Chief Rabbi Meir that unfamiliar envoys had suddenly arrived in his town.52 In any event, Sha’ar haShamayim enjoyed considerable backing from kabbalists and rabbis from across the Orthodox spectrum and beyond. Over the years, distinguished benefactors lent their signature to the yeshiva’s Toran-ic publications and appeals.53 Sha’ar haShamayim’s fundraising prowess was tied to its program and activities – the topic of the next section. At any rate, the yeshiva certainly merited extensive support from Jewish communities in Eastern Europe, Palestine, and America until 1948.54 Program and RegimenSha’ar haShamayim master plan is rather informative. Owing to ideological changes and/or financial hardship, the program was gradually altered; and with it, the seminary’s character. As per the original plan, which was printed in 1912,55 the seminary’s goal was to teach and disseminate kabbalah among the most accomplished Torah scholars. To this end, the institution sought candidates that were proficient in the Talmudic literature and offered them 51 Miller, Letter to the Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva, 1913 (ms).52 Ben-Yaakov, The Travelling Envoy, vol. 1, 140–142.53 For example, see Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva, “Te’udat Rabanim ṿeGaonim,” 1931 (ms).

Unlike other kabbalah sem-inaries, it would not accept scholars who had already mastered the esoteric corpus.57 Instead, the seminary endeavored to train the next generation of kabbalists and mekhavvnim by means of a well-structured program, which also included revealed studies. (A contemporary model of this sort can be found in the Ahavat Shalom kabbalah seminary in Jerusalem, under the leadership of Rabbi Yaakov Moshe Hillel.58) Although it provides no details of its study regi-men, Sha’ar haShamayim’s initial master plan clearly distinguishes between beginners and advanced students. One of the yeshiva’s early mission dossiers articulated its inaugural objectives in a handful of short yet coherent clauses: (a) to teach kabbalah around the clock, including classes for novices; (b) to enlist gifted people who would dedicate their days and nights to studying kab-balah “in purity” and praying in accordance to the RaShaSh’s intentions; (c) to maintain night shifts for learning Torah, tikkunei haṣot (Midnight Vigils), and prayer; (d) to bring to press Sharabian prayers for distribution in synagogues; (e) to publish books on Jewish mysticism and circulate them among Torah scholars free of charge; and (f ) to inspire traditional Jews from diverse back-grounds to study kabbalah.59 One of Sha’ar haShamayim’s fundraising letters from around 1914 expands on its schedule and modes of learning, among other topics:The location of our holy yeshiva is the city of God in which there are hundreds of scholars occupied day and night with studying the full [spec-trum of the] Torah in the revealed and the concealed, and their Torah is their craft. And this yeshiva is a treasure house for all the scholars and those that grasp the Torah, elders and the elderly and rabbis and ge-niuses, and all who seek God’s world in order to finish their lives in the perfection of the Torah and the sacred. And it [i.e., Sha’ar haShamayim] also has a seminary for people of stature who consecrated themselves for the heavens in purity and asceticism [...] and they deal with the sublime mysteries that are entrenched in the holy place Beit HaARI, namely in the court of the holy HaARI’s ruin and the house in which he was born; this lot was set aside for a large and holy beit midrash; and surrounding 56 Ibid, 4–8.57 Luncz, Netivot Ṣiyon ṿeYerushalayim, 165; Ben-Arieh, A City Reflected in its Times, 346–347, 413.58 For a disquisition on Hillel’s approach and the yeshiva that he founded, see Meir, “The Revealed and the Revealed within the Concealed,” 241–258; idem, “The Boundaries of the Kabbalah,” 163–180.59 Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva, Pinkas Shliḥut, 1910 (ms), 4."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"79Merging Traditions<UN>it are dormitories, a bath house, a cookhouse, and a dining room for the people of stature who removed themselves from the market of life.

In a 1925 program that was released in Hebrew, Yiddish, and English, there was a greater emphasis on the two-pronged system: the revealed alongside the concealed, Halakha alongside kabbalah. The revealed track consisted of several wings: (a) the Young Men’s Seminary (baḥurim yeshiva), which trained “pedagogic instructors;” (b) Rabbinical Advocates; (c) the Department for the Study of Holies and Purities (kod’shim and taharot) – parts of the Talmudic literature that “have been entirely neglected by most of the scholars” (d) the Department for the Study of Halakhas on the Setting of the New Month (hilkhot kidush ha’ḥodesh and sod ha’ibur) Alternatively, the concealed track was comprised of the following units: (a) The Inner Sanctuary [dvir] for Kabbalah Study, which offered daily classes on HaARI and Hayyim Vital’s works for beginners and more advanced students. Graduates earned the title of “internal influencer” (mash-pia pnim) and were certified to serve as teachers. (b) The External Influencers (mashpia ḥutz) Department was responsible for the yeshiva’s public relations and remote classes. Moreover, this unit edited Sha’ar haShamayim’s publica-tions. (c) The Intenters Department was comprised of experts in the Sharabian prayer style. (d) The People of the Guard and of Stature Department (anshei mishmar ma’amad) merged two key elements: a quasi-beit midrash aimed at enhancing Torah-literate people’s knowledge of the hidden Torah (a sort of institute for continuing education); and as stated in a writ of allegiance, the 60 Shaʻar haShamayim Yeshiva, Letter to Yozpa Saqlosqy, 1912 (ms).

In roughly 1928, the institu-tion established special talmudei torah.62 Henceforth, the name that graced its official letterhead was “The Central H[oly] Yeshiva Sha’ar haShamayim Next to the Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai Synagogue, an Assembly of Saints, Torah Luminaries who are Consecrated to Study the Revealed Torah and the Wis-dom of the Truth, the Torah of Kabbalah, and to Pray according to Intention.” Alternatively, the English version reads “The Generally Holy Talmudical & Cabbala Academy Shaar Hashamaim & Rabbinical College and Branches in Jerusalem.” The letterhead also notes that “the yeshiva disseminates the Torah of truth, the wisdom of kabbalah, to the most accomplished of God-fearing excellent Torah scholars who are proficient in the Talmud and halakhic adju-dicators, and those qualified to enter God’s secret.” Moreover, it refers to the two main branches of the institution: “Kehal ḥasidim [Community of Hasids] Yeshiva of Mekhavvnim” alongside the “Liskhat Rabanim [Bureau of Rabbis] who are completing requirements for instruction.” Sha’ar haShamayim also has “other branches in the neighborhoods around Jerusalem [i.e., the Old City].” Lastly, “the yeshiva aspires to blaze paths of the holy study between the Torah scholars abroad, so that they can negotiate with the responsa on the Torah’s secrets” (as discussed below, such responsa were prevalent at the time).63 Sep-arate flyers articulating the yeshiva’s goals and appealing for donations were circulated on behalf of the Lishkhat Rabanim.64 In 1929, the institution even opened a Talmud academy for Sephardic children.6561 Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva, Ḥotam Tokhnit (1925), 5–10; English section, 6–10.

Especially interesting is the emphasis on the fact that Sha’ar haShamayim’s upper echelon, namely its mekhavvnim, are “saintly rabbis, illuminators of the mysteries that consecrated themselves in accordance with the examinations and instructions of the most illustrious of kabbalists [in order] to direct their prayers with yiḥudim pursuant to the great siddur of the RaShaSh of blessed memory.”66 Like the yeshiva’s earlier communications, the booklet raises the banner of incremental and supervised studies, culminating with a sort of “au-thorization” for its graduates to deal with esoteric wisdom and assume the title of kabbalist or mekhavven. In 1940, the heads of the yeshiva boasted that to this point in its existence, Sha’ar haShamayim had already trained hundreds of kabbalists, several of whom have reached the level of mekhavvnim.67 This statement attests to the importance that the yeshiva placed on acquiring ex-pertise in the RaShaSh’s intentions.According to one source, Nissim Nahum agreed to back Sha’ar haShamayim on the condition that its candidates for the title of mekhavven be tested by none other than Chaim Shaul Dweck-HaKohen at the Rehovot haNahar Ye-shiva.68 This, in all likelihood, refers to the same examination that he used for his own students. More specifically, before they were allowed to serve as can-tors, the candidates performed mock services with intentions before Dweck-HaKohen.69 Although we lack firm evidence of these kinds of tests at Sha’ar haShamayim, there was indeed a strong link between the two institutions. For returnees from the lands of the East and the West, who owing to impatience and hard work their children are neglected, left without good manners, and they are liable to fall into the net of inciters and agitators, God forbid.” The instructors at this school are de-picted as “excellent Sephardic teachers.”66 Sha’ar haShamayim, Official Letterhead, 1920s (ms).67 Sha’ar haShamayim, Mazkeret Brakha (Remembrance of Love), 1: “Hundreds of schol-ars having completed all the courses performed [sic] in the holy studies in our Yeshiva achieved the title ‘Mechavnim.’ Many others were awarded the title ‘Mekubalim’ who of-fer their prayers in the most passionate spirit in holiness.” The booklet contains a brief survey of the yeshiva, in Yiddish and English, along with several accompanying pictures, approvals by Herzog, Frank, and Charlap, and a long list of rabbis who support the institu-tion.

This affiliation was essential because the heads of the former lacked clear traditions on how to perform Sharabian intentions, and the yeshiva only possessed a few manuscripts by the RaShaSh and his dis-ciples. The seminary’s general ledgers record outlays for numerous trips of this sort to Rehovot haNahar. For instance, in 1911, “three wagons” were rented “for the yeshiva’s rabbis who went to pray with intention at the holy community of Beit El, may it be predicated on justice in Rehovot.”70 The New Beit ElThe rabbis at Sha’ar haShamayim deemed their yeshiva to be the new Beit El. To begin with, the works of HaARI and the RaShaSh stood at the heart of its program, and the same could be said for praying with intentions. Like previous generations at Beit El, the seminary’s resident kabbalists entered into “writs of allegiance” among themselves.71 In 1938, Moshe David Gaon even groused that “Over the last few years, the Beit El Yeshiva began to serve as a synonym for another kabbalah seminary that was founded in Jerusalem, namely Sha’ar haShamayim.”72As noted, the habitués of Rehovot haNahar had adopted a similar tact after breaking away from the venerable institution. Viewing themselves as either the successors of or the new Beit El Yeshiva, they basically adopted its practices and regimen. This sense of continuity also came to expression in print. In a few of its earlier publications, the seminary referred to itself as, among other things, “Beit El, may it be founded on justice, in Rehovot.”73 What is more, a 70 Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva, Account Books, 1908–1922 (ms), part 1, 27. Similar trips were taken in Iyar and Sivan 1912, ibid, 64, 66.71 An abridged copy of a writ of allegiance graces one of the yeshiva’s plans; Sha’ar ha-Shamayim, Ḥotam Tokhnit (1925), 19–20 (not included in the English section).72 Gaon, Oriental Jews, vol. 1, 141. Important source material concerning Sha’ar haShamay-im has also been deposited in the Gaon Archive; Gaon, Notes and Documents (ms). However, his negative attitude towards Sha’ar haShamayim surfaces in a note held by the Eliyahu Eliashar Archive. As per this document, Gaon threw away most of the material that pertains to the “The Ashkenazic yeshiva that took the name Sha’ar haShamayim;” Gaon, Letter to Eliashar (ms).73 Likewise, the introduction to Sefer Ḥayim ṿeShalom, dubs the habitués of Rehovot haNa-har “the sages and rabbis of the new Beit El which is in the company of Rehovot, may it be founded on justice.” In addition, the newspaper HaBazeleth ran a notice in the name of the yeshivat Sha’ar haShamayim and “Beit El in Rehovot under the auspices of the"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"83Merging Traditions<UN>familiar picture of Beit El was added to the introduction of a book, Sefer S’fat Emet, that Rehovot haNahar put out in around 1904.74Consistent with this mindset, every kabbalah yeshiva in Jerusalem declared itself to be an inimitable, one-of-a-kind entity. For instance, a 1912 letter by Sha’ar haShamayim’s representatives boasted that “experts who merited to en-ter into God’s secret” are on the yeshiva’s faculty. Moreover, it enumerates the reasons for the yeshiva’s exceptionalism:And this sacred learning, which over the past few generations had be-come hidden and was vanishing, on account of our many sins, and those learning Torah did not touch it and this Torah was nearly forgotten among the Jews, and we would have, God forbid, become bereft of and would have lost the Torah’s soul – when it is known to those that enter into God’s secret that learning the Torah’s mysteries [Kabbalah] is the fruit of the at-tributes and inner soul of the holy Torah; and now by means of the holy yeshiva that we have established in God’s city, the place of the treasure and the source of the soul of those that received the Torah on Mount Horeb, as is known according to the secret and by means of the propa-gation of those learning [kabbalah] and the dissemination of books of study and prayer that are printed by our yeshiva, the holy learning has spread among the Jews in the Land and abroad; and at night, as in the day, the Torah of truth shall be illuminated for us by the light of God in the secret dialogue on behalf of the soul of the yisraeli nation.75Similar sentiments as to the uniqueness of the new yeshiva resurface in the in-troduction to one of its publications from around 1914.76 Not surprisingly, this text drew the ire of Rehovot haNahar’s habitués. As a result, a quasi-apology was inserted on a separate page at the end of the volume. The correction states that these words refer exclusively to Ashkenazim, who for the most part have limited esoteric knowledge, whereas the Sephardim have engaged in Jewish esoteric knowledge since the days of the RaShaSh:Bukharians;” Rehovot haNahar and Sha’ar haShamayim, “Qriya Gdola,” 1909 (announce-ment). This sense of continuity is discussed at length in Moskowitz, Ḥayei haRashash, 95–116.74 Mishan, Sefer Sfat Emet, introduction.75 Sha’ar haShamayim, Letter to an Unknown Addressee (ms). This communication was signed by many of the yeshiva’s regulars, foremost among them Shimon Zvi Horow-itz, Chaim Yehuda Leib Auerbach, Aharon Shlomo Maharil, and Menahem Menkhin Halperin.76 Siddur Ḥayim ṿeShalom, introduction."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"chapter 384<UN>On page 2 of the introduction were printed: “These things that were heretofore concealed and abandoned in the corner” [i.e., the kabbalah was neglected until the establishment of Sha’ar haShamayim], and these things were said in haste.

And by virtue of this sacred learning, may we merit to see the age of the redemption and the rectification of the worlds swiftly in our time, amen.77Rehovot haNahar’s criticism notwithstanding, its own flyers bear similar claims of exclusivity. For instance,It is well known to all who come to our city’s gate and its inhabitants who have seen and heard that which was heard in the Land and abroad that there does not exist in another place a yeshiva so abundant in quantity and quality, where they learn day and night, and pray with intention. Our synagogue is the only one of its kind in the world, as is known to all who come to the holy city of Jerusalem, that it is a foundation and a cynosure for all who study the books of HaARI and the RaShaSh.78It would appear, then, that this sort of fanfaronade was commonplace among all of Jerusalem’s kabbalah seminaries, especially in their appeals to the general public. Between Ashkenazim and SephardimIn theory, Sha’ar haShamayim can be classified as an Ashkenazic yeshiva and all the others as Sephardic institutions.

For example, while most of Sha’ar haShamayim’s regulars were indeed Ashkenazic, Nissim Nahum, was among its top patrons. In one of Sha’ar haShamayim’s fundraising letters, Nahum wrote that the insti-tution is “the only one of its kind and purpose in the world, and great rabbis have studied kabbalah books and have made great tikkunim therein.”79 At its inception, the yeshiva’s stamp included the sentence “The Sha’ar haShamayim Seminary whose purpose is to advance kabbalah wisdom of the community of Ashkenazim.” Soon enough, though, the ethnic dimension was obfuscated: “The Ecumenical Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva, its purpose is to advance the wisdom of the truth,” or plainly put “The Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva and its Branches.”80 In 1922, the institution printed a special booklet in Hebrew and Judeo-Arabic titled Ṣa‘aqat Bnei Yisrael [The Cry of the Israelites].81 Part paean to the yeshiva and part a call for financial support, it is signed by, among others, the leading figures of Rehovot haNahar and Beit El, such as the kabbalists Yom Tov Yedid Halevi, Ezra Harari-Raful, Shalom Hedaya, Eliyahu Yaakov Lag'imi, and Nissim Nahum. In turn, a few of Sha’ar haShamayim’s kabbalists, along with various Hasidic rabbis, lent their signatures to fundraising campaigns for Rehovot haNahar. A case in point is a Yiddish-English flyer from the 1920s that raves about the wonders performed and the remedies, amulets, and other talismans concocted by Rehovot haNahar’s regulars. This particular appeal is endorsed by, inter alios, the kabbalists and/or rabbis Menahem Menkhin Hal-perin, Yitzchak Zelig Morgenstern, Menachem Mendl of Strikov, Zvi Chanoch Hacohen Levin, Avraham Mordechai Alter of Gur, and Shlomo Elyashiv.82Moshe David Gaon and other observers were flabbergasted by this co-operation, as they deemed Sha’ar haShamayim to be a rival of Beit El and 79 Nahum, “Ata Hashem” (undated Placard).

The fact that kabbalists from each of the different ethnic groups studied and prayed at all the various seminaries punctuates this show of cross-pollination. For instance, at different stages in their lives Shlomo Elyas-hiv, Aharon Avraham Slotki, Halperin, and Yeshaya Asher Zelig Margaliot were evidently affiliated with Rehovot haNahar and Sha’ar haShamayim. Although they did not necessarily spend each waking hour under his wing and studied in other frameworks, all these figures considered themselves loyal disciples or confidants of Chaim Shaul Dweck-HaKohen.84 Not surprisingly, they sought to build ties between kabbalists and Hasidim in Eastern Europe and Jerusalem. In light of the above, one can understand not only the recommendations that were given by Hasidic Ashkenazic rabbis for books espousing the Sharabian way, but the popular stories about Dweck-HaKohen’s interest in Hasidism and Lithuanian strains of kabbalah. For instance, he presumably studied the Zohar with the Vilna Gaon’s explanations and annotated the Lithuanian scholar’s commentary to Sifra deSeniutha. One source even claims that Dweck- HaKohen mentioned Elimelech of Lizhensk’s Hasidic booklet Ṣetel Katan on a daily basis and sought to publish a new edition of Sefer Heikhal haBrakha by the rebbe of Komarno.85 It is worth noting that Dweck-HaKohen’s actual interest in these schools of thought was by and large superficial. Therefore, they naturally had little impact on his approach or gospel.The extent of Dweck-HaKohen’s enthusiasm for the “Ashkenazic esoteri-cism” notwithstanding, one of Beit El’s sextons praised the inter-ethnic Jewish relations in 1928: “It can be said that the virtue of the rabbi, Shalom Sharabi, protects this house [i.e., Beit El] in which peace resides, for in this synagogue Ashkenazim and Sephardim pray together; sometimes the shaliaḥ ṣibbur [prayer leader] is Sephardic and sometimes he is Ashkenazic; everyone prays in a single nusaḥ [version of the liturgy] from the siddur of intentions of the RaShaSh of blessed memory.”8683 Gaon, Oriental Jews, vol. 1, 141. He made note of flyers praising Sha’ar haShamayim, which were signed by the kabbalists Yom Tov Yedid Halevi, Ezra Harari-Raful, Shalom Hedaya, Eliyahu Lag'imi, and Nissim Nahum.84 Hillel, “The Life of Dweck-HaKohen,” 27.

That same"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"87Merging Traditions<UN>These types of statements were commonplace among representatives from all of Jerusalem’s kabbalah seminaries. A case in point is the following sequence from an appeal that was made by Rehovot haNahar: “We toil day and night to spread the wisdom of the kabbalah between all the ethnic groups without distinction.” These efforts, he claimed, already paid dividends: at all hours of the day, there are dozens of students “from all the ethnic groups” at the yeshiva “apprenticing in the wisdom of the kabbalah and prayer.”87 This same theme also comes up in a Hebrew-Yiddish-English flyer: “And throughout the years of its existence, Rehovot haNahar gave fruit and its light was spread in the communities of holiness that are found in Jerusalem; Ashkenazim and Sephardim drew from it sweet water from a spring that emanates from its sacred sites.”88 Sha’ar haShamayim also availed itself of such terminology in later communications. A mission dossier from around 1929 includes the fol-lowing passage: “Over a hundred rabbis and illustrious sages from all the ave-nues of our brethren the house of Israel, Ashkenazim, and Sephardim, ponder God’s Torah day and night in the revealed and concealed, older rabbis and men of action who focus their prayers using the siddur of our master and teacher Rabbi Shalom Sharabi.”89The message of Sephardic-Ashkenazic harmony recurs in an epistle au-thored by some of Rehovot haNahar and Beit El’s kabbalists: “At present when the holy yeshiva Sha’ar haShamayim is known and renowned and the branches of the ecumenical community of Hasids is renowned in its [sic] purpose and holiness throughout the world, and more than a hundred illustrious sages from all the avenues of our nation bnei yisrael [the Jewish people] are learning therein without any ethnic differences.”90Despite these glowing reports, the yeshivot were clearly divided along ethnic lines. On the other hand, there was certainly a substantial degree of co-operation between the many and manifold kabbalists that were united around the RaShaSh’s way. As discussed below, this collaboration was exemplified by joint ventures to publish HaARI’s works and the RaShaSh’s siddur as well as an year, Grayevski expressed similar sentiments: “And to this day, they [i.e., sages in Beit El] pore over the Torah of kabbalah and prayer according to the intentions, from our sages and rabbis both the Sephardim and the Ashkenazim alike;” Grayevski, “Gedalya Ḥiyon,” 201–202.

While all the yeshi-vot had students from all the Jewish ethnic communities, Sha’ar haShamayim attracted members of both major Ashkenazic factions. The consensus view whereby only Lithuanians (mitnagdim) attended the yeshiva or that all its programs adhered to “the Vilna Gaon’s kabbalah” is unfounded. As noted in a circa 1884 book by one Yitzchak Kahana, an earlier undertaking to found a Jerusalem-based kabbalistic institution in the spirit of the Vilna Gaon – a sort of Lithuanian equivalent to Beit El, whose regulars would occupy them-selves with the savant’s esoteric writings and pray from his siddur – failed to take root. Kahana claimed that none other than Raphael Yedidyah Abulafia, Beit El’s rosh yeshiva at the time, immersed himself in the Vilna Gaon’s books on the kabbalah.91 Upon Kahana’s passing in 1901, the newspaper HaBazeleth wrote that “it was his desire to institute a holy association in Jerusalem to study kabbalah books of the Vilna Gaon, a saint of blessed memory, en masse, but he was unable to see it through except with individuals.”92 These sort of ideas were also bandied about by the Rivlin family, Although they were not put into practice, in the Rivlins’ fertile imagination and writings, these heartfelt wishes were transformed into historical fact.93On some matters, Horowitz saw eye-to-eye with Kahana (in one of his books, the former even extolled Kahana’s virtues). Sha’ar haShamayim’s rosh yeshiva also held much in common with the Rivlin family, such as on the mat-ter of the settlement of Palestine and the search for the Ten Tribes. That said, his educational vision contrasted sharply from that of Kahana and the Rivlins. Though a misnaged by birth and temperament, Horowitz often cited from Ha-sidic texts as well as works by the Vilna Gaon and his disciples.94 His co-rosh yeshiva, Chaim Yehuda Leib Auerbach, came from a Hasidic family. In fact, the latter often elaborated his signature with his lineage, dating back to his great grandfather – Jacob Joseph of Polonne, the Ba’al Shem Tov’s closest disciple. 91 Kahana, Sefer Toldot Yiṣḥaq, 2a; Dablitski, “Dvarim Aḥadim.”92 Refael Zerah Aryeh Leib of Rakavah, “Alon Bakhut,” 153. The author was Kahana’s brother-in-law.93 The Rivlins were wont to claim that the kabbalists were united around the Vilna Gaon’s idea of the redemption. Similarly, they asserted that Kabbalah study in Jerusalem was part and parcel of the proactive nationalist efforts to usher in the messianic age. Needless to say, these accounts are tendentious and radical.94 Horowtiz, Or haMeir; idem, Sefer Sanigoriya."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"89Merging Traditions<UN>This Lithuanian-Hasidic amalgam is manifest in one of Sha’ar haShamayim’s fundraising appeals. To begin with, the document lionizes both the Ba’al Shem Tov (BeShT) and the Vilna Gaon for publically disseminating the kabbalah – a claim that is far from substantiated. Moreover, the authors contend that the unification of the BeShT and the Vilna Gaon’s respective methods will hasten the redemption.95 Be that as it may, the seminary’s program revolved around Lurianic kabbalah and the RaShaSh’s writings, so that it toed the line with the rest of Jerusalem’s kabbalah circles. If Sha’ar haShamayim’s habitués had in-deed been exclusively occupied with the gospel of the two Eastern European luminaries, the institution’s fate would have certainly been quite different. By embracing the Sharabian approach, it too was worthy of the label “the new Beit El.” The Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva, the Land of Israel and Rabbi KookAll the kabbalists in Jerusalem saw the very revelation and spread of Kabbalah as an integral part of an effort to discover the secret of “the messiah’s heels” (i.e., the year of the redemption). Needless to say, the Land of Israel and Je-rusalem played a key role in these mystical yearnings. The heads of Sha’ar ha-Shamayim introduced another factor into this equation that transformed the widespread hyperbole about “the heels of the messiah.” In several places, they tied his coming to the Zionist activity in Palestine and the idea of settling the Land.96 The Zionist movement, Auerbach and Horowitz believed, had created an opportunity to spur on the redemption, which will be brought to fruition by kabbalistic deeds. On this matter, they diverged from their counterparts at the other kabbalah seminaries, who adopted a more conservative outlook. In one communication, Sha’ar haShamayim’s heads went so far as to link the yeshiva’s establishment to the Zionist idea:The kabbalah, namely the Torah’s soul (which had always illuminated the darkness of the Exile and kindled a holy flame of salvation in everyone’s 95 Sha’ar haShamayim, Pinkas Shliḥut, 1910 (ms). On the small handful of Bratslav prayers that were conducted in Sha’ar haShamayim, see Shmuel Halevi Horowitz, Sefer Yemei Shmuel, vol. 3, 5a.96 For instance, after a philanthropist contributed a handsome sum for this arrangement, the proceeds from the sale of Grayevski’s, Sefer haYishuv (a book on the Hebrew settle-ment outside Jerusalem’s Old City) were earmarked for Sha’ar haShamayim.

Even the new movement [i.e., Zionism], a product of this generation, which has stirred up among our nation, and the format for the Return to Zion, was devoid of life force and the fire of sanctity, and was unable to attract nobleman, namely the luminaries of Israel, with its strength, exclusively because it [Zionism] is a bride grounded on a foundation of secularism and not an expression from the source of holiness, and did not contain within it the same soul, the soul of the Torah and Israel, which is united in the one secret and is achieved with the wisdom of the kabbalah. The visionaries of the idea of the holy yeshiva Sha’ar haShamayim’s estab-lishment saw this and understood that there is no place more fitting than Eretz Yisrael whose “earth is the life of the soul”97 and that was the moth-erland of the kabbalah throughout the generations, in order to establish a central and large yeshiva for the Torah of kabbalah to its fullest extent, and they established the yeshiva Sha’ar haShamayim and its branches for this purpose.98The idea that kabbalistic activity is the engine behind the national awak-ening and a complement of the “profane” Zionist enterprise was indeed commensurate with the viewpoint of Abraham Isaac haKohen Kook. It is no wonder, then, that Sha’ar haShamayim’s leaders backed his appointment as chief rabbi of Jerusalem in the 1920s and honored him with the title of kehu-nat rosh (“top of the priesthood”).99 Along with other rabbis, they endorsed a placard defending R. Kook against belligerent, false accusations that were dis-seminated throughout the streets of Jerusalem (even though Sha’ar haShamay-im’s habitués included kabbalists who took issue with his Zionist positions, such as RYAZ Margaliot).100For his part, R. Kook commended individuals and institutions that toiled on the esoteric wisdom in Jerusalem and wrote approvals for many locally- published kabbalah books.

Kook heaped praise on the yeshiva on multiple occa-sions, and his approvals grace many of its publications and communications. After a visit to the seminary, he extolled the “unique attributes of ” its “Torah scholars.”101 The Zionist thinker described Sha’ar haShamayim as “the only holy yeshiva with such an objective in the world.”102 In a letter to the rabbinical emissary Suisse Levi, which was added to the yeshiva’s mission dossier from 1929, R. Kook remarked thus:Felicitous is he that holds their hand and causes the spread of the holy learning, things that were concealed by God and deserve to be taken and illuminated across the far reaches of the universe for those who enter God’s secret, for those who fear Him, and those who ponder his Name [in order] to cultivate the plant of salvation and redemption for the holy people, to hasten the bells of our righteous messiah.103Following public complaints against Sha’ar haShamayim’s emissaries in 1925, R. Kook offered solace to the yeshiva’s sexton in San Paulo and to one R. Meir Leib Kaufman:I consider it a sacred duty to tell my distinguished colleagues, not to pay any attention whatsoever to the words of slander that were written by some utterly irresponsible person against the holy yeshiva Sha’ar ha-Shamayim, which is a magnificent seminary where many students who excel in the revealed and in the concealed and in worship reside whilst persevering in our sacred Torah....

Kook was in contact with a few of Rehovot haNahar’s sages. He even gave a eulogy at Dweck-HaKohen’s funeral, during which he was obstreperously heckled by local “zealots.”105A Torah scholar by the name of Avraham Rabinsky complained to R. Kook about the Land-of-Israel kabbalah seminaries’ “exaggerated revelation.” He bemoaned the extensive efforts to disseminate the kabbalah, especially the countless flyers that were distributed by Sha’ar haShamayim. In response, R. Kook stressed the importance of conveying esoteric knowledge to the worthy.106 This issue comes up in many of R. Kooks’s works; it is even latent in his earlier, pre-aliyah writing.107 As evidenced, though, from stern communica-tions, which have only recently been published,108 Kook often placed restric-tions on the study and dissemination of kabbalah.109 For example, he limited in-depth study of the esoteric to halakhic adjudicators and Talmud scholars. What is more, Kook preferred that kabbalah students be wise, mature, and no less than fifty years old!110 From this standpoint, he was on the same page as all the seminaries under review.Despite the soaring rhetoric, these calls to return to the kabbalah failed to penetrate the borders of traditional Jewish society. Such inroads would only 104 Kook, ibid, vol. 4, 245–246 (letter 1/320). That same day, R. Kook also wrote to R.

David Cohen (the Nazirite), a confidante of R. Kook.112 Cohen, whose father and grandfather were distinguished rabbis in Lithuania, came to Palestine in 1921. From that point on, he wandered between various yeshi-vot, such as Rehovot haNahar, and was in touch with Sephardic kabbalists in Jerusalem.113 In a diary entry from 1922, the Nazirite offered an account of a nocturnal visit to Sha’ar haShamayim, which is intermingled with yearnings for prophecy:Tired, weary, and irreverent, after toiling with sleeplessness most of the nights, right now I am about to fall asleep, and I will [then] get up and go to the mikve, as is my habit day in and day out; and following the [morn-ing] prayer I will feel a diminution in the power of thought, and a weak-ness of the body. I walked a little in the streets of Jerusalem, to knock on Zion’s gates, the yeshivot; perhaps the holy sight of the city’s visage and its sacred places will have a beneficial effect on me. I was in Sha’ar haShamayim. How lowly and sunken into the ground is this building, a veritable ruin; one must climb up paths [ just to get there]; and there [in the seminary] sit the holy ascetic “mekhavvnim,” who immerse them-selves day and night in the Torah and wisdom of the kabbalah.

Hunger, 1844). Moreover, the Nazirite received his first kabbalah books from R. Menachem Mendel Nai of Sandomi-erz; see Cohen, Dodi leṢevi, 101–102; idem, Mishnat haNazir, 28–29; Bitty, Philosophy and Kabbalah, 142–148.

These same ideas also inform R. Kook’s vision of his “central yeshiva,” not least its educational program, where kabbalah studies assume a principal role. A coherent presentation of this same plan turns up in the Nazirite’s mystically-oriented diary, the so-called “Scroll of Secrets.” Due to self-censorship, the diary has not been published in full. Besides the author’s yearnings for prophecy, it describes his reclusion, exiles, prayers, self-denial, and revelations. The Scroll reveals that Cohen moved to Palestine with the intention of establishing “a central yeshiva, with an all-encompassing and comprehensive learning pro-gram.” The “raison d’être” behind this hypothetical institution was “the revival of the spirit of prophecy in Eretz Yisrael, under the special influence of our master and teacher the rabbi Kook.”115 As averred in the Nazirite’s book Kol haNevuah (Voice of Prophecy), the road to prophecy runs through prayers, mortifications, and spiritualistic quests as well as “wisdom and science.”116 These high hopes were certainly dashed; and save for individual students who fell under his spell at different periods in his life, Cohen failed to attract a large following.117 He undoubtedly found kindred spirits in R. Kook and a couple of Jerusalem’s mystics, but these relationships certainly did not spawn a new “kabbalah circle.”118 Upon editing R. Kook’s Orot haKodesh (the Lights of Holi-ness), the Nazirite felt that he was engaged in true mysteries, as he compared 114 Cohen, Mishnat haNazir, 48.115 Ibid.

For a disquisition on this topic, see Themanlys, “Prophecy Today,” 195–201; Bitty, Philosophy and Kabbalah, 256–279.117 On one occasion, the Nazirite even expressed his desire to recruit a small group to restore the prophecy; Cohen, Kol Tsofayikh, 55–56, 59–60, 75, 136; idem, Mishnat haNazir, 58. Con-versely, it pained him to see that R. Kook’s new yeshiva was not fulfilling this purpose; ibid, 71–72. In the early 1940s, Cohen attracted a small group of kabbalah students; ibid, 98–99.

In certain respects, he was indeed successful. A case in point is his efforts to find the Ten Tribes – an idea that is part and parcel of his kabbal-istic approach. Horowitz tried to get Jerusalem’s Sephardic kabbalists on the bandwagon, but came up empty-handed. Moreover, his efforts to turn Sha’ar haShamayim into a center for expeditions of this sort drew mixed results. At any rate, this episode sheds light on Horowitz’s unusual eclectic worldview.In 1908, Shimon Menachem Lazar of Drohobycz (1864–1932), an editor and Hebrew scholar, came out with a thick tome on Ḥidot haHagadot haNiflaot al Dvar Aseret haShvatim vePitronam (The Riddles of the Wonderful Myths on the Ten Tribes and their Solution). The journal HaSchiloah had published an earlier, serial version of this work in installments between 1902 and 1903. At the end of the book’s introduction is a summary of Lazar’s approach to these same myths:And this belief [in the Lost Tribes], which filled the hearts of our nation for some two thousand years, has been suspended in our time, the days of the Jewish Enlightenment, to the point that they have even ceased to think about the Ten Tribes, as though they never existed and were never created. Today, a misguided [sense of ] embarrassment will cover the face of a Jew, even from the Orthodox party, on anything regarding the Ten Tribes. Like a nighttime vision in a dream, the memory of the Tribes has abruptly vanished from the congregation of Israel and has become the realm of the Christian English, some of whom are endeavoring to prove that they, of all people, are the Lost Tribes of Israel.11 Lazar, Ḥidot haHagadot, 5.

One of them indeed boasted that upon travelling from South-ern Arabia to Eretz Yisrael its [i.e., the river’s] traces were revealed to him.” That said, Lazar was apparently unaware of two contemporaneous develop-ments: the distribution of the mythical literature on the Tribes in East Europe; and the intensive activity within the heart of the Old Yishuv in Jerusalem to find the lost Israelites. His book falls under the heading of the far-ranging re-search literature on this topic whose main conclusion was that the Tribes had assimilated and disappeared, so that it is no longer possible to find any remnant of this exile. Moreover, the authors of this corpus posited that these myths lack a solid foundation. As a result, any initiative to find the lost Jews is bound to be a wild goose chase.2 This literature put an emphasis on documents that are tied to past efforts to locate the Tribes as well as the outlook of the explorers. Furthermore, they toiled to reconstruct the Israelites’ history in the Diaspora until their extinction. The most prominent and influential of these writers was the Orientalist Adolf (Abraham) Neubauer. In 1888, he published an exhaus-tive Hebrew anthology on issues pertaining to the Ten Tribes and the Sons of Moses. Soon after, he released an English survey on the various explorers who placed their sights on this elusive prize.3 The Awakening of Explorers in JerusalemIn stark contradistinction to these firm conclusions, new ideologically-driven explorers surfaced during this period who employed the research literature in 2 Mendel Wohlman also reached this conclusion in his 1907 study; idem, “The Sambatyon and the Ten Tribes,” 279–305. Countervailing this trend was Shmuel Ze’ev Goldman, Sefer Nidḥei Yisrael (1941). In the introduction (v), he wrote that “the reason that stirred me on to formu-late this book: that most of the books that were written on this topic were infiltrated by the spirit of the Enlightenment, and they built a stubborn and treacherous case. Moreover, the occupation with these books has produced a sad result, namely a couple of Torah scholars are talking about the above-mentioned topics as though they were a popular fable that is intertwined in the air.” At any rate, Goldman endeavored to verify the story of the Ten Tribes and the existence of the Sambatyon, not to actually find or support those who were searching for them. In the early 1900s, a couple of booklets focused on tracking the Israelites’ assimila-tion into various nations; see, for example, Israel Balkind, Where are the Ten Tribes? (1928).3 See Neubauer, “Qvutṣim ’al ’Inyanei ’Aseret haShvatim;” idem, “Where Are the Ten Tribes,” 14–28, 95–114, 185–201, 408–423. Later on, the emphasis shifted to describing the worldview of groups that claimed to descend from the Lost Tribes.

More specifically, they gleaned texts from this corpus that suited their theories and interpreted slivers of ideas as clues of the Tribes’ se-cret location. The research literature served as a catalyst for their expedition-ary activities. Among the new strain of explorers were not only groups from a variety of nations, such as the English and Japanese, but several kabbalists in Jerusalem. At the heart of this newfangled enterprise stood none other than R. Shimon Zvi Horowitz, who attempted to harness the Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva to this cause.A couple of short descriptions of Horowitz’s trip were produced by a small handful of researchers and novelists, none of whom provided a full analysis of this episode.4 While the kabbalist was still alive, the Hebrew writer Israel Zarchi (1909–1947) condensed the entire trek into a short story, which draws on information that found its way to the Jerusalem-based novelist via conver-sations with some Kabbalists and sundry books. However, Zarchi described the trip from the vantage point of one Moshe Yehoshua HaKimchi (a figure that will merit our attention below), whereas Horowitz was assigned a secondary role. In other words, he was not portrayed as the initiator or heart and soul of this venture.5 Aharon Reuveni (1886–1971) also depicted Horowitz and his expedition in a couple of short stories that were published in the 1930s.6 In Re-uveni’s works of fiction, Horowitz goes by the name of R. Pinhas Vatika, heads an organization by the name of Shivat Nidaḥim (the Return of the Exiled), and writes a book about his travels. Zarchi and Reuveni’s belletristic stories are not intended to serve as an historical account, as they freely mixed truth with fic-tion. What is more, the writers did not assemble every last piece of information about the journey, take stock of all the motives behind it, or display an interest in the subsequent attempts to locate the Tribes within the framework of Sha’ar haShamayim. They also gave the false impression that this expedition was a one-time messianic adventure. In reality, it was one of many interconnected chapters in a life-long effort that was fueled by a strong passion to hasten the End of the Days, in conjunction with a desire to spread kabbalah among the masses. Both of these goals stemmed from the belief that Jewry stood at 4 Aešcoly, Yisrael, 170–172; idem, “David Reubeni,” 6; Ya’ari, “Emissaries of the Land of Israel to the Lost Tribes,” 480–484; idem, Shluḥei Ereṣ Yisrael, 150–151; Morgenstern, “Meqomam shel ’Aseret haShvatim,” 225–231; Malachi, “Horowitz,” 330–331; Brawer, Zikhronot Av uBeno, 461–463; Ben-Ami, Stories from the Jerusalem Parliament, 194–195.5 Zarchi, “The Sambatyon,” 96–148.6 The stories were part of an uncompleted novel titled Ruaḥ Kadim (Easterly Wind).

In consequence, Horowitz felt that it was incumbent upon him to understand the roots of this development and act accordingly.Horowitz viewed the search for the Lost Tribes as part of the efforts to ac-celerate the redemption process in the spirit of the Vilna Gaon, or at least what he and like-minded kabbalists attributed to the savant. It seems that these sort of traditions are late and should be tied to a couple students of the Gaon’s later disciples at the end of the nineteenth century. In any event, Horowitz’s ap-proach reflects the mature stage of that same “tradition,” which was followed by some of the Lithuanian expatriates in Jerusalem.7 An early manifestation of this same trend informs R. Moshe Slatky’s Ner Moshe. Printed in 1882, this book is comprised of several works that are tied to the Polish kabbalah and “an old letter from our brethren the Sons of Moses our Rabbi who dwell beyond the Sambatyon.” Slatky also issued a warning: “Don’t lean your ear towards the voice faltering like a leaf in freefall saying we have God forbid lost hope, that there is no Sambatyon River and no Ten Tribes.”8 The author integrated these texts into an all-encompassing vision, which is described at length in the open-ing pages of his book. In short, Slatky believed that the best way to expedite the messiah’s coming is by learning the Zohar. Consequently, the author’s ob-jective was to inspire people to study this work, even those without any back-ground in Jewish mysticism. The role of the Ten Tribes in Ner Moshe was part of a broader esoteric campaign to hasten the redemption. A few years later, such outlooks would stir new kabbalists into action, some of whom even embarked on missions to find “the lost brothers.”In around 1898, Shimon Zvi Horowitz, along with Moshe Yehoshua HaKim-chi and Shlomo Wechsler, released a small pamphlet, Drishat Kevod Ḥakhmei haTorah (Demanding Respect for Torah Scholars) containing a detailed plan for an expedition in search of the Ten Tribes. HaKimchi was occupied with similar projects in Jerusalem even earlier. Moreover, he was active in groups that promoted “the redemption of the Holy Land’s soil.”9 In the early 1890s, he printed two booklets by the name of Zikhron Yerushalayim and another one titled Ma’amar haMuskam. These works interpret verses and sayings that per-tain to the messiah and call upon readers to take practical steps to expedite 7 For criticism of these texts and others like them, see Bartal, Exile in the Homeland, 237–295; idem, “Two Schools,” 7–22; Meir, “Light and Vessel,” 206–207; idem, “The Eclectic Kabbalah,” 411–420; Etkes, “The Vilna Gaon,” 69–114; Baumgarten, “Messiah ben Joseph in Jerusalem,” 17–19. To this very day, there are some Israeli scholars who use these “traditions” for political and religious leverage, in lieu of a sober historical viewpoint.8 Moshe Slatky, Sefer Ner Moshe, 85a–88b.9 Malachi, “Petaḥ Tiqṿa,” 19–20."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"chapter 4100<UN>the messiah’s coming and avoid behavior that is liable to delay it.10 These pam-phlets, most of which are no longer than four pages, lack so much as a single feasible idea, and their intention is rather vague. Correspondingly, HaKimchi printed an eight-page flyer, “An Appeal,” praising the Zikhron Yerushalayim booklets by Refael Yitzchak Yisrael. It opens with the words “Pay heed O con-scientious ones from among our brethren the Jewish people; now after it was clarified to us by the booklet Zikhron Yerushalayim which was printed here in the holy city by Rabbi Moshe Yehoshua HaKimchi, and we have been persua-sively convinced that the idea making the rounds among the masses whereby the redemption must come to pass without a conscious effort, is without truth and is riddled with doubts.” Therefore, he reaches the conclusion that it is im-perative to form “Fathers-to-Sons-Committees” that will inspire “the simple masses” to ratchet up their observance of the commandments and study Torah in synagogues. Moreover, he urged his audience to support a recently estab-lished organization, Anshei Ma’amad, that he was affiliated with.11 It appears that HaKimchi’s plan assumed a completely new form in 1898, as the obscure content of his pamphlets was interpreted as a call to search for the Lost Tribes. Likewise, he recruited the Anshei Ma’amad society to help prepare a flyer pro-moting this idea. As noted, the other signatory of Horowitz’s pamphlet “Drishat Kevod Ḥakhmei haTorah” was Shlomo Wechsler – a kabbalist from Germany that settled Palestine and became a Bratslav Hasid. Like several other members of his family, Wechsler was stricken with messianic fever.1210 HaKimchi, Quntres Zikhron Yerushalayim, vols. 1–2 (1890); idem Ma’amar heMesukam (1890). Some of his notices-pamphlets from around 1930 can be found in Halevy, The First Jerusalem Books, items 665, 703–705.11 Refael Yiṣḥaq Yisrael, Qol Qore (1890).12 Gershom Scholem expounds on the Wechsler family through the generations. Two of its members, who became Bratslav Hasidim in Palestine, possessed a fiery messianic streak and were engrossed with kabbalah literature. Scholem briefly described the outlooks of R. Binyamin and R. Shlomo (whose daughter married R. Yehuda Tzvi Brandwein, a disciple of Yehuda Leib Ashlag), and drew on the memoirs of the latter from the 1930s. However, Scholem put an emphasis on their origins, neglecting their new surroundings in Jeru-salem. See Scholem, “Die Letzten Kabbalisten in Deutschland,” 218–246. R. Shlomo was, inter alia, one of R. Kook’s fiercest opponents. For more on this figure, see Strauss, The Rosenbaums of Zell, 43–50; Anschin, Sipurim Yerushalmim, 73–86; Malachi, “A Voyage to Zion,” 391–392 (who described R. Shlomo as a Hasid and activist with a wild head of hair, red curls, and a beard to match); Porush, Sharsheret haDorot, vol. 1, 210–211; Goralitz and Bratsaver, “Ḥasid Mufla ’Ala meGermaniya,” 84–91. Wechsler frequently comes up in the writing of Bratslav Hasidim, like Yisroel Ber Odesser and Shmuel Horowitz. R. Binyamin encapsulated his own worldview in an exceptional pamphlet that contains hints of mes-sianic issues, calculations of the End for the year 1905, solutions to dreams (including those in which he was a messianic figure) and various matters concerning the Ten Tribes,"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"101The Search For The Lost Tribes<UN>Horowitz teamed up with these two figures on the matter of the Ten Tribes, adding the link to the kabbalistic spheres to this collaboration. Although the three largely diverged with respect to the kabbalah, they were united by a fer-vent desire to find the lost Israelites. Their jointly-written pamphlet relates the chance encounter of a Jew from Sana’a, Aharon HaKohen Sofer, who was among the Yemenite immigrants of 1881–1882, with a Rechabite near the port of al-Ghaydah. Sofer told the authors that this mysterious figure could help them reach the Sambatyon without difficulty. Moved by this story, the activ-ists established a society, Dorshei Kevod Hakhmei haTorah, that was devoted to raising funds for a three-month expedition. Included in their budget was the cost of producing a Torah scroll, which the explorers would take with them for the Israelites. Yosef Chaim Zonnenfeld’s son, Avraham Aharon, was appointed the secretary of this new outfit. According to the three founders, they were supported by Shmuel Salant, the chief rabbi of Jerusalem, and Refael Yitzchak Yisrael. Among the institutional sponsors listed on this pamphlet are Shomrei Miṣvot veAnshei Ma’amad and Ḥevrat Ezrat haKohanim veHalevy’im beEzrat Yisrael.13 While the ideas promulgated therein merited the backing of quite a few rabbis, as discussed below they were also subjected to a great deal of ridi-cule, both in the Yishuv and beyond.14Soon enough, an itinerary was formulated and special flyers were distributed calling on Jews to support this mission. In 1899, Horowitz penned a special ap-peal titled “Et le’Vakesh” (A Time to Ask), which was endorsed by distinguished rabbis in Jerusalem. Among the tens of notables who backed the expedition were the rabbis and kabbalists Shmuel Salant, Yosef Chaim Zonnenfeld, Yaa-kov Moshe Charlap, Yehoshua Tzvi Michel Shapira, Aharon Shlomo Maharil, Akiva Yosef Schlesinger, and Refael Yitzchak Yisrael.15 What is more, these fig-ures signed an epistle that was addressed to “the Sons of Moshe.” According to one tradition, the letter was penned by HaKimchi.16which he believed were located in China and Japan; Binyamin Wechsler, Mizbai’aḥ Bin-yamin. According to Malachi, he dubbed himself “Benjamin the Drowsy Youth” and pro-claimed himself the Messiah ben David at the Sixth Zionist Congress; ibid, 392. See Meir, “Die Letzten Kabbalisten,” 243–258.13 Drishat Kevod Ḥakhmei haTorah (1898).14 For instance, see the derisive account of the society’s establishment in the newspaper HaMagid 1898; Ben Yerushalayim, “Letters from Jerusalem,” 319–320.15 “Et leVaqesh! Qra Yesh’a le’Am Nedava,” 1899 (announcement). All of these notices called on readers to support the explorers. Years later, Horowitz reprinted them in idem, Kol Mevaser, 72–77. In the second introduction, he revealed that he was the author.16 The wording of the letter, along with the rabbis’ signatures, was reprinted in Horowitz, Kol Mevaser, 75–77.

In 1899, they printed two booklets that are tied to this journey. The first, Mevaseret Ṣiyon (Herald of Zion), does not even allude to the new undertaking, but consists entirely of letters that discuss the Tribes and earlier search expeditions. It is divided into the following short chapters: (a) Précis of the Writ that Jerusalem’s Sages Sent to the Cities of the Diaspora; (b) Copy of the Writ Sent by the Sons of Moses beyond the Sambatyon River to the Tribes of Judah and Benjamin in Jerusalem; (c) Précis of the Letter Sent to the Ashkenazic Scholars in the Land of Israel by the Sons of Moses and the Ten Tribes. In all likelihood, the objec-tive behind the publication of these letters was to drum up public support for their trek.17 The second booklet contains the famous epistle of the Vilna Gaon’s student, R. Yisrael of Shklov, to the Ten Tribes. In this letter, the author drew a correlation between the reinstitution of rabbinic ordination (smikha) and the finding of the lost Israelites. Most interestingly, this document summarizes R. Yisrael’s outlook according to which the Tribes possess esoteric secrets, but are unfamiliar with more recent additions to the body of kabbalah wisdom. With this in mind, the author promised to reveal secrets to the Israelites that he had heard from the Vilna Gaon and forward them his own writings along with those of HaARI.18 Besides R. Yisrael’s epistle, the anonymous editor (none other than Horowitz) added the aforementioned Et le’Vakesh, thereby inform-ing readers of the upcoming journey. He also included a few words on a new association, Agudat Shivtei Yeshurun (the Association of the Tribes of Jeshu-run), “the likes of which has never been.” The final item in the booklet was an announcement of a forthcoming work by Horowitz with new information on the Tribes. However, it would only come out in 1923, well after the quest.19 This is how Horowitz described the preparations for the mission:In the year 1899 the awakening from below commenced and the Court of Justice and other Jerusalem rabbis swept into action and wrote ap-peals and letters of awakening to our brethren in the Diaspora.

However, his workload was ratched up two-fold. The kabbalist-cum-explorer’s mandate was no longer merely to find the lost Israelites, but to fundraise on behalf of institutions in Jerusalem (including the Eṣ Ḥayyim Yeshiva and the Diskin Orphanage). To this end, he was charged with presenting “before our nation’s patrons the situation in the Holy Land in general, particularly in all that concerns the strengthening of the pillar of Torah for Zion and for Jerusalem.”21 Accompanying Horowitz was a Yemenite-Jewish dreamer by the name of Zadok Friedman (an adopted sir name), who in the Old Yishuv was widely believed to have had far-reaching visions – along the same lines of the Yemenite seers and dreamers in Haim Hazaz’s stories – about the Tribes and their dwelling place.22 Based on a firsthand acquaintance with Friedman, the explorer-cum-geographer Abraham Jacob Brawer described him as “a religious Don Quixote that set out to find the Ten Tribes.” Moreover, he noted that the Yemenite mystic “married an Ashkenazic woman, dressed like an Ashkenazi from the Old Yishuv, and even spoke Yiddish and affixed to his name a typical Ashkenazic sir name.” What is more, Brawer witnessed him belittling “the frankin” (Franks) – a disparaging term for Sephardim.23After several months of wandering between major Jewish communities in the Far East and striking up conversations with people that they happened to come across on the road, the two explorers returned to Jerusalem with handsome sums of money for the city’s institutions and its poor, but without 20 Horowitz, Kol Mevaser, second introduction.21 For more on this trip, see Horowitz, Kol Mevaser, 74–75; Ya’ari, “Emissaries of the Land of Israel to the Lost Tribes,” 482.22 Zadok Friedman’s name comes up in letters of recommendation by Jerusalem-based rab-bis, which Horowitz included in Kol Mevaser.23 Brawer, Zikhronot Av uBeno, 461–462. An interesting tradition about Friedman has been preserved in the Israel Folktales Archive. However, the author of this source was unaware of the fact that this was the dreamer who accompanied Horowitz to the Far East; Harel-Ḥoshen and Avner, Beyond the Sambatyon, 25.

From Horowitz’s itinerary, it is evident that he did not attempt to venture beyond the large population cen-ters and explore the countryside. At each destination, the kabbalist made do with taking notes and accumulating rumors.24 Years later, he claimed that the trip was cut short due to budget constraints (and perhaps the presence of the Jewish wayfarers raised suspicions among the local authorities).25 In addition, one of Horowitz’s relatives told Brawer that “Members of his family turned to a rabbinical court in Jerusalem and by dint of telegrams from the rabbis per-suaded the romantic to return from India, but he continued to hold out hope [that one day he would] reach the Ten Tribes. And Reb Zadok came back with him.”26Horowitz and Friedman’s inability to make much headway in all that con-cerns the Lost Tribes only intensified Wechsler and HaKimchi’s desire to organize another delegation. In around 1903, they established a society called Dorshei Tov (Seekers of Good) for the purpose of laying the groundwork for new search expeditions. Surprisingly enough, Horowitz’s name does not come up in Wechsler’s and HaKimchi’s communications on this matter. On account of the first voyage’s shortcomings, Dorshei Tov apparently explored different options. In a 1903 notice titled “Mevaseret Yerushalayim,” Wechsler and HaKimchi em-braced a tradition that is connected to the Vilna Gaon and promoted the book Dorshei Kevod Hakhmei haTorah, which had come out earlier. Furthermore, they claimed that “new paths to that river [i.e., the Sambatyon] have come to our attention,” so that steps must be taken to drum up financial support for a new expedition. Despite falling short of expectations, Horowitz and Fried-man’s journey remained fresh in their minds. “Since we regularly speak about it [i.e., the maiden journey], we are also obligated to remind you dear broth-ers that your pure hearts should not be tempted to say Travelers have indeed already travelled on this matter and did not manage to accomplish their mis-sion. You should also know that another reason for” their failure was “the lack of enough money for the trip’s expenses.” In the meantime, “clearer, better, and safer routes” have been discovered. The appeal’s signatories were HaKimchi, Wechsler, Rephael Mordechai Yitzchak Shapira, and Yehoshua Epstein, all of whom identified themselves as activists of the organizations Dorshei Tov and 24 See the short description of the itinerary in Ya’ari, “Emissaries of the Land of Israel to the Lost Tribes,” 483–484.25 Horowitz, Kol Mevaser, 51: “Acutely shallow pockets, etc. left [sic] me from reaching my desired goal, and I suffered from want from every side and other sorts of delays until I was forced to return against my will.”26 Brawer, Zikhronot Av uBeno, 462."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"105The Search For The Lost Tribes<UN>Shomrei Miṣvot.27 That same year, they reissued the booklet Mevaseret Ṣiyon, which as above-noted first came out in 1899 and consisted of erstwhile letters with references to the Ten Tribes.28 Once again, the purpose behind the dis-semination of this work was to “market” another search expedition. However, this initiative never came to fruition. Renewed Attempts and the Sha’ar haShamayim Information CenterNotwithstanding Horowitz’s disappointment with the results of the maiden voyage and his exclusion from the second undertaking, he evidently sought to raise funds for another expedition throughout the rest of his life. In other words, the kabbalist’s desire to complete what he had begun never waned. It is with this goal in mind that he published his 1923 book, Kol Mevaser (Voice of Annunciation). This work outlines the itinerary of his trip and offers a cap-tivating account of his adventures in the Far East.29 Moreover, it provides in-formation on the Ten Tribes, which draws heavily on the extensive research lit-erature (in Hebrew, German, and English) and various rumors. Horowitz also elaborates on theories concerning the Israelites’ whereabouts and previous at-tempts to find them. In addition, Kol Mevaser includes a detailed English sum-mary of the possible locations, with the following heading: “A Call of Love to all our Brethren the Sons of Israel Awaiting their Speedy Redemption (An Extract from the Book The Voice of Annunciation [Kol Mevaser] and a Short Summary of All the Places Mentioned in the Book).” Affixed to the book are riveting ap-provals by Abraham Isaac Kook and Yaakov Moshe Charlap, who passionately sought to justify the scarce resources that were allocated to these endeavors. Both rabbis stressed that finding the lost brethren constitutes a pivotal stage in the redemption process.3027 “Mevaseret Yerushalayim” (announcement).

Alternatively, some of the material was in-corporated between 1912 and 1914. Impressions from the maiden journey are scattered throughout the book, above all pages 72–77.

In Horowitz’s estimation, the realization of these three goals was a prerequisite of the “awakening from below” that will precede the redemption. Furthermore, he undertook “to rouse up God’s people from their slumber so that they may fully atone for their sins, shake off the dust, and reju-venate themselves.” These steps, he claimed, “must be initiated by us, especially in such a period” when “all the signs that our sages of blessed memory proph-esized ahead of time regarding the heels of the Messiah have come to pass.” It is clear to him “that the hand of God is touching the global renaissance in all that concerns the building of the Land and the return of the banished.” What is more, he urged his readers to uproot the causes that are stalling the redemp-tion by means of “study and action, in word and in deed,” namely by learning kabbalah and searching for the Tribes. Horowitz felt that he had fulfilled the first obligation by establishing the Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva. Consequently, the time was ripe to tend to the search for the lost brothers with the same en-ergy, while harnessing the seminary to this task.31 From Horowitz’s standpoint, a Jew must commit himself to delving into the mysteries of the Torah and brac-ing himself for the End of the Days with equal ardor. “The Jewish people must endeavor with all our might to do things that cause the in-gathering of the exiles. When we unite into one nation, then” the shekhinah will immerse it-self “and the glory of yesteryear shall be restored.”32 Horowitz summed up his words with the following exhortations: “Let us rouse ourselves for the purpose of searching far and wide and finding our brethren, the brave and righteous ones of whom the Vilna Gaon says are none other than the saviors.”33Aside for recollections of conversations that he had in distant lands and information garnered from scholars and books as to the Tribes’ whereabouts, Horowitz’s work is saturated with bizarre episodes. For instance, while in Ti-bet, the kabbalist saw a couple of bearded figures donning long black garments out in the distance. Believing that he had stumbled upon the lost Jews, Horow-itz jubilantly ran towards them, only to discover that the monks could not un-derstand a word he was saying.34 Although this exchange can be interpreted in a satirical fashion, Horowitz certainly brought it up in earnest. However, as discussed below, others latched on to these sort of anecdotes for the purpose of disparaging the Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva and its ideas.31 Horowitz, Kol Mevaser, author’s introduction.32 Ibid, 9–12.33 Ibid, 105.34 Ibid, 100."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"107The Search For The Lost Tribes<UN>Elsewhere in the book, Horowitz describes an encounter with a Rechabite who came to Palestine in 1913 with news that the Lost Tribes were mobiliz-ing. A special assembly was held at Sha’ar haShamayim in honor of this ex-traordinary visitor. The event attracted throngs of people, including a few of Jerusalem’s most respected kabbalists. Among the attendees were Tzvi Pesach Frank, Charlap, Yaakov Meir Zonnenfeld, Horowitz, and Auerbach. The digni-taries signed an epistle that was intended for the Sons of Moses and the Ten Tribes, which was submitted to that same mysterious guest. Be that as it may, according to Horowitz, the hardships of the Great War ultimately thwarted this attempt to contact the lost Israelites.35 These sort of encounters were not alien to the era’s readers. At around this time, Akiva Yosef Schlesinger (among the few kabbalists of Beit El who had backed Horowitz’s expedition) reported of the arrival of a kabbalist from Tibet by the name of R. Eliezer ben Rabbi Shi-mon Moshe in Eastern Europe. This so-called “disappearing man,” showed up in 1865 at the house of R. Hillel Lichtenstein in Kolomyia (a city in Galicia), where he performed marvels in theoretical and practical kabbalah. What is more, this figure was deemed to be an emissary of the Lost Tribes and was thus entrusted with a letter to deliver to his compatriots. However, the Tibetan took off without leaving a word.36 Unlike the well-documented stay of the Rech-abite in Jerusalem, though, Schlesinger was the only one to offer testimony of this visit.Kol Mevaser’s readers were also urged to establish chapters in all cities with Jewish communities of an association that would conduct research on and search for the lost Israelites. Dubbed the Tribes of Jeshurun Association, each branch would select “Explorers-travelers, fit and honest people who observe the Sabbath and the law of Torah.” If these goals were met, Horowitz averred, the Lost Tribes would eventually be found. Pursuant to this plan, Sha’ar ha-Shamayim would serve as a sort of central data repository.37 The first extant 35 Ibid, 78–84.

Yisrael of Shklov’s famous epis-tle to the Ten Tribes in the organization’s name.38 However, this time around, it seems as though only Horowitz operated within the Association’s framework. Over a decade later, the group sponsored a new edition of Moses Edrehi’s Se-fer Ma’aseh Nissim (1911). This edition featured an introduction, “Ma’amar kid-dush ha’shem,” on the obligation to search for the Ten Tribes by R. Mordechai Berkovitz.39 Like Horowitz, the writer associated himself with “the Vilna Ga-on’s traditions.” In fact, Berkowitz’s father, Avraham Dov, authored a couple of works on the famed rabbi’s kabbalistic thought. This introduction also attests to the large network of relations between kabbalists in Jerusalem. Father and son arrived to Palestine in 1899, but the former passed away the next year. Mor-dechai was among the sages of Sha’ar haShamayim and an active proponent of finding the Ten Tribes.40 On the inner cover of Berkowitz’s introduction is the following preamble: “We the founders of the Association of the Tribes of Jeshurun ask of our brethren the Jewish people wherever they may reside to found a society like this in each and every city and to unite with our society. In so doing, may we reach our goal of finding our brethren, the Sons of Moses our Rabbi, may peace be upon him and may his virtue protect us.”41As we shall see, Horowitz was a sucker for any new piece of information on the Tribes’ whereabouts that happened to come his way, regardless of the source. It thus stands to reason that Zevi Kasdoi (a scholar who broached many and manifold theories of his own on this topic) was referring to Horowitz in the following passage from his 1928 book, The Tribes of Jacob and the Preserved of Israel:Once while I was heading somewhere for the purpose of my literary work, I lost my way among the winding and crooked alleys of Old Jerusalem, etc. That day there was a downpour. In several places, I could not traverse the puddles that were caused by these torrents of rain, and I did not run to me, for those with shaven beards will not give permission to engage in dialogue with them;” ibid, 52.38 Shivtei Yeshurun, Igeret (1899), 14–16.39 Edrehi, Sefer Ma’ase Nisim, 3–9.40 Berkowitz, Sefer Zekher Avraham.

The copy in the Israel National Library has been inscribed with the following seal: “The Company of the Tribes of Jeshurun Association with the Sons of Moshe our Teacher, may peace be upon him, may his virtue protect us, here in the Holy City of Jerusalem, may it be built and instituted swiftly in our time amen.”"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"109The Search For The Lost Tribes<UN>into anyone along the way to ask for directions. Suddenly, there material-ized opposite me, as though surfacing from beneath the depths of the earth, a typical Jerusalemite Jew. He urged me to give him a hand, to join him in his search for the Ten Tribes, particularly the sons of Jonadab ben Rechab.... Before I knew it, he had dragged me all the way to the West-ern Wall, and swore to me time and again that he had seen one of them with his own eyes next to the Western Wall, which we are [sic] standing by. And he told me that he ran after me for about a half hour, for this reason[:] “You became an expert, my good man, on trips, etc.” He then turned to me with a beaming face, and he described to me such a trip and its plan etc., like a big and knowledgeable expert. He even learnt Arabic for this sake, and how to dress up as a dervish. However – he added with a sigh – so long as scholars and experts do not partake in this [i.e., the search for the Tribes], they will stigmatize the enterprise even now with tall tales and illusions etc. I indeed promised [to lend] him [a hand], but the World War came and the opportunity fell by the wayside.42Owing to his expeditions to the Far East (including Japan and China), Kasdoi was probably solicited for advice by members of the Old Yishuv with an inter-est in the Lost Tribes.43 In a similar fashion, Abraham Jacob Brawer described how a person loosely affiliated with Sha’ar haShamayim turned to him with questions concerning the Tribes’ whereabouts.44In all likelihood, many of Horowitz’s contemporaries were familiar with both his voyage and dreams. Aharon Zeev Aešcoly, who touched on the former in a couple of books, also described the itinerant kabbalist in his 1936 article “The Jews of Abyssinia in Hebrew Literature,” with blatant scorn:The extent to which the Jewish people is not a widower [i.e., is not the sole believer] in the myths on the Ten Tribes and their eagerness to search for them to this day is evidenced by the story of R.

Additionally, he provides information on the Falasha [i.e., Ethiopian Jewry], and he is ready to head off to Abyssinia and find them on his own. From his standpoint, he is certain that the Falasha, some of whom he saw in Jerusalem, are not the same Jews in-habiting Abyssinia that descend from the ten Tribes. They have yet to be found to this day [according to Horowitz] because a clean-shaven Jew was dispatched to them. For his part, Rabbi Horowitz is ready to go there on an expedition.45This passage refers to Horowitz’s theory that the Tribes are residing in an un-known location in Ethiopia, which he developed in Kol Mevaser.46 In fact, the kabbalist took steps to substantiate this new hypothesis. The archive of Jacob Noah Faitlovitch (1881–1955), a Zionist activist who supported Ethiopian Jewry in a variety of ways throughout the early twentieth century, contains a most interesting, circa 1928 letter from Horowitz that sheds light on his outlook to-wards searching for the Tribes.47 Above all, the epistle indicates how its author was galvanized by every last morsel of information that found its way to his doorstep, even if it pointed to a completely different geographic location than the one he had previously considered. The letter was a follow-up to the copy of Kol Mevaser that he sent to Faitlovitch:I am writing to inform your honor that I spoke with a famous doctor and explorer, Dr. Entin, who was a physician in the British Army. Eight years ago, he travelled with a convoy to Abyssinia and wanted to find out the truth about our brethren, the lost Jews. The Dr. passed on to me a true piece of information from what he researched from the Negroes. They 45 Aešcoly, “The Jews of Abyssinia,” 433–434. Aešcoly enumerated and rebuked the myriad authors who identified the Jews of Ethiopia with the Ten Tribes. His article concludes on the following note: “The sources that they cite bear witness on themselves. Some are non-sense, in which the thin rumor of truth is nullified by a sea of fantasy. Among them are also texts that have a foundation of truth in their own right – but there is no endorsable truth on Abyssinia’s Jews, only on other exiles.... The Jewish sources are the fruit of an on-going rumor.... None of these travelers were in Abyssinia itself, even David Reubeni, the only one that was suspected of this. In general, this material reflects the Diaspora’s atti-tude towards the exiled of Israel across the generations – and is not reflective of historical material on the history of the Falasha” (433–435).46 Horowitz, Kol Mevaser, 26–27, 35–36, 106–107; English section, 2–3.47 On Faitlovitch and his contribution to the search for the Sons of Moses, see Ben-Dor Benite, The Ten Lost Tribes, 219–220; Trevisan Semi, Jacques Faitlovitch and the Jews of Ethiopia, 1–46."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"111The Search For The Lost Tribes<UN>revealed to him information about every part of the place, including the mountains and the Abtara River. The Dr. himself crossed the Atbara River and wanted to climb the Semien Mountains in order to reach the king of Israel, for the Gentiles themselves told him that they know for a fact that many brave Jews dwell in the Semien Mountains. And they themselves told him that the Sambatyon River is to be found there as well. [The wa-terway] slings rocks and sand in a raging wind throughout the six days of the workweek, and rests and stops working on the Holy Sabbath. It is quite a difficult path to reach these mountains. [On this note,] he [i.e., Entin] concludes his words. And I [Horowitz] am certain that if they ar-range a trustworthy delegation to go there and search for our brethren, they will surely manage to find them. For this Dr. himself crossed the At-bara River and wanted to proceed to the mountains, but the convoy did not want to, and he was left the only one. Therefore, he too was forced to go back.

Many thanks in advance.48There is no evidence as to the fate of this plan, or if Faitlovitch, who was quite interested in finding the tribes for his own nationalist reasons, so much as re-sponded to Horowitz’s letter. To the best of our knowledge, the Zionist activist did not take this particular matter all too seriously and made no effort to secure a bottle of sand from the fabled river. Once again, a scheme devised by Horow-itz went awry,49 but there would be others who picked up where he left off. Following in Horowitz’s FootstepsHorowitz sought to resuscitate the Tribes of Jeshurun Association in 1923 within the framework of the Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva, but it is difficult to measure the organization’s activity level or how many people responded to his calls. That said, one can point to several figures that were moved by Horowitz’s efforts and formed ties with him. Furthermore, several books that came out in the late 1800s and first half of the twentieth century are infused with his can-do zeal.A case in point is R. Jacob Goldzweig’s 1896 book Igeret leKeṣ haYamin, which includes various calculations that date the messiah’s coming to 1906 and the adjacent years (as discussed below, this forecast was often put forth by Horow-itz as well).50 According to Goldzweig, he discovered the date of “God’s shab-bat and the messiah’s coming in the present” from a shelved manuscript by R. Hayyim Vital, which he came across in Haifa in 1865. Moreover, Igeret leKeṣ haY-amin advocates purchasing land in Palestine as a catalyst for the redemption. 48 The section that pertains to Ethiopian Jewry and the Tribes was published by Waldman, From Ethiopia to Jerusalem, 130–131.49 Reuveni portrays such a plan in one of his fictional stories; idem, “Pi haGiḥon [1934],” 372–381.50 Goldzweig, Sefer Igeret leQeṣ haYamin. First published in Manchester in 1896, the book was quite popular, as new editions came out in Munkacs and Piotrków in 1898 and 1905, respectively."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"113The Search For The Lost Tribes<UN>In a section titled “Wonderful News from the Ten Tribes and the Construction of the Temple,” he claimed that the redemption is drawing near: “The Holy One blessed be He will subsequently open a route between the snow-capped mountains, and the Ten Tribes will be able to go up to the Land of Israel and see the Temple that the Holy One blessed be He will bring down from the heav-ens and the Holy Land will expand more than it is now.”51 The book came out, albeit anonymously, a few more times. From 1897 and on, the Munkacs edi-tions of Igeret leKeṣ haYamin included an approval by Shmuel Salant.52Similar ideas, albeit with a slightly different worldview, turn up in Judah Leib ben Yosef Zeitlin’s 1901 Sefer Pirqei Neḥamot Ṣiyon. This book, which was printed in Jerusalem, is outfitted with approvals from rabbis and kabbalists, a letter by Sons of Moshe, and various calculations of the End.53 Zeitlin pro-posed the establishment of “holy groups” by the name of Kiseh Eliyahu54 that would fast, pray, study the Zohar and Psalms, and hold other Lurian-style ritu-als on a regular basis for the sake of hastening the messiah’s arrival. What is more, he integrated the topic of the Lost Tribes into the kabbalistic yearnings for the redemption.During the 1930s, the kabbalist Moshe Yair Weinstock, who would eventually become one of Yehuda Leib Ashlag’s top students, put out two small booklets containing, among other topics, information on “the places in which the Ten Tribes are scattered to announce from them [sic] wondrous marvels and ter-rifying deeds.”55 In 1956, he wrote a comprehensive work about the obligation to search for the Tribes. While drawing on Horowitz’s enterprise, Weinstock’s 51 Ibid, 25–26.52 In another edition, which came out in Piotrków 1905, a phrase describing the utopian state in the Land of Israel – “And there the boys and girls will study, Torah and wisdom in three languages” – has been replaced with the following: “And there the boys will study Torah and wisdom.” ibid, 19.53 Zeitlin, Sefer Pirqei Neḥamot Ṣiyon, 10b–12b.54 Ibid, 20b. Zeitlin interspersed passages from rare kabbalah books throughout this work. On the matter of the groups, it appears that he was leaning on Eliyahu Suliman Mani, Sefer Kise Eliyahu (1865), 76a: “Let us talk of an attribute of this generation’s savants, as a duty has been imposed on them from heaven’s law to make an effort to conduct this tikun. For this purpose, they will appoint six shifts in Jerusalem. Every shift consists of God-fearing men and each shift will fast one day a week, night and day. And they will pray on behalf of the entire Jewish people and for the redemption. Every day they will study Psalms and Zohar in particular. And in his mercy the Holy One will send us a savior quickly in our time amen, may this be His will.”55 Weinstock, Sifrei Yisrael (1): Sefer Darkhei Ṣiyon; idem, Sifrei Yisrael (2): Sefer Igeret Haqodesh. The two booklets were printed at the HaYOM Press (the Hebrew acronym of the author’s full name and title). Weinstock’s role as publisher is only mentioned on the"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"chapter 4114<UN> motives for locating the Israelites were completely different than his precur-sor’s, as his largely stem from the Holocaust and the need to bolster the fledg-ling Jewish state:I believe that in this epoch which, due to our many sins, we [sic] have lost over six million of our brethren the Jewish people, from the cream of the crop, because of the Nazi Holocaust, may their [i.e., the Nazis’] names be eradicated, and our people dwelling in our holy land are surrounded by thirty million Arabs [who are our] sworn haters [sic]. Now the time has long come for us, the members of the tribe of Judah and Benjamin and some Levites, to get cracking on the sacred work: to search for our broth-ers the Ten Tribes and the Sons of Moses.56This militant passage indeed epitomizes the changes to the rationale behind finding the Lost Tribes in the aftermath of the Holocaust and Israel’s establish-ment. Years later, these sort of utterances helped nourish fundamentalist views in the State of Israel.57 During the pre-war years, many and manifold reasons were cited for pursuing this goal. For example, in 1935, Tzvi Hirsch Shapira (the aforementioned Hasidic rabbi of Munkacs) stressed that finding our “perfect, pure, and trembling” lost brethren would strengthen the resolve of the major-ity of the Jewish people against “the secular sinners and the rebels” in their midst:The aliyah of the Tribes – If perhaps, God forbid, the plaintiff will devi-ate and say that owing to our many sins criminals and rebels came out of klal yisrael [the Jewish people in its entirety] and they constitute the majority. Only the minority still strengthen themselves in Torah and the believer’s faith. If so, most of the Jewish people, heaven forbid, are bad, and this would push the scales towards a guilty verdict. Therefore, we will duly join forces with the Ten Tribes, who are pure people. All of them are saints and among them are certainly those who will tremble before God and who are believers. They would constitute the majority with which to defeat the evil. And this is an aliyah, to expand the population. [In other back cover of the second booklet. These were the first of over eighty titles that he brought to press in his lifetime.56 Weinstock, Shnem Asar Shivtei Yisrael, 8. In the days ahead, Avraham Eliyahu Zonenshein became involved in Horowitz’s enterprise. In 1958, he established an association, “New Light in Zion,” that was devoted to finding the Lost Tribes; idem, Sefer Or Ḥadash beṢiyon.57 See, for example, Halkin, Across the Sabbath River."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"115The Search For The Lost Tribes<UN>words,] the Ten Tribes along with the Sons of Moses from beyond the Sambatyon will be untied with Yisrael in the Diaspora. With them, we [i.e., observant Jews] are the majority against the wicked; and together we would be able to push the scales in our favor and for good.58During these same years, David Aharon Wishnevitz’s 1930 article on the finding the Ten Tribes was quite popular in Eastern Europe. The book in which it was published merited approvals from Judah Leo Landau, Kook, and other rabbis who were close to Sha’ar haShamayim.59 Another book on this topic, Meṣiat Aseret haShvatim (Discovery of the Ten Tribes), netted a few editions in He-brew and Yiddish in the early 1900s.60 Its cover boasts of huge revelations on the matter of one Uziel Haga’s discovery of the Sambatyon River in China, but the work itself is merely a compilation of several earlier texts. Put differ-ently, the promises on the cover were, at best, an exaggerated sales pitch.61Horowitz’s journey indeed made waves, as many readers adopted his out-look and sought to organize expeditions. Among the “new converts” was the kabbalist R. Menachem Menkhin Rabinowitz. During the 1920s and 1930s, he brought to press about twelve kabbalah-related pamphlets that clamored 58 Shapira, Quntres Divrei Qodesh, 6.59 Wishnevitz, “Meṣiat ’Aseret haShvatim,” in Sefer Mate Aharon, 77a–103b.60 Haga, Meṣiat ’Aseret haShvatim. The first edition came out in 1901 in Warsaw. A Yiddish edition, with changes and omissions (mostly references to philosophical works), followed in its wake, idem, Erfundung die eseres shvotim. In 1911, the book was reprinted in Hebrew and Yiddish under the title The New Testament, or Sefer haBrit haḤadash.61 The anonymous publisher fused together several different elements: articles in HaMagid on the Jews of China (Haga, Meṣiat ’Aseret haShvatim, 3–17), the editor’s description of Haga (“his soul longs deeply to enter a pact with our brethren, the descendants of the Ten Tribes who were severed from us [by means of ] a huge rift that is not healing,” ibid, 17–18); and an account of China from the writings of the nineteenth century author Shim-shon Bloch, which Haga adapted into an epistle (ibid, 18–56). The first to take note of the book’s peculiarities and uncited sources was Lazar, Ḥidot haHagadot, 91: “After the final war between the powerful kingdoms in China, some loafer published a book in Warsaw by the name Meṣiat ’Aseret haShvatim”. On the book’s cover, he declared that “the explorer Uziel Haga of Boston got a license from the president of the United States Mc Kinley [sic], to go with his army to China in the year 1901. He provides cutting evidence that the Jews in China are descendants of the Ten Tribes and will expand on the matter of the Sambatyon River. However, inside the book, there is nothing on this topic, save for the above-mentioned letters from the year 1868 [which were published in HaMagid] and the writing on the land of China as per the book Shvilei Olam of Shimshon Bloch].” As op-posed to Ben-Dor Benite (The Ten Lost Tribes, 215–219), I contend that this entire story is a fabrication; and the same can probably be said for the figure of Uziel Haga."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"chapter 4116<UN>for repentance. These texts also contain various allusions to the Ten Tribes. In 1928, Rabinowitz merged all the existing pamphlets into a comprehensive book: Sefer Mevasser veOmer Neḥamat Menaḥem.62 Consisting of Hebrew and English sections, the book offers various details about the Tribes (including a bibliographical list on the pertinent literature and maps), which were gleaned from research and travel books. In so doing, he hoped to reignite the search for the lost brethren. He even called on Jews with a working knowledge of Arabic and Far Eastern tongues to help him assemble a delegation. In parallel, Rabi-nowitz was involved in calculating the End of the Days. Most of his forecasts gravitated around the year 1930.63 The English section of his book entreats the nations of the world to help find the Tribes. To this end, it provides handwrit-ten maps and directions. It also bears noting that the author placed stock on bizarre theories that were popular at the time, such as the notion that the Eng-lish descend from the Israelites.6462 Rabinowitz, Sefer Mevasser veOmer. The English title of the book is The Lost Tribes of Isra-el. Part 1: A Call in Time and the Redemption of Israel, a Critical Analysis, Scientific, Histori-cal and Biblical Investigation. It also bears noting that the author signs off with the English name “Dr. Menahem Mendel Emanuel ben Abraham, Rabbi, Historian and Traveler.” For a short discussion on Rabinowitz, see Ben-Dor Benite, The Ten Lost Tribes, 221–222.63 Rabinowitz, Sefer Mevasser veOmer, 25–26. The rest of the calculations are for the years 1931, 1939, 1940, and 1955. Some of these forecasts reprise in another of his books; idem, Sefer Neḥapesa Darkheinu ṿeNashuva (1932). Forecasts for these years were rather com-monplace. For instance, Yehuda Aryeh Leib Eibenschutz of Warsaw dated the messiah’s coming to the years from 1938 to 1940; Sefer petiḥat Sefer Daniel (1937), 13–14. Other ex-amples can be found in Meir, “Wrestling with the Esoteric,” 614.64 For more on these ideas, see, inter alios, Lazar, Ḥidot haHagadot, 5, 98–101. Adolf (Avra-ham) Neubauer summarized these theories back in 1899: “At present, we can only say to those who are searching for the lost Tribes in any part of the United Kingdom-England, Scotland, Wales, or Ireland, what we said some years ago to the late great champion of the theory that the Welsh are the lost Tribes. After expounding for more than half an hour his theory that the Cymri derive their name from Omri, and abusing our great Celtic scholar Professor Rhys for taking another view on grounds of philology and ethnology, he asked our own opinion, which we gave him in the following words: ‘My belief is that you are more lost than the Ten Tribes.’” Idem, “Where Are the Ten Tribes,” 423. Hebrew literature is brimming with scorn for the theories that were broached by the English. For instance, Orlans wrote in 1929 that “We are witness to an interesting spectacle whereby an associa-tion, which counts many of the heads of English society among its members, posits that the British are descendants of the Ten Tribes. And this association holds congresses from time to time and discusses this matter with utmost seriousness.” In the ensuing para-graphs, he lambasted this phenomenon; idem, “Aseret haShvatim Ḥayim ṿeQaya’mim,” 223–224. None other than Joseph Klausner claimed that “along with many illusions and"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"117The Search For The Lost Tribes<UN>Rabinowitz’s grand plans were backed by several of Jerusalem’s notables. Among those who endorsed Mevasser veOmer were Kook, Zonnenfeld, the kabbalist Aryeh Leibish Lifshitz, and the two heads of Sha’ar haShamayim.65 According to the introduction, Rabinowitz first met Horowitz in around 1926, and the latter even defrayed some of the book’s expenses. In turn, Horowitz asked the writer to incorporate several fascinating pieces of information into Mevasser veOmer that had recently come to his attention. A detail of this sort is alluded to in Horowitz’s gushing approval of Rabinowitz’s book:I hereby convey to his honor what I received from the mouth of Mr. Tadger, the vice-counsel of the Wahhabi government from Beirut, when he was in Jerusalem during the year 1926. They [i.e., Tadger’s words] have yet to be published, for my book Kol Mevasser came out earlier, in the year 1923. Among the details that he passed on to me was how to reach the Rechabites’ place, as he himself was sent there by the government. I request that his honor print this in his distinguished book.66Despite Horowitz’s assistance, Rabinowitz did not accommodate his pa-tron’s request. Instead, he promised to include it in a sequel, which never materialized.Auerbach’s lengthy approval of Mevasser veOmer is especially interesting, for it contains his first known statements on finding the Ten Tribes. In fact, this text is the only instance in which Auerbach expressly refers to a connection between the dissemination of the kabbalah and the renewed Jewish interest in their vanished brethren:After they [i.e., the Jews] lost faith in the redemption and the kabbalah wisdom was abandoned in the corner, the sound of throbbing for the re-demption is once again heard. The possessors of sacred thought and feel-ing have awoken and have begun to occupy themselves with the kabbalah wisdom, finding meaning and mystery therein. In addition, the hearts of the Jewish people in all the Diasporas of the Exile have begun to beat and pump for the ancestral land, and the latent aspiration to search for and banalities,” there is “also a kernel of historical-scientific truth” to these suppositions; idem, “Aserert haShvatim,” 177–178. Also see Ben-Dor Benite, The Ten Lost Tribes, 187–198.65 Rabinowitz, Sefer Mevasser veOmer, approvals. Horowitz sanctioned (along with the kab-balists Ze’ev Wolf Ashkenazi and Ovadia Hedaya) another of Rabinowitz’s books, which interprets certain parts of the Zohar; Rabinowitz, Sefer Razin Tmirin (1937).66 Rabinowitz, Sefer Mevasser veOmer, approvals; English section, 5."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"chapter 4118<UN>track down our lost and banished brothers has also been ignited.... The ones that are most excited with this development are all those envision-ing a dream and anticipating the salvation, to strengthen the despondent and resuscitate the laggards.67While evidence on how Mevasser veOmer was received is scarce, Rabinowitz evidently gave copies of his book to various figures that were potentially inter-ested in his gospel. Years later, the author recalled sending the book to Japan and China where, in his estimation, it made quite a splash. Inspired by Mev-asser veOmer, he wrote, “a famous professor from Japan” wrote a lengthy paper demonstrating that “among the Japanese can be found the tribes of Gad and Manasseh.” However, even Rabinowitz, who had no qualms about resorting to his imagination on the subject of the lost Israelites, was hard-pressed to accept this new theory.68As noted, Rabinowitz failed to make good on his promise for an extensive sequel to Mevasser veOmer.69 He did publish a five-page work titled Kuntres Dema’ot veNeḥamot Menaḥem veSeder haGeulah in 1939, but this pamphlet was devoid of new information on the Tribes. Instead it portrays the succes-sion of events that will lead to the messiah’s coming in the year 1940, along with another commitment to writie a full-length book in the future.70 At any rate, these activities exemplify the influence of the ideas that Horowitz ad-vanced within the framework of the Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva as well as the new directions that his acolytes took.67 Ibid.68 Rabinowitz, Sefer Neḥapesa Darkheinu ṿeNashuva, 13. He is apparently referring to the ultra-national syncretist Oyabe Zen’ichirō (1867–1941), who in 1929 published his mag-num opus on the Japanese and the Ten Tribes; see Goodman and Miyazawa, Jews in the Japanese Mind, 65–69. For an in-depth look at the theory that Japanese descend from the Tribes, see Lazar, Ḥidot haHagadot, 101–103; Goodman and Miyazawa, ibid, 37–75; Rots, “Ambiguous Identities,” 315–322. This supposition percolated the Hebrew literature in dif-ferent ways, some of them quite bizarre. In a 1902 book on his visions, Binyamin Wechsler noted that the Tribes are located in China or Japan; Wechsler, Mizbai’aḥ Binyamin.69 Rabinowitz, Sefer Shuvu el haBore, 12. In this work, the author expresses his desire to print his book of visions as well.70 Rabinowitz, Kuntres Dema’ot veNeḥamot, 4: “New information on the Ten Tribes, the Sons of Moses, and the Rechabites, in the vicinity of Tibet, the Sahara Desert, and in the heart of Arabia, and dreams and hints, etc. cannot be put into writing. All those interested in this and correspondents are requested to send stamps, etc., to cover the author’s expens-es.” A forecast dating the messiah’s coming to 1940 is also attributed to Dweck-HaKohen; Shrem, Sefer Sha’arei Raḥamim, 93b–94a."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"119The Search For The Lost Tribes<UN> A Note on “Traditions” Ascribed to the Vilna GaonThese messianic explorers also found ostensible clues as to the whereabouts of the Ten Tribes within Jewish tradition. Most of these figures put an emphasis on hints that backed their theories on “the lost brothers” in the Vilna Gaon’s writings or ideas attributed to him and his disciples. As opposed to the consid-erable Ashkenazic support for the efforts to locate the Israelites, the Sephardic kabbalists rarely displayed sympathy for such plans. In the 1880s, the voyages of one Isaac ben R. Haim Baruch Halevi of Tiberias to the Far East sparked a revival of sorts. Halevi, who believed that the Tribes were tucked away in the vicinity of Tibet, won the confidence of a few patrons in Calcutta and Bombay. While several of the Old Yishuv’s rabbis supported his expedition (e.g., Shlomo Abulafia, the Sephardic rabbi of Tiberias, who gave the explorer a letter ad-dressed to the Sons of Moses), Halevi’s appeal to Jerusalem’s Sephardic rab-bis, including the practitioners of Sharabian mysticism in Beit El, fell on deaf ears.71 The same can be said for the Sephardic kabbalists’ response to Horow-itz’s journey at the turn of the century. In fact, there are hardly any references to the question of the Ten Tribes in their writing. This absence may very well stem from various myths concerning the RaShaSh, Haim de la Rosa, and Haim Yosef David Azulai (the hyda). At a certain point, these figures took various measures to hasten the End of the Days, but received warnings from on high to cease and desist.72 These stories were making the rounds in Jerusalem at the 71 This episode is discussed at length in Ya’ari, “Emissaries of the Land of Israel to the Lost Tribes,” 474–480; idem, Shluḥei Ereṣ Yisrael, 149–150. Throughout the years of his jour-ney (1883–1886), Halevi was ridiculed in the daily Hebrew press. For instance, Israel Dov Frumkin considered him a “sucker” and a “dimwit who is misled into believing anything,” but also “a pure and God-fearing man.” See the string of articles, along with the editor’s comments, that were run in HaBazeleth (1884–1885): (a) “A Remnant of the Ten Tribes;” (b) “A Rabbinical Envoy to the Sambatyon;” (c) “The Rearguard of All the Camps;” and (d) “the Mission to the Sons of Moses.” A neutral account turns up in a letter to HaZefira’s editors by Avraham Shalom Chai Hamoi, “Baghdad,” 97.72 This myth was apparently first published in Ludwig August von Frankel, Yerushalaima (1860), 324–326. In 1932, the newspaper Doar haYom unfurled another version of this myth; de la Rosa, “HaGoalim,” 7. A completely different version appeared in a local Je-rusalem paper in 1939; Asher ben Yisrael, “BeSod Asara,” 2.

Not many have plumbed the depths of his articles and in particular his holy pizmonim [songs], most of which are “a locked garden – a sealed well,” which accord with the kabbalah’s secrets that are de-signed to expedite the redemption by means of building Jerusalem and the aliyah of the Tribes, etc. He descends and pierces [sic] until reaching the depths of the intentions of the prophets and Sages’ callings that are in the revealed and in the concealed [Torah] and in wonderful hints in the most profound of secrets. Blessed be He, I took part in the clarifica-tion and revelation of many of the intentions and hints in the pizmonim. And they contain a great deal [with which] to teach the next generations (“A famous myth also spread in Jerusalem”); Benayahu, “Shivḥei haRav ḤiDA,” 178–198 (who copied Frankl’s words); Alexander-Frizer, The Heart Is a Mirror, 230–235. For dif-ferent versions of this same deed (including the unearthing of material from a ms), see Morgenstern, Mysticism and Messianism, 104–114; Moshe Hillel, “Ma’ase,” 813–817. Per-haps ryaz Margaliot was referring to this same episode in his account of a visit to the Beit El Yeshiva with the Chazon Ish. In the building, he wrote, there is a sort of cave in which “the terrible deed” involving the RaShaSh and “his colleagues” transpired, but it is forbidden to publish a word about it. Instead, it is passed on secretly by word of mouth; Moskowitz, Ḥayei haRashash, 93–94.

All of these concoctions served as a kabbalistic reaction to secular Zionism. In any event, Horowitz was much more flexible than the Rivlins from a theological standpoint. More specifically, he was willing to ex-tract information from a wide array of “sources” – from Jews to non-Jews, from distinguished professors to complete strangers – so long as it strengthened his hypotheses concerning the Ten Tribes, advanced his claims as to the neces-sity of revealing kabbalah secrets, and demonstrated that the redemption was near. In essence, he put forth a highly eclectic national-kabbalistic vision that, to some extent, complemented the gospel of secular Zionism and made sense of the emergent New Yishuv in Palestine.75 A Few Calculations of the EndThroughout his lifetime, Shimon Horowitz backed certain forecasts of the messiah’s coming. Several of the co-rosh yeshiva’s books on this topic provide his own calculations and approvals. In Or haMeir, he averred that 1906 (the year Sha’ar haShamayim was established) would be an eit raṣon (a juncture in which God is willing), thereby adding to a long row of predictions for this year in East Europe.76 Horowitz, though, did not suffice with one prediction. Like other apocalypse predictors, he frequently revised his dates over the course of his lifetime. From his standpoint, then, it would seem that the crux of this 74 Yosef Yehoshua Rivlin, Pizmonei R. Yoshe Rivlin, 11. Also see Yosef Yoel Rivlin, Mea Sha’arim, 119; Vishnetski and Frankentel, Megilat Yosef, 18. On the reliability of these “traditions” see Etkes, “The Vilna Gaon,” 69–114. Auerbach subsequently put forth his own proposal for re-instituting the Sanhedrin. In essence, the matter of the Lost Tribes forms the backdrop for this idea as well. See Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, Letter to Yehuda Yudel Rosenberg (ms); Chaim Yehuda Leib Auerbach, “Teshuva be’Inyan haSanhedrin,” 145–156. His approach closely resembles that of R. Kook.75 See also Meir, “The Eclectic Kabbalah of R. Shimon Zvi Horowitz,” 411–420.76 Horowitz, Ohr haMei’eer, 9a. For more on predictions for this year, see Assaf, “A Messianic Vision,” 52. There were kabbalists, such as Shlomo Elyashiv, who objected to these calcula-tions; see Dablitski, Binu Shnot Dor vaDor, 53.

This interest is epitomized by an odd story concerning the eccentric messianic dreamer Emanuel ben Nissan. In response to the dramatic events of the late 1920s, not least the Arab Riots in Palestine, several kabbalists hung up the following placard in the streets of Jerusalem:Blessed is God. Return Israel! to the Lord your God, etc. Remember the Torah of Moshe My servant that I commanded him on [Mount] Horeb regarding all Israel’s laws and rules. Forthwith I am sending to you Elijah the Prophet in the run-up to the great and terrifying day of God. He [i.e., Elijah] will restore the ancestors’ heart to the sons and the sons’ heart to the ancestors.In the holy city of Jerusalem in the neighborhood of Mishkenot [Yis-rael] in the Neve Shalom Synagogue of the rabbi R. Shalom Araki, on the 21st of Menacḥem Av and on the 11th of the month of mercy 5689 [1929], we have decided to determine by means of the kabbalah whether the matter of this decree and these travails, etc. are from heaven or from hu-man beings.That same day, following prayer and supplications, etc. as per the kab-balah [that were led] by the genius rabbi, the deer, Shimon Zvi son of the illustrious rabbi Meir Leib Horowitz, the rosh yeshiva of the kabbalists of the holy city of Jerusalem, rosh yeshiva of Sha’ar haShamayim in Je-rusalem, we conducted dream questions and commemorations, etc. [By dint of these measures,] we received an answer concerning the essence of this decree that it was from God. Furthermore, [we were informed] that if you [i.e., the Jewish people] now repent, God will forgive. Along with the questions and answers we received, we did another confession. The answer that I saw was that you confessed, etc.A[nswer].

A couple of months earlier, that same dreamer circulated a placard announcing that Elijah and the Patriarchs had appeared to him in his dreams on several occasions and informed him that if the Jews repent, the messiah is likely to come in the year 1929. Moreover, they revealed 79 “Return O Israel,” 1929 (placard)."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"chapter 4124<UN>that the Messiah’s name is Ezekiel. The visionary turned to R. Yaakov Meir and R. Kook, who encouraged him to disseminate a notice containing a summary of the dream and various exhortations in the spirit of the prophets.80 In sum, Horowitz’s second placard basically describes the reconstruction of the mys-tic’s apocalyptic dream.After the designated year had come and gone, Horowitz committed to vari-ous other forecasts. Moshe Skrovon’s Sefer leQeṣ haYamin (A Book for the End of the Days), which came out in Warsaw in 1933, features calculations for 1934 and onwards. The work’s cover notes that it was “Agreed to and sanctioned by the divine genius and kabbalist, head of the kabbalists in the Holy Land, the rabbi R. Shimon Zvi Lider, may he merit salutary longevity amen.”81 More-over, Horowitz’s approval of Skrovon’s booklet includes this revealing passage: “Amid the darkness of this great and terrible Exile, it is worthy and meritorious for whoever has any esoteric knowledge and good hints on the matter of the redemption to bring them to press, as this will elicit happiness in a person’s heart and strengthening and hope, which is like a [medical] shot to a frail body and like cold water on a weary soul.” Throughout Sefer leQeṣ haYamin, Skrovon refers to Horowitz’s predictions that the redemption will transpire in approximately 1933.82 The booklet’s content suggests that it constitutes but a tenth of a comprehensive, unpublished work. The full text included chapters on the Ten Tribes and a mysterious epistle containing hints of the messiah’s arrival and calculations thereof, which are attributed to the Vilna Gaon. This same letter has sparked a great deal of scholarly conjecture. Horowitz’s name 80 Emanuel ben Nissan, “Kol Mevasser, Mevasser veOmer,” 1929 (placard); repr. in Kluger, Min haMeqor, vol. 1, 109. Also see Hamberger, Meshiḥei haSheqer uMisnagdeihem, 641–642. Hamberger, who portrayed Emanuel as a sort of “false messiah,” was unaware of Horow-itz’s second placard. A wealth of material on Emanuel ben Nissan’s multifaceted visions, including outlines of his dreams, and copies of the placards and booklets that he dis-seminated throughout Jerusalem can be found in a file that was kept on this eccentric mystic by Moshe David Gaon; Emanuel ben Nissan, List of Typewritten Dreams, News-paper Clippings, Notices, and Booklets (ms).

Besides a calculation for 1936, this work states that the letter under review will be deci-phered in the near future. However, the author never got around to it.83 Else-where, Horowitz is credited with a forecast for the years 1948 and 1949, which is also tied to the Vilna Gaon (more precisely, to a late tradition of the Rivlin family).84 Horowitz repeatedly found inspiration in these sort of predictions as well as the content of visions, recondite texts, and utterances. More specifi-cally, the co-rosh yeshiva searched for clues in various materials that would buttress his activity to hasten the messiah’s coming and buoy his hopes of finding the Lost Tribes. Two Shelved Letters to the Ten TribesAs a final coda to this chapter, we will unveil two remnants of Horowitz’s extensive efforts to track down the Lost Tribes, which have reached the Schwad-ron Collection in the Israel National Library. More specifically, the book pres-ents choice excerpts from two heretofore unpublished epistles from 1933 to 1936. Spurred on by the major developments in Europe and Palestine at the time, these manuscripts were addressed to the Rechabites, the Sons of Moses, and the Lost Tribes. Similar letters were written and published in the run-up to Horowitz’s first expedition back in 1899, and their dissemination caused quite a stir in Jewish circles. As we have seen, this sort of epistle was also deposited in the hands of a Rechabite who turned up in Jerusalem in 1913.Given the unlikelihood that Sha’ar haShamayim was organizing a new del-egation or expecting an emissary from the banks of the Sambatyon, it is not known how Horowitz and his associates planned to convey these letters to their destination. In other words, the documents reflect a yearning for the Israelites that was elicited by a sense of distress and despair. That said, the 83 Demdus, Igeret haGRA (1937). For more on this bizarre episode, see Eliakh, Sefer haGaon, vol. 3, 1260–1268. According to a similar account, 1938 and 1939 were also deemed to be fateful years. This prediction found its way into Hedaya, Sefer haḤayim ṿe’haShalom, vol. 2, 75b–76a.84 Zussman, MiBeḥirei Ṣadiqaya, 168. A similar calculation was already published in 1928 by the Jerusalem kabbalist Isaac Alfiyahh, HaQuntres haYeḥiyel, vol. 1, 97b–98b. It was adapted in Chaim Shvili, Sefer Ḥazon haḤayim, 83–84. An apocalypse forecaster in his own right, Shvili added that this date was calculated by the Vilna Gaon, and “this is how it was interpreted by a few of Jerusalem’s sages.” Also see Shlomo Zalman Rivlin, Midrash Shlomo, 6."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"chapter 4126<UN>two epistles are not of the same cloth.

And as is written (Psalms song 44[:20]), “Though Thou has cast us in a place of jackals and covered us in the shad-ow of death,” our eyes are lifted to our Father on high who by virtue and by dint of the Sons of Moses our Rabbi, may his virtue protect us, the Holy One, may his name be exalted, will send us the salvation just as was written by the Hasid, God’s saint, our illustrious rabbi R. Elijah of Vilnius of blessed memory regarding the verse “For liberators shall march up on Mount Zion to wreak judgment on Mount Esau; and dominion shall be the Lord’s” (Obadiah 1:21). It is said apropos of the Sons of Moses our Rabbi, may his virtue protect us, that they are liberators. May it be [His] will that it [i.e., this prophecy] shall be fulfilled soon in our days, and May He Who said to his world Enough, say to our troubles Enough [see Rashi on Genesis 43:14]. Thereafter our eyes shall see and our hearts shall re-joice over the salvation of the divine presence on the part of our exalted Strength quickly in our days, amen.In light of the above, we ask for mercy from our dear brothers the gen-erous sons of Jonadab ben Rechab to respect the Lord our God and have pity on our wretched brothers [among] the Jewish people.

In 1921, they began to perpetuate pogroms against the Jewish community, and a couple of times they accosted the Jewish people and spilled Jewish blood as though it were water. In the year 1929, they ratcheted up their evil to a very large degree and took in Jerusalem and its environs thirty saintly lives, in Hebron, the city of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob’s tombs they took sixty-six saintly lives in cruel executions and harsh and severe forms of torture. Furthermore, they burnt a few Torah scrolls, and all the houses of worship and Torah were destroyed by them. In the rest of the cities of Israel, they took thirty-six lives, plundered their property, and destroyed their homes. All told, one hundred and thirty-two holy lives were taken by the Arabs, may their names be effaced. All this was done under the counsel and at the behest of their chieftain [i.e., Grand Mufti Haj Amin 90 In an earlier letter, Horowitz also claimed that he has access to a “ship that floats in the air.” Both references come up in similar contexts; see Waldman, From Ethiopia to Jerusa-lem, 130–131.91 At this point in Horowitz’s epistle, there is a complex and rambling Halakhic argument as to why it is incumbent on the Rechabites to come to the aid of the Jewish people."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"131The Search For The Lost Tribes<UN>al-Husseini] in Jerusalem.

Additionally, we do not know if a messenger was entrusted with this mission. In any event, the lack of either a military objective in this communication or a desire to actually find the Lost Tribes speaks volumes. In this hour of need, Horowitz suffices with a heartfelt request that the Tribes dispatch an emissary to Jerusalem for the sake of revealing secrets to Knesset Yisrael. The age-old myth of the Ten Tribes ral-lying to the defense of their co-religionists takes the form of a vision in which a savior reveals esoteric knowledge.In sum, the Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva and its leadership ranks created and buttressed a modern narrative that revolves around hastening the settlement of the Land of Israel, the ingathering of the exiles, and the redemption.

Back in 1904, the Rehovot haNahar Yeshiva circulated a notice in this very spirit. The authors clamored for “an awakening to excite the heart of our brothers the Jewish people as to the cause of the Exile” and urged them to study kabbalah on a daily basis.1 In fact, it seems as though every kabbalah book that was printed in the early twentieth century, even outside the borders of Palestine, contained such statements. Histrionics are blended with ideology to the point where it is difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff. In the final analysis, this exhorta-tion was directed primarily at Torah scholars.The kabbalah seminaries in Jerusalem put out a wide assortment of books that were written by its resident scholars and past sages from Beit El on, above all, the creed of HaARI and the RaShaSh. The targeted audience was the ye-shivot’s habitués, who occasionally received the publications free of charge. Moreover, each of the institutions printed out small booklets containing prayers and rituals. At times, they were texts of one-time prayers that had been held on special occasions. They also distributed calendars with advertisements for the seminaries and fundraising appeals. If this was the extent of these activities, there would be nothing extraordinary about them. However, several major shifts or revolutions in the kabbalah circles’ printing output transpired during these years: (a) The printing of the RaShaSh’s siddur and parts of the Lurian corpus was a shared enterprise carried out by both Ashkenazic and Sep-hardic sages alike from all the yeshivot as well as unaffiliated kabbalists. (b) A concerted effort was made to print from the tikkunim literature and motivate the Orthodox public to perform various kabbalistic rituals. In general, these exhortations were put forth by the seminaries under review and ultimately bolstered their standing as institutions of public import. Parts of this corpus were also tied to Lurianic and Sharabian thought. (c) Attempts to convince Torah scholars to embrace the wisdom of kabbalah, especially HaARI’s approach. (d) Innovative interpretations of Lurianic thought by individual 1 This statement also appeared at the end of Mishan, Sefer Sfat Emet which was intended for Rehovot haNahar’s sages.

Before elaborating on each of these clauses, let us first take stock of the printing vision of the key figure in this enterprise. The Printing Vision of Sha’ar haShamayimFinding the Ten Tribes remained a declared objective of the Sha’ar haShamay-im leadership, even after its sundry failures in this area. Conversely, the yeshi-va was rather successful in all that concerned the dissemination of kabbalah, both in Jerusalem and beyond. Given its exoteric perspectives, the institu-tion was eager to take advantage of the printing press. In this respect, Sha’ar haShamayim modelled itself on the rest of the city’s kabbalah seminaries, but added a new wrinkle of its own. Horowitz crafted a grand vision for publishing the works of HaARI and the RaShaSh according to which the savants’ output would be divided into various entries. This kabbalah encyclopedia or primer would take up several volumes. Moreover, the project would include commen-taries and comparable works by other sages. The defining elements of this plan were a “simple interpretation” of the homiletic corpus and an anthology of commentaries on the kabbalah literature, with “notes by the yeshiva’s rabbis.”2Years later, Horowitz apparently wrote an introduction to Jewish mysti-cal knowledge, which he titled Sefer Yesodei haKabbalah (The Principles of Kabbalah). However, the primer never came out and its whereabouts are unknown.3 According to one source, he authored a book on the kabbalistic spheres, Ilana d’Hayay (The Tree of Life), which may very well be that same closeted manuscript.4 Moreover, he compiled annotations for the RaShaSh’s siddur that have also remained in manuscript form.52 Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva, Ḥotam Tokhnit (1912), 5–6. Horowitz mapped out his vision as far back as 1899, in his introduction to Joseph of Lesko, Sefer Ateret Yosef.3 The book is mentioned in Horowitz’s approval for Rabinowitz, Mevasser veOmer Neḥamat Menaḥem. In the mid-1920s, Levi Isaac Krakovsky, a disciple of Yehuda Leib Ashlag, similarly endeavored to publish a sort of concordance of the kabbalah wisdom, with definitions and explanations. Krakovsky’s plans are evidenced by Ashlag’s closeted letter of approval from 1936 (ms). See Myers, Kabbalah and the Spiritual Quest, 22–31, 34–37; Meir, “The Beginnings of Kabbalah in America,” 237–268.4 Tidhar, Encyclopedia of the Pioneers, vol. 1, 334. Moreover, Tidhar noted that many of Horow-itz’s notes and explanations on kabbalah books, as well as letters to researchers on the matter of the Ten Tribes, remain in the co-rosh yeshiva’s literary estate, the whereabouts of which are unknown.5 See, for example, Dablitski’s use of these annotations; idem, Petaḥ ’Einayim haḤadash, vol. 5, Introduction."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"137Concealment and Revelation<UN>Horowitz conceived of several other major projects in the field of publish-ing. To begin with, he planned to establish a highbrow journal on Halakhic and kabbalistic issues by the name of Pardes.6 Furthermore, he launched a venture aimed at printing hundreds of kabbala manuscripts that had reached the yeshiva’s library. In fact, Sha’ar haShamayim aspired to collect every work of kabbalah ever written, thereby amassing the largest collection of Jewish mysti-cal literature in the world. At one and the same time, Gershom Scholem began to articulate a similar project, which ultimately came to fruition within the framework of the Hebrew University.7 Owing to budgetary constraints, Sha’ar haShamayim’s sages were forced to give up on many of these ideas. That said, they managed to complete a few large enterprises and collaborated on mul-tiple printing projects with other seminaries, foremost among them Rehovot haNahar. Three Kabbalah PrimersOf particular interest are several booklets that endeavored to prod Jews into studying Jewish esoteric knowledge. Circulated by the seminaries under review, these works also offered introductions for those entering the gates of Jewish mysticism. Put differently, these texts not only motivated people to embrace kabbalah, but sought to prepare them for this undertaking, warn them about the hazards involved, and lay down the necessary ground rules and borders. Most of these pamphlets were released by Sha’ar haShamayim. In these works, the dynamics between revelation and concealment assumes center stage; this within the context of preparing the individual for incremental study, rather than struggles for power, authority, or ownership over the kabbalah. As noted, Horowitz was planning to release a book that focuses on the essentials of the kabbalah literature. Conversely, the objective behind the booklets in question was twofold: on the one hand, they were meant to be studied and memorized by novices with the requisite tools for immersing themselves in Kabbalah; and 6 Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva, Ḥotam Tokhnit (1912), 5.7 Ibid, 6. Sha’ar haShamayim’s “library project” was but a partial success. Likewise, financial woes prevented the institution from printing the manuscripts that it had acquired; see Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva, Ḥotam Tokhnit (1925), 10–11. A couple of the yeshivot in Jerusalem had substantial collections. For instance, Beit El was known for its extensive kabbalah holdings. See Ben-Nae, “The Yeshivot in Jerusalem,” 337–339; Gaon, Oriental Jews, vol. 2, 287–288; Bena-yahu, “Osafei Sefarim,” 243–247, 313–321; Schidorsky, “Cultural Agents,” 377–380.

Like many of the kabbalah works that were put out in Jerusalem during this period, the pamphlets were faithful to the exegetical tradition of HaARI and the RaShaSh.In 1911, Sha’ar haShamayim printed the first work of this kind – Quntres Shuvi Shuvi haShulamit by R. Yosef Hayyim of Baghdad (HaBen Ish Ḥai) – which Horowitz defined as a primer for Jewish mysticism. This work includes three introductions that were copied from Sefer Da’at uTvunah, a well-received kabbalah primer that Ben-Zion Mordechai Hazan printed that same year.8 Shuvi haShulamit opens with a warning to beginners not to enter the Kab-balah before reading the “introductions seven times.” Having completed this step, the reader “will begin to study the words of our rabbi HaARI in the chap-ters that we copied in this book, which are organized before you in the right order.”9 Yosef Hayyim, who is discussed at length below, considered this work a replacement for Yosef Irgas’ Sefer Shomer Emunim, a summary of and intro-duction to the kabbalah. The author instructed novices to go over its content 15 times; and “after filling his stomach with them,” the student will be ready for Sefer Eṣ Ḥayyim. These steps should be taken “regardless of whether he [i.e., the beginner] is knowingly smart and wise, regardless of whether he studies by his rabbi’s side, regardless of whether he studies with friends.”10 As Yosef Hayyim explained, his intention was not to dampen the spirits of those taking up the concealed Torah, but to adequately prepare them for this odyssey. The intro-duction concludes with a warning that aptly reflects the dynamics between the obligation of studying the kabbalah, which was imposed on each and every male Jew, and the necessary preparations for this arduous task:The reader should not think that I wrote these things in my introduc-tion in order to cause apathy among those dealing with this wisdom, God forbid. This is not my intention. Instead, all I mean to do is standardize the study of this wisdom for the educated who will learn this wisdom out of fear and trepidation and trembling and quaking. And he who learns should not be unripe concerning this wisdom. Moreover, he should not be smart in his own eyes to say I have studied all the books of HaARI, 8 Yosef Hayyim, Quntres Shuvi Shuvi haShulamit Not all the copies of this pamphlet identi-fied Sha’ar haShamayim as the publisher. For this reason, it stands to reason that they were concomitantly printed for multiple audiences; see Ben-Yaakov, Rabbi Yosef Hayyim, 79–80. The work also heaps praise on HaARI and the RaShaSh.9 Yosef Hayyim, Sefer Da’at uTvunah.

Furthermore, do not rely on the most recent authors of the marginalia [i.e., commentators] who cite the words of our rabbis and note to see here and see there; in this manner, they intend to solve the difficulties that lay on the main road, which the student is bound to have trouble with. It is possible that they are mistaken and that they draw a conclusion from the unknown to the known, even though it appears that the name of the place and the name of the face are the same. As a rule, one who thinks that he knows – does not know; and one who thinks that he does not know – can be said to know. [...] As King David, may peace be upon him, said, Open my eyes, that I may behold the wonders of your teaching.11These basic requirements for entering the realm of the Kabbalah are under-girded by the imperative to strike a balance between revelation and conceal-ment – a goal that was shared by all of Jerusalem’s kabbalists during this period.Shortly after Quntres Shuvi Shuvi haShulamit came out, Sha’ar haShamayim printed an abbreviated version of Haim Vital’s introduction to Sha’ar haHak-damot, along with plaudits for those learning kabbalah.12 Moreover, Aharon Shlomo Maharil, among the yeshiva’s sages, put out a new edition of Meir ben Judah Leib Poppers’ Sefer Mesilot Ḥokhma. As stated on the cover, it was printed “by the hands of the awakening and at the request of the administra-tors of the holy yeshiva Sha’ar haShamayim in the holy city of Jerusalem.” A lengthy foreword by Maharil expounds on the importance of studying kabbal-ah in these times, before ending on the following note: “And even with respect to those who lack the strength to come and enter [in order] to permanently reside inside, he must study from this small book the minimum amount for fulfilling his obligation of this study, until the Holy One shall help him and he will want to permanently occupy himself in the writings of HaARI, or the rest of the kabbalists’ books.”13These publications, especially the dynamics between revelation and con-cealment, duly reflect the spirit of the kabbalah seminaries in early twentieth-century Jerusalem. More specifically, while readers were called upon to take up Jewish mysticism, the authors reiterated the need for incremental progress. For the purpose of assaying the unique qualities of these institutions, it is in-cumbent upon us to examine two large ventures that involved Sephardic and 11 Ibid.12 Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva, Haqdamat Rabbi Haim Vital.13 Maharil, Sefer Mesilot Ḥokhma, 8b."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"chapter 5140<UN>Ashkenazic kabbalists from all the yeshivot: the first print version of the Ra-ShaSh’s siddur; and the new release of most of the kabbalistic works that are attributed to HaARI. These undertakings divulge the objectives behind these institutions’ efforts to spread Kabbalistic literature. The Mekhavvnim and the Dissemination of the RaShaSh’s SiddurThe printing of the RaShaSh’s siddur, which was hitherto confined to manu-scripts and a small cadre of kabbalists, was a quasi-revolution. Over the generations, dozens of manuscript copies of this book were produced by intenter-kabbalists. Not only was this the first time that this prayer book was brought to print, but the kabbalah circles hitherto felt no need to do so, for it was exclusively intended for a small handful of experts in the art of praying with intentions. The various manuscripts contained a bevy of different inten-tions, all of which derived from one source – Shalom Sharabi. Every time a manuscript was rendered, the copyist added annotations, new versions, and corrections.14 At the turn of the twentieth century, though, kabbalists began to print extensively from the siddur. The initiators cited numerous reasons for embarking on this task, many of which are intriguing. At any rate, this project divulged the closely-held text and basically established a uniform, standard-ized version of the book, which ostensibly supplanted the plethora of manu-script editions. This was indeed the first attempt to canonize the RaShaSh’s siddur, which had undergone many changes over the years due to the scores of handwritten copies.The first to systematically print various parts of this book were Sha’ar ha-Shamayim’s kabbalists. They drew primarily on its “short version,” which was held by the sages from Allepo, rather than “the long version,” which was in the hands of the Beit El Yeshiva. From 1911 onward, the siddur was printed in nine installments by Reuven Haas with the help of Sha’ar haShamayim’s 14 The Israel National Library’s Institute of Microfilmed Hebrew Manuscripts possesses nearly two hundred copies of multifarious parts of the RaShaSh’s siddur, most of which are from nineteenth and twentieth-century manuscripts. Some of them merited micro-filmed versions in the latter half of the 1900s. For a description of these rudimentary manuscripts, see Hillel, Ahavat Shalom, 202–238. The Moussaieff Collection abounds with manuscripts that pertain to the Sharabian kabbalah, including many copies of the long and short versions of the RaShaSh’s siddur and explanations thereof; see Avivi, Ohel Shem, 167–190."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"141Concealment and Revelation<UN>regulars. The project was completed and printed anew within approximately five years.15Gracing the first volume were approvals by Ḥaim Berlin, Tzvi Hirsch Shapira of Munkacs, and Menahem Menkhin Halperin, among others. They effusively commended Reuven Hass and Sha’ar haShamayim’s kabbalists for toiling to bring the siddur to press. According to the publisher’s foreword, this initiative was undertaken due to the inability to meet the swelling demand for this book via handwritten copies. It also notes that the book was printed “in holiness, in ritual immersion, and in purity.” This explanation befits the habitués of this particular institution, for they did not have manuscripts of the siddur at their disposal. “In Jerusalem,” the newspaper HaBazeleth reported, “the concealed light, a manuscript that was stored and hidden away for roughly 150 years, was published.” Readers were also informed of the address at which the book could be purchased, namely the home of Reuven Haas.16 Following the siddur’s release, Sha’ar haShamayim circulated notices on kabbalah matters, one of which included “a pre-prayer prayer” authored by the RaShaSh.17On the face of things, it would appear that the sole executor of this project was Sha’ar haShamayim. This is the impression not only from siddur’s approv-als, but the title page of the first volume:The siddur by our teacher and rabbi, the holy rabbi Shalom Sharabi, who imbibed the milk and honey from the sacred works of the master rabbi of the Jewish people our teacher the rabbi Hayyim Vital, who is faithful to 15 Sharabi, Siddur Tefila, vols. 1–2 (1911–1912); vol. 3 (1916).

Some of them were brought to press by Mordechai Attiya, within the framework of Yeshivat haHaim ve’haShalom ( Jerusalem, 1974). Elegant editions of the first two volumes, which were found in Moussaieff ’s library, were put out by Bar-Ilan University’s Moussaieff Center for Kabbalah Research (Tel Aviv, 2006). Dablitski discusses how the siddur’s approval was copied to another version; idem, “Hashmatot,” 77. A wondrous tale about the peregrinations of a manuscript copy of the siddur across wide swathes of Europe before it was finally published is related by Getz, Beyn Yerushalayim vehaGola, 108–207. This story intermingles a smattering of truth with a great deal of imagination. Also see Mondshein, “Gilgulo shel Siddur.” A major impetus behind the fabrication of these later myths was to excuse the Hasidic grand rabbis’ un-familiarity with the Sharabian way and to exude a semblance of uniformity between the liturgies of the various kabbalah streams. Among the authors of these same tales was ryaz Margaliot; for example, he is cited on this topic in Moskowitz, Oṣar haSipurim, vol, 4, 3–4.16 Haas, “Or Ḥadash.”17 Haas, “MeSiddur Tefila;” idem, “Maṣati Katuv baMenora.” As we shall see, Haas also played a role in the publication of HaARI’s works."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"chapter 5142<UN>the holy edifice of our divine holy rabbi, the one-of-a-kind phenomenon HaARI. He [i.e., the RaShaSh] arranged for us a siddur with true inten-tions for the entire order of prayers for the entire year. In their written form, they constitute a very great and terrifying work. In the mean-time, this part was released by the awakening of the sages of the Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva, which was established for learning the wisdom of truth. May it be God’s will that just as we merited these rays of light, so may we merit the entire great light.18It also bears noting that the publishers solicited rabbis in East Europe who did not adopt the RaShaSh’s way. This suggests that Rehovot haNahar was uninvolved in the task at hand. On the other hand, the decision to print the short version bears the hallmark of the Allepo tradition, which had many followers in that yeshiva. As discussed earlier, Sha’ar haShamayim’s kabbalists apparently learnt the art of the intentions from Dweck-HaKohen. Consequent-ly, it stands to reason that they adopted the siddur that he preferred – the short version.Notwithstanding the lack of acknowledgment in the siddur’s approv-als, introduction, or cover, there is reason to believe that Rehovot haNahar’s kabbalists played a significant role in preparing the book for print. First, Dweck-HaKohen anonymously contributed short annotations to the opening pages of the first volume, under the title “Ḥesed veEmet.”19 Second, the com-positor (or one of the compositors) was apparently Eliyahu Yaakov Lag’imi of Morocco (1871–1927), who was a habitué of Beit El and Rehovot haNahar as well as a confidante of Dweck-HaKohen.20 In addition, the second volume includes corrections and remarks by Yom Tov Yedid Halevi of Allepo (ob. 1923), who was also one of the important scholars and a founder of Rehovot haNahar. His explanations are longer than Dweck-HaKohen’s in the first volume, and they occasionally refer to the wording of the “long siddur.”2118 Sharabi, Siddur Tefila, vol. 1 (1911), 1a.19 Ibid, 2a–8a.20 Lag'imi’s name comes up several times in the book’s marginalia; ibid, 76b: “And I pro-posed these ideas before the friends, the mekhavvnim in the holy community of Beit El in the society of Rehovot [i.e., the Rehovot haNahar Yeshiva], in whose company I learn and who I feel an affinity for. And without mincing words, they said that this is indeed the case.” Some of his comments employ abbreviations: “the compositor E[liyahu] Y[aakov] L[eg'imi] H[aCohen];” ibid, 78a, 94b, 105b. For more on Lag'imi, see Gaon, Oriental Jews, vol. 2, 82; Yehoshua, “Fortune Tellers,” 225–226; Hallamish, Kabbalah in North Africa, 27; Munseh, Pada et Avraham, vol. 1, 418, 417.21 See, for example, the comments that Halevi made under his full signature; Sharabi, Siddur Tefila, vol. 2, 13a, 17b. Thereafter, he uses many more abbreviations, like “the compositor"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"143Concealment and Revelation<UN>Nevertheless, Dweck-HaKohen, Lag’imi, and Halevi’s names are completely absent from the introductions and approvals to the first two volumes. Only a more comprehensive version of the siddur, which was printed in 1917, ex-pressly mentions two of Rehovot haNahar’s sages, Yom Tov Yedid Halevi and his son Eliezer (in their capacity as the authors of various annotations and as the print producers), alongside Shmuel Kirshenbaum, Yaakov Meir Zonnen-feld, and Reuven Haas (as print producers). While the new siddur included the old approvals, their dates were erased. Moreover, it acknowledges the con-tributions of both Sha’ar haShamayim and Rehovot haNahar’s rabbis. Accord-ing to one source, Nissim Nahum provided the financial backing for its print-ing.22 In summation, even if it is not explicitly stated in the first volume and the initiative behind this venture came from Sha’ar haShamayim’s kabbalists, who entreated the yeshivot possessing the manuscripts to duplicate them, the print version of the RaShaSh’s siddur constituted a full-fledged collaboration between Ashkenazic and Sephardic sages.23All told, this particular edition constituted but a modest portion of the kavvanot corpus, and resources were allocated to printing the other books as well. For instance, Rehovot haNahar simultaneously put out another part of the RaShaSh’s siddur (on the bedtime Kriyat Sh’ma), with Nissim Nahum’s support. The foreword contains a predicatable reason for its publication:We have duly seen the magnitude of the longing of God-fearing sages, who are already used to concentrating on matters of utmost importance. Moreover, their soul yearns and pines to have a completed siddur of the bedtime Kriyat Sh’ma that was formulated by the RaShaSh, from the words of HaARI, and they have not managed to write a siddur in man-uscript [form]. In addition, the siddurs of the Kriyat Sh’ma are scarce, namely they are in the hands of a few yod’ei ḥen [kabbalah insiders], and this too is a pittance out of a pittance, which are largely mislead-ing due to the copying of copyists as is known by yod’ei ḥen.

Therefore, Sha’ar haShamayim insis-tently pleaded with the older institution to bring the siddur to press.Spurred on by the Ashkenazim’s requests and the general objective of spreading kabbalah learning and the prayer intentions, the same version of the siddur on Kriyat Sh’ma was reprinted, albeit with corrections and a new introduction by Sha’ar haShamayim’s kabbalists.25 This edition also included a discussion on the schedule at the said yeshiva and its “revelation of HaARI’s gospel.” That said, the publishers made note of the fact that they did not oper-ate alone. “Credit” was given to those “in the holy fellowship, the sages and rab-bis, the great kabbalists who have prayed with intention using the holy siddur of our rabbi, the master RaShaSh for quite some time in the Society of Rehovot, which endeavored with us to release it to the light of the world.” Moreover, they acknowledged Nissim Nahum’s contribution to this enterprise. In brief, this project also stemmed from a collaboration with Rehovot haNahar’s sages, who had printed this section of the RaShaSh’s prayer book a short while earlier. This edition opens by warning readers that not “everyone should seek out the holiness of praying with intention with this holy siddur. Only those who have already immersed themselves in the writing of HaARI and the sacred book Nahar Shalom.” These prerequisites betray an attempt to maintain certain bor-ders even after the siddur’s release. Be that as it may, the introduction declares that the boundaries have been upended by this very act of revelation:And this is, with the Lord’s assistance, an explanation of the hope for redemption and pity thanks to the sacred fellowship of the holy HaARI and his student R. Hayyim Vital, and every one of the sacred band of holy prophets and the divine tanna RaShBY [R. Simeon bar Yochai] who left us from their good treasury a treasure of the holy attributes that were heretofore stored away and placed in the corner.

There is no date of publication. As per Kassin’s testimony, the book has been dated to roughly 1898; Kassin, Sefer Pri Eṣ haGan, 81. However, it is more logical that it was printed around 1914. The introduction brings up the revival of kabbalah study at Sha’ar haShamayim.25 Siddur Ḥayim ṿeShalom (1914)."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"145Concealment and Revelation<UN>path of the concealed Torah, to learn the secret discourse of the holy ser-aphs. And we hand out kabbalah books to yeshiva students free of charge, and many have set aside time for this study in their homes. And this holy yeshiva, Sha’ar haShamayim, and the branch Kahal Ḥasidim released kabbalah study from the prison cell and will disseminate this wisdom like a shining light.26Sha’ar haShamayim printed yet another portion of the RaShaSh’s siddur that same year. Here too, they discussed the essence of the revelatory act: “Until now [the siddur] was only [available as] a handwritten copy by two or three exceptionally holy people; and we have latterly been fortunate enough to print it from our holy yeshiva Sha’ar haShamayim. It is as though the heavens have opened, and all those seeking God’s words will come and see the feats of the Lord and the torches of fire that are blazing in each and every letter.”27 Besides the adulation for the yeshiva and its schedule, the publishers reiterated that “It is a good sign for the Jewish people that the sources of light are drawing closer to us in our generation, one step after the other, and the longing to study the wisdom of the truth intensifies.” All these developments are “harbingers of the redemption.”28 Kavvanot for the Select Few and Criticism of the Siddur’s printingIn all likelihood, hundreds of the printed siddurs were distributed in the Land of Israel and abroad (this estimate is deduced from, among other things, Sha’ar haShamayim’s general ledgers, which account for the shipments to East Europe). Regardless of the exact number, more than a few observers were up in arms over this enterprise. This criticism reverberates in the following words of Moshe David Gaon from 1938: “Beit El’s Hasids, all of whom are Sephardim, have special prayer arrangements that Ashkenazic kabbalists printed in the year 1916, but the mekhavvnim pray specifically out of handwritten siddurs, as the forerunners decreed that it is forbidden to pray with intentions from a printed book.”29 Notwithstanding several inaccuracies, it is clear from Gaon’s 26 Ibid, “Introduction.”27 Siddur Kavanot Sefirat haOmer (1914).28 Ibid.29 Gaon, Oriental Jews, vol. 1, 141. Gaon reiterated and expanded on this point elsewhere in his book: “As per a known tradition, the Sephardic sages in the holy city do not customar-ily pray with intentions out of a printed prayer book, but solely out of a manuscript; and"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"chapter 5146<UN>words that there were Sephardic rabbis who objected to this undertaking. Some viewed the attempt to canonize the manuscripts via a print edition to be such a huge failure that these editions were unsuitable for praying with intentions. Gaon was obviously referring to discrepancies between the printed siddur and the long version, which Beit El’s sages used for their prayer services. According to one tradition, the venerable yeshiva refused to hand over its manuscripts of the RaShaSh’s siddur to the publishers “for a couple of undisclosed reasons.” Therefore, the printed siddur is largely based on the short version that was in Rehovot haNahar’s possession.30Other sources claim that Dweck-HaKohen had reservations about the mass distribution of this prayer book. He opined that it should be printed on a one-time basis for a limited audience. A couple of witnesses stated that the rosh yeshiva was afraid that the siddur would reach the hands of “strangers” (i.e., secular Jews) and “would bounce around and end up in the universities and the homes of Drs. [sic] and professors.”31 In fact, a few manuscripts of the siddur indeed found their way to academic researchers during this period.32 Another cause for concern was that the books would fall into the hands of those erroneously claiming to have the requisite knowledge for praying with intentions, thereby causing serious harm. In 1935, local newspapers reported that the printing of the siddur “roused up noise in various circles, which saw” the circulation of “the sacred names [of God] that are written in holiness and purity in regular print” to be a desecration. What is more, they feared that in so doing, “mysteries of the Torah would reach people that are not yet worthy of praying in this fashion”.33this custom is maintained by them to this day [1938]” (ibid, 684). Also see Gepner, Mi-drasho shel Shem, 53: “And from the outset, they would see to it to pray from a manuscript and nothing else.” The Beit El circle also passed on a tradition according to which the RaShaSh recited the intentions by heart and merely compiled the siddur as a memento. There is a possibility that this story was only introduced in the early twentieth century, amid the objections to the siddur’s printing; Afg’in, Divrei Shalom, vol. 2, 123.30 Alfiyahh, Reiyaḥ leYiṣḥaq, 166b. See Hillel, Ahavat Shalom, 266, 269–270; Margaliot, Ṣevi laṢadiq, 25–26.31 Moskowitz, Ḥayei haRashash, 36; Hillel, Ahavat Shalom, 229; idem, “The Life of Dweck-HaKohen,” 42–46. Also see Shmueli, VeZaraḥ haShemesh, 82; Meshi Zahav, Yerushayim, 90–95.32 For example, a manuscript of the siddur reached the Israel National Library from the estate of R. Aharon Bachar Isaac Perera in 1921. It was described nine years later by Gershom Scholem, Catalogus codicum cabbalisticorum, 167–169. Likewise, Shmuel Yosef Agnon, who was close to a few of Beit El’s kabbalists, held a part of the RaShaSh’s siddur, which was copied in Jerusalem circa 1920.33 Laniado, “The Elder of the Kabbalists,” 3."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"147Concealment and Revelation<UN>The objections to the dissemination of HaARI and the RaShaSh’s intentions, which had begun to be heard years before the printing, were now voiced with all the more vigor. Be that as it may, the naysayers themselves undertook to spread the kabbalah to gifted individuals. In all likelihood, this criticism was tied to the view that the RaShaSh’s writings were esoteric. This outlook gained momentum in the immediate aftermath of the esteemed kabbalist’s passing. A case in point is a response by Hezekiahu Isaac Mizrahi Sharabi, the RaShaSh’s son, to a question concerning his father’s thought in 1790:And his words are ambiguous and sealed without being understood, even though one or two that served before him and drank of his water, and they knew the way in which he tread his feet. Nevertheless, my rabbi, father, was wont to say throughout his lifetime that all his paths that were put in writing are nothing but hints and chapter headings. In general, he reveals a handbreadth and shrouds hundreds of thousands of hand-breadths.... What is more, even though we all pray with kavvanot [inten-tions], each of us according to his measure, we do not know the meaning of the kavvanot, what it is and what is the interpretation of what the rabbi [i.e., the RaShaSh] wrote on the matter of the prayers, the kriyat sh’ma, the blessings, and the yiḥudim, be it on the weekday, the Sabbaths, the festivals, or the high holidays, where he wrote to pray with kavvanot like this and this. What is the meaning of praying with kavvanot? and what is kavvana [intention]?34Later on, some of the printing enterprise’s detractors assumed a critical tone towards reputed outsiders. Consequently, attempts were made to limit the in-tentions to a handful of exceptional kabbalists. In 1865, Eliyahu Suliman Mani (ob. 1899) defended these restrictions: “You should know my friend that I have seen only a few mekhavvnim. Not everyone that wants to take up the Name should do so. Only those that have been graced by God, That said, not every mind can carry the burden of praying with the appropriate intentions. In this generation, I am doubtful if there is anyone capable of praying with the es-tablished intentions” in an “appropriate and fitting” manner. Alluding to the RaShaSh’s intentions that were circulated in manuscript form (some of which were in his possession), Mani wrote that “the observer will see how profound the intentions in the holy book Pri Eṣ Hayyim are,” and ever more manuscript copies of this book are currently available. “Nevertheless, who is the one that 34 Cited in Gepner, Midrasho shel Shem, 70. A different version of this excerpt can be found in Sharabi, Sefer Divrei Shalom, 14b."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"chapter 5148<UN>will sacrifice himself to this great fire? Even if there are a few sages [who] in their own eyes [have the necessary background] and pray with the intentions from the manuscript and print version, we have no desire to talk about them here.”35 Yosef Hayyim, Kabbalistic Customs and the RaShaSh’s IntentionsR. Yosef Hayyim (the Ben Ish Ḥai), the “leader of the Kabbalists of Baghdad,” copied Mani’s resolute words in a book that he anonymously printed in 1870. The work consists of several excerpts and intentions from the RaShaSh’s siddur along with descriptions of several kabbalistic rituals. Moreover, the Baghdad native distinguished between the art of intentions, which is designated for a select few, and the tikkunim literature, which was adapted for a wider audi-ence. He also disseminated numerous pamphlets featuring tikkunim.36 In one of his kabbalistic responsa, which came out in Jerusalem circa 1903 (well before Sha’ar haShamayim printed the RaShaSh’s siddur), Yosef Hayyim once again limited the intentions to a select few. More specifically, a scholar turned to him for advice as to whether the suppliant is worthy of praying with Luri-anic intentions, to which the rabbi answered:Between my eyelashes, it is evident from your letter that you have de-cided and have an urge to pray using the siddur of intentions by our rabbi HaARI or the siddur of the RaShaSh, the details of which have proliferated. Moreover, it appears that in your mind since you pray with the siddur of intentions of our rabbi HaARI and of our rabbi the RaShaSh, your prayer becomes like the prayer of [these figures]. If you shall say, what is the difference between myself and them given the fact that ev-erything is arranged before me and I see all the names and monikers [of God] that are written in the book before my very eyes. To be hon-est, someone who thinks like this is completely mistaken, for it is indeed known that our rabbi HaARI, may he be remembered in the afterlife, did 35 Mani, Sefer Kise Eliyahu, 81b. The book came out anonymously in Jerusalem circa 1865. After spending a couple of years in Beit El, Mani established a yeshiva along these same lines in Hebron, where he instituted kabbalistic customs and prayer services that revolved around the RaShaSh’s intentions; idem, Quntres Minhagei Q’Q Beit Ya’aqov. Extant manu-scripts, which were penned by Mani, offer many explanations and innovations regarding the long version of Sharabi’s prayer book; idem, Sefer Me’il Eliyahu.36 Yosef Hayyim, Seder haYom, 43b–44a."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"149Concealment and Revelation<UN>not, [and] justifiably so, reveal a handbreadth of the intentions that one must concentrate on in the prayer blessings, but revealed and covered four handbreadths, as there are specifications and details to this. Having seen the specifications that our rabbi the RaShaSh detailed in his siddur, and there are also ten corroborations for specifications regarding what is written in the siddur of the RaShaSh and an expansive explanation on the intentions that must be used. Moreover, these are oral ones that were not interpreted in the book of intentions. Our rabbi HaARI only revealed what the people of his generation and those that come [sic] after them could bear, for he saw that the hearts have diminished and there is no heart wide enough to bear and contain all the things that must be con-centrated on and pondered. Therefore, be brief on matters of the inten-tions as much as possible.37Yosef Hayyim thus praised kabbalists who cut back on Lurianic intentions, for he believed that fully comprehending this liturgy was beyond the intellectu-al means of the vast majority of sages. If this were not enough, he castigated those who delve into the RaShaSh’s siddur without sufficient preparation:In my eyes, insincere is the way of those same people who make a mock-ery of the kabbalah wisdom and set out to grab the siddur of our rabbi the RaShaSh and concentrate with it by keeping their eyes on the siddur. Of course, this prayer shawl of the intentions is pleasant, for it gives the impression that the esoteric Torah is their livelihood, that they have no dealings with profane matters, and toil in the study of this wisdom in an assiduous fashion and do not merely recite [the words]. Every person must examine himself, recognize his worth, and put himself to the test of long intentions, where an entire page can be found for every word. If he is capable of arranging a quarter of the page or a half with his eyes shut [then he may be suited for this sort of praying]. If he sees that he is not even capable of completing two lines by heart [and] needs to see [the words] laid out before his eyes in the book he is holding, how will he prod himself and wear this prayer shawl which is unbecoming of him.38In addition, the Ben Ish Ḥai emphasized the importance of finding a rabbi and/or guide who is willing to personally teach the suppliant the art of the in-tentions. He then concluded by citing similar warnings from a letter that Mani 37 Yosef Hayyim, Rav Pe’alim, vol. 3, “Sod Yesharim,” §13, 12a.38 Ibid, 11b."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"chapter 5150<UN>sent him in 1859. Eleven years later, Yosef Hayyim anonymously circulated another pamphlet, Sefer Tiqun Tefila, that was above all a collection of inten-tions (some of which were drawn from a manuscript version of the RaShaSh’s words) targeting the Jewish masses. According to its cover, the text consists of the following:True tikkunim, versions, formulas, and customs of utmost importance that have been gathered and collected from Sefer haKavvanot of our illustrious rabbi HaARI, which he received from the prophet Eliyahu, and all the more so from the siddur of our rabbi the RaShaSh, whose every word is grounded exclusively on the true kabbalah of our rabbi HaARI.39That said, the Baghdad leader did not limit his public outreach to vigils. From the pamphlet’s introduction, it is evident that he also sought to run a major campaign aimed at disseminating intentions to the general public:May Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad [Psalms 14:7] upon the revelation of revelations of the true kabbalah’s precious light that the saint, the foundation of the world, our teacher and rabbi HaARI received from [the prophet] Eliyahu. It is also worth noting that not every mind can bear this and not every person is fortunate enough to plumb its depths and un-derstand its mysteries. However, may it be our consolation upon tasting a morsel, according to our value, of its sweats and its honey in the good and precious customs that exist therein.... For this reason, to benefit the masses, I made a sacrificial blessing and have called it Tiqun Tefila, and it is gleaned and collected from Sefer haKavvanot by our rabbi HaARI, and from the siddur of our rabbi the RaShaSh.... Therefore, the advice that is given to every Jewish man is that he should write on his prayer book all the practices and tikkunim that are found here in order that they will serve him as a constant reminder.40The pamphlet also included the text of a Sharabian tikkun ḥaṣot (Midnight Vigil) and confession. As per Yosef Hayyim’s outlook, kabbalistic practices had indeed become mainstays of Jewish religious life and were perceived as obliga-tory customs for all Jews (see the discussion on the tikkunim literature in the next chapter). Towards the end of Sefer Tiqun Tefila, in a discussion on VaYehi 39 Yosef Hayyim, Sefer Tiqun Tefila. See the announcement of this treatise’s publication in ha-Dover (Tishrei 11, 1871); Hillel, Ben Ish Hai, 403–405, 542.40 Ibid, “Introduction.”"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"151Concealment and Revelation<UN>No’am, a prayer recited on Saturday nights, we get an inkling of his fervent desire to embed Lurianic esoteric customs into mainstream Judaism. In the rabbi’s estimation, these practices have already been widely accepted by the people:The customs of our rabbi [i.e., Luria] have now spread throughout the world and most of the customs that were hitherto practiced according to the pshat [i.e., in a non-kabbalsitic fashion] have been changed by the masses, and everyone practiced [sic] pursuant to the kabbalah of our rab-bi HaARI. Needless to say, this custom [reciting VaYehi No’am] must also be done according to HaARI. In all the synagogues, one must practice thus because it is the truth.41Aside for taking kabbalistic customs, such as Sharabian tikkunim, mainstream, Yosef Hayyim integrated elements from Kabbalistic knowledge into Halakhic rulings. His practices indeed had a substantial impact on Jewish communi-ties in Iraqand beyond, especially the Old Yishuv of Jerusalem. One of the prayers or, to be more accurate, supplications that he composed, exemplifies the mindset of the kabbalists under review. In 1898, Yosef Hayyim published his magnum opus, Sefer Ben Ish Ḥai, in Jerusalem. This book includes an Ara-maic supplication that was meant to be recited on a daily basis before shaḥarit (the morning prayer).42 Soon after, the request was printed on a lone sheet in Baghdad, so that it could be stored inside one’s prayer book. Additionally, it was put out several times by kabbalists in Jerusalem. Within a year of its coinage, then, attempts were made to integrate this work into the accepted liturgy.43 Another book by Yosef Hayyim, Sefer ’Od Yosef Ḥai, which was printed in Jerusalem 1910, contains “The Wording of a Notice and Public Announce-ment” and the following preliminary instructions: “Every person should take the trouble to recite this declaration every day, both on weekdays and on Shab-bat and festivals before the [regular] portion from the akedah [Isaac’s binding]. 41 Ibid, 39b. Hallamish discusses this addition to the Saturday evening prayers; idem, Kabbalistic Customs, 464–468. Also see the English translation in Kassin, Till Eternity, 250–252. Evidence of the kabbalah’s spread in Baghdad and its influence on prayers turns up in David Saliman Sassoon, Massa Bavel. For a disquisition on this topic, albeit an apol-ogetic one based on contemporary Halakhic decisions as well as Haredi and Sephardic polemics, see Hillel, Gevurat ha-Ari, 13–14; idem, Ben Ish Hai, 182–192, 383–384.42 Yosef Hayyim, Ben Ish Ḥai, “Mikeṣ,” §12, 22b–23a.43 Yosef Hayyim, Nosaḥ Bakasha (1898). Also see Ben-Yaakov, Rabbi Yosef Hayyim, 67, 107–110; Hallamish, The Kabbalah in North Africa, 117: Hillel, Ben Ish Hai, 382, where the page is reprinted."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"chapter 5152<UN>There is a great need for this in esoteric circles.” The content of this declaration is interspersed with scathing kabbalistic expressions and quasi-religious te-nets that were meant to be repeated by the faithful. The announcement opens with the following words: “Behold, I wholly and enduringly believe that the Lord our God is the cause behind all causes, the operator of the ten sefirot.... His great light is enclothed in the ten sefirot of atzilut [courtliness]. We raise up the kavvanot of prayer, blessings, praise, and study of the holy Torah.” In other words, the worshipper is being asked to recite a daily affirmation of the essential principles of kabbalah, even if he refrains from personally studying this body of wisdom.44 From 1912 onwards, the supplication and declaration were combined into one and printed in this format time and again, either as a special pamphlet or within the framework of various siddurs. These contexts betray the fact that the two prayers were directed at the general public, not just kabbalists. Like his entreaty to conduct special tikkunim, Yosef Hayyim’s call to recite these prayers on a daily basis was commensurate with his burning desire to tighten the average Jew’s bond with the kabbalah literature.45There were those who ridiculed the Ben Ish Ḥai’s efforts to promote the concealed Torah, including the RaShaSh’s works, among the Jewish hoi pol-loi. Perhaps his harshest critic was one Jacob Obermeyer, a German-Jewish expatriate who taught French in the Baghdad residence of Abbas Mirza, an exiled Persian prince, and at the city’s French-Jewish school, Alliance Israélite Universelle.46 In a long account on religious life in Baghdad, which the He-brew newspaper ha-Magid published in installments over the course of the 1876 year, Obermeyer disdainfully likened Hayyim to a typical Polish rebbe. To begin with, he claimed, the rabbi exploited his ascetic lifestyle and external consecration (Verkheiligheit) to win hearts among the masses. Additionally, he instructed his followers to adopt kabbalah practices, such as fasting on a regu-lar basis and praying with intentions.47 According to Obermeyer, a fair share of 44 Yosef Hayyim, “Kuntress Hut ha-Meshulash,” 24b; idem, Moda’a ve-Gilui Da’at (1912). A similar entreaty turns up in idem, Emunat Itecha, 11–14. Also see Meir, “Toward the Popularization of Kabbalah,” 148–172.45 As he explicitly stated in a letter to David Saliman Sassoon, Bension Mordekhai Hazan was apparently one of the main distributors of the prayer from 1912 onwards. The epistle was printed for the first time in Nurit Veizer, Naim Zmirot, 390 and was subsequently in-cluded in a handful of books, such as Tikkun Hazot (1913); ha-Levi, Pithei Teshuva (1926).46 On Obermeyer’s involvement in Jewish studies, see Markon, “Jacob Obermeyer,” 8. R. Yo-sef Hayyim’s relationship to Alliance Israélite Universelle was complex. See, among other sources, Regev, “Babylonian Rabbis,” 97–118; Yehudah, “Babylonian Jewry,” 45–49; Harel, Between Intrigues and Revolution, 315–317.47 Obermeyer, “Baghdad,” 58."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"153Concealment and Revelation<UN>Iraqi Jewry idolized Yosef Hayyim and spread fabulous tales about their spiritu-al leader. “We can only hope that the masses do not anoint him the second Baal Shem Tov.”48 Obermeyer drew an analogy between Iraqi Jewry’s reverence for Yosef Hayyim and the public standing of the Baal Shem Tov and other Hasidic “saints” that eschewed an official position in the community.49 Taking a page out of the Eastern European Jewish Enlightenment, the peripatetic Maskil ac-cused the Ben Ish Ḥai of forsaking his duties as a Torah scholar by emphasiz-ing mystical literature and practices at the expense of Talmud, Halacha, and Bible. This line of argument imparted Obermeyer’s screed with the semblance of a religious dimension, which was largely eschewed in his later description of this episode in a German language memoir.50 The brunt of Obermeyer’s attack was directed at the fact that Hayyim dared to obligate the masses to engage in yiḥudim and kavvanot that were hitherto the sole preserve of experts: “What would the early kabbalists, who were exclusively concerned with secrecy and modesty, say if they saw such things of utmost importance being given to the mouths of all the ignorant.” For instance, the German Jew pointed out that the RaShaSh’s tikkunim were meant for a smaller cadre of “ Hasids in the city of Jerusalem, may it be built and instituted swiftly in our day.”51 Needless to say, Obermeyewas not looking out for the best interests of the kabbalah litera-ture, but wished to stanch the proliferation of this knowledge and hoped that it would eventually fall into oblivion. The reaction of Baghdad’s rabbis to this assault was harsh. Not only did they unite to defend the Ben Ish Ḥai’s honor, but excommunicated the intruder for his “libelous words.” More specifically, they prohibited the German Jew from attending synagogue and warned the community about him in several newspaper articles.5248 Ibid, 85.49 Interestingly enough, Avraham Yaakov Brawer made a somewhat similar, though favor-able, comparison: “The Baghdadis praise his name (the Ben Ish Hai) the same as the Lithuanian Jews do the name of the Gaon of Vilna.” Brawer, Avak Derakhim, vol. 1, 156–157. Thereafter, he described R. Eliyahu Mani as a miracle worker.50 Obermeyer, “Baghdad,” 77; idem, Modernes Judentum, 43–46.51 Obermeyer, “Baghdad,” 66. Later on, he took issue with the changes that Hayyim im-plemented in various piyutim and prayers as well as the ordinances and practices that the rabbi instituted in the Baghdad Jewish community, to the point of comparing the kabbalist with Abraham Geiger, the founder of Reform Judaism. Obermeyer couched his rebuke as God-fearing criticism. On the other hand, he accused the Ben Ish Ḥai of belit-tling Solomon Ibn Gabirol, Judah Halevi, and other illustrious Jewish poets of yesteryear by casting doubt on the quality of their writing. Also see ibid, 58.52 Sassoon, Somekh, Nissim, “Baghdad,” 207, 214–215, 224–225; “Baghdad (supplement to ha-Levanon),” which was endorsed by several Baghdadi rabbis.

By dint of these steps, the Iraqi rabbi helped expand the circle of both kabbalah scholars and lay practitioners alike. That said, he placed clear restrictions on the distribution of this corpus and distinguished between practices that are suitable for the general public and those reserved for a small elite. For instance, Hayyim limited the full repertoire of kavvanot to a select few and the distribution of the RaShaSh’s siddur to manuscript cop-ies. This intricate balancing act between stint and dissemination and between concealment and revelation were embraced by the ensuing generation of kab-balists in Jerusalem and beyond. The Borders of Dissemination and the Expansion of the Circle of IntentersCriticism against spreading the Lurianic and Sharabian intentions, which was also voiced years before the siddur’s printing, was now targeted at those pos-sessing the manuscript copies. The dissemination of the RaShaSh’s siddur in both manuscript and print form was greeted by numerous attempts to limit their distribution or to warn the book’s recipients that it takes considerable time and effort to reach the rank of mekhavven. Not only did these efforts fail to prevent the outspread of the kavvanot, but it was the very critics who spear-headed the printing enterprise. For instance, Dweck-HaKohen backed the first printed edition of the siddur, which he graced with annotations titled Hesed veEmet. However, these comments were absent from the ensuing volumes. According to a later tradition passed on by his students, the revered kabbal-ist distanced himself from the sequels because he was unsatisfied with how the distribution process had played out.53 Correspondingly, small prayers for special occasions were released in booklet form, albeit without the publisher’s name or the year of publication (though it is obvious that they were printed to issue a public apology, but the newspapers refused to run his statement. He was ulti-mately forced to plead guilty before a local Jewish court and publically ask Yosef Hayyim for forgiveness. For an in-depth look at this episode, see Ben-Yaakov, The Jews of Iraq in Modern Times, 196–202; idem, Rabbi Yosef Hayyim, 28–29; Snir, “Arabic Journalism,” 223. For an apologetic discussion, see Hillel, Ben Ish Hai, 182-219-206; Sassoon, A History of the Jews in Baghdad, 153–156.53 Hillel, “The Life of Dweck-HaKohen,” 43."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"155Concealment and Revelation<UN>in Jerusalem by intenter-kabbalists). These pamphlets were tailor made for kabbalistic synagogues dedicated to Sharabian prayer services.54In light of the above, Dweck-HaKohen endeavored to restrict these siddurs to outstanding Torah scholars. This message comes across loud and clear at the outset of Sefer Benayahu ben Yehoyada (1911), which includes Lurianic and Sharabian yiḥudim, prayers, kavvanot, costumes, and tikkunim “for the soul.” Rehovot haNahar’s founder expressly prohibited owners of the RaShaSh’s prayer book from selling, exchanging, or transferring it without permission. Moreover, he warned that “the spirit of the sages will not rest from” anyone that violates this injunction55 Approvals for the book were provided by Shlo-mo Elyashiv, Yosef Chaim Zonnenfeld, and Menahem Menkhin Halperin. The latter two praised those who conduct Sharabian tikkunim and stressed the importance of disseminating the kabbalah. Moreover, they urged those “who have already learnt pshat” to attend a kabbalah lecture on a daily basis.In 1914, Rehovot haNahar put out another version of the RaShaSh’s siddur with, among other components, his intentions for the bedtime Kriyat sh’ma. The foreword included a word of caution to those who have yet to master the gospel of HaARI and the RaShaSh: “It is forbidden for them to take this book and pray with the intentions in it. Not everyone who wants to wield the name [of God] should come and take it lest he will, heaven forbid, chop down saplings.”56 Later that year, Sha’ar haShamayim released a new edition of this same siddur in which these same restrictions were expressed in softer terms: “Not everyone should proceed to the holiness to pray with intentions from this holy siddur, only one who has already delved into the works of HaARI and the holy book Nahar Shalom.”57 In sum, the talk of widely expanding the ranks of kabbalah students and practitioners was hedged with qualifications as to who was eligible to pursue the labor of intentions.Around fifteen years after Sha’ar haShamayim printed the first edition of the RaShaSh’s siddur, and perhaps in response to this, Yaakov Chaim Sofer (1870–1939), among Rehovot haNahar’s sages, asserted “that not every man can 54 See, for example, the pamphlets under the heading Regel Ta’aniyot; Tokhen Kaṿanot. These works do not include the year of publication, but the print style attests to the fact that they came out in post-1910 Jerusalem. Scholem added the following handwritten remark on his own copy of Tokhen Kaṿanot: “Printed in approximately 1930, and it is a precious finding, very much.” Lastly, it appears that Jacob S. Kassin had a hand in bringing this work to press.55 Dweck-HaKohen and Lag'imi, Sefer Benayahu ben Yehoyada, vol. 1.56 Sefer Ḥayim ṿeShalom (1914).57 Siddur Ḥayim ṿeShalom (1914)."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"chapter 5156<UN>pray with intention, only the Hasids that are in Beit El, may it be grounded on justice, in our holy city of Jerusalem, who properly learn the liturgy from the mouth of authors and from the mouth of books, and they pray from the siddur of the RaShaSh, and none except for them, for there is a possibility that it will lead to damage, God forbid. Instead, they [i.e., the masses] should pray with intentions in a general fashion.”58 These admonishments notwithstanding, the reality throughout the early twentieth century was more complex. At the time, there were several kabbalists who undertook to print collections featuring parts, rather than full sections, of the RaShaSh’s siddur. The focus of this enter-prise was on special tikkunim and customs, some of which had already come out earlier. In 1911, for example, Dweck-HaKohen and Eliyahu Lag’imi (who as above-mentioned arranged the first volume of the siddur), printed a series of books on the prayer intentions that were partially based on the RaShaSh’s sid-dur.59 Among the most prominent compilers of these types of works were Ja-cob S. Kassin, Noah Gad Weintraub, and Yeshayah Asher Zelig Margaliot, all of whom hewed to the spirit and received the permission of Dweck-HaKohen.60In parallel, various comments, annotations, and in-depth studies on the RaShaSh’s siddur and intentions were brought to press. Witten in the cen-turies following Sharabi’s passing, most of the authors of these works were affiliated with Beit El and/or Rehovot haNahar.61 Some of these projects mer-ited Dweck-HaKohen’s support.62 Books of this sort were printed earlier, but this wave appears to have been informed by greater urgency. Perhaps this ac-tivity was fueled by the expansion of the circles of mekhavvnim. Whereas the earlier works (e.g., editions of Sefer Shemen Sasson by Sasson ben Moshe) were earmarked for seasoned intenters, the new round of books also targeted less proficient audiences. Rahamim David Shrem (1869–1934), a habitué of Rehov-ot haNahar, toiled to collect kabbalistic responsa that pertain to the RaShaSh’s 58 Sofer, Kaf ha-Ḥayim: Orah Hayyim, §61, 101a.

According to its cover, the work’s “benefit is quite lofty for those worshipping God with intention [who would like] to understand the siddur of the RaShaSh, may his virtue protect us amen, [along] with Nahar Shalom and Rehovot haNahar’s introduction;” Harrari, Sefer ’Alei Nahar."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"157Concealment and Revelation<UN>siddur and HaARI’s oeuvre. Most of the answers that he cited were formulated by his close associates Dweck-HaKohen and Avraham Antebbi. The purpose behind this initiative, according to Shrem, was to pave the way for beginners entering “the wisdom of truth.”63 In 1921, Massoud Alhadad HaKohen also printed kabbalistic responsa on, inter alia, the RaShaSh’s siddur, but his work was not intended for novices. Instead, it catered specifically to kabbalists in-volved in reconciling contradictions between Luria and Sharabi’s thought. Surprisingly, most of the questions that Beit El’s rosh yeshiva included in his responsa were not posed by his seminary’s regulars, but a Hasid-cum-kabbalist in Eastern Europe.64 Needless to say, there would not have been a market for these comprehensive responsa were it not for the dissemination of the siddur, which was prompted by the growth of the circle of Sharabian intenters and a general increase in kabbalah students.Some observers felt that the publication of these collections attests to a drop off in the number of mekhavvnim. For instance, Pascal Themanlys, a disciple of the Polish occultist Max Théon,65 wrote about an encounter with the Jeru-salem kabbalist Yaakov ben Yosef Rofeh Munseh. “When I got to Jerusalem,” 63 Shrem, Sha’arei Raḥamim, vols. 1–2 (1926–1928); idem, Sha’arei Derekh haḤayim (1931). The books were outfitted with approvals from Yosef Chaim Zonnenfeld, Yosef Yedid Ha-levi, Dweck-HaKohen, Aharon Shlomo Maharil, Yaakov Chaim Sofer, Hezekiah Sabtai, Shalom Hedaya, and Jacob Kassin. That said, one tradition casts doubt on the quality and trustworthiness of these responsa. Nonetheless, they constitute a treasure trove of sig-nificant information. This comment pertains to the first volume, but not the second. The latter seems to have been arranged by Jacob S. Kassin, so that its content is more accurate. See Hillel, “The Life of Dweck-HaKohen,” 13–14, 37–38; idem, “The Life of Kassin,” 63–68. For more on Shrem and his books, see Ben-Yaakov, The Travelling Envoy, vol. 1, 20–23; Shrem, Sefer Raḥshai Lev, 10–12; Laniado, LaQedoshim asher baAReṢ, 178–179.64 HaKohen, Sefer Simḥat Kohen. In his introductory words, Alhadad HaKohen wrote that most of the questions were put forth by the kabbalist Gedalya Ehringer from Kolomyya. The relevant passages in the book imply that the Eastern European had a copy of the sid-dur. See, for example, ibid, 73a.65 Pascal Themanlys (1909–2000) founded the Argaman circles in 1980. Nearly fifty years earlier, he wrote a book in French on the wonders of the Ba’al Shem Tov. A self-proclaimed adherent of the kabbalah way, Themanlys personally met numerous kabbalists in the Land of Israel (Themanlys, Siḥu beKhol Niflaotaṿ, 48–49, 62; idem, “The Bett El Kabbal-ist,” 22–25; idem, The History of Beit El (ms); idem, “Bethel Foyer du Hassidisme Sefardi,” xxv–xxvi; idem, Un itinéraire de Paris à Jérusalem, 90–92; idem, “Prophecy Today,” 195–201). He was critical of how Jewish mysticism was being taught in Haredi society and cast doubt on the approach of Buber, Scholem, and the like (Themanlys, Siḥu beKhol Niflaotaṿ, 53–55). Lastly, he claimed to have spoken with David Ben-Gurion in various settings. Dur-ing these conversations, the former tangentially brought up the importance of the Zohar"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"chapter 5158<UN>Themanlys quotes the kabbalist, “I met people who were like prophets. Shortly after, there were other teachers who conversed with angels. Now there are ob-viously sages, but nothing more than this.... Only a number of years ago, there were over a hundred mekhavvnim in Jerusalem, and today there are but a few. In order to counteract this shortcoming, we must compile a prayer book with simple intentions for use in many groups.”66Zvi Meroni conveyed similar sentiments that he had heard from “one of Je-rusalem’s elder kabbalists:” “In the worldwide war [i.e., the First World War], many kabbalists died of hunger and very few of the elders of this wisdom are still alive. In Safad, the bygone cradle of the kabbalah, you will barely find so much as a single kabbalist, what compels us to make an effort to secure the kabbalah’s future and pass it down to the next generations.”67 These worries aside, Jerusalem was, as Meroni himself testified, teeming with kabbalists. At any rate, the stewards of Jewish mysticism began to conceive of printing as a new way to bequeath this knowledge to posterity and newcomers in the field, like the younger sages at Sha’ar haShamayim. As is known, the popularization and dissemination of the kabbalah literature divulged only one facet of this corpus. Along with an increase in students, the need for revelation was tied to the paucity of mekhavvnim and the necessity of training a new generation. The publication of the above-mentioned collections and books was meant to persuade and serve as a gateway for serious candidates weighing the possibility of dedicating their lives to Jewish mysticism.The printing of different parts and editions of the RaShaSh’s siddurs be-tween 1911 and 1930 was the catalyst behind the publication of dozens of simi-lar books – an undertaking that has endured into the present era. As Yaakov Moshe Hillel put it in an approval for a manuscript version of the siddur that was finally published in the early 1980s, “Since the sages allowed” the siddur to be disseminated, “great geniuses in the revealed and concealed occupied themselves with and helped print” the first edition; “in any event, from that point on, the siddur has already merited exposure and publication, and we (ibid, 52).

In this context, the words of the journalist Yitzchak Nahum Levi (also known as Levi Yitzchak Yerushalmi) bear noting. His 1948 book offers a romantic description of the Beit El Yeshiva, which ends on a pessimistic note: “However, the number of mekhavvnim is steadily dwindling, and who knows if others from the new generation will come to fill their position.” Levi, Shabatot biYerushalayim, 41–46.

Each edition re-flects the contents of another manuscript. In this respect, the attempt to can-onize the siddur failed, but the number of people praying with intentions was on the rise. Menahem Menkhin Halperin and the Printing of the Lurianic CorpusThe second milestone of this “print revolution” was the publication of the Lu-rianic kabbalah literature on the basis of manuscripts and first print editions. Some of these same texts were already printed in Jerusalem between 1863 and 1873 by Beit El’s sages, who indeed took advantage of their seminary’s manu-scripts. This earlier wave catered primarily to the extended Beit El community. It is also worth noting that a few of the books were correspondingly printed in Salonica.69 From 1875 to 1885, Yechezkel Shraga Halberstam, the grand rabbi of Sieniawa, presided over a similar venture in Eastern Europe (Krakow and Premishlan).70 The market could not keep up with the demand for copies 68 Hillel, “Introduction,” Siddur Nahar Shalom, vol. 1, 2. For more on the printing of Sharabi’s prayer book, see Meir, “The Boundaries of the Kabbalah,” 163–180.69 Ben Menachem, “Kitvei Rabbi Ḥayyim Vital;” haLevi, The First Jerusalem Books; Gries, “The Part of the Printing,” 162–168; Ben-Nae, “The Yeshivot in Jerusalem,” 339–340. The lion’s share of this printing enterprise can be attributed to the grand plans of the Beit El Yeshiva. The final books in this quasi-series were Vital, Sha’ar Ma’amrei RaSHBI (1898); idem, HaSha’ar haShmini, Sha’ar haGilgulim (1903). The printing of kabbalah and theur-gist books in the Land of Israel during these years is discussed in Kandelshein, Printed Publications, 184–275, 323–327. For a look at this activity in the broader context of the printing industry throughout the 1900s, see Gries, “Copying and Printing of Kabbalistic Books,” 204–211.70 Ben Menachem, “Kitvei Rabbi Ḥayyim Vital.” Some of the manuscripts that undergirded Halberstam’s editions were purchased by the rebbe in the Land of Israel. To the best of our knowledge, he wrote approvals and introductions to kabbalah books until the 1890s. Some of these works were assembled under a single heading; see Halberstam, Sefer Di-vrei Yeḥezqel heḤadash, 132–133, 229–235. In one letter, the grand rabbi clamored for the publication of an array of kabbalah books; ibid, “HaRAMAQ,” 101–106. That said, Halber-stam apparently limited the study of kabbalah to a small cadre of his Hasids; ibid, Sefer Divrei Yeḥezqel ’al haTorah, 68–69; Rabinowitz, Sefer Meorot haARI, 4; Wagschal, Sefer 13 Orot, 204. As per a later tradition, “they did not hear about ‘Zohar’ in Sieniawa, namely they did not speak of kabbalah issues;” ibid, 120. In all likelihood, then, the books that Halberstam printed or recommended were of more use to kabbalists and Hasids outside"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"chapter 5160<UN>of the earlier Eastern-European and Land-of-Israel editions, which served the RaShaSh’s acolytes and Hasids in these “markets.” Due to the kabbalah’s resurgence in the Land of Israel (and perhaps overseas as well) there was a palpable need for new books. The manuscripts of these same Lurianic works were once again copied in large numbers by kabbalists, but not all the relevant institutions had the means to fund these projects. Against this backdrop, it is evident that HaARI’s works were eagerly studied, copied, and printed during the second half of the nineteenth century. By the early 1900s, the supply of this commodity was outpaced by demand.71 This corpus was the ballast for the Beit El-inspired kabbalah revival in the Land of Israel. The impetus behind the printing of its works was the fledgling Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva, which ral-lied the kabbalists of Rehovot haNahar, among others, to join the cause.The prime mover and shaker of this early twentieth-century enterprise was R. Menahem Menkhin Halperin from Grodno (1834–1924), one of the more in-fluential kabbalists in Sha’ar haShamayim.72 Following the path of Zvi Hirsch Kalischer, he established Ḥevrat Dorshei Ṣiyon ve’Yerushalayim (Well-wishers of Zion and Jerusalem Society) – an association in Grodno with the mandate to acquire property in Palestine.73 During this period, Halperin built a close relationship with Shlomo Elyashiv. While still in Hrodna, he was recognized as a kabbalist and “wonder worker,” who is even said to have exorcized a dybbuk.74 In 1901, he moved to Jerusalem where he forged close ties with sages of Rehovot his court. The rebbe’s activities in this field were informed by a dynamic that would loom large throughout the twentieth century and beyond: appreciable dissemination of the kabbalah literature coupled with statements limiting its study to those with the requisite qualifications. See, for instance, the Biala-Lugano rebbe’s approach; Meir, “The Revealed and the Revealed within the Concealed,” 231–241.71 Many of Hayyim Vital’s works were copied over the course of the nineteenth century in Palestine and abroad. Some of these manuscripts reached the Israel National Library be-tween 1924 and 1930, following a spate of printing in Jerusalem. See Scholem, Catalogus codicum cabbalisticorum hebraicorum. During that same period, some of Beit El’s manu-scripts were sold by Isaac Gagin, “Hasfarim” (1920); reprinted in Kluger, Min haMeqor, vol. 4, 115. On this collection and its sale, see Gaon, Oriental Jews, vol. 2, 187–188; Avivi, Kabbala Luriana, vol. 2, 683; Schidorsky, “Cultural Agents,” 378–379.72 Ben Menachem, “Kitvei Rabbi Ḥayyim Vital,” 278–279.73 Established in 1872, the name was subsequently changed to Shutafut shel Yishuv Ereṣ Yis-rael de’Hrodna (the Hrodna Partnership for Settling the Land of Israel).

Yet another of his confidantes was Abraham Isaac Kook.75On his personal copy of Sefer Eṣ Ḥayyim (Warsaw 1891), Gershom Scholem added a few handwritten biographical details about Halperin: “Rabbi Mena-hem Menkhin Halperin was the head of the Ḥevrat Elshikh Beit Midrash in Grodno for many years; and was considered a holy man of God owing to the fact that he did not want to derive pleasure from a penny that is not his; and his livelihood was from the sale of the books all year long and from Etrogs in their season; and nearly every year he travelled to Palestine to bring them.”76 Some of the books in Halperin’s personal library (among them Sefer Etert Yosef, Zhovkva 1778; and Sefer Sha’ar haGilgulim, Zhovkva 1772) eventually found their way into Scholem’s collection.77Halperin is best known for his book Kvod Ḥakhamim, which justifies the study of the Lurianic work Ḥemdat Yamim. More specifically, it contends with the assertions of R. Jacob Emden and the research of David Kahana whereby Ḥemdat Yamim was a Sabbatean book and should thus be banned.78 Halperin’s book was pummeled by several figures, including Mordechai ben Moshe Luria who penned a double-edged crtique.79 Be that as it may, most kabbalists in the Land of Israel agreed with him on the merits of Ḥemdat Yamim.80 For instance, the Hasid and kabbalist Elazar Mordechai Koenig, one of Sha’ar haShamayim’s 75 Shapira, Igrot laRAIaH, 162 (letter 103). Halperin wrote that R. Kook’s small kabbalistic book, Rosh Milim (London 1916), is “marvelous, the marvel, and a marvel;” ibid, 211–212 (letter 131). See the photo of this epistle in Neria, BeSde haRAIa, 252; Halperin, “Letter to R. Kook,” 34.76 The Library of Gershom Scholem, vol 2, 322. Similar biographical details on Halperin turn up in Mordechai Gimpel Berg’s letter to Abraham Schwadron (ms). The Schwad-ron Collection houses a 1904 letter from the Menachem Ṣiyon Beit Midrash, signed by Halperin. See Beit Midrash Menaḥem Ṣiyon, Letter (ms). In addition, he was involved in the sextonship of a few other Toranic institutions in Jerusalem, such as the Torat Hayyim Yeshiva.77 Halperin’s seal graces his items in this collection. Likewise, Scholem attained the books from the library of another Sha’ar haShamayim habitué, Aharon Shlomo Maharil, whose signature is inscribed on the covers.

In any event, Halperin defended his approach in correspondences that he maintained with Hasids and kabbalists throughout Eastern Europe.The nub of Halperin’s printing enterprise was the publication of R. Hayyim Vital’s works. The Sha’ar haShamayim regular began putting out kabbalah texts back in Warsaw. To begin with, he published a new edition of Vital’s Eṣ Ḥayyim in 1891, together with Aaron Walden (1835–1912) – a Hasidic book merchant and bibliographer.82 In the opening pages of this edition, Halperin wrote that he availed himself of a manuscript belonging to R. Alexander Ziskind of Grod-no (the author of Yesod Veshoresh Ha’Avoda) as well as annotations by Elyas-hiv. He also incorporated the RaShaSh’s commentary on Eṣ Ḥayyim, which is called Emet veShalom. Moreover, the distinguished intenter’s books Reḥovot haNahar and Nahar Shalom were affixed to this publication, each with their own pagination. In so doing, Halperin emulated a previous Jerusalem edition of Eṣ Ḥayyim from 1866. Lastly, he clarified and proofread the text to the best of his ability and included his own annotations and explanations. This edition, which was surely intended for Hasids and kabbalists in Eastern Europe, of-fered a comprehensive and novel blend between literature from the Sharabian school of thought and other kabbalah streams.81 Blau, “Ḥemdat Yamim,” 161–166. According to one tradition, Koenig studied under Dweck-HaKohen at Rehovot haNahar. Ḥemdat Yamim maintained its relevance in the early twen-tieth century; Ya’ari, “Sifrei Tiqunim ṿeTfilot,” 103–104. A contemporary kabbalist claims that “I heard from the kabbalist R. Shalom Hedaya, who heard from his father, that all the sages of Beit El studied the book Ḥemdat Yamim,” Afg’in, Sefer Divrei Shalom, vol. 10, 171. Mordechai ben Moshe Luria argued that the hypothesis according to which the book is “kosher” because it was commonplace among Sephardim does not hold water. As he wrote in “Emet LeYa’aqov,” 67b: “It is obvious that one must not bring evidence from the Sephardic sages on this matter because the book Ḥemdat Yamim spread among them be-fore the books of Jacob Emden. Moreover, Israel Baal Shem Tov and the holiness of his disciples were unknown to them.” In any event, there is little doubt that the book was also popular among Ashkenazim. See, for example, the Hasidic notice: Ḥevrat Ḥafeṣ Ḥayim, Moda’a ’al Ta’anit (1933).82 Walden is best known for the Hasidic hagiographies that he wrote and published.

From 1902 onwards, he put out seven volumes of HaARI’s writing, some of which contain the publisher’s own notes and explanations on the margins. Buoyed by the unparalleled success of the said Warsaw edition, he published a new edition in the same format in 1910.83 Halperin’s foreword to his 1909 edition of Sefer Shaʻar Hahaqdamot divulges a few of the motivations behind his labor:I thank God for granting me [the privilege of ] publishing Sefer Shaʻar Hahaqdamot and serving as a messenger for the holy commandment of disseminating the kabbalah study, and slaking the thirst of the Torah scholars who are pondering the true Torah. Hark, if the shortage of books in kabbalah studies was indeed evident in earlier periods, recently the void indeed feels even more greater [sic]. Since then by means of the illustrious yeshiva Sha’ar haShamayim for the Study of the Kabbalah, which was founded with the help of God in the holy city for the Ash-kenazic rabbis, the elders of instruction, and the greats of Torah. From season to season, the members of the seminary increase to the point where the study of the true Torah is commonplace among all the Torah scholars; and this study has spread so much to the point that the yeshiva Sha’ar haShamayim inside the [walled] city has given birth to another branch in the large settlement outside the city as well. There are many for whom the way is too far to come. For this reason, we established for them within their settlement a second yeshiva for learning kabbalah by the name of Kahal Hasidim, a branch of the yeshiva Sha’ar haShamayim. A river emanates from Eden and spreads out and expands to the point where our holy city of Jerusalem is filled with people studying the Torah of kabbalah; and what this means for the rectification of the nation and the rectification of the upper spheres is already known to those familiar with the concealed wisdom.8483 Vital, Eṣ Hayyim (1910). This edition was published at the behest of R. Moshe ben David Aligula and Moshe Haim Manshvari. The rest of the books that Halperin printed are as follows: Vital, Sha’ar haKaṿanot (1902); idem, Sefer Mavo She’arim (1904); idem, Sefer Oṣrot Ḥayyim (1907); idem, Sefer Sha’ar Hahaqdamot (1909); idem, Sha’ar Ruaḥ haQodesh (1912); idem, Sefer haLiqutim (1913). Many of the volumes merited facsimiles in Israel during the second half of the twentieth century; some were brought to press by Mordecai Attiya within the framework of the Haim veShalom Yeshiva.84 Vital, Sha’ar haHaqdamot, Introduction. He printed the book with the assistance of Refael Schwilli and Moshe ben David Aligula."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"chapter 5164<UN>A few insights into Halperin’s world, not least his ties with various kabbalists in the Land of Israel, can also be gleaned from his introductions to the other works that he brought to press. For instance, Sefer Shaʻar haKaṿanot (1902) opens with a discussion on the Land of Israel and the kabbalah secrets that he believed reveal themselves exclusively in the Land. Moreover, the author paid tribute to Shlomo Moussaieff for granting him access to his library and its manuscripts.85 Sefer Mavo She’arim (1904), which was proofread by Hal-perin and brought to press by Shlomo Baruch ben David Tzofioff HaCohen and Moshe Pinchas Tzofioff HaCohen, also begins with words on the dissemination of Jewish mystical knowledge. Shlomo Baruch Tzofioff ’s foreword states that his father, R. David, had hoped to print all of HaARI’s works, “to hand them out to [the seed of ] Jacob, and to distribute them in Israel free of charge in an eye-pleasing and choice print cleansed of every error and mistake that befell, as is known, the previous runs.”86 There were certain discrepancies between some of the copies of Mavo She’arim with respect to the cover page, introduction, and conclusion. For example, the Tzofioff brothers’ introduction was replaced by that of Halperin, in his capacity as “the author, compiler, and typesetter of the annotations and explanations.” In addition, it included a debt of gratitude to R. Ze’ev Wolf Ashkenazi and Ezra Raful.87Three years later, Halperin edited and printed Vital’s Sha’ar Ruaḥ haQodesh (1912). Words by the publisher’s confidante and fellow Sha’ar haShamayim habitué, R. Aharon Shlomo Maharil, who helped bring the book to press, were incorporated into this work. Moreover, it begins with, inter alia, encomia for the seminary’s resident kabbalists.88 At the time, Maharil was involved with 85 Ibid. Attached to this publication is Shlomo ben Yehuda HaCohen’s Sefer Yafa Sha’a, which comes with its own pagination and a new cover. Moreover, it was distributed as a separate volume.86 Vital, Sefer Mavo She’arim. Similar information is provided by Munseh, Pada et Avraham, vol. 1, 426. Shlomo Tzofioff was married to Ḥaim Shaul Dweck-HaKohen’s daughter. For more on this, see the introduction to his grandfather’s book: Sefer Emet meAram Ṣoba (1910).87 The two copies are held in the Gershom Scholem Collection at the Israel National Library. It stands to reason that while the book was in press, Halperin realized that he lacked the means to foot the entire bill. Therefore, he worked out a deal with the Tzofioff brothers ac-cording to which some of the copies would be printed in their name. Another possibility is that to begin with, these were two separate versions for different audiences: Halperin’s readership consisted of Sha’ar haShamayim’s kabbalists and their supporters in East Eu-rope; the Tzofioff brothers catered to the Sephardic kabbalists in the Land of Israel. A list of corrections was added solely to Halperin’s version.88 Vital, Sha’ar Ruaḥ haQodesh (1912). Also see R.

Dweck-HaKohen provided his commentary Eifa Shlema, while Halperin proofread and typeset the book. Furthermore, this work was studded with enthusiastic approvals from Tzvi Hirsh Shapira (the grand rabbi of Munkacs) and Shlomo Elyashiv. At an ear-lier date, Halperin had indeed raved to Elyashiv about Dweck-HaKohen and the sages of the Rehovot haNahar Yeshiva. All those studying kabbalah were commended in these approvals for hastening the redemption, but their focus was on Dweck-HaKohen’s additions. In essence, the Grodno native formed ties between kabbalah practitioners in Eastern Europe and the RaShaSh’s acolytes in the Land of Israel.Some writers contend that Dweck-HaKohen was in need of these external approvals because of complaints that his interpretations strayed from the path of the righteous.90 However, it appears that the main reason Halperin incorporated these recommendations was to bridge the gap between kabbal-ists from different ethnic groups and streams. As noted, collaborative efforts stood behind the printing of Eṣ Hayyim in Warsaw and the first edition of the RaShaSh’s siddur in Jerusalem, both of which also required approvals from Eastern European sages. With respect to this edition of Sefer Oṣrot Ḥayyim, kabbalists from the various streams agreed that every Torah-educated Jew is obligated to study kabbalah: “Not like those same fools who exempt them-selves from learning kabbalah, on the grounds that they have yet to fill their stomachs with the six books of the Talmud and the Halakhic adjudicators. On this [matter] one of the great sages said, A person who openly abrogates the concealed, the presumption is that he will furtively abrogate the revealed.”91 In 89 Maharil, Sefer To’ameiah Ḥayim Zakhu, vols. 1–3; idem, Sefer Birur haMidot; idem, Pirqei Avot ha’Olam haQadmonim; idem, Sefer Mesilot Ḥokhma. For more on this figure, see Ben Menachem, “Kitvei Rabbi Ḥayim Vital,” 309; Eliakh, Sefer haGaon, vol. 2, 813. His approvals surface in many of the kabbalah books that were printed in Jerusalem during these same years.90 According to Hillel, “One day, two sages from the cult of the Talmudists came up to Rabbi Nissim Nahum and heaped scorn on our rabbi Dweck-HaKohen, saying that he is a mod-ernizer, is turning all the conventions and norms on their head.... And they told him that it is forbidden to publish a subversive book of this sort, and its absence is better than its existence.” As a result, Hillel continued, Dweck-HaKohen decided to turn “to the most important kabbalists in the Diaspora, for approvals. In all likelihood, this quaint story is unfounded;” Hillel, “The Life of Dweck-HaKohen,” 42.91 Vital, Sefer Oṣrot Hayyim, Introduction. The book was republished in Tunisia 1913, sans most of Dweck-HaKohen’s annotations and explanations. That said, some of his words"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"chapter 5166<UN>the preface, Dweck-HaKohen lauded the members of the Bukharan commu-nity in Jerusalem. For instance, praise is given to Shlomo Moussaieff for cover-ing the print costs, maintaining the Rehovot haNahar Yeshiva, “and looking out for the rabbis and their students who are occupied with this wisdom, namely the wisdom of truth, and by virtue of their lobbying, their alacrity, and their diligence founded a synagogue within their society for sages that pray accord-ing to HaARI’s intentions as per the arrangement of the RaShaSh of blessed memory.”92 On these topics, then, Rehovot haNahar and Sha’ar haShamayim were of one mind.Halperin also played an instrumental role in other ventures of this sort. Among the books that he brought to press was a manuscript edition of David ibn Zimra’s commentary Peirush Klaley Qiṣur Sefer haPlia, which was housed in Moussaieff ’s library.93 In another initiative, he attached a few of HaARI’s works to the Ashkenazi kabbalist Jacob Judah Levy’s commentary on Pirkei Avot. This work also included the notes of the ascetic R. Yehoshua Tzvi Michal Shapira. Both Levy and Shapira were among the resident scholars of the Beit El Yeshiva.94The links between various kabbalists and their publishing collaborations also surface in approvals that Halperin wrote for other works. A case in point is a recommendation that he co-authored with R. Yosef Ḥaim Zonnenfeld in 1911 for one of Dweck-HaKohen’s books. After praising the dissemination of kabbalistic knowledge, they proclaimed “that in the End of the Days, those learning the Torah of kabbalah will multiply.” What is more, the two authors “gave sound advice to the students who have already learnt the pshat [literal explanation], that they should also give [sic] a lesson every day for the study of the kabbalah wisdom.”95from the Jerusalem edition, including a prayer with intentions that is meant to be recited before learning Torah, can be found towards the end of this one.92 Vital, Sefer Oṣrot Ḥayyim, Introduction.93 Halperin, Peirush Klaley Qiṣur Sefer haPlia.

In Jerusalem, there were other agents of Lurianic literature besides Halperin, all of whom worked along the same lines. Most of their enterprise consisted of proofreading and printing – be it alone or en masse – the works of HaARI and Hayyim Vital. The following players bear mention:[a] R. Ze’ev Wolf Ashkenazi (1865–1945). A native of Pinsk (a city in modern-day Belarus), Ashkenazi spent time in Safad before enrolling in Jerusa-lem’s Eṣ Ḥayyim Yeshiva. Like Halperin, he put out new editions of works by HaARI, Vital and Moses ben Jacob Cordovero (the RaMaK), which included Ashkenazi’s own notes and innovations. At times, the activist drew on odd manuscripts and versions that he happened upon.96 In the introduction to Ashkenazi’s 1905 edition of HaSha’ar haḤamishi, Sha’ar haMiṣṿot, the publisher thanks his friend Halperin for goading him into improving the text and helping him finish the proofs.97 This partner-ship between the two kabbalists endured, as Halperin’s annotations and corrections were added to Ashkenazi’s 1907 edition of Sefer ’Olat Ta-mid. A couple of insights on Ashkenazi’s ideology and his motivations for spreading Lurianic thought may be gleaned from the foreword to HaSha’ar haRevi’i, Sha’ar haPsuqim, where he referred to HaARI’s writ-ing as a tool for understanding the Zohar and to the importance of read-ing the Zohar even without understanding it, “as the very language of the Zohar is capable of cleansing the spirit and consecrating his soul in purity.”98 What is more, Ashkenazi brought to press two other popular kabbalah books: Hayyim Vital’s Sefer Sha’arei Qedusha; and Sefer Tomer 96 He prepared the following editions: Vital, HaSha’ar haḤamishi, Sha’ar haMiṣṿot (1905); idem, Sefer ’Olat Tamid (1907); idem, HaSha’ar haRevi’i, Sha’ar haPsuqim (1912); idem, HaSha’ar haRevi’i, Sefer haLiqutim (1913). The last two books were brought to print by Reuven Haas.

These works, which are interspersed with the agent’s annotations and insights, certainly merited a wider distribution.99[b] The Hasid R. Zalman Leib Halevi Leventhal (1876–1942).100 Born in Jeru-salem, Leventhal was a resident scholar of the city’s Ḥayei Olam Yeshiva and was on close terms with kabbalists at Beit El. In 1906, he printed the second part of R. Hayyim Vital’s Sefer ‘Eṣ haDa’at Tov, on the basis of a manuscript that he purchased from the Gagin family. Leventhal intended to put out other volumes that he gleaned from this source; however, his plan was thwarted by financial difficulties.101 Among the many approvals that Leventhal’s edition garnered is one by Jacob Elyashar and Yitzchak Blazer. Moreover, an approval by R. Kook, which was penned at the begin-ning of his tenure in Jaffa, waxes poetic on the kabbalah and its revival in the Land of Israel.102 This book also warrants attention due to the long list of subscribers – most of whom were residents of Palestine – that graces its appendix. The list is comprised of Ashkenazim and Sephardim, Hasids and misnagdim, along with a handful of kabbalists, among them Shimon Zvi Lider (Horowitz), Yaakov Moshe Charlap, Shlomo Moussaieff, Shlomo Wechsler, and Yom Tov Yedid Halevi.[c] Reuben Haas. Aside for the RaShaSh’s above-noted siddur, Haas teamed up with Ze’ev Wolf Ashkenazi to bring several of HaARI’s works to press.103 Moreover, he printed another edition of Sefer Sha’ar haGilgulim 99 Vital, Sefer Sha’arei Qedusha (1926); Cordovero, Sefer Tomer Dvora (1928).100 For bibliographical information on Leventhal, see Tidhar, Encyclopedia of the Pioneers, vol. 9, 3255–3256; Ben Menachem, “Kitvei Rabbi Ḥayim Vital,” 281–282.101 Vital, Sefer ‘Eṣ haDa‘at Tov (1906). The publisher unfurls all the details behind the manuscript’s procurement in the opening pages of the book.

The following passage captures the essence of R. Kook’s approval: “And the merit of our holy master, the rabbi Hayyim Vital shall stand behind all those advancing this labor of the heavens to shine a new light, a light that already was over Zion, for all its beauty, from the most delightful and beloved Torah of Eretz Yisrael that emanates from the Holy of Holies, our divine rabbi of blessed memory who is a resi-dent of honor in our Land, the coveted Land, may it be built and instituted in our day amen.

He anonymously printed Minhagei haARI as well as a compendium of texts from various books on the kabbalah.105...Massoud Alhadad HaKohen’s Sefer Simḥat Kohen (1921), which includes re-sponsa on the output of HaARI and the RaShaSh, epitomizes the importance of these same texts to the city’s kabbalists. With the objective of enhanc-ing his book, Beit El’s rosh yeshiva incorporated a manuscript containing a homiletic work on Lurianic thought that he found in the seminary’s archives: “And to adorn my book,” Alhadad wrote on the cover, “I presented in the be-ginning the holy book Drosh Heftziba by our holy rabbi, Hayyim Vital, which was hitherto stored in a manuscript that an eye has not gazed upon.”106 Sefer Simḥat Kohen includes approvals by its publisher’s colleagues at the Beit El Yeshiva (one bears the signatures of Nahman Angil, Avraham Bijajo, Avraham Azriel, Yitzchak Alfiyah, and Shalom Hedaya). It also merited approvals from Rabbi Zonnenfeld and the tandem of Halperin and Ashkenazi. The latter two expressed feelings that were certainly shared by all the players who endeav-ored to bring these sort of manuscripts to light: “In this orphaned generation, the last of an orphan among orphans, [God] went out of His way to astonish and injected in the heart of kings, [the will] to publish mysteries of wisdom from the wisdom of truth.”107Not only were works by HaARI published anew in Jerusalem during the years in question, but a wide range of commentaries on his thought made their de-but in print.

Some of these texts are only extant in manuscript form.108Taking the form of a poem with 138 stanzas, Sefer Ma’arat Sde haMakhpela, is an abridged version of the introduction to Hayyim Vital’s Sefer Oṣrot Ḥayyim; it also features two commentaries. Attached to the beginning of this work is a poem titled Eṣ Ḥayyim beseeching the Almighty to lend a hand to anyone that delves into the kabbalah literature, particularly this book.

In fact, the latter saw his commentary on Sefer Eṣ Ḥayyim as a sort of Rashi-like exegesis on Lurianic thought. In Fetayah’s estimation, such a work had yet to emerge because most of the books on this topic are rife with sophisticated interpretations solely intended for savants:Even, all those learning [kabbalah] do not find peace of mind in the words of the commentators, for their [i.e., the commentators] entire objective is merely to reconcile those places that appear to contradict one another, such as the Tosafot. In those few places where they do explain the inten-tion of the rabbi [Luria], it is not enough for beginners. And from the days of the rabbi to the current era, we have not merited a single exegete that will interpret for us the content of this sealed book in a coherent and pithy manner like Rashi. And this reason caused, due to our many sins, the abrogation of this great commandment and the [interminable] length of this poignant and precipitous exile. In consequence, the true wisdom went missing, thrown in the corner, and not one student reaches the end of the staff in his hand so as to taste its sweet nectar.113In writing his commentary, Fetayah laid the groundwork for a more coherent understanding of the Lurianic gospel, thereby distancing himself to some extent from the intenters that followed in the RaShaSh’s footsteps.114112 Abadi, Sefer Dirvrei Mordekhai, 25b–28a.

That said, their extensive efforts to print HaARI’s works shed considerable light on the dissemination of kabbalah wisdom in Jerusalem during the early 1900s and on the importance of this corpus to the seminaries under review. The Lurianic literature was intended for Torah scholars that immersed themselves in the concealed Torah. For his part, Halperin operated within the framework of and put out the books primarily for the Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva. Nevertheless, his enterprise reverberated well beyond this institution’s walls. As is evident from the intro-ductions and approvals to these works, Halperin was in touch with scores of kabbalists around the world. The printing of the RaShaSh’s siddur and writing by Hayyim Vital catered, both in theory and in practice, to all of Jerusalem’s kabbalists. Put differently, they were all dependent on and availed themselves of these texts, which dovetailed neatly with their circles’ ideology. In 1923, Horowitz summarized his and Sha’ar haShamayim’s cumulative achievements as a success. Among the key factors behind this upbeat assessment were the aforementioned printing projects:And behold, with the help of God, to this day I have given everything I have to my enterprise concerning the holy matter of kabbalah study. I compiled works to cajole my brethren in all the places of their disper-sion to take up this sacred learning, and I established regular classes to teach this sacred wisdom to Torah scholars, geniuses, and saints, rabbis and sages – we founded the holy yeshiva of Sha’ar haShamayim for this sacred end. Blessed be God that this sacred wisdom has grown in all the circles of Torah scholars, in the Holy Land and abroad as well, by means of the holy books that we printed and distributed free of charge.115The printing enterprise in question was not only unprecedented in scope, but was animated by a conspicuous intensity of purpose. In many respects, its output heralded the printing waves during the latter half of the 1900s and the concomitant and equally determined efforts to produce commentaries and render translations of the Zoharic and Lurianic corpora as well as the RaShaSh’s works. The early twentieth-century works were essentially rejuvenated; and in the days to come would transcend the borders of Judaism. Although the dy-namics between revelation and concealment have always been the preserve of this work has triggered unprecedented interest in the Zoharian literature; Frisch, Sefer Sha’arei haZohar, 239–240.115 Horowitz, Sefer Qol Mevaser, Introduction."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"173Concealment and Revelation<UN>the kabbalah leadership, the printing initiatives in the early twentieth century brought down the barriers separating the elite from the masses. As a result, it will no longer be possible to stash away the entire corpus of Jewish mysticism in the vaults of a single yeshiva in Jerusalem’s Old City.

Their attempts to persuade traditional Jewry to embrace the Zoharic literature and attend tshuva vigils and other rituals also shed light on how the former viewed themselves. While part of the kabbalah indeed remained the sole preserve of a select few that devoted most of its time to studying this body of knowledge, some facets of this wisdom were channeled to the “profanum vulgus.” The main protagonists of this story were an insular elite that was neither bent on returning the kabbalah to its esoteric “ivory tower” nor inclined to wipe its hands clean of responsibility for the community at large. Instead, the kabbalists of Jerusalem genuinely sought to involve the average traditional Jew in deeper strata of Jewish life. Over the course of this chapter, we will focus on three aspects of this outreach: the call to study the Zohar; the dissemination of the tikkunim (rectification or, more generally, vigil) literature; and the holding of special prayer ceremonies. To begin with, though, we will take stock of another major element of the yeshi-vot’s turn to the masses – fundraising. Support for the Kabbalah Seminaries and the Turn to the General PublicThe Land-of-Israel kabbalah seminaries adopted, what was for them, unprec-edented means for disseminating Jewish esoteric wisdom and interacting with the outside world. All the yeshivot’s leaders clamored for the traditional public to return to the Zohar and take part in a mélange of tshuva vigils. However, these calls were not tantamount to unfettered exotericism. On more than one 1 Scholem, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism, 329."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"175Practicing Kabbalah<UN>occasion, it even appeared that their ultimate goal was for Jews to support full-time kabbalists and mekhavvnim. In essence, there were two dimensions to the seminaries’ outreach: the solicitation of financial support; and the dissemina-tion of various rituals and vigils that the hoi polloi were asked to perform.All of the seminaries under review promised donors a long row of won-ders and miracles. For instance, as we have already seen, Rehovot haNahar and the Emet veShalom Yeshiva made reference to various talismans, cures, and special prayers in their fundraising appeals. In 1921, the Yagdil Torah Syna-gogue and Yeshiva for Damascus Jews in Jerusalem, which had several resident kabbalists who were close to Dweck-HaKohen, offered similar services.2 Sha’ar haShamayim promised to pray on behalf of regular supporters and annually commemorate the memory of those who had passed on. Moreover, they ten-dered special prayers at holy sites and issued “membership” cards in return for largess.3 The masses were also invited to take part in the seminary’s Lag baOmer festivities: “It is a holy yoma de’hillulah [anniversary of the death] of the divine tanna Simeon bar Yochai” on which special prayers will be held by the tombs of the prophets, Sanhedrin members, and the rest of the “world’s forefathers. At the hour of the judgement’s arousal, all the sextons, members, and supporters of our yeshiva will be remembered in the prayers of saints, each person by name, in order to awaken on their behalf mercy from the source of mercy by virtue of their ardor for this holy commandment.”4 The seminary’s general ledgers indeed record expenditures on trips to Rachel’s Tomb and the Western Wall for the purpose of reciting prayers. Moreover, these sources ac-count for outlays that pertain to various requests from donors: the prepara-tion of charms and remedies; the shipment of kabbalah books, etrogs, and silk prayer shawls; and the conferral of various gifts, such as maps of the Land of Israel and calendars.5 Some of the appeals that were regularly sent to Europe and America contained talismans. “Attached to the letter of testimony,” one 2 Ma’aravi, Beit haKneset ṿeYeshivat Yagdil Tora, 10–13.3 Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva, Ḥotam Tokhnit (1912), 149; idem, Account Books, 1908–1922 (ms), vol. 1, 6.4 Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva, Invitation to the Lag baOmer Festivities (ms).5 The yeshiva’s general ledgers shed light on all these activities.

Even before Sha’ar haShamayim’s establishment, Horowitz wanted to print a book containing “marvelous segulot [talsimen or folk remedies] and cures for all sorts of ailments, heaven forbid, from sacred manuscripts,” but he did not manage to see this plan through; Horowitz, Or haMeir ṿeQol Mevaser, introduction."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"chapter 6176<UN>such request declared, “is a potent amulet [devised] in accordance to sacred writings by the greatest of the kabbalists, which must be stored like articles of holiness, and it is conducive to peace and success in his home, physical health, and longevity until the coming of Yinon [i.e., messiah] swiftly in our time amen.”6 In addition, the yeshiva sent copies of Tfilat Sha’ar haShamayim (Prayer of Sha’ar haShamayim, a compendium of prayers) to 700 addresses in Europe along with a request for support.7The notion that the general public is obligated to help the seminaries was epitomized by Sefer Yiśakhar uZevulun (Issachar and Zebulun), a book that was circulated among Jerusalem’s kabbalists in 1913.8 The anonymous author is Aharon ’Eli ha-Kohen Tawil of Allepo (ob. 1916), who reached Palestine towards the end of his life and joined the ranks of Rehovot haNahar. Moreover, there is reason to believe that he temporarily served as a resident scholar at Sha’ar haShamayim.9 The preamble well reflects the book’s content: “Words from the holy Zohar, Tikkunei Zohar, and midrashs in praise of one that reaches the stat-ure of holding the hand of those studying Torah. How great is the attribute of righteousness of those toiling on the Torah, the praise of the kabbalah wis-dom, the praises of the holy HaARI, and the praises of our mentor and rabbi, the rabbi Master Shalom Sharabi.” Sefer Yiśakhar uZevulun stands out not only for its broad call to assist the kabbalah seminaries in Jerusalem, but its plau-dits for the RaShaSh. That said, its main objective was to drum up support for Torah scholars, along the lines of Jacob the Patriarch’s son Zebulun (the rich merchant), who according to Genesis Rabbah provided for the livelihood of his brother Issachar (the sage). In this respect, the book resembled a slew of others that came out at around this time, like Sefer Shalom laAm (Shalom for the People) by the kabbalist Shalom Hedaya (who went on to head the Beit El 6 Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva, Letter, 1912 (ms).7 Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva, Account Books, 1908–1922 (ms), vol. 1, 4.8 Tawil, Sefer Yiśakhar uZevulun; reprinted in Kassin, Quntres Pri Eṣ haGan, 1–22, 51–56.9 The book’s author was revealed by Kassin in ibid, 56: “Even if it is not mentioned on the book’s cover, we nevertheless assuredly knew that he [the writer] was the rabbi and Hasid our honorable teacher and rabbi, the rabbi R. Aharon ’Eli ha-Kohen Tawil, and he was among the rabbis of Allepo. Towards the end [of his life], he established his residency in Jerusalem. [He spent] many years and [earned] adoration in the community of Hasids in the synagogue of intenters from previous generations in the days of our forefathers. Owing to his ample modesty, he did not want to mention his good name and use the title ‘author.’” For more on Tawil, see Laniado, laQedoshim asher baAReṢ, 54; Sutton, Aleppo, 345–346.

The Call to Study the Zohar and Conduct the Zemah TikkunIn contrast to the warnings and restrictions for those praying with intentions or immersing themselves in the works of HaARI and the RaShaSh, every in-dividual with a Toranic background was exhorted to study the Zohar while hewing to a simple and coherent reading of this work. It is in this spirit that Horowitz wrote his earlier, 1906 book Or haMeir ṿeQol Mevaser as well as his last one, Sanigoriya, which came out in 1940. Both works urge traditional Jews to occupy themselves with kabbalah literature, not least the Zohar, for at least one hour a day.11 In this context, Auerbach’s encomium of the translation and abridged version of the Zohar that was produced by one Yehudah Yudel Rosenberg bears notice. The latter endeavored to spread a particular facet of the Zohar among the masses. Rosenberg’s rendering comported with Sha’ar haShamayim’s exoteric objectives, the purview of which extended beyond the limited circle of kabbalah seminarians in Jerusalem.12 In this context, Horow-itz’s yeshiva planned to publish a translation of the entire Zohar, which would be targeted at readers unfamiliar with the Aramaic language in the original. For reasons unknown, this project was ultimately shelved.1310 These books are discussed in Zohar, Tradition and Change, 64–68. Shalom laAm was reprinted, along with biographic details about its author, in the early twenty-first century; Shalom laAm (2004).11 Horowitz, Or haMeir ṿeQol Mevaser; idem, Sanigoriya, 37–43. This call resurfaces in a citation of Horowitz’s words in Shrem, Sefer Sha’arei Raḥamim, 4a. A similar motive can be discerned in a call of awakening that Rehovot haNahar released back in 1904. See the end of Mishan, Sefer Sfat Emet.12 The scope may be discerned from between the lines of Shlomo Zalman Auerbach’s letter to Rosenberg in 1935: “I hereby pay thanks to him on his copying of the sacred Zohar into the holy tongue and also on his beautiful arrangement according to the portions. My father and illuminator [R. Chaim Yehuda Leib Auerbach], when he was in the us re-ceived them as a present; and whenever I read from them, they cause me great pleasure,” Auerbach, Letter to Rosenberg (ms); Robinson, “Halakha,” 46.

However, with the exception of a vocalized pocket edition of the Livorno Zohar by B. Cohen (1928)14 as well as the unabridged editions of Yehuda Leib Ashlag (1943–1953) and Reuven Margaliot (1940–1946), the city’s publishers refrained from putting out the text in its entirety throughout these decades. It is evident, then, that most kabbal-ists were availing themselves of earlier, widely-available print editions from abroad.15In early twentieth-century Jerusalem, many kabbalists urged the hoi polloi to learn a few pages of the Zohar on a daily basis. To this end, various learning groups took form. The main catalysts behind this enterprise were the sages of Rehovot haNahar and their ilk. A 1921 notice informs the Jerusalem public of the establishment of Ḥevrah Mezakeh haRabim (the Privilege the Majority Association), whose mandate was, inter alia, to spread the Zohar among tradi-tional Jews. Furthermore, it undertook to have this book studied from cover to cover 1,000 times within a single year, on the assumption that the redemption is tarrying due to neglect for the concealed Torah:All learning of the Zohar arouses mercy and the soul of the Messiah [sic]. He will be revealed and build the Temple, and the Jewish people will dwell securely. In addition, one who studies it is certain not to endure suffering from the pangs of the Messiah. For this reason, we the sages and rabbis of the holy city of Jerusalem, and [ Jewish] courts have roused up to lay the foundation for learning the Zohar in the Land and overseas for the purpose of completing the Book of Zohar. The consummation is called for the 22nd of Elul – the day of the world’s creation – may it bring us good tidings. They shall learn the Zohar and the Tikkunei Zohar a thousand times as per the secret of the thousand for you [King] Solomon [Song of Songs 8:12]. Therefore, we call upon you our brethren – sages, rabbis, merchants, householders, craftsmen – to strengthen and muster courage [in order] to take part [in this enterprise] with us. The weak shall say Brave am I and join this group, and everyone will snatch up a piece of the Zohar and write popular introductions to the kabbalah literature; Ben Hillel HaKo-hen, Atkhalta, 175.14 The publisher’s activity in the field of Jewish esoteric wisdom is discussed in Meir, “Hillel Zeitlin’s Zohar,” 150.15 For criticism of narrow socio-cultural readings on the basis of sundry local print versions, see Yudlov, “Al Sefarim,” 548."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"179Practicing Kabbalah<UN>the Zohar and learn some pages as per the arrangement given to you by the sextons.16Affixing their approvals to this communication were Yitzhak Yerucham Dis-kin, Abraham Isaac Kook, Yosef Chaim Zonnenfeld, Haim Moshe Eliashar, and Yosef Chaim HaCohen. In all likelihood, this undertaking was initiated by the sages of Rehovot haNahar; and as usual, Nissim Nahum covered the printing expenses.17 That same year, another notice of this sort was released, contain-ing new approvals from Diskin, Kook, Zonnenfeld, and Chief Rabbi Yaakov Meir.18 Mizakeh haRabim’s heads could vouch for 600 “completions” of the Zo-har. Hence, the society rushed to print out a second notice cajoling devotees to finish the remaining 400. In parallel, Yehuda Hadad (Porat Yosef Yeshiva’s spiritual guide) oversaw the formation of a similar group, Ḥevrat Rashbi (the rsby Society), whose denizens – merchants, shopkeepers, and laborers – dedicated four hours every Sabbath to studying the Zohar.19Another group, by the name of Ḥevrat Tikkun Zemah (the Zemah Tikkun Society), whose sextons included several of Rehovot haNahar’s kabbalists (Yom Tov Yedid Halevi, Aaron Harari-Raful, and Haim ben Sa’adia) reprinted Sefer Ṣemaḥ Ṣadiq in 1911.20 First published in Izmir back in 1734, new editions of this book were released throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in Salonica and Livorno. Drawing heavily on a learning arrangement put forth in Sefer Ḥemdat Yamim, this venerable work is, first and foremost, a compendium of passages from the Zoharian literature on the concept of the ṣadiq (saint or righteous person). This collection targeted the members of special reading and study groups that convened on leil shishi (the night before Friday).21 In the in-troduction to the new edition, the above-mentioned sextons heaped praise on 16 “Tikkun laGeula haAmitit,” 1921 (announcement); reprinted in Kassin, Sefer Pri Eṣ haGan, 83–85.17 It stands to reason that the catalyst behind this initiative was R.

Unlike all the previous editions, though, no trace of Sefer Ḥemdat Yamim was left on the book’s cover.22 It stands to reason that the polemics over this source a couple of years earlier is responsible for the lack of a citation. Be that as it may, Jerusalem’s kabbalists not only continued to study this controversial work, but held vigils that derive thereof. In the foreword to Ṣemaḥ Ṣadiq, the publishers referred to the duty of learning on leil shishi as per the framework established by Jacob ben Hayyim Zemah. Moreover, this cus-tom was tied to the old-new learning arrangement from Ḥemdat Yamim: “The students will consecrate themselves via and the listeners will comprehend the learning on leil shishi when everyone has already been accustomed to recite the Zemah Vigil and there [in Jacob Zemah’s Nagid u-Meẓawweh] the extent of the utility of studying early Friday morning within the framework of the tikkun brit kodesh [holy covenant vigil] is explained.”23Regardless of the template, Thursday-night learning was indeed common-place in Jerusalem.24 In around 1909, the kabbalist Yitzchak Alfiyah established a society by the name of Or Hadash ve’Zemaḥ Ṣadiq in which householders read from the Zohar on a regular basis and conducted the Zemah Vigil (tik-kun zemah) once a week.25 As Alfiyah put it, “Thank God, our plans has [sic] come to fruition and the students who learn the Righteous Zemah Tikkun [at our program] every night, especially on leil shishi have multiplied. Thanks to the exalted Lord, from then and until now, we have remained on our guard.”26 According to a 1922 pamphlet describing the activities of Sha’ar haShamayim’s resident kabbalists, they “cogitate day and night over kabbalah books and hold important tikkunim,” including “the Zemah Vigil every Thursday.”27 Alternative-ly, some leil shishi groups eschewed Sefer Ṣemaḥ Ṣadiq for sections of the Zohar 22 Various editions of Ṣemaḥ Ṣadiq are discussed in Ya’ari, “Sifrei Tiqunim,” 100, 256–258.

Shimon Zvi Horowitz put out a few pamphlets con-taining the liturgy of vigils and prayers that were held within the framework of Sha’ar haShamayim.35 Likewise, Rehovot haNahar’s sages, particularly Chaim Shaul Dweck-HaKohen and Eliyahu Yaakov Lag’imi, printed a substantial number of tikkunim that drew heavily on the output of HaARI and the Ra-ShaSh.36 The most notable vigils were tikkun karet (the Excision Vigil), special rectifications for the first day of a new month, Lag baOmer, and the Festival of Weeks, tikkun ḥaṣot (the Midnight Vigil/Prayers), tikkun ha’brit (the Covenant 33 Guedj, Sefer KeGAN haYaraq.

A full description of the era’s popular tikkunim is beyond the scope of this book. However, we will expand on several of those that shed light on the prevailing atmosphere at Jerusalem’s kabbalah circles.37One of Jerusalem’s best attended tikkunim was the Midnight Vigil. The various arrangements of this ceremony were printed, above all, by the city’s kabbalists.38 Zvi Meroni testified in 1938 that on a daily basis, some 500 kab-balists conducted the tikkun ḥaṣot in Jerusalem – a figure that does not cover those held by Hasids and others. Furthermore, Meroni provided a romantic description of Midnight Vigils that he observed on a tour that he gave of the Old City. In the process, he breaks down the tikkun’s various parts and cites at length from a conversation he had with an elder kabbalist.39 Correspondingly, a few local novelists penned descriptions of these ceremonies in Jerusalem. For instance, a “miraculous tale” that Asher Ben-Israel heard from “the elders of the Sephardim” in 1913 revolves around a tikkun that was presided over by the RaShaSh at the Western Wall.40 The Midnight Vigil is also the subject of one of Israel Zarchi’s fictional works about local Bratslav Hasids.41 “Different are the ways,” he wrote, “that lead to the tikkun prayer and different are the venues of the tikkun, but one are the intentions of the heart that seek to draw the redemption closer. In the corner of ancient houses of worship and in inner rooms, in public, and a niche within a niche, each person according to his litur-gical style, each person according to his siddur, everyone rectifies themselves with the rectification of midnight.”42Tikkun ḥaṣot was undoubtedly a major practice, especially among Jerusa-lem’s kabbalists. For instance, societies were established to conduct these vigils 37 On the origins and meaning of the tikkunim literature, see Fine, Physician of the Soul, 187–258; Nabarro, Tikkun.38 For more on the meaning and provenance of tikkun ḥaṣot, see Scholem, On the Kabbalah and its Symbolism, 146–150; Nabarro, Tikkun, 85–87, 93–97; Giller, Shalom Shar’abi, 140–141; Idel, Messianic Mystics, 308–320; Magid, “Conjugal Union,” xvii–xlv; Zohar, Sephardic and Mizrahi Jewry, 204–205; Faierstein, Jewish Customs of Kabbalistic Origin, 91–93.

From the end of the nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century, numerous editions came out in Baghdad, Livorno, Allepo, Tunis, Djerba, and various places in East Europe, thereby attesting to the wide scope of this custom. Our chief concern is in the arrangements of this vigil used by Jerusalem’s kabbalists and several editions that they brought to press.One of the most commonplace versions of the Midnight Vigil was arranged by R. Nissim Harari and first published in Jerusalem circa 1878. The book was subsequently printed a few times in Allepo and Jerusalem, but the most inter-esting came out in the latter city some three years before the turn of the cen-tury. Comprising hundreds of pages, this edition was printed with the support of Beit El’s sages.43 Reedited by Yehoshua Tzvi Michal Shapira, a resident kab-balist at the venerable yeshiva, the work includes a sizable commentary.44 In an approval by Jacob Saul Elyashar, mention is made of Beit El’s kabbalists and the Ḥevrat Shomrim laBoker (the Society of Guards for the Morning), which they founded for the purpose of studying and conducting the Midnight Vigil. Most of the known members of this fellowship were part of the nucleus of kab-balists that subsequently founded the Rehovot haNahar Yeshiva: Dweck-Ha-Kohen, Yom Tov Yedid Halevi, Ezra Harari-Raful, Eliezer Mizrahi, Isaac Shrem, and Avraham Azriel. From the introduction of this edition, it is clear that this arrangement was not merely intended for a select few:We the [spiritual] guides and managers of Ḥevrat Shomrim laBoker [are] noticing that our brethren the Jewish people are overburdened with their affairs of making a living by fault of their sin of being plebeians. Their basic foodstuffs are steadily dwindling and are as difficult [to attain] as crossing the Sea of Reeds. One rises early to set out on his way and the other to open his shop in order to see from where his aid will come. Hence, free time does not agree with them [so they are hard-pressed] to set aside regular intervals for Torah. To this end, we have arisen and have motivated ourselves to prod the hearts of our brethren the Jewish people to make this association for the purpose of setting aside [time] for learn-ing from midnight until the day shines through and gathering them to the 43 Seder Tiqun Ḥaṣot (1897). Dablitski compiled an expanded second edition; Seder Tiqun Ḥaṣot, vols. 1–2 (1972). Beit El’s Midnight Vigil customs are discussed in Afg’in, Sefer Divrei Shalom, vol. 1, 33–74.44 For a look at Shapira, see Gepner, Midrasho shel Shem, 230–231.

For the sake of sparking the students’ desire, we have endeavored with all our might to bring text books and [works of ] Mai-monides, the Shulḥan Arukh, the Zohar, Mishnas, and Psalms so that ev-eryone will be able to set his [course of ] studies in what his heart desires. Moreover, God in heaven will beneficently see to it, in an hour of grace, that students’ hearts are aroused. Their hearts will be open like the door of an auditorium to merit the Torah’s crown; each person is tested accord-ing to his praise – one achieving more, one doing less. All [we ask is] that he direct his heart to the heaven to give satisfaction to our Creator, to lift up the skhinah from the dust.45Thereafter, the introduction’s author gives thanks to those who foot the bill for candles and “heat coffee and sugar to make things comfortable for the attendees.”A couple of other fellowships of this sort were established in Jerusalem. Moreover, the vigils were conducted on an individual basis as well. Each group had its own version of the tikkunim and suitable learning arrangements. For instance, Sha’ar haShamayim’s 1925 program depicts the yeshiva’s own framework:A minyan [quorum] of mekhavvnim is alternately chosen each and ev-ery week. During this time, they remain within the walls of the yeshiva’s court, live a life of asceticism and solitariness, and are occupied with To-rah and worship. Three times a day, these mekhavvnim, who are called “Anshei Mishmar uMa’amad,” recite their prayers in accordance to the siddur of our rabbi, Shalom Sharabi of blessed memory. At midnight, they get up, dip themselves in a kosher mikveh, conduct the Midnight Vigil with intentions and yiḥudim and mortify [themselves] over the dis-tress of the skhinah’s exile and the exile of the Jewish people. In addition, they recite special prayers with utmost fervor and devotion for the Jewish people’s redemption and the coming of the Messiah our savior swiftly in our day amen.46From this account, it is evident that a distinction was made between the tik-kunei ḥaṣot that were popular among traditional Jews (be it alone or en masse) and special Sharabian versions that were held exclusively by a quorum of mekhavvnim within the yeshiva’s gates. This distinction aside, the kabbalists 45 Seder Tiqun Ḥaṣot (1897), document in the beginning of the book.46 Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva, Ḥotam Tokhnit (1925), 10."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"chapter 6186<UN>urged the masses to conduct the vigil. Among the texts from this corpus that Horowitz disseminated was “Seder Tikkun ḥaṣot,” which is intended for lay Jews.47 Similarly, the co-rosh yeshiva presided over “a general pidyon shvuyim [ ransoming of captives]” for the greater Jewish community. Requiring a quorum of worshippers, this ceremony consisted of “an annulment of vows, the pledge of the Exile, and abrogating evil decrees from all our brethren from the House of Israel in all the lands of their dispersion.”48 The Sha’ar haShamay-im Yeshiva also held Midnight Vigils at the Western Wall. Year later, Auerbach recounted that during Abraham Isaac Kook’s first years in Jerusalem, the chief rabbi “participated without fanfare in Sha’ar haShamayim’s tikkun ḥaṣot next to the [ Wailing] Wall for about two hours.”49Rehovot haNahar printed the RaShaSh’s version of the tikkun ḥaṣot, copies of which were widespread in Jerusalem.50 The tikkun was often affixed to siddurs or pamphlets containing Zoharian literature. Furthermore, tens of booklets providing certain parts of the Vigil. as well as pertinent halakhas, explanations, and comments, were distributed to the hoi polloi.51 In 1916, “an arrangement of the tikkun ḥaṣot,” along with various kavvamot of Hayyim Vital and others, was brought to press in Nah-Amon (Alexandria). Once again, it appears that Jerusalem’s kabbalists and their confidantes were involved in this endeavor.52In 1925, the kabbalist Yeshaya Asher Zelig Margaliot, with the support of Rehovot haNahar’s sages, printed a booklet, Qumi Roni, comprising an arrange-ment of the Midnight Vigil as well as introductions and explanations.53 Ac-cording to Margaliot, this publication was possible thanks to the assistance of a sexton from Ḥevrat Leil Shishi (the Friday Night Society) – an organization that he also belonged to. In an expanded edition of Qumi Roni, which came out in 1959, Margaliot noted that “Here in the holy city of Jerusalem, it is a custom of many people, Torah scholars and kabbalists, to wear sackcloth and [put] dust on their head while saying the tikkun ḥaṣot. I indeed saw my teacher and rabbi, the divine holy genius Rabbi Chaim Shaul Dweck-HaKohen and his holy colleagues” donning “sacks while reciting the Midnight Vigil.”54 It also bears 47 Horowitz, Sanigoriya, 28–36.48 Horowitz, Seder Pidyon Shvuim haKlali.49 Zvi Yehuda Kook, LiShlosha beElul, vol. 1, 31.50 Dweck-HaKohen and Lag'imi, Sefer Benayahu ben Yehoyada, vol. 2, 3b–16a.51 See, for example, Hadrat Zkainim: Idra Raba veIdra Zuta/Seder Tiqun Ḥaṣot (1913).52 Seder Tiqun Ḥaṣot (1916).53 Margaliot, Sefer Qumi Roni (1925).54 Margaliot, Sefer Qumi Roni (1959), 26a.

And thank God that I established Ḥevrat Leil Shishi [the Friday Night Society] at the synagogue of Leibeleh Sachatashoevsk, here in the holy city of Jerusa-lem in [the neighborhood of ] Beit Yisrael where every leil shishi my holy comrades gather and learn until midnight and [then] recite tikkun ḥaṣot in a sackcloth and ashes as per the arrangement of HaARI, whereupon they recite Psalms until the light of morning and pray on behalf of all our brethren the Jewish people wherever they may be.56The 1921 guidelines of the Yagdil Torah Synagogue and Yeshiva, whose mem-bers included several of Dweck-HaKohen’s disciples (e.g., Yaakov Munseh and Eliyahu Ma’aravi), make note of similar practices: “Every day, the Torah schol-ars get up at midnight precisely when the clock strikes twelve [sic] and read the Midnight Vigil en masse. Afterwards, they learn until the morning from the words of our rabbi HaARI.”57These testimonies attest to the magnitude of this rite in Jerusalem as well as the pursuits of the city’s kabbalists. By printing material on and organizing appropriate frameworks for the Midnight Vigils, they ratcheted up its popular-ity within the community. As we have seen, all members of traditional Jewish society were obliged to perform this tikkun. However, the leading kabbalists distinguished between the Sharabian version, which was limited to members of their inner circle, and a more basic configuration for the masses. The groups adopted this custom; AZaMeR beShavkhin, 138–140. For more on these practices, see Dweck-HaKohen and Lag'imi, Sefer Benayahu ben Yehoyada, vol. 2, 4b–55b (according to Sha’ar Ruaḥ haQodesh).55 Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva, Account Books, 1908–1922 (ms), vol. 1, 120.56 Margaliot, Sefer Qumi Roni (1925), Introduction.

On the other hand, some of the other vigils cemented the bonds between kabbalists and the greater community, as the seminaries became the primary venue for these services. A case in point is the yemei ha’shovavim vigils. Tikkun ha’Brit, Bratslav Hasidism and Yemei ha’ShovavimIn disseminating the vigil literature among traditional society, Jerusalem’s kabbalists put a special emphasis on the pidyon nefesh and vigils during yemei ha’shovavim-tat (depending on whether it is a leap year, the six to eight weeks from the portion of Shemot to the portion of Teṣaveh in the Book of Exodus) – a ritual that is connected to the aforementioned tikkun ha’brit. Deriving from ancient sources, these customs merited renewed attention in the Lurianic discourse and various innovations in the tikkunim literature, to which they belong. The defining elements of yemei ha’shovavim are tikkunei tshuva, atten-dant learning arrangements, and the requirement of observing 84 fasts.58 In early twentieth-century Jerusalem, a flurry of preparations could be felt during this period. For instance, many tikkunim books were printed in the run-up to these six weeks. Although various texts of this sort came out in previous gener-ations, a resurgence of this custom was apparently underway in the city during the years under review. A unique aspect of the era’s yemei ha’shovavim was the collaboration between Ashkenazim and Sephardim and the occasional fusion 58 For a disquisition on the ha’shovavim vigils and its expansive literature, see Scholem, Pirqei Yesod, 151; Cohen, Sources and History, 107–129; Hallamish, Kabbalah in Liturgy, 567–594; Scholem, Sabbatai Sevi, 290–297, 936–939; Fine, Physician of the Soul, 179, 408–409; Wein-stein, Kabbalah and Jewish Modernity, 8–9, 422, 474; Idel, “The Tsadik,” 215–216: “The above passage describes a practice that has been established since the late sixteenth century and is known as the Tikun shovavim, the ascetic practice of repentance during Mondays and Thursdays of some weeks during winter. This practice was disseminated in larger audiences, especially by the popular book of kabbalistic ethics of Lurianic extraction but written in Sabbatean circles, titled Hemdat yamim; it is still in vogue in some circles of Orthodox Jews today. Though the term shovavim is actually an acronym for the initial let-ters of the weekly pericopes of those weeks, the name also has something to do with the struggle with the inclination. Already in the Babylonian Talmud the term shovav is inter-preted as ‘he turned his inclination aside.’ Thus, the externalization of the sexual sins that was generated by kabbalistic speculations starting with the book of the Zohar created a new ritual intended to counteract those personal enemies.” Yehoshua describes this time of year in Jerusalem; idem, “Fortune Tellers and Soothsayers,” 237–238."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"189Practicing Kabbalah<UN>between the RaShaSh’s prayer intentions and Hasidic practices. What is more, attempts were made to transform this practice into a series of extensive pub-lic and civic ceremonies in which the host seminary and individual kabbalist leading a service would assume center stage.The RaShaSh himself established special kavvanot for the Midnight Vigil, which were integrated into a couple works, most notably Emet leYaʻaqov by Jacob Shaltiel Ninio (Livorno, 1843).59 Following in Sharabi’s footsteps, kabbalists gleaned rectifications and special prayers from earlier books to pro-duce new arrangements for this service. Tikkunim booklets, which consisted primarily of rectifications and prayers for sexual transgressions, became popu-lar over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Some of these rituals were meant to be performed by the individual after a misdeed, while others were designated for particular days, like yemei ha’shovavim.60 Among the more influential works of this sort that came out during the second half of the 1800s was the pamphlet Seder haYom (Baghdad, 1870); the book Refuat haNefesh (Babylon, 1870); Lashon Ḥakhamim ( Jerusalem, 1905–1910) by Yosef Hayyim; and Kranot Ṣadik by Eliyahu Suliman Mani (Baghdad, 1867). Over the years, these same texts were incorporated into new books that were printed in Jerusalem.61As Pinchas Giller noted: “The rectification of sexual sins was an important part of the atonement process for the Beit El [i.e., Sharabian] kabbalists.”62 Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the Bratslaver tikkun ha’klali (General Remedy) seized the limelight in the religious experience of Sharabi’s Jerusa-lem-based adherents. They adopted R. Nahman of Bratslav’s version of the tik-kun ha’brit as well as many dictums from the rebbe’s books – this at an hour in which Bratslav Hasidism had yet to catch on in the Ashkenazic world. From the mid-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century, R. Nahman’s tikkun ha’klali was 59 Gepner offers a portrait of this figure; see Midrasho shel Shem, 230.

In Jerusalem, the vigil netted six editions during the early 1900s. These works were brought to press by the city’s small Bratslav community, whose members had a direct influence on their neighboring kabbalists. Oddly enough, their sway was not necessarily bound by geographic propinquity. As early as the 1850s, several Bratslav works were copied in Baghdad and the sect’s practices were evidently integrated into the writing of Sephardic kabbalists even at this early stage.63In collections on tikkun ha’brit that were assembled by Jerusalem’s kabbalists, we find a synthesis between Bratslav thought and versions of tikkun ha’klali, on the one hand, and vigils of the RaShaSh, Yosef Hayyim, and Eliyahu Suliman Mani, on the other. Examples include Ben-Zion Mordechai Hazan’s Sefer Tiqun haKlali (1903), which the author described as a compilation of “various rec-tifications for the sin of masturbation and wasted seed,” and a similar book, Sama deḤayay (1923), by Eliyahu Moshe Ma’aravi.64 Affixed to Yosef Hartman’s third edition of Mani’s Qarnot Ṣadiq (1904) – a book on various tikkunim for the “damage to the bond” – was R. Nahman’s tikkun ha’klali.65The above-noted unique and expansive activities, especially public vigils, that were held during yemei ha’shovavim imparted Jerusalem with a special flavor. In 1912, Eliezer Ben-Yehuda’s newspaper HaOr reported on the feverish preparations at this time of year:Yemei ha’shovavim. – In the beginning of last week, the Jerusalemite kabbalists started to fast and abstain from pleasures via the shovavim mortifications, which according to the Torah of kabbalah is a great recti-fication for the sin of masturbation. The big promoter promoting this is the Lord Nissim Nahum. It has come to our attention that Lord Nahum managed to establish a large society to this end, the number of whose members has risen to a hundred men. During the first week, more than forty “householders” fasted each day. Even among the Ashkenazim, there 63 See Benayahu, Hebrew Books, 215.

Isaac Eliezer Harlap.66This news item was a stepping stone for a blistering attack against Sha’ar haShamayim’s shovavim vigils and fasts in one of the ensuing issues of HaOr (further criticism in the Ben-Yehuda family’s papers is discussed in the next chapter). The author of this piece, which appeared under the innocuous title “Among Jerusalem’s Affairs,” went by the pseudonym A. Sulami. Following a description of the notices that Sha’ar haShamayim circulated to promote its activities, he reproached “those that mortify themselves during yemei ha’shovavim” and described the changes to this rite over the years:The readers may recall that in one of the previous issues, we informed [them] of those mortifying themselves during yemei ha’shovavim (in ac-ronyms it is: Shemot, Va’eira, Bo, Beshalaḥ, Yitro, and Mishpatim and in a leap year they also continue to mortify themselves in tat: Terumah and Teṣaveh). During these same days they fast, immerse their bodies in cold water, and the like, and the most dedicated Hasids also take breaks [from eating] and roll in the snow while naked. The secret of mortification and cessation stems from the kabbalah, as is noted: to rectify the mischievous soul that was defiled by the sin of masturbation, God forbid, “for obvi-ously there is no person in the world that is unblemished by this sin.” Therefore, during the days of these [Torah] portions, the evil inclination is in the ascendancy, heaven forbid, on an equal footing with the exile to Egypt – the proprietors of the kabbalah issued the decree to mortify one-self and fast during these days in particular and to get up on Monday and Thursday of these same weeks and recite selichot [penitential poems] and prayers during the [early] morning watches. This is according to the kabbalah. However, the true moralists object to this method, and they say that it is completely forbidden to mortify oneself and fast.... How-ever, the practitioners of the kabbalah do not heed the sages’ words and do everything according to their opinion and delusion, as [it is] for this reason that they are possessors of the kabbalah. And many years ago, “the select few” from the different ethnic groups in our city and from those that [recently] entered “the kabbalah” would customarily mortify them-selves during these days, concentrate intentions, intertwine names of God, etc. all in the way of the kabbalah. However, [back] then, they would do all this modestly, sub rosa; one of the members would go on duty and 66 Ben Avi, “Yemei haShovavim,” 3."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"chapter 6192<UN> circle the others, and one by one they would enter the designated place, at times by “the Western Wall,” and they would say the selichot and the prayers, and no one knew about this. Nearly all the original [members of the] “select few” have died and in their place have come others – midgets, men who “installed the unclean into the fear [of God].” This entire matter is solely a matter of money.67The epithet of “midgets” indeed refers to the heads of the Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva (along with all the newfangled promoters of yemei ha’shovavim) who, in A. Sulami’s estimation, are entirely motivated by lucre. He attributed the growth and extroverted nature of this activity to the slippage of his genera-tion’s kabbalists, not that he was especially fond of their predecessors. At any rate, the author duly captured the changes that had transpired to the custom at hand. Yemei ha’shovavim was no longer the sole preserve of individuals or small groups, but a major outreach effort on the part of the seminaries, which reaped a windfall of donations from the laymen attending their events.A year before this article came out, Dweck-HaKohen and Eliyahu Lag’imi printed the opening part of a collection of Sharabian tikkunim under the head-ing Sefer Benayahu ben Yehoyada. This book also includes shovavim vigils, some of which came out earlier in Sha’ar Ruaḥ haQodesh and Ninio’s and Sefer Emet leYa’aqov.68 Accompanying Benayahu ben Yehoyada, which was widely distributed in Jerusalem, are lengthy approvals from Shlomo Elyashiv, Mena-hem Menkhin Halperin, Yosef Chaim Zonnenfeld, and other rabbis. The book itself opens with the words “It is known how there is no righteous person in the Land who will do good and will not sin as well, in this incarnation or other incarnations. Rectifications must be done for the sins in order to raise up the sparks of holiness that have fallen.” In the introduction, there is a description of the chain of events that led to the arrangement of the tikkunim: “Given the fact that our rabbi HaARI, compiled a set of rectifications for iniquities that make a number of fasts according to the tikkun covering each sin. In this gener-ation, infirmity has descended on the world and not every person has the good fortune of observing a number of fasts as [per] what was established by our rabbi HaARI.” For this reason, the kabbalah circles turned to a new enterprise – publishing collections of these works.69 The publishers also took it upon them-selves to refurbish their editions, vis-à-vis the earlier ones by Yosef Hayyim. 67 Sulami, “MeInyanei Yerushalayim,” 3.

Besides containing Sharabian vigils, it unfurls the liturgy of fast days and pidyon nefesh ceremonies for certain sins, including those that are emphasized in the tikkunim literature for yemei ha’shovavim:Behold, we have found and seen that the brilliant rabbi the famed genius [and] rabbi, the sage, our rabbi, Yosef Hayyim, a righteous and saintly person of blessed memory, a rabbi from Babylon, in his book Lashon Ḥakhamim, Part I, from page 118 to page 160 made a suitable arrange-ment for rectifications of the sins to relieve the person who did not store [enough] energy to fast all the number of fasts, namely he should fast one day and all the rest of the fasts he can discharge by giving [dona-tions] in return for each day of that same tikkun he is occupied with.... He [Hayyim] also set the order of learning, the fast days, [and other] matters that pertain to the rectification of that sin. Everyone will be able to do the above-mentioned tikkun because given the fact that the said rabbi, a great kabbalist, in his marvelous wisdom included and arranged secrets and mysteries of tikkunim, yiḥudim, and prayers which belong to that same vigil and donned them with verses and prayers, so that even the simpletons will be able to do them, for all of them are constructed in accordance with the words of HaARI.70While the compilers indeed praised the Yosef Hayyim edition that came out a short while earlier, their objective was to assemble a collection of tikkunim that is based on Lurianic and Sharabian thought. To this end, they apparently vet-ted the collection into a dual-purpose tool: on the one hand, a work outfitted with full prayer intentions, which was slated for the new wave of mekhavvnim; and on the other hand, a guide for those seeking to absolve themselves of the fasts by observing the RaShaSh’s vigils within the framework of the kabbalah seminaries. Here is their description of the two options:However, those entering God’s secret and seeking to act in accordance to the collection of prayers that our rabbi the RaShaSh, may his virtue pro-tect us, arranged as per the order of HaARI, and given [the fact] that the said prayer arrangements of our rabbi the RaShaSh are only to be found in the possession of certain extraordinary individuals and many yearn for them [i.e., these texts] and they are not within their reach, with this in mind we have copied them from appropriate siddurs of kavvanot that 70 Idem, 1a–4a."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"chapter 6194<UN>are in our possession. We also wanted to make them for one that does not store energy to fast and wants to absolve himself of his fasts. With this in mind, we made a mark in this issue like this * and below we wrote a ver-sion that pertains to one who discharges his fast [sic].71In light of the above, the shovavim vigils are indeed showcased in this book, as they take up several pages, replete with prayer intentions. A case in point is the RaShaSh’s version of the prayer Aneinu (Answer Us), which was held in Re-hovot haNahar and other Jerusalem kabbalah seminaries during this period.72Even if HaOr’s invective was not targeted at these specific customs, Benaya-hu ben Yehoyada certainly epitomized the desire to spread tikkunim that were extracted from manuscripts among the traditional masses – a trend that was prevalent among all Jerusalem’s kabbalists, regardless of ethnic background. For instance, the vigils in Dweck-HaKohen and Lag’imi’s book were immediate-ly reprinted in scores of booklets (some of which included revisions and sup-plements), like Rehovot haNahar’s 1914 pamphlet Shem miShemen. Needless to say, these publications exposed the vigils to an even wider audience.The tikkunim literature was grounded on the realization that even though HaARI had “commanded” the Jewish people to observe 84 fasts, the majority were incapable of abiding by the letter of this law. In consequence, different alternatives were created, including the option of substituting the fasts with charity. There was also flexibility with respect to the versions of the tikkunim, as the public could adopt either Yosef Hayyim or the RaShaSh’s arrangements. For their part, the kabbalah seminaries took the initiative of coordinating the prayer schedule on yemei ha’shovavim and disseminating the texts.In 1935, this same Sharabian vigil was reprinted in the book Tiqun haYesod by the Hasid R. Noah Gad Weintraub. The compiler leaned on the previous edition of Dweck-HaKohen; and ryaz Margaliot helped him with the type-setting.73 According to Weintraub, he launched this project because copies of Benayahu ben Yehoyada had run out. Moreover, he was motivated by “the 71 Ibid, 1a–b. Most of the manuscripts of the RaShaSh’s siddur that we are privy to were cop-ied by R. Nissim Harari, the author of Alei Nahar. Of course, the vigils’ compilers preferred devotees who fully observed the fasts. The latter were also entreated to study the sources of the tikkunim as presented in Sha’ar Ruaḥ haQodesh, Nahar Shalom, and other pertinent works.72 Dweck-HaKohen and Lag'imi, Sefer Benayahu ben Yehoyada, vol 1, 6a–15a, 75a–76a.73 Weintraub, Quntres Tiqun haYesod. Moskowitz refers to Margaliot’s assistance; ibid, 3. In 1924, Noah Gad Weintraub arrived from Poland to Palestine. This figure printed several kabbalah books that were largely unknown to the general public, among them Sefer Zrubavel veNevuat Yeled (1938).

In this generation in which a weakness has fallen upon the world it impossible for each person to fast the number of all these fasts that must be fasted. Therefore, the sages among the kabbalists have arranged, as is written in the introduction of the said b[ook] Benaiah, and as is thus done in Jerusalem, to nevertheless fast one day in every week of the shovavim weeks (in a leap year, tat as well). Here in the holy city, there are perma-nent and known synagogues, study halls, and seminaries of Sephardim and Ashkenazim that have allocated compartments [for these prayers]. All those who fast assemble on that same day to pray the Afternoon Prayer [mincha] there, whereupon they absolve themselves of the 84 fasts with a monetary pidyon of five pounds, which is the monetary value of the pidyon of 84 feasts. And the poorest do the pidyon [by] giving 3 half-shekels on Purim. Before the pidyon, they recite the Modim [We Thank] Prayer that is printed here at the outset [of ] the book; and afterwards, in the Afternoon Prayer, they say the blessing shomai’ah tefilah [who listens to prayer], the unabridged Aneinu Prayer with the [RaShaSh’s] yiḥudim that is [sic] printed here.74Put differently, the tikkun is not solely intended for the handful of intenter-kabbalists. Moreover, substitutes were instituted for those incapable of either preforming the sophisticated prayer intentions or enduring the bevy of fasts:On the son’s relationship with Dweck-HaKohen and the meetings between them, see Be-Yeshishim Ḥokhma, 143–144.74 Weintraub, Quntres Tiqun haYesod, “Several Words from the Publisher.”"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"chapter 6196<UN>One that does not enter the secret of God and has no hand in the wis-dom of kabbalah will say during the whispered prayer [i.e., the Silent Amidah], in shomai’ah tefilah, the abridged Aneinu which is printed here and has been arranged especially for the shovavim. Afterwards, he will hear during the repetition of the shliach tzibur [i.e., the service leader] (which is arranged each and every day at a permanent venue for the Af-ternoon Prayer of shovavim [and led by] a permanent and known shl-iach tzibur – one of the kabbalists’ sages, who says during the prayer’s repetition) the unabridged Aneinu Prayer with the intentions and the yiḥudim and intends to exempt the congregation of listeners, and with the monetary pidyon of the 84 days and the unabridged Aneinu Prayer (whether he [i.e., the average Jew] himself knows how to say [it] or hears [it] from the shliach tzibur). [In so doing,] it is considered as though he fasted 84 days.75According to Weintraub, one can also participate in a vigil without physically attending the service: “Even those far from Jerusalem can join with the said holy communities and send his [sic] name and money for the redemption of his soul to the permanent places noted above each and every day via his ac-quaintances in Jerusalem. He [i.e., the shliach tzibur] will pray in his stead.”76 As such, people outside of Jerusalem also leaned on the city’s yeshivot. The strenuous rectifications and long fasts were replaced with general vigils, which were administered by several kabbalists. Although this idea of substituting fasts with monetary contributions was frowned upon by some kabbalists in Je-rusalem and beyond, it appears that the custom was widespread and had many advocates.77 Among its fiercest supporters were R. Yosef Hayyim of Baghdad and the sages of Rehovot haNahar and Sha’ar haShamayim.78 However, there are vast differences between these and the earlier allowances, as Jerusalem’s 75 Ibid.76 Ibid.77 According to ryaz Margaliot, Dweck-HaKohen expressed discomfort with the practice of substituting a fast with a pidyon; Moskowitz, Seder Shovavim, 36; idem, Oṣar haSipurim, vol. 3, 28. However, this testimony runs counter to Dweck-HaKohen’s own words in the beginning of the first volume of Benayahu ben Yehoyada as well as the accounts of his other disciples. See, for instance, the next footnote.78 The prevalent view on this topic was put into writing by one of Dweck-HaKohen’s students, Eliyahu Moshe Ma’aravi: “We have found from among the first and last [ adjudicators] that a man can fast a certain number of days for the sin of spilling seed in vain and absolve him-self of the rest of the days with money;” Ma’aravi, Sefer Sama deḤayay, vol. 2, 19b.

According to the seminary’s financial records, every year it cir-culated announcements that pertain to yemei ha’shovavim. Moreover, a feast was thrown for the yeshiva’s inner core at the end of this period.79 It is no won-der, then, that HaOr’s inflammatory article on Sha’ar haShamayim highlighted these activities. The paper’s accusation that the primary reason behind the gen-esis of the shovavim vigils was “to give publicity to” the seminary’s “business in order that the money would start flowing into their pocket” managed to enrage its community. Soon after the article was published, an anonymous notice was circulated in Jerusalem under the heading “On the Matter of shovavim and tat. Signed by “N. one of the anchorites,” the pugnacious statement was clearly penned by someone close to the yeshiva.80 The author(s) was not above tak-ing personal shots at Ben-Yehuda and his family. For instance, he claims that the secular ideologue and his kin were supported by Christian missionaries and that they hold a “merry feast” every Yom Kippur. In any event, the com-munication was largely aimed at defending the shovavim vigils. Besides quot-ing from Sefer Ṣa’aqat Bnei Yisrael, Hitorerut haTshuva ṿeSliḥot ṿeTfilot (1911),81 the writer informs his readers that there is no need to get all worked up about “the buffoonery of Ben-Yehuda and his friends for what can these worms that creep, crawl, and rummage through the garbage do to hurt you? Who is moved by their words?” This diatribe is perhaps the lone existing reaction of Sha’ar ha-Shamayim’s habitués (or at least one of their confidantes) to the criticism that was hurled at them from outside the borders of the Old Yishuv. Regardless of the author’s identity, the statement demonstrates that the yeshiva’s supporters were none too pleased with such charges of quackery.Needless to say, the slap on the face from HaOr did not alter the kabbal-ists’ path. Books containing shovavim vigils netted scores of different editions length in the responsa of Yosef Hayyim who, unlike Yehuda Fetayah, permitted this indul-gence. See Yosef Hayyim, Emunt Itecha, 63–68; Hillel Takanat haShavim, 96–108.79 See, for example, the institution’s expenses for the 1913 year; Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva, Account Books, 1908–1922 (ms), vol. 1, 97.80 “BiDvar Shovavim,” 1912 (announcement).

An illustrative example is one of the aforementioned Shem miShemen, which came out in 1914. It includes two “tikkunim that are useful for fixing the known defect, none other than the shovavim fast and the bed-time Kriyat Sh’ma.” This book came out “with the permission of the kabbalists’ supreme Hasids of the holy city of Jerusalem, of the holy community of Rehov-ot haNahar, for the public’s benefit to arouse a listening ear, to call everyone’s attention [to the need] of rectifying their soul, spirit, and essence.”82 In the book’s introduction, there is a detailed explanation of yemei ha’shovavim and the evolution of the tikkunim as well as citations from Benayahu ben Yehoyada. After commending Yosef Hayyim on his vigils, the writers noted that the Iraqi rabbi’s successors have “instituted a great and awe-inspiring matter, that is to fast and convene assemblies in synagogues and study halls every single day during these yemei ha’shovavim-tat.”83As far as can be seen, these rectifications also had an effect on Aharon Roth – the founder of the Hasidic court Shomer Emunim, who was often unsettled by the tikkun ha’brit service. The rebbe was well-acquainted with Jerusalem’s kabbalists. His first book, which came out in Satmar in 1933, merited a lengthy approval from Dweck-HaKohen, who he had met in Jerusalem. The approval includes plaudits for Roth as well as his Hasids residing in the holy city.84 After reading Benayahu ben Yehoyada a few months later, Roth wrote a letter to ryaz Margaliot informing the latter that he would like to print a work containing tikkun ha’yesod and the RaShaSh’s Aneinu, even though these rectifications hardly aligned with his worldview. To this end, he asked Margaliot to send him the version that Weintraub had published.85 Two years later, Roth printed a book that is grounded on tikkun ha’yesod and largely consists of prayers he 82 Shem miShemen, 1a.83 Idem, 9b.

In 1922, an appeal titled “Shuvu Banim beYemei Shovavim Tat,” made the rounds. This notice called on devotees to fast and take part in pidyon nefesh ceremonies at a couple of synagogues and yeshivot, like Sha’ar haShamayim. Signing off on the communication was Ḥevrah Mizakeh haRabim, which was also responsible for a couple of other statements along these lines. Moreover, it appears that Nissim Nahum, who helped print the no-tices exhorting the flock to read through the Zohar on an annual basis, was involved in this endeavor as well.87 According to one eyewitness, “For many years [Nahum] printed announcements [concerning] the arrangement of the shovavim vigils in their season and gratuitously distributed them in the Land and throughout the cities of the Diaspora in order to benefit the public.”88 That same year, Sha’ar haShamayim disseminated a couple of flyers about its resident kabbalists. One of them noted that these figures conduct huge vigils. “ Especially on yemei ha’shovavim, they take to fasting and perform a pidyon nefesh by means of a vigil of the 84 fasts and tikkun ha’yesod.”89During this time of year, Yitzchak Alfiyah clamored for speech moratoriums within the framework of the aforementioned group Ohr Samai’aḥ ve’Zemaḥ Ṣadik.

Above all, Munseh invited the public to take part in special Sharabian prayers at the Emet veShalom Yeshiva during yemei ha’shovavim.93In 1924, Eliyahu Moshe Ma’aravi, among the sages of Rehovot haNahar, re-printed the content of several ethical pamphlets and information on “this dan-gerous ailment, that is the defect of the bond,” in Sama deḤayay. The second part of this thick tome contains full excerpts from Eliyahu Suliman Mani’s Sefer Qarnot Ṣadiq and letters by Yosef Hayyim. Furthermore, Ma’aravi made reference to the Vilna Gaon, copied R. Nahman of Bratslav’s tikkun ha’klali and Elimelech of Lizhensk’s Ṣetel Katan, and suggested a handful of other vigils for yemei ha’shovavim. He also harped on the need to bolster these vigils. While emphasizing the importance of the 84 fasts, he mentioned the possibility of releasing themselves from this duty with cash donations. In the process, he de-scribed the evolution of Jerusalem’s tikkun customs, which combine activities involving the greater public with those reserved for “the select few.” Aside for this mélange of suggestions and excerpts, Ma’aravi also provided the following introduction:Given the fact that this sin [i.e., masturbation] is very grave, how good and how pleasant it would be if individuals whose hearts are beset by a dearth of fear of God were to convene for a rectification of their soul at a prayer house on a fast day for [sic] the Afternoon Prayer.

It behooves the kabbalists, Rabinowitz asserts, to continue down this road and publish explanations of the Sharabian intentions and yiḥudim.In sum, the dissemination of tikkunim in the early twentieth century embedded kabbalistic customs among traditional society. On the other hand, though, it changed how the masses viewed sophisticated mortifications and fasts involving profound kavvanot for a select few. As part of their commit-ment to the general public, the kabbalah seminaries assumed the helm in all that concerns the shovavim rituals. Even if a distinction was made between vigils performed by seasoned intenters and those done on behalf and/or on the part of a wider segment of the populace, the efforts to promote these customs were directed outwards. In so doing, Jerusalem’s kabbalists paved the way for similar tikkunim that are observed with considerable pomp and fanfare in the present era.96 Special Prayers and Tikkunim during the HolocaustThe kabbalah seminaries hosted not only regular tikkunim, but special prayers in response to the exceptional events of the day. Following the local outbreak of meningitis in 1909, Sha’ar haShamayim and Rehovot haNahar jointly an-nounced a special prayer in the daily press.97 Approximately twenty-three years later, several of Jerusalem’s kabbalists held a vigil on behalf of “our Brethren the Jewish inhabitants of the land of Russia and Yemen who are un-der the pressure of an anti-religious decree, may the Merciful One save us.” More specifically, 72 men took part in a speech moratorium over three straight days (72-hours), with the objective of triggering God’s attribute of ḥesed 96 Nowadays, the best known public shovavim vigils are presided over by David Shalom Batz-ri at the Shalom Yeshiva in Jerusalem. These sort of rituals are also held at Yaakov Moshe Hillel’s Ahavat Shalom Seminary, albeit with less hoopla. Consistent with his dialectic ap-proach to revelation and concealment, Hillel criticizes the public tikkunim in his book on yemei ha’shovavim; idem, Takanat haShavim.

Suliman Mutzafi elaborated on several of these events. In 1942, around 150 people gathered at Rachel’s Tomb for a prayer to re-scind the evil decree against European Jewry. Similar services were held at the Western Wall and the city’s synagogues.99 Alfiya even travelled to Egypt for the sake of praying at Yaakov Abuhatzeira’s grave.100 Yehuda Fetayah devised a spe-cial prayer for his endangered brethren, which was distributed via pamphlets in around 1940. At a ceremony in which this supplication was recited, kabbal-ists were said to have filled up plates with tears.101 That same year, Shimon Horowitz printed a tikkun for revoking a charge against the congregation.102 Moreover, his signature, along with those of many other Jerusalem-based rab-bis, turns up on a announcement calling for “a general day of prayer” in light of the bitter news from Europe.10398 “Hitorerut,” in Kluger, Min haMeqor, vol. 2, 68.

For instance, years later, Gershom Scholem’s wife Fania recalled a peculiar meet-ing in Jerusalem involving her husband: “During the Second World War, a few kabbalists came here and asked him to teach them how to activate forces that would annihilate Hitler. Scholem told them that it is forbidden to awaken such elements. They nevertheless tried; and after Rudolf Hess fell in England, he said that they nearly succeeded.”104 Even if Scholem was being ironic, his spouse’s account certainly reflects an interesting reality. Similar tales were spun about the resident kabbalists of Sha’ar haShamayim. A letter by R. Moshe Yair Wein-stock to Yehuda Zev Leibowitz (both students of Yehuda Leib Ashlag) recounts the efforts of Horowitz and Moshe (Yemini) Skrovon, a kabbalist and apoca-lypse forecaster, to save the Jews of Europe. Among the measures that they adopted was to issue death sentences against Nazis, which the rabbis punctu-ated by sounding a shofar. According to Weinstock, believers were startled to discover that German generals whose names were announced in tandem with their mothers indeed perished.105...In sum, tikkunim and special prayers for the general public were integrated into the wide-ranging activities of Land-of-Israel kabbalists at the beginning of the twentieth century. This outreach was part and parcel of the concomitant “renaissance” of Jerusalem’s kabbalah seminaries. The figures under review no longer just paid lip service to exotericism, but sought to turn their institutions into “vigil centers” that the public would depend on in various ways. Although these yeshivot mainly catered to a select few that were engrossed in Jewish mysticism, they also offered the general public a peak at this world and created a new dynamic of mutual responsibility between their sages and every mem-ber of traditional Jewish society.104 Harpaz, “Metil Ṣel ’Anaq,” 50. R. Moshe Mordechai Biderman of Lelov also composed prayers for the sake of European Jewry; Henig, Moshe Ish haEloqim, vol. 1, 144–155.105 In this ca. 1967 letter, Weinstock also told Leibowitz of such prayers at the grave of Ḥayyim ben Moshe ibn Attar. See Leibowitz, Qol Yehuda, 178–179. This particular story assumes a different form in the Bratslav tradition. While resorting to similar measures in this version too, Horowitz recoiled from the actions of “the proprietors of practical kabbalah;” Schech-ter, Leqet Amarim, vol. 1, 59. Yehuda Leib Zusman, a disciple of Charlap, provides rough-ly the same account; Zussman, MiBeḥirei Ṣadiqaya, 168. Also see Ben Ami, Stories, 195.

A case in point is the caustic remarks about Jerusalem’s kabbalists, especially Sha’ar haShamayim’s habitués, that were scattered throughout the pages of the local Hebrew and Yiddish daily press. If the Beit El Yeshiva was emblematic of the putative decline of Jewish esoteric wisdom (as discussed in the opening chapter), then Sha’ar haShamayim was a symbol of corruption. Likewise, the city’s newspapers portrayed the rest of the kabbalists as cultural degenerates espousing a host of primitive beliefs that must be uprooted from the world. This perception rears up time and again in all of Eliezer Ben-Yehuda’s newspapers. However, these depictions tended to conflate the differences between folk beliefs, customs, the daily functioning of the yeshivot, and various kabbalistic outlooks. Valley of DemonsBack in 1885, Suliman Menachem Mani (the son of the above-mentioned kabbalist Eliyahu Suliman Mani) published a satirical piece, “Emeq haShedim” (the Valley of Demons), in the newspaper HaṢevi about a purported exorcism in the Yishuv.1 Among other things, the author condemned the belief in de-mons and the indulco. As Patai described at length, the indulco is a ceremony in which exorcists (usually female theurgists) blandish an invading spirit into leaving the host:[It] was a popular ritual intended to give something sweet to the demons and thereby propitiate them. This conforms to the principle employed throughout the ritual: everything sacred or holy is removed from the house in which it is performed, the patient himself (or herself ) must re-frain from uttering any word of prayer, from reciting any Biblical passage, and from going to the synagogue during the period of his “cure.”1 Mani, “Emeq haShedim.” This story and the life of its writer are elaborated on in haLevy, “HaMishamrim Hevlei Shaṿ,” 33–60; Yardeni, The Hebrew Press, 296–297; Hakak, Modern Hebrew Creativity, 94–107, 265–268; idem, The Emergence of Modern Hebrew Literature, 163–167. The latter two authors reprinted the deed. An abridged version of this episode appears in Yardeni, Sal ha’Anavim, 45–53."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"chapter 7206<UN>The intention of the ritual is thus clear: to propitiate, appease, the de-mons who are believed to have caused the disability, to appeal to their goodwill, sympathy, pity. The indulco therefore stands in sharp contrast to the customary methods of protecting a person against the demons or of exorcising them.... In the case of the indulco, the demons are treated gingerly, they are almost cuddled, everything unpleasant (such as words or emblems of holiness) are carefully removed from their way. The effort is directed, not toward keeping them out or expelling them, but toward inviting them, making their temporary stay as “sweet” as possible, and then, groveling before them, imploring them to return whatever they robbed from the patient. It is, in a word, a treatment of demons in exactly the same manner in which orthodox religion treats God. No wonder that rabbis found the indulco more abhorrent than any other “superstitious” practice.2Mani was a regular contributor to the Hebrew press during this period and even composed a wide assortment of poems. He was moved to write this article by an earlier piece on the indulco ceremony in Ben-Yehuda’s newspa-per, which cited the grievances of different rabbis against this technique.3 In this context, reference was made to a book by Abraham Moses Luncz (1856–1918) on “the ludicrous beliefs” maintained by inhabitants of Jerusalem that offers an accurate description of the indulco exorcism.4 Ben-Yehuda added that “the nonsense of the indulcah [sic] is customary among our brethren the Sephardim, but among our brethren the Ashkenazim there are also things of this sort.” Similar criticism, both lay and clerical, can be found in other contem-poraneous newspapers.5 Mani’s account includes quite a few elements that are highly reminiscent of the anti-Hasidic satirical literature of nineteenth- century Maskils in Eastern Europe, such as the work Emeq Refa’im (Valley of the Ghosts, 1823) by Isaac Baer Levinsohn and Joseph Perl’s book Megalleh Temirim 2 Patai, On Jewish Folklore, 302–308; idem, “Indulco and Mumia,” 3–11.

Therefore, it stands to reason that the author was nourished by this corpus.6The ensuing years bore witness to other descriptions of the indulco ceremo-ny. For instance, haShiloaḥ published a long article, “meḤaye haSfaradim,” by Avraham Elmaliach in 1911.7 “The scope is too narrow,” the writer opened this piece, “to contain all the stories, fables, and vapid beliefs that are found among our Sephardic brethren as well as the tales of demons.”8It bears noting that these popular folk beliefs and practices do not fall under the purview of Jewish esoteric wisdom. In consequence, erstwhile rabbis and kabbalists, including Mani the older, also objected to this phenomenon.9 As early as 1874, a resident of Jerusalem by the name of Menashe Sithon (ob. 1876) put out a book, Knisiya leShem Shamayim (Gathering for the Sake of Heaven), which was entirely devoted to abolishing this custom. This work netted quite a few approvals from major kabbalists in the Land of Israel and beyond, includ-ing Aharon Azriel, Raphael Yedidyah Abulafia, Eliyahu Mani, and Haim Palag-gi.10 Within the framework of this polemic, Yitzchak Eisik Yehda Yechiel Safrin (the Komarno Rebbe) formulated a letter on the boundaries of the practical kabbalah. Moreover, the grand rabbi fulminated against the indulco, which he defined as idol worship, but did not completely repudiate the existence of demons.11On the basis of the content they published, Ben-Yehuda and other secu-lar newspaper editors apparently did not believe that there was a difference between the indulco ceremony and, say, the Midnight Vigil or, for that mat-ter, any other kabbalah practice. Even if Menachem Mani would never have dreamed of finding fault with the kabbalah, his above-mentioned piece on the exorcism was certainly perceived by several of its readers as an attack on this entire body of knowledge, as many secularists placed all these activities under the same heading of “superstitions” that must be eradicated from the world. This sort of obfuscation between kabbalah and folk beliefs also informs 6 HaLevy, “HaMishamrim Hevlei Shaṿ,” 49–50.7 Elmaliach, “meḤaye haSfaradim,” 260–269, 354–359.

A Wondrous Tale: Coverage of a Dybbuk in the Jerusalem PressMa’ase Nora (A Wondrous Tale), which Ben-Zion Mordechai Hazan put into writing in 1904, includes the exorcism of a dybbuk in Jerusalem with the help of Rekhovot haNahar’s kabbalists, who availed themselves of a closeted manu-script of Hayyim Vital on practical kabbalah.12 That same year, the chief rabbi’s account was run in Eliezer Ben-Yehuda’s newspaper Hashqafa.13 The editor prefaced Hazan’s story with the following words: “The Land has yet to run out of suckers and swindlers. Some time ago, the booklet Ma’ase Nora was printed in Jerusalem, which is worthy of being published in public, so that the readers will see until where the belief in nonsense reaches and how great is the power of the swindlers. Here, then, is the content of the pamphlet word by actual word.”14 The deed was indeed copied in its entirety, without significant changes, on the assumption that there is no greater derision than the hard facts. In line with Ben-Yehuda’s Maskilic crusade against “the ludicrous beliefs,” Hashqafa repeatedly mocked the kabbalists of the Land of Israel in all the newspaper’s sections throughout the rest of that year.15 For example, one of the paper’s an-nouncements opens with the following words: “Not only in Jerusalem are there weeds. This grass will also grow and blossom, praise be He, in all the climes, and not only the sacred soil of E[retz] Y[israel], but even the defiled soil of he-retical France.

In a cynical yet detailed 1911 article in HaOr, Itamar Ben-Avi (Ben-Yehuda’s son) and Salomon Israel Cherezli surveyed the annals of this yeshiva. Given its importance to understanding the negative, secular outlook on the kabbalah, we will cite from this piece at length:From the kabbalists’ camp. Since the day the Beit El Synagogue was estab-lished by Master Shalom Sharabi of blessed memory – it was always full of people, Torah luminaries, who had a hand in the wisdom of truth [i.e., the kabbalah]. For this reason, they always had a special right to send dis-patches among themselves, as though the Beit El Synagogue was a special “kollel.” And so long as the h[oly] c[ommunity] of Beit El is steadily empty-ing itself of its content, behold we have seen that a movement of this sort [i.e., a kabbalah revival] has arisen among the Ashkenazic community, with all the more vigor and by dint of those young in days. It is now some four years since the establishment in our city of a yeshiva, by the name of Sha’ar haShamayim, where every day young avrekhim [young, married seminarians] from the Ashkenazic community gather. Little by little, a few elders have joined them, as well as Sephardic, Bukharian, and Georgian colleagues. There they are studying kabbalah books in piecemeal fashion. They placed at their head the rabbi/kabbalist Menahem Menkhin Hal-perin and the rabbi Shimon Horowitz of Lida, who travelled great distanc-es with the renowned Jerusalemite delegation to search for the Ten Tribes and the Sambatyon. Avraikhim train in the kavvanot and yiḥudim. To this end, they managed to reprint Shaʻar haHaqdamot and Eṣ Ḥayyim by our teacher the rabbi Hayyim Vital with “beautiful commentaries.” Upon reaching the high level of beginning to pray according to the siddur of R[abbi] S[halom] Sharabi of blessed memory, at this point was mounted before them, at Satan’s behest, the big obstacle of a shortage of such prayer books, which until now were in manuscript form in twelve parts or more. Merely writing them would have cost hundreds of francs. This [sum] is not within every person’s reach. And behold, with God’s will, they pulled it off and with the assistance of R. Reuven Haas and other patrons and friends, they also managed to raise this large siddur, with all the additions and yiḥudim, onto the “printing rollers.” And they have already printed until barukh she’amar [Blessed is Thee who Said – part of the morning prayer], 143 beautiful and illuminating pages. That said, with this [publication], they [i.e., the seminary’s detractors] organized opposition against them on the part of the more fearing [Orthodox elements], as they said that holy names and terrifying additions like this cannot be printed at all.What is more, they [i.e., Sha’ar haShamayim] also managed to estab-lish a chapter outside the city by the name of Kahal Ḥasidim.

Of course, the two authors naturally derided all of these under-takings. The same can be said for the following excerpt from the 1912 story in HaOr, which was discussed in the previous chapter:Those same people, like the rabbi from Hrodna [i.e., Halperin], like R. Aryeh [sic] Leib Auerbach, and like R. Shimon Lider (a few years ago, the latter went to search for the Ten Tribes and the Sambatyon River), sat down, they sat and thought of how to get publicity for their business so that the money will begin to flow into their pocket? – Seven days and nights they kept their nose to the grindstone and begot a great idea – to call their business by the name of the Sha’ar haShamayim Yeshiva. Can you come up with a finer name for a business like this? This is how the seminary was born.18The article ends with a description of a flyer on tikkun ha’brit that was circulat-ed in the woman sections of prayer houses. According to Sulami, these notices “explained to the righteous women the entire matter of masturbation with a thorough explanation. All [this was] for the money, to prod and encourage the righteous women to give their pennies to the rabbis and the kabbalah prac-titioners like them.”19 As we have seen, the kabbalists formulated a scathing reply to these accusations, which was circulated throughout Jerusalem in the 17 Ben-Avi and Cherezli, “MiMaḥane haMequbalim,” 3.18 Sulami, “MeInyanei Yerushalayim,” 3.19 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"211Censure, Parody And Debate<UN>form of a notice. The respondents’ objective was not to protect the yeshiva per se, but the ascetic customs during yemei ha’shovavim.20In 1918, another newspaper survey by one of “Jerusalem’s Maskils” produced a similar account of the local kabbalah scene. Signing off with the pseudonym Megalleh Temirim (the name of Joseph Perl’s above-cited anti-Hasidic satire), he deemed the public enterpirse of the city’s kabbalists to be nothing more than a fundraising ploy, and the same can be said for Horowitz’s expedition in search of the Lost Tribes.21 From the writer’s standpoint, there was no dif-ference between the eighteenth-century Hasidic figures that are ridiculed in Megalleh Temirim and the kabbalists in his midst. Mendele Moykher Sforim, the Sambatyon and the Kabbalists of JerusalemHorowitz’s famed voyage was also pilloried in earlier works. As far back as 1899, one Mordecai Monosovich published an ironic account titled “The Trip to the Sambatyon River.” Although he quotes from the organizers’ own description of their trip, Monosovich felt that they were motivated to disseminate this notice by financial considerations and nothing else.22Shortly after, we find references to the voyage in the writing of Mendele Moykher Sforim (the pseudonym of Shalom Ya’akov Abramovitsh). In 1903, the pioneering Yiddish and Hebrew author published “Agadot haAdmonim” (Myths of the Admonites, a moniker for the Sons of Moses) – a quasi introduc-tion to a sequel of his parodic work Mas’ot Binyamin haShlishi (the Travels of Benjamin the Third), which debuted in Yiddish back in 1879. Predicated on one of the announcements that were circulated by Horowitz and his cohorts in the run-up to their trip, Abramovitsh’s story expressly mentions the names of all the kabbalists who were involved in this undertaking.23 In the 1903 introduc-tion, the protagonist, Benjamin, joins forces with them and heads out, once more, into the great yonder. While some contemporaneous observers viewed the kabbalists’ renewed interest in the Lost Tribes to be a Romantic-utopian 20 “BiDvar Shovavim Tat,” 1912 (announcement); see the discussion on this topic in the previous chapter.21 Megale Temirin, “Kabala Ma’asit,” 1.22 Monsovits, “HaNesi’a leNahar Sambatiyon,” 290.23 Abramovitsh, “Agadot haAdmonim,” 145–149 His words are predicated on the kabbal-ists’ notice; Sefer Drishat Kvod Ḥakhmei haTora.

In their estimation, this date hints to the First Zionist Congress (another “victim” of Mendele’s “abuse,” which was held a year earlier).27 Even if this hypothesis is correct, the objective behind “To become Known and be Revealed” was certainly to disparage the kabbalists’ journey, as evidenced by its reference to their known booklet on the expedition, which also came out in 1898. As in “Agadot haAdmonim,” here too Benjamin iii leads the kabbalists of Jerusalem on their quest for the Lost Tribes:While busy publishing my story The Travels of Benjamin the Third, the newspapers have passed on the rumor that our adventurer, Benjamin is now off for the second time, heading up a band of explorers in those same distant lands and faraway islands beyond the Mountains of Dark-ness.

He is guiding them like a horse through the terrible wilderness – the home of serpents and despotic Gentiles, like Prester John and the heretic el-Torek.28In sum, Mendele dusted off the age-old satires on Jewish expeditions in search of the Ten Tribes. Against the backdrop of Horowitz’s voyage, The Travels of Benjamin the Third, which debuted over twenty years before this episode, took on a whole new meaning. Like Monosovich’s work and the short parody by Megalleh Temirim, this take on the kabbalist’s trip draws on the 1898 notice by its organizers, who are mocked as unrealistic adventurers or money- hungry schemers. It is only natural, then, that the yeshiva Horowitz subsequently founded was the target of similar accusations. The “Last” Adversaries: Deinard’s Burial of the Kabbalah and the Yihyah Qafiḥ PolemicThanks in part to some of their own public communications, Jerusalem’s kabbalists were perceived as both slackers and active panhandlers. Less pejoratively, they were also viewed as hallucinators futilely chasing far-fetched dreams. Be that as it may, by the early 1920s, the torrent of criticism against them had slowed to a trickle. The most outspoken and persistent detractor was the author, traveler, merchant, and bibliographer Ephraim Deinard (1846–1930), who waged a quixotic struggle against any expression of mysticism in Jewish literature, for all its hues and genres.29 Deinard only calmed down after completing a book in which he symbolically buried the 28 Abramovitsh, Mas’ot Binyamin haShlishi, 87. Reports to the contrary notwithstanding, this passage is excluded from the 1896–1897 edition of the book.29 For a synopsis of his views on the kabbalah and Hasidism, see Deinard, Alatah/Am To’ei Levav. Gershom Scholem wrote the following observation inside the cover of his personal copy: “A wondrous book! Almost every line is a lie – and everything he says with added assurance, with ‘facts,’ dates, interconnections – is all bastardized, incomprehensible, or simply fabricated, and it is impossible to criticize sentence after sentence.

Simeon ben Yochai. Fittingly, this work ended with a Kaddish for Jewish mystical literature:The (practical and theoretical) kabbalah has taken its last breadth and reached the end, of this there is no doubt... Anyone connected to litera-ture knows this. The [ Jewish] people have ceased to even mention the word kabbalah, as though it never existed. It died forty years ago, in the previous generation of the Haskalah. All this time, it was lying in the cof-fin and nobody came to see it, no one made an effort to bring it to burial...to give a eulogy, to weep over its passing. Upon reaching the autumn of my life, I said that I would do some good deed for my people, to bring it [i.e., the kabbalah] to a proper Jewish burial.30In making this case, Deinard was completely oblivious to the traditional kabbalah’s renaissance then underway in the Land of Israel as well as similar developments in various streams, both within and outside the fold of Judaism. The scores of books that he published notwithstanding, Deinard’s polemics largely fell on deaf ears. In fact, they are akin to a desperate, futile, and poorly-attended demonstration against the emergence of an all-too-real new world order in which the concealed Torah was indeed blossoming....The era’s kabbalists also faced adversaries from within traditional society. Ob-jections raised in a couple of books by Yihyah Qafih (1850–1931), a Yemenite rabbi, kicked up a fierce storm that would last for several decades31 Until then, the kabbalists had by and large ignored the derisive barbs against their way of life in the Land-of-Israel press (save for the above-mentioned article on sho-vavim-tat). This time around, though, the criticism came from an Orthodox figure and was directed at Toranic institutions and the very essence of the kab-balah. As a result, the kabbalah elite felt compelled to break their silence and bare their knuckles. The controversy in Yemen reached the gates of Palestine as early as 1913, where it caught the eye of local journalists. As expressed in the following, 1914 announcement, Jerusalem’s kabbalists decided to excommuni-cate Qafiḥ and his allies:30 Deinard, Alatah, 111–112.31 For more on this debate, see Meir, “Wrestling with the Esoteric,” 615–619.

They opened their mouths to denigrate the sacred Zohar and the holy divine tanna RaShBY, may his virtue protect us amen, and the books of the kabbalists, may their virtue protect us amen, which were published and accepted in all the Diasporas of the Jewish people, and the holy books of the Shulḥan Arukh. Woe onto them for this affront to the Torah. Remove the turban and lift off the crown [Ezekiel 21:31], [stuff ] their mouth with soil. We heard [their accusations] and our stom-achs are raging, our face has fallen, and our knees have buckled. We are languishing in our humiliation and are covered by our indignity, for this major impediment and weakness has arisen in our day. We stand trem-bling with a frightened and defeated heart from trepidation of God and the splendor of his brilliance amid the jealousy, the jealousy for the hon-or of the sacred Book of the Zohar and its author the RaShBY may his merit protect us. With the assemblage and gathering of the rabbis, we have taken to our feet with one heart. The Almighty will protect them. Our feet once stood in Your gates of Jerusalem – lower Jerusalem, as op-posed to Jerusalem on high. And we opened the Holy Ark and excommu-nicated the inveterate sinners who impugn the sacred Zohar and the like. Therefore, upon the arrival of this letter to their lands and places, every Jew is duty bound to stand before the ark of God and excommunicate these transgressors.This call to arms is followed by the text of the excommunication itself and the signatures of dozens of rabbis from, inter alia, Rekhovot haNahar and Sha’ar haShamayim, most notably Dweck-HaKohen, Yom Tov Yedid Halevi, Shalom Hedaya, Ben-Zion Mordechai Hazan, Shaul Kassin, Horowitz, and Auerbach.32In turn, Qafiḥ put out a rejoinder by the name of “Amal ṿeRe’ut Ruaḥ ṿeḤaramot ṿeTshuvatam” (Toil and Comradery, Spirit and Excommunications and the Answer to Them), which includes the text of the excommunication. 32 Qafiḥ, ’Amal ṿeRe’ut Ruaḥ ṿeḤaramot ṿeTshuvatam, 3–5.

They knew not with what to obstruct him [i.e., the author].”33In 1931, Qafiḥ’s magnum opus, Sefer Milḥamot Hashem (God’s Wars), came out in Jerusalem and was instantly banned in Yemen and Palestine.34 This work excoriated kabbalah theology, the use of the spheres, and the esoteric literature in general. Qafiḥ’s objective was to present kabbalah as an invasive species in the ecosystem of Judaism as well as a form of idolatry and outright heresy. Put differently, it was a corpus that should be personally avoided at all costs and a phenomenon that should be rooted out of traditional Jewish society by any and all means. After the rabbi’s demise the following year, some of Yemen’s sages penned a response to his outlook on the kabbalah. Their words were incorporated into the 1938 book Emunat HaShem (Beliefs of God), which was printed in Jerusalem. Tens of rabbis and kabbalists prefaced the book with approvals, both short and long. In toto, these approvals offer the most lucid reflection of what was going on at the time in the field of kabbalah. For instance, they demonstrate the extent to which Jewish esoteric knowledge had gained a foothold in traditional Jewish society. Apart from condemning Qafiḥ, the book’s endorsers praise the kabbalah and stress the importance of studying this body of knowledge. Among the book’s champions was Shimon Zvi Horowitz, whose approval excoriated the kabbalah’s detractors: “And it is worthy to fight against them, to defeat them, and humiliate them, etc. until they fully repent, regret their bad deeds and false views, and condemn to incin-eration all the distorted books that are rife with heresy for the sake of prevent-ing them from misleading innocent people.” He then signed off with the title “R[osh] Y[eshiva] of all the kabbalists in the city of Jerusalem, may it be built and completed/RY of the seminary Sha’ar haShamayim and the head of the kabbalists in J[erusalem], may it be built and completed.”35 The Qafiḥ debate would reverberate powerfully among the Yemenites in later years as well. How-ever, it had no real implications on the kabbalah circles in the Land of Israel, as the seminaries continued along the same path. Moreover, it barely echoed in traditional society. For all intents and purposes, the thundering voice of the kabbalah’s critics was muffled and vanquished.33 Qafiḥ, ’Amal ṿeRe’ut Ruaḥ ṿeḤaramot ṿeTshuvatam, 9.34 Qafiḥ, Sefer Milḥamot Hashem.35 Emunat HaShem (1938).

The scholar occasionally jotted down relevant com-ments on the margins of personal copies of these works. Over the course of his lifetime, Scholem also met a considerable number of the city’s kabbalists. Although he commented on these encounters on the said margins and in personal documents that were left in his estate, none of Scholem’s many and manifold published works survey his impressions of these figures. Until re-cently, living kabbalists continued to be ignored in the research literature. The consensus surrounding Jewish esoteric wisdom and its dissemination in the early twentieth century is undoubtedly in need of major revisions. It is no lon-ger plausible to speak of “the remnants of the kabbalists” or ponder “the last survivor” of this fellowship. Moreover, theories whereby Jerusalem’s kabbalists were few in number and far from innovative have been thoroughly debunked. On the other hand, canvassing a few exceptional personages, like Yehuda Leib Ashlag and Abraham Isaac Kook, on the grounds that they embody the kab-balah enterprise of the period under review is an ill-advised strategy as well. To a certain extent, Ashlag and Kook were marginal figures in their own lifetime. It was only years later that their direct and secondary disciples, as well as those riding on their coattails, managed to shift the spotlight onto these two figures.Working on the assumption that they were in the midst of an age of revela-tion, early twentieth-century kabbalists in Jerusalem, foremost among them the RaShaSh’s acolytes, endeavored to spread the learning of Jewish esoteric wisdom to all members of traditional society using the limited tools at their disposal. In this respect, Rekhovot haNahar and Sha’ar haShamayim are indica-tive of the substantial changes in the approach to the kabbalah and its dissemi-nation during the period in question (even if they ultimately refrained from expanding its borders beyond their greater community and the lion’s share of their printing enterprise was channeled inward to a select few). The plans of these kabbalists were indeed greater than their actions, but these shortcom-ings, inter alia, reflect the state of the Kabbalah in the beginning of the 1900s. The search for the Ten Tribes was largely the preserve of a couple of Sha’ar haShamayim’s habitués, as this quest was not universally embraced by their fellow kabbalists. At any rate, the quest to find the Sons of Moses betrays an attempt to integrate a religious narrative into the Jewish national revival. In essence, the foundations that were laid by the kabbalah seminaries during the first half of the twentieth century is primarily responsible for the kabbalah’s"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"Afterword218<UN>contemporary blossoming among Orthodox Jews. In sum, a reassessment of what transpired in the Land of Israel’s kabbalah circles during the early 1900s is a prerequisite not only for improving our picture of the past, but for under-standing current developments in this field. However, this is but a single part of a wider story. Besides the stirrings among the traditional masses, Jewish eso-teric wisdom penetrated beyond the borders of Judaism. This turn of events would also have major ramifications on “old-school” kabbalists during the latter half of the twentieth century."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"<UN>BibliographyAbadi, Mordekhai.
