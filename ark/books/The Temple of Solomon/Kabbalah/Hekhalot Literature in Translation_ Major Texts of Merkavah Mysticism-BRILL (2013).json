Each paragraph is normally attributed(pseudepigraphically) to a Tannaitic rabbi, almost always R. Akiva, R. Ishmael,or R. Nehuniah ben HaQanah.2Broadly speaking, the Hekhalot literaturefocuses on two main themes. The \brst is how a practitioner may ascend(or, frequently and paradoxically, “descend”3) to heaven in order to betransformed, at least temporarily, into a being of \bre; to join in the angelicliturgy in the divine throne room; and to sit enthroned, sometimes on God’slap, and be granted theurgic power. The second is how the practitioner maygain control over angels, especially the Sar Torah or Prince of Torah whocan grant expertise in rabbinic Torah lore without the need for the normalarduous study.These texts are \blled with descriptions of the seven-tiered heaventhat contains sevenhekhalot(“palaces,” hence, “Hekhalot literature”),1For basic orientation to the Hekhalot literature see Peter Schäfer,The Hidden andManifest Godand James R. Davila,Descenders to the Chariot, chapter 1. For reservationsabout the use of the term “mysticism” for these texts, see ibid., chapter two, and Schäfer,The Origins of Jewish Mysticism, chapter one. Ra#anan S. Boustan has a recent discussion ofthe current state of the question in Hekhalot studies in “The Study of Heikhalot Literature:Between Mystical Experience and Textual Artifact.” The main editions of the texts areSchäfer et al.,Synopse zur Hekhalot-Literaturand Schäfer,Geniza Fragmente zur Hekhalot-Literature. All citations below are given according to the paragraph and text numbering inthese editions.2TheTannaimwere Palestinian Jewish sages from the \brst to early third centuriescewhose sayings are quoted in the Mishnah.3Various explanations of this odd idiom have been proposed, none of them fullyconvincing. See Annelies Kuyt,The “Descent” to the Chariot; Christopher R.A. Morray-Jones,“The Temple Within,” esp. pp. 171–178."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"2chapter oneconcentrically arranged, with the centermost, and evidently the largest,containing the celestial throne room, with God seated on his throne-chariotsurrounded by attending angels who sing the celestial liturgy. But for themost part the texts are not simply descriptions of the heavenly realm, theyare instruction manuals on how to carry out the two main goals, the heavenlyascent or “descent to the chariot” and the acquiring of power over angels,especially the Prince of Torah. The instructions consist of detailed accountsof the ritual practices to be performed, along with the texts of numeroussongs and adjurations to be sung and recited. These songs and adjurations areoften beautiful and carefully crafted poetic pieces, but these are interspersedand interlarded with long lists of divine names, nonsense words (nominabarbara), and names of angels, all of which are, again, intended for recitationin the rituals.Unlike the Second-Temple-era and later apocalypses (see below), thefocus of the Hekhalot literature is on this instructional material ratherthan on stories involving the adventures of its protagonists. Nevertheless,one narrative about the Tannaitic rabbis that also appears in the rabbinictexts is found in the Hekhalot literature and has received a good deal ofattention in both Jewish tradition and the scholarly literature. This is theStory of the Four Who EnteredPardes(the “garden” or “paradise”). It isfound in theHekhalot Zutarti(§§ 338–339, 344–346, 348; G7) andMerkavahRabba(§§ 671–673) and is alluded to in3 Enoch(chapter 16 = § 20) andan independent fragment at § 597. (For these documents, see the nextsection.) According to the story, the four sages, Akiva and three others,usually named as Ben Azzay, Ben Zoma, and A ̇her (“the Other”—Elishaben Avuyah), enteredpardes. In the Hekhalot version, this is identi\bed withthe celestial Paradise. When each arrived at the entrance to the sixth palace,they perceived the alabaster stones there as though they were myriads ofwaves of water about to swamp them. Ben Azzay asked what the natureof these waters was and was promptly killed by the angels in that palace.Ben Zoma refrained from asking this, but the e\u0010fort cost him his sanity.A ̇her “cut the plants,” an obscure term, interpreted in di\u0010ferent ways, butamounting to saying that his experience in the sixth palace led him tobecome the arch-heretic of Jewish tradition. The original meaning of theStory of the Four is debated, with some scholars arguing that it was originallya parable involving proper exegesis of scripture, with the context of heavenlyascents being a later reinterpretation, and others taking the position thatit involved heavenly ascents from the beginning. The so-called “water test”also appears on its own in both theHekhalot Zutarti(§§ 408–410) and theHekhalot Rabbati(§ 259) as one of the tests facing any descender to the"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"introduction3chariot who wishes to pass through the sixth palace and into the divinethrone room.42.The TextsBroadly speaking, there are two sources for the texts of the Hekhalotliterature. First, there are some forty-seven manuscripts dating from the HighMiddle Ages onward which contain mostly complete copies of the largercompositions.5Second, the Cairo Geniza (an important cache of manuscriptsrecovered in the late nineteenth century from the geniza6of the Ben EzraSynagogue in Old Cairo) has preserved numerous early medieval fragmentsof Hekhalot texts, some of documents known from the later manuscripts andsome otherwise unknown.The boundaries and contents of the individual larger compositions arefrequently di\u0010\bcult to de\bne, inasmuch as the basic unit of these documents,as is noted above, consists of single paragraphs (“microforms” in Schäfer’sterminology) which frequently stand on their own. The larger compositionsor “macroforms” consist of collections of these microforms and a givenmacroform often appears in the manuscripts in multiple recensions thatcontain more or fewer microforms in somewhat di\u0010ferent orderings. Thus,although it is convenient to group the Hekhalot literature by its macroformsand these groups tell us something about the transmission history andinterpretation of the traditions, the fullest understanding of the materialcomes only through careful attention to the individual microforms. Schäfer’ssynoptic edition of seven important Hekhalot manuscripts has made thetextual \u0000\u0002uidity of the macroforms abundantly clear, and this edition, alongwith his edition of the Hekhalot Geniza fragments, now provides the textualfoundation for the study of the Hekhalot literature.74For the state of the question regarding the Story of the Four, see the discussion andbibliography later in this chapter and in chapter four. For the water test and the entrance test(Hekhalot Zutarti§ 407 andHekhalot Rabbati§ 258) see Joseph Dan, “The Entrance of the SixthPalace” (cf. idem,The Ancient Jewish Mysticism, chapter vi) and J. Maier, “Das Gefährdungsmotifbei der Himmelsreise.”5These manuscripts are surveyed by Schäfer in “Handschriften zur Hekhalot-Literatur”and by Klaus Herrmann inMassekhet Hekhalot, 22–65.6A “geniza” is a repository for worn manuscripts on which the name of God is written. Themanuscripts are retained in a geniza until they can be disposed of in an acceptable manneraccording to Jewish tradition. Over a period lasting a millennium the Cairo Geniza was usedto discard a vast number of old manuscripts, not all of which contained the name of God.7Schäfer et al.,Synopse.

Along with numerous Merkavah hymns about the glories ofboth the celestial realm and of the descenders to the chariot, it includesa version of the Story of the Ten Martyrs, which is known elsewhere inJewish tradition in various forms; an instructional account of a descentto the chariot by R. Nehuniah in the company of his disciples; and adescription of the water test.8•Sar Torah9(§§ 281–306), the “Prince of Torah,” gives instructions onhow to summon and control the Prince of Torah so as to compel him toreveal knowledge of Torah to the practitioner. This macroform almostalways is appended to theHekhalot Rabbatiand there are signi\bcantmanuscript variations in the last third of it.•Hekhalot Zutarti(approximately §§ 335–375, 407–426), the “Lesser(Book of the Heavenly) Palaces,” survives in somewhat varied manu-scripts and contains adjurational material; the above-mentioned Storyof the Four Who Entered Paradise; and a set of instructions for thedescent to the chariot.10•Ma#aseh Merkavah(§§ 544–596), the “Working of the Chariot,” is a col-lection of adjurations and rituals for controlling angels and ascendingto heaven; descriptions of the heavenly realm; and Merkavah hymns.The manuscripts survive in three recensions.11Synopse, see Daniel Abrams, “Critical and Post-Critical Textual Scholarship of Jewish MysticalLiterature,” esp. pp. 33–45 and idem,Kabbalistic Manuscripts, 37–47, 475–489. A Germantranslation of the texts in theSynopseis found in Schäfer and Herrmann et al.,Übersetzungder Hekhalot-Literatur I §§ 1–80; Schäfer et al.,Übersetzung der Hekhalot-Literatur II §§ 81–334;idem,Übersetzung der Hekhalot-Literatur III §§ 335–597; idem,Übersetzung der Hekhalot-Literatur IV §§ 598–985. The Geniza fragments are published by Schäfer inGeniza Fragmente.Another crucially important tool for the study of the Hekhalot literature is Schäfer withGottfried Reeg et al.,Konkordanz zur Hekhalot-Literatur.8See also Schäfer, “Zum Problem der redaktionellen Identität vonHekhalot Rabbati”;Davila, “Prolegomena to a Critical Edition of the Hekhalot Rabbati.”9I italicize the phraseSar Torahwhen it refers to this particular macroform and write itin Roman type as Sar Torah when it refers either to the angel with that name or to other ritualpractices involving this angel.10Rachel Elior published an earlier edition inHekhalot Zutarti. See also Schäfer, “Au\u0000\u0003auund redaktionelle Identität derHekhalot Zutarti.”11Alexander Altman published excerpts of theMa#aseh Merkavahin “Shire Qedushahbe-Sifrut ha-Hekhalot ha-Qedumah.” Gershom G.

It survives in a long and a short recension.12•Sefer Hekhalot(§§ 1–79), “The Book of the Palaces,” is also known as3 Enoch(after [Ethiopic]1 Enochand [Slavonic]2 Enoch). This textcomes in the form of an apocalypse, a revelatory discourse granted toR. Ishmael, who ascends to heaven and there meets the angel Metatron(the patriarch Enoch transformed into an archangel). Metatron relatesthe history of his own exaltation and enthronement, as well as of hisdethronement when Elisha ben Avuyah ascended and mistook himfor a second god (see on the Story of the Four Who Entered Paradiseabove). Metatron then takes R. Ishmael on a long tour of the universe.This work survives in a long and a short recension, with variations evenamong these. It contains no magical or ritual material, although thefragment from the Cairo Geniza (see below) does include some suchmaterial.13•Shi#ur Qomah, the “Measure of the Stature,” consists of diverse materialthat focuses on the measurements and names of the various giganticbody parts of God. Schäfer’sSynopsecontains some material from thiscorpus, but the major complete manuscripts and recensions have beenedited by Martin Samuel Cohen.14•Massekhet Hekhalot, the “Treatise of the Palaces,” is a borderline casethat arguably should not be included among the Hekhalot literature.It contains detailed descriptions of the celestial realm, but these arenot connected to a heavenly ascent and there are no ritual instructions,song and adjurations, or Sar Torah materials.

It is preceded in the manuscript byShi#ur Qomahmaterial.17•Fragments of theHekhalot Rabbati(G1–G6),18theHekhalot Zutarti(G7,G16, G18), an otherwise unknown recension of the beginning of3 Enoch(G12),19theSar Panim(G1), andShi#ur Qomahtraditions (G4, G8, G9,G10, G11). Sometimes these fragments provide a better text than themuch later complete medieval manuscripts.•Other texts published inGeniza Fragmentefall on the borderline ofthe Hekhalot literature. One may well include the fragment involvingMetatron and Moses (G19), but we should exclude the work known asSheva Zutarti(the “Lesser Adjuration”) orSheva Eliyahu(the “Adjurationof Elijah”), copies of which are found in G13–G17 and elsewhere. G11also contains an otherwise unknown passage about Metatron. G20 is acollection of magical recipes for various practical purposes. G21 openswith an adjuration but then segues into a long account of the ascent ofMoses to heaven. G23 is fromPereq Shirah, a text outside the Hekhalotcorpus, known from elsewhere.16For the genre “incantation prayer” see Schäfer, “Jewish Magic Literature,” 76–79.17Both the Ozhayah Fragment and the Unicum Fragment were originally published byIthamar Gruenwald in “New Passages from Hekhalot Literature.” It is entirely possible (andindeed likely, given the recovery of G8, G19, and G22, discussed below) that other texts existedin the Geonic era which we would class as Hekhalot literature had they survived. Dan notespossible quotations from such lost works in “Hekhalot Texts in the Middle Ages,” 89.18Schäfer has also published another very interesting Geniza fragment of theHekhalotRabbatiin “Ein neuesHekhalot Rabbati-Fragment.”19See also Schäfer, “Ein neues Fragment zur Metoposkopie und Chiromantik.”"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"introduction7Still other texts from the Geniza and elsewhere have thematic overlapsand connections with the Hekhalot literature, but should not be classedas part of that literature.20Re\"uot Ye ̇hezqel, the “Visions of Ezekiel” is amidrashic work that describes the visionary ascent of Ezekiel through theseven heavens, using some of the same terminology and ideas as those foundin the Hekhalot literature.21Seder Rabba de Bereshit, the “Great Order ofCreation,” is a cosmological tractate that describes the seven heavens and theseven hells.22Various magical tractates such asSefer HaRazim, the “Book of theMysteries” include adjurations and cosmological speculations with parallelsto the Hekhalot texts, as do some of the fragments of magical handbooksand treatises recovered from the Geniza.23There are also physiognomictreatises that describe a person’s character and destiny based on their physicalappearance and these refer to themes and practices known from the Hekhalottexts.24This volume translates most of the major macroforms in chapters twothrough six:Hekhalot Rabbati,Sar Torah,Hekhalot Zutarti,Ma#aseh Merkavah,andMerkavah Rabba. The shorter texts mentioned above are also translatedin chapter seven:The Chapter of R. Nehuniah ben HaQanah,The Great Seal-Fearsome Crown,Sar Panim,The Ascent of Elisha ben Avuyah, andThe Youth.In chapter eight the Geniza fragments ofHekhalot Rabbati,Hekhalot Zutarti,3 Enoch,Sar Panim, and some related material (G1–7, G12, G16, and G75) aretranslated, as are G8, G19, and G22.I have chosen not to translate three of the longer macroforms.

Although an English translation is a desideratum, forreasons noted above it is doubtful that this text should be included in theHekhalot corpus and I do not translate it here. TheShi#ur Qomahcorpus isa loose collection of traditions rather than a single text and its relationshipto the other Hekhalot texts is somewhat tangential. Cohen has produced atranslation of the various recensions. His work, however, needs to be revisedto take fully into account the much earlier Geniza material published bySchäfer. This would be a worthy project in itself, but it is one outside thescope of this volume. In the introduction to chapter eight I have discussedmy reasons for including or excluding Geniza manuscripts published inGeniza-Fragmente.3.Key Issues in Research on the Hekhalot LiteratureHeavenly Ascents and Sar Torah AdjurationsThe question of the central themes of the Hekhalot literature has generatedmuch discussion and debate in the last generation, with two themes emergingas especially important. The \brst is the heavenly ascent (or “descent to thechariot”), instructions for which appear in theHekhalot Rabbati(§§ 198–237) and theHekhalot Zutarti(§§ 407–426)26The second is the control ofangels for various purposes, especially adjurations and ritual instructions tocompel the Prince of Torah to descend and reveal expertise in Torah lore tothe practitioner. Gershom G. Scholem, the pioneer of critical study of theHekhalot literature in the twentieth century, saw the ascent traditions as thecentral theme of the Hekhalot literature, with the adjurations and ritualspreparatory to them, and the aim of the ascent to achieve a direct vision ofGod. Although he thought the adjurational material in the Hekhalot texts to“belong to the very core of their particular religious system,” he regarded atleast much of the Sar Torah traditions as a later and somewhat degenerateaspect of these texts.2726Additional references to heavenly ascents in the context of ritual instruction includeMa#aseh Merkavah§§ 547, 550, 570, 591–596; G8; G22 1b 27–30.27Scholem,Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism, 40–79, quotation on p. 51. See also idem,Jewish Gnosticism, 12–13. Gruenwald has argued a similar position, dividing the Hekhalotliterature into genuinely “mystical” heavenly ascent traditions and traditions about theappearance of angels on earth to reveal mysteries. He argues that the Sar Torah materialsare later, post-mystical developments.

Halperin, and Martha Him-melfarb began to challenge this understanding of the texts and to showthat elements of it were unsatisfactory. A considerably larger proportionof the Hekhalot literature is devoted to adjurations and rituals involvingthe coercion of the Prince of Torah and other angels than to the heavenlyascent.28Apart from naïve theories of evolutionary religious thought, thereis no inherent reason to suppose that mystical thinking involving an ascentto heaven to experience the beati\bc vision is more original or fundamentalthan magical thinking of the type involving adjurations and rituals for thecoercion of angels to do the will of the practitioner. And a close reading ofthe texts shows that the purpose of the heavenly ascent is more complex andless obviously mystical than was thought at \brst. The ascent in theHekhalotRabbaticulminates in the seating of the practitioner in the celestial throneroom, where the choir of angels regales him with their music, and in a laterascent passage (Hekhalot Rabbati§§ 251–257) a practitioner who reaches thethrone of God recites the hymns sung by the throne itself. In theHekhalotZutartithe practitioner is seated on the lap of God and granted whateverwish he desires.29The vision of God, although apparently an important partof the process of ascent, is not its aim and purpose.It is clear that the heavenly ascent and the Sar Torah traditions must bedistinguished; that each must be understood on its own terms; and that ritualand adjuration are central to the Hekhalot literature and cannot be regardedas secondary or less valid than the ascent. Debate continues on whethersome central overarching theme can subsume and make sense of both thesecore themes.Exegesis, Experience, and PraxisScholem accepted that actual practitioners made use of the rituals in theHekhalot texts and that the descriptions of the ascents and angelic encoun-ters on some level re\u0000\u0002ected experiences that arose from these practices.Moreover, he understood that the warnings in the Tannaitic and Amoraic3028Halperin, “A New Edition of the Hekhalot Literature,” esp. pp. 549–551; Schäfer, “TheAim and Purpose of Early Jewish Mysticism,” esp. pp. 282; idem,The Hidden and Manifest God,150–157; Himmelfarb,Ascent to Heaven in Jewish and Christian Apocalypses, 95–114.29Schäfer, “Aim and Purpose,” 285–289.

Halperin concluded that the Tannaitic tradi-tions about this material knew nothing of the Hekhalot traditions, but ratherreferred to traditions of scriptural exegesis that the rabbis found objection-able.32He went on to elaborate this position in a 1988 work of vast scope anderudition.33He argued that the Hekhalot traditions developed as an unan-ticipated side track from third-centurycePalestinian sermons associatedwith the festival of Shavuot and connected particularly with R. Joshua benLevi in Caesarea. None of these sermons survive, but Halperin reconstructedwhat he regarded to be their basic content fromRe\"uot Ye ̇hezqel, homiliesof the contemporary church father Origen, and other Jewish midrashic andhomiletic sources. The basic exegetical strategy of these sermons was to con-nect Ezekiel’s vision of the Merkavah in Ezekiel 1 and 10 with the revelationof Torah on Mount Sinai in Exodus 19, this by way of Ps 68:18–19, which con-nected the divine chariotry with Sinai. The reference to an ascent in Psalm68 was developed into a myth in which Moses ascended to heaven, over-came angelic opposition, laid hold of God’s throne, and received the Torah tobring back to Israel. The connection between Psalm 68 and Ezekiel’s visionis attested in the Second Temple period in the ancient Greek translation (theSeptuagint) of Ezekiel and in the Songs of the Sabbath Sacri\bce from Qum-ran, so the third century Shavuot sermons were developing an old theme,through which they o\u0010fered a considerable exegetical payo\u0010f in opening thepossibility of learning more about the nature of the deeply enshrouded Sinairevelation through the details of Ezekiel’s mysterious vision.According to Halperin, the Hekhalot traditions developed when someexegetes carried elements of this myth to conclusions never anticipated by itsformulators. Its themes were combined with the myth of the ascent to heavenof the patriarch Enoch, producing the Hekhalot myth of the transformationof Enoch into the angel Metatron, to which the Moses ascent myth has manyparallels. The ascent of Moses also served as a paradigm for the Hekhalotpractitioners, who likewise ascend to the very throne of God and who likewise31Scholem,Major Trends, 42–43; idem,Kabbalah, 8–21. Cf.

The heavenly journey isthus no more than a fantasy that validates the theurgic rituals used by theHekhalot practitioners as a short-cut to gain both unearned knowledge ofTorah and the social status that accompanies such knowledge.Halperin acknowledged the possibility that some practitioners expe-rienced “hallucinations” corresponding to the visionary traditions in theHekhalot texts, but he regarded these as an unimportant by-product of whatwas ultimately a feat of exegetical creativity that produced the foundationmyth of the Hekhalot literature.34He noted that the ascent instructions intheHekhalot Zutartiend with the command to “recite this mishnah” (§ 419)and concluded that the Hekhalot practitioners thought it necessary only torecite accounts of the ascents of ancient worthies, not to embark on theirown ascents.35Without necessarily accepting Halperin’s entire reconstruction, Schäfer,Himmelfarb, and Michael D. Swartz agreed that the basis of the Hekhalottraditions was literary expression based on exegesis of scripture and thatthe heavenly journey was of secondary importance, probably mainly as a\bctional paradigm involving Tannaitic rabbis.36Halperin’s reconstruction of the exegetical undergirding of the Hekhalottraditions, while speculative in many respects, has many persuasive elementsand there may be much truth to it. The Hekhalot literature assumes a complexweb of scriptural connections that include not only Ezekiel’s vision, theSinai event, and Psalm 68, but also the Sinai vision of God on the sapphirepavement in Exod 24:9–11; Isaiah’s vision of God in chapter 6; the divinesilence of 1 Kgs 19:12; the camps of God in Gen 32:1–2; the vision of the Ancientof Days in Dan 7:9–10; the divine chariot and \bery angels of Ps 104:1–4; andthe earthly temple and temple cult of 1 Chronicles 28–29 as a template for thecelestial throne room and the angelic liturgy. These connections were alreadyin place in the Second Temple period.37Scriptural exegesis is fundamentalto any overarching explanation of the origins and meaning of the Hekhalotliterature.That said, although literary skill and exegesis are fundamental, they arenot su\u0010\bcient, and their importance should by no means lead us to dismissor downplay the experiential elements in the Hekhalot texts. Indeed, to drive34Ibid., 441.35Halperin, “A New Edition,” 549–551; idem,The Faces of the Chariot, 372–375.36Schäfer, “Aim and Purpose,” 294; Himmelfarb,Ascent to Heaven, 95–114; Swartz,ScholasticMagic.37Davila, “The Macrocosmic Temple.”"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"12chapter onea wedge between the two is to introduce a false dichotomy, a point that wasforcefully made by Elliot R. Wolfson.38Visionaries speak in the idiom of theirown culture and visions emerge from a particular cultural matrix. Any visionsor otherworldly journeys experienced by ancient Jews would necessarily beformulated according to Jewish tradition, including the vast background ofexegetical speculations about the heavenly realm. But entirely di\u0010ferent toolsare needed to understand the visionary and experiential elements of theHekhalot literature.Swartz made a promising start when he turned not to the experience of theHekhalot practitioners, which is not accessible to us, but to the rituals andpractices they used, which are.39But his focus is on the implications of thesepractices for the social location of the practitioners (on which see below) andhe accepts the false dichotomy between exegesis and experience. RebeccaMacy Lesses focuses on the performative and ritual aspects of the Hekhalotliterature and how they aim to use ritual power to accomplish certain goals.40She draws on the approaches of Stanley Tambiah on ritual as performance;J.L. Austin on speech-act theory; and Lawrence Sullivan on the hermeneuticsof performance, and uses these tools to analyze various types of adjurationsin the Hekhalot literature and related texts, with attention to their contextin the Jewish and other adjurational traditions of late antiquity (includingthe Greek Magical Papyri and Jewish magical and halakhic works). Shedemonstrates that these adjurations are formulated to be enacted, composedboth of e\u0010\bcacious words and of ritual actions intended to be performed.They are not merely literary refractions of an exegetical tradition.Along similar and complimentary lines, I have drawn on anthropologicalstudies of shamans and related intermediaries and has argued that theparadigm of the “shaman/healer,” a shamanic intermediary characteristicof agricultural societies, provides a pattern that organizes the seeminglyfragmented elements of the practices and practitioners of the Hekhalotliterature into an organic whole.41The ascetic techniques used by theHekhalot practitioners are similar to those used by shamans to achieveecstasy or a trance state. And the accounts of otherworldly journeys foundin the Hekhalot literature correspond in many ways to shamanic accounts ofotherworldly journeys induced by these trance states. In addition, both the38Wolfson,Through a Speculum that Shines, 119–124.39Swartz,Scholastic Magic, 25–26.40Lesses,Ritual Practices to Gain Power.41Davila,Descenders to the Chariot."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"introduction13Hekhalot practitioners and shamans experience an initiatory disintegrationand reintegration in which they are killed and brought back to life as beings\blled with spiritual power. Both concern themselves with control over spirits,and this aspect of their practices is the linchpin that holds their o\u0010\bcestogether. Both also use their powers to serve a human community.More recently, Schäfer has a wide-ranging analysis of the origins ofJewish mysticism in which he demonstrates the pervasive importance ofscriptural exegesis in some macroforms of the Hekhalot literature and inwhich he expresses considerable skepticism about any experiential visionarycomponent that might lie behind the texts.42The \brst point is undisputedand the second di\u0010\bcult to respond to directly, given that we have no accessto the subjective internal states of the long-dead composers of the texts. Thetreatment of the question of visionary experience in the book su\u0010fers from alack of attention to the issue of ritual praxis in the texts. The evidence thatthe Hekhalot texts concerned themselves with ritual practices that wereintended to be used by actual practitioners is overwhelming, so the questionbecomes whether some of those rituals were undertaken in order to generatevisionary experiences. I have argued, as summarized above, that some were.43In sum, our evidence indicates that although the Hekhalot traditionssurvive as literary compositions based on profound meditation on thescriptures, they also preserve evidence in some cases for the rituals and,arguably, even the experiences of real practitioners who actually used therituals prescribed in the texts. Schäfer and Halperin have noted evidence fora later or concurrent simpli\bcation of the rites in which recitation could besubstituted for carrying them out, but these are separate from and dependenton the rites themselves, which rites are designed actually to be performed.44It is clear also that one purpose of some of these rites was to cause thepractitioner to have certain experiences that we would characterize asvisionary or mystical. As I have suggested elsewhere,45the possible rangeof such experiences is very wide and should be viewed as a continuum: atthe weaker pole they might involve the exercise of the active imagination tovisualize themes and images that have been absorbed through meditation onthe scriptures, but the stronger pole could include trance states and deeplyaltered states of consciousness.42Schäfer,The Origins of Jewish Mysticism.43See my review ofThe Origins of Jewish MysticisminDSD19 (2012).44See Davila,Descenders to the Chariot, 302–304.45See n. 43."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"14chapter oneOrigins of the Hekhalot TraditionsA key question is whether the Palestinian rabbinic traditions of the Tannaiticera knew any early forms of the Hekhalot traditions. We have seen thatScholem took it that the Tannaitic references toma#aseh merkavahreferredto just such traditions, but Halperin challenged this position, arguing thatthe Hekhalot traditions evolved in response to third-century exegeticalhomiletics developed in Palestinian Shavuot sermons.Halperin’s position has also been challenged by comparative work doneby Christopher R.A. Morray-Jones and myself. Drawing especially on Genizaevidence, Morray-Jones has reconstructed a \brst-person version of the Storyof the Four Who Entered Paradise narrated pseudepigraphically by R. Akivawhich Morray-Jones \bnds to be stratigraphically earlier than the rabbinicversions and which has an unambiguous association with the heavenlyascent. The implication is that this version of the story, which has a mysticalrather than exegetical orientation, existed by late in the Tannaitic period.46In a later study he reinforces this conclusion with comparisons of theseand other traditions in theHekhalot Zutartito early Gnostic and Christiansources.47I have o\u0010fered support to his position by showing that one of theHodayot hymns from Qumran (1QHaxvi 4–26a), “the hymn of the garden,”also uses the image of the Garden of Eden as the celestial temple inhabitedby dangerous angels and also describes a sage who survives an assault bythe waters of chaos in the Garden, as well as another \bgure who damagesthe plants in the Garden. In other words, the mystical cosmology found insome versions of the Story of the Four already existed in the Second Templeera, which increases the probability that the original Story of the Four had amystical orientation and that this mystical cosmology may be behind someof the Tannaitic objections to study of the Merkavah.48Morray-Jones has also argued for extensive parallels between the Hekhalotliterature and the writings of the Apostle Paul.49And other connections46Morray-Jones, “Paradise Revisited (2 Cor 12:1–12).”47Idem,A Transparent Illusion.

TheSongs of the Sabbath Sacri\bce, the Berakhot, and the Songs of the Sageamong the Dead Sea Scrolls have many parallels in terminology, scripturalexegesis, and general interests to the Hekhalot literature. The Scrolls alsoshow some interest in heavenly ascents.50Andrei A. Orlov has argued thatthe book of2 Enoch, preserved in medieval Slavonic recensions (and recentlydiscovered Coptic fragments), presents a picture of the dei\bed Enoch whichis stratigraphically earlier than that of3 Enochand which may go backto traditions of the Second Temple era.51His relative dating of2 Enochinrelation to3 Enochis more convincing than his early absolute dating of2 Enoch.52The relationship between the Hekhalot texts and the early Jewish apoca-lypses is of interest as well. On the one hand, Himmelfarb has demonstratedthat the two groups of texts are generically quite di\u0010ferent: the apocalypsesgive \bctional narrative accounts of “raptures,” heavenly ascents to whichhuman visionaries are subjected without their taking any initiative, whereasthe Hekhalot texts give instructions to practitioners who seek to generatevisions (of heavenly ascents or descending angels) by means of adjura-tions and rituals.53On the other hand, I have shown that the early Jewishapocalypses (the collection in1 Enochand the books of Daniel,2 Baruch,and4 Ezra) overall contain signi\bcant structural parallels to the global pat-tern of shamanic features associated with the Hekhalot practitioners asargued inDescenders to the Chariot. These include the use of ritual andascetic techniques, traces of an initiatory disintegration and reintegration,the undertaking of otherworldly journeys, the control of angels, and the pro-viding of services to their community.54Whether the similarities are due to50L.

Ultimately, he \bnds that “the romantic quest for ‘origins’ has turnedout to be a futile and methodologically misguided exercise.” The diversityof the texts leads him to \bnd little commonality between them, apart fromthe aim to bridge the gap between our world and heaven where a lovingGod awaits, and he \bnds no discernible linear development leading from theearlier traditions to the Hekhalot literature.55In sum, there is a case for the ideas and practices found in the Hekhalotliterature being the result of a very long process of development, at leastsome of which goes back to the Second Temple period, although such earlyorigins are by no means universally accepted by specialists.Authorship, Provenance, and Social ContextThe question of who wrote the Hekhalot literature, why, and under whatcircumstances, also continues to be debated. Although it is widely acceptedthat some of the traditions go back to the late Tannaitic period, there is alsoagreement that an important stage of development took place in Babyloniain the Amoraic period. Halperin \bnds the earliest rabbinic evidence forthe association ofma#aseh merkavahwith heavenly ascents in a fourth-centuryceor later Babylonian context and Lesses and I have pointed toextensive parallels between the Hekhalot literature and the BabylonianAramaic incantation bowls of the \bfth to seventh centuries, parallels thatdemonstrate that some Hekhalot rituals and adjurations were used forpractical ends such as healing and exorcisms.56Schäfer suggested that thetexts are “an expression of how an elite post-Rabbinic group of scholarsunderstood the world and reality.”57Halperin has pointed to the hostility55Schäfer,The Origins of Jewish Mysticism, quotation on p. 354.56Halperin,The Faces of the Chariot, 362; Lesses,Ritual Practices, 351–362, 369–370; Davila,Descenders to the Chariot, 217–228.57Schäfer, “Aim and Purpose,” 294–295.

He has proposed that the Hekhalot literature was produced bythe#am ha\"arets, the common “people of the land,” an uneducated lowerclass mentioned with contempt in the rabbinic texts. Halperin suggeststhat the contempt was reciprocated and that, inspired by the myth ofMoses’ ascent in the Shavuot synagogue tradition, these people developedtheurgic methods that they convinced themselves gave them the power toacquire Torah learning e\u0010fortlessly rather than through years of painstakingstudy.58This theory has not been found convincing by other scholars. Rather, thereis more support for the case that the writers were literate people with someeducation but who were not members of the rabbinic movement. Swartzlooks to “synagogue functionaries, scribes, non-intellectual professionalreciters (tanna\"im), and a complex network of professions and social groups”with an aspiration to elitism characteristic of secret societies rather thanthe actual social elite of the time.59Lesses would “locate these texts withinthe larger world of Jewish learning, even if the exact placement is elusive.”They sought to combine traditional Jewish learning, including the Bibleand rabbinic and liturgical traditions, with the world of adjurations andincantations.60I argue that the shamanic practitioners behind the Hekhalotliterature were skilled scribes who were well educated in Bible and Jewishlegend and myth, although much less so in speci\bcally rabbinic traditions. Butthe evidence of the incantation bowls, some of which are badly copied or eveninscribed with meaninglessfaux-lettering, indicates that the early Hekhalottraditions were also extensively used by semi-literate and even illiteratepractitioners, perhaps embodying the radical egalitarianism promoted bythe Sar Torah traditions.61The composition of the Hekhalot literature may have begun before theAmoraic era, but it also continued for some time thereafter.

This format in turn was chosen as the best means of presentationfor the Hekhalot macroforms, given their nature. They are generally looselyredacted, without a clear overall plan and sometimes with little sense of orderat all; often their beginning and ending are not clearly or consistently markedinternally either within their own content or in the layout of the manuscripts;the text of some of the macroforms varies widely even among the completemedieval and later manuscripts, suggesting that no canonical form was everestablished; and the much earlier Geniza fragments sometimes confront us"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"introduction21with very di\u0010ferent and obviously better readings and even redactions thanthose of the late complete manuscripts, demonstrating that the texts contin-ued to be redacted for centuries after their original production. Presentationof these texts in synoptic format with diplomatic translations allowed Schäferand his colleagues to make them available while sidestepping many of thedi\u0010\bcult, if not intractable, problems with conceptualizing the texts that liebehind the manuscripts.72Despite its strengths, this approach has its weaknesses as well. To my mindit exaggerates some of the problems with the texts. Despite their variegatednature, close attention to the content of the macroforms usually makes theirtextual boundaries clear, and the later division markers in the manuscriptsare rarely signi\bcantly in con\u0000\u0002ict with such internally suggested bound-aries. Much of the recensional variation between the complete medievalmanuscripts consists of the addition in one or a few manuscripts (notablyN) of unrelated units that are often known from elsewhere and which are inany case easily isolated. It is true that even after discounting these additions,some of the macroforms survive in multiple redactions, but this fact can befactored into any text-critical reconstruction without a great deal of di\u0010\b-cultly. And, although it is true that the Geniza fragments show us that earlierforms existed of some of texts—and permit us to reconstruct at least bits andpieces of these earlier forms—the complete manuscripts clearly go back to acommon text, one apparently produced around the thirteenth century bythe ̇Haside Ashkenaz, and this text ought to be susceptible to reconstructionusing the normal canons of textual criticism.Moreover, it must be underlined that no single manuscript always gives thebest text of any of the macroforms, so to gain access to the earliest availableform of a macroform we must resort to an eclectic text-critical reconstructionof it. The conceptual and methodological di\u0010\bculties of the task do not permitus to evade it. I have argued this point in detail elsewhere, using as an examplethe Merkavah hymn inHekhalot Rabbati§ 253, which is nearly impenetrablycorrupt in any individual manuscript, but whose complex and beautiful text72Schäfer et al.,Übersetzung, vols. 1–4; Schäfer, “Tradition and Redaction”; idem, “Pro-legomena zu einer kritischen Edition und Analyse derMerkava Rabba”; idem, “Au\u0000\u0003au undredaktionelle Identität derHekhalot Zu ̇tarti”; “Zum Problem der redaktionellen Identität vonHekhalot Rabbati”; idem, “Ein neues Fragment zur Metoposkopie und Chiromantik”; idem,“Ein neuesHekhalot Rabbati-Fragment”; Halperin, “A New Edition of the Hekhalot Literature.”The debate between Schäfer and Chaim Milikowsky in the pages of theJournal of Jewish Studiesin the late 1980s regarding textual study of rabbinic literature also touched on the Hekhalotliterature: Schäfer, “Research into Rabbinic Literature,” esp. p. 149; Milikowski, “The StatusQuaestionis”; Schäfer, “Once Again the Status Quaestionis.”"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"22chapter onecan be reconstructed with a high degree of con\bdence by making use ofmultiple manuscripts.73Such examples could be multiplied. The passage onthe likenesses of Ezekiel’s four living creatures engraved on the throne ofGod inHekhalot Rabbati§ 273 and the description of the concentric ringsof spirits and wonders surrounding the throne inHekhalot Zutarti§ 356 areboth highly corrupt in the individual manuscripts but again can largely bereconstructed using textual criticism. Geniza fragments of the latter twopassages also give us access to some earlier and better readings than thosefound in the later complete manuscripts.This translation is of an eclectic critical text of the above-indicated macro-forms, reconstructed primarily from the texts of the complete manuscriptspublished in theSynopsealong with, for theHekhalot Rabbati, the textsof F and L. A reconstruction based on these manuscripts gives us a goodapproximation of the text edited by the ̇Haside Ashkenaz. This text madeuse of and to a signi\bcant degree preserved the earlier Geonic recensionsof the macroforms, but at times it did not understand the earlier text andat times it deliberately altered it. Misunderstandings, for example, occurredin the transmission of Greek phrases transliterated into Hebrew letters inHekhalot Rabbati§§ 230, 233, 236, 242, which now survive only as corruptnomina barbarain the manuscripts. The manuscript (or manuscripts) usedby the Ashkenazic redactors may itself have already been corrupt. An excel-lent example of a deliberate alteration to the earlier text is the addition of§§ 224–228 to the passage in theHekhalot Rabbatiin which R. Nehuniahben HaQanah instructs his followers on how to undertake a descent to thechariot. This passage is missing in a corresponding Geniza fragment and itboth misunderstands and changes the tenor of its interrupted context in theHekhalot Rabbati.I have aimed broadly to reconstruct the earliest recoverable text not only ofthe macroforms in general, but also of each individual microform. As alreadynoted, the Geniza fragments not infrequently allow us to recover a better textthan that preserved in the later complete manuscripts. The Geniza fragmentsthemselves are frequently quite corrupt, but with a di\u0010ferent pattern of errorsthan is found in the complete manuscripts. The use of both sometimespermits us to recover the text of individual microforms in a form closerto the otherwise lost Geonic recensions.Likewise, emendation occasionally permits us to reconstruct a better,otherwise lost reading (e.g.,Hekhalot Rabbati§§ 102 n. n; 158 n. y; 247 n. m;73Davila, “Prolegomena,” 210–214, 223–226."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"introduction23Sar Torah§ 281 n. j) and even perhaps to glimpse an earlier text that cannotbe fully recovered (e.g.,Hekhalot Rabbati§ 165 n. l andHekhalot Zutarti§ 357nn. h, j).When reconstructing individual microforms I have used all the availablemanuscript evidence, whether or not the manuscripts were of the samerecension. Thus, I do not distinguish between the readings of the long andshort recensions for theMa#aseh Merkavahor theMerkavah Rabbaand Itranslate the Story of the Four Who Entered Paradise, which appears in boththeHekhalot Zutartiand theMerkavah Rabba, one time in theHekhalotZutartialone, making use of all manuscripts from both macroforms. It ispossible that in some cases the result is that a slightly better—or at leastslightly di\u0010ferent—text is reconstructed for a given microform than ever wasfound in that particular macroform, but those interested in such \bne tuningof results can easily make such distinctions by examining the readings of theindividual manuscripts given in the critical apparatus. Readers who simplywant the best and most coherent texts of the works overall will \bnd it in thetranslation itself.The limitations of the eclectic critical texts translated here should notbe denied or downplayed. I am con\bdent that these texts are close to whatcame to us from the hands of the ̇Haside Ashkenazand sometime better,but I cannot claim either that theVorlagethat left their hands came to uswith a single canonical wording throughout or that, if such ever existed, Ihave reconstructed it.74Most of the time the overall sense of a passage can bereconstructed with a high level of con\bdence and even its speci\bc wordingto a fair level of detail. But in many individual cases one reading is no morelikely than another and one must be chosen for the translation. No doubtthere will be any number of cases in which other specialists will judge adi\u0010ferent reading than I did to be original, and the full range of evidence isgiven in the notes to facilitate such independent judgments and make suchconversations easier.Thus the exact wording of the text often remains at least slightly in doubt,and some passages remain stubbornly corrupt or at least incomprehen-sible—the arcane nature of some of the material sometimes makes it di\u0010\bcultto decide which. In the notes I have indicated when I judged readings to be74Dan raises the disquieting possibility that all surviving complete manuscripts of themajor Hekhalot macroforms go back a single European manuscript (“Hekhalot Texts in theMiddle Ages,” 92–93). If this is correct, a single such canonical version did once exist, but onlyby virtue of suppressing an earlier textual variety, bits of which have now been recovered inthe Geniza fragments."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"24chapter onecorrupt and I have sometimes pointed to a particular reading as clearly thebest, but there are also not a few cases in which a range of readings could beoriginal. In such cases the sense of the sentence or passage is generally notin doubt.This is as much as can be down with the evidence in our hands at present.Philological and exegetical advances in our understanding of the manuscriptsand their variants will doubtless provide some improvements in our textsand understanding of the material, although we should not expect enormousadvances from such approaches. We can only hope that future discoveriesof better and earlier manuscripts will help us to recover a better and earliertext.The text of theHekhalot Rabbatiseems to be recoverable overall with ahigh degree of con\bdence. The text is redactionally quite stable and additionsbelonging a later stratum are easily identi\bable. The Geniza evidence,however, indicates that the Geonic text has been subjected to some signi\bcantediting by the ̇Haside Ashkenazand we do not know how extensive thechanges were. A full collation of all the manuscripts is necessary before ade\bnitive evaluation of its text is possible. The text of theSar Torahcanalso be reconstructed with a high degree of con\bdence. The manuscriptsshow some degree of redactional variability, but a more original core textis not di\u0010\bcult to isolate. The individual microforms of theHekhalot Zutartiare frequently reconstructable with a fairly high level of con\bdence, butthe arcane nature of the adjurations often make reconstruction di\u0010\bcultand the lists of names often remain highly corrupt. This work has greaterredactional variability than either of the \brst two, but a core text can beisolated fairly con\bdently. Though perhaps not to the same degree as for theHekhalot Rabbati, the Geniza manuscript of theHekhalot Zutartigives usreason to believe that the Geonic text had some di\u0010ferences from the text ofthe later complete manuscripts. The text of theMa#aseh Merkavahcomesto us in two basic recensions (one of which has an addition in N, creatinga third recension). This recensional variety creates some complexities, butthe text of the individual microforms can usually be reconstructed (apartfrom divine names andnomina barbara) with a high degree of con\bdence.No Geniza fragments of this work survive. TheMerkavah Rabbais the mostdi\u0010\bcult macroform to reconstruct, both in terms of its wording and its overallstructure. Its textual base is the narrowest of all the major macroforms and itcomes to us in a long and a short recension, whose relationship remains to beclari\bed. Where it consists of straightforward narrative we can be reasonablycon\bdent of the text, but much of it consists of di\u0010\bcult adjurations, divinenames andnomina barbara, as well asShi#ur Qomahmaterial that had its own"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"introduction25life in other contexts. It seems likely that otherShi#ur Qomahmanuscripts andrecensions in\u0000\u0002uenced the transmission of the text in the manuscripts of theMerkavah Rabba. The overall shape of the text of this part of the macroformcan be reconstructed, but the speci\bc details are often irrecoverable. TheSar Panimalso comes to us in a narrow manuscript base, but the overallshape of the text and even its detail are recoverable with a good degree ofcon\bdence. That said, the Geniza fragment that preserves part of its openingparagraph is disquietingly di\u0010ferent from that of the full text we know.TheGreat Seal-Fearsome Crownis a brief text that seems to be well preserved andhas no redactional issues. No Geniza fragments of it survive.TheChapter of R. Nehuniah ben HaQanahsurvives in only one manuscript(V §§ 307–314), as do G8, G19, and G22. I have noted parallels in themwith other Hekhalot texts and have taken these into account where theyhelped to reconstruct the text. The brief textThe Ascent of Elisha ben Avuyah(§ 597) survives in only two manuscripts which have very few variations.I have translatedThe Youthtext from a single manuscript, but have takenthe readings of other manuscripts into account when they seemed useful.The general tenor of this text is clear, but its structure and wording varysigni\bcantly among the manuscripts.The Format of This VolumeChapters two through six each contain a translation of one major macroform.The introduction to each chapter gives basic information about the macro-form’s contents; surviving manuscripts of it; its title; important redactionalissues; its date of composition, provenance, and original social context; itsmajor theological themes; stories told in it; ritual practices described in it; andthe chapter, verse, etc. divisions applied to it in the manuscripts and in thistranslation. Each introduction concludes with a bibliography for the relevantmacroform. Chapter seven translates \bve shorter macroforms. Its introduc-tion provides some basic background and bibliography for each. Chaptereight translates all known fragments of the Hekhalot literature recoveredfrom the Cairo Geniza, including manuscripts of already-known macroformsand of otherwise unknown ones. The introduction to the chapter providesbasic information about each manuscript, some brief comments on themanuscripts published inGeniza-Fragmentewhich are not translated, andbibliography."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"26chapter oneThe Intended AudienceThis translation and its attendant notes are aimed in the \brst instanceat specialists who know Hebrew and Aramaic, who are familiar with theHekhalot texts and the secondary literature about them, and who can consultthis volume alongside theSynopseand theGeniza-Fragmente. The notes inthe critical apparatus will make full sense only to those readers. These textsare di\u0010\bcult and esoteric, and anyone who has limited background in Judaismand Jewish mysticism of late antiquity and the early Middle Ages will \bndthem challenging.Nevertheless, I have undertaken every e\u0010fort to make this volume acces-sible to specialists in cognate disciplines such as biblical studies, patristics,and medieval studies, who may or may not have the original languages andwho do not control the secondary literature. This is a translation, not a com-mentary, and most of the notes are text-critical or philological, but I havealso included some notes aimed at providing basic background informationand important discussions in the secondary literature and these should behelpful to nonspecialists.Lay readers may also bene\bt from this volume. They will gain the mostfrom the translations themselves and the background to them given in thischapter and the introductions to the following chapters. They also may \bndit useful to read introductory treatments such as Schäfer’sThe Hidden andManifest Godand the \brst chapter of myDescenders to the Chariotbeforetackling the texts themselves.Technical Translational IssuesThe critical apparatus notes variants that a\u0010fect the English translation, butother variants are generally not cited. For example, the presence or absenceof a proleptic su\u0010\bx is not indicated as a variant. That said, in many cases if avariant did not a\u0010fect the translation but still seemed of potential exegeticalinterest, I have noted it, although I have not done so with rigorous consistency.See, for example,Hekhalot Rabbati§§ 235 n. n and 276 n. q.The translation is in literal but idiomatic English. I have tried whereverpossible to re\u0000\u0002ect accurately the grammatical speci\bcs of the original Hebrewor Aramaic unless this resulted in grammatically poor English. The word-unitin the notes, however, is generally the relevant Hebrew or Aramaic word,which sometimes translates to two or three English words. For example aword in the construct state in the original languages would translate withthe addition “of.” So “the man” becomes “the man of ” and the note would beto the latter unit. Sometimes a whole phrase around a variant is quoted in"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"introduction27the notes because an original-language variant of a single word changes theEnglish translation of the phrase as a whole (e.g.,Hekhalot Rabbati§ 228 n. t;§ 234 n. c;Ma#aseh Merkavah§ 584 n. e).When possible a Hebrew root, whether a noun or a verbal form, istranslated throughout using the same English word, although I have allowedmyself some \u0000\u0002exibility to vary the translation as required by context andEnglish idiom. I have on a few occasions resorted to neologisms, as havethe Hekhalot authors. I have aimed to make the translation readable, butnevertheless, the style is repetitive and sometimes even awkward or stilted,but the same is often true of the style of the Hebrew and Aramaic of theHekhalot texts themselves.The manuscripts normally divide some of the macroforms into verses orchapters and verses. I have ignored these markers in the translation unlessthere was some speci\bc reason for taking note of them. (However, suchdivisions are included in the translations of the Geniza fragments in chaptereight.) Schäfer et al. have indicated all such markers for the manuscriptstranslated in theÜbersetzungvolumes. I have presented the texts of themacroforms according to the enumeration and paragraph divisions givenby Schäfer in theSynopse. I have also included the paragraph numbersassigned to theMa#aseh Merkavahby Scholem. In the introductions to theHekhalot Rabbatiand theSar TorahI have also included charts correlatingSchäfer’s paragraph divisions with Jellenik’s and Wertheimer’s chapter andverse divisions for these texts.In general my assumption is that readers working with the originallanguages will have theSynopseand theGeniza-Fragmenteto hand alongsidethis translation, so I do not cite the original Hebrew or Aramaic words behindthe translation in the notes unless they are needed to make some philologicalor text-critical point clear. But since the original text of F and L are not readilyavailable, for all unique readings in them for theHekhalot RabbatiI givethe text in the original language in transliteration parenthetically after thetranslation.The manuscripts used for the translation often include punctuationimplying a particular grammatical interpretation of a passage. I have ignoredall such punctuation unless there was a speci\bc reason for noting it, and allpunctuation in the translation is my own, based on the content and contextof the text itself. Catchwords at the beginning of a page in the manuscriptsare ignored. Likewise, orthographic (spelling) variations are not noted unlessthey raise some point of particular interest. Obviously corrupt readings thatdefy translation are ignored if they are the only variant for a given word orpassage. However, if a word or passage has multiple variants, only one of"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"28chapter onewhich is untranslatably corrupt, I give all variants in the notes, including atransliteration of this corrupt reading (e.g.,Ma#aseh Merkavah§ 549 nn. m,s, u, ll). If the corrupt reading is an obvious minor error for a reading thatmakes sense, I give it as the latter reading followed by “(!)” (e.g.,HekhalotRabbati§ 104 n. r; § 110 n. o). In the notes I have made every e\u0010fort to o\u0010fer atranslation of each reading in the manuscripts as long as it seemed possibleat all to translate it and even if it was clearly secondary or corrupt. Obviouscorruptions are \u0000\u0002agged as such. Although such secondary or corrupt readingsmake little or no contribution to the reconstruction of an original text, theyoften do give us useful information about the transmission of the texts andthe history of their interpretation.Abbreviations in the manuscripts are ignored and treated as the fullywritten word(s) unless there was a reason to do otherwise. The manuscriptsmake use of numerous abbreviations of the Tetragrammaton, the four-lettername of God. In chapters two through seven all these abbreviations arenormally transcribed simply as “YHWH” in the main text, although if thereading of an individual manuscript is given in either the main text or inthe notes, the actual abbreviation used is transliterated. Those interested inthe speci\bc abbreviations used for the divine name in all readings of all themanuscripts can \bnd them in the original in theSynopseand in transcriptionin theÜbersetzungvolumes. Abbreviations of the Tetragrammaton in theGeniza fragments are transliterated in chapter eight exactly as they appearin the manuscripts.Other divine names andnomina barbaraare normally transliterated in thetranslation according to the reading of O, unless O is unavailable, in whichcase the manuscript used is indicated in the notes. In cases where a moreoriginal formulation than that found in O can be reconstructed, the betterformulation is given in the translation, with the reasons for it explained inthe notes (e.g.,Hekhalot Rabbati§ 195 n. d; § 196 n. g;Hekhalot Zutarti§ 358n. p). To have given every variant of the Tetragrammaton, the divine names,and thenomina barbarawould have vastly increased the size and complexityof the notes, without providing any correspondingly better understanding ofthe texts.Most of the scriptural quotations and allusions cited in the translationwere \brst pointed out by Schäfer in the notes to his German translation. Afew come from others and I have added a few myself.Variants of de\bnite articles and conjunctions in the original are notconsistently noted unless they make a distinct di\u0010ference to the sense ofthe passage. Hebrew and Aramaic abstract nouns in the plural often havea concrete sense and hence are often translated as “acts of (noun)” or"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"introduction29“(adjective) acts,” for example “acts of righteousness,” “mighty acts,” “fearsomeacts,” “acts of holiness.” The biblical idiomr\"h b- (lit. “to see on”), which hasthe sense “to look in triumph on” or “to prevail over” (e.g., Ezek 28:17; Ps 112:8),is used in the Hekhalot texts from time to time of the descender to the chariotwho has braved the terrors of the descent and who now looks in triumph onthe wonders of the heavenly and divine vision, and of God likewise lookingon his creation. I have translated it throughout as “to feast the eyes on.” TheHebrew wordmiˇsnahcan mean, according to context, the Jewish scripture“the Mishnah” or a “mishnah” in the sense of a “tradition” or “recitation.” Ihave translated it in all four ways as appropriate in context. The Hebrewwordkavodhas the basic meaning “heaviness,” “weight,” and by extension,“glory.” The Aramaic termyaqarhas the basic meaning “value,” “worth,” butis sometimes used as a synonym forkavodin these texts, in which casesI have translated it as “glory.” The Hebrew root√br\"is translated with theappropriate form of the English word “create.” The Hebrew root√y ̇sr, whosebasic meaning is “to form,” but which is also used in the sense of “to create,”is translated throughout using the English word “form.” Thus the capitalizednoun “Former” is used with a meaning analogous to the word “Creator,” i.e.,the “One who Formed.” The phraseyo ̇ser bereˇsitis translated as “The Onewho formed primordial creation.” The nounberiyah, which is used in theHekhalot literature to refer to sentient beings, whether earthly or heavenly, istranslated as “being.” The nounye ̇suris translated as “formed being.” The nounmiddah, whose basic meaning is “measure,” has a wide variety of meaningsand is translated according to context as “measure,” “being,” “characteristic,”“consistency,” etc. The phrase “so-and-so” is not pejorative; it translates aHebrew term that means something like “\bll in the relevant name here.”A number of Hebrew letters are easily confused with one another, leadingto some common errors in copying. The preposition meaning “like,” “as,”“according to” (k-)is easily confused with the preposition meaning “in,”“at,” “on” (b-). The pronominal su\u0010\bx “my” or “me”(-y) is easily confusedwith the su\u0010\bx “his” or “him”(-w). And the letterwaw, which can mean“and” or the numeral “six” is easily confused with the letterzayin, whichcan represent the numeral “seven” or act as an abbreviation for the word“times.”The notes to the major macroforms in chapters two, four, and seveninclude variant readings from manuscripts of these macroforms from theCairo Geniza. In passages for which a Geniza text survives, lack of a citationof the Geniza manuscript in a text-critical note means that the reading inquestion is destroyed or too damaged for it to be deciphered. If a Genizareading is given within square brackets (e.g., “[G2]”), this means that the"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"30chapter onereading is destroyed but has been reconstructed on the basis of an estimateof the number of letters lost in that line. For full information on the Genizafragments of theHekhalot Rabbati, theHekhalot Zutarti, and theSar Panim,the translations of the fragments themselves in chapter eight and the relevanttext-critical notes in the apparatuses in chapters two, four, and seven shouldbe read together.5.ConclusionsThe Hekhalot literature is an important record of early Jewish mysticism, afascinating collection of exegetical traditions and ritual practices inspiredultimately by the prophet Ezekiel’s visions of the divine realm. The Hekhalotrituals were clearly used by spiritual intermediaries, some of whom calledthemselves “descenders to the chariot” and who today are often knownas “Merkavah mystics.” The clearest locus of the Hekhalot texts and thepractitioners who used them is Babylonia in late antiquity and the Geonicera, but the texts also incorporate both earlier and later traditions and sothey have a contribution to make to our understanding of Jewish mysticaltraditions and traditions of divine intermediation in earlier times, perhapseven as far back as the Tannaitic and Second Temple periods. As for the laterperiod, the Hekhalot literature was edited into its \bnal form in medievalAshkenazic circles and it continued to be transmitted and used throughoutthe Middle Ages and even into early modernity.Much work remains to be done on the text of the Hekhalot literature;its exegetical and poetic traditions; its rituals and their use; its origins;its life situation and authorship; its angelology and traditions of divineintermediation; and its reception history. This translation of central textsfrom the Hekhalot corpus is humbly submitted both as a tool for specialistsand a vehicle for wider study of the texts.BibliographyText Editions and ToolsAltman, Alexander. “Shire Qedushah be-Sifrut ha-Hekhalot ha-Qedumah.”Melilah2(1946): 1–24.

It is writ-ten in Hebrew with an Aramaic phrase or two and a few transliteratedGreek words and phrases. It is built around two stories set loosely inthe generation of the main players in the texts, Rabbis Ishmael, Akiva,and Nehuniah ben HaQanah, but the narratives themselves are mostlyor entirely legendary. The work includes an important account of a rit-ual praxis for traveling (“descending”) to the divine throne room. It is alsoreplete with merkavah hymns to be recited by various heavenly and earthlybeings.ContentsTheHekhalot Rabbatiopens with a passage extolling the surpassing greatnessof the descenders to the chariot (§§ 81–86, 91–93). A collection of songsof threefold holiness follows—Merkavah hymns that end by quoting theTrisagion of Isa 6:3 (§§ 94–106). Then comes a version of the Story of theTen Martyrs, a narrative set in the time of the Roman empire but likelycomposed in the Geonic era, many other versions of which survive1(§§ 107–121). Another collection of songs of threefold holiness follows (§§ 152–169),then a description of daily worship in heaven and its ties to earthly worship(§§ 170–174, 189–197). After this we \bnd a long account of a meeting ofthe mystical sages in which R. Nehuniah ben HaQanah gave them detailedinstructions for accomplishing the descent to the chariot, culminating withthe arrival of the adept at the throne of God, where he recites songs of praisealong with the throne itself. The section closes with accounts of two tests thatmust be passed by the adept while crossing the sixth palace (§§ 198–259).1These are collected by Reeg inDie Geschichte von den Zehn Märtyrern."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"38chapter two: introductionThe document concludes with a collection of Merkavah hymns (§§ 268–276)and a meditation on the names of the angel Metatron (§ 277).2ManuscriptsAltogether I am aware of twenty-two manuscripts of the complete macroformof theHekhalot Rabbatias described above, some of which contain addi-tional material (see under redactional issues below). Ten other manuscriptscontain material from the macroform.3In addition, there are seven highlyfragmentary manuscripts of theHekhalot Rabbatifrom the Cairo Geniza(G1–G6 and GO56).This translation is of an eclectic critical text reconstructed from the textof the seven complete manuscripts of theSynopse, along with two othermanuscripts that have been \u0000\u0002agged by Schäfer as particularly important andwhich were collated by him in his German translation. I have collated both ofthese from micro\blm copies provided by the Israel National and UniversityLibrary.FFlorence Laurenziana Plut. 44/13, an Italian manuscript dating to the fourteenthcentury, which presents the macroform as §§ 81–277, 281–306, 489–495. Thisunit is also preceded by another copy of §§ 297–334.4This manuscript preservesthe best overall text of theHekhalot Rabbatiof any of the manuscripts I haveexamined. It has a very high density of original readings, although only a veryfew of these are unique original readings. It thus appears to preserve a text veryclose to the one that left the hands of the ̇Haside Ashkenaz.LLeiden Or. 4730, an Italian manuscript that may date to the sixteenth orseventeenth century, which presents the macroform as §§ 81–277.5It stemsfrom a goodVorlagewith a high density of original readings, but it also containsa great many unique readings.

It seems that the text hasbeen substantially altered at some point for reasons that remain unclear.6The2Surveys of the contents of theHekhalot Rabbatiare given by Goldberg in “EinigeBermerkung”; Smith, “Observations”; Gruenwald,Apocalyptic and Merkavah Mysticism, 150–173; Schäfer,Übersetzung, 2:XXV–XXXII; and idem,The Hidden and Manifest God, 11–49.3See the lists of Boustan,From Martyr to Mystic, 38–47 and of Schäfer in “Handschriften,”201–218.

I hope to return in the future to the project of a complete criticaledition of theHekhalot Rabbati.TitleThe earliest surviving reference to the titleHekhalot Rabbatiis found in aneleventh-centuryresponsumwritten by Hai ben Sherira HaGaon, the head ofa Babylonian rabbinic academy. Theresponsumaddresses some questionssent to him about the Story of the Four Who Entered Paradise, and in hisresponse he refers to two works that he believed stemmed from the Tannaiticera, theHekhalot Rabbatiand theHekhalot Zutarti. His comments make clearthat he had a version of the text we call theHekhalot Zutarti, but unfortunatelynothing he says ties the titleHekhalot Rabbatito the text we have before usby that name.7Aside from Hai’s mention of the title, the only evidence we have for it isin two manuscripts of the work itself. It appears as the concluding title toa long recension in N § 335 and as the opening title in manuscript Warsaw877, fol. la. But numerous other titles are found in other manuscripts of thework, usually at its end. These include: “(the book of ) the palaces” ((sefer)hekhalot), “The book of the adjuration of the holy palaces” (sefer sheba#hekhleqodesh), “The palaces of R. Ishmael” (hekhalot de-R. Yisham#el), and evenhekhalot zutarti!8In short, we have some evidence for the titleHekhalot Rabbati, amongother titles, being applied to the work in question, and this usage may go7Theresponsumis published by Lewin inOtzar ha-Geonim, 4:13–15.

I retain the titleHekhalot Rabbatihereas a convention.Redactional IssuesTheHekhalot Rabbatihas clearly been composed by incorporating manyearlier traditions, but nevertheless it shows a signi\bcant degree of redactionaland textual integrity.9During the course of its transmission, some of itsmanuscripts have included other texts, but it is arguably possible to isolate thearchetype behind the surviving manuscripts. This is the unit described aboveunder “Contents,” consisting of §§ 81–277, minus a few obviously secondaryadditions.TheSar Torahtext (§§ 281–306, with most manuscripts omitting §§ 295–296 and §§ 304–305) is included in \bfteen of the complete manuscriptsas part of theHekhalot Rabbati, but it is missing in two and separated by acolophon in one. It also appears on its own in another manuscript. Its contentdeals with themes otherwise unknown in theHekhalot Rabbati. It clearly is aseparate document, added only secondarily to the larger macroform, and itis translated as a separate work in chapter three of this volume.Other texts are occasionally included either in the body of §§ 81–277 orafter it as part of the macroform. These includeThe David Apocalypse(§§ 122–126);Aggadat R. Ishmael(§§ 130–138 only in N);The Messiah Aggada(§§ 140–145, only in N); a fragment about Metatron’s intercession for repentantsouls (§§ 147–149, N//§§ 315–317 V); a fragment about the \brmaments ofthe universe (§ 150, only in N); a fragment about R. Ishmael intercedingwith God while making an o\u0010fering (§ 151, only in N); a fragment fromSederRabba di-Bereshit(§§ 175–188 or some part thereof ); a Sar Torah fragmentattributed to R. Ishmael (§§ 278–280//§§ 308–309//Merkavah Rabba677–679);The Chapter of R. Nehuniah Ben HaQanah(§§ 307–314, only in V);TheGreat Seal-Fearsome Crown(§§ 318–321//§§ 651–654); an Aramaic magicbook (§§ 489–495); and theApocalypse of Zerubbabel(not in theSynopse).109Goldberg, “Einige Bemerkungen.”10The relevant paragraphs are translated into German by Schäfer inÜbersetzung, vol. 2.For English translations of some of the texts, see Reeves, “Sefer Zerubbabel” and “\"Aggadatha-Maˇsia ̇h,” inTrajectories in Near Eastern Apocalyptic, 40–66 and 144–148, respectively.A translation of theDavid Apocalypseby Helen Spurling is forthcoming inOld TestamentPseudepigrapha: More Noncanonical Scriptures, vol. 1.

They were simply addedby accretion to individual manuscripts of the larger macroform, especiallyN. In addition, manuscript N uniquely and obviously erroneously closes themacroform one paragraph into theHekhalot Zutarti, at the end of § 335.The archetype §§ 81–277 contains the earliest reconstructable macroformfrom the complete Sephardic and Ashkenazic manuscripts and it is broadlysupported by the evidence of the much earlier Oriental Geniza manuscripts.The latter are highly fragmentary, but they do give us a signi\bcant samplingof an early text. At the same time, it is clear that the text of the archetypehas not reached us without some signi\bcant alterations, presumably by the ̇Haside Ashkenaz. Although the di\u0010ferent recension of hymns in G1 may notprove this—it may be an independent formulation of this hymns-complexor a secondary formulation excerpted from theHekhalot Rabbati, theSarTorah, and twoSar Panimtexts—the evidence of the Oxford Geniza fragment(GO56) is not so easily dismissed. The latter conclusively demonstratesthe secondary nature of the passage involving the recall of R. Nehuniahben HaQanah from his visionary descent (§§ 224–228), a passage alreadysuspect on redaction-critical grounds11but which appears in all the completemanuscripts.12I translate the earliest reconstructable archetype based on the indicatedmanuscript evidence, and I believe this evidence gives us a good approxi-mation of the text as edited by theHaside Ashkenaz. Moreover, I present theearliest recoverable texts of individual macroforms in the cases where we canget behind the text of the archetype (mainly with the help of the evidence ofthe Geniza fragments; see, for example § 273).Date, Provenance, and Social ContextThe earliest external evidence for the existence of theHekhalot Rabbatiisprovided by the Geniza manuscripts, two of which (G2 and G3) go back tothe eleventh century, roughly the same period as the possible citation by HaiGaon. If Hai knew some form of ourHekhalot Rabbati, it was old enough inare translated in chapter seven of this volume.Seder Rabba di-Bereshithas been translatedinto French by Séd in “Une cosmologie juive.”11Goldberg, “Einige Bermerkung,” 20–21; Dan, “Hekhalot Texts in the Middle Ages,” 92–93.12These paragraphs summarize arguments presented in greater detail in my article“Prolegomena,” 215–219. See also Schäfer, “Zum Problem.”"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"42chapter two: introductionhis time to be mistaken for a Tannaitic work. Likewise, if the hymn collectionof G1 is derived from theHekhalot Rabbati, the latter must be dated beforethe ninth century.Internal evidence points to a similar, if not earlier date of composition.Boustan has analyzed the martyrological themes in theHekhalot Rabbatiand the Story of the Ten Martyrs and has concluded that the former wascomposed in the eighth or ninth century, perhaps in Iraq. TheHekhalotRabbatisubverts the theology of the Story of the Ten Martyrs by transferringredemptive power from the martyrs to the descenders to the chariot, so thatthe actual su\u0010fering and death of martyrdom is no longer needed.13Scholem has argued for a still earlier date for at least some of the contentsof the work. Some of the hymnic material is closely related to Talmudic andother traditions going back to late antiquity, perhaps as early as the thirdcentury. And elements of the theurgic rites have parallels to Christian Gnosticmaterial of the second century. Since he sees no evidence that the Hekhalotliterature borrowed from any form of Christianity, Scholem argues that theChristian Gnostics and the Hekhalot traditions drew independently on earlierpagan rites. He also argues for a Palestinian origin for the ascent narrativeof R. Nehuniah ben HaQanah in theHekhalot Rabbati, based on referencestherein (§§ 214–215) to the topography of the environs of Jerusalem andCaesarea.14Smith likewise \bnds the in\u0000\u0002uence of traditions going back to lateantiquity and even to the \brst century.15In addition, Morray-Jones drawsparallels between traditions in theHekhalot Rabbatiand the letters of theApostle Paul which, if valid, would indicate that theHekhalot Rabbatiat leastdrew on ideas current in the \brst century.16Schäfer registers some skepticism about the Palestinian origins of thematerial based on the single passage in theHekhalot Rabbatiand he allows,like Boustan, for a considerable Babylonian in\u0000\u0002uence and later editing inEgypt, North Africa, and medieval Germany. He refrains from assigning theHekhalot Rabbatia date, but places it in the context of the Hekhalot literatureas a whole, which he dates to the sixth century or later.17That said, bothhe and Boustan recognize that some material in this work, particularly thehymnic traditions, may come from the third to the sixth century.13Boustan,From Martyr to Mystic, 278, 287–288, 291–293.14Scholem,Jewish Gnosticism, 21–35.15Smith, “Observations,” 150–160.16Morray-Jones, “Paradise Revisited,” 272–277.17Schäfer,Übersetzung, 2:XX–XXV; idem,The Origins of Jewish Mysticism, 244–245;Boustan,From Martyr to Mystic, 292."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"hekhalot rabbati43These conclusions hold well for theHekhalot Rabbati, as well as most ofthe other Hekhalot texts. This work was composed in the Geonic period,but drew extensively on late antique traditions, and it continued to undergoredaction and editing into the Middle Ages. The parallels to earlier materialfrom the second and \brst centuries put forth by Scholem and Smith applyas well to similar traditions from late antiquity, so I see little need to \bndsuch early traditions in the work. The parallels between theHekhalot Rabbatiand Paul adduced by Morray-Jones are not extensive and may suggest anearlier origin for some of the material, but the case cannot be regarded asconclusive. The question of the relative dates of theHekhalot RabbatiandtheHekhalot Zutartiwill be taken up in the introduction to chapter three.Relatively little can be said with con\bdence about the social contextof theHekhalot Rabbatibeyond what has already been said in chapterone about the Hekhalot literature in general. The paragraphs extolling thegreatness of the descenders to the chariot (§§ 81–86, 91–93) present them aspowerful magico-religious practitioners with a preeminent status in theircommunity, but one may suspect that this self-description involved a gooddeal of wishful thinking. Likewise, the practitioners are presented in theStory of the Ten Martyrs (§§ 107–121) and the account of R. Nehuniah benHaQanah’s instructions for the descent to the chariot (§§ 198–259) as aconventicle of mystics who met secretly to share information, but thesesections show little evidence of any historical basis. Ira Chernus has madethe case that a central redactional theme of theHekhalot Rabbatiis thatthe practitioner acts as an intermediary between the heavenly and earthlyrealms by passing information both ways.18As argued in chapter one aboutthe Hekhalot literature in general, the writer or writers of this work wereliterate and well educated in Bible, and with some exposure to rabbinictraditions, and they describe ritual practices that were intended to be used.Theological ThemesGod appears in theHekhalot Rabbatias the exalted and enthroned King ofthe universe. Two objects in the divine throne room receive special attention.The \brst is the throne itself, which has bound under it the four living creatures(who come out to play with God at the times of prayer) (§§ 100, 103, 172–173,189). Angels sing its praises (e.g., in §§ 94–105); reaching it is a major objectiveof the mystical descent to the chariot (§ 229, 235); and the throne itself singshymns to God which are echoed by the successful descender to the chariot18Chernus, “Individual and Community,” 254–259."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"44chapter two: introduction(§§ 162, 250, 251–257//§§ 260–266). The second object is the robe that Godwears on his own person, which emanates the stars and constellations (§ 105)and the mere gazing at which incinerates the visionary (§§ 102, 253).Angels are also important. In the heavenly throne room we \bnd biblicalangels, including the living creatures, the cherubim and ophannim (e.g.,§§ 100–103, 245–247), and, surprisingly only in two hymns (§§ 268–269), theseraphim. Ezekiel’s mysterious Hashmal \bgures in a test in the sixth palace(§ 258; cf. § 198). Suriah, the Prince of the Presence, and Samma\"el, the eviltutelary angel of Rome, are important players in the narrative about the tenmartyrs. There is an extensive account of the guardian angels of the entrancesto the seven palaces in §§ 204–243, 248. The exalted angel#Anaphi\"el, whocomes perilously close to being worshipped in heaven, also has a notablerole (§§ 210, 241, 244–245, 247–248). The Angel of the Presence (§ 100) andthe high angel Metatron (§ 277) are also mentioned brie\u0000\u0002y. The Shekhinah,God’s visible presence on earth, is mentioned a number of times (§§ 154, 156,158, 198, 247).On at least one level the divine realm and the human realm are merged, inthat there is a concord between the earthly worship of God and his heavenlyworship, described in some detail in §§ 170–173, 189–197. The individualpractitioners, should they survive the perilous gauntlet of entrance-guardingangels, the tests in the sixth palace (§§ 258–259), and the transformationalobliteration of the sight of God himself (§§ 101–104, 159) are obliged to returnto the earthly realm and bear witness to Israel of all that they have seen(§§ 163–164, 169; cf. § 216).19StoriesThe frame of the individual paragraphs in theHekhalot Rabbatiis consistentlya narration by R. Ishmael. Two speci\bc stories are told in the work. The \brst isa retelling of the Story of the Ten Martyrs in which the Hekhalot practitionersbecome the heroes of the narrative (§§ 107–121). The second is the accountof R. Nehuniah ben HaQanah’s teaching concerning the praxis of the descentto the chariot (§§ 198–259). TheHekhalot Rabbatimentions far more rabbisby name than any other Hekhalot text: four in § 107 (with ten in a variantin § 109) and ten in § 203. R. Nehuniah and R. Hananiah ben Teradyon areplayers in the \brst story, as are R. Akiva (in the addition in § 226) and thePatriarch Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel (§ 238) in the second.19For a detailed discussion of the major theological themes in theHekhalot Rabbati, seeSchäfer,The Hidden and Manifest God, 11–49."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"hekhalot rabbati45As already noted, it is very di\u0010\bcult to \bnd any historical basis for eitherstory. The \brst is \blled with obviously legendary miraculous elements; thereis no record of such plagues being visited on Rome; and there was neveran emperor named Lupinus with a wife named Ripa. It is chronologicallyimpossible for the meeting of the named characters in the second story tohave occurred in a room in the Temple precincts, since their\u0000loruitwas inthe second century, long after the Temple was destroyed.Ritual PracticesTwo main types of ritual praxis are presented in theHekhalot Rabbati. First, itcontains an extensive corpus of Merkavah hymns—hymns mostly ostensiblyrecited by heavenly beings: the songs of threefold holiness in §§ 94–106,152–169; songs recited by the angels and God in §§ 173, 190–195, and songsrecited by the throne of God in §§ 251–257//§§ 260–266. But it remains clearthat these songs were also intended for human use. In § 94 we are told thatthe \brst collection of songs of threefold holiness are recited by a man whodescends to the chariot, and § 106 informs us that R. Akiva learned the songswhen he stood before the throne of God. The main theme of the sectioncomprising §§ 170–173, 189–197 is the congruence and harmony betweenthe quotidian heavenly and earthly worship. And § 251 informs us that thepractitioner recites the hymns of the throne upon reaching the throne itself.The Merkavah hymns in §§ 268–276 are not attributed to any particularreciter, so we may take them too to have been used by the practitioners. Theoverall message of the text is therefore that the Hekhalot practitioners recitedthese hymns as part of their ritual journeys to the heavenly world.The second main praxis is the one given in the name of R. Nehuniah benHaQanah in §§ 198–248, which involves the adjuration of Suriah, Princeof the Presence, one hundred and twelve times, once for each guardianangel on the departing descent to the chariot and once for each on thereturning ascent, each adjuration being counted on the \bngers so thatno angel is omitted (§§ 204–205). The names of each guardian angel andthe names of the “seals” (magical names) to be recited to pacify eachare given in the remainder of the unit. Again, this praxis is presented inpractical terms as something to be used, and we have no reason to doubtthat it was used by actual practitioners.20Within this section (§§ 238–243)20I have discussed the ritual use of these songs and words of power in the cross-culturalcontext of shamanism inDescenders to the Chariot, 87–93, 115–124.

But earlier discussions frequently cite the work according to thechapter and verse divisions of the two earlier editions of the work by Jellinekand Wertheimer. Since the publication of theSynopsethese editions havebeen only of historical interest, but in order to facilitate the use of thesecondary literature that cites the text according to them, I have providedbelow in the appendix a chart giving the correspondences between thevarious text-division numberings in the three editions. As noted in chapterone, the manuscripts of theHekhalot Rabbatieach give their own chapterand verse divisions, but these are not noted in this translation unless theyraise some point of particular interest.BibliographyHebrew Texts of theHekhalot RabbatiJellinek,Bet ha-Midrash, 3: xx–xxv, 83–104.Schäfer et al.Synopse, §§ 81–277.Schäfer,Geniza Fragmente, 9–85 (G1–G6)Schäfer, Peter. “Ein neuesHekhalot Rabbati-Fragment.” (GO56)Wertheimer.Batei Midrashot, 1:63–112.Translations of theHekhalot RabbatiAlexander, Philip S.

Thelatter group is speci\bed as “the ones who descend to the chariot without authority,” theimplication being that there are those who descend to the chariot with authority and otherswho do so without authority. But it is not the unauthorized descenders to the chariot whomthe angels attack, but rather this other group “from the descenders to the chariot.” In lightof R. Nehuniah’s explanation, I take the preposition “from” to have the sense of origination:the amanuenses whom the angels attack are appointed by and therefore originate fromthe descenders to the chariot, but they themselves do not belong to this group. They werenot vetted with the same stringent standards and as a result they were found tragicallyunworthy when exposed, even indirectly (and in a sense not entirely clear) to the dangersof the visionary descent to the chariot."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"116chapter two: textThe instructions for the descent through the sixth and seventh palaces(§§ 229–237)§ 229/cf.GO56When you come and stand at the entrance of the sixth palace, showathreeseals of the guardians ofbthe entrance of the sixth palace to Qa ̇spi\"el,ctheprincedwhose sword isedrawn in his hand and lightningbolts dripfand goforth from it.gAnd it was roused againsthanyone whoiis not \bt to gaze atthe King and the throne.jAnd there is no being who stayskhis hand, andhis swordlcries out and it says,m“Ruin!”nAnd he standsoin the lintel to theright.p§ 230/cf.GO56And show one seal toaDumi\"el.bIs his name indeed Dumi\"el?

The instructions for the praxis are preceded by storiesthat purport to tell how God chose, in the face of angelic opposition, toreveal it to the Judean exiles when they returned from Babylon to rebuild theTemple. The text is written in Hebrew.ContentsThe text opens with a paragraph attributed to R. Ishmael, citing R. Akivain the name of R. Eliezer, asserting that the true power of Torah was notrevealed until the time of the Second Temple (§ 281). There follows a dialoguebetween God and Israel in which Israel reproaches God for imposing troublesand toils on them which interfere with their study of Torah. God acceptstheir reproach, commends their desire to learn Torah, and o\u0010fers them a“seal” and a “crown”, the proper use of which will eliminate the uneducatedfrom Israel and will grant the users great bene\bts that are the envy of theangels (§§ 282–291a). An angelic chief then protests the unfairness of thisarrangement, but God rebukes the angels and rea\u0010\brms his determinationto grant these powers to Israel (§§ 291b–294). Then R. Ishmael, citing thesame authorities, relates a tradition about a vision of the (macrocosmic?)Temple granted to the fathers at the site of the destroyed Temple, duringwhich vision the praxis of the Prince of Torah was revealed (§§ 297–298).The praxis itself is given in §§ 299–303, again in the name of the samerabbis (although this time the second one is called R. Eliezer the Great).A few manuscripts include an episode, again narrated by R. Ishmael in thename of the same authorities, in which the praxis is tested by these three"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"160chapter three: introductionrabbis in the Land of Israel and in Babylonia (§§ 304–305). Two prayersconclude the work (§ 306).1ManuscriptsTheSar Torahmacroform is included as part of theHekhalot Rabbatiin\bfteen manuscripts. In addition, it appears after theHekhalot Rabbatiin V,but separated from it by a colophon and thus understood to be a separatework. It appears as a separate work not associated with theHekhalot Rabbatiin one manuscript, London Harley 5510. Parts of the work also appear inF (§§ 297–306, before and §§ 281–306 after theHekhalot Rabbati); Parma1287/1 (§§ 281–298); and London Add. 15299 (§ 299–306).This translation is of an interim eclectic critical text reconstructed fromthe text of the seven complete manuscripts of theSynopseand which doesnot take into account any of the other manuscripts. The degree to whichtheir evidence would improve the reconstructed text must remain an openquestion pending a full collation of them.2TitleThe manuscripts of theHekhalot Rabbatiwhich include theSar Torahreckonit as part of theHekhalot Rabbatiin their chapter and verse enumerationsand give it no special title of its own. Manuscript Parma Cod. 1287/1 (de Rossi2239) includes § 281–298 and uses the phrasesod torah(“secret of the Torah”)at the beginning and end of the unit, also describing it as chapter 27 frompirqe hekhalot. London British Library Add. 15299 contains §§ 299–306 andindicates that it was copied fromsefer hekhalot. Thus in both cases thesepassages were extracted from a longer text, presumably theHekhalot Rabbati,since bothpirqe hekhalotandsefer hekhalotare titles used in of that workin complete manuscripts of it and chapter 27 begins theSar Torahin somechapter reckonings of the larger work. London Harley 5510 divides the workinto \bve chapters but gives it no title.The title ́sar torahmarks the beginning of the unit §§ 281–306 in V andthis unit concludes with the title ́sarˇsel torah. Both phrases mean “The Prince1Surveys of the contents of theSar Torahare given by Goldberg in “Einige Bermerkung,”35–39; Smith, “Observations,” 147–148; Gruenwald, “Hekhalot Rabbati,” 169–173; Schäfer,Übersetzung, 2:XXXI–XXXII; and idem,The Hidden and Manifest God, 49–53.2See Schäfer, “Handschriften,” 201–208; idem,Übersetzung, 2:XVI–XVII; Davila, “Pro-legomena,” 216–217.

They do not bring us any closer to the original text."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"sar torah161of Torah.” Thus the title ́sar torahis used in only one manuscript, but thatmanuscript treats the text as a separate work on its own terms. It should alsobe noted that in the manuscriptssod torahis often given as a variant for ́sartorah(see the text-critical notes), so the two titles are closely related.3We have no way of knowing which, if any, title was originally assigned tothe work. I retain the titleSar Torahhere as a convention.Redactional IssuesThe main text of theSar Torahnaturally divides itself into two distinctepisodes: the story of the revelation of the praxis at the time of the rebuildingof the Temple (§§ 281–294) and the praxis itself (§§ 297–303, and perhaps§ 306). The episode involving the testing of the praxis found in §§ 304–305 isfound only in M22, V, B, and twice in F. These three episodes are all presentedas quotations of R. Ishmael in the names of R. Akiva and R. Eliezer. Thepassage in §§ 295–296 is clearly a secondary addition. It is found only in B(with a parallel with N in §§ 405–406); both paragraphs are attributed toR. Akiva and they deal with Metatron and the heavenly throne room.The most stable redactional unit is §§ 281–294, 297–303, 306. Thismacroform is primarily interested in the revelation of a special ritual praxisthat makes the study of Torah vastly easier. This is a theme entirely foreignto theHekhalot Rabbatiand we are justi\bed in regarding thisSar Torahtextto be a work independent of the larger document. But there is some reasonto believe that theSar Torahmacroform is itself a composite document. Theconcluding paragraph, § 306, is attributed only to R. Ishmael and consistsof two prayers that have no connection with the theme of the rest of themacroform and which includes material known elsewhere from § 153, G1, andG8. It may be a secondary accretion to the macroform. Moreover, Swartz hasadvanced some reasons to regard §§ 281–294 and §§ 297–303 as originallyseparate compositions. According to his reading, in §§ 281–282 we are toldthat the praxis was not revealed until the Second Temple was built, whereas§ 297 asserts that the Second Temple was built only after the fathers hadcompelled God to reveal the praxis. The text of § 297 is in doubt and I haveadopted another reading, but even so the two passages appear to disagreeon whether praxis was revealed before or after the building of the Temple.The style and vocabulary of the two units are also somewhat di\u0010ferent andthe second unit stands on its own without reference to the \brst.43For details see Schäfer, “Handschriften,” 184–185, 201–208, 212–213.4See Swartz,Scholastic Magic, 105–106; Davila,Descenders to the Chariot, 274."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"162chapter three: introductionAs for the microform §§ 304–305, it \bts well in the context of theSar Torahmacroform, but its absence from most of the manuscripts is suspicious. Itstext has some relationship to early material in G8 (see below), so it maybe an independentSar Torahtradition incorporated secondarily into thismacroform.Date, Provenance, and Social ContextSomething similar to ourSar Torahmacroform was known in the early tenthcentury by the Kairite author Salmon ben Yeruhim, so some version of itmust have existed by then.5No fragments of the macroform have yet beenrecovered from the Cairo Geniza, but in the eleventh century manuscript G82b 21b–22a we read:R. Ishm[a]el said:The thing was done by my hand but I did not believe it until the thing wasdone by the hand of a certain [di]sciple who was the most inferior of us all inthe association.This sentence parallels the language of a sentence in § 305, but the contexts ofthe two sentences are quite di\u0010ferent. The “thing” accomplished in § 305 is thesuccessful application of the Sar Torah praxis by the dull practitioner, whereasin G8 it is the praxis of the ascent to the chariot, about which R. Ishmael isexhorted to testify in the immediately following context. Thus the sayingmay be a conventional one in Hekhalot traditions, but its use in these twovery di\u0010ferent passages does not imply a literary relationship between them.Although no other verbal parallels are extant in earlier material, the themeof the Prince of Torah is itself very early. G8 contains a section with the title“The Prince of Torah that belongs to it” (2b 24b; cf. 2b 34b–37a). Earlier still,three Aramaic incantation bowls from roughly the seventh century preservean incantation that mention the Prince of Torah. In it the house of a clientis sealed in the names of various mighty angels, including “and with theseal-ring of mighty Michael, the Prince of Torah.”6In another bowl God or anangelic prince is mentioned “whose [To]rah of mercy is placed in my mouthand all of [his] (or [my]) ways are law,” hinting at the Sar Torah theme ofTorah knowledge being given directly to a practitioner.75The relevant passage in Salmon’sBook of the Wars of the Lordis translated and discussedby Halperin inThe Faces of the Chariot, Appendix VII, pp. 518–522.6Gordon’s bowls E and F, with a parallel in a bowl published by H. Hyvernat. For detailssee Davila,Descenders to the Chariot, 220–222.

Although his theory has not been found convincing,it is more widely accepted that the Hekhalot literature came from scribalcircles who knew the Bible and some rabbinic traditions but who had noformal rabbinic training and who may indeed have envied the superior powerand social status of the rabbis. In addition, use of the Sar Torah practices mayhave been disseminated into a broader social context in accordance with theradical egalitarianism advocated by the traditions.8That said, it is unclearwhether the “Israel” to whom the praxis is to be revealed refers to the Jewishpeople as a whole or to the Hekhalot practitioners alone.9Moulie Vidas has argued in a recent doctoral dissertation that the author(s)of the Sar Torah text and perhaps other Hekhalot traditions were associatedwith the group referred to in hostile terms by the Babylonian Talmud asthe “reciters” (tanna\"im). These “reciters” were “known from other sourcesas those entrusted with the memorization, transmission and recitation ofrabbinic traditions in educational and ritual contexts.”10Converging lines of evidence point to a Babylonian connection andperhaps origin for the Sar Torah traditions. The praxis was tested in bothPalestine and Babylonia according to § 305 (which, however, as already noted,is likely to be a secondary addition to ourSar Torahmacroform); G8 includesa cryptic reference to a future sage, presumably a Hekhalot practitioner, inBabylonia (2a 12b–23a); and the earliest references to the Prince of Torahcome from Babylonian incantation bowls. So Sar Torah themes go back toseventh century Babylonia, although ourSar Torahmacroform may be muchlater and may have been composed and edited elsewhere.Theological ThemesTwo theological themes stand out in theSar Torahtext. The \brst is theemphasis on the idea of the ritual praxis being a gift of God to humanity.Remarkably, God admits that he “did not act rightly” (§ 283) in bringing theExile upon Israel. He now recognizes Israel’s enthusiasm for Torah study and8For an overview of the issues, see the introduction to this volume.

Theyrecognize that this praxis gives a supernatural power to human beings whichblurs the distinction between them and the angels. The hostility of the angelsto the revelation of Torah to human beings is a longstanding theme in rabbinicliterature, but theSar Torahtext makes the issue not the revelationper se,but rather the magical rite that allows mortals to assimilate knowledge ofthe divine gift of Torah without e\u0010fort.11StoriesThe stories in theSar Torahtext consistently function as advertisementsfor the power and e\u0010\bcacy of theSar Torahpraxis prescribed in the text.Two stories appear in the main macroform, each placed in the mouth ofR. Ishmael, who in turn quotes R. Akiva in the name of R. Eliezer. The\brst is an account of dialogues of God with Israel and then with “the chiefprosecutor of the attending angels,” emphasizing the wondrous nature ofthe praxis, which even the angels envy. The second tells of the appearanceto the fathers of a vision of the Temple on the site of its ruins and thesubsequent revelation of the Sar Torah praxis, apparently mediated by thebiblical character Zerubbabel ben Shealtiel. This narrative draws on the bookof Haggai for its context and some of its themes, and it underlines the divineorigin of the praxis.One could perhaps regard the revelation of the Sar Torah praxis itself,again attributed to the same succession of rabbis, as a story, but it seemsbetter to consider it under ritual practices below. One more story (§§ 304–305) is found in a few manuscripts. It too is attributed to the same successionof rabbis, but unlike any of the previous episodes, all three are actual playersin the events. R. Eliezer tested the praxis successfully, whether on himself oranother is unclear; then R. Ishmael likewise tested it, and then did so then ona “dullard” and on uneducated shepherds, again successfully; but its e\u0010\bcacywas not accepted as proven until R. Akiva left the Land of Israel, traveled toBabylonia, and applied it successfully to a multitude of uneducated people.The point of the story is clearly that the praxis is universally reliable: it canbe used on the dullest student and is equally e\u0010fective in Israel and in impureforeign lands.11These themes are discussed in more detail by Schäfer inThe Hidden and Manifest God,49–53; idem, “Engel un Menschen”; and idem,Rivalität zwischen Engel und Menschen."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"sar torah165Ritual PracticesThe centerpiece of this macroform is the ritual praxis presented in §§ 299–303 and 306. It combines ascetic practices with the recitation of traditions,divine names, and prayers. The practitioner must purify himself, isolatehimself for a twelve-day period, and observe certain dietary restrictions.During this period he must recite “this midrash of the Prince of Torah” alongwith his normal prayers and he must study it throughout each day. Thespeci\bc content of the midrash is not indicated, but is presumably someor all of the preceding narrative in §§ 281–294, 297–298, functioning as anhistoriolaor a story whose recitation provides a paradigm to empower anincantation.12In addition the practitioner must recite a series of angelicnames as adjurations. Two of these names,\"ZBWG\"and ̇SWR ̇TQ, are referredto respectively as “a great seal” and “a fearsome crown.” These terms areused elsewhere in the Hekhalot literature, most notably as a title for theincantation prayers found in §§ 318–321//651–654, translated in chapterseven. The Sar Torah praxis may or may not have this particular set ofadjurations in mind; the terminology may be traditional and its applicationhere independent of other uses. Paragraph 306 directs the practitioner tobegin the Sar Torah praxis by standing and praying two prayers, both of whichare known from elsewhere.The stated objectives of the Sar Torah praxis in § 303 are far-ranging: “hewill go forth to all the principles of Torah that he seeks, whether to Bible orto Mishnah or to the vision of the chariot.” In other words, both the powerof instant Torah-learning and the visionary journey to the chariot are inview, a combination that weakens scholarly e\u0010forts to separate the Sar Torahtraditions from traditions about descent to the chariot. This is not an isolatedcase of the mixing of these traditions: as noted above, a vision of what seemsto be the supernal Temple is associated with the revelation of the Sar Torahpraxis in this macroform in §§ 297–298 and terminology used for the testingof the Sar Torah praxis in § 305 is used in G8, but applied to the visionaryascent and descent.13Paragraph, Chapter, and Verse DivisionsThis translation of theSar Torahmacroform is numbered according to itsparagraphing in theSynopse.

Swartz accepts the majority reading “that lasts” (see n. n above), whichhe translates as “that stands,” and he translatesmydhas “punishment” and “retribution”(Scholastic Magic, 94; cf.

But the exile in question was not eternal and the narrative context concerns Jewswho had returned from it to the Holy Land, so this seems an unlikely concession on God’spart. I accept the negated verb in M40 as original and take the sentence as concessive in adi\u0010ferent sense. The setting is a few years after the end of the Babylonian Exile and, althoughit didnotlast forever, God acknowledges that it has become a source of longstanding strifethat is counterproductive to Torah-study and so he acknowledges the legitimacy of Israel’scomplaint.v“you reproached” N O M22 V B ] “you were compelled” (corrupt) M40 Dw“You” N M22 V B ] “You yourselves” O M40 Dx“your reproach” O M40 M22 V B ] “yourwhole reproach” N; “their reproach” D§ 284aParagraphs 284–294 are translated byMaier, “‘Gezetz’ und ‘Gnade,’ ” 104–109.b“the groaning of Israel is sweet” N M22 D VB ] “O groaning of Israel, you are sweet” O; “O grief of Israel, you scorch” (corrupt) M40c“craving for” O M40 M22 D V B ] “craving” Nd“has covered” N M22 D V B ] “you havecovered” O; “you (pl.) have covered” M40e“Me” N M40 M22 D V B ] “Him” Of“havefound favor” N O D V ] “give favor” M40; “guide” M22; “are restful” Bg“the sayings of ” NO M40 M22 V B ] “the words of ” Dh“My choosing” N O M40 M22 V B ] “His choosing” D§ 285a“I am” N O M40 D V ] om M22 Bb“wonders” O M40 M22 D V B ] “mighty acts”Nc“am I” N〈O〉M22 V B ] “the Lord” {O}; “is my Father, my Father” M40 Dd“Mightyacts throng forth” N M22 V B ] “He is the Owner of mighty acts, they throng forth” O M40 De“Who” (“And who” O V) M40 M22 D B ] “From” (?) or “Who” (Aramaic) Nf“has greetedMe \brst” O M40 M22 D V B ] “have greeted Me \brst” (3rd. pl.)

Its text and original form (insofar as we can speak of the latter) aremore di\u0010\bcult to reconstruct than for some of the other Hekhalot texts, butare recoverable to a signi\bcant degree.ContentsThe contents of theHekhalot Zutartiare varied and are di\u0010\bcult to summarize.The \brst part (§§ 335–375) has a special interest in divine names and their usein adjurations. The work opens with introductory material issuing obscurewarnings about the dangers of the practices taught therein (§ 335), followedby brief references to ascents by Moses and R. Akiva (§§ 336–337). A textuallycomplex account of the Story of the Four Who Entered Paradise follows(§§ 338–345). Various aspects of the ascent to the chariot and the vision ofGod are then discussed: an ascent of R. Akiva (§§ 346, 348); an account ofthe formidable powers of the practitioner (§§ 349–350a, paralleled in § 361);and an arcane discussion of whether a mortal can see God and live (§ 350b–352). Next comes a detailed description of the four living creatures in theheavenly throne room (§§ 353–356), followed by a series of revelations ofdivine names and incantations (§§ 357–367). Then we \bnd another detailedaccount of the environs of the divine throne, called “The Throne Midrash” byMorray-Jones (§§ 368–375). The second part of the work (§§ 407–426) turnsto a consideration of the visionary descent to the chariot. It describes theentrance test and the water test at the sixth palace (§§ 407–412) and thengives instructions for the descent (§§ 413–419). Revelations about variousimportant angels follow (§§ 420–421), leading to another set of instructionsfor the visionary journey to the chariot (§§ 422–424).

(Inthe translation I have for the most part followed Morray-Jones in delineatingthe major sections of theHekhalot Zutarti.)1ManuscriptsThe complete text of theHekhalot Zutartiis found in N, O, M40, M22, andD, all of which have been published in theSynopse. The text of N has beenheavily interpolated with other material. A fragment recovered from theCairo Geniza dated to the eleventh century (G7) preserves a substantialportion of §§ 335–356 and is our earliest textual source for the work.The text of the magical HandbookHavdala di-R. Akiva§ 3 overlaps withtheHekhalot Zutartiat §§ 362–365. Two Geniza fragments (G16 and G18)preserve material from this passage, but it uncertain to which of the largertexts they originally belonged. The incantation amulet G75 contains materialthat overlaps withHekhalot Zutarti§ 421 (cf. G8 2b 44b–49) and may beexcerpted from it. TheShi#ur Qomahmaterial in §§ 367b–369, 375 overlapswith theShi#ur Qomahpassage in M40 §§ 953–956 and with G9.All of this material has been used to reconstruct the eclectic criticaltext of theHekhalot Zutartiwhich is translated in this chapter. This workis preserved in fewer manuscripts than theHekhalot Rabbatiand theSarTorahand in a form less thoroughly edited.

He mentionsboth titles, but his allusions to their content con\brm only his knowledgeof theHekhalot Zutarti, speci\bcally § 424. He describes a praxis “to have avision of the chariot and to peer into the palaces of the angels on high” asfollows:1Surveys of the contents of theHekhalot Zutartiare given by Gruenwald inApocalypticand Merkavah Mysticism, 142–149; Schäfer,Übersetzung, 3:XVII–XXVII; idem, “Au\u0000\u0003au,” 51–54;idem,The Hidden and Manifest God, 55–75; idem,The Origins of Jewish Mysticism, 282–306;Morray-Jones, “Hekhalot Zutarti,” 269–272."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"hekhalot zutarti189He sits in fasting a certain number of days and rests his head between hisknees and whispers to the ground many songs and praises which are speci\bed.And so he peers into its (or “his”) inner rooms and chambers like one who seesseven palaces with his eyes, and he has a vision as if he were entering frompalace to palace and seeing what is in each.The parallels to § 424—which prescribes a forty-day fast, the same posture,and the whispering of an incantation to the ground—are clear. Moreover,the reference to “many songs and praises which are speci\bed” may alludeto the numerous adjurations also found in theHekhalot Zutarti, althoughthe text of ourHekhalot Rabbatialso contains many Merkavah hymns. Hai’squestioners also refer in some detail to the Story of the Four Who EnteredParadise, which is also found in theHekhalot Zutarti.2We see, therefore, that some version of the work translated in this chapterwent by the titleHekhalot Zutartias early as the eleventh century. But,surprisingly, none of the surviving manuscripts use this title. Indeed, theonly place it appears as a title to a Hekhalot text is in manuscript TalmudTora Livorno, where it is found before theHekhalot Rabbati.3Of the completemanuscripts, M22 ends theSar Torahmacroform (§ 306) with a colophonand then begins with an untitled § 335, while O M40 D placeThe Great Seal-Fearsome Crown(§§ 318–321, which self-delineates with titles in § 320 and§ 321) between theSar Torahand theHekhalot Zutartiand commence § 335,again, without a title. N placesThe Great Seal-Fearsome Crownin the sameposition, then gives the end-title “Hiklhot hekhalot rabbatiis \bnished” at theend of § 335, but this is obviously an inadvertent misplacement.As for the end of the work, M22 concludes § 426 with “It is ended,” thenadds § 427, a version of Psalm 126 with each verse attributed to a di\u0010ferentangel. This paragraph ends with “The book of the working of the chariot isconcluded.” The other four complete manuscripts continue after § 426 withan Aramaic magical handbook (§§ 489–495) which identi\bes itself as a bookin § 489. No other break or title is introduced between the two works. It ispossible, therefore, that M22 intended to apply the title “The book of theworking of the chariot” (sefer ma#aseh mer(!)kavah) to theHekhalot Zutarti,although this possibility is thrown into some doubt by the ending markerafter § 426.Accepting the precedent of Rav Hai, I retain the titleHekhalot Zutartihereas a convention.2For Hai’sresponsumsee the introduction to chapter two, n. 6.

One can debatewhere exactly both of these units should end, but there is widespread agree-ment that something like this redaction preserves the earliest recoverablecore of the book. This core has been heavily interpolated in N (see below),but even when we set aside those interpolations, the core-text shows signsof a careless and incomplete redaction.The area of greatest textual variety is found in the section that tells theStory of the Four Who Entered Paradise, which is closely associated witha description of an account of a (presumably the) ascent of R. Akiva. Forthe most part the manuscripts cover the same ground, but the order of thematerial is highly variable. In the chart below I lay out the placement of eachparagraph as it appears in each complete manuscript and in G7. The storyis also told with virtually the same wording inMerkavah Rabba§§ 671–674and I include the evidence of this formulation for comparison.

Some of these issues have been discussed brie\u0000\u0002y in chapter one and theycannot delay us here. Su\u0010\bce to say that something like either §§ 344–345–346–348 or §§ 344–346–348 could plausibly have represented the originaltext of the story in the earliest recoverable core of the book and that the otherreadings in the manuscripts can be explained by a process of accretion andmiscopying.Another possible indication of careless or incomplete editing is theappearance of the paragraph about the impressive powers of the practitionerstwice in slightly di\u0010ferent forms, once in § 349–350a and once in § 361. Inaddition, overlaps with the text of theHavdalah di-R. Akivain §§ 362–365;with theShi#ur Qomahin §§ 367–369, 375; and with G8 and an amulet fromthe Cairo Geniza in §§ 420–421 may point to the incorporation of traditionalmaterial in relatively undigested form.As noted above, there is some debate on where exactly the two majorunits in the core text should end. The passage §§ 368b–372, 375 is foundonly in N and Schäfer considers §§ 368b–374 to be either a compositionby the ̇Haside Ashkenazor an earlier text heavily revised by them.4Morray-Jones, however, considers §§ 368b–375 to be a coherent passage with whichhe \bnds parallels in the Coptic Gnostic workOn the Origins of the World.Indeed, he argues that the two texts both share two textual errors derivingfrom a HebrewVorlageand therefore that theHekhalot Zutartipassage musthave its origins in the fourth century or earlier.5The two positions are notin principle mutually exclusive: although it does not seem particularly likely,it is possible that the ̇Haside Ashkenazhad access to otherwise unknownvery early traditions which they inserted into theHekhalot Zutartiat thispoint.There are three opinions about where to \bnd the original ending of thesecond major unit, and therefore of the core work as a whole. Elior regards§§ 420–426 as later additions, which she relegates to an appendix, andtherefore would end the core work with § 419. Morray-Jones accepts theproblematic character of §§ 420–421 and § 425–426: they are attributedto R. Ishmael, but when a speaker is speci\bed elsewhere in theHekhalotZutarti, he is always R. Akiva. But Morray-Jones then notes that in ourearliest reference to theHekhalot ZutartiHai made it clear that he knew§ 424. Therefore Morray-Jones also omits §§ 420–421, 425–426, but includes4Schäfer,Übersetzung, 3:XIII, 66 n. 1; idem, “Au\u0000\u0003au,” 57; idem,The Hidden and ManifestGod, 64.

Akiva) as the end of the corework.6Schäfer, while aware of the complexities of the question, includes theentirety of §§ 420–426 as part of theHekhalot Zutartiin his treatment of itinThe Hidden and Manifest God.7Rather than attempting to adjudicate on either debate, I simply includeall of §§ 368b–375 and §§ 420–426 so readers may have all the relevant datawith which to form their own conclusions.As noted above, the text of §§ 375–406 is found only in N in theHekhalotZutarti, although various formulations of the material appear elsewhere inother manuscripts. I have translated § 375, because Morray-Jones regards itas original to the core text, but I have omitted the rest, apart fromThe Youthpassage, as noted below. Very brie\u0000\u0002y, the content of the omitted materialis as follows. Paragraphs 376–386 consist ofShi#ur Qomahspeculationparalleled in §§ 939–946, 957–959 and sometimes elsewhere. Paragraphs§ 376, 384–399 (with some paragraphs repeating) is a version ofThe Youthtext, which I translate in chapter seven from what I regard to be a bettermanuscript. In §§ 400–401 we \bnd names of the Youth and other angelicnames. Paragraphs 401–402 present revelations by R. Nehuniah ben HaQanahas related by R. Ishmael. And in §§ 405–406 R. Akiva relates revelations aboutMetatron and the heavenly morning worship.We see that N contains many longer readings in theHekhalot Zutarti,including substantial passages, and that many of these are clearly secondary.But nevertheless, in some cases the longer readings of N are more originalthan the shorter text of the other manuscripts, so each case must be judgedon its own merits. All of these longer readings are translated in the text orthe notes except for §§ 376–406.Date, Provenance, and Social ContextMost specialists have taken theHekhalot Zutartito be one of our earliestHekhalot texts. Gruenwald sees it as “in all likelihood the oldest Hekhalot textproper that we possess,” following a (regrettably still unpublished) linguisticanalysis of the text by Jonas Green\beld, on the basis of which the authorwas reportedly inclined toward a Palestinian provenance and a date in thesecond or third centuryce.8Morray-Jones has reconstructed an archetype6Elior,Hekhalot Zutarti, 36–37; Morray-Jones, “Hekhalot Zutarti,” 266–269.7Schäfer,The Hidden and Manifest God, 55 n. 2.

Scholem did not specify a date or provenance for the"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"hekhalot zutarti193of the Story of the Four Who Entered Paradise which he argues must bepre-Talmudic, dating to the third or fourth century, if not earlier. Indeed,he argues that ideas undergirding the Story of the Four are assumed by theApostle Paul’s description of his own visionary experiences in 2 Corinthians12 as well as his vision as described in Acts 22.9In addition I have argued thata hymn in the Qumran Hodayot (1QHacol. 16) was in\u0000\u0002uenced by the sametemplate of mystical ideas as are found in the Story of the Four.10Although Schäfer does not propose a speci\bc date of composition for theHekhalot Zutarti, he has argued that it is later than and dependent on theHekhalot Rabbati. In particular, he \bnds di\u0010ferent emphases in the two majorsections of the former: §§ 335–374 focuses on the theology of the divinename and limits its treatment of angels to the four living creatures, whereas§§ 407–426 has a strong interest of the theology of God as King, focusing onangels as guardians of the entrances to the seven palaces along with angelicprinces known from theHekhalot Rabbati. The second section is dependenton theHekhalot Rabbati, while moving the ascent tradition in a theurgicdirection.11Morray-Jones, however, argues the opposite: that theHekhalot Zutartiisearlier than theHekhalot Rabbati. He agrees with Schäfer on the importanceof divine names, but he \bnds this emphasis in both parts of theHekhalotZutarti. He considers the latter the earlier document because it includes whathe regards as the earliest version of the Story of the Four and the earliestaccount of the water test, both of which he believes were composed no laterthan the second or the third centuries. He also agrees that the ascent accountin theHekhalot Zutartiis related to that in theHekhalot Rabbati, but he \bndsthe former version to be much simpler than the latter and therefore probablyearlier.12The question of the relative dates of theHekhalot Zutartiand theHekhalotRabbatiis a complex one involving both theological and redactional issuesand the consideration of intricate stratigraphic relationships between thetwo texts. I take no position on the question here, although I do believeHekhalot Zutarti, but he thought the Palestinian layer of its Aramaic to be earlier than theBabylonian layer and he compared it to traditions in the Greek magical papyri and seemedto see it, along with the rest of the Hekhalot texts, as \btting roughly into the period of “earlyTalmudic tradition.” SeeJewish Gnosticism, 6, 76, and (quoted) 83.9Morray-Jones, “Paradise Revisited,” 207–208, 277–289.10Davila, “The Hodayot Hymnist.”11Schäfer,Übersetzung, 3:XVI–XVII; idem,The Hidden and Manifest God, 55 n. 2, 60, 65,73–75; idem,The Origins of Jewish Mysticism, 282–283, 298–303.12Morray-Jones, “Merkavah Mysticism,” 232–247."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"194chapter four: introductionthat theHekhalot Zutartipreserves some of the earliest traditions found inthe Hekhalot literature.Little can be said about the social context of the work apart from general-izations already made about the Hekhalot literature: the composers of thetraditions gathered in it knew the Bible and some rabbinic traditions andmay have had a scribal background. In addition they had a special interest inthe theurgic use of divine names to tap divine power.Theological ThemesTheHekhalot Zutartievinces a strong interest in the dangers associated withcontact with the divine realm. Many passages deal with the perils of theascent or descent to the chariot. The opening paragraph (§ 335) issues anobscure warning about this subject; it is the apparent moral of the Story of theFour Who Entered Paradise (§§ 338–345); dangers from angels of violence\bgure in an account of an ascent of R. Akiva (§ 346); and the entrance test(§ 407) and the water test (§§ 408–410) likewise portray dangers from hostileangels. The care that must be taken with magical use of the divine name isunderlined in § 337. One di\u0010\bcult passage contrasts biblical verses involvingvisions to explore the question whether and under what circumstancesmortals may see God and live (§§ 350b–352). This concern with divine dangeris driven by a fascination with the use of ritual to gain access to the divinerealm in order for the practitioner to make theurgic use of its vast power.(See below under “ritual practices.”)The heavenly throne room and its denizens are also objects of considerableinterest. There is a description of Ezekiel’s four living creatures in §§ 353–360and again in the so-called Throne Midrash (§§ 368–375). The latter is foundonly in N, but Morray-Jones has argued it to be both original and very ancient.The guardian angels of the entrances to the seven palaces are important inthe ascent instructions of §§ 413–417. The account of the triumph of thesuccessful descender to the chariot again tells of the realm of the chariot,including the ophannim, the cherubim, and the Hashmal (§ 411). Variousmighty angels, both obscure and well-known, appear in § 420. The angel#Anaphi\"el is the subject of § 421 and Suriah, Prince of the Presence, o\u0010fersa closing curse and blessing in §§ 425–426. The Shekhinah, God’s visiblepresence on earth, is mentioned in § 364.1313For a more detailed exposition of the theology of theHekhalot Zutarti, see Schäfer,TheHidden and Manifest God, 55–75."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"hekhalot zutarti195StoriesThe microforms in theHekhalot Zutartiare consistently presented as narra-tions by R. Akiva, with the sole exceptions of §§ 420–421, 425–426, whichare attributed to R. Ishmael and which may be secondary additions to thecore text. The stories in theHekhalot Zutartitend to be brief, and all of theminvolve the ascent of one or more human beings to heaven where, if theymake the trip successfully, they receive an esoteric revelation. We are toldthat Moses ascended to God to learn a Sar Torah adjuration (§ 336). The Storyof the Four Who Entered Paradise illustrates the dangers of the heavenlyjourney (§§ 338–345). Besides the latter narrative, we read of three additionalascents of R. Akiva: in the \brst he ascended to the throne of God, where the“great name” was revealed to him (§ 337); in another associated with theStory of the Four he was protected by God from angels of violence and hereceived an obscure revelation about a heavenly “vestibule” (§§ 346, 348);and in yet another he ascended to heaven in a wagon of \bre, gazed withclear sight on the entire universe, and received a revelation of divine names(§ 366). Finally, in § 410 Akiva tells us about an unnamed practitioner whocame to the sixth celestial palace, failed the water test, and was destroyed bythe angels therein.Ritual PracticesA major concern in theHekhalot Zutartiis the revelation of divine names tobe used in adjurations and magical rites. In the \brst part of the work, Mosesis taught to invoke names in order to remember learning (§ 336); a “greatname” is revealed to R. Akiva (but not the reader!) to bring prosperity to thecareful user (§ 337); more names are revealed in § 351; an adjuration repletewith divine names andnomina barbaraappears in §§ 357–359, concludingwith telegraphic instructions that involve fasting and perhaps reciting a listof seventy names on a heavenly journey “to go forth and to come in”; anotherinvocation of divine names is found in §§ 362–364, which according to § 365establishes Torah in the hand of the practitioner and protects him fromharm in the night gloom; in § 367 names revealed to R. Akiva are describedas a cosmic seal that controls the forces of nature. A paragraph describingthe theurgic powers of the practitioner appears twice (§ 349–350a/§ 361)in slightly di\u0010ferent forms. He is able to travel unharmed throughout theheavenly and earthly realms, evidently using rites such as those described inthis section, which involve reciting God’s praise and various divine names,while manipulating the letters of the names recited (cf. the references toletters of names in §§ 356, 362, 364, 374, 421, and 424)."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"196chapter four: introductionThe second section of the work also focuses on the use of divine names,primarily the names of the angels. The guardian angel of each of the entrancesto the seven palaces must be invoked by name and then paci\bed by therecitation of additional names called “seals” and “seal-rings” in order thathe may be passed safely (§§ 413–417), after which the practitioner is passedfrom lap to lap of ever mightier angels until he is invited to make a request(§ 418), apparently for anything he wants. Another adjuration invokes thesesame mighty angels using a passage from the Song of Songs, again sothat they may be compelled to do whatever the practitioner demands(§ 419). An incantation prayer involving the manipulation of letters to invokethe obedience and protection of the mighty angel#Anaphi\"el is given in§ 421.Finally, a rite for “the praxis of the ascent and the descent of the chariot”is prescribed in § 422–424 which involves a forty-day fast, sexual continence,the adopting of a speci\bc posture, the whispering of an incantation, andthe repeated performance of the rite in coordination with holy days in theliturgical calendar.Thus the entire core of theHekhalot Zutartihas a strong interest in thetheurgic use of divine and angelic names, with the \brst part concentratingmore on the names themselves and the second on their use in an ascentrite. But despite this di\u0010ference in emphasis, the entire work has a practicalemphasis: most of the time the \bnal objective of the adjurations and ritualsis to compel divine powers to do the will of the practitioner.Paragraph, Chapter, Verse, and Line DivisionsThe complete manuscripts of theHekhalot Zutartiinclude no markers ofchapter or verse divisions, although verse numbers (the chapter numbers arelost) are found in the Geniza fragment G7 and are noted in the translationof the latter in chapter eight. The translation of the complete core text inthis chapter is divided into paragraphs according to the enumeration in theSynopse.

G7 also contains an additionalline, the letters of which are badly damaged. See the tentative translation in chapter eight.§ 336aParagraph 336 is missing in G7. This may mean that it is secondary, although notethat § 337 has the same beginning in G7 (“In the hour that”), so it is possible that § 336was lost by haplography in this textual tradition. A variant version of § 336 appears justafter this in N only and reads as follows: “(§ 340)When Moses ascended to God, the Holy One,blessed be He, taught him about every man〈whose heart〉errs concerning Him: Invoke overhim these names:\"YWM (or “Awful”) YHWH of Hosts\"H BHH YH BYH YHW\"L YHW\"L.

Many of the prayers seem tohave been incorporated and adapted from elsewhere. Michael Swartz hasdone the most thorough redactional and historical-critical analysis of thework and I will summarize and interact with his conclusions here, takinginto account any responses by others.ContentsI follow Swartz in dividing theMa#aseh Merkavahinto four major sections,with another unit added in only one manuscript between the second andthird sections.1Section I (§§ 544–559) presents conversations between the three rabbiswho are the central human characters in the Hekhalot literature: R. Ishmael,R. Akiva, and R. Nehuniah ben HaQanah. The main topic is ascents toheaven and the subject matter consists of revelations about the celestialcosmography and prayers to be recited in order to experience a vision ofheaven.Section II (§§ 560–570) recounts that R. Nehuniah ben HaQanah taughtR. Ishmael a Sar Torah praxis involving theurgic prayers, seals, and names,which R. Ishmael tried out successfully, but not without setback.At this point manuscript N alone adds a Sar Torah praxis narrated inBabylonian Aramaic by R. Ishmael in conversation with R. Akiva (§§ 571–578).Section III (§§ 579–591) is narrated by R. Ishmael, sometimes in conversa-tion with others, and it reveals angelic names and \bve prayers.1Swartz,Mystical Prayer, 65–66."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"246chapter five: introductionIn section IV (§§ 592–596) R. Ishmael inquires about prayers to pray inorder to induce visionary experiences and R. Akiva narrates two of his ownvisions and the prayers he used during them.2ManuscriptsTheMa#aseh Merkavahsurvives complete in the \bve manuscripts N, O, M40,M22, and D, although these represent multiple recensions (see below).Five other manuscripts contain material that overlaps with theMa#asehMerkavah: Jerusalem 381, a Sephardic (Balkan) manuscript of the sixteenthor seventeenth century; New York JTS 1746, an Oriental manuscript of theseventeenth century; New York Enelow 704 ( JTS 1786), an Ashkenazic,manuscript of the sixteenth century; Oxford Michael 175 (Neubauer 2257)an Ashkenazic manuscript of the early eighteenth century; Oxford Opp. 495(Neubauer 1568), another Ashkenazic manuscript of the early eighteenthcentury.3Swartz has broken the \brst four of these manuscripts down into twogroups.4Jerusalem 381 and New York 1746 contain a similar passage (corre-sponding, respectively, to §§ 545–546, 553–556, 558–559, 552 and §§ 545–547, 554–559, 552) and Swartz has argued on text-critical grounds that bothare excerpted from the text of theMa#aseh Merkavahfound in M22 or itsVorlage. New York 1786 and Oxford 2257 include a smorgasbord of Hekhalotpassages known from the major macroforms, includingMa#aseh Merkavah§ 546,3 Enoch22B (containing material related to § 558)Ma#aseh Merkavah§§ 579–582; material from theHekhalot Zutartiand theHekhalot Rabbati,andMa#aseh Merkavah§§ 554–555. Swartz judges that the text parallel topassages in theMa#aseh Merkavahis not derived directly from the latter, butrather comes from a source shared with it.The translation of theMa#aseh Merkavahin this chapter is of an eclecticcritical text produced from the \bve complete manuscripts as transcribed intheSynopse. I have not consulted any of the other manuscripts, but in a fewplaces I note readings from one of them as reported by Swartz and Schäfer.2The contents of theMa#aseh Merkavahare also summarized by Gruenwald inApocalypticand Merkavah Mysticism, 181–187 and Schäfer inThe Hidden and Manifest God, 77–95.3Swartz,Mystical Prayer, 41–52.

He argues that the original work consisted of section I(§§ 544–559) and perhaps section IV (§§ 592–596). The prayers in section Iwere taken from other contexts rather than being composed for the purposeof the ascent, although the prayers in section IV \bt their current contextwell and were probably composed for it. Next, the Sar Torah instructionsof section II (§§ 560–570) were inserted into the original work. The prayersin this section appear also to have been composed for the same purpose asthe narrative frame. At some point §§ 552–553 was added to this form ofthe work, producing the shorter recension as we have it now. This shorterrecension is found in M22 and is excerpted in Jerusalem 381 and New York1746.The longer recension was created when section III (§§ 579–591) wasinserted into the penultimate form (lacking §§ 552–553) of the shorterrecension. Swartz argues that the prayers in section III have been addedfrom elsewhere and theurgic material has been interpolated into them inorder to make them \bt their current contexts. The longer recension is foundin O, M40, and D. Manuscript D has lost part of § 590 through part of § 592,but this is due to the loss of a folio that originally contained the missingpassage.Finally, manuscript N alone contains the third recension, which adds theAramaic Sar Torah praxis of §§ 571–578 to the longer recension.65Scholem,Jewish Gnosticism, 101–102.6Swartz’s conclusions, based on the detailed exegesis of the document in chapters \bve tonine and eleven to fourteen, are summarized inMystical Prayer, 103–104 and 166–168. Whileaccepting Swartz’s analysis in general, Schäfer questions some of its speci\bcs (Übersetzung,"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"248chapter five: introductionDate, Provenance, and Social ContextSwartz concludes that the prayers in sections I, II, and IV were composedwith awareness of the poetic conventions of the third to \bfth centuries,but were written somewhat later, from the fourth to the seventh centuriesin Palestine. The narrative frames around the prayers often involve mat-ters not actually found in the prayers themselves, particularly heavenlyascents, which shows that many of the poems were composed before thecompilation of theMa#aseh Merkavah, and for di\u0010ferent purposes. Indeed,some are known from other contexts from the rabbinic era. The framescome from the latter end of this period and Swartz suggests, on the basis ofconclusions drawn by Halperin, that the ascent motif has a Babylonian ori-gin.7Editing of the work apparently continued in the post-Talmudic period,although Swartz also notes that the short recension is found only in an Ital-ian manuscript (M22) and suggests that it may follow that the archetypebehind the two recensions may have existed before it reached the hands ofpietistic circles in Europe.8Schäfer, however, responding to this argumentin Swartz’s doctoral dissertation on which Swartz’s monograph is based,notes that the manuscripts are late and he doubts that they help us dis-cern the provenance of the text itself. As with the rest of the Hekhalotliterature, Schäfer sees the redactional process that produced theMa#asehMerkavahranging from Amoraic Palestine to Geonic Babylonia to medievalGermany.9Theological ThemesA preoccupation with the name of God pervades theMa#aseh Merkavahand is present at all redactional levels. A number of speci\bc divine namesappear, such as RWZYY YHWH (§ 544, etc.), GHWRY\"L YHWH (§ 555),\"NPR\"YHWH (§ 559), Y ̇HDY YHWH (§ 587), ̇T ̇TRWSY YHWH (§ 590), etc. Moreoften, the divine name is praised in general terms. It is a frequent theme inthe many prayers in the work (e.g., in §§ 548, 551, 587–591, 592–594), butalso in the two Sar Torah passages (e.g., in §§ 562, 567–568 and §§ 574, 577).The forty-two-letter name of God appears (§§ 565, § 571) in both of the latterpassages.3:XXX–XXXII, esp. n. 99) as well as some of Swartz’s broader conclusions (ibid., XXXIII–IV).On the latter see the next section.7Swartz,Mystical Prayer, 216–220, citing (p. 220 n. 27) Halperin,The Merkabah in RabbinicLiteratureas background.8Swartz,Mystical Prayer, 220.9Schäfer,Übersetzung, 3:XXXIII–XXXIV."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"ma#aseh merkavah249The cosmography of the celestial realm is also of special interest, particu-larly in section I, where we \bnd a detailed account of the bridges over therivers of \bre, the rivers of hail, the storehouses of snow, wheels of \bre, andother types of rivers (§§ 546, 558–559). God’s chariot is mentioned often(e.g., §§ 548, 553, 557, 567, 579, 590), but in addition the seven heavenlypalaces are replete with myriads of chariots that participate in the heavenlyliturgy (§§ 554–555).Numerous angels play roles in the work, again at all redactional levels.There are attending angels (e.g., § 546); “the angels who stand behind the holyliving creatures” (§ 569); cherubim, ophannim, and seraphim (e.g., § 559,590); and the guardian angels of the entrances to the seven palaces (§§ 581–582). In the \brst Sar Torah passage we \bnd Suriah, Prince of the Presence(§ 560), the Prince of Torah, YWPY\"L (§ 560, cf. § 564), and two Angels of thePresence,ˇSQDHWZYY/ˇSQD ̇HWZYH (§ 561, cf. § 584) and PDQDS (with manyvariants) (§§ 563, 565, 566). The second Sar Torah passage refers to Metatronand perhaps Sandalphon (§ 574, cf. § 582), Michael the great prince (§ 575),the great Prince of Torah (§ 578), and other angels. The Prince of the Presenceappears again, under the name YSWDY\"L, in § 581; one of the “angels of glory”in § 582 is named as “PSYBGD GHWR\"L GHWRYY ZRZ(Y)\"L the Angel ofthe Presence,” and a fourth Angel of the Presence, ZBWDY\"L, is named in§ 583, withˇSQD ̇HWZYH appearing again in § 584. Gabriel is mentioned twiceand Qa ̇spi\"el once in § 581 and Z#WPY\"L, Prince of Gehinnom in § 587. TheShekhinah, God’s visible presence on earth, is mentioned a number of times(§§ 551, 553, 555, 570, 591, 592).StoriesThe paragraphs in theMa#aseh Merkavahwhich have headers giving anarrator always name either R. Ishmael or R. Akiva. Some units are narratedby R. Ishmael alone (e.g., § 552); fewer by R. Akiva alone (e.g., § 545); someby R. Ishmael in conversation with R. Akiva (e.g., § 544), some by R. Ishmaelintroducing a tradition narrated by R. Nehuniah ben HaQanah (e.g., § 556);and some by R. Ishmael in conversation with R. Nehuniah ben HaQanah(e.g., §§ 560–570).Most narrative passages in the work are brief accounts of visionaryexperiences of one of these three characters, which accounts, however,involve no particular dramatic development. These include R. Akiva’s visionof angels in § 550; visions of R. Nehuniah ben HaQanah narrated in § 556 and§ 579; an ascent of R. Ishmael in § 558; and a conversation between R. Ishmaeland two additional Angels of the Presence concerning his and R. Akiva’s"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"250chapter five: introductionmerit (§§ 583–584). In addition R. Ishmael reports two conversations withR. Nehuniah ben HaQanah, one in which the latter reveals the names ofall the angelic princes of wisdom (§ 580) and one in which the two rabbisdiscuss R. Ishmael’s recitation of angelic names in § 581–582 and the \bveprayers of protection that should be used when invoking these angels (§ 586).The only real story in the work is the account of R. Nehuniah ben HaQanahteaching R. Ishmael a Sar Torah praxis and the attempt of R. Ishmael thento carry the praxis out. When he realized that he could not complete therequisite forty-day fast, he attempted to abort the procedure by recitingthe forty-two letter name, but an angry Angel of the Presence descendedand compelled him to \bnish the fast. In the end he did so and apparentlycompleted the praxis successfully (§ 561–565).Ritual Practices10Swartz characterizes theMa#aseh Merkavahas “[a] collection of potentprayers,” but one that did not have “an integrated praxis” for their use.11This isan accurate assessment: the document consists largely of a jumble of prayerspresented, sometimes with other ritual practices, to be used for visionaryor theurgic purposes. That said, the two Sar Torah rites focus more on ritualactions than on prayers.In the \brst section the opening prayer is to be recited simply to praise God(§ 544), although it also refers to mysteries to be used for “accomplishingTorah.” Other prayers are to be used to bring about a vision of the celestialbridges (§§ 547–548), and a vision of angels (§§ 550–551). There is alsoreference to a song that induces a vision of the chariot and grants theurgicpowers, although the song itself seems not to be given (§ 557). As notedabove, Swartz has argued convincingly that the prayers in section I werecomposed for other purposes and incorporated secondarily into this work.Indeed, the song in § 551 is a variant version of#Alay le-shabbea ̇h, knownfrom the Jewish liturgy.In M22 alone we \bnd a prayer attributed to R. Ishmael which is apparentlymeant to be used as a theurgic invocation (§§ 552–553).Section II describes a Sar Torah praxis that involves a forty-day limited fast,ritual immersion, sensory deprivation, the practitioner standing in a magiccircle and sealing his own body parts with “seals” (nomina barbara), and10The performative and ideological aspects of the ritual language and name language intheMa#aseh Merkavahare explored by Janowitz inThe Poetics of Ascent.11Swartz,Mystical Prayer, 27 (cf. 221–222)."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"ma#aseh merkavah251the recitation of invocations and prayers (§§ 560–568). The forty-two letterdivine name is used in this episode in an unsuccessful attempt to interruptthis praxis. This section also gives instructions for invoking some namedangels who stand behind the celestial living creatures, along with a prayerfor protection from said angels (§ 569) and describes an obscure rite for avision of the Shekhinah involving the invocation of twelve words and thepraying of a prayer (§ 570). Swartz takes the prayers in section II to have beencomposed for their current contexts.In N alone we \bnd a second Sar Torah praxis (§§ 571–578) which is set ina speci\bc period in the Jewish liturgical year and which involves the use ofthe forty-two-letter divine name, fasting, invocations, dietary restrictions,immersion, and rites involving the writing of divine names on objects, someof which are consumed and others of which are rinsed with wine and thewine consumed.The third section includes a recitation of the names of the guardianangels of the seven palaces (§§ 581–582) and \bve prayers to be prayed forforti\bcation when invoking these angels (§§ 586–591). In section IV, R. Akivareveals a prayer for the vision of the Shekhinah and the goings-on beforethe throne of glory in §§ 592–594 and a prayer for “a vision of above theseraphim” in §§ 595–596. Again, Swartz takes the prayers in section III to besecondarily inserted into their present context and to have been interpolatedwith theurgic material, but the prayer in section IV to be composed for itspresent context.12Paragraph DivisionsTheeditio princepsof the complete text of theMa#aseh Merkavahwaspublished by Scholem.

Its text is less well preserved than that of the other majormacroforms and its contents are highly esoteric. It has received comparativelylittle attention in the secondary literature and many basic questions aboutits content, purpose, date, and provenance remain unresolved.ContentsTheMerkavah Rabbaopens with a theurgic rite involving the angel San-dalphon (§§ 655–658). Another collection of theurgic rituals follows, whoseaim is generically to have one’s prayers heard (§ 659–670, of which §§ 664–670 are mostly in Aramaic). These passages are narrated by R. Ishmael. Thencomes a version of the Story of the Four Who Entered Paradise (§§ 671–674).Then a series of praxes for remembering Torah are revealed by R. Nehuniahben HaQanah, R. Ishmael, and R. Akiva (§§ 675–687). After this, the Prince ofTorah reveals a set of adjurations preliminary to the revelation of theShi#urQomah(§§ 688–694). Then theShi#ur Qomahitself is revealed (§§ 695–704).R. Ishmael then extols the bene\bts of the study of the just-revealedShi#urQomahmystery (§§ 705–706a). The work concludes with an adjuration ofMetatron (§ 706b) and two incantation prayers to God (§ 707–708).11Surveys of the contents of theMerkavah Rabbaare given by Gruenwald inApocalypticand Merkavah Mysticism, 177–180, 213–215; Schäfer, “Prolegomena,” 24–29; idem,Übersetzung,4:XXIII–XXX; idem,The Hidden and Manifest God, 97–121."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"302chapter six: introductionManuscriptsThis work is preserved in N, O, M40, M22, and D. Manuscript D, however,is damaged and everything that it contained after § 657 is lost. In addition,M22 has a short recension that concluded with § 670. Schäfer also reportsthat substantial passages from theMerkavah Rabbaappear in the esotericworkSode Razayyaby Eleazar of Worms.2This translation is based on an eclectic critical text produced from the\bve complete manuscripts of the work as transcribed in theSynopse. A fewadditional textual sources were used as well. For the Story of the Four WhoEntered Paradise (§§ 651–654), see below under “redactional issues.” For theparallels to §§ 677–679 collated in the notes, see below and § 677 n. a. TheShi#ur Qomahtext in §§ 695–704 has parallels to some otherShi#ur Qomahpassages published in theSynopseas well as the Geniza fragment G9. Theseparallels have not been fully collated, but variants of interest are cited in thenotes.As far as I am aware, this is the \brst English translation of the completetext of theMerkavah Rabba.TitleUnusually for the Hekhalot literature, this work does consistently come witha title. The titleMerkavah Rabbais given by all three manuscripts of thelong recension (N M40; O in a gloss) as a postscript to the work. Theeditioprincepsby Musajo\u0010f gave the work this title, but also the title “The Mysteryof Sandalphon” on the basis of § 656 (cf. § 597). The latter title is in larger,bold print.3I retain the title used in the manuscripts, which has also become theconvention.Redactional IssuesAs noted above, theMerkavah Rabbasurvives in a long recension (§ 655–708in N, O, M40) and a short recension (§§ 655–670 in M22), while the text of Dis truncated at the end of § 657 and we do not know how much more materialit contained. The four complete manuscripts all have a closing marker, thoseof the long recension “Merkavah Rabbais \bnished” and that of the shortrecension the phrase “It is \bnished. It is \bnished” (slyq slyq).

It drawsfreely on pre-existent literary traditions, sometimes incorporating themrelatively undigested. The Hebrew calendrical theurgic praxis in §§ 659–670 is very similar to the praxis found in theMa#aseh Merkavahonly in N in§§ 571–578. That said, the latter text is a Sar Torah praxis whereas the versionin theMerkavah Rabbais for more general theurgic use. Manuscript M22bears witness to a recension ofMerkavah Rabbawhich ended with this unit.We do not know whether this is an early form of the text to which §§ 671–708were subsequently added or a secondary excerpt of a more-original longrecension.The Story of the Four Who Entered Paradise in §§ 671–674 is essentiallythe same recension as that found inHekhalot Zutarti§§ 338–339/344–345,346, 348, so, on the principle of attempting to recover the earliest versions ofmicroforms when possible, I have translated an eclectic critical text of thepassage at §§ 338–348, using the evidence of both theHekhalot ZutartiandtheMerkavah Rabba. Those interested speci\bcally in the text of one work orthe other will \bnd the relevant readings in the notes to the translation.As already noted, §§ 677–678/79 is found in much the same form in twoother contexts: added to theHekhalot Rabbati(M22 §§ 278–279 and B §§ 278–280) and as part ofThe Chapter of R. Nehuniah Ben HaQanah(V §§ 308–309).Other parallels to the latter work are found in § 680 and § 705. The lists ofthe names of Metatron in § 682 also has parallels in other Hekhalot texts, asdo the \bnger-counting praxis in § 681, the hymn in § 687, and the adjurationof the Youth in § 690.Much of theShi#ur Qomahmaterial in §§ 695–704 is also known fromelsewhere and it appears in theMerkavah Rabbamanuscripts with a high4TheSar Panimappears in the other four manuscripts as the penultimate text precedingtheMerkavah Rabba.

See his “Prolegomena,”18–24 andÜbersetzung, 4:XVII–XXI.

N in particular tends to have a longer text, but one thatat times makes better sense than the shorter texts of the other manuscripts.It seems likely also that whatever version of theShi#ur Qomahwas originallyincorporated into theMerkavah Rabba(assuming the editing process wasas linear as that), the manuscripts have been in\u0000\u0002uenced by variant textualtraditions, of which there was no lack for theShi#ur Qomah.The high degree of textual \u0000\u0002uidity in the surviving manuscripts of theMerkavah Rabba, its free use of earlier material, the limited number ofmanuscripts preserving it, and its frequently perplexing content make itthe most di\u0010\bcult macroform for which to establish anUrtext. We can bereasonably con\bdent of the \u0000\u0002ow of thought for the narrative passages, butthe esoteric details of the adjurations and names are often uncertain, andeven the \u0000\u0002ow of though for theShi#ur Qomahmaterial is sometimes beyondrecovery with our surviving evidence.Date, Provenance, and Social ContextTheMerkavah Rabbais a late macroform, probably the latest of thosetranslated in this volume. It makes extensive use of earlier material, butit is very di\u0010\bcult to establish when it was edited into something like thelong recension we have now, except to say that it must have been beforethe copying of O around 1300. No Geniza fragments of it survive, apart fromoverlaps with itsShi#ur Qomahmaterial and in one or two places where it alsooverlaps with other macroforms. It has a lower density of Greek loanwordsthan is found in earlier macroforms but, contra Schäfer, they are not entirelyabsent.6The work has its own Torah-memory and adjurational material not knownfrom elsewhere, but assigning these passages a date would depend on howone understands the development of the Sar Torah traditions in relation toascent traditions, an area that is still imperfectly understood.On the one hand, theMerkavah Rabbais theologically closest to theMa#aseh Merkavah: they share an interest in theurgic name adjurationsto gain power, especially over knowledge of Torah, as well as in divinenames and angels unknown in other Hekhalot texts (e.g., RWZYY YHWHand Sandalphon). But on the other hand, the prayers that are so central totheMa#aseh Merkavahare conspicuously absent from theMerkavah Rabba,and these prayer traditions appear to be the earliest stratum of the former6Schäfer,Übersetzung, 4:XXI–XXII.

If a stratigraphic relationship can be deduced, theMerkavah Rabbaisclearly the later of the two.In addition theMerkavah Rabbadisplays a strong interest in divinenames and in rituals and adjurations clearly meant for use. This interestcontrasts sharply with both the ascent apocalypse3 Enochas found in thecomplete medieval manuscripts, which shows no such interest,7and withthe entirely descriptive account of the celestial realm found in theMassekhetHekhalot. Since3 Enochand theMassekhet Hekhalotare widely accepted tobe among the latest Hekhalot compositions, this di\u0010ference in focus mayindicate that theMerkavah Rabbawas written earlier than they. But weshould resist such simplistic attempts at diachronic pigeonholing withoutmuch more detailed arguments for a stratigraphic relationship between suchtexts.In short, it remains possible that some version of theMerkavah Rabbaexisted as early as the late Geonic period, but probably not much beforethis, and we know that the long recension was composed not later thanabout 1300. It is di\u0010\bcult to re\bne the range of possible dates of compositionfurther with our current state of knowledge. We can only hope that moremanuscripts of it will be recovered. Meanwhile, a more meticulous studyof its redaction of shared traditions may clarify its relationship to the otherHekhalot texts and give us a better understanding of its composition andediting.Theological ThemesAs already noted, theMerkavah Rabbais especially interested in theurgicadjurations, Sar Torah praxes, and the study of theShi#ur Qomah, andmeditation on divine names is central to all these interests. Attention toascent traditions is much less prominent, although it does recount the Story ofthe Four Who Entered Paradise, a descent to the chariot by R. Akiva (§§ 685–686), and perhaps a few otherworldly experiences of R. Ishmael (§§ 655, 680,688). There is an undercurrent of realized eschatology in the Hekhalot textsin that their visionary experiences imply a taste of the world to come, butthis implicit eschatological connection is made explicit in § 675 (cf. §§ 656and 680?).7The much earlier Geniza fragment of3 Enoch(G12) is another matter. It does giveattention to divine names and to astrological and physiognomic concerns. See the discussionand translation of G12 in chapter eight."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"306chapter six: introductionA variety of angels \bgure in the di\u0010ferent sections of the work, and theyare usually associated with adjurations and revelations. Sandalphon is tiedto an obscure praxis named after him in §§ 655–658. The calendrical praxisin §§ 659–670 invokes Michael, Gabriel, Suriel,\"KTRY\"L, Raphael, BWDY\"L,and YWM\"L, assigning each to one of the seven \brmaments. An Angel of thePresence is invoked in § 676 along with other named angels. Danger fromattacking angels is \u0000\u0002agged with reference to the praxis in § 681. Metatron isinvoked in the praxis in § 682 and in the adjuration in § 706, and he revealsthe \bnalShi#ur Qomahparagraph in § 704. Oddly, the Prince of Torah appearsonly as the revealer of the adjurations and divine names in §§ 688–694preliminary to the revelation of theShi#ur Qomah, as well as of the bulk oftheShi#ur Qomahpassage itself in §§ 695–703. The angelic Youth recites anadjuration ofnomina barbarain § 690. The Prince of the Presence is seatedon God’s left side according to § 691. As Schäfer notes, the angelic guardiansof the seven palaces, generally associated with the descent to the chariot,are conspicuous by their absence.8The Shekhinah, God’s visible presence onearth, is mentioned in § 675.StoriesThe three rabbis central to most of the Hekhalot traditions are the mainhuman players in theMerkavah Rabbaas well. Most units are narrated byR. Ishmael (e.g., §§ 682–684), sometimes quoting revelations by R. Nehuniahben HaQanah (e.g., § 677) or R. Akiva (§ 681). R. Akiva is the narrator of § 686,but this passage lies within the frame of § 685, which is also introduced byR. Ishmael. In a paragraph found only in N (§ 700), R. Nathan the disciple ofR. Ishmael is the narrator. He appears nowhere else in the Hekhalot corpus.The Story of the Four Who Entered Paradise is found in §§ 671–674 inessentially the same form as the version in theHekhalot Zutarti. R. Ishmaeltells of his travails in attempting to learn Torah and how R. Nehuniah benHaQanah taught him a praxis that solved his problems in §§ 677–680. Hegives its chain of tradition in §§ 675–676, and additional revelations come inan interchange between all three rabbis in § 681. In §§ 685–686 R. Akiva tellsof his visionary descent in which God revealed to him a surprising love forproselytes and ordered him to bear witness to a certain ritual praxis. Finally,in § 688, R. Ishmael brie\u0000\u0002y recounts a heavenly conversation in which hecalled on the Prince of Torah to reveal theShi#ur Qomahtraditions in thelatter part of the work.8Schäfer,The Hidden and Manifest God, 106."},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"merkavah rabba307Ritual PracticesAdjurations and prayers are scattered throughout theMerkavah Rabba. It islikely that prayers such as those in § 687and §§ 689–694 were meant to berecited, but a clear ritual context is not given for them.Other passages give more explicit indications of use and sometimespurpose. The “mystery of Sandalphon” in §§ 655–658 includes some obscureand probably corrupt instructions on how the praxis, which involves theinvocation of divine names, is to be carried out. Its purpose is not indicated.The calendrical theurgic praxis in §§ 659–670 is correlated with certainsacred festivals and involves the writing of divine names on various objects,with the names then being consumed by the practitioner, with or withoutthe object. The praxis includes self-puri\bcation, immersion, dietary restric-tions, and self-fumigation, and it somehow involves seven high angels whopraise God in the seven \brmaments. The objective is to make one’s prayerse\u0010\bcacious at any time or place. This purpose is rather di\u0010ferent from the verysimilar praxis found in one manuscript of theMa#aseh Merkavah(§§ 571–578), where it is used to invoke the powers of the Prince of Torah.Something very like a Sar Torah praxis does appear inMerkavah Rabba§§ 677–678, although the Prince of Torah is not mentioned in it. When at theage of thirteen R. Ishmael realized he could not remember his Torah lessonsproperly, he began to deny himself food, drink, washing and anointing, “theuse of the bed,” and various entertainments. It is unclear whether these actsof self-denial were meant as supplication for a solution to his problem or aspart of the rite itself. In any case, R. Nehuniah ben HaQanah took him to achamber in the Temple and taught him an adjuration of the great seal thatgave him perfect memory of Torah from that point on. Further re\bnements ofthe praxis seem to be revealed in § 681 and involve the enunciation of namesthat are counted by the practitioner on his \bngers. R. Ishmael then relatesanother praxis, which involves recitation of theShema#before bed (whichis standard Jewish praxis anyway), a morning prayer, and an adjuration ofMetatron using a list of the angel’s other names. The purpose of the rite isnot very clear, but seems to involve someone issuing decrees. The same rabbidescribes yet another praxis in § 684, this one requiring a forty-day “fast,”that is a program of dietary restrictions, during which he must refrain fromhaving a sexual emission. If we accept the apparent link to R. Akiva’s visionimplied in § 685, this praxis is connected in § 686 to the study of Torah.TheShi#ur Qomahrevelations in §§ 695–704 are presented without anyinternal indications of their purpose or use, although the aside in § 699that states “any who does not say the measure (or “praxis”) by this verse,"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"308chapter six: introductionhe is nothing but astray,” seems to imply that the traditions were recited.This coheres with the immediately following passage § 705–706a, in whichR. Ishmael asserts that “he who studies (or “repeats”) this great mystery” willgain many speci\bc this-worldly bene\bts, including perfect memory of Torah,as well as unspeci\bed bene\bts in the world to come.TheMerkavah Rabbaconcludes with an adjuration of Metatron (§ 706b)and two incantation prayers addressed to God (§§ 707–708). The adjurationand the \brst prayer seek the same sorts of bene\bts as those sought in §§ 705–706a. The second prayer requests only that God hear the prayer of the reciter.Paragraph DivisionsThe manuscripts do not divide the text into chapters or verses.

These passages have interesting connections to some of the materialin the larger macroforms and are worthy of further attention in connectionwith the Hekhalot literature.The Chapter of R. Nehuniah ben HaQanahThis passage, narrated by R. Ishmael, tells of a series of ritual practices taughtto him by R. Nehuniah ben HaQanah. The title is found in the manuscript atthe beginning of the passage. The conclusion is marked with “It is \bnished.”at § 314 and chapter two is marked in § 310, with verse two of that chapterindicated in § 311.After an opening invocation (§ 307), R. Ishmael recounts a praxis to perfectone’s memory of Torah which involves an adjuration, perhaps preceded byfasting and self-denial (§§ 308–309), then an adjuration of Metatron invokinghis di\u0010ferent names and using a \bnger-counting praxis known from elsewhere(§ 310), the bene\bts of which are extolled in §§ 311.

The great seal and thefearsome crown are two sets ofnomina barbara, each of which is assigneda prayer to go with it. The great seal “is the seal by which heaven and earthwere sealed” (§ 318/651; cf.Hekhalot Zutarti§ 367a) and the fearsome crown“is the crown by which they adjure all the princes of wisdom” (§ 318/651). Theprayer associated with the great seal (§ 320/653) deals with cosmologicalmatters and may have been composed for the stated purpose. The prayerassociated with the fearsome crown (§ 321/654) is a hymn of generic praiseto God and its content has no obvious connection with its stated purpose.The passage is found in more than one position in the manuscripts: itappears once in §§ 318–321 (N, O, M40, and D)1after theHekhalot Rabbatiandis sometimes treated as part of it, and in §§ 651–654 (O, M40, D), precedingtheMerkavah Rabba. I have translated an eclectic critical text reconstructedfrom these passages in these manuscripts.This passage is of interest because some of the other Hekhalot macroformsrefer from time to time to a great seal and a fearsome crown.The HekhalotRabbatiprescribes the use of both to pacify the guardians of the entrance ofthe seventh palace (§ 236); both are also prescribed for the praxis in theSarTorahdocument (§ 302; cf. the references to a seal and a crown in §§ 288,289, 298, and 304); theMa#aseh Merkavahcalls a list ofnomina barbarain§ 568 “a great seal” and the adjuration in § 569 “a great seal upon my limbs.”The Torah-memory praxis ofMerkavah Rabba§ 678 (//§ 279//§ 309) involvesadjuration by a great seal, and other adjurations by a great seal are found in§ 689 and § 708 (which also involves a crown). A great seal is also used in theascent praxis of G8 (2a 37).21The passage also appears in F twice: once after a fragment of theSar Torahand beforetheHekhalot Rabbatiand again after theHekhalot Rabbatiand the complete text of theSarTorah.

But given thevariations noted above, we have no reason to assume that the other mentionsof the great seal and the fearsome crown had in mind either the speci\bcnomina barbaraor the incantation prayers assigned to each in this text.

In N it is giventhe opening title “The mystery of Sandalphon, etc.” This phrase is used as thename of a theurgic praxis inMerkavah Rabba§ 656, but it is oddly irrelevanthere, since the angel Sandalphon (Merkavah Rabba§§ 655–658;Ma#asehMerkavah§§ 574[?] and 582) does not \bgure at all in the narrative. I haveassigned the passage a title that summarizes its content.The passage retells the story of the ascent of the notorious heretic Elishaben Avuyah into paradise, taking the event in an amusing direction. We aretold that when he arrived before a divine being, apparently God, who wassitting at the entrance to paradise, Elisha attempted to make the being explainan apparent inconsistency in scripture regarding whether there are one ormultiple \brmaments in heaven. This is an interesting variant version of thenames ornomina barbara(e.g.,Hekhalot Rabbati§§ 219–223, 229–232;Hekhalot Zutarti§ 358;Ma#aseh Merkavah§§ 560, 562). Although “crowns” are sometimes headgear worn by men(e.g.,Hekhalot Rabbatti§ 120;Sar Torah§ 288) or more often by God (e.g.,Hekhalot Rabbati§ 105;Hekhalot Zurtarti§ 372 N;Merkavah Rabba§ 697) or angels (e.g.,Hekhalot Rabbati§§ 156, 170–171), there are also references to “crowns” that have much the same function asseals (e.g.,Hekhalot Zutarti§ 349//361, § 360, 364, 374;Ma#aseh Merkavah§ 552, M22 only)."},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"344chapter seven: introductionStory of the Four Who Entered Paradise, which we have already seen in theHekhalot Zutarti(§§ 338–339/344–345) and theMerkavah Rabba(§§ 671–674). It is the only other passage in the Hekhalot literature to use the termpardes, and here too it means the celestial paradise rather than having somemore generic sense of “garden.” We have no way to determine the date orprovenance of the passage.TranslationsDavila.

F 22–33. This translation is of a critical eclectic text recon-structed from the four complete manuscripts as transcribed in theSynopseand the text of G1. I have also translated the Geniza fragment in chaptereight.The text opens (§ 623) with R. Akiva asking R. Eliezer the Great howone goes about adjuring the Prince of the Presence. R. Eliezer warns ofthe world-threatening danger of invoking this angel and receives assur-ances of R. Akiva’s serious intent, then reveals the praxis in the rest ofthe work. It consists of a ritual praxis involving fasting, sexual continence,immersion, and self-isolation. The practitioner must recite an adjurationto angels of fear (§ 624) and must invoke the forty-two-letter divine nameover himself (§ 625), then he invokes the Prince of the Presence him-self by the name of Ozhayah (§ 626–627). This angel is then invoked byhis fourteen names (§§ 628–634), his \bve chosen names (§§ 635–636),his “greatest name” (§ 637) and by the right hand of God (§ 638), andthen he is dismissed (§ 639).

This brief work describes an angelic \bgure whose titleis the Youth (ha-na#ar). The Youth acts as a heavenly high priest before thethrone of God, leading an angelic liturgy in the celestial throne room ando\u0010\bciating in his own tabernacle."},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"346chapter seven: introductionThis passage about the Youth appears in multiple contexts, especially onesassociated with theShi#ur Qomah. He appears in other Hekhalot texts as well:in the ascent passage in G8 (2b 13b–18a) the angel Ozhayah describes him asan important angelic \bgure who will be encountered at the throne of Godand who indeed will welcome the practitioner and seat him on his lap, butwho must on no account be worshiped. There are also passing references tothe Youth inMerkavah Rabba§ 690 andSar Panim§ 626.The Youth is an intriguing \bgure whose function is similar in many waysto that of Metatron, the angeli\bed patriarch Enoch. Indeed the manuscripttradition has often identi\bed the Youth with Metatron;3 Enoch3–4 does soas well; and scholars have often taken this identi\bcation at face value andtreated them as the same angel. Nevertheless, their independent origin andessential distinctiveness are clear. The passage in G8 and the mentions ofhim inMerkavah Rabba§ 690 andSar Panim§ 626 do not refer to Metatron.In theSar Panimhe is identi\bed with Ozhayah, the Prince of the Presence.Some versions ofThe Youthtext translated here do identify him as Metatron,but elsewhere I have shown that these passages are secondary and that thistext too originally described him without reference to the latter.3The exactrelationship between the Youth, Metatron, Enoch, and perhaps earlier divinemediator \bgures remains to be established.4The version ofThe Youthtext translated here is from aShi#ur Qomahtradition known as theSiddur Rabba, preserved in two comparatively latemanuscripts: New York JTS 1746, an Oriental manuscript of the seventeenthcentury and Jerusalem 381, a Sephardic (Balkan) manuscript of the sixteenthor seventeenth century. I translate the text of JTS 1746 as transcribed byCohen, but with reference both to Jerusalem 381 and to other re\u0000\u0002exes of thetext as relevant. I have chosen this version of the text because it preserves thedistinction between the Youth and Metatron. Metatron is never mentionedin the body of the work; the Youth stands on his own terms. The frame, whichis probably secondary, presents the passage as a tradition given to R. Ishmaelby Metatron, thus distinguishing the Youth from the latter explicitly as wellas implicitly. Schäfer has published other versions ofThe Youthtext in four3Davila, “Melchizedek, ‘the Youth,’ and Jesus” 258–261. In this article I refer to manuscriptSassoon 522 as G24. The siglum G24 has since been assigned to another Cairo Geniza text(Heb. a.3.25a = G17; see the introduction to chapter eight) and I no longer apply it to Sasson522.

These manuscripts are not always easy to work with: they are notonly fragmentary, they are themselves often quite corrupt. But their textstill comes to us without the redactional changes introduced by the ̇HasideAshkenaz(cf. G12 and GO56) and, even when corrupt, they contain a di\u0010ferentpattern of copyist errors than those in the later complete manuscripts, notinfrequently preserving better readings that would otherwise be lost (cf. thetext ofHekhalot Rabbati§ 273 in G1). In addition to the translations here,I have also collated the readings of the Geniza manuscripts in the criticalapparatuses of the relevant macroforms in the earlier chapters.1As noted in chapter one, material in square brackets is text reconstructedto \bll a lacuna. Reconstructions are based on comparison with the readingsof the later complete manuscripts in light of approximate letter counts fordamaged lines.

K 21.95.S) is a leather fragment of a scroll containing a small partof one column of text, with \bve nearly complete columns following it. Bothits beginning and its end are lost. It is unusual to \bnd a non-biblical scrollin this period, which may suggest it had a liturgical function.2This is oneof the earliest Geniza fragments, dating to before the ninth century. It ismainly a collection of hymns that are known from theHekhalot Rabbati, butthey appear here in a di\u0010ferent order. With them are a hymn known fromtheSar Torah, an adjuration of the Prince of the Presence, and the openingof theSar Panimtext, which also concerns the Prince of the Presence. Thepassages known from theHekhalot Rabbatiappear here asqedushahhymns,i.e., hymns that end by quoting from the Trisagion passage in Isa 6:3. Thistype of hymn does appear frequently in theHekhalot Rabbati, but of theseparticular passages only § 273 and § 274 appear in that form there. The lastmicroform on the leather is the beginning of the \brst paragraph of theSarPanim, with a text substantially di\u0010ferent from the one in our later, completemanuscripts. The column ends in mid-sentence and must have continued inat least one additional column. We have no way of knowing if it continuedwith some version of the completeSar Panimtext (§§ 623–639) or if thissection is an extract from a larger text. A blank space or blank line is placedbetween each paragraph in G1, but there is no other indication of divisionswithin the manuscript and no indication that theSar Panimpassage beginsa new macroform.The relationship between this scroll and the macroforms with which itshares material is unclear. It may be a fragment of a very di\u0010ferent recensionof theHekhalot Rabbatithan we know from the later, complete manuscripts;it may be an independent collection of hymns and other material thatlater went into theHekhalot Rabbatiand other macroforms; or it may be2Schäfer,Geniza-Fragmente, 9."},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"geniza fragments373a collection of passages extracted from theHekhalot Rabbatias we knowit and from other sources, reordered and redacted to suit the editor’s ownpurposes.3The identi\bable surviving text is as follows in the following order:HekhalotRabbati§ 95/155;Sar Torah§ 306;Hekhalot Rabbati§§ 271, 272, 273, 270, 275,274; an adjuration of the Prince of the Presence also found in theSynopseasaSondergutin § 501 and § 542;Hekhalot Rabbati§§ 269, 276, 277;Sar Panim§ 623.4From theHekhalot RabbatiG2 (T.-S.

It openswith an obscure and poorly-preserved story involving creation and theFlood, segueing into a mysterious description of a future sage in Babylonia.Ozhayah describes an ascent praxis called “the seal of the descent to thechariot” (2a 25) culminating in the presentation of the heavenly angelcalled “the Youth,” who greets the successful practitioner at the end of hisascent. This section closes with testimony from R. Ishmael to the e\u0010\bcacyof the praxis.

The third section (2b 44b–49a) opens with“#Anaph\"el said:” and closes with the title “the might of#Anaph\"el.” It is avariant formulation of material found inHekhalot Zutarti§§ 420–421, someof which pertains to the angel#Anaphi\"el.
